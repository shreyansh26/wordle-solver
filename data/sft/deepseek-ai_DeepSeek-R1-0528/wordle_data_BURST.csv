We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 A good starting word is often ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another popular one is ""ROATE"". However, let's choose one that has unique letters and covers two vowels and three common consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"":
   C, R, A, N, E

 This word has the vowel A and E, and consonants C, R, N which are common.

 Since it's the first guess, we are just trying to get as much information as possible.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
  The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
  The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
  - Does not contain C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word)
  - Includes the letter R (but not in the second position, because in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position)
  - We want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, we can try to put R in a different position.

Common positions for R: often at the beginning (position 1) or the end (position 5). But note: we cannot put R at position 2 again because we know it's not there.

We also need to avoid the letters C, A, N, E.

Let's think of words that have R and other common letters (like S, T, L, O, I, etc.) but without C, A, N, E.

Possible letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to maximize information: so we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.
Vowels: O, I, U (but note we already know A and E are out, so we have O, I, U and sometimes Y).

A good candidate might be a word that has R in a different position and includes other common letters.

Let's list some words:

Option 1: ""ROTLS"" - but that's not a word. We need valid words.

Option 2: ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) - valid? Yes.

But let's check: R at position 1, which is a new position. Also, we get O, I, L, S.

But we have to avoid A, E, N, C.

""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S. None of the forbidden letters.

Alternatively, ""ROUST"" (to rouse) - R, O, U, S, T.

Another one: ""POURS"" - P, O, U, R, S.

But note: we want to test R in a position that is not 2. In ""ROILS"", R is at position 1. In ""POURS"", R is at position 4.

We also want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: ""STORM"" - but we have S, T, O, R, M. However, we know from the first guess that E is not present, so that's okay. But wait, we have O and M which are new.

But note: we have to avoid A, E, N, C. ""STORM"" doesn't have any of these.

However, we already know that R is in the word, so we might want to use a word that has R and also other letters we haven't tried.

But in ""STORM"", R is at position 4, which is a new position.

But let me think: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test multiple letters.

Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 1 and then other positions.

But note: we don't know if R is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

I think ""ROILS"" is a good candidate because it has R at the start and then O, I, L, S which are common.

Another candidate: ""RUSTS"" - but that has two S's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say the word has unique letters, so duplicates are possible. But to maximize information, we might prefer all unique letters.

""ROILS"" has unique letters: R, O, I, L, S.

Similarly, ""POURS"" has P, O, U, R, S (unique).

But ""POURS"" has R at position 4.

We might also consider ""TRYST"" - T, R, Y, S, T -> but T is repeated? Actually, ""TRYST"" has two T's. And Y is a vowel.

But let's stick to words without repeated letters for now.

Another word: ""ROBOT"" - but that has two O's and two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has R, O, B, O, T -> two O's. Not ideal.

""ROWDY"" - R, O, W, D, Y. That's unique.

But we have Y, which is less common.

I think ""ROILS"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there's a word that includes T as well, because T is very common.

For example: ""ROTIS"" - not a word.

""ROTAS"" - but A is forbidden (we know A is not in the word from first guess).

We cannot use A.

So, ""ROTAS"" is invalid because it has A.

Another: ""PORTS"" - P, O, R, T, S. R is at position 3? P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). That's a valid word.

But we are trying to test R in a new position. In the first guess, R was at position 2. Now in ""PORTS"", R is at position 3. That's good.

Also, we get to test P, O, T, S.

Alternatively, ""SPORT"" - S, P, O, R, T. R is at position 4.

Both are good.

But note: we want to avoid the second position for R? Actually, we know R is not in position 2, but we don't know about other positions.

In ""PORTS"", we have O at position 2. We don't know if O is in the word.

I think ""PORTS"" is a good choice because it has common letters and R in a new position.

But let me see: we have to avoid A, E, N, C. ""PORTS"" doesn't have any of these.

Similarly, ""SPORT"" is the same letters.

But ""SPORT"" has R at position 4, which is also new.

I think I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it starts with S, which is a common letter.

But note: we don't know if S is in the word. We are testing it.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 1 to see if it fits there.

But we don't have to fix R in a specific position, we just need to test multiple possibilities.

Given that we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

In ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T. That's 5 new letters (all except R, which we know is present). And we are testing R at position 4.

But note: we are also testing S, P, O, T.

If we choose ""ROILS"", we test R at position 1, and O, I, L, S.

I think both are good. Let me pick one.

I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it has T, which is a very common letter.

So, second guess: SPORT

But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""sport"" is a valid 5-letter word.

So, we'll guess ""SPORT"".

But note: the feedback for the first guess showed R in position 2 was wrong, but R is in the word. So in ""SPORT"", we put R at position 4. If the secret word has R at position 4, we'll get a check. If not, we'll get a minus or if it's not there at all? But we know R is in the word, so it must be either position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

So, let's go with ""SPORT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: x, N: x, E: x), we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word but not in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Avoid using C, A, N, or E.
2. Include R in a position other than the second one (to test new locations).
3. Cover other common letters (e.g., S, T, O, P) to gather more information.

I chose ""sport"" because:
- It contains R (placed in position 4, a new location to test).
- It introduces new common letters: S, P, O, and T.
- All letters are unique, maximizing information potential.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

This guess will help identify if any of S, P, O, or T are in the word, and if R is correctly placed at position 4.

Option 1: ""ROTLS"" - but that's not a word. We need valid words.

Option 2: ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) - valid? Yes.

But let's check: R at position 1, which is a new position. Also, we get O, I, L, S.

But we have to avoid A, E, N, C.

""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S. None of the forbidden letters.

Alternatively, ""ROUST"" (to rouse) - R, O, U, S, T.

Another one: ""POURS"" - P, O, U, R, S.

But note: we want to test R in a position that is not 2. In ""ROILS"", R is at position 1. In ""POURS"", R is at position 4.

We also want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: ""STORM"" - but we have S, T, O, R, M. However, we know from the first guess that E is not present, so that's okay. But wait, we have O and M which are new.

But note: we have to avoid A, E, N, C. ""STORM"" doesn't have any of these.

However, we already know that R is in the word, so we might want to use a word that has R and also other letters we haven't tried.

But in ""STORM"", R is at position 4, which is a new position.

But let me think: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test multiple letters.

Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 1 and then other positions.

But note: we don't know if R is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

I think ""ROILS"" is a good candidate because it has R at the start and then O, I, L, S which are common.

Another candidate: ""RUSTS"" - but that has two S's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say the word has unique letters, so duplicates are possible. But to maximize information, we might prefer all unique letters.

""ROILS"" has unique letters: R, O, I, L, S.

Similarly, ""POURS"" has P, O, U, R, S (unique).

But ""POURS"" has R at position 4.

We might also consider ""TRYST"" - T, R, Y, S, T -> but T is repeated? Actually, ""TRYST"" has two T's. And Y is a vowel.

But let's stick to words without repeated letters for now.

Another word: ""ROBOT"" - but that has two O's and two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has R, O, B, O, T -> two O's. Not ideal.

""ROWDY"" - R, O, W, D, Y. That's unique.

But we have Y, which is less common.

I think ""ROILS"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there's a word that includes T as well, because T is very common.

For example: ""ROTIS"" - not a word.

""ROTAS"" - but A is forbidden (we know A is not in the word from first guess).

We cannot use A.

So, ""ROTAS"" is invalid because it has A.

Another: ""PORTS"" - P, O, R, T, S. R is at position 3? P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). That's a valid word.

But we are trying to test R in a new position. In the first guess, R was at position 2. Now in ""PORTS"", R is at position 3. That's good.

Also, we get to test P, O, T, S.

Alternatively, ""SPORT"" - S, P, O, R, T. R is at position 4.

Both are good.

But note: we want to avoid the second position for R? Actually, we know R is not in position 2, but we don't know about other positions.

In ""PORTS"", we have O at position 2. We don't know if O is in the word.

I think ""PORTS"" is a good choice because it has common letters and R in a new position.

But let me see: we have to avoid A, E, N, C. ""PORTS"" doesn't have any of these.

Similarly, ""SPORT"" is the same letters.

But ""SPORT"" has R at position 4, which is also new.

I think I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it starts with S, which is a common letter.

But note: we don't know if S is in the word. We are testing it.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 1 to see if it fits there.

But we don't have to fix R in a specific position, we just need to test multiple possibilities.

Given that we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

In ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T. That's 5 new letters (all except R, which we know is present). And we are testing R at position 4.

But note: we are also testing S, P, O, T.

If we choose ""ROILS"", we test R at position 1, and O, I, L, S.

I think both are good. Let me pick one.

I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it has T, which is a very common letter.

So, second guess: SPORT

But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""sport"" is a valid 5-letter word.

So, we'll guess ""SPORT"".

But note: the feedback for the first guess showed R in position 2 was wrong, but R is in the word. So in ""SPORT"", we put R at position 4. If the secret word has R at position 4, we'll get a check. If not, we'll get a minus or if it's not there at all? But we know R is in the word, so it must be either position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

So, let's go with ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: x, N: x, E: x), we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word but not in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Avoid using C, A, N, or E.
2. Include R in a position other than the second one (to test new locations).
3. Cover other common letters (e.g., S, T, O, P) to gather more information.

I chose ""sport"" because:
- It contains R (placed in position 4, a new location to test).
- It introduces new common letters: S, P, O, and T.
- All letters are unique, maximizing information potential.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

This guess will help identify if any of S, P, O, or T are in the word, and if R is correctly placed at position 4.

We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  - R is present but not in position 2 (the position it was in).
  - C, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: sport -> S(-) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(✓)
Meaning:
  - T is present and in the correct position (position 5, because in ""sport"", T is at position 5 and marked correct). So the secret word has T at the end.
  - S is present but not in position 1.
  - R is present but not in position 4 (it was in position 4 in this guess).
  - P and O are absent.

Therefore, we now know:

1. The secret word ends with T (position 5: T).
2. The letters S and R are present in the word, but:
   - R is NOT in position 2 (from guess 1) and NOT in position 4 (from guess 2).
   - S is NOT in position 1 (from guess 2).
3. The following letters are absent: C, A, N, E, P, O.

We also know the secret word must contain R and S, and we have T fixed at position 5.

Since T is at position 5, and the word is 5 letters, we can represent the word as: _ _ _ _ T

The letters we have so far in the word: R, S, T (and the fixed T).

But note: we don't know the other letters yet.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

For the next guess, we need to:
- Include R and S (since we know they are in the word).
- Avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, P, O.
- Make sure R is not in position 2 or 4 (but we can try other positions: 1, 3).
- Make sure S is not in position 1 (so we can put it in positions 2, 3, or 4).

Additionally, we want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

Common letters that haven't been tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with T, and including R and S, without the forbidden letters.

Let me consider words ending with T that have R and S and avoid C,A,N,E,P,O.

Some ideas:

- We can try placing S in position 2 and R in position 3? Example: ? S R ? T

Possible words: 
  ""USURT"" - not a valid word.
  ""VISIT"" - has I at position 2 and 4, but it ends with T. However, we need R. And ""visit"" doesn't have R.
  Not working.

- Place S in position 3 and R in position 1: R _ S _ T

Example: ""TRUST"" - but T is already at position 5? Actually, ""TRUST"" has T at the end and S at the end? No: T-R-U-S-T -> positions: T (1), R (2), U (3), S (4), T (5). 
But we have T at the end, so that's good. However, we have two T's? The feedback for ""sport"" showed T as correct at position 5, but we don't know if there is another T. But ""trust"" has T at the beginning and end. 
Also, we have S at position 4. The word has R at position 2? But we know from guess 1 that R cannot be in position 2. So if we guess ""trust"", we would put R at position 2, which is forbidden because we know R is not in position 2.

So ""trust"" is invalid because R is in position 2.

Another word: ""FIRST"" - F-I-R-S-T. 
This ends with T. R is at position 3 (which is acceptable, since we haven't tried position 3 for R). S is at position 4 (not 1, which is good). 
Now, check if the letters are allowed: F, I, R, S, T. 
Are any forbidden? We've avoided C,A,N,E,P,O. Yes. 
So ""first"" could be a candidate.

But let's see the pattern: F(1)-I(2)-R(3)-S(4)-T(5). 
We know S cannot be in position 1 (which is fine here), and R cannot be in 2 or 4 (here R is in 3, so okay).

This guess tests F and I as new letters.

Another candidate: ""WORST"" - W-O-R-S-T ... but O is in the word? We know O is absent (from guess 2). So we cannot use ""worst"" because it has O.

Another: ""BURST"" - B-U-R-S-T. Ends with T, R in position 3, S in position 4. Letters: B, U, R, S, T. None are forbidden (C,A,N,E,P,O are out). So ""burst"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""GIRST"" ... is girst a word? Not really. ""GRIFT"" doesn't have S. ""FIRST"" and ""BURST"" are good.

Another: ""SHIRT"" - S-H-I-R-T. This ends with T? S-H-I-R-T -> positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). But wait, T is at the end, good. But S is at position 1? The feedback from guess 2 told us that S is present but not in position 1. So if we put S in position 1, it would be wrong? Meaning if S were in position 1, it would have been marked accordingly. Since it was marked as absent in position 1 (but present elsewhere) we must avoid position 1 for S.

In ""shirt"", S is at position 1, which we must avoid because we know S is not in position 1.

So we cannot guess words with S at position 1.

Therefore, ""shirt"" is invalid for that reason.

Similarly, ""START"" - S at 1? And T at 5, but S at 1 is forbidden. Also, A is absent, so invalid anyway.

So back to ""first"" and ""burst"".

We can also consider: ""DRIFT"" - ends with T? D-R-I-F-T -> positions: D(1), R(2), I(3), F(4), T(5). But R is at position 2? We know R is not in position 2 (from guess 1). So ""drift"" has R at 2, which is invalid.

Another: ""GRITS"" ... but doesn't end with T? ""GRIT"" is 4 letters. Not 5.

""WREST"" - W-R-E-S-T ... but E is absent (from guess 1) and R is at position 2. So invalid.

Another word: ""MURST"" ... not a word.

""BLAST"" ... but A is absent and S at position 2? But A is absent and we have S? Also, it ends with T? B-L-A-S-T -> but A is absent, so invalid.

So ""first"" and ""burst"" seem good.

We can also try ""DUSTY"" ... but doesn't have R? We must have R in the word.

So we need R and S.

Another candidate: ""FRISE"" ... but E is absent? And it doesn't end with T? No.

What about ""TRYST"" ... T-R-Y-S-T ... but T is at the beginning and end? And R is at position 2? Which is forbidden. Also, we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? But we already have T at the end, and if we guess T at position 1, it might be marked differently? But ""TRYST"" has two T's? And R at position 2 is not allowed.

So ""first"" and ""burst"" are the top candidates.

Now, between ""first"" and ""burst"", which one gives more information?

Both have R at position 3 and S at position 4. So the pattern: _ _ R S T

The only difference is the first and second letters: for ""first"" we test F and I, for ""burst"" we test B and U.

Both F and B are common consonants, while I and U are vowels. We haven't tested any vowels except A,E,O (which are absent), so we have I and U as possibilities. Since we know that at least two vowels? Not necessarily, but words usually have vowels.

Another candidate: ""WORST"" ... but O is absent.

Another: ""JIRST"" ... not a word.

""FIRST"" is a common word, and ""BURST"" is also common.

We can also consider ""CURST"" ... but C is absent? And it is not common.

I think ""first"" is a good choice.

But note: In the feedback from guess 2, S was at position 1 and marked as present but wrong position. Now, in ""first"", we put S at position 4. Similarly, R was at position 4 and now at position 3.

This might help us determine the position of R and S.

Moreover, by placing R at position 3 and S at position 4, we avoid the incorrect positions we tried before.

So I'll go with ""first"".

But wait, what about ""burst""? Is it better? Both are similar.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a new position. We have tried R in position 2 and 4, so now in position 3. We haven't tried position 1 or 5? But position 5 is T, so R cannot be at 5. Position 1 is still possible? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

But in ""first"", R is at position 3, not 1.

What if R is at position 1? Then we should try a word with R at the beginning.

For example: R ? ? ? T

And must include S, and avoid C,A,N,E,P,O.

And S cannot be in position 1? Position 1 is R, so S can be in 2,3,4.

Example words:

- ""RUSTY"" ... but no T at the end? It ends with Y. And we need T at the end? Our fixed T at the end? ""RUSTY"" ends with Y, not T.

- ""RULER"" ... doesn't end with T.

- ""RIFTS"" - R-I-F-T-S ... ends with S, not T.

- ""RAFTS"" ... A is absent.

- ""RANTS"" ... N absent.

- ""RESTS"" ... E absent.

- ""RISKS"" ... ends with S, not T.

- ""ROOTS"" ... O absent.

It seems hard to find a word starting with R, ending with T, having S, and avoiding the forbidden letters.

Maybe ""RYOTS"" ... is it a word? ryot: a peasant, but plural ryots? Not standard.

""ROSTS"" ... not a word.

""RUSTS"" ... ends with S, not T.

So perhaps it is difficult? Maybe R is not in position 1? We don't know, but later we can test.

We have ""first"" and ""burst"", which are good.

Another word: ""MERIT"" ... but E is absent? and it doesn't have S? and ends with T? M-E-R-I-T -> E is absent, so invalid.

We can also consider ""GUEST"" ... E absent? and it doesn't have R.

No.

Perhaps ""BRUST"" ... not a word? Burst is the word, but we already considered ""burst"".

So between ""first"" and ""burst"", I'll choose ""first"" because F and I are common.

But note: in ""first"", we are testing:

- Position 1: F
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: T (fixed, already correct)

We know position 5 is correct and fixed. We are trying to find the first four.

The feedback will tell us:
- If F is in the word and in the correct position? 
- If I is in the word? 
And confirm R at position 3? And S at position 4? But they might not be correct if the word doesn't have R at 3 or S at 4.

Since we suspect R at position 3? But we don't know.

I think ""first"" is a solid guess.

So let's go with ""first"".

But wait, we have another idea: what about ""TRYST""? We rejected because R is at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2.

No.

Another: ""DISTR"" ... doesn't end with T? No.

So I think ""first"" is fine.

But let me check: we are not forced to have the T at the end? But we know T is at the end, so yes, we must include T at position 5.

Therefore, we can generate words ending with T and containing R and S.

Word list: first, burst, worst (invalid due to O), wrist, grist, mistr (no).

""wrist"" - W-R-I-S-T: ends with T? W-R-I-S-T -> positions: W(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). But R is at position 2! Which we know is incorrect (R cannot be at position 2). So ""wrist"" is invalid.

""grist"" - G-R-I-S-T: R at position 2? Same problem.

""frits"" - F-R-I-T-S ... but ends with S, not T? and T at position 4? Not ending with T.

So indeed, ""first"" and ""burst"" are among the few.

We can also consider ""LISTR"" ... not a word.

""SHIRT"" - already considered and S at position 1 not allowed.

Another word: ""HIRST"" - meaning a hill, but uncommon? It ends with T? H-I-R-S-T? Positions: H(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). So same as ""first"". H, I, R, S, T. Only first letter different? And H and F are both possible.

But ""hirst"" is a valid word? I think so, but obscure.

Similarly, ""first"" is more common and thus a better choice.

Therefore, we'll guess ""first"".

In summary, our reasoning:

- T is fixed at position 5.
- R must be in a position other than 2 or 4: so positions 1, 3.
- S must be in a position other than 1: so positions 2, 3, 4.
- Avoid letters: C, A, N, E, P, O.
- Include R and S.

""first"" has R at position 3 (allowed), S at position 4 (allowed), avoids bad letters, and tests F and I.

So we'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (sport)**: T is in the correct position (5). S is in the word but not in position 1. R is in the word but not in position 4. P and O are absent.

### Key Deductions:
- **Fixed Position**: Position 5 is T.
- **Confirmed Present Letters**: R, S, T (T is fixed at position 5).
- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, P, O.
- **Position Constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 (from guess 1) or 4 (from guess 2), so possible positions are 1 or 3.
- **Position Constraints for S**: Cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2), so possible positions are 2, 3, or 4.
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word must be _ _ _ _ T, containing R and S, avoiding absent letters.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Use a word ending in T to leverage the fixed position.
- Include R and S in new untested positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 1 for S).
- Test new common letters (e.g., consonants like B, F, or vowels I, U) for the remaining positions.
- Avoid repeating previous letters or using absent letters.

Chose ""first"" because:
- Ends with T (fixed), so position 5 is already correct.
- Places R at position 3 (untested and allowed position).
- Places S at position 4 (untested and allowed position).
- Tests new letters: F (position 1) and I (position 2).
- Avoids absent letters (C, A, N, E, P, O).

<guess>first</guess>",first,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  - R is present but not in position 2 (the position it was in).
  - C, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: sport -> S(-) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(✓)
Meaning:
  - T is present and in the correct position (position 5, because in ""sport"", T is at position 5 and marked correct). So the secret word has T at the end.
  - S is present but not in position 1.
  - R is present but not in position 4 (it was in position 4 in this guess).
  - P and O are absent.

Therefore, we now know:

1. The secret word ends with T (position 5: T).
2. The letters S and R are present in the word, but:
   - R is NOT in position 2 (from guess 1) and NOT in position 4 (from guess 2).
   - S is NOT in position 1 (from guess 2).
3. The following letters are absent: C, A, N, E, P, O.

We also know the secret word must contain R and S, and we have T fixed at position 5.

Since T is at position 5, and the word is 5 letters, we can represent the word as: _ _ _ _ T

The letters we have so far in the word: R, S, T (and the fixed T).

But note: we don't know the other letters yet.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

For the next guess, we need to:
- Include R and S (since we know they are in the word).
- Avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, P, O.
- Make sure R is not in position 2 or 4 (but we can try other positions: 1, 3).
- Make sure S is not in position 1 (so we can put it in positions 2, 3, or 4).

Additionally, we want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

Common letters that haven't been tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with T, and including R and S, without the forbidden letters.

Let me consider words ending with T that have R and S and avoid C,A,N,E,P,O.

Some ideas:

- We can try placing S in position 2 and R in position 3? Example: ? S R ? T

Possible words: 
  ""USURT"" - not a valid word.
  ""VISIT"" - has I at position 2 and 4, but it ends with T. However, we need R. And ""visit"" doesn't have R.
  Not working.

- Place S in position 3 and R in position 1: R _ S _ T

Example: ""TRUST"" - but T is already at position 5? Actually, ""TRUST"" has T at the end and S at the end? No: T-R-U-S-T -> positions: T (1), R (2), U (3), S (4), T (5). 
But we have T at the end, so that's good. However, we have two T's? The feedback for ""sport"" showed T as correct at position 5, but we don't know if there is another T. But ""trust"" has T at the beginning and end. 
Also, we have S at position 4. The word has R at position 2? But we know from guess 1 that R cannot be in position 2. So if we guess ""trust"", we would put R at position 2, which is forbidden because we know R is not in position 2.

So ""trust"" is invalid because R is in position 2.

Another word: ""FIRST"" - F-I-R-S-T. 
This ends with T. R is at position 3 (which is acceptable, since we haven't tried position 3 for R). S is at position 4 (not 1, which is good). 
Now, check if the letters are allowed: F, I, R, S, T. 
Are any forbidden? We've avoided C,A,N,E,P,O. Yes. 
So ""first"" could be a candidate.

But let's see the pattern: F(1)-I(2)-R(3)-S(4)-T(5). 
We know S cannot be in position 1 (which is fine here), and R cannot be in 2 or 4 (here R is in 3, so okay).

This guess tests F and I as new letters.

Another candidate: ""WORST"" - W-O-R-S-T ... but O is in the word? We know O is absent (from guess 2). So we cannot use ""worst"" because it has O.

Another: ""BURST"" - B-U-R-S-T. Ends with T, R in position 3, S in position 4. Letters: B, U, R, S, T. None are forbidden (C,A,N,E,P,O are out). So ""burst"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""GIRST"" ... is girst a word? Not really. ""GRIFT"" doesn't have S. ""FIRST"" and ""BURST"" are good.

Another: ""SHIRT"" - S-H-I-R-T. This ends with T? S-H-I-R-T -> positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). But wait, T is at the end, good. But S is at position 1? The feedback from guess 2 told us that S is present but not in position 1. So if we put S in position 1, it would be wrong? Meaning if S were in position 1, it would have been marked accordingly. Since it was marked as absent in position 1 (but present elsewhere) we must avoid position 1 for S.

In ""shirt"", S is at position 1, which we must avoid because we know S is not in position 1.

So we cannot guess words with S at position 1.

Therefore, ""shirt"" is invalid for that reason.

Similarly, ""START"" - S at 1? And T at 5, but S at 1 is forbidden. Also, A is absent, so invalid anyway.

So back to ""first"" and ""burst"".

We can also consider: ""DRIFT"" - ends with T? D-R-I-F-T -> positions: D(1), R(2), I(3), F(4), T(5). But R is at position 2? We know R is not in position 2 (from guess 1). So ""drift"" has R at 2, which is invalid.

Another: ""GRITS"" ... but doesn't end with T? ""GRIT"" is 4 letters. Not 5.

""WREST"" - W-R-E-S-T ... but E is absent (from guess 1) and R is at position 2. So invalid.

Another word: ""MURST"" ... not a word.

""BLAST"" ... but A is absent and S at position 2? But A is absent and we have S? Also, it ends with T? B-L-A-S-T -> but A is absent, so invalid.

So ""first"" and ""burst"" seem good.

We can also try ""DUSTY"" ... but doesn't have R? We must have R in the word.

So we need R and S.

Another candidate: ""FRISE"" ... but E is absent? And it doesn't end with T? No.

What about ""TRYST"" ... T-R-Y-S-T ... but T is at the beginning and end? And R is at position 2? Which is forbidden. Also, we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? But we already have T at the end, and if we guess T at position 1, it might be marked differently? But ""TRYST"" has two T's? And R at position 2 is not allowed.

So ""first"" and ""burst"" are the top candidates.

Now, between ""first"" and ""burst"", which one gives more information?

Both have R at position 3 and S at position 4. So the pattern: _ _ R S T

The only difference is the first and second letters: for ""first"" we test F and I, for ""burst"" we test B and U.

Both F and B are common consonants, while I and U are vowels. We haven't tested any vowels except A,E,O (which are absent), so we have I and U as possibilities. Since we know that at least two vowels? Not necessarily, but words usually have vowels.

Another candidate: ""WORST"" ... but O is absent.

Another: ""JIRST"" ... not a word.

""FIRST"" is a common word, and ""BURST"" is also common.

We can also consider ""CURST"" ... but C is absent? And it is not common.

I think ""first"" is a good choice.

But note: In the feedback from guess 2, S was at position 1 and marked as present but wrong position. Now, in ""first"", we put S at position 4. Similarly, R was at position 4 and now at position 3.

This might help us determine the position of R and S.

Moreover, by placing R at position 3 and S at position 4, we avoid the incorrect positions we tried before.

So I'll go with ""first"".

But wait, what about ""burst""? Is it better? Both are similar.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a new position. We have tried R in position 2 and 4, so now in position 3. We haven't tried position 1 or 5? But position 5 is T, so R cannot be at 5. Position 1 is still possible? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

But in ""first"", R is at position 3, not 1.

What if R is at position 1? Then we should try a word with R at the beginning.

For example: R ? ? ? T

And must include S, and avoid C,A,N,E,P,O.

And S cannot be in position 1? Position 1 is R, so S can be in 2,3,4.

Example words:

- ""RUSTY"" ... but no T at the end? It ends with Y. And we need T at the end? Our fixed T at the end? ""RUSTY"" ends with Y, not T.

- ""RULER"" ... doesn't end with T.

- ""RIFTS"" - R-I-F-T-S ... ends with S, not T.

- ""RAFTS"" ... A is absent.

- ""RANTS"" ... N absent.

- ""RESTS"" ... E absent.

- ""RISKS"" ... ends with S, not T.

- ""ROOTS"" ... O absent.

It seems hard to find a word starting with R, ending with T, having S, and avoiding the forbidden letters.

Maybe ""RYOTS"" ... is it a word? ryot: a peasant, but plural ryots? Not standard.

""ROSTS"" ... not a word.

""RUSTS"" ... ends with S, not T.

So perhaps it is difficult? Maybe R is not in position 1? We don't know, but later we can test.

We have ""first"" and ""burst"", which are good.

Another word: ""MERIT"" ... but E is absent? and it doesn't have S? and ends with T? M-E-R-I-T -> E is absent, so invalid.

We can also consider ""GUEST"" ... E absent? and it doesn't have R.

No.

Perhaps ""BRUST"" ... not a word? Burst is the word, but we already considered ""burst"".

So between ""first"" and ""burst"", I'll choose ""first"" because F and I are common.

But note: in ""first"", we are testing:

- Position 1: F
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: T (fixed, already correct)

We know position 5 is correct and fixed. We are trying to find the first four.

The feedback will tell us:
- If F is in the word and in the correct position? 
- If I is in the word? 
And confirm R at position 3? And S at position 4? But they might not be correct if the word doesn't have R at 3 or S at 4.

Since we suspect R at position 3? But we don't know.

I think ""first"" is a solid guess.

So let's go with ""first"".

But wait, we have another idea: what about ""TRYST""? We rejected because R is at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2.

No.

Another: ""DISTR"" ... doesn't end with T? No.

So I think ""first"" is fine.

But let me check: we are not forced to have the T at the end? But we know T is at the end, so yes, we must include T at position 5.

Therefore, we can generate words ending with T and containing R and S.

Word list: first, burst, worst (invalid due to O), wrist, grist, mistr (no).

""wrist"" - W-R-I-S-T: ends with T? W-R-I-S-T -> positions: W(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). But R is at position 2! Which we know is incorrect (R cannot be at position 2). So ""wrist"" is invalid.

""grist"" - G-R-I-S-T: R at position 2? Same problem.

""frits"" - F-R-I-T-S ... but ends with S, not T? and T at position 4? Not ending with T.

So indeed, ""first"" and ""burst"" are among the few.

We can also consider ""LISTR"" ... not a word.

""SHIRT"" - already considered and S at position 1 not allowed.

Another word: ""HIRST"" - meaning a hill, but uncommon? It ends with T? H-I-R-S-T? Positions: H(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). So same as ""first"". H, I, R, S, T. Only first letter different? And H and F are both possible.

But ""hirst"" is a valid word? I think so, but obscure.

Similarly, ""first"" is more common and thus a better choice.

Therefore, we'll guess ""first"".

In summary, our reasoning:

- T is fixed at position 5.
- R must be in a position other than 2 or 4: so positions 1, 3.
- S must be in a position other than 1: so positions 2, 3, 4.
- Avoid letters: C, A, N, E, P, O.
- Include R and S.

""first"" has R at position 3 (allowed), S at position 4 (allowed), avoids bad letters, and tests F and I.

So we'll go with that.Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (sport)**: T is in the correct position (5). S is in the word but not in position 1. R is in the word but not in position 4. P and O are absent.

### Key Deductions:
- **Fixed Position**: Position 5 is T.
- **Confirmed Present Letters**: R, S, T (T is fixed at position 5).
- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, P, O.
- **Position Constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 (from guess 1) or 4 (from guess 2), so possible positions are 1 or 3.
- **Position Constraints for S**: Cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2), so possible positions are 2, 3, or 4.
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word must be _ _ _ _ T, containing R and S, avoiding absent letters.

- Use a word ending in T to leverage the fixed position.

- Avoids absent letters (C, A, N, E, P, O).",Guess 3: first -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(x) R(✓) S(✓) T(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter English words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 A good starting word is often ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another popular one is ""ROATE"". However, let's choose one that has unique letters and covers two vowels and three common consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"":
   C, R, A, N, E

 This word has the vowel A and E, and consonants C, R, N which are common.

 Since it's the first guess, we are just trying to get as much information as possible.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
  The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R is at position 2 and we got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
  The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

For the next guess, we want to choose a word that:
  - Does not contain C, A, N, E (since they are not in the word)
  - Includes the letter R (but not in the second position, because in the first guess R was in position 2 and it was marked as wrong position)
  - We want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2, we can try to put R in a different position.

Common positions for R: often at the beginning (position 1) or the end (position 5). But note: we cannot put R at position 2 again because we know it's not there.

We also need to avoid the letters C, A, N, E.

Let's think of words that have R and other common letters (like S, T, L, O, I, etc.) but without C, A, N, E.

Possible letters to try: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want to maximize information: so we should try to include as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.
Vowels: O, I, U (but note we already know A and E are out, so we have O, I, U and sometimes Y).

A good candidate might be a word that has R in a different position and includes other common letters.

Let's list some words:

Option 1: ""ROTLS"" - but that's not a word. We need valid words.

Option 2: ""ROILS"" (meaning: to agitate) - valid? Yes.

But let's check: R at position 1, which is a new position. Also, we get O, I, L, S.

But we have to avoid A, E, N, C.

""ROILS"": R, O, I, L, S. None of the forbidden letters.

Alternatively, ""ROUST"" (to rouse) - R, O, U, S, T.

Another one: ""POURS"" - P, O, U, R, S.

But note: we want to test R in a position that is not 2. In ""ROILS"", R is at position 1. In ""POURS"", R is at position 4.

We also want to cover more common letters.

Another idea: ""STORM"" - but we have S, T, O, R, M. However, we know from the first guess that E is not present, so that's okay. But wait, we have O and M which are new.

But note: we have to avoid A, E, N, C. ""STORM"" doesn't have any of these.

However, we already know that R is in the word, so we might want to use a word that has R and also other letters we haven't tried.

But in ""STORM"", R is at position 4, which is a new position.

But let me think: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test multiple letters.

Alternatively, we can try to put R in position 1 and then other positions.

But note: we don't know if R is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

I think ""ROILS"" is a good candidate because it has R at the start and then O, I, L, S which are common.

Another candidate: ""RUSTS"" - but that has two S's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say the word has unique letters, so duplicates are possible. But to maximize information, we might prefer all unique letters.

""ROILS"" has unique letters: R, O, I, L, S.

Similarly, ""POURS"" has P, O, U, R, S (unique).

But ""POURS"" has R at position 4.

We might also consider ""TRYST"" - T, R, Y, S, T -> but T is repeated? Actually, ""TRYST"" has two T's. And Y is a vowel.

But let's stick to words without repeated letters for now.

Another word: ""ROBOT"" - but that has two O's and two O's? Actually, ""ROBOT"" has R, O, B, O, T -> two O's. Not ideal.

""ROWDY"" - R, O, W, D, Y. That's unique.

But we have Y, which is less common.

I think ""ROILS"" is a good choice.

But let me check if there's a word that includes T as well, because T is very common.

For example: ""ROTIS"" - not a word.

""ROTAS"" - but A is forbidden (we know A is not in the word from first guess).

We cannot use A.

So, ""ROTAS"" is invalid because it has A.

Another: ""PORTS"" - P, O, R, T, S. R is at position 3? P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). That's a valid word.

But we are trying to test R in a new position. In the first guess, R was at position 2. Now in ""PORTS"", R is at position 3. That's good.

Also, we get to test P, O, T, S.

Alternatively, ""SPORT"" - S, P, O, R, T. R is at position 4.

Both are good.

But note: we want to avoid the second position for R? Actually, we know R is not in position 2, but we don't know about other positions.

In ""PORTS"", we have O at position 2. We don't know if O is in the word.

I think ""PORTS"" is a good choice because it has common letters and R in a new position.

But let me see: we have to avoid A, E, N, C. ""PORTS"" doesn't have any of these.

Similarly, ""SPORT"" is the same letters.

But ""SPORT"" has R at position 4, which is also new.

I think I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it starts with S, which is a common letter.

But note: we don't know if S is in the word. We are testing it.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at position 1 to see if it fits there.

But we don't have to fix R in a specific position, we just need to test multiple possibilities.

Given that we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

In ""SPORT"": S, P, O, R, T. That's 5 new letters (all except R, which we know is present). And we are testing R at position 4.

But note: we are also testing S, P, O, T.

If we choose ""ROILS"", we test R at position 1, and O, I, L, S.

I think both are good. Let me pick one.

I'll go with ""SPORT"" because it has T, which is a very common letter.

So, second guess: SPORT

But wait, we have to make sure it's a valid word. Yes, ""sport"" is a valid 5-letter word.

So, we'll guess ""SPORT"".

But note: the feedback for the first guess showed R in position 2 was wrong, but R is in the word. So in ""SPORT"", we put R at position 4. If the secret word has R at position 4, we'll get a check. If not, we'll get a minus or if it's not there at all? But we know R is in the word, so it must be either position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

So, let's go with ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: x, N: x, E: x), we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word but not in the second position.
- The letters C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

For the next guess, I need to:
1. Avoid using C, A, N, or E.
2. Include R in a position other than the second one (to test new locations).
3. Cover other common letters (e.g., S, T, O, P) to gather more information.

I chose ""sport"" because:
- It contains R (placed in position 4, a new location to test).
- It introduces new common letters: S, P, O, and T.
- All letters are unique, maximizing information potential.
- It avoids the forbidden letters (C, A, N, E).

This guess will help identify if any of S, P, O, or T are in the word, and if R is correctly placed at position 4.

<guess>sport</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  - R is present but not in position 2 (the position it was in).
  - C, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: sport -> S(-) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(✓)
Meaning:
  - T is present and in the correct position (position 5, because in ""sport"", T is at position 5 and marked correct). So the secret word has T at the end.
  - S is present but not in position 1.
  - R is present but not in position 4 (it was in position 4 in this guess).
  - P and O are absent.

Therefore, we now know:

1. The secret word ends with T (position 5: T).
2. The letters S and R are present in the word, but:
   - R is NOT in position 2 (from guess 1) and NOT in position 4 (from guess 2).
   - S is NOT in position 1 (from guess 2).
3. The following letters are absent: C, A, N, E, P, O.

We also know the secret word must contain R and S, and we have T fixed at position 5.

Since T is at position 5, and the word is 5 letters, we can represent the word as: _ _ _ _ T

The letters we have so far in the word: R, S, T (and the fixed T).

But note: we don't know the other letters yet.

We have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.

For the next guess, we need to:
- Include R and S (since we know they are in the word).
- Avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, P, O.
- Make sure R is not in position 2 or 4 (but we can try other positions: 1, 3).
- Make sure S is not in position 1 (so we can put it in positions 2, 3, or 4).

Additionally, we want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

Common letters that haven't been tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word ending with T, and including R and S, without the forbidden letters.

Let me consider words ending with T that have R and S and avoid C,A,N,E,P,O.

Some ideas:

- We can try placing S in position 2 and R in position 3? Example: ? S R ? T

Possible words: 
  ""USURT"" - not a valid word.
  ""VISIT"" - has I at position 2 and 4, but it ends with T. However, we need R. And ""visit"" doesn't have R.
  Not working.

- Place S in position 3 and R in position 1: R _ S _ T

Example: ""TRUST"" - but T is already at position 5? Actually, ""TRUST"" has T at the end and S at the end? No: T-R-U-S-T -> positions: T (1), R (2), U (3), S (4), T (5). 
But we have T at the end, so that's good. However, we have two T's? The feedback for ""sport"" showed T as correct at position 5, but we don't know if there is another T. But ""trust"" has T at the beginning and end. 
Also, we have S at position 4. The word has R at position 2? But we know from guess 1 that R cannot be in position 2. So if we guess ""trust"", we would put R at position 2, which is forbidden because we know R is not in position 2.

So ""trust"" is invalid because R is in position 2.

Another word: ""FIRST"" - F-I-R-S-T. 
This ends with T. R is at position 3 (which is acceptable, since we haven't tried position 3 for R). S is at position 4 (not 1, which is good). 
Now, check if the letters are allowed: F, I, R, S, T. 
Are any forbidden? We've avoided C,A,N,E,P,O. Yes. 
So ""first"" could be a candidate.

But let's see the pattern: F(1)-I(2)-R(3)-S(4)-T(5). 
We know S cannot be in position 1 (which is fine here), and R cannot be in 2 or 4 (here R is in 3, so okay).

This guess tests F and I as new letters.

Another candidate: ""WORST"" - W-O-R-S-T ... but O is in the word? We know O is absent (from guess 2). So we cannot use ""worst"" because it has O.

Another: ""BURST"" - B-U-R-S-T. Ends with T, R in position 3, S in position 4. Letters: B, U, R, S, T. None are forbidden (C,A,N,E,P,O are out). So ""burst"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""GIRST"" ... is girst a word? Not really. ""GRIFT"" doesn't have S. ""FIRST"" and ""BURST"" are good.

Another: ""SHIRT"" - S-H-I-R-T. This ends with T? S-H-I-R-T -> positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). But wait, T is at the end, good. But S is at position 1? The feedback from guess 2 told us that S is present but not in position 1. So if we put S in position 1, it would be wrong? Meaning if S were in position 1, it would have been marked accordingly. Since it was marked as absent in position 1 (but present elsewhere) we must avoid position 1 for S.

In ""shirt"", S is at position 1, which we must avoid because we know S is not in position 1.

So we cannot guess words with S at position 1.

Therefore, ""shirt"" is invalid for that reason.

Similarly, ""START"" - S at 1? And T at 5, but S at 1 is forbidden. Also, A is absent, so invalid anyway.

So back to ""first"" and ""burst"".

We can also consider: ""DRIFT"" - ends with T? D-R-I-F-T -> positions: D(1), R(2), I(3), F(4), T(5). But R is at position 2? We know R is not in position 2 (from guess 1). So ""drift"" has R at 2, which is invalid.

Another: ""GRITS"" ... but doesn't end with T? ""GRIT"" is 4 letters. Not 5.

""WREST"" - W-R-E-S-T ... but E is absent (from guess 1) and R is at position 2. So invalid.

Another word: ""MURST"" ... not a word.

""BLAST"" ... but A is absent and S at position 2? But A is absent and we have S? Also, it ends with T? B-L-A-S-T -> but A is absent, so invalid.

So ""first"" and ""burst"" seem good.

We can also try ""DUSTY"" ... but doesn't have R? We must have R in the word.

So we need R and S.

Another candidate: ""FRISE"" ... but E is absent? And it doesn't end with T? No.

What about ""TRYST"" ... T-R-Y-S-T ... but T is at the beginning and end? And R is at position 2? Which is forbidden. Also, we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? But we already have T at the end, and if we guess T at position 1, it might be marked differently? But ""TRYST"" has two T's? And R at position 2 is not allowed.

So ""first"" and ""burst"" are the top candidates.

Now, between ""first"" and ""burst"", which one gives more information?

Both have R at position 3 and S at position 4. So the pattern: _ _ R S T

The only difference is the first and second letters: for ""first"" we test F and I, for ""burst"" we test B and U.

Both F and B are common consonants, while I and U are vowels. We haven't tested any vowels except A,E,O (which are absent), so we have I and U as possibilities. Since we know that at least two vowels? Not necessarily, but words usually have vowels.

Another candidate: ""WORST"" ... but O is absent.

Another: ""JIRST"" ... not a word.

""FIRST"" is a common word, and ""BURST"" is also common.

We can also consider ""CURST"" ... but C is absent? And it is not common.

I think ""first"" is a good choice.

But note: In the feedback from guess 2, S was at position 1 and marked as present but wrong position. Now, in ""first"", we put S at position 4. Similarly, R was at position 4 and now at position 3.

This might help us determine the position of R and S.

Moreover, by placing R at position 3 and S at position 4, we avoid the incorrect positions we tried before.

So I'll go with ""first"".

But wait, what about ""burst""? Is it better? Both are similar.

Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a new position. We have tried R in position 2 and 4, so now in position 3. We haven't tried position 1 or 5? But position 5 is T, so R cannot be at 5. Position 1 is still possible? We haven't tried position 1 for R.

But in ""first"", R is at position 3, not 1.

What if R is at position 1? Then we should try a word with R at the beginning.

For example: R ? ? ? T

And must include S, and avoid C,A,N,E,P,O.

And S cannot be in position 1? Position 1 is R, so S can be in 2,3,4.

Example words:

- ""RUSTY"" ... but no T at the end? It ends with Y. And we need T at the end? Our fixed T at the end? ""RUSTY"" ends with Y, not T.

- ""RULER"" ... doesn't end with T.

- ""RIFTS"" - R-I-F-T-S ... ends with S, not T.

- ""RAFTS"" ... A is absent.

- ""RANTS"" ... N absent.

- ""RESTS"" ... E absent.

- ""RISKS"" ... ends with S, not T.

- ""ROOTS"" ... O absent.

It seems hard to find a word starting with R, ending with T, having S, and avoiding the forbidden letters.

Maybe ""RYOTS"" ... is it a word? ryot: a peasant, but plural ryots? Not standard.

""ROSTS"" ... not a word.

""RUSTS"" ... ends with S, not T.

So perhaps it is difficult? Maybe R is not in position 1? We don't know, but later we can test.

We have ""first"" and ""burst"", which are good.

Another word: ""MERIT"" ... but E is absent? and it doesn't have S? and ends with T? M-E-R-I-T -> E is absent, so invalid.

We can also consider ""GUEST"" ... E absent? and it doesn't have R.

No.

Perhaps ""BRUST"" ... not a word? Burst is the word, but we already considered ""burst"".

So between ""first"" and ""burst"", I'll choose ""first"" because F and I are common.

But note: in ""first"", we are testing:

- Position 1: F
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: R
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: T (fixed, already correct)

We know position 5 is correct and fixed. We are trying to find the first four.

The feedback will tell us:
- If F is in the word and in the correct position? 
- If I is in the word? 
And confirm R at position 3? And S at position 4? But they might not be correct if the word doesn't have R at 3 or S at 4.

Since we suspect R at position 3? But we don't know.

I think ""first"" is a solid guess.

So let's go with ""first"".

But wait, we have another idea: what about ""TRYST""? We rejected because R is at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2.

No.

Another: ""DISTR"" ... doesn't end with T? No.

So I think ""first"" is fine.

But let me check: we are not forced to have the T at the end? But we know T is at the end, so yes, we must include T at position 5.

Therefore, we can generate words ending with T and containing R and S.

Word list: first, burst, worst (invalid due to O), wrist, grist, mistr (no).

""wrist"" - W-R-I-S-T: ends with T? W-R-I-S-T -> positions: W(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). But R is at position 2! Which we know is incorrect (R cannot be at position 2). So ""wrist"" is invalid.

""grist"" - G-R-I-S-T: R at position 2? Same problem.

""frits"" - F-R-I-T-S ... but ends with S, not T? and T at position 4? Not ending with T.

So indeed, ""first"" and ""burst"" are among the few.

We can also consider ""LISTR"" ... not a word.

""SHIRT"" - already considered and S at position 1 not allowed.

Another word: ""HIRST"" - meaning a hill, but uncommon? It ends with T? H-I-R-S-T? Positions: H(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). So same as ""first"". H, I, R, S, T. Only first letter different? And H and F are both possible.

But ""hirst"" is a valid word? I think so, but obscure.

Similarly, ""first"" is more common and thus a better choice.

Therefore, we'll guess ""first"".

In summary, our reasoning:

- T is fixed at position 5.
- R must be in a position other than 2 or 4: so positions 1, 3.
- S must be in a position other than 1: so positions 2, 3, 4.
- Avoid letters: C, A, N, E, P, O.
- Include R and S.

""first"" has R at position 3 (allowed), S at position 4 (allowed), avoids bad letters, and tests F and I.

So we'll go with that.Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (sport)**: T is in the correct position (5). S is in the word but not in position 1. R is in the word but not in position 4. P and O are absent.

### Key Deductions:
- **Fixed Position**: Position 5 is T.
- **Confirmed Present Letters**: R, S, T (T is fixed at position 5).
- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, P, O.
- **Position Constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 (from guess 1) or 4 (from guess 2), so possible positions are 1 or 3.
- **Position Constraints for S**: Cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2), so possible positions are 2, 3, or 4.
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word must be _ _ _ _ T, containing R and S, avoiding absent letters.

### Strategy for Third Guess:
- Use a word ending in T to leverage the fixed position.
- Include R and S in new untested positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 1 for S).
- Test new common letters (e.g., consonants like B, F, or vowels I, U) for the remaining positions.
- Avoid repeating previous letters or using absent letters.

Chose ""first"" because:
- Ends with T (fixed), so position 5 is already correct.
- Places R at position 3 (untested and allowed position).
- Places S at position 4 (untested and allowed position).
- Tests new letters: F (position 1) and I (position 2).
- Avoids absent letters (C, A, N, E, P, O).

That\'s 5 new letters (all except R, which we know is present). And we are testing R at position 4.\n\nBut note: we are also testing S, P, O, T.\n\nIf we choose ""ROILS"", we test R at position 1, and O, I, L, S.\n\nI think both are good. Let me pick one.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SPORT"" because it has T, which is a very common letter.\n\nSo, second guess: SPORT\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. Yes, ""sport"" is a valid 5-letter word.\n\nSo, we\'ll guess ""SPORT"".\n\nBut note: the feedback for the first guess showed R in position 2 was wrong, but R is in the word. So in ""SPORT"", we put R at position 4. If the secret word has R at position 4, we\'ll get a check. If not, we\'ll get a minus or if it\'s not there at all? But we know R is in the word, so it must be either position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""SPORT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: x, R: -, A: x, N: x, E: x), we know:\n- The letter R is in the secret word but not in the second position.\n- The letters C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nFor the next guess, I need to:\n1. Avoid using C, A, N, or E.\n2. Include R in a position other than the second one (to test new locations).\n3.

The following letters are absent: C, A, N, E, P, O.\n\nWe also know the secret word must contain R and S, and we have T fixed at position 5.\n\nSince T is at position 5, and the word is 5 letters, we can represent the word as: _ _ _ _ T\n\nThe letters we have so far in the word: R, S, T (and the fixed T).\n\nBut note: we don\'t know the other letters yet.\n\nWe have used 2 guesses and have 4 left.\n\nFor the next guess, we need to:\n- Include R and S (since we know they are in the word).\n- Avoid the absent letters: C, A, N, E, P, O.\n- Make sure R is not in position 2 or 4 (but we can try other positions: 1, 3).\n- Make sure S is not in position 1 (so we can put it in positions 2, 3, or 4).\n\nAdditionally, we want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.\n\nCommon letters that haven\'t been tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word ending with T, and including R and S, without the forbidden letters.\n\nLet me consider words ending with T that have R and S and avoid C,A,N,E,P,O.\n\nSome ideas:\n\n- We can try placing S in position 2 and R in position 3? Example: ? S R ? T\n\nPossible words: \n  ""USURT"" - not a valid word.\n  ""VISIT"" - has I at position 2 and 4, but it ends with T. However, we need R. And ""visit"" doesn\'t have R.\n  Not working.\n\n- Place S in position 3 and R in position 1: R _ S _ T\n\nExample: ""TRUST"" - but T is already at position 5? Actually, ""TRUST"" has T at the end and S at the end? No: T-R-U-S-T -> positions: T (1), R (2), U (3), S (4), T (5). \nBut we have T at the end, so that\'s good. However, we have two T\'s? The feedback for ""sport"" showed T as correct at position 5, but we don\'t know if there is another T. But ""trust"" has T at the beginning and end. \nAlso, we have S at position 4. The word has R at position 2? But we know from guess 1 that R cannot be in position 2. So if we guess ""trust"", we would put R at position 2, which is forbidden because we know R is not in position 2.\n\nSo ""trust"" is invalid because R is in position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""FIRST"" - F-I-R-S-T. \nThis ends with T. R is at position 3 (which is acceptable, since we haven\'t tried position 3 for R). S is at position 4 (not 1, which is good). \nNow, check if the letters are allowed: F, I, R, S, T. \nAre any forbidden? We\'ve avoided C,A,N,E,P,O. Yes. \nSo ""first"" could be a candidate.\n\nBut let\'s see the pattern: F(1)-I(2)-R(3)-S(4)-T(5). \nWe know S cannot be in position 1 (which is fine here), and R cannot be in 2 or 4 (here R is in 3, so okay).\n\nThis guess tests F and I as new letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""WORST"" - W-O-R-S-T ... but O is in the word? We know O is absent (from guess 2). So we cannot use ""worst"" because it has O.\n\nAnother: ""BURST"" - B-U-R-S-T. Ends with T, R in position 3, S in position 4. Letters: B, U, R, S, T. None are forbidden (C,A,N,E,P,O are out). So ""burst"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""GIRST"" ... is girst a word? Not really. ""GRIFT"" doesn\'t have S. ""FIRST"" and ""BURST"" are good.\n\nAnother: ""SHIRT"" - S-H-I-R-T. This ends with T? S-H-I-R-T -> positions: S(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), T(5). But wait, T is at the end, good. But S is at position 1? The feedback from guess 2 told us that S is present but not in position 1. So if we put S in position 1, it would be wrong? Meaning if S were in position 1, it would have been marked accordingly. Since it was marked as absent in position 1 (but present elsewhere) we must avoid position 1 for S.\n\nIn ""shirt"", S is at position 1, which we must avoid because we know S is not in position 1.\n\nSo we cannot guess words with S at position 1.\n\nTherefore, ""shirt"" is invalid for that reason.\n\nSimilarly, ""START"" - S at 1? And T at 5, but S at 1 is forbidden. Also, A is absent, so invalid anyway.\n\nSo back to ""first"" and ""burst"".\n\nWe can also consider: ""DRIFT"" - ends with T? D-R-I-F-T -> positions: D(1), R(2), I(3), F(4), T(5). But R is at position 2? We know R is not in position 2 (from guess 1). So ""drift"" has R at 2, which is invalid.\n\nAnother: ""GRITS"" ... but doesn\'t end with T? ""GRIT"" is 4 letters. Not 5.\n\n""WREST"" - W-R-E-S-T ... but E is absent (from guess 1) and R is at position 2. So invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""MURST"" ... not a word.\n\n""BLAST"" ... but A is absent and S at position 2? But A is absent and we have S? Also, it ends with T? B-L-A-S-T -> but A is absent, so invalid.\n\nSo ""first"" and ""burst"" seem good.\n\nWe can also try ""DUSTY"" ... but doesn\'t have R? We must have R in the word.\n\nSo we need R and S.\n\nAnother candidate: ""FRISE"" ... but E is absent? And it doesn\'t end with T? No.\n\nWhat about ""TRYST"" ... T-R-Y-S-T ... but T is at the beginning and end? And R is at position 2? Which is forbidden. Also, we don\'t know if duplicate letters are allowed? But we already have T at the end, and if we guess T at position 1, it might be marked differently? But ""TRYST"" has two T\'s? And R at position 2 is not allowed.\n\nSo ""first"" and ""burst"" are the top candidates.\n\nNow, between ""first"" and ""burst"", which one gives more information?\n\nBoth have R at position 3 and S at position 4. So the pattern: _ _ R S T\n\nThe only difference is the first and second letters: for ""first"" we test F and I, for ""burst"" we test B and U.\n\nBoth F and B are common consonants, while I and U are vowels. We haven\'t tested any vowels except A,E,O (which are absent), so we have I and U as possibilities. Since we know that at least two vowels? Not necessarily, but words usually have vowels.\n\nAnother candidate: ""WORST"" ... but O is absent.\n\nAnother: ""JIRST"" ... not a word.\n\n""FIRST"" is a common word, and ""BURST"" is also common.\n\nWe can also consider ""CURST"" ... but C is absent? And it is not common.\n\nI think ""first"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: In the feedback from guess 2, S was at position 1 and marked as present but wrong position. Now, in ""first"", we put S at position 4. Similarly, R was at position 4 and now at position 3.\n\nThis might help us determine the position of R and S.\n\nMoreover, by placing R at position 3 and S at position 4, we avoid the incorrect positions we tried before.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""first"".\n\nBut wait, what about ""burst""? Is it better? Both are similar.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that puts R in a new position. We have tried R in position 2 and 4, so now in position 3. We haven\'t tried position 1 or 5? But position 5 is T, so R cannot be at 5. Position 1 is still possible? We haven\'t tried position 1 for R.\n\nBut in ""first"", R is at position 3, not 1.\n\nWhat if R is at position 1? Then we should try a word with R at the beginning.\n\nFor example: R ? ? ? T\n\nAnd must include S, and avoid C,A,N,E,P,O.\n\nAnd S cannot be in position 1? Position 1 is R, so S can be in 2,3,4.\n\nExample words:\n\n- ""RUSTY"" ... but no T at the end? It ends with Y. And we need T at the end? Our fixed T at the end? ""RUSTY"" ends with Y, not T.\n\n- ""RULER"" ... doesn\'t end with T.\n\n- ""RIFTS"" - R-I-F-T-S ... ends with S, not T.\n\n- ""RAFTS"" ... A is absent.\n\n- ""RANTS"" ... N absent.\n\n- ""RESTS"" ... E absent.\n\n- ""RISKS"" ... ends with S, not T.\n\n- ""ROOTS"" ... O absent.\n\nIt seems hard to find a word starting with R, ending with T, having S, and avoiding the forbidden letters.\n\nMaybe ""RYOTS"" ... is it a word? ryot: a peasant, but plural ryots? Not standard.\n\n""ROSTS"" ... not a word.\n\n""RUSTS"" ... ends with S, not T.\n\nSo perhaps it is difficult? Maybe R is not in position 1? We don\'t know, but later we can test.\n\nWe have ""first"" and ""burst"", which are good.\n\nAnother word: ""MERIT"" ... but E is absent? and it doesn\'t have S? and ends with T? M-E-R-I-T -> E is absent, so invalid.\n\nWe can also consider ""GUEST"" ... E absent? and it doesn\'t have R.\n\nNo.\n\nPerhaps ""BRUST"" ... not a word? Burst is the word, but we already considered ""burst"".\n\nSo between ""first"" and ""burst"", I\'ll choose ""first"" because F and I are common.\n\nBut note: in ""first"", we are testing:\n\n- Position 1: F\n- Position 2: I\n- Position 3: R\n- Position 4: S\n- Position 5: T (fixed, already correct)\n\nWe know position 5 is correct and fixed. We are trying to find the first four.\n\nThe feedback will tell us:\n- If F is in the word and in the correct position? \n- If I is in the word? \nAnd confirm R at position 3? And S at position 4? But they might not be correct if the word doesn\'t have R at 3 or S at 4.\n\nSince we suspect R at position 3? But we don\'t know.\n\nI think ""first"" is a solid guess.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""first"".\n\nBut wait, we have another idea: what about ""TRYST""? We rejected because R is at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother: ""DISTR"" ... doesn\'t end with T? No.\n\nSo I think ""first"" is fine.\n\nBut let me check: we are not forced to have the T at the end? But we know T is at the end, so yes, we must include T at position 5.\n\nTherefore, we can generate words ending with T and containing R and S.\n\nWord list: first, burst, worst (invalid due to O), wrist, grist, mistr (no).\n\n""wrist"" - W-R-I-S-T: ends with T? W-R-I-S-T -> positions: W(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), T(5). But R is at position 2! Which we know is incorrect (R cannot be at position 2). So ""wrist"" is invalid.\n\n""grist"" - G-R-I-S-T: R at position 2? Same problem.\n\n""frits"" - F-R-I-T-S ... but ends with S, not T? and T at position 4? Not ending with T.\n\nSo indeed, ""first"" and ""burst"" are among the few.\n\nWe can also consider ""LISTR"" ... not a word.\n\n""SHIRT"" - already considered and S at position 1 not allowed.\n\nAnother word: ""HIRST"" - meaning a hill, but uncommon? It ends with T? H-I-R-S-T? Positions: H(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). So same as ""first"". H, I, R, S, T. Only first letter different? And H and F are both possible.\n\nBut ""hirst"" is a valid word? I think so, but obscure.\n\nSimilarly, ""first"" is more common and thus a better choice.\n\nTherefore, we\'ll guess ""first"".\n\nIn summary, our reasoning:\n\n- T is fixed at position 5.\n- R must be in a position other than 2 or 4: so positions 1, 3.\n- S must be in a position other than 1: so positions 2, 3, 4.\n- Avoid letters: C, A, N, E, P, O.\n- Include R and S.\n\n""first"" has R at position 3 (allowed), S at position 4 (allowed), avoids bad letters, and tests F and I.\n\nSo we\'ll go with that.Based on the previous feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: R is in the word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (sport)**: T is in the correct position (5). S is in the word but not in position 1. R is in the word but not in position 4. P and O are absent.\n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Fixed Position**: Position 5 is T.\n- **Confirmed Present Letters**: R, S, T (T is fixed at position 5).\n- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, P, O.\n- **Position Constraints for R**: Cannot be in position 2 (from guess 1) or 4 (from guess 2), so possible positions are 1 or 3.\n- **Position Constraints for S**: Cannot be in position 1 (from guess 2), so possible positions are 2, 3, or 4.\n- **Word Pattern**: The secret word must be _ _ _ _ T, containing R and S, avoiding absent letters.\n\n### Strategy for Third Guess:\n- Use a word ending in T to leverage the fixed position.\n- Include R and S in new untested positions (avoiding position 2 for R and position 1 for S).\n- Test new common letters (e.g., consonants like B, F, or vowels I, U) for the remaining positions.\n- Avoid repeating previous letters or using absent letters.\n\nChose ""first"" because:\n- Ends with T (fixed), so position 5 is already correct.\n- Places R at position 3 (untested and allowed position).\n- Places S at position 4 (untested and allowed position).\n- Tests new letters: F (position 1) and I (position 2).\n- Avoids absent letters (C, A, N, E, P, O).\n\n<guess>first</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(-) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(✓)\nGuess 3: first -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(x) R(✓) S(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from Guess 3: ""first"" -> F(x) I(x) R(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
This means:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). 
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). (We already knew from Guess 2)
- F is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ R S T
Positions:
Position 1: unknown letter
Position 2: unknown letter
Position 3: R
Position 4: S
Position 5: T

And we know from previous guesses that the absent letters are: C, A, N, E, P, O, F, I.

We must find a word that fits: _ _ R S T

We have already used three guesses and have three left.

Now, we know:
- Position 1: Cannot be C, A, N, E, P, O, F, I. So possible letters include: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others not excluded).
- Position 2: Similarly, cannot be any absent letters: C, A, N, E, P, O, F, I. So same set as above.

But we also have constraints from previous feedback:

In Guess 1: ""crane"" had R in position 2 marked as present but wrong position. But now we know R is in position 3, so that feedback about R (in guess 1) being present is satisfied by position 3. However, note that since R is now fixed at position 3, that does not give us additional constraints for position 2 directly, but the letter in position 2 must not be R? Not necessarily: the word could have multiple R's? But we haven't seen any duplicate so far, and the feedback doesn't prevent duplicates.

But let me check: in guess 1, if there were an R in position 2? But we got a minus for R at position 2. Now, if the word has R at position 3, and possibly another R? For example, if there was another R in the word, but we haven't been told that.

From guess 1: R was marked as present but wrong position? It could be that the word has R at position 3, and no other R? Then the minus was because position 2 was wrong but position 3 was correct? However, in guess 1, we didn't have R at position 3, we had R at position 2 and got a minus, meaning that R is present but not at position 2. That doesn't conflict with having R at position 3, which is now known.

Similarly, in guess 2: ""sport"" had R at position 4 and got a minus, meaning R is not at position 4. This is consistent because R is at position 3.

So for position 2, we currently have no constraint that it cannot be R? But if it were R, then in guess 1, since R was at position 2 and marked minus, but if the word had two R's, one at position 3 and one at position 2? Then in guess 1, R in position 2 would be marked as minus? Actually, it could be marked as minus because the R at position 2 is not correct? But if the word has two R's, then guessing an R at position 2 might get a minus if that position is wrong, even if there is a different R elsewhere.

But in this case, now we know that position 3 is R, so position 2 cannot be R? Because if it were R, then in guess 3, ""first"" has R at position 3 and we have a check, but if position 2 were also R, we wouldn't know? Actually, no: in guess 3, we only have one R? We guessed only one R. So if the word had two R's, and we guessed one R at the correct spot and one not, then we would see: for position 2 in ""first"" we had I, which was marked as absent. So if position 2 were R, then we would have guessed a wrong letter? But the word would have R at position 2, and we guessed I, so that would be marked as wrong? Unless there was a different letter? Actually, no: if the secret word had R at position 2, then in guess 3 ""first"", which has I at position 2, we would get a minus for the letter? But what? We got I(x) meaning I is absent, but if R were there, we would get a different marking for position 2? Let me think:

The marking is based on what the secret word has. At position 2: in ""first"" we guessed I. If the secret word has R at position 2, then I is not present? So we would still get x for I? And the R at position 2 would not be reflected because we didn't guess it? So it wouldn't affect the feedback for position 2? Thus, we don't know if position 2 is R or not? But after guess 1: when we guessed ""crane"" with R at position 2, we got minus for R. Meaning: the letter R is present but not at position 2. Therefore, if the secret word had an R at position 2, it should have been marked as ✓ since it is present and correct? But it was not; it was marked as minus, meaning R is present but not at that position. Therefore, position 2 cannot be R.

Similarly, from guess 1: if position 2 were R, then guessing ""crane"" should have gotten a ✓ at position 2 for R. Instead, it got a minus, meaning R is not at position 2.

So position 2 is not R.

Moreover, position 4 is S? And we know from guess 2 that position 4 was R? But no, in guess 2 we guessed R at position 4? And we got minus, meaning R is not at position 4? And now we know position 4 is S, so it cannot be R? Yes, it must be S? And we have a check? So position 4 is S.

Similarly, position 3 is R? and position 5 is T.

So we know:
Position1: unknown (letter X)
Position2: unknown (letter Y)
Position3: R
Position4: S
Position5: T

Therefore, the secret word is X Y R S T

And we know X and Y are letters that:
- Are not any of the absent letters: C, A, N, E, P, O, F, I.
- And the word is a valid English word.

We must find X and Y from the remaining letters: that is, letters that haven't been excluded.

The excluded letters so far: C, A, N, E, P, O, F, I.

So possible letters for X and Y: any letter except these. Specifically, among common vowels and consonants.

Common vowels we haven't tried: U and sometimes Y? Since A, E, I, O are out? Vowels: A, E, I, O, U? We have U and Y? Also, consonants: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, Q, R? But R is already known at position 3? So if we put R at position 2? But wait, position 2 cannot be R? As argued earlier? Yes.

Similarly, S and T are present? But S is at position 4 and T at position 5? And we haven't excluded duplicates? But let's see: if there were a duplicate, it might be possible? But we have to form a valid word.

Possible words: 
We need a 5-letter word ending in RST? Common suffixes? 

Words ending in RST: burst, wurst, durst, etc.

List:
- burst: B U R S T -> so X=B, Y=U. Both B and U are not excluded? Yes, since excluded are C,A,N,E,P,O,F,I. So B and U are okay.
- wurst: W U R S T -> valid word? Yes? German for sausage? Acceptable? But we haven't used W. And U? Same as above? W and U are okay.
- durst: D U R S T? Is that a word? Durst means thirst, often archaic? But it might be acceptable.
- worst: W O R S T -> but O is excluded? So invalid? O is absent.
- first: we guessed, but F and I are absent? So invalid.
- hurst: H U R S T -> like in forest? Hurst is a word? Meaning a hill? So H and U? Okay.
- thirst: T H I R S T? Ends in ST? T-H-I-R-S-T. Positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), S(5) -> doesn't fit our pattern? We need R at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5? But thirst has I at position 3? Which we know is absent? And also S at position 5, not 4? Doesn't fit.

So words that fit: burst, wurst, durst, hurst, etc.

But also: 
""burst"" is one possibility? But let me check: 
B U R S T -> positions: B(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). Fits.

Similarly, ""wurst"": W U R S T -> W(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). Fits.

""durst"": D U R S T -> same pattern with D and U.

""hurst"": H U R S T -> H and U.

Are there others? ""curst"" has C? C is excluded? C not allowed.

""merst"" ... not a word.

""yerst"" ... archaic? Not common.

So mainly: burst, wurst, durst, hurst.

We have not tried B, U, W, D, H? So we don't know if any of these are present.

We need to guess a word that fits this pattern and includes possible letters? But we have two unknowns at positions 1 and 2? And we have three remaining guesses? We can guess one of these possible words.

Since ""burst"" is a common word, and we haven't tried B and U before? We should guess that? Or we can try a word that uses more new letters? But we have to fit the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily fill the pattern? But wait, we know the last three letters: RST are fixed? So the word must be ? ? R S T.

Therefore, any valid guess must end with ""R S T""? And be 5 letters? So we must guess a word of the form X Y R S T.

We have to choose X and Y such that the word is valid? And test whether B U is the combination? Or W U? Or D U? Or H U? Etc.

So we should guess one of these? Since we have three guesses, we can start with a common one? Like ""burst""?

But note: in our previous guess, we guessed ""first"", which had I and F? Now we know F and I are absent? So burst uses B and U, which are new.

Similarly, wurst uses W and U? Etc.

What about ""yurst"" ... not a word.

So we have to choose among burst, wurst, durst, hurst? And others? Like maybe ""gurst""? Not a word.

Another common one: ""burst"" is the most common.

But also, we can consider ""herst""? Meaning to harrow? Obscure? Not preferable.

""burst"" seems the best and common.

But let me see: we haven't tested B, U, etc.? So guessing ""burst"" directly might solve it? If it's correct? Or give us feedback if it's not.

If we guess ""burst"" and it's correct? We'll win? If not, the feedback will tell us what's wrong? For example, if B or U is missing? But because of the pattern, the only variables are positions 1 and 2? So if we guess ""burst"" and it's not the word, we will still get the feedback on B and U? Specifically:

If we guess ""burst"": B U R S T?
Feedback:
- At position 1: B... if B is in the word and correct? Or not?
- Similarly, U at position 2? 

But since we know the positions of R, S, T? The first two letters can only get:
Either:
- ✓ for B: meaning B is correct at position 1? 
- ✓ for U: meaning correct at position 2? 
Or if not:
- If B is in the word but wrong position? But position 1 might be wrong? Then a minus? But possible? For example, if the word were ""wurst"", then B would be absent? And U at position 2? But if ""burst"" is incorrect, then either B is absent? Or U? Or both? 

After guessing ""burst"", if we get:
- B: either ✓, -, or x?
- Similarly for U? 

But note: since the word must have only two variables? And we don't know what X and Y are? The possibilities are limited? So guessing any one of these words will either be correct or give us the exact positions? 

Alternatively, we could try to get more information? But with three guesses and only two positions? We can afford? But it might be efficient? 

But note: if we guess a word that isn't one of the candidates? For example, guess a word that has different letters? But the word must end with RST? Otherwise? No? The word is fixed to end with RST? Because positions 3,4,5 are fixed? Thus, any guess we make must be of the form X Y R S T? Otherwise, we are not respecting the fixed positions? We can guess differently? But we know R,S,T are fixed? So in a guess, if we don't put R at position 3, it will be marked as absent? Similarly for S and T? So to avoid wasting? We should put R at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5? And guess for positions 1 and 2? 

Therefore, our next guess must be of the form X Y R S T? Where X and Y are letters not excluded? And we must choose X and Y such that X Y R S T is a valid word? Then we get feedback specifically on X and Y? 

Therefore, we can guess ""burst""? For example? 

But let's think: we could guess a word that uses letters we haven't tried? For the first two positions? Which is necessary? 

So among the candidates, ""burst"" uses B and U? Which are new? Similarly, ""wurst"" uses W and U? Etc. 

A word like ""burst"" will use letters B and U? Both which haven't been tested? So we can get information? 

If we guess ""burst"":
- If X=B and Y=U, then burst is the word? We? re done?
- Else, we get feedback: 
  - Position 1: B -> if B is absent? Then X is not B? Or if B is present but not at position 1? Then a minus? But what other position? Position 1 is open? Positions 2 is also open? But the word might have duplicate letters? But if B is present in the word but not at position 1? Then it should appear elsewhere? But positions 2 must be Y, which is a letter? Similarly? 
  - Position 2: U? 

After guessing ""burst"", if it's incorrect, we will know:
- B at position 1: 
   - If B is correct? Then X=B? But not? Since we guessed
   - If B is in the word? But wrong position? Then a minus? Meaning B is somewhere else? But the only other positions are position 2? But position 2 is U? And we guessed U? So if B is at position 2? Then we guessed U at position 2? Which might be wrong? 
- Similarly for U? 

But since the word must be X Y R S T? If B is absent? Then we know X is not B? If B is in the word but not at position 1? Then B is at position 2? But position 2 is U? So then U must be not? If B is at position 2? Then Y=B? And we guessed U at position 2? So that would be wrong? So U must be absent? Or vice versa? 

It might be messy? But we can deduce? 

Since we have three guesses? We can guess ""burst"" first? 

But to cover more possibilities? Or use a guess that tests multiple candidates? But not possible because we have to commit to one X and Y? 

Alternatively, guess a word that doesn't end in RST? But that would be inefficient? Because we know three positions are fixed? 

For example, if I guess ""dusty""? That doesn't end with T? We know position 5 is T? So ""dusty"" ends with Y? Not T? So that will get feedback that T is at position 5? Which we already know? And D U S T Y? But S is at position 3? Not position 4? Etc? 

This would then give:
- S might be marked correctly or not? Whereas in our case, S should be at position 4? 

This would be a bad idea? Because we know positions 3,4,5 are R,S,T respectively? And must be in the word? 

Therefore, to respect the fixed positions, we must guess a word that has R at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5? So only the first two letters change? 

So we must guess one of: burst, wurst, durst, hurst, etc.

""burst"" is the most common? So let's guess that? 

If it's not correct, the feedback will tell us if B and/or U are in the word? And their positions? Then we can guess accordingly.

For example, if after guessing ""burst"", we get B: x and U: x? Then we know both B and U are absent? Then we try ""wurst"" next? Etc.

But note? We might also have other words like ""kjars""? Not valid? Or ""myrrh""? Not.

Another: ""byrst"" ... not valid.

So let's go with ""burst"".

Therefore, fourth guess: burst

In summary: the secret word must be _ _ R S T. We'll guess burst to test B and U for positions 1 and 2.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Current Feedback Summary:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x) → R is present but not in position 2; C, A, N, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (sport)**: S(-), P(x), O(x), R(-), T(✓) → S is present (but not pos. 1); R is present (but not pos. 4); T is correct at position 5; P and O are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (first)**: F(x), I(x), R(✓), S(✓), T(✓) → R, S, and T are correct at positions 3, 4, and 5; F and I are absent.

2. **Deductions from Feedback:**
   - Positions 3, 4, and 5 are **fixed**: 
     - Position 3: R
     - Position 4: S
     - Position 5: T
     - Secret word pattern: `_ _ R S T`
   - **Confirmed absent letters**: C, A, N, E, P, O, F, I (they cannot appear anywhere).
   - **Remaining unknown**: Positions 1 and 2 must be filled with letters not in the absent set. Possible candidates include B, D, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.
   - **Additional constraints**: 
     - Position 2 cannot be R (from Guess 1, R was marked ""-"" in position 2, which conflicts with the now-fixed position 3 R). Duplicate letters are possible but unlikely based on feedback so far.

3. **Possible Vocabulary**: Words matching `_ _ R S T`:
   - **burst** (B, U)
   - **wurst** (W, U)
   - **hurst** (H, U)
   - **durst** (D, U)  
   (Common words like ""first"" or ""worst"" are invalid due to absent letters like F, I, O).

4. **Strategy for This Guess**:
   - Need to test positions 1 and 2 efficiently with letters not yet ruled out.
   - **burst** is prioritized because:
     - Tests **B** (common consonant) and **U** (untested vowel) in positions 1 and 2.
     - Avoids all conflicted positions and absent letters.
     - If correct, it solves the puzzle; if incorrect, feedback on B/U will reveal which of the candidate words is correct.
   - Alternatives like ""wurst"" or ""durst"" are less common but will be considered if ""burst"" is wrong.

5. **Optimization**:  
   With only 3 guesses left and few valid word options, guessing ""burst"" maximizes information gain or solves the game.

<guess>burst</guess>",burst,"We are given feedback from Guess 3: ""first"" -> F(x) I(x) R(✓) S(✓) T(✓)
This means:
- R is in the word and in the correct position (position 3). 
- S is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- T is in the word and in the correct position (position 5). (We already knew from Guess 2)
- F is not in the word.
- I is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ R S T
Positions:
Position 1: unknown letter
Position 2: unknown letter
Position 3: R
Position 4: S
Position 5: T

And we know from previous guesses that the absent letters are: C, A, N, E, P, O, F, I.

We must find a word that fits: _ _ R S T

We have already used three guesses and have three left.

Now, we know:
- Position 1: Cannot be C, A, N, E, P, O, F, I. So possible letters include: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and possibly others not excluded).
- Position 2: Similarly, cannot be any absent letters: C, A, N, E, P, O, F, I. So same set as above.

But we also have constraints from previous feedback:

In Guess 1: ""crane"" had R in position 2 marked as present but wrong position. But now we know R is in position 3, so that feedback about R (in guess 1) being present is satisfied by position 3. However, note that since R is now fixed at position 3, that does not give us additional constraints for position 2 directly, but the letter in position 2 must not be R? Not necessarily: the word could have multiple R's? But we haven't seen any duplicate so far, and the feedback doesn't prevent duplicates.

But let me check: in guess 1, if there were an R in position 2? But we got a minus for R at position 2. Now, if the word has R at position 3, and possibly another R? For example, if there was another R in the word, but we haven't been told that.

From guess 1: R was marked as present but wrong position? It could be that the word has R at position 3, and no other R? Then the minus was because position 2 was wrong but position 3 was correct? However, in guess 1, we didn't have R at position 3, we had R at position 2 and got a minus, meaning that R is present but not at position 2. That doesn't conflict with having R at position 3, which is now known.

Similarly, in guess 2: ""sport"" had R at position 4 and got a minus, meaning R is not at position 4. This is consistent because R is at position 3.

So for position 2, we currently have no constraint that it cannot be R? But if it were R, then in guess 1, since R was at position 2 and marked minus, but if the word had two R's, one at position 3 and one at position 2? Then in guess 1, R in position 2 would be marked as minus? Actually, it could be marked as minus because the R at position 2 is not correct? But if the word has two R's, then guessing an R at position 2 might get a minus if that position is wrong, even if there is a different R elsewhere.

But in this case, now we know that position 3 is R, so position 2 cannot be R? Because if it were R, then in guess 3, ""first"" has R at position 3 and we have a check, but if position 2 were also R, we wouldn't know? Actually, no: in guess 3, we only have one R? We guessed only one R. So if the word had two R's, and we guessed one R at the correct spot and one not, then we would see: for position 2 in ""first"" we had I, which was marked as absent. So if position 2 were R, then we would have guessed a wrong letter? But the word would have R at position 2, and we guessed I, so that would be marked as wrong? Unless there was a different letter? Actually, no: if the secret word had R at position 2, then in guess 3 ""first"", which has I at position 2, we would get a minus for the letter? But what? We got I(x) meaning I is absent, but if R were there, we would get a different marking for position 2? Let me think:

The marking is based on what the secret word has. At position 2: in ""first"" we guessed I. If the secret word has R at position 2, then I is not present? So we would still get x for I? And the R at position 2 would not be reflected because we didn't guess it? So it wouldn't affect the feedback for position 2? Thus, we don't know if position 2 is R or not? But after guess 1: when we guessed ""crane"" with R at position 2, we got minus for R. Meaning: the letter R is present but not at position 2. Therefore, if the secret word had an R at position 2, it should have been marked as ✓ since it is present and correct? But it was not; it was marked as minus, meaning R is present but not at that position. Therefore, position 2 cannot be R.

Similarly, from guess 1: if position 2 were R, then guessing ""crane"" should have gotten a ✓ at position 2 for R. Instead, it got a minus, meaning R is not at position 2.

So position 2 is not R.

Moreover, position 4 is S? And we know from guess 2 that position 4 was R? But no, in guess 2 we guessed R at position 4? And we got minus, meaning R is not at position 4? And now we know position 4 is S, so it cannot be R? Yes, it must be S? And we have a check? So position 4 is S.

Similarly, position 3 is R? and position 5 is T.

So we know:
Position1: unknown (letter X)
Position2: unknown (letter Y)
Position3: R
Position4: S
Position5: T

Therefore, the secret word is X Y R S T

And we know X and Y are letters that:
- Are not any of the absent letters: C, A, N, E, P, O, F, I.
- And the word is a valid English word.

We must find X and Y from the remaining letters: that is, letters that haven't been excluded.

The excluded letters so far: C, A, N, E, P, O, F, I.

So possible letters for X and Y: any letter except these. Specifically, among common vowels and consonants.

Common vowels we haven't tried: U and sometimes Y? Since A, E, I, O are out? Vowels: A, E, I, O, U? We have U and Y? Also, consonants: B, D, G, H, K, L, M, Q, R? But R is already known at position 3? So if we put R at position 2? But wait, position 2 cannot be R? As argued earlier? Yes.

Similarly, S and T are present? But S is at position 4 and T at position 5? And we haven't excluded duplicates? But let's see: if there were a duplicate, it might be possible? But we have to form a valid word.

Possible words: 
We need a 5-letter word ending in RST? Common suffixes? 

Words ending in RST: burst, wurst, durst, etc.

List:
- burst: B U R S T -> so X=B, Y=U. Both B and U are not excluded? Yes, since excluded are C,A,N,E,P,O,F,I. So B and U are okay.
- wurst: W U R S T -> valid word? Yes? German for sausage? Acceptable? But we haven't used W. And U? Same as above? W and U are okay.
- durst: D U R S T? Is that a word? Durst means thirst, often archaic? But it might be acceptable.
- worst: W O R S T -> but O is excluded? So invalid? O is absent.
- first: we guessed, but F and I are absent? So invalid.
- hurst: H U R S T -> like in forest? Hurst is a word? Meaning a hill? So H and U? Okay.
- thirst: T H I R S T? Ends in ST? T-H-I-R-S-T. Positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), R(4), S(5) -> doesn't fit our pattern? We need R at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5? But thirst has I at position 3? Which we know is absent? And also S at position 5, not 4? Doesn't fit.

So words that fit: burst, wurst, durst, hurst, etc.

But also: 
""burst"" is one possibility? But let me check: 
B U R S T -> positions: B(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). Fits.

Similarly, ""wurst"": W U R S T -> W(1), U(2), R(3), S(4), T(5). Fits.

""durst"": D U R S T -> same pattern with D and U.

""hurst"": H U R S T -> H and U.

Are there others? ""curst"" has C? C is excluded? C not allowed.

""merst"" ... not a word.

""yerst"" ... archaic? Not common.

So mainly: burst, wurst, durst, hurst.

We have not tried B, U, W, D, H? So we don't know if any of these are present.

We need to guess a word that fits this pattern and includes possible letters? But we have two unknowns at positions 1 and 2? And we have three remaining guesses? We can guess one of these possible words.

Since ""burst"" is a common word, and we haven't tried B and U before? We should guess that? Or we can try a word that uses more new letters? But we have to fit the pattern.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't necessarily fill the pattern? But wait, we know the last three letters: RST are fixed? So the word must be ? ? R S T.

Therefore, any valid guess must end with ""R S T""? And be 5 letters? So we must guess a word of the form X Y R S T.

We have to choose X and Y such that the word is valid? And test whether B U is the combination? Or W U? Or D U? Or H U? Etc.

So we should guess one of these? Since we have three guesses, we can start with a common one? Like ""burst""?

But note: in our previous guess, we guessed ""first"", which had I and F? Now we know F and I are absent? So burst uses B and U, which are new.

Similarly, wurst uses W and U? Etc.

What about ""yurst"" ... not a word.

So we have to choose among burst, wurst, durst, hurst? And others? Like maybe ""gurst""? Not a word.

Another common one: ""burst"" is the most common.

But also, we can consider ""herst""? Meaning to harrow? Obscure? Not preferable.

""burst"" seems the best and common.

But let me see: we haven't tested B, U, etc.? So guessing ""burst"" directly might solve it? If it's correct? Or give us feedback if it's not.

If we guess ""burst"" and it's correct? We'll win? If not, the feedback will tell us what's wrong? For example, if B or U is missing? But because of the pattern, the only variables are positions 1 and 2? So if we guess ""burst"" and it's not the word, we will still get the feedback on B and U? Specifically:

If we guess ""burst"": B U R S T?
Feedback:
- At position 1: B... if B is in the word and correct? Or not?
- Similarly, U at position 2? 

But since we know the positions of R, S, T? The first two letters can only get:
Either:
- ✓ for B: meaning B is correct at position 1? 
- ✓ for U: meaning correct at position 2? 
Or if not:
- If B is in the word but wrong position? But position 1 might be wrong? Then a minus? But possible? For example, if the word were ""wurst"", then B would be absent? And U at position 2? But if ""burst"" is incorrect, then either B is absent? Or U? Or both? 

After guessing ""burst"", if we get:
- B: either ✓, -, or x?
- Similarly for U? 

But note: since the word must have only two variables? And we don't know what X and Y are? The possibilities are limited? So guessing any one of these words will either be correct or give us the exact positions? 

Alternatively, we could try to get more information? But with three guesses and only two positions? We can afford? But it might be efficient? 

But note: if we guess a word that isn't one of the candidates? For example, guess a word that has different letters? But the word must end with RST? Otherwise? No? The word is fixed to end with RST? Because positions 3,4,5 are fixed? Thus, any guess we make must be of the form X Y R S T? Otherwise, we are not respecting the fixed positions? We can guess differently? But we know R,S,T are fixed? So in a guess, if we don't put R at position 3, it will be marked as absent? Similarly for S and T? So to avoid wasting? We should put R at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5? And guess for positions 1 and 2? 

Therefore, our next guess must be of the form X Y R S T? Where X and Y are letters not excluded? And we must choose X and Y such that X Y R S T is a valid word? Then we get feedback specifically on X and Y? 

Therefore, we can guess ""burst""? For example? 

But let's think: we could guess a word that uses letters we haven't tried? For the first two positions? Which is necessary? 

So among the candidates, ""burst"" uses B and U? Which are new? Similarly, ""wurst"" uses W and U? Etc. 

A word like ""burst"" will use letters B and U? Both which haven't been tested? So we can get information? 

If we guess ""burst"":
- If X=B and Y=U, then burst is the word? We? re done?
- Else, we get feedback: 
  - Position 1: B -> if B is absent? Then X is not B? Or if B is present but not at position 1? Then a minus? But what other position? Position 1 is open? Positions 2 is also open? But the word might have duplicate letters? But if B is present in the word but not at position 1? Then it should appear elsewhere? But positions 2 must be Y, which is a letter? Similarly? 
  - Position 2: U? 

After guessing ""burst"", if it's incorrect, we will know:
- B at position 1: 
   - If B is correct? Then X=B? But not? Since we guessed
   - If B is in the word? But wrong position? Then a minus? Meaning B is somewhere else? But the only other positions are position 2? But position 2 is U? And we guessed U? So if B is at position 2? Then we guessed U at position 2? Which might be wrong? 
- Similarly for U? 

But since the word must be X Y R S T? If B is absent? Then we know X is not B? If B is in the word but not at position 1? Then B is at position 2? But position 2 is U? So then U must be not? If B is at position 2? Then Y=B? And we guessed U at position 2? So that would be wrong? So U must be absent? Or vice versa? 

It might be messy? But we can deduce? 

Since we have three guesses? We can guess ""burst"" first? 

But to cover more possibilities? Or use a guess that tests multiple candidates? But not possible because we have to commit to one X and Y? 

Alternatively, guess a word that doesn't end in RST? But that would be inefficient? Because we know three positions are fixed? 

For example, if I guess ""dusty""? That doesn't end with T? We know position 5 is T? So ""dusty"" ends with Y? Not T? So that will get feedback that T is at position 5? Which we already know? And D U S T Y? But S is at position 3? Not position 4? Etc? 

This would then give:
- S might be marked correctly or not? Whereas in our case, S should be at position 4? 

This would be a bad idea? Because we know positions 3,4,5 are R,S,T respectively? And must be in the word? 

Therefore, to respect the fixed positions, we must guess a word that has R at position 3, S at position 4, T at position 5? So only the first two letters change? 

So we must guess one of: burst, wurst, durst, hurst, etc.

""burst"" is the most common? So let's guess that? 

If it's not correct, the feedback will tell us if B and/or U are in the word? And their positions? Then we can guess accordingly.

For example, if after guessing ""burst"", we get B: x and U: x? Then we know both B and U are absent? Then we try ""wurst"" next? Etc.

But note? We might also have other words like ""kjars""? Not valid? Or ""myrrh""? Not.

Another: ""byrst"" ... not valid.

So let's go with ""burst"".

Therefore, fourth guess: burst
