Alright, the user is asking me to make the first guess in a Wordle-style game. Since it's the first turn, I have no prior feedback to work with - I need to choose an optimal starting word based on common strategy. 

Hmm, I recall that effective starter words should contain frequent English letters and maximize coverage of common positions. Vowels like A/E/O and consonants like R/S/T are statistically strong. 

Let me evaluate some candidate words: ""CRANE"" comes to mind - it covers C,R,A,N,E which include three vowels and two common consonants. Alternative options like ""SLATE"" or ""ROAST"" also seem good, but ""CRANE"" has more unique letters. 

Double-checking: C is often in first position, R and A frequently appear in middle spots, N and E are common endings. This distribution might yield useful positional feedback. Plus, no repeated letters - efficient for information gathering. 

Potential drawback: misses U/I/O and consonants like L/T, but no single word can cover everything. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for now - it's a popular choice among experienced players for maximizing initial data. 

User hasn't expressed preferences, so I'll stick with this neutral mathematical approach. They'll get concrete feedback to build upon next turn.

For the first guess, I need to select a word that maximizes the chances of getting useful feedback. The best approach is to choose a word with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starter because:
- It contains common letters: C, R, A, N, E
- It uses three vowels (A, E) and two frequent consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are unique, avoiding redundancy
- It covers positional diversity (C often starts words, E often ends words)
This choice should provide clear feedback to inform the next guess, regardless of whether letters are correct ✓, misplaced -, or absent x.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Therefore, we know:
- The 3rd letter is A.
- The 5th letter is E.
- C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Since A is in position 3 and E in position 5, the word pattern is: __ A __ E

We need to avoid using the letters C, R, and N.

For the second guess, we should try to include other common letters to test for the remaining positions.

Possible common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

We know the word has:
- Position 1: unknown (but not C, R)
- Position 2: unknown (but not C, R)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: unknown (but not C, R, and E is already at the end so it can't be E here? Wait, E is only at position 5, but it could appear again? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters but in this case, since we have two E's? Wait, note: we only know E is at the 5th position, but it might appear elsewhere? However, the feedback does not show duplicates unless present. Since we don't have any indication of duplicate, but it's possible.

But note: our first guess only had one E and it was correct at the end. If there were another E, we might have gotten an indication. However, in the standard rules, if a letter appears twice and we guess it twice, then if one is correct and the other is not, the second one might show as absent (if the word has only one E) or as misplaced (if there is a second E). But in this guess, we only have one E and it was correct. So the word has at least one E, but might have more? However, we don't know.

But the feedback didn't mark any other E because we didn't guess it elsewhere. So we have no information about duplicates.

Given the constraints:
- The word has at least A at position 3 and E at position 5.
- It does not contain C, R, N.

Let's think of words that end with E and have A in the third position.

Pattern: __ __ A __ E

Possible letters for the blanks: We have positions 1, 2, and 4 to fill.

We should pick a word that uses as many untested common letters as possible.

Common vowels and consonants remaining: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, H, B, etc.

I am considering words like:
- SALVE? But V is less common.
- SOARE? (a bird, not common) but let's stick to common words.

One good candidate is ""SHAME"": 
- S in position 1, H in position 2, A in 3, M in 4, E in 5? Pattern matches.

But we don't know if H or M are in the word. Also, S and M are common.

Another candidate: ""STALE"" but L and T? However, we have A in the 3rd which should be fixed? Wait, STALE has A in 2nd? No: STALE -> S T A L E -> A is in 3rd? Wait:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: A? Yes, so STALE has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th? 
But E is at 5th? S-T-A-L-E -> position 5 is E? Yes.

But we don't know if T and L are in the word? Also, we haven't tested S, T, L.

However, note feedback: we got E at 5th, so E is definitely at the end. But STALE has E at the 5th? Yes.

But wait: STALE has letters S,T,A,L,E. We know A is fixed at 3rd and E at 5th. We haven't eliminated T, S, L.

But note: our first guess had E at 5th, so STALE would also have E at 5th? Yes.

But also, our first guess showed that A is at 3rd, so STALE has A at 3? Yes because STALE: 
1: S, 2: T, 3: A, 4: L, 5: E -> so A is at 3, E at 5: perfect.

Now, we haven't tested S, T, L. And we know C, R, N are out.

But we are allowed to use T? Yes, because R is out, but T hasn't been tested? Correct.

However, we also got E at 5th, but in STALE, E is at 5th? Yes.

But let me check: our goal is to find what letters are in positions 1,2,4 and avoid known absent letters: C,R,N.

So STALE avoids C,R,N.

Alternatively, we could try ""SLATE"": 
- S L A T E -> A at 3, E at 5? 
- Position 1: S, 2: L, 3: A, 4: T, 5: E -> also fits.

SLATE is a common starting word too.

Both STALE and SLATE are good because they test multiple common letters.

But note: we have E at 5th and we know it's correct, so we don't need to test E again? Actually, we know E is correct at 5th, so any guess must have E at 5th? Not necessarily? Actually, no: the rules don't require that we reuse known correct letters? But if we don't put E at 5th, then if the word has E at 5th, our guess must have a letter at 5th that isn't E, so it would get an x? Which wastes one letter. So best to put E at 5th to lock that position since we know it's correct.

Similarly, we know A is at 3rd so we should put A at 3rd.

Therefore, our next guess must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.

So we are constrained to the pattern: __ __ A __ E

So for positions 1, 2, and 4, we pick letters that we haven't tried and that are common.

We haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, K, etc.

Avoid: C, R, N (since they are absent).

Now, I want to maximize the chance of getting more letters. So pick a word that uses three new letters that are common.

Possible words:

- **SOARE**: This is a word? (hawk) but uncommon? Might not be accepted. Avoid.

- **SLATE**: 
  - S, L, A, T, E -> letters: S, L, T (common) and avoids C,R,N.

- **STALE**: 
  - S, T, A, L, E -> same as SLATE, letters: S, T, L.

- **SHADE**: 
  - S, H, A, D, E -> also tests H and D.

- **SPADE**:
  - S, P, A, D, E -> tests P and D.

But we might prefer to get more feedback on more common letters? Like S and T.

Since we don't have any information about positions 1 and 2, and position 4, we can choose a word that uses S in position 1, T in position 2? Then position 4 we put another letter.

For example, ""STATE"" has two T's? And we don't know if there are duplicates? But STATE has A in the 3rd? STATE: S T A T E -> 
- Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). So A and E are in position 3 and 5? Yes.

But STATE has T at position 2 and 4. Since we got R absent, but T is new? And we haven't tested T? So okay? But let's see: the word might have T? Possibly.

But I think SLATE or STALE are better because they have distinct letters.

Let me consider:

- **SAUTE**: 
  - S A U T E -> Wait, A is at position 2? But we need A at position 3? So SAUTE: S-A-U-T-E -> Position 3 is U? Not A. So not valid.

So only words where the third letter is A and fifth is E.

Examples:

- BLAME: B L A M E -> good? but B is not very common? M is okay.
- FLAME: F L A M E -> but F might be less common.
- PLATE: P L A T E -> common letters: P, L, T.

PLATE might be a candidate: tests P, L, T.

But let's look for words with maybe more common letters? S and T are usually the most common.

So SLATE: S L A T E -> letters: S (common first letter), L (common), T (common).

Therefore, I'll go with SLATE because it uses common letters and doesn't duplicate any known ones.

Also, note: we haven't tested L, T, S? But we know they aren't in the absent list? Correct.

Therefore, for the next guess: SLATE

Feedback will tell us about S in position 1? Could be correct? Maybe misplaced? Or absent? Similarly L in 2? And T in 4? And we already know A and E are correct.

So let's output SLATE.

### Step-by-Step Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Previous Guess:** ""crane""
- **Feedback:** C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
- **Key Insights:**
  1. **Position 3 (A)** is confirmed correct (✓), so the secret word must have ""A"" in the third position.
  2. **Position 5 (E)** is confirmed correct (✓), so the secret word ends with ""E"".
  3. **Letters C, R, and N** are absent (x) from the word entirely and must be avoided in future guesses.
- **Pattern Deduction:** The secret word follows the pattern `__ __ A __ E`, where:
  - Positions 1, 2, and 4 are unknown.
  - Letters C, R, and N are excluded.
- **Strategy for Next Guess:**  
  - Focus on common English letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, D) to maximize information.
  - Prioritize words that:
    - Maintain ""A"" in position 3 and ""E"" in position 5 (to respect confirmed positions).
    - Avoid C, R, N (known absent letters).
    - Test new high-frequency consonants/vowels for positions 1, 2, and 4.
  - Strong candidate words include ""**SLATE**"" or ""**STALE**"" (both common and test S, T, L efficiently). ""SLATE"" is selected here as it covers:
    - S (common starting letter).
    - T and L (frequently used consonants).
    - Unique letters to avoid redundancy.

For example, ""STATE"" has two T's? And we don't know if there are duplicates? But STATE has A in the 3rd? STATE: S T A T E -> 
- Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). So A and E are in position 3 and 5? Yes.

But STATE has T at position 2 and 4. Since we got R absent, but T is new? And we haven't tested T? So okay? But let's see: the word might have T? Possibly.

But I think SLATE or STALE are better because they have distinct letters.

Let me consider:

- **SAUTE**: 
  - S A U T E -> Wait, A is at position 2? But we need A at position 3? So SAUTE: S-A-U-T-E -> Position 3 is U? Not A. So not valid.

So only words where the third letter is A and fifth is E.

Examples:

- BLAME: B L A M E -> good? but B is not very common? M is okay.
- FLAME: F L A M E -> but F might be less common.
- PLATE: P L A T E -> common letters: P, L, T.

PLATE might be a candidate: tests P, L, T.

But let's look for words with maybe more common letters? S and T are usually the most common.

So SLATE: S L A T E -> letters: S (common first letter), L (common), T (common).

Therefore, I'll go with SLATE because it uses common letters and doesn't duplicate any known ones.

Also, note: we haven't tested L, T, S? But we know they aren't in the absent list? Correct.

Therefore, for the next guess: SLATE

Feedback will tell us about S in position 1? Could be correct? Maybe misplaced? Or absent? Similarly L in 2? And T in 4? And we already know A and E are correct.

So let's output SLATE.### Step-by-Step Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Previous Guess:** ""crane""
- **Feedback:** C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
- **Key Insights:**
  1. **Position 3 (A)** is confirmed correct (✓), so the secret word must have ""A"" in the third position.
  2. **Position 5 (E)** is confirmed correct (✓), so the secret word ends with ""E"".
  3. **Letters C, R, and N** are absent (x) from the word entirely and must be avoided in future guesses.
- **Pattern Deduction:** The secret word follows the pattern `__ __ A __ E`, where:
  - Positions 1, 2, and 4 are unknown.
  - Letters C, R, and N are excluded.
- **Strategy for Next Guess:**  
  - Focus on common English letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, D) to maximize information.
  - Prioritize words that:
    - Maintain ""A"" in position 3 and ""E"" in position 5 (to respect confirmed positions).
    - Avoid C, R, N (known absent letters).
    - Test new high-frequency consonants/vowels for positions 1, 2, and 4.
  - Strong candidate words include ""**SLATE**"" or ""**STALE**"" (both common and test S, T, L efficiently). ""SLATE"" is selected here as it covers:
    - S (common starting letter).
    - T and L (frequently used consonants).
    - Unique letters to avoid redundancy.",Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, the user is asking me to make the first guess in a Wordle-style game. Since it's the first turn, I have no prior feedback to work with - I need to choose an optimal starting word based on common strategy. 

Hmm, I recall that effective starter words should contain frequent English letters and maximize coverage of common positions. Vowels like A/E/O and consonants like R/S/T are statistically strong. 

Let me evaluate some candidate words: ""CRANE"" comes to mind - it covers C,R,A,N,E which include three vowels and two common consonants. Alternative options like ""SLATE"" or ""ROAST"" also seem good, but ""CRANE"" has more unique letters. 

Double-checking: C is often in first position, R and A frequently appear in middle spots, N and E are common endings. This distribution might yield useful positional feedback. Plus, no repeated letters - efficient for information gathering. 

Potential drawback: misses U/I/O and consonants like L/T, but no single word can cover everything. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for now - it's a popular choice among experienced players for maximizing initial data. 

User hasn't expressed preferences, so I'll stick with this neutral mathematical approach. They'll get concrete feedback to build upon next turn.<thinking>
For the first guess, I need to select a word that maximizes the chances of getting useful feedback. The best approach is to choose a word with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starter because:
- It contains common letters: C, R, A, N, E
- It uses three vowels (A, E) and two frequent consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are unique, avoiding redundancy
- It covers positional diversity (C often starts words, E often ends words)
This choice should provide clear feedback to inform the next guess, regardless of whether letters are correct ✓, misplaced -, or absent x.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Therefore, we know:
- The 3rd letter is A.
- The 5th letter is E.
- C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Since A is in position 3 and E in position 5, the word pattern is: __ A __ E

We need to avoid using the letters C, R, and N.

For the second guess, we should try to include other common letters to test for the remaining positions.

Possible common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

We know the word has:
- Position 1: unknown (but not C, R)
- Position 2: unknown (but not C, R)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: unknown (but not C, R, and E is already at the end so it can't be E here? Wait, E is only at position 5, but it could appear again? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters but in this case, since we have two E's? Wait, note: we only know E is at the 5th position, but it might appear elsewhere? However, the feedback does not show duplicates unless present. Since we don't have any indication of duplicate, but it's possible.

But note: our first guess only had one E and it was correct at the end. If there were another E, we might have gotten an indication. However, in the standard rules, if a letter appears twice and we guess it twice, then if one is correct and the other is not, the second one might show as absent (if the word has only one E) or as misplaced (if there is a second E). But in this guess, we only have one E and it was correct. So the word has at least one E, but might have more? However, we don't know.

But the feedback didn't mark any other E because we didn't guess it elsewhere. So we have no information about duplicates.

Given the constraints:
- The word has at least A at position 3 and E at position 5.
- It does not contain C, R, N.

Let's think of words that end with E and have A in the third position.

Pattern: __ __ A __ E

Possible letters for the blanks: We have positions 1, 2, and 4 to fill.

We should pick a word that uses as many untested common letters as possible.

Common vowels and consonants remaining: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, H, B, etc.

I am considering words like:
- SALVE? But V is less common.
- SOARE? (a bird, not common) but let's stick to common words.

One good candidate is ""SHAME"": 
- S in position 1, H in position 2, A in 3, M in 4, E in 5? Pattern matches.

But we don't know if H or M are in the word. Also, S and M are common.

Another candidate: ""STALE"" but L and T? However, we have A in the 3rd which should be fixed? Wait, STALE has A in 2nd? No: STALE -> S T A L E -> A is in 3rd? Wait:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: A? Yes, so STALE has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th? 
But E is at 5th? S-T-A-L-E -> position 5 is E? Yes.

But we don't know if T and L are in the word? Also, we haven't tested S, T, L.

However, note feedback: we got E at 5th, so E is definitely at the end. But STALE has E at the 5th? Yes.

But wait: STALE has letters S,T,A,L,E. We know A is fixed at 3rd and E at 5th. We haven't eliminated T, S, L.

But note: our first guess had E at 5th, so STALE would also have E at 5th? Yes.

But also, our first guess showed that A is at 3rd, so STALE has A at 3? Yes because STALE: 
1: S, 2: T, 3: A, 4: L, 5: E -> so A is at 3, E at 5: perfect.

Now, we haven't tested S, T, L. And we know C, R, N are out.

But we are allowed to use T? Yes, because R is out, but T hasn't been tested? Correct.

However, we also got E at 5th, but in STALE, E is at 5th? Yes.

But let me check: our goal is to find what letters are in positions 1,2,4 and avoid known absent letters: C,R,N.

So STALE avoids C,R,N.

Alternatively, we could try ""SLATE"": 
- S L A T E -> A at 3, E at 5? 
- Position 1: S, 2: L, 3: A, 4: T, 5: E -> also fits.

SLATE is a common starting word too.

Both STALE and SLATE are good because they test multiple common letters.

But note: we have E at 5th and we know it's correct, so we don't need to test E again? Actually, we know E is correct at 5th, so any guess must have E at 5th? Not necessarily? Actually, no: the rules don't require that we reuse known correct letters? But if we don't put E at 5th, then if the word has E at 5th, our guess must have a letter at 5th that isn't E, so it would get an x? Which wastes one letter. So best to put E at 5th to lock that position since we know it's correct.

Similarly, we know A is at 3rd so we should put A at 3rd.

Therefore, our next guess must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.

So we are constrained to the pattern: __ __ A __ E

So for positions 1, 2, and 4, we pick letters that we haven't tried and that are common.

We haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, K, etc.

Avoid: C, R, N (since they are absent).

Now, I want to maximize the chance of getting more letters. So pick a word that uses three new letters that are common.

Possible words:

- **SOARE**: This is a word? (hawk) but uncommon? Might not be accepted. Avoid.

- **SLATE**: 
  - S, L, A, T, E -> letters: S, L, T (common) and avoids C,R,N.

- **STALE**: 
  - S, T, A, L, E -> same as SLATE, letters: S, T, L.

- **SHADE**: 
  - S, H, A, D, E -> also tests H and D.

- **SPADE**:
  - S, P, A, D, E -> tests P and D.

But we might prefer to get more feedback on more common letters? Like S and T.

Since we don't have any information about positions 1 and 2, and position 4, we can choose a word that uses S in position 1, T in position 2? Then position 4 we put another letter.

For example, ""STATE"" has two T's? And we don't know if there are duplicates? But STATE has A in the 3rd? STATE: S T A T E -> 
- Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). So A and E are in position 3 and 5? Yes.

But STATE has T at position 2 and 4. Since we got R absent, but T is new? And we haven't tested T? So okay? But let's see: the word might have T? Possibly.

But I think SLATE or STALE are better because they have distinct letters.

Let me consider:

- **SAUTE**: 
  - S A U T E -> Wait, A is at position 2? But we need A at position 3? So SAUTE: S-A-U-T-E -> Position 3 is U? Not A. So not valid.

So only words where the third letter is A and fifth is E.

Examples:

- BLAME: B L A M E -> good? but B is not very common? M is okay.
- FLAME: F L A M E -> but F might be less common.
- PLATE: P L A T E -> common letters: P, L, T.

PLATE might be a candidate: tests P, L, T.

But let's look for words with maybe more common letters? S and T are usually the most common.

So SLATE: S L A T E -> letters: S (common first letter), L (common), T (common).

Therefore, I'll go with SLATE because it uses common letters and doesn't duplicate any known ones.

Also, note: we haven't tested L, T, S? But we know they aren't in the absent list? Correct.

Therefore, for the next guess: SLATE

Feedback will tell us about S in position 1? Could be correct? Maybe misplaced? Or absent? Similarly L in 2? And T in 4? And we already know A and E are correct.

So let's output SLATE.### Step-by-Step Analysis of Previous Feedback:

We have two sets of feedback:

From Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- A is in the 3rd position (confirmed)
- E is in the 5th position (confirmed)
- C, R, N are not in the word at all

From Guess 2: slate -> S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- S is in the 1st position (confirmed) because it got a ✓
- L is not in the word at all (x) so we can eliminate L
- A is confirmed again in 3rd position (as before)
- T is not in the word at all (x)
- E is confirmed again in 5th position (as before)

So, combining the information:

- The word starts with S (position 1)
- Position 3 is A
- Position 5 is E
- The absent letters are: C, R, N, L, T

Therefore, the pattern so far is: S _ A _ E

We now need to find:
- Letter for position 2 (which cannot be C, R, N, L, T or any other eliminated letters)
- Letter for position 4 (same constraints)

Additionally, we must ensure these letters are part of the word.

We know from the feedback of ""slate"" that L and T are absent, so they are eliminated.

Reconfirmed absent letters: C, R, N (from first guess) and L, T (from second guess).

So, excluded letters: C, R, N, L, T

Now, what letters remain? We need to find possible candidates for positions 2 and 4 in S _ A _ E

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But given this is a 5-letter word ending with E and starting with S, we can think of common patterns.

Possible words matching S _ A _ E:

- SHADE: S H A D E
- SHAPE: S H A P E
- SHAME: S H A M E
- SHAVE: S H A V E
- SHAKE: S H A K E
- SPADE: S P A D E
- SNARE? But N is absent! (from first guess: N(x)) -> SNARE has N? So invalid? Position 4? N is eliminated so can't be.
- SOARE? But O and E? Position is S O A R E, but R is eliminated -> R is absent so not possible.
- SCARE? But C is absent -> cannot.

Focusing on possible words:

To maximize information, since we have to fill positions 2 and 4, we should choose a word that uses two new, commonly occurring letters.

For example, ""SHADE"" would test H and D.

""SHAPE"" would test H and P.

""SPADE"" would test P and D (but we haven't tried P or D or H, etc.)

We don't know if H is in the word? From Guess 2, we have no information about H because we didn't use it.

Similarly, other letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries so far we've used 2, and we have 4 more? Yes.

Strategy: choose a word that uses two letters we haven't tried yet? And also common.

Possible words:
- SHADE: letters H and D
- SHAPE: H and P
- SHAME: H and M
- SHAVE: H and V
- SPADE: P and D
- SKATE: K and T, but T is absent -> SKATE has T? Position 4? T is eliminated? So SKATE invalid.
- SLATE we already guessed? And it had T eliminated? So no.

Now, SHADE and SHAPE are both common words? Yes.

Since we have limited guesses, I should pick one that might yield more information? Both test two letters.

I'll go with ""SHADE"" because H and D are both common letters? But P is also common.

Another consideration: because position 2 is likely a vowel? Or consonant? S followed by? Like S H, S P, etc.

Perhaps ""SHADE"" is fine.

But let me be methodical.

Since we know position 2 and 4 need filling, and we must avoid eliminated letters: C, R, N, L, T.

Now, for the guess, we want to:
- Confirm positions 1,3,5 are S,A,E respectively? They are already confirmed? So we should include them? Actually, we know S is at 1, A at 3, E at 5? Yes? Because both guesses confirmed them? So to save turns, we should reuse that knowledge? Yes? So our next guess must start with S, have A in the 3rd, end with E? Exactly? Otherwise, if we put a different letter at position 1, it would get an 'x' if it's not S? So that wastes a spot? Yes, so we should keep the known letters in place? So pattern: S ? A ? E

Therefore, our guess must be of the form S _ A _ E.

So our options are very limited? We need to choose a word that is S X A Y E, where X and Y not in {C,R,N,L,T}

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,U,V,W,Y,Z

But not all combinations are words.

Common words:

- SHADE: X=H, Y=D
- SHAPE: X=H, Y=P
- SHAME: X=H, Y=M
- SPADE: X=P, Y=D
- SHAKE: X=H, Y=K
- SHAVE: X=H, Y=V
- STAGE? But T is eliminated? Position 2: T? But T is absent? So STAGE has T? Eliminated? So no.
- SOAPY? But E at end? Not E? So no.

Now, which to choose?

I should pick one that tests letters that are more likely? Or just pick one to get feedback.

Alternatively, to maximize information, is there a word that uses two common letters we haven't tried? For example, ""SHADE"" tests H and D.

But there's no word that includes many untested letters at once? Only two positions.

So I'll go with ""SHADE"" because it's common.

After this guess, we'll get feedback on H at position 2 and D at position 4? If they are correct? Misplaced? Etc.

Let me output SHADE.

Alternative: ""SPADE"" uses P and D? Also fine.

But SHADE is very common.

Decision: Use ""SHADE"".

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, the user is asking me to make the first guess in a Wordle-style game. Since it's the first turn, I have no prior feedback to work with - I need to choose an optimal starting word based on common strategy. 

Hmm, I recall that effective starter words should contain frequent English letters and maximize coverage of common positions. Vowels like A/E/O and consonants like R/S/T are statistically strong. 

Let me evaluate some candidate words: ""CRANE"" comes to mind - it covers C,R,A,N,E which include three vowels and two common consonants. Alternative options like ""SLATE"" or ""ROAST"" also seem good, but ""CRANE"" has more unique letters. 

Double-checking: C is often in first position, R and A frequently appear in middle spots, N and E are common endings. This distribution might yield useful positional feedback. Plus, no repeated letters - efficient for information gathering. 

Potential drawback: misses U/I/O and consonants like L/T, but no single word can cover everything. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for now - it's a popular choice among experienced players for maximizing initial data. 

User hasn't expressed preferences, so I'll stick with this neutral mathematical approach. They'll get concrete feedback to build upon next turn.<thinking>
For the first guess, I need to select a word that maximizes the chances of getting useful feedback. The best approach is to choose a word with common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" is often recommended as a strong starter because:
- It contains common letters: C, R, A, N, E
- It uses three vowels (A, E) and two frequent consonants (C, R, N)
- All letters are unique, avoiding redundancy
- It covers positional diversity (C often starts words, E often ends words)
This choice should provide clear feedback to inform the next guess, regardless of whether letters are correct ✓, misplaced -, or absent x.
</thinking>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so A is the 3rd letter)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct and in the correct position, so E is the 5th letter)

Therefore, we know:
- The 3rd letter is A.
- The 5th letter is E.
- C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Since A is in position 3 and E in position 5, the word pattern is: __ A __ E

We need to avoid using the letters C, R, and N.

For the second guess, we should try to include other common letters to test for the remaining positions.

Possible common letters: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, etc.

We know the word has:
- Position 1: unknown (but not C, R)
- Position 2: unknown (but not C, R)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: unknown (but not C, R, and E is already at the end so it can't be E here? Wait, E is only at position 5, but it could appear again? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters but in this case, since we have two E's? Wait, note: we only know E is at the 5th position, but it might appear elsewhere? However, the feedback does not show duplicates unless present. Since we don't have any indication of duplicate, but it's possible.

But note: our first guess only had one E and it was correct at the end. If there were another E, we might have gotten an indication. However, in the standard rules, if a letter appears twice and we guess it twice, then if one is correct and the other is not, the second one might show as absent (if the word has only one E) or as misplaced (if there is a second E). But in this guess, we only have one E and it was correct. So the word has at least one E, but might have more? However, we don't know.

But the feedback didn't mark any other E because we didn't guess it elsewhere. So we have no information about duplicates.

Given the constraints:
- The word has at least A at position 3 and E at position 5.
- It does not contain C, R, N.

Let's think of words that end with E and have A in the third position.

Pattern: __ __ A __ E

Possible letters for the blanks: We have positions 1, 2, and 4 to fill.

We should pick a word that uses as many untested common letters as possible.

Common vowels and consonants remaining: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, H, B, etc.

I am considering words like:
- SALVE? But V is less common.
- SOARE? (a bird, not common) but let's stick to common words.

One good candidate is ""SHAME"": 
- S in position 1, H in position 2, A in 3, M in 4, E in 5? Pattern matches.

But we don't know if H or M are in the word. Also, S and M are common.

Another candidate: ""STALE"" but L and T? However, we have A in the 3rd which should be fixed? Wait, STALE has A in 2nd? No: STALE -> S T A L E -> A is in 3rd? Wait:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: A? Yes, so STALE has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th? 
But E is at 5th? S-T-A-L-E -> position 5 is E? Yes.

But we don't know if T and L are in the word? Also, we haven't tested S, T, L.

However, note feedback: we got E at 5th, so E is definitely at the end. But STALE has E at the 5th? Yes.

But wait: STALE has letters S,T,A,L,E. We know A is fixed at 3rd and E at 5th. We haven't eliminated T, S, L.

But note: our first guess had E at 5th, so STALE would also have E at 5th? Yes.

But also, our first guess showed that A is at 3rd, so STALE has A at 3? Yes because STALE: 
1: S, 2: T, 3: A, 4: L, 5: E -> so A is at 3, E at 5: perfect.

Now, we haven't tested S, T, L. And we know C, R, N are out.

But we are allowed to use T? Yes, because R is out, but T hasn't been tested? Correct.

However, we also got E at 5th, but in STALE, E is at 5th? Yes.

But let me check: our goal is to find what letters are in positions 1,2,4 and avoid known absent letters: C,R,N.

So STALE avoids C,R,N.

Alternatively, we could try ""SLATE"": 
- S L A T E -> A at 3, E at 5? 
- Position 1: S, 2: L, 3: A, 4: T, 5: E -> also fits.

SLATE is a common starting word too.

Both STALE and SLATE are good because they test multiple common letters.

But note: we have E at 5th and we know it's correct, so we don't need to test E again? Actually, we know E is correct at 5th, so any guess must have E at 5th? Not necessarily? Actually, no: the rules don't require that we reuse known correct letters? But if we don't put E at 5th, then if the word has E at 5th, our guess must have a letter at 5th that isn't E, so it would get an x? Which wastes one letter. So best to put E at 5th to lock that position since we know it's correct.

Similarly, we know A is at 3rd so we should put A at 3rd.

Therefore, our next guess must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.

So we are constrained to the pattern: __ __ A __ E

So for positions 1, 2, and 4, we pick letters that we haven't tried and that are common.

We haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, K, etc.

Avoid: C, R, N (since they are absent).

Now, I want to maximize the chance of getting more letters. So pick a word that uses three new letters that are common.

Possible words:

- **SOARE**: This is a word? (hawk) but uncommon? Might not be accepted. Avoid.

- **SLATE**: 
  - S, L, A, T, E -> letters: S, L, T (common) and avoids C,R,N.

- **STALE**: 
  - S, T, A, L, E -> same as SLATE, letters: S, T, L.

- **SHADE**: 
  - S, H, A, D, E -> also tests H and D.

- **SPADE**:
  - S, P, A, D, E -> tests P and D.

But we might prefer to get more feedback on more common letters? Like S and T.

Since we don't have any information about positions 1 and 2, and position 4, we can choose a word that uses S in position 1, T in position 2? Then position 4 we put another letter.

For example, ""STATE"" has two T's? And we don't know if there are duplicates? But STATE has A in the 3rd? STATE: S T A T E -> 
- Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). So A and E are in position 3 and 5? Yes.

But STATE has T at position 2 and 4. Since we got R absent, but T is new? And we haven't tested T? So okay? But let's see: the word might have T? Possibly.

But I think SLATE or STALE are better because they have distinct letters.

Let me consider:

- **SAUTE**: 
  - S A U T E -> Wait, A is at position 2? But we need A at position 3? So SAUTE: S-A-U-T-E -> Position 3 is U? Not A. So not valid.

So only words where the third letter is A and fifth is E.

Examples:

- BLAME: B L A M E -> good? but B is not very common? M is okay.
- FLAME: F L A M E -> but F might be less common.
- PLATE: P L A T E -> common letters: P, L, T.

PLATE might be a candidate: tests P, L, T.

But let's look for words with maybe more common letters? S and T are usually the most common.

So SLATE: S L A T E -> letters: S (common first letter), L (common), T (common).

Therefore, I'll go with SLATE because it uses common letters and doesn't duplicate any known ones.

Also, note: we haven't tested L, T, S? But we know they aren't in the absent list? Correct.

Therefore, for the next guess: SLATE

Feedback will tell us about S in position 1? Could be correct? Maybe misplaced? Or absent? Similarly L in 2? And T in 4? And we already know A and E are correct.

So let's output SLATE.### Step-by-Step Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Previous Guess:** ""crane""
- **Feedback:** C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
- **Key Insights:**
  1. **Position 3 (A)** is confirmed correct (✓), so the secret word must have ""A"" in the third position.
  2. **Position 5 (E)** is confirmed correct (✓), so the secret word ends with ""E"".
  3. **Letters C, R, and N** are absent (x) from the word entirely and must be avoided in future guesses.
- **Pattern Deduction:** The secret word follows the pattern `__ __ A __ E`, where:
  - Positions 1, 2, and 4 are unknown.
  - Letters C, R, and N are excluded.
- **Strategy for Next Guess:**  
  - Focus on common English letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, D) to maximize information.
  - Prioritize words that:
    - Maintain ""A"" in position 3 and ""E"" in position 5 (to respect confirmed positions).
    - Avoid C, R, N (known absent letters).
    - Test new high-frequency consonants/vowels for positions 1, 2, and 4.
  - Strong candidate words include ""**SLATE**"" or ""**STALE**"" (both common and test S, T, L efficiently). ""SLATE"" is selected here as it covers:
    - S (common starting letter).
    - T and L (frequently used consonants).
    - Unique letters to avoid redundancy.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

From Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- A is in the 3rd position (confirmed)
- E is in the 5th position (confirmed)
- C, R, N are not in the word at all

From Guess 2: slate -> S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
- S is in the 1st position (confirmed) because it got a ✓
- L is not in the word at all (x) so we can eliminate L
- A is confirmed again in 3rd position (as before)
- T is not in the word at all (x)
- E is confirmed again in 5th position (as before)

So, combining the information:

- The word starts with S (position 1)
- Position 3 is A
- Position 5 is E
- The absent letters are: C, R, N, L, T

Therefore, the pattern so far is: S _ A _ E

We now need to find:
- Letter for position 2 (which cannot be C, R, N, L, T or any other eliminated letters)
- Letter for position 4 (same constraints)

Additionally, we must ensure these letters are part of the word.

We know from the feedback of ""slate"" that L and T are absent, so they are eliminated.

Reconfirmed absent letters: C, R, N (from first guess) and L, T (from second guess).

So, excluded letters: C, R, N, L, T

Now, what letters remain? We need to find possible candidates for positions 2 and 4 in S _ A _ E

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But given this is a 5-letter word ending with E and starting with S, we can think of common patterns.

Possible words matching S _ A _ E:

- SHADE: S H A D E
- SHAPE: S H A P E
- SHAME: S H A M E
- SHAVE: S H A V E
- SHAKE: S H A K E
- SPADE: S P A D E
- SNARE? But N is absent! (from first guess: N(x)) -> SNARE has N? So invalid? Position 4? N is eliminated so can't be.
- SOARE? But O and E? Position is S O A R E, but R is eliminated -> R is absent so not possible.
- SCARE? But C is absent -> cannot.

Focusing on possible words:

To maximize information, since we have to fill positions 2 and 4, we should choose a word that uses two new, commonly occurring letters.

For example, ""SHADE"" would test H and D.

""SHAPE"" would test H and P.

""SPADE"" would test P and D (but we haven't tried P or D or H, etc.)

We don't know if H is in the word? From Guess 2, we have no information about H because we didn't use it.

Similarly, other letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries so far we've used 2, and we have 4 more? Yes.

Strategy: choose a word that uses two letters we haven't tried yet? And also common.

Possible words:
- SHADE: letters H and D
- SHAPE: H and P
- SHAME: H and M
- SHAVE: H and V
- SPADE: P and D
- SKATE: K and T, but T is absent -> SKATE has T? Position 4? T is eliminated? So SKATE invalid.
- SLATE we already guessed? And it had T eliminated? So no.

Now, SHADE and SHAPE are both common words? Yes.

Since we have limited guesses, I should pick one that might yield more information? Both test two letters.

I'll go with ""SHADE"" because H and D are both common letters? But P is also common.

Another consideration: because position 2 is likely a vowel? Or consonant? S followed by? Like S H, S P, etc.

Perhaps ""SHADE"" is fine.

But let me be methodical.

Since we know position 2 and 4 need filling, and we must avoid eliminated letters: C, R, N, L, T.

Now, for the guess, we want to:
- Confirm positions 1,3,5 are S,A,E respectively? They are already confirmed? So we should include them? Actually, we know S is at 1, A at 3, E at 5? Yes? Because both guesses confirmed them? So to save turns, we should reuse that knowledge? Yes? So our next guess must start with S, have A in the 3rd, end with E? Exactly? Otherwise, if we put a different letter at position 1, it would get an 'x' if it's not S? So that wastes a spot? Yes, so we should keep the known letters in place? So pattern: S ? A ? E

Therefore, our guess must be of the form S _ A _ E.

So our options are very limited? We need to choose a word that is S X A Y E, where X and Y not in {C,R,N,L,T}

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,U,V,W,Y,Z

But not all combinations are words.

Common words:

- SHADE: X=H, Y=D
- SHAPE: X=H, Y=P
- SHAME: X=H, Y=M
- SPADE: X=P, Y=D
- SHAKE: X=H, Y=K
- SHAVE: X=H, Y=V
- STAGE? But T is eliminated? Position 2: T? But T is absent? So STAGE has T? Eliminated? So no.
- SOAPY? But E at end? Not E? So no.

Now, which to choose?

I should pick one that tests letters that are more likely? Or just pick one to get feedback.

Alternatively, to maximize information, is there a word that uses two common letters we haven't tried? For example, ""SHADE"" tests H and D.

But there's no word that includes many untested letters at once? Only two positions.

So I'll go with ""SHADE"" because it's common.

After this guess, we'll get feedback on H at position 2 and D at position 4? If they are correct? Misplaced? Etc.

Let me output SHADE.

Alternative: ""SPADE"" uses P and D? Also fine.

But SHADE is very common.

Decision: Use ""SHADE"".### Step-by-Step Analysis of Previous Feedback:

  - **Untested Common Letters:** Focus on high-frequency letters like D, H, M, P, K to maximize information gain (e.g., H is common in ""S _ A _ E"" patterns).

- **Strategy for Next Guess:**  
  - Maintain confirmed positions: Start with **S**, **A** at position 3, and end with **E**.  
  - Test new high-frequency letters for positions 2 and 4.  
  - Prioritize words like **SHADE** (tests H at position 2 and D at position 4) because:  
    - H and D are common untested letters.  
    - ""SHADE"" is a valid English word fitting the pattern.  
    - Feedback will efficiently clarify if H/D are present, misplaced, or absent.

Since we don\'t have any indication of duplicate, but it\'s possible.\n\nBut note: our first guess only had one E and it was correct at the end. If there were another E, we might have gotten an indication. However, in the standard rules, if a letter appears twice and we guess it twice, then if one is correct and the other is not, the second one might show as absent (if the word has only one E) or as misplaced (if there is a second E). But in this guess, we only have one E and it was correct. So the word has at least one E, but might have more? However, we don\'t know.\n\nBut the feedback didn\'t mark any other E because we didn\'t guess it elsewhere. So we have no information about duplicates.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- The word has at least A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n- It does not contain C, R, N.\n\nLet\'s think of words that end with E and have A in the third position.\n\nPattern: __ __ A __ E\n\nPossible letters for the blanks: We have positions 1, 2, and 4 to fill.\n\nWe should pick a word that uses as many untested common letters as possible.\n\nCommon vowels and consonants remaining: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, H, B, etc.\n\nI am considering words like:\n- SALVE?

Pattern matches.\n\nBut we don\'t know if H or M are in the word. Also, S and M are common.\n\nAnother candidate: ""STALE"" but L and T? However, we have A in the 3rd which should be fixed? Wait, STALE has A in 2nd? No: STALE -> S T A L E -> A is in 3rd? Wait:\n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: T\n- Position 3: A? Yes, so STALE has A in the 3rd and E in the 5th? \nBut E is at 5th? S-T-A-L-E -> position 5 is E? Yes.\n\nBut we don\'t know if T and L are in the word? Also, we haven\'t tested S, T, L.\n\nHowever, note feedback: we got E at 5th, so E is definitely at the end. But STALE has E at the 5th? Yes.\n\nBut wait: STALE has letters S,T,A,L,E. We know A is fixed at 3rd and E at 5th. We haven\'t eliminated T, S, L.\n\nBut note: our first guess had E at 5th, so STALE would also have E at 5th? Yes.\n\nBut also, our first guess showed that A is at 3rd, so STALE has A at 3? Yes because STALE: \n1: S, 2: T, 3: A, 4: L, 5: E -> so A is at 3, E at 5: perfect.\n\nNow, we haven\'t tested S, T, L. And we know C, R, N are out.\n\nBut we are allowed to use T? Yes, because R is out, but T hasn\'t been tested? Correct.\n\nHowever, we also got E at 5th, but in STALE, E is at 5th? Yes.\n\nBut let me check: our goal is to find what letters are in positions 1,2,4 and avoid known absent letters: C,R,N.\n\nSo STALE avoids C,R,N.\n\nAlternatively, we could try ""SLATE"": \n- S L A T E -> A at 3, E at 5? \n- Position 1: S, 2: L, 3: A, 4: T, 5: E -> also fits.\n\nSLATE is a common starting word too.\n\nBoth STALE and SLATE are good because they test multiple common letters.\n\nBut note: we have E at 5th and we know it\'s correct, so we don\'t need to test E again? Actually, we know E is correct at 5th, so any guess must have E at 5th? Not necessarily? Actually, no: the rules don\'t require that we reuse known correct letters? But if we don\'t put E at 5th, then if the word has E at 5th, our guess must have a letter at 5th that isn\'t E, so it would get an x? Which wastes one letter. So best to put E at 5th to lock that position since we know it\'s correct.\n\nSimilarly, we know A is at 3rd so we should put A at 3rd.\n\nTherefore, our next guess must have A at position 3 and E at position 5.\n\nSo we are constrained to the pattern: __ __ A __ E\n\nSo for positions 1, 2, and 4, we pick letters that we haven\'t tried and that are common.\n\nWe haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, K, etc.\n\nAvoid: C, R, N (since they are absent).\n\nNow, I want to maximize the chance of getting more letters. So pick a word that uses three new letters that are common.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- **SOARE**: This is a word? (hawk) but uncommon? Might not be accepted. Avoid.\n\n- **SLATE**: \n  - S, L, A, T, E -> letters: S, L, T (common) and avoids C,R,N.\n\n- **STALE**: \n  - S, T, A, L, E -> same as SLATE, letters: S, T, L.\n\n- **SHADE**: \n  - S, H, A, D, E -> also tests H and D.\n\n- **SPADE**:\n  - S, P, A, D, E -> tests P and D.\n\nBut we might prefer to get more feedback on more common letters? Like S and T.\n\nSince we don\'t have any information about positions 1 and 2, and position 4, we can choose a word that uses S in position 1, T in position 2? Then position 4 we put another letter.\n\nFor example, ""STATE"" has two T\'s? And we don\'t know if there are duplicates? But STATE has A in the 3rd? STATE: S T A T E -> \n- Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). So A and E are in position 3 and 5? Yes.\n\nBut STATE has T at position 2 and 4. Since we got R absent, but T is new? And we haven\'t tested T? So okay? But let\'s see: the word might have T? Possibly.\n\nBut I think SLATE or STALE are better because they have distinct letters.\n\nLet me consider:\n\n- **SAUTE**: \n  - S A U T E -> Wait, A is at position 2? But we need A at position 3? So SAUTE: S-A-U-T-E -> Position 3 is U? Not A. So not valid.\n\nSo only words where the third letter is A and fifth is E.\n\nExamples:\n\n- BLAME: B L A M E -> good? but B is not very common? M is okay.\n- FLAME: F L A M E -> but F might be less common.\n- PLATE: P L A T E -> common letters: P, L, T.\n\nPLATE might be a candidate: tests P, L, T.\n\nBut let\'s look for words with maybe more common letters? S and T are usually the most common.\n\nSo SLATE: S L A T E -> letters: S (common first letter), L (common), T (common).\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with SLATE because it uses common letters and doesn\'t duplicate any known ones.\n\nAlso, note: we haven\'t tested L, T, S? But we know they aren\'t in the absent list? Correct.\n\nTherefore, for the next guess: SLATE\n\nFeedback will tell us about S in position 1? Could be correct? Maybe misplaced? Or absent? Similarly L in 2? And T in 4? And we already know A and E are correct.\n\nSo let\'s output SLATE.### Step-by-Step Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Previous Guess:** ""crane""\n- **Feedback:** C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\n- **Key Insights:**\n  1. **Position 3 (A)** is confirmed correct (✓), so the secret word must have ""A"" in the third position.\n  2. **Position 5 (E)** is confirmed correct (✓), so the secret word ends with ""E"".\n  3. **Letters C, R, and N** are absent (x) from the word entirely and must be avoided in future guesses.\n- **Pattern Deduction:** The secret word follows the pattern `__ __ A __ E`, where:\n  - Positions 1, 2, and 4 are unknown.\n  - Letters C, R, and N are excluded.\n- **Strategy for Next Guess:**  \n  - Focus on common English letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, O, I, D) to maximize information.\n  - Prioritize words that:\n    - Maintain ""A"" in position 3 and ""E"" in position 5 (to respect confirmed positions).\n    - Avoid C, R, N (known absent letters).\n    - Test new high-frequency consonants/vowels for positions 1, 2, and 4.\n  - Strong candidate words include ""**SLATE**"" or ""**STALE**"" (both common and test S, T, L efficiently).

So our next guess must start with S, have A in the 3rd, end with E? Exactly? Otherwise, if we put a different letter at position 1, it would get an \'x\' if it\'s not S? So that wastes a spot? Yes, so we should keep the known letters in place? So pattern: S ? A ? E\n\nTherefore, our guess must be of the form S _ A _ E.\n\nSo our options are very limited? We need to choose a word that is S X A Y E, where X and Y not in {C,R,N,L,T}\n\nAvailable letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,U,V,W,Y,Z\n\nBut not all combinations are words.\n\nCommon words:\n\n- SHADE: X=H, Y=D\n- SHAPE: X=H, Y=P\n- SHAME: X=H, Y=M\n- SPADE: X=P, Y=D\n- SHAKE: X=H, Y=K\n- SHAVE: X=H, Y=V\n- STAGE? But T is eliminated? Position 2: T? But T is absent? So STAGE has T? Eliminated? So no.\n- SOAPY? But E at end? Not E? So no.\n\nNow, which to choose?\n\nI should pick one that tests letters that are more likely? Or just pick one to get feedback.\n\nAlternatively, to maximize information, is there a word that uses two common letters we haven\'t tried? For example, ""SHADE"" tests H and D.\n\nBut there\'s no word that includes many untested letters at once? Only two positions.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SHADE"" because it\'s common.\n\nAfter this guess, we\'ll get feedback on H at position 2 and D at position 4? If they are correct? Misplaced? Etc.\n\nLet me output SHADE.\n\nAlternative: ""SPADE"" uses P and D? Also fine.\n\nBut SHADE is very common.\n\nDecision: Use ""SHADE"".### Step-by-Step Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Previous Guesses and Feedback:**\n  - **Guess 1 (CRANE):** C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)  \n    → Revealed that **A** is in **position 3** and **E** is in **position 5**.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
- This told us that A is in the correct position (3rd) and E is in the correct position (5th). C, R, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
- S is correct and in the 1st position. A and E reconfirmed correct. L and T are not in the word.

Guess 3: shade -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) A(✓) D(✓) E(✓)
- S, A, E are correct as before. Now D is correct and in the 4th position (since it's the fourth letter). H is not in the word.

So, putting it all together:
- Position 1: S (confirmed)
- Position 3: A (confirmed)
- Position 4: D (a new confirmation from guess 3)
- Position 5: E (confirmed)
- Only position 2 remains unknown.

Also, we know the absent letters: C, R, N, L, T, H.

The word pattern is: S _ A D E

We must find a letter for the second position that is not one of the absent letters (C,R,N,L,T,H).

Possible common letters left: B, F, G, I, K, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, Z.

But the word must be a valid English word: ""S?ADE"".

Common words in this pattern:
- ""SPADE"" - but we tested ""shade"" and H is absent, but P is not yet eliminated? However, note that in ""shade"", S was correct, so ""spade"" would have P in position 2? Let's list:

Possible words: 
- SPADE: P is not tested? But wait, pattern: S P A D E -> position 2 is P? We haven't tested P? And it fits? But is P eliminated? No? From prior guesses? 

Other options:
- ""STADE""? But T is absent? Eliminated? Guess 2: STALE had T(x) -> so T absent? Yes? So STADE has T? Cannot? Also S T A D E? Position 2 T? Eliminated? So no? 

- ""SNARE""? But N absent? From guess 1? Cannot? Also S N A R E? R absent? 

- ""SHAME""? H absent? We got H(x) now? From shade? So SHAME has H? Cannot?

- ""SCARE""? C absent? Cannot? 

So possible common words? Only SPADE? And then? What else?

There is ""SPADE"" and also ""SHADE"" we already guessed? But shade is done? 

Another word: ""STAGE""? But position 4 should be D? And E at end? But STAGE is S T A G E? Which would be pattern S? A? E? But D is fixed? In our case? We know position 4 is D? Because D(✓) in shade? So must be D at 4? 

So the word must be S X A D E? With X not in {C,R,N,L,T,H}? 

What are the possibilities? 

- B: ""SBADE""? Not a word? 
- F: ""SFADE""? Not a word? 
- G: ""SGADE""? Not common? 
- I: ""SIADE""? No? 
- K: ""SKADE""? Not standard? 
- M: ""SMADE""? Not standard? 
- O: ""SOADE""? Not common? 
- P: ""SPADE"" -> valid? 
- U: ""SUADE""? As in ""dissuade"" but not 5 letters? ""Suade"" not common? But ""SUADE""? 
- V: ""SVADE""? No? 
- W: ""SWADE""? Not common? 
- Y: ""SYADE""? No? 
- Z: ""SZADE""? No? 

So the only common word fitting the pattern is SPADE? 

But let's confirm: SPADE is a 5-letter word? Meaning: a digging tool? Correct? 

Also, ""SPADE"" uses P? which hasn't been tested? 

Now? from previous feedback? We haven't eliminated P? 

Therefore? we can guess ""SPADE""? 

But note: if it is SPADE? we get all correct? 

But the word might be something else? Are there other words? 

Another possibility: ""STADE""? but T is eliminated? Cannot? 

Or ""SHADE""? but we guessed shade and D was correct? but H was absent? and S,A,E correct? so if it was shade? we would have won? But we didn't? so it's not shade? 

Similarly? ""SLADE"" is a word? meaning a valley? but L is absent? L(x) from slate? so cannot? 

""SNIDE""? Not fitting? S N I D E? Position 4 must be D? but position 3 is I? but pattern S? A D E must have A at position 3? So SNIDE? S N I D E -> position 3 is I? not A? so doesn't fit the pattern? 

Therefore? SPADE is the only common word? 

But let's double-check: 
- SPADE: S at 1? P at 2? A at 3? D at 4? E at 5? 

Matches pattern? 

Absent letters: we have to avoid C,R,N,L,T,H? P is not among them? 

Therefore? guess ""spade""? 

But note: in the feedback? we got H(x)? meaning H is absent? so SPADE has no H? okay? 

Therefore? I think ""spade"" is the answer? 

Alternatively? if not? we might get feedback? 

But logically? SPADE should be it? 

So let's output SPADE? 

But wait? if we guess SPADE? and it's the secret word? we win? if not? feedback will tell? 

But since it fits? and we don't know of other words? so proceed? 

Conclusion? guess ""SPADE""

    Secret word pattern: **S ? A D E**
  - **Absent Letters:** C, R, N, L, T, H (excluded).
  - **Unknown Position:**  
    - Position 2: Must be a letter not excluded (untested common letters include B, F, G, K, M, O, P, U, V, Y).
  - Only **one position** remains unknown → Focus on valid English words fitting **S _ A D E**.

- **Strategy for Next Guess:**  
  - Test the unknown position 2 using unused common letters.  
  - **SPADE** is the only high-frequency valid word fitting the pattern:  
    - **S** (position 1, confirmed)  
    - **P** (untested common letter for position 2)  
    - **A** (position 3, confirmed)  
    - **D** (position 4, confirmed)  
    - **E** (position 5, confirmed).  
  - Feedback will confirm if **P** is correct ✓, misplaced -, or absent x, resolving the word.

- Position 4: D (a new confirmation from guess 3)
- Position 5: E (confirmed)
