We are starting the game. We have no information yet, so we should choose a word that can give us a lot of information.
 A good starting word often has common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information gain.
 Common starting words in Wordle are like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let me pick one.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
</think>
<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A balanced word like ""CRANE"" is effective because:
- It includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- The letters (C, R, A, N, E) frequently appear in English words, helping identify correct letters/positions quickly.
This sets a strong foundation for subsequent guesses based on feedback.

We are given feedback that for the first guess ""crane"", all letters are incorrect (x). 
 This means that the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Therefore, we must choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these letters.

 We need to pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E) might include: 
   S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

 A good starting point might be a word like ""SLOTH"" or ""PILOT"", but let's think of one that avoids the excluded letters.

 Since we have excluded 5 letters, we have a lot of the alphabet left.

 Let's consider: 
   S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, W, F, K, V, etc.

 We can try a word that has common letters we haven't tried yet.

 Example: ""SLIMY"" -> but let's check: S, L, I, M, Y. None of these are in the excluded set (C,R,A,N,E). 

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T -> but N is excluded (we got x for N in the first guess). So we cannot use N.

 We must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Another idea: ""LIGHT"" -> L, I, G, H, T. All these are not excluded.

 But we might want to cover more common letters. Let's try ""TOILS"" or ""STOMP"".

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me list some common letters we haven't used: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, V, W, X, Z (but X and Z are less common).

 We can try a word that uses 5 of the most common remaining letters.

 According to letter frequency in English, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common are: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H.

 We can try: ""SIGHT"" -> S, I, G, H, T. This covers S, I, G, H, T.

 Another option: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T. This covers M, O, I, S, T.

 ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has common letters and we haven't tried any of them.

 Alternatively, ""PLUMB"" but that has B which is less common and we might not get as much information.

 Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 So the next guess: ""moist""
</think>
<thinking>
The feedback for ""crane"" showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word must consist entirely of letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, A, N, E). 

To maximize information gain, I should choose a new word that:
1. Uses 5 entirely new, high-frequency English letters not yet tested.
2. Avoids repeating the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).
3. Prioritizes common consonants and vowels from the remaining set.

The most frequent remaining letters in English 5-letter words are: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, V, W. 

A strong candidate is **""MOIST""** because:
- It uses 5 common letters: M, O, I, S, T.
- All letters are distinct, increasing coverage.
- It includes the vowel O and I, plus high-frequency consonants (S, T, M).
- No overlap with excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities based on the feedback for M, O, I, S, and T.

 Important: Since we have S marked as ""-"", it means the secret word contains S, but not in the 4th position (because in ""moist"", S is the 4th letter).

 Also, we have now excluded the following letters: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and M, O, I, T (from second guess) -> total excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

 So the word must contain S and must not contain any of the excluded letters. Also, we know S is not in the 4th position.

 We need to make a new guess that:
 1. Includes S (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 4th position.
 2. Avoids any of the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T.
 3. Uses new letters to gain more information.

 What letters are available? We've excluded 9 letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.
 The remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: S is confirmed and must be included, so our guess must have S in one of the positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4).

 Now, we need to choose a word with S and 4 other letters from the remaining set.

 Considering common English words, we might consider using common letters from the remaining set.

 The most common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y.

 Let's try to form a word with S and some of these.

 Possible words:
 - We can try words with S at the start or end.

 Examples:
  - ""SLEEP"" but E is excluded -> invalid.
  - ""SKULL"": S at start, K, U, L, L. However, we have excluded letters? K, U, L are not excluded, but we have two L's -> but the word may have repeated letters? We don't know, but it's allowed.

 But note: we have not encountered repeated letters in feedback so far, but the secret word might have repeats.

 How about ""SLUMP""? But M is excluded -> invalid.

 Let's list possible words:

  We have to use S and avoid excluded letters.

 Some ideas:

 - ""SALAD"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
 - ""SHYLY"" -> S, H, Y, L, Y -> Y twice, and H, Y, L are available. But is SHYLY allowed? It's a valid word.

 However, we want to cover multiple common letters. Let's try:

 - ""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> two K's. Valid?
 - ""SPLIT"": but P is available, L, I (excluded) -> I is excluded, invalid.

 Since I is excluded, we can't use I.

 Another: ""SHOWY"" -> S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is excluded -> invalid.

 We are avoiding O because it's excluded.

 After excluding M,O,I,T, and first set, we must use letters from: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 Let's try to form words:

 - ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all allowed? Yes. And S is at position 1. But note: we need to avoid the 4th position for S? Our S can be anywhere except position 4. So position 1 is fine.

 However, ""SULKY"" has U, L, K, Y. Also, we don't know if U, L, K, Y are in the word.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SWUNG"": S, W, U, N, G -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

 How about ""SHULK""? Not a common word.

 ""SIGHT"": but I and G? I is excluded -> invalid.

 Another: ""SKULK"" might be acceptable? Or ""SKYED""? But less common.

 Let's consider: ""LYSSA"" -> but not 5 letters? Actually, L-Y-S-S-A -> but A is excluded.

 Alternatively, ""PALSY"": P, A, L, S, Y -> A is excluded -> invalid.

 How about ""SLUSH"": S, L, U, S, H -> but S repeated? And H. So: S at positions 1 and 4? But we cannot have S at position 4 because the feedback for ""moist"" marked S as present but not in the 4th position. However, if the word has two S's, then the feedback for ""moist"" only tells us that one S is not at position 4. So having S at position 4 might be allowed if there is another S? Actually, no: because the feedback for ""moist"" only shows one S (since we had one S) -> so if there were two S's in the secret word, we would have gotten two ""-"" or one ""✓"" and one ""-"", etc. But we got only one S marked as ""-"", so that means at least one S is in the word and it's not in position 4. If the secret word has two S's, then one S is not at position 4, but the other could be anywhere. However, we know that in ""moist"", only one S is present in the word? Because only one was marked. Actually, a ""-"" means that letter is in the word but not in that position, but it doesn't tell you if there are duplicates. But note: the standard Wordle behavior is that if you have duplicate letters, only the necessary number of markers are shown. However, in our rules, we haven't specified that. Since we are building this, let me clarify from the rules: The feedback symbol applies to each letter independently? But note the example: Secret word: BRISK, guess: STORM -> feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x). There is only one S in BRISK? Actually BRISK doesn't have S? Wait, the example: STORM for BRISK: S is in the word? BRISK does not have S? So let me check: secret word BRISK vs guess STORM. The S is not in BRISK? Then why is S marked as ""-""? That's a mistake? Actually, in the example: 
   Secret Word: BRISK
   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
But BRISK doesn't have S? That would be an error.

 Wait, I see: The example says:
   Secret Word: BRISK
   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

 But BRISK has the letters B, R, I, S, K. So:
   S: is in the word but not in the first position? In STORM, S is first, and in BRISK, S is fourth -> so it's present but not at position 1 -> so S(-) is correct.
   T: is not in BRISK -> T(x)
   O: not in BRISK -> O(x)
   R: in BRISK at position 2, but in STORM at position 4 -> so R(-)
   M: not in BRISK -> M(x)

 So the feedback is correct.

 Back to our case: In ""moist"", the word has one S. We got one ""-"" for S. This means the secret word has at least one S, and it is not in the 4th position. But if the secret word has two S's, then one S might be at a position we haven't guessed? That's possible. So we cannot completely rule out S at position 4? Actually, we can. Because in our guess ""moist"", we have only one S. If the secret word had two S's, then we would have gotten feedback for both? But note: the feedback might prioritize one occurrence.

 Standard Wordle feedback: 
   For duplicate letters: 
     If the guess has two of the same letter, and the word has one, then one is marked as ""-"" or ""✓"" and the other as ""x"". 
     If the word has two, and the guess has two, but only one is in the right position, then one might be ✓ and the other -. 
   But in our case, we only have one S in the guess. So we got one S marked with ""-"", meaning:
        There is at least one S in the secret word, and it is not in the fourth position.

   It does not preclude the secret word having a second S. But if it has a second S, then it could be at position 4? 
   However, if the secret word had an S at the fourth position, then in the guess ""moist"" at the fourth position (which is S) would have been marked ✓, because it would be correct. But we didn't get ✓, we got -. So that S is in the word but not at position 4. Thus, the secret word cannot have an S at position 4? Actually, yes: because if it did, then the S at position 4 in the guess would be correct and we would have gotten a ✓. So the position 4 in the secret word is not S.

   Therefore, we know for sure that the secret word has S but not at position 4, and position 4 is not S.

   Also, we don't know about other positions. But since we only have one S in the guess, if the word has two S's, that's okay, but we haven't tested the position of the second S? So we can't rule out S at other positions? Actually, the positions we haven't tested could be S? But note: we tested only position 4? In ""moist"", S was at 4. So any other position is untested.

   Therefore, in our next guess, we can put S at positions 1,2,3, or 5.

 Now, back to forming a word:

 We need a word that: 
   contains S (at least one) and places it not at position 4? Actually, we are allowed to put it anywhere except that we cannot put it at position 4? Actually, we know that position 4 is not S? Actually, we don't know about position 4 being not S? We only know that the S from our guess (which was at position 4) is not in the right place. But the secret word might have an S at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:

   The feedback told us that the S in our guess at position 4 is in the word (so the word has S) but it is not at position 4. This does not tell us anything about position 4 of the secret word? It could be any letter. It might even be another S? No, because if position 4 of the secret word was S, then our guess had S at position 4 and that would be a match (✓). We didn't get a match, so the secret word's position 4 is not S.

 Therefore, the secret word has an S, but position 4 of the secret word is not S. And our guess must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, we can put S at position 4 again, but that would be silly because we know it's not there? So we avoid that.

 And also, the secret word might have S in two positions? Then we might guess S at two positions? But currently we have no information on other positions.

 Since we want to test other letters, we might avoid putting two S's in our guess until we know more? Because we are limited by the number of letters we can test.

 Let's pick a word with one S (at first, last, or positions 2 or 3) and four other new letters.

 Given the constraints, I propose:

  ""SHULK"": but HULK? Valid? Or ""SHULK"" is not a word.

  ""SKYED"": not so common.

  ""SPLIT"": but I is excluded.

  How about ""SWAMP"": but A and M are excluded -> invalid.

  ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> that's a valid word (bulks). And S is at the end (position 5). Letters: B, U, L, K, S -> all allowed. Also, we haven't used these letters.

  Alternatively, ""FLUSH"": F, L, U, S, H -> valid? and S at position 4? But we cannot put S at position 4? Because we know position 4 of the secret is not S? So we must avoid S at position 4? Therefore, ""FLUSH"" has S at position 4 -> invalid guess? Actually, we can guess it? But we already know that position 4 is not S, so it would be wasteful? Actually, the guess must be valid 5-letter word, but it can have S at position 4? It's allowed, but we know that letter will be marked as either:
      x: if the word doesn't have a second S? 
      or -: if the word has a second S? 
   But we don't know if the word has two S's? It's risky? Maybe we can avoid it to use S in a new position.

  Better to put S in a position we haven't tested: positions 1,2,3, or 5.

  So ""BULKS"": S at position 5 -> good.

  Also, ""LUCKS"": L, U, C, K, S -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

  ""DUMPS"": D, U, M, P, S -> but M is excluded -> invalid.

  ""BUSKS"": B, U, S, K, S -> repeated S? But we are testing S again. Not ideal? But valid word? Also, we have S at positions 3 and 5.

  However, we want to test new letters. So ""BULKS"" tests B, U, L, K, and S at end.

  Another word: ""GUPSY""? Not common.

  ""SKULK"": valid? means to avoid work? We already thought of that. But it has S at position 1.

  But ""SKULK"" has two K's? And K is not excluded.

  Alternatively, ""HYPES"": H, Y, P, E, S -> E is excluded -> invalid.

  ""WISPY"": but W,I,S,P,Y -> I is excluded -> invalid.

  So ""BULKS"" seems okay? Or ""SKULK""?

  Let me check: ""SPLUG""? Not so common.

  ""SLUBS"": S, L, U, B, S -> repeated S? Valid, meaning links in a chain? But rare.

  Better to choose a more common word.

  How about ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> also repetitive? Meaning to be sulky? Valid? But we get to test U, L, K? And S at positions 1 and 5. But note: we are testing the same letter S twice? We already know S is in the word, so we might not gain much by testing two S's? We should avoid to save testing new letters.

  Therefore, without repeated S: ""BULKS"" or ""BLUSH"": BLUSH has S at position 5? Wait, B, L, U, S, H -> so S at position 4? But position 4 of the secret is not S? So we avoid S at position 4 -> ""BLUSH"" puts S at position 4 -> don't use.

  Instead, ""BUSHY"": B, U, S, H, Y -> S at position 3 -> okay. And letters B, U, S, H, Y -> all allowed.

  Is ""BUSH Y""? Actually, BUSHY is a valid word.

  So ""BUSHY"": positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y.

  Alternatively, ""PUSHY"": but P,U,S,H,Y -> similar.

  But note: we have not tried U, H, Y? They are new.

  Which word to pick? We have:

      Option 1: ""BULKS"" -> B, U, L, K, S (with S at 5)
      Option 2: ""BUSKY""? Not common.
      Option 3: ""BUSHY"" -> B, U, S, H, Y (S at 3)

  Both are valid. Let's choose the one that tests more common letters.

  Since B, U, L, K, S, H, Y are all available.

  Common letters: B, H, U, L, Y? H and L are common.

  ""BUSHY"" tests U, S, H, Y, and B? And S is at position 3. We haven't tested position 3 for S? So that's good.

  Similarly, ""BULKS"" tests U at position 2, L at 3, K at 4, S at 5? And we haven't tested positions 1,2,3,4 for letters? Actually, we did test position 4 in ""moist""? We know position 4 of the secret is not S? But we don't know what it is? So testing position 4 with a new letter K is good.

  Both seem acceptable.

  Let me lean toward ""BULKS"": because it uses L and K which are common? Or H might be more common than K? Actually, according to typical frequency, H is more common than K.

  But we want to maximize information? Actually, both are unplayed.

  Another option: ""SHYLY"" -> S at the start? But it has Y repeated? But valid word? Meaning in a shy manner? It's an adverb? Might be acceptable.

  To be safe, I'll go with ""BUSHY"": because it's a common word.

  But wait, S is at position 3? And we haven't tried S at 3? And position 4 is H? Which we haven't tested? And we know position 4 in the secret is not S? So H is a new letter? So we test H.

  Alternatively, ""BLUES"" -> but E is excluded -> invalid.

  Final decision: ""BUSHY"".

  Alternatively, a word without S? Doesn't make sense? We must include S? Because we know it's in the word? So we have to include S.

  So guess: ""bushy"".

  But note: in ""BUSHY"", the S is at position 3? We might hit if the S is at 3? But we don't know.

  Or we might get feedback that S is at a different position? Either way.

  So:

   Guess: BUSHY

   If the feedback tells us about B, U, S, H, Y.

   Especially, if S is in the word and at position 3? Then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if S is elsewhere? Then we get a - for S? But we know S is in the word? So we might get either ✓ or - at position 3? And if we get ✓, we lock position 3 is S? That would be great? But it might not be.

  Alternatively, if we put S at a new position, we can get information? We did position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 are untested? So we want to test one of them? ""BUSHY"" tests position 3? Good.

  Therefore, let's choose ""BUSHY"".

  However, note: the secret word might have S at position 1 or 2 or 5? We haven't tested them? So we might get feedback that S is present but not at position 3? Then we know it must be at 1,2, or 5? And then we have to guess again? That's okay? We have 4 more guesses? So it's acceptable.

  Alternatively, we might spread letters? But we are using 4 new letters and one we know? That's efficient.

  We'll go with ""BUSHY"".
</think>
<thinking>
Based on the feedback:

- First guess ""crane"": All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word contains none of these letters.
- Second guess ""moist"": 
  - M, O, I, T are absent → excluded.
  - S is present but in the wrong position (since marked as ""-"") → this confirms S is in the word, but not in the 4th position (as guessed in ""moist"").

Now, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word must contain S (somewhere except position 4) and use letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess:
1. Must include S but avoid position 4 to test its new potential locations (1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. Should prioritize testing common unused consonants (B, H, L) and vowels (U) from the remaining letters.
3. Avoid repeating excluded letters and reuse S strategically.

After evaluating options:
- ""BUSHY"" (B, U, S, H, Y) fits best:
  - Includes S at position 3 (untested position).
  - Tests new common letters: B, U, H, Y.
  - B and H are high-frequency consonants; U is a common vowel.
  - Valid English word (meaning overgrown with bushes).

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities for S while gathering new letter data.
</thinking>

<guess>bushy</guess>",bushy,"We are given:
- First guess ""crane"": all letters are absent (x), so the word has no C, R, A, N, E.
- Second guess ""moist"": M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). So:
  - S is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked as -).
  - M, O, I, T are NOT in the word.

 Important: Since we have S marked as ""-"", it means the secret word contains S, but not in the 4th position (because in ""moist"", S is the 4th letter).

 Also, we have now excluded the following letters: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and M, O, I, T (from second guess) -> total excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

 So the word must contain S and must not contain any of the excluded letters. Also, we know S is not in the 4th position.

 We need to make a new guess that:
 1. Includes S (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 4th position.
 2. Avoids any of the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T.
 3. Uses new letters to gain more information.

 What letters are available? We've excluded 9 letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.
 The remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: S is confirmed and must be included, so our guess must have S in one of the positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4).

 Now, we need to choose a word with S and 4 other letters from the remaining set.

 Considering common English words, we might consider using common letters from the remaining set.

 The most common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y.

 Let's try to form a word with S and some of these.

 Possible words:
 - We can try words with S at the start or end.

 Examples:
  - ""SLEEP"" but E is excluded -> invalid.
  - ""SKULL"": S at start, K, U, L, L. However, we have excluded letters? K, U, L are not excluded, but we have two L's -> but the word may have repeated letters? We don't know, but it's allowed.

 But note: we have not encountered repeated letters in feedback so far, but the secret word might have repeats.

 How about ""SLUMP""? But M is excluded -> invalid.

 Let's list possible words:

  We have to use S and avoid excluded letters.

 Some ideas:

 - ""SALAD"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
 - ""SHYLY"" -> S, H, Y, L, Y -> Y twice, and H, Y, L are available. But is SHYLY allowed? It's a valid word.

 However, we want to cover multiple common letters. Let's try:

 - ""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> two K's. Valid?
 - ""SPLIT"": but P is available, L, I (excluded) -> I is excluded, invalid.

 Since I is excluded, we can't use I.

 Another: ""SHOWY"" -> S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is excluded -> invalid.

 We are avoiding O because it's excluded.

 After excluding M,O,I,T, and first set, we must use letters from: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 Let's try to form words:

 - ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all allowed? Yes. And S is at position 1. But note: we need to avoid the 4th position for S? Our S can be anywhere except position 4. So position 1 is fine.

 However, ""SULKY"" has U, L, K, Y. Also, we don't know if U, L, K, Y are in the word.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SWUNG"": S, W, U, N, G -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

 How about ""SHULK""? Not a common word.

 ""SIGHT"": but I and G? I is excluded -> invalid.

 Another: ""SKULK"" might be acceptable? Or ""SKYED""? But less common.

 Let's consider: ""LYSSA"" -> but not 5 letters? Actually, L-Y-S-S-A -> but A is excluded.

 Alternatively, ""PALSY"": P, A, L, S, Y -> A is excluded -> invalid.

 How about ""SLUSH"": S, L, U, S, H -> but S repeated? And H. So: S at positions 1 and 4? But we cannot have S at position 4 because the feedback for ""moist"" marked S as present but not in the 4th position. However, if the word has two S's, then the feedback for ""moist"" only tells us that one S is not at position 4. So having S at position 4 might be allowed if there is another S? Actually, no: because the feedback for ""moist"" only shows one S (since we had one S) -> so if there were two S's in the secret word, we would have gotten two ""-"" or one ""✓"" and one ""-"", etc. But we got only one S marked as ""-"", so that means at least one S is in the word and it's not in position 4. If the secret word has two S's, then one S is not at position 4, but the other could be anywhere. However, we know that in ""moist"", only one S is present in the word? Because only one was marked. Actually, a ""-"" means that letter is in the word but not in that position, but it doesn't tell you if there are duplicates. But note: the standard Wordle behavior is that if you have duplicate letters, only the necessary number of markers are shown. However, in our rules, we haven't specified that. Since we are building this, let me clarify from the rules: The feedback symbol applies to each letter independently? But note the example: Secret word: BRISK, guess: STORM -> feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x). There is only one S in BRISK? Actually BRISK doesn't have S? Wait, the example: STORM for BRISK: S is in the word? BRISK does not have S? So let me check: secret word BRISK vs guess STORM. The S is not in BRISK? Then why is S marked as ""-""? That's a mistake? Actually, in the example: 
   Secret Word: BRISK
   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
But BRISK doesn't have S? That would be an error.

 Wait, I see: The example says:
   Secret Word: BRISK
   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

 But BRISK has the letters B, R, I, S, K. So:
   S: is in the word but not in the first position? In STORM, S is first, and in BRISK, S is fourth -> so it's present but not at position 1 -> so S(-) is correct.
   T: is not in BRISK -> T(x)
   O: not in BRISK -> O(x)
   R: in BRISK at position 2, but in STORM at position 4 -> so R(-)
   M: not in BRISK -> M(x)

 So the feedback is correct.

 Back to our case: In ""moist"", the word has one S. We got one ""-"" for S. This means the secret word has at least one S, and it is not in the 4th position. But if the secret word has two S's, then one S might be at a position we haven't guessed? That's possible. So we cannot completely rule out S at position 4? Actually, we can. Because in our guess ""moist"", we have only one S. If the secret word had two S's, then we would have gotten feedback for both? But note: the feedback might prioritize one occurrence.

 Standard Wordle feedback: 
   For duplicate letters: 
     If the guess has two of the same letter, and the word has one, then one is marked as ""-"" or ""✓"" and the other as ""x"". 
     If the word has two, and the guess has two, but only one is in the right position, then one might be ✓ and the other -. 
   But in our case, we only have one S in the guess. So we got one S marked with ""-"", meaning:
        There is at least one S in the secret word, and it is not in the fourth position.

   It does not preclude the secret word having a second S. But if it has a second S, then it could be at position 4? 
   However, if the secret word had an S at the fourth position, then in the guess ""moist"" at the fourth position (which is S) would have been marked ✓, because it would be correct. But we didn't get ✓, we got -. So that S is in the word but not at position 4. Thus, the secret word cannot have an S at position 4? Actually, yes: because if it did, then the S at position 4 in the guess would be correct and we would have gotten a ✓. So the position 4 in the secret word is not S.

   Therefore, we know for sure that the secret word has S but not at position 4, and position 4 is not S.

   Also, we don't know about other positions. But since we only have one S in the guess, if the word has two S's, that's okay, but we haven't tested the position of the second S? So we can't rule out S at other positions? Actually, the positions we haven't tested could be S? But note: we tested only position 4? In ""moist"", S was at 4. So any other position is untested.

   Therefore, in our next guess, we can put S at positions 1,2,3, or 5.

 Now, back to forming a word:

 We need a word that: 
   contains S (at least one) and places it not at position 4? Actually, we are allowed to put it anywhere except that we cannot put it at position 4? Actually, we know that position 4 is not S? Actually, we don't know about position 4 being not S? We only know that the S from our guess (which was at position 4) is not in the right place. But the secret word might have an S at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:

   The feedback told us that the S in our guess at position 4 is in the word (so the word has S) but it is not at position 4. This does not tell us anything about position 4 of the secret word? It could be any letter. It might even be another S? No, because if position 4 of the secret word was S, then our guess had S at position 4 and that would be a match (✓). We didn't get a match, so the secret word's position 4 is not S.

 Therefore, the secret word has an S, but position 4 of the secret word is not S. And our guess must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, we can put S at position 4 again, but that would be silly because we know it's not there? So we avoid that.

 And also, the secret word might have S in two positions? Then we might guess S at two positions? But currently we have no information on other positions.

 Since we want to test other letters, we might avoid putting two S's in our guess until we know more? Because we are limited by the number of letters we can test.

 Let's pick a word with one S (at first, last, or positions 2 or 3) and four other new letters.

 Given the constraints, I propose:

  ""SHULK"": but HULK? Valid? Or ""SHULK"" is not a word.

  ""SKYED"": not so common.

  ""SPLIT"": but I is excluded.

  How about ""SWAMP"": but A and M are excluded -> invalid.

  ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> that's a valid word (bulks). And S is at the end (position 5). Letters: B, U, L, K, S -> all allowed. Also, we haven't used these letters.

  Alternatively, ""FLUSH"": F, L, U, S, H -> valid? and S at position 4? But we cannot put S at position 4? Because we know position 4 of the secret is not S? So we must avoid S at position 4? Therefore, ""FLUSH"" has S at position 4 -> invalid guess? Actually, we can guess it? But we already know that position 4 is not S, so it would be wasteful? Actually, the guess must be valid 5-letter word, but it can have S at position 4? It's allowed, but we know that letter will be marked as either:
      x: if the word doesn't have a second S? 
      or -: if the word has a second S? 
   But we don't know if the word has two S's? It's risky? Maybe we can avoid it to use S in a new position.

  Better to put S in a position we haven't tested: positions 1,2,3, or 5.

  So ""BULKS"": S at position 5 -> good.

  Also, ""LUCKS"": L, U, C, K, S -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

  ""DUMPS"": D, U, M, P, S -> but M is excluded -> invalid.

  ""BUSKS"": B, U, S, K, S -> repeated S? But we are testing S again. Not ideal? But valid word? Also, we have S at positions 3 and 5.

  However, we want to test new letters. So ""BULKS"" tests B, U, L, K, and S at end.

  Another word: ""GUPSY""? Not common.

  ""SKULK"": valid? means to avoid work? We already thought of that. But it has S at position 1.

  But ""SKULK"" has two K's? And K is not excluded.

  Alternatively, ""HYPES"": H, Y, P, E, S -> E is excluded -> invalid.

  ""WISPY"": but W,I,S,P,Y -> I is excluded -> invalid.

  So ""BULKS"" seems okay? Or ""SKULK""?

  Let me check: ""SPLUG""? Not so common.

  ""SLUBS"": S, L, U, B, S -> repeated S? Valid, meaning links in a chain? But rare.

  Better to choose a more common word.

  How about ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> also repetitive? Meaning to be sulky? Valid? But we get to test U, L, K? And S at positions 1 and 5. But note: we are testing the same letter S twice? We already know S is in the word, so we might not gain much by testing two S's? We should avoid to save testing new letters.

  Therefore, without repeated S: ""BULKS"" or ""BLUSH"": BLUSH has S at position 5? Wait, B, L, U, S, H -> so S at position 4? But position 4 of the secret is not S? So we avoid S at position 4 -> ""BLUSH"" puts S at position 4 -> don't use.

  Instead, ""BUSHY"": B, U, S, H, Y -> S at position 3 -> okay. And letters B, U, S, H, Y -> all allowed.

  Is ""BUSH Y""? Actually, BUSHY is a valid word.

  So ""BUSHY"": positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y.

  Alternatively, ""PUSHY"": but P,U,S,H,Y -> similar.

  But note: we have not tried U, H, Y? They are new.

  Which word to pick? We have:

      Option 1: ""BULKS"" -> B, U, L, K, S (with S at 5)
      Option 2: ""BUSKY""? Not common.
      Option 3: ""BUSHY"" -> B, U, S, H, Y (S at 3)

  Both are valid. Let's choose the one that tests more common letters.

  Since B, U, L, K, S, H, Y are all available.

  Common letters: B, H, U, L, Y? H and L are common.

  ""BUSHY"" tests U, S, H, Y, and B? And S is at position 3. We haven't tested position 3 for S? So that's good.

  Similarly, ""BULKS"" tests U at position 2, L at 3, K at 4, S at 5? And we haven't tested positions 1,2,3,4 for letters? Actually, we did test position 4 in ""moist""? We know position 4 of the secret is not S? But we don't know what it is? So testing position 4 with a new letter K is good.

  Both seem acceptable.

  Let me lean toward ""BULKS"": because it uses L and K which are common? Or H might be more common than K? Actually, according to typical frequency, H is more common than K.

  But we want to maximize information? Actually, both are unplayed.

  Another option: ""SHYLY"" -> S at the start? But it has Y repeated? But valid word? Meaning in a shy manner? It's an adverb? Might be acceptable.

  To be safe, I'll go with ""BUSHY"": because it's a common word.

  But wait, S is at position 3? And we haven't tried S at 3? And position 4 is H? Which we haven't tested? And we know position 4 in the secret is not S? So H is a new letter? So we test H.

  Alternatively, ""BLUES"" -> but E is excluded -> invalid.

  Final decision: ""BUSHY"".

  Alternatively, a word without S? Doesn't make sense? We must include S? Because we know it's in the word? So we have to include S.

  So guess: ""bushy"".

  But note: in ""BUSHY"", the S is at position 3? We might hit if the S is at 3? But we don't know.

  Or we might get feedback that S is at a different position? Either way.

  So:

   Guess: BUSHY

   If the feedback tells us about B, U, S, H, Y.

   Especially, if S is in the word and at position 3? Then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if S is elsewhere? Then we get a - for S? But we know S is in the word? So we might get either ✓ or - at position 3? And if we get ✓, we lock position 3 is S? That would be great? But it might not be.

  Alternatively, if we put S at a new position, we can get information? We did position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 are untested? So we want to test one of them? ""BUSHY"" tests position 3? Good.

  Therefore, let's choose ""BUSHY"".

  However, note: the secret word might have S at position 1 or 2 or 5? We haven't tested them? So we might get feedback that S is present but not at position 3? Then we know it must be at 1,2, or 5? And then we have to guess again? That's okay? We have 4 more guesses? So it's acceptable.

  Alternatively, we might spread letters? But we are using 4 new letters and one we know? That's efficient.

  We'll go with ""BUSHY"".<thinking>
Based on the feedback:

- First guess ""crane"": All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word contains none of these letters.
- Second guess ""moist"": 
  - M, O, I, T are absent → excluded.
  - S is present but in the wrong position (since marked as ""-"") → this confirms S is in the word, but not in the 4th position (as guessed in ""moist"").

Now, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word must contain S (somewhere except position 4) and use letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess:
1. Must include S but avoid position 4 to test its new potential locations (1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. Should prioritize testing common unused consonants (B, H, L) and vowels (U) from the remaining letters.
3. Avoid repeating excluded letters and reuse S strategically.

After evaluating options:
- ""BUSHY"" (B, U, S, H, Y) fits best:
  - Includes S at position 3 (untested position).
  - Tests new common letters: B, U, H, Y.
  - B and H are high-frequency consonants; U is a common vowel.
  - Valid English word (meaning overgrown with bushes).

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities for S while gathering new letter data.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,sully,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no information yet, so we should choose a word that can give us a lot of information.
 A good starting word often has common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information gain.
 Common starting words in Wordle are like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let me pick one.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A balanced word like ""CRANE"" is effective because:
- It includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- The letters (C, R, A, N, E) frequently appear in English words, helping identify correct letters/positions quickly.
This sets a strong foundation for subsequent guesses based on feedback.
</thinking>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback that for the first guess ""crane"", all letters are incorrect (x). 
 This means that the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Therefore, we must choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these letters.

 We need to pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E) might include: 
   S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

 A good starting point might be a word like ""SLOTH"" or ""PILOT"", but let's think of one that avoids the excluded letters.

 Since we have excluded 5 letters, we have a lot of the alphabet left.

 Let's consider: 
   S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, W, F, K, V, etc.

 We can try a word that has common letters we haven't tried yet.

 Example: ""SLIMY"" -> but let's check: S, L, I, M, Y. None of these are in the excluded set (C,R,A,N,E). 

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T -> but N is excluded (we got x for N in the first guess). So we cannot use N.

 We must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Another idea: ""LIGHT"" -> L, I, G, H, T. All these are not excluded.

 But we might want to cover more common letters. Let's try ""TOILS"" or ""STOMP"".

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me list some common letters we haven't used: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, V, W, X, Z (but X and Z are less common).

 We can try a word that uses 5 of the most common remaining letters.

 According to letter frequency in English, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common are: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H.

 We can try: ""SIGHT"" -> S, I, G, H, T. This covers S, I, G, H, T.

 Another option: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T. This covers M, O, I, S, T.

 ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has common letters and we haven't tried any of them.

 Alternatively, ""PLUMB"" but that has B which is less common and we might not get as much information.

 Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 So the next guess: ""moist""<thinking>
The feedback for ""crane"" showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word must consist entirely of letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, A, N, E). 

To maximize information gain, I should choose a new word that:
1. Uses 5 entirely new, high-frequency English letters not yet tested.
2. Avoids repeating the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).
3. Prioritizes common consonants and vowels from the remaining set.

The most frequent remaining letters in English 5-letter words are: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, V, W. 

A strong candidate is **""MOIST""** because:
- It uses 5 common letters: M, O, I, S, T.
- All letters are distinct, increasing coverage.
- It includes the vowel O and I, plus high-frequency consonants (S, T, M).
- No overlap with excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities based on the feedback for M, O, I, S, and T.
</thinking>

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given:
- First guess ""crane"": all letters are absent (x), so the word has no C, R, A, N, E.
- Second guess ""moist"": M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). So:
  - S is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked as -).
  - M, O, I, T are NOT in the word.

 Important: Since we have S marked as ""-"", it means the secret word contains S, but not in the 4th position (because in ""moist"", S is the 4th letter).

 Also, we have now excluded the following letters: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and M, O, I, T (from second guess) -> total excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

 So the word must contain S and must not contain any of the excluded letters. Also, we know S is not in the 4th position.

 We need to make a new guess that:
 1. Includes S (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 4th position.
 2. Avoids any of the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T.
 3. Uses new letters to gain more information.

 What letters are available? We've excluded 9 letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.
 The remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: S is confirmed and must be included, so our guess must have S in one of the positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4).

 Now, we need to choose a word with S and 4 other letters from the remaining set.

 Considering common English words, we might consider using common letters from the remaining set.

 The most common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y.

 Let's try to form a word with S and some of these.

 Possible words:
 - We can try words with S at the start or end.

 Examples:
  - ""SLEEP"" but E is excluded -> invalid.
  - ""SKULL"": S at start, K, U, L, L. However, we have excluded letters? K, U, L are not excluded, but we have two L's -> but the word may have repeated letters? We don't know, but it's allowed.

 But note: we have not encountered repeated letters in feedback so far, but the secret word might have repeats.

 How about ""SLUMP""? But M is excluded -> invalid.

 Let's list possible words:

  We have to use S and avoid excluded letters.

 Some ideas:

 - ""SALAD"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
 - ""SHYLY"" -> S, H, Y, L, Y -> Y twice, and H, Y, L are available. But is SHYLY allowed? It's a valid word.

 However, we want to cover multiple common letters. Let's try:

 - ""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> two K's. Valid?
 - ""SPLIT"": but P is available, L, I (excluded) -> I is excluded, invalid.

 Since I is excluded, we can't use I.

 Another: ""SHOWY"" -> S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is excluded -> invalid.

 We are avoiding O because it's excluded.

 After excluding M,O,I,T, and first set, we must use letters from: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 Let's try to form words:

 - ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all allowed? Yes. And S is at position 1. But note: we need to avoid the 4th position for S? Our S can be anywhere except position 4. So position 1 is fine.

 However, ""SULKY"" has U, L, K, Y. Also, we don't know if U, L, K, Y are in the word.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SWUNG"": S, W, U, N, G -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

 How about ""SHULK""? Not a common word.

 ""SIGHT"": but I and G? I is excluded -> invalid.

 Another: ""SKULK"" might be acceptable? Or ""SKYED""? But less common.

 Let's consider: ""LYSSA"" -> but not 5 letters? Actually, L-Y-S-S-A -> but A is excluded.

 Alternatively, ""PALSY"": P, A, L, S, Y -> A is excluded -> invalid.

 How about ""SLUSH"": S, L, U, S, H -> but S repeated? And H. So: S at positions 1 and 4? But we cannot have S at position 4 because the feedback for ""moist"" marked S as present but not in the 4th position. However, if the word has two S's, then the feedback for ""moist"" only tells us that one S is not at position 4. So having S at position 4 might be allowed if there is another S? Actually, no: because the feedback for ""moist"" only shows one S (since we had one S) -> so if there were two S's in the secret word, we would have gotten two ""-"" or one ""✓"" and one ""-"", etc. But we got only one S marked as ""-"", so that means at least one S is in the word and it's not in position 4. If the secret word has two S's, then one S is not at position 4, but the other could be anywhere. However, we know that in ""moist"", only one S is present in the word? Because only one was marked. Actually, a ""-"" means that letter is in the word but not in that position, but it doesn't tell you if there are duplicates. But note: the standard Wordle behavior is that if you have duplicate letters, only the necessary number of markers are shown. However, in our rules, we haven't specified that. Since we are building this, let me clarify from the rules: The feedback symbol applies to each letter independently? But note the example: Secret word: BRISK, guess: STORM -> feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x). There is only one S in BRISK? Actually BRISK doesn't have S? Wait, the example: STORM for BRISK: S is in the word? BRISK does not have S? So let me check: secret word BRISK vs guess STORM. The S is not in BRISK? Then why is S marked as ""-""? That's a mistake? Actually, in the example: 
   Secret Word: BRISK
   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
But BRISK doesn't have S? That would be an error.

 Wait, I see: The example says:
   Secret Word: BRISK
   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

 But BRISK has the letters B, R, I, S, K. So:
   S: is in the word but not in the first position? In STORM, S is first, and in BRISK, S is fourth -> so it's present but not at position 1 -> so S(-) is correct.
   T: is not in BRISK -> T(x)
   O: not in BRISK -> O(x)
   R: in BRISK at position 2, but in STORM at position 4 -> so R(-)
   M: not in BRISK -> M(x)

 So the feedback is correct.

 Back to our case: In ""moist"", the word has one S. We got one ""-"" for S. This means the secret word has at least one S, and it is not in the 4th position. But if the secret word has two S's, then one S might be at a position we haven't guessed? That's possible. So we cannot completely rule out S at position 4? Actually, we can. Because in our guess ""moist"", we have only one S. If the secret word had two S's, then we would have gotten feedback for both? But note: the feedback might prioritize one occurrence.

 Standard Wordle feedback: 
   For duplicate letters: 
     If the guess has two of the same letter, and the word has one, then one is marked as ""-"" or ""✓"" and the other as ""x"". 
     If the word has two, and the guess has two, but only one is in the right position, then one might be ✓ and the other -. 
   But in our case, we only have one S in the guess. So we got one S marked with ""-"", meaning:
        There is at least one S in the secret word, and it is not in the fourth position.

   It does not preclude the secret word having a second S. But if it has a second S, then it could be at position 4? 
   However, if the secret word had an S at the fourth position, then in the guess ""moist"" at the fourth position (which is S) would have been marked ✓, because it would be correct. But we didn't get ✓, we got -. So that S is in the word but not at position 4. Thus, the secret word cannot have an S at position 4? Actually, yes: because if it did, then the S at position 4 in the guess would be correct and we would have gotten a ✓. So the position 4 in the secret word is not S.

   Therefore, we know for sure that the secret word has S but not at position 4, and position 4 is not S.

   Also, we don't know about other positions. But since we only have one S in the guess, if the word has two S's, that's okay, but we haven't tested the position of the second S? So we can't rule out S at other positions? Actually, the positions we haven't tested could be S? But note: we tested only position 4? In ""moist"", S was at 4. So any other position is untested.

   Therefore, in our next guess, we can put S at positions 1,2,3, or 5.

 Now, back to forming a word:

 We need a word that: 
   contains S (at least one) and places it not at position 4? Actually, we are allowed to put it anywhere except that we cannot put it at position 4? Actually, we know that position 4 is not S? Actually, we don't know about position 4 being not S? We only know that the S from our guess (which was at position 4) is not in the right place. But the secret word might have an S at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:

   The feedback told us that the S in our guess at position 4 is in the word (so the word has S) but it is not at position 4. This does not tell us anything about position 4 of the secret word? It could be any letter. It might even be another S? No, because if position 4 of the secret word was S, then our guess had S at position 4 and that would be a match (✓). We didn't get a match, so the secret word's position 4 is not S.

 Therefore, the secret word has an S, but position 4 of the secret word is not S. And our guess must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, we can put S at position 4 again, but that would be silly because we know it's not there? So we avoid that.

 And also, the secret word might have S in two positions? Then we might guess S at two positions? But currently we have no information on other positions.

 Since we want to test other letters, we might avoid putting two S's in our guess until we know more? Because we are limited by the number of letters we can test.

 Let's pick a word with one S (at first, last, or positions 2 or 3) and four other new letters.

 Given the constraints, I propose:

  ""SHULK"": but HULK? Valid? Or ""SHULK"" is not a word.

  ""SKYED"": not so common.

  ""SPLIT"": but I is excluded.

  How about ""SWAMP"": but A and M are excluded -> invalid.

  ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> that's a valid word (bulks). And S is at the end (position 5). Letters: B, U, L, K, S -> all allowed. Also, we haven't used these letters.

  Alternatively, ""FLUSH"": F, L, U, S, H -> valid? and S at position 4? But we cannot put S at position 4? Because we know position 4 of the secret is not S? So we must avoid S at position 4? Therefore, ""FLUSH"" has S at position 4 -> invalid guess? Actually, we can guess it? But we already know that position 4 is not S, so it would be wasteful? Actually, the guess must be valid 5-letter word, but it can have S at position 4? It's allowed, but we know that letter will be marked as either:
      x: if the word doesn't have a second S? 
      or -: if the word has a second S? 
   But we don't know if the word has two S's? It's risky? Maybe we can avoid it to use S in a new position.

  Better to put S in a position we haven't tested: positions 1,2,3, or 5.

  So ""BULKS"": S at position 5 -> good.

  Also, ""LUCKS"": L, U, C, K, S -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

  ""DUMPS"": D, U, M, P, S -> but M is excluded -> invalid.

  ""BUSKS"": B, U, S, K, S -> repeated S? But we are testing S again. Not ideal? But valid word? Also, we have S at positions 3 and 5.

  However, we want to test new letters. So ""BULKS"" tests B, U, L, K, and S at end.

  Another word: ""GUPSY""? Not common.

  ""SKULK"": valid? means to avoid work? We already thought of that. But it has S at position 1.

  But ""SKULK"" has two K's? And K is not excluded.

  Alternatively, ""HYPES"": H, Y, P, E, S -> E is excluded -> invalid.

  ""WISPY"": but W,I,S,P,Y -> I is excluded -> invalid.

  So ""BULKS"" seems okay? Or ""SKULK""?

  Let me check: ""SPLUG""? Not so common.

  ""SLUBS"": S, L, U, B, S -> repeated S? Valid, meaning links in a chain? But rare.

  Better to choose a more common word.

  How about ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> also repetitive? Meaning to be sulky? Valid? But we get to test U, L, K? And S at positions 1 and 5. But note: we are testing the same letter S twice? We already know S is in the word, so we might not gain much by testing two S's? We should avoid to save testing new letters.

  Therefore, without repeated S: ""BULKS"" or ""BLUSH"": BLUSH has S at position 5? Wait, B, L, U, S, H -> so S at position 4? But position 4 of the secret is not S? So we avoid S at position 4 -> ""BLUSH"" puts S at position 4 -> don't use.

  Instead, ""BUSHY"": B, U, S, H, Y -> S at position 3 -> okay. And letters B, U, S, H, Y -> all allowed.

  Is ""BUSH Y""? Actually, BUSHY is a valid word.

  So ""BUSHY"": positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y.

  Alternatively, ""PUSHY"": but P,U,S,H,Y -> similar.

  But note: we have not tried U, H, Y? They are new.

  Which word to pick? We have:

      Option 1: ""BULKS"" -> B, U, L, K, S (with S at 5)
      Option 2: ""BUSKY""? Not common.
      Option 3: ""BUSHY"" -> B, U, S, H, Y (S at 3)

  Both are valid. Let's choose the one that tests more common letters.

  Since B, U, L, K, S, H, Y are all available.

  Common letters: B, H, U, L, Y? H and L are common.

  ""BUSHY"" tests U, S, H, Y, and B? And S is at position 3. We haven't tested position 3 for S? So that's good.

  Similarly, ""BULKS"" tests U at position 2, L at 3, K at 4, S at 5? And we haven't tested positions 1,2,3,4 for letters? Actually, we did test position 4 in ""moist""? We know position 4 of the secret is not S? But we don't know what it is? So testing position 4 with a new letter K is good.

  Both seem acceptable.

  Let me lean toward ""BULKS"": because it uses L and K which are common? Or H might be more common than K? Actually, according to typical frequency, H is more common than K.

  But we want to maximize information? Actually, both are unplayed.

  Another option: ""SHYLY"" -> S at the start? But it has Y repeated? But valid word? Meaning in a shy manner? It's an adverb? Might be acceptable.

  To be safe, I'll go with ""BUSHY"": because it's a common word.

  But wait, S is at position 3? And we haven't tried S at 3? And position 4 is H? Which we haven't tested? And we know position 4 in the secret is not S? So H is a new letter? So we test H.

  Alternatively, ""BLUES"" -> but E is excluded -> invalid.

  Final decision: ""BUSHY"".

  Alternatively, a word without S? Doesn't make sense? We must include S? Because we know it's in the word? So we have to include S.

  So guess: ""bushy"".

  But note: in ""BUSHY"", the S is at position 3? We might hit if the S is at 3? But we don't know.

  Or we might get feedback that S is at a different position? Either way.

  So:

   Guess: BUSHY

   If the feedback tells us about B, U, S, H, Y.

   Especially, if S is in the word and at position 3? Then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if S is elsewhere? Then we get a - for S? But we know S is in the word? So we might get either ✓ or - at position 3? And if we get ✓, we lock position 3 is S? That would be great? But it might not be.

  Alternatively, if we put S at a new position, we can get information? We did position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 are untested? So we want to test one of them? ""BUSHY"" tests position 3? Good.

  Therefore, let's choose ""BUSHY"".

  However, note: the secret word might have S at position 1 or 2 or 5? We haven't tested them? So we might get feedback that S is present but not at position 3? Then we know it must be at 1,2, or 5? And then we have to guess again? That's okay? We have 4 more guesses? So it's acceptable.

  Alternatively, we might spread letters? But we are using 4 new letters and one we know? That's efficient.

  We'll go with ""BUSHY"".<thinking>
Based on the feedback:

- First guess ""crane"": All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word contains none of these letters.
- Second guess ""moist"": 
  - M, O, I, T are absent → excluded.
  - S is present but in the wrong position (since marked as ""-"") → this confirms S is in the word, but not in the 4th position (as guessed in ""moist"").

Now, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word must contain S (somewhere except position 4) and use letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess:
1. Must include S but avoid position 4 to test its new potential locations (1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. Should prioritize testing common unused consonants (B, H, L) and vowels (U) from the remaining letters.
3. Avoid repeating excluded letters and reuse S strategically.

After evaluating options:
- ""BUSHY"" (B, U, S, H, Y) fits best:
  - Includes S at position 3 (untested position).
  - Tests new common letters: B, U, H, Y.
  - B and H are high-frequency consonants; U is a common vowel.
  - Valid English word (meaning overgrown with bushes).

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities for S while gathering new letter data.

However, we have excluded letters? K, U, L are not excluded, but we have two L\'s -> but the word may have repeated letters? We don\'t know, but it\'s allowed.\n\n But note: we have not encountered repeated letters in feedback so far, but the secret word might have repeats.\n\n How about ""SLUMP""? But M is excluded -> invalid.\n\n Let\'s list possible words:\n\n  We have to use S and avoid excluded letters.\n\n Some ideas:\n\n - ""SALAD"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n - ""SHYLY"" -> S, H, Y, L, Y -> Y twice, and H, Y, L are available. But is SHYLY allowed? It\'s a valid word.\n\n However, we want to cover multiple common letters. Let\'s try:\n\n - ""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> two K\'s. Valid?\n - ""SPLIT"": but P is available, L, I (excluded) -> I is excluded, invalid.\n\n Since I is excluded, we can\'t use I.\n\n Another: ""SHOWY"" -> S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is excluded -> invalid.\n\n We are avoiding O because it\'s excluded.\n\n After excluding M,O,I,T, and first set, we must use letters from: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n Let\'s try to form words:\n\n - ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all allowed? Yes. And S is at position 1. But note: we need to avoid the 4th position for S? Our S can be anywhere except position 4. So position 1 is fine.\n\n However, ""SULKY"" has U, L, K, Y. Also, we don\'t know if U, L, K, Y are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""SWUNG"": S, W, U, N, G -> but N is excluded -> invalid.\n\n How about ""SHULK""? Not a common word.\n\n ""SIGHT"": but I and G? I is excluded -> invalid.\n\n Another: ""SKULK"" might be acceptable? Or ""SKYED""? But less common.\n\n Let\'s consider: ""LYSSA"" -> but not 5 letters? Actually, L-Y-S-S-A -> but A is excluded.\n\n Alternatively, ""PALSY"": P, A, L, S, Y -> A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n How about ""SLUSH"": S, L, U, S, H -> but S repeated? And H. So: S at positions 1 and 4? But we cannot have S at position 4 because the feedback for ""moist"" marked S as present but not in the 4th position. However, if the word has two S\'s, then the feedback for ""moist"" only tells us that one S is not at position 4. So having S at position 4 might be allowed if there is another S? Actually, no: because the feedback for ""moist"" only shows one S (since we had one S) -> so if there were two S\'s in the secret word, we would have gotten two ""-"" or one ""✓"" and one ""-"", etc. But we got only one S marked as ""-"", so that means at least one S is in the word and it\'s not in position 4. If the secret word has two S\'s, then one S is not at position 4, but the other could be anywhere. However, we know that in ""moist"", only one S is present in the word? Because only one was marked. Actually, a ""-"" means that letter is in the word but not in that position, but it doesn\'t tell you if there are duplicates. But note: the standard Wordle behavior is that if you have duplicate letters, only the necessary number of markers are shown. However, in our rules, we haven\'t specified that. Since we are building this, let me clarify from the rules: The feedback symbol applies to each letter independently? But note the example: Secret word: BRISK, guess: STORM -> feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x). There is only one S in BRISK? Actually BRISK doesn\'t have S? Wait, the example: STORM for BRISK: S is in the word? BRISK does not have S? So let me check: secret word BRISK vs guess STORM. The S is not in BRISK? Then why is S marked as ""-""? That\'s a mistake? Actually, in the example: \n   Secret Word: BRISK\n   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)\nBut BRISK doesn\'t have S? That would be an error.\n\n Wait, I see: The example says:\n   Secret Word: BRISK\n   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)\n\n But BRISK has the letters B, R, I, S, K. So:\n   S: is in the word but not in the first position? In STORM, S is first, and in BRISK, S is fourth -> so it\'s present but not at position 1 -> so S(-) is correct.\n   T: is not in BRISK -> T(x)\n   O: not in BRISK -> O(x)\n   R: in BRISK at position 2, but in STORM at position 4 -> so R(-)\n   M: not in BRISK -> M(x)\n\n So the feedback is correct.\n\n Back to our case: In ""moist"", the word has one S. We got one ""-"" for S. This means the secret word has at least one S, and it is not in the 4th position. But if the secret word has two S\'s, then one S might be at a position we haven\'t guessed? That\'s possible. So we cannot completely rule out S at position 4? Actually, we can. Because in our guess ""moist"", we have only one S. If the secret word had two S\'s, then we would have gotten feedback for both? But note: the feedback might prioritize one occurrence.\n\n Standard Wordle feedback: \n   For duplicate letters: \n     If the guess has two of the same letter, and the word has one, then one is marked as ""-"" or ""✓"" and the other as ""x"". \n     If the word has two, and the guess has two, but only one is in the right position, then one might be ✓ and the other -. \n   But in our case, we only have one S in the guess. So we got one S marked with ""-"", meaning:\n        There is at least one S in the secret word, and it is not in the fourth position.\n\n   It does not preclude the secret word having a second S. But if it has a second S, then it could be at position 4? \n   However, if the secret word had an S at the fourth position, then in the guess ""moist"" at the fourth position (which is S) would have been marked ✓, because it would be correct. But we didn\'t get ✓, we got -. So that S is in the word but not at position 4. Thus, the secret word cannot have an S at position 4? Actually, yes: because if it did, then the S at position 4 in the guess would be correct and we would have gotten a ✓. So the position 4 in the secret word is not S.\n\n   Therefore, we know for sure that the secret word has S but not at position 4, and position 4 is not S.\n\n   Also, we don\'t know about other positions. But since we only have one S in the guess, if the word has two S\'s, that\'s okay, but we haven\'t tested the position of the second S? So we can\'t rule out S at other positions? Actually, the positions we haven\'t tested could be S? But note: we tested only position 4? In ""moist"", S was at 4. So any other position is untested.\n\n   Therefore, in our next guess, we can put S at positions 1,2,3, or 5.\n\n Now, back to forming a word:\n\n We need a word that: \n   contains S (at least one) and places it not at position 4? Actually, we are allowed to put it anywhere except that we cannot put it at position 4? Actually, we know that position 4 is not S? Actually, we don\'t know about position 4 being not S? We only know that the S from our guess (which was at position 4) is not in the right place. But the secret word might have an S at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:\n\n   The feedback told us that the S in our guess at position 4 is in the word (so the word has S) but it is not at position 4. This does not tell us anything about position 4 of the secret word? It could be any letter. It might even be another S? No, because if position 4 of the secret word was S, then our guess had S at position 4 and that would be a match (✓). We didn\'t get a match, so the secret word\'s position 4 is not S.\n\n Therefore, the secret word has an S, but position 4 of the secret word is not S. And our guess must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, we can put S at position 4 again, but that would be silly because we know it\'s not there? So we avoid that.\n\n And also, the secret word might have S in two positions? Then we might guess S at two positions? But currently we have no information on other positions.\n\n Since we want to test other letters, we might avoid putting two S\'s in our guess until we know more? Because we are limited by the number of letters we can test.\n\n Let\'s pick a word with one S (at first, last, or positions 2 or 3) and four other new letters.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n  ""SHULK"": but HULK? Valid? Or ""SHULK"" is not a word.\n\n  ""SKYED"": not so common.\n\n  ""SPLIT"": but I is excluded.\n\n  How about ""SWAMP"": but A and M are excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> that\'s a valid word (bulks). And S is at the end (position 5). Letters: B, U, L, K, S -> all allowed. Also, we haven\'t used these letters.\n\n  Alternatively, ""FLUSH"": F, L, U, S, H -> valid? and S at position 4? But we cannot put S at position 4? Because we know position 4 of the secret is not S? So we must avoid S at position 4? Therefore, ""FLUSH"" has S at position 4 -> invalid guess? Actually, we can guess it? But we already know that position 4 is not S, so it would be wasteful? Actually, the guess must be valid 5-letter word, but it can have S at position 4? It\'s allowed, but we know that letter will be marked as either:\n      x: if the word doesn\'t have a second S? \n      or -: if the word has a second S? \n   But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s? It\'s risky? Maybe we can avoid it to use S in a new position.\n\n  Better to put S in a position we haven\'t tested: positions 1,2,3, or 5.\n\n  So ""BULKS"": S at position 5 -> good.\n\n  Also, ""LUCKS"": L, U, C, K, S -> but C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""DUMPS"": D, U, M, P, S -> but M is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BUSKS"": B, U, S, K, S -> repeated S? But we are testing S again. Not ideal? But valid word? Also, we have S at positions 3 and 5.\n\n  However, we want to test new letters. So ""BULKS"" tests B, U, L, K, and S at end.\n\n  Another word: ""GUPSY""? Not common.\n\n  ""SKULK"": valid? means to avoid work? We already thought of that. But it has S at position 1.\n\n  But ""SKULK"" has two K\'s? And K is not excluded.\n\n  Alternatively, ""HYPES"": H, Y, P, E, S -> E is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""WISPY"": but W,I,S,P,Y -> I is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  So ""BULKS"" seems okay? Or ""SKULK""?\n\n  Let me check: ""SPLUG""? Not so common.\n\n  ""SLUBS"": S, L, U, B, S -> repeated S? Valid, meaning links in a chain? But rare.\n\n  Better to choose a more common word.\n\n  How about ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> also repetitive? Meaning to be sulky? Valid? But we get to test U, L, K? And S at positions 1 and 5. But note: we are testing the same letter S twice? We already know S is in the word, so we might not gain much by testing two S\'s? We should avoid to save testing new letters.\n\n  Therefore, without repeated S: ""BULKS"" or ""BLUSH"": BLUSH has S at position 5? Wait, B, L, U, S, H -> so S at position 4? But position 4 of the secret is not S? So we avoid S at position 4 -> ""BLUSH"" puts S at position 4 -> don\'t use.\n\n  Instead, ""BUSHY"": B, U, S, H, Y -> S at position 3 -> okay. And letters B, U, S, H, Y -> all allowed.\n\n  Is ""BUSH Y""? Actually, BUSHY is a valid word.\n\n  So ""BUSHY"": positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y.\n\n  Alternatively, ""PUSHY"": but P,U,S,H,Y -> similar.\n\n  But note: we have not tried U, H, Y? They are new.\n\n  Which word to pick? We have:\n\n      Option 1: ""BULKS"" -> B, U, L, K, S (with S at 5)\n      Option 2: ""BUSKY""? Not common.\n      Option 3: ""BUSHY"" -> B, U, S, H, Y (S at 3)\n\n  Both are valid. Let\'s choose the one that tests more common letters.\n\n  Since B, U, L, K, S, H, Y are all available.\n\n  Common letters: B, H, U, L, Y? H and L are common.\n\n  ""BUSHY"" tests U, S, H, Y, and B? And S is at position 3. We haven\'t tested position 3 for S? So that\'s good.\n\n  Similarly, ""BULKS"" tests U at position 2, L at 3, K at 4, S at 5? And we haven\'t tested positions 1,2,3,4 for letters? Actually, we did test position 4 in ""moist""? We know position 4 of the secret is not S? But we don\'t know what it is? So testing position 4 with a new letter K is good.\n\n  Both seem acceptable.\n\n  Let me lean toward ""BULKS"": because it uses L and K which are common? Or H might be more common than K? Actually, according to typical frequency, H is more common than K.\n\n  But we want to maximize information? Actually, both are unplayed.\n\n  Another option: ""SHYLY"" -> S at the start? But it has Y repeated? But valid word? Meaning in a shy manner? It\'s an adverb? Might be acceptable.\n\n  To be safe, I\'ll go with ""BUSHY"": because it\'s a common word.\n\n  But wait, S is at position 3? And we haven\'t tried S at 3? And position 4 is H? Which we haven\'t tested? And we know position 4 in the secret is not S? So H is a new letter? So we test H.\n\n  Alternatively, ""BLUES"" -> but E is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  Final decision: ""BUSHY"".\n\n  Alternatively, a word without S? Doesn\'t make sense? We must include S? Because we know it\'s in the word? So we have to include S.\n\n  So guess: ""bushy"".\n\n  But note: in ""BUSHY"", the S is at position 3? We might hit if the S is at 3? But we don\'t know.\n\n  Or we might get feedback that S is at a different position? Either way.\n\n  So:\n\n   Guess: BUSHY\n\n   If the feedback tells us about B, U, S, H, Y.\n\n   Especially, if S is in the word and at position 3? Then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if S is elsewhere? Then we get a - for S? But we know S is in the word? So we might get either ✓ or - at position 3? And if we get ✓, we lock position 3 is S? That would be great? But it might not be.\n\n  Alternatively, if we put S at a new position, we can get information? We did position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 are untested? So we want to test one of them? ""BUSHY"" tests position 3? Good.\n\n  Therefore, let\'s choose ""BUSHY"".\n\n  However, note: the secret word might have S at position 1 or 2 or 5? We haven\'t tested them? So we might get feedback that S is present but not at position 3? Then we know it must be at 1,2, or 5? And then we have to guess again? That\'s okay? We have 4 more guesses? So it\'s acceptable.\n\n  Alternatively, we might spread letters? But we are using 4 new letters and one we know? That\'s efficient.\n\n  We\'ll go with ""BUSHY"".<thinking>\nBased on the feedback:\n\n- First guess ""crane"": All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word contains none of these letters.\n- Second guess ""moist"": \n  - M, O, I, T are absent → excluded.\n  - S is present but in the wrong position (since marked as ""-"") → this confirms S is in the word, but not in the 4th position (as guessed in ""moist"").\n\nNow, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word must contain S (somewhere except position 4) and use letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the new guess:\n1. Must include S but avoid position 4 to test its new potential locations (1, 2, 3, or 5).\n2. Should prioritize testing common unused consonants (B, H, L) and vowels (U) from the remaining letters.\n3. Avoid repeating excluded letters and reuse S strategically.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""BUSHY"" (B, U, S, H, Y) fits best:\n  - Includes S at position 3 (untested position).\n  - Tests new common letters: B, U, H, Y.\n  - B and H are high-frequency consonants; U is a common vowel.\n  - Valid English word (meaning overgrown with bushes).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows possibilities for S while gathering new letter data.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>bushy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: bushy -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. ""moist"": M, O, I, T are absent (x), and S is present but not in the correct position (S(-)). So the secret word contains S, but not at position 4 (since in ""moist"", S was at position 4).
3. ""bushy"": 
   - B is absent (x)
   - U is correct and in the correct position (U(✓) at position 2)
   - S is present but not in the correct position (S(-) at position 3) -> so S is in the word, but not at position 3 (and we already know not at position 4 from the previous guess)
   - H is absent (x)
   - Y is correct and in the correct position (Y(✓) at position 5)

So from ""bushy"", we know:
- Position 2 is U (fixed)
- Position 5 is Y (fixed)
- The word contains S, but not at position 3 or 4 (and not at 2 or 5 because they are fixed as U and Y). Therefore, S must be at position 1? Because that's the only position left? The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
  - Position 2: U
  - Position 5: Y
  - Position 3: not S (from ""bushy"" feedback)
  - Position 4: not S (from ""moist"" feedback)
  - Therefore, S must be at position 1.

But wait, we have only 5 positions. So if S is not at 2,3,4,5, then it must be at 1. So we can deduce that the secret word has S at position 1.

Additionally, we have the following information:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B, H (from the x's in all guesses). 
  - From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E
  - From ""moist"": M, O, I, T
  - From ""bushy"": B, H
  - So total excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B, H.

- The secret word has: 
  - Position 1: S (as deduced)
  - Position 2: U
  - Position 5: Y
  - And we know the word contains S (which we now know is at position 1) and we have two more letters to find: at position 3 and 4.

- The letters at positions 3 and 4 must be from the remaining available letters, excluding the ones we know and the excluded ones.

Available letters: We have used S, U, Y (and they are fixed). Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B,H.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, X, Z. (and possibly others? Let's list the alphabet: A to Z, remove the excluded: 
Excluded: A,B,C,E,H,I,M,N,O,R,T -> so remaining: D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But note: S, U, Y are already in the word, so for positions 3 and 4, we need to choose from the remaining available that are not excluded and not already placed? But we can use letters that are not in the word? Actually, we don't know if they are in the word? We are to find two new letters.

But note: we have already placed S, U, Y. So the secret word is: S _ _ _ Y, with the second letter U? Actually, position 2 is U and position 5 is Y, and position 1 is S. So the word is: S U _ _ Y.

Now, the two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) must be two letters from the remaining available set, and they must form a valid English word.

The available letters (not excluded and not already in the word? But we don't know if the word has duplicates? But we have no information about duplicates so far? So we assume no duplicates? Or we can have duplicates? But we haven't seen any yet? However, we must consider the possibility? But to be safe, we can avoid duplicates? But the feedback doesn't show any duplicates? So let's assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we have to consider that the word might have duplicates? But we haven't encountered any? So we can try without duplicates first.

Available letters for positions 3 and 4: from the set of letters not excluded and not already in the word? The word already has S, U, Y. So we avoid using these again? But if the word has duplicates, we can? But we don't know? So we can try without duplicates.

So available letters: D, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, X, Z. (and also J, Q? But we didn't list them? Let me list all letters and remove the excluded and the used ones.

Alphabet: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Excluded: A,B,C,E,H,I,M,N,O,R,T

So available: D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But wait, we have already placed S, U, Y in the word? So if we assume no duplicates, then we cannot use S, U, Y again? So for positions 3 and 4, we must choose from: D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But note: we are not forced to avoid duplicates? The word might have duplicates? But we have no evidence? So we can try without duplicates? But we have to form a valid word.

The word must be of the form: S U ? ? Y

We need to find two letters (say L1 and L2) such that ""SU"" + L1 + L2 + ""Y"" is a valid English word.

Possible words: 
  - SULLY: S U L L Y -> but L repeated? And L is available? But we have two L's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Also, we haven't tested L? But in ""SULLY"", we have L at position 3 and 4? But we are to find two distinct letters? Or not necessarily? Actually, they can be the same? But we don't know.

But let's check: ""SULLY"" is a word? Yes. But we have two L's? So we would be using L twice? And we haven't tested L? So we don't know if L is in the word? But we are about to test? But we are making a guess? So we can try? But we have to see if it fits.

But note: we have not excluded L? So it's possible.

But we have other options? 

We can list possible words: 
  - SULKY: S U L K Y -> but K is available? And we haven't used K? So that's a possibility? And no duplicates? So ""SULKY"" is a valid word.

  - SULPHY? Not a word? Or SULPHY is not common? 

  - SUDDY? Not a word.

  - SUGGY? Not a word.

  - SULFY? Not a word.

  - SULPH? Not 5 letters? SULPH is 5? S,U,L,P,H -> but H is excluded? So invalid.

  - SULKY: S U L K Y -> valid.

  - SUNNY: but N is excluded? And we have two N's? But N is excluded -> invalid.

  - SURFY: but R is excluded -> invalid.

  - SUPPLY? 6 letters? No.

  - SUPPY? Not a word.

  - SULFA: but A is excluded -> invalid.

  - SULKS: but S is repeated? And we have S at position 1? So if we put S at position 4? But we know position 4 is not S? Because from ""moist"" we know S is not at position 4? And from ""bushy"" we know S is not at position 3? And we now have S at position 1? So if we put S at position 4 again? That would be invalid? Because we know position 4 is not S? So ""SULKS"" would have S at position 1 and 4? But position 4 cannot be S? So that's not possible? So we avoid.

  - SULKY: seems a good candidate? But we have to check if K is available? Yes, not excluded.

  - Other words: SUDOR? Not 5? S U D O R -> O and R excluded? Invalid.

  - SUDDS? Not a word? And D repeated? And we don't know D? But ""sudds"" is not a word? The word is ""sudd"" (but that's 4 letters).

  - SUKHS? S U K H S -> H excluded? and S repeated? and position 4 is H? But H is excluded? So invalid.

  - SULCI? but I excluded? invalid.

  - SULUS? S U L U S -> U repeated? and S repeated? and we have U at position 2? So if we put U at position 3? But we don't know? But the word would be ""SULUS""? Not a common word? And we have U at position 2 and 3? But we already have U at position 2? So if the secret word has two U's? But we don't know? But ""SULUS"" is not a valid English word? I think not.

  - So ""SULKY"" is a strong candidate.

But wait, we have Y at the end? And in ""SULKY"", we have Y at the end? So that matches? And we have U at position 2? And S at position 1? So the word would be S U L K Y.

Now, we need to check if L and K are available? They are not excluded? And we haven't used them? So we can test them.

But note: we have not tested L and K? So we are using two new letters? That's good? We are testing them.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common letters? But we don't have many options? Because the available letters are limited.

Another word: ""SUGAR""? But A and R excluded? invalid.

""SULFA"": A excluded? invalid.

""SUMAC"": A and C excluded? invalid.

""SUMPH"": H excluded? invalid.

""SUMPT"": U and T? T excluded? invalid.

So ""SULKY"" seems a valid option.

But we have to consider: we have two positions to fill? And we are guessing the entire word? So we can guess ""SULKY"".

But note: we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess? We have used 3? So we have 3 more? But we are allowed 6? So we can try.

But if we are confident? We have deduced that position 1 must be S? Because S must be at 1? Let me reconfirm:

- We know S is in the word? And the positions are 1,2,3,4,5.
- We know position 2 is U (from ""bushy"" U✓ at position 2).
- We know position 5 is Y (from ""bushy"" Y✓ at position 5).
- We know S is not at position 3 (from ""bushy"" S- at position 3) and not at position 4 (from ""moist"" S- at position 4).
- Therefore, the only position left for S is position 1? Yes.

So the word must start with S, then U, then two letters, then Y.

So the word is S U ? ? Y.

Now, we need to fill the two middle letters? And we have a candidate: ""SULKY"" (S U L K Y).

But is ""SULKY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning sullen or morose? And it's 5 letters.

We can also consider ""SUDSY""? But D and S? S repeated? And we have S at position 1? So if we put S at position 4? But we know position 4 is not S? So ""SUDSY"" would be S U D S Y -> but position 4 is S? Which we know is not? So invalid? So we cannot use that.

Another: ""SUCKY""? But C is excluded? invalid.

""SULKY"" is the best candidate? Or ""SULLY""? But ""SULLY"" has two L's? So S U L L Y? That would be a valid word? Meaning to soil or defile? And we haven't tested L? So we can try? But we have two possibilities? We don't know which one? But we can only guess one? So we have to choose one? 

But note: we have two guesses? We can try one? But we are on the fourth guess? We have two more after? So we can try ""SULKY"" and if it's wrong, we try ""SULLY""? But that might be inefficient? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the two positions without committing to a specific word? But we have to guess a valid word? And we have to include the fixed letters? So we cannot avoid? Because we have to have S at 1, U at 2, Y at 5? So the word must be of the form S U ? ? Y.

So we have to choose the two middle letters? And we have limited options? 

Possible words with the available letters (without duplicates? and without excluded letters? and without using S,U,Y again? if we assume no duplicates?):

- S U L K Y -> SULKY
- S U L L Y -> SULLY (but duplicate L? so if we allow duplicates? but we don't know? but it's a valid word? and we haven't tested L? so we can try? but we have to choose one? 
- S U P P Y? Not a word? 
- S U W W Y? Not a word?
- S U G G Y? Not a word? 
- S U D D Y? Not a word? 
- S U F F Y? F is available? and ""SUFFY"" is not a word? 
- S U L P H? H excluded? invalid? 
- S U B B Y? B excluded? invalid? 
- S U M M Y? M excluded? invalid? 
- S U R R Y? R excluded? invalid? 
- S U V V Y? Not a word? 
- S U Z Z Y? Z is available? and ""SUZZY"" is not a word? 
- S U K K Y? Not a word? 
- S U L F Y? F is available? but ""SULFY"" is not a word? 
- S U L P Y? P is available? ""SULPY"" is not a word? 
- S U L K Y and S U L L Y are the only common ones? 

So we have two candidates: SULKY and SULLY.

How to decide? We can try one? 

But note: we have feedback that might help? We don't have any information about L or K? So we have to guess? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use L? But then what? For example, ""SUQ"" words? Not many? 

We can try ""SULKY"" because it uses two distinct new letters? So we get more information? But if it's wrong, we can try SULLY? 

But we have two guesses left? We are about to make the fourth guess? Then we have two more? So we can try SULKY? 

But if we are lucky, it might be correct? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses two different letters? Like S U D G Y? But ""sudgy"" is not a word? 

Or S U P P Y? Not a word? 

So we have to choose between SULKY and SULLY? 

But note: in SULLY, we are using L twice? So if the word has L, then we might get feedback? But we don't know? 

But we can also consider: we have not tested the letter L? So if we guess SULKY, and if the word is SULLY, then we would get:
  - S: ✓ (position 1)
  - U: ✓ (position 2)
  - L: but in SULKY we have L at position 3? and in SULLY, L is at position 3 and 4? So for the guess SULKY:
      Position 3: L -> in SULLY, position 3 is L? so that would be ✓? 
      Position 4: K -> in SULLY, position 4 is L? so K is not in the word? so K(x)
      Position 5: Y: ✓
  So feedback: S(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓) -> so we would know that the word is S U L ? Y? and the fourth letter is not K? and we know it must be L? because we have only two options? So we can then guess SULLY? 

Similarly, if we guess SULLY and the word is SULKY, then:
  - S(✓), U(✓), L at position 3: in SULKY, position 3 is L? so if the word is SULKY, then position 3 is L? so L(✓) for position 3? 
  - Then position 4: L? in SULKY, position 4 is K? so L is not at position 4? but we have two L's? So the feedback might mark the first L as ✓ and the second L as x? Because the word has only one L? Or if the word has one L? But SULKY has one L? So in SULLY, we have two L's? So for the guess SULLY against SULKY:
      Position 1: S(✓)
      Position 2: U(✓)
      Position 3: L(✓) because SULKY has L at position 3? 
      Position 4: L -> but SULKY does not have a second L? so L is absent? so L(x)
      Position 5: Y(✓)
  So feedback: S(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(x) Y(✓) -> so we know the word has only one L? and it is at position 3? and position 4 is not L? and we know it must be K? because we have only two options? So we can then guess SULKY? 

So in either case, we can get the word in the next guess? 

But we are making the fourth guess? So we have two more? So we can choose either? 

But to be efficient? We can choose one arbitrarily? 

Let me choose ""SULKY"" as the fourth guess? 

So guess: SULKY

If it's correct, we win? If not, we get feedback and then we can guess SULLY? 

But note: there might be other words? For example, ""SUDGY"" is not a word? Or ""SUGNY""? Not a word? 

Another possibility: ""SUCKY"" but C excluded? invalid? 

Or ""SUMPY""? Not a word? 

So I think SULKY and SULLY are the only two common words? 

Therefore, we guess ""SULKY"". 

But wait, we have the letter G? We haven't tested G? But we don't have a word ""SUG_Y""? 

Similarly, P? ""SUP_Y""? Not a word? 

So we are safe? 

So let's go with ""SULKY"". 

But note: we have to output the guess? 

So: <guess>sulky</guess>

But let me double-check the feedback we have? 

We are confident that the word is S U ? ? Y? and the only two options are SULKY and SULLY? 

Yes? 

So we try SULKY? 

But if the word is SULLY, we will know? 

So we make the guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → excluded.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**: M, O, I, T are absent → excluded. S is present but not in position 4 (S(-)).
- **Guess 3 (bushy)**: 
  - B and H are absent → excluded.
  - U is correct and in position 2 (U(✓)).
  - S is present but not in position 3 (S(-)).
  - Y is correct and in position 5 (Y(✓)).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 2 must be **U**.
   - Position 5 must be **Y**.
2. **S placement**: 
   - S is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). 
   - With positions 2 and 5 fixed, and S absent from positions 3 and 4, **S must be at position 1**.
3. **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B, H (all marked absent).
4. **Word structure**: The secret word is **S U _ _ Y**.
5. **Available letters for positions 3–4**: D, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, X, Z (not excluded and not used in fixed positions).

### Analysis:
- The only common English words fitting **S U _ _ Y** are **SULKY** (sullen) and **SULLY** (to tarnish). 
- **SULKY** tests two new letters (L and K) and avoids duplicates, maximizing information gain. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if L or K are present, narrowing to **SULLY**.
- Given the constraints, **SULKY** is the optimal guess to resolve the remaining uncertainty.

<guess>sulky</guess>",sulky,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. ""moist"": M, O, I, T are absent (x), and S is present but not in the correct position (S(-)). So the secret word contains S, but not at position 4 (since in ""moist"", S was at position 4).
3. ""bushy"": 
   - B is absent (x)
   - U is correct and in the correct position (U(✓) at position 2)
   - S is present but not in the correct position (S(-) at position 3) -> so S is in the word, but not at position 3 (and we already know not at position 4 from the previous guess)
   - H is absent (x)
   - Y is correct and in the correct position (Y(✓) at position 5)

So from ""bushy"", we know:
- Position 2 is U (fixed)
- Position 5 is Y (fixed)
- The word contains S, but not at position 3 or 4 (and not at 2 or 5 because they are fixed as U and Y). Therefore, S must be at position 1? Because that's the only position left? The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
  - Position 2: U
  - Position 5: Y
  - Position 3: not S (from ""bushy"" feedback)
  - Position 4: not S (from ""moist"" feedback)
  - Therefore, S must be at position 1.

But wait, we have only 5 positions. So if S is not at 2,3,4,5, then it must be at 1. So we can deduce that the secret word has S at position 1.

Additionally, we have the following information:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B, H (from the x's in all guesses). 
  - From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E
  - From ""moist"": M, O, I, T
  - From ""bushy"": B, H
  - So total excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B, H.

- The secret word has: 
  - Position 1: S (as deduced)
  - Position 2: U
  - Position 5: Y
  - And we know the word contains S (which we now know is at position 1) and we have two more letters to find: at position 3 and 4.

- The letters at positions 3 and 4 must be from the remaining available letters, excluding the ones we know and the excluded ones.

Available letters: We have used S, U, Y (and they are fixed). Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B,H.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, X, Z. (and possibly others? Let's list the alphabet: A to Z, remove the excluded: 
Excluded: A,B,C,E,H,I,M,N,O,R,T -> so remaining: D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But note: S, U, Y are already in the word, so for positions 3 and 4, we need to choose from the remaining available that are not excluded and not already placed? But we can use letters that are not in the word? Actually, we don't know if they are in the word? We are to find two new letters.

But note: we have already placed S, U, Y. So the secret word is: S _ _ _ Y, with the second letter U? Actually, position 2 is U and position 5 is Y, and position 1 is S. So the word is: S U _ _ Y.

Now, the two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) must be two letters from the remaining available set, and they must form a valid English word.

The available letters (not excluded and not already in the word? But we don't know if the word has duplicates? But we have no information about duplicates so far? So we assume no duplicates? Or we can have duplicates? But we haven't seen any yet? However, we must consider the possibility? But to be safe, we can avoid duplicates? But the feedback doesn't show any duplicates? So let's assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we have to consider that the word might have duplicates? But we haven't encountered any? So we can try without duplicates first.

Available letters for positions 3 and 4: from the set of letters not excluded and not already in the word? The word already has S, U, Y. So we avoid using these again? But if the word has duplicates, we can? But we don't know? So we can try without duplicates.

So available letters: D, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, X, Z. (and also J, Q? But we didn't list them? Let me list all letters and remove the excluded and the used ones.

Alphabet: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Excluded: A,B,C,E,H,I,M,N,O,R,T

So available: D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But wait, we have already placed S, U, Y in the word? So if we assume no duplicates, then we cannot use S, U, Y again? So for positions 3 and 4, we must choose from: D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But note: we are not forced to avoid duplicates? The word might have duplicates? But we have no evidence? So we can try without duplicates? But we have to form a valid word.

The word must be of the form: S U ? ? Y

We need to find two letters (say L1 and L2) such that ""SU"" + L1 + L2 + ""Y"" is a valid English word.

Possible words: 
  - SULLY: S U L L Y -> but L repeated? And L is available? But we have two L's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Also, we haven't tested L? But in ""SULLY"", we have L at position 3 and 4? But we are to find two distinct letters? Or not necessarily? Actually, they can be the same? But we don't know.

But let's check: ""SULLY"" is a word? Yes. But we have two L's? So we would be using L twice? And we haven't tested L? So we don't know if L is in the word? But we are about to test? But we are making a guess? So we can try? But we have to see if it fits.

But note: we have not excluded L? So it's possible.

But we have other options? 

We can list possible words: 
  - SULKY: S U L K Y -> but K is available? And we haven't used K? So that's a possibility? And no duplicates? So ""SULKY"" is a valid word.

  - SULPHY? Not a word? Or SULPHY is not common? 

  - SUDDY? Not a word.

  - SUGGY? Not a word.

  - SULFY? Not a word.

  - SULPH? Not 5 letters? SULPH is 5? S,U,L,P,H -> but H is excluded? So invalid.

  - SULKY: S U L K Y -> valid.

  - SUNNY: but N is excluded? And we have two N's? But N is excluded -> invalid.

  - SURFY: but R is excluded -> invalid.

  - SUPPLY? 6 letters? No.

  - SUPPY? Not a word.

  - SULFA: but A is excluded -> invalid.

  - SULKS: but S is repeated? And we have S at position 1? So if we put S at position 4? But we know position 4 is not S? Because from ""moist"" we know S is not at position 4? And from ""bushy"" we know S is not at position 3? And we now have S at position 1? So if we put S at position 4 again? That would be invalid? Because we know position 4 is not S? So ""SULKS"" would have S at position 1 and 4? But position 4 cannot be S? So that's not possible? So we avoid.

  - SULKY: seems a good candidate? But we have to check if K is available? Yes, not excluded.

  - Other words: SUDOR? Not 5? S U D O R -> O and R excluded? Invalid.

  - SUDDS? Not a word? And D repeated? And we don't know D? But ""sudds"" is not a word? The word is ""sudd"" (but that's 4 letters).

  - SUKHS? S U K H S -> H excluded? and S repeated? and position 4 is H? But H is excluded? So invalid.

  - SULCI? but I excluded? invalid.

  - SULUS? S U L U S -> U repeated? and S repeated? and we have U at position 2? So if we put U at position 3? But we don't know? But the word would be ""SULUS""? Not a common word? And we have U at position 2 and 3? But we already have U at position 2? So if the secret word has two U's? But we don't know? But ""SULUS"" is not a valid English word? I think not.

  - So ""SULKY"" is a strong candidate.

But wait, we have Y at the end? And in ""SULKY"", we have Y at the end? So that matches? And we have U at position 2? And S at position 1? So the word would be S U L K Y.

Now, we need to check if L and K are available? They are not excluded? And we haven't used them? So we can test them.

But note: we have not tested L and K? So we are using two new letters? That's good? We are testing them.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common letters? But we don't have many options? Because the available letters are limited.

Another word: ""SUGAR""? But A and R excluded? invalid.

""SULFA"": A excluded? invalid.

""SUMAC"": A and C excluded? invalid.

""SUMPH"": H excluded? invalid.

""SUMPT"": U and T? T excluded? invalid.

So ""SULKY"" seems a valid option.

But we have to consider: we have two positions to fill? And we are guessing the entire word? So we can guess ""SULKY"".

But note: we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess? We have used 3? So we have 3 more? But we are allowed 6? So we can try.

But if we are confident? We have deduced that position 1 must be S? Because S must be at 1? Let me reconfirm:

- We know S is in the word? And the positions are 1,2,3,4,5.
- We know position 2 is U (from ""bushy"" U✓ at position 2).
- We know position 5 is Y (from ""bushy"" Y✓ at position 5).
- We know S is not at position 3 (from ""bushy"" S- at position 3) and not at position 4 (from ""moist"" S- at position 4).
- Therefore, the only position left for S is position 1? Yes.

So the word must start with S, then U, then two letters, then Y.

So the word is S U ? ? Y.

Now, we need to fill the two middle letters? And we have a candidate: ""SULKY"" (S U L K Y).

But is ""SULKY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning sullen or morose? And it's 5 letters.

We can also consider ""SUDSY""? But D and S? S repeated? And we have S at position 1? So if we put S at position 4? But we know position 4 is not S? So ""SUDSY"" would be S U D S Y -> but position 4 is S? Which we know is not? So invalid? So we cannot use that.

Another: ""SUCKY""? But C is excluded? invalid.

""SULKY"" is the best candidate? Or ""SULLY""? But ""SULLY"" has two L's? So S U L L Y? That would be a valid word? Meaning to soil or defile? And we haven't tested L? So we can try? But we have two possibilities? We don't know which one? But we can only guess one? So we have to choose one? 

But note: we have two guesses? We can try one? But we are on the fourth guess? We have two more after? So we can try ""SULKY"" and if it's wrong, we try ""SULLY""? But that might be inefficient? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the two positions without committing to a specific word? But we have to guess a valid word? And we have to include the fixed letters? So we cannot avoid? Because we have to have S at 1, U at 2, Y at 5? So the word must be of the form S U ? ? Y.

So we have to choose the two middle letters? And we have limited options? 

Possible words with the available letters (without duplicates? and without excluded letters? and without using S,U,Y again? if we assume no duplicates?):

- S U L K Y -> SULKY
- S U L L Y -> SULLY (but duplicate L? so if we allow duplicates? but we don't know? but it's a valid word? and we haven't tested L? so we can try? but we have to choose one? 
- S U P P Y? Not a word? 
- S U W W Y? Not a word?
- S U G G Y? Not a word? 
- S U D D Y? Not a word? 
- S U F F Y? F is available? and ""SUFFY"" is not a word? 
- S U L P H? H excluded? invalid? 
- S U B B Y? B excluded? invalid? 
- S U M M Y? M excluded? invalid? 
- S U R R Y? R excluded? invalid? 
- S U V V Y? Not a word? 
- S U Z Z Y? Z is available? and ""SUZZY"" is not a word? 
- S U K K Y? Not a word? 
- S U L F Y? F is available? but ""SULFY"" is not a word? 
- S U L P Y? P is available? ""SULPY"" is not a word? 
- S U L K Y and S U L L Y are the only common ones? 

So we have two candidates: SULKY and SULLY.

How to decide? We can try one? 

But note: we have feedback that might help? We don't have any information about L or K? So we have to guess? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use L? But then what? For example, ""SUQ"" words? Not many? 

We can try ""SULKY"" because it uses two distinct new letters? So we get more information? But if it's wrong, we can try SULLY? 

But we have two guesses left? We are about to make the fourth guess? Then we have two more? So we can try SULKY? 

But if we are lucky, it might be correct? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses two different letters? Like S U D G Y? But ""sudgy"" is not a word? 

Or S U P P Y? Not a word? 

So we have to choose between SULKY and SULLY? 

But note: in SULLY, we are using L twice? So if the word has L, then we might get feedback? But we don't know? 

But we can also consider: we have not tested the letter L? So if we guess SULKY, and if the word is SULLY, then we would get:
  - S: ✓ (position 1)
  - U: ✓ (position 2)
  - L: but in SULKY we have L at position 3? and in SULLY, L is at position 3 and 4? So for the guess SULKY:
      Position 3: L -> in SULLY, position 3 is L? so that would be ✓? 
      Position 4: K -> in SULLY, position 4 is L? so K is not in the word? so K(x)
      Position 5: Y: ✓
  So feedback: S(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓) -> so we would know that the word is S U L ? Y? and the fourth letter is not K? and we know it must be L? because we have only two options? So we can then guess SULLY? 

Similarly, if we guess SULLY and the word is SULKY, then:
  - S(✓), U(✓), L at position 3: in SULKY, position 3 is L? so if the word is SULKY, then position 3 is L? so L(✓) for position 3? 
  - Then position 4: L? in SULKY, position 4 is K? so L is not at position 4? but we have two L's? So the feedback might mark the first L as ✓ and the second L as x? Because the word has only one L? Or if the word has one L? But SULKY has one L? So in SULLY, we have two L's? So for the guess SULLY against SULKY:
      Position 1: S(✓)
      Position 2: U(✓)
      Position 3: L(✓) because SULKY has L at position 3? 
      Position 4: L -> but SULKY does not have a second L? so L is absent? so L(x)
      Position 5: Y(✓)
  So feedback: S(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(x) Y(✓) -> so we know the word has only one L? and it is at position 3? and position 4 is not L? and we know it must be K? because we have only two options? So we can then guess SULKY? 

So in either case, we can get the word in the next guess? 

But we are making the fourth guess? So we have two more? So we can choose either? 

But to be efficient? We can choose one arbitrarily? 

Let me choose ""SULKY"" as the fourth guess? 

So guess: SULKY

If it's correct, we win? If not, we get feedback and then we can guess SULLY? 

But note: there might be other words? For example, ""SUDGY"" is not a word? Or ""SUGNY""? Not a word? 

Another possibility: ""SUCKY"" but C excluded? invalid? 

Or ""SUMPY""? Not a word? 

So I think SULKY and SULLY are the only two common words? 

Therefore, we guess ""SULKY"". 

But wait, we have the letter G? We haven't tested G? But we don't have a word ""SUG_Y""? 

Similarly, P? ""SUP_Y""? Not a word? 

So we are safe? 

So let's go with ""SULKY"". 

But note: we have to output the guess? 

So: <guess>sulky</guess>

But let me double-check the feedback we have? 

We are confident that the word is S U ? ? Y? and the only two options are SULKY and SULLY? 

Yes? 

So we try SULKY? 

But if the word is SULLY, we will know? 

So we make the guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → excluded.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**: M, O, I, T are absent → excluded. S is present but not in position 4 (S(-)).
- **Guess 3 (bushy)**: 
  - B and H are absent → excluded.
  - U is correct and in position 2 (U(✓)).
  - S is present but not in position 3 (S(-)).
  - Y is correct and in position 5 (Y(✓)).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 2 must be **U**.
   - Position 5 must be **Y**.
2. **S placement**: 
   - S is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). 
   - With positions 2 and 5 fixed, and S absent from positions 3 and 4, **S must be at position 1**.
3. **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B, H (all marked absent).
4. **Word structure**: The secret word is **S U _ _ Y**.
5. **Available letters for positions 3–4**: D, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, X, Z (not excluded and not used in fixed positions).

### Analysis:
- The only common English words fitting **S U _ _ Y** are **SULKY** (sullen) and **SULLY** (to tarnish). 
- **SULKY** tests two new letters (L and K) and avoids duplicates, maximizing information gain. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if L or K are present, narrowing to **SULLY**.
- Given the constraints, **SULKY** is the optimal guess to resolve the remaining uncertainty.",Guess 4: sulky -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,sully,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no information yet, so we should choose a word that can give us a lot of information.
 A good starting word often has common letters and avoids repeating letters to maximize information gain.
 Common starting words in Wordle are like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let me pick one.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word with common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. A balanced word like ""CRANE"" is effective because:
- It includes three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, covering more possibilities.
- The letters (C, R, A, N, E) frequently appear in English words, helping identify correct letters/positions quickly.
This sets a strong foundation for subsequent guesses based on feedback.
</thinking>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback that for the first guess ""crane"", all letters are incorrect (x). 
 This means that the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Therefore, we must choose a new 5-letter word that does not include any of these letters.

 We need to pick a word that uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C, R, A, N, E) might include: 
   S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, etc.

 A good starting point might be a word like ""SLOTH"" or ""PILOT"", but let's think of one that avoids the excluded letters.

 Since we have excluded 5 letters, we have a lot of the alphabet left.

 Let's consider: 
   S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, W, F, K, V, etc.

 We can try a word that has common letters we haven't tried yet.

 Example: ""SLIMY"" -> but let's check: S, L, I, M, Y. None of these are in the excluded set (C,R,A,N,E). 

 Alternatively, ""POINT"" -> P, O, I, N, T -> but N is excluded (we got x for N in the first guess). So we cannot use N.

 We must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Another idea: ""LIGHT"" -> L, I, G, H, T. All these are not excluded.

 But we might want to cover more common letters. Let's try ""TOILS"" or ""STOMP"".

 However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let me list some common letters we haven't used: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, V, W, X, Z (but X and Z are less common).

 We can try a word that uses 5 of the most common remaining letters.

 According to letter frequency in English, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common are: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H.

 We can try: ""SIGHT"" -> S, I, G, H, T. This covers S, I, G, H, T.

 Another option: ""MOIST"" -> M, O, I, S, T. This covers M, O, I, S, T.

 ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has common letters and we haven't tried any of them.

 Alternatively, ""PLUMB"" but that has B which is less common and we might not get as much information.

 Let's go with ""MOIST"".

 So the next guess: ""moist""<thinking>
The feedback for ""crane"" showed that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, the secret word must consist entirely of letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding C, R, A, N, E). 

To maximize information gain, I should choose a new word that:
1. Uses 5 entirely new, high-frequency English letters not yet tested.
2. Avoids repeating the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).
3. Prioritizes common consonants and vowels from the remaining set.

The most frequent remaining letters in English 5-letter words are: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, V, W. 

A strong candidate is **""MOIST""** because:
- It uses 5 common letters: M, O, I, S, T.
- All letters are distinct, increasing coverage.
- It includes the vowel O and I, plus high-frequency consonants (S, T, M).
- No overlap with excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).

This guess will efficiently narrow down possibilities based on the feedback for M, O, I, S, and T.
</thinking>

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given:
- First guess ""crane"": all letters are absent (x), so the word has no C, R, A, N, E.
- Second guess ""moist"": M(x), O(x), I(x), S(-), T(x). So:
  - S is in the word but in the wrong position (since it's marked as -).
  - M, O, I, T are NOT in the word.

 Important: Since we have S marked as ""-"", it means the secret word contains S, but not in the 4th position (because in ""moist"", S is the 4th letter).

 Also, we have now excluded the following letters: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess) and M, O, I, T (from second guess) -> total excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.

 So the word must contain S and must not contain any of the excluded letters. Also, we know S is not in the 4th position.

 We need to make a new guess that:
 1. Includes S (since we know it's in the word) but not in the 4th position.
 2. Avoids any of the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T.
 3. Uses new letters to gain more information.

 What letters are available? We've excluded 9 letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T.
 The remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: S is confirmed and must be included, so our guess must have S in one of the positions 1,2,3,5 (not 4).

 Now, we need to choose a word with S and 4 other letters from the remaining set.

 Considering common English words, we might consider using common letters from the remaining set.

 The most common remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, Y.

 Let's try to form a word with S and some of these.

 Possible words:
 - We can try words with S at the start or end.

 Examples:
  - ""SLEEP"" but E is excluded -> invalid.
  - ""SKULL"": S at start, K, U, L, L. However, we have excluded letters? K, U, L are not excluded, but we have two L's -> but the word may have repeated letters? We don't know, but it's allowed.

 But note: we have not encountered repeated letters in feedback so far, but the secret word might have repeats.

 How about ""SLUMP""? But M is excluded -> invalid.

 Let's list possible words:

  We have to use S and avoid excluded letters.

 Some ideas:

 - ""SALAD"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.
 - ""SHYLY"" -> S, H, Y, L, Y -> Y twice, and H, Y, L are available. But is SHYLY allowed? It's a valid word.

 However, we want to cover multiple common letters. Let's try:

 - ""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> two K's. Valid?
 - ""SPLIT"": but P is available, L, I (excluded) -> I is excluded, invalid.

 Since I is excluded, we can't use I.

 Another: ""SHOWY"" -> S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is excluded -> invalid.

 We are avoiding O because it's excluded.

 After excluding M,O,I,T, and first set, we must use letters from: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

 Let's try to form words:

 - ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all allowed? Yes. And S is at position 1. But note: we need to avoid the 4th position for S? Our S can be anywhere except position 4. So position 1 is fine.

 However, ""SULKY"" has U, L, K, Y. Also, we don't know if U, L, K, Y are in the word.

 Alternatively, we could use ""SWUNG"": S, W, U, N, G -> but N is excluded -> invalid.

 How about ""SHULK""? Not a common word.

 ""SIGHT"": but I and G? I is excluded -> invalid.

 Another: ""SKULK"" might be acceptable? Or ""SKYED""? But less common.

 Let's consider: ""LYSSA"" -> but not 5 letters? Actually, L-Y-S-S-A -> but A is excluded.

 Alternatively, ""PALSY"": P, A, L, S, Y -> A is excluded -> invalid.

 How about ""SLUSH"": S, L, U, S, H -> but S repeated? And H. So: S at positions 1 and 4? But we cannot have S at position 4 because the feedback for ""moist"" marked S as present but not in the 4th position. However, if the word has two S's, then the feedback for ""moist"" only tells us that one S is not at position 4. So having S at position 4 might be allowed if there is another S? Actually, no: because the feedback for ""moist"" only shows one S (since we had one S) -> so if there were two S's in the secret word, we would have gotten two ""-"" or one ""✓"" and one ""-"", etc. But we got only one S marked as ""-"", so that means at least one S is in the word and it's not in position 4. If the secret word has two S's, then one S is not at position 4, but the other could be anywhere. However, we know that in ""moist"", only one S is present in the word? Because only one was marked. Actually, a ""-"" means that letter is in the word but not in that position, but it doesn't tell you if there are duplicates. But note: the standard Wordle behavior is that if you have duplicate letters, only the necessary number of markers are shown. However, in our rules, we haven't specified that. Since we are building this, let me clarify from the rules: The feedback symbol applies to each letter independently? But note the example: Secret word: BRISK, guess: STORM -> feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x). There is only one S in BRISK? Actually BRISK doesn't have S? Wait, the example: STORM for BRISK: S is in the word? BRISK does not have S? So let me check: secret word BRISK vs guess STORM. The S is not in BRISK? Then why is S marked as ""-""? That's a mistake? Actually, in the example: 
   Secret Word: BRISK
   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
But BRISK doesn't have S? That would be an error.

 Wait, I see: The example says:
   Secret Word: BRISK
   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

 But BRISK has the letters B, R, I, S, K. So:
   S: is in the word but not in the first position? In STORM, S is first, and in BRISK, S is fourth -> so it's present but not at position 1 -> so S(-) is correct.
   T: is not in BRISK -> T(x)
   O: not in BRISK -> O(x)
   R: in BRISK at position 2, but in STORM at position 4 -> so R(-)
   M: not in BRISK -> M(x)

 So the feedback is correct.

 Back to our case: In ""moist"", the word has one S. We got one ""-"" for S. This means the secret word has at least one S, and it is not in the 4th position. But if the secret word has two S's, then one S might be at a position we haven't guessed? That's possible. So we cannot completely rule out S at position 4? Actually, we can. Because in our guess ""moist"", we have only one S. If the secret word had two S's, then we would have gotten feedback for both? But note: the feedback might prioritize one occurrence.

 Standard Wordle feedback: 
   For duplicate letters: 
     If the guess has two of the same letter, and the word has one, then one is marked as ""-"" or ""✓"" and the other as ""x"". 
     If the word has two, and the guess has two, but only one is in the right position, then one might be ✓ and the other -. 
   But in our case, we only have one S in the guess. So we got one S marked with ""-"", meaning:
        There is at least one S in the secret word, and it is not in the fourth position.

   It does not preclude the secret word having a second S. But if it has a second S, then it could be at position 4? 
   However, if the secret word had an S at the fourth position, then in the guess ""moist"" at the fourth position (which is S) would have been marked ✓, because it would be correct. But we didn't get ✓, we got -. So that S is in the word but not at position 4. Thus, the secret word cannot have an S at position 4? Actually, yes: because if it did, then the S at position 4 in the guess would be correct and we would have gotten a ✓. So the position 4 in the secret word is not S.

   Therefore, we know for sure that the secret word has S but not at position 4, and position 4 is not S.

   Also, we don't know about other positions. But since we only have one S in the guess, if the word has two S's, that's okay, but we haven't tested the position of the second S? So we can't rule out S at other positions? Actually, the positions we haven't tested could be S? But note: we tested only position 4? In ""moist"", S was at 4. So any other position is untested.

   Therefore, in our next guess, we can put S at positions 1,2,3, or 5.

 Now, back to forming a word:

 We need a word that: 
   contains S (at least one) and places it not at position 4? Actually, we are allowed to put it anywhere except that we cannot put it at position 4? Actually, we know that position 4 is not S? Actually, we don't know about position 4 being not S? We only know that the S from our guess (which was at position 4) is not in the right place. But the secret word might have an S at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:

   The feedback told us that the S in our guess at position 4 is in the word (so the word has S) but it is not at position 4. This does not tell us anything about position 4 of the secret word? It could be any letter. It might even be another S? No, because if position 4 of the secret word was S, then our guess had S at position 4 and that would be a match (✓). We didn't get a match, so the secret word's position 4 is not S.

 Therefore, the secret word has an S, but position 4 of the secret word is not S. And our guess must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, we can put S at position 4 again, but that would be silly because we know it's not there? So we avoid that.

 And also, the secret word might have S in two positions? Then we might guess S at two positions? But currently we have no information on other positions.

 Since we want to test other letters, we might avoid putting two S's in our guess until we know more? Because we are limited by the number of letters we can test.

 Let's pick a word with one S (at first, last, or positions 2 or 3) and four other new letters.

 Given the constraints, I propose:

  ""SHULK"": but HULK? Valid? Or ""SHULK"" is not a word.

  ""SKYED"": not so common.

  ""SPLIT"": but I is excluded.

  How about ""SWAMP"": but A and M are excluded -> invalid.

  ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> that's a valid word (bulks). And S is at the end (position 5). Letters: B, U, L, K, S -> all allowed. Also, we haven't used these letters.

  Alternatively, ""FLUSH"": F, L, U, S, H -> valid? and S at position 4? But we cannot put S at position 4? Because we know position 4 of the secret is not S? So we must avoid S at position 4? Therefore, ""FLUSH"" has S at position 4 -> invalid guess? Actually, we can guess it? But we already know that position 4 is not S, so it would be wasteful? Actually, the guess must be valid 5-letter word, but it can have S at position 4? It's allowed, but we know that letter will be marked as either:
      x: if the word doesn't have a second S? 
      or -: if the word has a second S? 
   But we don't know if the word has two S's? It's risky? Maybe we can avoid it to use S in a new position.

  Better to put S in a position we haven't tested: positions 1,2,3, or 5.

  So ""BULKS"": S at position 5 -> good.

  Also, ""LUCKS"": L, U, C, K, S -> but C is excluded -> invalid.

  ""DUMPS"": D, U, M, P, S -> but M is excluded -> invalid.

  ""BUSKS"": B, U, S, K, S -> repeated S? But we are testing S again. Not ideal? But valid word? Also, we have S at positions 3 and 5.

  However, we want to test new letters. So ""BULKS"" tests B, U, L, K, and S at end.

  Another word: ""GUPSY""? Not common.

  ""SKULK"": valid? means to avoid work? We already thought of that. But it has S at position 1.

  But ""SKULK"" has two K's? And K is not excluded.

  Alternatively, ""HYPES"": H, Y, P, E, S -> E is excluded -> invalid.

  ""WISPY"": but W,I,S,P,Y -> I is excluded -> invalid.

  So ""BULKS"" seems okay? Or ""SKULK""?

  Let me check: ""SPLUG""? Not so common.

  ""SLUBS"": S, L, U, B, S -> repeated S? Valid, meaning links in a chain? But rare.

  Better to choose a more common word.

  How about ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> also repetitive? Meaning to be sulky? Valid? But we get to test U, L, K? And S at positions 1 and 5. But note: we are testing the same letter S twice? We already know S is in the word, so we might not gain much by testing two S's? We should avoid to save testing new letters.

  Therefore, without repeated S: ""BULKS"" or ""BLUSH"": BLUSH has S at position 5? Wait, B, L, U, S, H -> so S at position 4? But position 4 of the secret is not S? So we avoid S at position 4 -> ""BLUSH"" puts S at position 4 -> don't use.

  Instead, ""BUSHY"": B, U, S, H, Y -> S at position 3 -> okay. And letters B, U, S, H, Y -> all allowed.

  Is ""BUSH Y""? Actually, BUSHY is a valid word.

  So ""BUSHY"": positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y.

  Alternatively, ""PUSHY"": but P,U,S,H,Y -> similar.

  But note: we have not tried U, H, Y? They are new.

  Which word to pick? We have:

      Option 1: ""BULKS"" -> B, U, L, K, S (with S at 5)
      Option 2: ""BUSKY""? Not common.
      Option 3: ""BUSHY"" -> B, U, S, H, Y (S at 3)

  Both are valid. Let's choose the one that tests more common letters.

  Since B, U, L, K, S, H, Y are all available.

  Common letters: B, H, U, L, Y? H and L are common.

  ""BUSHY"" tests U, S, H, Y, and B? And S is at position 3. We haven't tested position 3 for S? So that's good.

  Similarly, ""BULKS"" tests U at position 2, L at 3, K at 4, S at 5? And we haven't tested positions 1,2,3,4 for letters? Actually, we did test position 4 in ""moist""? We know position 4 of the secret is not S? But we don't know what it is? So testing position 4 with a new letter K is good.

  Both seem acceptable.

  Let me lean toward ""BULKS"": because it uses L and K which are common? Or H might be more common than K? Actually, according to typical frequency, H is more common than K.

  But we want to maximize information? Actually, both are unplayed.

  Another option: ""SHYLY"" -> S at the start? But it has Y repeated? But valid word? Meaning in a shy manner? It's an adverb? Might be acceptable.

  To be safe, I'll go with ""BUSHY"": because it's a common word.

  But wait, S is at position 3? And we haven't tried S at 3? And position 4 is H? Which we haven't tested? And we know position 4 in the secret is not S? So H is a new letter? So we test H.

  Alternatively, ""BLUES"" -> but E is excluded -> invalid.

  Final decision: ""BUSHY"".

  Alternatively, a word without S? Doesn't make sense? We must include S? Because we know it's in the word? So we have to include S.

  So guess: ""bushy"".

  But note: in ""BUSHY"", the S is at position 3? We might hit if the S is at 3? But we don't know.

  Or we might get feedback that S is at a different position? Either way.

  So:

   Guess: BUSHY

   If the feedback tells us about B, U, S, H, Y.

   Especially, if S is in the word and at position 3? Then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if S is elsewhere? Then we get a - for S? But we know S is in the word? So we might get either ✓ or - at position 3? And if we get ✓, we lock position 3 is S? That would be great? But it might not be.

  Alternatively, if we put S at a new position, we can get information? We did position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 are untested? So we want to test one of them? ""BUSHY"" tests position 3? Good.

  Therefore, let's choose ""BUSHY"".

  However, note: the secret word might have S at position 1 or 2 or 5? We haven't tested them? So we might get feedback that S is present but not at position 3? Then we know it must be at 1,2, or 5? And then we have to guess again? That's okay? We have 4 more guesses? So it's acceptable.

  Alternatively, we might spread letters? But we are using 4 new letters and one we know? That's efficient.

  We'll go with ""BUSHY"".<thinking>
Based on the feedback:

- First guess ""crane"": All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word contains none of these letters.
- Second guess ""moist"": 
  - M, O, I, T are absent → excluded.
  - S is present but in the wrong position (since marked as ""-"") → this confirms S is in the word, but not in the 4th position (as guessed in ""moist"").

Now, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word must contain S (somewhere except position 4) and use letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess:
1. Must include S but avoid position 4 to test its new potential locations (1, 2, 3, or 5).
2. Should prioritize testing common unused consonants (B, H, L) and vowels (U) from the remaining letters.
3. Avoid repeating excluded letters and reuse S strategically.

After evaluating options:
- ""BUSHY"" (B, U, S, H, Y) fits best:
  - Includes S at position 3 (untested position).
  - Tests new common letters: B, U, H, Y.
  - B and H are high-frequency consonants; U is a common vowel.
  - Valid English word (meaning overgrown with bushes).

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities for S while gathering new letter data.
</thinking>

<guess>bushy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)
Guess 3: bushy -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. ""crane"": all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). So the secret word has none of these.
2. ""moist"": M, O, I, T are absent (x), and S is present but not in the correct position (S(-)). So the secret word contains S, but not at position 4 (since in ""moist"", S was at position 4).
3. ""bushy"": 
   - B is absent (x)
   - U is correct and in the correct position (U(✓) at position 2)
   - S is present but not in the correct position (S(-) at position 3) -> so S is in the word, but not at position 3 (and we already know not at position 4 from the previous guess)
   - H is absent (x)
   - Y is correct and in the correct position (Y(✓) at position 5)

So from ""bushy"", we know:
- Position 2 is U (fixed)
- Position 5 is Y (fixed)
- The word contains S, but not at position 3 or 4 (and not at 2 or 5 because they are fixed as U and Y). Therefore, S must be at position 1? Because that's the only position left? The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
  - Position 2: U
  - Position 5: Y
  - Position 3: not S (from ""bushy"" feedback)
  - Position 4: not S (from ""moist"" feedback)
  - Therefore, S must be at position 1.

But wait, we have only 5 positions. So if S is not at 2,3,4,5, then it must be at 1. So we can deduce that the secret word has S at position 1.

Additionally, we have the following information:
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B, H (from the x's in all guesses). 
  - From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E
  - From ""moist"": M, O, I, T
  - From ""bushy"": B, H
  - So total excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B, H.

- The secret word has: 
  - Position 1: S (as deduced)
  - Position 2: U
  - Position 5: Y
  - And we know the word contains S (which we now know is at position 1) and we have two more letters to find: at position 3 and 4.

- The letters at positions 3 and 4 must be from the remaining available letters, excluding the ones we know and the excluded ones.

Available letters: We have used S, U, Y (and they are fixed). Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B,H.

Remaining letters: D, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, X, Z. (and possibly others? Let's list the alphabet: A to Z, remove the excluded: 
Excluded: A,B,C,E,H,I,M,N,O,R,T -> so remaining: D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But note: S, U, Y are already in the word, so for positions 3 and 4, we need to choose from the remaining available that are not excluded and not already placed? But we can use letters that are not in the word? Actually, we don't know if they are in the word? We are to find two new letters.

But note: we have already placed S, U, Y. So the secret word is: S _ _ _ Y, with the second letter U? Actually, position 2 is U and position 5 is Y, and position 1 is S. So the word is: S U _ _ Y.

Now, the two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) must be two letters from the remaining available set, and they must form a valid English word.

The available letters (not excluded and not already in the word? But we don't know if the word has duplicates? But we have no information about duplicates so far? So we assume no duplicates? Or we can have duplicates? But we haven't seen any yet? However, we must consider the possibility? But to be safe, we can avoid duplicates? But the feedback doesn't show any duplicates? So let's assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we have to consider that the word might have duplicates? But we haven't encountered any? So we can try without duplicates first.

Available letters for positions 3 and 4: from the set of letters not excluded and not already in the word? The word already has S, U, Y. So we avoid using these again? But if the word has duplicates, we can? But we don't know? So we can try without duplicates.

So available letters: D, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, X, Z. (and also J, Q? But we didn't list them? Let me list all letters and remove the excluded and the used ones.

Alphabet: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Excluded: A,B,C,E,H,I,M,N,O,R,T

So available: D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But wait, we have already placed S, U, Y in the word? So if we assume no duplicates, then we cannot use S, U, Y again? So for positions 3 and 4, we must choose from: D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

But note: we are not forced to avoid duplicates? The word might have duplicates? But we have no evidence? So we can try without duplicates? But we have to form a valid word.

The word must be of the form: S U ? ? Y

We need to find two letters (say L1 and L2) such that ""SU"" + L1 + L2 + ""Y"" is a valid English word.

Possible words: 
  - SULLY: S U L L Y -> but L repeated? And L is available? But we have two L's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? Also, we haven't tested L? But in ""SULLY"", we have L at position 3 and 4? But we are to find two distinct letters? Or not necessarily? Actually, they can be the same? But we don't know.

But let's check: ""SULLY"" is a word? Yes. But we have two L's? So we would be using L twice? And we haven't tested L? So we don't know if L is in the word? But we are about to test? But we are making a guess? So we can try? But we have to see if it fits.

But note: we have not excluded L? So it's possible.

But we have other options? 

We can list possible words: 
  - SULKY: S U L K Y -> but K is available? And we haven't used K? So that's a possibility? And no duplicates? So ""SULKY"" is a valid word.

  - SULPHY? Not a word? Or SULPHY is not common? 

  - SUDDY? Not a word.

  - SUGGY? Not a word.

  - SULFY? Not a word.

  - SULPH? Not 5 letters? SULPH is 5? S,U,L,P,H -> but H is excluded? So invalid.

  - SULKY: S U L K Y -> valid.

  - SUNNY: but N is excluded? And we have two N's? But N is excluded -> invalid.

  - SURFY: but R is excluded -> invalid.

  - SUPPLY? 6 letters? No.

  - SUPPY? Not a word.

  - SULFA: but A is excluded -> invalid.

  - SULKS: but S is repeated? And we have S at position 1? So if we put S at position 4? But we know position 4 is not S? Because from ""moist"" we know S is not at position 4? And from ""bushy"" we know S is not at position 3? And we now have S at position 1? So if we put S at position 4 again? That would be invalid? Because we know position 4 is not S? So ""SULKS"" would have S at position 1 and 4? But position 4 cannot be S? So that's not possible? So we avoid.

  - SULKY: seems a good candidate? But we have to check if K is available? Yes, not excluded.

  - Other words: SUDOR? Not 5? S U D O R -> O and R excluded? Invalid.

  - SUDDS? Not a word? And D repeated? And we don't know D? But ""sudds"" is not a word? The word is ""sudd"" (but that's 4 letters).

  - SUKHS? S U K H S -> H excluded? and S repeated? and position 4 is H? But H is excluded? So invalid.

  - SULCI? but I excluded? invalid.

  - SULUS? S U L U S -> U repeated? and S repeated? and we have U at position 2? So if we put U at position 3? But we don't know? But the word would be ""SULUS""? Not a common word? And we have U at position 2 and 3? But we already have U at position 2? So if the secret word has two U's? But we don't know? But ""SULUS"" is not a valid English word? I think not.

  - So ""SULKY"" is a strong candidate.

But wait, we have Y at the end? And in ""SULKY"", we have Y at the end? So that matches? And we have U at position 2? And S at position 1? So the word would be S U L K Y.

Now, we need to check if L and K are available? They are not excluded? And we haven't used them? So we can test them.

But note: we have not tested L and K? So we are using two new letters? That's good? We are testing them.

Alternatively, we could try a word that uses more common letters? But we don't have many options? Because the available letters are limited.

Another word: ""SUGAR""? But A and R excluded? invalid.

""SULFA"": A excluded? invalid.

""SUMAC"": A and C excluded? invalid.

""SUMPH"": H excluded? invalid.

""SUMPT"": U and T? T excluded? invalid.

So ""SULKY"" seems a valid option.

But we have to consider: we have two positions to fill? And we are guessing the entire word? So we can guess ""SULKY"".

But note: we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess? We have used 3? So we have 3 more? But we are allowed 6? So we can try.

But if we are confident? We have deduced that position 1 must be S? Because S must be at 1? Let me reconfirm:

- We know S is in the word? And the positions are 1,2,3,4,5.
- We know position 2 is U (from ""bushy"" U✓ at position 2).
- We know position 5 is Y (from ""bushy"" Y✓ at position 5).
- We know S is not at position 3 (from ""bushy"" S- at position 3) and not at position 4 (from ""moist"" S- at position 4).
- Therefore, the only position left for S is position 1? Yes.

So the word must start with S, then U, then two letters, then Y.

So the word is S U ? ? Y.

Now, we need to fill the two middle letters? And we have a candidate: ""SULKY"" (S U L K Y).

But is ""SULKY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning sullen or morose? And it's 5 letters.

We can also consider ""SUDSY""? But D and S? S repeated? And we have S at position 1? So if we put S at position 4? But we know position 4 is not S? So ""SUDSY"" would be S U D S Y -> but position 4 is S? Which we know is not? So invalid? So we cannot use that.

Another: ""SUCKY""? But C is excluded? invalid.

""SULKY"" is the best candidate? Or ""SULLY""? But ""SULLY"" has two L's? So S U L L Y? That would be a valid word? Meaning to soil or defile? And we haven't tested L? So we can try? But we have two possibilities? We don't know which one? But we can only guess one? So we have to choose one? 

But note: we have two guesses? We can try one? But we are on the fourth guess? We have two more after? So we can try ""SULKY"" and if it's wrong, we try ""SULLY""? But that might be inefficient? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests the two positions without committing to a specific word? But we have to guess a valid word? And we have to include the fixed letters? So we cannot avoid? Because we have to have S at 1, U at 2, Y at 5? So the word must be of the form S U ? ? Y.

So we have to choose the two middle letters? And we have limited options? 

Possible words with the available letters (without duplicates? and without excluded letters? and without using S,U,Y again? if we assume no duplicates?):

- S U L K Y -> SULKY
- S U L L Y -> SULLY (but duplicate L? so if we allow duplicates? but we don't know? but it's a valid word? and we haven't tested L? so we can try? but we have to choose one? 
- S U P P Y? Not a word? 
- S U W W Y? Not a word?
- S U G G Y? Not a word? 
- S U D D Y? Not a word? 
- S U F F Y? F is available? and ""SUFFY"" is not a word? 
- S U L P H? H excluded? invalid? 
- S U B B Y? B excluded? invalid? 
- S U M M Y? M excluded? invalid? 
- S U R R Y? R excluded? invalid? 
- S U V V Y? Not a word? 
- S U Z Z Y? Z is available? and ""SUZZY"" is not a word? 
- S U K K Y? Not a word? 
- S U L F Y? F is available? but ""SULFY"" is not a word? 
- S U L P Y? P is available? ""SULPY"" is not a word? 
- S U L K Y and S U L L Y are the only common ones? 

So we have two candidates: SULKY and SULLY.

How to decide? We can try one? 

But note: we have feedback that might help? We don't have any information about L or K? So we have to guess? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use L? But then what? For example, ""SUQ"" words? Not many? 

We can try ""SULKY"" because it uses two distinct new letters? So we get more information? But if it's wrong, we can try SULLY? 

But we have two guesses left? We are about to make the fourth guess? Then we have two more? So we can try SULKY? 

But if we are lucky, it might be correct? 

Alternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses two different letters? Like S U D G Y? But ""sudgy"" is not a word? 

Or S U P P Y? Not a word? 

So we have to choose between SULKY and SULLY? 

But note: in SULLY, we are using L twice? So if the word has L, then we might get feedback? But we don't know? 

But we can also consider: we have not tested the letter L? So if we guess SULKY, and if the word is SULLY, then we would get:
  - S: ✓ (position 1)
  - U: ✓ (position 2)
  - L: but in SULKY we have L at position 3? and in SULLY, L is at position 3 and 4? So for the guess SULKY:
      Position 3: L -> in SULLY, position 3 is L? so that would be ✓? 
      Position 4: K -> in SULLY, position 4 is L? so K is not in the word? so K(x)
      Position 5: Y: ✓
  So feedback: S(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓) -> so we would know that the word is S U L ? Y? and the fourth letter is not K? and we know it must be L? because we have only two options? So we can then guess SULLY? 

Similarly, if we guess SULLY and the word is SULKY, then:
  - S(✓), U(✓), L at position 3: in SULKY, position 3 is L? so if the word is SULKY, then position 3 is L? so L(✓) for position 3? 
  - Then position 4: L? in SULKY, position 4 is K? so L is not at position 4? but we have two L's? So the feedback might mark the first L as ✓ and the second L as x? Because the word has only one L? Or if the word has one L? But SULKY has one L? So in SULLY, we have two L's? So for the guess SULLY against SULKY:
      Position 1: S(✓)
      Position 2: U(✓)
      Position 3: L(✓) because SULKY has L at position 3? 
      Position 4: L -> but SULKY does not have a second L? so L is absent? so L(x)
      Position 5: Y(✓)
  So feedback: S(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(x) Y(✓) -> so we know the word has only one L? and it is at position 3? and position 4 is not L? and we know it must be K? because we have only two options? So we can then guess SULKY? 

So in either case, we can get the word in the next guess? 

But we are making the fourth guess? So we have two more? So we can choose either? 

But to be efficient? We can choose one arbitrarily? 

Let me choose ""SULKY"" as the fourth guess? 

So guess: SULKY

If it's correct, we win? If not, we get feedback and then we can guess SULLY? 

But note: there might be other words? For example, ""SUDGY"" is not a word? Or ""SUGNY""? Not a word? 

Another possibility: ""SUCKY"" but C excluded? invalid? 

Or ""SUMPY""? Not a word? 

So I think SULKY and SULLY are the only two common words? 

Therefore, we guess ""SULKY"". 

But wait, we have the letter G? We haven't tested G? But we don't have a word ""SUG_Y""? 

Similarly, P? ""SUP_Y""? Not a word? 

So we are safe? 

So let's go with ""SULKY"". 

But note: we have to output the guess? 

So: <guess>sulky</guess>

But let me double-check the feedback we have? 

We are confident that the word is S U ? ? Y? and the only two options are SULKY and SULLY? 

Yes? 

So we try SULKY? 

But if the word is SULLY, we will know? 

So we make the guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → excluded.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**: M, O, I, T are absent → excluded. S is present but not in position 4 (S(-)).
- **Guess 3 (bushy)**: 
  - B and H are absent → excluded.
  - U is correct and in position 2 (U(✓)).
  - S is present but not in position 3 (S(-)).
  - Y is correct and in position 5 (Y(✓)).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**: 
   - Position 2 must be **U**.
   - Position 5 must be **Y**.
2. **S placement**: 
   - S is in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). 
   - With positions 2 and 5 fixed, and S absent from positions 3 and 4, **S must be at position 1**.
3. **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B, H (all marked absent).
4. **Word structure**: The secret word is **S U _ _ Y**.
5. **Available letters for positions 3–4**: D, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, X, Z (not excluded and not used in fixed positions).

### Analysis:
- The only common English words fitting **S U _ _ Y** are **SULKY** (sullen) and **SULLY** (to tarnish). 
- **SULKY** tests two new letters (L and K) and avoids duplicates, maximizing information gain. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if L or K are present, narrowing to **SULLY**.
- Given the constraints, **SULKY** is the optimal guess to resolve the remaining uncertainty.

Let\'s try ""TOILS"" or ""STOMP"".\n\n However, note that we have 6 tries, so we can try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me list some common letters we haven\'t used: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H, Y, F, K, V, W, X, Z (but X and Z are less common).\n\n We can try a word that uses 5 of the most common remaining letters.\n\n According to letter frequency in English, after removing C, R, A, N, E, the next most common are: S, T, L, O, I, D, U, M, P, B, G, H.\n\n We can try: ""SIGHT"" -> S, I, G, H, T.

However, we have excluded letters? K, U, L are not excluded, but we have two L\'s -> but the word may have repeated letters? We don\'t know, but it\'s allowed.\n\n But note: we have not encountered repeated letters in feedback so far, but the secret word might have repeats.\n\n How about ""SLUMP""? But M is excluded -> invalid.\n\n Let\'s list possible words:\n\n  We have to use S and avoid excluded letters.\n\n Some ideas:\n\n - ""SALAD"" -> but A is excluded -> invalid.\n - ""SHYLY"" -> S, H, Y, L, Y -> Y twice, and H, Y, L are available. But is SHYLY allowed? It\'s a valid word.\n\n However, we want to cover multiple common letters. Let\'s try:\n\n - ""SKULK"": S, K, U, L, K -> two K\'s. Valid?\n - ""SPLIT"": but P is available, L, I (excluded) -> I is excluded, invalid.\n\n Since I is excluded, we can\'t use I.\n\n Another: ""SHOWY"" -> S, H, O, W, Y -> but O is excluded -> invalid.\n\n We are avoiding O because it\'s excluded.\n\n After excluding M,O,I,T, and first set, we must use letters from: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n Let\'s try to form words:\n\n - ""SULKY"": S, U, L, K, Y -> all allowed? Yes. And S is at position 1. But note: we need to avoid the 4th position for S? Our S can be anywhere except position 4. So position 1 is fine.\n\n However, ""SULKY"" has U, L, K, Y. Also, we don\'t know if U, L, K, Y are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""SWUNG"": S, W, U, N, G -> but N is excluded -> invalid.\n\n How about ""SHULK""? Not a common word.\n\n ""SIGHT"": but I and G? I is excluded -> invalid.\n\n Another: ""SKULK"" might be acceptable? Or ""SKYED""? But less common.\n\n Let\'s consider: ""LYSSA"" -> but not 5 letters? Actually, L-Y-S-S-A -> but A is excluded.\n\n Alternatively, ""PALSY"": P, A, L, S, Y -> A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n How about ""SLUSH"": S, L, U, S, H -> but S repeated? And H. So: S at positions 1 and 4? But we cannot have S at position 4 because the feedback for ""moist"" marked S as present but not in the 4th position. However, if the word has two S\'s, then the feedback for ""moist"" only tells us that one S is not at position 4. So having S at position 4 might be allowed if there is another S? Actually, no: because the feedback for ""moist"" only shows one S (since we had one S) -> so if there were two S\'s in the secret word, we would have gotten two ""-"" or one ""✓"" and one ""-"", etc. But we got only one S marked as ""-"", so that means at least one S is in the word and it\'s not in position 4. If the secret word has two S\'s, then one S is not at position 4, but the other could be anywhere. However, we know that in ""moist"", only one S is present in the word? Because only one was marked. Actually, a ""-"" means that letter is in the word but not in that position, but it doesn\'t tell you if there are duplicates. But note: the standard Wordle behavior is that if you have duplicate letters, only the necessary number of markers are shown. However, in our rules, we haven\'t specified that. Since we are building this, let me clarify from the rules: The feedback symbol applies to each letter independently? But note the example: Secret word: BRISK, guess: STORM -> feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x). There is only one S in BRISK? Actually BRISK doesn\'t have S? Wait, the example: STORM for BRISK: S is in the word? BRISK does not have S? So let me check: secret word BRISK vs guess STORM. The S is not in BRISK? Then why is S marked as ""-""? That\'s a mistake? Actually, in the example: \n   Secret Word: BRISK\n   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)\nBut BRISK doesn\'t have S? That would be an error.\n\n Wait, I see: The example says:\n   Secret Word: BRISK\n   Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)\n\n But BRISK has the letters B, R, I, S, K. So:\n   S: is in the word but not in the first position? In STORM, S is first, and in BRISK, S is fourth -> so it\'s present but not at position 1 -> so S(-) is correct.\n   T: is not in BRISK -> T(x)\n   O: not in BRISK -> O(x)\n   R: in BRISK at position 2, but in STORM at position 4 -> so R(-)\n   M: not in BRISK -> M(x)\n\n So the feedback is correct.\n\n Back to our case: In ""moist"", the word has one S. We got one ""-"" for S. This means the secret word has at least one S, and it is not in the 4th position. But if the secret word has two S\'s, then one S might be at a position we haven\'t guessed? That\'s possible. So we cannot completely rule out S at position 4? Actually, we can. Because in our guess ""moist"", we have only one S. If the secret word had two S\'s, then we would have gotten feedback for both? But note: the feedback might prioritize one occurrence.\n\n Standard Wordle feedback: \n   For duplicate letters: \n     If the guess has two of the same letter, and the word has one, then one is marked as ""-"" or ""✓"" and the other as ""x"". \n     If the word has two, and the guess has two, but only one is in the right position, then one might be ✓ and the other -. \n   But in our case, we only have one S in the guess. So we got one S marked with ""-"", meaning:\n        There is at least one S in the secret word, and it is not in the fourth position.\n\n   It does not preclude the secret word having a second S. But if it has a second S, then it could be at position 4? \n   However, if the secret word had an S at the fourth position, then in the guess ""moist"" at the fourth position (which is S) would have been marked ✓, because it would be correct. But we didn\'t get ✓, we got -. So that S is in the word but not at position 4. Thus, the secret word cannot have an S at position 4? Actually, yes: because if it did, then the S at position 4 in the guess would be correct and we would have gotten a ✓. So the position 4 in the secret word is not S.\n\n   Therefore, we know for sure that the secret word has S but not at position 4, and position 4 is not S.\n\n   Also, we don\'t know about other positions. But since we only have one S in the guess, if the word has two S\'s, that\'s okay, but we haven\'t tested the position of the second S? So we can\'t rule out S at other positions? Actually, the positions we haven\'t tested could be S? But note: we tested only position 4? In ""moist"", S was at 4. So any other position is untested.\n\n   Therefore, in our next guess, we can put S at positions 1,2,3, or 5.\n\n Now, back to forming a word:\n\n We need a word that: \n   contains S (at least one) and places it not at position 4? Actually, we are allowed to put it anywhere except that we cannot put it at position 4? Actually, we know that position 4 is not S? Actually, we don\'t know about position 4 being not S? We only know that the S from our guess (which was at position 4) is not in the right place. But the secret word might have an S at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:\n\n   The feedback told us that the S in our guess at position 4 is in the word (so the word has S) but it is not at position 4. This does not tell us anything about position 4 of the secret word? It could be any letter. It might even be another S? No, because if position 4 of the secret word was S, then our guess had S at position 4 and that would be a match (✓). We didn\'t get a match, so the secret word\'s position 4 is not S.\n\n Therefore, the secret word has an S, but position 4 of the secret word is not S. And our guess must avoid putting S at position 4? Actually, we can put S at position 4 again, but that would be silly because we know it\'s not there? So we avoid that.\n\n And also, the secret word might have S in two positions? Then we might guess S at two positions? But currently we have no information on other positions.\n\n Since we want to test other letters, we might avoid putting two S\'s in our guess until we know more? Because we are limited by the number of letters we can test.\n\n Let\'s pick a word with one S (at first, last, or positions 2 or 3) and four other new letters.\n\n Given the constraints, I propose:\n\n  ""SHULK"": but HULK? Valid? Or ""SHULK"" is not a word.\n\n  ""SKYED"": not so common.\n\n  ""SPLIT"": but I is excluded.\n\n  How about ""SWAMP"": but A and M are excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BULKS"": B, U, L, K, S -> that\'s a valid word (bulks). And S is at the end (position 5). Letters: B, U, L, K, S -> all allowed. Also, we haven\'t used these letters.\n\n  Alternatively, ""FLUSH"": F, L, U, S, H -> valid? and S at position 4? But we cannot put S at position 4? Because we know position 4 of the secret is not S? So we must avoid S at position 4? Therefore, ""FLUSH"" has S at position 4 -> invalid guess? Actually, we can guess it? But we already know that position 4 is not S, so it would be wasteful? Actually, the guess must be valid 5-letter word, but it can have S at position 4? It\'s allowed, but we know that letter will be marked as either:\n      x: if the word doesn\'t have a second S? \n      or -: if the word has a second S? \n   But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s? It\'s risky? Maybe we can avoid it to use S in a new position.\n\n  Better to put S in a position we haven\'t tested: positions 1,2,3, or 5.\n\n  So ""BULKS"": S at position 5 -> good.\n\n  Also, ""LUCKS"": L, U, C, K, S -> but C is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""DUMPS"": D, U, M, P, S -> but M is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""BUSKS"": B, U, S, K, S -> repeated S? But we are testing S again. Not ideal? But valid word? Also, we have S at positions 3 and 5.\n\n  However, we want to test new letters. So ""BULKS"" tests B, U, L, K, and S at end.\n\n  Another word: ""GUPSY""? Not common.\n\n  ""SKULK"": valid? means to avoid work? We already thought of that. But it has S at position 1.\n\n  But ""SKULK"" has two K\'s? And K is not excluded.\n\n  Alternatively, ""HYPES"": H, Y, P, E, S -> E is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  ""WISPY"": but W,I,S,P,Y -> I is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  So ""BULKS"" seems okay? Or ""SKULK""?\n\n  Let me check: ""SPLUG""? Not so common.\n\n  ""SLUBS"": S, L, U, B, S -> repeated S? Valid, meaning links in a chain? But rare.\n\n  Better to choose a more common word.\n\n  How about ""SULKS"": S, U, L, K, S -> also repetitive? Meaning to be sulky? Valid? But we get to test U, L, K? And S at positions 1 and 5. But note: we are testing the same letter S twice? We already know S is in the word, so we might not gain much by testing two S\'s? We should avoid to save testing new letters.\n\n  Therefore, without repeated S: ""BULKS"" or ""BLUSH"": BLUSH has S at position 5? Wait, B, L, U, S, H -> so S at position 4? But position 4 of the secret is not S? So we avoid S at position 4 -> ""BLUSH"" puts S at position 4 -> don\'t use.\n\n  Instead, ""BUSHY"": B, U, S, H, Y -> S at position 3 -> okay. And letters B, U, S, H, Y -> all allowed.\n\n  Is ""BUSH Y""? Actually, BUSHY is a valid word.\n\n  So ""BUSHY"": positions: 1:B, 2:U, 3:S, 4:H, 5:Y.\n\n  Alternatively, ""PUSHY"": but P,U,S,H,Y -> similar.\n\n  But note: we have not tried U, H, Y? They are new.\n\n  Which word to pick? We have:\n\n      Option 1: ""BULKS"" -> B, U, L, K, S (with S at 5)\n      Option 2: ""BUSKY""? Not common.\n      Option 3: ""BUSHY"" -> B, U, S, H, Y (S at 3)\n\n  Both are valid. Let\'s choose the one that tests more common letters.\n\n  Since B, U, L, K, S, H, Y are all available.\n\n  Common letters: B, H, U, L, Y? H and L are common.\n\n  ""BUSHY"" tests U, S, H, Y, and B? And S is at position 3. We haven\'t tested position 3 for S? So that\'s good.\n\n  Similarly, ""BULKS"" tests U at position 2, L at 3, K at 4, S at 5? And we haven\'t tested positions 1,2,3,4 for letters? Actually, we did test position 4 in ""moist""? We know position 4 of the secret is not S? But we don\'t know what it is? So testing position 4 with a new letter K is good.\n\n  Both seem acceptable.\n\n  Let me lean toward ""BULKS"": because it uses L and K which are common? Or H might be more common than K? Actually, according to typical frequency, H is more common than K.\n\n  But we want to maximize information? Actually, both are unplayed.\n\n  Another option: ""SHYLY"" -> S at the start? But it has Y repeated? But valid word? Meaning in a shy manner? It\'s an adverb? Might be acceptable.\n\n  To be safe, I\'ll go with ""BUSHY"": because it\'s a common word.\n\n  But wait, S is at position 3? And we haven\'t tried S at 3? And position 4 is H? Which we haven\'t tested? And we know position 4 in the secret is not S? So H is a new letter? So we test H.\n\n  Alternatively, ""BLUES"" -> but E is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  Final decision: ""BUSHY"".\n\n  Alternatively, a word without S? Doesn\'t make sense? We must include S? Because we know it\'s in the word? So we have to include S.\n\n  So guess: ""bushy"".\n\n  But note: in ""BUSHY"", the S is at position 3? We might hit if the S is at 3? But we don\'t know.\n\n  Or we might get feedback that S is at a different position? Either way.\n\n  So:\n\n   Guess: BUSHY\n\n   If the feedback tells us about B, U, S, H, Y.\n\n   Especially, if S is in the word and at position 3? Then we get a ✓? Otherwise, if S is elsewhere? Then we get a - for S? But we know S is in the word? So we might get either ✓ or - at position 3? And if we get ✓, we lock position 3 is S? That would be great? But it might not be.\n\n  Alternatively, if we put S at a new position, we can get information? We did position 4? So positions 1,2,3,5 are untested? So we want to test one of them? ""BUSHY"" tests position 3? Good.\n\n  Therefore, let\'s choose ""BUSHY"".\n\n  However, note: the secret word might have S at position 1 or 2 or 5? We haven\'t tested them? So we might get feedback that S is present but not at position 3? Then we know it must be at 1,2, or 5? And then we have to guess again? That\'s okay? We have 4 more guesses? So it\'s acceptable.\n\n  Alternatively, we might spread letters? But we are using 4 new letters and one we know? That\'s efficient.\n\n  We\'ll go with ""BUSHY"".<thinking>\nBased on the feedback:\n\n- First guess ""crane"": All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. So the secret word contains none of these letters.\n- Second guess ""moist"": \n  - M, O, I, T are absent → excluded.\n  - S is present but in the wrong position (since marked as ""-"") → this confirms S is in the word, but not in the 4th position (as guessed in ""moist"").\n\nNow, the excluded letters are: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T. The secret word must contain S (somewhere except position 4) and use letters from the remaining pool: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor the new guess:\n1. Must include S but avoid position 4 to test its new potential locations (1, 2, 3, or 5).\n2. Should prioritize testing common unused consonants (B, H, L) and vowels (U) from the remaining letters.\n3. Avoid repeating excluded letters and reuse S strategically.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""BUSHY"" (B, U, S, H, Y) fits best:\n  - Includes S at position 3 (untested position).\n  - Tests new common letters: B, U, H, Y.\n  - B and H are high-frequency consonants; U is a common vowel.\n  - Valid English word (meaning overgrown with bushes).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows possibilities for S while gathering new letter data.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>bushy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(x) S(-) T(x)\nGuess 3: bushy -> FEEDBACK: B(x) U(✓) S(-) H(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n\n1.

""bushy"": \n   - B is absent (x)\n   - U is correct and in the correct position (U(✓) at position 2)\n   - S is present but not in the correct position (S(-) at position 3) -> so S is in the word, but not at position 3 (and we already know not at position 4 from the previous guess)\n   - H is absent (x)\n   - Y is correct and in the correct position (Y(✓) at position 5)\n\nSo from ""bushy"", we know:\n- Position 2 is U (fixed)\n- Position 5 is Y (fixed)\n- The word contains S, but not at position 3 or 4 (and not at 2 or 5 because they are fixed as U and Y). Therefore, S must be at position 1? Because that\'s the only position left? The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We know:\n  - Position 2: U\n  - Position 5: Y\n  - Position 3: not S (from ""bushy"" feedback)\n  - Position 4: not S (from ""moist"" feedback)\n  - Therefore, S must be at position 1.\n\nBut wait, we have only 5 positions. So if S is not at 2,3,4,5, then it must be at 1. So we can deduce that the secret word has S at position 1.\n\nAdditionally, we have the following information:\n- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B, H (from the x\'s in all guesses). \n  - From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E\n  - From ""moist"": M, O, I, T\n  - From ""bushy"": B, H\n  - So total excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B, H.\n\n- The secret word has: \n  - Position 1: S (as deduced)\n  - Position 2: U\n  - Position 5: Y\n  - And we know the word contains S (which we now know is at position 1) and we have two more letters to find: at position 3 and 4.\n\n- The letters at positions 3 and 4 must be from the remaining available letters, excluding the ones we know and the excluded ones.\n\nAvailable letters: We have used S, U, Y (and they are fixed). Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B,H.\n\nRemaining letters: D, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, X, Z. (and possibly others? Let\'s list the alphabet: A to Z, remove the excluded: \nExcluded: A,B,C,E,H,I,M,N,O,R,T -> so remaining: D,F,G,J,K,L,P,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But note: S, U, Y are already in the word, so for positions 3 and 4, we need to choose from the remaining available that are not excluded and not already placed? But we can use letters that are not in the word? Actually, we don\'t know if they are in the word? We are to find two new letters.\n\nBut note: we have already placed S, U, Y. So the secret word is: S _ _ _ Y, with the second letter U? Actually, position 2 is U and position 5 is Y, and position 1 is S. So the word is: S U _ _ Y.\n\nNow, the two middle letters (positions 3 and 4) must be two letters from the remaining available set, and they must form a valid English word.\n\nThe available letters (not excluded and not already in the word? But we don\'t know if the word has duplicates? But we have no information about duplicates so far? So we assume no duplicates? Or we can have duplicates? But we haven\'t seen any yet? However, we must consider the possibility? But to be safe, we can avoid duplicates? But the feedback doesn\'t show any duplicates? So let\'s assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we have to consider that the word might have duplicates? But we haven\'t encountered any? So we can try without duplicates first.\n\nAvailable letters for positions 3 and 4: from the set of letters not excluded and not already in the word? The word already has S, U, Y. So we avoid using these again? But if the word has duplicates, we can? But we don\'t know? So we can try without duplicates.\n\nSo available letters: D, F, G, K, L, P, V, W, X, Z. (and also J, Q? But we didn\'t list them? Let me list all letters and remove the excluded and the used ones.\n\nAlphabet: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nExcluded: A,B,C,E,H,I,M,N,O,R,T\n\nSo available: D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But wait, we have already placed S, U, Y in the word? So if we assume no duplicates, then we cannot use S, U, Y again? So for positions 3 and 4, we must choose from: D, F, G, J, K, L, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nBut note: we are not forced to avoid duplicates? The word might have duplicates? But we have no evidence? So we can try without duplicates? But we have to form a valid word.\n\nThe word must be of the form: S U ? ? Y\n\nWe need to find two letters (say L1 and L2) such that ""SU"" + L1 + L2 + ""Y"" is a valid English word.\n\nPossible words: \n  - SULLY: S U L L Y -> but L repeated? And L is available? But we have two L\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? Also, we haven\'t tested L? But in ""SULLY"", we have L at position 3 and 4? But we are to find two distinct letters? Or not necessarily? Actually, they can be the same? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s check: ""SULLY"" is a word? Yes. But we have two L\'s? So we would be using L twice? And we haven\'t tested L? So we don\'t know if L is in the word? But we are about to test? But we are making a guess? So we can try? But we have to see if it fits.\n\nBut note: we have not excluded L? So it\'s possible.\n\nBut we have other options? \n\nWe can list possible words: \n  - SULKY: S U L K Y -> but K is available? And we haven\'t used K? So that\'s a possibility? And no duplicates? So ""SULKY"" is a valid word.\n\n  - SULPHY? Not a word? Or SULPHY is not common? \n\n  - SUDDY? Not a word.\n\n  - SUGGY? Not a word.\n\n  - SULFY? Not a word.\n\n  - SULPH? Not 5 letters? SULPH is 5? S,U,L,P,H -> but H is excluded? So invalid.\n\n  - SULKY: S U L K Y -> valid.\n\n  - SUNNY: but N is excluded? And we have two N\'s? But N is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  - SURFY: but R is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  - SUPPLY? 6 letters? No.\n\n  - SUPPY? Not a word.\n\n  - SULFA: but A is excluded -> invalid.\n\n  - SULKS: but S is repeated? And we have S at position 1? So if we put S at position 4? But we know position 4 is not S? Because from ""moist"" we know S is not at position 4? And from ""bushy"" we know S is not at position 3? And we now have S at position 1? So if we put S at position 4 again? That would be invalid? Because we know position 4 is not S? So ""SULKS"" would have S at position 1 and 4? But position 4 cannot be S? So that\'s not possible? So we avoid.\n\n  - SULKY: seems a good candidate? But we have to check if K is available? Yes, not excluded.\n\n  - Other words: SUDOR? Not 5? S U D O R -> O and R excluded? Invalid.\n\n  - SUDDS? Not a word? And D repeated? And we don\'t know D? But ""sudds"" is not a word? The word is ""sudd"" (but that\'s 4 letters).\n\n  - SUKHS? S U K H S -> H excluded? and S repeated? and position 4 is H? But H is excluded? So invalid.\n\n  - SULCI? but I excluded? invalid.\n\n  - SULUS? S U L U S -> U repeated? and S repeated? and we have U at position 2? So if we put U at position 3? But we don\'t know? But the word would be ""SULUS""? Not a common word? And we have U at position 2 and 3? But we already have U at position 2? So if the secret word has two U\'s? But we don\'t know? But ""SULUS"" is not a valid English word? I think not.\n\n  - So ""SULKY"" is a strong candidate.\n\nBut wait, we have Y at the end? And in ""SULKY"", we have Y at the end? So that matches? And we have U at position 2? And S at position 1? So the word would be S U L K Y.\n\nNow, we need to check if L and K are available? They are not excluded? And we haven\'t used them? So we can test them.\n\nBut note: we have not tested L and K? So we are using two new letters? That\'s good? We are testing them.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that uses more common letters? But we don\'t have many options? Because the available letters are limited.\n\nAnother word: ""SUGAR""? But A and R excluded? invalid.\n\n""SULFA"": A excluded? invalid.\n\n""SUMAC"": A and C excluded? invalid.\n\n""SUMPH"": H excluded? invalid.\n\n""SUMPT"": U and T? T excluded? invalid.\n\nSo ""SULKY"" seems a valid option.\n\nBut we have to consider: we have two positions to fill? And we are guessing the entire word? So we can guess ""SULKY"".\n\nBut note: we have 3 guesses left? Actually, we are on the fourth guess? We have used 3? So we have 3 more? But we are allowed 6? So we can try.\n\nBut if we are confident? We have deduced that position 1 must be S? Because S must be at 1? Let me reconfirm:\n\n- We know S is in the word? And the positions are 1,2,3,4,5.\n- We know position 2 is U (from ""bushy"" U✓ at position 2).\n- We know position 5 is Y (from ""bushy"" Y✓ at position 5).\n- We know S is not at position 3 (from ""bushy"" S- at position 3) and not at position 4 (from ""moist"" S- at position 4).\n- Therefore, the only position left for S is position 1? Yes.\n\nSo the word must start with S, then U, then two letters, then Y.\n\nSo the word is S U ? ? Y.\n\nNow, we need to fill the two middle letters? And we have a candidate: ""SULKY"" (S U L K Y).\n\nBut is ""SULKY"" a valid word? Yes, meaning sullen or morose? And it\'s 5 letters.\n\nWe can also consider ""SUDSY""? But D and S? S repeated? And we have S at position 1? So if we put S at position 4? But we know position 4 is not S? So ""SUDSY"" would be S U D S Y -> but position 4 is S? Which we know is not? So invalid? So we cannot use that.\n\nAnother: ""SUCKY""? But C is excluded? invalid.\n\n""SULKY"" is the best candidate? Or ""SULLY""? But ""SULLY"" has two L\'s? So S U L L Y? That would be a valid word? Meaning to soil or defile? And we haven\'t tested L? So we can try? But we have two possibilities? We don\'t know which one? But we can only guess one? So we have to choose one? \n\nBut note: we have two guesses? We can try one? But we are on the fourth guess? We have two more after? So we can try ""SULKY"" and if it\'s wrong, we try ""SULLY""? But that might be inefficient? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests the two positions without committing to a specific word? But we have to guess a valid word? And we have to include the fixed letters? So we cannot avoid? Because we have to have S at 1, U at 2, Y at 5? So the word must be of the form S U ? ? Y.\n\nSo we have to choose the two middle letters? And we have limited options? \n\nPossible words with the available letters (without duplicates? and without excluded letters? and without using S,U,Y again? if we assume no duplicates?):\n\n- S U L K Y -> SULKY\n- S U L L Y -> SULLY (but duplicate L? so if we allow duplicates? but we don\'t know? but it\'s a valid word? and we haven\'t tested L? so we can try? but we have to choose one? \n- S U P P Y? Not a word? \n- S U W W Y? Not a word?\n- S U G G Y? Not a word? \n- S U D D Y? Not a word? \n- S U F F Y? F is available? and ""SUFFY"" is not a word? \n- S U L P H? H excluded? invalid? \n- S U B B Y? B excluded? invalid? \n- S U M M Y? M excluded? invalid? \n- S U R R Y? R excluded? invalid? \n- S U V V Y? Not a word? \n- S U Z Z Y? Z is available? and ""SUZZY"" is not a word? \n- S U K K Y? Not a word? \n- S U L F Y? F is available? but ""SULFY"" is not a word? \n- S U L P Y? P is available? ""SULPY"" is not a word? \n- S U L K Y and S U L L Y are the only common ones? \n\nSo we have two candidates: SULKY and SULLY.\n\nHow to decide? We can try one? \n\nBut note: we have feedback that might help? We don\'t have any information about L or K? So we have to guess? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t use L? But then what? For example, ""SUQ"" words? Not many? \n\nWe can try ""SULKY"" because it uses two distinct new letters? So we get more information? But if it\'s wrong, we can try SULLY? \n\nBut we have two guesses left? We are about to make the fourth guess? Then we have two more? So we can try SULKY? \n\nBut if we are lucky, it might be correct? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: is there a word that uses two different letters? Like S U D G Y? But ""sudgy"" is not a word? \n\nOr S U P P Y? Not a word? \n\nSo we have to choose between SULKY and SULLY? \n\nBut note: in SULLY, we are using L twice? So if the word has L, then we might get feedback? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut we can also consider: we have not tested the letter L? So if we guess SULKY, and if the word is SULLY, then we would get:\n  - S: ✓ (position 1)\n  - U: ✓ (position 2)\n  - L: but in SULKY we have L at position 3? and in SULLY, L is at position 3 and 4? So for the guess SULKY:\n      Position 3: L -> in SULLY, position 3 is L? so that would be ✓? \n      Position 4: K -> in SULLY, position 4 is L? so K is not in the word? so K(x)\n      Position 5: Y: ✓\n  So feedback: S(✓) U(✓) L(✓) K(x) Y(✓) -> so we would know that the word is S U L ? Y? and the fourth letter is not K? and we know it must be L? because we have only two options? So we can then guess SULLY? \n\nSimilarly, if we guess SULLY and the word is SULKY, then:\n  - S(✓), U(✓), L at position 3: in SULKY, position 3 is L? so if the word is SULKY, then position 3 is L? so L(✓) for position 3? \n  - Then position 4: L? in SULKY, position 4 is K? so L is not at position 4? but we have two L\'s? So the feedback might mark the first L as ✓ and the second L as x? Because the word has only one L? Or if the word has one L? But SULKY has one L? So in SULLY, we have two L\'s? So for the guess SULLY against SULKY:\n      Position 1: S(✓)\n      Position 2: U(✓)\n      Position 3: L(✓) because SULKY has L at position 3? \n      Position 4: L -> but SULKY does not have a second L? so L is absent? so L(x)\n      Position 5: Y(✓)\n  So feedback: S(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(x) Y(✓) -> so we know the word has only one L? and it is at position 3? and position 4 is not L? and we know it must be K? because we have only two options? So we can then guess SULKY? \n\nSo in either case, we can get the word in the next guess? \n\nBut we are making the fourth guess? So we have two more? So we can choose either? \n\nBut to be efficient? We can choose one arbitrarily? \n\nLet me choose ""SULKY"" as the fourth guess? \n\nSo guess: SULKY\n\nIf it\'s correct, we win? If not, we get feedback and then we can guess SULLY? \n\nBut note: there might be other words? For example, ""SUDGY"" is not a word? Or ""SUGNY""? Not a word? \n\nAnother possibility: ""SUCKY"" but C excluded? invalid? \n\nOr ""SUMPY""? Not a word? \n\nSo I think SULKY and SULLY are the only two common words? \n\nTherefore, we guess ""SULKY"". \n\nBut wait, we have the letter G? We haven\'t tested G? But we don\'t have a word ""SUG_Y""? \n\nSimilarly, P? ""SUP_Y""? Not a word? \n\nSo we are safe? \n\nSo let\'s go with ""SULKY"". \n\nBut note: we have to output the guess? \n\nSo: <guess>sulky</guess>\n\nBut let me double-check the feedback we have? \n\nWe are confident that the word is S U ? ? Y? and the only two options are SULKY and SULLY? \n\nYes? \n\nSo we try SULKY? \n\nBut if the word is SULLY, we will know? \n\nSo we make the guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → excluded.\n- **Guess 2 (moist)**: M, O, I, T are absent → excluded.

We have feedback for four guesses:

1. ""crane"": All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → excluded.
2. ""moist"": M, O, I, T absent → excluded. S present but not in position 4 (S(-)).
3. ""bushy"": 
   - B, H absent → excluded.
   - U correct at position 2 (U(✓)).
   - S present but not at position 3 (S(-)).
   - Y correct at position 5 (Y(✓)).
4. ""sulky"": 
   - S, U, L, Y correct (✓) at positions 1, 2, 3, 5 respectively.
   - K absent (K(x)).

Deductions from Guess 4:
- Word is S U L _ Y (since S✓ at 1, U✓ at 2, L✓ at 3, Y✓ at 5).
- K is absent → excluded.

From previous exclusions, excluded letters now are: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B,H,K.

The only missing letter is at position 4.

Available letters: all letters except excluded (C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B,H,K) and except the fixed ones (S,U,L,Y) if we assume no duplicates. But note: duplicates are possible? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far. The secret word is ""S U L ? Y"" with ? being one letter.

Available letters: D,F,G,P,Q,V,W,X,Z. (and J, but can we use?)

We need a 5-letter word: S U L ? Y, so the word must be S U L * Y, where * is a letter not in the excluded set.

Possible words: 
- SULLY: with L repeated? But we already have L at position 3? So S U L L Y → if we try ""SULLY"", then the fourth letter is L? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, ""SULLY"" is a valid word.

But we have to check: from feedback of ""sulky"", we got K(x) → so K is not in the word? And L is used? So in ""SULLY"", we have two L's? So if the word is ""SULLY"", then we should get L at position 3 (✓) and L would also be at position 4? So how would the feedback look? It would mark:

  Position 1: S(✓)
  Position 2: U(✓)
  Position 3: L(✓)
  Position 4: L? in the word? But the word has only one L? Actually, the word has two L's. So if the secret word is SULLY and we guessed SULKY, then the position 4 would be L? But since we guessed K at position 4? And the secret is L? So we would get K(x)? But for the L's: the secret has two L's? So in our guess SULKY, we have only one L? So the feedback would mark one L as ✓ (at position 3) and then we have no other L? So position 4 is K? not in the word? So K(x)? and we got K(x)? So that's consistent? But we don't know the letter at position 4.

But now we are to guess the next word? And we know that position 4 is not K? And we have limited letters? And from the above, we know that the word must be S U L * Y, with * being one letter from D,F,G,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

But what words are in the dictionary? 

- SULLY: but that has two L's? And we already have L? So for position 4, we put L? But L is already used? Which is allowed? So ""SULLY"" is a candidate? And uses L again? So letter * is L? But L is not in the available list? Because we assumed no duplicates? But we can use L? Because duplicates are allowed? So we must consider L as an option? Because the secret word might have two L's? And we haven't tested that? 

In fact, we have seen one L? But we don't know if there is a duplicate? So we must consider words that might have duplicate L? Or other letters? But the only common word ""SULLY"" fits.

Other words? 
- SULPHY? Not a word? 
- SULFY? Not a word? 
- SULPY? Not a word? 
- SULDY? Not a word? 
- SULGY? Not a word? 
- SULVY? Not a word? 
- SULWY? Not a word? 

So likely the only common word left is ""SULLY"". 

Alternatively, we might have ""SULIX"" but I excluded? invalid? 

So we guess ""SULLY"". 

But note: the letter * must be L? Because we are making the word SULLY? 

Also, we have not excluded L? So it's possible? 

In this guess, if we are wrong, we have one more try? But we are on the fifth guess? 

But we think ""SULLY"" is the answer? 

So we'll guess ""SULLY"". 

But let me write the guess: <guess>sully</guess> 

However, we need to think step by step? 

Alternatively, we can reason: in the secret word, at position 4, it must be a letter? And we know K is excluded? And the available letters? D,F,G,P,Q,V,W,X,Z? But none of these form a valid word with S U L and Y? 

For example:
  SULDY? no.
  SULGY? no.
  SULPY? no.

So only possibility is ""SULLY"" with L repeated? 

Therefore, we guess ""SULLY"".

### Analysis of Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent → excluded.
2. **Guess 2 (moist)**:
   - M, O, I, T absent → excluded.
   - S present but not in position 4 (S(-)).
3. **Guess 3 (bushy)**:
   - B, H absent → excluded.
   - U is in position 2 (U(✓)).
   - S present but not in position 3 (S(-)).
   - Y is in position 5 (Y(✓)).
4. **Guess 4 (sulky)**:
   - S, U, L, Y all correct (✓) at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 respectively.
   - K absent → excluded.

### Deductions:
- **Secret word structure**:  
  \\( \text{S} \quad \text{U} \quad \text{L} \quad \_ \quad \text{Y} \\)
  - Positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 are confirmed: **S**, **U**, **L**, **Y**.
- **Position 4** must be filled with one letter.
- **Excluded letters** (never in the word):  
  C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B, H, K.
- **Possible letters for position 4**:  
  Remaining letters: D, F, G, P, V, W, X, Z (and Q, J, but low frequency).
- **Valid word check**:  
  The only common English word fitting ""S U L _ Y"" is **SULLY** (meaning to tarnish), repeating **L** at position 4.  
  - Alternatives (e.g., SULPHY, SULFY) are invalid/uncommon.  
  - Repeating **L** is possible since feedback never forbade duplicates (position 3 L was confirmed, but position 4 remained untested).

### Reasoning:
- **SULLY** uses the confirmed letters (S, U, L, Y) by placing **L** at position 4.
- All excluded letters are avoided, and feedback rules are satisfied.
- This guess resolves the uncertainty:  
  - If correct, feedback will show all ✓.  
  - If incorrect, no valid alternatives remain given prior constraints.

<guess>sully</guess>",sully,"We have feedback for four guesses:

1. ""crane"": All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent → excluded.
2. ""moist"": M, O, I, T absent → excluded. S present but not in position 4 (S(-)).
3. ""bushy"": 
   - B, H absent → excluded.
   - U correct at position 2 (U(✓)).
   - S present but not at position 3 (S(-)).
   - Y correct at position 5 (Y(✓)).
4. ""sulky"": 
   - S, U, L, Y correct (✓) at positions 1, 2, 3, 5 respectively.
   - K absent (K(x)).

Deductions from Guess 4:
- Word is S U L _ Y (since S✓ at 1, U✓ at 2, L✓ at 3, Y✓ at 5).
- K is absent → excluded.

From previous exclusions, excluded letters now are: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B,H,K.

The only missing letter is at position 4.

Available letters: all letters except excluded (C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,T,B,H,K) and except the fixed ones (S,U,L,Y) if we assume no duplicates. But note: duplicates are possible? However, we have no indication of duplicates so far. The secret word is ""S U L ? Y"" with ? being one letter.

Available letters: D,F,G,P,Q,V,W,X,Z. (and J, but can we use?)

We need a 5-letter word: S U L ? Y, so the word must be S U L * Y, where * is a letter not in the excluded set.

Possible words: 
- SULLY: with L repeated? But we already have L at position 3? So S U L L Y → if we try ""SULLY"", then the fourth letter is L? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, ""SULLY"" is a valid word.

But we have to check: from feedback of ""sulky"", we got K(x) → so K is not in the word? And L is used? So in ""SULLY"", we have two L's? So if the word is ""SULLY"", then we should get L at position 3 (✓) and L would also be at position 4? So how would the feedback look? It would mark:

  Position 1: S(✓)
  Position 2: U(✓)
  Position 3: L(✓)
  Position 4: L? in the word? But the word has only one L? Actually, the word has two L's. So if the secret word is SULLY and we guessed SULKY, then the position 4 would be L? But since we guessed K at position 4? And the secret is L? So we would get K(x)? But for the L's: the secret has two L's? So in our guess SULKY, we have only one L? So the feedback would mark one L as ✓ (at position 3) and then we have no other L? So position 4 is K? not in the word? So K(x)? and we got K(x)? So that's consistent? But we don't know the letter at position 4.

But now we are to guess the next word? And we know that position 4 is not K? And we have limited letters? And from the above, we know that the word must be S U L * Y, with * being one letter from D,F,G,P,Q,V,W,X,Z.

But what words are in the dictionary? 

- SULLY: but that has two L's? And we already have L? So for position 4, we put L? But L is already used? Which is allowed? So ""SULLY"" is a candidate? And uses L again? So letter * is L? But L is not in the available list? Because we assumed no duplicates? But we can use L? Because duplicates are allowed? So we must consider L as an option? Because the secret word might have two L's? And we haven't tested that? 

In fact, we have seen one L? But we don't know if there is a duplicate? So we must consider words that might have duplicate L? Or other letters? But the only common word ""SULLY"" fits.

Other words? 
- SULPHY? Not a word? 
- SULFY? Not a word? 
- SULPY? Not a word? 
- SULDY? Not a word? 
- SULGY? Not a word? 
- SULVY? Not a word? 
- SULWY? Not a word? 

So likely the only common word left is ""SULLY"". 

Alternatively, we might have ""SULIX"" but I excluded? invalid? 

So we guess ""SULLY"". 

But note: the letter * must be L? Because we are making the word SULLY? 

Also, we have not excluded L? So it's possible? 

In this guess, if we are wrong, we have one more try? But we are on the fifth guess? 

But we think ""SULLY"" is the answer? 

So we'll guess ""SULLY"". 

But let me write the guess: <guess>sully</guess> 

However, we need to think step by step? 

Alternatively, we can reason: in the secret word, at position 4, it must be a letter? And we know K is excluded? And the available letters? D,F,G,P,Q,V,W,X,Z? But none of these form a valid word with S U L and Y? 

For example:
  SULDY? no.
  SULGY? no.
  SULPY? no.

So only possibility is ""SULLY"" with L repeated? 

Therefore, we guess ""SULLY"".### Analysis of Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) absent → excluded.
2. **Guess 2 (moist)**:
   - M, O, I, T absent → excluded.
   - S present but not in position 4 (S(-)).
3. **Guess 3 (bushy)**:
   - B, H absent → excluded.
   - U is in position 2 (U(✓)).
   - S present but not in position 3 (S(-)).
   - Y is in position 5 (Y(✓)).
4. **Guess 4 (sulky)**:
   - S, U, L, Y all correct (✓) at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 respectively.
   - K absent → excluded.

### Deductions:
- **Secret word structure**:  
  \\( \text{S} \quad \text{U} \quad \text{L} \quad \_ \quad \text{Y} \\)
  - Positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 are confirmed: **S**, **U**, **L**, **Y**.
- **Position 4** must be filled with one letter.
- **Excluded letters** (never in the word):  
  C, R, A, N, E, M, O, I, T, B, H, K.
- **Possible letters for position 4**:  
  Remaining letters: D, F, G, P, V, W, X, Z (and Q, J, but low frequency).
- **Valid word check**:  
  The only common English word fitting ""S U L _ Y"" is **SULLY** (meaning to tarnish), repeating **L** at position 4.  
  - Alternatives (e.g., SULPHY, SULFY) are invalid/uncommon.  
  - Repeating **L** is possible since feedback never forbade duplicates (position 3 L was confirmed, but position 4 remained untested).

### Reasoning:
- **SULLY** uses the confirmed letters (S, U, L, Y) by placing **L** at position 4.
- All excluded letters are avoided, and feedback rules are satisfied.
- This guess resolves the uncertainty:  
  - If correct, feedback will show all ✓.  
  - If incorrect, no valid alternatives remain given prior constraints.",Guess 5: sully -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) U(✓) L(✓) L(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
