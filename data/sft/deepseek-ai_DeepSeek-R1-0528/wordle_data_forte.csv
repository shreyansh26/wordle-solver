We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter)

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
- The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and it's marked as wrong position).
- The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (since E is in the correct position at the end).
- Contains the letter R (but not in position 2).
- Does not contain C, A, or N.

Also, we should avoid using the same letters again unless we have to (but we know C, A, N are out).

We have 6 tries, so we are on the second guess.

We can use this feedback to narrow down possibilities.

Let me think of words that end with E and contain R (but R not at position 2).

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since position 2 is excluded and position 5 is E, so R can't be at 5).

We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have to avoid C, A, N.

Common letters: We can try to include other common vowels and consonants to get more information.

The word must have R and E (with E at the end). Also, we know the first letter is not C (since C is not in the word) and not A (A is not in the word).

Let me think of words ending in E that contain R and without C, A, N.

Some possibilities:
- R at position 1: words like ""RUBLE"", ""RIPER"", ""RIDGE"", ""RIFLE"", ""RINSE"" (but N is not allowed, so skip ""RINSE""), ""RIPER"" (but R is at position 1 and 5? but position 5 is E, so not R) -> ""RIPER"" ends with R, not E.

We need words ending with E.

Examples:
- ""RIDGE"": R (1), I (2), D (3), G (4), E (5) -> but we have to check if these letters are allowed. We don't know about I, D, G yet. Also, R is at position 1, which is allowed (since it can't be at 2).
- ""RIFLE"": R (1), I (2), F (3), L (4), E (5) -> R at 1, and I at 2.
- ""RUBLE"": R (1), U (2), B (3), L (4), E (5) -> R at 1.

But note: in the feedback, we have E at the end, so the word must be ? ? ? ? E.

We also know that R is in the word but not at position 2. So in the new word, we can put R at 1, 3, or 4.

However, we must avoid using C, A, N.

Let me try to think of words that have R and end with E, without C, A, N.

Another idea: since we have E at the end, and R somewhere else, we can try to use other common letters to get more feedback.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E. We know C, A, N are absent, and R and E are present (with E fixed at the end).

So available letters: we can use other vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

But we must include R (because it's in the word) and we know E is at the end.

So a good strategy is to put R in a different position (not 2) and include other common letters.

Let me try to form a word:

Option 1: Put R at position 1: e.g., ""R"" ? ? ? E

The second letter can be a vowel we haven't tried: like I, O, U.

But we have to avoid A (which we know is not in the word).

So, for example: ""RIPLE""? Not a word. ""RIDGE"" as above.

""RIDGE"" is a word: R-I-D-G-E.

But we don't know about I, D, G.

Another option: ""RIFLE"" (R-I-F-L-E).

Or ""RUBLE"" (R-U-B-L-E).

We could put R at position 3: for example, ? ? R ? E

The first two letters can be new letters.

For example: ""PURSE"" (P-U-R-S-E) -> but we have S and U, and E at the end. However, we don't know about U, P, S.

But note: we have to avoid C, A, N.

""PURSE"" doesn't have C, A, N.

Similarly, ""BURKE"" (but not common, and K is a letter).

Or ""CURSE"" but C is not allowed (we know C is absent).

So ""PURSE"" is acceptable.

We could put R at position 4: ? ? ? R E

For example: ""STORE"" (S-T-O-R-E) -> but we have O and T, and S.

But we don't know about S, T, O.

However, we already used S? No, in the first guess we used C, R, A, N, E. So S is new.

But note: in the first guess, we had R and E, and now we are using R again? That's okay because we know R is in the word, but we don't know its position. We can reuse R to try to find its position.

But we already know R is not at position 2, so we can try it at other positions.

Now, which word to choose?

We want to maximize information. So we should try to include letters that are common and that we haven't tried yet.

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know C, A, N are out).

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc. Common vowels: O, I, U.

So a word that includes several of these.

Option 1: ""RIDGE"" -> letters: R, I, D, G, E. We know R and E are in the word, so we are testing I, D, G.

Option 2: ""RIFLE"" -> R, I, F, L, E. Testing I, F, L.

Option 3: ""PURSE"" -> P, U, R, S, E. Testing P, U, S.

Option 4: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E. Testing S, T, O.

""STORE"" seems good because it has three new common letters: S, T, O.

But note: we have to avoid putting R at position 2? In ""STORE"", R is at position 4, which is allowed (since we know R is not at position 2, but it can be at 4).

Also, E is at the end.

So ""STORE"" is a valid guess.

But let me check if it meets the criteria: 
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains R: at position 4.
- No C, A, N: yes.

We can also consider ""ROUSE"" (R-O-U-S-E) -> R at position 1, but we know R is not at position 2? Actually, we don't know about position 1. In ""ROUSE"", R is at 1, which is allowed. But then we are testing O, U, S.

But ""STORE"" tests S, T, O, which are very common.

Another word: ""PRIDE"" (P-R-I-D-E) -> but R is at position 2? Wait, position 2 is R. But we have feedback that R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again.

Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2.

In ""STORE"", R is at position 4, which is fine.

In ""PRIDE"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong, so we shouldn't do that.

Similarly, in ""RIDGE"", R is at position 1, which is okay.

But ""STORE"" has the advantage of having three entirely new letters (S, T, O) and R at a new position (4) and E fixed.

So I think ""STORE"" is a good choice.

We could also consider ""SPIRE"" (S-P-I-R-E) -> R at position 4, and we test S, P, I. But I is a vowel, and we haven't tested O or U.

But ""STORE"" is more common.

Another common word: ""SHIRE"" (S-H-I-R-E) -> but H and I.

I think ""STORE"" is fine.

Let me confirm: the word ""STORE"" is valid.

So I will guess ""STORE"".

But note: we are on the second guess, and we have to make sure we don't repeat the mistake of putting R at position 2.

In ""STORE"": 
- S at position 1
- T at position 2
- O at position 3
- R at position 4
- E at position 5

So R is at 4, which is not 2, so that's allowed.

We are testing S, T, O, and also confirming R and E.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So I'll go with ""STORE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in the second position.
- E is in the word and correctly placed at the fifth position.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- It must include R, but not in position 2.
- It cannot contain C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) and avoid reusing incorrect positions for R.

A suitable guess is ""STORE"":
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Places R at position 4 (not position 2).
- Includes new letters S, T, and O (common and untested).
- Avoids C, A, N.

We can use this feedback to narrow down possibilities.

Let me think of words that end with E and contain R (but R not at position 2).

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (since position 2 is excluded and position 5 is E, so R can't be at 5).

We also know that the word has 5 letters and we have to avoid C, A, N.

Common letters: We can try to include other common vowels and consonants to get more information.

The word must have R and E (with E at the end). Also, we know the first letter is not C (since C is not in the word) and not A (A is not in the word).

Let me think of words ending in E that contain R and without C, A, N.

Some possibilities:
- R at position 1: words like ""RUBLE"", ""RIPER"", ""RIDGE"", ""RIFLE"", ""RINSE"" (but N is not allowed, so skip ""RINSE""), ""RIPER"" (but R is at position 1 and 5? but position 5 is E, so not R) -> ""RIPER"" ends with R, not E.

We need words ending with E.

Examples:
- ""RIDGE"": R (1), I (2), D (3), G (4), E (5) -> but we have to check if these letters are allowed. We don't know about I, D, G yet. Also, R is at position 1, which is allowed (since it can't be at 2).
- ""RIFLE"": R (1), I (2), F (3), L (4), E (5) -> R at 1, and I at 2.
- ""RUBLE"": R (1), U (2), B (3), L (4), E (5) -> R at 1.

But note: in the feedback, we have E at the end, so the word must be ? ? ? ? E.

We also know that R is in the word but not at position 2. So in the new word, we can put R at 1, 3, or 4.

However, we must avoid using C, A, N.

Let me try to think of words that have R and end with E, without C, A, N.

Another idea: since we have E at the end, and R somewhere else, we can try to use other common letters to get more feedback.

We have already used: C, R, A, N, E. We know C, A, N are absent, and R and E are present (with E fixed at the end).

So available letters: we can use other vowels (I, O, U) and consonants (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

We want to test as many new letters as possible.

But we must include R (because it's in the word) and we know E is at the end.

So a good strategy is to put R in a different position (not 2) and include other common letters.

Let me try to form a word:

Option 1: Put R at position 1: e.g., ""R"" ? ? ? E

The second letter can be a vowel we haven't tried: like I, O, U.

But we have to avoid A (which we know is not in the word).

So, for example: ""RIPLE""? Not a word. ""RIDGE"" as above.

""RIDGE"" is a word: R-I-D-G-E.

But we don't know about I, D, G.

Another option: ""RIFLE"" (R-I-F-L-E).

Or ""RUBLE"" (R-U-B-L-E).

We could put R at position 3: for example, ? ? R ? E

The first two letters can be new letters.

For example: ""PURSE"" (P-U-R-S-E) -> but we have S and U, and E at the end. However, we don't know about U, P, S.

But note: we have to avoid C, A, N.

""PURSE"" doesn't have C, A, N.

Similarly, ""BURKE"" (but not common, and K is a letter).

Or ""CURSE"" but C is not allowed (we know C is absent).

So ""PURSE"" is acceptable.

We could put R at position 4: ? ? ? R E

For example: ""STORE"" (S-T-O-R-E) -> but we have O and T, and S.

But we don't know about S, T, O.

However, we already used S? No, in the first guess we used C, R, A, N, E. So S is new.

But note: in the first guess, we had R and E, and now we are using R again? That's okay because we know R is in the word, but we don't know its position. We can reuse R to try to find its position.

But we already know R is not at position 2, so we can try it at other positions.

Now, which word to choose?

We want to maximize information. So we should try to include letters that are common and that we haven't tried yet.

We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know C, A, N are out).

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, etc. Common vowels: O, I, U.

So a word that includes several of these.

Option 1: ""RIDGE"" -> letters: R, I, D, G, E. We know R and E are in the word, so we are testing I, D, G.

Option 2: ""RIFLE"" -> R, I, F, L, E. Testing I, F, L.

Option 3: ""PURSE"" -> P, U, R, S, E. Testing P, U, S.

Option 4: ""STORE"" -> S, T, O, R, E. Testing S, T, O.

""STORE"" seems good because it has three new common letters: S, T, O.

But note: we have to avoid putting R at position 2? In ""STORE"", R is at position 4, which is allowed (since we know R is not at position 2, but it can be at 4).

Also, E is at the end.

So ""STORE"" is a valid guess.

But let me check if it meets the criteria: 
- Ends with E: yes.
- Contains R: at position 4.
- No C, A, N: yes.

We can also consider ""ROUSE"" (R-O-U-S-E) -> R at position 1, but we know R is not at position 2? Actually, we don't know about position 1. In ""ROUSE"", R is at 1, which is allowed. But then we are testing O, U, S.

But ""STORE"" tests S, T, O, which are very common.

Another word: ""PRIDE"" (P-R-I-D-E) -> but R is at position 2? Wait, position 2 is R. But we have feedback that R is in the word but not at position 2. So we cannot put R at position 2 again.

Therefore, we must avoid putting R at position 2.

In ""STORE"", R is at position 4, which is fine.

In ""PRIDE"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong, so we shouldn't do that.

Similarly, in ""RIDGE"", R is at position 1, which is okay.

But ""STORE"" has the advantage of having three entirely new letters (S, T, O) and R at a new position (4) and E fixed.

So I think ""STORE"" is a good choice.

We could also consider ""SPIRE"" (S-P-I-R-E) -> R at position 4, and we test S, P, I. But I is a vowel, and we haven't tested O or U.

But ""STORE"" is more common.

Another common word: ""SHIRE"" (S-H-I-R-E) -> but H and I.

I think ""STORE"" is fine.

Let me confirm: the word ""STORE"" is valid.

So I will guess ""STORE"".

But note: we are on the second guess, and we have to make sure we don't repeat the mistake of putting R at position 2.

In ""STORE"": 
- S at position 1
- T at position 2
- O at position 3
- R at position 4
- E at position 5

So R is at 4, which is not 2, so that's allowed.

We are testing S, T, O, and also confirming R and E.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So I'll go with ""STORE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word.
- R is in the word but not in the second position.
- E is in the word and correctly placed at the fifth position.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- It must include R, but not in position 2.
- It cannot contain C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, I should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, O) and avoid reusing incorrect positions for R.

A suitable guess is ""STORE"":
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Places R at position 4 (not position 2).
- Includes new letters S, T, and O (common and untested).
- Avoids C, A, N.

We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present but wrong position (-)
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: correct (✓) at position 5

Second guess: ""store""
- S: absent (x)
- T: present but wrong position (-)
- O: present but wrong position (-)
- R: present but wrong position (-)
- E: correct (✓) at position 5

What we know so far:
1. The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The letters C, A, N, and S are absent.
3. The letters R, T, and O are present in the word, but not in the positions we guessed:
   - R is not at position 2 (from ""crane"") and not at position 4 (from ""store"").
   - T is not at position 2 (from ""store"").
   - O is not at position 3 (from ""store"").

Also, since R, T, and O are present, and we know their incorrect positions, we can deduce possible positions.

Let's list the positions:
Position 1: unknown
Position 2: cannot be R (from ""crane"") and cannot be T (from ""store"")
Position 3: cannot be O (from ""store"")
Position 4: cannot be R (from ""store"")
Position 5: E (fixed)

So for position 2, we know it cannot be R or T. Also, it cannot be C, A, N, S (absent letters). So we must choose a letter that is not C, A, N, S, R, T.

Similarly, for the other positions, we have constraints.

We also know the word contains R, T, O, and E (with E at the end). Since it's a 5-letter word, there is one more letter to find.

The absent letters so far: C, A, N, S.

Present letters: R, T, O, E (E is fixed at 5).

So the secret word has: [letter1], [letter2], [letter3], [letter4], E.

And it must contain R, T, O in positions 1,2,3,4 but not in the forbidden positions.

Possible positions for R:
- Cannot be at 2 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at 4 (from ""store""). So R can only be at position 1 or 3.

Possible positions for T:
- Cannot be at 2 (from ""store""). So T can be at 1, 3, or 4.

But note: if R is at 1, then T cannot be at 1. Similarly, if R is at 3, then T cannot be at 3. Also, T cannot be at 2.

Possible positions for O:
- Cannot be at 3 (from ""store""). So O can be at 1, 2, or 4.

Now, we need to consider the constraints together.

Also, we have to find one more letter. Since we have 5 letters and we know 4 (R, T, O, E), the fifth letter must be one we haven't tried yet, and not absent.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O. So absent: C, A, N, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that has R, T, O, E and one more letter from the available set.

Now, let's think of possible words.

First, consider the position of R: either 1 or 3.

Case 1: R at position 1.
Then the word is: R _ _ _ E
Position 2: cannot be T (from ""store"") and cannot be R (already at 1) and not absent letters. Also, O cannot be at 3? O can be at 2 or 4.

If R is at 1, then:
- Position 2: must be a letter that is not C, A, N, S, R, T. And it could be O? But O is present, so it can be at 2? But we don't know if O is at 2 or not. O can be at 2,4.

But position 2 cannot be T, so if O is at 2, that's possible.

Similarly, T must be at 3 or 4 (since not at 2).

But position 4 cannot be R (but R is at 1, so that's fine), but we have the constraint that R is not at 4, which is satisfied.

Also, O cannot be at 3, so if R is at 1, O can be at 2 or 4.

T can be at 3 or 4.

But if O is at 2, then T can be at 3 or 4.

If O is at 4, then T can be at 3.

Also, the remaining position must be filled with a new letter.

For example:
- If R at 1, O at 2, then word: R O _ _ E
  Then T must be at 3 or 4, and the other position is a new letter.
  But O at 2: is that allowed? We don't have any constraint that position 2 cannot be O. Only that it cannot be R or T. So O at 2 is possible.

But we have to check if such words exist.

Similarly, if R at 1, and O at 4, then word: R _ _ O E
Then T must be at 3 (since not at 2, and position 1 is R, so T at 3). Then position 2 is the new letter.

Case 2: R at position 3.
Then word: _ _ R _ E
Position 2: cannot be R or T, and not absent. Also, O cannot be at 3 (but R is at 3, so O is not at 3, which is good). O can be at 1,2,4.
T cannot be at 2, so T can be at 1 or 4.

If R at 3, then:
- Position 1: can be O? or T? or a new letter.
- Position 2: must be a letter not absent and not R, not T. So it could be O? or a new letter? But O is present, so it could be at 2.

But O can be at 2? We have no constraint against O at 2.

Similarly, T can be at 1 or 4.

Now, let's list possible words based on common letters.

We also need to test new letters to identify the fifth letter.

But we know the word has exactly five letters: R, T, O, E, and one more.

So the fifth letter is unknown.

We should choose a word that includes one of the available letters and places R, T, O in allowed positions.

Since we have constraints on positions, we can try to fix the positions.

But we don't know which case, so we might need to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

But we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Let me think of words ending with E that contain R, T, O.

And avoid C, A, N, S.

For example:
- ""TROVE"" -> T, R, O, V, E. But T is at position 1? In ""TROVE"": T(1), R(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). 
  But we have constraints: R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") and in ""TROVE"" R is at 2, which is forbidden. So invalid.

- ""ROUTE"" -> R(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). 
  Check positions: 
    R at 1: allowed (since not 2 or 4? not 2 is required, and 1 is okay). 
    O at 2: is that allowed? Position 2 cannot be R or T, but it can be O? Yes, because we have no constraint that position 2 cannot be O. 
    T at 4: but from ""store"", we have that R cannot be at 4, but T at 4 is allowed? The constraint for position 4 from ""store"" was only for R (since we had R at 4 and it was wrong). For T, we only know it cannot be at 2, but 4 is okay.
  Also, O at 2: but from ""store"", we know O is not at 3, but 2 is okay.
  So ""ROUTE"" seems possible. 
  Letters: R, O, U, T, E. We haven't tested U, so it could be present or not? But in this word, U is included.

But we don't know if U is in the word or not. We are testing it.

Similarly, we avoid C, A, N, S.

So ""ROUTE"" is a valid guess.

Another word: ""TIGER"" -> T(1), I(2), G(3), E(4), R(5). But position 5 is E, so R cannot be at 5. And we have E at 5, so the word must end with E, not R. So invalid.

""TOWER"" -> T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5). But position 5 is R, not E. We need E at 5. So invalid.

""ROGUE"" -> R(1), O(2), G(3), U(4), E(5). 
- R at 1: allowed.
- O at 2: allowed (position 2 not forbidden for O).
- G and U are new.
- But O is at 3? In ""ROGUE"", O is at position 2, not 3. And we know O cannot be at 3, which is satisfied because it's at 2.
- Also, R at 1, not 2 or 4, good.
- T is present? But ""ROGUE"" does not have T. But we know T is in the word (from ""store"" feedback: T is present). So ""ROGUE"" lacks T, so it cannot be the word because T must be in it.

We must include T.

So ""ROUTE"" has T at position 4.

Another possibility: ""TODIE"" not a word.

""OTTER"" -> O(1), T(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). But ends with R, not E. Invalid.

""OTHER"" -> O(1), T(2), H(3), E(4), R(5). Again, ends with R.

We need words ending with E.

""ROTATE"" is 6 letters, too long.

""ROTATE"" is 6, so no.

""WRITE"" -> W(1), R(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). But R is at position 2, which is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback: R not at 2). So invalid.

""TRICE"" -> T(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), E(5). But C is absent (from first guess), so cannot have C. Also, R at 2 is forbidden.

""BRUTE"" -> B(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But R at 2 is forbidden.

""GRATE"" -> G(1), R(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But A is absent and R at 2 forbidden.

So back to ""ROUTE"": R(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). This seems to satisfy all constraints.

Another word: ""TRODE"" -> T(1), R(2), O(3), D(4), E(5). But R at 2 is forbidden.

""FORCE"" -> F(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), E(5). But C is absent, and also R at 3? But we have R at 3, which is allowed (since R can be at 1 or 3). But C is absent, so invalid.

""GORGE"" -> G(1), O(2), R(3), G(4), E(5). But no T? We need T in the word. ""GORGE"" has G, O, R, G, E — no T, but T must be present. So invalid.

""PORTE"" -> P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), E(5). 
- P at 1: new letter.
- O at 2: allowed.
- R at 3: allowed (R can be at 3).
- T at 4: allowed (T not forbidden at 4).
- E at 5: fixed.
- Also, no C, A, N, S.

But in ""PORTE"", we have R at 3 and T at 4.

Check constraints:
- R at 3: from ""crane"", R not at 2, which is satisfied; from ""store"", R not at 4, which is satisfied because it's at 3.
- T at 4: from ""store"", T not at 2, which is satisfied.
- O at 2: from ""store"", O not at 3, which is satisfied because it's at 2.

So ""PORTE"" is also a possibility.

But ""PORTE"" is a word? It might be less common, but it is a word (as in ""porte cochere"" or French for door, but accepted in Wordle?).

Similarly, ""ROUTE"" is common.

We have two options: ""ROUTE"" and ""PORTE"".

But we need to choose one.

We can also consider ""MORAE"" but that has A, which is absent.

""BROKE"" -> B(1), R(2), O(3), K(4), E(5). But R at 2 forbidden.

""TROPE"" -> T(1), R(2), O(3), P(4), E(5). R at 2 forbidden.

""GROVE"" -> G(1), R(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). R at 2 forbidden.

So positions matter.

Another word: ""HORDE"" -> H(1), O(2), R(3), D(4), E(5). 
- R at 3: allowed.
- O at 2: allowed.
- But no T? We need T in the word. ""HORDE"" has H, O, R, D, E — no T, but T is present. So invalid.

Similarly, ""FORTE"" -> F(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), E(5). 
- F at 1: new.
- O at 2: allowed.
- R at 3: allowed (since not 2 or 4).
- T at 4: allowed (not forbidden).
- E at 5: fixed.

And no C, A, N, S.

""FORTE"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""ROUTE"" has U, which is less common? But both are valid.

We can choose either.

But let's see which one tests a new letter that might be more informative.

In ""ROUTE"", we test U.
In ""FORTE"", we test F.

Both are new.

But we have to consider that the fifth letter might be one of these.

Since we don't know, we can pick one.

Another word: ""VOICE"" but C is absent.

""POISE"" but no R or T.

We need R and T.

""PRONE"" -> P(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But R at 2 forbidden, and N is absent.

""TRITE"" -> T(1), R(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). R at 2 forbidden.

""ORATE"" -> O(1), R(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). R at 2 forbidden, and A absent.

So back to ""ROUTE"", ""FORTE"", or ""PORTE"".

I think ""FORTE"" is a good choice because it has common letters.

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

We are on the third guess.

We can also consider that in ""store"", we had O at position 3 marked as wrong position, but in ""FORTE"", O is at position 2, which is different.

Similarly, in ""ROUTE"", O is at position 2.

But we don't know if O can be at 2 or not.

We have no information about position 2 except that it cannot be R or T.

So both are possible.

I'll go with ""FORTE"" as it is a common word.

But let's see the letters: in ""FORTE"", we have F, O, R, T, E.

We know O, R, T, E are present, so we are testing F.

If F is in the word, we get feedback; if not, we know it's absent.

Similarly for ""ROUTE"", testing U.

But F is more common? Not necessarily.

We can choose based on word frequency.

But for the sake of the game, I'll pick ""FORTE"".

Another idea: we can try to put R at position 1 or 3, and in ""FORTE"", R is at 3.

In ""ROUTE"", R is at 1.

We don't know which, so either is fine.

I think ""FORTE"" is a solid choice.

So I'll guess ""FORTE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (absent), N (absent), E (correct, position 5).
- **Guess 2: ""store""** → S (absent), T (present, wrong position), O (present, wrong position), R (present, wrong position), E (correct, position 5).

### Key Insights:
- **E is confirmed** at position 5.
- **R, T, and O are present** in the word, but with position constraints:
  - R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 4 (from ""store""), so it must be at position 1 or 3.
  - T cannot be at position 2 (from ""store""), so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
  - O cannot be at position 3 (from ""store""), so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, S (cannot appear in the word).
- The word must include R, T, O, and E, plus one unknown letter (from the remaining untested letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a word that:
  - Ends with E (position 5).
  - Includes R, T, and O in allowed positions (e.g., R at 1 or 3, T not at 2, O not at 3).
  - Uses a new common letter to gather more information.
  - Avoids absent letters (C, A, N, S).
- ""FORTE"" is a strong candidate:
  - **F** (new letter, tests for presence).
  - **O** at position 2 (allowed, since position 2 cannot be R or T, but O is permitted).
  - **R** at position 3 (allowed, as R cannot be at 2 or 4).
  - **T** at position 4 (allowed, as T cannot be at 2, but 4 is valid).
  - **E** at position 5 (confirmed).
- This guess tests the position of R (at 3), T (at 4), and O (at 2), while introducing F as a new letter. It also respects all constraints from previous feedback.

<guess>forte</guess>",forte,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: present but wrong position (-)
- A: absent (x)
- N: absent (x)
- E: correct (✓) at position 5

Second guess: ""store""
- S: absent (x)
- T: present but wrong position (-)
- O: present but wrong position (-)
- R: present but wrong position (-)
- E: correct (✓) at position 5

What we know so far:
1. The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The letters C, A, N, and S are absent.
3. The letters R, T, and O are present in the word, but not in the positions we guessed:
   - R is not at position 2 (from ""crane"") and not at position 4 (from ""store"").
   - T is not at position 2 (from ""store"").
   - O is not at position 3 (from ""store"").

Also, since R, T, and O are present, and we know their incorrect positions, we can deduce possible positions.

Let's list the positions:
Position 1: unknown
Position 2: cannot be R (from ""crane"") and cannot be T (from ""store"")
Position 3: cannot be O (from ""store"")
Position 4: cannot be R (from ""store"")
Position 5: E (fixed)

So for position 2, we know it cannot be R or T. Also, it cannot be C, A, N, S (absent letters). So we must choose a letter that is not C, A, N, S, R, T.

Similarly, for the other positions, we have constraints.

We also know the word contains R, T, O, and E (with E at the end). Since it's a 5-letter word, there is one more letter to find.

The absent letters so far: C, A, N, S.

Present letters: R, T, O, E (E is fixed at 5).

So the secret word has: [letter1], [letter2], [letter3], [letter4], E.

And it must contain R, T, O in positions 1,2,3,4 but not in the forbidden positions.

Possible positions for R:
- Cannot be at 2 (from ""crane"") and cannot be at 4 (from ""store""). So R can only be at position 1 or 3.

Possible positions for T:
- Cannot be at 2 (from ""store""). So T can be at 1, 3, or 4.

But note: if R is at 1, then T cannot be at 1. Similarly, if R is at 3, then T cannot be at 3. Also, T cannot be at 2.

Possible positions for O:
- Cannot be at 3 (from ""store""). So O can be at 1, 2, or 4.

Now, we need to consider the constraints together.

Also, we have to find one more letter. Since we have 5 letters and we know 4 (R, T, O, E), the fifth letter must be one we haven't tried yet, and not absent.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O. So absent: C, A, N, S.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a word that has R, T, O, E and one more letter from the available set.

Now, let's think of possible words.

First, consider the position of R: either 1 or 3.

Case 1: R at position 1.
Then the word is: R _ _ _ E
Position 2: cannot be T (from ""store"") and cannot be R (already at 1) and not absent letters. Also, O cannot be at 3? O can be at 2 or 4.

If R is at 1, then:
- Position 2: must be a letter that is not C, A, N, S, R, T. And it could be O? But O is present, so it can be at 2? But we don't know if O is at 2 or not. O can be at 2,4.

But position 2 cannot be T, so if O is at 2, that's possible.

Similarly, T must be at 3 or 4 (since not at 2).

But position 4 cannot be R (but R is at 1, so that's fine), but we have the constraint that R is not at 4, which is satisfied.

Also, O cannot be at 3, so if R is at 1, O can be at 2 or 4.

T can be at 3 or 4.

But if O is at 2, then T can be at 3 or 4.

If O is at 4, then T can be at 3.

Also, the remaining position must be filled with a new letter.

For example:
- If R at 1, O at 2, then word: R O _ _ E
  Then T must be at 3 or 4, and the other position is a new letter.
  But O at 2: is that allowed? We don't have any constraint that position 2 cannot be O. Only that it cannot be R or T. So O at 2 is possible.

But we have to check if such words exist.

Similarly, if R at 1, and O at 4, then word: R _ _ O E
Then T must be at 3 (since not at 2, and position 1 is R, so T at 3). Then position 2 is the new letter.

Case 2: R at position 3.
Then word: _ _ R _ E
Position 2: cannot be R or T, and not absent. Also, O cannot be at 3 (but R is at 3, so O is not at 3, which is good). O can be at 1,2,4.
T cannot be at 2, so T can be at 1 or 4.

If R at 3, then:
- Position 1: can be O? or T? or a new letter.
- Position 2: must be a letter not absent and not R, not T. So it could be O? or a new letter? But O is present, so it could be at 2.

But O can be at 2? We have no constraint against O at 2.

Similarly, T can be at 1 or 4.

Now, let's list possible words based on common letters.

We also need to test new letters to identify the fifth letter.

But we know the word has exactly five letters: R, T, O, E, and one more.

So the fifth letter is unknown.

We should choose a word that includes one of the available letters and places R, T, O in allowed positions.

Since we have constraints on positions, we can try to fix the positions.

But we don't know which case, so we might need to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests multiple possibilities.

But we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Let me think of words ending with E that contain R, T, O.

And avoid C, A, N, S.

For example:
- ""TROVE"" -> T, R, O, V, E. But T is at position 1? In ""TROVE"": T(1), R(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). 
  But we have constraints: R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") and in ""TROVE"" R is at 2, which is forbidden. So invalid.

- ""ROUTE"" -> R(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). 
  Check positions: 
    R at 1: allowed (since not 2 or 4? not 2 is required, and 1 is okay). 
    O at 2: is that allowed? Position 2 cannot be R or T, but it can be O? Yes, because we have no constraint that position 2 cannot be O. 
    T at 4: but from ""store"", we have that R cannot be at 4, but T at 4 is allowed? The constraint for position 4 from ""store"" was only for R (since we had R at 4 and it was wrong). For T, we only know it cannot be at 2, but 4 is okay.
  Also, O at 2: but from ""store"", we know O is not at 3, but 2 is okay.
  So ""ROUTE"" seems possible. 
  Letters: R, O, U, T, E. We haven't tested U, so it could be present or not? But in this word, U is included.

But we don't know if U is in the word or not. We are testing it.

Similarly, we avoid C, A, N, S.

So ""ROUTE"" is a valid guess.

Another word: ""TIGER"" -> T(1), I(2), G(3), E(4), R(5). But position 5 is E, so R cannot be at 5. And we have E at 5, so the word must end with E, not R. So invalid.

""TOWER"" -> T(1), O(2), W(3), E(4), R(5). But position 5 is R, not E. We need E at 5. So invalid.

""ROGUE"" -> R(1), O(2), G(3), U(4), E(5). 
- R at 1: allowed.
- O at 2: allowed (position 2 not forbidden for O).
- G and U are new.
- But O is at 3? In ""ROGUE"", O is at position 2, not 3. And we know O cannot be at 3, which is satisfied because it's at 2.
- Also, R at 1, not 2 or 4, good.
- T is present? But ""ROGUE"" does not have T. But we know T is in the word (from ""store"" feedback: T is present). So ""ROGUE"" lacks T, so it cannot be the word because T must be in it.

We must include T.

So ""ROUTE"" has T at position 4.

Another possibility: ""TODIE"" not a word.

""OTTER"" -> O(1), T(2), T(3), E(4), R(5). But ends with R, not E. Invalid.

""OTHER"" -> O(1), T(2), H(3), E(4), R(5). Again, ends with R.

We need words ending with E.

""ROTATE"" is 6 letters, too long.

""ROTATE"" is 6, so no.

""WRITE"" -> W(1), R(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). But R is at position 2, which is forbidden (from ""crane"" feedback: R not at 2). So invalid.

""TRICE"" -> T(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), E(5). But C is absent (from first guess), so cannot have C. Also, R at 2 is forbidden.

""BRUTE"" -> B(1), R(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). But R at 2 is forbidden.

""GRATE"" -> G(1), R(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). But A is absent and R at 2 forbidden.

So back to ""ROUTE"": R(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), E(5). This seems to satisfy all constraints.

Another word: ""TRODE"" -> T(1), R(2), O(3), D(4), E(5). But R at 2 is forbidden.

""FORCE"" -> F(1), O(2), R(3), C(4), E(5). But C is absent, and also R at 3? But we have R at 3, which is allowed (since R can be at 1 or 3). But C is absent, so invalid.

""GORGE"" -> G(1), O(2), R(3), G(4), E(5). But no T? We need T in the word. ""GORGE"" has G, O, R, G, E — no T, but T must be present. So invalid.

""PORTE"" -> P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), E(5). 
- P at 1: new letter.
- O at 2: allowed.
- R at 3: allowed (R can be at 3).
- T at 4: allowed (T not forbidden at 4).
- E at 5: fixed.
- Also, no C, A, N, S.

But in ""PORTE"", we have R at 3 and T at 4.

Check constraints:
- R at 3: from ""crane"", R not at 2, which is satisfied; from ""store"", R not at 4, which is satisfied because it's at 3.
- T at 4: from ""store"", T not at 2, which is satisfied.
- O at 2: from ""store"", O not at 3, which is satisfied because it's at 2.

So ""PORTE"" is also a possibility.

But ""PORTE"" is a word? It might be less common, but it is a word (as in ""porte cochere"" or French for door, but accepted in Wordle?).

Similarly, ""ROUTE"" is common.

We have two options: ""ROUTE"" and ""PORTE"".

But we need to choose one.

We can also consider ""MORAE"" but that has A, which is absent.

""BROKE"" -> B(1), R(2), O(3), K(4), E(5). But R at 2 forbidden.

""TROPE"" -> T(1), R(2), O(3), P(4), E(5). R at 2 forbidden.

""GROVE"" -> G(1), R(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). R at 2 forbidden.

So positions matter.

Another word: ""HORDE"" -> H(1), O(2), R(3), D(4), E(5). 
- R at 3: allowed.
- O at 2: allowed.
- But no T? We need T in the word. ""HORDE"" has H, O, R, D, E — no T, but T is present. So invalid.

Similarly, ""FORTE"" -> F(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), E(5). 
- F at 1: new.
- O at 2: allowed.
- R at 3: allowed (since not 2 or 4).
- T at 4: allowed (not forbidden).
- E at 5: fixed.

And no C, A, N, S.

""FORTE"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""ROUTE"" has U, which is less common? But both are valid.

We can choose either.

But let's see which one tests a new letter that might be more informative.

In ""ROUTE"", we test U.
In ""FORTE"", we test F.

Both are new.

But we have to consider that the fifth letter might be one of these.

Since we don't know, we can pick one.

Another word: ""VOICE"" but C is absent.

""POISE"" but no R or T.

We need R and T.

""PRONE"" -> P(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5). But R at 2 forbidden, and N is absent.

""TRITE"" -> T(1), R(2), I(3), T(4), E(5). R at 2 forbidden.

""ORATE"" -> O(1), R(2), A(3), T(4), E(5). R at 2 forbidden, and A absent.

So back to ""ROUTE"", ""FORTE"", or ""PORTE"".

I think ""FORTE"" is a good choice because it has common letters.

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

We are on the third guess.

We can also consider that in ""store"", we had O at position 3 marked as wrong position, but in ""FORTE"", O is at position 2, which is different.

Similarly, in ""ROUTE"", O is at position 2.

But we don't know if O can be at 2 or not.

We have no information about position 2 except that it cannot be R or T.

So both are possible.

I'll go with ""FORTE"" as it is a common word.

But let's see the letters: in ""FORTE"", we have F, O, R, T, E.

We know O, R, T, E are present, so we are testing F.

If F is in the word, we get feedback; if not, we know it's absent.

Similarly for ""ROUTE"", testing U.

But F is more common? Not necessarily.

We can choose based on word frequency.

But for the sake of the game, I'll pick ""FORTE"".

Another idea: we can try to put R at position 1 or 3, and in ""FORTE"", R is at 3.

In ""ROUTE"", R is at 1.

We don't know which, so either is fine.

I think ""FORTE"" is a solid choice.

So I'll guess ""FORTE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C (absent), R (present, wrong position), A (absent), N (absent), E (correct, position 5).
- **Guess 2: ""store""** → S (absent), T (present, wrong position), O (present, wrong position), R (present, wrong position), E (correct, position 5).

### Key Insights:
- **E is confirmed** at position 5.
- **R, T, and O are present** in the word, but with position constraints:
  - R cannot be at position 2 (from ""crane"") or position 4 (from ""store""), so it must be at position 1 or 3.
  - T cannot be at position 2 (from ""store""), so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4.
  - O cannot be at position 3 (from ""store""), so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, S (cannot appear in the word).
- The word must include R, T, O, and E, plus one unknown letter (from the remaining untested letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test a word that:
  - Ends with E (position 5).
  - Includes R, T, and O in allowed positions (e.g., R at 1 or 3, T not at 2, O not at 3).
  - Uses a new common letter to gather more information.
  - Avoids absent letters (C, A, N, S).
- ""FORTE"" is a strong candidate:
  - **F** (new letter, tests for presence).
  - **O** at position 2 (allowed, since position 2 cannot be R or T, but O is permitted).
  - **R** at position 3 (allowed, as R cannot be at 2 or 4).
  - **T** at position 4 (allowed, as T cannot be at 2, but 4 is valid).
  - **E** at position 5 (confirmed).
- This guess tests the position of R (at 3), T (at 4), and O (at 2), while introducing F as a new letter. It also respects all constraints from previous feedback.",Guess 3: forte -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
