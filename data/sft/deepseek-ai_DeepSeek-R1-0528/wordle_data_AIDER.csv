We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know that:
- The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
- The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

Specifically:
- R is not in position 2.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

The secret word does not contain C or N.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that includes R, A, and E, and avoids C and N. Also, we should try to place R, A, and E in positions different from the first guess to get new information.

We also want to include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Let's remember the positions in ""crane"":
Position 1: C -> not in word
Position 2: R -> in word but not here
Position 3: A -> in word but not here
Position 4: N -> not in word
Position 5: E -> in word but not here

So R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

Now, for our next guess, we want to:
- Include R, A, E (since they are in the word) and try them in new positions.
- Avoid C and N (which we know are not in the word).
- Use other common consonants or vowels to cover more ground.

Possible new positions for R, A, and E:

For R: could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note the word has 5 letters.
We know R is not in position 2, so let's try to put R in position 1 or 4 or 5.

Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so let's try position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note position 1: we had C which is excluded, so A might be at 1? Or 2, 4, 5.

E cannot be at position 5, so we can try E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Since we have three letters that must be included (R, A, E), we can choose a word that uses these three and two new letters.

Let's brainstorm words that contain R, A, E and avoid C and N.

Some options:

- ""LARGE"": has L, A, R, G, E -> positions: L(1), A(2), R(3), G(4), E(5)
  However, we know E cannot be at position 5 from previous feedback? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so putting E at 5 again would be pointless? Actually, we can place E in a different position? But in ""LARGE"", E is at 5 again, which we know is wrong. So that might not help.

Better to avoid putting E at position 5.

Let's try for E not at the end.

Word: ""HEART"" -> H, E, A, R, T. Positions: E(2), A(3), R(4) -> but note our constraints: 
- R was not at position 2 previously, but now we are putting it at position 4 -> okay.
- A was not at position 3? In ""HEART"", A is at position 3? But previously A wasn't at position 3? Actually, the feedback did not say A couldn't be at position 3? Let me recheck:

The feedback for ""crane"" said A is in the word but not at position 3. So A cannot be at position 3? Exactly, so in ""HEART"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same as the forbidden position? No, wait: the secret word has A somewhere, but not at position 3. So if we try A at position 3 again, it would still be wrong? But actually, the secret word doesn't have A at position 3, so if we put A at 3 in our guess, we expect it to be marked as ""-"" again? But that would be redundant because we already know it's not there.

So ideally, we should place A in a new position to test if it might be there.

Similarly for the others.

So for ""HEART"":
- E is at position 2: which is new (previously at 5, so position 2 hasn't been tested for E? But the feedback doesn't directly say position 2 is forbidden for E? Only that position 5 is wrong for E. So E could be at position 2? We don't know yet.)

But note: we haven't tested E at position 2 before, so it could be correct or not. Similarly for A: in ""HEART"", A is at position 3. We know that the secret word's A is not at position 3 (from the first guess feedback: A was at 3 and got '-', meaning wrong position). So if we put A at 3 again, it will be incorrect again? Yes. So we might avoid that.

So putting A at position 3 again is not useful because we know it can't be there.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Therefore, let's think of words that place A and E in new positions.

Consider:

- ""ROATE"": is this a word? ""Roate"" is sometimes used in Wordle starting words. It means the same as ""rote""? Or is it accepted? But let's check. We must use only valid English words.

Alternative: ""TARES"" -> but that's 5 letters? T-A-R-E-S.

Word: ""TARES"" has T, A, R, E, S.

Positions:
1: T (new)
2: A (here we are putting A at position 2, which wasn't tested? In crane, A was at 3, so position 2 is new for A)
3: R (but R was at position 2 in crane and we know it's not at 2? So position 3 for R: we don't know yet? It could be possible?)
4: E (in crane, E was at 5 so position 4 is new for E)
5: S (new)

Also, we avoid C and N.

Additionally, we get to test new letters: T and S.

Is ""TARES"" a valid word? Yes, it is (a type of grass or something).

So feedback would be interesting:

We can get information about:
- Position 2: if A is correct or not? It might be or might not.
- Position 3: R? Might be or not?
- We also cover R, A, E which we know are in the word, and S and T which are new.

Another option: ""RAISE"" -> but R at position 1: we have no information about position 1 except that C is not there. We don't know if R can be at 1? It is possible.

In ""RAISE"":
1: R -> (previously R was at 2 and was wrong, but position 1 is new for R? So it might be correct)
2: A -> A was at 3 and wrong? Now at 2: new position? So we can test that.
3: I -> new letter
4: S -> new
5: E -> E was at 5 and wrong? So we shouldn't put E at 5 again? Because we know E is not at position 5? So that would be redundant? Similarly, position 5 is forbidden for E.

So in ""RAISE"", we have E at position 5 again? But we already know that position 5 is wrong for E? So we'll get 'x'? Or '-'? If E is in the word but not at 5, putting E at 5 again would still be marked as '-'? Because it's still in the word? So we already know that? And it doesn't tell us new information? So we want to avoid that.

Therefore, we want to try E in a new position? Positions 1, 2, 3, 4? Similarly for A and R.

So back to ""TARES"": 
- We have R at position 3: previously R was at 2 and it was wrong? Now we are testing position 3? But R is in the word, we need to know if it is at position 3? It could be a new position? So that might be useful? And A at position 2? And E at position 4? And new letters T and S? This seems good.

Also, ""TARES"" covers:

- T: new
- A: at position 2 (new position for A? Previously A was at 3 and wrong? So position 2 is untested? So might be correct)
- R: at position 3 (new? Previously at 2 and wrong? So position 3 is different? Could be correct or not? But we don't know? So we test it)
- E: at position 4 (new? Previously E was at 5 and wrong? So position 4 is untested? Might be correct or not? We test it)
- S: new

This seems good? Let me check for another word? Perhaps ""LATER""?

""LATER"": L, A, T, E, R
Positions: 
1: L? New
2: A? New position for A? Previously at 3? Now at 2? Good.
3: T? New
4: E? New position (was at 5? Now at 4? Good)
5: R? But we know R cannot be at position 2? But that doesn't directly forbid position 5? However, we are putting R at position 5? That's allowed? We haven't tested it? Could R be at 5? Yes? So we can try.

But in ""LATER"", note we have E at position 4 and R at position 5? But we don't have two E's? The secret word may have R and E? As per feedback? So that's fine? But we have R at position 5? That's acceptable? And E at position 4? Okay.

But ""LATER"" doesn't use the letter S? And S is common? Both are valid? But ""TARES"" seems to have S which is a common letter? So maybe better.

Another word: ""REACT""? But wait, we have C? But feedback said C is not in the word? So we cannot use ""REACT"" because it has C? That violates the exclusion.

So avoid words with C or N.

Therefore, I think ""TARES"" is a good choice? Or maybe ""STARE""? Same letters? Just rearranged? Let me see ""STARE"":

""STARE"": S, T, A, R, E
Positions:
1: S 
2: T?
Actually: 
S at 1, T at 2, A at 3, R at 4, E at 5? 
But wait, A at position 3: we know from the first guess that A is not at position 3? So we would be putting A at 3 again? Which we know is wrong? So that would give a '-' for sure? Which is redundant? So we avoid that? 

Similarly, in ""STARE"", E is at position 5? Which again we know is wrong? So we get '-' for E? So two of the positions we already know are wrong? That's inefficient? 

Therefore, ""TARES"" is better? Because:
""TARES"": T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, S at 5? 
Wait? How is ""TARES"" spelled? T-A-R-E-S? So positions: 
1: T 
2: A 
3: R 
4: E 
5: S

In this, we don't reuse the known wrong positions? Specifically: 
- A is at position 2? Previously it was at 3 and was wrong? So position 2 is new? 
- R at position 3? Previously it was at 2 and was wrong? So position 3 is new? 
- E at position 4? Previously it was at 5 and was wrong? So position 4 is new? 
And T and S are new letters? 

This seems ideal? 

But is ""TARES"" a valid word? Yes, as per Wordle dictionary? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""TARES"". 

Alternatively, if we want to avoid putting R at position 3? We don't know? It might be? But that's the point? 

Another word: ""ADIEU""? But we know E is in the word? And we need R? So we must include R? We have R, A, E that must be included? 

So missing R would not be good? 

So ""TARES"" seems solid? 

We could also do ""OATER""? But O is new? Is ""OATER"" common? 

But I think ""TARES"" is better? 

So our second guess: ""TARES""
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: not in word, R: in word but wrong position, A: in word but wrong position, N: not in word, E: in word but wrong position), we know the secret word contains R, A, and E, and excludes C and N. 

To maximize information, the new guess should:
- Include R, A, and E but avoid C and N.
- Test these letters in new positions: 
  - R was previously in position 2 (incorrect), so try it elsewhere.
  - A was previously in position 3 (incorrect), so avoid that position.
  - E was previously in position 5 (incorrect), so avoid that position.
- Introduce new common letters to test, like S or T.

A strong choice is **""TARES""**:
- Places A at position 2 (untested position), R at position 3 (untested position), and E at position 4 (untested position).
- Includes new letters T and S, both common and informative.
- Avoids redundant placements (no letter in a position already ruled out).

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while adhering to feedback.

<guess>tares</guess>",tares,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know that:
- The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
- The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

Specifically:
- R is not in position 2.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

The secret word does not contain C or N.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that includes R, A, and E, and avoids C and N. Also, we should try to place R, A, and E in positions different from the first guess to get new information.

We also want to include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Let's remember the positions in ""crane"":
Position 1: C -> not in word
Position 2: R -> in word but not here
Position 3: A -> in word but not here
Position 4: N -> not in word
Position 5: E -> in word but not here

So R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

Now, for our next guess, we want to:
- Include R, A, E (since they are in the word) and try them in new positions.
- Avoid C and N (which we know are not in the word).
- Use other common consonants or vowels to cover more ground.

Possible new positions for R, A, and E:

For R: could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note the word has 5 letters.
We know R is not in position 2, so let's try to put R in position 1 or 4 or 5.

Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so let's try position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note position 1: we had C which is excluded, so A might be at 1? Or 2, 4, 5.

E cannot be at position 5, so we can try E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Since we have three letters that must be included (R, A, E), we can choose a word that uses these three and two new letters.

Let's brainstorm words that contain R, A, E and avoid C and N.

Some options:

- ""LARGE"": has L, A, R, G, E -> positions: L(1), A(2), R(3), G(4), E(5)
  However, we know E cannot be at position 5 from previous feedback? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so putting E at 5 again would be pointless? Actually, we can place E in a different position? But in ""LARGE"", E is at 5 again, which we know is wrong. So that might not help.

Better to avoid putting E at position 5.

Let's try for E not at the end.

Word: ""HEART"" -> H, E, A, R, T. Positions: E(2), A(3), R(4) -> but note our constraints: 
- R was not at position 2 previously, but now we are putting it at position 4 -> okay.
- A was not at position 3? In ""HEART"", A is at position 3? But previously A wasn't at position 3? Actually, the feedback did not say A couldn't be at position 3? Let me recheck:

The feedback for ""crane"" said A is in the word but not at position 3. So A cannot be at position 3? Exactly, so in ""HEART"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same as the forbidden position? No, wait: the secret word has A somewhere, but not at position 3. So if we try A at position 3 again, it would still be wrong? But actually, the secret word doesn't have A at position 3, so if we put A at 3 in our guess, we expect it to be marked as ""-"" again? But that would be redundant because we already know it's not there.

So ideally, we should place A in a new position to test if it might be there.

Similarly for the others.

So for ""HEART"":
- E is at position 2: which is new (previously at 5, so position 2 hasn't been tested for E? But the feedback doesn't directly say position 2 is forbidden for E? Only that position 5 is wrong for E. So E could be at position 2? We don't know yet.)

But note: we haven't tested E at position 2 before, so it could be correct or not. Similarly for A: in ""HEART"", A is at position 3. We know that the secret word's A is not at position 3 (from the first guess feedback: A was at 3 and got '-', meaning wrong position). So if we put A at 3 again, it will be incorrect again? Yes. So we might avoid that.

So putting A at position 3 again is not useful because we know it can't be there.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Therefore, let's think of words that place A and E in new positions.

Consider:

- ""ROATE"": is this a word? ""Roate"" is sometimes used in Wordle starting words. It means the same as ""rote""? Or is it accepted? But let's check. We must use only valid English words.

Alternative: ""TARES"" -> but that's 5 letters? T-A-R-E-S.

Word: ""TARES"" has T, A, R, E, S.

Positions:
1: T (new)
2: A (here we are putting A at position 2, which wasn't tested? In crane, A was at 3, so position 2 is new for A)
3: R (but R was at position 2 in crane and we know it's not at 2? So position 3 for R: we don't know yet? It could be possible?)
4: E (in crane, E was at 5 so position 4 is new for E)
5: S (new)

Also, we avoid C and N.

Additionally, we get to test new letters: T and S.

Is ""TARES"" a valid word? Yes, it is (a type of grass or something).

So feedback would be interesting:

We can get information about:
- Position 2: if A is correct or not? It might be or might not.
- Position 3: R? Might be or not?
- We also cover R, A, E which we know are in the word, and S and T which are new.

Another option: ""RAISE"" -> but R at position 1: we have no information about position 1 except that C is not there. We don't know if R can be at 1? It is possible.

In ""RAISE"":
1: R -> (previously R was at 2 and was wrong, but position 1 is new for R? So it might be correct)
2: A -> A was at 3 and wrong? Now at 2: new position? So we can test that.
3: I -> new letter
4: S -> new
5: E -> E was at 5 and wrong? So we shouldn't put E at 5 again? Because we know E is not at position 5? So that would be redundant? Similarly, position 5 is forbidden for E.

So in ""RAISE"", we have E at position 5 again? But we already know that position 5 is wrong for E? So we'll get 'x'? Or '-'? If E is in the word but not at 5, putting E at 5 again would still be marked as '-'? Because it's still in the word? So we already know that? And it doesn't tell us new information? So we want to avoid that.

Therefore, we want to try E in a new position? Positions 1, 2, 3, 4? Similarly for A and R.

So back to ""TARES"": 
- We have R at position 3: previously R was at 2 and it was wrong? Now we are testing position 3? But R is in the word, we need to know if it is at position 3? It could be a new position? So that might be useful? And A at position 2? And E at position 4? And new letters T and S? This seems good.

Also, ""TARES"" covers:

- T: new
- A: at position 2 (new position for A? Previously A was at 3 and wrong? So position 2 is untested? So might be correct)
- R: at position 3 (new? Previously at 2 and wrong? So position 3 is different? Could be correct or not? But we don't know? So we test it)
- E: at position 4 (new? Previously E was at 5 and wrong? So position 4 is untested? Might be correct or not? We test it)
- S: new

This seems good? Let me check for another word? Perhaps ""LATER""?

""LATER"": L, A, T, E, R
Positions: 
1: L? New
2: A? New position for A? Previously at 3? Now at 2? Good.
3: T? New
4: E? New position (was at 5? Now at 4? Good)
5: R? But we know R cannot be at position 2? But that doesn't directly forbid position 5? However, we are putting R at position 5? That's allowed? We haven't tested it? Could R be at 5? Yes? So we can try.

But in ""LATER"", note we have E at position 4 and R at position 5? But we don't have two E's? The secret word may have R and E? As per feedback? So that's fine? But we have R at position 5? That's acceptable? And E at position 4? Okay.

But ""LATER"" doesn't use the letter S? And S is common? Both are valid? But ""TARES"" seems to have S which is a common letter? So maybe better.

Another word: ""REACT""? But wait, we have C? But feedback said C is not in the word? So we cannot use ""REACT"" because it has C? That violates the exclusion.

So avoid words with C or N.

Therefore, I think ""TARES"" is a good choice? Or maybe ""STARE""? Same letters? Just rearranged? Let me see ""STARE"":

""STARE"": S, T, A, R, E
Positions:
1: S 
2: T?
Actually: 
S at 1, T at 2, A at 3, R at 4, E at 5? 
But wait, A at position 3: we know from the first guess that A is not at position 3? So we would be putting A at 3 again? Which we know is wrong? So that would give a '-' for sure? Which is redundant? So we avoid that? 

Similarly, in ""STARE"", E is at position 5? Which again we know is wrong? So we get '-' for E? So two of the positions we already know are wrong? That's inefficient? 

Therefore, ""TARES"" is better? Because:
""TARES"": T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, S at 5? 
Wait? How is ""TARES"" spelled? T-A-R-E-S? So positions: 
1: T 
2: A 
3: R 
4: E 
5: S

In this, we don't reuse the known wrong positions? Specifically: 
- A is at position 2? Previously it was at 3 and was wrong? So position 2 is new? 
- R at position 3? Previously it was at 2 and was wrong? So position 3 is new? 
- E at position 4? Previously it was at 5 and was wrong? So position 4 is new? 
And T and S are new letters? 

This seems ideal? 

But is ""TARES"" a valid word? Yes, as per Wordle dictionary? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""TARES"". 

Alternatively, if we want to avoid putting R at position 3? We don't know? It might be? But that's the point? 

Another word: ""ADIEU""? But we know E is in the word? And we need R? So we must include R? We have R, A, E that must be included? 

So missing R would not be good? 

So ""TARES"" seems solid? 

We could also do ""OATER""? But O is new? Is ""OATER"" common? 

But I think ""TARES"" is better? 

So our second guess: ""TARES""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: not in word, R: in word but wrong position, A: in word but wrong position, N: not in word, E: in word but wrong position), we know the secret word contains R, A, and E, and excludes C and N. 

To maximize information, the new guess should:
- Include R, A, and E but avoid C and N.
- Test these letters in new positions: 
  - R was previously in position 2 (incorrect), so try it elsewhere.
  - A was previously in position 3 (incorrect), so avoid that position.
  - E was previously in position 5 (incorrect), so avoid that position.
- Introduce new common letters to test, like S or T.

A strong choice is **""TARES""**:
- Places A at position 2 (untested position), R at position 3 (untested position), and E at position 4 (untested position).
- Includes new letters T and S, both common and informative.
- Avoids redundant placements (no letter in a position already ruled out).

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while adhering to feedback.",Guess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) R(-) E(✓) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,AIDER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know that:
- The letters C and N are not in the secret word.
- The letters R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

Specifically:
- R is not in position 2.
- A is not in position 3.
- E is not in position 5.

The secret word does not contain C or N.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that includes R, A, and E, and avoids C and N. Also, we should try to place R, A, and E in positions different from the first guess to get new information.

We also want to include other common letters to test more possibilities.

Let's remember the positions in ""crane"":
Position 1: C -> not in word
Position 2: R -> in word but not here
Position 3: A -> in word but not here
Position 4: N -> not in word
Position 5: E -> in word but not here

So R cannot be in position 2, A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.

Now, for our next guess, we want to:
- Include R, A, E (since they are in the word) and try them in new positions.
- Avoid C and N (which we know are not in the word).
- Use other common consonants or vowels to cover more ground.

Possible new positions for R, A, and E:

For R: could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5? But note the word has 5 letters.
We know R is not in position 2, so let's try to put R in position 1 or 4 or 5.

Similarly, A cannot be in position 3, so let's try position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But note position 1: we had C which is excluded, so A might be at 1? Or 2, 4, 5.

E cannot be at position 5, so we can try E at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Since we have three letters that must be included (R, A, E), we can choose a word that uses these three and two new letters.

Let's brainstorm words that contain R, A, E and avoid C and N.

Some options:

- ""LARGE"": has L, A, R, G, E -> positions: L(1), A(2), R(3), G(4), E(5)
  However, we know E cannot be at position 5 from previous feedback? Wait, the feedback said E is in the word but not in position 5, so putting E at 5 again would be pointless? Actually, we can place E in a different position? But in ""LARGE"", E is at 5 again, which we know is wrong. So that might not help.

Better to avoid putting E at position 5.

Let's try for E not at the end.

Word: ""HEART"" -> H, E, A, R, T. Positions: E(2), A(3), R(4) -> but note our constraints: 
- R was not at position 2 previously, but now we are putting it at position 4 -> okay.
- A was not at position 3? In ""HEART"", A is at position 3? But previously A wasn't at position 3? Actually, the feedback did not say A couldn't be at position 3? Let me recheck:

The feedback for ""crane"" said A is in the word but not at position 3. So A cannot be at position 3? Exactly, so in ""HEART"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same as the forbidden position? No, wait: the secret word has A somewhere, but not at position 3. So if we try A at position 3 again, it would still be wrong? But actually, the secret word doesn't have A at position 3, so if we put A at 3 in our guess, we expect it to be marked as ""-"" again? But that would be redundant because we already know it's not there.

So ideally, we should place A in a new position to test if it might be there.

Similarly for the others.

So for ""HEART"":
- E is at position 2: which is new (previously at 5, so position 2 hasn't been tested for E? But the feedback doesn't directly say position 2 is forbidden for E? Only that position 5 is wrong for E. So E could be at position 2? We don't know yet.)

But note: we haven't tested E at position 2 before, so it could be correct or not. Similarly for A: in ""HEART"", A is at position 3. We know that the secret word's A is not at position 3 (from the first guess feedback: A was at 3 and got '-', meaning wrong position). So if we put A at 3 again, it will be incorrect again? Yes. So we might avoid that.

So putting A at position 3 again is not useful because we know it can't be there.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3 and E at position 5.

Therefore, let's think of words that place A and E in new positions.

Consider:

- ""ROATE"": is this a word? ""Roate"" is sometimes used in Wordle starting words. It means the same as ""rote""? Or is it accepted? But let's check. We must use only valid English words.

Alternative: ""TARES"" -> but that's 5 letters? T-A-R-E-S.

Word: ""TARES"" has T, A, R, E, S.

Positions:
1: T (new)
2: A (here we are putting A at position 2, which wasn't tested? In crane, A was at 3, so position 2 is new for A)
3: R (but R was at position 2 in crane and we know it's not at 2? So position 3 for R: we don't know yet? It could be possible?)
4: E (in crane, E was at 5 so position 4 is new for E)
5: S (new)

Also, we avoid C and N.

Additionally, we get to test new letters: T and S.

Is ""TARES"" a valid word? Yes, it is (a type of grass or something).

So feedback would be interesting:

We can get information about:
- Position 2: if A is correct or not? It might be or might not.
- Position 3: R? Might be or not?
- We also cover R, A, E which we know are in the word, and S and T which are new.

Another option: ""RAISE"" -> but R at position 1: we have no information about position 1 except that C is not there. We don't know if R can be at 1? It is possible.

In ""RAISE"":
1: R -> (previously R was at 2 and was wrong, but position 1 is new for R? So it might be correct)
2: A -> A was at 3 and wrong? Now at 2: new position? So we can test that.
3: I -> new letter
4: S -> new
5: E -> E was at 5 and wrong? So we shouldn't put E at 5 again? Because we know E is not at position 5? So that would be redundant? Similarly, position 5 is forbidden for E.

So in ""RAISE"", we have E at position 5 again? But we already know that position 5 is wrong for E? So we'll get 'x'? Or '-'? If E is in the word but not at 5, putting E at 5 again would still be marked as '-'? Because it's still in the word? So we already know that? And it doesn't tell us new information? So we want to avoid that.

Therefore, we want to try E in a new position? Positions 1, 2, 3, 4? Similarly for A and R.

So back to ""TARES"": 
- We have R at position 3: previously R was at 2 and it was wrong? Now we are testing position 3? But R is in the word, we need to know if it is at position 3? It could be a new position? So that might be useful? And A at position 2? And E at position 4? And new letters T and S? This seems good.

Also, ""TARES"" covers:

- T: new
- A: at position 2 (new position for A? Previously A was at 3 and wrong? So position 2 is untested? So might be correct)
- R: at position 3 (new? Previously at 2 and wrong? So position 3 is different? Could be correct or not? But we don't know? So we test it)
- E: at position 4 (new? Previously E was at 5 and wrong? So position 4 is untested? Might be correct or not? We test it)
- S: new

This seems good? Let me check for another word? Perhaps ""LATER""?

""LATER"": L, A, T, E, R
Positions: 
1: L? New
2: A? New position for A? Previously at 3? Now at 2? Good.
3: T? New
4: E? New position (was at 5? Now at 4? Good)
5: R? But we know R cannot be at position 2? But that doesn't directly forbid position 5? However, we are putting R at position 5? That's allowed? We haven't tested it? Could R be at 5? Yes? So we can try.

But in ""LATER"", note we have E at position 4 and R at position 5? But we don't have two E's? The secret word may have R and E? As per feedback? So that's fine? But we have R at position 5? That's acceptable? And E at position 4? Okay.

But ""LATER"" doesn't use the letter S? And S is common? Both are valid? But ""TARES"" seems to have S which is a common letter? So maybe better.

Another word: ""REACT""? But wait, we have C? But feedback said C is not in the word? So we cannot use ""REACT"" because it has C? That violates the exclusion.

So avoid words with C or N.

Therefore, I think ""TARES"" is a good choice? Or maybe ""STARE""? Same letters? Just rearranged? Let me see ""STARE"":

""STARE"": S, T, A, R, E
Positions:
1: S 
2: T?
Actually: 
S at 1, T at 2, A at 3, R at 4, E at 5? 
But wait, A at position 3: we know from the first guess that A is not at position 3? So we would be putting A at 3 again? Which we know is wrong? So that would give a '-' for sure? Which is redundant? So we avoid that? 

Similarly, in ""STARE"", E is at position 5? Which again we know is wrong? So we get '-' for E? So two of the positions we already know are wrong? That's inefficient? 

Therefore, ""TARES"" is better? Because:
""TARES"": T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, S at 5? 
Wait? How is ""TARES"" spelled? T-A-R-E-S? So positions: 
1: T 
2: A 
3: R 
4: E 
5: S

In this, we don't reuse the known wrong positions? Specifically: 
- A is at position 2? Previously it was at 3 and was wrong? So position 2 is new? 
- R at position 3? Previously it was at 2 and was wrong? So position 3 is new? 
- E at position 4? Previously it was at 5 and was wrong? So position 4 is new? 
And T and S are new letters? 

This seems ideal? 

But is ""TARES"" a valid word? Yes, as per Wordle dictionary? 

Therefore, I'll guess ""TARES"". 

Alternatively, if we want to avoid putting R at position 3? We don't know? It might be? But that's the point? 

Another word: ""ADIEU""? But we know E is in the word? And we need R? So we must include R? We have R, A, E that must be included? 

So missing R would not be good? 

So ""TARES"" seems solid? 

We could also do ""OATER""? But O is new? Is ""OATER"" common? 

But I think ""TARES"" is better? 

So our second guess: ""TARES""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: not in word, R: in word but wrong position, A: in word but wrong position, N: not in word, E: in word but wrong position), we know the secret word contains R, A, and E, and excludes C and N. 

To maximize information, the new guess should:
- Include R, A, and E but avoid C and N.
- Test these letters in new positions: 
  - R was previously in position 2 (incorrect), so try it elsewhere.
  - A was previously in position 3 (incorrect), so avoid that position.
  - E was previously in position 5 (incorrect), so avoid that position.
- Introduce new common letters to test, like S or T.

A strong choice is **""TARES""**:
- Places A at position 2 (untested position), R at position 3 (untested position), and E at position 4 (untested position).
- Includes new letters T and S, both common and informative.
- Avoids redundant placements (no letter in a position already ruled out).

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while adhering to feedback.

Let me see ""STARE"":\n\n""STARE"": S, T, A, R, E\nPositions:\n1: S \n2: T?\nActually: \nS at 1, T at 2, A at 3, R at 4, E at 5? \nBut wait, A at position 3: we know from the first guess that A is not at position 3? So we would be putting A at 3 again? Which we know is wrong? So that would give a \'-\' for sure? Which is redundant? So we avoid that? \n\nSimilarly, in ""STARE"", E is at position 5? Which again we know is wrong? So we get \'-\' for E? So two of the positions we already know are wrong? That\'s inefficient? \n\nTherefore, ""TARES"" is better? Because:\n""TARES"": T at 1, A at 2, R at 3, E at 4, S at 5? \nWait? How is ""TARES"" spelled? T-A-R-E-S? So positions: \n1: T \n2: A \n3: R \n4: E \n5: S\n\nIn this, we don\'t reuse the known wrong positions? Specifically: \n- A is at position 2? Previously it was at 3 and was wrong? So position 2 is new? \n- R at position 3? Previously it was at 2 and was wrong? So position 3 is new? \n- E at position 4? Previously it was at 5 and was wrong? So position 4 is new? \nAnd T and S are new letters? \n\nThis seems ideal? \n\nBut is ""TARES"" a valid word? Yes, as per Wordle dictionary? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""TARES"". \n\nAlternatively, if we want to avoid putting R at position 3? We don\'t know? It might be? But that\'s the point? \n\nAnother word: ""ADIEU""? But we know E is in the word? And we need R? So we must include R? We have R, A, E that must be included? \n\nSo missing R would not be good? \n\nSo ""TARES"" seems solid? \n\nWe could also do ""OATER""? But O is new? Is ""OATER"" common? \n\nBut I think ""TARES"" is better? \n\nSo our second guess: ""TARES""Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: not in word, R: in word but wrong position, A: in word but wrong position, N: not in word, E: in word but wrong position), we know the secret word contains R, A, and E, and excludes C and N. \n\nTo maximize information, the new guess should:\n- Include R, A, and E but avoid C and N.\n- Test these letters in new positions: \n  - R was previously in position 2 (incorrect), so try it elsewhere.\n  - A was previously in position 3 (incorrect), so avoid that position.\n  - E was previously in position 5 (incorrect), so avoid that position.\n- Introduce new common letters to test, like S or T.\n\nA strong choice is **""TARES""**:\n- Places A at position 2 (untested position), R at position 3 (untested position), and E at position 4 (untested position).\n- Includes new letters T and S, both common and informative.\n- Avoids redundant placements (no letter in a position already ruled out).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while adhering to feedback.\n\n<guess>tares</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tares -> FEEDBACK: T(x) A(-) R(-) E(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains R, A, and E, but not in positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively.
- The letters C and N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""tares""
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)
- S: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4 (since E is the 4th letter in ""tares"").
- T and S are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (because we got '-' for A at position 2).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (because we got '-' for R at position 3).

Now, combining all information:

Letters in the word: R, A, E (from first guess) and we confirmed E is in the word and now we know it's at position 4. Also, from the second guess, we know A and R are still in the word (since we got '-' for them) but in wrong positions.

Letters not in the word: C, N (from first guess), T, S (from second guess).

Positions:
- E is fixed at position 4: so the 4th letter is E.

For A:
- Not in position 3 (from first guess: crane had A at position 3 and got '-')
- Not in position 2 (from second guess: tares had A at position 2 and got '-')
- So A cannot be in position 2 or 3. Possible positions: 1 or 5? (since position 4 is taken by E)

For R:
- Not in position 2 (from first guess: crane had R at position 2 and got '-')
- Not in position 3 (from second guess: tares had R at position 3 and got '-')
- So R cannot be in position 2 or 3. Possible positions: 1 or 5? (position 4 is E, so not available)

But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is E.

So for A and R, they must be in positions 1 and 5? But we have two letters and two positions? However, we don't know which one is where? And also, there is one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters: we have A, R, E, and two more letters? But we know E is at 4, so positions 1,2,3,5 are for the other letters? But we have A and R to place, and one more letter? Because we have three known letters: A, R, E? But the word has five letters? So there are two more letters we don't know? But we have eliminated C, N, T, S? So we need to find two more letters that are in the word.

We also know that from the feedback, we have:

- Position 1: we don't know? But we have tried C (not in word) and T (not in word). So the first letter is not C, T, and also not N? But we don't know what it is? Similarly, position 2: we had R (which is in word but not here) and A (in word but not here)? So position 2 is not R, not A? And we know it's not C, N, T, S? So we need to consider other letters.

Let's list the constraints:

Known letters in the word: A, R, E (with E at position 4)

Known letters not in the word: C, N, T, S

So the secret word has two more letters? Let's call them X and Y? They are from the remaining alphabet? Excluding A, R, E (which are in) and C, N, T, S (which are out)? And also excluding the known positions? But we don't know the positions of A and R? And we have to find X and Y.

Possible positions for the secret word:

Position 1: must be one of: A, R, or a new letter? But we know A and R are in the word? So position 1 could be A, R, or one of the unknown letters? Similarly for other positions.

But we have constraints:

- Position 1: cannot be C, N, T, S (known not in word). Also, if it were A, that's possible? But we don't know? Similarly for R.

But we have more constraints from the feedback:

For A: cannot be at position 2 or 3? So A must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is E? So only positions 1 and 5 are available for A? Similarly for R: cannot be at position 2 or 3? So R must be at position 1 or 5? But positions 1 and 5 are only two positions? And we have two letters A and R? So they must occupy positions 1 and 5? But which one is which?

Also, position 2 and 3 must be filled by the two unknown letters? Because positions: 1,2,3,4,5? 4 is E? So 1,2,3,5? But 1 and 5 are taken by A and R? Then 2 and 3 must be the two unknown letters? But we have two unknown letters? So the word structure is:

Position 1: either A or R
Position 2: an unknown letter (not A, R, E? because E is at 4? But E is only once? We don't know if there are duplicates? But the feedback hasn't shown duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? Because if there were duplicates, the feedback might show multiple? But in Wordle, duplicates are possible? But in this case, we haven't seen any indication? So let's assume no duplicates for now? Unless forced.

But in the feedback, we have only one E? And it's at position 4? So if E were duplicated, we might have seen another '-'? But we didn't? So probably no duplicates? Similarly for A and R? So we assume all letters are distinct? For simplicity? But we should be cautious? However, the feedback for ""crane"" and ""tares"" didn't show any duplicate? So likely the word has distinct letters? So we'll assume that.

Therefore, the secret word has 5 distinct letters: A, R, E, and two others? Let's call them X and Y? And E is at position 4.

Now, positions:
- Position 1: either A or R? (since they must be at 1 or 5? and not 2,3)
- Position 5: the other of A or R? (if position 1 is A, then position 5 is R? or vice versa)
- Position 2: must be X? (one of the unknown letters)
- Position 3: must be Y? (the other unknown letter)

But we also have constraints from the feedback? Specifically, when we guessed ""crane"", we had R at position 2? And it was marked as '-'? Meaning R is in the word but not at position 2? Which we already used? Similarly, in ""tares"", we had A at position 2? And it was marked as '-'? So A is not at position 2? Which we also used? And R at position 3? Marked as '-'? So R not at 3? And A not at 3? From first guess? So position 2 and 3 are not for A or R? So they must be for the unknown letters? So that matches.

Now, what about the unknown letters? We know they are not C, N, T, S? And not A, R, E? So we need to choose from the remaining letters? But we have to form a valid English word.

Also, we have the feedback for the positions? For example, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5? And it was marked as '-'? Meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? But now we know E is at position 4? So that's consistent? Because position 5 is not E? So that's fine.

Now, for the next guess, we need to test the possibilities for positions 1 and 5? And also find the two unknown letters? But we have limited tries? So we should choose a word that can help us determine whether A is at position 1 or 5? And R at the other? And also test possible letters for positions 2 and 3.

But we don't know what the unknown letters are? So we need to cover common letters? But we have eliminated C, N, T, S? So the remaining common letters? Like L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

But we also have the constraint that the word must have E at position 4? And positions 1 and 5 are either A or R? So the word must be of the form:

Option 1: A _ _ E R
Option 2: R _ _ E A

And the two blanks are two unknown letters? Which are not C, N, T, S? And not A, R, E? (assuming distinct).

So we can think of words that fit these patterns? And use common letters? But we need to make a guess that will help us distinguish? And also get information about the unknown letters.

But we have two possibilities for the pattern? So we can choose a word that tests one of the patterns? Or we can choose a word that has common letters? But we must include E at position 4? And we must include either A or R at position 1 or 5? But we don't know which? So we might have to commit to one? Or we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily follow the pattern? But that might be less efficient? Because we know E is at 4? So we should keep that? And we know A and R are in the word? So we should include them? But in new positions? But the only new positions for A and R are 1 and 5? So we have to put them at 1 or 5? But we don't know which? So we can try one of the patterns? For example, try the pattern A _ _ E R? If we get feedback that A is at position 1? Or not? Similarly.

But we can also include common letters for the blanks? So let's list possible words for the two patterns:

Pattern 1: A _ _ E R
Possible words: ALTER? But T is not in the word? We know T is not in the word? So we cannot use T? Similarly, AGER? But that's 4 letters? Or AIDER? But that's 5? A-I-D-E-R? But D is possible? But let's see: AIDER? But we have E at 4? So A-I-D-E-R? Positions: A(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), R(5)? That fits the pattern? And I and D are not excluded? So it's possible? But is ""AIDER"" a word? Yes, meaning one who aids? Or more commonly ""aider"".

Similarly, other words: ALTER? But T is excluded? Not allowed? Because T is not in the word? So we cannot use T? Similarly, S is excluded? So no S? C, N, T, S are out? So for pattern A _ _ E R, we need two letters that are not C,N,T,S? And not A,R,E? So the blanks can be: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But we want common ones? Like L, I, D, etc.

Possible words: AIDER (A,I,D,E,R) -> I and D are new? And we can test? But we don't know if A is at position 1? Or R at position 5? So if we guess ""AIDER"", then:

- If the secret word is A _ _ E R, then we might get A(✓) and R(✓) if they are in the right positions? But we don't know? It might be that the word is R _ _ E A? So if we guess AIDER, and the word is R _ _ E A, then A at position 1 would be wrong? And R at position 5 would be wrong? So we get feedback that A is not at 1? And R is not at 5? Then we know the pattern must be R _ _ E A? And we can then guess accordingly? So that would be informative? But we use one guess to test the pattern? And then we know? But we have 4 guesses left? So it might be acceptable? But we can also try to cover more? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has the pattern but also tests common letters? But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has E at position 4? And includes A and R? But not necessarily at position 1 and 5? But we know that A and R must be at 1 or 5? Because they cannot be at 2 or 3? And position 4 is E? So they must be at 1 or 5? So we have to put them at 1 or 5? So we cannot avoid that? So we have to choose between the two patterns? Or we can choose a word that has one of the patterns? And use common letters for the blanks? 

But let's list possible words for pattern 1: A _ _ E R? With the two blanks being letters not in {C,N,T,S}? And not A,R,E? 

Possible words:
- AIDER: A,I,D,E,R -> I and D are new? And valid? 
- ALTER: but T is excluded? Not allowed? 
- AGER? 4 letters? 
- ABLER: A,B,L,E,R? But is ""ABLER"" a word? It's comparative of able? But usually ""abler""? Yes? But it's 5 letters? So A-B-L-E-R? But E is at position 4? So positions: A(1), B(2), L(3), E(4), R(5)? Yes? And B and L are not excluded? 
- ADZER? Not common? 
- AFIRE: A,F,I,R,E? But E is at position 5? But we need E at position 4? So not? 
- AGLET? T excluded? 
- AIDER and ABLER seem possible? 

For pattern 2: R _ _ E A? 
- RILED? R,I,L,E,D? But E is at position 4? So R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)? But we need A at position 5? But here D is at 5? Not A? 
- We need the word to end with A? So R _ _ E A? 
- RARER? But R repeated? And A at position 2? But we know A cannot be at position 2? And also, we assume distinct? So not? 
- RACER? But C excluded? 
- RAGER? R,A,G,E,R? R repeated? And A at position 2? But A cannot be at position 2? 
- RAPER? R,A,P,E,R? R repeated? 
- RATER? T excluded? 
- RAVER? R,A,V,E,R? R repeated? 
- RAVEN? N excluded? 
- RAYED? R,A,Y,E,D? But A at position 2? Not allowed? Because we know A cannot be at position 2? 
- So we need a word with R at 1, then two letters? Then E at 4? Then A at 5? And no repeated letters? And the two letters not C,N,T,S? 
- Possible: RIBEY? Not a word? 
- RICED? C excluded? 
- RIDGE? D and G? But E at position 5? Not 4? 
- RIFLE? E at 5? 
- RILEA? R,I,L,E,A? But E at position 4? So R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), A(5)? Yes? And I and L are new? And not excluded? 
- Is ""RILEA"" a word? It might be a genus of grass? Or not common? But in Wordle, it might be accepted? 
- Other: RUPEE? But E repeated? And not ending with A? 
- RUSHA? Not common? 
- So ""RILEA"" might be a possibility? But let's see if there are better? 

But we don't know which pattern? So we need to test? 

Alternatively, we can make a guess that doesn't follow the pattern? But that might not be efficient? Because we know E is at 4? So we should keep that? And we know A and R are in the word? So we should include them? But if we put A and R in positions 1 and 5? Then we are testing one pattern? 

But we can also include new letters? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has the pattern but uses common letters? And then based on the feedback, we can determine the pattern? 

For example, guess ""AIDER"": 
- If the secret word is A _ _ E R, then we might get A(✓), I(?), D(?), E(✓), R(✓) if the letters match? But if not, we get feedback on I and D? 
- If the secret word is R _ _ E A, then we get A at position 1: since A is in the word but not at position 1? So we get '-' for A? And R at position 5: R is in the word but not at position 5? So we get '-' for R? And E is at 4? So we get E(✓)? And I and D: if they are in the word? Or not? 

But we don't know the unknown letters? So it might be messy? 

Perhaps we can choose a word that has the same pattern but with letters that are common? And then see which one fits? 

But we have to make a guess? 

Another thought: we have position 2 and 3 to fill? And we need to test letters? So we can choose a word that has common letters for position 2 and 3? And also tests the pattern? 

But let's list the possible words for both patterns? 

Pattern 1: A X Y E R? With X and Y not in {C,N,T,S,A,R,E}? 
Possible words: 
- AIDER: X=I, Y=D
- ABLER: X=B, Y=L
- AGLER? G and L? But E at 4? A-G-L-E-R? So X=G, Y=L? 
- AIDER, ABLER, AGLER? 

Pattern 2: R X Y E A? With X and Y not in {C,N,T,S,A,R,E}? 
Possible words: 
- RILEA: X=I, Y=L? R-I-L-E-A? 
- RICEA? C excluded? 
- RIFLE? But E at 5? 
- RIVEA? R-I-V-E-A? So X=I, Y=V? 
- Is ""RIVEA"" a word? Not common? 
- ROPED? P and D? But E at 4? R-O-P-E-D? But we need A at 5? 
- RUDER? D and E? But E repeated? 
- RULER? L and E? E repeated? 
- So few options? RILEA might be the only common one? Or not? 

But ""RILEA"" is not very common? 

Perhaps we can try a different approach? Instead of committing to the pattern, we can guess a word that has E at position 4? And includes A and R? But in positions that are not 1 or 5? But we know they cannot be at 2 or 3? So the only positions are 1 and 5? So we have to put them there? 

So we must choose one pattern? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the two unknown letters? But we don't know what they are? So we can use a word with common letters for position 2 and 3? And also have A and R at 1 and 5? 

But we have to choose which pattern? 

Let's try to guess ""AIDER"" for pattern 1? 

If we guess ""AIDER"": 
- If the secret word is A _ _ E R, then we might get some matches? 
- If not, then it must be pattern 2? 

But we have only 4 guesses left? So it's acceptable? 

But let's see the feedback we would get? 

Case 1: secret word is A X Y E R? 
- If X and Y are I and D? Then we get all correct? But unlikely? 
- If not, then for ""AIDER"": 
  - A at 1: if the secret word has A at 1, then ✓? 
  - I at 2: if the secret word has I at 2? Or if not, then if I is in the word but wrong position? Or not in word? 
  - D at 3: similarly? 
  - E at 4: ✓ 
  - R at 5: if secret word has R at 5, then ✓? 

Case 2: secret word is R X Y E A? 
- A at 1: but secret word has A at 5? So A is in the word but not at 1? So '-' for A? 
- I at 2: if I is in the word? Or not? 
- D at 3: similarly? 
- E at 4: ✓ 
- R at 5: but secret word has R at 1? So R is in the word but not at 5? So '-' for R? 

So in case 2, we get: A(-), I(?), D(?), E(✓), R(-) 

And we know that the pattern must be R _ _ E A? Because if A and R are not at 1 and 5 in this guess, then they must be at the other positions? 

So from the feedback, if we get A and R both with '-' in this guess, then we know the pattern is R _ _ E A? And we can then guess a word for that pattern? 

If we get A and R both with '✓', then it's pattern 1 and we might have the word? Or not? 

If we get mixed? For example, A✓ and R-? But that would be impossible? Because if A is at 1, then pattern 1? And R should be at 5? So if R is not at 5, then it's not pattern 1? But we have no other patterns? So it must be that if A is at 1, then R must be at 5? And vice versa? So mixed feedback shouldn't happen? 

Similarly, if A is not at 1, then R is not at 5? And pattern 2? 

So the feedback will tell us the pattern? 

Also, we get information about I and D? 

So ""AIDER"" seems a good guess? 

But we can also choose a word with more common letters? Like ""ABLER"" with B and L? 

But ""AIDER"" is fine? 

Another common word: ""LARGE""? But L and G? But we have E at 5? Not 4? And also, we know E is at 4? So we must have E at 4? 

So I think ""AIDER"" is a reasonable choice? 

But let's confirm the letters: A, I, D, E, R? 
- I and D are not excluded? 
- E is at position 4? 
- A at 1, R at 5? 

So we'll guess ""AIDER"". 

But we have to output the guess? 

Alternatively, to be safe, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to the pattern but still has E at 4 and includes A and R? But we have to put A and R in positions 1 or 5? Because they can't be elsewhere? 

So I think ""AIDER"" is fine. 

But let's see if there's a word that can test both patterns? But I don't think so? 

Another idea: guess a word that has the unknown letters? But we don't know? 

So I'll go with ""AIDER"".

### Analysis of Feedback and Deductions

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-)  
  Meaning:  
  - C and N are **not** in the word.  
  - R, A, and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions:  
    - R is not in position 2.  
    - A is not in position 3.  
    - E is not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: TARES**  
  Feedback: T(x), A(-), R(-), E(✓), S(x)  
  Meaning:  
  - T and S are **not** in the word.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - E is **correct** and in position 4.  

### Key Constraints
1. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - E is in the word and **fixed at position 4**.  
   - A and R are in the word but **not** in positions 2 or 3 (from both guesses).  
   - Since position 4 is taken by E, A and R must be in positions 1 or 5 (the only remaining spots).  

2. **Excluded letters**: C, N, T, S (cannot appear in the word).  

3. **Positional constraints**:  
   - Position 1: Cannot be C, N, T, S. Must be A or R.  
   - Position 2: Cannot be A (from TARES feedback), R (from CRANE feedback), C, N, T, S, or E (E is at 4). Must be a new letter.  
   - Position 3: Cannot be A (from CRANE), R (from TARES), C, N, T, S, or E. Must be a new letter.  
   - Position 4: E (fixed).  
   - Position 5: Cannot be E (from CRANE feedback). Must be A or R (whichever is not in position 1).  

4. **Word structure**:  
   The secret word must be one of two patterns:  
   - **Pattern 1**: `A _ _ E R` (A at 1, R at 5)  
   - **Pattern 2**: `R _ _ E A` (R at 1, A at 5)  
   The blanks (positions 2 and 3) must be filled with letters not in {A, R, E, C, N, T, S}.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- We need to test which pattern is correct (A at 1/R at 5 vs. R at 1/A at 5) while gathering information about the unknown letters in positions 2 and 3.  
- **Optimal approach**: Guess a word that fits **Pattern 1** (`A _ _ E R`) using common letters for positions 2 and 3. This will:  
  - Confirm or rule out Pattern 1.  
  - Provide feedback on the new letters in positions 2 and 3.  
- If Pattern 1 is incorrect, the word must be Pattern 2 (`R _ _ E A`), and we can adjust in the next guess.  
- We choose **AIDER** (A-I-D-E-R) because:  
  - It fits Pattern 1: A at 1, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5.  
  - Uses common letters (I and D) for positions 2 and 3.  
  - Avoids excluded letters (C, N, T, S).  

### Expected Feedback from AIDER
- If **Pattern 1 is correct** (secret word is `A _ _ E R`):  
  - A(✓) if A is at position 1.  
  - R(✓) if R is at position 5.  
  - Feedback on I (position 2) and D (position 3) will reveal if they are correct or in the word.  
- If **Pattern 2 is correct** (secret word is `R _ _ E A`):  
  - A(-) because A is at position 5, not 1.  
  - R(-) because R is at position 1, not 5.  
  - E(✓) remains fixed.  
  - Feedback on I and D will help identify the unknown letters.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities with minimal risk.

<guess>aider</guess>",aider,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains R, A, and E, but not in positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively.
- The letters C and N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""tares""
- T: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)
- S: x (not in the word)

From this, we know:
- E is in the word and in the correct position: position 4 (since E is the 4th letter in ""tares"").
- T and S are not in the word.
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (because we got '-' for A at position 2).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (because we got '-' for R at position 3).

Now, combining all information:

Letters in the word: R, A, E (from first guess) and we confirmed E is in the word and now we know it's at position 4. Also, from the second guess, we know A and R are still in the word (since we got '-' for them) but in wrong positions.

Letters not in the word: C, N (from first guess), T, S (from second guess).

Positions:
- E is fixed at position 4: so the 4th letter is E.

For A:
- Not in position 3 (from first guess: crane had A at position 3 and got '-')
- Not in position 2 (from second guess: tares had A at position 2 and got '-')
- So A cannot be in position 2 or 3. Possible positions: 1 or 5? (since position 4 is taken by E)

For R:
- Not in position 2 (from first guess: crane had R at position 2 and got '-')
- Not in position 3 (from second guess: tares had R at position 3 and got '-')
- So R cannot be in position 2 or 3. Possible positions: 1 or 5? (position 4 is E, so not available)

But note: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 4 is E.

So for A and R, they must be in positions 1 and 5? But we have two letters and two positions? However, we don't know which one is where? And also, there is one more letter? Because the word has 5 letters: we have A, R, E, and two more letters? But we know E is at 4, so positions 1,2,3,5 are for the other letters? But we have A and R to place, and one more letter? Because we have three known letters: A, R, E? But the word has five letters? So there are two more letters we don't know? But we have eliminated C, N, T, S? So we need to find two more letters that are in the word.

We also know that from the feedback, we have:

- Position 1: we don't know? But we have tried C (not in word) and T (not in word). So the first letter is not C, T, and also not N? But we don't know what it is? Similarly, position 2: we had R (which is in word but not here) and A (in word but not here)? So position 2 is not R, not A? And we know it's not C, N, T, S? So we need to consider other letters.

Let's list the constraints:

Known letters in the word: A, R, E (with E at position 4)

Known letters not in the word: C, N, T, S

So the secret word has two more letters? Let's call them X and Y? They are from the remaining alphabet? Excluding A, R, E (which are in) and C, N, T, S (which are out)? And also excluding the known positions? But we don't know the positions of A and R? And we have to find X and Y.

Possible positions for the secret word:

Position 1: must be one of: A, R, or a new letter? But we know A and R are in the word? So position 1 could be A, R, or one of the unknown letters? Similarly for other positions.

But we have constraints:

- Position 1: cannot be C, N, T, S (known not in word). Also, if it were A, that's possible? But we don't know? Similarly for R.

But we have more constraints from the feedback:

For A: cannot be at position 2 or 3? So A must be at position 1 or 5? Because position 4 is E? So only positions 1 and 5 are available for A? Similarly for R: cannot be at position 2 or 3? So R must be at position 1 or 5? But positions 1 and 5 are only two positions? And we have two letters A and R? So they must occupy positions 1 and 5? But which one is which?

Also, position 2 and 3 must be filled by the two unknown letters? Because positions: 1,2,3,4,5? 4 is E? So 1,2,3,5? But 1 and 5 are taken by A and R? Then 2 and 3 must be the two unknown letters? But we have two unknown letters? So the word structure is:

Position 1: either A or R
Position 2: an unknown letter (not A, R, E? because E is at 4? But E is only once? We don't know if there are duplicates? But the feedback hasn't shown duplicates? So we assume no duplicates? Because if there were duplicates, the feedback might show multiple? But in Wordle, duplicates are possible? But in this case, we haven't seen any indication? So let's assume no duplicates for now? Unless forced.

But in the feedback, we have only one E? And it's at position 4? So if E were duplicated, we might have seen another '-'? But we didn't? So probably no duplicates? Similarly for A and R? So we assume all letters are distinct? For simplicity? But we should be cautious? However, the feedback for ""crane"" and ""tares"" didn't show any duplicate? So likely the word has distinct letters? So we'll assume that.

Therefore, the secret word has 5 distinct letters: A, R, E, and two others? Let's call them X and Y? And E is at position 4.

Now, positions:
- Position 1: either A or R? (since they must be at 1 or 5? and not 2,3)
- Position 5: the other of A or R? (if position 1 is A, then position 5 is R? or vice versa)
- Position 2: must be X? (one of the unknown letters)
- Position 3: must be Y? (the other unknown letter)

But we also have constraints from the feedback? Specifically, when we guessed ""crane"", we had R at position 2? And it was marked as '-'? Meaning R is in the word but not at position 2? Which we already used? Similarly, in ""tares"", we had A at position 2? And it was marked as '-'? So A is not at position 2? Which we also used? And R at position 3? Marked as '-'? So R not at 3? And A not at 3? From first guess? So position 2 and 3 are not for A or R? So they must be for the unknown letters? So that matches.

Now, what about the unknown letters? We know they are not C, N, T, S? And not A, R, E? So we need to choose from the remaining letters? But we have to form a valid English word.

Also, we have the feedback for the positions? For example, in ""crane"", we had E at position 5? And it was marked as '-'? Meaning E is in the word but not at position 5? But now we know E is at position 4? So that's consistent? Because position 5 is not E? So that's fine.

Now, for the next guess, we need to test the possibilities for positions 1 and 5? And also find the two unknown letters? But we have limited tries? So we should choose a word that can help us determine whether A is at position 1 or 5? And R at the other? And also test possible letters for positions 2 and 3.

But we don't know what the unknown letters are? So we need to cover common letters? But we have eliminated C, N, T, S? So the remaining common letters? Like L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

But we also have the constraint that the word must have E at position 4? And positions 1 and 5 are either A or R? So the word must be of the form:

Option 1: A _ _ E R
Option 2: R _ _ E A

And the two blanks are two unknown letters? Which are not C, N, T, S? And not A, R, E? (assuming distinct).

So we can think of words that fit these patterns? And use common letters? But we need to make a guess that will help us distinguish? And also get information about the unknown letters.

But we have two possibilities for the pattern? So we can choose a word that tests one of the patterns? Or we can choose a word that has common letters? But we must include E at position 4? And we must include either A or R at position 1 or 5? But we don't know which? So we might have to commit to one? Or we can choose a word that doesn't necessarily follow the pattern? But that might be less efficient? Because we know E is at 4? So we should keep that? And we know A and R are in the word? So we should include them? But in new positions? But the only new positions for A and R are 1 and 5? So we have to put them at 1 or 5? But we don't know which? So we can try one of the patterns? For example, try the pattern A _ _ E R? If we get feedback that A is at position 1? Or not? Similarly.

But we can also include common letters for the blanks? So let's list possible words for the two patterns:

Pattern 1: A _ _ E R
Possible words: ALTER? But T is not in the word? We know T is not in the word? So we cannot use T? Similarly, AGER? But that's 4 letters? Or AIDER? But that's 5? A-I-D-E-R? But D is possible? But let's see: AIDER? But we have E at 4? So A-I-D-E-R? Positions: A(1), I(2), D(3), E(4), R(5)? That fits the pattern? And I and D are not excluded? So it's possible? But is ""AIDER"" a word? Yes, meaning one who aids? Or more commonly ""aider"".

Similarly, other words: ALTER? But T is excluded? Not allowed? Because T is not in the word? So we cannot use T? Similarly, S is excluded? So no S? C, N, T, S are out? So for pattern A _ _ E R, we need two letters that are not C,N,T,S? And not A,R,E? So the blanks can be: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But we want common ones? Like L, I, D, etc.

Possible words: AIDER (A,I,D,E,R) -> I and D are new? And we can test? But we don't know if A is at position 1? Or R at position 5? So if we guess ""AIDER"", then:

- If the secret word is A _ _ E R, then we might get A(✓) and R(✓) if they are in the right positions? But we don't know? It might be that the word is R _ _ E A? So if we guess AIDER, and the word is R _ _ E A, then A at position 1 would be wrong? And R at position 5 would be wrong? So we get feedback that A is not at 1? And R is not at 5? Then we know the pattern must be R _ _ E A? And we can then guess accordingly? So that would be informative? But we use one guess to test the pattern? And then we know? But we have 4 guesses left? So it might be acceptable? But we can also try to cover more? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has the pattern but also tests common letters? But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has E at position 4? And includes A and R? But not necessarily at position 1 and 5? But we know that A and R must be at 1 or 5? Because they cannot be at 2 or 3? And position 4 is E? So they must be at 1 or 5? So we have to put them at 1 or 5? So we cannot avoid that? So we have to choose between the two patterns? Or we can choose a word that has one of the patterns? And use common letters for the blanks? 

But let's list possible words for pattern 1: A _ _ E R? With the two blanks being letters not in {C,N,T,S}? And not A,R,E? 

Possible words:
- AIDER: A,I,D,E,R -> I and D are new? And valid? 
- ALTER: but T is excluded? Not allowed? 
- AGER? 4 letters? 
- ABLER: A,B,L,E,R? But is ""ABLER"" a word? It's comparative of able? But usually ""abler""? Yes? But it's 5 letters? So A-B-L-E-R? But E is at position 4? So positions: A(1), B(2), L(3), E(4), R(5)? Yes? And B and L are not excluded? 
- ADZER? Not common? 
- AFIRE: A,F,I,R,E? But E is at position 5? But we need E at position 4? So not? 
- AGLET? T excluded? 
- AIDER and ABLER seem possible? 

For pattern 2: R _ _ E A? 
- RILED? R,I,L,E,D? But E is at position 4? So R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), D(5)? But we need A at position 5? But here D is at 5? Not A? 
- We need the word to end with A? So R _ _ E A? 
- RARER? But R repeated? And A at position 2? But we know A cannot be at position 2? And also, we assume distinct? So not? 
- RACER? But C excluded? 
- RAGER? R,A,G,E,R? R repeated? And A at position 2? But A cannot be at position 2? 
- RAPER? R,A,P,E,R? R repeated? 
- RATER? T excluded? 
- RAVER? R,A,V,E,R? R repeated? 
- RAVEN? N excluded? 
- RAYED? R,A,Y,E,D? But A at position 2? Not allowed? Because we know A cannot be at position 2? 
- So we need a word with R at 1, then two letters? Then E at 4? Then A at 5? And no repeated letters? And the two letters not C,N,T,S? 
- Possible: RIBEY? Not a word? 
- RICED? C excluded? 
- RIDGE? D and G? But E at position 5? Not 4? 
- RIFLE? E at 5? 
- RILEA? R,I,L,E,A? But E at position 4? So R(1), I(2), L(3), E(4), A(5)? Yes? And I and L are new? And not excluded? 
- Is ""RILEA"" a word? It might be a genus of grass? Or not common? But in Wordle, it might be accepted? 
- Other: RUPEE? But E repeated? And not ending with A? 
- RUSHA? Not common? 
- So ""RILEA"" might be a possibility? But let's see if there are better? 

But we don't know which pattern? So we need to test? 

Alternatively, we can make a guess that doesn't follow the pattern? But that might not be efficient? Because we know E is at 4? So we should keep that? And we know A and R are in the word? So we should include them? But if we put A and R in positions 1 and 5? Then we are testing one pattern? 

But we can also include new letters? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has the pattern but uses common letters? And then based on the feedback, we can determine the pattern? 

For example, guess ""AIDER"": 
- If the secret word is A _ _ E R, then we might get A(✓), I(?), D(?), E(✓), R(✓) if the letters match? But if not, we get feedback on I and D? 
- If the secret word is R _ _ E A, then we get A at position 1: since A is in the word but not at position 1? So we get '-' for A? And R at position 5: R is in the word but not at position 5? So we get '-' for R? And E is at 4? So we get E(✓)? And I and D: if they are in the word? Or not? 

But we don't know the unknown letters? So it might be messy? 

Perhaps we can choose a word that has the same pattern but with letters that are common? And then see which one fits? 

But we have to make a guess? 

Another thought: we have position 2 and 3 to fill? And we need to test letters? So we can choose a word that has common letters for position 2 and 3? And also tests the pattern? 

But let's list the possible words for both patterns? 

Pattern 1: A X Y E R? With X and Y not in {C,N,T,S,A,R,E}? 
Possible words: 
- AIDER: X=I, Y=D
- ABLER: X=B, Y=L
- AGLER? G and L? But E at 4? A-G-L-E-R? So X=G, Y=L? 
- AIDER, ABLER, AGLER? 

Pattern 2: R X Y E A? With X and Y not in {C,N,T,S,A,R,E}? 
Possible words: 
- RILEA: X=I, Y=L? R-I-L-E-A? 
- RICEA? C excluded? 
- RIFLE? But E at 5? 
- RIVEA? R-I-V-E-A? So X=I, Y=V? 
- Is ""RIVEA"" a word? Not common? 
- ROPED? P and D? But E at 4? R-O-P-E-D? But we need A at 5? 
- RUDER? D and E? But E repeated? 
- RULER? L and E? E repeated? 
- So few options? RILEA might be the only common one? Or not? 

But ""RILEA"" is not very common? 

Perhaps we can try a different approach? Instead of committing to the pattern, we can guess a word that has E at position 4? And includes A and R? But in positions that are not 1 or 5? But we know they cannot be at 2 or 3? So the only positions are 1 and 5? So we have to put them there? 

So we must choose one pattern? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the two unknown letters? But we don't know what they are? So we can use a word with common letters for position 2 and 3? And also have A and R at 1 and 5? 

But we have to choose which pattern? 

Let's try to guess ""AIDER"" for pattern 1? 

If we guess ""AIDER"": 
- If the secret word is A _ _ E R, then we might get some matches? 
- If not, then it must be pattern 2? 

But we have only 4 guesses left? So it's acceptable? 

But let's see the feedback we would get? 

Case 1: secret word is A X Y E R? 
- If X and Y are I and D? Then we get all correct? But unlikely? 
- If not, then for ""AIDER"": 
  - A at 1: if the secret word has A at 1, then ✓? 
  - I at 2: if the secret word has I at 2? Or if not, then if I is in the word but wrong position? Or not in word? 
  - D at 3: similarly? 
  - E at 4: ✓ 
  - R at 5: if secret word has R at 5, then ✓? 

Case 2: secret word is R X Y E A? 
- A at 1: but secret word has A at 5? So A is in the word but not at 1? So '-' for A? 
- I at 2: if I is in the word? Or not? 
- D at 3: similarly? 
- E at 4: ✓ 
- R at 5: but secret word has R at 1? So R is in the word but not at 5? So '-' for R? 

So in case 2, we get: A(-), I(?), D(?), E(✓), R(-) 

And we know that the pattern must be R _ _ E A? Because if A and R are not at 1 and 5 in this guess, then they must be at the other positions? 

So from the feedback, if we get A and R both with '-' in this guess, then we know the pattern is R _ _ E A? And we can then guess a word for that pattern? 

If we get A and R both with '✓', then it's pattern 1 and we might have the word? Or not? 

If we get mixed? For example, A✓ and R-? But that would be impossible? Because if A is at 1, then pattern 1? And R should be at 5? So if R is not at 5, then it's not pattern 1? But we have no other patterns? So it must be that if A is at 1, then R must be at 5? And vice versa? So mixed feedback shouldn't happen? 

Similarly, if A is not at 1, then R is not at 5? And pattern 2? 

So the feedback will tell us the pattern? 

Also, we get information about I and D? 

So ""AIDER"" seems a good guess? 

But we can also choose a word with more common letters? Like ""ABLER"" with B and L? 

But ""AIDER"" is fine? 

Another common word: ""LARGE""? But L and G? But we have E at 5? Not 4? And also, we know E is at 4? So we must have E at 4? 

So I think ""AIDER"" is a reasonable choice? 

But let's confirm the letters: A, I, D, E, R? 
- I and D are not excluded? 
- E is at position 4? 
- A at 1, R at 5? 

So we'll guess ""AIDER"". 

But we have to output the guess? 

Alternatively, to be safe, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to the pattern but still has E at 4 and includes A and R? But we have to put A and R in positions 1 or 5? Because they can't be elsewhere? 

So I think ""AIDER"" is fine. 

But let's see if there's a word that can test both patterns? But I don't think so? 

Another idea: guess a word that has the unknown letters? But we don't know? 

So I'll go with ""AIDER"". 

<guess>aider</guess>### Analysis of Feedback and Deductions

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-)  
  Meaning:  
  - C and N are **not** in the word.  
  - R, A, and E **are** in the word but in the wrong positions:  
    - R is not in position 2.  
    - A is not in position 3.  
    - E is not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: TARES**  
  Feedback: T(x), A(-), R(-), E(✓), S(x)  
  Meaning:  
  - T and S are **not** in the word.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - E is **correct** and in position 4.  

### Key Constraints
1. **Confirmed letters**:  
   - E is in the word and **fixed at position 4**.  
   - A and R are in the word but **not** in positions 2 or 3 (from both guesses).  
   - Since position 4 is taken by E, A and R must be in positions 1 or 5 (the only remaining spots).  

2. **Excluded letters**: C, N, T, S (cannot appear in the word).  

3. **Positional constraints**:  
   - Position 1: Cannot be C, N, T, S. Must be A or R.  
   - Position 2: Cannot be A (from TARES feedback), R (from CRANE feedback), C, N, T, S, or E (E is at 4). Must be a new letter.  
   - Position 3: Cannot be A (from CRANE), R (from TARES), C, N, T, S, or E. Must be a new letter.  
   - Position 4: E (fixed).  
   - Position 5: Cannot be E (from CRANE feedback). Must be A or R (whichever is not in position 1).  

4. **Word structure**:  
   The secret word must be one of two patterns:  
   - **Pattern 1**: `A _ _ E R` (A at 1, R at 5)  
   - **Pattern 2**: `R _ _ E A` (R at 1, A at 5)  
   The blanks (positions 2 and 3) must be filled with letters not in {A, R, E, C, N, T, S}.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- We need to test which pattern is correct (A at 1/R at 5 vs. R at 1/A at 5) while gathering information about the unknown letters in positions 2 and 3.  
- **Optimal approach**: Guess a word that fits **Pattern 1** (`A _ _ E R`) using common letters for positions 2 and 3. This will:  
  - Confirm or rule out Pattern 1.  
  - Provide feedback on the new letters in positions 2 and 3.  
- If Pattern 1 is incorrect, the word must be Pattern 2 (`R _ _ E A`), and we can adjust in the next guess.  
- We choose **AIDER** (A-I-D-E-R) because:  
  - It fits Pattern 1: A at 1, D at 3, E at 4, R at 5.  
  - Uses common letters (I and D) for positions 2 and 3.  
  - Avoids excluded letters (C, N, T, S).  

### Expected Feedback from AIDER
- If **Pattern 1 is correct** (secret word is `A _ _ E R`):  
  - A(✓) if A is at position 1.  
  - R(✓) if R is at position 5.  
  - Feedback on I (position 2) and D (position 3) will reveal if they are correct or in the word.  
- If **Pattern 2 is correct** (secret word is `R _ _ E A`):  
  - A(-) because A is at position 5, not 1.  
  - R(-) because R is at position 1, not 5.  
  - E(✓) remains fixed.  
  - Feedback on I and D will help identify the unknown letters.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the possibilities with minimal risk.",Guess 3: aider -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) I(✓) D(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
