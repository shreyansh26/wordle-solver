We are starting the game. We need to make an initial guess. Since the secret word is 5 letters long and we have no prior feedback, we should pick a word that maximizes the information gain. Typically, this includes using common letters and having as many distinct letters as possible.

Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""STARE"", etc. I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it has common letters: R, A, I, S, E.

However, note that the example in the instructions used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". But for a first guess, any valid word is acceptable.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

Thoughts:
- We haven't started so we have no feedback. Our goal is to get as much information as possible.
- The word ""RAISE"" uses common vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S). 

So, my first guess is: RAISE

I'm starting the game with no prior feedback, so I need an initial guess that maximizes information gain. The ideal first guess should:
- Use common English letters to cover frequent possibilities
- Include distinct letters to broaden coverage
- Prioritize vowels and high-frequency consonants

After analyzing common starting strategies:
- ""RAISE"" covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)
- It eliminates/reveals key letters in frequent positions
- It has no repeated letters for efficient feedback

This word will provide robust feedback about:
1. Presence of critical vowels (A, I, E)
2. Common starting consonants (R) and ending letters (S, E)
3. Middle-letter patterns

The word ""RAISE"" has been sent as the first guess. Here's the thought process:

We have five blank spaces to fill with no prior feedback. The goal is to cover frequently used letters in English to maximize the chances of getting informative feedback. The word ""RAISE"" includes:
- R (6th most common English letter)
- A (the most common vowel)
- I (another common vowel)
- S (the most common ending letter in English)
- E (the most common letter overall and second most common vowel)

It strategically places:
- Vowels A, I, E (covering 3 of the top 5 vowels)
- Consonants R and S (both top 8 consonants)
- All distinct letters (avolves feedback overlap)

The expected feedback will:
- Quickly narrow possible words
- Reveal positional information about key letters
- Identify vowel/consonant patterns early

We start with the feedback from Guess 1: raise -> R(-), A(-), I(x), S(-), E(x)
 This means:
 - R, A, S are present in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 1, 2, and 4 respectively).
 - I and E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since R, A, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 4, they must appear elsewhere.
 We know the secret word has R, A, S, and two other letters (not I, not E).

 We have 6 letters so far? Let's clarify: the word is 5 letters. We know:
 - It contains R, A, S.
 - It does not contain I or E.

 Therefore, the secret word has 5 letters: R, A, S, and two other letters (which are neither I nor E).

 Also, the positions:
 - R was guessed at position 1, but is not at position 1 -> so R must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5? But wait, our positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E.
 Since R is in the word but not position 1, it is in 2,3,4, or 5? However, we also have A at position 2 and S at position 4. But the feedback says A is not at position 2 and S not at position 4. So R cannot be at position 1, but also note:

 Positions available: 1 cannot have R, 2 cannot have A, 4 cannot have S? But that doesn't mean R cannot be at 2 or 4? Actually, the feedback doesn't say anything about the same letter multiple times. However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. For simplicity, let's assume no duplicates for now.

 But note: the feedback for each letter separately. We only know:
   R is present -> not at position 1.
   A is present -> not at position 2.
   S is present -> not at position 4.

 And from the absence: E and I are absent.

 So the word has R, A, S, and two other letters (which are not E or I).

 Now for our next guess, we have to avoid I and E. Also, we have to use R, A, S but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively? That is not entirely correct because the feedback says they are present but not in those positions. So we can try them in other positions.

 Since the word has these letters and they can't be at those positions, let's think about possible placements.

 Also, we have to use only 5-letter English words.

 What could the secret word be? We don't know. So for our next guess, we try to place R, A, S in spots where they are allowed and also consider that they cannot be in positions that we now know they are forbidden.

 Constraints for next guess:
 - Must include R, A, S (because they are in the word) unless we think there might be duplicates? How? The feedback does not reveal duplicates. If the word has two R's and we guessed one R which has a minus, then the other R might be elsewhere. But we don't know.

 Since we don't have evidence of duplicates, we'll assume the word uses each of R, A, S exactly once.

 Similarly, the other two letters must not be E or I.

 We can choose a word that uses R, A, S and two new letters to test? But we must also use the known information about positions.

 Let me map the positions we know:

 Position 1: cannot be R (but note: we don't know that for sure? Actually we know R isn't at position 1 because we got minus for R at position1. So R must be at one of 2,3,4,5? But note we have A and S also moving.

 However, position 2: we know A is not at position 2, but R might be? Similarly, position 4: S is not at position 4, but R might be? And A might be at position 4? Only unless excluded by letter constraints.

 So we can try:

 Our goal: eliminate positions and discover new letters.

 What are common 5-letter words that have R, A, S? And without E and I? And that do not put R at position1, A at position2, S at position4.

 Example words: 

 Let's look for words with R, A, S and without E, I.

 Possibilities: 
   Words that start with S? Because R cannot be at position1? But R is the only one we know and it cannot be at position1? Actually, R must be at 2,3,4, or 5.

 Because of our constraints, we must place:
   R: anywhere in 2,3,4,5.
   A: anywhere but 2? Actually, in the next guess, we can put A at 2? No, because we now know that position 2 is not A? The feedback says A is in the word but not at the position 2 we guessed. But if we put A at position 2 again, we'll get the same feedback? Or would the game let us get a minus again? Actually, yes because it's still present but wrong position? But we are allowed to reuse letters? We need to avoid using known bad positions for known letters? But we don't know the right position for A? So actually, we can try A in a new position? But note: we don't know if position 2 might become something else? Actually, we don't have information about constraints on other letters? So we can try.

 Alternatively, we might choose to move the known letters to different positions and introduce two new letters.

 But note: the previous guess had I and E which are excluded, so we avoid them.

 One candidate word: ""SAUCY"" -> contains S at position1, A at position2? But that would be bad because position2 is known to not have A? Actually, we know that A is in the word but not at position2, so we should try A at a different position? And S also we know is in the word but not at position4? So SAUCY: 
   Position1: S -> we don't know anything about S at position1? Actually, our previous guess had S at position4 and we know S is not at position4? So S in SAUCY is at position1: that is okay? Because we don't have information about S at position1? We only know S was at position4 and that was wrong? So S can be at any position except 4? Or we don't know? Actually, we know S is somewhere else? So S can be at position1,2,3,5? But position1? We haven't tested? So we can put S at position1? Similarly, A can be at position1?? No, because we have A? But we know A is not at position2? So A can be at position1? Only if we didn't rule it out? We didn't.

 Wait: in the first guess, we had positions:
   1: R -> minus (so R not at position1)
   2: A -> minus (so A not at position2)
   3: I -> absent -> so position3 is not I? But I is absent so we don't know what is at position3? It can be any other letter? But we know E is absent? And I is absent? So position3 must be something else.

 Similarly, position5: E -> absent -> so E is not there? So position5? We don't know.

 So for next guess, we want to:
   Place R, A, S in positions that we haven't eliminated? Specifically:
      R: positions 2,3,4,5 (but we don't know if they are available? We only know position1 is forbidden for R, the others are possible? But also we haven't tried?)
      A: positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding position2)
      S: positions 1,2,3,5 (avoiding position4)

 Why? Because we know that:
   - Position1: cannot be R, and nothing else? It can be A or S? Or other?
   - Position2: cannot be A? But can be R or S? Or other?
   - Position4: cannot be S? But can be A or R? Or other?

 Also, we don't know position3 and position5.

 We can try a word that has:
   Position1: try S? 
   Position2: since we know R is present and we haven't placed it? And we know R can be at position2? Why not?
   Position3: unknown? We can try A? Because A might be at position3? 
   Position4: avoid S? (so we won't use S at position4)
   Position5: we haven't tested? So we can put R? Or A? Or S? Actually, we have to place three letters: R, A, S? And also two more.

 But note: we don't know the entire word? So we must choose a word that includes R, A, S? But we don't know? Actually, we know they must be included.

 But wait: what if we don't put R at position2? Then we might discover it? We have flexibility.

 We want to get more information about positions? So we can put R in position2? Then A at position3? Then S at position5? Then positions1 and4 with new letters.

 Example: we can form ""CRASH"" but H is okay? But we don't know about C and H? Also, E is absent? So CRASH: no E or I? Okay? But wait, the word CRASH has S at position4? Which we know is forbidden? So S at position4? We cannot have that? Because the feedback said that S is not at position4? So what if we try to avoid S at position4?

 Alternatively, ""STARS""? But S twice? And we don't know? Also, E and I absent? But STARS has two S? And T, A, R? But we have:
   S at position1 and position5? 
   T is new? 
   A at position3? 
   R at position4? 

 But we know from the first guess that S is not at position4? So position4: R? That's okay? Because we haven't tested R at position4? And S is at position1? We haven't tested S at position1? So that's okay? But STARS has two S? So if the secret word has only one S? Then we might get feedback that the first S is in word but wrong position? And the last S? If the word doesn't have two S? Then we might have duplicate? So that complicates? We'll avoid duplicates? Or use a word without duplicates.

 We need a word without duplicates? And avoiding E and I? And having R, A, S.

 How about ""TRASH""? 
   T, R, A, S, H? 
   Positions: 
      1: T -> new letter
      2: R -> we can put R at position2? 
      3: A -> we can put A at position3? 
      4: S -> but we know S cannot be at position4? So that's bad? 
   So avoid: TRASH puts S at position4? Not allowed.

 How about ""SHARP""? 
   S, H, A, R, P? 
   Positions:
      1: S (allowed? because S wasn't at position1 in first guess? and we know S not at position4? but position1 is okay)
      2: H -> new
      3: A -> allowed? we haven't tested A at position3? 
      4: R -> new? wait, R: we know R is present? So we are moving it to position4? Okay? Because first guess R was at position1 and now at position4? That's okay? 
      5: P -> new

 But we haven't placed S at position1? And it has S at position1? And we know S is in the word? So okay? And A at position3? We haven't tested? And R at position4? We know R cannot be at position1? But position4? Okay? 

 But note: we already know that S cannot be at position4? We don't care? Because we are putting S at position1? And R at position4? That's fine? The issue is? 

 However, SHARP: 
   Letters: S, H, A, R, P -> includes R, A, S -> good. And no E or I -> good.

 We'll get feedback on:
   S at position1 -> could be correct? or not? If correct: ✓, else: - if present? Or x if not? But we know it is present? So we can get ✓ or -? 
   H -> if present? We don't know? 
   A at position3 -> if correct? Or if present? But we know A is present? So ✓ or -? 
   R at position4 -> we know R is present? So ✓ or -? 
   P -> if present? 

 This could give us more information? But we have to avoid? Actually, we don't have a constraint that R cannot be at position4? First guess was position1 for R -> which was wrong? So position4 is possible? Similarly, A can be at position3? 

 Alternatively, we can choose ""CARDS"" -> but S at position5? 
   C, A, R, D, S
   Position2: A? But we know that A cannot be at position2? So putting A at position2 would be a problem? Because we already know? So avoid? 

 So CARDS: 
   Position1: C
   Position2: A -> we know A is in the word? But we also know that position2 is not A? Why? Because from first guess: position2: A and got minus? So if we put A again at position2, we will get minus? Because it's present but wrong position? And we can get that feedback? But we already know? It doesn't give new information? 

 So it's better to put A not at position2? So SHARP moves A to position3? That might be good? Similarly, R is moved to position4? 

 But note: the secret word has A? And we know A isn't at position2? So we can try position1? Actually, let's see: we tried A only at position2? We don't know about other positions? For A, we can try position1? But SHARP has A at position3? So okay? 

 Another word: ""SPOON""? But doesn't have A? We must have A? So not that.

 We need words with A, R, S? 

 How about ""SCRAB""? Not common? 

 List? 
 ""TARNS""? But E is not present? Wait, TARNS: T,A,R,N,S -> good? 
   Positions: 
       1: T
       2: A -> but wait: we know position2 cannot be A? Because first guess said minus? 
       3: R 
       4: N? 
       5: S? 

 Putting A at position2 is a problem? Because we know A cannot be at position2? So if we do that, we'll know we get minus? So we avoid? 

 Let me try to avoid placing A at position2? And S at position4? And R at position1?

 One word: ""CRANS""? But S at position5? But position4? N? So okay? But CRANS? Not common? 

 Another: ""PAIRS""? But has I? which we know is absent? But PAIRS has I? So not? We avoid I? 

 How about ""MARSH"": M, A, R, S, H? 
   Position1: M -> new
   Position2: A -> we know A cannot be at position2? So bad? 

 How about ""ARSEL""? But E? And L? And has E? We know E is absent? 

 Another: ""SCARF""? 
   S at position1 -> okay? 
   C at position2 -> new? 
   A at position3 -> okay? (we haven't tested A at position3? And we know A isn't at position2? So position3 is allowed? 
   R at position4 -> okay? (we know R isn't at position1? But position4? We haven't tested? 
   F at position5 -> new? 
   But we have S at position1? R at position4? 
   Also, we are including A, R, S? 

 How about ""SCARF"": 
   S: position1 -> we haven't tested S at position1? 
   A: position3 -> we haven't tested A at position3? 
   R: position4 -> we haven't tested R at position4? 

 But wait: in the first guess we tested R at position1? But we haven't tested R at position4? So okay? 

 However, we know from first guess that S cannot be at position4? And here we are putting S at position1? That's fine? 

 Therefore, SCARF is a candidate? 

 But let's check common words? SCARF is a common word? Yes.

 Also, we avoid E and I? Yes.

 So let's use SCARF.

 But note: what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know? But SCARF has no duplicates? So that's safe? 

 Alternatively, we could use ""STARN""? Not common? 

 Better: ""SCARF"" or ""SCARD""? (which has D? same as SCARF? no, F vs D) 

 But SCARF is a word.

 So let's guess ""scarF"". Actually, in uppercase? But the output is fine? We'll use lowercase? 

 So our second guess: ""scarf""

 But note: we are taking a risk? We are putting A at position3? and R at position4? and S at position1? 

 We might get hits? Or not? Either way, it gives information? 

 We also introduce C and F? If they are absent? Then we know? So it helps? 

 Therefore, I choose ""scarf"".
</think>
Following the feedback from the first guess ""raise"" (R(-), A(-), I(x), S(-), E(x)), we know:
1. R, A, and S are in the secret word but **not** in positions 1, 2, or 4 respectively.
2. I and E are **not** in the secret word at all.
3. The secret word contains exactly R, A, S, and two other letters (excluding I and E).

For the next guess:
- Must include R, A, S
- Avoid positions where they are confirmed incorrect:  
  - R not at position 1  
  - A not at position 2  
  - S not at position 4
- Avoid letters I and E entirely  
- Introduce new letters to test for presence/position  

The word **""scarf""** fits these requirements:  
- Positions: S (position 1), C (new, position 2), A (position 3), R (position 4), F (new, position 5)  
- Places A at newly tested position 3 and R at position 4 (neither tested before)  
- Tests new consonants C and F  
- Avoids forbidden positions/letters  

This maximizes information by repositioning known letters and introducing new ones.

<guess>scarf</guess>",scarf,"We start with the feedback from Guess 1: raise -> R(-), A(-), I(x), S(-), E(x)
 This means:
 - R, A, S are present in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 1, 2, and 4 respectively).
 - I and E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since R, A, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 4, they must appear elsewhere.
 We know the secret word has R, A, S, and two other letters (not I, not E).

 We have 6 letters so far? Let's clarify: the word is 5 letters. We know:
 - It contains R, A, S.
 - It does not contain I or E.

 Therefore, the secret word has 5 letters: R, A, S, and two other letters (which are neither I nor E).

 Also, the positions:
 - R was guessed at position 1, but is not at position 1 -> so R must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5? But wait, our positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E.
 Since R is in the word but not position 1, it is in 2,3,4, or 5? However, we also have A at position 2 and S at position 4. But the feedback says A is not at position 2 and S not at position 4. So R cannot be at position 1, but also note:

 Positions available: 1 cannot have R, 2 cannot have A, 4 cannot have S? But that doesn't mean R cannot be at 2 or 4? Actually, the feedback doesn't say anything about the same letter multiple times. However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. For simplicity, let's assume no duplicates for now.

 But note: the feedback for each letter separately. We only know:
   R is present -> not at position 1.
   A is present -> not at position 2.
   S is present -> not at position 4.

 And from the absence: E and I are absent.

 So the word has R, A, S, and two other letters (which are not E or I).

 Now for our next guess, we have to avoid I and E. Also, we have to use R, A, S but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively? That is not entirely correct because the feedback says they are present but not in those positions. So we can try them in other positions.

 Since the word has these letters and they can't be at those positions, let's think about possible placements.

 Also, we have to use only 5-letter English words.

 What could the secret word be? We don't know. So for our next guess, we try to place R, A, S in spots where they are allowed and also consider that they cannot be in positions that we now know they are forbidden.

 Constraints for next guess:
 - Must include R, A, S (because they are in the word) unless we think there might be duplicates? How? The feedback does not reveal duplicates. If the word has two R's and we guessed one R which has a minus, then the other R might be elsewhere. But we don't know.

 Since we don't have evidence of duplicates, we'll assume the word uses each of R, A, S exactly once.

 Similarly, the other two letters must not be E or I.

 We can choose a word that uses R, A, S and two new letters to test? But we must also use the known information about positions.

 Let me map the positions we know:

 Position 1: cannot be R (but note: we don't know that for sure? Actually we know R isn't at position 1 because we got minus for R at position1. So R must be at one of 2,3,4,5? But note we have A and S also moving.

 However, position 2: we know A is not at position 2, but R might be? Similarly, position 4: S is not at position 4, but R might be? And A might be at position 4? Only unless excluded by letter constraints.

 So we can try:

 Our goal: eliminate positions and discover new letters.

 What are common 5-letter words that have R, A, S? And without E and I? And that do not put R at position1, A at position2, S at position4.

 Example words: 

 Let's look for words with R, A, S and without E, I.

 Possibilities: 
   Words that start with S? Because R cannot be at position1? But R is the only one we know and it cannot be at position1? Actually, R must be at 2,3,4, or 5.

 Because of our constraints, we must place:
   R: anywhere in 2,3,4,5.
   A: anywhere but 2? Actually, in the next guess, we can put A at 2? No, because we now know that position 2 is not A? The feedback says A is in the word but not at the position 2 we guessed. But if we put A at position 2 again, we'll get the same feedback? Or would the game let us get a minus again? Actually, yes because it's still present but wrong position? But we are allowed to reuse letters? We need to avoid using known bad positions for known letters? But we don't know the right position for A? So actually, we can try A in a new position? But note: we don't know if position 2 might become something else? Actually, we don't have information about constraints on other letters? So we can try.

 Alternatively, we might choose to move the known letters to different positions and introduce two new letters.

 But note: the previous guess had I and E which are excluded, so we avoid them.

 One candidate word: ""SAUCY"" -> contains S at position1, A at position2? But that would be bad because position2 is known to not have A? Actually, we know that A is in the word but not at position2, so we should try A at a different position? And S also we know is in the word but not at position4? So SAUCY: 
   Position1: S -> we don't know anything about S at position1? Actually, our previous guess had S at position4 and we know S is not at position4? So S in SAUCY is at position1: that is okay? Because we don't have information about S at position1? We only know S was at position4 and that was wrong? So S can be at any position except 4? Or we don't know? Actually, we know S is somewhere else? So S can be at position1,2,3,5? But position1? We haven't tested? So we can put S at position1? Similarly, A can be at position1?? No, because we have A? But we know A is not at position2? So A can be at position1? Only if we didn't rule it out? We didn't.

 Wait: in the first guess, we had positions:
   1: R -> minus (so R not at position1)
   2: A -> minus (so A not at position2)
   3: I -> absent -> so position3 is not I? But I is absent so we don't know what is at position3? It can be any other letter? But we know E is absent? And I is absent? So position3 must be something else.

 Similarly, position5: E -> absent -> so E is not there? So position5? We don't know.

 So for next guess, we want to:
   Place R, A, S in positions that we haven't eliminated? Specifically:
      R: positions 2,3,4,5 (but we don't know if they are available? We only know position1 is forbidden for R, the others are possible? But also we haven't tried?)
      A: positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding position2)
      S: positions 1,2,3,5 (avoiding position4)

 Why? Because we know that:
   - Position1: cannot be R, and nothing else? It can be A or S? Or other?
   - Position2: cannot be A? But can be R or S? Or other?
   - Position4: cannot be S? But can be A or R? Or other?

 Also, we don't know position3 and position5.

 We can try a word that has:
   Position1: try S? 
   Position2: since we know R is present and we haven't placed it? And we know R can be at position2? Why not?
   Position3: unknown? We can try A? Because A might be at position3? 
   Position4: avoid S? (so we won't use S at position4)
   Position5: we haven't tested? So we can put R? Or A? Or S? Actually, we have to place three letters: R, A, S? And also two more.

 But note: we don't know the entire word? So we must choose a word that includes R, A, S? But we don't know? Actually, we know they must be included.

 But wait: what if we don't put R at position2? Then we might discover it? We have flexibility.

 We want to get more information about positions? So we can put R in position2? Then A at position3? Then S at position5? Then positions1 and4 with new letters.

 Example: we can form ""CRASH"" but H is okay? But we don't know about C and H? Also, E is absent? So CRASH: no E or I? Okay? But wait, the word CRASH has S at position4? Which we know is forbidden? So S at position4? We cannot have that? Because the feedback said that S is not at position4? So what if we try to avoid S at position4?

 Alternatively, ""STARS""? But S twice? And we don't know? Also, E and I absent? But STARS has two S? And T, A, R? But we have:
   S at position1 and position5? 
   T is new? 
   A at position3? 
   R at position4? 

 But we know from the first guess that S is not at position4? So position4: R? That's okay? Because we haven't tested R at position4? And S is at position1? We haven't tested S at position1? So that's okay? But STARS has two S? So if the secret word has only one S? Then we might get feedback that the first S is in word but wrong position? And the last S? If the word doesn't have two S? Then we might have duplicate? So that complicates? We'll avoid duplicates? Or use a word without duplicates.

 We need a word without duplicates? And avoiding E and I? And having R, A, S.

 How about ""TRASH""? 
   T, R, A, S, H? 
   Positions: 
      1: T -> new letter
      2: R -> we can put R at position2? 
      3: A -> we can put A at position3? 
      4: S -> but we know S cannot be at position4? So that's bad? 
   So avoid: TRASH puts S at position4? Not allowed.

 How about ""SHARP""? 
   S, H, A, R, P? 
   Positions:
      1: S (allowed? because S wasn't at position1 in first guess? and we know S not at position4? but position1 is okay)
      2: H -> new
      3: A -> allowed? we haven't tested A at position3? 
      4: R -> new? wait, R: we know R is present? So we are moving it to position4? Okay? Because first guess R was at position1 and now at position4? That's okay? 
      5: P -> new

 But we haven't placed S at position1? And it has S at position1? And we know S is in the word? So okay? And A at position3? We haven't tested? And R at position4? We know R cannot be at position1? But position4? Okay? 

 But note: we already know that S cannot be at position4? We don't care? Because we are putting S at position1? And R at position4? That's fine? The issue is? 

 However, SHARP: 
   Letters: S, H, A, R, P -> includes R, A, S -> good. And no E or I -> good.

 We'll get feedback on:
   S at position1 -> could be correct? or not? If correct: ✓, else: - if present? Or x if not? But we know it is present? So we can get ✓ or -? 
   H -> if present? We don't know? 
   A at position3 -> if correct? Or if present? But we know A is present? So ✓ or -? 
   R at position4 -> we know R is present? So ✓ or -? 
   P -> if present? 

 This could give us more information? But we have to avoid? Actually, we don't have a constraint that R cannot be at position4? First guess was position1 for R -> which was wrong? So position4 is possible? Similarly, A can be at position3? 

 Alternatively, we can choose ""CARDS"" -> but S at position5? 
   C, A, R, D, S
   Position2: A? But we know that A cannot be at position2? So putting A at position2 would be a problem? Because we already know? So avoid? 

 So CARDS: 
   Position1: C
   Position2: A -> we know A is in the word? But we also know that position2 is not A? Why? Because from first guess: position2: A and got minus? So if we put A again at position2, we will get minus? Because it's present but wrong position? And we can get that feedback? But we already know? It doesn't give new information? 

 So it's better to put A not at position2? So SHARP moves A to position3? That might be good? Similarly, R is moved to position4? 

 But note: the secret word has A? And we know A isn't at position2? So we can try position1? Actually, let's see: we tried A only at position2? We don't know about other positions? For A, we can try position1? But SHARP has A at position3? So okay? 

 Another word: ""SPOON""? But doesn't have A? We must have A? So not that.

 We need words with A, R, S? 

 How about ""SCRAB""? Not common? 

 List? 
 ""TARNS""? But E is not present? Wait, TARNS: T,A,R,N,S -> good? 
   Positions: 
       1: T
       2: A -> but wait: we know position2 cannot be A? Because first guess said minus? 
       3: R 
       4: N? 
       5: S? 

 Putting A at position2 is a problem? Because we know A cannot be at position2? So if we do that, we'll know we get minus? So we avoid? 

 Let me try to avoid placing A at position2? And S at position4? And R at position1?

 One word: ""CRANS""? But S at position5? But position4? N? So okay? But CRANS? Not common? 

 Another: ""PAIRS""? But has I? which we know is absent? But PAIRS has I? So not? We avoid I? 

 How about ""MARSH"": M, A, R, S, H? 
   Position1: M -> new
   Position2: A -> we know A cannot be at position2? So bad? 

 How about ""ARSEL""? But E? And L? And has E? We know E is absent? 

 Another: ""SCARF""? 
   S at position1 -> okay? 
   C at position2 -> new? 
   A at position3 -> okay? (we haven't tested A at position3? And we know A isn't at position2? So position3 is allowed? 
   R at position4 -> okay? (we know R isn't at position1? But position4? We haven't tested? 
   F at position5 -> new? 
   But we have S at position1? R at position4? 
   Also, we are including A, R, S? 

 How about ""SCARF"": 
   S: position1 -> we haven't tested S at position1? 
   A: position3 -> we haven't tested A at position3? 
   R: position4 -> we haven't tested R at position4? 

 But wait: in the first guess we tested R at position1? But we haven't tested R at position4? So okay? 

 However, we know from first guess that S cannot be at position4? And here we are putting S at position1? That's fine? 

 Therefore, SCARF is a candidate? 

 But let's check common words? SCARF is a common word? Yes.

 Also, we avoid E and I? Yes.

 So let's use SCARF.

 But note: what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know? But SCARF has no duplicates? So that's safe? 

 Alternatively, we could use ""STARN""? Not common? 

 Better: ""SCARF"" or ""SCARD""? (which has D? same as SCARF? no, F vs D) 

 But SCARF is a word.

 So let's guess ""scarF"". Actually, in uppercase? But the output is fine? We'll use lowercase? 

 So our second guess: ""scarf""

 But note: we are taking a risk? We are putting A at position3? and R at position4? and S at position1? 

 We might get hits? Or not? Either way, it gives information? 

 We also introduce C and F? If they are absent? Then we know? So it helps? 

 Therefore, I choose ""scarf"".Following the feedback from the first guess ""raise"" (R(-), A(-), I(x), S(-), E(x)), we know:
1. R, A, and S are in the secret word but **not** in positions 1, 2, or 4 respectively.
2. I and E are **not** in the secret word at all.
3. The secret word contains exactly R, A, S, and two other letters (excluding I and E).

For the next guess:
- Must include R, A, S
- Avoid positions where they are confirmed incorrect:  
  - R not at position 1  
  - A not at position 2  
  - S not at position 4
- Avoid letters I and E entirely  
- Introduce new letters to test for presence/position  

The word **""scarf""** fits these requirements:  
- Positions: S (position 1), C (new, position 2), A (position 3), R (position 4), F (new, position 5)  
- Places A at newly tested position 3 and R at position 4 (neither tested before)  
- Tests new consonants C and F  
- Avoids forbidden positions/letters  

This maximizes information by repositioning known letters and introducing new ones.",Guess 2: scarf -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(✓) R(✓) F(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,SMART,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make an initial guess. Since the secret word is 5 letters long and we have no prior feedback, we should pick a word that maximizes the information gain. Typically, this includes using common letters and having as many distinct letters as possible.

Common starting words include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", ""STARE"", etc. I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it has common letters: R, A, I, S, E.

However, note that the example in the instructions used ""STORM"", ""BRAVE"", and ""BRISK"". But for a first guess, any valid word is acceptable.

I'll go with ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

Thoughts:
- We haven't started so we have no feedback. Our goal is to get as much information as possible.
- The word ""RAISE"" uses common vowels (A, I, E) and common consonants (R, S). 

So, my first guess is: RAISE

Formatting the response:I'm starting the game with no prior feedback, so I need an initial guess that maximizes information gain. The ideal first guess should:
- Use common English letters to cover frequent possibilities
- Include distinct letters to broaden coverage
- Prioritize vowels and high-frequency consonants

After analyzing common starting strategies:
- ""RAISE"" covers three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S)
- It eliminates/reveals key letters in frequent positions
- It has no repeated letters for efficient feedback

This word will provide robust feedback about:
1. Presence of critical vowels (A, I, E)
2. Common starting consonants (R) and ending letters (S, E)
3. Middle-letter patterns

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We start with the feedback from Guess 1: raise -> R(-), A(-), I(x), S(-), E(x)
 This means:
 - R, A, S are present in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 1, 2, and 4 respectively).
 - I and E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since R, A, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 4, they must appear elsewhere.
 We know the secret word has R, A, S, and two other letters (not I, not E).

 We have 6 letters so far? Let's clarify: the word is 5 letters. We know:
 - It contains R, A, S.
 - It does not contain I or E.

 Therefore, the secret word has 5 letters: R, A, S, and two other letters (which are neither I nor E).

 Also, the positions:
 - R was guessed at position 1, but is not at position 1 -> so R must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5? But wait, our positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E.
 Since R is in the word but not position 1, it is in 2,3,4, or 5? However, we also have A at position 2 and S at position 4. But the feedback says A is not at position 2 and S not at position 4. So R cannot be at position 1, but also note:

 Positions available: 1 cannot have R, 2 cannot have A, 4 cannot have S? But that doesn't mean R cannot be at 2 or 4? Actually, the feedback doesn't say anything about the same letter multiple times. However, we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. For simplicity, let's assume no duplicates for now.

 But note: the feedback for each letter separately. We only know:
   R is present -> not at position 1.
   A is present -> not at position 2.
   S is present -> not at position 4.

 And from the absence: E and I are absent.

 So the word has R, A, S, and two other letters (which are not E or I).

 Now for our next guess, we have to avoid I and E. Also, we have to use R, A, S but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively? That is not entirely correct because the feedback says they are present but not in those positions. So we can try them in other positions.

 Since the word has these letters and they can't be at those positions, let's think about possible placements.

 Also, we have to use only 5-letter English words.

 What could the secret word be? We don't know. So for our next guess, we try to place R, A, S in spots where they are allowed and also consider that they cannot be in positions that we now know they are forbidden.

 Constraints for next guess:
 - Must include R, A, S (because they are in the word) unless we think there might be duplicates? How? The feedback does not reveal duplicates. If the word has two R's and we guessed one R which has a minus, then the other R might be elsewhere. But we don't know.

 Since we don't have evidence of duplicates, we'll assume the word uses each of R, A, S exactly once.

 Similarly, the other two letters must not be E or I.

 We can choose a word that uses R, A, S and two new letters to test? But we must also use the known information about positions.

 Let me map the positions we know:

 Position 1: cannot be R (but note: we don't know that for sure? Actually we know R isn't at position 1 because we got minus for R at position1. So R must be at one of 2,3,4,5? But note we have A and S also moving.

 However, position 2: we know A is not at position 2, but R might be? Similarly, position 4: S is not at position 4, but R might be? And A might be at position 4? Only unless excluded by letter constraints.

 So we can try:

 Our goal: eliminate positions and discover new letters.

 What are common 5-letter words that have R, A, S? And without E and I? And that do not put R at position1, A at position2, S at position4.

 Example words: 

 Let's look for words with R, A, S and without E, I.

 Possibilities: 
   Words that start with S? Because R cannot be at position1? But R is the only one we know and it cannot be at position1? Actually, R must be at 2,3,4, or 5.

 Because of our constraints, we must place:
   R: anywhere in 2,3,4,5.
   A: anywhere but 2? Actually, in the next guess, we can put A at 2? No, because we now know that position 2 is not A? The feedback says A is in the word but not at the position 2 we guessed. But if we put A at position 2 again, we'll get the same feedback? Or would the game let us get a minus again? Actually, yes because it's still present but wrong position? But we are allowed to reuse letters? We need to avoid using known bad positions for known letters? But we don't know the right position for A? So actually, we can try A in a new position? But note: we don't know if position 2 might become something else? Actually, we don't have information about constraints on other letters? So we can try.

 Alternatively, we might choose to move the known letters to different positions and introduce two new letters.

 But note: the previous guess had I and E which are excluded, so we avoid them.

 One candidate word: ""SAUCY"" -> contains S at position1, A at position2? But that would be bad because position2 is known to not have A? Actually, we know that A is in the word but not at position2, so we should try A at a different position? And S also we know is in the word but not at position4? So SAUCY: 
   Position1: S -> we don't know anything about S at position1? Actually, our previous guess had S at position4 and we know S is not at position4? So S in SAUCY is at position1: that is okay? Because we don't have information about S at position1? We only know S was at position4 and that was wrong? So S can be at any position except 4? Or we don't know? Actually, we know S is somewhere else? So S can be at position1,2,3,5? But position1? We haven't tested? So we can put S at position1? Similarly, A can be at position1?? No, because we have A? But we know A is not at position2? So A can be at position1? Only if we didn't rule it out? We didn't.

 Wait: in the first guess, we had positions:
   1: R -> minus (so R not at position1)
   2: A -> minus (so A not at position2)
   3: I -> absent -> so position3 is not I? But I is absent so we don't know what is at position3? It can be any other letter? But we know E is absent? And I is absent? So position3 must be something else.

 Similarly, position5: E -> absent -> so E is not there? So position5? We don't know.

 So for next guess, we want to:
   Place R, A, S in positions that we haven't eliminated? Specifically:
      R: positions 2,3,4,5 (but we don't know if they are available? We only know position1 is forbidden for R, the others are possible? But also we haven't tried?)
      A: positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding position2)
      S: positions 1,2,3,5 (avoiding position4)

 Why? Because we know that:
   - Position1: cannot be R, and nothing else? It can be A or S? Or other?
   - Position2: cannot be A? But can be R or S? Or other?
   - Position4: cannot be S? But can be A or R? Or other?

 Also, we don't know position3 and position5.

 We can try a word that has:
   Position1: try S? 
   Position2: since we know R is present and we haven't placed it? And we know R can be at position2? Why not?
   Position3: unknown? We can try A? Because A might be at position3? 
   Position4: avoid S? (so we won't use S at position4)
   Position5: we haven't tested? So we can put R? Or A? Or S? Actually, we have to place three letters: R, A, S? And also two more.

 But note: we don't know the entire word? So we must choose a word that includes R, A, S? But we don't know? Actually, we know they must be included.

 But wait: what if we don't put R at position2? Then we might discover it? We have flexibility.

 We want to get more information about positions? So we can put R in position2? Then A at position3? Then S at position5? Then positions1 and4 with new letters.

 Example: we can form ""CRASH"" but H is okay? But we don't know about C and H? Also, E is absent? So CRASH: no E or I? Okay? But wait, the word CRASH has S at position4? Which we know is forbidden? So S at position4? We cannot have that? Because the feedback said that S is not at position4? So what if we try to avoid S at position4?

 Alternatively, ""STARS""? But S twice? And we don't know? Also, E and I absent? But STARS has two S? And T, A, R? But we have:
   S at position1 and position5? 
   T is new? 
   A at position3? 
   R at position4? 

 But we know from the first guess that S is not at position4? So position4: R? That's okay? Because we haven't tested R at position4? And S is at position1? We haven't tested S at position1? So that's okay? But STARS has two S? So if the secret word has only one S? Then we might get feedback that the first S is in word but wrong position? And the last S? If the word doesn't have two S? Then we might have duplicate? So that complicates? We'll avoid duplicates? Or use a word without duplicates.

 We need a word without duplicates? And avoiding E and I? And having R, A, S.

 How about ""TRASH""? 
   T, R, A, S, H? 
   Positions: 
      1: T -> new letter
      2: R -> we can put R at position2? 
      3: A -> we can put A at position3? 
      4: S -> but we know S cannot be at position4? So that's bad? 
   So avoid: TRASH puts S at position4? Not allowed.

 How about ""SHARP""? 
   S, H, A, R, P? 
   Positions:
      1: S (allowed? because S wasn't at position1 in first guess? and we know S not at position4? but position1 is okay)
      2: H -> new
      3: A -> allowed? we haven't tested A at position3? 
      4: R -> new? wait, R: we know R is present? So we are moving it to position4? Okay? Because first guess R was at position1 and now at position4? That's okay? 
      5: P -> new

 But we haven't placed S at position1? And it has S at position1? And we know S is in the word? So okay? And A at position3? We haven't tested? And R at position4? We know R cannot be at position1? But position4? Okay? 

 But note: we already know that S cannot be at position4? We don't care? Because we are putting S at position1? And R at position4? That's fine? The issue is? 

 However, SHARP: 
   Letters: S, H, A, R, P -> includes R, A, S -> good. And no E or I -> good.

 We'll get feedback on:
   S at position1 -> could be correct? or not? If correct: ✓, else: - if present? Or x if not? But we know it is present? So we can get ✓ or -? 
   H -> if present? We don't know? 
   A at position3 -> if correct? Or if present? But we know A is present? So ✓ or -? 
   R at position4 -> we know R is present? So ✓ or -? 
   P -> if present? 

 This could give us more information? But we have to avoid? Actually, we don't have a constraint that R cannot be at position4? First guess was position1 for R -> which was wrong? So position4 is possible? Similarly, A can be at position3? 

 Alternatively, we can choose ""CARDS"" -> but S at position5? 
   C, A, R, D, S
   Position2: A? But we know that A cannot be at position2? So putting A at position2 would be a problem? Because we already know? So avoid? 

 So CARDS: 
   Position1: C
   Position2: A -> we know A is in the word? But we also know that position2 is not A? Why? Because from first guess: position2: A and got minus? So if we put A again at position2, we will get minus? Because it's present but wrong position? And we can get that feedback? But we already know? It doesn't give new information? 

 So it's better to put A not at position2? So SHARP moves A to position3? That might be good? Similarly, R is moved to position4? 

 But note: the secret word has A? And we know A isn't at position2? So we can try position1? Actually, let's see: we tried A only at position2? We don't know about other positions? For A, we can try position1? But SHARP has A at position3? So okay? 

 Another word: ""SPOON""? But doesn't have A? We must have A? So not that.

 We need words with A, R, S? 

 How about ""SCRAB""? Not common? 

 List? 
 ""TARNS""? But E is not present? Wait, TARNS: T,A,R,N,S -> good? 
   Positions: 
       1: T
       2: A -> but wait: we know position2 cannot be A? Because first guess said minus? 
       3: R 
       4: N? 
       5: S? 

 Putting A at position2 is a problem? Because we know A cannot be at position2? So if we do that, we'll know we get minus? So we avoid? 

 Let me try to avoid placing A at position2? And S at position4? And R at position1?

 One word: ""CRANS""? But S at position5? But position4? N? So okay? But CRANS? Not common? 

 Another: ""PAIRS""? But has I? which we know is absent? But PAIRS has I? So not? We avoid I? 

 How about ""MARSH"": M, A, R, S, H? 
   Position1: M -> new
   Position2: A -> we know A cannot be at position2? So bad? 

 How about ""ARSEL""? But E? And L? And has E? We know E is absent? 

 Another: ""SCARF""? 
   S at position1 -> okay? 
   C at position2 -> new? 
   A at position3 -> okay? (we haven't tested A at position3? And we know A isn't at position2? So position3 is allowed? 
   R at position4 -> okay? (we know R isn't at position1? But position4? We haven't tested? 
   F at position5 -> new? 
   But we have S at position1? R at position4? 
   Also, we are including A, R, S? 

 How about ""SCARF"": 
   S: position1 -> we haven't tested S at position1? 
   A: position3 -> we haven't tested A at position3? 
   R: position4 -> we haven't tested R at position4? 

 But wait: in the first guess we tested R at position1? But we haven't tested R at position4? So okay? 

 However, we know from first guess that S cannot be at position4? And here we are putting S at position1? That's fine? 

 Therefore, SCARF is a candidate? 

 But let's check common words? SCARF is a common word? Yes.

 Also, we avoid E and I? Yes.

 So let's use SCARF.

 But note: what if the word has duplicate letters? We don't know? But SCARF has no duplicates? So that's safe? 

 Alternatively, we could use ""STARN""? Not common? 

 Better: ""SCARF"" or ""SCARD""? (which has D? same as SCARF? no, F vs D) 

 But SCARF is a word.

 So let's guess ""scarF"". Actually, in uppercase? But the output is fine? We'll use lowercase? 

 So our second guess: ""scarf""

 But note: we are taking a risk? We are putting A at position3? and R at position4? and S at position1? 

 We might get hits? Or not? Either way, it gives information? 

 We also introduce C and F? If they are absent? Then we know? So it helps? 

 Therefore, I choose ""scarf"".Following the feedback from the first guess ""raise"" (R(-), A(-), I(x), S(-), E(x)), we know:
1. R, A, and S are in the secret word but **not** in positions 1, 2, or 4 respectively.
2. I and E are **not** in the secret word at all.
3. The secret word contains exactly R, A, S, and two other letters (excluding I and E).

For the next guess:
- Must include R, A, S
- Avoid positions where they are confirmed incorrect:  
  - R not at position 1  
  - A not at position 2  
  - S not at position 4
- Avoid letters I and E entirely  
- Introduce new letters to test for presence/position  

The word **""scarf""** fits these requirements:  
- Positions: S (position 1), C (new, position 2), A (position 3), R (position 4), F (new, position 5)  
- Places A at newly tested position 3 and R at position 4 (neither tested before)  
- Tests new consonants C and F  
- Avoids forbidden positions/letters  

This maximizes information by repositioning known letters and introducing new ones.

Let\'s clarify: the word is 5 letters. We know:\n - It contains R, A, S.\n - It does not contain I or E.\n\n Therefore, the secret word has 5 letters: R, A, S, and two other letters (which are neither I nor E).\n\n Also, the positions:\n - R was guessed at position 1, but is not at position 1 -> so R must be in positions 2,3,4, or 5? But wait, our positions: 1:R, 2:A, 3:I, 4:S, 5:E.\n Since R is in the word but not position 1, it is in 2,3,4, or 5? However, we also have A at position 2 and S at position 4. But the feedback says A is not at position 2 and S not at position 4. So R cannot be at position 1, but also note:\n\n Positions available: 1 cannot have R, 2 cannot have A, 4 cannot have S? But that doesn\'t mean R cannot be at 2 or 4? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t say anything about the same letter multiple times. However, we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. For simplicity, let\'s assume no duplicates for now.\n\n But note: the feedback for each letter separately. We only know:\n   R is present -> not at position 1.\n   A is present -> not at position 2.\n   S is present -> not at position 4.\n\n And from the absence: E and I are absent.\n\n So the word has R, A, S, and two other letters (which are not E or I).\n\n Now for our next guess, we have to avoid I and E. Also, we have to use R, A, S but not in positions 1, 2, and 4 respectively? That is not entirely correct because the feedback says they are present but not in those positions. So we can try them in other positions.\n\n Since the word has these letters and they can\'t be at those positions, let\'s think about possible placements.\n\n Also, we have to use only 5-letter English words.\n\n What could the secret word be? We don\'t know. So for our next guess, we try to place R, A, S in spots where they are allowed and also consider that they cannot be in positions that we now know they are forbidden.\n\n Constraints for next guess:\n - Must include R, A, S (because they are in the word) unless we think there might be duplicates? How? The feedback does not reveal duplicates. If the word has two R\'s and we guessed one R which has a minus, then the other R might be elsewhere. But we don\'t know.\n\n Since we don\'t have evidence of duplicates, we\'ll assume the word uses each of R, A, S exactly once.\n\n Similarly, the other two letters must not be E or I.\n\n We can choose a word that uses R, A, S and two new letters to test? But we must also use the known information about positions.\n\n Let me map the positions we know:\n\n Position 1: cannot be R (but note: we don\'t know that for sure? Actually we know R isn\'t at position 1 because we got minus for R at position1. So R must be at one of 2,3,4,5? But note we have A and S also moving.\n\n However, position 2: we know A is not at position 2, but R might be? Similarly, position 4: S is not at position 4, but R might be? And A might be at position 4? Only unless excluded by letter constraints.\n\n So we can try:\n\n Our goal: eliminate positions and discover new letters.\n\n What are common 5-letter words that have R, A, S? And without E and I? And that do not put R at position1, A at position2, S at position4.\n\n Example words: \n\n Let\'s look for words with R, A, S and without E, I.\n\n Possibilities: \n   Words that start with S? Because R cannot be at position1? But R is the only one we know and it cannot be at position1? Actually, R must be at 2,3,4, or 5.\n\n Because of our constraints, we must place:\n   R: anywhere in 2,3,4,5.\n   A: anywhere but 2? Actually, in the next guess, we can put A at 2? No, because we now know that position 2 is not A? The feedback says A is in the word but not at the position 2 we guessed. But if we put A at position 2 again, we\'ll get the same feedback? Or would the game let us get a minus again? Actually, yes because it\'s still present but wrong position? But we are allowed to reuse letters? We need to avoid using known bad positions for known letters? But we don\'t know the right position for A? So actually, we can try A in a new position? But note: we don\'t know if position 2 might become something else? Actually, we don\'t have information about constraints on other letters? So we can try.\n\n Alternatively, we might choose to move the known letters to different positions and introduce two new letters.\n\n But note: the previous guess had I and E which are excluded, so we avoid them.\n\n One candidate word: ""SAUCY"" -> contains S at position1, A at position2? But that would be bad because position2 is known to not have A? Actually, we know that A is in the word but not at position2, so we should try A at a different position? And S also we know is in the word but not at position4? So SAUCY: \n   Position1: S -> we don\'t know anything about S at position1? Actually, our previous guess had S at position4 and we know S is not at position4? So S in SAUCY is at position1: that is okay? Because we don\'t have information about S at position1? We only know S was at position4 and that was wrong? So S can be at any position except 4? Or we don\'t know? Actually, we know S is somewhere else? So S can be at position1,2,3,5? But position1? We haven\'t tested? So we can put S at position1? Similarly, A can be at position1?? No, because we have A? But we know A is not at position2? So A can be at position1? Only if we didn\'t rule it out? We didn\'t.\n\n Wait: in the first guess, we had positions:\n   1: R -> minus (so R not at position1)\n   2: A -> minus (so A not at position2)\n   3: I -> absent -> so position3 is not I? But I is absent so we don\'t know what is at position3? It can be any other letter? But we know E is absent? And I is absent? So position3 must be something else.\n\n Similarly, position5: E -> absent -> so E is not there? So position5? We don\'t know.\n\n So for next guess, we want to:\n   Place R, A, S in positions that we haven\'t eliminated? Specifically:\n      R: positions 2,3,4,5 (but we don\'t know if they are available? We only know position1 is forbidden for R, the others are possible? But also we haven\'t tried?)\n      A: positions 1,3,4,5 (avoiding position2)\n      S: positions 1,2,3,5 (avoiding position4)\n\n Why? Because we know that:\n   - Position1: cannot be R, and nothing else? It can be A or S? Or other?\n   - Position2: cannot be A? But can be R or S? Or other?\n   - Position4: cannot be S? But can be A or R? Or other?\n\n Also, we don\'t know position3 and position5.\n\n We can try a word that has:\n   Position1: try S? \n   Position2: since we know R is present and we haven\'t placed it? And we know R can be at position2? Why not?\n   Position3: unknown? We can try A? Because A might be at position3? \n   Position4: avoid S? (so we won\'t use S at position4)\n   Position5: we haven\'t tested? So we can put R? Or A? Or S? Actually, we have to place three letters: R, A, S? And also two more.\n\n But note: we don\'t know the entire word? So we must choose a word that includes R, A, S? But we don\'t know? Actually, we know they must be included.\n\n But wait: what if we don\'t put R at position2? Then we might discover it? We have flexibility.\n\n We want to get more information about positions? So we can put R in position2? Then A at position3? Then S at position5? Then positions1 and4 with new letters.\n\n Example: we can form ""CRASH"" but H is okay? But we don\'t know about C and H? Also, E is absent? So CRASH: no E or I? Okay? But wait, the word CRASH has S at position4? Which we know is forbidden? So S at position4? We cannot have that? Because the feedback said that S is not at position4? So what if we try to avoid S at position4?\n\n Alternatively, ""STARS""? But S twice? And we don\'t know? Also, E and I absent? But STARS has two S? And T, A, R? But we have:\n   S at position1 and position5? \n   T is new? \n   A at position3? \n   R at position4? \n\n But we know from the first guess that S is not at position4? So position4: R? That\'s okay? Because we haven\'t tested R at position4? And S is at position1? We haven\'t tested S at position1? So that\'s okay? But STARS has two S? So if the secret word has only one S? Then we might get feedback that the first S is in word but wrong position? And the last S? If the word doesn\'t have two S? Then we might have duplicate? So that complicates? We\'ll avoid duplicates? Or use a word without duplicates.\n\n We need a word without duplicates? And avoiding E and I?

So that\'s bad? \n   So avoid: TRASH puts S at position4? Not allowed.\n\n How about ""SHARP""? \n   S, H, A, R, P? \n   Positions:\n      1: S (allowed? because S wasn\'t at position1 in first guess? and we know S not at position4? but position1 is okay)\n      2: H -> new\n      3: A -> allowed? we haven\'t tested A at position3? \n      4: R -> new? wait, R: we know R is present?

And it has S at position1? And we know S is in the word? So okay? And A at position3? We haven\'t tested? And R at position4? We know R cannot be at position1? But position4? Okay? \n\n But note: we already know that S cannot be at position4? We don\'t care? Because we are putting S at position1? And R at position4? That\'s fine?

We\'ll use lowercase? \n\n So our second guess: ""scarf""\n\n But note: we are taking a risk? We are putting A at position3? and R at position4? and S at position1? \n\n We might get hits? Or not?

So it helps? \n\n Therefore, I choose ""scarf"".Following the feedback from the first guess ""raise"" (R(-), A(-), I(x), S(-), E(x)), we know:\n1. R, A, and S are in the secret word but **not** in positions 1, 2, or 4 respectively.\n2. I and E are **not** in the secret word at all.\n3.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R(-): R is in the word but not at position 1.
- A(-): A is in the word but not at position 2.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(-): S is in the word but not at position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

Guess 2: ""scarf""
- S(✓): S is in the word and at position 1 (correct position).
- C(x): C is not in the word.
- A(✓): A is in the word and at position 3 (correct position).
- R(✓): R is in the word and at position 4 (correct position).
- F(x): F is not in the word.

From this, we can deduce:
1. The secret word has S at position 1, A at position 3, and R at position 4.
   - So the word pattern is: S _ A R _
2. We know the word contains S, A, R, and two other letters (since it's 5 letters).
3. We know that I, E, C, and F are not in the word (from the x's).
4. From guess 1, we also know that the word has R (but not at position 1, which is consistent with position 4 being correct), A (not at position 2, but now at position 3), and S (not at position 4, but now at position 1).

So the current known positions:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 2: unknown (but not A, because in guess1 A was at position2 and was wrong, and we haven't tested other letters there yet)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: R (fixed)
- Position 5: unknown

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with S, has A at position 3, R at position 4, and the second and fifth letters are unknown but must be letters that are not I, E, C, F (and also not S, A, R because we already have them? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates yet, so we assume no duplicates for now? But we must consider the possibility? However, the feedback doesn't show duplicates? So we'll avoid duplicates unless necessary.

But note: in the first guess, we had S at position4 and it was wrong? But now we have S at position1? So if the word had two S, we might have gotten a different feedback? But in guess1, S was at position4 and we got minus? That means there is an S but not at position4? It doesn't say how many? So it could be that there is only one S? Or more? But in guess2, we put S at position1 and got a check? So that S is correct? So if there were two S, we would have known? But we didn't get any additional minus for S? So probably only one S? Similarly for A and R? In guess1, A at position2 was minus? Now at position3 is check? So only one A? R at position1 was minus? Now at position4 is check? So only one R? So we can assume no duplicates? 

Therefore, the word has five distinct letters: S, A, R, and two others that are not I, E, C, F.

We need to fill position2 and position5.

What are possible letters for position2 and position5? They must be letters that are in the word? But we don't know? We have to guess? We can choose any word that fits the pattern and uses letters not excluded? And we want to test as many new letters as possible? But we have only two positions? So we can test two new letters? 

But note: we have only 6 guesses? We have used 2? So we have 4 left? We are close? Because we have three letters fixed? So we only need to find two letters? 

We can try to guess the word? But we need to be efficient? 

What are common words that fit S _ A R _ ?

Examples:
- ""smart"": but T? We haven't excluded T? But position2: M? and position5: T? 
- ""snarl"": N and L? 
- ""scare"": but E is excluded? 
- ""share"": E excluded? 
- ""spare"": E excluded? 
- ""stare"": E excluded? 
- ""swarm"": W and M? 
- ""shard"": H and D? 
- ""snark"": N and K? 
- ""spark"": P and K? 

But we must avoid E? So words like ""share"", ""spare"", ""stare"" are out? 

We also must avoid I, C, F? So we can use T, M, N, L, P, K, H, D, W, etc? 

But we want to maximize information? Since we have two positions? We can choose a word that uses two new letters? And if we get feedback? We might solve? 

But note: if we get a word that has the two letters? Then we can get checks? Or minuses? 

Alternatively, we can try to cover more letters? But we have only two positions? So we can only test two new letters? 

But we have many letters left? So we should choose common letters? 

Common consonants: T, N, L, P, etc? 

We can try ""smart"": 
   S, M, A, R, T? 
   Position2: M? 
   Position5: T? 

If we get feedback: 
   S: already correct? 
   M: if present? 
   A: correct? 
   R: correct? 
   T: if present? 

But if M is not in the word? We get x? Similarly for T? 

But if we get both M and T absent? Then we know the word must have two other letters? But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses one of the letters we are testing? But we have to? 

But note: we are trying to solve? 

Another idea: we can try a word that uses the same letter in both positions? But that would be duplicate? And we don't know? But we can? 

But let's avoid? 

We can list possible words? 

Possible words: 
- ""shark"": H and K? 
- ""snarl"": N and L? 
- ""spark"": P and K? 
- ""stark"": T and K? 
- ""swarm"": W and M? 
- ""scarp"": but C is excluded? 
- ""sharp"": but we already tried? And F? But we tried scarf? 

We haven't tried? 

But we know C and F are excluded? So avoid? 

So let's choose a word that uses common letters? 

I think ""smart"" is a good candidate? Because M and T are common? 

But we can also consider ""snarl"" or ""spark""? 

But let's see: we have to make a guess? 

We can also think: what letters are more common? 

But we have no information about position2 and position5? 

So we can try ""smart"". 

But note: in the first guess, we had no information about position2? We only know that A is not at position2? But we can put any other letter? 

So I'll go with ""smart"". 

But let's check: 
   S(✓) -> we know? 
   M -> new? 
   A(✓) -> we know? 
   R(✓) -> we know? 
   T -> new? 

If we get feedback: 
   If M is in the word? Then we get minus? But we don't know the position? But we are putting it at position2? 
   Similarly for T? 

But if the word is ""smart"", we win? 

But if not? Then we get information? 

Alternatively, we can try ""swarm"": 
   S, W, A, R, M? 
   Then position2: W? position5: M? 

But we don't know? 

I think ""smart"" is a common word? 

But let's see the feedback? 

We have to choose? 

Another word: ""shard"": H and D? 

But I think ""smart"" is fine? 

But note: we have to avoid E, I, C, F? So ""smart"" is okay? 

So I'll guess ""smart"". 

But wait: what if the word is ""snarl""? Then we don't get it? 

But we have more guesses? 

We can also consider: we have only two positions? So we can try to cover letters that are common? 

But we have to pick one? 

I think ""smart"" is a good choice? 

But let me see: the most common words? 

Common words with S_A R_ : 
- ""stare"" (but E excluded) 
- ""share"" (E excluded) 
- ""spare"" (E excluded) 
- ""scare"" (E and C? C is excluded) 
- ""snare"" (E excluded) 
- ""swear"" (E excluded) 
- ""spear"" (E excluded) 

So without E, we have: 
- ""smart"" 
- ""snarl"" 
- ""spark"" 
- ""stark"" 
- ""shark"" 
- ""swarm"" 
- ""scarp"" (but C excluded) 
- ""sharp"" (but we tried? No, we tried ""scarf"", not ""sharp"") 

""sharp"" has H and P? And we haven't excluded H or P? 

But we already have two guesses? We are making the third? 

But we can try ""sharp""? 

But in ""sharp"": 
   S, H, A, R, P? 
   Position1: S? 
   Position2: H? 
   Position3: A? 
   Position4: R? 
   Position5: P? 

But we know S, A, R are fixed? So we are testing H and P? 

But we already know that? 

But we haven't tried H and P? 

But we can? 

But we want to solve? 

I think we should try a word that might be the answer? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has many common letters? 

But we have only two positions? 

I think ""smart"" is a good choice? 

But let me see: we have excluded I, E, C, F? 

We can try ""stark"": T and K? 

But I think ""smart"" is more common? 

I'll go with ""smart"". 

So guess: smart

But note: we have to output in the format? 

But let's confirm: 
   We have S at 1 (correct), M at 2 (unknown), A at 3 (correct), R at 4 (correct), T at 5 (unknown). 

If the word is ""smart"", we win? 

If not? Then we get feedback on M and T? 

So it's good? 

Therefore, I choose ""smart"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""raise""** → R(-), A(-), I(x), S(-), E(x)  
  - R, A, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
  - I and E are **absent**.  

- **Guess 2: ""scarf""** → S(✓), C(x), A(✓), R(✓), F(x)  
  - S is **correct at position 1**.  
  - A is **correct at position 3**.  
  - R is **correct at position 4**.  
  - C and F are **absent**.  

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: **S _ A R _** (positions: 1=S, 3=A, 4=R).  
2. Only positions 2 and 5 are unknown.  
3. **Excluded letters**: I, E, C, F (cannot appear).  
4. **Confirmed letters**: S, A, R (must appear, with positions fixed).  
5. The word has **no duplicates** (based on feedback consistency).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to fill positions 2 and 5 with new letters to test for presence/absence.  
- Prioritize common consonants (e.g., T, N, L, M, P) to maximize information.  
- **""smart""** fits perfectly:  
  - Tests **M** (position 2) and **T** (position 5), both common and untested.  
  - Avoids excluded letters (I, E, C, F).  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on M/T will narrow possibilities (e.g., ""snarl"", ""spark"", ""shard"").  

<guess>smart</guess>",smart,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise""
- R(-): R is in the word but not at position 1.
- A(-): A is in the word but not at position 2.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(-): S is in the word but not at position 4.
- E(x): E is not in the word.

Guess 2: ""scarf""
- S(✓): S is in the word and at position 1 (correct position).
- C(x): C is not in the word.
- A(✓): A is in the word and at position 3 (correct position).
- R(✓): R is in the word and at position 4 (correct position).
- F(x): F is not in the word.

From this, we can deduce:
1. The secret word has S at position 1, A at position 3, and R at position 4.
   - So the word pattern is: S _ A R _
2. We know the word contains S, A, R, and two other letters (since it's 5 letters).
3. We know that I, E, C, and F are not in the word (from the x's).
4. From guess 1, we also know that the word has R (but not at position 1, which is consistent with position 4 being correct), A (not at position 2, but now at position 3), and S (not at position 4, but now at position 1).

So the current known positions:
- Position 1: S (fixed)
- Position 2: unknown (but not A, because in guess1 A was at position2 and was wrong, and we haven't tested other letters there yet)
- Position 3: A (fixed)
- Position 4: R (fixed)
- Position 5: unknown

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with S, has A at position 3, R at position 4, and the second and fifth letters are unknown but must be letters that are not I, E, C, F (and also not S, A, R because we already have them? But note: the word might have duplicate letters? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates yet, so we assume no duplicates for now? But we must consider the possibility? However, the feedback doesn't show duplicates? So we'll avoid duplicates unless necessary.

But note: in the first guess, we had S at position4 and it was wrong? But now we have S at position1? So if the word had two S, we might have gotten a different feedback?

So we can assume no duplicates? 

Therefore, the word has five distinct letters: S, A, R, and two others that are not I, E, C, F.

We need to fill position2 and position5.

What are possible letters for position2 and position5? They must be letters that are in the word? But we don't know? We have to guess? We can choose any word that fits the pattern and uses letters not excluded? And we want to test as many new letters as possible? But we have only two positions? So we can test two new letters?

But we can also consider ""snarl"" or ""spark""? 

But let's see: we have to make a guess?

Another word: ""shard"": H and D?

So I'll guess ""smart"".

- ""scare"" (E and C? C is excluded) 
- ""snare"" (E excluded) 
- ""swear"" (E excluded) 
- ""spear"" (E excluded) 

So without E, we have: 
- ""smart"" 
- ""snarl"" 
- ""spark"" 
- ""stark"" 
- ""shark"" 
- ""swarm"" 
- ""scarp"" (but C excluded) 
- ""sharp"" (but we tried? No, we tried ""scarf"", not ""sharp"") 

""sharp"" has H and P? And we haven't excluded H or P? 

But we already have two guesses? We are making the third? 

But we can try ""sharp""? 

But in ""sharp"": 
   S, H, A, R, P? 
   Position1: S? 
   Position2: H?

So it's good? 

Therefore, I choose ""smart"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

  - R, A, S are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 4.  
  - I and E are **absent**.

  - S is **correct at position 1**.  
  - A is **correct at position 3**.  
  - R is **correct at position 4**.  
  - C and F are **absent**.  

### Deductions:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: **S _ A R _** (positions: 1=S, 3=A, 4=R).  
2. Only positions 2 and 5 are unknown.  
3. **Excluded letters**: I, E, C, F (cannot appear).  
4. **Confirmed letters**: S, A, R (must appear, with positions fixed).

  - Avoids excluded letters (I, E, C, F).  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on M/T will narrow possibilities (e.g., ""snarl"", ""spark"", ""shard"").",Guess 3: smart -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) M(✓) A(✓) R(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
