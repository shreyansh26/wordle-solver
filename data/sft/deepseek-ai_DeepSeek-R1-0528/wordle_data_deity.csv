We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - Letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
   - Letter E is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"" it was the last letter).

 Important: The feedback for E is '-', meaning it is present but in the wrong position. Since E was in the 5th position, it must appear in one of the first four positions.

 So the secret word contains E, but not C, R, A, N. And E is not in the 5th position.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are absent)
   - Contains E (since E is present) and the E must not be in the last position (if we put it last, that would be incorrect, but we know it's not in the 5th position so avoid putting E at the end? Actually, the feedback only tells us that E is in the word and not at the position we guessed. We don't know exactly where it is, but we know it's not at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback symbol '-' means the letter is in the word but in a different position. So for E, since we placed it in position 5 and got '-', it must be in the word somewhere else (positions 1 to 4). 

 However, note: the feedback doesn't specify which positions are correct for E, only that it's misplaced. And importantly, we only know that E is not at position 5. But it could be at any of positions 1-4.

 Also, note: the entire feedback tells us that the word does not have C, R, A, N.

 Since E is the only letter that is present (and it's not in the 5th position), we must include E in our next guess and place it in positions 1-4.

 We also know that the word does not have C, R, A, N, so we must avoid those letters.

 Let's think of words that have E but not C, R, A, N.

 Also, we are making a second guess so we want to use a word with new letters to get more information.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Vowels: O, I, U are still available (since E is already in the word and A is absent). We know the word has at least one E.

 We want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Possible starting letters: We have to put E somewhere in positions 1-4.

 Example: 
   Words with E in position 1: e.g., ""EXXXY"" (but avoiding C,R,A,N)

 Let me think of words that start with E and don't have C,R,A,N.

 For example: 
   ""EIGHT"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""eight"" has 5 letters? No, ""eight"" is 5 letters: E-I-G-H-T. It doesn't contain C,R,A,N. But note: G and H and T are new.

 However, note: the word must be valid English words.

 Alternatively: 
   ""EXIST"": has X and S and T, but E is first -> but what about the E? We want to put E in a new position? Actually, in the previous guess E was in position 5, now we can put it in position 1? Yes, because we know E is not in position 5 in the secret word, so it could be in position 1.

 But note: we don't know where E is, so we can put E in any of the first four positions. We are trying to get information about other positions.

 However, we also have the constraint that the secret word has E in one of positions 1-4.

 We can also consider words where E is in the middle.

 Example words without C,R,A,N and with E:

   E in position 1: 
      elbow -> but has B, L, O, W (but E is first) -> however, we have to avoid R? No, R is absent so we cannot have R. And elbow has no R? elbow: E-L-B-O-W -> no C,R,A,N. So valid? Actually, note: A is in elbow? No, A is absent. So elbow is E, L, B, O, W -> all new letters? We haven't tried L,B,O,W.

   But let's check the feedback: we know the word has E, so we want to test new letters.

   We can also consider: 
      ""ENSUE"": E first? But E is first and then we have N? But N was absent in the first guess? Wait: in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got x, meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N. Therefore, ""ENSUE"" has N -> not allowed.

   We must avoid N? Because N is absent. So we cannot use N.

   Similarly, avoid C, R, A, N.

   So ""elbow"": E, L, B, O, W -> no C, R, A, N. And E is in position 1.

   That sounds good? But note: we don't know if E is in position 1 in the secret word. It might be elsewhere.

   Alternatively, we can put the E in a different position to see if it's in that position.

   For example, if we put E in position 2, then we might get:
      If the secret word has E in position 2, then we get ✓ for E? But we don't know. We want to cover multiple possibilities.

   However, since we have limited tries, we might use a word that has E but in a position we haven't tested. Since we only know that E is not in position 5, then we can test position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   But to maximize information, we might choose a word that has E in a position where we haven't tested? Actually, we haven't tested any of positions 1-4 for E? We only know position 5 is not E.

   However, we are free to put E in any of the first four. We want to get information about where E might be.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that still has E but also introduces more common letters.

   Other words: 
      ""WELSH"": E is in position 2 -> W, E, L, S, H -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes, and new letters: W,L,S,H.

      ""SPIEL"": E is in position 5? But wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5 in the secret word. So we must avoid putting E in position 5. Therefore, ""spiel"" would have E in position 5 -> that is not allowed? Actually, what does the feedback say? The feedback says E is present but not at the position we guessed (which was 5). Therefore, in the secret word E is in positions 1,2,3, or 4. If we guess a word with E in position 5, then:
          - If the secret word has E in one of 1-4, then we would get '-' for E again? But that would be the same feedback? And we already know E is not in 5. So we don't need to test position 5 anymore? Actually, we are required to make a valid guess, but if we put E in 5, we'd get '-' (if the secret word has E) because E is in a different position (and we know E is in the word). But we also know position 5 is wrong so we can avoid it? It's acceptable to put E in 5? The rules don't forbid it, but it would not be efficient because we already know E isn't at the end.

      However, to avoid using a slot inefficiently, we shouldn't put E in position 5 again because we know it won't be correct. Therefore, we will only put E in positions 1-4.

   So ""SPIEL"" has E in position 5 -> skip.

   Another word: ""MODEL"": E in position 4? M, O, D, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes? But note: we must avoid A? Yes. And R? Yes. So MODEL: M,O,D,E,L -> no C,R,A,N. And E is in position 4.

   Or ""BELOW"": E in position 2 -> B,E,L,O,W -> no C,R,A,N.

   Which one to choose? The goal is to test as many letters as possible. 

   We have 5 new letters: whatever we choose, we want to avoid already known absent letters and cover as many as possible.

   The letters used so far: C,R,A,N,E. We know E is present but we don't know the others.

   So we are going to use only letters from:
      B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E must be included)

   Also, the word must be valid.

   Let me think of words that include E and also common letters.

   Common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

   So a word like ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> introduces B, L, O, W and E. And E is moved to position 2.

   Another: ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E is in position 4? T-O-W-E-L -> positions:1:T,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:L -> no C,R,A,N. But note: we are introducing T,O,W,E,L.

   But note: we are forced to have E in the word, so we can't avoid that. We are also not repeating any absent letters.

   Alternatively, what about ""QUOTE""? But it has O, T, E -> but Q and T? Also, we don't know about Q.

   Another common word: ""MIDST"" -> lacks E? So invalid because we must include E.

   So we must have E.

   I'll choose ""BELOW"": because it places E in position 2 (which we haven't tested) and introduces common letters: B, L, O, W.

   But note: E could be in position 1? We don't know. By putting it in position 2, we can see if it moves.

   Alternatively, if we put E in position 1, we are testing if E is at the start. Similarly, position 2 tests if E is there.

   I think either is fine.

   Another candidate: we could use a word that has E and also two E's? But note: we don't know if the word has more than one E. However, the feedback didn't mention two E's? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E. And the feedback showed one E as misplaced. If the word had two E's, then one would have been noted? Actually, the rules: only one '-' for E? Actually, in Wordle-like, if there are two E's and we guess one and it's in a different position and the other we didn't guess? But here we only guessed one E. So if the word has two E's, we don't know until we guess two E's? The feedback only tells you for the letters you guess. Since we only guessed one E, and it was misplaced, then it is present at least once. If we guess two E's, then both would get feedback independently.

   However, since we don't know, we might stick to one E for now.

   After considering, I choose ""BELOW"". It's a common word and uses letters we haven't tried.

   So second guess: BELOW.

   We are going to submit ""below"".

   But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""below"" is a valid English word.

   Therefore, we guess BELOW.

   The expected format: <guess>BELOW</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, N are absent (x), so they can't be in the secret word.
- E is present but misplaced (-), meaning it's in the word but not in the 5th position (since ""crane"" had E in position 5).

For the next guess:
1. Must include E (since it's confirmed present).
2. E must be placed in positions 1-4 (as position 5 is ruled out).
3. Cannot include C, R, A, or N.
4. Should test new common letters to maximize information.

The word ""BELOW"" meets these criteria:
- Contains E in position 2 (a previously untested position).
- Uses new letters: B, L, O, W (all common consonants/vowels).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify the position of E and check for the presence of B, L, O, W.

<guess>below</guess>",BELOW,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - Letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.

   - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are absent)
   - Contains E (since E is present) and the E must not be in the last position (if we put it last, that would be incorrect, but we know it's not in the 5th position so avoid putting E at the end?

 We want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Possible starting letters: We have to put E somewhere in positions 1-4.

 Example: 
   Words with E in position 1: e.g., ""EXXXY"" (but avoiding C,R,A,N)

 Let me think of words that start with E and don't have C,R,A,N.

 For example: 
   ""EIGHT"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""eight"" has 5 letters? No, ""eight"" is 5 letters: E-I-G-H-T. It doesn't contain C,R,A,N. But note: G and H and T are new.

 However, note: the word must be valid English words.

 Alternatively: 
   ""EXIST"": has X and S and T, but E is first -> but what about the E? We want to put E in a new position? Actually, in the previous guess E was in position 5, now we can put it in position 1? Yes, because we know E is not in position 5 in the secret word, so it could be in position 1.

Actually, note: A is in elbow? No, A is absent. So elbow is E, L, B, O, W -> all new letters? We haven't tried L,B,O,W.

   But let's check the feedback: we know the word has E, so we want to test new letters.

   We can also consider: 
      ""ENSUE"": E first? But E is first and then we have N? But N was absent in the first guess? Wait: in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got x, meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N. Therefore, ""ENSUE"" has N -> not allowed.

   We must avoid N? Because N is absent. So we cannot use N.

   Similarly, avoid C, R, A, N.

   So ""elbow"": E, L, B, O, W -> no C, R, A, N. And E is in position 1.

   That sounds good? But note: we don't know if E is in position 1 in the secret word. It might be elsewhere.

   Alternatively, we can put the E in a different position to see if it's in that position.

   For example, if we put E in position 2, then we might get:

Actually, in Wordle-like, if there are two E's and we guess one and it's in a different position and the other we didn't guess? But here we only guessed one E. So if the word has two E's, we don't know until we guess two E's? The feedback only tells you for the letters you guess. Since we only guessed one E, and it was misplaced, then it is present at least once. If we guess two E's, then both would get feedback independently.

   However, since we don't know, we might stick to one E for now.

   After considering, I choose ""BELOW"". It's a common word and uses letters we haven't tried.

   So second guess: BELOW.

   We are going to submit ""below"".

   But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""below"" is a valid English word.

   Therefore, we guess BELOW.

   The expected format: <guess>BELOW</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, N are absent (x), so they can't be in the secret word.
- E is present but misplaced (-), meaning it's in the word but not in the 5th position (since ""crane"" had E in position 5).

For the next guess:
1. Must include E (since it's confirmed present).
2. E must be placed in positions 1-4 (as position 5 is ruled out).
3. Cannot include C, R, A, or N.
4. Should test new common letters to maximize information.

The word ""BELOW"" meets these criteria:
- Contains E in position 2 (a previously untested position).
- Uses new letters: B, L, O, W (all common consonants/vowels).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify the position of E and check for the presence of B, L, O, W.",Guess 2: BELOW -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,deity,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - Letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
   - Letter E is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"" it was the last letter).

 Important: The feedback for E is '-', meaning it is present but in the wrong position. Since E was in the 5th position, it must appear in one of the first four positions.

 So the secret word contains E, but not C, R, A, N. And E is not in the 5th position.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are absent)
   - Contains E (since E is present) and the E must not be in the last position (if we put it last, that would be incorrect, but we know it's not in the 5th position so avoid putting E at the end? Actually, the feedback only tells us that E is in the word and not at the position we guessed. We don't know exactly where it is, but we know it's not at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback symbol '-' means the letter is in the word but in a different position. So for E, since we placed it in position 5 and got '-', it must be in the word somewhere else (positions 1 to 4). 

 However, note: the feedback doesn't specify which positions are correct for E, only that it's misplaced. And importantly, we only know that E is not at position 5. But it could be at any of positions 1-4.

 Also, note: the entire feedback tells us that the word does not have C, R, A, N.

 Since E is the only letter that is present (and it's not in the 5th position), we must include E in our next guess and place it in positions 1-4.

 We also know that the word does not have C, R, A, N, so we must avoid those letters.

 Let's think of words that have E but not C, R, A, N.

 Also, we are making a second guess so we want to use a word with new letters to get more information.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Vowels: O, I, U are still available (since E is already in the word and A is absent). We know the word has at least one E.

 We want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Possible starting letters: We have to put E somewhere in positions 1-4.

 Example: 
   Words with E in position 1: e.g., ""EXXXY"" (but avoiding C,R,A,N)

 Let me think of words that start with E and don't have C,R,A,N.

 For example: 
   ""EIGHT"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""eight"" has 5 letters? No, ""eight"" is 5 letters: E-I-G-H-T. It doesn't contain C,R,A,N. But note: G and H and T are new.

 However, note: the word must be valid English words.

 Alternatively: 
   ""EXIST"": has X and S and T, but E is first -> but what about the E? We want to put E in a new position? Actually, in the previous guess E was in position 5, now we can put it in position 1? Yes, because we know E is not in position 5 in the secret word, so it could be in position 1.

 But note: we don't know where E is, so we can put E in any of the first four positions. We are trying to get information about other positions.

 However, we also have the constraint that the secret word has E in one of positions 1-4.

 We can also consider words where E is in the middle.

 Example words without C,R,A,N and with E:

   E in position 1: 
      elbow -> but has B, L, O, W (but E is first) -> however, we have to avoid R? No, R is absent so we cannot have R. And elbow has no R? elbow: E-L-B-O-W -> no C,R,A,N. So valid? Actually, note: A is in elbow? No, A is absent. So elbow is E, L, B, O, W -> all new letters? We haven't tried L,B,O,W.

   But let's check the feedback: we know the word has E, so we want to test new letters.

   We can also consider: 
      ""ENSUE"": E first? But E is first and then we have N? But N was absent in the first guess? Wait: in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got x, meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N. Therefore, ""ENSUE"" has N -> not allowed.

   We must avoid N? Because N is absent. So we cannot use N.

   Similarly, avoid C, R, A, N.

   So ""elbow"": E, L, B, O, W -> no C, R, A, N. And E is in position 1.

   That sounds good? But note: we don't know if E is in position 1 in the secret word. It might be elsewhere.

   Alternatively, we can put the E in a different position to see if it's in that position.

   For example, if we put E in position 2, then we might get:
      If the secret word has E in position 2, then we get ✓ for E? But we don't know. We want to cover multiple possibilities.

   However, since we have limited tries, we might use a word that has E but in a position we haven't tested. Since we only know that E is not in position 5, then we can test position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   But to maximize information, we might choose a word that has E in a position where we haven't tested? Actually, we haven't tested any of positions 1-4 for E? We only know position 5 is not E.

   However, we are free to put E in any of the first four. We want to get information about where E might be.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that still has E but also introduces more common letters.

   Other words: 
      ""WELSH"": E is in position 2 -> W, E, L, S, H -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes, and new letters: W,L,S,H.

      ""SPIEL"": E is in position 5? But wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5 in the secret word. So we must avoid putting E in position 5. Therefore, ""spiel"" would have E in position 5 -> that is not allowed? Actually, what does the feedback say? The feedback says E is present but not at the position we guessed (which was 5). Therefore, in the secret word E is in positions 1,2,3, or 4. If we guess a word with E in position 5, then:
          - If the secret word has E in one of 1-4, then we would get '-' for E again? But that would be the same feedback? And we already know E is not in 5. So we don't need to test position 5 anymore? Actually, we are required to make a valid guess, but if we put E in 5, we'd get '-' (if the secret word has E) because E is in a different position (and we know E is in the word). But we also know position 5 is wrong so we can avoid it? It's acceptable to put E in 5? The rules don't forbid it, but it would not be efficient because we already know E isn't at the end.

      However, to avoid using a slot inefficiently, we shouldn't put E in position 5 again because we know it won't be correct. Therefore, we will only put E in positions 1-4.

   So ""SPIEL"" has E in position 5 -> skip.

   Another word: ""MODEL"": E in position 4? M, O, D, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes? But note: we must avoid A? Yes. And R? Yes. So MODEL: M,O,D,E,L -> no C,R,A,N. And E is in position 4.

   Or ""BELOW"": E in position 2 -> B,E,L,O,W -> no C,R,A,N.

   Which one to choose? The goal is to test as many letters as possible. 

   We have 5 new letters: whatever we choose, we want to avoid already known absent letters and cover as many as possible.

   The letters used so far: C,R,A,N,E. We know E is present but we don't know the others.

   So we are going to use only letters from:
      B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E must be included)

   Also, the word must be valid.

   Let me think of words that include E and also common letters.

   Common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

   So a word like ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> introduces B, L, O, W and E. And E is moved to position 2.

   Another: ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E is in position 4? T-O-W-E-L -> positions:1:T,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:L -> no C,R,A,N. But note: we are introducing T,O,W,E,L.

   But note: we are forced to have E in the word, so we can't avoid that. We are also not repeating any absent letters.

   Alternatively, what about ""QUOTE""? But it has O, T, E -> but Q and T? Also, we don't know about Q.

   Another common word: ""MIDST"" -> lacks E? So invalid because we must include E.

   So we must have E.

   I'll choose ""BELOW"": because it places E in position 2 (which we haven't tested) and introduces common letters: B, L, O, W.

   But note: E could be in position 1? We don't know. By putting it in position 2, we can see if it moves.

   Alternatively, if we put E in position 1, we are testing if E is at the start. Similarly, position 2 tests if E is there.

   I think either is fine.

   Another candidate: we could use a word that has E and also two E's? But note: we don't know if the word has more than one E. However, the feedback didn't mention two E's? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E. And the feedback showed one E as misplaced. If the word had two E's, then one would have been noted? Actually, the rules: only one '-' for E? Actually, in Wordle-like, if there are two E's and we guess one and it's in a different position and the other we didn't guess? But here we only guessed one E. So if the word has two E's, we don't know until we guess two E's? The feedback only tells you for the letters you guess. Since we only guessed one E, and it was misplaced, then it is present at least once. If we guess two E's, then both would get feedback independently.

   However, since we don't know, we might stick to one E for now.

   After considering, I choose ""BELOW"". It's a common word and uses letters we haven't tried.

   So second guess: BELOW.

   We are going to submit ""below"".

   But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""below"" is a valid English word.

   Therefore, we guess BELOW.

   The expected format: <guess>BELOW</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, N are absent (x), so they can't be in the secret word.
- E is present but misplaced (-), meaning it's in the word but not in the 5th position (since ""crane"" had E in position 5).

For the next guess:
1. Must include E (since it's confirmed present).
2. E must be placed in positions 1-4 (as position 5 is ruled out).
3. Cannot include C, R, A, or N.
4. Should test new common letters to maximize information.

The word ""BELOW"" meets these criteria:
- Contains E in position 2 (a previously untested position).
- Uses new letters: B, L, O, W (all common consonants/vowels).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify the position of E and check for the presence of B, L, O, W.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: BELOW -> Feedback: B(x) E(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x)
Meaning:
- B, L, O, W are not in the word.
- E is not only present, but it is correctly placed in position 2 (since in BELOW, E is at position 2 and we got a ✓).

So, now we know:
- The secret word has E in position 2.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W.

We need to find a 5-letter word that has E in the second position and doesn't contain any of the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W.

Known: position 2 must be E, so the word is: _ E _ _ _

Available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but English letters).

We must consider that the word must be valid and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

The first guess had many vowels but missed, and now we know E is in the second position. The word likely has other vowels? But the word might have only one vowel? However, E is a vowel. There might be another vowel? Or sometimes Y.

But we have to avoid O and A, and include E.

Vowels left: I, U, and sometimes Y.

So the word pattern: ? E ? ? ?

We need to choose a next guess that uses remaining letters. We should avoid the excluded ones and include new letters to gather information.

For example, common remaining letters: S, T, D, M, P, etc.

Idea: use a word that starts with a consonant we haven't tried, then E (fixed), and then other new letters.

For instance: 
- Try words like: ""DEPTH"" -> but D,E,P,T,H? But note, E is fixed at position 2? Wait, in DEPTH, the E is at position 2? D-E-P-T-H -> yes, position 2 is E. However, note: we did not try D, P, T, H before? Yes, and avoid excluded? We must avoid C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W. So DEPTH: D, E, P, T, H -> all new letters? Yes.

But DEPTH is a word? Yes, depth.

Another possibility: ""SETUP"" -> S-E-T-U-P? But E at position 2? S is first, E second? SETUP has letters S,E,T,U,P -> avoid excluded? No S in exclusions? No? Exclusions are C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W. S is not excluded.

But SETUP: E is at position 2? Yes, SETUP -> S-E-T-U-P.

Similarly, ""METRO"" -> but O is excluded (in BELOW we got O(x)), so O is absent. Therefore, we cannot use O? Wait, in BELOW: O(x), meaning O is not in the word? Correct, so avoid O.

So METRO is invalid.

Other words: ""MEDIC"" -> C is excluded? C in the word? Also, N? Wait MEDIC: M,E,D,I,C? C is excluded? Yes, we cannot use C? Since guess1 had C(x). So MEDIC invalid.

Similarly, ""FETUS"": F,E,T,U,S? Avoid excluded? F not excluded? Yes, and E is at position 2? F-E-T-U-S? Letter positions: F(1),E(2),T(3),U(4),S(5). Avoid C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W? Yes, FETUS is a word.

But note: we already know E is at position 2, so we are confirming that? Actually, we are using E in position 2 again? But that's okay because we know it's fixed? Yes, it might help confirm but also we are testing new letters.

We could also consider ""TESTY"": T,E,S,T,Y. But E at position 2? T-E-S-T-Y? Avoid excluded? Yes? But we have two T's? Could be? Same as any.

But I think DEPTH, FETUS, SETUP are candidates.

Goal: to get information about other positions.

We must also remember: the first guess crane had E misplaced? Now it's fixed at position 2? The feedback only tells that in BELOW, E was correct? So in the secret word, position 2 is E.

Now, the word must contain E only at position 2? Or could there be another E? We don't know. There might be another E? But if we guess a word with two E's, we might see feedback for both? However, we haven't gotten information about double E. It's possible.

But to avoid complications, we may guess a word without an extra E? Or with an extra E to test? But let's stick to testing new letters.

Among the candidates: 
  DEPTH: letters D, P, T, H
  SETUP: S, T, U, P
  FETUS: F, T, U, S

Which letters are more common? S, T are both common? T appears in all? 

But note: U is a vowel? It might be present.

We also have to consider positions: the word might not have T? We don't know.

To maximize new letters: SETUP introduces S, T, U, P. 
DEPTH introduces D, P, T, H. H is less common? Maybe SETUP is better.

But FETUS: F, T, U, S? Also common.

But let me pick SETUP? Actually, I think SETUP might be good? It uses S, E, T, U, P? And E at position 2? Pattern: S E T U P.

Wait, SETUP: it spells SET-UP? But as a word, SETUP is an accepted? Yes.

Or maybe ""SETUP"" might be not considered? We'll stick to common words.

Another possibility: ""GEIST"" -> G,E,I,S,T? Avoid excluded? Yes. But E at position 2? G-E-I-S-T -> yes. But maybe less common? 

I think SETUP is fine.

But note: SETUP and FETUS both have U? Which is a vowel? It might be present? 

We know only E is confirmed? And A and O are excluded? So the secret word must have E and maybe other vowels: I or U or Y.

Perhaps we can test U? In SETUP, we put U at position 4? Then if U is in the word, we might get feedback.

Similarly for FETUS.

But let's choose SETUP because it has more common consonants.

Alternative: ""QUEST"" -> but U? Q? Does QUEST have E at position 2? QUEST -> Q-U-E-S-T? Then E is at position 3? Not 2? So wrong.

""JUMPS"" -> No E? 

So I choose SETUP? Or perhaps ""PETTY"": P-E-T-T-Y? E at 2? Avoid excluded? P,E,T,T,Y -> no excluded? But we are repeating T? T might be present? We don't know.

But SETUP doesn't repeat letters? Yes.

So SETUP: S,E,T,U,P -> five distinct letters? S,E,T,U,P? S and P? Distinct? Yes? And E at 2? Yes.

Therefore, guess: SETUP.

But note: SETUP? The word is spelled S-E-T-U-P? In Wordle, SETUP is accepted? I think so.

If we don't want U, we could try ""STEIN"": S,E,T,I,N? But N? Guess1 crane had N(x), so N is excluded? We cannot use N! Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W => N is excluded? In crane, N(x)? Yes, so STEIN is invalid? Avoid.

Another word: ""SPEED"": S,E,E,D? E at position 2, and two E's? But S,P,E,E,D? Then positions: S1, E2, E3, E4,D5? But we have E twice? Also, we know E is at 2? But could the word have more E's? It's possible? But SPEED? Avoid excluded? S,P,E,D -> E we know, and avoid O,A,B,L,N? Yes? But wait: in first guess, we had E(-) so at least one E? But now we know position2 E(✓)? If we guess SPEED? We might get E2 as ✓ and then E3 and E4? They could be also E? So feedback? But let's avoid complexity? But SETUP is better? Or FETUS? 

FETUS: F,E,T,U,S? Has U? 

Alternatively, since we know E is at 2, we can focus on common words with E in second position.

List: 
  LEVER? L excluded? L(x) in BELOW? L is excluded? BELOW:L(x), so yes? Avoid L.

  REPAY? R and A excluded? Avoid.

  BEADY? B and A excluded? Avoid.

  SEIZE? S,E,I,Z,E? Position 2 E? Pattern: S E I Z E? Avoid excluded? C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W? Avoid? S,E,I,Z,E? E repeats? But yes? Available? Except I and Z? But I haven't been ruled? Also? BELOW had O(x), etc.

  But SEIZE: S,E,I,Z,E? Positions: S1,E2,I3,Z4,E5? But we know E is at position 2? And also at position 5? But we got E(-) in crane? Meaning E was misplaced at position5? Now if the secret has E only at position2, then when we guess SEIZE? Position5 E would be absent? Or if the secret has two E's? However, let's check: if secret has E only at position2? Then in SEIZE, we would get E2 as ✓ (green) and E5 would be absent? But the letter E? Then for E5: since the secret word has only one E? Then E5 would be marked? How? It would be x? Because it's absent? Or if the secret has two E's? We don't know.

  But this might be too risky? Instead, we choose SETUP? Or FETUS? Or DEPTH?

I think FETUS? Or maybe ""TEETH"": T,E,E,T,H? E repeats? Avoid? 

But note: another word: ""DEITY""? D,E,I,T,Y? Avoid excluded? Yes? Pattern D E I T Y? E at 2? Yes? But Y? 

But we don't know.

Actually, since we know so many letters are absent, the list might be constrained? We should choose a word that covers new frequent letters.

Perhaps DEPTH is better? DEPTH: D,E,P,T,H? All new letters? And E at 2? Yes.

Similarly, SETUP has U? Which is a vowel? That might be useful.

I'll go with DEPTH? Because it has T? T is very common? And P? And D? And H? 

DEPTH: common word? Yes.

Set guess: DEPTH.

But let me confirm: The word DEPTH contains D,E,P,T,H? And E is at position2? Yes: positions: 1:D,2:E,3:P,4:T,5:H.

Avoid excluded? We haven't excluded D,P,T,H? Correct? 

Therefore, let us guess DEPTH.

Expected format: <guess>DEPTH</guess>

After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""), we learned that C, R, A, N are **absent** (x), and E is **present** but misplaced (-) (i.e., not in position 5).
- From Guess 2 (""BELOW""), we learned that B, L, O, W are **absent** (x), and E is **correctly placed (✓) in position 2**.

Key deductions:
- The secret word must have E in **position 2**.
- Letters C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W are completely ruled out.
- Therefore, the secret word pattern is: `_ E _ _ _` (where E occupies the second position).
- Remaining letters must come from the unused set: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Strategy for the next guess:
- Prioritize a word that places E in position 2 and uses new, common letters from the remaining set to maximize information gain.
- Avoid excluded letters (C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W).
- Aim for distinct letters where possible to test more potential candidates.

Chosen word: **DEPTH**
- **D**, **P**, **T**, and **H** are all untested letters.
- The word fits the pattern `_ E _ _ _` with E in position 2.
- ""DEPTH"" is a valid English word meaning the deepness of something.

This guess tests four new letters in key positions:
- Position 1: D
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: H

Feedback will help pinpoint correct letters/positions and further constrain possibilities.

<guess>DEPTH</guess>",DEPTH,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: BELOW -> Feedback: B(x) E(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x)
Meaning:
- B, L, O, W are not in the word.
- E is not only present, but it is correctly placed in position 2 (since in BELOW, E is at position 2 and we got a ✓).

So, now we know:
- The secret word has E in position 2.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W.

We need to find a 5-letter word that has E in the second position and doesn't contain any of the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W.

Known: position 2 must be E, so the word is: _ E _ _ _

Available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but English letters).

We need to choose a next guess that uses remaining letters. We should avoid the excluded ones and include new letters to gather information.

For example, common remaining letters: S, T, D, M, P, etc.

Idea: use a word that starts with a consonant we haven't tried, then E (fixed), and then other new letters.

For instance: 
- Try words like: ""DEPTH"" -> but D,E,P,T,H? But note, E is fixed at position 2? Wait, in DEPTH, the E is at position 2? D-E-P-T-H -> yes, position 2 is E. However, note: we did not try D, P, T, H before? Yes, and avoid excluded? We must avoid C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W. So DEPTH: D, E, P, T, H -> all new letters? Yes.

But DEPTH is a word? Yes, depth.

Another possibility: ""SETUP"" -> S-E-T-U-P? But E at position 2? S is first, E second? SETUP has letters S,E,T,U,P -> avoid excluded? No S in exclusions? No? Exclusions are C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W. S is not excluded.

But SETUP: E is at position 2? Yes, SETUP -> S-E-T-U-P.

Similarly, ""METRO"" -> but O is excluded (in BELOW we got O(x)), so O is absent. Therefore, we cannot use O? Wait, in BELOW: O(x), meaning O is not in the word? Correct, so avoid O.

So METRO is invalid.

Other words: ""MEDIC"" -> C is excluded? C in the word? Also, N? Wait MEDIC: M,E,D,I,C? C is excluded? Yes, we cannot use C? Since guess1 had C(x). So MEDIC invalid.

Similarly, ""FETUS"": F,E,T,U,S? Avoid excluded? F not excluded? Yes, and E is at position 2? F-E-T-U-S? Letter positions: F(1),E(2),T(3),U(4),S(5). Avoid C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W? Yes, FETUS is a word.

But note: we already know E is at position 2, so we are confirming that? Actually, we are using E in position 2 again? But that's okay because we know it's fixed? Yes, it might help confirm but also we are testing new letters.

We could also consider ""TESTY"": T,E,S,T,Y. But E at position 2? T-E-S-T-Y? Avoid excluded? Yes? But we have two T's? Could be? Same as any.

But I think DEPTH, FETUS, SETUP are candidates.

Goal: to get information about other positions.

We must also remember: the first guess crane had E misplaced? Now it's fixed at position 2? The feedback only tells that in BELOW, E was correct? So in the secret word, position 2 is E.

Now, the word must contain E only at position 2? Or could there be another E? We don't know. There might be another E? But if we guess a word with two E's, we might see feedback for both? However, we haven't gotten information about double E. It's possible.

Wait, SETUP: it spells SET-UP? But as a word, SETUP is an accepted? Yes.

Or maybe ""SETUP"" might be not considered? We'll stick to common words.

Another possibility: ""GEIST"" -> G,E,I,S,T? Avoid excluded? Yes. But E at position 2? G-E-I-S-T -> yes. But maybe less common? 

I think SETUP is fine.

But note: SETUP and FETUS both have U? Which is a vowel? It might be present? 

We know only E is confirmed? And A and O are excluded? So the secret word must have E and maybe other vowels: I or U or Y.

Perhaps we can test U? In SETUP, we put U at position 4? Then if U is in the word, we might get feedback.

Similarly for FETUS.

But let's choose SETUP because it has more common consonants.

Alternative: ""QUEST"" -> but U? Q? Does QUEST have E at position 2? QUEST -> Q-U-E-S-T? Then E is at position 3? Not 2? So wrong.

""JUMPS"" -> No E? 

So I choose SETUP? Or perhaps ""PETTY"": P-E-T-T-Y? E at 2? Avoid excluded? P,E,T,T,Y -> no excluded? But we are repeating T? T might be present? We don't know.

But SETUP doesn't repeat letters? Yes.

So SETUP: S,E,T,U,P -> five distinct letters? S,E,T,U,P? S and P? Distinct? Yes? And E at 2? Yes.

Therefore, guess: SETUP.

But note: SETUP? The word is spelled S-E-T-U-P? In Wordle, SETUP is accepted? I think so.

If we don't want U, we could try ""STEIN"": S,E,T,I,N? But N? Guess1 crane had N(x), so N is excluded? We cannot use N! Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W => N is excluded? In crane, N(x)? Yes, so STEIN is invalid? Avoid.

Another word: ""SPEED"": S,E,E,D? E at position 2, and two E's? But S,P,E,E,D? Then positions: S1, E2, E3, E4,D5? But we have E twice? Also, we know E is at 2? But could the word have more E's? It's possible? But SPEED? Avoid excluded? S,P,E,D -> E we know, and avoid O,A,B,L,N? Yes? But wait: in first guess, we had E(-) so at least one E? But now we know position2 E(✓)? If we guess SPEED? We might get E2 as ✓ and then E3 and E4? They could be also E? So feedback? But let's avoid complexity? But SETUP is better? Or FETUS? 

FETUS: F,E,T,U,S? Has U? 

Alternatively, since we know E is at 2, we can focus on common words with E in second position.

  REPAY? R and A excluded? Avoid.

  BEADY? B and A excluded? Avoid.

  But SEIZE: S,E,I,Z,E? Positions: S1,E2,I3,Z4,E5? But we know E is at position 2? And also at position 5? But we got E(-) in crane? Meaning E was misplaced at position5? Now if the secret has E only at position2, then when we guess SEIZE? Position5 E would be absent? Or if the secret has two E's? However, let's check: if secret has E only at position2? Then in SEIZE, we would get E2 as ✓ (green) and E5 would be absent? But the letter E? Then for E5: since the secret word has only one E? Then E5 would be marked? How? It would be x? Because it's absent? Or if the secret has two E's? We don't know.

  But this might be too risky? Instead, we choose SETUP? Or FETUS? Or DEPTH?

I think FETUS? Or maybe ""TEETH"": T,E,E,T,H? E repeats? Avoid? 

But note: another word: ""DEITY""? D,E,I,T,Y? Avoid excluded? Yes? Pattern D E I T Y? E at 2? Yes? But Y? 

But we don't know.

Actually, since we know so many letters are absent, the list might be constrained? We should choose a word that covers new frequent letters.

Perhaps DEPTH is better? DEPTH: D,E,P,T,H? All new letters? And E at 2? Yes.

Similarly, SETUP has U? Which is a vowel? That might be useful.

I'll go with DEPTH? Because it has T? T is very common? And P? And D? And H? 

DEPTH: common word? Yes.

Set guess: DEPTH.

But let me confirm: The word DEPTH contains D,E,P,T,H? And E is at position2? Yes: positions: 1:D,2:E,3:P,4:T,5:H.

Avoid excluded? We haven't excluded D,P,T,H? Correct? 

Therefore, let us guess DEPTH.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
 This means:
   - Letters C, R, A, N are not in the secret word at all.
   - Letter E is in the secret word but not in the last position (since in ""crane"" it was the last letter).

 Important: The feedback for E is '-', meaning it is present but in the wrong position. Since E was in the 5th position, it must appear in one of the first four positions.

 So the secret word contains E, but not C, R, A, N. And E is not in the 5th position.

 We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Does not contain C, R, A, N (because they are absent)
   - Contains E (since E is present) and the E must not be in the last position (if we put it last, that would be incorrect, but we know it's not in the 5th position so avoid putting E at the end? Actually, the feedback only tells us that E is in the word and not at the position we guessed. We don't know exactly where it is, but we know it's not at position 5 in the secret word? Actually, the feedback symbol '-' means the letter is in the word but in a different position. So for E, since we placed it in position 5 and got '-', it must be in the word somewhere else (positions 1 to 4). 

 However, note: the feedback doesn't specify which positions are correct for E, only that it's misplaced. And importantly, we only know that E is not at position 5. But it could be at any of positions 1-4.

 Also, note: the entire feedback tells us that the word does not have C, R, A, N.

 Since E is the only letter that is present (and it's not in the 5th position), we must include E in our next guess and place it in positions 1-4.

 We also know that the word does not have C, R, A, N, so we must avoid those letters.

 Let's think of words that have E but not C, R, A, N.

 Also, we are making a second guess so we want to use a word with new letters to get more information.

 Common consonants we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Vowels: O, I, U are still available (since E is already in the word and A is absent). We know the word has at least one E.

 We want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Possible starting letters: We have to put E somewhere in positions 1-4.

 Example: 
   Words with E in position 1: e.g., ""EXXXY"" (but avoiding C,R,A,N)

 Let me think of words that start with E and don't have C,R,A,N.

 For example: 
   ""EIGHT"" is 5 letters? Actually, ""eight"" has 5 letters? No, ""eight"" is 5 letters: E-I-G-H-T. It doesn't contain C,R,A,N. But note: G and H and T are new.

 However, note: the word must be valid English words.

 Alternatively: 
   ""EXIST"": has X and S and T, but E is first -> but what about the E? We want to put E in a new position? Actually, in the previous guess E was in position 5, now we can put it in position 1? Yes, because we know E is not in position 5 in the secret word, so it could be in position 1.

 But note: we don't know where E is, so we can put E in any of the first four positions. We are trying to get information about other positions.

 However, we also have the constraint that the secret word has E in one of positions 1-4.

 We can also consider words where E is in the middle.

 Example words without C,R,A,N and with E:

   E in position 1: 
      elbow -> but has B, L, O, W (but E is first) -> however, we have to avoid R? No, R is absent so we cannot have R. And elbow has no R? elbow: E-L-B-O-W -> no C,R,A,N. So valid? Actually, note: A is in elbow? No, A is absent. So elbow is E, L, B, O, W -> all new letters? We haven't tried L,B,O,W.

   But let's check the feedback: we know the word has E, so we want to test new letters.

   We can also consider: 
      ""ENSUE"": E first? But E is first and then we have N? But N was absent in the first guess? Wait: in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got x, meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N. Therefore, ""ENSUE"" has N -> not allowed.

   We must avoid N? Because N is absent. So we cannot use N.

   Similarly, avoid C, R, A, N.

   So ""elbow"": E, L, B, O, W -> no C, R, A, N. And E is in position 1.

   That sounds good? But note: we don't know if E is in position 1 in the secret word. It might be elsewhere.

   Alternatively, we can put the E in a different position to see if it's in that position.

   For example, if we put E in position 2, then we might get:
      If the secret word has E in position 2, then we get ✓ for E? But we don't know. We want to cover multiple possibilities.

   However, since we have limited tries, we might use a word that has E but in a position we haven't tested. Since we only know that E is not in position 5, then we can test position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   But to maximize information, we might choose a word that has E in a position where we haven't tested? Actually, we haven't tested any of positions 1-4 for E? We only know position 5 is not E.

   However, we are free to put E in any of the first four. We want to get information about where E might be.

   Alternatively, we can choose a word that still has E but also introduces more common letters.

   Other words: 
      ""WELSH"": E is in position 2 -> W, E, L, S, H -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes, and new letters: W,L,S,H.

      ""SPIEL"": E is in position 5? But wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5 in the secret word. So we must avoid putting E in position 5. Therefore, ""spiel"" would have E in position 5 -> that is not allowed? Actually, what does the feedback say? The feedback says E is present but not at the position we guessed (which was 5). Therefore, in the secret word E is in positions 1,2,3, or 4. If we guess a word with E in position 5, then:
          - If the secret word has E in one of 1-4, then we would get '-' for E again? But that would be the same feedback? And we already know E is not in 5. So we don't need to test position 5 anymore? Actually, we are required to make a valid guess, but if we put E in 5, we'd get '-' (if the secret word has E) because E is in a different position (and we know E is in the word). But we also know position 5 is wrong so we can avoid it? It's acceptable to put E in 5? The rules don't forbid it, but it would not be efficient because we already know E isn't at the end.

      However, to avoid using a slot inefficiently, we shouldn't put E in position 5 again because we know it won't be correct. Therefore, we will only put E in positions 1-4.

   So ""SPIEL"" has E in position 5 -> skip.

   Another word: ""MODEL"": E in position 4? M, O, D, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes? But note: we must avoid A? Yes. And R? Yes. So MODEL: M,O,D,E,L -> no C,R,A,N. And E is in position 4.

   Or ""BELOW"": E in position 2 -> B,E,L,O,W -> no C,R,A,N.

   Which one to choose? The goal is to test as many letters as possible. 

   We have 5 new letters: whatever we choose, we want to avoid already known absent letters and cover as many as possible.

   The letters used so far: C,R,A,N,E. We know E is present but we don't know the others.

   So we are going to use only letters from:
      B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E must be included)

   Also, the word must be valid.

   Let me think of words that include E and also common letters.

   Common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

   So a word like ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> introduces B, L, O, W and E. And E is moved to position 2.

   Another: ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E is in position 4? T-O-W-E-L -> positions:1:T,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:L -> no C,R,A,N. But note: we are introducing T,O,W,E,L.

   But note: we are forced to have E in the word, so we can't avoid that. We are also not repeating any absent letters.

   Alternatively, what about ""QUOTE""? But it has O, T, E -> but Q and T? Also, we don't know about Q.

   Another common word: ""MIDST"" -> lacks E? So invalid because we must include E.

   So we must have E.

   I'll choose ""BELOW"": because it places E in position 2 (which we haven't tested) and introduces common letters: B, L, O, W.

   But note: E could be in position 1? We don't know. By putting it in position 2, we can see if it moves.

   Alternatively, if we put E in position 1, we are testing if E is at the start. Similarly, position 2 tests if E is there.

   I think either is fine.

   Another candidate: we could use a word that has E and also two E's? But note: we don't know if the word has more than one E. However, the feedback didn't mention two E's? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E. And the feedback showed one E as misplaced. If the word had two E's, then one would have been noted? Actually, the rules: only one '-' for E? Actually, in Wordle-like, if there are two E's and we guess one and it's in a different position and the other we didn't guess? But here we only guessed one E. So if the word has two E's, we don't know until we guess two E's? The feedback only tells you for the letters you guess. Since we only guessed one E, and it was misplaced, then it is present at least once. If we guess two E's, then both would get feedback independently.

   However, since we don't know, we might stick to one E for now.

   After considering, I choose ""BELOW"". It's a common word and uses letters we haven't tried.

   So second guess: BELOW.

   We are going to submit ""below"".

   But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""below"" is a valid English word.

   Therefore, we guess BELOW.

   The expected format: <guess>BELOW</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, N are absent (x), so they can't be in the secret word.
- E is present but misplaced (-), meaning it's in the word but not in the 5th position (since ""crane"" had E in position 5).

For the next guess:
1. Must include E (since it's confirmed present).
2. E must be placed in positions 1-4 (as position 5 is ruled out).
3. Cannot include C, R, A, or N.
4. Should test new common letters to maximize information.

The word ""BELOW"" meets these criteria:
- Contains E in position 2 (a previously untested position).
- Uses new letters: B, L, O, W (all common consonants/vowels).
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).
- Is a valid 5-letter English word.

This guess will help identify the position of E and check for the presence of B, L, O, W.

<guess>BELOW</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BELOW -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: BELOW -> Feedback: B(x) E(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x)
Meaning:
- B, L, O, W are not in the word.
- E is not only present, but it is correctly placed in position 2 (since in BELOW, E is at position 2 and we got a ✓).

So, now we know:
- The secret word has E in position 2.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W.

We need to find a 5-letter word that has E in the second position and doesn't contain any of the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W.

Known: position 2 must be E, so the word is: _ E _ _ _

Available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but English letters).

We must consider that the word must be valid and we want to test as many new letters as possible.

The first guess had many vowels but missed, and now we know E is in the second position. The word likely has other vowels? But the word might have only one vowel? However, E is a vowel. There might be another vowel? Or sometimes Y.

But we have to avoid O and A, and include E.

Vowels left: I, U, and sometimes Y.

So the word pattern: ? E ? ? ?

We need to choose a next guess that uses remaining letters. We should avoid the excluded ones and include new letters to gather information.

For example, common remaining letters: S, T, D, M, P, etc.

Idea: use a word that starts with a consonant we haven't tried, then E (fixed), and then other new letters.

For instance: 
- Try words like: ""DEPTH"" -> but D,E,P,T,H? But note, E is fixed at position 2? Wait, in DEPTH, the E is at position 2? D-E-P-T-H -> yes, position 2 is E. However, note: we did not try D, P, T, H before? Yes, and avoid excluded? We must avoid C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W. So DEPTH: D, E, P, T, H -> all new letters? Yes.

But DEPTH is a word? Yes, depth.

Another possibility: ""SETUP"" -> S-E-T-U-P? But E at position 2? S is first, E second? SETUP has letters S,E,T,U,P -> avoid excluded? No S in exclusions? No? Exclusions are C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W. S is not excluded.

But SETUP: E is at position 2? Yes, SETUP -> S-E-T-U-P.

Similarly, ""METRO"" -> but O is excluded (in BELOW we got O(x)), so O is absent. Therefore, we cannot use O? Wait, in BELOW: O(x), meaning O is not in the word? Correct, so avoid O.

So METRO is invalid.

Other words: ""MEDIC"" -> C is excluded? C in the word? Also, N? Wait MEDIC: M,E,D,I,C? C is excluded? Yes, we cannot use C? Since guess1 had C(x). So MEDIC invalid.

Similarly, ""FETUS"": F,E,T,U,S? Avoid excluded? F not excluded? Yes, and E is at position 2? F-E-T-U-S? Letter positions: F(1),E(2),T(3),U(4),S(5). Avoid C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W? Yes, FETUS is a word.

But note: we already know E is at position 2, so we are confirming that? Actually, we are using E in position 2 again? But that's okay because we know it's fixed? Yes, it might help confirm but also we are testing new letters.

We could also consider ""TESTY"": T,E,S,T,Y. But E at position 2? T-E-S-T-Y? Avoid excluded? Yes? But we have two T's? Could be? Same as any.

But I think DEPTH, FETUS, SETUP are candidates.

Goal: to get information about other positions.

We must also remember: the first guess crane had E misplaced? Now it's fixed at position 2? The feedback only tells that in BELOW, E was correct? So in the secret word, position 2 is E.

Now, the word must contain E only at position 2? Or could there be another E? We don't know. There might be another E? But if we guess a word with two E's, we might see feedback for both? However, we haven't gotten information about double E. It's possible.

But to avoid complications, we may guess a word without an extra E? Or with an extra E to test? But let's stick to testing new letters.

Among the candidates: 
  DEPTH: letters D, P, T, H
  SETUP: S, T, U, P
  FETUS: F, T, U, S

Which letters are more common? S, T are both common? T appears in all? 

But note: U is a vowel? It might be present.

We also have to consider positions: the word might not have T? We don't know.

To maximize new letters: SETUP introduces S, T, U, P. 
DEPTH introduces D, P, T, H. H is less common? Maybe SETUP is better.

But FETUS: F, T, U, S? Also common.

But let me pick SETUP? Actually, I think SETUP might be good? It uses S, E, T, U, P? And E at position 2? Pattern: S E T U P.

Wait, SETUP: it spells SET-UP? But as a word, SETUP is an accepted? Yes.

Or maybe ""SETUP"" might be not considered? We'll stick to common words.

Another possibility: ""GEIST"" -> G,E,I,S,T? Avoid excluded? Yes. But E at position 2? G-E-I-S-T -> yes. But maybe less common? 

I think SETUP is fine.

But note: SETUP and FETUS both have U? Which is a vowel? It might be present? 

We know only E is confirmed? And A and O are excluded? So the secret word must have E and maybe other vowels: I or U or Y.

Perhaps we can test U? In SETUP, we put U at position 4? Then if U is in the word, we might get feedback.

Similarly for FETUS.

But let's choose SETUP because it has more common consonants.

Alternative: ""QUEST"" -> but U? Q? Does QUEST have E at position 2? QUEST -> Q-U-E-S-T? Then E is at position 3? Not 2? So wrong.

""JUMPS"" -> No E? 

So I choose SETUP? Or perhaps ""PETTY"": P-E-T-T-Y? E at 2? Avoid excluded? P,E,T,T,Y -> no excluded? But we are repeating T? T might be present? We don't know.

But SETUP doesn't repeat letters? Yes.

So SETUP: S,E,T,U,P -> five distinct letters? S,E,T,U,P? S and P? Distinct? Yes? And E at 2? Yes.

Therefore, guess: SETUP.

But note: SETUP? The word is spelled S-E-T-U-P? In Wordle, SETUP is accepted? I think so.

If we don't want U, we could try ""STEIN"": S,E,T,I,N? But N? Guess1 crane had N(x), so N is excluded? We cannot use N! Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W => N is excluded? In crane, N(x)? Yes, so STEIN is invalid? Avoid.

Another word: ""SPEED"": S,E,E,D? E at position 2, and two E's? But S,P,E,E,D? Then positions: S1, E2, E3, E4,D5? But we have E twice? Also, we know E is at 2? But could the word have more E's? It's possible? But SPEED? Avoid excluded? S,P,E,D -> E we know, and avoid O,A,B,L,N? Yes? But wait: in first guess, we had E(-) so at least one E? But now we know position2 E(✓)? If we guess SPEED? We might get E2 as ✓ and then E3 and E4? They could be also E? So feedback? But let's avoid complexity? But SETUP is better? Or FETUS? 

FETUS: F,E,T,U,S? Has U? 

Alternatively, since we know E is at 2, we can focus on common words with E in second position.

List: 
  LEVER? L excluded? L(x) in BELOW? L is excluded? BELOW:L(x), so yes? Avoid L.

  REPAY? R and A excluded? Avoid.

  BEADY? B and A excluded? Avoid.

  SEIZE? S,E,I,Z,E? Position 2 E? Pattern: S E I Z E? Avoid excluded? C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W? Avoid? S,E,I,Z,E? E repeats? But yes? Available? Except I and Z? But I haven't been ruled? Also? BELOW had O(x), etc.

  But SEIZE: S,E,I,Z,E? Positions: S1,E2,I3,Z4,E5? But we know E is at position 2? And also at position 5? But we got E(-) in crane? Meaning E was misplaced at position5? Now if the secret has E only at position2, then when we guess SEIZE? Position5 E would be absent? Or if the secret has two E's? However, let's check: if secret has E only at position2? Then in SEIZE, we would get E2 as ✓ (green) and E5 would be absent? But the letter E? Then for E5: since the secret word has only one E? Then E5 would be marked? How? It would be x? Because it's absent? Or if the secret has two E's? We don't know.

  But this might be too risky? Instead, we choose SETUP? Or FETUS? Or DEPTH?

I think FETUS? Or maybe ""TEETH"": T,E,E,T,H? E repeats? Avoid? 

But note: another word: ""DEITY""? D,E,I,T,Y? Avoid excluded? Yes? Pattern D E I T Y? E at 2? Yes? But Y? 

But we don't know.

Actually, since we know so many letters are absent, the list might be constrained? We should choose a word that covers new frequent letters.

Perhaps DEPTH is better? DEPTH: D,E,P,T,H? All new letters? And E at 2? Yes.

Similarly, SETUP has U? Which is a vowel? That might be useful.

I'll go with DEPTH? Because it has T? T is very common? And P? And D? And H? 

DEPTH: common word? Yes.

Set guess: DEPTH.

But let me confirm: The word DEPTH contains D,E,P,T,H? And E is at position2? Yes: positions: 1:D,2:E,3:P,4:T,5:H.

Avoid excluded? We haven't excluded D,P,T,H? Correct? 

Therefore, let us guess DEPTH.

Expected format: <guess>DEPTH</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 (""crane""), we learned that C, R, A, N are **absent** (x), and E is **present** but misplaced (-) (i.e., not in position 5).
- From Guess 2 (""BELOW""), we learned that B, L, O, W are **absent** (x), and E is **correctly placed (✓) in position 2**.

Key deductions:
- The secret word must have E in **position 2**.
- Letters C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W are completely ruled out.
- Therefore, the secret word pattern is: `_ E _ _ _` (where E occupies the second position).
- Remaining letters must come from the unused set: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Strategy for the next guess:
- Prioritize a word that places E in position 2 and uses new, common letters from the remaining set to maximize information gain.
- Avoid excluded letters (C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W).
- Aim for distinct letters where possible to test more potential candidates.

Chosen word: **DEPTH**
- **D**, **P**, **T**, and **H** are all untested letters.
- The word fits the pattern `_ E _ _ _` with E in position 2.
- ""DEPTH"" is a valid English word meaning the deepness of something.

This guess tests four new letters in key positions:
- Position 1: D
- Position 3: P
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: H

Feedback will help pinpoint correct letters/positions and further constrain possibilities.

We are trying to get information about other positions.\n\n However, we also have the constraint that the secret word has E in one of positions 1-4.\n\n We can also consider words where E is in the middle.\n\n Example words without C,R,A,N and with E:\n\n   E in position 1: \n      elbow -> but has B, L, O, W (but E is first) -> however, we have to avoid R? No, R is absent so we cannot have R. And elbow has no R? elbow: E-L-B-O-W -> no C,R,A,N. So valid? Actually, note: A is in elbow? No, A is absent. So elbow is E, L, B, O, W -> all new letters? We haven\'t tried L,B,O,W.\n\n   But let\'s check the feedback: we know the word has E, so we want to test new letters.\n\n   We can also consider: \n      ""ENSUE"": E first? But E is first and then we have N? But N was absent in the first guess? Wait: in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got x, meaning N is not in the word. So we cannot use N. Therefore, ""ENSUE"" has N -> not allowed.\n\n   We must avoid N? Because N is absent. So we cannot use N.\n\n   Similarly, avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n   So ""elbow"": E, L, B, O, W -> no C, R, A, N. And E is in position 1.\n\n   That sounds good? But note: we don\'t know if E is in position 1 in the secret word. It might be elsewhere.\n\n   Alternatively, we can put the E in a different position to see if it\'s in that position.\n\n   For example, if we put E in position 2, then we might get:\n      If the secret word has E in position 2, then we get ✓ for E? But we don\'t know. We want to cover multiple possibilities.\n\n   However, since we have limited tries, we might use a word that has E but in a position we haven\'t tested. Since we only know that E is not in position 5, then we can test position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n   But to maximize information, we might choose a word that has E in a position where we haven\'t tested? Actually, we haven\'t tested any of positions 1-4 for E? We only know position 5 is not E.\n\n   However, we are free to put E in any of the first four. We want to get information about where E might be.\n\n   Alternatively, we can choose a word that still has E but also introduces more common letters.\n\n   Other words: \n      ""WELSH"": E is in position 2 -> W, E, L, S, H -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes, and new letters: W,L,S,H.\n\n      ""SPIEL"": E is in position 5? But wait, we cannot put E in position 5 because we know E is not in position 5 in the secret word. So we must avoid putting E in position 5. Therefore, ""spiel"" would have E in position 5 -> that is not allowed? Actually, what does the feedback say? The feedback says E is present but not at the position we guessed (which was 5). Therefore, in the secret word E is in positions 1,2,3, or 4. If we guess a word with E in position 5, then:\n          - If the secret word has E in one of 1-4, then we would get \'-\' for E again? But that would be the same feedback? And we already know E is not in 5. So we don\'t need to test position 5 anymore? Actually, we are required to make a valid guess, but if we put E in 5, we\'d get \'-\' (if the secret word has E) because E is in a different position (and we know E is in the word). But we also know position 5 is wrong so we can avoid it? It\'s acceptable to put E in 5? The rules don\'t forbid it, but it would not be efficient because we already know E isn\'t at the end.\n\n      However, to avoid using a slot inefficiently, we shouldn\'t put E in position 5 again because we know it won\'t be correct. Therefore, we will only put E in positions 1-4.\n\n   So ""SPIEL"" has E in position 5 -> skip.\n\n   Another word: ""MODEL"": E in position 4? M, O, D, E, L -> avoids C,R,A,N? Yes? But note: we must avoid A? Yes. And R? Yes. So MODEL: M,O,D,E,L -> no C,R,A,N. And E is in position 4.\n\n   Or ""BELOW"": E in position 2 -> B,E,L,O,W -> no C,R,A,N.\n\n   Which one to choose? The goal is to test as many letters as possible. \n\n   We have 5 new letters: whatever we choose, we want to avoid already known absent letters and cover as many as possible.\n\n   The letters used so far: C,R,A,N,E. We know E is present but we don\'t know the others.\n\n   So we are going to use only letters from:\n      B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and E must be included)\n\n   Also, the word must be valid.\n\n   Let me think of words that include E and also common letters.\n\n   Common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\n   So a word like ""BELOW"": B, E, L, O, W -> introduces B, L, O, W and E. And E is moved to position 2.\n\n   Another: ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> E is in position 4? T-O-W-E-L -> positions:1:T,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:L -> no C,R,A,N. But note: we are introducing T,O,W,E,L.\n\n   But note: we are forced to have E in the word, so we can\'t avoid that. We are also not repeating any absent letters.\n\n   Alternatively, what about ""QUOTE""? But it has O, T, E -> but Q and T? Also, we don\'t know about Q.\n\n   Another common word: ""MIDST"" -> lacks E? So invalid because we must include E.\n\n   So we must have E.\n\n   I\'ll choose ""BELOW"": because it places E in position 2 (which we haven\'t tested) and introduces common letters: B, L, O, W.\n\n   But note: E could be in position 1? We don\'t know. By putting it in position 2, we can see if it moves.\n\n   Alternatively, if we put E in position 1, we are testing if E is at the start. Similarly, position 2 tests if E is there.\n\n   I think either is fine.\n\n   Another candidate: we could use a word that has E and also two E\'s? But note: we don\'t know if the word has more than one E. However, the feedback didn\'t mention two E\'s? Actually, in the first guess, we had only one E. And the feedback showed one E as misplaced. If the word had two E\'s, then one would have been noted? Actually, the rules: only one \'-\' for E? Actually, in Wordle-like, if there are two E\'s and we guess one and it\'s in a different position and the other we didn\'t guess? But here we only guessed one E. So if the word has two E\'s, we don\'t know until we guess two E\'s? The feedback only tells you for the letters you guess. Since we only guessed one E, and it was misplaced, then it is present at least once. If we guess two E\'s, then both would get feedback independently.\n\n   However, since we don\'t know, we might stick to one E for now.\n\n   After considering, I choose ""BELOW"". It\'s a common word and uses letters we haven\'t tried.\n\n   So second guess: BELOW.\n\n   We are going to submit ""below"".\n\n   But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid. ""below"" is a valid English word.\n\n   Therefore, we guess BELOW.\n\n   The expected format: <guess>BELOW</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, A, N are absent (x), so they can\'t be in the secret word.\n- E is present but misplaced (-), meaning it\'s in the word but not in the 5th position (since ""crane"" had E in position 5).\n\nFor the next guess:\n1. Must include E (since it\'s confirmed present).\n2. E must be placed in positions 1-4 (as position 5 is ruled out).\n3. Cannot include C, R, A, or N.\n4. Should test new common letters to maximize information.\n\nThe word ""BELOW"" meets these criteria:\n- Contains E in position 2 (a previously untested position).\n- Uses new letters: B, L, O, W (all common consonants/vowels).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N).\n- Is a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nThis guess will help identify the position of E and check for the presence of B, L, O, W.\n\n<guess>BELOW</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: BELOW -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A, N are not in the word.\n- E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: BELOW -> Feedback: B(x) E(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x)\nMeaning:\n- B, L, O, W are not in the word.\n- E is not only present, but it is correctly placed in position 2 (since in BELOW, E is at position 2 and we got a ✓).\n\nSo, now we know:\n- The secret word has E in position 2.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W.\n\nWe need to find a 5-letter word that has E in the second position and doesn\'t contain any of the excluded letters.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W.\n\nKnown: position 2 must be E, so the word is: _ E _ _ _\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but English letters).\n\nWe must consider that the word must be valid and we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nThe first guess had many vowels but missed, and now we know E is in the second position. The word likely has other vowels? But the word might have only one vowel? However, E is a vowel. There might be another vowel? Or sometimes Y.\n\nBut we have to avoid O and A, and include E.\n\nVowels left: I, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nSo the word pattern: ? E ? ? ?\n\nWe need to choose a next guess that uses remaining letters. We should avoid the excluded ones and include new letters to gather information.\n\nFor example, common remaining letters: S, T, D, M, P, etc.\n\nIdea: use a word that starts with a consonant we haven\'t tried, then E (fixed), and then other new letters.\n\nFor instance: \n- Try words like: ""DEPTH"" -> but D,E,P,T,H? But note, E is fixed at position 2? Wait, in DEPTH, the E is at position 2? D-E-P-T-H -> yes, position 2 is E. However, note: we did not try D, P, T, H before? Yes, and avoid excluded? We must avoid C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W. So DEPTH: D, E, P, T, H -> all new letters? Yes.\n\nBut DEPTH is a word? Yes, depth.\n\nAnother possibility: ""SETUP"" -> S-E-T-U-P? But E at position 2? S is first, E second? SETUP has letters S,E,T,U,P -> avoid excluded? No S in exclusions? No? Exclusions are C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W. S is not excluded.\n\nBut SETUP: E is at position 2? Yes, SETUP -> S-E-T-U-P.\n\nSimilarly, ""METRO"" -> but O is excluded (in BELOW we got O(x)), so O is absent. Therefore, we cannot use O? Wait, in BELOW: O(x), meaning O is not in the word? Correct, so avoid O.\n\nSo METRO is invalid.\n\nOther words: ""MEDIC"" -> C is excluded? C in the word? Also, N? Wait MEDIC: M,E,D,I,C? C is excluded? Yes, we cannot use C? Since guess1 had C(x). So MEDIC invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""FETUS"": F,E,T,U,S? Avoid excluded? F not excluded? Yes, and E is at position 2? F-E-T-U-S? Letter positions: F(1),E(2),T(3),U(4),S(5). Avoid C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W? Yes, FETUS is a word.\n\nBut note: we already know E is at position 2, so we are confirming that? Actually, we are using E in position 2 again? But that\'s okay because we know it\'s fixed? Yes, it might help confirm but also we are testing new letters.\n\nWe could also consider ""TESTY"": T,E,S,T,Y. But E at position 2? T-E-S-T-Y? Avoid excluded? Yes? But we have two T\'s? Could be? Same as any.\n\nBut I think DEPTH, FETUS, SETUP are candidates.\n\nGoal: to get information about other positions.\n\nWe must also remember: the first guess crane had E misplaced? Now it\'s fixed at position 2? The feedback only tells that in BELOW, E was correct? So in the secret word, position 2 is E.\n\nNow, the word must contain E only at position 2? Or could there be another E? We don\'t know. There might be another E? But if we guess a word with two E\'s, we might see feedback for both? However, we haven\'t gotten information about double E. It\'s possible.\n\nBut to avoid complications, we may guess a word without an extra E? Or with an extra E to test? But let\'s stick to testing new letters.\n\nAmong the candidates: \n  DEPTH: letters D, P, T, H\n  SETUP: S, T, U, P\n  FETUS: F, T, U, S\n\nWhich letters are more common? S, T are both common? T appears in all? \n\nBut note: U is a vowel? It might be present.\n\nWe also have to consider positions: the word might not have T? We don\'t know.\n\nTo maximize new letters: SETUP introduces S, T, U, P. \nDEPTH introduces D, P, T, H. H is less common? Maybe SETUP is better.\n\nBut FETUS: F, T, U, S? Also common.\n\nBut let me pick SETUP? Actually, I think SETUP might be good? It uses S, E, T, U, P? And E at position 2? Pattern: S E T U P.\n\nWait, SETUP: it spells SET-UP? But as a word, SETUP is an accepted? Yes.\n\nOr maybe ""SETUP"" might be not considered? We\'ll stick to common words.\n\nAnother possibility: ""GEIST"" -> G,E,I,S,T? Avoid excluded? Yes. But E at position 2? G-E-I-S-T -> yes. But maybe less common? \n\nI think SETUP is fine.\n\nBut note: SETUP and FETUS both have U? Which is a vowel? It might be present? \n\nWe know only E is confirmed? And A and O are excluded? So the secret word must have E and maybe other vowels: I or U or Y.\n\nPerhaps we can test U? In SETUP, we put U at position 4? Then if U is in the word, we might get feedback.\n\nSimilarly for FETUS.\n\nBut let\'s choose SETUP because it has more common consonants.\n\nAlternative: ""QUEST"" -> but U? Q? Does QUEST have E at position 2? QUEST -> Q-U-E-S-T? Then E is at position 3? Not 2? So wrong.\n\n""JUMPS"" -> No E? \n\nSo I choose SETUP? Or perhaps ""PETTY"": P-E-T-T-Y? E at 2? Avoid excluded? P,E,T,T,Y -> no excluded? But we are repeating T? T might be present? We don\'t know.\n\nBut SETUP doesn\'t repeat letters? Yes.\n\nSo SETUP: S,E,T,U,P -> five distinct letters? S,E,T,U,P? S and P? Distinct? Yes? And E at 2? Yes.\n\nTherefore, guess: SETUP.\n\nBut note: SETUP? The word is spelled S-E-T-U-P? In Wordle, SETUP is accepted? I think so.\n\nIf we don\'t want U, we could try ""STEIN"": S,E,T,I,N? But N? Guess1 crane had N(x), so N is excluded? We cannot use N! Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W => N is excluded? In crane, N(x)? Yes, so STEIN is invalid? Avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""SPEED"": S,E,E,D? E at position 2, and two E\'s? But S,P,E,E,D? Then positions: S1, E2, E3, E4,D5? But we have E twice? Also, we know E is at 2? But could the word have more E\'s? It\'s possible? But SPEED? Avoid excluded? S,P,E,D -> E we know, and avoid O,A,B,L,N? Yes? But wait: in first guess, we had E(-) so at least one E? But now we know position2 E(✓)? If we guess SPEED? We might get E2 as ✓ and then E3 and E4? They could be also E? So feedback? But let\'s avoid complexity? But SETUP is better? Or FETUS? \n\nFETUS: F,E,T,U,S? Has U? \n\nAlternatively, since we know E is at 2, we can focus on common words with E in second position.\n\nList: \n  LEVER? L excluded? L(x) in BELOW? L is excluded? BELOW:L(x), so yes? Avoid L.\n\n  REPAY? R and A excluded? Avoid.\n\n  BEADY? B and A excluded? Avoid.\n\n  SEIZE? S,E,I,Z,E? Position 2 E? Pattern: S E I Z E? Avoid excluded? C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W? Avoid? S,E,I,Z,E? E repeats? But yes? Available? Except I and Z? But I haven\'t been ruled? Also? BELOW had O(x), etc.\n\n  But SEIZE: S,E,I,Z,E? Positions: S1,E2,I3,Z4,E5? But we know E is at position 2? And also at position 5? But we got E(-) in crane? Meaning E was misplaced at position5? Now if the secret has E only at position2, then when we guess SEIZE? Position5 E would be absent? Or if the secret has two E\'s? However, let\'s check: if secret has E only at position2? Then in SEIZE, we would get E2 as ✓ (green) and E5 would be absent? But the letter E? Then for E5: since the secret word has only one E? Then E5 would be marked? How? It would be x? Because it\'s absent? Or if the secret has two E\'s? We don\'t know.\n\n  But this might be too risky? Instead, we choose SETUP? Or FETUS? Or DEPTH?\n\nI think FETUS? Or maybe ""TEETH"": T,E,E,T,H? E repeats? Avoid? \n\nBut note: another word: ""DEITY""? D,E,I,T,Y? Avoid excluded? Yes? Pattern D E I T Y? E at 2? Yes? But Y? \n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nActually, since we know so many letters are absent, the list might be constrained? We should choose a word that covers new frequent letters.\n\nPerhaps DEPTH is better? DEPTH: D,E,P,T,H? All new letters? And E at 2? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, SETUP has U? Which is a vowel? That might be useful.\n\nI\'ll go with DEPTH? Because it has T? T is very common? And P? And D? And H? \n\nDEPTH: common word? Yes.\n\nSet guess: DEPTH.\n\nBut let me confirm: The word DEPTH contains D,E,P,T,H? And E is at position2? Yes: positions: 1:D,2:E,3:P,4:T,5:H.\n\nAvoid excluded? We haven\'t excluded D,P,T,H? Correct? \n\nTherefore, let us guess DEPTH.\n\nExpected format: <guess>DEPTH</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- From Guess 1 (""crane""), we learned that C, R, A, N are **absent** (x), and E is **present** but misplaced (-) (i.e., not in position 5).\n- From Guess 2 (""BELOW""), we learned that B, L, O, W are **absent** (x), and E is **correctly placed (✓) in position 2**.\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word must have E in **position 2**.\n- Letters C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W are completely ruled out.\n- Therefore, the secret word pattern is: `_ E _ _ _` (where E occupies the second position).\n- Remaining letters must come from the unused set: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, S, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nStrategy for the next guess:\n- Prioritize a word that places E in position 2 and uses new, common letters from the remaining set to maximize information gain.\n- Avoid excluded letters (C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W).\n- Aim for distinct letters where possible to test more potential candidates.\n\nChosen word: **DEPTH**\n- **D**, **P**, **T**, and **H** are all untested letters.\n- The word fits the pattern `_ E _ _ _` with E in position 2.\n- ""DEPTH"" is a valid English word meaning the deepness of something.\n\nThis guess tests four new letters in key positions:\n- Position 1: D\n- Position 3: P\n- Position 4: T\n- Position 5: H\n\nFeedback will help pinpoint correct letters/positions and further constrain possibilities.\n\n<guess>DEPTH</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: BELOW -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x)\nGuess 3: DEPTH -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) P(x) T(✓) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was guessed in position 5 and got '-')

Guess 2: BELOW -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x)
Meaning:
- Letters B, L, O, W are not in the word.
- E is correct and in the 2nd position (✓). So the second letter of the secret word is E.

Guess 3: DEPTH -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) P(x) T(✓) H(x)
Meaning:
- D is correct and in the 1st position (since D was in position 1 and got ✓). So the first letter is D.
- E is correct and in the 2nd position (as we already knew).
- P is not in the word (x).
- T is correct and in the 4th position (since T was in position 4 and got ✓). So the fourth letter is T.
- H is not in the word (x).

Therefore, from this, we know the secret word so far is: D E _ T _

Known positions:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: E
- Position 4: T

Also, we know the word has an E (which is already placed) and no other known letters? The T and D are also placed.

Moreover, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W, P, H.

Now, from the feedback of crane, we had E as present but misplaced. However, in the secret word, E is in position 2. So why was it misplaced in crane? Because in crane, E was put in position 5 and that was wrong? So that matches? It doesn't give new information? However, note that in crane, we did not have E in position 2? Because we didn't yet know? But the secret word has E in position2? Then when we guessed crane, E was incorrectly in position5? So the feedback was '-' meaning it's in the word but not there? Correct? So no additional E? Because if there was a fifth-position E? We already know H? But we don't have an E elsewhere? But the feedback didn't indicate another E? Actually, the feedback only comments on the letters guessed? Since we didn't guess E elsewhere? 

Now, we know the third and fifth positions are missing. We need to find letters for positions 3 and 5.

Excluded letters so far: C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W, P, H.

Therefore, the letters we can use: F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z (and possibly others?).

The word is: D E ? T ?

We need a 5-letter English word that matches D E _ T _ and uses only letters from the available set and no excluded ones.

Let's think of common words:

For example:
- ""DEITY"": D,E,I,T,Y -> positions: D1,E2,I3,T4,Y5? But is it a word? Yes, deity. But we haven't excluded I and Y? And they are not in the excluded list? Also, P and H are excluded? But DEITY has no P or H? So valid? 

But let me check: excluded letters: C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W,P,H. So I and Y are not excluded? Correct.

Alternatively:
- ""DEUTZ""? Is that a word? Not common.
- ""DEATH""? But A is excluded? Guess1 crane: A(x) -> so absent? Also H is now excluded? So DEATH has A and H? Both absent? Invalid.
- ""DELFT"": but L is excluded? O is excluded? DELFT has D,E,L,F,T? L is excluded? From BELOW: L(x) -> invalid.
- ""DEPOT"": P and O excluded? Invalid.
- ""DIRTY"": D,E? Wait, DIRTY: D,I,R,T,Y? R is excluded? From guess1: R(x) -> invalid.

So DEITY: D, E, I, T, Y? But our pattern: position3 is I? position5 is Y? So D E I T Y? That's DEITY? Yes.

But note: the second letter is E? Which we have? Fourth is T? Correct.

But what about the vowels? We have E and I? 

Another possibility: ""DEBTS"": B excluded? and E? But DEBTS: D,E,B,T,S? B is excluded? From BELOW: B(x) -> invalid.

""DEFAT"": A excluded? and F? But A is absent? So invalid? DEFAT: D,E,F,A,T -> A is absent? and T? Position matches? But A is excluded? So invalid.

""DEMIT"": M? But D,E,M,I,T? Positions: D1,E2,M3,I4,T5 -> but we have position4 should be T? But in DEMIT, T is at position5? Not 4? So fourth letter would be I? But we need fourth letter T? So DEMIT: positions: D(1),E(2),M(3),I(4),T(5)? So at position4 is I? But we need T at position4? Invalid pattern.

Wait: our pattern: D E _ T _ -> so position1:D,2:E,3:?,4:T,5:?

So we need a letter at position3 and position5? And the word must be valid? 

DEITY: D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5)? So positions: yes? The fourth letter is T? Correct? Yes? 

But note: DEITY has T at fourth? Yes? 

Another word: ""DENTS"": E? But T is at fourth? D,E,N,T,S? But N is excluded? And S? But N: crane had N(x)? So excluded? Invalid.

""DEIST"": D,E,I,S,T? But positions: D1,E2,I3,S4,T5? Then fourth letter is S? But we need fourth letter to be T? So position4 must be T? If we put T at fifth? But the feedback for DEPTH: T was at position4 and got ✓. So the secret word has T at position4? Therefore, in DEIST, we cannot put T at fifth? Unless there are two T's? But even then? The feedback? 

Wait, the feedback for DEPTH: T was at position4 and got ✓? So the secret word has T at position4? Therefore, any word we guess must have T at position4? Unless the letter T appears twice? But we don't know? However, the feedback only showed one T? So if the word had two T's, it would have shown? Actually, no? Because we haven't guessed more than one T?

Therefore, we must keep T at position4? The third and fifth positions are unknown? No fixed letters? 

So pattern: D E ? T ?

Now, DEITY: D E I T Y? Matches? And I and Y are not excluded? 

""DEVOT"": O and T? O excluded? Invalid.

""DECAY"": C, A? Excluded? Invalid.

""DEFTY""? Not a word.

""DEMPT""? Not a word.

""DEPOT"": O excluded? Invalid.

So DEITY: Deity, meaning a god? Valid?

""DEBUT"": D,E,B,U,T? B excluded? BELOW: B(x)? So invalid.

""DESTO""? Not common? Also O excluded? Invalid.

Another: ""DEKKO""? Not common? and K? K not excluded? But D,E,K,K,O? O excluded? Invalid.

""DENET""? N excluded? Invalid.

""DEPTH"": already guessed? So not to be guessed again? Also, DEPTH: we know H is absent? So H in fifth position? Now we have feedback H(x)? So DEITY does not have H? So it should be valid? 

Possibly ""DEUTZ""? Not English.

""DESEX""? But X? and positions? D,E,S,E,X? Then E at position4? But our pattern has T at position4? So invalid? 

Another idea: ""DEIST"": D,E,I,S,T? But pattern: D1,E2,I3,S4,T5? So fourth position is S? But we need T at position4? So unless we put T somewhere else? We cannot? Therefore, the word must be D E ? T ? 

So possible words that fit D E ? T ? and avoid excluded letters? 

DEITY: D E I T Y? Yes? And not in excluded? 

Another word: ""TESTY""? T at position1? But we need D? 

""DELTS"": L excluded? Invalid.

""DEFIS"": F,I,S? But D,E,F,I,S? Positions: D1,E2,F3,I4,S5? Then fourth letter I? We need T at fourth? So invalid.

""DEVI"": Only four letters? 

Therefore, DEITY seems a strong candidate? Also? The letters I and Y? We haven't tested? 

Alternatively, ""DEMIT"": D,E,M,I,T? Positions: D1,E2,M3,I4,T5? Then fourth position I? But we need T at fourth? So unless we have T twice? But we haven't tried? 

Similarly, ""DEVOT"": O excluded? 

Another: ""DEWIT"": E we have? W excluded? BELOW: W(x)? Invalid.

""DENET"": N excluded? 

Perhaps ""JEFE"": Not 5-letters? 

I think DEITY is valid? 

But wait: let's confirm excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W,P,H? Yes? So I and Y are okay? 

Also, DEITY is a valid English word? Yes? 

So why didn't we think of this earlier? Now? We have only two positions left? Position3 and position5? 

Therefore, we can guess DEITY? 

But note: we have 3 guesses left? So we can try? 

So guessed word: DEITY

But wait: position4 is T? Our pattern requires? Yes? And DEITY has T? 

Now? We can't see feedback? But let's write?

In fact? With the known letters? It might be the word? 

Another possibility? What if the word has another T? We had T at position4? Could T be elsewhere? But we guessed DEPTH which has T at position4? And got T(✓)? So T is at position4? Not elsewhere? Unless there is another T? But at other positions? For example? Position3? But then? 

For example? If we had a word like ""DEITT""? Not valid? But even then? We have to have position4: T? 

Therefore? DEITY? 

An alternative: ""DECID""? not valid? 

I think DEITY is the best? 

So choose DEITY? 

But note: position5? We have to choose? 

Perhaps there is another word? 

Let us list words matching D E ? T ? :

Possible words? With available letters? 

For position3: we have F,G,I,J,K,M,Q,S,U,V,X,Y,Z? 

For position5: same? 

Now? Common words? 

- DEITY: I,Y? 

""DESTO""? O excluded? Invalid? 

""DEPTH"": already guessed? 

""DRYET""? R excluded? Invalid? 

""DUETO""? O? Excluded? Invalid? 

""DYEST"": Y,E,S,T? But we can't have E again? Pattern D E ? T ? ? 

Yes? so D E Y T S? Is that a word? No? 

""DEVTS""? No? 

Therefore? Only valid word I can think of is DEITY? 

Perhaps ""DEMIT""? But it would be D E M I T? Then fifth letter T? But we need T at fourth? So pattern? We set position4: T? Then position3 and position5: ? 

Therefore? D E M T T? Then ""DEMTT""? Not valid? So DEITY seems the one? 

""DEUTA""? Not valid? 

So we go with DEITY? 

Therefore? guess: DEITY? 

Format: <guess>DEITY</guess>? 

But I have a doubt? Because E at position2? The secret word must not have E in other positions? But we don't have information? However? In crane? E was misplaced at position5? Meaning? The word does not have E at position5? So in DEITY? E is only at position2? And position5 is Y? Which is fine? 

No reason to believe? Otherwise? 

So submit: DEITY? 

After analysis? The secret word matches the pattern D E ? T ? and the only common word we found? DEITY. We also avoid excluded letters? And it includes I at position3 and Y at position5? 

Let us also check if Y is allowed? Yes? 

Therefore? 

Step by step: 
- Known positions? 1:D,2:E,4:T? 
- Missing: position3 and position5? 
- Available letters exclude? C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W,P,H? 
- Candidate? DEITY? D,E,I,T,Y? 
- Pattern matches? D1,E2,I3,T4,Y5? 

Yes? 

So we guess? DEITY? 

If there is a double T? But DEITY doesn't have that? 

Another word? ""DEBTY""? But B excluded? 

So? 

We go with DEITY? 

Final guess: DEITY? 

Output in the required format.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Crane**: C, R, A, N are absent; E is present but not in position 5.
- **BELOW**: B, L, O, W are absent; E is correctly placed in position 2.
- **DEPTH**: P and H are absent; D is correctly placed in position 1; T is correctly placed in position 4.

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the following fixed letters: **D** in position 1, **E** in position 2, and **T** in position 4.
- The pattern is: **D E \_ T \_** (positions 3 and 5 are unknown).
- Absent letters (cannot be used): C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W, P, H (from all feedback).
- Remaining letters for positions 3 and 5 must come from: F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy:
- The only common 5-letter English word fitting the pattern **D E \_ T \_** with the available letters and avoiding absent letters is **DEITY**:
  - D (position 1), E (position 2), I (position 3), T (position 4), Y (position 5).
- **DEITY** uses I and Y (both untested and allowed), and confirms if the secret word matches the pattern.
- Since feedback has pinned 3 letters correctly and only two positions remain, **DEITY** tests these efficiently.

<guess>DEITY</guess>",DEITY,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- Letters C, R, A, N are not in the word.
- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was guessed in position 5 and got '-')

Guess 2: BELOW -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) L(x) O(x) W(x)
Meaning:
- Letters B, L, O, W are not in the word.
- E is correct and in the 2nd position (✓). So the second letter of the secret word is E.

Guess 3: DEPTH -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) E(✓) P(x) T(✓) H(x)
Meaning:
- D is correct and in the 1st position (since D was in position 1 and got ✓). So the first letter is D.
- E is correct and in the 2nd position (as we already knew).
- P is not in the word (x).
- T is correct and in the 4th position (since T was in position 4 and got ✓). So the fourth letter is T.
- H is not in the word (x).

Therefore, from this, we know the secret word so far is: D E _ T _

Known positions:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: E
- Position 4: T

Also, we know the word has an E (which is already placed) and no other known letters? The T and D are also placed.

Moreover, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W, P, H.

Now, from the feedback of crane, we had E as present but misplaced. However, in the secret word, E is in position 2. So why was it misplaced in crane? Because in crane, E was put in position 5 and that was wrong? So that matches? It doesn't give new information? However, note that in crane, we did not have E in position 2? Because we didn't yet know? But the secret word has E in position2? Then when we guessed crane, E was incorrectly in position5? So the feedback was '-' meaning it's in the word but not there? Correct? So no additional E? Because if there was a fifth-position E? We already know H? But we don't have an E elsewhere? But the feedback didn't indicate another E? Actually, the feedback only comments on the letters guessed? Since we didn't guess E elsewhere? 

Now, we know the third and fifth positions are missing. We need to find letters for positions 3 and 5.

Excluded letters so far: C, R, A, N, B, L, O, W, P, H.

Therefore, the letters we can use: F, G, I, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, X, Y, Z (and possibly others?).

The word is: D E ? T ?

We need a 5-letter English word that matches D E _ T _ and uses only letters from the available set and no excluded ones.

Let's think of common words:

For example:
- ""DEITY"": D,E,I,T,Y -> positions: D1,E2,I3,T4,Y5? But is it a word? Yes, deity. But we haven't excluded I and Y? And they are not in the excluded list? Also, P and H are excluded? But DEITY has no P or H? So valid? 

But let me check: excluded letters: C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W,P,H. So I and Y are not excluded? Correct.

Alternatively:
- ""DEUTZ""? Is that a word? Not common.
- ""DEATH""? But A is excluded? Guess1 crane: A(x) -> so absent? Also H is now excluded? So DEATH has A and H? Both absent? Invalid.
- ""DELFT"": but L is excluded? O is excluded? DELFT has D,E,L,F,T? L is excluded? From BELOW: L(x) -> invalid.
- ""DEPOT"": P and O excluded? Invalid.
- ""DIRTY"": D,E? Wait, DIRTY: D,I,R,T,Y? R is excluded? From guess1: R(x) -> invalid.

So DEITY: D, E, I, T, Y? But our pattern: position3 is I? position5 is Y? So D E I T Y? That's DEITY? Yes.

But note: the second letter is E? Which we have? Fourth is T? Correct.

But what about the vowels? We have E and I? 

Another possibility: ""DEBTS"": B excluded? and E? But DEBTS: D,E,B,T,S? B is excluded? From BELOW: B(x) -> invalid.

""DEFAT"": A excluded? and F? But A is absent? So invalid? DEFAT: D,E,F,A,T -> A is absent? and T? Position matches? But A is excluded? So invalid.

""DEMIT"": M? But D,E,M,I,T? Positions: D1,E2,M3,I4,T5 -> but we have position4 should be T? But in DEMIT, T is at position5? Not 4? So fourth letter would be I? But we need fourth letter T? So DEMIT: positions: D(1),E(2),M(3),I(4),T(5)? So at position4 is I? But we need T at position4? Invalid pattern.

Wait: our pattern: D E _ T _ -> so position1:D,2:E,3:?,4:T,5:?

So we need a letter at position3 and position5? And the word must be valid? 

DEITY: D(1), E(2), I(3), T(4), Y(5)? So positions: yes? The fourth letter is T? Correct? Yes? 

But note: DEITY has T at fourth? Yes? 

Another word: ""DENTS"": E? But T is at fourth? D,E,N,T,S? But N is excluded? And S? But N: crane had N(x)? So excluded? Invalid.

""DEIST"": D,E,I,S,T? But positions: D1,E2,I3,S4,T5? Then fourth letter is S? But we need fourth letter to be T? So position4 must be T? If we put T at fifth? But the feedback for DEPTH: T was at position4 and got ✓. So the secret word has T at position4? Therefore, in DEIST, we cannot put T at fifth? Unless there are two T's? But even then? The feedback? 

Wait, the feedback for DEPTH: T was at position4 and got ✓? So the secret word has T at position4? Therefore, any word we guess must have T at position4? Unless the letter T appears twice? But we don't know? However, the feedback only showed one T? So if the word had two T's, it would have shown? Actually, no? Because we haven't guessed more than one T?

Therefore, we must keep T at position4? The third and fifth positions are unknown? No fixed letters? 

So pattern: D E ? T ?

Now, DEITY: D E I T Y? Matches? And I and Y are not excluded? 

""DEVOT"": O and T? O excluded? Invalid.

""DECAY"": C, A? Excluded? Invalid.

""DEFTY""? Not a word.

""DEMPT""? Not a word.

""DEPOT"": O excluded? Invalid.

So DEITY: Deity, meaning a god? Valid?

""DEBUT"": D,E,B,U,T? B excluded? BELOW: B(x)? So invalid.

""DESTO""? Not common? Also O excluded? Invalid.

Another: ""DEKKO""? Not common? and K? K not excluded? But D,E,K,K,O? O excluded? Invalid.

""DENET""? N excluded? Invalid.

""DEPTH"": already guessed? So not to be guessed again? Also, DEPTH: we know H is absent? So H in fifth position? Now we have feedback H(x)? So DEITY does not have H? So it should be valid? 

Possibly ""DEUTZ""? Not English.

""DESEX""? But X? and positions? D,E,S,E,X? Then E at position4? But our pattern has T at position4? So invalid? 

Another idea: ""DEIST"": D,E,I,S,T? But pattern: D1,E2,I3,S4,T5? So fourth position is S? But we need T at position4? So unless we put T somewhere else? We cannot? Therefore, the word must be D E ? T ? 

So possible words that fit D E ? T ? and avoid excluded letters? 

DEITY: D E I T Y? Yes? And not in excluded? 

Another word: ""TESTY""? T at position1? But we need D? 

""DELTS"": L excluded? Invalid.

""DEFIS"": F,I,S? But D,E,F,I,S? Positions: D1,E2,F3,I4,S5? Then fourth letter I? We need T at fourth? So invalid.

""DEVI"": Only four letters? 

Therefore, DEITY seems a strong candidate? Also? The letters I and Y? We haven't tested? 

Alternatively, ""DEMIT"": D,E,M,I,T? Positions: D1,E2,M3,I4,T5? Then fourth position I? But we need T at fourth? So unless we have T twice? But we haven't tried? 

Similarly, ""DEVOT"": O excluded? 

Another: ""DEWIT"": E we have? W excluded? BELOW: W(x)? Invalid.

""DENET"": N excluded? 

Perhaps ""JEFE"": Not 5-letters? 

I think DEITY is valid? 

But wait: let's confirm excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,B,L,O,W,P,H? Yes? So I and Y are okay? 

Also, DEITY is a valid English word? Yes? 

So why didn't we think of this earlier? Now? We have only two positions left? Position3 and position5? 

Therefore, we can guess DEITY? 

But note: we have 3 guesses left? So we can try? 

So guessed word: DEITY

But wait: position4 is T? Our pattern requires? Yes? And DEITY has T? 

Now? We can't see feedback? But let's write?

In fact? With the known letters? It might be the word? 

Another possibility? What if the word has another T? We had T at position4? Could T be elsewhere? But we guessed DEPTH which has T at position4? And got T(✓)? So T is at position4? Not elsewhere? Unless there is another T? But at other positions? For example? Position3? But then? 

For example? If we had a word like ""DEITT""? Not valid? But even then? We have to have position4: T? 

Therefore? DEITY? 

An alternative: ""DECID""? not valid? 

I think DEITY is the best? 

So choose DEITY? 

But note: position5? We have to choose? 

Perhaps there is another word? 

Let us list words matching D E ? T ? :

Possible words? With available letters? 

For position3: we have F,G,I,J,K,M,Q,S,U,V,X,Y,Z?

""DESTO""? O excluded? Invalid? 

""DEPTH"": already guessed? 

""DRYET""? R excluded? Invalid? 

""DUETO""? O? Excluded? Invalid? 

""DYEST"": Y,E,S,T? But we can't have E again? Pattern D E ? T ? ? 

Yes? so D E Y T S? Is that a word? No? 

""DEVTS""? No? 

Therefore? Only valid word I can think of is DEITY? 

Perhaps ""DEMIT""? But it would be D E M I T? Then fifth letter T? But we need T at fourth? So pattern? We set position4: T? Then position3 and position5: ? 

Therefore? D E M T T? Then ""DEMTT""? Not valid? So DEITY seems the one? 

""DEUTA""? Not valid? 

So we go with DEITY? 

Therefore? guess: DEITY?

Yes? 

So we guess? DEITY? 

If there is a double T? But DEITY doesn't have that? 

Another word? ""DEBTY""? But B excluded? 

So? 

We go with DEITY? 

Final guess: DEITY?
