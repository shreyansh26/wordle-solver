We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: (-) meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- R: (-) meaning R is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the secret word.
- N: (x) meaning N is not in the secret word.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters C and R, but not in the first and second positions (since in ""crane"", C is at position 1 and R at position 2, and they are marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain A, N, or E.

We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes C and R (since they are in the secret word).
- Does not include A, N, E.
- We should try to place C and R in different positions than the first guess (because in the first guess, they were in positions 1 and 2 and that was wrong).

In the first guess, C was at position 1 and R at position 2. Since they are in the word but not in those positions, we can try placing C in positions 2,3,4,5 and R in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not position 2 because that was already tried and was wrong? Actually, note: the feedback doesn't tell us that they can't be in other positions, but we know that the positions we tried (1 for C and 2 for R) are incorrect for those letters).

We also want to avoid the letters A, N, E.

We should try to use other common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that have C and R, and avoid A, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, H, I, L, O, S, T, U, etc.

We can try to put C and R in new positions. For example, let's try to put R in the first position and C in the third? Or R in the third and C in the fourth? We have flexibility.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- We could try ""ROCKS"" but that has O and S which we don't know about, but also K and S. However, note that we have to avoid A, N, E. But ""ROCKS"" has O, which is allowed? Yes, because we haven't ruled out O.

But wait: we have to consider that the feedback for the first guess only ruled out A, N, E. So O, S, T, etc. are still possible.

However, we have two letters we must include: C and R.

Let me list some words that contain both C and R, without A, N, E.

Examples:
- ""CROWD"" -> C at 1, R at 2? But in the first guess, we had C at 1 and R at 2 and they were wrong. So we should avoid putting C at 1 and R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know that position 1 is not C and position 2 is not R. So we should try different positions.

We know:
- C cannot be at position 1 (because in ""crane"" it was at 1 and marked wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not at position 1).
- Similarly, R cannot be at position 2 (because in ""crane"" it was at 2 and marked wrong position).

So for our next guess, we should avoid putting C at position 1 and R at position 2.

We can try:
- R at position 1 and C at position 3? Or C at position 4? etc.

Let me think of words that start with R (so R at position 1) and have C somewhere else, but not at position 2? Actually, we can put C at any position except 1? But note: we don't know if C can be at position 2? The feedback only said that position 1 is not C. Similarly, position 2 is not R, but R can be at other positions.

So possible words:

- ""R"" at position 1 and ""C"" at position 3: words like ""TRICK"" but T is allowed? But we don't have T in the word yet. However, ""TRICK"" has T, R, I, C, K. But note: we must avoid A, N, E. So ""TRICK"" is okay.

But we also want to cover more new letters. We have only used C, R, A, N, E. So we have 21 letters left to try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and C at position 4? Or position 5?

Another idea: ""CRISP"" but that has C at 1 and R at 2, which we know are wrong positions for C and R respectively. So we avoid that.

We can try ""PORCH"": 
- P, O, R, C, H. 
- R is at position 3, C at position 4. 
- This avoids putting C at 1 and R at 2. 
- Also, no A, N, E.

But we don't know if O, P, H are in the word.

Another word: ""CRUSH"" but again, C at 1 and R at 2, which we know are wrong.

We need to move R and C to different positions.

How about ""SCRUB""? That's 5 letters? S, C, R, U, B -> positions: S(1), C(2), R(3). 
But note: we know that position 2 is not R? Actually, we know that in the first guess, position 2 was R and it was wrong. But in this word, position 2 is C. Is that okay? We don't have a restriction on C at position 2? Only that C cannot be at position 1. So C at position 2 is allowed? We don't know yet.

Similarly, we can have R at position 3? That's allowed because we only know that position 2 is not R.

So ""SCRUB"" is a candidate: S, C, R, U, B.

But let me check: we have S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.

We haven't tried S, U, B. And we are including C and R.

Another candidate: ""TRACE"" but we cannot use E (because E is ruled out) and also A is ruled out? Wait, in ""TRACE"", there is A and E, which are both ruled out. So we cannot use ""TRACE"".

How about ""CRWTH""? Not common.

Another: ""BIRCH"" -> B, I, R, C, H. 
- R is at position 3, C at position 4. 
- Avoids A, N, E.

But we have to consider the positions: we are putting R at 3 and C at 4. That's new.

We can also consider ""DICER"" but E is ruled out.

So ""BIRCH"" seems good.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another idea: ""SHOCK"" -> S, H, O, C, K. 
- C is at position 4. 
- But does it have R? No, we must include R because we know R is in the word. So we cannot omit R.

So we must have both C and R.

Let me try to list words with C and R, without A, N, E, and with R not at position 2 and C not at position 1.

Possible words:
- ""PORCH"" (P, O, R, C, H) -> R at 3, C at 4.
- ""BIRCH"" (B, I, R, C, H) -> R at 3, C at 4.
- ""CRISP"" is invalid because C at 1 and R at 2.
- ""CROWD"" is invalid because C at 1 and R at 2.
- ""ROCKY"" (R, O, C, K, Y) -> R at 1, C at 3. This is good because R is at 1 (which is not position 2) and C at 3 (which is not position 1). Also, no A, N, E.

""ROCKY"" is a valid word.

Another: ""CRUMB"" -> C at 1 and R at 2: invalid.

""SCRAP"" -> has A (ruled out) and C at 2? But also has A.

""SCREW"" -> S, C, R, E, W -> has E (ruled out).

""SCRUB"" -> S, C, R, U, B -> no A, N, E. 
- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3). 
- We know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting C at position 2. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't know about position 2 for C. Similarly, R is at position 3, which is new.

So ""SCRUB"" is a candidate.

Now, which one to choose? We want to maximize information.

In ""ROCKY"": 
- We are trying R at position 1 (which we haven't tried before) and C at position 3 (we had C at 1 before, now at 3). 
- We are also trying O, K, Y.

In ""SCRUB"": 
- We are trying S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U, B. 
- We are trying more new letters: S, U, B.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try more letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has C and R and also uses common vowels that we haven't tried. We haven't tried I, O, U (since A and E are out). 

The word ""PRICE"" has E, which is out.

""ORCIN"" has N? And N is out.

""BORIC"" -> B, O, R, I, C. 
- R at position 3, C at position 5. 
- Avoids A, N, E.

But ""BORIC"" is a word? It's an adjective relating to or derived from borax. It might be less common.

""RICIN"" has N? And N is out.

Another common word: ""CRISP"" is invalid.

""CRIMP"" -> C at 1, R at 2: invalid.

""ROUCH"" is not common.

""COURT"" -> C at 1, which we know is wrong? But we can avoid C at 1. In ""COURT"", C is at 1, so we shouldn't use that.

""TRUCE"" has E.

""BRICK"" -> B, R, I, C, K. 
- R at position 2? But we know that position 2 is not R (from the first guess). So we cannot put R at position 2. 
- In ""BRICK"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid.

But if we put R at position 1? Then we have ""BRICK"" but with R at 1? That would be ""R"" at 1 and then ... but ""BRICK"" has R at 2.

How about ""R"" at 1 and ""C"" at 4? Like ""RELIC"" but has E.

""RHINO"" has N and O? But N is out.

""ROBOT"" -> R at 1, but no C? We must include C.

So we need both.

I think ""ROCKY"" and ""SCRUB"" are good candidates.

Let me compare:
- ""ROCKY"": R at 1, O at 2, C at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.
  - We are testing R at position 1 (which is new) and C at position 3 (new). Also, O, K, Y are new.
- ""SCRUB"": S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.
  - We are testing C at position 2 (which we haven't tried for C) and R at position 3 (new). Also, S, U, B are new.

We might get more information from ""SCRUB"" because it has S and U, which are common.

But note: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was wrong. Now, if we put C at position 2, that might be correct? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C and R and also uses a vowel we haven't tried, like I or O or U.

Another candidate: ""OUNCE"" has E? Out.

""CLOUR"" -> C at 1: invalid.

""MICRO"" -> M, I, C, R, O. 
- C at position 3, R at position 4. 
- Avoids A, N, E. 
- Positions: M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5). 
- We haven't tried M, I, O. 
- And we are putting C at 3 and R at 4, which are new positions.

This seems good.

But is ""MICRO"" a valid word? Yes, as in microcomputer, etc.

So now we have:
- ""ROCKY"": R at 1, O at 2, C at 3, K at 4, Y at 5
- ""SCRUB"": S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5
- ""MICRO"": M at 1, I at 2, C at 3, R at 4, O at 5

We want to choose one that maximizes the chance of getting more feedback.

Note: We know the secret word has C and R, and we are trying to find their positions and other letters.

I think ""MICRO"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places C and R in new positions (3 and 4). Also, it tests M, I, O.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more high-frequency letters.

Another word: ""CHOIR"" -> C at 1: invalid.

""CRITH"" is not common.

I think ""MICRO"" is a solid choice.

But wait, in ""MICRO"", we are putting I at position 2. We don't know if I is in the word, but it's a common vowel.

Alternatively, we can use ""PORCH"" which has P, O, R, C, H. R at 3, C at 4.

But ""PORCH"" uses O and H, which are common.

I think I'll go with ""MICRO"" because it tests M and I, which we haven't tried.

But note: we are trying to avoid repeating positions. We know C is not at 1, so we put it at 3. R is not at 2, so we put it at 4.

So let's choose ""MICRO"".

But wait, what about the feedback? We might get more information.

Another candidate: ""PUCKS"" has U, C, K, S. But no R? We must include R.

So I think ""MICRO"" is a good choice.

Therefore, our second guess is ""MICRO"".

But let me confirm: 
- We are including C and R, which we know are in the word.
- We are avoiding A, N, E.
- We are using new positions for C (position 3) and R (position 4).
- We are testing new letters: M, I, O.

So, we guess ""MICRO"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked as wrong position).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked as wrong position).
- A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked as absent).

For the second guess:
- Must include C and R (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoid A, N, E (since they are absent).
- Place C in a new position (not 1) and R in a new position (not 2) to test different locations.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain.

The word ""micro"" fits these criteria:
- Contains C (position 3) and R (position 4), both in new positions.
- Avoids A, N, E.
- Introduces new letters: M, I, O (common vowels/consonants not yet tested).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of C and R while testing three additional letters.

<guess>micro</guess>",micro,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: (-) meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- R: (-) meaning R is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the secret word.
- N: (x) meaning N is not in the secret word.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the secret word.

So, we know:

""SCREW"" -> S, C, R, E, W -> has E (ruled out).

""SCRUB"" -> S, C, R, U, B -> no A, N, E. 
- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3). 
- We know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting C at position 2. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't know about position 2 for C. Similarly, R is at position 3, which is new.

So ""SCRUB"" is a candidate.

Now, which one to choose? We want to maximize information.

In ""ROCKY"": 
- We are trying R at position 1 (which we haven't tried before) and C at position 3 (we had C at 1 before, now at 3). 
- We are also trying O, K, Y.

In ""SCRUB"": 
- We are trying S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U, B. 
- We are trying more new letters: S, U, B.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try more letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has C and R and also uses common vowels that we haven't tried. We haven't tried I, O, U (since A and E are out). 

The word ""PRICE"" has E, which is out.

""ORCIN"" has N? And N is out.

""BORIC"" -> B, O, R, I, C. 
- R at position 3, C at position 5. 
- Avoids A, N, E.

But ""BORIC"" is a word? It's an adjective relating to or derived from borax. It might be less common.

""RICIN"" has N? And N is out.

Another common word: ""CRISP"" is invalid.

""CRIMP"" -> C at 1, R at 2: invalid.

""ROUCH"" is not common.

""COURT"" -> C at 1, which we know is wrong? But we can avoid C at 1. In ""COURT"", C is at 1, so we shouldn't use that.

""TRUCE"" has E.

""BRICK"" -> B, R, I, C, K. 
- R at position 2? But we know that position 2 is not R (from the first guess). So we cannot put R at position 2. 
- In ""BRICK"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid.

But if we put R at position 1? Then we have ""BRICK"" but with R at 1? That would be ""R"" at 1 and then ... but ""BRICK"" has R at 2.

How about ""R"" at 1 and ""C"" at 4? Like ""RELIC"" but has E.

""RHINO"" has N and O? But N is out.

""ROBOT"" -> R at 1, but no C? We must include C.

So we need both.

I think ""ROCKY"" and ""SCRUB"" are good candidates.

Let me compare:
- ""ROCKY"": R at 1, O at 2, C at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.
  - We are testing R at position 1 (which is new) and C at position 3 (new). Also, O, K, Y are new.
- ""SCRUB"": S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.
  - We are testing C at position 2 (which we haven't tried for C) and R at position 3 (new). Also, S, U, B are new.

We might get more information from ""SCRUB"" because it has S and U, which are common.

But note: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was wrong. Now, if we put C at position 2, that might be correct? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C and R and also uses a vowel we haven't tried, like I or O or U.

Another candidate: ""OUNCE"" has E? Out.

""CLOUR"" -> C at 1: invalid.

""MICRO"" -> M, I, C, R, O. 
- C at position 3, R at position 4. 
- Avoids A, N, E. 
- Positions: M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5). 
- We haven't tried M, I, O. 
- And we are putting C at 3 and R at 4, which are new positions.

This seems good.

But is ""MICRO"" a valid word? Yes, as in microcomputer, etc.

So now we have:
- ""ROCKY"": R at 1, O at 2, C at 3, K at 4, Y at 5
- ""SCRUB"": S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5
- ""MICRO"": M at 1, I at 2, C at 3, R at 4, O at 5

We want to choose one that maximizes the chance of getting more feedback.

Note: We know the secret word has C and R, and we are trying to find their positions and other letters.

I think ""MICRO"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places C and R in new positions (3 and 4). Also, it tests M, I, O.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more high-frequency letters.

Another word: ""CHOIR"" -> C at 1: invalid.

""CRITH"" is not common.

I think ""MICRO"" is a solid choice.

But wait, in ""MICRO"", we are putting I at position 2. We don't know if I is in the word, but it's a common vowel.

Alternatively, we can use ""PORCH"" which has P, O, R, C, H. R at 3, C at 4.

But ""PORCH"" uses O and H, which are common.

I think I'll go with ""MICRO"" because it tests M and I, which we haven't tried.

But note: we are trying to avoid repeating positions. We know C is not at 1, so we put it at 3. R is not at 2, so we put it at 4.

So let's choose ""MICRO"".

But wait, what about the feedback? We might get more information.

Another candidate: ""PUCKS"" has U, C, K, S. But no R? We must include R.

So I think ""MICRO"" is a good choice.

Therefore, our second guess is ""MICRO"".

But let me confirm: 
- We are including C and R, which we know are in the word.
- We are avoiding A, N, E.
- We are using new positions for C (position 3) and R (position 4).
- We are testing new letters: M, I, O.

So, we guess ""MICRO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked as wrong position).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked as wrong position).
- A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked as absent).

For the second guess:
- Must include C and R (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoid A, N, E (since they are absent).
- Place C in a new position (not 1) and R in a new position (not 2) to test different locations.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain.

The word ""micro"" fits these criteria:
- Contains C (position 3) and R (position 4), both in new positions.
- Avoids A, N, E.
- Introduces new letters: M, I, O (common vowels/consonants not yet tested).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of C and R while testing three additional letters.",Guess 2: micro -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(-) C(-) R(-) O(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,lyric,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: (-) meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- R: (-) meaning R is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the secret word.
- N: (x) meaning N is not in the secret word.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters C and R, but not in the first and second positions (since in ""crane"", C is at position 1 and R at position 2, and they are marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain A, N, or E.

We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes C and R (since they are in the secret word).
- Does not include A, N, E.
- We should try to place C and R in different positions than the first guess (because in the first guess, they were in positions 1 and 2 and that was wrong).

In the first guess, C was at position 1 and R at position 2. Since they are in the word but not in those positions, we can try placing C in positions 2,3,4,5 and R in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not position 2 because that was already tried and was wrong? Actually, note: the feedback doesn't tell us that they can't be in other positions, but we know that the positions we tried (1 for C and 2 for R) are incorrect for those letters).

We also want to avoid the letters A, N, E.

We should try to use other common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that have C and R, and avoid A, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, H, I, L, O, S, T, U, etc.

We can try to put C and R in new positions. For example, let's try to put R in the first position and C in the third? Or R in the third and C in the fourth? We have flexibility.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- We could try ""ROCKS"" but that has O and S which we don't know about, but also K and S. However, note that we have to avoid A, N, E. But ""ROCKS"" has O, which is allowed? Yes, because we haven't ruled out O.

But wait: we have to consider that the feedback for the first guess only ruled out A, N, E. So O, S, T, etc. are still possible.

However, we have two letters we must include: C and R.

Let me list some words that contain both C and R, without A, N, E.

Examples:
- ""CROWD"" -> C at 1, R at 2? But in the first guess, we had C at 1 and R at 2 and they were wrong. So we should avoid putting C at 1 and R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know that position 1 is not C and position 2 is not R. So we should try different positions.

We know:
- C cannot be at position 1 (because in ""crane"" it was at 1 and marked wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not at position 1).
- Similarly, R cannot be at position 2 (because in ""crane"" it was at 2 and marked wrong position).

So for our next guess, we should avoid putting C at position 1 and R at position 2.

We can try:
- R at position 1 and C at position 3? Or C at position 4? etc.

Let me think of words that start with R (so R at position 1) and have C somewhere else, but not at position 2? Actually, we can put C at any position except 1? But note: we don't know if C can be at position 2? The feedback only said that position 1 is not C. Similarly, position 2 is not R, but R can be at other positions.

So possible words:

- ""R"" at position 1 and ""C"" at position 3: words like ""TRICK"" but T is allowed? But we don't have T in the word yet. However, ""TRICK"" has T, R, I, C, K. But note: we must avoid A, N, E. So ""TRICK"" is okay.

But we also want to cover more new letters. We have only used C, R, A, N, E. So we have 21 letters left to try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and C at position 4? Or position 5?

Another idea: ""CRISP"" but that has C at 1 and R at 2, which we know are wrong positions for C and R respectively. So we avoid that.

We can try ""PORCH"": 
- P, O, R, C, H. 
- R is at position 3, C at position 4. 
- This avoids putting C at 1 and R at 2. 
- Also, no A, N, E.

But we don't know if O, P, H are in the word.

Another word: ""CRUSH"" but again, C at 1 and R at 2, which we know are wrong.

We need to move R and C to different positions.

How about ""SCRUB""? That's 5 letters? S, C, R, U, B -> positions: S(1), C(2), R(3). 
But note: we know that position 2 is not R? Actually, we know that in the first guess, position 2 was R and it was wrong. But in this word, position 2 is C. Is that okay? We don't have a restriction on C at position 2? Only that C cannot be at position 1. So C at position 2 is allowed? We don't know yet.

Similarly, we can have R at position 3? That's allowed because we only know that position 2 is not R.

So ""SCRUB"" is a candidate: S, C, R, U, B.

But let me check: we have S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.

We haven't tried S, U, B. And we are including C and R.

Another candidate: ""TRACE"" but we cannot use E (because E is ruled out) and also A is ruled out? Wait, in ""TRACE"", there is A and E, which are both ruled out. So we cannot use ""TRACE"".

How about ""CRWTH""? Not common.

Another: ""BIRCH"" -> B, I, R, C, H. 
- R is at position 3, C at position 4. 
- Avoids A, N, E.

But we have to consider the positions: we are putting R at 3 and C at 4. That's new.

We can also consider ""DICER"" but E is ruled out.

So ""BIRCH"" seems good.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another idea: ""SHOCK"" -> S, H, O, C, K. 
- C is at position 4. 
- But does it have R? No, we must include R because we know R is in the word. So we cannot omit R.

So we must have both C and R.

Let me try to list words with C and R, without A, N, E, and with R not at position 2 and C not at position 1.

Possible words:
- ""PORCH"" (P, O, R, C, H) -> R at 3, C at 4.
- ""BIRCH"" (B, I, R, C, H) -> R at 3, C at 4.
- ""CRISP"" is invalid because C at 1 and R at 2.
- ""CROWD"" is invalid because C at 1 and R at 2.
- ""ROCKY"" (R, O, C, K, Y) -> R at 1, C at 3. This is good because R is at 1 (which is not position 2) and C at 3 (which is not position 1). Also, no A, N, E.

""ROCKY"" is a valid word.

Another: ""CRUMB"" -> C at 1 and R at 2: invalid.

""SCRAP"" -> has A (ruled out) and C at 2? But also has A.

""SCREW"" -> S, C, R, E, W -> has E (ruled out).

""SCRUB"" -> S, C, R, U, B -> no A, N, E. 
- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3). 
- We know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting C at position 2. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't know about position 2 for C. Similarly, R is at position 3, which is new.

So ""SCRUB"" is a candidate.

Now, which one to choose? We want to maximize information.

In ""ROCKY"": 
- We are trying R at position 1 (which we haven't tried before) and C at position 3 (we had C at 1 before, now at 3). 
- We are also trying O, K, Y.

In ""SCRUB"": 
- We are trying S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U, B. 
- We are trying more new letters: S, U, B.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try more letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has C and R and also uses common vowels that we haven't tried. We haven't tried I, O, U (since A and E are out). 

The word ""PRICE"" has E, which is out.

""ORCIN"" has N? And N is out.

""BORIC"" -> B, O, R, I, C. 
- R at position 3, C at position 5. 
- Avoids A, N, E.

But ""BORIC"" is a word? It's an adjective relating to or derived from borax. It might be less common.

""RICIN"" has N? And N is out.

Another common word: ""CRISP"" is invalid.

""CRIMP"" -> C at 1, R at 2: invalid.

""ROUCH"" is not common.

""COURT"" -> C at 1, which we know is wrong? But we can avoid C at 1. In ""COURT"", C is at 1, so we shouldn't use that.

""TRUCE"" has E.

""BRICK"" -> B, R, I, C, K. 
- R at position 2? But we know that position 2 is not R (from the first guess). So we cannot put R at position 2. 
- In ""BRICK"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid.

But if we put R at position 1? Then we have ""BRICK"" but with R at 1? That would be ""R"" at 1 and then ... but ""BRICK"" has R at 2.

How about ""R"" at 1 and ""C"" at 4? Like ""RELIC"" but has E.

""RHINO"" has N and O? But N is out.

""ROBOT"" -> R at 1, but no C? We must include C.

So we need both.

I think ""ROCKY"" and ""SCRUB"" are good candidates.

Let me compare:
- ""ROCKY"": R at 1, O at 2, C at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.
  - We are testing R at position 1 (which is new) and C at position 3 (new). Also, O, K, Y are new.
- ""SCRUB"": S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.
  - We are testing C at position 2 (which we haven't tried for C) and R at position 3 (new). Also, S, U, B are new.

We might get more information from ""SCRUB"" because it has S and U, which are common.

But note: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was wrong. Now, if we put C at position 2, that might be correct? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C and R and also uses a vowel we haven't tried, like I or O or U.

Another candidate: ""OUNCE"" has E? Out.

""CLOUR"" -> C at 1: invalid.

""MICRO"" -> M, I, C, R, O. 
- C at position 3, R at position 4. 
- Avoids A, N, E. 
- Positions: M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5). 
- We haven't tried M, I, O. 
- And we are putting C at 3 and R at 4, which are new positions.

This seems good.

But is ""MICRO"" a valid word? Yes, as in microcomputer, etc.

So now we have:
- ""ROCKY"": R at 1, O at 2, C at 3, K at 4, Y at 5
- ""SCRUB"": S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5
- ""MICRO"": M at 1, I at 2, C at 3, R at 4, O at 5

We want to choose one that maximizes the chance of getting more feedback.

Note: We know the secret word has C and R, and we are trying to find their positions and other letters.

I think ""MICRO"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places C and R in new positions (3 and 4). Also, it tests M, I, O.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more high-frequency letters.

Another word: ""CHOIR"" -> C at 1: invalid.

""CRITH"" is not common.

I think ""MICRO"" is a solid choice.

But wait, in ""MICRO"", we are putting I at position 2. We don't know if I is in the word, but it's a common vowel.

Alternatively, we can use ""PORCH"" which has P, O, R, C, H. R at 3, C at 4.

But ""PORCH"" uses O and H, which are common.

I think I'll go with ""MICRO"" because it tests M and I, which we haven't tried.

But note: we are trying to avoid repeating positions. We know C is not at 1, so we put it at 3. R is not at 2, so we put it at 4.

So let's choose ""MICRO"".

But wait, what about the feedback? We might get more information.

Another candidate: ""PUCKS"" has U, C, K, S. But no R? We must include R.

So I think ""MICRO"" is a good choice.

Therefore, our second guess is ""MICRO"".

But let me confirm: 
- We are including C and R, which we know are in the word.
- We are avoiding A, N, E.
- We are using new positions for C (position 3) and R (position 4).
- We are testing new letters: M, I, O.

So, we guess ""MICRO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked as wrong position).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked as wrong position).
- A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked as absent).

For the second guess:
- Must include C and R (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoid A, N, E (since they are absent).
- Place C in a new position (not 1) and R in a new position (not 2) to test different locations.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain.

The word ""micro"" fits these criteria:
- Contains C (position 3) and R (position 4), both in new positions.
- Avoids A, N, E.
- Introduces new letters: M, I, O (common vowels/consonants not yet tested).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of C and R while testing three additional letters.

Or C at position 4? etc.\n\nLet me think of words that start with R (so R at position 1) and have C somewhere else, but not at position 2? Actually, we can put C at any position except 1? But note: we don\'t know if C can be at position 2? The feedback only said that position 1 is not C. Similarly, position 2 is not R, but R can be at other positions.\n\nSo possible words:\n\n- ""R"" at position 1 and ""C"" at position 3: words like ""TRICK"" but T is allowed? But we don\'t have T in the word yet. However, ""TRICK"" has T, R, I, C, K. But note: we must avoid A, N, E. So ""TRICK"" is okay.\n\nBut we also want to cover more new letters. We have only used C, R, A, N, E. So we have 21 letters left to try.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and C at position 4? Or position 5?\n\nAnother idea: ""CRISP"" but that has C at 1 and R at 2, which we know are wrong positions for C and R respectively. So we avoid that.\n\nWe can try ""PORCH"": \n- P, O, R, C, H. \n- R is at position 3, C at position 4. \n- This avoids putting C at 1 and R at 2. \n- Also, no A, N, E.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O, P, H are in the word.\n\nAnother word: ""CRUSH"" but again, C at 1 and R at 2, which we know are wrong.\n\nWe need to move R and C to different positions.\n\nHow about ""SCRUB""? That\'s 5 letters? S, C, R, U, B -> positions: S(1), C(2), R(3). \nBut note: we know that position 2 is not R? Actually, we know that in the first guess, position 2 was R and it was wrong. But in this word, position 2 is C. Is that okay? We don\'t have a restriction on C at position 2? Only that C cannot be at position 1. So C at position 2 is allowed? We don\'t know yet.\n\nSimilarly, we can have R at position 3? That\'s allowed because we only know that position 2 is not R.\n\nSo ""SCRUB"" is a candidate: S, C, R, U, B.\n\nBut let me check: we have S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.\n\nWe haven\'t tried S, U, B. And we are including C and R.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TRACE"" but we cannot use E (because E is ruled out) and also A is ruled out? Wait, in ""TRACE"", there is A and E, which are both ruled out. So we cannot use ""TRACE"".\n\nHow about ""CRWTH""? Not common.\n\nAnother: ""BIRCH"" -> B, I, R, C, H. \n- R is at position 3, C at position 4. \n- Avoids A, N, E.\n\nBut we have to consider the positions: we are putting R at 3 and C at 4. That\'s new.\n\nWe can also consider ""DICER"" but E is ruled out.\n\nSo ""BIRCH"" seems good.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""SHOCK"" -> S, H, O, C, K. \n- C is at position 4. \n- But does it have R? No, we must include R because we know R is in the word. So we cannot omit R.\n\nSo we must have both C and R.\n\nLet me try to list words with C and R, without A, N, E, and with R not at position 2 and C not at position 1.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""PORCH"" (P, O, R, C, H) -> R at 3, C at 4.\n- ""BIRCH"" (B, I, R, C, H) -> R at 3, C at 4.\n- ""CRISP"" is invalid because C at 1 and R at 2.\n- ""CROWD"" is invalid because C at 1 and R at 2.\n- ""ROCKY"" (R, O, C, K, Y) -> R at 1, C at 3. This is good because R is at 1 (which is not position 2) and C at 3 (which is not position 1). Also, no A, N, E.\n\n""ROCKY"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""CRUMB"" -> C at 1 and R at 2: invalid.\n\n""SCRAP"" -> has A (ruled out) and C at 2? But also has A.\n\n""SCREW"" -> S, C, R, E, W -> has E (ruled out).\n\n""SCRUB"" -> S, C, R, U, B -> no A, N, E. \n- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3). \n- We know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting C at position 2. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don\'t know about position 2 for C. Similarly, R is at position 3, which is new.\n\nSo ""SCRUB"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to maximize information.\n\nIn ""ROCKY"": \n- We are trying R at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried before) and C at position 3 (we had C at 1 before, now at 3). \n- We are also trying O, K, Y.\n\nIn ""SCRUB"": \n- We are trying S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U, B. \n- We are trying more new letters: S, U, B.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can try more letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has C and R and also uses common vowels that we haven\'t tried. We haven\'t tried I, O, U (since A and E are out). \n\nThe word ""PRICE"" has E, which is out.\n\n""ORCIN"" has N? And N is out.\n\n""BORIC"" -> B, O, R, I, C. \n- R at position 3, C at position 5. \n- Avoids A, N, E.\n\nBut ""BORIC"" is a word? It\'s an adjective relating to or derived from borax. It might be less common.\n\n""RICIN"" has N? And N is out.\n\nAnother common word: ""CRISP"" is invalid.\n\n""CRIMP"" -> C at 1, R at 2: invalid.\n\n""ROUCH"" is not common.\n\n""COURT"" -> C at 1, which we know is wrong? But we can avoid C at 1. In ""COURT"", C is at 1, so we shouldn\'t use that.\n\n""TRUCE"" has E.\n\n""BRICK"" -> B, R, I, C, K. \n- R at position 2? But we know that position 2 is not R (from the first guess). So we cannot put R at position 2. \n- In ""BRICK"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid.\n\nBut if we put R at position 1? Then we have ""BRICK"" but with R at 1? That would be ""R"" at 1 and then ... but ""BRICK"" has R at 2.\n\nHow about ""R"" at 1 and ""C"" at 4? Like ""RELIC"" but has E.\n\n""RHINO"" has N and O? But N is out.\n\n""ROBOT"" -> R at 1, but no C? We must include C.\n\nSo we need both.\n\nI think ""ROCKY"" and ""SCRUB"" are good candidates.\n\nLet me compare:\n- ""ROCKY"": R at 1, O at 2, C at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.\n  - We are testing R at position 1 (which is new) and C at position 3 (new). Also, O, K, Y are new.\n- ""SCRUB"": S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.\n  - We are testing C at position 2 (which we haven\'t tried for C) and R at position 3 (new). Also, S, U, B are new.\n\nWe might get more information from ""SCRUB"" because it has S and U, which are common.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was wrong. Now, if we put C at position 2, that might be correct? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has C and R and also uses a vowel we haven\'t tried, like I or O or U.\n\nAnother candidate: ""OUNCE"" has E? Out.\n\n""CLOUR"" -> C at 1: invalid.\n\n""MICRO"" -> M, I, C, R, O. \n- C at position 3, R at position 4. \n- Avoids A, N, E. \n- Positions: M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5). \n- We haven\'t tried M, I, O. \n- And we are putting C at 3 and R at 4, which are new positions.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nBut is ""MICRO"" a valid word? Yes, as in microcomputer, etc.\n\nSo now we have:\n- ""ROCKY"": R at 1, O at 2, C at 3, K at 4, Y at 5\n- ""SCRUB"": S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5\n- ""MICRO"": M at 1, I at 2, C at 3, R at 4, O at 5\n\nWe want to choose one that maximizes the chance of getting more feedback.\n\nNote: We know the secret word has C and R, and we are trying to find their positions and other letters.\n\nI think ""MICRO"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places C and R in new positions (3 and 4). Also, it tests M, I, O.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses more high-frequency letters.\n\nAnother word: ""CHOIR"" -> C at 1: invalid.\n\n""CRITH"" is not common.\n\nI think ""MICRO"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut wait, in ""MICRO"", we are putting I at position 2. We don\'t know if I is in the word, but it\'s a common vowel.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""PORCH"" which has P, O, R, C, H. R at 3, C at 4.\n\nBut ""PORCH"" uses O and H, which are common.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""MICRO"" because it tests M and I, which we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut note: we are trying to avoid repeating positions. We know C is not at 1, so we put it at 3. R is not at 2, so we put it at 4.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""MICRO"".\n\nBut wait, what about the feedback? We might get more information.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PUCKS"" has U, C, K, S. But no R? We must include R.\n\nSo I think ""MICRO"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, our second guess is ""MICRO"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- We are including C and R, which we know are in the word.\n- We are avoiding A, N, E.\n- We are using new positions for C (position 3) and R (position 4).\n- We are testing new letters: M, I, O.\n\nSo, we guess ""MICRO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked as wrong position).\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked as wrong position).\n- A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked as absent).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must include C and R (since they are confirmed in the word).\n- Avoid A, N, E (since they are absent).\n- Place C in a new position (not 1) and R in a new position (not 2) to test different locations.\n- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain.\n\nThe word ""micro"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains C (position 3) and R (position 4), both in new positions.\n- Avoids A, N, E.\n- Introduces new letters: M, I, O (common vowels/consonants not yet tested).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of C and R while testing three additional letters.\n\n<guess>micro</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: micro -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(-) C(-) R(-) O(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the second guess ""micro"":
- M: (x) meaning M is not in the secret word.
- I: (-) meaning I is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- C: (-) meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position (we already knew C was in the word, but now we know position 3 is also wrong for C).
- R: (-) meaning R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (we already knew R was in the word, but now we know position 4 is also wrong for R).
- O: (x) meaning O is not in the secret word.

So, to summarize what we know:
- The secret word contains the letters: C, R, and I (since I is now confirmed to be in the word, but not in position 2).
- The secret word does not contain: A, N, E, M, O (from both guesses).
- Positions:
  - C is not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess).
  - R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess).
  - I is not in position 2 (from second guess).

We have 6 tries and this is our third guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes C, R, and I (since they are in the secret word).
- Does not include A, N, E, M, O.
- We must place C, R, and I in positions that haven't been ruled out.

Let's list the possible positions for each letter:

For C:
- Cannot be in position 1 or 3.
- So possible positions: 2, 4, 5.

For R:
- Cannot be in position 2 or 4.
- So possible positions: 1, 3, 5.

For I:
- Cannot be in position 2.
- So possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.

We also need to avoid the letters A, N, E, M, O.

We should try to use other common letters to maximize information. The remaining letters we haven't tried include: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We have to form a word that has C, R, I and two other letters from the available set, and assign them to positions that are allowed.

We also note that the positions for C, R, I must be consistent with the constraints.

Let's think of words that have C, R, I and avoid A, N, E, M, O.

Possible words:

- ""PRICE"": but has E (ruled out) and P, R, I, C, E -> E is not allowed.
- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> no A, N, E, M, O. 
  - Let's check positions: 
    - R is at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2. In ""BRICK"", R is at position 2 -> invalid position for R.
- ""TRICK"": T, R, I, C, K -> no forbidden letters. 
  - Positions: T(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5). 
  - But R is at position 2 -> invalid (we know R cannot be at position 2). So not allowed.
- ""CRISP"": C, R, I, S, P -> but C is at position 1 (invalid) and R at position 2 (invalid). Also, we have S and P which are allowed, but positions are bad.

We need to avoid having R at position 2 and C at position 1.

How about ""CIRCA""? But has A (ruled out) and C at position 1.

Another idea: ""URBIC"" is not a common word.

""RICIN"" has N? N is ruled out.

""CLIPT"" is not common.

We need to place R in position 1, 3, or 5 and C in 2, 4, or 5.

Let me try to think of words where R is at position 1 and I is at position 3 or 4, and C at position 4 or 5.

For example:
- ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 3, ""C"" at 4: like ""R?I C?"" -> e.g., ""RIVIC"" not a word.
- ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 4, ""C"" at 5: ""R? ?I C"" -> e.g., ""RUSIC"" not a word.

How about ""R"" at 3, ""I"" at 1, and ""C"" at 5? 
- ""I ? R ? C"" -> e.g., ""I R ? C"" at the end.

Word: ""DIRTY"" but has D, I, R, T, Y -> but no C? We must have C.

We need C in the word.

Another possibility: ""C"" at 2, ""R"" at 3, ""I"" at 4? But we have to avoid R at position 2? No, R at position 3 is allowed.

But we also have to avoid C at position 1, which we are by putting C at 2.

For example, ""SCRIB"": S, C, R, I, B -> 
- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3), I(4), B(5). 
- This uses S, C, R, I, B. 
- Avoids A, N, E, M, O. 
- Now, check the constraints:
  - C is at position 2: we don't have any constraint against C at 2? Only that it cannot be at 1 or 3. So position 2 is allowed.
  - R is at position 3: we know R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is allowed.
  - I is at position 4: we know I cannot be at 2, but 4 is allowed.

So ""SCRIB"" is a valid candidate? But is ""SCRIB"" a word? It might be an abbreviation, but in Wordle, we need valid words. ""SCRIB"" is not a common word. The word ""SCRIBE"" has E, which is out.

Another word: ""PRICY"": P, R, I, C, Y -> 
- Positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), Y(5). 
- But R is at position 2 -> invalid (we know R cannot be at position 2).

""CRITH"" is not common.

""BIRCH"": B, I, R, C, H -> 
- Positions: B(1), I(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). 
- But I is at position 2: we know I cannot be at position 2 (from the feedback of ""micro"", I was at position 2 and marked wrong position). So I cannot be at position 2. Therefore, ""BIRCH"" is invalid because I is at position 2.

We must avoid putting I at position 2.

In ""SCRIB"", I is at position 4, which is okay.

But ""SCRIB"" might not be valid. Let me think of alternatives.

Another word: ""FRITZ"" has Z, but no C? We need C.

""CRICK"": C at 1 -> invalid.

""R"" at 1, ""C"" at 5, and ""I"" at 3: for example, ""R I ? ? C"" -> ""RIVIC"" not a word.

""R"" at 5, ""C"" at 2, ""I"" at 1: ""I ? C ? R"" -> e.g., ""I C ? ? R""

Word: ""ICKER"" not a word.

How about ""PICKY"": but no R.

We need R.

Another idea: ""C"" at 4, ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 3: ""R ? I C ?"" -> e.g., ""R U I C K"" -> ""RUICK"" not a word.

""QUICK"" has Q, U, I, C, K -> but Q and U are allowed? We haven't ruled out Q and U. But ""QUICK"" doesn't have R? We must have R.

So not.

""CRIMP"" has C at 1 and R at 2: invalid.

""SCRIP"": S, C, R, I, P -> 
- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). 
- This is similar to ""SCRIB"" but with P instead of B. 
- ""SCRIP"" is a valid word (meaning a small piece or a writing). 
- Check constraints:
  - C at 2: allowed (not 1 or 3)
  - R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 4)
  - I at 4: allowed (not 2)

And avoids A, N, E, M, O.

So ""SCRIP"" is a good candidate.

Another candidate: ""STRIP"" -> S, T, R, I, P -> but no C? We must have C.

""SCRIM"" has M? M is ruled out.

""CRISP"" is invalid.

""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> 
- Positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5). 
- But R at position 2 is invalid.

So not.

""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> 
- Positions: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5). 
- But R at position 2 is invalid.

Unless we can move R to a different position? But in ""BRISK"", R is fixed at 2.

How about ""FICUS"" has U, S, but no R.

I think ""SCRIP"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word with R at position 1.

For example, ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 3, ""C"" at 5: ""R ? I ? C"" -> e.g., ""R D I C K"" -> ""R DICK"" not a word. Or ""R U I C K"" not a word.

""R"" at 1, ""C"" at 3, ""I"" at 4: ""R ? C I ?"" -> e.g., ""R O C I S"" but O is out. ""R U C I D"" has D, but U, C, I, D -> ""RUCID"" not a word.

""R"" at 5, ""C"" at 2, ""I"" at 1: ""I ? C ? R"" -> e.g., ""I S C U R"" -> ""ISCUR"" not a word.

""R"" at 3, ""C"" at 5, ""I"" at 1: ""I ? R ? C"" -> e.g., ""I T R U C"" -> ""ITRUC"" not a word. Or ""I B R I C"" has two I's? Not allowed? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but we haven't seen any duplicate yet, so we can assume no duplicates? Actually, we don't know, but to be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now.

But in ""SCRIP"", all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""CURIO"" has O and U, but O is out.

""GUILD"" no C or R.

I think ""SCRIP"" is a valid and good choice.

But let me confirm the word: ""scrip"" is accepted in Wordle as a valid guess.

So we'll go with ""SCRIP"".

Therefore, our third guess is ""SCRIP"".

But note: we are putting C at position 2 and R at position 3. We know that in the secret word, C is not at 1 or 3, so position 2 is possible. R is not at 2 or 4, so position 3 is possible. I is at position 4, which is allowed.

We are also testing S and P.

So, we guess ""SCRIP"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - C and R are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, respectively.  
  - A, N, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: MICRO** → M(x) I(-) C(-) R(-) O(x)  
  - I is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - M and O are absent.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: C, R, I (must be included).  
- **Absent letters**: A, E, M, N, O (cannot be used).  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - C: Cannot be in position 1 or 3 (possible: 2, 4, 5).  
  - R: Cannot be in position 2 or 4 (possible: 1, 3, 5).  
  - I: Cannot be in position 2 (possible: 1, 3, 4, 5).  
- **Goal for next guess**:  
  - Include C, R, I in valid positions.  
  - Avoid absent letters (A, E, M, N, O).  
  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, P, B, T, U) to maximize information.  

### Analysis for Guess 3:
After evaluating possible words that fit the constraints (e.g., ""SCRIP"", ""BRICK"", ""TRICK""), ""SCRIP"" was selected because:  
- It places C at position 2 (allowed, as C cannot be in 1 or 3).  
- It places R at position 3 (allowed, as R cannot be in 2 or 4).  
- It places I at position 4 (allowed, as I cannot be in 2).  
- It uses new letters S and P (common consonants not yet tested).  
- It avoids all absent letters (A, E, M, N, O).  

This guess will help verify the positions of C, R, I while testing S and P for presence/position.

<guess>scrip</guess>",scrip,"We are given feedback for the second guess ""micro"":
- M: (x) meaning M is not in the secret word.
- I: (-) meaning I is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- C: (-) meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position (we already knew C was in the word, but now we know position 3 is also wrong for C).
- R: (-) meaning R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (we already knew R was in the word, but now we know position 4 is also wrong for R).
- O: (x) meaning O is not in the secret word.

So, to summarize what we know:
- The secret word contains the letters: C, R, and I (since I is now confirmed to be in the word, but not in position 2).
- The secret word does not contain: A, N, E, M, O (from both guesses).
- Positions:
  - C is not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess).
  - R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess).
  - I is not in position 2 (from second guess).

We have 6 tries and this is our third guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes C, R, and I (since they are in the secret word).
- Does not include A, N, E, M, O.
- We must place C, R, and I in positions that haven't been ruled out.

Let's list the possible positions for each letter:

For C:
- Cannot be in position 1 or 3.
- So possible positions: 2, 4, 5.

For R:
- Cannot be in position 2 or 4.
- So possible positions: 1, 3, 5.

For I:
- Cannot be in position 2.
- So possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.

We also need to avoid the letters A, N, E, M, O.

We should try to use other common letters to maximize information. The remaining letters we haven't tried include: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We have to form a word that has C, R, I and two other letters from the available set, and assign them to positions that are allowed.

We also note that the positions for C, R, I must be consistent with the constraints.

Let's think of words that have C, R, I and avoid A, N, E, M, O.

Possible words:

- ""PRICE"": but has E (ruled out) and P, R, I, C, E -> E is not allowed.
- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> no A, N, E, M, O. 
  - Let's check positions: 
    - R is at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2. In ""BRICK"", R is at position 2 -> invalid position for R.
- ""TRICK"": T, R, I, C, K -> no forbidden letters. 
  - Positions: T(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5). 
  - But R is at position 2 -> invalid (we know R cannot be at position 2). So not allowed.
- ""CRISP"": C, R, I, S, P -> but C is at position 1 (invalid) and R at position 2 (invalid). Also, we have S and P which are allowed, but positions are bad.

We need to avoid having R at position 2 and C at position 1.

How about ""CIRCA""? But has A (ruled out) and C at position 1.

Another idea: ""URBIC"" is not a common word.

""RICIN"" has N? N is ruled out.

""CLIPT"" is not common.

We need to place R in position 1, 3, or 5 and C in 2, 4, or 5.

Let me try to think of words where R is at position 1 and I is at position 3 or 4, and C at position 4 or 5.

For example:
- ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 3, ""C"" at 4: like ""R?I C?"" -> e.g., ""RIVIC"" not a word.
- ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 4, ""C"" at 5: ""R? ?I C"" -> e.g., ""RUSIC"" not a word.

How about ""R"" at 3, ""I"" at 1, and ""C"" at 5? 
- ""I ? R ? C"" -> e.g., ""I R ? C"" at the end.

Word: ""DIRTY"" but has D, I, R, T, Y -> but no C? We must have C.

We need C in the word.

Another possibility: ""C"" at 2, ""R"" at 3, ""I"" at 4? But we have to avoid R at position 2? No, R at position 3 is allowed.

But we also have to avoid C at position 1, which we are by putting C at 2.

For example, ""SCRIB"": S, C, R, I, B -> 
- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3), I(4), B(5). 
- This uses S, C, R, I, B. 
- Avoids A, N, E, M, O. 
- Now, check the constraints:
  - C is at position 2: we don't have any constraint against C at 2? Only that it cannot be at 1 or 3. So position 2 is allowed.
  - R is at position 3: we know R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is allowed.
  - I is at position 4: we know I cannot be at 2, but 4 is allowed.

So ""SCRIB"" is a valid candidate? But is ""SCRIB"" a word? It might be an abbreviation, but in Wordle, we need valid words. ""SCRIB"" is not a common word. The word ""SCRIBE"" has E, which is out.

Another word: ""PRICY"": P, R, I, C, Y -> 
- Positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), Y(5). 
- But R is at position 2 -> invalid (we know R cannot be at position 2).

""CRITH"" is not common.

""BIRCH"": B, I, R, C, H -> 
- Positions: B(1), I(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). 
- But I is at position 2: we know I cannot be at position 2 (from the feedback of ""micro"", I was at position 2 and marked wrong position). So I cannot be at position 2. Therefore, ""BIRCH"" is invalid because I is at position 2.

We must avoid putting I at position 2.

In ""SCRIB"", I is at position 4, which is okay.

But ""SCRIB"" might not be valid. Let me think of alternatives.

Another word: ""FRITZ"" has Z, but no C? We need C.

""CRICK"": C at 1 -> invalid.

""R"" at 1, ""C"" at 5, and ""I"" at 3: for example, ""R I ? ? C"" -> ""RIVIC"" not a word.

""R"" at 5, ""C"" at 2, ""I"" at 1: ""I ? C ? R"" -> e.g., ""I C ? ? R""

Word: ""ICKER"" not a word.

How about ""PICKY"": but no R.

We need R.

Another idea: ""C"" at 4, ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 3: ""R ? I C ?"" -> e.g., ""R U I C K"" -> ""RUICK"" not a word.

""QUICK"" has Q, U, I, C, K -> but Q and U are allowed? We haven't ruled out Q and U. But ""QUICK"" doesn't have R? We must have R.

So not.

""CRIMP"" has C at 1 and R at 2: invalid.

""SCRIP"": S, C, R, I, P -> 
- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). 
- This is similar to ""SCRIB"" but with P instead of B. 
- ""SCRIP"" is a valid word (meaning a small piece or a writing). 
- Check constraints:
  - C at 2: allowed (not 1 or 3)
  - R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 4)
  - I at 4: allowed (not 2)

And avoids A, N, E, M, O.

So ""SCRIP"" is a good candidate.

Another candidate: ""STRIP"" -> S, T, R, I, P -> but no C? We must have C.

""SCRIM"" has M? M is ruled out.

""CRISP"" is invalid.

""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> 
- Positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5). 
- But R at position 2 is invalid.

So not.

""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> 
- Positions: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5). 
- But R at position 2 is invalid.

Unless we can move R to a different position? But in ""BRISK"", R is fixed at 2.

How about ""FICUS"" has U, S, but no R.

I think ""SCRIP"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word with R at position 1.

For example, ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 3, ""C"" at 5: ""R ? I ? C"" -> e.g., ""R D I C K"" -> ""R DICK"" not a word. Or ""R U I C K"" not a word.

""R"" at 1, ""C"" at 3, ""I"" at 4: ""R ? C I ?"" -> e.g., ""R O C I S"" but O is out. ""R U C I D"" has D, but U, C, I, D -> ""RUCID"" not a word.

""R"" at 5, ""C"" at 2, ""I"" at 1: ""I ? C ? R"" -> e.g., ""I S C U R"" -> ""ISCUR"" not a word.

""R"" at 3, ""C"" at 5, ""I"" at 1: ""I ? R ? C"" -> e.g., ""I T R U C"" -> ""ITRUC"" not a word. Or ""I B R I C"" has two I's? Not allowed? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but we haven't seen any duplicate yet, so we can assume no duplicates? Actually, we don't know, but to be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now.

But in ""SCRIP"", all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""CURIO"" has O and U, but O is out.

""GUILD"" no C or R.

I think ""SCRIP"" is a valid and good choice.

But let me confirm the word: ""scrip"" is accepted in Wordle as a valid guess.

So we'll go with ""SCRIP"".

Therefore, our third guess is ""SCRIP"".

But note: we are putting C at position 2 and R at position 3. We know that in the secret word, C is not at 1 or 3, so position 2 is possible. R is not at 2 or 4, so position 3 is possible. I is at position 4, which is allowed.

We are also testing S and P.

So, we guess ""SCRIP"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - C and R are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, respectively.  
  - A, N, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: MICRO** → M(x) I(-) C(-) R(-) O(x)  
  - I is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - M and O are absent.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: C, R, I (must be included).  
- **Absent letters**: A, E, M, N, O (cannot be used).  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - C: Cannot be in position 1 or 3 (possible: 2, 4, 5).  
  - R: Cannot be in position 2 or 4 (possible: 1, 3, 5).  
  - I: Cannot be in position 2 (possible: 1, 3, 4, 5).  
- **Goal for next guess**:  
  - Include C, R, I in valid positions.  
  - Avoid absent letters (A, E, M, N, O).  
  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, P, B, T, U) to maximize information.  

### Analysis for Guess 3:
After evaluating possible words that fit the constraints (e.g., ""SCRIP"", ""BRICK"", ""TRICK""), ""SCRIP"" was selected because:  
- It places C at position 2 (allowed, as C cannot be in 1 or 3).  
- It places R at position 3 (allowed, as R cannot be in 2 or 4).  
- It places I at position 4 (allowed, as I cannot be in 2).  
- It uses new letters S and P (common consonants not yet tested).  
- It avoids all absent letters (A, E, M, N, O).  

This guess will help verify the positions of C, R, I while testing S and P for presence/position.",Guess 3: scrip -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) R(✓) I(✓) P(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,lyric,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all frequent in English words.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: (-) meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- R: (-) meaning R is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- A: (x) meaning A is not in the secret word.
- N: (x) meaning N is not in the secret word.
- E: (x) meaning E is not in the secret word.

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters C and R, but not in the first and second positions (since in ""crane"", C is at position 1 and R at position 2, and they are marked as wrong position).
- The secret word does not contain A, N, or E.

We have 6 tries and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes C and R (since they are in the secret word).
- Does not include A, N, E.
- We should try to place C and R in different positions than the first guess (because in the first guess, they were in positions 1 and 2 and that was wrong).

In the first guess, C was at position 1 and R at position 2. Since they are in the word but not in those positions, we can try placing C in positions 2,3,4,5 and R in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not position 2 because that was already tried and was wrong? Actually, note: the feedback doesn't tell us that they can't be in other positions, but we know that the positions we tried (1 for C and 2 for R) are incorrect for those letters).

We also want to avoid the letters A, N, E.

We should try to use other common letters to maximize information.

Let's think of words that have C and R, and avoid A, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, H, I, L, O, S, T, U, etc.

We can try to put C and R in new positions. For example, let's try to put R in the first position and C in the third? Or R in the third and C in the fourth? We have flexibility.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- We could try ""ROCKS"" but that has O and S which we don't know about, but also K and S. However, note that we have to avoid A, N, E. But ""ROCKS"" has O, which is allowed? Yes, because we haven't ruled out O.

But wait: we have to consider that the feedback for the first guess only ruled out A, N, E. So O, S, T, etc. are still possible.

However, we have two letters we must include: C and R.

Let me list some words that contain both C and R, without A, N, E.

Examples:
- ""CROWD"" -> C at 1, R at 2? But in the first guess, we had C at 1 and R at 2 and they were wrong. So we should avoid putting C at 1 and R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know that position 1 is not C and position 2 is not R. So we should try different positions.

We know:
- C cannot be at position 1 (because in ""crane"" it was at 1 and marked wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not at position 1).
- Similarly, R cannot be at position 2 (because in ""crane"" it was at 2 and marked wrong position).

So for our next guess, we should avoid putting C at position 1 and R at position 2.

We can try:
- R at position 1 and C at position 3? Or C at position 4? etc.

Let me think of words that start with R (so R at position 1) and have C somewhere else, but not at position 2? Actually, we can put C at any position except 1? But note: we don't know if C can be at position 2? The feedback only said that position 1 is not C. Similarly, position 2 is not R, but R can be at other positions.

So possible words:

- ""R"" at position 1 and ""C"" at position 3: words like ""TRICK"" but T is allowed? But we don't have T in the word yet. However, ""TRICK"" has T, R, I, C, K. But note: we must avoid A, N, E. So ""TRICK"" is okay.

But we also want to cover more new letters. We have only used C, R, A, N, E. So we have 21 letters left to try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and C at position 4? Or position 5?

Another idea: ""CRISP"" but that has C at 1 and R at 2, which we know are wrong positions for C and R respectively. So we avoid that.

We can try ""PORCH"": 
- P, O, R, C, H. 
- R is at position 3, C at position 4. 
- This avoids putting C at 1 and R at 2. 
- Also, no A, N, E.

But we don't know if O, P, H are in the word.

Another word: ""CRUSH"" but again, C at 1 and R at 2, which we know are wrong.

We need to move R and C to different positions.

How about ""SCRUB""? That's 5 letters? S, C, R, U, B -> positions: S(1), C(2), R(3). 
But note: we know that position 2 is not R? Actually, we know that in the first guess, position 2 was R and it was wrong. But in this word, position 2 is C. Is that okay? We don't have a restriction on C at position 2? Only that C cannot be at position 1. So C at position 2 is allowed? We don't know yet.

Similarly, we can have R at position 3? That's allowed because we only know that position 2 is not R.

So ""SCRUB"" is a candidate: S, C, R, U, B.

But let me check: we have S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.

We haven't tried S, U, B. And we are including C and R.

Another candidate: ""TRACE"" but we cannot use E (because E is ruled out) and also A is ruled out? Wait, in ""TRACE"", there is A and E, which are both ruled out. So we cannot use ""TRACE"".

How about ""CRWTH""? Not common.

Another: ""BIRCH"" -> B, I, R, C, H. 
- R is at position 3, C at position 4. 
- Avoids A, N, E.

But we have to consider the positions: we are putting R at 3 and C at 4. That's new.

We can also consider ""DICER"" but E is ruled out.

So ""BIRCH"" seems good.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.

Another idea: ""SHOCK"" -> S, H, O, C, K. 
- C is at position 4. 
- But does it have R? No, we must include R because we know R is in the word. So we cannot omit R.

So we must have both C and R.

Let me try to list words with C and R, without A, N, E, and with R not at position 2 and C not at position 1.

Possible words:
- ""PORCH"" (P, O, R, C, H) -> R at 3, C at 4.
- ""BIRCH"" (B, I, R, C, H) -> R at 3, C at 4.
- ""CRISP"" is invalid because C at 1 and R at 2.
- ""CROWD"" is invalid because C at 1 and R at 2.
- ""ROCKY"" (R, O, C, K, Y) -> R at 1, C at 3. This is good because R is at 1 (which is not position 2) and C at 3 (which is not position 1). Also, no A, N, E.

""ROCKY"" is a valid word.

Another: ""CRUMB"" -> C at 1 and R at 2: invalid.

""SCRAP"" -> has A (ruled out) and C at 2? But also has A.

""SCREW"" -> S, C, R, E, W -> has E (ruled out).

""SCRUB"" -> S, C, R, U, B -> no A, N, E. 
- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3). 
- We know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting C at position 2. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don't know about position 2 for C. Similarly, R is at position 3, which is new.

So ""SCRUB"" is a candidate.

Now, which one to choose? We want to maximize information.

In ""ROCKY"": 
- We are trying R at position 1 (which we haven't tried before) and C at position 3 (we had C at 1 before, now at 3). 
- We are also trying O, K, Y.

In ""SCRUB"": 
- We are trying S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U, B. 
- We are trying more new letters: S, U, B.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can try more letters.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has C and R and also uses common vowels that we haven't tried. We haven't tried I, O, U (since A and E are out). 

The word ""PRICE"" has E, which is out.

""ORCIN"" has N? And N is out.

""BORIC"" -> B, O, R, I, C. 
- R at position 3, C at position 5. 
- Avoids A, N, E.

But ""BORIC"" is a word? It's an adjective relating to or derived from borax. It might be less common.

""RICIN"" has N? And N is out.

Another common word: ""CRISP"" is invalid.

""CRIMP"" -> C at 1, R at 2: invalid.

""ROUCH"" is not common.

""COURT"" -> C at 1, which we know is wrong? But we can avoid C at 1. In ""COURT"", C is at 1, so we shouldn't use that.

""TRUCE"" has E.

""BRICK"" -> B, R, I, C, K. 
- R at position 2? But we know that position 2 is not R (from the first guess). So we cannot put R at position 2. 
- In ""BRICK"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid.

But if we put R at position 1? Then we have ""BRICK"" but with R at 1? That would be ""R"" at 1 and then ... but ""BRICK"" has R at 2.

How about ""R"" at 1 and ""C"" at 4? Like ""RELIC"" but has E.

""RHINO"" has N and O? But N is out.

""ROBOT"" -> R at 1, but no C? We must include C.

So we need both.

I think ""ROCKY"" and ""SCRUB"" are good candidates.

Let me compare:
- ""ROCKY"": R at 1, O at 2, C at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.
  - We are testing R at position 1 (which is new) and C at position 3 (new). Also, O, K, Y are new.
- ""SCRUB"": S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.
  - We are testing C at position 2 (which we haven't tried for C) and R at position 3 (new). Also, S, U, B are new.

We might get more information from ""SCRUB"" because it has S and U, which are common.

But note: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was wrong. Now, if we put C at position 2, that might be correct? We don't know.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C and R and also uses a vowel we haven't tried, like I or O or U.

Another candidate: ""OUNCE"" has E? Out.

""CLOUR"" -> C at 1: invalid.

""MICRO"" -> M, I, C, R, O. 
- C at position 3, R at position 4. 
- Avoids A, N, E. 
- Positions: M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5). 
- We haven't tried M, I, O. 
- And we are putting C at 3 and R at 4, which are new positions.

This seems good.

But is ""MICRO"" a valid word? Yes, as in microcomputer, etc.

So now we have:
- ""ROCKY"": R at 1, O at 2, C at 3, K at 4, Y at 5
- ""SCRUB"": S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5
- ""MICRO"": M at 1, I at 2, C at 3, R at 4, O at 5

We want to choose one that maximizes the chance of getting more feedback.

Note: We know the secret word has C and R, and we are trying to find their positions and other letters.

I think ""MICRO"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places C and R in new positions (3 and 4). Also, it tests M, I, O.

But let me see if there is a word that uses more high-frequency letters.

Another word: ""CHOIR"" -> C at 1: invalid.

""CRITH"" is not common.

I think ""MICRO"" is a solid choice.

But wait, in ""MICRO"", we are putting I at position 2. We don't know if I is in the word, but it's a common vowel.

Alternatively, we can use ""PORCH"" which has P, O, R, C, H. R at 3, C at 4.

But ""PORCH"" uses O and H, which are common.

I think I'll go with ""MICRO"" because it tests M and I, which we haven't tried.

But note: we are trying to avoid repeating positions. We know C is not at 1, so we put it at 3. R is not at 2, so we put it at 4.

So let's choose ""MICRO"".

But wait, what about the feedback? We might get more information.

Another candidate: ""PUCKS"" has U, C, K, S. But no R? We must include R.

So I think ""MICRO"" is a good choice.

Therefore, our second guess is ""MICRO"".

But let me confirm: 
- We are including C and R, which we know are in the word.
- We are avoiding A, N, E.
- We are using new positions for C (position 3) and R (position 4).
- We are testing new letters: M, I, O.

So, we guess ""MICRO"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked as wrong position).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (marked as wrong position).
- A, N, and E are not in the secret word (marked as absent).

For the second guess:
- Must include C and R (since they are confirmed in the word).
- Avoid A, N, E (since they are absent).
- Place C in a new position (not 1) and R in a new position (not 2) to test different locations.
- Use new, common letters to maximize information gain.

The word ""micro"" fits these criteria:
- Contains C (position 3) and R (position 4), both in new positions.
- Avoids A, N, E.
- Introduces new letters: M, I, O (common vowels/consonants not yet tested).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of C and R while testing three additional letters.

<guess>micro</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: micro -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(-) C(-) R(-) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the second guess ""micro"":
- M: (x) meaning M is not in the secret word.
- I: (-) meaning I is in the secret word but in the wrong position.
- C: (-) meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position (we already knew C was in the word, but now we know position 3 is also wrong for C).
- R: (-) meaning R is in the secret word but in the wrong position (we already knew R was in the word, but now we know position 4 is also wrong for R).
- O: (x) meaning O is not in the secret word.

So, to summarize what we know:
- The secret word contains the letters: C, R, and I (since I is now confirmed to be in the word, but not in position 2).
- The secret word does not contain: A, N, E, M, O (from both guesses).
- Positions:
  - C is not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess).
  - R is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess).
  - I is not in position 2 (from second guess).

We have 6 tries and this is our third guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes C, R, and I (since they are in the secret word).
- Does not include A, N, E, M, O.
- We must place C, R, and I in positions that haven't been ruled out.

Let's list the possible positions for each letter:

For C:
- Cannot be in position 1 or 3.
- So possible positions: 2, 4, 5.

For R:
- Cannot be in position 2 or 4.
- So possible positions: 1, 3, 5.

For I:
- Cannot be in position 2.
- So possible positions: 1, 3, 4, 5.

We also need to avoid the letters A, N, E, M, O.

We should try to use other common letters to maximize information. The remaining letters we haven't tried include: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, P, S, T, U, W, Y, etc.

We have to form a word that has C, R, I and two other letters from the available set, and assign them to positions that are allowed.

We also note that the positions for C, R, I must be consistent with the constraints.

Let's think of words that have C, R, I and avoid A, N, E, M, O.

Possible words:

- ""PRICE"": but has E (ruled out) and P, R, I, C, E -> E is not allowed.
- ""BRICK"": B, R, I, C, K -> no A, N, E, M, O. 
  - Let's check positions: 
    - R is at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2. In ""BRICK"", R is at position 2 -> invalid position for R.
- ""TRICK"": T, R, I, C, K -> no forbidden letters. 
  - Positions: T(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5). 
  - But R is at position 2 -> invalid (we know R cannot be at position 2). So not allowed.
- ""CRISP"": C, R, I, S, P -> but C is at position 1 (invalid) and R at position 2 (invalid). Also, we have S and P which are allowed, but positions are bad.

We need to avoid having R at position 2 and C at position 1.

How about ""CIRCA""? But has A (ruled out) and C at position 1.

Another idea: ""URBIC"" is not a common word.

""RICIN"" has N? N is ruled out.

""CLIPT"" is not common.

We need to place R in position 1, 3, or 5 and C in 2, 4, or 5.

Let me try to think of words where R is at position 1 and I is at position 3 or 4, and C at position 4 or 5.

For example:
- ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 3, ""C"" at 4: like ""R?I C?"" -> e.g., ""RIVIC"" not a word.
- ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 4, ""C"" at 5: ""R? ?I C"" -> e.g., ""RUSIC"" not a word.

How about ""R"" at 3, ""I"" at 1, and ""C"" at 5? 
- ""I ? R ? C"" -> e.g., ""I R ? C"" at the end.

Word: ""DIRTY"" but has D, I, R, T, Y -> but no C? We must have C.

We need C in the word.

Another possibility: ""C"" at 2, ""R"" at 3, ""I"" at 4? But we have to avoid R at position 2? No, R at position 3 is allowed.

But we also have to avoid C at position 1, which we are by putting C at 2.

For example, ""SCRIB"": S, C, R, I, B -> 
- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3), I(4), B(5). 
- This uses S, C, R, I, B. 
- Avoids A, N, E, M, O. 
- Now, check the constraints:
  - C is at position 2: we don't have any constraint against C at 2? Only that it cannot be at 1 or 3. So position 2 is allowed.
  - R is at position 3: we know R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is allowed.
  - I is at position 4: we know I cannot be at 2, but 4 is allowed.

So ""SCRIB"" is a valid candidate? But is ""SCRIB"" a word? It might be an abbreviation, but in Wordle, we need valid words. ""SCRIB"" is not a common word. The word ""SCRIBE"" has E, which is out.

Another word: ""PRICY"": P, R, I, C, Y -> 
- Positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), Y(5). 
- But R is at position 2 -> invalid (we know R cannot be at position 2).

""CRITH"" is not common.

""BIRCH"": B, I, R, C, H -> 
- Positions: B(1), I(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). 
- But I is at position 2: we know I cannot be at position 2 (from the feedback of ""micro"", I was at position 2 and marked wrong position). So I cannot be at position 2. Therefore, ""BIRCH"" is invalid because I is at position 2.

We must avoid putting I at position 2.

In ""SCRIB"", I is at position 4, which is okay.

But ""SCRIB"" might not be valid. Let me think of alternatives.

Another word: ""FRITZ"" has Z, but no C? We need C.

""CRICK"": C at 1 -> invalid.

""R"" at 1, ""C"" at 5, and ""I"" at 3: for example, ""R I ? ? C"" -> ""RIVIC"" not a word.

""R"" at 5, ""C"" at 2, ""I"" at 1: ""I ? C ? R"" -> e.g., ""I C ? ? R""

Word: ""ICKER"" not a word.

How about ""PICKY"": but no R.

We need R.

Another idea: ""C"" at 4, ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 3: ""R ? I C ?"" -> e.g., ""R U I C K"" -> ""RUICK"" not a word.

""QUICK"" has Q, U, I, C, K -> but Q and U are allowed? We haven't ruled out Q and U. But ""QUICK"" doesn't have R? We must have R.

So not.

""CRIMP"" has C at 1 and R at 2: invalid.

""SCRIP"": S, C, R, I, P -> 
- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). 
- This is similar to ""SCRIB"" but with P instead of B. 
- ""SCRIP"" is a valid word (meaning a small piece or a writing). 
- Check constraints:
  - C at 2: allowed (not 1 or 3)
  - R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 4)
  - I at 4: allowed (not 2)

And avoids A, N, E, M, O.

So ""SCRIP"" is a good candidate.

Another candidate: ""STRIP"" -> S, T, R, I, P -> but no C? We must have C.

""SCRIM"" has M? M is ruled out.

""CRISP"" is invalid.

""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> 
- Positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5). 
- But R at position 2 is invalid.

So not.

""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> 
- Positions: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5). 
- But R at position 2 is invalid.

Unless we can move R to a different position? But in ""BRISK"", R is fixed at 2.

How about ""FICUS"" has U, S, but no R.

I think ""SCRIP"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word with R at position 1.

For example, ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 3, ""C"" at 5: ""R ? I ? C"" -> e.g., ""R D I C K"" -> ""R DICK"" not a word. Or ""R U I C K"" not a word.

""R"" at 1, ""C"" at 3, ""I"" at 4: ""R ? C I ?"" -> e.g., ""R O C I S"" but O is out. ""R U C I D"" has D, but U, C, I, D -> ""RUCID"" not a word.

""R"" at 5, ""C"" at 2, ""I"" at 1: ""I ? C ? R"" -> e.g., ""I S C U R"" -> ""ISCUR"" not a word.

""R"" at 3, ""C"" at 5, ""I"" at 1: ""I ? R ? C"" -> e.g., ""I T R U C"" -> ""ITRUC"" not a word. Or ""I B R I C"" has two I's? Not allowed? We don't know if the word has duplicate letters, but we haven't seen any duplicate yet, so we can assume no duplicates? Actually, we don't know, but to be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now.

But in ""SCRIP"", all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""CURIO"" has O and U, but O is out.

""GUILD"" no C or R.

I think ""SCRIP"" is a valid and good choice.

But let me confirm the word: ""scrip"" is accepted in Wordle as a valid guess.

So we'll go with ""SCRIP"".

Therefore, our third guess is ""SCRIP"".

But note: we are putting C at position 2 and R at position 3. We know that in the secret word, C is not at 1 or 3, so position 2 is possible. R is not at 2 or 4, so position 3 is possible. I is at position 4, which is allowed.

We are also testing S and P.

So, we guess ""SCRIP"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  
  - C and R are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, respectively.  
  - A, N, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: MICRO** → M(x) I(-) C(-) R(-) O(x)  
  - I is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - M and O are absent.  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: C, R, I (must be included).  
- **Absent letters**: A, E, M, N, O (cannot be used).  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - C: Cannot be in position 1 or 3 (possible: 2, 4, 5).  
  - R: Cannot be in position 2 or 4 (possible: 1, 3, 5).  
  - I: Cannot be in position 2 (possible: 1, 3, 4, 5).  
- **Goal for next guess**:  
  - Include C, R, I in valid positions.  
  - Avoid absent letters (A, E, M, N, O).  
  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, P, B, T, U) to maximize information.  

### Analysis for Guess 3:
After evaluating possible words that fit the constraints (e.g., ""SCRIP"", ""BRICK"", ""TRICK""), ""SCRIP"" was selected because:  
- It places C at position 2 (allowed, as C cannot be in 1 or 3).  
- It places R at position 3 (allowed, as R cannot be in 2 or 4).  
- It places I at position 4 (allowed, as I cannot be in 2).  
- It uses new letters S and P (common consonants not yet tested).  
- It avoids all absent letters (A, E, M, N, O).  

This guess will help verify the positions of C, R, I while testing S and P for presence/position.

Since they are in the word but not in those positions, we can try placing C in positions 2,3,4,5 and R in positions 1,3,4,5 (but not position 2 because that was already tried and was wrong? Actually, note: the feedback doesn\'t tell us that they can\'t be in other positions, but we know that the positions we tried (1 for C and 2 for R) are incorrect for those letters).\n\nWe also want to avoid the letters A, N, E.\n\nWe should try to use other common letters to maximize information.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have C and R, and avoid A, N, E.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, H, I, L, O, S, T, U, etc.\n\nWe can try to put C and R in new positions. For example, let\'s try to put R in the first position and C in the third? Or R in the third and C in the fourth? We have flexibility.\n\nWe also note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nPossible words: \n- We could try ""ROCKS"" but that has O and S which we don\'t know about, but also K and S. However, note that we have to avoid A, N, E. But ""ROCKS"" has O, which is allowed? Yes, because we haven\'t ruled out O.\n\nBut wait: we have to consider that the feedback for the first guess only ruled out A, N, E. So O, S, T, etc. are still possible.\n\nHowever, we have two letters we must include: C and R.\n\nLet me list some words that contain both C and R, without A, N, E.\n\nExamples:\n- ""CROWD"" -> C at 1, R at 2? But in the first guess, we had C at 1 and R at 2 and they were wrong. So we should avoid putting C at 1 and R at 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know that position 1 is not C and position 2 is not R. So we should try different positions.\n\nWe know:\n- C cannot be at position 1 (because in ""crane"" it was at 1 and marked wrong position, meaning it is in the word but not at position 1).\n- Similarly, R cannot be at position 2 (because in ""crane"" it was at 2 and marked wrong position).\n\nSo for our next guess, we should avoid putting C at position 1 and R at position 2.\n\nWe can try:\n- R at position 1 and C at position 3? Or C at position 4? etc.\n\nLet me think of words that start with R (so R at position 1) and have C somewhere else, but not at position 2? Actually, we can put C at any position except 1? But note: we don\'t know if C can be at position 2? The feedback only said that position 1 is not C. Similarly, position 2 is not R, but R can be at other positions.\n\nSo possible words:\n\n- ""R"" at position 1 and ""C"" at position 3: words like ""TRICK"" but T is allowed? But we don\'t have T in the word yet. However, ""TRICK"" has T, R, I, C, K. But note: we must avoid A, N, E. So ""TRICK"" is okay.\n\nBut we also want to cover more new letters. We have only used C, R, A, N, E. So we have 21 letters left to try.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R at position 1 and C at position 4? Or position 5?\n\nAnother idea: ""CRISP"" but that has C at 1 and R at 2, which we know are wrong positions for C and R respectively. So we avoid that.\n\nWe can try ""PORCH"": \n- P, O, R, C, H. \n- R is at position 3, C at position 4. \n- This avoids putting C at 1 and R at 2. \n- Also, no A, N, E.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O, P, H are in the word.\n\nAnother word: ""CRUSH"" but again, C at 1 and R at 2, which we know are wrong.\n\nWe need to move R and C to different positions.\n\nHow about ""SCRUB""? That\'s 5 letters? S, C, R, U, B -> positions: S(1), C(2), R(3). \nBut note: we know that position 2 is not R? Actually, we know that in the first guess, position 2 was R and it was wrong. But in this word, position 2 is C. Is that okay? We don\'t have a restriction on C at position 2? Only that C cannot be at position 1. So C at position 2 is allowed? We don\'t know yet.\n\nSimilarly, we can have R at position 3? That\'s allowed because we only know that position 2 is not R.\n\nSo ""SCRUB"" is a candidate: S, C, R, U, B.\n\nBut let me check: we have S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.\n\nWe haven\'t tried S, U, B. And we are including C and R.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TRACE"" but we cannot use E (because E is ruled out) and also A is ruled out? Wait, in ""TRACE"", there is A and E, which are both ruled out. So we cannot use ""TRACE"".\n\nHow about ""CRWTH""? Not common.\n\nAnother: ""BIRCH"" -> B, I, R, C, H. \n- R is at position 3, C at position 4. \n- Avoids A, N, E.\n\nBut we have to consider the positions: we are putting R at 3 and C at 4. That\'s new.\n\nWe can also consider ""DICER"" but E is ruled out.\n\nSo ""BIRCH"" seems good.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""SHOCK"" -> S, H, O, C, K. \n- C is at position 4. \n- But does it have R? No, we must include R because we know R is in the word. So we cannot omit R.\n\nSo we must have both C and R.\n\nLet me try to list words with C and R, without A, N, E, and with R not at position 2 and C not at position 1.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""PORCH"" (P, O, R, C, H) -> R at 3, C at 4.\n- ""BIRCH"" (B, I, R, C, H) -> R at 3, C at 4.\n- ""CRISP"" is invalid because C at 1 and R at 2.\n- ""CROWD"" is invalid because C at 1 and R at 2.\n- ""ROCKY"" (R, O, C, K, Y) -> R at 1, C at 3. This is good because R is at 1 (which is not position 2) and C at 3 (which is not position 1). Also, no A, N, E.\n\n""ROCKY"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""CRUMB"" -> C at 1 and R at 2: invalid.\n\n""SCRAP"" -> has A (ruled out) and C at 2? But also has A.\n\n""SCREW"" -> S, C, R, E, W -> has E (ruled out).\n\n""SCRUB"" -> S, C, R, U, B -> no A, N, E. \n- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3). \n- We know that position 2 was R in the first guess and was wrong, but now we are putting C at position 2. Is that allowed? Yes, because we don\'t know about position 2 for C. Similarly, R is at position 3, which is new.\n\nSo ""SCRUB"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We want to maximize information.\n\nIn ""ROCKY"": \n- We are trying R at position 1 (which we haven\'t tried before) and C at position 3 (we had C at 1 before, now at 3). \n- We are also trying O, K, Y.\n\nIn ""SCRUB"": \n- We are trying S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U, B. \n- We are trying more new letters: S, U, B.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can try more letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has C and R and also uses common vowels that we haven\'t tried. We haven\'t tried I, O, U (since A and E are out). \n\nThe word ""PRICE"" has E, which is out.\n\n""ORCIN"" has N? And N is out.\n\n""BORIC"" -> B, O, R, I, C. \n- R at position 3, C at position 5. \n- Avoids A, N, E.\n\nBut ""BORIC"" is a word? It\'s an adjective relating to or derived from borax. It might be less common.\n\n""RICIN"" has N? And N is out.\n\nAnother common word: ""CRISP"" is invalid.\n\n""CRIMP"" -> C at 1, R at 2: invalid.\n\n""ROUCH"" is not common.\n\n""COURT"" -> C at 1, which we know is wrong? But we can avoid C at 1. In ""COURT"", C is at 1, so we shouldn\'t use that.\n\n""TRUCE"" has E.\n\n""BRICK"" -> B, R, I, C, K. \n- R at position 2? But we know that position 2 is not R (from the first guess). So we cannot put R at position 2. \n- In ""BRICK"", R is at position 2, which we know is wrong. So we avoid.\n\nBut if we put R at position 1? Then we have ""BRICK"" but with R at 1? That would be ""R"" at 1 and then ... but ""BRICK"" has R at 2.\n\nHow about ""R"" at 1 and ""C"" at 4? Like ""RELIC"" but has E.\n\n""RHINO"" has N and O? But N is out.\n\n""ROBOT"" -> R at 1, but no C? We must include C.\n\nSo we need both.\n\nI think ""ROCKY"" and ""SCRUB"" are good candidates.\n\nLet me compare:\n- ""ROCKY"": R at 1, O at 2, C at 3, K at 4, Y at 5.\n  - We are testing R at position 1 (which is new) and C at position 3 (new). Also, O, K, Y are new.\n- ""SCRUB"": S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5.\n  - We are testing C at position 2 (which we haven\'t tried for C) and R at position 3 (new). Also, S, U, B are new.\n\nWe might get more information from ""SCRUB"" because it has S and U, which are common.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was wrong. Now, if we put C at position 2, that might be correct? We don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has C and R and also uses a vowel we haven\'t tried, like I or O or U.\n\nAnother candidate: ""OUNCE"" has E? Out.\n\n""CLOUR"" -> C at 1: invalid.\n\n""MICRO"" -> M, I, C, R, O. \n- C at position 3, R at position 4. \n- Avoids A, N, E. \n- Positions: M(1), I(2), C(3), R(4), O(5). \n- We haven\'t tried M, I, O. \n- And we are putting C at 3 and R at 4, which are new positions.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nBut is ""MICRO"" a valid word? Yes, as in microcomputer, etc.\n\nSo now we have:\n- ""ROCKY"": R at 1, O at 2, C at 3, K at 4, Y at 5\n- ""SCRUB"": S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, U at 4, B at 5\n- ""MICRO"": M at 1, I at 2, C at 3, R at 4, O at 5\n\nWe want to choose one that maximizes the chance of getting more feedback.\n\nNote: We know the secret word has C and R, and we are trying to find their positions and other letters.\n\nI think ""MICRO"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and places C and R in new positions (3 and 4). Also, it tests M, I, O.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that uses more high-frequency letters.\n\nAnother word: ""CHOIR"" -> C at 1: invalid.\n\n""CRITH"" is not common.\n\nI think ""MICRO"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut wait, in ""MICRO"", we are putting I at position 2. We don\'t know if I is in the word, but it\'s a common vowel.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""PORCH"" which has P, O, R, C, H. R at 3, C at 4.\n\nBut ""PORCH"" uses O and H, which are common.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""MICRO"" because it tests M and I, which we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut note: we are trying to avoid repeating positions. We know C is not at 1, so we put it at 3. R is not at 2, so we put it at 4.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""MICRO"".\n\nBut wait, what about the feedback?

R ? C"" -> e.g., ""I R ? C"" at the end.\n\nWord: ""DIRTY"" but has D, I, R, T, Y -> but no C? We must have C.\n\nWe need C in the word.\n\nAnother possibility: ""C"" at 2, ""R"" at 3, ""I"" at 4? But we have to avoid R at position 2? No, R at position 3 is allowed.\n\nBut we also have to avoid C at position 1, which we are by putting C at 2.\n\nFor example, ""SCRIB"": S, C, R, I, B -> \n- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3), I(4), B(5). \n- This uses S, C, R, I, B. \n- Avoids A, N, E, M, O. \n- Now, check the constraints:\n  - C is at position 2: we don\'t have any constraint against C at 2? Only that it cannot be at 1 or 3. So position 2 is allowed.\n  - R is at position 3: we know R cannot be at 2 or 4, but 3 is allowed.\n  - I is at position 4: we know I cannot be at 2, but 4 is allowed.\n\nSo ""SCRIB"" is a valid candidate? But is ""SCRIB"" a word? It might be an abbreviation, but in Wordle, we need valid words. ""SCRIB"" is not a common word. The word ""SCRIBE"" has E, which is out.\n\nAnother word: ""PRICY"": P, R, I, C, Y -> \n- Positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), Y(5). \n- But R is at position 2 -> invalid (we know R cannot be at position 2).\n\n""CRITH"" is not common.\n\n""BIRCH"": B, I, R, C, H -> \n- Positions: B(1), I(2), R(3), C(4), H(5). \n- But I is at position 2: we know I cannot be at position 2 (from the feedback of ""micro"", I was at position 2 and marked wrong position). So I cannot be at position 2. Therefore, ""BIRCH"" is invalid because I is at position 2.\n\nWe must avoid putting I at position 2.\n\nIn ""SCRIB"", I is at position 4, which is okay.\n\nBut ""SCRIB"" might not be valid. Let me think of alternatives.\n\nAnother word: ""FRITZ"" has Z, but no C? We need C.\n\n""CRICK"": C at 1 -> invalid.\n\n""R"" at 1, ""C"" at 5, and ""I"" at 3: for example, ""R I ? ?

R""\n\nWord: ""ICKER"" not a word.\n\nHow about ""PICKY"": but no R.\n\nWe need R.\n\nAnother idea: ""C"" at 4, ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 3: ""R ? I C ?"" -> e.g., ""R U I C K"" -> ""RUICK"" not a word.\n\n""QUICK"" has Q, U, I, C, K -> but Q and U are allowed? We haven\'t ruled out Q and U. But ""QUICK"" doesn\'t have R? We must have R.\n\nSo not.\n\n""CRIMP"" has C at 1 and R at 2: invalid.\n\n""SCRIP"": S, C, R, I, P -> \n- Positions: S(1), C(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). \n- This is similar to ""SCRIB"" but with P instead of B. \n- ""SCRIP"" is a valid word (meaning a small piece or a writing). \n- Check constraints:\n  - C at 2: allowed (not 1 or 3)\n  - R at 3: allowed (not 2 or 4)\n  - I at 4: allowed (not 2)\n\nAnd avoids A, N, E, M, O.\n\nSo ""SCRIP"" is a good candidate.\n\nAnother candidate: ""STRIP"" -> S, T, R, I, P -> but no C? We must have C.\n\n""SCRIM"" has M? M is ruled out.\n\n""CRISP"" is invalid.\n\n""PRICK"": P, R, I, C, K -> \n- Positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), C(4), K(5). \n- But R at position 2 is invalid.\n\nSo not.\n\n""BRISK"": B, R, I, S, K -> \n- Positions: B(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), K(5). \n- But R at position 2 is invalid.\n\nUnless we can move R to a different position? But in ""BRISK"", R is fixed at 2.\n\nHow about ""FICUS"" has U, S, but no R.\n\nI think ""SCRIP"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word with R at position 1.\n\nFor example, ""R"" at 1, ""I"" at 3, ""C"" at 5: ""R ? I ? C"" -> e.g., ""R D I C K"" -> ""R DICK"" not a word. Or ""R U I C K"" not a word.\n\n""R"" at 1, ""C"" at 3, ""I"" at 4: ""R ? C I ?"" -> e.g., ""R O C I S"" but O is out. ""R U C I D"" has D, but U, C, I, D -> ""RUCID"" not a word.\n\n""R"" at 5, ""C"" at 2, ""I"" at 1: ""I ? C ? R"" -> e.g., ""I S C U R"" -> ""ISCUR"" not a word.\n\n""R"" at 3, ""C"" at 5, ""I"" at 1: ""I ? R ? C"" -> e.g., ""I T R U C"" -> ""ITRUC"" not a word. Or ""I B R I C"" has two I\'s? Not allowed? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters, but we haven\'t seen any duplicate yet, so we can assume no duplicates? Actually, we don\'t know, but to be safe, we can avoid duplicates for now.\n\nBut in ""SCRIP"", all letters are distinct.\n\nAnother word: ""CURIO"" has O and U, but O is out.\n\n""GUILD"" no C or R.\n\nI think ""SCRIP"" is a valid and good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm the word: ""scrip"" is accepted in Wordle as a valid guess.\n\nSo we\'ll go with ""SCRIP"".\n\nTherefore, our third guess is ""SCRIP"".\n\nBut note: we are putting C at position 2 and R at position 3. We know that in the secret word, C is not at 1 or 3, so position 2 is possible. R is not at 2 or 4, so position 3 is possible. I is at position 4, which is allowed.\n\nWe are also testing S and P.\n\nSo, we guess ""SCRIP"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)  \n  - C and R are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2, respectively.  \n  - A, N, E are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: MICRO** → M(x) I(-) C(-) R(-) O(x)  \n  - I is in the word but not in position 2.  \n  - C is in the word but not in position 3.  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 4.  \n  - M and O are absent.  \n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- **Confirmed letters in the word**: C, R, I (must be included).  \n- **Absent letters**: A, E, M, N, O (cannot be used).  \n- **Position constraints**:  \n  - C: Cannot be in position 1 or 3 (possible: 2, 4, 5).  \n  - R: Cannot be in position 2 or 4 (possible: 1, 3, 5).  \n  - I: Cannot be in position 2 (possible: 1, 3, 4, 5).  \n- **Goal for next guess**:  \n  - Include C, R, I in valid positions.  \n  - Avoid absent letters (A, E, M, N, O).  \n  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, P, B, T, U) to maximize information.  \n\n### Analysis for Guess 3:\nAfter evaluating possible words that fit the constraints (e.g., ""SCRIP"", ""BRICK"", ""TRICK""), ""SCRIP"" was selected because:  \n- It places C at position 2 (allowed, as C cannot be in 1 or 3).  \n- It places R at position 3 (allowed, as R cannot be in 2 or 4).  \n- It places I at position 4 (allowed, as I cannot be in 2).  \n- It uses new letters S and P (common consonants not yet tested).  \n- It avoids all absent letters (A, E, M, N, O).  \n\nThis guess will help verify the positions of C, R, I while testing S and P for presence/position.\n\n<guess>scrip</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: micro -> FEEDBACK: M(x) I(-) C(-) R(-) O(x)\nGuess 3: scrip -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) R(✓) I(✓) P(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""scrip"":
- S: (x) meaning S is not in the secret word.
- C: (-) meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position (here at position 2).
- R: (✓) meaning R is in the correct position (position 3).
- I: (✓) meaning I is in the correct position (position 4).
- P: (x) meaning P is not in the secret word.

So, from this feedback:
- R is at position 3 (correct).
- I is at position 4 (correct).
- C is in the word but not at position 2 (wrong position).
- S and P are not in the word.

Previously we know:
- From guess 1: C cannot be at position 1.
- From guess 2: C cannot be at position 3.
- Now from guess 3: C cannot be at position 2.
Therefore, C must be at position 5 (since positions 1,2,3 are all ruled out, and we have 5 letters). 
Possible positions for C are 4 and 5, but position 4 is already occupied by I (which is correct), so C cannot be at position 4. Thus, C must be at position 5.

Also, we know:
- The word so far: _ _ R I _ 
With C at position 5: so _ _ R I C

We also know from previous feedback that the word contains C, R, I (and we have them placed).

But we have a fifth letter at position 1 and 2.

We know the secret word does not contain: A, N, E, M, O, S, P (from previous feedback).

We need to find a valid 5-letter word of the form: _ _ R I C

The missing letters are at positions 1 and 2.

We have to avoid A, N, E, M, O, S, P.

What letters are still possible? B, D, F, G, H, K, L, T, U, W, Y, etc.

Now, the word must be a valid English word ending with ""RIC"", specifically ""_ _ R I C"".

Common words: 
- ""ULRIC""? But ""U"" might be allowed? But we need two letters. Actually, it's 5 letters: position 1,2, then R,I,C.

Words like: 
- ""CURIC"" - not a word.
- ""BARIC""? But A is ruled out.

Let me think of words ending with ""RIC"".

Examples:
- ""CEDRIC"" - too long? We need 5 letters.
- ""DERRIC"" - not a word? ""Derrick"" is longer.

5-letter words ending with ""RIC"":
- ""LYRIC"": L, Y, R, I, C -> positions 1:L, 2:Y, 3:R, 4:I, 5:C -> perfect.
  - Check letters: L and Y. We haven't ruled out L or Y. Also, avoids A,N,E,M,O,S,P.
- ""PYRIC"": P is ruled out? P is absent in feedback from guess 3.
- ""TARIC"": T-A-R-I-C, but A is ruled out? A is absent.
- ""BARIC"": A ruled out.
- ""HERIC""? Not a common word.
- ""METRIC"": has M and E? No.
- ""ENTRIC"": has E and N? No.

Other possibilities:
- ""GYRIC""? Not common.
- ""CHRIC""? Not a word.
- ""LYRIC"" seems a valid candidate.

Another common one: ""CIVIC"" - but no R? And positions: C at 1? But we know C cannot be at position 1 (from first guess). Also ""CIVIC"" has V, but doesn't have R? We need R at 3.

""LYRIC"" has L at 1, Y at 2, R at 3, I at 4, C at 5. This fits the pattern.

Is there ""MYRIC""? Not common.

""RYRIC"" not a word.

""We must try to think of all possibilities.

""LA RIC""? Not a word.

""LYRIC"" is a valid English word meaning expressing feelings like a song.

Therefore, a strong candidate is ""LYRIC"".

But are there other words?

""TYRIC"" not a word.

""BYRIC"" not a word.

""DRY RIC"" no.

""FLICK"" has nothing.

Perhaps ""U R I C"" with a letter? But it must be 5 letters.

Another word: ""W R I C"" with an extra letter? Only ""lyric"" seems to fit.

""HYRIC""? Not a word.

""CUBIC"" has no R and C at 1.

I think ""LYRIC"" is the most plausible.

But let me double-check the constraints:

- C is at position 5: allowed? Yes, and we deduced it must be there.
- R at 3: correct.
- I at 4: correct.

Now, L and Y: 
- L has not been tested before, so we don't know if it's in or out? But the word might contain L and Y.

We have to make sure that L and Y are not in the list of absent letters. We haven't guessed L or Y, so they are possible.

Also, the word must be valid.

Therefore, our fourth guess can be ""LYRIC"".

But note: we have a ✓ for R and I already, meaning we know the word ends with ""RIC"" and has I at 4. So ""_ _ R I C"" with the first two letters being unknown.

Are there any other common words?
- ""CHRIC"" not a word.
- ""PURIC"" has P? P is ruled out.
- ""FURIC"" has U, F? But is it a word? ""furic"" relating to furoic acid? Not common.
- ""TURIC"" not a word.

So ""LYRIC"" appears to be the best candidate.

We could guess other words to test L and Y, but since we only have 2 unknowns, and we have to satisfy the known constraints, ""LYRIC"" fits.

Moreover, if we guess ""LYRIC"", and if correct, we win. Otherwise, the feedback will help.

But there might be a possibility of multiple words? For example, ""DERIC"" has E? E is ruled out.

""HAIRC"" not 5 letters.

""LYRIC"" seems the only common word.

So we guess ""LYRIC"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Step 1: Analyze Feedback History
- **Guess 1: CRANE → C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  - C and R are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.  
  - A, N, E are absent.  
- **Guess 2: MICRO → M(x) I(-) C(-) R(-) O(x)**  
  - I is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - M and O are absent.  
- **Guess 3: SCRIP → S(x) C(-) R(✓) I(✓) P(x)**  
  - R is correct at position 3 (✓).  
  - I is correct at position 4 (✓).  
  - C is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
  - S and P are absent (x).  

### Step 2: Deduce Known Information
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: C, R, I.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - R is fixed at position 3 (✓ from Guess 3).  
  - I is fixed at position 4 (✓ from Guess 3).  
  - C must be in the word but cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1), position 3 (from Guess 2, and position 3 is now R), or position 2 (from Guess 3). The only remaining position is 5.  
    - Thus, **C must be at position 5**.  
- **Absent letters**: A, E, M, N, O, S, P (from all feedback).  
- **Word structure**: The secret word has:  
  - Position 3: R  
  - Position 4: I  
  - Position 5: C  
  - Position 1 and 2: Unknown letters not in the absent list (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, T, U, W, Y, etc.).  
- **Pattern**: The word must match the pattern `_ _ R I C`.  

### Step 3: Generate Possible Words
Given the pattern `_ _ R I C` and avoiding absent letters, valid English words include:  
- **LYRIC**: Positions: L(1), Y(2), R(3), I(4), C(5). Letters L and Y are untested and not in the absent list.  
- Other potential words (e.g., ""DERIC"", ""TARIC"") were rejected because D and E are absent/positionally invalid, or the words are uncommon. ""LYRIC"" is the most common valid word fitting all constraints.  

### Step 4: Select the Guess
- **Why LYRIC?**:  
  - Confirms if L and Y are in the word and their positions.  
  - Matches the deduced pattern `_ _ R I C`.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on L/Y will narrow options further (e.g., position clues for position 1/2).  
- Given the accumulated feedback, ""LYRIC"" is the strongest candidate to solve the puzzle efficiently.  

<guess>lyric</guess>",lyric,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""scrip"":
- S: (x) meaning S is not in the secret word.
- C: (-) meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position (here at position 2).
- R: (✓) meaning R is in the correct position (position 3).
- I: (✓) meaning I is in the correct position (position 4).
- P: (x) meaning P is not in the secret word.

So, from this feedback:
- R is at position 3 (correct).
- I is at position 4 (correct).
- C is in the word but not at position 2 (wrong position).
- S and P are not in the word.

Previously we know:
- From guess 1: C cannot be at position 1.
- From guess 2: C cannot be at position 3.
- Now from guess 3: C cannot be at position 2.
Therefore, C must be at position 5 (since positions 1,2,3 are all ruled out, and we have 5 letters). 
Possible positions for C are 4 and 5, but position 4 is already occupied by I (which is correct), so C cannot be at position 4. Thus, C must be at position 5.

Also, we know:
- The word so far: _ _ R I _ 
With C at position 5: so _ _ R I C

We also know from previous feedback that the word contains C, R, I (and we have them placed).

But we have a fifth letter at position 1 and 2.

We know the secret word does not contain: A, N, E, M, O, S, P (from previous feedback).

We need to find a valid 5-letter word of the form: _ _ R I C

The missing letters are at positions 1 and 2.

We have to avoid A, N, E, M, O, S, P.

What letters are still possible? B, D, F, G, H, K, L, T, U, W, Y, etc.

Now, the word must be a valid English word ending with ""RIC"", specifically ""_ _ R I C"".

Common words: 
- ""ULRIC""? But ""U"" might be allowed? But we need two letters. Actually, it's 5 letters: position 1,2, then R,I,C.

Words like: 
- ""CURIC"" - not a word.
- ""BARIC""? But A is ruled out.

Let me think of words ending with ""RIC"".

Examples:
- ""CEDRIC"" - too long? We need 5 letters.
- ""DERRIC"" - not a word? ""Derrick"" is longer.

5-letter words ending with ""RIC"":
- ""LYRIC"": L, Y, R, I, C -> positions 1:L, 2:Y, 3:R, 4:I, 5:C -> perfect.
  - Check letters: L and Y. We haven't ruled out L or Y. Also, avoids A,N,E,M,O,S,P.
- ""PYRIC"": P is ruled out? P is absent in feedback from guess 3.
- ""TARIC"": T-A-R-I-C, but A is ruled out? A is absent.
- ""BARIC"": A ruled out.
- ""HERIC""? Not a common word.
- ""METRIC"": has M and E? No.
- ""ENTRIC"": has E and N? No.

Other possibilities:
- ""GYRIC""? Not common.
- ""CHRIC""? Not a word.
- ""LYRIC"" seems a valid candidate.

Another common one: ""CIVIC"" - but no R? And positions: C at 1? But we know C cannot be at position 1 (from first guess). Also ""CIVIC"" has V, but doesn't have R? We need R at 3.

""LYRIC"" has L at 1, Y at 2, R at 3, I at 4, C at 5. This fits the pattern.

Is there ""MYRIC""? Not common.

""RYRIC"" not a word.

""We must try to think of all possibilities.

""LA RIC""? Not a word.

""LYRIC"" is a valid English word meaning expressing feelings like a song.

Therefore, a strong candidate is ""LYRIC"".

But are there other words?

""TYRIC"" not a word.

""BYRIC"" not a word.

""DRY RIC"" no.

""FLICK"" has nothing.

Perhaps ""U R I C"" with a letter? But it must be 5 letters.

Another word: ""W R I C"" with an extra letter? Only ""lyric"" seems to fit.

""HYRIC""? Not a word.

""CUBIC"" has no R and C at 1.

I think ""LYRIC"" is the most plausible.

But let me double-check the constraints:

- C is at position 5: allowed? Yes, and we deduced it must be there.
- R at 3: correct.
- I at 4: correct.

Now, L and Y: 
- L has not been tested before, so we don't know if it's in or out? But the word might contain L and Y.

We have to make sure that L and Y are not in the list of absent letters. We haven't guessed L or Y, so they are possible.

Also, the word must be valid.

Therefore, our fourth guess can be ""LYRIC"".

But note: we have a ✓ for R and I already, meaning we know the word ends with ""RIC"" and has I at 4. So ""_ _ R I C"" with the first two letters being unknown.

Are there any other common words?
- ""CHRIC"" not a word.
- ""PURIC"" has P? P is ruled out.
- ""FURIC"" has U, F? But is it a word? ""furic"" relating to furoic acid? Not common.
- ""TURIC"" not a word.

So ""LYRIC"" appears to be the best candidate.

We could guess other words to test L and Y, but since we only have 2 unknowns, and we have to satisfy the known constraints, ""LYRIC"" fits.

Moreover, if we guess ""LYRIC"", and if correct, we win. Otherwise, the feedback will help.

But there might be a possibility of multiple words? For example, ""DERIC"" has E? E is ruled out.

""HAIRC"" not 5 letters.

""LYRIC"" seems the only common word.

So we guess ""LYRIC"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses, here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Step 1: Analyze Feedback History
- **Guess 1: CRANE → C(-) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  - C and R are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2.  
  - A, N, E are absent.  
- **Guess 2: MICRO → M(x) I(-) C(-) R(-) O(x)**  
  - I is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - M and O are absent.  
- **Guess 3: SCRIP → S(x) C(-) R(✓) I(✓) P(x)**  
  - R is correct at position 3 (✓).  
  - I is correct at position 4 (✓).  
  - C is in the word but not in position 2 (-).  
  - S and P are absent (x).  

### Step 2: Deduce Known Information
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: C, R, I.  
- **Position constraints**:  
  - R is fixed at position 3 (✓ from Guess 3).  
  - I is fixed at position 4 (✓ from Guess 3).  
  - C must be in the word but cannot be in position 1 (from Guess 1), position 3 (from Guess 2, and position 3 is now R), or position 2 (from Guess 3). The only remaining position is 5.  
    - Thus, **C must be at position 5**.  
- **Absent letters**: A, E, M, N, O, S, P (from all feedback).  
- **Word structure**: The secret word has:  
  - Position 3: R  
  - Position 4: I  
  - Position 5: C  
  - Position 1 and 2: Unknown letters not in the absent list (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, K, L, T, U, W, Y, etc.).  
- **Pattern**: The word must match the pattern `_ _ R I C`.  

### Step 3: Generate Possible Words
Given the pattern `_ _ R I C` and avoiding absent letters, valid English words include:  
- **LYRIC**: Positions: L(1), Y(2), R(3), I(4), C(5). Letters L and Y are untested and not in the absent list.  
- Other potential words (e.g., ""DERIC"", ""TARIC"") were rejected because D and E are absent/positionally invalid, or the words are uncommon. ""LYRIC"" is the most common valid word fitting all constraints.  

### Step 4: Select the Guess
- **Why LYRIC?**:  
  - Confirms if L and Y are in the word and their positions.  
  - Matches the deduced pattern `_ _ R I C`.  
  - If incorrect, feedback on L/Y will narrow options further (e.g., position clues for position 1/2).  
- Given the accumulated feedback, ""LYRIC"" is the strongest candidate to solve the puzzle efficiently.",Guess 4: lyric -> FEEDBACK: L(✓) Y(✓) R(✓) I(✓) C(✓),SUCCESS
