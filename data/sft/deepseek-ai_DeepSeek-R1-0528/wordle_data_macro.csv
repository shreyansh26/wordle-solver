We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - C is in the secret word but not in the first position.
   - R is in the secret word but not in the second position.
   - A is in the secret word but not in the third position.
   - N is not in the secret word.
   - E is not in the secret word.

 So, the secret word contains the letters C, R, and A, but not in the positions we guessed. Also, it does not contain N or E.

 Since we know the secret word has C, R, and A, and we have three positions where they are misplaced, we can try a new word that:
   - Does not use N or E (since they are absent).
   - Places C, R, and A in different positions than the first guess (positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively).

 Additionally, we should avoid using the same letters again unless we are testing other positions.

 We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Let's think of a word that includes C, R, A and two new letters (since we have three known letters and two more to find).

 We have to avoid positions:
   - C cannot be in position 1.
   - R cannot be in position 2.
   - A cannot be in position 3.

 We can try to put C in position 2, 3, 4, or 5; R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5; A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 But note: we also have two more letters to guess.

 Since we have three known letters (C, R, A) and two unknown, we might try a word that rearranges these and adds two new common consonants.

 However, we must also consider that the feedback told us that in the first guess, the first three letters were all present but misplaced. So the word must have C, R, A in positions other than 1,2,3? Not exactly: it could have one of them in the first three but in a different position? Actually, the feedback says:
   Position 1: C is present but not here -> so C is in the word but not at position 1.
   Position 2: R is present but not here -> so R is in the word but not at position 2.
   Position 3: A is present but not here -> so A is in the word but not at position 3.

 So the word has C, R, A, and they are in positions that are not 1, 2, 3 respectively.

 But note: they could be in any of the other positions. For example, C could be in position 2? Actually, no: because if C were in position 2, then in the first guess we had C at position 1 and the secret word has C at position 2, then the feedback for position 1 would be (-) meaning it's in the word but not here, and for position 2 we had R which is not C so that would be separate. But the feedback for position 2 was R(-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. So the secret word has R somewhere else.

 We have to form a word that has C, R, A and two other letters (excluding N and E).

 Let's try to think of words that have C, R, A and two other consonants (since vowels are limited: we already have A and we know E is out, so we might use I, O, U, but we don't know if they are present).

 We can try to use a word that puts C, R, A in positions that are not 1,2,3? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we have five positions.

 We might try to put C in position 4 or 5, R in position 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2), and A in position 1,2,4,5 (but not 3). However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 Let's try to use R in the first position? That would be allowed because the feedback only said R is not in position 2, but it could be in position 1.

 Similarly, A could be in position 1? But then we have R and A both wanting position 1? We can't. So we have to assign each letter to a different position.

 We have three letters: C, R, A. We need to assign them to three different positions from the set {1,2,3,4,5} with the constraints:
   - C cannot be at 1.
   - R cannot be at 2.
   - A cannot be at 3.

 We also have two more letters to fill.

 Let me try to think of words that start with R? Because R is a common starting letter.

 Example: ""R"" at position 1. Then we have to place C and A in positions 2,3,4,5 but with constraints:
   - C cannot be at 1 (already taken by R) -> okay, but also C must be in the word and not at 1 (which we already satisfied).
   - A cannot be at 3.

 So if we put R at 1, then we can put A at 2? But the constraint for A is only that it cannot be at 3. So A can be at 2. Then we can put C at 4 or 5.

 Then we have two more letters to fill at positions 3 and 5 (if we put C at 4) or 3 and 4 (if we put C at 5). But note: we cannot use N or E.

 Also, we must avoid putting A at 3? Actually, we are putting A at 2, so that's okay.

 So a candidate: R at 1, A at 2, then we need a letter at 3, then C at 4, and a letter at 5.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess had A at position 3 and said it was present but not at 3. So if we put A at 2, that's a new position. That should be acceptable.

 However, we must check if such a word exists. Let's try ""R A _ C ?"". We need a word: R A ? C ?.

 We have to avoid E and N. Let's try common letters. For the third position, we can try a vowel? Since we have A already, maybe I, O, U? Or a consonant.

 Example: ""R A I L C"" -> no, that's 5 letters? Actually, we need 5 letters: positions 1: R, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: C, 5: ?.

 How about ""R A I C S""? That's not a word. ""R A C K S"" -> but that has C at position 3? We are putting C at 4. So we need a word with the pattern R A ? C ?.

 Let me think: ""REACH"" -> but we cannot use E. ""RATCH"" -> that's a word? R A T C H -> but that's 5 letters? Actually, R A T C H is 5 letters? R-A-T-C-H? But H is the fifth.

 But we have to avoid E, and T is allowed. Also, we haven't used T before. So ""RATCH"" is a word? I think ""ratch"" is a word (a ratchet). But let me confirm: yes, it's a valid word.

 However, note: we have the constraint that in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C and we now know that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""RATCH"", C is at position 4. That's okay.

 But what about the feedback for the first guess? We had:
   C at 1: present but not here -> in the secret word, C is at 4 -> so when we guess ""crane"", the C at 1 would get (-) because the C is at 4? That's correct.

 Now, what about R? In the first guess, R was at position 2. In the secret word ""RATCH"", R is at position 1. So when we guessed ""crane"", the R at position 2: the secret word has R at position 1. So the feedback for position 2 would be (-) because R is in the word but not at position 2? That's correct.

 And A: in the first guess, A was at position 3. In ""RATCH"", A is at position 2. So the feedback for position 3 (A) would be (-) because A is in the word but not at position 3? Correct.

 And N and E are absent: so the feedback for N and E was (x) which matches.

 So ""RATCH"" seems to fit the feedback? But wait, we haven't guessed it yet. We are considering it for the next guess.

 However, we must be cautious: the secret word might not be ""RATCH"". We are just trying to find a word that fits the constraints.

 But note: we are not required to get it right in the second guess, just to get more information.

 However, we have three known letters (C, R, A) and we are using them in ""RATCH"". But we are also introducing T and H. We don't know if T and H are in the word.

 Alternatively, we might try a word that uses more common letters to test other possibilities.

 But let's see: we have three letters that must be included. We are including them. And we are testing two new letters: T and H.

 Another idea: we could try a word that uses the known letters in different positions and also tests other common letters.

 Since we know the word has C, R, A, we can try to put them in positions that we haven't tested. For example, we haven't tested position 5 for any of them.

 We might try a word that ends with C? Or with R?

 Another common approach is to use a word that doesn't repeat the positions we already know are wrong for each letter.

 Let me try to list possible positions for each:

   C: can be in 2,3,4,5
   R: can be in 1,3,4,5
   A: can be in 1,2,4,5

 We can try to assign:
   Let's put R at position 1 (as we did in RATCH) and then A at position 4 and C at position 5? Then we have positions 2 and 3 to fill.

 Example: R _ _ A C

 Words: ""ROTAC"" -> not a word. ""RUSAC"" -> not a word. ""REBAC"" -> not a word and has E.

 Alternatively, put A at position 1? Then we have:
   A at 1: allowed because the constraint is only that A cannot be at 3.
   Then R: cannot be at 2, so we can put R at 3,4,5.
   C: cannot be at 1, so 2,3,4,5.

 Example: A _ R _ C -> ""AURIC"" (meaning relating to the ear) -> but that has U and I, and we don't know about them. Also, it uses I and U which are vowels. But we don't have any feedback about them.

 But note: we are avoiding E and N, but U and I are allowed until we know they are absent.

 However, in ""AURIC"", we have A at 1 (which is allowed), U at 2 (unknown), R at 3 (but wait: the constraint for R is that it cannot be at 2? It can be at 3. So that's okay), I at 4 (unknown), and C at 5 (allowed). 

 But we must check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and the feedback said A is present but not at 3. Now we are putting A at 1. That's a different position, so that's okay.

 However, we are using two new vowels (U and I). We don't know if they are in the word. We might get more information.

 But we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses common consonants that we haven't tried, like T, L, S, etc.

 Since we have three known letters, we might try to use a word that has these three and two of the common consonants that we haven't eliminated (like T, L, S, H, etc.) and that we haven't used (we used C, R, A, and we know N and E are out).

 Let me try to think of words that have C, R, A and two of T, L, S.

 Example: ""CART S"" -> but that's 5 letters? ""CARTS"" -> but we have C at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1 because the feedback said C is not at position 1. So we cannot start with C.

 Similarly, we cannot start with C. So we have to avoid C at position 1.

 How about ""TRACE""? But we cannot use E. ""TRACK"" -> that has T, R, A, C, K.

 Let's check the positions in ""TRACK"":
   T at 1 -> new letter.
   R at 2 -> but the feedback said R cannot be at position 2! Because in the first guess we had R at 2 and it was present but not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2.

 Therefore, ""TRACK"" is invalid because it puts R at 2.

 How about ""CRATE""? But we cannot use E.

 How about ""CRAWL""? 
   C at 1 -> not allowed (because we know C is not at position 1). So no.

 How about ""SCRAP""? 
   S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, A at 4, P at 5.
   Check constraints:
      C: at position 2 -> allowed (since C cannot be at 1, but 2 is okay).
      R: at position 3 -> allowed (since R cannot be at 2, but 3 is okay).
      A: at position 4 -> allowed (since A cannot be at 3, but 4 is okay).
   And we are introducing S and P.

 So ""SCRAP"" is a valid word and satisfies the constraints.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and now we are putting C at position 2. Is that okay? Yes, because the feedback only said C is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at 2.

 Similarly, R was at position 2 in the first guess and now we put it at 3 -> that's okay because the feedback said R is not at 2, but it could be at 3.

 And A was at position 3 in the first guess and now we put it at 4 -> okay.

 So ""SCRAP"" seems like a good candidate.

 Let me check: if the secret word were ""SCRAP"", then the first guess ""crane"" would have:
   C at 1: the secret word has C at 2 -> so (-) for C (correct).
   R at 2: the secret word has R at 3 -> so (-) for R (correct).
   A at 3: the secret word has A at 4 -> so (-) for A (correct).
   N at 4: the secret word has S,C,R,A,P -> no N -> (x) (correct).
   E at 5: not in the word -> (x) (correct).

 So ""SCRAP"" is consistent with the feedback.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word is ""SCRAP"". We are just making a guess to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RATCH"" as we thought earlier. But let's compare:

   ""RATCH"": uses T and H, which are common, but we don't know if they are in the word.
   ""SCRAP"": uses S and P, which are also common.

 Both are valid. But we have to choose one.

 Since we are in the second guess, we want to maximize information. We know the word has C, R, A. We are including them. We are also testing two new letters.

 In ""SCRAP"", we are testing S and P. In ""RATCH"", we are testing T and H.

 We might choose a word that uses letters that are more common in 5-letter words.

 According to letter frequency, T is very common, then S, then H, then P.

 But we are testing two letters. We might also consider the positions.

 However, we have no information about the other two letters. So either is acceptable.

 I'll choose ""SCRAP"" because it uses S (which is very common) and P (also common). Also, it places the known letters in positions we haven't tried (we tried C at1, now at2; R at2, now at3; A at3, now at4).

 So let's go with ""SCRAP"".

 But note: we must make sure that the word is valid. ""SCRAP"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, our second guess is ""scrap"".

<guess>scrap</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, and A are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively; N and E are absent), I need a second guess that:
- Includes C, R, and A
- Avoids N and E
- Places C, R, and A in new positions (C not in position 1, R not in position 2, A not in position 3)
- Tests new common letters (e.g., S, T, P, L) to gather more information

The word ""scrap"" fits these criteria:
- S (new letter) in position 1
- C in position 2 (not position 1)
- R in position 3 (not position 2)
- A in position 4 (not position 3)
- P (new letter) in position 5

This tests S and P while repositioning the known letters. If correct, it could solve the puzzle; if not, the feedback will reveal more about the letter placements and presence of S/P.

<guess>scrap</guess>",scrap,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - C is in the secret word but not in the first position.
   - R is in the secret word but not in the second position.
   - A is in the secret word but not in the third position.
   - N is not in the secret word.
   - E is not in the secret word.

 So, the secret word contains the letters C, R, and A, but not in the positions we guessed. Also, it does not contain N or E.

 Since we know the secret word has C, R, and A, and we have three positions where they are misplaced, we can try a new word that:
   - Does not use N or E (since they are absent).
   - Places C, R, and A in different positions than the first guess (positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively).

 Additionally, we should avoid using the same letters again unless we are testing other positions.

 We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Let's think of a word that includes C, R, A and two new letters (since we have three known letters and two more to find).

 We have to avoid positions:
   - C cannot be in position 1.
   - R cannot be in position 2.
   - A cannot be in position 3.

 We can try to put C in position 2, 3, 4, or 5; R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5; A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 But note: we also have two more letters to guess.

 Since we have three known letters (C, R, A) and two unknown, we might try a word that rearranges these and adds two new common consonants.

 However, we must also consider that the feedback told us that in the first guess, the first three letters were all present but misplaced. So the word must have C, R, A in positions other than 1,2,3? Not exactly: it could have one of them in the first three but in a different position? Actually, the feedback says:
   Position 1: C is present but not here -> so C is in the word but not at position 1.
   Position 2: R is present but not here -> so R is in the word but not at position 2.
   Position 3: A is present but not here -> so A is in the word but not at position 3.

 So the word has C, R, A, and they are in positions that are not 1, 2, 3 respectively.

 But note: they could be in any of the other positions. For example, C could be in position 2? Actually, no: because if C were in position 2, then in the first guess we had C at position 1 and the secret word has C at position 2, then the feedback for position 1 would be (-) meaning it's in the word but not here, and for position 2 we had R which is not C so that would be separate. But the feedback for position 2 was R(-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. So the secret word has R somewhere else.

 We have to form a word that has C, R, A and two other letters (excluding N and E).

 Let's try to think of words that have C, R, A and two other consonants (since vowels are limited: we already have A and we know E is out, so we might use I, O, U, but we don't know if they are present).

 We can try to use a word that puts C, R, A in positions that are not 1,2,3? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we have five positions.

 We might try to put C in position 4 or 5, R in position 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2), and A in position 1,2,4,5 (but not 3). However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 Let's try to use R in the first position? That would be allowed because the feedback only said R is not in position 2, but it could be in position 1.

 Similarly, A could be in position 1? But then we have R and A both wanting position 1? We can't. So we have to assign each letter to a different position.

 We have three letters: C, R, A. We need to assign them to three different positions from the set {1,2,3,4,5} with the constraints:
   - C cannot be at 1.
   - R cannot be at 2.
   - A cannot be at 3.

 We also have two more letters to fill.

 Let me try to think of words that start with R? Because R is a common starting letter.

 Example: ""R"" at position 1. Then we have to place C and A in positions 2,3,4,5 but with constraints:
   - C cannot be at 1 (already taken by R) -> okay, but also C must be in the word and not at 1 (which we already satisfied).
   - A cannot be at 3.

 So if we put R at 1, then we can put A at 2? But the constraint for A is only that it cannot be at 3. So A can be at 2. Then we can put C at 4 or 5.

 Then we have two more letters to fill at positions 3 and 5 (if we put C at 4) or 3 and 4 (if we put C at 5). But note: we cannot use N or E.

 Also, we must avoid putting A at 3? Actually, we are putting A at 2, so that's okay.

 So a candidate: R at 1, A at 2, then we need a letter at 3, then C at 4, and a letter at 5.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess had A at position 3 and said it was present but not at 3. So if we put A at 2, that's a new position. That should be acceptable.

 However, we must check if such a word exists. Let's try ""R A _ C ?"". We need a word: R A ? C ?.

 We have to avoid E and N. Let's try common letters. For the third position, we can try a vowel? Since we have A already, maybe I, O, U? Or a consonant.

 Example: ""R A I L C"" -> no, that's 5 letters? Actually, we need 5 letters: positions 1: R, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: C, 5: ?.

 How about ""R A I C S""? That's not a word. ""R A C K S"" -> but that has C at position 3? We are putting C at 4. So we need a word with the pattern R A ? C ?.

 Let me think: ""REACH"" -> but we cannot use E. ""RATCH"" -> that's a word? R A T C H -> but that's 5 letters? Actually, R A T C H is 5 letters? R-A-T-C-H? But H is the fifth.

 But we have to avoid E, and T is allowed. Also, we haven't used T before. So ""RATCH"" is a word? I think ""ratch"" is a word (a ratchet). But let me confirm: yes, it's a valid word.

 However, note: we have the constraint that in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C and we now know that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""RATCH"", C is at position 4. That's okay.

 But what about the feedback for the first guess? We had:
   C at 1: present but not here -> in the secret word, C is at 4 -> so when we guess ""crane"", the C at 1 would get (-) because the C is at 4? That's correct.

 Now, what about R? In the first guess, R was at position 2. In the secret word ""RATCH"", R is at position 1. So when we guessed ""crane"", the R at position 2: the secret word has R at position 1. So the feedback for position 2 would be (-) because R is in the word but not at position 2? That's correct.

 And A: in the first guess, A was at position 3. In ""RATCH"", A is at position 2. So the feedback for position 3 (A) would be (-) because A is in the word but not at position 3? Correct.

 And N and E are absent: so the feedback for N and E was (x) which matches.

 So ""RATCH"" seems to fit the feedback? But wait, we haven't guessed it yet. We are considering it for the next guess.

 However, we must be cautious: the secret word might not be ""RATCH"". We are just trying to find a word that fits the constraints.

 But note: we are not required to get it right in the second guess, just to get more information.

 However, we have three known letters (C, R, A) and we are using them in ""RATCH"". But we are also introducing T and H. We don't know if T and H are in the word.

 Alternatively, we might try a word that uses more common letters to test other possibilities.

 But let's see: we have three letters that must be included. We are including them. And we are testing two new letters: T and H.

 Another idea: we could try a word that uses the known letters in different positions and also tests other common letters.

 Since we know the word has C, R, A, we can try to put them in positions that we haven't tested. For example, we haven't tested position 5 for any of them.

 We might try a word that ends with C? Or with R?

 Another common approach is to use a word that doesn't repeat the positions we already know are wrong for each letter.

 Let me try to list possible positions for each:

   C: can be in 2,3,4,5
   R: can be in 1,3,4,5
   A: can be in 1,2,4,5

 We can try to assign:
   Let's put R at position 1 (as we did in RATCH) and then A at position 4 and C at position 5? Then we have positions 2 and 3 to fill.

 Example: R _ _ A C

 Words: ""ROTAC"" -> not a word. ""RUSAC"" -> not a word. ""REBAC"" -> not a word and has E.

 Alternatively, put A at position 1? Then we have:
   A at 1: allowed because the constraint is only that A cannot be at 3.
   Then R: cannot be at 2, so we can put R at 3,4,5.
   C: cannot be at 1, so 2,3,4,5.

 Example: A _ R _ C -> ""AURIC"" (meaning relating to the ear) -> but that has U and I, and we don't know about them. Also, it uses I and U which are vowels. But we don't have any feedback about them.

 But note: we are avoiding E and N, but U and I are allowed until we know they are absent.

 However, in ""AURIC"", we have A at 1 (which is allowed), U at 2 (unknown), R at 3 (but wait: the constraint for R is that it cannot be at 2? It can be at 3. So that's okay), I at 4 (unknown), and C at 5 (allowed). 

 But we must check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and the feedback said A is present but not at 3. Now we are putting A at 1. That's a different position, so that's okay.

 However, we are using two new vowels (U and I). We don't know if they are in the word. We might get more information.

 But we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses common consonants that we haven't tried, like T, L, S, etc.

 Since we have three known letters, we might try to use a word that has these three and two of the common consonants that we haven't eliminated (like T, L, S, H, etc.) and that we haven't used (we used C, R, A, and we know N and E are out).

 Let me try to think of words that have C, R, A and two of T, L, S.

 Example: ""CART S"" -> but that's 5 letters? ""CARTS"" -> but we have C at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1 because the feedback said C is not at position 1. So we cannot start with C.

 Similarly, we cannot start with C. So we have to avoid C at position 1.

 How about ""TRACE""? But we cannot use E. ""TRACK"" -> that has T, R, A, C, K.

 Let's check the positions in ""TRACK"":
   T at 1 -> new letter.
   R at 2 -> but the feedback said R cannot be at position 2! Because in the first guess we had R at 2 and it was present but not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2.

 Therefore, ""TRACK"" is invalid because it puts R at 2.

 How about ""CRATE""? But we cannot use E.

 How about ""CRAWL""? 
   C at 1 -> not allowed (because we know C is not at position 1). So no.

 How about ""SCRAP""? 
   S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, A at 4, P at 5.
   Check constraints:
      C: at position 2 -> allowed (since C cannot be at 1, but 2 is okay).
      R: at position 3 -> allowed (since R cannot be at 2, but 3 is okay).
      A: at position 4 -> allowed (since A cannot be at 3, but 4 is okay).
   And we are introducing S and P.

 So ""SCRAP"" is a valid word and satisfies the constraints.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and now we are putting C at position 2. Is that okay? Yes, because the feedback only said C is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at 2.

 Similarly, R was at position 2 in the first guess and now we put it at 3 -> that's okay because the feedback said R is not at 2, but it could be at 3.

 And A was at position 3 in the first guess and now we put it at 4 -> okay.

 So ""SCRAP"" seems like a good candidate.

 Let me check: if the secret word were ""SCRAP"", then the first guess ""crane"" would have:
   C at 1: the secret word has C at 2 -> so (-) for C (correct).
   R at 2: the secret word has R at 3 -> so (-) for R (correct).
   A at 3: the secret word has A at 4 -> so (-) for A (correct).
   N at 4: the secret word has S,C,R,A,P -> no N -> (x) (correct).
   E at 5: not in the word -> (x) (correct).

 So ""SCRAP"" is consistent with the feedback.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word is ""SCRAP"". We are just making a guess to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RATCH"" as we thought earlier. But let's compare:

   ""RATCH"": uses T and H, which are common, but we don't know if they are in the word.
   ""SCRAP"": uses S and P, which are also common.

 Both are valid. But we have to choose one.

 Since we are in the second guess, we want to maximize information. We know the word has C, R, A. We are including them. We are also testing two new letters.

 In ""SCRAP"", we are testing S and P. In ""RATCH"", we are testing T and H.

 We might choose a word that uses letters that are more common in 5-letter words.

 According to letter frequency, T is very common, then S, then H, then P.

 But we are testing two letters. We might also consider the positions.

 However, we have no information about the other two letters. So either is acceptable.

 I'll choose ""SCRAP"" because it uses S (which is very common) and P (also common). Also, it places the known letters in positions we haven't tried (we tried C at1, now at2; R at2, now at3; A at3, now at4).

 So let's go with ""SCRAP"".

 But note: we must make sure that the word is valid. ""SCRAP"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, our second guess is ""scrap"".

<guess>scrap</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, and A are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively; N and E are absent), I need a second guess that:
- Includes C, R, and A
- Avoids N and E
- Places C, R, and A in new positions (C not in position 1, R not in position 2, A not in position 3)
- Tests new common letters (e.g., S, T, P, L) to gather more information

The word ""scrap"" fits these criteria:
- S (new letter) in position 1
- C in position 2 (not position 1)
- R in position 3 (not position 2)
- A in position 4 (not position 3)
- P (new letter) in position 5

This tests S and P while repositioning the known letters. If correct, it could solve the puzzle; if not, the feedback will reveal more about the letter placements and presence of S/P.",Guess 2: scrap -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) R(-) A(-) P(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,macro,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - C is in the secret word but not in the first position.
   - R is in the secret word but not in the second position.
   - A is in the secret word but not in the third position.
   - N is not in the secret word.
   - E is not in the secret word.

 So, the secret word contains the letters C, R, and A, but not in the positions we guessed. Also, it does not contain N or E.

 Since we know the secret word has C, R, and A, and we have three positions where they are misplaced, we can try a new word that:
   - Does not use N or E (since they are absent).
   - Places C, R, and A in different positions than the first guess (positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively).

 Additionally, we should avoid using the same letters again unless we are testing other positions.

 We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Let's think of a word that includes C, R, A and two new letters (since we have three known letters and two more to find).

 We have to avoid positions:
   - C cannot be in position 1.
   - R cannot be in position 2.
   - A cannot be in position 3.

 We can try to put C in position 2, 3, 4, or 5; R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5; A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 But note: we also have two more letters to guess.

 Since we have three known letters (C, R, A) and two unknown, we might try a word that rearranges these and adds two new common consonants.

 However, we must also consider that the feedback told us that in the first guess, the first three letters were all present but misplaced. So the word must have C, R, A in positions other than 1,2,3? Not exactly: it could have one of them in the first three but in a different position? Actually, the feedback says:
   Position 1: C is present but not here -> so C is in the word but not at position 1.
   Position 2: R is present but not here -> so R is in the word but not at position 2.
   Position 3: A is present but not here -> so A is in the word but not at position 3.

 So the word has C, R, A, and they are in positions that are not 1, 2, 3 respectively.

 But note: they could be in any of the other positions. For example, C could be in position 2? Actually, no: because if C were in position 2, then in the first guess we had C at position 1 and the secret word has C at position 2, then the feedback for position 1 would be (-) meaning it's in the word but not here, and for position 2 we had R which is not C so that would be separate. But the feedback for position 2 was R(-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. So the secret word has R somewhere else.

 We have to form a word that has C, R, A and two other letters (excluding N and E).

 Let's try to think of words that have C, R, A and two other consonants (since vowels are limited: we already have A and we know E is out, so we might use I, O, U, but we don't know if they are present).

 We can try to use a word that puts C, R, A in positions that are not 1,2,3? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we have five positions.

 We might try to put C in position 4 or 5, R in position 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2), and A in position 1,2,4,5 (but not 3). However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 Let's try to use R in the first position? That would be allowed because the feedback only said R is not in position 2, but it could be in position 1.

 Similarly, A could be in position 1? But then we have R and A both wanting position 1? We can't. So we have to assign each letter to a different position.

 We have three letters: C, R, A. We need to assign them to three different positions from the set {1,2,3,4,5} with the constraints:
   - C cannot be at 1.
   - R cannot be at 2.
   - A cannot be at 3.

 We also have two more letters to fill.

 Let me try to think of words that start with R? Because R is a common starting letter.

 Example: ""R"" at position 1. Then we have to place C and A in positions 2,3,4,5 but with constraints:
   - C cannot be at 1 (already taken by R) -> okay, but also C must be in the word and not at 1 (which we already satisfied).
   - A cannot be at 3.

 So if we put R at 1, then we can put A at 2? But the constraint for A is only that it cannot be at 3. So A can be at 2. Then we can put C at 4 or 5.

 Then we have two more letters to fill at positions 3 and 5 (if we put C at 4) or 3 and 4 (if we put C at 5). But note: we cannot use N or E.

 Also, we must avoid putting A at 3? Actually, we are putting A at 2, so that's okay.

 So a candidate: R at 1, A at 2, then we need a letter at 3, then C at 4, and a letter at 5.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess had A at position 3 and said it was present but not at 3. So if we put A at 2, that's a new position. That should be acceptable.

 However, we must check if such a word exists. Let's try ""R A _ C ?"". We need a word: R A ? C ?.

 We have to avoid E and N. Let's try common letters. For the third position, we can try a vowel? Since we have A already, maybe I, O, U? Or a consonant.

 Example: ""R A I L C"" -> no, that's 5 letters? Actually, we need 5 letters: positions 1: R, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: C, 5: ?.

 How about ""R A I C S""? That's not a word. ""R A C K S"" -> but that has C at position 3? We are putting C at 4. So we need a word with the pattern R A ? C ?.

 Let me think: ""REACH"" -> but we cannot use E. ""RATCH"" -> that's a word? R A T C H -> but that's 5 letters? Actually, R A T C H is 5 letters? R-A-T-C-H? But H is the fifth.

 But we have to avoid E, and T is allowed. Also, we haven't used T before. So ""RATCH"" is a word? I think ""ratch"" is a word (a ratchet). But let me confirm: yes, it's a valid word.

 However, note: we have the constraint that in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C and we now know that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""RATCH"", C is at position 4. That's okay.

 But what about the feedback for the first guess? We had:
   C at 1: present but not here -> in the secret word, C is at 4 -> so when we guess ""crane"", the C at 1 would get (-) because the C is at 4? That's correct.

 Now, what about R? In the first guess, R was at position 2. In the secret word ""RATCH"", R is at position 1. So when we guessed ""crane"", the R at position 2: the secret word has R at position 1. So the feedback for position 2 would be (-) because R is in the word but not at position 2? That's correct.

 And A: in the first guess, A was at position 3. In ""RATCH"", A is at position 2. So the feedback for position 3 (A) would be (-) because A is in the word but not at position 3? Correct.

 And N and E are absent: so the feedback for N and E was (x) which matches.

 So ""RATCH"" seems to fit the feedback? But wait, we haven't guessed it yet. We are considering it for the next guess.

 However, we must be cautious: the secret word might not be ""RATCH"". We are just trying to find a word that fits the constraints.

 But note: we are not required to get it right in the second guess, just to get more information.

 However, we have three known letters (C, R, A) and we are using them in ""RATCH"". But we are also introducing T and H. We don't know if T and H are in the word.

 Alternatively, we might try a word that uses more common letters to test other possibilities.

 But let's see: we have three letters that must be included. We are including them. And we are testing two new letters: T and H.

 Another idea: we could try a word that uses the known letters in different positions and also tests other common letters.

 Since we know the word has C, R, A, we can try to put them in positions that we haven't tested. For example, we haven't tested position 5 for any of them.

 We might try a word that ends with C? Or with R?

 Another common approach is to use a word that doesn't repeat the positions we already know are wrong for each letter.

 Let me try to list possible positions for each:

   C: can be in 2,3,4,5
   R: can be in 1,3,4,5
   A: can be in 1,2,4,5

 We can try to assign:
   Let's put R at position 1 (as we did in RATCH) and then A at position 4 and C at position 5? Then we have positions 2 and 3 to fill.

 Example: R _ _ A C

 Words: ""ROTAC"" -> not a word. ""RUSAC"" -> not a word. ""REBAC"" -> not a word and has E.

 Alternatively, put A at position 1? Then we have:
   A at 1: allowed because the constraint is only that A cannot be at 3.
   Then R: cannot be at 2, so we can put R at 3,4,5.
   C: cannot be at 1, so 2,3,4,5.

 Example: A _ R _ C -> ""AURIC"" (meaning relating to the ear) -> but that has U and I, and we don't know about them. Also, it uses I and U which are vowels. But we don't have any feedback about them.

 But note: we are avoiding E and N, but U and I are allowed until we know they are absent.

 However, in ""AURIC"", we have A at 1 (which is allowed), U at 2 (unknown), R at 3 (but wait: the constraint for R is that it cannot be at 2? It can be at 3. So that's okay), I at 4 (unknown), and C at 5 (allowed). 

 But we must check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and the feedback said A is present but not at 3. Now we are putting A at 1. That's a different position, so that's okay.

 However, we are using two new vowels (U and I). We don't know if they are in the word. We might get more information.

 But we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses common consonants that we haven't tried, like T, L, S, etc.

 Since we have three known letters, we might try to use a word that has these three and two of the common consonants that we haven't eliminated (like T, L, S, H, etc.) and that we haven't used (we used C, R, A, and we know N and E are out).

 Let me try to think of words that have C, R, A and two of T, L, S.

 Example: ""CART S"" -> but that's 5 letters? ""CARTS"" -> but we have C at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1 because the feedback said C is not at position 1. So we cannot start with C.

 Similarly, we cannot start with C. So we have to avoid C at position 1.

 How about ""TRACE""? But we cannot use E. ""TRACK"" -> that has T, R, A, C, K.

 Let's check the positions in ""TRACK"":
   T at 1 -> new letter.
   R at 2 -> but the feedback said R cannot be at position 2! Because in the first guess we had R at 2 and it was present but not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2.

 Therefore, ""TRACK"" is invalid because it puts R at 2.

 How about ""CRATE""? But we cannot use E.

 How about ""CRAWL""? 
   C at 1 -> not allowed (because we know C is not at position 1). So no.

 How about ""SCRAP""? 
   S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, A at 4, P at 5.
   Check constraints:
      C: at position 2 -> allowed (since C cannot be at 1, but 2 is okay).
      R: at position 3 -> allowed (since R cannot be at 2, but 3 is okay).
      A: at position 4 -> allowed (since A cannot be at 3, but 4 is okay).
   And we are introducing S and P.

 So ""SCRAP"" is a valid word and satisfies the constraints.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and now we are putting C at position 2. Is that okay? Yes, because the feedback only said C is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at 2.

 Similarly, R was at position 2 in the first guess and now we put it at 3 -> that's okay because the feedback said R is not at 2, but it could be at 3.

 And A was at position 3 in the first guess and now we put it at 4 -> okay.

 So ""SCRAP"" seems like a good candidate.

 Let me check: if the secret word were ""SCRAP"", then the first guess ""crane"" would have:
   C at 1: the secret word has C at 2 -> so (-) for C (correct).
   R at 2: the secret word has R at 3 -> so (-) for R (correct).
   A at 3: the secret word has A at 4 -> so (-) for A (correct).
   N at 4: the secret word has S,C,R,A,P -> no N -> (x) (correct).
   E at 5: not in the word -> (x) (correct).

 So ""SCRAP"" is consistent with the feedback.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word is ""SCRAP"". We are just making a guess to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RATCH"" as we thought earlier. But let's compare:

   ""RATCH"": uses T and H, which are common, but we don't know if they are in the word.
   ""SCRAP"": uses S and P, which are also common.

 Both are valid. But we have to choose one.

 Since we are in the second guess, we want to maximize information. We know the word has C, R, A. We are including them. We are also testing two new letters.

 In ""SCRAP"", we are testing S and P. In ""RATCH"", we are testing T and H.

 We might choose a word that uses letters that are more common in 5-letter words.

 According to letter frequency, T is very common, then S, then H, then P.

 But we are testing two letters. We might also consider the positions.

 However, we have no information about the other two letters. So either is acceptable.

 I'll choose ""SCRAP"" because it uses S (which is very common) and P (also common). Also, it places the known letters in positions we haven't tried (we tried C at1, now at2; R at2, now at3; A at3, now at4).

 So let's go with ""SCRAP"".

 But note: we must make sure that the word is valid. ""SCRAP"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, our second guess is ""scrap"".

<guess>scrap</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, and A are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively; N and E are absent), I need a second guess that:
- Includes C, R, and A
- Avoids N and E
- Places C, R, and A in new positions (C not in position 1, R not in position 2, A not in position 3)
- Tests new common letters (e.g., S, T, P, L) to gather more information

The word ""scrap"" fits these criteria:
- S (new letter) in position 1
- C in position 2 (not position 1)
- R in position 3 (not position 2)
- A in position 4 (not position 3)
- P (new letter) in position 5

This tests S and P while repositioning the known letters. If correct, it could solve the puzzle; if not, the feedback will reveal more about the letter placements and presence of S/P.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n Let\'s choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.\n\n I\'ll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n This means:\n   - C is in the secret word but not in the first position.\n   - R is in the secret word but not in the second position.\n   - A is in the secret word but not in the third position.\n   - N is not in the secret word.\n   - E is not in the secret word.\n\n So, the secret word contains the letters C, R, and A, but not in the positions we guessed. Also, it does not contain N or E.\n\n Since we know the secret word has C, R, and A, and we have three positions where they are misplaced, we can try a new word that:\n   - Does not use N or E (since they are absent).\n   - Places C, R, and A in different positions than the first guess (positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively).\n\n Additionally, we should avoid using the same letters again unless we are testing other positions.\n\n We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that includes C, R, A and two new letters (since we have three known letters and two more to find).\n\n We have to avoid positions:\n   - C cannot be in position 1.\n   - R cannot be in position 2.\n   - A cannot be in position 3.\n\n We can try to put C in position 2, 3, 4, or 5; R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5; A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n But note: we also have two more letters to guess.\n\n Since we have three known letters (C, R, A) and two unknown, we might try a word that rearranges these and adds two new common consonants.\n\n However, we must also consider that the feedback told us that in the first guess, the first three letters were all present but misplaced. So the word must have C, R, A in positions other than 1,2,3? Not exactly: it could have one of them in the first three but in a different position? Actually, the feedback says:\n   Position 1: C is present but not here -> so C is in the word but not at position 1.\n   Position 2: R is present but not here -> so R is in the word but not at position 2.\n   Position 3: A is present but not here -> so A is in the word but not at position 3.\n\n So the word has C, R, A, and they are in positions that are not 1, 2, 3 respectively.\n\n But note: they could be in any of the other positions. For example, C could be in position 2? Actually, no: because if C were in position 2, then in the first guess we had C at position 1 and the secret word has C at position 2, then the feedback for position 1 would be (-) meaning it\'s in the word but not here, and for position 2 we had R which is not C so that would be separate. But the feedback for position 2 was R(-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. So the secret word has R somewhere else.\n\n We have to form a word that has C, R, A and two other letters (excluding N and E).\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have C, R, A and two other consonants (since vowels are limited: we already have A and we know E is out, so we might use I, O, U, but we don\'t know if they are present).\n\n We can try to use a word that puts C, R, A in positions that are not 1,2,3? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we have five positions.\n\n We might try to put C in position 4 or 5, R in position 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2), and A in position 1,2,4,5 (but not 3). However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.\n\n Let\'s try to use R in the first position? That would be allowed because the feedback only said R is not in position 2, but it could be in position 1.\n\n Similarly, A could be in position 1? But then we have R and A both wanting position 1? We can\'t. So we have to assign each letter to a different position.\n\n We have three letters: C, R, A. We need to assign them to three different positions from the set {1,2,3,4,5} with the constraints:\n   - C cannot be at 1.\n   - R cannot be at 2.\n   - A cannot be at 3.\n\n We also have two more letters to fill.\n\n Let me try to think of words that start with R? Because R is a common starting letter.\n\n Example: ""R"" at position 1. Then we have to place C and A in positions 2,3,4,5 but with constraints:\n   - C cannot be at 1 (already taken by R) -> okay, but also C must be in the word and not at 1 (which we already satisfied).\n   - A cannot be at 3.\n\n So if we put R at 1, then we can put A at 2? But the constraint for A is only that it cannot be at 3. So A can be at 2. Then we can put C at 4 or 5.\n\n Then we have two more letters to fill at positions 3 and 5 (if we put C at 4) or 3 and 4 (if we put C at 5). But note: we cannot use N or E.\n\n Also, we must avoid putting A at 3? Actually, we are putting A at 2, so that\'s okay.\n\n So a candidate: R at 1, A at 2, then we need a letter at 3, then C at 4, and a letter at 5.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess had A at position 3 and said it was present but not at 3. So if we put A at 2, that\'s a new position. That should be acceptable.\n\n However, we must check if such a word exists. Let\'s try ""R A _ C ?"". We need a word: R A ? C ?.\n\n We have to avoid E and N. Let\'s try common letters. For the third position, we can try a vowel? Since we have A already, maybe I, O, U? Or a consonant.\n\n Example: ""R A I L C"" -> no, that\'s 5 letters? Actually, we need 5 letters: positions 1: R, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: C, 5: ?.\n\n How about ""R A I C S""? That\'s not a word. ""R A C K S"" -> but that has C at position 3? We are putting C at 4. So we need a word with the pattern R A ? C ?.\n\n Let me think: ""REACH"" -> but we cannot use E. ""RATCH"" -> that\'s a word? R A T C H -> but that\'s 5 letters? Actually, R A T C H is 5 letters? R-A-T-C-H? But H is the fifth.\n\n But we have to avoid E, and T is allowed. Also, we haven\'t used T before. So ""RATCH"" is a word? I think ""ratch"" is a word (a ratchet). But let me confirm: yes, it\'s a valid word.\n\n However, note: we have the constraint that in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C and we now know that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""RATCH"", C is at position 4. That\'s okay.\n\n But what about the feedback for the first guess? We had:\n   C at 1: present but not here -> in the secret word, C is at 4 -> so when we guess ""crane"", the C at 1 would get (-) because the C is at 4? That\'s correct.\n\n Now, what about R? In the first guess, R was at position 2. In the secret word ""RATCH"", R is at position 1. So when we guessed ""crane"", the R at position 2: the secret word has R at position 1. So the feedback for position 2 would be (-) because R is in the word but not at position 2? That\'s correct.\n\n And A: in the first guess, A was at position 3. In ""RATCH"", A is at position 2. So the feedback for position 3 (A) would be (-) because A is in the word but not at position 3? Correct.\n\n And N and E are absent: so the feedback for N and E was (x) which matches.\n\n So ""RATCH"" seems to fit the feedback? But wait, we haven\'t guessed it yet. We are considering it for the next guess.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the secret word might not be ""RATCH"". We are just trying to find a word that fits the constraints.\n\n But note: we are not required to get it right in the second guess, just to get more information.\n\n However, we have three known letters (C, R, A) and we are using them in ""RATCH"". But we are also introducing T and H. We don\'t know if T and H are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we might try a word that uses more common letters to test other possibilities.\n\n But let\'s see: we have three letters that must be included. We are including them. And we are testing two new letters: T and H.\n\n Another idea: we could try a word that uses the known letters in different positions and also tests other common letters.\n\n Since we know the word has C, R, A, we can try to put them in positions that we haven\'t tested. For example, we haven\'t tested position 5 for any of them.\n\n We might try a word that ends with C? Or with R?\n\n Another common approach is to use a word that doesn\'t repeat the positions we already know are wrong for each letter.\n\n Let me try to list possible positions for each:\n\n   C: can be in 2,3,4,5\n   R: can be in 1,3,4,5\n   A: can be in 1,2,4,5\n\n We can try to assign:\n   Let\'s put R at position 1 (as we did in RATCH) and then A at position 4 and C at position 5? Then we have positions 2 and 3 to fill.\n\n Example: R _ _ A C\n\n Words: ""ROTAC"" -> not a word. ""RUSAC"" -> not a word. ""REBAC"" -> not a word and has E.\n\n Alternatively, put A at position 1? Then we have:\n   A at 1: allowed because the constraint is only that A cannot be at 3.\n   Then R: cannot be at 2, so we can put R at 3,4,5.\n   C: cannot be at 1, so 2,3,4,5.\n\n Example: A _ R _ C -> ""AURIC"" (meaning relating to the ear) -> but that has U and I, and we don\'t know about them. Also, it uses I and U which are vowels. But we don\'t have any feedback about them.\n\n But note: we are avoiding E and N, but U and I are allowed until we know they are absent.\n\n However, in ""AURIC"", we have A at 1 (which is allowed), U at 2 (unknown), R at 3 (but wait: the constraint for R is that it cannot be at 2? It can be at 3. So that\'s okay), I at 4 (unknown), and C at 5 (allowed). \n\n But we must check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and the feedback said A is present but not at 3. Now we are putting A at 1. That\'s a different position, so that\'s okay.\n\n However, we are using two new vowels (U and I). We don\'t know if they are in the word. We might get more information.\n\n But we have to choose one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses common consonants that we haven\'t tried, like T, L, S, etc.\n\n Since we have three known letters, we might try to use a word that has these three and two of the common consonants that we haven\'t eliminated (like T, L, S, H, etc.) and that we haven\'t used (we used C, R, A, and we know N and E are out).\n\n Let me try to think of words that have C, R, A and two of T, L, S.\n\n Example: ""CART S"" -> but that\'s 5 letters? ""CARTS"" -> but we have C at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1 because the feedback said C is not at position 1. So we cannot start with C.\n\n Similarly, we cannot start with C. So we have to avoid C at position 1.\n\n How about ""TRACE""? But we cannot use E. ""TRACK"" -> that has T, R, A, C, K.\n\n Let\'s check the positions in ""TRACK"":\n   T at 1 -> new letter.\n   R at 2 -> but the feedback said R cannot be at position 2! Because in the first guess we had R at 2 and it was present but not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2.\n\n Therefore, ""TRACK"" is invalid because it puts R at 2.\n\n How about ""CRATE""? But we cannot use E.\n\n How about ""CRAWL""? \n   C at 1 -> not allowed (because we know C is not at position 1). So no.\n\n How about ""SCRAP""? \n   S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, A at 4, P at 5.\n   Check constraints:\n      C: at position 2 -> allowed (since C cannot be at 1, but 2 is okay).\n      R: at position 3 -> allowed (since R cannot be at 2, but 3 is okay).\n      A: at position 4 -> allowed (since A cannot be at 3, but 4 is okay).\n   And we are introducing S and P.\n\n So ""SCRAP"" is a valid word and satisfies the constraints.\n\n But wait: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and now we are putting C at position 2. Is that okay? Yes, because the feedback only said C is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at 2.\n\n Similarly, R was at position 2 in the first guess and now we put it at 3 -> that\'s okay because the feedback said R is not at 2, but it could be at 3.\n\n And A was at position 3 in the first guess and now we put it at 4 -> okay.\n\n So ""SCRAP"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n Let me check: if the secret word were ""SCRAP"", then the first guess ""crane"" would have:\n   C at 1: the secret word has C at 2 -> so (-) for C (correct).\n   R at 2: the secret word has R at 3 -> so (-) for R (correct).\n   A at 3: the secret word has A at 4 -> so (-) for A (correct).\n   N at 4: the secret word has S,C,R,A,P -> no N -> (x) (correct).\n   E at 5: not in the word -> (x) (correct).\n\n So ""SCRAP"" is consistent with the feedback.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the secret word is ""SCRAP"". We are just making a guess to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""RATCH"" as we thought earlier. But let\'s compare:\n\n   ""RATCH"": uses T and H, which are common, but we don\'t know if they are in the word.\n   ""SCRAP"": uses S and P, which are also common.\n\n Both are valid. But we have to choose one.\n\n Since we are in the second guess, we want to maximize information. We know the word has C, R, A. We are including them. We are also testing two new letters.\n\n In ""SCRAP"", we are testing S and P. In ""RATCH"", we are testing T and H.\n\n We might choose a word that uses letters that are more common in 5-letter words.\n\n According to letter frequency, T is very common, then S, then H, then P.\n\n But we are testing two letters. We might also consider the positions.\n\n However, we have no information about the other two letters. So either is acceptable.\n\n I\'ll choose ""SCRAP"" because it uses S (which is very common) and P (also common). Also, it places the known letters in positions we haven\'t tried (we tried C at1, now at2; R at2, now at3; A at3, now at4).\n\n So let\'s go with ""SCRAP"".\n\n But note: we must make sure that the word is valid. ""SCRAP"" is a valid English word.\n\n Therefore, our second guess is ""scrap"".\n\n<guess>scrap</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, and A are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively; N and E are absent), I need a second guess that:\n- Includes C, R, and A\n- Avoids N and E\n- Places C, R, and A in new positions (C not in position 1, R not in position 2, A not in position 3)\n- Tests new common letters (e.g., S, T, P, L) to gather more information\n\nThe word ""scrap"" fits these criteria:\n- S (new letter) in position 1\n- C in position 2 (not position 1)\n- R in position 3 (not position 2)\n- A in position 4 (not position 3)\n- P (new letter) in position 5\n\nThis tests S and P while repositioning the known letters. If correct, it could solve the puzzle; if not, the feedback will reveal more about the letter placements and presence of S/P.\n\n<guess>scrap</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: scrap -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) R(-) A(-) P(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
And from the second guess ""scrap"": S(x), C(-), R(-), A(-), P(x)

Let's interpret the feedback:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- N is not in the secret word.
- E is not in the secret word.

From Guess 2 (""scrap""):
- S is not in the secret word (since we got x for S at position 1).
- C is in the secret word but not in position 2 (because in ""scrap"", C is at position 2 and got (-)).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 3 (because in ""scrap"", R is at position 3 and got (-)).
- A is in the secret word but not in position 4 (because in ""scrap"", A is at position 4 and got (-)).
- P is not in the secret word.

We can summarize what we know:

Letters in the word: C, R, A (from both guesses confirming their presence)
Letters not in the word: N, E, S, P (from the x's)

Position constraints (where these letters cannot be):
- C cannot be at position 1 (from guess1) and cannot be at position 2 (from guess2).
- R cannot be at position 2 (from guess1) and cannot be at position 3 (from guess2).
- A cannot be at position 3 (from guess1) and cannot be at position 4 (from guess2).

We also know that the word does not contain: N, E, S, P.

Now, we have three known letters: C, R, A. Since the word is 5 letters, there are two more letters we don't know yet.

We need to think of a word that:
- Contains C, R, A (exactly these three plus two new letters, since no duplicates were indicated? Actually, we don't know if duplicates are possible. But the feedback doesn't show duplicate letters, so let's assume no duplicates for now).
- The two new letters should not be N, E, S, P, and they must be valid English letters.
- Positions: we have to place C, R, A in positions that avoid the constraints, and the two new letters in the remaining positions.

Constraints for the known letters:
- C: cannot be at pos1 or pos2 -> so C must be at pos3, pos4, or pos5?
- R: cannot be at pos2 or pos3 -> so R must be at pos1, pos4, or pos5?
- A: cannot be at pos3 or pos4 -> so A must be at pos1, pos2, or pos5?

But note: each of these must be placed in one position, and they cannot conflict.

Let me try to assign positions:

Consider R: it can be at 1,4,5. Let's assume R is at position 1. Then:
- C: cannot be at1 (but we have R at1) and cannot be at2 -> so C can be at3,4,5.
- A: cannot be at3 or4 -> so A can be at2 or5.

If R is at1, then we can have:
Option A: R at1, A at2, then C at3,4,5? But A is at2: that's allowed because no constraint says A cannot be at2? (only not at3 and not at4). Then we need to place C and the two new letters.

But wait: we have three letters C,R,A and two new. If R is at1, A at2, then we have to place C in one of 3,4,5, and the other two positions for new letters.

But C cannot be at2? We already have A at2, so that's fine.

But check constraints for C: if we put C at3, that would be allowed? Because the constraints for C: only not at1 and not at2? So pos3 is open.

But then the word pattern: R A C _ _ 

But we must have two more letters. Moreover, we have to avoid that A is at2? Actually, we have no constraint that A cannot be at2. Only not at3 and not at4. So A at2 is acceptable.

In this pattern: position3 must be C? But then we have:
Position: 1:R, 2:A, 3:C? 
But check for C: would this conflict? The feedback for C: it was not at pos1 and not at pos2. Now we put it at pos3: that's okay.

But what about R? We put R at1: the constraints for R: cannot be at2 or3? We have it at1: okay.

A at2: constraints: cannot be at3 or4: we have at2: okay.

Now, we need two more letters at positions 4 and 5.

We must avoid N,E,S,P.

So we can consider words like ""RACK? ..."" but R,A,C at positions 1,2,3. Then positions 4 and 5: two letters.

But also, note that the word must be valid. And we haven't used duplicates.

Examples: ""RACKS"" but S is not allowed. ""RACK?"" without S? ""RACED"" but E is not allowed. ""RACER"" but E and R? E is not allowed. ""RACES"" has E and S? Not allowed.

What about ""RACON""? But N is not allowed. 

Alternatively, what about ""RACHT""? That's not a word. 

Another idea: maybe A cannot be at2? We haven't tested it, but the constraints only say A cannot be at3 or4. So 2 is okay.

But we are having trouble finding a word? So perhaps R at1 is not the best? We can try R at4 or5.

Let me try R at4. Then:
- C: can be at3,4,5? But R at4, so C cannot be at4? So C at3 or5.
- A: can be at1,2,5? But if C is at5, then A cannot be at5? So A at1 or2.

Case: R at4.
Option: A at1, then C at3 or5? And position2 and the other between (if C at3, then position5 free; if C at5, then position3 free?).

Suboption 1: R at4, A at1, C at3: pattern: A _ C R _ 
Then the word: A?C R? 
We need to fill positions2 and5. Avoid N,E,S,P.

Possible words: ""ARCH? ..."" but we have A at1, then position2: ?, then C at3, R at4, ? at5. 
Example: ""AICOR"" -> not valid. ""ABHOR"" -> has B and H? Let's check: positions: A,b,h,o,r? But that's A at1, B at2, H at3? but we have C to place? Oh, we have C at3? So H would conflict? 

We have C at3. So must be A?C?R? with ? at2 and5.

With C at3: so the word is A (letter2) C R (letter5). 

Example: ? after A: maybe ""A C R"" with two other letters: ""ACTOR""? But we have ""ACTOR"": A, C, T, O, R -> positions: A at1, C at2? But we have C at3? Oh no: we need pattern A _ C R _ -> so letter at2, then C at3, R at4, letter at5.

""ACTOR"" is A at1, C at2, T at3, O at4, R at5? So that doesn't fit because we need C at3 and R at4.

But ""ACTOR"" has C at2 and R at5? Not matching.

We need a word with: [letter1=A] [letter2=?] [letter3=C] [letter4=R] [letter5=?]

Possible: ""A U C R S"" but S not allowed. ""A U C R ?"" -> ""AUCR?"" -> not a word. 

Another: ""A I C R E""? E not allowed. 

This seems difficult.

Alternative: R at4, A at1, C at5: pattern: A _ _ R C

Then we have positions2 and3 to fill. 

Examples: ""A I R R C""? Duplicate R? Not allowed? Probably no duplicates. ""A D R R C""? No.

Or ""A B R R C""? No.

With no duplicates? Then we can consider ""A D R I C""? But we have C at5? Pattern: A, D, R, I, C? That would be: A at1, D at2, R at3 (but R is at4? Conflict), I at4, C at5? But then R would be at3? But we need R at4? 

Pattern: R at4: so position4 must be R. So the word is: position1:A, position2:?, position3:?, position4:R, position5:C.

So ""A ? ? R C""

Examples: ""A I R R C""? Not valid and duplicates. ""A B R R C""? No.

Words: ""ABRIC"" -> no. ""AURIC"" -> U and I? We cannot use E, N, S, P, but U and I are allowed. But ""AURIC"" is A,U,R,I,C -> which would be: A at1, U at2, R at3, I at4, C at5. But we need R at4? Here R is at3? So not at position4? So that doesn't work.

Perhaps ""A Z R R C""? No.

Maybe it's not possible? So maybe R at4 is difficult.

Try R at5? Then:
- R at5: allowed because not at2 or3.
- Then C: can be at3,4,5? But R at5, so C at3 or4.
- A: can be at1,2,5? But R at5, so A cannot be at5? Thus A at1 or2.

Option: R at5, A at1, C at3 or4.

First, let A at1, C at3: pattern: A _ C _ R
Word: A ? C ? R

Avoid N,E,S,P. We need to fill positions2 and4.

Examples: ""A U C T R"" -> ""AUTRY""? Not valid? We need a word. ""ACTOR"" again: A,C,T,O,R -> A at1, C at2, T at3, O at4, R at5 -> but we need C at3? So not.

If we have C at3: [A] [letter2] [C] [letter4] [R]
Word: ""A ? C ? R""

Try ""A B C D R""? Not a word. ""A I C R R""? Duplicate.

Common words? ""A N C R"" but N is not allowed? And we have 5 letters. 

Maybe ""A C R O S"" but S not allowed and C is at2? We need C at3? 

Notice that we haven't used T, L, etc.

Another idea: ""A F C T R""? Not a word. ""A R C T R""? Duplicate R? Not allowed? 

Let's assume that duplicates are not present until we see feedback suggesting duplicates.

Back to R at position5: what about putting A at2? Then R at5, and C at3 or4.

Option: A at2, R at5, and C at3: pattern: _ A C _ R
Then we need positions1 and4.

Word: ? A C ? R

Examples: ""T A C K R"" -> ""TACKR"" not a word. ""B A C O R"" -> ""BACOR"" not a word. ""F A C T R"" not a word. 

If C at4: pattern: _ A _ C R

Then word: ? A ? C R

Examples: ""B A R C R"" duplicate. ""M A R C R"" duplicate. ""R A C E R"" has E? Not allowed. ""T A L C R"" -> ""TALCR"" not a word? 

Common words: ""T A C R R""? No.

We are having trouble. Maybe reconsider the first case: R at1, but with a different configuration.

Try placing A at5? Then R can be at1 or4 or5? But A at5, so R cannot be at5? So R at1 or4.

Case: R at1, A at5? Then C must be at3 or4? Because we placed R at1 and A at5, so positions 2,3,4 for C and two new letters.

Pattern: R ? ? ? A

But C must be placed: say C at3: then R ? C ? A
Or C at4: R ? ? C A

Also, A at5: which is allowed because A constraints are not at3 or4? 5 is okay.

Also, R at1: allowed.

Now, C cannot be at1 or2? So we don't put it at1? And if we put it at2? Wait, constraints: C cannot be at1 or2. So we cannot put C at2? Therefore, C must be at3 or4.

First, C at3: R ? C ? A
Then positions2 and4 must be filled with new letters (not N,E,S,P).

Examples: ""R U C ? A"" -> ""RULCA"" not a word? ""R U C K A"" -> ""RUCKA"" not a word. ""R I C E A"" but E not allowed. 

With C at4: R ? ? C A, then positions2 and3.

Examples: ""R O C C A""? Duplicate C? ""R O M C A"" -> ""ROMCA"" not a word. ""R U M C A"" not a word.

This is problematic.

We must not forget that there could be a letter that we haven't considered that forms a valid word.

Maybe the letter 'T' is common. Let me try to incorporate T.

Consider R at1, then let's put A at a positions that works.

We had R at1, A at2? Then C must be at3,4,5.

But we were stuck with the last two positions? We need to find a word that ends with ... for positions3,4,5.

If C at3: R A C ? ? 
Words: ""R A C K S"" -> S not allowed and K hasn't been tested? ""R A C H T"" -> not a word? ""R A C Y M""? Not a word.

If C at4: R A ? C ? 
Then word: R A ? C ?

Avoiding the bad letters, let’s try ""R A T C H"": ""RATCH"" is a word? But we already considered it earlier? But in guess2 we got feedback for ""scrap"" which said P is not in the word? But ""RATCH"" has T and H. And we don't know if T and H are in the word? But we are going to test it.

Recall: S and P are out, but T and H might be in? We don't know.

So if we guess ""RATCH"", it contains T and H which are new.

And it satisfies:
- R at1: doesn't violate constraints (R cannot be at2 or3, but we have at1: okay)
- A at2: constraints only say A cannot be at3 or4, so at2 is okay.
- T at3: new letter, not known to be absent.
- C at4: constraints say C cannot be at1 or2? At4 is okay.
- H at5: new letter.

We also must ensure that C is at4: in the feedback, we know C is not at1 or2, but we are putting it at4, which is allowed.

The word ""RATCH"" is a valid English word (meaning: a ratchet or a small delay).

Therefore, we can guess ""RATCH"" and see the feedback.

But note, we tried ""RATCH"" earlier and now we are going to guess it.

Alternatively, another possibility: maybe C at5? With R at1, A at2. Then pattern: R A ? ? C
With positions3 and4 to fill.

Avoid N,E,S,P. So for example: ""R A T T C"" duplicate T? And not a word. ""R A I L C"" but L and C at5? But we have I at3 and L at4? ""RAILC"" not a word? ""RALLY"" has two L's? And ends with Y? But we have to end with C? ""R A L ? C"" -> ""RALLC"" not valid.

So ""RATCH"" seems like a candidate.

But let's cross-verify with the feedback we have.

From guess1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
In ""RATCH"": 
- If secret word is ""RATCH"", then:
  - C is at position4? ""crane"" had C at1 -> would give (-) because present but not at1? Correct.
  - R at position1? But guess1 had R at2 -> would give (-) because present but not at2? Correct.
  - A at position2? guess1 had A at3 -> (-) because not at3? Correct.
  - N and E: not in secret word: (x) correct.

From guess2: ""scrap"" -> S(x), C(-) because C is at4? but guess2 had C at2 -> secret C at4 -> (-) correct? 
R(-) because R is at1? guess2 had R at3 -> secret R at1 -> present but not at3 -> (-) correct?
A(-) because A is at2? guess2 had A at4 -> secret A at2 -> present but not at4 -> (-) correct?
S(x) -> secret has no S: correct? P(x) -> no P: correct.

So ""RATCH"" is consistent with the feedback so far.

But is it the only possibility? No, but it's a good guess because it uses known letters and tests two new ones.

We might also consider ""F R A C T"" but F and T? And R cannot be at position2? Because we put it at position2? In ""FRACT"": 
- F at1
- R at2 -> but constraint: R cannot be at position2? From the first feedback? Yes, from guess1: R was at2 and we got (-), meaning R is not at2? So we cannot put R at2? 

So we must avoid R at2.

Thus, ""RATCH"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""RATCH"".

But note: the previous guess ""scrap"" had C at2, so C cannot be at2? We are now putting C at4? So that's okay.

Guess: ""RATCH""
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R, and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively. N and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""scrap"")**: C, R, and A are confirmed present but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 respectively. S and P are absent.

### Known Information:
- **Letters in the word**: C, R, A (100% confirmed).
- **Letters NOT in the word**: N, E, S, P (excluded based on ""x"" feedback).
- **Position constraints**:
  - C cannot be in position 1 or 2.
  - R cannot be in position 2 or 3.
  - A cannot be in position 3 or 4.
- We need a 5-letter word containing **C, R, A** and two new letters (not N, E, S, or P), respecting the constraints.

### Reasoning for the Guess:
To maximize information, I chose a word that:
1. Uses the known letters (C, R, A) in positions not ruled out by constraints:
   - **R**: Placed at position 1 (allowed, since R avoids positions 2/3).
   - **A**: Placed at position 2 (allowed, since A avoids positions 3/4).
   - **C**: Placed at position 4 (allowed, since C avoids positions 1/2).
2. Tests two new common letters (**T** and **H**) to gather more information if incorrect.
3. The word **RATCH**:
   - Is a valid English word (meaning: a ratchet or slight delay).
   - Fits all feedback:
     - ""crane"": C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x) → consistent.
     - ""scrap"": S(x), C(-), R(-), A(-), P(x) → consistent.

<guess>ratch</guess>",ratch,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
And from the second guess ""scrap"": S(x), C(-), R(-), A(-), P(x)

Let's interpret the feedback:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- N is not in the secret word.
- E is not in the secret word.

From Guess 2 (""scrap""):
- S is not in the secret word (since we got x for S at position 1).
- C is in the secret word but not in position 2 (because in ""scrap"", C is at position 2 and got (-)).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 3 (because in ""scrap"", R is at position 3 and got (-)).
- A is in the secret word but not in position 4 (because in ""scrap"", A is at position 4 and got (-)).
- P is not in the secret word.

We can summarize what we know:

Letters in the word: C, R, A (from both guesses confirming their presence)
Letters not in the word: N, E, S, P (from the x's)

Position constraints (where these letters cannot be):
- C cannot be at position 1 (from guess1) and cannot be at position 2 (from guess2).
- R cannot be at position 2 (from guess1) and cannot be at position 3 (from guess2).
- A cannot be at position 3 (from guess1) and cannot be at position 4 (from guess2).

We also know that the word does not contain: N, E, S, P.

Now, we have three known letters: C, R, A. Since the word is 5 letters, there are two more letters we don't know yet.

We need to think of a word that:
- Contains C, R, A (exactly these three plus two new letters, since no duplicates were indicated? Actually, we don't know if duplicates are possible. But the feedback doesn't show duplicate letters, so let's assume no duplicates for now).
- The two new letters should not be N, E, S, P, and they must be valid English letters.
- Positions: we have to place C, R, A in positions that avoid the constraints, and the two new letters in the remaining positions.

Constraints for the known letters:
- C: cannot be at pos1 or pos2 -> so C must be at pos3, pos4, or pos5?
- R: cannot be at pos2 or pos3 -> so R must be at pos1, pos4, or pos5?
- A: cannot be at pos3 or pos4 -> so A must be at pos1, pos2, or pos5?

But note: each of these must be placed in one position, and they cannot conflict.

Let me try to assign positions:

Consider R: it can be at 1,4,5. Let's assume R is at position 1. Then:
- C: cannot be at1 (but we have R at1) and cannot be at2 -> so C can be at3,4,5.
- A: cannot be at3 or4 -> so A can be at2 or5.

If R is at1, then we can have:
Option A: R at1, A at2, then C at3,4,5? But A is at2: that's allowed because no constraint says A cannot be at2? (only not at3 and not at4). Then we need to place C and the two new letters.

But wait: we have three letters C,R,A and two new. If R is at1, A at2, then we have to place C in one of 3,4,5, and the other two positions for new letters.

But C cannot be at2? We already have A at2, so that's fine.

But check constraints for C: if we put C at3, that would be allowed? Because the constraints for C: only not at1 and not at2? So pos3 is open.

But then the word pattern: R A C _ _ 

But we must have two more letters. Moreover, we have to avoid that A is at2? Actually, we have no constraint that A cannot be at2. Only not at3 and not at4. So A at2 is acceptable.

In this pattern: position3 must be C? But then we have:
Position: 1:R, 2:A, 3:C? 
But check for C: would this conflict? The feedback for C: it was not at pos1 and not at pos2. Now we put it at pos3: that's okay.

But what about R? We put R at1: the constraints for R: cannot be at2 or3? We have it at1: okay.

A at2: constraints: cannot be at3 or4: we have at2: okay.

Now, we need two more letters at positions 4 and 5.

We must avoid N,E,S,P.

So we can consider words like ""RACK? ..."" but R,A,C at positions 1,2,3. Then positions 4 and 5: two letters.

But also, note that the word must be valid. And we haven't used duplicates.

Examples: ""RACKS"" but S is not allowed. ""RACK?"" without S? ""RACED"" but E is not allowed. ""RACER"" but E and R? E is not allowed. ""RACES"" has E and S? Not allowed.

What about ""RACON""? But N is not allowed. 

Alternatively, what about ""RACHT""? That's not a word. 

Another idea: maybe A cannot be at2? We haven't tested it, but the constraints only say A cannot be at3 or4. So 2 is okay.

But we are having trouble finding a word? So perhaps R at1 is not the best? We can try R at4 or5.

Let me try R at4. Then:
- C: can be at3,4,5? But R at4, so C cannot be at4? So C at3 or5.
- A: can be at1,2,5? But if C is at5, then A cannot be at5? So A at1 or2.

Case: R at4.
Option: A at1, then C at3 or5? And position2 and the other between (if C at3, then position5 free; if C at5, then position3 free?).

Suboption 1: R at4, A at1, C at3: pattern: A _ C R _ 
Then the word: A?C R? 
We need to fill positions2 and5. Avoid N,E,S,P.

Possible words: ""ARCH? ..."" but we have A at1, then position2: ?, then C at3, R at4, ? at5. 
Example: ""AICOR"" -> not valid. ""ABHOR"" -> has B and H? Let's check: positions: A,b,h,o,r? But that's A at1, B at2, H at3? but we have C to place? Oh, we have C at3? So H would conflict? 

We have C at3. So must be A?C?R? with ? at2 and5.

With C at3: so the word is A (letter2) C R (letter5). 

Example: ? after A: maybe ""A C R"" with two other letters: ""ACTOR""? But we have ""ACTOR"": A, C, T, O, R -> positions: A at1, C at2? But we have C at3? Oh no: we need pattern A _ C R _ -> so letter at2, then C at3, R at4, letter at5.

""ACTOR"" is A at1, C at2, T at3, O at4, R at5? So that doesn't fit because we need C at3 and R at4.

But ""ACTOR"" has C at2 and R at5? Not matching.

We need a word with: [letter1=A] [letter2=?] [letter3=C] [letter4=R] [letter5=?]

Possible: ""A U C R S"" but S not allowed. ""A U C R ?"" -> ""AUCR?"" -> not a word. 

Another: ""A I C R E""? E not allowed. 

This seems difficult.

Alternative: R at4, A at1, C at5: pattern: A _ _ R C

Then we have positions2 and3 to fill. 

Examples: ""A I R R C""? Duplicate R? Not allowed? Probably no duplicates. ""A D R R C""? No.

Or ""A B R R C""? No.

With no duplicates? Then we can consider ""A D R I C""? But we have C at5? Pattern: A, D, R, I, C? That would be: A at1, D at2, R at3 (but R is at4? Conflict), I at4, C at5? But then R would be at3? But we need R at4? 

Pattern: R at4: so position4 must be R. So the word is: position1:A, position2:?, position3:?, position4:R, position5:C.

So ""A ? ? R C""

Examples: ""A I R R C""? Not valid and duplicates. ""A B R R C""? No.

Words: ""ABRIC"" -> no. ""AURIC"" -> U and I? We cannot use E, N, S, P, but U and I are allowed. But ""AURIC"" is A,U,R,I,C -> which would be: A at1, U at2, R at3, I at4, C at5. But we need R at4? Here R is at3? So not at position4? So that doesn't work.

Perhaps ""A Z R R C""? No.

Maybe it's not possible? So maybe R at4 is difficult.

Try R at5? Then:
- R at5: allowed because not at2 or3.
- Then C: can be at3,4,5? But R at5, so C at3 or4.
- A: can be at1,2,5? But R at5, so A cannot be at5? Thus A at1 or2.

Option: R at5, A at1, C at3 or4.

First, let A at1, C at3: pattern: A _ C _ R
Word: A ? C ? R

Avoid N,E,S,P. We need to fill positions2 and4.

Examples: ""A U C T R"" -> ""AUTRY""? Not valid? We need a word. ""ACTOR"" again: A,C,T,O,R -> A at1, C at2, T at3, O at4, R at5 -> but we need C at3? So not.

If we have C at3: [A] [letter2] [C] [letter4] [R]
Word: ""A ? C ? R""

Try ""A B C D R""? Not a word. ""A I C R R""? Duplicate.

Common words? ""A N C R"" but N is not allowed? And we have 5 letters. 

Maybe ""A C R O S"" but S not allowed and C is at2? We need C at3? 

Notice that we haven't used T, L, etc.

Another idea: ""A F C T R""? Not a word. ""A R C T R""? Duplicate R? Not allowed? 

Let's assume that duplicates are not present until we see feedback suggesting duplicates.

Back to R at position5: what about putting A at2? Then R at5, and C at3 or4.

Option: A at2, R at5, and C at3: pattern: _ A C _ R
Then we need positions1 and4.

Word: ? A C ? R

Examples: ""T A C K R"" -> ""TACKR"" not a word. ""B A C O R"" -> ""BACOR"" not a word. ""F A C T R"" not a word. 

If C at4: pattern: _ A _ C R

Then word: ? A ? C R

Examples: ""B A R C R"" duplicate. ""M A R C R"" duplicate. ""R A C E R"" has E? Not allowed. ""T A L C R"" -> ""TALCR"" not a word? 

Common words: ""T A C R R""? No.

We are having trouble. Maybe reconsider the first case: R at1, but with a different configuration.

Try placing A at5? Then R can be at1 or4 or5? But A at5, so R cannot be at5? So R at1 or4.

Case: R at1, A at5? Then C must be at3 or4? Because we placed R at1 and A at5, so positions 2,3,4 for C and two new letters.

Pattern: R ? ? ? A

But C must be placed: say C at3: then R ? C ? A
Or C at4: R ? ? C A

Also, A at5: which is allowed because A constraints are not at3 or4? 5 is okay.

Also, R at1: allowed.

Now, C cannot be at1 or2? So we don't put it at1? And if we put it at2? Wait, constraints: C cannot be at1 or2. So we cannot put C at2? Therefore, C must be at3 or4.

First, C at3: R ? C ? A
Then positions2 and4 must be filled with new letters (not N,E,S,P).

Examples: ""R U C ? A"" -> ""RULCA"" not a word? ""R U C K A"" -> ""RUCKA"" not a word. ""R I C E A"" but E not allowed. 

With C at4: R ? ? C A, then positions2 and3.

Examples: ""R O C C A""? Duplicate C? ""R O M C A"" -> ""ROMCA"" not a word. ""R U M C A"" not a word.

This is problematic.

We must not forget that there could be a letter that we haven't considered that forms a valid word.

Maybe the letter 'T' is common. Let me try to incorporate T.

Consider R at1, then let's put A at a positions that works.

We had R at1, A at2? Then C must be at3,4,5.

But we were stuck with the last two positions? We need to find a word that ends with ... for positions3,4,5.

If C at3: R A C ? ? 
Words: ""R A C K S"" -> S not allowed and K hasn't been tested? ""R A C H T"" -> not a word? ""R A C Y M""? Not a word.

If C at4: R A ? C ? 
Then word: R A ? C ?

Avoiding the bad letters, let’s try ""R A T C H"": ""RATCH"" is a word? But we already considered it earlier? But in guess2 we got feedback for ""scrap"" which said P is not in the word? But ""RATCH"" has T and H. And we don't know if T and H are in the word? But we are going to test it.

Recall: S and P are out, but T and H might be in? We don't know.

So if we guess ""RATCH"", it contains T and H which are new.

And it satisfies:
- R at1: doesn't violate constraints (R cannot be at2 or3, but we have at1: okay)
- A at2: constraints only say A cannot be at3 or4, so at2 is okay.
- T at3: new letter, not known to be absent.
- C at4: constraints say C cannot be at1 or2? At4 is okay.
- H at5: new letter.

We also must ensure that C is at4: in the feedback, we know C is not at1 or2, but we are putting it at4, which is allowed.

The word ""RATCH"" is a valid English word (meaning: a ratchet or a small delay).

Therefore, we can guess ""RATCH"" and see the feedback.

But note, we tried ""RATCH"" earlier and now we are going to guess it.

Alternatively, another possibility: maybe C at5? With R at1, A at2. Then pattern: R A ? ? C
With positions3 and4 to fill.

Avoid N,E,S,P. So for example: ""R A T T C"" duplicate T? And not a word. ""R A I L C"" but L and C at5? But we have I at3 and L at4? ""RAILC"" not a word? ""RALLY"" has two L's? And ends with Y? But we have to end with C? ""R A L ? C"" -> ""RALLC"" not valid.

So ""RATCH"" seems like a candidate.

But let's cross-verify with the feedback we have.

From guess1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
In ""RATCH"": 
- If secret word is ""RATCH"", then:
  - C is at position4? ""crane"" had C at1 -> would give (-) because present but not at1? Correct.
  - R at position1? But guess1 had R at2 -> would give (-) because present but not at2? Correct.
  - A at position2? guess1 had A at3 -> (-) because not at3? Correct.
  - N and E: not in secret word: (x) correct.

From guess2: ""scrap"" -> S(x), C(-) because C is at4? but guess2 had C at2 -> secret C at4 -> (-) correct? 
R(-) because R is at1? guess2 had R at3 -> secret R at1 -> present but not at3 -> (-) correct?
A(-) because A is at2? guess2 had A at4 -> secret A at2 -> present but not at4 -> (-) correct?
S(x) -> secret has no S: correct? P(x) -> no P: correct.

So ""RATCH"" is consistent with the feedback so far.

But is it the only possibility? No, but it's a good guess because it uses known letters and tests two new ones.

We might also consider ""F R A C T"" but F and T? And R cannot be at position2? Because we put it at position2? In ""FRACT"": 
- F at1
- R at2 -> but constraint: R cannot be at position2? From the first feedback? Yes, from guess1: R was at2 and we got (-), meaning R is not at2? So we cannot put R at2? 

So we must avoid R at2.

Thus, ""RATCH"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""RATCH"".

But note: the previous guess ""scrap"" had C at2, so C cannot be at2? We are now putting C at4? So that's okay.

Guess: ""RATCH""After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R, and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively. N and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""scrap"")**: C, R, and A are confirmed present but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 respectively. S and P are absent.

### Known Information:
- **Letters in the word**: C, R, A (100% confirmed).
- **Letters NOT in the word**: N, E, S, P (excluded based on ""x"" feedback).
- **Position constraints**:
  - C cannot be in position 1 or 2.
  - R cannot be in position 2 or 3.
  - A cannot be in position 3 or 4.
- We need a 5-letter word containing **C, R, A** and two new letters (not N, E, S, or P), respecting the constraints.

### Reasoning for the Guess:
To maximize information, I chose a word that:
1. Uses the known letters (C, R, A) in positions not ruled out by constraints:
   - **R**: Placed at position 1 (allowed, since R avoids positions 2/3).
   - **A**: Placed at position 2 (allowed, since A avoids positions 3/4).
   - **C**: Placed at position 4 (allowed, since C avoids positions 1/2).
2. Tests two new common letters (**T** and **H**) to gather more information if incorrect.
3. The word **RATCH**:
   - Is a valid English word (meaning: a ratchet or slight delay).
   - Fits all feedback:
     - ""crane"": C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x) → consistent.
     - ""scrap"": S(x), C(-), R(-), A(-), P(x) → consistent.",Guess 3: ratch -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) C(-) H(x),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
 This means:
   - C is in the secret word but not in the first position.
   - R is in the secret word but not in the second position.
   - A is in the secret word but not in the third position.
   - N is not in the secret word.
   - E is not in the secret word.

 So, the secret word contains the letters C, R, and A, but not in the positions we guessed. Also, it does not contain N or E.

 Since we know the secret word has C, R, and A, and we have three positions where they are misplaced, we can try a new word that:
   - Does not use N or E (since they are absent).
   - Places C, R, and A in different positions than the first guess (positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively).

 Additionally, we should avoid using the same letters again unless we are testing other positions.

 We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Let's think of a word that includes C, R, A and two new letters (since we have three known letters and two more to find).

 We have to avoid positions:
   - C cannot be in position 1.
   - R cannot be in position 2.
   - A cannot be in position 3.

 We can try to put C in position 2, 3, 4, or 5; R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5; A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

 But note: we also have two more letters to guess.

 Since we have three known letters (C, R, A) and two unknown, we might try a word that rearranges these and adds two new common consonants.

 However, we must also consider that the feedback told us that in the first guess, the first three letters were all present but misplaced. So the word must have C, R, A in positions other than 1,2,3? Not exactly: it could have one of them in the first three but in a different position? Actually, the feedback says:
   Position 1: C is present but not here -> so C is in the word but not at position 1.
   Position 2: R is present but not here -> so R is in the word but not at position 2.
   Position 3: A is present but not here -> so A is in the word but not at position 3.

 So the word has C, R, A, and they are in positions that are not 1, 2, 3 respectively.

 But note: they could be in any of the other positions. For example, C could be in position 2? Actually, no: because if C were in position 2, then in the first guess we had C at position 1 and the secret word has C at position 2, then the feedback for position 1 would be (-) meaning it's in the word but not here, and for position 2 we had R which is not C so that would be separate. But the feedback for position 2 was R(-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. So the secret word has R somewhere else.

 We have to form a word that has C, R, A and two other letters (excluding N and E).

 Let's try to think of words that have C, R, A and two other consonants (since vowels are limited: we already have A and we know E is out, so we might use I, O, U, but we don't know if they are present).

 We can try to use a word that puts C, R, A in positions that are not 1,2,3? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we have five positions.

 We might try to put C in position 4 or 5, R in position 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2), and A in position 1,2,4,5 (but not 3). However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

 Let's try to use R in the first position? That would be allowed because the feedback only said R is not in position 2, but it could be in position 1.

 Similarly, A could be in position 1? But then we have R and A both wanting position 1? We can't. So we have to assign each letter to a different position.

 We have three letters: C, R, A. We need to assign them to three different positions from the set {1,2,3,4,5} with the constraints:
   - C cannot be at 1.
   - R cannot be at 2.
   - A cannot be at 3.

 We also have two more letters to fill.

 Let me try to think of words that start with R? Because R is a common starting letter.

 Example: ""R"" at position 1. Then we have to place C and A in positions 2,3,4,5 but with constraints:
   - C cannot be at 1 (already taken by R) -> okay, but also C must be in the word and not at 1 (which we already satisfied).
   - A cannot be at 3.

 So if we put R at 1, then we can put A at 2? But the constraint for A is only that it cannot be at 3. So A can be at 2. Then we can put C at 4 or 5.

 Then we have two more letters to fill at positions 3 and 5 (if we put C at 4) or 3 and 4 (if we put C at 5). But note: we cannot use N or E.

 Also, we must avoid putting A at 3? Actually, we are putting A at 2, so that's okay.

 So a candidate: R at 1, A at 2, then we need a letter at 3, then C at 4, and a letter at 5.

 But wait: the feedback for the first guess had A at position 3 and said it was present but not at 3. So if we put A at 2, that's a new position. That should be acceptable.

 However, we must check if such a word exists. Let's try ""R A _ C ?"". We need a word: R A ? C ?.

 We have to avoid E and N. Let's try common letters. For the third position, we can try a vowel? Since we have A already, maybe I, O, U? Or a consonant.

 Example: ""R A I L C"" -> no, that's 5 letters? Actually, we need 5 letters: positions 1: R, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: C, 5: ?.

 How about ""R A I C S""? That's not a word. ""R A C K S"" -> but that has C at position 3? We are putting C at 4. So we need a word with the pattern R A ? C ?.

 Let me think: ""REACH"" -> but we cannot use E. ""RATCH"" -> that's a word? R A T C H -> but that's 5 letters? Actually, R A T C H is 5 letters? R-A-T-C-H? But H is the fifth.

 But we have to avoid E, and T is allowed. Also, we haven't used T before. So ""RATCH"" is a word? I think ""ratch"" is a word (a ratchet). But let me confirm: yes, it's a valid word.

 However, note: we have the constraint that in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C and we now know that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""RATCH"", C is at position 4. That's okay.

 But what about the feedback for the first guess? We had:
   C at 1: present but not here -> in the secret word, C is at 4 -> so when we guess ""crane"", the C at 1 would get (-) because the C is at 4? That's correct.

 Now, what about R? In the first guess, R was at position 2. In the secret word ""RATCH"", R is at position 1. So when we guessed ""crane"", the R at position 2: the secret word has R at position 1. So the feedback for position 2 would be (-) because R is in the word but not at position 2? That's correct.

 And A: in the first guess, A was at position 3. In ""RATCH"", A is at position 2. So the feedback for position 3 (A) would be (-) because A is in the word but not at position 3? Correct.

 And N and E are absent: so the feedback for N and E was (x) which matches.

 So ""RATCH"" seems to fit the feedback? But wait, we haven't guessed it yet. We are considering it for the next guess.

 However, we must be cautious: the secret word might not be ""RATCH"". We are just trying to find a word that fits the constraints.

 But note: we are not required to get it right in the second guess, just to get more information.

 However, we have three known letters (C, R, A) and we are using them in ""RATCH"". But we are also introducing T and H. We don't know if T and H are in the word.

 Alternatively, we might try a word that uses more common letters to test other possibilities.

 But let's see: we have three letters that must be included. We are including them. And we are testing two new letters: T and H.

 Another idea: we could try a word that uses the known letters in different positions and also tests other common letters.

 Since we know the word has C, R, A, we can try to put them in positions that we haven't tested. For example, we haven't tested position 5 for any of them.

 We might try a word that ends with C? Or with R?

 Another common approach is to use a word that doesn't repeat the positions we already know are wrong for each letter.

 Let me try to list possible positions for each:

   C: can be in 2,3,4,5
   R: can be in 1,3,4,5
   A: can be in 1,2,4,5

 We can try to assign:
   Let's put R at position 1 (as we did in RATCH) and then A at position 4 and C at position 5? Then we have positions 2 and 3 to fill.

 Example: R _ _ A C

 Words: ""ROTAC"" -> not a word. ""RUSAC"" -> not a word. ""REBAC"" -> not a word and has E.

 Alternatively, put A at position 1? Then we have:
   A at 1: allowed because the constraint is only that A cannot be at 3.
   Then R: cannot be at 2, so we can put R at 3,4,5.
   C: cannot be at 1, so 2,3,4,5.

 Example: A _ R _ C -> ""AURIC"" (meaning relating to the ear) -> but that has U and I, and we don't know about them. Also, it uses I and U which are vowels. But we don't have any feedback about them.

 But note: we are avoiding E and N, but U and I are allowed until we know they are absent.

 However, in ""AURIC"", we have A at 1 (which is allowed), U at 2 (unknown), R at 3 (but wait: the constraint for R is that it cannot be at 2? It can be at 3. So that's okay), I at 4 (unknown), and C at 5 (allowed). 

 But we must check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and the feedback said A is present but not at 3. Now we are putting A at 1. That's a different position, so that's okay.

 However, we are using two new vowels (U and I). We don't know if they are in the word. We might get more information.

 But we have to choose one.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that uses common consonants that we haven't tried, like T, L, S, etc.

 Since we have three known letters, we might try to use a word that has these three and two of the common consonants that we haven't eliminated (like T, L, S, H, etc.) and that we haven't used (we used C, R, A, and we know N and E are out).

 Let me try to think of words that have C, R, A and two of T, L, S.

 Example: ""CART S"" -> but that's 5 letters? ""CARTS"" -> but we have C at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1 because the feedback said C is not at position 1. So we cannot start with C.

 Similarly, we cannot start with C. So we have to avoid C at position 1.

 How about ""TRACE""? But we cannot use E. ""TRACK"" -> that has T, R, A, C, K.

 Let's check the positions in ""TRACK"":
   T at 1 -> new letter.
   R at 2 -> but the feedback said R cannot be at position 2! Because in the first guess we had R at 2 and it was present but not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2.

 Therefore, ""TRACK"" is invalid because it puts R at 2.

 How about ""CRATE""? But we cannot use E.

 How about ""CRAWL""? 
   C at 1 -> not allowed (because we know C is not at position 1). So no.

 How about ""SCRAP""? 
   S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, A at 4, P at 5.
   Check constraints:
      C: at position 2 -> allowed (since C cannot be at 1, but 2 is okay).
      R: at position 3 -> allowed (since R cannot be at 2, but 3 is okay).
      A: at position 4 -> allowed (since A cannot be at 3, but 4 is okay).
   And we are introducing S and P.

 So ""SCRAP"" is a valid word and satisfies the constraints.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and now we are putting C at position 2. Is that okay? Yes, because the feedback only said C is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at 2.

 Similarly, R was at position 2 in the first guess and now we put it at 3 -> that's okay because the feedback said R is not at 2, but it could be at 3.

 And A was at position 3 in the first guess and now we put it at 4 -> okay.

 So ""SCRAP"" seems like a good candidate.

 Let me check: if the secret word were ""SCRAP"", then the first guess ""crane"" would have:
   C at 1: the secret word has C at 2 -> so (-) for C (correct).
   R at 2: the secret word has R at 3 -> so (-) for R (correct).
   A at 3: the secret word has A at 4 -> so (-) for A (correct).
   N at 4: the secret word has S,C,R,A,P -> no N -> (x) (correct).
   E at 5: not in the word -> (x) (correct).

 So ""SCRAP"" is consistent with the feedback.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word is ""SCRAP"". We are just making a guess to get more information.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RATCH"" as we thought earlier. But let's compare:

   ""RATCH"": uses T and H, which are common, but we don't know if they are in the word.
   ""SCRAP"": uses S and P, which are also common.

 Both are valid. But we have to choose one.

 Since we are in the second guess, we want to maximize information. We know the word has C, R, A. We are including them. We are also testing two new letters.

 In ""SCRAP"", we are testing S and P. In ""RATCH"", we are testing T and H.

 We might choose a word that uses letters that are more common in 5-letter words.

 According to letter frequency, T is very common, then S, then H, then P.

 But we are testing two letters. We might also consider the positions.

 However, we have no information about the other two letters. So either is acceptable.

 I'll choose ""SCRAP"" because it uses S (which is very common) and P (also common). Also, it places the known letters in positions we haven't tried (we tried C at1, now at2; R at2, now at3; A at3, now at4).

 So let's go with ""SCRAP"".

 But note: we must make sure that the word is valid. ""SCRAP"" is a valid English word.

 Therefore, our second guess is ""scrap"".

<guess>scrap</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, and A are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively; N and E are absent), I need a second guess that:
- Includes C, R, and A
- Avoids N and E
- Places C, R, and A in new positions (C not in position 1, R not in position 2, A not in position 3)
- Tests new common letters (e.g., S, T, P, L) to gather more information

The word ""scrap"" fits these criteria:
- S (new letter) in position 1
- C in position 2 (not position 1)
- R in position 3 (not position 2)
- A in position 4 (not position 3)
- P (new letter) in position 5

This tests S and P while repositioning the known letters. If correct, it could solve the puzzle; if not, the feedback will reveal more about the letter placements and presence of S/P.

<guess>scrap</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: scrap -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) R(-) A(-) P(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
And from the second guess ""scrap"": S(x), C(-), R(-), A(-), P(x)

Let's interpret the feedback:

From Guess 1 (""crane""):
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1.
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- A is in the secret word but not in position 3.
- N is not in the secret word.
- E is not in the secret word.

From Guess 2 (""scrap""):
- S is not in the secret word (since we got x for S at position 1).
- C is in the secret word but not in position 2 (because in ""scrap"", C is at position 2 and got (-)).
- R is in the secret word but not in position 3 (because in ""scrap"", R is at position 3 and got (-)).
- A is in the secret word but not in position 4 (because in ""scrap"", A is at position 4 and got (-)).
- P is not in the secret word.

We can summarize what we know:

Letters in the word: C, R, A (from both guesses confirming their presence)
Letters not in the word: N, E, S, P (from the x's)

Position constraints (where these letters cannot be):
- C cannot be at position 1 (from guess1) and cannot be at position 2 (from guess2).
- R cannot be at position 2 (from guess1) and cannot be at position 3 (from guess2).
- A cannot be at position 3 (from guess1) and cannot be at position 4 (from guess2).

We also know that the word does not contain: N, E, S, P.

Now, we have three known letters: C, R, A. Since the word is 5 letters, there are two more letters we don't know yet.

We need to think of a word that:
- Contains C, R, A (exactly these three plus two new letters, since no duplicates were indicated? Actually, we don't know if duplicates are possible. But the feedback doesn't show duplicate letters, so let's assume no duplicates for now).
- The two new letters should not be N, E, S, P, and they must be valid English letters.
- Positions: we have to place C, R, A in positions that avoid the constraints, and the two new letters in the remaining positions.

Constraints for the known letters:
- C: cannot be at pos1 or pos2 -> so C must be at pos3, pos4, or pos5?
- R: cannot be at pos2 or pos3 -> so R must be at pos1, pos4, or pos5?
- A: cannot be at pos3 or pos4 -> so A must be at pos1, pos2, or pos5?

But note: each of these must be placed in one position, and they cannot conflict.

Let me try to assign positions:

Consider R: it can be at 1,4,5. Let's assume R is at position 1. Then:
- C: cannot be at1 (but we have R at1) and cannot be at2 -> so C can be at3,4,5.
- A: cannot be at3 or4 -> so A can be at2 or5.

If R is at1, then we can have:
Option A: R at1, A at2, then C at3,4,5? But A is at2: that's allowed because no constraint says A cannot be at2? (only not at3 and not at4). Then we need to place C and the two new letters.

But wait: we have three letters C,R,A and two new. If R is at1, A at2, then we have to place C in one of 3,4,5, and the other two positions for new letters.

But C cannot be at2? We already have A at2, so that's fine.

But check constraints for C: if we put C at3, that would be allowed? Because the constraints for C: only not at1 and not at2? So pos3 is open.

But then the word pattern: R A C _ _ 

But we must have two more letters. Moreover, we have to avoid that A is at2? Actually, we have no constraint that A cannot be at2. Only not at3 and not at4. So A at2 is acceptable.

In this pattern: position3 must be C? But then we have:
Position: 1:R, 2:A, 3:C? 
But check for C: would this conflict? The feedback for C: it was not at pos1 and not at pos2. Now we put it at pos3: that's okay.

But what about R? We put R at1: the constraints for R: cannot be at2 or3? We have it at1: okay.

A at2: constraints: cannot be at3 or4: we have at2: okay.

Now, we need two more letters at positions 4 and 5.

We must avoid N,E,S,P.

So we can consider words like ""RACK? ..."" but R,A,C at positions 1,2,3. Then positions 4 and 5: two letters.

But also, note that the word must be valid. And we haven't used duplicates.

Examples: ""RACKS"" but S is not allowed. ""RACK?"" without S? ""RACED"" but E is not allowed. ""RACER"" but E and R? E is not allowed. ""RACES"" has E and S? Not allowed.

What about ""RACON""? But N is not allowed. 

Alternatively, what about ""RACHT""? That's not a word. 

Another idea: maybe A cannot be at2? We haven't tested it, but the constraints only say A cannot be at3 or4. So 2 is okay.

But we are having trouble finding a word? So perhaps R at1 is not the best? We can try R at4 or5.

Let me try R at4. Then:
- C: can be at3,4,5? But R at4, so C cannot be at4? So C at3 or5.
- A: can be at1,2,5? But if C is at5, then A cannot be at5? So A at1 or2.

Case: R at4.
Option: A at1, then C at3 or5? And position2 and the other between (if C at3, then position5 free; if C at5, then position3 free?).

Suboption 1: R at4, A at1, C at3: pattern: A _ C R _ 
Then the word: A?C R? 
We need to fill positions2 and5. Avoid N,E,S,P.

Possible words: ""ARCH? ..."" but we have A at1, then position2: ?, then C at3, R at4, ? at5. 
Example: ""AICOR"" -> not valid. ""ABHOR"" -> has B and H? Let's check: positions: A,b,h,o,r? But that's A at1, B at2, H at3? but we have C to place? Oh, we have C at3? So H would conflict? 

We have C at3. So must be A?C?R? with ? at2 and5.

With C at3: so the word is A (letter2) C R (letter5). 

Example: ? after A: maybe ""A C R"" with two other letters: ""ACTOR""? But we have ""ACTOR"": A, C, T, O, R -> positions: A at1, C at2? But we have C at3? Oh no: we need pattern A _ C R _ -> so letter at2, then C at3, R at4, letter at5.

""ACTOR"" is A at1, C at2, T at3, O at4, R at5? So that doesn't fit because we need C at3 and R at4.

But ""ACTOR"" has C at2 and R at5? Not matching.

We need a word with: [letter1=A] [letter2=?] [letter3=C] [letter4=R] [letter5=?]

Possible: ""A U C R S"" but S not allowed. ""A U C R ?"" -> ""AUCR?"" -> not a word. 

Another: ""A I C R E""? E not allowed. 

This seems difficult.

Alternative: R at4, A at1, C at5: pattern: A _ _ R C

Then we have positions2 and3 to fill. 

Examples: ""A I R R C""? Duplicate R? Not allowed? Probably no duplicates. ""A D R R C""? No.

Or ""A B R R C""? No.

With no duplicates? Then we can consider ""A D R I C""? But we have C at5? Pattern: A, D, R, I, C? That would be: A at1, D at2, R at3 (but R is at4? Conflict), I at4, C at5? But then R would be at3? But we need R at4? 

Pattern: R at4: so position4 must be R. So the word is: position1:A, position2:?, position3:?, position4:R, position5:C.

So ""A ? ? R C""

Examples: ""A I R R C""? Not valid and duplicates. ""A B R R C""? No.

Words: ""ABRIC"" -> no. ""AURIC"" -> U and I? We cannot use E, N, S, P, but U and I are allowed. But ""AURIC"" is A,U,R,I,C -> which would be: A at1, U at2, R at3, I at4, C at5. But we need R at4? Here R is at3? So not at position4? So that doesn't work.

Perhaps ""A Z R R C""? No.

Maybe it's not possible? So maybe R at4 is difficult.

Try R at5? Then:
- R at5: allowed because not at2 or3.
- Then C: can be at3,4,5? But R at5, so C at3 or4.
- A: can be at1,2,5? But R at5, so A cannot be at5? Thus A at1 or2.

Option: R at5, A at1, C at3 or4.

First, let A at1, C at3: pattern: A _ C _ R
Word: A ? C ? R

Avoid N,E,S,P. We need to fill positions2 and4.

Examples: ""A U C T R"" -> ""AUTRY""? Not valid? We need a word. ""ACTOR"" again: A,C,T,O,R -> A at1, C at2, T at3, O at4, R at5 -> but we need C at3? So not.

If we have C at3: [A] [letter2] [C] [letter4] [R]
Word: ""A ? C ? R""

Try ""A B C D R""? Not a word. ""A I C R R""? Duplicate.

Common words? ""A N C R"" but N is not allowed? And we have 5 letters. 

Maybe ""A C R O S"" but S not allowed and C is at2? We need C at3? 

Notice that we haven't used T, L, etc.

Another idea: ""A F C T R""? Not a word. ""A R C T R""? Duplicate R? Not allowed? 

Let's assume that duplicates are not present until we see feedback suggesting duplicates.

Back to R at position5: what about putting A at2? Then R at5, and C at3 or4.

Option: A at2, R at5, and C at3: pattern: _ A C _ R
Then we need positions1 and4.

Word: ? A C ? R

Examples: ""T A C K R"" -> ""TACKR"" not a word. ""B A C O R"" -> ""BACOR"" not a word. ""F A C T R"" not a word. 

If C at4: pattern: _ A _ C R

Then word: ? A ? C R

Examples: ""B A R C R"" duplicate. ""M A R C R"" duplicate. ""R A C E R"" has E? Not allowed. ""T A L C R"" -> ""TALCR"" not a word? 

Common words: ""T A C R R""? No.

We are having trouble. Maybe reconsider the first case: R at1, but with a different configuration.

Try placing A at5? Then R can be at1 or4 or5? But A at5, so R cannot be at5? So R at1 or4.

Case: R at1, A at5? Then C must be at3 or4? Because we placed R at1 and A at5, so positions 2,3,4 for C and two new letters.

Pattern: R ? ? ? A

But C must be placed: say C at3: then R ? C ? A
Or C at4: R ? ? C A

Also, A at5: which is allowed because A constraints are not at3 or4? 5 is okay.

Also, R at1: allowed.

Now, C cannot be at1 or2? So we don't put it at1? And if we put it at2? Wait, constraints: C cannot be at1 or2. So we cannot put C at2? Therefore, C must be at3 or4.

First, C at3: R ? C ? A
Then positions2 and4 must be filled with new letters (not N,E,S,P).

Examples: ""R U C ? A"" -> ""RULCA"" not a word? ""R U C K A"" -> ""RUCKA"" not a word. ""R I C E A"" but E not allowed. 

With C at4: R ? ? C A, then positions2 and3.

Examples: ""R O C C A""? Duplicate C? ""R O M C A"" -> ""ROMCA"" not a word. ""R U M C A"" not a word.

This is problematic.

We must not forget that there could be a letter that we haven't considered that forms a valid word.

Maybe the letter 'T' is common. Let me try to incorporate T.

Consider R at1, then let's put A at a positions that works.

We had R at1, A at2? Then C must be at3,4,5.

But we were stuck with the last two positions? We need to find a word that ends with ... for positions3,4,5.

If C at3: R A C ? ? 
Words: ""R A C K S"" -> S not allowed and K hasn't been tested? ""R A C H T"" -> not a word? ""R A C Y M""? Not a word.

If C at4: R A ? C ? 
Then word: R A ? C ?

Avoiding the bad letters, let’s try ""R A T C H"": ""RATCH"" is a word? But we already considered it earlier? But in guess2 we got feedback for ""scrap"" which said P is not in the word? But ""RATCH"" has T and H. And we don't know if T and H are in the word? But we are going to test it.

Recall: S and P are out, but T and H might be in? We don't know.

So if we guess ""RATCH"", it contains T and H which are new.

And it satisfies:
- R at1: doesn't violate constraints (R cannot be at2 or3, but we have at1: okay)
- A at2: constraints only say A cannot be at3 or4, so at2 is okay.
- T at3: new letter, not known to be absent.
- C at4: constraints say C cannot be at1 or2? At4 is okay.
- H at5: new letter.

We also must ensure that C is at4: in the feedback, we know C is not at1 or2, but we are putting it at4, which is allowed.

The word ""RATCH"" is a valid English word (meaning: a ratchet or a small delay).

Therefore, we can guess ""RATCH"" and see the feedback.

But note, we tried ""RATCH"" earlier and now we are going to guess it.

Alternatively, another possibility: maybe C at5? With R at1, A at2. Then pattern: R A ? ? C
With positions3 and4 to fill.

Avoid N,E,S,P. So for example: ""R A T T C"" duplicate T? And not a word. ""R A I L C"" but L and C at5? But we have I at3 and L at4? ""RAILC"" not a word? ""RALLY"" has two L's? And ends with Y? But we have to end with C? ""R A L ? C"" -> ""RALLC"" not valid.

So ""RATCH"" seems like a candidate.

But let's cross-verify with the feedback we have.

From guess1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
In ""RATCH"": 
- If secret word is ""RATCH"", then:
  - C is at position4? ""crane"" had C at1 -> would give (-) because present but not at1? Correct.
  - R at position1? But guess1 had R at2 -> would give (-) because present but not at2? Correct.
  - A at position2? guess1 had A at3 -> (-) because not at3? Correct.
  - N and E: not in secret word: (x) correct.

From guess2: ""scrap"" -> S(x), C(-) because C is at4? but guess2 had C at2 -> secret C at4 -> (-) correct? 
R(-) because R is at1? guess2 had R at3 -> secret R at1 -> present but not at3 -> (-) correct?
A(-) because A is at2? guess2 had A at4 -> secret A at2 -> present but not at4 -> (-) correct?
S(x) -> secret has no S: correct? P(x) -> no P: correct.

So ""RATCH"" is consistent with the feedback so far.

But is it the only possibility? No, but it's a good guess because it uses known letters and tests two new ones.

We might also consider ""F R A C T"" but F and T? And R cannot be at position2? Because we put it at position2? In ""FRACT"": 
- F at1
- R at2 -> but constraint: R cannot be at position2? From the first feedback? Yes, from guess1: R was at2 and we got (-), meaning R is not at2? So we cannot put R at2? 

So we must avoid R at2.

Thus, ""RATCH"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""RATCH"".

But note: the previous guess ""scrap"" had C at2, so C cannot be at2? We are now putting C at4? So that's okay.

Guess: ""RATCH""After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R, and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively. N and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""scrap"")**: C, R, and A are confirmed present but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 respectively. S and P are absent.

### Known Information:
- **Letters in the word**: C, R, A (100% confirmed).
- **Letters NOT in the word**: N, E, S, P (excluded based on ""x"" feedback).
- **Position constraints**:
  - C cannot be in position 1 or 2.
  - R cannot be in position 2 or 3.
  - A cannot be in position 3 or 4.
- We need a 5-letter word containing **C, R, A** and two new letters (not N, E, S, or P), respecting the constraints.

### Reasoning for the Guess:
To maximize information, I chose a word that:
1. Uses the known letters (C, R, A) in positions not ruled out by constraints:
   - **R**: Placed at position 1 (allowed, since R avoids positions 2/3).
   - **A**: Placed at position 2 (allowed, since A avoids positions 3/4).
   - **C**: Placed at position 4 (allowed, since C avoids positions 1/2).
2. Tests two new common letters (**T** and **H**) to gather more information if incorrect.
3. The word **RATCH**:
   - Is a valid English word (meaning: a ratchet or slight delay).
   - Fits all feedback:
     - ""crane"": C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x) → consistent.
     - ""scrap"": S(x), C(-), R(-), A(-), P(x) → consistent.

Also, it does not contain N or E.\n\n Since we know the secret word has C, R, and A, and we have three positions where they are misplaced, we can try a new word that:\n   - Does not use N or E (since they are absent).\n   - Places C, R, and A in different positions than the first guess (positions 1, 2, and 3 respectively).\n\n Additionally, we should avoid using the same letters again unless we are testing other positions.\n\n We also know that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that includes C, R, A and two new letters (since we have three known letters and two more to find).\n\n We have to avoid positions:\n   - C cannot be in position 1.\n   - R cannot be in position 2.\n   - A cannot be in position 3.\n\n We can try to put C in position 2, 3, 4, or 5; R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5; A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n But note: we also have two more letters to guess.\n\n Since we have three known letters (C, R, A) and two unknown, we might try a word that rearranges these and adds two new common consonants.\n\n However, we must also consider that the feedback told us that in the first guess, the first three letters were all present but misplaced. So the word must have C, R, A in positions other than 1,2,3? Not exactly: it could have one of them in the first three but in a different position? Actually, the feedback says:\n   Position 1: C is present but not here -> so C is in the word but not at position 1.\n   Position 2: R is present but not here -> so R is in the word but not at position 2.\n   Position 3: A is present but not here -> so A is in the word but not at position 3.\n\n So the word has C, R, A, and they are in positions that are not 1, 2, 3 respectively.\n\n But note: they could be in any of the other positions. For example, C could be in position 2? Actually, no: because if C were in position 2, then in the first guess we had C at position 1 and the secret word has C at position 2, then the feedback for position 1 would be (-) meaning it\'s in the word but not here, and for position 2 we had R which is not C so that would be separate. But the feedback for position 2 was R(-) meaning R is in the word but not at position 2. So the secret word has R somewhere else.\n\n We have to form a word that has C, R, A and two other letters (excluding N and E).\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have C, R, A and two other consonants (since vowels are limited: we already have A and we know E is out, so we might use I, O, U, but we don\'t know if they are present).\n\n We can try to use a word that puts C, R, A in positions that are not 1,2,3? Actually, we can put them in any position except the ones we know they are not. But note: we have five positions.\n\n We might try to put C in position 4 or 5, R in position 1, 3, 4, 5 (but not 2), and A in position 1,2,4,5 (but not 3). However, we also have to consider that the word must be valid.\n\n Let\'s try to use R in the first position? That would be allowed because the feedback only said R is not in position 2, but it could be in position 1.\n\n Similarly, A could be in position 1? But then we have R and A both wanting position 1? We can\'t. So we have to assign each letter to a different position.\n\n We have three letters: C, R, A. We need to assign them to three different positions from the set {1,2,3,4,5} with the constraints:\n   - C cannot be at 1.\n   - R cannot be at 2.\n   - A cannot be at 3.\n\n We also have two more letters to fill.\n\n Let me try to think of words that start with R? Because R is a common starting letter.\n\n Example: ""R"" at position 1. Then we have to place C and A in positions 2,3,4,5 but with constraints:\n   - C cannot be at 1 (already taken by R) -> okay, but also C must be in the word and not at 1 (which we already satisfied).\n   - A cannot be at 3.\n\n So if we put R at 1, then we can put A at 2? But the constraint for A is only that it cannot be at 3. So A can be at 2. Then we can put C at 4 or 5.\n\n Then we have two more letters to fill at positions 3 and 5 (if we put C at 4) or 3 and 4 (if we put C at 5). But note: we cannot use N or E.\n\n Also, we must avoid putting A at 3? Actually, we are putting A at 2, so that\'s okay.\n\n So a candidate: R at 1, A at 2, then we need a letter at 3, then C at 4, and a letter at 5.\n\n But wait: the feedback for the first guess had A at position 3 and said it was present but not at 3. So if we put A at 2, that\'s a new position. That should be acceptable.\n\n However, we must check if such a word exists. Let\'s try ""R A _ C ?"". We need a word: R A ? C ?.\n\n We have to avoid E and N. Let\'s try common letters. For the third position, we can try a vowel? Since we have A already, maybe I, O, U? Or a consonant.\n\n Example: ""R A I L C"" -> no, that\'s 5 letters? Actually, we need 5 letters: positions 1: R, 2: A, 3: ?, 4: C, 5: ?.\n\n How about ""R A I C S""? That\'s not a word. ""R A C K S"" -> but that has C at position 3? We are putting C at 4. So we need a word with the pattern R A ? C ?.\n\n Let me think: ""REACH"" -> but we cannot use E. ""RATCH"" -> that\'s a word? R A T C H -> but that\'s 5 letters? Actually, R A T C H is 5 letters? R-A-T-C-H? But H is the fifth.\n\n But we have to avoid E, and T is allowed. Also, we haven\'t used T before. So ""RATCH"" is a word? I think ""ratch"" is a word (a ratchet). But let me confirm: yes, it\'s a valid word.\n\n However, note: we have the constraint that in the first guess, the letter at position 1 was C and we now know that C is in the word but not at position 1. In ""RATCH"", C is at position 4. That\'s okay.\n\n But what about the feedback for the first guess? We had:\n   C at 1: present but not here -> in the secret word, C is at 4 -> so when we guess ""crane"", the C at 1 would get (-) because the C is at 4? That\'s correct.\n\n Now, what about R? In the first guess, R was at position 2. In the secret word ""RATCH"", R is at position 1. So when we guessed ""crane"", the R at position 2: the secret word has R at position 1. So the feedback for position 2 would be (-) because R is in the word but not at position 2? That\'s correct.\n\n And A: in the first guess, A was at position 3. In ""RATCH"", A is at position 2. So the feedback for position 3 (A) would be (-) because A is in the word but not at position 3? Correct.\n\n And N and E are absent: so the feedback for N and E was (x) which matches.\n\n So ""RATCH"" seems to fit the feedback? But wait, we haven\'t guessed it yet. We are considering it for the next guess.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the secret word might not be ""RATCH"". We are just trying to find a word that fits the constraints.\n\n But note: we are not required to get it right in the second guess, just to get more information.\n\n However, we have three known letters (C, R, A) and we are using them in ""RATCH"". But we are also introducing T and H. We don\'t know if T and H are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we might try a word that uses more common letters to test other possibilities.\n\n But let\'s see: we have three letters that must be included. We are including them. And we are testing two new letters: T and H.\n\n Another idea: we could try a word that uses the known letters in different positions and also tests other common letters.\n\n Since we know the word has C, R, A, we can try to put them in positions that we haven\'t tested. For example, we haven\'t tested position 5 for any of them.\n\n We might try a word that ends with C? Or with R?\n\n Another common approach is to use a word that doesn\'t repeat the positions we already know are wrong for each letter.\n\n Let me try to list possible positions for each:\n\n   C: can be in 2,3,4,5\n   R: can be in 1,3,4,5\n   A: can be in 1,2,4,5\n\n We can try to assign:\n   Let\'s put R at position 1 (as we did in RATCH) and then A at position 4 and C at position 5? Then we have positions 2 and 3 to fill.\n\n Example: R _ _ A C\n\n Words: ""ROTAC"" -> not a word. ""RUSAC"" -> not a word. ""REBAC"" -> not a word and has E.\n\n Alternatively, put A at position 1? Then we have:\n   A at 1: allowed because the constraint is only that A cannot be at 3.\n   Then R: cannot be at 2, so we can put R at 3,4,5.\n   C: cannot be at 1, so 2,3,4,5.\n\n Example: A _ R _ C -> ""AURIC"" (meaning relating to the ear) -> but that has U and I, and we don\'t know about them. Also, it uses I and U which are vowels. But we don\'t have any feedback about them.\n\n But note: we are avoiding E and N, but U and I are allowed until we know they are absent.\n\n However, in ""AURIC"", we have A at 1 (which is allowed), U at 2 (unknown), R at 3 (but wait: the constraint for R is that it cannot be at 2? It can be at 3. So that\'s okay), I at 4 (unknown), and C at 5 (allowed). \n\n But we must check: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and the feedback said A is present but not at 3. Now we are putting A at 1. That\'s a different position, so that\'s okay.\n\n However, we are using two new vowels (U and I). We don\'t know if they are in the word. We might get more information.\n\n But we have to choose one.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that uses common consonants that we haven\'t tried, like T, L, S, etc.\n\n Since we have three known letters, we might try to use a word that has these three and two of the common consonants that we haven\'t eliminated (like T, L, S, H, etc.) and that we haven\'t used (we used C, R, A, and we know N and E are out).\n\n Let me try to think of words that have C, R, A and two of T, L, S.\n\n Example: ""CART S"" -> but that\'s 5 letters? ""CARTS"" -> but we have C at position 1? We cannot put C at position 1 because the feedback said C is not at position 1. So we cannot start with C.\n\n Similarly, we cannot start with C. So we have to avoid C at position 1.\n\n How about ""TRACE""? But we cannot use E. ""TRACK"" -> that has T, R, A, C, K.\n\n Let\'s check the positions in ""TRACK"":\n   T at 1 -> new letter.\n   R at 2 -> but the feedback said R cannot be at position 2! Because in the first guess we had R at 2 and it was present but not at 2. So we cannot put R at 2.\n\n Therefore, ""TRACK"" is invalid because it puts R at 2.\n\n How about ""CRATE""? But we cannot use E.\n\n How about ""CRAWL""? \n   C at 1 -> not allowed (because we know C is not at position 1). So no.\n\n How about ""SCRAP""? \n   S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, A at 4, P at 5.\n   Check constraints:\n      C: at position 2 -> allowed (since C cannot be at 1, but 2 is okay).\n      R: at position 3 -> allowed (since R cannot be at 2, but 3 is okay).\n      A: at position 4 -> allowed (since A cannot be at 3, but 4 is okay).\n   And we are introducing S and P.\n\n So ""SCRAP"" is a valid word and satisfies the constraints.\n\n But wait: in the first guess, we had C at position 1 and now we are putting C at position 2. Is that okay? Yes, because the feedback only said C is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at 2.\n\n Similarly, R was at position 2 in the first guess and now we put it at 3 -> that\'s okay because the feedback said R is not at 2, but it could be at 3.\n\n And A was at position 3 in the first guess and now we put it at 4 -> okay.\n\n So ""SCRAP"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n Let me check: if the secret word were ""SCRAP"", then the first guess ""crane"" would have:\n   C at 1: the secret word has C at 2 -> so (-) for C (correct).\n   R at 2: the secret word has R at 3 -> so (-) for R (correct).\n   A at 3: the secret word has A at 4 -> so (-) for A (correct).\n   N at 4: the secret word has S,C,R,A,P -> no N -> (x) (correct).\n   E at 5: not in the word -> (x) (correct).\n\n So ""SCRAP"" is consistent with the feedback.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the secret word is ""SCRAP"". We are just making a guess to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""RATCH"" as we thought earlier. But let\'s compare:\n\n   ""RATCH"": uses T and H, which are common, but we don\'t know if they are in the word.\n   ""SCRAP"": uses S and P, which are also common.\n\n Both are valid. But we have to choose one.\n\n Since we are in the second guess, we want to maximize information. We know the word has C, R, A. We are including them. We are also testing two new letters.\n\n In ""SCRAP"", we are testing S and P. In ""RATCH"", we are testing T and H.\n\n We might choose a word that uses letters that are more common in 5-letter words.\n\n According to letter frequency, T is very common, then S, then H, then P.\n\n But we are testing two letters. We might also consider the positions.\n\n However, we have no information about the other two letters. So either is acceptable.\n\n I\'ll choose ""SCRAP"" because it uses S (which is very common) and P (also common). Also, it places the known letters in positions we haven\'t tried (we tried C at1, now at2; R at2, now at3; A at3, now at4).\n\n So let\'s go with ""SCRAP"".\n\n But note: we must make sure that the word is valid. ""SCRAP"" is a valid English word.\n\n Therefore, our second guess is ""scrap"".\n\n<guess>scrap</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C, R, and A are in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively; N and E are absent), I need a second guess that:\n- Includes C, R, and A\n- Avoids N and E\n- Places C, R, and A in new positions (C not in position 1, R not in position 2, A not in position 3)\n- Tests new common letters (e.g., S, T, P, L) to gather more information\n\nThe word ""scrap"" fits these criteria:\n- S (new letter) in position 1\n- C in position 2 (not position 1)\n- R in position 3 (not position 2)\n- A in position 4 (not position 3)\n- P (new letter) in position 5\n\nThis tests S and P while repositioning the known letters.

Since the word is 5 letters, there are two more letters we don\'t know yet.\n\nWe need to think of a word that:\n- Contains C, R, A (exactly these three plus two new letters, since no duplicates were indicated? Actually, we don\'t know if duplicates are possible. But the feedback doesn\'t show duplicate letters, so let\'s assume no duplicates for now).\n- The two new letters should not be N, E, S, P, and they must be valid English letters.\n- Positions: we have to place C, R, A in positions that avoid the constraints, and the two new letters in the remaining positions.\n\nConstraints for the known letters:\n- C: cannot be at pos1 or pos2 -> so C must be at pos3, pos4, or pos5?\n- R: cannot be at pos2 or pos3 -> so R must be at pos1, pos4, or pos5?\n- A: cannot be at pos3 or pos4 -> so A must be at pos1, pos2, or pos5?\n\nBut note: each of these must be placed in one position, and they cannot conflict.\n\nLet me try to assign positions:\n\nConsider R: it can be at 1,4,5. Let\'s assume R is at position 1. Then:\n- C: cannot be at1 (but we have R at1) and cannot be at2 -> so C can be at3,4,5.\n- A: cannot be at3 or4 -> so A can be at2 or5.\n\nIf R is at1, then we can have:\nOption A: R at1, A at2, then C at3,4,5? But A is at2: that\'s allowed because no constraint says A cannot be at2? (only not at3 and not at4). Then we need to place C and the two new letters.\n\nBut wait: we have three letters C,R,A and two new. If R is at1, A at2, then we have to place C in one of 3,4,5, and the other two positions for new letters.\n\nBut C cannot be at2? We already have A at2, so that\'s fine.\n\nBut check constraints for C: if we put C at3, that would be allowed? Because the constraints for C: only not at1 and not at2? So pos3 is open.\n\nBut then the word pattern: R A C _ _ \n\nBut we must have two more letters. Moreover, we have to avoid that A is at2? Actually, we have no constraint that A cannot be at2. Only not at3 and not at4. So A at2 is acceptable.\n\nIn this pattern: position3 must be C? But then we have:\nPosition: 1:R, 2:A, 3:C? \nBut check for C: would this conflict? The feedback for C: it was not at pos1 and not at pos2. Now we put it at pos3: that\'s okay.\n\nBut what about R? We put R at1: the constraints for R: cannot be at2 or3? We have it at1: okay.\n\nA at2: constraints: cannot be at3 or4: we have at2: okay.\n\nNow, we need two more letters at positions 4 and 5.\n\nWe must avoid N,E,S,P.\n\nSo we can consider words like ""RACK? ..."" but R,A,C at positions 1,2,3. Then positions 4 and 5: two letters.\n\nBut also, note that the word must be valid. And we haven\'t used duplicates.\n\nExamples: ""RACKS"" but S is not allowed. ""RACK?"" without S? ""RACED"" but E is not allowed. ""RACER"" but E and R? E is not allowed. ""RACES"" has E and S? Not allowed.\n\nWhat about ""RACON""? But N is not allowed. \n\nAlternatively, what about ""RACHT""? That\'s not a word. \n\nAnother idea: maybe A cannot be at2? We haven\'t tested it, but the constraints only say A cannot be at3 or4. So 2 is okay.\n\nBut we are having trouble finding a word? So perhaps R at1 is not the best? We can try R at4 or5.\n\nLet me try R at4. Then:\n- C: can be at3,4,5? But R at4, so C cannot be at4? So C at3 or5.\n- A: can be at1,2,5? But if C is at5, then A cannot be at5? So A at1 or2.\n\nCase: R at4.\nOption: A at1, then C at3 or5? And position2 and the other between (if C at3, then position5 free; if C at5, then position3 free?).\n\nSuboption 1: R at4, A at1, C at3: pattern: A _ C R _ \nThen the word: A?C R? \nWe need to fill positions2 and5. Avoid N,E,S,P.\n\nPossible words: ""ARCH? ..."" but we have A at1, then position2: ?, then C at3, R at4, ? at5. \nExample: ""AICOR"" -> not valid. ""ABHOR"" -> has B and H? Let\'s check: positions: A,b,h,o,r? But that\'s A at1, B at2, H at3? but we have C to place? Oh, we have C at3? So H would conflict? \n\nWe have C at3. So must be A?C?R? with ? at2 and5.\n\nWith C at3: so the word is A (letter2) C R (letter5). \n\nExample: ? after A: maybe ""A C R"" with two other letters: ""ACTOR""? But we have ""ACTOR"": A, C, T, O, R -> positions: A at1, C at2? But we have C at3? Oh no: we need pattern A _ C R _ -> so letter at2, then C at3, R at4, letter at5.\n\n""ACTOR"" is A at1, C at2, T at3, O at4, R at5? So that doesn\'t fit because we need C at3 and R at4.\n\nBut ""ACTOR"" has C at2 and R at5? Not matching.\n\nWe need a word with: [letter1=A] [letter2=?] [letter3=C] [letter4=R] [letter5=?]\n\nPossible: ""A U C R S"" but S not allowed. ""A U C R ?"" -> ""AUCR?"" -> not a word. \n\nAnother: ""A I C R E""? E not allowed. \n\nThis seems difficult.\n\nAlternative: R at4, A at1, C at5: pattern: A _ _ R C\n\nThen we have positions2 and3 to fill. \n\nExamples: ""A I R R C""? Duplicate R? Not allowed? Probably no duplicates. ""A D R R C""? No.\n\nOr ""A B R R C""? No.\n\nWith no duplicates? Then we can consider ""A D R I C""? But we have C at5? Pattern: A, D, R, I, C? That would be: A at1, D at2, R at3 (but R is at4? Conflict), I at4, C at5? But then R would be at3? But we need R at4? \n\nPattern: R at4: so position4 must be R. So the word is: position1:A, position2:?, position3:?, position4:R, position5:C.\n\nSo ""A ? ? R C""\n\nExamples: ""A I R R C""? Not valid and duplicates. ""A B R R C""? No.\n\nWords: ""ABRIC"" -> no. ""AURIC"" -> U and I? We cannot use E, N, S, P, but U and I are allowed. But ""AURIC"" is A,U,R,I,C -> which would be: A at1, U at2, R at3, I at4, C at5. But we need R at4? Here R is at3? So not at position4? So that doesn\'t work.\n\nPerhaps ""A Z R R C""? No.\n\nMaybe it\'s not possible? So maybe R at4 is difficult.\n\nTry R at5? Then:\n- R at5: allowed because not at2 or3.\n- Then C: can be at3,4,5? But R at5, so C at3 or4.\n- A: can be at1,2,5? But R at5, so A cannot be at5? Thus A at1 or2.\n\nOption: R at5, A at1, C at3 or4.\n\nFirst, let A at1, C at3: pattern: A _ C _ R\nWord: A ? C ? R\n\nAvoid N,E,S,P. We need to fill positions2 and4.\n\nExamples: ""A U C T R"" -> ""AUTRY""? Not valid? We need a word. ""ACTOR"" again: A,C,T,O,R -> A at1, C at2, T at3, O at4, R at5 -> but we need C at3? So not.\n\nIf we have C at3: [A] [letter2] [C] [letter4] [R]\nWord: ""A ? C ? R""\n\nTry ""A B C D R""? Not a word. ""A I C R R""? Duplicate.\n\nCommon words? ""A N C R"" but N is not allowed? And we have 5 letters. \n\nMaybe ""A C R O S"" but S not allowed and C is at2? We need C at3? \n\nNotice that we haven\'t used T, L, etc.\n\nAnother idea: ""A F C T R""? Not a word. ""A R C T R""? Duplicate R? Not allowed? \n\nLet\'s assume that duplicates are not present until we see feedback suggesting duplicates.\n\nBack to R at position5: what about putting A at2? Then R at5, and C at3 or4.\n\nOption: A at2, R at5, and C at3: pattern: _ A C _ R\nThen we need positions1 and4.\n\nWord: ? A C ? R\n\nExamples: ""T A C K R"" -> ""TACKR"" not a word. ""B A C O R"" -> ""BACOR"" not a word. ""F A C T R"" not a word. \n\nIf C at4: pattern: _ A _ C R\n\nThen word: ? A ? C R\n\nExamples: ""B A R C R"" duplicate. ""M A R C R"" duplicate. ""R A C E R"" has E? Not allowed. ""T A L C R"" -> ""TALCR"" not a word? \n\nCommon words: ""T A C R R""? No.\n\nWe are having trouble. Maybe reconsider the first case: R at1, but with a different configuration.\n\nTry placing A at5? Then R can be at1 or4 or5? But A at5, so R cannot be at5? So R at1 or4.\n\nCase: R at1, A at5? Then C must be at3 or4? Because we placed R at1 and A at5, so positions 2,3,4 for C and two new letters.\n\nPattern: R ? ? ? A\n\nBut C must be placed: say C at3: then R ? C ? A\nOr C at4: R ? ? C A\n\nAlso, A at5: which is allowed because A constraints are not at3 or4? 5 is okay.\n\nAlso, R at1: allowed.\n\nNow, C cannot be at1 or2? So we don\'t put it at1? And if we put it at2? Wait, constraints: C cannot be at1 or2. So we cannot put C at2? Therefore, C must be at3 or4.\n\nFirst, C at3: R ? C ? A\nThen positions2 and4 must be filled with new letters (not N,E,S,P).\n\nExamples: ""R U C ? A"" -> ""RULCA"" not a word? ""R U C K A"" -> ""RUCKA"" not a word. ""R I C E A"" but E not allowed. \n\nWith C at4: R ? ? C A, then positions2 and3.\n\nExamples: ""R O C C A""? Duplicate C? ""R O M C A"" -> ""ROMCA"" not a word. ""R U M C A"" not a word.\n\nThis is problematic.\n\nWe must not forget that there could be a letter that we haven\'t considered that forms a valid word.\n\nMaybe the letter \'T\' is common. Let me try to incorporate T.\n\nConsider R at1, then let\'s put A at a positions that works.\n\nWe had R at1, A at2? Then C must be at3,4,5.\n\nBut we were stuck with the last two positions? We need to find a word that ends with ... for positions3,4,5.\n\nIf C at3: R A C ? ? \nWords: ""R A C K S"" -> S not allowed and K hasn\'t been tested? ""R A C H T"" -> not a word? ""R A C Y M""? Not a word.\n\nIf C at4: R A ? C ? \nThen word: R A ? C ?\n\nAvoiding the bad letters, let’s try ""R A T C H"": ""RATCH"" is a word? But we already considered it earlier? But in guess2 we got feedback for ""scrap"" which said P is not in the word? But ""RATCH"" has T and H. And we don\'t know if T and H are in the word? But we are going to test it.\n\nRecall: S and P are out, but T and H might be in? We don\'t know.\n\nSo if we guess ""RATCH"", it contains T and H which are new.\n\nAnd it satisfies:\n- R at1: doesn\'t violate constraints (R cannot be at2 or3, but we have at1: okay)\n- A at2: constraints only say A cannot be at3 or4, so at2 is okay.\n- T at3: new letter, not known to be absent.\n- C at4: constraints say C cannot be at1 or2? At4 is okay.\n- H at5: new letter.\n\nWe also must ensure that C is at4: in the feedback, we know C is not at1 or2, but we are putting it at4, which is allowed.\n\nThe word ""RATCH"" is a valid English word (meaning: a ratchet or a small delay).\n\nTherefore, we can guess ""RATCH"" and see the feedback.\n\nBut note, we tried ""RATCH"" earlier and now we are going to guess it.\n\nAlternatively, another possibility: maybe C at5? With R at1, A at2. Then pattern: R A ? ? C\nWith positions3 and4 to fill.\n\nAvoid N,E,S,P. So for example: ""R A T T C"" duplicate T? And not a word. ""R A I L C"" but L and C at5? But we have I at3 and L at4? ""RAILC"" not a word? ""RALLY"" has two L\'s? And ends with Y? But we have to end with C? ""R A L ? C"" -> ""RALLC"" not valid.\n\nSo ""RATCH"" seems like a candidate.\n\nBut let\'s cross-verify with the feedback we have.\n\nFrom guess1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)\nIn ""RATCH"": \n- If secret word is ""RATCH"", then:\n  - C is at position4? ""crane"" had C at1 -> would give (-) because present but not at1? Correct.\n  - R at position1? But guess1 had R at2 -> would give (-) because present but not at2? Correct.\n  - A at position2? guess1 had A at3 -> (-) because not at3? Correct.\n  - N and E: not in secret word: (x) correct.\n\nFrom guess2: ""scrap"" -> S(x), C(-) because C is at4? but guess2 had C at2 -> secret C at4 -> (-) correct? \nR(-) because R is at1? guess2 had R at3 -> secret R at1 -> present but not at3 -> (-) correct?\nA(-) because A is at2? guess2 had A at4 -> secret A at2 -> present but not at4 -> (-) correct?\nS(x) -> secret has no S: correct? P(x) -> no P: correct.\n\nSo ""RATCH"" is consistent with the feedback so far.\n\nBut is it the only possibility? No, but it\'s a good guess because it uses known letters and tests two new ones.\n\nWe might also consider ""F R A C T"" but F and T? And R cannot be at position2? Because we put it at position2? In ""FRACT"": \n- F at1\n- R at2 -> but constraint: R cannot be at position2? From the first feedback? Yes, from guess1: R was at2 and we got (-), meaning R is not at2? So we cannot put R at2? \n\nSo we must avoid R at2.\n\nThus, ""RATCH"" is a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, I will guess ""RATCH"".\n\nBut note: the previous guess ""scrap"" had C at2, so C cannot be at2? We are now putting C at4? So that\'s okay.\n\nGuess: ""RATCH""After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: C, R, and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively. N and E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (""scrap"")**: C, R, and A are confirmed present but not in positions 2, 3, or 4 respectively. S and P are absent.\n\n### Known Information:\n- **Letters in the word**: C, R, A (100% confirmed).\n- **Letters NOT in the word**: N, E, S, P (excluded based on ""x"" feedback).\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - C cannot be in position 1 or 2.\n  - R cannot be in position 2 or 3.\n  - A cannot be in position 3 or 4.\n- We need a 5-letter word containing **C, R, A** and two new letters (not N, E, S, or P), respecting the constraints.\n\n### Reasoning for the Guess:\nTo maximize information, I chose a word that:\n1. Uses the known letters (C, R, A) in positions not ruled out by constraints:\n   - **R**: Placed at position 1 (allowed, since R avoids positions 2/3).\n   - **A**: Placed at position 2 (allowed, since A avoids positions 3/4).\n   - **C**: Placed at position 4 (allowed, since C avoids positions 1/2).\n2. Tests two new common letters (**T** and **H**) to gather more information if incorrect.\n3. The word **RATCH**:\n   - Is a valid English word (meaning: a ratchet or slight delay).\n   - Fits all feedback:\n     - ""crane"": C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x) → consistent.\n     - ""scrap"": S(x), C(-), R(-), A(-), P(x) → consistent.\n\n<guess>ratch</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: scrap -> FEEDBACK: S(x) C(-) R(-) A(-) P(x)\nGuess 3: ratch -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) C(-) H(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
  - C is in the word, but not in position 1.
  - R is in the word, but not in position 2.
  - A is in the word, but not in position 3.
  - N is not in the word.
  - E is not in the word.

Guess 2: ""scrap"" -> S(x), C(-), R(-), A(-), P(x)
Meaning:
  - S is not in the word.
  - C is in the word, but not in position 2.
  - R is in the word, but not in position 3.
  - A is in the word, but not in position 4.
  - P is not in the word.

Guess 3: ""ratch"" -> R(-), A(✓), T(x), C(-), H(x)
Meaning:
  - R is in the word, but not in position 1.
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  - T is not in the word.
  - C is in the word, but not in position 4.
  - H is not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Letters in the word: C, R, A (from multiple confirmations).
2. Letters not in the word: N, E, S, P, T, H (from the x's in all guesses).
3. Positional information:
   - A is in position 2 (from guess3: A(✓) at position 2).
   - R is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (from guess1: not 2; guess2: not 3; guess3: not 1). So R must be in position 4 or 5.
   - C is not in position 1, 2, or 4 (from guess1: not 1; guess2: not 2; guess3: not 4). So C must be in position 3 or 5.

But note: we have only 5 positions. And we know A is fixed at position 2.

So the word has:
  Position 1: ? (must be a letter we don't know, and not in the excluded list)
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: ? (could be C? or another letter? but C can be at 3 or 5)
  Position 4: ? (could be R? because R can be at 4 or 5)
  Position 5: ? (could be R or C, but not both because they are distinct? or could there be duplicates? We haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so assume no duplicates for now.)

But we have three letters: C, R, A. And A is at position 2. So we need to place C and R in two of the remaining positions: 1,3,4,5? But wait, position 1 is not occupied by a known letter, so it must be a new letter.

Actually, the word has 5 letters. We know A at 2, and we know C and R are present. So the other two letters must be new (not in the excluded list and not C,R,A).

So the word has:
  - A at position 2.
  - C must be in position 3 or 5 (since not 1,2,4).
  - R must be in position 4 or 5 (since not 1,2,3).

But position 5 can only hold one letter. So if C is at 5, then R must be at 4. If R is at 5, then C must be at 3. So two cases:

Case 1: C at 3, R at 4.
  Then positions 1 and 5 are new letters.

Case 2: C at 5, R at 4.
  Then positions 1 and 3 are new letters.

But wait: in case 2, if R is at 4 and C at 5, then we have:
  Position 1: new letter
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: new letter
  Position 4: R
  Position 5: C

In case 1:
  Position 1: new letter
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: C
  Position 4: R
  Position 5: new letter

Now, we also have the feedback from guess3: in ""ratch"", we had R at1 (which got -), A at2 (✓), T at3 (x), C at4 (-), H at5 (x). Since T and H are not in the word, we avoid them.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses letters not excluded.

Excluded letters: N, E, S, P, T, H.

We can use: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we are looking for common letters.

Let's consider case 1: pattern _ A C R _
We need to fill position1 and position5.

Possible words:
  - ""BACRO"" -> not a word.
  - ""DACRY"" -> not common? ""dacry"" is not a standard word.
  - ""FACTO"" -> but T is excluded? T is excluded, so no.
  - ""LACRO"" -> not a word? ""macro"" has M, but M is allowed? But ""macro"" is M A C R O -> that would be M at1, A at2, C at3, R at4, O at5. So ""macro"" fits the pattern? But we have to check if it violates any constraint.

Check ""macro"":
  - Position1: M (new, not excluded)
  - Position2: A (correct, fixed)
  - Position3: C -> but we have C at3? And our constraint: C must be at3? Yes, that's allowed (since C can be at3 or5, and here at3).
  - Position4: R -> and R must be at4? Yes, that's allowed (R can be at4 or5, and here at4).
  - Position5: O (new, not excluded)

Now, check against feedback:

Guess1: ""crane"" -> 
  C: in ""macro"" is at3, but in ""crane"" was at1 -> so (-) for C at1: correct (present but not at1).
  R: in ""macro"" at4, in ""crane"" at2 -> (-) for R at2: correct.
  A: in ""macro"" at2, in ""crane"" at3 -> (-) for A at3: correct (because A is at2, not at3).
  N: not in ""macro"": (x) correct.
  E: not in ""macro"": (x) correct.

Guess2: ""scrap"" ->
  S: not in ""macro"": (x) correct.
  C: in ""macro"" at3, in ""scrap"" at2 -> (-) for C at2: correct.
  R: in ""macro"" at4, in ""scrap"" at3 -> (-) for R at3: correct.
  A: in ""macro"" at2, in ""scrap"" at4 -> (-) for A at4: correct (because A is at2, not at4).
  P: not in ""macro"": (x) correct.

Guess3: ""ratch"" ->
  R: in ""macro"" at4, in ""ratch"" at1 -> (-) for R at1: correct.
  A: at2: (✓) correct.
  T: not in ""macro"": (x) correct.
  C: in ""macro"" at3, in ""ratch"" at4 -> (-) for C at4: correct (because C is at3, not at4).
  H: not in ""macro"": (x) correct.

So ""macro"" fits all feedback.

But is it the only possibility? We have case 2 as well.

Case 2: pattern _ A _ R C
We need to fill position1 and position3.

Possible words: 
  - ""BA R R C"" -> duplicate R? Not allowed? ""baric"" is not a word? 
  - ""DA R I C"" -> ""daric"" is a word? (an ancient coin) -> D A R I C.

Check ""daric"":
  - Position1: D
  - Position2: A
  - Position3: I
  - Position4: R
  - Position5: C

Check constraints:
  - A at2: fixed, correct.
  - R at4: allowed (since R can be at4 or5).
  - C at5: allowed (since C can be at3 or5? but here at5, which is allowed).

Now, check feedback:

Guess1: ""crane"" -> 
  C: in ""daric"" at5, in ""crane"" at1 -> (-) correct.
  R: in ""daric"" at4, in ""crane"" at2 -> (-) correct.
  A: in ""daric"" at2, in ""crane"" at3 -> (-) correct.
  N, E: absent -> (x) correct.

Guess2: ""scrap"" ->
  S: absent -> (x) correct.
  C: in ""daric"" at5, in ""scrap"" at2 -> (-) correct.
  R: in ""daric"" at4, in ""scrap"" at3 -> (-) correct.
  A: in ""daric"" at2, in ""scrap"" at4 -> (-) correct.
  P: absent -> (x) correct.

Guess3: ""ratch"" ->
  R: in ""daric"" at4, in ""ratch"" at1 -> (-) correct.
  A: at2: (✓) correct.
  T: absent -> (x) correct.
  C: in ""daric"" at5, in ""ratch"" at4 -> (-) correct (because C is at5, not at4).
  H: absent -> (x) correct.

So ""daric"" also fits.

We have at least two possibilities: ""macro"" and ""daric"".

But we need to choose one to guess. We can choose ""macro"" because it's more common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common letters? But we are in the fourth guess, so we might want to solve it.

But note: we have two candidates. We can choose one and see.

But let's see if there are more.

Other words for case1: _ A C R _
  - ""macro"" (M A C R O)
  - ""tacrl"" not a word? 
  - ""lacr?"" -> ""lacro"" not a word? 
  - ""wacr?"" -> not found.

Other words for case2: _ A _ R C
  - ""daric"" (D A R I C) -> valid
  - ""baric"" (B A R I C) -> not a common word? ""baric"" is an adjective relating to weight? But it's valid.
  - ""fario"" not? 
  - ""laric"" (L A R I C) -> ""laric"" is not a word? But ""larid"" is not? 
  - ""maric"" (M A R I C) -> not a word? 
  - ""oaric"" not? 
  - ""varic"" (V A R I C) -> relating to a vein? valid.

So we have:
  Case1: ""macro""
  Case2: ""daric"", ""baric"", ""varic"", etc.

But we don't know which one. We need to guess one.

To maximize information, we might choose a word that can distinguish between the cases? But we have two different patterns.

Alternatively, we can choose ""macro"" because it uses common letters and might be more likely.

But note: in ""macro"", we are using M and O, which are common. In ""daric"", we are using D and I.

We can also consider that we have not used many vowels. We have A, but what about O, I, U? 

But we have to pick one.

I'll go with ""macro"" because it's a very common word.

So the guess is ""macro"".

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""daric"" or ""macro"".

If we guess ""macro"" and the secret is ""daric"", the feedback would be:
  M: not in ""daric"" -> x
  A: at2: ✓
  C: in ""daric"" but at5? in ""macro"" at3 -> so for C: present but not at3 -> (-)
  R: in ""daric"" at4, in ""macro"" at4 -> ✓
  O: not in ""daric"" -> x

So feedback: M(x) A(✓) C(-) R(✓) O(x)

But if the secret is ""macro"", then we get all correct? No, because we are guessing ""macro"", so if it's the secret, we get all ✓.

But we don't know which one it is.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that fits one of the patterns and tests the other.

But we are limited by the constraints.

Another idea: we can guess a word that has the pattern of case2 but with letters that might rule out other options? But we are in the fourth guess, and we have only 6 tries.

I think it's safe to guess ""macro"".

So I'll go with that.
</think>
### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Letters in the word**: C, R, A (confirmed present from all guesses).
- **Letters NOT in the word**: N, E, S, P, T, H (excluded based on ""x"" feedback).
- **Positional constraints**:
  - **A** is fixed at **position 2** (from Guess 3: A(✓)).
  - **R** cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be in **position 4 or 5**.
  - **C** cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 → must be in **position 3 or 5**.
- **Pattern possibilities**:
  - **Case 1**: C at position 3, R at position 4 → pattern: `_ A C R _`.
  - **Case 2**: C at position 5, R at position 4 → pattern: `_ A _ R C`.

### Reasoning for the Guess:
- After testing possible words that fit the constraints and excluded letters, two candidates emerged:
  - **Case 1**: ""MACRO"" (M A C R O).
  - **Case 2**: ""DARIC"" (D A R I C) or similar (e.g., ""BARIC"", ""VARIC"").
- ""MACRO"" was chosen because:
  - It fits **Case 1** (`_ A C R _`), satisfying all constraints:
    - C at position 3 (allowed).
    - R at position 4 (allowed).
    - A at position 2 (fixed).
  - It uses common letters (M, O) not yet tested.
  - It is a high-frequency English word, increasing the likelihood of being correct.
- If ""MACRO"" is incorrect, the feedback will help distinguish between Case 1 and Case 2 (e.g., if ""MACRO"" gets C(-) or R(-), it supports Case 2).

### Guess:
<guess>macro</guess>",macro,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(-), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning:
  - C is in the word, but not in position 1.
  - R is in the word, but not in position 2.
  - A is in the word, but not in position 3.
  - N is not in the word.
  - E is not in the word.

Guess 2: ""scrap"" -> S(x), C(-), R(-), A(-), P(x)
Meaning:
  - S is not in the word.
  - C is in the word, but not in position 2.
  - R is in the word, but not in position 3.
  - A is in the word, but not in position 4.
  - P is not in the word.

Guess 3: ""ratch"" -> R(-), A(✓), T(x), C(-), H(x)
Meaning:
  - R is in the word, but not in position 1.
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  - T is not in the word.
  - C is in the word, but not in position 4.
  - H is not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. Letters in the word: C, R, A (from multiple confirmations).
2. Letters not in the word: N, E, S, P, T, H (from the x's in all guesses).
3. Positional information:
   - A is in position 2 (from guess3: A(✓) at position 2).
   - R is not in position 1, 2, or 3 (from guess1: not 2; guess2: not 3; guess3: not 1). So R must be in position 4 or 5.
   - C is not in position 1, 2, or 4 (from guess1: not 1; guess2: not 2; guess3: not 4). So C must be in position 3 or 5.

But note: we have only 5 positions. And we know A is fixed at position 2.

So the word has:
  Position 1: ? (must be a letter we don't know, and not in the excluded list)
  Position 2: A (fixed)
  Position 3: ? (could be C? or another letter? but C can be at 3 or 5)
  Position 4: ? (could be R? because R can be at 4 or 5)
  Position 5: ? (could be R or C, but not both because they are distinct? or could there be duplicates? We haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so assume no duplicates for now.)

But we have three letters: C, R, A. And A is at position 2. So we need to place C and R in two of the remaining positions: 1,3,4,5? But wait, position 1 is not occupied by a known letter, so it must be a new letter.

Actually, the word has 5 letters. We know A at 2, and we know C and R are present. So the other two letters must be new (not in the excluded list and not C,R,A).

So the word has:
  - A at position 2.
  - C must be in position 3 or 5 (since not 1,2,4).
  - R must be in position 4 or 5 (since not 1,2,3).

But position 5 can only hold one letter. So if C is at 5, then R must be at 4. If R is at 5, then C must be at 3. So two cases:

Case 1: C at 3, R at 4.
  Then positions 1 and 5 are new letters.

Case 2: C at 5, R at 4.
  Then positions 1 and 3 are new letters.

But wait: in case 2, if R is at 4 and C at 5, then we have:
  Position 1: new letter
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: new letter
  Position 4: R
  Position 5: C

In case 1:
  Position 1: new letter
  Position 2: A
  Position 3: C
  Position 4: R
  Position 5: new letter

Now, we also have the feedback from guess3: in ""ratch"", we had R at1 (which got -), A at2 (✓), T at3 (x), C at4 (-), H at5 (x). Since T and H are not in the word, we avoid them.

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses letters not excluded.

Excluded letters: N, E, S, P, T, H.

We can use: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we are looking for common letters.

Let's consider case 1: pattern _ A C R _
We need to fill position1 and position5.

Possible words:
  - ""BACRO"" -> not a word.
  - ""DACRY"" -> not common? ""dacry"" is not a standard word.
  - ""FACTO"" -> but T is excluded? T is excluded, so no.
  - ""LACRO"" -> not a word? ""macro"" has M, but M is allowed? But ""macro"" is M A C R O -> that would be M at1, A at2, C at3, R at4, O at5. So ""macro"" fits the pattern? But we have to check if it violates any constraint.

Check ""macro"":
  - Position1: M (new, not excluded)
  - Position2: A (correct, fixed)
  - Position3: C -> but we have C at3? And our constraint: C must be at3? Yes, that's allowed (since C can be at3 or5, and here at3).
  - Position4: R -> and R must be at4? Yes, that's allowed (R can be at4 or5, and here at4).
  - Position5: O (new, not excluded)

Now, check against feedback:

Guess1: ""crane"" -> 
  C: in ""macro"" is at3, but in ""crane"" was at1 -> so (-) for C at1: correct (present but not at1).
  R: in ""macro"" at4, in ""crane"" at2 -> (-) for R at2: correct.
  A: in ""macro"" at2, in ""crane"" at3 -> (-) for A at3: correct (because A is at2, not at3).
  N: not in ""macro"": (x) correct.
  E: not in ""macro"": (x) correct.

Guess2: ""scrap"" ->
  S: not in ""macro"": (x) correct.
  C: in ""macro"" at3, in ""scrap"" at2 -> (-) for C at2: correct.
  R: in ""macro"" at4, in ""scrap"" at3 -> (-) for R at3: correct.
  A: in ""macro"" at2, in ""scrap"" at4 -> (-) for A at4: correct (because A is at2, not at4).
  P: not in ""macro"": (x) correct.

Guess3: ""ratch"" ->
  R: in ""macro"" at4, in ""ratch"" at1 -> (-) for R at1: correct.
  A: at2: (✓) correct.
  T: not in ""macro"": (x) correct.
  C: in ""macro"" at3, in ""ratch"" at4 -> (-) for C at4: correct (because C is at3, not at4).
  H: not in ""macro"": (x) correct.

So ""macro"" fits all feedback.

But is it the only possibility? We have case 2 as well.

Case 2: pattern _ A _ R C
We need to fill position1 and position3.

Possible words: 
  - ""BA R R C"" -> duplicate R? Not allowed? ""baric"" is not a word? 
  - ""DA R I C"" -> ""daric"" is a word? (an ancient coin) -> D A R I C.

Check ""daric"":
  - Position1: D
  - Position2: A
  - Position3: I
  - Position4: R
  - Position5: C

Check constraints:
  - A at2: fixed, correct.
  - R at4: allowed (since R can be at4 or5).
  - C at5: allowed (since C can be at3 or5? but here at5, which is allowed).

Now, check feedback:

Guess1: ""crane"" -> 
  C: in ""daric"" at5, in ""crane"" at1 -> (-) correct.
  R: in ""daric"" at4, in ""crane"" at2 -> (-) correct.
  A: in ""daric"" at2, in ""crane"" at3 -> (-) correct.
  N, E: absent -> (x) correct.

Guess2: ""scrap"" ->
  S: absent -> (x) correct.
  C: in ""daric"" at5, in ""scrap"" at2 -> (-) correct.
  R: in ""daric"" at4, in ""scrap"" at3 -> (-) correct.
  A: in ""daric"" at2, in ""scrap"" at4 -> (-) correct.
  P: absent -> (x) correct.

Guess3: ""ratch"" ->
  R: in ""daric"" at4, in ""ratch"" at1 -> (-) correct.
  A: at2: (✓) correct.
  T: absent -> (x) correct.
  C: in ""daric"" at5, in ""ratch"" at4 -> (-) correct (because C is at5, not at4).
  H: absent -> (x) correct.

So ""daric"" also fits.

We have at least two possibilities: ""macro"" and ""daric"".

But we need to choose one to guess. We can choose ""macro"" because it's more common.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests more common letters? But we are in the fourth guess, so we might want to solve it.

But note: we have two candidates. We can choose one and see.

But let's see if there are more.

Other words for case1: _ A C R _
  - ""macro"" (M A C R O)
  - ""tacrl"" not a word? 
  - ""lacr?"" -> ""lacro"" not a word? 
  - ""wacr?"" -> not found.

Other words for case2: _ A _ R C
  - ""daric"" (D A R I C) -> valid
  - ""baric"" (B A R I C) -> not a common word? ""baric"" is an adjective relating to weight? But it's valid.
  - ""fario"" not? 
  - ""laric"" (L A R I C) -> ""laric"" is not a word? But ""larid"" is not? 
  - ""maric"" (M A R I C) -> not a word? 
  - ""oaric"" not? 
  - ""varic"" (V A R I C) -> relating to a vein? valid.

So we have:
  Case1: ""macro""
  Case2: ""daric"", ""baric"", ""varic"", etc.

But we don't know which one. We need to guess one.

To maximize information, we might choose a word that can distinguish between the cases? But we have two different patterns.

Alternatively, we can choose ""macro"" because it uses common letters and might be more likely.

But note: in ""macro"", we are using M and O, which are common. In ""daric"", we are using D and I.

We can also consider that we have not used many vowels. We have A, but what about O, I, U? 

But we have to pick one.

I'll go with ""macro"" because it's a very common word.

So the guess is ""macro"".

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""daric"" or ""macro"".

If we guess ""macro"" and the secret is ""daric"", the feedback would be:
  M: not in ""daric"" -> x
  A: at2: ✓
  C: in ""daric"" but at5? in ""macro"" at3 -> so for C: present but not at3 -> (-)
  R: in ""daric"" at4, in ""macro"" at4 -> ✓
  O: not in ""daric"" -> x

So feedback: M(x) A(✓) C(-) R(✓) O(x)

But if the secret is ""macro"", then we get all correct? No, because we are guessing ""macro"", so if it's the secret, we get all ✓.

But we don't know which one it is.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that fits one of the patterns and tests the other.

But we are limited by the constraints.

Another idea: we can guess a word that has the pattern of case2 but with letters that might rule out other options? But we are in the fourth guess, and we have only 6 tries.

I think it's safe to guess ""macro"".

So I'll go with that.### Analysis of Feedback:
- **Letters in the word**: C, R, A (confirmed present from all guesses).
- **Letters NOT in the word**: N, E, S, P, T, H (excluded based on ""x"" feedback).
- **Positional constraints**:
  - **A** is fixed at **position 2** (from Guess 3: A(✓)).
  - **R** cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 → must be in **position 4 or 5**.
  - **C** cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4 → must be in **position 3 or 5**.
- **Pattern possibilities**:
  - **Case 1**: C at position 3, R at position 4 → pattern: `_ A C R _`.
  - **Case 2**: C at position 5, R at position 4 → pattern: `_ A _ R C`.

### Reasoning for the Guess:
- After testing possible words that fit the constraints and excluded letters, two candidates emerged:
  - **Case 1**: ""MACRO"" (M A C R O).
  - **Case 2**: ""DARIC"" (D A R I C) or similar (e.g., ""BARIC"", ""VARIC"").
- ""MACRO"" was chosen because:
  - It fits **Case 1** (`_ A C R _`), satisfying all constraints:
    - C at position 3 (allowed).
    - R at position 4 (allowed).
    - A at position 2 (fixed).
  - It uses common letters (M, O) not yet tested.
  - It is a high-frequency English word, increasing the likelihood of being correct.
- If ""MACRO"" is incorrect, the feedback will help distinguish between Case 1 and Case 2 (e.g., if ""MACRO"" gets C(-) or R(-), it supports Case 2).

### Guess:",Guess 4: macro -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) C(✓) R(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
