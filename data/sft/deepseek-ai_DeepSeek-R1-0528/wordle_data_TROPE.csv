We are playing Wordle. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter secret word.
 Since it's the first guess, we have no prior feedback. We want to choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 A common strategy is to use a word with common letters and no repeating letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.

 Let's think about the most common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.
 We should pick a word that includes several of these.

 Some good starting words are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has the letters C, R, A, N, E. They are reasonably common and distinct.

 So my first guess will be: CRANE
</think>
I'm starting with the word ""CRANE"" because it contains common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N), which provide good coverage of frequently used letters in English. This maximizes the chance of getting valuable feedback about the secret word's letters and positions. Since this is the first guess, there's no prior feedback to incorporate.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has R as the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has E as the fifth letter)

So we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
1. Has R as the second letter and E as the fifth letter.
2. Avoids the letters C, A, and N (since they are not in the word).
3. Includes other common letters to test for their presence.

Common letters we haven't tested yet: S, T, I, O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to use a word that has S, T, or other common consonants and vowels in the first, third, and fourth positions.

Possible words: 
- We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ R _ _ E.

Let's think of words that fit: 
- TRADE (but A is not in the word, so avoid A)
- PRICE (but C is not in the word, so avoid C)
- BRIDE (B, R, I, D, E) -> pattern: B R I D E

Check the letters: 
- B: not tested yet
- I: not tested
- D: not tested

Also, we avoid C, A, N.

So ""BRIDE"" is a candidate.

Another option: ""GRIME"" (G, R, I, M, E) -> G R I M E

But we don't know about G, I, M.

Another: ""WRITE"" (W, R, I, T, E) -> W R I T E

We could also consider ""TRIPE"" (T, R, I, P, E) -> T R I P E

But note that we have E at the end and R in the second position.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. Since we have two positions to figure out (first, third, fourth) but we have three positions to fill (first, third, fourth) and we can test multiple letters.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid C, A, N:
- BRINE (but N is not in the word, so avoid) -> invalid
- TRICE (C is not allowed) -> invalid
- PRUNE (P, R, U, N, E) -> N is not allowed -> invalid
- BRUTE (B, R, U, T, E) -> avoids C, A, N. Letters: B, U, T are new.
- GRIPE (G, R, I, P, E) -> G, I, P new.
- WRITE (W, R, I, T, E) -> W, I, T new.

Among these, ""BRUTE"", ""GRIPE"", ""WRITE"" are valid.

We might also consider ""PRIDE"" (P, R, I, D, E) -> P, I, D new.

But note: we have two positions to test: first, third, and fourth. Actually, we have three positions: 1, 3, 4.

We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback. So we should choose a word with common letters that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but avoid C, A, N).

Common letters: S, T, I, O, L, etc.

We can try to include S, T, or I.

But note: we have to have R in second and E in fifth.

A word like ""TRITE"" (T, R, I, T, E) -> but it has duplicate T, which might not be efficient because if T is in the word, we might not know which position.

Better to have all distinct letters where possible.

So ""BRUTE"": B, R, U, T, E -> distinct: B, U, T are new.
""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E -> distinct: P, I, D.
""GRIPE"": G, R, I, P, E -> distinct: G, I, P.
""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> distinct: W, I, T.

We also have to consider that the word must be valid.

Another candidate: ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) -> D, I, V.

But V is less common.

I think ""BRUTE"" is a good choice because it tests B, U, T.

Alternatively, ""TRIPE"" (T, R, I, P, E) -> T, I, P.

But let's see the frequency of letters.

We know the secret word has R and E, and doesn't have C, A, N.

We need to test for the presence of other vowels? We have U in ""BRUTE"", I in ""PRIDE"", etc.

Since we have only one vowel slot (positions 1,3,4) but actually we can have multiple vowels.

We should test a vowel in the third or fourth position.

In ""BRUTE"", we have U in the third and T in the fourth.

In ""PRIDE"", we have I in the third and D in the fourth.

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we have E at the end, so the word might have another vowel in the middle.

I'll go with ""BRUTE"" because it tests three common consonants: B, U, T.

So my second guess: BRUTE

But let me confirm: 
- First letter: B
- Second: R (fixed)
- Third: U
- Fourth: T
- Fifth: E (fixed)

And we avoid C, A, N.

So, <guess>BRUTE</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the correct position (second letter, marked ""✓"").
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter, marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ R _ _ E`, and it **excludes** C, A, and N.

For the second guess:
- The word must have R as the second letter and E as the fifth letter.
- It should avoid using C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with common untested letters (B, U, T) in the other positions to probe for presence/position.

""BRUTE"" fits this perfectly:
- B (new letter) in position 1.
- U (new vowel) in position 3.
- T (common consonant) in position 4.
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of useful feedback.

<guess>BRUTE</guess>",BRUTE,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we have E at the end, so the word might have another vowel in the middle.

I'll go with ""BRUTE"" because it tests three common consonants: B, U, T.

So my second guess: BRUTE

But let me confirm: 
- First letter: B
- Second: R (fixed)
- Third: U
- Fourth: T
- Fifth: E (fixed)

And we avoid C, A, N.

So, <guess>BRUTE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the correct position (second letter, marked ""✓"").
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter, marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ R _ _ E`, and it **excludes** C, A, and N.

For the second guess:
- The word must have R as the second letter and E as the fifth letter.
- It should avoid using C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with common untested letters (B, U, T) in the other positions to probe for presence/position.

""BRUTE"" fits this perfectly:
- B (new letter) in position 1.
- U (new vowel) in position 3.
- T (common consonant) in position 4.
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of useful feedback.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. CRANE: 
   - C: not in word (x)
   - R: correct position (second letter) (✓)
   - A: not in word (x)
   - N: not in word (x)
   - E: correct position (fifth letter) (✓)

2. BRUTE:
   - B: not in word (x)
   - R: correct position (second letter) (✓)
   - U: not in word (x)
   - T: in word but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not in the fourth position) (-)
   - E: correct position (fifth letter) (✓)

So, from the feedback, we know:

- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E
- The letter T is in the word, but not in the fourth position.
- We have eliminated the letters: C, A, N, B, U (since they are marked as not in the word).
- The letters R and E are confirmed and in the correct positions (second and fifth).

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: [not C,A,N,B,U] R [not C,A,N,B,U and not T?] [not C,A,N,B,U] E

But note: T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. So T must be in either the first or the third position? Actually, the positions are 1, 3, and 4. But we know T is not in position 4, so T must be in position 1 or 3.

Also, we have to consider that the word has exactly 5 letters and we know two of them (R and E). We know T is present, so it must be in position 1 or 3.

We have eliminated: A, B, C, N, U.

We have confirmed: R, E, T (present, but position unknown except not 4).

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that:
- Fits the pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Includes T in either position 1 or 3 (to test where T is, and also to get more information about other letters)
- Avoids the eliminated letters: A, B, C, N, U.
- Uses new common letters to test for the remaining positions.

The remaining positions are 1, 3, and 4. We know T is in the word but not in 4, so T must be in 1 or 3.

We can try to use a word that puts T in position 1 and then new letters in 3 and 4, or T in position 3 and new letters in 1 and 4.

But note: we also need to consider that the word must be valid.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and include T.

Option 1: T in position 1 -> T R _ _ E
Option 2: T in position 3 -> _ R T _ E

We should also try to cover more common letters that we haven't tested. We haven't tested: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: S, T (we know it's in), O, I, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to include S, O, I, L, etc.

Let me list some candidate words:

For Option 1 (T in position 1):
- TRADE (but A is eliminated) -> invalid
- TRIPE (P and I, but we haven't tested) -> T R I P E -> but we have to avoid A, B, C, N, U -> I and P are new. However, we don't know if I or P are in the word.
- TRICE (C is eliminated) -> invalid
- TRIKE (K and E, but E is already at end) -> T R I K E -> K is new.
- TRIPE and TRIKE are possibilities.

But note: we have E at the end, so in TRIKE, the E is at the end which is correct, but we are testing T in first.

For Option 2 (T in position 3):
- We need a word: _ R T _ E
- Examples: WRITE (W, R, I, T, E) -> but W and I are new. However, we have eliminated B, but W is not eliminated. Also, we have U eliminated, but W is okay.
- But note: in WRITE, the T is in the fourth position? Wait, positions: 1:W, 2:R, 3:I, 4:T, 5:E -> so T is in position 4? But we know from feedback that T is not in position 4 (from BRUTE feedback: T is in the word but not in position 4). So WRITE has T in position 4, which is not allowed because we know T is not in position 4.

Therefore, we cannot have T in position 4. So for Option 2, we put T in position 3, then the word is: _ R T _ E, so the fourth position must be a different letter.

Examples:
- ARTIC (but A is eliminated) -> invalid
- ORTET (not a common word, and T repeated) -> not good
- We need common words: 
  - PRICE (C eliminated) -> invalid
  - GRIME: G R I M E -> but no T? We need T in the word. We are putting T in position 3? GRIME has no T. 
  - We need a word with T in position 3: so the pattern is _ R T _ E.

Let me think: 
- WRITE is invalid because T is in position 4.
- What about ""RITZE""? Not common.
- ""FRITZ"" but no E at the end.

Actually, the word must end with E. So we need: _ R T _ E.

Possible words: 
- ARTIC is not and A is out.
- ORTET? Not a word.
- I found: ""WROTE"" -> W R O T E -> but T is in position 4? Positions: 1:W, 2:R, 3:O, 4:T, 5:E -> again T in position 4, which is not allowed.

So it's hard to find a word with T in position 3 and ending with E? Because the fourth letter must be something else.

Another idea: ""GRATE"" -> but A is eliminated.

""TRITE"" -> T R I T E -> but T is repeated? And T in position 1 and 4? But we know T is not in position 4, so TRITE has T in 1 and 4, but position 4 is invalid.

We must avoid position 4 for T.

So let's list words that have T in position 1 or 3 and avoid the eliminated letters.

Position 1: T R _ _ E
- TRIPE: T R I P E -> I and P are new, and avoids A,B,C,N,U.
- TRIKE: T R I K E -> I and K are new.
- TRIPE seems better because P is more common than K.

Position 3: _ R T _ E
- We need a word with T in the third position and the fourth position is not T and not an eliminated letter.
- Example: ""DRIVE"" -> D R I V E -> no T.
- ""PRATE"" -> A eliminated.
- ""WRITE"" -> T in position 4, not 3.
- ""FRETE""? Not common.
- ""CRWTH""? Not 5 letters and no E.

It seems difficult. Maybe ""ORTET"" is not a word. Let me think of common words.

Another: ""PARTE"" -> A eliminated.

Perhaps ""DIRTY"" -> but doesn't end with E.

So maybe it's easier to go with T in position 1.

We can also consider that T might be in position 1, and then we test two new letters in 3 and 4.

But note: we have to avoid using eliminated letters.

So let's go with TRIPE: T R I P E

But wait, in TRIPE, the E is at the end, which is correct, and R is in the second, which is correct. We are testing T in position 1, I in position 3, P in position 4.

If we get feedback that T is correct in position 1, then we know T is in the first position. If not, then T must be in position 3 (since it's in the word and not in 4, and we are testing position 1).

But if we use TRIPE and T is actually in position 3, then in TRIPE, T is in position 1 which is wrong, so we might get T marked as present but wrong position? But we know T is in the word, so if it's not in position 1, it would be marked as (-) for T.

But we are also testing I and P.

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have T in position 1 or 4, but has T in position 3? But we don't have a good word for that.

Another candidate: ""STORE"" -> S T O R E -> but R is in position 4? Pattern: S T O R E -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need R in position 2, not 4. So that doesn't fit the pattern.

We must have R in position 2 and E in position 5.

So back to TRIPE.

We can also consider ""TRICE"" but C is eliminated.

""TRIBE"" but B is eliminated.

So TRIPE seems a good candidate.

Another option: ""TRADE"" is out because of A.

""TROPE"" -> T R O P E -> O and P are new. This is also a valid word.

So we have two options: TRIPE (I and P) or TROPE (O and P).

Which one to choose? We want to test more common letters.

I is more common than O? In English, E, T, A, O, I, N, ... so O is more common than I? Actually, O is more common than I.

But we have already eliminated A and N, so O and I are both good.

But we can also consider that we might get more information.

Another idea: we know T is in the word, so if we put T in position 1 and it is correct, then we get a lot of information. If it's not, then we know T must be in position 3.

So let's choose TRIPE.

But note: in TRIPE, we are using I and P. We haven't tested S, O, L, D, etc.

We could choose a word that includes S, which is very common.

For example, ""TRESE"" is not a word.

""TRUSS"" doesn't end with E.

""PRISE"" -> P R I S E -> but we don't have T? We need to include T because we want to test its position.

We must include T in the guess because we know it's in the word and we need to find its position.

So the guess must include T.

Therefore, for the pattern _ R _ _ E, we can have T in 1 or 3.

Since we don't have a good word with T in 3, we go with T in 1.

So I choose TRIPE.

But let me check if there is a word with T in position 3: 

- ""ORTET"" is not valid.
- ""IRATE"" -> A eliminated.
- ""URATE"" -> U eliminated.
- ""CRATE"" -> C eliminated.

So no, so TRIPE or TROPE.

I think TRIPE is fine.

But we have to avoid U, and TRIPE doesn't have U.

So I'll go with TRIPE.

But wait, in the feedback for BRUTE, T was marked as present but not in position 4. In TRIPE, we are putting T in position 1 and P in position 4. If T is actually in position 3, then in TRIPE, T in position 1 would be marked as present but wrong position, and we would know that T is not in 1, so it must be in 3.

Then we can use that in the next guess.

Similarly, we get information about I and P.

So let's do that.

Third guess: TRIPE

But note: the word is TRIPE: T, R, I, P, E.

We know R and E are fixed and correct, so we are really testing T, I, P.

Now, we must output the guess.

So <guess>TRIPE</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: `C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)`  
  - **R** is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).  
  - **E** is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).  
  - **C, A, N** are not in the secret word.  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ R _ _ E`.  

- **Guess 2: BRUTE** → Feedback: `B(x) R(✓) U(x) T(-) E(✓)`  
  - **R** and **E** are confirmed in positions 2 and 5 (no change).  
  - **T** is in the secret word but **not in position 4**.  
  - **B** and **U** are not in the secret word.  
  - Updated secret word pattern: `_ R _ _ E`, with **T** present but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1 or 3).  
  - Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, B, U** (cannot be in the secret word).  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
1. The secret word must match the pattern `_ R _ _ E`.  
2. **T** must be included in the guess, but **not in position 4** (since feedback confirmed it is in the word but misplaced there).  
3. Avoid eliminated letters: **C, A, N, B, U**.  
4. Test new common letters to gather more information (e.g., **S, I, O, P, D, L, M**).  
5. Prioritize words with distinct unused letters to maximize feedback.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test the position of T**: Since **T** must be in position 1 or 3, we can use a word that places **T** in position 1 (e.g., `T R _ _ E`). This helps:  
  - If **T** is correct in position 1, we lock in the first letter.  
  - If **T** is marked as misplaced (`-`), it must be in position 3.  
- **Probe new common letters**: Use untested letters like **I** and **P** (high-frequency consonants) in positions 3 and 4 to check for presence/position.  
- **Avoid redundancy**: Skip words with eliminated letters or repeated letters.  

### Why ""TRIPE""?
- **Fits the pattern**: `T R I P E` → Tests **T** in position 1, **I** in position 3, **P** in position 4.  
- **Tests key letters**:  
  - **T** (known to be in the word, position to be determined).  
  - **I** (common vowel, untested).  
  - **P** (common consonant, untested).  
- **Avoids eliminated letters**: No **C, A, N, B, U**.  
- **Distinct letters**: All 5 letters are unique, maximizing information potential.  
- **Expected feedback**:  
  - If **T** is in position 1, it will show `✓`; if not, it will show `-` (confirming **T** is in position 3).  
  - **I** and **P** will reveal if they are present and in the right positions.  

<guess>TRIPE</guess>",TRIPE,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. CRANE: 
   - C: not in word (x)
   - R: correct position (second letter) (✓)
   - A: not in word (x)
   - N: not in word (x)
   - E: correct position (fifth letter) (✓)

2. BRUTE:
   - B: not in word (x)
   - R: correct position (second letter) (✓)
   - U: not in word (x)
   - T: in word but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not in the fourth position) (-)
   - E: correct position (fifth letter) (✓)

So, from the feedback, we know:

- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E
- The letter T is in the word, but not in the fourth position.
- We have eliminated the letters: C, A, N, B, U (since they are marked as not in the word).
- The letters R and E are confirmed and in the correct positions (second and fifth).

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: [not C,A,N,B,U] R [not C,A,N,B,U and not T?] [not C,A,N,B,U] E

But note: T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. So T must be in either the first or the third position? Actually, the positions are 1, 3, and 4. But we know T is not in position 4, so T must be in position 1 or 3.

Also, we have to consider that the word has exactly 5 letters and we know two of them (R and E). We know T is present, so it must be in position 1 or 3.

We have eliminated: A, B, C, N, U.

We have confirmed: R, E, T (present, but position unknown except not 4).

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that:
- Fits the pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Includes T in either position 1 or 3 (to test where T is, and also to get more information about other letters)
- Avoids the eliminated letters: A, B, C, N, U.
- Uses new common letters to test for the remaining positions.

The remaining positions are 1, 3, and 4. We know T is in the word but not in 4, so T must be in 1 or 3.

We can try to use a word that puts T in position 1 and then new letters in 3 and 4, or T in position 3 and new letters in 1 and 4.

But note: we also need to consider that the word must be valid.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and include T.

Option 1: T in position 1 -> T R _ _ E
Option 2: T in position 3 -> _ R T _ E

We should also try to cover more common letters that we haven't tested. We haven't tested: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: S, T (we know it's in), O, I, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to include S, O, I, L, etc.

Let me list some candidate words:

For Option 1 (T in position 1):
- TRADE (but A is eliminated) -> invalid
- TRIPE (P and I, but we haven't tested) -> T R I P E -> but we have to avoid A, B, C, N, U -> I and P are new. However, we don't know if I or P are in the word.
- TRICE (C is eliminated) -> invalid
- TRIKE (K and E, but E is already at end) -> T R I K E -> K is new.
- TRIPE and TRIKE are possibilities.

But note: we have E at the end, so in TRIKE, the E is at the end which is correct, but we are testing T in first.

For Option 2 (T in position 3):
- We need a word: _ R T _ E
- Examples: WRITE (W, R, I, T, E) -> but W and I are new. However, we have eliminated B, but W is not eliminated. Also, we have U eliminated, but W is okay.
- But note: in WRITE, the T is in the fourth position? Wait, positions: 1:W, 2:R, 3:I, 4:T, 5:E -> so T is in position 4? But we know from feedback that T is not in position 4 (from BRUTE feedback: T is in the word but not in position 4). So WRITE has T in position 4, which is not allowed because we know T is not in position 4.

Therefore, we cannot have T in position 4. So for Option 2, we put T in position 3, then the word is: _ R T _ E, so the fourth position must be a different letter.

Examples:
- ARTIC (but A is eliminated) -> invalid
- ORTET (not a common word, and T repeated) -> not good
- We need common words: 
  - PRICE (C eliminated) -> invalid
  - GRIME: G R I M E -> but no T? We need T in the word. We are putting T in position 3? GRIME has no T. 
  - We need a word with T in position 3: so the pattern is _ R T _ E.

Let me think: 
- WRITE is invalid because T is in position 4.
- What about ""RITZE""? Not common.
- ""FRITZ"" but no E at the end.

Actually, the word must end with E. So we need: _ R T _ E.

Possible words: 
- ARTIC is not and A is out.
- ORTET? Not a word.
- I found: ""WROTE"" -> W R O T E -> but T is in position 4? Positions: 1:W, 2:R, 3:O, 4:T, 5:E -> again T in position 4, which is not allowed.

So it's hard to find a word with T in position 3 and ending with E? Because the fourth letter must be something else.

Another idea: ""GRATE"" -> but A is eliminated.

""TRITE"" -> T R I T E -> but T is repeated? And T in position 1 and 4? But we know T is not in position 4, so TRITE has T in 1 and 4, but position 4 is invalid.

We must avoid position 4 for T.

So let's list words that have T in position 1 or 3 and avoid the eliminated letters.

Position 1: T R _ _ E
- TRIPE: T R I P E -> I and P are new, and avoids A,B,C,N,U.
- TRIKE: T R I K E -> I and K are new.
- TRIPE seems better because P is more common than K.

Position 3: _ R T _ E
- We need a word with T in the third position and the fourth position is not T and not an eliminated letter.
- Example: ""DRIVE"" -> D R I V E -> no T.
- ""PRATE"" -> A eliminated.
- ""WRITE"" -> T in position 4, not 3.
- ""FRETE""? Not common.
- ""CRWTH""? Not 5 letters and no E.

It seems difficult. Maybe ""ORTET"" is not a word. Let me think of common words.

Another: ""PARTE"" -> A eliminated.

Perhaps ""DIRTY"" -> but doesn't end with E.

So maybe it's easier to go with T in position 1.

We can also consider that T might be in position 1, and then we test two new letters in 3 and 4.

But note: we have to avoid using eliminated letters.

So let's go with TRIPE: T R I P E

But wait, in TRIPE, the E is at the end, which is correct, and R is in the second, which is correct. We are testing T in position 1, I in position 3, P in position 4.

If we get feedback that T is correct in position 1, then we know T is in the first position. If not, then T must be in position 3 (since it's in the word and not in 4, and we are testing position 1).

But if we use TRIPE and T is actually in position 3, then in TRIPE, T is in position 1 which is wrong, so we might get T marked as present but wrong position? But we know T is in the word, so if it's not in position 1, it would be marked as (-) for T.

But we are also testing I and P.

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have T in position 1 or 4, but has T in position 3? But we don't have a good word for that.

Another candidate: ""STORE"" -> S T O R E -> but R is in position 4? Pattern: S T O R E -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need R in position 2, not 4. So that doesn't fit the pattern.

We must have R in position 2 and E in position 5.

So back to TRIPE.

We can also consider ""TRICE"" but C is eliminated.

""TRIBE"" but B is eliminated.

So TRIPE seems a good candidate.

Another option: ""TRADE"" is out because of A.

""TROPE"" -> T R O P E -> O and P are new. This is also a valid word.

So we have two options: TRIPE (I and P) or TROPE (O and P).

Which one to choose? We want to test more common letters.

I is more common than O? In English, E, T, A, O, I, N, ... so O is more common than I? Actually, O is more common than I.

But we have already eliminated A and N, so O and I are both good.

But we can also consider that we might get more information.

Another idea: we know T is in the word, so if we put T in position 1 and it is correct, then we get a lot of information. If it's not, then we know T must be in position 3.

So let's choose TRIPE.

But note: in TRIPE, we are using I and P. We haven't tested S, O, L, D, etc.

We could choose a word that includes S, which is very common.

For example, ""TRESE"" is not a word.

""TRUSS"" doesn't end with E.

""PRISE"" -> P R I S E -> but we don't have T? We need to include T because we want to test its position.

We must include T in the guess because we know it's in the word and we need to find its position.

So the guess must include T.

Therefore, for the pattern _ R _ _ E, we can have T in 1 or 3.

Since we don't have a good word with T in 3, we go with T in 1.

So I choose TRIPE.

But let me check if there is a word with T in position 3: 

- ""ORTET"" is not valid.
- ""IRATE"" -> A eliminated.
- ""URATE"" -> U eliminated.
- ""CRATE"" -> C eliminated.

So no, so TRIPE or TROPE.

I think TRIPE is fine.

But we have to avoid U, and TRIPE doesn't have U.

So I'll go with TRIPE.

But wait, in the feedback for BRUTE, T was marked as present but not in position 4. In TRIPE, we are putting T in position 1 and P in position 4. If T is actually in position 3, then in TRIPE, T in position 1 would be marked as present but wrong position, and we would know that T is not in 1, so it must be in 3.

Then we can use that in the next guess.

Similarly, we get information about I and P.

So let's do that.

Third guess: TRIPE

But note: the word is TRIPE: T, R, I, P, E.

We know R and E are fixed and correct, so we are really testing T, I, P.

Now, we must output the guess.

So <guess>TRIPE</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: `C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)`  
  - **R** is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).  
  - **E** is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).  
  - **C, A, N** are not in the secret word.  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ R _ _ E`.  

- **Guess 2: BRUTE** → Feedback: `B(x) R(✓) U(x) T(-) E(✓)`  
  - **R** and **E** are confirmed in positions 2 and 5 (no change).  
  - **T** is in the secret word but **not in position 4**.  
  - **B** and **U** are not in the secret word.  
  - Updated secret word pattern: `_ R _ _ E`, with **T** present but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1 or 3).  
  - Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, B, U** (cannot be in the secret word).  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
1. The secret word must match the pattern `_ R _ _ E`.  
2. **T** must be included in the guess, but **not in position 4** (since feedback confirmed it is in the word but misplaced there).  
3. Avoid eliminated letters: **C, A, N, B, U**.  
4. Test new common letters to gather more information (e.g., **S, I, O, P, D, L, M**).  
5. Prioritize words with distinct unused letters to maximize feedback.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test the position of T**: Since **T** must be in position 1 or 3, we can use a word that places **T** in position 1 (e.g., `T R _ _ E`). This helps:  
  - If **T** is correct in position 1, we lock in the first letter.  
  - If **T** is marked as misplaced (`-`), it must be in position 3.  
- **Probe new common letters**: Use untested letters like **I** and **P** (high-frequency consonants) in positions 3 and 4 to check for presence/position.  
- **Avoid redundancy**: Skip words with eliminated letters or repeated letters.  

### Why ""TRIPE""?
- **Fits the pattern**: `T R I P E` → Tests **T** in position 1, **I** in position 3, **P** in position 4.  
- **Tests key letters**:  
  - **T** (known to be in the word, position to be determined).  
  - **I** (common vowel, untested).  
  - **P** (common consonant, untested).  
- **Avoids eliminated letters**: No **C, A, N, B, U**.  
- **Distinct letters**: All 5 letters are unique, maximizing information potential.  
- **Expected feedback**:  
  - If **T** is in position 1, it will show `✓`; if not, it will show `-` (confirming **T** is in position 3).  
  - **I** and **P** will reveal if they are present and in the right positions.",Guess 3: TRIPE -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) R(✓) I(x) P(✓) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are playing Wordle. We have 6 tries to guess a 5-letter secret word.
 Since it's the first guess, we have no prior feedback. We want to choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 A common strategy is to use a word with common letters and no repeating letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.

 Let's think about the most common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.
 We should pick a word that includes several of these.

 Some good starting words are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has the letters C, R, A, N, E. They are reasonably common and distinct.

 So my first guess will be: CRANEI'm starting with the word ""CRANE"" because it contains common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N), which provide good coverage of frequently used letters in English. This maximizes the chance of getting valuable feedback about the secret word's letters and positions. Since this is the first guess, there's no prior feedback to incorporate.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has R as the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so the secret word has E as the fifth letter)

So we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
1. Has R as the second letter and E as the fifth letter.
2. Avoids the letters C, A, and N (since they are not in the word).
3. Includes other common letters to test for their presence.

Common letters we haven't tested yet: S, T, I, O, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

We can try to use a word that has S, T, or other common consonants and vowels in the first, third, and fourth positions.

Possible words: 
- We need a 5-letter word with pattern _ R _ _ E.

Let's think of words that fit: 
- TRADE (but A is not in the word, so avoid A)
- PRICE (but C is not in the word, so avoid C)
- BRIDE (B, R, I, D, E) -> pattern: B R I D E

Check the letters: 
- B: not tested yet
- I: not tested
- D: not tested

Also, we avoid C, A, N.

So ""BRIDE"" is a candidate.

Another option: ""GRIME"" (G, R, I, M, E) -> G R I M E

But we don't know about G, I, M.

Another: ""WRITE"" (W, R, I, T, E) -> W R I T E

We could also consider ""TRIPE"" (T, R, I, P, E) -> T R I P E

But note that we have E at the end and R in the second position.

We want to test as many new letters as possible. Since we have two positions to figure out (first, third, fourth) but we have three positions to fill (first, third, fourth) and we can test multiple letters.

Let me list some words that fit the pattern and avoid C, A, N:
- BRINE (but N is not in the word, so avoid) -> invalid
- TRICE (C is not allowed) -> invalid
- PRUNE (P, R, U, N, E) -> N is not allowed -> invalid
- BRUTE (B, R, U, T, E) -> avoids C, A, N. Letters: B, U, T are new.
- GRIPE (G, R, I, P, E) -> G, I, P new.
- WRITE (W, R, I, T, E) -> W, I, T new.

Among these, ""BRUTE"", ""GRIPE"", ""WRITE"" are valid.

We might also consider ""PRIDE"" (P, R, I, D, E) -> P, I, D new.

But note: we have two positions to test: first, third, and fourth. Actually, we have three positions: 1, 3, 4.

We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback. So we should choose a word with common letters that we haven't tested.

We haven't tested: B, D, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but avoid C, A, N).

Common letters: S, T, I, O, L, etc.

We can try to include S, T, or I.

But note: we have to have R in second and E in fifth.

A word like ""TRITE"" (T, R, I, T, E) -> but it has duplicate T, which might not be efficient because if T is in the word, we might not know which position.

Better to have all distinct letters where possible.

So ""BRUTE"": B, R, U, T, E -> distinct: B, U, T are new.
""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E -> distinct: P, I, D.
""GRIPE"": G, R, I, P, E -> distinct: G, I, P.
""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> distinct: W, I, T.

We also have to consider that the word must be valid.

Another candidate: ""DRIVE"" (D, R, I, V, E) -> D, I, V.

But V is less common.

I think ""BRUTE"" is a good choice because it tests B, U, T.

Alternatively, ""TRIPE"" (T, R, I, P, E) -> T, I, P.

But let's see the frequency of letters.

We know the secret word has R and E, and doesn't have C, A, N.

We need to test for the presence of other vowels? We have U in ""BRUTE"", I in ""PRIDE"", etc.

Since we have only one vowel slot (positions 1,3,4) but actually we can have multiple vowels.

We should test a vowel in the third or fourth position.

In ""BRUTE"", we have U in the third and T in the fourth.

In ""PRIDE"", we have I in the third and D in the fourth.

I think both are reasonable.

But note: we have E at the end, so the word might have another vowel in the middle.

I'll go with ""BRUTE"" because it tests three common consonants: B, U, T.

So my second guess: BRUTE

But let me confirm: 
- First letter: B
- Second: R (fixed)
- Third: U
- Fourth: T
- Fifth: E (fixed)

And we avoid C, A, N.

So, <guess>BRUTE</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- R is in the correct position (second letter, marked ""✓"").
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter, marked ""✓"").

This means the secret word has the pattern: `_ R _ _ E`, and it **excludes** C, A, and N.

For the second guess:
- The word must have R as the second letter and E as the fifth letter.
- It should avoid using C, A, or N.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with common untested letters (B, U, T) in the other positions to probe for presence/position.

""BRUTE"" fits this perfectly:
- B (new letter) in position 1.
- U (new vowel) in position 3.
- T (common consonant) in position 4.
- All letters are distinct, increasing the chance of useful feedback.

<guess>BRUTE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: BRUTE -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) U(x) T(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. CRANE: 
   - C: not in word (x)
   - R: correct position (second letter) (✓)
   - A: not in word (x)
   - N: not in word (x)
   - E: correct position (fifth letter) (✓)

2. BRUTE:
   - B: not in word (x)
   - R: correct position (second letter) (✓)
   - U: not in word (x)
   - T: in word but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not in the fourth position) (-)
   - E: correct position (fifth letter) (✓)

So, from the feedback, we know:

- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E
- The letter T is in the word, but not in the fourth position.
- We have eliminated the letters: C, A, N, B, U (since they are marked as not in the word).
- The letters R and E are confirmed and in the correct positions (second and fifth).

Therefore, the secret word must be of the form: [not C,A,N,B,U] R [not C,A,N,B,U and not T?] [not C,A,N,B,U] E

But note: T is in the word, but not in the fourth position. So T must be in either the first or the third position? Actually, the positions are 1, 3, and 4. But we know T is not in position 4, so T must be in position 1 or 3.

Also, we have to consider that the word has exactly 5 letters and we know two of them (R and E). We know T is present, so it must be in position 1 or 3.

We have eliminated: A, B, C, N, U.

We have confirmed: R, E, T (present, but position unknown except not 4).

Now, we need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that:
- Fits the pattern: _ R _ _ E
- Includes T in either position 1 or 3 (to test where T is, and also to get more information about other letters)
- Avoids the eliminated letters: A, B, C, N, U.
- Uses new common letters to test for the remaining positions.

The remaining positions are 1, 3, and 4. We know T is in the word but not in 4, so T must be in 1 or 3.

We can try to use a word that puts T in position 1 and then new letters in 3 and 4, or T in position 3 and new letters in 1 and 4.

But note: we also need to consider that the word must be valid.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and include T.

Option 1: T in position 1 -> T R _ _ E
Option 2: T in position 3 -> _ R T _ E

We should also try to cover more common letters that we haven't tested. We haven't tested: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Common letters: S, T (we know it's in), O, I, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can try to include S, O, I, L, etc.

Let me list some candidate words:

For Option 1 (T in position 1):
- TRADE (but A is eliminated) -> invalid
- TRIPE (P and I, but we haven't tested) -> T R I P E -> but we have to avoid A, B, C, N, U -> I and P are new. However, we don't know if I or P are in the word.
- TRICE (C is eliminated) -> invalid
- TRIKE (K and E, but E is already at end) -> T R I K E -> K is new.
- TRIPE and TRIKE are possibilities.

But note: we have E at the end, so in TRIKE, the E is at the end which is correct, but we are testing T in first.

For Option 2 (T in position 3):
- We need a word: _ R T _ E
- Examples: WRITE (W, R, I, T, E) -> but W and I are new. However, we have eliminated B, but W is not eliminated. Also, we have U eliminated, but W is okay.
- But note: in WRITE, the T is in the fourth position? Wait, positions: 1:W, 2:R, 3:I, 4:T, 5:E -> so T is in position 4? But we know from feedback that T is not in position 4 (from BRUTE feedback: T is in the word but not in position 4). So WRITE has T in position 4, which is not allowed because we know T is not in position 4.

Therefore, we cannot have T in position 4. So for Option 2, we put T in position 3, then the word is: _ R T _ E, so the fourth position must be a different letter.

Examples:
- ARTIC (but A is eliminated) -> invalid
- ORTET (not a common word, and T repeated) -> not good
- We need common words: 
  - PRICE (C eliminated) -> invalid
  - GRIME: G R I M E -> but no T? We need T in the word. We are putting T in position 3? GRIME has no T. 
  - We need a word with T in position 3: so the pattern is _ R T _ E.

Let me think: 
- WRITE is invalid because T is in position 4.
- What about ""RITZE""? Not common.
- ""FRITZ"" but no E at the end.

Actually, the word must end with E. So we need: _ R T _ E.

Possible words: 
- ARTIC is not and A is out.
- ORTET? Not a word.
- I found: ""WROTE"" -> W R O T E -> but T is in position 4? Positions: 1:W, 2:R, 3:O, 4:T, 5:E -> again T in position 4, which is not allowed.

So it's hard to find a word with T in position 3 and ending with E? Because the fourth letter must be something else.

Another idea: ""GRATE"" -> but A is eliminated.

""TRITE"" -> T R I T E -> but T is repeated? And T in position 1 and 4? But we know T is not in position 4, so TRITE has T in 1 and 4, but position 4 is invalid.

We must avoid position 4 for T.

So let's list words that have T in position 1 or 3 and avoid the eliminated letters.

Position 1: T R _ _ E
- TRIPE: T R I P E -> I and P are new, and avoids A,B,C,N,U.
- TRIKE: T R I K E -> I and K are new.
- TRIPE seems better because P is more common than K.

Position 3: _ R T _ E
- We need a word with T in the third position and the fourth position is not T and not an eliminated letter.
- Example: ""DRIVE"" -> D R I V E -> no T.
- ""PRATE"" -> A eliminated.
- ""WRITE"" -> T in position 4, not 3.
- ""FRETE""? Not common.
- ""CRWTH""? Not 5 letters and no E.

It seems difficult. Maybe ""ORTET"" is not a word. Let me think of common words.

Another: ""PARTE"" -> A eliminated.

Perhaps ""DIRTY"" -> but doesn't end with E.

So maybe it's easier to go with T in position 1.

We can also consider that T might be in position 1, and then we test two new letters in 3 and 4.

But note: we have to avoid using eliminated letters.

So let's go with TRIPE: T R I P E

But wait, in TRIPE, the E is at the end, which is correct, and R is in the second, which is correct. We are testing T in position 1, I in position 3, P in position 4.

If we get feedback that T is correct in position 1, then we know T is in the first position. If not, then T must be in position 3 (since it's in the word and not in 4, and we are testing position 1).

But if we use TRIPE and T is actually in position 3, then in TRIPE, T is in position 1 which is wrong, so we might get T marked as present but wrong position? But we know T is in the word, so if it's not in position 1, it would be marked as (-) for T.

But we are also testing I and P.

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't have T in position 1 or 4, but has T in position 3? But we don't have a good word for that.

Another candidate: ""STORE"" -> S T O R E -> but R is in position 4? Pattern: S T O R E -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need R in position 2, not 4. So that doesn't fit the pattern.

We must have R in position 2 and E in position 5.

So back to TRIPE.

We can also consider ""TRICE"" but C is eliminated.

""TRIBE"" but B is eliminated.

So TRIPE seems a good candidate.

Another option: ""TRADE"" is out because of A.

""TROPE"" -> T R O P E -> O and P are new. This is also a valid word.

So we have two options: TRIPE (I and P) or TROPE (O and P).

Which one to choose? We want to test more common letters.

I is more common than O? In English, E, T, A, O, I, N, ... so O is more common than I? Actually, O is more common than I.

But we have already eliminated A and N, so O and I are both good.

But we can also consider that we might get more information.

Another idea: we know T is in the word, so if we put T in position 1 and it is correct, then we get a lot of information. If it's not, then we know T must be in position 3.

So let's choose TRIPE.

But note: in TRIPE, we are using I and P. We haven't tested S, O, L, D, etc.

We could choose a word that includes S, which is very common.

For example, ""TRESE"" is not a word.

""TRUSS"" doesn't end with E.

""PRISE"" -> P R I S E -> but we don't have T? We need to include T because we want to test its position.

We must include T in the guess because we know it's in the word and we need to find its position.

So the guess must include T.

Therefore, for the pattern _ R _ _ E, we can have T in 1 or 3.

Since we don't have a good word with T in 3, we go with T in 1.

So I choose TRIPE.

But let me check if there is a word with T in position 3: 

- ""ORTET"" is not valid.
- ""IRATE"" -> A eliminated.
- ""URATE"" -> U eliminated.
- ""CRATE"" -> C eliminated.

So no, so TRIPE or TROPE.

I think TRIPE is fine.

But we have to avoid U, and TRIPE doesn't have U.

So I'll go with TRIPE.

But wait, in the feedback for BRUTE, T was marked as present but not in position 4. In TRIPE, we are putting T in position 1 and P in position 4. If T is actually in position 3, then in TRIPE, T in position 1 would be marked as present but wrong position, and we would know that T is not in 1, so it must be in 3.

Then we can use that in the next guess.

Similarly, we get information about I and P.

So let's do that.

Third guess: TRIPE

But note: the word is TRIPE: T, R, I, P, E.

We know R and E are fixed and correct, so we are really testing T, I, P.

Now, we must output the guess.

So <guess>TRIPE</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: `C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)`  
  - **R** is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).  
  - **E** is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).  
  - **C, A, N** are not in the secret word.  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ R _ _ E`.  

- **Guess 2: BRUTE** → Feedback: `B(x) R(✓) U(x) T(-) E(✓)`  
  - **R** and **E** are confirmed in positions 2 and 5 (no change).  
  - **T** is in the secret word but **not in position 4**.  
  - **B** and **U** are not in the secret word.  
  - Updated secret word pattern: `_ R _ _ E`, with **T** present but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1 or 3).  
  - Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, B, U** (cannot be in the secret word).  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
1. The secret word must match the pattern `_ R _ _ E`.  
2. **T** must be included in the guess, but **not in position 4** (since feedback confirmed it is in the word but misplaced there).  
3. Avoid eliminated letters: **C, A, N, B, U**.  
4. Test new common letters to gather more information (e.g., **S, I, O, P, D, L, M**).  
5. Prioritize words with distinct unused letters to maximize feedback.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test the position of T**: Since **T** must be in position 1 or 3, we can use a word that places **T** in position 1 (e.g., `T R _ _ E`). This helps:  
  - If **T** is correct in position 1, we lock in the first letter.  
  - If **T** is marked as misplaced (`-`), it must be in position 3.  
- **Probe new common letters**: Use untested letters like **I** and **P** (high-frequency consonants) in positions 3 and 4 to check for presence/position.  
- **Avoid redundancy**: Skip words with eliminated letters or repeated letters.  

### Why ""TRIPE""?
- **Fits the pattern**: `T R I P E` → Tests **T** in position 1, **I** in position 3, **P** in position 4.  
- **Tests key letters**:  
  - **T** (known to be in the word, position to be determined).  
  - **I** (common vowel, untested).  
  - **P** (common consonant, untested).  
- **Avoids eliminated letters**: No **C, A, N, B, U**.  
- **Distinct letters**: All 5 letters are unique, maximizing information potential.  
- **Expected feedback**:  
  - If **T** is in position 1, it will show `✓`; if not, it will show `-` (confirming **T** is in position 3).  
  - **I** and **P** will reveal if they are present and in the right positions.

So T must be in either the first or the third position? Actually, the positions are 1, 3, and 4.

We know T is present, so it must be in position 1 or 3.\n\nWe have eliminated: A, B, C, N, U.\n\nWe have confirmed: R, E, T (present, but position unknown except not 4).\n\nNow, we need to make a third guess. We should choose a word that:\n- Fits the pattern: _ R _ _ E\n- Includes T in either position 1 or 3 (to test where T is, and also to get more information about other letters)\n- Avoids the eliminated letters: A, B, C, N, U.\n- Uses new common letters to test for the remaining positions.\n\nThe remaining positions are 1, 3, and 4. We know T is in the word but not in 4, so T must be in 1 or 3.\n\nWe can try to use a word that puts T in position 1 and then new letters in 3 and 4, or T in position 3 and new letters in 1 and 4.\n\nBut note: we also need to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern and include T.\n\nOption 1: T in position 1 -> T R _ _ E\nOption 2: T in position 3 -> _ R T _ E\n\nWe should also try to cover more common letters that we haven\'t tested. We haven\'t tested: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nCommon letters: S, T (we know it\'s in), O, I, L, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try to include S, O, I, L, etc.\n\nLet me list some candidate words:\n\nFor Option 1 (T in position 1):\n- TRADE (but A is eliminated) -> invalid\n- TRIPE (P and I, but we haven\'t tested) -> T R I P E -> but we have to avoid A, B, C, N, U -> I and P are new. However, we don\'t know if I or P are in the word.\n- TRICE (C is eliminated) -> invalid\n- TRIKE (K and E, but E is already at end) -> T R I K E -> K is new.\n- TRIPE and TRIKE are possibilities.\n\nBut note: we have E at the end, so in TRIKE, the E is at the end which is correct, but we are testing T in first.\n\nFor Option 2 (T in position 3):\n- We need a word: _ R T _ E\n- Examples: WRITE (W, R, I, T, E) -> but W and I are new. However, we have eliminated B, but W is not eliminated. Also, we have U eliminated, but W is okay.\n- But note: in WRITE, the T is in the fourth position? Wait, positions: 1:W, 2:R, 3:I, 4:T, 5:E -> so T is in position 4? But we know from feedback that T is not in position 4 (from BRUTE feedback: T is in the word but not in position 4). So WRITE has T in position 4, which is not allowed because we know T is not in position 4.\n\nTherefore, we cannot have T in position 4. So for Option 2, we put T in position 3, then the word is: _ R T _ E, so the fourth position must be a different letter.\n\nExamples:\n- ARTIC (but A is eliminated) -> invalid\n- ORTET (not a common word, and T repeated) -> not good\n- We need common words: \n  - PRICE (C eliminated) -> invalid\n  - GRIME: G R I M E -> but no T? We need T in the word. We are putting T in position 3? GRIME has no T. \n  - We need a word with T in position 3: so the pattern is _ R T _ E.\n\nLet me think: \n- WRITE is invalid because T is in position 4.\n- What about ""RITZE""? Not common.\n- ""FRITZ"" but no E at the end.\n\nActually, the word must end with E. So we need: _ R T _ E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ARTIC is not and A is out.\n- ORTET? Not a word.\n- I found: ""WROTE"" -> W R O T E -> but T is in position 4? Positions: 1:W, 2:R, 3:O, 4:T, 5:E -> again T in position 4, which is not allowed.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find a word with T in position 3 and ending with E? Because the fourth letter must be something else.\n\nAnother idea: ""GRATE"" -> but A is eliminated.\n\n""TRITE"" -> T R I T E -> but T is repeated? And T in position 1 and 4? But we know T is not in position 4, so TRITE has T in 1 and 4, but position 4 is invalid.\n\nWe must avoid position 4 for T.\n\nSo let\'s list words that have T in position 1 or 3 and avoid the eliminated letters.\n\nPosition 1: T R _ _ E\n- TRIPE: T R I P E -> I and P are new, and avoids A,B,C,N,U.\n- TRIKE: T R I K E -> I and K are new.\n- TRIPE seems better because P is more common than K.\n\nPosition 3: _ R T _ E\n- We need a word with T in the third position and the fourth position is not T and not an eliminated letter.\n- Example: ""DRIVE"" -> D R I V E -> no T.\n- ""PRATE"" -> A eliminated.\n- ""WRITE"" -> T in position 4, not 3.\n- ""FRETE""? Not common.\n- ""CRWTH""? Not 5 letters and no E.\n\nIt seems difficult. Maybe ""ORTET"" is not a word. Let me think of common words.\n\nAnother: ""PARTE"" -> A eliminated.\n\nPerhaps ""DIRTY"" -> but doesn\'t end with E.\n\nSo maybe it\'s easier to go with T in position 1.\n\nWe can also consider that T might be in position 1, and then we test two new letters in 3 and 4.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid using eliminated letters.\n\nSo let\'s go with TRIPE: T R I P E\n\nBut wait, in TRIPE, the E is at the end, which is correct, and R is in the second, which is correct. We are testing T in position 1, I in position 3, P in position 4.\n\nIf we get feedback that T is correct in position 1, then we know T is in the first position. If not, then T must be in position 3 (since it\'s in the word and not in 4, and we are testing position 1).\n\nBut if we use TRIPE and T is actually in position 3, then in TRIPE, T is in position 1 which is wrong, so we might get T marked as present but wrong position? But we know T is in the word, so if it\'s not in position 1, it would be marked as (-) for T.\n\nBut we are also testing I and P.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that doesn\'t have T in position 1 or 4, but has T in position 3? But we don\'t have a good word for that.\n\nAnother candidate: ""STORE"" -> S T O R E -> but R is in position 4? Pattern: S T O R E -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need R in position 2, not 4. So that doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\nWe must have R in position 2 and E in position 5.\n\nSo back to TRIPE.\n\nWe can also consider ""TRICE"" but C is eliminated.\n\n""TRIBE"" but B is eliminated.\n\nSo TRIPE seems a good candidate.\n\nAnother option: ""TRADE"" is out because of A.\n\n""TROPE"" -> T R O P E -> O and P are new. This is also a valid word.\n\nSo we have two options: TRIPE (I and P) or TROPE (O and P).\n\nWhich one to choose? We want to test more common letters.\n\nI is more common than O? In English, E, T, A, O, I, N, ... so O is more common than I? Actually, O is more common than I.\n\nBut we have already eliminated A and N, so O and I are both good.\n\nBut we can also consider that we might get more information.\n\nAnother idea: we know T is in the word, so if we put T in position 1 and it is correct, then we get a lot of information. If it\'s not, then we know T must be in position 3.\n\nSo let\'s choose TRIPE.\n\nBut note: in TRIPE, we are using I and P. We haven\'t tested S, O, L, D, etc.\n\nWe could choose a word that includes S, which is very common.\n\nFor example, ""TRESE"" is not a word.\n\n""TRUSS"" doesn\'t end with E.\n\n""PRISE"" -> P R I S E -> but we don\'t have T? We need to include T because we want to test its position.\n\nWe must include T in the guess because we know it\'s in the word and we need to find its position.\n\nSo the guess must include T.\n\nTherefore, for the pattern _ R _ _ E, we can have T in 1 or 3.\n\nSince we don\'t have a good word with T in 3, we go with T in 1.\n\nSo I choose TRIPE.\n\nBut let me check if there is a word with T in position 3: \n\n- ""ORTET"" is not valid.\n- ""IRATE"" -> A eliminated.\n- ""URATE"" -> U eliminated.\n- ""CRATE"" -> C eliminated.\n\nSo no, so TRIPE or TROPE.\n\nI think TRIPE is fine.\n\nBut we have to avoid U, and TRIPE doesn\'t have U.\n\nSo I\'ll go with TRIPE.\n\nBut wait, in the feedback for BRUTE, T was marked as present but not in position 4. In TRIPE, we are putting T in position 1 and P in position 4. If T is actually in position 3, then in TRIPE, T in position 1 would be marked as present but wrong position, and we would know that T is not in 1, so it must be in 3.\n\nThen we can use that in the next guess.\n\nSimilarly, we get information about I and P.\n\nSo let\'s do that.\n\nThird guess: TRIPE\n\nBut note: the word is TRIPE: T, R, I, P, E.\n\nWe know R and E are fixed and correct, so we are really testing T, I, P.\n\nNow, we must output the guess.\n\nSo <guess>TRIPE</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: `C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)`  \n  - **R** is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).  \n  - **E** is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 5).  \n  - **C, A, N** are not in the secret word.  \n  - Secret word pattern: `_ R _ _ E`.  \n\n- **Guess 2: BRUTE** → Feedback: `B(x) R(✓) U(x) T(-) E(✓)`  \n  - **R** and **E** are confirmed in positions 2 and 5 (no change).  \n  - **T** is in the secret word but **not in position 4**.  \n  - **B** and **U** are not in the secret word.  \n  - Updated secret word pattern: `_ R _ _ E`, with **T** present but not in position 4 (so it must be in position 1 or 3).  \n  - Eliminated letters: **C, A, N, B, U** (cannot be in the secret word).  \n\n### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:\n1.

2. BRUTE: B(x), R(✓), U(x), T(-), E(✓)
   - R and E are confirmed at positions 2 and 5. T is present but not at position 4. B and U are absent.

3. TRIPE: T(✓), R(✓), I(x), P(✓), E(✓)
   - T is at position 1, R at 2, P at 4, E at 5. I is absent.

So from all the feedback:

- The secret word has the pattern: T R _ P E
  - Position 1: T (from TRIPE feedback: T is correct)
  - Position 2: R (known from first guess)
  - Position 4: P (from TRIPE: P is correct)
  - Position 5: E (known from first guess)

- The only missing letter is at position 3.

- We know the following letters are absent: C, A, N, B, U, I (from the x's in the feedback).

- We also know that T is at position 1, so it cannot be at position 3. Similarly, R, P, E are fixed and not at position 3.

- Therefore, the secret word is of the form: T R ? P E, where ? is a letter that is not C, A, N, B, U, I, and also not T, R, P, E (since those are already placed and we assume no duplicates unless indicated, but we have no indication of duplicates so far).

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits T R _ P E.

The missing letter must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated and hasn't been used in the word yet (except for the fixed positions).

Eliminated letters: A, B, C, I, N, U.

We have used: T, R, P, E.

So the available letters are the remaining letters of the alphabet, excluding A, B, C, I, N, U, T, R, P, E.

List of available letters: D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to find a word that fits ""TR?PE"". We can try to think of common words.

Common words with the pattern ""TR?PE"":

- TRIPE: but we already tried it, and I is absent, so it's not the word.
- TRAPE: but A is absent, so invalid.
- TROPE: T R O P E -> O is available.

Is ""TROPE"" a word? Yes, it means a figurative or metaphorical use of a word.

Other possibilities:

- TRUPE: but U is absent.
- TRIPE: already tried and I absent.
- TRAPE: A absent.

What about ""TRIPE"" we know is not. So ""TROPE"" is a candidate.

Are there others?

- TRMPE? Not a word.
- TRKPE? Not a word.
- TRLPE? Not a word.

So ""TROPE"" seems a good candidate.

But we haven't tested O yet, so it's a possibility.

Another word: ""STRAP"" doesn't fit the pattern.

Or ""CRAMP"" doesn't fit.

So likely ""TROPE"" is the only common word.

But let's confirm: T R O P E.

We have O available, and it's a valid English word.

We could also consider if there are other words, but I think ""TROPE"" is the most common.

Since we have only one position left, and we have limited guesses, we can guess ""TROPE"" directly.

But note: we have 6 tries, and this is the fourth guess. We can also try to use a word that tests multiple possibilities, but since only one letter is missing, it's efficient to guess the word.

We don't have any other information to gather about other letters because we know all positions except one, and we have a candidate.

So I think we should guess ""TROPE"".

But let's make sure that O is not eliminated. From the feedback, we have not tested O before, and it's not in the eliminated list.

Eliminated: A, B, C, I, N, U.

So O is free.

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""TROPE"".

But we must confirm: is there any other word?

Another possibility: ""TRIPE"" is out. ""TRAPE"" is out. ""TRUPE"" is out.

""TRIBE"" is out because B and I are out.

""TRICE"" is out because C and I.

So I think ""TROPE"" is the only common word.

Therefore, we guess ""TROPE"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: `C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)`  
  - **R** (position 2) and **E** (position 5) are confirmed.  
  - **C, A, N** are eliminated (not in the word).  
- **Guess 2: BRUTE** → Feedback: `B(x) R(✓) U(x) T(-) E(✓)`  
  - **T** is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - **B, U** are eliminated.  
- **Guess 3: TRIPE** → Feedback: `T(✓) R(✓) I(x) P(✓) E(✓)`  
  - **T** (position 1), **R** (position 2), **P** (position 4), and **E** (position 5) are confirmed.  
  - **I** is eliminated.  

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word pattern is **T R _ P E** (only position 3 is unknown).  
2. **Eliminated letters**: A, B, C, I, N, U (cannot be in the word).  
3. **Confirmed letters**: T, R, P, E (fixed in positions 1, 2, 4, 5).  
4. The missing letter (position 3) must be:  
   - A valid English letter not eliminated (i.e., not A, B, C, I, N, U).  
   - Not T, R, P, or E (since these are already placed and no duplicates are indicated).  
   - Common remaining letters: D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- The only unknown is position 3. We need a valid 5-letter word fitting **T R ? P E**.  
- **TROPE** (meaning a recurring theme or metaphor) is the **only common English word** that fits:  
  - **T** (pos 1), **R** (pos 2), **O** (pos 3), **P** (pos 4), **E** (pos 5).  
- **O** is untested and not eliminated, making it a strong candidate.  
- No other common words fit the pattern (e.g., ""TRIPE"" was tried and eliminated; ""TRAPE"" uses eliminated letter A; ""TRUPE"" uses eliminated letter U).  
- Since 4 letters are confirmed, guessing **TROPE** efficiently solves the puzzle if correct.  

<guess>TROPE</guess>",TROPE,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

1. CRANE: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(✓)
   - So R is in the word at position 2, E is at position 5, and C, A, N are absent.

2. BRUTE: B(x), R(✓), U(x), T(-), E(✓)
   - R and E are confirmed at positions 2 and 5. T is present but not at position 4. B and U are absent.

3. TRIPE: T(✓), R(✓), I(x), P(✓), E(✓)
   - T is at position 1, R at 2, P at 4, E at 5. I is absent.
