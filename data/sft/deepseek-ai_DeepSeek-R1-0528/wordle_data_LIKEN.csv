We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word at all (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is also in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So, the secret word contains:
- N (but not in the fourth position, since in ""crane"" N was at position 4 and it was marked wrong position)
- E (not in the fifth position, since in ""crane"" E was at position 5)

Also, the secret word does NOT contain: C, R, A.

Since N and E are present but not in the positions we guessed, we must use other letters.

We have to avoid C, R, A.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Test new letters to find other characters in the word.
- Possibly reposition N and E to other positions to see where they belong.

Note: The word has 5 letters, so the positions are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Since N is present (but not at position 4), and E is present (but not at position 5), they must be in positions 1,2,3 or for N it can be in 1,2,3,5? But wait, E is at the end? Actually, positions 1,2,3,4,5 but we know not at the original spots.

However, we can try to put them in different positions.

We also know that the word does not have C, R, A, so we avoid those.

Common consonants and vowels: we have E already (a vowel) so we might need more vowels? Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. But we know A is out. So vowels available: E (we already have), and we can try I, O, U.

But we have only one E? Actually, the feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, but typically in Wordle, each letter is considered individually. If there are duplicates, it might be tricky, but we don't know.

Given that, let's think of a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E, but not at the same positions as before (so not position 4 for N, not position 5 for E).
- Also, we want to test other common letters.

We can put N and E in different positions and add other letters that are common.

What are other common letters? Consider: T, S, L, I, O, U, etc.

For example, we can try to put E in a position other than 5, and N in a position other than 4.

Let me consider positions:

Possible words: 
- Option: Have E at the beginning? But then might conflict. Or in the middle.

We need to cover multiple possibilities.

Another good starting word might be to test more vowels and common consonants.

But we already have two vowels ruled out: A is out, and E is present. So we need at least another vowel? Typically, English words have vowels like E, and then one of I, O, U.

So let's try a word with E, N, and then new letters.

Example words:

We know E is present: so we can try E at position 1? But if we put E at the beginning, and it's correct then we get a check. Similarly, move N around.

What about ""LINEN""? But let's check: it has L, I, N, E, N. But note: possibly duplicate N? Also, does it avoid C, R, A? Yes.

But wait, the word must be 5 distinct letters? No, duplicates are allowed. So let's see the positions in ""LINEN"": 
Position1: L
Position2: I
Position3: N
Position4: E
Position5: N

Now, in our feedback, in the first guess we had N at position 4 marked as '-' (present but wrong position) and E at position 5 marked as '-' (present but wrong position).

In this word, we have:
- Position3: N
- Position4: E -> but in our first guess, E was at position5. Now we are putting E at position4? So if the secret word has E at position4, then it would be correct? But we don't know.
Similarly, N at position3 and also at position5.

But we also are introducing new letters: L and I.

Alternatively, let's avoid duplicate N for now? Since we don't know if there are duplicates.

Another idea: use a word that uses common letters and avoids C, R, A.

Let me list common letters without C, R, A: E, S, T, L, I, O, N, etc.

So a good candidate might be ""STONE"": 
- S, T, O, N, E

This has:
- S at position1
- T at position2
- O at position3
- N at position4 -> but wait, in first guess we had N at position4 and it was marked as '-' meaning N is present but not at position4. So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be wrong? Because we know it's not at position4. So that would be redundant.

So avoid putting N at position4 again.

Similarly, avoid putting E at position5.

In ""STONE"", N is at position4 (same as before) and E at position5 (same as before). So we would likely get the same feedback for those positions? So not helpful.

Thus, we might choose a word that moves N and E to other positions.

How about ""HONEY""? 
- H, O, N, E, Y

Positions:
1: H
2: O
3: N -> now we put N at position3 (previously it was at position4, which is wrong)
4: E -> now E at position4 (previously it was at position5, which was wrong)
5: Y

So we are testing N at position3 and E at position4, which are new positions.

Also, we introduce H, O, Y.

But the word must be a valid English word. ""HONEY"" is valid.

Alternatively, ""NOISE"": N,O,I,S,E
Positions:
1: N -> testing N at position1
2: O
3: I
4: S
5: E -> testing E at position5 again? We know E is not at position5 because in the first guess it was marked as wrong position. So if we put E at position5 again, we know it will be marked '-' again? So that doesn't give new information.

To maximize new information, avoid the positions we know are wrong.

So avoid:
- position4 for N (since we already know N is not at position4)
- position5 for E (since we know E is not at position5)

Thus, for the next guess, we should put N in positions 1,2,3 or 5? But position5 is currently occupied by E? Not necessarily.

We can assign:
- N: try positions 1,2,3,5? (avoid 4)
- E: try positions 1,2,3,4? (avoid 5)

So we have flexibility.

Let me try to form a word that has N at a position that is not 4 and E at a position that is not 5, and includes other common letters.

For example:
- ""UNITE"": U,N,I,T,E
Positions: 
1: U
2: N -> N at position2? That's new.
3: I
4: T
5: E -> but position5 is the same? We know E is not at 5? So if we put E at position5, we will get '-' again? And we know that already.

So we want to avoid E at position5? Yes.

Therefore, only positions 1,2,3,4 for E.

So in ""UNITE"", E is at position5? So avoid that.

Another try: ""BEGIN"": B,E,G,I,N
Positions:
1: B
2: E -> E at position2? That's new? Previously E was at position5.
3: G
4: I
5: N -> N at position5? That's new? Previously N was at position4.

This avoids the known wrong positions: 
- E not at position5? Now at position2? Which is new.
- N not at position4? Now at position5? Which is new.

Also, letters: B, E, G, I, N -> avoid C,R,A? Yes.

Is ""BEGIN"" a valid guess? Yes, common word.

The secret word does not have duplicates? We don't know, so it should be okay.

Alternatively, ""ENDOW"": E,N,D,O,W
Positions:
1: E -> E at position1? New.
2: N -> N at position2? New.
3: D
4: O
5: W? But E and N are both moved? But the word must be valid? ""ENDOW"" is valid.

We might want to prioritize high-frequency letters? For example, test T or S? Because we haven't tested T or S yet.

In our first guess ""crane"", we tested: C (x), R (x), A (x), N (-), E (-) -> so we haven't tested T, S, O, I, L, etc.

So including T or S might be helpful.

Thus, perhaps ""STOEN""? Not a word.

""SONET""? Not common.

""STINE""? Not very common.

How about ""STEIN"": S,T,E,I,N
Positions:
1: S
2: T
3: E -> E at position3? Previously E was at position5? So avoid 5? Now position3? New.
4: I
5: N -> N at position5? Previously N was at position4? So avoid 4? Now position5? New.

This word is valid? Yes, ""STEIN"" is acceptable (as in beer mug or a surname).

This way, we are testing two new positions for E and N, and we are introducing S, T, I.

We avoid C,R,A.

Alternatively, ""SPINE"": S,P,I,N,E -> N at position4? But that is the same as before? We know N is not at position4? So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be '-'? So that's not new information? Actually, if we put N at position4 and it was already known to not be there, it will be marked as '-', but we already know it's in the word? So we don't learn anything new? So we should avoid position4 for N.

In ""SPINE"", N is at position4? So that's redundant? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate: 
- S, T, E, I, N
- E at position3? Previously E was at position5? Which we know is wrong? We try position3? Which might be correct? Or wrong? Let's see.
- N at position5? Previously at position4 (wrong)? Now at position5? That's a new position.

Similarly, we test S, T, I.

Another alternative: maybe we try to cover more vowels? In ""STEIN"", we have E and I? That's good.

So I'll go with ""STEIN"".

Therefore, guess: STEIN

But note: in the feedback we know E is present, and we are moving it? Same with N.

Alternatively, ""BEING"": B,E,I,N,G -> but E at position2? and N at position4? But position4 for N we already know? So avoid? 

Because N at position4? We know it's not at position4? So we expect it to be marked as '-', but we already know that? So no new information? So inefficient.

Therefore, better to move N to a new position? So in ""STEIN"", N is at position5? That's a new position? So we get new information? Yes? Because if the secret word has N at position5, then we get ✓? Or if not, but still present? Then it will be '-'? Which tells us it's in the word but position5 is also wrong? Then we know not to put N at position4 nor position5? Then we have fewer positions? So we learn.

Similarly for E at position3? We know E is present? But if we put E at position3 and it's correct? We get ✓? Or if not, then '-'? Then we know it's not at position3? So we learn a new wrong position? And that is helpful.

So indeed, we learn about the positions.

Therefore, let's use ""STEIN"".

### Thought Process

After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-), I inferred the following:
- **C, R, A are absent** from the secret word. This means any new guess must avoid these letters.
- **N is present but not in position 4** (since it was marked as wrong position in ""crane""). 
- **E is present but not in position 5** (marked as wrong position in ""crane""). 

The goal of the second guess is to:
1. Test N and E in new positions (avoiding position 4 for N and position 5 for E) to gather more information about their correct locations.
2. Introduce new common letters to maximize learning, focusing on untested consonants (like S, T, I) and vowels (like O or U), since A is ruled out.
  
After considering words that fit these criteria:
- Avoid words placing N at position 4 or E at position 5, as this would waste a guess by confirming known information.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., S, T, I) to increase the chance of hits.
- Ensure the word is valid and avoids C, R, A.

I evaluated several options:
- ""BEGIN"" (B,E,G,I,N) tests E at position 2 and N at position 5, but it misses common letters like S or T.
- ""UNITE"" (U,N,I,T,E) places E at position 5 (avoids this), so discarded.
- ""HONEY"" (H,O,N,E,Y) tests N at position 3 and E at position 4, but includes less common letters like Y.
- ""STEIN"" (S,T,E,I,N) emerged as a strong candidate because:
  - It tests E at position 3 (a new position, avoiding position 5).
  - It tests N at position 5 (a new position, avoiding position 4).
  - It introduces new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I (vowels not ruled out yet).
  - It avoids C, R, A entirely.
  
""STEIN"" is a valid English word and provides optimal position testing for E and N while maximizing coverage of untested letters.

### Guess
<guess>stein</guess>",stein,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word at all (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is also in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So, the secret word contains:
- N (but not in the fourth position, since in ""crane"" N was at position 4 and it was marked wrong position)
- E (not in the fifth position, since in ""crane"" E was at position 5)

Also, the secret word does NOT contain: C, R, A.

Since N and E are present but not in the positions we guessed, we must use other letters.

We have to avoid C, R, A.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Test new letters to find other characters in the word.
- Possibly reposition N and E to other positions to see where they belong.

Note: The word has 5 letters, so the positions are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Since N is present (but not at position 4), and E is present (but not at position 5), they must be in positions 1,2,3 or for N it can be in 1,2,3,5? But wait, E is at the end? Actually, positions 1,2,3,4,5 but we know not at the original spots.

However, we can try to put them in different positions.

We also know that the word does not have C, R, A, so we avoid those.

Common consonants and vowels: we have E already (a vowel) so we might need more vowels? Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. But we know A is out. So vowels available: E (we already have), and we can try I, O, U.

But we have only one E? Actually, the feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, but typically in Wordle, each letter is considered individually. If there are duplicates, it might be tricky, but we don't know.

Given that, let's think of a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E, but not at the same positions as before (so not position 4 for N, not position 5 for E).
- Also, we want to test other common letters.

We can put N and E in different positions and add other letters that are common.

What are other common letters? Consider: T, S, L, I, O, U, etc.

For example, we can try to put E in a position other than 5, and N in a position other than 4.

Let me consider positions:

Possible words: 
- Option: Have E at the beginning? But then might conflict. Or in the middle.

We need to cover multiple possibilities.

Another good starting word might be to test more vowels and common consonants.

But we already have two vowels ruled out: A is out, and E is present. So we need at least another vowel? Typically, English words have vowels like E, and then one of I, O, U.

So let's try a word with E, N, and then new letters.

Example words:

We know E is present: so we can try E at position 1? But if we put E at the beginning, and it's correct then we get a check. Similarly, move N around.

What about ""LINEN""? But let's check: it has L, I, N, E, N. But note: possibly duplicate N? Also, does it avoid C, R, A? Yes.

But wait, the word must be 5 distinct letters? No, duplicates are allowed. So let's see the positions in ""LINEN"": 
Position1: L
Position2: I
Position3: N
Position4: E
Position5: N

Now, in our feedback, in the first guess we had N at position 4 marked as '-' (present but wrong position) and E at position 5 marked as '-' (present but wrong position).

In this word, we have:
- Position3: N
- Position4: E -> but in our first guess, E was at position5. Now we are putting E at position4? So if the secret word has E at position4, then it would be correct? But we don't know.
Similarly, N at position3 and also at position5.

But we also are introducing new letters: L and I.

Alternatively, let's avoid duplicate N for now? Since we don't know if there are duplicates.

Another idea: use a word that uses common letters and avoids C, R, A.

Let me list common letters without C, R, A: E, S, T, L, I, O, N, etc.

So a good candidate might be ""STONE"": 
- S, T, O, N, E

This has:
- S at position1
- T at position2
- O at position3
- N at position4 -> but wait, in first guess we had N at position4 and it was marked as '-' meaning N is present but not at position4. So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be wrong? Because we know it's not at position4. So that would be redundant.

So avoid putting N at position4 again.

Similarly, avoid putting E at position5.

In ""STONE"", N is at position4 (same as before) and E at position5 (same as before). So we would likely get the same feedback for those positions? So not helpful.

Thus, we might choose a word that moves N and E to other positions.

How about ""HONEY""? 
- H, O, N, E, Y

Positions:
1: H
2: O
3: N -> now we put N at position3 (previously it was at position4, which is wrong)
4: E -> now E at position4 (previously it was at position5, which was wrong)
5: Y

So we are testing N at position3 and E at position4, which are new positions.

Also, we introduce H, O, Y.

But the word must be a valid English word. ""HONEY"" is valid.

Alternatively, ""NOISE"": N,O,I,S,E
Positions:
1: N -> testing N at position1
2: O
3: I
4: S
5: E -> testing E at position5 again? We know E is not at position5 because in the first guess it was marked as wrong position. So if we put E at position5 again, we know it will be marked '-' again? So that doesn't give new information.

To maximize new information, avoid the positions we know are wrong.

So avoid:
- position4 for N (since we already know N is not at position4)
- position5 for E (since we know E is not at position5)

Thus, for the next guess, we should put N in positions 1,2,3 or 5? But position5 is currently occupied by E? Not necessarily.

We can assign:
- N: try positions 1,2,3,5? (avoid 4)
- E: try positions 1,2,3,4? (avoid 5)

So we have flexibility.

Let me try to form a word that has N at a position that is not 4 and E at a position that is not 5, and includes other common letters.

For example:
- ""UNITE"": U,N,I,T,E
Positions: 
1: U
2: N -> N at position2? That's new.
3: I
4: T
5: E -> but position5 is the same? We know E is not at 5? So if we put E at position5, we will get '-' again? And we know that already.

So we want to avoid E at position5? Yes.

Therefore, only positions 1,2,3,4 for E.

So in ""UNITE"", E is at position5? So avoid that.

Another try: ""BEGIN"": B,E,G,I,N
Positions:
1: B
2: E -> E at position2? That's new? Previously E was at position5.
3: G
4: I
5: N -> N at position5? That's new? Previously N was at position4.

This avoids the known wrong positions: 
- E not at position5? Now at position2? Which is new.
- N not at position4? Now at position5? Which is new.

Also, letters: B, E, G, I, N -> avoid C,R,A? Yes.

Is ""BEGIN"" a valid guess? Yes, common word.

The secret word does not have duplicates? We don't know, so it should be okay.

Alternatively, ""ENDOW"": E,N,D,O,W
Positions:
1: E -> E at position1? New.
2: N -> N at position2? New.
3: D
4: O
5: W? But E and N are both moved? But the word must be valid? ""ENDOW"" is valid.

We might want to prioritize high-frequency letters? For example, test T or S? Because we haven't tested T or S yet.

In our first guess ""crane"", we tested: C (x), R (x), A (x), N (-), E (-) -> so we haven't tested T, S, O, I, L, etc.

So including T or S might be helpful.

Thus, perhaps ""STOEN""? Not a word.

""SONET""? Not common.

""STINE""? Not very common.

How about ""STEIN"": S,T,E,I,N
Positions:
1: S
2: T
3: E -> E at position3? Previously E was at position5? So avoid 5? Now position3? New.
4: I
5: N -> N at position5? Previously N was at position4? So avoid 4? Now position5? New.

This word is valid? Yes, ""STEIN"" is acceptable (as in beer mug or a surname).

This way, we are testing two new positions for E and N, and we are introducing S, T, I.

We avoid C,R,A.

Alternatively, ""SPINE"": S,P,I,N,E -> N at position4? But that is the same as before? We know N is not at position4? So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be '-'? So that's not new information? Actually, if we put N at position4 and it was already known to not be there, it will be marked as '-', but we already know it's in the word? So we don't learn anything new? So we should avoid position4 for N.

In ""SPINE"", N is at position4? So that's redundant? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate: 
- S, T, E, I, N
- E at position3? Previously E was at position5? Which we know is wrong? We try position3? Which might be correct? Or wrong? Let's see.
- N at position5? Previously at position4 (wrong)? Now at position5? That's a new position.

Similarly, we test S, T, I.

Another alternative: maybe we try to cover more vowels? In ""STEIN"", we have E and I? That's good.

So I'll go with ""STEIN"".

Therefore, guess: STEIN

But note: in the feedback we know E is present, and we are moving it? Same with N.

Alternatively, ""BEING"": B,E,I,N,G -> but E at position2? and N at position4? But position4 for N we already know? So avoid? 

Because N at position4? We know it's not at position4? So we expect it to be marked as '-', but we already know that? So no new information? So inefficient.

Therefore, better to move N to a new position? So in ""STEIN"", N is at position5? That's a new position? So we get new information? Yes? Because if the secret word has N at position5, then we get ✓? Or if not, but still present? Then it will be '-'? Which tells us it's in the word but position5 is also wrong? Then we know not to put N at position4 nor position5? Then we have fewer positions? So we learn.

Similarly for E at position3? We know E is present? But if we put E at position3 and it's correct? We get ✓? Or if not, then '-'? Then we know it's not at position3? So we learn a new wrong position? And that is helpful.

So indeed, we learn about the positions.

Therefore, let's use ""STEIN"".

<guess>stein</guess>### Thought Process

After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-), I inferred the following:
- **C, R, A are absent** from the secret word. This means any new guess must avoid these letters.
- **N is present but not in position 4** (since it was marked as wrong position in ""crane""). 
- **E is present but not in position 5** (marked as wrong position in ""crane""). 

The goal of the second guess is to:
1. Test N and E in new positions (avoiding position 4 for N and position 5 for E) to gather more information about their correct locations.
2. Introduce new common letters to maximize learning, focusing on untested consonants (like S, T, I) and vowels (like O or U), since A is ruled out.
  
After considering words that fit these criteria:
- Avoid words placing N at position 4 or E at position 5, as this would waste a guess by confirming known information.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., S, T, I) to increase the chance of hits.
- Ensure the word is valid and avoids C, R, A.

I evaluated several options:
- ""BEGIN"" (B,E,G,I,N) tests E at position 2 and N at position 5, but it misses common letters like S or T.
- ""UNITE"" (U,N,I,T,E) places E at position 5 (avoids this), so discarded.
- ""HONEY"" (H,O,N,E,Y) tests N at position 3 and E at position 4, but includes less common letters like Y.
- ""STEIN"" (S,T,E,I,N) emerged as a strong candidate because:
  - It tests E at position 3 (a new position, avoiding position 5).
  - It tests N at position 5 (a new position, avoiding position 4).
  - It introduces new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I (vowels not ruled out yet).
  - It avoids C, R, A entirely.
  
""STEIN"" is a valid English word and provides optimal position testing for E and N while maximizing coverage of untested letters.

### Guess",Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,LIKEN,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word at all (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is also in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So, the secret word contains:
- N (but not in the fourth position, since in ""crane"" N was at position 4 and it was marked wrong position)
- E (not in the fifth position, since in ""crane"" E was at position 5)

Also, the secret word does NOT contain: C, R, A.

Since N and E are present but not in the positions we guessed, we must use other letters.

We have to avoid C, R, A.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Test new letters to find other characters in the word.
- Possibly reposition N and E to other positions to see where they belong.

Note: The word has 5 letters, so the positions are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Since N is present (but not at position 4), and E is present (but not at position 5), they must be in positions 1,2,3 or for N it can be in 1,2,3,5? But wait, E is at the end? Actually, positions 1,2,3,4,5 but we know not at the original spots.

However, we can try to put them in different positions.

We also know that the word does not have C, R, A, so we avoid those.

Common consonants and vowels: we have E already (a vowel) so we might need more vowels? Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. But we know A is out. So vowels available: E (we already have), and we can try I, O, U.

But we have only one E? Actually, the feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, but typically in Wordle, each letter is considered individually. If there are duplicates, it might be tricky, but we don't know.

Given that, let's think of a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E, but not at the same positions as before (so not position 4 for N, not position 5 for E).
- Also, we want to test other common letters.

We can put N and E in different positions and add other letters that are common.

What are other common letters? Consider: T, S, L, I, O, U, etc.

For example, we can try to put E in a position other than 5, and N in a position other than 4.

Let me consider positions:

Possible words: 
- Option: Have E at the beginning? But then might conflict. Or in the middle.

We need to cover multiple possibilities.

Another good starting word might be to test more vowels and common consonants.

But we already have two vowels ruled out: A is out, and E is present. So we need at least another vowel? Typically, English words have vowels like E, and then one of I, O, U.

So let's try a word with E, N, and then new letters.

Example words:

We know E is present: so we can try E at position 1? But if we put E at the beginning, and it's correct then we get a check. Similarly, move N around.

What about ""LINEN""? But let's check: it has L, I, N, E, N. But note: possibly duplicate N? Also, does it avoid C, R, A? Yes.

But wait, the word must be 5 distinct letters? No, duplicates are allowed. So let's see the positions in ""LINEN"": 
Position1: L
Position2: I
Position3: N
Position4: E
Position5: N

Now, in our feedback, in the first guess we had N at position 4 marked as '-' (present but wrong position) and E at position 5 marked as '-' (present but wrong position).

In this word, we have:
- Position3: N
- Position4: E -> but in our first guess, E was at position5. Now we are putting E at position4? So if the secret word has E at position4, then it would be correct? But we don't know.
Similarly, N at position3 and also at position5.

But we also are introducing new letters: L and I.

Alternatively, let's avoid duplicate N for now? Since we don't know if there are duplicates.

Another idea: use a word that uses common letters and avoids C, R, A.

Let me list common letters without C, R, A: E, S, T, L, I, O, N, etc.

So a good candidate might be ""STONE"": 
- S, T, O, N, E

This has:
- S at position1
- T at position2
- O at position3
- N at position4 -> but wait, in first guess we had N at position4 and it was marked as '-' meaning N is present but not at position4. So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be wrong? Because we know it's not at position4. So that would be redundant.

So avoid putting N at position4 again.

Similarly, avoid putting E at position5.

In ""STONE"", N is at position4 (same as before) and E at position5 (same as before). So we would likely get the same feedback for those positions? So not helpful.

Thus, we might choose a word that moves N and E to other positions.

How about ""HONEY""? 
- H, O, N, E, Y

Positions:
1: H
2: O
3: N -> now we put N at position3 (previously it was at position4, which is wrong)
4: E -> now E at position4 (previously it was at position5, which was wrong)
5: Y

So we are testing N at position3 and E at position4, which are new positions.

Also, we introduce H, O, Y.

But the word must be a valid English word. ""HONEY"" is valid.

Alternatively, ""NOISE"": N,O,I,S,E
Positions:
1: N -> testing N at position1
2: O
3: I
4: S
5: E -> testing E at position5 again? We know E is not at position5 because in the first guess it was marked as wrong position. So if we put E at position5 again, we know it will be marked '-' again? So that doesn't give new information.

To maximize new information, avoid the positions we know are wrong.

So avoid:
- position4 for N (since we already know N is not at position4)
- position5 for E (since we know E is not at position5)

Thus, for the next guess, we should put N in positions 1,2,3 or 5? But position5 is currently occupied by E? Not necessarily.

We can assign:
- N: try positions 1,2,3,5? (avoid 4)
- E: try positions 1,2,3,4? (avoid 5)

So we have flexibility.

Let me try to form a word that has N at a position that is not 4 and E at a position that is not 5, and includes other common letters.

For example:
- ""UNITE"": U,N,I,T,E
Positions: 
1: U
2: N -> N at position2? That's new.
3: I
4: T
5: E -> but position5 is the same? We know E is not at 5? So if we put E at position5, we will get '-' again? And we know that already.

So we want to avoid E at position5? Yes.

Therefore, only positions 1,2,3,4 for E.

So in ""UNITE"", E is at position5? So avoid that.

Another try: ""BEGIN"": B,E,G,I,N
Positions:
1: B
2: E -> E at position2? That's new? Previously E was at position5.
3: G
4: I
5: N -> N at position5? That's new? Previously N was at position4.

This avoids the known wrong positions: 
- E not at position5? Now at position2? Which is new.
- N not at position4? Now at position5? Which is new.

Also, letters: B, E, G, I, N -> avoid C,R,A? Yes.

Is ""BEGIN"" a valid guess? Yes, common word.

The secret word does not have duplicates? We don't know, so it should be okay.

Alternatively, ""ENDOW"": E,N,D,O,W
Positions:
1: E -> E at position1? New.
2: N -> N at position2? New.
3: D
4: O
5: W? But E and N are both moved? But the word must be valid? ""ENDOW"" is valid.

We might want to prioritize high-frequency letters? For example, test T or S? Because we haven't tested T or S yet.

In our first guess ""crane"", we tested: C (x), R (x), A (x), N (-), E (-) -> so we haven't tested T, S, O, I, L, etc.

So including T or S might be helpful.

Thus, perhaps ""STOEN""? Not a word.

""SONET""? Not common.

""STINE""? Not very common.

How about ""STEIN"": S,T,E,I,N
Positions:
1: S
2: T
3: E -> E at position3? Previously E was at position5? So avoid 5? Now position3? New.
4: I
5: N -> N at position5? Previously N was at position4? So avoid 4? Now position5? New.

This word is valid? Yes, ""STEIN"" is acceptable (as in beer mug or a surname).

This way, we are testing two new positions for E and N, and we are introducing S, T, I.

We avoid C,R,A.

Alternatively, ""SPINE"": S,P,I,N,E -> N at position4? But that is the same as before? We know N is not at position4? So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be '-'? So that's not new information? Actually, if we put N at position4 and it was already known to not be there, it will be marked as '-', but we already know it's in the word? So we don't learn anything new? So we should avoid position4 for N.

In ""SPINE"", N is at position4? So that's redundant? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate: 
- S, T, E, I, N
- E at position3? Previously E was at position5? Which we know is wrong? We try position3? Which might be correct? Or wrong? Let's see.
- N at position5? Previously at position4 (wrong)? Now at position5? That's a new position.

Similarly, we test S, T, I.

Another alternative: maybe we try to cover more vowels? In ""STEIN"", we have E and I? That's good.

So I'll go with ""STEIN"".

Therefore, guess: STEIN

But note: in the feedback we know E is present, and we are moving it? Same with N.

Alternatively, ""BEING"": B,E,I,N,G -> but E at position2? and N at position4? But position4 for N we already know? So avoid? 

Because N at position4? We know it's not at position4? So we expect it to be marked as '-', but we already know that? So no new information? So inefficient.

Therefore, better to move N to a new position? So in ""STEIN"", N is at position5? That's a new position? So we get new information? Yes? Because if the secret word has N at position5, then we get ✓? Or if not, but still present? Then it will be '-'? Which tells us it's in the word but position5 is also wrong? Then we know not to put N at position4 nor position5? Then we have fewer positions? So we learn.

Similarly for E at position3? We know E is present? But if we put E at position3 and it's correct? We get ✓? Or if not, then '-'? Then we know it's not at position3? So we learn a new wrong position? And that is helpful.

So indeed, we learn about the positions.

So avoid that.\n\nAnother try: ""BEGIN"": B,E,G,I,N\nPositions:\n1: B\n2: E -> E at position2? That\'s new? Previously E was at position5.\n3: G\n4: I\n5: N -> N at position5? That\'s new? Previously N was at position4.\n\nThis avoids the known wrong positions: \n- E not at position5? Now at position2? Which is new.\n- N not at position4? Now at position5? Which is new.\n\nAlso, letters: B, E, G, I, N -> avoid C,R,A? Yes.\n\nIs ""BEGIN"" a valid guess? Yes, common word.\n\nThe secret word does not have duplicates? We don\'t know, so it should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, ""ENDOW"": E,N,D,O,W\nPositions:\n1: E -> E at position1? New.\n2: N -> N at position2? New.\n3: D\n4: O\n5: W? But E and N are both moved? But the word must be valid? ""ENDOW"" is valid.\n\nWe might want to prioritize high-frequency letters? For example, test T or S? Because we haven\'t tested T or S yet.\n\nIn our first guess ""crane"", we tested: C (x), R (x), A (x), N (-), E (-) -> so we haven\'t tested T, S, O, I, L, etc.\n\nSo including T or S might be helpful.\n\nThus, perhaps ""STOEN""? Not a word.\n\n""SONET""? Not common.\n\n""STINE""? Not very common.\n\nHow about ""STEIN"": S,T,E,I,N\nPositions:\n1: S\n2: T\n3: E -> E at position3? Previously E was at position5? So avoid 5? Now position3? New.\n4: I\n5: N -> N at position5? Previously N was at position4? So avoid 4? Now position5? New.\n\nThis word is valid? Yes, ""STEIN"" is acceptable (as in beer mug or a surname).\n\nThis way, we are testing two new positions for E and N, and we are introducing S, T, I.\n\nWe avoid C,R,A.\n\nAlternatively, ""SPINE"": S,P,I,N,E -> N at position4? But that is the same as before? We know N is not at position4? So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be \'-\'? So that\'s not new information? Actually, if we put N at position4 and it was already known to not be there, it will be marked as \'-\', but we already know it\'s in the word? So we don\'t learn anything new? So we should avoid position4 for N.\n\nIn ""SPINE"", N is at position4? So that\'s redundant? Yes.\n\nTherefore, I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate: \n- S, T, E, I, N\n- E at position3? Previously E was at position5? Which we know is wrong? We try position3? Which might be correct? Or wrong? Let\'s see.\n- N at position5? Previously at position4 (wrong)? Now at position5? That\'s a new position.\n\nSimilarly, we test S, T, I.\n\nAnother alternative: maybe we try to cover more vowels? In ""STEIN"", we have E and I? That\'s good.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STEIN"".\n\nTherefore, guess: STEIN\n\nBut note: in the feedback we know E is present, and we are moving it? Same with N.\n\nAlternatively, ""BEING"": B,E,I,N,G -> but E at position2? and N at position4? But position4 for N we already know? So avoid? \n\nBecause N at position4? We know it\'s not at position4? So we expect it to be marked as \'-\', but we already know that? So no new information? So inefficient.\n\nTherefore, better to move N to a new position? So in ""STEIN"", N is at position5? That\'s a new position? So we get new information? Yes? Because if the secret word has N at position5, then we get ✓? Or if not, but still present? Then it will be \'-\'? Which tells us it\'s in the word but position5 is also wrong? Then we know not to put N at position4 nor position5? Then we have fewer positions? So we learn.\n\nSimilarly for E at position3? We know E is present? But if we put E at position3 and it\'s correct? We get ✓? Or if not, then \'-\'? Then we know it\'s not at position3? So we learn a new wrong position? And that is helpful.\n\nSo indeed, we learn about the positions.\n\nTherefore, let\'s use ""STEIN"".\n\n<guess>stein</guess>### Thought Process\n\nAfter reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-), I inferred the following:\n- **C, R, A are absent** from the secret word. This means any new guess must avoid these letters.\n- **N is present but not in position 4** (since it was marked as wrong position in ""crane""). \n- **E is present but not in position 5** (marked as wrong position in ""crane""). \n\nThe goal of the second guess is to:\n1. Test N and E in new positions (avoiding position 4 for N and position 5 for E) to gather more information about their correct locations.\n2. Introduce new common letters to maximize learning, focusing on untested consonants (like S, T, I) and vowels (like O or U), since A is ruled out.\n  \nAfter considering words that fit these criteria:\n- Avoid words placing N at position 4 or E at position 5, as this would waste a guess by confirming known information.\n- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., S, T, I) to increase the chance of hits.\n- Ensure the word is valid and avoids C, R, A.\n\nI evaluated several options:\n- ""BEGIN"" (B,E,G,I,N) tests E at position 2 and N at position 5, but it misses common letters like S or T.\n- ""UNITE"" (U,N,I,T,E) places E at position 5 (avoids this), so discarded.\n- ""HONEY"" (H,O,N,E,Y) tests N at position 3 and E at position 4, but includes less common letters like Y.\n- ""STEIN"" (S,T,E,I,N) emerged as a strong candidate because:\n  - It tests E at position 3 (a new position, avoiding position 5).\n  - It tests N at position 5 (a new position, avoiding position 4).\n  - It introduces new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I (vowels not ruled out yet).\n  - It avoids C, R, A entirely.\n  \n""STEIN"" is a valid English word and provides optimal position testing for E and N while maximizing coverage of untested letters.\n\n### Guess\n\n<guess>stein</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are absent from the word.
- N is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).
- E is present but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).

Guess 2: ""stein"" -> S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)
Meaning:
- S and T are absent from the word.
- E is present but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in ""stein"" and marked as wrong position).
- I is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""stein"" and marked as wrong position).
- N is present and in the correct position: position 5 (since it was in position 5 in ""stein"" and marked as correct).

So, from both feedbacks, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T
Present letters: N (correctly placed at position 5), E (present but not in position 3 or 5), I (present but not in position 4)

Also, note that E was also not in position 5 from the first guess, so E is not in position 3 or 5. Similarly, N is fixed at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 5: N (fixed)
- The letter E is in the word, but not in positions 3 or 5. So it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 4. So it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we have 5 letters, so we need to find two more letters.

We know the word has at least E, I, and N (with N at the end).

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T.
- Includes E (in a position that is not 3 or 5, so 1, 2, or 4) and I (in a position that is not 4, so 1, 2, or 3).
- Since N is fixed at position 5, we don't need to move it.

We also want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

Common letters we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

But note: we have two positions to fill (besides the known N at the end) and we have to place E and I in the remaining positions? Actually, the word has 5 positions. We know position 5 is N. So positions 1,2,3,4 are to be filled with E, I, and two other letters? Or possibly E and I are two of them, and we need two more? But we don't know if there are duplicates? However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far? But we can't rule out duplicates? But let's assume no duplicates for now? Because if there were duplicates, the feedback might have shown? But not necessarily? For example, if a letter appears twice, the feedback might show both? But in this case, we don't have any duplicate feedback? So we proceed with the assumption of no duplicates? But we should be cautious.

So the word has: 
- Position 5: N
- E is in one of positions 1,2,4? (but not 3 or 5)
- I is in one of positions 1,2,3? (but not 4)

But note: positions 1 and 2 are common for both E and I? So they could be in the same position? No, because each position can have only one letter? So we have to assign E and I to different positions? And then two more letters? But we have only 4 positions? Positions 1,2,3,4? And we have to place E and I in two of them? And then two other letters? But we have 5 letters? Position 5 is fixed? So we have 4 positions? And we have two known letters (E and I) to place? So we need two more unknown letters? Yes.

But we also have to consider that E and I might be in the word only once? So we have to assign E to one of {1,2,4} and I to one of {1,2,3}? But they can't be in the same position? So the possible positions for E and I are:

- If E is at 1, then I can be at 2 or 3.
- If E is at 2, then I can be at 1 or 3.
- If E is at 4, then I can be at 1,2, or 3.

But we also have two more letters to place? So we have to fill the remaining two positions with new letters? And we have to avoid C,R,A,S,T.

So for the next guess, we want to:
- Place E in one of the positions 1,2,4? But we don't know which? So we can choose one? And similarly for I? But we want to maximize information? So we might choose a word that tests E and I in positions that are likely? Or we can choose a word that tests new letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities? But we have to pick one word.

We can also try to use a word that has E and I in positions that we haven't ruled out? And also includes two new common letters.

For example, let's try to put E at position 4? Because in the first guess, E was at 5? Then in the second guess, E was at 3? So we haven't tested position 4 for E? And we haven't tested positions 1 and 2? But we can test position 4 for E? And for I, we can test position 1? Or 2? Or 3? But we already tested I at position 4? Which was wrong? So we can test I at position 1? Or 2? Or 3? We haven't tested any of these? So we can choose.

But note: if we put E at position 4? Then we can test if E is at position 4? If it is, we get a ✓? If not, we get a '-'? But if we get a '-', then we know E is not at position 4? Then it must be at 1 or 2? Similarly, we can test I at a new position.

But we also want to test new letters? So let's form a word.

For example, let's put E at position 4? Then we need to put I at one of 1,2,3? And then two new letters? And N at 5.

So the word: _ _ _ E N

We need to fill the first three positions? But one of them must be I? And the other two are new letters? And we avoid C,R,A,S,T.

So possible words? 

We can try: 
- Position 1: I? Then position 2 and 3: new letters? But I at position1? We haven't tested that? So we can try? Then the word: I ? ? E N

What words? Like ""IDIOM""? But that has D and M? But also O? And it's 5 letters? ""IDIOM"" has two I's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we have I already? So if we put I at position1? Then we have I at position1 and also in the word? But we don't know if the word has two I's? So it might be? But let's avoid duplicates for now? Because we haven't seen any? So we assume no duplicates? Then we cannot have two I's? So we cannot use ""IDIOM"" because it has two I's? Actually, ""IDIOM"" has I at position1 and position4? But position4 is E? So not? ""IDIOM"" is I,D,I,O,M? So two I's? So we avoid? Because we are assuming no duplicates? So we want a word with distinct letters? But the rules don't require distinct? But to avoid complexity, we can try to use distinct letters? But if we use a duplicate, we might get feedback that tells us? But for now, let's try to avoid? Because we have limited guesses? So we try to use distinct letters.

So for the word: I ? ? E N, with distinct letters? And ? are not C,R,A,S,T? And not E or I? Because E is at position4? And I at position1? So the middle two are new? And distinct? And not E or I? And not C,R,A,S,T.

So possible words: 
- ""ITEM""? But T is absent? We know T is absent? So cannot use T? 
- ""IDIOM"" has duplicate I? And T? Not? 
- ""IMAGE""? But M,A? A is absent? 
- ""INLET""? But N is at position5? And we have I at position1? Then L,E? But E is at position4? So ""INLET"" is I,N,L,E,T? But T is absent? And N is at position2? But we already have N at position5? And we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot have two N's? So avoid? 
- ""ICED""? Only 4 letters? 
- ""IDLER""? But R is absent? 
- ""IGLOO""? But duplicate O? And O? But also L? But ""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O? Duplicate O? And 5 letters? But we have E? We need E at position4? So not? 

Alternatively, put E at position4? And I at position2? Then the word: ? I ? E N

So positions: 1: new letter, 2: I, 3: new letter, 4: E, 5: N

Then the word: _ I _ E N

Possible words: 
- ""WIDEN"": W,I,D,E,N -> letters: W, I, D, E, N? Avoid C,R,A,S,T? Yes? And distinct? Yes? 
- ""GIVEN"": G,I,V,E,N? Avoid C,R,A,S,T? Yes? 
- ""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? 
- ""MIXEN""? Not common? 
- ""PIXEL""? But E at position4? But L at position5? But we need N at position5? So not? 
- ""WIDEN"", ""GIVEN"", ""LIVEN"" are options.

But we have to choose one? We can test two new letters? For example, in ""WIDEN"": we test W and D? 
In ""GIVEN"": G and V? 
In ""LIVEN"": L and V? 

Common letters: D, G, L, V, W? D and L are more common? 

But we also want to test the positions? We are putting E at position4? And I at position2? 

If we choose ""WIDEN"", we test:
- Position1: W? If it's present? 
- Position2: I? We know I is present? But we are testing position2? If I is at position2, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? 
- Position3: D? 
- Position4: E? We are testing if E is at position4? 
- Position5: N (already correct? So we get ✓? But we know that? So it will be marked ✓? 

Similarly for others.

But note: we are testing two things: 
1. Is E at position4? 
2. Is I at position2? 
3. And we test two new letters: for ""WIDEN"", we test W and D? 

If we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? If not, then E must be at position1 or 2? But if we put I at position2? Then if E is at position2? But we are putting I at position2? Then E cannot be at position2? Because one letter per position? So if we put I at position2, then E cannot be at position2? So if E is not at position4? Then it must be at position1? Because positions 3 and 5 are ruled out? And position2 is taken by I? 

Similarly, if we put I at position2? Then if I is not at position2? We get '-'? Then I must be at position1 or 3? 

But we are also testing new letters? 

Alternatively, we can put E at position1? Then the word: E ? ? ? N? And we need to put I at one of 2,3? And two new letters? 

But we haven't tested position1 for E? So we can try? 

For example: E ? ? ? N? With I at position2 or 3? 

But we have to fill? 

But let's see? We have more flexibility? 

But we have to choose one? 

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has both E and I? And also includes two common letters? And we choose positions that are not ruled out? 

But we have to avoid the absent letters? 

Let me list the possible positions for E and I? 

E: positions 1,2,4? (avoid 3,5)
I: positions 1,2,3? (avoid 4)

But they cannot be in the same position? 

So the possible pairs (E position, I position):
- (1,2): E at 1, I at 2
- (1,3): E at 1, I at 3
- (2,1): E at 2, I at 1
- (2,3): E at 2, I at 3
- (4,1): E at 4, I at 1
- (4,2): E at 4, I at 2
- (4,3): E at 4, I at 3

We have 7 possibilities? But we don't know which? 

We can try to choose a word that tests one of these? And also tests new letters? 

But we have to pick one? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests E at position4? And I at position1? For example? Then we can rule out or confirm? 

So let's try ""GIVEN"": G,I,V,E,N? 
- Position1: G
- Position2: I
- Position3: V
- Position4: E
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position4? 
- I at position2? 
- And new letters G and V? 

But we also test position2 for I? 

If we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? If not, then E must be at position1 or 2? But if I is at position2? Then E cannot be at position2? So if E is not at position4? Then E must be at position1? 

Similarly, if I is at position2? Then we get ✓? If not, then I must be at position1 or 3? 

So we get information? 

Similarly, we test G and V? 

But we can also choose ""WIDEN"": W,I,D,E,N? Same structure? 

But which one? 

""GIVEN"" has G and V? V is less common? W is also less common? 

""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? L is common? 

But we have another option: ""DIVEN""? Not a word? 

""PIXEN""? Not common? 

""BIKED""? But E at position4? But D? And B? But ""BIKED"" is B,I,K,E,D? But we need N at position5? Not? 

So the options are limited? 

Another word: ""OILED""? But E at position5? But we need E at position4? And N at position5? Not? 

""MINED"": M,I,N,E,D? But N at position3? But we have N at position5? And we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot have two N's? So avoid? 

So back to ""WIDEN"", ""GIVEN"", ""LIVEN""? 

I think ""GIVEN"" is a good word? Because G and V are not tested? 

But let's see the frequency? 

Alternatively, we can try to test E at position1? 

For example, ""EXIST""? But S and T are absent? 

""EDWIN""? Not common? 

""ELOIN"": E,L,O,I,N? 
- Position1: E
- Position2: L
- Position3: O
- Position4: I? But we know I is not at position4? Because in guess2, I was at position4 and marked as wrong position? So we cannot put I at position4? 

So avoid? 

""EIGHT"": But T absent? 

""ENVOY"": E,N,V,O,Y? But N at position2? But we have N at position5? Duplicate? Avoid? 

So it's hard to put E at position1? 

Similarly, put E at position2? 

For example, ""LEVIN""? L,E,V,I,N? 
- Position1: L
- Position2: E
- Position3: V
- Position4: I? But I cannot be at position4? Because we know I is not at position4? 

So avoid? 

""BEIGE""? But not 5 letters? And no N? 

""DEIGN"": D,E,I,G,N? 
- Position1: D
- Position2: E
- Position3: I
- Position4: G
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position2? 
- I at position3? 
- New letters D and G? 

And avoids C,R,A,S,T? 

Also, positions: 
- E at position2? We haven't tested that? 
- I at position3? We haven't tested that? 

So this is also a good candidate? 

""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to think or consider? 

So we have two options: 
- ""GIVEN"": tests E at position4 and I at position2? 
- ""DEIGN"": tests E at position2 and I at position3? 

Which one to choose? 

We can choose based on letter frequency? 

But also, we want to cover the positions that are more likely? 

In English, for words ending with N, common patterns? 

But let's see: 

In ""DEIGN"", we test E at position2 and I at position3? 

In ""GIVEN"", we test E at position4 and I at position2? 

But we know that E was not at position5 or 3? So position2 and 4 are possible? Similarly, I was not at position4? So position1,2,3 are possible? 

Both are valid? 

But in ""DEIGN"", we test two new positions: E at position2 and I at position3? 

In ""GIVEN"", we test E at position4 and I at position2? 

We have to choose one? 

I think ""DEIGN"" is a good choice? Because it tests two new positions? And D and G are common? 

But let's see the feedback? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests E at position1? But we couldn't find a good one? 

Another word: ""OWING""? But O,W,I,N,G? But E is missing? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? 

So we must include E? 

So ""DEIGN"" includes E? 

Similarly, ""GIVEN"" includes E? 

I think I'll go with ""DEIGN""? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

If we choose ""DEIGN"": 
- If E is at position2, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? 
- If I is at position3, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? 
- We test D and G? 

Similarly for ""GIVEN""? 

But in ""GIVEN"", if we put I at position2? And if I is not at position2? Then we get '-'? And we know I must be at position1 or 3? 

But in ""DEIGN"", we test I at position3? 

I think both are fine? 

But let's choose ""DEIGN"" because it tests position3 for I? Which we haven't tested? 

So guess: DEIGN

But note: we have to write it in the format? 

But let's confirm the word: D-E-I-G-N

Yes.

So <guess>deign</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
  - **C, R, A are absent** from the secret word.  
  - **N is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(✓)  
  - **S and T are absent** from the secret word.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 3 (and not in position 5, from Guess 1).  
  - **I is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **N is correct and in position 5** (so position 5 is fixed as **N**).  

### Key Insights
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T (cannot be used).  
- **Present letters**:  
  - **N**: Correctly placed at position 5.  
  - **E**: Present but not in positions 3 or 5. Must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
  - **I**: Present but not in position 4. Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
- **Word structure**:  
  - Position 5 is fixed as **N**.  
  - E and I must be placed in the remaining positions (1–4), but not in their invalid positions (E not in 3/5, I not in 4).  
  - Two additional unknown letters are needed to fill positions 1–4 (alongside E and I).  
- **Strategy for next guess**:  
  - Test E and I in new positions to narrow down their locations.  
  - Introduce new common letters (avoiding absent letters: C, R, A, S, T).  
  - Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., D, G, L, M) and vowels (O, U) not yet tested.  
  - Avoid duplicate letters for now (no duplicates indicated in feedback).  

### Choosing the Next Guess: ""DEIGN""
After evaluating options, **""DEIGN""** (D-E-I-G-N) is selected because:  
- **Tests E at position 2**: We know E is not in positions 3 or 5, so position 2 is a new, plausible location.  
- **Tests I at position 3**: We know I is not in position 4, so position 3 is a new, plausible location.  
- **Introduces new common letters**: D and G (high-frequency consonants not ruled out).  
- **Fits the fixed N at position 5**: Confirms the known correct letter/position.  
- **Avoids absent letters**: No C, R, A, S, T.  
- **Valid English word**: ""Deign"" means to do something reluctantly.  

### Expected Outcomes
- If E is in position 2, it will be marked ✓; otherwise, it will be marked - (wrong position).  
- If I is in position 3, it will be marked ✓; otherwise, it will be marked - (wrong position).  
- Feedback on D (position 1) and G (position 4) will reveal if they are in the word (and if so, their positions).  

This guess efficiently narrows down the positions for E and I while testing two new letters.

<guess>deign</guess>",deign,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)

- E is present but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in ""stein"" and marked as wrong position).
- I is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""stein"" and marked as wrong position).
- N is present and in the correct position: position 5 (since it was in position 5 in ""stein"" and marked as correct).

So, from both feedbacks, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T
Present letters: N (correctly placed at position 5), E (present but not in position 3 or 5), I (present but not in position 4)

Also, note that E was also not in position 5 from the first guess, so E is not in position 3 or 5. Similarly, N is fixed at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 5: N (fixed)
- The letter E is in the word, but not in positions 3 or 5. So it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 4. So it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we have 5 letters, so we need to find two more letters.

We know the word has at least E, I, and N (with N at the end).

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T.
- Includes E (in a position that is not 3 or 5, so 1, 2, or 4) and I (in a position that is not 4, so 1, 2, or 3).
- Since N is fixed at position 5, we don't need to move it.

We also want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

Common letters we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

But note: we have two positions to fill (besides the known N at the end) and we have to place E and I in the remaining positions? Actually, the word has 5 positions. We know position 5 is N. So positions 1,2,3,4 are to be filled with E, I, and two other letters? Or possibly E and I are two of them, and we need two more? But we don't know if there are duplicates? However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far? But we can't rule out duplicates? But let's assume no duplicates for now? Because if there were duplicates, the feedback might have shown? But not necessarily? For example, if a letter appears twice, the feedback might show both? But in this case, we don't have any duplicate feedback? So we proceed with the assumption of no duplicates? But we should be cautious.

So the word has: 
- Position 5: N
- E is in one of positions 1,2,4? (but not 3 or 5)
- I is in one of positions 1,2,3? (but not 4)

But note: positions 1 and 2 are common for both E and I? So they could be in the same position? No, because each position can have only one letter? So we have to assign E and I to different positions? And then two more letters? But we have only 4 positions? Positions 1,2,3,4? And we have to place E and I in two of them? And then two other letters? But we have 5 letters? Position 5 is fixed? So we have 4 positions? And we have two known letters (E and I) to place? So we need two more unknown letters? Yes.

But we also have to consider that E and I might be in the word only once? So we have to assign E to one of {1,2,4} and I to one of {1,2,3}? But they can't be in the same position? So the possible positions for E and I are:

- If E is at 1, then I can be at 2 or 3.
- If E is at 2, then I can be at 1 or 3.
- If E is at 4, then I can be at 1,2, or 3.

But we also have two more letters to place? So we have to fill the remaining two positions with new letters? And we have to avoid C,R,A,S,T.

So for the next guess, we want to:
- Place E in one of the positions 1,2,4? But we don't know which? So we can choose one? And similarly for I? But we want to maximize information? So we might choose a word that tests E and I in positions that are likely? Or we can choose a word that tests new letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities? But we have to pick one word.

We can also try to use a word that has E and I in positions that we haven't ruled out? And also includes two new common letters.

For example, let's try to put E at position 4? Because in the first guess, E was at 5? Then in the second guess, E was at 3? So we haven't tested position 4 for E? And we haven't tested positions 1 and 2? But we can test position 4 for E? And for I, we can test position 1? Or 2? Or 3? But we already tested I at position 4? Which was wrong? So we can test I at position 1? Or 2? Or 3? We haven't tested any of these? So we can choose.

But note: if we put E at position 4? Then we can test if E is at position 4? If it is, we get a ✓? If not, we get a '-'? But if we get a '-', then we know E is not at position 4? Then it must be at 1 or 2? Similarly, we can test I at a new position.

But we also want to test new letters? So let's form a word.

For example, let's put E at position 4? Then we need to put I at one of 1,2,3? And then two new letters? And N at 5.

So the word: _ _ _ E N

We need to fill the first three positions? But one of them must be I? And the other two are new letters? And we avoid C,R,A,S,T.

So possible words? 

We can try: 
- Position 1: I? Then position 2 and 3: new letters? But I at position1? We haven't tested that? So we can try? Then the word: I ? ? E N

What words? Like ""IDIOM""? But that has D and M? But also O? And it's 5 letters? ""IDIOM"" has two I's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we have I already? So if we put I at position1? Then we have I at position1 and also in the word? But we don't know if the word has two I's? So it might be? But let's avoid duplicates for now? Because we haven't seen any? So we assume no duplicates? Then we cannot have two I's? So we cannot use ""IDIOM"" because it has two I's? Actually, ""IDIOM"" has I at position1 and position4? But position4 is E? So not? ""IDIOM"" is I,D,I,O,M? So two I's? So we avoid? Because we are assuming no duplicates? So we want a word with distinct letters? But the rules don't require distinct? But to avoid complexity, we can try to use distinct letters? But if we use a duplicate, we might get feedback that tells us? But for now, let's try to avoid? Because we have limited guesses? So we try to use distinct letters.

So for the word: I ? ? E N, with distinct letters? And ? are not C,R,A,S,T? And not E or I? Because E is at position4? And I at position1? So the middle two are new? And distinct? And not E or I? And not C,R,A,S,T.

So possible words: 
- ""ITEM""? But T is absent? We know T is absent? So cannot use T? 
- ""IDIOM"" has duplicate I? And T? Not? 
- ""IMAGE""? But M,A? A is absent? 
- ""INLET""? But N is at position5? And we have I at position1? Then L,E? But E is at position4? So ""INLET"" is I,N,L,E,T? But T is absent? And N is at position2? But we already have N at position5? And we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot have two N's? So avoid? 
- ""ICED""? Only 4 letters? 
- ""IDLER""? But R is absent? 
- ""IGLOO""? But duplicate O? And O? But also L? But ""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O? Duplicate O? And 5 letters? But we have E? We need E at position4? So not? 

Alternatively, put E at position4? And I at position2? Then the word: ? I ? E N

So positions: 1: new letter, 2: I, 3: new letter, 4: E, 5: N

Then the word: _ I _ E N

Possible words: 
- ""WIDEN"": W,I,D,E,N -> letters: W, I, D, E, N? Avoid C,R,A,S,T? Yes? And distinct? Yes? 
- ""GIVEN"": G,I,V,E,N? Avoid C,R,A,S,T? Yes? 
- ""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? 
- ""MIXEN""? Not common? 
- ""PIXEL""? But E at position4? But L at position5? But we need N at position5? So not? 
- ""WIDEN"", ""GIVEN"", ""LIVEN"" are options.

But we have to choose one? We can test two new letters? For example, in ""WIDEN"": we test W and D? 
In ""GIVEN"": G and V? 
In ""LIVEN"": L and V? 

Common letters: D, G, L, V, W? D and L are more common? 

But we also want to test the positions? We are putting E at position4? And I at position2? 

If we choose ""WIDEN"", we test:
- Position1: W? If it's present? 
- Position2: I? We know I is present? But we are testing position2? If I is at position2, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? 
- Position3: D? 
- Position4: E? We are testing if E is at position4? 
- Position5: N (already correct? So we get ✓? But we know that? So it will be marked ✓? 

Similarly for others.

But note: we are testing two things: 
1. Is E at position4? 
2. Is I at position2? 
3. And we test two new letters: for ""WIDEN"", we test W and D? 

If we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? If not, then E must be at position1 or 2? But if we put I at position2? Then if E is at position2? But we are putting I at position2? Then E cannot be at position2? Because one letter per position? So if we put I at position2, then E cannot be at position2? So if E is not at position4? Then it must be at position1? Because positions 3 and 5 are ruled out? And position2 is taken by I? 

Similarly, if we put I at position2? Then if I is not at position2? We get '-'? Then I must be at position1 or 3? 

But we are also testing new letters? 

Alternatively, we can put E at position1? Then the word: E ? ? ? N? And we need to put I at one of 2,3? And two new letters? 

But we haven't tested position1 for E? So we can try? 

For example: E ? ? ? N? With I at position2 or 3? 

But we have to fill? 

But let's see? We have more flexibility? 

But we have to choose one? 

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has both E and I? And also includes two common letters? And we choose positions that are not ruled out? 

But we have to avoid the absent letters? 

Let me list the possible positions for E and I? 

E: positions 1,2,4? (avoid 3,5)
I: positions 1,2,3? (avoid 4)

But they cannot be in the same position? 

So the possible pairs (E position, I position):
- (1,2): E at 1, I at 2
- (1,3): E at 1, I at 3
- (2,1): E at 2, I at 1
- (2,3): E at 2, I at 3
- (4,1): E at 4, I at 1
- (4,2): E at 4, I at 2
- (4,3): E at 4, I at 3

We have 7 possibilities? But we don't know which? 

We can try to choose a word that tests one of these? And also tests new letters? 

But we have to pick one? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests E at position4? And I at position1? For example? Then we can rule out or confirm? 

So let's try ""GIVEN"": G,I,V,E,N? 
- Position1: G
- Position2: I
- Position3: V
- Position4: E
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position4? 
- I at position2? 
- And new letters G and V? 

But we also test position2 for I? 

If we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? If not, then E must be at position1 or 2? But if I is at position2? Then E cannot be at position2? So if E is not at position4? Then E must be at position1? 

Similarly, if I is at position2? Then we get ✓? If not, then I must be at position1 or 3? 

So we get information? 

Similarly, we test G and V? 

But we can also choose ""WIDEN"": W,I,D,E,N? Same structure? 

But which one? 

""GIVEN"" has G and V? V is less common? W is also less common? 

""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? L is common? 

But we have another option: ""DIVEN""? Not a word? 

""PIXEN""? Not common? 

""BIKED""? But E at position4? But D? And B? But ""BIKED"" is B,I,K,E,D? But we need N at position5? Not? 

So the options are limited? 

Another word: ""OILED""? But E at position5? But we need E at position4? And N at position5? Not? 

""MINED"": M,I,N,E,D? But N at position3? But we have N at position5? And we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot have two N's? So avoid? 

So back to ""WIDEN"", ""GIVEN"", ""LIVEN""? 

I think ""GIVEN"" is a good word? Because G and V are not tested? 

But let's see the frequency? 

Alternatively, we can try to test E at position1? 

For example, ""EXIST""? But S and T are absent? 

""EDWIN""? Not common? 

""ELOIN"": E,L,O,I,N? 
- Position1: E
- Position2: L
- Position3: O
- Position4: I? But we know I is not at position4? Because in guess2, I was at position4 and marked as wrong position? So we cannot put I at position4? 

So avoid? 

""EIGHT"": But T absent? 

""ENVOY"": E,N,V,O,Y? But N at position2? But we have N at position5? Duplicate? Avoid? 

So it's hard to put E at position1? 

Similarly, put E at position2? 

For example, ""LEVIN""? L,E,V,I,N? 
- Position1: L
- Position2: E
- Position3: V
- Position4: I? But I cannot be at position4? Because we know I is not at position4? 

So avoid? 

""BEIGE""? But not 5 letters? And no N? 

""DEIGN"": D,E,I,G,N? 
- Position1: D
- Position2: E
- Position3: I
- Position4: G
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position2? 
- I at position3? 
- New letters D and G? 

And avoids C,R,A,S,T? 

Also, positions: 
- E at position2? We haven't tested that? 
- I at position3? We haven't tested that? 

So this is also a good candidate? 

""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to think or consider? 

So we have two options: 
- ""GIVEN"": tests E at position4 and I at position2? 
- ""DEIGN"": tests E at position2 and I at position3? 

Which one to choose? 

We can choose based on letter frequency? 

But also, we want to cover the positions that are more likely? 

In English, for words ending with N, common patterns? 

But let's see: 

In ""DEIGN"", we test E at position2 and I at position3? 

In ""GIVEN"", we test E at position4 and I at position2? 

But we know that E was not at position5 or 3? So position2 and 4 are possible? Similarly, I was not at position4? So position1,2,3 are possible? 

Both are valid? 

But in ""DEIGN"", we test two new positions: E at position2 and I at position3? 

In ""GIVEN"", we test E at position4 and I at position2? 

We have to choose one? 

I think ""DEIGN"" is a good choice? Because it tests two new positions? And D and G are common? 

But let's see the feedback? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests E at position1? But we couldn't find a good one? 

Another word: ""OWING""? But O,W,I,N,G? But E is missing? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? 

So we must include E? 

So ""DEIGN"" includes E? 

Similarly, ""GIVEN"" includes E? 

I think I'll go with ""DEIGN""? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

If we choose ""DEIGN"": 
- If E is at position2, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? 
- If I is at position3, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? 
- We test D and G? 

Similarly for ""GIVEN""? 

But in ""GIVEN"", if we put I at position2? And if I is not at position2? Then we get '-'? And we know I must be at position1 or 3? 

But in ""DEIGN"", we test I at position3? 

I think both are fine? 

But let's choose ""DEIGN"" because it tests position3 for I? Which we haven't tested? 

So guess: DEIGN

But note: we have to write it in the format? 

But let's confirm the word: D-E-I-G-N

Yes.

So <guess>deign</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
  - **C, R, A are absent** from the secret word.  
  - **N is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(✓)  
  - **S and T are absent** from the secret word.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 3 (and not in position 5, from Guess 1).  
  - **I is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **N is correct and in position 5** (so position 5 is fixed as **N**).  

### Key Insights
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T (cannot be used).  
- **Present letters**:  
  - **N**: Correctly placed at position 5.  
  - **E**: Present but not in positions 3 or 5. Must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
  - **I**: Present but not in position 4. Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
- **Word structure**:  
  - Position 5 is fixed as **N**.  
  - E and I must be placed in the remaining positions (1–4), but not in their invalid positions (E not in 3/5, I not in 4).  
  - Two additional unknown letters are needed to fill positions 1–4 (alongside E and I).  
- **Strategy for next guess**:  
  - Test E and I in new positions to narrow down their locations.  
  - Introduce new common letters (avoiding absent letters: C, R, A, S, T).  
  - Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., D, G, L, M) and vowels (O, U) not yet tested.  
  - Avoid duplicate letters for now (no duplicates indicated in feedback).  

### Choosing the Next Guess: ""DEIGN""
After evaluating options, **""DEIGN""** (D-E-I-G-N) is selected because:  
- **Tests E at position 2**: We know E is not in positions 3 or 5, so position 2 is a new, plausible location.  
- **Tests I at position 3**: We know I is not in position 4, so position 3 is a new, plausible location.  
- **Introduces new common letters**: D and G (high-frequency consonants not ruled out).  
- **Fits the fixed N at position 5**: Confirms the known correct letter/position.  
- **Avoids absent letters**: No C, R, A, S, T.  
- **Valid English word**: ""Deign"" means to do something reluctantly.  

### Expected Outcomes
- If E is in position 2, it will be marked ✓; otherwise, it will be marked - (wrong position).  
- If I is in position 3, it will be marked ✓; otherwise, it will be marked - (wrong position).  
- Feedback on D (position 1) and G (position 4) will reveal if they are in the word (and if so, their positions).  

This guess efficiently narrows down the positions for E and I while testing two new letters.",Guess 3: deign -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) I(-) G(x) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,LIKEN,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word at all (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is also in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So, the secret word contains:
- N (but not in the fourth position, since in ""crane"" N was at position 4 and it was marked wrong position)
- E (not in the fifth position, since in ""crane"" E was at position 5)

Also, the secret word does NOT contain: C, R, A.

Since N and E are present but not in the positions we guessed, we must use other letters.

We have to avoid C, R, A.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Test new letters to find other characters in the word.
- Possibly reposition N and E to other positions to see where they belong.

Note: The word has 5 letters, so the positions are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Since N is present (but not at position 4), and E is present (but not at position 5), they must be in positions 1,2,3 or for N it can be in 1,2,3,5? But wait, E is at the end? Actually, positions 1,2,3,4,5 but we know not at the original spots.

However, we can try to put them in different positions.

We also know that the word does not have C, R, A, so we avoid those.

Common consonants and vowels: we have E already (a vowel) so we might need more vowels? Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. But we know A is out. So vowels available: E (we already have), and we can try I, O, U.

But we have only one E? Actually, the feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, but typically in Wordle, each letter is considered individually. If there are duplicates, it might be tricky, but we don't know.

Given that, let's think of a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E, but not at the same positions as before (so not position 4 for N, not position 5 for E).
- Also, we want to test other common letters.

We can put N and E in different positions and add other letters that are common.

What are other common letters? Consider: T, S, L, I, O, U, etc.

For example, we can try to put E in a position other than 5, and N in a position other than 4.

Let me consider positions:

Possible words: 
- Option: Have E at the beginning? But then might conflict. Or in the middle.

We need to cover multiple possibilities.

Another good starting word might be to test more vowels and common consonants.

But we already have two vowels ruled out: A is out, and E is present. So we need at least another vowel? Typically, English words have vowels like E, and then one of I, O, U.

So let's try a word with E, N, and then new letters.

Example words:

We know E is present: so we can try E at position 1? But if we put E at the beginning, and it's correct then we get a check. Similarly, move N around.

What about ""LINEN""? But let's check: it has L, I, N, E, N. But note: possibly duplicate N? Also, does it avoid C, R, A? Yes.

But wait, the word must be 5 distinct letters? No, duplicates are allowed. So let's see the positions in ""LINEN"": 
Position1: L
Position2: I
Position3: N
Position4: E
Position5: N

Now, in our feedback, in the first guess we had N at position 4 marked as '-' (present but wrong position) and E at position 5 marked as '-' (present but wrong position).

In this word, we have:
- Position3: N
- Position4: E -> but in our first guess, E was at position5. Now we are putting E at position4? So if the secret word has E at position4, then it would be correct? But we don't know.
Similarly, N at position3 and also at position5.

But we also are introducing new letters: L and I.

Alternatively, let's avoid duplicate N for now? Since we don't know if there are duplicates.

Another idea: use a word that uses common letters and avoids C, R, A.

Let me list common letters without C, R, A: E, S, T, L, I, O, N, etc.

So a good candidate might be ""STONE"": 
- S, T, O, N, E

This has:
- S at position1
- T at position2
- O at position3
- N at position4 -> but wait, in first guess we had N at position4 and it was marked as '-' meaning N is present but not at position4. So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be wrong? Because we know it's not at position4. So that would be redundant.

So avoid putting N at position4 again.

Similarly, avoid putting E at position5.

In ""STONE"", N is at position4 (same as before) and E at position5 (same as before). So we would likely get the same feedback for those positions? So not helpful.

Thus, we might choose a word that moves N and E to other positions.

How about ""HONEY""? 
- H, O, N, E, Y

Positions:
1: H
2: O
3: N -> now we put N at position3 (previously it was at position4, which is wrong)
4: E -> now E at position4 (previously it was at position5, which was wrong)
5: Y

So we are testing N at position3 and E at position4, which are new positions.

Also, we introduce H, O, Y.

But the word must be a valid English word. ""HONEY"" is valid.

Alternatively, ""NOISE"": N,O,I,S,E
Positions:
1: N -> testing N at position1
2: O
3: I
4: S
5: E -> testing E at position5 again? We know E is not at position5 because in the first guess it was marked as wrong position. So if we put E at position5 again, we know it will be marked '-' again? So that doesn't give new information.

To maximize new information, avoid the positions we know are wrong.

So avoid:
- position4 for N (since we already know N is not at position4)
- position5 for E (since we know E is not at position5)

Thus, for the next guess, we should put N in positions 1,2,3 or 5? But position5 is currently occupied by E? Not necessarily.

We can assign:
- N: try positions 1,2,3,5? (avoid 4)
- E: try positions 1,2,3,4? (avoid 5)

So we have flexibility.

Let me try to form a word that has N at a position that is not 4 and E at a position that is not 5, and includes other common letters.

For example:
- ""UNITE"": U,N,I,T,E
Positions: 
1: U
2: N -> N at position2? That's new.
3: I
4: T
5: E -> but position5 is the same? We know E is not at 5? So if we put E at position5, we will get '-' again? And we know that already.

So we want to avoid E at position5? Yes.

Therefore, only positions 1,2,3,4 for E.

So in ""UNITE"", E is at position5? So avoid that.

Another try: ""BEGIN"": B,E,G,I,N
Positions:
1: B
2: E -> E at position2? That's new? Previously E was at position5.
3: G
4: I
5: N -> N at position5? That's new? Previously N was at position4.

This avoids the known wrong positions: 
- E not at position5? Now at position2? Which is new.
- N not at position4? Now at position5? Which is new.

Also, letters: B, E, G, I, N -> avoid C,R,A? Yes.

Is ""BEGIN"" a valid guess? Yes, common word.

The secret word does not have duplicates? We don't know, so it should be okay.

Alternatively, ""ENDOW"": E,N,D,O,W
Positions:
1: E -> E at position1? New.
2: N -> N at position2? New.
3: D
4: O
5: W? But E and N are both moved? But the word must be valid? ""ENDOW"" is valid.

We might want to prioritize high-frequency letters? For example, test T or S? Because we haven't tested T or S yet.

In our first guess ""crane"", we tested: C (x), R (x), A (x), N (-), E (-) -> so we haven't tested T, S, O, I, L, etc.

So including T or S might be helpful.

Thus, perhaps ""STOEN""? Not a word.

""SONET""? Not common.

""STINE""? Not very common.

How about ""STEIN"": S,T,E,I,N
Positions:
1: S
2: T
3: E -> E at position3? Previously E was at position5? So avoid 5? Now position3? New.
4: I
5: N -> N at position5? Previously N was at position4? So avoid 4? Now position5? New.

This word is valid? Yes, ""STEIN"" is acceptable (as in beer mug or a surname).

This way, we are testing two new positions for E and N, and we are introducing S, T, I.

We avoid C,R,A.

Alternatively, ""SPINE"": S,P,I,N,E -> N at position4? But that is the same as before? We know N is not at position4? So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be '-'? So that's not new information? Actually, if we put N at position4 and it was already known to not be there, it will be marked as '-', but we already know it's in the word? So we don't learn anything new? So we should avoid position4 for N.

In ""SPINE"", N is at position4? So that's redundant? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate: 
- S, T, E, I, N
- E at position3? Previously E was at position5? Which we know is wrong? We try position3? Which might be correct? Or wrong? Let's see.
- N at position5? Previously at position4 (wrong)? Now at position5? That's a new position.

Similarly, we test S, T, I.

Another alternative: maybe we try to cover more vowels? In ""STEIN"", we have E and I? That's good.

So I'll go with ""STEIN"".

Therefore, guess: STEIN

But note: in the feedback we know E is present, and we are moving it? Same with N.

Alternatively, ""BEING"": B,E,I,N,G -> but E at position2? and N at position4? But position4 for N we already know? So avoid? 

Because N at position4? We know it's not at position4? So we expect it to be marked as '-', but we already know that? So no new information? So inefficient.

Therefore, better to move N to a new position? So in ""STEIN"", N is at position5? That's a new position? So we get new information? Yes? Because if the secret word has N at position5, then we get ✓? Or if not, but still present? Then it will be '-'? Which tells us it's in the word but position5 is also wrong? Then we know not to put N at position4 nor position5? Then we have fewer positions? So we learn.

Similarly for E at position3? We know E is present? But if we put E at position3 and it's correct? We get ✓? Or if not, then '-'? Then we know it's not at position3? So we learn a new wrong position? And that is helpful.

So indeed, we learn about the positions.

Therefore, let's use ""STEIN"".

<guess>stein</guess>### Thought Process

After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-), I inferred the following:
- **C, R, A are absent** from the secret word. This means any new guess must avoid these letters.
- **N is present but not in position 4** (since it was marked as wrong position in ""crane""). 
- **E is present but not in position 5** (marked as wrong position in ""crane""). 

The goal of the second guess is to:
1. Test N and E in new positions (avoiding position 4 for N and position 5 for E) to gather more information about their correct locations.
2. Introduce new common letters to maximize learning, focusing on untested consonants (like S, T, I) and vowels (like O or U), since A is ruled out.
  
After considering words that fit these criteria:
- Avoid words placing N at position 4 or E at position 5, as this would waste a guess by confirming known information.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., S, T, I) to increase the chance of hits.
- Ensure the word is valid and avoids C, R, A.

I evaluated several options:
- ""BEGIN"" (B,E,G,I,N) tests E at position 2 and N at position 5, but it misses common letters like S or T.
- ""UNITE"" (U,N,I,T,E) places E at position 5 (avoids this), so discarded.
- ""HONEY"" (H,O,N,E,Y) tests N at position 3 and E at position 4, but includes less common letters like Y.
- ""STEIN"" (S,T,E,I,N) emerged as a strong candidate because:
  - It tests E at position 3 (a new position, avoiding position 5).
  - It tests N at position 5 (a new position, avoiding position 4).
  - It introduces new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I (vowels not ruled out yet).
  - It avoids C, R, A entirely.
  
""STEIN"" is a valid English word and provides optimal position testing for E and N while maximizing coverage of untested letters.

### Guess

<guess>stein</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are absent from the word.
- N is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).
- E is present but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).

Guess 2: ""stein"" -> S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)
Meaning:
- S and T are absent from the word.
- E is present but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in ""stein"" and marked as wrong position).
- I is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""stein"" and marked as wrong position).
- N is present and in the correct position: position 5 (since it was in position 5 in ""stein"" and marked as correct).

So, from both feedbacks, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T
Present letters: N (correctly placed at position 5), E (present but not in position 3 or 5), I (present but not in position 4)

Also, note that E was also not in position 5 from the first guess, so E is not in position 3 or 5. Similarly, N is fixed at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 5: N (fixed)
- The letter E is in the word, but not in positions 3 or 5. So it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 4. So it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we have 5 letters, so we need to find two more letters.

We know the word has at least E, I, and N (with N at the end).

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T.
- Includes E (in a position that is not 3 or 5, so 1, 2, or 4) and I (in a position that is not 4, so 1, 2, or 3).
- Since N is fixed at position 5, we don't need to move it.

We also want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

Common letters we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

But note: we have two positions to fill (besides the known N at the end) and we have to place E and I in the remaining positions? Actually, the word has 5 positions. We know position 5 is N. So positions 1,2,3,4 are to be filled with E, I, and two other letters? Or possibly E and I are two of them, and we need two more? But we don't know if there are duplicates? However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far? But we can't rule out duplicates? But let's assume no duplicates for now? Because if there were duplicates, the feedback might have shown? But not necessarily? For example, if a letter appears twice, the feedback might show both? But in this case, we don't have any duplicate feedback? So we proceed with the assumption of no duplicates? But we should be cautious.

So the word has: 
- Position 5: N
- E is in one of positions 1,2,4? (but not 3 or 5)
- I is in one of positions 1,2,3? (but not 4)

But note: positions 1 and 2 are common for both E and I? So they could be in the same position? No, because each position can have only one letter? So we have to assign E and I to different positions? And then two more letters? But we have only 4 positions? Positions 1,2,3,4? And we have to place E and I in two of them? And then two other letters? But we have 5 letters? Position 5 is fixed? So we have 4 positions? And we have two known letters (E and I) to place? So we need two more unknown letters? Yes.

But we also have to consider that E and I might be in the word only once? So we have to assign E to one of {1,2,4} and I to one of {1,2,3}? But they can't be in the same position? So the possible positions for E and I are:

- If E is at 1, then I can be at 2 or 3.
- If E is at 2, then I can be at 1 or 3.
- If E is at 4, then I can be at 1,2, or 3.

But we also have two more letters to place? So we have to fill the remaining two positions with new letters? And we have to avoid C,R,A,S,T.

So for the next guess, we want to:
- Place E in one of the positions 1,2,4? But we don't know which? So we can choose one? And similarly for I? But we want to maximize information? So we might choose a word that tests E and I in positions that are likely? Or we can choose a word that tests new letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities? But we have to pick one word.

We can also try to use a word that has E and I in positions that we haven't ruled out? And also includes two new common letters.

For example, let's try to put E at position 4? Because in the first guess, E was at 5? Then in the second guess, E was at 3? So we haven't tested position 4 for E? And we haven't tested positions 1 and 2? But we can test position 4 for E? And for I, we can test position 1? Or 2? Or 3? But we already tested I at position 4? Which was wrong? So we can test I at position 1? Or 2? Or 3? We haven't tested any of these? So we can choose.

But note: if we put E at position 4? Then we can test if E is at position 4? If it is, we get a ✓? If not, we get a '-'? But if we get a '-', then we know E is not at position 4? Then it must be at 1 or 2? Similarly, we can test I at a new position.

But we also want to test new letters? So let's form a word.

For example, let's put E at position 4? Then we need to put I at one of 1,2,3? And then two new letters? And N at 5.

So the word: _ _ _ E N

We need to fill the first three positions? But one of them must be I? And the other two are new letters? And we avoid C,R,A,S,T.

So possible words? 

We can try: 
- Position 1: I? Then position 2 and 3: new letters? But I at position1? We haven't tested that? So we can try? Then the word: I ? ? E N

What words? Like ""IDIOM""? But that has D and M? But also O? And it's 5 letters? ""IDIOM"" has two I's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we have I already? So if we put I at position1? Then we have I at position1 and also in the word? But we don't know if the word has two I's? So it might be? But let's avoid duplicates for now? Because we haven't seen any? So we assume no duplicates? Then we cannot have two I's? So we cannot use ""IDIOM"" because it has two I's? Actually, ""IDIOM"" has I at position1 and position4? But position4 is E? So not? ""IDIOM"" is I,D,I,O,M? So two I's? So we avoid? Because we are assuming no duplicates? So we want a word with distinct letters? But the rules don't require distinct? But to avoid complexity, we can try to use distinct letters? But if we use a duplicate, we might get feedback that tells us? But for now, let's try to avoid? Because we have limited guesses? So we try to use distinct letters.

So for the word: I ? ? E N, with distinct letters? And ? are not C,R,A,S,T? And not E or I? Because E is at position4? And I at position1? So the middle two are new? And distinct? And not E or I? And not C,R,A,S,T.

So possible words: 
- ""ITEM""? But T is absent? We know T is absent? So cannot use T? 
- ""IDIOM"" has duplicate I? And T? Not? 
- ""IMAGE""? But M,A? A is absent? 
- ""INLET""? But N is at position5? And we have I at position1? Then L,E? But E is at position4? So ""INLET"" is I,N,L,E,T? But T is absent? And N is at position2? But we already have N at position5? And we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot have two N's? So avoid? 
- ""ICED""? Only 4 letters? 
- ""IDLER""? But R is absent? 
- ""IGLOO""? But duplicate O? And O? But also L? But ""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O? Duplicate O? And 5 letters? But we have E? We need E at position4? So not? 

Alternatively, put E at position4? And I at position2? Then the word: ? I ? E N

So positions: 1: new letter, 2: I, 3: new letter, 4: E, 5: N

Then the word: _ I _ E N

Possible words: 
- ""WIDEN"": W,I,D,E,N -> letters: W, I, D, E, N? Avoid C,R,A,S,T? Yes? And distinct? Yes? 
- ""GIVEN"": G,I,V,E,N? Avoid C,R,A,S,T? Yes? 
- ""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? 
- ""MIXEN""? Not common? 
- ""PIXEL""? But E at position4? But L at position5? But we need N at position5? So not? 
- ""WIDEN"", ""GIVEN"", ""LIVEN"" are options.

But we have to choose one? We can test two new letters? For example, in ""WIDEN"": we test W and D? 
In ""GIVEN"": G and V? 
In ""LIVEN"": L and V? 

Common letters: D, G, L, V, W? D and L are more common? 

But we also want to test the positions? We are putting E at position4? And I at position2? 

If we choose ""WIDEN"", we test:
- Position1: W? If it's present? 
- Position2: I? We know I is present? But we are testing position2? If I is at position2, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? 
- Position3: D? 
- Position4: E? We are testing if E is at position4? 
- Position5: N (already correct? So we get ✓? But we know that? So it will be marked ✓? 

Similarly for others.

But note: we are testing two things: 
1. Is E at position4? 
2. Is I at position2? 
3. And we test two new letters: for ""WIDEN"", we test W and D? 

If we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? If not, then E must be at position1 or 2? But if we put I at position2? Then if E is at position2? But we are putting I at position2? Then E cannot be at position2? Because one letter per position? So if we put I at position2, then E cannot be at position2? So if E is not at position4? Then it must be at position1? Because positions 3 and 5 are ruled out? And position2 is taken by I? 

Similarly, if we put I at position2? Then if I is not at position2? We get '-'? Then I must be at position1 or 3? 

But we are also testing new letters? 

Alternatively, we can put E at position1? Then the word: E ? ? ? N? And we need to put I at one of 2,3? And two new letters? 

But we haven't tested position1 for E? So we can try? 

For example: E ? ? ? N? With I at position2 or 3? 

But we have to fill? 

But let's see? We have more flexibility? 

But we have to choose one? 

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has both E and I? And also includes two common letters? And we choose positions that are not ruled out? 

But we have to avoid the absent letters? 

Let me list the possible positions for E and I? 

E: positions 1,2,4? (avoid 3,5)
I: positions 1,2,3? (avoid 4)

But they cannot be in the same position? 

So the possible pairs (E position, I position):
- (1,2): E at 1, I at 2
- (1,3): E at 1, I at 3
- (2,1): E at 2, I at 1
- (2,3): E at 2, I at 3
- (4,1): E at 4, I at 1
- (4,2): E at 4, I at 2
- (4,3): E at 4, I at 3

We have 7 possibilities? But we don't know which? 

We can try to choose a word that tests one of these? And also tests new letters? 

But we have to pick one? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests E at position4? And I at position1? For example? Then we can rule out or confirm? 

So let's try ""GIVEN"": G,I,V,E,N? 
- Position1: G
- Position2: I
- Position3: V
- Position4: E
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position4? 
- I at position2? 
- And new letters G and V? 

But we also test position2 for I? 

If we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? If not, then E must be at position1 or 2? But if I is at position2? Then E cannot be at position2? So if E is not at position4? Then E must be at position1? 

Similarly, if I is at position2? Then we get ✓? If not, then I must be at position1 or 3? 

So we get information? 

Similarly, we test G and V? 

But we can also choose ""WIDEN"": W,I,D,E,N? Same structure? 

But which one? 

""GIVEN"" has G and V? V is less common? W is also less common? 

""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? L is common? 

But we have another option: ""DIVEN""? Not a word? 

""PIXEN""? Not common? 

""BIKED""? But E at position4? But D? And B? But ""BIKED"" is B,I,K,E,D? But we need N at position5? Not? 

So the options are limited? 

Another word: ""OILED""? But E at position5? But we need E at position4? And N at position5? Not? 

""MINED"": M,I,N,E,D? But N at position3? But we have N at position5? And we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot have two N's? So avoid? 

So back to ""WIDEN"", ""GIVEN"", ""LIVEN""? 

I think ""GIVEN"" is a good word? Because G and V are not tested? 

But let's see the frequency? 

Alternatively, we can try to test E at position1? 

For example, ""EXIST""? But S and T are absent? 

""EDWIN""? Not common? 

""ELOIN"": E,L,O,I,N? 
- Position1: E
- Position2: L
- Position3: O
- Position4: I? But we know I is not at position4? Because in guess2, I was at position4 and marked as wrong position? So we cannot put I at position4? 

So avoid? 

""EIGHT"": But T absent? 

""ENVOY"": E,N,V,O,Y? But N at position2? But we have N at position5? Duplicate? Avoid? 

So it's hard to put E at position1? 

Similarly, put E at position2? 

For example, ""LEVIN""? L,E,V,I,N? 
- Position1: L
- Position2: E
- Position3: V
- Position4: I? But I cannot be at position4? Because we know I is not at position4? 

So avoid? 

""BEIGE""? But not 5 letters? And no N? 

""DEIGN"": D,E,I,G,N? 
- Position1: D
- Position2: E
- Position3: I
- Position4: G
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position2? 
- I at position3? 
- New letters D and G? 

And avoids C,R,A,S,T? 

Also, positions: 
- E at position2? We haven't tested that? 
- I at position3? We haven't tested that? 

So this is also a good candidate? 

""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to think or consider? 

So we have two options: 
- ""GIVEN"": tests E at position4 and I at position2? 
- ""DEIGN"": tests E at position2 and I at position3? 

Which one to choose? 

We can choose based on letter frequency? 

But also, we want to cover the positions that are more likely? 

In English, for words ending with N, common patterns? 

But let's see: 

In ""DEIGN"", we test E at position2 and I at position3? 

In ""GIVEN"", we test E at position4 and I at position2? 

But we know that E was not at position5 or 3? So position2 and 4 are possible? Similarly, I was not at position4? So position1,2,3 are possible? 

Both are valid? 

But in ""DEIGN"", we test two new positions: E at position2 and I at position3? 

In ""GIVEN"", we test E at position4 and I at position2? 

We have to choose one? 

I think ""DEIGN"" is a good choice? Because it tests two new positions? And D and G are common? 

But let's see the feedback? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests E at position1? But we couldn't find a good one? 

Another word: ""OWING""? But O,W,I,N,G? But E is missing? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? 

So we must include E? 

So ""DEIGN"" includes E? 

Similarly, ""GIVEN"" includes E? 

I think I'll go with ""DEIGN""? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

If we choose ""DEIGN"": 
- If E is at position2, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? 
- If I is at position3, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? 
- We test D and G? 

Similarly for ""GIVEN""? 

But in ""GIVEN"", if we put I at position2? And if I is not at position2? Then we get '-'? And we know I must be at position1 or 3? 

But in ""DEIGN"", we test I at position3? 

I think both are fine? 

But let's choose ""DEIGN"" because it tests position3 for I? Which we haven't tested? 

So guess: DEIGN

But note: we have to write it in the format? 

But let's confirm the word: D-E-I-G-N

Yes.

So <guess>deign</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
  - **C, R, A are absent** from the secret word.  
  - **N is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(✓)  
  - **S and T are absent** from the secret word.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 3 (and not in position 5, from Guess 1).  
  - **I is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **N is correct and in position 5** (so position 5 is fixed as **N**).  

### Key Insights
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T (cannot be used).  
- **Present letters**:  
  - **N**: Correctly placed at position 5.  
  - **E**: Present but not in positions 3 or 5. Must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
  - **I**: Present but not in position 4. Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
- **Word structure**:  
  - Position 5 is fixed as **N**.  
  - E and I must be placed in the remaining positions (1–4), but not in their invalid positions (E not in 3/5, I not in 4).  
  - Two additional unknown letters are needed to fill positions 1–4 (alongside E and I).  
- **Strategy for next guess**:  
  - Test E and I in new positions to narrow down their locations.  
  - Introduce new common letters (avoiding absent letters: C, R, A, S, T).  
  - Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., D, G, L, M) and vowels (O, U) not yet tested.  
  - Avoid duplicate letters for now (no duplicates indicated in feedback).  

### Choosing the Next Guess: ""DEIGN""
After evaluating options, **""DEIGN""** (D-E-I-G-N) is selected because:  
- **Tests E at position 2**: We know E is not in positions 3 or 5, so position 2 is a new, plausible location.  
- **Tests I at position 3**: We know I is not in position 4, so position 3 is a new, plausible location.  
- **Introduces new common letters**: D and G (high-frequency consonants not ruled out).  
- **Fits the fixed N at position 5**: Confirms the known correct letter/position.  
- **Avoids absent letters**: No C, R, A, S, T.  
- **Valid English word**: ""Deign"" means to do something reluctantly.  

### Expected Outcomes
- If E is in position 2, it will be marked ✓; otherwise, it will be marked - (wrong position).  
- If I is in position 3, it will be marked ✓; otherwise, it will be marked - (wrong position).  
- Feedback on D (position 1) and G (position 4) will reveal if they are in the word (and if so, their positions).  

This guess efficiently narrows down the positions for E and I while testing two new letters.

But wait, E is at the end? Actually, positions 1,2,3,4,5 but we know not at the original spots.\n\nHowever, we can try to put them in different positions.\n\nWe also know that the word does not have C, R, A, so we avoid those.\n\nCommon consonants and vowels: we have E already (a vowel) so we might need more vowels? Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. But we know A is out. So vowels available: E (we already have), and we can try I, O, U.\n\nBut we have only one E? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicates, but typically in Wordle, each letter is considered individually. If there are duplicates, it might be tricky, but we don\'t know.\n\nGiven that, let\'s think of a word that:\n- Does not contain C, R, A.\n- Contains N and E, but not at the same positions as before (so not position 4 for N, not position 5 for E).\n- Also, we want to test other common letters.\n\nWe can put N and E in different positions and add other letters that are common.\n\nWhat are other common letters? Consider: T, S, L, I, O, U, etc.\n\nFor example, we can try to put E in a position other than 5, and N in a position other than 4.\n\nLet me consider positions:\n\nPossible words: \n- Option: Have E at the beginning? But then might conflict. Or in the middle.\n\nWe need to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nAnother good starting word might be to test more vowels and common consonants.\n\nBut we already have two vowels ruled out: A is out, and E is present. So we need at least another vowel? Typically, English words have vowels like E, and then one of I, O, U.\n\nSo let\'s try a word with E, N, and then new letters.\n\nExample words:\n\nWe know E is present: so we can try E at position 1? But if we put E at the beginning, and it\'s correct then we get a check. Similarly, move N around.\n\nWhat about ""LINEN""? But let\'s check: it has L, I, N, E, N. But note: possibly duplicate N? Also, does it avoid C, R, A? Yes.\n\nBut wait, the word must be 5 distinct letters? No, duplicates are allowed. So let\'s see the positions in ""LINEN"": \nPosition1: L\nPosition2: I\nPosition3: N\nPosition4: E\nPosition5: N\n\nNow, in our feedback, in the first guess we had N at position 4 marked as \'-\' (present but wrong position) and E at position 5 marked as \'-\' (present but wrong position).\n\nIn this word, we have:\n- Position3: N\n- Position4: E -> but in our first guess, E was at position5. Now we are putting E at position4? So if the secret word has E at position4, then it would be correct? But we don\'t know.\nSimilarly, N at position3 and also at position5.\n\nBut we also are introducing new letters: L and I.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s avoid duplicate N for now? Since we don\'t know if there are duplicates.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that uses common letters and avoids C, R, A.\n\nLet me list common letters without C, R, A: E, S, T, L, I, O, N, etc.\n\nSo a good candidate might be ""STONE"": \n- S, T, O, N, E\n\nThis has:\n- S at position1\n- T at position2\n- O at position3\n- N at position4 -> but wait, in first guess we had N at position4 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning N is present but not at position4. So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be wrong? Because we know it\'s not at position4. So that would be redundant.\n\nSo avoid putting N at position4 again.\n\nSimilarly, avoid putting E at position5.\n\nIn ""STONE"", N is at position4 (same as before) and E at position5 (same as before). So we would likely get the same feedback for those positions? So not helpful.\n\nThus, we might choose a word that moves N and E to other positions.\n\nHow about ""HONEY""? \n- H, O, N, E, Y\n\nPositions:\n1: H\n2: O\n3: N -> now we put N at position3 (previously it was at position4, which is wrong)\n4: E -> now E at position4 (previously it was at position5, which was wrong)\n5: Y\n\nSo we are testing N at position3 and E at position4, which are new positions.\n\nAlso, we introduce H, O, Y.\n\nBut the word must be a valid English word. ""HONEY"" is valid.\n\nAlternatively, ""NOISE"": N,O,I,S,E\nPositions:\n1: N -> testing N at position1\n2: O\n3: I\n4: S\n5: E -> testing E at position5 again? We know E is not at position5 because in the first guess it was marked as wrong position. So if we put E at position5 again, we know it will be marked \'-\' again? So that doesn\'t give new information.\n\nTo maximize new information, avoid the positions we know are wrong.\n\nSo avoid:\n- position4 for N (since we already know N is not at position4)\n- position5 for E (since we know E is not at position5)\n\nThus, for the next guess, we should put N in positions 1,2,3 or 5? But position5 is currently occupied by E? Not necessarily.\n\nWe can assign:\n- N: try positions 1,2,3,5? (avoid 4)\n- E: try positions 1,2,3,4? (avoid 5)\n\nSo we have flexibility.\n\nLet me try to form a word that has N at a position that is not 4 and E at a position that is not 5, and includes other common letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""UNITE"": U,N,I,T,E\nPositions: \n1: U\n2: N -> N at position2? That\'s new.\n3: I\n4: T\n5: E -> but position5 is the same? We know E is not at 5? So if we put E at position5, we will get \'-\' again? And we know that already.\n\nSo we want to avoid E at position5? Yes.\n\nTherefore, only positions 1,2,3,4 for E.\n\nSo in ""UNITE"", E is at position5? So avoid that.\n\nAnother try: ""BEGIN"": B,E,G,I,N\nPositions:\n1: B\n2: E -> E at position2? That\'s new? Previously E was at position5.\n3: G\n4: I\n5: N -> N at position5? That\'s new? Previously N was at position4.\n\nThis avoids the known wrong positions: \n- E not at position5? Now at position2? Which is new.\n- N not at position4? Now at position5? Which is new.\n\nAlso, letters: B, E, G, I, N -> avoid C,R,A? Yes.\n\nIs ""BEGIN"" a valid guess? Yes, common word.\n\nThe secret word does not have duplicates? We don\'t know, so it should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, ""ENDOW"": E,N,D,O,W\nPositions:\n1: E -> E at position1? New.\n2: N -> N at position2? New.\n3: D\n4: O\n5: W? But E and N are both moved? But the word must be valid? ""ENDOW"" is valid.\n\nWe might want to prioritize high-frequency letters? For example, test T or S? Because we haven\'t tested T or S yet.\n\nIn our first guess ""crane"", we tested: C (x), R (x), A (x), N (-), E (-) -> so we haven\'t tested T, S, O, I, L, etc.\n\nSo including T or S might be helpful.\n\nThus, perhaps ""STOEN""? Not a word.\n\n""SONET""? Not common.\n\n""STINE""? Not very common.\n\nHow about ""STEIN"": S,T,E,I,N\nPositions:\n1: S\n2: T\n3: E -> E at position3? Previously E was at position5? So avoid 5? Now position3? New.\n4: I\n5: N -> N at position5? Previously N was at position4? So avoid 4? Now position5? New.\n\nThis word is valid? Yes, ""STEIN"" is acceptable (as in beer mug or a surname).\n\nThis way, we are testing two new positions for E and N, and we are introducing S, T, I.\n\nWe avoid C,R,A.\n\nAlternatively, ""SPINE"": S,P,I,N,E -> N at position4? But that is the same as before? We know N is not at position4? So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be \'-\'? So that\'s not new information? Actually, if we put N at position4 and it was already known to not be there, it will be marked as \'-\', but we already know it\'s in the word? So we don\'t learn anything new? So we should avoid position4 for N.\n\nIn ""SPINE"", N is at position4? So that\'s redundant? Yes.\n\nTherefore, I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate: \n- S, T, E, I, N\n- E at position3? Previously E was at position5? Which we know is wrong? We try position3? Which might be correct? Or wrong? Let\'s see.\n- N at position5? Previously at position4 (wrong)? Now at position5? That\'s a new position.\n\nSimilarly, we test S, T, I.\n\nAnother alternative: maybe we try to cover more vowels? In ""STEIN"", we have E and I? That\'s good.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STEIN"".\n\nTherefore, guess: STEIN\n\nBut note: in the feedback we know E is present, and we are moving it? Same with N.\n\nAlternatively, ""BEING"": B,E,I,N,G -> but E at position2? and N at position4? But position4 for N we already know? So avoid? \n\nBecause N at position4? We know it\'s not at position4? So we expect it to be marked as \'-\', but we already know that? So no new information? So inefficient.\n\nTherefore, better to move N to a new position? So in ""STEIN"", N is at position5? That\'s a new position? So we get new information? Yes? Because if the secret word has N at position5, then we get ✓? Or if not, but still present? Then it will be \'-\'? Which tells us it\'s in the word but position5 is also wrong? Then we know not to put N at position4 nor position5? Then we have fewer positions? So we learn.\n\nSimilarly for E at position3? We know E is present? But if we put E at position3 and it\'s correct? We get ✓? Or if not, then \'-\'? Then we know it\'s not at position3? So we learn a new wrong position? And that is helpful.\n\nSo indeed, we learn about the positions.\n\nTherefore, let\'s use ""STEIN"".\n\n<guess>stein</guess>### Thought Process\n\nAfter reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-), I inferred the following:\n- **C, R, A are absent** from the secret word. This means any new guess must avoid these letters.\n- **N is present but not in position 4** (since it was marked as wrong position in ""crane""). \n- **E is present but not in position 5** (marked as wrong position in ""crane""). \n\nThe goal of the second guess is to:\n1. Test N and E in new positions (avoiding position 4 for N and position 5 for E) to gather more information about their correct locations.\n2. Introduce new common letters to maximize learning, focusing on untested consonants (like S, T, I) and vowels (like O or U), since A is ruled out.\n  \nAfter considering words that fit these criteria:\n- Avoid words placing N at position 4 or E at position 5, as this would waste a guess by confirming known information.\n- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., S, T, I) to increase the chance of hits.\n- Ensure the word is valid and avoids C, R, A.\n\nI evaluated several options:\n- ""BEGIN"" (B,E,G,I,N) tests E at position 2 and N at position 5, but it misses common letters like S or T.\n- ""UNITE"" (U,N,I,T,E) places E at position 5 (avoids this), so discarded.\n- ""HONEY"" (H,O,N,E,Y) tests N at position 3 and E at position 4, but includes less common letters like Y.\n- ""STEIN"" (S,T,E,I,N) emerged as a strong candidate because:\n  - It tests E at position 3 (a new position, avoiding position 5).\n  - It tests N at position 5 (a new position, avoiding position 4).\n  - It introduces new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I (vowels not ruled out yet).\n  - It avoids C, R, A entirely.\n  \n""STEIN"" is a valid English word and provides optimal position testing for E and N while maximizing coverage of untested letters.\n\n### Guess\n\n<guess>stein</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A are absent from the word.\n- N is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).\n- E is present but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).\n\nGuess 2: ""stein"" -> S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)\nMeaning:\n- S and T are absent from the word.\n- E is present but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in ""stein"" and marked as wrong position).\n- I is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""stein"" and marked as wrong position).\n- N is present and in the correct position: position 5 (since it was in position 5 in ""stein"" and marked as correct).\n\nSo, from both feedbacks, we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, S, T\nPresent letters: N (correctly placed at position 5), E (present but not in position 3 or 5), I (present but not in position 4)\n\nAlso, note that E was also not in position 5 from the first guess, so E is not in position 3 or 5. Similarly, N is fixed at position 5.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Position 5: N (fixed)\n- The letter E is in the word, but not in positions 3 or 5. So it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 4. So it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nAlso, we have 5 letters, so we need to find two more letters.\n\nWe know the word has at least E, I, and N (with N at the end).\n\nNow, we need to form a new guess that:\n- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T.\n- Includes E (in a position that is not 3 or 5, so 1, 2, or 4) and I (in a position that is not 4, so 1, 2, or 3).\n- Since N is fixed at position 5, we don\'t need to move it.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nBut note: we have two positions to fill (besides the known N at the end) and we have to place E and I in the remaining positions? Actually, the word has 5 positions. We know position 5 is N. So positions 1,2,3,4 are to be filled with E, I, and two other letters? Or possibly E and I are two of them, and we need two more? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates? However, we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback so far? But we can\'t rule out duplicates? But let\'s assume no duplicates for now? Because if there were duplicates, the feedback might have shown? But not necessarily? For example, if a letter appears twice, the feedback might show both? But in this case, we don\'t have any duplicate feedback? So we proceed with the assumption of no duplicates? But we should be cautious.\n\nSo the word has: \n- Position 5: N\n- E is in one of positions 1,2,4? (but not 3 or 5)\n- I is in one of positions 1,2,3? (but not 4)\n\nBut note: positions 1 and 2 are common for both E and I? So they could be in the same position? No, because each position can have only one letter? So we have to assign E and I to different positions? And then two more letters? But we have only 4 positions? Positions 1,2,3,4? And we have to place E and I in two of them? And then two other letters? But we have 5 letters? Position 5 is fixed? So we have 4 positions? And we have two known letters (E and I) to place? So we need two more unknown letters? Yes.\n\nBut we also have to consider that E and I might be in the word only once? So we have to assign E to one of {1,2,4} and I to one of {1,2,3}? But they can\'t be in the same position? So the possible positions for E and I are:\n\n- If E is at 1, then I can be at 2 or 3.\n- If E is at 2, then I can be at 1 or 3.\n- If E is at 4, then I can be at 1,2, or 3.\n\nBut we also have two more letters to place? So we have to fill the remaining two positions with new letters? And we have to avoid C,R,A,S,T.\n\nSo for the next guess, we want to:\n- Place E in one of the positions 1,2,4? But we don\'t know which? So we can choose one? And similarly for I? But we want to maximize information? So we might choose a word that tests E and I in positions that are likely? Or we can choose a word that tests new letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities? But we have to pick one word.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has E and I in positions that we haven\'t ruled out? And also includes two new common letters.\n\nFor example, let\'s try to put E at position 4? Because in the first guess, E was at 5? Then in the second guess, E was at 3? So we haven\'t tested position 4 for E? And we haven\'t tested positions 1 and 2? But we can test position 4 for E? And for I, we can test position 1? Or 2? Or 3? But we already tested I at position 4? Which was wrong? So we can test I at position 1? Or 2? Or 3? We haven\'t tested any of these? So we can choose.\n\nBut note: if we put E at position 4? Then we can test if E is at position 4? If it is, we get a ✓? If not, we get a \'-\'? But if we get a \'-\', then we know E is not at position 4? Then it must be at 1 or 2? Similarly, we can test I at a new position.\n\nBut we also want to test new letters? So let\'s form a word.\n\nFor example, let\'s put E at position 4? Then we need to put I at one of 1,2,3? And then two new letters? And N at 5.\n\nSo the word: _ _ _ E N\n\nWe need to fill the first three positions? But one of them must be I? And the other two are new letters? And we avoid C,R,A,S,T.\n\nSo possible words? \n\nWe can try: \n- Position 1: I? Then position 2 and 3: new letters? But I at position1? We haven\'t tested that? So we can try? Then the word: I ? ? E N\n\nWhat words? Like ""IDIOM""? But that has D and M? But also O? And it\'s 5 letters? ""IDIOM"" has two I\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But we have I already? So if we put I at position1? Then we have I at position1 and also in the word? But we don\'t know if the word has two I\'s? So it might be? But let\'s avoid duplicates for now? Because we haven\'t seen any? So we assume no duplicates? Then we cannot have two I\'s? So we cannot use ""IDIOM"" because it has two I\'s? Actually, ""IDIOM"" has I at position1 and position4? But position4 is E? So not? ""IDIOM"" is I,D,I,O,M? So two I\'s? So we avoid? Because we are assuming no duplicates? So we want a word with distinct letters? But the rules don\'t require distinct? But to avoid complexity, we can try to use distinct letters? But if we use a duplicate, we might get feedback that tells us? But for now, let\'s try to avoid? Because we have limited guesses? So we try to use distinct letters.\n\nSo for the word: I ? ? E N, with distinct letters? And ? are not C,R,A,S,T? And not E or I? Because E is at position4? And I at position1? So the middle two are new? And distinct? And not E or I? And not C,R,A,S,T.\n\nSo possible words: \n- ""ITEM""? But T is absent? We know T is absent? So cannot use T? \n- ""IDIOM"" has duplicate I? And T? Not? \n- ""IMAGE""? But M,A? A is absent? \n- ""INLET""? But N is at position5? And we have I at position1? Then L,E? But E is at position4? So ""INLET"" is I,N,L,E,T? But T is absent? And N is at position2? But we already have N at position5? And we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot have two N\'s? So avoid? \n- ""ICED""? Only 4 letters? \n- ""IDLER""? But R is absent? \n- ""IGLOO""? But duplicate O? And O? But also L? But ""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O? Duplicate O? And 5 letters? But we have E? We need E at position4? So not? \n\nAlternatively, put E at position4? And I at position2? Then the word: ? I ? E N\n\nSo positions: 1: new letter, 2: I, 3: new letter, 4: E, 5: N\n\nThen the word: _ I _ E N\n\nPossible words: \n- ""WIDEN"": W,I,D,E,N -> letters: W, I, D, E, N? Avoid C,R,A,S,T? Yes? And distinct? Yes? \n- ""GIVEN"": G,I,V,E,N? Avoid C,R,A,S,T? Yes? \n- ""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? \n- ""MIXEN""? Not common? \n- ""PIXEL""? But E at position4? But L at position5? But we need N at position5? So not? \n- ""WIDEN"", ""GIVEN"", ""LIVEN"" are options.\n\nBut we have to choose one? We can test two new letters? For example, in ""WIDEN"": we test W and D? \nIn ""GIVEN"": G and V? \nIn ""LIVEN"": L and V? \n\nCommon letters: D, G, L, V, W? D and L are more common? \n\nBut we also want to test the positions? We are putting E at position4? And I at position2? \n\nIf we choose ""WIDEN"", we test:\n- Position1: W? If it\'s present? \n- Position2: I? We know I is present? But we are testing position2? If I is at position2, we get ✓? If not, we get \'-\'? \n- Position3: D? \n- Position4: E? We are testing if E is at position4? \n- Position5: N (already correct? So we get ✓? But we know that? So it will be marked ✓? \n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut note: we are testing two things: \n1. Is E at position4? \n2. Is I at position2? \n3. And we test two new letters: for ""WIDEN"", we test W and D? \n\nIf we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? If not, then E must be at position1 or 2? But if we put I at position2? Then if E is at position2? But we are putting I at position2? Then E cannot be at position2? Because one letter per position? So if we put I at position2, then E cannot be at position2? So if E is not at position4? Then it must be at position1? Because positions 3 and 5 are ruled out? And position2 is taken by I? \n\nSimilarly, if we put I at position2? Then if I is not at position2? We get \'-\'? Then I must be at position1 or 3? \n\nBut we are also testing new letters? \n\nAlternatively, we can put E at position1? Then the word: E ? ? ? N? And we need to put I at one of 2,3? And two new letters? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested position1 for E? So we can try? \n\nFor example: E ? ? ? N? With I at position2 or 3? \n\nBut we have to fill? \n\nBut let\'s see? We have more flexibility? \n\nBut we have to choose one? \n\nAnother idea: we can try to use a word that has both E and I? And also includes two common letters? And we choose positions that are not ruled out? \n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters? \n\nLet me list the possible positions for E and I? \n\nE: positions 1,2,4? (avoid 3,5)\nI: positions 1,2,3? (avoid 4)\n\nBut they cannot be in the same position? \n\nSo the possible pairs (E position, I position):\n- (1,2): E at 1, I at 2\n- (1,3): E at 1, I at 3\n- (2,1): E at 2, I at 1\n- (2,3): E at 2, I at 3\n- (4,1): E at 4, I at 1\n- (4,2): E at 4, I at 2\n- (4,3): E at 4, I at 3\n\nWe have 7 possibilities? But we don\'t know which? \n\nWe can try to choose a word that tests one of these? And also tests new letters? \n\nBut we have to pick one? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests E at position4? And I at position1? For example? Then we can rule out or confirm? \n\nSo let\'s try ""GIVEN"": G,I,V,E,N? \n- Position1: G\n- Position2: I\n- Position3: V\n- Position4: E\n- Position5: N\n\nThis tests:\n- E at position4? \n- I at position2? \n- And new letters G and V? \n\nBut we also test position2 for I? \n\nIf we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? If not, then E must be at position1 or 2? But if I is at position2? Then E cannot be at position2? So if E is not at position4? Then E must be at position1? \n\nSimilarly, if I is at position2? Then we get ✓? If not, then I must be at position1 or 3? \n\nSo we get information? \n\nSimilarly, we test G and V? \n\nBut we can also choose ""WIDEN"": W,I,D,E,N? Same structure? \n\nBut which one? \n\n""GIVEN"" has G and V? V is less common? W is also less common? \n\n""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? L is common? \n\nBut we have another option: ""DIVEN""? Not a word? \n\n""PIXEN""? Not common? \n\n""BIKED""? But E at position4? But D? And B? But ""BIKED"" is B,I,K,E,D? But we need N at position5? Not? \n\nSo the options are limited? \n\nAnother word: ""OILED""? But E at position5? But we need E at position4? And N at position5? Not? \n\n""MINED"": M,I,N,E,D? But N at position3? But we have N at position5? And we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot have two N\'s? So avoid? \n\nSo back to ""WIDEN"", ""GIVEN"", ""LIVEN""? \n\nI think ""GIVEN"" is a good word? Because G and V are not tested? \n\nBut let\'s see the frequency? \n\nAlternatively, we can try to test E at position1? \n\nFor example, ""EXIST""? But S and T are absent? \n\n""EDWIN""? Not common? \n\n""ELOIN"": E,L,O,I,N? \n- Position1: E\n- Position2: L\n- Position3: O\n- Position4: I? But we know I is not at position4? Because in guess2, I was at position4 and marked as wrong position? So we cannot put I at position4? \n\nSo avoid? \n\n""EIGHT"": But T absent? \n\n""ENVOY"": E,N,V,O,Y? But N at position2? But we have N at position5? Duplicate? Avoid? \n\nSo it\'s hard to put E at position1? \n\nSimilarly, put E at position2? \n\nFor example, ""LEVIN""? L,E,V,I,N? \n- Position1: L\n- Position2: E\n- Position3: V\n- Position4: I? But I cannot be at position4? Because we know I is not at position4? \n\nSo avoid? \n\n""BEIGE""? But not 5 letters? And no N? \n\n""DEIGN"": D,E,I,G,N? \n- Position1: D\n- Position2: E\n- Position3: I\n- Position4: G\n- Position5: N\n\nThis tests:\n- E at position2? \n- I at position3? \n- New letters D and G? \n\nAnd avoids C,R,A,S,T? \n\nAlso, positions: \n- E at position2? We haven\'t tested that? \n- I at position3? We haven\'t tested that? \n\nSo this is also a good candidate? \n\n""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to think or consider? \n\nSo we have two options: \n- ""GIVEN"": tests E at position4 and I at position2? \n- ""DEIGN"": tests E at position2 and I at position3? \n\nWhich one to choose? \n\nWe can choose based on letter frequency? \n\nBut also, we want to cover the positions that are more likely? \n\nIn English, for words ending with N, common patterns? \n\nBut let\'s see: \n\nIn ""DEIGN"", we test E at position2 and I at position3? \n\nIn ""GIVEN"", we test E at position4 and I at position2? \n\nBut we know that E was not at position5 or 3? So position2 and 4 are possible? Similarly, I was not at position4? So position1,2,3 are possible? \n\nBoth are valid? \n\nBut in ""DEIGN"", we test two new positions: E at position2 and I at position3? \n\nIn ""GIVEN"", we test E at position4 and I at position2? \n\nWe have to choose one? \n\nI think ""DEIGN"" is a good choice? Because it tests two new positions? And D and G are common? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests E at position1? But we couldn\'t find a good one? \n\nAnother word: ""OWING""? But O,W,I,N,G? But E is missing? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? \n\nSo we must include E? \n\nSo ""DEIGN"" includes E? \n\nSimilarly, ""GIVEN"" includes E? \n\nI think I\'ll go with ""DEIGN""? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get? \n\nIf we choose ""DEIGN"": \n- If E is at position2, we get ✓? If not, we get \'-\'? \n- If I is at position3, we get ✓? If not, we get \'-\'? \n- We test D and G? \n\nSimilarly for ""GIVEN""? \n\nBut in ""GIVEN"", if we put I at position2? And if I is not at position2? Then we get \'-\'? And we know I must be at position1 or 3? \n\nBut in ""DEIGN"", we test I at position3? \n\nI think both are fine? \n\nBut let\'s choose ""DEIGN"" because it tests position3 for I? Which we haven\'t tested? \n\nSo guess: DEIGN\n\nBut note: we have to write it in the format? \n\nBut let\'s confirm the word: D-E-I-G-N\n\nYes.\n\nSo <guess>deign</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  \n  - **C, R, A are absent** from the secret word.  \n  - **N is present** but not in position 4.  \n  - **E is present** but not in position 5.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(✓)  \n  - **S and T are absent** from the secret word.  \n  - **E is present** but not in position 3 (and not in position 5, from Guess 1).  \n  - **I is present** but not in position 4.  \n  - **N is correct and in position 5** (so position 5 is fixed as **N**).  \n\n### Key Insights\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T (cannot be used).  \n- **Present letters**:  \n  - **N**: Correctly placed at position 5.  \n  - **E**: Present but not in positions 3 or 5.

We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A are absent. N is present but not in position 4. E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""stein"" -> S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)
Meaning: S, T are absent. E is present but not in position 3. I is present but not in position 4. N is correct at position 5.

Guess 3: ""deign"" -> D(x) E(-) I(-) G(x) N(✓)
Meaning: D and G are absent. E is present but not in position 2 (since in ""deign"" E was at position 2 and marked as '-'). I is present but not in position 3 (since in ""deign"" I was at position 3 and marked as '-'). N is correct at position 5.

So, summarizing:

- Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, D, G
- Present letters: E, I, N (with N fixed at position 5)
- E is not in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from guesses: not 5 from guess1, not 3 from guess2, not 2 from guess3). Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 4.
- I is not in positions 3 or 4 (from guess2: not 4, from guess3: not 3). Therefore, I must be in position 1 or 2.

But note: E and I cannot be in the same position. So we have two cases:

Case 1: E at position 1, then I must be at position 2 (since I cannot be at 1 if E is there).
Case 2: E at position 4, then I can be at position 1 or 2.

But wait, if E is at position 4, then I can be at position 1 or 2? But we have to fill position 3 with a new letter? And we have two more letters? Actually, the word has 5 positions: 
Position 1: either E or I or a new letter? But we know E and I are present, so they must occupy two of the positions 1,2,3,4? And position 5 is N.

So the word has:
- Position 5: N
- E in {1,4}
- I in {1,2}

But if E is at 1, then I must be at 2 (since I cannot be at 1 and 2 is available). Then positions 3 and 4 must be filled with two new letters? But we have only two positions? And we have to avoid the absent letters.

If E is at 4, then I can be at 1 or 2? Then the other position (2 or 1) and position 3 must be filled with new letters? 

But we also know that we have two more letters to find? Because the word has 5 letters: we have E, I, N, and two more.

Now, from the feedback, we have used 7 absent letters: C,R,A,S,T,D,G. So we have many letters left? But we need to choose from the remaining.

Common letters left: B, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a word that:
- Has N at position 5.
- E at position 1 or 4.
- I at position 1 or 2? But if E is at 1, then I must be at 2? If E is at 4, then I can be at 1 or 2? 

But we don't know which case? So we need to test? 

We can try to choose a word that covers one of the cases? 

For example, let's assume E is at position 1? Then I must be at position 2? Then the word is: E I ? ? N

Then we need to fill positions 3 and 4 with two new letters? And avoid absent letters.

Possible words: 
- ""EIKON""? But K? And O? But ""EIKON"" is E,I,K,O,N? 
- ""EILEN""? But E and N are already? And L? But ""EILEN"" is not common? 
- ""EIGHT""? But T is absent? 
- ""EIDER"": E,I,D,E,R? But D and R are absent? 
- ""EIGNE""? Not common? 

Alternatively, if E is at position 4? Then the word: ? ? ? E N

And I must be at position 1 or 2? 

So two subcases:
- I at position 1: I ? ? E N
- I at position 2: ? I ? E N

We can try to form words for these patterns? 

First, I at position 1: I ? ? E N
We need two letters for positions 2 and 3? Avoid absent letters? And not E or I? 

Possible: 
- ""IMPEN""? But M,P? ""IMPEN"" is I,M,P,E,N? 
- ""INWEPT""? Too long? 
- ""INDEX""? But D and X? D is absent? 
- ""ILEX""? Only 4 letters? 
- ""IMAGE""? But A and G? A and G are absent? 
- ""INLET""? But L and E? But E is at position4? And T is absent? 
- ""INFER""? But F,E,R? R is absent? 
- ""INKED""? But K,E,D? D absent? 
- ""IVIED""? But V and D? D absent? and duplicate I? 

This is difficult? 

Second subcase: I at position 2: ? I ? E N
Word: _ I _ E N

We need position1 and position3? 

Possible words: 
- ""WIDEN""? But W and D? D absent? 
- ""GIVEN""? But G absent? 
- ""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? L and V? 
- ""MIVEN""? Not a word? 
- ""PIVEN""? Not common? 
- ""RIVEN""? But R absent? 
- ""HIVEN""? Not common? 
- ""JIVED""? But J and D? D absent? 

So ""LIVEN"" is a possibility? L,I,V,E,N? 

But we have to check if L and V are not absent? We haven't tested L or V? And they are not in the absent list? 

Similarly, for the other pattern? 

But we also have the case where E is at position1 and I at position2? 

We can try ""LIVEN"" to test the case where E is at position4 and I at position2? 

""LIVEN"": 
- Position1: L
- Position2: I
- Position3: V
- Position4: E
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position4? 
- I at position2? 
- And new letters L and V? 

But we know from guess3 that E is not at position2? But we are testing position4? 

Also, I is not at position3? But we are testing position2? 

If we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? And I at position2? Then we know? 

But if not? Then we can rule out? 

Alternatively, we can try to test the other case? 

But we have to choose one? 

Another idea: we can try a word that has E at position1? And I at position2? And then use common letters? 

For example, ""EIGHT"" is out because T absent? 

""EIKON"": E,I,K,O,N? 
- Position1: E
- Position2: I
- Position3: K
- Position4: O
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position1? 
- I at position2? 
- New letters K and O? 

And avoids absent letters? 

""EIKON"" is a word? Yes, meaning a religious image? 

So we have two candidates: 
- ""LIVEN"" (tests E at position4 and I at position2)
- ""EIKON"" (tests E at position1 and I at position2)

Which one to choose? 

We can choose based on which case is more likely? Or which letters are more common? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume the position of E? But we have to include E? 

But we have to assign E to either position1 or 4? 

We can choose ""EIKON"" because it tests the case where E is at position1? And if it's not, then we know E must be at position4? 

Similarly, if we choose ""LIVEN"", if E is not at position4, then it must be at position1? 

So both can help us determine? 

But we also test I at position2 in both? 

In ""EIKON"", I is at position2? 
In ""LIVEN"", I is at position2? 

So both test I at position2? 

So if I is at position2, we get a ✓? If not, we get '-'? Then I must be at position1? 

So we can get information about I? 

I think both are good? 

But let's choose ""EIKON"" because it uses O and K? Which are common? 

Or ""LIVEN"" uses L and V? 

But V is less common? 

So I'll go with ""EIKON"". 

But note: in ""EIKON"", we have E at position1? Which we haven't tested? And I at position2? 

If the secret word has E at position1, then we get ✓? If not, then E must be at position4? 

Similarly, if I is at position2, we get ✓? If not, then I must be at position1? 

And we test K and O? 

So let's guess ""EIKON"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
  - **Absent letters**: C, R, A.  
  - **N is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(✓)  
  - **Absent letters**: S, T.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 3 (and not in position 5, from Guess 1).  
  - **I is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **N is correct at position 5** (fixed).  

- **Guess 3: ""deign""** → D(x), E(-), I(-), G(x), N(✓)  
  - **Absent letters**: D, G.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 2 (new information).  
  - **I is present** but not in position 3 (new information).  
  - **N is correct at position 5** (confirmed).  

### Key Insights
- **Absent letters (total)**: C, R, A, S, T, D, G (cannot be used).  
- **Present letters**:  
  - **N**: Fixed at position 5.  
  - **E**: Present but not in positions 2, 3, or 5. Must be in position 1 or 4.  
  - **I**: Present but not in positions 3 or 4. Must be in position 1 or 2.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - E and I cannot occupy the same position.  
  - If E is in position 1, I must be in position 2 (since I cannot be in 1 if E is there).  
  - If E is in position 4, I can be in position 1 or 2.  
- **Unknowns**:  
  - Two additional letters are needed for positions 1–4 (alongside E and I).  
  - These letters must come from untested consonants/vowels: B, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Test critical positions for E and I**:  
  - E must be in 1 or 4. I must be in 1 or 2.  
  - Prioritize testing **E at position 1** and **I at position 2** (a likely case). If incorrect, we eliminate this scenario and deduce E must be in 4.  
- **Introduce new high-frequency letters**: Use untested common letters like K, O, L, or V to maximize information.  
- **Valid word structure**: Ensure the guess is a valid 5-letter word ending with N (position 5 fixed).  

### Chosen Guess: ""EIKON""
- **Word**: E-I-K-O-N  
- **Structure**:  
  - Position 1: E (tests if E is in position 1).  
  - Position 2: I (tests if I is in position 2).  
  - Position 3: K (new letter).  
  - Position 4: O (new letter).  
  - Position 5: N (fixed, known correct).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests the E-in-1 and I-in-2 scenario:  
    - If E is correct in position 1, feedback will show ✓.  
    - If I is correct in position 2, feedback will show ✓.  
    - If not, we deduce E must be in position 4, and I must be in position 1 (since position 2 would be ruled out).  
  - Introduces **K** and **O** (common untested letters).  
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, S, T, D, G).  
  - Valid English word (""eikon"" means a religious icon or symbol).  

### Expected Feedback Outcomes
- **If E is in position 1 and I in position 2**: Feedback will show E(✓), I(✓), and reveal if K/O are present.  
- **If E is not in position 1**: Feedback will show E(-), confirming E must be in position 4.  
- **If I is not in position 2**: Feedback will show I(-), confirming I must be in position 1.  
- **K and O**: Feedback will indicate if they are in the word (and their positions if present).  

This guess efficiently narrows down the positions of E and I while testing two new letters.

<guess>eikon</guess>",eikon,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A are absent. N is present but not in position 4. E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""stein"" -> S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)

Guess 3: ""deign"" -> D(x) E(-) I(-) G(x) N(✓)

So, summarizing:

- Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, D, G
- Present letters: E, I, N (with N fixed at position 5)
- E is not in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from guesses: not 5 from guess1, not 3 from guess2, not 2 from guess3). Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 4.
- I is not in positions 3 or 4 (from guess2: not 4, from guess3: not 3). Therefore, I must be in position 1 or 2.

But note: E and I cannot be in the same position. So we have two cases:

- ""INWEPT""? Too long? 
- ""INDEX""? But D and X? D is absent?

But we have to check if L and V are not absent? We haven't tested L or V? And they are not in the absent list? 

Similarly, for the other pattern? 

But we also have the case where E is at position1 and I at position2? 

We can try ""LIVEN"" to test the case where E is at position4 and I at position2? 

""LIVEN"": 
- Position1: L
- Position2: I
- Position3: V
- Position4: E
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position4? 
- I at position2? 
- And new letters L and V? 

But we know from guess3 that E is not at position2? But we are testing position4? 

Also, I is not at position3? But we are testing position2? 

If we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? And I at position2? Then we know? 

But if not? Then we can rule out? 

Alternatively, we can try to test the other case? 

But we have to choose one? 

Another idea: we can try a word that has E at position1? And I at position2? And then use common letters? 

For example, ""EIGHT"" is out because T absent? 

""EIKON"": E,I,K,O,N? 
- Position1: E
- Position2: I
- Position3: K
- Position4: O
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position1? 
- I at position2? 
- New letters K and O? 

And avoids absent letters? 

""EIKON"" is a word? Yes, meaning a religious image? 

So we have two candidates: 
- ""LIVEN"" (tests E at position4 and I at position2)
- ""EIKON"" (tests E at position1 and I at position2)

Which one to choose? 

We can choose based on which case is more likely? Or which letters are more common? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume the position of E? But we have to include E? 

But we have to assign E to either position1 or 4? 

We can choose ""EIKON"" because it tests the case where E is at position1? And if it's not, then we know E must be at position4? 

Similarly, if we choose ""LIVEN"", if E is not at position4, then it must be at position1? 

So both can help us determine? 

But we also test I at position2 in both? 

In ""EIKON"", I is at position2? 
In ""LIVEN"", I is at position2? 

So both test I at position2? 

So if I is at position2, we get a ✓? If not, we get '-'? Then I must be at position1? 

So we can get information about I? 

I think both are good? 

But let's choose ""EIKON"" because it uses O and K? Which are common? 

Or ""LIVEN"" uses L and V? 

But V is less common? 

So I'll go with ""EIKON"". 

But note: in ""EIKON"", we have E at position1? Which we haven't tested? And I at position2? 

If the secret word has E at position1, then we get ✓? If not, then E must be at position4? 

Similarly, if I is at position2, we get ✓? If not, then I must be at position1? 

And we test K and O? 

So let's guess ""EIKON"". 

<guess>eikon</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
  - **Absent letters**: C, R, A.  
  - **N is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(✓)  
  - **Absent letters**: S, T.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 3 (and not in position 5, from Guess 1).  
  - **I is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **N is correct at position 5** (fixed).  

- **Guess 3: ""deign""** → D(x), E(-), I(-), G(x), N(✓)  
  - **Absent letters**: D, G.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 2 (new information).  
  - **I is present** but not in position 3 (new information).  
  - **N is correct at position 5** (confirmed).  

### Key Insights
- **Absent letters (total)**: C, R, A, S, T, D, G (cannot be used).  
- **Present letters**:  
  - **N**: Fixed at position 5.  
  - **E**: Present but not in positions 2, 3, or 5. Must be in position 1 or 4.  
  - **I**: Present but not in positions 3 or 4. Must be in position 1 or 2.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - E and I cannot occupy the same position.  
  - If E is in position 1, I must be in position 2 (since I cannot be in 1 if E is there).  
  - If E is in position 4, I can be in position 1 or 2.  
- **Unknowns**:  
  - Two additional letters are needed for positions 1–4 (alongside E and I).  
  - These letters must come from untested consonants/vowels: B, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Test critical positions for E and I**:  
  - E must be in 1 or 4. I must be in 1 or 2.  
  - Prioritize testing **E at position 1** and **I at position 2** (a likely case). If incorrect, we eliminate this scenario and deduce E must be in 4.  
- **Introduce new high-frequency letters**: Use untested common letters like K, O, L, or V to maximize information.  
- **Valid word structure**: Ensure the guess is a valid 5-letter word ending with N (position 5 fixed).  

### Chosen Guess: ""EIKON""
- **Word**: E-I-K-O-N  
- **Structure**:  
  - Position 1: E (tests if E is in position 1).  
  - Position 2: I (tests if I is in position 2).  
  - Position 3: K (new letter).  
  - Position 4: O (new letter).  
  - Position 5: N (fixed, known correct).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests the E-in-1 and I-in-2 scenario:  
    - If E is correct in position 1, feedback will show ✓.  
    - If I is correct in position 2, feedback will show ✓.  
    - If not, we deduce E must be in position 4, and I must be in position 1 (since position 2 would be ruled out).  
  - Introduces **K** and **O** (common untested letters).  
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, S, T, D, G).  
  - Valid English word (""eikon"" means a religious icon or symbol).  

### Expected Feedback Outcomes
- **If E is in position 1 and I in position 2**: Feedback will show E(✓), I(✓), and reveal if K/O are present.  
- **If E is not in position 1**: Feedback will show E(-), confirming E must be in position 4.  
- **If I is not in position 2**: Feedback will show I(-), confirming I must be in position 1.  
- **K and O**: Feedback will indicate if they are in the word (and their positions if present).  

This guess efficiently narrows down the positions of E and I while testing two new letters.",Guess 4: eikon -> FEEDBACK: E(-) I(✓) K(✓) O(x) N(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C, R, A are not in the secret word at all (x)
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (-)
- E is also in the word but in the wrong position (-)

So, the secret word contains:
- N (but not in the fourth position, since in ""crane"" N was at position 4 and it was marked wrong position)
- E (not in the fifth position, since in ""crane"" E was at position 5)

Also, the secret word does NOT contain: C, R, A.

Since N and E are present but not in the positions we guessed, we must use other letters.

We have to avoid C, R, A.

For the next guess, we want to:
- Test new letters to find other characters in the word.
- Possibly reposition N and E to other positions to see where they belong.

Note: The word has 5 letters, so the positions are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Since N is present (but not at position 4), and E is present (but not at position 5), they must be in positions 1,2,3 or for N it can be in 1,2,3,5? But wait, E is at the end? Actually, positions 1,2,3,4,5 but we know not at the original spots.

However, we can try to put them in different positions.

We also know that the word does not have C, R, A, so we avoid those.

Common consonants and vowels: we have E already (a vowel) so we might need more vowels? Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. But we know A is out. So vowels available: E (we already have), and we can try I, O, U.

But we have only one E? Actually, the feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates, but typically in Wordle, each letter is considered individually. If there are duplicates, it might be tricky, but we don't know.

Given that, let's think of a word that:
- Does not contain C, R, A.
- Contains N and E, but not at the same positions as before (so not position 4 for N, not position 5 for E).
- Also, we want to test other common letters.

We can put N and E in different positions and add other letters that are common.

What are other common letters? Consider: T, S, L, I, O, U, etc.

For example, we can try to put E in a position other than 5, and N in a position other than 4.

Let me consider positions:

Possible words: 
- Option: Have E at the beginning? But then might conflict. Or in the middle.

We need to cover multiple possibilities.

Another good starting word might be to test more vowels and common consonants.

But we already have two vowels ruled out: A is out, and E is present. So we need at least another vowel? Typically, English words have vowels like E, and then one of I, O, U.

So let's try a word with E, N, and then new letters.

Example words:

We know E is present: so we can try E at position 1? But if we put E at the beginning, and it's correct then we get a check. Similarly, move N around.

What about ""LINEN""? But let's check: it has L, I, N, E, N. But note: possibly duplicate N? Also, does it avoid C, R, A? Yes.

But wait, the word must be 5 distinct letters? No, duplicates are allowed. So let's see the positions in ""LINEN"": 
Position1: L
Position2: I
Position3: N
Position4: E
Position5: N

Now, in our feedback, in the first guess we had N at position 4 marked as '-' (present but wrong position) and E at position 5 marked as '-' (present but wrong position).

In this word, we have:
- Position3: N
- Position4: E -> but in our first guess, E was at position5. Now we are putting E at position4? So if the secret word has E at position4, then it would be correct? But we don't know.
Similarly, N at position3 and also at position5.

But we also are introducing new letters: L and I.

Alternatively, let's avoid duplicate N for now? Since we don't know if there are duplicates.

Another idea: use a word that uses common letters and avoids C, R, A.

Let me list common letters without C, R, A: E, S, T, L, I, O, N, etc.

So a good candidate might be ""STONE"": 
- S, T, O, N, E

This has:
- S at position1
- T at position2
- O at position3
- N at position4 -> but wait, in first guess we had N at position4 and it was marked as '-' meaning N is present but not at position4. So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be wrong? Because we know it's not at position4. So that would be redundant.

So avoid putting N at position4 again.

Similarly, avoid putting E at position5.

In ""STONE"", N is at position4 (same as before) and E at position5 (same as before). So we would likely get the same feedback for those positions? So not helpful.

Thus, we might choose a word that moves N and E to other positions.

How about ""HONEY""? 
- H, O, N, E, Y

Positions:
1: H
2: O
3: N -> now we put N at position3 (previously it was at position4, which is wrong)
4: E -> now E at position4 (previously it was at position5, which was wrong)
5: Y

So we are testing N at position3 and E at position4, which are new positions.

Also, we introduce H, O, Y.

But the word must be a valid English word. ""HONEY"" is valid.

Alternatively, ""NOISE"": N,O,I,S,E
Positions:
1: N -> testing N at position1
2: O
3: I
4: S
5: E -> testing E at position5 again? We know E is not at position5 because in the first guess it was marked as wrong position. So if we put E at position5 again, we know it will be marked '-' again? So that doesn't give new information.

To maximize new information, avoid the positions we know are wrong.

So avoid:
- position4 for N (since we already know N is not at position4)
- position5 for E (since we know E is not at position5)

Thus, for the next guess, we should put N in positions 1,2,3 or 5? But position5 is currently occupied by E? Not necessarily.

We can assign:
- N: try positions 1,2,3,5? (avoid 4)
- E: try positions 1,2,3,4? (avoid 5)

So we have flexibility.

Let me try to form a word that has N at a position that is not 4 and E at a position that is not 5, and includes other common letters.

For example:
- ""UNITE"": U,N,I,T,E
Positions: 
1: U
2: N -> N at position2? That's new.
3: I
4: T
5: E -> but position5 is the same? We know E is not at 5? So if we put E at position5, we will get '-' again? And we know that already.

So we want to avoid E at position5? Yes.

Therefore, only positions 1,2,3,4 for E.

So in ""UNITE"", E is at position5? So avoid that.

Another try: ""BEGIN"": B,E,G,I,N
Positions:
1: B
2: E -> E at position2? That's new? Previously E was at position5.
3: G
4: I
5: N -> N at position5? That's new? Previously N was at position4.

This avoids the known wrong positions: 
- E not at position5? Now at position2? Which is new.
- N not at position4? Now at position5? Which is new.

Also, letters: B, E, G, I, N -> avoid C,R,A? Yes.

Is ""BEGIN"" a valid guess? Yes, common word.

The secret word does not have duplicates? We don't know, so it should be okay.

Alternatively, ""ENDOW"": E,N,D,O,W
Positions:
1: E -> E at position1? New.
2: N -> N at position2? New.
3: D
4: O
5: W? But E and N are both moved? But the word must be valid? ""ENDOW"" is valid.

We might want to prioritize high-frequency letters? For example, test T or S? Because we haven't tested T or S yet.

In our first guess ""crane"", we tested: C (x), R (x), A (x), N (-), E (-) -> so we haven't tested T, S, O, I, L, etc.

So including T or S might be helpful.

Thus, perhaps ""STOEN""? Not a word.

""SONET""? Not common.

""STINE""? Not very common.

How about ""STEIN"": S,T,E,I,N
Positions:
1: S
2: T
3: E -> E at position3? Previously E was at position5? So avoid 5? Now position3? New.
4: I
5: N -> N at position5? Previously N was at position4? So avoid 4? Now position5? New.

This word is valid? Yes, ""STEIN"" is acceptable (as in beer mug or a surname).

This way, we are testing two new positions for E and N, and we are introducing S, T, I.

We avoid C,R,A.

Alternatively, ""SPINE"": S,P,I,N,E -> N at position4? But that is the same as before? We know N is not at position4? So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be '-'? So that's not new information? Actually, if we put N at position4 and it was already known to not be there, it will be marked as '-', but we already know it's in the word? So we don't learn anything new? So we should avoid position4 for N.

In ""SPINE"", N is at position4? So that's redundant? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate: 
- S, T, E, I, N
- E at position3? Previously E was at position5? Which we know is wrong? We try position3? Which might be correct? Or wrong? Let's see.
- N at position5? Previously at position4 (wrong)? Now at position5? That's a new position.

Similarly, we test S, T, I.

Another alternative: maybe we try to cover more vowels? In ""STEIN"", we have E and I? That's good.

So I'll go with ""STEIN"".

Therefore, guess: STEIN

But note: in the feedback we know E is present, and we are moving it? Same with N.

Alternatively, ""BEING"": B,E,I,N,G -> but E at position2? and N at position4? But position4 for N we already know? So avoid? 

Because N at position4? We know it's not at position4? So we expect it to be marked as '-', but we already know that? So no new information? So inefficient.

Therefore, better to move N to a new position? So in ""STEIN"", N is at position5? That's a new position? So we get new information? Yes? Because if the secret word has N at position5, then we get ✓? Or if not, but still present? Then it will be '-'? Which tells us it's in the word but position5 is also wrong? Then we know not to put N at position4 nor position5? Then we have fewer positions? So we learn.

Similarly for E at position3? We know E is present? But if we put E at position3 and it's correct? We get ✓? Or if not, then '-'? Then we know it's not at position3? So we learn a new wrong position? And that is helpful.

So indeed, we learn about the positions.

Therefore, let's use ""STEIN"".

<guess>stein</guess>### Thought Process

After reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-), I inferred the following:
- **C, R, A are absent** from the secret word. This means any new guess must avoid these letters.
- **N is present but not in position 4** (since it was marked as wrong position in ""crane""). 
- **E is present but not in position 5** (marked as wrong position in ""crane""). 

The goal of the second guess is to:
1. Test N and E in new positions (avoiding position 4 for N and position 5 for E) to gather more information about their correct locations.
2. Introduce new common letters to maximize learning, focusing on untested consonants (like S, T, I) and vowels (like O or U), since A is ruled out.
  
After considering words that fit these criteria:
- Avoid words placing N at position 4 or E at position 5, as this would waste a guess by confirming known information.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., S, T, I) to increase the chance of hits.
- Ensure the word is valid and avoids C, R, A.

I evaluated several options:
- ""BEGIN"" (B,E,G,I,N) tests E at position 2 and N at position 5, but it misses common letters like S or T.
- ""UNITE"" (U,N,I,T,E) places E at position 5 (avoids this), so discarded.
- ""HONEY"" (H,O,N,E,Y) tests N at position 3 and E at position 4, but includes less common letters like Y.
- ""STEIN"" (S,T,E,I,N) emerged as a strong candidate because:
  - It tests E at position 3 (a new position, avoiding position 5).
  - It tests N at position 5 (a new position, avoiding position 4).
  - It introduces new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I (vowels not ruled out yet).
  - It avoids C, R, A entirely.
  
""STEIN"" is a valid English word and provides optimal position testing for E and N while maximizing coverage of untested letters.

### Guess

<guess>stein</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A are absent from the word.
- N is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).
- E is present but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).

Guess 2: ""stein"" -> S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)
Meaning:
- S and T are absent from the word.
- E is present but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in ""stein"" and marked as wrong position).
- I is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""stein"" and marked as wrong position).
- N is present and in the correct position: position 5 (since it was in position 5 in ""stein"" and marked as correct).

So, from both feedbacks, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T
Present letters: N (correctly placed at position 5), E (present but not in position 3 or 5), I (present but not in position 4)

Also, note that E was also not in position 5 from the first guess, so E is not in position 3 or 5. Similarly, N is fixed at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 5: N (fixed)
- The letter E is in the word, but not in positions 3 or 5. So it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 4. So it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

Also, we have 5 letters, so we need to find two more letters.

We know the word has at least E, I, and N (with N at the end).

Now, we need to form a new guess that:
- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T.
- Includes E (in a position that is not 3 or 5, so 1, 2, or 4) and I (in a position that is not 4, so 1, 2, or 3).
- Since N is fixed at position 5, we don't need to move it.

We also want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

Common letters we haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

But note: we have two positions to fill (besides the known N at the end) and we have to place E and I in the remaining positions? Actually, the word has 5 positions. We know position 5 is N. So positions 1,2,3,4 are to be filled with E, I, and two other letters? Or possibly E and I are two of them, and we need two more? But we don't know if there are duplicates? However, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback so far? But we can't rule out duplicates? But let's assume no duplicates for now? Because if there were duplicates, the feedback might have shown? But not necessarily? For example, if a letter appears twice, the feedback might show both? But in this case, we don't have any duplicate feedback? So we proceed with the assumption of no duplicates? But we should be cautious.

So the word has: 
- Position 5: N
- E is in one of positions 1,2,4? (but not 3 or 5)
- I is in one of positions 1,2,3? (but not 4)

But note: positions 1 and 2 are common for both E and I? So they could be in the same position? No, because each position can have only one letter? So we have to assign E and I to different positions? And then two more letters? But we have only 4 positions? Positions 1,2,3,4? And we have to place E and I in two of them? And then two other letters? But we have 5 letters? Position 5 is fixed? So we have 4 positions? And we have two known letters (E and I) to place? So we need two more unknown letters? Yes.

But we also have to consider that E and I might be in the word only once? So we have to assign E to one of {1,2,4} and I to one of {1,2,3}? But they can't be in the same position? So the possible positions for E and I are:

- If E is at 1, then I can be at 2 or 3.
- If E is at 2, then I can be at 1 or 3.
- If E is at 4, then I can be at 1,2, or 3.

But we also have two more letters to place? So we have to fill the remaining two positions with new letters? And we have to avoid C,R,A,S,T.

So for the next guess, we want to:
- Place E in one of the positions 1,2,4? But we don't know which? So we can choose one? And similarly for I? But we want to maximize information? So we might choose a word that tests E and I in positions that are likely? Or we can choose a word that tests new letters.

Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities? But we have to pick one word.

We can also try to use a word that has E and I in positions that we haven't ruled out? And also includes two new common letters.

For example, let's try to put E at position 4? Because in the first guess, E was at 5? Then in the second guess, E was at 3? So we haven't tested position 4 for E? And we haven't tested positions 1 and 2? But we can test position 4 for E? And for I, we can test position 1? Or 2? Or 3? But we already tested I at position 4? Which was wrong? So we can test I at position 1? Or 2? Or 3? We haven't tested any of these? So we can choose.

But note: if we put E at position 4? Then we can test if E is at position 4? If it is, we get a ✓? If not, we get a '-'? But if we get a '-', then we know E is not at position 4? Then it must be at 1 or 2? Similarly, we can test I at a new position.

But we also want to test new letters? So let's form a word.

For example, let's put E at position 4? Then we need to put I at one of 1,2,3? And then two new letters? And N at 5.

So the word: _ _ _ E N

We need to fill the first three positions? But one of them must be I? And the other two are new letters? And we avoid C,R,A,S,T.

So possible words? 

We can try: 
- Position 1: I? Then position 2 and 3: new letters? But I at position1? We haven't tested that? So we can try? Then the word: I ? ? E N

What words? Like ""IDIOM""? But that has D and M? But also O? And it's 5 letters? ""IDIOM"" has two I's? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But we have I already? So if we put I at position1? Then we have I at position1 and also in the word? But we don't know if the word has two I's? So it might be? But let's avoid duplicates for now? Because we haven't seen any? So we assume no duplicates? Then we cannot have two I's? So we cannot use ""IDIOM"" because it has two I's? Actually, ""IDIOM"" has I at position1 and position4? But position4 is E? So not? ""IDIOM"" is I,D,I,O,M? So two I's? So we avoid? Because we are assuming no duplicates? So we want a word with distinct letters? But the rules don't require distinct? But to avoid complexity, we can try to use distinct letters? But if we use a duplicate, we might get feedback that tells us? But for now, let's try to avoid? Because we have limited guesses? So we try to use distinct letters.

So for the word: I ? ? E N, with distinct letters? And ? are not C,R,A,S,T? And not E or I? Because E is at position4? And I at position1? So the middle two are new? And distinct? And not E or I? And not C,R,A,S,T.

So possible words: 
- ""ITEM""? But T is absent? We know T is absent? So cannot use T? 
- ""IDIOM"" has duplicate I? And T? Not? 
- ""IMAGE""? But M,A? A is absent? 
- ""INLET""? But N is at position5? And we have I at position1? Then L,E? But E is at position4? So ""INLET"" is I,N,L,E,T? But T is absent? And N is at position2? But we already have N at position5? And we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot have two N's? So avoid? 
- ""ICED""? Only 4 letters? 
- ""IDLER""? But R is absent? 
- ""IGLOO""? But duplicate O? And O? But also L? But ""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O? Duplicate O? And 5 letters? But we have E? We need E at position4? So not? 

Alternatively, put E at position4? And I at position2? Then the word: ? I ? E N

So positions: 1: new letter, 2: I, 3: new letter, 4: E, 5: N

Then the word: _ I _ E N

Possible words: 
- ""WIDEN"": W,I,D,E,N -> letters: W, I, D, E, N? Avoid C,R,A,S,T? Yes? And distinct? Yes? 
- ""GIVEN"": G,I,V,E,N? Avoid C,R,A,S,T? Yes? 
- ""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? 
- ""MIXEN""? Not common? 
- ""PIXEL""? But E at position4? But L at position5? But we need N at position5? So not? 
- ""WIDEN"", ""GIVEN"", ""LIVEN"" are options.

But we have to choose one? We can test two new letters? For example, in ""WIDEN"": we test W and D? 
In ""GIVEN"": G and V? 
In ""LIVEN"": L and V? 

Common letters: D, G, L, V, W? D and L are more common? 

But we also want to test the positions? We are putting E at position4? And I at position2? 

If we choose ""WIDEN"", we test:
- Position1: W? If it's present? 
- Position2: I? We know I is present? But we are testing position2? If I is at position2, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? 
- Position3: D? 
- Position4: E? We are testing if E is at position4? 
- Position5: N (already correct? So we get ✓? But we know that? So it will be marked ✓? 

Similarly for others.

But note: we are testing two things: 
1. Is E at position4? 
2. Is I at position2? 
3. And we test two new letters: for ""WIDEN"", we test W and D? 

If we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? If not, then E must be at position1 or 2? But if we put I at position2? Then if E is at position2? But we are putting I at position2? Then E cannot be at position2? Because one letter per position? So if we put I at position2, then E cannot be at position2? So if E is not at position4? Then it must be at position1? Because positions 3 and 5 are ruled out? And position2 is taken by I? 

Similarly, if we put I at position2? Then if I is not at position2? We get '-'? Then I must be at position1 or 3? 

But we are also testing new letters? 

Alternatively, we can put E at position1? Then the word: E ? ? ? N? And we need to put I at one of 2,3? And two new letters? 

But we haven't tested position1 for E? So we can try? 

For example: E ? ? ? N? With I at position2 or 3? 

But we have to fill? 

But let's see? We have more flexibility? 

But we have to choose one? 

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has both E and I? And also includes two common letters? And we choose positions that are not ruled out? 

But we have to avoid the absent letters? 

Let me list the possible positions for E and I? 

E: positions 1,2,4? (avoid 3,5)
I: positions 1,2,3? (avoid 4)

But they cannot be in the same position? 

So the possible pairs (E position, I position):
- (1,2): E at 1, I at 2
- (1,3): E at 1, I at 3
- (2,1): E at 2, I at 1
- (2,3): E at 2, I at 3
- (4,1): E at 4, I at 1
- (4,2): E at 4, I at 2
- (4,3): E at 4, I at 3

We have 7 possibilities? But we don't know which? 

We can try to choose a word that tests one of these? And also tests new letters? 

But we have to pick one? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests E at position4? And I at position1? For example? Then we can rule out or confirm? 

So let's try ""GIVEN"": G,I,V,E,N? 
- Position1: G
- Position2: I
- Position3: V
- Position4: E
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position4? 
- I at position2? 
- And new letters G and V? 

But we also test position2 for I? 

If we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? If not, then E must be at position1 or 2? But if I is at position2? Then E cannot be at position2? So if E is not at position4? Then E must be at position1? 

Similarly, if I is at position2? Then we get ✓? If not, then I must be at position1 or 3? 

So we get information? 

Similarly, we test G and V? 

But we can also choose ""WIDEN"": W,I,D,E,N? Same structure? 

But which one? 

""GIVEN"" has G and V? V is less common? W is also less common? 

""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? L is common? 

But we have another option: ""DIVEN""? Not a word? 

""PIXEN""? Not common? 

""BIKED""? But E at position4? But D? And B? But ""BIKED"" is B,I,K,E,D? But we need N at position5? Not? 

So the options are limited? 

Another word: ""OILED""? But E at position5? But we need E at position4? And N at position5? Not? 

""MINED"": M,I,N,E,D? But N at position3? But we have N at position5? And we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot have two N's? So avoid? 

So back to ""WIDEN"", ""GIVEN"", ""LIVEN""? 

I think ""GIVEN"" is a good word? Because G and V are not tested? 

But let's see the frequency? 

Alternatively, we can try to test E at position1? 

For example, ""EXIST""? But S and T are absent? 

""EDWIN""? Not common? 

""ELOIN"": E,L,O,I,N? 
- Position1: E
- Position2: L
- Position3: O
- Position4: I? But we know I is not at position4? Because in guess2, I was at position4 and marked as wrong position? So we cannot put I at position4? 

So avoid? 

""EIGHT"": But T absent? 

""ENVOY"": E,N,V,O,Y? But N at position2? But we have N at position5? Duplicate? Avoid? 

So it's hard to put E at position1? 

Similarly, put E at position2? 

For example, ""LEVIN""? L,E,V,I,N? 
- Position1: L
- Position2: E
- Position3: V
- Position4: I? But I cannot be at position4? Because we know I is not at position4? 

So avoid? 

""BEIGE""? But not 5 letters? And no N? 

""DEIGN"": D,E,I,G,N? 
- Position1: D
- Position2: E
- Position3: I
- Position4: G
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position2? 
- I at position3? 
- New letters D and G? 

And avoids C,R,A,S,T? 

Also, positions: 
- E at position2? We haven't tested that? 
- I at position3? We haven't tested that? 

So this is also a good candidate? 

""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to think or consider? 

So we have two options: 
- ""GIVEN"": tests E at position4 and I at position2? 
- ""DEIGN"": tests E at position2 and I at position3? 

Which one to choose? 

We can choose based on letter frequency? 

But also, we want to cover the positions that are more likely? 

In English, for words ending with N, common patterns? 

But let's see: 

In ""DEIGN"", we test E at position2 and I at position3? 

In ""GIVEN"", we test E at position4 and I at position2? 

But we know that E was not at position5 or 3? So position2 and 4 are possible? Similarly, I was not at position4? So position1,2,3 are possible? 

Both are valid? 

But in ""DEIGN"", we test two new positions: E at position2 and I at position3? 

In ""GIVEN"", we test E at position4 and I at position2? 

We have to choose one? 

I think ""DEIGN"" is a good choice? Because it tests two new positions? And D and G are common? 

But let's see the feedback? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests E at position1? But we couldn't find a good one? 

Another word: ""OWING""? But O,W,I,N,G? But E is missing? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? 

So we must include E? 

So ""DEIGN"" includes E? 

Similarly, ""GIVEN"" includes E? 

I think I'll go with ""DEIGN""? 

But let's see the feedback we might get? 

If we choose ""DEIGN"": 
- If E is at position2, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? 
- If I is at position3, we get ✓? If not, we get '-'? 
- We test D and G? 

Similarly for ""GIVEN""? 

But in ""GIVEN"", if we put I at position2? And if I is not at position2? Then we get '-'? And we know I must be at position1 or 3? 

But in ""DEIGN"", we test I at position3? 

I think both are fine? 

But let's choose ""DEIGN"" because it tests position3 for I? Which we haven't tested? 

So guess: DEIGN

But note: we have to write it in the format? 

But let's confirm the word: D-E-I-G-N

Yes.

So <guess>deign</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
  - **C, R, A are absent** from the secret word.  
  - **N is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(✓)  
  - **S and T are absent** from the secret word.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 3 (and not in position 5, from Guess 1).  
  - **I is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **N is correct and in position 5** (so position 5 is fixed as **N**).  

### Key Insights
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T (cannot be used).  
- **Present letters**:  
  - **N**: Correctly placed at position 5.  
  - **E**: Present but not in positions 3 or 5. Must be in position 1, 2, or 4.  
  - **I**: Present but not in position 4. Must be in position 1, 2, or 3.  
- **Word structure**:  
  - Position 5 is fixed as **N**.  
  - E and I must be placed in the remaining positions (1–4), but not in their invalid positions (E not in 3/5, I not in 4).  
  - Two additional unknown letters are needed to fill positions 1–4 (alongside E and I).  
- **Strategy for next guess**:  
  - Test E and I in new positions to narrow down their locations.  
  - Introduce new common letters (avoiding absent letters: C, R, A, S, T).  
  - Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., D, G, L, M) and vowels (O, U) not yet tested.  
  - Avoid duplicate letters for now (no duplicates indicated in feedback).  

### Choosing the Next Guess: ""DEIGN""
After evaluating options, **""DEIGN""** (D-E-I-G-N) is selected because:  
- **Tests E at position 2**: We know E is not in positions 3 or 5, so position 2 is a new, plausible location.  
- **Tests I at position 3**: We know I is not in position 4, so position 3 is a new, plausible location.  
- **Introduces new common letters**: D and G (high-frequency consonants not ruled out).  
- **Fits the fixed N at position 5**: Confirms the known correct letter/position.  
- **Avoids absent letters**: No C, R, A, S, T.  
- **Valid English word**: ""Deign"" means to do something reluctantly.  

### Expected Outcomes
- If E is in position 2, it will be marked ✓; otherwise, it will be marked - (wrong position).  
- If I is in position 3, it will be marked ✓; otherwise, it will be marked - (wrong position).  
- Feedback on D (position 1) and G (position 4) will reveal if they are in the word (and if so, their positions).  

This guess efficiently narrows down the positions for E and I while testing two new letters.

<guess>deign</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)
Guess 3: deign -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) I(-) G(x) N(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A are absent. N is present but not in position 4. E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""stein"" -> S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)
Meaning: S, T are absent. E is present but not in position 3. I is present but not in position 4. N is correct at position 5.

Guess 3: ""deign"" -> D(x) E(-) I(-) G(x) N(✓)
Meaning: D and G are absent. E is present but not in position 2 (since in ""deign"" E was at position 2 and marked as '-'). I is present but not in position 3 (since in ""deign"" I was at position 3 and marked as '-'). N is correct at position 5.

So, summarizing:

- Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, D, G
- Present letters: E, I, N (with N fixed at position 5)
- E is not in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from guesses: not 5 from guess1, not 3 from guess2, not 2 from guess3). Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 4.
- I is not in positions 3 or 4 (from guess2: not 4, from guess3: not 3). Therefore, I must be in position 1 or 2.

But note: E and I cannot be in the same position. So we have two cases:

Case 1: E at position 1, then I must be at position 2 (since I cannot be at 1 if E is there).
Case 2: E at position 4, then I can be at position 1 or 2.

But wait, if E is at position 4, then I can be at position 1 or 2? But we have to fill position 3 with a new letter? And we have two more letters? Actually, the word has 5 positions: 
Position 1: either E or I or a new letter? But we know E and I are present, so they must occupy two of the positions 1,2,3,4? And position 5 is N.

So the word has:
- Position 5: N
- E in {1,4}
- I in {1,2}

But if E is at 1, then I must be at 2 (since I cannot be at 1 and 2 is available). Then positions 3 and 4 must be filled with two new letters? But we have only two positions? And we have to avoid the absent letters.

If E is at 4, then I can be at 1 or 2? Then the other position (2 or 1) and position 3 must be filled with new letters? 

But we also know that we have two more letters to find? Because the word has 5 letters: we have E, I, N, and two more.

Now, from the feedback, we have used 7 absent letters: C,R,A,S,T,D,G. So we have many letters left? But we need to choose from the remaining.

Common letters left: B, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need to form a word that:
- Has N at position 5.
- E at position 1 or 4.
- I at position 1 or 2? But if E is at 1, then I must be at 2? If E is at 4, then I can be at 1 or 2? 

But we don't know which case? So we need to test? 

We can try to choose a word that covers one of the cases? 

For example, let's assume E is at position 1? Then I must be at position 2? Then the word is: E I ? ? N

Then we need to fill positions 3 and 4 with two new letters? And avoid absent letters.

Possible words: 
- ""EIKON""? But K? And O? But ""EIKON"" is E,I,K,O,N? 
- ""EILEN""? But E and N are already? And L? But ""EILEN"" is not common? 
- ""EIGHT""? But T is absent? 
- ""EIDER"": E,I,D,E,R? But D and R are absent? 
- ""EIGNE""? Not common? 

Alternatively, if E is at position 4? Then the word: ? ? ? E N

And I must be at position 1 or 2? 

So two subcases:
- I at position 1: I ? ? E N
- I at position 2: ? I ? E N

We can try to form words for these patterns? 

First, I at position 1: I ? ? E N
We need two letters for positions 2 and 3? Avoid absent letters? And not E or I? 

Possible: 
- ""IMPEN""? But M,P? ""IMPEN"" is I,M,P,E,N? 
- ""INWEPT""? Too long? 
- ""INDEX""? But D and X? D is absent? 
- ""ILEX""? Only 4 letters? 
- ""IMAGE""? But A and G? A and G are absent? 
- ""INLET""? But L and E? But E is at position4? And T is absent? 
- ""INFER""? But F,E,R? R is absent? 
- ""INKED""? But K,E,D? D absent? 
- ""IVIED""? But V and D? D absent? and duplicate I? 

This is difficult? 

Second subcase: I at position 2: ? I ? E N
Word: _ I _ E N

We need position1 and position3? 

Possible words: 
- ""WIDEN""? But W and D? D absent? 
- ""GIVEN""? But G absent? 
- ""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? L and V? 
- ""MIVEN""? Not a word? 
- ""PIVEN""? Not common? 
- ""RIVEN""? But R absent? 
- ""HIVEN""? Not common? 
- ""JIVED""? But J and D? D absent? 

So ""LIVEN"" is a possibility? L,I,V,E,N? 

But we have to check if L and V are not absent? We haven't tested L or V? And they are not in the absent list? 

Similarly, for the other pattern? 

But we also have the case where E is at position1 and I at position2? 

We can try ""LIVEN"" to test the case where E is at position4 and I at position2? 

""LIVEN"": 
- Position1: L
- Position2: I
- Position3: V
- Position4: E
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position4? 
- I at position2? 
- And new letters L and V? 

But we know from guess3 that E is not at position2? But we are testing position4? 

Also, I is not at position3? But we are testing position2? 

If we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? And I at position2? Then we know? 

But if not? Then we can rule out? 

Alternatively, we can try to test the other case? 

But we have to choose one? 

Another idea: we can try a word that has E at position1? And I at position2? And then use common letters? 

For example, ""EIGHT"" is out because T absent? 

""EIKON"": E,I,K,O,N? 
- Position1: E
- Position2: I
- Position3: K
- Position4: O
- Position5: N

This tests:
- E at position1? 
- I at position2? 
- New letters K and O? 

And avoids absent letters? 

""EIKON"" is a word? Yes, meaning a religious image? 

So we have two candidates: 
- ""LIVEN"" (tests E at position4 and I at position2)
- ""EIKON"" (tests E at position1 and I at position2)

Which one to choose? 

We can choose based on which case is more likely? Or which letters are more common? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't assume the position of E? But we have to include E? 

But we have to assign E to either position1 or 4? 

We can choose ""EIKON"" because it tests the case where E is at position1? And if it's not, then we know E must be at position4? 

Similarly, if we choose ""LIVEN"", if E is not at position4, then it must be at position1? 

So both can help us determine? 

But we also test I at position2 in both? 

In ""EIKON"", I is at position2? 
In ""LIVEN"", I is at position2? 

So both test I at position2? 

So if I is at position2, we get a ✓? If not, we get '-'? Then I must be at position1? 

So we can get information about I? 

I think both are good? 

But let's choose ""EIKON"" because it uses O and K? Which are common? 

Or ""LIVEN"" uses L and V? 

But V is less common? 

So I'll go with ""EIKON"". 

But note: in ""EIKON"", we have E at position1? Which we haven't tested? And I at position2? 

If the secret word has E at position1, then we get ✓? If not, then E must be at position4? 

Similarly, if I is at position2, we get ✓? If not, then I must be at position1? 

And we test K and O? 

So let's guess ""EIKON"". 

<guess>eikon</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  
  - **Absent letters**: C, R, A.  
  - **N is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(✓)  
  - **Absent letters**: S, T.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 3 (and not in position 5, from Guess 1).  
  - **I is present** but not in position 4.  
  - **N is correct at position 5** (fixed).  

- **Guess 3: ""deign""** → D(x), E(-), I(-), G(x), N(✓)  
  - **Absent letters**: D, G.  
  - **E is present** but not in position 2 (new information).  
  - **I is present** but not in position 3 (new information).  
  - **N is correct at position 5** (confirmed).  

### Key Insights
- **Absent letters (total)**: C, R, A, S, T, D, G (cannot be used).  
- **Present letters**:  
  - **N**: Fixed at position 5.  
  - **E**: Present but not in positions 2, 3, or 5. Must be in position 1 or 4.  
  - **I**: Present but not in positions 3 or 4. Must be in position 1 or 2.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - E and I cannot occupy the same position.  
  - If E is in position 1, I must be in position 2 (since I cannot be in 1 if E is there).  
  - If E is in position 4, I can be in position 1 or 2.  
- **Unknowns**:  
  - Two additional letters are needed for positions 1–4 (alongside E and I).  
  - These letters must come from untested consonants/vowels: B, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Test critical positions for E and I**:  
  - E must be in 1 or 4. I must be in 1 or 2.  
  - Prioritize testing **E at position 1** and **I at position 2** (a likely case). If incorrect, we eliminate this scenario and deduce E must be in 4.  
- **Introduce new high-frequency letters**: Use untested common letters like K, O, L, or V to maximize information.  
- **Valid word structure**: Ensure the guess is a valid 5-letter word ending with N (position 5 fixed).  

### Chosen Guess: ""EIKON""
- **Word**: E-I-K-O-N  
- **Structure**:  
  - Position 1: E (tests if E is in position 1).  
  - Position 2: I (tests if I is in position 2).  
  - Position 3: K (new letter).  
  - Position 4: O (new letter).  
  - Position 5: N (fixed, known correct).  
- **Why this word?**  
  - Tests the E-in-1 and I-in-2 scenario:  
    - If E is correct in position 1, feedback will show ✓.  
    - If I is correct in position 2, feedback will show ✓.  
    - If not, we deduce E must be in position 4, and I must be in position 1 (since position 2 would be ruled out).  
  - Introduces **K** and **O** (common untested letters).  
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, R, A, S, T, D, G).  
  - Valid English word (""eikon"" means a religious icon or symbol).  

### Expected Feedback Outcomes

But wait, E is at the end? Actually, positions 1,2,3,4,5 but we know not at the original spots.\n\nHowever, we can try to put them in different positions.\n\nWe also know that the word does not have C, R, A, so we avoid those.\n\nCommon consonants and vowels: we have E already (a vowel) so we might need more vowels? Common vowels are A, E, I, O, U. But we know A is out. So vowels available: E (we already have), and we can try I, O, U.\n\nBut we have only one E? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicates, but typically in Wordle, each letter is considered individually. If there are duplicates, it might be tricky, but we don\'t know.\n\nGiven that, let\'s think of a word that:\n- Does not contain C, R, A.\n- Contains N and E, but not at the same positions as before (so not position 4 for N, not position 5 for E).\n- Also, we want to test other common letters.\n\nWe can put N and E in different positions and add other letters that are common.\n\nWhat are other common letters? Consider: T, S, L, I, O, U, etc.\n\nFor example, we can try to put E in a position other than 5, and N in a position other than 4.\n\nLet me consider positions:\n\nPossible words: \n- Option: Have E at the beginning? But then might conflict. Or in the middle.\n\nWe need to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nAnother good starting word might be to test more vowels and common consonants.\n\nBut we already have two vowels ruled out: A is out, and E is present. So we need at least another vowel? Typically, English words have vowels like E, and then one of I, O, U.\n\nSo let\'s try a word with E, N, and then new letters.\n\nExample words:\n\nWe know E is present: so we can try E at position 1? But if we put E at the beginning, and it\'s correct then we get a check. Similarly, move N around.\n\nWhat about ""LINEN""? But let\'s check: it has L, I, N, E, N. But note: possibly duplicate N? Also, does it avoid C, R, A? Yes.\n\nBut wait, the word must be 5 distinct letters? No, duplicates are allowed. So let\'s see the positions in ""LINEN"": \nPosition1: L\nPosition2: I\nPosition3: N\nPosition4: E\nPosition5: N\n\nNow, in our feedback, in the first guess we had N at position 4 marked as \'-\' (present but wrong position) and E at position 5 marked as \'-\' (present but wrong position).\n\nIn this word, we have:\n- Position3: N\n- Position4: E -> but in our first guess, E was at position5. Now we are putting E at position4? So if the secret word has E at position4, then it would be correct? But we don\'t know.\nSimilarly, N at position3 and also at position5.\n\nBut we also are introducing new letters: L and I.\n\nAlternatively, let\'s avoid duplicate N for now? Since we don\'t know if there are duplicates.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that uses common letters and avoids C, R, A.\n\nLet me list common letters without C, R, A: E, S, T, L, I, O, N, etc.\n\nSo a good candidate might be ""STONE"": \n- S, T, O, N, E\n\nThis has:\n- S at position1\n- T at position2\n- O at position3\n- N at position4 -> but wait, in first guess we had N at position4 and it was marked as \'-\' meaning N is present but not at position4. So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be wrong? Because we know it\'s not at position4. So that would be redundant.\n\nSo avoid putting N at position4 again.\n\nSimilarly, avoid putting E at position5.\n\nIn ""STONE"", N is at position4 (same as before) and E at position5 (same as before). So we would likely get the same feedback for those positions? So not helpful.\n\nThus, we might choose a word that moves N and E to other positions.\n\nHow about ""HONEY""? \n- H, O, N, E, Y\n\nPositions:\n1: H\n2: O\n3: N -> now we put N at position3 (previously it was at position4, which is wrong)\n4: E -> now E at position4 (previously it was at position5, which was wrong)\n5: Y\n\nSo we are testing N at position3 and E at position4, which are new positions.\n\nAlso, we introduce H, O, Y.\n\nBut the word must be a valid English word. ""HONEY"" is valid.\n\nAlternatively, ""NOISE"": N,O,I,S,E\nPositions:\n1: N -> testing N at position1\n2: O\n3: I\n4: S\n5: E -> testing E at position5 again? We know E is not at position5 because in the first guess it was marked as wrong position. So if we put E at position5 again, we know it will be marked \'-\' again? So that doesn\'t give new information.\n\nTo maximize new information, avoid the positions we know are wrong.\n\nSo avoid:\n- position4 for N (since we already know N is not at position4)\n- position5 for E (since we know E is not at position5)\n\nThus, for the next guess, we should put N in positions 1,2,3 or 5? But position5 is currently occupied by E? Not necessarily.\n\nWe can assign:\n- N: try positions 1,2,3,5? (avoid 4)\n- E: try positions 1,2,3,4? (avoid 5)\n\nSo we have flexibility.\n\nLet me try to form a word that has N at a position that is not 4 and E at a position that is not 5, and includes other common letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""UNITE"": U,N,I,T,E\nPositions: \n1: U\n2: N -> N at position2? That\'s new.\n3: I\n4: T\n5: E -> but position5 is the same? We know E is not at 5? So if we put E at position5, we will get \'-\' again? And we know that already.\n\nSo we want to avoid E at position5? Yes.\n\nTherefore, only positions 1,2,3,4 for E.\n\nSo in ""UNITE"", E is at position5? So avoid that.\n\nAnother try: ""BEGIN"": B,E,G,I,N\nPositions:\n1: B\n2: E -> E at position2? That\'s new? Previously E was at position5.\n3: G\n4: I\n5: N -> N at position5? That\'s new? Previously N was at position4.\n\nThis avoids the known wrong positions: \n- E not at position5? Now at position2? Which is new.\n- N not at position4? Now at position5? Which is new.\n\nAlso, letters: B, E, G, I, N -> avoid C,R,A? Yes.\n\nIs ""BEGIN"" a valid guess? Yes, common word.\n\nThe secret word does not have duplicates? We don\'t know, so it should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, ""ENDOW"": E,N,D,O,W\nPositions:\n1: E -> E at position1? New.\n2: N -> N at position2? New.\n3: D\n4: O\n5: W? But E and N are both moved? But the word must be valid? ""ENDOW"" is valid.\n\nWe might want to prioritize high-frequency letters? For example, test T or S? Because we haven\'t tested T or S yet.\n\nIn our first guess ""crane"", we tested: C (x), R (x), A (x), N (-), E (-) -> so we haven\'t tested T, S, O, I, L, etc.\n\nSo including T or S might be helpful.\n\nThus, perhaps ""STOEN""? Not a word.\n\n""SONET""? Not common.\n\n""STINE""? Not very common.\n\nHow about ""STEIN"": S,T,E,I,N\nPositions:\n1: S\n2: T\n3: E -> E at position3? Previously E was at position5? So avoid 5? Now position3? New.\n4: I\n5: N -> N at position5? Previously N was at position4? So avoid 4? Now position5? New.\n\nThis word is valid? Yes, ""STEIN"" is acceptable (as in beer mug or a surname).\n\nThis way, we are testing two new positions for E and N, and we are introducing S, T, I.\n\nWe avoid C,R,A.\n\nAlternatively, ""SPINE"": S,P,I,N,E -> N at position4? But that is the same as before? We know N is not at position4? So if we put N at position4 again, it will still be \'-\'? So that\'s not new information? Actually, if we put N at position4 and it was already known to not be there, it will be marked as \'-\', but we already know it\'s in the word? So we don\'t learn anything new? So we should avoid position4 for N.\n\nIn ""SPINE"", N is at position4? So that\'s redundant? Yes.\n\nTherefore, I think ""STEIN"" is a good candidate: \n- S, T, E, I, N\n- E at position3? Previously E was at position5? Which we know is wrong? We try position3? Which might be correct? Or wrong? Let\'s see.\n- N at position5? Previously at position4 (wrong)? Now at position5? That\'s a new position.\n\nSimilarly, we test S, T, I.\n\nAnother alternative: maybe we try to cover more vowels? In ""STEIN"", we have E and I? That\'s good.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STEIN"".\n\nTherefore, guess: STEIN\n\nBut note: in the feedback we know E is present, and we are moving it? Same with N.\n\nAlternatively, ""BEING"": B,E,I,N,G -> but E at position2? and N at position4? But position4 for N we already know? So avoid? \n\nBecause N at position4? We know it\'s not at position4? So we expect it to be marked as \'-\', but we already know that? So no new information? So inefficient.\n\nTherefore, better to move N to a new position? So in ""STEIN"", N is at position5? That\'s a new position? So we get new information? Yes? Because if the secret word has N at position5, then we get ✓? Or if not, but still present? Then it will be \'-\'? Which tells us it\'s in the word but position5 is also wrong? Then we know not to put N at position4 nor position5? Then we have fewer positions? So we learn.\n\nSimilarly for E at position3? We know E is present? But if we put E at position3 and it\'s correct? We get ✓? Or if not, then \'-\'? Then we know it\'s not at position3? So we learn a new wrong position? And that is helpful.\n\nSo indeed, we learn about the positions.\n\nTherefore, let\'s use ""STEIN"".\n\n<guess>stein</guess>### Thought Process\n\nAfter reviewing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-), I inferred the following:\n- **C, R, A are absent** from the secret word. This means any new guess must avoid these letters.\n- **N is present but not in position 4** (since it was marked as wrong position in ""crane""). \n- **E is present but not in position 5** (marked as wrong position in ""crane""). \n\nThe goal of the second guess is to:\n1. Test N and E in new positions (avoiding position 4 for N and position 5 for E) to gather more information about their correct locations.\n2. Introduce new common letters to maximize learning, focusing on untested consonants (like S, T, I) and vowels (like O or U), since A is ruled out.\n  \nAfter considering words that fit these criteria:\n- Avoid words placing N at position 4 or E at position 5, as this would waste a guess by confirming known information.\n- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters (e.g., S, T, I) to increase the chance of hits.\n- Ensure the word is valid and avoids C, R, A.\n\nI evaluated several options:\n- ""BEGIN"" (B,E,G,I,N) tests E at position 2 and N at position 5, but it misses common letters like S or T.\n- ""UNITE"" (U,N,I,T,E) places E at position 5 (avoids this), so discarded.\n- ""HONEY"" (H,O,N,E,Y) tests N at position 3 and E at position 4, but includes less common letters like Y.\n- ""STEIN"" (S,T,E,I,N) emerged as a strong candidate because:\n  - It tests E at position 3 (a new position, avoiding position 5).\n  - It tests N at position 5 (a new position, avoiding position 4).\n  - It introduces new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I (vowels not ruled out yet).\n  - It avoids C, R, A entirely.\n  \n""STEIN"" is a valid English word and provides optimal position testing for E and N while maximizing coverage of untested letters.\n\n### Guess\n\n<guess>stein</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: stein -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A are absent from the word.\n- N is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).\n- E is present but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in ""crane"" and marked as wrong position).\n\nGuess 2: ""stein"" -> S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)\nMeaning:\n- S and T are absent from the word.\n- E is present but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in ""stein"" and marked as wrong position).\n- I is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in ""stein"" and marked as wrong position).\n- N is present and in the correct position: position 5 (since it was in position 5 in ""stein"" and marked as correct).\n\nSo, from both feedbacks, we know:\n\nAbsent letters: C, R, A, S, T\nPresent letters: N (correctly placed at position 5), E (present but not in position 3 or 5), I (present but not in position 4)\n\nAlso, note that E was also not in position 5 from the first guess, so E is not in position 3 or 5. Similarly, N is fixed at position 5.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Position 5: N (fixed)\n- The letter E is in the word, but not in positions 3 or 5. So it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 4. So it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nAlso, we have 5 letters, so we need to find two more letters.\n\nWe know the word has at least E, I, and N (with N at the end).\n\nNow, we need to form a new guess that:\n- Avoids the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T.\n- Includes E (in a position that is not 3 or 5, so 1, 2, or 4) and I (in a position that is not 4, so 1, 2, or 3).\n- Since N is fixed at position 5, we don\'t need to move it.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nBut note: we have two positions to fill (besides the known N at the end) and we have to place E and I in the remaining positions? Actually, the word has 5 positions. We know position 5 is N. So positions 1,2,3,4 are to be filled with E, I, and two other letters? Or possibly E and I are two of them, and we need two more? But we don\'t know if there are duplicates? However, we haven\'t seen any duplicate feedback so far? But we can\'t rule out duplicates? But let\'s assume no duplicates for now? Because if there were duplicates, the feedback might have shown? But not necessarily? For example, if a letter appears twice, the feedback might show both? But in this case, we don\'t have any duplicate feedback? So we proceed with the assumption of no duplicates? But we should be cautious.\n\nSo the word has: \n- Position 5: N\n- E is in one of positions 1,2,4? (but not 3 or 5)\n- I is in one of positions 1,2,3? (but not 4)\n\nBut note: positions 1 and 2 are common for both E and I? So they could be in the same position? No, because each position can have only one letter? So we have to assign E and I to different positions? And then two more letters? But we have only 4 positions? Positions 1,2,3,4? And we have to place E and I in two of them? And then two other letters? But we have 5 letters? Position 5 is fixed? So we have 4 positions? And we have two known letters (E and I) to place? So we need two more unknown letters? Yes.\n\nBut we also have to consider that E and I might be in the word only once? So we have to assign E to one of {1,2,4} and I to one of {1,2,3}? But they can\'t be in the same position? So the possible positions for E and I are:\n\n- If E is at 1, then I can be at 2 or 3.\n- If E is at 2, then I can be at 1 or 3.\n- If E is at 4, then I can be at 1,2, or 3.\n\nBut we also have two more letters to place? So we have to fill the remaining two positions with new letters? And we have to avoid C,R,A,S,T.\n\nSo for the next guess, we want to:\n- Place E in one of the positions 1,2,4? But we don\'t know which? So we can choose one? And similarly for I? But we want to maximize information? So we might choose a word that tests E and I in positions that are likely? Or we can choose a word that tests new letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities? But we have to pick one word.\n\nWe can also try to use a word that has E and I in positions that we haven\'t ruled out? And also includes two new common letters.\n\nFor example, let\'s try to put E at position 4? Because in the first guess, E was at 5? Then in the second guess, E was at 3? So we haven\'t tested position 4 for E? And we haven\'t tested positions 1 and 2? But we can test position 4 for E? And for I, we can test position 1? Or 2? Or 3? But we already tested I at position 4? Which was wrong? So we can test I at position 1? Or 2? Or 3? We haven\'t tested any of these? So we can choose.\n\nBut note: if we put E at position 4? Then we can test if E is at position 4? If it is, we get a ✓? If not, we get a \'-\'? But if we get a \'-\', then we know E is not at position 4? Then it must be at 1 or 2? Similarly, we can test I at a new position.\n\nBut we also want to test new letters? So let\'s form a word.\n\nFor example, let\'s put E at position 4? Then we need to put I at one of 1,2,3? And then two new letters? And N at 5.\n\nSo the word: _ _ _ E N\n\nWe need to fill the first three positions? But one of them must be I? And the other two are new letters? And we avoid C,R,A,S,T.\n\nSo possible words? \n\nWe can try: \n- Position 1: I? Then position 2 and 3: new letters? But I at position1? We haven\'t tested that? So we can try? Then the word: I ? ? E N\n\nWhat words? Like ""IDIOM""? But that has D and M? But also O? And it\'s 5 letters? ""IDIOM"" has two I\'s? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But we have I already? So if we put I at position1? Then we have I at position1 and also in the word? But we don\'t know if the word has two I\'s? So it might be? But let\'s avoid duplicates for now? Because we haven\'t seen any? So we assume no duplicates? Then we cannot have two I\'s? So we cannot use ""IDIOM"" because it has two I\'s? Actually, ""IDIOM"" has I at position1 and position4? But position4 is E? So not? ""IDIOM"" is I,D,I,O,M? So two I\'s? So we avoid? Because we are assuming no duplicates? So we want a word with distinct letters? But the rules don\'t require distinct? But to avoid complexity, we can try to use distinct letters? But if we use a duplicate, we might get feedback that tells us? But for now, let\'s try to avoid? Because we have limited guesses? So we try to use distinct letters.\n\nSo for the word: I ? ? E N, with distinct letters? And ? are not C,R,A,S,T? And not E or I? Because E is at position4? And I at position1? So the middle two are new? And distinct? And not E or I? And not C,R,A,S,T.\n\nSo possible words: \n- ""ITEM""? But T is absent? We know T is absent? So cannot use T? \n- ""IDIOM"" has duplicate I? And T? Not? \n- ""IMAGE""? But M,A? A is absent? \n- ""INLET""? But N is at position5? And we have I at position1? Then L,E? But E is at position4? So ""INLET"" is I,N,L,E,T? But T is absent? And N is at position2? But we already have N at position5? And we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot have two N\'s? So avoid? \n- ""ICED""? Only 4 letters? \n- ""IDLER""? But R is absent? \n- ""IGLOO""? But duplicate O? And O? But also L? But ""IGLOO"" is I,G,L,O,O? Duplicate O? And 5 letters? But we have E? We need E at position4? So not? \n\nAlternatively, put E at position4? And I at position2? Then the word: ? I ? E N\n\nSo positions: 1: new letter, 2: I, 3: new letter, 4: E, 5: N\n\nThen the word: _ I _ E N\n\nPossible words: \n- ""WIDEN"": W,I,D,E,N -> letters: W, I, D, E, N? Avoid C,R,A,S,T? Yes? And distinct? Yes? \n- ""GIVEN"": G,I,V,E,N? Avoid C,R,A,S,T? Yes? \n- ""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? \n- ""MIXEN""? Not common? \n- ""PIXEL""? But E at position4? But L at position5? But we need N at position5? So not? \n- ""WIDEN"", ""GIVEN"", ""LIVEN"" are options.\n\nBut we have to choose one? We can test two new letters? For example, in ""WIDEN"": we test W and D? \nIn ""GIVEN"": G and V? \nIn ""LIVEN"": L and V? \n\nCommon letters: D, G, L, V, W? D and L are more common? \n\nBut we also want to test the positions? We are putting E at position4? And I at position2? \n\nIf we choose ""WIDEN"", we test:\n- Position1: W? If it\'s present? \n- Position2: I? We know I is present? But we are testing position2? If I is at position2, we get ✓? If not, we get \'-\'? \n- Position3: D? \n- Position4: E? We are testing if E is at position4? \n- Position5: N (already correct? So we get ✓? But we know that? So it will be marked ✓? \n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut note: we are testing two things: \n1. Is E at position4? \n2. Is I at position2? \n3. And we test two new letters: for ""WIDEN"", we test W and D? \n\nIf we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? If not, then E must be at position1 or 2? But if we put I at position2? Then if E is at position2? But we are putting I at position2? Then E cannot be at position2? Because one letter per position? So if we put I at position2, then E cannot be at position2? So if E is not at position4? Then it must be at position1? Because positions 3 and 5 are ruled out? And position2 is taken by I? \n\nSimilarly, if we put I at position2? Then if I is not at position2? We get \'-\'? Then I must be at position1 or 3? \n\nBut we are also testing new letters? \n\nAlternatively, we can put E at position1? Then the word: E ? ? ? N? And we need to put I at one of 2,3? And two new letters? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested position1 for E? So we can try? \n\nFor example: E ? ? ? N? With I at position2 or 3? \n\nBut we have to fill? \n\nBut let\'s see? We have more flexibility? \n\nBut we have to choose one? \n\nAnother idea: we can try to use a word that has both E and I? And also includes two common letters? And we choose positions that are not ruled out? \n\nBut we have to avoid the absent letters? \n\nLet me list the possible positions for E and I? \n\nE: positions 1,2,4? (avoid 3,5)\nI: positions 1,2,3? (avoid 4)\n\nBut they cannot be in the same position? \n\nSo the possible pairs (E position, I position):\n- (1,2): E at 1, I at 2\n- (1,3): E at 1, I at 3\n- (2,1): E at 2, I at 1\n- (2,3): E at 2, I at 3\n- (4,1): E at 4, I at 1\n- (4,2): E at 4, I at 2\n- (4,3): E at 4, I at 3\n\nWe have 7 possibilities? But we don\'t know which? \n\nWe can try to choose a word that tests one of these? And also tests new letters? \n\nBut we have to pick one? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests E at position4? And I at position1? For example? Then we can rule out or confirm? \n\nSo let\'s try ""GIVEN"": G,I,V,E,N? \n- Position1: G\n- Position2: I\n- Position3: V\n- Position4: E\n- Position5: N\n\nThis tests:\n- E at position4? \n- I at position2? \n- And new letters G and V? \n\nBut we also test position2 for I? \n\nIf we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? If not, then E must be at position1 or 2? But if I is at position2? Then E cannot be at position2? So if E is not at position4? Then E must be at position1? \n\nSimilarly, if I is at position2? Then we get ✓? If not, then I must be at position1 or 3? \n\nSo we get information? \n\nSimilarly, we test G and V? \n\nBut we can also choose ""WIDEN"": W,I,D,E,N? Same structure? \n\nBut which one? \n\n""GIVEN"" has G and V? V is less common? W is also less common? \n\n""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? L is common? \n\nBut we have another option: ""DIVEN""? Not a word? \n\n""PIXEN""? Not common? \n\n""BIKED""? But E at position4? But D? And B? But ""BIKED"" is B,I,K,E,D? But we need N at position5? Not? \n\nSo the options are limited? \n\nAnother word: ""OILED""? But E at position5? But we need E at position4? And N at position5? Not? \n\n""MINED"": M,I,N,E,D? But N at position3? But we have N at position5? And we are assuming no duplicates? So we cannot have two N\'s? So avoid? \n\nSo back to ""WIDEN"", ""GIVEN"", ""LIVEN""? \n\nI think ""GIVEN"" is a good word? Because G and V are not tested? \n\nBut let\'s see the frequency? \n\nAlternatively, we can try to test E at position1? \n\nFor example, ""EXIST""? But S and T are absent? \n\n""EDWIN""? Not common? \n\n""ELOIN"": E,L,O,I,N? \n- Position1: E\n- Position2: L\n- Position3: O\n- Position4: I? But we know I is not at position4? Because in guess2, I was at position4 and marked as wrong position? So we cannot put I at position4? \n\nSo avoid? \n\n""EIGHT"": But T absent? \n\n""ENVOY"": E,N,V,O,Y? But N at position2? But we have N at position5? Duplicate? Avoid? \n\nSo it\'s hard to put E at position1? \n\nSimilarly, put E at position2? \n\nFor example, ""LEVIN""? L,E,V,I,N? \n- Position1: L\n- Position2: E\n- Position3: V\n- Position4: I? But I cannot be at position4? Because we know I is not at position4? \n\nSo avoid? \n\n""BEIGE""? But not 5 letters? And no N? \n\n""DEIGN"": D,E,I,G,N? \n- Position1: D\n- Position2: E\n- Position3: I\n- Position4: G\n- Position5: N\n\nThis tests:\n- E at position2? \n- I at position3? \n- New letters D and G? \n\nAnd avoids C,R,A,S,T? \n\nAlso, positions: \n- E at position2? We haven\'t tested that? \n- I at position3? We haven\'t tested that? \n\nSo this is also a good candidate? \n\n""DEIGN"" is a word? Yes, meaning to think or consider? \n\nSo we have two options: \n- ""GIVEN"": tests E at position4 and I at position2? \n- ""DEIGN"": tests E at position2 and I at position3? \n\nWhich one to choose? \n\nWe can choose based on letter frequency? \n\nBut also, we want to cover the positions that are more likely? \n\nIn English, for words ending with N, common patterns? \n\nBut let\'s see: \n\nIn ""DEIGN"", we test E at position2 and I at position3? \n\nIn ""GIVEN"", we test E at position4 and I at position2? \n\nBut we know that E was not at position5 or 3? So position2 and 4 are possible? Similarly, I was not at position4? So position1,2,3 are possible? \n\nBoth are valid? \n\nBut in ""DEIGN"", we test two new positions: E at position2 and I at position3? \n\nIn ""GIVEN"", we test E at position4 and I at position2? \n\nWe have to choose one? \n\nI think ""DEIGN"" is a good choice? Because it tests two new positions? And D and G are common? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests E at position1? But we couldn\'t find a good one? \n\nAnother word: ""OWING""? But O,W,I,N,G? But E is missing? We must include E? Because we know E is in the word? \n\nSo we must include E? \n\nSo ""DEIGN"" includes E? \n\nSimilarly, ""GIVEN"" includes E? \n\nI think I\'ll go with ""DEIGN""? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get? \n\nIf we choose ""DEIGN"": \n- If E is at position2, we get ✓? If not, we get \'-\'? \n- If I is at position3, we get ✓? If not, we get \'-\'? \n- We test D and G? \n\nSimilarly for ""GIVEN""? \n\nBut in ""GIVEN"", if we put I at position2? And if I is not at position2? Then we get \'-\'? And we know I must be at position1 or 3? \n\nBut in ""DEIGN"", we test I at position3? \n\nI think both are fine? \n\nBut let\'s choose ""DEIGN"" because it tests position3 for I? Which we haven\'t tested? \n\nSo guess: DEIGN\n\nBut note: we have to write it in the format? \n\nBut let\'s confirm the word: D-E-I-G-N\n\nYes.\n\nSo <guess>deign</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  \n  - **C, R, A are absent** from the secret word.  \n  - **N is present** but not in position 4.  \n  - **E is present** but not in position 5.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(✓)  \n  - **S and T are absent** from the secret word.  \n  - **E is present** but not in position 3 (and not in position 5, from Guess 1).  \n  - **I is present** but not in position 4.  \n  - **N is correct and in position 5** (so position 5 is fixed as **N**).  \n\n### Key Insights\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T (cannot be used).  \n- **Present letters**:  \n  - **N**: Correctly placed at position 5.  \n  - **E**: Present but not in positions 3 or 5.

E is present but not in position 2 (since in ""deign"" E was at position 2 and marked as \'-\'). I is present but not in position 3 (since in ""deign"" I was at position 3 and marked as \'-\'). N is correct at position 5.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, D, G\n- Present letters: E, I, N (with N fixed at position 5)\n- E is not in positions 2, 3, or 5 (from guesses: not 5 from guess1, not 3 from guess2, not 2 from guess3). Therefore, E must be in position 1 or 4.\n- I is not in positions 3 or 4 (from guess2: not 4, from guess3: not 3). Therefore, I must be in position 1 or 2.\n\nBut note: E and I cannot be in the same position. So we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: E at position 1, then I must be at position 2 (since I cannot be at 1 if E is there).\nCase 2: E at position 4, then I can be at position 1 or 2.\n\nBut wait, if E is at position 4, then I can be at position 1 or 2? But we have to fill position 3 with a new letter? And we have two more letters? Actually, the word has 5 positions: \nPosition 1: either E or I or a new letter? But we know E and I are present, so they must occupy two of the positions 1,2,3,4? And position 5 is N.\n\nSo the word has:\n- Position 5: N\n- E in {1,4}\n- I in {1,2}\n\nBut if E is at 1, then I must be at 2 (since I cannot be at 1 and 2 is available). Then positions 3 and 4 must be filled with two new letters? But we have only two positions? And we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nIf E is at 4, then I can be at 1 or 2? Then the other position (2 or 1) and position 3 must be filled with new letters? \n\nBut we also know that we have two more letters to find? Because the word has 5 letters: we have E, I, N, and two more.\n\nNow, from the feedback, we have used 7 absent letters: C,R,A,S,T,D,G. So we have many letters left? But we need to choose from the remaining.\n\nCommon letters left: B, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe need to form a word that:\n- Has N at position 5.\n- E at position 1 or 4.\n- I at position 1 or 2? But if E is at 1, then I must be at 2? If E is at 4, then I can be at 1 or 2? \n\nBut we don\'t know which case? So we need to test? \n\nWe can try to choose a word that covers one of the cases? \n\nFor example, let\'s assume E is at position 1? Then I must be at position 2? Then the word is: E I ? ? N\n\nThen we need to fill positions 3 and 4 with two new letters? And avoid absent letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""EIKON""? But K? And O? But ""EIKON"" is E,I,K,O,N? \n- ""EILEN""?

Not common? \n\nAlternatively, if E is at position 4? Then the word: ? ? ? E N\n\nAnd I must be at position 1 or 2? \n\nSo two subcases:\n- I at position 1: I ? ? E N\n- I at position 2: ? I ? E N\n\nWe can try to form words for these patterns? \n\nFirst, I at position 1: I ? ? E N\nWe need two letters for positions 2 and 3? Avoid absent letters? And not E or I? \n\nPossible: \n- ""IMPEN""? But M,P? ""IMPEN"" is I,M,P,E,N? \n- ""INWEPT""? Too long? \n- ""INDEX""? But D and X? D is absent? \n- ""ILEX""? Only 4 letters? \n- ""IMAGE""? But A and G? A and G are absent? \n- ""INLET""? But L and E? But E is at position4? And T is absent? \n- ""INFER""? But F,E,R? R is absent? \n- ""INKED""? But K,E,D? D absent? \n- ""IVIED""? But V and D? D absent? and duplicate I? \n\nThis is difficult? \n\nSecond subcase: I at position 2: ? I ? E N\nWord: _ I _ E N\n\nWe need position1 and position3? \n\nPossible words: \n- ""WIDEN""? But W and D? D absent? \n- ""GIVEN""? But G absent? \n- ""LIVEN"": L,I,V,E,N? L and V? \n- ""MIVEN""? Not a word? \n- ""PIVEN""? Not common? \n- ""RIVEN""? But R absent? \n- ""HIVEN""? Not common? \n- ""JIVED""? But J and D? D absent? \n\nSo ""LIVEN"" is a possibility? L,I,V,E,N? \n\nBut we have to check if L and V are not absent? We haven\'t tested L or V? And they are not in the absent list? \n\nSimilarly, for the other pattern? \n\nBut we also have the case where E is at position1 and I at position2? \n\nWe can try ""LIVEN"" to test the case where E is at position4 and I at position2? \n\n""LIVEN"": \n- Position1: L\n- Position2: I\n- Position3: V\n- Position4: E\n- Position5: N\n\nThis tests:\n- E at position4? \n- I at position2? \n- And new letters L and V? \n\nBut we know from guess3 that E is not at position2? But we are testing position4? \n\nAlso, I is not at position3? But we are testing position2? \n\nIf we get feedback that E is at position4? Then we know? And I at position2? Then we know? \n\nBut if not? Then we can rule out? \n\nAlternatively, we can try to test the other case? \n\nBut we have to choose one? \n\nAnother idea: we can try a word that has E at position1? And I at position2? And then use common letters? \n\nFor example, ""EIGHT"" is out because T absent? \n\n""EIKON"": E,I,K,O,N? \n- Position1: E\n- Position2: I\n- Position3: K\n- Position4: O\n- Position5: N\n\nThis tests:\n- E at position1? \n- I at position2? \n- New letters K and O? \n\nAnd avoids absent letters? \n\n""EIKON"" is a word? Yes, meaning a religious image? \n\nSo we have two candidates: \n- ""LIVEN"" (tests E at position4 and I at position2)\n- ""EIKON"" (tests E at position1 and I at position2)\n\nWhich one to choose? \n\nWe can choose based on which case is more likely? Or which letters are more common? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t assume the position of E? But we have to include E? \n\nBut we have to assign E to either position1 or 4? \n\nWe can choose ""EIKON"" because it tests the case where E is at position1? And if it\'s not, then we know E must be at position4? \n\nSimilarly, if we choose ""LIVEN"", if E is not at position4, then it must be at position1? \n\nSo both can help us determine? \n\nBut we also test I at position2 in both? \n\nIn ""EIKON"", I is at position2? \nIn ""LIVEN"", I is at position2? \n\nSo both test I at position2? \n\nSo if I is at position2, we get a ✓? If not, we get \'-\'? Then I must be at position1? \n\nSo we can get information about I? \n\nI think both are good? \n\nBut let\'s choose ""EIKON"" because it uses O and K? Which are common? \n\nOr ""LIVEN"" uses L and V? \n\nBut V is less common? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""EIKON"". \n\nBut note: in ""EIKON"", we have E at position1? Which we haven\'t tested? And I at position2? \n\nIf the secret word has E at position1, then we get ✓? If not, then E must be at position4? \n\nSimilarly, if I is at position2, we get ✓? If not, then I must be at position1? \n\nAnd we test K and O? \n\nSo let\'s guess ""EIKON"". \n\n<guess>eikon</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → C(x), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(-)  \n  - **Absent letters**: C, R, A.  \n  - **N is present** but not in position 4.  \n  - **E is present** but not in position 5.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""stein""** → S(x), T(x), E(-), I(-), N(✓)  \n  - **Absent letters**: S, T.  \n  - **E is present** but not in position 3 (and not in position 5, from Guess 1).  \n  - **I is present** but not in position 4.  \n  - **N is correct at position 5** (fixed).  \n\n- **Guess 3: ""deign""** → D(x), E(-), I(-), G(x), N(✓)  \n  - **Absent letters**: D, G.  \n  - **E is present** but not in position 2 (new information).  \n  - **I is present** but not in position 3 (new information).  \n  - **N is correct at position 5** (confirmed).  \n\n### Key Insights\n- **Absent letters (total)**: C, R, A, S, T, D, G (cannot be used).  \n- **Present letters**:  \n  - **N**: Fixed at position 5.  \n  - **E**: Present but not in positions 2, 3, or 5.

We are given feedback for four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A are absent. N is present but not at position 4. E is present but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""stein"" -> S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)
Meaning: S, T are absent. E is present but not at position 3. I is present but not at position 4. N is correct at position 5.

Guess 3: ""deign"" -> D(x) E(-) I(-) G(x) N(✓)
Meaning: D, G are absent. E is present but not at position 2. I is present but not at position 3. N is correct at position 5.

Guess 4: ""eikon"" -> E(-) I(✓) K(✓) O(x) N(✓)
Meaning: 
- E is present but not at position 1 (since it was at position 1 and marked '-'). 
- I is correct at position 2 (so position 2 is I). 
- K is correct at position 3 (so position 3 is K). 
- O is absent (so O is not in the word). 
- N is correct at position 5 (confirmed). 

Now, combining all feedback:

- Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, D, G, O
- Present letters: E, I, K, N
- Fixed positions:
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 3: K
  - Position 5: N
- E is present but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from guesses: not 5 from guess1, not 3 from guess2, not 2 from guess3, not 1 from guess4). Therefore, E must be in position 4? Because that is the only position left? Positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We fixed 3 positions: 2,3,5. So positions 1 and 4 are open? But E has been ruled out from positions 1,2,3,5? So E must be in position 4? 

But position 2 is I, position 3 is K, position 5 is N. So we have:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: I (fixed)
Position 3: K (fixed)
Position 4: ?
Position 5: N (fixed)

We know E is present? And must be somewhere? Since E is not in positions 1,2,3,5, it must be in position 4?

Yes. Therefore, position 4 must be E.

So the secret word is: ? I K E N

We have to find the first letter. 

We know the first letter must not be any of the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, D, G, O. And also not I, K, E, N? Because we are assuming no duplicates? Because so far, we haven't had any duplicate feedback? So we assume the first letter is a new letter? That is not in the absent list and not E, I, K, N? 

Present letters: E, I, K, N. So we have four letters? But the word must have five? So we need one more letter? Which must be in position 1? 

So we need a letter that:
- Is not in the absent list (C, R, A, S, T, D, G, O)
- Is not E, I, K, N (assuming no duplicates)
- Forms a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 1: from the remaining alphabet? 

Remaining letters: B, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.? 

We can try to form words: _ I K E N

Possible words:
- ""BIKEN"" — not common? 
- ""FIKEN"" — not common? 
- ""HIKEN"" — not common? 
- ""LIKEN"" — meaning: to compare. Valid word? Yes: L-I-K-E-N.
- ""MIKEN"" — not common.
- ""PIKEN"" — not common? 
- ""WIKEN"" — not common?
- ""VIKEN"" — not common?

The most common word is ""LIKEN"".

Check: ""LIKEN"" — L, I, K, E, N.

We haven't tested L? So it is not in the absent list? So it's possible? 

Could there be others? Like ""MINKE""? But that has M and E? But the pattern is ? I K E N? And M at position1? Then ""minen"" is not a word? We need exactly ? I K E N.

Another option? ""WIKEN"" not? 

So ""LIKEN"" is a valid word: L-I-K-E-N.

We can test L? If L is in the word? But we don't know? But since we have only one position left? And we know the letters? We can try ""LIKEN""? 

But we have to check if L is absent? But we haven't had feedback that L is absent? So it might be present? 

But the word is almost determined? We know four positions: 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:N? And only position1 is unknown? So the word is XIKEN? 

Possible words: we listed ""LIKEN"". Are there others? 

""BIKEN""? Not common? 
""PIKEN""? Not common? 

In English, ""liken"" is a word? Yes: liken meaning to represent as similar. 

So we can guess ""LIKEN""? 

But note: we have only one guess left? We have used 4 guesses? And we have 6 tries? So we have tries left? But this might be the solution? 

Alternatively, we can confirm? 

So we guess ""LIKEN"". 

But let's see feedback? 

Alternatively, if there is another possibility? Could E be duplicated? But we have position4 as E? And E is also elsewhere? But we ruled out E in other positions? So no? 

Similarly, the first letter must be a letter not blocked? 

So I think ""LIKEN"" is the candidate? 

Therefore, we guess ""LIKEN"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From all guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Confirmed **C, R, A** absent. **N** present (not position 4). **E** present (not position 5).
- **Guess 2 (""stein"")**: Confirmed **S, T** absent. **E** present (not position 3). **I** present (not position 4). **N** correct at position 5.
- **Guess 3 (""deign"")**: Confirmed **D, G** absent. **E** present (not position 2). **I** present (not position 3). **N** correct at position 5.
- **Guess 4 (""eikon"")**: Confirmed **O** absent. **E** present (not position 1). **I** correct at position 2. **K** correct at position 3. **N** correct at position 5.  

### Key Deductions
1. **Fixed letters/positions**:  
   - Position 2: **I** (correct from Guess 4).  
   - Position 3: **K** (correct from Guess 4).  
   - Position 5: **N** (confirmed in multiple guesses).  
2. **E's position**:  
   - E is present but ruled out of positions 1 (Guess 4), 2 (Guess 3), 3 (Guess 2), and 5 (Guess 1).  
   - **Position 4 must be E** (last remaining position).  
3. **Word structure**:  
   - Secret word: **[?] I K E N**  
     - Position 1: Unknown letter.  
     - Positions 2–5: Fixed as I, K, E, N.  
4. **Absent letters**: C, R, A, S, T, D, G, O (cannot be used).  
5. **Remaining possibilities for position 1**:  
   - Must be a letter not in absent list and not a duplicate (E/I/K/N already placed).  
   - Options: B, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  
   - **Only valid English word**: **""LIKEN""** (L-I-K-E-N).  
     - Meaning: To compare or represent as similar.  
     - Validly uses L (untested, not absent).  

### Final Guess: ""LIKEN""
This guess uses:
- **Position 1**: L (tests the only unknown).  
- **Positions 2–5**: I, K, E, N (all confirmed placements).  

If correct, feedback will show L(✓), I(✓), K(✓), E(✓), N(✓).  

<guess>liken</guess>",liken,"We are given feedback for four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(-)
Meaning: C, R, A are absent. N is present but not at position 4. E is present but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""stein"" -> S(x) T(x) E(-) I(-) N(✓)
Meaning: S, T are absent. E is present but not at position 3. I is present but not at position 4. N is correct at position 5.

Guess 3: ""deign"" -> D(x) E(-) I(-) G(x) N(✓)
Meaning: D, G are absent. E is present but not at position 2. I is present but not at position 3. N is correct at position 5.

Guess 4: ""eikon"" -> E(-) I(✓) K(✓) O(x) N(✓)
Meaning: 
- E is present but not at position 1 (since it was at position 1 and marked '-'). 
- I is correct at position 2 (so position 2 is I). 
- K is correct at position 3 (so position 3 is K). 
- O is absent (so O is not in the word). 
- N is correct at position 5 (confirmed). 

Now, combining all feedback:

- Absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, D, G, O
- Present letters: E, I, K, N
- Fixed positions:
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 3: K
  - Position 5: N
- E is present but not in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (from guesses: not 5 from guess1, not 3 from guess2, not 2 from guess3, not 1 from guess4). Therefore, E must be in position 4? Because that is the only position left? Positions are 1,2,3,4,5. We fixed 3 positions: 2,3,5. So positions 1 and 4 are open? But E has been ruled out from positions 1,2,3,5? So E must be in position 4? 

But position 2 is I, position 3 is K, position 5 is N. So we have:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: I (fixed)
Position 3: K (fixed)
Position 4: ?
Position 5: N (fixed)

We know E is present? And must be somewhere? Since E is not in positions 1,2,3,5, it must be in position 4?

Yes. Therefore, position 4 must be E.

So the secret word is: ? I K E N

We have to find the first letter. 

We know the first letter must not be any of the absent letters: C, R, A, S, T, D, G, O. And also not I, K, E, N? Because we are assuming no duplicates? Because so far, we haven't had any duplicate feedback? So we assume the first letter is a new letter? That is not in the absent list and not E, I, K, N? 

Present letters: E, I, K, N. So we have four letters? But the word must have five? So we need one more letter? Which must be in position 1? 

So we need a letter that:
- Is not in the absent list (C, R, A, S, T, D, G, O)
- Is not E, I, K, N (assuming no duplicates)
- Forms a valid English word.

Possible letters for position 1: from the remaining alphabet? 

Remaining letters: B, F, H, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.? 

We can try to form words: _ I K E N

Possible words:
- ""BIKEN"" — not common? 
- ""FIKEN"" — not common? 
- ""HIKEN"" — not common? 
- ""LIKEN"" — meaning: to compare. Valid word? Yes: L-I-K-E-N.
- ""MIKEN"" — not common.
- ""PIKEN"" — not common? 
- ""WIKEN"" — not common?
- ""VIKEN"" — not common?

The most common word is ""LIKEN"".

Check: ""LIKEN"" — L, I, K, E, N.

We haven't tested L? So it is not in the absent list? So it's possible? 

Could there be others? Like ""MINKE""? But that has M and E? But the pattern is ? I K E N? And M at position1? Then ""minen"" is not a word? We need exactly ? I K E N.

Another option? ""WIKEN"" not? 

So ""LIKEN"" is a valid word: L-I-K-E-N.

We can test L? If L is in the word? But we don't know? But since we have only one position left? And we know the letters? We can try ""LIKEN""? 

But we have to check if L is absent? But we haven't had feedback that L is absent? So it might be present? 

But the word is almost determined? We know four positions: 2:I, 3:K, 4:E, 5:N? And only position1 is unknown? So the word is XIKEN? 

Possible words: we listed ""LIKEN"". Are there others? 

""BIKEN""? Not common? 
""PIKEN""? Not common? 

In English, ""liken"" is a word? Yes: liken meaning to represent as similar. 

So we can guess ""LIKEN""? 

But note: we have only one guess left? We have used 4 guesses? And we have 6 tries? So we have tries left? But this might be the solution? 

Alternatively, we can confirm? 

So we guess ""LIKEN"". 

But let's see feedback? 

Alternatively, if there is another possibility? Could E be duplicated? But we have position4 as E? And E is also elsewhere? But we ruled out E in other positions? So no? 

Similarly, the first letter must be a letter not blocked? 

So I think ""LIKEN"" is the candidate? 

Therefore, we guess ""LIKEN"".
