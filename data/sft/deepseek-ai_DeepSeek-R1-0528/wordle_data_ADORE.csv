We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
   - It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position)

 So, we know:
  - The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
  - The letters R and A are in the word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 2 and 3 respectively).
  - The letters C and N are not in the word.

 Since E is at the end, the word ends with E.

 We also know that R and A are present, but not in positions 2 and 3.

 We must avoid using C and N in our next guess.

 Let's think of a word that:
  - Ends with E (so position 5 is E)
  - Contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 (for R) and 2 and 3 (for A) — actually, we don't know the positions yet, but we know they are not in the positions we used in the first guess for those letters.

 Also, we have to avoid C and N.

 We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 Since R and A are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Let me try to think of words ending with E that contain R and A.

 Some possibilities: 
  - R could be at the beginning? But we don't know. We can try to put R in position 1 or 4, and A in position 1, 3, or 4? But note we have to avoid positions 2 and 3 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3.

 However, note: the feedback for R was at position 2 and it was wrong position, so R can be in 1,3,4, or 5? But position 5 is E, so R cannot be there. So R can be in 1,3,4.

 Similarly, A was at position 3 and was wrong, so A can be in 1,2,4,5? But 5 is E, so A can be in 1,2,4.

 We also know the word has 5 letters.

 Let me try to form a word that has:
   - E at the end (position 5)
   - R in one of positions 1,3,4
   - A in one of positions 1,2,4

 And we must avoid C and N.

 We can also try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like T, S, L, etc.) to get more information.

 I think a good strategy is to try a word that uses as many new letters as possible (to get more information) while including the known letters (R, A, E) and avoiding the absent ones (C, N).

 Let me try to think of words ending in E that have R and A.

 Example: 
   ""RANGE"" -> but we know N is absent, so no.
   ""GRAPE"" -> G is new, R is at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2? Actually, wait: in our first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So in ""GRAPE"", if we put R at position 2 again, that would be the same position. We should avoid putting R at position 2 again because we know it's not there. Similarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 So in ""GRAPE"":
   G at 1 (new)
   R at 2 (but we know R is not at position 2, so we shouldn't put it there again) -> so this is not a good choice.

 We need a word that has R in a new position (1,3, or 4) and A in a new position (1,2, or 4).

 Let me try ""RAISE"": 
   R at 1 (new position for R, which is allowed because we haven't tried position 1 for R)
   A at 2 (new position for A, because we only tried position 3 and now we try 2)
   I at 3 (new letter)
   S at 4 (new letter)
   E at 5 (known)

 But note: we have to check if the word is valid. ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

 However, we are avoiding C and N, which we do.

 But wait: we also know that the word has an A and R, and we are including them. Also, we are testing new letters (I, S).

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROAST"", but we know that we have to avoid C and N? Actually, we don't have C or N in ""ROAST"", but we have O, S, T. However, we also have E at the end? No, ""ROAST"" ends with T, not E. So that doesn't work.

 Another idea: ""PARSE"":
   P at 1 (new)
   A at 2 (new position for A, since we tried 3 and now 2)
   R at 3 (new position for R, we tried 2 and now 3)
   S at 4 (new)
   E at 5 (known)

 This seems good.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any known absent letters. We know C and N are absent, and ""PARSE"" doesn't have them.

 However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any information about duplicates. But in the feedback, we didn't have any duplicate in the first guess, so we don't know.

 But ""PARSE"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ARISE"": 
   A at 1 (new position for A, we tried 3 and now 1)
   R at 2 (but we already know R is not at position 2) -> so we cannot put R at 2 again because we know it's not there. So that would be a waste.

 So we must avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

 Therefore, ""RAISE"" is acceptable because:
   R is at 1 (which is a new position, not 2)
   A is at 2 (which is a new position, not 3)

 Similarly, ""PARSE"" is acceptable.

 But note: in ""RAISE"", we are putting A at position 2. We don't know if A is at position 2 or not, so we can test it.

 However, we have two known letters (R and A) and we are including them, and we are testing new letters (I, S) and we have E at the end.

 I think ""RAISE"" is a good candidate.

 But let me check: we also have to consider that the word might have the letter A at position 2? We don't know, so we can test.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't put A and R in positions we already know are wrong? Actually, we are allowed to test new positions.

 Another candidate: ""TRACE"" -> but we know C is absent, so no.

 ""SLATE"" -> but we know A is in the word, but we are putting A at position 3? We know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know from the first guess that when we put A at position 3, it was present but wrong position. So we can try A at position 3 again? No, because we know it's not at position 3. So we should avoid putting A at position 3 again.

 In ""SLATE"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same position we already know is wrong. So we shouldn't do that.

 Therefore, we need a word that has A in position 1, 2, or 4.

 Similarly, R in position 1, 3, or 4.

 So let me list some words ending in E that have R and A, and avoid C and N, and put A and R in new positions.

 Words:
   ""BRAVE"": 
      B at 1 (new)
      R at 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at 2 again. So skip.
   ""FRAME"": 
      F at 1 (new)
      R at 2 -> again, position 2 for R is not allowed. Skip.
   ""GRACE"": has C -> skip.
   ""PRICE"": has C -> skip.
   ""TRADE"": has D (new) and E at the end. 
        T at 1 (new)
        R at 2 -> not allowed. Skip.
   ""CRANE"": we already tried.

 How about ""AROSE""? 
   A at 1 (new position for A, we tried 3 and now 1) -> allowed
   R at 2 -> not allowed (we know R is not at 2) -> so skip.

 How about ""RAPID""? Doesn't end with E.

 How about ""RAZED""? 
   R at 1 (allowed)
   A at 2 (allowed, because we haven't tried A at 2) 
   Z at 3 (new)
   E at 4? But we need E at 5. This word ends with D? No, ""RAZED"" is R-A-Z-E-D? Wait, that's 5 letters: R (1), A (2), Z (3), E (4), D (5). But we need E at 5. So no.

 How about ""RACES"": has C -> skip.

 How about ""PARSE"": 
   P at 1 (new)
   A at 2 (new position for A, we tried 3 and now 2) -> allowed
   R at 3 (new position for R, we tried 2 and now 3) -> allowed
   S at 4 (new)
   E at 5 (known)

 This seems good.

 Another: ""RAISE"": 
   R at 1 (allowed)
   A at 2 (allowed)
   I at 3 (new)
   S at 4 (new)
   E at 5 (known)

 Both ""PARSE"" and ""RAISE"" are good.

 I think I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it uses more vowels and common consonants.

 But note: we are also trying to get information about other letters. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess). So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we know C and N are absent, so we can avoid them. We also know R, A, E are present.

 In ""RAISE"", we are using R, A, I, S, E. We are testing I and S.

 In ""PARSE"", we are using P, A, R, S, E. We are testing P and S.

 Both are good. I think I'll choose ""RAISE"".

 But wait: we know that the word has an E at the end, and we are including that. We are also including R and A in new positions.

 Let me check: the word must have R, A, and E. And two more letters that are not C or N.

 So, guess: ""RAISE""

<guess>raise</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (✓).
- **R** and **A** are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively (-).
- **C** and **N** are not in the word (x).

Key insights:
1. The secret word ends with **E**.
2. **R** must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is invalid and position 5 is E).
3. **A** must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is invalid and position 5 is E).
4. Avoid **C** and **N** entirely.

For the next guess, I prioritized:
- Testing **R** and **A** in new valid positions.
- Including new common letters (**I**, **S**) to gather more information.
- Ensuring the word ends with **E**.

""RAISE"" fits perfectly:
- **R** in position 1 (new valid position).
- **A** in position 2 (new valid position).
- **I** and **S** are new letters to test.
- **E** in position 5 (confirmed correct).
- No **C** or **N**.

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities while maximizing new information.

- **C** and **N** are not in the word (x).

Key insights:
1. The secret word ends with **E**.
2. **R** must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is invalid and position 5 is E).
3. **A** must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is invalid and position 5 is E).
4. Avoid **C** and **N** entirely.

For the next guess, I prioritized:
- Testing **R** and **A** in new valid positions.
- Including new common letters (**I**, **S**) to gather more information.
- Ensuring the word ends with **E**.

""RAISE"" fits perfectly:
- **R** in position 1 (new valid position).
- **A** in position 2 (new valid position).
- **I** and **S** are new letters to test.
- **E** in position 5 (confirmed correct).
- No **C** or **N**.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,ADORE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
   - It doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: - (in the word but wrong position)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: x (not in the word)
  E: ✓ (correct position)

 So, we know:
  - The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
  - The letters R and A are in the word, but not in the positions we guessed (position 2 and 3 respectively).
  - The letters C and N are not in the word.

 Since E is at the end, the word ends with E.

 We also know that R and A are present, but not in positions 2 and 3.

 We must avoid using C and N in our next guess.

 Let's think of a word that:
  - Ends with E (so position 5 is E)
  - Contains R and A, but not in positions 2 and 3 (for R) and 2 and 3 (for A) — actually, we don't know the positions yet, but we know they are not in the positions we used in the first guess for those letters.

 Also, we have to avoid C and N.

 We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 Since R and A are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Let me try to think of words ending with E that contain R and A.

 Some possibilities: 
  - R could be at the beginning? But we don't know. We can try to put R in position 1 or 4, and A in position 1, 3, or 4? But note we have to avoid positions 2 and 3 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was that it is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3.

 However, note: the feedback for R was at position 2 and it was wrong position, so R can be in 1,3,4, or 5? But position 5 is E, so R cannot be there. So R can be in 1,3,4.

 Similarly, A was at position 3 and was wrong, so A can be in 1,2,4,5? But 5 is E, so A can be in 1,2,4.

 We also know the word has 5 letters.

 Let me try to form a word that has:
   - E at the end (position 5)
   - R in one of positions 1,3,4
   - A in one of positions 1,2,4

 And we must avoid C and N.

 We can also try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like T, S, L, etc.) to get more information.

 I think a good strategy is to try a word that uses as many new letters as possible (to get more information) while including the known letters (R, A, E) and avoiding the absent ones (C, N).

 Let me try to think of words ending in E that have R and A.

 Example: 
   ""RANGE"" -> but we know N is absent, so no.
   ""GRAPE"" -> G is new, R is at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2? Actually, wait: in our first guess, R was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So in ""GRAPE"", if we put R at position 2 again, that would be the same position. We should avoid putting R at position 2 again because we know it's not there. Similarly, we should avoid putting A at position 3.

 So in ""GRAPE"":
   G at 1 (new)
   R at 2 (but we know R is not at position 2, so we shouldn't put it there again) -> so this is not a good choice.

 We need a word that has R in a new position (1,3, or 4) and A in a new position (1,2, or 4).

 Let me try ""RAISE"": 
   R at 1 (new position for R, which is allowed because we haven't tried position 1 for R)
   A at 2 (new position for A, because we only tried position 3 and now we try 2)
   I at 3 (new letter)
   S at 4 (new letter)
   E at 5 (known)

 But note: we have to check if the word is valid. ""RAISE"" is a valid word.

 However, we are avoiding C and N, which we do.

 But wait: we also know that the word has an A and R, and we are including them. Also, we are testing new letters (I, S).

 Alternatively, we could try ""ROAST"", but we know that we have to avoid C and N? Actually, we don't have C or N in ""ROAST"", but we have O, S, T. However, we also have E at the end? No, ""ROAST"" ends with T, not E. So that doesn't work.

 Another idea: ""PARSE"":
   P at 1 (new)
   A at 2 (new position for A, since we tried 3 and now 2)
   R at 3 (new position for R, we tried 2 and now 3)
   S at 4 (new)
   E at 5 (known)

 This seems good.

 But note: we have to make sure we don't use any known absent letters. We know C and N are absent, and ""PARSE"" doesn't have them.

 However, we also have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any information about duplicates. But in the feedback, we didn't have any duplicate in the first guess, so we don't know.

 But ""PARSE"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""ARISE"": 
   A at 1 (new position for A, we tried 3 and now 1)
   R at 2 (but we already know R is not at position 2) -> so we cannot put R at 2 again because we know it's not there. So that would be a waste.

 So we must avoid putting R at position 2 and A at position 3.

 Therefore, ""RAISE"" is acceptable because:
   R is at 1 (which is a new position, not 2)
   A is at 2 (which is a new position, not 3)

 Similarly, ""PARSE"" is acceptable.

 But note: in ""RAISE"", we are putting A at position 2. We don't know if A is at position 2 or not, so we can test it.

 However, we have two known letters (R and A) and we are including them, and we are testing new letters (I, S) and we have E at the end.

 I think ""RAISE"" is a good candidate.

 But let me check: we also have to consider that the word might have the letter A at position 2? We don't know, so we can test.

 Alternatively, we can try to use a word that doesn't put A and R in positions we already know are wrong? Actually, we are allowed to test new positions.

 Another candidate: ""TRACE"" -> but we know C is absent, so no.

 ""SLATE"" -> but we know A is in the word, but we are putting A at position 3? We know A is not at position 3? Actually, we know from the first guess that when we put A at position 3, it was present but wrong position. So we can try A at position 3 again? No, because we know it's not at position 3. So we should avoid putting A at position 3 again.

 In ""SLATE"", if we put A at position 3, that would be the same position we already know is wrong. So we shouldn't do that.

 Therefore, we need a word that has A in position 1, 2, or 4.

 Similarly, R in position 1, 3, or 4.

 So let me list some words ending in E that have R and A, and avoid C and N, and put A and R in new positions.

 Words:
   ""BRAVE"": 
      B at 1 (new)
      R at 2 -> but we know R is not at position 2? So we cannot put R at 2 again. So skip.
   ""FRAME"": 
      F at 1 (new)
      R at 2 -> again, position 2 for R is not allowed. Skip.
   ""GRACE"": has C -> skip.
   ""PRICE"": has C -> skip.
   ""TRADE"": has D (new) and E at the end. 
        T at 1 (new)
        R at 2 -> not allowed. Skip.
   ""CRANE"": we already tried.

 How about ""AROSE""? 
   A at 1 (new position for A, we tried 3 and now 1) -> allowed
   R at 2 -> not allowed (we know R is not at 2) -> so skip.

 How about ""RAPID""? Doesn't end with E.

 How about ""RAZED""? 
   R at 1 (allowed)
   A at 2 (allowed, because we haven't tried A at 2) 
   Z at 3 (new)
   E at 4? But we need E at 5. This word ends with D? No, ""RAZED"" is R-A-Z-E-D? Wait, that's 5 letters: R (1), A (2), Z (3), E (4), D (5). But we need E at 5. So no.

 How about ""RACES"": has C -> skip.

 How about ""PARSE"": 
   P at 1 (new)
   A at 2 (new position for A, we tried 3 and now 2) -> allowed
   R at 3 (new position for R, we tried 2 and now 3) -> allowed
   S at 4 (new)
   E at 5 (known)

 This seems good.

 Another: ""RAISE"": 
   R at 1 (allowed)
   A at 2 (allowed)
   I at 3 (new)
   S at 4 (new)
   E at 5 (known)

 Both ""PARSE"" and ""RAISE"" are good.

 I think I'll go with ""RAISE"" because it uses more vowels and common consonants.

 But note: we are also trying to get information about other letters. We have already used: C, R, A, N, E (from first guess). So we have 21 letters left to test? Actually, we know C and N are absent, so we can avoid them. We also know R, A, E are present.

 In ""RAISE"", we are using R, A, I, S, E. We are testing I and S.

 In ""PARSE"", we are using P, A, R, S, E. We are testing P and S.

 Both are good. I think I'll choose ""RAISE"".

 But wait: we know that the word has an E at the end, and we are including that. We are also including R and A in new positions.

 Let me check: the word must have R, A, and E. And two more letters that are not C or N.

 So, guess: ""RAISE""

<guess>raise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **E** is correct and in position 5 (✓).
- **R** and **A** are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively (-).
- **C** and **N** are not in the word (x).

Key insights:
1. The secret word ends with **E**.
2. **R** must be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is invalid and position 5 is E).
3. **A** must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is invalid and position 5 is E).
4. Avoid **C** and **N** entirely.

  - A is in the word but not in position 2 (because we placed A at position 2 and got '-', so it's present but not in position 2).
  - I and S are not in the word (x).

So now we know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
- The word contains R and A, but:
  - R is not in position 1 (from guess 2) nor position 2 (from guess 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.
  - A is not in position 3 (from guess 1) nor position 2 (from guess 2). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4.
- The word does not contain: C, N, I, S (from both guesses).
- Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, S. Of these, only R, A, E are confirmed to be in the word.

We need to form a word that:
  - Ends with E.
  - Contains R and A, with R in position 3 or 4, and A in position 1 or 4.
  - Does not contain C, N, I, S.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's consider possible positions:

Case 1: A in position 1 and R in position 3 or 4.
Case 2: A in position 4 and R in position 3 or 4. But note: if both A and R are in position 4, that's impossible. So:
  - If A is at 4, R can be at 3.
  - If A is at 1, R can be at 3 or 4.

Also, we have two more letters to place (position 2 and the one between R and E if R is at 3, or position 3 if R is at 4?).

Let's break down:

The word has positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (with 5=E).

If A is in position 1:
  - Position 1: A
  - Position 2: ? (unknown, must be a new letter, not C,N,I,S)
  - Position 3: ? (could be R or another letter) or if R is in position 4, then position 3 is another letter.
  - Position 4: R (if R is in position 4) or if R is in position 3, then position 4 is another letter.

If A is in position 4:
  - Then position 4: A
  - Then R must be in position 3 (since position 4 is taken by A, and R cannot be in position 1 or 2, so only position 3 left).
  - Position 1: ? (unknown letter)
  - Position 2: ? (unknown letter)
  - Position 3: R
  - Position 4: A
  - Position 5: E

So two scenarios:

Scenario A: A at 1, R at 3 or 4.
  - If R at 3: word could be A _ R _ E
  - If R at 4: word could be A _ _ R E

Scenario B: A at 4, then R must be at 3: so word must be _ _ R A E

We need to think of words that fit these patterns and avoid the forbidden letters.

Let's list possible words:

First, Scenario B: words of the form _ _ R A E
  - The first two letters can be many, but we avoid C,N,I,S and also we know R and A are already placed so no repetition unless noted? But we don't know about duplicates.
  - Possible letters: let's think of common letters that haven't been tested: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.
  - Example words:
      - ""OAR"" + ""AE"" -> no, that would be ""OARAE"" -> invalid.
      - We need real words: something like ""BORAE""? No, ""BORAE"" isn't a word.
      - ""GRAZE"" -> but Z is a letter, and note we have E at end? ""GRAZE"" is G R A Z E -> positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 4=Z, 5=E -> but this has R at position 2, which we know is invalid! Because R cannot be at position 2 (from guess1). And in this scenario, R must be at position 3? In our scenario B, R is at 3 and A at 4. So the word would be _ _ R A E -> so positions: 1,2, R at 3, A at 4, E at 5. So ""GRAZE"" would be G(1), R(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5) -> but that doesn't match our pattern because then A is at position 3, but we have A at position 4? So it doesn't fit.

  Actually, for Scenario B: the word must be: 
      position1: ? 
      position2: ?
      position3: R
      position4: A
      position5: E

  So the letters in positions 1 and 2 are any letters (not forbidden) and they must form a word with ""R"" at position 3, ""A"" at 4, and ""E"" at 5.

  Example: 
      ""UMRAE""? -> not a word.
      ""OPRAE""? not a word.

  Let me think of real words: 
      ""FRA"" can be part? But at positions 3,4: R and A. We need the last letter to be E? The word is ...? 

  How about ""BERAE""? No, not a word.

  Alternatively: 
      ""DRA"" is not, because that would put R at position 2? Not allowed.

  How about ""AREA""? But that has A at the start and end? But we are in scenario B: we need position4=A. And position3=R. Then we have ""?? R A E"". 

  Words ending in ""RAE"" are uncommon. Let's try:
      ""CRAE"" -> not a word, and C is forbidden.
      ""BRAE"" -> ""BRAE"" is a word? It means a steep bank. Yes, it's valid.

  ""BRAE"": 
      B at 1, R at 2? But wait: in ""BRAE"", the letters are:
        B (position1), R (position2), A (position3)? But we need position3=R and position4=A. 

  In ""BRAE"", which is 5 letters? No, BRAE is 4 letters: B-R-A-E. We need 5 letters.

  So let's try 5-letter words: 
      ""ABRAE"" is not a word.

  How about ""UPRAE""? Doesn't exist.

  Another: ""METRAE""? No.

  This scenario seems difficult. Maybe there are no common words? Let me skip for now and try scenario A.

Scenario A: 
  Option 1: A at 1 and R at 3 -> word: A _ R _ E
  Then position 2 and position 4 are two letters.

  Option 2: A at 1 and R at 4 -> word: A _ _ R E

For Option 1: A _ R _ E
  We need a letter at position 2 and 4, both not forbidden (so not C,N,I,S), and the word must be valid.

  Common letters: T, O, L, D, etc.

  Examples:
      ""AORIE""? Not a word.
      ""AERIE"" -> but note: A would be at position 1, E at position 2? But E must be at position 5? Actually, E is only confirmed at position 5. But we know E is not necessarily in other positions? However, in ""AERIE"": 
          A (1), E (2), R (3), I (4), E (5). 
        We have E at position 2 and 5. But I (at position 4) is forbidden? (we know I is not in the word from guess2). So this word has I? So invalid because I is present? No: feedback said I is not in the word, so the word has no I. So ""AERIE"" is not allowed because it has I? Actually, ""AERIE"" has E at position 2? And we know that the word must have E only at position 5? Or can it have E elsewhere? The feedback from the first guess: E was at position 5 and correct. But that doesn't necessarily mean that E cannot be used elsewhere? However, we don't know. So it might be duplicated. But we have no information about duplicates. So ""AERIE"" would be invalid because it contains the letter I? And we know I is not in the word? Yes: guess2 said I is not present. So we cannot have I. Therefore, ""AERIE"" is invalid.

  Another word: ""AUDRE""? Not a word.

  ""ALARM"" -> doesn't end with E? No.

  ""AWARE"": 
      A(1), W(2), A(3)? Wait, we have two A's? But we don't know. But ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> positions: 
        1: A
        2: W
        3: A -> but we are putting R at position 3? No, in this word R is at position 4. So it doesn't fit Option 1 (which requires R at position 3).

  Option 1 requires R at position 3.

  So let's think: words starting with A, third letter R, last letter E.

  Example: ""AARVE"" -> not a word.

  ""ABRLE"" -> not a word.

  ""ACR"" -> but C is forbidden.

  ""ADORE"": 
      A(1), D(2), O(3)-> but we need R at position 3? So no.

  So Option 1 doesn't yield common words? Let me try Option 2.

Option 2: A _ _ R E
  Positions: 1: A, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: E

  So words like ""A??R E"". 

  Examples:
      ""ANGRE""? No, and N is forbidden.
      ""AMORE"": A, M, O, R, E -> that's a valid word? It's an Italian word, but might be accepted? But also, we are avoiding forbidden letters: no C,N,I,S. M and O are new. But let's check: positions: 
          1: A (we know A should be at position 1? Actually, we are testing if A can be at position 1? And we know A is present and not at position 2 or 3, so position 1 is possible.
          2: M (new)
          3: O (new)
          4: R (which we know must be at 3 or 4, so 4 is good)
          5: E (correct)

      But ""AMORE"" is a valid English word? It means love, taken from Italian, but it might be accepted. 

  Another: ""ABORE""? Not a word.

  ""ALTERE""? Not 5 letters.

  ""ADORE"": 
      A, D, O, R, E -> positions: 
          1: A
          2: D
          3: O
          4: R -> yes, so R at 4? That matches what we need.
          5: E

      ""ADORE"" is a valid word. We must check forbidden letters: no C,N,I,S? So D,O are new and allowed.

  ""ADORE"" is a valid option.

  Similarly, ""AROSE"": but we know from guess2 that A would be at position1? And then ""AROSE"" is A, R, O, S, E? But we know S is forbidden (from guess2: S is not in the word). So ""AROSE"" has S at position4? Forbidden.

  ""AGRE"" -> too short.

  ""AFIRE"": has I and E at the end? ""AFIRE"" is A, F, I, R, E -> but I is forbidden. So no.

  ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> but this has two A's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Moreover, we are placing R at position4? Yes: R at4. But in ""AWARE"", position3 is A? We are putting a letter at position3 which is A? We don't know if the word has two A's? But wait: we only know one A is present? Actually, no: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. For example, the word could have two R's? But we haven't seen that.

  In any case, ""AWARE"" has S? No: spelling is A-W-A-R-E? So letters: A, W, A, R, E. Then no S? But I is not in there? And S is forbidden? So forbidden only means we can't use those letters? No: we know the word doesn't have I and S, so if ""AWARE"" has I or S? It doesn't. However, ""AWARE"" does not contain S? Wait: is that right? Yes, no S.

  But now, we have a potential problem: in guess2, we tried RAISE and got R(-) and A(-). That means R and A are each in the word but in other positions. It doesn't specify how many. So the word might have two A's? Then in ""AWARE"", we have A at position1 and position3. We are testing A at position1? But we don't know if that is allowed? Actually, we are allowed to put A at position1? Because we have only forbidden position2 and 3 for A? But position1 is new. So it's okay.

  So ""AWARE"": 
      A(1): we don't know if it's correct or not? We'll test.
      W(2): new
      A(3): but we know A is not at position3? From guess1: we had A at position3 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but not at position3. So if the word has two A's, then one of them is at position3? No: if the word has two A's, then it could have one at position3? But then when we put A at position3 in guess1, we would expect a ✓? Or if the word has two A's, and one is at position3, then the feedback would have marked A at position3 as present and correct? Yes: if a letter is in the correct position, it gets ✓ regardless of duplicates.

  Therefore, since in guess1 A was at position3 and we got '-' (present but wrong position), it must be that A is not at position3. So the word either has one A that is not at position3, or two A's but none at position3? Yes. So if ""AWARE"" has an A at position3, that would be contradictory because guess1's feedback said A is not at position3. So ""AWARE"" cannot be the secret word because it has A at position3? Exactly.

  Therefore, we cannot use words that put A at position3? And in fact, we know A is not at position3.

  So for scenario A with R at position4: we have word A _ _ R E. The third position (position3) cannot be A? So we must have a distinct letter at position3 that isn't A? Which is already required.

  So ""ADORE"": A, D, O, R, E -> position1: A, position2: D, position3: O, position4: R, position5: E. 
  This doesn't put A at position3? Correct. So it's acceptable.

  Similarly, ""AMORE"": A, M, O, R, E -> position3 is O? Not A, so acceptable? But does it have any forbidden letter? No.

  Now back to Scenario B: _ _ R A E? We were struggling to find words. But let me think: 
      ""WHERE"": H at1, E at2? Wait, but E is at position2? And we have E at position5. Then ""WHERE"" is W-H-E-R-E? That doesn't match _ _ R A E. We need position3=R, position4=A? But in ""WHERE"", position4=R? And then position5=E? Doesn't have A? So no.

  ""BRAVE"": B, R, A, V, E -> positions: 
        1: B
        2: R -> but we know R cannot be at position2! Forbidden. So no.

  How about ""DRAKE"": D at1, R at2 -> not allowed.

  What about ""TRA"""" but then we need position3=R? Then we have _ _ R A E? 
      ""UMRAE""? Not a word.
      ""GRA"": no, 5 letters? So it's difficult.

  Alternatively, we can consider: maybe Scenario B doesn't have any common words? So we focus on Scenario A with Option 2: A at position1 and R at position4.

We have ""ADORE"" and ""AMORE"" as candidates.

But we should also consider if A could be at position4? Then R must be at position3? And then the word must be _ _ R A E? Words like ""LARAE""? Not a word. ""BARGE"" but ends with E? ""BARGE"" is B,A,R,G,E -> position1=B,2=A,3=R,4=G,5=E? Then position2=A? But we know A cannot be at position2? From guess2: A was tried at position2 and was marked '-' meaning A is present but not at position2? So the word cannot have A at position2? So any word with A at position2 is invalid.

Therefore, scenario B is problematic because it requires R at position3 and A at position4? Then positions 1 and 2? But what about ""OATER""? Not a common word. ""YARES"" -> has S? Forbidden.

So perhaps Scenario B is unlikely? So we'll focus on Scenario A Option 2: A _ _ R E.

Best words: ""ADORE"" and ""AMORE"". Also ""ARMORE""? Not 5.

Other words: 
    ""ATONE"": has N -> forbidden.
    ""ALONE"": has L and O? But N is forbidden.
    ""ABHOR"": doesn't end with E? No.

    ""ADORE"" is a solid choice.

But also: ""AMPLE"" -> doesn't have R? Required.

So we must include R? So only words that include both A and R? And the pattern.

Another word: ""ABORE"" is not valid? ""ABORE"" not a word.

""APIRE"": A, P, I, R, E -> but I is forbidden.

So ""ADORE"" is a good option.

We also want to test more new letters? In ""ADORE"", we are testing D and O? They haven't been tested yet.

Therefore, let's guess ""ADORE"".

But note: we are guessing ""ADORE"" to get information? Or we can think of a word that covers more possibilities? However, since we have limited choices, it's a good candidate.

Alternatively, we could try a word that might fit scenario B? But we don't think there is one? So let's go with ""ADORE"".

So our guess is ""ADORE"".

<guess>adore</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane**: E is correct at position 5 (✓), R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (-), C and N are absent (x).
2. **raise**: E is confirmed again at position 5 (✓), R and A are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (-), I and S are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
- **Position 5 is E** (fixed).
- **R must be in position 3 or 4** (excluded from positions 1, 2).
- **A must be in position 1 or 4** (excluded from positions 2, 3).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, I, S.
- The word **must include R and A** in valid positions.

After eliminating scenarios where A and R conflict (e.g., both in position 4) or words with absent letters, the most plausible pattern is **A _ _ R E**:
- **A** in position 1.
- **R** in position 4.
- Position 2 and 3 are unknown (must be new letters not in {C, N, I, S}).

**ADORE** fits perfectly:
- A at position 1 (testing valid A position).
- R at position 4 (testing valid R position).
- New letters: **D** (position 2) and **O** (position 3) to gather more information.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, N, I, S) and adheres to the feedback.

This guess efficiently tests remaining possibilities while prioritizing new letters.

<guess>adore</guess>",adore,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(- N(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
  - E is in the word and in position 5 (correct).
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C and N are not in the word.

Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(✓)
This tells us:
  - E is again correct in position 5 (we already knew that).
  - R is in the word but not in position 1 (because we placed R at position 1 and got '-', meaning it's present but wrong position).
  - A is in the word but not in position 2 (because we placed A at position 2 and got '-', so it's present but not in position 2).
  - I and S are not in the word (x).

So now we know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
- The word contains R and A, but:
  - R is not in position 1 (from guess 2) nor position 2 (from guess 1). Therefore, R must be in position 3 or 4.
  - A is not in position 3 (from guess 1) nor position 2 (from guess 2). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4.
- The word does not contain: C, N, I, S (from both guesses).
- Also, we have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, I, S. Of these, only R, A, E are confirmed to be in the word.

We need to form a word that:
  - Ends with E.
  - Contains R and A, with R in position 3 or 4, and A in position 1 or 4.
  - Does not contain C, N, I, S.

We also want to test new letters to get more information.

Let's consider possible positions:

Case 1: A in position 1 and R in position 3 or 4.
Case 2: A in position 4 and R in position 3 or 4. But note: if both A and R are in position 4, that's impossible. So:
  - If A is at 4, R can be at 3.
  - If A is at 1, R can be at 3 or 4.

Also, we have two more letters to place (position 2 and the one between R and E if R is at 3, or position 3 if R is at 4?).

Let's break down:

The word has positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (with 5=E).

If A is in position 1:
  - Position 1: A
  - Position 2: ? (unknown, must be a new letter, not C,N,I,S)
  - Position 3: ? (could be R or another letter) or if R is in position 4, then position 3 is another letter.
  - Position 4: R (if R is in position 4) or if R is in position 3, then position 4 is another letter.

If A is in position 4:
  - Then position 4: A
  - Then R must be in position 3 (since position 4 is taken by A, and R cannot be in position 1 or 2, so only position 3 left).
  - Position 1: ? (unknown letter)
  - Position 2: ? (unknown letter)
  - Position 3: R
  - Position 4: A
  - Position 5: E

So two scenarios:

Scenario A: A at 1, R at 3 or 4.
  - If R at 3: word could be A _ R _ E
  - If R at 4: word could be A _ _ R E

Scenario B: A at 4, then R must be at 3: so word must be _ _ R A E

We need to think of words that fit these patterns and avoid the forbidden letters.

Let's list possible words:

First, Scenario B: words of the form _ _ R A E
  - The first two letters can be many, but we avoid C,N,I,S and also we know R and A are already placed so no repetition unless noted? But we don't know about duplicates.
  - Possible letters: let's think of common letters that haven't been tested: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,O,P,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.
  - Example words:
      - ""OAR"" + ""AE"" -> no, that would be ""OARAE"" -> invalid.
      - We need real words: something like ""BORAE""? No, ""BORAE"" isn't a word.
      - ""GRAZE"" -> but Z is a letter, and note we have E at end? ""GRAZE"" is G R A Z E -> positions: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 4=Z, 5=E -> but this has R at position 2, which we know is invalid! Because R cannot be at position 2 (from guess1). And in this scenario, R must be at position 3? In our scenario B, R is at 3 and A at 4. So the word would be _ _ R A E -> so positions: 1,2, R at 3, A at 4, E at 5. So ""GRAZE"" would be G(1), R(2), A(3), Z(4), E(5) -> but that doesn't match our pattern because then A is at position 3, but we have A at position 4? So it doesn't fit.

  Actually, for Scenario B: the word must be: 
      position1: ? 
      position2: ?
      position3: R
      position4: A
      position5: E

  So the letters in positions 1 and 2 are any letters (not forbidden) and they must form a word with ""R"" at position 3, ""A"" at 4, and ""E"" at 5.

  Example: 
      ""UMRAE""? -> not a word.
      ""OPRAE""? not a word.

  Let me think of real words: 
      ""FRA"" can be part? But at positions 3,4: R and A. We need the last letter to be E? The word is ...? 

  How about ""BERAE""? No, not a word.

  Alternatively: 
      ""DRA"" is not, because that would put R at position 2? Not allowed.

  How about ""AREA""? But that has A at the start and end? But we are in scenario B: we need position4=A. And position3=R. Then we have ""?? R A E"". 

  Words ending in ""RAE"" are uncommon. Let's try:
      ""CRAE"" -> not a word, and C is forbidden.
      ""BRAE"" -> ""BRAE"" is a word? It means a steep bank. Yes, it's valid.

  ""BRAE"": 
      B at 1, R at 2? But wait: in ""BRAE"", the letters are:
        B (position1), R (position2), A (position3)? But we need position3=R and position4=A. 

  In ""BRAE"", which is 5 letters? No, BRAE is 4 letters: B-R-A-E. We need 5 letters.

  So let's try 5-letter words: 
      ""ABRAE"" is not a word.

  How about ""UPRAE""? Doesn't exist.

  Another: ""METRAE""? No.

  This scenario seems difficult. Maybe there are no common words? Let me skip for now and try scenario A.

Scenario A: 
  Option 1: A at 1 and R at 3 -> word: A _ R _ E
  Then position 2 and position 4 are two letters.

  Option 2: A at 1 and R at 4 -> word: A _ _ R E

For Option 1: A _ R _ E
  We need a letter at position 2 and 4, both not forbidden (so not C,N,I,S), and the word must be valid.

  Common letters: T, O, L, D, etc.

  Examples:
      ""AORIE""? Not a word.
      ""AERIE"" -> but note: A would be at position 1, E at position 2? But E must be at position 5? Actually, E is only confirmed at position 5. But we know E is not necessarily in other positions? However, in ""AERIE"": 
          A (1), E (2), R (3), I (4), E (5). 
        We have E at position 2 and 5. But I (at position 4) is forbidden? (we know I is not in the word from guess2). So this word has I? So invalid because I is present? No: feedback said I is not in the word, so the word has no I. So ""AERIE"" is not allowed because it has I? Actually, ""AERIE"" has E at position 2? And we know that the word must have E only at position 5? Or can it have E elsewhere? The feedback from the first guess: E was at position 5 and correct. But that doesn't necessarily mean that E cannot be used elsewhere? However, we don't know. So it might be duplicated. But we have no information about duplicates. So ""AERIE"" would be invalid because it contains the letter I? And we know I is not in the word? Yes: guess2 said I is not present. So we cannot have I. Therefore, ""AERIE"" is invalid.

  Another word: ""AUDRE""? Not a word.

  ""ALARM"" -> doesn't end with E? No.

  ""AWARE"": 
      A(1), W(2), A(3)? Wait, we have two A's? But we don't know. But ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> positions: 
        1: A
        2: W
        3: A -> but we are putting R at position 3? No, in this word R is at position 4. So it doesn't fit Option 1 (which requires R at position 3).

  Option 1 requires R at position 3.

  So let's think: words starting with A, third letter R, last letter E.

  Example: ""AARVE"" -> not a word.

  ""ABRLE"" -> not a word.

  ""ACR"" -> but C is forbidden.

  ""ADORE"": 
      A(1), D(2), O(3)-> but we need R at position 3? So no.

  So Option 1 doesn't yield common words? Let me try Option 2.

Option 2: A _ _ R E
  Positions: 1: A, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: R, 5: E

  So words like ""A??R E"". 

  Examples:
      ""ANGRE""? No, and N is forbidden.
      ""AMORE"": A, M, O, R, E -> that's a valid word? It's an Italian word, but might be accepted? But also, we are avoiding forbidden letters: no C,N,I,S. M and O are new. But let's check: positions: 
          1: A (we know A should be at position 1? Actually, we are testing if A can be at position 1? And we know A is present and not at position 2 or 3, so position 1 is possible.
          2: M (new)
          3: O (new)
          4: R (which we know must be at 3 or 4, so 4 is good)
          5: E (correct)

      But ""AMORE"" is a valid English word? It means love, taken from Italian, but it might be accepted. 

  Another: ""ABORE""? Not a word.

  ""ALTERE""? Not 5 letters.

  ""ADORE"": 
      A, D, O, R, E -> positions: 
          1: A
          2: D
          3: O
          4: R -> yes, so R at 4? That matches what we need.
          5: E

      ""ADORE"" is a valid word. We must check forbidden letters: no C,N,I,S? So D,O are new and allowed.

  ""ADORE"" is a valid option.

  Similarly, ""AROSE"": but we know from guess2 that A would be at position1? And then ""AROSE"" is A, R, O, S, E? But we know S is forbidden (from guess2: S is not in the word). So ""AROSE"" has S at position4? Forbidden.

  ""AGRE"" -> too short.

  ""AFIRE"": has I and E at the end? ""AFIRE"" is A, F, I, R, E -> but I is forbidden. So no.

  ""AWARE"": A, W, A, R, E -> but this has two A's? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Moreover, we are placing R at position4? Yes: R at4. But in ""AWARE"", position3 is A? We are putting a letter at position3 which is A? We don't know if the word has two A's? But wait: we only know one A is present? Actually, no: the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. For example, the word could have two R's? But we haven't seen that.

  In any case, ""AWARE"" has S? No: spelling is A-W-A-R-E? So letters: A, W, A, R, E. Then no S? But I is not in there? And S is forbidden? So forbidden only means we can't use those letters? No: we know the word doesn't have I and S, so if ""AWARE"" has I or S? It doesn't. However, ""AWARE"" does not contain S? Wait: is that right? Yes, no S.

  But now, we have a potential problem: in guess2, we tried RAISE and got R(-) and A(-). That means R and A are each in the word but in other positions. It doesn't specify how many. So the word might have two A's? Then in ""AWARE"", we have A at position1 and position3. We are testing A at position1? But we don't know if that is allowed? Actually, we are allowed to put A at position1? Because we have only forbidden position2 and 3 for A? But position1 is new. So it's okay.

  So ""AWARE"": 
      A(1): we don't know if it's correct or not? We'll test.
      W(2): new
      A(3): but we know A is not at position3? From guess1: we had A at position3 and it was marked as '-' meaning present but not at position3. So if the word has two A's, then one of them is at position3? No: if the word has two A's, then it could have one at position3? But then when we put A at position3 in guess1, we would expect a ✓? Or if the word has two A's, and one is at position3, then the feedback would have marked A at position3 as present and correct? Yes: if a letter is in the correct position, it gets ✓ regardless of duplicates.

  Therefore, since in guess1 A was at position3 and we got '-' (present but wrong position), it must be that A is not at position3. So the word either has one A that is not at position3, or two A's but none at position3? Yes. So if ""AWARE"" has an A at position3, that would be contradictory because guess1's feedback said A is not at position3. So ""AWARE"" cannot be the secret word because it has A at position3? Exactly.

  Therefore, we cannot use words that put A at position3? And in fact, we know A is not at position3.

  So for scenario A with R at position4: we have word A _ _ R E. The third position (position3) cannot be A? So we must have a distinct letter at position3 that isn't A? Which is already required.

  So ""ADORE"": A, D, O, R, E -> position1: A, position2: D, position3: O, position4: R, position5: E. 
  This doesn't put A at position3? Correct. So it's acceptable.

  Similarly, ""AMORE"": A, M, O, R, E -> position3 is O? Not A, so acceptable? But does it have any forbidden letter? No.

  Now back to Scenario B: _ _ R A E? We were struggling to find words. But let me think: 
      ""WHERE"": H at1, E at2? Wait, but E is at position2? And we have E at position5. Then ""WHERE"" is W-H-E-R-E? That doesn't match _ _ R A E. We need position3=R, position4=A? But in ""WHERE"", position4=R? And then position5=E? Doesn't have A? So no.

  ""BRAVE"": B, R, A, V, E -> positions: 
        1: B
        2: R -> but we know R cannot be at position2! Forbidden. So no.

  How about ""DRAKE"": D at1, R at2 -> not allowed.

  What about ""TRA"""" but then we need position3=R? Then we have _ _ R A E? 
      ""UMRAE""? Not a word.
      ""GRA"": no, 5 letters? So it's difficult.

  Alternatively, we can consider: maybe Scenario B doesn't have any common words? So we focus on Scenario A with Option 2: A at position1 and R at position4.

We have ""ADORE"" and ""AMORE"" as candidates.

But we should also consider if A could be at position4? Then R must be at position3? And then the word must be _ _ R A E? Words like ""LARAE""? Not a word. ""BARGE"" but ends with E? ""BARGE"" is B,A,R,G,E -> position1=B,2=A,3=R,4=G,5=E? Then position2=A? But we know A cannot be at position2? From guess2: A was tried at position2 and was marked '-' meaning A is present but not at position2? So the word cannot have A at position2? So any word with A at position2 is invalid.

Therefore, scenario B is problematic because it requires R at position3 and A at position4? Then positions 1 and 2? But what about ""OATER""? Not a common word. ""YARES"" -> has S? Forbidden.

So perhaps Scenario B is unlikely? So we'll focus on Scenario A Option 2: A _ _ R E.

Best words: ""ADORE"" and ""AMORE"". Also ""ARMORE""? Not 5.

Other words: 
    ""ATONE"": has N -> forbidden.
    ""ALONE"": has L and O? But N is forbidden.
    ""ABHOR"": doesn't end with E? No.

    ""ADORE"" is a solid choice.

But also: ""AMPLE"" -> doesn't have R? Required.

So we must include R? So only words that include both A and R? And the pattern.

Another word: ""ABORE"" is not valid? ""ABORE"" not a word.

""APIRE"": A, P, I, R, E -> but I is forbidden.

So ""ADORE"" is a good option.

We also want to test more new letters? In ""ADORE"", we are testing D and O? They haven't been tested yet.

Therefore, let's guess ""ADORE"".

But note: we are guessing ""ADORE"" to get information? Or we can think of a word that covers more possibilities? However, since we have limited choices, it's a good candidate.

Alternatively, we could try a word that might fit scenario B? But we don't think there is one? So let's go with ""ADORE"".

So our guess is ""ADORE"".

<guess>adore</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **crane**: E is correct at position 5 (✓), R and A are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3 (-), C and N are absent (x).
2. **raise**: E is confirmed again at position 5 (✓), R and A are in the word but not in positions 1 or 2 (-), I and S are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
- **Position 5 is E** (fixed).
- **R must be in position 3 or 4** (excluded from positions 1, 2).
- **A must be in position 1 or 4** (excluded from positions 2, 3).
- **Absent letters**: C, N, I, S.
- The word **must include R and A** in valid positions.

After eliminating scenarios where A and R conflict (e.g., both in position 4) or words with absent letters, the most plausible pattern is **A _ _ R E**:
- **A** in position 1.
- **R** in position 4.
- Position 2 and 3 are unknown (must be new letters not in {C, N, I, S}).

**ADORE** fits perfectly:
- A at position 1 (testing valid A position).
- R at position 4 (testing valid R position).
- New letters: **D** (position 2) and **O** (position 3) to gather more information.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, N, I, S) and adheres to the feedback.

This guess efficiently tests remaining possibilities while prioritizing new letters.",Guess 3: adore -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) D(✓) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
