We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) -> C is not in the secret word
R(-) -> R is in the secret word but in the wrong position
A(x) -> A is not in the secret word
N(x) -> N is not in the secret word
E(-) -> E is in the secret word but in the wrong position

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 for R and position 5 for E).
- The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that includes R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

Since R and E are in the word but not in the same positions, we need to try them in different positions.

Also, we should avoid using C, A, N in the new guess.

Consider the positions:
- In ""crane"", R was at position 2 (index 1). Since it's marked as wrong position, in the secret word R cannot be at index 1.
- E was at position 5 (index 4). Since it's marked as wrong position, in the secret word E cannot be at index 4.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

Idea: We should try a word that has R and E, and put them in positions we haven't tried.

Available positions for R: cannot be index 1. So possible indices: 0, 2, 3, 4.
Similarly for E: cannot be index 4, so possible indices: 0,1,2,3.

We also want to include other common letters to maximize information. Avoid C, A, N.

Common letters: S, T, O, L, I, D, H, U, etc.

Let me try to form a word.

Option: ""ROUTE""
- R at position 0 (which is allowed because we haven't tried R at 0 yet)
- E at position 4? But wait, our feedback says E cannot be at position 4? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 4. So using E at position 4 again might not be ideal because we know it's not there. However, we could try a different position.

But note: We must not repeat the same position for E? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know it's not at position 4. So better to put E in a new position.

In ""ROUTE"": R at 0, E at 4? But E at 4 we already know is wrong? So let's not put E at 4.

Another word: ""DRIVE""
- D, R, I, V, E
- R at index 1? Wait, R was previously at index 1 and we know that's wrong. So we must move R to a different position? Actually, in our first guess R was at index 1 and it was marked wrong position, meaning in the secret word R is not at index 1. So in ""DRIVE"", R is at index 1 again? That would be the same position, so we shouldn't put R at index 1.

Thus, we must avoid R at index 1 and E at index 4.

Suggestion: ""RISKY"", but R is at index 1? We must avoid that.

Let me try ""PRIDE"":
- P at 0 (new letter)
- R at 1 -> but: we know R cannot be at index 1? So avoiding that.

So we need R at position other than 1.

Idea: put R at position 0 or position 2 or 3 or 4.

Similarly, put E at index 0,1,2,3.

Also, we know the secret word has 5 letters and contains R and E.

Possible word: ""DRIVE"" has R at index 1 which is bad.

Alternative: ""GRIPE""
- G at 0?
- R at 1 -> again index1, bad.

We need a word where R is not at the second letter.

Another: ""EAGER"", but we know A is not in the word? And E is at 0 and 4? We know E is not at 4? Also, we must avoid A.

Avoid A: so skip.

Try: ""RODEO""? Contains A? R O D E O - not 5 distinct? But even then, O repeated? And E at position 3? But we know E exists.

But feedback: Also, we can try words even with duplicates? Actually, the rules don't say we must avoid duplicates? But the word must be a valid English word.

However, we know the secret word has 5 letters, but it might have duplicates? The feedback doesn't forbid that.

But in the example, duplicates would show up. However, in our case, we don't know.

But to be safe, I think we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

But ""RODEO"" has two O's? And we don't know about O.

But let's avoid for now.

Word: ""TIRED""
- T at 0 (common letter)
- I at 1
- R at 2? That's a new position for R (index 2). Previously R was at index1, now index2? That's good because we avoid the wrong position.
- E at 3? Also, E at index 3? Previously E at index 4. Now index3? That's allowed because it's a new position.
- D at 4? 

So ""TIRED"" has R at position 3? Let's check:
Position 0: T
Position 1: I
Position 2: R
Position 3: E
Position 4: D

But R is at index 2? And E at index 3.

We know R and E are in the word, just not in the first positions we guessed.

Also, we avoid C, A, N.

So ""TIRED"" seems a good choice? Is it valid? Yes.

But wait, are we allowed to use letters we know are not in the word? We know C, A, N are not in the word? So yes, but ""TIRED"" doesn't contain C, A, N.

What about the word? Valid English word.

Alternatively, another word: ""QUERY"", but Q is less common.

Or ""WRECK"", but we have C? Wait, we know C is not in the word? So we must avoid C? Because we were told C(x) -> not in word.

Yes! Important: Since C was marked as not in the word, we must not use C again. Similarly, A and N.

So in ""TIRED"": Letters T, I, R, E, D. None of these are C, A, or N. So it's okay.

Another candidate: ""SPIRE"", which has S, P, I, R, E? But E is at the end? Position 4? We know that in secret word E is not at position 4? So if we use E at position 4, it might be marked wrong position again? To save a guess, better not to put E at position4? We already know position4 is wrong? So we can avoid that.

Therefore, in ""TIRED"", E is at position3? That's position we haven't tried? So that's good.

Similarly, R is at position2? Previously R was at position1? We can try position2.

Another word: ""PROSE""? But has O? And E at 4? We don't know about O? But E at 4 we know is wrong? And O is new.

But I think ""TIRED"" is fine.

Let me check: With ""TIRED"":

- If the secret word has R at index0? Then in our guess we have R at index2? Then the feedback would mark R correctly? If it's at the right location? Or if at another, wrong location.

But we are trying to get information.

Since we already know R and E, we might want to cover more letters.

In ""TIRED"", we have T, I, R, E, D.

Among these, R and E we know exist? But others are new? So we get info on T, I, D.

Perfect.

Also, avoiding known bad letters.

So I think ""TIRED"" is a good second guess.

But wait: Was R already used? Actually, we can reuse letters? But with position shifts.

Yes.

Alternatively, ""SLEPT"", then E at position1? And S, L, P, T? Then E at index1? Previously we tried index4? So index1 is new? But then what about R? We forgot to include R? Oh, we know R is in the word, so we should include it? Because we have limited tries? And we must find where R is.

Yes! Since R must be in the word, we should try to include it in this guess to pin down its position.

Similarly for E.

Therefore, we must include both R and E in the guess? Because they are known to be in the secret word? But we don't have to? Actually, no rule forces us? But if we don't, we might not get information about them? Since we already know they exist? But we have to find their positions.

So best to include both.

How about ""DRIVER""? Too long? We need 5-letter.

5-letter: ""RIDER""? Has two R's? Then R exists? And E? No E in ""RIDER"". So miss E? Then we wouldn't test E positions? But we know E exists? So we can leave E for next? But we have E to position? Similarly R? So better include both? Since we have to place both anyway.

Another word: ""PRIME"", P,R,I,M,E? Then R at index1? We know R cannot be at index? Index1? So avoid index1.

Put R at index1? But that would be the same position? And we know this position is wrong? So the feedback would again be (-) for R? Because it exists but wrong position? But we already know that? So we don't get new information about R? Unless we move it? So better to change the position.

Therefore, we should use a word that has R in a position that we have not tried? That includes index0,2,3,4? Similarly for E, avoid index4? So try index0,1,2,3.

Now, with two constraints: R not at index1, E not at index4? Plus include both R and E? With E at a new position.

So ""TIRED"" has:
Index0: T
Index1: I
Index2: R
Index3: E
Index4: D

Thus:
- R is at index2? Which is new? So we test R at position3? [counting from 0? Actually positions: 0,1,2,3,4]
- E is at index3? Previously we tried index4? So we test E at position4? No? Previously E was at position5 (if counting from1)? But in code, positions? 
In ""crane"": positions: 0:C, 1:R, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E. Then E was index4? And now in ""TIRED"", E is index3? Great.

Also, includes new letters: T, I, D.

Therefore, I think ""TIRED"" is a solid second guess.

So my guess: TIRED

We'll submit it.

<guess>tired</guess>

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N are not in the secret word (marked as 'x').
- R and E are in the secret word, but not at positions 1 and 4 (in ""crane"", R was at position 1 and marked '-', E was at position 4 and marked '-').

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and E since they are in the secret word.
- R cannot be at position 1 again (to avoid repeating a known wrong position).
- E cannot be at position 4 again (to avoid repeating a known wrong position).
- Avoid using C, A, or N.
- Aim for new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) to maximize information.

The word ""tired"" works well:
- Positions: T at 0 (new position/letter), I at 1 (new letter), R at 2 (new position for R), E at 3 (new position for E, avoiding position 4), D at 4 (new letter).
- Avoids C, A, N.
- Tests R in position 2 and E in position 3, while introducing new letters T, I, D.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) -> C is not in the secret word
R(-) -> R is in the secret word but in the wrong position
A(x) -> A is not in the secret word
N(x) -> N is not in the secret word
E(-) -> E is in the secret word but in the wrong position

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 for R and position 5 for E).
- The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that includes R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

Since R and E are in the word but not in the same positions, we need to try them in different positions.

Also, we should avoid using C, A, N in the new guess.

Consider the positions:
- In ""crane"", R was at position 2 (index 1). Since it's marked as wrong position, in the secret word R cannot be at index 1.
- E was at position 5 (index 4). Since it's marked as wrong position, in the secret word E cannot be at index 4.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

Idea: We should try a word that has R and E, and put them in positions we haven't tried.

Available positions for R: cannot be index 1. So possible indices: 0, 2, 3, 4.
Similarly for E: cannot be index 4, so possible indices: 0,1,2,3.

We also want to include other common letters to maximize information. Avoid C, A, N.

Common letters: S, T, O, L, I, D, H, U, etc.

Let me try to form a word.

Option: ""ROUTE""
- R at position 0 (which is allowed because we haven't tried R at 0 yet)
- E at position 4? But wait, our feedback says E cannot be at position 4? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 4. So using E at position 4 again might not be ideal because we know it's not there. However, we could try a different position.

But note: We must not repeat the same position for E? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know it's not at position 4. So better to put E in a new position.

In ""ROUTE"": R at 0, E at 4? But E at 4 we already know is wrong? So let's not put E at 4.

Another word: ""DRIVE""
- D, R, I, V, E
- R at index 1? Wait, R was previously at index 1 and we know that's wrong. So we must move R to a different position? Actually, in our first guess R was at index 1 and it was marked wrong position, meaning in the secret word R is not at index 1. So in ""DRIVE"", R is at index 1 again? That would be the same position, so we shouldn't put R at index 1.

Thus, we must avoid R at index 1 and E at index 4.

Suggestion: ""RISKY"", but R is at index 1? We must avoid that.

Let me try ""PRIDE"":
- P at 0 (new letter)
- R at 1 -> but: we know R cannot be at index 1? So avoiding that.

So we need R at position other than 1.

Idea: put R at position 0 or position 2 or 3 or 4.

Similarly, put E at index 0,1,2,3.

Also, we know the secret word has 5 letters and contains R and E.

Possible word: ""DRIVE"" has R at index 1 which is bad.

Alternative: ""GRIPE""
- G at 0?
- R at 1 -> again index1, bad.

We need a word where R is not at the second letter.

Another: ""EAGER"", but we know A is not in the word? And E is at 0 and 4? We know E is not at 4? Also, we must avoid A.

Avoid A: so skip.

Try: ""RODEO""? Contains A? R O D E O - not 5 distinct? But even then, O repeated? And E at position 3? But we know E exists.

But feedback: Also, we can try words even with duplicates? Actually, the rules don't say we must avoid duplicates? But the word must be a valid English word.

However, we know the secret word has 5 letters, but it might have duplicates? The feedback doesn't forbid that.

But in the example, duplicates would show up. However, in our case, we don't know.

But to be safe, I think we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

But ""RODEO"" has two O's? And we don't know about O.

But let's avoid for now.

Word: ""TIRED""
- T at 0 (common letter)
- I at 1
- R at 2? That's a new position for R (index 2). Previously R was at index1, now index2? That's good because we avoid the wrong position.
- E at 3? Also, E at index 3? Previously E at index 4. Now index3? That's allowed because it's a new position.
- D at 4? 

So ""TIRED"" has R at position 3? Let's check:
Position 0: T
Position 1: I
Position 2: R
Position 3: E
Position 4: D

But R is at index 2? And E at index 3.

We know R and E are in the word, just not in the first positions we guessed.

Also, we avoid C, A, N.

So ""TIRED"" seems a good choice? Is it valid? Yes.

But wait, are we allowed to use letters we know are not in the word? We know C, A, N are not in the word? So yes, but ""TIRED"" doesn't contain C, A, N.

What about the word? Valid English word.

Alternatively, another word: ""QUERY"", but Q is less common.

Or ""WRECK"", but we have C? Wait, we know C is not in the word? So we must avoid C? Because we were told C(x) -> not in word.

Yes! Important: Since C was marked as not in the word, we must not use C again. Similarly, A and N.

So in ""TIRED"": Letters T, I, R, E, D. None of these are C, A, or N. So it's okay.

Another candidate: ""SPIRE"", which has S, P, I, R, E? But E is at the end? Position 4? We know that in secret word E is not at position 4? So if we use E at position 4, it might be marked wrong position again? To save a guess, better not to put E at position4? We already know position4 is wrong? So we can avoid that.

Therefore, in ""TIRED"", E is at position3? That's position we haven't tried? So that's good.

Similarly, R is at position2? Previously R was at position1? We can try position2.

Another word: ""PROSE""? But has O? And E at 4? We don't know about O? But E at 4 we know is wrong? And O is new.

But I think ""TIRED"" is fine.

Let me check: With ""TIRED"":

- If the secret word has R at index0? Then in our guess we have R at index2? Then the feedback would mark R correctly? If it's at the right location? Or if at another, wrong location.

But we are trying to get information.

Since we already know R and E, we might want to cover more letters.

In ""TIRED"", we have T, I, R, E, D.

Among these, R and E we know exist? But others are new? So we get info on T, I, D.

Perfect.

Also, avoiding known bad letters.

So I think ""TIRED"" is a good second guess.

But wait: Was R already used? Actually, we can reuse letters? But with position shifts.

Yes.

Alternatively, ""SLEPT"", then E at position1? And S, L, P, T? Then E at index1? Previously we tried index4? So index1 is new? But then what about R? We forgot to include R? Oh, we know R is in the word, so we should include it? Because we have limited tries? And we must find where R is.

Yes! Since R must be in the word, we should try to include it in this guess to pin down its position.

Similarly for E.

Therefore, we must include both R and E in the guess? Because they are known to be in the secret word? But we don't have to? Actually, no rule forces us? But if we don't, we might not get information about them? Since we already know they exist? But we have to find their positions.

So best to include both.

How about ""DRIVER""? Too long? We need 5-letter.

5-letter: ""RIDER""? Has two R's? Then R exists? And E? No E in ""RIDER"". So miss E? Then we wouldn't test E positions? But we know E exists? So we can leave E for next? But we have E to position? Similarly R? So better include both? Since we have to place both anyway.

Another word: ""PRIME"", P,R,I,M,E? Then R at index1? We know R cannot be at index? Index1? So avoid index1.

Put R at index1? But that would be the same position? And we know this position is wrong? So the feedback would again be (-) for R? Because it exists but wrong position? But we already know that? So we don't get new information about R? Unless we move it? So better to change the position.

Therefore, we should use a word that has R in a position that we have not tried? That includes index0,2,3,4? Similarly for E, avoid index4? So try index0,1,2,3.

Now, with two constraints: R not at index1, E not at index4? Plus include both R and E? With E at a new position.

So ""TIRED"" has:
Index0: T
Index1: I
Index2: R
Index3: E
Index4: D

Thus:
- R is at index2? Which is new? So we test R at position3? [counting from 0? Actually positions: 0,1,2,3,4]
- E is at index3? Previously we tried index4? So we test E at position4? No? Previously E was at position5 (if counting from1)? But in code, positions? 
In ""crane"": positions: 0:C, 1:R, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E. Then E was index4? And now in ""TIRED"", E is index3? Great.

Also, includes new letters: T, I, D.

Therefore, I think ""TIRED"" is a solid second guess.

So my guess: TIRED

We'll submit it.

<guess>tired</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N are not in the secret word (marked as 'x').
- R and E are in the secret word, but not at positions 1 and 4 (in ""crane"", R was at position 1 and marked '-', E was at position 4 and marked '-').

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and E since they are in the secret word.
- R cannot be at position 1 again (to avoid repeating a known wrong position).
- E cannot be at position 4 again (to avoid repeating a known wrong position).
- Avoid using C, A, or N.
- Aim for new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) to maximize information.

The word ""tired"" works well:
- Positions: T at 0 (new position/letter), I at 1 (new letter), R at 2 (new position for R), E at 3 (new position for E, avoiding position 4), D at 4 (new letter).
- Avoids C, A, N.
- Tests R in position 2 and E in position 3, while introducing new letters T, I, D.

This guess helps narrow down positions for R and E and provides information on other letters.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: not in word (x)
- R: in word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-)

Second guess: ""tired""
- T: not in word (x)
- I: correct position (✓) at index 1 (second letter)
- R: in word but wrong position (-) - note: in ""tired"", R is at index 2
- E: correct position (✓) at index 3 (fourth letter)
- D: not in word (x)

What we know so far:
1. The secret word has I as the second letter (index 1) and E as the fourth letter (index 3). So the word pattern is: _ I _ E _
2. The word contains R, but not at the positions we've tried: 
   - In ""crane"", R was at index 1 (second position) and was wrong -> so R is not at index 1.
   - In ""tired"", R was at index 2 (third position) and was wrong -> so R is not at index 2.
   Therefore, R must be at index 0, 3, or 4? But wait, index 3 is already taken by E? So R cannot be at index 3? Because index 3 is E? So R must be at index 0 or 4? But index 4 is the last letter? And we haven't tried R at index 0 or 4.

   However, note: in the pattern _ I _ E _, the positions are:
   index0: unknown
   index1: I (fixed)
   index2: unknown
   index3: E (fixed)
   index4: unknown

   So R must be in one of the unknown positions: index0, index2, or index4? But we have tried R at index2 (in ""tired"") and it was wrong? So R is not at index2. Therefore, R must be at index0 or index4.

3. The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, D (from the x's).

4. We also know that E is at index3, so we don't need to test that again? But we have it fixed.

Now, we need to form a word that fits the pattern: _ I _ E _

And we know the letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, T, D.

Also, we must include R? Because we know R is in the word? But we haven't placed it yet? So we have to include R in one of the unknown positions: index0, index2, or index4? But index2 is already tried? So only index0 or index4? But note: we have two unknowns: index0 and index4? And index2 is also unknown? But we tried R at index2 and it was wrong? So R is not at index2? Therefore, R must be at index0 or index4.

But wait, the pattern has three unknown positions: index0, index2, index4? But we know R must be in one of them? And we have two positions left? Actually, we have three positions? But R can only be in one? So the other two positions are for other letters.

But we also know that the word has exactly 5 letters? And we have fixed I and E? So the other three are unknown? But we know one of them must be R? And the other two are new letters? But we have to avoid C, A, N, T, D.

So the word pattern: [R?] I [some letter] E [R?]

But R can only be at one position? So either:
- If R is at index0: then the word is R I ? E ?
- If R is at index4: then the word is ? I ? E R

But we don't know which? So we need to test.

Also, the middle letter at index2 is unknown? And must be a letter that we haven't tried? And not in the exclusion list.

Now, for the next guess, we want to maximize information? But we have two possibilities? So we can try to cover both? Or we can try a word that has R at index0? Or at index4? And also test new letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries? So we need to be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at index0? And then if it's not, then R must be at index4? But we can do that in two steps? But we can also try to cover more letters.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and include R? And avoid the bad letters.

First, if R is at index0: then the word starts with ""RI"" and then any letter (not C,A,N,T,D) and then ""E"" and then any letter (not C,A,N,T,D). But the last letter could be R? But if R is at index0, then it cannot be at index4? Because we don't know if the word has two R's? But the feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates? So it could have two R's? But we don't know? So we must consider.

But in our case, we know R is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? So we have to be cautious.

Similarly, if R is at index4, then the word ends with ""R"", and the first letter is not R? But again, could be two R's? But we don't know.

To simplify, let's assume no duplicates for now? But we can't assume? So we have to consider.

But to maximize information, we can try a word that has R at index0? And then new letters? And see.

But we also have to fill the pattern.

List of possible words? But we don't have the dictionary? So we have to think of common words.

Common words with pattern _ I _ E _ and avoiding C,A,N,T,D.

Available letters: we can use B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common ones.

We also know that R must be at index0 or index4? So we can try one of the cases.

But we can also try a word that doesn't have R? But we know R is in the word? So we must include it? Because if we don't, we might not get information about its position? But we already know it's in the word? So we can skip including it? But then we don't know where it is? So better to include it? Since we have to find the position.

So let's try to form a word with R at index0? And then we can test that.

For example: ""RIPER""? But has two R's? And E at index3? But we have E fixed? And the pattern is R I ? E R? Then index4 is R? But we don't know if R is at index4? And also, we have to avoid D? But ""RIPER"" has R at 0 and 4? And P at 2? But is it valid? ""RIPER"" is a word? Meaning one who ripes? Or is it ""ripper""? No, ""riper"" is a word? But let's see: R I P E R? That's 5 letters? But we have two R's? And we don't know if the secret word has two R's? But we can try? But we also have to avoid T? T is not in ""RIPER""? But we have to avoid D? D is not in? But we have to avoid C,A,N,T,D? So ""RIPER"" has none of these? But we have two R's? And we know R is in the word? But we don't know if it's duplicated? So it's possible? But let's see the feedback? We might get confused? Because if the secret word has only one R? Then the R at index4 might be marked as not in word? Or if it's in the word but wrong position? But we have R at index0? Which we are testing? And if the secret word has R at index0? Then it would be marked correct? But if the secret word has R at index4? Then the R at index0 might be marked as wrong? And R at index4? But we don't have R at index4 in the guess? Wait, in ""RIPER"", we have R at index0 and index4? So if the secret word has R at index0? Then the first R is correct? And the last R? If the secret word has only one R? Then the last R would be marked as not in word? Or if it has two? Then both might be marked? But we don't know? So it might be messy? But we can try? However, we have limited guesses? So better to avoid duplicates? To keep it simple? So let's avoid using R twice? Unless necessary? But we can try a word with R only once? And at a new position? Which is either index0 or index4? And then the other positions with new letters.

So for example, if we put R at index0: then the word is R I ? E ? 

The third letter (index2) must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,D}? And the last letter (index4) must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,D}? And we want to use common letters? To maximize chance of hitting.

Similarly, if we put R at index4: then the word is ? I ? E R? And the first and third letters are new.

But we don't know which? So we can choose one? Or we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But that might be hard? Because we have to have R at one of them? But we can only put R at one position? So we have to choose.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at index0? And then if it's not? Then next time we put at index4? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can do that.

But we can also try to cover more letters? So let's try R at index0? And then use two new common letters? For index2 and index4.

For example: ""RIPEN""? But N is not allowed? Because we know N is not in the word? From first guess? So avoid N.

""RIPED""? But D is not allowed? And also, ""riped"" is not a word? It's ""ripened"" without n? Not valid.

""RICES""? But C and S? C is not allowed? And also, we avoid C.

""RIFLE""? R I F L E? Then pattern: R I F L E? But we have E at index4? But in the pattern, we have E fixed at index3? But in ""RIFLE"", E is at index4? But we need E at index3? So that doesn't match? Because we know E must be at index3? So the word must have E at index3? So the fourth letter must be E? So we cannot change that? So in our guess, we must have the second letter I and the fourth letter E? So the pattern is fixed: _ I _ E _

Therefore, for ""RIFLE"": it would be R I F L E? Then the fourth letter is L? Not E? So that doesn't work? Because we must have E at index3? So the word must be of the form ? I ? E ?

So we cannot use ""RIFLE"" because it has E at the end? Not at index3.

So we must have the fourth letter as E? So the word must end with E? No? The fourth letter is E? But the fifth letter is still unknown? So the word is ... E at the fourth position? And then a fifth letter? So it's not necessarily ending with E? For example, ""RIPEN"" has E at index3? And then N at index4? But we know N is not in the word? So we cannot use that.

So let's think of words that fit: ? I ? E ?

With R at index0: so ""R I ? E ?""

Common words: 
- ""RIPER"": but has two R's? And E at index3? Then last letter R? So ""R I P E R""? But we don't know if R is duplicated? And we avoid duplicates? So skip? 
- ""RIPES"": R I P E S? Then S at index4? And P at index2? Avoids C,A,N,T,D? So S is new? P is new? So we can try? But is ""RIPES"" a word? Yes, as in ""ripens"" but for fruit? Or third person? But it's a valid word? 
- ""RICES"": but C is not allowed? 
- ""RIDES"": but D is not allowed? 
- ""RIFLE"": doesn't fit because E must be at index3? But in ""RIFLE"", index3 is L? So no? 
- ""RINSE"": but N is not allowed? 
- ""RIPED"": not a word? 
- ""RIVER"": R I V E R? Then V at index2? And R at index0 and index4? Duplicate R? And we avoid? But let's see? 
- ""RISER"": R I S E R? Then S at index2? And R at index0 and index4? Again duplicate? 

But we can try without duplicate? So ""RIPES"": R I P E S? Then P at index2? S at index4? And no duplicate? And letters: R, I, P, E, S? Avoids C,A,N,T,D? So we can try? 

But we know that in the secret word, R might be at index0? Or index4? So if we put R at index0? And the secret word has R at index0? Then it would be marked correct? If not? Then it might be marked as wrong? Or if the secret word has R at index4? Then the R at index0 would be marked as wrong? Because it's in the word but wrong position? But we have S at index4? So if the secret word has R at index4? Then S at index4 would be marked as not in word? Or if the secret word has R at index0? Then S at index4 might be marked as not in word? Or if it is? 

But we are testing: if we get R at index0 correct? Then we know R is at index0? And then we only have to find the letter at index2 and index4? But we have S at index4? So we get feedback on S? 

Similarly, if R at index0 is marked as wrong? Then we know R must be at index4? Because we have only two possibilities? And then we can use that in the next guess? 

So ""RIPES"" seems a good candidate? 

But what about the letter at index2? We are testing P? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at index4? For example: ? I ? E R? 

Then the first letter and the third letter are new? 

For example: ""WISER"": W I S E R? Then W at index0? S at index2? R at index4? And no duplicates? Avoids C,A,N,T,D? 

But we know that in the secret word, E is at index3? So ""WISER"" has E at index3? And R at index4? So pattern: W I S E R? 

Then we test: if R is at index4? If it is? Then we get it correct? If not? Then we know R must be at index0? 

But we have two options? So which one to choose? 

We can choose either? But let's see which one covers more common letters? 

In ""RIPES"": letters R, I, P, E, S? We already know I and E? So we are testing R, P, S? But R we are testing at index0? P at index2? S at index4? 

In ""WISER"": W, I, S, E, R? Testing W, S, R? With R at index4? 

Both are valid? But ""RIPES"" has P and S? ""WISER"" has W and S? P is more common than W? So ""RIPES"" might be better? 

But we also have to consider that if we put R at index0? And it is correct? Then we have the first letter? And then we only have to find index2 and index4? But we have P and S? 

Similarly, if we put R at index4? And it is correct? Then we have the last letter? And then we have to find index0 and index2? 

But we have to choose one? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have R? But then we don't test R? But we know R is in the word? So we should test? 

But we can also choose a word that has R at index0? And also tests other common letters? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has the letter at index2? And then we can get information about that? And also, we can set R at one of the ends? 

But I think ""RIPES"" is fine? 

But let's see the feedback from the second guess: we have I at index1 correct? And E at index3 correct? So we have two fixed? And we know R is in the word? But not at index2? So we are testing index0 and index4? 

So in ""RIPES"", we are putting R at index0? And S at index4? And P at index2? 

If the secret word has R at index0? Then the first letter R would be marked correct? And then we know the word is R I ? E ? 

Then we have to find the letter at index2 and index4? We have P at index2? If P is in the word? Then we get feedback? Similarly for S? 

If the secret word does not have R at index0? Then the R at index0 would be marked as wrong? But we know R is in the word? So it must be at index4? Then we know the word is ? I ? E R? 

And then we have P at index2? And S at index4? But if R is at index4? Then S at index4 would be marked as not in word? Because the secret word has R at index4? So S is not in the word? Or if S is in the word? But at another position? But we don't know? 

But we get feedback? 

So it's acceptable? 

But to avoid confusion? We can choose a word that has R at index0? And then the other positions with letters that are not likely to be at the ends? But I think it's fine? 

Another word: ""RIPEN"" is not allowed? Because N is bad? 

""RICES"" not allowed? 

""RIDES"" not allowed? 

""RIFLE"" doesn't fit? 

""RISEN"": R I S E N? But N is bad? 

""RIPED"" not a word? 

So ""RIPES"" or ""RIVER"" (but duplicate)? 

Or ""RISER"" (duplicate)? 

Or ""RIDER"" (duplicate and D is bad)? 

So ""RIPES"" seems the best? 

But let's consider ""WISER"": if we put R at index4? Then we test W at index0? S at index2? 

If R is at index4? Then we get it correct? And then we know the word is ? I ? E R? And we have W at index0? S at index2? 

If R is not at index4? Then we know it must be at index0? And then we have W at index0? Which would be marked as not in word? Or wrong? 

But we get information? 

But ""WISER"" has W? Which is less common? So ""RIPES"" with P and S? More common? 

But we can also try ""PRIZE""? But Z is less common? 

Or ""BRINE""? But B is new? But N is bad? 

So I think ""RIPES"" is a good choice? 

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid? 

""RIPES"" is a valid word? Meaning the third person singular of ""ripe""? Or as in fruit? But it's accepted? 

So I'll go with ""RIPES"". 

But let's see: in ""RIPES"", we have E at index3? Which is fixed? And I at index1? Fixed? So we are guessing: 
- R at index0? 
- P at index2? 
- S at index4? 

And we avoid C,A,N,T,D? 

So feedback will tell us: 
- If R is at index0? 
- If P is in the word? And if so, where? 
- If S is in the word? And if so, where? 

And if R is not at index0? Then we know R must be at index4? 

So we can proceed? 

Therefore, third guess: ""RIPES"" 

But wait, what if the secret word has P at index2? Then we get it? Or if not? 

But we have to try? 

So <guess>ripes</guess> 

But let me double-check the pattern: 
Position 0: R 
Position 1: I (fixed) 
Position 2: P 
Position 3: E (fixed) 
Position 4: S 

Yes. 

We'll see the feedback.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(in word, wrong position), A(not in word), N(not in word), E(in word, wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - R and E are in the secret word.  
    - C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  
    - R is not at position 1 (index 1), and E is not at position 4 (index 4).  

- **Guess 2: ""tired""** → Feedback: T(not in word), I(correct position), R(in word, wrong position), E(correct position), D(not in word).  
  - This reveals:  
    - I is at position 1 (index 1) and E is at position 3 (index 3) in the secret word.  
    - T and D are not in the secret word.  
    - R is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2) (since it was marked as wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern is: `[?] I [?] E [?]` (positions: index 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).  
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
  - Position 1 (index 1) = `I`  
  - Position 3 (index 3) = `E`  
- **R must be in the word** but cannot be at:  
  - Position 1 (from ""crane"" feedback)  
  - Position 2 (from ""tired"" feedback)  
  - Since position 3 is fixed as `E`, R must be at position 0 or 4.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, T, D (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Goal for next guess**:  
  - Test R at position 0 (index 0) to resolve its location (if R is not at position 0, it must be at position 4).  
  - Introduce new common letters to test the remaining unknown positions (index 2 and index 4).  
  - Avoid excluded letters and reuse known correct positions (I at index 1, E at index 3).  

### Chosen Guess: ""RIPES""
- **Word breakdown**:  
  - Position 0: `R` (tests if R is at index 0)  
  - Position 1: `I` (fixed, known correct)  
  - Position 2: `P` (new letter, tests index 2)  
  - Position 3: `E` (fixed, known correct)  
  - Position 4: `S` (new letter, tests index 4)  
- **Why ""RIPES""?**  
  - Tests R at position 0: If correct, R is at index 0; if wrong, R must be at index 4.  
  - Introduces common letters `P` and `S` to gather information on positions 2 and 4.  
  - Avoids excluded letters (C, A, N, T, D).  
  - Uses a valid 5-letter word with high-frequency letters.  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If R is at position 0, feedback will confirm it (✓).  
  - If R is not at position 0, feedback will show it as wrong position (-) or not in word (x), confirming R must be at position 4.  
  - Feedback on `P` and `S` will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.  

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for R while testing new letters in the remaining unknown positions.

<guess>ripes</guess>",ripes,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: not in word (x)
- R: in word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-)

Second guess: ""tired""
- T: not in word (x)
- I: correct position (✓) at index 1 (second letter)
- R: in word but wrong position (-) - note: in ""tired"", R is at index 2
- E: correct position (✓) at index 3 (fourth letter)
- D: not in word (x)

What we know so far:
1. The secret word has I as the second letter (index 1) and E as the fourth letter (index 3). So the word pattern is: _ I _ E _
2. The word contains R, but not at the positions we've tried: 
   - In ""crane"", R was at index 1 (second position) and was wrong -> so R is not at index 1.
   - In ""tired"", R was at index 2 (third position) and was wrong -> so R is not at index 2.
   Therefore, R must be at index 0, 3, or 4? But wait, index 3 is already taken by E? So R cannot be at index 3? Because index 3 is E? So R must be at index 0 or 4? But index 4 is the last letter? And we haven't tried R at index 0 or 4.

   However, note: in the pattern _ I _ E _, the positions are:
   index0: unknown
   index1: I (fixed)
   index2: unknown
   index3: E (fixed)
   index4: unknown

   So R must be in one of the unknown positions: index0, index2, or index4? But we have tried R at index2 (in ""tired"") and it was wrong? So R is not at index2. Therefore, R must be at index0 or index4.

3. The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, D (from the x's).

4. We also know that E is at index3, so we don't need to test that again? But we have it fixed.

Now, we need to form a word that fits the pattern: _ I _ E _

And we know the letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, T, D.

Also, we must include R? Because we know R is in the word? But we haven't placed it yet? So we have to include R in one of the unknown positions: index0, index2, or index4? But index2 is already tried? So only index0 or index4? But note: we have two unknowns: index0 and index4? And index2 is also unknown? But we tried R at index2 and it was wrong? So R is not at index2? Therefore, R must be at index0 or index4.

But wait, the pattern has three unknown positions: index0, index2, index4? But we know R must be in one of them? And we have two positions left? Actually, we have three positions? But R can only be in one? So the other two positions are for other letters.

But we also know that the word has exactly 5 letters? And we have fixed I and E? So the other three are unknown? But we know one of them must be R? And the other two are new letters? But we have to avoid C, A, N, T, D.

So the word pattern: [R?] I [some letter] E [R?]

But R can only be at one position? So either:
- If R is at index0: then the word is R I ? E ?
- If R is at index4: then the word is ? I ? E R

But we don't know which? So we need to test.

Also, the middle letter at index2 is unknown? And must be a letter that we haven't tried? And not in the exclusion list.

Now, for the next guess, we want to maximize information? But we have two possibilities? So we can try to cover both? Or we can try a word that has R at index0? Or at index4? And also test new letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries? So we need to be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at index0? And then if it's not, then R must be at index4? But we can do that in two steps? But we can also try to cover more letters.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and include R? And avoid the bad letters.

First, if R is at index0: then the word starts with ""RI"" and then any letter (not C,A,N,T,D) and then ""E"" and then any letter (not C,A,N,T,D). But the last letter could be R? But if R is at index0, then it cannot be at index4? Because we don't know if the word has two R's? But the feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates? So it could have two R's? But we don't know? So we must consider.

But in our case, we know R is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? So we have to be cautious.

Similarly, if R is at index4, then the word ends with ""R"", and the first letter is not R? But again, could be two R's? But we don't know.

To simplify, let's assume no duplicates for now? But we can't assume? So we have to consider.

But to maximize information, we can try a word that has R at index0? And then new letters? And see.

But we also have to fill the pattern.

List of possible words? But we don't have the dictionary? So we have to think of common words.

Common words with pattern _ I _ E _ and avoiding C,A,N,T,D.

Available letters: we can use B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common ones.

We also know that R must be at index0 or index4? So we can try one of the cases.

But we can also try a word that doesn't have R? But we know R is in the word? So we must include it? Because if we don't, we might not get information about its position? But we already know it's in the word? So we can skip including it? But then we don't know where it is? So better to include it? Since we have to find the position.

So let's try to form a word with R at index0? And then we can test that.

For example: ""RIPER""? But has two R's? And E at index3? But we have E fixed? And the pattern is R I ? E R? Then index4 is R? But we don't know if R is at index4? And also, we have to avoid D? But ""RIPER"" has R at 0 and 4? And P at 2? But is it valid? ""RIPER"" is a word? Meaning one who ripes? Or is it ""ripper""? No, ""riper"" is a word? But let's see: R I P E R? That's 5 letters? But we have two R's? And we don't know if the secret word has two R's? But we can try? But we also have to avoid T? T is not in ""RIPER""? But we have to avoid D? D is not in? But we have to avoid C,A,N,T,D? So ""RIPER"" has none of these? But we have two R's? And we know R is in the word? But we don't know if it's duplicated? So it's possible? But let's see the feedback? We might get confused? Because if the secret word has only one R? Then the R at index4 might be marked as not in word? Or if it's in the word but wrong position? But we have R at index0? Which we are testing? And if the secret word has R at index0? Then it would be marked correct? But if the secret word has R at index4? Then the R at index0 might be marked as wrong? And R at index4? But we don't have R at index4 in the guess? Wait, in ""RIPER"", we have R at index0 and index4? So if the secret word has R at index0? Then the first R is correct? And the last R? If the secret word has only one R? Then the last R would be marked as not in word? Or if it has two? Then both might be marked? But we don't know? So it might be messy? But we can try? However, we have limited guesses? So better to avoid duplicates? To keep it simple? So let's avoid using R twice? Unless necessary? But we can try a word with R only once? And at a new position? Which is either index0 or index4? And then the other positions with new letters.

So for example, if we put R at index0: then the word is R I ? E ? 

The third letter (index2) must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,D}? And the last letter (index4) must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,D}? And we want to use common letters? To maximize chance of hitting.

Similarly, if we put R at index4: then the word is ? I ? E R? And the first and third letters are new.

But we don't know which? So we can choose one? Or we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But that might be hard? Because we have to have R at one of them? But we can only put R at one position? So we have to choose.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at index0? And then if it's not? Then next time we put at index4? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can do that.

But we can also try to cover more letters? So let's try R at index0? And then use two new common letters? For index2 and index4.

For example: ""RIPEN""? But N is not allowed? Because we know N is not in the word? From first guess? So avoid N.

""RIPED""? But D is not allowed? And also, ""riped"" is not a word? It's ""ripened"" without n? Not valid.

""RICES""? But C and S? C is not allowed? And also, we avoid C.

""RIFLE""? R I F L E? Then pattern: R I F L E? But we have E at index4? But in the pattern, we have E fixed at index3? But in ""RIFLE"", E is at index4? But we need E at index3? So that doesn't match? Because we know E must be at index3? So the word must have E at index3? So the fourth letter must be E? So we cannot change that? So in our guess, we must have the second letter I and the fourth letter E? So the pattern is fixed: _ I _ E _

Therefore, for ""RIFLE"": it would be R I F L E? Then the fourth letter is L? Not E? So that doesn't work? Because we must have E at index3? So the word must be of the form ? I ? E ?

So we cannot use ""RIFLE"" because it has E at the end? Not at index3.

So we must have the fourth letter as E? So the word must end with E? No? The fourth letter is E? But the fifth letter is still unknown? So the word is ... E at the fourth position? And then a fifth letter? So it's not necessarily ending with E? For example, ""RIPEN"" has E at index3? And then N at index4? But we know N is not in the word? So we cannot use that.

So let's think of words that fit: ? I ? E ?

With R at index0: so ""R I ? E ?""

Common words: 
- ""RIPER"": but has two R's? And E at index3? Then last letter R? So ""R I P E R""? But we don't know if R is duplicated? And we avoid duplicates? So skip? 
- ""RIPES"": R I P E S? Then S at index4? And P at index2? Avoids C,A,N,T,D? So S is new? P is new? So we can try? But is ""RIPES"" a word? Yes, as in ""ripens"" but for fruit? Or third person? But it's a valid word? 
- ""RICES"": but C is not allowed? 
- ""RIDES"": but D is not allowed? 
- ""RIFLE"": doesn't fit because E must be at index3? But in ""RIFLE"", index3 is L? So no? 
- ""RINSE"": but N is not allowed? 
- ""RIPED"": not a word? 
- ""RIVER"": R I V E R? Then V at index2? And R at index0 and index4? Duplicate R? And we avoid? But let's see? 
- ""RISER"": R I S E R? Then S at index2? And R at index0 and index4? Again duplicate? 

But we can try without duplicate? So ""RIPES"": R I P E S? Then P at index2? S at index4? And no duplicate? And letters: R, I, P, E, S? Avoids C,A,N,T,D? So we can try? 

But we know that in the secret word, R might be at index0? Or index4? So if we put R at index0? And the secret word has R at index0? Then it would be marked correct? If not? Then it might be marked as wrong? Or if the secret word has R at index4? Then the R at index0 would be marked as wrong? Because it's in the word but wrong position? But we have S at index4? So if the secret word has R at index4? Then S at index4 would be marked as not in word? Or if the secret word has R at index0? Then S at index4 might be marked as not in word? Or if it is? 

But we are testing: if we get R at index0 correct? Then we know R is at index0? And then we only have to find the letter at index2 and index4? But we have S at index4? So we get feedback on S? 

Similarly, if R at index0 is marked as wrong? Then we know R must be at index4? Because we have only two possibilities? And then we can use that in the next guess? 

So ""RIPES"" seems a good candidate? 

But what about the letter at index2? We are testing P? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at index4? For example: ? I ? E R? 

Then the first letter and the third letter are new? 

For example: ""WISER"": W I S E R? Then W at index0? S at index2? R at index4? And no duplicates? Avoids C,A,N,T,D? 

But we know that in the secret word, E is at index3? So ""WISER"" has E at index3? And R at index4? So pattern: W I S E R? 

Then we test: if R is at index4? If it is? Then we get it correct? If not? Then we know R must be at index0? 

But we have two options? So which one to choose? 

We can choose either? But let's see which one covers more common letters? 

In ""RIPES"": letters R, I, P, E, S? We already know I and E? So we are testing R, P, S? But R we are testing at index0? P at index2? S at index4? 

In ""WISER"": W, I, S, E, R? Testing W, S, R? With R at index4? 

Both are valid? But ""RIPES"" has P and S? ""WISER"" has W and S? P is more common than W? So ""RIPES"" might be better? 

But we also have to consider that if we put R at index0? And it is correct? Then we have the first letter? And then we only have to find index2 and index4? But we have P and S? 

Similarly, if we put R at index4? And it is correct? Then we have the last letter? And then we have to find index0 and index2? 

But we have to choose one? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have R? But then we don't test R? But we know R is in the word? So we should test? 

But we can also choose a word that has R at index0? And also tests other common letters? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has the letter at index2? And then we can get information about that? And also, we can set R at one of the ends? 

But I think ""RIPES"" is fine? 

But let's see the feedback from the second guess: we have I at index1 correct? And E at index3 correct? So we have two fixed? And we know R is in the word? But not at index2? So we are testing index0 and index4? 

So in ""RIPES"", we are putting R at index0? And S at index4? And P at index2? 

If the secret word has R at index0? Then the first letter R would be marked correct? And then we know the word is R I ? E ? 

Then we have to find the letter at index2 and index4? We have P at index2? If P is in the word? Then we get feedback? Similarly for S? 

If the secret word does not have R at index0? Then the R at index0 would be marked as wrong? But we know R is in the word? So it must be at index4? Then we know the word is ? I ? E R? 

And then we have P at index2? And S at index4? But if R is at index4? Then S at index4 would be marked as not in word? Because the secret word has R at index4? So S is not in the word? Or if S is in the word? But at another position? But we don't know? 

But we get feedback? 

So it's acceptable? 

But to avoid confusion? We can choose a word that has R at index0? And then the other positions with letters that are not likely to be at the ends? But I think it's fine? 

Another word: ""RIPEN"" is not allowed? Because N is bad? 

""RICES"" not allowed? 

""RIDES"" not allowed? 

""RIFLE"" doesn't fit? 

""RISEN"": R I S E N? But N is bad? 

""RIPED"" not a word? 

So ""RIPES"" or ""RIVER"" (but duplicate)? 

Or ""RISER"" (duplicate)? 

Or ""RIDER"" (duplicate and D is bad)? 

So ""RIPES"" seems the best? 

But let's consider ""WISER"": if we put R at index4? Then we test W at index0? S at index2? 

If R is at index4? Then we get it correct? And then we know the word is ? I ? E R? And we have W at index0? S at index2? 

If R is not at index4? Then we know it must be at index0? And then we have W at index0? Which would be marked as not in word? Or wrong? 

But we get information? 

But ""WISER"" has W? Which is less common? So ""RIPES"" with P and S? More common? 

But we can also try ""PRIZE""? But Z is less common? 

Or ""BRINE""? But B is new? But N is bad? 

So I think ""RIPES"" is a good choice? 

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid? 

""RIPES"" is a valid word? Meaning the third person singular of ""ripe""? Or as in fruit? But it's accepted? 

So I'll go with ""RIPES"". 

But let's see: in ""RIPES"", we have E at index3? Which is fixed? And I at index1? Fixed? So we are guessing: 
- R at index0? 
- P at index2? 
- S at index4? 

And we avoid C,A,N,T,D? 

So feedback will tell us: 
- If R is at index0? 
- If P is in the word? And if so, where? 
- If S is in the word? And if so, where? 

And if R is not at index0? Then we know R must be at index4? 

So we can proceed? 

Therefore, third guess: ""RIPES"" 

But wait, what if the secret word has P at index2? Then we get it? Or if not? 

But we have to try? 

So <guess>ripes</guess> 

But let me double-check the pattern: 
Position 0: R 
Position 1: I (fixed) 
Position 2: P 
Position 3: E (fixed) 
Position 4: S 

Yes. 

We'll see the feedback.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(in word, wrong position), A(not in word), N(not in word), E(in word, wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - R and E are in the secret word.  
    - C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  
    - R is not at position 1 (index 1), and E is not at position 4 (index 4).  

- **Guess 2: ""tired""** → Feedback: T(not in word), I(correct position), R(in word, wrong position), E(correct position), D(not in word).  
  - This reveals:  
    - I is at position 1 (index 1) and E is at position 3 (index 3) in the secret word.  
    - T and D are not in the secret word.  
    - R is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2) (since it was marked as wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern is: `[?] I [?] E [?]` (positions: index 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).  
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
  - Position 1 (index 1) = `I`  
  - Position 3 (index 3) = `E`  
- **R must be in the word** but cannot be at:  
  - Position 1 (from ""crane"" feedback)  
  - Position 2 (from ""tired"" feedback)  
  - Since position 3 is fixed as `E`, R must be at position 0 or 4.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, T, D (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Goal for next guess**:  
  - Test R at position 0 (index 0) to resolve its location (if R is not at position 0, it must be at position 4).  
  - Introduce new common letters to test the remaining unknown positions (index 2 and index 4).  
  - Avoid excluded letters and reuse known correct positions (I at index 1, E at index 3).  

### Chosen Guess: ""RIPES""
- **Word breakdown**:  
  - Position 0: `R` (tests if R is at index 0)  
  - Position 1: `I` (fixed, known correct)  
  - Position 2: `P` (new letter, tests index 2)  
  - Position 3: `E` (fixed, known correct)  
  - Position 4: `S` (new letter, tests index 4)  
- **Why ""RIPES""?**  
  - Tests R at position 0: If correct, R is at index 0; if wrong, R must be at index 4.  
  - Introduces common letters `P` and `S` to gather information on positions 2 and 4.  
  - Avoids excluded letters (C, A, N, T, D).  
  - Uses a valid 5-letter word with high-frequency letters.  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If R is at position 0, feedback will confirm it (✓).  
  - If R is not at position 0, feedback will show it as wrong position (-) or not in word (x), confirming R must be at position 4.  
  - Feedback on `P` and `S` will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.  

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for R while testing new letters in the remaining unknown positions.",Guess 3: ripes -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,RISER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. It covers vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C(x) -> C is not in the secret word
R(-) -> R is in the secret word but in the wrong position
A(x) -> A is not in the secret word
N(x) -> N is not in the secret word
E(-) -> E is in the secret word but in the wrong position

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in the positions they were guessed (position 2 for R and position 5 for E).
- The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that includes R and E, and excludes C, A, N.

Since R and E are in the word but not in the same positions, we need to try them in different positions.

Also, we should avoid using C, A, N in the new guess.

Consider the positions:
- In ""crane"", R was at position 2 (index 1). Since it's marked as wrong position, in the secret word R cannot be at index 1.
- E was at position 5 (index 4). Since it's marked as wrong position, in the secret word E cannot be at index 4.

We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

Idea: We should try a word that has R and E, and put them in positions we haven't tried.

Available positions for R: cannot be index 1. So possible indices: 0, 2, 3, 4.
Similarly for E: cannot be index 4, so possible indices: 0,1,2,3.

We also want to include other common letters to maximize information. Avoid C, A, N.

Common letters: S, T, O, L, I, D, H, U, etc.

Let me try to form a word.

Option: ""ROUTE""
- R at position 0 (which is allowed because we haven't tried R at 0 yet)
- E at position 4? But wait, our feedback says E cannot be at position 4? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 4. So using E at position 4 again might not be ideal because we know it's not there. However, we could try a different position.

But note: We must not repeat the same position for E? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know it's not at position 4. So better to put E in a new position.

In ""ROUTE"": R at 0, E at 4? But E at 4 we already know is wrong? So let's not put E at 4.

Another word: ""DRIVE""
- D, R, I, V, E
- R at index 1? Wait, R was previously at index 1 and we know that's wrong. So we must move R to a different position? Actually, in our first guess R was at index 1 and it was marked wrong position, meaning in the secret word R is not at index 1. So in ""DRIVE"", R is at index 1 again? That would be the same position, so we shouldn't put R at index 1.

Thus, we must avoid R at index 1 and E at index 4.

Suggestion: ""RISKY"", but R is at index 1? We must avoid that.

Let me try ""PRIDE"":
- P at 0 (new letter)
- R at 1 -> but: we know R cannot be at index 1? So avoiding that.

So we need R at position other than 1.

Idea: put R at position 0 or position 2 or 3 or 4.

Similarly, put E at index 0,1,2,3.

Also, we know the secret word has 5 letters and contains R and E.

Possible word: ""DRIVE"" has R at index 1 which is bad.

Alternative: ""GRIPE""
- G at 0?
- R at 1 -> again index1, bad.

We need a word where R is not at the second letter.

Another: ""EAGER"", but we know A is not in the word? And E is at 0 and 4? We know E is not at 4? Also, we must avoid A.

Avoid A: so skip.

Try: ""RODEO""? Contains A? R O D E O - not 5 distinct? But even then, O repeated? And E at position 3? But we know E exists.

But feedback: Also, we can try words even with duplicates? Actually, the rules don't say we must avoid duplicates? But the word must be a valid English word.

However, we know the secret word has 5 letters, but it might have duplicates? The feedback doesn't forbid that.

But in the example, duplicates would show up. However, in our case, we don't know.

But to be safe, I think we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

But ""RODEO"" has two O's? And we don't know about O.

But let's avoid for now.

Word: ""TIRED""
- T at 0 (common letter)
- I at 1
- R at 2? That's a new position for R (index 2). Previously R was at index1, now index2? That's good because we avoid the wrong position.
- E at 3? Also, E at index 3? Previously E at index 4. Now index3? That's allowed because it's a new position.
- D at 4? 

So ""TIRED"" has R at position 3? Let's check:
Position 0: T
Position 1: I
Position 2: R
Position 3: E
Position 4: D

But R is at index 2? And E at index 3.

We know R and E are in the word, just not in the first positions we guessed.

Also, we avoid C, A, N.

So ""TIRED"" seems a good choice? Is it valid? Yes.

But wait, are we allowed to use letters we know are not in the word? We know C, A, N are not in the word? So yes, but ""TIRED"" doesn't contain C, A, N.

What about the word? Valid English word.

Alternatively, another word: ""QUERY"", but Q is less common.

Or ""WRECK"", but we have C? Wait, we know C is not in the word? So we must avoid C? Because we were told C(x) -> not in word.

Yes! Important: Since C was marked as not in the word, we must not use C again. Similarly, A and N.

So in ""TIRED"": Letters T, I, R, E, D. None of these are C, A, or N. So it's okay.

Another candidate: ""SPIRE"", which has S, P, I, R, E? But E is at the end? Position 4? We know that in secret word E is not at position 4? So if we use E at position 4, it might be marked wrong position again? To save a guess, better not to put E at position4? We already know position4 is wrong? So we can avoid that.

Therefore, in ""TIRED"", E is at position3? That's position we haven't tried? So that's good.

Similarly, R is at position2? Previously R was at position1? We can try position2.

Another word: ""PROSE""? But has O? And E at 4? We don't know about O? But E at 4 we know is wrong? And O is new.

But I think ""TIRED"" is fine.

Let me check: With ""TIRED"":

- If the secret word has R at index0? Then in our guess we have R at index2? Then the feedback would mark R correctly? If it's at the right location? Or if at another, wrong location.

But we are trying to get information.

Since we already know R and E, we might want to cover more letters.

In ""TIRED"", we have T, I, R, E, D.

Among these, R and E we know exist? But others are new? So we get info on T, I, D.

Perfect.

Also, avoiding known bad letters.

So I think ""TIRED"" is a good second guess.

But wait: Was R already used? Actually, we can reuse letters? But with position shifts.

Yes.

Alternatively, ""SLEPT"", then E at position1? And S, L, P, T? Then E at index1? Previously we tried index4? So index1 is new? But then what about R? We forgot to include R? Oh, we know R is in the word, so we should include it? Because we have limited tries? And we must find where R is.

Yes! Since R must be in the word, we should try to include it in this guess to pin down its position.

Similarly for E.

Therefore, we must include both R and E in the guess? Because they are known to be in the secret word? But we don't have to? Actually, no rule forces us? But if we don't, we might not get information about them? Since we already know they exist? But we have to find their positions.

So best to include both.

How about ""DRIVER""? Too long? We need 5-letter.

5-letter: ""RIDER""? Has two R's? Then R exists? And E? No E in ""RIDER"". So miss E? Then we wouldn't test E positions? But we know E exists? So we can leave E for next? But we have E to position? Similarly R? So better include both? Since we have to place both anyway.

Another word: ""PRIME"", P,R,I,M,E? Then R at index1? We know R cannot be at index? Index1? So avoid index1.

Put R at index1? But that would be the same position? And we know this position is wrong? So the feedback would again be (-) for R? Because it exists but wrong position? But we already know that? So we don't get new information about R? Unless we move it? So better to change the position.

Therefore, we should use a word that has R in a position that we have not tried? That includes index0,2,3,4? Similarly for E, avoid index4? So try index0,1,2,3.

Now, with two constraints: R not at index1, E not at index4? Plus include both R and E? With E at a new position.

So ""TIRED"" has:
Index0: T
Index1: I
Index2: R
Index3: E
Index4: D

Thus:
- R is at index2? Which is new? So we test R at position3? [counting from 0? Actually positions: 0,1,2,3,4]
- E is at index3? Previously we tried index4? So we test E at position4? No? Previously E was at position5 (if counting from1)? But in code, positions? 
In ""crane"": positions: 0:C, 1:R, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E. Then E was index4? And now in ""TIRED"", E is index3? Great.

Also, includes new letters: T, I, D.

Therefore, I think ""TIRED"" is a solid second guess.

So my guess: TIRED

We'll submit it.

<guess>tired</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N are not in the secret word (marked as 'x').
- R and E are in the secret word, but not at positions 1 and 4 (in ""crane"", R was at position 1 and marked '-', E was at position 4 and marked '-').

For the second guess:
- The word must include R and E since they are in the secret word.
- R cannot be at position 1 again (to avoid repeating a known wrong position).
- E cannot be at position 4 again (to avoid repeating a known wrong position).
- Avoid using C, A, or N.
- Aim for new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) to maximize information.

The word ""tired"" works well:
- Positions: T at 0 (new position/letter), I at 1 (new letter), R at 2 (new position for R), E at 3 (new position for E, avoiding position 4), D at 4 (new letter).
- Avoids C, A, N.
- Tests R in position 2 and E in position 3, while introducing new letters T, I, D.

This guess helps narrow down positions for R and E and provides information on other letters.

<guess>tired</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: not in word (x)
- R: in word but wrong position (-)
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-)

Second guess: ""tired""
- T: not in word (x)
- I: correct position (✓) at index 1 (second letter)
- R: in word but wrong position (-) - note: in ""tired"", R is at index 2
- E: correct position (✓) at index 3 (fourth letter)
- D: not in word (x)

What we know so far:
1. The secret word has I as the second letter (index 1) and E as the fourth letter (index 3). So the word pattern is: _ I _ E _
2. The word contains R, but not at the positions we've tried: 
   - In ""crane"", R was at index 1 (second position) and was wrong -> so R is not at index 1.
   - In ""tired"", R was at index 2 (third position) and was wrong -> so R is not at index 2.
   Therefore, R must be at index 0, 3, or 4? But wait, index 3 is already taken by E? So R cannot be at index 3? Because index 3 is E? So R must be at index 0 or 4? But index 4 is the last letter? And we haven't tried R at index 0 or 4.

   However, note: in the pattern _ I _ E _, the positions are:
   index0: unknown
   index1: I (fixed)
   index2: unknown
   index3: E (fixed)
   index4: unknown

   So R must be in one of the unknown positions: index0, index2, or index4? But we have tried R at index2 (in ""tired"") and it was wrong? So R is not at index2. Therefore, R must be at index0 or index4.

3. The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, D (from the x's).

4. We also know that E is at index3, so we don't need to test that again? But we have it fixed.

Now, we need to form a word that fits the pattern: _ I _ E _

And we know the letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, T, D.

Also, we must include R? Because we know R is in the word? But we haven't placed it yet? So we have to include R in one of the unknown positions: index0, index2, or index4? But index2 is already tried? So only index0 or index4? But note: we have two unknowns: index0 and index4? And index2 is also unknown? But we tried R at index2 and it was wrong? So R is not at index2? Therefore, R must be at index0 or index4.

But wait, the pattern has three unknown positions: index0, index2, index4? But we know R must be in one of them? And we have two positions left? Actually, we have three positions? But R can only be in one? So the other two positions are for other letters.

But we also know that the word has exactly 5 letters? And we have fixed I and E? So the other three are unknown? But we know one of them must be R? And the other two are new letters? But we have to avoid C, A, N, T, D.

So the word pattern: [R?] I [some letter] E [R?]

But R can only be at one position? So either:
- If R is at index0: then the word is R I ? E ?
- If R is at index4: then the word is ? I ? E R

But we don't know which? So we need to test.

Also, the middle letter at index2 is unknown? And must be a letter that we haven't tried? And not in the exclusion list.

Now, for the next guess, we want to maximize information? But we have two possibilities? So we can try to cover both? Or we can try a word that has R at index0? Or at index4? And also test new letters.

But note: we have only 6 tries? So we need to be efficient.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at index0? And then if it's not, then R must be at index4? But we can do that in two steps? But we can also try to cover more letters.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and include R? And avoid the bad letters.

First, if R is at index0: then the word starts with ""RI"" and then any letter (not C,A,N,T,D) and then ""E"" and then any letter (not C,A,N,T,D). But the last letter could be R? But if R is at index0, then it cannot be at index4? Because we don't know if the word has two R's? But the feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates? So it could have two R's? But we don't know? So we must consider.

But in our case, we know R is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? So we have to be cautious.

Similarly, if R is at index4, then the word ends with ""R"", and the first letter is not R? But again, could be two R's? But we don't know.

To simplify, let's assume no duplicates for now? But we can't assume? So we have to consider.

But to maximize information, we can try a word that has R at index0? And then new letters? And see.

But we also have to fill the pattern.

List of possible words? But we don't have the dictionary? So we have to think of common words.

Common words with pattern _ I _ E _ and avoiding C,A,N,T,D.

Available letters: we can use B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common ones.

We also know that R must be at index0 or index4? So we can try one of the cases.

But we can also try a word that doesn't have R? But we know R is in the word? So we must include it? Because if we don't, we might not get information about its position? But we already know it's in the word? So we can skip including it? But then we don't know where it is? So better to include it? Since we have to find the position.

So let's try to form a word with R at index0? And then we can test that.

For example: ""RIPER""? But has two R's? And E at index3? But we have E fixed? And the pattern is R I ? E R? Then index4 is R? But we don't know if R is at index4? And also, we have to avoid D? But ""RIPER"" has R at 0 and 4? And P at 2? But is it valid? ""RIPER"" is a word? Meaning one who ripes? Or is it ""ripper""? No, ""riper"" is a word? But let's see: R I P E R? That's 5 letters? But we have two R's? And we don't know if the secret word has two R's? But we can try? But we also have to avoid T? T is not in ""RIPER""? But we have to avoid D? D is not in? But we have to avoid C,A,N,T,D? So ""RIPER"" has none of these? But we have two R's? And we know R is in the word? But we don't know if it's duplicated? So it's possible? But let's see the feedback? We might get confused? Because if the secret word has only one R? Then the R at index4 might be marked as not in word? Or if it's in the word but wrong position? But we have R at index0? Which we are testing? And if the secret word has R at index0? Then it would be marked correct? But if the secret word has R at index4? Then the R at index0 might be marked as wrong? And R at index4? But we don't have R at index4 in the guess? Wait, in ""RIPER"", we have R at index0 and index4? So if the secret word has R at index0? Then the first R is correct? And the last R? If the secret word has only one R? Then the last R would be marked as not in word? Or if it has two? Then both might be marked? But we don't know? So it might be messy? But we can try? However, we have limited guesses? So better to avoid duplicates? To keep it simple? So let's avoid using R twice? Unless necessary? But we can try a word with R only once? And at a new position? Which is either index0 or index4? And then the other positions with new letters.

So for example, if we put R at index0: then the word is R I ? E ? 

The third letter (index2) must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,D}? And the last letter (index4) must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,D}? And we want to use common letters? To maximize chance of hitting.

Similarly, if we put R at index4: then the word is ? I ? E R? And the first and third letters are new.

But we don't know which? So we can choose one? Or we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But that might be hard? Because we have to have R at one of them? But we can only put R at one position? So we have to choose.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R at index0? And then if it's not? Then next time we put at index4? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can do that.

But we can also try to cover more letters? So let's try R at index0? And then use two new common letters? For index2 and index4.

For example: ""RIPEN""? But N is not allowed? Because we know N is not in the word? From first guess? So avoid N.

""RIPED""? But D is not allowed? And also, ""riped"" is not a word? It's ""ripened"" without n? Not valid.

""RICES""? But C and S? C is not allowed? And also, we avoid C.

""RIFLE""? R I F L E? Then pattern: R I F L E? But we have E at index4? But in the pattern, we have E fixed at index3? But in ""RIFLE"", E is at index4? But we need E at index3? So that doesn't match? Because we know E must be at index3? So the word must have E at index3? So the fourth letter must be E? So we cannot change that? So in our guess, we must have the second letter I and the fourth letter E? So the pattern is fixed: _ I _ E _

Therefore, for ""RIFLE"": it would be R I F L E? Then the fourth letter is L? Not E? So that doesn't work? Because we must have E at index3? So the word must be of the form ? I ? E ?

So we cannot use ""RIFLE"" because it has E at the end? Not at index3.

So we must have the fourth letter as E? So the word must end with E? No? The fourth letter is E? But the fifth letter is still unknown? So the word is ... E at the fourth position? And then a fifth letter? So it's not necessarily ending with E? For example, ""RIPEN"" has E at index3? And then N at index4? But we know N is not in the word? So we cannot use that.

So let's think of words that fit: ? I ? E ?

With R at index0: so ""R I ? E ?""

Common words: 
- ""RIPER"": but has two R's? And E at index3? Then last letter R? So ""R I P E R""? But we don't know if R is duplicated? And we avoid duplicates? So skip? 
- ""RIPES"": R I P E S? Then S at index4? And P at index2? Avoids C,A,N,T,D? So S is new? P is new? So we can try? But is ""RIPES"" a word? Yes, as in ""ripens"" but for fruit? Or third person? But it's a valid word? 
- ""RICES"": but C is not allowed? 
- ""RIDES"": but D is not allowed? 
- ""RIFLE"": doesn't fit because E must be at index3? But in ""RIFLE"", index3 is L? So no? 
- ""RINSE"": but N is not allowed? 
- ""RIPED"": not a word? 
- ""RIVER"": R I V E R? Then V at index2? And R at index0 and index4? Duplicate R? And we avoid? But let's see? 
- ""RISER"": R I S E R? Then S at index2? And R at index0 and index4? Again duplicate? 

But we can try without duplicate? So ""RIPES"": R I P E S? Then P at index2? S at index4? And no duplicate? And letters: R, I, P, E, S? Avoids C,A,N,T,D? So we can try? 

But we know that in the secret word, R might be at index0? Or index4? So if we put R at index0? And the secret word has R at index0? Then it would be marked correct? If not? Then it might be marked as wrong? Or if the secret word has R at index4? Then the R at index0 would be marked as wrong? Because it's in the word but wrong position? But we have S at index4? So if the secret word has R at index4? Then S at index4 would be marked as not in word? Or if the secret word has R at index0? Then S at index4 might be marked as not in word? Or if it is? 

But we are testing: if we get R at index0 correct? Then we know R is at index0? And then we only have to find the letter at index2 and index4? But we have S at index4? So we get feedback on S? 

Similarly, if R at index0 is marked as wrong? Then we know R must be at index4? Because we have only two possibilities? And then we can use that in the next guess? 

So ""RIPES"" seems a good candidate? 

But what about the letter at index2? We are testing P? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that has R at index4? For example: ? I ? E R? 

Then the first letter and the third letter are new? 

For example: ""WISER"": W I S E R? Then W at index0? S at index2? R at index4? And no duplicates? Avoids C,A,N,T,D? 

But we know that in the secret word, E is at index3? So ""WISER"" has E at index3? And R at index4? So pattern: W I S E R? 

Then we test: if R is at index4? If it is? Then we get it correct? If not? Then we know R must be at index0? 

But we have two options? So which one to choose? 

We can choose either? But let's see which one covers more common letters? 

In ""RIPES"": letters R, I, P, E, S? We already know I and E? So we are testing R, P, S? But R we are testing at index0? P at index2? S at index4? 

In ""WISER"": W, I, S, E, R? Testing W, S, R? With R at index4? 

Both are valid? But ""RIPES"" has P and S? ""WISER"" has W and S? P is more common than W? So ""RIPES"" might be better? 

But we also have to consider that if we put R at index0? And it is correct? Then we have the first letter? And then we only have to find index2 and index4? But we have P and S? 

Similarly, if we put R at index4? And it is correct? Then we have the last letter? And then we have to find index0 and index2? 

But we have to choose one? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't have R? But then we don't test R? But we know R is in the word? So we should test? 

But we can also choose a word that has R at index0? And also tests other common letters? 

Another idea: we can choose a word that has the letter at index2? And then we can get information about that? And also, we can set R at one of the ends? 

But I think ""RIPES"" is fine? 

But let's see the feedback from the second guess: we have I at index1 correct? And E at index3 correct? So we have two fixed? And we know R is in the word? But not at index2? So we are testing index0 and index4? 

So in ""RIPES"", we are putting R at index0? And S at index4? And P at index2? 

If the secret word has R at index0? Then the first letter R would be marked correct? And then we know the word is R I ? E ? 

Then we have to find the letter at index2 and index4? We have P at index2? If P is in the word? Then we get feedback? Similarly for S? 

If the secret word does not have R at index0? Then the R at index0 would be marked as wrong? But we know R is in the word? So it must be at index4? Then we know the word is ? I ? E R? 

And then we have P at index2? And S at index4? But if R is at index4? Then S at index4 would be marked as not in word? Because the secret word has R at index4? So S is not in the word? Or if S is in the word? But at another position? But we don't know? 

But we get feedback? 

So it's acceptable? 

But to avoid confusion? We can choose a word that has R at index0? And then the other positions with letters that are not likely to be at the ends? But I think it's fine? 

Another word: ""RIPEN"" is not allowed? Because N is bad? 

""RICES"" not allowed? 

""RIDES"" not allowed? 

""RIFLE"" doesn't fit? 

""RISEN"": R I S E N? But N is bad? 

""RIPED"" not a word? 

So ""RIPES"" or ""RIVER"" (but duplicate)? 

Or ""RISER"" (duplicate)? 

Or ""RIDER"" (duplicate and D is bad)? 

So ""RIPES"" seems the best? 

But let's consider ""WISER"": if we put R at index4? Then we test W at index0? S at index2? 

If R is at index4? Then we get it correct? And then we know the word is ? I ? E R? And we have W at index0? S at index2? 

If R is not at index4? Then we know it must be at index0? And then we have W at index0? Which would be marked as not in word? Or wrong? 

But we get information? 

But ""WISER"" has W? Which is less common? So ""RIPES"" with P and S? More common? 

But we can also try ""PRIZE""? But Z is less common? 

Or ""BRINE""? But B is new? But N is bad? 

So I think ""RIPES"" is a good choice? 

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid? 

""RIPES"" is a valid word? Meaning the third person singular of ""ripe""? Or as in fruit? But it's accepted? 

So I'll go with ""RIPES"". 

But let's see: in ""RIPES"", we have E at index3? Which is fixed? And I at index1? Fixed? So we are guessing: 
- R at index0? 
- P at index2? 
- S at index4? 

And we avoid C,A,N,T,D? 

So feedback will tell us: 
- If R is at index0? 
- If P is in the word? And if so, where? 
- If S is in the word? And if so, where? 

And if R is not at index0? Then we know R must be at index4? 

So we can proceed? 

Therefore, third guess: ""RIPES"" 

But wait, what if the secret word has P at index2? Then we get it? Or if not? 

But we have to try? 

So <guess>ripes</guess> 

But let me double-check the pattern: 
Position 0: R 
Position 1: I (fixed) 
Position 2: P 
Position 3: E (fixed) 
Position 4: S 

Yes. 

We'll see the feedback.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(in word, wrong position), A(not in word), N(not in word), E(in word, wrong position).  
  - This reveals:  
    - R and E are in the secret word.  
    - C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  
    - R is not at position 1 (index 1), and E is not at position 4 (index 4).  

- **Guess 2: ""tired""** → Feedback: T(not in word), I(correct position), R(in word, wrong position), E(correct position), D(not in word).  
  - This reveals:  
    - I is at position 1 (index 1) and E is at position 3 (index 3) in the secret word.  
    - T and D are not in the secret word.  
    - R is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2) (since it was marked as wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
- The secret word pattern is: `[?] I [?] E [?]` (positions: index 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).  
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
  - Position 1 (index 1) = `I`  
  - Position 3 (index 3) = `E`  
- **R must be in the word** but cannot be at:  
  - Position 1 (from ""crane"" feedback)  
  - Position 2 (from ""tired"" feedback)  
  - Since position 3 is fixed as `E`, R must be at position 0 or 4.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, T, D (cannot appear anywhere).  
- **Goal for next guess**:  
  - Test R at position 0 (index 0) to resolve its location (if R is not at position 0, it must be at position 4).  
  - Introduce new common letters to test the remaining unknown positions (index 2 and index 4).  
  - Avoid excluded letters and reuse known correct positions (I at index 1, E at index 3).  

### Chosen Guess: ""RIPES""
- **Word breakdown**:  
  - Position 0: `R` (tests if R is at index 0)  
  - Position 1: `I` (fixed, known correct)  
  - Position 2: `P` (new letter, tests index 2)  
  - Position 3: `E` (fixed, known correct)  
  - Position 4: `S` (new letter, tests index 4)  
- **Why ""RIPES""?**  
  - Tests R at position 0: If correct, R is at index 0; if wrong, R must be at index 4.  
  - Introduces common letters `P` and `S` to gather information on positions 2 and 4.  
  - Avoids excluded letters (C, A, N, T, D).  
  - Uses a valid 5-letter word with high-frequency letters.  
- **Expected outcomes**:  
  - If R is at position 0, feedback will confirm it (✓).  
  - If R is not at position 0, feedback will show it as wrong position (-) or not in word (x), confirming R must be at position 4.  
  - Feedback on `P` and `S` will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.  

This guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for R while testing new letters in the remaining unknown positions.

Since it\'s marked as wrong position, in the secret word R cannot be at index 1.\n- E was at position 5 (index 4). Since it\'s marked as wrong position, in the secret word E cannot be at index 4.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.\n\nIdea: We should try a word that has R and E, and put them in positions we haven\'t tried.\n\nAvailable positions for R: cannot be index 1. So possible indices: 0, 2, 3, 4.\nSimilarly for E: cannot be index 4, so possible indices: 0,1,2,3.\n\nWe also want to include other common letters to maximize information.

But wait, our feedback says E cannot be at position 4? Actually, the feedback says E is in the word but not at position 4. So using E at position 4 again might not be ideal because we know it\'s not there. However, we could try a different position.\n\nBut note: We must not repeat the same position for E? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we already know it\'s not at position 4. So better to put E in a new position.\n\nIn ""ROUTE"": R at 0, E at 4? But E at 4 we already know is wrong? So let\'s not put E at 4.\n\nAnother word: ""DRIVE""\n- D, R, I, V, E\n- R at index 1? Wait, R was previously at index 1 and we know that\'s wrong. So we must move R to a different position? Actually, in our first guess R was at index 1 and it was marked wrong position, meaning in the secret word R is not at index 1. So in ""DRIVE"", R is at index 1 again? That would be the same position, so we shouldn\'t put R at index 1.\n\nThus, we must avoid R at index 1 and E at index 4.\n\nSuggestion: ""RISKY"", but R is at index 1? We must avoid that.\n\nLet me try ""PRIDE"":\n- P at 0 (new letter)\n- R at 1 -> but: we know R cannot be at index 1? So avoiding that.\n\nSo we need R at position other than 1.\n\nIdea: put R at position 0 or position 2 or 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, put E at index 0,1,2,3.\n\nAlso, we know the secret word has 5 letters and contains R and E.\n\nPossible word: ""DRIVE"" has R at index 1 which is bad.\n\nAlternative: ""GRIPE""\n- G at 0?\n- R at 1 -> again index1, bad.\n\nWe need a word where R is not at the second letter.\n\nAnother: ""EAGER"", but we know A is not in the word? And E is at 0 and 4? We know E is not at 4? Also, we must avoid A.\n\nAvoid A: so skip.\n\nTry: ""RODEO""? Contains A? R O D E O - not 5 distinct? But even then, O repeated? And E at position 3? But we know E exists.\n\nBut feedback: Also, we can try words even with duplicates? Actually, the rules don\'t say we must avoid duplicates? But the word must be a valid English word.\n\nHowever, we know the secret word has 5 letters, but it might have duplicates? The feedback doesn\'t forbid that.\n\nBut in the example, duplicates would show up. However, in our case, we don\'t know.\n\nBut to be safe, I think we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\nBut ""RODEO"" has two O\'s? And we don\'t know about O.\n\nBut let\'s avoid for now.\n\nWord: ""TIRED""\n- T at 0 (common letter)\n- I at 1\n- R at 2? That\'s a new position for R (index 2). Previously R was at index1, now index2? That\'s good because we avoid the wrong position.\n- E at 3? Also, E at index 3? Previously E at index 4. Now index3? That\'s allowed because it\'s a new position.\n- D at 4? \n\nSo ""TIRED"" has R at position 3? Let\'s check:\nPosition 0: T\nPosition 1: I\nPosition 2: R\nPosition 3: E\nPosition 4: D\n\nBut R is at index 2? And E at index 3.\n\nWe know R and E are in the word, just not in the first positions we guessed.\n\nAlso, we avoid C, A, N.\n\nSo ""TIRED"" seems a good choice? Is it valid? Yes.\n\nBut wait, are we allowed to use letters we know are not in the word? We know C, A, N are not in the word? So yes, but ""TIRED"" doesn\'t contain C, A, N.\n\nWhat about the word? Valid English word.\n\nAlternatively, another word: ""QUERY"", but Q is less common.\n\nOr ""WRECK"", but we have C? Wait, we know C is not in the word? So we must avoid C? Because we were told C(x) -> not in word.\n\nYes! Important: Since C was marked as not in the word, we must not use C again. Similarly, A and N.\n\nSo in ""TIRED"": Letters T, I, R, E, D. None of these are C, A, or N. So it\'s okay.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SPIRE"", which has S, P, I, R, E? But E is at the end? Position 4? We know that in secret word E is not at position 4? So if we use E at position 4, it might be marked wrong position again? To save a guess, better not to put E at position4? We already know position4 is wrong? So we can avoid that.\n\nTherefore, in ""TIRED"", E is at position3? That\'s position we haven\'t tried? So that\'s good.\n\nSimilarly, R is at position2? Previously R was at position1? We can try position2.\n\nAnother word: ""PROSE""? But has O? And E at 4? We don\'t know about O? But E at 4 we know is wrong? And O is new.\n\nBut I think ""TIRED"" is fine.\n\nLet me check: With ""TIRED"":\n\n- If the secret word has R at index0? Then in our guess we have R at index2? Then the feedback would mark R correctly? If it\'s at the right location? Or if at another, wrong location.\n\nBut we are trying to get information.\n\nSince we already know R and E, we might want to cover more letters.\n\nIn ""TIRED"", we have T, I, R, E, D.\n\nAmong these, R and E we know exist? But others are new? So we get info on T, I, D.\n\nPerfect.\n\nAlso, avoiding known bad letters.\n\nSo I think ""TIRED"" is a good second guess.\n\nBut wait: Was R already used? Actually, we can reuse letters? But with position shifts.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLEPT"", then E at position1? And S, L, P, T? Then E at index1? Previously we tried index4? So index1 is new? But then what about R? We forgot to include R? Oh, we know R is in the word, so we should include it? Because we have limited tries? And we must find where R is.\n\nYes! Since R must be in the word, we should try to include it in this guess to pin down its position.\n\nSimilarly for E.\n\nTherefore, we must include both R and E in the guess? Because they are known to be in the secret word? But we don\'t have to? Actually, no rule forces us? But if we don\'t, we might not get information about them? Since we already know they exist? But we have to find their positions.\n\nSo best to include both.\n\nHow about ""DRIVER""? Too long? We need 5-letter.\n\n5-letter: ""RIDER""? Has two R\'s? Then R exists? And E? No E in ""RIDER"". So miss E? Then we wouldn\'t test E positions? But we know E exists? So we can leave E for next? But we have E to position? Similarly R? So better include both? Since we have to place both anyway.\n\nAnother word: ""PRIME"", P,R,I,M,E? Then R at index1? We know R cannot be at index? Index1? So avoid index1.\n\nPut R at index1? But that would be the same position? And we know this position is wrong? So the feedback would again be (-) for R? Because it exists but wrong position? But we already know that? So we don\'t get new information about R? Unless we move it? So better to change the position.\n\nTherefore, we should use a word that has R in a position that we have not tried? That includes index0,2,3,4? Similarly for E, avoid index4? So try index0,1,2,3.\n\nNow, with two constraints: R not at index1, E not at index4? Plus include both R and E? With E at a new position.\n\nSo ""TIRED"" has:\nIndex0: T\nIndex1: I\nIndex2: R\nIndex3: E\nIndex4: D\n\nThus:\n- R is at index2? Which is new? So we test R at position3? [counting from 0? Actually positions: 0,1,2,3,4]\n- E is at index3? Previously we tried index4? So we test E at position4? No? Previously E was at position5 (if counting from1)? But in code, positions? \nIn ""crane"": positions: 0:C, 1:R, 2:A, 3:N, 4:E. Then E was index4? And now in ""TIRED"", E is index3? Great.\n\nAlso, includes new letters: T, I, D.\n\nTherefore, I think ""TIRED"" is a solid second guess.\n\nSo my guess: TIRED\n\nWe\'ll submit it.\n\n<guess>tired</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N are not in the secret word (marked as \'x\').\n- R and E are in the secret word, but not at positions 1 and 4 (in ""crane"", R was at position 1 and marked \'-\', E was at position 4 and marked \'-\').\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include R and E since they are in the secret word.\n- R cannot be at position 1 again (to avoid repeating a known wrong position).\n- E cannot be at position 4 again (to avoid repeating a known wrong position).\n- Avoid using C, A, or N.\n- Aim for new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) to maximize information.\n\nThe word ""tired"" works well:\n- Positions: T at 0 (new position/letter), I at 1 (new letter), R at 2 (new position for R), E at 3 (new position for E, avoiding position 4), D at 4 (new letter).\n- Avoids C, A, N.\n- Tests R in position 2 and E in position 3, while introducing new letters T, I, D.\n\nThis guess helps narrow down positions for R and E and provides information on other letters.\n\n<guess>tired</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C: not in word (x)\n- R: in word but wrong position (-)\n- A: not in word (x)\n- N: not in word (x)\n- E: in word but wrong position (-)\n\nSecond guess: ""tired""\n- T: not in word (x)\n- I: correct position (✓) at index 1 (second letter)\n- R: in word but wrong position (-) - note: in ""tired"", R is at index 2\n- E: correct position (✓) at index 3 (fourth letter)\n- D: not in word (x)\n\nWhat we know so far:\n1. The secret word has I as the second letter (index 1) and E as the fourth letter (index 3). So the word pattern is: _ I _ E _\n2. The word contains R, but not at the positions we\'ve tried: \n   - In ""crane"", R was at index 1 (second position) and was wrong -> so R is not at index 1.\n   - In ""tired"", R was at index 2 (third position) and was wrong -> so R is not at index 2.\n   Therefore, R must be at index 0, 3, or 4? But wait, index 3 is already taken by E? So R cannot be at index 3? Because index 3 is E? So R must be at index 0 or 4? But index 4 is the last letter? And we haven\'t tried R at index 0 or 4.\n\n   However, note: in the pattern _ I _ E _, the positions are:\n   index0: unknown\n   index1: I (fixed)\n   index2: unknown\n   index3: E (fixed)\n   index4: unknown\n\n   So R must be in one of the unknown positions: index0, index2, or index4? But we have tried R at index2 (in ""tired"") and it was wrong? So R is not at index2. Therefore, R must be at index0 or index4.\n\n3. The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, D (from the x\'s).\n\n4. We also know that E is at index3, so we don\'t need to test that again? But we have it fixed.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that fits the pattern: _ I _ E _\n\nAnd we know the letters that are not in the word: C, A, N, T, D.\n\nAlso, we must include R? Because we know R is in the word? But we haven\'t placed it yet? So we have to include R in one of the unknown positions: index0, index2, or index4? But index2 is already tried? So only index0 or index4? But note: we have two unknowns: index0 and index4? And index2 is also unknown? But we tried R at index2 and it was wrong? So R is not at index2? Therefore, R must be at index0 or index4.\n\nBut wait, the pattern has three unknown positions: index0, index2, index4? But we know R must be in one of them? And we have two positions left? Actually, we have three positions? But R can only be in one? So the other two positions are for other letters.\n\nBut we also know that the word has exactly 5 letters? And we have fixed I and E? So the other three are unknown? But we know one of them must be R? And the other two are new letters? But we have to avoid C, A, N, T, D.\n\nSo the word pattern: [R?] I [some letter] E [R?]\n\nBut R can only be at one position? So either:\n- If R is at index0: then the word is R I ? E ?\n- If R is at index4: then the word is ? I ? E R\n\nBut we don\'t know which? So we need to test.\n\nAlso, the middle letter at index2 is unknown? And must be a letter that we haven\'t tried? And not in the exclusion list.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we want to maximize information? But we have two possibilities? So we can try to cover both? Or we can try a word that has R at index0? Or at index4? And also test new letters.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries? So we need to be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R at index0? And then if it\'s not, then R must be at index4? But we can do that in two steps? But we can also try to cover more letters.\n\nLet me think of words that fit the pattern and include R? And avoid the bad letters.\n\nFirst, if R is at index0: then the word starts with ""RI"" and then any letter (not C,A,N,T,D) and then ""E"" and then any letter (not C,A,N,T,D). But the last letter could be R? But if R is at index0, then it cannot be at index4? Because we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s? But the feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicates? So it could have two R\'s? But we don\'t know? So we must consider.\n\nBut in our case, we know R is in the word? But we don\'t know if it appears twice? So we have to be cautious.\n\nSimilarly, if R is at index4, then the word ends with ""R"", and the first letter is not R? But again, could be two R\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo simplify, let\'s assume no duplicates for now? But we can\'t assume? So we have to consider.\n\nBut to maximize information, we can try a word that has R at index0? And then new letters? And see.\n\nBut we also have to fill the pattern.\n\nList of possible words? But we don\'t have the dictionary? So we have to think of common words.\n\nCommon words with pattern _ I _ E _ and avoiding C,A,N,T,D.\n\nAvailable letters: we can use B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common ones.\n\nWe also know that R must be at index0 or index4? So we can try one of the cases.\n\nBut we can also try a word that doesn\'t have R? But we know R is in the word? So we must include it? Because if we don\'t, we might not get information about its position? But we already know it\'s in the word? So we can skip including it? But then we don\'t know where it is? So better to include it? Since we have to find the position.\n\nSo let\'s try to form a word with R at index0? And then we can test that.\n\nFor example: ""RIPER""? But has two R\'s? And E at index3? But we have E fixed? And the pattern is R I ? E R? Then index4 is R? But we don\'t know if R is at index4? And also, we have to avoid D? But ""RIPER"" has R at 0 and 4? And P at 2? But is it valid? ""RIPER"" is a word? Meaning one who ripes? Or is it ""ripper""? No, ""riper"" is a word? But let\'s see: R I P E R? That\'s 5 letters? But we have two R\'s? And we don\'t know if the secret word has two R\'s? But we can try? But we also have to avoid T? T is not in ""RIPER""? But we have to avoid D? D is not in? But we have to avoid C,A,N,T,D? So ""RIPER"" has none of these? But we have two R\'s? And we know R is in the word? But we don\'t know if it\'s duplicated? So it\'s possible? But let\'s see the feedback? We might get confused? Because if the secret word has only one R? Then the R at index4 might be marked as not in word? Or if it\'s in the word but wrong position? But we have R at index0? Which we are testing? And if the secret word has R at index0? Then it would be marked correct? But if the secret word has R at index4? Then the R at index0 might be marked as wrong? And R at index4? But we don\'t have R at index4 in the guess? Wait, in ""RIPER"", we have R at index0 and index4? So if the secret word has R at index0? Then the first R is correct? And the last R? If the secret word has only one R? Then the last R would be marked as not in word? Or if it has two? Then both might be marked? But we don\'t know? So it might be messy? But we can try? However, we have limited guesses? So better to avoid duplicates? To keep it simple? So let\'s avoid using R twice? Unless necessary? But we can try a word with R only once? And at a new position? Which is either index0 or index4? And then the other positions with new letters.\n\nSo for example, if we put R at index0: then the word is R I ? E ? \n\nThe third letter (index2) must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,D}? And the last letter (index4) must be a letter not in {C,A,N,T,D}? And we want to use common letters? To maximize chance of hitting.\n\nSimilarly, if we put R at index4: then the word is ? I ? E R? And the first and third letters are new.\n\nBut we don\'t know which? So we can choose one? Or we can choose a word that tests both possibilities? But that might be hard? Because we have to have R at one of them? But we can only put R at one position? So we have to choose.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R at index0? And then if it\'s not? Then next time we put at index4? But we have 4 guesses left? So we can do that.\n\nBut we can also try to cover more letters? So let\'s try R at index0? And then use two new common letters? For index2 and index4.\n\nFor example: ""RIPEN""? But N is not allowed? Because we know N is not in the word? From first guess? So avoid N.\n\n""RIPED""? But D is not allowed? And also, ""riped"" is not a word? It\'s ""ripened"" without n? Not valid.\n\n""RICES""? But C and S? C is not allowed? And also, we avoid C.\n\n""RIFLE""? R I F L E? Then pattern: R I F L E? But we have E at index4? But in the pattern, we have E fixed at index3? But in ""RIFLE"", E is at index4? But we need E at index3? So that doesn\'t match? Because we know E must be at index3? So the word must have E at index3? So the fourth letter must be E? So we cannot change that? So in our guess, we must have the second letter I and the fourth letter E? So the pattern is fixed: _ I _ E _\n\nTherefore, for ""RIFLE"": it would be R I F L E? Then the fourth letter is L? Not E? So that doesn\'t work? Because we must have E at index3? So the word must be of the form ? I ? E ?\n\nSo we cannot use ""RIFLE"" because it has E at the end? Not at index3.\n\nSo we must have the fourth letter as E? So the word must end with E? No? The fourth letter is E? But the fifth letter is still unknown? So the word is ... E at the fourth position? And then a fifth letter? So it\'s not necessarily ending with E? For example, ""RIPEN"" has E at index3? And then N at index4? But we know N is not in the word? So we cannot use that.\n\nSo let\'s think of words that fit: ? I ? E ?\n\nWith R at index0: so ""R I ? E ?""\n\nCommon words: \n- ""RIPER"": but has two R\'s? And E at index3? Then last letter R? So ""R I P E R""? But we don\'t know if R is duplicated? And we avoid duplicates? So skip? \n- ""RIPES"": R I P E S? Then S at index4? And P at index2? Avoids C,A,N,T,D? So S is new? P is new? So we can try? But is ""RIPES"" a word? Yes, as in ""ripens"" but for fruit? Or third person? But it\'s a valid word? \n- ""RICES"": but C is not allowed? \n- ""RIDES"": but D is not allowed? \n- ""RIFLE"": doesn\'t fit because E must be at index3? But in ""RIFLE"", index3 is L? So no? \n- ""RINSE"": but N is not allowed? \n- ""RIPED"": not a word? \n- ""RIVER"": R I V E R? Then V at index2? And R at index0 and index4? Duplicate R? And we avoid? But let\'s see? \n- ""RISER"": R I S E R? Then S at index2? And R at index0 and index4? Again duplicate? \n\nBut we can try without duplicate? So ""RIPES"": R I P E S? Then P at index2? S at index4? And no duplicate? And letters: R, I, P, E, S? Avoids C,A,N,T,D? So we can try? \n\nBut we know that in the secret word, R might be at index0? Or index4? So if we put R at index0? And the secret word has R at index0? Then it would be marked correct? If not? Then it might be marked as wrong? Or if the secret word has R at index4? Then the R at index0 would be marked as wrong? Because it\'s in the word but wrong position? But we have S at index4? So if the secret word has R at index4? Then S at index4 would be marked as not in word? Or if the secret word has R at index0? Then S at index4 might be marked as not in word? Or if it is? \n\nBut we are testing: if we get R at index0 correct? Then we know R is at index0? And then we only have to find the letter at index2 and index4? But we have S at index4? So we get feedback on S? \n\nSimilarly, if R at index0 is marked as wrong? Then we know R must be at index4? Because we have only two possibilities? And then we can use that in the next guess? \n\nSo ""RIPES"" seems a good candidate? \n\nBut what about the letter at index2? We are testing P? \n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has R at index4? For example: ? I ? E R? \n\nThen the first letter and the third letter are new? \n\nFor example: ""WISER"": W I S E R? Then W at index0? S at index2? R at index4? And no duplicates? Avoids C,A,N,T,D? \n\nBut we know that in the secret word, E is at index3? So ""WISER"" has E at index3? And R at index4? So pattern: W I S E R? \n\nThen we test: if R is at index4? If it is? Then we get it correct? If not? Then we know R must be at index0? \n\nBut we have two options? So which one to choose? \n\nWe can choose either? But let\'s see which one covers more common letters? \n\nIn ""RIPES"": letters R, I, P, E, S? We already know I and E? So we are testing R, P, S? But R we are testing at index0? P at index2? S at index4? \n\nIn ""WISER"": W, I, S, E, R? Testing W, S, R? With R at index4? \n\nBoth are valid? But ""RIPES"" has P and S? ""WISER"" has W and S? P is more common than W? So ""RIPES"" might be better? \n\nBut we also have to consider that if we put R at index0? And it is correct? Then we have the first letter? And then we only have to find index2 and index4? But we have P and S? \n\nSimilarly, if we put R at index4? And it is correct? Then we have the last letter? And then we have to find index0 and index2? \n\nBut we have to choose one? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t have R? But then we don\'t test R? But we know R is in the word? So we should test? \n\nBut we can also choose a word that has R at index0? And also tests other common letters? \n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has the letter at index2? And then we can get information about that? And also, we can set R at one of the ends? \n\nBut I think ""RIPES"" is fine? \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from the second guess: we have I at index1 correct? And E at index3 correct? So we have two fixed? And we know R is in the word? But not at index2? So we are testing index0 and index4? \n\nSo in ""RIPES"", we are putting R at index0? And S at index4? And P at index2? \n\nIf the secret word has R at index0? Then the first letter R would be marked correct? And then we know the word is R I ? E ? \n\nThen we have to find the letter at index2 and index4? We have P at index2? If P is in the word? Then we get feedback? Similarly for S? \n\nIf the secret word does not have R at index0? Then the R at index0 would be marked as wrong? But we know R is in the word? So it must be at index4? Then we know the word is ? I ? E R? \n\nAnd then we have P at index2? And S at index4? But if R is at index4? Then S at index4 would be marked as not in word? Because the secret word has R at index4? So S is not in the word? Or if S is in the word? But at another position? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut we get feedback? \n\nSo it\'s acceptable? \n\nBut to avoid confusion? We can choose a word that has R at index0? And then the other positions with letters that are not likely to be at the ends? But I think it\'s fine? \n\nAnother word: ""RIPEN"" is not allowed? Because N is bad? \n\n""RICES"" not allowed? \n\n""RIDES"" not allowed? \n\n""RIFLE"" doesn\'t fit? \n\n""RISEN"": R I S E N? But N is bad? \n\n""RIPED"" not a word? \n\nSo ""RIPES"" or ""RIVER"" (but duplicate)? \n\nOr ""RISER"" (duplicate)? \n\nOr ""RIDER"" (duplicate and D is bad)? \n\nSo ""RIPES"" seems the best? \n\nBut let\'s consider ""WISER"": if we put R at index4? Then we test W at index0? S at index2? \n\nIf R is at index4? Then we get it correct? And then we know the word is ? I ? E R? And we have W at index0? S at index2? \n\nIf R is not at index4? Then we know it must be at index0? And then we have W at index0? Which would be marked as not in word? Or wrong? \n\nBut we get information? \n\nBut ""WISER"" has W? Which is less common? So ""RIPES"" with P and S? More common? \n\nBut we can also try ""PRIZE""? But Z is less common? \n\nOr ""BRINE""? But B is new? But N is bad? \n\nSo I think ""RIPES"" is a good choice? \n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid? \n\n""RIPES"" is a valid word? Meaning the third person singular of ""ripe""? Or as in fruit? But it\'s accepted? \n\nSo I\'ll go with ""RIPES"". \n\nBut let\'s see: in ""RIPES"", we have E at index3? Which is fixed? And I at index1? Fixed? So we are guessing: \n- R at index0? \n- P at index2? \n- S at index4? \n\nAnd we avoid C,A,N,T,D? \n\nSo feedback will tell us: \n- If R is at index0? \n- If P is in the word? And if so, where? \n- If S is in the word? And if so, where? \n\nAnd if R is not at index0? Then we know R must be at index4? \n\nSo we can proceed? \n\nTherefore, third guess: ""RIPES"" \n\nBut wait, what if the secret word has P at index2? Then we get it? Or if not? \n\nBut we have to try? \n\nSo <guess>ripes</guess> \n\nBut let me double-check the pattern: \nPosition 0: R \nPosition 1: I (fixed) \nPosition 2: P \nPosition 3: E (fixed) \nPosition 4: S \n\nYes. \n\nWe\'ll see the feedback.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(not in word), R(in word, wrong position), A(not in word), N(not in word), E(in word, wrong position).  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - R and E are in the secret word.  \n    - C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  \n    - R is not at position 1 (index 1), and E is not at position 4 (index 4).  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""tired""** → Feedback: T(not in word), I(correct position), R(in word, wrong position), E(correct position), D(not in word).  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - I is at position 1 (index 1) and E is at position 3 (index 3) in the secret word.  \n    - T and D are not in the secret word.  \n    - R is in the word but not at position 2 (index 2) (since it was marked as wrong position).  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word pattern is: `[?] I [?] E [?]` (positions: index 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).  \n- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  \n  - Position 1 (index 1) = `I`  \n  - Position 3 (index 3) = `E`  \n- **R must be in the word** but cannot be at:  \n  - Position 1 (from ""crane"" feedback)  \n  - Position 2 (from ""tired"" feedback)  \n  - Since position 3 is fixed as `E`, R must be at position 0 or 4.  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, T, D (cannot appear anywhere).  \n- **Goal for next guess**:  \n  - Test R at position 0 (index 0) to resolve its location (if R is not at position 0, it must be at position 4).  \n  - Introduce new common letters to test the remaining unknown positions (index 2 and index 4).  \n  - Avoid excluded letters and reuse known correct positions (I at index 1, E at index 3).  \n\n### Chosen Guess: ""RIPES""\n- **Word breakdown**:  \n  - Position 0: `R` (tests if R is at index 0)  \n  - Position 1: `I` (fixed, known correct)  \n  - Position 2: `P` (new letter, tests index 2)  \n  - Position 3: `E` (fixed, known correct)  \n  - Position 4: `S` (new letter, tests index 4)  \n- **Why ""RIPES""?**  \n  - Tests R at position 0: If correct, R is at index 0; if wrong, R must be at index 4.  \n  - Introduces common letters `P` and `S` to gather information on positions 2 and 4.  \n  - Avoids excluded letters (C, A, N, T, D).  \n  - Uses a valid 5-letter word with high-frequency letters.  \n- **Expected outcomes**:  \n  - If R is at position 0, feedback will confirm it (✓).  \n  - If R is not at position 0, feedback will show it as wrong position (-) or not in word (x), confirming R must be at position 4.  \n  - Feedback on `P` and `S` will reveal if they are in the word and their positions.  \n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down possibilities for R while testing new letters in the remaining unknown positions.\n\n<guess>ripes</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tired -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)\nGuess 3: ripes -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""ripes"":
- R(✓) at index0: correct! So R is at position 0.
- I(✓) at index1: correct (already known).
- P(x) at index2: P is not in the word.
- E(✓) at index3: correct (already known).
- S(-) at index4: S is in the word but in the wrong position.

Now, what we know:
- The secret word starts with R (index0), then I (index1), then an unknown letter (index2), then E (index3), and then an unknown letter (index4).
- Pattern: R I ? E ?
- We know S is in the word, but not at index4. Since the only unknown positions are index2 and index4, and S is not at index4, it must be at index2? But wait, index2 is the only other unknown? But we have two positions: index2 and index4? And S is in the word but not at index4? So it must be at index2? But we have P at index2 in the guess? And P was marked as not in the word? So if S is at index2? Then we have a conflict? Let me think.

Actually, the feedback for ""ripes"":
- R at index0: correct (so secret word has R at 0)
- I at index1: correct
- P at index2: not in the word (so P is not in the secret word at all)
- E at index3: correct
- S at index4: in the word but wrong position (so S is in the secret word, but not at index4)

Now, the secret word has S, but not at index4. The only positions are:
- index0: R (fixed)
- index1: I (fixed)
- index2: unknown, but we know P is not in the word? So the letter at index2 is not P? And also, since S is in the word and not at index4, it must be at index2? Because that's the only other position? But wait, what about the possibility of duplicate letters? We don't know if S appears twice? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far? But we must consider.

The secret word has positions:
0: R
1: I
2: ? (must be S? because S is in the word and not at index4, and index0 and index1 and index3 are fixed? So the only place left is index2? Or could there be another position? But there are only five positions? And index3 is E? So the unknown positions are index2 and index4? And S must be at one of them? But we know it's not at index4? So it must be at index2? Therefore, the secret word has S at index2? So the word is R I S E ?

But we have to confirm: the feedback says S is in the word but not at index4? And the only other unknown position is index2? So yes, S must be at index2? But in our guess, at index2 we had P? Which was marked as not in the word? So if S is at index2, then in the secret word, index2 is S? So we can deduce that.

But let me write the secret word so far: R I [S] E ? 

And the last letter is unknown? And we know that S is at index2? So the word is R I S E ?

Now, what about the last letter? We need to find the letter at index4.

We also know that the secret word does not contain: C, A, N, T, D, P (from previous feedback).

And we know that S is in the word? But we have placed it at index2? So the last letter is a new letter? And we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, D, P.

We also know that from the first guess, E was in the word but not at index4? But now we have E at index3? And we have fixed that? So that's consistent.

Now, for the last letter, we need a letter that is not in the excluded list? And it must be a valid English word.

The word is ""RISE?"" and we need a letter for the last position? But ""RISE"" is 4 letters? So we need a 5-letter word? The pattern is R I S E ? so the last letter is the fifth.

Common words: 
- RISEN? But N is excluded? Not allowed.
- RISER? But R is already at index0? And if we put R at index4? Then it would be duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates? But let's check: in the first guess, no duplicates? Second, no? Third, no? So maybe no duplicates? But we can't be sure? However, ""RISER"" has two R's? And we know R is at index0? So if we put R at index4? Then it would be a duplicate? But the feedback for the first guess: R was marked as in the word? But we don't know if it was the only R? Similarly, in the third guess, R at index0 was marked correct? But if the secret word has only one R? Then ""RISER"" would have an extra R? But we don't know.

But let's see: if the secret word is ""RISER"", then it has R at index0 and index4? But we have R at index0 correct? And then S at index2? But in our third guess, we had S at index4? And it was marked as wrong position? But if the secret word is ""RISER"", then S is at index2? And there is no S at index4? So in the third guess, we had S at index4? But the secret word has no S at index4? So it should be marked as not in the word? But the feedback says S is in the word but wrong position? So that means S is in the word? But not at index4? So if the secret word is ""RISER"", then S is at index2? And we have S at index4 in the guess? So the feedback for S should be that it is in the word but wrong position? Because S is present? But at index2? Not index4? So that matches? But then the secret word would be ""RISER""? But we have to check the feedback for the last letter? In the third guess, we had S at index4? But the secret word has R at index4? So we don't have a letter at index4 in the guess that matches? But we have S at index4? And the secret word has R at index4? So S is not at index4? But it is in the word? So marked as wrong position? And the R at index0 is correct? So the feedback for ""ripes"" for ""RISER"" would be:
- R: correct (index0)
- I: correct (index1)
- P: not in word? Because ""RISER"" has no P? So marked x? Which matches.
- E: correct (index3)
- S: in word but wrong position? Because S is at index2? Not index4? So marked -? Which matches.

So ""RISER"" is a candidate? But we have to check if it is allowed? We have excluded letters? But ""RISER"" has R, I, S, E, R? No excluded letters? C,A,N,T,D,P are not in it? So it is possible.

But we also have other candidates? For example, ""RISE"" with a different last letter? Like ""RISES""? But that has two S's? And we have S at index2? And if we put S at index4? But the feedback says S is not at index4? So if the secret word is ""RISES"", then S is at index2 and index4? Then in the guess ""ripes"", we have S at index4? And the secret word has S at index4? So it should be marked as correct? But the feedback says S is in the word but wrong position? So it cannot be at index4? Therefore, the secret word cannot have S at index4? So ""RISES"" would have S at index4? So it would be marked as correct? But we got a wrong position? So it cannot be ""RISES""? Similarly, any word with S at index4 is ruled out? Because we got S at index4 marked as wrong position? Meaning S is not at index4? So the secret word has S at index2? And the last letter is not S? And not P? And not the excluded letters.

So the secret word is R I S E ? 

And the last letter is a letter that is not C,A,N,T,D,P, and not S? Because if it were S, then S at index4 would be correct? But we got wrong position? So it cannot be S? And we know S is at index2? So the last letter is a different letter.

So what are possible words? 
- R I S E and then a letter? 
Common words: 
- RISEN? But N is excluded? 
- RISER? But R is at index0? And if we put R at index4? Then duplicate? But is it allowed? 
- RISE with a different letter? Like ""RISKY""? But K? And Y? But ""RISKY"" is R I S K Y? Then index3 is K? But we need index3 to be E? So no? 
The word must have E at index3? So it must be R I S E ? 

So the only common word I can think of is ""RISER"" or ""RISES""? But ""RISES"" is invalid because it would have S at index4? And we know S is not at index4? So ""RISES"" is impossible? 

What about ""RISHI""? But not common? And H? And I at index1 and index4? But we have I at index1? And the word is R I S H I? Then index3 is H? But we need E at index3? So no? 

""RIVET""? But V? And T is excluded? 

""RIPED"" not allowed? 

""RICES"" not allowed? 

""RINSE"" not allowed? 

""RIPEN"" not allowed? 

""RIPER""? But P is excluded? And also, in ""RIPER"", index3 is E? But index2 is P? Which is excluded? 

So the only common word that fits the pattern R I S E ? and avoids excluded letters is ""RISER""? 

But ""RISER"" has two R's? And we have R at index0? And if we put R at index4? Then it is a duplicate? 

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback so far hasn't indicated duplicates? But that doesn't mean there aren't any? 

In the first guess, we had no duplicates? Second, no? Third, no? But the secret word might have duplicates? 

Moreover, in the feedback for the third guess, we have S marked as wrong position? And if the secret word is ""RISER"", then it has only one S? At index2? So when we guessed S at index4? It was marked as wrong position? Which is correct? Because S is in the word but not at index4? 

And for R? We have R at index0 correct? And the R at index4 in the secret word? But in our guess, we didn't have a letter at index4 that is R? We had S? So we didn't test R at index4? 

So ""RISER"" is a valid candidate? 

But are there other words? 

What about ""RISE"" with a Y? Like ""RISEY""? Not a word? 

Or ""RISED""? But D is excluded? 

Or ""RISEL""? Not common? 

Or ""RISEE""? Not a word? 

So I think ""RISER"" is the only common word? 

But let's confirm the pattern: R I S E R? 

Positions:
0: R (correct)
1: I (correct)
2: S (we deduced it must be S? Because S is in the word and not at index4? And the only other position is index2? And we have no other unknown positions? So yes? 
3: E (correct)
4: R? 

But we don't know about the last letter? 

But we have to guess? 

Since we have only one candidate? We can guess ""RISER""? 

But we have 3 guesses left? So we can try? 

But let's see if there is another possibility? 

What if the secret word has S at index2? And the last letter is something else? But we need a valid word? 

For example, ""RISE"" is not 5 letters? 

""RISHI"" doesn't have E at index3? 

""RASER""? But A is excluded? 

""ROSE"" is 4 letters? 

""RUSES""? But U? And S at index4? But we know S is not at index4? 

""RASSE""? Not common? 

I think ""RISER"" is the only common word? 

So I'll go with ""RISER"". 

But we have to make sure? 

Another word: ""RIPES"" was our guess? And we got feedback? 

If the secret word is ""RISER"", then the feedback for ""ripes"" is:
- R: correct (index0)
- I: correct (index1)
- P: not in word? Because ""RISER"" has no P? So x? 
- E: correct (index3)
- S: in word but wrong position? Because in ""RISER"", S is at index2? Not index4? So -? 

Which matches the feedback? 

And the secret word ""RISER"" has R at index0, I at index1, S at index2, E at index3, R at index4? 

And it avoids C,A,N,T,D,P? 

So it is a valid candidate? 

Therefore, we guess ""RISER"". 

But note: we have not tested the last letter? But we have to guess the word? 

So <guess>riser</guess> 

But let me see if there is another candidate? 

What about ""RICES""? Not allowed? 

Or ""RINSE""? Not allowed? 

""RIPEN""? Not allowed? 

""RIVER""? But V? And E at index3? ""RIVER"" is R I V E R? Then index3 is E? So it fits? And V is not excluded? And R at index0 and index4? 

But we have excluded letters: C,A,N,T,D,P? V is not excluded? So ""RIVER"" is also a candidate? 

But in ""RIVER"", the letter at index2 is V? And we have S? But in the feedback, we have S marked as in the word? But if the secret word is ""RIVER"", then it has no S? So the feedback for S should be not in the word? But we got S marked as in the word? So that's a contradiction? 

Therefore, ""RIVER"" cannot be? Because it doesn't have S? But we know S is in the word? 

Similarly, any candidate must have S? Because we got S(-) in the feedback? 

So ""RIVER"" has no S? So it is invalid? 

Similarly, ""RISER"" has S at index2? So it has S? 

Therefore, the only candidate is ""RISER""? 

So we guess that.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: `C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)`  
  - `C`, `A`, `N` are **not** in the secret word.  
  - `R` and `E` are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (not at index 1 or 4, respectively).  

- **Guess 2: ""tired""** → Feedback: `T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)`  
  - `T` and `D` are **not** in the secret word.  
  - `I` is **correct** at index 1.  
  - `E` is **correct** at index 3.  
  - `R` is in the word but **not** at index 2.  

- **Guess 3: ""ripes""** → Feedback: `R(✓) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-)`  
  - `R` is **correct** at index 0.  
  - `I` is **correct** at index 1 (confirmed).  
  - `P` is **not** in the secret word.  
  - `E` is **correct** at index 3 (confirmed).  
  - `S` is in the word but **not** at index 4.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `R I ? E ?`  
   - Positions:  
     - Index 0: `R` (fixed).  
     - Index 1: `I` (fixed).  
     - Index 2: Unknown (must be `S`; see below).  
     - Index 3: `E` (fixed).  
     - Index 4: Unknown.  
2. **Confirmed letters in the word**:  
   - `R`, `I`, `E`, and `S` are in the secret word.  
3. **Excluded letters**: `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `D`, `P` (cannot appear anywhere).  
4. **Critical insight for `S`**:  
   - `S` is in the word but not at index 4 (from Guess 3 feedback).  
   - The only unknown positions are index 2 and index 4.  
   - Since `S` cannot be at index 4, it **must be at index 2**.  
   - Thus, the secret word is `R I S E ?`.  
5. **Deduction for index 4 (last letter)**:  
   - The last letter must be a valid English letter not in the excluded list (`C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `D`, `P`).  
   - It cannot be `S` (since `S` is at index 2, and duplicates are unlikely based on feedback).  
   - Common options: `R`, `L`, `M`, `B`, `G`, etc.  
   - **Only valid word**: `RISER` (fits the pattern `R I S E R` and avoids excluded letters).  
     - Why `RISER`?  
       - `R` at index 4 is allowed (no feedback rules against duplicates).  
       - All letters are valid (no conflicts with exclusions).  
       - It is a common English word (meaning ""one who rises"" or a structural component).  

### Next Guess: ""RISER""
- **Reasoning**:  
  - The pattern `R I S E ?` must be resolved, and `RISER` is the only common word that fits all constraints.  
  - If correct, the game is won. If incorrect, it will reveal the true last letter (though no other valid words exist).  
- **Expected feedback if correct**: All letters marked `✓`.  

<guess>riser</guess>",riser,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""ripes"":
- R(✓) at index0: correct! So R is at position 0.
- I(✓) at index1: correct (already known).
- P(x) at index2: P is not in the word.
- E(✓) at index3: correct (already known).
- S(-) at index4: S is in the word but in the wrong position.

Now, what we know:
- The secret word starts with R (index0), then I (index1), then an unknown letter (index2), then E (index3), and then an unknown letter (index4).
- Pattern: R I ? E ?
- We know S is in the word, but not at index4. Since the only unknown positions are index2 and index4, and S is not at index4, it must be at index2? But wait, index2 is the only other unknown? But we have two positions: index2 and index4? And S is in the word but not at index4? So it must be at index2? But we have P at index2 in the guess? And P was marked as not in the word? So if S is at index2? Then we have a conflict? Let me think.

Actually, the feedback for ""ripes"":
- R at index0: correct (so secret word has R at 0)
- I at index1: correct
- P at index2: not in the word (so P is not in the secret word at all)
- E at index3: correct
- S at index4: in the word but wrong position (so S is in the secret word, but not at index4)

Now, the secret word has S, but not at index4. The only positions are:
- index0: R (fixed)
- index1: I (fixed)
- index2: unknown, but we know P is not in the word? So the letter at index2 is not P? And also, since S is in the word and not at index4, it must be at index2? Because that's the only other position? But wait, what about the possibility of duplicate letters? We don't know if S appears twice? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far? But we must consider.

The secret word has positions:
0: R
1: I
2: ? (must be S? because S is in the word and not at index4, and index0 and index1 and index3 are fixed? So the only place left is index2? Or could there be another position? But there are only five positions? And index3 is E? So the unknown positions are index2 and index4? And S must be at one of them? But we know it's not at index4? So it must be at index2? Therefore, the secret word has S at index2? So the word is R I S E ?

But we have to confirm: the feedback says S is in the word but not at index4? And the only other unknown position is index2? So yes, S must be at index2? But in our guess, at index2 we had P? Which was marked as not in the word? So if S is at index2, then in the secret word, index2 is S? So we can deduce that.

But let me write the secret word so far: R I [S] E ? 

And the last letter is unknown? And we know that S is at index2? So the word is R I S E ?

Now, what about the last letter? We need to find the letter at index4.

We also know that the secret word does not contain: C, A, N, T, D, P (from previous feedback).

And we know that S is in the word? But we have placed it at index2? So the last letter is a new letter? And we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, D, P.

We also know that from the first guess, E was in the word but not at index4? But now we have E at index3? And we have fixed that? So that's consistent.

Now, for the last letter, we need a letter that is not in the excluded list? And it must be a valid English word.

The word is ""RISE?"" and we need a letter for the last position? But ""RISE"" is 4 letters? So we need a 5-letter word? The pattern is R I S E ? so the last letter is the fifth.

Common words: 
- RISEN? But N is excluded? Not allowed.
- RISER? But R is already at index0? And if we put R at index4? Then it would be duplicate? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But in the feedback, we haven't seen duplicates? But let's check: in the first guess, no duplicates? Second, no? Third, no? So maybe no duplicates? But we can't be sure? However, ""RISER"" has two R's? And we know R is at index0? So if we put R at index4? Then it would be a duplicate? But the feedback for the first guess: R was marked as in the word? But we don't know if it was the only R? Similarly, in the third guess, R at index0 was marked correct? But if the secret word has only one R? Then ""RISER"" would have an extra R? But we don't know.

But let's see: if the secret word is ""RISER"", then it has R at index0 and index4? But we have R at index0 correct? And then S at index2? But in our third guess, we had S at index4? And it was marked as wrong position? But if the secret word is ""RISER"", then S is at index2? And there is no S at index4? So in the third guess, we had S at index4? But the secret word has no S at index4? So it should be marked as not in the word? But the feedback says S is in the word but wrong position? So that means S is in the word? But not at index4? So if the secret word is ""RISER"", then S is at index2? And we have S at index4 in the guess? So the feedback for S should be that it is in the word but wrong position? Because S is present? But at index2? Not index4? So that matches? But then the secret word would be ""RISER""? But we have to check the feedback for the last letter? In the third guess, we had S at index4? But the secret word has R at index4? So we don't have a letter at index4 in the guess that matches? But we have S at index4? And the secret word has R at index4? So S is not at index4? But it is in the word? So marked as wrong position? And the R at index0 is correct? So the feedback for ""ripes"" for ""RISER"" would be:
- R: correct (index0)
- I: correct (index1)
- P: not in word? Because ""RISER"" has no P? So marked x? Which matches.
- E: correct (index3)
- S: in word but wrong position? Because S is at index2? Not index4? So marked -? Which matches.

So ""RISER"" is a candidate? But we have to check if it is allowed? We have excluded letters? But ""RISER"" has R, I, S, E, R? No excluded letters? C,A,N,T,D,P are not in it? So it is possible.

But we also have other candidates? For example, ""RISE"" with a different last letter? Like ""RISES""? But that has two S's? And we have S at index2? And if we put S at index4? But the feedback says S is not at index4? So if the secret word is ""RISES"", then S is at index2 and index4? Then in the guess ""ripes"", we have S at index4? And the secret word has S at index4? So it should be marked as correct? But the feedback says S is in the word but wrong position? So it cannot be at index4? Therefore, the secret word cannot have S at index4? So ""RISES"" would have S at index4? So it would be marked as correct? But we got a wrong position? So it cannot be ""RISES""? Similarly, any word with S at index4 is ruled out? Because we got S at index4 marked as wrong position? Meaning S is not at index4? So the secret word has S at index2? And the last letter is not S? And not P? And not the excluded letters.

So the secret word is R I S E ? 

And the last letter is a letter that is not C,A,N,T,D,P, and not S? Because if it were S, then S at index4 would be correct? But we got wrong position? So it cannot be S? And we know S is at index2? So the last letter is a different letter.

So what are possible words? 
- R I S E and then a letter? 
Common words: 
- RISEN? But N is excluded? 
- RISER? But R is at index0? And if we put R at index4? Then duplicate? But is it allowed? 
- RISE with a different letter? Like ""RISKY""? But K? And Y? But ""RISKY"" is R I S K Y? Then index3 is K? But we need index3 to be E? So no? 
The word must have E at index3? So it must be R I S E ? 

So the only common word I can think of is ""RISER"" or ""RISES""? But ""RISES"" is invalid because it would have S at index4? And we know S is not at index4? So ""RISES"" is impossible? 

What about ""RISHI""? But not common? And H? And I at index1 and index4? But we have I at index1? And the word is R I S H I? Then index3 is H? But we need E at index3? So no? 

""RIVET""? But V? And T is excluded? 

""RIPED"" not allowed? 

""RICES"" not allowed? 

""RINSE"" not allowed? 

""RIPEN"" not allowed? 

""RIPER""? But P is excluded? And also, in ""RIPER"", index3 is E? But index2 is P? Which is excluded? 

So the only common word that fits the pattern R I S E ? and avoids excluded letters is ""RISER""? 

But ""RISER"" has two R's? And we have R at index0? And if we put R at index4? Then it is a duplicate? 

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback so far hasn't indicated duplicates? But that doesn't mean there aren't any? 

In the first guess, we had no duplicates? Second, no? Third, no? But the secret word might have duplicates? 

Moreover, in the feedback for the third guess, we have S marked as wrong position? And if the secret word is ""RISER"", then it has only one S? At index2? So when we guessed S at index4? It was marked as wrong position? Which is correct? Because S is in the word but not at index4? 

And for R? We have R at index0 correct? And the R at index4 in the secret word? But in our guess, we didn't have a letter at index4 that is R? We had S? So we didn't test R at index4? 

So ""RISER"" is a valid candidate? 

But are there other words? 

What about ""RISE"" with a Y? Like ""RISEY""? Not a word? 

Or ""RISED""? But D is excluded? 

Or ""RISEL""? Not common? 

Or ""RISEE""? Not a word? 

So I think ""RISER"" is the only common word? 

But let's confirm the pattern: R I S E R? 

Positions:
0: R (correct)
1: I (correct)
2: S (we deduced it must be S? Because S is in the word and not at index4? And the only other position is index2? And we have no other unknown positions? So yes? 
3: E (correct)
4: R? 

But we don't know about the last letter? 

But we have to guess? 

Since we have only one candidate? We can guess ""RISER""? 

But we have 3 guesses left? So we can try? 

But let's see if there is another possibility? 

What if the secret word has S at index2? And the last letter is something else? But we need a valid word? 

For example, ""RISE"" is not 5 letters? 

""RISHI"" doesn't have E at index3? 

""RASER""? But A is excluded? 

""ROSE"" is 4 letters? 

""RUSES""? But U? And S at index4? But we know S is not at index4? 

""RASSE""? Not common? 

I think ""RISER"" is the only common word? 

So I'll go with ""RISER"". 

But we have to make sure? 

Another word: ""RIPES"" was our guess? And we got feedback? 

If the secret word is ""RISER"", then the feedback for ""ripes"" is:
- R: correct (index0)
- I: correct (index1)
- P: not in word? Because ""RISER"" has no P? So x? 
- E: correct (index3)
- S: in word but wrong position? Because in ""RISER"", S is at index2? Not index4? So -? 

Which matches the feedback? 

And the secret word ""RISER"" has R at index0, I at index1, S at index2, E at index3, R at index4? 

And it avoids C,A,N,T,D,P? 

So it is a valid candidate? 

Therefore, we guess ""RISER"". 

But note: we have not tested the last letter? But we have to guess the word? 

So <guess>riser</guess> 

But let me see if there is another candidate? 

What about ""RICES""? Not allowed? 

Or ""RINSE""? Not allowed? 

""RIPEN""? Not allowed? 

""RIVER""? But V? And E at index3? ""RIVER"" is R I V E R? Then index3 is E? So it fits? And V is not excluded? And R at index0 and index4? 

But we have excluded letters: C,A,N,T,D,P? V is not excluded? So ""RIVER"" is also a candidate? 

But in ""RIVER"", the letter at index2 is V? And we have S? But in the feedback, we have S marked as in the word? But if the secret word is ""RIVER"", then it has no S? So the feedback for S should be not in the word? But we got S marked as in the word? So that's a contradiction? 

Therefore, ""RIVER"" cannot be? Because it doesn't have S? But we know S is in the word? 

Similarly, any candidate must have S? Because we got S(-) in the feedback? 

So ""RIVER"" has no S? So it is invalid? 

Similarly, ""RISER"" has S at index2? So it has S? 

Therefore, the only candidate is ""RISER""? 

So we guess that.

  - `C`, `A`, `N` are **not** in the secret word.  
  - `R` and `E` are in the secret word but in the wrong positions (not at index 1 or 4, respectively).  

- **Guess 2: ""tired""** → Feedback: `T(x) I(✓) R(-) E(✓) D(x)`  
  - `T` and `D` are **not** in the secret word.  
  - `I` is **correct** at index 1.  
  - `E` is **correct** at index 3.  
  - `R` is in the word but **not** at index 2.  

- **Guess 3: ""ripes""** → Feedback: `R(✓) I(✓) P(x) E(✓) S(-)`  
  - `R` is **correct** at index 0.  
  - `I` is **correct** at index 1 (confirmed).  
  - `P` is **not** in the secret word.  
  - `E` is **correct** at index 3 (confirmed).  
  - `S` is in the word but **not** at index 4.  

### Key Deductions:
1. **Secret word pattern**: `R I ? E ?`  
   - Positions:  
     - Index 0: `R` (fixed).  
     - Index 1: `I` (fixed).  
     - Index 2: Unknown (must be `S`; see below).  
     - Index 3: `E` (fixed).  
     - Index 4: Unknown.  
2. **Confirmed letters in the word**:  
   - `R`, `I`, `E`, and `S` are in the secret word.  
3. **Excluded letters**: `C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `D`, `P` (cannot appear anywhere).  
4. **Critical insight for `S`**:  
   - `S` is in the word but not at index 4 (from Guess 3 feedback).  
   - The only unknown positions are index 2 and index 4.  
   - Since `S` cannot be at index 4, it **must be at index 2**.  
   - Thus, the secret word is `R I S E ?`.  
5. **Deduction for index 4 (last letter)**:  
   - The last letter must be a valid English letter not in the excluded list (`C`, `A`, `N`, `T`, `D`, `P`).  
   - It cannot be `S` (since `S` is at index 2, and duplicates are unlikely based on feedback).  
   - Common options: `R`, `L`, `M`, `B`, `G`, etc.  
   - **Only valid word**: `RISER` (fits the pattern `R I S E R` and avoids excluded letters).  
     - Why `RISER`?  
       - `R` at index 4 is allowed (no feedback rules against duplicates).  
       - All letters are valid (no conflicts with exclusions).  
       - It is a common English word (meaning ""one who rises"" or a structural component).  

### Next Guess: ""RISER""
- **Reasoning**:  
  - The pattern `R I S E ?` must be resolved, and `RISER` is the only common word that fits all constraints.  
  - If correct, the game is won. If incorrect, it will reveal the true last letter (though no other valid words exist).  
- **Expected feedback if correct**: All letters marked `✓`.",Guess 4: riser -> FEEDBACK: R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
