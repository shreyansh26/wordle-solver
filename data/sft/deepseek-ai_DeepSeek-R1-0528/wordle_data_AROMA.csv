 Common letters in English 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.
 A good starting word is one that has common letters and no duplicates to cover more ground.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.
 Another is ""SLATE"". Let's choose ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

Alright, I need to process the feedback from the first guess to come up with a better second guess. So the first guess was ""crane"" and the feedback was:

- C: ❌ (not in the word)
- R: ✅ (correct letter and position)
- A: ➖ (in the word but wrong position)
- N: ❌ (not in the word)
- E: ❌ (not in the word)

Breaking this down:
- The letter R is confirmed to be in the second position (since it's ✅).
- The letter A is somewhere in the word but not in the third position.
- C, N, and E are completely absent.

My next guess needs to:
- Keep R in the second position since it's correct.
- Include A, but not in the third position.
- Avoid using C, N, or E again.
- Aim to test other common letters to gather more information.

Considering potential words:
Starting with R fixed in the second position (so the word is _ R _ _ _):

Possible letters for other positions:
- First position: Try vowels like A, I, O, U? Or common consonants excluding C, N, E.
- Third position: Not A (since A is in the word but not here). Could test B, D, F, G, H, etc.
- Fourth and fifth positions: Wide open, but need common letters.

Words that come to mind:
- ""Brain"": B R A I N – but N is excluded, so invalid.
- ""Brain"" has N – ❌
- ""Brave"": B R A V E – but E is excluded.
- ""Drake"": D R A K E – E excluded.
- Need to avoid E and N.

Better option: ""Trait""? T R A I T – contains A not in third place? Wait, A is in position 3 again? Feedback said A is not in position 3. So ""Trait"" places A in third position – invalid for this clue.

Another option: ""Party""? P A R T Y – but R is in third position? Wait, I need R in second position. ""Party"" is P-A-R-T-Y, so R is third. Wrong. Must keep R at position 2.

Think of structure: _ R A _ _ – but A can’t be third. Position 3 can't be A, but A must be elsewhere.

A is in the word but not third. Possibilities: first, fourth, or fifth.

So:
- Case 1: A is first → A R _ _ _
- Case 2: A is fourth → _ R _ A _
- Case 3: A is fifth → _ R _ _ A

I need a word that fits one of these, uses common letters, and avoids C,N,E.

Let's brainstorm:

For case 1: A first → A R _ _ _
Possible words: ""Arbor"", ""Arson"", ""Argue"", ""Array"" – but ""Arbor"" has O? Not bad. Also ""Armor"".  

For case 2: A fourth → _ R _ A _
Like ""Graze""? G R ? A E – E excluded. ""Drama""? D R A M A – A is in third position? ""Drama"" is D-R-A-M-A – so positions: D(1), R(2), A(3). But A should not be in position 3! So invalid.

Avoid words with A in pos 3.

For case 4 position: _ R _ A _
Like ""Orbit""? O R B I T – no A? Doesn’t include A.

Word containing A in fourth: ""Trap"" is 4 letters, too short. Need 5 letters. ""Frail""? F R A I L – A in pos 3 again. No.

""Broil""? B R O I L – no A.  

Need to include A somewhere not third.

Try: _ R _ _ A → fifth position  
Words: ""Opera"" is O-P-E-R-A – R is fourth, not second. No, structure must have R second.

So consistent pattern: Position 1,2,3,4,5:  
- Pos 1: ?  
- Pos 2: R  
- Pos 3: not A  
- Pos 4: could be A  
- Pos 5: could be A  

If A is fourth: _ R X A Y  
If A is fifth: _ R X Y A  

Now find words with R second, A in either fourth or fifth, no C,N,E.

Options for fourth position A:  
- ""Gravy""? G R A V Y – A is third? G(1), R(2), A(3) – forbidden.  

A in fourth: Position 3 must not be A. So word like:  
- ""? R ? A ?""  

Example: ""Orcas""? O R C A S – C excluded? C is unused but feedback said C is out, so avoid C.  
Also, no C,N,E.  

Another: ""Frail"" not good. ""Trail""? T R A I L – A third, no.  

""Brand""? B R A N D – N excluded? Feedback says N ❌.  

Avoid N.

""Broad""? B R O A D – A is fourth? Positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). Yes, A is fourth.  
Letters: B, R, O, A, D  
Avoid C,N,E? O is new, D new. All allowed?  

But O wasn't tested yet. Same for D.

Another choice: ""Grail""? G R A I L – A in third, no.

""March""? M A R C H – R is third? No structure issue.

Keep focus: R in second.

Another word: ""Frost""? F R O S T – but no A? Need to include A since it's in the word.

Important: I must include A in the guess because it's confirmed in the word, just not position 3.

So my guess should contain A somewhere else.

Back to ""Broad"": B R O A D  
- B (new)  
- R fixed in pos 2  
- O new  
- A in pos 4 (not 3, good)  
- D new  

Another word: ""Broth""? B R O T H – no A.

""Bravo""? B R A V O – A in pos 3. Forbidden.

""Crawl""? C excluded.

Use letter frequencies: After R and A, common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

So, perhaps ""Arise""? A R I S E – but E is excluded? Yes, E ❌ in feedback. Guess ""crane"" had E❌.  
""Arise"" has E – bad.

""Trial""? T R I A L – positions: T(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), L(5)  
A is fourth! Perfect. Confirmed letters: R at 2, A at 4 (not 3). Letters: T, R, I, A, L – no C,N,E.  
Also, T and I and L are new tests.

So ""Trial"" seems good:  
- T in position 1  
- R position 2 ✅  
- I in position 3  
- A in position 4 (so A should not be ✓ if game confirms position, but we'll see)  
- L in position 5

This tests I and L and T.

Another option was ""Broad"": B R O A D  
B new, O new, A at 4, D new.

But ""Trial"" has the advantage of using S,L,T,I which are common.

Though I like ""Trial"" because it places A in a new spot (fourth) to test.

So I'll go with ""Trial"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane""):
- ✅ R is correct and in position 2.
- ➖ A is in the word but not in position 3.
- ❌ C, N, and E are not in the word.

For the next guess:
1. Must keep R in position 2 since its position is confirmed.
2. Must include A but not in position 3 (so position 1, 4, or 5).
3. Cannot use C, N, or E again.
4. Aim to test new common letters (e.g., T, L, I, S, O, D) to gather more information.

Considering words that fit these constraints:
- ""Trial"": Places R in position 2, A in position 4 (avoiding position 3), uses T, I, and L (new letters), and excludes C/N/E. This efficiently tests multiple letters.
- Alternatives like ""Broad"" (A in position 4) or ""Brand"" (but N is excluded) were also considered, but ""Trial"" tests more common letters and positions.

Therefore, ""Trial"" is a strong choice to narrow down possibilities.

Like ""Orbit""? O R B I T – no A? Doesn’t include A.

Word containing A in fourth: ""Trap"" is 4 letters, too short. Need 5 letters. ""Frail""? F R A I L – A in pos 3 again. No.

""Broil""? B R O I L – no A.  

Need to include A somewhere not third.

Try: _ R _ _ A → fifth position  
Words: ""Opera"" is O-P-E-R-A – R is fourth, not second. No, structure must have R second.

So consistent pattern: Position 1,2,3,4,5:  
- Pos 1: ?  
- Pos 2: R  
- Pos 3: not A  
- Pos 4: could be A  
- Pos 5: could be A  

If A is fourth: _ R X A Y  
If A is fifth: _ R X Y A  

Now find words with R second, A in either fourth or fifth, no C,N,E.

Options for fourth position A:  
- ""Gravy""? G R A V Y – A is third? G(1), R(2), A(3) – forbidden.  

A in fourth: Position 3 must not be A. So word like:  
- ""? R ? A ?""  

Example: ""Orcas""? O R C A S – C excluded? C is unused but feedback said C is out, so avoid C.  
Also, no C,N,E.  

Another: ""Frail"" not good. ""Trail""? T R A I L – A third, no.  

""Brand""? B R A N D – N excluded? Feedback says N ❌.  

Avoid N.

""Broad""? B R O A D – A is fourth? Positions: B(1), R(2), O(3), A(4), D(5). Yes, A is fourth.  
Letters: B, R, O, A, D  
Avoid C,N,E? O is new, D new. All allowed?  

But O wasn't tested yet. Same for D.

Another choice: ""Grail""? G R A I L – A in third, no.

""March""? M A R C H – R is third? No structure issue.

Keep focus: R in second.

Another word: ""Frost""? F R O S T – but no A? Need to include A since it's in the word.

Important: I must include A in the guess because it's confirmed in the word, just not position 3.

So my guess should contain A somewhere else.

Back to ""Broad"": B R O A D  
- B (new)  
- R fixed in pos 2  
- O new  
- A in pos 4 (not 3, good)  
- D new  

Another word: ""Broth""? B R O T H – no A.

""Bravo""? B R A V O – A in pos 3. Forbidden.

""Crawl""? C excluded.

Use letter frequencies: After R and A, common letters: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

So, perhaps ""Arise""? A R I S E – but E is excluded? Yes, E ❌ in feedback. Guess ""crane"" had E❌.  
""Arise"" has E – bad.

""Trial""? T R I A L – positions: T(1), R(2), I(3), A(4), L(5)  
A is fourth! Perfect. Confirmed letters: R at 2, A at 4 (not 3). Letters: T, R, I, A, L – no C,N,E.  
Also, T and I and L are new tests.

So ""Trial"" seems good:  
- T in position 1  
- R position 2 ✅  
- I in position 3  
- A in position 4 (so A should not be ✓ if game confirms position, but we'll see)  
- L in position 5

This tests I and L and T.

Another option was ""Broad"": B R O A D  
B new, O new, A at 4, D new.

But ""Trial"" has the advantage of using S,L,T,I which are common.

Though I like ""Trial"" because it places A in a new spot (fourth) to test.

So I'll go with ""Trial"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane""):
- ✅ R is correct and in position 2.
- ➖ A is in the word but not in position 3.
- ❌ C, N, and E are not in the word.

For the next guess:
1. Must keep R in position 2 since its position is confirmed.
2. Must include A but not in position 3 (so position 1, 4, or 5).
3. Cannot use C, N, or E again.
4. Aim to test new common letters (e.g., T, L, I, S, O, D) to gather more information.

Considering words that fit these constraints:
- ""Trial"": Places R in position 2, A in position 4 (avoiding position 3), uses T, I, and L (new letters), and excludes C/N/E. This efficiently tests multiple letters.
- Alternatives like ""Broad"" (A in position 4) or ""Brand"" (but N is excluded) were also considered, but ""Trial"" tests more common letters and positions.

Therefore, ""Trial"" is a strong choice to narrow down possibilities.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - R is in the word and in position 2 (correct).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""trial"": T(x) R(✓) I(x) A(-) L(x)
   - R is still correct in position 2 (as expected).
   - A is present (so must be in a position other than 3 and 4? Because in ""trial"", A was in position 4 and got a minus, meaning it's in the word but not in position 4).
   - T, I, L are not in the word.

Now, consolidating information:
- R is fixed in position 2.
- A must be in the word, but we have two clues about its position:
   - From ""crane"": not position 3.
   - From ""trial"": not position 4 (because it showed -, meaning present but wrong position).
- Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 3 and 4 are now ruled out).
- Letters excluded: C, E, N, T, I, L.

Now, the word has R in position 2 and A in either position 1 or 5.

We also know that the word does not contain any of the excluded letters.

We have two cases:

Case 1: A at position 1 → Word: A R ? ? ?
Case 2: A at position 5 → Word: ? R ? ? A

We need to guess a word that includes A in either position 1 or 5, has R in position 2, and does not include C, E, N, T, I, L.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Considering the available letters, we should use letters not yet tested. From the alphabet, excluding C, E, N, T, I, L, and R (already placed) and A (used but position unknown).

Available common vowels: O, U (since A is the only vowel we have, and we haven't tested O or U).
Available common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, constructing words:

First, Case 1: A at position 1 → A R ? ? ?
The third, fourth, fifth positions need to be filled with letters from the available set.

Possible words:
- ""Arson"": A R S O N → but N is excluded? N is not allowed (feedback from crane).
- ""Arrow"": A R R O W → duplicate R? But the word might have duplicates? However, we don't know. The secret word could have duplicates, but let's avoid for now unless necessary. Also, O is new.
   - But ""arrow"" has two R's: if the secret word has only one R, then the second R would show as (-) or (x) depending on position? Anyway, we have to consider it. But let's see if there's a better word without duplicates.
- ""Argue"": A R G U E → E is excluded? Yes, E is not allowed. So no.
- ""Arbor"": A R B O R → again duplicate R? But O and B new.
- ""Aroma"": A R O M A → has A twice? If A is at position 1 and 5? Well, that's possible. Letters: A, R, O, M, A. But we haven't tested O and M.

But note: in Case 1, if A is at position 1, then the last letter could be something else (since A might be only once).

Other words: ""Array""? A R R A Y → duplicates.
- ""Aspro""? Not common.

Let me think of more words: ""Apart""? But starts with A, but then A P A R T? Positions: A at 1 and 3? But we avoided position 3 for A? No, in this case position 1 is A, position 3 would be another letter? ""Apart"" isn't starting with A R? It's A-P-A-R-T → no, second position is P.

We need A and then R at position 2. So the word must be A R ....

Another word: ""Arcad"" ? Not common.
""Arise"" has E and I excluded.
""Drama"" starts with D, not A.

Perhaps case 1 has limited words without excluded letters.

Case 2: A at position 5 → ? R ? ? A
Word: _ R _ _ A

Now, we can fill position 1,3,4.

Possible words:
- ""Train"" - T is excluded? T(x) from trial.
- ""Tragic"" - too long? 5 letters only, so:
Let's list 5-letter words ending with A: ...A

Common words: ""Opera"" - O P E R A? But E excluded and R is not in position 2? In ""opera"", positions: O(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), A(5) → R is not at position 2, so structure not matched.

We need position 2 to be R: so ? R ? ? A

Words: 
- ""Grave"": G R A V E → E excluded? Also, A is in position 3? But we have A must be either position 1 or 5. In this word, A is at position 3? G(1) R(2) A(3) V(4) E(5) → but in case 2, we are assuming A at 5? But here A is at 3? Confusion.

Case 2 assumes A at position 5, so the fifth letter must be A. So ""? R ? ? A""

Meaning:
Pos1: ?, Pos2: R, Pos3: ?, Pos4: ?, Pos5: A

So the word pattern is: [letter] R [letter] [letter] A

Now, available letters: no C,E,N,T,I,L.

Possible words:
- ""Urbia"" - not common? Not sure.
- ""Orb a"" no.
- ""Bream"": B R E A M → E excluded? E is not allowed? ""Bream"" has E.
- ""Dread"": D R E A D → E excluded.
- ""Freak"": F R E A K → E excluded.

Without E? 
- ""Broca""? Not common.
- ""Frown"" - ends with N, and fifth letter not A? No: _R_ _ A

Words like:
- ""Scuba"" but S? S not excluded? But C excluded? ""Scuba"" has C? S-C-U-B-A → C excluded? From crane feedback C(x), so avoid C.

Another: ""Brava""? B R A V A → A is in position 3? B(1) R(2) A(3) V(4) A(5) → but we are avoiding A in position 3? Because from feedback, A cannot be at position 3 (from crane) and also cannot be at position 4 (from trial) so A must be 1 or 5. But in this word, A is at 3 and 5? Position 3: A is present? But we know A must not be at position 3? So invalid? 

Thus, if A is at position 5, then in positions 1,3,4 we must not have A? Or we can? But we already know from feedback that A is in the word, and if it appears multiple times, we want to test.

But from feedback: in first guess, A was in position 3 got (-) meaning the letter is in the word but not that position? So there might be multiple occurrences? Or one elsewhere? Similarly in second guess, A in position 4 got (-), meaning it is in the word but not position 4? Therefore, the secret word must have A in exactly one or more? If there were an A in position 5 and A in position 1, then when we guess A in position 3, it would show (-) if it exists elsewhere? Likewise.

But to simplify, let’s assume we avoid putting A in known wrong positions? We don’t know if duplicate A exists.

Back to case 2: word ? R ? ? A

Possible words without excluded letters:
- ""Frugal"" - 6 letters? Need 5 letters.
- ""Orcat"" no.
- ""Drama"": D R A M A → positions: D(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5) → A at position 3? But position 3 must not A? Because from first feedback A not in position 3? So if we guess ""drama"", and the secret word indeed has A not at position 3, but at position 5, then the A at position 3 would show as (x) or (-) ? 

Actually, if the word has only one A, say at position 5, then:
- In ""crane"", we had A at position 3: it would show (-) meaning it exists elsewhere. But that matched.
- In ""trial"", A at position 4: show (-) meaning elsewhere.

But if we guess a word with A at position 3 again? We'll avoid that.

For case 2 words: we want to not put A at positions 3 or 4? So the third and fourth letters cannot be A.

So for ? R	? ? A, positions 3 and 4 must be non-A letters? And position 1 also non-A? Unless we are case 1? 

This is for case 2: A only at 5? So no A in 1,3,4? Or could be? But feedback hasn't shown duplicate.

Since we've only one A detected, assume one A for now.

Therefore, in case 2, word: X1 R X2 X3 A, where X1, X2, X3 are not A and not excluded letters.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now find common words:
- ""GRA MA"" no, ""Grava""? Not English.
- ""Broma"": B R O M A → Broma: a type of cocktail? Uncommon.
- Other: ""Droop"" ends with P? No, ends with A? No.
- ""Frama"" not common.

Commonly used words:
- ""Opera"": O P E R A? No, position: O(1) P(2) ... but we need position 2 R: structure fixed to ? R ? ? A

So: try ""opera"" pattern: cannot.

Better: ""Vroom"" no A?

Words ending with A: pizza but Z? Not.

""Pasta"" - P A S T A? Not ? R ? ? A.

""Karma"": K A R M A? Position 2 is A? Not R.

We need position 2 to be R.

Another word: ""Array"": A R R A Y? But position 1 is A? That's case 1.

For case 2, let's think of words: ""UranA"" no.

""Barra"" B A R R A? Position 2 is A? Not.

 ""Extra"": E X T R A? Position 4 is R? Not 2.

This is difficult.

Perhaps case 2 has fewer common words? Maybe case 1 is more likely.

Let's go back to case 1: A at position 1 → A R ? ? ?

Pattern: A R ? ? ?

With ? being not excluded (C,E,N,T,I,L) and not necessarily A? But we can have other letters.

Also, avoid R in other positions? But not necessary.

With available letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,S,U,V,W,Y,...

Common words:
- A R O S E → but E excluded? No.
- A R O M A → A R O M A → letters: A (at1), R (at2), O, M, A (at5)? So if we guess ""aroma"", and the secret word has A at position 5? Then the A at position 1: if the word has no A at 1 or A elsewhere?

In ""aroma"", if the secret word has A at position 1, then positions: 
- A at1: correct? But we are in case 1 hypothesis.
- But A at5 is also present? Would we be testing both.

But better to test one case at a time? Or use a word that can help distinguish?

Since we have two cases, we try a word that covers both? Not easy.

Alternatively, guess a word that has A at position 1 (case 1) but avoid using letters that are excluded.

Potential words for case 1:
- ""Arrow"": A R R O W → but duplicate R? And W, O tested.
- ""Arbor"": A R B O R → duplicate R?
- ""Argon"": A R G O N → N excluded? No, N not allowed.
- ""Argot"": A R G O T → T excluded? From trial T(x), so T not allowed.
- ""Armor"": A R M O R → duplicate R? O and M new.
- ""Aroma"": A R O M A → A at position 1 and 5? But that might be helpful: if the secret word is case 1 (A at1) and also possible A at5? Or not.

But ""aroma"" uses M and O.

Other word: ""Aspen"" has E and N? Excluded.

""Azure"" has E and U? U new, but E excluded.

Perhaps ""Arums"": U and S? Not common.

Let's list: ""Aroid"" - O and D? Hmm.

Another: ""Artsy"" A R T S Y? T excluded.

""Ardor"": A R D O R → duplicate R? D and O.

Again, duplicate R is a problem? Let's include R again? Not excluded.

But the feedback may be messy. But okay.

I think ""arrow"" is more common: A R R O W.

This will test if R can be duplicate? And if R is at position 3 or 4 then it would show (-) or (x) depending.

Similarly, O at position 4 and W at position 5.

But we are considering case 1: A at position 1.

Alternatively, for case 2, if we guess a word with R at2 and A at5, and no other issues.

Found a common word for case 2: ""opera"" doesn't work, but what about ""praya"" or ""umbra""?

""Umbra"": U M B R A → positions: U(1) M(2) B(3) R(4) A(5)? So R is at position 4? Not 2.

""Fraud"": F R A U D? A at position 3? Not.

""Gra  a""? No.

""Orca"" is short.

So perhaps case 2 is not a common word? Maybe focus on case 1.

Perhaps we should guess a word that includes A at position 5 to test case 2 explicitly? And avoid positions 3 and 4 for A.

Word with R at position 2 and A at position 5: _ R _ _ A

Common words:
- ""Opera"" is not because R not at 2.
- ""Extra"" has R at 4? No.
- ""Greta"": G R E T A? E and T excluded? No.
- ""Bread"": B R E A D? E excluded.

To avoid E: ""Dryad""? D R Y A D? A at position 4? But we need A at position 5? ""Dryad"" is D(1) R(2) Y(3) A(4) D(5) → A at position 4, which we know is wrong? Because from trial feedback, A not at position 4.

So this word puts A at position 4, which would show (-) or (x) ? But position 4 is bad for A? We already know position 4 is wrong? So not helpful.

Similarly, word with A at position 5: let's list some:
- ""Manta"": M A N T A? N and T excluded, and position 2 is A? Not R.
- ""Panda"": P A N D A? N excluded, position 2 A? Not R.

The challenge is to have R exactly at position 2.

Rare? But exists: 
- ""Trout"" not end with A.
- ""Buxom"" not end with A.

Perhaps ""S  A"": ""Sudra""? Not common.

A better approach: instead of guessing the case directly, guess a word that contains A and R at position 2, and test other letters.

Since A must be at position 1 or 5, we can try a word with A at position 1 (case 1) with common letters.

For example: ""Arose"" has E excluded.

""Arise"" has E? And I excluded from trial? ""Trial"" had I(x), so I not in word? ""Arise"" has I and E, both excluded.

""Arson"": A R S O N → N excluded? No.

""Aroud"" Not a word.

""Arbor"": A R B O R → duplicate R, but letters B, O new.

Or ""Aroid"": A R O I D → I excluded? ""Trial"" I(x) so I not in word.

""I"" is excluded.

So avoid I.

Here's a word: ""Aroma"" A R O M A
- A at position 1 and 5.
- R at position 2.
- O at position 3.
- M at position 4.

And no excluded letters: C,E,N,T,I,L.

So we can guess ""aroma"".

If the secret word has A at position 1, then:
- Position 1: A should be ✓ if case 1? Not necessarily, if there's duplicate then position 1 might be correct or not? But in this guess, position 1 is A.

Similarly, position 5 is A.

Also, position 2 is R – known to be correct.

O and M are new.

So, by guessing ""aroma"", we can:
- Confirm if A is at position 1 or 5? Or both?
- Test O, M.

Also, if A is not at position 1 or 5? But that's impossible based on previous feedback? Because it must be at 1 or 5.

So, let's go with ""aroma"".

As for case 2, if the word has A at position 5 and not at 1, and no A at position 1, then in ""aroma"":
- Position 1: A would be (x) or (-) ? If there's no A at position 1, but there is an A at position 5, then position 1 A would show as minus if it exists elsewhere? But this is complicated, but we will get feedback.

Perhaps choose ""arrow"" to avoid duplicate A? But has duplicate R.

""Arrow"": A R R O W 
- Positions: A(1), R(2), R(3), O(4), W(5)
- Tests O, W.

But duplicate R at position 3: if the secret word has only one R, the third position R would show x or -? But we don't know.

To test more letters, ""parks"" but P at1, etc.

I think ""aroma"" is reasonable.

So I'll guess ""aroma"".

But we're on guess 3.

Summary:
- We know R is fixed at position 2.
- A is present and must be at position 1 or 5.
- Excluded letters: C,E,N,T,I,L.

With ""aroma"":
- Covers case 1: A at position 1.
- And tests position 5 A.
- Also tests O at position 3 and M at position 4.

This will give information about O and M and whether A is at 1 or 5.

Therefore, guess: aroma

<guess>aroma</guess>
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(❌) R(✅) A(➖) N(❌) E(❌)  
  - R is confirmed in position 2.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - C, N, E are not in the word.  
- **Guess 2: trial** → T(❌) R(✅) I(❌) A(➖) L(❌)  
  - R is still verified in position 2.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - T, I, L are not in the word.  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Consolidate Known Information**:  
   - Position 2 must be **R** (from both guesses).  
   - **A** is in the word but cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (ruled out by feedback). Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 5.  
   - Excluded letters: C, E, N, T, I, L (❌ from feedback).  
   - Available/common letters to test: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

2. **Possible Word Structures**:  
   - **Case 1**: A at position 1 (e.g., _A R _ _ _).  
   - **Case 2**: A at position 5 (e.g., _ _ _ R A).  
   - The next guess should resolve this ambiguity by placing A in position 1 (to test Case 1) while including new common letters to gather more feedback.  

3. **Selecting the Guess**:  
   - Use a word with **A in position 1**, R in position 2, and common letters from the available pool.  
   - Avoid repeating excluded letters and prioritizing untested common letters like O or M.  
   - **""Aroma""** fits well:  
     - Structure: A (position 1), R (position 2), O (position 3, new), M (position 4, new), A (position 5).  
     - Tests both potential positions for A (1 and 5).  
     - Uses O and M, which are frequent and untested.  
     - No excluded letters: C, E, N, T, I, L are avoided.  
   - If A is only in position 1, position 5 A in ""aroma"" might show ❌ or ➖, clarifying duplicates. If A is in position 5, position 1 A might show ❌ or ➖, helping to distinguish cases.  
   - Feedback on O and M will reveal their presence/absence and positions.  

<guess>aroma</guess>",aroma,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"": C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(x)
   - R is in the word and in position 2 (correct).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.
   - C, N, E are not in the word.

2. ""trial"": T(x) R(✓) I(x) A(-) L(x)
   - R is still correct in position 2 (as expected).
   - A is present (so must be in a position other than 3 and 4? Because in ""trial"", A was in position 4 and got a minus, meaning it's in the word but not in position 4).
   - T, I, L are not in the word.

Now, consolidating information:
- R is fixed in position 2.
- A must be in the word, but we have two clues about its position:
   - From ""crane"": not position 3.
   - From ""trial"": not position 4 (because it showed -, meaning present but wrong position).
- Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 5 (since positions 3 and 4 are now ruled out).
- Letters excluded: C, E, N, T, I, L.

Now, the word has R in position 2 and A in either position 1 or 5.

We also know that the word does not contain any of the excluded letters.

We have two cases:

Case 1: A at position 1 → Word: A R ? ? ?
Case 2: A at position 5 → Word: ? R ? ? A

We need to guess a word that includes A in either position 1 or 5, has R in position 2, and does not include C, E, N, T, I, L.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Considering the available letters, we should use letters not yet tested. From the alphabet, excluding C, E, N, T, I, L, and R (already placed) and A (used but position unknown).

Available common vowels: O, U (since A is the only vowel we have, and we haven't tested O or U).
Available common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, constructing words:

First, Case 1: A at position 1 → A R ? ? ?
The third, fourth, fifth positions need to be filled with letters from the available set.

Possible words:
- ""Arson"": A R S O N → but N is excluded? N is not allowed (feedback from crane).
- ""Arrow"": A R R O W → duplicate R? But the word might have duplicates? However, we don't know. The secret word could have duplicates, but let's avoid for now unless necessary. Also, O is new.
   - But ""arrow"" has two R's: if the secret word has only one R, then the second R would show as (-) or (x) depending on position? Anyway, we have to consider it. But let's see if there's a better word without duplicates.
- ""Argue"": A R G U E → E is excluded? Yes, E is not allowed. So no.
- ""Arbor"": A R B O R → again duplicate R? But O and B new.
- ""Aroma"": A R O M A → has A twice? If A is at position 1 and 5? Well, that's possible. Letters: A, R, O, M, A. But we haven't tested O and M.

But note: in Case 1, if A is at position 1, then the last letter could be something else (since A might be only once).

Other words: ""Array""? A R R A Y → duplicates.
- ""Aspro""? Not common.

Let me think of more words: ""Apart""? But starts with A, but then A P A R T? Positions: A at 1 and 3? But we avoided position 3 for A? No, in this case position 1 is A, position 3 would be another letter? ""Apart"" isn't starting with A R? It's A-P-A-R-T → no, second position is P.

We need A and then R at position 2. So the word must be A R ....

Another word: ""Arcad"" ? Not common.
""Arise"" has E and I excluded.
""Drama"" starts with D, not A.

Perhaps case 1 has limited words without excluded letters.

Case 2: A at position 5 → ? R ? ? A
Word: _ R _ _ A

Now, we can fill position 1,3,4.

Possible words:
- ""Train"" - T is excluded? T(x) from trial.
- ""Tragic"" - too long? 5 letters only, so:
Let's list 5-letter words ending with A: ...A

Common words: ""Opera"" - O P E R A? But E excluded and R is not in position 2? In ""opera"", positions: O(1), P(2), E(3), R(4), A(5) → R is not at position 2, so structure not matched.

We need position 2 to be R: so ? R ? ? A

Words: 
- ""Grave"": G R A V E → E excluded? Also, A is in position 3? But we have A must be either position 1 or 5. In this word, A is at position 3? G(1) R(2) A(3) V(4) E(5) → but in case 2, we are assuming A at 5? But here A is at 3? Confusion.

Case 2 assumes A at position 5, so the fifth letter must be A. So ""? R ? ? A""

Meaning:
Pos1: ?, Pos2: R, Pos3: ?, Pos4: ?, Pos5: A

So the word pattern is: [letter] R [letter] [letter] A

Now, available letters: no C,E,N,T,I,L.

Possible words:
- ""Urbia"" - not common? Not sure.
- ""Orb a"" no.
- ""Bream"": B R E A M → E excluded? E is not allowed? ""Bream"" has E.
- ""Dread"": D R E A D → E excluded.
- ""Freak"": F R E A K → E excluded.

Without E? 
- ""Broca""? Not common.
- ""Frown"" - ends with N, and fifth letter not A? No: _R_ _ A

Words like:
- ""Scuba"" but S? S not excluded? But C excluded? ""Scuba"" has C? S-C-U-B-A → C excluded? From crane feedback C(x), so avoid C.

Another: ""Brava""? B R A V A → A is in position 3? B(1) R(2) A(3) V(4) A(5) → but we are avoiding A in position 3? Because from feedback, A cannot be at position 3 (from crane) and also cannot be at position 4 (from trial) so A must be 1 or 5. But in this word, A is at 3 and 5? Position 3: A is present? But we know A must not be at position 3? So invalid? 

Thus, if A is at position 5, then in positions 1,3,4 we must not have A? Or we can? But we already know from feedback that A is in the word, and if it appears multiple times, we want to test.

But from feedback: in first guess, A was in position 3 got (-) meaning the letter is in the word but not that position? So there might be multiple occurrences? Or one elsewhere? Similarly in second guess, A in position 4 got (-), meaning it is in the word but not position 4? Therefore, the secret word must have A in exactly one or more? If there were an A in position 5 and A in position 1, then when we guess A in position 3, it would show (-) if it exists elsewhere? Likewise.

But to simplify, let’s assume we avoid putting A in known wrong positions? We don’t know if duplicate A exists.

Back to case 2: word ? R ? ? A

Possible words without excluded letters:
- ""Frugal"" - 6 letters? Need 5 letters.
- ""Orcat"" no.
- ""Drama"": D R A M A → positions: D(1), R(2), A(3), M(4), A(5) → A at position 3? But position 3 must not A? Because from first feedback A not in position 3? So if we guess ""drama"", and the secret word indeed has A not at position 3, but at position 5, then the A at position 3 would show as (x) or (-) ? 

Actually, if the word has only one A, say at position 5, then:
- In ""crane"", we had A at position 3: it would show (-) meaning it exists elsewhere. But that matched.
- In ""trial"", A at position 4: show (-) meaning elsewhere.

But if we guess a word with A at position 3 again? We'll avoid that.

For case 2 words: we want to not put A at positions 3 or 4? So the third and fourth letters cannot be A.

So for ? R	? ? A, positions 3 and 4 must be non-A letters? And position 1 also non-A? Unless we are case 1? 

This is for case 2: A only at 5? So no A in 1,3,4? Or could be? But feedback hasn't shown duplicate.

Since we've only one A detected, assume one A for now.

Therefore, in case 2, word: X1 R X2 X3 A, where X1, X2, X3 are not A and not excluded letters.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now find common words:
- ""GRA MA"" no, ""Grava""? Not English.
- ""Broma"": B R O M A → Broma: a type of cocktail? Uncommon.
- Other: ""Droop"" ends with P? No, ends with A? No.
- ""Frama"" not common.

Commonly used words:
- ""Opera"": O P E R A? No, position: O(1) P(2) ... but we need position 2 R: structure fixed to ? R ? ? A

So: try ""opera"" pattern: cannot.

Better: ""Vroom"" no A?

Words ending with A: pizza but Z? Not.

""Pasta"" - P A S T A? Not ? R ? ? A.

""Karma"": K A R M A? Position 2 is A? Not R.

We need position 2 to be R.

Another word: ""Array"": A R R A Y? But position 1 is A? That's case 1.

For case 2, let's think of words: ""UranA"" no.

""Barra"" B A R R A? Position 2 is A? Not.

 ""Extra"": E X T R A? Position 4 is R? Not 2.

This is difficult.

Perhaps case 2 has fewer common words? Maybe case 1 is more likely.

Let's go back to case 1: A at position 1 → A R ? ? ?

Pattern: A R ? ? ?

With ? being not excluded (C,E,N,T,I,L) and not necessarily A? But we can have other letters.

Also, avoid R in other positions? But not necessary.

With available letters: B,D,F,G,H,K,M,O,P,S,U,V,W,Y,...

Common words:
- A R O S E → but E excluded? No.
- A R O M A → A R O M A → letters: A (at1), R (at2), O, M, A (at5)? So if we guess ""aroma"", and the secret word has A at position 5? Then the A at position 1: if the word has no A at 1 or A elsewhere?

In ""aroma"", if the secret word has A at position 1, then positions: 
- A at1: correct? But we are in case 1 hypothesis.
- But A at5 is also present? Would we be testing both.

But better to test one case at a time? Or use a word that can help distinguish?

Since we have two cases, we try a word that covers both? Not easy.

Alternatively, guess a word that has A at position 1 (case 1) but avoid using letters that are excluded.

Potential words for case 1:
- ""Arrow"": A R R O W → but duplicate R? And W, O tested.
- ""Arbor"": A R B O R → duplicate R?
- ""Argon"": A R G O N → N excluded? No, N not allowed.
- ""Argot"": A R G O T → T excluded? From trial T(x), so T not allowed.
- ""Armor"": A R M O R → duplicate R? O and M new.
- ""Aroma"": A R O M A → A at position 1 and 5? But that might be helpful: if the secret word is case 1 (A at1) and also possible A at5? Or not.

But ""aroma"" uses M and O.

Other word: ""Aspen"" has E and N? Excluded.

""Azure"" has E and U? U new, but E excluded.

Perhaps ""Arums"": U and S? Not common.

Let's list: ""Aroid"" - O and D? Hmm.

Another: ""Artsy"" A R T S Y? T excluded.

""Ardor"": A R D O R → duplicate R? D and O.

Again, duplicate R is a problem? Let's include R again? Not excluded.

But the feedback may be messy. But okay.

I think ""arrow"" is more common: A R R O W.

This will test if R can be duplicate? And if R is at position 3 or 4 then it would show (-) or (x) depending.

Similarly, O at position 4 and W at position 5.

But we are considering case 1: A at position 1.

Alternatively, for case 2, if we guess a word with R at2 and A at5, and no other issues.

Found a common word for case 2: ""opera"" doesn't work, but what about ""praya"" or ""umbra""?

""Umbra"": U M B R A → positions: U(1) M(2) B(3) R(4) A(5)? So R is at position 4? Not 2.

""Fraud"": F R A U D? A at position 3? Not.

""Gra  a""? No.

""Orca"" is short.

So perhaps case 2 is not a common word? Maybe focus on case 1.

Perhaps we should guess a word that includes A at position 5 to test case 2 explicitly? And avoid positions 3 and 4 for A.

Word with R at position 2 and A at position 5: _ R _ _ A

Common words:
- ""Opera"" is not because R not at 2.
- ""Extra"" has R at 4? No.
- ""Greta"": G R E T A? E and T excluded? No.
- ""Bread"": B R E A D? E excluded.

To avoid E: ""Dryad""? D R Y A D? A at position 4? But we need A at position 5? ""Dryad"" is D(1) R(2) Y(3) A(4) D(5) → A at position 4, which we know is wrong? Because from trial feedback, A not at position 4.

So this word puts A at position 4, which would show (-) or (x) ? But position 4 is bad for A? We already know position 4 is wrong? So not helpful.

Similarly, word with A at position 5: let's list some:
- ""Manta"": M A N T A? N and T excluded, and position 2 is A? Not R.
- ""Panda"": P A N D A? N excluded, position 2 A? Not R.

The challenge is to have R exactly at position 2.

Rare? But exists: 
- ""Trout"" not end with A.
- ""Buxom"" not end with A.

Perhaps ""S  A"": ""Sudra""? Not common.

A better approach: instead of guessing the case directly, guess a word that contains A and R at position 2, and test other letters.

Since A must be at position 1 or 5, we can try a word with A at position 1 (case 1) with common letters.

For example: ""Arose"" has E excluded.

""Arise"" has E? And I excluded from trial? ""Trial"" had I(x), so I not in word? ""Arise"" has I and E, both excluded.

""Arson"": A R S O N → N excluded? No.

""Aroud"" Not a word.

""Arbor"": A R B O R → duplicate R, but letters B, O new.

Or ""Aroid"": A R O I D → I excluded? ""Trial"" I(x) so I not in word.

""I"" is excluded.

So avoid I.

Here's a word: ""Aroma"" A R O M A
- A at position 1 and 5.
- R at position 2.
- O at position 3.
- M at position 4.

And no excluded letters: C,E,N,T,I,L.

So we can guess ""aroma"".

If the secret word has A at position 1, then:
- Position 1: A should be ✓ if case 1? Not necessarily, if there's duplicate then position 1 might be correct or not? But in this guess, position 1 is A.

Similarly, position 5 is A.

Also, position 2 is R – known to be correct.

O and M are new.

So, by guessing ""aroma"", we can:
- Confirm if A is at position 1 or 5? Or both?
- Test O, M.

Also, if A is not at position 1 or 5? But that's impossible based on previous feedback? Because it must be at 1 or 5.

So, let's go with ""aroma"".

As for case 2, if the word has A at position 5 and not at 1, and no A at position 1, then in ""aroma"":
- Position 1: A would be (x) or (-) ? If there's no A at position 1, but there is an A at position 5, then position 1 A would show as minus if it exists elsewhere? But this is complicated, but we will get feedback.

Perhaps choose ""arrow"" to avoid duplicate A? But has duplicate R.

""Arrow"": A R R O W 
- Positions: A(1), R(2), R(3), O(4), W(5)
- Tests O, W.

But duplicate R at position 3: if the secret word has only one R, the third position R would show x or -? But we don't know.

To test more letters, ""parks"" but P at1, etc.

I think ""aroma"" is reasonable.

So I'll guess ""aroma"".

But we're on guess 3.

Summary:
- We know R is fixed at position 2.
- A is present and must be at position 1 or 5.
- Excluded letters: C,E,N,T,I,L.

With ""aroma"":
- Covers case 1: A at position 1.
- And tests position 5 A.
- Also tests O at position 3 and M at position 4.

This will give information about O and M and whether A is at 1 or 5.

Therefore, guess: aroma

<guess>aroma</guess>Based on the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → C(❌) R(✅) A(➖) N(❌) E(❌)
