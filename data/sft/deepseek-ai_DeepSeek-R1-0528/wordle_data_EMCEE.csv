We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
 C(-)   R(x)   A(x)   N(x)   E(✓)

Interpretation:
- E is in the correct position (5th letter). So the secret word ends with E.
- C is in the word but not in the first position. Therefore, C is somewhere else in the word (positions 2, 3, or 4).
- R, A, N are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word ends with E: ___ E
- The word contains C, but not in position 1 (since C was guessed in position 1 and got ""-"", meaning it's elsewhere).
- R, A, N are absent.

Since R, A, N are absent, we should avoid these letters in future guesses.

For a new guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending with E because position 5 is E (from feedback).
- The word should contain C (since we know C is in the word) but not in the first position? Actually, we can't put C in position 1 because in the feedback, C was in position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning that while C is in the word, it's not in position 1. Therefore, C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
  But note: the word has C, and it is not in position 1 because we got a ""-"" for position 1. Also, since position 5 is E, C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Additionally, we must exclude R, A, N.

We are on the second guess. We want to use the information we have: the word has the letter C (not in position 1) and ends with E.

We can consider words that start with a letter we haven't tried yet (like S, T, etc.) and have C in positions 2, 3, or 4, and end with E.

How about ""SPICE""?
- S: new letter
- P: new letter
- I: new letter
- C: we are testing C in the 4th position (since in CRANE it was in position 1 and wrong, so now try a different position).
- E: at the end, which is fixed.

But note: in ""CRANE"", we got that E is correct at position 5, so any guess must have E in the 5th position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in the second position? Like ""SCONE""? But S, C, O, N, E. But we know N is absent (from previous feedback: N(x)), so we cannot use N.

We cannot use letters that were marked absent: R, A, N.

Let me list the constraints:
- Position 5: E
- Letters present: C (in position 2, 3, or 4)
- Letters not present: R, A, N

We can also consider that the word has exactly the E and the C, and then three other letters? But we don't know how many more.

Our next guess should aim to test multiple possibilities.

A word ending with E that has C in either position 2, 3, or 4 and doesn't contain R, A, N.

Let's think of words that end with E and have a C:

Possible words:
- With C in position 2: ...? Like SC _ _ E. E.g., ""SCENE"", ""SCOPE"", ""SCARE"", but we cannot use A (because A is absent) and R is absent. So ""SCENE"": S, C, E, N, E -> but N is absent and E in the third position? But we already know position 5 is E.

""SCENE"": S, C, E, N, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:E, 4:N, 5:E. But N is absent so we cannot use it. Also, E in position 3? We don't know about E elsewhere.

Actually, we only know about position 5 being E. E could appear elsewhere? But the feedback for E in ""CRANE"" was only position 5 having E, so that E elsewhere might be present or not? The feedback symbol only tells about the position we put it. Since we put E only in position 5, we don't know if E appears elsewhere? However, note that if E appeared elsewhere, we would have seen another symbol? But in the feedback, we only got one E marked as correct (position 5). The other letters were C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x). So there was no E in the word elsewhere? Actually, the feedback doesn't show multiple marks for a letter if it appears multiple times? Therefore, we must be cautious.

In Wordle rules: if a letter appears multiple times in the secret, and you guess it multiple times, each occurrence is evaluated separately. But if you guess a letter once and it appears multiple times, the feedback might only mark the correct/incorrect occurrences accordingly? Actually, no: the feedback is per position. So let us be precise:

In ""CRANE"":
- Position 1: C -> marked with dash (-), meaning C is in the word but not in position 1. It doesn't tell us how many times C appears, only that at least one C is in the word (but not at position 1).

Similarly, E at position 5 is marked as correct (✓) meaning that E is in the word at position 5. But it doesn't tell us if E appears elsewhere? Actually, the absence of an E mark elsewhere doesn't tell, because we didn't put E elsewhere.

So we know:
- The word has a E at position 5.
- The word has at least one C, but not at position 1.

Now for the guess, we are forced to end with E.

Another possibility: ""PRICE"" -> P, R, I, C, E. But we cannot use R because R is absent (from feedback: R(x)). So avoid R.

Similarly, avoid A and N.

So let's find a word without R, A, N, ending in E, and with a C in one of positions 2,3,4.

How about ""PLACE"": P, L, A, C, E -> but A is absent? We cannot use A.

How about ""SPICE"": S, P, I, C, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E. That seems good because S, P, I are new letters and we are testing C at position 4.

Alternatively, we could try ""SPACE"": S, P, A, C, E -> but A is absent so we shouldn't use A.

Another word: ""SLICE"": S, L, I, C, E -> avoids R, A, N.

Or ""SHICE"" - not valid? SHICE is not a word. 

Valid words: 
- SLICE: yes, a valid word.
- OPINE: O, P, I, N, E -> but N is absent? Cannot use N.
- Since we cannot use N, avoid it.

So SLICE might work: S, L, I, C, E.

But wait, in SLICE, we are putting C in position 4. Could we put C in position 2? Like ""SCALE"": S, C, A, L, E -> A is absent, not allowed.

Or ""SCOPE"": S, C, O, P, E -> O? not tried, P? not tried. E? at the end. What about the O? But SCOPE has O: so valid and without forbidden letters? Yes, because A, R, N are absent. O is new? Yes.

But we are trying C in position 2? In the first guess, C was tried in position 1 and got a dash. Now we try C in position 2: that'd be fine? But what if C is actually in position 3? We don't know. So either we try a word that moves the C to get more information.

But note: we know C is not in position 1, so positions 2,3,4 are possible. We can try a word that tests position 2? Or leave C out? We cannot leave C out because we are testing other letters? Actually, we must include the fact that C is present? No: we can guess without C? But why? We want to maximize information.

We can consider that the word must have C? So we should include C? Alternatively, we can test other letters without C? But we know C is present? Yes, absolutely: the dash in feedback for C means that at least one C is in the word. Therefore, we can use C again to try to pin down its position.

But note: we are only allowed to use valid words. So we must test letters we haven't tried? That's the idea? To use words that have many new letters? And try to see if they are present or absent? 

So for the second guess:

Option 1: include C and end with E, while testing three new positions (1,2,3) and having C in position 4 (like ""SPICE"", ""SLICE"", etc.)

Option 2: have C in position 2? Then the word must be S C ? ? E.

Possible words: ""SCOPE"" (S C O P E) which avoids R, A, N? Let's see: no A, no R, no N? Yes. O is not forbidden because we have not gotten feedback on O. Similarly, P wasn't tried.

Another: ""SCENE"" -> but N is absent? Cannot use. ""SCORE"" -> R is absent and O? R absent -> no. So ""SCOPE"" seems valid.

Or ""SCALE"": forbidden A -> no. ""SCUTE"" - not valid.

So between ""SCOPE"" (with C in position 2) and ""SLICE"" (with C in position 4). Which one? Both are valid.

Alternatively, we could put C in position 3? Like ""USICE"" -> not valid. Or ""EDUCE"": E D U C E -> but we are ending with E? Yes. Positions: 1:E, 2:D, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E. But we didn't try E elsewhere? We are putting E at position 1 and 5. The secret has E at position 5, but we don't know about position 1. However, we are not forbidden to try E elsewhere? Actually, we can. E could be in other positions? But note: in the feedback, E was only marked at position 5, so if we put E at position 1 and get a dash or nothing, that would tell us if there's another E. Or put E in position 1? It might be tricky.

But we have 6 tries, so we can test.

Another idea: use a word that has multiple E's? For example, ""EXILE"": E X I L E -> ends with E, as required. Then positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E. Then we would find out about E at position 1? But X is a low-frequency letter? Might not give much information.

So perhaps stick to common letters.

I think ""SCOPE"" and ""SLICE"" are both good options. But let me note that in ""SCOPE"", we put C in position 2. If we get C marked correct at position 2, we know it's correct; if dash, then C must be in 3 or 4? Actually, if C is in the word and not at position 2, then we would get a dash meaning it's present elsewhere? But we have position 1 as S? 

Alternatively, ""SLICE"": L in position 2? Then C in position 4.

Since we know C is present and not at position 1, I want to try a word with C in position 2? That is ""SCOPE"".

Or ""PRICE"", but R absent? Avoided.

So let me choose ""SCOPE"".

SCOPE: 
- Position 1: S -> might be? Not tested.
- Position 2: C -> if this is the correct position, we get ✓ for C? Otherwise, if C is at position 3 or 4, then we get a dash for position 2? Because C is in the word but not here? Then what? 

Actually, if we put C at position 2, and the secret word has C at position 4? Then we would get: 
- Position 1: S -> if S is absent? x? Or present? dash? 
- Position 2: C -> since C is actually at position 4, we would get a dash? Because C is in the word but here at location 2.
- Then position 3: O? might be absent?
- Position 4: P? then if P is present? but at position 4? 
This might not reveal much? 

Alternatively, a word that does not have C? Why? That could tell us that? We don't need because we know C is present? So we must include C? Because otherwise we might miss? Actually, no: we know C is present? So we can choose to put C in a different position? 

Actually, the best practice is to put letters we know are present in all subsequent guesses? So we must include C? And E at the end.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLICE"":

SLICE: L is at position 2? Then C at position 4? Then we test S in position 1? And L, I, and then E? 

But note: we already tested E? So only S? is new? Then we test S? 

Alternatively, we can try ""CHIME"": C H I M E -> ends with E? Yes. Then put C at position 1? But we know that C is not at position 1? So that would give a dash for position 1? Because C is in the word elsewhere? So same as using C again? 

But ""CHIME"": positions? C at 1 (which is wrong, so expected dash), H, I, M, E? Then we don't learn much? 

So why SLICE? Actually, let me try to choose ""SPICE"" to check S, P, I? 

But I think any valid word that ends in E and contains C (in positions 2,3,4) and avoids R, A, N is good.

To maximize information: we want to test at least two positions for C? Actually, we can't? In one guess we can test only one position. So I prefer ""SCOPE"" to test C at position 2? 

But note: ""SCOPE"" uses O? Which is less common than other letters? 

How about ""SLICE"": S, L, I, C, E -> all letters are good? 

We can also consider ""BEICE"" -> not valid. 

Valid common words: 
- PIECE: P,I,E,C,E -> but we have E in position 3? Then we have two E's? Positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E -> but position 3 and 5? Then we have E? We know E is at position 5? But position 3? We don't know? And C is at position 4? 

But PIECE is valid? Let me use PIECE? Actually, PIECE is 5 letter word? Yes. But let me spell: P-I-E-C-E. So positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E. 

Then we would test P? and I? and E at position 3? Then C at position 4? 

Since we know the secret ends with E? If there's two E's? Then PIECE testing? 

But why PIECE? 

Alternatively, ""SINCE"": S I N C E -> but N forbidden? Cannot.

""SWIFE"" - not valid? 

Better: ""SPIKE""? S P I K E -> ends with E? Yes. But does not contain C? But we know C is present? Why not include C? 

Therefore, we must include C? So must include C? So SPIKE doesn't include C? Then missed opportunity? 

We know C exists? So we should include it? Even if we don't cover more letters? 

No: we want to test C along with other letters? 

We have to use C? Because we have 6 guesses? And we must keep including confirmed letters? 

But C is confirmed? 

So to move forward: 

I think we should use a word that tests the positions for C? 

Also, we don't know which positions? So we can try a common word that places C in a different position? 

Let's pick ""SLICE"": 

Guess: SLICE 

Response format will tell us S at position 1? L at position 2? I at position 3? C at position 4? 

If the secret word has C at position 4? Then we get ✓ for C? Or elsewhere? Dash? 

Alternatively, we pick ""SHINE"" - doesn't have C? Avoid.

No, must include C? 

Therefore, I choose SLICE? Or SCOPE? 

Let me check: SCOPE (C at position 2) vs SLICE (C at position 4). 

But we can also consider ""CLOSE"": C, L, O, S, E -> ends with E? Yes. Avoids R,A,N? S and L, O? Then C at position 1? But we know C is not at position 1? So putting C at position 1 again? That's going to give a dash? Which is known? So we waste one letter? 

But we test O, S, L? 

So CLOSE: positions 1:C (will yield dash since not 1), L, O, S, E? 

Then it tests L, O, S? 

But E? We know? So it tests three letters? 

But what if the secret word has C at position 2? Then our L? and O? 

But we won't learn? 

Actually, I think ""CLOSE"" is acceptable? Because we test L, O, S? 

But the feedback: for position 1? C will be dash? Meaning again C is elsewhere? Then we don't get new information on C? 

Whereas if we put C in a new position? That could give new information? 

So I prefer to put C in a different position? 

So ""SLICE"": S at position 1, L at position 2, I at position 3, C at position 4, E at position 5. 

Then I'll go with that? 

Or another: ""SPICE"" 

I'll choose ""SPICE"". 

Why SPICE? It uses S, P, I, C, E? P is common too? 

We haven't tested these letters? Good.

Therefore, I decide: SPICE 

So the guess is SPICE. 
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- E is in the correct position (5th letter), so the secret word ends with E.
- C is present in the word but not in position 1, as indicated by ""-"". So C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- R, A, and N are not in the word, as shown by ""x"" for the other letters.

For the second guess:
- Must end with E to match the known position.
- Must include C, since it is confirmed to be in the word, but avoid positions where we know it doesn't belong (position 1).
- Cannot include R, A, or N, as they are absent.
- Aim to test new common letters in other positions for maximum information gain.

The word ""SPICE"" fits these criteria:
- Ends with E: position 5 is E.
- Places C in position 4: testing a new position for C (previously tried in position 1).
- Uses new letters S, P, I: these are untested and common, helping to reveal their presence/absence.
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N).

This guess efficiently targets possible positions for C while providing information on other high-frequency letters.

<guess>SPICE</guess>",SPICE,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
 C(-)   R(x)   A(x)   N(x)   E(✓)

Interpretation:
- E is in the correct position (5th letter). So the secret word ends with E.
- C is in the word but not in the first position. Therefore, C is somewhere else in the word (positions 2, 3, or 4).
- R, A, N are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word ends with E: ___ E
- The word contains C, but not in position 1 (since C was guessed in position 1 and got ""-"", meaning it's elsewhere).
- R, A, N are absent.

Since R, A, N are absent, we should avoid these letters in future guesses.

For a new guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending with E because position 5 is E (from feedback).
- The word should contain C (since we know C is in the word) but not in the first position? Actually, we can't put C in position 1 because in the feedback, C was in position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning that while C is in the word, it's not in position 1. Therefore, C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
  But note: the word has C, and it is not in position 1 because we got a ""-"" for position 1. Also, since position 5 is E, C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Additionally, we must exclude R, A, N.

We are on the second guess. We want to use the information we have: the word has the letter C (not in position 1) and ends with E.

We can consider words that start with a letter we haven't tried yet (like S, T, etc.) and have C in positions 2, 3, or 4, and end with E.

How about ""SPICE""?
- S: new letter
- P: new letter
- I: new letter
- C: we are testing C in the 4th position (since in CRANE it was in position 1 and wrong, so now try a different position).
- E: at the end, which is fixed.

But note: in ""CRANE"", we got that E is correct at position 5, so any guess must have E in the 5th position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in the second position? Like ""SCONE""? But S, C, O, N, E. But we know N is absent (from previous feedback: N(x)), so we cannot use N.

We cannot use letters that were marked absent: R, A, N.

Let me list the constraints:
- Position 5: E
- Letters present: C (in position 2, 3, or 4)
- Letters not present: R, A, N

We can also consider that the word has exactly the E and the C, and then three other letters? But we don't know how many more.

Our next guess should aim to test multiple possibilities.

A word ending with E that has C in either position 2, 3, or 4 and doesn't contain R, A, N.

Let's think of words that end with E and have a C:

Possible words:
- With C in position 2: ...? Like SC _ _ E. E.g., ""SCENE"", ""SCOPE"", ""SCARE"", but we cannot use A (because A is absent) and R is absent. So ""SCENE"": S, C, E, N, E -> but N is absent and E in the third position? But we already know position 5 is E.

""SCENE"": S, C, E, N, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:E, 4:N, 5:E. But N is absent so we cannot use it. Also, E in position 3? We don't know about E elsewhere.

Actually, we only know about position 5 being E. E could appear elsewhere? But the feedback for E in ""CRANE"" was only position 5 having E, so that E elsewhere might be present or not? The feedback symbol only tells about the position we put it. Since we put E only in position 5, we don't know if E appears elsewhere? However, note that if E appeared elsewhere, we would have seen another symbol? But in the feedback, we only got one E marked as correct (position 5). The other letters were C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x). So there was no E in the word elsewhere? Actually, the feedback doesn't show multiple marks for a letter if it appears multiple times? Therefore, we must be cautious.

In Wordle rules: if a letter appears multiple times in the secret, and you guess it multiple times, each occurrence is evaluated separately. But if you guess a letter once and it appears multiple times, the feedback might only mark the correct/incorrect occurrences accordingly? Actually, no: the feedback is per position. So let us be precise:

In ""CRANE"":
- Position 1: C -> marked with dash (-), meaning C is in the word but not in position 1. It doesn't tell us how many times C appears, only that at least one C is in the word (but not at position 1).

Similarly, E at position 5 is marked as correct (✓) meaning that E is in the word at position 5. But it doesn't tell us if E appears elsewhere? Actually, the absence of an E mark elsewhere doesn't tell, because we didn't put E elsewhere.

So we know:
- The word has a E at position 5.
- The word has at least one C, but not at position 1.

Now for the guess, we are forced to end with E.

Another possibility: ""PRICE"" -> P, R, I, C, E. But we cannot use R because R is absent (from feedback: R(x)). So avoid R.

Similarly, avoid A and N.

So let's find a word without R, A, N, ending in E, and with a C in one of positions 2,3,4.

How about ""PLACE"": P, L, A, C, E -> but A is absent? We cannot use A.

How about ""SPICE"": S, P, I, C, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E. That seems good because S, P, I are new letters and we are testing C at position 4.

Alternatively, we could try ""SPACE"": S, P, A, C, E -> but A is absent so we shouldn't use A.

Another word: ""SLICE"": S, L, I, C, E -> avoids R, A, N.

Or ""SHICE"" - not valid? SHICE is not a word. 

Valid words: 
- SLICE: yes, a valid word.
- OPINE: O, P, I, N, E -> but N is absent? Cannot use N.
- Since we cannot use N, avoid it.

So SLICE might work: S, L, I, C, E.

But wait, in SLICE, we are putting C in position 4. Could we put C in position 2? Like ""SCALE"": S, C, A, L, E -> A is absent, not allowed.

Or ""SCOPE"": S, C, O, P, E -> O? not tried, P? not tried. E? at the end. What about the O? But SCOPE has O: so valid and without forbidden letters? Yes, because A, R, N are absent. O is new? Yes.

But we are trying C in position 2? In the first guess, C was tried in position 1 and got a dash. Now we try C in position 2: that'd be fine? But what if C is actually in position 3? We don't know. So either we try a word that moves the C to get more information.

But note: we know C is not in position 1, so positions 2,3,4 are possible. We can try a word that tests position 2? Or leave C out? We cannot leave C out because we are testing other letters? Actually, we must include the fact that C is present? No: we can guess without C? But why? We want to maximize information.

We can consider that the word must have C? So we should include C? Alternatively, we can test other letters without C? But we know C is present? Yes, absolutely: the dash in feedback for C means that at least one C is in the word. Therefore, we can use C again to try to pin down its position.

But note: we are only allowed to use valid words. So we must test letters we haven't tried? That's the idea? To use words that have many new letters? And try to see if they are present or absent? 

So for the second guess:

Option 1: include C and end with E, while testing three new positions (1,2,3) and having C in position 4 (like ""SPICE"", ""SLICE"", etc.)

Option 2: have C in position 2? Then the word must be S C ? ? E.

Possible words: ""SCOPE"" (S C O P E) which avoids R, A, N? Let's see: no A, no R, no N? Yes. O is not forbidden because we have not gotten feedback on O. Similarly, P wasn't tried.

Another: ""SCENE"" -> but N is absent? Cannot use. ""SCORE"" -> R is absent and O? R absent -> no. So ""SCOPE"" seems valid.

Or ""SCALE"": forbidden A -> no. ""SCUTE"" - not valid.

So between ""SCOPE"" (with C in position 2) and ""SLICE"" (with C in position 4). Which one? Both are valid.

Alternatively, we could put C in position 3? Like ""USICE"" -> not valid. Or ""EDUCE"": E D U C E -> but we are ending with E? Yes. Positions: 1:E, 2:D, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E. But we didn't try E elsewhere? We are putting E at position 1 and 5. The secret has E at position 5, but we don't know about position 1. However, we are not forbidden to try E elsewhere? Actually, we can. E could be in other positions? But note: in the feedback, E was only marked at position 5, so if we put E at position 1 and get a dash or nothing, that would tell us if there's another E. Or put E in position 1? It might be tricky.

But we have 6 tries, so we can test.

Another idea: use a word that has multiple E's? For example, ""EXILE"": E X I L E -> ends with E, as required. Then positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E. Then we would find out about E at position 1? But X is a low-frequency letter? Might not give much information.

So perhaps stick to common letters.

I think ""SCOPE"" and ""SLICE"" are both good options. But let me note that in ""SCOPE"", we put C in position 2. If we get C marked correct at position 2, we know it's correct; if dash, then C must be in 3 or 4? Actually, if C is in the word and not at position 2, then we would get a dash meaning it's present elsewhere? But we have position 1 as S? 

Alternatively, ""SLICE"": L in position 2? Then C in position 4.

Since we know C is present and not at position 1, I want to try a word with C in position 2? That is ""SCOPE"".

Or ""PRICE"", but R absent? Avoided.

So let me choose ""SCOPE"".

SCOPE: 
- Position 1: S -> might be? Not tested.
- Position 2: C -> if this is the correct position, we get ✓ for C? Otherwise, if C is at position 3 or 4, then we get a dash for position 2? Because C is in the word but not here? Then what? 

Actually, if we put C at position 2, and the secret word has C at position 4? Then we would get: 
- Position 1: S -> if S is absent? x? Or present? dash? 
- Position 2: C -> since C is actually at position 4, we would get a dash? Because C is in the word but here at location 2.
- Then position 3: O? might be absent?
- Position 4: P? then if P is present? but at position 4? 
This might not reveal much? 

Alternatively, a word that does not have C? Why? That could tell us that? We don't need because we know C is present? So we must include C? Because otherwise we might miss? Actually, no: we know C is present? So we can choose to put C in a different position? 

Actually, the best practice is to put letters we know are present in all subsequent guesses? So we must include C? And E at the end.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLICE"":

SLICE: L is at position 2? Then C at position 4? Then we test S in position 1? And L, I, and then E? 

But note: we already tested E? So only S? is new? Then we test S? 

Alternatively, we can try ""CHIME"": C H I M E -> ends with E? Yes. Then put C at position 1? But we know that C is not at position 1? So that would give a dash for position 1? Because C is in the word elsewhere? So same as using C again? 

But ""CHIME"": positions? C at 1 (which is wrong, so expected dash), H, I, M, E? Then we don't learn much? 

So why SLICE? Actually, let me try to choose ""SPICE"" to check S, P, I? 

But I think any valid word that ends in E and contains C (in positions 2,3,4) and avoids R, A, N is good.

To maximize information: we want to test at least two positions for C? Actually, we can't? In one guess we can test only one position. So I prefer ""SCOPE"" to test C at position 2? 

But note: ""SCOPE"" uses O? Which is less common than other letters? 

How about ""SLICE"": S, L, I, C, E -> all letters are good? 

We can also consider ""BEICE"" -> not valid. 

Valid common words: 
- PIECE: P,I,E,C,E -> but we have E in position 3? Then we have two E's? Positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E -> but position 3 and 5? Then we have E? We know E is at position 5? But position 3? We don't know? And C is at position 4? 

But PIECE is valid? Let me use PIECE? Actually, PIECE is 5 letter word? Yes. But let me spell: P-I-E-C-E. So positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E. 

Then we would test P? and I? and E at position 3? Then C at position 4? 

Since we know the secret ends with E? If there's two E's? Then PIECE testing? 

But why PIECE? 

Alternatively, ""SINCE"": S I N C E -> but N forbidden? Cannot.

""SWIFE"" - not valid? 

Better: ""SPIKE""? S P I K E -> ends with E? Yes. But does not contain C? But we know C is present? Why not include C? 

Therefore, we must include C? So must include C? So SPIKE doesn't include C? Then missed opportunity? 

We know C exists? So we should include it? Even if we don't cover more letters? 

No: we want to test C along with other letters? 

We have to use C? Because we have 6 guesses? And we must keep including confirmed letters? 

But C is confirmed? 

So to move forward: 

I think we should use a word that tests the positions for C? 

Also, we don't know which positions? So we can try a common word that places C in a different position? 

Let's pick ""SLICE"": 

Guess: SLICE 

Response format will tell us S at position 1? L at position 2? I at position 3? C at position 4? 

If the secret word has C at position 4? Then we get ✓ for C? Or elsewhere? Dash? 

Alternatively, we pick ""SHINE"" - doesn't have C? Avoid.

No, must include C? 

Therefore, I choose SLICE? Or SCOPE? 

Let me check: SCOPE (C at position 2) vs SLICE (C at position 4). 

But we can also consider ""CLOSE"": C, L, O, S, E -> ends with E? Yes. Avoids R,A,N? S and L, O? Then C at position 1? But we know C is not at position 1? So putting C at position 1 again? That's going to give a dash? Which is known? So we waste one letter? 

But we test O, S, L? 

So CLOSE: positions 1:C (will yield dash since not 1), L, O, S, E? 

Then it tests L, O, S? 

But E? We know? So it tests three letters? 

But what if the secret word has C at position 2? Then our L? and O? 

But we won't learn? 

Actually, I think ""CLOSE"" is acceptable? Because we test L, O, S? 

But the feedback: for position 1? C will be dash? Meaning again C is elsewhere? Then we don't get new information on C? 

Whereas if we put C in a new position? That could give new information? 

So I prefer to put C in a different position? 

So ""SLICE"": S at position 1, L at position 2, I at position 3, C at position 4, E at position 5. 

Then I'll go with that? 

Or another: ""SPICE"" 

I'll choose ""SPICE"". 

Why SPICE? It uses S, P, I, C, E? P is common too? 

We haven't tested these letters? Good.

Therefore, I decide: SPICE 

So the guess is SPICE.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- E is in the correct position (5th letter), so the secret word ends with E.
- C is present in the word but not in position 1, as indicated by ""-"". So C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- R, A, and N are not in the word, as shown by ""x"" for the other letters.

For the second guess:
- Must end with E to match the known position.
- Must include C, since it is confirmed to be in the word, but avoid positions where we know it doesn't belong (position 1).
- Cannot include R, A, or N, as they are absent.
- Aim to test new common letters in other positions for maximum information gain.

The word ""SPICE"" fits these criteria:
- Ends with E: position 5 is E.
- Places C in position 4: testing a new position for C (previously tried in position 1).
- Uses new letters S, P, I: these are untested and common, helping to reveal their presence/absence.
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N).

This guess efficiently targets possible positions for C while providing information on other high-frequency letters.",Guess 2: SPICE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) C(-) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,EMCEE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to start with a word that has common letters and potentially covers multiple common letters in one go.
 A common strategy is to choose a word with five of the most common letters in English words. Let's pick ""SLATE"" because it has S, L, A, T, E which are very common.I have no prior feedback since this is the first guess. To maximize information gain, I should choose a word that includes common English letters and has a balanced letter distribution. ""CRANE"" is an effective starting word because it contains frequently used letters like C, R, A, N, and E, increasing the likelihood of hitting letters in the target word or revealing their absence. This will provide useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
 C(-)   R(x)   A(x)   N(x)   E(✓)

Interpretation:
- E is in the correct position (5th letter). So the secret word ends with E.
- C is in the word but not in the first position. Therefore, C is somewhere else in the word (positions 2, 3, or 4).
- R, A, N are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word ends with E: ___ E
- The word contains C, but not in position 1 (since C was guessed in position 1 and got ""-"", meaning it's elsewhere).
- R, A, N are absent.

Since R, A, N are absent, we should avoid these letters in future guesses.

For a new guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending with E because position 5 is E (from feedback).
- The word should contain C (since we know C is in the word) but not in the first position? Actually, we can't put C in position 1 because in the feedback, C was in position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning that while C is in the word, it's not in position 1. Therefore, C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
  But note: the word has C, and it is not in position 1 because we got a ""-"" for position 1. Also, since position 5 is E, C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Additionally, we must exclude R, A, N.

We are on the second guess. We want to use the information we have: the word has the letter C (not in position 1) and ends with E.

We can consider words that start with a letter we haven't tried yet (like S, T, etc.) and have C in positions 2, 3, or 4, and end with E.

How about ""SPICE""?
- S: new letter
- P: new letter
- I: new letter
- C: we are testing C in the 4th position (since in CRANE it was in position 1 and wrong, so now try a different position).
- E: at the end, which is fixed.

But note: in ""CRANE"", we got that E is correct at position 5, so any guess must have E in the 5th position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in the second position? Like ""SCONE""? But S, C, O, N, E. But we know N is absent (from previous feedback: N(x)), so we cannot use N.

We cannot use letters that were marked absent: R, A, N.

Let me list the constraints:
- Position 5: E
- Letters present: C (in position 2, 3, or 4)
- Letters not present: R, A, N

We can also consider that the word has exactly the E and the C, and then three other letters? But we don't know how many more.

Our next guess should aim to test multiple possibilities.

A word ending with E that has C in either position 2, 3, or 4 and doesn't contain R, A, N.

Let's think of words that end with E and have a C:

Possible words:
- With C in position 2: ...? Like SC _ _ E. E.g., ""SCENE"", ""SCOPE"", ""SCARE"", but we cannot use A (because A is absent) and R is absent. So ""SCENE"": S, C, E, N, E -> but N is absent and E in the third position? But we already know position 5 is E.

""SCENE"": S, C, E, N, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:E, 4:N, 5:E. But N is absent so we cannot use it. Also, E in position 3? We don't know about E elsewhere.

Actually, we only know about position 5 being E. E could appear elsewhere? But the feedback for E in ""CRANE"" was only position 5 having E, so that E elsewhere might be present or not? The feedback symbol only tells about the position we put it. Since we put E only in position 5, we don't know if E appears elsewhere? However, note that if E appeared elsewhere, we would have seen another symbol? But in the feedback, we only got one E marked as correct (position 5). The other letters were C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x). So there was no E in the word elsewhere? Actually, the feedback doesn't show multiple marks for a letter if it appears multiple times? Therefore, we must be cautious.

In Wordle rules: if a letter appears multiple times in the secret, and you guess it multiple times, each occurrence is evaluated separately. But if you guess a letter once and it appears multiple times, the feedback might only mark the correct/incorrect occurrences accordingly? Actually, no: the feedback is per position. So let us be precise:

In ""CRANE"":
- Position 1: C -> marked with dash (-), meaning C is in the word but not in position 1. It doesn't tell us how many times C appears, only that at least one C is in the word (but not at position 1).

Similarly, E at position 5 is marked as correct (✓) meaning that E is in the word at position 5. But it doesn't tell us if E appears elsewhere? Actually, the absence of an E mark elsewhere doesn't tell, because we didn't put E elsewhere.

So we know:
- The word has a E at position 5.
- The word has at least one C, but not at position 1.

Now for the guess, we are forced to end with E.

Another possibility: ""PRICE"" -> P, R, I, C, E. But we cannot use R because R is absent (from feedback: R(x)). So avoid R.

Similarly, avoid A and N.

So let's find a word without R, A, N, ending in E, and with a C in one of positions 2,3,4.

How about ""PLACE"": P, L, A, C, E -> but A is absent? We cannot use A.

How about ""SPICE"": S, P, I, C, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E. That seems good because S, P, I are new letters and we are testing C at position 4.

Alternatively, we could try ""SPACE"": S, P, A, C, E -> but A is absent so we shouldn't use A.

Another word: ""SLICE"": S, L, I, C, E -> avoids R, A, N.

Or ""SHICE"" - not valid? SHICE is not a word. 

Valid words: 
- SLICE: yes, a valid word.
- OPINE: O, P, I, N, E -> but N is absent? Cannot use N.
- Since we cannot use N, avoid it.

So SLICE might work: S, L, I, C, E.

But wait, in SLICE, we are putting C in position 4. Could we put C in position 2? Like ""SCALE"": S, C, A, L, E -> A is absent, not allowed.

Or ""SCOPE"": S, C, O, P, E -> O? not tried, P? not tried. E? at the end. What about the O? But SCOPE has O: so valid and without forbidden letters? Yes, because A, R, N are absent. O is new? Yes.

But we are trying C in position 2? In the first guess, C was tried in position 1 and got a dash. Now we try C in position 2: that'd be fine? But what if C is actually in position 3? We don't know. So either we try a word that moves the C to get more information.

But note: we know C is not in position 1, so positions 2,3,4 are possible. We can try a word that tests position 2? Or leave C out? We cannot leave C out because we are testing other letters? Actually, we must include the fact that C is present? No: we can guess without C? But why? We want to maximize information.

We can consider that the word must have C? So we should include C? Alternatively, we can test other letters without C? But we know C is present? Yes, absolutely: the dash in feedback for C means that at least one C is in the word. Therefore, we can use C again to try to pin down its position.

But note: we are only allowed to use valid words. So we must test letters we haven't tried? That's the idea? To use words that have many new letters? And try to see if they are present or absent? 

So for the second guess:

Option 1: include C and end with E, while testing three new positions (1,2,3) and having C in position 4 (like ""SPICE"", ""SLICE"", etc.)

Option 2: have C in position 2? Then the word must be S C ? ? E.

Possible words: ""SCOPE"" (S C O P E) which avoids R, A, N? Let's see: no A, no R, no N? Yes. O is not forbidden because we have not gotten feedback on O. Similarly, P wasn't tried.

Another: ""SCENE"" -> but N is absent? Cannot use. ""SCORE"" -> R is absent and O? R absent -> no. So ""SCOPE"" seems valid.

Or ""SCALE"": forbidden A -> no. ""SCUTE"" - not valid.

So between ""SCOPE"" (with C in position 2) and ""SLICE"" (with C in position 4). Which one? Both are valid.

Alternatively, we could put C in position 3? Like ""USICE"" -> not valid. Or ""EDUCE"": E D U C E -> but we are ending with E? Yes. Positions: 1:E, 2:D, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E. But we didn't try E elsewhere? We are putting E at position 1 and 5. The secret has E at position 5, but we don't know about position 1. However, we are not forbidden to try E elsewhere? Actually, we can. E could be in other positions? But note: in the feedback, E was only marked at position 5, so if we put E at position 1 and get a dash or nothing, that would tell us if there's another E. Or put E in position 1? It might be tricky.

But we have 6 tries, so we can test.

Another idea: use a word that has multiple E's? For example, ""EXILE"": E X I L E -> ends with E, as required. Then positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E. Then we would find out about E at position 1? But X is a low-frequency letter? Might not give much information.

So perhaps stick to common letters.

I think ""SCOPE"" and ""SLICE"" are both good options. But let me note that in ""SCOPE"", we put C in position 2. If we get C marked correct at position 2, we know it's correct; if dash, then C must be in 3 or 4? Actually, if C is in the word and not at position 2, then we would get a dash meaning it's present elsewhere? But we have position 1 as S? 

Alternatively, ""SLICE"": L in position 2? Then C in position 4.

Since we know C is present and not at position 1, I want to try a word with C in position 2? That is ""SCOPE"".

Or ""PRICE"", but R absent? Avoided.

So let me choose ""SCOPE"".

SCOPE: 
- Position 1: S -> might be? Not tested.
- Position 2: C -> if this is the correct position, we get ✓ for C? Otherwise, if C is at position 3 or 4, then we get a dash for position 2? Because C is in the word but not here? Then what? 

Actually, if we put C at position 2, and the secret word has C at position 4? Then we would get: 
- Position 1: S -> if S is absent? x? Or present? dash? 
- Position 2: C -> since C is actually at position 4, we would get a dash? Because C is in the word but here at location 2.
- Then position 3: O? might be absent?
- Position 4: P? then if P is present? but at position 4? 
This might not reveal much? 

Alternatively, a word that does not have C? Why? That could tell us that? We don't need because we know C is present? So we must include C? Because otherwise we might miss? Actually, no: we know C is present? So we can choose to put C in a different position? 

Actually, the best practice is to put letters we know are present in all subsequent guesses? So we must include C? And E at the end.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLICE"":

SLICE: L is at position 2? Then C at position 4? Then we test S in position 1? And L, I, and then E? 

But note: we already tested E? So only S? is new? Then we test S? 

Alternatively, we can try ""CHIME"": C H I M E -> ends with E? Yes. Then put C at position 1? But we know that C is not at position 1? So that would give a dash for position 1? Because C is in the word elsewhere? So same as using C again? 

But ""CHIME"": positions? C at 1 (which is wrong, so expected dash), H, I, M, E? Then we don't learn much? 

So why SLICE? Actually, let me try to choose ""SPICE"" to check S, P, I? 

But I think any valid word that ends in E and contains C (in positions 2,3,4) and avoids R, A, N is good.

To maximize information: we want to test at least two positions for C? Actually, we can't? In one guess we can test only one position. So I prefer ""SCOPE"" to test C at position 2? 

But note: ""SCOPE"" uses O? Which is less common than other letters? 

How about ""SLICE"": S, L, I, C, E -> all letters are good? 

We can also consider ""BEICE"" -> not valid. 

Valid common words: 
- PIECE: P,I,E,C,E -> but we have E in position 3? Then we have two E's? Positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E -> but position 3 and 5? Then we have E? We know E is at position 5? But position 3? We don't know? And C is at position 4? 

But PIECE is valid? Let me use PIECE? Actually, PIECE is 5 letter word? Yes. But let me spell: P-I-E-C-E. So positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E. 

Then we would test P? and I? and E at position 3? Then C at position 4? 

Since we know the secret ends with E? If there's two E's? Then PIECE testing? 

But why PIECE? 

Alternatively, ""SINCE"": S I N C E -> but N forbidden? Cannot.

""SWIFE"" - not valid? 

Better: ""SPIKE""? S P I K E -> ends with E? Yes. But does not contain C? But we know C is present? Why not include C? 

Therefore, we must include C? So must include C? So SPIKE doesn't include C? Then missed opportunity? 

We know C exists? So we should include it? Even if we don't cover more letters? 

No: we want to test C along with other letters? 

We have to use C? Because we have 6 guesses? And we must keep including confirmed letters? 

But C is confirmed? 

So to move forward: 

I think we should use a word that tests the positions for C? 

Also, we don't know which positions? So we can try a common word that places C in a different position? 

Let's pick ""SLICE"": 

Guess: SLICE 

Response format will tell us S at position 1? L at position 2? I at position 3? C at position 4? 

If the secret word has C at position 4? Then we get ✓ for C? Or elsewhere? Dash? 

Alternatively, we pick ""SHINE"" - doesn't have C? Avoid.

No, must include C? 

Therefore, I choose SLICE? Or SCOPE? 

Let me check: SCOPE (C at position 2) vs SLICE (C at position 4). 

But we can also consider ""CLOSE"": C, L, O, S, E -> ends with E? Yes. Avoids R,A,N? S and L, O? Then C at position 1? But we know C is not at position 1? So putting C at position 1 again? That's going to give a dash? Which is known? So we waste one letter? 

But we test O, S, L? 

So CLOSE: positions 1:C (will yield dash since not 1), L, O, S, E? 

Then it tests L, O, S? 

But E? We know? So it tests three letters? 

But what if the secret word has C at position 2? Then our L? and O? 

But we won't learn? 

Actually, I think ""CLOSE"" is acceptable? Because we test L, O, S? 

But the feedback: for position 1? C will be dash? Meaning again C is elsewhere? Then we don't get new information on C? 

Whereas if we put C in a new position? That could give new information? 

So I prefer to put C in a different position? 

So ""SLICE"": S at position 1, L at position 2, I at position 3, C at position 4, E at position 5. 

Then I'll go with that? 

Or another: ""SPICE"" 

I'll choose ""SPICE"". 

Why SPICE? It uses S, P, I, C, E? P is common too? 

We haven't tested these letters? Good.

Therefore, I decide: SPICE 

So the guess is SPICE.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- E is in the correct position (5th letter), so the secret word ends with E.
- C is present in the word but not in position 1, as indicated by ""-"". So C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- R, A, and N are not in the word, as shown by ""x"" for the other letters.

For the second guess:
- Must end with E to match the known position.
- Must include C, since it is confirmed to be in the word, but avoid positions where we know it doesn't belong (position 1).
- Cannot include R, A, or N, as they are absent.
- Aim to test new common letters in other positions for maximum information gain.

The word ""SPICE"" fits these criteria:
- Ends with E: position 5 is E.
- Places C in position 4: testing a new position for C (previously tried in position 1).
- Uses new letters S, P, I: these are untested and common, helping to reveal their presence/absence.
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N).

This guess efficiently targets possible positions for C while providing information on other high-frequency letters.

Therefore, C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n  But note: the word has C, and it is not in position 1 because we got a ""-"" for position 1. Also, since position 5 is E, C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\nAdditionally, we must exclude R, A, N.\n\nWe are on the second guess. We want to use the information we have: the word has the letter C (not in position 1) and ends with E.\n\nWe can consider words that start with a letter we haven\'t tried yet (like S, T, etc.) and have C in positions 2, 3, or 4, and end with E.\n\nHow about ""SPICE""?\n- S: new letter\n- P: new letter\n- I: new letter\n- C: we are testing C in the 4th position (since in CRANE it was in position 1 and wrong, so now try a different position).\n- E: at the end, which is fixed.\n\nBut note: in ""CRANE"", we got that E is correct at position 5, so any guess must have E in the 5th position.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has C in the second position? Like ""SCONE""? But S, C, O, N, E. But we know N is absent (from previous feedback: N(x)), so we cannot use N.\n\nWe cannot use letters that were marked absent: R, A, N.\n\nLet me list the constraints:\n- Position 5: E\n- Letters present: C (in position 2, 3, or 4)\n- Letters not present: R, A, N\n\nWe can also consider that the word has exactly the E and the C, and then three other letters? But we don\'t know how many more.\n\nOur next guess should aim to test multiple possibilities.\n\nA word ending with E that has C in either position 2, 3, or 4 and doesn\'t contain R, A, N.\n\nLet\'s think of words that end with E and have a C:\n\nPossible words:\n- With C in position 2: ...? Like SC _ _ E. E.g., ""SCENE"", ""SCOPE"", ""SCARE"", but we cannot use A (because A is absent) and R is absent. So ""SCENE"": S, C, E, N, E -> but N is absent and E in the third position? But we already know position 5 is E.\n\n""SCENE"": S, C, E, N, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:E, 4:N, 5:E. But N is absent so we cannot use it. Also, E in position 3? We don\'t know about E elsewhere.\n\nActually, we only know about position 5 being E. E could appear elsewhere? But the feedback for E in ""CRANE"" was only position 5 having E, so that E elsewhere might be present or not? The feedback symbol only tells about the position we put it. Since we put E only in position 5, we don\'t know if E appears elsewhere? However, note that if E appeared elsewhere, we would have seen another symbol? But in the feedback, we only got one E marked as correct (position 5). The other letters were C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x). So there was no E in the word elsewhere? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t show multiple marks for a letter if it appears multiple times? Therefore, we must be cautious.\n\nIn Wordle rules: if a letter appears multiple times in the secret, and you guess it multiple times, each occurrence is evaluated separately. But if you guess a letter once and it appears multiple times, the feedback might only mark the correct/incorrect occurrences accordingly? Actually, no: the feedback is per position. So let us be precise:\n\nIn ""CRANE"":\n- Position 1: C -> marked with dash (-), meaning C is in the word but not in position 1. It doesn\'t tell us how many times C appears, only that at least one C is in the word (but not at position 1).\n\nSimilarly, E at position 5 is marked as correct (✓) meaning that E is in the word at position 5. But it doesn\'t tell us if E appears elsewhere? Actually, the absence of an E mark elsewhere doesn\'t tell, because we didn\'t put E elsewhere.\n\nSo we know:\n- The word has a E at position 5.\n- The word has at least one C, but not at position 1.\n\nNow for the guess, we are forced to end with E.\n\nAnother possibility: ""PRICE"" -> P, R, I, C, E. But we cannot use R because R is absent (from feedback: R(x)). So avoid R.\n\nSimilarly, avoid A and N.\n\nSo let\'s find a word without R, A, N, ending in E, and with a C in one of positions 2,3,4.\n\nHow about ""PLACE"": P, L, A, C, E -> but A is absent? We cannot use A.\n\nHow about ""SPICE"": S, P, I, C, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E. That seems good because S, P, I are new letters and we are testing C at position 4.\n\nAlternatively, we could try ""SPACE"": S, P, A, C, E -> but A is absent so we shouldn\'t use A.\n\nAnother word: ""SLICE"": S, L, I, C, E -> avoids R, A, N.\n\nOr ""SHICE"" - not valid? SHICE is not a word. \n\nValid words: \n- SLICE: yes, a valid word.\n- OPINE: O, P, I, N, E -> but N is absent? Cannot use N.\n- Since we cannot use N, avoid it.\n\nSo SLICE might work: S, L, I, C, E.\n\nBut wait, in SLICE, we are putting C in position 4. Could we put C in position 2? Like ""SCALE"": S, C, A, L, E -> A is absent, not allowed.\n\nOr ""SCOPE"": S, C, O, P, E -> O? not tried, P? not tried. E? at the end. What about the O? But SCOPE has O: so valid and without forbidden letters? Yes, because A, R, N are absent. O is new? Yes.\n\nBut we are trying C in position 2? In the first guess, C was tried in position 1 and got a dash. Now we try C in position 2: that\'d be fine? But what if C is actually in position 3? We don\'t know. So either we try a word that moves the C to get more information.\n\nBut note: we know C is not in position 1, so positions 2,3,4 are possible. We can try a word that tests position 2? Or leave C out? We cannot leave C out because we are testing other letters? Actually, we must include the fact that C is present? No: we can guess without C? But why? We want to maximize information.\n\nWe can consider that the word must have C? So we should include C? Alternatively, we can test other letters without C? But we know C is present? Yes, absolutely: the dash in feedback for C means that at least one C is in the word. Therefore, we can use C again to try to pin down its position.\n\nBut note: we are only allowed to use valid words. So we must test letters we haven\'t tried? That\'s the idea? To use words that have many new letters? And try to see if they are present or absent? \n\nSo for the second guess:\n\nOption 1: include C and end with E, while testing three new positions (1,2,3) and having C in position 4 (like ""SPICE"", ""SLICE"", etc.)\n\nOption 2: have C in position 2? Then the word must be S C ? ? E.\n\nPossible words: ""SCOPE"" (S C O P E) which avoids R, A, N? Let\'s see: no A, no R, no N? Yes. O is not forbidden because we have not gotten feedback on O. Similarly, P wasn\'t tried.\n\nAnother: ""SCENE"" -> but N is absent? Cannot use. ""SCORE"" -> R is absent and O? R absent -> no. So ""SCOPE"" seems valid.\n\nOr ""SCALE"": forbidden A -> no. ""SCUTE"" - not valid.\n\nSo between ""SCOPE"" (with C in position 2) and ""SLICE"" (with C in position 4). Which one? Both are valid.\n\nAlternatively, we could put C in position 3? Like ""USICE"" -> not valid. Or ""EDUCE"": E D U C E -> but we are ending with E? Yes. Positions: 1:E, 2:D, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E. But we didn\'t try E elsewhere? We are putting E at position 1 and 5. The secret has E at position 5, but we don\'t know about position 1. However, we are not forbidden to try E elsewhere? Actually, we can. E could be in other positions? But note: in the feedback, E was only marked at position 5, so if we put E at position 1 and get a dash or nothing, that would tell us if there\'s another E. Or put E in position 1? It might be tricky.\n\nBut we have 6 tries, so we can test.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has multiple E\'s? For example, ""EXILE"": E X I L E -> ends with E, as required. Then positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E. Then we would find out about E at position 1? But X is a low-frequency letter? Might not give much information.\n\nSo perhaps stick to common letters.\n\nI think ""SCOPE"" and ""SLICE"" are both good options. But let me note that in ""SCOPE"", we put C in position 2. If we get C marked correct at position 2, we know it\'s correct; if dash, then C must be in 3 or 4? Actually, if C is in the word and not at position 2, then we would get a dash meaning it\'s present elsewhere? But we have position 1 as S? \n\nAlternatively, ""SLICE"": L in position 2? Then C in position 4.\n\nSince we know C is present and not at position 1, I want to try a word with C in position 2? That is ""SCOPE"".\n\nOr ""PRICE"", but R absent? Avoided.\n\nSo let me choose ""SCOPE"".\n\nSCOPE: \n- Position 1: S -> might be? Not tested.\n- Position 2: C -> if this is the correct position, we get ✓ for C? Otherwise, if C is at position 3 or 4, then we get a dash for position 2? Because C is in the word but not here? Then what? \n\nActually, if we put C at position 2, and the secret word has C at position 4? Then we would get: \n- Position 1: S -> if S is absent? x? Or present? dash? \n- Position 2: C -> since C is actually at position 4, we would get a dash? Because C is in the word but here at location 2.\n- Then position 3: O? might be absent?\n- Position 4: P? then if P is present? but at position 4? \nThis might not reveal much? \n\nAlternatively, a word that does not have C? Why? That could tell us that? We don\'t need because we know C is present? So we must include C? Because otherwise we might miss? Actually, no: we know C is present? So we can choose to put C in a different position? \n\nActually, the best practice is to put letters we know are present in all subsequent guesses? So we must include C? And E at the end.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""SLICE"":\n\nSLICE: L is at position 2? Then C at position 4? Then we test S in position 1? And L, I, and then E? \n\nBut note: we already tested E? So only S? is new? Then we test S? \n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CHIME"": C H I M E -> ends with E? Yes. Then put C at position 1? But we know that C is not at position 1? So that would give a dash for position 1? Because C is in the word elsewhere? So same as using C again? \n\nBut ""CHIME"": positions? C at 1 (which is wrong, so expected dash), H, I, M, E? Then we don\'t learn much? \n\nSo why SLICE? Actually, let me try to choose ""SPICE"" to check S, P, I? \n\nBut I think any valid word that ends in E and contains C (in positions 2,3,4) and avoids R, A, N is good.\n\nTo maximize information: we want to test at least two positions for C? Actually, we can\'t? In one guess we can test only one position. So I prefer ""SCOPE"" to test C at position 2? \n\nBut note: ""SCOPE"" uses O? Which is less common than other letters? \n\nHow about ""SLICE"": S, L, I, C, E -> all letters are good? \n\nWe can also consider ""BEICE"" -> not valid. \n\nValid common words: \n- PIECE: P,I,E,C,E -> but we have E in position 3? Then we have two E\'s? Positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E -> but position 3 and 5? Then we have E? We know E is at position 5? But position 3? We don\'t know? And C is at position 4? \n\nBut PIECE is valid? Let me use PIECE? Actually, PIECE is 5 letter word? Yes. But let me spell: P-I-E-C-E. So positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E. \n\nThen we would test P? and I? and E at position 3? Then C at position 4? \n\nSince we know the secret ends with E? If there\'s two E\'s? Then PIECE testing? \n\nBut why PIECE? \n\nAlternatively, ""SINCE"": S I N C E -> but N forbidden? Cannot.\n\n""SWIFE"" - not valid? \n\nBetter: ""SPIKE""? S P I K E -> ends with E? Yes. But does not contain C? But we know C is present? Why not include C? \n\nTherefore, we must include C? So must include C? So SPIKE doesn\'t include C? Then missed opportunity? \n\nWe know C exists? So we should include it? Even if we don\'t cover more letters? \n\nNo: we want to test C along with other letters? \n\nWe have to use C? Because we have 6 guesses? And we must keep including confirmed letters? \n\nBut C is confirmed? \n\nSo to move forward: \n\nI think we should use a word that tests the positions for C? \n\nAlso, we don\'t know which positions? So we can try a common word that places C in a different position? \n\nLet\'s pick ""SLICE"": \n\nGuess: SLICE \n\nResponse format will tell us S at position 1? L at position 2? I at position 3? C at position 4? \n\nIf the secret word has C at position 4? Then we get ✓ for C? Or elsewhere? Dash? \n\nAlternatively, we pick ""SHINE"" - doesn\'t have C? Avoid.\n\nNo, must include C? \n\nTherefore, I choose SLICE? Or SCOPE? \n\nLet me check: SCOPE (C at position 2) vs SLICE (C at position 4). \n\nBut we can also consider ""CLOSE"": C, L, O, S, E -> ends with E? Yes. Avoids R,A,N? S and L, O? Then C at position 1? But we know C is not at position 1? So putting C at position 1 again? That\'s going to give a dash? Which is known? So we waste one letter? \n\nBut we test O, S, L? \n\nSo CLOSE: positions 1:C (will yield dash since not 1), L, O, S, E? \n\nThen it tests L, O, S? \n\nBut E? We know? So it tests three letters? \n\nBut what if the secret word has C at position 2? Then our L? and O? \n\nBut we won\'t learn? \n\nActually, I think ""CLOSE"" is acceptable? Because we test L, O, S? \n\nBut the feedback: for position 1? C will be dash? Meaning again C is elsewhere? Then we don\'t get new information on C? \n\nWhereas if we put C in a new position? That could give new information? \n\nSo I prefer to put C in a different position? \n\nSo ""SLICE"": S at position 1, L at position 2, I at position 3, C at position 4, E at position 5. \n\nThen I\'ll go with that? \n\nOr another: ""SPICE"" \n\nI\'ll choose ""SPICE"". \n\nWhy SPICE?

We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: dash (-) meaning C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: check (✓) meaning E is in the word and in position 5.

Second guess: SPICE
- S: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- C: dash (-) meaning C is in the word but not in position 4 (since we placed it in position 4 here).
- E: check (✓) meaning E is in position 5 (which we already knew).

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The letter C is in the word, but not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, C must be in position 2 or 3.
3. The following letters are absent: R, A, N, S, P, I. (from the x's in both guesses)

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I. So we should avoid these except for C and E which are present.

Since C must be in position 2 or 3, and we know position 5 is E, we can form a word that has:
- Position 2: C? or Position 3: C?
- Position 5: E
- The other positions: new letters that we haven't tried.

We must avoid R, A, N, S, P, I.

Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending with E, with C in position 2 or 3, and using only the available letters.

Possible positions for C:
Case 1: C in position 2 -> pattern: _ C _ _ E
Case 2: C in position 3 -> pattern: _ _ C _ E

We need to choose a word that tests one of these cases and also tests new letters.

Let's consider case 1: C in position 2. What words fit _ C _ _ E?
Examples: 
- OCEAN? But O is available, but we have A and N absent? A and N are out, so no.
- ICY? Not 5 letters.
- We need 5 letters: _ C _ _ E.

Possible words: 
- ACUTE? But A is absent -> no.
- SCENE? S is absent -> no.
- Since S, P, I, R, A, N are out, we need words without them.

Let me think: 
- Maybe ""OCHRE""? But R is absent -> no.
- ""OCTET""? But T is available? O C T E T -> but ends with T, not E? No, we need E at the end.

Words ending with E: 
- ""DANCE""? But D is available, but A and N are out -> no.
- ""FENCE""? F is available, but E in position 2? F E N C E -> but that has E in position 2? And we don't know about other E's? But also N is out -> no.
- ""FORCE""? F O R C E -> but R is out -> no.
- ""HOUSE""? H O U S E -> S is out -> no.

This is tricky. Let's list possible words without the forbidden letters and ending with E, and C in position 2.

Forbidden: R, A, N, S, P, I.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pattern: _ C _ _ E

Possible:
- ""OCHRE"" has R -> no.
- ""OCTAVE"" has A and is 6 letters -> no.
- ""OCTANE"" has A and N -> no.
- ""CYCLE""? C Y C L E -> but that has C in position 1 and 3? We need C in position 2? Position 1: C, 2: Y, 3: C, 4: L, 5: E -> but we are not allowed to put C in position 1? We know C is not in position 1, so we can't put it there? Actually, we can put it, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there? But in this word, C is in position 1 and 3? But we are trying to test C in position 2? This word doesn't have C in position 2.

We need exactly C in position 2.

Another word: ""ACTED"" -> A is out -> no.

""ECLAT"" -> not ending with E.

Perhaps ""DUCHY"" -> not ending with E.

I'm struggling. Let's consider case 2: C in position 3. Pattern: _ _ C _ E

Then we can have words like:
- A C _ _ E? But A is out.
- B _ C _ E: e.g., ""BICEP""? But I is out -> no.
- D _ C _ E: ""DICE""? But I is out -> no.
- F _ C _ E: ""FORCE""? R out -> no.
- G _ C _ E: ""GLACE""? G L A C E -> A out -> no.
- H _ C _ E: ""HENCE""? H E N C E -> N out -> no.
- L _ C _ E: ""LANCE""? A and N out -> no.
- M _ C _ E: ""MINCE""? I and N out -> no.
- O _ C _ E: ""OUNCE""? O U N C E -> N out -> no.
- T _ C _ E: ""TRACE""? R and A out -> no.
- U _ C _ E: ""UNICE""? U N I C E -> N and I out -> no.
- V _ C _ E: ""VOICE""? V O I C E -> I out -> no.
- W _ C _ E: ""WENCE""? Not common.

This is difficult. Maybe I missed some words.

Another idea: perhaps the word has double letters? But we don't know.

Or maybe C is in position 3: let's think of ""TOUCH"" -> not ending with E.

""BEECH""? B E E C H -> but E in position 2? And we have E at the end? Pattern: B E E C H -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:E, 4:C, 5:H -> not ending with E? No.

""BEIGE"" -> no C.

Perhaps ""C"" in position 3 and the last letter E, so the fourth letter can be various.

Let me list words ending with E and C in position 3:
- ABACE? Not a word.
- DANCE -> A and N out.
- FENCE -> N out.
- Hence -> N out.
- LANCE -> A and N out.
- MINCE -> I and N out.
- ONCE? 4 letters.
- PIECE -> I and P out? P is out? P is absent from second guess.
- PRICE -> P and R out.
- TRACE -> T R A C E -> R and A out.
- VOICE -> V O I C E -> I out.

All have forbidden letters.

But we have to use only available letters. Available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to find a word with pattern _ _ C _ E without forbidden letters.

For example:
- ""OUNCE"" has N -> no.
- ""TOUCE"" not a word.
- ""COUCH"" not ending with E.
- ""DOUCE""? D O U C E -> is that a word? Douce means sweet or pleasant? Yes, it's a valid word. D O U C E.

Letters: D, O, U, C, E. 
- D: not tried? Available.
- O: not tried.
- U: not tried.
- C: we know is present.
- E: known at position 5.

And it avoids R, A, N, S, P, I.

So ""DOUCE"" could be a candidate. Pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E.

But in this word, C is in position 4? But from the second guess, we have C in position 4 and got a dash, meaning C is not in position 4. So we cannot put C in position 4 again? We can, but it would be inefficient? Actually, we know C is not in position 4, so putting it there again would give a dash and not new information.

In ""DOUCE"", C is in position 4, which we already know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

We need to put C in position 2 or 3, not 4.

For pattern _ _ C _ E, position 3 is C, and position 4 is a new letter.

In ""DOUCE"", position 3 is U, position 4 is C? No: D O U C E -> position 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E. So C is in position 4, which is not allowed because we know C is not in position 4.

We need C in position 3 for this pattern? Pattern _ _ C _ E means:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: C
Position 4: ?
Position 5: E

For example, ""TRACE"" has position 3: A? No, T R A C E -> position 3 is A, position 4 is C.

I think I'm confusing the positions.

Let me clarify:
- For a word: positions 1,2,3,4,5.
- Pattern for C in position 3: so position 3 is C, and position 5 is E.
- So the word is: _ _ C _ E

The fourth letter is between C and E.

Examples:
- ""DANCE"": D A N C E -> position 3: N, position 4: C -> not C in position 3.
- ""MINCE"": M I N C E -> position 3: N, position 4: C.
- ""FORCE"": F O R C E -> position 3: R, position 4: C.
- ""BEICE"" not a word.
- ""SAUCE"": S A U C E -> position 3: U, position 4: C.

But S and A are out.

What about ""TOUCE""? Not a word.

""CHICE"" not a word.

""QUICE"" not a word.

""VOICE"": V O I C E -> position 3: I, position 4: C.

I is out.

""GLACE"": G L A C E -> position 3: A, position 4: C. A out.

""OUNCE"": O U N C E -> position 3: N, position 4: C. N out.

""URBAN"" not ending with E.

Perhaps ""OCTANE"" is 6 letters.

Another idea: ""C"" in position 2, pattern: _ C _ _ E

With available letters.

For example:
- ""OCHRE"" has R -> no.
- ""ACHED"" has A -> no.
- ""ECHO"" not 5 letters.
- ""ICILY"" not ending with E.

""UCKLE"" not starting.

""BCE"" not.

Let's think of ""OCTAVE"" too long.

Perhaps ""DECOY"" not ending with E.

I think I need to consider that the word might have C in position 3 and use a word like ""THYME"" but no C.

Another word: ""C"" in position 3: ""DICEY"" not ending with E.

""EXCEL"" E X C E L -> positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:C, 4:E, 5:L -> not ending with E? Ends with L.

But we know position 5 is E, so it must end with E.

""EXILE"" E X I L E -> I and L, but I is out.

""AXILE"" A out.

""DOCLE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""LOCKE"" not common.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words ending with E that have C in position 2 or 3 and use only available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For C in position 2: pattern _ C _ _ E

- ""UCKER"" not and R out.
- ""ACER"" not 5 letters.
- ""ICER"" not 5 letters.
- ""OCEAN"" 5 letters but O C E A N -> position 2:C, but A and N out.
- ""OCREA"" not common.
- ""OCTET"" O C T E T -> ends with T, not E.
- ""OCTAD"" not ending with E.
- ""OCTAL"" not E.
- ""OCTYL"" not E.
- ""OCTIC"" not E.

Perhaps ""OCTAVE"" is 6.

Maybe ""YCLAD"" not.

I think I have to consider C in position 3 with pattern _ _ C _ E.

And the fourth letter must be one of the available letters.

For example:
- ""ABACUS"" not 5.
- ""BACCA"" not E.
- ""CACAO"" not E.
- ""DACHA"" D A C H A -> not E.
- ""FACED"" F A C E D -> not ending with E, and A out.
- ""GECKO"" not E.
- ""HOCUS"" not E.
- ""LACED"" L A C E D -> A out.
- ""MACED"" M A C E D -> A out.
- ""PACED"" P out and A out.
- ""RACED"" R and A out.
- ""VACUUM"" not 5.

But we need the fourth letter to be something, and then E.

Another word: ""OUNCE"" has N.

""TOUCE"" not a word.

""COUPE"" C O U P E -> but P is out, and C is in position 1? Oops, position 1:C, which we know is not.

""COUPE"" is C O U P E, so position 1:C (not allowed), position 4:P (out).

Not good.

""DOUCE"" is D O U C E, but C in position 4, which we know is not.

But we know C is not in position 4, so we should not put it there.

Perhaps we can use a word that has C in position 2 or 3, but I'm struggling to find one.

Another idea: maybe the secret word has two C's? But we don't know.

Or perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have C in position 4, but in position 2 or 3.

Let's try to find words with C in position 2: like ""SCARE"" but S and A out.

""SCORE"" S and R out.

""SCUTE"" S out.

""ECLAT"" not E.

""ICILY"" not E.

""OCEAN"" not.

Perhaps ""YCLAD"" not.

Let's consider C in position 3: ""LYCEE"" L Y C E E -> is that a word? Lycee, yes, a type of school. L Y C E E.

Positions: 1:L, 2:Y, 3:C, 4:E, 5:E.

But position 4 is E, and position 5 is E. We know position 5 is E, but position 4 is also E? That's possible.

Letters: L, Y, C, E, E.

- L: available
- Y: available
- C: present
- E: present at position 5, and we are testing E at position 4? But we know E is at position 5, but it could be elsewhere.

But in the feedback, we only know about position 5 E, not about other positions.

Also, ""LYCEE"" has E in position 4 and 5.

But in the word, position 3 is C, which is what we want.

And it avoids forbidden letters: no R, A, N, S, P, I.

So ""LYCEE"" is a valid guess.

Pattern: _ _ C _ E, with position 3:C, position 5:E.

In ""LYCEE"", position 3 is C, position 4 is E, position 5 is E.

So we can guess ""LYCEE"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has C in position 3, then we get C correct there. If not, we get a dash.

Also, we test L and Y.

Another possibility: ""OUNCE"" but N out.

""ounce"" has N, so no.

""TOUCE"" not a word.

""YOUCE"" not.

So ""LYCEE"" seems like a good option.

But ""LYCEE"" has two E's, which is fine.

We can also consider ""C"" in position 2: but I can't find a word with available letters.

Another word: ""C"" in position 2: ""ACHOO"" not E.

""ECRUS"" not.

I think ""LYCEE"" is our best bet.

So I'll go with ""LYCEE"".

But let's make sure about the spelling: L-Y-C-E-E, yes, it's a valid word.

So guess: LYCEE

In the response, we will see:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: Y
- Position 3: C
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: E (known)

We know position 5 is E, so it will be correct.

Position 4 is E, which might be correct or not? We don't know.

But the main point is to test C in position 3 and get information on L and Y.

If C is in position 3, we get a check; if not, a dash.

Also, if E is in position 4, we get a check or dash.

But since we have two E's, it might be messy, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""OCTAD"" not ending with E.

I think we have to go with it.

So the guess is LYCEE.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  This means:  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - R, A, and N are not in the word.  
  - E is in the word and in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: SPICE → Feedback: S(x) P(x) I(x) C(-) E(✓)**  
  This means:  
  - S, P, and I are not in the word.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - E is confirmed in position 5 (already known).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Position 5 is E**: The word ends with E.  
2. **C is present but position is unknown**:  
   - C is not in position 1 (from CRANE) or position 4 (from SPICE).  
   - Therefore, C must be in position 2 or 3.  
3. **Absent letters**: R, A, N, S, P, I are not in the word. Avoid using these.  
4. **Available letters**: Focus on untried common letters like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test C in position 3**: Since C cannot be in positions 1 or 4, position 3 is a key uncertainty. Position 2 will be tested if position 3 is ruled out later.  
- **Maximize information**: Use a word with C in position 3, E in position 5, and new high-frequency letters in other positions to test for presence/absence.  
- **Avoid wasted letters**: Do not reuse absent letters (R, A, N, S, P, I).  

The word **""LYCEE""** fits perfectly:  
- **L** (position 1): Untried letter.  
- **Y** (position 2): Untried letter.  
- **C** (position 3): Tests C in position 3 (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we get - and know C is in position 2).  
- **E** (position 4): Tests if E appears elsewhere (we only know it's in position 5).  
- **E** (position 5): Confirmed E (will be ✓).  

This guess efficiently narrows down C's position and tests new letters (L, Y) while adhering to constraints.

<guess>LYCEE</guess>",LYCEE,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: dash (-) meaning C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: check (✓) meaning E is in the word and in position 5.

Second guess: SPICE
- S: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- C: dash (-) meaning C is in the word but not in position 4 (since we placed it in position 4 here).
- E: check (✓) meaning E is in position 5 (which we already knew).

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The letter C is in the word, but not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, C must be in position 2 or 3.
3. The following letters are absent: R, A, N, S, P, I. (from the x's in both guesses)

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I. So we should avoid these except for C and E which are present.

Since C must be in position 2 or 3, and we know position 5 is E, we can form a word that has:
- Position 2: C? or Position 3: C?
- Position 5: E
- The other positions: new letters that we haven't tried.

We must avoid R, A, N, S, P, I.

Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending with E, with C in position 2 or 3, and using only the available letters.

Possible positions for C:
Case 1: C in position 2 -> pattern: _ C _ _ E
Case 2: C in position 3 -> pattern: _ _ C _ E

We need to choose a word that tests one of these cases and also tests new letters.

Let's consider case 1: C in position 2. What words fit _ C _ _ E?
Examples: 
- OCEAN? But O is available, but we have A and N absent? A and N are out, so no.
- ICY? Not 5 letters.
- We need 5 letters: _ C _ _ E.

Possible words: 
- ACUTE? But A is absent -> no.
- SCENE? S is absent -> no.
- Since S, P, I, R, A, N are out, we need words without them.

Let me think: 
- Maybe ""OCHRE""? But R is absent -> no.
- ""OCTET""? But T is available? O C T E T -> but ends with T, not E? No, we need E at the end.

Words ending with E: 
- ""DANCE""? But D is available, but A and N are out -> no.
- ""FENCE""? F is available, but E in position 2? F E N C E -> but that has E in position 2? And we don't know about other E's? But also N is out -> no.
- ""FORCE""? F O R C E -> but R is out -> no.
- ""HOUSE""? H O U S E -> S is out -> no.

This is tricky. Let's list possible words without the forbidden letters and ending with E, and C in position 2.

Forbidden: R, A, N, S, P, I.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pattern: _ C _ _ E

Possible:
- ""OCHRE"" has R -> no.
- ""OCTAVE"" has A and is 6 letters -> no.
- ""OCTANE"" has A and N -> no.
- ""CYCLE""? C Y C L E -> but that has C in position 1 and 3? We need C in position 2? Position 1: C, 2: Y, 3: C, 4: L, 5: E -> but we are not allowed to put C in position 1? We know C is not in position 1, so we can't put it there? Actually, we can put it, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there? But in this word, C is in position 1 and 3? But we are trying to test C in position 2? This word doesn't have C in position 2.

We need exactly C in position 2.

Another word: ""ACTED"" -> A is out -> no.

""ECLAT"" -> not ending with E.

Perhaps ""DUCHY"" -> not ending with E.

I'm struggling. Let's consider case 2: C in position 3. Pattern: _ _ C _ E

Then we can have words like:
- A C _ _ E? But A is out.
- B _ C _ E: e.g., ""BICEP""? But I is out -> no.
- D _ C _ E: ""DICE""? But I is out -> no.
- F _ C _ E: ""FORCE""? R out -> no.
- G _ C _ E: ""GLACE""? G L A C E -> A out -> no.
- H _ C _ E: ""HENCE""? H E N C E -> N out -> no.
- L _ C _ E: ""LANCE""? A and N out -> no.
- M _ C _ E: ""MINCE""? I and N out -> no.
- O _ C _ E: ""OUNCE""? O U N C E -> N out -> no.
- T _ C _ E: ""TRACE""? R and A out -> no.
- U _ C _ E: ""UNICE""? U N I C E -> N and I out -> no.
- V _ C _ E: ""VOICE""? V O I C E -> I out -> no.
- W _ C _ E: ""WENCE""? Not common.

This is difficult. Maybe I missed some words.

Another idea: perhaps the word has double letters? But we don't know.

Or maybe C is in position 3: let's think of ""TOUCH"" -> not ending with E.

""BEECH""? B E E C H -> but E in position 2? And we have E at the end? Pattern: B E E C H -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:E, 4:C, 5:H -> not ending with E? No.

""BEIGE"" -> no C.

Perhaps ""C"" in position 3 and the last letter E, so the fourth letter can be various.

Let me list words ending with E and C in position 3:
- ABACE? Not a word.
- DANCE -> A and N out.
- FENCE -> N out.
- Hence -> N out.
- LANCE -> A and N out.
- MINCE -> I and N out.
- ONCE? 4 letters.
- PIECE -> I and P out? P is out? P is absent from second guess.
- PRICE -> P and R out.
- TRACE -> T R A C E -> R and A out.
- VOICE -> V O I C E -> I out.

All have forbidden letters.

But we have to use only available letters. Available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to find a word with pattern _ _ C _ E without forbidden letters.

- ""TOUCE"" not a word.
- ""COUCH"" not ending with E.
- ""DOUCE""? D O U C E -> is that a word? Douce means sweet or pleasant? Yes, it's a valid word. D O U C E.

Letters: D, O, U, C, E. 
- D: not tried? Available.
- O: not tried.
- U: not tried.
- C: we know is present.
- E: known at position 5.

And it avoids R, A, N, S, P, I.

So ""DOUCE"" could be a candidate. Pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E.

But in this word, C is in position 4? But from the second guess, we have C in position 4 and got a dash, meaning C is not in position 4. So we cannot put C in position 4 again? We can, but it would be inefficient? Actually, we know C is not in position 4, so putting it there again would give a dash and not new information.

We need to put C in position 2 or 3, not 4.

For pattern _ _ C _ E, position 3 is C, and position 4 is a new letter.

In ""DOUCE"", position 3 is U, position 4 is C? No: D O U C E -> position 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E. So C is in position 4, which is not allowed because we know C is not in position 4.

We need C in position 3 for this pattern? Pattern _ _ C _ E means:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: C
Position 4: ?
Position 5: E

For example, ""TRACE"" has position 3: A? No, T R A C E -> position 3 is A, position 4 is C.

But S and A are out.

What about ""TOUCE""? Not a word.

""CHICE"" not a word.

""QUICE"" not a word.

""VOICE"": V O I C E -> position 3: I, position 4: C.

I is out.

""GLACE"": G L A C E -> position 3: A, position 4: C. A out.

""OUNCE"": O U N C E -> position 3: N, position 4: C. N out.

""URBAN"" not ending with E.

Perhaps ""OCTANE"" is 6 letters.

Another idea: ""C"" in position 2, pattern: _ C _ _ E

""EXCEL"" E X C E L -> positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:C, 4:E, 5:L -> not ending with E? Ends with L.

But we know position 5 is E, so it must end with E.

""EXILE"" E X I L E -> I and L, but I is out.

""AXILE"" A out.

""DOCLE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""LOCKE"" not common.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words ending with E that have C in position 2 or 3 and use only available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For C in position 2: pattern _ C _ _ E

- ""UCKER"" not and R out.
- ""ACER"" not 5 letters.

- ""VACUUM"" not 5.

But we need the fourth letter to be something, and then E.

Another word: ""OUNCE"" has N.

""TOUCE"" not a word.

""COUPE"" C O U P E -> but P is out, and C is in position 1? Oops, position 1:C, which we know is not.

""COUPE"" is C O U P E, so position 1:C (not allowed), position 4:P (out).

Not good.

""DOUCE"" is D O U C E, but C in position 4, which we know is not.

But we know C is not in position 4, so we should not put it there.

Perhaps we can use a word that has C in position 2 or 3, but I'm struggling to find one.

Perhaps ""YCLAD"" not.

Let's consider C in position 3: ""LYCEE"" L Y C E E -> is that a word? Lycee, yes, a type of school. L Y C E E.

Positions: 1:L, 2:Y, 3:C, 4:E, 5:E.

But position 4 is E, and position 5 is E. We know position 5 is E, but position 4 is also E? That's possible.

Letters: L, Y, C, E, E.

- L: available
- Y: available
- C: present
- E: present at position 5, and we are testing E at position 4? But we know E is at position 5, but it could be elsewhere.

But in the feedback, we only know about position 5 E, not about other positions.

Also, ""LYCEE"" has E in position 4 and 5.

But in the word, position 3 is C, which is what we want.

And it avoids forbidden letters: no R, A, N, S, P, I.

So ""LYCEE"" is a valid guess.

Pattern: _ _ C _ E, with position 3:C, position 5:E.

In ""LYCEE"", position 3 is C, position 4 is E, position 5 is E.

So we can guess ""LYCEE"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has C in position 3, then we get C correct there. If not, we get a dash.

Also, we test L and Y.

Another possibility: ""OUNCE"" but N out.

""ounce"" has N, so no.

""TOUCE"" not a word.

""YOUCE"" not.

So ""LYCEE"" seems like a good option.

But ""LYCEE"" has two E's, which is fine.

We can also consider ""C"" in position 2: but I can't find a word with available letters.

Another word: ""C"" in position 2: ""ACHOO"" not E.

""ECRUS"" not.

I think ""LYCEE"" is our best bet.

So I'll go with ""LYCEE"".

But let's make sure about the spelling: L-Y-C-E-E, yes, it's a valid word.

So guess: LYCEE

In the response, we will see:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: Y
- Position 3: C
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: E (known)

We know position 5 is E, so it will be correct.

Position 4 is E, which might be correct or not? We don't know.

But the main point is to test C in position 3 and get information on L and Y.

If C is in position 3, we get a check; if not, a dash.

Also, if E is in position 4, we get a check or dash.

But since we have two E's, it might be messy, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""OCTAD"" not ending with E.

I think we have to go with it.

So the guess is LYCEE.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  This means:  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - R, A, and N are not in the word.  
  - E is in the word and in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: SPICE → Feedback: S(x) P(x) I(x) C(-) E(✓)**  
  This means:  
  - S, P, and I are not in the word.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - E is confirmed in position 5 (already known).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Position 5 is E**: The word ends with E.  
2. **C is present but position is unknown**:  
   - C is not in position 1 (from CRANE) or position 4 (from SPICE).  
   - Therefore, C must be in position 2 or 3.  
3. **Absent letters**: R, A, N, S, P, I are not in the word. Avoid using these.  
4. **Available letters**: Focus on untried common letters like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test C in position 3**: Since C cannot be in positions 1 or 4, position 3 is a key uncertainty. Position 2 will be tested if position 3 is ruled out later.  
- **Maximize information**: Use a word with C in position 3, E in position 5, and new high-frequency letters in other positions to test for presence/absence.  
- **Avoid wasted letters**: Do not reuse absent letters (R, A, N, S, P, I).  

The word **""LYCEE""** fits perfectly:  
- **L** (position 1): Untried letter.  
- **Y** (position 2): Untried letter.  
- **C** (position 3): Tests C in position 3 (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we get - and know C is in position 2).  
- **E** (position 4): Tests if E appears elsewhere (we only know it's in position 5).  
- **E** (position 5): Confirmed E (will be ✓).  

This guess efficiently narrows down C's position and tests new letters (L, Y) while adhering to constraints.",Guess 3: LYCEE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) Y(x) C(✓) E(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,EMCEE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to start with a word that has common letters and potentially covers multiple common letters in one go.
 A common strategy is to choose a word with five of the most common letters in English words. Let's pick ""SLATE"" because it has S, L, A, T, E which are very common.I have no prior feedback since this is the first guess. To maximize information gain, I should choose a word that includes common English letters and has a balanced letter distribution. ""CRANE"" is an effective starting word because it contains frequently used letters like C, R, A, N, and E, increasing the likelihood of hitting letters in the target word or revealing their absence. This will provide useful feedback for subsequent guesses.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
 C(-)   R(x)   A(x)   N(x)   E(✓)

Interpretation:
- E is in the correct position (5th letter). So the secret word ends with E.
- C is in the word but not in the first position. Therefore, C is somewhere else in the word (positions 2, 3, or 4).
- R, A, N are not in the word at all.

So we know:
- The word ends with E: ___ E
- The word contains C, but not in position 1 (since C was guessed in position 1 and got ""-"", meaning it's elsewhere).
- R, A, N are absent.

Since R, A, N are absent, we should avoid these letters in future guesses.

For a new guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word ending with E because position 5 is E (from feedback).
- The word should contain C (since we know C is in the word) but not in the first position? Actually, we can't put C in position 1 because in the feedback, C was in position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning that while C is in the word, it's not in position 1. Therefore, C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.
  But note: the word has C, and it is not in position 1 because we got a ""-"" for position 1. Also, since position 5 is E, C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

Additionally, we must exclude R, A, N.

We are on the second guess. We want to use the information we have: the word has the letter C (not in position 1) and ends with E.

We can consider words that start with a letter we haven't tried yet (like S, T, etc.) and have C in positions 2, 3, or 4, and end with E.

How about ""SPICE""?
- S: new letter
- P: new letter
- I: new letter
- C: we are testing C in the 4th position (since in CRANE it was in position 1 and wrong, so now try a different position).
- E: at the end, which is fixed.

But note: in ""CRANE"", we got that E is correct at position 5, so any guess must have E in the 5th position.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has C in the second position? Like ""SCONE""? But S, C, O, N, E. But we know N is absent (from previous feedback: N(x)), so we cannot use N.

We cannot use letters that were marked absent: R, A, N.

Let me list the constraints:
- Position 5: E
- Letters present: C (in position 2, 3, or 4)
- Letters not present: R, A, N

We can also consider that the word has exactly the E and the C, and then three other letters? But we don't know how many more.

Our next guess should aim to test multiple possibilities.

A word ending with E that has C in either position 2, 3, or 4 and doesn't contain R, A, N.

Let's think of words that end with E and have a C:

Possible words:
- With C in position 2: ...? Like SC _ _ E. E.g., ""SCENE"", ""SCOPE"", ""SCARE"", but we cannot use A (because A is absent) and R is absent. So ""SCENE"": S, C, E, N, E -> but N is absent and E in the third position? But we already know position 5 is E.

""SCENE"": S, C, E, N, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:E, 4:N, 5:E. But N is absent so we cannot use it. Also, E in position 3? We don't know about E elsewhere.

Actually, we only know about position 5 being E. E could appear elsewhere? But the feedback for E in ""CRANE"" was only position 5 having E, so that E elsewhere might be present or not? The feedback symbol only tells about the position we put it. Since we put E only in position 5, we don't know if E appears elsewhere? However, note that if E appeared elsewhere, we would have seen another symbol? But in the feedback, we only got one E marked as correct (position 5). The other letters were C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x). So there was no E in the word elsewhere? Actually, the feedback doesn't show multiple marks for a letter if it appears multiple times? Therefore, we must be cautious.

In Wordle rules: if a letter appears multiple times in the secret, and you guess it multiple times, each occurrence is evaluated separately. But if you guess a letter once and it appears multiple times, the feedback might only mark the correct/incorrect occurrences accordingly? Actually, no: the feedback is per position. So let us be precise:

In ""CRANE"":
- Position 1: C -> marked with dash (-), meaning C is in the word but not in position 1. It doesn't tell us how many times C appears, only that at least one C is in the word (but not at position 1).

Similarly, E at position 5 is marked as correct (✓) meaning that E is in the word at position 5. But it doesn't tell us if E appears elsewhere? Actually, the absence of an E mark elsewhere doesn't tell, because we didn't put E elsewhere.

So we know:
- The word has a E at position 5.
- The word has at least one C, but not at position 1.

Now for the guess, we are forced to end with E.

Another possibility: ""PRICE"" -> P, R, I, C, E. But we cannot use R because R is absent (from feedback: R(x)). So avoid R.

Similarly, avoid A and N.

So let's find a word without R, A, N, ending in E, and with a C in one of positions 2,3,4.

How about ""PLACE"": P, L, A, C, E -> but A is absent? We cannot use A.

How about ""SPICE"": S, P, I, C, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E. That seems good because S, P, I are new letters and we are testing C at position 4.

Alternatively, we could try ""SPACE"": S, P, A, C, E -> but A is absent so we shouldn't use A.

Another word: ""SLICE"": S, L, I, C, E -> avoids R, A, N.

Or ""SHICE"" - not valid? SHICE is not a word. 

Valid words: 
- SLICE: yes, a valid word.
- OPINE: O, P, I, N, E -> but N is absent? Cannot use N.
- Since we cannot use N, avoid it.

So SLICE might work: S, L, I, C, E.

But wait, in SLICE, we are putting C in position 4. Could we put C in position 2? Like ""SCALE"": S, C, A, L, E -> A is absent, not allowed.

Or ""SCOPE"": S, C, O, P, E -> O? not tried, P? not tried. E? at the end. What about the O? But SCOPE has O: so valid and without forbidden letters? Yes, because A, R, N are absent. O is new? Yes.

But we are trying C in position 2? In the first guess, C was tried in position 1 and got a dash. Now we try C in position 2: that'd be fine? But what if C is actually in position 3? We don't know. So either we try a word that moves the C to get more information.

But note: we know C is not in position 1, so positions 2,3,4 are possible. We can try a word that tests position 2? Or leave C out? We cannot leave C out because we are testing other letters? Actually, we must include the fact that C is present? No: we can guess without C? But why? We want to maximize information.

We can consider that the word must have C? So we should include C? Alternatively, we can test other letters without C? But we know C is present? Yes, absolutely: the dash in feedback for C means that at least one C is in the word. Therefore, we can use C again to try to pin down its position.

But note: we are only allowed to use valid words. So we must test letters we haven't tried? That's the idea? To use words that have many new letters? And try to see if they are present or absent? 

So for the second guess:

Option 1: include C and end with E, while testing three new positions (1,2,3) and having C in position 4 (like ""SPICE"", ""SLICE"", etc.)

Option 2: have C in position 2? Then the word must be S C ? ? E.

Possible words: ""SCOPE"" (S C O P E) which avoids R, A, N? Let's see: no A, no R, no N? Yes. O is not forbidden because we have not gotten feedback on O. Similarly, P wasn't tried.

Another: ""SCENE"" -> but N is absent? Cannot use. ""SCORE"" -> R is absent and O? R absent -> no. So ""SCOPE"" seems valid.

Or ""SCALE"": forbidden A -> no. ""SCUTE"" - not valid.

So between ""SCOPE"" (with C in position 2) and ""SLICE"" (with C in position 4). Which one? Both are valid.

Alternatively, we could put C in position 3? Like ""USICE"" -> not valid. Or ""EDUCE"": E D U C E -> but we are ending with E? Yes. Positions: 1:E, 2:D, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E. But we didn't try E elsewhere? We are putting E at position 1 and 5. The secret has E at position 5, but we don't know about position 1. However, we are not forbidden to try E elsewhere? Actually, we can. E could be in other positions? But note: in the feedback, E was only marked at position 5, so if we put E at position 1 and get a dash or nothing, that would tell us if there's another E. Or put E in position 1? It might be tricky.

But we have 6 tries, so we can test.

Another idea: use a word that has multiple E's? For example, ""EXILE"": E X I L E -> ends with E, as required. Then positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E. Then we would find out about E at position 1? But X is a low-frequency letter? Might not give much information.

So perhaps stick to common letters.

I think ""SCOPE"" and ""SLICE"" are both good options. But let me note that in ""SCOPE"", we put C in position 2. If we get C marked correct at position 2, we know it's correct; if dash, then C must be in 3 or 4? Actually, if C is in the word and not at position 2, then we would get a dash meaning it's present elsewhere? But we have position 1 as S? 

Alternatively, ""SLICE"": L in position 2? Then C in position 4.

Since we know C is present and not at position 1, I want to try a word with C in position 2? That is ""SCOPE"".

Or ""PRICE"", but R absent? Avoided.

So let me choose ""SCOPE"".

SCOPE: 
- Position 1: S -> might be? Not tested.
- Position 2: C -> if this is the correct position, we get ✓ for C? Otherwise, if C is at position 3 or 4, then we get a dash for position 2? Because C is in the word but not here? Then what? 

Actually, if we put C at position 2, and the secret word has C at position 4? Then we would get: 
- Position 1: S -> if S is absent? x? Or present? dash? 
- Position 2: C -> since C is actually at position 4, we would get a dash? Because C is in the word but here at location 2.
- Then position 3: O? might be absent?
- Position 4: P? then if P is present? but at position 4? 
This might not reveal much? 

Alternatively, a word that does not have C? Why? That could tell us that? We don't need because we know C is present? So we must include C? Because otherwise we might miss? Actually, no: we know C is present? So we can choose to put C in a different position? 

Actually, the best practice is to put letters we know are present in all subsequent guesses? So we must include C? And E at the end.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SLICE"":

SLICE: L is at position 2? Then C at position 4? Then we test S in position 1? And L, I, and then E? 

But note: we already tested E? So only S? is new? Then we test S? 

Alternatively, we can try ""CHIME"": C H I M E -> ends with E? Yes. Then put C at position 1? But we know that C is not at position 1? So that would give a dash for position 1? Because C is in the word elsewhere? So same as using C again? 

But ""CHIME"": positions? C at 1 (which is wrong, so expected dash), H, I, M, E? Then we don't learn much? 

So why SLICE? Actually, let me try to choose ""SPICE"" to check S, P, I? 

But I think any valid word that ends in E and contains C (in positions 2,3,4) and avoids R, A, N is good.

To maximize information: we want to test at least two positions for C? Actually, we can't? In one guess we can test only one position. So I prefer ""SCOPE"" to test C at position 2? 

But note: ""SCOPE"" uses O? Which is less common than other letters? 

How about ""SLICE"": S, L, I, C, E -> all letters are good? 

We can also consider ""BEICE"" -> not valid. 

Valid common words: 
- PIECE: P,I,E,C,E -> but we have E in position 3? Then we have two E's? Positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E -> but position 3 and 5? Then we have E? We know E is at position 5? But position 3? We don't know? And C is at position 4? 

But PIECE is valid? Let me use PIECE? Actually, PIECE is 5 letter word? Yes. But let me spell: P-I-E-C-E. So positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E. 

Then we would test P? and I? and E at position 3? Then C at position 4? 

Since we know the secret ends with E? If there's two E's? Then PIECE testing? 

But why PIECE? 

Alternatively, ""SINCE"": S I N C E -> but N forbidden? Cannot.

""SWIFE"" - not valid? 

Better: ""SPIKE""? S P I K E -> ends with E? Yes. But does not contain C? But we know C is present? Why not include C? 

Therefore, we must include C? So must include C? So SPIKE doesn't include C? Then missed opportunity? 

We know C exists? So we should include it? Even if we don't cover more letters? 

No: we want to test C along with other letters? 

We have to use C? Because we have 6 guesses? And we must keep including confirmed letters? 

But C is confirmed? 

So to move forward: 

I think we should use a word that tests the positions for C? 

Also, we don't know which positions? So we can try a common word that places C in a different position? 

Let's pick ""SLICE"": 

Guess: SLICE 

Response format will tell us S at position 1? L at position 2? I at position 3? C at position 4? 

If the secret word has C at position 4? Then we get ✓ for C? Or elsewhere? Dash? 

Alternatively, we pick ""SHINE"" - doesn't have C? Avoid.

No, must include C? 

Therefore, I choose SLICE? Or SCOPE? 

Let me check: SCOPE (C at position 2) vs SLICE (C at position 4). 

But we can also consider ""CLOSE"": C, L, O, S, E -> ends with E? Yes. Avoids R,A,N? S and L, O? Then C at position 1? But we know C is not at position 1? So putting C at position 1 again? That's going to give a dash? Which is known? So we waste one letter? 

But we test O, S, L? 

So CLOSE: positions 1:C (will yield dash since not 1), L, O, S, E? 

Then it tests L, O, S? 

But E? We know? So it tests three letters? 

But what if the secret word has C at position 2? Then our L? and O? 

But we won't learn? 

Actually, I think ""CLOSE"" is acceptable? Because we test L, O, S? 

But the feedback: for position 1? C will be dash? Meaning again C is elsewhere? Then we don't get new information on C? 

Whereas if we put C in a new position? That could give new information? 

So I prefer to put C in a different position? 

So ""SLICE"": S at position 1, L at position 2, I at position 3, C at position 4, E at position 5. 

Then I'll go with that? 

Or another: ""SPICE"" 

I'll choose ""SPICE"". 

Why SPICE? It uses S, P, I, C, E? P is common too? 

We haven't tested these letters? Good.

Therefore, I decide: SPICE 

So the guess is SPICE.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- E is in the correct position (5th letter), so the secret word ends with E.
- C is present in the word but not in position 1, as indicated by ""-"". So C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- R, A, and N are not in the word, as shown by ""x"" for the other letters.

For the second guess:
- Must end with E to match the known position.
- Must include C, since it is confirmed to be in the word, but avoid positions where we know it doesn't belong (position 1).
- Cannot include R, A, or N, as they are absent.
- Aim to test new common letters in other positions for maximum information gain.

The word ""SPICE"" fits these criteria:
- Ends with E: position 5 is E.
- Places C in position 4: testing a new position for C (previously tried in position 1).
- Uses new letters S, P, I: these are untested and common, helping to reveal their presence/absence.
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N).

This guess efficiently targets possible positions for C while providing information on other high-frequency letters.

<guess>SPICE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: SPICE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) C(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: CRANE
- C: dash (-) meaning C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: check (✓) meaning E is in the word and in position 5.

Second guess: SPICE
- S: x (not in the word)
- P: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- C: dash (-) meaning C is in the word but not in position 4 (since we placed it in position 4 here).
- E: check (✓) meaning E is in position 5 (which we already knew).

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The letter C is in the word, but not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, C must be in position 2 or 3.
3. The following letters are absent: R, A, N, S, P, I. (from the x's in both guesses)

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I. So we should avoid these except for C and E which are present.

Since C must be in position 2 or 3, and we know position 5 is E, we can form a word that has:
- Position 2: C? or Position 3: C?
- Position 5: E
- The other positions: new letters that we haven't tried.

We must avoid R, A, N, S, P, I.

Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word ending with E, with C in position 2 or 3, and using only the available letters.

Possible positions for C:
Case 1: C in position 2 -> pattern: _ C _ _ E
Case 2: C in position 3 -> pattern: _ _ C _ E

We need to choose a word that tests one of these cases and also tests new letters.

Let's consider case 1: C in position 2. What words fit _ C _ _ E?
Examples: 
- OCEAN? But O is available, but we have A and N absent? A and N are out, so no.
- ICY? Not 5 letters.
- We need 5 letters: _ C _ _ E.

Possible words: 
- ACUTE? But A is absent -> no.
- SCENE? S is absent -> no.
- Since S, P, I, R, A, N are out, we need words without them.

Let me think: 
- Maybe ""OCHRE""? But R is absent -> no.
- ""OCTET""? But T is available? O C T E T -> but ends with T, not E? No, we need E at the end.

Words ending with E: 
- ""DANCE""? But D is available, but A and N are out -> no.
- ""FENCE""? F is available, but E in position 2? F E N C E -> but that has E in position 2? And we don't know about other E's? But also N is out -> no.
- ""FORCE""? F O R C E -> but R is out -> no.
- ""HOUSE""? H O U S E -> S is out -> no.

This is tricky. Let's list possible words without the forbidden letters and ending with E, and C in position 2.

Forbidden: R, A, N, S, P, I.

So available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pattern: _ C _ _ E

Possible:
- ""OCHRE"" has R -> no.
- ""OCTAVE"" has A and is 6 letters -> no.
- ""OCTANE"" has A and N -> no.
- ""CYCLE""? C Y C L E -> but that has C in position 1 and 3? We need C in position 2? Position 1: C, 2: Y, 3: C, 4: L, 5: E -> but we are not allowed to put C in position 1? We know C is not in position 1, so we can't put it there? Actually, we can put it, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there? But in this word, C is in position 1 and 3? But we are trying to test C in position 2? This word doesn't have C in position 2.

We need exactly C in position 2.

Another word: ""ACTED"" -> A is out -> no.

""ECLAT"" -> not ending with E.

Perhaps ""DUCHY"" -> not ending with E.

I'm struggling. Let's consider case 2: C in position 3. Pattern: _ _ C _ E

Then we can have words like:
- A C _ _ E? But A is out.
- B _ C _ E: e.g., ""BICEP""? But I is out -> no.
- D _ C _ E: ""DICE""? But I is out -> no.
- F _ C _ E: ""FORCE""? R out -> no.
- G _ C _ E: ""GLACE""? G L A C E -> A out -> no.
- H _ C _ E: ""HENCE""? H E N C E -> N out -> no.
- L _ C _ E: ""LANCE""? A and N out -> no.
- M _ C _ E: ""MINCE""? I and N out -> no.
- O _ C _ E: ""OUNCE""? O U N C E -> N out -> no.
- T _ C _ E: ""TRACE""? R and A out -> no.
- U _ C _ E: ""UNICE""? U N I C E -> N and I out -> no.
- V _ C _ E: ""VOICE""? V O I C E -> I out -> no.
- W _ C _ E: ""WENCE""? Not common.

This is difficult. Maybe I missed some words.

Another idea: perhaps the word has double letters? But we don't know.

Or maybe C is in position 3: let's think of ""TOUCH"" -> not ending with E.

""BEECH""? B E E C H -> but E in position 2? And we have E at the end? Pattern: B E E C H -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:E, 4:C, 5:H -> not ending with E? No.

""BEIGE"" -> no C.

Perhaps ""C"" in position 3 and the last letter E, so the fourth letter can be various.

Let me list words ending with E and C in position 3:
- ABACE? Not a word.
- DANCE -> A and N out.
- FENCE -> N out.
- Hence -> N out.
- LANCE -> A and N out.
- MINCE -> I and N out.
- ONCE? 4 letters.
- PIECE -> I and P out? P is out? P is absent from second guess.
- PRICE -> P and R out.
- TRACE -> T R A C E -> R and A out.
- VOICE -> V O I C E -> I out.

All have forbidden letters.

But we have to use only available letters. Available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to find a word with pattern _ _ C _ E without forbidden letters.

For example:
- ""OUNCE"" has N -> no.
- ""TOUCE"" not a word.
- ""COUCH"" not ending with E.
- ""DOUCE""? D O U C E -> is that a word? Douce means sweet or pleasant? Yes, it's a valid word. D O U C E.

Letters: D, O, U, C, E. 
- D: not tried? Available.
- O: not tried.
- U: not tried.
- C: we know is present.
- E: known at position 5.

And it avoids R, A, N, S, P, I.

So ""DOUCE"" could be a candidate. Pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E.

But in this word, C is in position 4? But from the second guess, we have C in position 4 and got a dash, meaning C is not in position 4. So we cannot put C in position 4 again? We can, but it would be inefficient? Actually, we know C is not in position 4, so putting it there again would give a dash and not new information.

In ""DOUCE"", C is in position 4, which we already know is wrong. So we should avoid that.

We need to put C in position 2 or 3, not 4.

For pattern _ _ C _ E, position 3 is C, and position 4 is a new letter.

In ""DOUCE"", position 3 is U, position 4 is C? No: D O U C E -> position 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E. So C is in position 4, which is not allowed because we know C is not in position 4.

We need C in position 3 for this pattern? Pattern _ _ C _ E means:
Position 1: ?
Position 2: ?
Position 3: C
Position 4: ?
Position 5: E

For example, ""TRACE"" has position 3: A? No, T R A C E -> position 3 is A, position 4 is C.

I think I'm confusing the positions.

Let me clarify:
- For a word: positions 1,2,3,4,5.
- Pattern for C in position 3: so position 3 is C, and position 5 is E.
- So the word is: _ _ C _ E

The fourth letter is between C and E.

Examples:
- ""DANCE"": D A N C E -> position 3: N, position 4: C -> not C in position 3.
- ""MINCE"": M I N C E -> position 3: N, position 4: C.
- ""FORCE"": F O R C E -> position 3: R, position 4: C.
- ""BEICE"" not a word.
- ""SAUCE"": S A U C E -> position 3: U, position 4: C.

But S and A are out.

What about ""TOUCE""? Not a word.

""CHICE"" not a word.

""QUICE"" not a word.

""VOICE"": V O I C E -> position 3: I, position 4: C.

I is out.

""GLACE"": G L A C E -> position 3: A, position 4: C. A out.

""OUNCE"": O U N C E -> position 3: N, position 4: C. N out.

""URBAN"" not ending with E.

Perhaps ""OCTANE"" is 6 letters.

Another idea: ""C"" in position 2, pattern: _ C _ _ E

With available letters.

For example:
- ""OCHRE"" has R -> no.
- ""ACHED"" has A -> no.
- ""ECHO"" not 5 letters.
- ""ICILY"" not ending with E.

""UCKLE"" not starting.

""BCE"" not.

Let's think of ""OCTAVE"" too long.

Perhaps ""DECOY"" not ending with E.

I think I need to consider that the word might have C in position 3 and use a word like ""THYME"" but no C.

Another word: ""C"" in position 3: ""DICEY"" not ending with E.

""EXCEL"" E X C E L -> positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:C, 4:E, 5:L -> not ending with E? Ends with L.

But we know position 5 is E, so it must end with E.

""EXILE"" E X I L E -> I and L, but I is out.

""AXILE"" A out.

""DOCLE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""LOCKE"" not common.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words ending with E that have C in position 2 or 3 and use only available letters.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For C in position 2: pattern _ C _ _ E

- ""UCKER"" not and R out.
- ""ACER"" not 5 letters.
- ""ICER"" not 5 letters.
- ""OCEAN"" 5 letters but O C E A N -> position 2:C, but A and N out.
- ""OCREA"" not common.
- ""OCTET"" O C T E T -> ends with T, not E.
- ""OCTAD"" not ending with E.
- ""OCTAL"" not E.
- ""OCTYL"" not E.
- ""OCTIC"" not E.

Perhaps ""OCTAVE"" is 6.

Maybe ""YCLAD"" not.

I think I have to consider C in position 3 with pattern _ _ C _ E.

And the fourth letter must be one of the available letters.

For example:
- ""ABACUS"" not 5.
- ""BACCA"" not E.
- ""CACAO"" not E.
- ""DACHA"" D A C H A -> not E.
- ""FACED"" F A C E D -> not ending with E, and A out.
- ""GECKO"" not E.
- ""HOCUS"" not E.
- ""LACED"" L A C E D -> A out.
- ""MACED"" M A C E D -> A out.
- ""PACED"" P out and A out.
- ""RACED"" R and A out.
- ""VACUUM"" not 5.

But we need the fourth letter to be something, and then E.

Another word: ""OUNCE"" has N.

""TOUCE"" not a word.

""COUPE"" C O U P E -> but P is out, and C is in position 1? Oops, position 1:C, which we know is not.

""COUPE"" is C O U P E, so position 1:C (not allowed), position 4:P (out).

Not good.

""DOUCE"" is D O U C E, but C in position 4, which we know is not.

But we know C is not in position 4, so we should not put it there.

Perhaps we can use a word that has C in position 2 or 3, but I'm struggling to find one.

Another idea: maybe the secret word has two C's? But we don't know.

Or perhaps we can try a word that doesn't have C in position 4, but in position 2 or 3.

Let's try to find words with C in position 2: like ""SCARE"" but S and A out.

""SCORE"" S and R out.

""SCUTE"" S out.

""ECLAT"" not E.

""ICILY"" not E.

""OCEAN"" not.

Perhaps ""YCLAD"" not.

Let's consider C in position 3: ""LYCEE"" L Y C E E -> is that a word? Lycee, yes, a type of school. L Y C E E.

Positions: 1:L, 2:Y, 3:C, 4:E, 5:E.

But position 4 is E, and position 5 is E. We know position 5 is E, but position 4 is also E? That's possible.

Letters: L, Y, C, E, E.

- L: available
- Y: available
- C: present
- E: present at position 5, and we are testing E at position 4? But we know E is at position 5, but it could be elsewhere.

But in the feedback, we only know about position 5 E, not about other positions.

Also, ""LYCEE"" has E in position 4 and 5.

But in the word, position 3 is C, which is what we want.

And it avoids forbidden letters: no R, A, N, S, P, I.

So ""LYCEE"" is a valid guess.

Pattern: _ _ C _ E, with position 3:C, position 5:E.

In ""LYCEE"", position 3 is C, position 4 is E, position 5 is E.

So we can guess ""LYCEE"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has C in position 3, then we get C correct there. If not, we get a dash.

Also, we test L and Y.

Another possibility: ""OUNCE"" but N out.

""ounce"" has N, so no.

""TOUCE"" not a word.

""YOUCE"" not.

So ""LYCEE"" seems like a good option.

But ""LYCEE"" has two E's, which is fine.

We can also consider ""C"" in position 2: but I can't find a word with available letters.

Another word: ""C"" in position 2: ""ACHOO"" not E.

""ECRUS"" not.

I think ""LYCEE"" is our best bet.

So I'll go with ""LYCEE"".

But let's make sure about the spelling: L-Y-C-E-E, yes, it's a valid word.

So guess: LYCEE

In the response, we will see:
- Position 1: L
- Position 2: Y
- Position 3: C
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: E (known)

We know position 5 is E, so it will be correct.

Position 4 is E, which might be correct or not? We don't know.

But the main point is to test C in position 3 and get information on L and Y.

If C is in position 3, we get a check; if not, a dash.

Also, if E is in position 4, we get a check or dash.

But since we have two E's, it might be messy, but it's acceptable.

Another word: ""OCTAD"" not ending with E.

I think we have to go with it.

So the guess is LYCEE.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  This means:  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - R, A, and N are not in the word.  
  - E is in the word and in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: SPICE → Feedback: S(x) P(x) I(x) C(-) E(✓)**  
  This means:  
  - S, P, and I are not in the word.  
  - C is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - E is confirmed in position 5 (already known).  

### Key Insights:
1. **Position 5 is E**: The word ends with E.  
2. **C is present but position is unknown**:  
   - C is not in position 1 (from CRANE) or position 4 (from SPICE).  
   - Therefore, C must be in position 2 or 3.  
3. **Absent letters**: R, A, N, S, P, I are not in the word. Avoid using these.  
4. **Available letters**: Focus on untried common letters like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- **Test C in position 3**: Since C cannot be in positions 1 or 4, position 3 is a key uncertainty. Position 2 will be tested if position 3 is ruled out later.  
- **Maximize information**: Use a word with C in position 3, E in position 5, and new high-frequency letters in other positions to test for presence/absence.  
- **Avoid wasted letters**: Do not reuse absent letters (R, A, N, S, P, I).  

The word **""LYCEE""** fits perfectly:  
- **L** (position 1): Untried letter.  
- **Y** (position 2): Untried letter.  
- **C** (position 3): Tests C in position 3 (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we get - and know C is in position 2).  
- **E** (position 4): Tests if E appears elsewhere (we only know it's in position 5).  
- **E** (position 5): Confirmed E (will be ✓).  

This guess efficiently narrows down C's position and tests new letters (L, Y) while adhering to constraints.

Actually, we can\'t put C in position 1 because in the feedback, C was in position 1 and got a ""-"", meaning that while C is in the word, it\'s not in position 1. Therefore, C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n  But note: the word has C, and it is not in position 1 because we got a ""-"" for position 1. Also, since position 5 is E, C must be in position 2, 3, or 4.\n\nAdditionally, we must exclude R, A, N.\n\nWe are on the second guess. We want to use the information we have: the word has the letter C (not in position 1) and ends with E.\n\nWe can consider words that start with a letter we haven\'t tried yet (like S, T, etc.) and have C in positions 2, 3, or 4, and end with E.\n\nHow about ""SPICE""?\n- S: new letter\n- P: new letter\n- I: new letter\n- C: we are testing C in the 4th position (since in CRANE it was in position 1 and wrong, so now try a different position).\n- E: at the end, which is fixed.\n\nBut note: in ""CRANE"", we got that E is correct at position 5, so any guess must have E in the 5th position.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has C in the second position? Like ""SCONE""? But S, C, O, N, E. But we know N is absent (from previous feedback: N(x)), so we cannot use N.\n\nWe cannot use letters that were marked absent: R, A, N.\n\nLet me list the constraints:\n- Position 5: E\n- Letters present: C (in position 2, 3, or 4)\n- Letters not present: R, A, N\n\nWe can also consider that the word has exactly the E and the C, and then three other letters? But we don\'t know how many more.\n\nOur next guess should aim to test multiple possibilities.\n\nA word ending with E that has C in either position 2, 3, or 4 and doesn\'t contain R, A, N.\n\nLet\'s think of words that end with E and have a C:\n\nPossible words:\n- With C in position 2: ...? Like SC _ _ E. E.g., ""SCENE"", ""SCOPE"", ""SCARE"", but we cannot use A (because A is absent) and R is absent. So ""SCENE"": S, C, E, N, E -> but N is absent and E in the third position? But we already know position 5 is E.\n\n""SCENE"": S, C, E, N, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:C, 3:E, 4:N, 5:E. But N is absent so we cannot use it. Also, E in position 3? We don\'t know about E elsewhere.\n\nActually, we only know about position 5 being E. E could appear elsewhere? But the feedback for E in ""CRANE"" was only position 5 having E, so that E elsewhere might be present or not? The feedback symbol only tells about the position we put it. Since we put E only in position 5, we don\'t know if E appears elsewhere? However, note that if E appeared elsewhere, we would have seen another symbol? But in the feedback, we only got one E marked as correct (position 5). The other letters were C(-), R(x), A(x), N(x). So there was no E in the word elsewhere? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t show multiple marks for a letter if it appears multiple times? Therefore, we must be cautious.\n\nIn Wordle rules: if a letter appears multiple times in the secret, and you guess it multiple times, each occurrence is evaluated separately. But if you guess a letter once and it appears multiple times, the feedback might only mark the correct/incorrect occurrences accordingly? Actually, no: the feedback is per position. So let us be precise:\n\nIn ""CRANE"":\n- Position 1: C -> marked with dash (-), meaning C is in the word but not in position 1. It doesn\'t tell us how many times C appears, only that at least one C is in the word (but not at position 1).\n\nSimilarly, E at position 5 is marked as correct (✓) meaning that E is in the word at position 5. But it doesn\'t tell us if E appears elsewhere? Actually, the absence of an E mark elsewhere doesn\'t tell, because we didn\'t put E elsewhere.\n\nSo we know:\n- The word has a E at position 5.\n- The word has at least one C, but not at position 1.\n\nNow for the guess, we are forced to end with E.\n\nAnother possibility: ""PRICE"" -> P, R, I, C, E. But we cannot use R because R is absent (from feedback: R(x)). So avoid R.\n\nSimilarly, avoid A and N.\n\nSo let\'s find a word without R, A, N, ending in E, and with a C in one of positions 2,3,4.\n\nHow about ""PLACE"": P, L, A, C, E -> but A is absent? We cannot use A.\n\nHow about ""SPICE"": S, P, I, C, E -> positions: 1:S, 2:P, 3:I, 4:C, 5:E. That seems good because S, P, I are new letters and we are testing C at position 4.\n\nAlternatively, we could try ""SPACE"": S, P, A, C, E -> but A is absent so we shouldn\'t use A.\n\nAnother word: ""SLICE"": S, L, I, C, E -> avoids R, A, N.\n\nOr ""SHICE"" - not valid? SHICE is not a word. \n\nValid words: \n- SLICE: yes, a valid word.\n- OPINE: O, P, I, N, E -> but N is absent? Cannot use N.\n- Since we cannot use N, avoid it.\n\nSo SLICE might work: S, L, I, C, E.\n\nBut wait, in SLICE, we are putting C in position 4. Could we put C in position 2? Like ""SCALE"": S, C, A, L, E -> A is absent, not allowed.\n\nOr ""SCOPE"": S, C, O, P, E -> O? not tried, P? not tried. E? at the end. What about the O? But SCOPE has O: so valid and without forbidden letters? Yes, because A, R, N are absent. O is new? Yes.\n\nBut we are trying C in position 2? In the first guess, C was tried in position 1 and got a dash. Now we try C in position 2: that\'d be fine? But what if C is actually in position 3? We don\'t know. So either we try a word that moves the C to get more information.\n\nBut note: we know C is not in position 1, so positions 2,3,4 are possible. We can try a word that tests position 2? Or leave C out? We cannot leave C out because we are testing other letters? Actually, we must include the fact that C is present? No: we can guess without C? But why? We want to maximize information.\n\nWe can consider that the word must have C? So we should include C? Alternatively, we can test other letters without C? But we know C is present? Yes, absolutely: the dash in feedback for C means that at least one C is in the word. Therefore, we can use C again to try to pin down its position.\n\nBut note: we are only allowed to use valid words. So we must test letters we haven\'t tried? That\'s the idea? To use words that have many new letters? And try to see if they are present or absent? \n\nSo for the second guess:\n\nOption 1: include C and end with E, while testing three new positions (1,2,3) and having C in position 4 (like ""SPICE"", ""SLICE"", etc.)\n\nOption 2: have C in position 2? Then the word must be S C ? ? E.\n\nPossible words: ""SCOPE"" (S C O P E) which avoids R, A, N? Let\'s see: no A, no R, no N? Yes. O is not forbidden because we have not gotten feedback on O. Similarly, P wasn\'t tried.\n\nAnother: ""SCENE"" -> but N is absent? Cannot use. ""SCORE"" -> R is absent and O? R absent -> no. So ""SCOPE"" seems valid.\n\nOr ""SCALE"": forbidden A -> no. ""SCUTE"" - not valid.\n\nSo between ""SCOPE"" (with C in position 2) and ""SLICE"" (with C in position 4). Which one? Both are valid.\n\nAlternatively, we could put C in position 3? Like ""USICE"" -> not valid. Or ""EDUCE"": E D U C E -> but we are ending with E? Yes. Positions: 1:E, 2:D, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E. But we didn\'t try E elsewhere? We are putting E at position 1 and 5. The secret has E at position 5, but we don\'t know about position 1. However, we are not forbidden to try E elsewhere? Actually, we can. E could be in other positions? But note: in the feedback, E was only marked at position 5, so if we put E at position 1 and get a dash or nothing, that would tell us if there\'s another E. Or put E in position 1? It might be tricky.\n\nBut we have 6 tries, so we can test.\n\nAnother idea: use a word that has multiple E\'s? For example, ""EXILE"": E X I L E -> ends with E, as required. Then positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:I, 4:L, 5:E. Then we would find out about E at position 1? But X is a low-frequency letter? Might not give much information.\n\nSo perhaps stick to common letters.\n\nI think ""SCOPE"" and ""SLICE"" are both good options. But let me note that in ""SCOPE"", we put C in position 2. If we get C marked correct at position 2, we know it\'s correct; if dash, then C must be in 3 or 4? Actually, if C is in the word and not at position 2, then we would get a dash meaning it\'s present elsewhere? But we have position 1 as S? \n\nAlternatively, ""SLICE"": L in position 2? Then C in position 4.\n\nSince we know C is present and not at position 1, I want to try a word with C in position 2? That is ""SCOPE"".\n\nOr ""PRICE"", but R absent? Avoided.\n\nSo let me choose ""SCOPE"".\n\nSCOPE: \n- Position 1: S -> might be? Not tested.\n- Position 2: C -> if this is the correct position, we get ✓ for C? Otherwise, if C is at position 3 or 4, then we get a dash for position 2? Because C is in the word but not here? Then what? \n\nActually, if we put C at position 2, and the secret word has C at position 4? Then we would get: \n- Position 1: S -> if S is absent? x? Or present? dash? \n- Position 2: C -> since C is actually at position 4, we would get a dash? Because C is in the word but here at location 2.\n- Then position 3: O? might be absent?\n- Position 4: P? then if P is present? but at position 4? \nThis might not reveal much? \n\nAlternatively, a word that does not have C? Why? That could tell us that? We don\'t need because we know C is present? So we must include C? Because otherwise we might miss? Actually, no: we know C is present? So we can choose to put C in a different position? \n\nActually, the best practice is to put letters we know are present in all subsequent guesses? So we must include C? And E at the end.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""SLICE"":\n\nSLICE: L is at position 2? Then C at position 4? Then we test S in position 1? And L, I, and then E? \n\nBut note: we already tested E? So only S? is new? Then we test S? \n\nAlternatively, we can try ""CHIME"": C H I M E -> ends with E? Yes. Then put C at position 1? But we know that C is not at position 1? So that would give a dash for position 1? Because C is in the word elsewhere? So same as using C again? \n\nBut ""CHIME"": positions? C at 1 (which is wrong, so expected dash), H, I, M, E? Then we don\'t learn much? \n\nSo why SLICE? Actually, let me try to choose ""SPICE"" to check S, P, I? \n\nBut I think any valid word that ends in E and contains C (in positions 2,3,4) and avoids R, A, N is good.\n\nTo maximize information: we want to test at least two positions for C? Actually, we can\'t? In one guess we can test only one position. So I prefer ""SCOPE"" to test C at position 2? \n\nBut note: ""SCOPE"" uses O? Which is less common than other letters? \n\nHow about ""SLICE"": S, L, I, C, E -> all letters are good? \n\nWe can also consider ""BEICE"" -> not valid. \n\nValid common words: \n- PIECE: P,I,E,C,E -> but we have E in position 3? Then we have two E\'s? Positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E -> but position 3 and 5? Then we have E? We know E is at position 5? But position 3? We don\'t know? And C is at position 4? \n\nBut PIECE is valid? Let me use PIECE? Actually, PIECE is 5 letter word? Yes. But let me spell: P-I-E-C-E. So positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E. \n\nThen we would test P? and I? and E at position 3? Then C at position 4? \n\nSince we know the secret ends with E? If there\'s two E\'s? Then PIECE testing? \n\nBut why PIECE? \n\nAlternatively, ""SINCE"": S I N C E -> but N forbidden? Cannot.\n\n""SWIFE"" - not valid? \n\nBetter: ""SPIKE""? S P I K E -> ends with E? Yes. But does not contain C? But we know C is present? Why not include C? \n\nTherefore, we must include C? So must include C? So SPIKE doesn\'t include C? Then missed opportunity? \n\nWe know C exists? So we should include it? Even if we don\'t cover more letters? \n\nNo: we want to test C along with other letters? \n\nWe have to use C? Because we have 6 guesses? And we must keep including confirmed letters? \n\nBut C is confirmed? \n\nSo to move forward: \n\nI think we should use a word that tests the positions for C? \n\nAlso, we don\'t know which positions? So we can try a common word that places C in a different position? \n\nLet\'s pick ""SLICE"": \n\nGuess: SLICE \n\nResponse format will tell us S at position 1? L at position 2? I at position 3? C at position 4? \n\nIf the secret word has C at position 4? Then we get ✓ for C? Or elsewhere? Dash? \n\nAlternatively, we pick ""SHINE"" - doesn\'t have C? Avoid.\n\nNo, must include C? \n\nTherefore, I choose SLICE? Or SCOPE? \n\nLet me check: SCOPE (C at position 2) vs SLICE (C at position 4). \n\nBut we can also consider ""CLOSE"": C, L, O, S, E -> ends with E? Yes. Avoids R,A,N? S and L, O? Then C at position 1? But we know C is not at position 1? So putting C at position 1 again? That\'s going to give a dash? Which is known? So we waste one letter? \n\nBut we test O, S, L? \n\nSo CLOSE: positions 1:C (will yield dash since not 1), L, O, S, E? \n\nThen it tests L, O, S? \n\nBut E? We know? So it tests three letters? \n\nBut what if the secret word has C at position 2? Then our L? and O? \n\nBut we won\'t learn? \n\nActually, I think ""CLOSE"" is acceptable? Because we test L, O, S? \n\nBut the feedback: for position 1? C will be dash? Meaning again C is elsewhere? Then we don\'t get new information on C? \n\nWhereas if we put C in a new position? That could give new information? \n\nSo I prefer to put C in a different position? \n\nSo ""SLICE"": S at position 1, L at position 2, I at position 3, C at position 4, E at position 5. \n\nThen I\'ll go with that? \n\nOr another: ""SPICE"" \n\nI\'ll choose ""SPICE"". \n\nWhy SPICE? It uses S, P, I, C, E? P is common too? \n\nWe haven\'t tested these letters? Good.\n\nTherefore, I decide: SPICE \n\nSo the guess is SPICE.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- E is in the correct position (5th letter), so the secret word ends with E.\n- C is present in the word but not in position 1, as indicated by ""-"". So C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n- R, A, and N are not in the word, as shown by ""x"" for the other letters.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Must end with E to match the known position.\n- Must include C, since it is confirmed to be in the word, but avoid positions where we know it doesn\'t belong (position 1).\n- Cannot include R, A, or N, as they are absent.\n- Aim to test new common letters in other positions for maximum information gain.\n\nThe word ""SPICE"" fits these criteria:\n- Ends with E: position 5 is E.\n- Places C in position 4: testing a new position for C (previously tried in position 1).\n- Uses new letters S, P, I: these are untested and common, helping to reveal their presence/absence.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (R, A, N).\n\nThis guess efficiently targets possible positions for C while providing information on other high-frequency letters.\n\n<guess>SPICE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: SPICE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) C(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: CRANE\n- C: dash (-) meaning C is in the word but not in position 1.\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: check (✓) meaning E is in the word and in position 5.\n\nSecond guess: SPICE\n- S: x (not in the word)\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- C: dash (-) meaning C is in the word but not in position 4 (since we placed it in position 4 here).\n- E: check (✓) meaning E is in position 5 (which we already knew).\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. The secret word ends with E (position 5 is E).\n2. The letter C is in the word, but not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, C must be in position 2 or 3.\n3. The following letters are absent: R, A, N, S, P, I. (from the x\'s in both guesses)\n\nWe have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, P, I. So we should avoid these except for C and E which are present.\n\nSince C must be in position 2 or 3, and we know position 5 is E, we can form a word that has:\n- Position 2: C? or Position 3: C?\n- Position 5: E\n- The other positions: new letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\nWe must avoid R, A, N, S, P, I.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word ending with E, with C in position 2 or 3, and using only the available letters.\n\nPossible positions for C:\nCase 1: C in position 2 -> pattern: _ C _ _ E\nCase 2: C in position 3 -> pattern: _ _ C _ E\n\nWe need to choose a word that tests one of these cases and also tests new letters.\n\nLet\'s consider case 1: C in position 2. What words fit _ C _ _ E?\nExamples: \n- OCEAN? But O is available, but we have A and N absent? A and N are out, so no.\n- ICY? Not 5 letters.\n- We need 5 letters: _ C _ _ E.\n\nPossible words: \n- ACUTE? But A is absent -> no.\n- SCENE? S is absent -> no.\n- Since S, P, I, R, A, N are out, we need words without them.\n\nLet me think: \n- Maybe ""OCHRE""? But R is absent -> no.\n- ""OCTET""? But T is available? O C T E T -> but ends with T, not E? No, we need E at the end.\n\nWords ending with E: \n- ""DANCE""? But D is available, but A and N are out -> no.\n- ""FENCE""? F is available, but E in position 2? F E N C E -> but that has E in position 2? And we don\'t know about other E\'s? But also N is out -> no.\n- ""FORCE""? F O R C E -> but R is out -> no.\n- ""HOUSE""? H O U S E -> S is out -> no.\n\nThis is tricky. Let\'s list possible words without the forbidden letters and ending with E, and C in position 2.\n\nForbidden: R, A, N, S, P, I.\n\nSo available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPattern: _ C _ _ E\n\nPossible:\n- ""OCHRE"" has R -> no.\n- ""OCTAVE"" has A and is 6 letters -> no.\n- ""OCTANE"" has A and N -> no.\n- ""CYCLE""? C Y C L E -> but that has C in position 1 and 3? We need C in position 2? Position 1: C, 2: Y, 3: C, 4: L, 5: E -> but we are not allowed to put C in position 1? We know C is not in position 1, so we can\'t put it there? Actually, we can put it, but it would be a waste because we know it\'s not there? But in this word, C is in position 1 and 3? But we are trying to test C in position 2? This word doesn\'t have C in position 2.\n\nWe need exactly C in position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""ACTED"" -> A is out -> no.\n\n""ECLAT"" -> not ending with E.\n\nPerhaps ""DUCHY"" -> not ending with E.\n\nI\'m struggling. Let\'s consider case 2: C in position 3. Pattern: _ _ C _ E\n\nThen we can have words like:\n- A C _ _ E? But A is out.\n- B _ C _ E: e.g., ""BICEP""? But I is out -> no.\n- D _ C _ E: ""DICE""? But I is out -> no.\n- F _ C _ E: ""FORCE""? R out -> no.\n- G _ C _ E: ""GLACE""? G L A C E -> A out -> no.\n- H _ C _ E: ""HENCE""? H E N C E -> N out -> no.\n- L _ C _ E: ""LANCE""? A and N out -> no.\n- M _ C _ E: ""MINCE""? I and N out -> no.\n- O _ C _ E: ""OUNCE""? O U N C E -> N out -> no.\n- T _ C _ E: ""TRACE""? R and A out -> no.\n- U _ C _ E: ""UNICE""? U N I C E -> N and I out -> no.\n- V _ C _ E: ""VOICE""? V O I C E -> I out -> no.\n- W _ C _ E: ""WENCE""? Not common.\n\nThis is difficult. Maybe I missed some words.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word has double letters? But we don\'t know.\n\nOr maybe C is in position 3: let\'s think of ""TOUCH"" -> not ending with E.\n\n""BEECH""? B E E C H -> but E in position 2? And we have E at the end? Pattern: B E E C H -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:E, 4:C, 5:H -> not ending with E? No.\n\n""BEIGE"" -> no C.\n\nPerhaps ""C"" in position 3 and the last letter E, so the fourth letter can be various.\n\nLet me list words ending with E and C in position 3:\n- ABACE? Not a word.\n- DANCE -> A and N out.\n- FENCE -> N out.\n- Hence -> N out.\n- LANCE -> A and N out.\n- MINCE -> I and N out.\n- ONCE? 4 letters.\n- PIECE -> I and P out? P is out? P is absent from second guess.\n- PRICE -> P and R out.\n- TRACE -> T R A C E -> R and A out.\n- VOICE -> V O I C E -> I out.\n\nAll have forbidden letters.\n\nBut we have to use only available letters. Available: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nLet\'s try to find a word with pattern _ _ C _ E without forbidden letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""OUNCE"" has N -> no.\n- ""TOUCE"" not a word.\n- ""COUCH"" not ending with E.\n- ""DOUCE""? D O U C E -> is that a word? Douce means sweet or pleasant? Yes, it\'s a valid word. D O U C E.\n\nLetters: D, O, U, C, E. \n- D: not tried? Available.\n- O: not tried.\n- U: not tried.\n- C: we know is present.\n- E: known at position 5.\n\nAnd it avoids R, A, N, S, P, I.\n\nSo ""DOUCE"" could be a candidate. Pattern: 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E.\n\nBut in this word, C is in position 4? But from the second guess, we have C in position 4 and got a dash, meaning C is not in position 4. So we cannot put C in position 4 again? We can, but it would be inefficient? Actually, we know C is not in position 4, so putting it there again would give a dash and not new information.\n\nIn ""DOUCE"", C is in position 4, which we already know is wrong. So we should avoid that.\n\nWe need to put C in position 2 or 3, not 4.\n\nFor pattern _ _ C _ E, position 3 is C, and position 4 is a new letter.\n\nIn ""DOUCE"", position 3 is U, position 4 is C? No: D O U C E -> position 1:D, 2:O, 3:U, 4:C, 5:E. So C is in position 4, which is not allowed because we know C is not in position 4.\n\nWe need C in position 3 for this pattern? Pattern _ _ C _ E means:\nPosition 1: ?\nPosition 2: ?\nPosition 3: C\nPosition 4: ?\nPosition 5: E\n\nFor example, ""TRACE"" has position 3: A? No, T R A C E -> position 3 is A, position 4 is C.\n\nI think I\'m confusing the positions.\n\nLet me clarify:\n- For a word: positions 1,2,3,4,5.\n- Pattern for C in position 3: so position 3 is C, and position 5 is E.\n- So the word is: _ _ C _ E\n\nThe fourth letter is between C and E.\n\nExamples:\n- ""DANCE"": D A N C E -> position 3: N, position 4: C -> not C in position 3.\n- ""MINCE"": M I N C E -> position 3: N, position 4: C.\n- ""FORCE"": F O R C E -> position 3: R, position 4: C.\n- ""BEICE"" not a word.\n- ""SAUCE"": S A U C E -> position 3: U, position 4: C.\n\nBut S and A are out.\n\nWhat about ""TOUCE""? Not a word.\n\n""CHICE"" not a word.\n\n""QUICE"" not a word.\n\n""VOICE"": V O I C E -> position 3: I, position 4: C.\n\nI is out.\n\n""GLACE"": G L A C E -> position 3: A, position 4: C. A out.\n\n""OUNCE"": O U N C E -> position 3: N, position 4: C. N out.\n\n""URBAN"" not ending with E.\n\nPerhaps ""OCTANE"" is 6 letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""C"" in position 2, pattern: _ C _ _ E\n\nWith available letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""OCHRE"" has R -> no.\n- ""ACHED"" has A -> no.\n- ""ECHO"" not 5 letters.\n- ""ICILY"" not ending with E.\n\n""UCKLE"" not starting.\n\n""BCE"" not.\n\nLet\'s think of ""OCTAVE"" too long.\n\nPerhaps ""DECOY"" not ending with E.\n\nI think I need to consider that the word might have C in position 3 and use a word like ""THYME"" but no C.\n\nAnother word: ""C"" in position 3: ""DICEY"" not ending with E.\n\n""EXCEL"" E X C E L -> positions: 1:E, 2:X, 3:C, 4:E, 5:L -> not ending with E? Ends with L.\n\nBut we know position 5 is E, so it must end with E.\n\n""EXILE"" E X I L E -> I and L, but I is out.\n\n""AXILE"" A out.\n\n""DOCLE"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""LOCKE"" not common.\n\nLet\'s list all possible 5-letter words ending with E that have C in position 2 or 3 and use only available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFor C in position 2: pattern _ C _ _ E\n\n- ""UCKER"" not and R out.\n- ""ACER"" not 5 letters.\n- ""ICER"" not 5 letters.\n- ""OCEAN"" 5 letters but O C E A N -> position 2:C, but A and N out.\n- ""OCREA"" not common.\n- ""OCTET"" O C T E T -> ends with T, not E.\n- ""OCTAD"" not ending with E.\n- ""OCTAL"" not E.\n- ""OCTYL"" not E.\n- ""OCTIC"" not E.\n\nPerhaps ""OCTAVE"" is 6.\n\nMaybe ""YCLAD"" not.\n\nI think I have to consider C in position 3 with pattern _ _ C _ E.\n\nAnd the fourth letter must be one of the available letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""ABACUS"" not 5.\n- ""BACCA"" not E.\n- ""CACAO"" not E.\n- ""DACHA"" D A C H A -> not E.\n- ""FACED"" F A C E D -> not ending with E, and A out.\n- ""GECKO"" not E.\n- ""HOCUS"" not E.\n- ""LACED"" L A C E D -> A out.\n- ""MACED"" M A C E D -> A out.\n- ""PACED"" P out and A out.\n- ""RACED"" R and A out.\n- ""VACUUM"" not 5.\n\nBut we need the fourth letter to be something, and then E.\n\nAnother word: ""OUNCE"" has N.\n\n""TOUCE"" not a word.\n\n""COUPE"" C O U P E -> but P is out, and C is in position 1? Oops, position 1:C, which we know is not.\n\n""COUPE"" is C O U P E, so position 1:C (not allowed), position 4:P (out).\n\nNot good.\n\n""DOUCE"" is D O U C E, but C in position 4, which we know is not.\n\nBut we know C is not in position 4, so we should not put it there.\n\nPerhaps we can use a word that has C in position 2 or 3, but I\'m struggling to find one.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the secret word has two C\'s? But we don\'t know.\n\nOr perhaps we can try a word that doesn\'t have C in position 4, but in position 2 or 3.\n\nLet\'s try to find words with C in position 2: like ""SCARE"" but S and A out.\n\n""SCORE"" S and R out.\n\n""SCUTE"" S out.\n\n""ECLAT"" not E.\n\n""ICILY"" not E.\n\n""OCEAN"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""YCLAD"" not.\n\nLet\'s consider C in position 3: ""LYCEE"" L Y C E E -> is that a word? Lycee, yes, a type of school. L Y C E E.\n\nPositions: 1:L, 2:Y, 3:C, 4:E, 5:E.\n\nBut position 4 is E, and position 5 is E. We know position 5 is E, but position 4 is also E? That\'s possible.\n\nLetters: L, Y, C, E, E.\n\n- L: available\n- Y: available\n- C: present\n- E: present at position 5, and we are testing E at position 4? But we know E is at position 5, but it could be elsewhere.\n\nBut in the feedback, we only know about position 5 E, not about other positions.\n\nAlso, ""LYCEE"" has E in position 4 and 5.\n\nBut in the word, position 3 is C, which is what we want.\n\nAnd it avoids forbidden letters: no R, A, N, S, P, I.\n\nSo ""LYCEE"" is a valid guess.\n\nPattern: _ _ C _ E, with position 3:C, position 5:E.\n\nIn ""LYCEE"", position 3 is C, position 4 is E, position 5 is E.\n\nSo we can guess ""LYCEE"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we might get.\n\nIf the secret word has C in position 3, then we get C correct there. If not, we get a dash.\n\nAlso, we test L and Y.\n\nAnother possibility: ""OUNCE"" but N out.\n\n""ounce"" has N, so no.\n\n""TOUCE"" not a word.\n\n""YOUCE"" not.\n\nSo ""LYCEE"" seems like a good option.\n\nBut ""LYCEE"" has two E\'s, which is fine.\n\nWe can also consider ""C"" in position 2: but I can\'t find a word with available letters.\n\nAnother word: ""C"" in position 2: ""ACHOO"" not E.\n\n""ECRUS"" not.\n\nI think ""LYCEE"" is our best bet.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""LYCEE"".\n\nBut let\'s make sure about the spelling: L-Y-C-E-E, yes, it\'s a valid word.\n\nSo guess: LYCEE\n\nIn the response, we will see:\n- Position 1: L\n- Position 2: Y\n- Position 3: C\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: E (known)\n\nWe know position 5 is E, so it will be correct.\n\nPosition 4 is E, which might be correct or not? We don\'t know.\n\nBut the main point is to test C in position 3 and get information on L and Y.\n\nIf C is in position 3, we get a check; if not, a dash.\n\nAlso, if E is in position 4, we get a check or dash.\n\nBut since we have two E\'s, it might be messy, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""OCTAD"" not ending with E.\n\nI think we have to go with it.\n\nSo the guess is LYCEE.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  \n  This means:  \n  - C is in the word but not in position 1.  \n  - R, A, and N are not in the word.  \n  - E is in the word and in position 5.  \n\n- **Guess 2: SPICE → Feedback: S(x) P(x) I(x) C(-) E(✓)**  \n  This means:  \n  - S, P, and I are not in the word.  \n  - C is in the word but not in position 4.  \n  - E is confirmed in position 5 (already known).  \n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Position 5 is E**: The word ends with E.  \n2. **C is present but position is unknown**:  \n   - C is not in position 1 (from CRANE) or position 4 (from SPICE).  \n   - Therefore, C must be in position 2 or 3.  \n3. **Absent letters**: R, A, N, S, P, I are not in the word. Avoid using these.  \n4. **Available letters**: Focus on untried common letters like B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- **Test C in position 3**: Since C cannot be in positions 1 or 4, position 3 is a key uncertainty. Position 2 will be tested if position 3 is ruled out later.  \n- **Maximize information**: Use a word with C in position 3, E in position 5, and new high-frequency letters in other positions to test for presence/absence.  \n- **Avoid wasted letters**: Do not reuse absent letters (R, A, N, S, P, I).  \n\nThe word **""LYCEE""** fits perfectly:  \n- **L** (position 1): Untried letter.  \n- **Y** (position 2): Untried letter.  \n- **C** (position 3): Tests C in position 3 (if correct, we get ✓; if not, we get - and know C is in position 2).  \n- **E** (position 4): Tests if E appears elsewhere (we only know it\'s in position 5).  \n- **E** (position 5): Confirmed E (will be ✓).  \n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down C\'s position and tests new letters (L, Y) while adhering to constraints.\n\n<guess>LYCEE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: SPICE -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) I(x) C(-) E(✓)\nGuess 3: LYCEE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) Y(x) C(✓) E(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: dash (-) → C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R: x → not in the word.
- A: x → not in the word.
- N: x → not in the word.
- E: check (✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

Guess 2: SPICE
- S: x → not in the word.
- P: x → not in the word.
- I: x → not in the word.
- C: dash (-) → C is in the word but not in position 4.
- E: check (✓) → E is in position 5 (already known).

Guess 3: LYCEE
- L: x → not in the word.
- Y: x → not in the word.
- C: check (✓) → C is in the word and in position 3.
- E: check (✓) → E is in the word and in position 4? But note: the feedback shows two E's. Let's parse:
  - The feedback is: L(x) Y(x) C(✓) E(✓) E(✓)
  - Since the word is L-Y-C-E-E, positions are:
    - Position 1: L → x
    - Position 2: Y → x
    - Position 3: C → ✓
    - Position 4: E → ✓
    - Position 5: E → ✓

So the feedback for the E's: 
- Position 4: E is correct (✓) → so E is in position 4.
- Position 5: E is correct (✓) → we already knew that.

Therefore, from Guess 3, we have:
- C is in position 3 (✓).
- E is in position 4 (✓) and position 5 (✓).
- L and Y are not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has:
   - Position 3: C
   - Position 4: E
   - Position 5: E

So the word pattern is: _ _ C E E

2. We also know that C is in position 3, and we have two E's: one in position 4 and one in position 5.

3. Absent letters: R, A, N, S, P, I, L, Y.

4. We know that C is present (in position 3) and E is present (in positions 4 and 5). Also, from the first guess, we know that C is not in position 1 (but now we know it's in position 3, so that's consistent).

5. The word must be of the form: _ _ C E E

We need to find the first two letters. They must be from the remaining available letters, avoiding the absent ones.

Available letters (not tried and not absent): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z. (Note: we have used C, E, R, A, N, S, P, I, L, Y; so the rest are available.)

We need two letters for positions 1 and 2.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words of the form _ _ C E E:

Let's think of common words ending with ""CEE"". The only common word I can think of is ""PIECE"", but P and I are absent. Other words?

- ""NIECE"": N and I are absent.
- ""FIECE"": not a common word? (maybe a misspelling of fiece, but usually ""fierce"")
- ""Fierce"" is 6 letters.

Actually, ""CEE"" is not a common ending. But we have _ _ C E E, so the last three letters are C, E, E.

Words like:
- ""PEACE"": P and A absent.
- ""BEECH"": B E E C H -> but we need C in position 3? B E E C H: positions 1:B, 2:E, 3:E, 4:C, 5:H -> not matching our pattern (we need position 3:C, 4:E, 5:E).

Our pattern is: position 3:C, 4:E, 5:E. So the last three are ""CEE"".

What words have ""CEE"" at the end? Not many. 

- ""LYCEE"" we already tried, but that's L Y C E E, which we used as a guess and found that L and Y are absent.

But the secret word has the same ending? So it must be a different word.

Perhaps ""OCCEE"" not a word.

""RECCE"": R E C C E -> but R is absent, and it has two C's? R E C C E: positions 1:R (absent), 2:E, 3:C, 4:C, 5:E -> but we need position 4 to be E, not C. And we have position 3:C and position 4:E, so this doesn't match.

Another: ""TECEE"" not a word.

I think I need to consider that the word might be ""PIECE"" but P and I are absent.

Perhaps we missed something. Let me list all 5-letter words ending with ""CEE"".

Common words: 
- ""LYCEE"" is one, but we tried it and L and Y are absent, so the secret word is not LYCEE.

Others? 
- ""DECEE"" not a word.
- ""FECEE"" not.
- ""MECEE"" not.

Perhaps it's a less common word. Or maybe I have the pattern wrong.

Another idea: the feedback from LYCEE showed that position 4 is E and position 5 is E, and position 3 is C. So the secret word must have C in position 3 and E in positions 4 and 5.

So the secret word is ? ? C E E.

Now, what words are there? 

- ""OCCEE"" not a word.
- ""BECEE"" not.
- ""CECEE"" not.

Wait, perhaps ""CEE"" is not common, but let's think of words like ""foresee"" but that's 7 letters.

Another: ""JICEE"" not.

Perhaps ""NICEE"" not.

I recall that ""lycee"" is a word, but we already tried it.

But there is also ""piece"", but P and I are out.

What about ""dice""? 4 letters.

Perhaps we have to consider that the first two letters might form a word with ""CEE"".

Let me search my memory: is there a word like ""ACEE""? No.

Another thought: the word might be ""PEACE"" but P and A are out.

""BEACE"" not a word.

""LEACE"" not.

Perhaps ""THEME"" but that's T H E M E, no C.

I think I need to consider that the secret word might have more than one C? But we have C in position 3, and we don't know about others.

But in the pattern, positions 1 and 2 are unknown.

Let's list possible words: 
- ""OCCUR"" not ending with E.
- ""ACCESS"" 6 letters.

Perhaps ""C"" is only in position 3.

Another idea: ""C"" in position 3, and the word ends with ""EE"", so like ""agree"" but no C.

""flee"" 4 letters.

I think I found one: ""DECEE"" is not, but ""DECOY"" not E.

Perhaps ""RECUR"" not E.

Let's think of words that have C in position 3 and end with E: for example, ""DANCE"" but A and N out.

""ounce"" N out.

""since"" S and I out.

""force"" R out.

""peace"" P and A out.

""niece"" N and I out.

""voice"" I out.

What about ""trace"" R and A out.

All have forbidden letters.

But we have to use available letters.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

So for positions 1 and 2: two letters from these.

And the word must be _ _ C E E.

Is there any word? Let's try:

- B _ C E E: ""BECEE"" not a word.
- D _ C E E: ""DECEE"" not.
- F _ C E E: ""FECEE"" not.
- G _ C E E: ""GECEE"" not.
- H _ C E E: ""HECEE"" not.
- K _ C E E: ""KECEE"" not.
- M _ C E E: ""MECEE"" not.
- O _ C E E: ""OECEE"" not, or ""OCCEE"" not.
- T _ C E E: ""TECEE"" not.
- U _ C E E: ""UECEE"" not.
- V _ C E E: ""VECEE"" not.
- W _ C E E: ""WECEE"" not.
- X _ C E E: ""XECEE"" not.
- Z _ C E E: ""ZECEE"" not.

This is problematic. Perhaps the word is ""CECEE"" but that's not a word.

Maybe I have a mistake. Let's double-check the feedback.

Guess 3: LYCEE -> feedback: L(x) Y(x) C(✓) E(✓) E(✓)

This means:
- The letter in position 3 is C and it is correct (✓).
- The letter in position 4 is E and it is correct (✓).
- The letter in position 5 is E and it is correct (✓).

So the secret word has C at position 3, E at position 4, and E at position 5.

But what about position 4? It is E, which is correct, so the secret word has E at position 4.

But in the first guess, we had E at position 5 correct, but now we know position 4 is also E.

So the secret word has at least two E's: one at 4 and one at 5.

But we need a word that ends with ""CEE"", meaning the last three letters are C, E, E.

But in English, are there any common words that end with ""CEE""? I can only think of ""lycee"", which we tried.

Perhaps it's ""piece"" but P and I are out.

Another possibility: ""recipe"" is 6 letters.

""a piece"" two words.

Perhaps it's a proper noun, but Wordle uses common words.

Maybe I misremembered the feedback.

Another thought: in the feedback for LYCEE, the last two E's are both marked correct, but that doesn't necessarily mean that position 4 is E; it means that the E in position 4 is correct and the E in position 5 is correct. So the secret word has E in position 4 and position 5.

But position 3 is C, so the word has ""C"" at position 3, then ""E"" at 4 and 5.

So the ending is ""CEE"".

But what words have ""CEE"" at positions 3-5?

For example, in ""lycee"", it does.

In ""peace"", it's P-E-A-C-E, so positions: 1:P, 2:E, 3:A, 4:C, 5:E -> not ""CEE"" at 3-5.

In ""piece"": P-I-E-C-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E -> not ""CEE"" at 3-5.

In ""niece"": N-I-E-C-E -> 1:N, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E.

In ""fierce"": F-I-E-R-C-E -> 6 letters.

So for 5-letter words, the only one I know with ""CEE"" at the end is ""lycee"", but we already ruled it out.

Perhaps "" setee"" not, or ""fecit"" not.

I think there might be a mistake. Let's consider that the feedback for LYCEE might indicate that the E in position 4 is correct, but it could be that the secret word has E in position 4, but not necessarily that the letter at position 4 is E in the secret word? No, the feedback for position 4 is E(✓), so it means that the secret word has E at position 4.

Similarly for position 5.

So the secret word has E at position 4 and position 5, and C at position 3.

So it must be ? ? C E E.

Now, if ""lycee"" is the only common word, but L and Y are absent, then perhaps it's a different word.

Another word: ""creche"" is 6 letters.

""cree"" is 4.

Perhaps ""bcee"" not.

I recall that in Wordle, words can be less common, but ""lycee"" is accepted, as we used it.

But the secret word is not ""lycee"" because L and Y are absent.

So what could it be?

Perhaps ""thee"" is 4 letters.

Another idea: maybe the secret word has more than 5 letters? No, it's 5.

Perhaps I have a error in the feedback interpretation.

Let's read the feedback again: ""Guess 3: LYCEE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) Y(x) C(✓) E(✓) E(✓)""

So for position 1: L is not in the word.
Position 2: Y is not in the word.
Position 3: C is correct and in the right position.
Position 4: E is correct and in the right position.
Position 5: E is correct and in the right position.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ C E E

Now, the only 5-letter word I can find that matches this pattern is ""lycee"", but since L and Y are not in the word, it must be another word.

Perhaps ""oxeye"" but that's O X E Y E, not C.

Or ""agape"" not.

Let's search for words ending with ""cee"":

- ""acee"" not.
- ""bcee"" not.
- ""ccee"" not.
- ""dcee"" not.
- ""ecee"" not.
- ""fcee"" not.
- ""gcee"" not.
- ""hcee"" not.
- ""icee"" I is out.
- ""jcee"" not.
- ""kcee"" not.
- ""lcee"" L out.
- ""mcee"" not.
- ""ncee"" N out.
- ""ocee"" not.
- ""pcee"" P out.
- ""qcee"" not.
- ""rcee"" R out.
- ""scee"" S out.
- ""tcee"" not.
- ""ucee"" not.
- ""vcee"" not.
- ""wcee"" not.
- ""xcee"" not.
- ""ycee"" Y out.
- ""zcee"" not.

This is not working. Perhaps the word is ""civie"" but I out and no C in position 3.

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback or my understanding.

Another possibility: the feedback for position 4 and 5 are both E and correct, but in the secret word, position 4 might not be E if there is a double letter? But the feedback says E(✓) for position 4, so it must be E.

Unless the feedback is per position, so if the secret word has only one E, but we have two E's in the guess, then one might be correct position and the other might be dash or something, but here both are check, so the secret word must have E in both position 4 and position 5.

So it has two E's.

But what 5-letter word has the third letter C and fourth and fifth E, and the first two letters are from available letters?

Perhaps ""URCEE"" not a word.

""  "" Let's try ""OCTET"" not E.

I think I have to consider that the secret word might be ""EJECT"" but no C in position 3.

Perhaps ""DECKE"" not.

I recall that ""c'est"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps it's ""perce"" P E R C E -> P and R out.

I think I need to look for words with the pattern __CEE.

Upon searching my knowledge, I can only find ""lycee"". But since it's not that, perhaps it's a different word.

Another word: ""crewe"" C R E W E -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:W, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

""boche"" B O C H E -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:C, 4:H, 5:E -> this has position 3:C, but position 4:H, not E, and position 5:E. So not ending with CEE.

But in our case, position 4 must be E.

So ""boche"" is B O C H E, not matching.

""tache"" T A C H E -> A out.

""dicey"" not E.

I think I found one: ""fesse"" but no C.

Perhaps ""cesse"" C E S S E -> positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:S, 4:S, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

""messe"" same.

""bless"" not E.

Another: ""fecit"" not 5.

I think there's a word ""peece"" which is an archaic spelling of ""piece"", but P is out.

Perhaps in Wordle, they use such words.

But P is absent, so not.

Let's list the constraints again:

- Position 3: C
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: E
- Position 1: must be a letter from available: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z
- Position 2: similarly.

And the word must be valid.

Perhaps ""O give up"" but let's try ""OUNCE"" again, but N out.

""ounce"" is O U N C E -> position 3:N, not C.

Not.

"" since we have position 3:C, position 4:E, position 5:E, the only word I can think of is ""lycee"", but it's not, so perhaps the feedback is wrong or I have a bug.

Another idea: in the feedback for LYCEE, the E in position 4 is marked correct, but it could be that the secret word has E in position 4, but it might be the same E as position 5? But that's fine.

Perhaps the secret word is ""EJECT"" but 5 letters? E J E C T -> positions: 1:E, 2:J, 3:E, 4:C, 5:T -> not.

I think I need to consider that the word might be ""CLEPE"" but C L E P E -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:P, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

""crepe"" C R E P E -> R and P out.

"" grape"" G R A P E -> R, A, P out.

Perhaps ""theme"" T H E M E -> no C.

I think I have to accept that ""lycee"" is the only common word, but since it's not, perhaps it's ""RECCE"" but R out and positions: R E C C E -> position 3:C, position 4:C, not E.

Not matching.

Let's read the feedback string: ""C(✓) E(✓) E(✓)"" for positions 3,4,5.

So for position 4, it's E and correct, so secret has E at 4.

Position 5, E and correct.

So secret has E at 4 and 5.

Position 3, C and correct.

So it must be ? ? C E E.

Perhaps the word is ""OCCUR"" not E.

I recall that ""setee"" is a word, but S out and no C.

Another: ""detox"" not E.

I think I found a possibility: ""cable"" not.

Perhaps ""facle"" not a word.

""manse"" not.

I give up. Let's assume it's a word like ""the"" with ee, but not.

Perhaps ""freece"" not 5.

Another: ""breve"" not C.

I think there's a word ""creme"" C R E M E -> R out.

"" creme"" is C R E M E, so if R is out, not.

But we have available letters, so how about "" CremE"" but C is at position 1, not 3.

Not.

Perhaps the secret word is ""DECEE"" but not a word.

I think I have to make a guess with the available letters.

For example, ""B  C E E"" for positions 1 and 2, but what letter? ""BCEE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""U and V"" but ""UCEE"" not.

Let's try ""TOGEE"" T O G E E -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:G, 4:E, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

Not.

""  "" Or ""COMET"" not E at end.

I think the only logical conclusion is that the secret word is ""lycee"", but since L and Y are absent, it must be that the feedback for LYCEE is for a different word.

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 and 5 are both E, but in the secret word, position 4 might not be E if the E is repeated, but the feedback for position 4 is E(✓), so it must be E.

Unless the secret word has only one E, but we have two in the guess, then one would be correct position and the other might be absent or wrong position, but here both are correct, so it must have two E's.

For example, if the secret word has E only at position 5, then in LYCEE, position 4 E would be not in word or wrong position, but it's marked correct, so it must be in position 4.

So I think there's a word that we are missing.

After research in my mind, I recall that ""lycee"" is the only one, but let's try ""corps"" not.

Another: ""cuppa"" not.

Perhaps ""cease"" C E A S E -> positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

Not.

""lease"" L out.

I think I have to choose a word that fits the pattern with available letters, even if it's not common.

For example, ""DOCEE"" not a word.

"" MOCEE"" not.

"" TECEE"" not.

"" WECEE"" not.

Perhaps ""civvy"" not.

I think for the sake of continuing, let's assume that the secret word is ""lycee"" but since L and Y are absent, it can't be, so perhaps the feedback has a mistake.

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 is not E(✓) but something else, but the user said E(✓).

Let's read the user input: ""Guess 3: LYCEE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) Y(x) C(✓) E(✓) E(✓)""

So it's clear.

Perhaps ""E(✓) E(✓)"" means that both E's are correct, but in the secret word, position 4 might not be E if there is only one E, but then the feedback for position 4 would be dash or something, but it's check, so it must be correct.

For example, if the secret word has E only at position 5, then for LYCEE, position 4 E would be not in the word (since only one E and it's at 5), so it should be x or - if there is another E, but here it's marked ✓, so it must be that position 4 is E in the secret word.

So I think we have to accept that the word is _ _ C E E, and we need to find it.

Perhaps ""queue"" Q U E U E -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:U, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

Not.

""  "" Or ""argue"" not C.

I think I found a word: ""peece"" but P out.

Or ""reccy"" not E.

Another: ""levee"" L out and no C.

I think I need to move on and make a guess with the pattern.

Let's guess ""B  C E E"" but what word? ""BCEE"" not.

Perhaps ""the"" is not.

I recall that in some contexts, ""c ee"" but not.

Perhaps the secret word is ""EERIE"" but no C.

I have an idea: perhaps the feedback for C in LYCEE is correct, but the E in position 4 is not necessarily meaning that position 4 is E, but let's read the rules.

In Wordle, the feedback is per position: for each position, if the letter is correct and in the right position, it's green/✓; if the letter is in the word but wrong position, it's yellow/-; if not in the word, it's grey/x.

For LYCEE:
- Position 3: C is ✓, so secret has C at position 3.
- Position 4: E is ✓, so secret has E at position 4.
- Position 5: E is ✓, so secret has E at position 5.

So no doubt.

Perhaps the word is ""oxeye"" O X E Y E -> positions: 1:O, 2:X, 3:E, 4:Y, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

Not.

""  "" Or ""agate"" not.

I think I have to conclude that the only possibility is a word like ""lycee"", but since it's not, perhaps it's ""fesse"" but no C.

Perhaps ""cesse"" but C at position 1.

I give up. Let's make a guess that tests the first two positions with common letters.

For example, guess ""B  C E E"" but not a word, so we can't.

Another word: ""COMET"" not.

Perhaps ""HOMED"" not.

We know the last three are C E E, so we can guess a word like ""DOCET"" not a word.

""  "" Or ""ROCKY"" not E.

I think for the sake of the game, let's guess ""THEME"" but no C.

Perhaps ""CREAM"" not E.

I recall that ""crepe"" is C R E P E, but R and P out.

So with available letters, how about ""DEME"" not 5.

Perhaps ""CEMEX"" not a word.

I think I have to choose a word that has C in position 3 and E in 4 and 5, and for positions 1 and 2, use two available letters that might form a word.

For example, ""T C E E"" not.

""  "" Or ""O C E E"" not.

Perhaps ""UDCEE"" not.

I found a word: ""chile"" not.

Another: ""boche"" I mentioned, but position 4 is H, not E.

So not.

Perhaps the secret word is ""EJECT"" but 6 letters.

I think there's a mistake; perhaps the feedback for Guess 3 is for a different word.

Perhaps in Guess 3, the feedback for the second E is for position 5, which we know, and position 4 E might be something else, but it's marked ✓.

Let's assume that the word is ""lycee"" and move on, but we can't because L and Y are absent.

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 E(✓) means that E is in the word and in position, but if the secret word has only one E, it can't be in two positions, but here it has two E's in the guess, both marked correct, so secret must have two E's.

But in position 4 and 5.

So I think we have to look for words ending with ""EE"" and C in position 3.

Words ending with ""EE"": agree, فبreeze, etc, but not with C in position 3.

""agree"" A G R E E -> A and R out.

""free"" 4 letters.

""glee"" 4.

"" tree"" 4.

"" 5-letter words ending with EE: 
- agree
- بreeze B R E E Z E 6 letters.
- emcee E M C E E -> positions: 1:E, 2:M, 3:C, 4:E, 5:E -> oh! ""EMMCEE"" not, ""EMMCEE"" is 6? ""emcee"" is 5 letters? E-M-C-E-E.

Yes, ""emcee"" is a valid word: E M C E E.

Positions:
1: E
2: M
3: C
4: E
5: E

This matches the pattern: position 3:C, position 4:E, position 5:E.

And letters: E, M, C, E, E.

Now, check against feedback:

From Guess 1: CRANE had C in position 1, which was dash, but in ""emcee"", C is in position 3, so that's fine. E in position 5 is correct.

From Guess 2: SPICE had C in position 4, which was dash, but in ""emcee"", C is in position 3, not 4, so consistent.

From Guess 3: LYCEE, we have feedback that L and Y are absent, which is fine for ""emcee"" since it has E and M.

Also, in ""emcee"", it has E in position 1, which we didn't know before.

But in Guess 1, we had E only in position 5, so we didn't test position 1.

Now, for ""emcee"", it has E in position 1, which is new.

But in the available letters, E is already known to be in the word, but we don't know about position 1.

Also, M is a new letter.

So ""emcee"" is a possible candidate.

And it uses letters: E, M, C, E, E.

C and E are known, M is new.

Absent letters: R, A, N, S, P, I, L, Y. M is not in that list, so available.

So the secret word could be ""EMMCEE"" but it's 5 letters: E-M-C-E-E.

Yes.

So for the next guess, we can guess ""EMMCEE"" but we have only 5 letters, so ""E M C E E"".

But we have to make a guess.

Since we have only two positions to guess, but we don't know position 1 and 2, but in ""emcee"", it's E and M.

But we can guess it.

Perhaps there are other words, but ""emcee"" is one.

Another word? ""UMCEE"" not.

So I think ""emcee"" is the word.

So for the fourth guess, we can guess ""EMMCEE"" but it's ""E M C E E"".

So guess: EMCEE

But let's confirm the spelling: ""emcee"" is acceptable.

So I'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.
  - R, A, and N are not in the word.
  - E is in the word and in position 5.

- **Guess 2: SPICE → Feedback: S(x) P(x) I(x) C(-) E(✓)**  
  - S, P, and I are not in the word.
  - C is in the word but not in position 4.
  - E is confirmed in position 5.

- **Guess 3: LYCEE → Feedback: L(x) Y(x) C(✓) E(✓) E(✓)**  
  - L and Y are not in the word.
  - C is in the word and in position 3.
  - E is in the word and in position 4.
  - E is in the word and in position 5 (already known).

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Positions**:
   - Position 3: C
   - Position 4: E
   - Position 5: E
   - Therefore, the word pattern is `_ _ C E E`.

2. **Absent Letters**: R, A, N, S, P, I, L, Y (cannot be used).

3. **Present Letters**:
   - C (position 3) and E (positions 4 and 5) are confirmed.
   - E may appear elsewhere (e.g., position 1 or 2), but this is unknown.

4. **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (not yet tested or ruled out).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- The word must match the pattern `_ _ C E E` and use only available letters.
- ""EMMCEE"" (spelled as **EMCEE**) is a valid 5-letter word that fits:
  - Position 1: E (untested; could be present or not, but E is already confirmed at positions 4 and 5).
  - Position 2: M (untested letter).
  - Positions 3-5: C E E (confirmed).
- This guess tests:
  - Whether E is also in position 1 (feedback will confirm).
  - Whether M is in the word and its position (if present).
- If EMCEE is not the secret word, the feedback will provide critical information about positions 1 and 2, narrowing down to the solution.

<guess>EMCEE</guess>",EMCEE,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: dash (-) → C is in the word but not in position 1.
- R: x → not in the word.
- A: x → not in the word.
- N: x → not in the word.
- E: check (✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

Guess 2: SPICE
- S: x → not in the word.
- P: x → not in the word.
- I: x → not in the word.
- C: dash (-) → C is in the word but not in position 4.
- E: check (✓) → E is in position 5 (already known).

Guess 3: LYCEE
- L: x → not in the word.
- Y: x → not in the word.
- C: check (✓) → C is in the word and in position 3.
- E: check (✓) → E is in the word and in position 4? But note: the feedback shows two E's. Let's parse:
  - The feedback is: L(x) Y(x) C(✓) E(✓) E(✓)
  - Since the word is L-Y-C-E-E, positions are:
    - Position 1: L → x
    - Position 2: Y → x
    - Position 3: C → ✓
    - Position 4: E → ✓
    - Position 5: E → ✓

So the feedback for the E's: 
- Position 4: E is correct (✓) → so E is in position 4.
- Position 5: E is correct (✓) → we already knew that.

Therefore, from Guess 3, we have:
- C is in position 3 (✓).
- E is in position 4 (✓) and position 5 (✓).
- L and Y are not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has:
   - Position 3: C
   - Position 4: E
   - Position 5: E

So the word pattern is: _ _ C E E

2. We also know that C is in position 3, and we have two E's: one in position 4 and one in position 5.

3. Absent letters: R, A, N, S, P, I, L, Y.

4. We know that C is present (in position 3) and E is present (in positions 4 and 5). Also, from the first guess, we know that C is not in position 1 (but now we know it's in position 3, so that's consistent).

5. The word must be of the form: _ _ C E E

We need to find the first two letters. They must be from the remaining available letters, avoiding the absent ones.

Available letters (not tried and not absent): B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z. (Note: we have used C, E, R, A, N, S, P, I, L, Y; so the rest are available.)

We need two letters for positions 1 and 2.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words of the form _ _ C E E:

Let's think of common words ending with ""CEE"". The only common word I can think of is ""PIECE"", but P and I are absent. Other words?

- ""NIECE"": N and I are absent.
- ""FIECE"": not a common word? (maybe a misspelling of fiece, but usually ""fierce"")
- ""Fierce"" is 6 letters.

Actually, ""CEE"" is not a common ending. But we have _ _ C E E, so the last three letters are C, E, E.

Words like:
- ""PEACE"": P and A absent.
- ""BEECH"": B E E C H -> but we need C in position 3? B E E C H: positions 1:B, 2:E, 3:E, 4:C, 5:H -> not matching our pattern (we need position 3:C, 4:E, 5:E).

Our pattern is: position 3:C, 4:E, 5:E. So the last three are ""CEE"".

What words have ""CEE"" at the end? Not many. 

- ""LYCEE"" we already tried, but that's L Y C E E, which we used as a guess and found that L and Y are absent.

But the secret word has the same ending? So it must be a different word.

Perhaps ""OCCEE"" not a word.

""RECCE"": R E C C E -> but R is absent, and it has two C's? R E C C E: positions 1:R (absent), 2:E, 3:C, 4:C, 5:E -> but we need position 4 to be E, not C. And we have position 3:C and position 4:E, so this doesn't match.

Another: ""TECEE"" not a word.

I think I need to consider that the word might be ""PIECE"" but P and I are absent.

Perhaps we missed something. Let me list all 5-letter words ending with ""CEE"".

Common words: 
- ""LYCEE"" is one, but we tried it and L and Y are absent, so the secret word is not LYCEE.

Others? 
- ""DECEE"" not a word.
- ""FECEE"" not.
- ""MECEE"" not.

Perhaps it's a less common word. Or maybe I have the pattern wrong.

Another idea: the feedback from LYCEE showed that position 4 is E and position 5 is E, and position 3 is C. So the secret word must have C in position 3 and E in positions 4 and 5.

So the secret word is ? ? C E E.

Now, what words are there? 

- ""OCCEE"" not a word.
- ""BECEE"" not.
- ""CECEE"" not.

Wait, perhaps ""CEE"" is not common, but let's think of words like ""foresee"" but that's 7 letters.

Another: ""JICEE"" not.

Perhaps ""NICEE"" not.

I recall that ""lycee"" is a word, but we already tried it.

But there is also ""piece"", but P and I are out.

What about ""dice""? 4 letters.

Perhaps we have to consider that the first two letters might form a word with ""CEE"".

Let me search my memory: is there a word like ""ACEE""? No.

Another thought: the word might be ""PEACE"" but P and A are out.

""BEACE"" not a word.

""LEACE"" not.

Perhaps ""THEME"" but that's T H E M E, no C.

I think I need to consider that the secret word might have more than one C? But we have C in position 3, and we don't know about others.

But in the pattern, positions 1 and 2 are unknown.

Let's list possible words: 
- ""OCCUR"" not ending with E.
- ""ACCESS"" 6 letters.

Perhaps ""C"" is only in position 3.

Another idea: ""C"" in position 3, and the word ends with ""EE"", so like ""agree"" but no C.

""flee"" 4 letters.

I think I found one: ""DECEE"" is not, but ""DECOY"" not E.

Perhaps ""RECUR"" not E.

Let's think of words that have C in position 3 and end with E: for example, ""DANCE"" but A and N out.

""ounce"" N out.

""since"" S and I out.

""force"" R out.

""peace"" P and A out.

""niece"" N and I out.

""voice"" I out.

What about ""trace"" R and A out.

All have forbidden letters.

But we have to use available letters.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z.

So for positions 1 and 2: two letters from these.

And the word must be _ _ C E E.

Is there any word? Let's try:

- B _ C E E: ""BECEE"" not a word.
- D _ C E E: ""DECEE"" not.
- F _ C E E: ""FECEE"" not.
- G _ C E E: ""GECEE"" not.
- H _ C E E: ""HECEE"" not.
- K _ C E E: ""KECEE"" not.
- M _ C E E: ""MECEE"" not.
- O _ C E E: ""OECEE"" not, or ""OCCEE"" not.
- T _ C E E: ""TECEE"" not.
- U _ C E E: ""UECEE"" not.
- V _ C E E: ""VECEE"" not.
- W _ C E E: ""WECEE"" not.
- X _ C E E: ""XECEE"" not.
- Z _ C E E: ""ZECEE"" not.

This is problematic. Perhaps the word is ""CECEE"" but that's not a word.

Maybe I have a mistake. Let's double-check the feedback.

Guess 3: LYCEE -> feedback: L(x) Y(x) C(✓) E(✓) E(✓)

This means:
- The letter in position 3 is C and it is correct (✓).
- The letter in position 4 is E and it is correct (✓).
- The letter in position 5 is E and it is correct (✓).

So the secret word has C at position 3, E at position 4, and E at position 5.

But what about position 4? It is E, which is correct, so the secret word has E at position 4.

But in the first guess, we had E at position 5 correct, but now we know position 4 is also E.

So the secret word has at least two E's: one at 4 and one at 5.

But we need a word that ends with ""CEE"", meaning the last three letters are C, E, E.

But in English, are there any common words that end with ""CEE""? I can only think of ""lycee"", which we tried.

Perhaps it's ""piece"" but P and I are out.

Another possibility: ""recipe"" is 6 letters.

""a piece"" two words.

Perhaps it's a proper noun, but Wordle uses common words.

Maybe I misremembered the feedback.

Another thought: in the feedback for LYCEE, the last two E's are both marked correct, but that doesn't necessarily mean that position 4 is E; it means that the E in position 4 is correct and the E in position 5 is correct. So the secret word has E in position 4 and position 5.

But position 3 is C, so the word has ""C"" at position 3, then ""E"" at 4 and 5.

So the ending is ""CEE"".

But what words have ""CEE"" at positions 3-5?

For example, in ""lycee"", it does.

In ""peace"", it's P-E-A-C-E, so positions: 1:P, 2:E, 3:A, 4:C, 5:E -> not ""CEE"" at 3-5.

In ""piece"": P-I-E-C-E -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E -> not ""CEE"" at 3-5.

In ""niece"": N-I-E-C-E -> 1:N, 2:I, 3:E, 4:C, 5:E.

In ""fierce"": F-I-E-R-C-E -> 6 letters.

So for 5-letter words, the only one I know with ""CEE"" at the end is ""lycee"", but we already ruled it out.

Perhaps "" setee"" not, or ""fecit"" not.

I think there might be a mistake. Let's consider that the feedback for LYCEE might indicate that the E in position 4 is correct, but it could be that the secret word has E in position 4, but not necessarily that the letter at position 4 is E in the secret word? No, the feedback for position 4 is E(✓), so it means that the secret word has E at position 4.

Similarly for position 5.

So the secret word has E at position 4 and position 5, and C at position 3.

So it must be ? ? C E E.

Now, if ""lycee"" is the only common word, but L and Y are absent, then perhaps it's a different word.

Another word: ""creche"" is 6 letters.

""cree"" is 4.

Perhaps ""bcee"" not.

I recall that in Wordle, words can be less common, but ""lycee"" is accepted, as we used it.

But the secret word is not ""lycee"" because L and Y are absent.

So what could it be?

Perhaps ""thee"" is 4 letters.

Another idea: maybe the secret word has more than 5 letters? No, it's 5.

Perhaps I have a error in the feedback interpretation.

Let's read the feedback again: ""Guess 3: LYCEE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) Y(x) C(✓) E(✓) E(✓)""

So for position 1: L is not in the word.
Position 2: Y is not in the word.
Position 3: C is correct and in the right position.
Position 4: E is correct and in the right position.
Position 5: E is correct and in the right position.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ C E E

Now, the only 5-letter word I can find that matches this pattern is ""lycee"", but since L and Y are not in the word, it must be another word.

Perhaps ""oxeye"" but that's O X E Y E, not C.

Or ""agape"" not.

Let's search for words ending with ""cee"":

- ""acee"" not.
- ""bcee"" not.
- ""ccee"" not.
- ""dcee"" not.
- ""ecee"" not.
- ""fcee"" not.
- ""gcee"" not.
- ""hcee"" not.
- ""icee"" I is out.
- ""jcee"" not.
- ""kcee"" not.
- ""lcee"" L out.
- ""mcee"" not.
- ""ncee"" N out.
- ""ocee"" not.
- ""pcee"" P out.
- ""qcee"" not.
- ""rcee"" R out.
- ""scee"" S out.
- ""tcee"" not.
- ""ucee"" not.
- ""vcee"" not.
- ""wcee"" not.
- ""xcee"" not.
- ""ycee"" Y out.
- ""zcee"" not.

This is not working. Perhaps the word is ""civie"" but I out and no C in position 3.

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback or my understanding.

Another possibility: the feedback for position 4 and 5 are both E and correct, but in the secret word, position 4 might not be E if there is a double letter? But the feedback says E(✓) for position 4, so it must be E.

Unless the feedback is per position, so if the secret word has only one E, but we have two E's in the guess, then one might be correct position and the other might be dash or something, but here both are check, so the secret word must have E in both position 4 and position 5.

So it has two E's.

But what 5-letter word has the third letter C and fourth and fifth E, and the first two letters are from available letters?

Perhaps ""URCEE"" not a word.

""  "" Let's try ""OCTET"" not E.

I think I have to consider that the secret word might be ""EJECT"" but no C in position 3.

Perhaps ""DECKE"" not.

I recall that ""c'est"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps it's ""perce"" P E R C E -> P and R out.

I think I need to look for words with the pattern __CEE.

Upon searching my knowledge, I can only find ""lycee"". But since it's not that, perhaps it's a different word.

Another word: ""crewe"" C R E W E -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:E, 4:W, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

""boche"" B O C H E -> positions: 1:B, 2:O, 3:C, 4:H, 5:E -> this has position 3:C, but position 4:H, not E, and position 5:E. So not ending with CEE.

But in our case, position 4 must be E.

So ""boche"" is B O C H E, not matching.

""tache"" T A C H E -> A out.

""dicey"" not E.

I think I found one: ""fesse"" but no C.

Perhaps ""cesse"" C E S S E -> positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:S, 4:S, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

""messe"" same.

""bless"" not E.

Another: ""fecit"" not 5.

I think there's a word ""peece"" which is an archaic spelling of ""piece"", but P is out.

Perhaps in Wordle, they use such words.

But P is absent, so not.

Let's list the constraints again:

- Position 3: C
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: E
- Position 1: must be a letter from available: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z
- Position 2: similarly.

And the word must be valid.

Perhaps ""O give up"" but let's try ""OUNCE"" again, but N out.

""ounce"" is O U N C E -> position 3:N, not C.

Not.

"" since we have position 3:C, position 4:E, position 5:E, the only word I can think of is ""lycee"", but it's not, so perhaps the feedback is wrong or I have a bug.

Another idea: in the feedback for LYCEE, the E in position 4 is marked correct, but it could be that the secret word has E in position 4, but it might be the same E as position 5? But that's fine.

Perhaps the secret word is ""EJECT"" but 5 letters? E J E C T -> positions: 1:E, 2:J, 3:E, 4:C, 5:T -> not.

I think I need to consider that the word might be ""CLEPE"" but C L E P E -> positions: 1:C, 2:L, 3:E, 4:P, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

""crepe"" C R E P E -> R and P out.

"" grape"" G R A P E -> R, A, P out.

Perhaps ""theme"" T H E M E -> no C.

I think I have to accept that ""lycee"" is the only common word, but since it's not, perhaps it's ""RECCE"" but R out and positions: R E C C E -> position 3:C, position 4:C, not E.

Not matching.

Let's read the feedback string: ""C(✓) E(✓) E(✓)"" for positions 3,4,5.

So for position 4, it's E and correct, so secret has E at 4.

Position 5, E and correct.

So secret has E at 4 and 5.

Position 3, C and correct.

So it must be ? ? C E E.

Perhaps the word is ""OCCUR"" not E.

I recall that ""setee"" is a word, but S out and no C.

Another: ""detox"" not E.

I think I found a possibility: ""cable"" not.

Perhaps ""facle"" not a word.

""manse"" not.

I give up. Let's assume it's a word like ""the"" with ee, but not.

Perhaps ""freece"" not 5.

Another: ""breve"" not C.

I think there's a word ""creme"" C R E M E -> R out.

"" creme"" is C R E M E, so if R is out, not.

But we have available letters, so how about "" CremE"" but C is at position 1, not 3.

Not.

Perhaps the secret word is ""DECEE"" but not a word.

I think I have to make a guess with the available letters.

For example, ""B  C E E"" for positions 1 and 2, but what letter? ""BCEE"" not a word.

Perhaps ""U and V"" but ""UCEE"" not.

Let's try ""TOGEE"" T O G E E -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:G, 4:E, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

Not.

""  "" Or ""COMET"" not E at end.

I think the only logical conclusion is that the secret word is ""lycee"", but since L and Y are absent, it must be that the feedback for LYCEE is for a different word.

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 and 5 are both E, but in the secret word, position 4 might not be E if the E is repeated, but the feedback for position 4 is E(✓), so it must be E.

Unless the secret word has only one E, but we have two in the guess, then one would be correct position and the other might be absent or wrong position, but here both are correct, so it must have two E's.

For example, if the secret word has E only at position 5, then in LYCEE, position 4 E would be not in word or wrong position, but it's marked correct, so it must be in position 4.

So I think there's a word that we are missing.

After research in my mind, I recall that ""lycee"" is the only one, but let's try ""corps"" not.

Another: ""cuppa"" not.

Perhaps ""cease"" C E A S E -> positions: 1:C, 2:E, 3:A, 4:S, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

Not.

""lease"" L out.

I think I have to choose a word that fits the pattern with available letters, even if it's not common.

For example, ""DOCEE"" not a word.

"" MOCEE"" not.

"" TECEE"" not.

"" WECEE"" not.

Perhaps ""civvy"" not.

I think for the sake of continuing, let's assume that the secret word is ""lycee"" but since L and Y are absent, it can't be, so perhaps the feedback has a mistake.

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 is not E(✓) but something else, but the user said E(✓).

Let's read the user input: ""Guess 3: LYCEE -> FEEDBACK: L(x) Y(x) C(✓) E(✓) E(✓)""

So it's clear.

Perhaps ""E(✓) E(✓)"" means that both E's are correct, but in the secret word, position 4 might not be E if there is only one E, but then the feedback for position 4 would be dash or something, but it's check, so it must be correct.

For example, if the secret word has E only at position 5, then for LYCEE, position 4 E would be not in the word (since only one E and it's at 5), so it should be x or - if there is another E, but here it's marked ✓, so it must be that position 4 is E in the secret word.

So I think we have to accept that the word is _ _ C E E, and we need to find it.

Perhaps ""queue"" Q U E U E -> positions: 1:Q, 2:U, 3:E, 4:U, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

Not.

""  "" Or ""argue"" not C.

I think I found a word: ""peece"" but P out.

Or ""reccy"" not E.

Another: ""levee"" L out and no C.

I think I need to move on and make a guess with the pattern.

Let's guess ""B  C E E"" but what word? ""BCEE"" not.

Perhaps ""the"" is not.

I recall that in some contexts, ""c ee"" but not.

Perhaps the secret word is ""EERIE"" but no C.

I have an idea: perhaps the feedback for C in LYCEE is correct, but the E in position 4 is not necessarily meaning that position 4 is E, but let's read the rules.

In Wordle, the feedback is per position: for each position, if the letter is correct and in the right position, it's green/✓; if the letter is in the word but wrong position, it's yellow/-; if not in the word, it's grey/x.

For LYCEE:
- Position 3: C is ✓, so secret has C at position 3.
- Position 4: E is ✓, so secret has E at position 4.
- Position 5: E is ✓, so secret has E at position 5.

So no doubt.

Perhaps the word is ""oxeye"" O X E Y E -> positions: 1:O, 2:X, 3:E, 4:Y, 5:E -> not C in position 3.

Not.

""  "" Or ""agate"" not.

I think I have to conclude that the only possibility is a word like ""lycee"", but since it's not, perhaps it's ""fesse"" but no C.

Perhaps ""cesse"" but C at position 1.

I give up. Let's make a guess that tests the first two positions with common letters.

For example, guess ""B  C E E"" but not a word, so we can't.

Another word: ""COMET"" not.

Perhaps ""HOMED"" not.

We know the last three are C E E, so we can guess a word like ""DOCET"" not a word.

""  "" Or ""ROCKY"" not E.

I think for the sake of the game, let's guess ""THEME"" but no C.

Perhaps ""CREAM"" not E.

I recall that ""crepe"" is C R E P E, but R and P out.

So with available letters, how about ""DEME"" not 5.

Perhaps ""CEMEX"" not a word.

I think I have to choose a word that has C in position 3 and E in 4 and 5, and for positions 1 and 2, use two available letters that might form a word.

For example, ""T C E E"" not.

""  "" Or ""O C E E"" not.

Perhaps ""UDCEE"" not.

I found a word: ""chile"" not.

Another: ""boche"" I mentioned, but position 4 is H, not E.

So not.

Perhaps the secret word is ""EJECT"" but 6 letters.

I think there's a mistake; perhaps the feedback for Guess 3 is for a different word.

Perhaps in Guess 3, the feedback for the second E is for position 5, which we know, and position 4 E might be something else, but it's marked ✓.

Let's assume that the word is ""lycee"" and move on, but we can't because L and Y are absent.

Perhaps the feedback for position 4 E(✓) means that E is in the word and in position, but if the secret word has only one E, it can't be in two positions, but here it has two E's in the guess, both marked correct, so secret must have two E's.

But in position 4 and 5.

So I think we have to look for words ending with ""EE"" and C in position 3.

Words ending with ""EE"": agree, فبreeze, etc, but not with C in position 3.

""agree"" A G R E E -> A and R out.

""free"" 4 letters.

""glee"" 4.

"" tree"" 4.

"" 5-letter words ending with EE: 
- agree
- بreeze B R E E Z E 6 letters.
- emcee E M C E E -> positions: 1:E, 2:M, 3:C, 4:E, 5:E -> oh! ""EMMCEE"" not, ""EMMCEE"" is 6? ""emcee"" is 5 letters? E-M-C-E-E.

Yes, ""emcee"" is a valid word: E M C E E.

Positions:
1: E
2: M
3: C
4: E
5: E

This matches the pattern: position 3:C, position 4:E, position 5:E.

And letters: E, M, C, E, E.

Now, check against feedback:

From Guess 1: CRANE had C in position 1, which was dash, but in ""emcee"", C is in position 3, so that's fine. E in position 5 is correct.

From Guess 2: SPICE had C in position 4, which was dash, but in ""emcee"", C is in position 3, not 4, so consistent.

From Guess 3: LYCEE, we have feedback that L and Y are absent, which is fine for ""emcee"" since it has E and M.

Also, in ""emcee"", it has E in position 1, which we didn't know before.

But in Guess 1, we had E only in position 5, so we didn't test position 1.

Now, for ""emcee"", it has E in position 1, which is new.

But in the available letters, E is already known to be in the word, but we don't know about position 1.

Also, M is a new letter.

So ""emcee"" is a possible candidate.

And it uses letters: E, M, C, E, E.

C and E are known, M is new.

Absent letters: R, A, N, S, P, I, L, Y. M is not in that list, so available.

So the secret word could be ""EMMCEE"" but it's 5 letters: E-M-C-E-E.

Yes.

So for the next guess, we can guess ""EMMCEE"" but we have only 5 letters, so ""E M C E E"".

But we have to make a guess.

Since we have only two positions to guess, but we don't know position 1 and 2, but in ""emcee"", it's E and M.

But we can guess it.

Perhaps there are other words, but ""emcee"" is one.

Another word? ""UMCEE"" not.

So I think ""emcee"" is the word.

So for the fourth guess, we can guess ""EMMCEE"" but it's ""E M C E E"".

So guess: EMCEE

But let's confirm the spelling: ""emcee"" is acceptable.

So I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE → Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(✓)**  
  - C is in the word but not in position 1.
  - R, A, and N are not in the word.
  - E is in the word and in position 5.

- **Guess 2: SPICE → Feedback: S(x) P(x) I(x) C(-) E(✓)**  
  - S, P, and I are not in the word.
  - C is in the word but not in position 4.
  - E is confirmed in position 5.

- **Guess 3: LYCEE → Feedback: L(x) Y(x) C(✓) E(✓) E(✓)**  
  - L and Y are not in the word.
  - C is in the word and in position 3.
  - E is in the word and in position 4.
  - E is in the word and in position 5 (already known).

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Positions**:
   - Position 3: C
   - Position 4: E
   - Position 5: E
   - Therefore, the word pattern is `_ _ C E E`.

2. **Absent Letters**: R, A, N, S, P, I, L, Y (cannot be used).

3. **Present Letters**:
   - C (position 3) and E (positions 4 and 5) are confirmed.
   - E may appear elsewhere (e.g., position 1 or 2), but this is unknown.

4. **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, O, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Z (not yet tested or ruled out).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- The word must match the pattern `_ _ C E E` and use only available letters.
- ""EMMCEE"" (spelled as **EMCEE**) is a valid 5-letter word that fits:
  - Position 1: E (untested; could be present or not, but E is already confirmed at positions 4 and 5).
  - Position 2: M (untested letter).
  - Positions 3-5: C E E (confirmed).
- This guess tests:
