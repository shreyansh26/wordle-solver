 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the second position of ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

For the next guess, we should:
- Avoid using the letters C, A, N, E.
- Include the letter R (since we know it's in the word) and place it in a different position than the second (because in ""crane"" it was in position 2 and that was wrong).
- Use other common letters that haven't been tried yet to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know R is in the word, so we should try to put R in a position that we haven't tried. Since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also want to cover other common vowels and consonants. The vowels we haven't tried are: I, O, U (since A and E are out). We should include one of these.

A good strategy is to pick a word that has R and also includes other common letters.

Let's consider some words that fit:
- Must have R, and avoid C, A, N, E.
- We can try words like ""ROTIS"", but that's not a word. We need valid English words.

Common words:
- ""ROBOT"" - but has O and T, but also has B and O. However, it has two O's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? But in this case, the secret word might not have duplicates. However, we don't know. But in our feedback, we only have one R so far, so we don't know.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed only R was present. So if the word had two R's, we would have seen two '-' or one correct? Actually, no: if there is only one R in the secret word and we have one R in the guess, we get one '-'. If there were two R's, and one is in the correct position, then we would get a '✓' for that one. But if both are misplaced, we would get two '-'. In this case, we only have one R in the guess and we got one '-', so the secret word has at least one R.

But we don't know if it has more. So we should avoid using duplicate letters for now to not waste a guess.

So, let's pick a word with R and four new letters.

Possible words:
- ""ROILS"" - meaning to agitate liquid. But we don't know if S is in the word? We can try.
- ""ROBIN"" - but N is out (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.
- ""ROWDY"" - has R, O, W, D, Y. All new letters.

But we must avoid A, C, E, N. So ""ROWDY"" is okay.

Another option: ""SPRIG"" - but S, P, R, I, G. However, R is in the third position? But we have R in the word, and we want to try a different position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2. So in ""SPRIG"", R is in position 3. That might be good.

But note: we also have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.

Let me think of words that have R and avoid the forbidden letters.

List of common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, D, H, etc.

I think ""ROWDY"" is a valid word and uses R, O, W, D, Y. All new.

Another one: ""TRIED"" - but E is out, so we cannot use E.

""TRIED"" has E, which is not allowed.

""PROUD"" - has P, R, O, U, D. Avoids the forbidden letters.

""PROUD"" is a good candidate.

""SPORT"" - has S, P, O, R, T. R is in the fourth position? In ""crane"", R was in position 2, so trying position 4 is different.

But we want to test R in a different position. Also, we want to test other common letters.

Another idea: since we know R is in the word, and we have 5 positions, we can try R in position 1.

For example: ""RUSTY"" - has R, U, S, T, Y. Avoids forbidden letters.

""RUSTY"" is a good word.

We can also try ""ROAST"" - but A is out, so we cannot use A.

So, ""ROAST"" is invalid because of A.

""ROBOT"" - has O twice? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can use it? Actually, the word ""robot"" is valid, but we are avoiding duplicates for now to get more information.

But let's not use duplicates. So ""ROBOT"" has two O's, so we might be wasting a letter slot.

Better to use all distinct letters.

So, let's choose between ""ROWDY"", ""PROUD"", ""RUSTY"", ""SPRIG"".

I think ""RUSTY"" is a good choice because:
- It has R in position 1 (which we haven't tried)
- It has U (a vowel we haven't tried) and S, T, Y (common consonants)

Alternatively, ""SPRIG"" has R in position 3, which is also a new position.

But ""SPRIG"" has S, P, R, I, G. I is a vowel we haven't tried.

Both are good.

I'll go with ""RUSTY"" because it tests R in the first position and uses common letters.

So, second guess: ""RUSTY""

But note: we must output in the format.

Let me confirm: we are to output <guess>rusty</guess>

But wait, we have to think: if R is in the secret word, and we put it in position 1, we might get:
- If R is actually in position 1, we get a '✓'
- If not, we get a '-' (if it's in another position) or if it's not in position 1 but present, we get '-'.

But we already know R is in the word, so we are testing the position.

Also, we get information about U, S, T, Y.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, I'll go with ""RUSTY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Avoid C, A, N, E.
- Include R in a new position (not position 2) to test its location.
- Use new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, U, Y).

A strong second guess is ""rusty"" because:
- It places R in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters (U, S, T, Y) not yet tried.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information potential.

But we already know R is in the word, so we are testing the position.

Also, we get information about U, S, T, Y.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, I'll go with ""RUSTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Avoid C, A, N, E.
- Include R in a new position (not position 2) to test its location.
- Use new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, U, Y).

A strong second guess is ""rusty"" because:
- It places R in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters (U, S, T, Y) not yet tried.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information potential.

Since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also want to cover other common vowels and consonants. The vowels we haven\'t tried are: I, O, U (since A and E are out). We should include one of these.\n\nA good strategy is to pick a word that has R and also includes other common letters.\n\nLet\'s consider some words that fit:\n- Must have R, and avoid C, A, N, E.\n- We can try words like ""ROTIS"", but that\'s not a word. We need valid English words.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""ROBOT"" - but has O and T, but also has B and O. However, it has two O\'s and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? But in this case, the secret word might not have duplicates. However, we don\'t know. But in our feedback, we only have one R so far, so we don\'t know.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed only R was present. So if the word had two R\'s, we would have seen two \'-\' or one correct? Actually, no: if there is only one R in the secret word and we have one R in the guess, we get one \'-\'. If there were two R\'s, and one is in the correct position, then we would get a \'✓\' for that one. But if both are misplaced, we would get two \'-\'. In this case, we only have one R in the guess and we got one \'-\', so the secret word has at least one R.\n\nBut we don\'t know if it has more. So we should avoid using duplicate letters for now to not waste a guess.\n\nSo, let\'s pick a word with R and four new letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""ROILS"" - meaning to agitate liquid. But we don\'t know if S is in the word? We can try.\n- ""ROBIN"" - but N is out (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n- ""ROWDY"" - has R, O, W, D, Y. All new letters.\n\nBut we must avoid A, C, E, N. So ""ROWDY"" is okay.\n\nAnother option: ""SPRIG"" - but S, P, R, I, G. However, R is in the third position? But we have R in the word, and we want to try a different position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2. So in ""SPRIG"", R is in position 3. That might be good.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nList of common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, D, H, etc.\n\nI think ""ROWDY"" is a valid word and uses R, O, W, D, Y. All new.\n\nAnother one: ""TRIED"" - but E is out, so we cannot use E.\n\n""TRIED"" has E, which is not allowed.\n\n""PROUD"" - has P, R, O, U, D. Avoids the forbidden letters.\n\n""PROUD"" is a good candidate.\n\n""SPORT"" - has S, P, O, R, T. R is in the fourth position? In ""crane"", R was in position 2, so trying position 4 is different.\n\nBut we want to test R in a different position. Also, we want to test other common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know R is in the word, and we have 5 positions, we can try R in position 1.\n\nFor example: ""RUSTY"" - has R, U, S, T, Y. Avoids forbidden letters.\n\n""RUSTY"" is a good word.\n\nWe can also try ""ROAST"" - but A is out, so we cannot use A.\n\nSo, ""ROAST"" is invalid because of A.\n\n""ROBOT"" - has O twice? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But we can use it? Actually, the word ""robot"" is valid, but we are avoiding duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nBut let\'s not use duplicates. So ""ROBOT"" has two O\'s, so we might be wasting a letter slot.\n\nBetter to use all distinct letters.\n\nSo, let\'s choose between ""ROWDY"", ""PROUD"", ""RUSTY"", ""SPRIG"".\n\nI think ""RUSTY"" is a good choice because:\n- It has R in position 1 (which we haven\'t tried)\n- It has U (a vowel we haven\'t tried) and S, T, Y (common consonants)\n\nAlternatively, ""SPRIG"" has R in position 3, which is also a new position.\n\nBut ""SPRIG"" has S, P, R, I, G. I is a vowel we haven\'t tried.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nI\'ll go with ""RUSTY"" because it tests R in the first position and uses common letters.\n\nSo, second guess: ""RUSTY""\n\nBut note: we must output in the format.\n\nLet me confirm: we are to output <guess>rusty</guess>\n\nBut wait, we have to think: if R is in the secret word, and we put it in position 1, we might get:\n- If R is actually in position 1, we get a \'✓\'\n- If not, we get a \'-\' (if it\'s in another position) or if it\'s not in position 1 but present, we get \'-\'.\n\nBut we already know R is in the word, so we are testing the position.\n\nAlso, we get information about U, S, T, Y.\n\nSo, I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""RUSTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid C, A, N, E.\n- Include R in a new position (not position 2) to test its location.\n- Use new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, U, Y).\n\nA strong second guess is ""rusty"" because:\n- It places R in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces new common letters (U, S, T, Y) not yet tried.\n- All letters are distinct, maximizing information potential.\n\n<guess>rusty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(x) S(-) T(-) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 but wrong position).
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

From Guess 2: ""rusty"" -> R(-) U(x) S(-) T(-) Y(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (since guessed at position 1 and got '-' meaning present but wrong position).
- U and Y are not in the word at all.
- S and T are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively (since S was at position 3 and T at position 4 in ""rusty"").

Combining the feedback:
- The secret word contains R, S, and T (since both S and T are marked as present).
- It does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, Y.

Also, from Guess 1, R was not in position 2, and from Guess 2, R is not in position 1. So R is in the word, but not in position 1 or 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, S was guessed at position 3 (in ""rusty"") and was marked wrong position, so S is not in position 3. T was guessed at position 4 and marked wrong position, so T is not in position 4.

We have not tested position 5 yet (in terms of R, S, T placement).

We need a word that:
- Contains R, S, T
- Does not contain C, A, N, E, U, Y
- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5
- S is not in position 3 (but can be in others)
- T is not in position 4 (but can be in others)

Also, since S and T are in the word, we need to place them in positions not yet ruled out.

Possible positions:
For R: positions 3,4,5
For S: positions 1,2,4,5 (since not position 3)
For T: positions 1,2,3,5 (since not position 4)

We also need to fill the other two letters with letters not yet tried and not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, A, E, N, U, Y (from the feedback)

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others, but common letters)

We should aim for a word that fits the constraints and uses common letters to test more possibilities.

Since R must be in position 3,4, or 5, and we want to test its position, we can try to place R in position 3 and S and T accordingly.

Moreover, we know there are three confirmed letters: R, S, T.

The word has 5 letters, so two more letters are unknown.

Let us try to think of words that contain R, S, T and don't use the excluded letters.

Some possibilities:
- Words with R in position 3: e.g., _ _ R _ _
  - Possible words: ""BIRDS"" but D is allowed? Yes, but ""BIRDS"" has D and S (S at position 5). Also, we need T? ""BIRDS"" does not have T. So not.
  - We need a word that has R, S, T. For example: ""TRIES"" but note E is excluded, so not allowed.
  - ""FIRST"" - let's check:
    - F, I, R, S, T. Does it use excluded letters? E? No. U? No. Excluded are C,A,E,N,U,Y so F,I,R,S,T are all allowed.
    - Positions in ""FIRST"": F(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5)
    - But we know S cannot be in position 3? In ""FIRST"", S is in position 4, which is okay because we only know S is not in position 3. Similarly, T is in position 5: not position 4, so okay.
    - Also, R is in position 3: which is one of the possible positions. But note: in ""rusty"", we had T in position 4 and it was '-', meaning T is in the word but not position 4. In ""FIRST"", T is in position 5, which is fine.

However, we need to check against the feedback: in ""rusty"", S was tried in position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. But in ""FIRST"", we are putting S in position 4. Also, T in position 5.

But the secret word could be ""FIRST""? We need to verify the R position: R must be in 3,4,5. Here it is in 3.

Now, let's see if there is conflicting feedback: in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and wrong. In ""rusty"", R was in position 1 and wrong. In ""FIRST"", R in position 3: we don't know yet.

Another candidate: what about R in position 4? E.g., ""WORST"" but W,O,R,S,T - no excluded letters? Yes. And positions: W(1), O(2), R(3? wait no: ""WORST"" is W-O-R-S-T, so R at position 3? Same as ""FIRST"". Actually, ""WORST"" has R at position 3 as well.

How about a word with R at position 4? E.g., ""_ _ _ R _""
- Like ""BOARS"" but A is excluded? A cannot be used. So not.
- ""FORTs"" - not 5 letters? ""FORTS"" is 5 letters: F,O,R,T,S. R is in position 3? Again position 3.

Actually, it's hard to find words with R in position 4 or 5 that also contain S and T.

What about ""STRAW""? S,T,R,A,W - but A is excluded.

""START"" - S,T,A,R,T - but A excluded and duplicate T? But A is out.

What about ""STRIP"" - S,T,R,I,P. Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). R in position 3.

Similarly, ""STRAP"" - but A is out.

Another idea: R at position 5? E.g., ""_ _ _ _ R"", and also containing S and T. E.g., ""DEMUR"" but D,E,M,U,R - E and U are excluded. Not.

""MINOR"" - M,I,N,O,R: but N is excluded. No.

So it seems that words with R in position 3 are common for R,S,T words.

Another candidate: ""THREE"" but E is excluded, and duplicate E? Not allowed.

""SHORT"" - S,H,O,R,T. No excluded letters: S(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). Ah, here R is in position 4.

Yes: ""SHORT"" has R in position 4.

Now, check positions:
- S is in position 1: is that okay? We only know S is not in position 3 (from rusty). Position 1 is not ruled out.
- H: not tried before, so possible.
- O: not tried, okay.
- R: in position 4, which is allowed (since not position 1 or 2).
- T: in position 5. We know T is in the word and not in position 4 (from rusty), so position 5 is okay.

Also, no excluded letters: S,H,O,R,T — H,O not excluded.

Now, is H,O allowed? Excluded are C,A,E,N,U,Y, so H and O are fine.

Another candidate: ""SPORTS"" is 6 letters, too long.

""PORTS"" - P,O,R,T,S. Positions: P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). But in this word, T is in position 4. However, from feedback: in ""rusty"", T was guessed at position 4 and got a '-' meaning T is present but not in position 4. Therefore, T cannot be in position 4 in the secret word. So if we guess ""PORTS"", T would be at position 4, which is invalid (because secret word cannot have T there). So we cannot use ""PORTS"".

But in ""SHORT"", T is at position 5, not 4.

Another candidate: ""TROUS"" — not a word.

""TRIPS"" - T,R,I,P,S. R in position 3: T(1), R(2)? Wait: T-R-I-P-S: so R at position 2? But we know R cannot be in position 2 (from crane). Because in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and gave a '-', which means R is in the word but not position 2. Therefore, we cannot have R in position 2 in any guess? Actually, we know from feedback that position 2 is wrong for R, so the secret word does not have R in position 2. Therefore, any guess should not put R in position 2 if we know it's incorrect? Actually, in a guess we can put it anywhere to test, but we know it's not position 2, so it won't be correct there. But for efficiency, we should avoid position 2 for R.

In ""TRIPS"", R is in position 2, which we know is incorrect, so it might not be optimal. Instead, we should try a word that tests R in a new position (like 4 or 5) to gather information.

We have tried position 1 and 2 for R and both wrong, so R must be in 3,4,5.

In ""SHORT"", R is in position 4. This tests position 4.

Similarly, S and T are also placed: S in position 1, T in position 5.

We have not tested position 3 for S? We know S is not in position 3 (from rusty feedback), so we can place S elsewhere.

In ""SHORT"", S is in position 1, which hasn't been tested for S before.

Similarly, T is in position 5, not 4.

Also, we introduce H and O, which are new.

Now, let's compare ""SHORT"" and ""FIRST"". ""FIRST"" has R in position 3. Both seem possible.

We could also consider a word with R at position 5? For example, ""STORE"" but E is excluded. Not.

""STORK"" - S,T,O,R,K: positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),R(4),K(5)

So R in position 4 again? Actually, R is in position 4? S-T-O-R-K: R at position 4.

In terms of letter testing, ""STORK"" has K, which is a consonant.

But ""SHORT"" uses H and O.

I think ""SHORT"" is a good choice because:
- It tests R in position 4 (we haven't tried this position yet)
- S in position 1 and T in position 5 (new positions for them)
- H and O are new letters

Alternatively, we could try a word that places S and T in different positions to cover more.

But note: we only have 4 guesses left (if needed).

So I'll go with ""SHORT"".

But let's make sure about the feedback: if we guess ""SHORT"", what feedback would we expect if the secret word is, say, ""brisk""? But we don't know.

But we are trying to get as much information as possible.

Another constraint: the secret word does not have U, Y, etc.

So, I think ""SHORT"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, third guess: ""SHORT""

<guess>short</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From ""crane"": R is present (not position 2), and C, A, N, E are absent.
- From ""rusty"": R is present (not position 1), U and Y are absent, and S and T are present (not positions 3 and 4, respectively).

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters in Secret Word**: R, S, T.
2. **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, U, Y.
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (so it must be in 3, 4, or 5).
   - S cannot be in position 3.
   - T cannot be in position 4.
4. **Available Letters**: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z are untried/not excluded. Focus on common letters (e.g., H, O, I).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test R in position 4** (untried position) to gather information on its exact placement.
- Avoid excluded letters and position constraints for S and T.
- Include new common letters like H and O for broader coverage.
- **Selected Guess: ""SHORT""**:
  - S in position 1 (never tested; S cannot be in 3 but other positions are possible).
  - H and O are new letters to test.
  - R in position 4 (new position to confirm/rule out).
  - T in position 5 (never tested; avoids position 4).
- This guess efficiently tests new positions and letters while adhering to constraints.

<guess>short</guess>",short,"We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 but wrong position).
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

From Guess 2: ""rusty"" -> R(-) U(x) S(-) T(-) Y(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (since guessed at position 1 and got '-' meaning present but wrong position).
- U and Y are not in the word at all.
- S and T are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively (since S was at position 3 and T at position 4 in ""rusty"").

Combining the feedback:
- The secret word contains R, S, and T (since both S and T are marked as present).
- It does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, Y.

Also, from Guess 1, R was not in position 2, and from Guess 2, R is not in position 1. So R is in the word, but not in position 1 or 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, S was guessed at position 3 (in ""rusty"") and was marked wrong position, so S is not in position 3. T was guessed at position 4 and marked wrong position, so T is not in position 4.

We have not tested position 5 yet (in terms of R, S, T placement).

We need a word that:
- Contains R, S, T
- Does not contain C, A, N, E, U, Y
- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5
- S is not in position 3 (but can be in others)
- T is not in position 4 (but can be in others)

Also, since S and T are in the word, we need to place them in positions not yet ruled out.

Possible positions:
For R: positions 3,4,5
For S: positions 1,2,4,5 (since not position 3)
For T: positions 1,2,3,5 (since not position 4)

We also need to fill the other two letters with letters not yet tried and not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, A, E, N, U, Y (from the feedback)

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others, but common letters)

We should aim for a word that fits the constraints and uses common letters to test more possibilities.

Since R must be in position 3,4, or 5, and we want to test its position, we can try to place R in position 3 and S and T accordingly.

Moreover, we know there are three confirmed letters: R, S, T.

The word has 5 letters, so two more letters are unknown.

Let us try to think of words that contain R, S, T and don't use the excluded letters.

Some possibilities:
- Words with R in position 3: e.g., _ _ R _ _
  - Possible words: ""BIRDS"" but D is allowed? Yes, but ""BIRDS"" has D and S (S at position 5). Also, we need T? ""BIRDS"" does not have T. So not.
  - We need a word that has R, S, T. For example: ""TRIES"" but note E is excluded, so not allowed.
  - ""FIRST"" - let's check:
    - F, I, R, S, T. Does it use excluded letters? E? No. U? No. Excluded are C,A,E,N,U,Y so F,I,R,S,T are all allowed.
    - Positions in ""FIRST"": F(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5)
    - But we know S cannot be in position 3? In ""FIRST"", S is in position 4, which is okay because we only know S is not in position 3. Similarly, T is in position 5: not position 4, so okay.
    - Also, R is in position 3: which is one of the possible positions. But note: in ""rusty"", we had T in position 4 and it was '-', meaning T is in the word but not position 4. In ""FIRST"", T is in position 5, which is fine.

However, we need to check against the feedback: in ""rusty"", S was tried in position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. But in ""FIRST"", we are putting S in position 4. Also, T in position 5.

But the secret word could be ""FIRST""? We need to verify the R position: R must be in 3,4,5. Here it is in 3.

Now, let's see if there is conflicting feedback: in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and wrong. In ""rusty"", R was in position 1 and wrong. In ""FIRST"", R in position 3: we don't know yet.

Another candidate: what about R in position 4? E.g., ""WORST"" but W,O,R,S,T - no excluded letters? Yes. And positions: W(1), O(2), R(3? wait no: ""WORST"" is W-O-R-S-T, so R at position 3? Same as ""FIRST"". Actually, ""WORST"" has R at position 3 as well.

How about a word with R at position 4? E.g., ""_ _ _ R _""
- Like ""BOARS"" but A is excluded? A cannot be used. So not.
- ""FORTs"" - not 5 letters? ""FORTS"" is 5 letters: F,O,R,T,S. R is in position 3? Again position 3.

Actually, it's hard to find words with R in position 4 or 5 that also contain S and T.

What about ""STRAW""? S,T,R,A,W - but A is excluded.

""START"" - S,T,A,R,T - but A excluded and duplicate T? But A is out.

What about ""STRIP"" - S,T,R,I,P. Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). R in position 3.

Similarly, ""STRAP"" - but A is out.

Another idea: R at position 5? E.g., ""_ _ _ _ R"", and also containing S and T. E.g., ""DEMUR"" but D,E,M,U,R - E and U are excluded. Not.

""MINOR"" - M,I,N,O,R: but N is excluded. No.

So it seems that words with R in position 3 are common for R,S,T words.

Another candidate: ""THREE"" but E is excluded, and duplicate E? Not allowed.

""SHORT"" - S,H,O,R,T. No excluded letters: S(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). Ah, here R is in position 4.

Yes: ""SHORT"" has R in position 4.

Now, check positions:
- S is in position 1: is that okay? We only know S is not in position 3 (from rusty). Position 1 is not ruled out.
- H: not tried before, so possible.
- O: not tried, okay.
- R: in position 4, which is allowed (since not position 1 or 2).
- T: in position 5. We know T is in the word and not in position 4 (from rusty), so position 5 is okay.

Also, no excluded letters: S,H,O,R,T — H,O not excluded.

Now, is H,O allowed? Excluded are C,A,E,N,U,Y, so H and O are fine.

Another candidate: ""SPORTS"" is 6 letters, too long.

""PORTS"" - P,O,R,T,S. Positions: P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). But in this word, T is in position 4. However, from feedback: in ""rusty"", T was guessed at position 4 and got a '-' meaning T is present but not in position 4. Therefore, T cannot be in position 4 in the secret word. So if we guess ""PORTS"", T would be at position 4, which is invalid (because secret word cannot have T there). So we cannot use ""PORTS"".

But in ""SHORT"", T is at position 5, not 4.

Another candidate: ""TROUS"" — not a word.

""TRIPS"" - T,R,I,P,S. R in position 3: T(1), R(2)? Wait: T-R-I-P-S: so R at position 2? But we know R cannot be in position 2 (from crane). Because in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and gave a '-', which means R is in the word but not position 2. Therefore, we cannot have R in position 2 in any guess? Actually, we know from feedback that position 2 is wrong for R, so the secret word does not have R in position 2. Therefore, any guess should not put R in position 2 if we know it's incorrect? Actually, in a guess we can put it anywhere to test, but we know it's not position 2, so it won't be correct there. But for efficiency, we should avoid position 2 for R.

In ""TRIPS"", R is in position 2, which we know is incorrect, so it might not be optimal. Instead, we should try a word that tests R in a new position (like 4 or 5) to gather information.

We have tried position 1 and 2 for R and both wrong, so R must be in 3,4,5.

In ""SHORT"", R is in position 4. This tests position 4.

Similarly, S and T are also placed: S in position 1, T in position 5.

We have not tested position 3 for S? We know S is not in position 3 (from rusty feedback), so we can place S elsewhere.

In ""SHORT"", S is in position 1, which hasn't been tested for S before.

Similarly, T is in position 5, not 4.

Also, we introduce H and O, which are new.

Now, let's compare ""SHORT"" and ""FIRST"". ""FIRST"" has R in position 3. Both seem possible.

We could also consider a word with R at position 5? For example, ""STORE"" but E is excluded. Not.

""STORK"" - S,T,O,R,K: positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),R(4),K(5)

So R in position 4 again? Actually, R is in position 4? S-T-O-R-K: R at position 4.

In terms of letter testing, ""STORK"" has K, which is a consonant.

But ""SHORT"" uses H and O.

I think ""SHORT"" is a good choice because:
- It tests R in position 4 (we haven't tried this position yet)
- S in position 1 and T in position 5 (new positions for them)
- H and O are new letters

Alternatively, we could try a word that places S and T in different positions to cover more.

But note: we only have 4 guesses left (if needed).

So I'll go with ""SHORT"".

But let's make sure about the feedback: if we guess ""SHORT"", what feedback would we expect if the secret word is, say, ""brisk""? But we don't know.

But we are trying to get as much information as possible.

Another constraint: the secret word does not have U, Y, etc.

So, I think ""SHORT"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, third guess: ""SHORT""

<guess>short</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From ""crane"": R is present (not position 2), and C, A, N, E are absent.
- From ""rusty"": R is present (not position 1), U and Y are absent, and S and T are present (not positions 3 and 4, respectively).

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters in Secret Word**: R, S, T.
2. **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, U, Y.
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (so it must be in 3, 4, or 5).
   - S cannot be in position 3.
   - T cannot be in position 4.
4. **Available Letters**: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z are untried/not excluded. Focus on common letters (e.g., H, O, I).

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Test R in position 4** (untried position) to gather information on its exact placement.
- Avoid excluded letters and position constraints for S and T.
- Include new common letters like H and O for broader coverage.
- **Selected Guess: ""SHORT""**:
  - S in position 1 (never tested; S cannot be in 3 but other positions are possible).
  - H and O are new letters to test.
  - R in position 4 (new position to confirm/rule out).
  - T in position 5 (never tested; avoids position 4).
- This guess efficiently tests new positions and letters while adhering to constraints.",Guess 3: short -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SPORT,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the second position of ""crane"" and got a '-', meaning it's present but not there).
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.

We have 5 more guesses (since we used one).

For the next guess, we should:
- Avoid using the letters C, A, N, E.
- Include the letter R (since we know it's in the word) and place it in a different position than the second (because in ""crane"" it was in position 2 and that was wrong).
- Use other common letters that haven't been tried yet to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We know R is in the word, so we should try to put R in a position that we haven't tried. Since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We also want to cover other common vowels and consonants. The vowels we haven't tried are: I, O, U (since A and E are out). We should include one of these.

A good strategy is to pick a word that has R and also includes other common letters.

Let's consider some words that fit:
- Must have R, and avoid C, A, N, E.
- We can try words like ""ROTIS"", but that's not a word. We need valid English words.

Common words:
- ""ROBOT"" - but has O and T, but also has B and O. However, it has two O's and we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? But in this case, the secret word might not have duplicates. However, we don't know. But in our feedback, we only have one R so far, so we don't know.

But note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed only R was present. So if the word had two R's, we would have seen two '-' or one correct? Actually, no: if there is only one R in the secret word and we have one R in the guess, we get one '-'. If there were two R's, and one is in the correct position, then we would get a '✓' for that one. But if both are misplaced, we would get two '-'. In this case, we only have one R in the guess and we got one '-', so the secret word has at least one R.

But we don't know if it has more. So we should avoid using duplicate letters for now to not waste a guess.

So, let's pick a word with R and four new letters.

Possible words:
- ""ROILS"" - meaning to agitate liquid. But we don't know if S is in the word? We can try.
- ""ROBIN"" - but N is out (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.
- ""ROWDY"" - has R, O, W, D, Y. All new letters.

But we must avoid A, C, E, N. So ""ROWDY"" is okay.

Another option: ""SPRIG"" - but S, P, R, I, G. However, R is in the third position? But we have R in the word, and we want to try a different position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2. So in ""SPRIG"", R is in position 3. That might be good.

But note: we also have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.

Let me think of words that have R and avoid the forbidden letters.

List of common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, D, H, etc.

I think ""ROWDY"" is a valid word and uses R, O, W, D, Y. All new.

Another one: ""TRIED"" - but E is out, so we cannot use E.

""TRIED"" has E, which is not allowed.

""PROUD"" - has P, R, O, U, D. Avoids the forbidden letters.

""PROUD"" is a good candidate.

""SPORT"" - has S, P, O, R, T. R is in the fourth position? In ""crane"", R was in position 2, so trying position 4 is different.

But we want to test R in a different position. Also, we want to test other common letters.

Another idea: since we know R is in the word, and we have 5 positions, we can try R in position 1.

For example: ""RUSTY"" - has R, U, S, T, Y. Avoids forbidden letters.

""RUSTY"" is a good word.

We can also try ""ROAST"" - but A is out, so we cannot use A.

So, ""ROAST"" is invalid because of A.

""ROBOT"" - has O twice? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. But we can use it? Actually, the word ""robot"" is valid, but we are avoiding duplicates for now to get more information.

But let's not use duplicates. So ""ROBOT"" has two O's, so we might be wasting a letter slot.

Better to use all distinct letters.

So, let's choose between ""ROWDY"", ""PROUD"", ""RUSTY"", ""SPRIG"".

I think ""RUSTY"" is a good choice because:
- It has R in position 1 (which we haven't tried)
- It has U (a vowel we haven't tried) and S, T, Y (common consonants)

Alternatively, ""SPRIG"" has R in position 3, which is also a new position.

But ""SPRIG"" has S, P, R, I, G. I is a vowel we haven't tried.

Both are good.

I'll go with ""RUSTY"" because it tests R in the first position and uses common letters.

So, second guess: ""RUSTY""

But note: we must output in the format.

Let me confirm: we are to output <guess>rusty</guess>

But wait, we have to think: if R is in the secret word, and we put it in position 1, we might get:
- If R is actually in position 1, we get a '✓'
- If not, we get a '-' (if it's in another position) or if it's not in position 1 but present, we get '-'.

But we already know R is in the word, so we are testing the position.

Also, we get information about U, S, T, Y.

So, I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, I'll go with ""RUSTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.

For the next guess:
- Avoid C, A, N, E.
- Include R in a new position (not position 2) to test its location.
- Use new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, U, Y).

A strong second guess is ""rusty"" because:
- It places R in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It introduces new common letters (U, S, T, Y) not yet tried.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information potential.

<guess>rusty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(x) S(-) T(-) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 but wrong position).
- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

From Guess 2: ""rusty"" -> R(-) U(x) S(-) T(-) Y(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1 (since guessed at position 1 and got '-' meaning present but wrong position).
- U and Y are not in the word at all.
- S and T are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively (since S was at position 3 and T at position 4 in ""rusty"").

Combining the feedback:
- The secret word contains R, S, and T (since both S and T are marked as present).
- It does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, Y.

Also, from Guess 1, R was not in position 2, and from Guess 2, R is not in position 1. So R is in the word, but not in position 1 or 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, S was guessed at position 3 (in ""rusty"") and was marked wrong position, so S is not in position 3. T was guessed at position 4 and marked wrong position, so T is not in position 4.

We have not tested position 5 yet (in terms of R, S, T placement).

We need a word that:
- Contains R, S, T
- Does not contain C, A, N, E, U, Y
- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5
- S is not in position 3 (but can be in others)
- T is not in position 4 (but can be in others)

Also, since S and T are in the word, we need to place them in positions not yet ruled out.

Possible positions:
For R: positions 3,4,5
For S: positions 1,2,4,5 (since not position 3)
For T: positions 1,2,3,5 (since not position 4)

We also need to fill the other two letters with letters not yet tried and not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, A, E, N, U, Y (from the feedback)

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others, but common letters)

We should aim for a word that fits the constraints and uses common letters to test more possibilities.

Since R must be in position 3,4, or 5, and we want to test its position, we can try to place R in position 3 and S and T accordingly.

Moreover, we know there are three confirmed letters: R, S, T.

The word has 5 letters, so two more letters are unknown.

Let us try to think of words that contain R, S, T and don't use the excluded letters.

Some possibilities:
- Words with R in position 3: e.g., _ _ R _ _
  - Possible words: ""BIRDS"" but D is allowed? Yes, but ""BIRDS"" has D and S (S at position 5). Also, we need T? ""BIRDS"" does not have T. So not.
  - We need a word that has R, S, T. For example: ""TRIES"" but note E is excluded, so not allowed.
  - ""FIRST"" - let's check:
    - F, I, R, S, T. Does it use excluded letters? E? No. U? No. Excluded are C,A,E,N,U,Y so F,I,R,S,T are all allowed.
    - Positions in ""FIRST"": F(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5)
    - But we know S cannot be in position 3? In ""FIRST"", S is in position 4, which is okay because we only know S is not in position 3. Similarly, T is in position 5: not position 4, so okay.
    - Also, R is in position 3: which is one of the possible positions. But note: in ""rusty"", we had T in position 4 and it was '-', meaning T is in the word but not position 4. In ""FIRST"", T is in position 5, which is fine.

However, we need to check against the feedback: in ""rusty"", S was tried in position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. But in ""FIRST"", we are putting S in position 4. Also, T in position 5.

But the secret word could be ""FIRST""? We need to verify the R position: R must be in 3,4,5. Here it is in 3.

Now, let's see if there is conflicting feedback: in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and wrong. In ""rusty"", R was in position 1 and wrong. In ""FIRST"", R in position 3: we don't know yet.

Another candidate: what about R in position 4? E.g., ""WORST"" but W,O,R,S,T - no excluded letters? Yes. And positions: W(1), O(2), R(3? wait no: ""WORST"" is W-O-R-S-T, so R at position 3? Same as ""FIRST"". Actually, ""WORST"" has R at position 3 as well.

How about a word with R at position 4? E.g., ""_ _ _ R _""
- Like ""BOARS"" but A is excluded? A cannot be used. So not.
- ""FORTs"" - not 5 letters? ""FORTS"" is 5 letters: F,O,R,T,S. R is in position 3? Again position 3.

Actually, it's hard to find words with R in position 4 or 5 that also contain S and T.

What about ""STRAW""? S,T,R,A,W - but A is excluded.

""START"" - S,T,A,R,T - but A excluded and duplicate T? But A is out.

What about ""STRIP"" - S,T,R,I,P. Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). R in position 3.

Similarly, ""STRAP"" - but A is out.

Another idea: R at position 5? E.g., ""_ _ _ _ R"", and also containing S and T. E.g., ""DEMUR"" but D,E,M,U,R - E and U are excluded. Not.

""MINOR"" - M,I,N,O,R: but N is excluded. No.

So it seems that words with R in position 3 are common for R,S,T words.

Another candidate: ""THREE"" but E is excluded, and duplicate E? Not allowed.

""SHORT"" - S,H,O,R,T. No excluded letters: S(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). Ah, here R is in position 4.

Yes: ""SHORT"" has R in position 4.

Now, check positions:
- S is in position 1: is that okay? We only know S is not in position 3 (from rusty). Position 1 is not ruled out.
- H: not tried before, so possible.
- O: not tried, okay.
- R: in position 4, which is allowed (since not position 1 or 2).
- T: in position 5. We know T is in the word and not in position 4 (from rusty), so position 5 is okay.

Also, no excluded letters: S,H,O,R,T — H,O not excluded.

Now, is H,O allowed? Excluded are C,A,E,N,U,Y, so H and O are fine.

Another candidate: ""SPORTS"" is 6 letters, too long.

""PORTS"" - P,O,R,T,S. Positions: P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). But in this word, T is in position 4. However, from feedback: in ""rusty"", T was guessed at position 4 and got a '-' meaning T is present but not in position 4. Therefore, T cannot be in position 4 in the secret word. So if we guess ""PORTS"", T would be at position 4, which is invalid (because secret word cannot have T there). So we cannot use ""PORTS"".

But in ""SHORT"", T is at position 5, not 4.

Another candidate: ""TROUS"" — not a word.

""TRIPS"" - T,R,I,P,S. R in position 3: T(1), R(2)? Wait: T-R-I-P-S: so R at position 2? But we know R cannot be in position 2 (from crane). Because in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and gave a '-', which means R is in the word but not position 2. Therefore, we cannot have R in position 2 in any guess? Actually, we know from feedback that position 2 is wrong for R, so the secret word does not have R in position 2. Therefore, any guess should not put R in position 2 if we know it's incorrect? Actually, in a guess we can put it anywhere to test, but we know it's not position 2, so it won't be correct there. But for efficiency, we should avoid position 2 for R.

In ""TRIPS"", R is in position 2, which we know is incorrect, so it might not be optimal. Instead, we should try a word that tests R in a new position (like 4 or 5) to gather information.

We have tried position 1 and 2 for R and both wrong, so R must be in 3,4,5.

In ""SHORT"", R is in position 4. This tests position 4.

Similarly, S and T are also placed: S in position 1, T in position 5.

We have not tested position 3 for S? We know S is not in position 3 (from rusty feedback), so we can place S elsewhere.

In ""SHORT"", S is in position 1, which hasn't been tested for S before.

Similarly, T is in position 5, not 4.

Also, we introduce H and O, which are new.

Now, let's compare ""SHORT"" and ""FIRST"". ""FIRST"" has R in position 3. Both seem possible.

We could also consider a word with R at position 5? For example, ""STORE"" but E is excluded. Not.

""STORK"" - S,T,O,R,K: positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),R(4),K(5)

So R in position 4 again? Actually, R is in position 4? S-T-O-R-K: R at position 4.

In terms of letter testing, ""STORK"" has K, which is a consonant.

But ""SHORT"" uses H and O.

I think ""SHORT"" is a good choice because:
- It tests R in position 4 (we haven't tried this position yet)
- S in position 1 and T in position 5 (new positions for them)
- H and O are new letters

Alternatively, we could try a word that places S and T in different positions to cover more.

But note: we only have 4 guesses left (if needed).

So I'll go with ""SHORT"".

But let's make sure about the feedback: if we guess ""SHORT"", what feedback would we expect if the secret word is, say, ""brisk""? But we don't know.

But we are trying to get as much information as possible.

Another constraint: the secret word does not have U, Y, etc.

So, I think ""SHORT"" is a valid guess.

Therefore, third guess: ""SHORT""

<guess>short</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From ""crane"": R is present (not position 2), and C, A, N, E are absent.
- From ""rusty"": R is present (not position 1), U and Y are absent, and S and T are present (not positions 3 and 4, respectively).

### Key Deductions:
1. **Confirmed Letters in Secret Word**: R, S, T.
2. **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, U, Y.
3. **Position Constraints**:
   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (so it must be in 3, 4, or 5).

It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n- The letter R is in the secret word, but not in the first position (since it was in the second position of ""crane"" and got a \'-\', meaning it\'s present but not there).\n- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains the letter R, and does not contain C, A, N, E.\n\nWe have 5 more guesses (since we used one).\n\nFor the next guess, we should:\n- Avoid using the letters C, A, N, E.\n- Include the letter R (since we know it\'s in the word) and place it in a different position than the second (because in ""crane"" it was in position 2 and that was wrong).\n- Use other common letters that haven\'t been tried yet to maximize information.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe know R is in the word, so we should try to put R in a position that we haven\'t tried. Since it was in position 2 and that was wrong, we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nWe also want to cover other common vowels and consonants. The vowels we haven\'t tried are: I, O, U (since A and E are out). We should include one of these.\n\nA good strategy is to pick a word that has R and also includes other common letters.\n\nLet\'s consider some words that fit:\n- Must have R, and avoid C, A, N, E.\n- We can try words like ""ROTIS"", but that\'s not a word. We need valid English words.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""ROBOT"" - but has O and T, but also has B and O. However, it has two O\'s and we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically in Wordle, words can have duplicate letters? But in this case, the secret word might not have duplicates. However, we don\'t know. But in our feedback, we only have one R so far, so we don\'t know.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""crane"" showed only R was present. So if the word had two R\'s, we would have seen two \'-\' or one correct? Actually, no: if there is only one R in the secret word and we have one R in the guess, we get one \'-\'. If there were two R\'s, and one is in the correct position, then we would get a \'✓\' for that one. But if both are misplaced, we would get two \'-\'. In this case, we only have one R in the guess and we got one \'-\', so the secret word has at least one R.\n\nBut we don\'t know if it has more. So we should avoid using duplicate letters for now to not waste a guess.\n\nSo, let\'s pick a word with R and four new letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""ROILS"" - meaning to agitate liquid. But we don\'t know if S is in the word? We can try.\n- ""ROBIN"" - but N is out (from feedback: N is not in the word). So we cannot use N.\n- ""ROWDY"" - has R, O, W, D, Y. All new letters.\n\nBut we must avoid A, C, E, N. So ""ROWDY"" is okay.\n\nAnother option: ""SPRIG"" - but S, P, R, I, G. However, R is in the third position? But we have R in the word, and we want to try a different position. In ""crane"", R was in position 2. So in ""SPRIG"", R is in position 3. That might be good.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that we are limited to 5-letter words.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nList of common letters to try: S, T, L, I, O, D, H, etc.\n\nI think ""ROWDY"" is a valid word and uses R, O, W, D, Y. All new.\n\nAnother one: ""TRIED"" - but E is out, so we cannot use E.\n\n""TRIED"" has E, which is not allowed.\n\n""PROUD"" - has P, R, O, U, D. Avoids the forbidden letters.\n\n""PROUD"" is a good candidate.\n\n""SPORT"" - has S, P, O, R, T. R is in the fourth position? In ""crane"", R was in position 2, so trying position 4 is different.\n\nBut we want to test R in a different position. Also, we want to test other common letters.\n\nAnother idea: since we know R is in the word, and we have 5 positions, we can try R in position 1.\n\nFor example: ""RUSTY"" - has R, U, S, T, Y. Avoids forbidden letters.\n\n""RUSTY"" is a good word.\n\nWe can also try ""ROAST"" - but A is out, so we cannot use A.\n\nSo, ""ROAST"" is invalid because of A.\n\n""ROBOT"" - has O twice? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. But we can use it? Actually, the word ""robot"" is valid, but we are avoiding duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nBut let\'s not use duplicates. So ""ROBOT"" has two O\'s, so we might be wasting a letter slot.\n\nBetter to use all distinct letters.\n\nSo, let\'s choose between ""ROWDY"", ""PROUD"", ""RUSTY"", ""SPRIG"".\n\nI think ""RUSTY"" is a good choice because:\n- It has R in position 1 (which we haven\'t tried)\n- It has U (a vowel we haven\'t tried) and S, T, Y (common consonants)\n\nAlternatively, ""SPRIG"" has R in position 3, which is also a new position.\n\nBut ""SPRIG"" has S, P, R, I, G. I is a vowel we haven\'t tried.\n\nBoth are good.\n\nI\'ll go with ""RUSTY"" because it tests R in the first position and uses common letters.\n\nSo, second guess: ""RUSTY""\n\nBut note: we must output in the format.\n\nLet me confirm: we are to output <guess>rusty</guess>\n\nBut wait, we have to think: if R is in the secret word, and we put it in position 1, we might get:\n- If R is actually in position 1, we get a \'✓\'\n- If not, we get a \'-\' (if it\'s in another position) or if it\'s not in position 1 but present, we get \'-\'.\n\nBut we already know R is in the word, so we are testing the position.\n\nAlso, we get information about U, S, T, Y.\n\nSo, I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""RUSTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 2.\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Avoid C, A, N, E.\n- Include R in a new position (not position 2) to test its location.\n- Use new common letters to gather more information (e.g., S, T, U, Y).\n\nA strong second guess is ""rusty"" because:\n- It places R in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- It introduces new common letters (U, S, T, Y) not yet tried.\n- All letters are distinct, maximizing information potential.\n\n<guess>rusty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(x) S(-) T(-) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed at position 2 but wrong position).\n- C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nFrom Guess 2: ""rusty"" -> R(-) U(x) S(-) T(-) Y(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word but not in position 1 (since guessed at position 1 and got \'-\' meaning present but wrong position).\n- U and Y are not in the word at all.\n- S and T are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4 respectively (since S was at position 3 and T at position 4 in ""rusty"").\n\nCombining the feedback:\n- The secret word contains R, S, and T (since both S and T are marked as present).\n- It does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, Y.\n\nAlso, from Guess 1, R was not in position 2, and from Guess 2, R is not in position 1. So R is in the word, but not in position 1 or 2. Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nSimilarly, S was guessed at position 3 (in ""rusty"") and was marked wrong position, so S is not in position 3. T was guessed at position 4 and marked wrong position, so T is not in position 4.\n\nWe have not tested position 5 yet (in terms of R, S, T placement).\n\nWe need a word that:\n- Contains R, S, T\n- Does not contain C, A, N, E, U, Y\n- R must be in position 3, 4, or 5\n- S is not in position 3 (but can be in others)\n- T is not in position 4 (but can be in others)\n\nAlso, since S and T are in the word, we need to place them in positions not yet ruled out.\n\nPossible positions:\nFor R: positions 3,4,5\nFor S: positions 1,2,4,5 (since not position 3)\nFor T: positions 1,2,3,5 (since not position 4)\n\nWe also need to fill the other two letters with letters not yet tried and not excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: C, A, E, N, U, Y (from the feedback)\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others, but common letters)\n\nWe should aim for a word that fits the constraints and uses common letters to test more possibilities.\n\nSince R must be in position 3,4, or 5, and we want to test its position, we can try to place R in position 3 and S and T accordingly.\n\nMoreover, we know there are three confirmed letters: R, S, T.\n\nThe word has 5 letters, so two more letters are unknown.\n\nLet us try to think of words that contain R, S, T and don\'t use the excluded letters.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- Words with R in position 3: e.g., _ _ R _ _\n  - Possible words: ""BIRDS"" but D is allowed? Yes, but ""BIRDS"" has D and S (S at position 5). Also, we need T? ""BIRDS"" does not have T. So not.\n  - We need a word that has R, S, T. For example: ""TRIES"" but note E is excluded, so not allowed.\n  - ""FIRST"" - let\'s check:\n    - F, I, R, S, T. Does it use excluded letters? E? No. U? No. Excluded are C,A,E,N,U,Y so F,I,R,S,T are all allowed.\n    - Positions in ""FIRST"": F(1), I(2), R(3), S(4), T(5)\n    - But we know S cannot be in position 3? In ""FIRST"", S is in position 4, which is okay because we only know S is not in position 3. Similarly, T is in position 5: not position 4, so okay.\n    - Also, R is in position 3: which is one of the possible positions. But note: in ""rusty"", we had T in position 4 and it was \'-\', meaning T is in the word but not position 4. In ""FIRST"", T is in position 5, which is fine.\n\nHowever, we need to check against the feedback: in ""rusty"", S was tried in position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position. But in ""FIRST"", we are putting S in position 4. Also, T in position 5.\n\nBut the secret word could be ""FIRST""? We need to verify the R position: R must be in 3,4,5. Here it is in 3.\n\nNow, let\'s see if there is conflicting feedback: in ""crane"", R was in position 2 and wrong. In ""rusty"", R was in position 1 and wrong. In ""FIRST"", R in position 3: we don\'t know yet.\n\nAnother candidate: what about R in position 4? E.g., ""WORST"" but W,O,R,S,T - no excluded letters? Yes. And positions: W(1), O(2), R(3? wait no: ""WORST"" is W-O-R-S-T, so R at position 3? Same as ""FIRST"". Actually, ""WORST"" has R at position 3 as well.\n\nHow about a word with R at position 4? E.g., ""_ _ _ R _""\n- Like ""BOARS"" but A is excluded? A cannot be used. So not.\n- ""FORTs"" - not 5 letters? ""FORTS"" is 5 letters: F,O,R,T,S. R is in position 3? Again position 3.\n\nActually, it\'s hard to find words with R in position 4 or 5 that also contain S and T.\n\nWhat about ""STRAW""? S,T,R,A,W - but A is excluded.\n\n""START"" - S,T,A,R,T - but A excluded and duplicate T? But A is out.\n\nWhat about ""STRIP"" - S,T,R,I,P. Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5). R in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""STRAP"" - but A is out.\n\nAnother idea: R at position 5? E.g., ""_ _ _ _ R"", and also containing S and T. E.g., ""DEMUR"" but D,E,M,U,R - E and U are excluded. Not.\n\n""MINOR"" - M,I,N,O,R: but N is excluded. No.\n\nSo it seems that words with R in position 3 are common for R,S,T words.\n\nAnother candidate: ""THREE"" but E is excluded, and duplicate E? Not allowed.\n\n""SHORT"" - S,H,O,R,T. No excluded letters: S(1), H(2), O(3), R(4), T(5). Ah, here R is in position 4.\n\nYes: ""SHORT"" has R in position 4.\n\nNow, check positions:\n- S is in position 1: is that okay? We only know S is not in position 3 (from rusty). Position 1 is not ruled out.\n- H: not tried before, so possible.\n- O: not tried, okay.\n- R: in position 4, which is allowed (since not position 1 or 2).\n- T: in position 5. We know T is in the word and not in position 4 (from rusty), so position 5 is okay.\n\nAlso, no excluded letters: S,H,O,R,T — H,O not excluded.\n\nNow, is H,O allowed? Excluded are C,A,E,N,U,Y, so H and O are fine.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SPORTS"" is 6 letters, too long.\n\n""PORTS"" - P,O,R,T,S. Positions: P(1), O(2), R(3), T(4), S(5). But in this word, T is in position 4. However, from feedback: in ""rusty"", T was guessed at position 4 and got a \'-\' meaning T is present but not in position 4. Therefore, T cannot be in position 4 in the secret word. So if we guess ""PORTS"", T would be at position 4, which is invalid (because secret word cannot have T there). So we cannot use ""PORTS"".\n\nBut in ""SHORT"", T is at position 5, not 4.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TROUS"" — not a word.\n\n""TRIPS"" - T,R,I,P,S. R in position 3: T(1), R(2)? Wait: T-R-I-P-S: so R at position 2? But we know R cannot be in position 2 (from crane). Because in ""crane"", R was at position 2 and gave a \'-\', which means R is in the word but not position 2. Therefore, we cannot have R in position 2 in any guess? Actually, we know from feedback that position 2 is wrong for R, so the secret word does not have R in position 2. Therefore, any guess should not put R in position 2 if we know it\'s incorrect? Actually, in a guess we can put it anywhere to test, but we know it\'s not position 2, so it won\'t be correct there. But for efficiency, we should avoid position 2 for R.\n\nIn ""TRIPS"", R is in position 2, which we know is incorrect, so it might not be optimal. Instead, we should try a word that tests R in a new position (like 4 or 5) to gather information.\n\nWe have tried position 1 and 2 for R and both wrong, so R must be in 3,4,5.\n\nIn ""SHORT"", R is in position 4. This tests position 4.\n\nSimilarly, S and T are also placed: S in position 1, T in position 5.\n\nWe have not tested position 3 for S? We know S is not in position 3 (from rusty feedback), so we can place S elsewhere.\n\nIn ""SHORT"", S is in position 1, which hasn\'t been tested for S before.\n\nSimilarly, T is in position 5, not 4.\n\nAlso, we introduce H and O, which are new.\n\nNow, let\'s compare ""SHORT"" and ""FIRST"". ""FIRST"" has R in position 3. Both seem possible.\n\nWe could also consider a word with R at position 5? For example, ""STORE"" but E is excluded. Not.\n\n""STORK"" - S,T,O,R,K: positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),R(4),K(5)\n\nSo R in position 4 again? Actually, R is in position 4? S-T-O-R-K: R at position 4.\n\nIn terms of letter testing, ""STORK"" has K, which is a consonant.\n\nBut ""SHORT"" uses H and O.\n\nI think ""SHORT"" is a good choice because:\n- It tests R in position 4 (we haven\'t tried this position yet)\n- S in position 1 and T in position 5 (new positions for them)\n- H and O are new letters\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that places S and T in different positions to cover more.\n\nBut note: we only have 4 guesses left (if needed).\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SHORT"".\n\nBut let\'s make sure about the feedback: if we guess ""SHORT"", what feedback would we expect if the secret word is, say, ""brisk""? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we are trying to get as much information as possible.\n\nAnother constraint: the secret word does not have U, Y, etc.\n\nSo, I think ""SHORT"" is a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, third guess: ""SHORT""\n\n<guess>short</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- From ""crane"": R is present (not position 2), and C, A, N, E are absent.\n- From ""rusty"": R is present (not position 1), U and Y are absent, and S and T are present (not positions 3 and 4, respectively).\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **Confirmed Letters in Secret Word**: R, S, T.\n2. **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, U, Y.\n3. **Position Constraints**:\n   - R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (so it must be in 3, 4, or 5).\n   - S cannot be in position 3.\n   - T cannot be in position 4.\n4. **Available Letters**: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z are untried/not excluded. Focus on common letters (e.g., H, O, I).\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- **Test R in position 4** (untried position) to gather information on its exact placement.\n- Avoid excluded letters and position constraints for S and T.\n- Include new common letters like H and O for broader coverage.\n- **Selected Guess: ""SHORT""**:\n  - S in position 1 (never tested; S cannot be in 3 but other positions are possible).\n  - H and O are new letters to test.\n  - R in position 4 (new position to confirm/rule out).\n  - T in position 5 (never tested; avoids position 4).\n- This guess efficiently tests new positions and letters while adhering to constraints.\n\n<guess>short</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(x) S(-) T(-) Y(x)\nGuess 3: short -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from Guess 3: ""short"" -> S(✓) H(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓)
This means:
- S is correct and in position 1 (because S is first and marked ✓).
- H is not in the word (x).
- O is correct and in position 3? Wait, let's check the positions:
  ""short"" is S-H-O-R-T
  Position 1: S -> ✓
  Position 2: H -> x (not in word)
  Position 3: O -> ✓ (correct and in position)
  Position 4: R -> ✓ (correct and in position)
  Position 5: T -> ✓ (correct and in position)

Wait, so the feedback says:
S(✓) H(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓)

This indicates that S, O, R, and T are all in their correct positions. But note that the feedback for O is ✓ and it's at position 3, meaning in the secret word, O is at position 3. Similarly, R at position 4 and T at position 5.

Moreover, S is at position 1 and correct.

H is not in the word.

So, combining, the secret word has:
- Position 1: S (from feedback S✓)
- Position 3: O (from O✓)
- Position 4: R (from R✓)
- Position 5: T (from T✓)

And position 2 is not H (and H is absent), but we don't know about position 2 yet.

So, the word so far is: S _ O R T

We need to fill in the second position. The missing letter is at position 2.

Now, what about previous feedback?

From Guess 1: ""crane"" -> R is in the word but not position 2. But we now know R is in position 4, consistent.

From Guess 2: ""rusty"" -> R not position 1 (consistent, now we know R is at 4), S not position 3 (but now we know S is at position 1, so it's not 3, consistent), T not position 4 (but T is at position 5, so not 4, consistent), and U and Y are absent.

The only letter missing is the one at position 2.

What letters are possible?

We know the secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, Y, H (from feedback).

Also, from the word structure: S _ O R T

The word must be a valid English word: something like ""SORT"" is 4 letters, but we have S?ORT, so a 5-letter word.

Common words: SHORT? But H is excluded, and we got H marked absent, so it cannot be SHORT.

What words fit the pattern S?ORT, where ? is a letter not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, A, E, N, U, Y, H (from known feedback).

The letter at position 2 should be one that forms a valid word.

Possible letters: Let's list available letters. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We can try common ones: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, W.

Possible words matching S?ORT:

- SCORT? Not a word.
- SORT? Already 4 letters.
- We need S followed by one letter, then ORT.

So, the word is of the form S X O R T, where X is a letter.

What about ""SPORT""? Yes, ""sport"" is a word.

But check: P is not excluded? Excluded are C,A,N,E,U,Y,H. P is okay.

""SNORT""? But N is excluded (from guess 1: N x).

""STORT""? Not a word.

""SKORT""? Not a standard word.

""SPORT"" seems the most common.

Other possibilities? ""SWORT"" not a word.

""STORT"" no.

So, is ""SPORT"" a possibility? With X=P.

Wait, but we have to confirm: in our guess 3, we guessed ""SHORT"", which was S? H O R T, and H was absent. So if the secret word were ""SPORT"", then:

- Position 1: S (correct)
- Position 2: H vs P? H is not in the word, so it would be marked x, which matches (H was x).
- Position 3: O (correct) -> ✓
- Position 4: R (correct) -> ✓
- Position 5: T (correct) -> ✓

Also, for ""SPORT"", the letter P hasn't been tested before.

But note: we must consider if there are other possibilities.

What about ""SCOUR""? No, but that would not match since O should be at position 3? Wait, no: the pattern is fixed: positions 1:S, 3:O, 4:R, 5:T. So position 2 must be filled.

Are there other words besides ""SPORT""?

For example:
- ""SNORT"" but N excluded -> invalid.
- ""STORE"" but E excluded -> invalid.
- ""STORK"" -> but K is possible? But then the word would be S _ O R T. So if position 2 is T? No, because T is at position 5. Wait, ""stork"" is S-T-O-R-K, which doesn't have T at position 5? No.

The word must end with ""ORT"", so ...ORT, meaning positions 3,4,5 are O,R,T.

So, S in position 1 and something in position 2.

So, words: ""SHORT"", but H is absent.

""SPORT"", with P.

Are there others?
- ""ABORT"" but A excluded and S not at start? No.

Specifically, S?ORT words:
- ""SPORT"" - yes.
- ""SKORT"" - sometimes used, but less common. But typically not in standard word lists? Probably not.
- ""SWORT"" - no.

I think ""SPORT"" is the most likely candidate.

But we haven't tested P yet? So we can guess ""SPORT"" to confirm.

But note the feedback: if we guess ""SPORT"", then:

Position 1: S - should be ✓ (since we know S is at 1).
Position 2: P - we don't know yet.
Position 3: O - known to be ✓
Position 4: R - known to be ✓
Position 5: T - known to be ✓

So the key is position 2: if P is in the word? But in ""SPORT"", if P is in the word, but we know from position constraints? Actually, we don't know if P is in the word or not.

Since the word must be S?ORT, and we know ? cannot be H (excluded), and only P seems common, so ""SPORT"" is likely.

To be safe, we can guess ""SPORT"" directly.

We have only 3 guesses left? Wait, guess 3 was used, so we have 3 more.

But since the word might be ""SPORT"", we can guess that.

Are there any other possibilities?

What about ""STORM""? No, because positions 4 and 5 must be R T? But here it would be S T O R M? Doesn't fit.

No, the pattern is fixed: positions 1:S, 3:O, 4:R, 5:T. So position 2 must be a letter that forms a word.

Given the constraints, ""SPORT"" is a valid word and meets all criteria.

Moreover, in our feedback from guess 2: when we said ""rusty"" and got T(-), meaning T is in the word but not position 4. Now, in ""SPORT"", T is at position 5, which is fine.

Similarly, no conflict.

Therefore, the secret word is very likely ""SPORT"".

So, we can guess ""SPORT"".

But let's formalize.

We need to output the next guess.

So, guess 4: ""SPORT""

But if it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback.

Since it matches, we can try.

To confirm: has P been used? No, it's the first time.

And from feedback, P isn't excluded yet.

So, I think it's a good guess.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, the secret word can be deduced as follows:

### Analysis of Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - C, A, N, E are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: rusty → R(-) U(x) S(-) T(-) Y(x)**  
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - S and T are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4, respectively.  
   - U and Y are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: short → S(✓) H(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓)**  
   - S is in position 1 (correct).  
   - O is in position 3 (correct).  
   - R is in position 4 (correct).  
   - T is in position 5 (correct).  
   - H is absent.  
   - This reveals the partial word: `S _ O R T` (with position 2 missing).

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed Letters**: S (position 1), O (position 3), R (position 4), T (position 5).  
- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, U, Y, H.  
- **Missing Letter**: Position 2 must be a letter not excluded, forming a valid English word.  
- **Possible Letters**: From the absence list, the missing letter must be from: B, D, F, G, I, L, M, P, W (common options).  
- **Valid Word Consideration**: The only common English word matching `S _ O R T` is **SPORT**, as other options (e.g., SHORT) are invalid due to excluded letters.  

Given the constraints and common word knowledge, **SPORT** is the logical next guess to solve the puzzle.

<guess>sport</guess>",sport,"We have feedback from Guess 3: ""short"" -> S(✓) H(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓)
This means:
- S is correct and in position 1 (because S is first and marked ✓).
- H is not in the word (x).
- O is correct and in position 3? Wait, let's check the positions:
  ""short"" is S-H-O-R-T
  Position 1: S -> ✓
  Position 2: H -> x (not in word)
  Position 3: O -> ✓ (correct and in position)
  Position 4: R -> ✓ (correct and in position)
  Position 5: T -> ✓ (correct and in position)

Wait, so the feedback says:
S(✓) H(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓)

This indicates that S, O, R, and T are all in their correct positions. But note that the feedback for O is ✓ and it's at position 3, meaning in the secret word, O is at position 3. Similarly, R at position 4 and T at position 5.

Moreover, S is at position 1 and correct.

H is not in the word.

So, combining, the secret word has:
- Position 1: S (from feedback S✓)
- Position 3: O (from O✓)
- Position 4: R (from R✓)
- Position 5: T (from T✓)

And position 2 is not H (and H is absent), but we don't know about position 2 yet.

So, the word so far is: S _ O R T

We need to fill in the second position. The missing letter is at position 2.

Now, what about previous feedback?

From Guess 1: ""crane"" -> R is in the word but not position 2. But we now know R is in position 4, consistent.

From Guess 2: ""rusty"" -> R not position 1 (consistent, now we know R is at 4), S not position 3 (but now we know S is at position 1, so it's not 3, consistent), T not position 4 (but T is at position 5, so not 4, consistent), and U and Y are absent.

The only letter missing is the one at position 2.

What letters are possible?

We know the secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E, U, Y, H (from feedback).

Also, from the word structure: S _ O R T

The word must be a valid English word: something like ""SORT"" is 4 letters, but we have S?ORT, so a 5-letter word.

Common words: SHORT? But H is excluded, and we got H marked absent, so it cannot be SHORT.

What words fit the pattern S?ORT, where ? is a letter not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, A, E, N, U, Y, H (from known feedback).

The letter at position 2 should be one that forms a valid word.

Possible letters: Let's list available letters. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We can try common ones: B, D, F, G, I, K, L, M, P, W.

Possible words matching S?ORT:

- SCORT? Not a word.
- SORT? Already 4 letters.
- We need S followed by one letter, then ORT.

So, the word is of the form S X O R T, where X is a letter.

What about ""SPORT""? Yes, ""sport"" is a word.

But check: P is not excluded? Excluded are C,A,N,E,U,Y,H. P is okay.

""SNORT""? But N is excluded (from guess 1: N x).

""STORT""? Not a word.

""SKORT""? Not a standard word.

""SPORT"" seems the most common.

Other possibilities? ""SWORT"" not a word.

""STORT"" no.

So, is ""SPORT"" a possibility? With X=P.

Wait, but we have to confirm: in our guess 3, we guessed ""SHORT"", which was S? H O R T, and H was absent. So if the secret word were ""SPORT"", then:

- Position 1: S (correct)
- Position 2: H vs P? H is not in the word, so it would be marked x, which matches (H was x).
- Position 3: O (correct) -> ✓
- Position 4: R (correct) -> ✓
- Position 5: T (correct) -> ✓

Also, for ""SPORT"", the letter P hasn't been tested before.

But note: we must consider if there are other possibilities.

What about ""SCOUR""? No, but that would not match since O should be at position 3? Wait, no: the pattern is fixed: positions 1:S, 3:O, 4:R, 5:T. So position 2 must be filled.

Are there other words besides ""SPORT""?

For example:
- ""SNORT"" but N excluded -> invalid.
- ""STORE"" but E excluded -> invalid.
- ""STORK"" -> but K is possible? But then the word would be S _ O R T. So if position 2 is T? No, because T is at position 5. Wait, ""stork"" is S-T-O-R-K, which doesn't have T at position 5? No.

The word must end with ""ORT"", so ...ORT, meaning positions 3,4,5 are O,R,T.

So, S in position 1 and something in position 2.

So, words: ""SHORT"", but H is absent.

""SPORT"", with P.

Are there others?
- ""ABORT"" but A excluded and S not at start? No.

Specifically, S?ORT words:
- ""SPORT"" - yes.
- ""SKORT"" - sometimes used, but less common. But typically not in standard word lists? Probably not.
- ""SWORT"" - no.

I think ""SPORT"" is the most likely candidate.

But we haven't tested P yet? So we can guess ""SPORT"" to confirm.

But note the feedback: if we guess ""SPORT"", then:

Position 1: S - should be ✓ (since we know S is at 1).
Position 2: P - we don't know yet.
Position 3: O - known to be ✓
Position 4: R - known to be ✓
Position 5: T - known to be ✓

So the key is position 2: if P is in the word? But in ""SPORT"", if P is in the word, but we know from position constraints? Actually, we don't know if P is in the word or not.

Since the word must be S?ORT, and we know ? cannot be H (excluded), and only P seems common, so ""SPORT"" is likely.

To be safe, we can guess ""SPORT"" directly.

We have only 3 guesses left? Wait, guess 3 was used, so we have 3 more.

But since the word might be ""SPORT"", we can guess that.

Are there any other possibilities?

What about ""STORM""? No, because positions 4 and 5 must be R T? But here it would be S T O R M? Doesn't fit.

No, the pattern is fixed: positions 1:S, 3:O, 4:R, 5:T. So position 2 must be a letter that forms a word.

Given the constraints, ""SPORT"" is a valid word and meets all criteria.

Moreover, in our feedback from guess 2: when we said ""rusty"" and got T(-), meaning T is in the word but not position 4. Now, in ""SPORT"", T is at position 5, which is fine.

Similarly, no conflict.

Therefore, the secret word is very likely ""SPORT"".

So, we can guess ""SPORT"".

But let's formalize.

We need to output the next guess.

So, guess 4: ""SPORT""

But if it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback.

Since it matches, we can try.

To confirm: has P been used? No, it's the first time.

And from feedback, P isn't excluded yet.

So, I think it's a good guess.Based on the feedback from previous guesses, the secret word can be deduced as follows:

### Analysis of Feedback:
1. **Guess 1: crane → C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
   - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - C, A, N, E are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: rusty → R(-) U(x) S(-) T(-) Y(x)**  
   - R is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - S and T are in the word but not in positions 3 and 4, respectively.  
   - U and Y are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: short → S(✓) H(x) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓)**  
   - S is in position 1 (correct).  
   - O is in position 3 (correct).  
   - R is in position 4 (correct).  
   - T is in position 5 (correct).  
   - H is absent.  
   - This reveals the partial word: `S _ O R T` (with position 2 missing).

### Deductions:
- **Confirmed Letters**: S (position 1), O (position 3), R (position 4), T (position 5).  
- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, U, Y, H.  
- **Missing Letter**: Position 2 must be a letter not excluded, forming a valid English word.  
- **Possible Letters**: From the absence list, the missing letter must be from: B, D, F, G, I, L, M, P, W (common options).  
- **Valid Word Consideration**: The only common English word matching `S _ O R T` is **SPORT**, as other options (e.g., SHORT) are invalid due to excluded letters.  

Given the constraints and common word knowledge, **SPORT** is the logical next guess to solve the puzzle.",Guess 4: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) O(✓) R(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
