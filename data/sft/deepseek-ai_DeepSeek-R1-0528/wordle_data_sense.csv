We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and covers some of the most common letters in English (C, R, A, N, E).

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (in the word and correct position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and it is in the position 5 (since we used the 5th letter as E and it's correct). So the 5th letter of the secret word is E.
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position. It must be in one of the first four positions? But note: our word was ""crane"", which is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. So N is in the word but not at position 4. Since position 5 is taken by E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all. So we must avoid using C, R, A in the next guess.

Also, note that the word does not contain C, R, or A.

We know the 5th letter is E. So the word ends with E.

Our next guess should:
- Contain the letter N (since it's present, and we know it must be in positions 1, 2, or 3). But note: in our next guess, we should try to place N in different positions to test where it might be.
- Exclude the letters C, R, A.
- Include other common letters to get more information.

Moreover, we must keep in mind that E is fixed in position 5. So we can use E in position 5 again, but that's the same. We don't need to change that.

What are some words that end with E and contain N? And without C, R, A.

Also, we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present: C, R, A.

Let's think of words that fit:
- They have 5 letters, ending with E.
- Contain N (but not in the same position as before? We don't know the position of N yet, but we know it's not at position 4? Actually, the feedback was for N: it exists but not in position 4. But it could be in position 1,2,3? But note, the word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. Since position 5 is E, N must be in 1,2,3 or ... wait, position 4 is the only one we know it's not? Actually, we don't know: it could be in position 4? Wait, no: our previous word had N in position 4, and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, N cannot be in position 4 of the secret word? Or could it? Wait: the feedback says it is in the word but not in the correct position? Yes. So N is in the word, but not at position 4. That implies that N must be at positions 1,2,3, or ... 5? But position 5 is E, so it's fixed and cannot be N? Wait: we have E at position 5 as correct. So the secret word ends with E. Therefore, N cannot be at position 5. Then N must be in positions 1,2, or 3.

So, to recap:
- Secret word: _ _ _ _ E
- Contains the letter N in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.
- Does not contain C, R, A.

We have three positions to test for N.

But we also want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

We should try a word that has N in a different position (say position 1 or 2) and also introduces new common letters.

Possible words ending with E? And containing N, but without C, R, A.

Let me list some:
- STONE: S,T,O,N,E -> note: N is at position 4? But we must avoid position 4 for N because we know N is not at position 4? Actually, we don't know the secret word's N position. But if we use ""stone"", we have N at position 4 again? We want to avoid putting N in the same position? No, we can put N in a different position? But currently we know it's not at position 4? Actually, we can try putting N at position 1 or 2 to check? But in ""stone"", N is at position 4. So that might not help? Actually, we can use it: because if we put N in position 4 and if it gets marked as ""x"", that would be inconsistent? But since we already know N is not at position 4? We know that from the previous feedback? Actually, the previous feedback only says that in the word ""crane"", N was present but not in position 4. It doesn't say that the secret word cannot have N at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:

The feedback ""-"" for N in ""crane"" (which was at position 4) means that the secret word does contain the letter N, but not at position 4. Therefore, for the secret word, N must be at a different position (1,2,3, or maybe position 5? But position 5 is E). So we must look for positions 1,2,3.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put N in one of positions 1,2,3 to test? Or we can put it in a position we haven't tested? We haven't tested positions 1,2,3? Actually, we only tried position 4. So we can test in position 1 or 2 or 3? But we don't have to test all at once? We can choose one.

We should try to choose a word that has N in position 1? And then also introduce other letters.

Also, we know E is at the end. So the word ends with E.

Idea: we can use ""ONSET"" but ONSET has O,N,S,E,T. But O and T are new? And N is at position 2? And ends with E? But ""onset"" is five letters: O-N-S-E-T? But that doesn't end with E? It ends with T? So not ending with E? Wait, ONSET is O-N-S-E-T -> positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. We need the word to end with E? So position 5 must be E? So we require the word to end with E.

Wait, the word must be: ???E.

So we need words that end with E? And containing N? Without C,R,A.

Options:
- Consider ""LINE"": too short? It must be 5 letters. So: ""LINED""? Wait, but we need exactly 5 letters? No, we are guessing 5 letters? So we need a word that is exactly 5 letters and ends with E.

Examples: phone, stone, alone, shine, etc.

But ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. This has N at position 4? And ends with E? But N at position 4: we already know N is not at position 4? So if we guess ""stone"", then if the feedback for N is ""-"" again? Then we know N is not at 4 again? Wait, we already know N is not at 4? And let's see: we are going to put N at 4? Then the feedback for N might be:

If N is in the word and we put it at position 4, but the secret word doesn't have N at 4 (we already know that), then it should be ""-"" again? So it doesn't tell us anything new? So maybe we should avoid putting N at position 4? Therefore, we should put N in a position we haven't tried: position 1,2, or 3.

So let's think of words that:
- Have N in position 1 or 2 or 3?
- And end with E.
- Without C,R,A.

Let me try to find a word that ends with E? Also has N in position 1: 
Example: ""noise""? N-O-I-S-E? Wait, ends with E? Yes: N is at position 1? But note that ""noise"" has O and I and S? Also, note we can try ""niche""? N-I-C-H-E? Wait, but we cannot use C? Because C is excluded from the first guess feedback? We have C: x -> it's not in the word. So we cannot use C? So ""niche"" is invalid? Because it has C? Cannot use C,R,A.

So ""noise"" is N,O,I,S,E -> doesn't have C,R,A? And ends with E? And N at position 1? Okay.

Another option: ""niece""? N,I,E,C,E? Again, C is not allowed? So invalid? We cannot use C? So must avoid?

""noise"": N-O-I-S-E? No C,R,A? So okay.

But what about ""tinge""? T-I-N-G-E? Ends with E? And N is at position 3? That could be? So N is at position 3? And has T,I,G? Then we can test?

But note: we also may need to avoid duplicate letters? We don't know if the word has duplicate? So we can still use duplicate if we don't know? But for maximizing information, distinct letters might be better? But let's check the word ""stone""? That has position 4? But if we avoid putting N at 4? Then we might avoid ""stone"".

Let me consider ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? Then we are using N at the 3rd position?

We can think of:

- Option 1: Put N at position 1? -> e.g., ""noise"": N,O,I,S,E.
- Option 2: Put N at position 2? -> e.g., ""inkle""? Wait, is ""inkle"" a word? It is not common? Or ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? But note: ""unite"" ends with E? And N at position 2? And letters: U,N,I,T,E -> no C,R,A? Okay? But U is not that common? Or ""stage""? But stage has A? Avoid A? So invalid? ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E? But N is at position 4? Which we want to avoid? So no? ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E? N at position 4? Avoid? Similarly, ""phone"": P-H-O-N-E? N at 4? Avoid.

What about ""knife"": K-N-I-F-E? Yes? That would have N at position 2? And ends with E? And letters K,N,I,F,E? No C,R,A? Okay? And we can use that? Or ""snide"": S-N-I-D-E? Ends with E? N at position 2? S,N,I,D,E? No C,R,A? Okay.

Or ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W? Ends with W? Not E? So not.

Another idea: ""owine""? Not a word? 

Valid words: ""tinge"" (N at 3), ""noise"" (N at 1), ""knife"" (N at 2), ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Invalid? ""unite"" we considered.

Let me pick ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? 

Then the feedback might tell us about N: if we put N at position 3 and if the secret word has N at position 3, it would be ✓? Otherwise, if N is elsewhere, it would be ""-""? Or if not? But we know N is not at position 4? And we are testing position 3? So if we get a ""-"" for N, then N is not at position 3? But if we get a ✓? Then we know.

Alternatively, I think ""knife"" or ""noise"" are options? Also, common.

But note: we also have E in position 5? And we are repeating E? But that's okay.

I think ""noise"" is good: 
- First letter N: if N is at position 1, then ✓? Else if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know N is in the word? So if we get ""x"" for N? Then it can't be? Because N is present? Actually, if we put N at position 1 and the secret word has N at position 1? Then ✓? If the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get ""-""? Similarly, if at position 3? Then we get ""-""? Because position is wrong? So it doesn't tell us exactly? But we will get information about the position? But note: we are introducing O, I, S? Which are common.

Similarly, with ""tinge"": letters T,I,N,G,E? We are introducing T,I,G.

But note: we don't know if T,I,G are in the word? But that's the purpose? To test new letters.

Also, consider that E is already known? So we can ignore its feedback? Actually, we know E is at position 5? So we don't expect any feedback other than ✓? So we can focus on other positions? Actually, feedback for E should always be ✓? Because it's correct? So no new information? We can save a letter? But we must use E at the end? Actually, we have to? Because we know? So in the next guess, we must put E at the end? Therefore, we will get E: ✓? So we shouldn't waste a letter? But we are trying to test other letters? That's okay? So we are using the E? And then we have to guess?

So I propose ""noise""? Let me go with ""noise""? Or is there a better word?

We want maximum letter coverage? Common letters: S, T, L, N, O? We already know N is present? So we can include S and O? Also, T? How about ""stonk""? Not a word? Or ""stone""? But we avoid stone because it has N at 4? Which we already know is wrong? And the same as the previous guess? Actually, we can use ""stone"" but then we are putting N in position 4? Which we know is not correct? So it would be wasteful? Because if N is not at 4? Then we get ""-""? That's the same feedback? Doesn't help? So we avoid.

Therefore, let me pick ""noise""? 

But ""noise"": 
  N: let's see? Position 1? We don't know? 
  O: position 2?
  I: position 3?
  S: position 4?
  E: position 5: ✓ (we know)

Also, note: we have just used S and O? They are new? They haven't been tested? We don't know about S and O.

So let's do it.

So my next guess: ""noise""

But wait: feedback from first guess: we also know N is present? So we must use N? But if we don't use N? Then we might not get information? Actually, we have to guess words? And we know N is present? So yes, we should include N? So noise includes N? Correct? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""noise"" is good?

Any other options? Like ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? Which has T? As common letter? And U? Less common? Or ""knife""? K-N-I-F-E? F and K? Less common? So ""noise"" is better? Because O,I,S are more common.

So I choose ""noise"".

Therefore, the next guess: ""noise""

But wait: is ""noise"" a valid word? Yes, common.

So response: <guess>noise</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed to be in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.
- N is present in the secret word but not in position 4 (-). Since position 5 is E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- C, R, and A are absent (x) and should be avoided.

For the second guess, we need to:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Include N but not in position 4 (to avoid redundant feedback). I've chosen to place N in position 1 to test a new location.
- Introduce new common vowels and consonants to maximize information, avoiding C, R, A.
- Select a valid English word ending with E.

The word ""noise"" fits these criteria:
- Position 1: N (tests N in position 1).
- Position 2: O (new vowel).
- Position 3: I (new vowel).
- Position 4: S (new consonant).
- Position 5: E (confirmed correct).

This guess may provide useful feedback on N's position (if N is in position 1, it will be ✓; otherwise, -) and reveal whether O, I, or S are present.

<guess>noise</guess>",noise,"We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (in the word and correct position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and it is in the position 5 (since we used the 5th letter as E and it's correct). So the 5th letter of the secret word is E.
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position. It must be in one of the first four positions? But note: our word was ""crane"", which is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. So N is in the word but not at position 4. Since position 5 is taken by E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all. So we must avoid using C, R, A in the next guess.

Also, note that the word does not contain C, R, or A.

We know the 5th letter is E. So the word ends with E.

Our next guess should:
- Contain the letter N (since it's present, and we know it must be in positions 1, 2, or 3). But note: in our next guess, we should try to place N in different positions to test where it might be.
- Exclude the letters C, R, A.
- Include other common letters to get more information.

Moreover, we must keep in mind that E is fixed in position 5. So we can use E in position 5 again, but that's the same. We don't need to change that.

What are some words that end with E and contain N? And without C, R, A.

Also, we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present: C, R, A.

Let's think of words that fit:
- They have 5 letters, ending with E.
- Contain N (but not in the same position as before? We don't know the position of N yet, but we know it's not at position 4? Actually, the feedback was for N: it exists but not in position 4. But it could be in position 1,2,3? But note, the word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. Since position 5 is E, N must be in 1,2,3 or ... wait, position 4 is the only one we know it's not? Actually, we don't know: it could be in position 4? Wait, no: our previous word had N in position 4, and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, N cannot be in position 4 of the secret word? Or could it? Wait: the feedback says it is in the word but not in the correct position? Yes. So N is in the word, but not at position 4. That implies that N must be at positions 1,2,3, or ... 5? But position 5 is E, so it's fixed and cannot be N? Wait: we have E at position 5 as correct. So the secret word ends with E. Therefore, N cannot be at position 5. Then N must be in positions 1,2, or 3.

So, to recap:
- Secret word: _ _ _ _ E
- Contains the letter N in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.
- Does not contain C, R, A.

We have three positions to test for N.

But we also want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

We should try a word that has N in a different position (say position 1 or 2) and also introduces new common letters.

Possible words ending with E? And containing N, but without C, R, A.

Let me list some:

But if we use ""stone"", we have N at position 4 again? We want to avoid putting N in the same position? No, we can put N in a different position? But currently we know it's not at position 4? Actually, we can try putting N at position 1 or 2 to check? But in ""stone"", N is at position 4. So that might not help? Actually, we can use it: because if we put N in position 4 and if it gets marked as ""x"", that would be inconsistent? But since we already know N is not at position 4? We know that from the previous feedback? Actually, the previous feedback only says that in the word ""crane"", N was present but not in position 4. It doesn't say that the secret word cannot have N at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:

The feedback ""-"" for N in ""crane"" (which was at position 4) means that the secret word does contain the letter N, but not at position 4. Therefore, for the secret word, N must be at a different position (1,2,3, or maybe position 5? But position 5 is E). So we must look for positions 1,2,3.

Actually, we only tried position 4. So we can test in position 1 or 2 or 3? But we don't have to test all at once? We can choose one.

Then we know N is not at 4 again? Wait, we already know N is not at 4? And let's see: we are going to put N at 4? Then the feedback for N might be:

If N is in the word and we put it at position 4, but the secret word doesn't have N at 4 (we already know that), then it should be ""-"" again? So it doesn't tell us anything new? So maybe we should avoid putting N at position 4? Therefore, we should put N in a position we haven't tried: position 1,2, or 3.

So let's think of words that:
- Have N in position 1 or 2 or 3?
- And end with E.
- Without C,R,A.

Let me try to find a word that ends with E? Also has N in position 1: 
Example: ""noise""? N-O-I-S-E? Wait, ends with E? Yes: N is at position 1? But note that ""noise"" has O and I and S? Also, note we can try ""niche""? N-I-C-H-E? Wait, but we cannot use C? Because C is excluded from the first guess feedback? We have C: x -> it's not in the word. So we cannot use C? So ""niche"" is invalid? Because it has C? Cannot use C,R,A.

So ""noise"" is N,O,I,S,E -> doesn't have C,R,A? And ends with E? And N at position 1? Okay.

Another option: ""niece""? N,I,E,C,E? Again, C is not allowed? So invalid? We cannot use C? So must avoid?

""noise"": N-O-I-S-E? No C,R,A? So okay.

But what about ""tinge""? T-I-N-G-E? Ends with E? And N is at position 3? That could be? So N is at position 3? And has T,I,G? Then we can test?

But note: we also may need to avoid duplicate letters? We don't know if the word has duplicate? So we can still use duplicate if we don't know? But for maximizing information, distinct letters might be better? But let's check the word ""stone""? That has position 4? But if we avoid putting N at 4? Then we might avoid ""stone"".

Let me consider ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? Then we are using N at the 3rd position?

We can think of:

- Option 1: Put N at position 1? -> e.g., ""noise"": N,O,I,S,E.
- Option 2: Put N at position 2? -> e.g., ""inkle""? Wait, is ""inkle"" a word? It is not common? Or ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? But note: ""unite"" ends with E? And N at position 2? And letters: U,N,I,T,E -> no C,R,A? Okay? But U is not that common? Or ""stage""? But stage has A? Avoid A? So invalid? ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E? But N is at position 4? Which we want to avoid? So no? ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E? N at position 4? Avoid? Similarly, ""phone"": P-H-O-N-E? N at 4? Avoid.

What about ""knife"": K-N-I-F-E? Yes? That would have N at position 2? And ends with E? And letters K,N,I,F,E? No C,R,A? Okay? And we can use that? Or ""snide"": S-N-I-D-E? Ends with E? N at position 2? S,N,I,D,E? No C,R,A? Okay.

Or ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W? Ends with W? Not E? So not.

Another idea: ""owine""? Not a word? 

Valid words: ""tinge"" (N at 3), ""noise"" (N at 1), ""knife"" (N at 2), ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Invalid? ""unite"" we considered.

Let me pick ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? 

Then the feedback might tell us about N: if we put N at position 3 and if the secret word has N at position 3, it would be ✓? Otherwise, if N is elsewhere, it would be ""-""? Or if not? But we know N is not at position 4? And we are testing position 3? So if we get a ""-"" for N, then N is not at position 3? But if we get a ✓? Then we know.

Alternatively, I think ""knife"" or ""noise"" are options? Also, common.

But note: we also have E in position 5? And we are repeating E? But that's okay.

I think ""noise"" is good: 
- First letter N: if N is at position 1, then ✓? Else if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know N is in the word? So if we get ""x"" for N? Then it can't be? Because N is present? Actually, if we put N at position 1 and the secret word has N at position 1? Then ✓? If the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get ""-""? Similarly, if at position 3? Then we get ""-""? Because position is wrong? So it doesn't tell us exactly? But we will get information about the position? But note: we are introducing O, I, S? Which are common.

Similarly, with ""tinge"": letters T,I,N,G,E? We are introducing T,I,G.

But note: we don't know if T,I,G are in the word? But that's the purpose? To test new letters.

Also, consider that E is already known? So we can ignore its feedback? Actually, we know E is at position 5? So we don't expect any feedback other than ✓? So we can focus on other positions? Actually, feedback for E should always be ✓? Because it's correct? So no new information? We can save a letter? But we must use E at the end? Actually, we have to? Because we know? So in the next guess, we must put E at the end? Therefore, we will get E: ✓? So we shouldn't waste a letter? But we are trying to test other letters? That's okay? So we are using the E? And then we have to guess?

So I propose ""noise""? Let me go with ""noise""? Or is there a better word?

We want maximum letter coverage? Common letters: S, T, L, N, O? We already know N is present? So we can include S and O? Also, T? How about ""stonk""? Not a word? Or ""stone""? But we avoid stone because it has N at 4? Which we already know is wrong? And the same as the previous guess? Actually, we can use ""stone"" but then we are putting N in position 4? Which we know is not correct? So it would be wasteful? Because if N is not at 4? Then we get ""-""? That's the same feedback? Doesn't help? So we avoid.

Therefore, let me pick ""noise""? 

But ""noise"": 
  N: let's see? Position 1? We don't know? 
  O: position 2?
  I: position 3?
  S: position 4?
  E: position 5: ✓ (we know)

Also, note: we have just used S and O? They are new? They haven't been tested? We don't know about S and O.

So let's do it.

So my next guess: ""noise""

But wait: feedback from first guess: we also know N is present? So we must use N? But if we don't use N? Then we might not get information? Actually, we have to guess words? And we know N is present? So yes, we should include N? So noise includes N? Correct? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""noise"" is good?

Any other options? Like ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? Which has T? As common letter? And U? Less common? Or ""knife""? K-N-I-F-E? F and K? Less common? So ""noise"" is better? Because O,I,S are more common.

So I choose ""noise"".

Therefore, the next guess: ""noise""

But wait: is ""noise"" a valid word? Yes, common.

So response: <guess>noise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed to be in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.
- N is present in the secret word but not in position 4 (-). Since position 5 is E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- C, R, and A are absent (x) and should be avoided.

For the second guess, we need to:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Include N but not in position 4 (to avoid redundant feedback). I've chosen to place N in position 1 to test a new location.
- Introduce new common vowels and consonants to maximize information, avoiding C, R, A.
- Select a valid English word ending with E.

The word ""noise"" fits these criteria:
- Position 1: N (tests N in position 1).
- Position 2: O (new vowel).
- Position 3: I (new vowel).
- Position 4: S (new consonant).
- Position 5: E (confirmed correct).

This guess may provide useful feedback on N's position (if N is in position 1, it will be ✓; otherwise, -) and reveal whether O, I, or S are present.",Guess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,sense,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and covers some of the most common letters in English (C, R, A, N, E).

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (in the word and correct position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and it is in the position 5 (since we used the 5th letter as E and it's correct). So the 5th letter of the secret word is E.
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position. It must be in one of the first four positions? But note: our word was ""crane"", which is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. So N is in the word but not at position 4. Since position 5 is taken by E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all. So we must avoid using C, R, A in the next guess.

Also, note that the word does not contain C, R, or A.

We know the 5th letter is E. So the word ends with E.

Our next guess should:
- Contain the letter N (since it's present, and we know it must be in positions 1, 2, or 3). But note: in our next guess, we should try to place N in different positions to test where it might be.
- Exclude the letters C, R, A.
- Include other common letters to get more information.

Moreover, we must keep in mind that E is fixed in position 5. So we can use E in position 5 again, but that's the same. We don't need to change that.

What are some words that end with E and contain N? And without C, R, A.

Also, we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present: C, R, A.

Let's think of words that fit:
- They have 5 letters, ending with E.
- Contain N (but not in the same position as before? We don't know the position of N yet, but we know it's not at position 4? Actually, the feedback was for N: it exists but not in position 4. But it could be in position 1,2,3? But note, the word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. Since position 5 is E, N must be in 1,2,3 or ... wait, position 4 is the only one we know it's not? Actually, we don't know: it could be in position 4? Wait, no: our previous word had N in position 4, and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, N cannot be in position 4 of the secret word? Or could it? Wait: the feedback says it is in the word but not in the correct position? Yes. So N is in the word, but not at position 4. That implies that N must be at positions 1,2,3, or ... 5? But position 5 is E, so it's fixed and cannot be N? Wait: we have E at position 5 as correct. So the secret word ends with E. Therefore, N cannot be at position 5. Then N must be in positions 1,2, or 3.

So, to recap:
- Secret word: _ _ _ _ E
- Contains the letter N in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.
- Does not contain C, R, A.

We have three positions to test for N.

But we also want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

We should try a word that has N in a different position (say position 1 or 2) and also introduces new common letters.

Possible words ending with E? And containing N, but without C, R, A.

Let me list some:
- STONE: S,T,O,N,E -> note: N is at position 4? But we must avoid position 4 for N because we know N is not at position 4? Actually, we don't know the secret word's N position. But if we use ""stone"", we have N at position 4 again? We want to avoid putting N in the same position? No, we can put N in a different position? But currently we know it's not at position 4? Actually, we can try putting N at position 1 or 2 to check? But in ""stone"", N is at position 4. So that might not help? Actually, we can use it: because if we put N in position 4 and if it gets marked as ""x"", that would be inconsistent? But since we already know N is not at position 4? We know that from the previous feedback? Actually, the previous feedback only says that in the word ""crane"", N was present but not in position 4. It doesn't say that the secret word cannot have N at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:

The feedback ""-"" for N in ""crane"" (which was at position 4) means that the secret word does contain the letter N, but not at position 4. Therefore, for the secret word, N must be at a different position (1,2,3, or maybe position 5? But position 5 is E). So we must look for positions 1,2,3.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put N in one of positions 1,2,3 to test? Or we can put it in a position we haven't tested? We haven't tested positions 1,2,3? Actually, we only tried position 4. So we can test in position 1 or 2 or 3? But we don't have to test all at once? We can choose one.

We should try to choose a word that has N in position 1? And then also introduce other letters.

Also, we know E is at the end. So the word ends with E.

Idea: we can use ""ONSET"" but ONSET has O,N,S,E,T. But O and T are new? And N is at position 2? And ends with E? But ""onset"" is five letters: O-N-S-E-T? But that doesn't end with E? It ends with T? So not ending with E? Wait, ONSET is O-N-S-E-T -> positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. We need the word to end with E? So position 5 must be E? So we require the word to end with E.

Wait, the word must be: ???E.

So we need words that end with E? And containing N? Without C,R,A.

Options:
- Consider ""LINE"": too short? It must be 5 letters. So: ""LINED""? Wait, but we need exactly 5 letters? No, we are guessing 5 letters? So we need a word that is exactly 5 letters and ends with E.

Examples: phone, stone, alone, shine, etc.

But ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. This has N at position 4? And ends with E? But N at position 4: we already know N is not at position 4? So if we guess ""stone"", then if the feedback for N is ""-"" again? Then we know N is not at 4 again? Wait, we already know N is not at 4? And let's see: we are going to put N at 4? Then the feedback for N might be:

If N is in the word and we put it at position 4, but the secret word doesn't have N at 4 (we already know that), then it should be ""-"" again? So it doesn't tell us anything new? So maybe we should avoid putting N at position 4? Therefore, we should put N in a position we haven't tried: position 1,2, or 3.

So let's think of words that:
- Have N in position 1 or 2 or 3?
- And end with E.
- Without C,R,A.

Let me try to find a word that ends with E? Also has N in position 1: 
Example: ""noise""? N-O-I-S-E? Wait, ends with E? Yes: N is at position 1? But note that ""noise"" has O and I and S? Also, note we can try ""niche""? N-I-C-H-E? Wait, but we cannot use C? Because C is excluded from the first guess feedback? We have C: x -> it's not in the word. So we cannot use C? So ""niche"" is invalid? Because it has C? Cannot use C,R,A.

So ""noise"" is N,O,I,S,E -> doesn't have C,R,A? And ends with E? And N at position 1? Okay.

Another option: ""niece""? N,I,E,C,E? Again, C is not allowed? So invalid? We cannot use C? So must avoid?

""noise"": N-O-I-S-E? No C,R,A? So okay.

But what about ""tinge""? T-I-N-G-E? Ends with E? And N is at position 3? That could be? So N is at position 3? And has T,I,G? Then we can test?

But note: we also may need to avoid duplicate letters? We don't know if the word has duplicate? So we can still use duplicate if we don't know? But for maximizing information, distinct letters might be better? But let's check the word ""stone""? That has position 4? But if we avoid putting N at 4? Then we might avoid ""stone"".

Let me consider ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? Then we are using N at the 3rd position?

We can think of:

- Option 1: Put N at position 1? -> e.g., ""noise"": N,O,I,S,E.
- Option 2: Put N at position 2? -> e.g., ""inkle""? Wait, is ""inkle"" a word? It is not common? Or ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? But note: ""unite"" ends with E? And N at position 2? And letters: U,N,I,T,E -> no C,R,A? Okay? But U is not that common? Or ""stage""? But stage has A? Avoid A? So invalid? ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E? But N is at position 4? Which we want to avoid? So no? ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E? N at position 4? Avoid? Similarly, ""phone"": P-H-O-N-E? N at 4? Avoid.

What about ""knife"": K-N-I-F-E? Yes? That would have N at position 2? And ends with E? And letters K,N,I,F,E? No C,R,A? Okay? And we can use that? Or ""snide"": S-N-I-D-E? Ends with E? N at position 2? S,N,I,D,E? No C,R,A? Okay.

Or ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W? Ends with W? Not E? So not.

Another idea: ""owine""? Not a word? 

Valid words: ""tinge"" (N at 3), ""noise"" (N at 1), ""knife"" (N at 2), ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Invalid? ""unite"" we considered.

Let me pick ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? 

Then the feedback might tell us about N: if we put N at position 3 and if the secret word has N at position 3, it would be ✓? Otherwise, if N is elsewhere, it would be ""-""? Or if not? But we know N is not at position 4? And we are testing position 3? So if we get a ""-"" for N, then N is not at position 3? But if we get a ✓? Then we know.

Alternatively, I think ""knife"" or ""noise"" are options? Also, common.

But note: we also have E in position 5? And we are repeating E? But that's okay.

I think ""noise"" is good: 
- First letter N: if N is at position 1, then ✓? Else if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know N is in the word? So if we get ""x"" for N? Then it can't be? Because N is present? Actually, if we put N at position 1 and the secret word has N at position 1? Then ✓? If the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get ""-""? Similarly, if at position 3? Then we get ""-""? Because position is wrong? So it doesn't tell us exactly? But we will get information about the position? But note: we are introducing O, I, S? Which are common.

Similarly, with ""tinge"": letters T,I,N,G,E? We are introducing T,I,G.

But note: we don't know if T,I,G are in the word? But that's the purpose? To test new letters.

Also, consider that E is already known? So we can ignore its feedback? Actually, we know E is at position 5? So we don't expect any feedback other than ✓? So we can focus on other positions? Actually, feedback for E should always be ✓? Because it's correct? So no new information? We can save a letter? But we must use E at the end? Actually, we have to? Because we know? So in the next guess, we must put E at the end? Therefore, we will get E: ✓? So we shouldn't waste a letter? But we are trying to test other letters? That's okay? So we are using the E? And then we have to guess?

So I propose ""noise""? Let me go with ""noise""? Or is there a better word?

We want maximum letter coverage? Common letters: S, T, L, N, O? We already know N is present? So we can include S and O? Also, T? How about ""stonk""? Not a word? Or ""stone""? But we avoid stone because it has N at 4? Which we already know is wrong? And the same as the previous guess? Actually, we can use ""stone"" but then we are putting N in position 4? Which we know is not correct? So it would be wasteful? Because if N is not at 4? Then we get ""-""? That's the same feedback? Doesn't help? So we avoid.

Therefore, let me pick ""noise""? 

But ""noise"": 
  N: let's see? Position 1? We don't know? 
  O: position 2?
  I: position 3?
  S: position 4?
  E: position 5: ✓ (we know)

Also, note: we have just used S and O? They are new? They haven't been tested? We don't know about S and O.

So let's do it.

So my next guess: ""noise""

But wait: feedback from first guess: we also know N is present? So we must use N? But if we don't use N? Then we might not get information? Actually, we have to guess words? And we know N is present? So yes, we should include N? So noise includes N? Correct? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""noise"" is good?

Any other options? Like ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? Which has T? As common letter? And U? Less common? Or ""knife""? K-N-I-F-E? F and K? Less common? So ""noise"" is better? Because O,I,S are more common.

So I choose ""noise"".

Therefore, the next guess: ""noise""

But wait: is ""noise"" a valid word? Yes, common.

So response: <guess>noise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed to be in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.
- N is present in the secret word but not in position 4 (-). Since position 5 is E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- C, R, and A are absent (x) and should be avoided.

For the second guess, we need to:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Include N but not in position 4 (to avoid redundant feedback). I've chosen to place N in position 1 to test a new location.
- Introduce new common vowels and consonants to maximize information, avoiding C, R, A.
- Select a valid English word ending with E.

The word ""noise"" fits these criteria:
- Position 1: N (tests N in position 1).
- Position 2: O (new vowel).
- Position 3: I (new vowel).
- Position 4: S (new consonant).
- Position 5: E (confirmed correct).

This guess may provide useful feedback on N's position (if N is in position 1, it will be ✓; otherwise, -) and reveal whether O, I, or S are present.

So we must avoid using C, R, A in the next guess.\n\nAlso, note that the word does not contain C, R, or A.\n\nWe know the 5th letter is E. So the word ends with E.\n\nOur next guess should:\n- Contain the letter N (since it\'s present, and we know it must be in positions 1, 2, or 3). But note: in our next guess, we should try to place N in different positions to test where it might be.\n- Exclude the letters C, R, A.\n- Include other common letters to get more information.\n\nMoreover, we must keep in mind that E is fixed in position 5. So we can use E in position 5 again, but that\'s the same. We don\'t need to change that.\n\nWhat are some words that end with E and contain N? And without C, R, A.\n\nAlso, we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present: C, R, A.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit:\n- They have 5 letters, ending with E.\n- Contain N (but not in the same position as before? We don\'t know the position of N yet, but we know it\'s not at position 4? Actually, the feedback was for N: it exists but not in position 4. But it could be in position 1,2,3? But note, the word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. Since position 5 is E, N must be in 1,2,3 or ... wait, position 4 is the only one we know it\'s not? Actually, we don\'t know: it could be in position 4? Wait, no: our previous word had N in position 4, and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, N cannot be in position 4 of the secret word? Or could it? Wait: the feedback says it is in the word but not in the correct position? Yes. So N is in the word, but not at position 4. That implies that N must be at positions 1,2,3, or ... 5? But position 5 is E, so it\'s fixed and cannot be N? Wait: we have E at position 5 as correct. So the secret word ends with E. Therefore, N cannot be at position 5. Then N must be in positions 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo, to recap:\n- Secret word: _ _ _ _ E\n- Contains the letter N in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.\n- Does not contain C, R, A.\n\nWe have three positions to test for N.\n\nBut we also want to cover other common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nWe should try a word that has N in a different position (say position 1 or 2) and also introduces new common letters.\n\nPossible words ending with E? And containing N, but without C, R, A.\n\nLet me list some:\n- STONE: S,T,O,N,E -> note: N is at position 4? But we must avoid position 4 for N because we know N is not at position 4? Actually, we don\'t know the secret word\'s N position. But if we use ""stone"", we have N at position 4 again? We want to avoid putting N in the same position? No, we can put N in a different position? But currently we know it\'s not at position 4? Actually, we can try putting N at position 1 or 2 to check? But in ""stone"", N is at position 4. So that might not help? Actually, we can use it: because if we put N in position 4 and if it gets marked as ""x"", that would be inconsistent? But since we already know N is not at position 4? We know that from the previous feedback? Actually, the previous feedback only says that in the word ""crane"", N was present but not in position 4. It doesn\'t say that the secret word cannot have N at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:\n\nThe feedback ""-"" for N in ""crane"" (which was at position 4) means that the secret word does contain the letter N, but not at position 4. Therefore, for the secret word, N must be at a different position (1,2,3, or maybe position 5? But position 5 is E). So we must look for positions 1,2,3.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we should put N in one of positions 1,2,3 to test? Or we can put it in a position we haven\'t tested? We haven\'t tested positions 1,2,3? Actually, we only tried position 4. So we can test in position 1 or 2 or 3? But we don\'t have to test all at once? We can choose one.\n\nWe should try to choose a word that has N in position 1? And then also introduce other letters.\n\nAlso, we know E is at the end. So the word ends with E.\n\nIdea: we can use ""ONSET"" but ONSET has O,N,S,E,T. But O and T are new? And N is at position 2? And ends with E? But ""onset"" is five letters: O-N-S-E-T? But that doesn\'t end with E? It ends with T? So not ending with E? Wait, ONSET is O-N-S-E-T -> positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. We need the word to end with E? So position 5 must be E? So we require the word to end with E.\n\nWait, the word must be: ???E.\n\nSo we need words that end with E? And containing N? Without C,R,A.\n\nOptions:\n- Consider ""LINE"": too short? It must be 5 letters. So: ""LINED""? Wait, but we need exactly 5 letters? No, we are guessing 5 letters? So we need a word that is exactly 5 letters and ends with E.\n\nExamples: phone, stone, alone, shine, etc.\n\nBut ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. This has N at position 4? And ends with E? But N at position 4: we already know N is not at position 4? So if we guess ""stone"", then if the feedback for N is ""-"" again? Then we know N is not at 4 again? Wait, we already know N is not at 4? And let\'s see: we are going to put N at 4? Then the feedback for N might be:\n\nIf N is in the word and we put it at position 4, but the secret word doesn\'t have N at 4 (we already know that), then it should be ""-"" again? So it doesn\'t tell us anything new? So maybe we should avoid putting N at position 4? Therefore, we should put N in a position we haven\'t tried: position 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo let\'s think of words that:\n- Have N in position 1 or 2 or 3?\n- And end with E.\n- Without C,R,A.\n\nLet me try to find a word that ends with E? Also has N in position 1: \nExample: ""noise""? N-O-I-S-E? Wait, ends with E? Yes: N is at position 1? But note that ""noise"" has O and I and S? Also, note we can try ""niche""? N-I-C-H-E? Wait, but we cannot use C? Because C is excluded from the first guess feedback? We have C: x -> it\'s not in the word. So we cannot use C? So ""niche"" is invalid? Because it has C? Cannot use C,R,A.\n\nSo ""noise"" is N,O,I,S,E -> doesn\'t have C,R,A? And ends with E? And N at position 1? Okay.\n\nAnother option: ""niece""? N,I,E,C,E? Again, C is not allowed? So invalid? We cannot use C? So must avoid?\n\n""noise"": N-O-I-S-E? No C,R,A? So okay.\n\nBut what about ""tinge""? T-I-N-G-E? Ends with E? And N is at position 3? That could be? So N is at position 3? And has T,I,G? Then we can test?\n\nBut note: we also may need to avoid duplicate letters? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate? So we can still use duplicate if we don\'t know? But for maximizing information, distinct letters might be better? But let\'s check the word ""stone""? That has position 4? But if we avoid putting N at 4? Then we might avoid ""stone"".\n\nLet me consider ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? Then we are using N at the 3rd position?\n\nWe can think of:\n\n- Option 1: Put N at position 1? -> e.g., ""noise"": N,O,I,S,E.\n- Option 2: Put N at position 2? -> e.g., ""inkle""? Wait, is ""inkle"" a word? It is not common? Or ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? But note: ""unite"" ends with E? And N at position 2? And letters: U,N,I,T,E -> no C,R,A? Okay? But U is not that common? Or ""stage""? But stage has A? Avoid A? So invalid? ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E? But N is at position 4? Which we want to avoid? So no? ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E? N at position 4? Avoid? Similarly, ""phone"": P-H-O-N-E? N at 4? Avoid.\n\nWhat about ""knife"": K-N-I-F-E? Yes? That would have N at position 2? And ends with E? And letters K,N,I,F,E? No C,R,A? Okay? And we can use that? Or ""snide"": S-N-I-D-E? Ends with E? N at position 2? S,N,I,D,E? No C,R,A? Okay.\n\nOr ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W? Ends with W? Not E? So not.\n\nAnother idea: ""owine""? Not a word? \n\nValid words: ""tinge"" (N at 3), ""noise"" (N at 1), ""knife"" (N at 2), ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Invalid? ""unite"" we considered.\n\nLet me pick ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? \n\nThen the feedback might tell us about N: if we put N at position 3 and if the secret word has N at position 3, it would be ✓? Otherwise, if N is elsewhere, it would be ""-""? Or if not? But we know N is not at position 4? And we are testing position 3? So if we get a ""-"" for N, then N is not at position 3? But if we get a ✓? Then we know.\n\nAlternatively, I think ""knife"" or ""noise"" are options? Also, common.\n\nBut note: we also have E in position 5? And we are repeating E? But that\'s okay.\n\nI think ""noise"" is good: \n- First letter N: if N is at position 1, then ✓? Else if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know N is in the word? So if we get ""x"" for N? Then it can\'t be? Because N is present? Actually, if we put N at position 1 and the secret word has N at position 1? Then ✓? If the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get ""-""? Similarly, if at position 3? Then we get ""-""? Because position is wrong? So it doesn\'t tell us exactly? But we will get information about the position? But note: we are introducing O, I, S? Which are common.\n\nSimilarly, with ""tinge"": letters T,I,N,G,E? We are introducing T,I,G.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if T,I,G are in the word? But that\'s the purpose? To test new letters.\n\nAlso, consider that E is already known? So we can ignore its feedback? Actually, we know E is at position 5? So we don\'t expect any feedback other than ✓? So we can focus on other positions? Actually, feedback for E should always be ✓? Because it\'s correct? So no new information? We can save a letter? But we must use E at the end? Actually, we have to? Because we know? So in the next guess, we must put E at the end? Therefore, we will get E: ✓? So we shouldn\'t waste a letter? But we are trying to test other letters? That\'s okay? So we are using the E? And then we have to guess?\n\nSo I propose ""noise""? Let me go with ""noise""? Or is there a better word?\n\nWe want maximum letter coverage? Common letters: S, T, L, N, O? We already know N is present? So we can include S and O? Also, T? How about ""stonk""? Not a word? Or ""stone""? But we avoid stone because it has N at 4? Which we already know is wrong? And the same as the previous guess? Actually, we can use ""stone"" but then we are putting N in position 4? Which we know is not correct? So it would be wasteful? Because if N is not at 4? Then we get ""-""? That\'s the same feedback? Doesn\'t help? So we avoid.\n\nTherefore, let me pick ""noise""? \n\nBut ""noise"": \n  N: let\'s see? Position 1? We don\'t know? \n  O: position 2?\n  I: position 3?\n  S: position 4?\n  E: position 5: ✓ (we know)\n\nAlso, note: we have just used S and O? They are new? They haven\'t been tested? We don\'t know about S and O.\n\nSo let\'s do it.\n\nSo my next guess: ""noise""\n\nBut wait: feedback from first guess: we also know N is present? So we must use N? But if we don\'t use N? Then we might not get information? Actually, we have to guess words? And we know N is present? So yes, we should include N? So noise includes N? Correct? Yes.\n\nTherefore, I think ""noise"" is good?\n\nAny other options? Like ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? Which has T? As common letter? And U? Less common? Or ""knife""? K-N-I-F-E? F and K? Less common? So ""noise"" is better? Because O,I,S are more common.\n\nSo I choose ""noise"".\n\nTherefore, the next guess: ""noise""\n\nBut wait: is ""noise"" a valid word? Yes, common.\n\nSo response: <guess>noise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is confirmed to be in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.\n- N is present in the secret word but not in position 4 (-). Since position 5 is E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.\n- C, R, and A are absent (x) and should be avoided.\n\nFor the second guess, we need to:\n- Keep E in position 5.\n- Include N but not in position 4 (to avoid redundant feedback). I\'ve chosen to place N in position 1 to test a new location.\n- Introduce new common vowels and consonants to maximize information, avoiding C, R, A.\n- Select a valid English word ending with E.\n\nThe word ""noise"" fits these criteria:\n- Position 1: N (tests N in position 1).\n- Position 2: O (new vowel).\n- Position 3: I (new vowel).\n- Position 4: S (new consonant).\n- Position 5: E (confirmed correct).\n\nThis guess may provide useful feedback on N\'s position (if N is in position 1, it will be ✓; otherwise, -) and reveal whether O, I, or S are present.\n\n<guess>noise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

Guess 2: ""noise""
- N: - (in the word but wrong position) — so N is not at position 1 (since we placed it there in this guess)
- O: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct position) — so S is in the word and at position 4
- E: ✓ (correct position) — we already knew E is at position 5

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word ends with E (position 5) and has S at position 4. So the word pattern is: _ _ _ S E

2. N is in the word but not in position 4 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2). Since the word is _ _ _ S E, the positions for N are 2 or 3 (because position 4 is S and 5 is E).

3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, O, I.

4. We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, S. We know E and S are in the word (with fixed positions) and N is in the word (but position unknown, either 2 or 3). The absent letters are C, R, A, O, I.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
- Keep S in position 4 and E in position 5: so the last two letters must be S and E.
- Include N in either position 2 or 3 to test its location (since it must be in one of these two positions).
- Avoid using C, R, A, O, I.
- Use new common letters to get more information.

Given the pattern: _ _ _ S E

We need to fill the first three positions. We know N must be in position 2 or 3. So we can try to put N in position 2 and see what happens? Or in position 3? We can choose one.

Also, we need to choose letters for the remaining positions that are common and not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, O, I.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover more common letters.

Possible words:

Option 1: Put N in position 2: then the word is _ N _ S E

What can the first letter be? And the third?

For example:
- ""unuse""? But U is not excluded? But ""unuse"" is not a common word? And it has U? Also, we have to avoid O and I? But U is allowed? But ""unuse"" might not be valid? Let's think of valid words.

Better: ""tense"": T E N S E? But E is repeated? And we have E at position 5? But we are putting E at position 2? Wait, no: ""tense"" is T-E-N-S-E. So position 1: T, 2: E, 3: N, 4: S, 5: E. But we know position 5 is E? And position 4 is S? So that matches? But we are putting E at position 2? That might be okay? But we don't know if E is at position 2? Also, we have two E's? But the secret word might have two E's? We don't know? But from previous feedback, we only know about one E? But it could have more? So it's possible? But we are using E at position 2? That might be a good test? Because if E is at position 2? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know E is at position 5? So if we put E at position 2 and it's not in the word elsewhere? Then we get ""x""? But we know E is at 5? So if we get a ""-"" for E at position 2? That would mean there is another E? But if we get ""x""? Then no other E? So it gives information? But we are using a letter that we know is in the word? But we are testing for duplicate? That might be okay? But we are also testing N at position 3? Because in ""tense"", N is at position 3? And we know N must be at 2 or 3? So if we put N at 3? Then if it's correct? We get ✓? Otherwise, if N is at 2? Then we get ""-""? Because it's in the word but wrong position? So that would tell us? Also, we are introducing T? Which is common.

But ""tense"" has two E's? And we are using E at position 2? Which might not be necessary? But it's a valid word.

Another option: ""dense"": D-E-N-S-E? Same issue? E at position 2.

To avoid using E again? We can try a word without E in the first positions? But we have to have S and E at the end? So the word must end with SE? So the third letter can be anything? But we are putting N at 2 or 3.

What if we put N at position 3? Then the word is _ _ N S E

For example: ""bunse""? Not a word? ""punse""? Not? ""minse""? Not common? ""winse""? Not? ""linse""? Not? ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Excluded? ""dunse""? Not? ""gunse""? Not? ""hunse""? Not? ""sunse""? Not? ""tunse""? Not? ""vinse""? Not? ""winse""? Not? ""yense""? Not? 

Actually, common words: ""tense"", ""dense"", ""sense"" (but ""sense"" is S-E-N-S-E? Then position 1: S? But we are going to put S at position 4? And we know S is at position 4? So if we put S at position 1? Then we are testing if S is at position 1? But we know S is at position 4? So if there is another S? Then we might get ""-"" for S at position 1? Or if not? Then ""x""? But we don't know? So it might be okay? But ""sense"" has S at 1 and 4? And E at 2? And N at 3? So ""sense"": S(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5). But we know position 4 is S? And position 5 is E? So that matches? But we are using S at position 1? And E at position 2? So we are testing for duplicate S and E? But we don't know if they are duplicated? So it might be a good test? But we are using N at position 3? Which is one of the possibilities.

But we have to avoid O and I? ""sense"" doesn't have O or I? So okay? But we are using S and E again? Which we know are in the word? But we are testing their positions? So it might be acceptable? But we are not introducing many new letters? Only S and E? But we are testing for duplicates? And N at 3.

But we need to introduce new letters? Because we have only tested a few? So maybe better to use a word with new letters? For example, ""tense"" introduces T? Which is new? And E? But we are testing E at position 2? So it's new information? Similarly, ""dense"" introduces D? Etc.

But let's list possible words that end with ""se"" and have N in position 2 or 3? And without C,R,A,O,I.

For position 2 (N at 2): pattern _ N _ S E

Possible words:
- tense: T E N S E -> T is new? E is known? But we are testing E at position 2? Also, N at 3? Wait, no: in ""tense"", N is at position 3? And the pattern is _ N _ S E? If we want N at position 2? Then it should be _ N _ S E? So for ""tense"", it is T at 1, E at 2, N at 3? So that's not N at 2? It's N at 3? So for N at position 2? We need a word like: ? N ? S E

For example: ""unsee""? U N S E E? But that's U at 1, N at 2, S at 3, E at 4, E at 5? But we know position 4 must be S? And position 5 E? So in ""unsee"", position 4 is E? Not S? So invalid? Because we must have S at position 4? So the word must have S at position 4? So the pattern is fixed: positions 4 and 5 are S and E? So the first three are free? But we are putting N at 2 or 3.

So for N at position 2: the word is [letter1] N [letter3] S E

What are valid words? For example:
- ""unset"": U N S E T? But that ends with T? Not E? So position 5 is T? But we need position 5 to be E? So not? ""unsew""? U N S E W? Ends with W? Not E? ""unsay""? But has A? Excluded? And ends with Y? Not E? ""unseam""? Too long? ""unseal""? Too long? ""unseam"" is 6? So not 5? 

Actually, I can't think of a common word with pattern ? N ? S E? Because the ? at position 3 must be a letter that with S and E? But the word must be a valid English word? Like ""anise""? But ""anise"" has A? Excluded? ""unite"" is not? ""knife"" is not? 

Perhaps ""insee""? Not a word? ""ensew""? Not? 

So maybe there are no common words with N at position 2 and ending with SE? So we must put N at position 3? Then pattern: _ _ N S E

Then we have words like:
- tense: T E N S E -> T at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? But E at 2? And we are using E again? But it's okay? Because we are testing if E is at position 2? Also, we are putting N at 3? Which is one of the possibilities? So if N is at 3? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if N is at 2? Then we get ""-"" for N? Because it's in the word but wrong position? So that tells us N is at 2? So it's good? And we introduce T? Which is new? So ""tense"" seems good? 

Other options: ""dense"": D E N S E? Similarly? D at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Introduces D? 

""sense"": S E N S E? S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Introduces S at 1? But we know S is at 4? So if we get a ✓ for S at 1? Then there is another S? If we get ""-""? Then S is at 4 only? But we are using S at 1? And we know S is at 4? So if we get ""x"" for S at 1? That would mean no other S? But if we get ""-""? Then there is another S? So it gives information? But we are using a slot? 

But we have to choose? Also, ""mense""? Not common? ""pense""? Not? ""lense""? L E N S E? Which is a word? Lens with e? But sometimes accepted? 

""tense"" is a common word? So I think ""tense"" is a good choice? 

But we are using E at position 2? Which might be redundant? But it tests for duplicate E? And we don't know if there is another E? So it's new information? 

Alternatively, we can avoid using E? But then we might not have many options? For example, ""bunse"" is not a word? ""gunse"" not? ""minse"" not? ""winse"" not? ""lynse"" not? ""punse"" not? 

So I think ""tense"" is acceptable? 

But let's see if there is a word without E in the first positions? For example, ""towns""? But ends with S? Not SE? ""downs""? Not? 

Another idea: ""minus""? But ends with S? Not E? ""finis""? Ends with S? Not E? 

So I think we have to use a word that has E at the end? And we are stuck with the pattern? So ""tense"" or ""dense"" or ""sense"" are the options? 

Among these, ""tense"" introduces T? Which is common? And we haven't used T? So better than ""sense"" which introduces S again? But ""sense"" has S at 1? Which is new? But we are testing S? 

But I think ""tense"" is better? Because T is a new letter? 

So I choose ""tense"". 

Therefore, the next guess: ""tense""

But let's double-check the pattern: we are putting N at position 3? And we know N must be at 2 or 3? So if we get feedback for N: 
- If N is at position 3? Then ✓? 
- If N is at position 2? Then we get ""-"" for N? Because it's in the word but not at 3? 

Also, for E at position 2: 
- If E is at position 2? Then ✓? 
- If not? Then if there is another E? We get ""-""? Or if not? We get ""x""? 

And T at position 1: 
- If T is in the word? And at position 1? Then ✓? 
- If T is in the word but not at 1? Then ""-""? 
- If T is not in the word? Then ""x""? 

So we get information about T and E? And N? 

Also, we avoid C,R,A,O,I? 

So it seems good? 

Therefore, I go with ""tense"". 

<guess>tense</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)**  
  - E is in the correct position (position 5).  
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - C, R, A are absent.

- **Guess 2: ""noise"" → Feedback: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)**  
  - S is in the correct position (position 4).  
  - E is still in the correct position (position 5).  
  - N is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - O and I are absent.

### Key Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ _ S E` (S in position 4, E in position 5).
2. N is present but not in positions 1 or 4. Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, N must be in position 2 or 3.
3. Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I (cannot be used).
4. Present letters: N, S, E (with S and E fixed in positions 4 and 5).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Test N in position 3 (since position 1 was already tested and ruled out, and position 4 is fixed as S). If N is in position 3, it will show ✓; if not, it will show - (indicating N is in position 2).
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, D, L) to maximize information, avoiding absent letters.
- Use a valid 5-letter word ending in ""SE"" (to match the fixed S and E).

The word **""tense""** fits perfectly:
- **T**: New common consonant (tests position 1).
- **E**: In position 2 (tests for duplicate E; if E is here, it shows ✓; if not, it may show - or x).
- **N**: In position 3 (tests if N is here or in position 2).
- **S**: Fixed in position 4 (will show ✓).
- **E**: Fixed in position 5 (will show ✓).

This guess efficiently narrows down N's position and checks for duplicate E while introducing T.

<guess>tense</guess>",tense,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

Guess 2: ""noise""
- N: - (in the word but wrong position) — so N is not at position 1 (since we placed it there in this guess)
- O: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct position) — so S is in the word and at position 4
- E: ✓ (correct position) — we already knew E is at position 5

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word ends with E (position 5) and has S at position 4. So the word pattern is: _ _ _ S E

2. N is in the word but not in position 4 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2). Since the word is _ _ _ S E, the positions for N are 2 or 3 (because position 4 is S and 5 is E).

3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, O, I.

4. We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, S. We know E and S are in the word (with fixed positions) and N is in the word (but position unknown, either 2 or 3). The absent letters are C, R, A, O, I.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
- Keep S in position 4 and E in position 5: so the last two letters must be S and E.
- Include N in either position 2 or 3 to test its location (since it must be in one of these two positions).
- Avoid using C, R, A, O, I.
- Use new common letters to get more information.

Given the pattern: _ _ _ S E

We need to fill the first three positions. We know N must be in position 2 or 3. So we can try to put N in position 2 and see what happens? Or in position 3? We can choose one.

Also, we need to choose letters for the remaining positions that are common and not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, O, I.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover more common letters.

Possible words:

Option 1: Put N in position 2: then the word is _ N _ S E

What can the first letter be? And the third?

For example:
- ""unuse""? But U is not excluded? But ""unuse"" is not a common word? And it has U? Also, we have to avoid O and I? But U is allowed? But ""unuse"" might not be valid? Let's think of valid words.

Better: ""tense"": T E N S E? But E is repeated? And we have E at position 5? But we are putting E at position 2? Wait, no: ""tense"" is T-E-N-S-E. So position 1: T, 2: E, 3: N, 4: S, 5: E. But we know position 5 is E? And position 4 is S? So that matches? But we are putting E at position 2? That might be okay? But we don't know if E is at position 2? Also, we have two E's? But the secret word might have two E's? We don't know? But from previous feedback, we only know about one E? But it could have more? So it's possible? But we are using E at position 2? That might be a good test? Because if E is at position 2? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know E is at position 5? So if we put E at position 2 and it's not in the word elsewhere? Then we get ""x""? But we know E is at 5? So if we get a ""-"" for E at position 2? That would mean there is another E? But if we get ""x""? Then no other E? So it gives information? But we are using a letter that we know is in the word? But we are testing for duplicate? That might be okay? But we are also testing N at position 3? Because in ""tense"", N is at position 3? And we know N must be at 2 or 3? So if we put N at 3? Then if it's correct? We get ✓? Otherwise, if N is at 2? Then we get ""-""? Because it's in the word but wrong position? So that would tell us? Also, we are introducing T? Which is common.

But ""tense"" has two E's? And we are using E at position 2? Which might not be necessary? But it's a valid word.

Another option: ""dense"": D-E-N-S-E? Same issue? E at position 2.

To avoid using E again? We can try a word without E in the first positions? But we have to have S and E at the end? So the word must end with SE? So the third letter can be anything? But we are putting N at 2 or 3.

What if we put N at position 3? Then the word is _ _ N S E

For example: ""bunse""? Not a word? ""punse""? Not? ""minse""? Not common? ""winse""? Not? ""linse""? Not? ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Excluded? ""dunse""? Not? ""gunse""? Not? ""hunse""? Not? ""sunse""? Not? ""tunse""? Not? ""vinse""? Not? ""winse""? Not? ""yense""? Not? 

Actually, common words: ""tense"", ""dense"", ""sense"" (but ""sense"" is S-E-N-S-E? Then position 1: S? But we are going to put S at position 4? And we know S is at position 4? So if we put S at position 1? Then we are testing if S is at position 1? But we know S is at position 4? So if there is another S? Then we might get ""-"" for S at position 1? Or if not? Then ""x""? But we don't know? So it might be okay? But ""sense"" has S at 1 and 4? And E at 2? And N at 3? So ""sense"": S(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5). But we know position 4 is S? And position 5 is E? So that matches? But we are using S at position 1? And E at position 2? So we are testing for duplicate S and E? But we don't know if they are duplicated? So it might be a good test? But we are using N at position 3? Which is one of the possibilities.

But we have to avoid O and I? ""sense"" doesn't have O or I? So okay? But we are using S and E again? Which we know are in the word? But we are testing their positions? So it might be acceptable? But we are not introducing many new letters? Only S and E? But we are testing for duplicates? And N at 3.

But we need to introduce new letters? Because we have only tested a few? So maybe better to use a word with new letters? For example, ""tense"" introduces T? Which is new? And E? But we are testing E at position 2? So it's new information? Similarly, ""dense"" introduces D? Etc.

But let's list possible words that end with ""se"" and have N in position 2 or 3? And without C,R,A,O,I.

For position 2 (N at 2): pattern _ N _ S E

Possible words:
- tense: T E N S E -> T is new? E is known? But we are testing E at position 2? Also, N at 3? Wait, no: in ""tense"", N is at position 3? And the pattern is _ N _ S E? If we want N at position 2? Then it should be _ N _ S E? So for ""tense"", it is T at 1, E at 2, N at 3? So that's not N at 2? It's N at 3? So for N at position 2? We need a word like: ? N ? S E

For example: ""unsee""? U N S E E? But that's U at 1, N at 2, S at 3, E at 4, E at 5? But we know position 4 must be S? And position 5 E? So in ""unsee"", position 4 is E? Not S? So invalid? Because we must have S at position 4? So the word must have S at position 4? So the pattern is fixed: positions 4 and 5 are S and E? So the first three are free? But we are putting N at 2 or 3.

So for N at position 2: the word is [letter1] N [letter3] S E

What are valid words? For example:
- ""unset"": U N S E T? But that ends with T? Not E? So position 5 is T? But we need position 5 to be E? So not? ""unsew""? U N S E W? Ends with W? Not E? ""unsay""? But has A? Excluded? And ends with Y? Not E? ""unseam""? Too long? ""unseal""? Too long? ""unseam"" is 6? So not 5? 

Actually, I can't think of a common word with pattern ? N ? S E? Because the ? at position 3 must be a letter that with S and E? But the word must be a valid English word? Like ""anise""? But ""anise"" has A? Excluded? ""unite"" is not? ""knife"" is not? 

Perhaps ""insee""? Not a word? ""ensew""? Not? 

So maybe there are no common words with N at position 2 and ending with SE? So we must put N at position 3? Then pattern: _ _ N S E

Then we have words like:
- tense: T E N S E -> T at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? But E at 2? And we are using E again? But it's okay? Because we are testing if E is at position 2? Also, we are putting N at 3? Which is one of the possibilities? So if N is at 3? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if N is at 2? Then we get ""-"" for N? Because it's in the word but wrong position? So that tells us N is at 2? So it's good? And we introduce T? Which is new? So ""tense"" seems good? 

Other options: ""dense"": D E N S E? Similarly? D at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Introduces D? 

""sense"": S E N S E? S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Introduces S at 1? But we know S is at 4? So if we get a ✓ for S at 1? Then there is another S? If we get ""-""? Then S is at 4 only? But we are using S at 1? And we know S is at 4? So if we get ""x"" for S at 1? That would mean no other S? But if we get ""-""? Then there is another S? So it gives information? But we are using a slot? 

But we have to choose? Also, ""mense""? Not common? ""pense""? Not? ""lense""? L E N S E? Which is a word? Lens with e? But sometimes accepted? 

""tense"" is a common word? So I think ""tense"" is a good choice? 

But we are using E at position 2? Which might be redundant? But it tests for duplicate E? And we don't know if there is another E? So it's new information? 

Alternatively, we can avoid using E? But then we might not have many options? For example, ""bunse"" is not a word? ""gunse"" not? ""minse"" not? ""winse"" not? ""lynse"" not? ""punse"" not? 

So I think ""tense"" is acceptable? 

But let's see if there is a word without E in the first positions? For example, ""towns""? But ends with S? Not SE? ""downs""? Not? 

Another idea: ""minus""? But ends with S? Not E? ""finis""? Ends with S? Not E? 

So I think we have to use a word that has E at the end? And we are stuck with the pattern? So ""tense"" or ""dense"" or ""sense"" are the options? 

Among these, ""tense"" introduces T? Which is common? And we haven't used T? So better than ""sense"" which introduces S again? But ""sense"" has S at 1? Which is new? But we are testing S? 

But I think ""tense"" is better? Because T is a new letter? 

So I choose ""tense"". 

Therefore, the next guess: ""tense""

But let's double-check the pattern: we are putting N at position 3? And we know N must be at 2 or 3? So if we get feedback for N: 
- If N is at position 3? Then ✓? 
- If N is at position 2? Then we get ""-"" for N? Because it's in the word but not at 3? 

Also, for E at position 2: 
- If E is at position 2? Then ✓? 
- If not? Then if there is another E? We get ""-""? Or if not? We get ""x""? 

And T at position 1: 
- If T is in the word? And at position 1? Then ✓? 
- If T is in the word but not at 1? Then ""-""? 
- If T is not in the word? Then ""x""? 

So we get information about T and E? And N? 

Also, we avoid C,R,A,O,I? 

So it seems good? 

Therefore, I go with ""tense"". 

<guess>tense</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)**  
  - E is in the correct position (position 5).  
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - C, R, A are absent.

- **Guess 2: ""noise"" → Feedback: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)**  
  - S is in the correct position (position 4).  
  - E is still in the correct position (position 5).  
  - N is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - O and I are absent.

### Key Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ _ S E` (S in position 4, E in position 5).
2. N is present but not in positions 1 or 4. Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, N must be in position 2 or 3.
3. Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I (cannot be used).
4. Present letters: N, S, E (with S and E fixed in positions 4 and 5).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Test N in position 3 (since position 1 was already tested and ruled out, and position 4 is fixed as S). If N is in position 3, it will show ✓; if not, it will show - (indicating N is in position 2).
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, D, L) to maximize information, avoiding absent letters.
- Use a valid 5-letter word ending in ""SE"" (to match the fixed S and E).

The word **""tense""** fits perfectly:
- **T**: New common consonant (tests position 1).
- **E**: In position 2 (tests for duplicate E; if E is here, it shows ✓; if not, it may show - or x).
- **N**: In position 3 (tests if N is here or in position 2).
- **S**: Fixed in position 4 (will show ✓).
- **E**: Fixed in position 5 (will show ✓).

This guess efficiently narrows down N's position and checks for duplicate E while introducing T.",Guess 3: tense -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,sense,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and covers some of the most common letters in English (C, R, A, N, E).

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (in the word and correct position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and it is in the position 5 (since we used the 5th letter as E and it's correct). So the 5th letter of the secret word is E.
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position. It must be in one of the first four positions? But note: our word was ""crane"", which is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. So N is in the word but not at position 4. Since position 5 is taken by E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all. So we must avoid using C, R, A in the next guess.

Also, note that the word does not contain C, R, or A.

We know the 5th letter is E. So the word ends with E.

Our next guess should:
- Contain the letter N (since it's present, and we know it must be in positions 1, 2, or 3). But note: in our next guess, we should try to place N in different positions to test where it might be.
- Exclude the letters C, R, A.
- Include other common letters to get more information.

Moreover, we must keep in mind that E is fixed in position 5. So we can use E in position 5 again, but that's the same. We don't need to change that.

What are some words that end with E and contain N? And without C, R, A.

Also, we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present: C, R, A.

Let's think of words that fit:
- They have 5 letters, ending with E.
- Contain N (but not in the same position as before? We don't know the position of N yet, but we know it's not at position 4? Actually, the feedback was for N: it exists but not in position 4. But it could be in position 1,2,3? But note, the word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. Since position 5 is E, N must be in 1,2,3 or ... wait, position 4 is the only one we know it's not? Actually, we don't know: it could be in position 4? Wait, no: our previous word had N in position 4, and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, N cannot be in position 4 of the secret word? Or could it? Wait: the feedback says it is in the word but not in the correct position? Yes. So N is in the word, but not at position 4. That implies that N must be at positions 1,2,3, or ... 5? But position 5 is E, so it's fixed and cannot be N? Wait: we have E at position 5 as correct. So the secret word ends with E. Therefore, N cannot be at position 5. Then N must be in positions 1,2, or 3.

So, to recap:
- Secret word: _ _ _ _ E
- Contains the letter N in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.
- Does not contain C, R, A.

We have three positions to test for N.

But we also want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

We should try a word that has N in a different position (say position 1 or 2) and also introduces new common letters.

Possible words ending with E? And containing N, but without C, R, A.

Let me list some:
- STONE: S,T,O,N,E -> note: N is at position 4? But we must avoid position 4 for N because we know N is not at position 4? Actually, we don't know the secret word's N position. But if we use ""stone"", we have N at position 4 again? We want to avoid putting N in the same position? No, we can put N in a different position? But currently we know it's not at position 4? Actually, we can try putting N at position 1 or 2 to check? But in ""stone"", N is at position 4. So that might not help? Actually, we can use it: because if we put N in position 4 and if it gets marked as ""x"", that would be inconsistent? But since we already know N is not at position 4? We know that from the previous feedback? Actually, the previous feedback only says that in the word ""crane"", N was present but not in position 4. It doesn't say that the secret word cannot have N at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:

The feedback ""-"" for N in ""crane"" (which was at position 4) means that the secret word does contain the letter N, but not at position 4. Therefore, for the secret word, N must be at a different position (1,2,3, or maybe position 5? But position 5 is E). So we must look for positions 1,2,3.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put N in one of positions 1,2,3 to test? Or we can put it in a position we haven't tested? We haven't tested positions 1,2,3? Actually, we only tried position 4. So we can test in position 1 or 2 or 3? But we don't have to test all at once? We can choose one.

We should try to choose a word that has N in position 1? And then also introduce other letters.

Also, we know E is at the end. So the word ends with E.

Idea: we can use ""ONSET"" but ONSET has O,N,S,E,T. But O and T are new? And N is at position 2? And ends with E? But ""onset"" is five letters: O-N-S-E-T? But that doesn't end with E? It ends with T? So not ending with E? Wait, ONSET is O-N-S-E-T -> positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. We need the word to end with E? So position 5 must be E? So we require the word to end with E.

Wait, the word must be: ???E.

So we need words that end with E? And containing N? Without C,R,A.

Options:
- Consider ""LINE"": too short? It must be 5 letters. So: ""LINED""? Wait, but we need exactly 5 letters? No, we are guessing 5 letters? So we need a word that is exactly 5 letters and ends with E.

Examples: phone, stone, alone, shine, etc.

But ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. This has N at position 4? And ends with E? But N at position 4: we already know N is not at position 4? So if we guess ""stone"", then if the feedback for N is ""-"" again? Then we know N is not at 4 again? Wait, we already know N is not at 4? And let's see: we are going to put N at 4? Then the feedback for N might be:

If N is in the word and we put it at position 4, but the secret word doesn't have N at 4 (we already know that), then it should be ""-"" again? So it doesn't tell us anything new? So maybe we should avoid putting N at position 4? Therefore, we should put N in a position we haven't tried: position 1,2, or 3.

So let's think of words that:
- Have N in position 1 or 2 or 3?
- And end with E.
- Without C,R,A.

Let me try to find a word that ends with E? Also has N in position 1: 
Example: ""noise""? N-O-I-S-E? Wait, ends with E? Yes: N is at position 1? But note that ""noise"" has O and I and S? Also, note we can try ""niche""? N-I-C-H-E? Wait, but we cannot use C? Because C is excluded from the first guess feedback? We have C: x -> it's not in the word. So we cannot use C? So ""niche"" is invalid? Because it has C? Cannot use C,R,A.

So ""noise"" is N,O,I,S,E -> doesn't have C,R,A? And ends with E? And N at position 1? Okay.

Another option: ""niece""? N,I,E,C,E? Again, C is not allowed? So invalid? We cannot use C? So must avoid?

""noise"": N-O-I-S-E? No C,R,A? So okay.

But what about ""tinge""? T-I-N-G-E? Ends with E? And N is at position 3? That could be? So N is at position 3? And has T,I,G? Then we can test?

But note: we also may need to avoid duplicate letters? We don't know if the word has duplicate? So we can still use duplicate if we don't know? But for maximizing information, distinct letters might be better? But let's check the word ""stone""? That has position 4? But if we avoid putting N at 4? Then we might avoid ""stone"".

Let me consider ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? Then we are using N at the 3rd position?

We can think of:

- Option 1: Put N at position 1? -> e.g., ""noise"": N,O,I,S,E.
- Option 2: Put N at position 2? -> e.g., ""inkle""? Wait, is ""inkle"" a word? It is not common? Or ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? But note: ""unite"" ends with E? And N at position 2? And letters: U,N,I,T,E -> no C,R,A? Okay? But U is not that common? Or ""stage""? But stage has A? Avoid A? So invalid? ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E? But N is at position 4? Which we want to avoid? So no? ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E? N at position 4? Avoid? Similarly, ""phone"": P-H-O-N-E? N at 4? Avoid.

What about ""knife"": K-N-I-F-E? Yes? That would have N at position 2? And ends with E? And letters K,N,I,F,E? No C,R,A? Okay? And we can use that? Or ""snide"": S-N-I-D-E? Ends with E? N at position 2? S,N,I,D,E? No C,R,A? Okay.

Or ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W? Ends with W? Not E? So not.

Another idea: ""owine""? Not a word? 

Valid words: ""tinge"" (N at 3), ""noise"" (N at 1), ""knife"" (N at 2), ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Invalid? ""unite"" we considered.

Let me pick ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? 

Then the feedback might tell us about N: if we put N at position 3 and if the secret word has N at position 3, it would be ✓? Otherwise, if N is elsewhere, it would be ""-""? Or if not? But we know N is not at position 4? And we are testing position 3? So if we get a ""-"" for N, then N is not at position 3? But if we get a ✓? Then we know.

Alternatively, I think ""knife"" or ""noise"" are options? Also, common.

But note: we also have E in position 5? And we are repeating E? But that's okay.

I think ""noise"" is good: 
- First letter N: if N is at position 1, then ✓? Else if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know N is in the word? So if we get ""x"" for N? Then it can't be? Because N is present? Actually, if we put N at position 1 and the secret word has N at position 1? Then ✓? If the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get ""-""? Similarly, if at position 3? Then we get ""-""? Because position is wrong? So it doesn't tell us exactly? But we will get information about the position? But note: we are introducing O, I, S? Which are common.

Similarly, with ""tinge"": letters T,I,N,G,E? We are introducing T,I,G.

But note: we don't know if T,I,G are in the word? But that's the purpose? To test new letters.

Also, consider that E is already known? So we can ignore its feedback? Actually, we know E is at position 5? So we don't expect any feedback other than ✓? So we can focus on other positions? Actually, feedback for E should always be ✓? Because it's correct? So no new information? We can save a letter? But we must use E at the end? Actually, we have to? Because we know? So in the next guess, we must put E at the end? Therefore, we will get E: ✓? So we shouldn't waste a letter? But we are trying to test other letters? That's okay? So we are using the E? And then we have to guess?

So I propose ""noise""? Let me go with ""noise""? Or is there a better word?

We want maximum letter coverage? Common letters: S, T, L, N, O? We already know N is present? So we can include S and O? Also, T? How about ""stonk""? Not a word? Or ""stone""? But we avoid stone because it has N at 4? Which we already know is wrong? And the same as the previous guess? Actually, we can use ""stone"" but then we are putting N in position 4? Which we know is not correct? So it would be wasteful? Because if N is not at 4? Then we get ""-""? That's the same feedback? Doesn't help? So we avoid.

Therefore, let me pick ""noise""? 

But ""noise"": 
  N: let's see? Position 1? We don't know? 
  O: position 2?
  I: position 3?
  S: position 4?
  E: position 5: ✓ (we know)

Also, note: we have just used S and O? They are new? They haven't been tested? We don't know about S and O.

So let's do it.

So my next guess: ""noise""

But wait: feedback from first guess: we also know N is present? So we must use N? But if we don't use N? Then we might not get information? Actually, we have to guess words? And we know N is present? So yes, we should include N? So noise includes N? Correct? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""noise"" is good?

Any other options? Like ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? Which has T? As common letter? And U? Less common? Or ""knife""? K-N-I-F-E? F and K? Less common? So ""noise"" is better? Because O,I,S are more common.

So I choose ""noise"".

Therefore, the next guess: ""noise""

But wait: is ""noise"" a valid word? Yes, common.

So response: <guess>noise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed to be in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.
- N is present in the secret word but not in position 4 (-). Since position 5 is E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- C, R, and A are absent (x) and should be avoided.

For the second guess, we need to:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Include N but not in position 4 (to avoid redundant feedback). I've chosen to place N in position 1 to test a new location.
- Introduce new common vowels and consonants to maximize information, avoiding C, R, A.
- Select a valid English word ending with E.

The word ""noise"" fits these criteria:
- Position 1: N (tests N in position 1).
- Position 2: O (new vowel).
- Position 3: I (new vowel).
- Position 4: S (new consonant).
- Position 5: E (confirmed correct).

This guess may provide useful feedback on N's position (if N is in position 1, it will be ✓; otherwise, -) and reveal whether O, I, or S are present.

<guess>noise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

Guess 2: ""noise""
- N: - (in the word but wrong position) — so N is not at position 1 (since we placed it there in this guess)
- O: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct position) — so S is in the word and at position 4
- E: ✓ (correct position) — we already knew E is at position 5

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word ends with E (position 5) and has S at position 4. So the word pattern is: _ _ _ S E

2. N is in the word but not in position 4 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2). Since the word is _ _ _ S E, the positions for N are 2 or 3 (because position 4 is S and 5 is E).

3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, O, I.

4. We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, S. We know E and S are in the word (with fixed positions) and N is in the word (but position unknown, either 2 or 3). The absent letters are C, R, A, O, I.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
- Keep S in position 4 and E in position 5: so the last two letters must be S and E.
- Include N in either position 2 or 3 to test its location (since it must be in one of these two positions).
- Avoid using C, R, A, O, I.
- Use new common letters to get more information.

Given the pattern: _ _ _ S E

We need to fill the first three positions. We know N must be in position 2 or 3. So we can try to put N in position 2 and see what happens? Or in position 3? We can choose one.

Also, we need to choose letters for the remaining positions that are common and not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, O, I.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover more common letters.

Possible words:

Option 1: Put N in position 2: then the word is _ N _ S E

What can the first letter be? And the third?

For example:
- ""unuse""? But U is not excluded? But ""unuse"" is not a common word? And it has U? Also, we have to avoid O and I? But U is allowed? But ""unuse"" might not be valid? Let's think of valid words.

Better: ""tense"": T E N S E? But E is repeated? And we have E at position 5? But we are putting E at position 2? Wait, no: ""tense"" is T-E-N-S-E. So position 1: T, 2: E, 3: N, 4: S, 5: E. But we know position 5 is E? And position 4 is S? So that matches? But we are putting E at position 2? That might be okay? But we don't know if E is at position 2? Also, we have two E's? But the secret word might have two E's? We don't know? But from previous feedback, we only know about one E? But it could have more? So it's possible? But we are using E at position 2? That might be a good test? Because if E is at position 2? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know E is at position 5? So if we put E at position 2 and it's not in the word elsewhere? Then we get ""x""? But we know E is at 5? So if we get a ""-"" for E at position 2? That would mean there is another E? But if we get ""x""? Then no other E? So it gives information? But we are using a letter that we know is in the word? But we are testing for duplicate? That might be okay? But we are also testing N at position 3? Because in ""tense"", N is at position 3? And we know N must be at 2 or 3? So if we put N at 3? Then if it's correct? We get ✓? Otherwise, if N is at 2? Then we get ""-""? Because it's in the word but wrong position? So that would tell us? Also, we are introducing T? Which is common.

But ""tense"" has two E's? And we are using E at position 2? Which might not be necessary? But it's a valid word.

Another option: ""dense"": D-E-N-S-E? Same issue? E at position 2.

To avoid using E again? We can try a word without E in the first positions? But we have to have S and E at the end? So the word must end with SE? So the third letter can be anything? But we are putting N at 2 or 3.

What if we put N at position 3? Then the word is _ _ N S E

For example: ""bunse""? Not a word? ""punse""? Not? ""minse""? Not common? ""winse""? Not? ""linse""? Not? ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Excluded? ""dunse""? Not? ""gunse""? Not? ""hunse""? Not? ""sunse""? Not? ""tunse""? Not? ""vinse""? Not? ""winse""? Not? ""yense""? Not? 

Actually, common words: ""tense"", ""dense"", ""sense"" (but ""sense"" is S-E-N-S-E? Then position 1: S? But we are going to put S at position 4? And we know S is at position 4? So if we put S at position 1? Then we are testing if S is at position 1? But we know S is at position 4? So if there is another S? Then we might get ""-"" for S at position 1? Or if not? Then ""x""? But we don't know? So it might be okay? But ""sense"" has S at 1 and 4? And E at 2? And N at 3? So ""sense"": S(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5). But we know position 4 is S? And position 5 is E? So that matches? But we are using S at position 1? And E at position 2? So we are testing for duplicate S and E? But we don't know if they are duplicated? So it might be a good test? But we are using N at position 3? Which is one of the possibilities.

But we have to avoid O and I? ""sense"" doesn't have O or I? So okay? But we are using S and E again? Which we know are in the word? But we are testing their positions? So it might be acceptable? But we are not introducing many new letters? Only S and E? But we are testing for duplicates? And N at 3.

But we need to introduce new letters? Because we have only tested a few? So maybe better to use a word with new letters? For example, ""tense"" introduces T? Which is new? And E? But we are testing E at position 2? So it's new information? Similarly, ""dense"" introduces D? Etc.

But let's list possible words that end with ""se"" and have N in position 2 or 3? And without C,R,A,O,I.

For position 2 (N at 2): pattern _ N _ S E

Possible words:
- tense: T E N S E -> T is new? E is known? But we are testing E at position 2? Also, N at 3? Wait, no: in ""tense"", N is at position 3? And the pattern is _ N _ S E? If we want N at position 2? Then it should be _ N _ S E? So for ""tense"", it is T at 1, E at 2, N at 3? So that's not N at 2? It's N at 3? So for N at position 2? We need a word like: ? N ? S E

For example: ""unsee""? U N S E E? But that's U at 1, N at 2, S at 3, E at 4, E at 5? But we know position 4 must be S? And position 5 E? So in ""unsee"", position 4 is E? Not S? So invalid? Because we must have S at position 4? So the word must have S at position 4? So the pattern is fixed: positions 4 and 5 are S and E? So the first three are free? But we are putting N at 2 or 3.

So for N at position 2: the word is [letter1] N [letter3] S E

What are valid words? For example:
- ""unset"": U N S E T? But that ends with T? Not E? So position 5 is T? But we need position 5 to be E? So not? ""unsew""? U N S E W? Ends with W? Not E? ""unsay""? But has A? Excluded? And ends with Y? Not E? ""unseam""? Too long? ""unseal""? Too long? ""unseam"" is 6? So not 5? 

Actually, I can't think of a common word with pattern ? N ? S E? Because the ? at position 3 must be a letter that with S and E? But the word must be a valid English word? Like ""anise""? But ""anise"" has A? Excluded? ""unite"" is not? ""knife"" is not? 

Perhaps ""insee""? Not a word? ""ensew""? Not? 

So maybe there are no common words with N at position 2 and ending with SE? So we must put N at position 3? Then pattern: _ _ N S E

Then we have words like:
- tense: T E N S E -> T at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? But E at 2? And we are using E again? But it's okay? Because we are testing if E is at position 2? Also, we are putting N at 3? Which is one of the possibilities? So if N is at 3? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if N is at 2? Then we get ""-"" for N? Because it's in the word but wrong position? So that tells us N is at 2? So it's good? And we introduce T? Which is new? So ""tense"" seems good? 

Other options: ""dense"": D E N S E? Similarly? D at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Introduces D? 

""sense"": S E N S E? S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Introduces S at 1? But we know S is at 4? So if we get a ✓ for S at 1? Then there is another S? If we get ""-""? Then S is at 4 only? But we are using S at 1? And we know S is at 4? So if we get ""x"" for S at 1? That would mean no other S? But if we get ""-""? Then there is another S? So it gives information? But we are using a slot? 

But we have to choose? Also, ""mense""? Not common? ""pense""? Not? ""lense""? L E N S E? Which is a word? Lens with e? But sometimes accepted? 

""tense"" is a common word? So I think ""tense"" is a good choice? 

But we are using E at position 2? Which might be redundant? But it tests for duplicate E? And we don't know if there is another E? So it's new information? 

Alternatively, we can avoid using E? But then we might not have many options? For example, ""bunse"" is not a word? ""gunse"" not? ""minse"" not? ""winse"" not? ""lynse"" not? ""punse"" not? 

So I think ""tense"" is acceptable? 

But let's see if there is a word without E in the first positions? For example, ""towns""? But ends with S? Not SE? ""downs""? Not? 

Another idea: ""minus""? But ends with S? Not E? ""finis""? Ends with S? Not E? 

So I think we have to use a word that has E at the end? And we are stuck with the pattern? So ""tense"" or ""dense"" or ""sense"" are the options? 

Among these, ""tense"" introduces T? Which is common? And we haven't used T? So better than ""sense"" which introduces S again? But ""sense"" has S at 1? Which is new? But we are testing S? 

But I think ""tense"" is better? Because T is a new letter? 

So I choose ""tense"". 

Therefore, the next guess: ""tense""

But let's double-check the pattern: we are putting N at position 3? And we know N must be at 2 or 3? So if we get feedback for N: 
- If N is at position 3? Then ✓? 
- If N is at position 2? Then we get ""-"" for N? Because it's in the word but not at 3? 

Also, for E at position 2: 
- If E is at position 2? Then ✓? 
- If not? Then if there is another E? We get ""-""? Or if not? We get ""x""? 

And T at position 1: 
- If T is in the word? And at position 1? Then ✓? 
- If T is in the word but not at 1? Then ""-""? 
- If T is not in the word? Then ""x""? 

So we get information about T and E? And N? 

Also, we avoid C,R,A,O,I? 

So it seems good? 

Therefore, I go with ""tense"". 

<guess>tense</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)**  
  - E is in the correct position (position 5).  
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - C, R, A are absent.

- **Guess 2: ""noise"" → Feedback: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)**  
  - S is in the correct position (position 4).  
  - E is still in the correct position (position 5).  
  - N is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - O and I are absent.

### Key Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ _ S E` (S in position 4, E in position 5).
2. N is present but not in positions 1 or 4. Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, N must be in position 2 or 3.
3. Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I (cannot be used).
4. Present letters: N, S, E (with S and E fixed in positions 4 and 5).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Test N in position 3 (since position 1 was already tested and ruled out, and position 4 is fixed as S). If N is in position 3, it will show ✓; if not, it will show - (indicating N is in position 2).
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, D, L) to maximize information, avoiding absent letters.
- Use a valid 5-letter word ending in ""SE"" (to match the fixed S and E).

The word **""tense""** fits perfectly:
- **T**: New common consonant (tests position 1).
- **E**: In position 2 (tests for duplicate E; if E is here, it shows ✓; if not, it may show - or x).
- **N**: In position 3 (tests if N is here or in position 2).
- **S**: Fixed in position 4 (will show ✓).
- **E**: Fixed in position 5 (will show ✓).

This guess efficiently narrows down N's position and checks for duplicate E while introducing T.

The letter E is in the word and it is in the position 5 (since we used the 5th letter as E and it\'s correct). So the 5th letter of the secret word is E.\n2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position. It must be in one of the first four positions? But note: our word was ""crane"", which is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. So N is in the word but not at position 4. Since position 5 is taken by E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.\n3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all. So we must avoid using C, R, A in the next guess.\n\nAlso, note that the word does not contain C, R, or A.\n\nWe know the 5th letter is E. So the word ends with E.\n\nOur next guess should:\n- Contain the letter N (since it\'s present, and we know it must be in positions 1, 2, or 3). But note: in our next guess, we should try to place N in different positions to test where it might be.\n- Exclude the letters C, R, A.\n- Include other common letters to get more information.\n\nMoreover, we must keep in mind that E is fixed in position 5. So we can use E in position 5 again, but that\'s the same. We don\'t need to change that.\n\nWhat are some words that end with E and contain N? And without C, R, A.\n\nAlso, we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present: C, R, A.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit:\n- They have 5 letters, ending with E.\n- Contain N (but not in the same position as before? We don\'t know the position of N yet, but we know it\'s not at position 4? Actually, the feedback was for N: it exists but not in position 4. But it could be in position 1,2,3? But note, the word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. Since position 5 is E, N must be in 1,2,3 or ... wait, position 4 is the only one we know it\'s not? Actually, we don\'t know: it could be in position 4? Wait, no: our previous word had N in position 4, and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, N cannot be in position 4 of the secret word? Or could it? Wait: the feedback says it is in the word but not in the correct position? Yes. So N is in the word, but not at position 4. That implies that N must be at positions 1,2,3, or ... 5? But position 5 is E, so it\'s fixed and cannot be N? Wait: we have E at position 5 as correct. So the secret word ends with E. Therefore, N cannot be at position 5. Then N must be in positions 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo, to recap:\n- Secret word: _ _ _ _ E\n- Contains the letter N in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.\n- Does not contain C, R, A.\n\nWe have three positions to test for N.\n\nBut we also want to cover other common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nWe should try a word that has N in a different position (say position 1 or 2) and also introduces new common letters.\n\nPossible words ending with E? And containing N, but without C, R, A.\n\nLet me list some:\n- STONE: S,T,O,N,E -> note: N is at position 4? But we must avoid position 4 for N because we know N is not at position 4? Actually, we don\'t know the secret word\'s N position. But if we use ""stone"", we have N at position 4 again? We want to avoid putting N in the same position? No, we can put N in a different position? But currently we know it\'s not at position 4? Actually, we can try putting N at position 1 or 2 to check? But in ""stone"", N is at position 4. So that might not help? Actually, we can use it: because if we put N in position 4 and if it gets marked as ""x"", that would be inconsistent? But since we already know N is not at position 4? We know that from the previous feedback? Actually, the previous feedback only says that in the word ""crane"", N was present but not in position 4. It doesn\'t say that the secret word cannot have N at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:\n\nThe feedback ""-"" for N in ""crane"" (which was at position 4) means that the secret word does contain the letter N, but not at position 4. Therefore, for the secret word, N must be at a different position (1,2,3, or maybe position 5? But position 5 is E). So we must look for positions 1,2,3.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we should put N in one of positions 1,2,3 to test? Or we can put it in a position we haven\'t tested? We haven\'t tested positions 1,2,3? Actually, we only tried position 4. So we can test in position 1 or 2 or 3? But we don\'t have to test all at once? We can choose one.\n\nWe should try to choose a word that has N in position 1? And then also introduce other letters.\n\nAlso, we know E is at the end. So the word ends with E.\n\nIdea: we can use ""ONSET"" but ONSET has O,N,S,E,T. But O and T are new? And N is at position 2? And ends with E? But ""onset"" is five letters: O-N-S-E-T? But that doesn\'t end with E? It ends with T? So not ending with E? Wait, ONSET is O-N-S-E-T -> positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. We need the word to end with E? So position 5 must be E? So we require the word to end with E.\n\nWait, the word must be: ???E.\n\nSo we need words that end with E? And containing N? Without C,R,A.\n\nOptions:\n- Consider ""LINE"": too short? It must be 5 letters. So: ""LINED""? Wait, but we need exactly 5 letters? No, we are guessing 5 letters? So we need a word that is exactly 5 letters and ends with E.\n\nExamples: phone, stone, alone, shine, etc.\n\nBut ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. This has N at position 4? And ends with E? But N at position 4: we already know N is not at position 4? So if we guess ""stone"", then if the feedback for N is ""-"" again? Then we know N is not at 4 again? Wait, we already know N is not at 4? And let\'s see: we are going to put N at 4? Then the feedback for N might be:\n\nIf N is in the word and we put it at position 4, but the secret word doesn\'t have N at 4 (we already know that), then it should be ""-"" again? So it doesn\'t tell us anything new? So maybe we should avoid putting N at position 4? Therefore, we should put N in a position we haven\'t tried: position 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo let\'s think of words that:\n- Have N in position 1 or 2 or 3?\n- And end with E.\n- Without C,R,A.\n\nLet me try to find a word that ends with E? Also has N in position 1: \nExample: ""noise""? N-O-I-S-E? Wait, ends with E? Yes: N is at position 1? But note that ""noise"" has O and I and S? Also, note we can try ""niche""? N-I-C-H-E? Wait, but we cannot use C? Because C is excluded from the first guess feedback? We have C: x -> it\'s not in the word. So we cannot use C? So ""niche"" is invalid? Because it has C? Cannot use C,R,A.\n\nSo ""noise"" is N,O,I,S,E -> doesn\'t have C,R,A? And ends with E? And N at position 1? Okay.\n\nAnother option: ""niece""? N,I,E,C,E? Again, C is not allowed? So invalid? We cannot use C? So must avoid?\n\n""noise"": N-O-I-S-E? No C,R,A? So okay.\n\nBut what about ""tinge""? T-I-N-G-E? Ends with E? And N is at position 3? That could be? So N is at position 3? And has T,I,G? Then we can test?\n\nBut note: we also may need to avoid duplicate letters? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate? So we can still use duplicate if we don\'t know? But for maximizing information, distinct letters might be better? But let\'s check the word ""stone""? That has position 4? But if we avoid putting N at 4? Then we might avoid ""stone"".\n\nLet me consider ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? Then we are using N at the 3rd position?\n\nWe can think of:\n\n- Option 1: Put N at position 1? -> e.g., ""noise"": N,O,I,S,E.\n- Option 2: Put N at position 2? -> e.g., ""inkle""? Wait, is ""inkle"" a word? It is not common? Or ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? But note: ""unite"" ends with E? And N at position 2? And letters: U,N,I,T,E -> no C,R,A? Okay? But U is not that common? Or ""stage""? But stage has A? Avoid A? So invalid? ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E? But N is at position 4? Which we want to avoid? So no? ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E? N at position 4? Avoid? Similarly, ""phone"": P-H-O-N-E? N at 4? Avoid.\n\nWhat about ""knife"": K-N-I-F-E? Yes? That would have N at position 2? And ends with E? And letters K,N,I,F,E? No C,R,A? Okay? And we can use that? Or ""snide"": S-N-I-D-E? Ends with E? N at position 2? S,N,I,D,E? No C,R,A? Okay.\n\nOr ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W? Ends with W? Not E? So not.\n\nAnother idea: ""owine""? Not a word? \n\nValid words: ""tinge"" (N at 3), ""noise"" (N at 1), ""knife"" (N at 2), ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Invalid? ""unite"" we considered.\n\nLet me pick ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? \n\nThen the feedback might tell us about N: if we put N at position 3 and if the secret word has N at position 3, it would be ✓? Otherwise, if N is elsewhere, it would be ""-""? Or if not? But we know N is not at position 4? And we are testing position 3? So if we get a ""-"" for N, then N is not at position 3? But if we get a ✓? Then we know.\n\nAlternatively, I think ""knife"" or ""noise"" are options? Also, common.\n\nBut note: we also have E in position 5? And we are repeating E? But that\'s okay.\n\nI think ""noise"" is good: \n- First letter N: if N is at position 1, then ✓? Else if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know N is in the word? So if we get ""x"" for N? Then it can\'t be? Because N is present? Actually, if we put N at position 1 and the secret word has N at position 1? Then ✓? If the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get ""-""? Similarly, if at position 3? Then we get ""-""? Because position is wrong? So it doesn\'t tell us exactly? But we will get information about the position? But note: we are introducing O, I, S? Which are common.\n\nSimilarly, with ""tinge"": letters T,I,N,G,E? We are introducing T,I,G.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if T,I,G are in the word? But that\'s the purpose? To test new letters.\n\nAlso, consider that E is already known? So we can ignore its feedback? Actually, we know E is at position 5? So we don\'t expect any feedback other than ✓? So we can focus on other positions? Actually, feedback for E should always be ✓? Because it\'s correct? So no new information? We can save a letter? But we must use E at the end? Actually, we have to? Because we know? So in the next guess, we must put E at the end? Therefore, we will get E: ✓? So we shouldn\'t waste a letter? But we are trying to test other letters? That\'s okay? So we are using the E? And then we have to guess?\n\nSo I propose ""noise""? Let me go with ""noise""? Or is there a better word?\n\nWe want maximum letter coverage? Common letters: S, T, L, N, O? We already know N is present? So we can include S and O? Also, T? How about ""stonk""? Not a word? Or ""stone""? But we avoid stone because it has N at 4? Which we already know is wrong? And the same as the previous guess? Actually, we can use ""stone"" but then we are putting N in position 4? Which we know is not correct? So it would be wasteful? Because if N is not at 4? Then we get ""-""? That\'s the same feedback? Doesn\'t help? So we avoid.\n\nTherefore, let me pick ""noise""? \n\nBut ""noise"": \n  N: let\'s see? Position 1? We don\'t know? \n  O: position 2?\n  I: position 3?\n  S: position 4?\n  E: position 5: ✓ (we know)\n\nAlso, note: we have just used S and O? They are new? They haven\'t been tested? We don\'t know about S and O.\n\nSo let\'s do it.\n\nSo my next guess: ""noise""\n\nBut wait: feedback from first guess: we also know N is present? So we must use N? But if we don\'t use N? Then we might not get information? Actually, we have to guess words? And we know N is present? So yes, we should include N? So noise includes N? Correct? Yes.\n\nTherefore, I think ""noise"" is good?\n\nAny other options? Like ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? Which has T? As common letter? And U? Less common? Or ""knife""? K-N-I-F-E? F and K? Less common? So ""noise"" is better? Because O,I,S are more common.\n\nSo I choose ""noise"".\n\nTherefore, the next guess: ""noise""\n\nBut wait: is ""noise"" a valid word? Yes, common.\n\nSo response: <guess>noise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is confirmed to be in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.\n- N is present in the secret word but not in position 4 (-). Since position 5 is E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.\n- C, R, and A are absent (x) and should be avoided.\n\nFor the second guess, we need to:\n- Keep E in position 5.\n- Include N but not in position 4 (to avoid redundant feedback). I\'ve chosen to place N in position 1 to test a new location.\n- Introduce new common vowels and consonants to maximize information, avoiding C, R, A.\n- Select a valid English word ending with E.\n\nThe word ""noise"" fits these criteria:\n- Position 1: N (tests N in position 1).\n- Position 2: O (new vowel).\n- Position 3: I (new vowel).\n- Position 4: S (new consonant).\n- Position 5: E (confirmed correct).\n\nThis guess may provide useful feedback on N\'s position (if N is in position 1, it will be ✓; otherwise, -) and reveal whether O, I, or S are present.\n\n<guess>noise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- E: ✓ (correct position)\n\nGuess 2: ""noise""\n- N: - (in the word but wrong position) — so N is not at position 1 (since we placed it there in this guess)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: ✓ (correct position) — so S is in the word and at position 4\n- E: ✓ (correct position) — we already knew E is at position 5\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The secret word ends with E (position 5) and has S at position 4. So the word pattern is: _ _ _ S E\n\n2. N is in the word but not in position 4 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2). Since the word is _ _ _ S E, the positions for N are 2 or 3 (because position 4 is S and 5 is E).\n\n3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, O, I.\n\n4. We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, S. We know E and S are in the word (with fixed positions) and N is in the word (but position unknown, either 2 or 3). The absent letters are C, R, A, O, I.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we need to:\n- Keep S in position 4 and E in position 5: so the last two letters must be S and E.\n- Include N in either position 2 or 3 to test its location (since it must be in one of these two positions).\n- Avoid using C, R, A, O, I.\n- Use new common letters to get more information.\n\nGiven the pattern: _ _ _ S E\n\nWe need to fill the first three positions. We know N must be in position 2 or 3. So we can try to put N in position 2 and see what happens? Or in position 3? We can choose one.\n\nAlso, we need to choose letters for the remaining positions that are common and not excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, O, I.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover more common letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption 1: Put N in position 2: then the word is _ N _ S E\n\nWhat can the first letter be? And the third?\n\nFor example:\n- ""unuse""? But U is not excluded? But ""unuse"" is not a common word? And it has U? Also, we have to avoid O and I? But U is allowed? But ""unuse"" might not be valid? Let\'s think of valid words.\n\nBetter: ""tense"": T E N S E? But E is repeated? And we have E at position 5? But we are putting E at position 2? Wait, no: ""tense"" is T-E-N-S-E. So position 1: T, 2: E, 3: N, 4: S, 5: E. But we know position 5 is E? And position 4 is S? So that matches? But we are putting E at position 2? That might be okay? But we don\'t know if E is at position 2? Also, we have two E\'s? But the secret word might have two E\'s? We don\'t know? But from previous feedback, we only know about one E? But it could have more? So it\'s possible? But we are using E at position 2? That might be a good test? Because if E is at position 2? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know E is at position 5? So if we put E at position 2 and it\'s not in the word elsewhere? Then we get ""x""? But we know E is at 5? So if we get a ""-"" for E at position 2? That would mean there is another E? But if we get ""x""? Then no other E? So it gives information? But we are using a letter that we know is in the word? But we are testing for duplicate? That might be okay? But we are also testing N at position 3? Because in ""tense"", N is at position 3? And we know N must be at 2 or 3? So if we put N at 3? Then if it\'s correct? We get ✓? Otherwise, if N is at 2? Then we get ""-""? Because it\'s in the word but wrong position? So that would tell us? Also, we are introducing T? Which is common.\n\nBut ""tense"" has two E\'s? And we are using E at position 2? Which might not be necessary? But it\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""dense"": D-E-N-S-E? Same issue? E at position 2.\n\nTo avoid using E again? We can try a word without E in the first positions? But we have to have S and E at the end? So the word must end with SE? So the third letter can be anything? But we are putting N at 2 or 3.\n\nWhat if we put N at position 3? Then the word is _ _ N S E\n\nFor example: ""bunse""? Not a word? ""punse""? Not? ""minse""? Not common? ""winse""? Not? ""linse""? Not? ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Excluded? ""dunse""? Not? ""gunse""? Not? ""hunse""? Not? ""sunse""? Not? ""tunse""? Not? ""vinse""? Not? ""winse""? Not? ""yense""? Not? \n\nActually, common words: ""tense"", ""dense"", ""sense"" (but ""sense"" is S-E-N-S-E? Then position 1: S? But we are going to put S at position 4? And we know S is at position 4? So if we put S at position 1? Then we are testing if S is at position 1? But we know S is at position 4? So if there is another S? Then we might get ""-"" for S at position 1? Or if not? Then ""x""? But we don\'t know? So it might be okay? But ""sense"" has S at 1 and 4? And E at 2? And N at 3? So ""sense"": S(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5). But we know position 4 is S? And position 5 is E? So that matches? But we are using S at position 1? And E at position 2? So we are testing for duplicate S and E? But we don\'t know if they are duplicated? So it might be a good test? But we are using N at position 3? Which is one of the possibilities.\n\nBut we have to avoid O and I? ""sense"" doesn\'t have O or I? So okay? But we are using S and E again? Which we know are in the word? But we are testing their positions? So it might be acceptable? But we are not introducing many new letters? Only S and E? But we are testing for duplicates? And N at 3.\n\nBut we need to introduce new letters? Because we have only tested a few? So maybe better to use a word with new letters? For example, ""tense"" introduces T? Which is new? And E? But we are testing E at position 2? So it\'s new information? Similarly, ""dense"" introduces D? Etc.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words that end with ""se"" and have N in position 2 or 3? And without C,R,A,O,I.\n\nFor position 2 (N at 2): pattern _ N _ S E\n\nPossible words:\n- tense: T E N S E -> T is new? E is known? But we are testing E at position 2? Also, N at 3? Wait, no: in ""tense"", N is at position 3? And the pattern is _ N _ S E? If we want N at position 2? Then it should be _ N _ S E? So for ""tense"", it is T at 1, E at 2, N at 3? So that\'s not N at 2? It\'s N at 3? So for N at position 2? We need a word like: ? N ? S E\n\nFor example: ""unsee""? U N S E E? But that\'s U at 1, N at 2, S at 3, E at 4, E at 5? But we know position 4 must be S? And position 5 E? So in ""unsee"", position 4 is E? Not S? So invalid? Because we must have S at position 4? So the word must have S at position 4? So the pattern is fixed: positions 4 and 5 are S and E? So the first three are free? But we are putting N at 2 or 3.\n\nSo for N at position 2: the word is [letter1] N [letter3] S E\n\nWhat are valid words? For example:\n- ""unset"": U N S E T? But that ends with T? Not E? So position 5 is T? But we need position 5 to be E? So not? ""unsew""? U N S E W? Ends with W? Not E? ""unsay""? But has A? Excluded? And ends with Y? Not E? ""unseam""? Too long? ""unseal""? Too long? ""unseam"" is 6? So not 5? \n\nActually, I can\'t think of a common word with pattern ? N ? S E? Because the ? at position 3 must be a letter that with S and E? But the word must be a valid English word? Like ""anise""? But ""anise"" has A? Excluded? ""unite"" is not? ""knife"" is not? \n\nPerhaps ""insee""? Not a word? ""ensew""? Not? \n\nSo maybe there are no common words with N at position 2 and ending with SE? So we must put N at position 3? Then pattern: _ _ N S E\n\nThen we have words like:\n- tense: T E N S E -> T at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? But E at 2? And we are using E again? But it\'s okay? Because we are testing if E is at position 2? Also, we are putting N at 3? Which is one of the possibilities? So if N is at 3? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if N is at 2? Then we get ""-"" for N? Because it\'s in the word but wrong position? So that tells us N is at 2? So it\'s good? And we introduce T? Which is new? So ""tense"" seems good? \n\nOther options: ""dense"": D E N S E? Similarly? D at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Introduces D? \n\n""sense"": S E N S E? S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Introduces S at 1? But we know S is at 4? So if we get a ✓ for S at 1? Then there is another S? If we get ""-""? Then S is at 4 only? But we are using S at 1? And we know S is at 4? So if we get ""x"" for S at 1? That would mean no other S? But if we get ""-""? Then there is another S? So it gives information? But we are using a slot? \n\nBut we have to choose? Also, ""mense""? Not common? ""pense""? Not? ""lense""? L E N S E? Which is a word? Lens with e? But sometimes accepted? \n\n""tense"" is a common word? So I think ""tense"" is a good choice? \n\nBut we are using E at position 2? Which might be redundant? But it tests for duplicate E? And we don\'t know if there is another E? So it\'s new information? \n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using E? But then we might not have many options? For example, ""bunse"" is not a word? ""gunse"" not? ""minse"" not? ""winse"" not? ""lynse"" not? ""punse"" not? \n\nSo I think ""tense"" is acceptable? \n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word without E in the first positions? For example, ""towns""? But ends with S? Not SE? ""downs""? Not? \n\nAnother idea: ""minus""? But ends with S? Not E? ""finis""? Ends with S? Not E? \n\nSo I think we have to use a word that has E at the end? And we are stuck with the pattern? So ""tense"" or ""dense"" or ""sense"" are the options? \n\nAmong these, ""tense"" introduces T? Which is common? And we haven\'t used T? So better than ""sense"" which introduces S again? But ""sense"" has S at 1? Which is new? But we are testing S? \n\nBut I think ""tense"" is better? Because T is a new letter? \n\nSo I choose ""tense"". \n\nTherefore, the next guess: ""tense""\n\nBut let\'s double-check the pattern: we are putting N at position 3? And we know N must be at 2 or 3? So if we get feedback for N: \n- If N is at position 3? Then ✓? \n- If N is at position 2? Then we get ""-"" for N? Because it\'s in the word but not at 3? \n\nAlso, for E at position 2: \n- If E is at position 2? Then ✓? \n- If not? Then if there is another E? We get ""-""? Or if not? We get ""x""? \n\nAnd T at position 1: \n- If T is in the word? And at position 1? Then ✓? \n- If T is in the word but not at 1? Then ""-""? \n- If T is not in the word? Then ""x""? \n\nSo we get information about T and E? And N? \n\nAlso, we avoid C,R,A,O,I? \n\nSo it seems good? \n\nTherefore, I go with ""tense"". \n\n<guess>tense</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)**  \n  - E is in the correct position (position 5).  \n  - N is in the word but not in position 4.  \n  - C, R, A are absent.\n\n- **Guess 2: ""noise"" → Feedback: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)**  \n  - S is in the correct position (position 4).  \n  - E is still in the correct position (position 5).  \n  - N is in the word but not in position 1.  \n  - O and I are absent.\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ _ S E` (S in position 4, E in position 5).\n2. N is present but not in positions 1 or 4. Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, N must be in position 2 or 3.\n3. Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I (cannot be used).\n4. Present letters: N, S, E (with S and E fixed in positions 4 and 5).\n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n- Test N in position 3 (since position 1 was already tested and ruled out, and position 4 is fixed as S). If N is in position 3, it will show ✓; if not, it will show - (indicating N is in position 2).\n- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, D, L) to maximize information, avoiding absent letters.\n- Use a valid 5-letter word ending in ""SE"" (to match the fixed S and E).\n\nThe word **""tense""** fits perfectly:\n- **T**: New common consonant (tests position 1).\n- **E**: In position 2 (tests for duplicate E; if E is here, it shows ✓; if not, it may show - or x).\n- **N**: In position 3 (tests if N is here or in position 2).\n- **S**: Fixed in position 4 (will show ✓).\n- **E**: Fixed in position 5 (will show ✓).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down N\'s position and checks for duplicate E while introducing T.\n\n<guess>tense</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 3: tense -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word, wrong position) – so N is in the word but not at position 4
- E: ✓ (correct position, so letter 5 is E)

Guess 2: ""noise""
- N: - (in the word, wrong position) – so N is not at position 1
- O: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct position, so letter 4 is S)
- E: ✓ (correct position, letter 5 is E)

So after guess 2, we know:
- The word ends with SE (positions 4 and 5 are S and E)
- N is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4. Since the word is _ _ _ S E, N must be in position 2 or 3.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, O, I.

Guess 3: ""tense""
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (so position 2 E is correct? But note: we placed E at position 2. The ✓ indicates that E is at position 2? But wait, we have two E's? And the feedback for position 2 E is ✓? That means E is at position 2? And also we have E at position 5 ✓? So the word has E at position 2 and 5? And E is at position 5? Wait, let's parse:
- T at position 1: x (T not in the word)
- E at position 2: ✓ (so E is in the word at position 2? And we know from previous that E is also at position 5? So at least two E's? But note, we have E at position 2 and 5? So the word has E at position 2 and 5?
- N at position 3: ✓ (so N is at position 3? Therefore, we found N at position 3? Which is consistent? Because we knew N was at 2 or 3? And now we get ✓ at position 3? So it's fixed? At position 3?
- S at position 4: ✓ (as expected? We knew S at 4? So no new information?)
- E at position 5: ✓ (as expected)

So feedback: T(x), E(✓), N(✓), S(✓), E(✓) – meaning:
- T is absent? So not in the word? We can add T to the absent letters?
- E at position 2 is correct? So the secret word has E at position 2? 
- N at position 3 is correct? So N at position 3?
- S at 4 and E at 5? As before?

Therefore, we now know:
- Secret word pattern: _ E N S E? Positions: 1: unknown, 2: E, 3: N, 4: S, 5: E? So the secret word is ? E N S E? 
- But note: are there two E's? Because position 2 and 5 are both E? And maybe others? But we don't know? Also, we have N at position 3? 
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, T (from guess 3)

Now, what letters can be at position 1? We need a 5-letter word of the form ? E N S E? That must be a valid English word? And without using C,R,A,O,I,T? And the letter at position 1 must be from the remaining alphabet? 

Possible words: 
The pattern is X E N S E? 

What English words fit? For example: 
- ""cense""? But C is excluded? 
- ""sense""? But we have ""sense"": S E N S E? Then it has two S's? And S at position 4? Also, S at position 1? But we haven't used S at position 1? And we know S is at position 4? But we don't know about another S? So ""sense"" might be possible? But we are missing: what are the letters? Position 1: S? 
But is S present twice? We don't know? But in guess 2: ""noise"" had S at position 4? And if ""sense"" were the secret word? Then in guess 2: ""noise"" would have shown S at position 4? Which was ✓? And S at position 1? But in guess 2, we didn't test position 1? So S at position 1 would not be tested? So it could be? Also, in guess 2, we had N at position 1? Which was not correct? But in guess 3, ""tense"" would be T E N S E? Which, if secret is ""sense"": then the feedback? Position 1: T (x? Because secret S? And T not in word? So yes? Then E: ✓? N: ✓? S: ✓? E: ✓? So matches? 

But does ""sense"" use only the available letters? S,E,N? And we haven't eliminated S? Also, excluded letters: C,R,A,O,I,T? So S is allowed? Because we haven't been told S is absent? Actually, we know S is at position 4? So it is present? But we can have another S? 

So ""sense"" is a valid word? But let's check: the pattern is S E N S E? Position 1: S? Position 2: E? Position 3: N? Position 4: S? Position 5: E? So it ends with SE? And has E,E? Etc? 

But are there other words? For example, ""dense"": D E N S E? D is not excluded? But in guess 3? We used T? But that was absent? Now, ""dense"" has D? We haven't used D? So then? 

Wait: in guess 3: we guessed ""tense""? And the feedback for T: x? So T is absent? But D is not excluded? So ""dense"" would be D E N S E? Then if we guess? But we need to think? 

Also, ""mense""? Not common? ""lense""? L E N S E? Which is a variant of lens? Or ""wense""? Not? ""pense""? Not? 

So common words: ""sense"", ""dense"", ""tense"" we already guess? So ""sense"" and ""dense""? 

But ""tense"" we just guessed? So it's not a candidate? Because we got T: x? And E,N,S,E as above? So the word is not ""tense""? 

So possible candidates: ""sense"" and ""dense""? 

But we don't know the first letter? It could be S? Or D? Or others? 

What about ""fense""? Not? ""gense""? Not? ""hense""? Not? ""kense""? Not? ""mense""? Not? ""yense""? Not? 

""Bense""? Not common? 

So likely, the word is ""sense"" or ""dense""? Or? 

But note: the secret word must have E at 2 and 5? N at 3? S at 4? So only position 1? 

In guess 1: ""crane"" had N at position 4? And we got N: -? Meaning N was in the word but wrong position? But in ""sense"": N is at position 3? So when we put N at position 4? It should be marked as ""-"" because it's in the word at position 3? So correct? And for ""dense""? Same? 

In guess 2: ""noise"" had N at position 1? Which was ""-""? And for ""sense"", N at position 1? But ""sense"" doesn't have N at position 1? So in guess 2: if secret was ""sense"", we placed N at position 1? But secret N is at 3? So it should show ""-""? Which it did? So consistent? 

Similarly, for ""dense""? 

Now, we need to choose the next guess? But we have to guess only one? And we have two possibilities? 

Also, we haven't used D? In any guess? So we don't know about D? 

Similarly, S? We haven't used S at position 1? 

So we can guess either? But we have only 3 guesses left? Since we are on guess 3? Next is guess 4? 

The game gives 6 tries? So let's guess ""sense"" to check? Or ""dense""? 

But we want to maximize information? Or just guess? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses both possibilities? But we have to guess the word? Since we have two candidates? We can pick one? 

But note: we haven't tested S at other positions? Or D? 

So let's guess ""sense""? 

But if we guess ""sense"", and if it's not? Then we get feedback? 

Similarly? 

Also, we know that from guess 3: we had E at position 2 ✓? And position 5 ✓? So the word has E at 2? And E at 5? So if we guess ""sense"", it has those? 

Similarly, ""dense"". 

Is there another word? Like ""mense""? Or ""pense""? Probably not? So we can guess one? 

Let's guess ""dense"" because we haven't tested D? So we can learn about D? 

But if we guess ""dense"", and if it's correct? Then we win? If not? We know it must be ""sense""? So we can guess ""sense"" next? 

Similarly, guessing ""sense"": if correct? Win? If not? Must be ""dense""?

So we can guess either? 

I'll choose ""dense"" to test? 

But wait: in the word ""sense"", if we guess? But we haven't used S at position 1? And we know S is at 4? So if we get S at position 1? Then we know about S? But if we guess ""sense"": 
- Position 1: S? If the word is ""sense"", then ✓? 
- If the word is ""dense"", then for S at position 1? We get x? Because ""dense"" has D at 1? Not S? 

But we don't know? 

Actually, we don't need to? Because we are going to guess? 

So more concretely: 

Possible secret words: ""sense"" and ""dense""? 

We can pick one? I'll go with ""dense"" because we haven't tested D? And D is a common letter? 

So guess: ""dense""? 

But wait: pattern: for ""dense"": D at 1, E at 2? Which we know E at 2 is correct? Then we have E at 2? N at 3? S at 4? E at 5? 

If we guess ""dense"": 
- If it is the secret? We get all ✓? 
- If it is not? Then we get: D: but if secret is ""sense"", then D is not in the word? So x? Then positions: E:✓? N:✓? S:✓? E:✓? So D: x? Then we know it must be ""sense""? 

Similarly, if we guess ""sense"": 
- S at position 1: if secret is ""sense""? Then S: ✓? Etc? 
- If secret is ""dense"", then S at position 1: since secret has D at 1? And S at 4? So S is in the word? But not at position 1? So we get ""-"" for S? Then E:✓? N:✓? S: which is at 4? But we are placing S at position 1 and position 4? So when we place S at position 1? If secret is ""dense"", we have S at position 4? So in the word? But not at 1? So we get ""S(-)"" for position 1? And for position 4: S? But we have S at both? So position 4: ✓? Because same as before? 

Therefore, guessing ""sense"" would tell us: 
- If S: ✓? Then it must be ""sense""? 
- If S: -? Then it must be ""dense""? 

Similarly? Either way works? 

I think both are fine? But ""dense"" might be more informative? Because D is a new letter? So it tests for D? 

But since we are at guess 4? And we have two candidates? We can guess one? 

Let me choose ""dense""? 

So next guess: ""dense""?

Based on the feedback from all guesses:

### Summary of Known Information:
1. **Secret Word Pattern**: From Guess 2 and Guess 3:
   - Position 2: E (✓ confirmed in Guess 3).
   - Position 3: N (✓ confirmed in Guess 3).
   - Position 4: S (✓ confirmed in Guess 2).
   - Position 5: E (✓ confirmed in Guess 1).
   - Pattern: `_ E N S E`
   - The word must end with ""ENSE"", with E and N fixed in positions 2–5.

2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, O, I, T (all marked ❌ in feedback). Cannot use these letters.

3. **Present and Position-Known Letters**: E (positions 2 and 5), N (position 3), S (position 4). All are confirmed.

### Deductions:
- **Position 1**: Must be a letter not in the excluded list (C, R, A, O, I, T). Based on common English words, valid options include:
  - ""dense"" (D at position 1)
  - ""sense"" (S at position 1, which would imply a second S)
  - Other rare words like ""mense"" or ""pense"" are uncommon and less likely.
- Since ""tense"" was guessed and T was absent, and no other common letters have been tested for position 1, the top candidates are ""dense"" and ""sense"".
- **Strategy**: Guess ""dense"" to test the letter D (a new untested common consonant). If D is absent (❌), the word must be ""sense"". If all are ✓, it solves the word.

### Guess Selection:
- ""dense"" fits the pattern `_ E N S E` and uses D (a new letter). It strictly adheres to the feedback:
  - Position 1: D (tests if present/absent and at correct position).
  - Positions 2–5 already match known letters (E, N, S, E).

This guess will resolve the remaining uncertainty efficiently.

<guess>dense</guess>",dense,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word, wrong position) – so N is in the word but not at position 4
- E: ✓ (correct position, so letter 5 is E)

Guess 2: ""noise""
- N: - (in the word, wrong position) – so N is not at position 1
- O: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct position, so letter 4 is S)
- E: ✓ (correct position, letter 5 is E)

So after guess 2, we know:
- The word ends with SE (positions 4 and 5 are S and E)
- N is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4. Since the word is _ _ _ S E, N must be in position 2 or 3.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, O, I.

Guess 3: ""tense""
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (so position 2 E is correct? But note: we placed E at position 2. The ✓ indicates that E is at position 2? But wait, we have two E's? And the feedback for position 2 E is ✓? That means E is at position 2? And also we have E at position 5 ✓? So the word has E at position 2 and 5? And E is at position 5? Wait, let's parse:
- T at position 1: x (T not in the word)
- E at position 2: ✓ (so E is in the word at position 2? And we know from previous that E is also at position 5? So at least two E's? But note, we have E at position 2 and 5? So the word has E at position 2 and 5?
- N at position 3: ✓ (so N is at position 3? Therefore, we found N at position 3? Which is consistent? Because we knew N was at 2 or 3? And now we get ✓ at position 3? So it's fixed? At position 3?
- S at position 4: ✓ (as expected? We knew S at 4? So no new information?)
- E at position 5: ✓ (as expected)

So feedback: T(x), E(✓), N(✓), S(✓), E(✓) – meaning:
- T is absent? So not in the word? We can add T to the absent letters?
- E at position 2 is correct? So the secret word has E at position 2? 
- N at position 3 is correct? So N at position 3?
- S at 4 and E at 5? As before?

Therefore, we now know:
- Secret word pattern: _ E N S E? Positions: 1: unknown, 2: E, 3: N, 4: S, 5: E? So the secret word is ? E N S E? 
- But note: are there two E's? Because position 2 and 5 are both E? And maybe others? But we don't know? Also, we have N at position 3? 
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, T (from guess 3)

Now, what letters can be at position 1? We need a 5-letter word of the form ? E N S E? That must be a valid English word? And without using C,R,A,O,I,T? And the letter at position 1 must be from the remaining alphabet? 

Possible words: 
The pattern is X E N S E? 

What English words fit? For example: 
- ""cense""? But C is excluded? 
- ""sense""? But we have ""sense"": S E N S E? Then it has two S's? And S at position 4? Also, S at position 1? But we haven't used S at position 1? And we know S is at position 4? But we don't know about another S? So ""sense"" might be possible? But we are missing: what are the letters? Position 1: S? 
But is S present twice? We don't know? But in guess 2: ""noise"" had S at position 4? And if ""sense"" were the secret word? Then in guess 2: ""noise"" would have shown S at position 4? Which was ✓? And S at position 1? But in guess 2, we didn't test position 1? So S at position 1 would not be tested? So it could be? Also, in guess 2, we had N at position 1? Which was not correct? But in guess 3, ""tense"" would be T E N S E? Which, if secret is ""sense"": then the feedback? Position 1: T (x? Because secret S? And T not in word? So yes? Then E: ✓? N: ✓? S: ✓? E: ✓? So matches? 

But does ""sense"" use only the available letters? S,E,N? And we haven't eliminated S? Also, excluded letters: C,R,A,O,I,T? So S is allowed? Because we haven't been told S is absent? Actually, we know S is at position 4? So it is present? But we can have another S? 

So ""sense"" is a valid word? But let's check: the pattern is S E N S E? Position 1: S? Position 2: E? Position 3: N? Position 4: S? Position 5: E? So it ends with SE? And has E,E? Etc? 

But are there other words? For example, ""dense"": D E N S E? D is not excluded? But in guess 3? We used T? But that was absent? Now, ""dense"" has D? We haven't used D? So then? 

Wait: in guess 3: we guessed ""tense""? And the feedback for T: x? So T is absent? But D is not excluded? So ""dense"" would be D E N S E? Then if we guess? But we need to think? 

Also, ""mense""? Not common? ""lense""? L E N S E? Which is a variant of lens? Or ""wense""? Not? ""pense""? Not? 

So common words: ""sense"", ""dense"", ""tense"" we already guess? So ""sense"" and ""dense""? 

But ""tense"" we just guessed? So it's not a candidate? Because we got T: x? And E,N,S,E as above? So the word is not ""tense""? 

So possible candidates: ""sense"" and ""dense""? 

But we don't know the first letter? It could be S? Or D? Or others? 

What about ""fense""? Not? ""gense""? Not? ""hense""? Not? ""kense""? Not? ""mense""? Not? ""yense""? Not? 

""Bense""? Not common? 

So likely, the word is ""sense"" or ""dense""? Or? 

But note: the secret word must have E at 2 and 5? N at 3? S at 4? So only position 1? 

In guess 1: ""crane"" had N at position 4? And we got N: -? Meaning N was in the word but wrong position? But in ""sense"": N is at position 3? So when we put N at position 4? It should be marked as ""-"" because it's in the word at position 3? So correct? And for ""dense""? Same? 

In guess 2: ""noise"" had N at position 1? Which was ""-""? And for ""sense"", N at position 1? But ""sense"" doesn't have N at position 1? So in guess 2: if secret was ""sense"", we placed N at position 1? But secret N is at 3? So it should show ""-""? Which it did? So consistent? 

Similarly, for ""dense""? 

Now, we need to choose the next guess? But we have to guess only one? And we have two possibilities? 

Also, we haven't used D? In any guess? So we don't know about D? 

Similarly, S? We haven't used S at position 1? 

So we can guess either? But we have only 3 guesses left? Since we are on guess 3? Next is guess 4? 

The game gives 6 tries? So let's guess ""sense"" to check? Or ""dense""? 

But we want to maximize information? Or just guess? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses both possibilities? But we have to guess the word? Since we have two candidates? We can pick one? 

But note: we haven't tested S at other positions? Or D? 

So let's guess ""sense""? 

But if we guess ""sense"", and if it's not? Then we get feedback? 

Similarly? 

Also, we know that from guess 3: we had E at position 2 ✓? And position 5 ✓? So the word has E at 2? And E at 5? So if we guess ""sense"", it has those? 

Similarly, ""dense"". 

Is there another word? Like ""mense""? Or ""pense""? Probably not? So we can guess one? 

Let's guess ""dense"" because we haven't tested D? So we can learn about D? 

But if we guess ""dense"", and if it's correct? Then we win? If not? We know it must be ""sense""? So we can guess ""sense"" next? 

Similarly, guessing ""sense"": if correct? Win? If not? Must be ""dense""?

So we can guess either? 

I'll choose ""dense"" to test? 

But wait: in the word ""sense"", if we guess? But we haven't used S at position 1? And we know S is at 4? So if we get S at position 1? Then we know about S? But if we guess ""sense"": 
- Position 1: S? If the word is ""sense"", then ✓? 
- If the word is ""dense"", then for S at position 1? We get x? Because ""dense"" has D at 1? Not S? 

But we don't know? 

Actually, we don't need to? Because we are going to guess? 

So more concretely: 

Possible secret words: ""sense"" and ""dense""? 

We can pick one? I'll go with ""dense"" because we haven't tested D? And D is a common letter? 

So guess: ""dense""? 

But wait: pattern: for ""dense"": D at 1, E at 2? Which we know E at 2 is correct? Then we have E at 2? N at 3? S at 4? E at 5? 

If we guess ""dense"": 
- If it is the secret? We get all ✓? 
- If it is not? Then we get: D: but if secret is ""sense"", then D is not in the word? So x? Then positions: E:✓? N:✓? S:✓? E:✓? So D: x? Then we know it must be ""sense""? 

Similarly, if we guess ""sense"": 
- S at position 1: if secret is ""sense""? Then S: ✓? Etc? 
- If secret is ""dense"", then S at position 1: since secret has D at 1? And S at 4? So S is in the word? But not at position 1? So we get ""-"" for S? Then E:✓? N:✓? S: which is at 4? But we are placing S at position 1 and position 4? So when we place S at position 1? If secret is ""dense"", we have S at position 4? So in the word? But not at 1? So we get ""S(-)"" for position 1? And for position 4: S? But we have S at both? So position 4: ✓? Because same as before? 

Therefore, guessing ""sense"" would tell us: 
- If S: ✓? Then it must be ""sense""? 
- If S: -? Then it must be ""dense""? 

Similarly? Either way works? 

I think both are fine? But ""dense"" might be more informative? Because D is a new letter? So it tests for D? 

But since we are at guess 4? And we have two candidates? We can guess one? 

Let me choose ""dense""? 

So next guess: ""dense""?Based on the feedback from all guesses:

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,sense,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and covers some of the most common letters in English (C, R, A, N, E).

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: x (not in the word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: ✓ (in the word and correct position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The letter E is in the word and it is in the position 5 (since we used the 5th letter as E and it's correct). So the 5th letter of the secret word is E.
2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position. It must be in one of the first four positions? But note: our word was ""crane"", which is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. So N is in the word but not at position 4. Since position 5 is taken by E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all. So we must avoid using C, R, A in the next guess.

Also, note that the word does not contain C, R, or A.

We know the 5th letter is E. So the word ends with E.

Our next guess should:
- Contain the letter N (since it's present, and we know it must be in positions 1, 2, or 3). But note: in our next guess, we should try to place N in different positions to test where it might be.
- Exclude the letters C, R, A.
- Include other common letters to get more information.

Moreover, we must keep in mind that E is fixed in position 5. So we can use E in position 5 again, but that's the same. We don't need to change that.

What are some words that end with E and contain N? And without C, R, A.

Also, we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present: C, R, A.

Let's think of words that fit:
- They have 5 letters, ending with E.
- Contain N (but not in the same position as before? We don't know the position of N yet, but we know it's not at position 4? Actually, the feedback was for N: it exists but not in position 4. But it could be in position 1,2,3? But note, the word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. Since position 5 is E, N must be in 1,2,3 or ... wait, position 4 is the only one we know it's not? Actually, we don't know: it could be in position 4? Wait, no: our previous word had N in position 4, and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, N cannot be in position 4 of the secret word? Or could it? Wait: the feedback says it is in the word but not in the correct position? Yes. So N is in the word, but not at position 4. That implies that N must be at positions 1,2,3, or ... 5? But position 5 is E, so it's fixed and cannot be N? Wait: we have E at position 5 as correct. So the secret word ends with E. Therefore, N cannot be at position 5. Then N must be in positions 1,2, or 3.

So, to recap:
- Secret word: _ _ _ _ E
- Contains the letter N in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.
- Does not contain C, R, A.

We have three positions to test for N.

But we also want to cover other common letters to get more information.

Common letters: S, T, L, O, etc.

We should try a word that has N in a different position (say position 1 or 2) and also introduces new common letters.

Possible words ending with E? And containing N, but without C, R, A.

Let me list some:
- STONE: S,T,O,N,E -> note: N is at position 4? But we must avoid position 4 for N because we know N is not at position 4? Actually, we don't know the secret word's N position. But if we use ""stone"", we have N at position 4 again? We want to avoid putting N in the same position? No, we can put N in a different position? But currently we know it's not at position 4? Actually, we can try putting N at position 1 or 2 to check? But in ""stone"", N is at position 4. So that might not help? Actually, we can use it: because if we put N in position 4 and if it gets marked as ""x"", that would be inconsistent? But since we already know N is not at position 4? We know that from the previous feedback? Actually, the previous feedback only says that in the word ""crane"", N was present but not in position 4. It doesn't say that the secret word cannot have N at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:

The feedback ""-"" for N in ""crane"" (which was at position 4) means that the secret word does contain the letter N, but not at position 4. Therefore, for the secret word, N must be at a different position (1,2,3, or maybe position 5? But position 5 is E). So we must look for positions 1,2,3.

Therefore, in our next guess, we should put N in one of positions 1,2,3 to test? Or we can put it in a position we haven't tested? We haven't tested positions 1,2,3? Actually, we only tried position 4. So we can test in position 1 or 2 or 3? But we don't have to test all at once? We can choose one.

We should try to choose a word that has N in position 1? And then also introduce other letters.

Also, we know E is at the end. So the word ends with E.

Idea: we can use ""ONSET"" but ONSET has O,N,S,E,T. But O and T are new? And N is at position 2? And ends with E? But ""onset"" is five letters: O-N-S-E-T? But that doesn't end with E? It ends with T? So not ending with E? Wait, ONSET is O-N-S-E-T -> positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. We need the word to end with E? So position 5 must be E? So we require the word to end with E.

Wait, the word must be: ???E.

So we need words that end with E? And containing N? Without C,R,A.

Options:
- Consider ""LINE"": too short? It must be 5 letters. So: ""LINED""? Wait, but we need exactly 5 letters? No, we are guessing 5 letters? So we need a word that is exactly 5 letters and ends with E.

Examples: phone, stone, alone, shine, etc.

But ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. This has N at position 4? And ends with E? But N at position 4: we already know N is not at position 4? So if we guess ""stone"", then if the feedback for N is ""-"" again? Then we know N is not at 4 again? Wait, we already know N is not at 4? And let's see: we are going to put N at 4? Then the feedback for N might be:

If N is in the word and we put it at position 4, but the secret word doesn't have N at 4 (we already know that), then it should be ""-"" again? So it doesn't tell us anything new? So maybe we should avoid putting N at position 4? Therefore, we should put N in a position we haven't tried: position 1,2, or 3.

So let's think of words that:
- Have N in position 1 or 2 or 3?
- And end with E.
- Without C,R,A.

Let me try to find a word that ends with E? Also has N in position 1: 
Example: ""noise""? N-O-I-S-E? Wait, ends with E? Yes: N is at position 1? But note that ""noise"" has O and I and S? Also, note we can try ""niche""? N-I-C-H-E? Wait, but we cannot use C? Because C is excluded from the first guess feedback? We have C: x -> it's not in the word. So we cannot use C? So ""niche"" is invalid? Because it has C? Cannot use C,R,A.

So ""noise"" is N,O,I,S,E -> doesn't have C,R,A? And ends with E? And N at position 1? Okay.

Another option: ""niece""? N,I,E,C,E? Again, C is not allowed? So invalid? We cannot use C? So must avoid?

""noise"": N-O-I-S-E? No C,R,A? So okay.

But what about ""tinge""? T-I-N-G-E? Ends with E? And N is at position 3? That could be? So N is at position 3? And has T,I,G? Then we can test?

But note: we also may need to avoid duplicate letters? We don't know if the word has duplicate? So we can still use duplicate if we don't know? But for maximizing information, distinct letters might be better? But let's check the word ""stone""? That has position 4? But if we avoid putting N at 4? Then we might avoid ""stone"".

Let me consider ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? Then we are using N at the 3rd position?

We can think of:

- Option 1: Put N at position 1? -> e.g., ""noise"": N,O,I,S,E.
- Option 2: Put N at position 2? -> e.g., ""inkle""? Wait, is ""inkle"" a word? It is not common? Or ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? But note: ""unite"" ends with E? And N at position 2? And letters: U,N,I,T,E -> no C,R,A? Okay? But U is not that common? Or ""stage""? But stage has A? Avoid A? So invalid? ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E? But N is at position 4? Which we want to avoid? So no? ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E? N at position 4? Avoid? Similarly, ""phone"": P-H-O-N-E? N at 4? Avoid.

What about ""knife"": K-N-I-F-E? Yes? That would have N at position 2? And ends with E? And letters K,N,I,F,E? No C,R,A? Okay? And we can use that? Or ""snide"": S-N-I-D-E? Ends with E? N at position 2? S,N,I,D,E? No C,R,A? Okay.

Or ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W? Ends with W? Not E? So not.

Another idea: ""owine""? Not a word? 

Valid words: ""tinge"" (N at 3), ""noise"" (N at 1), ""knife"" (N at 2), ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Invalid? ""unite"" we considered.

Let me pick ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? 

Then the feedback might tell us about N: if we put N at position 3 and if the secret word has N at position 3, it would be ✓? Otherwise, if N is elsewhere, it would be ""-""? Or if not? But we know N is not at position 4? And we are testing position 3? So if we get a ""-"" for N, then N is not at position 3? But if we get a ✓? Then we know.

Alternatively, I think ""knife"" or ""noise"" are options? Also, common.

But note: we also have E in position 5? And we are repeating E? But that's okay.

I think ""noise"" is good: 
- First letter N: if N is at position 1, then ✓? Else if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know N is in the word? So if we get ""x"" for N? Then it can't be? Because N is present? Actually, if we put N at position 1 and the secret word has N at position 1? Then ✓? If the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get ""-""? Similarly, if at position 3? Then we get ""-""? Because position is wrong? So it doesn't tell us exactly? But we will get information about the position? But note: we are introducing O, I, S? Which are common.

Similarly, with ""tinge"": letters T,I,N,G,E? We are introducing T,I,G.

But note: we don't know if T,I,G are in the word? But that's the purpose? To test new letters.

Also, consider that E is already known? So we can ignore its feedback? Actually, we know E is at position 5? So we don't expect any feedback other than ✓? So we can focus on other positions? Actually, feedback for E should always be ✓? Because it's correct? So no new information? We can save a letter? But we must use E at the end? Actually, we have to? Because we know? So in the next guess, we must put E at the end? Therefore, we will get E: ✓? So we shouldn't waste a letter? But we are trying to test other letters? That's okay? So we are using the E? And then we have to guess?

So I propose ""noise""? Let me go with ""noise""? Or is there a better word?

We want maximum letter coverage? Common letters: S, T, L, N, O? We already know N is present? So we can include S and O? Also, T? How about ""stonk""? Not a word? Or ""stone""? But we avoid stone because it has N at 4? Which we already know is wrong? And the same as the previous guess? Actually, we can use ""stone"" but then we are putting N in position 4? Which we know is not correct? So it would be wasteful? Because if N is not at 4? Then we get ""-""? That's the same feedback? Doesn't help? So we avoid.

Therefore, let me pick ""noise""? 

But ""noise"": 
  N: let's see? Position 1? We don't know? 
  O: position 2?
  I: position 3?
  S: position 4?
  E: position 5: ✓ (we know)

Also, note: we have just used S and O? They are new? They haven't been tested? We don't know about S and O.

So let's do it.

So my next guess: ""noise""

But wait: feedback from first guess: we also know N is present? So we must use N? But if we don't use N? Then we might not get information? Actually, we have to guess words? And we know N is present? So yes, we should include N? So noise includes N? Correct? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""noise"" is good?

Any other options? Like ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? Which has T? As common letter? And U? Less common? Or ""knife""? K-N-I-F-E? F and K? Less common? So ""noise"" is better? Because O,I,S are more common.

So I choose ""noise"".

Therefore, the next guess: ""noise""

But wait: is ""noise"" a valid word? Yes, common.

So response: <guess>noise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is confirmed to be in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.
- N is present in the secret word but not in position 4 (-). Since position 5 is E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- C, R, and A are absent (x) and should be avoided.

For the second guess, we need to:
- Keep E in position 5.
- Include N but not in position 4 (to avoid redundant feedback). I've chosen to place N in position 1 to test a new location.
- Introduce new common vowels and consonants to maximize information, avoiding C, R, A.
- Select a valid English word ending with E.

The word ""noise"" fits these criteria:
- Position 1: N (tests N in position 1).
- Position 2: O (new vowel).
- Position 3: I (new vowel).
- Position 4: S (new consonant).
- Position 5: E (confirmed correct).

This guess may provide useful feedback on N's position (if N is in position 1, it will be ✓; otherwise, -) and reveal whether O, I, or S are present.

<guess>noise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

Guess 2: ""noise""
- N: - (in the word but wrong position) — so N is not at position 1 (since we placed it there in this guess)
- O: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct position) — so S is in the word and at position 4
- E: ✓ (correct position) — we already knew E is at position 5

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word ends with E (position 5) and has S at position 4. So the word pattern is: _ _ _ S E

2. N is in the word but not in position 4 (from guess 1) and not in position 1 (from guess 2). Since the word is _ _ _ S E, the positions for N are 2 or 3 (because position 4 is S and 5 is E).

3. The following letters are not in the word: C, R, A, O, I.

4. We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, I, S. We know E and S are in the word (with fixed positions) and N is in the word (but position unknown, either 2 or 3). The absent letters are C, R, A, O, I.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
- Keep S in position 4 and E in position 5: so the last two letters must be S and E.
- Include N in either position 2 or 3 to test its location (since it must be in one of these two positions).
- Avoid using C, R, A, O, I.
- Use new common letters to get more information.

Given the pattern: _ _ _ S E

We need to fill the first three positions. We know N must be in position 2 or 3. So we can try to put N in position 2 and see what happens? Or in position 3? We can choose one.

Also, we need to choose letters for the remaining positions that are common and not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, O, I.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover more common letters.

Possible words:

Option 1: Put N in position 2: then the word is _ N _ S E

What can the first letter be? And the third?

For example:
- ""unuse""? But U is not excluded? But ""unuse"" is not a common word? And it has U? Also, we have to avoid O and I? But U is allowed? But ""unuse"" might not be valid? Let's think of valid words.

Better: ""tense"": T E N S E? But E is repeated? And we have E at position 5? But we are putting E at position 2? Wait, no: ""tense"" is T-E-N-S-E. So position 1: T, 2: E, 3: N, 4: S, 5: E. But we know position 5 is E? And position 4 is S? So that matches? But we are putting E at position 2? That might be okay? But we don't know if E is at position 2? Also, we have two E's? But the secret word might have two E's? We don't know? But from previous feedback, we only know about one E? But it could have more? So it's possible? But we are using E at position 2? That might be a good test? Because if E is at position 2? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know E is at position 5? So if we put E at position 2 and it's not in the word elsewhere? Then we get ""x""? But we know E is at 5? So if we get a ""-"" for E at position 2? That would mean there is another E? But if we get ""x""? Then no other E? So it gives information? But we are using a letter that we know is in the word? But we are testing for duplicate? That might be okay? But we are also testing N at position 3? Because in ""tense"", N is at position 3? And we know N must be at 2 or 3? So if we put N at 3? Then if it's correct? We get ✓? Otherwise, if N is at 2? Then we get ""-""? Because it's in the word but wrong position? So that would tell us? Also, we are introducing T? Which is common.

But ""tense"" has two E's? And we are using E at position 2? Which might not be necessary? But it's a valid word.

Another option: ""dense"": D-E-N-S-E? Same issue? E at position 2.

To avoid using E again? We can try a word without E in the first positions? But we have to have S and E at the end? So the word must end with SE? So the third letter can be anything? But we are putting N at 2 or 3.

What if we put N at position 3? Then the word is _ _ N S E

For example: ""bunse""? Not a word? ""punse""? Not? ""minse""? Not common? ""winse""? Not? ""linse""? Not? ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Excluded? ""dunse""? Not? ""gunse""? Not? ""hunse""? Not? ""sunse""? Not? ""tunse""? Not? ""vinse""? Not? ""winse""? Not? ""yense""? Not? 

Actually, common words: ""tense"", ""dense"", ""sense"" (but ""sense"" is S-E-N-S-E? Then position 1: S? But we are going to put S at position 4? And we know S is at position 4? So if we put S at position 1? Then we are testing if S is at position 1? But we know S is at position 4? So if there is another S? Then we might get ""-"" for S at position 1? Or if not? Then ""x""? But we don't know? So it might be okay? But ""sense"" has S at 1 and 4? And E at 2? And N at 3? So ""sense"": S(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5). But we know position 4 is S? And position 5 is E? So that matches? But we are using S at position 1? And E at position 2? So we are testing for duplicate S and E? But we don't know if they are duplicated? So it might be a good test? But we are using N at position 3? Which is one of the possibilities.

But we have to avoid O and I? ""sense"" doesn't have O or I? So okay? But we are using S and E again? Which we know are in the word? But we are testing their positions? So it might be acceptable? But we are not introducing many new letters? Only S and E? But we are testing for duplicates? And N at 3.

But we need to introduce new letters? Because we have only tested a few? So maybe better to use a word with new letters? For example, ""tense"" introduces T? Which is new? And E? But we are testing E at position 2? So it's new information? Similarly, ""dense"" introduces D? Etc.

But let's list possible words that end with ""se"" and have N in position 2 or 3? And without C,R,A,O,I.

For position 2 (N at 2): pattern _ N _ S E

Possible words:
- tense: T E N S E -> T is new? E is known? But we are testing E at position 2? Also, N at 3? Wait, no: in ""tense"", N is at position 3? And the pattern is _ N _ S E? If we want N at position 2? Then it should be _ N _ S E? So for ""tense"", it is T at 1, E at 2, N at 3? So that's not N at 2? It's N at 3? So for N at position 2? We need a word like: ? N ? S E

For example: ""unsee""? U N S E E? But that's U at 1, N at 2, S at 3, E at 4, E at 5? But we know position 4 must be S? And position 5 E? So in ""unsee"", position 4 is E? Not S? So invalid? Because we must have S at position 4? So the word must have S at position 4? So the pattern is fixed: positions 4 and 5 are S and E? So the first three are free? But we are putting N at 2 or 3.

So for N at position 2: the word is [letter1] N [letter3] S E

What are valid words? For example:
- ""unset"": U N S E T? But that ends with T? Not E? So position 5 is T? But we need position 5 to be E? So not? ""unsew""? U N S E W? Ends with W? Not E? ""unsay""? But has A? Excluded? And ends with Y? Not E? ""unseam""? Too long? ""unseal""? Too long? ""unseam"" is 6? So not 5? 

Actually, I can't think of a common word with pattern ? N ? S E? Because the ? at position 3 must be a letter that with S and E? But the word must be a valid English word? Like ""anise""? But ""anise"" has A? Excluded? ""unite"" is not? ""knife"" is not? 

Perhaps ""insee""? Not a word? ""ensew""? Not? 

So maybe there are no common words with N at position 2 and ending with SE? So we must put N at position 3? Then pattern: _ _ N S E

Then we have words like:
- tense: T E N S E -> T at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? But E at 2? And we are using E again? But it's okay? Because we are testing if E is at position 2? Also, we are putting N at 3? Which is one of the possibilities? So if N is at 3? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if N is at 2? Then we get ""-"" for N? Because it's in the word but wrong position? So that tells us N is at 2? So it's good? And we introduce T? Which is new? So ""tense"" seems good? 

Other options: ""dense"": D E N S E? Similarly? D at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Introduces D? 

""sense"": S E N S E? S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Introduces S at 1? But we know S is at 4? So if we get a ✓ for S at 1? Then there is another S? If we get ""-""? Then S is at 4 only? But we are using S at 1? And we know S is at 4? So if we get ""x"" for S at 1? That would mean no other S? But if we get ""-""? Then there is another S? So it gives information? But we are using a slot? 

But we have to choose? Also, ""mense""? Not common? ""pense""? Not? ""lense""? L E N S E? Which is a word? Lens with e? But sometimes accepted? 

""tense"" is a common word? So I think ""tense"" is a good choice? 

But we are using E at position 2? Which might be redundant? But it tests for duplicate E? And we don't know if there is another E? So it's new information? 

Alternatively, we can avoid using E? But then we might not have many options? For example, ""bunse"" is not a word? ""gunse"" not? ""minse"" not? ""winse"" not? ""lynse"" not? ""punse"" not? 

So I think ""tense"" is acceptable? 

But let's see if there is a word without E in the first positions? For example, ""towns""? But ends with S? Not SE? ""downs""? Not? 

Another idea: ""minus""? But ends with S? Not E? ""finis""? Ends with S? Not E? 

So I think we have to use a word that has E at the end? And we are stuck with the pattern? So ""tense"" or ""dense"" or ""sense"" are the options? 

Among these, ""tense"" introduces T? Which is common? And we haven't used T? So better than ""sense"" which introduces S again? But ""sense"" has S at 1? Which is new? But we are testing S? 

But I think ""tense"" is better? Because T is a new letter? 

So I choose ""tense"". 

Therefore, the next guess: ""tense""

But let's double-check the pattern: we are putting N at position 3? And we know N must be at 2 or 3? So if we get feedback for N: 
- If N is at position 3? Then ✓? 
- If N is at position 2? Then we get ""-"" for N? Because it's in the word but not at 3? 

Also, for E at position 2: 
- If E is at position 2? Then ✓? 
- If not? Then if there is another E? We get ""-""? Or if not? We get ""x""? 

And T at position 1: 
- If T is in the word? And at position 1? Then ✓? 
- If T is in the word but not at 1? Then ""-""? 
- If T is not in the word? Then ""x""? 

So we get information about T and E? And N? 

Also, we avoid C,R,A,O,I? 

So it seems good? 

Therefore, I go with ""tense"". 

<guess>tense</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)**  
  - E is in the correct position (position 5).  
  - N is in the word but not in position 4.  
  - C, R, A are absent.

- **Guess 2: ""noise"" → Feedback: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)**  
  - S is in the correct position (position 4).  
  - E is still in the correct position (position 5).  
  - N is in the word but not in position 1.  
  - O and I are absent.

### Key Deductions:
1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ _ S E` (S in position 4, E in position 5).
2. N is present but not in positions 1 or 4. Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, N must be in position 2 or 3.
3. Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I (cannot be used).
4. Present letters: N, S, E (with S and E fixed in positions 4 and 5).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- Test N in position 3 (since position 1 was already tested and ruled out, and position 4 is fixed as S). If N is in position 3, it will show ✓; if not, it will show - (indicating N is in position 2).
- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, D, L) to maximize information, avoiding absent letters.
- Use a valid 5-letter word ending in ""SE"" (to match the fixed S and E).

The word **""tense""** fits perfectly:
- **T**: New common consonant (tests position 1).
- **E**: In position 2 (tests for duplicate E; if E is here, it shows ✓; if not, it may show - or x).
- **N**: In position 3 (tests if N is here or in position 2).
- **S**: Fixed in position 4 (will show ✓).
- **E**: Fixed in position 5 (will show ✓).

This guess efficiently narrows down N's position and checks for duplicate E while introducing T.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)
Guess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)
Guess 3: tense -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: - (in the word, wrong position) – so N is in the word but not at position 4
- E: ✓ (correct position, so letter 5 is E)

Guess 2: ""noise""
- N: - (in the word, wrong position) – so N is not at position 1
- O: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- S: ✓ (correct position, so letter 4 is S)
- E: ✓ (correct position, letter 5 is E)

So after guess 2, we know:
- The word ends with SE (positions 4 and 5 are S and E)
- N is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4. Since the word is _ _ _ S E, N must be in position 2 or 3.
- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, O, I.

Guess 3: ""tense""
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (so position 2 E is correct? But note: we placed E at position 2. The ✓ indicates that E is at position 2? But wait, we have two E's? And the feedback for position 2 E is ✓? That means E is at position 2? And also we have E at position 5 ✓? So the word has E at position 2 and 5? And E is at position 5? Wait, let's parse:
- T at position 1: x (T not in the word)
- E at position 2: ✓ (so E is in the word at position 2? And we know from previous that E is also at position 5? So at least two E's? But note, we have E at position 2 and 5? So the word has E at position 2 and 5?
- N at position 3: ✓ (so N is at position 3? Therefore, we found N at position 3? Which is consistent? Because we knew N was at 2 or 3? And now we get ✓ at position 3? So it's fixed? At position 3?
- S at position 4: ✓ (as expected? We knew S at 4? So no new information?)
- E at position 5: ✓ (as expected)

So feedback: T(x), E(✓), N(✓), S(✓), E(✓) – meaning:
- T is absent? So not in the word? We can add T to the absent letters?
- E at position 2 is correct? So the secret word has E at position 2? 
- N at position 3 is correct? So N at position 3?
- S at 4 and E at 5? As before?

Therefore, we now know:
- Secret word pattern: _ E N S E? Positions: 1: unknown, 2: E, 3: N, 4: S, 5: E? So the secret word is ? E N S E? 
- But note: are there two E's? Because position 2 and 5 are both E? And maybe others? But we don't know? Also, we have N at position 3? 
- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, T (from guess 3)

Now, what letters can be at position 1? We need a 5-letter word of the form ? E N S E? That must be a valid English word? And without using C,R,A,O,I,T? And the letter at position 1 must be from the remaining alphabet? 

Possible words: 
The pattern is X E N S E? 

What English words fit? For example: 
- ""cense""? But C is excluded? 
- ""sense""? But we have ""sense"": S E N S E? Then it has two S's? And S at position 4? Also, S at position 1? But we haven't used S at position 1? And we know S is at position 4? But we don't know about another S? So ""sense"" might be possible? But we are missing: what are the letters? Position 1: S? 
But is S present twice? We don't know? But in guess 2: ""noise"" had S at position 4? And if ""sense"" were the secret word? Then in guess 2: ""noise"" would have shown S at position 4? Which was ✓? And S at position 1? But in guess 2, we didn't test position 1? So S at position 1 would not be tested? So it could be? Also, in guess 2, we had N at position 1? Which was not correct? But in guess 3, ""tense"" would be T E N S E? Which, if secret is ""sense"": then the feedback? Position 1: T (x? Because secret S? And T not in word? So yes? Then E: ✓? N: ✓? S: ✓? E: ✓? So matches? 

But does ""sense"" use only the available letters? S,E,N? And we haven't eliminated S? Also, excluded letters: C,R,A,O,I,T? So S is allowed? Because we haven't been told S is absent? Actually, we know S is at position 4? So it is present? But we can have another S? 

So ""sense"" is a valid word? But let's check: the pattern is S E N S E? Position 1: S? Position 2: E? Position 3: N? Position 4: S? Position 5: E? So it ends with SE? And has E,E? Etc? 

But are there other words? For example, ""dense"": D E N S E? D is not excluded? But in guess 3? We used T? But that was absent? Now, ""dense"" has D? We haven't used D? So then? 

Wait: in guess 3: we guessed ""tense""? And the feedback for T: x? So T is absent? But D is not excluded? So ""dense"" would be D E N S E? Then if we guess? But we need to think? 

Also, ""mense""? Not common? ""lense""? L E N S E? Which is a variant of lens? Or ""wense""? Not? ""pense""? Not? 

So common words: ""sense"", ""dense"", ""tense"" we already guess? So ""sense"" and ""dense""? 

But ""tense"" we just guessed? So it's not a candidate? Because we got T: x? And E,N,S,E as above? So the word is not ""tense""? 

So possible candidates: ""sense"" and ""dense""? 

But we don't know the first letter? It could be S? Or D? Or others? 

What about ""fense""? Not? ""gense""? Not? ""hense""? Not? ""kense""? Not? ""mense""? Not? ""yense""? Not? 

""Bense""? Not common? 

So likely, the word is ""sense"" or ""dense""? Or? 

But note: the secret word must have E at 2 and 5? N at 3? S at 4? So only position 1? 

In guess 1: ""crane"" had N at position 4? And we got N: -? Meaning N was in the word but wrong position? But in ""sense"": N is at position 3? So when we put N at position 4? It should be marked as ""-"" because it's in the word at position 3? So correct? And for ""dense""? Same? 

In guess 2: ""noise"" had N at position 1? Which was ""-""? And for ""sense"", N at position 1? But ""sense"" doesn't have N at position 1? So in guess 2: if secret was ""sense"", we placed N at position 1? But secret N is at 3? So it should show ""-""? Which it did? So consistent? 

Similarly, for ""dense""? 

Now, we need to choose the next guess? But we have to guess only one? And we have two possibilities? 

Also, we haven't used D? In any guess? So we don't know about D? 

Similarly, S? We haven't used S at position 1? 

So we can guess either? But we have only 3 guesses left? Since we are on guess 3? Next is guess 4? 

The game gives 6 tries? So let's guess ""sense"" to check? Or ""dense""? 

But we want to maximize information? Or just guess? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses both possibilities? But we have to guess the word? Since we have two candidates? We can pick one? 

But note: we haven't tested S at other positions? Or D? 

So let's guess ""sense""? 

But if we guess ""sense"", and if it's not? Then we get feedback? 

Similarly? 

Also, we know that from guess 3: we had E at position 2 ✓? And position 5 ✓? So the word has E at 2? And E at 5? So if we guess ""sense"", it has those? 

Similarly, ""dense"". 

Is there another word? Like ""mense""? Or ""pense""? Probably not? So we can guess one? 

Let's guess ""dense"" because we haven't tested D? So we can learn about D? 

But if we guess ""dense"", and if it's correct? Then we win? If not? We know it must be ""sense""? So we can guess ""sense"" next? 

Similarly, guessing ""sense"": if correct? Win? If not? Must be ""dense""?

So we can guess either? 

I'll choose ""dense"" to test? 

But wait: in the word ""sense"", if we guess? But we haven't used S at position 1? And we know S is at 4? So if we get S at position 1? Then we know about S? But if we guess ""sense"": 
- Position 1: S? If the word is ""sense"", then ✓? 
- If the word is ""dense"", then for S at position 1? We get x? Because ""dense"" has D at 1? Not S? 

But we don't know? 

Actually, we don't need to? Because we are going to guess? 

So more concretely: 

Possible secret words: ""sense"" and ""dense""? 

We can pick one? I'll go with ""dense"" because we haven't tested D? And D is a common letter? 

So guess: ""dense""? 

But wait: pattern: for ""dense"": D at 1, E at 2? Which we know E at 2 is correct? Then we have E at 2? N at 3? S at 4? E at 5? 

If we guess ""dense"": 
- If it is the secret? We get all ✓? 
- If it is not? Then we get: D: but if secret is ""sense"", then D is not in the word? So x? Then positions: E:✓? N:✓? S:✓? E:✓? So D: x? Then we know it must be ""sense""? 

Similarly, if we guess ""sense"": 
- S at position 1: if secret is ""sense""? Then S: ✓? Etc? 
- If secret is ""dense"", then S at position 1: since secret has D at 1? And S at 4? So S is in the word? But not at position 1? So we get ""-"" for S? Then E:✓? N:✓? S: which is at 4? But we are placing S at position 1 and position 4? So when we place S at position 1? If secret is ""dense"", we have S at position 4? So in the word? But not at 1? So we get ""S(-)"" for position 1? And for position 4: S? But we have S at both? So position 4: ✓? Because same as before? 

Therefore, guessing ""sense"" would tell us: 
- If S: ✓? Then it must be ""sense""? 
- If S: -? Then it must be ""dense""? 

Similarly? Either way works? 

I think both are fine? But ""dense"" might be more informative? Because D is a new letter? So it tests for D? 

But since we are at guess 4? And we have two candidates? We can guess one? 

Let me choose ""dense""? 

So next guess: ""dense""?Based on the feedback from all guesses:

### Summary of Known Information:
1. **Secret Word Pattern**: From Guess 2 and Guess 3:
   - Position 2: E (✓ confirmed in Guess 3).
   - Position 3: N (✓ confirmed in Guess 3).
   - Position 4: S (✓ confirmed in Guess 2).
   - Position 5: E (✓ confirmed in Guess 1).
   - Pattern: `_ E N S E`
   - The word must end with ""ENSE"", with E and N fixed in positions 2–5.

2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, O, I, T (all marked ❌ in feedback). Cannot use these letters.

3. **Present and Position-Known Letters**: E (positions 2 and 5), N (position 3), S (position 4). All are confirmed.

### Deductions:
- **Position 1**: Must be a letter not in the excluded list (C, R, A, O, I, T). Based on common English words, valid options include:
  - ""dense"" (D at position 1)
  - ""sense"" (S at position 1, which would imply a second S)
  - Other rare words like ""mense"" or ""pense"" are uncommon and less likely.
- Since ""tense"" was guessed and T was absent, and no other common letters have been tested for position 1, the top candidates are ""dense"" and ""sense"".
- **Strategy**: Guess ""dense"" to test the letter D (a new untested common consonant). If D is absent (❌), the word must be ""sense"". If all are ✓, it solves the word.

### Guess Selection:
- ""dense"" fits the pattern `_ E N S E` and uses D (a new letter). It strictly adheres to the feedback:
  - Position 1: D (tests if present/absent and at correct position).
  - Positions 2–5 already match known letters (E, N, S, E).

This guess will resolve the remaining uncertainty efficiently.

The letter E is in the word and it is in the position 5 (since we used the 5th letter as E and it\'s correct). So the 5th letter of the secret word is E.\n2. The letter N is in the word, but not in the 4th position. It must be in one of the first four positions? But note: our word was ""crane"", which is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E. So N is in the word but not at position 4. Since position 5 is taken by E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.\n3. The letters C, R, and A are not in the word at all. So we must avoid using C, R, A in the next guess.\n\nAlso, note that the word does not contain C, R, or A.\n\nWe know the 5th letter is E. So the word ends with E.\n\nOur next guess should:\n- Contain the letter N (since it\'s present, and we know it must be in positions 1, 2, or 3). But note: in our next guess, we should try to place N in different positions to test where it might be.\n- Exclude the letters C, R, A.\n- Include other common letters to get more information.\n\nMoreover, we must keep in mind that E is fixed in position 5. So we can use E in position 5 again, but that\'s the same. We don\'t need to change that.\n\nWhat are some words that end with E and contain N? And without C, R, A.\n\nAlso, we have to avoid using letters that we know are not present: C, R, A.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit:\n- They have 5 letters, ending with E.\n- Contain N (but not in the same position as before? We don\'t know the position of N yet, but we know it\'s not at position 4? Actually, the feedback was for N: it exists but not in position 4. But it could be in position 1,2,3? But note, the word has 5 letters, so positions 1 to 5. Since position 5 is E, N must be in 1,2,3 or ... wait, position 4 is the only one we know it\'s not? Actually, we don\'t know: it could be in position 4? Wait, no: our previous word had N in position 4, and we got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not in that position. Therefore, N cannot be in position 4 of the secret word? Or could it? Wait: the feedback says it is in the word but not in the correct position? Yes. So N is in the word, but not at position 4. That implies that N must be at positions 1,2,3, or ... 5? But position 5 is E, so it\'s fixed and cannot be N? Wait: we have E at position 5 as correct. So the secret word ends with E. Therefore, N cannot be at position 5. Then N must be in positions 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo, to recap:\n- Secret word: _ _ _ _ E\n- Contains the letter N in one of the first three positions: 1, 2, or 3.\n- Does not contain C, R, A.\n\nWe have three positions to test for N.\n\nBut we also want to cover other common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nWe should try a word that has N in a different position (say position 1 or 2) and also introduces new common letters.\n\nPossible words ending with E? And containing N, but without C, R, A.\n\nLet me list some:\n- STONE: S,T,O,N,E -> note: N is at position 4? But we must avoid position 4 for N because we know N is not at position 4? Actually, we don\'t know the secret word\'s N position. But if we use ""stone"", we have N at position 4 again? We want to avoid putting N in the same position? No, we can put N in a different position? But currently we know it\'s not at position 4? Actually, we can try putting N at position 1 or 2 to check? But in ""stone"", N is at position 4. So that might not help? Actually, we can use it: because if we put N in position 4 and if it gets marked as ""x"", that would be inconsistent? But since we already know N is not at position 4? We know that from the previous feedback? Actually, the previous feedback only says that in the word ""crane"", N was present but not in position 4. It doesn\'t say that the secret word cannot have N at position 4? Wait, let me clarify:\n\nThe feedback ""-"" for N in ""crane"" (which was at position 4) means that the secret word does contain the letter N, but not at position 4. Therefore, for the secret word, N must be at a different position (1,2,3, or maybe position 5? But position 5 is E). So we must look for positions 1,2,3.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we should put N in one of positions 1,2,3 to test? Or we can put it in a position we haven\'t tested? We haven\'t tested positions 1,2,3? Actually, we only tried position 4. So we can test in position 1 or 2 or 3? But we don\'t have to test all at once? We can choose one.\n\nWe should try to choose a word that has N in position 1? And then also introduce other letters.\n\nAlso, we know E is at the end. So the word ends with E.\n\nIdea: we can use ""ONSET"" but ONSET has O,N,S,E,T. But O and T are new? And N is at position 2? And ends with E? But ""onset"" is five letters: O-N-S-E-T? But that doesn\'t end with E? It ends with T? So not ending with E? Wait, ONSET is O-N-S-E-T -> positions: 1:O, 2:N, 3:S, 4:E, 5:T. We need the word to end with E? So position 5 must be E? So we require the word to end with E.\n\nWait, the word must be: ???E.\n\nSo we need words that end with E? And containing N? Without C,R,A.\n\nOptions:\n- Consider ""LINE"": too short? It must be 5 letters. So: ""LINED""? Wait, but we need exactly 5 letters? No, we are guessing 5 letters? So we need a word that is exactly 5 letters and ends with E.\n\nExamples: phone, stone, alone, shine, etc.\n\nBut ""stone"": S-T-O-N-E. This has N at position 4? And ends with E? But N at position 4: we already know N is not at position 4? So if we guess ""stone"", then if the feedback for N is ""-"" again? Then we know N is not at 4 again? Wait, we already know N is not at 4? And let\'s see: we are going to put N at 4? Then the feedback for N might be:\n\nIf N is in the word and we put it at position 4, but the secret word doesn\'t have N at 4 (we already know that), then it should be ""-"" again? So it doesn\'t tell us anything new? So maybe we should avoid putting N at position 4? Therefore, we should put N in a position we haven\'t tried: position 1,2, or 3.\n\nSo let\'s think of words that:\n- Have N in position 1 or 2 or 3?\n- And end with E.\n- Without C,R,A.\n\nLet me try to find a word that ends with E? Also has N in position 1: \nExample: ""noise""? N-O-I-S-E? Wait, ends with E? Yes: N is at position 1? But note that ""noise"" has O and I and S? Also, note we can try ""niche""? N-I-C-H-E? Wait, but we cannot use C? Because C is excluded from the first guess feedback? We have C: x -> it\'s not in the word. So we cannot use C? So ""niche"" is invalid? Because it has C? Cannot use C,R,A.\n\nSo ""noise"" is N,O,I,S,E -> doesn\'t have C,R,A? And ends with E? And N at position 1? Okay.\n\nAnother option: ""niece""? N,I,E,C,E? Again, C is not allowed? So invalid? We cannot use C? So must avoid?\n\n""noise"": N-O-I-S-E? No C,R,A? So okay.\n\nBut what about ""tinge""? T-I-N-G-E? Ends with E? And N is at position 3? That could be? So N is at position 3? And has T,I,G? Then we can test?\n\nBut note: we also may need to avoid duplicate letters? We don\'t know if the word has duplicate? So we can still use duplicate if we don\'t know? But for maximizing information, distinct letters might be better? But let\'s check the word ""stone""? That has position 4? But if we avoid putting N at 4? Then we might avoid ""stone"".\n\nLet me consider ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? Then we are using N at the 3rd position?\n\nWe can think of:\n\n- Option 1: Put N at position 1? -> e.g., ""noise"": N,O,I,S,E.\n- Option 2: Put N at position 2? -> e.g., ""inkle""? Wait, is ""inkle"" a word? It is not common? Or ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? But note: ""unite"" ends with E? And N at position 2? And letters: U,N,I,T,E -> no C,R,A? Okay? But U is not that common? Or ""stage""? But stage has A? Avoid A? So invalid? ""spine"": S-P-I-N-E? But N is at position 4? Which we want to avoid? So no? ""shine"": S-H-I-N-E? N at position 4? Avoid? Similarly, ""phone"": P-H-O-N-E? N at 4? Avoid.\n\nWhat about ""knife"": K-N-I-F-E? Yes? That would have N at position 2? And ends with E? And letters K,N,I,F,E? No C,R,A? Okay? And we can use that? Or ""snide"": S-N-I-D-E? Ends with E? N at position 2? S,N,I,D,E? No C,R,A? Okay.\n\nOr ""sinew"": S-I-N-E-W? Ends with W? Not E? So not.\n\nAnother idea: ""owine""? Not a word? \n\nValid words: ""tinge"" (N at 3), ""noise"" (N at 1), ""knife"" (N at 2), ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Invalid? ""unite"" we considered.\n\nLet me pick ""tinge"": T-I-N-G-E? \n\nThen the feedback might tell us about N: if we put N at position 3 and if the secret word has N at position 3, it would be ✓? Otherwise, if N is elsewhere, it would be ""-""? Or if not? But we know N is not at position 4? And we are testing position 3? So if we get a ""-"" for N, then N is not at position 3? But if we get a ✓? Then we know.\n\nAlternatively, I think ""knife"" or ""noise"" are options? Also, common.\n\nBut note: we also have E in position 5? And we are repeating E? But that\'s okay.\n\nI think ""noise"" is good: \n- First letter N: if N is at position 1, then ✓? Else if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know N is in the word? So if we get ""x"" for N? Then it can\'t be? Because N is present? Actually, if we put N at position 1 and the secret word has N at position 1? Then ✓? If the secret word has N at position 2? Then we get ""-""? Similarly, if at position 3? Then we get ""-""? Because position is wrong? So it doesn\'t tell us exactly? But we will get information about the position? But note: we are introducing O, I, S? Which are common.\n\nSimilarly, with ""tinge"": letters T,I,N,G,E? We are introducing T,I,G.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if T,I,G are in the word? But that\'s the purpose? To test new letters.\n\nAlso, consider that E is already known? So we can ignore its feedback? Actually, we know E is at position 5? So we don\'t expect any feedback other than ✓? So we can focus on other positions? Actually, feedback for E should always be ✓? Because it\'s correct? So no new information? We can save a letter? But we must use E at the end? Actually, we have to? Because we know? So in the next guess, we must put E at the end? Therefore, we will get E: ✓? So we shouldn\'t waste a letter? But we are trying to test other letters? That\'s okay? So we are using the E? And then we have to guess?\n\nSo I propose ""noise""? Let me go with ""noise""? Or is there a better word?\n\nWe want maximum letter coverage? Common letters: S, T, L, N, O? We already know N is present? So we can include S and O? Also, T? How about ""stonk""? Not a word? Or ""stone""? But we avoid stone because it has N at 4? Which we already know is wrong? And the same as the previous guess? Actually, we can use ""stone"" but then we are putting N in position 4? Which we know is not correct? So it would be wasteful? Because if N is not at 4? Then we get ""-""? That\'s the same feedback? Doesn\'t help? So we avoid.\n\nTherefore, let me pick ""noise""? \n\nBut ""noise"": \n  N: let\'s see? Position 1? We don\'t know? \n  O: position 2?\n  I: position 3?\n  S: position 4?\n  E: position 5: ✓ (we know)\n\nAlso, note: we have just used S and O? They are new? They haven\'t been tested? We don\'t know about S and O.\n\nSo let\'s do it.\n\nSo my next guess: ""noise""\n\nBut wait: feedback from first guess: we also know N is present? So we must use N? But if we don\'t use N? Then we might not get information? Actually, we have to guess words? And we know N is present? So yes, we should include N? So noise includes N? Correct? Yes.\n\nTherefore, I think ""noise"" is good?\n\nAny other options? Like ""unite""? U-N-I-T-E? Which has T? As common letter? And U? Less common? Or ""knife""? K-N-I-F-E? F and K? Less common? So ""noise"" is better? Because O,I,S are more common.\n\nSo I choose ""noise"".\n\nTherefore, the next guess: ""noise""\n\nBut wait: is ""noise"" a valid word? Yes, common.\n\nSo response: <guess>noise</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is confirmed to be in position 5 (✓), so the secret word ends with E.\n- N is present in the secret word but not in position 4 (-). Since position 5 is E, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.\n- C, R, and A are absent (x) and should be avoided.\n\nFor the second guess, we need to:\n- Keep E in position 5.\n- Include N but not in position 4 (to avoid redundant feedback). I\'ve chosen to place N in position 1 to test a new location.\n- Introduce new common vowels and consonants to maximize information, avoiding C, R, A.\n- Select a valid English word ending with E.\n\nThe word ""noise"" fits these criteria:\n- Position 1: N (tests N in position 1).\n- Position 2: O (new vowel).\n- Position 3: I (new vowel).\n- Position 4: S (new consonant).\n- Position 5: E (confirmed correct).\n\nThis guess may provide useful feedback on N\'s position (if N is in position 1, it will be ✓; otherwise, -) and reveal whether O, I, or S are present.\n\n<guess>noise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- E: ✓ (correct position)\n\nGuess 2: ""noise""\n- N: - (in the word but wrong position) — so N is not at position 1 (since we placed it there in this guess)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: ✓ (correct position) — so S is in the word and at position 4\n- E: ✓ (correct position) — we already knew E is at position 5\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1.

The absent letters are C, R, A, O, I.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we need to:\n- Keep S in position 4 and E in position 5: so the last two letters must be S and E.\n- Include N in either position 2 or 3 to test its location (since it must be in one of these two positions).\n- Avoid using C, R, A, O, I.\n- Use new common letters to get more information.\n\nGiven the pattern: _ _ _ S E\n\nWe need to fill the first three positions. We know N must be in position 2 or 3. So we can try to put N in position 2 and see what happens? Or in position 3? We can choose one.\n\nAlso, we need to choose letters for the remaining positions that are common and not excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, O, I.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe should try to cover more common letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption 1: Put N in position 2: then the word is _ N _ S E\n\nWhat can the first letter be? And the third?\n\nFor example:\n- ""unuse""? But U is not excluded? But ""unuse"" is not a common word? And it has U? Also, we have to avoid O and I? But U is allowed? But ""unuse"" might not be valid? Let\'s think of valid words.\n\nBetter: ""tense"": T E N S E? But E is repeated? And we have E at position 5? But we are putting E at position 2? Wait, no: ""tense"" is T-E-N-S-E. So position 1: T, 2: E, 3: N, 4: S, 5: E. But we know position 5 is E? And position 4 is S? So that matches? But we are putting E at position 2? That might be okay? But we don\'t know if E is at position 2? Also, we have two E\'s? But the secret word might have two E\'s? We don\'t know? But from previous feedback, we only know about one E? But it could have more? So it\'s possible? But we are using E at position 2? That might be a good test? Because if E is at position 2? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if not? Then we get ""-"" or ""x""? But we know E is at position 5? So if we put E at position 2 and it\'s not in the word elsewhere? Then we get ""x""? But we know E is at 5? So if we get a ""-"" for E at position 2? That would mean there is another E? But if we get ""x""? Then no other E? So it gives information? But we are using a letter that we know is in the word? But we are testing for duplicate? That might be okay? But we are also testing N at position 3? Because in ""tense"", N is at position 3? And we know N must be at 2 or 3? So if we put N at 3? Then if it\'s correct? We get ✓? Otherwise, if N is at 2? Then we get ""-""? Because it\'s in the word but wrong position? So that would tell us? Also, we are introducing T? Which is common.\n\nBut ""tense"" has two E\'s? And we are using E at position 2? Which might not be necessary? But it\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""dense"": D-E-N-S-E? Same issue? E at position 2.\n\nTo avoid using E again? We can try a word without E in the first positions? But we have to have S and E at the end? So the word must end with SE? So the third letter can be anything? But we are putting N at 2 or 3.\n\nWhat if we put N at position 3? Then the word is _ _ N S E\n\nFor example: ""bunse""? Not a word? ""punse""? Not? ""minse""? Not common? ""winse""? Not? ""linse""? Not? ""since""? But ""since"" has C? Excluded? ""dunse""? Not? ""gunse""? Not? ""hunse""? Not? ""sunse""? Not? ""tunse""? Not? ""vinse""? Not? ""winse""? Not? ""yense""? Not? \n\nActually, common words: ""tense"", ""dense"", ""sense"" (but ""sense"" is S-E-N-S-E? Then position 1: S? But we are going to put S at position 4? And we know S is at position 4? So if we put S at position 1? Then we are testing if S is at position 1? But we know S is at position 4? So if there is another S? Then we might get ""-"" for S at position 1? Or if not? Then ""x""? But we don\'t know? So it might be okay? But ""sense"" has S at 1 and 4? And E at 2? And N at 3? So ""sense"": S(1), E(2), N(3), S(4), E(5). But we know position 4 is S? And position 5 is E? So that matches? But we are using S at position 1? And E at position 2? So we are testing for duplicate S and E? But we don\'t know if they are duplicated? So it might be a good test? But we are using N at position 3? Which is one of the possibilities.\n\nBut we have to avoid O and I? ""sense"" doesn\'t have O or I? So okay? But we are using S and E again? Which we know are in the word? But we are testing their positions? So it might be acceptable? But we are not introducing many new letters? Only S and E? But we are testing for duplicates? And N at 3.\n\nBut we need to introduce new letters? Because we have only tested a few? So maybe better to use a word with new letters? For example, ""tense"" introduces T? Which is new? And E? But we are testing E at position 2? So it\'s new information? Similarly, ""dense"" introduces D? Etc.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words that end with ""se"" and have N in position 2 or 3? And without C,R,A,O,I.\n\nFor position 2 (N at 2): pattern _ N _ S E\n\nPossible words:\n- tense: T E N S E -> T is new? E is known? But we are testing E at position 2? Also, N at 3? Wait, no: in ""tense"", N is at position 3? And the pattern is _ N _ S E? If we want N at position 2? Then it should be _ N _ S E? So for ""tense"", it is T at 1, E at 2, N at 3? So that\'s not N at 2? It\'s N at 3? So for N at position 2? We need a word like: ? N ? S E\n\nFor example: ""unsee""? U N S E E? But that\'s U at 1, N at 2, S at 3, E at 4, E at 5? But we know position 4 must be S? And position 5 E? So in ""unsee"", position 4 is E? Not S? So invalid? Because we must have S at position 4? So the word must have S at position 4? So the pattern is fixed: positions 4 and 5 are S and E? So the first three are free? But we are putting N at 2 or 3.\n\nSo for N at position 2: the word is [letter1] N [letter3] S E\n\nWhat are valid words? For example:\n- ""unset"": U N S E T? But that ends with T? Not E? So position 5 is T? But we need position 5 to be E? So not? ""unsew""? U N S E W? Ends with W? Not E? ""unsay""? But has A? Excluded? And ends with Y? Not E? ""unseam""? Too long? ""unseal""? Too long? ""unseam"" is 6? So not 5? \n\nActually, I can\'t think of a common word with pattern ? N ? S E? Because the ? at position 3 must be a letter that with S and E? But the word must be a valid English word? Like ""anise""? But ""anise"" has A? Excluded? ""unite"" is not? ""knife"" is not? \n\nPerhaps ""insee""? Not a word? ""ensew""? Not? \n\nSo maybe there are no common words with N at position 2 and ending with SE? So we must put N at position 3? Then pattern: _ _ N S E\n\nThen we have words like:\n- tense: T E N S E -> T at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? But E at 2? And we are using E again? But it\'s okay? Because we are testing if E is at position 2? Also, we are putting N at 3? Which is one of the possibilities? So if N is at 3? Then we get ✓? Otherwise, if N is at 2? Then we get ""-"" for N? Because it\'s in the word but wrong position? So that tells us N is at 2? So it\'s good? And we introduce T? Which is new? So ""tense"" seems good? \n\nOther options: ""dense"": D E N S E? Similarly? D at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Introduces D? \n\n""sense"": S E N S E? S at 1, E at 2, N at 3, S at 4, E at 5? Introduces S at 1? But we know S is at 4? So if we get a ✓ for S at 1? Then there is another S? If we get ""-""? Then S is at 4 only? But we are using S at 1? And we know S is at 4? So if we get ""x"" for S at 1? That would mean no other S? But if we get ""-""? Then there is another S? So it gives information? But we are using a slot? \n\nBut we have to choose? Also, ""mense""? Not common? ""pense""? Not? ""lense""? L E N S E? Which is a word? Lens with e? But sometimes accepted? \n\n""tense"" is a common word? So I think ""tense"" is a good choice? \n\nBut we are using E at position 2? Which might be redundant? But it tests for duplicate E? And we don\'t know if there is another E? So it\'s new information? \n\nAlternatively, we can avoid using E? But then we might not have many options? For example, ""bunse"" is not a word? ""gunse"" not? ""minse"" not? ""winse"" not? ""lynse"" not? ""punse"" not? \n\nSo I think ""tense"" is acceptable? \n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word without E in the first positions? For example, ""towns""? But ends with S? Not SE? ""downs""? Not? \n\nAnother idea: ""minus""? But ends with S? Not E? ""finis""? Ends with S? Not E? \n\nSo I think we have to use a word that has E at the end? And we are stuck with the pattern? So ""tense"" or ""dense"" or ""sense"" are the options? \n\nAmong these, ""tense"" introduces T? Which is common? And we haven\'t used T? So better than ""sense"" which introduces S again? But ""sense"" has S at 1? Which is new? But we are testing S? \n\nBut I think ""tense"" is better? Because T is a new letter? \n\nSo I choose ""tense"". \n\nTherefore, the next guess: ""tense""\n\nBut let\'s double-check the pattern: we are putting N at position 3? And we know N must be at 2 or 3? So if we get feedback for N: \n- If N is at position 3? Then ✓? \n- If N is at position 2? Then we get ""-"" for N? Because it\'s in the word but not at 3? \n\nAlso, for E at position 2: \n- If E is at position 2? Then ✓? \n- If not? Then if there is another E? We get ""-""? Or if not? We get ""x""? \n\nAnd T at position 1: \n- If T is in the word? And at position 1? Then ✓? \n- If T is in the word but not at 1? Then ""-""? \n- If T is not in the word? Then ""x""? \n\nSo we get information about T and E? And N? \n\nAlso, we avoid C,R,A,O,I? \n\nSo it seems good? \n\nTherefore, I go with ""tense"". \n\n<guess>tense</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)**  \n  - E is in the correct position (position 5).  \n  - N is in the word but not in position 4.  \n  - C, R, A are absent.\n\n- **Guess 2: ""noise"" → Feedback: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)**  \n  - S is in the correct position (position 4).  \n  - E is still in the correct position (position 5).  \n  - N is in the word but not in position 1.  \n  - O and I are absent.\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ _ S E` (S in position 4, E in position 5).\n2. N is present but not in positions 1 or 4. Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, N must be in position 2 or 3.\n3. Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I (cannot be used).\n4. Present letters: N, S, E (with S and E fixed in positions 4 and 5).\n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n- Test N in position 3 (since position 1 was already tested and ruled out, and position 4 is fixed as S). If N is in position 3, it will show ✓; if not, it will show - (indicating N is in position 2).\n- Introduce new common letters (e.g., T, D, L) to maximize information, avoiding absent letters.\n- Use a valid 5-letter word ending in ""SE"" (to match the fixed S and E).\n\nThe word **""tense""** fits perfectly:\n- **T**: New common consonant (tests position 1).\n- **E**: In position 2 (tests for duplicate E; if E is here, it shows ✓; if not, it may show - or x).\n- **N**: In position 3 (tests if N is here or in position 2).\n- **S**: Fixed in position 4 (will show ✓).\n- **E**: Fixed in position 5 (will show ✓).\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows down N\'s position and checks for duplicate E while introducing T.\n\n<guess>tense</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 3: tense -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: - (in the word, wrong position) – so N is in the word but not at position 4\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so letter 5 is E)\n\nGuess 2: ""noise""\n- N: - (in the word, wrong position) – so N is not at position 1\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- S: ✓ (correct position, so letter 4 is S)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, letter 5 is E)\n\nSo after guess 2, we know:\n- The word ends with SE (positions 4 and 5 are S and E)\n- N is in the word but not in positions 1 or 4. Since the word is _ _ _ S E, N must be in position 2 or 3.\n- Letters not in the word: C, R, A, O, I.\n\nGuess 3: ""tense""\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (so position 2 E is correct? But note: we placed E at position 2. The ✓ indicates that E is at position 2? But wait, we have two E\'s? And the feedback for position 2 E is ✓? That means E is at position 2? And also we have E at position 5 ✓? So the word has E at position 2 and 5? And E is at position 5? Wait, let\'s parse:\n- T at position 1: x (T not in the word)\n- E at position 2: ✓ (so E is in the word at position 2? And we know from previous that E is also at position 5? So at least two E\'s? But note, we have E at position 2 and 5? So the word has E at position 2 and 5?\n- N at position 3: ✓ (so N is at position 3? Therefore, we found N at position 3? Which is consistent? Because we knew N was at 2 or 3? And now we get ✓ at position 3? So it\'s fixed? At position 3?\n- S at position 4: ✓ (as expected? We knew S at 4? So no new information?)\n- E at position 5: ✓ (as expected)\n\nSo feedback: T(x), E(✓), N(✓), S(✓), E(✓) – meaning:\n- T is absent? So not in the word? We can add T to the absent letters?\n- E at position 2 is correct? So the secret word has E at position 2? \n- N at position 3 is correct? So N at position 3?\n- S at 4 and E at 5? As before?\n\nTherefore, we now know:\n- Secret word pattern: _ E N S E? Positions: 1: unknown, 2: E, 3: N, 4: S, 5: E? So the secret word is ? E N S E? \n- But note: are there two E\'s? Because position 2 and 5 are both E? And maybe others? But we don\'t know? Also, we have N at position 3? \n- Absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, T (from guess 3)\n\nNow, what letters can be at position 1? We need a 5-letter word of the form ? E N S E? That must be a valid English word? And without using C,R,A,O,I,T? And the letter at position 1 must be from the remaining alphabet? \n\nPossible words: \nThe pattern is X E N S E? \n\nWhat English words fit? For example: \n- ""cense""? But C is excluded? \n- ""sense""? But we have ""sense"": S E N S E? Then it has two S\'s? And S at position 4? Also, S at position 1? But we haven\'t used S at position 1? And we know S is at position 4? But we don\'t know about another S? So ""sense"" might be possible? But we are missing: what are the letters? Position 1: S? \nBut is S present twice? We don\'t know? But in guess 2: ""noise"" had S at position 4? And if ""sense"" were the secret word? Then in guess 2: ""noise"" would have shown S at position 4? Which was ✓? And S at position 1? But in guess 2, we didn\'t test position 1? So S at position 1 would not be tested? So it could be? Also, in guess 2, we had N at position 1? Which was not correct? But in guess 3, ""tense"" would be T E N S E? Which, if secret is ""sense"": then the feedback? Position 1: T (x? Because secret S? And T not in word? So yes? Then E: ✓? N: ✓? S: ✓? E: ✓? So matches? \n\nBut does ""sense"" use only the available letters? S,E,N? And we haven\'t eliminated S? Also, excluded letters: C,R,A,O,I,T? So S is allowed? Because we haven\'t been told S is absent? Actually, we know S is at position 4? So it is present? But we can have another S? \n\nSo ""sense"" is a valid word? But let\'s check: the pattern is S E N S E? Position 1: S? Position 2: E? Position 3: N? Position 4: S? Position 5: E? So it ends with SE? And has E,E? Etc? \n\nBut are there other words? For example, ""dense"": D E N S E? D is not excluded? But in guess 3? We used T? But that was absent? Now, ""dense"" has D? We haven\'t used D? So then? \n\nWait: in guess 3: we guessed ""tense""? And the feedback for T: x? So T is absent? But D is not excluded? So ""dense"" would be D E N S E? Then if we guess? But we need to think? \n\nAlso, ""mense""? Not common? ""lense""? L E N S E? Which is a variant of lens? Or ""wense""? Not? ""pense""? Not? \n\nSo common words: ""sense"", ""dense"", ""tense"" we already guess? So ""sense"" and ""dense""? \n\nBut ""tense"" we just guessed? So it\'s not a candidate? Because we got T: x? And E,N,S,E as above? So the word is not ""tense""? \n\nSo possible candidates: ""sense"" and ""dense""? \n\nBut we don\'t know the first letter? It could be S? Or D? Or others? \n\nWhat about ""fense""? Not? ""gense""? Not? ""hense""? Not? ""kense""? Not? ""mense""? Not? ""yense""? Not? \n\n""Bense""? Not common? \n\nSo likely, the word is ""sense"" or ""dense""? Or? \n\nBut note: the secret word must have E at 2 and 5? N at 3? S at 4? So only position 1? \n\nIn guess 1: ""crane"" had N at position 4? And we got N: -? Meaning N was in the word but wrong position? But in ""sense"": N is at position 3? So when we put N at position 4? It should be marked as ""-"" because it\'s in the word at position 3? So correct? And for ""dense""? Same? \n\nIn guess 2: ""noise"" had N at position 1? Which was ""-""? And for ""sense"", N at position 1? But ""sense"" doesn\'t have N at position 1? So in guess 2: if secret was ""sense"", we placed N at position 1? But secret N is at 3? So it should show ""-""? Which it did? So consistent? \n\nSimilarly, for ""dense""? \n\nNow, we need to choose the next guess? But we have to guess only one? And we have two possibilities? \n\nAlso, we haven\'t used D? In any guess? So we don\'t know about D? \n\nSimilarly, S? We haven\'t used S at position 1? \n\nSo we can guess either? But we have only 3 guesses left? Since we are on guess 3? Next is guess 4? \n\nThe game gives 6 tries? So let\'s guess ""sense"" to check? Or ""dense""? \n\nBut we want to maximize information? Or just guess? \n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that uses both possibilities? But we have to guess the word? Since we have two candidates? We can pick one? \n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested S at other positions? Or D? \n\nSo let\'s guess ""sense""? \n\nBut if we guess ""sense"", and if it\'s not? Then we get feedback? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nAlso, we know that from guess 3: we had E at position 2 ✓? And position 5 ✓? So the word has E at 2? And E at 5? So if we guess ""sense"", it has those? \n\nSimilarly, ""dense"". \n\nIs there another word? Like ""mense""? Or ""pense""? Probably not? So we can guess one? \n\nLet\'s guess ""dense"" because we haven\'t tested D? So we can learn about D? \n\nBut if we guess ""dense"", and if it\'s correct? Then we win? If not? We know it must be ""sense""? So we can guess ""sense"" next? \n\nSimilarly, guessing ""sense"": if correct? Win? If not? Must be ""dense""?\n\nSo we can guess either? \n\nI\'ll choose ""dense"" to test? \n\nBut wait: in the word ""sense"", if we guess? But we haven\'t used S at position 1? And we know S is at 4? So if we get S at position 1? Then we know about S? But if we guess ""sense"": \n- Position 1: S? If the word is ""sense"", then ✓? \n- If the word is ""dense"", then for S at position 1? We get x? Because ""dense"" has D at 1? Not S? \n\nBut we don\'t know? \n\nActually, we don\'t need to? Because we are going to guess? \n\nSo more concretely: \n\nPossible secret words: ""sense"" and ""dense""? \n\nWe can pick one? I\'ll go with ""dense"" because we haven\'t tested D? And D is a common letter? \n\nSo guess: ""dense""? \n\nBut wait: pattern: for ""dense"": D at 1, E at 2? Which we know E at 2 is correct? Then we have E at 2? N at 3? S at 4? E at 5? \n\nIf we guess ""dense"": \n- If it is the secret? We get all ✓? \n- If it is not? Then we get: D: but if secret is ""sense"", then D is not in the word? So x? Then positions: E:✓? N:✓? S:✓? E:✓? So D: x? Then we know it must be ""sense""? \n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""sense"": \n- S at position 1: if secret is ""sense""? Then S: ✓? Etc? \n- If secret is ""dense"", then S at position 1: since secret has D at 1? And S at 4? So S is in the word? But not at position 1? So we get ""-"" for S? Then E:✓? N:✓? S: which is at 4? But we are placing S at position 1 and position 4? So when we place S at position 1? If secret is ""dense"", we have S at position 4? So in the word? But not at 1? So we get ""S(-)"" for position 1? And for position 4: S? But we have S at both? So position 4: ✓? Because same as before? \n\nTherefore, guessing ""sense"" would tell us: \n- If S: ✓? Then it must be ""sense""? \n- If S: -? Then it must be ""dense""? \n\nSimilarly? Either way works? \n\nI think both are fine? But ""dense"" might be more informative? Because D is a new letter? So it tests for D? \n\nBut since we are at guess 4? And we have two candidates? We can guess one? \n\nLet me choose ""dense""? \n\nSo next guess: ""dense""?Based on the feedback from all guesses:\n\n### Summary of Known Information:\n1. **Secret Word Pattern**: From Guess 2 and Guess 3:\n   - Position 2: E (✓ confirmed in Guess 3).\n   - Position 3: N (✓ confirmed in Guess 3).\n   - Position 4: S (✓ confirmed in Guess 2).\n   - Position 5: E (✓ confirmed in Guess 1).\n   - Pattern: `_ E N S E`\n   - The word must end with ""ENSE"", with E and N fixed in positions 2–5.\n\n2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, O, I, T (all marked ❌ in feedback). Cannot use these letters.\n\n3. **Present and Position-Known Letters**: E (positions 2 and 5), N (position 3), S (position 4). All are confirmed.\n\n### Deductions:\n- **Position 1**: Must be a letter not in the excluded list (C, R, A, O, I, T). Based on common English words, valid options include:\n  - ""dense"" (D at position 1)\n  - ""sense"" (S at position 1, which would imply a second S)\n  - Other rare words like ""mense"" or ""pense"" are uncommon and less likely.\n- Since ""tense"" was guessed and T was absent, and no other common letters have been tested for position 1, the top candidates are ""dense"" and ""sense"".\n- **Strategy**: Guess ""dense"" to test the letter D (a new untested common consonant). If D is absent (❌), the word must be ""sense"". If all are ✓, it solves the word.\n\n### Guess Selection:\n- ""dense"" fits the pattern `_ E N S E` and uses D (a new letter). It strictly adheres to the feedback:\n  - Position 1: D (tests if present/absent and at correct position).\n  - Positions 2–5 already match known letters (E, N, S, E).\n\nThis guess will resolve the remaining uncertainty efficiently.\n\n<guess>dense</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(✓)\nGuess 2: noise -> FEEDBACK: N(-) O(x) I(x) S(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 3: tense -> FEEDBACK: T(x) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 4: dense -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(✓) N(✓) S(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>

- E: ✓ (so E is at position 2? Since we placed E at position 2? And it was correct? Meaning E is at position 2? And since E is also at position 5? So two E's? Or the same E? We don't know? But the feedback shows E at two positions? So yes? Position 2 E is correct? So at least two E's? Or we don't know? But the feedback for each E is per position? So E at position 2? And E at position 5? So the word has E in both positions? 
- N: ✓ (so N at position 3? Since we placed N at position 3? Correct? So position 3 is N)
- S: ✓ (position 4? Correct? Known)
- E: ✓ (position 5? Known)

So after guess 3? We know: 
Secret word pattern: _ E N S E? Position 1? Unknown? Position 2: E? Position 3: N? Position 4: S? Position 5: E? 

And absent letters: C, R, A, O, I, T? 

Guess 4: ""dense""
- D: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (position 2? Correct? Known)
- N: ✓ (position 3? Known)
- S: ✓ (position 4? Known)
- E: ✓ (position 5? Known)

So the only information we get? D is absent? So no D? 

Therefore? The secret word pattern: ? E N S E? Where the first letter is not C,R,A,O,I,T,D? 

What letters remain? And what words? 

The word must be a valid English word? So the pattern X E N S E? 

We've eliminated: C,R,A,O,I,T,D? 

What are possible candidates? 

Common words: ""sense"" (S E N S E)? Which has two S's? 

Is there another word? For example? ""mense""? Not common? ""pense""? Not common? ""gense""? Not? ""lense""? Somewhat acceptable? But less common? ""bense""? Not? ""fense""? Not common? ""kense""? Not? ""vense""? Not? ""wense""? Not? ""yense""? Not? 

So the only reasonable word? Is ""sense""? 

Let me check ""sense"": 
Positions: 1:S? 2:E? 3:N? 4:S? 5:E? 

In previous guesses? 
Guess 1: ""crane"" had N at position 4? Feedback was N: -? Which is correct? Because N is in the word at position 3? Not position 4? So the ""-"" means it's present? But wrong position? 

Guess 2: ""noise"" had N at position 1? Feedback was ""-""? Meaning N is in the word? But not at position 1? Which is correct? Because N is at position 3? 

Guess 3: ""tense"" had T at position 1? Feedback x? Correct? T not in word? Then E at position 2? ✓? Because E is at position 2? N at position 3? ✓? S at position 4? ✓? E at position 5? ✓? 

Guess 4: ""dense"" had D at position 1? Feedback x? Because D not in word? Then the rest ✓? 

So if the word is ""sense""? Then all feedback is consistent? 

Moreover? We have not guessed ""sense"" yet? So it might be? 

Therefore? We should guess ""sense"" as our next guess? 

Since we have only two possibilities? And all others are ruled out? 

So next guess: ""sense""? 

Let's confirm the absent letters? 
Excluded: C, R, A, O, I, T, D? So S is not excluded? We placed S at position 4? And the feedback was ✓? And S at position 1? We haven't tested? 

In ""sense""? Position 1 is S? So we are testing? But we know S is at position 4? So if we get a ✓ for S at position 1? It means S is at both positions? 

But since ""sense"" is the only likely word? We go with it? 

Therefore? guess 5: ""sense""?

### Updated Analysis of Feedback:

1. **Pattern Confirmation**:
   - **Positions 2–5**: Fixed as `E N S E` (from Guess 3 and Guess 4 feedback).
   - **Pattern**: `_ E N S E`  
   - **Known letters**:  
     - Position 2: E (✓)  
     - Position 3: N (✓)  
     - Position 4: S (✓)  
     - Position 5: E (✓)  

2. **Absent Letters** (from all feedback):  
   C, R, A, O, I, T, D (all marked ❌). These **cannot be used**.  

3. **Letter Pool for Position 1**:
   - Must be a valid English letter, **not** in the absent list above.  
   - Common possibilities: B, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

4. **Word Candidates**:
   - The word must fit `? E N S E`.  
   - **""sense""**: S at position 1 (implying a second S).  
     - Why it fits:  
       - Compatible with all feedback (e.g., N not in position 1/4 initially, S fixed at position 4).  
       - No conflicts with absent letters.  
   - Other possibilities (e.g., ""mense"", ""pense"") are obscure or invalid.  

### Why ""sense""?
- **Tests Position 1**: If S is correct (✓), the word is ""sense"". If S is ""wrong position"" (-), it suggests a different letter (e.g., ""lense""*), but ""sense"" is the strongest candidate.
- **Resolves Uncertainty**: With only position 1 unknown, guessing ""sense"" leverages high-frequency S to close the game or reveal the solution.
