We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
  R: x (R is not in the secret word)
  A: x (A is not in the secret word)
  N: - (N is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
  E: x (E is not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback we know:
  - The secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
  - The secret word does not contain R, A, or E.

We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Includes C and N (since they are present in the secret word) and excludes R, A, E.
  - The letter C cannot be in the first position (because in ""crane"" it was first and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
  - The letter N cannot be in the fourth position (because in ""crane"" it was fourth and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).

We can also consider that the word might have other common letters.

Let's think of words that have C and N, and avoid R, A, E.

Common consonants: we can try to use S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

We also note that the word must have exactly 5 letters and be a valid English word.

Possible words:
  - We can try to put C in a different position (not first) and N in a different position (not fourth).

Let me think of words that have C and N, without R, A, E.

For example:
  - ""CLINT"": but we don't know if L, I, T are allowed? We haven't ruled them out. However, we must avoid R, A, E.

But let's check: 
  C is in position 1? We know C cannot be in position 1. So if we use ""CLINT"", C is in position 1 again -> not allowed.

We need to put C in a position other than 1. Similarly, N should not be in position 4.

Let me try to put C in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, N can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Another idea: since we have two letters to place (C and N) and we know they are in the word, we can try a word that has C and N and three new letters.

Let me think of words that have C and N, without R, A, E.

Some words:
  - ""NICOL"": but that's 5 letters? Actually, ""NICOL"" is not common. Maybe ""COLIN""? But ""COLIN"" has C in first position? We cannot have C in first.

Wait, ""COLIN"": 
  C is first -> not allowed.

  - ""CONIC"": but that has two C's? And also O and I. Let's see: 
    C in first position -> not allowed.

  - ""CINCT"": not a word.

  - ""SCION"": 
      S, C, I, O, N -> avoids R, A, E.
      C is in second position -> okay (since we haven't tried that position for C).
      N is in fifth position -> okay (not fourth).

But we must check if the word is valid. ""SCION"" is a valid English word.

Alternatively, ""SONIC"": 
  S, O, N, I, C -> 
    C is in fifth position -> okay.
    N is in third position -> okay (not fourth).

But note: we have to avoid the letters R, A, E.

Both ""SCION"" and ""SONIC"" avoid these.

Another one: ""ONCET"" is not a word.

""INCUT"": not common.

""UNCOG"": not common.

So, let's choose between ""SCION"" and ""SONIC"". Both are valid.

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but the feedback didn't show any duplicates so far.

We can also consider ""CONUS"" but C is first -> not allowed.

Another word: ""MUCIN"": 
  M, U, C, I, N -> 
    C is in third position -> okay.
    N is in fifth position -> okay.

But we don't know if M, U, I are in the word? We are trying to test new letters.

We want to maximize information. We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

In ""SCION"": we have S, C, I, O, N -> we are testing S, I, O as well.

In ""SONIC"": we have S, O, N, I, C -> same letters.

But note: the positions matter.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has C and N and also includes other common letters we haven't tested, such as T, L, etc.

For example: ""CLINT"" is invalid because C is first.

How about ""TONIC"": 
  T, O, N, I, C -> 
    C is fifth -> okay.
    N is third -> okay.

But we have O and I again.

Another: ""CUTIN"": 
  C is first -> invalid.

""UNLIT"" doesn't have C or N.

We need both C and N.

So, let's go with ""SCION"" or ""SONIC"". 

I think ""SONIC"" is a more common word? But both are acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try ""NICKS"": 
  N, I, C, K, S -> 
    N is first -> okay (we haven't had N in first, so it's allowed? The feedback only said N is in the word but not in the fourth position. It could be in first).
    C is third -> okay (not first, so allowed).
    Avoids R, A, E.

But note: we have two new letters: K and S.

However, we already know that the word has C and N, so we must include them.

I think ""SONIC"" is a good choice because:
  - It has S, O, N, I, C: all common letters.
  - We avoid R, A, E.
  - C is in the last position (which we haven't tried) and N is in the third (which is not the fourth).

So, let's guess ""SONIC"".

But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know, but we'll see from feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't reuse positions we haven't tested? Actually, we have to test new positions.

I think ""SONIC"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""SONIC"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- R, A, and E are not in the secret word (marked as x).
- N is in the secret word but not in position 4 (marked as -).

The new guess must:
- Include C and N (since they are in the secret word).
- Exclude R, A, and E (since they are not in the secret word).
- Avoid placing C in position 1 or N in position 4 (as per the feedback).

After considering words that fit these constraints, ""SONIC"" is a valid choice:
- It contains C (in position 5) and N (in position 3), avoiding the forbidden positions.
- It excludes R, A, and E.
- It introduces new common letters (S, O, I) to gather more information.

    N is first -> okay (we haven't had N in first, so it's allowed? The feedback only said N is in the word but not in the fourth position. It could be in first).
    C is third -> okay (not first, so allowed).
    Avoids R, A, E.

But note: we have two new letters: K and S.

However, we already know that the word has C and N, so we must include them.

I think ""SONIC"" is a good choice because:
  - It has S, O, N, I, C: all common letters.
  - We avoid R, A, E.
  - C is in the last position (which we haven't tried) and N is in the third (which is not the fourth).

So, let's guess ""SONIC"".

But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know, but we'll see from feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't reuse positions we haven't tested? Actually, we have to test new positions.

I think ""SONIC"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""SONIC"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- R, A, and E are not in the secret word (marked as x).
- N is in the secret word but not in position 4 (marked as -).

The new guess must:
- Include C and N (since they are in the secret word).
- Exclude R, A, and E (since they are not in the secret word).
- Avoid placing C in position 1 or N in position 4 (as per the feedback).

After considering words that fit these constraints, ""SONIC"" is a valid choice:
- It contains C (in position 5) and N (in position 3), avoiding the forbidden positions.
- It excludes R, A, and E.
- It introduces new common letters (S, O, I) to gather more information.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
   This tells us:
   - C is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, A, E are not in the word.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

2. ""sonic"": S(x), O(-), N(-), I(x), C(-)
   This tells us:
   - S and I are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and got '-', meaning it is present but not there).
   - N is in the word but not in position 3 (guessed in position 3, got '-').
   - C is in the word but not in position 5 (guessed in position 5, got '-').

Now, combining the information:

Letters known to be in the word: C, N, O (because C and N were confirmed in the first guess, and O is confirmed in the second guess).

Letters known to be absent: R, A, E (from first guess), S, I (from second guess).

Positions:
- C is not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). Therefore, C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Therefore, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- O is not in position 2 (from second guess) and could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We now have the known letters: C, N, O. We know the word must contain these three letters. Since the word is 5 letters, there are two more letters we don't know yet. We must avoid R, A, E, S, I.

We have 6 tries, so we can make an educated guess that includes C in positions 2, 3, or 4; N in positions 1, 2, or 5; and O not in position 2.

Let's think of words that include C, N, O and avoid R, A, E, S, I.

Common letters that might appear: T, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

We want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down.

Also, note the positions.

For example, N cannot be in position 3 or 4, so options for N: 1, 2, 5.

C cannot be in position 1 or 5, so positions 2, 3, 4.

O can be anywhere but 2.

Let's try to build words:

Case 1: N in position 1.
   Then positions: N _ _ _ _
   C must be in 2,3,4.
   O in 3,4,5 (since not 2).

Example words with N first and avoiding forbidden letters: 
   N O T C H? But H is new. Let's check: NOTCH has O in 2? That would be position 2 for O, but O cannot be in position 2? Wait no: the feedback says O is not in position 2, but it could be elsewhere. In NOTCH: O is in position 2? We can't place O in position 2 because in ""sonic"" O was in position 2 and got '-', meaning O is not in position 2. So NOTCH: O must be placed? If N is first, and we put O in 2: that would be invalid because O cannot be in position 2.

So for N in position 1, we must avoid putting O in position 2. So O must be in 3,4,5.

Possible words:
   N _ O _ _ : Then we have C to place in 2,4,5? But wait: we must include C. Position 2 is free. So if O is in 3, then position 2 could be C? But C can be in position 2.

Example: N C O _ _? What letters? We have two more. Must avoid R,A,E,S,I. Words: NCO something? Not common: NCOMB? No, NCOLD? No.

Alternatively, N in 1, O in 4: N _ _ O _ 
  Then C could be in 2 or 3? Position 5 is possible? But C cannot be in position 5? Because of the feedback? Wait: from second guess C was in position 5 and got '-', meaning C is not in position 5. So C cannot be in position 5. Therefore, C must be in position 2 or 3.

So for N in 1 and O in 4:
  N ? ? O ?
  ? can be C in 2 or 3, but also another letter.

For example: N O C O D? Duplicate O? Probably not. Or ""NODUL"" has no C.

Not easy.

Case 2: N in position 2.
   Then: _ N _ _ _
   C must be in position 3 or 4 (since not 1,5; and position 2 is taken by N).
   O must not be in position 2 (already taken) so O in 1,3,4,5.

But position 1 could be O: then O N ? ? ?

Then if C is in position 3: O N C ? ?

Avoiding bad letters: O N C H T? ""ONCET"" isn't a word. O N C U T? ""ONCUT""? Not a word.

If O is not first, then: for example, if O is in 3: _ N O _ _ then C in 4? So _ N O C _.

Possible words: U N O C K? But U and K: ""UNOCK"" not word. T N O C H? Doesn't work.

Case 3: N in position 5.
   Then: _ _ _ _ N
   C must be in 2,3,4.
   O can be in 1,3,4 (not 2).

Example: if O is in 1: O _ _ _ N
   Then C in 2,3,4.

For example: O _ C _ N? Like ""O C E A N"" but E and A are eliminated? A and E are out.

Cannot use E or A.

Try O _ _ C N? And avoid bad letters: O T T C N? ""OTTCN"" no.

Also, we must have two more letters? Actually, we have three known letters: O, C, N. So when N is in 5 and O in 1, then positions 2 and 3 need to be filled, and C must be in one of 2,3,4? But position 4 is the only one left for C? Not exactly, position 4 is available but so are 2 and 3.

Actually, positions: 
  1: O
  5: N
  Then positions 2,3,4: two letters? No, three positions: so we need to put C and two more letters.

C can be in position 2,3, or 4.

Example: O C _ _ N: must fill positions 3 and 4. But we cannot have S,I,R,A,E. So letters like T, U, L, M, etc.

Word: OC T O N? ""OCTON"" is not a valid word? Actually, ""OCTAN"" is not allowed because A is eliminated? Also, duplicate O? We might not have duplicate.

Actually, ""OCEAN"" has A and E -> invalid.

Possible: ""OCULN""? Not a word.

Alternatively, place C in position 4: O _ _ C N -> then we have positions 2 and 3: so O ? ? C N.

Words: O M I C N? but I is invalid. O V I C N? I invalid. O L L C N? Not word.

This is difficult.

Another idea: we haven't considered the possibility of duplicate letters. But so far, we don't have any indication of duplicates.

Let's think of all common words with C, N, O without the forbidden letters.

We know that the word must contain C, N, O and two other letters from the remaining alphabet except R,A,E,S,I.

We can choose from: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And position constraints.

For example, the word ""COUNT"": 
   C O U N T -> 
   But let's check the positions: 
      C is in position 1 -> not allowed! Because from first guess, C cannot be in position 1.

Rejected.

Word ""FOCUS"": has S -> S is eliminated.

Word ""LOCUM"": no C? Wait, it has C? L O C U M -> C is in position 3? 
  But we don't know if L, U, M are allowed? But also, this word does not have N? But N is required.

So must have N.

Word ""ONION"": but I is eliminated? And also has two O's? But I is not allowed.

Word ""CONDO"": C in first? Not allowed.

Word ""MONTH"": M O N T H -> 
   Does it have C? Actually, no C -> but C is required.

We must have C.

Word ""CONCH"": C in first -> not allowed.

Word ""PINCH"": I is eliminated? And also P is new? But I is not allowed.

How about ""CLOWN"": C in first? Not allowed.

""BUNCO"": B U N C O -> 
   Positions: 
     B:1, U:2, N:3, C:4, O:5
   Check constraints:
     C is in position 4 -> allowed (since C cannot be in 1 or 5, so 4 is fine).
     N is in position 3 -> not allowed? Because from the second guess, we had N in position 3 and got '-', meaning N cannot be in position 3! Therefore, in ""BUNCO"", N is in position 3 -> invalid.

So no.

Word ""NOVICE"": 6 letters? Not enough, must be 5.

Wait, we are only looking for 5-letter words.

Another idea: ""UNCOS"" -> S is eliminated? And also O? But UNCOS is 5 letters? But S at the end -> S is eliminated.

Avoid S.

Perhaps ""DOUCN"" -> but not a word.

Let me think of words ending with N and containing C and O.

For example: _ _ _ _ N, with C in 2,3,4 and O in 1,3,4.

Example: if O is in 1 and C in 4: O _ _ C N -> as before, hard.

Place O in 4: _ _ _ O N. Then C in 2 or 3? Position 1 is available.

So: ? ? C O N -> but we don't know if that word exists? Like B A C O N -> A eliminated? A is bad.

T U C O N? Not word.

L U C O N? Not word.

What if O in 3: _ _ O _ N. Then C can be in 2 or 4? 
  If C in 4: _ _ O C N -> then positions 1,2: like T O O C N? T O O C N -> not word. Or word ""GLOBU N"" no.

Alternatively, C in position 2: _ C O _ N -> then positions 1 and 4: U C O M N? Not word. E C O L N? E is eliminated.

Perhaps we haven't considered N in position 2? 

Earlier cases were hard.

Another common word: ""CONQUER"" is too long.

Wait, what about ""COUNT"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

Perhaps ""CROON"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid and R is eliminated.

Let's try a different approach. We know the word has C, N, O. And two other letters.

We also know N cannot be in position 3 or 4, and C cannot be in 1 or 5.

Set the positions:

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

For C: positions 2,3,4
For N: positions 1,2,5
For O: any position except 2.

Let's list possible combinations for these three letters:

We can have:
- N at 1, O at 3, C at 4: then positions 2 and 5 -> N, O, C are placed: 1:N, 3:O, 4:C, so positions 2 and 5 to fill.
   Word: N ? O C ?
   Must be two new letters excluding R,A,E,S,I.

   Can we find a word: N L O C K -> ""NLOCK"" not word. 
   N O O C H -> double O? And O in 2? But O cannot be in position 2? Here O is in position 3 -> allowed. But position 2 is 'O'? In the feedback O is not in position 2, so we can put O in 3? But position 2 is a different letter: so we are putting O in 3, not 2? That's fine. But ""NOOCH"" not a word.

   Alternatively, N O L C H? Not word.

   N U O C K -> not word.

   This doesn't yield.

- Another combination: N at 1, O at 4, C at 3: of course, we already had constraint that O can be at 4? Then positions: 1:N, 3:C, 4:O, then positions 2,5: e.g. N E C O R -> filled with forbidden.

   N at 1, O at 5, C at 2: positions 1:N, 2:C (allowed?), position 5:O, then positions 3,4. 
   C is in position 2 -> allowed? Yes, because C was not tried in position 2 before? We only have C in position 1 and 5 tried and forbidden? So position 2 is new. 
   So: N C ? ? O -> must fill positions 3,4. Avoid R,A,E,S,I.
   Possible words: N C L E O -> E and A are not? E is eliminated. 
   N C U L O -> ""NCULO"" not word.
   N C T U O -> ""NCTUO"" no.

Not working.

Try N at 5. Also, O at 1 and C at 3: as we had.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""CONTO""? But C in position 1 -> invalid.

Let's extend our letter pool. Since we have to find a word, we might try a word that also tests common letters.

We know the word has C, N, O. We need to find what the other two letters are.

We can try words that include T, which is common.

For example: ""N O T C H"" -> but C in position 4 and N at 1, but the word wouldn't have O because we haven't placed O? Actually, we must have O.

Alternatively, ""C O N T H"" -> C in first -> invalid.

""T O N C H"" -> T in position 1, O in 2: but O cannot be in position 2! -> invalid.

But O is in position 2 -> cannot be because we know O is not in position 2.

So put O elsewhere.

For example: T _ O _ _ N? But that's 6 positions.

5-letter only.

Perhaps: _ _ _ _ N with O and C inside.

Let's consider the word ""YOUNG"": has no C? Not required.

We might need to consider that the secret word might contain one of the letters twice? For example, let's assume no duplicates, which is not always the case.

But from feedback, for ""sonic"", there was no duplicate feedback, so probably no duplicates.

Another word: ""NONCE"" -> but E is eliminated? ""NONCE"" has E -> invalid.

""BOUND"" -> has no C.

 let's recall the feedback for ""crane"": the C must be in the word and not in 1, and N in the word and not in 4. For ""sonic"": O in word not in 2; N not in 3; C not in 5; and S,I not in word.

A word that fits: for example, ""COUNT"" doesn't work.

What about ""Fount""? But no C.

""CONKY"" has C at 1 -> not allowed.

"" UNBOX"" has no C.

This is frustrating.

Let's try ""HOUND"": no C.

If we think of words with C, N, O together:

 list: con (part), but 5 letter: conic -> C at 1? -> not allowed.

  canto -> C at 1? not allowed.

  donec? not English.

  one idea: ""COVIN"" -> C at 1 -> not allowed.

  ""MOVEN"" -> no C.

  ""ON C U S"" -> but has S.

Wait, is there a word ""oncus""? Not common.

Another: ""CONDO"" -> C first? invalid.

""MOUNCE"" too long.

""PUNCH"" -> has U, P, H, but no O? required O.

We must have O in the word.

Perhaps the feedback has been misinterpreted? Let me double-check.

Guess 2: sonic -> S(x) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(-)

This means:
  O is present but not in position 2 -> so O must be in the word somewhere else.
  N is present but not in position 3.
  C is present but not in position 5.

Also from first guess: C not in 1, N not in 4.

So together, C must be in 2,3,4 and N in 1,2,5.

O must not be in 2.

Now, it's possible that the word is ""BLOCK"" but no N.

Or ""CLOCK"" -> C at 1 -> not allowed.

Perhaps ""notch"" with letters rearranged: but O cannot be in 2.

Assume the word is ""C O m b N"" -> positions: C at 1 -> invalid.

Another word: ""COMBO"" -> no N.

What about ""YOND . "" no C.

Let's try to use the letter 'T'. how about the word ""TONDO""? Let's check:

TONDO: T O N D O

Check positions:
  T at 1 -> new.
  O at 2 -> not allowed! Because O cannot be in position 2.

So invalid.

""CONED"" -> but E is allowed? E is eliminated? First guess said E(x) -> not in word.

""  C O L D N"" not.

Perhaps ""O U C H N"" not a word.

We might need to guess a word that has C, N, O and two new letters, even if it doesn't satisfy all position constraints? But we must satisfy the presence and the position constraints known.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""UNCOR"" but R is out? S,I,R,A,E are out.

R is eliminated.

 or U N C O N -> ""UNCON"" is a word? And it has U, N, C, O, N -> so five letters.

U N C O N.

Check positions:
  U at 1 -> new.
  N at 2 -> allowed? because N can be in 2 (positions 1,2,5 are allowed for N).
  C at 3 -> allowed? C can be in positions 2,3,4.
  O at 4 -> allowed? and no constraint on O's position except not 2? And 4 is fine.
  N at 5 -> allowed? But duplicate N? The feedback might handle duplicates? In 'crane', there was only one N, but in ""sonic"" one N, so maybe the secret word has two N's? And we have only been told about the N in positions 4 and 3 but not others.

But the feedback rule: if there are duplicates, it's a bit complex. In the first guess, if there is only one N in the secret word and you guess a word with one N in position 4 and it's not position 4, you get '-'. In the second guess, you guess N in position 3 and get '-', which is consistent with the secret word's N being elsewhere.

But in ""UNCON"", it has two N's. So let's see thefeedback for ""crane"" and ""sonic"":

- ""crane"" had N in position 4 and got '-', meaning that there is an N but not in position 4. It doesn't say how many. So it could be multiple.

- ""sonic"" had N in position 3 and got '-', meaning there is an N but not in position 3. This could be the same N or another.

But feedback doesn't indicate which occurrence. However, in our guesses, we only guessed one N at a time.

So secret word could have two N's.

Similarly for other letters.

But we don't have evidence for duplicates.

""UNCON"" is a valid English word? It means unconscious? But usually ""uncon"" is short for unconscious, and considered valid in some lexicons.

But let's risk it and see.

Positions: U in 1, N in 2, C in 3, O in 4, N in 5.

And it has C, N, O.

Also, U and N are new letters, avoiding the bad ones.

But U: not tested before.

So, let's try ""UNCON"".

But what about the positions:
  N in position 2: allowed (because not in 3 or 4).
  C in position 3: allowed (not in 1 or 5).
  O in position 4: allowed (no constraint except not position 2).

  U in 1 and second N in 5 are new.

So this seems possible.

But are there better words? Why not try a word without duplicates first.

Another word: ""CONKY"" -> C in 1 not allowed.

""LOTIC"" -> has I? I is eliminated.

Perhaps ""bonce"" -> B O N C E -> E is bad.

""ponce"" -> P O N C E -> E bad.

""MINCE"" -> contains I and E.

""DANCE"" -> A and E are bad.

We are running out, so let's try ""UNCON"".

But there is a more common word?

""CONUS"" has S and C in first. -> not.

Another: ""NOMIC"" -> C in 6 or if last? ""NOMIC"": N O M I C -> I is bad.

We'll go with ""UNCON"".

Or is there ""DOUCE""? ""DOUCE"" has E -> bad.

""COUTH"": C in 1.

""YOICK"" no N.

So ""UNCON"" might be our best bet.

But position of O is 4, which hasn't been tested before.

We can also consider ""OCTAN"" -> but A is bad.

Let's think anew: we haven't tested letters like T, L, U, etc.

To get more information, we might want to test more common letters.

For example, include T and U.

But with five letters that must include C, N, O, and two others, avoiding R,A,E,S,I.

 and position constraints.

Another word: ""COUNT"" is invalid.

""C O G O N"" not word.

"" B O N K C"" ->""BONKC"" not word.

 Perhaps it's ""CLOUN"" -> not.

 One more try: ""CONCH"" C first.

 Or ""OUNCE"" -> O U N C E -> contains E and has O in position 1, U in2, N in3, C in4, E in5.
 But from first guess, N cannot be in position 4? Here N is in 3: from second guess, N in position 3 got '-', so we know N is not in position 3! So if secret word is ""OUNCE"", then N is in position 3 -> not allowed by feedback.

In ""OUNCE"": position of N is 3, which is prohibited by the second guess.

So no.

Another common word: ""MONTH"" has no C.

""scion"" guess already tried and S is known bad.

Therefore, we might have to guess ""UNCON"" or find another.

I found one: ""CONIN"" -> C in first -> invalid.

"" NONCE"" has E which is bad.

After research, try ""uncoy"" -> has Y, but ""UNCOY"" might be a word? Means not coy, but rare. Also we have U, N, C, O, Y.

Positions: U in 1, N in 2, C in 3, O in 4, Y in 5.
Avoids bad letters.

Also, positions: N in 2: allowed (not 3 or 4)
 C in 3: allowed.
 O in 4: allowed (not in 2).

So ""uncoy"" is a word.

But might be obscure.

Similarly, ""UNCO"" is too short.

Another: ""DOUCH"" has E not in? D O U C H: has C and O, but no N? Required N.

So must have N.

 back to ""UNCON"".

Or How about ""BUNCO"": B U N C O -> 
   B in1, U in2, N in3, C in4, O in5.
   N is in position 3 -> we know from second guess that N is not in 3! Because in ""sonic"" N in3 got '-', meaning not in 3. 
   Here in ""BUNCO"", N is in3 -> invalid.

We can't.

Therefore, let's try ""UNCON"" despite the duplicate N.

So they guess is ""UNCON"".

### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)**  
  - C is in the secret word but not in position 1.  
  - N is in the secret word but not in position 4.  
  - R, A, E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: sonic → S(x) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(-)**  
  - O is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
  - N is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
  - C is in the secret word but not in position 5.  
  - S and I are not in the secret word.  

### Inferred Constraints:
- **Mandatory letters**: C, N, O (present in the secret word).  
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, E, S, I (absent from the secret word).  
- **Position rules for C**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 2, 3, or 4.  
- **Position rules for N**: Cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
- **Position rules for O**: Cannot be in position 2 (from feedback). Can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
- **Additional rules**: Secret word must be a valid English word. Avoids duplicates unless necessary (no feedback indication of duplicates yet).  

### Thought Process:
1. **Combined constraints**:  
   - C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
   - N must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
   - O must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (avoiding position 2).  
   - Remaining letters must not be R, A, E, S, I.  
   - Possible additional letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

2. **Exploring possible words**:  
   - Tried words like ""COUNT"" (C in pos 1, invalid), ""BUNCO"" (N in pos 3, invalid), ""OUNCE"" (N in pos 3, invalid), ""CONKY"" (C in pos 1, invalid).  
   - Considered ""UNCON"" (valid word):  
     - Positions: U(1), N(2), C(3), O(4), N(5).  
     - N at position 2 is allowed (not 3 or 4).  
     - C at position 3 is allowed (not 1 or 5).  
     - O at position 4 is allowed (not 2).  
     - Excluded letters avoided.  
     - Duplicate N is plausible (feedback doesn't rule it out).  

3. **Why ""UNCON""?**:  
   - Fits all known posición constraints for C, N, O.  
   - Tests new common letters (U) for coverage.  
   - Valid English word (archaic/abbreviation for ""unconscious"").  
   - Efficient use of guess to confirm/exclude U and potential duplicate N.

<guess>uncon</guess>",uncon,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
   This tells us:
   - C is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, A, E are not in the word.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

2. ""sonic"": S(x), O(-), N(-), I(x), C(-)
   This tells us:
   - S and I are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and got '-', meaning it is present but not there).
   - N is in the word but not in position 3 (guessed in position 3, got '-').
   - C is in the word but not in position 5 (guessed in position 5, got '-').

Now, combining the information:

Letters known to be in the word: C, N, O (because C and N were confirmed in the first guess, and O is confirmed in the second guess).

Letters known to be absent: R, A, E (from first guess), S, I (from second guess).

Positions:
- C is not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). Therefore, C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Therefore, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- O is not in position 2 (from second guess) and could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We now have the known letters: C, N, O. We know the word must contain these three letters. Since the word is 5 letters, there are two more letters we don't know yet. We must avoid R, A, E, S, I.

We have 6 tries, so we can make an educated guess that includes C in positions 2, 3, or 4; N in positions 1, 2, or 5; and O not in position 2.

Let's think of words that include C, N, O and avoid R, A, E, S, I.

Common letters that might appear: T, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

We want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down.

Also, note the positions.

For example, N cannot be in position 3 or 4, so options for N: 1, 2, 5.

C cannot be in position 1 or 5, so positions 2, 3, 4.

O can be anywhere but 2.

Let's try to build words:

Case 1: N in position 1.
   Then positions: N _ _ _ _
   C must be in 2,3,4.
   O in 3,4,5 (since not 2).

Example words with N first and avoiding forbidden letters: 
   N O T C H? But H is new. Let's check: NOTCH has O in 2? That would be position 2 for O, but O cannot be in position 2? Wait no: the feedback says O is not in position 2, but it could be elsewhere. In NOTCH: O is in position 2? We can't place O in position 2 because in ""sonic"" O was in position 2 and got '-', meaning O is not in position 2. So NOTCH: O must be placed? If N is first, and we put O in 2: that would be invalid because O cannot be in position 2.

So for N in position 1, we must avoid putting O in position 2. So O must be in 3,4,5.

Possible words:
   N _ O _ _ : Then we have C to place in 2,4,5? But wait: we must include C. Position 2 is free. So if O is in 3, then position 2 could be C? But C can be in position 2.

Example: N C O _ _? What letters? We have two more. Must avoid R,A,E,S,I. Words: NCO something? Not common: NCOMB? No, NCOLD? No.

Alternatively, N in 1, O in 4: N _ _ O _ 
  Then C could be in 2 or 3? Position 5 is possible? But C cannot be in position 5? Because of the feedback? Wait: from second guess C was in position 5 and got '-', meaning C is not in position 5. So C cannot be in position 5. Therefore, C must be in position 2 or 3.

So for N in 1 and O in 4:
  N ? ? O ?
  ? can be C in 2 or 3, but also another letter.

For example: N O C O D? Duplicate O? Probably not. Or ""NODUL"" has no C.

Not easy.

Case 2: N in position 2.
   Then: _ N _ _ _
   C must be in position 3 or 4 (since not 1,5; and position 2 is taken by N).
   O must not be in position 2 (already taken) so O in 1,3,4,5.

But position 1 could be O: then O N ? ? ?

Then if C is in position 3: O N C ? ?

Avoiding bad letters: O N C H T? ""ONCET"" isn't a word. O N C U T? ""ONCUT""? Not a word.

If O is not first, then: for example, if O is in 3: _ N O _ _ then C in 4? So _ N O C _.

Possible words: U N O C K? But U and K: ""UNOCK"" not word. T N O C H? Doesn't work.

Case 3: N in position 5.
   Then: _ _ _ _ N
   C must be in 2,3,4.
   O can be in 1,3,4 (not 2).

Example: if O is in 1: O _ _ _ N
   Then C in 2,3,4.

For example: O _ C _ N? Like ""O C E A N"" but E and A are eliminated? A and E are out.

Cannot use E or A.

Try O _ _ C N? And avoid bad letters: O T T C N? ""OTTCN"" no.

Also, we must have two more letters? Actually, we have three known letters: O, C, N. So when N is in 5 and O in 1, then positions 2 and 3 need to be filled, and C must be in one of 2,3,4? But position 4 is the only one left for C? Not exactly, position 4 is available but so are 2 and 3.

Actually, positions: 
  1: O
  5: N
  Then positions 2,3,4: two letters? No, three positions: so we need to put C and two more letters.

C can be in position 2,3, or 4.

Example: O C _ _ N: must fill positions 3 and 4. But we cannot have S,I,R,A,E. So letters like T, U, L, M, etc.

Word: OC T O N? ""OCTON"" is not a valid word? Actually, ""OCTAN"" is not allowed because A is eliminated? Also, duplicate O? We might not have duplicate.

Actually, ""OCEAN"" has A and E -> invalid.

Possible: ""OCULN""? Not a word.

Alternatively, place C in position 4: O _ _ C N -> then we have positions 2 and 3: so O ? ? C N.

Words: O M I C N? but I is invalid. O V I C N? I invalid. O L L C N? Not word.

This is difficult.

Another idea: we haven't considered the possibility of duplicate letters. But so far, we don't have any indication of duplicates.

Let's think of all common words with C, N, O without the forbidden letters.

We know that the word must contain C, N, O and two other letters from the remaining alphabet except R,A,E,S,I.

We can choose from: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And position constraints.

For example, the word ""COUNT"": 
   C O U N T -> 
   But let's check the positions: 
      C is in position 1 -> not allowed! Because from first guess, C cannot be in position 1.

Rejected.

Word ""FOCUS"": has S -> S is eliminated.

Word ""LOCUM"": no C? Wait, it has C? L O C U M -> C is in position 3? 
  But we don't know if L, U, M are allowed? But also, this word does not have N? But N is required.

So must have N.

Word ""ONION"": but I is eliminated? And also has two O's? But I is not allowed.

Word ""CONDO"": C in first? Not allowed.

Word ""MONTH"": M O N T H -> 
   Does it have C? Actually, no C -> but C is required.

We must have C.

Word ""CONCH"": C in first -> not allowed.

Word ""PINCH"": I is eliminated? And also P is new? But I is not allowed.

How about ""CLOWN"": C in first? Not allowed.

""BUNCO"": B U N C O -> 
   Positions: 
     B:1, U:2, N:3, C:4, O:5
   Check constraints:
     C is in position 4 -> allowed (since C cannot be in 1 or 5, so 4 is fine).
     N is in position 3 -> not allowed? Because from the second guess, we had N in position 3 and got '-', meaning N cannot be in position 3! Therefore, in ""BUNCO"", N is in position 3 -> invalid.

So no.

Word ""NOVICE"": 6 letters? Not enough, must be 5.

Wait, we are only looking for 5-letter words.

Another idea: ""UNCOS"" -> S is eliminated? And also O? But UNCOS is 5 letters? But S at the end -> S is eliminated.

Avoid S.

Perhaps ""DOUCN"" -> but not a word.

Let me think of words ending with N and containing C and O.

For example: _ _ _ _ N, with C in 2,3,4 and O in 1,3,4.

Example: if O is in 1 and C in 4: O _ _ C N -> as before, hard.

Place O in 4: _ _ _ O N. Then C in 2 or 3? Position 1 is available.

So: ? ? C O N -> but we don't know if that word exists? Like B A C O N -> A eliminated? A is bad.

T U C O N? Not word.

L U C O N? Not word.

What if O in 3: _ _ O _ N. Then C can be in 2 or 4? 
  If C in 4: _ _ O C N -> then positions 1,2: like T O O C N? T O O C N -> not word. Or word ""GLOBU N"" no.

Alternatively, C in position 2: _ C O _ N -> then positions 1 and 4: U C O M N? Not word. E C O L N? E is eliminated.

Perhaps we haven't considered N in position 2? 

Earlier cases were hard.

Another common word: ""CONQUER"" is too long.

Wait, what about ""COUNT"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

Perhaps ""CROON"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid and R is eliminated.

Let's try a different approach. We know the word has C, N, O. And two other letters.

We also know N cannot be in position 3 or 4, and C cannot be in 1 or 5.

Set the positions:

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

For C: positions 2,3,4
For N: positions 1,2,5
For O: any position except 2.

Let's list possible combinations for these three letters:

We can have:
- N at 1, O at 3, C at 4: then positions 2 and 5 -> N, O, C are placed: 1:N, 3:O, 4:C, so positions 2 and 5 to fill.
   Word: N ? O C ?
   Must be two new letters excluding R,A,E,S,I.

   Can we find a word: N L O C K -> ""NLOCK"" not word. 
   N O O C H -> double O? And O in 2? But O cannot be in position 2? Here O is in position 3 -> allowed. But position 2 is 'O'? In the feedback O is not in position 2, so we can put O in 3? But position 2 is a different letter: so we are putting O in 3, not 2? That's fine. But ""NOOCH"" not a word.

   Alternatively, N O L C H? Not word.

   N U O C K -> not word.

   This doesn't yield.

- Another combination: N at 1, O at 4, C at 3: of course, we already had constraint that O can be at 4? Then positions: 1:N, 3:C, 4:O, then positions 2,5: e.g. N E C O R -> filled with forbidden.

   N at 1, O at 5, C at 2: positions 1:N, 2:C (allowed?), position 5:O, then positions 3,4. 
   C is in position 2 -> allowed? Yes, because C was not tried in position 2 before? We only have C in position 1 and 5 tried and forbidden? So position 2 is new. 
   So: N C ? ? O -> must fill positions 3,4. Avoid R,A,E,S,I.
   Possible words: N C L E O -> E and A are not? E is eliminated. 
   N C U L O -> ""NCULO"" not word.
   N C T U O -> ""NCTUO"" no.

Not working.

Try N at 5. Also, O at 1 and C at 3: as we had.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""CONTO""? But C in position 1 -> invalid.

Let's extend our letter pool. Since we have to find a word, we might try a word that also tests common letters.

We know the word has C, N, O. We need to find what the other two letters are.

We can try words that include T, which is common.

For example: ""N O T C H"" -> but C in position 4 and N at 1, but the word wouldn't have O because we haven't placed O? Actually, we must have O.

Alternatively, ""C O N T H"" -> C in first -> invalid.

""T O N C H"" -> T in position 1, O in 2: but O cannot be in position 2! -> invalid.

But O is in position 2 -> cannot be because we know O is not in position 2.

So put O elsewhere.

For example: T _ O _ _ N? But that's 6 positions.

5-letter only.

Perhaps: _ _ _ _ N with O and C inside.

Let's consider the word ""YOUNG"": has no C? Not required.

We might need to consider that the secret word might contain one of the letters twice? For example, let's assume no duplicates, which is not always the case.

But from feedback, for ""sonic"", there was no duplicate feedback, so probably no duplicates.

Another word: ""NONCE"" -> but E is eliminated? ""NONCE"" has E -> invalid.

""BOUND"" -> has no C.

 let's recall the feedback for ""crane"": the C must be in the word and not in 1, and N in the word and not in 4. For ""sonic"": O in word not in 2; N not in 3; C not in 5; and S,I not in word.

A word that fits: for example, ""COUNT"" doesn't work.

What about ""Fount""? But no C.

""CONKY"" has C at 1 -> not allowed.

"" UNBOX"" has no C.

This is frustrating.

Let's try ""HOUND"": no C.

If we think of words with C, N, O together:

 list: con (part), but 5 letter: conic -> C at 1? -> not allowed.

  canto -> C at 1? not allowed.

  donec? not English.

  one idea: ""COVIN"" -> C at 1 -> not allowed.

  ""MOVEN"" -> no C.

  ""ON C U S"" -> but has S.

Wait, is there a word ""oncus""? Not common.

Another: ""CONDO"" -> C first? invalid.

""MOUNCE"" too long.

""PUNCH"" -> has U, P, H, but no O? required O.

We must have O in the word.

Perhaps the feedback has been misinterpreted? Let me double-check.

Guess 2: sonic -> S(x) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(-)

This means:
  O is present but not in position 2 -> so O must be in the word somewhere else.
  N is present but not in position 3.
  C is present but not in position 5.

Also from first guess: C not in 1, N not in 4.

So together, C must be in 2,3,4 and N in 1,2,5.

O must not be in 2.

Now, it's possible that the word is ""BLOCK"" but no N.

Or ""CLOCK"" -> C at 1 -> not allowed.

Perhaps ""notch"" with letters rearranged: but O cannot be in 2.

Assume the word is ""C O m b N"" -> positions: C at 1 -> invalid.

Another word: ""COMBO"" -> no N.

What about ""YOND . "" no C.

Let's try to use the letter 'T'. how about the word ""TONDO""? Let's check:

TONDO: T O N D O

Check positions:
  T at 1 -> new.
  O at 2 -> not allowed! Because O cannot be in position 2.

So invalid.

""CONED"" -> but E is allowed? E is eliminated? First guess said E(x) -> not in word.

""  C O L D N"" not.

Perhaps ""O U C H N"" not a word.

We might need to guess a word that has C, N, O and two new letters, even if it doesn't satisfy all position constraints? But we must satisfy the presence and the position constraints known.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""UNCOR"" but R is out? S,I,R,A,E are out.

R is eliminated.

 or U N C O N -> ""UNCON"" is a word? And it has U, N, C, O, N -> so five letters.

U N C O N.

Check positions:
  U at 1 -> new.
  N at 2 -> allowed? because N can be in 2 (positions 1,2,5 are allowed for N).
  C at 3 -> allowed? C can be in positions 2,3,4.
  O at 4 -> allowed? and no constraint on O's position except not 2? And 4 is fine.
  N at 5 -> allowed? But duplicate N? The feedback might handle duplicates? In 'crane', there was only one N, but in ""sonic"" one N, so maybe the secret word has two N's? And we have only been told about the N in positions 4 and 3 but not others.

But the feedback rule: if there are duplicates, it's a bit complex. In the first guess, if there is only one N in the secret word and you guess a word with one N in position 4 and it's not position 4, you get '-'. In the second guess, you guess N in position 3 and get '-', which is consistent with the secret word's N being elsewhere.

But in ""UNCON"", it has two N's. So let's see thefeedback for ""crane"" and ""sonic"":

- ""crane"" had N in position 4 and got '-', meaning that there is an N but not in position 4. It doesn't say how many. So it could be multiple.

- ""sonic"" had N in position 3 and got '-', meaning there is an N but not in position 3. This could be the same N or another.

But feedback doesn't indicate which occurrence. However, in our guesses, we only guessed one N at a time.

So secret word could have two N's.

Similarly for other letters.

But we don't have evidence for duplicates.

""UNCON"" is a valid English word? It means unconscious? But usually ""uncon"" is short for unconscious, and considered valid in some lexicons.

But let's risk it and see.

Positions: U in 1, N in 2, C in 3, O in 4, N in 5.

And it has C, N, O.

Also, U and N are new letters, avoiding the bad ones.

But U: not tested before.

So, let's try ""UNCON"".

But what about the positions:
  N in position 2: allowed (because not in 3 or 4).
  C in position 3: allowed (not in 1 or 5).
  O in position 4: allowed (no constraint except not position 2).

  U in 1 and second N in 5 are new.

So this seems possible.

But are there better words? Why not try a word without duplicates first.

Another word: ""CONKY"" -> C in 1 not allowed.

""LOTIC"" -> has I? I is eliminated.

Perhaps ""bonce"" -> B O N C E -> E is bad.

""ponce"" -> P O N C E -> E bad.

""MINCE"" -> contains I and E.

""DANCE"" -> A and E are bad.

We are running out, so let's try ""UNCON"".

But there is a more common word?

""CONUS"" has S and C in first. -> not.

Another: ""NOMIC"" -> C in 6 or if last? ""NOMIC"": N O M I C -> I is bad.

We'll go with ""UNCON"".

Or is there ""DOUCE""? ""DOUCE"" has E -> bad.

""COUTH"": C in 1.

""YOICK"" no N.

So ""UNCON"" might be our best bet.

But position of O is 4, which hasn't been tested before.

We can also consider ""OCTAN"" -> but A is bad.

Let's think anew: we haven't tested letters like T, L, U, etc.

To get more information, we might want to test more common letters.

For example, include T and U.

But with five letters that must include C, N, O, and two others, avoiding R,A,E,S,I.

 and position constraints.

Another word: ""COUNT"" is invalid.

""C O G O N"" not word.

"" B O N K C"" ->""BONKC"" not word.

 Perhaps it's ""CLOUN"" -> not.

 One more try: ""CONCH"" C first.

 Or ""OUNCE"" -> O U N C E -> contains E and has O in position 1, U in2, N in3, C in4, E in5.
 But from first guess, N cannot be in position 4? Here N is in 3: from second guess, N in position 3 got '-', so we know N is not in position 3! So if secret word is ""OUNCE"", then N is in position 3 -> not allowed by feedback.

In ""OUNCE"": position of N is 3, which is prohibited by the second guess.

So no.

Another common word: ""MONTH"" has no C.

""scion"" guess already tried and S is known bad.

Therefore, we might have to guess ""UNCON"" or find another.

I found one: ""CONIN"" -> C in first -> invalid.

"" NONCE"" has E which is bad.

After research, try ""uncoy"" -> has Y, but ""UNCOY"" might be a word? Means not coy, but rare. Also we have U, N, C, O, Y.

Positions: U in 1, N in 2, C in 3, O in 4, Y in 5.
Avoids bad letters.

Also, positions: N in 2: allowed (not 3 or 4)
 C in 3: allowed.
 O in 4: allowed (not in 2).

So ""uncoy"" is a word.

But might be obscure.

Similarly, ""UNCO"" is too short.

Another: ""DOUCH"" has E not in? D O U C H: has C and O, but no N? Required N.

So must have N.

 back to ""UNCON"".

Or How about ""BUNCO"": B U N C O -> 
   B in1, U in2, N in3, C in4, O in5.
   N is in position 3 -> we know from second guess that N is not in 3! Because in ""sonic"" N in3 got '-', meaning not in 3. 
   Here in ""BUNCO"", N is in3 -> invalid.

We can't.

Therefore, let's try ""UNCON"" despite the duplicate N.

So they guess is ""UNCON"".

<guess>uncon</guess>### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)**  
  - C is in the secret word but not in position 1.  
  - N is in the secret word but not in position 4.  
  - R, A, E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: sonic → S(x) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(-)**  
  - O is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
  - N is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
  - C is in the secret word but not in position 5.  
  - S and I are not in the secret word.  

### Inferred Constraints:
- **Mandatory letters**: C, N, O (present in the secret word).  
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, E, S, I (absent from the secret word).  
- **Position rules for C**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 2, 3, or 4.  
- **Position rules for N**: Cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
- **Position rules for O**: Cannot be in position 2 (from feedback). Can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
- **Additional rules**: Secret word must be a valid English word. Avoids duplicates unless necessary (no feedback indication of duplicates yet).  

### Thought Process:
1. **Combined constraints**:  
   - C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
   - N must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
   - O must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (avoiding position 2).  
   - Remaining letters must not be R, A, E, S, I.  
   - Possible additional letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

2. **Exploring possible words**:  
   - Tried words like ""COUNT"" (C in pos 1, invalid), ""BUNCO"" (N in pos 3, invalid), ""OUNCE"" (N in pos 3, invalid), ""CONKY"" (C in pos 1, invalid).  
   - Considered ""UNCON"" (valid word):  
     - Positions: U(1), N(2), C(3), O(4), N(5).  
     - N at position 2 is allowed (not 3 or 4).  
     - C at position 3 is allowed (not 1 or 5).  
     - O at position 4 is allowed (not 2).  
     - Excluded letters avoided.  
     - Duplicate N is plausible (feedback doesn't rule it out).  

3. **Why ""UNCON""?**:  
   - Fits all known posición constraints for C, N, O.  
   - Tests new common letters (U) for coverage.  
   - Valid English word (archaic/abbreviation for ""unconscious"").  
   - Efficient use of guess to confirm/exclude U and potential duplicate N.",Guess 3: uncon -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(✓) C(-) O(-) N(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,knock,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me think: we want to cover as many common letters as possible. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word. It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
  R: x (R is not in the secret word)
  A: x (A is not in the secret word)
  N: - (N is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
  E: x (E is not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback we know:
  - The secret word contains the letters C and N, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
  - The secret word does not contain R, A, or E.

We also know that the secret word is 5 letters long.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Includes C and N (since they are present in the secret word) and excludes R, A, E.
  - The letter C cannot be in the first position (because in ""crane"" it was first and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
  - The letter N cannot be in the fourth position (because in ""crane"" it was fourth and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).

We can also consider that the word might have other common letters.

Let's think of words that have C and N, and avoid R, A, E.

Common consonants: we can try to use S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

We also note that the word must have exactly 5 letters and be a valid English word.

Possible words:
  - We can try to put C in a different position (not first) and N in a different position (not fourth).

Let me think of words that have C and N, without R, A, E.

For example:
  - ""CLINT"": but we don't know if L, I, T are allowed? We haven't ruled them out. However, we must avoid R, A, E.

But let's check: 
  C is in position 1? We know C cannot be in position 1. So if we use ""CLINT"", C is in position 1 again -> not allowed.

We need to put C in a position other than 1. Similarly, N should not be in position 4.

Let me try to put C in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, N can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (but not 4).

Another idea: since we have two letters to place (C and N) and we know they are in the word, we can try a word that has C and N and three new letters.

Let me think of words that have C and N, without R, A, E.

Some words:
  - ""NICOL"": but that's 5 letters? Actually, ""NICOL"" is not common. Maybe ""COLIN""? But ""COLIN"" has C in first position? We cannot have C in first.

Wait, ""COLIN"": 
  C is first -> not allowed.

  - ""CONIC"": but that has two C's? And also O and I. Let's see: 
    C in first position -> not allowed.

  - ""CINCT"": not a word.

  - ""SCION"": 
      S, C, I, O, N -> avoids R, A, E.
      C is in second position -> okay (since we haven't tried that position for C).
      N is in fifth position -> okay (not fourth).

But we must check if the word is valid. ""SCION"" is a valid English word.

Alternatively, ""SONIC"": 
  S, O, N, I, C -> 
    C is in fifth position -> okay.
    N is in third position -> okay (not fourth).

But note: we have to avoid the letters R, A, E.

Both ""SCION"" and ""SONIC"" avoid these.

Another one: ""ONCET"" is not a word.

""INCUT"": not common.

""UNCOG"": not common.

So, let's choose between ""SCION"" and ""SONIC"". Both are valid.

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know, but the feedback didn't show any duplicates so far.

We can also consider ""CONUS"" but C is first -> not allowed.

Another word: ""MUCIN"": 
  M, U, C, I, N -> 
    C is in third position -> okay.
    N is in fifth position -> okay.

But we don't know if M, U, I are in the word? We are trying to test new letters.

We want to maximize information. We have 6 tries, so we can try to cover more common letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, etc.

In ""SCION"": we have S, C, I, O, N -> we are testing S, I, O as well.

In ""SONIC"": we have S, O, N, I, C -> same letters.

But note: the positions matter.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has C and N and also includes other common letters we haven't tested, such as T, L, etc.

For example: ""CLINT"" is invalid because C is first.

How about ""TONIC"": 
  T, O, N, I, C -> 
    C is fifth -> okay.
    N is third -> okay.

But we have O and I again.

Another: ""CUTIN"": 
  C is first -> invalid.

""UNLIT"" doesn't have C or N.

We need both C and N.

So, let's go with ""SCION"" or ""SONIC"". 

I think ""SONIC"" is a more common word? But both are acceptable.

Alternatively, we can try ""NICKS"": 
  N, I, C, K, S -> 
    N is first -> okay (we haven't had N in first, so it's allowed? The feedback only said N is in the word but not in the fourth position. It could be in first).
    C is third -> okay (not first, so allowed).
    Avoids R, A, E.

But note: we have two new letters: K and S.

However, we already know that the word has C and N, so we must include them.

I think ""SONIC"" is a good choice because:
  - It has S, O, N, I, C: all common letters.
  - We avoid R, A, E.
  - C is in the last position (which we haven't tried) and N is in the third (which is not the fourth).

So, let's guess ""SONIC"".

But wait: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? We don't know, but we'll see from feedback.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't reuse positions we haven't tested? Actually, we have to test new positions.

I think ""SONIC"" is a reasonable guess.

Therefore, I will guess ""SONIC"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is in the secret word but not in position 1 (marked as -).
- R, A, and E are not in the secret word (marked as x).
- N is in the secret word but not in position 4 (marked as -).

The new guess must:
- Include C and N (since they are in the secret word).
- Exclude R, A, and E (since they are not in the secret word).
- Avoid placing C in position 1 or N in position 4 (as per the feedback).

After considering words that fit these constraints, ""SONIC"" is a valid choice:
- It contains C (in position 5) and N (in position 3), avoiding the forbidden positions.
- It excludes R, A, and E.
- It introduces new common letters (S, O, I) to gather more information.

<guess>sonic</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: sonic -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

1. ""crane"": C(-), R(x), A(x), N(-), E(x)
   This tells us:
   - C is in the word but not in position 1.
   - R, A, E are not in the word.
   - N is in the word but not in position 4.

2. ""sonic"": S(x), O(-), N(-), I(x), C(-)
   This tells us:
   - S and I are not in the word.
   - O is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and got '-', meaning it is present but not there).
   - N is in the word but not in position 3 (guessed in position 3, got '-').
   - C is in the word but not in position 5 (guessed in position 5, got '-').

Now, combining the information:

Letters known to be in the word: C, N, O (because C and N were confirmed in the first guess, and O is confirmed in the second guess).

Letters known to be absent: R, A, E (from first guess), S, I (from second guess).

Positions:
- C is not in position 1 (from first guess) and not in position 5 (from second guess). Therefore, C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
- N is not in position 4 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Therefore, N must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- O is not in position 2 (from second guess) and could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We now have the known letters: C, N, O. We know the word must contain these three letters. Since the word is 5 letters, there are two more letters we don't know yet. We must avoid R, A, E, S, I.

We have 6 tries, so we can make an educated guess that includes C in positions 2, 3, or 4; N in positions 1, 2, or 5; and O not in position 2.

Let's think of words that include C, N, O and avoid R, A, E, S, I.

Common letters that might appear: T, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

We want to test as many new letters as possible to narrow down.

Also, note the positions.

For example, N cannot be in position 3 or 4, so options for N: 1, 2, 5.

C cannot be in position 1 or 5, so positions 2, 3, 4.

O can be anywhere but 2.

Let's try to build words:

Case 1: N in position 1.
   Then positions: N _ _ _ _
   C must be in 2,3,4.
   O in 3,4,5 (since not 2).

Example words with N first and avoiding forbidden letters: 
   N O T C H? But H is new. Let's check: NOTCH has O in 2? That would be position 2 for O, but O cannot be in position 2? Wait no: the feedback says O is not in position 2, but it could be elsewhere. In NOTCH: O is in position 2? We can't place O in position 2 because in ""sonic"" O was in position 2 and got '-', meaning O is not in position 2. So NOTCH: O must be placed? If N is first, and we put O in 2: that would be invalid because O cannot be in position 2.

So for N in position 1, we must avoid putting O in position 2. So O must be in 3,4,5.

Possible words:
   N _ O _ _ : Then we have C to place in 2,4,5? But wait: we must include C. Position 2 is free. So if O is in 3, then position 2 could be C? But C can be in position 2.

Example: N C O _ _? What letters? We have two more. Must avoid R,A,E,S,I. Words: NCO something? Not common: NCOMB? No, NCOLD? No.

Alternatively, N in 1, O in 4: N _ _ O _ 
  Then C could be in 2 or 3? Position 5 is possible? But C cannot be in position 5? Because of the feedback? Wait: from second guess C was in position 5 and got '-', meaning C is not in position 5. So C cannot be in position 5. Therefore, C must be in position 2 or 3.

So for N in 1 and O in 4:
  N ? ? O ?
  ? can be C in 2 or 3, but also another letter.

For example: N O C O D? Duplicate O? Probably not. Or ""NODUL"" has no C.

Not easy.

Case 2: N in position 2.
   Then: _ N _ _ _
   C must be in position 3 or 4 (since not 1,5; and position 2 is taken by N).
   O must not be in position 2 (already taken) so O in 1,3,4,5.

But position 1 could be O: then O N ? ? ?

Then if C is in position 3: O N C ? ?

Avoiding bad letters: O N C H T? ""ONCET"" isn't a word. O N C U T? ""ONCUT""? Not a word.

If O is not first, then: for example, if O is in 3: _ N O _ _ then C in 4? So _ N O C _.

Possible words: U N O C K? But U and K: ""UNOCK"" not word. T N O C H? Doesn't work.

Case 3: N in position 5.
   Then: _ _ _ _ N
   C must be in 2,3,4.
   O can be in 1,3,4 (not 2).

Example: if O is in 1: O _ _ _ N
   Then C in 2,3,4.

For example: O _ C _ N? Like ""O C E A N"" but E and A are eliminated? A and E are out.

Cannot use E or A.

Try O _ _ C N? And avoid bad letters: O T T C N? ""OTTCN"" no.

Also, we must have two more letters? Actually, we have three known letters: O, C, N. So when N is in 5 and O in 1, then positions 2 and 3 need to be filled, and C must be in one of 2,3,4? But position 4 is the only one left for C? Not exactly, position 4 is available but so are 2 and 3.

Actually, positions: 
  1: O
  5: N
  Then positions 2,3,4: two letters? No, three positions: so we need to put C and two more letters.

C can be in position 2,3, or 4.

Example: O C _ _ N: must fill positions 3 and 4. But we cannot have S,I,R,A,E. So letters like T, U, L, M, etc.

Word: OC T O N? ""OCTON"" is not a valid word? Actually, ""OCTAN"" is not allowed because A is eliminated? Also, duplicate O? We might not have duplicate.

Actually, ""OCEAN"" has A and E -> invalid.

Possible: ""OCULN""? Not a word.

Alternatively, place C in position 4: O _ _ C N -> then we have positions 2 and 3: so O ? ? C N.

Words: O M I C N? but I is invalid. O V I C N? I invalid. O L L C N? Not word.

This is difficult.

Another idea: we haven't considered the possibility of duplicate letters. But so far, we don't have any indication of duplicates.

Let's think of all common words with C, N, O without the forbidden letters.

We know that the word must contain C, N, O and two other letters from the remaining alphabet except R,A,E,S,I.

We can choose from: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And position constraints.

For example, the word ""COUNT"": 
   C O U N T -> 
   But let's check the positions: 
      C is in position 1 -> not allowed! Because from first guess, C cannot be in position 1.

Rejected.

Word ""FOCUS"": has S -> S is eliminated.

Word ""LOCUM"": no C? Wait, it has C? L O C U M -> C is in position 3? 
  But we don't know if L, U, M are allowed? But also, this word does not have N? But N is required.

So must have N.

Word ""ONION"": but I is eliminated? And also has two O's? But I is not allowed.

Word ""CONDO"": C in first? Not allowed.

Word ""MONTH"": M O N T H -> 
   Does it have C? Actually, no C -> but C is required.

We must have C.

Word ""CONCH"": C in first -> not allowed.

Word ""PINCH"": I is eliminated? And also P is new? But I is not allowed.

How about ""CLOWN"": C in first? Not allowed.

""BUNCO"": B U N C O -> 
   Positions: 
     B:1, U:2, N:3, C:4, O:5
   Check constraints:
     C is in position 4 -> allowed (since C cannot be in 1 or 5, so 4 is fine).
     N is in position 3 -> not allowed? Because from the second guess, we had N in position 3 and got '-', meaning N cannot be in position 3! Therefore, in ""BUNCO"", N is in position 3 -> invalid.

So no.

Word ""NOVICE"": 6 letters? Not enough, must be 5.

Wait, we are only looking for 5-letter words.

Another idea: ""UNCOS"" -> S is eliminated? And also O? But UNCOS is 5 letters? But S at the end -> S is eliminated.

Avoid S.

Perhaps ""DOUCN"" -> but not a word.

Let me think of words ending with N and containing C and O.

For example: _ _ _ _ N, with C in 2,3,4 and O in 1,3,4.

Example: if O is in 1 and C in 4: O _ _ C N -> as before, hard.

Place O in 4: _ _ _ O N. Then C in 2 or 3? Position 1 is available.

So: ? ? C O N -> but we don't know if that word exists? Like B A C O N -> A eliminated? A is bad.

T U C O N? Not word.

L U C O N? Not word.

What if O in 3: _ _ O _ N. Then C can be in 2 or 4? 
  If C in 4: _ _ O C N -> then positions 1,2: like T O O C N? T O O C N -> not word. Or word ""GLOBU N"" no.

Alternatively, C in position 2: _ C O _ N -> then positions 1 and 4: U C O M N? Not word. E C O L N? E is eliminated.

Perhaps we haven't considered N in position 2? 

Earlier cases were hard.

Another common word: ""CONQUER"" is too long.

Wait, what about ""COUNT"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.

Perhaps ""CROON"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid and R is eliminated.

Let's try a different approach. We know the word has C, N, O. And two other letters.

We also know N cannot be in position 3 or 4, and C cannot be in 1 or 5.

Set the positions:

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

For C: positions 2,3,4
For N: positions 1,2,5
For O: any position except 2.

Let's list possible combinations for these three letters:

We can have:
- N at 1, O at 3, C at 4: then positions 2 and 5 -> N, O, C are placed: 1:N, 3:O, 4:C, so positions 2 and 5 to fill.
   Word: N ? O C ?
   Must be two new letters excluding R,A,E,S,I.

   Can we find a word: N L O C K -> ""NLOCK"" not word. 
   N O O C H -> double O? And O in 2? But O cannot be in position 2? Here O is in position 3 -> allowed. But position 2 is 'O'? In the feedback O is not in position 2, so we can put O in 3? But position 2 is a different letter: so we are putting O in 3, not 2? That's fine. But ""NOOCH"" not a word.

   Alternatively, N O L C H? Not word.

   N U O C K -> not word.

   This doesn't yield.

- Another combination: N at 1, O at 4, C at 3: of course, we already had constraint that O can be at 4? Then positions: 1:N, 3:C, 4:O, then positions 2,5: e.g. N E C O R -> filled with forbidden.

   N at 1, O at 5, C at 2: positions 1:N, 2:C (allowed?), position 5:O, then positions 3,4. 
   C is in position 2 -> allowed? Yes, because C was not tried in position 2 before? We only have C in position 1 and 5 tried and forbidden? So position 2 is new. 
   So: N C ? ? O -> must fill positions 3,4. Avoid R,A,E,S,I.
   Possible words: N C L E O -> E and A are not? E is eliminated. 
   N C U L O -> ""NCULO"" not word.
   N C T U O -> ""NCTUO"" no.

Not working.

Try N at 5. Also, O at 1 and C at 3: as we had.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""CONTO""? But C in position 1 -> invalid.

Let's extend our letter pool. Since we have to find a word, we might try a word that also tests common letters.

We know the word has C, N, O. We need to find what the other two letters are.

We can try words that include T, which is common.

For example: ""N O T C H"" -> but C in position 4 and N at 1, but the word wouldn't have O because we haven't placed O? Actually, we must have O.

Alternatively, ""C O N T H"" -> C in first -> invalid.

""T O N C H"" -> T in position 1, O in 2: but O cannot be in position 2! -> invalid.

But O is in position 2 -> cannot be because we know O is not in position 2.

So put O elsewhere.

For example: T _ O _ _ N? But that's 6 positions.

5-letter only.

Perhaps: _ _ _ _ N with O and C inside.

Let's consider the word ""YOUNG"": has no C? Not required.

We might need to consider that the secret word might contain one of the letters twice? For example, let's assume no duplicates, which is not always the case.

But from feedback, for ""sonic"", there was no duplicate feedback, so probably no duplicates.

Another word: ""NONCE"" -> but E is eliminated? ""NONCE"" has E -> invalid.

""BOUND"" -> has no C.

 let's recall the feedback for ""crane"": the C must be in the word and not in 1, and N in the word and not in 4. For ""sonic"": O in word not in 2; N not in 3; C not in 5; and S,I not in word.

A word that fits: for example, ""COUNT"" doesn't work.

What about ""Fount""? But no C.

""CONKY"" has C at 1 -> not allowed.

"" UNBOX"" has no C.

This is frustrating.

Let's try ""HOUND"": no C.

If we think of words with C, N, O together:

 list: con (part), but 5 letter: conic -> C at 1? -> not allowed.

  canto -> C at 1? not allowed.

  donec? not English.

  one idea: ""COVIN"" -> C at 1 -> not allowed.

  ""MOVEN"" -> no C.

  ""ON C U S"" -> but has S.

Wait, is there a word ""oncus""? Not common.

Another: ""CONDO"" -> C first? invalid.

""MOUNCE"" too long.

""PUNCH"" -> has U, P, H, but no O? required O.

We must have O in the word.

Perhaps the feedback has been misinterpreted? Let me double-check.

Guess 2: sonic -> S(x) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(-)

This means:
  O is present but not in position 2 -> so O must be in the word somewhere else.
  N is present but not in position 3.
  C is present but not in position 5.

Also from first guess: C not in 1, N not in 4.

So together, C must be in 2,3,4 and N in 1,2,5.

O must not be in 2.

Now, it's possible that the word is ""BLOCK"" but no N.

Or ""CLOCK"" -> C at 1 -> not allowed.

Perhaps ""notch"" with letters rearranged: but O cannot be in 2.

Assume the word is ""C O m b N"" -> positions: C at 1 -> invalid.

Another word: ""COMBO"" -> no N.

What about ""YOND . "" no C.

Let's try to use the letter 'T'. how about the word ""TONDO""? Let's check:

TONDO: T O N D O

Check positions:
  T at 1 -> new.
  O at 2 -> not allowed! Because O cannot be in position 2.

So invalid.

""CONED"" -> but E is allowed? E is eliminated? First guess said E(x) -> not in word.

""  C O L D N"" not.

Perhaps ""O U C H N"" not a word.

We might need to guess a word that has C, N, O and two new letters, even if it doesn't satisfy all position constraints? But we must satisfy the presence and the position constraints known.

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""UNCOR"" but R is out? S,I,R,A,E are out.

R is eliminated.

 or U N C O N -> ""UNCON"" is a word? And it has U, N, C, O, N -> so five letters.

U N C O N.

Check positions:
  U at 1 -> new.
  N at 2 -> allowed? because N can be in 2 (positions 1,2,5 are allowed for N).
  C at 3 -> allowed? C can be in positions 2,3,4.
  O at 4 -> allowed? and no constraint on O's position except not 2? And 4 is fine.
  N at 5 -> allowed? But duplicate N? The feedback might handle duplicates? In 'crane', there was only one N, but in ""sonic"" one N, so maybe the secret word has two N's? And we have only been told about the N in positions 4 and 3 but not others.

But the feedback rule: if there are duplicates, it's a bit complex. In the first guess, if there is only one N in the secret word and you guess a word with one N in position 4 and it's not position 4, you get '-'. In the second guess, you guess N in position 3 and get '-', which is consistent with the secret word's N being elsewhere.

But in ""UNCON"", it has two N's. So let's see thefeedback for ""crane"" and ""sonic"":

- ""crane"" had N in position 4 and got '-', meaning that there is an N but not in position 4. It doesn't say how many. So it could be multiple.

- ""sonic"" had N in position 3 and got '-', meaning there is an N but not in position 3. This could be the same N or another.

But feedback doesn't indicate which occurrence. However, in our guesses, we only guessed one N at a time.

So secret word could have two N's.

Similarly for other letters.

But we don't have evidence for duplicates.

""UNCON"" is a valid English word? It means unconscious? But usually ""uncon"" is short for unconscious, and considered valid in some lexicons.

But let's risk it and see.

Positions: U in 1, N in 2, C in 3, O in 4, N in 5.

And it has C, N, O.

Also, U and N are new letters, avoiding the bad ones.

But U: not tested before.

So, let's try ""UNCON"".

But what about the positions:
  N in position 2: allowed (because not in 3 or 4).
  C in position 3: allowed (not in 1 or 5).
  O in position 4: allowed (no constraint except not position 2).

  U in 1 and second N in 5 are new.

So this seems possible.

But are there better words? Why not try a word without duplicates first.

Another word: ""CONKY"" -> C in 1 not allowed.

""LOTIC"" -> has I? I is eliminated.

Perhaps ""bonce"" -> B O N C E -> E is bad.

""ponce"" -> P O N C E -> E bad.

""MINCE"" -> contains I and E.

""DANCE"" -> A and E are bad.

We are running out, so let's try ""UNCON"".

But there is a more common word?

""CONUS"" has S and C in first. -> not.

Another: ""NOMIC"" -> C in 6 or if last? ""NOMIC"": N O M I C -> I is bad.

We'll go with ""UNCON"".

Or is there ""DOUCE""? ""DOUCE"" has E -> bad.

""COUTH"": C in 1.

""YOICK"" no N.

So ""UNCON"" might be our best bet.

But position of O is 4, which hasn't been tested before.

We can also consider ""OCTAN"" -> but A is bad.

Let's think anew: we haven't tested letters like T, L, U, etc.

To get more information, we might want to test more common letters.

For example, include T and U.

But with five letters that must include C, N, O, and two others, avoiding R,A,E,S,I.

 and position constraints.

Another word: ""COUNT"" is invalid.

""C O G O N"" not word.

"" B O N K C"" ->""BONKC"" not word.

 Perhaps it's ""CLOUN"" -> not.

 One more try: ""CONCH"" C first.

 Or ""OUNCE"" -> O U N C E -> contains E and has O in position 1, U in2, N in3, C in4, E in5.
 But from first guess, N cannot be in position 4? Here N is in 3: from second guess, N in position 3 got '-', so we know N is not in position 3! So if secret word is ""OUNCE"", then N is in position 3 -> not allowed by feedback.

In ""OUNCE"": position of N is 3, which is prohibited by the second guess.

So no.

Another common word: ""MONTH"" has no C.

""scion"" guess already tried and S is known bad.

Therefore, we might have to guess ""UNCON"" or find another.

I found one: ""CONIN"" -> C in first -> invalid.

"" NONCE"" has E which is bad.

After research, try ""uncoy"" -> has Y, but ""UNCOY"" might be a word? Means not coy, but rare. Also we have U, N, C, O, Y.

Positions: U in 1, N in 2, C in 3, O in 4, Y in 5.
Avoids bad letters.

Also, positions: N in 2: allowed (not 3 or 4)
 C in 3: allowed.
 O in 4: allowed (not in 2).

So ""uncoy"" is a word.

But might be obscure.

Similarly, ""UNCO"" is too short.

Another: ""DOUCH"" has E not in? D O U C H: has C and O, but no N? Required N.

So must have N.

 back to ""UNCON"".

Or How about ""BUNCO"": B U N C O -> 
   B in1, U in2, N in3, C in4, O in5.
   N is in position 3 -> we know from second guess that N is not in 3! Because in ""sonic"" N in3 got '-', meaning not in 3. 
   Here in ""BUNCO"", N is in3 -> invalid.

We can't.

Therefore, let's try ""UNCON"" despite the duplicate N.

So they guess is ""UNCON"".

<guess>uncon</guess>### Previous Feedback Analysis:
- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)**  
  - C is in the secret word but not in position 1.  
  - N is in the secret word but not in position 4.  
  - R, A, E are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: sonic → S(x) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(-)**  
  - O is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
  - N is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
  - C is in the secret word but not in position 5.  
  - S and I are not in the secret word.  

### Inferred Constraints:
- **Mandatory letters**: C, N, O (present in the secret word).  
- **Excluded letters**: R, A, E, S, I (absent from the secret word).  
- **Position rules for C**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from feedback). Must be in position 2, 3, or 4.  
- **Position rules for N**: Cannot be in positions 3 or 4 (from feedback). Must be in position 1, 2, or 5.  
- **Position rules for O**: Cannot be in position 2 (from feedback). Can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.  
- **Additional rules**: Secret word must be a valid English word. Avoids duplicates unless necessary (no feedback indication of duplicates yet).  

### Thought Process:
1. **Combined constraints**:  
   - C must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.  
   - N must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.  
   - O must be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (avoiding position 2).  
   - Remaining letters must not be R, A, E, S, I.  
   - Possible additional letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.  

2. **Exploring possible words**:  
   - Tried words like ""COUNT"" (C in pos 1, invalid), ""BUNCO"" (N in pos 3, invalid), ""OUNCE"" (N in pos 3, invalid), ""CONKY"" (C in pos 1, invalid).  
   - Considered ""UNCON"" (valid word):  
     - Positions: U(1), N(2), C(3), O(4), N(5).  
     - N at position 2 is allowed (not 3 or 4).  
     - C at position 3 is allowed (not 1 or 5).  
     - O at position 4 is allowed (not 2).  
     - Excluded letters avoided.  
     - Duplicate N is plausible (feedback doesn't rule it out).  

3. **Why ""UNCON""?**:  
   - Fits all known posición constraints for C, N, O.  
   - Tests new common letters (U) for coverage.  
   - Valid English word (archaic/abbreviation for ""unconscious"").  
   - Efficient use of guess to confirm/exclude U and potential duplicate N.

We might not have duplicate.\n\nActually, ""OCEAN"" has A and E -> invalid.\n\nPossible: ""OCULN""? Not a word.\n\nAlternatively, place C in position 4: O _ _ C N -> then we have positions 2 and 3: so O ? ? C N.\n\nWords: O M I C N? but I is invalid. O V I C N? I invalid. O L L C N? Not word.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nAnother idea: we haven\'t considered the possibility of duplicate letters. But so far, we don\'t have any indication of duplicates.\n\nLet\'s think of all common words with C, N, O without the forbidden letters.\n\nWe know that the word must contain C, N, O and two other letters from the remaining alphabet except R,A,E,S,I.\n\nWe can choose from: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nAnd position constraints.\n\nFor example, the word ""COUNT"": \n   C O U N T -> \n   But let\'s check the positions: \n      C is in position 1 -> not allowed! Because from first guess, C cannot be in position 1.\n\nRejected.\n\nWord ""FOCUS"": has S -> S is eliminated.\n\nWord ""LOCUM"": no C? Wait, it has C? L O C U M -> C is in position 3? \n  But we don\'t know if L, U, M are allowed? But also, this word does not have N? But N is required.\n\nSo must have N.\n\nWord ""ONION"": but I is eliminated? And also has two O\'s? But I is not allowed.\n\nWord ""CONDO"": C in first? Not allowed.\n\nWord ""MONTH"": M O N T H -> \n   Does it have C? Actually, no C -> but C is required.\n\nWe must have C.\n\nWord ""CONCH"": C in first -> not allowed.\n\nWord ""PINCH"": I is eliminated? And also P is new? But I is not allowed.\n\nHow about ""CLOWN"": C in first? Not allowed.\n\n""BUNCO"": B U N C O -> \n   Positions: \n     B:1, U:2, N:3, C:4, O:5\n   Check constraints:\n     C is in position 4 -> allowed (since C cannot be in 1 or 5, so 4 is fine).\n     N is in position 3 -> not allowed? Because from the second guess, we had N in position 3 and got \'-\', meaning N cannot be in position 3! Therefore, in ""BUNCO"", N is in position 3 -> invalid.\n\nSo no.\n\nWord ""NOVICE"": 6 letters? Not enough, must be 5.\n\nWait, we are only looking for 5-letter words.\n\nAnother idea: ""UNCOS"" -> S is eliminated? And also O? But UNCOS is 5 letters? But S at the end -> S is eliminated.\n\nAvoid S.\n\nPerhaps ""DOUCN"" -> but not a word.\n\nLet me think of words ending with N and containing C and O.\n\nFor example: _ _ _ _ N, with C in 2,3,4 and O in 1,3,4.\n\nExample: if O is in 1 and C in 4: O _ _ C N -> as before, hard.\n\nPlace O in 4: _ _ _ O N. Then C in 2 or 3? Position 1 is available.\n\nSo: ? ? C O N -> but we don\'t know if that word exists? Like B A C O N -> A eliminated? A is bad.\n\nT U C O N? Not word.\n\nL U C O N? Not word.\n\nWhat if O in 3: _ _ O _ N. Then C can be in 2 or 4? \n  If C in 4: _ _ O C N -> then positions 1,2: like T O O C N? T O O C N -> not word. Or word ""GLOBU N"" no.\n\nAlternatively, C in position 2: _ C O _ N -> then positions 1 and 4: U C O M N? Not word. E C O L N? E is eliminated.\n\nPerhaps we haven\'t considered N in position 2? \n\nEarlier cases were hard.\n\nAnother common word: ""CONQUER"" is too long.\n\nWait, what about ""COUNT"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid.\n\nPerhaps ""CROON"" -> C in position 1 -> invalid and R is eliminated.\n\nLet\'s try a different approach. We know the word has C, N, O. And two other letters.\n\nWe also know N cannot be in position 3 or 4, and C cannot be in 1 or 5.\n\nSet the positions:\n\nPositions: 1,2,3,4,5\n\nFor C: positions 2,3,4\nFor N: positions 1,2,5\nFor O: any position except 2.\n\nLet\'s list possible combinations for these three letters:\n\nWe can have:\n- N at 1, O at 3, C at 4: then positions 2 and 5 -> N, O, C are placed: 1:N, 3:O, 4:C, so positions 2 and 5 to fill.\n   Word: N ? O C ?\n   Must be two new letters excluding R,A,E,S,I.\n\n   Can we find a word: N L O C K -> ""NLOCK"" not word. \n   N O O C H -> double O? And O in 2? But O cannot be in position 2? Here O is in position 3 -> allowed. But position 2 is \'O\'? In the feedback O is not in position 2, so we can put O in 3? But position 2 is a different letter: so we are putting O in 3, not 2? That\'s fine. But ""NOOCH"" not a word.\n\n   Alternatively, N O L C H? Not word.\n\n   N U O C K -> not word.\n\n   This doesn\'t yield.\n\n- Another combination: N at 1, O at 4, C at 3: of course, we already had constraint that O can be at 4? Then positions: 1:N, 3:C, 4:O, then positions 2,5: e.g. N E C O R -> filled with forbidden.\n\n   N at 1, O at 5, C at 2: positions 1:N, 2:C (allowed?), position 5:O, then positions 3,4. \n   C is in position 2 -> allowed? Yes, because C was not tried in position 2 before? We only have C in position 1 and 5 tried and forbidden? So position 2 is new. \n   So: N C ? ? O -> must fill positions 3,4. Avoid R,A,E,S,I.\n   Possible words: N C L E O -> E and A are not? E is eliminated. \n   N C U L O -> ""NCULO"" not word.\n   N C T U O -> ""NCTUO"" no.\n\nNot working.\n\nTry N at 5. Also, O at 1 and C at 3: as we had.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word is ""CONTO""? But C in position 1 -> invalid.\n\nLet\'s extend our letter pool. Since we have to find a word, we might try a word that also tests common letters.\n\nWe know the word has C, N, O. We need to find what the other two letters are.\n\nWe can try words that include T, which is common.\n\nFor example: ""N O T C H"" -> but C in position 4 and N at 1, but the word wouldn\'t have O because we haven\'t placed O? Actually, we must have O.\n\nAlternatively, ""C O N T H"" -> C in first -> invalid.\n\n""T O N C H"" -> T in position 1, O in 2: but O cannot be in position 2! -> invalid.\n\nBut O is in position 2 -> cannot be because we know O is not in position 2.\n\nSo put O elsewhere.\n\nFor example: T _ O _ _ N? But that\'s 6 positions.\n\n5-letter only.\n\nPerhaps: _ _ _ _ N with O and C inside.\n\nLet\'s consider the word ""YOUNG"": has no C? Not required.\n\nWe might need to consider that the secret word might contain one of the letters twice? For example, let\'s assume no duplicates, which is not always the case.\n\nBut from feedback, for ""sonic"", there was no duplicate feedback, so probably no duplicates.\n\nAnother word: ""NONCE"" -> but E is eliminated? ""NONCE"" has E -> invalid.\n\n""BOUND"" -> has no C.\n\n let\'s recall the feedback for ""crane"": the C must be in the word and not in 1, and N in the word and not in 4. For ""sonic"": O in word not in 2; N not in 3; C not in 5; and S,I not in word.\n\nA word that fits: for example, ""COUNT"" doesn\'t work.\n\nWhat about ""Fount""? But no C.\n\n""CONKY"" has C at 1 -> not allowed.\n\n"" UNBOX"" has no C.\n\nThis is frustrating.\n\nLet\'s try ""HOUND"": no C.\n\nIf we think of words with C, N, O together:\n\n list: con (part), but 5 letter: conic -> C at 1? -> not allowed.\n\n  canto -> C at 1? not allowed.\n\n  donec? not English.\n\n  one idea: ""COVIN"" -> C at 1 -> not allowed.\n\n  ""MOVEN"" -> no C.\n\n  ""ON C U S"" -> but has S.\n\nWait, is there a word ""oncus""? Not common.\n\nAnother: ""CONDO"" -> C first? invalid.\n\n""MOUNCE"" too long.\n\n""PUNCH"" -> has U, P, H, but no O? required O.\n\nWe must have O in the word.\n\nPerhaps the feedback has been misinterpreted? Let me double-check.\n\nGuess 2: sonic -> S(x) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(-)\n\nThis means:\n  O is present but not in position 2 -> so O must be in the word somewhere else.\n  N is present but not in position 3.\n  C is present but not in position 5.\n\nAlso from first guess: C not in 1, N not in 4.\n\nSo together, C must be in 2,3,4 and N in 1,2,5.\n\nO must not be in 2.\n\nNow, it\'s possible that the word is ""BLOCK"" but no N.\n\nOr ""CLOCK"" -> C at 1 -> not allowed.\n\nPerhaps ""notch"" with letters rearranged: but O cannot be in 2.\n\nAssume the word is ""C O m b N"" -> positions: C at 1 -> invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""COMBO"" -> no N.\n\nWhat about ""YOND . "" no C.\n\nLet\'s try to use the letter \'T\'. how about the word ""TONDO""? Let\'s check:\n\nTONDO: T O N D O\n\nCheck positions:\n  T at 1 -> new.\n  O at 2 -> not allowed! Because O cannot be in position 2.\n\nSo invalid.\n\n""CONED"" -> but E is allowed? E is eliminated? First guess said E(x) -> not in word.\n\n""  C O L D N"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""O U C H N"" not a word.\n\nWe might need to guess a word that has C, N, O and two new letters, even if it doesn\'t satisfy all position constraints? But we must satisfy the presence and the position constraints known.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word is ""UNCOR"" but R is out? S,I,R,A,E are out.\n\nR is eliminated.\n\n or U N C O N -> ""UNCON"" is a word? And it has U, N, C, O, N -> so five letters.\n\nU N C O N.\n\nCheck positions:\n  U at 1 -> new.\n  N at 2 -> allowed? because N can be in 2 (positions 1,2,5 are allowed for N).\n  C at 3 -> allowed? C can be in positions 2,3,4.\n  O at 4 -> allowed? and no constraint on O\'s position except not 2? And 4 is fine.\n  N at 5 -> allowed? But duplicate N? The feedback might handle duplicates? In \'crane\', there was only one N, but in ""sonic"" one N, so maybe the secret word has two N\'s? And we have only been told about the N in positions 4 and 3 but not others.\n\nBut the feedback rule: if there are duplicates, it\'s a bit complex. In the first guess, if there is only one N in the secret word and you guess a word with one N in position 4 and it\'s not position 4, you get \'-\'. In the second guess, you guess N in position 3 and get \'-\', which is consistent with the secret word\'s N being elsewhere.\n\nBut in ""UNCON"", it has two N\'s. So let\'s see thefeedback for ""crane"" and ""sonic"":\n\n- ""crane"" had N in position 4 and got \'-\', meaning that there is an N but not in position 4. It doesn\'t say how many. So it could be multiple.\n\n- ""sonic"" had N in position 3 and got \'-\', meaning there is an N but not in position 3. This could be the same N or another.\n\nBut feedback doesn\'t indicate which occurrence. However, in our guesses, we only guessed one N at a time.\n\nSo secret word could have two N\'s.\n\nSimilarly for other letters.\n\nBut we don\'t have evidence for duplicates.\n\n""UNCON"" is a valid English word? It means unconscious? But usually ""uncon"" is short for unconscious, and considered valid in some lexicons.\n\nBut let\'s risk it and see.\n\nPositions: U in 1, N in 2, C in 3, O in 4, N in 5.\n\nAnd it has C, N, O.\n\nAlso, U and N are new letters, avoiding the bad ones.\n\nBut U: not tested before.\n\nSo, let\'s try ""UNCON"".\n\nBut what about the positions:\n  N in position 2: allowed (because not in 3 or 4).\n  C in position 3: allowed (not in 1 or 5).\n  O in position 4: allowed (no constraint except not position 2).\n\n  U in 1 and second N in 5 are new.\n\nSo this seems possible.\n\nBut are there better words? Why not try a word without duplicates first.\n\nAnother word: ""CONKY"" -> C in 1 not allowed.\n\n""LOTIC"" -> has I? I is eliminated.\n\nPerhaps ""bonce"" -> B O N C E -> E is bad.\n\n""ponce"" -> P O N C E -> E bad.\n\n""MINCE"" -> contains I and E.\n\n""DANCE"" -> A and E are bad.\n\nWe are running out, so let\'s try ""UNCON"".\n\nBut there is a more common word?\n\n""CONUS"" has S and C in first. -> not.\n\nAnother: ""NOMIC"" -> C in 6 or if last? ""NOMIC"": N O M I C -> I is bad.\n\nWe\'ll go with ""UNCON"".\n\nOr is there ""DOUCE""? ""DOUCE"" has E -> bad.\n\n""COUTH"": C in 1.\n\n""YOICK"" no N.\n\nSo ""UNCON"" might be our best bet.\n\nBut position of O is 4, which hasn\'t been tested before.\n\nWe can also consider ""OCTAN"" -> but A is bad.\n\nLet\'s think anew: we haven\'t tested letters like T, L, U, etc.\n\nTo get more information, we might want to test more common letters.\n\nFor example, include T and U.\n\nBut with five letters that must include C, N, O, and two others, avoiding R,A,E,S,I.\n\n and position constraints.\n\nAnother word: ""COUNT"" is invalid.\n\n""C O G O N"" not word.\n\n"" B O N K C"" ->""BONKC"" not word.\n\n Perhaps it\'s ""CLOUN"" -> not.\n\n One more try: ""CONCH"" C first.\n\n Or ""OUNCE"" -> O U N C E -> contains E and has O in position 1, U in2, N in3, C in4, E in5.\n But from first guess, N cannot be in position 4? Here N is in 3: from second guess, N in position 3 got \'-\', so we know N is not in position 3! So if secret word is ""OUNCE"", then N is in position 3 -> not allowed by feedback.\n\nIn ""OUNCE"": position of N is 3, which is prohibited by the second guess.\n\nSo no.\n\nAnother common word: ""MONTH"" has no C.\n\n""scion"" guess already tried and S is known bad.\n\nTherefore, we might have to guess ""UNCON"" or find another.\n\nI found one: ""CONIN"" -> C in first -> invalid.\n\n"" NONCE"" has E which is bad.\n\nAfter research, try ""uncoy"" -> has Y, but ""UNCOY"" might be a word? Means not coy, but rare. Also we have U, N, C, O, Y.\n\nPositions: U in 1, N in 2, C in 3, O in 4, Y in 5.\nAvoids bad letters.\n\nAlso, positions: N in 2: allowed (not 3 or 4)\n C in 3: allowed.\n O in 4: allowed (not in 2).\n\nSo ""uncoy"" is a word.\n\nBut might be obscure.\n\nSimilarly, ""UNCO"" is too short.\n\nAnother: ""DOUCH"" has E not in? D O U C H: has C and O, but no N? Required N.\n\nSo must have N.\n\n back to ""UNCON"".\n\nOr How about ""BUNCO"": B U N C O -> \n   B in1, U in2, N in3, C in4, O in5.\n   N is in position 3 -> we know from second guess that N is not in 3! Because in ""sonic"" N in3 got \'-\', meaning not in 3. \n   Here in ""BUNCO"", N is in3 -> invalid.\n\nWe can\'t.\n\nTherefore, let\'s try ""UNCON"" despite the duplicate N.\n\nSo they guess is ""UNCON"".\n\n<guess>uncon</guess>### Previous Feedback Analysis:\n- **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)**  \n  - C is in the secret word but not in position 1.  \n  - N is in the secret word but not in position 4.  \n  - R, A, E are not in the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: sonic → S(x) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(-)**  \n  - O is in the secret word but not in position 2.  \n  - N is in the secret word but not in position 3.  \n  - C is in the secret word but not in position 5.  \n  - S and I are not in the secret word.  \n\n### Inferred Constraints:\n- **Mandatory letters**: C, N, O (present in the secret word).  \n- **Excluded letters**: R, A, E, S, I (absent from the secret word).  \n- **Position rules for C**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 5 (from feedback).

We have feedback from Guess 3: ""uncon"" -> U(x) N(✓) C(-) O(-) N(-)

Breaking down the feedback for ""uncon"":
- U: x (U is not in the secret word)
- First N: ✓ (N is in the secret word and in the correct position, which is position 2)
- C: - (C is in the secret word but not in position 3)
- O: - (O is in the secret word but not in position 4)
- Second N: - (N is in the secret word but not in position 5? But note: we already have one N in position 2 that is correct. The second N in position 5 is not present? Or is it that there is only one N? Let me interpret carefully.)

Important: The feedback for the second N is ""-"", which means that the letter N is in the word but not in position 5? But wait, we already have an N in position 2 that is correct. So if the secret word has only one N, then the second N in position 5 would be marked as 'x' (absent) because there's no second N. However, it is marked as '-', which typically means the letter is present but in the wrong position. But that would imply there is a second N? However, that is inconsistent because we already have an N in position 2.

But note: the feedback rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret word has one N and you guess two, one of them might be marked as correct (if in the right position) and the other as absent (if the secret doesn't have two). But in this case, the second N is marked as '-', which is ""present but wrong position"", meaning that the secret word must have at least two N's? But that contradicts because the first N is already in the correct position.

Alternatively, the feedback system might not be accounting for duplicates in the way I think. Let me recall the standard Wordle feedback:

- For each position, independently:
  - If the letter is correct and in the right position, mark ✓.
  - If the letter is in the word but not in that position, and there is another occurrence that hasn't been accounted for, mark -.
  - Otherwise, mark x.

In ""uncon"", we have two N's. The secret word has at least one N (we know from before). The first N (position 2) is correct, so it gets ✓. For the second N (position 5): 
  - If the secret word has only one N, then the second N should be marked x (because that N is not in the word, since the one N is already used in position 2).
  - But the feedback says '-' for the second N, which means that the secret word has another N that is not in position 5? So the secret word must have at least two N's.

But wait, that would mean the secret word has two N's? However, the first N is fixed at position 2. Then the second N must be in a different position (not 5). But we also know from previous feedback that N cannot be in position 3 or 4 (from guess 2 and guess 1). The only positions left are 1 and 5? But position 5 is the one we are checking and it's marked as not there, so the second N must be in position 1? But position 1 is the first letter.

But let's check the constraints for N: from guess1, N cannot be in position 4; from guess2, N cannot be in position 3. So N can be in 1,2,5. Now we have one N in position 2 (correct). The second N must be in position 1 or 5? But the feedback for the second N (position 5) is '-', meaning that there is an N in the word but not in position 5. So if there is a second N, it must be in position 1? But then the word would start with N.

But we have feedback for the first letter of ""uncon"": U is x, so the first letter is not U and also not N? Because if the first letter were N, then in ""uncon"" the first letter is U, not N. So the first letter is not N.

Therefore, it's impossible for the secret word to have two N's? Then why is the second N marked as '-'? That would be a contradiction.

Alternatively, the feedback for the second N might be a mistake? Or perhaps I misinterpret.

Another possibility: the feedback for the second N is actually 'x'? But the user wrote ""N(-)"" for the second N? The feedback is: ""U(x) N(✓) C(-) O(-) N(-)"" so the last N is marked as '-'.

But according to standard Wordle rules, if the secret word has only one N and you guess two N's, the first occurrence (if correct) gets ✓, and the second one should be x (because there's no extra N). But here the second N is marked as '-', which is inconsistent.

Unless the secret word has two N's? But then the second N must be in a position that is not 2 and not 5. The available positions are 1,3,4. But we know N cannot be in 3 or 4 (from previous feedback). So only position 1 is left? But the first letter is U in the guess and it's x, so the first letter is not U and also not N? Because if the first letter were N, then in the guess ""uncon"" the first letter is U, which is wrong, but the N in position 2 is correct. The secret word's first letter is not N because we have no information about it yet? Actually, we don't have direct information, but if the secret word had N in position 1, then in the guess ""uncon"", the first letter U would be x (which it is) and the second letter N would be ✓ (which it is). But then the secret word would have N in position 1 and 2? That is, starting with ""NN"". But then the second N in the guess (position 5) would be: the secret word has two N's (positions 1 and 2) and we have already matched the one at position 2. The secret word has no N at position 5, so the second N in the guess (position 5) should be marked as x (because there are no more N's left to match). But it is marked as '-', which is wrong.

This is confusing. Perhaps the feedback is not following standard rules? Or I have a mistake.

Let me re-read the feedback rules from the initial instruction:

""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.""

And for duplicates: if the secret word has two of the same letter, and you guess two, then they can be marked independently. But if the secret has only one, then the second occurrence in the guess might be marked as x.

In this case, for ""uncon"":
- The first N (position 2) is ✓ -> so there is an N in position 2 in the secret.
- The second N (position 5) is marked as '-' -> this means that there is an N in the secret word that is not in position 5. But we already have one N in position 2. So if there is only one N in the secret, then the second N in the guess should be x. But it's not, it's '-', so there must be a second N in the secret word.

But then where is the second N? It cannot be in position 3 or 4 (because of previous feedback: from guess1, N not in 4; from guess2, N not in 3). And it cannot be in position 2 (already taken). So only positions 1 and 5 are left. But position 5 is marked as '-' for the second N, meaning that the secret word does have an N but not in position 5. So it must be in position 1.

But then the secret word starts with N. In the guess ""uncon"", the first letter is U, which is x (correctly, because it's not N). And the second letter is N, which is ✓ (correct). Then the secret word is N N ? ? ?.

But then the second N in the guess (position 5) is: the secret word has two N's (positions 1 and 2). We have matched the one at position 2. The secret word has no N at position 5, so the guess's position 5 (N) should be x, not '-', because there is no unmatched N left? But the feedback says '-', which would be incorrect.

This is a contradiction.

Perhaps the feedback for the second N is a mistake? Or the secret word has three N's? That seems unlikely.

Another possibility: the feedback is given per letter in the order of the guess, and for duplicates, it marks the first available occurrence. But in this case, for the second N, it might be that the secret word has only one N, so the second N should be x. But it's marked as '-', which is an error.

Given the confusion, let's assume the feedback is correct and try to interpret it as:

- U: not in the word (x)
- First N: correct position (position 2) (✓)
- C: in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- O: in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- Second N: in the word but not in position 5 (-)

This implies that the secret word has at least two N's: one in position 2, and at least one more in a different position (not 5). But the only positions left are 1 and 3,4. But 3 and 4 are forbidden for N by previous feedback. So only position 1 is possible for the second N.

But then the secret word has N in position 1 and 2? Then the word starts with ""NN"". And then the feedback for the second N in position 5: since there are two N's already matched (positions 1 and 2), and no more N's, the guess's position 5 (N) should be x, not '-'. But it's '-', so that doesn't work.

Unless the secret word has three N's? Then the second N in the guess (position 5) could be marking that there is a third N not in position 5? But that seems very rare.

Perhaps the previous feedback about N positions is for the same occurrence? But we have two different guesses.

Let's list all we know about the secret word:

- Contains C, N, O.
- Does not contain R, A, E, S, I, U (from guess3, U is x).
- N is in position 2 (from guess3, the first N is ✓).
- C is in the word but not in position 3 (from guess3, C is -).
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (from guess3, O is -).
- Additionally, from guess1: C is not in position 1, N is not in position 4.
- From guess2: N is not in position 3, C is not in position 5.

So for N: 
  - It is in position 2 (fixed).
  - It is not in position 3 or 4 (from guess2 and guess1), which is consistent.

For C:
  - Not in position 1, 3, or 5. So must be in position 4? Because positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is taken by N, so C can only be in position 4? 
    - Cannot be in 1 (guess1), not in 5 (guess2), not in 3 (guess3). And position 2 is occupied by N. So only position 4 left for C.

But from guess3, O is in the word but not in position 4. So position 4 is available for C.

So C must be in position 4.

For O:
  - Not in position 2 (guess2) and not in position 4 (guess3). So O must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Now, the secret word has:
  Position 2: N
  Position 4: C

And O is in 1, 3, or 5.

Also, the word has one more letter for position 1,3,5 (since position 2 and 4 are taken).

But we have three positions left (1,3,5) and only one more known letter (O) to place, and one unknown letter.

The secret word has five letters: we know three: C, N, O. So two more letters? But we have three positions: 1,3,5. One of them is O, and the other two are unknown letters.

But we also have the feedback for the second N in ""uncon"": it was in position 5 and marked as '-', which means that there is an N in the word but not in position 5. But we already have N in position 2, so this '-' for the second N must be a mistake? Or it means that the letter in position 5 of the guess (which is N) is present in the secret word but not in position 5. But the secret word has only one N (at position 2), so it should be marked as x. But it's marked as '-', which is inconsistent.

Unless the secret word has another N? But where? Position 1,3,5 are open, but we have constraints that N cannot be in 3 or 4 (already known) and position 2 is taken. So if there is another N, it must be in position 1 or 5. But if in position 1, then the secret word has N at 1 and 2. If in position 5, then N at 2 and 5.

But from guess3, the second N in position 5 is marked as '-', which means that there is an N not in position 5. So if there is a second N, it must be in position 1.

But then the secret word is: position 1: N, position 2: N, position 4: C, and then position 3 and 5 are O and one unknown.

But then the feedback for guess3 ""uncon"":
  Position 1: U (x) -> correct, not U.
  Position 2: N (✓) -> correct.
  Position 3: C -> but secret position 3 is not C (because C is in 4), and C is in the word (at 4), so marked as '-' -> which matches.
  Position 4: O -> secret position 4 is C, not O, and O is in the word (at 3 or 5), so marked as '-' -> matches.
  Position 5: N -> secret has N at position 1 and 2, but not at 5. And there are no more N's (only two), so it should be marked as x. But it's marked as '-', which is a problem.

So unless the secret word has three N's, it doesn't work.

Perhaps the feedback for the second N is 'x' and the user wrote '-' by mistake? Or perhaps in this game, the feedback for duplicates is different.

Given the time, let's assume that the second N should be 'x'. That would resolve the contradiction.

So let's assume that the feedback for the second N in ""uncon"" is actually 'x' (not in the word). Then:

- U: x
- First N: ✓ (position 2)
- C: - (in word, not position 3)
- O: - (in word, not position 4)
- Second N: x (not in word)

Then this means the secret word has only one N, at position 2.

Then we can proceed.

So corrected feedback for guess3: U(x) N(✓) C(-) O(-) N(x)

Then what we know:
- Secret word: positions: 2: N, 4: ? (but C must be in 4 as we deduced earlier? Let me see)

From earlier deduction for C: not in 1,3,5 (from guesses) and position 2 is taken, so must be in 4.

For O: not in 2,4, so in 1,3, or 5.

And secret word has letters: C, N, O, and two others.

Letters not in word: R,A,E,S,I,U.

So the word is: [1] [3] [5] are to be filled, with O in one of 1,3,5, and two other letters from the remaining alphabet.

Positions:
1: not U, not C (since C not in 1), not N (N is only at 2), so it's either O or a new letter.
3: not C (C is in 4), not N (N at 2), so O or new letter.
5: not C, not N, so O or new letter.

And C is in position 4.

O is in one of 1,3,5.

Now, we need to guess a word that has:
- Position 2: N
- Position 4: C
- And includes O in one of 1,3,5.
- The other two positions are new letters, not R,A,E,S,I,U.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,P,T,W,Y, etc.

For example, the word could be:

- If O in position 1: O _ _ C _
  Then positions 3 and 5: two new letters.
  Example: O P _ C T -> ""OPTCT"" not word.
  O L D C T -> ""OLDCT"" not.
  O N D C A -> but A eliminated.

- If O in position 3: _ _ O C _
  Then positions 1 and 5: new letters.
  Example: T H O C K -> ""THOCK"" not common.
  P L O C K -> ""PLOCK"" not.
  C cannot be in 1, but position 1 is open.

- If O in position 5: _ _ _ C O
  Then positions 1 and 3: new letters.
  Example: B U C C O -> but U is eliminated.
  T A C C O -> A eliminated.
  P I C C O -> I eliminated.
  So try: D E C C O -> E eliminated.
  H O C C O -> O in position 2? But position 2 is N, not O.

  So: _ _ _ C O, with position 2=N, so the word is: ? N ? C O.

  Examples: ""ONICO"" -> O in 1 and O in 5? But O in 1 is allowed, but ""ONICO"" has O in 1 and 5, and N in2, C in4. But what is position 3? ""ONICO"" is not a word.

  ""INCOG"" -> I eliminated.

  ""UNCOG"" -> U eliminated.

  ""DANCE"" -> A and E eliminated.

  ""BONGO"" -> O in position 2? But position 2 is N, not O.

  So: the word is: [1] N [3] C O.

  Position 1: not O? because O is in 5. Or could be O? But then two O's? Not necessarily.

  If position 1 is O, then ""O N ? C O"", like ""ONICO"" not word.

  If position 1 is not O, then it's a new letter, and position 3 is a new letter.

  Words: ""N C C O"" in the end? "" ? N ? C O""

  Examples: ""B N A C O"" -> A bad.
   ""T N Y C O"" -> ""TYNCO"" not word.
   ""D N H C O"" -> not.

  Perhaps ""MANGO"" -> but position 2 is A? not N.

  Another idea: the word ""CONCH"" is not.

  Perhaps ""Lynch"" -> L Y N C H: positions: L1, Y2, N3, C4, H5. But position 2 must be N, not Y. So not.

  What about ""BENCH"" -> E eliminated.

  ""HOTCH"" -> O in position 2? not N.

  I'm stuck.

  Let's list common words ending with ""NCO"": but we have "" ? N ? C O"".

  Or beginning with ""?N"": then "" ? N ? C O"".

  Words: ""UNCO"" is 4 letters.

  ""INCUR"" -> I and R eliminated.

  ""ANCON"" -> A eliminated.

  ""ENACT"" -> E and A.

  Perhaps ""CONDO"" -> C in 1 not allowed.

  Another possibility: O in position 3: so the word is [1] N O C [5]

  Then [1] and [5] are letters.

  [1] not U, not C, not N, not O (because O is in 3), so new letter.
  [5] new letter.

  Example: ""T N O C K"" -> ""TNOCK"" not word.
  ""B N O C K"" -> ""BNOCK"" not.
  ""G N O C K"" -> ""GNOCK"" not.
  ""K N O C K"" -> ""KNOCK"" -> valid word! But let's check positions:
      K in1, N in2, O in3, C in4, K in5.
  Position 2: N -> correct.
  Position 4: C -> correct.
  O in position 3 -> allowed (O not in position 2 or 4, so 3 is fine).
  Letters: K and K. But we have two K's.

  Now, check feedback for guess3: ""uncon"" -> if secret is ""KNOCK"", then:
      U vs K: x (correct)
      N: position 2: N vs N: ✓ (correct)
      C: position 3: C vs O: not C, and C is in the word at position 4, so should be '-' -> matches feedback.
      O: position 4: O vs C: not O, and O is in the word at position 3, so should be '-' -> matches.
      N: position 5: N vs K: not N, and there is only one N (at position 2), so should be 'x'. But in the feedback, it was given as '-', which is a mismatch.

  But we assumed the second N should be 'x'. In this case, for ""KNOCK"", the second N in ""uncon"" (position 5) should be 'x', but the user feedback was '-', so it doesn't match.

  So ""KNOCK"" would require the second N to be 'x', but it was given as '-', so not.

  Unless the feedback was in error.

  Given the difficulty, let's try to guess a word that fits the constraints and includes O in position 5 and two new letters.

  For example, ""DANCE"" is invalid.

  ""PONCHO"" is 6 letters.

  ""CONGA"" -> C in 1.

  ""Mango"" -> position 2 is A.

  ""PINTO"" -> I eliminated.

  ""MONTH"" -> no C.

  ""HITCH"" -> no N.

  ""BATCH"" -> no N.

  ""NOTCH"" -> position 2 is O, but must be N.

  ""NICHE"" -> I and E.

  Let's try ""YOND. not.

  Perhaps ""CON In something.

  I think we have to go with the initial ""KNOCK"" and assume the feedback for the second N was meant to be 'x'. Or choose a different word.

  Another word: ""DONCO"" -> D O N C O: but position 2 is O, must be N.

  ""N  O  C  K  ?"" not.

  Try ""BUNCO"" -> B U N C O: position 2 is U, must be N.

  ""CONK"" not 5 letters.

  ""CONKY"" -> C in 1.

  ""COHOG"" -> C in 1.

  ""HONK"" not 5.

  ""HONKY"" -> H O N K Y: positions: H1, O2, N3, K4, Y5.
  But we need position 2 to be N, not O. And position 4 to be C, not K.

  So not.

  Perhaps the word is ""CIVIC"" but I eliminated.

  Let's give up and guess ""KNOCK"" as it fits except for the second N feedback.

  Or ""BLOCK"" -> B L O C K: position 2 is L, not N.

  ""CLOCK"" -> C in 1.

  ""FLOCK"" -> F L O C K: position 2 is L, not N.

  ""KNACK"" -> K N A C K: A eliminated.

  ""K N I C K"" -> I eliminated.

  ""K N O C K"" -> as before.

  So ""KNOCK"" is the only possibility I see.

  Therefore, I will guess ""KNOCK"".

  But let's note: in ""KNOCK"", the O is in position 3, which is allowed.

  And for the second N in ""uncon"", it should be 'x', but the feedback said '-', so it might be wrong, or the secret word has a duplicate K or something else.

  Perhaps the secret word is ""KNACK"", but A is eliminated.

  Or ""KNOLL"" -> no C.

  So I think ""KNOCK"" is worth a try.

  Guess: ""KNOCK""

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

1. **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)**  
   - C and N are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 4, respectively.  
   - R, A, E are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: sonic → S(x) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(-)**  
   - O is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
   - N is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
   - C is in the secret word but not in position 5.  
   - S and I are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: uncon → U(x) N(✓) C(-) O(-) N(-)**  
   - U is absent.  
   - **N is correct and in position 2** (confirmed).  
   - C is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
   - O is in the secret word but not in position 4.  
   - The second N (position 5) is marked as ""present but wrong position"" (indicating a potential duplicate N, though this is rare).  

### Key Constraints
- **Mandatory letters**: C, N, O (confirmed present).  
- **Confirmed position**: Position 2 is N.  
- **C constraints**: Cannot be in positions 1 (from Guess 1), 3 (from Guess 3), or 5 (from Guess 2). Thus, C must be in position 4.  
- **O constraints**: Cannot be in position 2 (Guess 2) or 4 (Guess 3). Thus, O must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- **Absent letters**: R, A, E, S, I, U.  
- **Duplicate N?**: The feedback for the second N in ""uncon"" (position 5) is ""-"", suggesting the secret word may have a second N, but this conflicts with position constraints (N cannot be in positions 3 or 4, and position 2 is already occupied). Given the rarity of duplicates, we prioritize the stronger constraints.  

### Deduced Word Structure
- Position 2: **N** (fixed).  
- Position 4: **C** (deduced from constraints).  
- O must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- Remaining positions (1, 3, 5) must include O and one new letter (since C, N, O account for three letters, and two more are needed).  
- Valid letters: Any except R, A, E, S, I, U. Common options: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, Y.  

### Why ""KNOCK""?
- **Structure**: K N O C K  
  - Position 2: N (✓).  
  - Position 4: C (✓).  
  - O is in position 3 (allowed, as O cannot be in 2 or 4).  
- **Fits constraints**:  
  - Avoids R, A, E, S, I, U.  
  - Tests new common letters (K) and accounts for potential duplicate K (though not confirmed).  
- **Word validity**: ""KNOCK"" is a valid English word.  
- **Feedback alignment**:  
  - In ""uncon"", the second N (position 5) was marked ""-"", which may indicate an error or rare duplicate, but ""KNOCK"" resolves this by placing O in position 3 and C in position 4.  

<guess>knock</guess>",knock,"We have feedback from Guess 3: ""uncon"" -> U(x) N(✓) C(-) O(-) N(-)

Breaking down the feedback for ""uncon"":
- U: x (U is not in the secret word)
- First N: ✓ (N is in the secret word and in the correct position, which is position 2)
- C: - (C is in the secret word but not in position 3)
- O: - (O is in the secret word but not in position 4)
- Second N: - (N is in the secret word but not in position 5? But note: we already have one N in position 2 that is correct. The second N in position 5 is not present? Or is it that there is only one N? Let me interpret carefully.)

Important: The feedback for the second N is ""-"", which means that the letter N is in the word but not in position 5? But wait, we already have an N in position 2 that is correct. So if the secret word has only one N, then the second N in position 5 would be marked as 'x' (absent) because there's no second N. However, it is marked as '-', which typically means the letter is present but in the wrong position. But that would imply there is a second N? However, that is inconsistent because we already have an N in position 2.

But note: the feedback rules: for duplicate letters, if the secret word has one N and you guess two, one of them might be marked as correct (if in the right position) and the other as absent (if the secret doesn't have two). But in this case, the second N is marked as '-', which is ""present but wrong position"", meaning that the secret word must have at least two N's? But that contradicts because the first N is already in the correct position.

Alternatively, the feedback system might not be accounting for duplicates in the way I think. Let me recall the standard Wordle feedback:

- For each position, independently:
  - If the letter is correct and in the right position, mark ✓.
  - If the letter is in the word but not in that position, and there is another occurrence that hasn't been accounted for, mark -.
  - Otherwise, mark x.

In ""uncon"", we have two N's. The secret word has at least one N (we know from before). The first N (position 2) is correct, so it gets ✓. For the second N (position 5): 
  - If the secret word has only one N, then the second N should be marked x (because that N is not in the word, since the one N is already used in position 2).
  - But the feedback says '-' for the second N, which means that the secret word has another N that is not in position 5? So the secret word must have at least two N's.

But wait, that would mean the secret word has two N's? However, the first N is fixed at position 2. Then the second N must be in a different position (not 5). But we also know from previous feedback that N cannot be in position 3 or 4 (from guess 2 and guess 1). The only positions left are 1 and 5? But position 5 is the one we are checking and it's marked as not there, so the second N must be in position 1? But position 1 is the first letter.

But let's check the constraints for N: from guess1, N cannot be in position 4; from guess2, N cannot be in position 3. So N can be in 1,2,5. Now we have one N in position 2 (correct). The second N must be in position 1 or 5? But the feedback for the second N (position 5) is '-', meaning that there is an N in the word but not in position 5. So if there is a second N, it must be in position 1? But then the word would start with N.

But we have feedback for the first letter of ""uncon"": U is x, so the first letter is not U and also not N? Because if the first letter were N, then in ""uncon"" the first letter is U, not N. So the first letter is not N.

Therefore, it's impossible for the secret word to have two N's? Then why is the second N marked as '-'? That would be a contradiction.

Alternatively, the feedback for the second N might be a mistake? Or perhaps I misinterpret.

Another possibility: the feedback for the second N is actually 'x'? But the user wrote ""N(-)"" for the second N? The feedback is: ""U(x) N(✓) C(-) O(-) N(-)"" so the last N is marked as '-'.

But according to standard Wordle rules, if the secret word has only one N and you guess two N's, the first occurrence (if correct) gets ✓, and the second one should be x (because there's no extra N). But here the second N is marked as '-', which is inconsistent.

Unless the secret word has two N's? But then the second N must be in a position that is not 2 and not 5. The available positions are 1,3,4. But we know N cannot be in 3 or 4 (from previous feedback). So only position 1 is left? But the first letter is U in the guess and it's x, so the first letter is not U and also not N? Because if the first letter were N, then in the guess ""uncon"" the first letter is U, which is wrong, but the N in position 2 is correct. The secret word's first letter is not N because we have no information about it yet? Actually, we don't have direct information, but if the secret word had N in position 1, then in the guess ""uncon"", the first letter U would be x (which it is) and the second letter N would be ✓ (which it is). But then the secret word would have N in position 1 and 2? That is, starting with ""NN"". But then the second N in the guess (position 5) would be: the secret word has two N's (positions 1 and 2) and we have already matched the one at position 2. The secret word has no N at position 5, so the second N in the guess (position 5) should be marked as x (because there are no more N's left to match). But it is marked as '-', which is wrong.

This is confusing. Perhaps the feedback is not following standard rules? Or I have a mistake.

Let me re-read the feedback rules from the initial instruction:

""Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.""

And for duplicates: if the secret word has two of the same letter, and you guess two, then they can be marked independently. But if the secret has only one, then the second occurrence in the guess might be marked as x.

In this case, for ""uncon"":
- The first N (position 2) is ✓ -> so there is an N in position 2 in the secret.
- The second N (position 5) is marked as '-' -> this means that there is an N in the secret word that is not in position 5. But we already have one N in position 2. So if there is only one N in the secret, then the second N in the guess should be x. But it's not, it's '-', so there must be a second N in the secret word.

But then where is the second N? It cannot be in position 3 or 4 (because of previous feedback: from guess1, N not in 4; from guess2, N not in 3). And it cannot be in position 2 (already taken). So only positions 1 and 5 are left. But position 5 is marked as '-' for the second N, meaning that the secret word does have an N but not in position 5. So it must be in position 1.

But then the secret word starts with N. In the guess ""uncon"", the first letter is U, which is x (correctly, because it's not N). And the second letter is N, which is ✓ (correct). Then the secret word is N N ? ? ?.

But then the second N in the guess (position 5) is: the secret word has two N's (positions 1 and 2). We have matched the one at position 2. The secret word has no N at position 5, so the guess's position 5 (N) should be x, not '-', because there is no unmatched N left? But the feedback says '-', which would be incorrect.

This is a contradiction.

Perhaps the feedback for the second N is a mistake? Or the secret word has three N's? That seems unlikely.

Another possibility: the feedback is given per letter in the order of the guess, and for duplicates, it marks the first available occurrence. But in this case, for the second N, it might be that the secret word has only one N, so the second N should be x. But it's marked as '-', which is an error.

Given the confusion, let's assume the feedback is correct and try to interpret it as:

- U: not in the word (x)
- First N: correct position (position 2) (✓)
- C: in the word but not in position 3 (-)
- O: in the word but not in position 4 (-)
- Second N: in the word but not in position 5 (-)

This implies that the secret word has at least two N's: one in position 2, and at least one more in a different position (not 5). But the only positions left are 1 and 3,4. But 3 and 4 are forbidden for N by previous feedback. So only position 1 is possible for the second N.

But then the secret word has N in position 1 and 2? Then the word starts with ""NN"". And then the feedback for the second N in position 5: since there are two N's already matched (positions 1 and 2), and no more N's, the guess's position 5 (N) should be x, not '-'. But it's '-', so that doesn't work.

Unless the secret word has three N's? Then the second N in the guess (position 5) could be marking that there is a third N not in position 5? But that seems very rare.

Perhaps the previous feedback about N positions is for the same occurrence? But we have two different guesses.

Let's list all we know about the secret word:

- Contains C, N, O.
- Does not contain R, A, E, S, I, U (from guess3, U is x).
- N is in position 2 (from guess3, the first N is ✓).
- C is in the word but not in position 3 (from guess3, C is -).
- O is in the word but not in position 4 (from guess3, O is -).
- Additionally, from guess1: C is not in position 1, N is not in position 4.
- From guess2: N is not in position 3, C is not in position 5.

So for N: 
  - It is in position 2 (fixed).
  - It is not in position 3 or 4 (from guess2 and guess1), which is consistent.

For C:
  - Not in position 1, 3, or 5. So must be in position 4? Because positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is taken by N, so C can only be in position 4? 
    - Cannot be in 1 (guess1), not in 5 (guess2), not in 3 (guess3). And position 2 is occupied by N. So only position 4 left for C.

But from guess3, O is in the word but not in position 4. So position 4 is available for C.

So C must be in position 4.

For O:
  - Not in position 2 (guess2) and not in position 4 (guess3). So O must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Now, the secret word has:
  Position 2: N
  Position 4: C

And O is in 1, 3, or 5.

Also, the word has one more letter for position 1,3,5 (since position 2 and 4 are taken).

But we have three positions left (1,3,5) and only one more known letter (O) to place, and one unknown letter.

The secret word has five letters: we know three: C, N, O. So two more letters? But we have three positions: 1,3,5. One of them is O, and the other two are unknown letters.

But we also have the feedback for the second N in ""uncon"": it was in position 5 and marked as '-', which means that there is an N in the word but not in position 5. But we already have N in position 2, so this '-' for the second N must be a mistake? Or it means that the letter in position 5 of the guess (which is N) is present in the secret word but not in position 5. But the secret word has only one N (at position 2), so it should be marked as x. But it's marked as '-', which is inconsistent.

Unless the secret word has another N? But where? Position 1,3,5 are open, but we have constraints that N cannot be in 3 or 4 (already known) and position 2 is taken. So if there is another N, it must be in position 1 or 5. But if in position 1, then the secret word has N at 1 and 2. If in position 5, then N at 2 and 5.

But from guess3, the second N in position 5 is marked as '-', which means that there is an N not in position 5. So if there is a second N, it must be in position 1.

But then the secret word is: position 1: N, position 2: N, position 4: C, and then position 3 and 5 are O and one unknown.

But then the feedback for guess3 ""uncon"":
  Position 1: U (x) -> correct, not U.
  Position 2: N (✓) -> correct.
  Position 3: C -> but secret position 3 is not C (because C is in 4), and C is in the word (at 4), so marked as '-' -> which matches.
  Position 4: O -> secret position 4 is C, not O, and O is in the word (at 3 or 5), so marked as '-' -> matches.
  Position 5: N -> secret has N at position 1 and 2, but not at 5. And there are no more N's (only two), so it should be marked as x. But it's marked as '-', which is a problem.

So unless the secret word has three N's, it doesn't work.

Perhaps the feedback for the second N is 'x' and the user wrote '-' by mistake? Or perhaps in this game, the feedback for duplicates is different.

Given the time, let's assume that the second N should be 'x'. That would resolve the contradiction.

So let's assume that the feedback for the second N in ""uncon"" is actually 'x' (not in the word). Then:

- U: x
- First N: ✓ (position 2)
- C: - (in word, not position 3)
- O: - (in word, not position 4)
- Second N: x (not in word)

Then this means the secret word has only one N, at position 2.

Then we can proceed.

So corrected feedback for guess3: U(x) N(✓) C(-) O(-) N(x)

Then what we know:
- Secret word: positions: 2: N, 4: ? (but C must be in 4 as we deduced earlier? Let me see)

From earlier deduction for C: not in 1,3,5 (from guesses) and position 2 is taken, so must be in 4.

For O: not in 2,4, so in 1,3, or 5.

And secret word has letters: C, N, O, and two others.

Letters not in word: R,A,E,S,I,U.

So the word is: [1] [3] [5] are to be filled, with O in one of 1,3,5, and two other letters from the remaining alphabet.

Positions:
1: not U, not C (since C not in 1), not N (N is only at 2), so it's either O or a new letter.
3: not C (C is in 4), not N (N at 2), so O or new letter.
5: not C, not N, so O or new letter.

And C is in position 4.

O is in one of 1,3,5.

Now, we need to guess a word that has:
- Position 2: N
- Position 4: C
- And includes O in one of 1,3,5.
- The other two positions are new letters, not R,A,E,S,I,U.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,P,T,W,Y, etc.

For example, the word could be:

- If O in position 1: O _ _ C _
  Then positions 3 and 5: two new letters.
  Example: O P _ C T -> ""OPTCT"" not word.
  O L D C T -> ""OLDCT"" not.
  O N D C A -> but A eliminated.

- If O in position 3: _ _ O C _
  Then positions 1 and 5: new letters.
  Example: T H O C K -> ""THOCK"" not common.
  P L O C K -> ""PLOCK"" not.
  C cannot be in 1, but position 1 is open.

- If O in position 5: _ _ _ C O
  Then positions 1 and 3: new letters.
  Example: B U C C O -> but U is eliminated.
  T A C C O -> A eliminated.
  P I C C O -> I eliminated.
  So try: D E C C O -> E eliminated.
  H O C C O -> O in position 2? But position 2 is N, not O.

  So: _ _ _ C O, with position 2=N, so the word is: ? N ? C O.

  Examples: ""ONICO"" -> O in 1 and O in 5? But O in 1 is allowed, but ""ONICO"" has O in 1 and 5, and N in2, C in4. But what is position 3? ""ONICO"" is not a word.

  ""INCOG"" -> I eliminated.

  ""UNCOG"" -> U eliminated.

  ""DANCE"" -> A and E eliminated.

  ""BONGO"" -> O in position 2? But position 2 is N, not O.

  So: the word is: [1] N [3] C O.

  Position 1: not O? because O is in 5. Or could be O? But then two O's? Not necessarily.

  If position 1 is O, then ""O N ? C O"", like ""ONICO"" not word.

  If position 1 is not O, then it's a new letter, and position 3 is a new letter.

  Words: ""N C C O"" in the end? "" ? N ? C O""

  Examples: ""B N A C O"" -> A bad.
   ""T N Y C O"" -> ""TYNCO"" not word.
   ""D N H C O"" -> not.

  Perhaps ""MANGO"" -> but position 2 is A? not N.

  Another idea: the word ""CONCH"" is not.

  Perhaps ""Lynch"" -> L Y N C H: positions: L1, Y2, N3, C4, H5. But position 2 must be N, not Y. So not.

  What about ""BENCH"" -> E eliminated.

  ""HOTCH"" -> O in position 2? not N.

  I'm stuck.

  Let's list common words ending with ""NCO"": but we have "" ? N ? C O"".

  Or beginning with ""?N"": then "" ? N ? C O"".

  Words: ""UNCO"" is 4 letters.

  ""INCUR"" -> I and R eliminated.

  ""ANCON"" -> A eliminated.

  ""ENACT"" -> E and A.

  Perhaps ""CONDO"" -> C in 1 not allowed.

  Another possibility: O in position 3: so the word is [1] N O C [5]

  Then [1] and [5] are letters.

  [1] not U, not C, not N, not O (because O is in 3), so new letter.
  [5] new letter.

  Example: ""T N O C K"" -> ""TNOCK"" not word.
  ""B N O C K"" -> ""BNOCK"" not.
  ""G N O C K"" -> ""GNOCK"" not.
  ""K N O C K"" -> ""KNOCK"" -> valid word! But let's check positions:
      K in1, N in2, O in3, C in4, K in5.
  Position 2: N -> correct.
  Position 4: C -> correct.
  O in position 3 -> allowed (O not in position 2 or 4, so 3 is fine).
  Letters: K and K. But we have two K's.

  Now, check feedback for guess3: ""uncon"" -> if secret is ""KNOCK"", then:
      U vs K: x (correct)
      N: position 2: N vs N: ✓ (correct)
      C: position 3: C vs O: not C, and C is in the word at position 4, so should be '-' -> matches feedback.
      O: position 4: O vs C: not O, and O is in the word at position 3, so should be '-' -> matches.
      N: position 5: N vs K: not N, and there is only one N (at position 2), so should be 'x'. But in the feedback, it was given as '-', which is a mismatch.

  But we assumed the second N should be 'x'. In this case, for ""KNOCK"", the second N in ""uncon"" (position 5) should be 'x', but the user feedback was '-', so it doesn't match.

  So ""KNOCK"" would require the second N to be 'x', but it was given as '-', so not.

  Unless the feedback was in error.

  Given the difficulty, let's try to guess a word that fits the constraints and includes O in position 5 and two new letters.

  For example, ""DANCE"" is invalid.

  ""PONCHO"" is 6 letters.

  ""CONGA"" -> C in 1.

  ""Mango"" -> position 2 is A.

  ""PINTO"" -> I eliminated.

  ""MONTH"" -> no C.

  ""HITCH"" -> no N.

  ""BATCH"" -> no N.

  ""NOTCH"" -> position 2 is O, but must be N.

  ""NICHE"" -> I and E.

  Let's try ""YOND. not.

  Perhaps ""CON In something.

  I think we have to go with the initial ""KNOCK"" and assume the feedback for the second N was meant to be 'x'. Or choose a different word.

  Another word: ""DONCO"" -> D O N C O: but position 2 is O, must be N.

  ""N  O  C  K  ?"" not.

  Try ""BUNCO"" -> B U N C O: position 2 is U, must be N.

  ""CONK"" not 5 letters.

  ""CONKY"" -> C in 1.

  ""COHOG"" -> C in 1.

  ""HONK"" not 5.

  ""HONKY"" -> H O N K Y: positions: H1, O2, N3, K4, Y5.
  But we need position 2 to be N, not O. And position 4 to be C, not K.

  So not.

  Perhaps the word is ""CIVIC"" but I eliminated.

  Let's give up and guess ""KNOCK"" as it fits except for the second N feedback.

  Or ""BLOCK"" -> B L O C K: position 2 is L, not N.

  ""CLOCK"" -> C in 1.

  ""FLOCK"" -> F L O C K: position 2 is L, not N.

  ""KNACK"" -> K N A C K: A eliminated.

  ""K N I C K"" -> I eliminated.

  ""K N O C K"" -> as before.

  So ""KNOCK"" is the only possibility I see.

  Therefore, I will guess ""KNOCK"".

  But let's note: in ""KNOCK"", the O is in position 3, which is allowed.

  And for the second N in ""uncon"", it should be 'x', but the feedback said '-', so it might be wrong, or the secret word has a duplicate K or something else.

  Perhaps the secret word is ""KNACK"", but A is eliminated.

  Or ""KNOLL"" -> no C.

  So I think ""KNOCK"" is worth a try.

  Guess: ""KNOCK""

  Format: <guess>knock</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

1. **Guess 1: crane → C(-) R(x) A(x) N(-) E(x)**  
   - C and N are in the secret word but not in positions 1 or 4, respectively.  
   - R, A, E are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: sonic → S(x) O(-) N(-) I(x) C(-)**  
   - O is in the secret word but not in position 2.  
   - N is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
   - C is in the secret word but not in position 5.  
   - S and I are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: uncon → U(x) N(✓) C(-) O(-) N(-)**  
   - U is absent.  
   - **N is correct and in position 2** (confirmed).  
   - C is in the secret word but not in position 3.  
   - O is in the secret word but not in position 4.  
   - The second N (position 5) is marked as ""present but wrong position"" (indicating a potential duplicate N, though this is rare).  

### Key Constraints
- **Mandatory letters**: C, N, O (confirmed present).  
- **Confirmed position**: Position 2 is N.  
- **C constraints**: Cannot be in positions 1 (from Guess 1), 3 (from Guess 3), or 5 (from Guess 2). Thus, C must be in position 4.  
- **O constraints**: Cannot be in position 2 (Guess 2) or 4 (Guess 3). Thus, O must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- **Absent letters**: R, A, E, S, I, U.  
- **Duplicate N?**: The feedback for the second N in ""uncon"" (position 5) is ""-"", suggesting the secret word may have a second N, but this conflicts with position constraints (N cannot be in positions 3 or 4, and position 2 is already occupied). Given the rarity of duplicates, we prioritize the stronger constraints.  

### Deduced Word Structure
- Position 2: **N** (fixed).  
- Position 4: **C** (deduced from constraints).  
- O must be in position 1, 3, or 5.  
- Remaining positions (1, 3, 5) must include O and one new letter (since C, N, O account for three letters, and two more are needed).  
- Valid letters: Any except R, A, E, S, I, U. Common options: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, T, Y.  

### Why ""KNOCK""?
- **Structure**: K N O C K  
  - Position 2: N (✓).  
  - Position 4: C (✓).  
  - O is in position 3 (allowed, as O cannot be in 2 or 4).  
- **Fits constraints**:  
  - Avoids R, A, E, S, I, U.  
  - Tests new common letters (K) and accounts for potential duplicate K (though not confirmed).  
- **Word validity**: ""KNOCK"" is a valid English word.  
- **Feedback alignment**:  
  - In ""uncon"", the second N (position 5) was marked ""-"", which may indicate an error or rare duplicate, but ""KNOCK"" resolves this by placing O in position 3 and C in position 4.",Guess 4: knock -> FEEDBACK: K(✓) N(✓) O(✓) C(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
