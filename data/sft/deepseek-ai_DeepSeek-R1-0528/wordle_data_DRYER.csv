 Since the first guess is arbitrary, it's best to choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information gained.
 Common vowels and consonants in English are good to include. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"" are often used as starters.

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- R is in the secret word and is in the correct position (position 2, since positions are 1-indexed: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5).
- E is in the secret word but not in the correct position (so E is present somewhere else).
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position.
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the fifth position (because E was guessed in position 5 and got a ""-"", meaning it's misplaced).
- The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

For our next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word that includes E (since E is in the secret word) and excludes C, A, N.
- Must have R in the second position.
- The letter E must appear, but not in the fifth position (so it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4).

We also want to try to cover other common letters to gather more information.

Possible strategy:
- We can try to include other vowels or common consonants that haven't been tested yet. We know A is not present, but there are other vowels: O, I, U (but A is out). We also have consonants left to try.

Since E must be in the word but not at the end, let's think of words with R in the second position and E in either position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's list some options:

Option: E in position 1 - so pattern: _ R _ _ _
For example: ERGOT, ERODE, etc. But we cannot use O because position 3? Wait, we don't know about O yet.

But note: We haven't ruled out O, I, U, or many other letters.

We should also avoid repeating letters we know are not present: C, A, N.

Since E is misplaced and was in position 5 originally, we can try putting E in a different position.

Possible positions for E: 1, 3, or 4.

Let me try to think of words that have R in the second position and contain E.

Also, to get more information, we can try a word with new common letters.

Common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

For example:
- Position 1: E -> EREST? Not a word. How about ""E"" at start: E in position 1 -> words like EGRET, ECLAT? ECLAT has A and we know A is not present. Oops.

We must avoid A.

Another idea: Since we know E is in the word, let's put E in position 1:

Examples:
- ERIST (not common, but ""ERASE"" has A which is absent) -> avoid A and N and C.
- Better: ""ERODE"" - has O and D? But O hasn't been tested.

ERODE: 
- Position: E (1), R (2), O (3), D (4), E (5) -> but we have two E's? Actually, the word is E-R-O-D-E? Wait, no, ERODE is E-R-O-D-E? It's 5 letters: E R O D E? Actually, ""ERODE"" is spelled E-R-O-D-E? Wait, that's 5 letters? E, R, O, D, E. But we have E repeated? But the secret word might have repeated letters? The rules don't say it can't, but typically Wordle allows repeats? But in our feedback, if there are repeats, the feedback can be tricky. However, let's avoid repeats for now if possible.

But E is only known to appear once? We don't know if it appears twice.

Better: Use a word without repeating E for now to avoid ambiguity.

So avoid repeating E in the guess? Not necessary, but for simplicity.

Another word: ""BERYL"" - but we don't know about B and Y and L? And R is in position 2? B-E-R-Y-L: position 2 is E? But we need R in position 2.

We need R in the second character.

Pattern: ? R ? ? ?

With E in one of: position 1, 3, 4.

Let me list:

Position 1: E -> E R ? ? ?
Then the word must not contain A, C, N, and E must not be in position 5? But we are putting E in position 1, so that's fine.

Examples: 
- ERECT (has C? We know C is not present) -> invalid.
- ERGOT: E R G O T -> letters: E, R, G, O, T. No C, A, N. So valid?
- EROSE: E R O S E -> has two E's? But O and S are new.

Position 3: E -> ? R E ? ?
Examples: 
- TREND: T R E N D -> but N is present? We know N is not in the secret word? Feedback from first guess says N(x). So N is not present -> cannot use TREND.
- BREED: B R E E D -> two E's? and D? Also, no N, C, A.
- CREME? But C is invalid.

Position 4: E -> ? R ? E ?
Examples: 
- BRIEF: B R I E F -> has I, E, F? But no A, C, N? OK.
- GRIEF: same thing.

But note, we also want to test more common letters.

I think ""BERET"" but that has E in position 1 and 4? B E R E T? Position 2 is E? Not R.

No, we need R exactly in position 2.

Another idea: Use a word with E and also S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Goal: Cover S, T, O, I to see if they are in the word.

Let's think of: ""PRESET""? Too many letters? Must be 5-letter.

""PRESS"": P R E S S? That's only 4 unique letters? And S repeated.

But ""PRESS"" has R in position 2 and E in position 3.

PRESS: letters P, R, E, S, S. We avoid A, C, N.

Similarly, ""TRESS"": T R E S S -> T, R, E, S.

That could work: T R E S S? Wait that has two S's.

But it's valid? Yes.

Alternatively, ""BRISK"" - but we don't know if B or S or K is present.

But let's consider: Since E must be somewhere between positions 1-4 excluding position 5.

Perhaps we can try ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R in position 2, E in position 4? And letters T, R, I, E, D.

No A, C, N.

This seems good: it covers T, I, E, D and R.

Similarly, other options: ""DRIVE"": D R I V E? E in position 5? But we think E is not in position 5? The first feedback had E(-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, E must be elsewhere. So if we put E in position 5 again, we'd get a ""-"" again? But we can avoid that to see if it's in other positions.

In ""TRIED"", E is in position 4, so not 5. That might be good.

Another word: ""FRIED"": F R I E D.

But T might be more common.

Let's decide on ""TRIED"": 
- T in position 1, R in 2 (fixed), I in 3, E in 4, D in 5.

We'll learn:
- If T is present and correct position?
- If I is present and correct?
- If E is in position 4?
- If D is present?

And we know E is in, but not position 5.

Alternatively, we could try a word with E in position 1, such as ""ERGOT"": E R G O T.

But T and O are common.

Another option: ""OPERA"" has O in position 1? Then R in position 3? We need R in position 2? No, it should be second.

""PARER"" has R in multiple positions? But P and A? A is absent.

We know A is not present.

I think ""TRIED"" is a good candidate.

But let's see if there's a better word.

How about ""BRINE""? But N is absent? N was ruled out? Yes, N(x) so we cannot use BRINE.

Similarly, avoid N.

""BRIDE""? B R I D E? E at position 5? Wait, but we know E isn't at position 5? The secret word has E but not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 will give a ""-"" again? But that might be inefficient because we already know that E cannot be at position 5. So we want to put E elsewhere to see if it matches elsewhere.

Therefore, ""BRIDE"" has E at 5? So we should not use that because E at 5 will definitely be wrong? But it might tell us if it's in the word? But we already know E is in the word? Yes, from first feedback E(-).

So using E in position 5 again would be wasteful? But we could, but it's better to try E in another position to see where it might be.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TRIED"": T R I E D

We get to test T, I, E (in pos 4), D.

And R is confirmed.

So let's use ""tried"".

But is ""tried"" a valid word? Yes.

Another common word might be ""SPIRE""? S P I R E? But then R is in position 4? Not 2? Because we need R in position 2.

Pattern must be: ? R ? ? ? with second letter R.

""SPIRE"" has R in position 4 -> not good.

""TRIED"" seems fine.

So guess: tried

But in the word, we have E in position 4? Let's spell: T-R-I-E-D -> positions: T(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5).

Yes.

And D is at the end? We don't know about D.

Alternatively, ""PRICE""? But C is absent -> feedback said C(x) so cannot use.

Don't use C.

Similarly, no A or N.

So ""TRIED"" is valid.

We'll see what happens.

So next guess: tried

But note: the feedback also doesn't tell us if there are multiple occurrences? But for now, since we don't know, we'll assume no repeats until proven otherwise? But not necessary.

Another idea: What about ""GRUEL""? G R U E L? Then R in position 2, E in position 4? Letters G, R, U, E, L -> new: G, U, L.

But maybe T and S are more common? Not necessarily.

I'll go with tried.

In summary:
- Secret word has R in position 2.
- Contains E somewhere not position 5 (so positions 1,3,4)
- Does not contain C, A, N

Guess: tried
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).  
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  

For the next guess:  
- Must include E but not in position 5, so position 1, 3, or 4.  
- Must have R in position 2.  
- Exclude C, A, and N.  
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) to gather more information.  

The word ""tried"" fits:  
- T in position 1 tests a common consonant.  
- R in position 2 (confirmed).  
- I in position 3 tests a common vowel.  
- E in position 4 (tests the misplaced E from previous feedback).  
- D in position 5 tests another common consonant.  

This guess maximizes new letter coverage while honoring known constraints.

So ""TRIED"" is valid.

We'll see what happens.

So next guess: tried

But note: the feedback also doesn't tell us if there are multiple occurrences? But for now, since we don't know, we'll assume no repeats until proven otherwise? But not necessary.

Another idea: What about ""GRUEL""? G R U E L? Then R in position 2, E in position 4? Letters G, R, U, E, L -> new: G, U, L.

But maybe T and S are more common? Not necessarily.

I'll go with tried.

In summary:
- Secret word has R in position 2.
- Contains E somewhere not position 5 (so positions 1,3,4)
- Does not contain C, A, N

Guess: triedBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).  
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  

For the next guess:  
- Must include E but not in position 5, so position 1, 3, or 4.  
- Must have R in position 2.  
- Exclude C, A, and N.  
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) to gather more information.  

The word ""tried"" fits:  
- T in position 1 tests a common consonant.  
- R in position 2 (confirmed).  
- I in position 3 tests a common vowel.  
- E in position 4 (tests the misplaced E from previous feedback).  
- D in position 5 tests another common consonant.  

This guess maximizes new letter coverage while honoring known constraints.",Guess 2: tried -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,DRYER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game, so we have no previous feedback. We need to make a first guess.
 Since the first guess is arbitrary, it's best to choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information gained.
 Common vowels and consonants in English are good to include. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"" are often used as starters.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. This covers two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).

 Note: We are only returning the guessed word in the specified format.For the first guess without any prior information, a strategic approach is to use a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize feedback. ""CRANE"" is an excellent starter word because it contains three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N), helping gather broad information about potential matches in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- R is in the secret word and is in the correct position (position 2, since positions are 1-indexed: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5).
- E is in the secret word but not in the correct position (so E is present somewhere else).
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position.
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the fifth position (because E was guessed in position 5 and got a ""-"", meaning it's misplaced).
- The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

For our next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word that includes E (since E is in the secret word) and excludes C, A, N.
- Must have R in the second position.
- The letter E must appear, but not in the fifth position (so it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4).

We also want to try to cover other common letters to gather more information.

Possible strategy:
- We can try to include other vowels or common consonants that haven't been tested yet. We know A is not present, but there are other vowels: O, I, U (but A is out). We also have consonants left to try.

Since E must be in the word but not at the end, let's think of words with R in the second position and E in either position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's list some options:

Option: E in position 1 - so pattern: _ R _ _ _
For example: ERGOT, ERODE, etc. But we cannot use O because position 3? Wait, we don't know about O yet.

But note: We haven't ruled out O, I, U, or many other letters.

We should also avoid repeating letters we know are not present: C, A, N.

Since E is misplaced and was in position 5 originally, we can try putting E in a different position.

Possible positions for E: 1, 3, or 4.

Let me try to think of words that have R in the second position and contain E.

Also, to get more information, we can try a word with new common letters.

Common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

For example:
- Position 1: E -> EREST? Not a word. How about ""E"" at start: E in position 1 -> words like EGRET, ECLAT? ECLAT has A and we know A is not present. Oops.

We must avoid A.

Another idea: Since we know E is in the word, let's put E in position 1:

Examples:
- ERIST (not common, but ""ERASE"" has A which is absent) -> avoid A and N and C.
- Better: ""ERODE"" - has O and D? But O hasn't been tested.

ERODE: 
- Position: E (1), R (2), O (3), D (4), E (5) -> but we have two E's? Actually, the word is E-R-O-D-E? Wait, no, ERODE is E-R-O-D-E? It's 5 letters: E R O D E? Actually, ""ERODE"" is spelled E-R-O-D-E? Wait, that's 5 letters? E, R, O, D, E. But we have E repeated? But the secret word might have repeated letters? The rules don't say it can't, but typically Wordle allows repeats? But in our feedback, if there are repeats, the feedback can be tricky. However, let's avoid repeats for now if possible.

But E is only known to appear once? We don't know if it appears twice.

Better: Use a word without repeating E for now to avoid ambiguity.

So avoid repeating E in the guess? Not necessary, but for simplicity.

Another word: ""BERYL"" - but we don't know about B and Y and L? And R is in position 2? B-E-R-Y-L: position 2 is E? But we need R in position 2.

We need R in the second character.

Pattern: ? R ? ? ?

With E in one of: position 1, 3, 4.

Let me list:

Position 1: E -> E R ? ? ?
Then the word must not contain A, C, N, and E must not be in position 5? But we are putting E in position 1, so that's fine.

Examples: 
- ERECT (has C? We know C is not present) -> invalid.
- ERGOT: E R G O T -> letters: E, R, G, O, T. No C, A, N. So valid?
- EROSE: E R O S E -> has two E's? But O and S are new.

Position 3: E -> ? R E ? ?
Examples: 
- TREND: T R E N D -> but N is present? We know N is not in the secret word? Feedback from first guess says N(x). So N is not present -> cannot use TREND.
- BREED: B R E E D -> two E's? and D? Also, no N, C, A.
- CREME? But C is invalid.

Position 4: E -> ? R ? E ?
Examples: 
- BRIEF: B R I E F -> has I, E, F? But no A, C, N? OK.
- GRIEF: same thing.

But note, we also want to test more common letters.

I think ""BERET"" but that has E in position 1 and 4? B E R E T? Position 2 is E? Not R.

No, we need R exactly in position 2.

Another idea: Use a word with E and also S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Goal: Cover S, T, O, I to see if they are in the word.

Let's think of: ""PRESET""? Too many letters? Must be 5-letter.

""PRESS"": P R E S S? That's only 4 unique letters? And S repeated.

But ""PRESS"" has R in position 2 and E in position 3.

PRESS: letters P, R, E, S, S. We avoid A, C, N.

Similarly, ""TRESS"": T R E S S -> T, R, E, S.

That could work: T R E S S? Wait that has two S's.

But it's valid? Yes.

Alternatively, ""BRISK"" - but we don't know if B or S or K is present.

But let's consider: Since E must be somewhere between positions 1-4 excluding position 5.

Perhaps we can try ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R in position 2, E in position 4? And letters T, R, I, E, D.

No A, C, N.

This seems good: it covers T, I, E, D and R.

Similarly, other options: ""DRIVE"": D R I V E? E in position 5? But we think E is not in position 5? The first feedback had E(-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, E must be elsewhere. So if we put E in position 5 again, we'd get a ""-"" again? But we can avoid that to see if it's in other positions.

In ""TRIED"", E is in position 4, so not 5. That might be good.

Another word: ""FRIED"": F R I E D.

But T might be more common.

Let's decide on ""TRIED"": 
- T in position 1, R in 2 (fixed), I in 3, E in 4, D in 5.

We'll learn:
- If T is present and correct position?
- If I is present and correct?
- If E is in position 4?
- If D is present?

And we know E is in, but not position 5.

Alternatively, we could try a word with E in position 1, such as ""ERGOT"": E R G O T.

But T and O are common.

Another option: ""OPERA"" has O in position 1? Then R in position 3? We need R in position 2? No, it should be second.

""PARER"" has R in multiple positions? But P and A? A is absent.

We know A is not present.

I think ""TRIED"" is a good candidate.

But let's see if there's a better word.

How about ""BRINE""? But N is absent? N was ruled out? Yes, N(x) so we cannot use BRINE.

Similarly, avoid N.

""BRIDE""? B R I D E? E at position 5? Wait, but we know E isn't at position 5? The secret word has E but not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 will give a ""-"" again? But that might be inefficient because we already know that E cannot be at position 5. So we want to put E elsewhere to see if it matches elsewhere.

Therefore, ""BRIDE"" has E at 5? So we should not use that because E at 5 will definitely be wrong? But it might tell us if it's in the word? But we already know E is in the word? Yes, from first feedback E(-).

So using E in position 5 again would be wasteful? But we could, but it's better to try E in another position to see where it might be.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TRIED"": T R I E D

We get to test T, I, E (in pos 4), D.

And R is confirmed.

So let's use ""tried"".

But is ""tried"" a valid word? Yes.

Another common word might be ""SPIRE""? S P I R E? But then R is in position 4? Not 2? Because we need R in position 2.

Pattern must be: ? R ? ? ? with second letter R.

""SPIRE"" has R in position 4 -> not good.

""TRIED"" seems fine.

So guess: tried

But in the word, we have E in position 4? Let's spell: T-R-I-E-D -> positions: T(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5).

Yes.

And D is at the end? We don't know about D.

Alternatively, ""PRICE""? But C is absent -> feedback said C(x) so cannot use.

Don't use C.

Similarly, no A or N.

So ""TRIED"" is valid.

We'll see what happens.

So next guess: tried

But note: the feedback also doesn't tell us if there are multiple occurrences? But for now, since we don't know, we'll assume no repeats until proven otherwise? But not necessary.

Another idea: What about ""GRUEL""? G R U E L? Then R in position 2, E in position 4? Letters G, R, U, E, L -> new: G, U, L.

But maybe T and S are more common? Not necessarily.

I'll go with tried.

In summary:
- Secret word has R in position 2.
- Contains E somewhere not position 5 (so positions 1,3,4)
- Does not contain C, A, N

Guess: triedBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).  
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  

For the next guess:  
- Must include E but not in position 5, so position 1, 3, or 4.  
- Must have R in position 2.  
- Exclude C, A, and N.  
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) to gather more information.  

The word ""tried"" fits:  
- T in position 1 tests a common consonant.  
- R in position 2 (confirmed).  
- I in position 3 tests a common vowel.  
- E in position 4 (tests the misplaced E from previous feedback).  
- D in position 5 tests another common consonant.  

This guess maximizes new letter coverage while honoring known constraints.

We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) at position 2
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Second guess: ""tried""
- T: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as before)
- I: not in word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 4? Wait, in ""tried"", E is at position 4, and it's marked correct? So E is in the secret word and in position 4.
- D: in word but wrong position (-) -> so D is in the word, but not at position 5.

So now we know:
- The secret word has R in position 2 and E in position 4.
- D is in the word, but not at position 5 (so it must be in position 1 or 3, since 2 and 4 are taken by R and E, and 5 is not allowed for D).
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, I.

Also, from the first guess, E was not in position 5, and now we know it's in position 4.

So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ E _

We know D is present, but not in position 5, so D must be in position 1 or 3.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: 
- Position 1: could be D or another letter (but D might be here) or we don't know.
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: could be D (if not in 1) or another letter, but must not be C, A, N, T, I.
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: must not be D (since D is misplaced from position 5 in ""tried""), and not C, A, N, T, I.

Also, D is in the word, so either position 1 or 3 must be D.

We can consider two cases: D in position 1 or D in position 3.

But we need to make a guess that tests these possibilities and also covers new letters.

Common letters left: S, O, U, L, P, M, G, B, etc.

We should avoid using any of the excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I.

Now, let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ E _ and include D in position 1 or 3, and also test other common letters.

First, if D is in position 1: D R _ E _
Then the word would be D R ? E ?

We need a letter for position 3 and 5. Position 3 cannot be any of the excluded, and position 5 cannot be D (but D is at 1, so position 5 is free).

But we don't know if D is at 1 or not.

Similarly, if D is at position 3: _ R D E _

We need to fill position 1 and 5.

We can try to guess a word that has D in position 1 to test that, and also include other new letters.

For example, ""drove"": D R O V E? But E is at position 5? Our pattern has E at position 4, so ""drove"" is D R O V E -> positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). But we need E at position 4, so this doesn't fit.

We must have E at position 4.

So pattern: _ R _ E _

So for position 3, it can be a letter, and position 5 a letter.

If we put D in position 1: D R ? E ?

Then we need a word like ""DRUPE"" (a fruit) -> D R U P E? But E is at position 5? We need E at position 4, so in ""DRUPE"", it would be D(1), R(2), U(3), P(4), E(5). But position 4 is P, not E? So that doesn't have E at position 4.

We must have the pattern: letter1, R, letter3, E, letter5.

So for example, ""DRIED"": D R I E D? But I is excluded (from guess2: I(x)), and also D at position 5? But we know D is not at position 5? And I is not in the word.

Invalid.

""DRONE"": D R O N E? But N is excluded (from guess1: N(x)), and E is at position 5? Not 4.

Not matching pattern.

We need E at position 4, so the fifth letter is separate.

Examples of words: 
- ""BREDE""? Not common.
- ""CREPE"": but C is excluded.
- ""FREED"": F R E E D? But E at position 3 and 4? Pattern: F(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). But we have E at position 4? Yes, but also at 3? And D at 5? But we know D is not at position 5? From feedback, D(-) in position 5, so D is not at 5. But in ""FREED"", D is at 5? So if we guess ""FREED"", D at 5 would be wrong? But we know D is not at 5, so it would get a ""-"" for D? But we are trying to find the word.

But let's think of words that fit the pattern and have E at 4.

Common words: 
- ""PRIDE"": P R I D E? But I is excluded (I(x) from guess2), and E at position 5? Not 4.
- ""BRIDE"": B R I D E? Same issue, I excluded and E at 5.
- ""TRADE"": T R A D E? T and A excluded, and E at 5.
- ""GRACE"": G R A C E? A and C excluded.

Not working.

How about ""DROVE"": D R O V E? E at 5, not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

List of words ending with E? But we have E at position 4, so the word ends with something else.

Pattern: _ R _ E X, where X is the last letter.

For example:
- ""GRAPE"": G R A P E? A excluded, and E at 5? Not 4.
- ""GRIME"": G R I M E? I excluded, E at 5.
- ""GROVE"": G R O V E? E at 5.

Not matching.

Perhaps ""URBEX""? Not a word.

Another idea: ""DWELL"" but no E at position 4.

We need to have E at position 4.

Let's think: words like ""HAREM"" but H A R E M? A excluded, and E at position 4? H(1), A(2)? But we need R at position 2.

Position 2 is R, so it must be: ? R ? E ?

So ""HAREM"" would be H A R E M -> positions: 1:H, 2:A? But we need 2:R, so not.

""BREME""? Not common.

Perhaps ""DRUSE"": D R U S E? E at position 5? D(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). But position 4 is S, not E.

We need position 4 to be E.

So the word must be: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

For example, ""WRITE"": W R I T E? But I and T excluded (T(x) from guess2, I(x) from guess2), and E at position 5? Not 4.

""CRWTH""? Not a word.

This is tricky.

Another common word: ""PROSE"": P R O S E? E at position 5? Not 4.

""ROUSE"": R O U S E? But position 1 is R? We need position 2 to be R, so position 1 must be something else.

""AROSE"": A R O S E? A excluded, and E at 5.

Not.

Perhaps we should consider that D might be in position 3.

So pattern: _ R D E _

Then we need to fill position 1 and 5.

Position 1: cannot be C, A, N, T, I.
Position 5: cannot be D, and not C, A, N, T, I.

Also, the word must contain D, which it does at position 3.

Examples:
- ""URDE_"" ? Not a word.
- ""BRDEN"" not a word.
- ""GRADE"": G R A D E? A excluded, and E at 5? Not 4.
- ""CRUDE"": C R U D E? C excluded, E at 5.
- ""PRUDE"": P R U D E? E at 5.
- ""DRUPE"": D R U P E? But D is at position 1, not 3.

For D at position 3: the word is ? R D E ?

So ""PRUDE"" is P R U D E -> positions: P(1), R(2), U(3), D(4), E(5). But we need E at position 4? Here position 4 is D, not E.

We need position 4 to be E, so in this case, for D at position 3, the word would be: position 1: ?, position 2: R, position 3: D, position 4: E, position 5: ?

So like ""? R D E ?""

Examples: 
- ""URDE_"" not a word.
- ""ARDEC"" not a word.
- ""BRD E"" not.

Perhaps ""BREAD"": B R E A D? But E is at position 3, not 4? B(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). But we need E at position 4, so position 4 is A, not E.

Not matching.

Maybe it's not a common word? Or we are missing something.

Another idea: perhaps ""D"" is in position 1, and we have a word like ""DREGS""? But ""DREGS"" is D R E G S -> positions: D(1), R(2), E(3), G(4), S(5). But we need E at position 4? Here position 4 is G, not E.

Not.

""DRESS"": D R E S S -> D(1), R(2), E(3), S(4), S(5). Position 4 is S, not E.

We need position 4 to be E.

Let's list words that have the pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

And the third letter is not fixed.

For example:
- ""TRUCE"": T R U C E? T and C excluded, E at 5.
- ""GROPE"": G R O P E? E at 5.
- ""WRECK"": W R E C K? C excluded, and E at position 3, not 4.
- ""BREAK"": B R E A K? A excluded, E at 3.

Perhaps ""GREBE"": G R E B E? But E at position 3 and 5, and position 4 is B? G(1), R(2), E(3), B(4), E(5). So position 4 is B, not E.

Not.

""FREMD"": not a word.

I think I found one: ""BREDE"" is a word? It means a breed or something, but not common.

""CREDO"": C R E D O? C excluded, and E at position 3, not 4.

Position 3 is E in many cases, but we need position 4 to be E.

Another one: ""ARET E"" not.

Perhaps ""Oread"" but it's 5 letters? O R E A D? O(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). A excluded, and E at 3.

Not.

Let's think differently. We know the word has R at 2, E at 4, and D is present but not at 5, so at 1 or 3.

Also, from the first guess, E was not at 5, which is consistent.

Now, for our guess, we can try to put D in position 1 to test that.

So guess: D R ? E ?

But what to put for position 3 and 5.

Position 3: we can put a common letter not excluded, like S, O, U, L, etc.

Position 5: similarly.

For example, ""DRUSE"" but E at 5? Not.

We need position 4 to be E, so position 5 is a different letter.

So ""DR?E?"" with the fourth letter E.

For example, ""DRUZE"": D R U Z E? E at position 5? D(1), R(2), U(3), Z(4), E(5). Position 4 is Z, not E.

Not.

""DRIVE"": D R I V E? I excluded, E at 5.

Not.

""DRONE"": D R O N E? N excluded, E at 5.

Not.

""DRAPE"": D R A P E? A excluded, E at 5.

Not.

Perhaps ""DROME"": D R O M E? E at position 5? D(1), R(2), O(3), M(4), E(5). Position 4 is M, not E.

But we need position 4 to be E, so in the guess, we are not putting E at 4? No, for the secret word, position 4 is E, but in our guess, we can have different letters.

For our guess, we are trying to find a word that has the pattern with R at 2 and E at 4, and includes D somewhere.

So for the guess, we can have: position 2: R, position 4: E, and then position 1,3,5 to be filled, with D in one of 1,3, or 5? But D cannot be at 5, so 1 or 3.

And avoid C,A,N,T,I.

So let's list possible words:

- If D at 1: D R ? E ?
  - Need a letter for 3 and 5.
  - Words: ""DROME"" -> D R O M E? But position 4 is M? No, in ""DROME"", it's D-R-O-M-E, so position 4 is M, not E. We need the guess to have E at position 4, so the guess must have E as the fourth letter.

The guess must be a 5-letter word with R at position 2 and E at position 4.

For example, ""IRATE"" has R at position 2? I R A T E -> position 2 is R, position 4 is T, not E.

""OPERA"": O P E R A? Position 2 is P, not R.

We need position 2 to be R and position 4 to be E.

So the guess pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

And the word must contain D, which is not at position 5, so in position 1 or 3.

Also, the letters at 1,3,5 must not be C,A,N,T,I.

Let's search for words that match [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

For example:
- ""URBAN"" but position 4 is A, not E.
- ""ARISE"": A R I S E? A and I excluded, position 4 is S, not E.
- ""TRICE"": T R I C E? T,I,C excluded, position 4 is C, not E.
- ""GRACE"": G R A C E? A,C excluded, position 4 is C, not E.
- ""BRUTE"": B R U T E? T excluded, position 4 is T, not E.
- ""PRIME"": P R I M E? I excluded, position 4 is M, not E.
- ""CRANE"": already guessed, and C,A,N excluded.
- ""FRAME"": F R A M E? A excluded, position 4 is M, not E.
- ""GRAZE"": G R A Z E? A excluded, position 4 is Z, not E.
- ""DRAKE"": D R A K E? A excluded, position 4 is K, not E.
- ""WRITE"": W R I T E? I,T excluded, position 4 is T, not E.

I'm not finding many with E at position 4.

Another one: ""TROVE"": T R O V E? T excluded, position 4 is V, not E.

""PROBE"": P R O B E? Position 4 is B, not E.

""ROGUE"": R O G U E? Position 1 is R? We need position 2 to be R, so position 1 must be different. ""ROGUE"" has R at 1, not 2.

""AROSE"": A R O S E? A excluded, position 4 is S, not E.

""ERASE"": E R A S E? A excluded, position 4 is S, not E.

""CRISP"": C R I S P? C,I excluded, position 4 is S, not E.

Perhaps ""GREBE"": G R E B E? Position 3 is E, not 4.

I think I have a mistake: position 4 means the fourth letter.

In ""GREBE"", it's G-R-E-B-E, so position 1:G, 2:R, 3:E, 4:B, 5:E. So position 4 is B.

We need a word where the fourth letter is E.

For example, ""AXIOM"" not.

""OLEUM"" not.

""QUEUE"" not.

""ADIEU"" not.

Perhaps ""SPREE"": S P R E E? Position 2 is P, not R.

""TREES"": T R E E S? Position 2 is R, position 3 is E, position 4 is E? T(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), S(5). Yes, position 4 is E.

And it has R at position 2.

But does it contain D? ""TREES"" has T,R,E,E,S. No D.

But we know D is in the word, so we must include D in the guess or at least not contradict.

But in ""TREES"", there is no D, but the secret word has D, so if we guess ""TREES"", it would not have D, so the feedback for D would be missing, but we know D is in the word, so ""TREES"" cannot be the secret word because it lacks D.

So we can guess it to test, but it's not the secret word.

But we need to include D in our guess to gather information about its position.

So for our guess, we should include D.

Back to the pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

With D in position 1 or 3.

Position 3 is the third letter.

So if D in position 1: D R ? E ?

Then the third letter can be, say, U, and fifth letter S: ""DRUES""? Not a word.

D R O E S? ""DROES""? Not common, but ""DOES"" is 4 letters.

""DRUES"" not a word.

D R U E S? ""DRUES"" not recognized.

D R S E L? ""DRSEL"" not.

If D in position 3: ? R D E ?

For example, ""URDEA"" not.

""BRD E"" not.

""CRDEN"" not.

Perhaps ""ARD EB"" not.

I think ""BREAD"" but position 4 is A, not E.

Another idea: ""GRUED"" not a word.

Perhaps ""PREDY"" not.

Let's consider that D might be in position 1, and use a word like ""DREED"": D R E E D? But position 3 is E, not the fourth. D(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). Position 4 is E, yes.

And it has D at position 1 and 5.

But we know D is not at position 5 from previous feedback? In guess2, D was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning D is in the word but not at position 5. So in ""DREED"", if we put D at position 5, it would be wrong, but we know that, so it's okay for the guess, but the secret word won't have D at 5.

But ""DREED"" has E at position 3 and 4, and D at 1 and 5.

But position 4 is E, good.

But letters: D, R, E, E, D.

But we have T and I excluded, but E is allowed.

But is ""DREED"" a word? It might be a variant or rare.

Commonly, ""breed"" is used, but ""dreed"" is not standard.

Perhaps ""freed"" but F R E E D, position 2 is R, position 4 is E? F(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). Yes, position 4 is E.

And ""freed"" is a word.

But it has D at position 5, which we know is not correct for D, so in the feedback, D at 5 will get a ""-"", but that's fine for the guess.

Also, it has F at position 1, which is new.

And no C,A,N,T,I.

So ""freed"" could be a guess: F R E E D.

But position 3 is E, and position 4 is E, so two E's.

But the secret word has E at position 4, and we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are multiple E's.

In ""freed"", we have E at position 3 and 4.

But in the feedback, for position 3, if it's not E in the secret word, it might show something.

But let's see the secret word pattern: _ R _ E _

If we guess ""freed"", it would be:

Position 1: F
Position 2: R (correct)
Position 3: E
Position 4: E (correct, because secret has E at 4)
Position 5: D

Now, for position 3: if the secret word has E at position 3, it would be correct, but we don't know. If not, it might be absent or misplaced.

But we know the secret word has E at position 4, but it might not have E at position 3.

Also, D at position 5 will be wrong, but we know D is in the word, so it will show ""-"" for D.

But we want to test where D is.

Perhaps a better guess would be to put D in position 1 or 3.

For example, ""deare"" but not common, and A excluded.

Another word: ""berth"" but no E at 4.

I think ""freed"" is acceptable as a guess.

But let's find a word with D in position 1.

For example, ""duvet"" but no R at 2.

With R at 2 and E at 4: ""dr e at the 4th"".

"" D R ? E ? ""

""Drube"" not a word.

""Drone"" not.

Perhaps ""dhole"" but H O L E, not E at 4.

I found one: ""dicey"" not.

Another one: ""dizen"" has N.

Not.

Perhaps ""broke"" not.

Let's give up and use ""freed"" or find another.

What about ""greed"": G R E E D? Same as ""freed"", with G at 1.

G is new.

""Greed"": G R E E D.

Position 2: R (correct), position 4: E (correct), position 1: G, position 3: E, position 5: D.

And D at 5 will be ""-"", but we know.

But we can test G and the position of E at 3.

But the secret word may not have E at 3.

Another word: ""breed"" B R E E D, but B is new.

But ""breed"" has B at 1.

Or ""treed"" T R E E D, but T is excluded.

T is excluded, so cannot use T.

T is not in the word, so ""treed"" has T, invalid.

Similarly, ""creed"" has C, excluded.

So ""freed"" or ""greed"" or ""dreed"" (rare).

Let's use ""greed"": G R E E D.

But we can do better.

Another idea: since D is in the word and not at 5, and must be at 1 or 3, we can try a word that has D at position 1 and a new letter at 3 and 5.

For example, ""dusky"" but no R at 2.

With the pattern, ""dr e at 4"", so ""d?r?e?"".

""DUREE"" not a word.

"" DURED"" D U R E D? But position 2 is U, not R.

Not.

"" D R U E D"" not 5 letters.

I think we have to accept that for position 3, we can use a vowel or common consonant.

Let's use ""greed"" as a guess.

But ""greed"" has E at position 3, which might not be in the secret word, and we might get information.

Similarly, position 1 G.

So guess: greed

But let's confirm the feedback from guess2: for ""tried"", E was at position 4 and it was correct, so in the secret word, position 4 is E.

Yes.

So for the next guess, I'll go with ""greed"".

<guess>greed</guess>

But we have to output in the format.

Perhaps there's a better word.

Another common word: ""price"" but C and I excluded.

""Brume"" not.

""Frame"" A excluded.

I think ""greed"" is fine.

So:
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).  
  - E is in the secret word but not in position 5.  
  - C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: tried** → Feedback: T(x) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(-)  
  - R (position 2) and E (position 4) are confirmed correct.  
  - D is in the secret word but not in position 5.  
  - T and I are not in the secret word.  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
- **Positions**:  
  - Position 2 must be R.  
  - Position 4 must be E.  
- **Included Letters**:  
  - D must be in the word, but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 1 or 3).  
- **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, T, I (not in the word).  
- **Unknowns**:  
  - Position 1, 3, and 5 need to be filled with new letters.  
  - D's exact position (1 or 3) is unknown.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test D in position 1 to gather information (since it cannot be in position 5).  
- Cover new common letters (e.g., G, S, L, O) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid excluded letters (C, A, N, T, I).  
- The word must fit the pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter].  

The word **""greed""** is chosen because:  
- It has R in position 2 and E in position 4 (matching known positions).  
- It tests D in position 5 (which is known to be incorrect, but this will confirm D's absence there and may provide feedback on other positions).  
- It introduces G (position 1) and a double E (position 3), which tests for the presence of G and potential duplicate E.  
- It avoids all excluded letters.  

This guess will help clarify:  
- If G is in the word and its position.  
- If E is also in position 3 (via feedback).  
- D's status (though position 5 is known wrong, feedback may reveal if D is elsewhere).  

<guess>greed</guess>",greed,"We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) at position 2
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Second guess: ""tried""
- T: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as before)
- I: not in word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 4? Wait, in ""tried"", E is at position 4, and it's marked correct? So E is in the secret word and in position 4.
- D: in word but wrong position (-) -> so D is in the word, but not at position 5.

So now we know:
- The secret word has R in position 2 and E in position 4.
- D is in the word, but not at position 5 (so it must be in position 1 or 3, since 2 and 4 are taken by R and E, and 5 is not allowed for D).
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, I.

Also, from the first guess, E was not in position 5, and now we know it's in position 4.

So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ E _

We know D is present, but not in position 5, so D must be in position 1 or 3.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: 
- Position 1: could be D or another letter (but D might be here) or we don't know.
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: could be D (if not in 1) or another letter, but must not be C, A, N, T, I.
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: must not be D (since D is misplaced from position 5 in ""tried""), and not C, A, N, T, I.

Also, D is in the word, so either position 1 or 3 must be D.

We can consider two cases: D in position 1 or D in position 3.

But we need to make a guess that tests these possibilities and also covers new letters.

Common letters left: S, O, U, L, P, M, G, B, etc.

We should avoid using any of the excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I.

Now, let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ E _ and include D in position 1 or 3, and also test other common letters.

First, if D is in position 1: D R _ E _
Then the word would be D R ? E ?

We need a letter for position 3 and 5. Position 3 cannot be any of the excluded, and position 5 cannot be D (but D is at 1, so position 5 is free).

But we don't know if D is at 1 or not.

Similarly, if D is at position 3: _ R D E _

We need to fill position 1 and 5.

We can try to guess a word that has D in position 1 to test that, and also include other new letters.

For example, ""drove"": D R O V E? But E is at position 5? Our pattern has E at position 4, so ""drove"" is D R O V E -> positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). But we need E at position 4, so this doesn't fit.

We must have E at position 4.

So pattern: _ R _ E _

So for position 3, it can be a letter, and position 5 a letter.

If we put D in position 1: D R ? E ?

Then we need a word like ""DRUPE"" (a fruit) -> D R U P E? But E is at position 5? We need E at position 4, so in ""DRUPE"", it would be D(1), R(2), U(3), P(4), E(5). But position 4 is P, not E? So that doesn't have E at position 4.

We must have the pattern: letter1, R, letter3, E, letter5.

So for example, ""DRIED"": D R I E D? But I is excluded (from guess2: I(x)), and also D at position 5? But we know D is not at position 5? And I is not in the word.

Invalid.

""DRONE"": D R O N E? But N is excluded (from guess1: N(x)), and E is at position 5? Not 4.

Not matching pattern.

We need E at position 4, so the fifth letter is separate.

Examples of words: 
- ""BREDE""? Not common.
- ""CREPE"": but C is excluded.
- ""FREED"": F R E E D? But E at position 3 and 4? Pattern: F(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). But we have E at position 4? Yes, but also at 3? And D at 5? But we know D is not at position 5? From feedback, D(-) in position 5, so D is not at 5. But in ""FREED"", D is at 5? So if we guess ""FREED"", D at 5 would be wrong? But we know D is not at 5, so it would get a ""-"" for D? But we are trying to find the word.

But let's think of words that fit the pattern and have E at 4.

Common words: 
- ""PRIDE"": P R I D E? But I is excluded (I(x) from guess2), and E at position 5? Not 4.
- ""BRIDE"": B R I D E? Same issue, I excluded and E at 5.
- ""TRADE"": T R A D E? T and A excluded, and E at 5.
- ""GRACE"": G R A C E? A and C excluded.

Not working.

How about ""DROVE"": D R O V E? E at 5, not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

List of words ending with E? But we have E at position 4, so the word ends with something else.

Pattern: _ R _ E X, where X is the last letter.

For example:
- ""GRAPE"": G R A P E? A excluded, and E at 5? Not 4.
- ""GRIME"": G R I M E? I excluded, E at 5.
- ""GROVE"": G R O V E? E at 5.

Not matching.

Perhaps ""URBEX""? Not a word.

Another idea: ""DWELL"" but no E at position 4.

We need to have E at position 4.

Let's think: words like ""HAREM"" but H A R E M? A excluded, and E at position 4? H(1), A(2)? But we need R at position 2.

Position 2 is R, so it must be: ? R ? E ?

So ""HAREM"" would be H A R E M -> positions: 1:H, 2:A? But we need 2:R, so not.

""BREME""? Not common.

Perhaps ""DRUSE"": D R U S E? E at position 5? D(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). But position 4 is S, not E.

We need position 4 to be E.

So the word must be: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

For example, ""WRITE"": W R I T E? But I and T excluded (T(x) from guess2, I(x) from guess2), and E at position 5? Not 4.

""CRWTH""? Not a word.

This is tricky.

Another common word: ""PROSE"": P R O S E? E at position 5? Not 4.

""ROUSE"": R O U S E? But position 1 is R? We need position 2 to be R, so position 1 must be something else.

""AROSE"": A R O S E? A excluded, and E at 5.

Not.

Perhaps we should consider that D might be in position 3.

So pattern: _ R D E _

Then we need to fill position 1 and 5.

Position 1: cannot be C, A, N, T, I.
Position 5: cannot be D, and not C, A, N, T, I.

Also, the word must contain D, which it does at position 3.

Examples:
- ""URDE_"" ? Not a word.
- ""BRDEN"" not a word.
- ""GRADE"": G R A D E? A excluded, and E at 5? Not 4.
- ""CRUDE"": C R U D E? C excluded, E at 5.
- ""PRUDE"": P R U D E? E at 5.
- ""DRUPE"": D R U P E? But D is at position 1, not 3.

For D at position 3: the word is ? R D E ?

So ""PRUDE"" is P R U D E -> positions: P(1), R(2), U(3), D(4), E(5). But we need E at position 4? Here position 4 is D, not E.

We need position 4 to be E, so in this case, for D at position 3, the word would be: position 1: ?, position 2: R, position 3: D, position 4: E, position 5: ?

So like ""? R D E ?""

Examples: 
- ""URDE_"" not a word.
- ""ARDEC"" not a word.
- ""BRD E"" not.

Perhaps ""BREAD"": B R E A D? But E is at position 3, not 4? B(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). But we need E at position 4, so position 4 is A, not E.

Not matching.

Maybe it's not a common word? Or we are missing something.

Another idea: perhaps ""D"" is in position 1, and we have a word like ""DREGS""? But ""DREGS"" is D R E G S -> positions: D(1), R(2), E(3), G(4), S(5). But we need E at position 4? Here position 4 is G, not E.

Not.

""DRESS"": D R E S S -> D(1), R(2), E(3), S(4), S(5). Position 4 is S, not E.

We need position 4 to be E.

Let's list words that have the pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

And the third letter is not fixed.

For example:
- ""TRUCE"": T R U C E? T and C excluded, E at 5.
- ""GROPE"": G R O P E? E at 5.
- ""WRECK"": W R E C K? C excluded, and E at position 3, not 4.
- ""BREAK"": B R E A K? A excluded, E at 3.

Perhaps ""GREBE"": G R E B E? But E at position 3 and 5, and position 4 is B? G(1), R(2), E(3), B(4), E(5). So position 4 is B, not E.

Not.

""FREMD"": not a word.

I think I found one: ""BREDE"" is a word? It means a breed or something, but not common.

""CREDO"": C R E D O? C excluded, and E at position 3, not 4.

Position 3 is E in many cases, but we need position 4 to be E.

Another one: ""ARET E"" not.

Perhaps ""Oread"" but it's 5 letters? O R E A D? O(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). A excluded, and E at 3.

Not.

Let's think differently. We know the word has R at 2, E at 4, and D is present but not at 5, so at 1 or 3.

Also, from the first guess, E was not at 5, which is consistent.

Now, for our guess, we can try to put D in position 1 to test that.

So guess: D R ? E ?

But what to put for position 3 and 5.

Position 3: we can put a common letter not excluded, like S, O, U, L, etc.

Position 5: similarly.

For example, ""DRUSE"" but E at 5? Not.

We need position 4 to be E, so position 5 is a different letter.

So ""DR?E?"" with the fourth letter E.

For example, ""DRUZE"": D R U Z E? E at position 5? D(1), R(2), U(3), Z(4), E(5). Position 4 is Z, not E.

Not.

""DRIVE"": D R I V E? I excluded, E at 5.

Not.

""DRONE"": D R O N E? N excluded, E at 5.

Not.

""DRAPE"": D R A P E? A excluded, E at 5.

Not.

Perhaps ""DROME"": D R O M E? E at position 5? D(1), R(2), O(3), M(4), E(5). Position 4 is M, not E.

But we need position 4 to be E, so in the guess, we are not putting E at 4? No, for the secret word, position 4 is E, but in our guess, we can have different letters.

For our guess, we are trying to find a word that has the pattern with R at 2 and E at 4, and includes D somewhere.

So for the guess, we can have: position 2: R, position 4: E, and then position 1,3,5 to be filled, with D in one of 1,3, or 5? But D cannot be at 5, so 1 or 3.

And avoid C,A,N,T,I.

So let's list possible words:

- If D at 1: D R ? E ?
  - Need a letter for 3 and 5.
  - Words: ""DROME"" -> D R O M E? But position 4 is M? No, in ""DROME"", it's D-R-O-M-E, so position 4 is M, not E. We need the guess to have E at position 4, so the guess must have E as the fourth letter.

The guess must be a 5-letter word with R at position 2 and E at position 4.

For example, ""IRATE"" has R at position 2? I R A T E -> position 2 is R, position 4 is T, not E.

""OPERA"": O P E R A? Position 2 is P, not R.

We need position 2 to be R and position 4 to be E.

So the guess pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

And the word must contain D, which is not at position 5, so in position 1 or 3.

Also, the letters at 1,3,5 must not be C,A,N,T,I.

Let's search for words that match [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

For example:
- ""URBAN"" but position 4 is A, not E.
- ""ARISE"": A R I S E? A and I excluded, position 4 is S, not E.
- ""TRICE"": T R I C E? T,I,C excluded, position 4 is C, not E.
- ""GRACE"": G R A C E? A,C excluded, position 4 is C, not E.
- ""BRUTE"": B R U T E? T excluded, position 4 is T, not E.
- ""PRIME"": P R I M E? I excluded, position 4 is M, not E.
- ""CRANE"": already guessed, and C,A,N excluded.
- ""FRAME"": F R A M E? A excluded, position 4 is M, not E.
- ""GRAZE"": G R A Z E? A excluded, position 4 is Z, not E.
- ""DRAKE"": D R A K E? A excluded, position 4 is K, not E.
- ""WRITE"": W R I T E? I,T excluded, position 4 is T, not E.

I'm not finding many with E at position 4.

Another one: ""TROVE"": T R O V E? T excluded, position 4 is V, not E.

""PROBE"": P R O B E? Position 4 is B, not E.

""ROGUE"": R O G U E? Position 1 is R? We need position 2 to be R, so position 1 must be different. ""ROGUE"" has R at 1, not 2.

""AROSE"": A R O S E? A excluded, position 4 is S, not E.

""ERASE"": E R A S E? A excluded, position 4 is S, not E.

""CRISP"": C R I S P? C,I excluded, position 4 is S, not E.

Perhaps ""GREBE"": G R E B E? Position 3 is E, not 4.

I think I have a mistake: position 4 means the fourth letter.

In ""GREBE"", it's G-R-E-B-E, so position 1:G, 2:R, 3:E, 4:B, 5:E. So position 4 is B.

We need a word where the fourth letter is E.

For example, ""AXIOM"" not.

""OLEUM"" not.

""QUEUE"" not.

""ADIEU"" not.

Perhaps ""SPREE"": S P R E E? Position 2 is P, not R.

""TREES"": T R E E S? Position 2 is R, position 3 is E, position 4 is E? T(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), S(5). Yes, position 4 is E.

And it has R at position 2.

But does it contain D? ""TREES"" has T,R,E,E,S. No D.

But we know D is in the word, so we must include D in the guess or at least not contradict.

But in ""TREES"", there is no D, but the secret word has D, so if we guess ""TREES"", it would not have D, so the feedback for D would be missing, but we know D is in the word, so ""TREES"" cannot be the secret word because it lacks D.

So we can guess it to test, but it's not the secret word.

But we need to include D in our guess to gather information about its position.

So for our guess, we should include D.

Back to the pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

With D in position 1 or 3.

Position 3 is the third letter.

So if D in position 1: D R ? E ?

Then the third letter can be, say, U, and fifth letter S: ""DRUES""? Not a word.

D R O E S? ""DROES""? Not common, but ""DOES"" is 4 letters.

""DRUES"" not a word.

D R U E S? ""DRUES"" not recognized.

D R S E L? ""DRSEL"" not.

If D in position 3: ? R D E ?

For example, ""URDEA"" not.

""BRD E"" not.

""CRDEN"" not.

Perhaps ""ARD EB"" not.

I think ""BREAD"" but position 4 is A, not E.

Another idea: ""GRUED"" not a word.

Perhaps ""PREDY"" not.

Let's consider that D might be in position 1, and use a word like ""DREED"": D R E E D? But position 3 is E, not the fourth. D(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). Position 4 is E, yes.

And it has D at position 1 and 5.

But we know D is not at position 5 from previous feedback? In guess2, D was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning D is in the word but not at position 5. So in ""DREED"", if we put D at position 5, it would be wrong, but we know that, so it's okay for the guess, but the secret word won't have D at 5.

But ""DREED"" has E at position 3 and 4, and D at 1 and 5.

But position 4 is E, good.

But letters: D, R, E, E, D.

But we have T and I excluded, but E is allowed.

But is ""DREED"" a word? It might be a variant or rare.

Commonly, ""breed"" is used, but ""dreed"" is not standard.

Perhaps ""freed"" but F R E E D, position 2 is R, position 4 is E? F(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). Yes, position 4 is E.

And ""freed"" is a word.

But it has D at position 5, which we know is not correct for D, so in the feedback, D at 5 will get a ""-"", but that's fine for the guess.

Also, it has F at position 1, which is new.

And no C,A,N,T,I.

So ""freed"" could be a guess: F R E E D.

But position 3 is E, and position 4 is E, so two E's.

But the secret word has E at position 4, and we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are multiple E's.

In ""freed"", we have E at position 3 and 4.

But in the feedback, for position 3, if it's not E in the secret word, it might show something.

But let's see the secret word pattern: _ R _ E _

If we guess ""freed"", it would be:

Position 1: F
Position 2: R (correct)
Position 3: E
Position 4: E (correct, because secret has E at 4)
Position 5: D

Now, for position 3: if the secret word has E at position 3, it would be correct, but we don't know. If not, it might be absent or misplaced.

But we know the secret word has E at position 4, but it might not have E at position 3.

Also, D at position 5 will be wrong, but we know D is in the word, so it will show ""-"" for D.

But we want to test where D is.

Perhaps a better guess would be to put D in position 1 or 3.

For example, ""deare"" but not common, and A excluded.

Another word: ""berth"" but no E at 4.

I think ""freed"" is acceptable as a guess.

But let's find a word with D in position 1.

For example, ""duvet"" but no R at 2.

With R at 2 and E at 4: ""dr e at the 4th"".

"" D R ? E ? ""

""Drube"" not a word.

""Drone"" not.

Perhaps ""dhole"" but H O L E, not E at 4.

I found one: ""dicey"" not.

Another one: ""dizen"" has N.

Not.

Perhaps ""broke"" not.

Let's give up and use ""freed"" or find another.

What about ""greed"": G R E E D? Same as ""freed"", with G at 1.

G is new.

""Greed"": G R E E D.

Position 2: R (correct), position 4: E (correct), position 1: G, position 3: E, position 5: D.

And D at 5 will be ""-"", but we know.

But we can test G and the position of E at 3.

But the secret word may not have E at 3.

Another word: ""breed"" B R E E D, but B is new.

But ""breed"" has B at 1.

Or ""treed"" T R E E D, but T is excluded.

T is excluded, so cannot use T.

T is not in the word, so ""treed"" has T, invalid.

Similarly, ""creed"" has C, excluded.

So ""freed"" or ""greed"" or ""dreed"" (rare).

Let's use ""greed"": G R E E D.

But we can do better.

Another idea: since D is in the word and not at 5, and must be at 1 or 3, we can try a word that has D at position 1 and a new letter at 3 and 5.

For example, ""dusky"" but no R at 2.

With the pattern, ""dr e at 4"", so ""d?r?e?"".

""DUREE"" not a word.

"" DURED"" D U R E D? But position 2 is U, not R.

Not.

"" D R U E D"" not 5 letters.

I think we have to accept that for position 3, we can use a vowel or common consonant.

Let's use ""greed"" as a guess.

But ""greed"" has E at position 3, which might not be in the secret word, and we might get information.

Similarly, position 1 G.

So guess: greed

But let's confirm the feedback from guess2: for ""tried"", E was at position 4 and it was correct, so in the secret word, position 4 is E.

Yes.

So for the next guess, I'll go with ""greed"".

<guess>greed</guess>

But we have to output in the format.

Perhaps there's a better word.

Another common word: ""price"" but C and I excluded.

""Brume"" not.

""Frame"" A excluded.

I think ""greed"" is fine.

So:Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).  
  - E is in the secret word but not in position 5.  
  - C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: tried** → Feedback: T(x) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(-)  
  - R (position 2) and E (position 4) are confirmed correct.  
  - D is in the secret word but not in position 5.  
  - T and I are not in the secret word.  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
- **Positions**:  
  - Position 2 must be R.  
  - Position 4 must be E.  
- **Included Letters**:  
  - D must be in the word, but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 1 or 3).  
- **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, T, I (not in the word).  
- **Unknowns**:  
  - Position 1, 3, and 5 need to be filled with new letters.  
  - D's exact position (1 or 3) is unknown.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test D in position 1 to gather information (since it cannot be in position 5).  
- Cover new common letters (e.g., G, S, L, O) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid excluded letters (C, A, N, T, I).  
- The word must fit the pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter].  

The word **""greed""** is chosen because:  
- It has R in position 2 and E in position 4 (matching known positions).  
- It tests D in position 5 (which is known to be incorrect, but this will confirm D's absence there and may provide feedback on other positions).  
- It introduces G (position 1) and a double E (position 3), which tests for the presence of G and potential duplicate E.  
- It avoids all excluded letters.  

This guess will help clarify:  
- If G is in the word and its position.  
- If E is also in position 3 (via feedback).  
- D's status (though position 5 is known wrong, feedback may reveal if D is elsewhere).",Guess 3: greed -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) E(-) E(✓) D(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game, so we have no previous feedback. We need to make a first guess.
 Since the first guess is arbitrary, it's best to choose a word that covers common letters and maximizes the information gained.
 Common vowels and consonants in English are good to include. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"" are often used as starters.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. This covers two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).

 Note: We are only returning the guessed word in the specified format.For the first guess without any prior information, a strategic approach is to use a word that includes common vowels and consonants to maximize feedback. ""CRANE"" is an excellent starter word because it contains three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N), helping gather broad information about potential matches in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane""
Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)

Interpretation:
- R is in the secret word and is in the correct position (position 2, since positions are 1-indexed: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5).
- E is in the secret word but not in the correct position (so E is present somewhere else).
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word.

Therefore, we know:
- The secret word has the letter R in the second position.
- The secret word contains the letter E, but not in the fifth position (because E was guessed in position 5 and got a ""-"", meaning it's misplaced).
- The secret word does not contain C, A, or N.

For our next guess:
- Must be a 5-letter word that includes E (since E is in the secret word) and excludes C, A, N.
- Must have R in the second position.
- The letter E must appear, but not in the fifth position (so it must be in positions 1, 3, or 4).

We also want to try to cover other common letters to gather more information.

Possible strategy:
- We can try to include other vowels or common consonants that haven't been tested yet. We know A is not present, but there are other vowels: O, I, U (but A is out). We also have consonants left to try.

Since E must be in the word but not at the end, let's think of words with R in the second position and E in either position 1, 3, or 4.

Let's list some options:

Option: E in position 1 - so pattern: _ R _ _ _
For example: ERGOT, ERODE, etc. But we cannot use O because position 3? Wait, we don't know about O yet.

But note: We haven't ruled out O, I, U, or many other letters.

We should also avoid repeating letters we know are not present: C, A, N.

Since E is misplaced and was in position 5 originally, we can try putting E in a different position.

Possible positions for E: 1, 3, or 4.

Let me try to think of words that have R in the second position and contain E.

Also, to get more information, we can try a word with new common letters.

Common letters to consider: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

For example:
- Position 1: E -> EREST? Not a word. How about ""E"" at start: E in position 1 -> words like EGRET, ECLAT? ECLAT has A and we know A is not present. Oops.

We must avoid A.

Another idea: Since we know E is in the word, let's put E in position 1:

Examples:
- ERIST (not common, but ""ERASE"" has A which is absent) -> avoid A and N and C.
- Better: ""ERODE"" - has O and D? But O hasn't been tested.

ERODE: 
- Position: E (1), R (2), O (3), D (4), E (5) -> but we have two E's? Actually, the word is E-R-O-D-E? Wait, no, ERODE is E-R-O-D-E? It's 5 letters: E R O D E? Actually, ""ERODE"" is spelled E-R-O-D-E? Wait, that's 5 letters? E, R, O, D, E. But we have E repeated? But the secret word might have repeated letters? The rules don't say it can't, but typically Wordle allows repeats? But in our feedback, if there are repeats, the feedback can be tricky. However, let's avoid repeats for now if possible.

But E is only known to appear once? We don't know if it appears twice.

Better: Use a word without repeating E for now to avoid ambiguity.

So avoid repeating E in the guess? Not necessary, but for simplicity.

Another word: ""BERYL"" - but we don't know about B and Y and L? And R is in position 2? B-E-R-Y-L: position 2 is E? But we need R in position 2.

We need R in the second character.

Pattern: ? R ? ? ?

With E in one of: position 1, 3, 4.

Let me list:

Position 1: E -> E R ? ? ?
Then the word must not contain A, C, N, and E must not be in position 5? But we are putting E in position 1, so that's fine.

Examples: 
- ERECT (has C? We know C is not present) -> invalid.
- ERGOT: E R G O T -> letters: E, R, G, O, T. No C, A, N. So valid?
- EROSE: E R O S E -> has two E's? But O and S are new.

Position 3: E -> ? R E ? ?
Examples: 
- TREND: T R E N D -> but N is present? We know N is not in the secret word? Feedback from first guess says N(x). So N is not present -> cannot use TREND.
- BREED: B R E E D -> two E's? and D? Also, no N, C, A.
- CREME? But C is invalid.

Position 4: E -> ? R ? E ?
Examples: 
- BRIEF: B R I E F -> has I, E, F? But no A, C, N? OK.
- GRIEF: same thing.

But note, we also want to test more common letters.

I think ""BERET"" but that has E in position 1 and 4? B E R E T? Position 2 is E? Not R.

No, we need R exactly in position 2.

Another idea: Use a word with E and also S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Goal: Cover S, T, O, I to see if they are in the word.

Let's think of: ""PRESET""? Too many letters? Must be 5-letter.

""PRESS"": P R E S S? That's only 4 unique letters? And S repeated.

But ""PRESS"" has R in position 2 and E in position 3.

PRESS: letters P, R, E, S, S. We avoid A, C, N.

Similarly, ""TRESS"": T R E S S -> T, R, E, S.

That could work: T R E S S? Wait that has two S's.

But it's valid? Yes.

Alternatively, ""BRISK"" - but we don't know if B or S or K is present.

But let's consider: Since E must be somewhere between positions 1-4 excluding position 5.

Perhaps we can try ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R in position 2, E in position 4? And letters T, R, I, E, D.

No A, C, N.

This seems good: it covers T, I, E, D and R.

Similarly, other options: ""DRIVE"": D R I V E? E in position 5? But we think E is not in position 5? The first feedback had E(-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, E must be elsewhere. So if we put E in position 5 again, we'd get a ""-"" again? But we can avoid that to see if it's in other positions.

In ""TRIED"", E is in position 4, so not 5. That might be good.

Another word: ""FRIED"": F R I E D.

But T might be more common.

Let's decide on ""TRIED"": 
- T in position 1, R in 2 (fixed), I in 3, E in 4, D in 5.

We'll learn:
- If T is present and correct position?
- If I is present and correct?
- If E is in position 4?
- If D is present?

And we know E is in, but not position 5.

Alternatively, we could try a word with E in position 1, such as ""ERGOT"": E R G O T.

But T and O are common.

Another option: ""OPERA"" has O in position 1? Then R in position 3? We need R in position 2? No, it should be second.

""PARER"" has R in multiple positions? But P and A? A is absent.

We know A is not present.

I think ""TRIED"" is a good candidate.

But let's see if there's a better word.

How about ""BRINE""? But N is absent? N was ruled out? Yes, N(x) so we cannot use BRINE.

Similarly, avoid N.

""BRIDE""? B R I D E? E at position 5? Wait, but we know E isn't at position 5? The secret word has E but not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 will give a ""-"" again? But that might be inefficient because we already know that E cannot be at position 5. So we want to put E elsewhere to see if it matches elsewhere.

Therefore, ""BRIDE"" has E at 5? So we should not use that because E at 5 will definitely be wrong? But it might tell us if it's in the word? But we already know E is in the word? Yes, from first feedback E(-).

So using E in position 5 again would be wasteful? But we could, but it's better to try E in another position to see where it might be.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TRIED"": T R I E D

We get to test T, I, E (in pos 4), D.

And R is confirmed.

So let's use ""tried"".

But is ""tried"" a valid word? Yes.

Another common word might be ""SPIRE""? S P I R E? But then R is in position 4? Not 2? Because we need R in position 2.

Pattern must be: ? R ? ? ? with second letter R.

""SPIRE"" has R in position 4 -> not good.

""TRIED"" seems fine.

So guess: tried

But in the word, we have E in position 4? Let's spell: T-R-I-E-D -> positions: T(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5).

Yes.

And D is at the end? We don't know about D.

Alternatively, ""PRICE""? But C is absent -> feedback said C(x) so cannot use.

Don't use C.

Similarly, no A or N.

So ""TRIED"" is valid.

We'll see what happens.

So next guess: tried

But note: the feedback also doesn't tell us if there are multiple occurrences? But for now, since we don't know, we'll assume no repeats until proven otherwise? But not necessary.

Another idea: What about ""GRUEL""? G R U E L? Then R in position 2, E in position 4? Letters G, R, U, E, L -> new: G, U, L.

But maybe T and S are more common? Not necessarily.

I'll go with tried.

In summary:
- Secret word has R in position 2.
- Contains E somewhere not position 5 (so positions 1,3,4)
- Does not contain C, A, N

Guess: triedBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).  
- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4).  
- C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  

For the next guess:  
- Must include E but not in position 5, so position 1, 3, or 4.  
- Must have R in position 2.  
- Exclude C, A, and N.  
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) to gather more information.  

The word ""tried"" fits:  
- T in position 1 tests a common consonant.  
- R in position 2 (confirmed).  
- I in position 3 tests a common vowel.  
- E in position 4 (tests the misplaced E from previous feedback).  
- D in position 5 tests another common consonant.  

This guess maximizes new letter coverage while honoring known constraints.

<guess>tried</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tried -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) at position 2
- A: not in word (x)
- N: not in word (x)
- E: in word but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Second guess: ""tried""
- T: not in word (x)
- R: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as before)
- I: not in word (x)
- E: correct position (✓) at position 4? Wait, in ""tried"", E is at position 4, and it's marked correct? So E is in the secret word and in position 4.
- D: in word but wrong position (-) -> so D is in the word, but not at position 5.

So now we know:
- The secret word has R in position 2 and E in position 4.
- D is in the word, but not at position 5 (so it must be in position 1 or 3, since 2 and 4 are taken by R and E, and 5 is not allowed for D).
- The word does not contain: C, A, N, T, I.

Also, from the first guess, E was not in position 5, and now we know it's in position 4.

So the secret word pattern is: _ R _ E _

We know D is present, but not in position 5, so D must be in position 1 or 3.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: 
- Position 1: could be D or another letter (but D might be here) or we don't know.
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: could be D (if not in 1) or another letter, but must not be C, A, N, T, I.
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: must not be D (since D is misplaced from position 5 in ""tried""), and not C, A, N, T, I.

Also, D is in the word, so either position 1 or 3 must be D.

We can consider two cases: D in position 1 or D in position 3.

But we need to make a guess that tests these possibilities and also covers new letters.

Common letters left: S, O, U, L, P, M, G, B, etc.

We should avoid using any of the excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I.

Now, let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ E _ and include D in position 1 or 3, and also test other common letters.

First, if D is in position 1: D R _ E _
Then the word would be D R ? E ?

We need a letter for position 3 and 5. Position 3 cannot be any of the excluded, and position 5 cannot be D (but D is at 1, so position 5 is free).

But we don't know if D is at 1 or not.

Similarly, if D is at position 3: _ R D E _

We need to fill position 1 and 5.

We can try to guess a word that has D in position 1 to test that, and also include other new letters.

For example, ""drove"": D R O V E? But E is at position 5? Our pattern has E at position 4, so ""drove"" is D R O V E -> positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). But we need E at position 4, so this doesn't fit.

We must have E at position 4.

So pattern: _ R _ E _

So for position 3, it can be a letter, and position 5 a letter.

If we put D in position 1: D R ? E ?

Then we need a word like ""DRUPE"" (a fruit) -> D R U P E? But E is at position 5? We need E at position 4, so in ""DRUPE"", it would be D(1), R(2), U(3), P(4), E(5). But position 4 is P, not E? So that doesn't have E at position 4.

We must have the pattern: letter1, R, letter3, E, letter5.

So for example, ""DRIED"": D R I E D? But I is excluded (from guess2: I(x)), and also D at position 5? But we know D is not at position 5? And I is not in the word.

Invalid.

""DRONE"": D R O N E? But N is excluded (from guess1: N(x)), and E is at position 5? Not 4.

Not matching pattern.

We need E at position 4, so the fifth letter is separate.

Examples of words: 
- ""BREDE""? Not common.
- ""CREPE"": but C is excluded.
- ""FREED"": F R E E D? But E at position 3 and 4? Pattern: F(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). But we have E at position 4? Yes, but also at 3? And D at 5? But we know D is not at position 5? From feedback, D(-) in position 5, so D is not at 5. But in ""FREED"", D is at 5? So if we guess ""FREED"", D at 5 would be wrong? But we know D is not at 5, so it would get a ""-"" for D? But we are trying to find the word.

But let's think of words that fit the pattern and have E at 4.

Common words: 
- ""PRIDE"": P R I D E? But I is excluded (I(x) from guess2), and E at position 5? Not 4.
- ""BRIDE"": B R I D E? Same issue, I excluded and E at 5.
- ""TRADE"": T R A D E? T and A excluded, and E at 5.
- ""GRACE"": G R A C E? A and C excluded.

Not working.

How about ""DROVE"": D R O V E? E at 5, not 4.

We need the fourth letter to be E.

List of words ending with E? But we have E at position 4, so the word ends with something else.

Pattern: _ R _ E X, where X is the last letter.

For example:
- ""GRAPE"": G R A P E? A excluded, and E at 5? Not 4.
- ""GRIME"": G R I M E? I excluded, E at 5.
- ""GROVE"": G R O V E? E at 5.

Not matching.

Perhaps ""URBEX""? Not a word.

Another idea: ""DWELL"" but no E at position 4.

We need to have E at position 4.

Let's think: words like ""HAREM"" but H A R E M? A excluded, and E at position 4? H(1), A(2)? But we need R at position 2.

Position 2 is R, so it must be: ? R ? E ?

So ""HAREM"" would be H A R E M -> positions: 1:H, 2:A? But we need 2:R, so not.

""BREME""? Not common.

Perhaps ""DRUSE"": D R U S E? E at position 5? D(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). But position 4 is S, not E.

We need position 4 to be E.

So the word must be: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

For example, ""WRITE"": W R I T E? But I and T excluded (T(x) from guess2, I(x) from guess2), and E at position 5? Not 4.

""CRWTH""? Not a word.

This is tricky.

Another common word: ""PROSE"": P R O S E? E at position 5? Not 4.

""ROUSE"": R O U S E? But position 1 is R? We need position 2 to be R, so position 1 must be something else.

""AROSE"": A R O S E? A excluded, and E at 5.

Not.

Perhaps we should consider that D might be in position 3.

So pattern: _ R D E _

Then we need to fill position 1 and 5.

Position 1: cannot be C, A, N, T, I.
Position 5: cannot be D, and not C, A, N, T, I.

Also, the word must contain D, which it does at position 3.

Examples:
- ""URDE_"" ? Not a word.
- ""BRDEN"" not a word.
- ""GRADE"": G R A D E? A excluded, and E at 5? Not 4.
- ""CRUDE"": C R U D E? C excluded, E at 5.
- ""PRUDE"": P R U D E? E at 5.
- ""DRUPE"": D R U P E? But D is at position 1, not 3.

For D at position 3: the word is ? R D E ?

So ""PRUDE"" is P R U D E -> positions: P(1), R(2), U(3), D(4), E(5). But we need E at position 4? Here position 4 is D, not E.

We need position 4 to be E, so in this case, for D at position 3, the word would be: position 1: ?, position 2: R, position 3: D, position 4: E, position 5: ?

So like ""? R D E ?""

Examples: 
- ""URDE_"" not a word.
- ""ARDEC"" not a word.
- ""BRD E"" not.

Perhaps ""BREAD"": B R E A D? But E is at position 3, not 4? B(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). But we need E at position 4, so position 4 is A, not E.

Not matching.

Maybe it's not a common word? Or we are missing something.

Another idea: perhaps ""D"" is in position 1, and we have a word like ""DREGS""? But ""DREGS"" is D R E G S -> positions: D(1), R(2), E(3), G(4), S(5). But we need E at position 4? Here position 4 is G, not E.

Not.

""DRESS"": D R E S S -> D(1), R(2), E(3), S(4), S(5). Position 4 is S, not E.

We need position 4 to be E.

Let's list words that have the pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

And the third letter is not fixed.

For example:
- ""TRUCE"": T R U C E? T and C excluded, E at 5.
- ""GROPE"": G R O P E? E at 5.
- ""WRECK"": W R E C K? C excluded, and E at position 3, not 4.
- ""BREAK"": B R E A K? A excluded, E at 3.

Perhaps ""GREBE"": G R E B E? But E at position 3 and 5, and position 4 is B? G(1), R(2), E(3), B(4), E(5). So position 4 is B, not E.

Not.

""FREMD"": not a word.

I think I found one: ""BREDE"" is a word? It means a breed or something, but not common.

""CREDO"": C R E D O? C excluded, and E at position 3, not 4.

Position 3 is E in many cases, but we need position 4 to be E.

Another one: ""ARET E"" not.

Perhaps ""Oread"" but it's 5 letters? O R E A D? O(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). A excluded, and E at 3.

Not.

Let's think differently. We know the word has R at 2, E at 4, and D is present but not at 5, so at 1 or 3.

Also, from the first guess, E was not at 5, which is consistent.

Now, for our guess, we can try to put D in position 1 to test that.

So guess: D R ? E ?

But what to put for position 3 and 5.

Position 3: we can put a common letter not excluded, like S, O, U, L, etc.

Position 5: similarly.

For example, ""DRUSE"" but E at 5? Not.

We need position 4 to be E, so position 5 is a different letter.

So ""DR?E?"" with the fourth letter E.

For example, ""DRUZE"": D R U Z E? E at position 5? D(1), R(2), U(3), Z(4), E(5). Position 4 is Z, not E.

Not.

""DRIVE"": D R I V E? I excluded, E at 5.

Not.

""DRONE"": D R O N E? N excluded, E at 5.

Not.

""DRAPE"": D R A P E? A excluded, E at 5.

Not.

Perhaps ""DROME"": D R O M E? E at position 5? D(1), R(2), O(3), M(4), E(5). Position 4 is M, not E.

But we need position 4 to be E, so in the guess, we are not putting E at 4? No, for the secret word, position 4 is E, but in our guess, we can have different letters.

For our guess, we are trying to find a word that has the pattern with R at 2 and E at 4, and includes D somewhere.

So for the guess, we can have: position 2: R, position 4: E, and then position 1,3,5 to be filled, with D in one of 1,3, or 5? But D cannot be at 5, so 1 or 3.

And avoid C,A,N,T,I.

So let's list possible words:

- If D at 1: D R ? E ?
  - Need a letter for 3 and 5.
  - Words: ""DROME"" -> D R O M E? But position 4 is M? No, in ""DROME"", it's D-R-O-M-E, so position 4 is M, not E. We need the guess to have E at position 4, so the guess must have E as the fourth letter.

The guess must be a 5-letter word with R at position 2 and E at position 4.

For example, ""IRATE"" has R at position 2? I R A T E -> position 2 is R, position 4 is T, not E.

""OPERA"": O P E R A? Position 2 is P, not R.

We need position 2 to be R and position 4 to be E.

So the guess pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

And the word must contain D, which is not at position 5, so in position 1 or 3.

Also, the letters at 1,3,5 must not be C,A,N,T,I.

Let's search for words that match [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

For example:
- ""URBAN"" but position 4 is A, not E.
- ""ARISE"": A R I S E? A and I excluded, position 4 is S, not E.
- ""TRICE"": T R I C E? T,I,C excluded, position 4 is C, not E.
- ""GRACE"": G R A C E? A,C excluded, position 4 is C, not E.
- ""BRUTE"": B R U T E? T excluded, position 4 is T, not E.
- ""PRIME"": P R I M E? I excluded, position 4 is M, not E.
- ""CRANE"": already guessed, and C,A,N excluded.
- ""FRAME"": F R A M E? A excluded, position 4 is M, not E.
- ""GRAZE"": G R A Z E? A excluded, position 4 is Z, not E.
- ""DRAKE"": D R A K E? A excluded, position 4 is K, not E.
- ""WRITE"": W R I T E? I,T excluded, position 4 is T, not E.

I'm not finding many with E at position 4.

Another one: ""TROVE"": T R O V E? T excluded, position 4 is V, not E.

""PROBE"": P R O B E? Position 4 is B, not E.

""ROGUE"": R O G U E? Position 1 is R? We need position 2 to be R, so position 1 must be different. ""ROGUE"" has R at 1, not 2.

""AROSE"": A R O S E? A excluded, position 4 is S, not E.

""ERASE"": E R A S E? A excluded, position 4 is S, not E.

""CRISP"": C R I S P? C,I excluded, position 4 is S, not E.

Perhaps ""GREBE"": G R E B E? Position 3 is E, not 4.

I think I have a mistake: position 4 means the fourth letter.

In ""GREBE"", it's G-R-E-B-E, so position 1:G, 2:R, 3:E, 4:B, 5:E. So position 4 is B.

We need a word where the fourth letter is E.

For example, ""AXIOM"" not.

""OLEUM"" not.

""QUEUE"" not.

""ADIEU"" not.

Perhaps ""SPREE"": S P R E E? Position 2 is P, not R.

""TREES"": T R E E S? Position 2 is R, position 3 is E, position 4 is E? T(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), S(5). Yes, position 4 is E.

And it has R at position 2.

But does it contain D? ""TREES"" has T,R,E,E,S. No D.

But we know D is in the word, so we must include D in the guess or at least not contradict.

But in ""TREES"", there is no D, but the secret word has D, so if we guess ""TREES"", it would not have D, so the feedback for D would be missing, but we know D is in the word, so ""TREES"" cannot be the secret word because it lacks D.

So we can guess it to test, but it's not the secret word.

But we need to include D in our guess to gather information about its position.

So for our guess, we should include D.

Back to the pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]

With D in position 1 or 3.

Position 3 is the third letter.

So if D in position 1: D R ? E ?

Then the third letter can be, say, U, and fifth letter S: ""DRUES""? Not a word.

D R O E S? ""DROES""? Not common, but ""DOES"" is 4 letters.

""DRUES"" not a word.

D R U E S? ""DRUES"" not recognized.

D R S E L? ""DRSEL"" not.

If D in position 3: ? R D E ?

For example, ""URDEA"" not.

""BRD E"" not.

""CRDEN"" not.

Perhaps ""ARD EB"" not.

I think ""BREAD"" but position 4 is A, not E.

Another idea: ""GRUED"" not a word.

Perhaps ""PREDY"" not.

Let's consider that D might be in position 1, and use a word like ""DREED"": D R E E D? But position 3 is E, not the fourth. D(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). Position 4 is E, yes.

And it has D at position 1 and 5.

But we know D is not at position 5 from previous feedback? In guess2, D was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning D is in the word but not at position 5. So in ""DREED"", if we put D at position 5, it would be wrong, but we know that, so it's okay for the guess, but the secret word won't have D at 5.

But ""DREED"" has E at position 3 and 4, and D at 1 and 5.

But position 4 is E, good.

But letters: D, R, E, E, D.

But we have T and I excluded, but E is allowed.

But is ""DREED"" a word? It might be a variant or rare.

Commonly, ""breed"" is used, but ""dreed"" is not standard.

Perhaps ""freed"" but F R E E D, position 2 is R, position 4 is E? F(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). Yes, position 4 is E.

And ""freed"" is a word.

But it has D at position 5, which we know is not correct for D, so in the feedback, D at 5 will get a ""-"", but that's fine for the guess.

Also, it has F at position 1, which is new.

And no C,A,N,T,I.

So ""freed"" could be a guess: F R E E D.

But position 3 is E, and position 4 is E, so two E's.

But the secret word has E at position 4, and we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are multiple E's.

In ""freed"", we have E at position 3 and 4.

But in the feedback, for position 3, if it's not E in the secret word, it might show something.

But let's see the secret word pattern: _ R _ E _

If we guess ""freed"", it would be:

Position 1: F
Position 2: R (correct)
Position 3: E
Position 4: E (correct, because secret has E at 4)
Position 5: D

Now, for position 3: if the secret word has E at position 3, it would be correct, but we don't know. If not, it might be absent or misplaced.

But we know the secret word has E at position 4, but it might not have E at position 3.

Also, D at position 5 will be wrong, but we know D is in the word, so it will show ""-"" for D.

But we want to test where D is.

Perhaps a better guess would be to put D in position 1 or 3.

For example, ""deare"" but not common, and A excluded.

Another word: ""berth"" but no E at 4.

I think ""freed"" is acceptable as a guess.

But let's find a word with D in position 1.

For example, ""duvet"" but no R at 2.

With R at 2 and E at 4: ""dr e at the 4th"".

"" D R ? E ? ""

""Drube"" not a word.

""Drone"" not.

Perhaps ""dhole"" but H O L E, not E at 4.

I found one: ""dicey"" not.

Another one: ""dizen"" has N.

Not.

Perhaps ""broke"" not.

Let's give up and use ""freed"" or find another.

What about ""greed"": G R E E D? Same as ""freed"", with G at 1.

G is new.

""Greed"": G R E E D.

Position 2: R (correct), position 4: E (correct), position 1: G, position 3: E, position 5: D.

And D at 5 will be ""-"", but we know.

But we can test G and the position of E at 3.

But the secret word may not have E at 3.

Another word: ""breed"" B R E E D, but B is new.

But ""breed"" has B at 1.

Or ""treed"" T R E E D, but T is excluded.

T is excluded, so cannot use T.

T is not in the word, so ""treed"" has T, invalid.

Similarly, ""creed"" has C, excluded.

So ""freed"" or ""greed"" or ""dreed"" (rare).

Let's use ""greed"": G R E E D.

But we can do better.

Another idea: since D is in the word and not at 5, and must be at 1 or 3, we can try a word that has D at position 1 and a new letter at 3 and 5.

For example, ""dusky"" but no R at 2.

With the pattern, ""dr e at 4"", so ""d?r?e?"".

""DUREE"" not a word.

"" DURED"" D U R E D? But position 2 is U, not R.

Not.

"" D R U E D"" not 5 letters.

I think we have to accept that for position 3, we can use a vowel or common consonant.

Let's use ""greed"" as a guess.

But ""greed"" has E at position 3, which might not be in the secret word, and we might get information.

Similarly, position 1 G.

So guess: greed

But let's confirm the feedback from guess2: for ""tried"", E was at position 4 and it was correct, so in the secret word, position 4 is E.

Yes.

So for the next guess, I'll go with ""greed"".

<guess>greed</guess>

But we have to output in the format.

Perhaps there's a better word.

Another common word: ""price"" but C and I excluded.

""Brume"" not.

""Frame"" A excluded.

I think ""greed"" is fine.

So:Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).  
  - E is in the secret word but not in position 5.  
  - C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: tried** → Feedback: T(x) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(-)  
  - R (position 2) and E (position 4) are confirmed correct.  
  - D is in the secret word but not in position 5.  
  - T and I are not in the secret word.  

### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:
- **Positions**:  
  - Position 2 must be R.  
  - Position 4 must be E.  
- **Included Letters**:  
  - D must be in the word, but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 1 or 3).  
- **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, T, I (not in the word).  
- **Unknowns**:  
  - Position 1, 3, and 5 need to be filled with new letters.  
  - D's exact position (1 or 3) is unknown.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test D in position 1 to gather information (since it cannot be in position 5).  
- Cover new common letters (e.g., G, S, L, O) to maximize information gain.  
- Avoid excluded letters (C, A, N, T, I).  
- The word must fit the pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter].  

The word **""greed""** is chosen because:  
- It has R in position 2 and E in position 4 (matching known positions).  
- It tests D in position 5 (which is known to be incorrect, but this will confirm D's absence there and may provide feedback on other positions).  
- It introduces G (position 1) and a double E (position 3), which tests for the presence of G and potential duplicate E.  
- It avoids all excluded letters.  

This guess will help clarify:  
- If G is in the word and its position.  
- If E is also in position 3 (via feedback).  
- D's status (though position 5 is known wrong, feedback may reveal if D is elsewhere).

We know A is not present, but there are other vowels: O, I, U (but A is out). We also have consonants left to try.\n\nSince E must be in the word but not at the end, let\'s think of words with R in the second position and E in either position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nLet\'s list some options:\n\nOption: E in position 1 - so pattern: _ R _ _ _\nFor example: ERGOT, ERODE, etc. But we cannot use O because position 3? Wait, we don\'t know about O yet.\n\nBut note: We haven\'t ruled out O, I, U, or many other letters.\n\nWe should also avoid repeating letters we know are not present: C, A, N.\n\nSince E is misplaced and was in position 5 originally, we can try putting E in a different position.\n\nPossible positions for E: 1, 3, or 4.\n\nLet me try to think of words that have R in the second position and contain E.\n\nAlso, to get more information, we can try a word with new common letters.\n\nCommon letters to consider: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\nFor example:\n- Position 1: E -> EREST? Not a word. How about ""E"" at start: E in position 1 -> words like EGRET, ECLAT? ECLAT has A and we know A is not present. Oops.\n\nWe must avoid A.\n\nAnother idea: Since we know E is in the word, let\'s put E in position 1:\n\nExamples:\n- ERIST (not common, but ""ERASE"" has A which is absent) -> avoid A and N and C.\n- Better: ""ERODE"" - has O and D? But O hasn\'t been tested.\n\nERODE: \n- Position: E (1), R (2), O (3), D (4), E (5) -> but we have two E\'s? Actually, the word is E-R-O-D-E? Wait, no, ERODE is E-R-O-D-E? It\'s 5 letters: E R O D E? Actually, ""ERODE"" is spelled E-R-O-D-E? Wait, that\'s 5 letters? E, R, O, D, E. But we have E repeated? But the secret word might have repeated letters? The rules don\'t say it can\'t, but typically Wordle allows repeats? But in our feedback, if there are repeats, the feedback can be tricky. However, let\'s avoid repeats for now if possible.\n\nBut E is only known to appear once? We don\'t know if it appears twice.\n\nBetter: Use a word without repeating E for now to avoid ambiguity.\n\nSo avoid repeating E in the guess? Not necessary, but for simplicity.\n\nAnother word: ""BERYL"" - but we don\'t know about B and Y and L? And R is in position 2? B-E-R-Y-L: position 2 is E? But we need R in position 2.\n\nWe need R in the second character.\n\nPattern: ? R ? ? ?\n\nWith E in one of: position 1, 3, 4.\n\nLet me list:\n\nPosition 1: E -> E R ? ? ?\nThen the word must not contain A, C, N, and E must not be in position 5? But we are putting E in position 1, so that\'s fine.\n\nExamples: \n- ERECT (has C? We know C is not present) -> invalid.\n- ERGOT: E R G O T -> letters: E, R, G, O, T. No C, A, N. So valid?\n- EROSE: E R O S E -> has two E\'s? But O and S are new.\n\nPosition 3: E -> ? R E ? ?\nExamples: \n- TREND: T R E N D -> but N is present? We know N is not in the secret word? Feedback from first guess says N(x). So N is not present -> cannot use TREND.\n- BREED: B R E E D -> two E\'s? and D? Also, no N, C, A.\n- CREME? But C is invalid.\n\nPosition 4: E -> ? R ? E ?\nExamples: \n- BRIEF: B R I E F -> has I, E, F? But no A, C, N? OK.\n- GRIEF: same thing.\n\nBut note, we also want to test more common letters.\n\nI think ""BERET"" but that has E in position 1 and 4? B E R E T? Position 2 is E? Not R.\n\nNo, we need R exactly in position 2.\n\nAnother idea: Use a word with E and also S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\nGoal: Cover S, T, O, I to see if they are in the word.\n\nLet\'s think of: ""PRESET""? Too many letters? Must be 5-letter.\n\n""PRESS"": P R E S S? That\'s only 4 unique letters? And S repeated.\n\nBut ""PRESS"" has R in position 2 and E in position 3.\n\nPRESS: letters P, R, E, S, S. We avoid A, C, N.\n\nSimilarly, ""TRESS"": T R E S S -> T, R, E, S.\n\nThat could work: T R E S S? Wait that has two S\'s.\n\nBut it\'s valid? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, ""BRISK"" - but we don\'t know if B or S or K is present.\n\nBut let\'s consider: Since E must be somewhere between positions 1-4 excluding position 5.\n\nPerhaps we can try ""TRIED"": T R I E D -> R in position 2, E in position 4? And letters T, R, I, E, D.\n\nNo A, C, N.\n\nThis seems good: it covers T, I, E, D and R.\n\nSimilarly, other options: ""DRIVE"": D R I V E? E in position 5? But we think E is not in position 5? The first feedback had E(-) meaning it is in the word but not in position 5. Therefore, E must be elsewhere. So if we put E in position 5 again, we\'d get a ""-"" again? But we can avoid that to see if it\'s in other positions.\n\nIn ""TRIED"", E is in position 4, so not 5. That might be good.\n\nAnother word: ""FRIED"": F R I E D.\n\nBut T might be more common.\n\nLet\'s decide on ""TRIED"": \n- T in position 1, R in 2 (fixed), I in 3, E in 4, D in 5.\n\nWe\'ll learn:\n- If T is present and correct position?\n- If I is present and correct?\n- If E is in position 4?\n- If D is present?\n\nAnd we know E is in, but not position 5.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word with E in position 1, such as ""ERGOT"": E R G O T.\n\nBut T and O are common.\n\nAnother option: ""OPERA"" has O in position 1? Then R in position 3? We need R in position 2? No, it should be second.\n\n""PARER"" has R in multiple positions? But P and A? A is absent.\n\nWe know A is not present.\n\nI think ""TRIED"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a better word.\n\nHow about ""BRINE""? But N is absent? N was ruled out? Yes, N(x) so we cannot use BRINE.\n\nSimilarly, avoid N.\n\n""BRIDE""? B R I D E? E at position 5? Wait, but we know E isn\'t at position 5? The secret word has E but not at position 5? So putting E at position 5 will give a ""-"" again? But that might be inefficient because we already know that E cannot be at position 5. So we want to put E elsewhere to see if it matches elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, ""BRIDE"" has E at 5? So we should not use that because E at 5 will definitely be wrong? But it might tell us if it\'s in the word? But we already know E is in the word? Yes, from first feedback E(-).\n\nSo using E in position 5 again would be wasteful? But we could, but it\'s better to try E in another position to see where it might be.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""TRIED"": T R I E D\n\nWe get to test T, I, E (in pos 4), D.\n\nAnd R is confirmed.\n\nSo let\'s use ""tried"".\n\nBut is ""tried"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother common word might be ""SPIRE""? S P I R E? But then R is in position 4? Not 2? Because we need R in position 2.\n\nPattern must be: ? R ? ? ? with second letter R.\n\n""SPIRE"" has R in position 4 -> not good.\n\n""TRIED"" seems fine.\n\nSo guess: tried\n\nBut in the word, we have E in position 4? Let\'s spell: T-R-I-E-D -> positions: T(1), R(2), I(3), E(4), D(5).\n\nYes.\n\nAnd D is at the end? We don\'t know about D.\n\nAlternatively, ""PRICE""? But C is absent -> feedback said C(x) so cannot use.\n\nDon\'t use C.\n\nSimilarly, no A or N.\n\nSo ""TRIED"" is valid.\n\nWe\'ll see what happens.\n\nSo next guess: tried\n\nBut note: the feedback also doesn\'t tell us if there are multiple occurrences? But for now, since we don\'t know, we\'ll assume no repeats until proven otherwise? But not necessary.\n\nAnother idea: What about ""GRUEL""? G R U E L? Then R in position 2, E in position 4? Letters G, R, U, E, L -> new: G, U, L.\n\nBut maybe T and S are more common? Not necessarily.\n\nI\'ll go with tried.\n\nIn summary:\n- Secret word has R in position 2.\n- Contains E somewhere not position 5 (so positions 1,3,4)\n- Does not contain C, A, N\n\nGuess: triedBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- R is in the secret word and in the correct position (second letter).  \n- E is in the secret word but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 1, 3, or 4).  \n- C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must include E but not in position 5, so position 1, 3, or 4.  \n- Must have R in position 2.  \n- Exclude C, A, and N.  \n- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., T, I, D) to gather more information.  \n\nThe word ""tried"" fits:  \n- T in position 1 tests a common consonant.  \n- R in position 2 (confirmed).  \n- I in position 3 tests a common vowel.  \n- E in position 4 (tests the misplaced E from previous feedback).  \n- D in position 5 tests another common consonant.  \n\nThis guess maximizes new letter coverage while honoring known constraints.\n\n<guess>tried</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tried -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C: not in word (x)\n- R: correct position (✓) at position 2\n- A: not in word (x)\n- N: not in word (x)\n- E: in word but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5\n\nSecond guess: ""tried""\n- T: not in word (x)\n- R: correct position (✓) at position 2 (as before)\n- I: not in word (x)\n- E: correct position (✓) at position 4?

E ?\n\nWe need a letter for position 3 and 5. Position 3 cannot be any of the excluded, and position 5 cannot be D (but D is at 1, so position 5 is free).\n\nBut we don\'t know if D is at 1 or not.\n\nSimilarly, if D is at position 3: _ R D E _\n\nWe need to fill position 1 and 5.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has D in position 1 to test that, and also include other new letters.\n\nFor example, ""drove"": D R O V E? But E is at position 5? Our pattern has E at position 4, so ""drove"" is D R O V E -> positions: D(1), R(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). But we need E at position 4, so this doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe must have E at position 4.\n\nSo pattern: _ R _ E _\n\nSo for position 3, it can be a letter, and position 5 a letter.\n\nIf we put D in position 1: D R ? E ?\n\nThen we need a word like ""DRUPE"" (a fruit) -> D R U P E? But E is at position 5? We need E at position 4, so in ""DRUPE"", it would be D(1), R(2), U(3), P(4), E(5). But position 4 is P, not E? So that doesn\'t have E at position 4.\n\nWe must have the pattern: letter1, R, letter3, E, letter5.\n\nSo for example, ""DRIED"": D R I E D? But I is excluded (from guess2: I(x)), and also D at position 5? But we know D is not at position 5? And I is not in the word.\n\nInvalid.\n\n""DRONE"": D R O N E? But N is excluded (from guess1: N(x)), and E is at position 5? Not 4.\n\nNot matching pattern.\n\nWe need E at position 4, so the fifth letter is separate.\n\nExamples of words: \n- ""BREDE""? Not common.\n- ""CREPE"": but C is excluded.\n- ""FREED"": F R E E D? But E at position 3 and 4? Pattern: F(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). But we have E at position 4? Yes, but also at 3? And D at 5? But we know D is not at position 5? From feedback, D(-) in position 5, so D is not at 5. But in ""FREED"", D is at 5? So if we guess ""FREED"", D at 5 would be wrong? But we know D is not at 5, so it would get a ""-"" for D? But we are trying to find the word.\n\nBut let\'s think of words that fit the pattern and have E at 4.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""PRIDE"": P R I D E? But I is excluded (I(x) from guess2), and E at position 5? Not 4.\n- ""BRIDE"": B R I D E? Same issue, I excluded and E at 5.\n- ""TRADE"": T R A D E? T and A excluded, and E at 5.\n- ""GRACE"": G R A C E? A and C excluded.\n\nNot working.\n\nHow about ""DROVE"": D R O V E? E at 5, not 4.\n\nWe need the fourth letter to be E.\n\nList of words ending with E? But we have E at position 4, so the word ends with something else.\n\nPattern: _ R _ E X, where X is the last letter.\n\nFor example:\n- ""GRAPE"": G R A P E? A excluded, and E at 5? Not 4.\n- ""GRIME"": G R I M E? I excluded, E at 5.\n- ""GROVE"": G R O V E? E at 5.\n\nNot matching.\n\nPerhaps ""URBEX""? Not a word.\n\nAnother idea: ""DWELL"" but no E at position 4.\n\nWe need to have E at position 4.\n\nLet\'s think: words like ""HAREM"" but H A R E M? A excluded, and E at position 4? H(1), A(2)? But we need R at position 2.\n\nPosition 2 is R, so it must be: ? R ? E ?\n\nSo ""HAREM"" would be H A R E M -> positions: 1:H, 2:A? But we need 2:R, so not.\n\n""BREME""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps ""DRUSE"": D R U S E? E at position 5? D(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). But position 4 is S, not E.\n\nWe need position 4 to be E.\n\nSo the word must be: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]\n\nFor example, ""WRITE"": W R I T E? But I and T excluded (T(x) from guess2, I(x) from guess2), and E at position 5? Not 4.\n\n""CRWTH""? Not a word.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAnother common word: ""PROSE"": P R O S E? E at position 5? Not 4.\n\n""ROUSE"": R O U S E? But position 1 is R? We need position 2 to be R, so position 1 must be something else.\n\n""AROSE"": A R O S E? A excluded, and E at 5.\n\nNot.\n\nPerhaps we should consider that D might be in position 3.\n\nSo pattern: _ R D E _\n\nThen we need to fill position 1 and 5.\n\nPosition 1: cannot be C, A, N, T, I.\nPosition 5: cannot be D, and not C, A, N, T, I.\n\nAlso, the word must contain D, which it does at position 3.\n\nExamples:\n- ""URDE_"" ? Not a word.\n- ""BRDEN"" not a word.\n- ""GRADE"": G R A D E? A excluded, and E at 5? Not 4.\n- ""CRUDE"": C R U D E? C excluded, E at 5.\n- ""PRUDE"": P R U D E? E at 5.\n- ""DRUPE"": D R U P E? But D is at position 1, not 3.\n\nFor D at position 3: the word is ? R D E ?\n\nSo ""PRUDE"" is P R U D E -> positions: P(1), R(2), U(3), D(4), E(5). But we need E at position 4? Here position 4 is D, not E.\n\nWe need position 4 to be E, so in this case, for D at position 3, the word would be: position 1: ?, position 2: R, position 3: D, position 4: E, position 5: ?\n\nSo like ""? R D E ?""\n\nExamples: \n- ""URDE_"" not a word.\n- ""ARDEC"" not a word.\n- ""BRD E"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""BREAD"": B R E A D? But E is at position 3, not 4? B(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). But we need E at position 4, so position 4 is A, not E.\n\nNot matching.\n\nMaybe it\'s not a common word? Or we are missing something.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps ""D"" is in position 1, and we have a word like ""DREGS""? But ""DREGS"" is D R E G S -> positions: D(1), R(2), E(3), G(4), S(5). But we need E at position 4? Here position 4 is G, not E.\n\nNot.\n\n""DRESS"": D R E S S -> D(1), R(2), E(3), S(4), S(5). Position 4 is S, not E.\n\nWe need position 4 to be E.\n\nLet\'s list words that have the pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]\n\nAnd the third letter is not fixed.\n\nFor example:\n- ""TRUCE"": T R U C E? T and C excluded, E at 5.\n- ""GROPE"": G R O P E? E at 5.\n- ""WRECK"": W R E C K? C excluded, and E at position 3, not 4.\n- ""BREAK"": B R E A K? A excluded, E at 3.\n\nPerhaps ""GREBE"": G R E B E? But E at position 3 and 5, and position 4 is B? G(1), R(2), E(3), B(4), E(5). So position 4 is B, not E.\n\nNot.\n\n""FREMD"": not a word.\n\nI think I found one: ""BREDE"" is a word? It means a breed or something, but not common.\n\n""CREDO"": C R E D O? C excluded, and E at position 3, not 4.\n\nPosition 3 is E in many cases, but we need position 4 to be E.\n\nAnother one: ""ARET E"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""Oread"" but it\'s 5 letters? O R E A D? O(1), R(2), E(3), A(4), D(5). A excluded, and E at 3.\n\nNot.\n\nLet\'s think differently. We know the word has R at 2, E at 4, and D is present but not at 5, so at 1 or 3.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, E was not at 5, which is consistent.\n\nNow, for our guess, we can try to put D in position 1 to test that.\n\nSo guess: D R ? E ?\n\nBut what to put for position 3 and 5.\n\nPosition 3: we can put a common letter not excluded, like S, O, U, L, etc.\n\nPosition 5: similarly.\n\nFor example, ""DRUSE"" but E at 5? Not.\n\nWe need position 4 to be E, so position 5 is a different letter.\n\nSo ""DR?E?"" with the fourth letter E.\n\nFor example, ""DRUZE"": D R U Z E? E at position 5? D(1), R(2), U(3), Z(4), E(5). Position 4 is Z, not E.\n\nNot.\n\n""DRIVE"": D R I V E? I excluded, E at 5.\n\nNot.\n\n""DRONE"": D R O N E? N excluded, E at 5.\n\nNot.\n\n""DRAPE"": D R A P E? A excluded, E at 5.\n\nNot.\n\nPerhaps ""DROME"": D R O M E? E at position 5? D(1), R(2), O(3), M(4), E(5). Position 4 is M, not E.\n\nBut we need position 4 to be E, so in the guess, we are not putting E at 4? No, for the secret word, position 4 is E, but in our guess, we can have different letters.\n\nFor our guess, we are trying to find a word that has the pattern with R at 2 and E at 4, and includes D somewhere.\n\nSo for the guess, we can have: position 2: R, position 4: E, and then position 1,3,5 to be filled, with D in one of 1,3, or 5? But D cannot be at 5, so 1 or 3.\n\nAnd avoid C,A,N,T,I.\n\nSo let\'s list possible words:\n\n- If D at 1: D R ? E ?\n  - Need a letter for 3 and 5.\n  - Words: ""DROME"" -> D R O M E? But position 4 is M? No, in ""DROME"", it\'s D-R-O-M-E, so position 4 is M, not E. We need the guess to have E at position 4, so the guess must have E as the fourth letter.\n\nThe guess must be a 5-letter word with R at position 2 and E at position 4.\n\nFor example, ""IRATE"" has R at position 2? I R A T E -> position 2 is R, position 4 is T, not E.\n\n""OPERA"": O P E R A? Position 2 is P, not R.\n\nWe need position 2 to be R and position 4 to be E.\n\nSo the guess pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]\n\nAnd the word must contain D, which is not at position 5, so in position 1 or 3.\n\nAlso, the letters at 1,3,5 must not be C,A,N,T,I.\n\nLet\'s search for words that match [letter] R [letter] E [letter]\n\nFor example:\n- ""URBAN"" but position 4 is A, not E.\n- ""ARISE"": A R I S E? A and I excluded, position 4 is S, not E.\n- ""TRICE"": T R I C E? T,I,C excluded, position 4 is C, not E.\n- ""GRACE"": G R A C E? A,C excluded, position 4 is C, not E.\n- ""BRUTE"": B R U T E? T excluded, position 4 is T, not E.\n- ""PRIME"": P R I M E? I excluded, position 4 is M, not E.\n- ""CRANE"": already guessed, and C,A,N excluded.\n- ""FRAME"": F R A M E? A excluded, position 4 is M, not E.\n- ""GRAZE"": G R A Z E? A excluded, position 4 is Z, not E.\n- ""DRAKE"": D R A K E? A excluded, position 4 is K, not E.\n- ""WRITE"": W R I T E? I,T excluded, position 4 is T, not E.\n\nI\'m not finding many with E at position 4.\n\nAnother one: ""TROVE"": T R O V E? T excluded, position 4 is V, not E.\n\n""PROBE"": P R O B E? Position 4 is B, not E.\n\n""ROGUE"": R O G U E? Position 1 is R? We need position 2 to be R, so position 1 must be different. ""ROGUE"" has R at 1, not 2.\n\n""AROSE"": A R O S E? A excluded, position 4 is S, not E.\n\n""ERASE"": E R A S E? A excluded, position 4 is S, not E.\n\n""CRISP"": C R I S P? C,I excluded, position 4 is S, not E.\n\nPerhaps ""GREBE"": G R E B E? Position 3 is E, not 4.\n\nI think I have a mistake: position 4 means the fourth letter.\n\nIn ""GREBE"", it\'s G-R-E-B-E, so position 1:G, 2:R, 3:E, 4:B, 5:E. So position 4 is B.\n\nWe need a word where the fourth letter is E.\n\nFor example, ""AXIOM"" not.\n\n""OLEUM"" not.\n\n""QUEUE"" not.\n\n""ADIEU"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""SPREE"": S P R E E? Position 2 is P, not R.\n\n""TREES"": T R E E S? Position 2 is R, position 3 is E, position 4 is E? T(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), S(5). Yes, position 4 is E.\n\nAnd it has R at position 2.\n\nBut does it contain D? ""TREES"" has T,R,E,E,S. No D.\n\nBut we know D is in the word, so we must include D in the guess or at least not contradict.\n\nBut in ""TREES"", there is no D, but the secret word has D, so if we guess ""TREES"", it would not have D, so the feedback for D would be missing, but we know D is in the word, so ""TREES"" cannot be the secret word because it lacks D.\n\nSo we can guess it to test, but it\'s not the secret word.\n\nBut we need to include D in our guess to gather information about its position.\n\nSo for our guess, we should include D.\n\nBack to the pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter]\n\nWith D in position 1 or 3.\n\nPosition 3 is the third letter.\n\nSo if D in position 1: D R ? E ?\n\nThen the third letter can be, say, U, and fifth letter S: ""DRUES""? Not a word.\n\nD R O E S? ""DROES""? Not common, but ""DOES"" is 4 letters.\n\n""DRUES"" not a word.\n\nD R U E S? ""DRUES"" not recognized.\n\nD R S E L? ""DRSEL"" not.\n\nIf D in position 3: ? R D E ?\n\nFor example, ""URDEA"" not.\n\n""BRD E"" not.\n\n""CRDEN"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""ARD EB"" not.\n\nI think ""BREAD"" but position 4 is A, not E.\n\nAnother idea: ""GRUED"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""PREDY"" not.\n\nLet\'s consider that D might be in position 1, and use a word like ""DREED"": D R E E D? But position 3 is E, not the fourth. D(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). Position 4 is E, yes.\n\nAnd it has D at position 1 and 5.\n\nBut we know D is not at position 5 from previous feedback? In guess2, D was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning D is in the word but not at position 5. So in ""DREED"", if we put D at position 5, it would be wrong, but we know that, so it\'s okay for the guess, but the secret word won\'t have D at 5.\n\nBut ""DREED"" has E at position 3 and 4, and D at 1 and 5.\n\nBut position 4 is E, good.\n\nBut letters: D, R, E, E, D.\n\nBut we have T and I excluded, but E is allowed.\n\nBut is ""DREED"" a word? It might be a variant or rare.\n\nCommonly, ""breed"" is used, but ""dreed"" is not standard.\n\nPerhaps ""freed"" but F R E E D, position 2 is R, position 4 is E? F(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5). Yes, position 4 is E.\n\nAnd ""freed"" is a word.\n\nBut it has D at position 5, which we know is not correct for D, so in the feedback, D at 5 will get a ""-"", but that\'s fine for the guess.\n\nAlso, it has F at position 1, which is new.\n\nAnd no C,A,N,T,I.\n\nSo ""freed"" could be a guess: F R E E D.\n\nBut position 3 is E, and position 4 is E, so two E\'s.\n\nBut the secret word has E at position 4, and we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if there are multiple E\'s.\n\nIn ""freed"", we have E at position 3 and 4.\n\nBut in the feedback, for position 3, if it\'s not E in the secret word, it might show something.\n\nBut let\'s see the secret word pattern: _ R _ E _\n\nIf we guess ""freed"", it would be:\n\nPosition 1: F\nPosition 2: R (correct)\nPosition 3: E\nPosition 4: E (correct, because secret has E at 4)\nPosition 5: D\n\nNow, for position 3: if the secret word has E at position 3, it would be correct, but we don\'t know. If not, it might be absent or misplaced.\n\nBut we know the secret word has E at position 4, but it might not have E at position 3.\n\nAlso, D at position 5 will be wrong, but we know D is in the word, so it will show ""-"" for D.\n\nBut we want to test where D is.\n\nPerhaps a better guess would be to put D in position 1 or 3.\n\nFor example, ""deare"" but not common, and A excluded.\n\nAnother word: ""berth"" but no E at 4.\n\nI think ""freed"" is acceptable as a guess.\n\nBut let\'s find a word with D in position 1.\n\nFor example, ""duvet"" but no R at 2.\n\nWith R at 2 and E at 4: ""dr e at the 4th"".\n\n"" D R ? E ? ""\n\n""Drube"" not a word.\n\n""Drone"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""dhole"" but H O L E, not E at 4.\n\nI found one: ""dicey"" not.\n\nAnother one: ""dizen"" has N.\n\nNot.\n\nPerhaps ""broke"" not.\n\nLet\'s give up and use ""freed"" or find another.\n\nWhat about ""greed"": G R E E D? Same as ""freed"", with G at 1.\n\nG is new.\n\n""Greed"": G R E E D.\n\nPosition 2: R (correct), position 4: E (correct), position 1: G, position 3: E, position 5: D.\n\nAnd D at 5 will be ""-"", but we know.\n\nBut we can test G and the position of E at 3.\n\nBut the secret word may not have E at 3.\n\nAnother word: ""breed"" B R E E D, but B is new.\n\nBut ""breed"" has B at 1.\n\nOr ""treed"" T R E E D, but T is excluded.\n\nT is excluded, so cannot use T.\n\nT is not in the word, so ""treed"" has T, invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""creed"" has C, excluded.\n\nSo ""freed"" or ""greed"" or ""dreed"" (rare).\n\nLet\'s use ""greed"": G R E E D.\n\nBut we can do better.\n\nAnother idea: since D is in the word and not at 5, and must be at 1 or 3, we can try a word that has D at position 1 and a new letter at 3 and 5.\n\nFor example, ""dusky"" but no R at 2.\n\nWith the pattern, ""dr e at 4"", so ""d?r?e?"".\n\n""DUREE"" not a word.\n\n"" DURED"" D U R E D? But position 2 is U, not R.\n\nNot.\n\n"" D R U E D"" not 5 letters.\n\nI think we have to accept that for position 3, we can use a vowel or common consonant.\n\nLet\'s use ""greed"" as a guess.\n\nBut ""greed"" has E at position 3, which might not be in the secret word, and we might get information.\n\nSimilarly, position 1 G.\n\nSo guess: greed\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback from guess2: for ""tried"", E was at position 4 and it was correct, so in the secret word, position 4 is E.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for the next guess, I\'ll go with ""greed"".\n\n<guess>greed</guess>\n\nBut we have to output in the format.\n\nPerhaps there\'s a better word.\n\nAnother common word: ""price"" but C and I excluded.\n\n""Brume"" not.\n\n""Frame"" A excluded.\n\nI think ""greed"" is fine.\n\nSo:Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)  \n  - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).  \n  - E is in the secret word but not in position 5.  \n  - C, A, and N are not in the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: tried** → Feedback: T(x) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(-)  \n  - R (position 2) and E (position 4) are confirmed correct.  \n  - D is in the secret word but not in position 5.  \n  - T and I are not in the secret word.  \n\n### Key Constraints for the Next Guess:\n- **Positions**:  \n  - Position 2 must be R.  \n  - Position 4 must be E.  \n- **Included Letters**:  \n  - D must be in the word, but not in position 5 (so it must be in position 1 or 3).  \n- **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, T, I (not in the word).  \n- **Unknowns**:  \n  - Position 1, 3, and 5 need to be filled with new letters.  \n  - D\'s exact position (1 or 3) is unknown.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test D in position 1 to gather information (since it cannot be in position 5).  \n- Cover new common letters (e.g., G, S, L, O) to maximize information gain.  \n- Avoid excluded letters (C, A, N, T, I).  \n- The word must fit the pattern: [letter] R [letter] E [letter].  \n\nThe word **""greed""** is chosen because:  \n- It has R in position 2 and E in position 4 (matching known positions).  \n- It tests D in position 5 (which is known to be incorrect, but this will confirm D\'s absence there and may provide feedback on other positions).  \n- It introduces G (position 1) and a double E (position 3), which tests for the presence of G and potential duplicate E.  \n- It avoids all excluded letters.  \n\nThis guess will help clarify:  \n- If G is in the word and its position.  \n- If E is also in position 3 (via feedback).  \n- D\'s status (though position 5 is known wrong, feedback may reveal if D is elsewhere).\n\n<guess>greed</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tried -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) E(✓) D(-)\nGuess 3: greed -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) E(-) E(✓) D(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in position 2.
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

**Guess 2: tried**
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in position 2 (confirmed).
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 4.
- D(-) → D is in the word but not in position 5.

**Guess 3: greed**
- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in position 2 (confirmed).
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 3? Wait, let's see the positions:
  - greed: G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5)
- Feedback: G(x), R(✓), E(-), E(✓), D(-)
  - First E (position 3): got (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 3.
  - Second E (position 4): got (✓), which matches previous knowledge that E is in position 4.
  - D (position 5): got (-), meaning D is in the word but not in position 5. This is consistent with the previous feedback.

### Summary of known information:
- **R** is fixed in **position 2**.
- **E** is fixed in **position 4**.
- **D** is in the word, but **not in position 5** (and now also not in position 3? Wait, not exactly: the feedback for greed shows D(-) at position 5, and E(-) at position 3. But E at position 3 got (-), meaning that E is in the word but not at position 3. Since we already know E is at position 4, this (-) for position 3 might indicate that there is another E? But the feedback symbol for a repeated letter can be tricky. Alternatively, it could be that the word has only one E? But the feedback for the first E at position 3 is (-), which means that either the secret word has an E but not at position 3, which we already know because position 4 is E. But if there is only one E, then when we put E at position 3, it should be ('x') because that E is already used at position 4? Wait, no: in Wordle rules for repeated letters, if there are two E's, then both can be considered. But if there is only one E, then guessing two E's will show one of them as correct or misplaced and the other as absent? Actually, the rules state that the feedback is per letter but can be tricky with duplicates. Let's clarify.

But looking at the feedback for ""greed"": 
- The E at position 3 got (-), meaning that E is in the word but not in position 3. Since we have E at position 4 (which got ✓), that means the E at position 3 is additional? Or the secret word has at least two E's? But the (-) for position 3 implies that there is another instance of E in the word that is not at position 3. That other instance is at position 4. So the secret word has exactly one E? And we are misplacing the first E by putting it at position 3? However, the feedback for a duplicate: 
  - Suppose the secret word has one E at position 4. Then when we guess ""greed"":
    - Position 3: E is not in the word at that position, but since E is at position 4, we get a (-) for position 3? That would be misleading because the E at position 3 is not the same instance? The rules might mark the E at position 3 as (-) because E is present but not at position 3, while the E at position 4 is correct (✓). So only one E is in the secret word.

Similarly, for D: we got D(-) at position 5, so D is in the word but not at position 5.

From this feedback, we learned:
- G is not in the word.
- E is not at position 3 (which we already expected, but now confirmed).
- D is not at position 5 (again, consistent).
- Moreover, the E at position 4 is confirmed again.

But the key new information: 
1. E is not in position 3. But we knew that E is at position 4, so naturally E cannot be at position 3 if there is only one E? Or the secret word has two E's? The feedback for position 3 E got (-) means that there is an E in the word that is not at position 3. And since we have a correct E at position 4, that satisfies the condition. So it doesn't necessarily mean two E's; it might mean that the E we guessed at position 3 is the same E that is at position 4? But the standard Wordle rule is that if a letter appears once in the secret word and is guessed twice, one instance can be marked as misplaced or correct and the other as not in the word? But here the feedback is E(-) at 3 and E(✓) at 4, which implies that both E's are acknowledged: one is misplaced (but actually it might be the same letter? Confusing).

To avoid confusion, let's note that the secret word might or might not have two E's. However, since we have E(✓) at position 4 and E(-) at position 3, it suggests that the secret word has at least one E (at position 4) but there is no additional E at position 3? Actually, no: it says E is in the word but not at position 3. That doesn't preclude another E elsewhere. But we don't know.

For now, we'll proceed with what we know for sure.

### Current constraints:
- Secret word pattern: [ ? ] R [ ? ] E [ ? ]
- Known letters in word: R, E, D.
- D must be in the word but not in positions 3 (from guess3: E in position 3 got (-), but D might be at position 1 or 3? But not at 5 or 3? Wait, the E(-) at position 3 is for E, not D. The D feedback was at position 5: D(-), meaning D not at position 5.

So D is in the word, but not at position 5. It can be at position 1 or 3. The position 3 feedback was for E, not D. So D could be at position 1 or 3.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, G (from this guess).

Previously excluded: C, A, N, T, I (from guess1 and 2) and now G is also excluded.

So excluded: C, A, N, T, I, G.

Letters to consider: B, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc. 

We also need to include D in the guess since we know it is in the word.

We can structure the next guess as:
- Fixed: position 2 = R, position 4 = E.
- D must be at position 1 or 3 (since not at 5 and not at 3? Wait, position 3 is available for D? But position 3 was the E in guess3? No, D is a different letter.

So for position 1,3,5: we need to place letters, including D.

Possible approaches:
1. Put D at position 1 to test if it's correct there.
2. Put D at position 3 to test.
3. Or cover new common letters.

Since we have limited tries, it's efficient to test D at position 1.

So possible word: D R ? E ?

For position 3 and 5, choose common letters not excluded.

For example, ""drove"": D, R, O, V, E? But E at position 5? Pattern requires position 4 to be E? Not ""drove"", which is D,R,O,V,E.

Secret pattern is _ R _ E _ , so the fifth letter is unknown.

In ""drove"", positions: 1:D, 2:R, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E → position 4 is V, not E.

We must keep position 4 as E. So the word must have E at position 4.

So for a guess:
- Position 1: D (to test D)
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: a letter, say S
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: another letter, say T? But T is excluded.

T is excluded, so not T.

Position 3: S or O, etc.
Position 5: H, L, P, etc.

Word: ""DRU E P""? ""drupe"" is D R U P E → D(1),R(2),U(3),P(4),E(5). But we need E at position 4? Position 4 is P.

Not.

""DRESE"" not a word.

 ""D R O E M"" → ""drome"" is D R O M E? Then position 4 is M.

Not.

Perhaps ""drees"": D R E E S? But then positions: D(1),R(2),E(3),E(4),S(5). So position 4 is E (good). And this includes D at position 1.

Also, E at position 3 — but in the feedback, if we guess ""drees"", we might learn more about E.

However, we already know E at position 3 is not in the secret word? From guess3 ""greed"", we had E(-) at position 3. So if we put E at position 3 again, it might not be efficient. Better to avoid E at position 3.

Similarly, we want to test new letters.

Alternative: use a word with D at position 1, and new letters at position 3 and 5.

Example: ""DRUSE"" → D R U S E, but position 4 is S, not E.

Not matching.

The word must be: [D] at 1, R at 2, [new letter] at 3, E at 4, [new letter] at 5.

For example, ""drape"" has A and E at 5. Not.

""DRIPE"" — not a word (maybe), but I is excluded.

""DRONE"" — N is excluded.

""DRIVE"" — I excluded.

""DRBLE"" not.

Possible words:
- ""dulse"" — not, and position 4 not E.
- ""douse"" — O U S E, pattern: D(1),O(2)? Not R at 2.

Not.

Another: ""dwine"" not.

Perhaps ""demur"" not matching pattern.

Given the constraints, let's try D at position 3 instead.

Then secret-like: [letter] R D E [letter]

For the guess: we can use a word that has R at 2, E at 4, and D at 3.

So pattern: ? R D E ?

For example, ""URDE "" not.

""PRDE"" not.

""BRD E"" not.

Common words? ""pride"" has I and E at 4? P R I D E? Position 4 is D, not E.

Not.

""grade"" has A and E at 5.

Not.

But there is ""ardeb"" not common.

Perhaps ""ordeal"" too long.

I think ""bride"" but I and E at 5.

Not.

Let me search for words. How about ""tilde"" not R at 2.

Another idea: ""timer"" not.

Perhaps ""payer"" not.

I found one: ""UREDO"" — U R E D O? Position 2 is R, yes; position 4 is D? U(1),R(2),E(3),D(4),O(5). Not E at 4.

Not.

""FREED"" we used ""greed"", which is similar.

But let's consider ""breed"" — B R E E D — with D at 5? And E at position 3? But we know D not at 5 and E not at 3? Still, we might guess it, but B is not tested.

But we know D not at 5 and E not at 3? Not necessarily we know about position 1.

With excluded letters: C,A,N,T,I,G.

Possible words: ""freed"" was used similarly.

Another word: ""sreed"" not a word.

""shred"" — S H R E D? Position 2 is H? S(1),H(2),R(3),E(4),D(5). Position 3 is R? But we need position 2 to be R, so position 1 should be such that position 2 is R. In ""shred"", position 2 is H.

Not.

Let's try different approach: Guess a word that has D at position 1, E at position 4, and common letters in 3 and 5.

For example, with position 3: O, position 5: S -> ""droes"" not common.

""doles"" not.

""duces"" not and C excluded.

""dames"" A and E position 5? Not.

Perhaps ""dines"" I and N excluded.

Not.

""dopes"" D O P E S? But pattern: D(1),O(2),P(3),E(4),S(5). So position 2 is O, not R.

Not.

The challenge is to have position 2 fixed as R.

So we need to choose words that start with any letter, have R as the second letter, then any letter, then E as the fourth letter, then any letter.

With D in the word, either at 1 or 3.

For position 3, if we put a letter other than D, and put D at 1, etc.

Word candidate: ""drake"" but A and K? And E at 5.

Not.

""drone"" N and E at 5.

Not.

""drupe"" D R U P E? Then position 4 is P, not E.

Unless we have position 4 as E? ""drupe"" is not.

Another word: ""adobe"" not R at 2.

Perhaps ""arede"" not common and A excluded.

I think a valid word is ""defer"" D E F E R? But position 2 is E, not R; and no E at 4? D(1),E(2),F(3),E(4),R(5). Position 2 is E, not R. Not.

 ""deare"" rejected.

We might need to use a word that has the pattern and includes D.

Consider ""breds"" but not with E at 4.

Let's list common words that match the pattern _ R _ E _

For example: 
- ""crime"" — C and I excluded.
- ""write"" — T and I excluded.
- ""prime"" — I excluded.
- ""tripe"" — T and I excluded.
- ""bride"" — I excluded.
- ""crete"" — C excluded.
- ""grate"" — T and A? G excluded? G is excluded, and A excluded.
- ""brace"" — C and A excluded.
- ""trace"" — T,C,A excluded.
- ""grike"" — rare.

All have issues.

Another: ""prose"" — P R O S E? Position 4 is S, not E.

""arise"" — A and I excluded.

""urase"" rare.

"" trice"" T and C and I.

Not.

Perhaps ""ELUDE"" — E L U D E? Position 2 is L, not R.

Not.

Maybe ""EROSE"" — E R O S E? Position 1 is E, position 4 is S, not E.

Not.

I recall that ""puree"" P U R E E? Position 2 is U, not R.

Not.

""GRECE"" G excluded and not E at 4? G R E C E? Position 4 is C.

Not.

Perhaps we can use a word like ""droop"" not having E.

Given the difficulty, let's consider that D might be at position 1, and use ""driven"" but 6 letters.

5 letters: ""drive"" has I and E at 5.

Not.

Another solution: ""fired"" has I and E at 5.

Not.

Perhaps ""rared"" rare, and A excluded.

I think the only practical choice is to use a word that has D at position 1 and valid letters, even if it has E at position 3? But we can avoid that.

For example, ""dusky"" doesn't fit.

Let's try ""dwarf"" not.

""dogie"" not.

I found ""dhole"" — D H O L E? Position 4 is L? D(1),H(2),O(3),L(4),E(5). Not position 4 as E.

Not.

""drole"" not a word.

Perhaps ""duple"" not.

Let's choose ""drape"" even though it has A.

No, A is excluded.

Final attempt: ""druse"". We already said it doesn't work.

Maybe ""dreks"" not.

Perhaps I have to accept a word like ""breed"" but it has E at position 3 and B at 1, and we can guess that to confirm, but B is not excluded.

Of the excluded letters, B is not excluded.

So let's use ""breed"": B R E E D.

But B at position 1.

And E at position 3 and 4.

But we know from guess3 that E is not at position 3? The feedback E(-) at position 3 in "" greed"" for a different guess ""greed"" suggests that E is not at position 3. So guessing ""breed"" would have E at position 3 again, which should show as 'x' or '-'? It might be consistent.

But to avoid redundancy, perhaps use ""bread"" but A excluded.

Not.

"" blood"" not.

The word ""freed"" is already suspected.

Another word: ""deers"" but D E E R S not R at 2.

I think the best is to use ""pried"" for if D at position 5, but D not at 5.

Still not.

Let's think of ""dryer"" D R Y E R? D(1),R(2),Y(3),E(4),R(5). Yes! Position 4 is E.
- Pattern: D R Y E R
- 5 letters: ""dryer""
- Letters: D, R, Y, E, R (R repeating)
- Avoids excluded letters: C,A,N,T,I,G
- Includes D at position 1 (testing if D is at position 1)
- Introduces Y at position 3 and R at position 5 (but R at position 5 is a repeat)

This is a valid word.

Guess: ""dryer""

Feedback would show:
- Position 1: D (we want to see if D is correct here)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: Y
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R (repeat R)

If the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 5 might be marked as not in the word or misplaced? But we already have R at position 2.

Secret word has R at position 2, so position 5 R is additional.

But it's worth a try.

Another word: ""diker"" but I excluded.

Not.

""daker"" rare.

So I choose ""dryer"".

### Step-by-Step Thought Process

- **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
  - **Guess 1 (crane)**: 
    - R is correct and in position 2 (✓).
    - E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).
    - C, A, N are not in the word (x).
  - **Guess 2 (tried)**:
    - R is still correct in position 2 (✓).
    - E is now confirmed correct in position 4 (✓).
    - D is in the word but not in position 5 (-).
    - T and I are not in the word (x).
  - **Guess 3 (greed)**:
    - R (position 2) and E (position 4) remain correct (✓).
    - G is not in the word (x).
    - The first E (position 3) is in the word but not in position 3 (-), indicating E is present elsewhere (likely only at position 4).
    - D (position 5) is in the word but not in position 5 (-), consistent with prior feedback.
  
- **Summary of Known Information**:
  - **Secret word pattern**: Position 2 = R, Position 4 = E. So, the word is `_ R _ E _`.
  - **Confirmed letters**: R, E, D must be present.
    - D is not in position 5 (from `tried`), and likely not in position 1 or 3? The D feedback is separate from E's, so D can still be in position 1 or 3.
  - **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G (not in the secret word).
  - **Untested positions**: Positions 1, 3, and 5 need new letters. Priority is to test D's location (position 1 or 3) and cover common unused letters (e.g., S, L, O, P, U, Y).

- **Strategy for Guess 4**:
  - Test D at position 1 (since it cannot be in position 5 and hasn't been tested at position 1).
  - Cover new high-frequency letters like Y (position 3) and reuse R at position 5 for efficiency (repeats can reveal letter frequency).
  - Avoid excluded letters and ensure the word fits the pattern: `_ R _ E _`.

- **Word Selection**:
  - **""dryer""** fits the pattern (`D R Y E R`):
    - Position 1: D (test if D is correct here).
    - Position 2: R (✓ confirmed).
    - Position 3: Y (test new letter).
    - Position 4: E (✓ confirmed).
    - Position 5: R (test if R repeats, providing info on R frequency).
  - This tests D at position 1, uses Y (common consonanty), and adheres to known constraints.

- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - Feedback will clarify:
    - If D is at position 1 (✓ or x).
    - If Y is in the word and its position.
    - If R appears twice (via position 5 feedback).

<guess>dryer</guess>",dryer,"We are given the feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in the word and in position 2.
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- N(x) → N is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

**Guess 2: tried**
- T(x) → T is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in position 2 (confirmed).
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 4.
- D(-) → D is in the word but not in position 5.

**Guess 3: greed**
- G(x) → G is not in the word.
- R(✓) → R is in position 2 (confirmed).
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 3? Wait, let's see the positions:
  - greed: G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), D(5)
- Feedback: G(x), R(✓), E(-), E(✓), D(-)
  - First E (position 3): got (-), meaning E is in the word but not in position 3.
  - Second E (position 4): got (✓), which matches previous knowledge that E is in position 4.
  - D (position 5): got (-), meaning D is in the word but not in position 5. This is consistent with the previous feedback.

### Summary of known information:
- **R** is fixed in **position 2**.
- **E** is fixed in **position 4**.
- **D** is in the word, but **not in position 5** (and now also not in position 3? Wait, not exactly: the feedback for greed shows D(-) at position 5, and E(-) at position 3. But E at position 3 got (-), meaning that E is in the word but not at position 3. Since we already know E is at position 4, this (-) for position 3 might indicate that there is another E? But the feedback symbol for a repeated letter can be tricky. Alternatively, it could be that the word has only one E? But the feedback for the first E at position 3 is (-), which means that either the secret word has an E but not at position 3, which we already know because position 4 is E. But if there is only one E, then when we put E at position 3, it should be ('x') because that E is already used at position 4? Wait, no: in Wordle rules for repeated letters, if there are two E's, then both can be considered. But if there is only one E, then guessing two E's will show one of them as correct or misplaced and the other as absent? Actually, the rules state that the feedback is per letter but can be tricky with duplicates. Let's clarify.

But looking at the feedback for ""greed"": 
- The E at position 3 got (-), meaning that E is in the word but not in position 3. Since we have E at position 4 (which got ✓), that means the E at position 3 is additional? Or the secret word has at least two E's? But the (-) for position 3 implies that there is another instance of E in the word that is not at position 3. That other instance is at position 4. So the secret word has exactly one E? And we are misplacing the first E by putting it at position 3? However, the feedback for a duplicate: 
  - Suppose the secret word has one E at position 4. Then when we guess ""greed"":
    - Position 3: E is not in the word at that position, but since E is at position 4, we get a (-) for position 3? That would be misleading because the E at position 3 is not the same instance? The rules might mark the E at position 3 as (-) because E is present but not at position 3, while the E at position 4 is correct (✓). So only one E is in the secret word.

Similarly, for D: we got D(-) at position 5, so D is in the word but not at position 5.

From this feedback, we learned:
- G is not in the word.
- E is not at position 3 (which we already expected, but now confirmed).
- D is not at position 5 (again, consistent).
- Moreover, the E at position 4 is confirmed again.

But the key new information: 
1. E is not in position 3. But we knew that E is at position 4, so naturally E cannot be at position 3 if there is only one E? Or the secret word has two E's? The feedback for position 3 E got (-) means that there is an E in the word that is not at position 3. And since we have a correct E at position 4, that satisfies the condition. So it doesn't necessarily mean two E's; it might mean that the E we guessed at position 3 is the same E that is at position 4? But the standard Wordle rule is that if a letter appears once in the secret word and is guessed twice, one instance can be marked as misplaced or correct and the other as not in the word? But here the feedback is E(-) at 3 and E(✓) at 4, which implies that both E's are acknowledged: one is misplaced (but actually it might be the same letter? Confusing).

To avoid confusion, let's note that the secret word might or might not have two E's. However, since we have E(✓) at position 4 and E(-) at position 3, it suggests that the secret word has at least one E (at position 4) but there is no additional E at position 3? Actually, no: it says E is in the word but not at position 3. That doesn't preclude another E elsewhere. But we don't know.

For now, we'll proceed with what we know for sure.

### Current constraints:
- Secret word pattern: [ ? ] R [ ? ] E [ ? ]
- Known letters in word: R, E, D.
- D must be in the word but not in positions 3 (from guess3: E in position 3 got (-), but D might be at position 1 or 3? But not at 5 or 3? Wait, the E(-) at position 3 is for E, not D. The D feedback was at position 5: D(-), meaning D not at position 5.

So D is in the word, but not at position 5. It can be at position 1 or 3. The position 3 feedback was for E, not D. So D could be at position 1 or 3.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, I, G (from this guess).

Previously excluded: C, A, N, T, I (from guess1 and 2) and now G is also excluded.

So excluded: C, A, N, T, I, G.

Letters to consider: B, F, H, K, L, M, O, P, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, etc. 

We also need to include D in the guess since we know it is in the word.

We can structure the next guess as:
- Fixed: position 2 = R, position 4 = E.
- D must be at position 1 or 3 (since not at 5 and not at 3? Wait, position 3 is available for D? But position 3 was the E in guess3? No, D is a different letter.

So for position 1,3,5: we need to place letters, including D.

Possible approaches:
1. Put D at position 1 to test if it's correct there.
2. Put D at position 3 to test.
3. Or cover new common letters.

Since we have limited tries, it's efficient to test D at position 1.

So possible word: D R ? E ?

For position 3 and 5, choose common letters not excluded.

For example, ""drove"": D, R, O, V, E? But E at position 5? Pattern requires position 4 to be E? Not ""drove"", which is D,R,O,V,E.

Secret pattern is _ R _ E _ , so the fifth letter is unknown.

In ""drove"", positions: 1:D, 2:R, 3:O, 4:V, 5:E → position 4 is V, not E.

We must keep position 4 as E. So the word must have E at position 4.

So for a guess:
- Position 1: D (to test D)
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: a letter, say S
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: another letter, say T? But T is excluded.

T is excluded, so not T.

Position 3: S or O, etc.
Position 5: H, L, P, etc.

Word: ""DRU E P""? ""drupe"" is D R U P E → D(1),R(2),U(3),P(4),E(5). But we need E at position 4? Position 4 is P.

Not.

""DRESE"" not a word.

 ""D R O E M"" → ""drome"" is D R O M E? Then position 4 is M.

Not.

Perhaps ""drees"": D R E E S? But then positions: D(1),R(2),E(3),E(4),S(5). So position 4 is E (good). And this includes D at position 1.

Also, E at position 3 — but in the feedback, if we guess ""drees"", we might learn more about E.

However, we already know E at position 3 is not in the secret word? From guess3 ""greed"", we had E(-) at position 3. So if we put E at position 3 again, it might not be efficient. Better to avoid E at position 3.

Similarly, we want to test new letters.

Alternative: use a word with D at position 1, and new letters at position 3 and 5.

Example: ""DRUSE"" → D R U S E, but position 4 is S, not E.

Not matching.

The word must be: [D] at 1, R at 2, [new letter] at 3, E at 4, [new letter] at 5.

For example, ""drape"" has A and E at 5. Not.

""DRIPE"" — not a word (maybe), but I is excluded.

""DRONE"" — N is excluded.

""DRIVE"" — I excluded.

""DRBLE"" not.

Possible words:
- ""dulse"" — not, and position 4 not E.
- ""douse"" — O U S E, pattern: D(1),O(2)? Not R at 2.

Not.

Another: ""dwine"" not.

Perhaps ""demur"" not matching pattern.

Given the constraints, let's try D at position 3 instead.

Then secret-like: [letter] R D E [letter]

For the guess: we can use a word that has R at 2, E at 4, and D at 3.

So pattern: ? R D E ?

For example, ""URDE "" not.

""PRDE"" not.

""BRD E"" not.

Common words? ""pride"" has I and E at 4? P R I D E? Position 4 is D, not E.

Not.

""grade"" has A and E at 5.

Not.

But there is ""ardeb"" not common.

Perhaps ""ordeal"" too long.

I think ""bride"" but I and E at 5.

Not.

Let me search for words. How about ""tilde"" not R at 2.

Another idea: ""timer"" not.

Perhaps ""payer"" not.

I found one: ""UREDO"" — U R E D O? Position 2 is R, yes; position 4 is D? U(1),R(2),E(3),D(4),O(5). Not E at 4.

Not.

""FREED"" we used ""greed"", which is similar.

But let's consider ""breed"" — B R E E D — with D at 5? And E at position 3? But we know D not at 5 and E not at 3? Still, we might guess it, but B is not tested.

But we know D not at 5 and E not at 3? Not necessarily we know about position 1.

With excluded letters: C,A,N,T,I,G.

Possible words: ""freed"" was used similarly.

Another word: ""sreed"" not a word.

""shred"" — S H R E D? Position 2 is H? S(1),H(2),R(3),E(4),D(5). Position 3 is R? But we need position 2 to be R, so position 1 should be such that position 2 is R. In ""shred"", position 2 is H.

Not.

Let's try different approach: Guess a word that has D at position 1, E at position 4, and common letters in 3 and 5.

For example, with position 3: O, position 5: S -> ""droes"" not common.

""doles"" not.

""duces"" not and C excluded.

""dames"" A and E position 5? Not.

Perhaps ""dines"" I and N excluded.

Not.

""dopes"" D O P E S? But pattern: D(1),O(2),P(3),E(4),S(5). So position 2 is O, not R.

Not.

The challenge is to have position 2 fixed as R.

So we need to choose words that start with any letter, have R as the second letter, then any letter, then E as the fourth letter, then any letter.

With D in the word, either at 1 or 3.

For position 3, if we put a letter other than D, and put D at 1, etc.

Word candidate: ""drake"" but A and K? And E at 5.

Not.

""drone"" N and E at 5.

Not.

""drupe"" D R U P E? Then position 4 is P, not E.

Unless we have position 4 as E? ""drupe"" is not.

Another word: ""adobe"" not R at 2.

Perhaps ""arede"" not common and A excluded.

I think a valid word is ""defer"" D E F E R? But position 2 is E, not R; and no E at 4? D(1),E(2),F(3),E(4),R(5). Position 2 is E, not R. Not.

 ""deare"" rejected.

We might need to use a word that has the pattern and includes D.

Consider ""breds"" but not with E at 4.

Let's list common words that match the pattern _ R _ E _

For example: 
- ""crime"" — C and I excluded.
- ""write"" — T and I excluded.
- ""prime"" — I excluded.
- ""tripe"" — T and I excluded.
- ""bride"" — I excluded.
- ""crete"" — C excluded.
- ""grate"" — T and A? G excluded? G is excluded, and A excluded.
- ""brace"" — C and A excluded.
- ""trace"" — T,C,A excluded.
- ""grike"" — rare.

All have issues.

Another: ""prose"" — P R O S E? Position 4 is S, not E.

""arise"" — A and I excluded.

""urase"" rare.

"" trice"" T and C and I.

Not.

Perhaps ""ELUDE"" — E L U D E? Position 2 is L, not R.

Not.

Maybe ""EROSE"" — E R O S E? Position 1 is E, position 4 is S, not E.

Not.

I recall that ""puree"" P U R E E? Position 2 is U, not R.

Not.

""GRECE"" G excluded and not E at 4? G R E C E? Position 4 is C.

Not.

Perhaps we can use a word like ""droop"" not having E.

Given the difficulty, let's consider that D might be at position 1, and use ""driven"" but 6 letters.

5 letters: ""drive"" has I and E at 5.

Not.

Another solution: ""fired"" has I and E at 5.

Not.

Perhaps ""rared"" rare, and A excluded.

I think the only practical choice is to use a word that has D at position 1 and valid letters, even if it has E at position 3? But we can avoid that.

For example, ""dusky"" doesn't fit.

Let's try ""dwarf"" not.

""dogie"" not.

I found ""dhole"" — D H O L E? Position 4 is L? D(1),H(2),O(3),L(4),E(5). Not position 4 as E.

Not.

""drole"" not a word.

Perhaps ""duple"" not.

Let's choose ""drape"" even though it has A.

No, A is excluded.

Final attempt: ""druse"". We already said it doesn't work.

Maybe ""dreks"" not.

Perhaps I have to accept a word like ""breed"" but it has E at position 3 and B at 1, and we can guess that to confirm, but B is not excluded.

Of the excluded letters, B is not excluded.

So let's use ""breed"": B R E E D.

But B at position 1.

And E at position 3 and 4.

But we know from guess3 that E is not at position 3? The feedback E(-) at position 3 in "" greed"" for a different guess ""greed"" suggests that E is not at position 3. So guessing ""breed"" would have E at position 3 again, which should show as 'x' or '-'? It might be consistent.

But to avoid redundancy, perhaps use ""bread"" but A excluded.

Not.

"" blood"" not.

The word ""freed"" is already suspected.

Another word: ""deers"" but D E E R S not R at 2.

I think the best is to use ""pried"" for if D at position 5, but D not at 5.

Still not.

Let's think of ""dryer"" D R Y E R? D(1),R(2),Y(3),E(4),R(5). Yes! Position 4 is E.
- Pattern: D R Y E R
- 5 letters: ""dryer""
- Letters: D, R, Y, E, R (R repeating)
- Avoids excluded letters: C,A,N,T,I,G
- Includes D at position 1 (testing if D is at position 1)
- Introduces Y at position 3 and R at position 5 (but R at position 5 is a repeat)

This is a valid word.

Guess: ""dryer""

Feedback would show:
- Position 1: D (we want to see if D is correct here)
- Position 2: R (correct)
- Position 3: Y
- Position 4: E (correct)
- Position 5: R (repeat R)

If the secret word has only one R, then the R at position 5 might be marked as not in the word or misplaced? But we already have R at position 2.

Secret word has R at position 2, so position 5 R is additional.

But it's worth a try.

Another word: ""diker"" but I excluded.

Not.

""daker"" rare.

So I choose ""dryer"".

  - **""dryer""** fits the pattern (`D R Y E R`):
    - Position 1: D (test if D is correct here).
    - Position 2: R (✓ confirmed).
    - Position 3: Y (test new letter).
    - Position 4: E (✓ confirmed).
    - Position 5: R (test if R repeats, providing info on R frequency).
  - This tests D at position 1, uses Y (common consonanty), and adheres to known constraints.

- **Expected Outcomes**:
  - Feedback will clarify:
    - If D is at position 1 (✓ or x).
    - If Y is in the word and its position.
    - If R appears twice (via position 5 feedback).",Guess 4: dryer -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) R(✓) Y(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
