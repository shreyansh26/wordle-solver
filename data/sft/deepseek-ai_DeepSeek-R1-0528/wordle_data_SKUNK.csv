We are starting the game. Since we have no prior knowledge of the secret word, we need to make a guess that maximizes the information we can get for the next guess.
 A common strategy is to use a word that includes common letters and distinct letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.

 Let's consider the following: English letters that are frequent include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, N, L).
 We want to get feedback on as many common letters as possible.

 One of the popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T). Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also a good one.

 However, note that we have 6 tries. Let me choose a word that includes a variety of letters.

 I choose: ""CRANE""

 Why?
 - It has two vowels: A, E
 - Three consonants: C, R, N (which are fairly common)
 - All distinct letters: so we can get clear feedback on each.

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".
</think>
<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain. I should pick a word with common letters to cover frequent vowels and consonants. An optimal first guess often includes vowels and common consonants to test multiple possibilities at once.

After considering words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It contains two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N) 
- All letters are distinct, avoiding redundant feedback  
- C, R, A, N, E appear frequently in English words  
- This combination provides broad coverage for positional feedback  

""Crane"" lets me test:
- Vowels: A in position 3, E in position 5  
- Consonants: C (start), R (mid), N (end)  

The feedback will clarify:  
- Which consonants exist in the secret word  
- Vowel presence/position  
- Several positional relationships  

This sets up an efficient second guess regardless of the outcome.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
This means:
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since N is the 4th letter in CRANE: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5).
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the letter N in the fourth position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.

Since the word must be 5 letters and English, we can deduce:
- The fourth letter is N.
- The word does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, E.

We are making the second guess.

Strategy:
- We know the fourth letter is N, so we can fix that position to N in our next guess? But note: we are not forced to put N in the fourth position because we are trying to get more information? Actually, we can choose to fix it to confirm or to test other positions.

However, note the feedback: N is in the correct position. So in the secret word, position 4 is N. Therefore, for our next guess, if we put N in the fourth position, we can get feedback on the other letters. If we don't, then we might get a '-' for N elsewhere, but that would be confusing because we know that N is already in position 4 and might not be duplicated? Let me check: the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say that the word has unique letters. So it's possible to have duplicate letters.

But note the feedback: for the first guess, we had one N in the fourth position and it was marked as ✓. And the other letters were absent. So it is possible that the secret word has another N? But the feedback doesn't show multiple marks for duplicates? Let me clarify the rules.

The example: Secret Word: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word but wrong position? Wait, in the example: S is the first letter? Actually, in STORM: S, T, O, R, M. Feedback: S(-) meaning present but wrong position? But in BRISK, there is an S at position 4? So S in STORM is at position 1, but in BRISK it's at position 4, so S gets '-'.

But what if there are duplicates? For example, if the secret word is APPLE and we guess PAPER: then the first P would be '-' (present but wrong position) because there is a P in secret at position 2? Actually, for APPLE: letters are A, P, P, L, E. Guess PAPER: P in position 1, A in position 2, P in position 3, E in position 4, R in position 5.

Feedback:
- The secret has P at positions 2 and 3? So for the guess:
  - Position 1: P -> present? but wrong position? Because secret has P at 2 and 3? Since secret has two P's, if guess has a P and it's not in the first position, but secret has P elsewhere? Actually, the rule: it marks for each occurrence. Typically, Wordle uses a rule that only marks a letter once if it appears once? Actually no, Wordle handles duplicates: if there is a duplicate in the secret, then both must be accounted for. 

But I don't want to complicate. Since we have feedback that N is at position 4 and the others are absent, and no indication of duplicates, we can assume that there might be no other N? But we don't know. However, to be safe, let's avoid using N in other positions for now? Or we can try to test whether there is another N? But we have limited guesses. Probably not necessary at this point.

Given that we know:
- Position 4 is N.
- The word does not contain C, R, A, E.

So we need to choose a word that:
- Has N in the fourth position? Actually, we don't have to, but it might be efficient because if we put N in fourth again and it shows ✓ again, we confirm. But we already know position 4 is N. So putting N in fourth will give us ✓ for that, and we can focus on testing other letters.

So I recommend a guess that has N in the fourth position, and uses other letters that are common and not in the set {C,R,A,E}. This way we get information about other positions.

What letters are available? We have eliminated C,R,A,E. So we can use: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters to test: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

We also know that vowels are important: the word must have vowels since it's English. The vowels excluding A and E: we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So we should include at least one vowel? But note: the secret word might have no A,E, but must have one of I,O,U,Y or else it wouldn't be a word.

So let's pick a word that:
- Has N in the fourth position.
- Uses other letters from the available set.
- Includes at least one vowel (I,O,U, or Y).

Popular words: but avoid letters we've already eliminated.

Example: TUNIC? TUNIC: T,U,N,I,C? But C is eliminated? We know C is absent, so TUNIC has C which is wasted? We shouldn't use C again because we know it's not in the word.

Better: words without C, R, A, E.

Idea: words ending with N? So fourth position, then fifth letter. The word is ? ? ? N ? 

Possible words: 
- _ _ _ N S? But the fifth letter must be a letter we haven't tried? We know E is out? So let's avoid S at fifth? Actually, we can use S.

For the fourth position to be N, and we can try to get the fifth letter.

Examples of words: 
- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> but T is an option? Also, it has I which is a vowel.
- JOINT: J,O,I,N,T -> similar.
- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> uses O and U? 
- DONUT: D,O,N,U,T -> wait, DONUT has N at position 3? No: D-O-N-U-T -> position: D(1),O(2),N(3),U(4),T(5) -> but we want N at position 4? So that doesn't fix.

We need a word where N is at position 4: so letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

Examples:
- SPOON? S,P,O,O,N -> but N is at position 5? Not 4.
- PLAN? PLAN is 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words with N at position 4? So pattern: ...N.

For example:
- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> N is the fourth letter? Positions: P1, O2, I3, N4, T5 -> yes.
- JOINT: same
- MOINT? Not a word? But JOINT is valid.
- FAINT: F,A,I,N,T -> but A is eliminated? We cannot use A because we know A is not in the word? So avoid A.
- Similarly, PRINT: P,R,I,N,T -> R is eliminated? So no R.
- So we need a word without C,R,A,E and with N in the fourth position.

Possible words:
- POINT: letters P,O,I,N,T -> available? P, O, I, T are all new? O and I are vowels? Also T is common.
- JOINT: J is less common? Probably not as good? But both are valid.

Other words: 
- COUNT: C,O,U,N,T -> C is eliminated? We can't use C.
- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> M is okay? M, O, U, T? O and U are vowels -> valid word.
- MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> but N? We need N at position 4. MOIST has no N? Wrong.

So for ...N., examples: 
- POINT: uses P,O,I,T? But O and I are vowels? And P, T consonants? Yes.
- Also, STINK: S,T,I,N,K -> N is fourth? Positions: S(1),T(2),I(3),N(4),K(5). But I is vowel? And S,T,K are consonants-> valid but has I? 
But note: we haven't tested I, O, U, etc.

We could use POINT? But let me check: is there a better word?

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't necessarily fix the N? But if we don't fix the fourth position, then we can test other positions? But since we know the fourth letter is N, and we test N elsewhere? But we might get feedback that N is present elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to put N at the fourth? However, putting N at fourth will confirm and we can focus on other letters.

In fact, given that we have fixed one position, it is efficient to build on that.

So I suggest POINT: uses new letters: P, O, I, T? And N at position 4.

But POINT has two vowels? O and I? That might be good for information.

Another option: JOINT? J is less common? So POINT is better? Or MOUNT? MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> vowels O and U? Also good? Both are valid.

Let's choose MOUNT? Why? Because it uses U which is another vowel? Not tested yet? Whereas POINT uses O and I? We are testing more vowels? Actually, we have to cover vowels: we know A and E are absent, so the vowels must be among I, O, U? By testing MOUNT, we cover O and U? And in POINT we cover O and I? So both are good? MOUNT also tests M and T? Same as POINT? Except POINT tests I and P, and MOUNT tests U and M.

Since M and P are both common? It's a toss-up. I'll go with POINT because ""point"" is a very common word? But MOUNT is also common? Actually, both are fine.

Another idea: SINEW? S,I,N,E,W -> but E is eliminated? We cannot use E? So not.

Avoid using eliminated letters.

So POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> avoids C,R,A,E? And has O and I? And N fixed at fourth.

But wait: in POINT, the N is at position four? Yes.

Alternatively, we could try to get the fifth letter? For example, words ending in ...NS? But we don't know if there is an S? We haven't tested S? Also, fifth letter could be anything? So testing the fifth letter is important.

With POINT, we test:
- Position1: P
- Position2: O
- Position3: I
- Position4: N (which we know, so we expect ✓ for N at 4? But it will be marked accordingly? Actually, if we put N at position 4 and it is indeed N, we get ✓. We can make that guess? It doesn't waste because we get information about positions 1,2,3,5.

Same with MOUNT.

Let me pick POINT? Or another word that avoids duplicate letters? POINT has distinct letters? Yes, all distinct? That is good for maximum information.

But note: MOUNT has distinct too: M,O,U,N,T? Also distinct? Both are distinct.

I think POINT is slightly better because 'I' is a very common vowel? And MOUNT has U which is less common? But that might be okay.

But let's see: POINT: P(common), O(common vowel), I(common vowel), N(fixed), T(common)? Also, the fifth letter T? It might be present.

But alternatively: STINT: S,T,I,N,T -> duplicate T? So not distinct? Avoid.

We want distinct letters to maximize information? Yes.

But POINT? Distinct: P,O,I,N,T -> yes.

Another candidate: JOINS? J,O,I,N,S -> not? JOINS: N is fourth? J(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),S(5)? Then we test J? J is low frequency? So POINT is better? P is better than J? Yes.

So we'll go with POINT.

But note: the secret word might not contain O or I? We don't know? So POINT might reveal.

Let me write: guess POINT.

But let me confirm: 
- We know the fourth letter is N? So POINT has N at position 4? Yes.
- We are testing P at position1, O at position2, I at position3, T at position5? Perfect.

So after guessing, we will get feedback: which of these are ✓, -, or x.

That will help narrow down.

Therefore, my second guess: POINT.

But wait: are we allowed to use POINT? It is a valid English word? Yes.

So <guess>POINT</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word.  
- N is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4).  

For the next guess, the strategy is to:  
- Fix N in position 4 to confirm its location and gather information on other positions.  
- Use letters not previously tested (avoid C, R, A, E) and prioritize common consonants and vowels (e.g., I, O, U).  
- Select a word with all distinct letters to maximize new information gain.  

The word ""POINT"" fits well because:  
- It places N in position 4, ensuring it will get a ✓ if correct.  
- It tests new letters: P (position 1), O (vowel at position 2), I (vowel at position 3), and T (position 5).  
- No duplicated letters mean feedback will be clearer for each position.  
- ""POINT"" uses common letters, increasing the chance of hits and narrowing possibilities.  

This guess will help identify whether P, O, I, or T are in the word and their potential positions.

<guess>POINT</guess>",POINT,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
This means:
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since N is the 4th letter in CRANE: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5).
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the letter N in the fourth position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.

Since the word must be 5 letters and English, we can deduce:
- The fourth letter is N.
- The word does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, E.

The example: Secret Word: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word but wrong position? Wait, in the example: S is the first letter? Actually, in STORM: S, T, O, R, M. Feedback: S(-) meaning present but wrong position? But in BRISK, there is an S at position 4? So S in STORM is at position 1, but in BRISK it's at position 4, so S gets '-'.

But what if there are duplicates? For example, if the secret word is APPLE and we guess PAPER: then the first P would be '-' (present but wrong position) because there is a P in secret at position 2? Actually, for APPLE: letters are A, P, P, L, E. Guess PAPER: P in position 1, A in position 2, P in position 3, E in position 4, R in position 5.

Feedback:
- The secret has P at positions 2 and 3? So for the guess:
  - Position 1: P -> present? but wrong position? Because secret has P at 2 and 3? Since secret has two P's, if guess has a P and it's not in the first position, but secret has P elsewhere? Actually, the rule: it marks for each occurrence. Typically, Wordle uses a rule that only marks a letter once if it appears once? Actually no, Wordle handles duplicates: if there is a duplicate in the secret, then both must be accounted for. 

But I don't want to complicate. Since we have feedback that N is at position 4 and the others are absent, and no indication of duplicates, we can assume that there might be no other N?

So I recommend a guess that has N in the fourth position, and uses other letters that are common and not in the set {C,R,A,E}. This way we get information about other positions.

What letters are available? We have eliminated C,R,A,E. So we can use: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters to test: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

We also know that vowels are important: the word must have vowels since it's English. The vowels excluding A and E: we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So we should include at least one vowel? But note: the secret word might have no A,E, but must have one of I,O,U,Y or else it wouldn't be a word.

So let's pick a word that:
- Has N in the fourth position.
- Uses other letters from the available set.
- Includes at least one vowel (I,O,U, or Y).

Popular words: but avoid letters we've already eliminated.

Example: TUNIC? TUNIC: T,U,N,I,C? But C is eliminated? We know C is absent, so TUNIC has C which is wasted? We shouldn't use C again because we know it's not in the word.

Better: words without C, R, A, E.

Idea: words ending with N? So fourth position, then fifth letter. The word is ? ? ? N ? 

Possible words: 
- _ _ _ N S? But the fifth letter must be a letter we haven't tried? We know E is out? So let's avoid S at fifth? Actually, we can use S.

For the fourth position to be N, and we can try to get the fifth letter.

Examples of words: 
- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> but T is an option? Also, it has I which is a vowel.
- JOINT: J,O,I,N,T -> similar.
- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> uses O and U? 
- DONUT: D,O,N,U,T -> wait, DONUT has N at position 3? No: D-O-N-U-T -> position: D(1),O(2),N(3),U(4),T(5) -> but we want N at position 4? So that doesn't fix.

We need a word where N is at position 4: so letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

Examples:
- SPOON? S,P,O,O,N -> but N is at position 5? Not 4.
- PLAN? PLAN is 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words with N at position 4? So pattern: ...N.

For example:
- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> N is the fourth letter? Positions: P1, O2, I3, N4, T5 -> yes.
- JOINT: same
- MOINT? Not a word? But JOINT is valid.
- FAINT: F,A,I,N,T -> but A is eliminated? We cannot use A because we know A is not in the word? So avoid A.
- Similarly, PRINT: P,R,I,N,T -> R is eliminated? So no R.
- So we need a word without C,R,A,E and with N in the fourth position.

Possible words:
- POINT: letters P,O,I,N,T -> available? P, O, I, T are all new? O and I are vowels? Also T is common.
- JOINT: J is less common? Probably not as good? But both are valid.

Other words: 
- COUNT: C,O,U,N,T -> C is eliminated? We can't use C.
- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> M is okay? M, O, U, T? O and U are vowels -> valid word.
- MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> but N? We need N at position 4. MOIST has no N? Wrong.

So for ...N., examples: 
- POINT: uses P,O,I,T? But O and I are vowels? And P, T consonants? Yes.
- Also, STINK: S,T,I,N,K -> N is fourth? Positions: S(1),T(2),I(3),N(4),K(5). But I is vowel? And S,T,K are consonants-> valid but has I? 
But note: we haven't tested I, O, U, etc.

We could use POINT? But let me check: is there a better word?

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't necessarily fix the N? But if we don't fix the fourth position, then we can test other positions? But since we know the fourth letter is N, and we test N elsewhere? But we might get feedback that N is present elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to put N at the fourth? However, putting N at fourth will confirm and we can focus on other letters.

In fact, given that we have fixed one position, it is efficient to build on that.

So I suggest POINT: uses new letters: P, O, I, T? And N at position 4.

But POINT has two vowels? O and I? That might be good for information.

Another option: JOINT? J is less common? So POINT is better? Or MOUNT? MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> vowels O and U? Also good? Both are valid.

Let's choose MOUNT? Why? Because it uses U which is another vowel? Not tested yet? Whereas POINT uses O and I? We are testing more vowels? Actually, we have to cover vowels: we know A and E are absent, so the vowels must be among I, O, U? By testing MOUNT, we cover O and U? And in POINT we cover O and I? So both are good? MOUNT also tests M and T? Same as POINT? Except POINT tests I and P, and MOUNT tests U and M.

Since M and P are both common? It's a toss-up. I'll go with POINT because ""point"" is a very common word? But MOUNT is also common? Actually, both are fine.

Another idea: SINEW? S,I,N,E,W -> but E is eliminated? We cannot use E? So not.

Avoid using eliminated letters.

So POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> avoids C,R,A,E? And has O and I? And N fixed at fourth.

But wait: in POINT, the N is at position four? Yes.

Alternatively, we could try to get the fifth letter? For example, words ending in ...NS? But we don't know if there is an S? We haven't tested S? Also, fifth letter could be anything? So testing the fifth letter is important.

With POINT, we test:
- Position1: P
- Position2: O
- Position3: I
- Position4: N (which we know, so we expect ✓ for N at 4? But it will be marked accordingly? Actually, if we put N at position 4 and it is indeed N, we get ✓. We can make that guess? It doesn't waste because we get information about positions 1,2,3,5.

Same with MOUNT.

Let me pick POINT? Or another word that avoids duplicate letters? POINT has distinct letters? Yes, all distinct? That is good for maximum information.

But note: MOUNT has distinct too: M,O,U,N,T? Also distinct? Both are distinct.

I think POINT is slightly better because 'I' is a very common vowel? And MOUNT has U which is less common? But that might be okay.

But let's see: POINT: P(common), O(common vowel), I(common vowel), N(fixed), T(common)? Also, the fifth letter T? It might be present.

But alternatively: STINT: S,T,I,N,T -> duplicate T? So not distinct? Avoid.

We want distinct letters to maximize information? Yes.

But POINT? Distinct: P,O,I,N,T -> yes.

Another candidate: JOINS? J,O,I,N,S -> not? JOINS: N is fourth? J(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),S(5)? Then we test J? J is low frequency? So POINT is better? P is better than J? Yes.

So we'll go with POINT.

But note: the secret word might not contain O or I? We don't know? So POINT might reveal.

Let me write: guess POINT.

But let me confirm: 
- We know the fourth letter is N? So POINT has N at position 4? Yes.
- We are testing P at position1, O at position2, I at position3, T at position5? Perfect.

So after guessing, we will get feedback: which of these are ✓, -, or x.

That will help narrow down.

Therefore, my second guess: POINT.

But wait: are we allowed to use POINT? It is a valid English word? Yes.

So <guess>POINT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word.  
- N is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4).  

For the next guess, the strategy is to:  
- Fix N in position 4 to confirm its location and gather information on other positions.  
- Use letters not previously tested (avoid C, R, A, E) and prioritize common consonants and vowels (e.g., I, O, U).  
- Select a word with all distinct letters to maximize new information gain.  

The word ""POINT"" fits well because:  
- It places N in position 4, ensuring it will get a ✓ if correct.  
- It tests new letters: P (position 1), O (vowel at position 2), I (vowel at position 3), and T (position 5).  
- No duplicated letters mean feedback will be clearer for each position.  
- ""POINT"" uses common letters, increasing the chance of hits and narrowing possibilities.  

This guess will help identify whether P, O, I, or T are in the word and their potential positions.",Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since we have no prior knowledge of the secret word, we need to make a guess that maximizes the information we can get for the next guess.
 A common strategy is to use a word that includes common letters and distinct letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.

 Let's consider the following: English letters that are frequent include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, N, L).
 We want to get feedback on as many common letters as possible.

 One of the popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T). Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also a good one.

 However, note that we have 6 tries. Let me choose a word that includes a variety of letters.

 I choose: ""CRANE""

 Why?
 - It has two vowels: A, E
 - Three consonants: C, R, N (which are fairly common)
 - All distinct letters: so we can get clear feedback on each.

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain. I should pick a word with common letters to cover frequent vowels and consonants. An optimal first guess often includes vowels and common consonants to test multiple possibilities at once.

After considering words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It contains two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N) 
- All letters are distinct, avoiding redundant feedback  
- C, R, A, N, E appear frequently in English words  
- This combination provides broad coverage for positional feedback  

""Crane"" lets me test:
- Vowels: A in position 3, E in position 5  
- Consonants: C (start), R (mid), N (end)  

The feedback will clarify:  
- Which consonants exist in the secret word  
- Vowel presence/position  
- Several positional relationships  

This sets up an efficient second guess regardless of the outcome.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
This means:
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since N is the 4th letter in CRANE: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5).
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the letter N in the fourth position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.

Since the word must be 5 letters and English, we can deduce:
- The fourth letter is N.
- The word does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, E.

We are making the second guess.

Strategy:
- We know the fourth letter is N, so we can fix that position to N in our next guess? But note: we are not forced to put N in the fourth position because we are trying to get more information? Actually, we can choose to fix it to confirm or to test other positions.

However, note the feedback: N is in the correct position. So in the secret word, position 4 is N. Therefore, for our next guess, if we put N in the fourth position, we can get feedback on the other letters. If we don't, then we might get a '-' for N elsewhere, but that would be confusing because we know that N is already in position 4 and might not be duplicated? Let me check: the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say that the word has unique letters. So it's possible to have duplicate letters.

But note the feedback: for the first guess, we had one N in the fourth position and it was marked as ✓. And the other letters were absent. So it is possible that the secret word has another N? But the feedback doesn't show multiple marks for duplicates? Let me clarify the rules.

The example: Secret Word: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word but wrong position? Wait, in the example: S is the first letter? Actually, in STORM: S, T, O, R, M. Feedback: S(-) meaning present but wrong position? But in BRISK, there is an S at position 4? So S in STORM is at position 1, but in BRISK it's at position 4, so S gets '-'.

But what if there are duplicates? For example, if the secret word is APPLE and we guess PAPER: then the first P would be '-' (present but wrong position) because there is a P in secret at position 2? Actually, for APPLE: letters are A, P, P, L, E. Guess PAPER: P in position 1, A in position 2, P in position 3, E in position 4, R in position 5.

Feedback:
- The secret has P at positions 2 and 3? So for the guess:
  - Position 1: P -> present? but wrong position? Because secret has P at 2 and 3? Since secret has two P's, if guess has a P and it's not in the first position, but secret has P elsewhere? Actually, the rule: it marks for each occurrence. Typically, Wordle uses a rule that only marks a letter once if it appears once? Actually no, Wordle handles duplicates: if there is a duplicate in the secret, then both must be accounted for. 

But I don't want to complicate. Since we have feedback that N is at position 4 and the others are absent, and no indication of duplicates, we can assume that there might be no other N? But we don't know. However, to be safe, let's avoid using N in other positions for now? Or we can try to test whether there is another N? But we have limited guesses. Probably not necessary at this point.

Given that we know:
- Position 4 is N.
- The word does not contain C, R, A, E.

So we need to choose a word that:
- Has N in the fourth position? Actually, we don't have to, but it might be efficient because if we put N in fourth again and it shows ✓ again, we confirm. But we already know position 4 is N. So putting N in fourth will give us ✓ for that, and we can focus on testing other letters.

So I recommend a guess that has N in the fourth position, and uses other letters that are common and not in the set {C,R,A,E}. This way we get information about other positions.

What letters are available? We have eliminated C,R,A,E. So we can use: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters to test: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

We also know that vowels are important: the word must have vowels since it's English. The vowels excluding A and E: we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So we should include at least one vowel? But note: the secret word might have no A,E, but must have one of I,O,U,Y or else it wouldn't be a word.

So let's pick a word that:
- Has N in the fourth position.
- Uses other letters from the available set.
- Includes at least one vowel (I,O,U, or Y).

Popular words: but avoid letters we've already eliminated.

Example: TUNIC? TUNIC: T,U,N,I,C? But C is eliminated? We know C is absent, so TUNIC has C which is wasted? We shouldn't use C again because we know it's not in the word.

Better: words without C, R, A, E.

Idea: words ending with N? So fourth position, then fifth letter. The word is ? ? ? N ? 

Possible words: 
- _ _ _ N S? But the fifth letter must be a letter we haven't tried? We know E is out? So let's avoid S at fifth? Actually, we can use S.

For the fourth position to be N, and we can try to get the fifth letter.

Examples of words: 
- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> but T is an option? Also, it has I which is a vowel.
- JOINT: J,O,I,N,T -> similar.
- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> uses O and U? 
- DONUT: D,O,N,U,T -> wait, DONUT has N at position 3? No: D-O-N-U-T -> position: D(1),O(2),N(3),U(4),T(5) -> but we want N at position 4? So that doesn't fix.

We need a word where N is at position 4: so letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

Examples:
- SPOON? S,P,O,O,N -> but N is at position 5? Not 4.
- PLAN? PLAN is 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words with N at position 4? So pattern: ...N.

For example:
- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> N is the fourth letter? Positions: P1, O2, I3, N4, T5 -> yes.
- JOINT: same
- MOINT? Not a word? But JOINT is valid.
- FAINT: F,A,I,N,T -> but A is eliminated? We cannot use A because we know A is not in the word? So avoid A.
- Similarly, PRINT: P,R,I,N,T -> R is eliminated? So no R.

- MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> but N? We need N at position 4. MOIST has no N? Wrong.

So for ...N., examples: 
- POINT: uses P,O,I,T? But O and I are vowels? And P, T consonants? Yes.
- Also, STINK: S,T,I,N,K -> N is fourth? Positions: S(1),T(2),I(3),N(4),K(5). But I is vowel? And S,T,K are consonants-> valid but has I?

An optimal first guess often includes vowels and common consonants to test multiple possibilities at once.\n\nAfter considering words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"" is a strong candidate because:\n- It contains two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N) \n- All letters are distinct, avoiding redundant feedback  \n- C, R, A, N, E appear frequently in English words  \n- This combination provides broad coverage for positional feedback  \n\n""Crane"" lets me test:\n- Vowels: A in position 3, E in position 5  \n- Consonants: C (start), R (mid), N (end)  \n\nThe feedback will clarify:  \n- Which consonants exist in the secret word  \n- Vowel presence/position  \n- Several positional relationships  \n\nThis sets up an efficient second guess regardless of the outcome.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nThis means:\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since N is the 4th letter in CRANE: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5).\n- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.\n\nSo the secret word has the letter N in the fourth position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nSince the word must be 5 letters and English, we can deduce:\n- The fourth letter is N.\n- The word does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, E.\n\nWe are making the second guess.\n\nStrategy:\n- We know the fourth letter is N, so we can fix that position to N in our next guess? But note: we are not forced to put N in the fourth position because we are trying to get more information? Actually, we can choose to fix it to confirm or to test other positions.\n\nHowever, note the feedback: N is in the correct position. So in the secret word, position 4 is N. Therefore, for our next guess, if we put N in the fourth position, we can get feedback on the other letters. If we don\'t, then we might get a \'-\' for N elsewhere, but that would be confusing because we know that N is already in position 4 and might not be duplicated? Let me check: the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say that the word has unique letters. So it\'s possible to have duplicate letters.\n\nBut note the feedback: for the first guess, we had one N in the fourth position and it was marked as ✓. And the other letters were absent. So it is possible that the secret word has another N? But the feedback doesn\'t show multiple marks for duplicates? Let me clarify the rules.\n\nThe example: Secret Word: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word but wrong position? Wait, in the example: S is the first letter? Actually, in STORM: S, T, O, R, M. Feedback: S(-) meaning present but wrong position? But in BRISK, there is an S at position 4? So S in STORM is at position 1, but in BRISK it\'s at position 4, so S gets \'-\'.\n\nBut what if there are duplicates? For example, if the secret word is APPLE and we guess PAPER: then the first P would be \'-\' (present but wrong position) because there is a P in secret at position 2? Actually, for APPLE: letters are A, P, P, L, E. Guess PAPER: P in position 1, A in position 2, P in position 3, E in position 4, R in position 5.\n\nFeedback:\n- The secret has P at positions 2 and 3? So for the guess:\n  - Position 1: P -> present? but wrong position? Because secret has P at 2 and 3? Since secret has two P\'s, if guess has a P and it\'s not in the first position, but secret has P elsewhere? Actually, the rule: it marks for each occurrence. Typically, Wordle uses a rule that only marks a letter once if it appears once? Actually no, Wordle handles duplicates: if there is a duplicate in the secret, then both must be accounted for. \n\nBut I don\'t want to complicate. Since we have feedback that N is at position 4 and the others are absent, and no indication of duplicates, we can assume that there might be no other N? But we don\'t know. However, to be safe, let\'s avoid using N in other positions for now? Or we can try to test whether there is another N? But we have limited guesses. Probably not necessary at this point.\n\nGiven that we know:\n- Position 4 is N.\n- The word does not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nSo we need to choose a word that:\n- Has N in the fourth position? Actually, we don\'t have to, but it might be efficient because if we put N in fourth again and it shows ✓ again, we confirm. But we already know position 4 is N. So putting N in fourth will give us ✓ for that, and we can focus on testing other letters.\n\nSo I recommend a guess that has N in the fourth position, and uses other letters that are common and not in the set {C,R,A,E}. This way we get information about other positions.\n\nWhat letters are available? We have eliminated C,R,A,E. So we can use: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nCommon letters to test: S, T, L, O, P, etc.\n\nWe also know that vowels are important: the word must have vowels since it\'s English. The vowels excluding A and E: we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So we should include at least one vowel? But note: the secret word might have no A,E, but must have one of I,O,U,Y or else it wouldn\'t be a word.\n\nSo let\'s pick a word that:\n- Has N in the fourth position.\n- Uses other letters from the available set.\n- Includes at least one vowel (I,O,U, or Y).\n\nPopular words: but avoid letters we\'ve already eliminated.\n\nExample: TUNIC? TUNIC: T,U,N,I,C? But C is eliminated? We know C is absent, so TUNIC has C which is wasted? We shouldn\'t use C again because we know it\'s not in the word.\n\nBetter: words without C, R, A, E.\n\nIdea: words ending with N? So fourth position, then fifth letter. The word is ? ? ? N ? \n\nPossible words: \n- _ _ _ N S? But the fifth letter must be a letter we haven\'t tried? We know E is out? So let\'s avoid S at fifth? Actually, we can use S.\n\nFor the fourth position to be N, and we can try to get the fifth letter.\n\nExamples of words: \n- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> but T is an option? Also, it has I which is a vowel.\n- JOINT: J,O,I,N,T -> similar.\n- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> uses O and U? \n- DONUT: D,O,N,U,T -> wait, DONUT has N at position 3? No: D-O-N-U-T -> position: D(1),O(2),N(3),U(4),T(5) -> but we want N at position 4? So that doesn\'t fix.\n\nWe need a word where N is at position 4: so letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.\n\nExamples:\n- SPOON? S,P,O,O,N -> but N is at position 5? Not 4.\n- PLAN? PLAN is 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n5-letter words with N at position 4? So pattern: ...N.\n\nFor example:\n- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> N is the fourth letter? Positions: P1, O2, I3, N4, T5 -> yes.\n- JOINT: same\n- MOINT? Not a word? But JOINT is valid.\n- FAINT: F,A,I,N,T -> but A is eliminated? We cannot use A because we know A is not in the word? So avoid A.\n- Similarly, PRINT: P,R,I,N,T -> R is eliminated? So no R.\n- So we need a word without C,R,A,E and with N in the fourth position.\n\nPossible words:\n- POINT: letters P,O,I,N,T -> available? P, O, I, T are all new? O and I are vowels? Also T is common.\n- JOINT: J is less common? Probably not as good? But both are valid.\n\nOther words: \n- COUNT: C,O,U,N,T -> C is eliminated? We can\'t use C.\n- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> M is okay? M, O, U, T? O and U are vowels -> valid word.\n- MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> but N? We need N at position 4. MOIST has no N? Wrong.\n\nSo for ...N., examples: \n- POINT: uses P,O,I,T? But O and I are vowels? And P, T consonants? Yes.\n- Also, STINK: S,T,I,N,K -> N is fourth? Positions: S(1),T(2),I(3),N(4),K(5). But I is vowel? And S,T,K are consonants-> valid but has I? \nBut note: we haven\'t tested I, O, U, etc.\n\nWe could use POINT? But let me check: is there a better word?\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that doesn\'t necessarily fix the N? But if we don\'t fix the fourth position, then we can test other positions? But since we know the fourth letter is N, and we test N elsewhere? But we might get feedback that N is present elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to put N at the fourth? However, putting N at fourth will confirm and we can focus on other letters.\n\nIn fact, given that we have fixed one position, it is efficient to build on that.\n\nSo I suggest POINT: uses new letters: P, O, I, T? And N at position 4.\n\nBut POINT has two vowels? O and I? That might be good for information.\n\nAnother option: JOINT? J is less common? So POINT is better? Or MOUNT? MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> vowels O and U? Also good? Both are valid.\n\nLet\'s choose MOUNT? Why? Because it uses U which is another vowel? Not tested yet? Whereas POINT uses O and I? We are testing more vowels? Actually, we have to cover vowels: we know A and E are absent, so the vowels must be among I, O, U? By testing MOUNT, we cover O and U? And in POINT we cover O and I? So both are good? MOUNT also tests M and T? Same as POINT? Except POINT tests I and P, and MOUNT tests U and M.\n\nSince M and P are both common? It\'s a toss-up. I\'ll go with POINT because ""point"" is a very common word? But MOUNT is also common? Actually, both are fine.\n\nAnother idea: SINEW? S,I,N,E,W -> but E is eliminated? We cannot use E? So not.\n\nAvoid using eliminated letters.\n\nSo POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> avoids C,R,A,E? And has O and I? And N fixed at fourth.\n\nBut wait: in POINT, the N is at position four? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to get the fifth letter? For example, words ending in ...NS? But we don\'t know if there is an S? We haven\'t tested S? Also, fifth letter could be anything? So testing the fifth letter is important.\n\nWith POINT, we test:\n- Position1: P\n- Position2: O\n- Position3: I\n- Position4: N (which we know, so we expect ✓ for N at 4? But it will be marked accordingly? Actually, if we put N at position 4 and it is indeed N, we get ✓. We can make that guess? It doesn\'t waste because we get information about positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nSame with MOUNT.\n\nLet me pick POINT? Or another word that avoids duplicate letters? POINT has distinct letters? Yes, all distinct? That is good for maximum information.\n\nBut note: MOUNT has distinct too: M,O,U,N,T? Also distinct? Both are distinct.\n\nI think POINT is slightly better because \'I\' is a very common vowel? And MOUNT has U which is less common? But that might be okay.\n\nBut let\'s see: POINT: P(common), O(common vowel), I(common vowel), N(fixed), T(common)? Also, the fifth letter T? It might be present.\n\nBut alternatively: STINT: S,T,I,N,T -> duplicate T? So not distinct? Avoid.\n\nWe want distinct letters to maximize information? Yes.\n\nBut POINT? Distinct: P,O,I,N,T -> yes.\n\nAnother candidate: JOINS? J,O,I,N,S -> not? JOINS: N is fourth? J(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),S(5)? Then we test J? J is low frequency? So POINT is better? P is better than J? Yes.\n\nSo we\'ll go with POINT.\n\nBut note: the secret word might not contain O or I? We don\'t know? So POINT might reveal.\n\nLet me write: guess POINT.\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- We know the fourth letter is N? So POINT has N at position 4? Yes.\n- We are testing P at position1, O at position2, I at position3, T at position5? Perfect.\n\nSo after guessing, we will get feedback: which of these are ✓, -, or x.\n\nThat will help narrow down.\n\nTherefore, my second guess: POINT.\n\nBut wait: are we allowed to use POINT? It is a valid English word? Yes.\n\nSo <guess>POINT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  \n- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word.  \n- N is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4).  \n\nFor the next guess, the strategy is to:  \n- Fix N in position 4 to confirm its location and gather information on other positions.  \n- Use letters not previously tested (avoid C, R, A, E) and prioritize common consonants and vowels (e.g., I, O, U).  \n- Select a word with all distinct letters to maximize new information gain.  \n\nThe word ""POINT"" fits well because:  \n- It places N in position 4, ensuring it will get a ✓ if correct.  \n- It tests new letters: P (position 1), O (vowel at position 2), I (vowel at position 3), and T (position 5).  \n- No duplicated letters mean feedback will be clearer for each position.  \n- ""POINT"" uses common letters, increasing the chance of hits and narrowing possibilities.  \n\nThis guess will help identify whether P, O, I, or T are in the word and their potential positions.\n\n<guess>POINT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → This means:
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

2. POINT: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x) → This means:
   - N is again in the correct position (position 4) — which we already knew.
   - P, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

So, combining the feedback:
- The secret word has the letter N in the 4th position.
- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

We now know that the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

We need to make a third guess. The word must be 5 letters, with the 4th letter being N, and none of the above letters.

Available letters: We have to avoid C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T. So the available letters are:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also need to consider that the word must have vowels. The vowels we haven't tried are U and sometimes Y (and rarely others, but mainly U and Y). So the word must contain at least one vowel, which could be U or Y.

We know the 4th letter is N, so the word pattern is: _ _ _ N _

We need to choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Uses only the available letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Includes at least one vowel (U or Y) to be a valid English word.

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:
- Ending with ""N"" and having the 4th letter as N? Actually, the 4th letter is N, so the word is ...N. 

Examples:
- SUN: but that's 3 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words with N at position 4:

- BUNCH? But C is eliminated? C is not allowed.
- DUNCE? D,U,N,C,E → C and E are eliminated? Not allowed.
- FUNKY: F,U,N,K,Y → Let's check: F(1), U(2), N(3)? No, we need N at position 4. FUNKY: F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5) → N is at position 3, not 4.

We need the pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

So:
- Position 1: any available letter
- Position 2: any available letter
- Position 3: any available letter
- Position 4: N (fixed)
- Position 5: any available letter

Now, we need to form a valid English word.

Let me list some possibilities:

- Using U as a vowel: 
  - ? U ? N ? 
  - Examples: 
    - BUNCH → but C and H? B(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) → N is at 3, not 4. Wrong pattern.
    - We need the N at 4, so the vowel should be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But position 3 is before N? 

Actually, the vowel can be in any position. But we need the word to have the form ...N.

Let me think of words ending with ""UN"" or similar? But that would be position 4 and 5? Not necessarily.

Better to think of words with N as the fourth letter.

Examples:
- BLANK: B,L,A,N,K → but A is eliminated? A is not allowed.
- FLANK: F,L,A,N,K → A not allowed.
- PLANK: P,L,A,N,K → P and A not allowed.
- THANK: T,H,A,N,K → T and A not allowed.

We need to avoid A and T? So not.

- Using U:
  - DAUNT: D,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - FAULT: F,A,U,L,T → A and T not allowed.
  - GAUNT: G,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - HAUNT: H,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - JAUNT: J,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - VAUNT: V,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.

All these have A and T? T is eliminated? Yes, from POINT feedback.

What about words with U and without A or T?

- BUNGS? B,U,N,G,S → but N is at position 3? B(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),S(5) → not pattern.

We need N at 4? So position 3 must be a letter, then N at 4.

- How about: _ _ U N _ ? That is, U at position 3, then N at 4? So the word has U in the third position.

Examples:
- LUNGS: L,U,N,G,S → L(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),S(5) → N is at 3, not 4? Wrong.

Pattern: position 3 is U, position 4 is N? So the word is: letter1, letter2, U, N, letter5.

Examples:
- Not common? Let me think: 
  - BOUND: B,O,U,N,D → O is eliminated? O not allowed.
  - FOUND: F,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - HOUND: H,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - MOUND: M,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - POUND: P,O,U,N,D → P and O not allowed.
  - ROUND: R,O,U,N,D → R and O not allowed.
  - SOUND: S,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - WOUND: W,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.

All have O? Which is eliminated.

What about with Y? Y can be a vowel.

- Words with Y: 
  - LYNN? Not 5 letters.
  - SYNOD: S,Y,N,O,D → O not allowed? And N is at position 3? S(1),Y(2),N(3),O(4),D(5) → not pattern.

Pattern: ...N. with N at 4.

- STYNY? Not a word? 
- SHINY: S,H,I,N,Y → I is eliminated? I not allowed.

We need to use U or Y without the eliminated letters.

Another idea: the vowel might be in position 1 or 2 or 5.

For example, position 5 could be a vowel? Like U or Y.

Pattern: _ _ _ N U or _ _ _ N Y

Words ending with NU? Not common? Or NY?

- MANU? Not 5 letters.
- MENU: M,E,N,U → E not allowed and 4 letters.

5-letter words ending with NU? I can't think of any.

Ending with NY:
- FUNNY: F,U,N,N,Y → but N is at position 3 and 4? F(1),U(2),N(3),N(4),Y(5) → so position 4 is N? Yes! And it has two N's? But we know N is at position 4, and it might have another N? But we don't know? The feedback for CRANE only showed one N? But it could have more? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? Actually, in CRANE, we had N at position 4 and it was marked ✓, but if there was another N, we wouldn't know? Because we didn't test it? But in POINT, we had N at position 4 and it was ✓, and no other N? But we didn't have N elsewhere? So it's possible that there is another N? But we don't know.

So FUNNY: 
- F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5)
- We know position 4 is N? So the second N (at position 4) is correct? But what about the first N at position 3? If the secret word has only one N, then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two N's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position? Or if the secret has N at position 4, and we have N at position 3 and 4, then position 3 would be marked as '-' if there is another N? But we don't know.

But let's consider: we are allowed to use N again? But we know N is in the word? So we can use it? But in this case, for FUNNY, we are testing F, U, and Y? And also testing if there is another N? But we are not sure.

But we have to avoid eliminated letters? FUNNY: F, U, N, N, Y. U and Y are vowels? F and Y are new? But we have to check if U and Y are available? U is available? Y is available? And F is available? Yes.

But the problem: we are testing two N's? But we know one N is at position 4? So if we guess FUNNY, and the secret word has only one N (at position 4), then:
- Position 1: F → if not in word, x
- Position 2: U → if in word, might be marked
- Position 3: N → but since there is only one N and it's at position 4, this would be marked x? Because the N is already used at position 4? Or marked as absent? Yes, typically, if there is only one N, and we have two in the guess, the first one might be marked absent if not in the word? But position 3: N is not in the word? So x? And position 4: N is correct? ✓? And position 5: Y? 

But if the secret word has two N's, then position 3 N might be marked as '-' if there is an N elsewhere? But we don't know.

However, we are trying to get information? So it might be messy? But we have to guess a word? And FUNNY is a valid word? But let's see if there are better options.

Another word: BUNNY? B,U,N,N,Y → same issue? And B is available? But again, two N's.

We need a word with distinct letters? But it's hard? Because we have to use available letters and have N at position 4.

What about: SULUS? Not a word? 

Another idea: use Y as a vowel in position 5.

Pattern: _ _ _ N Y

Words:
- SUNNY: S,U,N,N,Y → two N's? S(1),U(2),N(3),N(4),Y(5) → position 4 is N? Yes? But again, two N's? And U is at position 2? But we can test U and Y? And S? 

But same duplicate issue? 

- GUNKY: G,U,N,K,Y → G(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → but N is at position 3? Not 4? We need N at position 4? So not.

- JUMBY? Not a word? 

- LUNGY: L,U,N,G,Y → L(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),Y(5) → N at 3? Not 4.

We need to have the third letter be something else, then N at 4.

How about: BUG? Not 5 letters.

Let's search for words with pattern: ??N? and N at position 4.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And must include a vowel: U or Y.

Possible words:
- DUNGY? Not a word? 
- FUNKY: F,U,N,K,Y → N at position 3? F(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → so position 4 is K? But we need position 4 to be N? So not.

I think I'm stuck with words that have N at position 4 and use U or Y.

Another word: MUMMY? M,U,M,M,Y → but N? No N? We need N at position 4? Not.

Perhaps: BUNCH? But N at 3? Not.

Let's think of: the word ""SWUNG"": S,W,U,N,G → S(1),W(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) → yes! N at position 4? And U at position 3? And S, W, G are available? And U is vowel? 

Is ""SWUNG"" a valid word? Yes, past participle of swing? Like ""the door was swung open"".

Letters: S, W, U, N, G? All distinct? S, W, U, N, G? Yes, all distinct? And we haven't tested S, W, U, G? U is new? And we need to test vowels? U is a vowel.

Also, no eliminated letters? S, W, U, G are not in the eliminated set? Eliminated: C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T? So S, W, U, G are all allowed.

Perfect! So we can guess ""SWUNG"".

Another option: ""FLUNG"": F,L,U,N,G → F(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) → also valid? But L is available? Yes? But we haven't tested L? So both are good? But SWUNG has S and W? Which are common? FLUNG has F and L? Also common? 

But we can choose one? Let's go with SWUNG? Or FLUNG? 

Another one: ""SLUNG"": S,L,U,N,G → similar? But L is available? 

But to maximize new letters? We have 6 guesses? So it's okay? 

I think SWUNG is fine? Or perhaps we can choose a word that tests more common letters? S is more common than F? But both are okay.

But let's see: we have to avoid many letters? So SWUNG: S, W, U, N, G.

We can also consider ""STUNG"": but T is eliminated? From POINT, T is absent? So not allowed? STUNG has T? S,T,U,N,G → T is not allowed? So we cannot use T.

Similarly, ""SKUNK"": S,K,U,N,K → duplicate K? And K at position 2 and 5? But we need to test? But duplicate? And not distinct? But it's a word? But we can use? But we want distinct for more information? But not necessary? 

But SKUNK: S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → position 4 is N? Yes? But K appears twice? If we guess, and the secret has K, it might be marked? But we don't know? 

But to keep it simple, let's go with SWUNG? It has distinct letters? And common? 

Another word: ""BULGY""? Not common? 

I think SWUNG is a good choice.

So third guess: SWUNG

But let's write it: S-W-U-N-G

Positions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G

We expect N at position 4 to be ✓? And we test S, W, U, G.

If any of them are in the word, we get feedback.

So <guess>SWUNG</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: POINT**  
  Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is confirmed again at position 4 (no new information here).  
  - P, O, I, T are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Insights
1. **Fixed Position**: The 4th letter is **N**.  
2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T (8 letters eliminated).  
3. **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Vowel Constraint**: Since A, E, I, O are eliminated, the secret word must contain **U** or **Y** (or both) as vowels.  
5. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ _ _ N _`.  

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Prioritize testing new vowels**: Focus on **U** and **Y** (since other vowels are eliminated).  
- **Maximize information**: Use a word with distinct, common letters from the available set to test multiple positions.  
- **Leverage the fixed position**: Keep **N** at position 4 to confirm its placement and focus on other positions.  
- **Avoid eliminated letters**: Ensure no letters from {C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T} are used.  

### Why ""SWUNG""?
- **Word**: SWUNG  
- **Breakdown**:  
  - S (position 1): Common consonant, not tested yet.  
  - W (position 2): Common consonant, not tested.  
  - U (position 3): Untested vowel (critical for validation).  
  - N (position 4): Fixed (expected ✓).  
  - G (position 5): Common consonant, not tested.  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Tests 4 new letters (S, W, U, G), all distinct.  
  - Includes **U** (vowel), addressing the vowel constraint.  
  - Valid English word (past participle of ""swing"").  
  - Efficiently probes positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 with high-frequency letters.  

This guess will clarify:  
- If **S, W, U, or G** are in the secret word.  
- Their positions (via feedback).  
- Whether **U** is the missing vowel.  

<guess>SWUNG</guess>",SWUNG,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → This means:
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

2. POINT: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x) → This means:
   - N is again in the correct position (position 4) — which we already knew.
   - P, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

So, combining the feedback:
- The secret word has the letter N in the 4th position.
- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

We now know that the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

We need to make a third guess. The word must be 5 letters, with the 4th letter being N, and none of the above letters.

Available letters: We have to avoid C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T. So the available letters are:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also need to consider that the word must have vowels. The vowels we haven't tried are U and sometimes Y (and rarely others, but mainly U and Y). So the word must contain at least one vowel, which could be U or Y.

We know the 4th letter is N, so the word pattern is: _ _ _ N _

We need to choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Uses only the available letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Includes at least one vowel (U or Y) to be a valid English word.

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:
- Ending with ""N"" and having the 4th letter as N? Actually, the 4th letter is N, so the word is ...N. 

Examples:
- SUN: but that's 3 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words with N at position 4:

- BUNCH? But C is eliminated? C is not allowed.
- DUNCE? D,U,N,C,E → C and E are eliminated? Not allowed.
- FUNKY: F,U,N,K,Y → Let's check: F(1), U(2), N(3)? No, we need N at position 4. FUNKY: F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5) → N is at position 3, not 4.

We need the pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

So:
- Position 1: any available letter
- Position 2: any available letter
- Position 3: any available letter
- Position 4: N (fixed)
- Position 5: any available letter

Now, we need to form a valid English word.

Let me list some possibilities:

- Using U as a vowel: 
  - ? U ? N ? 
  - Examples: 
    - BUNCH → but C and H? B(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) → N is at 3, not 4. Wrong pattern.
    - We need the N at 4, so the vowel should be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But position 3 is before N? 

Actually, the vowel can be in any position. But we need the word to have the form ...N.

Let me think of words ending with ""UN"" or similar? But that would be position 4 and 5? Not necessarily.

Better to think of words with N as the fourth letter.

Examples:
- BLANK: B,L,A,N,K → but A is eliminated? A is not allowed.
- FLANK: F,L,A,N,K → A not allowed.
- PLANK: P,L,A,N,K → P and A not allowed.
- THANK: T,H,A,N,K → T and A not allowed.

We need to avoid A and T? So not.

- Using U:
  - DAUNT: D,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - FAULT: F,A,U,L,T → A and T not allowed.
  - GAUNT: G,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - HAUNT: H,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - JAUNT: J,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - VAUNT: V,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.

All these have A and T? T is eliminated? Yes, from POINT feedback.

What about words with U and without A or T?

- BUNGS? B,U,N,G,S → but N is at position 3? B(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),S(5) → not pattern.

We need N at 4? So position 3 must be a letter, then N at 4.

- How about: _ _ U N _ ? That is, U at position 3, then N at 4? So the word has U in the third position.

Examples:
- LUNGS: L,U,N,G,S → L(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),S(5) → N is at 3, not 4? Wrong.

Pattern: position 3 is U, position 4 is N? So the word is: letter1, letter2, U, N, letter5.

Examples:
- Not common? Let me think: 
  - BOUND: B,O,U,N,D → O is eliminated? O not allowed.
  - FOUND: F,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - HOUND: H,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - MOUND: M,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - POUND: P,O,U,N,D → P and O not allowed.
  - ROUND: R,O,U,N,D → R and O not allowed.
  - SOUND: S,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - WOUND: W,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.

All have O? Which is eliminated.

What about with Y? Y can be a vowel.

- Words with Y: 
  - LYNN? Not 5 letters.
  - SYNOD: S,Y,N,O,D → O not allowed? And N is at position 3? S(1),Y(2),N(3),O(4),D(5) → not pattern.

Pattern: ...N. with N at 4.

- STYNY? Not a word? 
- SHINY: S,H,I,N,Y → I is eliminated? I not allowed.

We need to use U or Y without the eliminated letters.

Another idea: the vowel might be in position 1 or 2 or 5.

For example, position 5 could be a vowel? Like U or Y.

Pattern: _ _ _ N U or _ _ _ N Y

Words ending with NU? Not common? Or NY?

- MANU? Not 5 letters.
- MENU: M,E,N,U → E not allowed and 4 letters.

5-letter words ending with NU? I can't think of any.

Ending with NY:
- FUNNY: F,U,N,N,Y → but N is at position 3 and 4? F(1),U(2),N(3),N(4),Y(5) → so position 4 is N? Yes! And it has two N's? But we know N is at position 4, and it might have another N? But we don't know? The feedback for CRANE only showed one N? But it could have more? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? Actually, in CRANE, we had N at position 4 and it was marked ✓, but if there was another N, we wouldn't know? Because we didn't test it? But in POINT, we had N at position 4 and it was ✓, and no other N? But we didn't have N elsewhere? So it's possible that there is another N? But we don't know.

So FUNNY: 
- F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5)
- We know position 4 is N? So the second N (at position 4) is correct? But what about the first N at position 3? If the secret word has only one N, then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two N's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position? Or if the secret has N at position 4, and we have N at position 3 and 4, then position 3 would be marked as '-' if there is another N? But we don't know.

But let's consider: we are allowed to use N again? But we know N is in the word? So we can use it? But in this case, for FUNNY, we are testing F, U, and Y? And also testing if there is another N? But we are not sure.

But we have to avoid eliminated letters? FUNNY: F, U, N, N, Y. U and Y are vowels? F and Y are new? But we have to check if U and Y are available? U is available? Y is available? And F is available? Yes.

But the problem: we are testing two N's? But we know one N is at position 4? So if we guess FUNNY, and the secret word has only one N (at position 4), then:
- Position 1: F → if not in word, x
- Position 2: U → if in word, might be marked
- Position 3: N → but since there is only one N and it's at position 4, this would be marked x? Because the N is already used at position 4? Or marked as absent? Yes, typically, if there is only one N, and we have two in the guess, the first one might be marked absent if not in the word? But position 3: N is not in the word? So x? And position 4: N is correct? ✓? And position 5: Y? 

But if the secret word has two N's, then position 3 N might be marked as '-' if there is an N elsewhere? But we don't know.

However, we are trying to get information? So it might be messy? But we have to guess a word? And FUNNY is a valid word? But let's see if there are better options.

Another word: BUNNY? B,U,N,N,Y → same issue? And B is available? But again, two N's.

We need a word with distinct letters? But it's hard? Because we have to use available letters and have N at position 4.

What about: SULUS? Not a word? 

Another idea: use Y as a vowel in position 5.

Pattern: _ _ _ N Y

Words:
- SUNNY: S,U,N,N,Y → two N's? S(1),U(2),N(3),N(4),Y(5) → position 4 is N? Yes? But again, two N's? And U is at position 2? But we can test U and Y? And S? 

But same duplicate issue? 

- GUNKY: G,U,N,K,Y → G(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → but N is at position 3? Not 4? We need N at position 4? So not.

- JUMBY? Not a word? 

- LUNGY: L,U,N,G,Y → L(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),Y(5) → N at 3? Not 4.

We need to have the third letter be something else, then N at 4.

How about: BUG? Not 5 letters.

Let's search for words with pattern: ??N? and N at position 4.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And must include a vowel: U or Y.

Possible words:
- DUNGY? Not a word? 
- FUNKY: F,U,N,K,Y → N at position 3? F(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → so position 4 is K? But we need position 4 to be N? So not.

I think I'm stuck with words that have N at position 4 and use U or Y.

Another word: MUMMY? M,U,M,M,Y → but N? No N? We need N at position 4? Not.

Perhaps: BUNCH? But N at 3? Not.

Let's think of: the word ""SWUNG"": S,W,U,N,G → S(1),W(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) → yes! N at position 4? And U at position 3? And S, W, G are available? And U is vowel? 

Is ""SWUNG"" a valid word? Yes, past participle of swing? Like ""the door was swung open"".

Letters: S, W, U, N, G? All distinct? S, W, U, N, G? Yes, all distinct? And we haven't tested S, W, U, G? U is new? And we need to test vowels? U is a vowel.

Also, no eliminated letters? S, W, U, G are not in the eliminated set? Eliminated: C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T? So S, W, U, G are all allowed.

Perfect! So we can guess ""SWUNG"".

Another option: ""FLUNG"": F,L,U,N,G → F(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) → also valid? But L is available? Yes? But we haven't tested L? So both are good? But SWUNG has S and W? Which are common? FLUNG has F and L? Also common? 

But we can choose one? Let's go with SWUNG? Or FLUNG? 

Another one: ""SLUNG"": S,L,U,N,G → similar? But L is available? 

But to maximize new letters? We have 6 guesses? So it's okay? 

I think SWUNG is fine? Or perhaps we can choose a word that tests more common letters? S is more common than F? But both are okay.

But let's see: we have to avoid many letters? So SWUNG: S, W, U, N, G.

We can also consider ""STUNG"": but T is eliminated? From POINT, T is absent? So not allowed? STUNG has T? S,T,U,N,G → T is not allowed? So we cannot use T.

Similarly, ""SKUNK"": S,K,U,N,K → duplicate K? And K at position 2 and 5? But we need to test? But duplicate? And not distinct? But it's a word? But we can use? But we want distinct for more information? But not necessary? 

But SKUNK: S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → position 4 is N? Yes? But K appears twice? If we guess, and the secret has K, it might be marked? But we don't know? 

But to keep it simple, let's go with SWUNG? It has distinct letters? And common? 

Another word: ""BULGY""? Not common? 

I think SWUNG is a good choice.

So third guess: SWUNG

But let's write it: S-W-U-N-G

Positions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G

We expect N at position 4 to be ✓? And we test S, W, U, G.

If any of them are in the word, we get feedback.

So <guess>SWUNG</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: POINT**  
  Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is confirmed again at position 4 (no new information here).  
  - P, O, I, T are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Insights
1. **Fixed Position**: The 4th letter is **N**.  
2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T (8 letters eliminated).  
3. **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Vowel Constraint**: Since A, E, I, O are eliminated, the secret word must contain **U** or **Y** (or both) as vowels.  
5. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ _ _ N _`.  

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Prioritize testing new vowels**: Focus on **U** and **Y** (since other vowels are eliminated).  
- **Maximize information**: Use a word with distinct, common letters from the available set to test multiple positions.  
- **Leverage the fixed position**: Keep **N** at position 4 to confirm its placement and focus on other positions.  
- **Avoid eliminated letters**: Ensure no letters from {C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T} are used.  

### Why ""SWUNG""?
- **Word**: SWUNG  
- **Breakdown**:  
  - S (position 1): Common consonant, not tested yet.  
  - W (position 2): Common consonant, not tested.  
  - U (position 3): Untested vowel (critical for validation).  
  - N (position 4): Fixed (expected ✓).  
  - G (position 5): Common consonant, not tested.  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Tests 4 new letters (S, W, U, G), all distinct.  
  - Includes **U** (vowel), addressing the vowel constraint.  
  - Valid English word (past participle of ""swing"").  
  - Efficiently probes positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 with high-frequency letters.  

This guess will clarify:  
- If **S, W, U, or G** are in the secret word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since we have no prior knowledge of the secret word, we need to make a guess that maximizes the information we can get for the next guess.
 A common strategy is to use a word that includes common letters and distinct letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.

 Let's consider the following: English letters that are frequent include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, N, L).
 We want to get feedback on as many common letters as possible.

 One of the popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T). Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also a good one.

 However, note that we have 6 tries. Let me choose a word that includes a variety of letters.

 I choose: ""CRANE""

 Why?
 - It has two vowels: A, E
 - Three consonants: C, R, N (which are fairly common)
 - All distinct letters: so we can get clear feedback on each.

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain. I should pick a word with common letters to cover frequent vowels and consonants. An optimal first guess often includes vowels and common consonants to test multiple possibilities at once.

After considering words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It contains two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N) 
- All letters are distinct, avoiding redundant feedback  
- C, R, A, N, E appear frequently in English words  
- This combination provides broad coverage for positional feedback  

""Crane"" lets me test:
- Vowels: A in position 3, E in position 5  
- Consonants: C (start), R (mid), N (end)  

The feedback will clarify:  
- Which consonants exist in the secret word  
- Vowel presence/position  
- Several positional relationships  

This sets up an efficient second guess regardless of the outcome.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
This means:
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since N is the 4th letter in CRANE: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5).
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the letter N in the fourth position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.

Since the word must be 5 letters and English, we can deduce:
- The fourth letter is N.
- The word does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, E.

We are making the second guess.

Strategy:
- We know the fourth letter is N, so we can fix that position to N in our next guess? But note: we are not forced to put N in the fourth position because we are trying to get more information? Actually, we can choose to fix it to confirm or to test other positions.

However, note the feedback: N is in the correct position. So in the secret word, position 4 is N. Therefore, for our next guess, if we put N in the fourth position, we can get feedback on the other letters. If we don't, then we might get a '-' for N elsewhere, but that would be confusing because we know that N is already in position 4 and might not be duplicated? Let me check: the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say that the word has unique letters. So it's possible to have duplicate letters.

But note the feedback: for the first guess, we had one N in the fourth position and it was marked as ✓. And the other letters were absent. So it is possible that the secret word has another N? But the feedback doesn't show multiple marks for duplicates? Let me clarify the rules.

The example: Secret Word: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word but wrong position? Wait, in the example: S is the first letter? Actually, in STORM: S, T, O, R, M. Feedback: S(-) meaning present but wrong position? But in BRISK, there is an S at position 4? So S in STORM is at position 1, but in BRISK it's at position 4, so S gets '-'.

But what if there are duplicates? For example, if the secret word is APPLE and we guess PAPER: then the first P would be '-' (present but wrong position) because there is a P in secret at position 2? Actually, for APPLE: letters are A, P, P, L, E. Guess PAPER: P in position 1, A in position 2, P in position 3, E in position 4, R in position 5.

Feedback:
- The secret has P at positions 2 and 3? So for the guess:
  - Position 1: P -> present? but wrong position? Because secret has P at 2 and 3? Since secret has two P's, if guess has a P and it's not in the first position, but secret has P elsewhere? Actually, the rule: it marks for each occurrence. Typically, Wordle uses a rule that only marks a letter once if it appears once? Actually no, Wordle handles duplicates: if there is a duplicate in the secret, then both must be accounted for. 

But I don't want to complicate. Since we have feedback that N is at position 4 and the others are absent, and no indication of duplicates, we can assume that there might be no other N? But we don't know. However, to be safe, let's avoid using N in other positions for now? Or we can try to test whether there is another N? But we have limited guesses. Probably not necessary at this point.

Given that we know:
- Position 4 is N.
- The word does not contain C, R, A, E.

So we need to choose a word that:
- Has N in the fourth position? Actually, we don't have to, but it might be efficient because if we put N in fourth again and it shows ✓ again, we confirm. But we already know position 4 is N. So putting N in fourth will give us ✓ for that, and we can focus on testing other letters.

So I recommend a guess that has N in the fourth position, and uses other letters that are common and not in the set {C,R,A,E}. This way we get information about other positions.

What letters are available? We have eliminated C,R,A,E. So we can use: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters to test: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

We also know that vowels are important: the word must have vowels since it's English. The vowels excluding A and E: we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So we should include at least one vowel? But note: the secret word might have no A,E, but must have one of I,O,U,Y or else it wouldn't be a word.

So let's pick a word that:
- Has N in the fourth position.
- Uses other letters from the available set.
- Includes at least one vowel (I,O,U, or Y).

Popular words: but avoid letters we've already eliminated.

Example: TUNIC? TUNIC: T,U,N,I,C? But C is eliminated? We know C is absent, so TUNIC has C which is wasted? We shouldn't use C again because we know it's not in the word.

Better: words without C, R, A, E.

Idea: words ending with N? So fourth position, then fifth letter. The word is ? ? ? N ? 

Possible words: 
- _ _ _ N S? But the fifth letter must be a letter we haven't tried? We know E is out? So let's avoid S at fifth? Actually, we can use S.

For the fourth position to be N, and we can try to get the fifth letter.

Examples of words: 
- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> but T is an option? Also, it has I which is a vowel.
- JOINT: J,O,I,N,T -> similar.
- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> uses O and U? 
- DONUT: D,O,N,U,T -> wait, DONUT has N at position 3? No: D-O-N-U-T -> position: D(1),O(2),N(3),U(4),T(5) -> but we want N at position 4? So that doesn't fix.

We need a word where N is at position 4: so letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

Examples:
- SPOON? S,P,O,O,N -> but N is at position 5? Not 4.
- PLAN? PLAN is 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words with N at position 4? So pattern: ...N.

For example:
- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> N is the fourth letter? Positions: P1, O2, I3, N4, T5 -> yes.
- JOINT: same
- MOINT? Not a word? But JOINT is valid.
- FAINT: F,A,I,N,T -> but A is eliminated? We cannot use A because we know A is not in the word? So avoid A.
- Similarly, PRINT: P,R,I,N,T -> R is eliminated? So no R.
- So we need a word without C,R,A,E and with N in the fourth position.

Possible words:
- POINT: letters P,O,I,N,T -> available? P, O, I, T are all new? O and I are vowels? Also T is common.
- JOINT: J is less common? Probably not as good? But both are valid.

Other words: 
- COUNT: C,O,U,N,T -> C is eliminated? We can't use C.
- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> M is okay? M, O, U, T? O and U are vowels -> valid word.
- MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> but N? We need N at position 4. MOIST has no N? Wrong.

So for ...N., examples: 
- POINT: uses P,O,I,T? But O and I are vowels? And P, T consonants? Yes.
- Also, STINK: S,T,I,N,K -> N is fourth? Positions: S(1),T(2),I(3),N(4),K(5). But I is vowel? And S,T,K are consonants-> valid but has I? 
But note: we haven't tested I, O, U, etc.

We could use POINT? But let me check: is there a better word?

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't necessarily fix the N? But if we don't fix the fourth position, then we can test other positions? But since we know the fourth letter is N, and we test N elsewhere? But we might get feedback that N is present elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to put N at the fourth? However, putting N at fourth will confirm and we can focus on other letters.

In fact, given that we have fixed one position, it is efficient to build on that.

So I suggest POINT: uses new letters: P, O, I, T? And N at position 4.

But POINT has two vowels? O and I? That might be good for information.

Another option: JOINT? J is less common? So POINT is better? Or MOUNT? MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> vowels O and U? Also good? Both are valid.

Let's choose MOUNT? Why? Because it uses U which is another vowel? Not tested yet? Whereas POINT uses O and I? We are testing more vowels? Actually, we have to cover vowels: we know A and E are absent, so the vowels must be among I, O, U? By testing MOUNT, we cover O and U? And in POINT we cover O and I? So both are good? MOUNT also tests M and T? Same as POINT? Except POINT tests I and P, and MOUNT tests U and M.

Since M and P are both common? It's a toss-up. I'll go with POINT because ""point"" is a very common word? But MOUNT is also common? Actually, both are fine.

Another idea: SINEW? S,I,N,E,W -> but E is eliminated? We cannot use E? So not.

Avoid using eliminated letters.

So POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> avoids C,R,A,E? And has O and I? And N fixed at fourth.

But wait: in POINT, the N is at position four? Yes.

Alternatively, we could try to get the fifth letter? For example, words ending in ...NS? But we don't know if there is an S? We haven't tested S? Also, fifth letter could be anything? So testing the fifth letter is important.

With POINT, we test:
- Position1: P
- Position2: O
- Position3: I
- Position4: N (which we know, so we expect ✓ for N at 4? But it will be marked accordingly? Actually, if we put N at position 4 and it is indeed N, we get ✓. We can make that guess? It doesn't waste because we get information about positions 1,2,3,5.

Same with MOUNT.

Let me pick POINT? Or another word that avoids duplicate letters? POINT has distinct letters? Yes, all distinct? That is good for maximum information.

But note: MOUNT has distinct too: M,O,U,N,T? Also distinct? Both are distinct.

I think POINT is slightly better because 'I' is a very common vowel? And MOUNT has U which is less common? But that might be okay.

But let's see: POINT: P(common), O(common vowel), I(common vowel), N(fixed), T(common)? Also, the fifth letter T? It might be present.

But alternatively: STINT: S,T,I,N,T -> duplicate T? So not distinct? Avoid.

We want distinct letters to maximize information? Yes.

But POINT? Distinct: P,O,I,N,T -> yes.

Another candidate: JOINS? J,O,I,N,S -> not? JOINS: N is fourth? J(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),S(5)? Then we test J? J is low frequency? So POINT is better? P is better than J? Yes.

So we'll go with POINT.

But note: the secret word might not contain O or I? We don't know? So POINT might reveal.

Let me write: guess POINT.

But let me confirm: 
- We know the fourth letter is N? So POINT has N at position 4? Yes.
- We are testing P at position1, O at position2, I at position3, T at position5? Perfect.

So after guessing, we will get feedback: which of these are ✓, -, or x.

That will help narrow down.

Therefore, my second guess: POINT.

But wait: are we allowed to use POINT? It is a valid English word? Yes.

So <guess>POINT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word.  
- N is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4).  

For the next guess, the strategy is to:  
- Fix N in position 4 to confirm its location and gather information on other positions.  
- Use letters not previously tested (avoid C, R, A, E) and prioritize common consonants and vowels (e.g., I, O, U).  
- Select a word with all distinct letters to maximize new information gain.  

The word ""POINT"" fits well because:  
- It places N in position 4, ensuring it will get a ✓ if correct.  
- It tests new letters: P (position 1), O (vowel at position 2), I (vowel at position 3), and T (position 5).  
- No duplicated letters mean feedback will be clearer for each position.  
- ""POINT"" uses common letters, increasing the chance of hits and narrowing possibilities.  

This guess will help identify whether P, O, I, or T are in the word and their potential positions.

<guess>POINT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → This means:
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

2. POINT: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x) → This means:
   - N is again in the correct position (position 4) — which we already knew.
   - P, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

So, combining the feedback:
- The secret word has the letter N in the 4th position.
- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

We now know that the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

We need to make a third guess. The word must be 5 letters, with the 4th letter being N, and none of the above letters.

Available letters: We have to avoid C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T. So the available letters are:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also need to consider that the word must have vowels. The vowels we haven't tried are U and sometimes Y (and rarely others, but mainly U and Y). So the word must contain at least one vowel, which could be U or Y.

We know the 4th letter is N, so the word pattern is: _ _ _ N _

We need to choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Uses only the available letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Includes at least one vowel (U or Y) to be a valid English word.

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:
- Ending with ""N"" and having the 4th letter as N? Actually, the 4th letter is N, so the word is ...N. 

Examples:
- SUN: but that's 3 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words with N at position 4:

- BUNCH? But C is eliminated? C is not allowed.
- DUNCE? D,U,N,C,E → C and E are eliminated? Not allowed.
- FUNKY: F,U,N,K,Y → Let's check: F(1), U(2), N(3)? No, we need N at position 4. FUNKY: F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5) → N is at position 3, not 4.

We need the pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

So:
- Position 1: any available letter
- Position 2: any available letter
- Position 3: any available letter
- Position 4: N (fixed)
- Position 5: any available letter

Now, we need to form a valid English word.

Let me list some possibilities:

- Using U as a vowel: 
  - ? U ? N ? 
  - Examples: 
    - BUNCH → but C and H? B(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) → N is at 3, not 4. Wrong pattern.
    - We need the N at 4, so the vowel should be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But position 3 is before N? 

Actually, the vowel can be in any position. But we need the word to have the form ...N.

Let me think of words ending with ""UN"" or similar? But that would be position 4 and 5? Not necessarily.

Better to think of words with N as the fourth letter.

Examples:
- BLANK: B,L,A,N,K → but A is eliminated? A is not allowed.
- FLANK: F,L,A,N,K → A not allowed.
- PLANK: P,L,A,N,K → P and A not allowed.
- THANK: T,H,A,N,K → T and A not allowed.

We need to avoid A and T? So not.

- Using U:
  - DAUNT: D,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - FAULT: F,A,U,L,T → A and T not allowed.
  - GAUNT: G,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - HAUNT: H,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - JAUNT: J,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - VAUNT: V,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.

All these have A and T? T is eliminated? Yes, from POINT feedback.

What about words with U and without A or T?

- BUNGS? B,U,N,G,S → but N is at position 3? B(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),S(5) → not pattern.

We need N at 4? So position 3 must be a letter, then N at 4.

- How about: _ _ U N _ ? That is, U at position 3, then N at 4? So the word has U in the third position.

Examples:
- LUNGS: L,U,N,G,S → L(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),S(5) → N is at 3, not 4? Wrong.

Pattern: position 3 is U, position 4 is N? So the word is: letter1, letter2, U, N, letter5.

Examples:
- Not common? Let me think: 
  - BOUND: B,O,U,N,D → O is eliminated? O not allowed.
  - FOUND: F,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - HOUND: H,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - MOUND: M,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - POUND: P,O,U,N,D → P and O not allowed.
  - ROUND: R,O,U,N,D → R and O not allowed.
  - SOUND: S,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - WOUND: W,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.

All have O? Which is eliminated.

What about with Y? Y can be a vowel.

- Words with Y: 
  - LYNN? Not 5 letters.
  - SYNOD: S,Y,N,O,D → O not allowed? And N is at position 3? S(1),Y(2),N(3),O(4),D(5) → not pattern.

Pattern: ...N. with N at 4.

- STYNY? Not a word? 
- SHINY: S,H,I,N,Y → I is eliminated? I not allowed.

We need to use U or Y without the eliminated letters.

Another idea: the vowel might be in position 1 or 2 or 5.

For example, position 5 could be a vowel? Like U or Y.

Pattern: _ _ _ N U or _ _ _ N Y

Words ending with NU? Not common? Or NY?

- MANU? Not 5 letters.
- MENU: M,E,N,U → E not allowed and 4 letters.

5-letter words ending with NU? I can't think of any.

Ending with NY:
- FUNNY: F,U,N,N,Y → but N is at position 3 and 4? F(1),U(2),N(3),N(4),Y(5) → so position 4 is N? Yes! And it has two N's? But we know N is at position 4, and it might have another N? But we don't know? The feedback for CRANE only showed one N? But it could have more? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? Actually, in CRANE, we had N at position 4 and it was marked ✓, but if there was another N, we wouldn't know? Because we didn't test it? But in POINT, we had N at position 4 and it was ✓, and no other N? But we didn't have N elsewhere? So it's possible that there is another N? But we don't know.

So FUNNY: 
- F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5)
- We know position 4 is N? So the second N (at position 4) is correct? But what about the first N at position 3? If the secret word has only one N, then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two N's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position? Or if the secret has N at position 4, and we have N at position 3 and 4, then position 3 would be marked as '-' if there is another N? But we don't know.

But let's consider: we are allowed to use N again? But we know N is in the word? So we can use it? But in this case, for FUNNY, we are testing F, U, and Y? And also testing if there is another N? But we are not sure.

But we have to avoid eliminated letters? FUNNY: F, U, N, N, Y. U and Y are vowels? F and Y are new? But we have to check if U and Y are available? U is available? Y is available? And F is available? Yes.

But the problem: we are testing two N's? But we know one N is at position 4? So if we guess FUNNY, and the secret word has only one N (at position 4), then:
- Position 1: F → if not in word, x
- Position 2: U → if in word, might be marked
- Position 3: N → but since there is only one N and it's at position 4, this would be marked x? Because the N is already used at position 4? Or marked as absent? Yes, typically, if there is only one N, and we have two in the guess, the first one might be marked absent if not in the word? But position 3: N is not in the word? So x? And position 4: N is correct? ✓? And position 5: Y? 

But if the secret word has two N's, then position 3 N might be marked as '-' if there is an N elsewhere? But we don't know.

However, we are trying to get information? So it might be messy? But we have to guess a word? And FUNNY is a valid word? But let's see if there are better options.

Another word: BUNNY? B,U,N,N,Y → same issue? And B is available? But again, two N's.

We need a word with distinct letters? But it's hard? Because we have to use available letters and have N at position 4.

What about: SULUS? Not a word? 

Another idea: use Y as a vowel in position 5.

Pattern: _ _ _ N Y

Words:
- SUNNY: S,U,N,N,Y → two N's? S(1),U(2),N(3),N(4),Y(5) → position 4 is N? Yes? But again, two N's? And U is at position 2? But we can test U and Y? And S? 

But same duplicate issue? 

- GUNKY: G,U,N,K,Y → G(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → but N is at position 3? Not 4? We need N at position 4? So not.

- JUMBY? Not a word? 

- LUNGY: L,U,N,G,Y → L(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),Y(5) → N at 3? Not 4.

We need to have the third letter be something else, then N at 4.

How about: BUG? Not 5 letters.

Let's search for words with pattern: ??N? and N at position 4.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And must include a vowel: U or Y.

Possible words:
- DUNGY? Not a word? 
- FUNKY: F,U,N,K,Y → N at position 3? F(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → so position 4 is K? But we need position 4 to be N? So not.

I think I'm stuck with words that have N at position 4 and use U or Y.

Another word: MUMMY? M,U,M,M,Y → but N? No N? We need N at position 4? Not.

Perhaps: BUNCH? But N at 3? Not.

Let's think of: the word ""SWUNG"": S,W,U,N,G → S(1),W(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) → yes! N at position 4? And U at position 3? And S, W, G are available? And U is vowel? 

Is ""SWUNG"" a valid word? Yes, past participle of swing? Like ""the door was swung open"".

Letters: S, W, U, N, G? All distinct? S, W, U, N, G? Yes, all distinct? And we haven't tested S, W, U, G? U is new? And we need to test vowels? U is a vowel.

Also, no eliminated letters? S, W, U, G are not in the eliminated set? Eliminated: C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T? So S, W, U, G are all allowed.

Perfect! So we can guess ""SWUNG"".

Another option: ""FLUNG"": F,L,U,N,G → F(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) → also valid? But L is available? Yes? But we haven't tested L? So both are good? But SWUNG has S and W? Which are common? FLUNG has F and L? Also common? 

But we can choose one? Let's go with SWUNG? Or FLUNG? 

Another one: ""SLUNG"": S,L,U,N,G → similar? But L is available? 

But to maximize new letters? We have 6 guesses? So it's okay? 

I think SWUNG is fine? Or perhaps we can choose a word that tests more common letters? S is more common than F? But both are okay.

But let's see: we have to avoid many letters? So SWUNG: S, W, U, N, G.

We can also consider ""STUNG"": but T is eliminated? From POINT, T is absent? So not allowed? STUNG has T? S,T,U,N,G → T is not allowed? So we cannot use T.

Similarly, ""SKUNK"": S,K,U,N,K → duplicate K? And K at position 2 and 5? But we need to test? But duplicate? And not distinct? But it's a word? But we can use? But we want distinct for more information? But not necessary? 

But SKUNK: S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → position 4 is N? Yes? But K appears twice? If we guess, and the secret has K, it might be marked? But we don't know? 

But to keep it simple, let's go with SWUNG? It has distinct letters? And common? 

Another word: ""BULGY""? Not common? 

I think SWUNG is a good choice.

So third guess: SWUNG

But let's write it: S-W-U-N-G

Positions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G

We expect N at position 4 to be ✓? And we test S, W, U, G.

If any of them are in the word, we get feedback.

So <guess>SWUNG</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: POINT**  
  Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is confirmed again at position 4 (no new information here).  
  - P, O, I, T are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Insights
1. **Fixed Position**: The 4th letter is **N**.  
2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T (8 letters eliminated).  
3. **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Vowel Constraint**: Since A, E, I, O are eliminated, the secret word must contain **U** or **Y** (or both) as vowels.  
5. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ _ _ N _`.  

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Prioritize testing new vowels**: Focus on **U** and **Y** (since other vowels are eliminated).  
- **Maximize information**: Use a word with distinct, common letters from the available set to test multiple positions.  
- **Leverage the fixed position**: Keep **N** at position 4 to confirm its placement and focus on other positions.  
- **Avoid eliminated letters**: Ensure no letters from {C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T} are used.  

### Why ""SWUNG""?
- **Word**: SWUNG  
- **Breakdown**:  
  - S (position 1): Common consonant, not tested yet.  
  - W (position 2): Common consonant, not tested.  
  - U (position 3): Untested vowel (critical for validation).  
  - N (position 4): Fixed (expected ✓).  
  - G (position 5): Common consonant, not tested.  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Tests 4 new letters (S, W, U, G), all distinct.  
  - Includes **U** (vowel), addressing the vowel constraint.  
  - Valid English word (past participle of ""swing"").  
  - Efficiently probes positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 with high-frequency letters.  

This guess will clarify:  
- If **S, W, U, or G** are in the secret word.  
- Their positions (via feedback).  
- Whether **U** is the missing vowel.

An optimal first guess often includes vowels and common consonants to test multiple possibilities at once.\n\nAfter considering words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"" is a strong candidate because:\n- It contains two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N) \n- All letters are distinct, avoiding redundant feedback  \n- C, R, A, N, E appear frequently in English words  \n- This combination provides broad coverage for positional feedback  \n\n""Crane"" lets me test:\n- Vowels: A in position 3, E in position 5  \n- Consonants: C (start), R (mid), N (end)  \n\nThe feedback will clarify:  \n- Which consonants exist in the secret word  \n- Vowel presence/position  \n- Several positional relationships  \n\nThis sets up an efficient second guess regardless of the outcome.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nThis means:\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since N is the 4th letter in CRANE: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5).\n- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.\n\nSo the secret word has the letter N in the fourth position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nSince the word must be 5 letters and English, we can deduce:\n- The fourth letter is N.\n- The word does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, E.\n\nWe are making the second guess.\n\nStrategy:\n- We know the fourth letter is N, so we can fix that position to N in our next guess? But note: we are not forced to put N in the fourth position because we are trying to get more information? Actually, we can choose to fix it to confirm or to test other positions.\n\nHowever, note the feedback: N is in the correct position. So in the secret word, position 4 is N. Therefore, for our next guess, if we put N in the fourth position, we can get feedback on the other letters. If we don\'t, then we might get a \'-\' for N elsewhere, but that would be confusing because we know that N is already in position 4 and might not be duplicated? Let me check: the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say that the word has unique letters. So it\'s possible to have duplicate letters.\n\nBut note the feedback: for the first guess, we had one N in the fourth position and it was marked as ✓. And the other letters were absent. So it is possible that the secret word has another N? But the feedback doesn\'t show multiple marks for duplicates? Let me clarify the rules.\n\nThe example: Secret Word: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word but wrong position? Wait, in the example: S is the first letter? Actually, in STORM: S, T, O, R, M. Feedback: S(-) meaning present but wrong position? But in BRISK, there is an S at position 4? So S in STORM is at position 1, but in BRISK it\'s at position 4, so S gets \'-\'.\n\nBut what if there are duplicates? For example, if the secret word is APPLE and we guess PAPER: then the first P would be \'-\' (present but wrong position) because there is a P in secret at position 2? Actually, for APPLE: letters are A, P, P, L, E. Guess PAPER: P in position 1, A in position 2, P in position 3, E in position 4, R in position 5.\n\nFeedback:\n- The secret has P at positions 2 and 3? So for the guess:\n  - Position 1: P -> present? but wrong position? Because secret has P at 2 and 3? Since secret has two P\'s, if guess has a P and it\'s not in the first position, but secret has P elsewhere? Actually, the rule: it marks for each occurrence. Typically, Wordle uses a rule that only marks a letter once if it appears once? Actually no, Wordle handles duplicates: if there is a duplicate in the secret, then both must be accounted for. \n\nBut I don\'t want to complicate. Since we have feedback that N is at position 4 and the others are absent, and no indication of duplicates, we can assume that there might be no other N? But we don\'t know. However, to be safe, let\'s avoid using N in other positions for now? Or we can try to test whether there is another N? But we have limited guesses. Probably not necessary at this point.\n\nGiven that we know:\n- Position 4 is N.\n- The word does not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nSo we need to choose a word that:\n- Has N in the fourth position? Actually, we don\'t have to, but it might be efficient because if we put N in fourth again and it shows ✓ again, we confirm. But we already know position 4 is N. So putting N in fourth will give us ✓ for that, and we can focus on testing other letters.\n\nSo I recommend a guess that has N in the fourth position, and uses other letters that are common and not in the set {C,R,A,E}. This way we get information about other positions.\n\nWhat letters are available? We have eliminated C,R,A,E. So we can use: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nCommon letters to test: S, T, L, O, P, etc.\n\nWe also know that vowels are important: the word must have vowels since it\'s English. The vowels excluding A and E: we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So we should include at least one vowel? But note: the secret word might have no A,E, but must have one of I,O,U,Y or else it wouldn\'t be a word.\n\nSo let\'s pick a word that:\n- Has N in the fourth position.\n- Uses other letters from the available set.\n- Includes at least one vowel (I,O,U, or Y).\n\nPopular words: but avoid letters we\'ve already eliminated.\n\nExample: TUNIC? TUNIC: T,U,N,I,C? But C is eliminated? We know C is absent, so TUNIC has C which is wasted? We shouldn\'t use C again because we know it\'s not in the word.\n\nBetter: words without C, R, A, E.\n\nIdea: words ending with N? So fourth position, then fifth letter. The word is ? ? ? N ? \n\nPossible words: \n- _ _ _ N S? But the fifth letter must be a letter we haven\'t tried? We know E is out? So let\'s avoid S at fifth? Actually, we can use S.\n\nFor the fourth position to be N, and we can try to get the fifth letter.\n\nExamples of words: \n- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> but T is an option? Also, it has I which is a vowel.\n- JOINT: J,O,I,N,T -> similar.\n- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> uses O and U? \n- DONUT: D,O,N,U,T -> wait, DONUT has N at position 3? No: D-O-N-U-T -> position: D(1),O(2),N(3),U(4),T(5) -> but we want N at position 4? So that doesn\'t fix.\n\nWe need a word where N is at position 4: so letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.\n\nExamples:\n- SPOON? S,P,O,O,N -> but N is at position 5? Not 4.\n- PLAN? PLAN is 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n5-letter words with N at position 4? So pattern: ...N.\n\nFor example:\n- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> N is the fourth letter? Positions: P1, O2, I3, N4, T5 -> yes.\n- JOINT: same\n- MOINT? Not a word? But JOINT is valid.\n- FAINT: F,A,I,N,T -> but A is eliminated? We cannot use A because we know A is not in the word? So avoid A.\n- Similarly, PRINT: P,R,I,N,T -> R is eliminated? So no R.\n- So we need a word without C,R,A,E and with N in the fourth position.\n\nPossible words:\n- POINT: letters P,O,I,N,T -> available? P, O, I, T are all new? O and I are vowels? Also T is common.\n- JOINT: J is less common? Probably not as good? But both are valid.\n\nOther words: \n- COUNT: C,O,U,N,T -> C is eliminated? We can\'t use C.\n- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> M is okay? M, O, U, T? O and U are vowels -> valid word.\n- MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> but N? We need N at position 4. MOIST has no N? Wrong.\n\nSo for ...N., examples: \n- POINT: uses P,O,I,T? But O and I are vowels? And P, T consonants? Yes.\n- Also, STINK: S,T,I,N,K -> N is fourth? Positions: S(1),T(2),I(3),N(4),K(5). But I is vowel? And S,T,K are consonants-> valid but has I? \nBut note: we haven\'t tested I, O, U, etc.\n\nWe could use POINT? But let me check: is there a better word?\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that doesn\'t necessarily fix the N? But if we don\'t fix the fourth position, then we can test other positions? But since we know the fourth letter is N, and we test N elsewhere? But we might get feedback that N is present elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to put N at the fourth? However, putting N at fourth will confirm and we can focus on other letters.\n\nIn fact, given that we have fixed one position, it is efficient to build on that.\n\nSo I suggest POINT: uses new letters: P, O, I, T? And N at position 4.\n\nBut POINT has two vowels? O and I? That might be good for information.\n\nAnother option: JOINT? J is less common? So POINT is better? Or MOUNT? MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> vowels O and U? Also good? Both are valid.\n\nLet\'s choose MOUNT? Why? Because it uses U which is another vowel? Not tested yet? Whereas POINT uses O and I? We are testing more vowels? Actually, we have to cover vowels: we know A and E are absent, so the vowels must be among I, O, U? By testing MOUNT, we cover O and U? And in POINT we cover O and I? So both are good? MOUNT also tests M and T? Same as POINT? Except POINT tests I and P, and MOUNT tests U and M.\n\nSince M and P are both common? It\'s a toss-up. I\'ll go with POINT because ""point"" is a very common word? But MOUNT is also common? Actually, both are fine.\n\nAnother idea: SINEW? S,I,N,E,W -> but E is eliminated? We cannot use E? So not.\n\nAvoid using eliminated letters.\n\nSo POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> avoids C,R,A,E? And has O and I? And N fixed at fourth.\n\nBut wait: in POINT, the N is at position four? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to get the fifth letter? For example, words ending in ...NS? But we don\'t know if there is an S? We haven\'t tested S? Also, fifth letter could be anything? So testing the fifth letter is important.\n\nWith POINT, we test:\n- Position1: P\n- Position2: O\n- Position3: I\n- Position4: N (which we know, so we expect ✓ for N at 4? But it will be marked accordingly? Actually, if we put N at position 4 and it is indeed N, we get ✓. We can make that guess? It doesn\'t waste because we get information about positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nSame with MOUNT.\n\nLet me pick POINT? Or another word that avoids duplicate letters? POINT has distinct letters? Yes, all distinct? That is good for maximum information.\n\nBut note: MOUNT has distinct too: M,O,U,N,T? Also distinct? Both are distinct.\n\nI think POINT is slightly better because \'I\' is a very common vowel? And MOUNT has U which is less common? But that might be okay.\n\nBut let\'s see: POINT: P(common), O(common vowel), I(common vowel), N(fixed), T(common)? Also, the fifth letter T? It might be present.\n\nBut alternatively: STINT: S,T,I,N,T -> duplicate T? So not distinct? Avoid.\n\nWe want distinct letters to maximize information? Yes.\n\nBut POINT? Distinct: P,O,I,N,T -> yes.\n\nAnother candidate: JOINS? J,O,I,N,S -> not? JOINS: N is fourth? J(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),S(5)? Then we test J? J is low frequency? So POINT is better? P is better than J? Yes.\n\nSo we\'ll go with POINT.\n\nBut note: the secret word might not contain O or I? We don\'t know? So POINT might reveal.\n\nLet me write: guess POINT.\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- We know the fourth letter is N? So POINT has N at position 4? Yes.\n- We are testing P at position1, O at position2, I at position3, T at position5? Perfect.\n\nSo after guessing, we will get feedback: which of these are ✓, -, or x.\n\nThat will help narrow down.\n\nTherefore, my second guess: POINT.\n\nBut wait: are we allowed to use POINT? It is a valid English word? Yes.\n\nSo <guess>POINT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  \n- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word.  \n- N is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4).  \n\nFor the next guess, the strategy is to:  \n- Fix N in position 4 to confirm its location and gather information on other positions.  \n- Use letters not previously tested (avoid C, R, A, E) and prioritize common consonants and vowels (e.g., I, O, U).  \n- Select a word with all distinct letters to maximize new information gain.  \n\nThe word ""POINT"" fits well because:  \n- It places N in position 4, ensuring it will get a ✓ if correct.  \n- It tests new letters: P (position 1), O (vowel at position 2), I (vowel at position 3), and T (position 5).  \n- No duplicated letters mean feedback will be clearer for each position.  \n- ""POINT"" uses common letters, increasing the chance of hits and narrowing possibilities.  \n\nThis guess will help identify whether P, O, I, or T are in the word and their potential positions.\n\n<guess>POINT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1.

POINT: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x) → This means:\n   - N is again in the correct position (position 4) — which we already knew.\n   - P, O, I, T are not in the word at all.\n\nSo, combining the feedback:\n- The secret word has the letter N in the 4th position.\n- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.\n\nWe now know that the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.\n\nWe need to make a third guess. The word must be 5 letters, with the 4th letter being N, and none of the above letters.\n\nAvailable letters: We have to avoid C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T. So the available letters are:\nB, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also need to consider that the word must have vowels. The vowels we haven\'t tried are U and sometimes Y (and rarely others, but mainly U and Y). So the word must contain at least one vowel, which could be U or Y.\n\nWe know the 4th letter is N, so the word pattern is: _ _ _ N _\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n- Has N in the 4th position.\n- Uses only the available letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n- Includes at least one vowel (U or Y) to be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s think of common words that fit this pattern.\n\nPossible words:\n- Ending with ""N"" and having the 4th letter as N? Actually, the 4th letter is N, so the word is ...N. \n\nExamples:\n- SUN: but that\'s 3 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n5-letter words with N at position 4:\n\n- BUNCH? But C is eliminated? C is not allowed.\n- DUNCE? D,U,N,C,E → C and E are eliminated? Not allowed.\n- FUNKY: F,U,N,K,Y → Let\'s check: F(1), U(2), N(3)? No, we need N at position 4. FUNKY: F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5) → N is at position 3, not 4.\n\nWe need the pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.\n\nSo:\n- Position 1: any available letter\n- Position 2: any available letter\n- Position 3: any available letter\n- Position 4: N (fixed)\n- Position 5: any available letter\n\nNow, we need to form a valid English word.\n\nLet me list some possibilities:\n\n- Using U as a vowel: \n  - ? U ? N ? \n  - Examples: \n    - BUNCH → but C and H? B(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) → N is at 3, not 4. Wrong pattern.\n    - We need the N at 4, so the vowel should be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But position 3 is before N? \n\nActually, the vowel can be in any position. But we need the word to have the form ...N.\n\nLet me think of words ending with ""UN"" or similar? But that would be position 4 and 5? Not necessarily.\n\nBetter to think of words with N as the fourth letter.\n\nExamples:\n- BLANK: B,L,A,N,K → but A is eliminated? A is not allowed.\n- FLANK: F,L,A,N,K → A not allowed.\n- PLANK: P,L,A,N,K → P and A not allowed.\n- THANK: T,H,A,N,K → T and A not allowed.\n\nWe need to avoid A and T? So not.\n\n- Using U:\n  - DAUNT: D,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.\n  - FAULT: F,A,U,L,T → A and T not allowed.\n  - GAUNT: G,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.\n  - HAUNT: H,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.\n  - JAUNT: J,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.\n  - VAUNT: V,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.\n\nAll these have A and T? T is eliminated? Yes, from POINT feedback.\n\nWhat about words with U and without A or T?\n\n- BUNGS? B,U,N,G,S → but N is at position 3? B(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),S(5) → not pattern.\n\nWe need N at 4? So position 3 must be a letter, then N at 4.\n\n- How about: _ _ U N _ ? That is, U at position 3, then N at 4? So the word has U in the third position.\n\nExamples:\n- LUNGS: L,U,N,G,S → L(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),S(5) → N is at 3, not 4? Wrong.\n\nPattern: position 3 is U, position 4 is N? So the word is: letter1, letter2, U, N, letter5.\n\nExamples:\n- Not common? Let me think: \n  - BOUND: B,O,U,N,D → O is eliminated? O not allowed.\n  - FOUND: F,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.\n  - HOUND: H,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.\n  - MOUND: M,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.\n  - POUND: P,O,U,N,D → P and O not allowed.\n  - ROUND: R,O,U,N,D → R and O not allowed.\n  - SOUND: S,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.\n  - WOUND: W,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.\n\nAll have O? Which is eliminated.\n\nWhat about with Y? Y can be a vowel.\n\n- Words with Y: \n  - LYNN? Not 5 letters.\n  - SYNOD: S,Y,N,O,D → O not allowed? And N is at position 3? S(1),Y(2),N(3),O(4),D(5) → not pattern.\n\nPattern: ...N. with N at 4.\n\n- STYNY? Not a word? \n- SHINY: S,H,I,N,Y → I is eliminated? I not allowed.\n\nWe need to use U or Y without the eliminated letters.\n\nAnother idea: the vowel might be in position 1 or 2 or 5.\n\nFor example, position 5 could be a vowel? Like U or Y.\n\nPattern: _ _ _ N U or _ _ _ N Y\n\nWords ending with NU? Not common? Or NY?\n\n- MANU? Not 5 letters.\n- MENU: M,E,N,U → E not allowed and 4 letters.\n\n5-letter words ending with NU? I can\'t think of any.\n\nEnding with NY:\n- FUNNY: F,U,N,N,Y → but N is at position 3 and 4? F(1),U(2),N(3),N(4),Y(5) → so position 4 is N? Yes! And it has two N\'s? But we know N is at position 4, and it might have another N? But we don\'t know? The feedback for CRANE only showed one N? But it could have more? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates? Actually, in CRANE, we had N at position 4 and it was marked ✓, but if there was another N, we wouldn\'t know? Because we didn\'t test it? But in POINT, we had N at position 4 and it was ✓, and no other N? But we didn\'t have N elsewhere? So it\'s possible that there is another N? But we don\'t know.\n\nSo FUNNY: \n- F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5)\n- We know position 4 is N? So the second N (at position 4) is correct? But what about the first N at position 3? If the secret word has only one N, then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two N\'s, then it might be marked as present but wrong position? Or if the secret has N at position 4, and we have N at position 3 and 4, then position 3 would be marked as \'-\' if there is another N? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we are allowed to use N again? But we know N is in the word? So we can use it? But in this case, for FUNNY, we are testing F, U, and Y? And also testing if there is another N? But we are not sure.\n\nBut we have to avoid eliminated letters? FUNNY: F, U, N, N, Y. U and Y are vowels? F and Y are new? But we have to check if U and Y are available? U is available? Y is available? And F is available? Yes.\n\nBut the problem: we are testing two N\'s? But we know one N is at position 4? So if we guess FUNNY, and the secret word has only one N (at position 4), then:\n- Position 1: F → if not in word, x\n- Position 2: U → if in word, might be marked\n- Position 3: N → but since there is only one N and it\'s at position 4, this would be marked x? Because the N is already used at position 4? Or marked as absent? Yes, typically, if there is only one N, and we have two in the guess, the first one might be marked absent if not in the word? But position 3: N is not in the word? So x? And position 4: N is correct? ✓? And position 5: Y? \n\nBut if the secret word has two N\'s, then position 3 N might be marked as \'-\' if there is an N elsewhere? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, we are trying to get information? So it might be messy? But we have to guess a word? And FUNNY is a valid word? But let\'s see if there are better options.\n\nAnother word: BUNNY? B,U,N,N,Y → same issue? And B is available? But again, two N\'s.\n\nWe need a word with distinct letters? But it\'s hard? Because we have to use available letters and have N at position 4.\n\nWhat about: SULUS? Not a word? \n\nAnother idea: use Y as a vowel in position 5.\n\nPattern: _ _ _ N Y\n\nWords:\n- SUNNY: S,U,N,N,Y → two N\'s? S(1),U(2),N(3),N(4),Y(5) → position 4 is N? Yes? But again, two N\'s? And U is at position 2? But we can test U and Y? And S? \n\nBut same duplicate issue? \n\n- GUNKY: G,U,N,K,Y → G(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → but N is at position 3? Not 4? We need N at position 4? So not.\n\n- JUMBY? Not a word? \n\n- LUNGY: L,U,N,G,Y → L(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),Y(5) → N at 3? Not 4.\n\nWe need to have the third letter be something else, then N at 4.\n\nHow about: BUG? Not 5 letters.\n\nLet\'s search for words with pattern: ??N? and N at position 4.\n\nAvailable letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nAnd must include a vowel: U or Y.\n\nPossible words:\n- DUNGY? Not a word? \n- FUNKY: F,U,N,K,Y → N at position 3? F(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → so position 4 is K? But we need position 4 to be N? So not.\n\nI think I\'m stuck with words that have N at position 4 and use U or Y.\n\nAnother word: MUMMY? M,U,M,M,Y → but N? No N? We need N at position 4? Not.\n\nPerhaps: BUNCH? But N at 3? Not.\n\nLet\'s think of: the word ""SWUNG"": S,W,U,N,G → S(1),W(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) → yes! N at position 4? And U at position 3? And S, W, G are available? And U is vowel? \n\nIs ""SWUNG"" a valid word? Yes, past participle of swing? Like ""the door was swung open"".\n\nLetters: S, W, U, N, G? All distinct? S, W, U, N, G? Yes, all distinct? And we haven\'t tested S, W, U, G? U is new? And we need to test vowels? U is a vowel.\n\nAlso, no eliminated letters? S, W, U, G are not in the eliminated set? Eliminated: C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T? So S, W, U, G are all allowed.\n\nPerfect! So we can guess ""SWUNG"".\n\nAnother option: ""FLUNG"": F,L,U,N,G → F(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) → also valid? But L is available? Yes? But we haven\'t tested L? So both are good? But SWUNG has S and W? Which are common? FLUNG has F and L? Also common? \n\nBut we can choose one? Let\'s go with SWUNG? Or FLUNG? \n\nAnother one: ""SLUNG"": S,L,U,N,G → similar? But L is available? \n\nBut to maximize new letters? We have 6 guesses? So it\'s okay? \n\nI think SWUNG is fine? Or perhaps we can choose a word that tests more common letters? S is more common than F? But both are okay.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have to avoid many letters? So SWUNG: S, W, U, N, G.\n\nWe can also consider ""STUNG"": but T is eliminated? From POINT, T is absent? So not allowed? STUNG has T? S,T,U,N,G → T is not allowed? So we cannot use T.\n\nSimilarly, ""SKUNK"": S,K,U,N,K → duplicate K? And K at position 2 and 5? But we need to test? But duplicate? And not distinct? But it\'s a word? But we can use? But we want distinct for more information? But not necessary? \n\nBut SKUNK: S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → position 4 is N? Yes? But K appears twice? If we guess, and the secret has K, it might be marked? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut to keep it simple, let\'s go with SWUNG? It has distinct letters? And common? \n\nAnother word: ""BULGY""? Not common? \n\nI think SWUNG is a good choice.\n\nSo third guess: SWUNG\n\nBut let\'s write it: S-W-U-N-G\n\nPositions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G\n\nWe expect N at position 4 to be ✓? And we test S, W, U, G.\n\nIf any of them are in the word, we get feedback.\n\nSo <guess>SWUNG</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.  \n  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: POINT**  \n  Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - N is confirmed again at position 4 (no new information here).  \n  - P, O, I, T are **not** in the secret word.  \n\n### Key Insights\n1. **Fixed Position**: The 4th letter is **N**.  \n2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T (8 letters eliminated).  \n3. **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n4. **Vowel Constraint**: Since A, E, I, O are eliminated, the secret word must contain **U** or **Y** (or both) as vowels.  \n5. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ _ _ N _`.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3\n- **Prioritize testing new vowels**: Focus on **U** and **Y** (since other vowels are eliminated).  \n- **Maximize information**: Use a word with distinct, common letters from the available set to test multiple positions.  \n- **Leverage the fixed position**: Keep **N** at position 4 to confirm its placement and focus on other positions.  \n- **Avoid eliminated letters**: Ensure no letters from {C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T} are used.  \n\n### Why ""SWUNG""?\n- **Word**: SWUNG  \n- **Breakdown**:  \n  - S (position 1): Common consonant, not tested yet.  \n  - W (position 2): Common consonant, not tested.  \n  - U (position 3): Untested vowel (critical for validation).  \n  - N (position 4): Fixed (expected ✓).  \n  - G (position 5): Common consonant, not tested.  \n- **Advantages**:  \n  - Tests 4 new letters (S, W, U, G), all distinct.  \n  - Includes **U** (vowel), addressing the vowel constraint.  \n  - Valid English word (past participle of ""swing"").  \n  - Efficiently probes positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 with high-frequency letters.  \n\nThis guess will clarify:  \n- If **S, W, U, or G** are in the secret word.  \n- Their positions (via feedback).  \n- Whether **U** is the missing vowel.\n\n<guess>SWUNG</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: SWUNG -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(x) U(✓) N(✓) G(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → N is in the word and in the correct position (4th). C, R, A, E are absent.
2. POINT: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x) → N is again correct at 4th. P, O, I, T are absent.
3. SWUNG: S(✓), W(x), U(✓), N(✓), G(x) → S is in the correct position (1st), U is in the word but in the wrong position (since it was guessed at position 3 but the feedback is U(✓) would mean correct position? Wait, let's check the feedback format.

The feedback for SWUNG: S(✓) W(x) U(✓) N(✓) G(x)

But note: the feedback symbols:
- ✓ : correct letter in correct position.
- - : letter in word but wrong position.
- x : letter not in word.

In the feedback for SWUNG:
- S(✓) means S is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).
- W(x) means W is not in the word.
- U(✓) means U is in the secret word and in the correct position? But we guessed U at position 3, so if U(✓), that means position 3 is U? 
- N(✓) means N is correct at position 4 (as we know).
- G(x) means G is not in the word.

But wait, the feedback says U(✓) for position 3? That would mean the secret word has U at position 3? But we also have S at position 1 and N at position 4.

So the secret word has:
- Position 1: S (from SWUNG feedback)
- Position 3: U? (from U(✓) at position 3)
- Position 4: N

But we don't know position 2 and 5? And we know that W and G are absent.

Also, from previous feedback, we know that C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T are absent.

So the secret word pattern: S _ U N _

We know the 2nd and 5th letters are missing.

Also, the 5th letter is unknown? And we know the word must be English and 5 letters.

Now, what about the U? The feedback says U(✓) at position 3? So position 3 is U? Then the word is S _ U N _

But we also know that from the first guess, we had no U? But we didn't test U until now? So that's fine.

But let me confirm the feedback: in SWUNG, we have:
- Position 1: S → ✓ (so secret has S at 1)
- Position 2: W → x (absent)
- Position 3: U → ✓ (so secret has U at 3)
- Position 4: N → ✓ (as expected)
- Position 5: G → x (absent)

So the secret word is: S, ?, U, N, ? 

Where the second and fifth letters are unknown.

Now, we know the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, W, G. Also, from the first guess, we had N, but we know it's at position 4? And we have U and S now.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z? But we must use only these? And the word must be English.

The word pattern: S _ U N _

Possible letters for position 2: any available consonant? But we need to form a word.

Also, position 5: any available letter? But the word must have a vowel? We have U at position 3, which is a vowel? So the word has a vowel? So the other letters can be consonants? But Y can sometimes be a vowel? But we have U, so it's okay.

Now, what are possible words? S _ U N _

Common words:
- STUN? But that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters? STUN is 4? S-T-U-N? So 4 letters? Not 5.

5-letter words: 
- STUNG? But T is eliminated? From POINT, T is absent? So not.
- SWUNG? But we guessed it? And it's not the secret? Because we got feedback that S and U and N are correct? But W and G are absent? So SWUNG is not the secret? Because we have two x's? So it's not all correct.

So we need a word like S?U N?

Possibilities:
- S H U N ? 
- S K U N ? 
- S L U N ? 
- S M U N ? 
- S B U N ? 
- etc.

But what words exist?

- SHUNT: S,H,U,N,T → but T is eliminated? T is absent? So not.
- SHUNS: S,H,U,N,S → but S is at the end? And we have S at position 1? But SHUNS: S(1),H(2),U(3),N(4),S(5) → so position 5 is S? But we already have S at position 1? And S might be duplicated? But we don't know if the secret has two S's? However, in SWUNG, we had S at position 1 and it was ✓, but we didn't have S elsewhere? So if the secret has two S's, we wouldn't know? But in SHUNS, we are testing S at position 5? But we know S is at position 1? So if we guess SHUNS, and the secret has only one S, then position 5 S would be x? Or if it has two S's, it might be - or ✓? But we don't know.

But let's see: SHUNS is a word? Yes, meaning to avoid or ignore? But T is not used? H is available? But position 5 is S? And we have to avoid eliminated letters? T is eliminated? But SHUNS doesn't have T? It has S,H,U,N,S.

But we have eliminated: C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T,W,G? So H is not eliminated? Yes, H is available.

But we have S at position 1 and 5? So if we guess SHUNS, we are testing H at position 2? And S at position 5? But we already know S is at position 1? So if the secret has only one S, then position 5 S would be x? If it has two, it might be - or ✓? But we don't know.

But we can try? However, we have other options.

Another word: SKUNK? S,K,U,N,K → but K at position 2 and 5? And we have K available? But SKUNK: S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → but we know position 3 is U? So it matches? But we have K twice? And we don't know if K is in the word? But in SWUNG, we didn't test K? So it could be.

But SKUNK has K? And if we guess, we can see? But let's see if there are better words.

Another word: SLUNG? S,L,U,N,G → but G is eliminated? From SWUNG, G is absent? So not.

Similarly, FLUNG: F,L,U,N,G → G absent? And F and L available? But G is absent? So not.

What about: SHULN? Not a word.

Or: S M U N G? But G absent? Not.

Perhaps: S B U N K? SBUNK? Not a word.

S J U N K? SJUNK? Not a word.

S M U N K? SMUNK? Not a word.

S P U N K? But P is eliminated? Not.

Another idea: the fifth letter could be D? S D U N D? Not 5 letters? S,D,U,N,D? D at position 2 and 5? But S(1),D(2),U(3),N(4),D(5) → is that a word? ""Sdund"" not a word.

Perhaps: SOUND? But O is eliminated? Not.

We need to find a word that fits S _ U N _ with available letters.

List of possible words:
- SHUNS: S,H,U,N,S → as above? But we have S at 1 and 5? And H at 2? H is available? And no eliminated letters? So it's possible? But is it a valid word? Yes, ""shuns"" is the third person singular of shun? Like ""he shuns"".

But we have to consider: in the feedback for SWUNG, we had U at position 3 correct? So in SHUNS, position 3 is U? So it matches? And position 4 is N? So the only new thing is position 2: H and position 5: S.

But we already know S is at position 1? So if the secret word has only one S, then position 5 S would be marked as absent? But if it has two S's, it might be present? But we don't know.

But we can guess SHUNS? And see the feedback.

Another word: SKULK? S,K,U,L,K → but position 3 is U? S(1),K(2),U(3),L(4),K(5) → but position 4 is L? But we need position 4 to be N? So not? The pattern is fixed: position 4 is N? So we must have N at 4? So SKULK has L at 4? Not N? So not.

Similarly, SKIMP? But no U? And position 3 is I? I is eliminated? Not.

We need position 3 to be U? Because we have U(✓) at position 3? So the secret has U at position 3? So we must have U at position 3 in our guess? Or we can have it elsewhere? But the feedback says U is in the correct position? So position 3 is U? So we must keep U at position 3? Or we can change? But we know it's fixed? So for the next guess, we should keep U at position 3 and S at position 1 and N at position 4? Because they are correct.

So the guess must have:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 2: some letter from available
- Position 5: some letter from available

And the available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z? And we avoid W, G (from SWUNG feedback), and the previously eliminated.

So for position 2 and 5, we can use: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, what words exist with pattern: S (letter) U N (letter)

Examples:
- SHUNS: S, H, U, N, S → H at 2, S at 5? But S is already at 1? So if the secret has two S's, it might be okay? But we don't know? But let's list possible.

- SHUNK? Not a word? 
- SHUNT: but T eliminated? Not.
- SPUNK: P eliminated? Not.
- SLUNG: G eliminated? Not.
- STUNG: T eliminated? Not.
- SWUNG: we already guessed? And it's not the secret? Because we had W and G absent? And we have S and U correct? But not all.

So what about: 
- S K U N K → SKUNK? Is that a word? Yes, meaning a type of animal? Or to avoid? S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → so K at 2 and 5? And K is available? So we can try SKUNK.

- Or S M U N G? But G eliminated? Not.
- S B U N K? SBUNK? Not a word.
- S D U N K? SDUNK? Not a word.
- S F U N K? SFUNK? Not a word? But ""funk"" is a word, but S FUNK? Not a word? 
- S H U N K? SHUNK? Not a word? But ""shrink"" has R? R eliminated? Not.
- S J U N K? SJUNK? Not a word.
- S L U N K? SLUNK? Yes, past tense of slink? S(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → but position 5 is K? And L at 2? And K at 5? But we have no duplicate? And L and K available? 

SLUNK: S,L,U,N,K → valid word? Yes.

Similarly, SKUNK: S,K,U,N,K → valid? Yes.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid? But SKUNK has duplicate K? So if we guess SKUNK, and the secret has only one K, then one of the K's might be marked? But we can still get information.

But to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters? But in this case, for position 2 and 5, we have to choose two letters? And we have limited choices.

Another word: S M U N K? SMUNK? Not a word? 
- Or S V U N G? Not.
- S Y U N K? SYUNK? Not a word.

So possible words: SHUNS, SKUNK, SLUNK? 

SHUNS: S,H,U,N,S → H at 2, S at 5? But S is duplicate? And we don't know if secret has two S's? But in SWUNG, we had only one S? And it was at position 1? So if the secret has only one S, then position 5 S in SHUNS would be x? And if it has two, it might be - or ✓? But since position 1 is S, if position 5 is also S, it would be ✓ if correct? But we don't know.

But let's consider the feedback we would get.

Perhaps SLUNK is better? Because it has distinct letters: S,L,U,N,K? All distinct? And we test L and K? Both new.

Similarly, SKUNK has K at 2 and 5? So if we guess SKUNK, and the secret has K, then we might get feedback on K? But if it has only one K, then one position might be x? But we don't know which one? But it could be messy? But we can handle.

But for clarity, SLUNK might be better? Because distinct letters.

Another word: S M U N S? SMUNS? Not a word.

Or S B U N S? SBUNS? Not.

So the only common words are SHUNS, SKUNK, SLUNK.

But SHUNS has duplicate S? And we already know S at position 1? So it might not be efficient? Because we are testing S again? But we need to test position 2 and 5.

But let's choose SLUNK: S, L, U, N, K.

Then we test L at position 2 and K at position 5? Both new letters.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, with SKUNK, we test K at position 2 and 5? But if K is in the word, we don't know which position? But we can see the feedback.

But I think SLUNK is better because distinct.

So let's go with SLUNK.

But is there a word with Y? For example, S Y U N something? But S Y U N ? Not common? SYLPH? But no U? And position 3 is not U? We need U at position 3.

So no.

Therefore, I think SLUNK is a good guess.

So fourth guess: SLUNK

But let's write: S-L-U-N-K

Positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:K

We expect S, U, N to be correct? And we test L and K.

So <guess>SLUNK</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: POINT**  
  Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is confirmed at position 4.  
  - P, O, I, T are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 3: SWUNG**  
  Feedback: S(✓), W(x), U(✓), N(✓), G(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 1.  
  - U is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - N is confirmed at position 4.  
  - W and G are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Insights
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 1: **S**  
   - Position 3: **U**  
   - Position 4: **N**  
   - The secret word pattern is: **S _ U N _** (only positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  
2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, W, G (10 letters eliminated).  
3. **Available Letters for Positions 2 and 5**: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - The word must be a valid English 5-letter word.  
   - Position 2 must be a consonant (since U at position 3 is the only vowel so far, and English words require vowels—Y could be a vowel but is less likely here).  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Focus on Positions 2 and 5**: Test high-frequency consonants from the available letters to maximize information.  
- **Prioritize Distinct Letters**: Avoid duplicates to clarify feedback for each position.  
- **Leverage Word Patterns**: The secret word must match the pattern `S _ U N _`. Common English words fitting this include **SLUNK** (past tense of ""slink""), **SHUNS** (third person of ""shun""), or **SKUNK** (an animal).  
- **Opt for SLUNK**:  
  - Tests **L** (position 2) and **K** (position 5), both common consonants not yet tried.  
  - All letters are distinct, ensuring clear feedback.  
  - Validates if **L** or **K** are in the word and their positions.  

### Expected Outcomes
- If **SLUNK** is correct, the game ends.  
- If not, feedback on **L** and **K** will reveal:  
  - Whether **L** is in position 2 (✓ or x).  
  - Whether **K** is in position 5 (✓ or x).  
  - This will reduce possibilities to a very small set (e.g., if both are absent, only words like **SHUNS** or **SMUSH**—but **SMUSH** has U at position 5, conflicting with position 3).  

<guess>SLUNK</guess>",SLUNK,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → N is in the word and in the correct position (4th). C, R, A, E are absent.
2. POINT: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x) → N is again correct at 4th. P, O, I, T are absent.
3. SWUNG: S(✓), W(x), U(✓), N(✓), G(x) → S is in the correct position (1st), U is in the word but in the wrong position (since it was guessed at position 3 but the feedback is U(✓) would mean correct position? Wait, let's check the feedback format.

The feedback for SWUNG: S(✓) W(x) U(✓) N(✓) G(x)

But note: the feedback symbols:
- ✓ : correct letter in correct position.
- - : letter in word but wrong position.
- x : letter not in word.

In the feedback for SWUNG:
- S(✓) means S is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).
- W(x) means W is not in the word.
- U(✓) means U is in the secret word and in the correct position? But we guessed U at position 3, so if U(✓), that means position 3 is U? 
- N(✓) means N is correct at position 4 (as we know).
- G(x) means G is not in the word.

But wait, the feedback says U(✓) for position 3? That would mean the secret word has U at position 3? But we also have S at position 1 and N at position 4.

So the secret word has:
- Position 1: S (from SWUNG feedback)
- Position 3: U? (from U(✓) at position 3)
- Position 4: N

But we don't know position 2 and 5? And we know that W and G are absent.

Also, from previous feedback, we know that C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T are absent.

So the secret word pattern: S _ U N _

We know the 2nd and 5th letters are missing.

Also, the 5th letter is unknown? And we know the word must be English and 5 letters.

Now, what about the U? The feedback says U(✓) at position 3? So position 3 is U? Then the word is S _ U N _

But we also know that from the first guess, we had no U? But we didn't test U until now? So that's fine.

But let me confirm the feedback: in SWUNG, we have:
- Position 1: S → ✓ (so secret has S at 1)
- Position 2: W → x (absent)
- Position 3: U → ✓ (so secret has U at 3)
- Position 4: N → ✓ (as expected)
- Position 5: G → x (absent)

So the secret word is: S, ?, U, N, ? 

Where the second and fifth letters are unknown.

Now, we know the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, W, G. Also, from the first guess, we had N, but we know it's at position 4? And we have U and S now.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z? But we must use only these? And the word must be English.

The word pattern: S _ U N _

Possible letters for position 2: any available consonant? But we need to form a word.

Also, position 5: any available letter? But the word must have a vowel? We have U at position 3, which is a vowel? So the word has a vowel? So the other letters can be consonants? But Y can sometimes be a vowel? But we have U, so it's okay.

Now, what are possible words? S _ U N _

Common words:
- STUN? But that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters? STUN is 4? S-T-U-N? So 4 letters? Not 5.

5-letter words: 
- STUNG? But T is eliminated? From POINT, T is absent? So not.
- SWUNG? But we guessed it? And it's not the secret? Because we got feedback that S and U and N are correct? But W and G are absent? So SWUNG is not the secret? Because we have two x's? So it's not all correct.

So we need a word like S?U N?

Possibilities:
- S H U N ? 
- S K U N ? 
- S L U N ? 
- S M U N ? 
- S B U N ? 
- etc.

But what words exist?

- SHUNT: S,H,U,N,T → but T is eliminated? T is absent? So not.
- SHUNS: S,H,U,N,S → but S is at the end? And we have S at position 1? But SHUNS: S(1),H(2),U(3),N(4),S(5) → so position 5 is S? But we already have S at position 1? And S might be duplicated? But we don't know if the secret has two S's? However, in SWUNG, we had S at position 1 and it was ✓, but we didn't have S elsewhere? So if the secret has two S's, we wouldn't know? But in SHUNS, we are testing S at position 5? But we know S is at position 1? So if we guess SHUNS, and the secret has only one S, then position 5 S would be x? Or if it has two S's, it might be - or ✓? But we don't know.

But let's see: SHUNS is a word? Yes, meaning to avoid or ignore? But T is not used? H is available? But position 5 is S? And we have to avoid eliminated letters? T is eliminated? But SHUNS doesn't have T? It has S,H,U,N,S.

But we have eliminated: C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T,W,G? So H is not eliminated? Yes, H is available.

But we have S at position 1 and 5? So if we guess SHUNS, we are testing H at position 2? And S at position 5? But we already know S is at position 1? So if the secret has only one S, then position 5 S would be x? If it has two, it might be - or ✓? But we don't know.

But we can try? However, we have other options.

Another word: SKUNK? S,K,U,N,K → but K at position 2 and 5? And we have K available? But SKUNK: S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → but we know position 3 is U? So it matches? But we have K twice? And we don't know if K is in the word? But in SWUNG, we didn't test K? So it could be.

But SKUNK has K? And if we guess, we can see? But let's see if there are better words.

Another word: SLUNG? S,L,U,N,G → but G is eliminated? From SWUNG, G is absent? So not.

Similarly, FLUNG: F,L,U,N,G → G absent? And F and L available? But G is absent? So not.

What about: SHULN? Not a word.

Or: S M U N G? But G absent? Not.

Perhaps: S B U N K? SBUNK? Not a word.

S J U N K? SJUNK? Not a word.

S M U N K? SMUNK? Not a word.

S P U N K? But P is eliminated? Not.

Another idea: the fifth letter could be D? S D U N D? Not 5 letters? S,D,U,N,D? D at position 2 and 5? But S(1),D(2),U(3),N(4),D(5) → is that a word? ""Sdund"" not a word.

Perhaps: SOUND? But O is eliminated? Not.

We need to find a word that fits S _ U N _ with available letters.

List of possible words:
- SHUNS: S,H,U,N,S → as above? But we have S at 1 and 5? And H at 2? H is available? And no eliminated letters? So it's possible? But is it a valid word? Yes, ""shuns"" is the third person singular of shun? Like ""he shuns"".

But we have to consider: in the feedback for SWUNG, we had U at position 3 correct? So in SHUNS, position 3 is U? So it matches? And position 4 is N? So the only new thing is position 2: H and position 5: S.

But we already know S is at position 1? So if the secret word has only one S, then position 5 S would be marked as absent? But if it has two S's, it might be present? But we don't know.

But we can guess SHUNS? And see the feedback.

Another word: SKULK? S,K,U,L,K → but position 3 is U? S(1),K(2),U(3),L(4),K(5) → but position 4 is L? But we need position 4 to be N? So not? The pattern is fixed: position 4 is N? So we must have N at 4? So SKULK has L at 4? Not N? So not.

Similarly, SKIMP? But no U? And position 3 is I? I is eliminated? Not.

We need position 3 to be U? Because we have U(✓) at position 3? So the secret has U at position 3? So we must have U at position 3 in our guess? Or we can have it elsewhere? But the feedback says U is in the correct position? So position 3 is U? So we must keep U at position 3? Or we can change? But we know it's fixed? So for the next guess, we should keep U at position 3 and S at position 1 and N at position 4? Because they are correct.

So the guess must have:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 2: some letter from available
- Position 5: some letter from available

And the available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z? And we avoid W, G (from SWUNG feedback), and the previously eliminated.

So for position 2 and 5, we can use: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, what words exist with pattern: S (letter) U N (letter)

Examples:
- SHUNS: S, H, U, N, S → H at 2, S at 5? But S is already at 1? So if the secret has two S's, it might be okay? But we don't know? But let's list possible.

- SHUNK? Not a word? 
- SHUNT: but T eliminated? Not.
- SPUNK: P eliminated? Not.
- SLUNG: G eliminated? Not.
- STUNG: T eliminated? Not.
- SWUNG: we already guessed? And it's not the secret? Because we had W and G absent? And we have S and U correct? But not all.

So what about: 
- S K U N K → SKUNK? Is that a word? Yes, meaning a type of animal? Or to avoid? S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → so K at 2 and 5? And K is available? So we can try SKUNK.

- Or S M U N G? But G eliminated? Not.
- S B U N K? SBUNK? Not a word.
- S D U N K? SDUNK? Not a word.
- S F U N K? SFUNK? Not a word? But ""funk"" is a word, but S FUNK? Not a word? 
- S H U N K? SHUNK? Not a word? But ""shrink"" has R? R eliminated? Not.
- S J U N K? SJUNK? Not a word.
- S L U N K? SLUNK? Yes, past tense of slink? S(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → but position 5 is K? And L at 2? And K at 5? But we have no duplicate? And L and K available? 

SLUNK: S,L,U,N,K → valid word? Yes.

Similarly, SKUNK: S,K,U,N,K → valid? Yes.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid? But SKUNK has duplicate K? So if we guess SKUNK, and the secret has only one K, then one of the K's might be marked? But we can still get information.

But to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters? But in this case, for position 2 and 5, we have to choose two letters? And we have limited choices.

Another word: S M U N K? SMUNK? Not a word? 
- Or S V U N G? Not.
- S Y U N K? SYUNK? Not a word.

So possible words: SHUNS, SKUNK, SLUNK? 

SHUNS: S,H,U,N,S → H at 2, S at 5? But S is duplicate? And we don't know if secret has two S's? But in SWUNG, we had only one S? And it was at position 1? So if the secret has only one S, then position 5 S in SHUNS would be x? And if it has two, it might be - or ✓? But since position 1 is S, if position 5 is also S, it would be ✓ if correct? But we don't know.

But let's consider the feedback we would get.

Perhaps SLUNK is better? Because it has distinct letters: S,L,U,N,K? All distinct? And we test L and K? Both new.

Similarly, SKUNK has K at 2 and 5? So if we guess SKUNK, and the secret has K, then we might get feedback on K? But if it has only one K, then one position might be x? But we don't know which one? But it could be messy? But we can handle.

But for clarity, SLUNK might be better? Because distinct letters.

Another word: S M U N S? SMUNS? Not a word.

Or S B U N S? SBUNS? Not.

So the only common words are SHUNS, SKUNK, SLUNK.

But SHUNS has duplicate S? And we already know S at position 1? So it might not be efficient? Because we are testing S again? But we need to test position 2 and 5.

But let's choose SLUNK: S, L, U, N, K.

Then we test L at position 2 and K at position 5? Both new letters.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, with SKUNK, we test K at position 2 and 5? But if K is in the word, we don't know which position? But we can see the feedback.

But I think SLUNK is better because distinct.

So let's go with SLUNK.

But is there a word with Y? For example, S Y U N something? But S Y U N ? Not common? SYLPH? But no U? And position 3 is not U? We need U at position 3.

So no.

Therefore, I think SLUNK is a good guess.

So fourth guess: SLUNK

But let's write: S-L-U-N-K

Positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:K

We expect S, U, N to be correct? And we test L and K.

So <guess>SLUNK</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: POINT**  
  Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is confirmed at position 4.  
  - P, O, I, T are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 3: SWUNG**  
  Feedback: S(✓), W(x), U(✓), N(✓), G(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 1.  
  - U is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - N is confirmed at position 4.  
  - W and G are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Insights
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 1: **S**  
   - Position 3: **U**  
   - Position 4: **N**  
   - The secret word pattern is: **S _ U N _** (only positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  
2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, W, G (10 letters eliminated).  
3. **Available Letters for Positions 2 and 5**: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - The word must be a valid English 5-letter word.  
   - Position 2 must be a consonant (since U at position 3 is the only vowel so far, and English words require vowels—Y could be a vowel but is less likely here).  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Focus on Positions 2 and 5**: Test high-frequency consonants from the available letters to maximize information.  
- **Prioritize Distinct Letters**: Avoid duplicates to clarify feedback for each position.  
- **Leverage Word Patterns**: The secret word must match the pattern `S _ U N _`. Common English words fitting this include **SLUNK** (past tense of ""slink""), **SHUNS** (third person of ""shun""), or **SKUNK** (an animal).  
- **Opt for SLUNK**:  
  - Tests **L** (position 2) and **K** (position 5), both common consonants not yet tried.  
  - All letters are distinct, ensuring clear feedback.  
  - Validates if **L** or **K** are in the word and their positions.  

### Expected Outcomes
- If **SLUNK** is correct, the game ends.  
- If not, feedback on **L** and **K** will reveal:  
  - Whether **L** is in position 2 (✓ or x).  
  - Whether **K** is in position 5 (✓ or x).  
  - This will reduce possibilities to a very small set (e.g., if both are absent, only words like **SHUNS** or **SMUSH**—but **SMUSH** has U at position 5, conflicting with position 3).",Guess 4: SLUNK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) U(✓) N(✓) K(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. Since we have no prior knowledge of the secret word, we need to make a guess that maximizes the information we can get for the next guess.
 A common strategy is to use a word that includes common letters and distinct letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.

 Let's consider the following: English letters that are frequent include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, N, L).
 We want to get feedback on as many common letters as possible.

 One of the popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T). Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also a good one.

 However, note that we have 6 tries. Let me choose a word that includes a variety of letters.

 I choose: ""CRANE""

 Why?
 - It has two vowels: A, E
 - Three consonants: C, R, N (which are fairly common)
 - All distinct letters: so we can get clear feedback on each.

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain. I should pick a word with common letters to cover frequent vowels and consonants. An optimal first guess often includes vowels and common consonants to test multiple possibilities at once.

After considering words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"" is a strong candidate because:
- It contains two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N) 
- All letters are distinct, avoiding redundant feedback  
- C, R, A, N, E appear frequently in English words  
- This combination provides broad coverage for positional feedback  

""Crane"" lets me test:
- Vowels: A in position 3, E in position 5  
- Consonants: C (start), R (mid), N (end)  

The feedback will clarify:  
- Which consonants exist in the secret word  
- Vowel presence/position  
- Several positional relationships  

This sets up an efficient second guess regardless of the outcome.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
This means:
- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since N is the 4th letter in CRANE: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5).
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word has the letter N in the fourth position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.

Since the word must be 5 letters and English, we can deduce:
- The fourth letter is N.
- The word does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, E.

We are making the second guess.

Strategy:
- We know the fourth letter is N, so we can fix that position to N in our next guess? But note: we are not forced to put N in the fourth position because we are trying to get more information? Actually, we can choose to fix it to confirm or to test other positions.

However, note the feedback: N is in the correct position. So in the secret word, position 4 is N. Therefore, for our next guess, if we put N in the fourth position, we can get feedback on the other letters. If we don't, then we might get a '-' for N elsewhere, but that would be confusing because we know that N is already in position 4 and might not be duplicated? Let me check: the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don't say that the word has unique letters. So it's possible to have duplicate letters.

But note the feedback: for the first guess, we had one N in the fourth position and it was marked as ✓. And the other letters were absent. So it is possible that the secret word has another N? But the feedback doesn't show multiple marks for duplicates? Let me clarify the rules.

The example: Secret Word: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word but wrong position? Wait, in the example: S is the first letter? Actually, in STORM: S, T, O, R, M. Feedback: S(-) meaning present but wrong position? But in BRISK, there is an S at position 4? So S in STORM is at position 1, but in BRISK it's at position 4, so S gets '-'.

But what if there are duplicates? For example, if the secret word is APPLE and we guess PAPER: then the first P would be '-' (present but wrong position) because there is a P in secret at position 2? Actually, for APPLE: letters are A, P, P, L, E. Guess PAPER: P in position 1, A in position 2, P in position 3, E in position 4, R in position 5.

Feedback:
- The secret has P at positions 2 and 3? So for the guess:
  - Position 1: P -> present? but wrong position? Because secret has P at 2 and 3? Since secret has two P's, if guess has a P and it's not in the first position, but secret has P elsewhere? Actually, the rule: it marks for each occurrence. Typically, Wordle uses a rule that only marks a letter once if it appears once? Actually no, Wordle handles duplicates: if there is a duplicate in the secret, then both must be accounted for. 

But I don't want to complicate. Since we have feedback that N is at position 4 and the others are absent, and no indication of duplicates, we can assume that there might be no other N? But we don't know. However, to be safe, let's avoid using N in other positions for now? Or we can try to test whether there is another N? But we have limited guesses. Probably not necessary at this point.

Given that we know:
- Position 4 is N.
- The word does not contain C, R, A, E.

So we need to choose a word that:
- Has N in the fourth position? Actually, we don't have to, but it might be efficient because if we put N in fourth again and it shows ✓ again, we confirm. But we already know position 4 is N. So putting N in fourth will give us ✓ for that, and we can focus on testing other letters.

So I recommend a guess that has N in the fourth position, and uses other letters that are common and not in the set {C,R,A,E}. This way we get information about other positions.

What letters are available? We have eliminated C,R,A,E. So we can use: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Common letters to test: S, T, L, O, P, etc.

We also know that vowels are important: the word must have vowels since it's English. The vowels excluding A and E: we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So we should include at least one vowel? But note: the secret word might have no A,E, but must have one of I,O,U,Y or else it wouldn't be a word.

So let's pick a word that:
- Has N in the fourth position.
- Uses other letters from the available set.
- Includes at least one vowel (I,O,U, or Y).

Popular words: but avoid letters we've already eliminated.

Example: TUNIC? TUNIC: T,U,N,I,C? But C is eliminated? We know C is absent, so TUNIC has C which is wasted? We shouldn't use C again because we know it's not in the word.

Better: words without C, R, A, E.

Idea: words ending with N? So fourth position, then fifth letter. The word is ? ? ? N ? 

Possible words: 
- _ _ _ N S? But the fifth letter must be a letter we haven't tried? We know E is out? So let's avoid S at fifth? Actually, we can use S.

For the fourth position to be N, and we can try to get the fifth letter.

Examples of words: 
- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> but T is an option? Also, it has I which is a vowel.
- JOINT: J,O,I,N,T -> similar.
- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> uses O and U? 
- DONUT: D,O,N,U,T -> wait, DONUT has N at position 3? No: D-O-N-U-T -> position: D(1),O(2),N(3),U(4),T(5) -> but we want N at position 4? So that doesn't fix.

We need a word where N is at position 4: so letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

Examples:
- SPOON? S,P,O,O,N -> but N is at position 5? Not 4.
- PLAN? PLAN is 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words with N at position 4? So pattern: ...N.

For example:
- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> N is the fourth letter? Positions: P1, O2, I3, N4, T5 -> yes.
- JOINT: same
- MOINT? Not a word? But JOINT is valid.
- FAINT: F,A,I,N,T -> but A is eliminated? We cannot use A because we know A is not in the word? So avoid A.
- Similarly, PRINT: P,R,I,N,T -> R is eliminated? So no R.
- So we need a word without C,R,A,E and with N in the fourth position.

Possible words:
- POINT: letters P,O,I,N,T -> available? P, O, I, T are all new? O and I are vowels? Also T is common.
- JOINT: J is less common? Probably not as good? But both are valid.

Other words: 
- COUNT: C,O,U,N,T -> C is eliminated? We can't use C.
- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> M is okay? M, O, U, T? O and U are vowels -> valid word.
- MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> but N? We need N at position 4. MOIST has no N? Wrong.

So for ...N., examples: 
- POINT: uses P,O,I,T? But O and I are vowels? And P, T consonants? Yes.
- Also, STINK: S,T,I,N,K -> N is fourth? Positions: S(1),T(2),I(3),N(4),K(5). But I is vowel? And S,T,K are consonants-> valid but has I? 
But note: we haven't tested I, O, U, etc.

We could use POINT? But let me check: is there a better word?

Alternatively, we could use a word that doesn't necessarily fix the N? But if we don't fix the fourth position, then we can test other positions? But since we know the fourth letter is N, and we test N elsewhere? But we might get feedback that N is present elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to put N at the fourth? However, putting N at fourth will confirm and we can focus on other letters.

In fact, given that we have fixed one position, it is efficient to build on that.

So I suggest POINT: uses new letters: P, O, I, T? And N at position 4.

But POINT has two vowels? O and I? That might be good for information.

Another option: JOINT? J is less common? So POINT is better? Or MOUNT? MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> vowels O and U? Also good? Both are valid.

Let's choose MOUNT? Why? Because it uses U which is another vowel? Not tested yet? Whereas POINT uses O and I? We are testing more vowels? Actually, we have to cover vowels: we know A and E are absent, so the vowels must be among I, O, U? By testing MOUNT, we cover O and U? And in POINT we cover O and I? So both are good? MOUNT also tests M and T? Same as POINT? Except POINT tests I and P, and MOUNT tests U and M.

Since M and P are both common? It's a toss-up. I'll go with POINT because ""point"" is a very common word? But MOUNT is also common? Actually, both are fine.

Another idea: SINEW? S,I,N,E,W -> but E is eliminated? We cannot use E? So not.

Avoid using eliminated letters.

So POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> avoids C,R,A,E? And has O and I? And N fixed at fourth.

But wait: in POINT, the N is at position four? Yes.

Alternatively, we could try to get the fifth letter? For example, words ending in ...NS? But we don't know if there is an S? We haven't tested S? Also, fifth letter could be anything? So testing the fifth letter is important.

With POINT, we test:
- Position1: P
- Position2: O
- Position3: I
- Position4: N (which we know, so we expect ✓ for N at 4? But it will be marked accordingly? Actually, if we put N at position 4 and it is indeed N, we get ✓. We can make that guess? It doesn't waste because we get information about positions 1,2,3,5.

Same with MOUNT.

Let me pick POINT? Or another word that avoids duplicate letters? POINT has distinct letters? Yes, all distinct? That is good for maximum information.

But note: MOUNT has distinct too: M,O,U,N,T? Also distinct? Both are distinct.

I think POINT is slightly better because 'I' is a very common vowel? And MOUNT has U which is less common? But that might be okay.

But let's see: POINT: P(common), O(common vowel), I(common vowel), N(fixed), T(common)? Also, the fifth letter T? It might be present.

But alternatively: STINT: S,T,I,N,T -> duplicate T? So not distinct? Avoid.

We want distinct letters to maximize information? Yes.

But POINT? Distinct: P,O,I,N,T -> yes.

Another candidate: JOINS? J,O,I,N,S -> not? JOINS: N is fourth? J(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),S(5)? Then we test J? J is low frequency? So POINT is better? P is better than J? Yes.

So we'll go with POINT.

But note: the secret word might not contain O or I? We don't know? So POINT might reveal.

Let me write: guess POINT.

But let me confirm: 
- We know the fourth letter is N? So POINT has N at position 4? Yes.
- We are testing P at position1, O at position2, I at position3, T at position5? Perfect.

So after guessing, we will get feedback: which of these are ✓, -, or x.

That will help narrow down.

Therefore, my second guess: POINT.

But wait: are we allowed to use POINT? It is a valid English word? Yes.

So <guess>POINT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word.  
- N is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4).  

For the next guess, the strategy is to:  
- Fix N in position 4 to confirm its location and gather information on other positions.  
- Use letters not previously tested (avoid C, R, A, E) and prioritize common consonants and vowels (e.g., I, O, U).  
- Select a word with all distinct letters to maximize new information gain.  

The word ""POINT"" fits well because:  
- It places N in position 4, ensuring it will get a ✓ if correct.  
- It tests new letters: P (position 1), O (vowel at position 2), I (vowel at position 3), and T (position 5).  
- No duplicated letters mean feedback will be clearer for each position.  
- ""POINT"" uses common letters, increasing the chance of hits and narrowing possibilities.  

This guess will help identify whether P, O, I, or T are in the word and their potential positions.

<guess>POINT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → This means:
   - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
   - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.

2. POINT: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x) → This means:
   - N is again in the correct position (position 4) — which we already knew.
   - P, O, I, T are not in the word at all.

So, combining the feedback:
- The secret word has the letter N in the 4th position.
- The following letters are absent: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

We now know that the secret word does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T.

We need to make a third guess. The word must be 5 letters, with the 4th letter being N, and none of the above letters.

Available letters: We have to avoid C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T. So the available letters are:
B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also need to consider that the word must have vowels. The vowels we haven't tried are U and sometimes Y (and rarely others, but mainly U and Y). So the word must contain at least one vowel, which could be U or Y.

We know the 4th letter is N, so the word pattern is: _ _ _ N _

We need to choose a word that:
- Has N in the 4th position.
- Uses only the available letters (B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).
- Includes at least one vowel (U or Y) to be a valid English word.

Let's think of common words that fit this pattern.

Possible words:
- Ending with ""N"" and having the 4th letter as N? Actually, the 4th letter is N, so the word is ...N. 

Examples:
- SUN: but that's 3 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words with N at position 4:

- BUNCH? But C is eliminated? C is not allowed.
- DUNCE? D,U,N,C,E → C and E are eliminated? Not allowed.
- FUNKY: F,U,N,K,Y → Let's check: F(1), U(2), N(3)? No, we need N at position 4. FUNKY: F(1), U(2), N(3), K(4), Y(5) → N is at position 3, not 4.

We need the pattern: letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.

So:
- Position 1: any available letter
- Position 2: any available letter
- Position 3: any available letter
- Position 4: N (fixed)
- Position 5: any available letter

Now, we need to form a valid English word.

Let me list some possibilities:

- Using U as a vowel: 
  - ? U ? N ? 
  - Examples: 
    - BUNCH → but C and H? B(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) → N is at 3, not 4. Wrong pattern.
    - We need the N at 4, so the vowel should be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But position 3 is before N? 

Actually, the vowel can be in any position. But we need the word to have the form ...N.

Let me think of words ending with ""UN"" or similar? But that would be position 4 and 5? Not necessarily.

Better to think of words with N as the fourth letter.

Examples:
- BLANK: B,L,A,N,K → but A is eliminated? A is not allowed.
- FLANK: F,L,A,N,K → A not allowed.
- PLANK: P,L,A,N,K → P and A not allowed.
- THANK: T,H,A,N,K → T and A not allowed.

We need to avoid A and T? So not.

- Using U:
  - DAUNT: D,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - FAULT: F,A,U,L,T → A and T not allowed.
  - GAUNT: G,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - HAUNT: H,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - JAUNT: J,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.
  - VAUNT: V,A,U,N,T → A and T not allowed.

All these have A and T? T is eliminated? Yes, from POINT feedback.

What about words with U and without A or T?

- BUNGS? B,U,N,G,S → but N is at position 3? B(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),S(5) → not pattern.

We need N at 4? So position 3 must be a letter, then N at 4.

- How about: _ _ U N _ ? That is, U at position 3, then N at 4? So the word has U in the third position.

Examples:
- LUNGS: L,U,N,G,S → L(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),S(5) → N is at 3, not 4? Wrong.

Pattern: position 3 is U, position 4 is N? So the word is: letter1, letter2, U, N, letter5.

Examples:
- Not common? Let me think: 
  - BOUND: B,O,U,N,D → O is eliminated? O not allowed.
  - FOUND: F,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - HOUND: H,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - MOUND: M,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - POUND: P,O,U,N,D → P and O not allowed.
  - ROUND: R,O,U,N,D → R and O not allowed.
  - SOUND: S,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.
  - WOUND: W,O,U,N,D → O not allowed.

All have O? Which is eliminated.

What about with Y? Y can be a vowel.

- Words with Y: 
  - LYNN? Not 5 letters.
  - SYNOD: S,Y,N,O,D → O not allowed? And N is at position 3? S(1),Y(2),N(3),O(4),D(5) → not pattern.

Pattern: ...N. with N at 4.

- STYNY? Not a word? 
- SHINY: S,H,I,N,Y → I is eliminated? I not allowed.

We need to use U or Y without the eliminated letters.

Another idea: the vowel might be in position 1 or 2 or 5.

For example, position 5 could be a vowel? Like U or Y.

Pattern: _ _ _ N U or _ _ _ N Y

Words ending with NU? Not common? Or NY?

- MANU? Not 5 letters.
- MENU: M,E,N,U → E not allowed and 4 letters.

5-letter words ending with NU? I can't think of any.

Ending with NY:
- FUNNY: F,U,N,N,Y → but N is at position 3 and 4? F(1),U(2),N(3),N(4),Y(5) → so position 4 is N? Yes! And it has two N's? But we know N is at position 4, and it might have another N? But we don't know? The feedback for CRANE only showed one N? But it could have more? The feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates? Actually, in CRANE, we had N at position 4 and it was marked ✓, but if there was another N, we wouldn't know? Because we didn't test it? But in POINT, we had N at position 4 and it was ✓, and no other N? But we didn't have N elsewhere? So it's possible that there is another N? But we don't know.

So FUNNY: 
- F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5)
- We know position 4 is N? So the second N (at position 4) is correct? But what about the first N at position 3? If the secret word has only one N, then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two N's, then it might be marked as present but wrong position? Or if the secret has N at position 4, and we have N at position 3 and 4, then position 3 would be marked as '-' if there is another N? But we don't know.

But let's consider: we are allowed to use N again? But we know N is in the word? So we can use it? But in this case, for FUNNY, we are testing F, U, and Y? And also testing if there is another N? But we are not sure.

But we have to avoid eliminated letters? FUNNY: F, U, N, N, Y. U and Y are vowels? F and Y are new? But we have to check if U and Y are available? U is available? Y is available? And F is available? Yes.

But the problem: we are testing two N's? But we know one N is at position 4? So if we guess FUNNY, and the secret word has only one N (at position 4), then:
- Position 1: F → if not in word, x
- Position 2: U → if in word, might be marked
- Position 3: N → but since there is only one N and it's at position 4, this would be marked x? Because the N is already used at position 4? Or marked as absent? Yes, typically, if there is only one N, and we have two in the guess, the first one might be marked absent if not in the word? But position 3: N is not in the word? So x? And position 4: N is correct? ✓? And position 5: Y? 

But if the secret word has two N's, then position 3 N might be marked as '-' if there is an N elsewhere? But we don't know.

However, we are trying to get information? So it might be messy? But we have to guess a word? And FUNNY is a valid word? But let's see if there are better options.

Another word: BUNNY? B,U,N,N,Y → same issue? And B is available? But again, two N's.

We need a word with distinct letters? But it's hard? Because we have to use available letters and have N at position 4.

What about: SULUS? Not a word? 

Another idea: use Y as a vowel in position 5.

Pattern: _ _ _ N Y

Words:
- SUNNY: S,U,N,N,Y → two N's? S(1),U(2),N(3),N(4),Y(5) → position 4 is N? Yes? But again, two N's? And U is at position 2? But we can test U and Y? And S? 

But same duplicate issue? 

- GUNKY: G,U,N,K,Y → G(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → but N is at position 3? Not 4? We need N at position 4? So not.

- JUMBY? Not a word? 

- LUNGY: L,U,N,G,Y → L(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),Y(5) → N at 3? Not 4.

We need to have the third letter be something else, then N at 4.

How about: BUG? Not 5 letters.

Let's search for words with pattern: ??N? and N at position 4.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

And must include a vowel: U or Y.

Possible words:
- DUNGY? Not a word? 
- FUNKY: F,U,N,K,Y → N at position 3? F(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → so position 4 is K? But we need position 4 to be N? So not.

I think I'm stuck with words that have N at position 4 and use U or Y.

Another word: MUMMY? M,U,M,M,Y → but N? No N? We need N at position 4? Not.

Perhaps: BUNCH? But N at 3? Not.

Let's think of: the word ""SWUNG"": S,W,U,N,G → S(1),W(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) → yes! N at position 4? And U at position 3? And S, W, G are available? And U is vowel? 

Is ""SWUNG"" a valid word? Yes, past participle of swing? Like ""the door was swung open"".

Letters: S, W, U, N, G? All distinct? S, W, U, N, G? Yes, all distinct? And we haven't tested S, W, U, G? U is new? And we need to test vowels? U is a vowel.

Also, no eliminated letters? S, W, U, G are not in the eliminated set? Eliminated: C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T? So S, W, U, G are all allowed.

Perfect! So we can guess ""SWUNG"".

Another option: ""FLUNG"": F,L,U,N,G → F(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) → also valid? But L is available? Yes? But we haven't tested L? So both are good? But SWUNG has S and W? Which are common? FLUNG has F and L? Also common? 

But we can choose one? Let's go with SWUNG? Or FLUNG? 

Another one: ""SLUNG"": S,L,U,N,G → similar? But L is available? 

But to maximize new letters? We have 6 guesses? So it's okay? 

I think SWUNG is fine? Or perhaps we can choose a word that tests more common letters? S is more common than F? But both are okay.

But let's see: we have to avoid many letters? So SWUNG: S, W, U, N, G.

We can also consider ""STUNG"": but T is eliminated? From POINT, T is absent? So not allowed? STUNG has T? S,T,U,N,G → T is not allowed? So we cannot use T.

Similarly, ""SKUNK"": S,K,U,N,K → duplicate K? And K at position 2 and 5? But we need to test? But duplicate? And not distinct? But it's a word? But we can use? But we want distinct for more information? But not necessary? 

But SKUNK: S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → position 4 is N? Yes? But K appears twice? If we guess, and the secret has K, it might be marked? But we don't know? 

But to keep it simple, let's go with SWUNG? It has distinct letters? And common? 

Another word: ""BULGY""? Not common? 

I think SWUNG is a good choice.

So third guess: SWUNG

But let's write it: S-W-U-N-G

Positions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G

We expect N at position 4 to be ✓? And we test S, W, U, G.

If any of them are in the word, we get feedback.

So <guess>SWUNG</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Guess 1: CRANE**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: POINT**  
  Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - N is confirmed again at position 4 (no new information here).  
  - P, O, I, T are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Insights
1. **Fixed Position**: The 4th letter is **N**.  
2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T (8 letters eliminated).  
3. **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Vowel Constraint**: Since A, E, I, O are eliminated, the secret word must contain **U** or **Y** (or both) as vowels.  
5. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ _ _ N _`.  

### Strategy for Guess 3
- **Prioritize testing new vowels**: Focus on **U** and **Y** (since other vowels are eliminated).  
- **Maximize information**: Use a word with distinct, common letters from the available set to test multiple positions.  
- **Leverage the fixed position**: Keep **N** at position 4 to confirm its placement and focus on other positions.  
- **Avoid eliminated letters**: Ensure no letters from {C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T} are used.  

### Why ""SWUNG""?
- **Word**: SWUNG  
- **Breakdown**:  
  - S (position 1): Common consonant, not tested yet.  
  - W (position 2): Common consonant, not tested.  
  - U (position 3): Untested vowel (critical for validation).  
  - N (position 4): Fixed (expected ✓).  
  - G (position 5): Common consonant, not tested.  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Tests 4 new letters (S, W, U, G), all distinct.  
  - Includes **U** (vowel), addressing the vowel constraint.  
  - Valid English word (past participle of ""swing"").  
  - Efficiently probes positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 with high-frequency letters.  

This guess will clarify:  
- If **S, W, U, or G** are in the secret word.  
- Their positions (via feedback).  
- Whether **U** is the missing vowel.

<guess>SWUNG</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: SWUNG -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(x) U(✓) N(✓) G(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → N is in the word and in the correct position (4th). C, R, A, E are absent.
2. POINT: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x) → N is again correct at 4th. P, O, I, T are absent.
3. SWUNG: S(✓), W(x), U(✓), N(✓), G(x) → S is in the correct position (1st), U is in the word but in the wrong position (since it was guessed at position 3 but the feedback is U(✓) would mean correct position? Wait, let's check the feedback format.

The feedback for SWUNG: S(✓) W(x) U(✓) N(✓) G(x)

But note: the feedback symbols:
- ✓ : correct letter in correct position.
- - : letter in word but wrong position.
- x : letter not in word.

In the feedback for SWUNG:
- S(✓) means S is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).
- W(x) means W is not in the word.
- U(✓) means U is in the secret word and in the correct position? But we guessed U at position 3, so if U(✓), that means position 3 is U? 
- N(✓) means N is correct at position 4 (as we know).
- G(x) means G is not in the word.

But wait, the feedback says U(✓) for position 3? That would mean the secret word has U at position 3? But we also have S at position 1 and N at position 4.

So the secret word has:
- Position 1: S (from SWUNG feedback)
- Position 3: U? (from U(✓) at position 3)
- Position 4: N

But we don't know position 2 and 5? And we know that W and G are absent.

Also, from previous feedback, we know that C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T are absent.

So the secret word pattern: S _ U N _

We know the 2nd and 5th letters are missing.

Also, the 5th letter is unknown? And we know the word must be English and 5 letters.

Now, what about the U? The feedback says U(✓) at position 3? So position 3 is U? Then the word is S _ U N _

But we also know that from the first guess, we had no U? But we didn't test U until now? So that's fine.

But let me confirm the feedback: in SWUNG, we have:
- Position 1: S → ✓ (so secret has S at 1)
- Position 2: W → x (absent)
- Position 3: U → ✓ (so secret has U at 3)
- Position 4: N → ✓ (as expected)
- Position 5: G → x (absent)

So the secret word is: S, ?, U, N, ? 

Where the second and fifth letters are unknown.

Now, we know the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, W, G. Also, from the first guess, we had N, but we know it's at position 4? And we have U and S now.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z? But we must use only these? And the word must be English.

The word pattern: S _ U N _

Possible letters for position 2: any available consonant? But we need to form a word.

Also, position 5: any available letter? But the word must have a vowel? We have U at position 3, which is a vowel? So the word has a vowel? So the other letters can be consonants? But Y can sometimes be a vowel? But we have U, so it's okay.

Now, what are possible words? S _ U N _

Common words:
- STUN? But that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters? STUN is 4? S-T-U-N? So 4 letters? Not 5.

5-letter words: 
- STUNG? But T is eliminated? From POINT, T is absent? So not.
- SWUNG? But we guessed it? And it's not the secret? Because we got feedback that S and U and N are correct? But W and G are absent? So SWUNG is not the secret? Because we have two x's? So it's not all correct.

So we need a word like S?U N?

Possibilities:
- S H U N ? 
- S K U N ? 
- S L U N ? 
- S M U N ? 
- S B U N ? 
- etc.

But what words exist?

- SHUNT: S,H,U,N,T → but T is eliminated? T is absent? So not.
- SHUNS: S,H,U,N,S → but S is at the end? And we have S at position 1? But SHUNS: S(1),H(2),U(3),N(4),S(5) → so position 5 is S? But we already have S at position 1? And S might be duplicated? But we don't know if the secret has two S's? However, in SWUNG, we had S at position 1 and it was ✓, but we didn't have S elsewhere? So if the secret has two S's, we wouldn't know? But in SHUNS, we are testing S at position 5? But we know S is at position 1? So if we guess SHUNS, and the secret has only one S, then position 5 S would be x? Or if it has two S's, it might be - or ✓? But we don't know.

But let's see: SHUNS is a word? Yes, meaning to avoid or ignore? But T is not used? H is available? But position 5 is S? And we have to avoid eliminated letters? T is eliminated? But SHUNS doesn't have T? It has S,H,U,N,S.

But we have eliminated: C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T,W,G? So H is not eliminated? Yes, H is available.

But we have S at position 1 and 5? So if we guess SHUNS, we are testing H at position 2? And S at position 5? But we already know S is at position 1? So if the secret has only one S, then position 5 S would be x? If it has two, it might be - or ✓? But we don't know.

But we can try? However, we have other options.

Another word: SKUNK? S,K,U,N,K → but K at position 2 and 5? And we have K available? But SKUNK: S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → but we know position 3 is U? So it matches? But we have K twice? And we don't know if K is in the word? But in SWUNG, we didn't test K? So it could be.

But SKUNK has K? And if we guess, we can see? But let's see if there are better words.

Another word: SLUNG? S,L,U,N,G → but G is eliminated? From SWUNG, G is absent? So not.

Similarly, FLUNG: F,L,U,N,G → G absent? And F and L available? But G is absent? So not.

What about: SHULN? Not a word.

Or: S M U N G? But G absent? Not.

Perhaps: S B U N K? SBUNK? Not a word.

S J U N K? SJUNK? Not a word.

S M U N K? SMUNK? Not a word.

S P U N K? But P is eliminated? Not.

Another idea: the fifth letter could be D? S D U N D? Not 5 letters? S,D,U,N,D? D at position 2 and 5? But S(1),D(2),U(3),N(4),D(5) → is that a word? ""Sdund"" not a word.

Perhaps: SOUND? But O is eliminated? Not.

We need to find a word that fits S _ U N _ with available letters.

List of possible words:
- SHUNS: S,H,U,N,S → as above? But we have S at 1 and 5? And H at 2? H is available? And no eliminated letters? So it's possible? But is it a valid word? Yes, ""shuns"" is the third person singular of shun? Like ""he shuns"".

But we have to consider: in the feedback for SWUNG, we had U at position 3 correct? So in SHUNS, position 3 is U? So it matches? And position 4 is N? So the only new thing is position 2: H and position 5: S.

But we already know S is at position 1? So if the secret word has only one S, then position 5 S would be marked as absent? But if it has two S's, it might be present? But we don't know.

But we can guess SHUNS? And see the feedback.

Another word: SKULK? S,K,U,L,K → but position 3 is U? S(1),K(2),U(3),L(4),K(5) → but position 4 is L? But we need position 4 to be N? So not? The pattern is fixed: position 4 is N? So we must have N at 4? So SKULK has L at 4? Not N? So not.

Similarly, SKIMP? But no U? And position 3 is I? I is eliminated? Not.

We need position 3 to be U? Because we have U(✓) at position 3? So the secret has U at position 3? So we must have U at position 3 in our guess? Or we can have it elsewhere? But the feedback says U is in the correct position? So position 3 is U? So we must keep U at position 3? Or we can change? But we know it's fixed? So for the next guess, we should keep U at position 3 and S at position 1 and N at position 4? Because they are correct.

So the guess must have:
- Position 1: S
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 2: some letter from available
- Position 5: some letter from available

And the available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z? And we avoid W, G (from SWUNG feedback), and the previously eliminated.

So for position 2 and 5, we can use: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, what words exist with pattern: S (letter) U N (letter)

Examples:
- SHUNS: S, H, U, N, S → H at 2, S at 5? But S is already at 1? So if the secret has two S's, it might be okay? But we don't know? But let's list possible.

- SHUNK? Not a word? 
- SHUNT: but T eliminated? Not.
- SPUNK: P eliminated? Not.
- SLUNG: G eliminated? Not.
- STUNG: T eliminated? Not.
- SWUNG: we already guessed? And it's not the secret? Because we had W and G absent? And we have S and U correct? But not all.

So what about: 
- S K U N K → SKUNK? Is that a word? Yes, meaning a type of animal? Or to avoid? S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → so K at 2 and 5? And K is available? So we can try SKUNK.

- Or S M U N G? But G eliminated? Not.
- S B U N K? SBUNK? Not a word.
- S D U N K? SDUNK? Not a word.
- S F U N K? SFUNK? Not a word? But ""funk"" is a word, but S FUNK? Not a word? 
- S H U N K? SHUNK? Not a word? But ""shrink"" has R? R eliminated? Not.
- S J U N K? SJUNK? Not a word.
- S L U N K? SLUNK? Yes, past tense of slink? S(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → but position 5 is K? And L at 2? And K at 5? But we have no duplicate? And L and K available? 

SLUNK: S,L,U,N,K → valid word? Yes.

Similarly, SKUNK: S,K,U,N,K → valid? Yes.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid? But SKUNK has duplicate K? So if we guess SKUNK, and the secret has only one K, then one of the K's might be marked? But we can still get information.

But to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters? But in this case, for position 2 and 5, we have to choose two letters? And we have limited choices.

Another word: S M U N K? SMUNK? Not a word? 
- Or S V U N G? Not.
- S Y U N K? SYUNK? Not a word.

So possible words: SHUNS, SKUNK, SLUNK? 

SHUNS: S,H,U,N,S → H at 2, S at 5? But S is duplicate? And we don't know if secret has two S's? But in SWUNG, we had only one S? And it was at position 1? So if the secret has only one S, then position 5 S in SHUNS would be x? And if it has two, it might be - or ✓? But since position 1 is S, if position 5 is also S, it would be ✓ if correct? But we don't know.

But let's consider the feedback we would get.

Perhaps SLUNK is better? Because it has distinct letters: S,L,U,N,K? All distinct? And we test L and K? Both new.

Similarly, SKUNK has K at 2 and 5? So if we guess SKUNK, and the secret has K, then we might get feedback on K? But if it has only one K, then one position might be x? But we don't know which one? But it could be messy? But we can handle.

But for clarity, SLUNK might be better? Because distinct letters.

Another word: S M U N S? SMUNS? Not a word.

Or S B U N S? SBUNS? Not.

So the only common words are SHUNS, SKUNK, SLUNK.

But SHUNS has duplicate S? And we already know S at position 1? So it might not be efficient? Because we are testing S again? But we need to test position 2 and 5.

But let's choose SLUNK: S, L, U, N, K.

Then we test L at position 2 and K at position 5? Both new letters.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

Similarly, with SKUNK, we test K at position 2 and 5? But if K is in the word, we don't know which position? But we can see the feedback.

But I think SLUNK is better because distinct.

So let's go with SLUNK.

But is there a word with Y? For example, S Y U N something? But S Y U N ? Not common? SYLPH? But no U? And position 3 is not U? We need U at position 3.

So no.

Therefore, I think SLUNK is a good guess.

So fourth guess: SLUNK

But let's write: S-L-U-N-K

Positions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:K

We expect S, U, N to be correct? And we test L and K.

So <guess>SLUNK</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 2: POINT**  
  Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)

  - N is confirmed at position 4.  
  - P, O, I, T are **not** in the secret word.  

- **Guess 3: SWUNG**  
  Feedback: S(✓), W(x), U(✓), N(✓), G(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 1.  
  - U is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - N is confirmed at position 4.  
  - W and G are **not** in the secret word.  

### Key Insights
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 1: **S**  
   - Position 3: **U**  
   - Position 4: **N**  
   - The secret word pattern is: **S _ U N _** (only positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  
2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, W, G (10 letters eliminated).  
3. **Available Letters for Positions 2 and 5**: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.  
4. **Constraints**:  
   - The word must be a valid English 5-letter word.  
   - Position 2 must be a consonant (since U at position 3 is the only vowel so far, and English words require vowels—Y could be a vowel but is less likely here).  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Focus on Positions 2 and 5**: Test high-frequency consonants from the available letters to maximize information.  
- **Prioritize Distinct Letters**: Avoid duplicates to clarify feedback for each position.  
- **Leverage Word Patterns**: The secret word must match the pattern `S _ U N _`. Common English words fitting this include **SLUNK** (past tense of ""slink""), **SHUNS** (third person of ""shun""), or **SKUNK** (an animal).  
- **Opt for SLUNK**:  
  - Tests **L** (position 2) and **K** (position 5), both common consonants not yet tried.  
  - All letters are distinct, ensuring clear feedback.  
  - Validates if **L** or **K** are in the word and their positions.  

### Expected Outcomes
- If **SLUNK** is correct, the game ends.  
- If not, feedback on **L** and **K** will reveal:  
  - Whether **L** is in position 2 (✓ or x).  
  - Whether **K** is in position 5 (✓ or x).  
  - This will reduce possibilities to a very small set (e.g., if both are absent, only words like **SHUNS** or **SMUSH**—but **SMUSH** has U at position 5, conflicting with position 3).

Since we have no prior knowledge of the secret word, we need to make a guess that maximizes the information we can get for the next guess.\n A common strategy is to use a word that includes common letters and distinct letters to cover as many possibilities as possible.\n\n Let\'s consider the following: English letters that are frequent include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, N, L).\n We want to get feedback on as many common letters as possible.\n\n One of the popular starting words is ""SLATE"" because it has two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T). Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also a good one.\n\n However, note that we have 6 tries. Let me choose a word that includes a variety of letters.\n\n I choose: ""CRANE""\n\n Why?\n - It has two vowels: A, E\n - Three consonants: C, R, N (which are fairly common)\n - All distinct letters: so we can get clear feedback on each.\n\n Therefore, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".<thinking>\nFor the first guess in Wordle, it\'s strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain. I should pick a word with common letters to cover frequent vowels and consonants. An optimal first guess often includes vowels and common consonants to test multiple possibilities at once.\n\nAfter considering words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"" is a strong candidate because:\n- It contains two vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N) \n- All letters are distinct, avoiding redundant feedback  \n- C, R, A, N, E appear frequently in English words  \n- This combination provides broad coverage for positional feedback  \n\n""Crane"" lets me test:\n- Vowels: A in position 3, E in position 5  \n- Consonants: C (start), R (mid), N (end)  \n\nThe feedback will clarify:  \n- Which consonants exist in the secret word  \n- Vowel presence/position  \n- Several positional relationships  \n\nThis sets up an efficient second guess regardless of the outcome.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"": C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nThis means:\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4, since N is the 4th letter in CRANE: C=1, R=2, A=3, N=4, E=5).\n- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.\n\nSo the secret word has the letter N in the fourth position, and does not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nSince the word must be 5 letters and English, we can deduce:\n- The fourth letter is N.\n- The word does not contain any of the letters C, R, A, E.\n\nWe are making the second guess.\n\nStrategy:\n- We know the fourth letter is N, so we can fix that position to N in our next guess? But note: we are not forced to put N in the fourth position because we are trying to get more information? Actually, we can choose to fix it to confirm or to test other positions.\n\nHowever, note the feedback: N is in the correct position. So in the secret word, position 4 is N. Therefore, for our next guess, if we put N in the fourth position, we can get feedback on the other letters. If we don\'t, then we might get a \'-\' for N elsewhere, but that would be confusing because we know that N is already in position 4 and might not be duplicated? Let me check: the word might have duplicate letters? The rules don\'t say that the word has unique letters. So it\'s possible to have duplicate letters.\n\nBut note the feedback: for the first guess, we had one N in the fourth position and it was marked as ✓. And the other letters were absent. So it is possible that the secret word has another N? But the feedback doesn\'t show multiple marks for duplicates? Let me clarify the rules.\n\nThe example: Secret Word: BRISK, Guess: STORM -> S is in the word but wrong position? Wait, in the example: S is the first letter? Actually, in STORM: S, T, O, R, M. Feedback: S(-) meaning present but wrong position? But in BRISK, there is an S at position 4? So S in STORM is at position 1, but in BRISK it\'s at position 4, so S gets \'-\'.\n\nBut what if there are duplicates? For example, if the secret word is APPLE and we guess PAPER: then the first P would be \'-\' (present but wrong position) because there is a P in secret at position 2? Actually, for APPLE: letters are A, P, P, L, E. Guess PAPER: P in position 1, A in position 2, P in position 3, E in position 4, R in position 5.\n\nFeedback:\n- The secret has P at positions 2 and 3? So for the guess:\n  - Position 1: P -> present? but wrong position? Because secret has P at 2 and 3? Since secret has two P\'s, if guess has a P and it\'s not in the first position, but secret has P elsewhere? Actually, the rule: it marks for each occurrence. Typically, Wordle uses a rule that only marks a letter once if it appears once? Actually no, Wordle handles duplicates: if there is a duplicate in the secret, then both must be accounted for. \n\nBut I don\'t want to complicate. Since we have feedback that N is at position 4 and the others are absent, and no indication of duplicates, we can assume that there might be no other N? But we don\'t know. However, to be safe, let\'s avoid using N in other positions for now? Or we can try to test whether there is another N? But we have limited guesses. Probably not necessary at this point.\n\nGiven that we know:\n- Position 4 is N.\n- The word does not contain C, R, A, E.\n\nSo we need to choose a word that:\n- Has N in the fourth position? Actually, we don\'t have to, but it might be efficient because if we put N in fourth again and it shows ✓ again, we confirm. But we already know position 4 is N. So putting N in fourth will give us ✓ for that, and we can focus on testing other letters.\n\nSo I recommend a guess that has N in the fourth position, and uses other letters that are common and not in the set {C,R,A,E}. This way we get information about other positions.\n\nWhat letters are available? We have eliminated C,R,A,E. So we can use: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nCommon letters to test: S, T, L, O, P, etc.\n\nWe also know that vowels are important: the word must have vowels since it\'s English. The vowels excluding A and E: we have I, O, U (and sometimes Y). So we should include at least one vowel? But note: the secret word might have no A,E, but must have one of I,O,U,Y or else it wouldn\'t be a word.\n\nSo let\'s pick a word that:\n- Has N in the fourth position.\n- Uses other letters from the available set.\n- Includes at least one vowel (I,O,U, or Y).\n\nPopular words: but avoid letters we\'ve already eliminated.\n\nExample: TUNIC? TUNIC: T,U,N,I,C? But C is eliminated? We know C is absent, so TUNIC has C which is wasted? We shouldn\'t use C again because we know it\'s not in the word.\n\nBetter: words without C, R, A, E.\n\nIdea: words ending with N? So fourth position, then fifth letter. The word is ? ? ? N ? \n\nPossible words: \n- _ _ _ N S? But the fifth letter must be a letter we haven\'t tried? We know E is out? So let\'s avoid S at fifth? Actually, we can use S.\n\nFor the fourth position to be N, and we can try to get the fifth letter.\n\nExamples of words: \n- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> but T is an option? Also, it has I which is a vowel.\n- JOINT: J,O,I,N,T -> similar.\n- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> uses O and U? \n- DONUT: D,O,N,U,T -> wait, DONUT has N at position 3? No: D-O-N-U-T -> position: D(1),O(2),N(3),U(4),T(5) -> but we want N at position 4? So that doesn\'t fix.\n\nWe need a word where N is at position 4: so letter1, letter2, letter3, N, letter5.\n\nExamples:\n- SPOON? S,P,O,O,N -> but N is at position 5? Not 4.\n- PLAN? PLAN is 4 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n5-letter words with N at position 4? So pattern: ...N.\n\nFor example:\n- POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> N is the fourth letter? Positions: P1, O2, I3, N4, T5 -> yes.\n- JOINT: same\n- MOINT? Not a word? But JOINT is valid.\n- FAINT: F,A,I,N,T -> but A is eliminated? We cannot use A because we know A is not in the word? So avoid A.\n- Similarly, PRINT: P,R,I,N,T -> R is eliminated? So no R.\n- So we need a word without C,R,A,E and with N in the fourth position.\n\nPossible words:\n- POINT: letters P,O,I,N,T -> available? P, O, I, T are all new? O and I are vowels? Also T is common.\n- JOINT: J is less common? Probably not as good? But both are valid.\n\nOther words: \n- COUNT: C,O,U,N,T -> C is eliminated? We can\'t use C.\n- MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> M is okay? M, O, U, T? O and U are vowels -> valid word.\n- MOIST: M,O,I,S,T -> but N? We need N at position 4. MOIST has no N? Wrong.\n\nSo for ...N., examples: \n- POINT: uses P,O,I,T? But O and I are vowels? And P, T consonants? Yes.\n- Also, STINK: S,T,I,N,K -> N is fourth? Positions: S(1),T(2),I(3),N(4),K(5). But I is vowel? And S,T,K are consonants-> valid but has I? \nBut note: we haven\'t tested I, O, U, etc.\n\nWe could use POINT? But let me check: is there a better word?\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that doesn\'t necessarily fix the N? But if we don\'t fix the fourth position, then we can test other positions? But since we know the fourth letter is N, and we test N elsewhere? But we might get feedback that N is present elsewhere? Actually, we are not forced to put N at the fourth? However, putting N at fourth will confirm and we can focus on other letters.\n\nIn fact, given that we have fixed one position, it is efficient to build on that.\n\nSo I suggest POINT: uses new letters: P, O, I, T? And N at position 4.\n\nBut POINT has two vowels? O and I? That might be good for information.\n\nAnother option: JOINT? J is less common? So POINT is better? Or MOUNT? MOUNT: M,O,U,N,T -> vowels O and U? Also good? Both are valid.\n\nLet\'s choose MOUNT? Why? Because it uses U which is another vowel? Not tested yet? Whereas POINT uses O and I? We are testing more vowels? Actually, we have to cover vowels: we know A and E are absent, so the vowels must be among I, O, U? By testing MOUNT, we cover O and U? And in POINT we cover O and I? So both are good? MOUNT also tests M and T? Same as POINT? Except POINT tests I and P, and MOUNT tests U and M.\n\nSince M and P are both common? It\'s a toss-up. I\'ll go with POINT because ""point"" is a very common word? But MOUNT is also common? Actually, both are fine.\n\nAnother idea: SINEW? S,I,N,E,W -> but E is eliminated? We cannot use E? So not.\n\nAvoid using eliminated letters.\n\nSo POINT: P,O,I,N,T -> avoids C,R,A,E? And has O and I? And N fixed at fourth.\n\nBut wait: in POINT, the N is at position four? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to get the fifth letter? For example, words ending in ...NS? But we don\'t know if there is an S? We haven\'t tested S? Also, fifth letter could be anything? So testing the fifth letter is important.\n\nWith POINT, we test:\n- Position1: P\n- Position2: O\n- Position3: I\n- Position4: N (which we know, so we expect ✓ for N at 4? But it will be marked accordingly? Actually, if we put N at position 4 and it is indeed N, we get ✓. We can make that guess? It doesn\'t waste because we get information about positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nSame with MOUNT.\n\nLet me pick POINT? Or another word that avoids duplicate letters? POINT has distinct letters? Yes, all distinct? That is good for maximum information.\n\nBut note: MOUNT has distinct too: M,O,U,N,T? Also distinct? Both are distinct.\n\nI think POINT is slightly better because \'I\' is a very common vowel? And MOUNT has U which is less common? But that might be okay.\n\nBut let\'s see: POINT: P(common), O(common vowel), I(common vowel), N(fixed), T(common)? Also, the fifth letter T? It might be present.\n\nBut alternatively: STINT: S,T,I,N,T -> duplicate T? So not distinct? Avoid.\n\nWe want distinct letters to maximize information? Yes.\n\nBut POINT? Distinct: P,O,I,N,T -> yes.\n\nAnother candidate: JOINS? J,O,I,N,S -> not? JOINS: N is fourth? J(1),O(2),I(3),N(4),S(5)? Then we test J? J is low frequency? So POINT is better? P is better than J? Yes.\n\nSo we\'ll go with POINT.\n\nBut note: the secret word might not contain O or I? We don\'t know? So POINT might reveal.\n\nLet me write: guess POINT.\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- We know the fourth letter is N? So POINT has N at position 4? Yes.\n- We are testing P at position1, O at position2, I at position3, T at position5? Perfect.\n\nSo after guessing, we will get feedback: which of these are ✓, -, or x.\n\nThat will help narrow down.\n\nTherefore, my second guess: POINT.\n\nBut wait: are we allowed to use POINT? It is a valid English word? Yes.\n\nSo <guess>POINT</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  \n- C, R, A, and E are not in the secret word.  \n- N is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4).  \n\nFor the next guess, the strategy is to:  \n- Fix N in position 4 to confirm its location and gather information on other positions.  \n- Use letters not previously tested (avoid C, R, A, E) and prioritize common consonants and vowels (e.g., I, O, U).  \n- Select a word with all distinct letters to maximize new information gain.  \n\nThe word ""POINT"" fits well because:  \n- It places N in position 4, ensuring it will get a ✓ if correct.  \n- It tests new letters: P (position 1), O (vowel at position 2), I (vowel at position 3), and T (position 5).  \n- No duplicated letters mean feedback will be clearer for each position.  \n- ""POINT"" uses common letters, increasing the chance of hits and narrowing possibilities.  \n\nThis guess will help identify whether P, O, I, or T are in the word and their potential positions.\n\n<guess>POINT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1.

The word must be 5 letters, with the 4th letter being N, and none of the above letters.\n\nAvailable letters: We have to avoid C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T. So the available letters are:\nB, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe also need to consider that the word must have vowels. The vowels we haven\'t tried are U and sometimes Y (and rarely others, but mainly U and Y).

U ? N ? \n  - Examples: \n    - BUNCH → but C and H? B(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) → N is at 3, not 4. Wrong pattern.\n    - We need the N at 4, so the vowel should be in position 1,2,3, or 5? But position 3 is before N? \n\nActually, the vowel can be in any position. But we need the word to have the form ...N.\n\nLet me think of words ending with ""UN"" or similar? But that would be position 4 and 5? Not necessarily.\n\nBetter to think of words with N as the fourth letter.\n\nExamples:\n- BLANK: B,L,A,N,K → but A is eliminated? A is not allowed.\n- FLANK: F,L,A,N,K → A not allowed.\n- PLANK: P,L,A,N,K → P and A not allowed.\n- THANK: T,H,A,N,K → T and A not allowed.\n\nWe need to avoid A and T?

T is eliminated? Yes, from POINT feedback.\n\nWhat about words with U and without A or T?\n\n- BUNGS? B,U,N,G,S → but N is at position 3? B(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),S(5) → not pattern.\n\nWe need N at 4? So position 3 must be a letter, then N at 4.\n\n- How about: _ _ U N _ ? That is, U at position 3, then N at 4? So the word has U in the third position.\n\nExamples:\n- LUNGS: L,U,N,G,S → L(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),S(5) → N is at 3, not 4? Wrong.\n\nPattern: position 3 is U, position 4 is N?

S(1),Y(2),N(3),O(4),D(5) → not pattern.\n\nPattern: ...N. with N at 4.\n\n- STYNY? Not a word? \n- SHINY: S,H,I,N,Y → I is eliminated? I not allowed.\n\nWe need to use U or Y without the eliminated letters.\n\nAnother idea: the vowel might be in position 1 or 2 or 5.\n\nFor example, position 5 could be a vowel? Like U or Y.\n\nPattern: _ _ _ N U or _ _ _ N Y\n\nWords ending with NU? Not common? Or NY?\n\n- MANU? Not 5 letters.\n- MENU: M,E,N,U → E not allowed and 4 letters.\n\n5-letter words ending with NU? I can\'t think of any.\n\nEnding with NY:\n- FUNNY: F,U,N,N,Y → but N is at position 3 and 4? F(1),U(2),N(3),N(4),Y(5) → so position 4 is N? Yes! And it has two N\'s? But we know N is at position 4, and it might have another N? But we don\'t know? The feedback for CRANE only showed one N? But it could have more? The feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates? Actually, in CRANE, we had N at position 4 and it was marked ✓, but if there was another N, we wouldn\'t know? Because we didn\'t test it? But in POINT, we had N at position 4 and it was ✓, and no other N? But we didn\'t have N elsewhere? So it\'s possible that there is another N? But we don\'t know.\n\nSo FUNNY: \n- F(1), U(2), N(3), N(4), Y(5)\n- We know position 4 is N? So the second N (at position 4) is correct? But what about the first N at position 3? If the secret word has only one N, then position 3 would be marked as absent? But if it has two N\'s, then it might be marked as present but wrong position? Or if the secret has N at position 4, and we have N at position 3 and 4, then position 3 would be marked as \'-\' if there is another N? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we are allowed to use N again? But we know N is in the word? So we can use it? But in this case, for FUNNY, we are testing F, U, and Y? And also testing if there is another N? But we are not sure.\n\nBut we have to avoid eliminated letters? FUNNY: F, U, N, N, Y. U and Y are vowels? F and Y are new? But we have to check if U and Y are available? U is available? Y is available? And F is available? Yes.\n\nBut the problem: we are testing two N\'s? But we know one N is at position 4? So if we guess FUNNY, and the secret word has only one N (at position 4), then:\n- Position 1: F → if not in word, x\n- Position 2: U → if in word, might be marked\n- Position 3: N → but since there is only one N and it\'s at position 4, this would be marked x? Because the N is already used at position 4? Or marked as absent? Yes, typically, if there is only one N, and we have two in the guess, the first one might be marked absent if not in the word? But position 3: N is not in the word? So x? And position 4: N is correct? ✓? And position 5: Y? \n\nBut if the secret word has two N\'s, then position 3 N might be marked as \'-\' if there is an N elsewhere? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, we are trying to get information? So it might be messy? But we have to guess a word? And FUNNY is a valid word? But let\'s see if there are better options.\n\nAnother word: BUNNY? B,U,N,N,Y → same issue? And B is available? But again, two N\'s.\n\nWe need a word with distinct letters? But it\'s hard? Because we have to use available letters and have N at position 4.\n\nWhat about: SULUS? Not a word? \n\nAnother idea: use Y as a vowel in position 5.\n\nPattern: _ _ _ N Y\n\nWords:\n- SUNNY: S,U,N,N,Y → two N\'s? S(1),U(2),N(3),N(4),Y(5) → position 4 is N? Yes? But again, two N\'s? And U is at position 2? But we can test U and Y? And S? \n\nBut same duplicate issue? \n\n- GUNKY: G,U,N,K,Y → G(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → but N is at position 3? Not 4? We need N at position 4? So not.\n\n- JUMBY? Not a word? \n\n- LUNGY: L,U,N,G,Y → L(1),U(2),N(3),G(4),Y(5) → N at 3? Not 4.\n\nWe need to have the third letter be something else, then N at 4.\n\nHow about: BUG? Not 5 letters.\n\nLet\'s search for words with pattern: ??N? and N at position 4.\n\nAvailable letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nAnd must include a vowel: U or Y.\n\nPossible words:\n- DUNGY? Not a word? \n- FUNKY: F,U,N,K,Y → N at position 3? F(1),U(2),N(3),K(4),Y(5) → so position 4 is K? But we need position 4 to be N? So not.\n\nI think I\'m stuck with words that have N at position 4 and use U or Y.\n\nAnother word: MUMMY? M,U,M,M,Y → but N? No N? We need N at position 4? Not.\n\nPerhaps: BUNCH? But N at 3? Not.\n\nLet\'s think of: the word ""SWUNG"": S,W,U,N,G → S(1),W(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) → yes! N at position 4? And U at position 3? And S, W, G are available? And U is vowel? \n\nIs ""SWUNG"" a valid word? Yes, past participle of swing? Like ""the door was swung open"".\n\nLetters: S, W, U, N, G? All distinct? S, W, U, N, G? Yes, all distinct? And we haven\'t tested S, W, U, G? U is new? And we need to test vowels? U is a vowel.\n\nAlso, no eliminated letters? S, W, U, G are not in the eliminated set? Eliminated: C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T? So S, W, U, G are all allowed.\n\nPerfect! So we can guess ""SWUNG"".\n\nAnother option: ""FLUNG"": F,L,U,N,G → F(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) → also valid? But L is available? Yes? But we haven\'t tested L? So both are good? But SWUNG has S and W? Which are common? FLUNG has F and L? Also common? \n\nBut we can choose one? Let\'s go with SWUNG? Or FLUNG? \n\nAnother one: ""SLUNG"": S,L,U,N,G → similar? But L is available? \n\nBut to maximize new letters? We have 6 guesses? So it\'s okay? \n\nI think SWUNG is fine? Or perhaps we can choose a word that tests more common letters? S is more common than F? But both are okay.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have to avoid many letters? So SWUNG: S, W, U, N, G.\n\nWe can also consider ""STUNG"": but T is eliminated? From POINT, T is absent? So not allowed? STUNG has T? S,T,U,N,G → T is not allowed? So we cannot use T.\n\nSimilarly, ""SKUNK"": S,K,U,N,K → duplicate K? And K at position 2 and 5? But we need to test? But duplicate? And not distinct? But it\'s a word? But we can use? But we want distinct for more information? But not necessary? \n\nBut SKUNK: S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → position 4 is N? Yes? But K appears twice? If we guess, and the secret has K, it might be marked? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut to keep it simple, let\'s go with SWUNG? It has distinct letters? And common? \n\nAnother word: ""BULGY""? Not common? \n\nI think SWUNG is a good choice.\n\nSo third guess: SWUNG\n\nBut let\'s write it: S-W-U-N-G\n\nPositions: 1:S, 2:W, 3:U, 4:N, 5:G\n\nWe expect N at position 4 to be ✓? And we test S, W, U, G.\n\nIf any of them are in the word, we get feedback.\n\nSo <guess>SWUNG</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.  \n  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: POINT**  \n  Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - N is confirmed again at position 4 (no new information here).  \n  - P, O, I, T are **not** in the secret word.  \n\n### Key Insights\n1. **Fixed Position**: The 4th letter is **N**.  \n2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T (8 letters eliminated).  \n3. **Available Letters**: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  \n4. **Vowel Constraint**: Since A, E, I, O are eliminated, the secret word must contain **U** or **Y** (or both) as vowels.  \n5. **Pattern**: The secret word follows the pattern `_ _ _ N _`.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3\n- **Prioritize testing new vowels**: Focus on **U** and **Y** (since other vowels are eliminated).  \n- **Maximize information**: Use a word with distinct, common letters from the available set to test multiple positions.  \n- **Leverage the fixed position**: Keep **N** at position 4 to confirm its placement and focus on other positions.  \n- **Avoid eliminated letters**: Ensure no letters from {C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T} are used.  \n\n### Why ""SWUNG""?\n- **Word**: SWUNG  \n- **Breakdown**:  \n  - S (position 1): Common consonant, not tested yet.  \n  - W (position 2): Common consonant, not tested.  \n  - U (position 3): Untested vowel (critical for validation).  \n  - N (position 4): Fixed (expected ✓).  \n  - G (position 5): Common consonant, not tested.  \n- **Advantages**:  \n  - Tests 4 new letters (S, W, U, G), all distinct.  \n  - Includes **U** (vowel), addressing the vowel constraint.  \n  - Valid English word (past participle of ""swing"").  \n  - Efficiently probes positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 with high-frequency letters.  \n\nThis guess will clarify:  \n- If **S, W, U, or G** are in the secret word.  \n- Their positions (via feedback).  \n- Whether **U** is the missing vowel.\n\n<guess>SWUNG</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: SWUNG -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(x) U(✓) N(✓) G(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\n1.

P, O, I, T are absent.\n3. SWUNG: S(✓), W(x), U(✓), N(✓), G(x) → S is in the correct position (1st), U is in the word but in the wrong position (since it was guessed at position 3 but the feedback is U(✓) would mean correct position? Wait, let\'s check the feedback format.\n\nThe feedback for SWUNG: S(✓) W(x) U(✓) N(✓) G(x)\n\nBut note: the feedback symbols:\n- ✓ : correct letter in correct position.\n- - : letter in word but wrong position.\n- x : letter not in word.\n\nIn the feedback for SWUNG:\n- S(✓) means S is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 1).\n- W(x) means W is not in the word.\n- U(✓) means U is in the secret word and in the correct position? But we guessed U at position 3, so if U(✓), that means position 3 is U? \n- N(✓) means N is correct at position 4 (as we know).\n- G(x) means G is not in the word.\n\nBut wait, the feedback says U(✓) for position 3? That would mean the secret word has U at position 3? But we also have S at position 1 and N at position 4.\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- Position 1: S (from SWUNG feedback)\n- Position 3: U? (from U(✓) at position 3)\n- Position 4: N\n\nBut we don\'t know position 2 and 5? And we know that W and G are absent.\n\nAlso, from previous feedback, we know that C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T are absent.\n\nSo the secret word pattern: S _ U N _\n\nWe know the 2nd and 5th letters are missing.\n\nAlso, the 5th letter is unknown? And we know the word must be English and 5 letters.\n\nNow, what about the U? The feedback says U(✓) at position 3? So position 3 is U? Then the word is S _ U N _\n\nBut we also know that from the first guess, we had no U? But we didn\'t test U until now? So that\'s fine.\n\nBut let me confirm the feedback: in SWUNG, we have:\n- Position 1: S → ✓ (so secret has S at 1)\n- Position 2: W → x (absent)\n- Position 3: U → ✓ (so secret has U at 3)\n- Position 4: N → ✓ (as expected)\n- Position 5: G → x (absent)\n\nSo the secret word is: S, ?, U, N, ? \n\nWhere the second and fifth letters are unknown.\n\nNow, we know the absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, W, G. Also, from the first guess, we had N, but we know it\'s at position 4? And we have U and S now.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z? But we must use only these? And the word must be English.\n\nThe word pattern: S _ U N _\n\nPossible letters for position 2: any available consonant? But we need to form a word.\n\nAlso, position 5: any available letter? But the word must have a vowel? We have U at position 3, which is a vowel? So the word has a vowel? So the other letters can be consonants? But Y can sometimes be a vowel? But we have U, so it\'s okay.\n\nNow, what are possible words? S _ U N _\n\nCommon words:\n- STUN? But that\'s 4 letters? We need 5 letters? STUN is 4? S-T-U-N? So 4 letters? Not 5.\n\n5-letter words: \n- STUNG? But T is eliminated? From POINT, T is absent? So not.\n- SWUNG? But we guessed it? And it\'s not the secret? Because we got feedback that S and U and N are correct? But W and G are absent? So SWUNG is not the secret? Because we have two x\'s? So it\'s not all correct.\n\nSo we need a word like S?U N?\n\nPossibilities:\n- S H U N ? \n- S K U N ? \n- S L U N ? \n- S M U N ? \n- S B U N ? \n- etc.\n\nBut what words exist?\n\n- SHUNT: S,H,U,N,T → but T is eliminated? T is absent? So not.\n- SHUNS: S,H,U,N,S → but S is at the end? And we have S at position 1? But SHUNS: S(1),H(2),U(3),N(4),S(5) → so position 5 is S? But we already have S at position 1? And S might be duplicated? But we don\'t know if the secret has two S\'s? However, in SWUNG, we had S at position 1 and it was ✓, but we didn\'t have S elsewhere? So if the secret has two S\'s, we wouldn\'t know? But in SHUNS, we are testing S at position 5? But we know S is at position 1? So if we guess SHUNS, and the secret has only one S, then position 5 S would be x? Or if it has two S\'s, it might be - or ✓? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s see: SHUNS is a word? Yes, meaning to avoid or ignore? But T is not used? H is available? But position 5 is S? And we have to avoid eliminated letters? T is eliminated? But SHUNS doesn\'t have T? It has S,H,U,N,S.\n\nBut we have eliminated: C,R,A,E,P,O,I,T,W,G? So H is not eliminated? Yes, H is available.\n\nBut we have S at position 1 and 5? So if we guess SHUNS, we are testing H at position 2? And S at position 5? But we already know S is at position 1? So if the secret has only one S, then position 5 S would be x? If it has two, it might be - or ✓? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we can try? However, we have other options.\n\nAnother word: SKUNK? S,K,U,N,K → but K at position 2 and 5? And we have K available? But SKUNK: S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → but we know position 3 is U? So it matches? But we have K twice? And we don\'t know if K is in the word? But in SWUNG, we didn\'t test K? So it could be.\n\nBut SKUNK has K? And if we guess, we can see? But let\'s see if there are better words.\n\nAnother word: SLUNG? S,L,U,N,G → but G is eliminated? From SWUNG, G is absent? So not.\n\nSimilarly, FLUNG: F,L,U,N,G → G absent? And F and L available? But G is absent? So not.\n\nWhat about: SHULN? Not a word.\n\nOr: S M U N G? But G absent? Not.\n\nPerhaps: S B U N K? SBUNK? Not a word.\n\nS J U N K? SJUNK? Not a word.\n\nS M U N K? SMUNK? Not a word.\n\nS P U N K? But P is eliminated? Not.\n\nAnother idea: the fifth letter could be D? S D U N D? Not 5 letters? S,D,U,N,D? D at position 2 and 5? But S(1),D(2),U(3),N(4),D(5) → is that a word? ""Sdund"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps: SOUND? But O is eliminated? Not.\n\nWe need to find a word that fits S _ U N _ with available letters.\n\nList of possible words:\n- SHUNS: S,H,U,N,S → as above? But we have S at 1 and 5? And H at 2? H is available? And no eliminated letters? So it\'s possible? But is it a valid word? Yes, ""shuns"" is the third person singular of shun? Like ""he shuns"".\n\nBut we have to consider: in the feedback for SWUNG, we had U at position 3 correct? So in SHUNS, position 3 is U? So it matches? And position 4 is N? So the only new thing is position 2: H and position 5: S.\n\nBut we already know S is at position 1? So if the secret word has only one S, then position 5 S would be marked as absent? But if it has two S\'s, it might be present? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we can guess SHUNS? And see the feedback.\n\nAnother word: SKULK? S,K,U,L,K → but position 3 is U? S(1),K(2),U(3),L(4),K(5) → but position 4 is L? But we need position 4 to be N? So not? The pattern is fixed: position 4 is N? So we must have N at 4? So SKULK has L at 4? Not N? So not.\n\nSimilarly, SKIMP? But no U? And position 3 is I? I is eliminated? Not.\n\nWe need position 3 to be U? Because we have U(✓) at position 3? So the secret has U at position 3? So we must have U at position 3 in our guess? Or we can have it elsewhere? But the feedback says U is in the correct position? So position 3 is U? So we must keep U at position 3? Or we can change? But we know it\'s fixed? So for the next guess, we should keep U at position 3 and S at position 1 and N at position 4? Because they are correct.\n\nSo the guess must have:\n- Position 1: S\n- Position 3: U\n- Position 4: N\n- Position 2: some letter from available\n- Position 5: some letter from available\n\nAnd the available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z? And we avoid W, G (from SWUNG feedback), and the previously eliminated.\n\nSo for position 2 and 5, we can use: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, what words exist with pattern: S (letter) U N (letter)\n\nExamples:\n- SHUNS: S, H, U, N, S → H at 2, S at 5? But S is already at 1? So if the secret has two S\'s, it might be okay? But we don\'t know? But let\'s list possible.\n\n- SHUNK? Not a word? \n- SHUNT: but T eliminated? Not.\n- SPUNK: P eliminated? Not.\n- SLUNG: G eliminated? Not.\n- STUNG: T eliminated? Not.\n- SWUNG: we already guessed? And it\'s not the secret? Because we had W and G absent? And we have S and U correct? But not all.\n\nSo what about: \n- S K U N K → SKUNK? Is that a word? Yes, meaning a type of animal? Or to avoid? S(1),K(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → so K at 2 and 5? And K is available? So we can try SKUNK.\n\n- Or S M U N G? But G eliminated? Not.\n- S B U N K? SBUNK? Not a word.\n- S D U N K? SDUNK? Not a word.\n- S F U N K? SFUNK? Not a word? But ""funk"" is a word, but S FUNK? Not a word? \n- S H U N K? SHUNK? Not a word? But ""shrink"" has R? R eliminated? Not.\n- S J U N K? SJUNK? Not a word.\n- S L U N K? SLUNK? Yes, past tense of slink? S(1),L(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → but position 5 is K? And L at 2? And K at 5? But we have no duplicate? And L and K available? \n\nSLUNK: S,L,U,N,K → valid word? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, SKUNK: S,K,U,N,K → valid? Yes.\n\nNow, which one to choose? Both are valid? But SKUNK has duplicate K? So if we guess SKUNK, and the secret has only one K, then one of the K\'s might be marked? But we can still get information.\n\nBut to maximize information, we might prefer distinct letters? But in this case, for position 2 and 5, we have to choose two letters? And we have limited choices.\n\nAnother word: S M U N K? SMUNK? Not a word? \n- Or S V U N G? Not.\n- S Y U N K? SYUNK? Not a word.\n\nSo possible words: SHUNS, SKUNK, SLUNK? \n\nSHUNS: S,H,U,N,S → H at 2, S at 5? But S is duplicate? And we don\'t know if secret has two S\'s? But in SWUNG, we had only one S? And it was at position 1? So if the secret has only one S, then position 5 S in SHUNS would be x? And if it has two, it might be - or ✓? But since position 1 is S, if position 5 is also S, it would be ✓ if correct? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s consider the feedback we would get.\n\nPerhaps SLUNK is better? Because it has distinct letters: S,L,U,N,K? All distinct? And we test L and K? Both new.\n\nSimilarly, SKUNK has K at 2 and 5? So if we guess SKUNK, and the secret has K, then we might get feedback on K? But if it has only one K, then one position might be x? But we don\'t know which one? But it could be messy? But we can handle.\n\nBut for clarity, SLUNK might be better? Because distinct letters.\n\nAnother word: S M U N S? SMUNS? Not a word.\n\nOr S B U N S? SBUNS? Not.\n\nSo the only common words are SHUNS, SKUNK, SLUNK.\n\nBut SHUNS has duplicate S? And we already know S at position 1? So it might not be efficient? Because we are testing S again? But we need to test position 2 and 5.\n\nBut let\'s choose SLUNK: S, L, U, N, K.\n\nThen we test L at position 2 and K at position 5? Both new letters.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nSimilarly, with SKUNK, we test K at position 2 and 5? But if K is in the word, we don\'t know which position? But we can see the feedback.\n\nBut I think SLUNK is better because distinct.\n\nSo let\'s go with SLUNK.\n\nBut is there a word with Y? For example, S Y U N something? But S Y U N ? Not common? SYLPH? But no U? And position 3 is not U? We need U at position 3.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, I think SLUNK is a good guess.\n\nSo fourth guess: SLUNK\n\nBut let\'s write: S-L-U-N-K\n\nPositions: 1:S, 2:L, 3:U, 4:N, 5:K\n\nWe expect S, U, N to be correct? And we test L and K.\n\nSo <guess>SLUNK</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n- **Guess 1: CRANE**  \n  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - N is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 4.  \n  - C, R, A, E are **not** in the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: POINT**  \n  Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - N is confirmed at position 4.  \n  - P, O, I, T are **not** in the secret word.  \n\n- **Guess 3: SWUNG**  \n  Feedback: S(✓), W(x), U(✓), N(✓), G(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - S is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 1.  \n  - U is in the secret word and correctly placed at position 3.  \n  - N is confirmed at position 4.  \n  - W and G are **not** in the secret word.  \n\n### Key Insights\n1. **Fixed Positions**:  \n   - Position 1: **S**  \n   - Position 3: **U**  \n   - Position 4: **N**  \n   - The secret word pattern is: **S _ U N _** (only positions 2 and 5 are unknown).  \n2. **Absent Letters**: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, W, G (10 letters eliminated).  \n3. **Available Letters for Positions 2 and 5**: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.  \n4. **Constraints**:  \n   - The word must be a valid English 5-letter word.  \n   - Position 2 must be a consonant (since U at position 3 is the only vowel so far, and English words require vowels—Y could be a vowel but is less likely here).  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 4\n- **Focus on Positions 2 and 5**: Test high-frequency consonants from the available letters to maximize information.  \n- **Prioritize Distinct Letters**: Avoid duplicates to clarify feedback for each position.  \n- **Leverage Word Patterns**: The secret word must match the pattern `S _ U N _`. Common English words fitting this include **SLUNK** (past tense of ""slink""), **SHUNS** (third person of ""shun""), or **SKUNK** (an animal).  \n- **Opt for SLUNK**:  \n  - Tests **L** (position 2) and **K** (position 5), both common consonants not yet tried.  \n  - All letters are distinct, ensuring clear feedback.  \n  - Validates if **L** or **K** are in the word and their positions.  \n\n### Expected Outcomes\n- If **SLUNK** is correct, the game ends.  \n- If not, feedback on **L** and **K** will reveal:  \n  - Whether **L** is in position 2 (✓ or x).  \n  - Whether **K** is in position 5 (✓ or x).  \n  - This will reduce possibilities to a very small set (e.g., if both are absent, only words like **SHUNS** or **SMUSH**—but **SMUSH** has U at position 5, conflicting with position 3).\n\n<guess>SLUNK</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: POINT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(x) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: SWUNG -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) W(x) U(✓) N(✓) G(x)\nGuess 4: SLUNK -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) L(x) U(✓) N(✓) K(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → N is in the word and in the correct position (4th). C, R, A, E are absent.
2. POINT: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x) → N is correct at 4th. P, O, I, T are absent.
3. SWUNG: S(✓), W(x), U(✓), N(✓), G(x) → S is correct at 1st, U is correct at 3rd, N is correct at 4th. W and G are absent.
4. SLUNK: S(✓), L(x), U(✓), N(✓), K(✓) → S, U, N, K are all correct and in the correct positions? L is absent.

Feedback for SLUNK: S(✓) L(x) U(✓) N(✓) K(✓)

This means:
- S at position 1: correct and in position → so secret has S at 1.
- L at position 2: absent → so L is not in the word.
- U at position 3: correct and in position → secret has U at 3.
- N at position 4: correct and in position → secret has N at 4.
- K at position 5: correct and in position → secret has K at 5.

Therefore, the secret word must be: S _ U N K, with the second letter being the only unknown.

We know the secret word is S ? U N K.

We also know the absent letters: from previous feedback, we have C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, W, G, L (from SLUNK feedback).

So absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, W, G, L.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form S ? U N K, where the second letter is one of the available letters.

Possible words:
- SKUNK: but we have S at 1, and K at 5? But in SKUNK, it would be S(1), K(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) → but we have K at 2 and 5? But in the feedback for SLUNK, we have K(✓) at position 5, but we don't know about position 2? However, in SKUNK, if we had guessed it, position 2 would be K? But we haven't guessed it? But the secret word has K at position 5? And we don't know if it has K elsewhere? But in this case, for the secret word, we know position 5 is K? And position 1 is S, 3 is U, 4 is N? So the second letter is missing.

But SKUNK has K at position 2? But we don't know if that's the case? But we are to find the secret word.

Possible words: 
- SHUNK? Not a common word? But ""shunk"" is an archaic word? Or variant of shrink? But let's check: S,H,U,N,K → H is available? So SHUNK: S(1),H(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → valid? It might be accepted? But is it a valid Wordle word? Wordle uses common words? But we can try.

- Or STUNK: but T is eliminated? Not.

- Or SMUNK? Not a word.

- Or SPUNK: P eliminated? Not.

- Or SWUNK? Not a word.

- Or SDUNK? Not.

- Or SFUNK? Not.

- Or SBUNK? Not.

- Or SJUNK? Not.

- Or SVUNK? Not.

- Or SZUNK? Not.

- Or SYUNK? Not.

So SHUNK might be the only possibility? But is ""shunk"" a word? It is the past tense of ""shrink"" in some dialects? But typically, ""shrunk"" is used? But ""shunk"" is listed in some dictionaries as nonstandard? But Wordle might not have it.

Another possibility: SKUNK? But in SKUNK, the second letter is K? And we have K at position 5? But if the secret word is SKUNK, then it has K at position 2 and 5? But in the feedback for SLUNK, we had K(✓) at position 5? But we didn't have K at position 2? So if we had guessed SKUNK, we would have K at position 2 and 5? But we didn't guess that? But the secret could be SKUNK? Because we haven't tested K at position 2? But we know from SLUNK that K is at position 5? And if the secret has K at position 2, we wouldn't know? But in SLUNK, we only tested K at position 5? So it could be that the secret has K at position 2 as well? But we don't know.

But in the pattern, we have S ? U N K? So for SKUNK, it would be S, K, U, N, K? So the second letter is K? And fifth is K? So it fits the pattern? And K is not eliminated? So it's possible.

Similarly, SHUNK: S, H, U, N, K.

Now, which one is more likely? Or are there others?

Another word: ""stunk"" is common, but T is eliminated? Not.

""slunk"" we guessed? But we had L absent? So not.

""swunk"" not a word.

So the only common word that fits is SKUNK? Because SHUNK is not standard.

But let's confirm: SKUNK: S, K, U, N, K → positions: 1:S, 2:K, 3:U, 4:N, 5:K → so it matches the pattern? And the second letter is K? And fifth is K? And we have U at 3, N at 4? And S at 1? All match.

And the absent letters: we have eliminated L, but K is not eliminated? So it could be.

But in the feedback for SLUNK, we had K(✓) at position 5? That doesn't conflict? And for position 2, we haven't tested? So it could be K.

Moreover, in the available letters, K is available? So SKUNK is a valid guess.

But we have to make a guess? And we have two possibilities? SHUNK and SKUNK? But SHUNK might not be accepted? So let's go with SKUNK.

But note: we have only one guess left? We have made 4 guesses? We have 6 tries? So we can guess SKUNK? And if it's not, we have one more.

But let's see: if we guess SKUNK, and the secret is SKUNK, we win? If not, we get feedback.

But the pattern is fixed: only position 2 is unknown? And we have to choose a letter from available.

But we can list all possible:

Available letters for position 2: B, D, F, H, J, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, what words exist? 
- S B U N K? SBUNK? Not a word.
- S D U N K? SDUNK? Not.
- S F U N K? SFUNK? Not.
- S H U N K? SHUNK? Might be a word? But let's assume it is for now? Or not?
- S J U N K? SJUNK? Not.
- S M U N K? SMUNK? Not.
- S Q U N K? Not.
- S V U N K? Not.
- S X U N K? Not.
- S Y U N K? Not.
- S Z U N K? Not.

So only SHUNK and SKUNK? But SKUNK has K at position 2? And K is not in the available list? Because we didn't eliminate K? K is not in the absent list? So K is available? So for position 2, K is possible.

Similarly, H is available? So SHUNK is possible? But is it a valid word?

Upon checking, ""shunk"" is an archaic or dialectal past tense of ""shrink"", but in standard English, it's ""shrunk"". Wordle might not include it? But we don't know.

""skunk"" is a common word.

Moreover, in the feedback for SLUNK, we had K(✓) at position 5? But if the secret is SKUNK, then position 2 is also K? But we didn't test position 2? So it could be.

But when we guess SKUNK, we can see.

Since we have to guess, and SKUNK is a common word, I think that's the secret.

So let's guess SKUNK.

But note: we have only 6 tries? We are on the fifth guess? We have made 4, so this is the fifth.

If we are wrong, we have one more.

But I think SKUNK is likely.

Another thought: in the first guess, we had N at position 4? And in SKUNK, it has N at position 4? And U at 3? S at 1? K at 5? And K at 2? So it fits.

And the absent letters don't include K? So it's possible.

Therefore, I'll guess SKUNK.

So <guess>SKUNK</guess>

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: N is correct and in position 4. C, R, A, E are absent.
   - **Guess 2 (POINT)**: N is confirmed at position 4. P, O, I, T are absent.
   - **Guess 3 (SWUNG)**: S is correct at position 1, U is correct at position 3, N is confirmed at position 4. W and G are absent.
   - **Guess 4 (SLUNK)**: S, U, N, and K are all correct and in their positions (1, 3, 4, and 5). L is absent.
   
2. **Deduce the Secret Word Pattern**:
   - Position 1: **S** (fixed from Guess 3 and 4).
   - Position 2: Unknown (only missing letter).
   - Position 3: **U** (fixed from Guess 3 and 4).
   - Position 4: **N** (fixed from all guesses).
   - Position 5: **K** (fixed from Guess 4).
   - The secret word is **S _ U N K**, with only the second letter missing.

3. **Absent Letters**:
   - Eliminated so far: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, W, G, L (from feedback).
   - Available letters for position 2: B, D, F, H, J, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

4. **Identify Possible Words**:
   - The secret word must be a valid English 5-letter word matching `S _ U N K`.
   - Common words fitting this pattern:
     - **SKUNK**: Second letter is K (K is not eliminated and available).
     - **SHUNK**: Second letter is H (H is available, but ""shunk"" is nonstandard/archaic; less likely in Wordle).
     - Other combinations like SBUNK, SDUNK, etc., are invalid words.
   - **SKUNK** is the most common and valid word (e.g., an animal or verb meaning to defeat decisively). It fits the pattern and uses available letters.

5. **Final Decision**:
   - With only one letter unknown (position 2), **SKUNK** is the strongest guess. It tests K in position 2 (which is plausible and untested) and could solve the game.
   - If incorrect, feedback on position 2 will reduce options to near zero for the final guess (e.g., if K is wrong, only rare words like SHUNK might remain).

<guess>SKUNK</guess>",SKUNK,"We have feedback from four guesses:

1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x) → N is in the word and in the correct position (4th). C, R, A, E are absent.
2. POINT: P(x), O(x), I(x), N(✓), T(x) → N is correct at 4th. P, O, I, T are absent.
3. SWUNG: S(✓), W(x), U(✓), N(✓), G(x) → S is correct at 1st, U is correct at 3rd, N is correct at 4th. W and G are absent.
4. SLUNK: S(✓), L(x), U(✓), N(✓), K(✓) → S, U, N, K are all correct and in the correct positions? L is absent.

Feedback for SLUNK: S(✓) L(x) U(✓) N(✓) K(✓)

This means:
- S at position 1: correct and in position → so secret has S at 1.
- L at position 2: absent → so L is not in the word.
- U at position 3: correct and in position → secret has U at 3.
- N at position 4: correct and in position → secret has N at 4.
- K at position 5: correct and in position → secret has K at 5.

Therefore, the secret word must be: S _ U N K, with the second letter being the only unknown.

We know the secret word is S ? U N K.

We also know the absent letters: from previous feedback, we have C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, W, G, L (from SLUNK feedback).

So absent letters: C, R, A, E, P, O, I, T, W, G, L.

But the secret word has K at position 5? And we don't know if it has K elsewhere? But in this case, for the secret word, we know position 5 is K? And position 1 is S, 3 is U, 4 is N? So the second letter is missing.

But SKUNK has K at position 2? But we don't know if that's the case? But we are to find the secret word.

Possible words: 
- SHUNK? Not a common word? But ""shunk"" is an archaic word? Or variant of shrink? But let's check: S,H,U,N,K → H is available? So SHUNK: S(1),H(2),U(3),N(4),K(5) → valid? It might be accepted? But is it a valid Wordle word? Wordle uses common words? But we can try.
