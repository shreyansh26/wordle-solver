We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in word games often include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x -> not in the word
  R: ✓ -> correct position (so the second letter is R)
  A: ✓ -> correct position (so the third letter is A)
  N: ✓ -> correct position (so the fourth letter is N)
  E: x -> not in the word

Therefore, we know the word has the form: _ R A N _

We know the first letter is not C, and the last letter is not E. Also, the letters C and E are not in the word at all.

Now, we need to make a second guess that fits the pattern _ R A N _ and uses only letters that are possible.

The word must be of the form: [first letter] R A N [last letter]

We should avoid using C and E because they are not in the word.

Common first letters for 5-letter words with this pattern? Some options: 
  Let's consider possible words: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, etc.

But note: we have no information about other letters yet, except that C and E are absent.

Possible words:
  BRAND: B R A N D
  GRAND: G R A N D
  FRANK: F R A N K
  PRANK: P R A N K
  DRANK: D R A N K
  TRANK: not common, but exists? Not in common word list.

We also know that the word does not have C and E.

We want to test likely letters and also get information about the first and last positions.

Since we have three correct letters already, if we can guess a word that includes common letters for the missing positions, we might solve it or get closer.

We can try ""brand"" to test B and D? But note that in our first guess, we didn't have B or D, so we don't know if they are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more letters. However, we have two unknown letters: first and last.

We can choose a word that uses many new letters to maximize information.

Possible words that fit _ R A N _ and don't contain E or C:

List of possibilities (from common words):
  BRAND: B R A N D
  GRAND: G R A N D
  FRANK: F R A N K
  PRANK: P R A N K
  DRANK: D R A N K
  WRANG: uncommon
  KRANG: uncommon

Also: TREND? But E is not allowed -> TREND has E. We know E is not in the word.

Other possibilities: 
  CRANE had C and E not present, so avoid.

We can also consider: 
  BRAWN: B R A W N -> but position 5 is W? Wait, pattern requires fifth letter unknown, but fourth is N, fifth must be the last letter.

Word: _ R A N _

BRAWN: B R A W N -> but the fourth letter would be W? No: 
Positions: 1: B, 2: R, 3: A, 4: W, 5: N -> doesn't match because third letter must be A and fourth N? 
Wait, no: the pattern is fixed: 
Position 1: unknown, Position 2: R, Position 3: A, Position 4: N, Position 5: unknown.

BRAWN has the letters: B, R, A, W, N -> so positions: 
1: B, 2: R, 3: A, 4: W -> but we need position 4 to be N? 
So BRAWN does not fit because the fourth letter must be N? 
Actually, in a 5-letter word, BRAWN: 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: W -> but we know position 4 must be N -> so W is not N. So BRAWN does not fit pattern.

Similarly, no: any word must have R in position 2, A in position 3, N in position 4.

So valid words:

BRAND: positions: 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=D -> fits pattern.
GRAND: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=D -> fits?
But wait, same fifth letter? Both BRAND and GRAND end with D? Actually, no: BRAND -> B R A N D, GRAND -> G R A N D -> both have D? 
Yes, but then we don't know if fifth is D.

FRANK: 1=F, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=K -> fits.
PRANK: 1=P, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=K -> fits.
DRANK: 1=D, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=K -> fits.

Also: URAN, but URAN is not 5 letters. Must be 5.

Others: WRANK? Not common. 
IRANI? But positions: I R A N I -> fifth letter I? That's a word? 
But it has two I's? We don't know about I. But position 2 is R? Yes: 
1: I, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: I -> word ""IRANI"" exists? As in relating to Iran? It's a proper adjective? Not universally accepted in word games? 
Usually we stick to common nouns.

We should aim for a word that tests multiple possibilities.

Given the pattern, let's list possible first letters: B, F, G, D, P, etc. and last letters: D, K.

We know from feedback that the fifth letter is not E? And not among the ones missing?

We need a second guess. We can try ""FRANK"" to test F and K? Or ""PRANK"" for P and K? 

But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are not present: C and E.

Another idea: use a word that has different vowels in the other positions? Not needed because positions 2,3,4 are fixed.

We can also try to confirm if the word is BRAND or GRAND by guessing a word that includes B and D? But we already know R, A, N are fixed.

Alternatively, we can pick a word that covers several common consonants.

Since the word has R, A, N, and we need to find first and last letters.

We can try ""brand"" as the guess? But if we guess BRAND, then:
- If it is correct, we win.
- If not, we get feedback.

But what if the word is FRANK? Then BRAND would have:
  B: not in word -> x? Because we know BRAND would have B in position 1, which for FRANK is not present? 
  Similarly, D would be in position 5? For FRANK, position 5 is K, so D is not present? 
  So we would get: B(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), D(x). Then we know the first letter is not B and last not D, so it must be F or P or something and last letter K.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't reuse letters? But the pattern forces R, A, N. So the second, third, fourth letters are fixed? 
We must keep R, A, N in positions 2,3,4? 
But we cannot change that. So our guess must have R in second position, A in third, N in fourth.

We can only vary the first and fifth.

So the guess must be of the form: [new_letter1] R A N [new_letter2]

We haven't used many letters, so we can try to test two new letters.

We need to choose new letters that are common.

Possible guesses:
  If we pick FRANK: uses F and K? Both new? We haven't had F or K.
  Or PRANK: P and K.

But note, we also haven't had B, D, G, etc.

So choosing FRANK or PRANK only tests one possibility? 

But the goal is to get the word? If we guess FRANK and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on F and K.

Similarly, if we guess BRAND and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on B and D.

But there are multiple possibilities: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, PRANK, DRANK, etc.

We can try to guess a word that has a letter which might be in the word but in a different position? 
But the known pattern is fixed: the only letters we don't know are the first and the last? 

Wait, but also: are there other letters that might be in the word? The words we listed are the common ones? 
Actually, there might be more: 
  URAN? Not 5 letters.
  TRAIN: but not matching pattern? TRAIN -> T R A I N -> positions: 1=T, 2=R, 3=A, 4=I -> but we require position 4=N? So not train.
  BRAIN: B R A I N -> position 4=I -> but we require N? So no.
  CRAN? not 5 letters.

Actually, we require position 4 to be N, so only the words with ...RAN.. with N as fourth? 

Common ones: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, PRANK, DRANK. 
Less common: TRANK? (barely used)
Also: ARANK? Not in common use.

So likely words: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, PRANK, DRANK.

Now, we have a limited set.

How many guesses do we have? This is the second guess.

We can design a guess that tests multiple these? 

We can't because the pattern forces the same R, A, N in fixed positions? 

And the words have different first and last letters? 

But note: some share the last letter? So:
  BRAND: last D?
  GRAND: last D?
  FRANK: last K?
  PRANK: last K?
  DRANK: last K?

Also, first letters: 
  BRAND: B
  GRAND: G
  FRANK: F
  PRANK: P
  DRANK: D

So we can group by last letter:
  Last D: BRAND, GRAND
  Last K: FRANK, PRANK, DRANK

We can test which group? For the fifth letter? 

But we have to fix the first letter? 

We can guess a word that does not repeat the last letter? 

For example, guess ""FRAND""? Not a word? 
We must guess a valid word. 

Given the constraints, perhaps we guess ""brand"" to test if it is D-ending? But ""brand"" has specific first letter B.

Alternatively, we might guess a word that uses F and D? But that is not a valid word? 
Possible word? FRAND -> not word? 

How about ""GRAND""? It uses G and D? 

But both G R A N D? 

We can guess ""GRAND"" to test G and D? Then:
  If it is correct, we win.
  If not, then the last letter is not D? So it must be K-endings? 

Similarly, if we guess ""FRANK"" and it is correct, we win. If not, then it might be F? 
Actually, if we guess FRANK and it's wrong, we get feedback: for F, R, A, N, K. 
We know R, A, N are correct so will show ✓ for 2,3,4? 
Then F: ??? - if F is not the first letter, then if the word is BRAND, F is not in the word? So x. Similarly, K: if last is D? then K is not present? So x. 

But we don't know the first letter? How about if FRANK is wrong? Then we see:
Position 1: F -> if not correct and not in word: x? 
Position 2: R -> ✓ 
Position 3: A -> ✓ 
Position 4: N -> ✓ 
Position 5: K -> if not correct and not in word: x? 

So we get [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, x] meaning the word has R, A, N in positions 2,3,4 and the first letter is not F and fifth is not K? But then we know it's BRAND or GRAND? 

Alternatively, if we guess BRAND and it's not correct, we get:
Position 1: B -> x? meaning B not in word? Or just not in position? 
But wait: if the word is GRAND, then B would be not present? So x? 
Position 5: D -> if word is FRANK, then D is not present? So x? 
But for GRAND: 
  If we guess BRAND and the word is GRAND, then:
  B: not in the word -> x? 
  R: ✓ 
  A: ✓ 
  N: ✓ 
  D: for GRAND, D is present? At fifth position? So if we guess BRAND, position 5 is D, same as GRAND? So D would be ✓? 
Wait, no: position 5 is D? And the word is GRAND? Which has D in position 5? So it should be ✓? 

So if the word is GRAND and we guess BRAND:
  Position 1: B -> not in GRAND? So x.
  Position 2: R -> ✓ 
  Position 3: A -> ✓ 
  Position 4: N -> ✓ 
  Position 5: D -> but GRAND has D? And we guessed D? In the same position? So ✓? 

Wait: GRAND: G R A N D -> so position 5 is D? 
If we guess BRAND: B R A N D? 
For the word GRAND, our guess B R A N D: 
  B: not in GRAND? So x? 
  R: ✓ 
  A: ✓ 
  N: ✓ 
  D: in GRAND and in position 5? So ✓? 

So feedback: [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓] -> then we know the word is ?RA N D? So we know only first letter is wrong? 

But what about GRAND? Then first letter must be G? 

Similarly, if it was BRAND? We guess BRAND? Then all ✓. 

But also, if we guess FRANK? And the word is GRAND? Then:
  F: not in word? x
  R: ✓ 
  A: ✓ 
  N: ✓ 
  K: not in word? x? 
Then we see only positions 2,3,4 correct? So form: _ R A N _ and we know F and K are absent? So then we know to look for D-ending? 

So guessing FRANK? Then if we get all except positions 1 and 5 as correct (x, ✓, ✓, ✓, x), we know:
  The first letter is not F? And last not K? Then we need a word with last D? And R A N fixed. 

But we don't know which first letter? Then we can try BRAND next? Then GRAND? 

But we have limited guesses? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""PRAND"" - but not a word? 

So perhaps we should guess one that covers letters that might appear? 

Since we have to vary first and last? 

But note: there are only two groups? 

I think the efficient way is to guess a word that covers one possibility? 

But let's look at commonality: BRAND and GRAND are common? FRANK, PRANK, DRANK are less common? 

Perhaps we can try ""grand"" to test the D-ending? 

But also, if we guess GRAND? 
  If correct? win
  If not? Then we get feedback: 
    If it's BRAND: [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓] -> we know first letter is not G, but last letter is D? So next guess: first letter must not be G? and we guess B? 
    Then if BRAND? 
    So we win in 3rd guess.

  If the word is FRANK? Then if we guess GRAND: 
    G: not in FRANK? x
    R: ✓ 
    A: ✓ 
    N: ✓ 
    D: not in FRANK? (because FRANK has F, R, A, N, K) -> x? 
? How about FRANK: the word has R at pos2, A at pos3, N at pos4? 
Our guess GRAND has G (x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), D(x). 
Then we know: word is _ R A N _ and G and D are not present? 
Then next guess: FRANK? But wait, FRANK has F? And F is not excluded? 
Then we guess FRANK? Then if correct? Win? Or if not, then PRANK or DRANK? 

But we have DRANK: D? But we just found D is not in the word? Because in GRAND we guessed D and it was x? So not present? 
So only FRANK or PRANK? 
Then we guess FRANK? If x for F? Then we guess PRANK? 

But that might take more guesses? 

Alternatively, if we guess ""frank"" first? Then:
  If correct: win
  If not? Then we get feedback: 
    For the word BRAND: 
      F: not in word? x
      R: ✓ 
      A: ✓ 
      N: ✓ 
      K: not in word? x? Then we know D-ending? 
    Then we guess BRAND? Then if win? Else? 
    If BRAND is x for B? Then we know first letter must be G? 
    Then next? 
    Guess count: 2 frank, 3 brand, 4 grand? Worst-case 4? 
  Similarly, for GRAND: also last D? So we'd see [x,✓,✓,✓,x]? Same as above? 
  Then we guess BRAND? Then if not, then GRAND? 

But worst-case 3 guesses? If we guess FRANK and it's wrong, then we know it's either BRAND or GRAND? Then guess BRAND? If wrong? Then GRAND? 

That's two more guesses? Total 3? 

But we have 6 tries? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't fix the last letter? But how? 
We have to use the pattern? 

Wait, is there a possibility that the word has duplicate letters? For example, are there words like ""URANUS""? But not 5 letters? Or random? 

So far, the word seems to be one of the ones we listed. 

We can also test a letter that appears in multiple possibilities? 
For example, what letter do we want to test? We know about R, A, N? 

But let me think: we have two positions: first and fifth? 
Common letters? 
First: B, G, F, P, D? 
Fifth: D or K? 

We can try a word that uses, say, B and K? ""blank"" -> B L A N K -> but pattern requires R at position2? 
We cannot? Because we must have R at position2? 

Unless we use R in a different position? But we know R is at position2? 
But what if our previous feedback about R being ✓ is correct? So R is fixed at position2.

Therefore, we must have R in second? 

Thus, we have to guess a word of the form: ? R A N ?

Therefore, we must choose one of the possibilities? 

I think we should pick one? 

Let's go with FRANK? 
Because it covers one of the K-ending group? 
And FRANK is a common word? 

Alternatively, BRAND is also common? 

But note: we are learning more letters? 

If we guess FRANK? We test F and K? 

Then, regardless, we get information? 

So I'll go with FRANK? 

Guess: FRANK

Positions: F R A N K

If the word is BRAND? Then feedback: F(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(x)? 
Then we know the last letter is not K? And it must end with D? 
Then we'll try BRAND next? 

If the word is GRAND? Then FRANK: F(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(x)? 
Then we know to try GRAND? 

If the word is PRANK? Then FRANK: F(x) but P is not tested? Wait, not? 
If word is PRANK? Then FRANK guess? 
Position 1: F vs P? F not present? x? 
Position 5: K vs K? ✓? 
So [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? 
Then we know the word? is ?RANK? Then we guess PRANK? 
Because we know F is not? And we haven't tried P? 

Similarly for DRANK? Then FRANK guess would be [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? So ?RANK? Then we guess DRANK? 

So worst-case: 
  If the word is PRANK? 
  Guess1: crane -> feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
  Guess2: FRANK -> feedback: F(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(✓) -> only the first letter is wrong? 
  Then we know the word ends with K? And starts with something else? 
  Then we can guess DRANK? or PRANK? 
  How to tell? We don't know the first letter? But we haven't tried P? 
  So we guess PRANK? Then if correct? Win? 
  If incorrect? Then DRANK? 

But if the word is DRANK? Then when we guess FRANK? 
Position 1: F vs D? F is not present? x? 
Position 5: K? same? ✓? 
So we see [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? 
Then we know the first letter is not F? But the fifth is K? 
Then we try PRANK? But PRANK? 
If the word is DRANK? PRANK has P? Which is not in DRANK? So:
Position 1: P? x? 
Position 5: K? ✓? 
So again [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? 
Then we know it must be DRANK? Because we tried FRANK, PRANK? So next? DRANK? 

So worst-case? We might use 4 guesses? 

But we have 6? 

We could also choose a word that has one letter common? 

Alternatively, guess ""PRANK"" instead? Similar? 

But any word we choose? 

We can choose a word that doesn't duplicate? For example, guess ""GRAND""? 
Then:
  If win? done.
  If not? Then if the word is BRAND? we get [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? meaning first letter must be B? 
  Then next guess BRAND? 
  If the word is FRANK? then [x,✓,✓,✓,x]? meaning not D-ending? So next? FRANK? 
    Then FRANK? win? 
  If the word is PRANK? then GRAND: [x,✓,✓,✓,x]? Then next? FRANK? 
    That will be [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? Then next? PRANK? 
    Etc? 

Similar? 

I think FRANK or GRAND are good? 

Let's pick FRANK because we want to test the K-ending possibility? 

So our next guess: FRANK

After thought: Wait? We used CRANE? And not all letters: CRANE had C, R, A, N, E? 
We know C and E are not in words? 
And now? FRANK? 
Using F, R, A, N, K? 
R, A, N are repeated? 
But that's okay? Because we are testing first and last? 
We are sure about R, A, N? 

But what if the word has duplicate R? or N? 
But so far? We have no indication? 

But the feedback for CRANE: R(✓) in second? A(✓) in third? N(✓) in fourth? 

So they are already revealed? 

Hence, we guess FRANK? 

<guess>frank</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and E are not in the word (marked as x).
- R, A, and N are in the word and in their correct positions (marked as ✓), so the word has the form: _ R A N _.

Given this pattern, the secret word must be a 5-letter word with R as the second letter, A as the third, and N as the fourth. The first and last letters (positions 1 and 5) are unknown, but we know C and E are not in the word at all.

Common words fitting this pattern include:
- **BRAND**, **GRAND** (ending with D)
- **FRANK**, **PRANK**, **DRANK** (ending with K)

To maximize information and efficiency:
- Testing a word ending in K (like FRANK) quickly distinguishes between D-ending and K-ending words.
- If FRANK is correct, we solve it immediately. If not, the feedback will indicate whether the last letter is D (consistent with BRAND/GRAND) or K (consistent with PRANK/DRANK), narrowing down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Thus, ""frank"" is selected as the second guess to test position 1 (F) and position 5 (K) efficiently.

<guess>frank</guess>",frank,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x -> not in the word
  R: ✓ -> correct position (so the second letter is R)
  A: ✓ -> correct position (so the third letter is A)
  N: ✓ -> correct position (so the fourth letter is N)
  E: x -> not in the word

Therefore, we know the word has the form: _ R A N _

We know the first letter is not C, and the last letter is not E. Also, the letters C and E are not in the word at all.

Now, we need to make a second guess that fits the pattern _ R A N _ and uses only letters that are possible.

The word must be of the form: [first letter] R A N [last letter]

We should avoid using C and E because they are not in the word.

Common first letters for 5-letter words with this pattern? Some options: 
  Let's consider possible words: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, etc.

But note: we have no information about other letters yet, except that C and E are absent.

Possible words:
  BRAND: B R A N D
  GRAND: G R A N D
  FRANK: F R A N K
  PRANK: P R A N K
  DRANK: D R A N K
  TRANK: not common, but exists? Not in common word list.

We also know that the word does not have C and E.

We want to test likely letters and also get information about the first and last positions.

Since we have three correct letters already, if we can guess a word that includes common letters for the missing positions, we might solve it or get closer.

We can try ""brand"" to test B and D? But note that in our first guess, we didn't have B or D, so we don't know if they are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more letters. However, we have two unknown letters: first and last.

We can choose a word that uses many new letters to maximize information.

Possible words that fit _ R A N _ and don't contain E or C:

List of possibilities (from common words):
  BRAND: B R A N D
  GRAND: G R A N D
  FRANK: F R A N K
  PRANK: P R A N K
  DRANK: D R A N K
  WRANG: uncommon
  KRANG: uncommon

Also: TREND? But E is not allowed -> TREND has E. We know E is not in the word.

Other possibilities: 
  CRANE had C and E not present, so avoid.

We can also consider: 
  BRAWN: B R A W N -> but position 5 is W? Wait, pattern requires fifth letter unknown, but fourth is N, fifth must be the last letter.

Word: _ R A N _

BRAWN: B R A W N -> but the fourth letter would be W? No: 
Positions: 1: B, 2: R, 3: A, 4: W, 5: N -> doesn't match because third letter must be A and fourth N? 
Wait, no: the pattern is fixed: 
Position 1: unknown, Position 2: R, Position 3: A, Position 4: N, Position 5: unknown.

BRAWN has the letters: B, R, A, W, N -> so positions: 
1: B, 2: R, 3: A, 4: W -> but we need position 4 to be N? 
So BRAWN does not fit because the fourth letter must be N? 
Actually, in a 5-letter word, BRAWN: 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: W -> but we know position 4 must be N -> so W is not N. So BRAWN does not fit pattern.

Similarly, no: any word must have R in position 2, A in position 3, N in position 4.

So valid words:

BRAND: positions: 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=D -> fits pattern.
GRAND: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=D -> fits?
But wait, same fifth letter? Both BRAND and GRAND end with D? Actually, no: BRAND -> B R A N D, GRAND -> G R A N D -> both have D? 
Yes, but then we don't know if fifth is D.

FRANK: 1=F, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=K -> fits.
PRANK: 1=P, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=K -> fits.
DRANK: 1=D, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=K -> fits.

Also: URAN, but URAN is not 5 letters. Must be 5.

Others: WRANK? Not common. 
IRANI? But positions: I R A N I -> fifth letter I? That's a word? 
But it has two I's? We don't know about I. But position 2 is R? Yes: 
1: I, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: I -> word ""IRANI"" exists? As in relating to Iran? It's a proper adjective? Not universally accepted in word games? 
Usually we stick to common nouns.

We should aim for a word that tests multiple possibilities.

Given the pattern, let's list possible first letters: B, F, G, D, P, etc. and last letters: D, K.

We know from feedback that the fifth letter is not E? And not among the ones missing?

We need a second guess. We can try ""FRANK"" to test F and K? Or ""PRANK"" for P and K? 

But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are not present: C and E.

Another idea: use a word that has different vowels in the other positions? Not needed because positions 2,3,4 are fixed.

We can also try to confirm if the word is BRAND or GRAND by guessing a word that includes B and D? But we already know R, A, N are fixed.

Alternatively, we can pick a word that covers several common consonants.

Since the word has R, A, N, and we need to find first and last letters.

We can try ""brand"" as the guess? But if we guess BRAND, then:
- If it is correct, we win.
- If not, we get feedback.

But what if the word is FRANK? Then BRAND would have:
  B: not in word -> x? Because we know BRAND would have B in position 1, which for FRANK is not present? 
  Similarly, D would be in position 5? For FRANK, position 5 is K, so D is not present? 
  So we would get: B(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), D(x). Then we know the first letter is not B and last not D, so it must be F or P or something and last letter K.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't reuse letters? But the pattern forces R, A, N. So the second, third, fourth letters are fixed? 
We must keep R, A, N in positions 2,3,4? 
But we cannot change that. So our guess must have R in second position, A in third, N in fourth.

We can only vary the first and fifth.

So the guess must be of the form: [new_letter1] R A N [new_letter2]

We haven't used many letters, so we can try to test two new letters.

We need to choose new letters that are common.

Possible guesses:
  If we pick FRANK: uses F and K? Both new? We haven't had F or K.
  Or PRANK: P and K.

But note, we also haven't had B, D, G, etc.

So choosing FRANK or PRANK only tests one possibility? 

But the goal is to get the word? If we guess FRANK and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on F and K.

Similarly, if we guess BRAND and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on B and D.

But there are multiple possibilities: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, PRANK, DRANK, etc.

We can try to guess a word that has a letter which might be in the word but in a different position? 
But the known pattern is fixed: the only letters we don't know are the first and the last? 

Wait, but also: are there other letters that might be in the word? The words we listed are the common ones? 
Actually, there might be more: 
  URAN? Not 5 letters.
  TRAIN: but not matching pattern? TRAIN -> T R A I N -> positions: 1=T, 2=R, 3=A, 4=I -> but we require position 4=N? So not train.
  BRAIN: B R A I N -> position 4=I -> but we require N? So no.
  CRAN? not 5 letters.

Actually, we require position 4 to be N, so only the words with ...RAN.. with N as fourth? 

Common ones: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, PRANK, DRANK. 
Less common: TRANK? (barely used)
Also: ARANK? Not in common use.

So likely words: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, PRANK, DRANK.

Now, we have a limited set.

How many guesses do we have? This is the second guess.

We can design a guess that tests multiple these? 

We can't because the pattern forces the same R, A, N in fixed positions? 

And the words have different first and last letters? 

But note: some share the last letter? So:
  BRAND: last D?
  GRAND: last D?
  FRANK: last K?
  PRANK: last K?
  DRANK: last K?

Also, first letters: 
  BRAND: B
  GRAND: G
  FRANK: F
  PRANK: P
  DRANK: D

So we can group by last letter:
  Last D: BRAND, GRAND
  Last K: FRANK, PRANK, DRANK

We can test which group? For the fifth letter? 

But we have to fix the first letter? 

We can guess a word that does not repeat the last letter? 

For example, guess ""FRAND""? Not a word? 
We must guess a valid word. 

Given the constraints, perhaps we guess ""brand"" to test if it is D-ending? But ""brand"" has specific first letter B.

Alternatively, we might guess a word that uses F and D? But that is not a valid word? 
Possible word? FRAND -> not word? 

How about ""GRAND""? It uses G and D? 

But both G R A N D? 

We can guess ""GRAND"" to test G and D? Then:
  If it is correct, we win.
  If not, then the last letter is not D? So it must be K-endings? 

Similarly, if we guess ""FRANK"" and it is correct, we win. If not, then it might be F? 
Actually, if we guess FRANK and it's wrong, we get feedback: for F, R, A, N, K. 
We know R, A, N are correct so will show ✓ for 2,3,4? 
Then F: ??? - if F is not the first letter, then if the word is BRAND, F is not in the word? So x. Similarly, K: if last is D? then K is not present? So x. 

But we don't know the first letter? How about if FRANK is wrong? Then we see:
Position 1: F -> if not correct and not in word: x? 
Position 2: R -> ✓ 
Position 3: A -> ✓ 
Position 4: N -> ✓ 
Position 5: K -> if not correct and not in word: x? 

So we get [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, x] meaning the word has R, A, N in positions 2,3,4 and the first letter is not F and fifth is not K? But then we know it's BRAND or GRAND? 

Alternatively, if we guess BRAND and it's not correct, we get:
Position 1: B -> x? meaning B not in word? Or just not in position? 
But wait: if the word is GRAND, then B would be not present? So x? 
Position 5: D -> if word is FRANK, then D is not present? So x? 
But for GRAND: 
  If we guess BRAND and the word is GRAND, then:
  B: not in the word -> x? 
  R: ✓ 
  A: ✓ 
  N: ✓ 
  D: for GRAND, D is present? At fifth position? So if we guess BRAND, position 5 is D, same as GRAND? So D would be ✓? 
Wait, no: position 5 is D? And the word is GRAND? Which has D in position 5? So it should be ✓? 

So if the word is GRAND and we guess BRAND:
  Position 1: B -> not in GRAND? So x.
  Position 2: R -> ✓ 
  Position 3: A -> ✓ 
  Position 4: N -> ✓ 
  Position 5: D -> but GRAND has D? And we guessed D? In the same position? So ✓? 

Wait: GRAND: G R A N D -> so position 5 is D? 
If we guess BRAND: B R A N D? 
For the word GRAND, our guess B R A N D: 
  B: not in GRAND? So x? 
  R: ✓ 
  A: ✓ 
  N: ✓ 
  D: in GRAND and in position 5? So ✓? 

So feedback: [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓] -> then we know the word is ?RA N D? So we know only first letter is wrong? 

But what about GRAND? Then first letter must be G? 

Similarly, if it was BRAND? We guess BRAND? Then all ✓. 

But also, if we guess FRANK? And the word is GRAND? Then:
  F: not in word? x
  R: ✓ 
  A: ✓ 
  N: ✓ 
  K: not in word? x? 
Then we see only positions 2,3,4 correct? So form: _ R A N _ and we know F and K are absent? So then we know to look for D-ending? 

So guessing FRANK? Then if we get all except positions 1 and 5 as correct (x, ✓, ✓, ✓, x), we know:
  The first letter is not F? And last not K? Then we need a word with last D? And R A N fixed. 

But we don't know which first letter? Then we can try BRAND next? Then GRAND? 

But we have limited guesses? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""PRAND"" - but not a word? 

So perhaps we should guess one that covers letters that might appear? 

Since we have to vary first and last? 

But note: there are only two groups? 

I think the efficient way is to guess a word that covers one possibility? 

But let's look at commonality: BRAND and GRAND are common? FRANK, PRANK, DRANK are less common? 

Perhaps we can try ""grand"" to test the D-ending? 

But also, if we guess GRAND? 
  If correct? win
  If not? Then we get feedback: 
    If it's BRAND: [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓] -> we know first letter is not G, but last letter is D? So next guess: first letter must not be G? and we guess B? 
    Then if BRAND? 
    So we win in 3rd guess.

  If the word is FRANK? Then if we guess GRAND: 
    G: not in FRANK? x
    R: ✓ 
    A: ✓ 
    N: ✓ 
    D: not in FRANK? (because FRANK has F, R, A, N, K) -> x? 
? How about FRANK: the word has R at pos2, A at pos3, N at pos4? 
Our guess GRAND has G (x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), D(x). 
Then we know: word is _ R A N _ and G and D are not present? 
Then next guess: FRANK? But wait, FRANK has F? And F is not excluded? 
Then we guess FRANK? Then if correct? Win? Or if not, then PRANK or DRANK? 

But we have DRANK: D? But we just found D is not in the word? Because in GRAND we guessed D and it was x? So not present? 
So only FRANK or PRANK? 
Then we guess FRANK? If x for F? Then we guess PRANK? 

But that might take more guesses? 

Alternatively, if we guess ""frank"" first? Then:
  If correct: win
  If not? Then we get feedback: 
    For the word BRAND: 
      F: not in word? x
      R: ✓ 
      A: ✓ 
      N: ✓ 
      K: not in word? x? Then we know D-ending? 
    Then we guess BRAND? Then if win? Else? 
    If BRAND is x for B? Then we know first letter must be G? 
    Then next? 
    Guess count: 2 frank, 3 brand, 4 grand? Worst-case 4? 
  Similarly, for GRAND: also last D? So we'd see [x,✓,✓,✓,x]? Same as above? 
  Then we guess BRAND? Then if not, then GRAND? 

But worst-case 3 guesses? If we guess FRANK and it's wrong, then we know it's either BRAND or GRAND? Then guess BRAND? If wrong? Then GRAND? 

That's two more guesses? Total 3? 

But we have 6 tries? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't fix the last letter? But how? 
We have to use the pattern? 

Wait, is there a possibility that the word has duplicate letters? For example, are there words like ""URANUS""? But not 5 letters? Or random? 

So far, the word seems to be one of the ones we listed. 

We can also test a letter that appears in multiple possibilities? 
For example, what letter do we want to test? We know about R, A, N? 

But let me think: we have two positions: first and fifth? 
Common letters? 
First: B, G, F, P, D? 
Fifth: D or K? 

We can try a word that uses, say, B and K? ""blank"" -> B L A N K -> but pattern requires R at position2? 
We cannot? Because we must have R at position2? 

Unless we use R in a different position? But we know R is at position2? 
But what if our previous feedback about R being ✓ is correct? So R is fixed at position2.

Therefore, we must have R in second? 

Thus, we have to guess a word of the form: ? R A N ?

Therefore, we must choose one of the possibilities? 

I think we should pick one? 

Let's go with FRANK? 
Because it covers one of the K-ending group? 
And FRANK is a common word? 

Alternatively, BRAND is also common? 

But note: we are learning more letters? 

If we guess FRANK? We test F and K? 

Then, regardless, we get information? 

So I'll go with FRANK? 

Guess: FRANK

Positions: F R A N K

If the word is BRAND? Then feedback: F(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(x)? 
Then we know the last letter is not K? And it must end with D? 
Then we'll try BRAND next? 

If the word is GRAND? Then FRANK: F(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(x)? 
Then we know to try GRAND? 

If the word is PRANK? Then FRANK: F(x) but P is not tested? Wait, not? 
If word is PRANK? Then FRANK guess? 
Position 1: F vs P? F not present? x? 
Position 5: K vs K? ✓? 
So [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? 
Then we know the word? is ?RANK? Then we guess PRANK? 
Because we know F is not? And we haven't tried P? 

Similarly for DRANK? Then FRANK guess would be [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? So ?RANK? Then we guess DRANK? 

So worst-case: 
  If the word is PRANK? 
  Guess1: crane -> feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
  Guess2: FRANK -> feedback: F(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(✓) -> only the first letter is wrong? 
  Then we know the word ends with K? And starts with something else? 
  Then we can guess DRANK? or PRANK? 
  How to tell? We don't know the first letter? But we haven't tried P? 
  So we guess PRANK? Then if correct? Win? 
  If incorrect? Then DRANK? 

But if the word is DRANK? Then when we guess FRANK? 
Position 1: F vs D? F is not present? x? 
Position 5: K? same? ✓? 
So we see [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? 
Then we know the first letter is not F? But the fifth is K? 
Then we try PRANK? But PRANK? 
If the word is DRANK? PRANK has P? Which is not in DRANK? So:
Position 1: P? x? 
Position 5: K? ✓? 
So again [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? 
Then we know it must be DRANK? Because we tried FRANK, PRANK? So next? DRANK? 

So worst-case? We might use 4 guesses? 

But we have 6? 

We could also choose a word that has one letter common? 

Alternatively, guess ""PRANK"" instead? Similar? 

But any word we choose? 

We can choose a word that doesn't duplicate? For example, guess ""GRAND""? 
Then:
  If win? done.
  If not? Then if the word is BRAND? we get [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? meaning first letter must be B? 
  Then next guess BRAND? 
  If the word is FRANK? then [x,✓,✓,✓,x]? meaning not D-ending? So next? FRANK? 
    Then FRANK? win? 
  If the word is PRANK? then GRAND: [x,✓,✓,✓,x]? Then next? FRANK? 
    That will be [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? Then next? PRANK? 
    Etc? 

Similar? 

I think FRANK or GRAND are good? 

Let's pick FRANK because we want to test the K-ending possibility? 

So our next guess: FRANK

After thought: Wait? We used CRANE? And not all letters: CRANE had C, R, A, N, E? 
We know C and E are not in words? 
And now? FRANK? 
Using F, R, A, N, K? 
R, A, N are repeated? 
But that's okay? Because we are testing first and last? 
We are sure about R, A, N? 

But what if the word has duplicate R? or N? 
But so far? We have no indication? 

But the feedback for CRANE: R(✓) in second? A(✓) in third? N(✓) in fourth? 

So they are already revealed? 

Hence, we guess FRANK? 

<guess>frank</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and E are not in the word (marked as x).
- R, A, and N are in the word and in their correct positions (marked as ✓), so the word has the form: _ R A N _.

Given this pattern, the secret word must be a 5-letter word with R as the second letter, A as the third, and N as the fourth. The first and last letters (positions 1 and 5) are unknown, but we know C and E are not in the word at all.

Common words fitting this pattern include:
- **BRAND**, **GRAND** (ending with D)
- **FRANK**, **PRANK**, **DRANK** (ending with K)

To maximize information and efficiency:
- Testing a word ending in K (like FRANK) quickly distinguishes between D-ending and K-ending words.
- If FRANK is correct, we solve it immediately. If not, the feedback will indicate whether the last letter is D (consistent with BRAND/GRAND) or K (consistent with PRANK/DRANK), narrowing down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Thus, ""frank"" is selected as the second guess to test position 1 (F) and position 5 (K) efficiently.",Guess 2: frank -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,brand,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in word games often include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because:
   - It has 5 distinct letters.
   - It includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x -> not in the word
  R: ✓ -> correct position (so the second letter is R)
  A: ✓ -> correct position (so the third letter is A)
  N: ✓ -> correct position (so the fourth letter is N)
  E: x -> not in the word

Therefore, we know the word has the form: _ R A N _

We know the first letter is not C, and the last letter is not E. Also, the letters C and E are not in the word at all.

Now, we need to make a second guess that fits the pattern _ R A N _ and uses only letters that are possible.

The word must be of the form: [first letter] R A N [last letter]

We should avoid using C and E because they are not in the word.

Common first letters for 5-letter words with this pattern? Some options: 
  Let's consider possible words: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, etc.

But note: we have no information about other letters yet, except that C and E are absent.

Possible words:
  BRAND: B R A N D
  GRAND: G R A N D
  FRANK: F R A N K
  PRANK: P R A N K
  DRANK: D R A N K
  TRANK: not common, but exists? Not in common word list.

We also know that the word does not have C and E.

We want to test likely letters and also get information about the first and last positions.

Since we have three correct letters already, if we can guess a word that includes common letters for the missing positions, we might solve it or get closer.

We can try ""brand"" to test B and D? But note that in our first guess, we didn't have B or D, so we don't know if they are in the word.

Alternatively, we can try to cover more letters. However, we have two unknown letters: first and last.

We can choose a word that uses many new letters to maximize information.

Possible words that fit _ R A N _ and don't contain E or C:

List of possibilities (from common words):
  BRAND: B R A N D
  GRAND: G R A N D
  FRANK: F R A N K
  PRANK: P R A N K
  DRANK: D R A N K
  WRANG: uncommon
  KRANG: uncommon

Also: TREND? But E is not allowed -> TREND has E. We know E is not in the word.

Other possibilities: 
  CRANE had C and E not present, so avoid.

We can also consider: 
  BRAWN: B R A W N -> but position 5 is W? Wait, pattern requires fifth letter unknown, but fourth is N, fifth must be the last letter.

Word: _ R A N _

BRAWN: B R A W N -> but the fourth letter would be W? No: 
Positions: 1: B, 2: R, 3: A, 4: W, 5: N -> doesn't match because third letter must be A and fourth N? 
Wait, no: the pattern is fixed: 
Position 1: unknown, Position 2: R, Position 3: A, Position 4: N, Position 5: unknown.

BRAWN has the letters: B, R, A, W, N -> so positions: 
1: B, 2: R, 3: A, 4: W -> but we need position 4 to be N? 
So BRAWN does not fit because the fourth letter must be N? 
Actually, in a 5-letter word, BRAWN: 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: R
  Position 3: A
  Position 4: W -> but we know position 4 must be N -> so W is not N. So BRAWN does not fit pattern.

Similarly, no: any word must have R in position 2, A in position 3, N in position 4.

So valid words:

BRAND: positions: 1=B, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=D -> fits pattern.
GRAND: 1=G, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=D -> fits?
But wait, same fifth letter? Both BRAND and GRAND end with D? Actually, no: BRAND -> B R A N D, GRAND -> G R A N D -> both have D? 
Yes, but then we don't know if fifth is D.

FRANK: 1=F, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=K -> fits.
PRANK: 1=P, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=K -> fits.
DRANK: 1=D, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=K -> fits.

Also: URAN, but URAN is not 5 letters. Must be 5.

Others: WRANK? Not common. 
IRANI? But positions: I R A N I -> fifth letter I? That's a word? 
But it has two I's? We don't know about I. But position 2 is R? Yes: 
1: I, 2: R, 3: A, 4: N, 5: I -> word ""IRANI"" exists? As in relating to Iran? It's a proper adjective? Not universally accepted in word games? 
Usually we stick to common nouns.

We should aim for a word that tests multiple possibilities.

Given the pattern, let's list possible first letters: B, F, G, D, P, etc. and last letters: D, K.

We know from feedback that the fifth letter is not E? And not among the ones missing?

We need a second guess. We can try ""FRANK"" to test F and K? Or ""PRANK"" for P and K? 

But note: we have to avoid using letters we know are not present: C and E.

Another idea: use a word that has different vowels in the other positions? Not needed because positions 2,3,4 are fixed.

We can also try to confirm if the word is BRAND or GRAND by guessing a word that includes B and D? But we already know R, A, N are fixed.

Alternatively, we can pick a word that covers several common consonants.

Since the word has R, A, N, and we need to find first and last letters.

We can try ""brand"" as the guess? But if we guess BRAND, then:
- If it is correct, we win.
- If not, we get feedback.

But what if the word is FRANK? Then BRAND would have:
  B: not in word -> x? Because we know BRAND would have B in position 1, which for FRANK is not present? 
  Similarly, D would be in position 5? For FRANK, position 5 is K, so D is not present? 
  So we would get: B(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), D(x). Then we know the first letter is not B and last not D, so it must be F or P or something and last letter K.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't reuse letters? But the pattern forces R, A, N. So the second, third, fourth letters are fixed? 
We must keep R, A, N in positions 2,3,4? 
But we cannot change that. So our guess must have R in second position, A in third, N in fourth.

We can only vary the first and fifth.

So the guess must be of the form: [new_letter1] R A N [new_letter2]

We haven't used many letters, so we can try to test two new letters.

We need to choose new letters that are common.

Possible guesses:
  If we pick FRANK: uses F and K? Both new? We haven't had F or K.
  Or PRANK: P and K.

But note, we also haven't had B, D, G, etc.

So choosing FRANK or PRANK only tests one possibility? 

But the goal is to get the word? If we guess FRANK and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on F and K.

Similarly, if we guess BRAND and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on B and D.

But there are multiple possibilities: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, PRANK, DRANK, etc.

We can try to guess a word that has a letter which might be in the word but in a different position? 
But the known pattern is fixed: the only letters we don't know are the first and the last? 

Wait, but also: are there other letters that might be in the word? The words we listed are the common ones? 
Actually, there might be more: 
  URAN? Not 5 letters.
  TRAIN: but not matching pattern? TRAIN -> T R A I N -> positions: 1=T, 2=R, 3=A, 4=I -> but we require position 4=N? So not train.
  BRAIN: B R A I N -> position 4=I -> but we require N? So no.
  CRAN? not 5 letters.

Actually, we require position 4 to be N, so only the words with ...RAN.. with N as fourth? 

Common ones: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, PRANK, DRANK. 
Less common: TRANK? (barely used)
Also: ARANK? Not in common use.

So likely words: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, PRANK, DRANK.

Now, we have a limited set.

How many guesses do we have? This is the second guess.

We can design a guess that tests multiple these? 

We can't because the pattern forces the same R, A, N in fixed positions? 

And the words have different first and last letters? 

But note: some share the last letter? So:
  BRAND: last D?
  GRAND: last D?
  FRANK: last K?
  PRANK: last K?
  DRANK: last K?

Also, first letters: 
  BRAND: B
  GRAND: G
  FRANK: F
  PRANK: P
  DRANK: D

So we can group by last letter:
  Last D: BRAND, GRAND
  Last K: FRANK, PRANK, DRANK

We can test which group? For the fifth letter? 

But we have to fix the first letter? 

We can guess a word that does not repeat the last letter? 

For example, guess ""FRAND""? Not a word? 
We must guess a valid word. 

Given the constraints, perhaps we guess ""brand"" to test if it is D-ending? But ""brand"" has specific first letter B.

Alternatively, we might guess a word that uses F and D? But that is not a valid word? 
Possible word? FRAND -> not word? 

How about ""GRAND""? It uses G and D? 

But both G R A N D? 

We can guess ""GRAND"" to test G and D? Then:
  If it is correct, we win.
  If not, then the last letter is not D? So it must be K-endings? 

Similarly, if we guess ""FRANK"" and it is correct, we win. If not, then it might be F? 
Actually, if we guess FRANK and it's wrong, we get feedback: for F, R, A, N, K. 
We know R, A, N are correct so will show ✓ for 2,3,4? 
Then F: ??? - if F is not the first letter, then if the word is BRAND, F is not in the word? So x. Similarly, K: if last is D? then K is not present? So x. 

But we don't know the first letter? How about if FRANK is wrong? Then we see:
Position 1: F -> if not correct and not in word: x? 
Position 2: R -> ✓ 
Position 3: A -> ✓ 
Position 4: N -> ✓ 
Position 5: K -> if not correct and not in word: x? 

So we get [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, x] meaning the word has R, A, N in positions 2,3,4 and the first letter is not F and fifth is not K? But then we know it's BRAND or GRAND? 

Alternatively, if we guess BRAND and it's not correct, we get:
Position 1: B -> x? meaning B not in word? Or just not in position? 
But wait: if the word is GRAND, then B would be not present? So x? 
Position 5: D -> if word is FRANK, then D is not present? So x? 
But for GRAND: 
  If we guess BRAND and the word is GRAND, then:
  B: not in the word -> x? 
  R: ✓ 
  A: ✓ 
  N: ✓ 
  D: for GRAND, D is present? At fifth position? So if we guess BRAND, position 5 is D, same as GRAND? So D would be ✓? 
Wait, no: position 5 is D? And the word is GRAND? Which has D in position 5? So it should be ✓? 

So if the word is GRAND and we guess BRAND:
  Position 1: B -> not in GRAND? So x.
  Position 2: R -> ✓ 
  Position 3: A -> ✓ 
  Position 4: N -> ✓ 
  Position 5: D -> but GRAND has D? And we guessed D? In the same position? So ✓? 

Wait: GRAND: G R A N D -> so position 5 is D? 
If we guess BRAND: B R A N D? 
For the word GRAND, our guess B R A N D: 
  B: not in GRAND? So x? 
  R: ✓ 
  A: ✓ 
  N: ✓ 
  D: in GRAND and in position 5? So ✓? 

So feedback: [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓] -> then we know the word is ?RA N D? So we know only first letter is wrong? 

But what about GRAND? Then first letter must be G? 

Similarly, if it was BRAND? We guess BRAND? Then all ✓. 

But also, if we guess FRANK? And the word is GRAND? Then:
  F: not in word? x
  R: ✓ 
  A: ✓ 
  N: ✓ 
  K: not in word? x? 
Then we see only positions 2,3,4 correct? So form: _ R A N _ and we know F and K are absent? So then we know to look for D-ending? 

So guessing FRANK? Then if we get all except positions 1 and 5 as correct (x, ✓, ✓, ✓, x), we know:
  The first letter is not F? And last not K? Then we need a word with last D? And R A N fixed. 

But we don't know which first letter? Then we can try BRAND next? Then GRAND? 

But we have limited guesses? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""PRAND"" - but not a word? 

So perhaps we should guess one that covers letters that might appear? 

Since we have to vary first and last? 

But note: there are only two groups? 

I think the efficient way is to guess a word that covers one possibility? 

But let's look at commonality: BRAND and GRAND are common? FRANK, PRANK, DRANK are less common? 

Perhaps we can try ""grand"" to test the D-ending? 

But also, if we guess GRAND? 
  If correct? win
  If not? Then we get feedback: 
    If it's BRAND: [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓] -> we know first letter is not G, but last letter is D? So next guess: first letter must not be G? and we guess B? 
    Then if BRAND? 
    So we win in 3rd guess.

  If the word is FRANK? Then if we guess GRAND: 
    G: not in FRANK? x
    R: ✓ 
    A: ✓ 
    N: ✓ 
    D: not in FRANK? (because FRANK has F, R, A, N, K) -> x? 
? How about FRANK: the word has R at pos2, A at pos3, N at pos4? 
Our guess GRAND has G (x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), D(x). 
Then we know: word is _ R A N _ and G and D are not present? 
Then next guess: FRANK? But wait, FRANK has F? And F is not excluded? 
Then we guess FRANK? Then if correct? Win? Or if not, then PRANK or DRANK? 

But we have DRANK: D? But we just found D is not in the word? Because in GRAND we guessed D and it was x? So not present? 
So only FRANK or PRANK? 
Then we guess FRANK? If x for F? Then we guess PRANK? 

But that might take more guesses? 

Alternatively, if we guess ""frank"" first? Then:
  If correct: win
  If not? Then we get feedback: 
    For the word BRAND: 
      F: not in word? x
      R: ✓ 
      A: ✓ 
      N: ✓ 
      K: not in word? x? Then we know D-ending? 
    Then we guess BRAND? Then if win? Else? 
    If BRAND is x for B? Then we know first letter must be G? 
    Then next? 
    Guess count: 2 frank, 3 brand, 4 grand? Worst-case 4? 
  Similarly, for GRAND: also last D? So we'd see [x,✓,✓,✓,x]? Same as above? 
  Then we guess BRAND? Then if not, then GRAND? 

But worst-case 3 guesses? If we guess FRANK and it's wrong, then we know it's either BRAND or GRAND? Then guess BRAND? If wrong? Then GRAND? 

That's two more guesses? Total 3? 

But we have 6 tries? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't fix the last letter? But how? 
We have to use the pattern? 

Wait, is there a possibility that the word has duplicate letters? For example, are there words like ""URANUS""? But not 5 letters? Or random? 

So far, the word seems to be one of the ones we listed. 

We can also test a letter that appears in multiple possibilities? 
For example, what letter do we want to test? We know about R, A, N? 

But let me think: we have two positions: first and fifth? 
Common letters? 
First: B, G, F, P, D? 
Fifth: D or K? 

We can try a word that uses, say, B and K? ""blank"" -> B L A N K -> but pattern requires R at position2? 
We cannot? Because we must have R at position2? 

Unless we use R in a different position? But we know R is at position2? 
But what if our previous feedback about R being ✓ is correct? So R is fixed at position2.

Therefore, we must have R in second? 

Thus, we have to guess a word of the form: ? R A N ?

Therefore, we must choose one of the possibilities? 

I think we should pick one? 

Let's go with FRANK? 
Because it covers one of the K-ending group? 
And FRANK is a common word? 

Alternatively, BRAND is also common? 

But note: we are learning more letters? 

If we guess FRANK? We test F and K? 

Then, regardless, we get information? 

So I'll go with FRANK? 

Guess: FRANK

Positions: F R A N K

If the word is BRAND? Then feedback: F(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(x)? 
Then we know the last letter is not K? And it must end with D? 
Then we'll try BRAND next? 

If the word is GRAND? Then FRANK: F(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(x)? 
Then we know to try GRAND? 

If the word is PRANK? Then FRANK: F(x) but P is not tested? Wait, not? 
If word is PRANK? Then FRANK guess? 
Position 1: F vs P? F not present? x? 
Position 5: K vs K? ✓? 
So [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? 
Then we know the word? is ?RANK? Then we guess PRANK? 
Because we know F is not? And we haven't tried P? 

Similarly for DRANK? Then FRANK guess would be [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? So ?RANK? Then we guess DRANK? 

So worst-case: 
  If the word is PRANK? 
  Guess1: crane -> feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
  Guess2: FRANK -> feedback: F(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(✓) -> only the first letter is wrong? 
  Then we know the word ends with K? And starts with something else? 
  Then we can guess DRANK? or PRANK? 
  How to tell? We don't know the first letter? But we haven't tried P? 
  So we guess PRANK? Then if correct? Win? 
  If incorrect? Then DRANK? 

But if the word is DRANK? Then when we guess FRANK? 
Position 1: F vs D? F is not present? x? 
Position 5: K? same? ✓? 
So we see [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? 
Then we know the first letter is not F? But the fifth is K? 
Then we try PRANK? But PRANK? 
If the word is DRANK? PRANK has P? Which is not in DRANK? So:
Position 1: P? x? 
Position 5: K? ✓? 
So again [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? 
Then we know it must be DRANK? Because we tried FRANK, PRANK? So next? DRANK? 

So worst-case? We might use 4 guesses? 

But we have 6? 

We could also choose a word that has one letter common? 

Alternatively, guess ""PRANK"" instead? Similar? 

But any word we choose? 

We can choose a word that doesn't duplicate? For example, guess ""GRAND""? 
Then:
  If win? done.
  If not? Then if the word is BRAND? we get [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? meaning first letter must be B? 
  Then next guess BRAND? 
  If the word is FRANK? then [x,✓,✓,✓,x]? meaning not D-ending? So next? FRANK? 
    Then FRANK? win? 
  If the word is PRANK? then GRAND: [x,✓,✓,✓,x]? Then next? FRANK? 
    That will be [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? Then next? PRANK? 
    Etc? 

Similar? 

I think FRANK or GRAND are good? 

Let's pick FRANK because we want to test the K-ending possibility? 

So our next guess: FRANK

After thought: Wait? We used CRANE? And not all letters: CRANE had C, R, A, N, E? 
We know C and E are not in words? 
And now? FRANK? 
Using F, R, A, N, K? 
R, A, N are repeated? 
But that's okay? Because we are testing first and last? 
We are sure about R, A, N? 

But what if the word has duplicate R? or N? 
But so far? We have no indication? 

But the feedback for CRANE: R(✓) in second? A(✓) in third? N(✓) in fourth? 

So they are already revealed? 

Hence, we guess FRANK? 

<guess>frank</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C and E are not in the word (marked as x).
- R, A, and N are in the word and in their correct positions (marked as ✓), so the word has the form: _ R A N _.

Given this pattern, the secret word must be a 5-letter word with R as the second letter, A as the third, and N as the fourth. The first and last letters (positions 1 and 5) are unknown, but we know C and E are not in the word at all.

Common words fitting this pattern include:
- **BRAND**, **GRAND** (ending with D)
- **FRANK**, **PRANK**, **DRANK** (ending with K)

To maximize information and efficiency:
- Testing a word ending in K (like FRANK) quickly distinguishes between D-ending and K-ending words.
- If FRANK is correct, we solve it immediately. If not, the feedback will indicate whether the last letter is D (consistent with BRAND/GRAND) or K (consistent with PRANK/DRANK), narrowing down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Thus, ""frank"" is selected as the second guess to test position 1 (F) and position 5 (K) efficiently.

Both new? We haven\'t had F or K.\n  Or PRANK: P and K.\n\nBut note, we also haven\'t had B, D, G, etc.\n\nSo choosing FRANK or PRANK only tests one possibility? \n\nBut the goal is to get the word? If we guess FRANK and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on F and K.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess BRAND and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on B and D.\n\nBut there are multiple possibilities: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, PRANK, DRANK, etc.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has a letter which might be in the word but in a different position? \nBut the known pattern is fixed: the only letters we don\'t know are the first and the last? \n\nWait, but also: are there other letters that might be in the word? The words we listed are the common ones? \nActually, there might be more: \n  URAN? Not 5 letters.\n  TRAIN: but not matching pattern? TRAIN -> T R A I N -> positions: 1=T, 2=R, 3=A, 4=I -> but we require position 4=N? So not train.\n  BRAIN: B R A I N -> position 4=I -> but we require N? So no.\n  CRAN? not 5 letters.\n\nActually, we require position 4 to be N, so only the words with ...RAN.. with N as fourth? \n\nCommon ones: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, PRANK, DRANK. \nLess common: TRANK? (barely used)\nAlso: ARANK? Not in common use.\n\nSo likely words: BRAND, GRAND, FRANK, PRANK, DRANK.\n\nNow, we have a limited set.\n\nHow many guesses do we have? This is the second guess.\n\nWe can design a guess that tests multiple these? \n\nWe can\'t because the pattern forces the same R, A, N in fixed positions? \n\nAnd the words have different first and last letters? \n\nBut note: some share the last letter? So:\n  BRAND: last D?\n  GRAND: last D?\n  FRANK: last K?\n  PRANK: last K?\n  DRANK: last K?\n\nAlso, first letters: \n  BRAND: B\n  GRAND: G\n  FRANK: F\n  PRANK: P\n  DRANK: D\n\nSo we can group by last letter:\n  Last D: BRAND, GRAND\n  Last K: FRANK, PRANK, DRANK\n\nWe can test which group? For the fifth letter? \n\nBut we have to fix the first letter? \n\nWe can guess a word that does not repeat the last letter? \n\nFor example, guess ""FRAND""? Not a word? \nWe must guess a valid word. \n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps we guess ""brand"" to test if it is D-ending? But ""brand"" has specific first letter B.\n\nAlternatively, we might guess a word that uses F and D? But that is not a valid word? \nPossible word? FRAND -> not word? \n\nHow about ""GRAND""? It uses G and D? \n\nBut both G R A N D? \n\nWe can guess ""GRAND"" to test G and D? Then:\n  If it is correct, we win.\n  If not, then the last letter is not D? So it must be K-endings? \n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""FRANK"" and it is correct, we win. If not, then it might be F? \nActually, if we guess FRANK and it\'s wrong, we get feedback: for F, R, A, N, K. \nWe know R, A, N are correct so will show ✓ for 2,3,4? \nThen F: ??? - if F is not the first letter, then if the word is BRAND, F is not in the word? So x. Similarly, K: if last is D? then K is not present? So x. \n\nBut we don\'t know the first letter? How about if FRANK is wrong? Then we see:\nPosition 1: F -> if not correct and not in word: x? \nPosition 2: R -> ✓ \nPosition 3: A -> ✓ \nPosition 4: N -> ✓ \nPosition 5: K -> if not correct and not in word: x? \n\nSo we get [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, x] meaning the word has R, A, N in positions 2,3,4 and the first letter is not F and fifth is not K? But then we know it\'s BRAND or GRAND? \n\nAlternatively, if we guess BRAND and it\'s not correct, we get:\nPosition 1: B -> x? meaning B not in word? Or just not in position? \nBut wait: if the word is GRAND, then B would be not present? So x? \nPosition 5: D -> if word is FRANK, then D is not present? So x? \nBut for GRAND: \n  If we guess BRAND and the word is GRAND, then:\n  B: not in the word -> x? \n  R: ✓ \n  A: ✓ \n  N: ✓ \n  D: for GRAND, D is present? At fifth position? So if we guess BRAND, position 5 is D, same as GRAND? So D would be ✓? \nWait, no: position 5 is D? And the word is GRAND? Which has D in position 5? So it should be ✓? \n\nSo if the word is GRAND and we guess BRAND:\n  Position 1: B -> not in GRAND? So x.\n  Position 2: R -> ✓ \n  Position 3: A -> ✓ \n  Position 4: N -> ✓ \n  Position 5: D -> but GRAND has D? And we guessed D? In the same position? So ✓? \n\nWait: GRAND: G R A N D -> so position 5 is D? \nIf we guess BRAND: B R A N D? \nFor the word GRAND, our guess B R A N D: \n  B: not in GRAND? So x? \n  R: ✓ \n  A: ✓ \n  N: ✓ \n  D: in GRAND and in position 5? So ✓? \n\nSo feedback: [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓] -> then we know the word is ?RA N D? So we know only first letter is wrong? \n\nBut what about GRAND? Then first letter must be G? \n\nSimilarly, if it was BRAND? We guess BRAND? Then all ✓. \n\nBut also, if we guess FRANK? And the word is GRAND? Then:\n  F: not in word? x\n  R: ✓ \n  A: ✓ \n  N: ✓ \n  K: not in word? x? \nThen we see only positions 2,3,4 correct? So form: _ R A N _ and we know F and K are absent? So then we know to look for D-ending? \n\nSo guessing FRANK? Then if we get all except positions 1 and 5 as correct (x, ✓, ✓, ✓, x), we know:\n  The first letter is not F? And last not K? Then we need a word with last D? And R A N fixed. \n\nBut we don\'t know which first letter? Then we can try BRAND next? Then GRAND? \n\nBut we have limited guesses? \n\nAlternatively, we can guess ""PRAND"" - but not a word? \n\nSo perhaps we should guess one that covers letters that might appear? \n\nSince we have to vary first and last? \n\nBut note: there are only two groups? \n\nI think the efficient way is to guess a word that covers one possibility? \n\nBut let\'s look at commonality: BRAND and GRAND are common? FRANK, PRANK, DRANK are less common? \n\nPerhaps we can try ""grand"" to test the D-ending? \n\nBut also, if we guess GRAND? \n  If correct? win\n  If not? Then we get feedback: \n    If it\'s BRAND: [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓] -> we know first letter is not G, but last letter is D? So next guess: first letter must not be G? and we guess B? \n    Then if BRAND? \n    So we win in 3rd guess.\n\n  If the word is FRANK? Then if we guess GRAND: \n    G: not in FRANK? x\n    R: ✓ \n    A: ✓ \n    N: ✓ \n    D: not in FRANK? (because FRANK has F, R, A, N, K) -> x? \n? How about FRANK: the word has R at pos2, A at pos3, N at pos4? \nOur guess GRAND has G (x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), D(x). \nThen we know: word is _ R A N _ and G and D are not present? \nThen next guess: FRANK? But wait, FRANK has F? And F is not excluded? \nThen we guess FRANK? Then if correct? Win? Or if not, then PRANK or DRANK? \n\nBut we have DRANK: D? But we just found D is not in the word? Because in GRAND we guessed D and it was x? So not present? \nSo only FRANK or PRANK? \nThen we guess FRANK? If x for F? Then we guess PRANK? \n\nBut that might take more guesses? \n\nAlternatively, if we guess ""frank"" first? Then:\n  If correct: win\n  If not? Then we get feedback: \n    For the word BRAND: \n      F: not in word? x\n      R: ✓ \n      A: ✓ \n      N: ✓ \n      K: not in word? x? Then we know D-ending? \n    Then we guess BRAND? Then if win? Else? \n    If BRAND is x for B? Then we know first letter must be G? \n    Then next? \n    Guess count: 2 frank, 3 brand, 4 grand? Worst-case 4? \n  Similarly, for GRAND: also last D? So we\'d see [x,✓,✓,✓,x]? Same as above? \n  Then we guess BRAND? Then if not, then GRAND? \n\nBut worst-case 3 guesses? If we guess FRANK and it\'s wrong, then we know it\'s either BRAND or GRAND? Then guess BRAND? If wrong? Then GRAND? \n\nThat\'s two more guesses? Total 3? \n\nBut we have 6 tries? \n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that doesn\'t fix the last letter? But how? \nWe have to use the pattern? \n\nWait, is there a possibility that the word has duplicate letters? For example, are there words like ""URANUS""? But not 5 letters? Or random? \n\nSo far, the word seems to be one of the ones we listed. \n\nWe can also test a letter that appears in multiple possibilities? \nFor example, what letter do we want to test? We know about R, A, N? \n\nBut let me think: we have two positions: first and fifth? \nCommon letters? \nFirst: B, G, F, P, D? \nFifth: D or K? \n\nWe can try a word that uses, say, B and K? ""blank"" -> B L A N K -> but pattern requires R at position2? \nWe cannot? Because we must have R at position2? \n\nUnless we use R in a different position? But we know R is at position2? \nBut what if our previous feedback about R being ✓ is correct? So R is fixed at position2.\n\nTherefore, we must have R in second? \n\nThus, we have to guess a word of the form: ? R A N ?\n\nTherefore, we must choose one of the possibilities? \n\nI think we should pick one? \n\nLet\'s go with FRANK? \nBecause it covers one of the K-ending group? \nAnd FRANK is a common word? \n\nAlternatively, BRAND is also common? \n\nBut note: we are learning more letters? \n\nIf we guess FRANK? We test F and K? \n\nThen, regardless, we get information? \n\nSo I\'ll go with FRANK? \n\nGuess: FRANK\n\nPositions: F R A N K\n\nIf the word is BRAND? Then feedback: F(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(x)? \nThen we know the last letter is not K? And it must end with D? \nThen we\'ll try BRAND next? \n\nIf the word is GRAND? Then FRANK: F(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(x)? \nThen we know to try GRAND? \n\nIf the word is PRANK? Then FRANK: F(x) but P is not tested? Wait, not? \nIf word is PRANK? Then FRANK guess? \nPosition 1: F vs P? F not present? x? \nPosition 5: K vs K? ✓? \nSo [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? \nThen we know the word? is ?RANK? Then we guess PRANK? \nBecause we know F is not? And we haven\'t tried P? \n\nSimilarly for DRANK? Then FRANK guess would be [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? So ?RANK? Then we guess DRANK? \n\nSo worst-case: \n  If the word is PRANK? \n  Guess1: crane -> feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)\n  Guess2: FRANK -> feedback: F(x), R(✓), A(✓), N(✓), K(✓) -> only the first letter is wrong? \n  Then we know the word ends with K? And starts with something else? \n  Then we can guess DRANK? or PRANK? \n  How to tell? We don\'t know the first letter? But we haven\'t tried P? \n  So we guess PRANK? Then if correct? Win? \n  If incorrect? Then DRANK? \n\nBut if the word is DRANK? Then when we guess FRANK? \nPosition 1: F vs D? F is not present? x? \nPosition 5: K? same? ✓? \nSo we see [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? \nThen we know the first letter is not F? But the fifth is K? \nThen we try PRANK? But PRANK? \nIf the word is DRANK? PRANK has P? Which is not in DRANK? So:\nPosition 1: P? x? \nPosition 5: K? ✓? \nSo again [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? \nThen we know it must be DRANK? Because we tried FRANK, PRANK? So next? DRANK? \n\nSo worst-case? We might use 4 guesses? \n\nBut we have 6? \n\nWe could also choose a word that has one letter common? \n\nAlternatively, guess ""PRANK"" instead? Similar? \n\nBut any word we choose? \n\nWe can choose a word that doesn\'t duplicate? For example, guess ""GRAND""? \nThen:\n  If win? done.\n  If not? Then if the word is BRAND? we get [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? meaning first letter must be B? \n  Then next guess BRAND? \n  If the word is FRANK? then [x,✓,✓,✓,x]? meaning not D-ending? So next? FRANK? \n    Then FRANK? win? \n  If the word is PRANK? then GRAND: [x,✓,✓,✓,x]? Then next? FRANK? \n    That will be [x,✓,✓,✓,✓]? Then next? PRANK? \n    Etc? \n\nSimilar? \n\nI think FRANK or GRAND are good? \n\nLet\'s pick FRANK because we want to test the K-ending possibility? \n\nSo our next guess: FRANK\n\nAfter thought: Wait? We used CRANE? And not all letters: CRANE had C, R, A, N, E? \nWe know C and E are not in words? \nAnd now? FRANK? \nUsing F, R, A, N, K? \nR, A, N are repeated? \nBut that\'s okay? Because we are testing first and last? \nWe are sure about R, A, N? \n\nBut what if the word has duplicate R? or N? \nBut so far? We have no indication? \n\nBut the feedback for CRANE: R(✓) in second? A(✓) in third? N(✓) in fourth? \n\nSo they are already revealed? \n\nHence, we guess FRANK? \n\n<guess>frank</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C and E are not in the word (marked as x).\n- R, A, and N are in the word and in their correct positions (marked as ✓), so the word has the form: _ R A N _.\n\nGiven this pattern, the secret word must be a 5-letter word with R as the second letter, A as the third, and N as the fourth. The first and last letters (positions 1 and 5) are unknown, but we know C and E are not in the word at all.\n\nCommon words fitting this pattern include:\n- **BRAND**, **GRAND** (ending with D)\n- **FRANK**, **PRANK**, **DRANK** (ending with K)\n\nTo maximize information and efficiency:\n- Testing a word ending in K (like FRANK) quickly distinguishes between D-ending and K-ending words.\n- If FRANK is correct, we solve it immediately. If not, the feedback will indicate whether the last letter is D (consistent with BRAND/GRAND) or K (consistent with PRANK/DRANK), narrowing down the possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\nThus, ""frank"" is selected as the second guess to test position 1 (F) and position 5 (K) efficiently.\n\n<guess>frank</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: frank -> FEEDBACK: F(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
This means:
  - C is not in the word at all.
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
  - E is not in the word at all.

So the word has the form: _ R A N _

Also, we know that C and E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""frank"" -> F(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(x)
This means:
  - F is not in the word at all.
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2) - already known.
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) - already known.
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) - already known.
  - K is not in the word at all.

So now we know that F and K are also not in the word.

Therefore, the word is of the form: _ R A N _

And the letters not in the word: C, E, F, K.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits _ R A N _ and does not contain C, E, F, K.

Common words that fit the pattern _ R A N _:

- BRAND: B R A N D
- GRAND: G R A N D
- PRANK: but K is not in the word, so PRANK is invalid (because it has K)
- DRANK: has K? DRANK ends with K? Yes, so invalid because K is not in the word.
- Other possibilities: 
  - BRAND and GRAND are the main ones? 
  - Also, WRAN? Not 5 letters.
  - URAN? Not 5.
  - ARENA? But pattern: A R E N A -> doesn't match because position 3 must be A? It is, but position 4 must be N? It is? But position 3 is E? Wait: ARENA: 
      Position 1: A, 2: R, 3: E, 4: N, 5: A -> but we require position 3 to be A? So no, because position 3 is E? 
  - ORANG? Not 5? 
  - CRAN? Not 5.

But note: we have the pattern _ R A N _ so:
  Position 1: must be a letter not in {C, E, F, K}
  Position 5: must be a letter not in {C, E, F, K}

And the word must be a valid English word.

So BRAND: B R A N D -> B and D are allowed? 
  B is not excluded? D is not excluded? 
GRAND: G R A N D -> G and D allowed? 

Are there other words? 
  DRAND? Not a word.
  PRAND? Not a word.
  TRAND? Not common? 
  WRAND? Not common.

But also: BRANS? Not 5? 
BRAN? Not 5.

Another possibility: ""URBAN""? But pattern: U R B A N -> positions: 
  1: U, 2: R, 3: B, 4: A -> but we require position 3 to be A? So no.

""ORGAN"": O R G A N -> positions: 
  1: O, 2: R, 3: G, 4: A -> but we require position 3 to be A? So no.

""TRAIN"": T R A I N -> positions: 
  1: T, 2: R, 3: A, 4: I -> but we require position 4 to be N? So no.

""BRAWN"": B R A W N -> positions: 
  1: B, 2: R, 3: A, 4: W -> but we require position 4 to be N? So no.

Therefore, the only common words are BRAND and GRAND.

We need to choose between BRAND and GRAND.

We can guess one of them? 

But note: we have not used B, G, D in any guess? So we don't know about them? 

We can guess ""brand"" to test B and D? 

If we guess ""brand"":
  If the word is BRAND, we win.
  If the word is GRAND, then we get:
      Position 1: B -> not in GRAND? So x? 
      Position 2: R -> ✓ 
      Position 3: A -> ✓ 
      Position 4: N -> ✓ 
      Position 5: D -> in GRAND? Yes, and in position 5? So ✓? 
      So feedback: [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓]? 
      Then we know the first letter is wrong? But the last is correct? 
      Then we can guess GRAND? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that includes both B and G? But we have to fit the pattern? 

But we cannot? Because the pattern is fixed? 

We can only vary the first and last? 

But we have two possibilities? 

We can guess ""grand"" first? 

But let's see: 

If we guess ""brand"" and it's wrong? Then we know it must be GRAND? 

Similarly, if we guess ""grand"" and it's wrong? Then it must be BRAND? 

So we can choose either? 

I'll choose ""brand"" as the next guess? 

But note: we have 6 tries? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple letters? But we don't have other positions? 

So I think we should guess ""brand"". 

But let me confirm: 

After guess 2, we know:
  The word is either BRAND or GRAND? 

So we can guess BRAND? 

If it's correct: done. 
If not: then we know it's GRAND? 

So next guess would be GRAND? 

But we can do it in two more guesses? 

But we can also try to guess a word that is not one of them? But why? 

We have no other information? 

So I think ""brand"" is a good guess? 

But note: we haven't used D? But we are going to use it? 

We can also consider: is there a word that has G and B? But we cannot because the pattern forces the first letter? 

So I think we go with ""brand"". 

Guess: brand

But let's write it: <guess>brand</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)  
  This reveals:
  - R, A, and N are in the word and in positions 2, 3, and 4, respectively (so the word pattern is `_ R A N _`).
  - C and E are **not** in the word.

- **Guess 2: ""frank""** → Feedback: F(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(x)  
  This adds:
  - F and K are **not** in the word.
  - R, A, and N remain confirmed in positions 2, 3, and 4.

### Analysis:
- The word pattern is fixed: **Position 2 = R, Position 3 = A, Position 4 = N**.
- **Excluded letters**: C, E, F, K (not in the word at all).
- **Unknown positions**: Only Position 1 and Position 5 need to be solved.
- Possible words fitting the pattern and constraints:
  - **BRAND**: Ends with `D` (Position 5 = D).
  - **GRAND**: Ends with `D` (Position 5 = D).
  - Other options like FRANK, PRANK, or DRANK are invalid (they contain F, K, or are excluded by feedback).

Since BRAND and GRAND are the only common words matching the pattern and constraints, we can test **BRAND** to resolve the solution:
- If correct, we solve the puzzle.
- If incorrect, the word must be **GRAND** (and we can guess it next).

This approach efficiently narrows down the possibilities with minimal guesses.

<guess>brand</guess>",brand,"We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
This means:
  - C is not in the word at all.
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3).
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
  - E is not in the word at all.

So the word has the form: _ R A N _

Also, we know that C and E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""frank"" -> F(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(x)
This means:
  - F is not in the word at all.
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2) - already known.
  - A is in the word and in the correct position (position 3) - already known.
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (position 4) - already known.
  - K is not in the word at all.

So now we know that F and K are also not in the word.

Therefore, the word is of the form: _ R A N _

And the letters not in the word: C, E, F, K.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits _ R A N _ and does not contain C, E, F, K.

Common words that fit the pattern _ R A N _:

- BRAND: B R A N D
- GRAND: G R A N D
- PRANK: but K is not in the word, so PRANK is invalid (because it has K)
- DRANK: has K? DRANK ends with K? Yes, so invalid because K is not in the word.
- Other possibilities: 
  - BRAND and GRAND are the main ones? 
  - Also, WRAN? Not 5 letters.
  - URAN? Not 5.
  - ARENA? But pattern: A R E N A -> doesn't match because position 3 must be A? It is, but position 4 must be N? It is? But position 3 is E? Wait: ARENA: 
      Position 1: A, 2: R, 3: E, 4: N, 5: A -> but we require position 3 to be A? So no, because position 3 is E? 
  - ORANG? Not 5? 
  - CRAN? Not 5.

But note: we have the pattern _ R A N _ so:
  Position 1: must be a letter not in {C, E, F, K}
  Position 5: must be a letter not in {C, E, F, K}

And the word must be a valid English word.

So BRAND: B R A N D -> B and D are allowed? 
  B is not excluded? D is not excluded? 
GRAND: G R A N D -> G and D allowed? 

Are there other words? 
  DRAND? Not a word.
  PRAND? Not a word.
  TRAND? Not common? 
  WRAND? Not common.

But also: BRANS? Not 5? 
BRAN? Not 5.

Another possibility: ""URBAN""? But pattern: U R B A N -> positions: 
  1: U, 2: R, 3: B, 4: A -> but we require position 3 to be A? So no.

""ORGAN"": O R G A N -> positions: 
  1: O, 2: R, 3: G, 4: A -> but we require position 3 to be A? So no.

""TRAIN"": T R A I N -> positions: 
  1: T, 2: R, 3: A, 4: I -> but we require position 4 to be N? So no.

""BRAWN"": B R A W N -> positions: 
  1: B, 2: R, 3: A, 4: W -> but we require position 4 to be N? So no.

Therefore, the only common words are BRAND and GRAND.

We need to choose between BRAND and GRAND.

We can guess one of them? 

But note: we have not used B, G, D in any guess? So we don't know about them? 

We can guess ""brand"" to test B and D? 

If we guess ""brand"":
  If the word is BRAND, we win.
  If the word is GRAND, then we get:
      Position 1: B -> not in GRAND? So x? 
      Position 2: R -> ✓ 
      Position 3: A -> ✓ 
      Position 4: N -> ✓ 
      Position 5: D -> in GRAND? Yes, and in position 5? So ✓? 
      So feedback: [x, ✓, ✓, ✓, ✓]? 
      Then we know the first letter is wrong? But the last is correct? 
      Then we can guess GRAND? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that includes both B and G? But we have to fit the pattern? 

But we cannot? Because the pattern is fixed? 

We can only vary the first and last? 

But we have two possibilities? 

We can guess ""grand"" first? 

But let's see: 

If we guess ""brand"" and it's wrong? Then we know it must be GRAND? 

Similarly, if we guess ""grand"" and it's wrong? Then it must be BRAND? 

So we can choose either? 

I'll choose ""brand"" as the next guess? 

But note: we have 6 tries? 

Alternatively, we can use a word that tests multiple letters? But we don't have other positions? 

So I think we should guess ""brand"". 

But let me confirm: 

After guess 2, we know:
  The word is either BRAND or GRAND? 

So we can guess BRAND? 

If it's correct: done. 
If not: then we know it's GRAND? 

So next guess would be GRAND? 

But we can do it in two more guesses? 

But we can also try to guess a word that is not one of them? But why? 

We have no other information? 

So I think ""brand"" is a good guess? 

But note: we haven't used D? But we are going to use it? 

We can also consider: is there a word that has G and B? But we cannot because the pattern forces the first letter? 

So I think we go with ""brand"". 

Guess: brand

But let's write it: <guess>brand</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)  
  This reveals:
  - R, A, and N are in the word and in positions 2, 3, and 4, respectively (so the word pattern is `_ R A N _`).
  - C and E are **not** in the word.

- **Guess 2: ""frank""** → Feedback: F(x) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) K(x)  
  This adds:
  - F and K are **not** in the word.
  - R, A, and N remain confirmed in positions 2, 3, and 4.

### Analysis:
- The word pattern is fixed: **Position 2 = R, Position 3 = A, Position 4 = N**.
- **Excluded letters**: C, E, F, K (not in the word at all).
- **Unknown positions**: Only Position 1 and Position 5 need to be solved.
- Possible words fitting the pattern and constraints:
  - **BRAND**: Ends with `D` (Position 5 = D).
  - **GRAND**: Ends with `D` (Position 5 = D).
  - Other options like FRANK, PRANK, or DRANK are invalid (they contain F, K, or are excluded by feedback).

Since BRAND and GRAND are the only common words matching the pattern and constraints, we can test **BRAND** to resolve the solution:
- If correct, we solve the puzzle.
- If incorrect, the word must be **GRAND** (and we can guess it next).

This approach efficiently narrows down the possibilities with minimal guesses.",Guess 3: brand -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) R(✓) A(✓) N(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
