We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we need a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common letters in English include vowels (A,E,I,O,U) and frequent consonants (R,S,T,L,N, etc.).
 Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", etc. We'll choose one that balances common letters and frequency.

 Let's choose ""ROATE"". Why?
 - It has relatively common letters: R, O, A, T, E.
 - It contains three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T).

 However, note that the rules require 5-letter English words. ""ROATE"" is a valid word (it is a financial term meaning the profit from an investment).

 We'll go with ""ROATE"".

 If the user says we cannot use this word, we might pick another, but for now, let's use it.

 Thus, our first guess: ROATE.
</think>
For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover frequent letters. After considering options, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- C, R, A, N, and E are all highly frequent in English words.
- This combination helps test multiple letter positions broadly.

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(-)
 Interpretation:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since the word is 1-based: position 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E).
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed A at position 3, it must be elsewhere (either position 1, 4, or 5? but positions are fixed). Actually, A could be in positions 1, 4, or 5? Note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But A is not in position 3 because we got a dash (meaning wrong position). Also, we know position 2 is R (correct).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so not at position 5? because we placed it at position 5 and got dash). Similarly, E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4? But not position 2 because that is R (which is fixed).
 - C and N are not in the word at all.

 So what we know:
 - The second letter is R (position 2).
 - The word contains A and E, but not at the positions we guessed: 
      A is not at position 3 (because we got dash for wrong position), 
      E is not at position 5 (because we got dash).
 - The word does not contain C or N.

 Also, since A is in the word but not at position 3, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we must place them elsewhere.

 Possible positions for A: must be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But note: position 2 is taken by R, so A cannot be there. Similarly, for E: positions 1, 3, or 4? Because position 2 is R.

 However, we must also consider that the word has exactly 5 letters and we know one letter (R at position 2).

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]
 And we know:
 - letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5 are unknown.
 - The word includes A and E (each exactly once? but we don't know if there are duplicates). However, without more info, we assume unique unless proven otherwise.

 Also, we know that A is not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 4, or 5) and E is not at position 5 (so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4).

 Since C and N are out, we avoid those letters.

 We have two new letters to place: A and E.

 Strategy for the next guess:
 - We want to confirm the positions of A and E, and also test other common letters.
 - We know the word has R in the middle, and includes A and E.

 Consider possible words. For example, words that have R in the second position.

 We also know that our guess must be a valid 5-letter word.

 Let's list some possibilities? But we don't need to list all; we need a word that includes A and E in different positions and avoids C and N, and also introduces new letters to gather more information.

 Common letters we haven't tested: we haven't used S, T, L, O, D, H, etc.

 We should aim to test A and E in new positions and cover unknown spots.

 How about placing A at position 1 or 4 or 5? And E at position 1, 3, or 4? But note: we can't put E at position 5? because we know it's not there (from feedback: dash for E at position 5 means E is present but not there).

 For our next guess, let's try to put A in a position that we don't know yet, and similarly for E.

 What positions are still unknown? All except position 2.

 We are going to test A at position 1? But then we can't test E at position 1? So maybe we put A at position 1 and E at position 3? Or A at position 4 and E at position 3? etc.

 But note: if we put A at position 1 and E at position 3, then the word would be: A R [E?] [new] [new]. However, we know that A cannot be at position 3? from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for A was dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So putting A at position 1 would be a valid test.

 Alternatively, to cover more ground, we might use a word that has A and E in the remaining possible positions and some new common letters.

 Top idea: use the word ""RADAR""? But that has two R's? We already have R fixed at position 2. Also, we are avoiding duplicate letters? Not necessarily, but we don't know. However, let's choose a word without duplicates to avoid complexity? But ""RADAR"" duplicates R and A? So not ideal.

 Another idea: word with second letter R and including A and E? Let's think.

 Possible words: 
 - ""ARISE"": this has A at position 1, R at position 2? That matches. Then I at position 3? But we don't know about I. Then S at 4, E at 5? But note: we had E at position 5 in the first guess and got dash? That means if the secret word has E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have gotten E as dash? Actually, no: we guessed crane -> E at position 5 was marked dash meaning E is present but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 in a new guess, that would be invalid? But wait: the secret word could have E at position 5? No, because the feedback for E was dash meaning it is in the word but not at that position (so not at 5). Hence, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word. Therefore, we shouldn't put E at position 5 in our guess if we want to test other possibilities? Actually, we can put E anywhere but we know now that in the secret word E is not at position 5.

 So in ""ARISE"":
   Position 1: A -> but we know A is in the word? Yes. And we know from first guess that A is not at position 3. Now we put it at position 1: if it becomes correct then we know A is at position 1, else if dash then it exists but we know it's not at position 1? This would help.
   Position 2: R -> we know it's correct so we'll get check mark no matter what? Actually, we already know it's correct so we must put R at position 2.
   Position 3: I -> new letter.
   Position 4: S -> new letter.
   Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at position 5? Because the feedback for the first guess said E is not at position 5. So putting E at position 5 in our guess: if the secret word had E at position 5, we would not have gotten the dash? So if we get a dash for E at position 5 again? It would be inconsistent? Actually, from the feedback of the first guess: the secret word has E, but not at position 5. So if we guess E at position 5 and we get a dash, it would confirm that the secret word does not have E at position 5 (which we already know) and if we get a cross? We would get a cross only if E is not present? but we know E is present? So if we put E at a position 5 and we get a dash, that wouldn't be possible? Because the dash means it is present but not here? But we know the secret word has E? So actually, if we put E at position 5 we should get either:
      - a cross: but that would contradict the first feedback? because the first feedback said we have E? So we cannot get a cross? 
      - a dash: meaning E is present but not at position 5? That is what we already know.

 But in fact, we know E is present? So if we put E at position 5, the feedback must be a dash? Because we know the secret word does have an E, and we're placing it at position 5? Then it must be that the secret word's E is not at position 5? So we'll get dash? And we learn nothing new? 

 Why test that? It wastes a slot. Therefore, we shouldn't put E at position 5 because we already know that position 5 is not E.

 Similarly, we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3? Then we must get a dash? But we already know it's not at position 3? So we would get dash? Then we learn nothing? 

 So we should put A and E at positions that we don't know? So for A: positions 1, 4, and 5 are possible? For E: positions 1, 3, and 4 are possible? But note: in one word we can test A at one of these and E at one of these? But also we need to test other letters.

 Since we have a known letter R at position 2, let's choose a word that:
 - Has R at position 2.
 - Places A at either position 1, 4, or 5 (we pick one we haven't eliminated).
 - Places E at either position 1, 3, or 4 (but avoiding positions where A is? unless same).

 We need to avoid the known bad positions? So don't put A at position 3? And don't put E at position 5? But that's automatic because we are going to put them elsewhere.

 To maximize information, let's put A at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we test two new letters? And we leave position 3 and 5 for new letters? 

 Example word: ""A R E S T"" -> ""AREST""? Not a word? 

 ""A R E A L""? ""AREAL"": valid word? But it has two A's? We don't want duplicates? We don't know the secret word has duplicates? So avoid?

 ""A R E S"" — wait position 4? Need letter for position 4? And position 5? The word would be ""AR?E?"".

 How about ""AROSE""?
   A at 1, R at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5? We've been told that E is not at position 5? Why guess it again? 

 Let me think: the secret word doesn't have E at position 5? So in ""AROSE"", we are putting E at position 5 which we know is incorrect? Then we will get a dash for E? That's redundant? And A is at position 1? That might be new.

 So let's avoid E at position 5. Then we must put E at position 1? But position 1 would be both A and E? No, we can choose only one? 

 We can put E at position 3? Then the word format: [E at position 3]? 

 Or we put E at position 4? Then we don't test position 5 for E? Because we know position 5 is not E? 

 So let me look for words that:
   Position 1: A? 
   Position 2: R (fixed)
   Position 3: E? Or E should be elsewhere? But E can't be at position 5? And if we put E at position 3, that would be testing a position that A was (but A at 3 was wrong)? It is valid? Actually, we have no feedback for position 3? We only know that A is not at position 3? But E might be at position 3? 

 So possible word: ""A R E E S""? Not? 

 Alternatively: put A at position 4? Then word structure: [?] R [?] A [?]

 And E at position 3? Then: [new1] R E A [new2]

 Example: word ""BREA?"": ""BREAD"" -> but E is at position 3? 
 But: ""BREAD"": 
   Position 1: B
   Position 2: R -> correct
   Position 3: E -> we put E at 3? 
   Position 4: A
   Position 5: D

 But note: we have A and E: A is at position 4? And E at position 3? This is good because we are testing A and E in new positions.

 And we avoid any known problem? Also, we are introducing B and D? Which are not tested? But we haven't been told anything about B and D? So we test them.

 Therefore, I suggest ""BREAD"".

 But let's see: 
 - We know R is correct at 2.
 - If A is in the word? We put A at position 4: if we get check mark? Then A is at 4? Else, if dash? Then A is not at 4? Then must be at position 1 or 5? 
 - Similarly, E at position 3: if we get check mark? Then E is at 3? Else, if dash? Then E is elsewhere? 
 - We also get feedback for B and D? 

 Alternatively, we might choose ""PARED"": 
   P at 1, A at 3? But wait, we know A is not at position 3? So we shouldn't put A at 3? Because it will definitely give a dash? Then not helpful? 

 So ""BREAD"" seems valid? Let me check if ""bread"" is a valid word? Yes? It's common.

 Another candidate: ""TRADE""? 
   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3? But wait: we know A is not at position 3? Therefore, if we put ""TRADE"": 
      Position 1: T
      Position 2: R -> ✓
      Position 3: A -> we should definitely get dash? Because we know A is not at 3? So if we get dash? We don't learn anything? 
      Position 4: D
      Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at 5? So we get dash? 

 Then we waste two positions: A at 3 (already known to be wrong) and E at 5 (already known wrong) -> inefficient? 

 Therefore, avoid placing A at any position we know it's not? And avoid E at any position we know it's not? 

 So ""TRADE"" is bad? 

 Let's choose ""BREAD"": 
   B at position 1: new? 
   R at 2: ✓
   E at 3: test this position? We don't know where E is? 
   A at 4: test? Because we don't know if A is at 4?
   D at 5: new? 

 Since we know E is not at 5? But we are putting D at 5? So that's okay? 

 This seems efficient? 

 However, note: we were told that A is in the word? So if A is at position 4? Then we'll get ✓ for A? 
 We were told that E is in the word? So if E is at position 3? Then we get ✓ for E? 

 But what if E is actually not at 3? Then we get dash for E? And we know E must be at positions 1 or 4? But position 4 is A? So then E could only be at position 1? Or position 4? But wait, if we are putting A at 4, then E cannot be at 4? So then E must be at position 1? Or if duplicates? We avoid duplicates? 

 So we are introducing new letters: B and D? 

 Let's consider: 
 - If E is not at position 3? Then after this guess we will see E at position 3 marked as dash? Then we know E must be somewhere else? And then we try position 1? Or we can deduce.

 Similarly, if A is not at position 4? Then we get dash? And we know A must be at position 1 or 5? 

 This guess will help us quickly pin down positions? 

 Therefore, I choose ""BREAD"" as the next guess.

 But wait: what about introducing more new common letters? We also have the option to use letters like S, T, L, etc? 

 In ""BREAD"": letters B, R, E, A, D? We already have R, E, A? And we add B and D? B is less common? We could use T, S, L, etc? 

 Alternatively, how about ""SUPER""? Not second letter R? 

 Or ""GRAVE""? 
   G at 1? 
   R at 2: ✓
   A at 3? But we know A is not at 3? -> so bad? 

 Or ""PARSE"": 
   P at 1, A at 3? again A at 3 -> bad? 

 So I stick with ""BREAD"".

 Another candidate: ""TRACE""? But C is blacklisted? We know C is not in the word? So we cannot use letters C? And also N is not? So avoid C and N? 

 Therefore, ""BREAD"" is valid? 

 Let me check: 
   We know C and N are not in the word? So we avoid B? Why B? Because it hasn't been tested? It's not forbidden? 

 We can also choose ""BRAKE""? 
   B at 1,
   R at 2 -> ✓,
   A at 3? Wait: we know A is not at 3? Then we must get dash? So we waste A? 
   K at 4? 
   E at 5? But E at 5: we know E is not at 5? So we must get dash? 
   So two dashes: the same as above? Only we test K? 

 Then we'd be equally? But ""BREAD"" tests two letters? 

 How about ""OPERA""? 
   O at 1? 
   P at 2? But position 2 must be R? So we must put R at position 2? 

 So we must have second letter R? So ""OPERA"" doesn't have R at position 2? 

 Hence, I'll go with ""BREAD"".

 Final decision: guess ""BREAD""

 But note: ""BREAD"" is the word? And we hope to get feedback that will clarify positions of A and E? 
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(-)), we know:
- **R** is in the correct position (position 2).
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3.
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5.
- **C** and **N** are absent.

For the next guess, we prioritize:
- Retaining **R** in position 2.
- Testing **A** and **E** in new possible positions (A not at 3, E not at 5).
- Introducing new common letters like **B** and **D** to gain additional information.

The word **""BREAD""** fits perfectly:
- B at position 1 (new letter test).
- R at position 2 (known correct).
- E at position 3 (tests if E is here).
- A at position 4 (tests if A is here).
- D at position 5 (new letter test).

This avoids redundant guesses and efficiently narrows possibilities for A, E, and new letters.

<guess>bread</guess>",bread,"We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(-)
 Interpretation:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since the word is 1-based: position 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E).
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed A at position 3, it must be elsewhere (either position 1, 4, or 5? but positions are fixed). Actually, A could be in positions 1, 4, or 5? Note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But A is not in position 3 because we got a dash (meaning wrong position). Also, we know position 2 is R (correct).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so not at position 5? because we placed it at position 5 and got dash). Similarly, E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4? But not position 2 because that is R (which is fixed).
 - C and N are not in the word at all.

 So what we know:
 - The second letter is R (position 2).
 - The word contains A and E, but not at the positions we guessed: 
      A is not at position 3 (because we got dash for wrong position), 
      E is not at position 5 (because we got dash).
 - The word does not contain C or N.

 Also, since A is in the word but not at position 3, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we must place them elsewhere.

 Possible positions for A: must be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But note: position 2 is taken by R, so A cannot be there. Similarly, for E: positions 1, 3, or 4? Because position 2 is R.

 However, we must also consider that the word has exactly 5 letters and we know one letter (R at position 2).

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]
 And we know:
 - letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5 are unknown.
 - The word includes A and E (each exactly once? but we don't know if there are duplicates). However, without more info, we assume unique unless proven otherwise.

 Also, we know that A is not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 4, or 5) and E is not at position 5 (so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4).

 Since C and N are out, we avoid those letters.

 We have two new letters to place: A and E.

 Strategy for the next guess:
 - We want to confirm the positions of A and E, and also test other common letters.
 - We know the word has R in the middle, and includes A and E.

 Consider possible words. For example, words that have R in the second position.

 We also know that our guess must be a valid 5-letter word.

 Let's list some possibilities? But we don't need to list all; we need a word that includes A and E in different positions and avoids C and N, and also introduces new letters to gather more information.

 Common letters we haven't tested: we haven't used S, T, L, O, D, H, etc.

 We should aim to test A and E in new positions and cover unknown spots.

 How about placing A at position 1 or 4 or 5? And E at position 1, 3, or 4? But note: we can't put E at position 5? because we know it's not there (from feedback: dash for E at position 5 means E is present but not there).

 For our next guess, let's try to put A in a position that we don't know yet, and similarly for E.

 What positions are still unknown? All except position 2.

 We are going to test A at position 1? But then we can't test E at position 1? So maybe we put A at position 1 and E at position 3? Or A at position 4 and E at position 3? etc.

 But note: if we put A at position 1 and E at position 3, then the word would be: A R [E?] [new] [new]. However, we know that A cannot be at position 3? from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for A was dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So putting A at position 1 would be a valid test.

 Alternatively, to cover more ground, we might use a word that has A and E in the remaining possible positions and some new common letters.

 Top idea: use the word ""RADAR""? But that has two R's? We already have R fixed at position 2. Also, we are avoiding duplicate letters? Not necessarily, but we don't know. However, let's choose a word without duplicates to avoid complexity? But ""RADAR"" duplicates R and A? So not ideal.

 Another idea: word with second letter R and including A and E? Let's think.

 Possible words: 
 - ""ARISE"": this has A at position 1, R at position 2? That matches. Then I at position 3? But we don't know about I. Then S at 4, E at 5? But note: we had E at position 5 in the first guess and got dash? That means if the secret word has E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have gotten E as dash? Actually, no: we guessed crane -> E at position 5 was marked dash meaning E is present but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 in a new guess, that would be invalid? But wait: the secret word could have E at position 5? No, because the feedback for E was dash meaning it is in the word but not at that position (so not at 5). Hence, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word. Therefore, we shouldn't put E at position 5 in our guess if we want to test other possibilities? Actually, we can put E anywhere but we know now that in the secret word E is not at position 5.

 So in ""ARISE"":
   Position 1: A -> but we know A is in the word? Yes. And we know from first guess that A is not at position 3. Now we put it at position 1: if it becomes correct then we know A is at position 1, else if dash then it exists but we know it's not at position 1? This would help.
   Position 2: R -> we know it's correct so we'll get check mark no matter what? Actually, we already know it's correct so we must put R at position 2.
   Position 3: I -> new letter.
   Position 4: S -> new letter.
   Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at position 5? Because the feedback for the first guess said E is not at position 5. So putting E at position 5 in our guess: if the secret word had E at position 5, we would not have gotten the dash? So if we get a dash for E at position 5 again? It would be inconsistent? Actually, from the feedback of the first guess: the secret word has E, but not at position 5. So if we guess E at position 5 and we get a dash, it would confirm that the secret word does not have E at position 5 (which we already know) and if we get a cross? We would get a cross only if E is not present? but we know E is present? So if we put E at a position 5 and we get a dash, that wouldn't be possible? Because the dash means it is present but not here? But we know the secret word has E? So actually, if we put E at position 5 we should get either:
      - a cross: but that would contradict the first feedback? because the first feedback said we have E? So we cannot get a cross? 
      - a dash: meaning E is present but not at position 5? That is what we already know.

 But in fact, we know E is present? So if we put E at position 5, the feedback must be a dash? Because we know the secret word does have an E, and we're placing it at position 5? Then it must be that the secret word's E is not at position 5? So we'll get dash? And we learn nothing new? 

 Why test that? It wastes a slot. Therefore, we shouldn't put E at position 5 because we already know that position 5 is not E.

 Similarly, we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3? Then we must get a dash? But we already know it's not at position 3? So we would get dash? Then we learn nothing? 

 So we should put A and E at positions that we don't know? So for A: positions 1, 4, and 5 are possible? For E: positions 1, 3, and 4 are possible? But note: in one word we can test A at one of these and E at one of these? But also we need to test other letters.

 Since we have a known letter R at position 2, let's choose a word that:
 - Has R at position 2.
 - Places A at either position 1, 4, or 5 (we pick one we haven't eliminated).
 - Places E at either position 1, 3, or 4 (but avoiding positions where A is? unless same).

 We need to avoid the known bad positions? So don't put A at position 3? And don't put E at position 5? But that's automatic because we are going to put them elsewhere.

 To maximize information, let's put A at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we test two new letters? And we leave position 3 and 5 for new letters? 

 Example word: ""A R E S T"" -> ""AREST""? Not a word? 

 ""A R E A L""? ""AREAL"": valid word? But it has two A's? We don't want duplicates? We don't know the secret word has duplicates? So avoid?

 ""A R E S"" — wait position 4? Need letter for position 4? And position 5? The word would be ""AR?E?"".

 How about ""AROSE""?
   A at 1, R at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5? We've been told that E is not at position 5? Why guess it again? 

 Let me think: the secret word doesn't have E at position 5? So in ""AROSE"", we are putting E at position 5 which we know is incorrect? Then we will get a dash for E? That's redundant? And A is at position 1? That might be new.

 So let's avoid E at position 5. Then we must put E at position 1? But position 1 would be both A and E? No, we can choose only one? 

 We can put E at position 3? Then the word format: [E at position 3]? 

 Or we put E at position 4? Then we don't test position 5 for E? Because we know position 5 is not E? 

 So let me look for words that:
   Position 1: A? 
   Position 2: R (fixed)
   Position 3: E? Or E should be elsewhere? But E can't be at position 5? And if we put E at position 3, that would be testing a position that A was (but A at 3 was wrong)? It is valid? Actually, we have no feedback for position 3? We only know that A is not at position 3? But E might be at position 3? 

 So possible word: ""A R E E S""? Not? 

 Alternatively: put A at position 4? Then word structure: [?] R [?] A [?]

 And E at position 3? Then: [new1] R E A [new2]

 Example: word ""BREA?"": ""BREAD"" -> but E is at position 3? 
 But: ""BREAD"": 
   Position 1: B
   Position 2: R -> correct
   Position 3: E -> we put E at 3? 
   Position 4: A
   Position 5: D

 But note: we have A and E: A is at position 4? And E at position 3? This is good because we are testing A and E in new positions.

 And we avoid any known problem? Also, we are introducing B and D? Which are not tested? But we haven't been told anything about B and D? So we test them.

 Therefore, I suggest ""BREAD"".

 But let's see: 
 - We know R is correct at 2.
 - If A is in the word? We put A at position 4: if we get check mark? Then A is at 4? Else, if dash? Then A is not at 4? Then must be at position 1 or 5? 
 - Similarly, E at position 3: if we get check mark? Then E is at 3? Else, if dash? Then E is elsewhere? 
 - We also get feedback for B and D? 

 Alternatively, we might choose ""PARED"": 
   P at 1, A at 3? But wait, we know A is not at position 3? So we shouldn't put A at 3? Because it will definitely give a dash? Then not helpful? 

 So ""BREAD"" seems valid? Let me check if ""bread"" is a valid word? Yes? It's common.

 Another candidate: ""TRADE""? 
   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3? But wait: we know A is not at position 3? Therefore, if we put ""TRADE"": 
      Position 1: T
      Position 2: R -> ✓
      Position 3: A -> we should definitely get dash? Because we know A is not at 3? So if we get dash? We don't learn anything? 
      Position 4: D
      Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at 5? So we get dash? 

 Then we waste two positions: A at 3 (already known to be wrong) and E at 5 (already known wrong) -> inefficient? 

 Therefore, avoid placing A at any position we know it's not? And avoid E at any position we know it's not? 

 So ""TRADE"" is bad? 

 Let's choose ""BREAD"": 
   B at position 1: new? 
   R at 2: ✓
   E at 3: test this position? We don't know where E is? 
   A at 4: test? Because we don't know if A is at 4?
   D at 5: new? 

 Since we know E is not at 5? But we are putting D at 5? So that's okay? 

 This seems efficient? 

 However, note: we were told that A is in the word? So if A is at position 4? Then we'll get ✓ for A? 
 We were told that E is in the word? So if E is at position 3? Then we get ✓ for E? 

 But what if E is actually not at 3? Then we get dash for E? And we know E must be at positions 1 or 4? But position 4 is A? So then E could only be at position 1? Or position 4? But wait, if we are putting A at 4, then E cannot be at 4? So then E must be at position 1? Or if duplicates? We avoid duplicates? 

 So we are introducing new letters: B and D? 

 Let's consider: 
 - If E is not at position 3? Then after this guess we will see E at position 3 marked as dash? Then we know E must be somewhere else? And then we try position 1? Or we can deduce.

 Similarly, if A is not at position 4? Then we get dash? And we know A must be at position 1 or 5? 

 This guess will help us quickly pin down positions? 

 Therefore, I choose ""BREAD"" as the next guess.

 But wait: what about introducing more new common letters? We also have the option to use letters like S, T, L, etc? 

 In ""BREAD"": letters B, R, E, A, D? We already have R, E, A? And we add B and D? B is less common? We could use T, S, L, etc? 

 Alternatively, how about ""SUPER""? Not second letter R? 

 Or ""GRAVE""? 
   G at 1? 
   R at 2: ✓
   A at 3? But we know A is not at 3? -> so bad? 

 Or ""PARSE"": 
   P at 1, A at 3? again A at 3 -> bad? 

 So I stick with ""BREAD"".

 Another candidate: ""TRACE""? But C is blacklisted? We know C is not in the word? So we cannot use letters C? And also N is not? So avoid C and N? 

 Therefore, ""BREAD"" is valid? 

 Let me check: 
   We know C and N are not in the word? So we avoid B? Why B? Because it hasn't been tested? It's not forbidden? 

 We can also choose ""BRAKE""? 
   B at 1,
   R at 2 -> ✓,
   A at 3? Wait: we know A is not at 3? Then we must get dash? So we waste A? 
   K at 4? 
   E at 5? But E at 5: we know E is not at 5? So we must get dash? 
   So two dashes: the same as above? Only we test K? 

 Then we'd be equally? But ""BREAD"" tests two letters? 

 How about ""OPERA""? 
   O at 1? 
   P at 2? But position 2 must be R? So we must put R at position 2? 

 So we must have second letter R? So ""OPERA"" doesn't have R at position 2? 

 Hence, I'll go with ""BREAD"".

 Final decision: guess ""BREAD""

 But note: ""BREAD"" is the word? And we hope to get feedback that will clarify positions of A and E?Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(-)), we know:
- **R** is in the correct position (position 2).
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3.
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5.
- **C** and **N** are absent.

For the next guess, we prioritize:
- Retaining **R** in position 2.
- Testing **A** and **E** in new possible positions (A not at 3, E not at 5).
- Introducing new common letters like **B** and **D** to gain additional information.

The word **""BREAD""** fits perfectly:
- B at position 1 (new letter test).
- R at position 2 (known correct).
- E at position 3 (tests if E is here).
- A at position 4 (tests if A is here).
- D at position 5 (new letter test).

This avoids redundant guesses and efficiently narrows possibilities for A, E, and new letters.",Guess 2: bread -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) E(✓) A(✓) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,FREAK,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we need a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common letters in English include vowels (A,E,I,O,U) and frequent consonants (R,S,T,L,N, etc.).
 Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", etc. We'll choose one that balances common letters and frequency.

 Let's choose ""ROATE"". Why?
 - It has relatively common letters: R, O, A, T, E.
 - It contains three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T).

 However, note that the rules require 5-letter English words. ""ROATE"" is a valid word (it is a financial term meaning the profit from an investment).

 We'll go with ""ROATE"".

 If the user says we cannot use this word, we might pick another, but for now, let's use it.

 Thus, our first guess: ROATE.For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover frequent letters. After considering options, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- C, R, A, N, and E are all highly frequent in English words.
- This combination helps test multiple letter positions broadly.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(-)
 Interpretation:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since the word is 1-based: position 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E).
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed A at position 3, it must be elsewhere (either position 1, 4, or 5? but positions are fixed). Actually, A could be in positions 1, 4, or 5? Note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But A is not in position 3 because we got a dash (meaning wrong position). Also, we know position 2 is R (correct).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so not at position 5? because we placed it at position 5 and got dash). Similarly, E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4? But not position 2 because that is R (which is fixed).
 - C and N are not in the word at all.

 So what we know:
 - The second letter is R (position 2).
 - The word contains A and E, but not at the positions we guessed: 
      A is not at position 3 (because we got dash for wrong position), 
      E is not at position 5 (because we got dash).
 - The word does not contain C or N.

 Also, since A is in the word but not at position 3, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we must place them elsewhere.

 Possible positions for A: must be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But note: position 2 is taken by R, so A cannot be there. Similarly, for E: positions 1, 3, or 4? Because position 2 is R.

 However, we must also consider that the word has exactly 5 letters and we know one letter (R at position 2).

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]
 And we know:
 - letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5 are unknown.
 - The word includes A and E (each exactly once? but we don't know if there are duplicates). However, without more info, we assume unique unless proven otherwise.

 Also, we know that A is not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 4, or 5) and E is not at position 5 (so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4).

 Since C and N are out, we avoid those letters.

 We have two new letters to place: A and E.

 Strategy for the next guess:
 - We want to confirm the positions of A and E, and also test other common letters.
 - We know the word has R in the middle, and includes A and E.

 Consider possible words. For example, words that have R in the second position.

 We also know that our guess must be a valid 5-letter word.

 Let's list some possibilities? But we don't need to list all; we need a word that includes A and E in different positions and avoids C and N, and also introduces new letters to gather more information.

 Common letters we haven't tested: we haven't used S, T, L, O, D, H, etc.

 We should aim to test A and E in new positions and cover unknown spots.

 How about placing A at position 1 or 4 or 5? And E at position 1, 3, or 4? But note: we can't put E at position 5? because we know it's not there (from feedback: dash for E at position 5 means E is present but not there).

 For our next guess, let's try to put A in a position that we don't know yet, and similarly for E.

 What positions are still unknown? All except position 2.

 We are going to test A at position 1? But then we can't test E at position 1? So maybe we put A at position 1 and E at position 3? Or A at position 4 and E at position 3? etc.

 But note: if we put A at position 1 and E at position 3, then the word would be: A R [E?] [new] [new]. However, we know that A cannot be at position 3? from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for A was dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So putting A at position 1 would be a valid test.

 Alternatively, to cover more ground, we might use a word that has A and E in the remaining possible positions and some new common letters.

 Top idea: use the word ""RADAR""? But that has two R's? We already have R fixed at position 2. Also, we are avoiding duplicate letters? Not necessarily, but we don't know. However, let's choose a word without duplicates to avoid complexity? But ""RADAR"" duplicates R and A? So not ideal.

 - ""ARISE"": this has A at position 1, R at position 2? That matches. Then I at position 3? But we don't know about I. Then S at 4, E at 5? But note: we had E at position 5 in the first guess and got dash? That means if the secret word has E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have gotten E as dash?

But wait: the secret word could have E at position 5? No, because the feedback for E was dash meaning it is in the word but not at that position (so not at 5). Hence, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word. Therefore, we shouldn't put E at position 5 in our guess if we want to test other possibilities? Actually, we can put E anywhere but we know now that in the secret word E is not at position 5.

 So in ""ARISE"":
   Position 1: A -> but we know A is in the word? Yes. And we know from first guess that A is not at position 3. Now we put it at position 1: if it becomes correct then we know A is at position 1, else if dash then it exists but we know it's not at position 1? This would help.
   Position 2: R -> we know it's correct so we'll get check mark no matter what? Actually, we already know it's correct so we must put R at position 2.
   Position 3: I -> new letter.
   Position 4: S -> new letter.
   Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at position 5? Because the feedback for the first guess said E is not at position 5. So putting E at position 5 in our guess: if the secret word had E at position 5, we would not have gotten the dash? So if we get a dash for E at position 5 again? It would be inconsistent? Actually, from the feedback of the first guess: the secret word has E, but not at position 5. So if we guess E at position 5 and we get a dash, it would confirm that the secret word does not have E at position 5 (which we already know) and if we get a cross? We would get a cross only if E is not present? but we know E is present? So if we put E at a position 5 and we get a dash, that wouldn't be possible? Because the dash means it is present but not here? But we know the secret word has E? So actually, if we put E at position 5 we should get either:
      - a cross: but that would contradict the first feedback? because the first feedback said we have E? So we cannot get a cross? 
      - a dash: meaning E is present but not at position 5? That is what we already know.

 But in fact, we know E is present? So if we put E at position 5, the feedback must be a dash? Because we know the secret word does have an E, and we're placing it at position 5? Then it must be that the secret word's E is not at position 5? So we'll get dash? And we learn nothing new? 

 Why test that? It wastes a slot. Therefore, we shouldn't put E at position 5 because we already know that position 5 is not E.

 Similarly, we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3? Then we must get a dash? But we already know it's not at position 3? So we would get dash? Then we learn nothing? 

 So we should put A and E at positions that we don't know? So for A: positions 1, 4, and 5 are possible? For E: positions 1, 3, and 4 are possible? But note: in one word we can test A at one of these and E at one of these? But also we need to test other letters.

 Since we have a known letter R at position 2, let's choose a word that:
 - Has R at position 2.
 - Places A at either position 1, 4, or 5 (we pick one we haven't eliminated).
 - Places E at either position 1, 3, or 4 (but avoiding positions where A is? unless same).

 We need to avoid the known bad positions? So don't put A at position 3? And don't put E at position 5? But that's automatic because we are going to put them elsewhere.

 To maximize information, let's put A at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we test two new letters? And we leave position 3 and 5 for new letters? 

 Example word: ""A R E S T"" -> ""AREST""? Not a word? 

 ""A R E A L""? ""AREAL"": valid word? But it has two A's? We don't want duplicates? We don't know the secret word has duplicates? So avoid?

 ""A R E S"" — wait position 4? Need letter for position 4? And position 5? The word would be ""AR?E?"".

 How about ""AROSE""?
   A at 1, R at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5? We've been told that E is not at position 5? Why guess it again? 

 Let me think: the secret word doesn't have E at position 5? So in ""AROSE"", we are putting E at position 5 which we know is incorrect? Then we will get a dash for E? That's redundant? And A is at position 1? That might be new.

 So let's avoid E at position 5. Then we must put E at position 1? But position 1 would be both A and E? No, we can choose only one? 

 We can put E at position 3? Then the word format: [E at position 3]? 

 Or we put E at position 4? Then we don't test position 5 for E? Because we know position 5 is not E? 

 So let me look for words that:
   Position 1: A? 
   Position 2: R (fixed)
   Position 3: E? Or E should be elsewhere? But E can't be at position 5? And if we put E at position 3, that would be testing a position that A was (but A at 3 was wrong)? It is valid? Actually, we have no feedback for position 3? We only know that A is not at position 3? But E might be at position 3? 

 So possible word: ""A R E E S""? Not? 

 Alternatively: put A at position 4? Then word structure: [?] R [?] A [?]

 And E at position 3? Then: [new1] R E A [new2]

 Example: word ""BREA?"": ""BREAD"" -> but E is at position 3? 
 But: ""BREAD"": 
   Position 1: B
   Position 2: R -> correct
   Position 3: E -> we put E at 3? 
   Position 4: A
   Position 5: D

 But note: we have A and E: A is at position 4? And E at position 3? This is good because we are testing A and E in new positions.

 And we avoid any known problem? Also, we are introducing B and D? Which are not tested? But we haven't been told anything about B and D? So we test them.

 Therefore, I suggest ""BREAD"".

 But let's see: 
 - We know R is correct at 2.
 - If A is in the word? We put A at position 4: if we get check mark? Then A is at 4? Else, if dash? Then A is not at 4? Then must be at position 1 or 5? 
 - Similarly, E at position 3: if we get check mark? Then E is at 3? Else, if dash? Then E is elsewhere? 
 - We also get feedback for B and D? 

 Alternatively, we might choose ""PARED"": 
   P at 1, A at 3? But wait, we know A is not at position 3? So we shouldn't put A at 3? Because it will definitely give a dash? Then not helpful? 

 So ""BREAD"" seems valid? Let me check if ""bread"" is a valid word? Yes? It's common.

 Another candidate: ""TRADE""? 
   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3? But wait: we know A is not at position 3? Therefore, if we put ""TRADE"": 
      Position 1: T
      Position 2: R -> ✓
      Position 3: A -> we should definitely get dash? Because we know A is not at 3? So if we get dash? We don't learn anything? 
      Position 4: D
      Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at 5? So we get dash? 

 Then we waste two positions: A at 3 (already known to be wrong) and E at 5 (already known wrong) -> inefficient? 

 Therefore, avoid placing A at any position we know it's not? And avoid E at any position we know it's not? 

 So ""TRADE"" is bad? 

 Let's choose ""BREAD"": 
   B at position 1: new? 
   R at 2: ✓
   E at 3: test this position? We don't know where E is? 
   A at 4: test? Because we don't know if A is at 4?
   D at 5: new? 

 Since we know E is not at 5? But we are putting D at 5? So that's okay? 

 This seems efficient? 

 However, note: we were told that A is in the word? So if A is at position 4? Then we'll get ✓ for A? 
 We were told that E is in the word? So if E is at position 3? Then we get ✓ for E? 

 But what if E is actually not at 3? Then we get dash for E? And we know E must be at positions 1 or 4? But position 4 is A? So then E could only be at position 1? Or position 4? But wait, if we are putting A at 4, then E cannot be at 4? So then E must be at position 1? Or if duplicates? We avoid duplicates? 

 So we are introducing new letters: B and D? 

 Let's consider: 
 - If E is not at position 3? Then after this guess we will see E at position 3 marked as dash? Then we know E must be somewhere else? And then we try position 1? Or we can deduce.

 Similarly, if A is not at position 4? Then we get dash? And we know A must be at position 1 or 5? 

 This guess will help us quickly pin down positions? 

 Therefore, I choose ""BREAD"" as the next guess.

 But wait: what about introducing more new common letters? We also have the option to use letters like S, T, L, etc? 

 In ""BREAD"": letters B, R, E, A, D? We already have R, E, A? And we add B and D? B is less common? We could use T, S, L, etc? 

 Alternatively, how about ""SUPER""? Not second letter R? 

 Or ""GRAVE""? 
   G at 1? 
   R at 2: ✓
   A at 3? But we know A is not at 3? -> so bad? 

 Or ""PARSE"": 
   P at 1, A at 3? again A at 3 -> bad? 

 So I stick with ""BREAD"".

 Another candidate: ""TRACE""? But C is blacklisted? We know C is not in the word? So we cannot use letters C? And also N is not? So avoid C and N? 

 Therefore, ""BREAD"" is valid? 

 Let me check: 
   We know C and N are not in the word? So we avoid B? Why B? Because it hasn't been tested? It's not forbidden? 

 We can also choose ""BRAKE""? 
   B at 1,
   R at 2 -> ✓,
   A at 3? Wait: we know A is not at 3? Then we must get dash? So we waste A? 
   K at 4? 
   E at 5? But E at 5: we know E is not at 5? So we must get dash? 
   So two dashes: the same as above? Only we test K? 

 Then we'd be equally? But ""BREAD"" tests two letters? 

 How about ""OPERA""? 
   O at 1? 
   P at 2? But position 2 must be R? So we must put R at position 2? 

 So we must have second letter R? So ""OPERA"" doesn't have R at position 2? 

 Hence, I'll go with ""BREAD"".

 Final decision: guess ""BREAD""

 But note: ""BREAD"" is the word? And we hope to get feedback that will clarify positions of A and E?Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(-)), we know:
- **R** is in the correct position (position 2).
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3.
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5.
- **C** and **N** are absent.

For the next guess, we prioritize:
- Retaining **R** in position 2.
- Testing **A** and **E** in new possible positions (A not at 3, E not at 5).
- Introducing new common letters like **B** and **D** to gain additional information.

The word **""BREAD""** fits perfectly:
- B at position 1 (new letter test).
- R at position 2 (known correct).
- E at position 3 (tests if E is here).
- A at position 4 (tests if A is here).
- D at position 5 (new letter test).

This avoids redundant guesses and efficiently narrows possibilities for A, E, and new letters.

After considering options, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:\n- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).\n- C, R, A, N, and E are all highly frequent in English words.\n- This combination helps test multiple letter positions broadly.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(-)\n Interpretation:\n - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since the word is 1-based: position 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E).\n - A is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed A at position 3, it must be elsewhere (either position 1, 4, or 5? but positions are fixed). Actually, A could be in positions 1, 4, or 5? Note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But A is not in position 3 because we got a dash (meaning wrong position). Also, we know position 2 is R (correct).\n - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so not at position 5? because we placed it at position 5 and got dash). Similarly, E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4? But not position 2 because that is R (which is fixed).\n - C and N are not in the word at all.\n\n So what we know:\n - The second letter is R (position 2).\n - The word contains A and E, but not at the positions we guessed: \n      A is not at position 3 (because we got dash for wrong position), \n      E is not at position 5 (because we got dash).\n - The word does not contain C or N.\n\n Also, since A is in the word but not at position 3, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we must place them elsewhere.\n\n Possible positions for A: must be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But note: position 2 is taken by R, so A cannot be there. Similarly, for E: positions 1, 3, or 4? Because position 2 is R.\n\n However, we must also consider that the word has exactly 5 letters and we know one letter (R at position 2).\n\n Therefore, the secret word has the form: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n And we know:\n - letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5 are unknown.\n - The word includes A and E (each exactly once? but we don\'t know if there are duplicates). However, without more info, we assume unique unless proven otherwise.\n\n Also, we know that A is not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 4, or 5) and E is not at position 5 (so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4).\n\n Since C and N are out, we avoid those letters.\n\n We have two new letters to place: A and E.\n\n Strategy for the next guess:\n - We want to confirm the positions of A and E, and also test other common letters.\n - We know the word has R in the middle, and includes A and E.\n\n Consider possible words. For example, words that have R in the second position.\n\n We also know that our guess must be a valid 5-letter word.\n\n Let\'s list some possibilities? But we don\'t need to list all; we need a word that includes A and E in different positions and avoids C and N, and also introduces new letters to gather more information.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tested: we haven\'t used S, T, L, O, D, H, etc.\n\n We should aim to test A and E in new positions and cover unknown spots.\n\n How about placing A at position 1 or 4 or 5? And E at position 1, 3, or 4? But note: we can\'t put E at position 5? because we know it\'s not there (from feedback: dash for E at position 5 means E is present but not there).\n\n For our next guess, let\'s try to put A in a position that we don\'t know yet, and similarly for E.\n\n What positions are still unknown? All except position 2.\n\n We are going to test A at position 1? But then we can\'t test E at position 1? So maybe we put A at position 1 and E at position 3? Or A at position 4 and E at position 3? etc.\n\n But note: if we put A at position 1 and E at position 3, then the word would be: A R [E?] [new] [new]. However, we know that A cannot be at position 3? from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for A was dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So putting A at position 1 would be a valid test.\n\n Alternatively, to cover more ground, we might use a word that has A and E in the remaining possible positions and some new common letters.\n\n Top idea: use the word ""RADAR""? But that has two R\'s? We already have R fixed at position 2. Also, we are avoiding duplicate letters? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know. However, let\'s choose a word without duplicates to avoid complexity? But ""RADAR"" duplicates R and A? So not ideal.\n\n Another idea: word with second letter R and including A and E? Let\'s think.\n\n Possible words: \n - ""ARISE"": this has A at position 1, R at position 2? That matches. Then I at position 3? But we don\'t know about I. Then S at 4, E at 5? But note: we had E at position 5 in the first guess and got dash? That means if the secret word has E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have gotten E as dash? Actually, no: we guessed crane -> E at position 5 was marked dash meaning E is present but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 in a new guess, that would be invalid? But wait: the secret word could have E at position 5? No, because the feedback for E was dash meaning it is in the word but not at that position (so not at 5). Hence, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word. Therefore, we shouldn\'t put E at position 5 in our guess if we want to test other possibilities? Actually, we can put E anywhere but we know now that in the secret word E is not at position 5.\n\n So in ""ARISE"":\n   Position 1: A -> but we know A is in the word? Yes. And we know from first guess that A is not at position 3. Now we put it at position 1: if it becomes correct then we know A is at position 1, else if dash then it exists but we know it\'s not at position 1? This would help.\n   Position 2: R -> we know it\'s correct so we\'ll get check mark no matter what? Actually, we already know it\'s correct so we must put R at position 2.\n   Position 3: I -> new letter.\n   Position 4: S -> new letter.\n   Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at position 5? Because the feedback for the first guess said E is not at position 5. So putting E at position 5 in our guess: if the secret word had E at position 5, we would not have gotten the dash? So if we get a dash for E at position 5 again? It would be inconsistent? Actually, from the feedback of the first guess: the secret word has E, but not at position 5. So if we guess E at position 5 and we get a dash, it would confirm that the secret word does not have E at position 5 (which we already know) and if we get a cross? We would get a cross only if E is not present? but we know E is present? So if we put E at a position 5 and we get a dash, that wouldn\'t be possible? Because the dash means it is present but not here? But we know the secret word has E? So actually, if we put E at position 5 we should get either:\n      - a cross: but that would contradict the first feedback? because the first feedback said we have E? So we cannot get a cross? \n      - a dash: meaning E is present but not at position 5? That is what we already know.\n\n But in fact, we know E is present? So if we put E at position 5, the feedback must be a dash? Because we know the secret word does have an E, and we\'re placing it at position 5? Then it must be that the secret word\'s E is not at position 5? So we\'ll get dash? And we learn nothing new? \n\n Why test that? It wastes a slot. Therefore, we shouldn\'t put E at position 5 because we already know that position 5 is not E.\n\n Similarly, we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3? Then we must get a dash? But we already know it\'s not at position 3? So we would get dash? Then we learn nothing? \n\n So we should put A and E at positions that we don\'t know? So for A: positions 1, 4, and 5 are possible? For E: positions 1, 3, and 4 are possible? But note: in one word we can test A at one of these and E at one of these? But also we need to test other letters.\n\n Since we have a known letter R at position 2, let\'s choose a word that:\n - Has R at position 2.\n - Places A at either position 1, 4, or 5 (we pick one we haven\'t eliminated).\n - Places E at either position 1, 3, or 4 (but avoiding positions where A is? unless same).\n\n We need to avoid the known bad positions? So don\'t put A at position 3? And don\'t put E at position 5? But that\'s automatic because we are going to put them elsewhere.\n\n To maximize information, let\'s put A at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we test two new letters? And we leave position 3 and 5 for new letters? \n\n Example word: ""A R E S T"" -> ""AREST""? Not a word? \n\n ""A R E A L""? ""AREAL"": valid word? But it has two A\'s? We don\'t want duplicates? We don\'t know the secret word has duplicates? So avoid?\n\n ""A R E S"" — wait position 4? Need letter for position 4? And position 5? The word would be ""AR?E?"".\n\n How about ""AROSE""?\n   A at 1, R at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5? We\'ve been told that E is not at position 5? Why guess it again? \n\n Let me think: the secret word doesn\'t have E at position 5? So in ""AROSE"", we are putting E at position 5 which we know is incorrect? Then we will get a dash for E? That\'s redundant? And A is at position 1? That might be new.\n\n So let\'s avoid E at position 5. Then we must put E at position 1? But position 1 would be both A and E? No, we can choose only one? \n\n We can put E at position 3? Then the word format: [E at position 3]? \n\n Or we put E at position 4? Then we don\'t test position 5 for E? Because we know position 5 is not E? \n\n So let me look for words that:\n   Position 1: A? \n   Position 2: R (fixed)\n   Position 3: E? Or E should be elsewhere? But E can\'t be at position 5? And if we put E at position 3, that would be testing a position that A was (but A at 3 was wrong)? It is valid? Actually, we have no feedback for position 3? We only know that A is not at position 3? But E might be at position 3? \n\n So possible word: ""A R E E S""? Not? \n\n Alternatively: put A at position 4? Then word structure: [?] R [?] A [?]\n\n And E at position 3? Then: [new1] R E A [new2]\n\n Example: word ""BREA?"": ""BREAD"" -> but E is at position 3? \n But: ""BREAD"": \n   Position 1: B\n   Position 2: R -> correct\n   Position 3: E -> we put E at 3? \n   Position 4: A\n   Position 5: D\n\n But note: we have A and E: A is at position 4? And E at position 3? This is good because we are testing A and E in new positions.\n\n And we avoid any known problem? Also, we are introducing B and D? Which are not tested? But we haven\'t been told anything about B and D? So we test them.\n\n Therefore, I suggest ""BREAD"".\n\n But let\'s see: \n - We know R is correct at 2.\n - If A is in the word? We put A at position 4: if we get check mark? Then A is at 4? Else, if dash? Then A is not at 4? Then must be at position 1 or 5? \n - Similarly, E at position 3: if we get check mark? Then E is at 3? Else, if dash? Then E is elsewhere? \n - We also get feedback for B and D? \n\n Alternatively, we might choose ""PARED"": \n   P at 1, A at 3? But wait, we know A is not at position 3? So we shouldn\'t put A at 3? Because it will definitely give a dash? Then not helpful? \n\n So ""BREAD"" seems valid? Let me check if ""bread"" is a valid word? Yes? It\'s common.\n\n Another candidate: ""TRADE""? \n   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3? But wait: we know A is not at position 3? Therefore, if we put ""TRADE"": \n      Position 1: T\n      Position 2: R -> ✓\n      Position 3: A -> we should definitely get dash? Because we know A is not at 3? So if we get dash? We don\'t learn anything? \n      Position 4: D\n      Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at 5? So we get dash? \n\n Then we waste two positions: A at 3 (already known to be wrong) and E at 5 (already known wrong) -> inefficient? \n\n Therefore, avoid placing A at any position we know it\'s not? And avoid E at any position we know it\'s not? \n\n So ""TRADE"" is bad? \n\n Let\'s choose ""BREAD"": \n   B at position 1: new? \n   R at 2: ✓\n   E at 3: test this position? We don\'t know where E is? \n   A at 4: test? Because we don\'t know if A is at 4?\n   D at 5: new? \n\n Since we know E is not at 5? But we are putting D at 5? So that\'s okay? \n\n This seems efficient? \n\n However, note: we were told that A is in the word? So if A is at position 4? Then we\'ll get ✓ for A? \n We were told that E is in the word? So if E is at position 3? Then we get ✓ for E? \n\n But what if E is actually not at 3? Then we get dash for E? And we know E must be at positions 1 or 4? But position 4 is A? So then E could only be at position 1? Or position 4? But wait, if we are putting A at 4, then E cannot be at 4? So then E must be at position 1? Or if duplicates? We avoid duplicates? \n\n So we are introducing new letters: B and D? \n\n Let\'s consider: \n - If E is not at position 3? Then after this guess we will see E at position 3 marked as dash?

- From the first guess, A was not at position 3 (which is consistent because now we know it's at 4) and E was not at position 5 (which is consistent because we now know E is at 3, not 5).
- The secret word has the form: [letter1] R E A [letter5]

We also know that C, N, B, and D are absent (from the x's).

We need to find the first and fifth letters.

Constraints:
- The first letter cannot be C, N, B, or D (since they are absent).
- The fifth letter cannot be C, N, B, D, or E (because E is at position 3, and we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5, which is consistent). Also, note that E is already placed at 3, so it can't be at 5.

Additionally, we know from the first guess that the word contains A and E (which we've placed) and R (placed). But are there any other letters? The first guess had five letters: C, R, A, N, E. We know C and N are absent, so the only letters present were R, A, E. Similarly, the second guess had B, R, E, A, D. We know B and D are absent, so again, only R, E, A are present? But wait, the secret word has five letters. We have three letters: R, E, A. So we are missing two: one at position 1 and one at position 5.

But note: the feedback from the first guess said that A and E are present (but in wrong positions) and R is correct. It didn't say anything about other letters? Actually, the first guess had five letters, and we got:
- C: absent
- R: correct
- A: present (but wrong position)
- N: absent
- E: present (but wrong position)

So the secret word must contain R, A, E, and two other letters that are not C or N. Similarly, the second guess: B and D are absent, so the secret word does not contain B or D.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: a letter that is not C, N, B, D, and not R, A, E (since those are already placed? but R, A, E are at positions 2,4,3, so they could be duplicated? But we don't know. However, the feedback from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", we had A and E marked as present, but if there were duplicates, we might not have seen it? The standard Wordle rules: if a letter is duplicated in the guess but not in the secret, it might show as absent for the extra ones. But in this case, we don't have duplicates in the guesses.

To be safe, we should not assume duplicates unless necessary. Since we have three confirmed letters (R, E, A) and two positions to fill, and the word has five letters, it's possible that there are duplicates? But we haven't seen any indication of duplicates so far.

Given the feedback, let's see if duplicates are possible:

- In the first guess, we had one A and one E, and both were marked as present (but wrong positions). If the secret had two A's, for example, then if we guessed one A in the wrong position, it would still show as present. Similarly for E. But we don't have evidence for duplicates.

Moreover, in the second guess, we had one E and one A, and they were both marked correct at positions 3 and 4. If the secret had duplicates, then if we guessed only one, we might not see the duplicate? But we don't know.

However, without evidence, it's simpler to assume no duplicates for now.

So, the secret word has exactly the letters: R, E, A, and two other letters (say X and Y) at positions 1 and 5.

We know that X (position 1) and Y (position 5) are not C, N, B, D.

Also, they cannot be R, E, A? Because if they were, then we would have duplicates? But we don't know. Let's not rule out duplicates entirely.

But note: if position 1 were R, that would be duplicate R? But we have R at position 2. Similarly, if position 1 were E, but we have E at position 3? Or position 5 were A? But we have A at position 4.

But in the feedback for the second guess, we have:
- B: absent -> so no B
- R: correct at 2 -> so R is at 2, and if there were another R, it might be at position 1 or 5? But we don't know.

Similarly, for E: we have E at 3, so if there were another E, it could be at 1 or 5? But the first guess had E at 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position? That would be consistent with E being at 3 and also at 5? But wait, the first guess had E at position 5, and we got a dash, meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So if the secret word had two E's, one at 3 and one at 5, then when we guessed E at 5, we should have gotten a check mark? Because it would be correct? But we got a dash, meaning that at position 5, it is not E. Therefore, the secret word does not have E at position 5. Similarly, if there were two E's, the one at 5 would have been correct? But it wasn't. So the secret word has exactly one E, at position 3.

Similarly, for A: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and got a dash, meaning A is present but not at 3. In the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check mark. If there were two A's, then when we put A at position 4 and it was correct, but if there was another A at say position 1, then in the first guess when we put A at position 3, we might have gotten a dash for the A at position 3 (because it's not at 3) but the A at position 1 would be unaccounted for? Actually, in the first guess, we only have one A, so if the secret has two A's, then the feedback for the first guess would still show one dash for A? Because the A at position 3 is not correct, but there is an A elsewhere? But it doesn't indicate how many. Similarly, in the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check, so that A is correct. If there were another A, we wouldn't know.

But in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and got a dash, meaning that there is at least one A in the word, but not at 3. Then in the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check, meaning that there is an A at position 4. Now, if there were another A, say at position 1, then when we guessed ""crane"", we had no A at position 1? So the feedback wouldn't show anything for position 1? But we had C at position 1 which was absent, so no A at position 1? Actually, we don't know because we didn't test position 1 with A.

To clarify: the feedback for the first guess only tells us about the letters we guessed. For A, we guessed it at position 3 and got a dash, meaning that the secret has an A, but not at 3. It doesn't tell us about other positions. Similarly, for the second guess, we guessed A at position 4 and got a check, meaning that the secret has an A at position 4. Now, if the secret had two A's, we wouldn't have any direct evidence against it? But we also don't have evidence for it.

However, in the second guess, we also have the letter A at position 4, and we got a check. If there were an A at position 1, for example, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess a letter at position 1 that is A? We guessed B at position 1, which is absent.

So it's possible that the secret word has an A at position 1? But wait, we have A at position 4. If there were an A at position 1, then the word would have two A's. But we don't know.

Similarly for R: we have R at position 2, and we don't know if there is another R.

But for E: we have E at position 3, and we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5. Also, in the second guess, we didn't test E at other positions? We only had E at position 3. So if there were another E, it could be at position 1? But we don't know.

However, the first guess: when we guessed E at position 5, we got a dash, meaning that E is present but not at 5. That doesn't rule out E at position 1? Because we didn't test position 1. Similarly, the second guess: we didn't test position 1 for E? We had B at position 1.

So it's possible that the secret word has E at position 1? But we already have E at position 3? So that would be two E's? And we know E is at position 3, so if there is an E at position 1, then the word has two E's.

But let's reconsider the first guess: we guessed ""crane"" with E at position 5. The feedback for E was a dash, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. If the secret word had E at position 1 and E at position 3, then when we guessed E at position 5, it would be absent? No, because there is an E in the word? So it would be marked as present? But since it's not at position 5, it would be a dash? So that is consistent. Then, when we guessed ""bread"" with E at position 3, we got a check, meaning that E is at position 3. But if there is also an E at position 1, we wouldn't know because we didn't test position 1.

Similarly, for the second guess, we had no E at position 1? We had B at position 1, which is absent.

So it's possible that the secret word has an E at position 1? But then we would have two E's? And we also have A at position 4? And R at position 2? Then the word would be E R E A [letter5]? But we need to find letter5.

But we also know that the secret word must have five letters, and we have three confirmed: R, E, A. If there is an E at position 1, then we have E, R, E, A, and one more? So the letters would be E (twice), R, A, and one other? But we don't know.

This is getting complex. To simplify, let's first assume no duplicates. Then the secret word has distinct letters: R, E, A, and two others (say X and Y) at positions 1 and 5.

We know X and Y are not C, N, B, D.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, U, M, P, H, G, K, etc.

Now, the word structure: [X] R E A [Y]

We need to guess a word that fits this pattern and tests possible X and Y.

But we don't have to stick to the pattern? We can guess any word? But we have three letters fixed: positions 2,3,4 are R, E, A. So we must have a word that has R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? And we are missing positions 1 and 5.

So the word must be of the form: ? R E A ?

We need to fill the first and last positions with letters that are not C, N, B, D, and that form a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- FREAK? F is not forbidden? But we don't know about F.
- TREAT? T is common? But T at position 1 and T at position 5? But we don't know about duplicates? But if we assume no duplicates, then ""TREAT"" has two T's? So not? 
- DREAM? But D is forbidden? We know D is absent? 
- CREAM? C is forbidden? 
- BREAK? B is forbidden? 
- GREAT? G is not forbidden? 
- WREAK? W is not forbidden? 

But we need to consider that we are guessing to get information. We already know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? So if we guess a word that has R at 2, E at 3, A at 4, then the feedback for positions 1 and 5 will tell us if the letters are correct or not? 

But we don't know what the letters are? So we need to test letters that are likely? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests new letters for positions 1 and 5.

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, N, B, D.

So let's list possible words ending with A? or not? 

Common words: 
- GREAT: G at 1, T at 5? 
- FREAK: F at 1, K at 5? 
- WREAK: W at 1, K at 5? 
- TREAT: T at 1, T at 5? (duplicate T) 
- PREPARE? Not 5 letters? 
- CREAK? C is forbidden? 
- STREAK? 6 letters? 

5-letter words: 
- AREA? Only 4 letters? 
- UREA? 4 letters? 

So: 
- GREAT: G and T? 
- FREAK: F and K? 
- WREAK: W and K? 
- TREAT: T and T? 
- BREAK: B is forbidden? 
- DREAD: D is forbidden? 

Also, ""PREYA""? Not a word? 

Another: ""UREAL""? Not common? 

""GREAT"" is a common word? 

But we don't know if G and T are in the word? 

We can guess ""GREAT"" to test G and T? 

If we guess ""GREAT"": 
- Position 1: G -> if correct, then G is at 1? Else, if absent, then G is not in the word? Or if present but wrong? But we have no other positions? So if G is not at 1, and if it's present, it would be at position 5? But position 5 is T? So if G is present, it must be at position 1? Because we have no other positions? So if we get G absent, then G is not in the word? Similarly for T at position 5: if T is at position 5, we get check? Else, if absent, then T is not in the word? Or if present but wrong position? But again, the only positions are 1 and 5? So if T is not at 5, and if it's present, it must be at position 1? But position 1 is G? So if we get T absent, then T is not in the word? 

But if we get G at position 1 as absent, but if the secret word has G at position 5? Then we would get T at position 5 as absent? But we are guessing T at position 5? So if the secret word has G at position 5, then when we guess T at position 5, we get absent? And G at position 1: we are guessing G, so if the secret has G at position 5, then G is present but not at position 1? So we would get a dash for G? 

Similarly, if the secret word has T at position 1, then we guess G at position 1: if G is not in the word, we get absent? And T at position 5: we guess T, but if the secret has T at position 1, then T is present but not at 5? So we get dash for T? 

Therefore, by guessing ""GREAT"", we can get information about G and T? 

But we also have other possibilities? For example, the secret word could be ""FREAK"" with F and K? Or ""WREAK"" with W and K? 

We need to choose a word that covers common letters? 

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that uses common letters for positions 1 and 5? 

Common letters for the first position: S, T, P, M, etc. 
Common letters for the last position: S, T, D, E, Y, etc. But E is already placed? 

But we know E is at 3, so not at 5? 

Common ending letters: S, T, Y, L, etc. 

So T is common? 

Also, S is very common? 

But we haven't tested S or T? 

So let's try to include S or T? 

But in ""GREAT"", we have T at the end? 

Another word: ""STREA"" not a word? 

""AREA"" is 4 letters? 

""UREA"" is 4? 

""CREAM"" has C? 

""STEAM"" doesn't have R at position 2? 

We need the pattern ? R E A ? 

So the word must have R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? 

So ""GREAT"" is one option? 

""TREAT"" is another? But has duplicate T? 

""FREAK"" is valid? 

""WREAK"" is valid? 

""PREP"" not 5? 

""OREAD""? ""OREAD"" is a word? Meaning a mountain nymph? But not common? 

""UREAL""? Not common? 

So common words: GREAT, FREAK, WREAK, TREAT? 

But TREAT has duplicate T? 

We can avoid duplicates? 

So among GREAT, FREAK, WREAK? 

GREAT has G and T? 
FREAK has F and K? 
WREAK has W and K? 

G, T, F, K, W are all possible? 

But T is more common than F, K, W? 

So ""GREAT"" might be a good guess? 

But we also have the possibility of duplicates? For example, the secret word could be ""AREA"" with 4 letters? No, 5 letters? 

Or ""UREAS""? Not? 

Another word: ""DREAR""? But D is forbidden? 

""BREAD"" we already guessed? 

So let's go with ""GREAT"". 

But we have to consider: if we guess ""GREAT"", and the secret word is ""FREAK"", then we will get: 
- G: absent? 
- R: correct? 
- E: correct? 
- A: correct? 
- T: absent? 

Then we know that position 1 is not G, and position 5 is not T? Then we can try ""FREAK"" next? 

Similarly, if the secret is ""WREAK"", we get similar feedback? 

But if the secret is ""GREAT"", we win? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses more common letters? But we are constrained by the fixed positions? 

Another idea: we can guess a word that doesn't necessarily have the fixed positions? But that might be inefficient? Because we know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? So we should use that? 

But we can also guess a word that tests other letters? For example, if we guess a word that has S or L? 

But we have to have R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? So we can't change that? 

Unless we want to test for duplicates? For example, if we guess a word that has an extra R or E or A? But we don't know. 

But let's not complicate? 

I think ""GREAT"" is a reasonable guess? 

But we have to make sure that G and T are not forbidden? We haven't used them? 

So let's guess ""GREAT"". 

But wait, what about the possibility of duplicates? For example, the secret word could be ""AREAE""? Not a word? Or ""UREAE""? Not? 

Common words with duplicates in this pattern? For example, ""TREAT"" has two T's? But we already considered? 

Or ""FREEE""? Not a word? 

So probably no common words with duplicates for this pattern? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""GREAT"". 

But let's confirm the feedback we would get for some possibilities:

- If secret is ""GREAT"": we get G✓, R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓ -> win.
- If secret is ""FREAK"": we get G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T(x) -> then we know it's not G or T, so next guess ""FREAK""?
- If secret is ""WREAK"": similarly, G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T(x) -> then we try ""WREAK""?
- If secret is ""TREAT"": we get G(x) for position 1? But we have T at position 1? So if we guess ""GREAT"", and secret is ""TREAT"", then:
   - G at position 1: absent? But T is at position 1? So we would get G(x) and T at position 5: we guess T, but secret has T at position 1 and 5? So at position 5, we have T? So we get T✓? 
   But wait: secret ""TREAT"": positions: T, R, E, A, T.
   Guess ""GREAT"": G, R, E, A, T.
   Feedback:
      Position 1: G vs T -> not match, and G is not in the secret? So absent (x)? 
      Position 2: R vs R -> ✓
      Position 3: E vs E -> ✓
      Position 4: A vs A -> ✓
      Position 5: T vs T -> ✓
   So we get: G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓ -> but we have four checks? But the secret has T at position 1? We didn't guess T at position 1? We guessed G? So we don't get any indication of T at position 1? 

   Then we would think that the word is ? R E A T, and we have G(x) so position 1 is not G? Then we might guess ""TREAT"" next? 

But we have T at position 5 correct? So the word ends with T? And we know positions 2,3,4 are R,E,A? So the word is ? R E A T? 

Then we need to find the first letter? It could be T? Or F? Or W? etc? 

But we know from the feedback that G is absent? So position 1 is not G? 

Then we can try ""TREAT"": 
   T at 1: if correct, then T✓, and we have T at 5? But we already know T at 5 is correct? 
   But if we guess ""TREAT"", we get T✓, R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓? 

But we already have four checks? 

After ""GREAT"" with feedback G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓, we know the word is ?REAT? with the last letter T? And the first letter is not G? 

Then we can guess words like ""TREAT"" (if we think duplicate T), or ""FREAT"" not a word? 

Common words: only ""TREAT"" and ""GREAT"" and ""WREAT"" not? 

""TREAT"" is the only common one? 

But we already guessed ""GREAT"" and got T at 5 correct? So the secret must be one of the words ending with T? 

But in English, 5-letter words with pattern ?REAT: 
- GREAT
- TREAT
- WREAT? Not common? 
- CREAT? Not? 

So only GREAT and TREAT? 

And we know it's not GREAT because we got G absent? So it must be TREAT? 

So we can guess TREAT next? 

But we have only one guess left? We have used two guesses? We have up to six? 

But in this case, after ""GREAT"" with G(x) and T✓, we can deduce TREAT? 

Similarly, if we get G(x) and T(x), then it might be FREAK or WREAK? 

So ""GREAT"" is a good guess? 

But we have to consider that the secret might have other letters? For example, ""DREAM"" but D is forbidden? 

Or ""BREAK"" B forbidden? 

Or ""STREAK"" 6 letters? 

So I think ""GREAT"" is a good choice. 

Therefore, I'll guess ""GREAT"". 

But let's see the feedback we have: we know A is at 4, E at 3, R at 2? So the word is ?REA? 

And we are guessing ""GREAT"" to test G and T? 

Yes. 

So <guess>great</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(absent), R(correct), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(present but wrong position)
- **Guess 2: bread** → B(absent), R(correct), E(correct), A(correct), D(absent)

### Key Insights:
1. **R** is confirmed at **position 2**.
2. **E** is confirmed at **position 3**.
3. **A** is confirmed at **position 4**.
4. **C, N, B, D** are absent (not in the word).
5. The secret word has the structure: `[letter1] R E A [letter5]`.
6. **letter1** and **letter5** must be:
   - Letters not yet tested or ruled out (e.g., common letters like S, T, L, G, F, W, K).
   - Not C, N, B, or D (absent per feedback).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test high-frequency letters for positions 1 and 5 (e.g., **G** and **T**) to maximize information.
- Use a valid word that fits the known structure (`?REA?`) and includes plausible letters.
- **GREAT** is ideal because:
  - It tests **G** at position 1 (common starting letter).
  - It tests **T** at position 5 (common ending letter).
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, N, B, D).
  - Feedback will directly reveal if **G** or **T** are correct/absent, narrowing possibilities significantly (e.g., to words like `TREAT`, `FREAK`, or `WREAK` if not `GREAT`).

<guess>great</guess>",great,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- A: present but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""bread""
- B: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓) at position 2 (as before)
- E: correct (✓) at position 3 -> so E is at position 3
- A: correct (✓) at position 4 -> so A is at position 4
- D: absent (x)

Now, combining the information:

1. Position 2 is R (from both guesses).
2. Position 3 is E (from second guess: E is correct at position 3).
3. Position 4 is A (from second guess: A is correct at position 4).

We also know:
- From the first guess, A was not at position 3 (which is consistent because now we know it's at 4) and E was not at position 5 (which is consistent because we now know E is at 3, not 5).
- The secret word has the form: [letter1] R E A [letter5]

We also know that C, N, B, and D are absent (from the x's).

We need to find the first and fifth letters.

Constraints:
- The first letter cannot be C, N, B, or D (since they are absent).
- The fifth letter cannot be C, N, B, D, or E (because E is at position 3, and we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5, which is consistent). Also, note that E is already placed at 3, so it can't be at 5.

Additionally, we know from the first guess that the word contains A and E (which we've placed) and R (placed). But are there any other letters? The first guess had five letters: C, R, A, N, E. We know C and N are absent, so the only letters present were R, A, E. Similarly, the second guess had B, R, E, A, D. We know B and D are absent, so again, only R, E, A are present? But wait, the secret word has five letters. We have three letters: R, E, A. So we are missing two: one at position 1 and one at position 5.

But note: the feedback from the first guess said that A and E are present (but in wrong positions) and R is correct. It didn't say anything about other letters? Actually, the first guess had five letters, and we got:
- C: absent
- R: correct
- A: present (but wrong position)
- N: absent
- E: present (but wrong position)

So the secret word must contain R, A, E, and two other letters that are not C or N. Similarly, the second guess: B and D are absent, so the secret word does not contain B or D.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: a letter that is not C, N, B, D, and not R, A, E (since those are already placed? but R, A, E are at positions 2,4,3, so they could be duplicated? But we don't know. However, the feedback from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", we had A and E marked as present, but if there were duplicates, we might not have seen it? The standard Wordle rules: if a letter is duplicated in the guess but not in the secret, it might show as absent for the extra ones. But in this case, we don't have duplicates in the guesses.

To be safe, we should not assume duplicates unless necessary. Since we have three confirmed letters (R, E, A) and two positions to fill, and the word has five letters, it's possible that there are duplicates? But we haven't seen any indication of duplicates so far.

Given the feedback, let's see if duplicates are possible:

- In the first guess, we had one A and one E, and both were marked as present (but wrong positions). If the secret had two A's, for example, then if we guessed one A in the wrong position, it would still show as present. Similarly for E. But we don't have evidence for duplicates.

Moreover, in the second guess, we had one E and one A, and they were both marked correct at positions 3 and 4. If the secret had duplicates, then if we guessed only one, we might not see the duplicate? But we don't know.

However, without evidence, it's simpler to assume no duplicates for now.

So, the secret word has exactly the letters: R, E, A, and two other letters (say X and Y) at positions 1 and 5.

We know that X (position 1) and Y (position 5) are not C, N, B, D.

Also, they cannot be R, E, A? Because if they were, then we would have duplicates? But we don't know. Let's not rule out duplicates entirely.

But note: if position 1 were R, that would be duplicate R? But we have R at position 2. Similarly, if position 1 were E, but we have E at position 3? Or position 5 were A? But we have A at position 4.

But in the feedback for the second guess, we have:
- B: absent -> so no B
- R: correct at 2 -> so R is at 2, and if there were another R, it might be at position 1 or 5? But we don't know.

Similarly, for E: we have E at 3, so if there were another E, it could be at 1 or 5? But the first guess had E at 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position? That would be consistent with E being at 3 and also at 5? But wait, the first guess had E at position 5, and we got a dash, meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So if the secret word had two E's, one at 3 and one at 5, then when we guessed E at 5, we should have gotten a check mark? Because it would be correct? But we got a dash, meaning that at position 5, it is not E. Therefore, the secret word does not have E at position 5. Similarly, if there were two E's, the one at 5 would have been correct? But it wasn't. So the secret word has exactly one E, at position 3.

Similarly, for A: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and got a dash, meaning A is present but not at 3. In the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check mark. If there were two A's, then when we put A at position 4 and it was correct, but if there was another A at say position 1, then in the first guess when we put A at position 3, we might have gotten a dash for the A at position 3 (because it's not at 3) but the A at position 1 would be unaccounted for? Actually, in the first guess, we only have one A, so if the secret has two A's, then the feedback for the first guess would still show one dash for A? Because the A at position 3 is not correct, but there is an A elsewhere? But it doesn't indicate how many. Similarly, in the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check, so that A is correct. If there were another A, we wouldn't know.

But in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and got a dash, meaning that there is at least one A in the word, but not at 3. Then in the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check, meaning that there is an A at position 4. Now, if there were another A, say at position 1, then when we guessed ""crane"", we had no A at position 1? So the feedback wouldn't show anything for position 1? But we had C at position 1 which was absent, so no A at position 1? Actually, we don't know because we didn't test position 1 with A.

To clarify: the feedback for the first guess only tells us about the letters we guessed. For A, we guessed it at position 3 and got a dash, meaning that the secret has an A, but not at 3. It doesn't tell us about other positions. Similarly, for the second guess, we guessed A at position 4 and got a check, meaning that the secret has an A at position 4. Now, if the secret had two A's, we wouldn't have any direct evidence against it? But we also don't have evidence for it.

However, in the second guess, we also have the letter A at position 4, and we got a check. If there were an A at position 1, for example, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess a letter at position 1 that is A? We guessed B at position 1, which is absent.

So it's possible that the secret word has an A at position 1? But wait, we have A at position 4. If there were an A at position 1, then the word would have two A's. But we don't know.

Similarly for R: we have R at position 2, and we don't know if there is another R.

But for E: we have E at position 3, and we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5. Also, in the second guess, we didn't test E at other positions? We only had E at position 3. So if there were another E, it could be at position 1? But we don't know.

However, the first guess: when we guessed E at position 5, we got a dash, meaning that E is present but not at 5. That doesn't rule out E at position 1? Because we didn't test position 1. Similarly, the second guess: we didn't test position 1 for E? We had B at position 1.

So it's possible that the secret word has E at position 1? But we already have E at position 3? So that would be two E's? And we know E is at position 3, so if there is an E at position 1, then the word has two E's.

But let's reconsider the first guess: we guessed ""crane"" with E at position 5. The feedback for E was a dash, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. If the secret word had E at position 1 and E at position 3, then when we guessed E at position 5, it would be absent? No, because there is an E in the word? So it would be marked as present? But since it's not at position 5, it would be a dash? So that is consistent. Then, when we guessed ""bread"" with E at position 3, we got a check, meaning that E is at position 3. But if there is also an E at position 1, we wouldn't know because we didn't test position 1.

Similarly, for the second guess, we had no E at position 1? We had B at position 1, which is absent.

So it's possible that the secret word has an E at position 1? But then we would have two E's? And we also have A at position 4? And R at position 2? Then the word would be E R E A [letter5]? But we need to find letter5.

But we also know that the secret word must have five letters, and we have three confirmed: R, E, A. If there is an E at position 1, then we have E, R, E, A, and one more? So the letters would be E (twice), R, A, and one other? But we don't know.

This is getting complex. To simplify, let's first assume no duplicates. Then the secret word has distinct letters: R, E, A, and two others (say X and Y) at positions 1 and 5.

We know X and Y are not C, N, B, D.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, U, M, P, H, G, K, etc.

Now, the word structure: [X] R E A [Y]

We need to guess a word that fits this pattern and tests possible X and Y.

But we don't have to stick to the pattern? We can guess any word? But we have three letters fixed: positions 2,3,4 are R, E, A. So we must have a word that has R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? And we are missing positions 1 and 5.

So the word must be of the form: ? R E A ?

We need to fill the first and last positions with letters that are not C, N, B, D, and that form a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- FREAK? F is not forbidden? But we don't know about F.
- TREAT? T is common? But T at position 1 and T at position 5? But we don't know about duplicates? But if we assume no duplicates, then ""TREAT"" has two T's? So not? 
- DREAM? But D is forbidden? We know D is absent? 
- CREAM? C is forbidden? 
- BREAK? B is forbidden? 
- GREAT? G is not forbidden? 
- WREAK? W is not forbidden? 

But we need to consider that we are guessing to get information. We already know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? So if we guess a word that has R at 2, E at 3, A at 4, then the feedback for positions 1 and 5 will tell us if the letters are correct or not? 

But we don't know what the letters are? So we need to test letters that are likely? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests new letters for positions 1 and 5.

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, N, B, D.

So let's list possible words ending with A? or not? 

Common words: 
- GREAT: G at 1, T at 5? 
- FREAK: F at 1, K at 5? 
- WREAK: W at 1, K at 5? 
- TREAT: T at 1, T at 5? (duplicate T) 
- PREPARE? Not 5 letters? 
- CREAK? C is forbidden? 
- STREAK? 6 letters? 

5-letter words: 
- AREA? Only 4 letters? 
- UREA? 4 letters? 

So: 
- GREAT: G and T? 
- FREAK: F and K? 
- WREAK: W and K? 
- TREAT: T and T? 
- BREAK: B is forbidden? 
- DREAD: D is forbidden? 

Also, ""PREYA""? Not a word? 

Another: ""UREAL""? Not common? 

""GREAT"" is a common word? 

But we don't know if G and T are in the word? 

We can guess ""GREAT"" to test G and T? 

If we guess ""GREAT"": 
- Position 1: G -> if correct, then G is at 1? Else, if absent, then G is not in the word? Or if present but wrong? But we have no other positions? So if G is not at 1, and if it's present, it would be at position 5? But position 5 is T? So if G is present, it must be at position 1? Because we have no other positions? So if we get G absent, then G is not in the word? Similarly for T at position 5: if T is at position 5, we get check? Else, if absent, then T is not in the word? Or if present but wrong position? But again, the only positions are 1 and 5? So if T is not at 5, and if it's present, it must be at position 1? But position 1 is G? So if we get T absent, then T is not in the word? 

But if we get G at position 1 as absent, but if the secret word has G at position 5? Then we would get T at position 5 as absent? But we are guessing T at position 5? So if the secret word has G at position 5, then when we guess T at position 5, we get absent? And G at position 1: we are guessing G, so if the secret has G at position 5, then G is present but not at position 1? So we would get a dash for G? 

Similarly, if the secret word has T at position 1, then we guess G at position 1: if G is not in the word, we get absent? And T at position 5: we guess T, but if the secret has T at position 1, then T is present but not at 5? So we get dash for T? 

Therefore, by guessing ""GREAT"", we can get information about G and T? 

But we also have other possibilities? For example, the secret word could be ""FREAK"" with F and K? Or ""WREAK"" with W and K? 

We need to choose a word that covers common letters? 

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that uses common letters for positions 1 and 5? 

Common letters for the first position: S, T, P, M, etc. 
Common letters for the last position: S, T, D, E, Y, etc. But E is already placed? 

But we know E is at 3, so not at 5? 

Common ending letters: S, T, Y, L, etc. 

So T is common? 

Also, S is very common? 

But we haven't tested S or T? 

So let's try to include S or T? 

But in ""GREAT"", we have T at the end? 

Another word: ""STREA"" not a word? 

""AREA"" is 4 letters? 

""UREA"" is 4? 

""CREAM"" has C? 

""STEAM"" doesn't have R at position 2? 

We need the pattern ? R E A ? 

So the word must have R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? 

So ""GREAT"" is one option? 

""TREAT"" is another? But has duplicate T? 

""FREAK"" is valid? 

""WREAK"" is valid? 

""PREP"" not 5? 

""OREAD""? ""OREAD"" is a word? Meaning a mountain nymph? But not common? 

""UREAL""? Not common? 

So common words: GREAT, FREAK, WREAK, TREAT? 

But TREAT has duplicate T? 

We can avoid duplicates? 

So among GREAT, FREAK, WREAK? 

GREAT has G and T? 
FREAK has F and K? 
WREAK has W and K? 

G, T, F, K, W are all possible? 

But T is more common than F, K, W? 

So ""GREAT"" might be a good guess? 

But we also have the possibility of duplicates? For example, the secret word could be ""AREA"" with 4 letters? No, 5 letters? 

Or ""UREAS""? Not? 

Another word: ""DREAR""? But D is forbidden? 

""BREAD"" we already guessed? 

So let's go with ""GREAT"". 

But we have to consider: if we guess ""GREAT"", and the secret word is ""FREAK"", then we will get: 
- G: absent? 
- R: correct? 
- E: correct? 
- A: correct? 
- T: absent? 

Then we know that position 1 is not G, and position 5 is not T? Then we can try ""FREAK"" next? 

Similarly, if the secret is ""WREAK"", we get similar feedback? 

But if the secret is ""GREAT"", we win? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses more common letters? But we are constrained by the fixed positions? 

Another idea: we can guess a word that doesn't necessarily have the fixed positions? But that might be inefficient? Because we know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? So we should use that? 

But we can also guess a word that tests other letters? For example, if we guess a word that has S or L? 

But we have to have R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? So we can't change that? 

Unless we want to test for duplicates? For example, if we guess a word that has an extra R or E or A? But we don't know. 

But let's not complicate? 

I think ""GREAT"" is a reasonable guess? 

But we have to make sure that G and T are not forbidden? We haven't used them? 

So let's guess ""GREAT"". 

But wait, what about the possibility of duplicates? For example, the secret word could be ""AREAE""? Not a word? Or ""UREAE""? Not? 

Common words with duplicates in this pattern? For example, ""TREAT"" has two T's? But we already considered? 

Or ""FREEE""? Not a word? 

So probably no common words with duplicates for this pattern? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""GREAT"". 

But let's confirm the feedback we would get for some possibilities:

- If secret is ""GREAT"": we get G✓, R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓ -> win.
- If secret is ""FREAK"": we get G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T(x) -> then we know it's not G or T, so next guess ""FREAK""?
- If secret is ""WREAK"": similarly, G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T(x) -> then we try ""WREAK""?
- If secret is ""TREAT"": we get G(x) for position 1? But we have T at position 1? So if we guess ""GREAT"", and secret is ""TREAT"", then:
   - G at position 1: absent? But T is at position 1? So we would get G(x) and T at position 5: we guess T, but secret has T at position 1 and 5? So at position 5, we have T? So we get T✓? 
   But wait: secret ""TREAT"": positions: T, R, E, A, T.
   Guess ""GREAT"": G, R, E, A, T.
   Feedback:
      Position 1: G vs T -> not match, and G is not in the secret? So absent (x)? 
      Position 2: R vs R -> ✓
      Position 3: E vs E -> ✓
      Position 4: A vs A -> ✓
      Position 5: T vs T -> ✓
   So we get: G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓ -> but we have four checks? But the secret has T at position 1? We didn't guess T at position 1? We guessed G? So we don't get any indication of T at position 1? 

   Then we would think that the word is ? R E A T, and we have G(x) so position 1 is not G? Then we might guess ""TREAT"" next? 

But we have T at position 5 correct? So the word ends with T? And we know positions 2,3,4 are R,E,A? So the word is ? R E A T? 

Then we need to find the first letter? It could be T? Or F? Or W? etc? 

But we know from the feedback that G is absent? So position 1 is not G? 

Then we can try ""TREAT"": 
   T at 1: if correct, then T✓, and we have T at 5? But we already know T at 5 is correct? 
   But if we guess ""TREAT"", we get T✓, R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓? 

But we already have four checks? 

After ""GREAT"" with feedback G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓, we know the word is ?REAT? with the last letter T? And the first letter is not G? 

Then we can guess words like ""TREAT"" (if we think duplicate T), or ""FREAT"" not a word? 

Common words: only ""TREAT"" and ""GREAT"" and ""WREAT"" not? 

""TREAT"" is the only common one? 

But we already guessed ""GREAT"" and got T at 5 correct? So the secret must be one of the words ending with T? 

But in English, 5-letter words with pattern ?REAT: 
- GREAT
- TREAT
- WREAT? Not common? 
- CREAT? Not? 

So only GREAT and TREAT? 

And we know it's not GREAT because we got G absent? So it must be TREAT? 

So we can guess TREAT next? 

But we have only one guess left? We have used two guesses? We have up to six? 

But in this case, after ""GREAT"" with G(x) and T✓, we can deduce TREAT? 

Similarly, if we get G(x) and T(x), then it might be FREAK or WREAK? 

So ""GREAT"" is a good guess? 

But we have to consider that the secret might have other letters? For example, ""DREAM"" but D is forbidden? 

Or ""BREAK"" B forbidden? 

Or ""STREAK"" 6 letters? 

So I think ""GREAT"" is a good choice. 

Therefore, I'll guess ""GREAT"". 

But let's see the feedback we have: we know A is at 4, E at 3, R at 2? So the word is ?REA? 

And we are guessing ""GREAT"" to test G and T? 

Yes. 

So <guess>great</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(absent), R(correct), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(present but wrong position)
- **Guess 2: bread** → B(absent), R(correct), E(correct), A(correct), D(absent)

### Key Insights:
1. **R** is confirmed at **position 2**.
2. **E** is confirmed at **position 3**.
3. **A** is confirmed at **position 4**.
4. **C, N, B, D** are absent (not in the word).
5. The secret word has the structure: `[letter1] R E A [letter5]`.
6. **letter1** and **letter5** must be:
   - Letters not yet tested or ruled out (e.g., common letters like S, T, L, G, F, W, K).
   - Not C, N, B, or D (absent per feedback).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test high-frequency letters for positions 1 and 5 (e.g., **G** and **T**) to maximize information.
- Use a valid word that fits the known structure (`?REA?`) and includes plausible letters.
- **GREAT** is ideal because:
  - It tests **G** at position 1 (common starting letter).
  - It tests **T** at position 5 (common ending letter).
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, N, B, D).
  - Feedback will directly reveal if **G** or **T** are correct/absent, narrowing possibilities significantly (e.g., to words like `TREAT`, `FREAK`, or `WREAK` if not `GREAT`).",Guess 3: great -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) E(✓) A(✓) T(x),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we need a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common letters in English include vowels (A,E,I,O,U) and frequent consonants (R,S,T,L,N, etc.).
 Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", etc. We'll choose one that balances common letters and frequency.

 Let's choose ""ROATE"". Why?
 - It has relatively common letters: R, O, A, T, E.
 - It contains three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T).

 However, note that the rules require 5-letter English words. ""ROATE"" is a valid word (it is a financial term meaning the profit from an investment).

 We'll go with ""ROATE"".

 If the user says we cannot use this word, we might pick another, but for now, let's use it.

 Thus, our first guess: ROATE.For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover frequent letters. After considering options, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- C, R, A, N, and E are all highly frequent in English words.
- This combination helps test multiple letter positions broadly.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(-)
 Interpretation:
 - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since the word is 1-based: position 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E).
 - A is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed A at position 3, it must be elsewhere (either position 1, 4, or 5? but positions are fixed). Actually, A could be in positions 1, 4, or 5? Note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But A is not in position 3 because we got a dash (meaning wrong position). Also, we know position 2 is R (correct).
 - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so not at position 5? because we placed it at position 5 and got dash). Similarly, E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4? But not position 2 because that is R (which is fixed).
 - C and N are not in the word at all.

 So what we know:
 - The second letter is R (position 2).
 - The word contains A and E, but not at the positions we guessed: 
      A is not at position 3 (because we got dash for wrong position), 
      E is not at position 5 (because we got dash).
 - The word does not contain C or N.

 Also, since A is in the word but not at position 3, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we must place them elsewhere.

 Possible positions for A: must be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But note: position 2 is taken by R, so A cannot be there. Similarly, for E: positions 1, 3, or 4? Because position 2 is R.

 However, we must also consider that the word has exactly 5 letters and we know one letter (R at position 2).

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]
 And we know:
 - letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5 are unknown.
 - The word includes A and E (each exactly once? but we don't know if there are duplicates). However, without more info, we assume unique unless proven otherwise.

 Also, we know that A is not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 4, or 5) and E is not at position 5 (so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4).

 Since C and N are out, we avoid those letters.

 We have two new letters to place: A and E.

 Strategy for the next guess:
 - We want to confirm the positions of A and E, and also test other common letters.
 - We know the word has R in the middle, and includes A and E.

 Consider possible words. For example, words that have R in the second position.

 We also know that our guess must be a valid 5-letter word.

 Let's list some possibilities? But we don't need to list all; we need a word that includes A and E in different positions and avoids C and N, and also introduces new letters to gather more information.

 Common letters we haven't tested: we haven't used S, T, L, O, D, H, etc.

 We should aim to test A and E in new positions and cover unknown spots.

 How about placing A at position 1 or 4 or 5? And E at position 1, 3, or 4? But note: we can't put E at position 5? because we know it's not there (from feedback: dash for E at position 5 means E is present but not there).

 For our next guess, let's try to put A in a position that we don't know yet, and similarly for E.

 What positions are still unknown? All except position 2.

 We are going to test A at position 1? But then we can't test E at position 1? So maybe we put A at position 1 and E at position 3? Or A at position 4 and E at position 3? etc.

 But note: if we put A at position 1 and E at position 3, then the word would be: A R [E?] [new] [new]. However, we know that A cannot be at position 3? from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for A was dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So putting A at position 1 would be a valid test.

 Alternatively, to cover more ground, we might use a word that has A and E in the remaining possible positions and some new common letters.

 Top idea: use the word ""RADAR""? But that has two R's? We already have R fixed at position 2. Also, we are avoiding duplicate letters? Not necessarily, but we don't know. However, let's choose a word without duplicates to avoid complexity? But ""RADAR"" duplicates R and A? So not ideal.

 Another idea: word with second letter R and including A and E? Let's think.

 Possible words: 
 - ""ARISE"": this has A at position 1, R at position 2? That matches. Then I at position 3? But we don't know about I. Then S at 4, E at 5? But note: we had E at position 5 in the first guess and got dash? That means if the secret word has E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have gotten E as dash? Actually, no: we guessed crane -> E at position 5 was marked dash meaning E is present but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 in a new guess, that would be invalid? But wait: the secret word could have E at position 5? No, because the feedback for E was dash meaning it is in the word but not at that position (so not at 5). Hence, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word. Therefore, we shouldn't put E at position 5 in our guess if we want to test other possibilities? Actually, we can put E anywhere but we know now that in the secret word E is not at position 5.

 So in ""ARISE"":
   Position 1: A -> but we know A is in the word? Yes. And we know from first guess that A is not at position 3. Now we put it at position 1: if it becomes correct then we know A is at position 1, else if dash then it exists but we know it's not at position 1? This would help.
   Position 2: R -> we know it's correct so we'll get check mark no matter what? Actually, we already know it's correct so we must put R at position 2.
   Position 3: I -> new letter.
   Position 4: S -> new letter.
   Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at position 5? Because the feedback for the first guess said E is not at position 5. So putting E at position 5 in our guess: if the secret word had E at position 5, we would not have gotten the dash? So if we get a dash for E at position 5 again? It would be inconsistent? Actually, from the feedback of the first guess: the secret word has E, but not at position 5. So if we guess E at position 5 and we get a dash, it would confirm that the secret word does not have E at position 5 (which we already know) and if we get a cross? We would get a cross only if E is not present? but we know E is present? So if we put E at a position 5 and we get a dash, that wouldn't be possible? Because the dash means it is present but not here? But we know the secret word has E? So actually, if we put E at position 5 we should get either:
      - a cross: but that would contradict the first feedback? because the first feedback said we have E? So we cannot get a cross? 
      - a dash: meaning E is present but not at position 5? That is what we already know.

 But in fact, we know E is present? So if we put E at position 5, the feedback must be a dash? Because we know the secret word does have an E, and we're placing it at position 5? Then it must be that the secret word's E is not at position 5? So we'll get dash? And we learn nothing new? 

 Why test that? It wastes a slot. Therefore, we shouldn't put E at position 5 because we already know that position 5 is not E.

 Similarly, we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3? Then we must get a dash? But we already know it's not at position 3? So we would get dash? Then we learn nothing? 

 So we should put A and E at positions that we don't know? So for A: positions 1, 4, and 5 are possible? For E: positions 1, 3, and 4 are possible? But note: in one word we can test A at one of these and E at one of these? But also we need to test other letters.

 Since we have a known letter R at position 2, let's choose a word that:
 - Has R at position 2.
 - Places A at either position 1, 4, or 5 (we pick one we haven't eliminated).
 - Places E at either position 1, 3, or 4 (but avoiding positions where A is? unless same).

 We need to avoid the known bad positions? So don't put A at position 3? And don't put E at position 5? But that's automatic because we are going to put them elsewhere.

 To maximize information, let's put A at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we test two new letters? And we leave position 3 and 5 for new letters? 

 Example word: ""A R E S T"" -> ""AREST""? Not a word? 

 ""A R E A L""? ""AREAL"": valid word? But it has two A's? We don't want duplicates? We don't know the secret word has duplicates? So avoid?

 ""A R E S"" — wait position 4? Need letter for position 4? And position 5? The word would be ""AR?E?"".

 How about ""AROSE""?
   A at 1, R at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5? We've been told that E is not at position 5? Why guess it again? 

 Let me think: the secret word doesn't have E at position 5? So in ""AROSE"", we are putting E at position 5 which we know is incorrect? Then we will get a dash for E? That's redundant? And A is at position 1? That might be new.

 So let's avoid E at position 5. Then we must put E at position 1? But position 1 would be both A and E? No, we can choose only one? 

 We can put E at position 3? Then the word format: [E at position 3]? 

 Or we put E at position 4? Then we don't test position 5 for E? Because we know position 5 is not E? 

 So let me look for words that:
   Position 1: A? 
   Position 2: R (fixed)
   Position 3: E? Or E should be elsewhere? But E can't be at position 5? And if we put E at position 3, that would be testing a position that A was (but A at 3 was wrong)? It is valid? Actually, we have no feedback for position 3? We only know that A is not at position 3? But E might be at position 3? 

 So possible word: ""A R E E S""? Not? 

 Alternatively: put A at position 4? Then word structure: [?] R [?] A [?]

 And E at position 3? Then: [new1] R E A [new2]

 Example: word ""BREA?"": ""BREAD"" -> but E is at position 3? 
 But: ""BREAD"": 
   Position 1: B
   Position 2: R -> correct
   Position 3: E -> we put E at 3? 
   Position 4: A
   Position 5: D

 But note: we have A and E: A is at position 4? And E at position 3? This is good because we are testing A and E in new positions.

 And we avoid any known problem? Also, we are introducing B and D? Which are not tested? But we haven't been told anything about B and D? So we test them.

 Therefore, I suggest ""BREAD"".

 But let's see: 
 - We know R is correct at 2.
 - If A is in the word? We put A at position 4: if we get check mark? Then A is at 4? Else, if dash? Then A is not at 4? Then must be at position 1 or 5? 
 - Similarly, E at position 3: if we get check mark? Then E is at 3? Else, if dash? Then E is elsewhere? 
 - We also get feedback for B and D? 

 Alternatively, we might choose ""PARED"": 
   P at 1, A at 3? But wait, we know A is not at position 3? So we shouldn't put A at 3? Because it will definitely give a dash? Then not helpful? 

 So ""BREAD"" seems valid? Let me check if ""bread"" is a valid word? Yes? It's common.

 Another candidate: ""TRADE""? 
   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3? But wait: we know A is not at position 3? Therefore, if we put ""TRADE"": 
      Position 1: T
      Position 2: R -> ✓
      Position 3: A -> we should definitely get dash? Because we know A is not at 3? So if we get dash? We don't learn anything? 
      Position 4: D
      Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at 5? So we get dash? 

 Then we waste two positions: A at 3 (already known to be wrong) and E at 5 (already known wrong) -> inefficient? 

 Therefore, avoid placing A at any position we know it's not? And avoid E at any position we know it's not? 

 So ""TRADE"" is bad? 

 Let's choose ""BREAD"": 
   B at position 1: new? 
   R at 2: ✓
   E at 3: test this position? We don't know where E is? 
   A at 4: test? Because we don't know if A is at 4?
   D at 5: new? 

 Since we know E is not at 5? But we are putting D at 5? So that's okay? 

 This seems efficient? 

 However, note: we were told that A is in the word? So if A is at position 4? Then we'll get ✓ for A? 
 We were told that E is in the word? So if E is at position 3? Then we get ✓ for E? 

 But what if E is actually not at 3? Then we get dash for E? And we know E must be at positions 1 or 4? But position 4 is A? So then E could only be at position 1? Or position 4? But wait, if we are putting A at 4, then E cannot be at 4? So then E must be at position 1? Or if duplicates? We avoid duplicates? 

 So we are introducing new letters: B and D? 

 Let's consider: 
 - If E is not at position 3? Then after this guess we will see E at position 3 marked as dash? Then we know E must be somewhere else? And then we try position 1? Or we can deduce.

 Similarly, if A is not at position 4? Then we get dash? And we know A must be at position 1 or 5? 

 This guess will help us quickly pin down positions? 

 Therefore, I choose ""BREAD"" as the next guess.

 But wait: what about introducing more new common letters? We also have the option to use letters like S, T, L, etc? 

 In ""BREAD"": letters B, R, E, A, D? We already have R, E, A? And we add B and D? B is less common? We could use T, S, L, etc? 

 Alternatively, how about ""SUPER""? Not second letter R? 

 Or ""GRAVE""? 
   G at 1? 
   R at 2: ✓
   A at 3? But we know A is not at 3? -> so bad? 

 Or ""PARSE"": 
   P at 1, A at 3? again A at 3 -> bad? 

 So I stick with ""BREAD"".

 Another candidate: ""TRACE""? But C is blacklisted? We know C is not in the word? So we cannot use letters C? And also N is not? So avoid C and N? 

 Therefore, ""BREAD"" is valid? 

 Let me check: 
   We know C and N are not in the word? So we avoid B? Why B? Because it hasn't been tested? It's not forbidden? 

 We can also choose ""BRAKE""? 
   B at 1,
   R at 2 -> ✓,
   A at 3? Wait: we know A is not at 3? Then we must get dash? So we waste A? 
   K at 4? 
   E at 5? But E at 5: we know E is not at 5? So we must get dash? 
   So two dashes: the same as above? Only we test K? 

 Then we'd be equally? But ""BREAD"" tests two letters? 

 How about ""OPERA""? 
   O at 1? 
   P at 2? But position 2 must be R? So we must put R at position 2? 

 So we must have second letter R? So ""OPERA"" doesn't have R at position 2? 

 Hence, I'll go with ""BREAD"".

 Final decision: guess ""BREAD""

 But note: ""BREAD"" is the word? And we hope to get feedback that will clarify positions of A and E?Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(-)), we know:
- **R** is in the correct position (position 2).
- **A** is in the word but not in position 3.
- **E** is in the word but not in position 5.
- **C** and **N** are absent.

For the next guess, we prioritize:
- Retaining **R** in position 2.
- Testing **A** and **E** in new possible positions (A not at 3, E not at 5).
- Introducing new common letters like **B** and **D** to gain additional information.

The word **""BREAD""** fits perfectly:
- B at position 1 (new letter test).
- R at position 2 (known correct).
- E at position 3 (tests if E is here).
- A at position 4 (tests if A is here).
- D at position 5 (new letter test).

This avoids redundant guesses and efficiently narrows possibilities for A, E, and new letters.

<guess>bread</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: bread -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) E(✓) A(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓) at position 2
- A: present but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3
- N: absent (x)
- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 2: ""bread""
- B: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓) at position 2 (as before)
- E: correct (✓) at position 3 -> so E is at position 3
- A: correct (✓) at position 4 -> so A is at position 4
- D: absent (x)

Now, combining the information:

1. Position 2 is R (from both guesses).
2. Position 3 is E (from second guess: E is correct at position 3).
3. Position 4 is A (from second guess: A is correct at position 4).

We also know:
- From the first guess, A was not at position 3 (which is consistent because now we know it's at 4) and E was not at position 5 (which is consistent because we now know E is at 3, not 5).
- The secret word has the form: [letter1] R E A [letter5]

We also know that C, N, B, and D are absent (from the x's).

We need to find the first and fifth letters.

Constraints:
- The first letter cannot be C, N, B, or D (since they are absent).
- The fifth letter cannot be C, N, B, D, or E (because E is at position 3, and we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5, which is consistent). Also, note that E is already placed at 3, so it can't be at 5.

Additionally, we know from the first guess that the word contains A and E (which we've placed) and R (placed). But are there any other letters? The first guess had five letters: C, R, A, N, E. We know C and N are absent, so the only letters present were R, A, E. Similarly, the second guess had B, R, E, A, D. We know B and D are absent, so again, only R, E, A are present? But wait, the secret word has five letters. We have three letters: R, E, A. So we are missing two: one at position 1 and one at position 5.

But note: the feedback from the first guess said that A and E are present (but in wrong positions) and R is correct. It didn't say anything about other letters? Actually, the first guess had five letters, and we got:
- C: absent
- R: correct
- A: present (but wrong position)
- N: absent
- E: present (but wrong position)

So the secret word must contain R, A, E, and two other letters that are not C or N. Similarly, the second guess: B and D are absent, so the secret word does not contain B or D.

Therefore, the secret word has:
- Position 1: a letter that is not C, N, B, D, and not R, A, E (since those are already placed? but R, A, E are at positions 2,4,3, so they could be duplicated? But we don't know. However, the feedback from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", we had A and E marked as present, but if there were duplicates, we might not have seen it? The standard Wordle rules: if a letter is duplicated in the guess but not in the secret, it might show as absent for the extra ones. But in this case, we don't have duplicates in the guesses.

To be safe, we should not assume duplicates unless necessary. Since we have three confirmed letters (R, E, A) and two positions to fill, and the word has five letters, it's possible that there are duplicates? But we haven't seen any indication of duplicates so far.

Given the feedback, let's see if duplicates are possible:

- In the first guess, we had one A and one E, and both were marked as present (but wrong positions). If the secret had two A's, for example, then if we guessed one A in the wrong position, it would still show as present. Similarly for E. But we don't have evidence for duplicates.

Moreover, in the second guess, we had one E and one A, and they were both marked correct at positions 3 and 4. If the secret had duplicates, then if we guessed only one, we might not see the duplicate? But we don't know.

However, without evidence, it's simpler to assume no duplicates for now.

So, the secret word has exactly the letters: R, E, A, and two other letters (say X and Y) at positions 1 and 5.

We know that X (position 1) and Y (position 5) are not C, N, B, D.

Also, they cannot be R, E, A? Because if they were, then we would have duplicates? But we don't know. Let's not rule out duplicates entirely.

But note: if position 1 were R, that would be duplicate R? But we have R at position 2. Similarly, if position 1 were E, but we have E at position 3? Or position 5 were A? But we have A at position 4.

But in the feedback for the second guess, we have:
- B: absent -> so no B
- R: correct at 2 -> so R is at 2, and if there were another R, it might be at position 1 or 5? But we don't know.

Similarly, for E: we have E at 3, so if there were another E, it could be at 1 or 5? But the first guess had E at 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position? That would be consistent with E being at 3 and also at 5? But wait, the first guess had E at position 5, and we got a dash, meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So if the secret word had two E's, one at 3 and one at 5, then when we guessed E at 5, we should have gotten a check mark? Because it would be correct? But we got a dash, meaning that at position 5, it is not E. Therefore, the secret word does not have E at position 5. Similarly, if there were two E's, the one at 5 would have been correct? But it wasn't. So the secret word has exactly one E, at position 3.

Similarly, for A: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and got a dash, meaning A is present but not at 3. In the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check mark. If there were two A's, then when we put A at position 4 and it was correct, but if there was another A at say position 1, then in the first guess when we put A at position 3, we might have gotten a dash for the A at position 3 (because it's not at 3) but the A at position 1 would be unaccounted for? Actually, in the first guess, we only have one A, so if the secret has two A's, then the feedback for the first guess would still show one dash for A? Because the A at position 3 is not correct, but there is an A elsewhere? But it doesn't indicate how many. Similarly, in the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check, so that A is correct. If there were another A, we wouldn't know.

But in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and got a dash, meaning that there is at least one A in the word, but not at 3. Then in the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check, meaning that there is an A at position 4. Now, if there were another A, say at position 1, then when we guessed ""crane"", we had no A at position 1? So the feedback wouldn't show anything for position 1? But we had C at position 1 which was absent, so no A at position 1? Actually, we don't know because we didn't test position 1 with A.

To clarify: the feedback for the first guess only tells us about the letters we guessed. For A, we guessed it at position 3 and got a dash, meaning that the secret has an A, but not at 3. It doesn't tell us about other positions. Similarly, for the second guess, we guessed A at position 4 and got a check, meaning that the secret has an A at position 4. Now, if the secret had two A's, we wouldn't have any direct evidence against it? But we also don't have evidence for it.

However, in the second guess, we also have the letter A at position 4, and we got a check. If there were an A at position 1, for example, we wouldn't know because we didn't guess a letter at position 1 that is A? We guessed B at position 1, which is absent.

So it's possible that the secret word has an A at position 1? But wait, we have A at position 4. If there were an A at position 1, then the word would have two A's. But we don't know.

Similarly for R: we have R at position 2, and we don't know if there is another R.

But for E: we have E at position 3, and we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5. Also, in the second guess, we didn't test E at other positions? We only had E at position 3. So if there were another E, it could be at position 1? But we don't know.

However, the first guess: when we guessed E at position 5, we got a dash, meaning that E is present but not at 5. That doesn't rule out E at position 1? Because we didn't test position 1. Similarly, the second guess: we didn't test position 1 for E? We had B at position 1.

So it's possible that the secret word has E at position 1? But we already have E at position 3? So that would be two E's? And we know E is at position 3, so if there is an E at position 1, then the word has two E's.

But let's reconsider the first guess: we guessed ""crane"" with E at position 5. The feedback for E was a dash, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. If the secret word had E at position 1 and E at position 3, then when we guessed E at position 5, it would be absent? No, because there is an E in the word? So it would be marked as present? But since it's not at position 5, it would be a dash? So that is consistent. Then, when we guessed ""bread"" with E at position 3, we got a check, meaning that E is at position 3. But if there is also an E at position 1, we wouldn't know because we didn't test position 1.

Similarly, for the second guess, we had no E at position 1? We had B at position 1, which is absent.

So it's possible that the secret word has an E at position 1? But then we would have two E's? And we also have A at position 4? And R at position 2? Then the word would be E R E A [letter5]? But we need to find letter5.

But we also know that the secret word must have five letters, and we have three confirmed: R, E, A. If there is an E at position 1, then we have E, R, E, A, and one more? So the letters would be E (twice), R, A, and one other? But we don't know.

This is getting complex. To simplify, let's first assume no duplicates. Then the secret word has distinct letters: R, E, A, and two others (say X and Y) at positions 1 and 5.

We know X and Y are not C, N, B, D.

Common letters left: S, T, L, O, U, M, P, H, G, K, etc.

Now, the word structure: [X] R E A [Y]

We need to guess a word that fits this pattern and tests possible X and Y.

But we don't have to stick to the pattern? We can guess any word? But we have three letters fixed: positions 2,3,4 are R, E, A. So we must have a word that has R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? And we are missing positions 1 and 5.

So the word must be of the form: ? R E A ?

We need to fill the first and last positions with letters that are not C, N, B, D, and that form a valid English word.

Possible words: 
- FREAK? F is not forbidden? But we don't know about F.
- TREAT? T is common? But T at position 1 and T at position 5? But we don't know about duplicates? But if we assume no duplicates, then ""TREAT"" has two T's? So not? 
- DREAM? But D is forbidden? We know D is absent? 
- CREAM? C is forbidden? 
- BREAK? B is forbidden? 
- GREAT? G is not forbidden? 
- WREAK? W is not forbidden? 

But we need to consider that we are guessing to get information. We already know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? So if we guess a word that has R at 2, E at 3, A at 4, then the feedback for positions 1 and 5 will tell us if the letters are correct or not? 

But we don't know what the letters are? So we need to test letters that are likely? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests new letters for positions 1 and 5.

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, N, B, D.

So let's list possible words ending with A? or not? 

Common words: 
- GREAT: G at 1, T at 5? 
- FREAK: F at 1, K at 5? 
- WREAK: W at 1, K at 5? 
- TREAT: T at 1, T at 5? (duplicate T) 
- PREPARE? Not 5 letters? 
- CREAK? C is forbidden? 
- STREAK? 6 letters? 

5-letter words: 
- AREA? Only 4 letters? 
- UREA? 4 letters? 

So: 
- GREAT: G and T? 
- FREAK: F and K? 
- WREAK: W and K? 
- TREAT: T and T? 
- BREAK: B is forbidden? 
- DREAD: D is forbidden? 

Also, ""PREYA""? Not a word? 

Another: ""UREAL""? Not common? 

""GREAT"" is a common word? 

But we don't know if G and T are in the word? 

We can guess ""GREAT"" to test G and T? 

If we guess ""GREAT"": 
- Position 1: G -> if correct, then G is at 1? Else, if absent, then G is not in the word? Or if present but wrong? But we have no other positions? So if G is not at 1, and if it's present, it would be at position 5? But position 5 is T? So if G is present, it must be at position 1? Because we have no other positions? So if we get G absent, then G is not in the word? Similarly for T at position 5: if T is at position 5, we get check? Else, if absent, then T is not in the word? Or if present but wrong position? But again, the only positions are 1 and 5? So if T is not at 5, and if it's present, it must be at position 1? But position 1 is G? So if we get T absent, then T is not in the word? 

But if we get G at position 1 as absent, but if the secret word has G at position 5? Then we would get T at position 5 as absent? But we are guessing T at position 5? So if the secret word has G at position 5, then when we guess T at position 5, we get absent? And G at position 1: we are guessing G, so if the secret has G at position 5, then G is present but not at position 1? So we would get a dash for G? 

Similarly, if the secret word has T at position 1, then we guess G at position 1: if G is not in the word, we get absent? And T at position 5: we guess T, but if the secret has T at position 1, then T is present but not at 5? So we get dash for T? 

Therefore, by guessing ""GREAT"", we can get information about G and T? 

But we also have other possibilities? For example, the secret word could be ""FREAK"" with F and K? Or ""WREAK"" with W and K? 

We need to choose a word that covers common letters? 

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that uses common letters for positions 1 and 5? 

Common letters for the first position: S, T, P, M, etc. 
Common letters for the last position: S, T, D, E, Y, etc. But E is already placed? 

But we know E is at 3, so not at 5? 

Common ending letters: S, T, Y, L, etc. 

So T is common? 

Also, S is very common? 

But we haven't tested S or T? 

So let's try to include S or T? 

But in ""GREAT"", we have T at the end? 

Another word: ""STREA"" not a word? 

""AREA"" is 4 letters? 

""UREA"" is 4? 

""CREAM"" has C? 

""STEAM"" doesn't have R at position 2? 

We need the pattern ? R E A ? 

So the word must have R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? 

So ""GREAT"" is one option? 

""TREAT"" is another? But has duplicate T? 

""FREAK"" is valid? 

""WREAK"" is valid? 

""PREP"" not 5? 

""OREAD""? ""OREAD"" is a word? Meaning a mountain nymph? But not common? 

""UREAL""? Not common? 

So common words: GREAT, FREAK, WREAK, TREAT? 

But TREAT has duplicate T? 

We can avoid duplicates? 

So among GREAT, FREAK, WREAK? 

GREAT has G and T? 
FREAK has F and K? 
WREAK has W and K? 

G, T, F, K, W are all possible? 

But T is more common than F, K, W? 

So ""GREAT"" might be a good guess? 

But we also have the possibility of duplicates? For example, the secret word could be ""AREA"" with 4 letters? No, 5 letters? 

Or ""UREAS""? Not? 

Another word: ""DREAR""? But D is forbidden? 

""BREAD"" we already guessed? 

So let's go with ""GREAT"". 

But we have to consider: if we guess ""GREAT"", and the secret word is ""FREAK"", then we will get: 
- G: absent? 
- R: correct? 
- E: correct? 
- A: correct? 
- T: absent? 

Then we know that position 1 is not G, and position 5 is not T? Then we can try ""FREAK"" next? 

Similarly, if the secret is ""WREAK"", we get similar feedback? 

But if the secret is ""GREAT"", we win? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses more common letters? But we are constrained by the fixed positions? 

Another idea: we can guess a word that doesn't necessarily have the fixed positions? But that might be inefficient? Because we know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? So we should use that? 

But we can also guess a word that tests other letters? For example, if we guess a word that has S or L? 

But we have to have R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? So we can't change that? 

Unless we want to test for duplicates? For example, if we guess a word that has an extra R or E or A? But we don't know. 

But let's not complicate? 

I think ""GREAT"" is a reasonable guess? 

But we have to make sure that G and T are not forbidden? We haven't used them? 

So let's guess ""GREAT"". 

But wait, what about the possibility of duplicates? For example, the secret word could be ""AREAE""? Not a word? Or ""UREAE""? Not? 

Common words with duplicates in this pattern? For example, ""TREAT"" has two T's? But we already considered? 

Or ""FREEE""? Not a word? 

So probably no common words with duplicates for this pattern? 

Therefore, I'll go with ""GREAT"". 

But let's confirm the feedback we would get for some possibilities:

- If secret is ""GREAT"": we get G✓, R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓ -> win.
- If secret is ""FREAK"": we get G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T(x) -> then we know it's not G or T, so next guess ""FREAK""?
- If secret is ""WREAK"": similarly, G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T(x) -> then we try ""WREAK""?
- If secret is ""TREAT"": we get G(x) for position 1? But we have T at position 1? So if we guess ""GREAT"", and secret is ""TREAT"", then:
   - G at position 1: absent? But T is at position 1? So we would get G(x) and T at position 5: we guess T, but secret has T at position 1 and 5? So at position 5, we have T? So we get T✓? 
   But wait: secret ""TREAT"": positions: T, R, E, A, T.
   Guess ""GREAT"": G, R, E, A, T.
   Feedback:
      Position 1: G vs T -> not match, and G is not in the secret? So absent (x)? 
      Position 2: R vs R -> ✓
      Position 3: E vs E -> ✓
      Position 4: A vs A -> ✓
      Position 5: T vs T -> ✓
   So we get: G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓ -> but we have four checks? But the secret has T at position 1? We didn't guess T at position 1? We guessed G? So we don't get any indication of T at position 1? 

   Then we would think that the word is ? R E A T, and we have G(x) so position 1 is not G? Then we might guess ""TREAT"" next? 

But we have T at position 5 correct? So the word ends with T? And we know positions 2,3,4 are R,E,A? So the word is ? R E A T? 

Then we need to find the first letter? It could be T? Or F? Or W? etc? 

But we know from the feedback that G is absent? So position 1 is not G? 

Then we can try ""TREAT"": 
   T at 1: if correct, then T✓, and we have T at 5? But we already know T at 5 is correct? 
   But if we guess ""TREAT"", we get T✓, R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓? 

But we already have four checks? 

After ""GREAT"" with feedback G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓, we know the word is ?REAT? with the last letter T? And the first letter is not G? 

Then we can guess words like ""TREAT"" (if we think duplicate T), or ""FREAT"" not a word? 

Common words: only ""TREAT"" and ""GREAT"" and ""WREAT"" not? 

""TREAT"" is the only common one? 

But we already guessed ""GREAT"" and got T at 5 correct? So the secret must be one of the words ending with T? 

But in English, 5-letter words with pattern ?REAT: 
- GREAT
- TREAT
- WREAT? Not common? 
- CREAT? Not? 

So only GREAT and TREAT? 

And we know it's not GREAT because we got G absent? So it must be TREAT? 

So we can guess TREAT next? 

But we have only one guess left? We have used two guesses? We have up to six? 

But in this case, after ""GREAT"" with G(x) and T✓, we can deduce TREAT? 

Similarly, if we get G(x) and T(x), then it might be FREAK or WREAK? 

So ""GREAT"" is a good guess? 

But we have to consider that the secret might have other letters? For example, ""DREAM"" but D is forbidden? 

Or ""BREAK"" B forbidden? 

Or ""STREAK"" 6 letters? 

So I think ""GREAT"" is a good choice. 

Therefore, I'll guess ""GREAT"". 

But let's see the feedback we have: we know A is at 4, E at 3, R at 2? So the word is ?REA? 

And we are guessing ""GREAT"" to test G and T? 

Yes. 

So <guess>great</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → C(absent), R(correct), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(present but wrong position)
- **Guess 2: bread** → B(absent), R(correct), E(correct), A(correct), D(absent)

### Key Insights:
1. **R** is confirmed at **position 2**.
2. **E** is confirmed at **position 3**.
3. **A** is confirmed at **position 4**.
4. **C, N, B, D** are absent (not in the word).
5. The secret word has the structure: `[letter1] R E A [letter5]`.
6. **letter1** and **letter5** must be:
   - Letters not yet tested or ruled out (e.g., common letters like S, T, L, G, F, W, K).
   - Not C, N, B, or D (absent per feedback).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test high-frequency letters for positions 1 and 5 (e.g., **G** and **T**) to maximize information.
- Use a valid word that fits the known structure (`?REA?`) and includes plausible letters.
- **GREAT** is ideal because:
  - It tests **G** at position 1 (common starting letter).
  - It tests **T** at position 5 (common ending letter).
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, N, B, D).
  - Feedback will directly reveal if **G** or **T** are correct/absent, narrowing possibilities significantly (e.g., to words like `TREAT`, `FREAK`, or `WREAK` if not `GREAT`).

Since there is no prior feedback, we need a good starting word.\n A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.\n Common letters in English include vowels (A,E,I,O,U) and frequent consonants (R,S,T,L,N, etc.).\n Some popular starting words are ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", etc. We\'ll choose one that balances common letters and frequency.\n\n Let\'s choose ""ROATE"". Why?\n - It has relatively common letters: R, O, A, T, E.\n - It contains three vowels (O, A, E) and two common consonants (R, T).\n\n However, note that the rules require 5-letter English words. ""ROATE"" is a valid word (it is a financial term meaning the profit from an investment).\n\n We\'ll go with ""ROATE"".\n\n If the user says we cannot use this word, we might pick another, but for now, let\'s use it.\n\n Thus, our first guess: ROATE.For the first guess, I need to choose a word that maximizes the potential information gain. A good starting word typically includes common vowels and consonants to cover frequent letters. After considering options, ""CRANE"" is a strong choice because:\n- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).\n- C, R, A, N, and E are all highly frequent in English words.\n- This combination helps test multiple letter positions broadly.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(-)\n Interpretation:\n - R is in the word and in the correct position (position 2, since the word is 1-based: position 1=C, 2=R, 3=A, 4=N, 5=E).\n - A is in the word but in the wrong position. Since we placed A at position 3, it must be elsewhere (either position 1, 4, or 5? but positions are fixed). Actually, A could be in positions 1, 4, or 5? Note: the word is 5 letters, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But A is not in position 3 because we got a dash (meaning wrong position). Also, we know position 2 is R (correct).\n - E is in the word but in the wrong position (so not at position 5? because we placed it at position 5 and got dash). Similarly, E must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4? But not position 2 because that is R (which is fixed).\n - C and N are not in the word at all.\n\n So what we know:\n - The second letter is R (position 2).\n - The word contains A and E, but not at the positions we guessed: \n      A is not at position 3 (because we got dash for wrong position), \n      E is not at position 5 (because we got dash).\n - The word does not contain C or N.\n\n Also, since A is in the word but not at position 3, and E is in the word but not at position 5, we must place them elsewhere.\n\n Possible positions for A: must be in positions 1, 4, or 5? But note: position 2 is taken by R, so A cannot be there. Similarly, for E: positions 1, 3, or 4? Because position 2 is R.\n\n However, we must also consider that the word has exactly 5 letters and we know one letter (R at position 2).\n\n Therefore, the secret word has the form: [letter1] R [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n And we know:\n - letter1, letter3, letter4, letter5 are unknown.\n - The word includes A and E (each exactly once? but we don\'t know if there are duplicates). However, without more info, we assume unique unless proven otherwise.\n\n Also, we know that A is not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 4, or 5) and E is not at position 5 (so it must be at position 1, 3, or 4).\n\n Since C and N are out, we avoid those letters.\n\n We have two new letters to place: A and E.\n\n Strategy for the next guess:\n - We want to confirm the positions of A and E, and also test other common letters.\n - We know the word has R in the middle, and includes A and E.\n\n Consider possible words. For example, words that have R in the second position.\n\n We also know that our guess must be a valid 5-letter word.\n\n Let\'s list some possibilities? But we don\'t need to list all; we need a word that includes A and E in different positions and avoids C and N, and also introduces new letters to gather more information.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tested: we haven\'t used S, T, L, O, D, H, etc.\n\n We should aim to test A and E in new positions and cover unknown spots.\n\n How about placing A at position 1 or 4 or 5? And E at position 1, 3, or 4? But note: we can\'t put E at position 5? because we know it\'s not there (from feedback: dash for E at position 5 means E is present but not there).\n\n For our next guess, let\'s try to put A in a position that we don\'t know yet, and similarly for E.\n\n What positions are still unknown? All except position 2.\n\n We are going to test A at position 1? But then we can\'t test E at position 1? So maybe we put A at position 1 and E at position 3? Or A at position 4 and E at position 3? etc.\n\n But note: if we put A at position 1 and E at position 3, then the word would be: A R [E?] [new] [new]. However, we know that A cannot be at position 3? from the previous feedback? Actually, the feedback for A was dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 3. So putting A at position 1 would be a valid test.\n\n Alternatively, to cover more ground, we might use a word that has A and E in the remaining possible positions and some new common letters.\n\n Top idea: use the word ""RADAR""? But that has two R\'s? We already have R fixed at position 2. Also, we are avoiding duplicate letters? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know. However, let\'s choose a word without duplicates to avoid complexity? But ""RADAR"" duplicates R and A? So not ideal.\n\n Another idea: word with second letter R and including A and E? Let\'s think.\n\n Possible words: \n - ""ARISE"": this has A at position 1, R at position 2? That matches. Then I at position 3? But we don\'t know about I. Then S at 4, E at 5? But note: we had E at position 5 in the first guess and got dash? That means if the secret word has E at position 5, then in the first guess we would have gotten E as dash? Actually, no: we guessed crane -> E at position 5 was marked dash meaning E is present but not at position 5. So if we put E at position 5 in a new guess, that would be invalid? But wait: the secret word could have E at position 5? No, because the feedback for E was dash meaning it is in the word but not at that position (so not at 5). Hence, E cannot be at position 5 in the secret word. Therefore, we shouldn\'t put E at position 5 in our guess if we want to test other possibilities? Actually, we can put E anywhere but we know now that in the secret word E is not at position 5.\n\n So in ""ARISE"":\n   Position 1: A -> but we know A is in the word? Yes. And we know from first guess that A is not at position 3. Now we put it at position 1: if it becomes correct then we know A is at position 1, else if dash then it exists but we know it\'s not at position 1? This would help.\n   Position 2: R -> we know it\'s correct so we\'ll get check mark no matter what? Actually, we already know it\'s correct so we must put R at position 2.\n   Position 3: I -> new letter.\n   Position 4: S -> new letter.\n   Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at position 5? Because the feedback for the first guess said E is not at position 5. So putting E at position 5 in our guess: if the secret word had E at position 5, we would not have gotten the dash? So if we get a dash for E at position 5 again? It would be inconsistent? Actually, from the feedback of the first guess: the secret word has E, but not at position 5. So if we guess E at position 5 and we get a dash, it would confirm that the secret word does not have E at position 5 (which we already know) and if we get a cross? We would get a cross only if E is not present? but we know E is present? So if we put E at a position 5 and we get a dash, that wouldn\'t be possible? Because the dash means it is present but not here? But we know the secret word has E? So actually, if we put E at position 5 we should get either:\n      - a cross: but that would contradict the first feedback? because the first feedback said we have E? So we cannot get a cross? \n      - a dash: meaning E is present but not at position 5? That is what we already know.\n\n But in fact, we know E is present? So if we put E at position 5, the feedback must be a dash? Because we know the secret word does have an E, and we\'re placing it at position 5? Then it must be that the secret word\'s E is not at position 5? So we\'ll get dash? And we learn nothing new? \n\n Why test that? It wastes a slot. Therefore, we shouldn\'t put E at position 5 because we already know that position 5 is not E.\n\n Similarly, we know A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3? Then we must get a dash? But we already know it\'s not at position 3? So we would get dash? Then we learn nothing? \n\n So we should put A and E at positions that we don\'t know? So for A: positions 1, 4, and 5 are possible? For E: positions 1, 3, and 4 are possible? But note: in one word we can test A at one of these and E at one of these? But also we need to test other letters.\n\n Since we have a known letter R at position 2, let\'s choose a word that:\n - Has R at position 2.\n - Places A at either position 1, 4, or 5 (we pick one we haven\'t eliminated).\n - Places E at either position 1, 3, or 4 (but avoiding positions where A is? unless same).\n\n We need to avoid the known bad positions? So don\'t put A at position 3? And don\'t put E at position 5? But that\'s automatic because we are going to put them elsewhere.\n\n To maximize information, let\'s put A at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we test two new letters? And we leave position 3 and 5 for new letters? \n\n Example word: ""A R E S T"" -> ""AREST""? Not a word? \n\n ""A R E A L""? ""AREAL"": valid word? But it has two A\'s? We don\'t want duplicates? We don\'t know the secret word has duplicates? So avoid?\n\n ""A R E S"" — wait position 4? Need letter for position 4? And position 5? The word would be ""AR?E?"".\n\n How about ""AROSE""?\n   A at 1, R at 2, O at 3, S at 4, E at 5? But E at position 5? We\'ve been told that E is not at position 5? Why guess it again? \n\n Let me think: the secret word doesn\'t have E at position 5? So in ""AROSE"", we are putting E at position 5 which we know is incorrect? Then we will get a dash for E? That\'s redundant? And A is at position 1? That might be new.\n\n So let\'s avoid E at position 5. Then we must put E at position 1? But position 1 would be both A and E? No, we can choose only one? \n\n We can put E at position 3? Then the word format: [E at position 3]? \n\n Or we put E at position 4? Then we don\'t test position 5 for E? Because we know position 5 is not E? \n\n So let me look for words that:\n   Position 1: A? \n   Position 2: R (fixed)\n   Position 3: E? Or E should be elsewhere? But E can\'t be at position 5? And if we put E at position 3, that would be testing a position that A was (but A at 3 was wrong)? It is valid? Actually, we have no feedback for position 3? We only know that A is not at position 3? But E might be at position 3? \n\n So possible word: ""A R E E S""? Not? \n\n Alternatively: put A at position 4? Then word structure: [?] R [?] A [?]\n\n And E at position 3? Then: [new1] R E A [new2]\n\n Example: word ""BREA?"": ""BREAD"" -> but E is at position 3? \n But: ""BREAD"": \n   Position 1: B\n   Position 2: R -> correct\n   Position 3: E -> we put E at 3? \n   Position 4: A\n   Position 5: D\n\n But note: we have A and E: A is at position 4? And E at position 3? This is good because we are testing A and E in new positions.\n\n And we avoid any known problem? Also, we are introducing B and D? Which are not tested? But we haven\'t been told anything about B and D? So we test them.\n\n Therefore, I suggest ""BREAD"".\n\n But let\'s see: \n - We know R is correct at 2.\n - If A is in the word? We put A at position 4: if we get check mark? Then A is at 4? Else, if dash? Then A is not at 4? Then must be at position 1 or 5? \n - Similarly, E at position 3: if we get check mark? Then E is at 3? Else, if dash? Then E is elsewhere? \n - We also get feedback for B and D? \n\n Alternatively, we might choose ""PARED"": \n   P at 1, A at 3? But wait, we know A is not at position 3? So we shouldn\'t put A at 3? Because it will definitely give a dash? Then not helpful? \n\n So ""BREAD"" seems valid? Let me check if ""bread"" is a valid word? Yes? It\'s common.\n\n Another candidate: ""TRADE""? \n   T at 1, R at 2, A at 3? But wait: we know A is not at position 3? Therefore, if we put ""TRADE"": \n      Position 1: T\n      Position 2: R -> ✓\n      Position 3: A -> we should definitely get dash? Because we know A is not at 3? So if we get dash? We don\'t learn anything? \n      Position 4: D\n      Position 5: E -> but we know E is not at 5? So we get dash? \n\n Then we waste two positions: A at 3 (already known to be wrong) and E at 5 (already known wrong) -> inefficient? \n\n Therefore, avoid placing A at any position we know it\'s not? And avoid E at any position we know it\'s not? \n\n So ""TRADE"" is bad? \n\n Let\'s choose ""BREAD"": \n   B at position 1: new? \n   R at 2: ✓\n   E at 3: test this position? We don\'t know where E is? \n   A at 4: test? Because we don\'t know if A is at 4?\n   D at 5: new? \n\n Since we know E is not at 5? But we are putting D at 5? So that\'s okay? \n\n This seems efficient? \n\n However, note: we were told that A is in the word? So if A is at position 4? Then we\'ll get ✓ for A? \n We were told that E is in the word? So if E is at position 3? Then we get ✓ for E? \n\n But what if E is actually not at 3? Then we get dash for E? And we know E must be at positions 1 or 4? But position 4 is A? So then E could only be at position 1? Or position 4? But wait, if we are putting A at 4, then E cannot be at 4? So then E must be at position 1? Or if duplicates? We avoid duplicates? \n\n So we are introducing new letters: B and D? \n\n Let\'s consider: \n - If E is not at position 3? Then after this guess we will see E at position 3 marked as dash? Then we know E must be somewhere else? And then we try position 1? Or we can deduce.\n\n Similarly, if A is not at position 4? Then we get dash? And we know A must be at position 1 or 5? \n\n This guess will help us quickly pin down positions? \n\n Therefore, I choose ""BREAD"" as the next guess.\n\n But wait: what about introducing more new common letters? We also have the option to use letters like S, T, L, etc? \n\n In ""BREAD"": letters B, R, E, A, D? We already have R, E, A? And we add B and D? B is less common? We could use T, S, L, etc? \n\n Alternatively, how about ""SUPER""? Not second letter R? \n\n Or ""GRAVE""? \n   G at 1? \n   R at 2: ✓\n   A at 3? But we know A is not at 3? -> so bad? \n\n Or ""PARSE"": \n   P at 1, A at 3? again A at 3 -> bad? \n\n So I stick with ""BREAD"".\n\n Another candidate: ""TRACE""? But C is blacklisted? We know C is not in the word? So we cannot use letters C? And also N is not? So avoid C and N? \n\n Therefore, ""BREAD"" is valid? \n\n Let me check: \n   We know C and N are not in the word? So we avoid B? Why B? Because it hasn\'t been tested? It\'s not forbidden? \n\n We can also choose ""BRAKE""? \n   B at 1,\n   R at 2 -> ✓,\n   A at 3? Wait: we know A is not at 3? Then we must get dash? So we waste A? \n   K at 4? \n   E at 5? But E at 5: we know E is not at 5? So we must get dash? \n   So two dashes: the same as above? Only we test K? \n\n Then we\'d be equally? But ""BREAD"" tests two letters? \n\n How about ""OPERA""? \n   O at 1? \n   P at 2? But position 2 must be R? So we must put R at position 2? \n\n So we must have second letter R? So ""OPERA"" doesn\'t have R at position 2? \n\n Hence, I\'ll go with ""BREAD"".\n\n Final decision: guess ""BREAD""\n\n But note: ""BREAD"" is the word? And we hope to get feedback that will clarify positions of A and E?Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane"" → C(x), R(✓), A(-), N(x), E(-)), we know:\n- **R** is in the correct position (position 2).\n- **A** is in the word but not in position 3.\n- **E** is in the word but not in position 5.\n- **C** and **N** are absent.\n\nFor the next guess, we prioritize:\n- Retaining **R** in position 2.\n- Testing **A** and **E** in new possible positions (A not at 3, E not at 5).\n- Introducing new common letters like **B** and **D** to gain additional information.\n\nThe word **""BREAD""** fits perfectly:\n- B at position 1 (new letter test).\n- R at position 2 (known correct).\n- E at position 3 (tests if E is here).\n- A at position 4 (tests if A is here).\n- D at position 5 (new letter test).\n\nThis avoids redundant guesses and efficiently narrows possibilities for A, E, and new letters.\n\n<guess>bread</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: bread -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) E(✓) A(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: absent (x)\n- R: correct (✓) at position 2\n- A: present but wrong position (-) -> so A is in the word, but not at position 3\n- N: absent (x)\n- E: present but wrong position (-) -> so E is in the word, but not at position 5\n\nGuess 2: ""bread""\n- B: absent (x)\n- R: correct (✓) at position 2 (as before)\n- E: correct (✓) at position 3 -> so E is at position 3\n- A: correct (✓) at position 4 -> so A is at position 4\n- D: absent (x)\n\nNow, combining the information:\n\n1. Position 2 is R (from both guesses).\n2. Position 3 is E (from second guess: E is correct at position 3).\n3. Position 4 is A (from second guess: A is correct at position 4).\n\nWe also know:\n- From the first guess, A was not at position 3 (which is consistent because now we know it\'s at 4) and E was not at position 5 (which is consistent because we now know E is at 3, not 5).\n- The secret word has the form: [letter1] R E A [letter5]\n\nWe also know that C, N, B, and D are absent (from the x\'s).\n\nWe need to find the first and fifth letters.\n\nConstraints:\n- The first letter cannot be C, N, B, or D (since they are absent).\n- The fifth letter cannot be C, N, B, D, or E (because E is at position 3, and we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5, which is consistent). Also, note that E is already placed at 3, so it can\'t be at 5.\n\nAdditionally, we know from the first guess that the word contains A and E (which we\'ve placed) and R (placed). But are there any other letters? The first guess had five letters: C, R, A, N, E. We know C and N are absent, so the only letters present were R, A, E. Similarly, the second guess had B, R, E, A, D. We know B and D are absent, so again, only R, E, A are present? But wait, the secret word has five letters. We have three letters: R, E, A. So we are missing two: one at position 1 and one at position 5.\n\nBut note: the feedback from the first guess said that A and E are present (but in wrong positions) and R is correct. It didn\'t say anything about other letters? Actually, the first guess had five letters, and we got:\n- C: absent\n- R: correct\n- A: present (but wrong position)\n- N: absent\n- E: present (but wrong position)\n\nSo the secret word must contain R, A, E, and two other letters that are not C or N. Similarly, the second guess: B and D are absent, so the secret word does not contain B or D.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has:\n- Position 1: a letter that is not C, N, B, D, and not R, A, E (since those are already placed? but R, A, E are at positions 2,4,3, so they could be duplicated? But we don\'t know. However, the feedback from the first guess: when we guessed ""crane"", we had A and E marked as present, but if there were duplicates, we might not have seen it? The standard Wordle rules: if a letter is duplicated in the guess but not in the secret, it might show as absent for the extra ones. But in this case, we don\'t have duplicates in the guesses.\n\nTo be safe, we should not assume duplicates unless necessary. Since we have three confirmed letters (R, E, A) and two positions to fill, and the word has five letters, it\'s possible that there are duplicates? But we haven\'t seen any indication of duplicates so far.\n\nGiven the feedback, let\'s see if duplicates are possible:\n\n- In the first guess, we had one A and one E, and both were marked as present (but wrong positions). If the secret had two A\'s, for example, then if we guessed one A in the wrong position, it would still show as present. Similarly for E. But we don\'t have evidence for duplicates.\n\nMoreover, in the second guess, we had one E and one A, and they were both marked correct at positions 3 and 4. If the secret had duplicates, then if we guessed only one, we might not see the duplicate? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, without evidence, it\'s simpler to assume no duplicates for now.\n\nSo, the secret word has exactly the letters: R, E, A, and two other letters (say X and Y) at positions 1 and 5.\n\nWe know that X (position 1) and Y (position 5) are not C, N, B, D.\n\nAlso, they cannot be R, E, A? Because if they were, then we would have duplicates? But we don\'t know. Let\'s not rule out duplicates entirely.\n\nBut note: if position 1 were R, that would be duplicate R? But we have R at position 2. Similarly, if position 1 were E, but we have E at position 3? Or position 5 were A? But we have A at position 4.\n\nBut in the feedback for the second guess, we have:\n- B: absent -> so no B\n- R: correct at 2 -> so R is at 2, and if there were another R, it might be at position 1 or 5? But we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, for E: we have E at 3, so if there were another E, it could be at 1 or 5? But the first guess had E at 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position? That would be consistent with E being at 3 and also at 5? But wait, the first guess had E at position 5, and we got a dash, meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So if the secret word had two E\'s, one at 3 and one at 5, then when we guessed E at 5, we should have gotten a check mark? Because it would be correct? But we got a dash, meaning that at position 5, it is not E. Therefore, the secret word does not have E at position 5. Similarly, if there were two E\'s, the one at 5 would have been correct? But it wasn\'t. So the secret word has exactly one E, at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, for A: in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and got a dash, meaning A is present but not at 3. In the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check mark. If there were two A\'s, then when we put A at position 4 and it was correct, but if there was another A at say position 1, then in the first guess when we put A at position 3, we might have gotten a dash for the A at position 3 (because it\'s not at 3) but the A at position 1 would be unaccounted for? Actually, in the first guess, we only have one A, so if the secret has two A\'s, then the feedback for the first guess would still show one dash for A? Because the A at position 3 is not correct, but there is an A elsewhere? But it doesn\'t indicate how many. Similarly, in the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check, so that A is correct. If there were another A, we wouldn\'t know.\n\nBut in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and got a dash, meaning that there is at least one A in the word, but not at 3. Then in the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check, meaning that there is an A at position 4. Now, if there were another A, say at position 1, then when we guessed ""crane"", we had no A at position 1? So the feedback wouldn\'t show anything for position 1? But we had C at position 1 which was absent, so no A at position 1? Actually, we don\'t know because we didn\'t test position 1 with A.\n\nTo clarify: the feedback for the first guess only tells us about the letters we guessed. For A, we guessed it at position 3 and got a dash, meaning that the secret has an A, but not at 3. It doesn\'t tell us about other positions. Similarly, for the second guess, we guessed A at position 4 and got a check, meaning that the secret has an A at position 4. Now, if the secret had two A\'s, we wouldn\'t have any direct evidence against it? But we also don\'t have evidence for it.\n\nHowever, in the second guess, we also have the letter A at position 4, and we got a check. If there were an A at position 1, for example, we wouldn\'t know because we didn\'t guess a letter at position 1 that is A? We guessed B at position 1, which is absent.\n\nSo it\'s possible that the secret word has an A at position 1? But wait, we have A at position 4. If there were an A at position 1, then the word would have two A\'s. But we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly for R: we have R at position 2, and we don\'t know if there is another R.\n\nBut for E: we have E at position 3, and we know from the first guess that E is not at position 5. Also, in the second guess, we didn\'t test E at other positions? We only had E at position 3. So if there were another E, it could be at position 1? But we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, the first guess: when we guessed E at position 5, we got a dash, meaning that E is present but not at 5. That doesn\'t rule out E at position 1? Because we didn\'t test position 1. Similarly, the second guess: we didn\'t test position 1 for E? We had B at position 1.\n\nSo it\'s possible that the secret word has E at position 1? But we already have E at position 3? So that would be two E\'s? And we know E is at position 3, so if there is an E at position 1, then the word has two E\'s.\n\nBut let\'s reconsider the first guess: we guessed ""crane"" with E at position 5. The feedback for E was a dash, meaning that E is in the word but not at position 5. If the secret word had E at position 1 and E at position 3, then when we guessed E at position 5, it would be absent? No, because there is an E in the word? So it would be marked as present? But since it\'s not at position 5, it would be a dash? So that is consistent. Then, when we guessed ""bread"" with E at position 3, we got a check, meaning that E is at position 3. But if there is also an E at position 1, we wouldn\'t know because we didn\'t test position 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the second guess, we had no E at position 1? We had B at position 1, which is absent.\n\nSo it\'s possible that the secret word has an E at position 1? But then we would have two E\'s? And we also have A at position 4? And R at position 2? Then the word would be E R E A [letter5]? But we need to find letter5.\n\nBut we also know that the secret word must have five letters, and we have three confirmed: R, E, A. If there is an E at position 1, then we have E, R, E, A, and one more? So the letters would be E (twice), R, A, and one other? But we don\'t know.\n\nThis is getting complex. To simplify, let\'s first assume no duplicates. Then the secret word has distinct letters: R, E, A, and two others (say X and Y) at positions 1 and 5.\n\nWe know X and Y are not C, N, B, D.\n\nCommon letters left: S, T, L, O, U, M, P, H, G, K, etc.\n\nNow, the word structure: [X] R E A [Y]\n\nWe need to guess a word that fits this pattern and tests possible X and Y.\n\nBut we don\'t have to stick to the pattern? We can guess any word? But we have three letters fixed: positions 2,3,4 are R, E, A. So we must have a word that has R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? And we are missing positions 1 and 5.\n\nSo the word must be of the form: ? R E A ?\n\nWe need to fill the first and last positions with letters that are not C, N, B, D, and that form a valid English word.\n\nPossible words: \n- FREAK? F is not forbidden? But we don\'t know about F.\n- TREAT? T is common? But T at position 1 and T at position 5? But we don\'t know about duplicates? But if we assume no duplicates, then ""TREAT"" has two T\'s? So not? \n- DREAM? But D is forbidden? We know D is absent? \n- CREAM? C is forbidden? \n- BREAK? B is forbidden? \n- GREAT? G is not forbidden? \n- WREAK? W is not forbidden? \n\nBut we need to consider that we are guessing to get information. We already know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? So if we guess a word that has R at 2, E at 3, A at 4, then the feedback for positions 1 and 5 will tell us if the letters are correct or not? \n\nBut we don\'t know what the letters are? So we need to test letters that are likely? \n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests new letters for positions 1 and 5.\n\nBut we have to avoid the forbidden letters: C, N, B, D.\n\nSo let\'s list possible words ending with A? or not? \n\nCommon words: \n- GREAT: G at 1, T at 5? \n- FREAK: F at 1, K at 5? \n- WREAK: W at 1, K at 5? \n- TREAT: T at 1, T at 5? (duplicate T) \n- PREPARE? Not 5 letters? \n- CREAK? C is forbidden? \n- STREAK? 6 letters? \n\n5-letter words: \n- AREA? Only 4 letters? \n- UREA? 4 letters? \n\nSo: \n- GREAT: G and T? \n- FREAK: F and K? \n- WREAK: W and K? \n- TREAT: T and T? \n- BREAK: B is forbidden? \n- DREAD: D is forbidden? \n\nAlso, ""PREYA""? Not a word? \n\nAnother: ""UREAL""? Not common? \n\n""GREAT"" is a common word? \n\nBut we don\'t know if G and T are in the word? \n\nWe can guess ""GREAT"" to test G and T? \n\nIf we guess ""GREAT"": \n- Position 1: G -> if correct, then G is at 1? Else, if absent, then G is not in the word? Or if present but wrong? But we have no other positions? So if G is not at 1, and if it\'s present, it would be at position 5? But position 5 is T? So if G is present, it must be at position 1? Because we have no other positions? So if we get G absent, then G is not in the word? Similarly for T at position 5: if T is at position 5, we get check? Else, if absent, then T is not in the word? Or if present but wrong position? But again, the only positions are 1 and 5? So if T is not at 5, and if it\'s present, it must be at position 1? But position 1 is G? So if we get T absent, then T is not in the word? \n\nBut if we get G at position 1 as absent, but if the secret word has G at position 5? Then we would get T at position 5 as absent? But we are guessing T at position 5? So if the secret word has G at position 5, then when we guess T at position 5, we get absent? And G at position 1: we are guessing G, so if the secret has G at position 5, then G is present but not at position 1? So we would get a dash for G? \n\nSimilarly, if the secret word has T at position 1, then we guess G at position 1: if G is not in the word, we get absent? And T at position 5: we guess T, but if the secret has T at position 1, then T is present but not at 5? So we get dash for T? \n\nTherefore, by guessing ""GREAT"", we can get information about G and T? \n\nBut we also have other possibilities? For example, the secret word could be ""FREAK"" with F and K? Or ""WREAK"" with W and K? \n\nWe need to choose a word that covers common letters? \n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that uses common letters for positions 1 and 5? \n\nCommon letters for the first position: S, T, P, M, etc. \nCommon letters for the last position: S, T, D, E, Y, etc. But E is already placed? \n\nBut we know E is at 3, so not at 5? \n\nCommon ending letters: S, T, Y, L, etc. \n\nSo T is common? \n\nAlso, S is very common? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested S or T? \n\nSo let\'s try to include S or T? \n\nBut in ""GREAT"", we have T at the end? \n\nAnother word: ""STREA"" not a word? \n\n""AREA"" is 4 letters? \n\n""UREA"" is 4? \n\n""CREAM"" has C? \n\n""STEAM"" doesn\'t have R at position 2? \n\nWe need the pattern ? R E A ? \n\nSo the word must have R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? \n\nSo ""GREAT"" is one option? \n\n""TREAT"" is another? But has duplicate T? \n\n""FREAK"" is valid? \n\n""WREAK"" is valid? \n\n""PREP"" not 5? \n\n""OREAD""? ""OREAD"" is a word? Meaning a mountain nymph? But not common? \n\n""UREAL""? Not common? \n\nSo common words: GREAT, FREAK, WREAK, TREAT? \n\nBut TREAT has duplicate T? \n\nWe can avoid duplicates? \n\nSo among GREAT, FREAK, WREAK? \n\nGREAT has G and T? \nFREAK has F and K? \nWREAK has W and K? \n\nG, T, F, K, W are all possible? \n\nBut T is more common than F, K, W? \n\nSo ""GREAT"" might be a good guess? \n\nBut we also have the possibility of duplicates? For example, the secret word could be ""AREA"" with 4 letters? No, 5 letters? \n\nOr ""UREAS""? Not? \n\nAnother word: ""DREAR""? But D is forbidden? \n\n""BREAD"" we already guessed? \n\nSo let\'s go with ""GREAT"". \n\nBut we have to consider: if we guess ""GREAT"", and the secret word is ""FREAK"", then we will get: \n- G: absent? \n- R: correct? \n- E: correct? \n- A: correct? \n- T: absent? \n\nThen we know that position 1 is not G, and position 5 is not T? Then we can try ""FREAK"" next? \n\nSimilarly, if the secret is ""WREAK"", we get similar feedback? \n\nBut if the secret is ""GREAT"", we win? \n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that uses more common letters? But we are constrained by the fixed positions? \n\nAnother idea: we can guess a word that doesn\'t necessarily have the fixed positions? But that might be inefficient? Because we know positions 2,3,4 are fixed? So we should use that? \n\nBut we can also guess a word that tests other letters? For example, if we guess a word that has S or L? \n\nBut we have to have R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? So we can\'t change that? \n\nUnless we want to test for duplicates? For example, if we guess a word that has an extra R or E or A? But we don\'t know. \n\nBut let\'s not complicate? \n\nI think ""GREAT"" is a reasonable guess? \n\nBut we have to make sure that G and T are not forbidden? We haven\'t used them? \n\nSo let\'s guess ""GREAT"". \n\nBut wait, what about the possibility of duplicates? For example, the secret word could be ""AREAE""? Not a word? Or ""UREAE""? Not? \n\nCommon words with duplicates in this pattern? For example, ""TREAT"" has two T\'s? But we already considered? \n\nOr ""FREEE""? Not a word? \n\nSo probably no common words with duplicates for this pattern? \n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""GREAT"". \n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we would get for some possibilities:\n\n- If secret is ""GREAT"": we get G✓, R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓ -> win.\n- If secret is ""FREAK"": we get G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T(x) -> then we know it\'s not G or T, so next guess ""FREAK""?\n- If secret is ""WREAK"": similarly, G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T(x) -> then we try ""WREAK""?\n- If secret is ""TREAT"": we get G(x) for position 1? But we have T at position 1? So if we guess ""GREAT"", and secret is ""TREAT"", then:\n   - G at position 1: absent? But T is at position 1? So we would get G(x) and T at position 5: we guess T, but secret has T at position 1 and 5? So at position 5, we have T? So we get T✓? \n   But wait: secret ""TREAT"": positions: T, R, E, A, T.\n   Guess ""GREAT"": G, R, E, A, T.\n   Feedback:\n      Position 1: G vs T -> not match, and G is not in the secret? So absent (x)? \n      Position 2: R vs R -> ✓\n      Position 3: E vs E -> ✓\n      Position 4: A vs A -> ✓\n      Position 5: T vs T -> ✓\n   So we get: G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓ -> but we have four checks? But the secret has T at position 1? We didn\'t guess T at position 1? We guessed G? So we don\'t get any indication of T at position 1? \n\n   Then we would think that the word is ? R E A T, and we have G(x) so position 1 is not G? Then we might guess ""TREAT"" next? \n\nBut we have T at position 5 correct? So the word ends with T? And we know positions 2,3,4 are R,E,A? So the word is ? R E A T? \n\nThen we need to find the first letter? It could be T? Or F? Or W? etc? \n\nBut we know from the feedback that G is absent? So position 1 is not G? \n\nThen we can try ""TREAT"": \n   T at 1: if correct, then T✓, and we have T at 5? But we already know T at 5 is correct? \n   But if we guess ""TREAT"", we get T✓, R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓? \n\nBut we already have four checks? \n\nAfter ""GREAT"" with feedback G(x), R✓, E✓, A✓, T✓, we know the word is ?REAT? with the last letter T? And the first letter is not G? \n\nThen we can guess words like ""TREAT"" (if we think duplicate T), or ""FREAT"" not a word? \n\nCommon words: only ""TREAT"" and ""GREAT"" and ""WREAT"" not? \n\n""TREAT"" is the only common one? \n\nBut we already guessed ""GREAT"" and got T at 5 correct? So the secret must be one of the words ending with T? \n\nBut in English, 5-letter words with pattern ?REAT: \n- GREAT\n- TREAT\n- WREAT? Not common? \n- CREAT? Not? \n\nSo only GREAT and TREAT? \n\nAnd we know it\'s not GREAT because we got G absent? So it must be TREAT? \n\nSo we can guess TREAT next? \n\nBut we have only one guess left? We have used two guesses? We have up to six? \n\nBut in this case, after ""GREAT"" with G(x) and T✓, we can deduce TREAT? \n\nSimilarly, if we get G(x) and T(x), then it might be FREAK or WREAK? \n\nSo ""GREAT"" is a good guess? \n\nBut we have to consider that the secret might have other letters? For example, ""DREAM"" but D is forbidden? \n\nOr ""BREAK"" B forbidden? \n\nOr ""STREAK"" 6 letters? \n\nSo I think ""GREAT"" is a good choice. \n\nTherefore, I\'ll guess ""GREAT"". \n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we have: we know A is at 4, E at 3, R at 2? So the word is ?REA? \n\nAnd we are guessing ""GREAT"" to test G and T? \n\nYes. \n\nSo <guess>great</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → C(absent), R(correct), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(present but wrong position)\n- **Guess 2: bread** → B(absent), R(correct), E(correct), A(correct), D(absent)\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **R** is confirmed at **position 2**.\n2. **E** is confirmed at **position 3**.\n3. **A** is confirmed at **position 4**.\n4. **C, N, B, D** are absent (not in the word).\n5.

We have the following feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(absent), R(correct), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(present but wrong position)
- So: R is in the word and in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C and N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""bread"" → B(absent), R(correct), E(correct), A(correct), D(absent)
- R is correct at position 2 (already known).
- E is correct at position 3 (new information).
- A is correct at position 4 (new information).
- B and D are absent.

Guess 3: ""great"" → G(absent), R(correct), E(correct), A(correct), T(absent)
- R, E, A are correct at positions 2, 3, 4 (as known).
- G and T are absent.

Now, we know:
- The secret word has the form: [unknown1] R E A [unknown5]
- Known correct: positions 2, 3, 4 are R, E, A.
- Absent letters: C, N, B, D, G, T.
- Present letters from guess 1: we know A and E are present (now placed) and R is present (placed). Also, from the feedback, we have no indication of other letters beyond these? But we have two positions (1 and 5) to fill, so there must be two more letters.

We also know that the secret word must contain exactly the letters: one at position 1, R, E, A, and one at position 5. Since we have no duplicates indicated (all feedback for A and E in the first guess showed one instance each, and in the second and third guesses they are placed correctly without duplication issues), we assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [X] R E A [Y], where X and Y are letters that are not in {C, N, B, D, G, T} and not R, E, A (since we assume no duplicates).

We need to find X and Y.

What letters are left? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, B, D, G, T (from the guesses). So available letters: F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need common English letters. Common letters not yet tested: S, L, P, M, F, H, K, O, U, W, etc.

We know the word ends with A? No, the word has A at position 4, so the last letter is Y.

We need to form a valid English word of the pattern ?REA?

List of possible words:
- FREAK: F at 1, K at 5
- WREAK: W at 1, K at 5
- BREAK: but B is absent, so no
- DREAD: D absent, no
- CREAK: C absent, no
- TREAK: not a word? 
- STREAK: 6 letters? No, 6 letters.
- AREAS: 5 letters? A R E A S -> but we have A at position 4, and if we put S at 5, but then we have two A's? ""AREAS"" has two A's? And positions: A at 1, R at 2, E at 3, A at 4, S at 5. But we have A at position 1? But we already have A at position 4? So duplicate A? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

But in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and got a dash, meaning A is present but not at 3. Then in the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check. If there were two A's, we wouldn't have been informed? So it's possible? 

Similarly, in the third guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check? But if there were an A at position 1, we wouldn't know? 

But we have no evidence for duplicates? However, we must consider the possibility? 

But let's first try without duplicates? 

So without duplicates, the word must be ?REA? with distinct letters? 

Common words: 
- FREAK: F, R, E, A, K
- WREAK: W, R, E, A, K
- OREAD: O, R, E, A, D -> but D is absent? 
- UREAL: U, R, E, A, L -> not common? 
- PREPA: not a word? 
- AREAS: has two A's? 

Another: ""UREAS"" is not a word? 

""CREAM"" has C? 

So the only common words without duplicates and without forbidden letters are FREAK and WREAK? 

But we have to test? 

We can guess ""FREAK"" to test F and K? 

But if we guess ""FREAK"", and the secret is ""WREAK"", we get F absent? Then we know it's ""WREAK""? 

Similarly, if we guess ""WREAK"" and the secret is ""FREAK"", we get W absent? 

But we have only two possibilities? 

But what about other words? 

What about ""SMEAR""? But that has M and S? And the pattern is S M E A R? Not ?REA? because position 2 is M? We need position 2 to be R? 

We cannot change the fixed positions? 

Another word: ""DREAM"" but D is absent? 

""BREAK"" B absent? 

""STREAK"" is 6 letters? 

""TREAT"" has T and T? But T is absent? And we have T absent? 

But T is absent, so it cannot be in the word? So ""TREAT"" is invalid? 

Similarly, ""GREAT"" we guessed and T is absent? 

So the only possibilities are ""FREAK"" and ""WREAK""? 

But what about ""CREAK""? C absent? 

Or ""SCREAM"" 6 letters? 

So yes, only two common words: ""FREAK"" and ""WREAK"". 

Therefore, we can guess either? 

But we have to choose one? 

Let's choose ""FREAK"" because F is more common than W? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? But we are constrained by the pattern? 

But we can also consider that the secret might have duplicates? For example, ""AREA"" is 4 letters? 

Or ""AREAS"": 5 letters? A R E A S? 

But we have A at position 4? And if we have A at position 1? Then the word is A R E A S? 

But we have two A's? 

Now, is ""AREAS"" a valid word? Yes, plural of area? 

But we have to check the feedback against previous guesses? 

First guess: ""crane"" → A was at position 3: we got dash, meaning A is present but not at 3? And in ""AREAS"", A is at position 1 and 4? So when we guessed A at position 3, it was not there? So dash is correct? 

Second guess: ""bread"" → we put A at position 4? And in ""AREAS"", A is at position 4? So we get check? 

Third guess: ""great"" → we put A at position 4? Check? And we put G and T? Absent? And in ""AREAS"", G and T are absent? So consistent? 

So ""AREAS"" is a possibility? 

Similarly, ""UREAS""? Not a word? 

""ORATE""? But position 2 is R? But ""ORATE"" is O R A T E? But we need E at position 3? But in ""ORATE"", position 3 is A? Not E? 

So not? 

""AREA"" is 4 letters? 

So ""AREAS"" is a candidate? 

But in ""AREAS"", we have two A's? 

Now, the pattern: position 1: A, position 2: R, position 3: E, position 4: A, position 5: S? 

But we have A at position 1? And we have not tested position 1 with A? 

In the first guess, we had no A at position 1? We had C at position 1? 

In the second guess, we had B at position 1? 

In the third, G? 

So we never tested A at position 1? 

Therefore, it is possible? 

Similarly, the last letter S? 

Now, we have two possibilities: 
- ""FREAK"" (F and K)
- ""WREAK"" (W and K)
- ""AREAS"" (A and S) -> but with duplicate A?

But in ""AREAS"", we have two A's? So we must consider that the secret might have duplicate A? 

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters? 

In ""AREAS"", the letters are A, R, E, A, S? So the set is A, R, E, S? 

We haven't used S? 

But we have not been told that S is absent? 

Similarly, for ""FREAK"": F, R, E, A, K? 

For ""WREAK"": W, R, E, A, K? 

Now, we have three possibilities? 

But we have only one guess? No, we have more guesses? We are on guess 4? 

We can guess a word that can distinguish? 

But we are constrained by the fixed positions? 

We can guess ""FREAK"": 
- If it is correct, we win? 
- If not, we get feedback: 
   - If the secret is ""WREAK"", we get F absent? Then we know it's ""WREAK""? 
   - If the secret is ""AREAS"", we get F absent? And K absent? And then we know it's ""AREAS""? 

But if we guess ""FREAK"" and the secret is ""AREAS"", we get:
- F: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓)
- E: correct (✓)
- A: correct (✓) at position 4? But in ""AREAS"", position 4 is A? So ✓? 
- K: absent (x)

Then we know the word is ?REA? with F and K absent? And we have the pattern: [X] R E A [Y] with X and Y not F, K? 

But we also know that the secret word must have an S? Because in ""AREAS"", we have S? But we don't know? 

After guessing ""FREAK"" and getting F and K absent, we know the secret is not ""FREAK"" or ""WREAK"" (because WREAK has K, which would be absent? But if we get K absent, then WREAK is also ruled out? Because it has K? 

So if we get K absent, then both FREAK and WREAK are ruled out? Then the only possibility is ""AREAS""? 

Similarly, if we get F present? But if we guess ""FREAK"" and the secret is ""WREAK"", we get F absent? And K present? Because in ""WREAK"", K is at position 5? 

But we are guessing K at position 5? So if the secret is ""WREAK"", we get:
- F: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- E: ✓
- A: ✓
- K: ✓? Because position 5 is K? 

Then we win? 

But if the secret is ""WREAK"", and we guess ""FREAK"", we get:
- F at position 1: absent? Because secret has W at position 1? 
- R: ✓
- E: ✓
- A: ✓
- K at position 5: ✓? 

So we get four checks? But we don't know the first letter? 

But we know it's not F? 

Then we can guess ""WREAK"" next? 

But we have only one more guess? 

We are on guess 4? We have two more guesses? 

But to be efficient, we can guess a word that covers multiple possibilities? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""SPEAR"" but that doesn't fit the pattern? 

We need to stick to the pattern? 

But we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests S and K? 

For example, ""AREAK"" not a word? 

""WREAK"" and ""FREAK"" both have K? 

""AREAS"" has S? 

So if we guess a word that has K at position 5 and S at position 1? But we don't know? 

But we can guess ""SKATE"" but that doesn't have R at 2? 

We must have R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? 

So the only words we can guess are those that have R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? 

So we have to choose between ""FREAK"", ""WREAK"", and ""AREAS""? 

But ""AREAS"" has A at position 1? 

So we can guess ""AREAS"" to test? 

But if we guess ""AREAS"":
- Position 1: A? 
- Position 2: R? ✓
- Position 3: E? ✓
- Position 4: A? ✓
- Position 5: S? 

If the secret is ""AREAS"", we win? 

If the secret is ""FREAK"", we get:
- A at position 1: present? But in ""FREAK"", position 1 is F? So we get A at position 1: dash? Because A is present but not at 1? 
- R: ✓
- E: ✓
- A: ✓ (at position 4)
- S: absent? 

Then we know that A is present but not at 1? And S is absent? 

Then we know the secret must be ""FREAK"" or ""WREAK""? 

Then we can guess ""FREAK"" next? 

Similarly, if the secret is ""WREAK"", we get the same: A at 1: dash, S: absent? 

Then we still have to guess between ""FREAK"" and ""WREAK""? 

So it's not efficient? 

Therefore, better to guess ""FREAK"" first? 

If we guess ""FREAK"":
- If we get all correct, we win? 
- If we get F absent and K correct, then the secret is ""WREAK""? Because if K is correct at position 5, then the word is ?REAK? and F is absent? So the first letter must be W? 
- If we get F absent and K absent, then the secret is ""AREAS""? 

This covers all cases? 

But what if there is another word? For example, ""CREAK"" but C is absent? 

Or ""BREAK"" B absent? 

Or ""TREAK"" not a word? 

Or ""OREAD""? But ""OREAD"" is O R E A D? But D is absent? 

So only three possibilities? 

Therefore, I will guess ""FREAK"". 

If we get:
- F absent, K absent: then we know it's ""AREAS"" and we can guess that next? 
- F absent, K present: then it's ""WREAK"" and we guess that next? 
- All correct: win? 

But we are on guess 4? We have two more guesses? 

So it's safe? 

Let's do it? 

<guess>freak</guess> 

But note: in ""FREAK"", we are putting A at position 4? Which we know is correct? And E at 3? Correct? R at 2? Correct? So the feedback for F and K will be informative? 

Yes. 

So I choose ""FREAK"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: 
  - R is **correct** at position 2.  
  - A and E are **present** but in the wrong positions (A not at 3, E not at 5).  
  - C and N are **absent**.  
- **Guess 2 (bread)**:  
  - R, E, A are **correct** at positions 2, 3, and 4.  
  - B and D are **absent**.  
- **Guess 3 (great)**:  
  - R, E, A are **correct** at positions 2, 3, and 4 (consistent with Guess 2).  
  - G and T are **absent**.  

### Key Insights:
1. The secret word has the fixed pattern: `[letter1] R E A [letter5]`.  
   - Positions 2, 3, and 4 are **R, E, A** (confirmed).  
2. **Absent letters**: C, N, B, D, G, T (cannot appear anywhere).  
3. **Remaining possibilities** for `letter1` and `letter5` must:  
   - Be letters not yet tested (e.g., F, H, K, L, M, P, S, W, Y, etc.).  
   - Form a valid English word.  
4. Common words fitting `?REA?` with no forbidden letters:  
   - **FREAK** (F at 1, K at 5),  
   - **WREAK** (W at 1, K at 5),  
   - **AREAS** (A at 1, S at 5; duplicate A possible).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- Test **FREAK** to maximize information:  
  - If **FREAK** is correct, we win.  
  - If feedback shows **F absent and K present**, the word is **WREAK** (since K at position 5 would be correct).  
  - If feedback shows **F absent and K absent**, the word is **AREAS** (only other common option).  
- This guess efficiently narrows down to 1 solution with minimal risk.  

<guess>freak</guess>",freak,"We have the following feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → C(absent), R(correct), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(present but wrong position)
- So: R is in the word and in position 2.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C and N are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""bread"" → B(absent), R(correct), E(correct), A(correct), D(absent)
- R is correct at position 2 (already known).
- E is correct at position 3 (new information).
- A is correct at position 4 (new information).
- B and D are absent.

Guess 3: ""great"" → G(absent), R(correct), E(correct), A(correct), T(absent)
- R, E, A are correct at positions 2, 3, 4 (as known).
- G and T are absent.

Now, we know:
- The secret word has the form: [unknown1] R E A [unknown5]
- Known correct: positions 2, 3, 4 are R, E, A.
- Absent letters: C, N, B, D, G, T.
- Present letters from guess 1: we know A and E are present (now placed) and R is present (placed). Also, from the feedback, we have no indication of other letters beyond these? But we have two positions (1 and 5) to fill, so there must be two more letters.

We also know that the secret word must contain exactly the letters: one at position 1, R, E, A, and one at position 5. Since we have no duplicates indicated (all feedback for A and E in the first guess showed one instance each, and in the second and third guesses they are placed correctly without duplication issues), we assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: [X] R E A [Y], where X and Y are letters that are not in {C, N, B, D, G, T} and not R, E, A (since we assume no duplicates).

We need to find X and Y.

What letters are left? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, B, D, G, T (from the guesses). So available letters: F, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need common English letters. Common letters not yet tested: S, L, P, M, F, H, K, O, U, W, etc.

We know the word ends with A? No, the word has A at position 4, so the last letter is Y.

We need to form a valid English word of the pattern ?REA?

List of possible words:
- FREAK: F at 1, K at 5
- WREAK: W at 1, K at 5
- BREAK: but B is absent, so no
- DREAD: D absent, no
- CREAK: C absent, no
- TREAK: not a word? 
- STREAK: 6 letters? No, 6 letters.
- AREAS: 5 letters? A R E A S -> but we have A at position 4, and if we put S at 5, but then we have two A's? ""AREAS"" has two A's? And positions: A at 1, R at 2, E at 3, A at 4, S at 5. But we have A at position 1? But we already have A at position 4? So duplicate A? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? 

But in the first guess, we had A at position 3 and got a dash, meaning A is present but not at 3. Then in the second guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check. If there were two A's, we wouldn't have been informed? So it's possible? 

Similarly, in the third guess, we put A at position 4 and got a check? But if there were an A at position 1, we wouldn't know? 

But we have no evidence for duplicates? However, we must consider the possibility? 

But let's first try without duplicates? 

So without duplicates, the word must be ?REA? with distinct letters? 

Common words: 
- FREAK: F, R, E, A, K
- WREAK: W, R, E, A, K
- OREAD: O, R, E, A, D -> but D is absent? 
- UREAL: U, R, E, A, L -> not common? 
- PREPA: not a word? 
- AREAS: has two A's? 

Another: ""UREAS"" is not a word? 

""CREAM"" has C? 

So the only common words without duplicates and without forbidden letters are FREAK and WREAK? 

But we have to test? 

We can guess ""FREAK"" to test F and K? 

But if we guess ""FREAK"", and the secret is ""WREAK"", we get F absent? Then we know it's ""WREAK""? 

Similarly, if we guess ""WREAK"" and the secret is ""FREAK"", we get W absent? 

But we have only two possibilities? 

But what about other words? 

What about ""SMEAR""? But that has M and S? And the pattern is S M E A R? Not ?REA? because position 2 is M? We need position 2 to be R? 

We cannot change the fixed positions? 

Another word: ""DREAM"" but D is absent? 

""BREAK"" B absent? 

""STREAK"" is 6 letters? 

""TREAT"" has T and T? But T is absent? And we have T absent? 

But T is absent, so it cannot be in the word? So ""TREAT"" is invalid? 

Similarly, ""GREAT"" we guessed and T is absent? 

So the only possibilities are ""FREAK"" and ""WREAK""? 

But what about ""CREAK""? C absent? 

Or ""SCREAM"" 6 letters? 

So yes, only two common words: ""FREAK"" and ""WREAK"". 

Therefore, we can guess either? 

But we have to choose one? 

Let's choose ""FREAK"" because F is more common than W? 

But we don't know? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more common letters? But we are constrained by the pattern? 

But we can also consider that the secret might have duplicates? For example, ""AREA"" is 4 letters? 

Or ""AREAS"": 5 letters? A R E A S? 

But we have A at position 4? And if we have A at position 1? Then the word is A R E A S? 

But we have two A's? 

Now, is ""AREAS"" a valid word? Yes, plural of area? 

But we have to check the feedback against previous guesses? 

First guess: ""crane"" → A was at position 3: we got dash, meaning A is present but not at 3? And in ""AREAS"", A is at position 1 and 4? So when we guessed A at position 3, it was not there? So dash is correct? 

Second guess: ""bread"" → we put A at position 4? And in ""AREAS"", A is at position 4? So we get check? 

Third guess: ""great"" → we put A at position 4? Check? And we put G and T? Absent? And in ""AREAS"", G and T are absent? So consistent? 

So ""AREAS"" is a possibility? 

Similarly, ""UREAS""? Not a word? 

""ORATE""? But position 2 is R? But ""ORATE"" is O R A T E? But we need E at position 3? But in ""ORATE"", position 3 is A? Not E? 

So not? 

""AREA"" is 4 letters? 

So ""AREAS"" is a candidate? 

But in ""AREAS"", we have two A's? 

Now, the pattern: position 1: A, position 2: R, position 3: E, position 4: A, position 5: S? 

But we have A at position 1? And we have not tested position 1 with A? 

In the first guess, we had no A at position 1? We had C at position 1? 

In the second guess, we had B at position 1? 

In the third, G? 

So we never tested A at position 1? 

Therefore, it is possible? 

Similarly, the last letter S? 

Now, we have two possibilities: 
- ""FREAK"" (F and K)
- ""WREAK"" (W and K)
- ""AREAS"" (A and S) -> but with duplicate A?

But in ""AREAS"", we have two A's? So we must consider that the secret might have duplicate A? 

But we have to avoid the forbidden letters? 

In ""AREAS"", the letters are A, R, E, A, S? So the set is A, R, E, S? 

We haven't used S? 

But we have not been told that S is absent? 

Similarly, for ""FREAK"": F, R, E, A, K? 

For ""WREAK"": W, R, E, A, K? 

Now, we have three possibilities? 

But we have only one guess? No, we have more guesses? We are on guess 4? 

We can guess a word that can distinguish? 

But we are constrained by the fixed positions? 

We can guess ""FREAK"": 
- If it is correct, we win? 
- If not, we get feedback: 
   - If the secret is ""WREAK"", we get F absent? Then we know it's ""WREAK""? 
   - If the secret is ""AREAS"", we get F absent? And K absent? And then we know it's ""AREAS""? 

But if we guess ""FREAK"" and the secret is ""AREAS"", we get:
- F: absent (x)
- R: correct (✓)
- E: correct (✓)
- A: correct (✓) at position 4? But in ""AREAS"", position 4 is A? So ✓? 
- K: absent (x)

Then we know the word is ?REA? with F and K absent? And we have the pattern: [X] R E A [Y] with X and Y not F, K? 

But we also know that the secret word must have an S? Because in ""AREAS"", we have S? But we don't know? 

After guessing ""FREAK"" and getting F and K absent, we know the secret is not ""FREAK"" or ""WREAK"" (because WREAK has K, which would be absent? But if we get K absent, then WREAK is also ruled out? Because it has K? 

So if we get K absent, then both FREAK and WREAK are ruled out? Then the only possibility is ""AREAS""? 

Similarly, if we get F present? But if we guess ""FREAK"" and the secret is ""WREAK"", we get F absent? And K present? Because in ""WREAK"", K is at position 5? 

But we are guessing K at position 5? So if the secret is ""WREAK"", we get:
- F: absent (x)
- R: ✓
- E: ✓
- A: ✓
- K: ✓? Because position 5 is K? 

Then we win? 

But if the secret is ""WREAK"", and we guess ""FREAK"", we get:
- F at position 1: absent? Because secret has W at position 1? 
- R: ✓
- E: ✓
- A: ✓
- K at position 5: ✓? 

So we get four checks? But we don't know the first letter? 

But we know it's not F? 

Then we can guess ""WREAK"" next? 

But we have only one more guess? 

We are on guess 4? We have two more guesses? 

But to be efficient, we can guess a word that covers multiple possibilities? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""SPEAR"" but that doesn't fit the pattern? 

We need to stick to the pattern? 

But we can guess a word that has the fixed positions and tests S and K? 

For example, ""AREAK"" not a word? 

""WREAK"" and ""FREAK"" both have K? 

""AREAS"" has S? 

So if we guess a word that has K at position 5 and S at position 1? But we don't know? 

But we can guess ""SKATE"" but that doesn't have R at 2? 

We must have R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? 

So the only words we can guess are those that have R at 2, E at 3, A at 4? 

So we have to choose between ""FREAK"", ""WREAK"", and ""AREAS""? 

But ""AREAS"" has A at position 1? 

So we can guess ""AREAS"" to test? 

But if we guess ""AREAS"":
- Position 1: A? 
- Position 2: R? ✓
- Position 3: E? ✓
- Position 4: A? ✓
- Position 5: S? 

If the secret is ""AREAS"", we win? 

If the secret is ""FREAK"", we get:
- A at position 1: present? But in ""FREAK"", position 1 is F? So we get A at position 1: dash? Because A is present but not at 1? 
- R: ✓
- E: ✓
- A: ✓ (at position 4)
- S: absent? 

Then we know that A is present but not at 1? And S is absent? 

Then we know the secret must be ""FREAK"" or ""WREAK""? 

Then we can guess ""FREAK"" next? 

Similarly, if the secret is ""WREAK"", we get the same: A at 1: dash, S: absent? 

Then we still have to guess between ""FREAK"" and ""WREAK""? 

So it's not efficient? 

Therefore, better to guess ""FREAK"" first? 

If we guess ""FREAK"":
- If we get all correct, we win? 
- If we get F absent and K correct, then the secret is ""WREAK""? Because if K is correct at position 5, then the word is ?REAK? and F is absent? So the first letter must be W? 
- If we get F absent and K absent, then the secret is ""AREAS""? 

This covers all cases? 

But what if there is another word? For example, ""CREAK"" but C is absent? 

Or ""BREAK"" B absent? 

Or ""TREAK"" not a word? 

Or ""OREAD""? But ""OREAD"" is O R E A D? But D is absent? 

So only three possibilities? 

Therefore, I will guess ""FREAK"". 

If we get:
- F absent, K absent: then we know it's ""AREAS"" and we can guess that next? 
- F absent, K present: then it's ""WREAK"" and we guess that next? 
- All correct: win? 

But we are on guess 4? We have two more guesses? 

So it's safe? 

Let's do it?

But note: in ""FREAK"", we are putting A at position 4? Which we know is correct? And E at 3? Correct? R at 2? Correct? So the feedback for F and K will be informative? 

Yes. 

So I choose ""FREAK"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
