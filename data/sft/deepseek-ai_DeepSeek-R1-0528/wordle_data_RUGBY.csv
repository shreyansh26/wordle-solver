We are making the first guess. We have no prior information. A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 The word ""SLATE"" is often a good starter because it has two common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T). Alternatively, ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"" (though ROATE is less common but used in Wordle).

 However, to be safe, let's choose a word that is definitely a valid English word and covers multiple common letters.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E

 This has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). It also avoids repeated letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

As a first guess, I need a word that maximizes information by covering common letters and positions. A good starting word should include frequent vowels and consonants to reveal potential matches. Common choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ROAST"" because they contain multiple vowels and popular consonants.

After considering, ""CRANE"" is an excellent option:
- It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, providing broad coverage.
- C and R are frequent starters, while E is common in the end position.

This choice will generate rich feedback to inform subsequent guesses, regardless of the secret word.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

This means:
- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (because in ""crane"", R is in the second position, and it's marked as wrong position).
- A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains the letter R, but not as the second letter.
- Does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Since R is present but not in the second position, it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We have five positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Must be a valid five-letter word.
- Must avoid the letters C, A, N, E since they are not in the word.
- Must include the letter R somewhere, but not in the second position.

Additionally, we should aim to cover other common letters to gain more information.

Let's think about letters that are common in English and not yet tested. 
Common consonants: S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.
Vowels: We know E and A are out, so remaining vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

Considering R must be included, and avoiding position 2 for R.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5.

We should also use new letters to maximize information.

Possible new letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

A word that includes R and avoids C,A,N,E and places R not in the second position.

Examples: 
- R at start: words like ""ROAST"" but A is out -> not possible.
Since A is out, we need words without A.

Try ""RIGHT"": 
R (position 1), I, G, H, T. 
But we need to check if all are allowed? C,A,N,E out, so G,H,I,T are new.
This word is valid and has R in position 1 (which is allowed).

But wait, we have feedback that R is not in position 2, but position 1 is okay.

Another possibility: ""PROUD"" but P,R,O,U,D? But P is new? Yes, but note that positions: R would be in position 2? But the feedback says R is not in position 2? No: we must avoid R in position 2 because in the feedback R was in position 2 and marked wrong position, meaning in the secret word R is not in position 2. So in our next guess, we can put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are multiple R's. In the feedback, we had only one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. So at least one R exists, but we don't know about duplicates.

Since we are only at the second guess, we can assume one R for simplicity until contradicted.

Let me brainstorm some words without the forbidden letters (C,A,N,E) and with R not in position 2, and including other common letters.

Consider ""SPRIG"": but it has P,R,I,G,S? Positions: R is in position 3? 
But we must check forbidden letters: C,A,N,E none are in SPRIG? And we have R in position 3.

SPRIG: S, P, R (position 3), I, G.

But let me see: common words. Another: ""THROW"" has T,H,R,O,W? R in position 3? and avoids A,E,C,N? Yes.

""THROW"": T (1), H (2), R (3), O (4), W (5). And letters: T, H, R, O, W.

But note: the second position in our guess is H. We have no information about position 2 yet.

We could use a word that uses more vowels? Since A and E are out, we have I, O, U. Let me include one of them.

Another word: ""ROTIS"" (might not be common)? Let's think of common words.

A good word: ""FLIRT""? F,L,I,R,T. R is in position 4.

""FLIRT"": letters F,L,I,R,T. No forbidden letters. R is at position 4.

But maybe we can do better? We want to test several common letters.

Another: ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T. R at position 4? and no forbidden letters? This has O and S, P, T which are common.

Of course, ""SPORT"" has R in position 4? Let me spell: S-P-O-R-T, so position 4 is R? Then yes.

But note: the feedback does not forbid position 4, so that's okay.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that places R in position 1 to rule it out quickly.

For example: ""ROBOT""? But has B,O,T and R? But R is in position 1? Then O in position 2? But A and E are out, so O and I/U are the remaining vowels. However, the feedback doesn't forbid O in position 2.

But ""ROBOT"" has a repeated O? But that's acceptable? Also, we don't know if O is in the word or not.

To maximize new letters, we should avoid repeats.

Also, note that we are missing information about positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (since we only know R is not in position 2).

So, let me choose a word that:
- Starts with R (position 1) to test that position, and because R must be somewhere.
- Uses new common letters: T, O, L, S, etc.

Word: ""ROTLS""? Not a word. ""ROWTS""? Not common.

Common word: ""RISKY"" has I, S, K, Y? And R at the start.

But R is position 1.

""RISKY"": R (1), I (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). This avoids A,E,C,N? Yes? Then good.

But what about position 2? We don't know about I. Also, we need to test a vowel? I is a vowel.

Another common word: ""DRIPS""? But D, R, I, P, S? But D is new? And R at position 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know R is not in position 2? Is that true?

Clarify: we have a rule: R is present but not in position 2. Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be marked wrong position (because it's not correct). But we can do that? The feedback will tell us again that R is in wrong position? It might be redundant.

However, for our information, if we put R in position 2 again, and it gets marked as '-', that doesn't give us new information. We already know position 2 is wrong. So we should avoid position 2 for R to test other positions.

Therefore, in the next guess, R should be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We can set it in position 1 to check if it's correct there.

If we guess R in position 1 and it becomes correct (✓), then we know R is first letter. If it's marked '-', then we know R is not in position 1 either.

So to test position 1: put R at start.

Word: ""RUSTS""? But repeated? Avoid repeats if possible.

""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y. Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. R at position 1.

But U? We don't know.

""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids forbidden? Yes. But D and Y?

""ROGUE""? But E is forbidden -> doesn't work.

""ROBOT"": has O repeated? And B,O,T? 

But we might use a word without repeating letters.

""RAPID""? But A is out -> invalid.

""RINSE"" has N -> invalid because N is not in the word.

We don't have many options? 

Another: ""RIFTS"" - R,I,F,T,S. All distinct and new? F is a bit less common? 

But acceptable.

""RISKY"" as above: R, I, S, K, Y.

Let me choose ""RISKY"" because it uses common letters? Or ""ROBIN""? But N is forbidden -> not valid.

Wait, ""ROBIN"" has N -> we must avoid.

Another word: ""ROYAL""? But A -> invalid.

""PRIZE""? But Z and E -> E is out -> invalid.

""FLIRT"" as before: F,L,I,R,T - R in position 4? But we don't test position 1 then.

To maximize coverage of positions, we can try to set R in a new position and common letters.

Consider ""THIRD"": T,H,I,R,D? R in position 4? T,H,I,R,D.

That uses T and H, and I and D.

Also ""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R,T -> R in position 4? and S,H,I,T.

Now, that includes common consonants and a vowel I.

Similarly, ""SHIRT"" has letters S, H, I, R, T.

We want to test S, H, T which are common.

So, ""SHIRT"" might be a good candidate: 
- Includes R not in position 2 (here it's in position 4).
- Avoids forbidden letters: C,A,N,E.
- Uses new letters: S, H, I, T (and R again, but R we know is in).

But note: we need to see if these letters are likely.

We could use ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T -> O is a vowel we haven't tried? We haven't tried O or I. 

But ""SHIRT"" has the vowel I.

Another: ""STORM""? But M? And O? Let me see.

Wait, we don't have O tested? We should test O because it's a common vowel.

So consider ""SPORT"": 
- S (new), P (new), O (vowel), R (known), T (new). 
But R in position 4? So we are testing O and S, P, T.

Alternatively, ""GROUP"" but G,R,O,U,P? But U is a vowel? R in position 2? Wait, position 2: we cannot put R in position 2? Because R was marked wrong there. So GROUP has R in position 2 -> we shouldn't do that? Because we know it will be incorrect.

GROUP: G, R (2), O, U, P -> R at 2 is not allowed? The feedback would mark R as wrong position again? It doesn't break the rule, but it won't give us new information about R. So better to avoid.

Then avoid position 2 for R.

So, let me choose between:
- ""RISKY"": R at 1, I at 2, S,K,Y
- ""THIRD"": T,H,I (at 3), R at 4, D
- ""FLIRT"": F,L,I,R at 4, T
- ""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R at 4, T
- ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R at 4, T

But I like ""SHIRT"" because it covers S,H,I,T and R.

""SPORT"" adds O which is another common vowel? But O is not tested? Since we tested A,E (both out), testing O would be good.

So ""SPORT"" is maybe better? 

Let me see commonality: both valid.

But note: the secret word might have O? Without testing, we don't know.

In ""SHIRT"", we test I (vowel) and common consonants S,H,T.

We know R is in the word, so we are also testing position for R? In ""SPORT"" R is at position 4? Same in ""SHIRT""? Both are at position 4? Then we get information: if R is at position 4 and marked ✓, then it's correct. If marked '-', then R is not at position 4? But we know R is in the word, so it can be elsewhere.

Alternatively, we can put R at position 3? 

For example, ""TRIOS"": T,R at 2? No: T at 1, R at 2 -> cannot because R in position 2 is forbidden.

How about ""STRIP"": S,T,R? Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)? That way R is at position 3? And avoids position 2.

""STRIP"": S,T,R,I,P.

This uses S,T,R,I,P -> avoids forbidden? And R in position 3? 

Similarly, ""STRAP"" has A -> invalid.

So ""STRIP"" is okay? And it tests position 3 for R? And letters S,T,I,P.

I think ""STRIP"" is a good candidate: 
- Tests R at position 3 (new position).
- Tests new common letters: S, T, I, P.

Now, the feedback: 
In our first guess ""crane"", we ruled out A, E, N, C? And R is in word but not position 2. 

So we have 6 letters ruled out? But also, we know the word doesn't have A, E, N, C? So we have more freedom? Or less? 

Let me choose ""STRIP"".

Also, we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Another word: ""PRISM"" - P,R,I,S,M? But M? And positions: P(1), R(2) -> position 2? Avoid because R cannot be position 2? So ""PRISM"" has R at position 2: discard.

So my candidates: ""STRIP"", ""SHIRT"", ""SPORT"", ""RISKY"".

I think ""STRIP"" tests more letters? S, T, R, I, P? That's common.

Or ""SPORT"" tests O? 

But we haven't tested O? So testing O might be good? Because if O is in the word, we'll know.

But with ""STRIP"", we test I? That also a vowel? And I is more common than O? 

Actually, in English, E is most common, then A, then O, then I? So O is more common than I? 

According to some sources, letter frequency: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, etc. But we know R is in, and E,A,N are out? So O and I are the next common vowels? Actually O is more common than I? So to test O might be better? 

Let me see: O has about 7.5%, I has 6.9%? Slightly more O. 

But in any case, both important.

But with ""STRIP"", we get a chance to have R in a new position (3), and we test I (vowel) and S,T (common consonants).

With ""SPORT"", we test O (vowel) and S,P,T? And R at position 4? We don't get a new position for R? If we test position 3 or position 1 for R, that might be better? 

For example, if I set R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get '-', meaning R is not at 1, so we know it must be at 3,4, or 5? And the next guess we can avoid 1 and 2? 

Similarly, for position 3: if we test it and it's correct, we know; if not, we eliminate that position? 

Now, testing position 3 might be as good as position 1? 

But position 1 is the start, which is important? But also, R is common at the beginning? 

Considering that, let me try ""RISKY"" which tests R at position 1? 

Also, ""RISKY"" uses S,K,Y? Y is less common? So maybe not? 

Another word: ""RHYME""? But H,Y,M,E? E is forbidden -> invalid.

""ROUGH""? But G and H? And U? R at 1? 

But U is a vowel? We haven't tested U? 

We also have U? And Y? 

But for second guess, let's avoid rare letters? S, T, O, I, L, etc. are better? 

I think ""STRIP"" is good? Or ""SHORT""? 

""SHORT"": S,H,O,R,T? That's S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5? And it includes O? So we test O? And R at position 4? 

That avoids forbidden? C,A,N,E not in this word? 

Then ""SHORT"" tests S, H, O, R, T? R at position 4? 

But we are repeating R at position 4? In feedback? It may be marked - if position 4 is wrong? But we don't know? 

But position 4 might be correct? So it's worth testing? 

Since we haven't tested position 4? 

But in ""STRIP"", we test R at position 3? 

I think either is acceptable? 

But to decide: let me choose ""SHORT"" because it tests O? 

To avoid missing a common vowel? 

So ""SHORT""?

Similarly, ""SPORT"" is also good? Without H? 

Both? 

I think I'll go with ""STRIP"": it tests position 3 for R and covers S,T,R,I,P? I is a vowel? 

But O is more common? 

However, we already have R, so we don't need to test R itself? But we need to find its position? 

Perhaps in terms of probability? 

But given constraint, let me settle on ""SPORT"": 
why? It avoids the previously forbidden letters, includes R not in position 2 (here at 4), and tests two common consonants S,P,T and a vowel O? 

S and T are very common? So ""SPORT"" is good? 

Thus, my second guess: ""SPORT"".

<thinking>
From the first guess ""crane"", feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x). This eliminates C, A, N, E and indicates R is present but not in the second position.

For the next guess:
- Must include R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Must avoid C, A, N, E.
- Should explore new common letters (e.g., T, O, L, S, P, I) and positions.

Candidate words considered: 
- ""SHIRT"" (R at position 4; tests S, H, I, T).
- ""STRIP"" (R at position 3; tests S, T, R, I, P).
- ""SPORT"" (R at position 4; tests S, P, O, T).

Chose ""SPORT"" because:
- It includes O, a common vowel not yet tested.
- Uses common consonants S, P, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters and places R appropriately.

Based on the previous feedback:
- Secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E
- Contains R, but not in position 2
- R must appear in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5

For next guess:
- Must include R, avoiding position 2
- Must omit C, A, N, E
- Should test new common letters: S, T, O, P, etc. to gain information
- Prioritize vowels (O) since A/E are eliminated

Chose ""SPORT"":
- Positions: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) → R safely in position 4
- Uses common letters S, P, O, T, testing O (vowel) and key consonants
- Valid English word, no conflicts

- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (because in ""crane"", R is in the second position, and it's marked as wrong position).
- A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains the letter R, but not as the second letter.
- Does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Since R is present but not in the second position, it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We have five positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Must be a valid five-letter word.
- Must avoid the letters C, A, N, E since they are not in the word.
- Must include the letter R somewhere, but not in the second position.

Additionally, we should aim to cover other common letters to gain more information.

Let's think about letters that are common in English and not yet tested. 
Common consonants: S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.
Vowels: We know E and A are out, so remaining vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

Considering R must be included, and avoiding position 2 for R.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5.

We should also use new letters to maximize information.

Possible new letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

A word that includes R and avoids C,A,N,E and places R not in the second position.

Examples: 
- R at start: words like ""ROAST"" but A is out -> not possible.
Since A is out, we need words without A.

Try ""RIGHT"": 
R (position 1), I, G, H, T. 
But we need to check if all are allowed? C,A,N,E out, so G,H,I,T are new.
This word is valid and has R in position 1 (which is allowed).

But wait, we have feedback that R is not in position 2, but position 1 is okay.

Another possibility: ""PROUD"" but P,R,O,U,D? But P is new? Yes, but note that positions: R would be in position 2? But the feedback says R is not in position 2? No: we must avoid R in position 2 because in the feedback R was in position 2 and marked wrong position, meaning in the secret word R is not in position 2. So in our next guess, we can put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are multiple R's. In the feedback, we had only one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. So at least one R exists, but we don't know about duplicates.

Since we are only at the second guess, we can assume one R for simplicity until contradicted.

Let me brainstorm some words without the forbidden letters (C,A,N,E) and with R not in position 2, and including other common letters.

Consider ""SPRIG"": but it has P,R,I,G,S? Positions: R is in position 3? 
But we must check forbidden letters: C,A,N,E none are in SPRIG? And we have R in position 3.

SPRIG: S, P, R (position 3), I, G.

But let me see: common words. Another: ""THROW"" has T,H,R,O,W? R in position 3? and avoids A,E,C,N? Yes.

""THROW"": T (1), H (2), R (3), O (4), W (5). And letters: T, H, R, O, W.

But note: the second position in our guess is H. We have no information about position 2 yet.

We could use a word that uses more vowels? Since A and E are out, we have I, O, U. Let me include one of them.

Another word: ""ROTIS"" (might not be common)? Let's think of common words.

A good word: ""FLIRT""? F,L,I,R,T. R is in position 4.

""FLIRT"": letters F,L,I,R,T. No forbidden letters. R is at position 4.

But maybe we can do better? We want to test several common letters.

Another: ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T. R at position 4? and no forbidden letters? This has O and S, P, T which are common.

Of course, ""SPORT"" has R in position 4? Let me spell: S-P-O-R-T, so position 4 is R? Then yes.

But note: the feedback does not forbid position 4, so that's okay.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that places R in position 1 to rule it out quickly.

For example: ""ROBOT""? But has B,O,T and R? But R is in position 1? Then O in position 2? But A and E are out, so O and I/U are the remaining vowels. However, the feedback doesn't forbid O in position 2.

But ""ROBOT"" has a repeated O? But that's acceptable? Also, we don't know if O is in the word or not.

To maximize new letters, we should avoid repeats.

Also, note that we are missing information about positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (since we only know R is not in position 2).

So, let me choose a word that:
- Starts with R (position 1) to test that position, and because R must be somewhere.
- Uses new common letters: T, O, L, S, etc.

Word: ""ROTLS""? Not a word. ""ROWTS""? Not common.

Common word: ""RISKY"" has I, S, K, Y? And R at the start.

But R is position 1.

""RISKY"": R (1), I (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). This avoids A,E,C,N? Yes? Then good.

But what about position 2? We don't know about I. Also, we need to test a vowel? I is a vowel.

Another common word: ""DRIPS""? But D, R, I, P, S? But D is new? And R at position 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know R is not in position 2? Is that true?

Clarify: we have a rule: R is present but not in position 2. Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be marked wrong position (because it's not correct). But we can do that? The feedback will tell us again that R is in wrong position? It might be redundant.

However, for our information, if we put R in position 2 again, and it gets marked as '-', that doesn't give us new information. We already know position 2 is wrong. So we should avoid position 2 for R to test other positions.

Therefore, in the next guess, R should be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We can set it in position 1 to check if it's correct there.

If we guess R in position 1 and it becomes correct (✓), then we know R is first letter. If it's marked '-', then we know R is not in position 1 either.

So to test position 1: put R at start.

Word: ""RUSTS""? But repeated? Avoid repeats if possible.

""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y. Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. R at position 1.

But U? We don't know.

""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids forbidden? Yes. But D and Y?

""ROGUE""? But E is forbidden -> doesn't work.

""ROBOT"": has O repeated? And B,O,T? 

But we might use a word without repeating letters.

""RAPID""? But A is out -> invalid.

""RINSE"" has N -> invalid because N is not in the word.

We don't have many options? 

Another: ""RIFTS"" - R,I,F,T,S. All distinct and new? F is a bit less common? 

But acceptable.

""RISKY"" as above: R, I, S, K, Y.

Let me choose ""RISKY"" because it uses common letters? Or ""ROBIN""? But N is forbidden -> not valid.

Wait, ""ROBIN"" has N -> we must avoid.

Another word: ""ROYAL""? But A -> invalid.

""PRIZE""? But Z and E -> E is out -> invalid.

""FLIRT"" as before: F,L,I,R,T - R in position 4? But we don't test position 1 then.

To maximize coverage of positions, we can try to set R in a new position and common letters.

Consider ""THIRD"": T,H,I,R,D? R in position 4? T,H,I,R,D.

That uses T and H, and I and D.

Also ""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R,T -> R in position 4? and S,H,I,T.

Now, that includes common consonants and a vowel I.

Similarly, ""SHIRT"" has letters S, H, I, R, T.

We want to test S, H, T which are common.

So, ""SHIRT"" might be a good candidate: 
- Includes R not in position 2 (here it's in position 4).
- Avoids forbidden letters: C,A,N,E.
- Uses new letters: S, H, I, T (and R again, but R we know is in).

But note: we need to see if these letters are likely.

We could use ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T -> O is a vowel we haven't tried? We haven't tried O or I. 

But ""SHIRT"" has the vowel I.

Another: ""STORM""? But M? And O? Let me see.

Wait, we don't have O tested? We should test O because it's a common vowel.

So consider ""SPORT"": 
- S (new), P (new), O (vowel), R (known), T (new). 
But R in position 4? So we are testing O and S, P, T.

Alternatively, ""GROUP"" but G,R,O,U,P? But U is a vowel? R in position 2? Wait, position 2: we cannot put R in position 2? Because R was marked wrong there. So GROUP has R in position 2 -> we shouldn't do that? Because we know it will be incorrect.

GROUP: G, R (2), O, U, P -> R at 2 is not allowed? The feedback would mark R as wrong position again? It doesn't break the rule, but it won't give us new information about R. So better to avoid.

Then avoid position 2 for R.

So, let me choose between:
- ""RISKY"": R at 1, I at 2, S,K,Y
- ""THIRD"": T,H,I (at 3), R at 4, D
- ""FLIRT"": F,L,I,R at 4, T
- ""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R at 4, T
- ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R at 4, T

But I like ""SHIRT"" because it covers S,H,I,T and R.

""SPORT"" adds O which is another common vowel? But O is not tested? Since we tested A,E (both out), testing O would be good.

So ""SPORT"" is maybe better? 

Let me see commonality: both valid.

But note: the secret word might have O? Without testing, we don't know.

In ""SHIRT"", we test I (vowel) and common consonants S,H,T.

We know R is in the word, so we are also testing position for R? In ""SPORT"" R is at position 4? Same in ""SHIRT""? Both are at position 4? Then we get information: if R is at position 4 and marked ✓, then it's correct. If marked '-', then R is not at position 4? But we know R is in the word, so it can be elsewhere.

Alternatively, we can put R at position 3? 

For example, ""TRIOS"": T,R at 2? No: T at 1, R at 2 -> cannot because R in position 2 is forbidden.

How about ""STRIP"": S,T,R? Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)? That way R is at position 3? And avoids position 2.

""STRIP"": S,T,R,I,P.

This uses S,T,R,I,P -> avoids forbidden? And R in position 3? 

Similarly, ""STRAP"" has A -> invalid.

So ""STRIP"" is okay? And it tests position 3 for R? And letters S,T,I,P.

I think ""STRIP"" is a good candidate: 
- Tests R at position 3 (new position).
- Tests new common letters: S, T, I, P.

Now, the feedback: 
In our first guess ""crane"", we ruled out A, E, N, C? And R is in word but not position 2. 

So we have 6 letters ruled out? But also, we know the word doesn't have A, E, N, C? So we have more freedom? Or less? 

Let me choose ""STRIP"".

Also, we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Another word: ""PRISM"" - P,R,I,S,M? But M? And positions: P(1), R(2) -> position 2? Avoid because R cannot be position 2? So ""PRISM"" has R at position 2: discard.

So my candidates: ""STRIP"", ""SHIRT"", ""SPORT"", ""RISKY"".

I think ""STRIP"" tests more letters? S, T, R, I, P? That's common.

Or ""SPORT"" tests O? 

But we haven't tested O? So testing O might be good? Because if O is in the word, we'll know.

But with ""STRIP"", we test I? That also a vowel? And I is more common than O? 

Actually, in English, E is most common, then A, then O, then I? So O is more common than I? 

According to some sources, letter frequency: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, etc. But we know R is in, and E,A,N are out? So O and I are the next common vowels? Actually O is more common than I? So to test O might be better? 

Let me see: O has about 7.5%, I has 6.9%? Slightly more O. 

But in any case, both important.

But with ""STRIP"", we get a chance to have R in a new position (3), and we test I (vowel) and S,T (common consonants).

With ""SPORT"", we test O (vowel) and S,P,T? And R at position 4? We don't get a new position for R? If we test position 3 or position 1 for R, that might be better? 

For example, if I set R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get '-', meaning R is not at 1, so we know it must be at 3,4, or 5? And the next guess we can avoid 1 and 2? 

Similarly, for position 3: if we test it and it's correct, we know; if not, we eliminate that position? 

Now, testing position 3 might be as good as position 1? 

But position 1 is the start, which is important? But also, R is common at the beginning? 

Considering that, let me try ""RISKY"" which tests R at position 1? 

Also, ""RISKY"" uses S,K,Y? Y is less common? So maybe not? 

Another word: ""RHYME""? But H,Y,M,E? E is forbidden -> invalid.

""ROUGH""? But G and H? And U? R at 1? 

But U is a vowel? We haven't tested U? 

We also have U? And Y? 

But for second guess, let's avoid rare letters? S, T, O, I, L, etc. are better? 

I think ""STRIP"" is good? Or ""SHORT""? 

""SHORT"": S,H,O,R,T? That's S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5? And it includes O? So we test O? And R at position 4? 

That avoids forbidden? C,A,N,E not in this word? 

Then ""SHORT"" tests S, H, O, R, T? R at position 4? 

But we are repeating R at position 4? In feedback? It may be marked - if position 4 is wrong? But we don't know? 

But position 4 might be correct? So it's worth testing? 

Since we haven't tested position 4? 

But in ""STRIP"", we test R at position 3? 

I think either is acceptable? 

But to decide: let me choose ""SHORT"" because it tests O? 

To avoid missing a common vowel? 

So ""SHORT""?

Similarly, ""SPORT"" is also good? Without H? 

Both? 

I think I'll go with ""STRIP"": it tests position 3 for R and covers S,T,R,I,P? I is a vowel? 

But O is more common? 

However, we already have R, so we don't need to test R itself? But we need to find its position? 

Perhaps in terms of probability? 

But given constraint, let me settle on ""SPORT"": 
why? It avoids the previously forbidden letters, includes R not in position 2 (here at 4), and tests two common consonants S,P,T and a vowel O? 

S and T are very common? So ""SPORT"" is good? 

Thus, my second guess: ""SPORT"".

<thinking>
From the first guess ""crane"", feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x). This eliminates C, A, N, E and indicates R is present but not in the second position.

For the next guess:
- Must include R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Must avoid C, A, N, E.
- Should explore new common letters (e.g., T, O, L, S, P, I) and positions.

Candidate words considered: 
- ""SHIRT"" (R at position 4; tests S, H, I, T).
- ""STRIP"" (R at position 3; tests S, T, R, I, P).
- ""SPORT"" (R at position 4; tests S, P, O, T).

Chose ""SPORT"" because:
- It includes O, a common vowel not yet tested.
- Uses common consonants S, P, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters and places R appropriately.
</thinking>

<guess>sport</guess><thinking>
Based on the previous feedback:
- Secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E
- Contains R, but not in position 2
- R must appear in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5

For next guess:
- Must include R, avoiding position 2
- Must omit C, A, N, E
- Should test new common letters: S, T, O, P, etc. to gain information
- Prioritize vowels (O) since A/E are eliminated

Chose ""SPORT"":
- Positions: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) → R safely in position 4
- Uses common letters S, P, O, T, testing O (vowel) and key consonants
- Valid English word, no conflicts

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. We have no prior information. A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 The word ""SLATE"" is often a good starter because it has two common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T). Alternatively, ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"" (though ROATE is less common but used in Wordle).

 However, to be safe, let's choose a word that is definitely a valid English word and covers multiple common letters.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E

 This has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). It also avoids repeated letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

 Format: <guess> crane </guess><thinking>
As a first guess, I need a word that maximizes information by covering common letters and positions. A good starting word should include frequent vowels and consonants to reveal potential matches. Common choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ROAST"" because they contain multiple vowels and popular consonants.

After considering, ""CRANE"" is an excellent option:
- It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, providing broad coverage.
- C and R are frequent starters, while E is common in the end position.

This choice will generate rich feedback to inform subsequent guesses, regardless of the secret word.
</thinking>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

This means:
- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (because in ""crane"", R is in the second position, and it's marked as wrong position).
- A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains the letter R, but not as the second letter.
- Does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Since R is present but not in the second position, it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We have five positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Must be a valid five-letter word.
- Must avoid the letters C, A, N, E since they are not in the word.
- Must include the letter R somewhere, but not in the second position.

Additionally, we should aim to cover other common letters to gain more information.

Let's think about letters that are common in English and not yet tested. 
Common consonants: S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.
Vowels: We know E and A are out, so remaining vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

Considering R must be included, and avoiding position 2 for R.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5.

We should also use new letters to maximize information.

Possible new letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

A word that includes R and avoids C,A,N,E and places R not in the second position.

Examples: 
- R at start: words like ""ROAST"" but A is out -> not possible.
Since A is out, we need words without A.

Try ""RIGHT"": 
R (position 1), I, G, H, T. 
But we need to check if all are allowed? C,A,N,E out, so G,H,I,T are new.
This word is valid and has R in position 1 (which is allowed).

But wait, we have feedback that R is not in position 2, but position 1 is okay.

Another possibility: ""PROUD"" but P,R,O,U,D? But P is new? Yes, but note that positions: R would be in position 2? But the feedback says R is not in position 2? No: we must avoid R in position 2 because in the feedback R was in position 2 and marked wrong position, meaning in the secret word R is not in position 2. So in our next guess, we can put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are multiple R's. In the feedback, we had only one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. So at least one R exists, but we don't know about duplicates.

Since we are only at the second guess, we can assume one R for simplicity until contradicted.

Let me brainstorm some words without the forbidden letters (C,A,N,E) and with R not in position 2, and including other common letters.

Consider ""SPRIG"": but it has P,R,I,G,S? Positions: R is in position 3? 
But we must check forbidden letters: C,A,N,E none are in SPRIG? And we have R in position 3.

SPRIG: S, P, R (position 3), I, G.

But let me see: common words. Another: ""THROW"" has T,H,R,O,W? R in position 3? and avoids A,E,C,N? Yes.

""THROW"": T (1), H (2), R (3), O (4), W (5). And letters: T, H, R, O, W.

But note: the second position in our guess is H. We have no information about position 2 yet.

We could use a word that uses more vowels? Since A and E are out, we have I, O, U. Let me include one of them.

Another word: ""ROTIS"" (might not be common)? Let's think of common words.

A good word: ""FLIRT""? F,L,I,R,T. R is in position 4.

""FLIRT"": letters F,L,I,R,T. No forbidden letters. R is at position 4.

But maybe we can do better? We want to test several common letters.

Another: ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T. R at position 4? and no forbidden letters? This has O and S, P, T which are common.

Of course, ""SPORT"" has R in position 4? Let me spell: S-P-O-R-T, so position 4 is R? Then yes.

But note: the feedback does not forbid position 4, so that's okay.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that places R in position 1 to rule it out quickly.

For example: ""ROBOT""? But has B,O,T and R? But R is in position 1? Then O in position 2? But A and E are out, so O and I/U are the remaining vowels. However, the feedback doesn't forbid O in position 2.

But ""ROBOT"" has a repeated O? But that's acceptable? Also, we don't know if O is in the word or not.

To maximize new letters, we should avoid repeats.

Also, note that we are missing information about positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (since we only know R is not in position 2).

So, let me choose a word that:
- Starts with R (position 1) to test that position, and because R must be somewhere.
- Uses new common letters: T, O, L, S, etc.

Word: ""ROTLS""? Not a word. ""ROWTS""? Not common.

Common word: ""RISKY"" has I, S, K, Y? And R at the start.

But R is position 1.

""RISKY"": R (1), I (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). This avoids A,E,C,N? Yes? Then good.

But what about position 2? We don't know about I. Also, we need to test a vowel? I is a vowel.

Another common word: ""DRIPS""? But D, R, I, P, S? But D is new? And R at position 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know R is not in position 2? Is that true?

Clarify: we have a rule: R is present but not in position 2. Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be marked wrong position (because it's not correct). But we can do that? The feedback will tell us again that R is in wrong position? It might be redundant.

However, for our information, if we put R in position 2 again, and it gets marked as '-', that doesn't give us new information. We already know position 2 is wrong. So we should avoid position 2 for R to test other positions.

Therefore, in the next guess, R should be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We can set it in position 1 to check if it's correct there.

If we guess R in position 1 and it becomes correct (✓), then we know R is first letter. If it's marked '-', then we know R is not in position 1 either.

So to test position 1: put R at start.

Word: ""RUSTS""? But repeated? Avoid repeats if possible.

""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y. Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. R at position 1.

But U? We don't know.

""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids forbidden? Yes. But D and Y?

""ROGUE""? But E is forbidden -> doesn't work.

""ROBOT"": has O repeated? And B,O,T? 

But we might use a word without repeating letters.

""RAPID""? But A is out -> invalid.

""RINSE"" has N -> invalid because N is not in the word.

We don't have many options? 

Another: ""RIFTS"" - R,I,F,T,S. All distinct and new? F is a bit less common? 

But acceptable.

""RISKY"" as above: R, I, S, K, Y.

Let me choose ""RISKY"" because it uses common letters? Or ""ROBIN""? But N is forbidden -> not valid.

Wait, ""ROBIN"" has N -> we must avoid.

Another word: ""ROYAL""? But A -> invalid.

""PRIZE""? But Z and E -> E is out -> invalid.

""FLIRT"" as before: F,L,I,R,T - R in position 4? But we don't test position 1 then.

To maximize coverage of positions, we can try to set R in a new position and common letters.

Consider ""THIRD"": T,H,I,R,D? R in position 4? T,H,I,R,D.

That uses T and H, and I and D.

Also ""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R,T -> R in position 4? and S,H,I,T.

Now, that includes common consonants and a vowel I.

Similarly, ""SHIRT"" has letters S, H, I, R, T.

We want to test S, H, T which are common.

So, ""SHIRT"" might be a good candidate: 
- Includes R not in position 2 (here it's in position 4).
- Avoids forbidden letters: C,A,N,E.
- Uses new letters: S, H, I, T (and R again, but R we know is in).

But note: we need to see if these letters are likely.

We could use ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T -> O is a vowel we haven't tried? We haven't tried O or I. 

But ""SHIRT"" has the vowel I.

Another: ""STORM""? But M? And O? Let me see.

Wait, we don't have O tested? We should test O because it's a common vowel.

So consider ""SPORT"": 
- S (new), P (new), O (vowel), R (known), T (new). 
But R in position 4? So we are testing O and S, P, T.

Alternatively, ""GROUP"" but G,R,O,U,P? But U is a vowel? R in position 2? Wait, position 2: we cannot put R in position 2? Because R was marked wrong there. So GROUP has R in position 2 -> we shouldn't do that? Because we know it will be incorrect.

GROUP: G, R (2), O, U, P -> R at 2 is not allowed? The feedback would mark R as wrong position again? It doesn't break the rule, but it won't give us new information about R. So better to avoid.

Then avoid position 2 for R.

So, let me choose between:
- ""RISKY"": R at 1, I at 2, S,K,Y
- ""THIRD"": T,H,I (at 3), R at 4, D
- ""FLIRT"": F,L,I,R at 4, T
- ""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R at 4, T
- ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R at 4, T

But I like ""SHIRT"" because it covers S,H,I,T and R.

""SPORT"" adds O which is another common vowel? But O is not tested? Since we tested A,E (both out), testing O would be good.

So ""SPORT"" is maybe better? 

Let me see commonality: both valid.

But note: the secret word might have O? Without testing, we don't know.

In ""SHIRT"", we test I (vowel) and common consonants S,H,T.

We know R is in the word, so we are also testing position for R? In ""SPORT"" R is at position 4? Same in ""SHIRT""? Both are at position 4? Then we get information: if R is at position 4 and marked ✓, then it's correct. If marked '-', then R is not at position 4? But we know R is in the word, so it can be elsewhere.

Alternatively, we can put R at position 3? 

For example, ""TRIOS"": T,R at 2? No: T at 1, R at 2 -> cannot because R in position 2 is forbidden.

How about ""STRIP"": S,T,R? Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)? That way R is at position 3? And avoids position 2.

""STRIP"": S,T,R,I,P.

This uses S,T,R,I,P -> avoids forbidden? And R in position 3? 

Similarly, ""STRAP"" has A -> invalid.

So ""STRIP"" is okay? And it tests position 3 for R? And letters S,T,I,P.

I think ""STRIP"" is a good candidate: 
- Tests R at position 3 (new position).
- Tests new common letters: S, T, I, P.

Now, the feedback: 
In our first guess ""crane"", we ruled out A, E, N, C? And R is in word but not position 2. 

So we have 6 letters ruled out? But also, we know the word doesn't have A, E, N, C? So we have more freedom? Or less? 

Let me choose ""STRIP"".

Also, we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Another word: ""PRISM"" - P,R,I,S,M? But M? And positions: P(1), R(2) -> position 2? Avoid because R cannot be position 2? So ""PRISM"" has R at position 2: discard.

So my candidates: ""STRIP"", ""SHIRT"", ""SPORT"", ""RISKY"".

I think ""STRIP"" tests more letters? S, T, R, I, P? That's common.

Or ""SPORT"" tests O? 

But we haven't tested O? So testing O might be good? Because if O is in the word, we'll know.

But with ""STRIP"", we test I? That also a vowel? And I is more common than O? 

Actually, in English, E is most common, then A, then O, then I? So O is more common than I? 

According to some sources, letter frequency: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, etc. But we know R is in, and E,A,N are out? So O and I are the next common vowels? Actually O is more common than I? So to test O might be better? 

Let me see: O has about 7.5%, I has 6.9%? Slightly more O. 

But in any case, both important.

But with ""STRIP"", we get a chance to have R in a new position (3), and we test I (vowel) and S,T (common consonants).

With ""SPORT"", we test O (vowel) and S,P,T? And R at position 4? We don't get a new position for R? If we test position 3 or position 1 for R, that might be better? 

For example, if I set R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get '-', meaning R is not at 1, so we know it must be at 3,4, or 5? And the next guess we can avoid 1 and 2? 

Similarly, for position 3: if we test it and it's correct, we know; if not, we eliminate that position? 

Now, testing position 3 might be as good as position 1? 

But position 1 is the start, which is important? But also, R is common at the beginning? 

Considering that, let me try ""RISKY"" which tests R at position 1? 

Also, ""RISKY"" uses S,K,Y? Y is less common? So maybe not? 

Another word: ""RHYME""? But H,Y,M,E? E is forbidden -> invalid.

""ROUGH""? But G and H? And U? R at 1? 

But U is a vowel? We haven't tested U? 

We also have U? And Y? 

But for second guess, let's avoid rare letters? S, T, O, I, L, etc. are better? 

I think ""STRIP"" is good? Or ""SHORT""? 

""SHORT"": S,H,O,R,T? That's S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5? And it includes O? So we test O? And R at position 4? 

That avoids forbidden? C,A,N,E not in this word? 

Then ""SHORT"" tests S, H, O, R, T? R at position 4? 

But we are repeating R at position 4? In feedback? It may be marked - if position 4 is wrong? But we don't know? 

But position 4 might be correct? So it's worth testing? 

Since we haven't tested position 4? 

But in ""STRIP"", we test R at position 3? 

I think either is acceptable? 

But to decide: let me choose ""SHORT"" because it tests O? 

To avoid missing a common vowel? 

So ""SHORT""?

Similarly, ""SPORT"" is also good? Without H? 

Both? 

I think I'll go with ""STRIP"": it tests position 3 for R and covers S,T,R,I,P? I is a vowel? 

But O is more common? 

However, we already have R, so we don't need to test R itself? But we need to find its position? 

Perhaps in terms of probability? 

But given constraint, let me settle on ""SPORT"": 
why? It avoids the previously forbidden letters, includes R not in position 2 (here at 4), and tests two common consonants S,P,T and a vowel O? 

S and T are very common? So ""SPORT"" is good? 

Thus, my second guess: ""SPORT"".

<thinking>
From the first guess ""crane"", feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x). This eliminates C, A, N, E and indicates R is present but not in the second position.

For the next guess:
- Must include R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Must avoid C, A, N, E.
- Should explore new common letters (e.g., T, O, L, S, P, I) and positions.

Candidate words considered: 
- ""SHIRT"" (R at position 4; tests S, H, I, T).
- ""STRIP"" (R at position 3; tests S, T, R, I, P).
- ""SPORT"" (R at position 4; tests S, P, O, T).

Chose ""SPORT"" because:
- It includes O, a common vowel not yet tested.
- Uses common consonants S, P, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters and places R appropriately.
</thinking>

<guess>sport</guess><thinking>
Based on the previous feedback:
- Secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E
- Contains R, but not in position 2
- R must appear in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5

For next guess:
- Must include R, avoiding position 2
- Must omit C, A, N, E
- Should test new common letters: S, T, O, P, etc. to gain information
- Prioritize vowels (O) since A/E are eliminated

Chose ""SPORT"":
- Positions: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) → R safely in position 4
- Uses common letters S, P, O, T, testing O (vowel) and key consonants
- Valid English word, no conflicts

C,A,N,E out, so G,H,I,T are new.\nThis word is valid and has R in position 1 (which is allowed).\n\nBut wait, we have feedback that R is not in position 2, but position 1 is okay.\n\nAnother possibility: ""PROUD"" but P,R,O,U,D? But P is new? Yes, but note that positions: R would be in position 2? But the feedback says R is not in position 2? No: we must avoid R in position 2 because in the feedback R was in position 2 and marked wrong position, meaning in the secret word R is not in position 2. So in our next guess, we can put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if there are multiple R\'s. In the feedback, we had only one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. So at least one R exists, but we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nSince we are only at the second guess, we can assume one R for simplicity until contradicted.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words without the forbidden letters (C,A,N,E) and with R not in position 2, and including other common letters.\n\nConsider ""SPRIG"": but it has P,R,I,G,S? Positions: R is in position 3? \nBut we must check forbidden letters: C,A,N,E none are in SPRIG? And we have R in position 3.\n\nSPRIG: S, P, R (position 3), I, G.\n\nBut let me see: common words. Another: ""THROW"" has T,H,R,O,W? R in position 3? and avoids A,E,C,N? Yes.\n\n""THROW"": T (1), H (2), R (3), O (4), W (5). And letters: T, H, R, O, W.\n\nBut note: the second position in our guess is H. We have no information about position 2 yet.\n\nWe could use a word that uses more vowels? Since A and E are out, we have I, O, U. Let me include one of them.\n\nAnother word: ""ROTIS"" (might not be common)? Let\'s think of common words.\n\nA good word: ""FLIRT""? F,L,I,R,T. R is in position 4.\n\n""FLIRT"": letters F,L,I,R,T. No forbidden letters. R is at position 4.\n\nBut maybe we can do better? We want to test several common letters.\n\nAnother: ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T. R at position 4? and no forbidden letters? This has O and S, P, T which are common.\n\nOf course, ""SPORT"" has R in position 4? Let me spell: S-P-O-R-T, so position 4 is R? Then yes.\n\nBut note: the feedback does not forbid position 4, so that\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that places R in position 1 to rule it out quickly.\n\nFor example: ""ROBOT""? But has B,O,T and R? But R is in position 1? Then O in position 2? But A and E are out, so O and I/U are the remaining vowels. However, the feedback doesn\'t forbid O in position 2.\n\nBut ""ROBOT"" has a repeated O? But that\'s acceptable? Also, we don\'t know if O is in the word or not.\n\nTo maximize new letters, we should avoid repeats.\n\nAlso, note that we are missing information about positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (since we only know R is not in position 2).\n\nSo, let me choose a word that:\n- Starts with R (position 1) to test that position, and because R must be somewhere.\n- Uses new common letters: T, O, L, S, etc.\n\nWord: ""ROTLS""? Not a word. ""ROWTS""? Not common.\n\nCommon word: ""RISKY"" has I, S, K, Y? And R at the start.\n\nBut R is position 1.\n\n""RISKY"": R (1), I (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). This avoids A,E,C,N? Yes? Then good.\n\nBut what about position 2? We don\'t know about I. Also, we need to test a vowel? I is a vowel.\n\nAnother common word: ""DRIPS""? But D, R, I, P, S? But D is new? And R at position 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know R is not in position 2? Is that true?\n\nClarify: we have a rule: R is present but not in position 2. Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be marked wrong position (because it\'s not correct). But we can do that? The feedback will tell us again that R is in wrong position? It might be redundant.\n\nHowever, for our information, if we put R in position 2 again, and it gets marked as \'-\', that doesn\'t give us new information. We already know position 2 is wrong. So we should avoid position 2 for R to test other positions.\n\nTherefore, in the next guess, R should be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nWe can set it in position 1 to check if it\'s correct there.\n\nIf we guess R in position 1 and it becomes correct (✓), then we know R is first letter. If it\'s marked \'-\', then we know R is not in position 1 either.\n\nSo to test position 1: put R at start.\n\nWord: ""RUSTS""? But repeated? Avoid repeats if possible.\n\n""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y. Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. R at position 1.\n\nBut U? We don\'t know.\n\n""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids forbidden? Yes. But D and Y?\n\n""ROGUE""? But E is forbidden -> doesn\'t work.\n\n""ROBOT"": has O repeated? And B,O,T? \n\nBut we might use a word without repeating letters.\n\n""RAPID""? But A is out -> invalid.\n\n""RINSE"" has N -> invalid because N is not in the word.\n\nWe don\'t have many options? \n\nAnother: ""RIFTS"" - R,I,F,T,S. All distinct and new? F is a bit less common? \n\nBut acceptable.\n\n""RISKY"" as above: R, I, S, K, Y.\n\nLet me choose ""RISKY"" because it uses common letters? Or ""ROBIN""? But N is forbidden -> not valid.\n\nWait, ""ROBIN"" has N -> we must avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""ROYAL""? But A -> invalid.\n\n""PRIZE""? But Z and E -> E is out -> invalid.\n\n""FLIRT"" as before: F,L,I,R,T - R in position 4? But we don\'t test position 1 then.\n\nTo maximize coverage of positions, we can try to set R in a new position and common letters.\n\nConsider ""THIRD"": T,H,I,R,D? R in position 4? T,H,I,R,D.\n\nThat uses T and H, and I and D.\n\nAlso ""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R,T -> R in position 4? and S,H,I,T.\n\nNow, that includes common consonants and a vowel I.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHIRT"" has letters S, H, I, R, T.\n\nWe want to test S, H, T which are common.\n\nSo, ""SHIRT"" might be a good candidate: \n- Includes R not in position 2 (here it\'s in position 4).\n- Avoids forbidden letters: C,A,N,E.\n- Uses new letters: S, H, I, T (and R again, but R we know is in).\n\nBut note: we need to see if these letters are likely.\n\nWe could use ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T -> O is a vowel we haven\'t tried? We haven\'t tried O or I. \n\nBut ""SHIRT"" has the vowel I.\n\nAnother: ""STORM""? But M? And O? Let me see.\n\nWait, we don\'t have O tested? We should test O because it\'s a common vowel.\n\nSo consider ""SPORT"": \n- S (new), P (new), O (vowel), R (known), T (new). \nBut R in position 4? So we are testing O and S, P, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""GROUP"" but G,R,O,U,P? But U is a vowel? R in position 2? Wait, position 2: we cannot put R in position 2? Because R was marked wrong there. So GROUP has R in position 2 -> we shouldn\'t do that? Because we know it will be incorrect.\n\nGROUP: G, R (2), O, U, P -> R at 2 is not allowed? The feedback would mark R as wrong position again? It doesn\'t break the rule, but it won\'t give us new information about R. So better to avoid.\n\nThen avoid position 2 for R.\n\nSo, let me choose between:\n- ""RISKY"": R at 1, I at 2, S,K,Y\n- ""THIRD"": T,H,I (at 3), R at 4, D\n- ""FLIRT"": F,L,I,R at 4, T\n- ""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R at 4, T\n- ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R at 4, T\n\nBut I like ""SHIRT"" because it covers S,H,I,T and R.\n\n""SPORT"" adds O which is another common vowel? But O is not tested? Since we tested A,E (both out), testing O would be good.\n\nSo ""SPORT"" is maybe better? \n\nLet me see commonality: both valid.\n\nBut note: the secret word might have O?

And letters S,T,I,P.\n\nI think ""STRIP"" is a good candidate: \n- Tests R at position 3 (new position).\n- Tests new common letters: S, T, I, P.\n\nNow, the feedback: \nIn our first guess ""crane"", we ruled out A, E, N, C?

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning: 
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

Guess 2: sport -> S(x), P(x), O(x), R(-), T(x)
Meaning:
- S, P, O, T are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""sport"", R is in position 4 and marked as '-', meaning wrong position).

Now, combining the information:
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T
- R must be in the word, and now we know it cannot be in position 2 (from first guess) or position 4 (from second guess). So possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 5.

Also, the secret word must be composed of letters not eliminated. The available letters are all except C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.

Alphabet: A to Z
Eliminated: A, C, E, N, O, P, T, S
So remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: R is already known to be in the word.

We must form a 5-letter word using the remaining letters, including R (which must be in position 1, 3, or 5), and avoiding the eliminated letters.

Also, the word must be valid English.

Possible words? Since we have only a few positions to try.

Moreover, we have only used two guesses, so we have 4 left? 6 total.

We need to test: position for R and also other letters.

Since R must be in 1, 3, or 5, we can try to put R at position 1? Or perhaps use a word that tests multiple possibilities.

We should also test other common letters from the remaining set? Such as I, L, U, etc.

But note: we don't know what vowels are left? Available vowels: I, U, and sometimes Y? Since A, E, O are eliminated.

So the word must contain vowels? And I and U are the main options? Plus Y.

So we need a word with R in position 1, 3, or 5, and using only letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But without the eliminated ones.

We can break down:

Common remaining letters: R (must include), B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U, Y

We should try to cover as many of these as possible in one guess? But priority: find where R is.

If we put R at position 1, we test position 1? If it's correct, we know. If not, it will be in 3 or 5? So we narrow.

Similarly, position 3? 

But let me think of common words that start with R and use the allowed letters.

Possible word: ""RULER""? But E and R repeated? E is eliminated -> invalid.

""RIGID""? Has D? But positions: R at 1, I at 2? Then G,I,D? But D? Eliminated letters? E is out, but D is available? And also repeated I? 

""RIGID"": R at 1, I, G, I, D? Letters: R,I,G,D? I repeated? Also available, but we might avoid repeats? Not necessary, but the word is valid? However, we have other options.

But D is still available? And not tested? 

However, we want to maximize new letters? 

Another: ""RAINY""? A is eliminated? Not valid.

""RUDER""? Has E? Invalid.

""FRUIT""? F and R: but position of R? F,R,U,I,T? But T is eliminated? From sport T(x), so T is out? Cannot use T? 

We also have to avoid eliminated letters: T is out? Yes, from guess 2.

Similarly, in ""fruit"", T would be eliminated? But ""fruit"" has T at the end? T is eliminated? So ""fruit"" invalid.

Another word: ""LYRIC""? But L, Y, R, I, C? C is eliminated? Invalid.

""BRINK""? B,R,I,N,K? N is eliminated? From crane N(x) -> invalid.

""GRIMY""? G,R,I,M,Y? Letters: G,R,I,M,Y? All allowed? Because G,R,I,M,Y not eliminated? 

Eliminated: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T? So G is allowed, R allowed, I allowed, M allowed, Y allowed? 

Yes.

Positions: G at 1, R at 2? But we know R cannot be in position 2? From first guess, R must not be position 2? But guess 2 doesn't change that? So if we put R in position 2, it will be wrong position? Because earlier it was position 2 and marked wrong.

In ""GRIMY"", R is at position 2? So that position is wrong? We cannot set R at 2? And it will not change? 

Therefore, avoid position 2 for R? 

So ""GRIMY"": G(1), R(2) but position 2 is wrong? So R(2) will be marked '-' again? But we know that? So it doesn't help? 

But if we change to put R at position 3? 

For example, ""BIRCH""? But H? And C? C eliminated? Invalid.

Word: ""URBAN""? But A eliminated? Invalid.

""CURVE""? C eliminated? Invalid.

We need a word with R in 1, 3, or 5.

For example: 
- R in position 1: ""R...."" 
  No A,E,O,S,P,T? Available: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But without eliminated.

So ""R...."" can be: R U L E R? But E eliminated? No.

""RHYME""? But E eliminated? No.

""RUMOR""? O eliminated? And repeated O? O is out? So invalid.

""RIDER""? D,E,R? E out? Invalid.

""RISER""? S,E? Out? Invalid.

""RIVER""? E? Out? And R repeated? Not valid.

""RIDER"" invalid.

""RUBY"" only 4? Must 5 letters? ""RUBY"" is 4.

""RUDDY""? D repeated and Y? But D,Y allowed? And U? ""RUDDY"": R,U,D,D,Y? Letter not eliminated: U,D,Y? R? A 5-letter word? 

But D repeated? 

But is U allowed? Yes.

But we have to check if valid? ""RUDDY"" is a word.

But R in position 1? Then U(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5)? 

But R is in position 1? We are testing if R is in position 1?

Also, letters used: R,U,D,Y? D repeated? Actually, D and D? Same letter.

But the word contains U and Y? Vowels? 

But note: R in position 1? 

We could use ""ROWER""? O out? Invalid.

""ROWDY""? O out? Invalid.

""READY""? E,A out? Invalid.

Hard to find R at 1? 

Let's try R at position 3? So ""_ _ R _ _""

For example: B I R T H? T out? Invalid.

C A R D S? Multiple eliminated? Invalid.

H A R K? K? But H,A,R,K? A out? Invalid.

F I R S T? S,T out? Invalid, S and T eliminated.

B U R K A? A out? Invalid.

Another: M I R T H? T,H? But T out? Invalid.

B I R S T? S,T out? Invalid.

W E R E S? E,S out? Invalid.

U R I N E? U,R,I,N,E? N,E out? Invalid.

This is difficult.

Position 5: R at the end? ""...R""

For example: ...R

Words: A Z U R E? A out? Invalid.

L I Q U R? Q and R? Valid? Liquor? But that's LIQUOR? O is eliminated? From sport O(x)? So O not, invalid.

Also, L,I,Q,U,R? Positions: L(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), R(5)? 

Q and U? But is Q allowed? It's not eliminated? 

Letters available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And R.

""LIQUOR"": but LIQUOR has an O? Wait, spelling: L-I-Q-U-O-R? O at position 5? Wait, no: positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:Q, 4:U, 5:O, R? But ""LIQUOR"" is 6 letters? Mistake.

""L I Q U O R"" is 6 letters.

""LIQUR""? Not a word.

"" F L O O R""? O out? Invalid.

"" G L A R E""? A,E out? Invalid.

"" S C A R E""? Multiple out? Invalid.

 R in position 5: ""B R I A R""? A out? Invalid.

"" F I B R E""? E out? Invalid.

P R I O R? O out? Invalid.

H U M O R? O out? Invalid.

But we need a vowel? U or I or Y.

Word: "" F L U R R""? Not common? Flurr? Not a word.

"" B L U R R""? Valid? Blurr? Or blur? Not 5 letters.

"" P L U R L""? Not a word.

"" D E M U R""? E out? Invalid.

Perhaps "" B U G L R""? Not a word.

Maybe we have to use Y? Like "" M U R K Y""? M,U,R,K,Y? Positions: M(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5)? 

Letters: M,U,R,K,Y? Also, U at position 2, R at position 3? R in position 3? Which is possible? 

And all letters allowed? Eliminated: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T? None of M,U,R,K,Y are eliminated? M allowed, U allowed, R allowed, K allowed, Y allowed? 

""MURKY"" is a valid word: meaning dark and dirty? 

Yes! Also, U is a vowel? And R at position 3? 

So that satisfies: R not in 2 or 4? Here it is in position 3? Could be correct? 

We test position 3 for R? And also test M,U,K,Y? 

Another possibility: ""LURID""? L,U,R,I,D? 
L(1), U(2), R(3), I(4), D(5)? R at position 3? 
Letters L,U,R,I,D? All not eliminated? 

""LURID"" is a word? Yes.

But which to choose? ""MURKY"" or ""LURID""? 

Both have R at position 3? 

""LURID"": also tests I and D? 

But we also need to cover vowel? Both have U? 

Since we have many unknowns, we need to test as many new letters as possible? 

In ""MURKY"", letters: M,U,R,K,Y -> M,U,K,Y new? R we know? In ""LURID"": L,U,R,I,D -> L,U,I,D new? 

In guess 2, we didn't use K or Y, so they are new? 

I think both are valid? 

We could choose ""MURKY"": to test K and Y? 

But I is a common vowel? ""LURID"" tests I? 

However, with E,A,O out, I and U are important vowels? 

So ""LURID"" tests I at position 4? 

Also, D? Which is common consonant? 

So ""LURID"" tests: L,U,D,R,I? R known? But positions: we test U at position 2? 

Another: in ""LURID"", U is at position 2? We don't know about position 2? 

Similarly, in ""MURKY"", U at position 2? 

So both words? 

I think ""MURKY"" uses K and Y which are less common? So ""LURID"" might be better? 

But let's also think: we need to avoid? 

Another word: "" BUILD""? B,U,I,L,D? But R not included? We must include R? Secret word has R? So our guess must include R? Because we know R is in? 

Important: we cannot omit R? Because it must be in the word? 

So any guess must contain R? 

Both ""LURID"" and ""MURKY"" contain R? 

""FJORD""? O? O is out? From sport O(x)? So invalid? 

""QUIRK""? Q,U,I,R,K? Positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), R(4), K(5)? But R in position 4? 

We know R is not in position 4? Because from guess 2, sport at position 4 R(-) so wrong position? So if we put R at position 4 again, it will again be '-'? 

So do not put R at position 4? We must avoid positions 2 and 4 for R? 

Therefore, ""QUIRK"" has R at position 4? So it would be marked '-'? But we know that? So it doesn't help? 

Similarly, we should avoid position 4 for R? 

In ""MURKY"": R at position 3? Clear? Avoids position 4? 
In ""LURID"": position 3? Good? 

What about R at position 1? Like ""RUDDY"" ? But it has D repeated? 

"" R U M B A""? A out? Invalid.

"" R H Y M E""? E out? Invalid.

"" R U I N S""? S out? Invalid.

So ""LURID"" and ""MURKY"" are best? 

I think I'll go with ""LURID"" because it uses more common letters: L, I, D? Compared to K and Y? 

Also, ""LURID"" has U and I, two vowels? 

So guess: ""LURID""? 

Confirmation: 
L: position 1? Not tested before? 
U: position 2? Test? 
R: position 3? 
I: position 4? 
D: position 5? 

Letters: L,U,R,I,D? All not eliminated? And R must be in word? 

Yes. 

Alternatively, ""GUILD""? But no R? Must include R? 

So ""LURID"" seems valid? 

Final decision: guess ""LURID"".

Previous Feedback Summary:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): Eliminated C, A, N, E. R present but not in position 2.
- Guess 2 (""sport""): Eliminated S, P, O, T. R present but not in position 4.

Key Insights:
- Eliminated letters: A, C, E, N, O, P, S, T.
- R must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 2 or 4. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.
- Remaining available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Given vowel elimination (A, E, O out), likely vowels are I or U (or Y).
- Next guess must include R in position 1, 3, or 5 and avoid eliminated letters.

For this guess:
- Prioritize confirming R's position while testing new common letters (e.g., I, U, L, D).
- ""lurid"" selected because:
  - Valid 5-letter English word.
  - Places R in position 3 (avoiding positions 2/4).
  - Uses new letters: L, U, I, D (all untested and available).
  - Covers vowels I and U, key for word constraints.
  - Tests multiple positions, balancing between gathering new info and narrowing possibilities.

So ""LURID"" tests: L,U,D,R,I? R known? But positions: we test U at position 2? 

Another: in ""LURID"", U is at position 2? We don't know about position 2? 

Similarly, in ""MURKY"", U at position 2? 

So both words? 

I think ""MURKY"" uses K and Y which are less common? So ""LURID"" might be better? 

But let's also think: we need to avoid? 

Another word: "" BUILD""? B,U,I,L,D? But R not included? We must include R? Secret word has R? So our guess must include R? Because we know R is in? 

Important: we cannot omit R? Because it must be in the word? 

So any guess must contain R? 

Both ""LURID"" and ""MURKY"" contain R? 

""FJORD""? O? O is out? From sport O(x)? So invalid? 

""QUIRK""? Q,U,I,R,K? Positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), R(4), K(5)? But R in position 4? 

We know R is not in position 4? Because from guess 2, sport at position 4 R(-) so wrong position? So if we put R at position 4 again, it will again be '-'? 

So do not put R at position 4? We must avoid positions 2 and 4 for R? 

Therefore, ""QUIRK"" has R at position 4? So it would be marked '-'? But we know that? So it doesn't help? 

Similarly, we should avoid position 4 for R? 

In ""MURKY"": R at position 3? Clear? Avoids position 4? 
In ""LURID"": position 3? Good? 

What about R at position 1? Like ""RUDDY"" ? But it has D repeated? 

"" R U M B A""? A out? Invalid.

"" R H Y M E""? E out? Invalid.

"" R U I N S""? S out? Invalid.

So ""LURID"" and ""MURKY"" are best? 

I think I'll go with ""LURID"" because it uses more common letters: L, I, D? Compared to K and Y? 

Also, ""LURID"" has U and I, two vowels? 

So guess: ""LURID""? 

Confirmation: 
L: position 1? Not tested before? 
U: position 2? Test? 
R: position 3? 
I: position 4? 
D: position 5? 

Letters: L,U,R,I,D? All not eliminated? And R must be in word? 

Yes. 

Alternatively, ""GUILD""? But no R? Must include R? 

So ""LURID"" seems valid? 

Final decision: guess ""LURID"".<thinking>
Previous Feedback Summary:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): Eliminated C, A, N, E. R present but not in position 2.
- Guess 2 (""sport""): Eliminated S, P, O, T. R present but not in position 4.

Key Insights:
- Eliminated letters: A, C, E, N, O, P, S, T.
- R must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 2 or 4. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.
- Remaining available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Given vowel elimination (A, E, O out), likely vowels are I or U (or Y).
- Next guess must include R in position 1, 3, or 5 and avoid eliminated letters.

For this guess:
- Prioritize confirming R's position while testing new common letters (e.g., I, U, L, D).
- ""lurid"" selected because:
  - Valid 5-letter English word.
  - Places R in position 3 (avoiding positions 2/4).
  - Uses new letters: L, U, I, D (all untested and available).
  - Covers vowels I and U, key for word constraints.
  - Tests multiple positions, balancing between gathering new info and narrowing possibilities.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. We have no prior information. A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).
 The word ""SLATE"" is often a good starter because it has two common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (S, L, T). Alternatively, ""CRANE"" or ""ROATE"" (though ROATE is less common but used in Wordle).

 However, to be safe, let's choose a word that is definitely a valid English word and covers multiple common letters.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"": 
   C, R, A, N, E

 This has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). It also avoids repeated letters.

 So, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

 Format: <guess> crane </guess><thinking>
As a first guess, I need a word that maximizes information by covering common letters and positions. A good starting word should include frequent vowels and consonants to reveal potential matches. Common choices are words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""ROAST"" because they contain multiple vowels and popular consonants.

After considering, ""CRANE"" is an excellent option:
- It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N).
- All letters are distinct, providing broad coverage.
- C and R are frequent starters, while E is common in the end position.

This choice will generate rich feedback to inform subsequent guesses, regardless of the secret word.
</thinking>

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": 
C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)

This means:
- C is not in the secret word at all.
- R is in the secret word but not in the second position (because in ""crane"", R is in the second position, and it's marked as wrong position).
- A, N, and E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Contains the letter R, but not as the second letter.
- Does not contain C, A, N, or E.

Since R is present but not in the second position, it could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We have five positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Must be a valid five-letter word.
- Must avoid the letters C, A, N, E since they are not in the word.
- Must include the letter R somewhere, but not in the second position.

Additionally, we should aim to cover other common letters to gain more information.

Let's think about letters that are common in English and not yet tested. 
Common consonants: S, T, L, B, D, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, etc.
Vowels: We know E and A are out, so remaining vowels: I, O, U (and sometimes Y).

Considering R must be included, and avoiding position 2 for R.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5.

We should also use new letters to maximize information.

Possible new letters: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

A word that includes R and avoids C,A,N,E and places R not in the second position.

Examples: 
- R at start: words like ""ROAST"" but A is out -> not possible.
Since A is out, we need words without A.

Try ""RIGHT"": 
R (position 1), I, G, H, T. 
But we need to check if all are allowed? C,A,N,E out, so G,H,I,T are new.
This word is valid and has R in position 1 (which is allowed).

But wait, we have feedback that R is not in position 2, but position 1 is okay.

Another possibility: ""PROUD"" but P,R,O,U,D? But P is new? Yes, but note that positions: R would be in position 2? But the feedback says R is not in position 2? No: we must avoid R in position 2 because in the feedback R was in position 2 and marked wrong position, meaning in the secret word R is not in position 2. So in our next guess, we can put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are multiple R's. In the feedback, we had only one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. So at least one R exists, but we don't know about duplicates.

Since we are only at the second guess, we can assume one R for simplicity until contradicted.

Let me brainstorm some words without the forbidden letters (C,A,N,E) and with R not in position 2, and including other common letters.

Consider ""SPRIG"": but it has P,R,I,G,S? Positions: R is in position 3? 
But we must check forbidden letters: C,A,N,E none are in SPRIG? And we have R in position 3.

SPRIG: S, P, R (position 3), I, G.

But let me see: common words. Another: ""THROW"" has T,H,R,O,W? R in position 3? and avoids A,E,C,N? Yes.

""THROW"": T (1), H (2), R (3), O (4), W (5). And letters: T, H, R, O, W.

But note: the second position in our guess is H. We have no information about position 2 yet.

We could use a word that uses more vowels? Since A and E are out, we have I, O, U. Let me include one of them.

Another word: ""ROTIS"" (might not be common)? Let's think of common words.

A good word: ""FLIRT""? F,L,I,R,T. R is in position 4.

""FLIRT"": letters F,L,I,R,T. No forbidden letters. R is at position 4.

But maybe we can do better? We want to test several common letters.

Another: ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T. R at position 4? and no forbidden letters? This has O and S, P, T which are common.

Of course, ""SPORT"" has R in position 4? Let me spell: S-P-O-R-T, so position 4 is R? Then yes.

But note: the feedback does not forbid position 4, so that's okay.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that places R in position 1 to rule it out quickly.

For example: ""ROBOT""? But has B,O,T and R? But R is in position 1? Then O in position 2? But A and E are out, so O and I/U are the remaining vowels. However, the feedback doesn't forbid O in position 2.

But ""ROBOT"" has a repeated O? But that's acceptable? Also, we don't know if O is in the word or not.

To maximize new letters, we should avoid repeats.

Also, note that we are missing information about positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (since we only know R is not in position 2).

So, let me choose a word that:
- Starts with R (position 1) to test that position, and because R must be somewhere.
- Uses new common letters: T, O, L, S, etc.

Word: ""ROTLS""? Not a word. ""ROWTS""? Not common.

Common word: ""RISKY"" has I, S, K, Y? And R at the start.

But R is position 1.

""RISKY"": R (1), I (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). This avoids A,E,C,N? Yes? Then good.

But what about position 2? We don't know about I. Also, we need to test a vowel? I is a vowel.

Another common word: ""DRIPS""? But D, R, I, P, S? But D is new? And R at position 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know R is not in position 2? Is that true?

Clarify: we have a rule: R is present but not in position 2. Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be marked wrong position (because it's not correct). But we can do that? The feedback will tell us again that R is in wrong position? It might be redundant.

However, for our information, if we put R in position 2 again, and it gets marked as '-', that doesn't give us new information. We already know position 2 is wrong. So we should avoid position 2 for R to test other positions.

Therefore, in the next guess, R should be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.

We can set it in position 1 to check if it's correct there.

If we guess R in position 1 and it becomes correct (✓), then we know R is first letter. If it's marked '-', then we know R is not in position 1 either.

So to test position 1: put R at start.

Word: ""RUSTS""? But repeated? Avoid repeats if possible.

""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y. Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. R at position 1.

But U? We don't know.

""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids forbidden? Yes. But D and Y?

""ROGUE""? But E is forbidden -> doesn't work.

""ROBOT"": has O repeated? And B,O,T? 

But we might use a word without repeating letters.

""RAPID""? But A is out -> invalid.

""RINSE"" has N -> invalid because N is not in the word.

We don't have many options? 

Another: ""RIFTS"" - R,I,F,T,S. All distinct and new? F is a bit less common? 

But acceptable.

""RISKY"" as above: R, I, S, K, Y.

Let me choose ""RISKY"" because it uses common letters? Or ""ROBIN""? But N is forbidden -> not valid.

Wait, ""ROBIN"" has N -> we must avoid.

Another word: ""ROYAL""? But A -> invalid.

""PRIZE""? But Z and E -> E is out -> invalid.

""FLIRT"" as before: F,L,I,R,T - R in position 4? But we don't test position 1 then.

To maximize coverage of positions, we can try to set R in a new position and common letters.

Consider ""THIRD"": T,H,I,R,D? R in position 4? T,H,I,R,D.

That uses T and H, and I and D.

Also ""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R,T -> R in position 4? and S,H,I,T.

Now, that includes common consonants and a vowel I.

Similarly, ""SHIRT"" has letters S, H, I, R, T.

We want to test S, H, T which are common.

So, ""SHIRT"" might be a good candidate: 
- Includes R not in position 2 (here it's in position 4).
- Avoids forbidden letters: C,A,N,E.
- Uses new letters: S, H, I, T (and R again, but R we know is in).

But note: we need to see if these letters are likely.

We could use ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T -> O is a vowel we haven't tried? We haven't tried O or I. 

But ""SHIRT"" has the vowel I.

Another: ""STORM""? But M? And O? Let me see.

Wait, we don't have O tested? We should test O because it's a common vowel.

So consider ""SPORT"": 
- S (new), P (new), O (vowel), R (known), T (new). 
But R in position 4? So we are testing O and S, P, T.

Alternatively, ""GROUP"" but G,R,O,U,P? But U is a vowel? R in position 2? Wait, position 2: we cannot put R in position 2? Because R was marked wrong there. So GROUP has R in position 2 -> we shouldn't do that? Because we know it will be incorrect.

GROUP: G, R (2), O, U, P -> R at 2 is not allowed? The feedback would mark R as wrong position again? It doesn't break the rule, but it won't give us new information about R. So better to avoid.

Then avoid position 2 for R.

So, let me choose between:
- ""RISKY"": R at 1, I at 2, S,K,Y
- ""THIRD"": T,H,I (at 3), R at 4, D
- ""FLIRT"": F,L,I,R at 4, T
- ""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R at 4, T
- ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R at 4, T

But I like ""SHIRT"" because it covers S,H,I,T and R.

""SPORT"" adds O which is another common vowel? But O is not tested? Since we tested A,E (both out), testing O would be good.

So ""SPORT"" is maybe better? 

Let me see commonality: both valid.

But note: the secret word might have O? Without testing, we don't know.

In ""SHIRT"", we test I (vowel) and common consonants S,H,T.

We know R is in the word, so we are also testing position for R? In ""SPORT"" R is at position 4? Same in ""SHIRT""? Both are at position 4? Then we get information: if R is at position 4 and marked ✓, then it's correct. If marked '-', then R is not at position 4? But we know R is in the word, so it can be elsewhere.

Alternatively, we can put R at position 3? 

For example, ""TRIOS"": T,R at 2? No: T at 1, R at 2 -> cannot because R in position 2 is forbidden.

How about ""STRIP"": S,T,R? Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)? That way R is at position 3? And avoids position 2.

""STRIP"": S,T,R,I,P.

This uses S,T,R,I,P -> avoids forbidden? And R in position 3? 

Similarly, ""STRAP"" has A -> invalid.

So ""STRIP"" is okay? And it tests position 3 for R? And letters S,T,I,P.

I think ""STRIP"" is a good candidate: 
- Tests R at position 3 (new position).
- Tests new common letters: S, T, I, P.

Now, the feedback: 
In our first guess ""crane"", we ruled out A, E, N, C? And R is in word but not position 2. 

So we have 6 letters ruled out? But also, we know the word doesn't have A, E, N, C? So we have more freedom? Or less? 

Let me choose ""STRIP"".

Also, we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.

Another word: ""PRISM"" - P,R,I,S,M? But M? And positions: P(1), R(2) -> position 2? Avoid because R cannot be position 2? So ""PRISM"" has R at position 2: discard.

So my candidates: ""STRIP"", ""SHIRT"", ""SPORT"", ""RISKY"".

I think ""STRIP"" tests more letters? S, T, R, I, P? That's common.

Or ""SPORT"" tests O? 

But we haven't tested O? So testing O might be good? Because if O is in the word, we'll know.

But with ""STRIP"", we test I? That also a vowel? And I is more common than O? 

Actually, in English, E is most common, then A, then O, then I? So O is more common than I? 

According to some sources, letter frequency: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, etc. But we know R is in, and E,A,N are out? So O and I are the next common vowels? Actually O is more common than I? So to test O might be better? 

Let me see: O has about 7.5%, I has 6.9%? Slightly more O. 

But in any case, both important.

But with ""STRIP"", we get a chance to have R in a new position (3), and we test I (vowel) and S,T (common consonants).

With ""SPORT"", we test O (vowel) and S,P,T? And R at position 4? We don't get a new position for R? If we test position 3 or position 1 for R, that might be better? 

For example, if I set R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get '-', meaning R is not at 1, so we know it must be at 3,4, or 5? And the next guess we can avoid 1 and 2? 

Similarly, for position 3: if we test it and it's correct, we know; if not, we eliminate that position? 

Now, testing position 3 might be as good as position 1? 

But position 1 is the start, which is important? But also, R is common at the beginning? 

Considering that, let me try ""RISKY"" which tests R at position 1? 

Also, ""RISKY"" uses S,K,Y? Y is less common? So maybe not? 

Another word: ""RHYME""? But H,Y,M,E? E is forbidden -> invalid.

""ROUGH""? But G and H? And U? R at 1? 

But U is a vowel? We haven't tested U? 

We also have U? And Y? 

But for second guess, let's avoid rare letters? S, T, O, I, L, etc. are better? 

I think ""STRIP"" is good? Or ""SHORT""? 

""SHORT"": S,H,O,R,T? That's S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5? And it includes O? So we test O? And R at position 4? 

That avoids forbidden? C,A,N,E not in this word? 

Then ""SHORT"" tests S, H, O, R, T? R at position 4? 

But we are repeating R at position 4? In feedback? It may be marked - if position 4 is wrong? But we don't know? 

But position 4 might be correct? So it's worth testing? 

Since we haven't tested position 4? 

But in ""STRIP"", we test R at position 3? 

I think either is acceptable? 

But to decide: let me choose ""SHORT"" because it tests O? 

To avoid missing a common vowel? 

So ""SHORT""?

Similarly, ""SPORT"" is also good? Without H? 

Both? 

I think I'll go with ""STRIP"": it tests position 3 for R and covers S,T,R,I,P? I is a vowel? 

But O is more common? 

However, we already have R, so we don't need to test R itself? But we need to find its position? 

Perhaps in terms of probability? 

But given constraint, let me settle on ""SPORT"": 
why? It avoids the previously forbidden letters, includes R not in position 2 (here at 4), and tests two common consonants S,P,T and a vowel O? 

S and T are very common? So ""SPORT"" is good? 

Thus, my second guess: ""SPORT"".

<thinking>
From the first guess ""crane"", feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x). This eliminates C, A, N, E and indicates R is present but not in the second position.

For the next guess:
- Must include R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
- Must avoid C, A, N, E.
- Should explore new common letters (e.g., T, O, L, S, P, I) and positions.

Candidate words considered: 
- ""SHIRT"" (R at position 4; tests S, H, I, T).
- ""STRIP"" (R at position 3; tests S, T, R, I, P).
- ""SPORT"" (R at position 4; tests S, P, O, T).

Chose ""SPORT"" because:
- It includes O, a common vowel not yet tested.
- Uses common consonants S, P, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters and places R appropriately.
</thinking>

<guess>sport</guess><thinking>
Based on the previous feedback:
- Secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E
- Contains R, but not in position 2
- R must appear in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5

For next guess:
- Must include R, avoiding position 2
- Must omit C, A, N, E
- Should test new common letters: S, T, O, P, etc. to gain information
- Prioritize vowels (O) since A/E are eliminated

Chose ""SPORT"":
- Positions: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) → R safely in position 4
- Uses common letters S, P, O, T, testing O (vowel) and key consonants
- Valid English word, no conflicts
</thinking>

<guess>sport</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Meaning: 
- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 2.

Guess 2: sport -> S(x), P(x), O(x), R(-), T(x)
Meaning:
- S, P, O, T are not in the word at all.
- R is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""sport"", R is in position 4 and marked as '-', meaning wrong position).

Now, combining the information:
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T
- R must be in the word, and now we know it cannot be in position 2 (from first guess) or position 4 (from second guess). So possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 5.

Also, the secret word must be composed of letters not eliminated. The available letters are all except C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.

Alphabet: A to Z
Eliminated: A, C, E, N, O, P, T, S
So remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: R is already known to be in the word.

We must form a 5-letter word using the remaining letters, including R (which must be in position 1, 3, or 5), and avoiding the eliminated letters.

Also, the word must be valid English.

Possible words? Since we have only a few positions to try.

Moreover, we have only used two guesses, so we have 4 left? 6 total.

We need to test: position for R and also other letters.

Since R must be in 1, 3, or 5, we can try to put R at position 1? Or perhaps use a word that tests multiple possibilities.

We should also test other common letters from the remaining set? Such as I, L, U, etc.

But note: we don't know what vowels are left? Available vowels: I, U, and sometimes Y? Since A, E, O are eliminated.

So the word must contain vowels? And I and U are the main options? Plus Y.

So we need a word with R in position 1, 3, or 5, and using only letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But without the eliminated ones.

We can break down:

Common remaining letters: R (must include), B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U, Y

We should try to cover as many of these as possible in one guess? But priority: find where R is.

If we put R at position 1, we test position 1? If it's correct, we know. If not, it will be in 3 or 5? So we narrow.

Similarly, position 3? 

But let me think of common words that start with R and use the allowed letters.

Possible word: ""RULER""? But E and R repeated? E is eliminated -> invalid.

""RIGID""? Has D? But positions: R at 1, I at 2? Then G,I,D? But D? Eliminated letters? E is out, but D is available? And also repeated I? 

""RIGID"": R at 1, I, G, I, D? Letters: R,I,G,D? I repeated? Also available, but we might avoid repeats? Not necessary, but the word is valid? However, we have other options.

But D is still available? And not tested? 

However, we want to maximize new letters? 

Another: ""RAINY""? A is eliminated? Not valid.

""RUDER""? Has E? Invalid.

""FRUIT""? F and R: but position of R? F,R,U,I,T? But T is eliminated? From sport T(x), so T is out? Cannot use T? 

We also have to avoid eliminated letters: T is out? Yes, from guess 2.

Similarly, in ""fruit"", T would be eliminated? But ""fruit"" has T at the end? T is eliminated? So ""fruit"" invalid.

Another word: ""LYRIC""? But L, Y, R, I, C? C is eliminated? Invalid.

""BRINK""? B,R,I,N,K? N is eliminated? From crane N(x) -> invalid.

""GRIMY""? G,R,I,M,Y? Letters: G,R,I,M,Y? All allowed? Because G,R,I,M,Y not eliminated? 

Eliminated: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T? So G is allowed, R allowed, I allowed, M allowed, Y allowed? 

Yes.

Positions: G at 1, R at 2? But we know R cannot be in position 2? From first guess, R must not be position 2? But guess 2 doesn't change that? So if we put R in position 2, it will be wrong position? Because earlier it was position 2 and marked wrong.

In ""GRIMY"", R is at position 2? So that position is wrong? We cannot set R at 2? And it will not change? 

Therefore, avoid position 2 for R? 

So ""GRIMY"": G(1), R(2) but position 2 is wrong? So R(2) will be marked '-' again? But we know that? So it doesn't help? 

But if we change to put R at position 3? 

For example, ""BIRCH""? But H? And C? C eliminated? Invalid.

Word: ""URBAN""? But A eliminated? Invalid.

""CURVE""? C eliminated? Invalid.

We need a word with R in 1, 3, or 5.

For example: 
- R in position 1: ""R...."" 
  No A,E,O,S,P,T? Available: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But without eliminated.

So ""R...."" can be: R U L E R? But E eliminated? No.

""RHYME""? But E eliminated? No.

""RUMOR""? O eliminated? And repeated O? O is out? So invalid.

""RIDER""? D,E,R? E out? Invalid.

""RISER""? S,E? Out? Invalid.

""RIVER""? E? Out? And R repeated? Not valid.

""RIDER"" invalid.

""RUBY"" only 4? Must 5 letters? ""RUBY"" is 4.

""RUDDY""? D repeated and Y? But D,Y allowed? And U? ""RUDDY"": R,U,D,D,Y? Letter not eliminated: U,D,Y? R? A 5-letter word? 

But D repeated? 

But is U allowed? Yes.

But we have to check if valid? ""RUDDY"" is a word.

But R in position 1? Then U(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5)? 

But R is in position 1? We are testing if R is in position 1?

Also, letters used: R,U,D,Y? D repeated? Actually, D and D? Same letter.

But the word contains U and Y? Vowels? 

But note: R in position 1? 

We could use ""ROWER""? O out? Invalid.

""ROWDY""? O out? Invalid.

""READY""? E,A out? Invalid.

Hard to find R at 1? 

Let's try R at position 3? So ""_ _ R _ _""

For example: B I R T H? T out? Invalid.

C A R D S? Multiple eliminated? Invalid.

H A R K? K? But H,A,R,K? A out? Invalid.

F I R S T? S,T out? Invalid, S and T eliminated.

B U R K A? A out? Invalid.

Another: M I R T H? T,H? But T out? Invalid.

B I R S T? S,T out? Invalid.

W E R E S? E,S out? Invalid.

U R I N E? U,R,I,N,E? N,E out? Invalid.

This is difficult.

Position 5: R at the end? ""...R""

For example: ...R

Words: A Z U R E? A out? Invalid.

L I Q U R? Q and R? Valid? Liquor? But that's LIQUOR? O is eliminated? From sport O(x)? So O not, invalid.

Also, L,I,Q,U,R? Positions: L(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), R(5)? 

Q and U? But is Q allowed? It's not eliminated? 

Letters available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And R.

""LIQUOR"": but LIQUOR has an O? Wait, spelling: L-I-Q-U-O-R? O at position 5? Wait, no: positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:Q, 4:U, 5:O, R? But ""LIQUOR"" is 6 letters? Mistake.

""L I Q U O R"" is 6 letters.

""LIQUR""? Not a word.

"" F L O O R""? O out? Invalid.

"" G L A R E""? A,E out? Invalid.

"" S C A R E""? Multiple out? Invalid.

 R in position 5: ""B R I A R""? A out? Invalid.

"" F I B R E""? E out? Invalid.

P R I O R? O out? Invalid.

H U M O R? O out? Invalid.

But we need a vowel? U or I or Y.

Word: "" F L U R R""? Not common? Flurr? Not a word.

"" B L U R R""? Valid? Blurr? Or blur? Not 5 letters.

"" P L U R L""? Not a word.

"" D E M U R""? E out? Invalid.

Perhaps "" B U G L R""? Not a word.

Maybe we have to use Y? Like "" M U R K Y""? M,U,R,K,Y? Positions: M(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5)? 

Letters: M,U,R,K,Y? Also, U at position 2, R at position 3? R in position 3? Which is possible? 

And all letters allowed? Eliminated: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T? None of M,U,R,K,Y are eliminated? M allowed, U allowed, R allowed, K allowed, Y allowed? 

""MURKY"" is a valid word: meaning dark and dirty? 

Yes! Also, U is a vowel? And R at position 3? 

So that satisfies: R not in 2 or 4? Here it is in position 3? Could be correct? 

We test position 3 for R? And also test M,U,K,Y? 

Another possibility: ""LURID""? L,U,R,I,D? 
L(1), U(2), R(3), I(4), D(5)? R at position 3? 
Letters L,U,R,I,D? All not eliminated? 

""LURID"" is a word? Yes.

But which to choose? ""MURKY"" or ""LURID""? 

Both have R at position 3? 

""LURID"": also tests I and D? 

But we also need to cover vowel? Both have U? 

Since we have many unknowns, we need to test as many new letters as possible? 

In ""MURKY"", letters: M,U,R,K,Y -> M,U,K,Y new? R we know? In ""LURID"": L,U,R,I,D -> L,U,I,D new? 

In guess 2, we didn't use K or Y, so they are new? 

I think both are valid? 

We could choose ""MURKY"": to test K and Y? 

But I is a common vowel? ""LURID"" tests I? 

However, with E,A,O out, I and U are important vowels? 

So ""LURID"" tests I at position 4? 

Also, D? Which is common consonant? 

So ""LURID"" tests: L,U,D,R,I? R known? But positions: we test U at position 2? 

Another: in ""LURID"", U is at position 2? We don't know about position 2? 

Similarly, in ""MURKY"", U at position 2? 

So both words? 

I think ""MURKY"" uses K and Y which are less common? So ""LURID"" might be better? 

But let's also think: we need to avoid? 

Another word: "" BUILD""? B,U,I,L,D? But R not included? We must include R? Secret word has R? So our guess must include R? Because we know R is in? 

Important: we cannot omit R? Because it must be in the word? 

So any guess must contain R? 

Both ""LURID"" and ""MURKY"" contain R? 

""FJORD""? O? O is out? From sport O(x)? So invalid? 

""QUIRK""? Q,U,I,R,K? Positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), R(4), K(5)? But R in position 4? 

We know R is not in position 4? Because from guess 2, sport at position 4 R(-) so wrong position? So if we put R at position 4 again, it will again be '-'? 

So do not put R at position 4? We must avoid positions 2 and 4 for R? 

Therefore, ""QUIRK"" has R at position 4? So it would be marked '-'? But we know that? So it doesn't help? 

Similarly, we should avoid position 4 for R? 

In ""MURKY"": R at position 3? Clear? Avoids position 4? 
In ""LURID"": position 3? Good? 

What about R at position 1? Like ""RUDDY"" ? But it has D repeated? 

"" R U M B A""? A out? Invalid.

"" R H Y M E""? E out? Invalid.

"" R U I N S""? S out? Invalid.

So ""LURID"" and ""MURKY"" are best? 

I think I'll go with ""LURID"" because it uses more common letters: L, I, D? Compared to K and Y? 

Also, ""LURID"" has U and I, two vowels? 

So guess: ""LURID""? 

Confirmation: 
L: position 1? Not tested before? 
U: position 2? Test? 
R: position 3? 
I: position 4? 
D: position 5? 

Letters: L,U,R,I,D? All not eliminated? And R must be in word? 

Yes. 

Alternatively, ""GUILD""? But no R? Must include R? 

So ""LURID"" seems valid? 

Final decision: guess ""LURID"".<thinking>
Previous Feedback Summary:
- Guess 1 (""crane""): Eliminated C, A, N, E. R present but not in position 2.
- Guess 2 (""sport""): Eliminated S, P, O, T. R present but not in position 4.

Key Insights:
- Eliminated letters: A, C, E, N, O, P, S, T.
- R must be in the word, but cannot be in positions 2 or 4. Possible positions: 1, 3, or 5.
- Remaining available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Given vowel elimination (A, E, O out), likely vowels are I or U (or Y).
- Next guess must include R in position 1, 3, or 5 and avoid eliminated letters.

For this guess:
- Prioritize confirming R's position while testing new common letters (e.g., I, U, L, D).
- ""lurid"" selected because:
  - Valid 5-letter English word.
  - Places R in position 3 (avoiding positions 2/4).
  - Uses new letters: L, U, I, D (all untested and available).
  - Covers vowels I and U, key for word constraints.
  - Tests multiple positions, balancing between gathering new info and narrowing possibilities.

C,A,N,E out, so G,H,I,T are new.\nThis word is valid and has R in position 1 (which is allowed).\n\nBut wait, we have feedback that R is not in position 2, but position 1 is okay.\n\nAnother possibility: ""PROUD"" but P,R,O,U,D? But P is new? Yes, but note that positions: R would be in position 2? But the feedback says R is not in position 2? No: we must avoid R in position 2 because in the feedback R was in position 2 and marked wrong position, meaning in the secret word R is not in position 2. So in our next guess, we can put R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if there are multiple R\'s. In the feedback, we had only one R and it was marked as present but wrong position. So at least one R exists, but we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nSince we are only at the second guess, we can assume one R for simplicity until contradicted.\n\nLet me brainstorm some words without the forbidden letters (C,A,N,E) and with R not in position 2, and including other common letters.\n\nConsider ""SPRIG"": but it has P,R,I,G,S? Positions: R is in position 3? \nBut we must check forbidden letters: C,A,N,E none are in SPRIG? And we have R in position 3.\n\nSPRIG: S, P, R (position 3), I, G.\n\nBut let me see: common words. Another: ""THROW"" has T,H,R,O,W? R in position 3? and avoids A,E,C,N? Yes.\n\n""THROW"": T (1), H (2), R (3), O (4), W (5). And letters: T, H, R, O, W.\n\nBut note: the second position in our guess is H. We have no information about position 2 yet.\n\nWe could use a word that uses more vowels? Since A and E are out, we have I, O, U. Let me include one of them.\n\nAnother word: ""ROTIS"" (might not be common)? Let\'s think of common words.\n\nA good word: ""FLIRT""? F,L,I,R,T. R is in position 4.\n\n""FLIRT"": letters F,L,I,R,T. No forbidden letters. R is at position 4.\n\nBut maybe we can do better? We want to test several common letters.\n\nAnother: ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T. R at position 4? and no forbidden letters? This has O and S, P, T which are common.\n\nOf course, ""SPORT"" has R in position 4? Let me spell: S-P-O-R-T, so position 4 is R? Then yes.\n\nBut note: the feedback does not forbid position 4, so that\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that places R in position 1 to rule it out quickly.\n\nFor example: ""ROBOT""? But has B,O,T and R? But R is in position 1? Then O in position 2? But A and E are out, so O and I/U are the remaining vowels. However, the feedback doesn\'t forbid O in position 2.\n\nBut ""ROBOT"" has a repeated O? But that\'s acceptable? Also, we don\'t know if O is in the word or not.\n\nTo maximize new letters, we should avoid repeats.\n\nAlso, note that we are missing information about positions 1, 3, 4, 5 (since we only know R is not in position 2).\n\nSo, let me choose a word that:\n- Starts with R (position 1) to test that position, and because R must be somewhere.\n- Uses new common letters: T, O, L, S, etc.\n\nWord: ""ROTLS""? Not a word. ""ROWTS""? Not common.\n\nCommon word: ""RISKY"" has I, S, K, Y? And R at the start.\n\nBut R is position 1.\n\n""RISKY"": R (1), I (2), S (3), K (4), Y (5). This avoids A,E,C,N? Yes? Then good.\n\nBut what about position 2? We don\'t know about I. Also, we need to test a vowel? I is a vowel.\n\nAnother common word: ""DRIPS""? But D, R, I, P, S? But D is new? And R at position 2? Wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know R is not in position 2? Is that true?\n\nClarify: we have a rule: R is present but not in position 2. Therefore, if we put R in position 2 again, we know it will be marked wrong position (because it\'s not correct). But we can do that? The feedback will tell us again that R is in wrong position? It might be redundant.\n\nHowever, for our information, if we put R in position 2 again, and it gets marked as \'-\', that doesn\'t give us new information. We already know position 2 is wrong. So we should avoid position 2 for R to test other positions.\n\nTherefore, in the next guess, R should be in 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nWe can set it in position 1 to check if it\'s correct there.\n\nIf we guess R in position 1 and it becomes correct (✓), then we know R is first letter. If it\'s marked \'-\', then we know R is not in position 1 either.\n\nSo to test position 1: put R at start.\n\nWord: ""RUSTS""? But repeated? Avoid repeats if possible.\n\n""RUSTY"": R,U,S,T,Y. Avoids forbidden letters? Yes. R at position 1.\n\nBut U? We don\'t know.\n\n""ROWDY"": R,O,W,D,Y? Avoids forbidden? Yes. But D and Y?\n\n""ROGUE""? But E is forbidden -> doesn\'t work.\n\n""ROBOT"": has O repeated? And B,O,T? \n\nBut we might use a word without repeating letters.\n\n""RAPID""? But A is out -> invalid.\n\n""RINSE"" has N -> invalid because N is not in the word.\n\nWe don\'t have many options? \n\nAnother: ""RIFTS"" - R,I,F,T,S. All distinct and new? F is a bit less common? \n\nBut acceptable.\n\n""RISKY"" as above: R, I, S, K, Y.\n\nLet me choose ""RISKY"" because it uses common letters? Or ""ROBIN""? But N is forbidden -> not valid.\n\nWait, ""ROBIN"" has N -> we must avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""ROYAL""? But A -> invalid.\n\n""PRIZE""? But Z and E -> E is out -> invalid.\n\n""FLIRT"" as before: F,L,I,R,T - R in position 4? But we don\'t test position 1 then.\n\nTo maximize coverage of positions, we can try to set R in a new position and common letters.\n\nConsider ""THIRD"": T,H,I,R,D? R in position 4? T,H,I,R,D.\n\nThat uses T and H, and I and D.\n\nAlso ""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R,T -> R in position 4? and S,H,I,T.\n\nNow, that includes common consonants and a vowel I.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHIRT"" has letters S, H, I, R, T.\n\nWe want to test S, H, T which are common.\n\nSo, ""SHIRT"" might be a good candidate: \n- Includes R not in position 2 (here it\'s in position 4).\n- Avoids forbidden letters: C,A,N,E.\n- Uses new letters: S, H, I, T (and R again, but R we know is in).\n\nBut note: we need to see if these letters are likely.\n\nWe could use ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R,T -> O is a vowel we haven\'t tried? We haven\'t tried O or I. \n\nBut ""SHIRT"" has the vowel I.\n\nAnother: ""STORM""? But M? And O? Let me see.\n\nWait, we don\'t have O tested? We should test O because it\'s a common vowel.\n\nSo consider ""SPORT"": \n- S (new), P (new), O (vowel), R (known), T (new). \nBut R in position 4? So we are testing O and S, P, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""GROUP"" but G,R,O,U,P? But U is a vowel? R in position 2? Wait, position 2: we cannot put R in position 2? Because R was marked wrong there. So GROUP has R in position 2 -> we shouldn\'t do that? Because we know it will be incorrect.\n\nGROUP: G, R (2), O, U, P -> R at 2 is not allowed? The feedback would mark R as wrong position again? It doesn\'t break the rule, but it won\'t give us new information about R. So better to avoid.\n\nThen avoid position 2 for R.\n\nSo, let me choose between:\n- ""RISKY"": R at 1, I at 2, S,K,Y\n- ""THIRD"": T,H,I (at 3), R at 4, D\n- ""FLIRT"": F,L,I,R at 4, T\n- ""SHIRT"": S,H,I,R at 4, T\n- ""SPORT"": S,P,O,R at 4, T\n\nBut I like ""SHIRT"" because it covers S,H,I,T and R.\n\n""SPORT"" adds O which is another common vowel? But O is not tested? Since we tested A,E (both out), testing O would be good.\n\nSo ""SPORT"" is maybe better? \n\nLet me see commonality: both valid.\n\nBut note: the secret word might have O? Without testing, we don\'t know.\n\nIn ""SHIRT"", we test I (vowel) and common consonants S,H,T.\n\nWe know R is in the word, so we are also testing position for R? In ""SPORT"" R is at position 4? Same in ""SHIRT""? Both are at position 4? Then we get information: if R is at position 4 and marked ✓, then it\'s correct. If marked \'-\', then R is not at position 4? But we know R is in the word, so it can be elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, we can put R at position 3? \n\nFor example, ""TRIOS"": T,R at 2? No: T at 1, R at 2 -> cannot because R in position 2 is forbidden.\n\nHow about ""STRIP"": S,T,R? Positions: S(1), T(2), R(3), I(4), P(5)? That way R is at position 3? And avoids position 2.\n\n""STRIP"": S,T,R,I,P.\n\nThis uses S,T,R,I,P -> avoids forbidden? And R in position 3? \n\nSimilarly, ""STRAP"" has A -> invalid.\n\nSo ""STRIP"" is okay? And it tests position 3 for R? And letters S,T,I,P.\n\nI think ""STRIP"" is a good candidate: \n- Tests R at position 3 (new position).\n- Tests new common letters: S, T, I, P.\n\nNow, the feedback: \nIn our first guess ""crane"", we ruled out A, E, N, C? And R is in word but not position 2. \n\nSo we have 6 letters ruled out? But also, we know the word doesn\'t have A, E, N, C? So we have more freedom? Or less? \n\nLet me choose ""STRIP"".\n\nAlso, we have only 6 tries, so we need to be efficient.\n\nAnother word: ""PRISM"" - P,R,I,S,M? But M? And positions: P(1), R(2) -> position 2? Avoid because R cannot be position 2? So ""PRISM"" has R at position 2: discard.\n\nSo my candidates: ""STRIP"", ""SHIRT"", ""SPORT"", ""RISKY"".\n\nI think ""STRIP"" tests more letters? S, T, R, I, P? That\'s common.\n\nOr ""SPORT"" tests O? \n\nBut we haven\'t tested O? So testing O might be good? Because if O is in the word, we\'ll know.\n\nBut with ""STRIP"", we test I? That also a vowel? And I is more common than O? \n\nActually, in English, E is most common, then A, then O, then I? So O is more common than I? \n\nAccording to some sources, letter frequency: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, etc. But we know R is in, and E,A,N are out? So O and I are the next common vowels? Actually O is more common than I? So to test O might be better? \n\nLet me see: O has about 7.5%, I has 6.9%? Slightly more O. \n\nBut in any case, both important.\n\nBut with ""STRIP"", we get a chance to have R in a new position (3), and we test I (vowel) and S,T (common consonants).\n\nWith ""SPORT"", we test O (vowel) and S,P,T? And R at position 4? We don\'t get a new position for R? If we test position 3 or position 1 for R, that might be better? \n\nFor example, if I set R at position 1 and it is correct, we get a ✓. If not, we get \'-\', meaning R is not at 1, so we know it must be at 3,4, or 5? And the next guess we can avoid 1 and 2? \n\nSimilarly, for position 3: if we test it and it\'s correct, we know; if not, we eliminate that position? \n\nNow, testing position 3 might be as good as position 1? \n\nBut position 1 is the start, which is important? But also, R is common at the beginning? \n\nConsidering that, let me try ""RISKY"" which tests R at position 1? \n\nAlso, ""RISKY"" uses S,K,Y? Y is less common? So maybe not? \n\nAnother word: ""RHYME""? But H,Y,M,E? E is forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""ROUGH""? But G and H? And U? R at 1? \n\nBut U is a vowel? We haven\'t tested U? \n\nWe also have U? And Y? \n\nBut for second guess, let\'s avoid rare letters? S, T, O, I, L, etc. are better? \n\nI think ""STRIP"" is good? Or ""SHORT""? \n\n""SHORT"": S,H,O,R,T? That\'s S at 1, H at 2, O at 3, R at 4, T at 5? And it includes O? So we test O? And R at position 4? \n\nThat avoids forbidden? C,A,N,E not in this word? \n\nThen ""SHORT"" tests S, H, O, R, T? R at position 4? \n\nBut we are repeating R at position 4? In feedback? It may be marked - if position 4 is wrong? But we don\'t know? \n\nBut position 4 might be correct? So it\'s worth testing? \n\nSince we haven\'t tested position 4? \n\nBut in ""STRIP"", we test R at position 3? \n\nI think either is acceptable? \n\nBut to decide: let me choose ""SHORT"" because it tests O? \n\nTo avoid missing a common vowel? \n\nSo ""SHORT""?\n\nSimilarly, ""SPORT"" is also good? Without H? \n\nBoth? \n\nI think I\'ll go with ""STRIP"": it tests position 3 for R and covers S,T,R,I,P? I is a vowel? \n\nBut O is more common? \n\nHowever, we already have R, so we don\'t need to test R itself? But we need to find its position? \n\nPerhaps in terms of probability? \n\nBut given constraint, let me settle on ""SPORT"": \nwhy? It avoids the previously forbidden letters, includes R not in position 2 (here at 4), and tests two common consonants S,P,T and a vowel O? \n\nS and T are very common? So ""SPORT"" is good? \n\nThus, my second guess: ""SPORT"".\n\n<thinking>\nFrom the first guess ""crane"", feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x). This eliminates C, A, N, E and indicates R is present but not in the second position.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n- Must avoid C, A, N, E.\n- Should explore new common letters (e.g., T, O, L, S, P, I) and positions.\n\nCandidate words considered: \n- ""SHIRT"" (R at position 4; tests S, H, I, T).\n- ""STRIP"" (R at position 3; tests S, T, R, I, P).\n- ""SPORT"" (R at position 4; tests S, P, O, T).\n\nChose ""SPORT"" because:\n- It includes O, a common vowel not yet tested.\n- Uses common consonants S, P, T.\n- Avoids forbidden letters and places R appropriately.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>sport</guess><thinking>\nBased on the previous feedback:\n- Secret word does not contain: C, A, N, E\n- Contains R, but not in position 2\n- R must appear in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5\n\nFor next guess:\n- Must include R, avoiding position 2\n- Must omit C, A, N, E\n- Should test new common letters: S, T, O, P, etc. to gain information\n- Prioritize vowels (O) since A/E are eliminated\n\nChose ""SPORT"":\n- Positions: S(1), P(2), O(3), R(4), T(5) → R safely in position 4\n- Uses common letters S, P, O, T, testing O (vowel) and key consonants\n- Valid English word, no conflicts\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>sport</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: sport -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(x) O(x) R(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(x)\nMeaning: \n- C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.\n- R is in the word but not in position 2.\n\nGuess 2: sport -> S(x), P(x), O(x), R(-), T(x)\nMeaning:\n- S, P, O, T are not in the word at all.\n- R is in the word but not in position 4 (since in ""sport"", R is in position 4 and marked as \'-\', meaning wrong position).\n\nNow, combining the information:\n- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T\n- R must be in the word, and now we know it cannot be in position 2 (from first guess) or position 4 (from second guess). So possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 5.\n\nAlso, the secret word must be composed of letters not eliminated. The available letters are all except C, A, N, E, S, P, O, T.\n\nAlphabet: A to Z\nEliminated: A, C, E, N, O, P, T, S\nSo remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: R is already known to be in the word.\n\nWe must form a 5-letter word using the remaining letters, including R (which must be in position 1, 3, or 5), and avoiding the eliminated letters.\n\nAlso, the word must be valid English.\n\nPossible words? Since we have only a few positions to try.\n\nMoreover, we have only used two guesses, so we have 4 left? 6 total.\n\nWe need to test: position for R and also other letters.\n\nSince R must be in 1, 3, or 5, we can try to put R at position 1? Or perhaps use a word that tests multiple possibilities.\n\nWe should also test other common letters from the remaining set? Such as I, L, U, etc.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know what vowels are left? Available vowels: I, U, and sometimes Y? Since A, E, O are eliminated.\n\nSo the word must contain vowels? And I and U are the main options? Plus Y.\n\nSo we need a word with R in position 1, 3, or 5, and using only letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But without the eliminated ones.\n\nWe can break down:\n\nCommon remaining letters: R (must include), B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, U, Y\n\nWe should try to cover as many of these as possible in one guess? But priority: find where R is.\n\nIf we put R at position 1, we test position 1? If it\'s correct, we know. If not, it will be in 3 or 5? So we narrow.\n\nSimilarly, position 3? \n\nBut let me think of common words that start with R and use the allowed letters.\n\nPossible word: ""RULER""? But E and R repeated? E is eliminated -> invalid.\n\n""RIGID""? Has D? But positions: R at 1, I at 2? Then G,I,D? But D? Eliminated letters? E is out, but D is available? And also repeated I? \n\n""RIGID"": R at 1, I, G, I, D? Letters: R,I,G,D? I repeated? Also available, but we might avoid repeats? Not necessary, but the word is valid? However, we have other options.\n\nBut D is still available? And not tested? \n\nHowever, we want to maximize new letters? \n\nAnother: ""RAINY""? A is eliminated? Not valid.\n\n""RUDER""? Has E? Invalid.\n\n""FRUIT""? F and R: but position of R? F,R,U,I,T? But T is eliminated? From sport T(x), so T is out? Cannot use T? \n\nWe also have to avoid eliminated letters: T is out? Yes, from guess 2.\n\nSimilarly, in ""fruit"", T would be eliminated? But ""fruit"" has T at the end? T is eliminated? So ""fruit"" invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""LYRIC""? But L, Y, R, I, C? C is eliminated? Invalid.\n\n""BRINK""? B,R,I,N,K? N is eliminated? From crane N(x) -> invalid.\n\n""GRIMY""? G,R,I,M,Y? Letters: G,R,I,M,Y? All allowed? Because G,R,I,M,Y not eliminated? \n\nEliminated: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T? So G is allowed, R allowed, I allowed, M allowed, Y allowed? \n\nYes.\n\nPositions: G at 1, R at 2? But we know R cannot be in position 2? From first guess, R must not be position 2? But guess 2 doesn\'t change that? So if we put R in position 2, it will be wrong position? Because earlier it was position 2 and marked wrong.\n\nIn ""GRIMY"", R is at position 2? So that position is wrong? We cannot set R at 2? And it will not change? \n\nTherefore, avoid position 2 for R? \n\nSo ""GRIMY"": G(1), R(2) but position 2 is wrong? So R(2) will be marked \'-\' again? But we know that? So it doesn\'t help? \n\nBut if we change to put R at position 3? \n\nFor example, ""BIRCH""? But H? And C? C eliminated? Invalid.\n\nWord: ""URBAN""? But A eliminated? Invalid.\n\n""CURVE""? C eliminated? Invalid.\n\nWe need a word with R in 1, 3, or 5.\n\nFor example: \n- R in position 1: ""R...."" \n  No A,E,O,S,P,T? Available: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,R,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? But without eliminated.\n\nSo ""R...."" can be: R U L E R? But E eliminated? No.\n\n""RHYME""? But E eliminated? No.\n\n""RUMOR""? O eliminated? And repeated O? O is out? So invalid.\n\n""RIDER""? D,E,R? E out? Invalid.\n\n""RISER""? S,E? Out? Invalid.\n\n""RIVER""? E? Out? And R repeated? Not valid.\n\n""RIDER"" invalid.\n\n""RUBY"" only 4? Must 5 letters? ""RUBY"" is 4.\n\n""RUDDY""? D repeated and Y? But D,Y allowed? And U? ""RUDDY"": R,U,D,D,Y? Letter not eliminated: U,D,Y? R? A 5-letter word? \n\nBut D repeated? \n\nBut is U allowed? Yes.\n\nBut we have to check if valid? ""RUDDY"" is a word.\n\nBut R in position 1? Then U(2), D(3), D(4), Y(5)? \n\nBut R is in position 1? We are testing if R is in position 1?\n\nAlso, letters used: R,U,D,Y? D repeated? Actually, D and D? Same letter.\n\nBut the word contains U and Y? Vowels? \n\nBut note: R in position 1? \n\nWe could use ""ROWER""? O out? Invalid.\n\n""ROWDY""? O out? Invalid.\n\n""READY""? E,A out? Invalid.\n\nHard to find R at 1? \n\nLet\'s try R at position 3? So ""_ _ R _ _""\n\nFor example: B I R T H? T out? Invalid.\n\nC A R D S? Multiple eliminated? Invalid.\n\nH A R K? K? But H,A,R,K? A out? Invalid.\n\nF I R S T? S,T out? Invalid, S and T eliminated.\n\nB U R K A? A out? Invalid.\n\nAnother: M I R T H? T,H? But T out? Invalid.\n\nB I R S T? S,T out? Invalid.\n\nW E R E S? E,S out? Invalid.\n\nU R I N E? U,R,I,N,E? N,E out? Invalid.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nPosition 5: R at the end? ""...R""\n\nFor example: ...R\n\nWords: A Z U R E? A out? Invalid.\n\nL I Q U R? Q and R? Valid? Liquor? But that\'s LIQUOR? O is eliminated? From sport O(x)? So O not, invalid.\n\nAlso, L,I,Q,U,R? Positions: L(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), R(5)? \n\nQ and U? But is Q allowed? It\'s not eliminated? \n\nLetters available: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And R.\n\n""LIQUOR"": but LIQUOR has an O? Wait, spelling: L-I-Q-U-O-R? O at position 5? Wait, no: positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:Q, 4:U, 5:O, R? But ""LIQUOR"" is 6 letters? Mistake.\n\n""L I Q U O R"" is 6 letters.\n\n""LIQUR""? Not a word.\n\n"" F L O O R""? O out? Invalid.\n\n"" G L A R E""? A,E out? Invalid.\n\n"" S C A R E""? Multiple out? Invalid.\n\n R in position 5: ""B R I A R""? A out? Invalid.\n\n"" F I B R E""? E out? Invalid.\n\nP R I O R? O out? Invalid.\n\nH U M O R? O out? Invalid.\n\nBut we need a vowel? U or I or Y.\n\nWord: "" F L U R R""? Not common? Flurr? Not a word.\n\n"" B L U R R""? Valid? Blurr? Or blur? Not 5 letters.\n\n"" P L U R L""? Not a word.\n\n"" D E M U R""? E out? Invalid.\n\nPerhaps "" B U G L R""? Not a word.\n\nMaybe we have to use Y? Like "" M U R K Y""? M,U,R,K,Y? Positions: M(1), U(2), R(3), K(4), Y(5)? \n\nLetters: M,U,R,K,Y? Also, U at position 2, R at position 3? R in position 3? Which is possible? \n\nAnd all letters allowed? Eliminated: C,A,N,E,S,P,O,T? None of M,U,R,K,Y are eliminated? M allowed, U allowed, R allowed, K allowed, Y allowed? \n\n""MURKY"" is a valid word: meaning dark and dirty? \n\nYes! Also, U is a vowel? And R at position 3? \n\nSo that satisfies: R not in 2 or 4? Here it is in position 3? Could be correct? \n\nWe test position 3 for R? And also test M,U,K,Y? \n\nAnother possibility: ""LURID""? L,U,R,I,D? \nL(1), U(2), R(3), I(4), D(5)? R at position 3? \nLetters L,U,R,I,D? All not eliminated? \n\n""LURID"" is a word? Yes.\n\nBut which to choose? ""MURKY"" or ""LURID""? \n\nBoth have R at position 3? \n\n""LURID"": also tests I and D? \n\nBut we also need to cover vowel? Both have U? \n\nSince we have many unknowns, we need to test as many new letters as possible? \n\nIn ""MURKY"", letters: M,U,R,K,Y -> M,U,K,Y new? R we know? In ""LURID"": L,U,R,I,D -> L,U,I,D new? \n\nIn guess 2, we didn\'t use K or Y, so they are new? \n\nI think both are valid? \n\nWe could choose ""MURKY"": to test K and Y? \n\nBut I is a common vowel? ""LURID"" tests I? \n\nHowever, with E,A,O out, I and U are important vowels? \n\nSo ""LURID"" tests I at position 4? \n\nAlso, D? Which is common consonant? \n\nSo ""LURID"" tests: L,U,D,R,I? R known? But positions: we test U at position 2? \n\nAnother: in ""LURID"", U is at position 2? We don\'t know about position 2? \n\nSimilarly, in ""MURKY"", U at position 2? \n\nSo both words? \n\nI think ""MURKY"" uses K and Y which are less common? So ""LURID"" might be better? \n\nBut let\'s also think: we need to avoid? \n\nAnother word: "" BUILD""? B,U,I,L,D? But R not included? We must include R? Secret word has R? So our guess must include R? Because we know R is in? \n\nImportant: we cannot omit R? Because it must be in the word? \n\nSo any guess must contain R? \n\nBoth ""LURID"" and ""MURKY"" contain R? \n\n""FJORD""? O? O is out? From sport O(x)? So invalid? \n\n""QUIRK""? Q,U,I,R,K? Positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), R(4), K(5)? But R in position 4? \n\nWe know R is not in position 4? Because from guess 2, sport at position 4 R(-) so wrong position? So if we put R at position 4 again, it will again be \'-\'? \n\nSo do not put R at position 4? We must avoid positions 2 and 4 for R? \n\nTherefore, ""QUIRK"" has R at position 4? So it would be marked \'-\'? But we know that? So it doesn\'t help? \n\nSimilarly, we should avoid position 4 for R? \n\nIn ""MURKY"": R at position 3? Clear? Avoids position 4? \nIn ""LURID"": position 3? Good? \n\nWhat about R at position 1? Like ""RUDDY"" ? But it has D repeated? \n\n"" R U M B A""? A out? Invalid.\n\n"" R H Y M E""? E out? Invalid.\n\n"" R U I N S""? S out? Invalid.\n\nSo ""LURID"" and ""MURKY"" are best? \n\nI think I\'ll go with ""LURID"" because it uses more common letters: L, I, D? Compared to K and Y? \n\nAlso, ""LURID"" has U and I, two vowels? \n\nSo guess: ""LURID""? \n\nConfirmation: \nL: position 1? Not tested before? \nU: position 2? Test? \nR: position 3? \nI: position 4? \nD: position 5? \n\nLetters: L,U,R,I,D? All not eliminated? And R must be in word? \n\nYes. \n\nAlternatively, ""GUILD""? But no R? Must include R? \n\nSo ""LURID"" seems valid? \n\nFinal decision: guess ""LURID"".<thinking>\nPrevious Feedback Summary:\n- Guess 1 (""crane""): Eliminated C, A, N, E.

Now, we have feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- C(x) → C not in word
- R(-) → R in word but wrong position
- A(x) → A not in word
- N(x) → N not in word
- E(x) → E not in word

**Guess 2: sport**
- S(x) → S not in word
- P(x) → P not in word
- O(x) → O not in word
- R(-) → R in word but wrong position (not position 4)
- T(x) → T not in word

**Guess 3: lurid**
- L(x) → L not in word
- U(✓) → U in word and in correct position (position 2)
- R(-) → R in word but wrong position (not position 3)
- I(x) → I not in word
- D(x) → D not in word

**Summary of known information:**

1. **Eliminated letters:** A, C, E, N, O, P, S, T, I, D, L (from all three guesses).  
   - Eliminated: A, C, E, N, O, P, S, T, I, D, L  
   - Still possible: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   But U is in the word and in position 2.

2. **U is confirmed in position 2.** So the secret word has U as its second letter: _ U _ _ _

3. **R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from guess 1), not position 4 (guess 2), and not position 3 (guess 3).**  
   Possible positions for R: 1, or 5 (since positions 2,3,4 are invalid).  
   Currently tested positions:  
   - Position 2 (in ""crane""): not correct → not pos 2  
   - Position 4 (in ""sport""): not correct → not pos 4  
   - Position 3 (in ""lurid""): not correct → not pos 3  
   Therefore, R must be in position 1 or 5.

4. **The word must include R and U, and U is at position 2.**

**New constraints:**
- Position 1: Could be R or another letter.
- Position 2: U (fixed).
- Position 3: Unknown, but not R.
- Position 4: Unknown, but not R.
- Position 5: Could be R or another letter.

**Available letters:** B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
But U and R are already in the word, so other letters needed: at least three more distinct letters? Could have duplicates? Probably not duplicates since no indication yet.

**Goal:** Guess a word that fits: ? U ? ? ?  
Where:
- Position 2 is U.
- R must be at position 1 or 5.
- Avoid eliminated letters.

**Possible words:**
If R at position 1: Form R U ? ? ?  
If R at position 5: Form ? U ? ? R

Now, need to fill ? with available letters.

**List feasible options:**

First, **R at position 1**: ""R U _ _ _""  
Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (since U is used, but can repeat? But no, in Wordle rules, if a letter is in the word, we don't know about duplicates unless hinted. But here, we have R and U possibly once? Not confirmed duplicates. We should avoid repeats unless necessary?

Possible words:  
- RUBY? → But only 4 letters?  
- R U B I C? But C and I eliminated → invalid  
- R U F U S? S eliminated → invalid  
- R U M B A? A eliminated → invalid  
- R U G G Y? G repeated → but possible?  
  - R U G G Y? But positions: R at 1, U at 2, G at 3, G at 4, Y at 5? → ""rugby"" is a common term?  
  - But G is available? Yes.  
  - ""RUGBY"" is a valid word.  

Letters: R,U,G,G,Y? G repeated? But allowed? Also, S not eliminated? S was eliminated in guess 2: S(x) → S not in word. So no S.  

""RUGBY"": R,U,G,B,Y? Not ""RUGBS"", wait, ""RUGBY"" → R,U,G,B,Y → five letters? Positions: R(1),U(2),G(3),B(4),Y(5)?  
B and Y available.

What about duplicates? R is used at start? U at 2? G,B,Y new?  

But is R duplicated? We don't know? The word has R, but ""RUGBY"" has one R?  

Similarly, U not duplicated?  

So ""RUGBY"" is possible?  

Another word: R U M O R? O eliminated → invalid.  
R U F F ? → Not valid?  

Second option: **R at position 5**: ""_ U _ _ R""  
Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z  

Possible words:  
- B U M P R? P eliminated → invalid  
- G U M M R? Not valid?  
- J U M A R? A eliminated → invalid  
- H U M P R? P eliminated → invalid  
- B U R Y R? But U R Y R? Positions: B U _ Y R? Not ""bury"" but 5 letters?  
""BURY"" is four.  
- F U Z Z R? Not ideal.  
- K U D O S? S,O,D → eliminated → invalid.  
- M U M M Y? S eliminated? M U M M Y → letters M,U,M,M,Y? M repeated? And R not included? But we must include R? Important, the secret word has R, so if we guess a word without R, it would be wrong? So any guess must include R.  

Since R must be in position 1 or 5, if not 1, then 5.  

For ""_ U _ _ R"", common words:  
- ""SUGAR""? S eliminated → invalid.  
- ""JUDGE R""? Not five.  
- ""QUEER""? E,Q? E eliminated→invalid.  
- ""FUZER""? Not English.  
- ""MUTER""? T,E → eliminated.  
- ""BUTLER""? Two words? BUTLER? Letters: B,U,T,L,E,R? T,L,E eliminated?  
- ""BUYER""? Y,B,U,E,R? E eliminated.  
- ""GUYER""? Not a word.  

Perhaps: ""H U M O R""? O eliminated.  
""G U V Y R?"" Not word.  
""B U G R R?"" Not word.  

""V U L G R?"" L eliminated→L(x) from lurid? L not in word.  

Another: ""J U N K R""? J,U,N,K,R? N eliminated →invalid.  

Hard to find.  

Perhaps with Y: ""L U C K Y""? L,C eliminated→invalid.  
""F U N G I""? N,G,I → N,I eliminated→I(x) from lurid?  

I think ""_ U _ _ R"" words are rare?  

Back to ""RUGBY"":  
""RUGBY"" is a valid English word meaning the sport.  
Letters: R,U,G,B,Y  
Positions: R at 1, U at 2 (confirmed), G at 3, B at 4, Y at 5.  
All letters available?  
- R: known to be in word? But position: if we guess R at 1, it could be correct?  
- U at 2: correct.  
- G, B, Y: not tested? Could be in word? Or not?  

Moreover, R position: if R is at position 1, we haven't tested that position before?  

Similarly, we could test ""JUMPS"" but S,P eliminated.  
""RUMBA"" but A eliminated.  

Another possibility: at position 5?  
But only found ""RUGBY""? Suitable.  

Other words: ""RUBIN"" → N eliminated? Invalid.  
""RUDER"" → E eliminated? Invalid.  

So ""RUGBY"" seems a good guess.  

But in ""RUGBY"", position 3 G, position 4 B? We have no info?  

Also, does the word contain G,B,Y? We'll see from feedback.  

Another candidate: ""RUVAY""? Not a word.  
""RUNGY""? Not word.  

I think ""RUGBY"" is acceptable?  

But let's confirm position of R: in ""RUGBY"", R at position 1? If incorrect, it would be flagged as ""-"" since R is not in position 1? And we know R must be in position 5?  

In guess 3, ""lurid"" had U in position 2 correct?  

So if we guess ""RUGBY"":  
- If R at position 1 is correct, good?  
- If not, marked as ""-"", meaning R should be at position 5?  

Then we can adjust next guess?  

But we have limited guesses? Still 3 left?  

Another word: ""HUMOR"" → O eliminated? Not possible.  

""FUMER"" → E? Eliminated.  

So proceed with ""RUGBY""?  

But in ""RUGBY"", all letters?  
Confirmed: not eliminated letters? Yes.  

Therefore, guess ""RUGBY"".  

Thinking:  
- With U fixed at position 2.  
- R could be at 1 or 5?  
- ""RUGBY"" tests R at position 1?  
- If R is actually at position 5? Then feedback for R will be ""-"" as wrong position?  
- But then we'd know R must be at position 5.  

Also, tests G,B,Y? Which are new letters?  

Good exploration.  

So final decision: guess ""RUGBY"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

1. **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Eliminates C, A, N, E; confirms R is in the secret word but not in position 2.
2. **Guess 2 (""sport"")**: Eliminates S, P, O, T; confirms R is not in position 4.
3. **Guess 3 (""lurid"")**:
   - L(x) → L is eliminated (not in word).
   - U(✓) → U is in the word and **correctly placed at position 2**.  
   - R(-) → R is in the word but **not in position 3**.
   - I(x) → I is eliminated (not in word).
   - D(x) → D is eliminated (not in word).

### Key Insights
- **Confirmed position**: U must be in **position 2** of the secret word → Secret word format: `_ U _ _ _`.
- **R constraints**: R is in the word but cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (per all feedback). → R must be in **position 1 or 5**.
- **Eliminated letters**: A, C, D, E, I, L, N, O, P, S, T (11 letters).  
- **Available letters**: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (U and R are already confirmed in the word).
- **Strategy for next guess**:
  - Must include **R in position 1 or 5** (to test its location).
  - Must retain **U in position 2**.
  - Fill remaining positions (3, 4, and possibly 1/5) with **new, high-frequency available letters** (e.g., B, G, H, K, M, Y) to maximize information.
  - Prioritize words that test R's position while exploring other common consonants/vowels.

### Derived Word Constraints
- Secret word pattern: `[R or ?] U [not R] [not R] [R or ?]`.
  - If R in position 1: `R U _ _ _`
  - If R in position 5: `_ U _ _ R`
- Possible words with U in position 2 and R in 1/5: 
  - `R U ? ? ?` → e.g., ""RUGBY"", ""RUMBA"" (invalid due to A), ""RUFUS"" (invalid due to S).
  - `? U ? ? R` → e.g., ""MUCKR"" (invalid), ""BUGGR"" (invalid).

### Selected Guess: ""RUGBY""
- **Why ""RUGBY""?**
  - Fits constraints: `R U _ _ _` (R in position 1 tests its location), U in position 2 confirmed.
  - Uses new available letters: G, B, Y (untested and common).
  - Avoids eliminated letters.
  - Valid English word.
- **Expected outcomes**:
  - If R is in position 1: Feedback will show ✓ for R if correct, or (-) if R is not in position 1 (implying R must be in position 5).
  - Feedback for G, B, Y will reveal their presence/absence/position.
- **Alternatives considered**:  
  - No strong alternatives (e.g., ""RUMBA"" invalid due to A; ""BUYER"" invalid due to E).
  - ""RUGBY"" maximizes info on R's position and new letters efficiently.

### Next Steps
- This guess will confirm R's position (1 or 5) and test G, B, Y for inclusion.

<thinking>
Consolidated feedback confirms U is fixed at position 2 and R must be in position 1 or 5. ""RUGBY"" strategically tests R at position 1 while introducing new high-priority letters (B, G, Y) within allowed constraints. If R is not in position 1, it must be in position 5, narrowing the solution space rapidly.

<guess>rugby</guess>",rugby,"Now, we have feedback from three guesses:

**Guess 1: crane**
- C(x) → C not in word
- R(-) → R in word but wrong position
- A(x) → A not in word
- N(x) → N not in word
- E(x) → E not in word

**Guess 2: sport**
- S(x) → S not in word
- P(x) → P not in word
- O(x) → O not in word
- R(-) → R in word but wrong position (not position 4)
- T(x) → T not in word

**Guess 3: lurid**
- L(x) → L not in word
- U(✓) → U in word and in correct position (position 2)
- R(-) → R in word but wrong position (not position 3)
- I(x) → I not in word
- D(x) → D not in word

**Summary of known information:**

1. **Eliminated letters:** A, C, E, N, O, P, S, T, I, D, L (from all three guesses).  
   - Eliminated: A, C, E, N, O, P, S, T, I, D, L  
   - Still possible: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
   But U is in the word and in position 2.

2. **U is confirmed in position 2.** So the secret word has U as its second letter: _ U _ _ _

3. **R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from guess 1), not position 4 (guess 2), and not position 3 (guess 3).**  
   Possible positions for R: 1, or 5 (since positions 2,3,4 are invalid).  
   Currently tested positions:  
   - Position 2 (in ""crane""): not correct → not pos 2  
   - Position 4 (in ""sport""): not correct → not pos 4  
   - Position 3 (in ""lurid""): not correct → not pos 3  
   Therefore, R must be in position 1 or 5.

4. **The word must include R and U, and U is at position 2.**

**New constraints:**
- Position 1: Could be R or another letter.
- Position 2: U (fixed).
- Position 3: Unknown, but not R.
- Position 4: Unknown, but not R.
- Position 5: Could be R or another letter.

**Available letters:** B, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Y, Z  
But U and R are already in the word, so other letters needed: at least three more distinct letters? Could have duplicates? Probably not duplicates since no indication yet.

**Goal:** Guess a word that fits: ? U ? ? ?  
Where:
- Position 2 is U.
- R must be at position 1 or 5.
- Avoid eliminated letters.

**Possible words:**
If R at position 1: Form R U ? ? ?  
If R at position 5: Form ? U ? ? R

Now, need to fill ? with available letters.

**List feasible options:**

First, **R at position 1**: ""R U _ _ _""  
Available: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z (since U is used, but can repeat? But no, in Wordle rules, if a letter is in the word, we don't know about duplicates unless hinted. But here, we have R and U possibly once? Not confirmed duplicates. We should avoid repeats unless necessary?

Possible words:  
- RUBY? → But only 4 letters?  
- R U B I C? But C and I eliminated → invalid  
- R U F U S? S eliminated → invalid  
- R U M B A? A eliminated → invalid  
- R U G G Y? G repeated → but possible?  
  - R U G G Y? But positions: R at 1, U at 2, G at 3, G at 4, Y at 5? → ""rugby"" is a common term?  
  - But G is available? Yes.  
  - ""RUGBY"" is a valid word.  

Letters: R,U,G,G,Y? G repeated? But allowed? Also, S not eliminated? S was eliminated in guess 2: S(x) → S not in word. So no S.  

""RUGBY"": R,U,G,B,Y? Not ""RUGBS"", wait, ""RUGBY"" → R,U,G,B,Y → five letters? Positions: R(1),U(2),G(3),B(4),Y(5)?  
B and Y available.

What about duplicates? R is used at start? U at 2? G,B,Y new?  

But is R duplicated? We don't know? The word has R, but ""RUGBY"" has one R?  

Similarly, U not duplicated?  

So ""RUGBY"" is possible?  

Another word: R U M O R? O eliminated → invalid.  
R U F F ? → Not valid?  

Second option: **R at position 5**: ""_ U _ _ R""  
Available letters: B,F,G,H,J,K,M,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z  

Possible words:  
- B U M P R? P eliminated → invalid  
- G U M M R? Not valid?  
- J U M A R? A eliminated → invalid  
- H U M P R? P eliminated → invalid  
- B U R Y R? But U R Y R? Positions: B U _ Y R? Not ""bury"" but 5 letters?  
""BURY"" is four.  
- F U Z Z R? Not ideal.  
- K U D O S? S,O,D → eliminated → invalid.  
- M U M M Y? S eliminated? M U M M Y → letters M,U,M,M,Y? M repeated? And R not included? But we must include R? Important, the secret word has R, so if we guess a word without R, it would be wrong? So any guess must include R.  

Since R must be in position 1 or 5, if not 1, then 5.  

For ""_ U _ _ R"", common words:  
- ""SUGAR""? S eliminated → invalid.  
- ""JUDGE R""? Not five.  
- ""QUEER""? E,Q? E eliminated→invalid.  
- ""FUZER""? Not English.  
- ""MUTER""? T,E → eliminated.  
- ""BUTLER""? Two words? BUTLER? Letters: B,U,T,L,E,R? T,L,E eliminated?  
- ""BUYER""? Y,B,U,E,R? E eliminated.  
- ""GUYER""? Not a word.  

Perhaps: ""H U M O R""? O eliminated.  
""G U V Y R?"" Not word.  
""B U G R R?"" Not word.  

""V U L G R?"" L eliminated→L(x) from lurid? L not in word.  

Another: ""J U N K R""? J,U,N,K,R? N eliminated →invalid.  

Hard to find.  

Perhaps with Y: ""L U C K Y""? L,C eliminated→invalid.  
""F U N G I""? N,G,I → N,I eliminated→I(x) from lurid?  

I think ""_ U _ _ R"" words are rare?  

Back to ""RUGBY"":  
""RUGBY"" is a valid English word meaning the sport.  
Letters: R,U,G,B,Y  
Positions: R at 1, U at 2 (confirmed), G at 3, B at 4, Y at 5.  
All letters available?  
- R: known to be in word? But position: if we guess R at 1, it could be correct?  
- U at 2: correct.  
- G, B, Y: not tested? Could be in word? Or not?  

Moreover, R position: if R is at position 1, we haven't tested that position before?  

Similarly, we could test ""JUMPS"" but S,P eliminated.  
""RUMBA"" but A eliminated.  

Another possibility: at position 5?  
But only found ""RUGBY""? Suitable.  

Other words: ""RUBIN"" → N eliminated? Invalid.  
""RUDER"" → E eliminated? Invalid.  

So ""RUGBY"" seems a good guess.  

But in ""RUGBY"", position 3 G, position 4 B? We have no info?  

Also, does the word contain G,B,Y? We'll see from feedback.  

Another candidate: ""RUVAY""? Not a word.  
""RUNGY""? Not word.  

I think ""RUGBY"" is acceptable?  

But let's confirm position of R: in ""RUGBY"", R at position 1? If incorrect, it would be flagged as ""-"" since R is not in position 1? And we know R must be in position 5?  

In guess 3, ""lurid"" had U in position 2 correct?  

So if we guess ""RUGBY"":  
- If R at position 1 is correct, good?  
- If not, marked as ""-"", meaning R should be at position 5?  

Then we can adjust next guess?  

But we have limited guesses? Still 3 left?  

Another word: ""HUMOR"" → O eliminated? Not possible.  

""FUMER"" → E? Eliminated.  

So proceed with ""RUGBY""?  

But in ""RUGBY"", all letters?  
Confirmed: not eliminated letters? Yes.  

Therefore, guess ""RUGBY"".  

Thinking:  
- With U fixed at position 2.  
- R could be at 1 or 5?  
- ""RUGBY"" tests R at position 1?  
- If R is actually at position 5? Then feedback for R will be ""-"" as wrong position?  
- But then we'd know R must be at position 5.  

Also, tests G,B,Y? Which are new letters?  

Good exploration.
