We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that can provide maximum information.
 Common initial words in Wordle include words that have a mix of common vowels and consonants.
 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters like R, A, I, S, E, T.

 One such word is ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E which are common letters and are vowels and common consonants.

 But note: the feedback will tell us about the presence and position of each letter.

 So for the first guess, I'll use: RAISE

 However, another popular starting word is ""CRANE"", but since I don't have a strong preference, I'll go with ""SOARE"" (which is a valid word meaning a young hawk) but let me stick to a more common one.

 Alternatively, ""ARISE"" is also common. Actually, ""RAISE"" and ""ARISE"" are very similar.

 I think ""SLATE"" is also a good one because it has S, L, A, T, E.

 Considering maximizing the number of common letters and distinct letters, I choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 But note: we must ensure the word is in the dictionary.

 Since any word is acceptable for the first guess, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 However, let me consider: we might also want to cover vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N).

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning the cumulative amount of money distributed by a business) and has very common letters? But I'll stick to a common one.

 After reviewing, I see that ""RAISE"" is a very common starting word. Let me pick ""RAISE"".

 Step-by-step reasoning:
 1. We need to maximize the information we get from the first guess.
 2. Choosing a word with distinct letters and common letters (vowels and consonants) is important.
 3. ""RAISE"" contains the vowels A, I, E and consonants R, S.
 4. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E — covering common letters.

 But note: the problem doesn't specify the dictionary. However, we can assume that common five-letter words are acceptable.

 Let's go with ""RAISE"".

 If we are not constrained by the actual Wordle dictionary, we'll hope ""RAISE"" is in the dictionary.

 Therefore, our first guess is: RAISE

We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  I: - (in the word but wrong position)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letters R, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter A is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letter I is in the word but not in the third position.

Also, note that the secret word must contain the letters A and I, but not R, S, E.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the second guess.

Our goal is to make a new guess that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.
2. Contains the letters A and I (since we know they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""RAISE"". Specifically, A cannot be in position 2 and I cannot be in position 3.
3. Avoids the letters R, S, E (since they are not in the word).

Additionally, we want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like T, O, N, L, C, etc.) and avoid repeating the absent letters.

Let's list the constraints for the next guess:
- Must include A and I, but A not in position 2 and I not in position 3.
- Must not include R, S, E.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so there are 3 more letters to discover.

We can consider the positions:
Position 1: cannot be R (since R is absent) and we don't know what it is. But note, we have A and I to place, and they can be in other positions.

We should try to place A and I in positions that are not their original positions in ""RAISE"". Also, we can try to cover other common letters.

Let's think of words that have A and I, and avoid R, S, E.

Common letters we haven't used: T, O, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A, I, and three new letters.

But note: we have two known letters (A and I) and three unknown. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible positions for A: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in our first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, I is in the word but not in position 3.

So for the next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 1, 3, 4, 5) and I in a different position (like 1, 2, 4, 5). But note: we don't want to put I in position 3 because we already know it's not there, and similarly for A in position 2.

But we can try to put A in position 1 and I in position 4, for example.

Let's try to think of words that have A and I, and avoid R, S, E.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> but let's check the positions: A is in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2 because we know it's not in the correct position? Actually, we can put A in position 2 again? But wait, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put A in position 2 again, we know it will be marked as wrong position again. But we want to try a new position to see if it is the correct one.

However, we are allowed to put A in position 2 again? But that would be inefficient because we already know it's not position 2. So we should try a different position for A to see if it is the correct one.

Similarly for I.

So we should avoid putting A in position 2 and I in position 3 in the next guess.

Therefore, in the next guess, we should put A in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 and I in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Now, let's think of words that fit.

Also, we want to include new common letters.

Let me try to list some words:

Option 1: A in position 1, I in position 4.
Example: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. But does it avoid R,S,E? Yes. But note: we have U, D, O as new letters.

Option 2: A in position 1, I in position 5: e.g., ""ALIBI"" -> A, L, I, B, I. But wait, it has two I's? The word ""ALIBI"" has two I's. But we don't know if the secret word has two I's? The feedback from the first guess only told us that I is present (at least one I). So it could have two I's? But we have to be cautious.

But note: in the first guess, we had one I and it was marked as present. So if the word has two I's, then we might get more information. However, we don't know.

But ""ALIBI"" has I at the end and in the middle? Actually, ""ALIBI"" is A-L-I-B-I, so positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), B(4), I(5). But we cannot put I in position 3 because we know I is not in position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, I is not in position 3. But if we put I in position 3 in our guess, it will be marked as absent? Or wrong? Let me clarify the rules.

The feedback is based on the secret word. If the secret word has only one I and we put two I's, then one of them might be marked as absent. Also, if we put I in position 3 and the secret word has I but not in that position, it will be marked as wrong position? But we already know that position 3 is wrong for I, so it would be redundant.

So to avoid confusion, it's better to use a word with distinct letters if possible.

Therefore, ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate: distinct letters and covers A, U, D, I, O.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""ADMIN"" -> A, D, M, I, N. But I is in position 5? Actually: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). So I is in position 4. This is also good.

But we have to avoid putting A in position 2? In ""ADMIN"", A is in position 1, which is allowed.

Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. Here, A is in position 3 and I in position 4. But note: we have A in position 3? We don't know if that is allowed? We are allowed to try A in position 3. Similarly, I in position 4.

But in ""PLAIT"", the positions are: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), T(5). So A is in 3 and I in 4.

We can also consider ""TAXIS"" but it has S which is absent? We cannot use S because we know S is not in the word. So avoid S.

Similarly, avoid R and E.

So ""PLAIT"" is acceptable? But wait, we don't know if the word has P, L, T. We are testing them.

But note: we are on the second guess, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me compare:

- ""AUDIO"": tests A (position 1), U, D, I (position 4), O.
- ""ADMIN"": tests A (1), D, M, I (4), N.
- ""PLAIT"": tests P, L, A (3), I (4), T.

All are valid.

But we also want to consider the frequency of letters. Common letters like T, N, L, O are good to test.

In ""AUDIO"", we test U and D which are less common. In ""ADMIN"", we test M which is less common than T or L. In ""PLAIT"", we test P, L, T. L and T are very common.

So ""PLAIT"" might be better because it tests common letters.

But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters. ""PLAIT"" does not contain R, S, E.

Another word: ""PLAIN"" -> but that has N, which is common. But I is in position 4? Actually, ""PLAIN"" is P-L-A-I-N, so I is in position 4? Wait, positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N. But we are putting A in position 3 and I in position 4. This is acceptable.

But ""PLAIN"" has A in position 3 and I in position 4, same as ""PLAIT"". But ""PLAIN"" uses N instead of T.

We can also consider ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O. Positions: A in position 2? But we cannot put A in position 2? Because we know A is not in position 2. So if we put A in position 2, we know it will be marked as wrong again. So we should avoid that.

Therefore, ""PATIO"" is not good because it puts A in position 2.

Similarly, ""RADII"" has R and is not allowed.

So let's stick to words that put A in a new position.

Another word: ""MANIA"" -> but it has two A's? And I. But we don't know about duplicates. Also, A is in position 2? Not allowed.

So avoid.

What about ""HAVOC""? But it doesn't have I.

We must include both A and I.

Another word: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y. Positions: A in position 2? Not allowed.

""OASIS"" has S and is not allowed.

""TRAIN"" has R and is not allowed.

So let's go back to ""PLAIT"" or ""AUDIO"" or ""ADMIN"".

I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice because it uses common consonants and places A and I in new positions.

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters? But ""PLAIT"" has distinct letters.

Another word: ""ALIGN"" -> A, L, I, G, N. But I is in position 3? We cannot put I in position 3 because we know it's not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we expect it to be marked as wrong position (if the secret word has I) but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information. Therefore, we should avoid putting I in position 3.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 2.

In ""ALIGN"": A(1), L(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). So I is in position 3, which we want to avoid.

Therefore, we should not use ""ALIGN"".

Similarly, ""CHAIN"" has A in position 3? C(1), H(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). So A in 3 and I in 4. This is acceptable. And it avoids R,S,E.

But we have C, H, N as new letters. H is less common.

I think ""PLAIT"" is better because it has P, L, T which are common.

But let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words. Common letters: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc. But we already know A and I are present, and R, S, E are absent. So we should test T, O, L, N, C, etc.

In ""PLAIT"", we test P, L, T. P is less common than O or N.

Another word: ""TOPAZ"" -> but doesn't have I.

We need a word with A and I.

What about ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T. Positions: A(2) -> not allowed! We cannot put A in position 2.

So ""PAINT"" is invalid for our purpose because it puts A in position 2.

But if we consider ""PAINT"", the A is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we would get a '-' for A again, which we already know. So it's a waste.

Therefore, we avoid.

Another word: ""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L. Positions: A(3), I(4). This is acceptable. But Q and U are less common, and we use two letters for one sound? But it's a valid word.

But we might get less information because Q is rare.

So I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that includes O or T more centrally.

What about ""FLAIR""? But it has R which is absent. Not allowed.

""CHAIN"" we considered.

""THAIL"" is not a word.

""ABOUT"" doesn't have I.

So I think ""PLAIT"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the dictionary. Assuming it is.

Alternatively, ""ADMIN"" is also good because it has N and M, which are common.

But I think testing T is more important than M.

Another word: ""PLANT"" -> but it doesn't have I.

We must have I.

So I'll go with ""PLAIT"".

But wait, in ""PLAIT"", we are putting A in position 3 and I in position 4. We don't know if these positions are correct, but we are testing them.

We could also consider ""OCTAL"" but no I.

After some thought, I think ""PLAIT"" is a good second guess.

Therefore, our next guess is ""PLAIT"".

But let me confirm the spelling: PLAIT is a word meaning a braid of hair or a fold.

Yes.

So we'll guess ""PLAIT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked as ""-"").
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and I, but avoid R, S, E.
- A cannot be placed in position 2, and I cannot be placed in position 3 to maximize new information.
- To test common unused letters (like P, L, T), ""PLAIT"" is chosen:
  - A is placed in position 3 (a new position to test).
  - I is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).
  - P, L, and T are introduced as new letters to gather more feedback.

This guess helps narrow down the positions of A and I while testing three new common consonants.

<guess>PLAIT</guess>",PLAIT,"We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  I: - (in the word but wrong position)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letters R, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter A is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letter I is in the word but not in the third position.

Also, note that the secret word must contain the letters A and I, but not R, S, E.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the second guess.

Our goal is to make a new guess that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.
2. Contains the letters A and I (since we know they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""RAISE"". Specifically, A cannot be in position 2 and I cannot be in position 3.
3. Avoids the letters R, S, E (since they are not in the word).

Additionally, we want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like T, O, N, L, C, etc.) and avoid repeating the absent letters.

Let's list the constraints for the next guess:
- Must include A and I, but A not in position 2 and I not in position 3.
- Must not include R, S, E.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so there are 3 more letters to discover.

We can consider the positions:
Position 1: cannot be R (since R is absent) and we don't know what it is. But note, we have A and I to place, and they can be in other positions.

We should try to place A and I in positions that are not their original positions in ""RAISE"". Also, we can try to cover other common letters.

Let's think of words that have A and I, and avoid R, S, E.

Common letters we haven't used: T, O, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A, I, and three new letters.

But note: we have two known letters (A and I) and three unknown. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible positions for A: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in our first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, I is in the word but not in position 3.

So for the next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 1, 3, 4, 5) and I in a different position (like 1, 2, 4, 5). But note: we don't want to put I in position 3 because we already know it's not there, and similarly for A in position 2.

But we can try to put A in position 1 and I in position 4, for example.

Let's try to think of words that have A and I, and avoid R, S, E.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> but let's check the positions: A is in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2 because we know it's not in the correct position? Actually, we can put A in position 2 again? But wait, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put A in position 2 again, we know it will be marked as wrong position again. But we want to try a new position to see if it is the correct one.

However, we are allowed to put A in position 2 again? But that would be inefficient because we already know it's not position 2. So we should try a different position for A to see if it is the correct one.

Similarly for I.

So we should avoid putting A in position 2 and I in position 3 in the next guess.

Therefore, in the next guess, we should put A in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 and I in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Now, let's think of words that fit.

Also, we want to include new common letters.

Let me try to list some words:

Option 1: A in position 1, I in position 4.
Example: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. But does it avoid R,S,E? Yes. But note: we have U, D, O as new letters.

Option 2: A in position 1, I in position 5: e.g., ""ALIBI"" -> A, L, I, B, I. But wait, it has two I's? The word ""ALIBI"" has two I's. But we don't know if the secret word has two I's? The feedback from the first guess only told us that I is present (at least one I). So it could have two I's? But we have to be cautious.

But note: in the first guess, we had one I and it was marked as present. So if the word has two I's, then we might get more information. However, we don't know.

But ""ALIBI"" has I at the end and in the middle? Actually, ""ALIBI"" is A-L-I-B-I, so positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), B(4), I(5). But we cannot put I in position 3 because we know I is not in position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, I is not in position 3. But if we put I in position 3 in our guess, it will be marked as absent? Or wrong? Let me clarify the rules.

The feedback is based on the secret word. If the secret word has only one I and we put two I's, then one of them might be marked as absent. Also, if we put I in position 3 and the secret word has I but not in that position, it will be marked as wrong position? But we already know that position 3 is wrong for I, so it would be redundant.

So to avoid confusion, it's better to use a word with distinct letters if possible.

Therefore, ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate: distinct letters and covers A, U, D, I, O.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""ADMIN"" -> A, D, M, I, N. But I is in position 5? Actually: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). So I is in position 4. This is also good.

But we have to avoid putting A in position 2? In ""ADMIN"", A is in position 1, which is allowed.

Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. Here, A is in position 3 and I in position 4. But note: we have A in position 3? We don't know if that is allowed? We are allowed to try A in position 3. Similarly, I in position 4.

But in ""PLAIT"", the positions are: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), T(5). So A is in 3 and I in 4.

We can also consider ""TAXIS"" but it has S which is absent? We cannot use S because we know S is not in the word. So avoid S.

Similarly, avoid R and E.

So ""PLAIT"" is acceptable? But wait, we don't know if the word has P, L, T. We are testing them.

But note: we are on the second guess, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me compare:

- ""AUDIO"": tests A (position 1), U, D, I (position 4), O.
- ""ADMIN"": tests A (1), D, M, I (4), N.
- ""PLAIT"": tests P, L, A (3), I (4), T.

All are valid.

But we also want to consider the frequency of letters. Common letters like T, N, L, O are good to test.

In ""AUDIO"", we test U and D which are less common. In ""ADMIN"", we test M which is less common than T or L. In ""PLAIT"", we test P, L, T. L and T are very common.

So ""PLAIT"" might be better because it tests common letters.

But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters. ""PLAIT"" does not contain R, S, E.

Another word: ""PLAIN"" -> but that has N, which is common. But I is in position 4? Actually, ""PLAIN"" is P-L-A-I-N, so I is in position 4? Wait, positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N. But we are putting A in position 3 and I in position 4. This is acceptable.

But ""PLAIN"" has A in position 3 and I in position 4, same as ""PLAIT"". But ""PLAIN"" uses N instead of T.

We can also consider ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O. Positions: A in position 2? But we cannot put A in position 2? Because we know A is not in position 2. So if we put A in position 2, we know it will be marked as wrong again. So we should avoid that.

Therefore, ""PATIO"" is not good because it puts A in position 2.

Similarly, ""RADII"" has R and is not allowed.

So let's stick to words that put A in a new position.

Another word: ""MANIA"" -> but it has two A's? And I. But we don't know about duplicates. Also, A is in position 2? Not allowed.

So avoid.

What about ""HAVOC""? But it doesn't have I.

We must include both A and I.

Another word: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y. Positions: A in position 2? Not allowed.

""OASIS"" has S and is not allowed.

""TRAIN"" has R and is not allowed.

So let's go back to ""PLAIT"" or ""AUDIO"" or ""ADMIN"".

I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice because it uses common consonants and places A and I in new positions.

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters? But ""PLAIT"" has distinct letters.

Another word: ""ALIGN"" -> A, L, I, G, N. But I is in position 3? We cannot put I in position 3 because we know it's not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we expect it to be marked as wrong position (if the secret word has I) but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information. Therefore, we should avoid putting I in position 3.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 2.

In ""ALIGN"": A(1), L(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). So I is in position 3, which we want to avoid.

Therefore, we should not use ""ALIGN"".

Similarly, ""CHAIN"" has A in position 3? C(1), H(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). So A in 3 and I in 4. This is acceptable. And it avoids R,S,E.

But we have C, H, N as new letters. H is less common.

I think ""PLAIT"" is better because it has P, L, T which are common.

But let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words. Common letters: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc. But we already know A and I are present, and R, S, E are absent. So we should test T, O, L, N, C, etc.

In ""PLAIT"", we test P, L, T. P is less common than O or N.

Another word: ""TOPAZ"" -> but doesn't have I.

We need a word with A and I.

What about ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T. Positions: A(2) -> not allowed! We cannot put A in position 2.

So ""PAINT"" is invalid for our purpose because it puts A in position 2.

But if we consider ""PAINT"", the A is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we would get a '-' for A again, which we already know. So it's a waste.

Therefore, we avoid.

Another word: ""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L. Positions: A(3), I(4). This is acceptable. But Q and U are less common, and we use two letters for one sound? But it's a valid word.

But we might get less information because Q is rare.

So I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that includes O or T more centrally.

What about ""FLAIR""? But it has R which is absent. Not allowed.

""CHAIN"" we considered.

""THAIL"" is not a word.

""ABOUT"" doesn't have I.

So I think ""PLAIT"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the dictionary. Assuming it is.

Alternatively, ""ADMIN"" is also good because it has N and M, which are common.

But I think testing T is more important than M.

Another word: ""PLANT"" -> but it doesn't have I.

We must have I.

So I'll go with ""PLAIT"".

But wait, in ""PLAIT"", we are putting A in position 3 and I in position 4. We don't know if these positions are correct, but we are testing them.

We could also consider ""OCTAL"" but no I.

After some thought, I think ""PLAIT"" is a good second guess.

Therefore, our next guess is ""PLAIT"".

But let me confirm the spelling: PLAIT is a word meaning a braid of hair or a fold.

Yes.

So we'll guess ""PLAIT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked as ""-"").
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and I, but avoid R, S, E.
- A cannot be placed in position 2, and I cannot be placed in position 3 to maximize new information.
- To test common unused letters (like P, L, T), ""PLAIT"" is chosen:
  - A is placed in position 3 (a new position to test).
  - I is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).
  - P, L, and T are introduced as new letters to gather more feedback.

This guess helps narrow down the positions of A and I while testing three new common consonants.",Guess 2: PLAIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(-),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that can provide maximum information.
 Common initial words in Wordle include words that have a mix of common vowels and consonants.
 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters like R, A, I, S, E, T.

 One such word is ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E which are common letters and are vowels and common consonants.

 But note: the feedback will tell us about the presence and position of each letter.

 So for the first guess, I'll use: RAISE

 However, another popular starting word is ""CRANE"", but since I don't have a strong preference, I'll go with ""SOARE"" (which is a valid word meaning a young hawk) but let me stick to a more common one.

 Alternatively, ""ARISE"" is also common. Actually, ""RAISE"" and ""ARISE"" are very similar.

 I think ""SLATE"" is also a good one because it has S, L, A, T, E.

 Considering maximizing the number of common letters and distinct letters, I choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 But note: we must ensure the word is in the dictionary.

 Since any word is acceptable for the first guess, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 However, let me consider: we might also want to cover vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N).

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning the cumulative amount of money distributed by a business) and has very common letters? But I'll stick to a common one.

 After reviewing, I see that ""RAISE"" is a very common starting word. Let me pick ""RAISE"".

 Step-by-step reasoning:
 1. We need to maximize the information we get from the first guess.
 2. Choosing a word with distinct letters and common letters (vowels and consonants) is important.
 3. ""RAISE"" contains the vowels A, I, E and consonants R, S.
 4. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E — covering common letters.

 But note: the problem doesn't specify the dictionary. However, we can assume that common five-letter words are acceptable.

 Let's go with ""RAISE"".

 If we are not constrained by the actual Wordle dictionary, we'll hope ""RAISE"" is in the dictionary.

 Therefore, our first guess is: RAISE

 Format: <guess>RAISE</guess>For my first guess, I need to maximize information by using common letters and ensuring the word has a mix of vowels and consonants. ""RAISE"" is a strong starting word because it includes three common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all distinct. This helps test multiple frequent letters and positions efficiently.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  I: - (in the word but wrong position)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letters R, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter A is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letter I is in the word but not in the third position.

Also, note that the secret word must contain the letters A and I, but not R, S, E.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the second guess.

Our goal is to make a new guess that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.
2. Contains the letters A and I (since we know they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""RAISE"". Specifically, A cannot be in position 2 and I cannot be in position 3.
3. Avoids the letters R, S, E (since they are not in the word).

Additionally, we want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like T, O, N, L, C, etc.) and avoid repeating the absent letters.

Let's list the constraints for the next guess:
- Must include A and I, but A not in position 2 and I not in position 3.
- Must not include R, S, E.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so there are 3 more letters to discover.

We can consider the positions:
Position 1: cannot be R (since R is absent) and we don't know what it is. But note, we have A and I to place, and they can be in other positions.

We should try to place A and I in positions that are not their original positions in ""RAISE"". Also, we can try to cover other common letters.

Let's think of words that have A and I, and avoid R, S, E.

Common letters we haven't used: T, O, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A, I, and three new letters.

But note: we have two known letters (A and I) and three unknown. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible positions for A: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in our first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, I is in the word but not in position 3.

So for the next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 1, 3, 4, 5) and I in a different position (like 1, 2, 4, 5). But note: we don't want to put I in position 3 because we already know it's not there, and similarly for A in position 2.

But we can try to put A in position 1 and I in position 4, for example.

Let's try to think of words that have A and I, and avoid R, S, E.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> but let's check the positions: A is in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2 because we know it's not in the correct position? Actually, we can put A in position 2 again? But wait, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 2.

However, we are allowed to put A in position 2 again? But that would be inefficient because we already know it's not position 2. So we should try a different position for A to see if it is the correct one.

Similarly for I.

So we should avoid putting A in position 2 and I in position 3 in the next guess.

Therefore, in the next guess, we should put A in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 and I in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Now, let's think of words that fit.

Also, we want to include new common letters.

Let me try to list some words:

Option 1: A in position 1, I in position 4.
Example: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. But does it avoid R,S,E? Yes. But note: we have U, D, O as new letters.

Option 2: A in position 1, I in position 5: e.g., ""ALIBI"" -> A, L, I, B, I. But wait, it has two I's? The word ""ALIBI"" has two I's. But we don't know if the secret word has two I's? The feedback from the first guess only told us that I is present (at least one I). So it could have two I's? But we have to be cautious.

But note: in the first guess, we had one I and it was marked as present. So if the word has two I's, then we might get more information. However, we don't know.

But ""ALIBI"" has I at the end and in the middle? Actually, ""ALIBI"" is A-L-I-B-I, so positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), B(4), I(5). But we cannot put I in position 3 because we know I is not in position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, I is not in position 3. But if we put I in position 3 in our guess, it will be marked as absent? Or wrong? Let me clarify the rules.

The feedback is based on the secret word. If the secret word has only one I and we put two I's, then one of them might be marked as absent. Also, if we put I in position 3 and the secret word has I but not in that position, it will be marked as wrong position? But we already know that position 3 is wrong for I, so it would be redundant.

So to avoid confusion, it's better to use a word with distinct letters if possible.

Therefore, ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate: distinct letters and covers A, U, D, I, O.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""ADMIN"" -> A, D, M, I, N. But I is in position 5? Actually: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). So I is in position 4. This is also good.

But we have to avoid putting A in position 2? In ""ADMIN"", A is in position 1, which is allowed.

Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. Here, A is in position 3 and I in position 4. But note: we have A in position 3? We don't know if that is allowed? We are allowed to try A in position 3. Similarly, I in position 4.

But in ""PLAIT"", the positions are: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), T(5). So A is in 3 and I in 4.

We can also consider ""TAXIS"" but it has S which is absent? We cannot use S because we know S is not in the word. So avoid S.

Similarly, avoid R and E.

So ""PLAIT"" is acceptable? But wait, we don't know if the word has P, L, T. We are testing them.

But note: we are on the second guess, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me compare:

- ""AUDIO"": tests A (position 1), U, D, I (position 4), O.
- ""ADMIN"": tests A (1), D, M, I (4), N.
- ""PLAIT"": tests P, L, A (3), I (4), T.

All are valid.

But we also want to consider the frequency of letters. Common letters like T, N, L, O are good to test.

In ""AUDIO"", we test U and D which are less common. In ""ADMIN"", we test M which is less common than T or L. In ""PLAIT"", we test P, L, T. L and T are very common.

So ""PLAIT"" might be better because it tests common letters.

But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters. ""PLAIT"" does not contain R, S, E.

Another word: ""PLAIN"" -> but that has N, which is common. But I is in position 4? Actually, ""PLAIN"" is P-L-A-I-N, so I is in position 4? Wait, positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N. But we are putting A in position 3 and I in position 4. This is acceptable.

But ""PLAIN"" has A in position 3 and I in position 4, same as ""PLAIT"". But ""PLAIN"" uses N instead of T.

We can also consider ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O. Positions: A in position 2? But we cannot put A in position 2? Because we know A is not in position 2. So if we put A in position 2, we know it will be marked as wrong again. So we should avoid that.

Therefore, ""PATIO"" is not good because it puts A in position 2.

Similarly, ""RADII"" has R and is not allowed.

So let's stick to words that put A in a new position.

Another word: ""MANIA"" -> but it has two A's? And I. But we don't know about duplicates. Also, A is in position 2? Not allowed.

So avoid.

What about ""HAVOC""? But it doesn't have I.

We must include both A and I.

Another word: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y. Positions: A in position 2? Not allowed.

""OASIS"" has S and is not allowed.

""TRAIN"" has R and is not allowed.

So let's go back to ""PLAIT"" or ""AUDIO"" or ""ADMIN"".

I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice because it uses common consonants and places A and I in new positions.

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters? But ""PLAIT"" has distinct letters.

Another word: ""ALIGN"" -> A, L, I, G, N. But I is in position 3? We cannot put I in position 3 because we know it's not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we expect it to be marked as wrong position (if the secret word has I) but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information. Therefore, we should avoid putting I in position 3.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 2.

In ""ALIGN"": A(1), L(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). So I is in position 3, which we want to avoid.

Therefore, we should not use ""ALIGN"".

Similarly, ""CHAIN"" has A in position 3? C(1), H(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). So A in 3 and I in 4. This is acceptable. And it avoids R,S,E.

But we have C, H, N as new letters. H is less common.

I think ""PLAIT"" is better because it has P, L, T which are common.

But let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words. Common letters: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc. But we already know A and I are present, and R, S, E are absent. So we should test T, O, L, N, C, etc.

In ""PLAIT"", we test P, L, T. P is less common than O or N.

Another word: ""TOPAZ"" -> but doesn't have I.

We need a word with A and I.

What about ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T. Positions: A(2) -> not allowed! We cannot put A in position 2.

So ""PAINT"" is invalid for our purpose because it puts A in position 2.

But if we consider ""PAINT"", the A is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we would get a '-' for A again, which we already know. So it's a waste.

Therefore, we avoid.

Another word: ""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L. Positions: A(3), I(4). This is acceptable. But Q and U are less common, and we use two letters for one sound? But it's a valid word.

But we might get less information because Q is rare.

So I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that includes O or T more centrally.

What about ""FLAIR""? But it has R which is absent. Not allowed.

""CHAIN"" we considered.

""THAIL"" is not a word.

""ABOUT"" doesn't have I.

So I think ""PLAIT"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the dictionary. Assuming it is.

Alternatively, ""ADMIN"" is also good because it has N and M, which are common.

But I think testing T is more important than M.

Another word: ""PLANT"" -> but it doesn't have I.

We must have I.

So I'll go with ""PLAIT"".

But wait, in ""PLAIT"", we are putting A in position 3 and I in position 4. We don't know if these positions are correct, but we are testing them.

We could also consider ""OCTAL"" but no I.

After some thought, I think ""PLAIT"" is a good second guess.

Therefore, our next guess is ""PLAIT"".

But let me confirm the spelling: PLAIT is a word meaning a braid of hair or a fold.

Yes.

So we'll guess ""PLAIT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked as ""-"").
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and I, but avoid R, S, E.
- A cannot be placed in position 2, and I cannot be placed in position 3 to maximize new information.
- To test common unused letters (like P, L, T), ""PLAIT"" is chosen:
  - A is placed in position 3 (a new position to test).
  - I is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).
  - P, L, and T are introduced as new letters to gather more feedback.

This guess helps narrow down the positions of A and I while testing three new common consonants.

Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that can provide maximum information.\n Common initial words in Wordle include words that have a mix of common vowels and consonants.\n Let\'s choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters like R, A, I, S, E, T.\n\n One such word is ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E which are common letters and are vowels and common consonants.\n\n But note: the feedback will tell us about the presence and position of each letter.\n\n So for the first guess, I\'ll use: RAISE\n\n However, another popular starting word is ""CRANE"", but since I don\'t have a strong preference, I\'ll go with ""SOARE"" (which is a valid word meaning a young hawk) but let me stick to a more common one.\n\n Alternatively, ""ARISE"" is also common. Actually, ""RAISE"" and ""ARISE"" are very similar.\n\n I think ""SLATE"" is also a good one because it has S, L, A, T, E.\n\n Considering maximizing the number of common letters and distinct letters, I choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.\n\n But note: we must ensure the word is in the dictionary.\n\n Since any word is acceptable for the first guess, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"".\n\n However, let me consider: we might also want to cover vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N).\n\n Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning the cumulative amount of money distributed by a business) and has very common letters? But I\'ll stick to a common one.\n\n After reviewing, I see that ""RAISE"" is a very common starting word. Let me pick ""RAISE"".\n\n Step-by-step reasoning:\n 1. We need to maximize the information we get from the first guess.\n 2. Choosing a word with distinct letters and common letters (vowels and consonants) is important.\n 3. ""RAISE"" contains the vowels A, I, E and consonants R, S.\n 4. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E — covering common letters.\n\n But note: the problem doesn\'t specify the dictionary.

Is a valid 5-letter English word.\n2. Contains the letters A and I (since we know they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""RAISE"". Specifically, A cannot be in position 2 and I cannot be in position 3.\n3. Avoids the letters R, S, E (since they are not in the word).\n\nAdditionally, we want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet (like T, O, N, L, C, etc.) and avoid repeating the absent letters.\n\nLet\'s list the constraints for the next guess:\n- Must include A and I, but A not in position 2 and I not in position 3.\n- Must not include R, S, E.\n\nWe also know that the word has 5 letters, so there are 3 more letters to discover.\n\nWe can consider the positions:\nPosition 1: cannot be R (since R is absent) and we don\'t know what it is. But note, we have A and I to place, and they can be in other positions.\n\nWe should try to place A and I in positions that are not their original positions in ""RAISE"". Also, we can try to cover other common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A and I, and avoid R, S, E.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t used: T, O, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that has A, I, and three new letters.\n\nBut note: we have two known letters (A and I) and three unknown. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nPossible positions for A: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in our first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, I is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nSo for the next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 1, 3, 4, 5) and I in a different position (like 1, 2, 4, 5). But note: we don\'t want to put I in position 3 because we already know it\'s not there, and similarly for A in position 2.\n\nBut we can try to put A in position 1 and I in position 4, for example.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have A and I, and avoid R, S, E.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n- ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> but let\'s check the positions: A is in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2 because we know it\'s not in the correct position? Actually, we can put A in position 2 again? But wait, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put A in position 2 again, we know it will be marked as wrong position again. But we want to try a new position to see if it is the correct one.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to put A in position 2 again? But that would be inefficient because we already know it\'s not position 2. So we should try a different position for A to see if it is the correct one.\n\nSimilarly for I.\n\nSo we should avoid putting A in position 2 and I in position 3 in the next guess.\n\nTherefore, in the next guess, we should put A in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 and I in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that fit.\n\nAlso, we want to include new common letters.\n\nLet me try to list some words:\n\nOption 1: A in position 1, I in position 4.\nExample: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. But does it avoid R,S,E? Yes. But note: we have U, D, O as new letters.\n\nOption 2: A in position 1, I in position 5: e.g., ""ALIBI"" -> A, L, I, B, I. But wait, it has two I\'s? The word ""ALIBI"" has two I\'s. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two I\'s? The feedback from the first guess only told us that I is present (at least one I). So it could have two I\'s? But we have to be cautious.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had one I and it was marked as present. So if the word has two I\'s, then we might get more information. However, we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""ALIBI"" has I at the end and in the middle? Actually, ""ALIBI"" is A-L-I-B-I, so positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), B(4), I(5). But we cannot put I in position 3 because we know I is not in position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, I is not in position 3. But if we put I in position 3 in our guess, it will be marked as absent? Or wrong? Let me clarify the rules.\n\nThe feedback is based on the secret word. If the secret word has only one I and we put two I\'s, then one of them might be marked as absent. Also, if we put I in position 3 and the secret word has I but not in that position, it will be marked as wrong position? But we already know that position 3 is wrong for I, so it would be redundant.\n\nSo to avoid confusion, it\'s better to use a word with distinct letters if possible.\n\nTherefore, ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate: distinct letters and covers A, U, D, I, O.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""ADMIN"" -> A, D, M, I, N. But I is in position 5? Actually: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). So I is in position 4. This is also good.\n\nBut we have to avoid putting A in position 2? In ""ADMIN"", A is in position 1, which is allowed.\n\nAnother word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. Here, A is in position 3 and I in position 4. But note: we have A in position 3? We don\'t know if that is allowed? We are allowed to try A in position 3. Similarly, I in position 4.\n\nBut in ""PLAIT"", the positions are: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), T(5). So A is in 3 and I in 4.\n\nWe can also consider ""TAXIS"" but it has S which is absent? We cannot use S because we know S is not in the word. So avoid S.\n\nSimilarly, avoid R and E.\n\nSo ""PLAIT"" is acceptable? But wait, we don\'t know if the word has P, L, T. We are testing them.\n\nBut note: we are on the second guess, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet me compare:\n\n- ""AUDIO"": tests A (position 1), U, D, I (position 4), O.\n- ""ADMIN"": tests A (1), D, M, I (4), N.\n- ""PLAIT"": tests P, L, A (3), I (4), T.\n\nAll are valid.\n\nBut we also want to consider the frequency of letters. Common letters like T, N, L, O are good to test.\n\nIn ""AUDIO"", we test U and D which are less common. In ""ADMIN"", we test M which is less common than T or L. In ""PLAIT"", we test P, L, T. L and T are very common.\n\nSo ""PLAIT"" might be better because it tests common letters.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the known absent letters. ""PLAIT"" does not contain R, S, E.\n\nAnother word: ""PLAIN"" -> but that has N, which is common. But I is in position 4? Actually, ""PLAIN"" is P-L-A-I-N, so I is in position 4? Wait, positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N. But we are putting A in position 3 and I in position 4. This is acceptable.\n\nBut ""PLAIN"" has A in position 3 and I in position 4, same as ""PLAIT"". But ""PLAIN"" uses N instead of T.\n\nWe can also consider ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O. Positions: A in position 2? But we cannot put A in position 2? Because we know A is not in position 2. So if we put A in position 2, we know it will be marked as wrong again. So we should avoid that.\n\nTherefore, ""PATIO"" is not good because it puts A in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""RADII"" has R and is not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s stick to words that put A in a new position.\n\nAnother word: ""MANIA"" -> but it has two A\'s? And I. But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, A is in position 2? Not allowed.\n\nSo avoid.\n\nWhat about ""HAVOC""? But it doesn\'t have I.\n\nWe must include both A and I.\n\nAnother word: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y. Positions: A in position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""OASIS"" has S and is not allowed.\n\n""TRAIN"" has R and is not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s go back to ""PLAIT"" or ""AUDIO"" or ""ADMIN"".\n\nI think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice because it uses common consonants and places A and I in new positions.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters? But ""PLAIT"" has distinct letters.\n\nAnother word: ""ALIGN"" -> A, L, I, G, N. But I is in position 3? We cannot put I in position 3 because we know it\'s not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we expect it to be marked as wrong position (if the secret word has I) but we already know that. So it doesn\'t give new information. Therefore, we should avoid putting I in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting A in position 2.\n\nIn ""ALIGN"": A(1), L(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). So I is in position 3, which we want to avoid.\n\nTherefore, we should not use ""ALIGN"".\n\nSimilarly, ""CHAIN"" has A in position 3? C(1), H(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). So A in 3 and I in 4. This is acceptable. And it avoids R,S,E.\n\nBut we have C, H, N as new letters. H is less common.\n\nI think ""PLAIT"" is better because it has P, L, T which are common.\n\nBut let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words. Common letters: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc. But we already know A and I are present, and R, S, E are absent. So we should test T, O, L, N, C, etc.\n\nIn ""PLAIT"", we test P, L, T. P is less common than O or N.\n\nAnother word: ""TOPAZ"" -> but doesn\'t have I.\n\nWe need a word with A and I.\n\nWhat about ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T. Positions: A(2) -> not allowed! We cannot put A in position 2.\n\nSo ""PAINT"" is invalid for our purpose because it puts A in position 2.\n\nBut if we consider ""PAINT"", the A is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we would get a \'-\' for A again, which we already know. So it\'s a waste.\n\nTherefore, we avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L. Positions: A(3), I(4). This is acceptable. But Q and U are less common, and we use two letters for one sound? But it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut we might get less information because Q is rare.\n\nSo I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that includes O or T more centrally.\n\nWhat about ""FLAIR""? But it has R which is absent. Not allowed.\n\n""CHAIN"" we considered.\n\n""THAIL"" is not a word.\n\n""ABOUT"" doesn\'t have I.\n\nSo I think ""PLAIT"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the word is in the dictionary. Assuming it is.\n\nAlternatively, ""ADMIN"" is also good because it has N and M, which are common.\n\nBut I think testing T is more important than M.\n\nAnother word: ""PLANT"" -> but it doesn\'t have I.\n\nWe must have I.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""PLAIT"".\n\nBut wait, in ""PLAIT"", we are putting A in position 3 and I in position 4. We don\'t know if these positions are correct, but we are testing them.\n\nWe could also consider ""OCTAL"" but no I.\n\nAfter some thought, I think ""PLAIT"" is a good second guess.\n\nTherefore, our next guess is ""PLAIT"".\n\nBut let me confirm the spelling: PLAIT is a word meaning a braid of hair or a fold.\n\nYes.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""PLAIT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked as ""-"").\n- I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include A and I, but avoid R, S, E.\n- A cannot be placed in position 2, and I cannot be placed in position 3 to maximize new information.\n- To test common unused letters (like P, L, T), ""PLAIT"" is chosen:\n  - A is placed in position 3 (a new position to test).\n  - I is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).\n  - P, L, and T are introduced as new letters to gather more feedback.\n\nThis guess helps narrow down the positions of A and I while testing three new common consonants.\n\n<guess>PLAIT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PLAIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(-), I(-), S(x), E(x)
   - Thus, R, S, E are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

2. Guess 2: PLAIT -> P(x), L(x), A(-), I(✓), T(-)
   - P and L are not in the word (new absences).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed A in position 3 and got '-', meaning wrong position). However, note that we already knew A is in the word from the first guess, and now we know it is not in position 3 either.
   - I is correct at position 4 (so the fourth letter is I).
   - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since we guessed T in position 5 and got '-').

So, summary of knowledge:
- Absent letters: R, S, E, P, L (so avoid these).
- Present letters: A, I, T (and I is fixed at position 4).
- Additionally, A is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess).
- I is confirmed in position 4.
- T is in the word but not in position 5.

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ I _
- Position 4 is I.

The word must contain A and T, and three more letters? Actually, we know the word has A, I, and T. But we don't know the other two letters.

Since we have used 5 distinct letters in previous guesses and we know some are absent, we must consider that there might be duplicate letters? But so far, we haven't encountered any duplicate. However, we cannot rule it out.

We are missing two letters and the positions for A and T (except T not at position 5, and A not at positions 2 or 3).

Also, note that we have two known positions for A: it cannot be at position 2 or 3. And the possible positions for A in a 5-letter word are 1, 4, or 5. But position 4 is occupied by I, so A can be at position 1 or 5.

Similarly, T must be in the word and not at position 5. So T can be at positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is I and position 5 is not T).

So:
- Position 1: could be A or T or a new letter?
- Position 2: could be T or a new letter? (but A cannot be here)
- Position 3: could be T or a new letter? (but A cannot be here)
- Position 4: I (fixed)
- Position 5: could be A (since A can be here) or a new letter? (but T cannot be here)

We know the word must have A, I, T and two other letters that are not R,S,E,P,L.

Our next guess should:
- Include A and T (and of course I at position 4).
- Avoid R,S,E,P,L.
- Place A in either position 1 or 5 (since it can't be in 2 or 3 and 4 is taken by I).
- Place T in position 1, 2, or 3 (since it can't be in 5 and 4 is I).

We also want to test new common letters (like O, N, C, D, U, M, H, etc.) to help find the remaining letters.

Since we have limited information, we should try to cover more ground by including new common letters.

But note: we have only three positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, and 5 (with position 4 fixed as I). And we have two known letters (A and T) that must be placed in these positions appropriately, but one spot will be a new letter. Actually, we have two more letters to find? Or possibly one? Because we have:

- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: ?

And we have to place A and T in two of the positions: one of {1,2,3} for T? Actually, T must be in one of positions 1,2,3. Then A must be in position 1 or 5? So:

Option: 
- If A is at 1, then T at 2 or 3? And position 5 must be a new letter? Or T could be at 1? But then A at 5.
So:
Case 1: A at position 1 -> then T must be at position 2 or 3. And positions 2,3,5: two of them are T and another letter? Actually, not necessarily: T is one letter, so if T is at 2, then position 3 and 5 are new letters. Similarly, if T is at 3, then position 2 and 5 are new.

Case 2: A at position 5 -> then T must be at position 1, 2, or 3. Then positions 1,2,3: one of them is T and the other two are new? Actually, we have one T and two new letters.

We can try to form words.

We need to include the known present letters and try new letters for the remaining slots.

Let me think of common words with I in the fourth position.

Words ending in I: typically not common? But we have possibilities.

For example, if A is at position 5, words ending with ""AI"": like ""PAPAI"" -- not a word. Or ""TACAI"" - not.

Common patterns: 
- Words: _ _ _ I A: but then A is at position 5. And we need T in one of first three. Also, must be a valid word.

Example: 
- If T at position 1, then words starting with T, ending with IA: like TAXIA? Not a word. TANIA? Valid? TANIA: T-A-N-I-A. Positions: T(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5). Note: A is at position 2? But we know A cannot be at position 2 from the first guess. So ""TANIA"" has A in position 2 and 5. But in the first guess, we guessed A in position 2 and got wrong position, so if the secret word had A in position 2, it would have been marked correct? But it was marked wrong position, meaning A is not in position 2. Therefore, we cannot have A in position 2. So in ""TANIA"", the A in position 2 is invalid? But wait: position 2 is still A? And we know A is not fixed in any other position? But we have another A in position 5? So the feedback might consider both? However, for position 2, it would be marked as 'x' because we know A can't be at position 2? But actually, if the secret word has A in position 5 and not in 2, then the A in position 2 would be marked as absent? Or present? Let me simulate:

Suppose secret word has A in position 5 only. Then in ""TANIA"", the A in position 2 is not present in the word? So it would be marked as 'x'? But we already know that A is in the word (from previous feedback). This might be confusing.

Actually, let's recall the rules: each letter mark depends on the actual occurrences. If we guess an extra A and the secret word doesn't have that many, then the first A that matches gets the symbol. But in this case, if secret word has only one A, then if we put an A in an incorrect position and an extra A, one might get 'x'. But we know there is at least one A in the word.

We want to avoid conflicting known information.

Therefore, we must not put A in position 2 at all, because we know it's not there. So we must avoid words that put A in position 2.

In ""TANIA"", we have A at position 2 and 5. We must avoid because the A in position 2 would be forced? And we know it's not position 2.

So only consider words that don't place A in position 2 or 3.

Now, back to forming words:

We have two main cases:

Case 1: A at position 1. Then the word starts with A, and I at 4: A _ _ I _
Example words:
   ABACI? But B might be absent? We don't know. And C? Not common? But avoid P,L,R,S,E. ABACI: A(1), B(2), A(3) -> duplicate? Also A in position 3? We can't have A in position 3? So avoid.
   Actually, no duplicate of A? We don't know. But we'll avoid for now? Or test?
   ACTIN: A(1), C(2), T(3), I(4), N(5). But we have T in position 3? That's acceptable? And N in 5.
   This looks good: ""ACTIN"" is a type of protein? Valid word.
   We avoid R,S,E,P,L. Yes, no problem.

Case 2: A at position 5. Then _ _ _ I A
Example: 
   We need T in 1,2, or 3.
   MANIA: but M? But we haven't ruled out, but we have A at 5? But M is not excluded? Also, we must avoid A in 2: MANI: M(1), A(2) -> A at position 2? So we cannot use MANIA.
   TANIA: but A at 2? Not allowed.
   How about ""MOTIA"": not a word.
   ""COMBIA"": no.
   ""TOMIA"": valid? T(1), O(2), M(3), I(4), A(5). Yes? And no A in forbidden positions? And T at position 1? But T is present so okay. O, M are new.

But let's compare with ""ACTIN"" which we found.

Also, note: in ""ACTIN"", we put A at position 1 (testing that) and T at position 3? And N at 5? And we introduce C and N? Common letters.

Similarly, we can form ""ADMIN"" but we avoided P,L and we know D? But we haven't guessed D. However, we guessed D? Only in ""PLAIT""? We haven't guessed D. Actually, we didn't guess D in previous. But ADMIN has M? We didn't test M.

But in ""ACTIN"", we have:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: C
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: N

We know T is correct? No, T at position 3: but we got a '-' for T in position 5? That doesn't imply T has to be at position 3? It can be elsewhere. Also, we know T is in the word, and now we are testing it at position 3.

But note: we must be cautious because we don't know if T is in another position. But we are testing here.

Another common word: ""ANTIC"": A(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), C(5). But this also puts A at 1 and T at 3. Similar to ACTIN.

But ""ACTIN"" is more common? We can use either.

But what about letter availability? Both are valid.

Alternatively, we can consider words without T at position 3? Since we want to test T in other positions too? For example, T at position 1 or 2.

Let me think if we can put T at position 2? For example, if A is at position 1 and T at 2: A T _ I _
Words: ATTIC -> A(1), T(2), T(3), I(4), C(5). But duplicate T? And we have T at position 2 and 3? If the word has only one T, then we might get less feedback. But it's a valid word. However, we avoid: but also, we don't know if T is duplicated? We can use it? And it avoids R,S,E,P,L.

But let's see: ""ATTIC"" has A in 1, T in 2, T in 3? We get feedback for both T's? And if the secret word has only one T? Then one T might get incorrect.

But note: we don't know the number of T's? We know at least one. So ""ATTIC"" is a candidate.

But we don't want to duplicate T? Or we can? It might be efficient? Not necessarily.

We want to maximize information? To test new letters? So using two new letters is better than duplicating a letter? Therefore, ""ACTIN"" or ""ANTIC"" might be better because they introduce C and N? Or ""ACTIN"" has C and N.

Similarly, we could try to test O? For example, ""APHID"" but has H and D? And P is absent? Cannot use P.

We avoid P? P was absent? Yes, from guess 2: P(x).

So we cannot use P.

Therefore, ""ACTIN"" seems a good candidate.

But consider: we also must consider if A is at position 5? That would be another pattern.

We can try to test both possibilities? But in one guess? Not possible.

We can use a word that tests A at position 1 and T at position 2? Or 1?

Let me try A at position 5: then the word ends with IA. And T somewhere in the first three.

Possible words: must be five letters and avoid A in 2 and 3? And avoid R,S,E,P,L.

Examples:
   OATIA: not a word.
   JUNIA: not common? 
   LUCIA? But not in English? 
   BUTIA: not a word.
   CUTIA? Valid? C-U-T-I-A? Positions: C(1), U(2), T(3), I(4), A(5). This avoids the forbidden letters? And A at 5? T at 3? So we could test T at position 3? And C, U? But U is less common.

Compared to ""ACTIN"", which tests A at 1 and T at 3? And C, N? Both are new.

But ""CUTIA"" is less common? In Wordle, might not be included? We are not told the dictionary? So we stick to ""ACTIN"".

Another word: ""MANIA"": but has A at position 2? Not allowed.

""TONIA"": T(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), A(5). This seems valid? But positions: no A in 2? And we avoid? Let's check: T, O, N, I, A. No R,S,E,P,L. Yes. And T at position 1? Which is possible.

So ""TONIA"" is another candidate? But what is TONIA? It might be a proper name? In common dictionaries?

Similarly, ""ACTIN"" is scientific? But likely acceptable.

Another word: ""AITIN"" not a word.

But ""ACTIN"": A(1), C(2), T(3), I(4), N(5). We get to test A at position 1? And T at position 3? And letters C, N.

Alternatively, ""MECIA"" not a word.

I think ""ACTIN"" is a solid choice.

So we'll go with ""ACTIN"".

But let's double-check:

If we guess ""ACTIN"":
- Position 1: A -> we expect feedback: if correct position? Or if not? We don't know? It could be correct? Or misplaced?
- Position 2: C -> new letter? So we test C: present? Not?
- Position 3: T -> T is present? We already know T is in the word? But position: we get feedback? If it's the correct position for T? Or misplaced?
- Position 4: I -> correct? So we expect ✓
- Position 5: N -> new letter? Tests N: present? not?

Even if A is not at position 1, we will know: if A is marked as present but wrong position? Then A must be at position 5? And similarly for T? And we will see.

So it's a good word.

Therefore, our guess: ""ACTIN"".

Response: <guess>ACTIN</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Absent letters**: R, S, E, P, L (cannot be in the word).
- **Present letters**: A, I, T (with I confirmed at position 4).
- **Constraints**:
  - A is not in positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback).
  - T is not in position 5 (from Guess 2 feedback).
- **Word structure**: `_ _ _ I _` (position 4 is I).
- A must be in position 1 or 5, since positions 2, 3, and 4 are excluded (4 is occupied by I).
- T must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (since it cannot be in position 4 or 5).

For the next guess:
- **Goal**: Test the position of A (either pos. 1 or 5) and T (pos. 1, 2, or 3) while introducing new common letters (e.g., C, N, O) to gather maximum information.
- **Chosen word**: **ACTIN**.
  - A in position 1 (tests if A is correctly placed here).
  - C in position 2 (a new common letter to test).
  - T in position 3 (tests T's position given previous constraints).
  - I fixed at position 4 (known correct).
  - N in position 5 (a new common letter).
- **Why ACTIN?** 
  - It adheres to constraints:
    - Avoids R, S, E, P, L.
    - Places A at position 1 (new position) and T at position 3 (new position).
  - Tests two new high-frequency letters (C and N) and efficiently narrows down possible locations for A and T.
  - Valid English word (e.g., a protein or part of a cell).

If A is not at position 1, feedback will help confirm if A must be at position 5. Similarly, feedback on T (pos. 3) and new letters C/N will provide critical information for subsequent guesses.

<guess>ACTIN</guess>",ACTIN,"We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(-), I(-), S(x), E(x)
   - Thus, R, S, E are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

2. Guess 2: PLAIT -> P(x), L(x), A(-), I(✓), T(-)
   - P and L are not in the word (new absences).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed A in position 3 and got '-', meaning wrong position). However, note that we already knew A is in the word from the first guess, and now we know it is not in position 3 either.
   - I is correct at position 4 (so the fourth letter is I).
   - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since we guessed T in position 5 and got '-').

So, summary of knowledge:
- Absent letters: R, S, E, P, L (so avoid these).
- Present letters: A, I, T (and I is fixed at position 4).
- Additionally, A is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess).
- I is confirmed in position 4.
- T is in the word but not in position 5.

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ I _
- Position 4 is I.

The word must contain A and T, and three more letters? Actually, we know the word has A, I, and T. But we don't know the other two letters.

Since we have used 5 distinct letters in previous guesses and we know some are absent, we must consider that there might be duplicate letters? But so far, we haven't encountered any duplicate. However, we cannot rule it out.

We are missing two letters and the positions for A and T (except T not at position 5, and A not at positions 2 or 3).

Also, note that we have two known positions for A: it cannot be at position 2 or 3. And the possible positions for A in a 5-letter word are 1, 4, or 5. But position 4 is occupied by I, so A can be at position 1 or 5.

Similarly, T must be in the word and not at position 5. So T can be at positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is I and position 5 is not T).

So:
- Position 1: could be A or T or a new letter?
- Position 2: could be T or a new letter? (but A cannot be here)
- Position 3: could be T or a new letter? (but A cannot be here)
- Position 4: I (fixed)
- Position 5: could be A (since A can be here) or a new letter? (but T cannot be here)

We know the word must have A, I, T and two other letters that are not R,S,E,P,L.

Our next guess should:
- Include A and T (and of course I at position 4).
- Avoid R,S,E,P,L.
- Place A in either position 1 or 5 (since it can't be in 2 or 3 and 4 is taken by I).
- Place T in position 1, 2, or 3 (since it can't be in 5 and 4 is I).

We also want to test new common letters (like O, N, C, D, U, M, H, etc.) to help find the remaining letters.

Since we have limited information, we should try to cover more ground by including new common letters.

But note: we have only three positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, and 5 (with position 4 fixed as I). And we have two known letters (A and T) that must be placed in these positions appropriately, but one spot will be a new letter. Actually, we have two more letters to find? Or possibly one? Because we have:

- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: ?

And we have to place A and T in two of the positions: one of {1,2,3} for T? Actually, T must be in one of positions 1,2,3. Then A must be in position 1 or 5? So:

Option: 
- If A is at 1, then T at 2 or 3? And position 5 must be a new letter? Or T could be at 1? But then A at 5.
So:
Case 1: A at position 1 -> then T must be at position 2 or 3. And positions 2,3,5: two of them are T and another letter? Actually, not necessarily: T is one letter, so if T is at 2, then position 3 and 5 are new letters. Similarly, if T is at 3, then position 2 and 5 are new.

Case 2: A at position 5 -> then T must be at position 1, 2, or 3. Then positions 1,2,3: one of them is T and the other two are new? Actually, we have one T and two new letters.

We can try to form words.

We need to include the known present letters and try new letters for the remaining slots.

Let me think of common words with I in the fourth position.

Words ending in I: typically not common? But we have possibilities.

For example, if A is at position 5, words ending with ""AI"": like ""PAPAI"" -- not a word. Or ""TACAI"" - not.

Common patterns: 
- Words: _ _ _ I A: but then A is at position 5. And we need T in one of first three. Also, must be a valid word.

Example: 
- If T at position 1, then words starting with T, ending with IA: like TAXIA? Not a word. TANIA? Valid? TANIA: T-A-N-I-A. Positions: T(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5). Note: A is at position 2? But we know A cannot be at position 2 from the first guess. So ""TANIA"" has A in position 2 and 5. But in the first guess, we guessed A in position 2 and got wrong position, so if the secret word had A in position 2, it would have been marked correct? But it was marked wrong position, meaning A is not in position 2. Therefore, we cannot have A in position 2. So in ""TANIA"", the A in position 2 is invalid? But wait: position 2 is still A? And we know A is not fixed in any other position? But we have another A in position 5? So the feedback might consider both? However, for position 2, it would be marked as 'x' because we know A can't be at position 2? But actually, if the secret word has A in position 5 and not in 2, then the A in position 2 would be marked as absent? Or present? Let me simulate:

Suppose secret word has A in position 5 only. Then in ""TANIA"", the A in position 2 is not present in the word? So it would be marked as 'x'? But we already know that A is in the word (from previous feedback). This might be confusing.

Actually, let's recall the rules: each letter mark depends on the actual occurrences. If we guess an extra A and the secret word doesn't have that many, then the first A that matches gets the symbol. But in this case, if secret word has only one A, then if we put an A in an incorrect position and an extra A, one might get 'x'. But we know there is at least one A in the word.

We want to avoid conflicting known information.

Therefore, we must not put A in position 2 at all, because we know it's not there. So we must avoid words that put A in position 2.

In ""TANIA"", we have A at position 2 and 5. We must avoid because the A in position 2 would be forced? And we know it's not position 2.

So only consider words that don't place A in position 2 or 3.

Now, back to forming words:

We have two main cases:

Case 1: A at position 1. Then the word starts with A, and I at 4: A _ _ I _
Example words:
   ABACI? But B might be absent? We don't know. And C? Not common? But avoid P,L,R,S,E. ABACI: A(1), B(2), A(3) -> duplicate? Also A in position 3? We can't have A in position 3? So avoid.
   Actually, no duplicate of A? We don't know. But we'll avoid for now? Or test?
   ACTIN: A(1), C(2), T(3), I(4), N(5). But we have T in position 3? That's acceptable? And N in 5.
   This looks good: ""ACTIN"" is a type of protein? Valid word.
   We avoid R,S,E,P,L. Yes, no problem.

Case 2: A at position 5. Then _ _ _ I A
Example: 
   We need T in 1,2, or 3.
   MANIA: but M? But we haven't ruled out, but we have A at 5? But M is not excluded? Also, we must avoid A in 2: MANI: M(1), A(2) -> A at position 2? So we cannot use MANIA.
   TANIA: but A at 2? Not allowed.
   How about ""MOTIA"": not a word.
   ""COMBIA"": no.
   ""TOMIA"": valid? T(1), O(2), M(3), I(4), A(5). Yes? And no A in forbidden positions? And T at position 1? But T is present so okay. O, M are new.

But let's compare with ""ACTIN"" which we found.

Also, note: in ""ACTIN"", we put A at position 1 (testing that) and T at position 3? And N at 5? And we introduce C and N? Common letters.

Similarly, we can form ""ADMIN"" but we avoided P,L and we know D? But we haven't guessed D. However, we guessed D? Only in ""PLAIT""? We haven't guessed D. Actually, we didn't guess D in previous. But ADMIN has M? We didn't test M.

But in ""ACTIN"", we have:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: C
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: N

We know T is correct? No, T at position 3: but we got a '-' for T in position 5? That doesn't imply T has to be at position 3? It can be elsewhere. Also, we know T is in the word, and now we are testing it at position 3.

But note: we must be cautious because we don't know if T is in another position. But we are testing here.

Another common word: ""ANTIC"": A(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), C(5). But this also puts A at 1 and T at 3. Similar to ACTIN.

But ""ACTIN"" is more common? We can use either.

But what about letter availability? Both are valid.

Alternatively, we can consider words without T at position 3? Since we want to test T in other positions too? For example, T at position 1 or 2.

Let me think if we can put T at position 2? For example, if A is at position 1 and T at 2: A T _ I _
Words: ATTIC -> A(1), T(2), T(3), I(4), C(5). But duplicate T? And we have T at position 2 and 3? If the word has only one T, then we might get less feedback. But it's a valid word. However, we avoid: but also, we don't know if T is duplicated? We can use it? And it avoids R,S,E,P,L.

But let's see: ""ATTIC"" has A in 1, T in 2, T in 3? We get feedback for both T's? And if the secret word has only one T? Then one T might get incorrect.

But note: we don't know the number of T's? We know at least one. So ""ATTIC"" is a candidate.

But we don't want to duplicate T? Or we can? It might be efficient? Not necessarily.

We want to maximize information? To test new letters? So using two new letters is better than duplicating a letter? Therefore, ""ACTIN"" or ""ANTIC"" might be better because they introduce C and N? Or ""ACTIN"" has C and N.

Similarly, we could try to test O? For example, ""APHID"" but has H and D? And P is absent? Cannot use P.

We avoid P? P was absent? Yes, from guess 2: P(x).

So we cannot use P.

Therefore, ""ACTIN"" seems a good candidate.

But consider: we also must consider if A is at position 5? That would be another pattern.

We can try to test both possibilities? But in one guess? Not possible.

We can use a word that tests A at position 1 and T at position 2? Or 1?

Let me try A at position 5: then the word ends with IA. And T somewhere in the first three.

Possible words: must be five letters and avoid A in 2 and 3? And avoid R,S,E,P,L.

Examples:
   OATIA: not a word.
   JUNIA: not common? 
   LUCIA? But not in English? 
   BUTIA: not a word.
   CUTIA? Valid? C-U-T-I-A? Positions: C(1), U(2), T(3), I(4), A(5). This avoids the forbidden letters? And A at 5? T at 3? So we could test T at position 3? And C, U? But U is less common.

Compared to ""ACTIN"", which tests A at 1 and T at 3? And C, N? Both are new.

But ""CUTIA"" is less common? In Wordle, might not be included? We are not told the dictionary? So we stick to ""ACTIN"".

Another word: ""MANIA"": but has A at position 2? Not allowed.

""TONIA"": T(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), A(5). This seems valid? But positions: no A in 2? And we avoid? Let's check: T, O, N, I, A. No R,S,E,P,L. Yes. And T at position 1? Which is possible.

So ""TONIA"" is another candidate? But what is TONIA? It might be a proper name? In common dictionaries?

Similarly, ""ACTIN"" is scientific? But likely acceptable.

Another word: ""AITIN"" not a word.

But ""ACTIN"": A(1), C(2), T(3), I(4), N(5). We get to test A at position 1? And T at position 3? And letters C, N.

Alternatively, ""MECIA"" not a word.

I think ""ACTIN"" is a solid choice.

So we'll go with ""ACTIN"".

But let's double-check:

If we guess ""ACTIN"":
- Position 1: A -> we expect feedback: if correct position? Or if not? We don't know? It could be correct? Or misplaced?
- Position 2: C -> new letter? So we test C: present? Not?
- Position 3: T -> T is present? We already know T is in the word? But position: we get feedback? If it's the correct position for T? Or misplaced?
- Position 4: I -> correct? So we expect ✓
- Position 5: N -> new letter? Tests N: present? not?

Even if A is not at position 1, we will know: if A is marked as present but wrong position? Then A must be at position 5? And similarly for T? And we will see.

So it's a good word.

Therefore, our guess: ""ACTIN"".

Response: <guess>ACTIN</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Absent letters**: R, S, E, P, L (cannot be in the word).
- **Present letters**: A, I, T (with I confirmed at position 4).
- **Constraints**:
  - A is not in positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback).
  - T is not in position 5 (from Guess 2 feedback).
- **Word structure**: `_ _ _ I _` (position 4 is I).
- A must be in position 1 or 5, since positions 2, 3, and 4 are excluded (4 is occupied by I).
- T must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (since it cannot be in position 4 or 5).

For the next guess:
- **Goal**: Test the position of A (either pos. 1 or 5) and T (pos. 1, 2, or 3) while introducing new common letters (e.g., C, N, O) to gather maximum information.
- **Chosen word**: **ACTIN**.
  - A in position 1 (tests if A is correctly placed here).
  - C in position 2 (a new common letter to test).
  - T in position 3 (tests T's position given previous constraints).
  - I fixed at position 4 (known correct).
  - N in position 5 (a new common letter).
- **Why ACTIN?** 
  - It adheres to constraints:
    - Avoids R, S, E, P, L.
    - Places A at position 1 (new position) and T at position 3 (new position).
  - Tests two new high-frequency letters (C and N) and efficiently narrows down possible locations for A and T.
  - Valid English word (e.g., a protein or part of a cell).

If A is not at position 1, feedback will help confirm if A must be at position 5. Similarly, feedback on T (pos. 3) and new letters C/N will provide critical information for subsequent guesses.",Guess 3: ACTIN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(-) T(✓) I(✓) N(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that can provide maximum information.
 Common initial words in Wordle include words that have a mix of common vowels and consonants.
 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters like R, A, I, S, E, T.

 One such word is ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E which are common letters and are vowels and common consonants.

 But note: the feedback will tell us about the presence and position of each letter.

 So for the first guess, I'll use: RAISE

 However, another popular starting word is ""CRANE"", but since I don't have a strong preference, I'll go with ""SOARE"" (which is a valid word meaning a young hawk) but let me stick to a more common one.

 Alternatively, ""ARISE"" is also common. Actually, ""RAISE"" and ""ARISE"" are very similar.

 I think ""SLATE"" is also a good one because it has S, L, A, T, E.

 Considering maximizing the number of common letters and distinct letters, I choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.

 But note: we must ensure the word is in the dictionary.

 Since any word is acceptable for the first guess, I'll go with ""CRANE"".

 However, let me consider: we might also want to cover vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N).

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning the cumulative amount of money distributed by a business) and has very common letters? But I'll stick to a common one.

 After reviewing, I see that ""RAISE"" is a very common starting word. Let me pick ""RAISE"".

 Step-by-step reasoning:
 1. We need to maximize the information we get from the first guess.
 2. Choosing a word with distinct letters and common letters (vowels and consonants) is important.
 3. ""RAISE"" contains the vowels A, I, E and consonants R, S.
 4. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E — covering common letters.

 But note: the problem doesn't specify the dictionary. However, we can assume that common five-letter words are acceptable.

 Let's go with ""RAISE"".

 If we are not constrained by the actual Wordle dictionary, we'll hope ""RAISE"" is in the dictionary.

 Therefore, our first guess is: RAISE

 Format: <guess>RAISE</guess>For my first guess, I need to maximize information by using common letters and ensuring the word has a mix of vowels and consonants. ""RAISE"" is a strong starting word because it includes three common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all distinct. This helps test multiple frequent letters and positions efficiently.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  I: - (in the word but wrong position)
  S: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
- The letters R, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The letter A is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).
- The letter I is in the word but not in the third position.

Also, note that the secret word must contain the letters A and I, but not R, S, E.

We have 6 tries, and we are on the second guess.

Our goal is to make a new guess that:
1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.
2. Contains the letters A and I (since we know they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""RAISE"". Specifically, A cannot be in position 2 and I cannot be in position 3.
3. Avoids the letters R, S, E (since they are not in the word).

Additionally, we want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include other common letters that we haven't tried yet (like T, O, N, L, C, etc.) and avoid repeating the absent letters.

Let's list the constraints for the next guess:
- Must include A and I, but A not in position 2 and I not in position 3.
- Must not include R, S, E.

We also know that the word has 5 letters, so there are 3 more letters to discover.

We can consider the positions:
Position 1: cannot be R (since R is absent) and we don't know what it is. But note, we have A and I to place, and they can be in other positions.

We should try to place A and I in positions that are not their original positions in ""RAISE"". Also, we can try to cover other common letters.

Let's think of words that have A and I, and avoid R, S, E.

Common letters we haven't used: T, O, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A, I, and three new letters.

But note: we have two known letters (A and I) and three unknown. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

Possible positions for A: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in our first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, I is in the word but not in position 3.

So for the next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 1, 3, 4, 5) and I in a different position (like 1, 2, 4, 5). But note: we don't want to put I in position 3 because we already know it's not there, and similarly for A in position 2.

But we can try to put A in position 1 and I in position 4, for example.

Let's try to think of words that have A and I, and avoid R, S, E.

Some words that come to mind:
- ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> but let's check the positions: A is in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2 because we know it's not in the correct position? Actually, we can put A in position 2 again? But wait, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put A in position 2 again, we know it will be marked as wrong position again. But we want to try a new position to see if it is the correct one.

However, we are allowed to put A in position 2 again? But that would be inefficient because we already know it's not position 2. So we should try a different position for A to see if it is the correct one.

Similarly for I.

So we should avoid putting A in position 2 and I in position 3 in the next guess.

Therefore, in the next guess, we should put A in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 and I in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.

Now, let's think of words that fit.

Also, we want to include new common letters.

Let me try to list some words:

Option 1: A in position 1, I in position 4.
Example: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. But does it avoid R,S,E? Yes. But note: we have U, D, O as new letters.

Option 2: A in position 1, I in position 5: e.g., ""ALIBI"" -> A, L, I, B, I. But wait, it has two I's? The word ""ALIBI"" has two I's. But we don't know if the secret word has two I's? The feedback from the first guess only told us that I is present (at least one I). So it could have two I's? But we have to be cautious.

But note: in the first guess, we had one I and it was marked as present. So if the word has two I's, then we might get more information. However, we don't know.

But ""ALIBI"" has I at the end and in the middle? Actually, ""ALIBI"" is A-L-I-B-I, so positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), B(4), I(5). But we cannot put I in position 3 because we know I is not in position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, I is not in position 3. But if we put I in position 3 in our guess, it will be marked as absent? Or wrong? Let me clarify the rules.

The feedback is based on the secret word. If the secret word has only one I and we put two I's, then one of them might be marked as absent. Also, if we put I in position 3 and the secret word has I but not in that position, it will be marked as wrong position? But we already know that position 3 is wrong for I, so it would be redundant.

So to avoid confusion, it's better to use a word with distinct letters if possible.

Therefore, ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate: distinct letters and covers A, U, D, I, O.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""ADMIN"" -> A, D, M, I, N. But I is in position 5? Actually: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). So I is in position 4. This is also good.

But we have to avoid putting A in position 2? In ""ADMIN"", A is in position 1, which is allowed.

Another word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. Here, A is in position 3 and I in position 4. But note: we have A in position 3? We don't know if that is allowed? We are allowed to try A in position 3. Similarly, I in position 4.

But in ""PLAIT"", the positions are: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), T(5). So A is in 3 and I in 4.

We can also consider ""TAXIS"" but it has S which is absent? We cannot use S because we know S is not in the word. So avoid S.

Similarly, avoid R and E.

So ""PLAIT"" is acceptable? But wait, we don't know if the word has P, L, T. We are testing them.

But note: we are on the second guess, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me compare:

- ""AUDIO"": tests A (position 1), U, D, I (position 4), O.
- ""ADMIN"": tests A (1), D, M, I (4), N.
- ""PLAIT"": tests P, L, A (3), I (4), T.

All are valid.

But we also want to consider the frequency of letters. Common letters like T, N, L, O are good to test.

In ""AUDIO"", we test U and D which are less common. In ""ADMIN"", we test M which is less common than T or L. In ""PLAIT"", we test P, L, T. L and T are very common.

So ""PLAIT"" might be better because it tests common letters.

But note: we have to avoid the known absent letters. ""PLAIT"" does not contain R, S, E.

Another word: ""PLAIN"" -> but that has N, which is common. But I is in position 4? Actually, ""PLAIN"" is P-L-A-I-N, so I is in position 4? Wait, positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N. But we are putting A in position 3 and I in position 4. This is acceptable.

But ""PLAIN"" has A in position 3 and I in position 4, same as ""PLAIT"". But ""PLAIN"" uses N instead of T.

We can also consider ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O. Positions: A in position 2? But we cannot put A in position 2? Because we know A is not in position 2. So if we put A in position 2, we know it will be marked as wrong again. So we should avoid that.

Therefore, ""PATIO"" is not good because it puts A in position 2.

Similarly, ""RADII"" has R and is not allowed.

So let's stick to words that put A in a new position.

Another word: ""MANIA"" -> but it has two A's? And I. But we don't know about duplicates. Also, A is in position 2? Not allowed.

So avoid.

What about ""HAVOC""? But it doesn't have I.

We must include both A and I.

Another word: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y. Positions: A in position 2? Not allowed.

""OASIS"" has S and is not allowed.

""TRAIN"" has R and is not allowed.

So let's go back to ""PLAIT"" or ""AUDIO"" or ""ADMIN"".

I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice because it uses common consonants and places A and I in new positions.

But note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters? But ""PLAIT"" has distinct letters.

Another word: ""ALIGN"" -> A, L, I, G, N. But I is in position 3? We cannot put I in position 3 because we know it's not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we expect it to be marked as wrong position (if the secret word has I) but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information. Therefore, we should avoid putting I in position 3.

Similarly, we should avoid putting A in position 2.

In ""ALIGN"": A(1), L(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). So I is in position 3, which we want to avoid.

Therefore, we should not use ""ALIGN"".

Similarly, ""CHAIN"" has A in position 3? C(1), H(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). So A in 3 and I in 4. This is acceptable. And it avoids R,S,E.

But we have C, H, N as new letters. H is less common.

I think ""PLAIT"" is better because it has P, L, T which are common.

But let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words. Common letters: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc. But we already know A and I are present, and R, S, E are absent. So we should test T, O, L, N, C, etc.

In ""PLAIT"", we test P, L, T. P is less common than O or N.

Another word: ""TOPAZ"" -> but doesn't have I.

We need a word with A and I.

What about ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T. Positions: A(2) -> not allowed! We cannot put A in position 2.

So ""PAINT"" is invalid for our purpose because it puts A in position 2.

But if we consider ""PAINT"", the A is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we would get a '-' for A again, which we already know. So it's a waste.

Therefore, we avoid.

Another word: ""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L. Positions: A(3), I(4). This is acceptable. But Q and U are less common, and we use two letters for one sound? But it's a valid word.

But we might get less information because Q is rare.

So I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice.

But let me see if there is a word that includes O or T more centrally.

What about ""FLAIR""? But it has R which is absent. Not allowed.

""CHAIN"" we considered.

""THAIL"" is not a word.

""ABOUT"" doesn't have I.

So I think ""PLAIT"" is a solid choice.

But note: we have to make sure that the word is in the dictionary. Assuming it is.

Alternatively, ""ADMIN"" is also good because it has N and M, which are common.

But I think testing T is more important than M.

Another word: ""PLANT"" -> but it doesn't have I.

We must have I.

So I'll go with ""PLAIT"".

But wait, in ""PLAIT"", we are putting A in position 3 and I in position 4. We don't know if these positions are correct, but we are testing them.

We could also consider ""OCTAL"" but no I.

After some thought, I think ""PLAIT"" is a good second guess.

Therefore, our next guess is ""PLAIT"".

But let me confirm the spelling: PLAIT is a word meaning a braid of hair or a fold.

Yes.

So we'll guess ""PLAIT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked as ""-"").
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").

For the second guess:
- The word must include A and I, but avoid R, S, E.
- A cannot be placed in position 2, and I cannot be placed in position 3 to maximize new information.
- To test common unused letters (like P, L, T), ""PLAIT"" is chosen:
  - A is placed in position 3 (a new position to test).
  - I is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).
  - P, L, and T are introduced as new letters to gather more feedback.

This guess helps narrow down the positions of A and I while testing three new common consonants.

<guess>PLAIT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLAIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:
1. Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(-), I(-), S(x), E(x)
   - Thus, R, S, E are not in the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - I is in the word but not in position 3.

2. Guess 2: PLAIT -> P(x), L(x), A(-), I(✓), T(-)
   - P and L are not in the word (new absences).
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed A in position 3 and got '-', meaning wrong position). However, note that we already knew A is in the word from the first guess, and now we know it is not in position 3 either.
   - I is correct at position 4 (so the fourth letter is I).
   - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since we guessed T in position 5 and got '-').

So, summary of knowledge:
- Absent letters: R, S, E, P, L (so avoid these).
- Present letters: A, I, T (and I is fixed at position 4).
- Additionally, A is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess).
- I is confirmed in position 4.
- T is in the word but not in position 5.

The secret word has the form: _ _ _ I _
- Position 4 is I.

The word must contain A and T, and three more letters? Actually, we know the word has A, I, and T. But we don't know the other two letters.

Since we have used 5 distinct letters in previous guesses and we know some are absent, we must consider that there might be duplicate letters? But so far, we haven't encountered any duplicate. However, we cannot rule it out.

We are missing two letters and the positions for A and T (except T not at position 5, and A not at positions 2 or 3).

Also, note that we have two known positions for A: it cannot be at position 2 or 3. And the possible positions for A in a 5-letter word are 1, 4, or 5. But position 4 is occupied by I, so A can be at position 1 or 5.

Similarly, T must be in the word and not at position 5. So T can be at positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is I and position 5 is not T).

So:
- Position 1: could be A or T or a new letter?
- Position 2: could be T or a new letter? (but A cannot be here)
- Position 3: could be T or a new letter? (but A cannot be here)
- Position 4: I (fixed)
- Position 5: could be A (since A can be here) or a new letter? (but T cannot be here)

We know the word must have A, I, T and two other letters that are not R,S,E,P,L.

Our next guess should:
- Include A and T (and of course I at position 4).
- Avoid R,S,E,P,L.
- Place A in either position 1 or 5 (since it can't be in 2 or 3 and 4 is taken by I).
- Place T in position 1, 2, or 3 (since it can't be in 5 and 4 is I).

We also want to test new common letters (like O, N, C, D, U, M, H, etc.) to help find the remaining letters.

Since we have limited information, we should try to cover more ground by including new common letters.

But note: we have only three positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, and 5 (with position 4 fixed as I). And we have two known letters (A and T) that must be placed in these positions appropriately, but one spot will be a new letter. Actually, we have two more letters to find? Or possibly one? Because we have:

- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: ?
- Position 3: ?
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: ?

And we have to place A and T in two of the positions: one of {1,2,3} for T? Actually, T must be in one of positions 1,2,3. Then A must be in position 1 or 5? So:

Option: 
- If A is at 1, then T at 2 or 3? And position 5 must be a new letter? Or T could be at 1? But then A at 5.
So:
Case 1: A at position 1 -> then T must be at position 2 or 3. And positions 2,3,5: two of them are T and another letter? Actually, not necessarily: T is one letter, so if T is at 2, then position 3 and 5 are new letters. Similarly, if T is at 3, then position 2 and 5 are new.

Case 2: A at position 5 -> then T must be at position 1, 2, or 3. Then positions 1,2,3: one of them is T and the other two are new? Actually, we have one T and two new letters.

We can try to form words.

We need to include the known present letters and try new letters for the remaining slots.

Let me think of common words with I in the fourth position.

Words ending in I: typically not common? But we have possibilities.

For example, if A is at position 5, words ending with ""AI"": like ""PAPAI"" -- not a word. Or ""TACAI"" - not.

Common patterns: 
- Words: _ _ _ I A: but then A is at position 5. And we need T in one of first three. Also, must be a valid word.

Example: 
- If T at position 1, then words starting with T, ending with IA: like TAXIA? Not a word. TANIA? Valid? TANIA: T-A-N-I-A. Positions: T(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5). Note: A is at position 2? But we know A cannot be at position 2 from the first guess. So ""TANIA"" has A in position 2 and 5. But in the first guess, we guessed A in position 2 and got wrong position, so if the secret word had A in position 2, it would have been marked correct? But it was marked wrong position, meaning A is not in position 2. Therefore, we cannot have A in position 2. So in ""TANIA"", the A in position 2 is invalid? But wait: position 2 is still A? And we know A is not fixed in any other position? But we have another A in position 5? So the feedback might consider both? However, for position 2, it would be marked as 'x' because we know A can't be at position 2? But actually, if the secret word has A in position 5 and not in 2, then the A in position 2 would be marked as absent? Or present? Let me simulate:

Suppose secret word has A in position 5 only. Then in ""TANIA"", the A in position 2 is not present in the word? So it would be marked as 'x'? But we already know that A is in the word (from previous feedback). This might be confusing.

Actually, let's recall the rules: each letter mark depends on the actual occurrences. If we guess an extra A and the secret word doesn't have that many, then the first A that matches gets the symbol. But in this case, if secret word has only one A, then if we put an A in an incorrect position and an extra A, one might get 'x'. But we know there is at least one A in the word.

We want to avoid conflicting known information.

Therefore, we must not put A in position 2 at all, because we know it's not there. So we must avoid words that put A in position 2.

In ""TANIA"", we have A at position 2 and 5. We must avoid because the A in position 2 would be forced? And we know it's not position 2.

So only consider words that don't place A in position 2 or 3.

Now, back to forming words:

We have two main cases:

Case 1: A at position 1. Then the word starts with A, and I at 4: A _ _ I _
Example words:
   ABACI? But B might be absent? We don't know. And C? Not common? But avoid P,L,R,S,E. ABACI: A(1), B(2), A(3) -> duplicate? Also A in position 3? We can't have A in position 3? So avoid.
   Actually, no duplicate of A? We don't know. But we'll avoid for now? Or test?
   ACTIN: A(1), C(2), T(3), I(4), N(5). But we have T in position 3? That's acceptable? And N in 5.
   This looks good: ""ACTIN"" is a type of protein? Valid word.
   We avoid R,S,E,P,L. Yes, no problem.

Case 2: A at position 5. Then _ _ _ I A
Example: 
   We need T in 1,2, or 3.
   MANIA: but M? But we haven't ruled out, but we have A at 5? But M is not excluded? Also, we must avoid A in 2: MANI: M(1), A(2) -> A at position 2? So we cannot use MANIA.
   TANIA: but A at 2? Not allowed.
   How about ""MOTIA"": not a word.
   ""COMBIA"": no.
   ""TOMIA"": valid? T(1), O(2), M(3), I(4), A(5). Yes? And no A in forbidden positions? And T at position 1? But T is present so okay. O, M are new.

But let's compare with ""ACTIN"" which we found.

Also, note: in ""ACTIN"", we put A at position 1 (testing that) and T at position 3? And N at 5? And we introduce C and N? Common letters.

Similarly, we can form ""ADMIN"" but we avoided P,L and we know D? But we haven't guessed D. However, we guessed D? Only in ""PLAIT""? We haven't guessed D. Actually, we didn't guess D in previous. But ADMIN has M? We didn't test M.

But in ""ACTIN"", we have:
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: C
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: I
- Position 5: N

We know T is correct? No, T at position 3: but we got a '-' for T in position 5? That doesn't imply T has to be at position 3? It can be elsewhere. Also, we know T is in the word, and now we are testing it at position 3.

But note: we must be cautious because we don't know if T is in another position. But we are testing here.

Another common word: ""ANTIC"": A(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), C(5). But this also puts A at 1 and T at 3. Similar to ACTIN.

But ""ACTIN"" is more common? We can use either.

But what about letter availability? Both are valid.

Alternatively, we can consider words without T at position 3? Since we want to test T in other positions too? For example, T at position 1 or 2.

Let me think if we can put T at position 2? For example, if A is at position 1 and T at 2: A T _ I _
Words: ATTIC -> A(1), T(2), T(3), I(4), C(5). But duplicate T? And we have T at position 2 and 3? If the word has only one T, then we might get less feedback. But it's a valid word. However, we avoid: but also, we don't know if T is duplicated? We can use it? And it avoids R,S,E,P,L.

But let's see: ""ATTIC"" has A in 1, T in 2, T in 3? We get feedback for both T's? And if the secret word has only one T? Then one T might get incorrect.

But note: we don't know the number of T's? We know at least one. So ""ATTIC"" is a candidate.

But we don't want to duplicate T? Or we can? It might be efficient? Not necessarily.

We want to maximize information? To test new letters? So using two new letters is better than duplicating a letter? Therefore, ""ACTIN"" or ""ANTIC"" might be better because they introduce C and N? Or ""ACTIN"" has C and N.

Similarly, we could try to test O? For example, ""APHID"" but has H and D? And P is absent? Cannot use P.

We avoid P? P was absent? Yes, from guess 2: P(x).

So we cannot use P.

Therefore, ""ACTIN"" seems a good candidate.

But consider: we also must consider if A is at position 5? That would be another pattern.

We can try to test both possibilities? But in one guess? Not possible.

We can use a word that tests A at position 1 and T at position 2? Or 1?

Let me try A at position 5: then the word ends with IA. And T somewhere in the first three.

Possible words: must be five letters and avoid A in 2 and 3? And avoid R,S,E,P,L.

Examples:
   OATIA: not a word.
   JUNIA: not common? 
   LUCIA? But not in English? 
   BUTIA: not a word.
   CUTIA? Valid? C-U-T-I-A? Positions: C(1), U(2), T(3), I(4), A(5). This avoids the forbidden letters? And A at 5? T at 3? So we could test T at position 3? And C, U? But U is less common.

Compared to ""ACTIN"", which tests A at 1 and T at 3? And C, N? Both are new.

But ""CUTIA"" is less common? In Wordle, might not be included? We are not told the dictionary? So we stick to ""ACTIN"".

Another word: ""MANIA"": but has A at position 2? Not allowed.

""TONIA"": T(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), A(5). This seems valid? But positions: no A in 2? And we avoid? Let's check: T, O, N, I, A. No R,S,E,P,L. Yes. And T at position 1? Which is possible.

So ""TONIA"" is another candidate? But what is TONIA? It might be a proper name? In common dictionaries?

Similarly, ""ACTIN"" is scientific? But likely acceptable.

Another word: ""AITIN"" not a word.

But ""ACTIN"": A(1), C(2), T(3), I(4), N(5). We get to test A at position 1? And T at position 3? And letters C, N.

Alternatively, ""MECIA"" not a word.

I think ""ACTIN"" is a solid choice.

So we'll go with ""ACTIN"".

But let's double-check:

If we guess ""ACTIN"":
- Position 1: A -> we expect feedback: if correct position? Or if not? We don't know? It could be correct? Or misplaced?
- Position 2: C -> new letter? So we test C: present? Not?
- Position 3: T -> T is present? We already know T is in the word? But position: we get feedback? If it's the correct position for T? Or misplaced?
- Position 4: I -> correct? So we expect ✓
- Position 5: N -> new letter? Tests N: present? not?

Even if A is not at position 1, we will know: if A is marked as present but wrong position? Then A must be at position 5? And similarly for T? And we will see.

So it's a good word.

Therefore, our guess: ""ACTIN"".

Response: <guess>ACTIN</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Absent letters**: R, S, E, P, L (cannot be in the word).
- **Present letters**: A, I, T (with I confirmed at position 4).
- **Constraints**:
  - A is not in positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback).
  - T is not in position 5 (from Guess 2 feedback).
- **Word structure**: `_ _ _ I _` (position 4 is I).
- A must be in position 1 or 5, since positions 2, 3, and 4 are excluded (4 is occupied by I).
- T must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (since it cannot be in position 4 or 5).

For the next guess:
- **Goal**: Test the position of A (either pos. 1 or 5) and T (pos. 1, 2, or 3) while introducing new common letters (e.g., C, N, O) to gather maximum information.
- **Chosen word**: **ACTIN**.
  - A in position 1 (tests if A is correctly placed here).
  - C in position 2 (a new common letter to test).
  - T in position 3 (tests T's position given previous constraints).
  - I fixed at position 4 (known correct).
  - N in position 5 (a new common letter).
- **Why ACTIN?** 
  - It adheres to constraints:
    - Avoids R, S, E, P, L.
    - Places A at position 1 (new position) and T at position 3 (new position).
  - Tests two new high-frequency letters (C and N) and efficiently narrows down possible locations for A and T.
  - Valid English word (e.g., a protein or part of a cell).

If A is not at position 1, feedback will help confirm if A must be at position 5. Similarly, feedback on T (pos. 3) and new letters C/N will provide critical information for subsequent guesses.

Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that can provide maximum information.\n Common initial words in Wordle include words that have a mix of common vowels and consonants.\n Let\'s choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters like R, A, I, S, E, T.\n\n One such word is ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E which are common letters and are vowels and common consonants.\n\n But note: the feedback will tell us about the presence and position of each letter.\n\n So for the first guess, I\'ll use: RAISE\n\n However, another popular starting word is ""CRANE"", but since I don\'t have a strong preference, I\'ll go with ""SOARE"" (which is a valid word meaning a young hawk) but let me stick to a more common one.\n\n Alternatively, ""ARISE"" is also common. Actually, ""RAISE"" and ""ARISE"" are very similar.\n\n I think ""SLATE"" is also a good one because it has S, L, A, T, E.\n\n Considering maximizing the number of common letters and distinct letters, I choose ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E.\n\n But note: we must ensure the word is in the dictionary.\n\n Since any word is acceptable for the first guess, I\'ll go with ""CRANE"".\n\n However, let me consider: we might also want to cover vowels and consonants. ""CRANE"" has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants (C, R, N).\n\n Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning the cumulative amount of money distributed by a business) and has very common letters? But I\'ll stick to a common one.\n\n After reviewing, I see that ""RAISE"" is a very common starting word. Let me pick ""RAISE"".\n\n Step-by-step reasoning:\n 1. We need to maximize the information we get from the first guess.\n 2. Choosing a word with distinct letters and common letters (vowels and consonants) is important.\n 3. ""RAISE"" contains the vowels A, I, E and consonants R, S.\n 4. Alternatively, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E — covering common letters.\n\n But note: the problem doesn\'t specify the dictionary. However, we can assume that common five-letter words are acceptable.\n\n Let\'s go with ""RAISE"".\n\n If we are not constrained by the actual Wordle dictionary, we\'ll hope ""RAISE"" is in the dictionary.\n\n Therefore, our first guess is: RAISE\n\n Format: <guess>RAISE</guess>For my first guess, I need to maximize information by using common letters and ensuring the word has a mix of vowels and consonants. ""RAISE"" is a strong starting word because it includes three common vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), all distinct. This helps test multiple frequent letters and positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"":\n  R: x (not in the word)\n  A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  I: - (in the word but wrong position)\n  S: x (not in the word)\n  E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from this feedback, we know:\n- The letters R, S, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n- The letter A is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and it was marked as wrong position).\n- The letter I is in the word but not in the third position.\n\nAlso, note that the secret word must contain the letters A and I, but not R, S, E.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and we are on the second guess.\n\nOur goal is to make a new guess that:\n1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.\n2. Contains the letters A and I (since we know they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""RAISE"". Specifically, A cannot be in position 2 and I cannot be in position 3.\n3. Avoids the letters R, S, E (since they are not in the word).\n\nAdditionally, we want to maximize the information we get. So we should try to include other common letters that we haven\'t tried yet (like T, O, N, L, C, etc.) and avoid repeating the absent letters.\n\nLet\'s list the constraints for the next guess:\n- Must include A and I, but A not in position 2 and I not in position 3.\n- Must not include R, S, E.\n\nWe also know that the word has 5 letters, so there are 3 more letters to discover.\n\nWe can consider the positions:\nPosition 1: cannot be R (since R is absent) and we don\'t know what it is. But note, we have A and I to place, and they can be in other positions.\n\nWe should try to place A and I in positions that are not their original positions in ""RAISE"". Also, we can try to cover other common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A and I, and avoid R, S, E.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t used: T, O, N, L, C, U, D, P, M, H, etc.\n\nWe can try to form a word that has A, I, and three new letters.\n\nBut note: we have two known letters (A and I) and three unknown. We want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nPossible positions for A: it cannot be in position 2. So it can be in 1, 3, 4, or 5? But wait, in our first guess, we had A in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A is in the word but not in position 2. Similarly, I is in the word but not in position 3.\n\nSo for the next guess, we can put A in a different position (like 1, 3, 4, 5) and I in a different position (like 1, 2, 4, 5). But note: we don\'t want to put I in position 3 because we already know it\'s not there, and similarly for A in position 2.\n\nBut we can try to put A in position 1 and I in position 4, for example.\n\nLet\'s try to think of words that have A and I, and avoid R, S, E.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n- ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T -> but let\'s check the positions: A is in position 2? We cannot put A in position 2 because we know it\'s not in the correct position? Actually, we can put A in position 2 again? But wait, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not in position 2. So if we put A in position 2 again, we know it will be marked as wrong position again. But we want to try a new position to see if it is the correct one.\n\nHowever, we are allowed to put A in position 2 again? But that would be inefficient because we already know it\'s not position 2. So we should try a different position for A to see if it is the correct one.\n\nSimilarly for I.\n\nSo we should avoid putting A in position 2 and I in position 3 in the next guess.\n\nTherefore, in the next guess, we should put A in one of the positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 and I in one of the positions: 1, 2, 4, 5.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that fit.\n\nAlso, we want to include new common letters.\n\nLet me try to list some words:\n\nOption 1: A in position 1, I in position 4.\nExample: ""AUDIO"" -> A, U, D, I, O. But does it avoid R,S,E? Yes. But note: we have U, D, O as new letters.\n\nOption 2: A in position 1, I in position 5: e.g., ""ALIBI"" -> A, L, I, B, I. But wait, it has two I\'s? The word ""ALIBI"" has two I\'s. But we don\'t know if the secret word has two I\'s? The feedback from the first guess only told us that I is present (at least one I). So it could have two I\'s? But we have to be cautious.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had one I and it was marked as present. So if the word has two I\'s, then we might get more information. However, we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""ALIBI"" has I at the end and in the middle? Actually, ""ALIBI"" is A-L-I-B-I, so positions: A(1), L(2), I(3), B(4), I(5). But we cannot put I in position 3 because we know I is not in position 3? Actually, we know that in the secret word, I is not in position 3. But if we put I in position 3 in our guess, it will be marked as absent? Or wrong? Let me clarify the rules.\n\nThe feedback is based on the secret word. If the secret word has only one I and we put two I\'s, then one of them might be marked as absent. Also, if we put I in position 3 and the secret word has I but not in that position, it will be marked as wrong position? But we already know that position 3 is wrong for I, so it would be redundant.\n\nSo to avoid confusion, it\'s better to use a word with distinct letters if possible.\n\nTherefore, ""AUDIO"" is a good candidate: distinct letters and covers A, U, D, I, O.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""AUDIO"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""ADMIN"" -> A, D, M, I, N. But I is in position 5? Actually: A(1), D(2), M(3), I(4), N(5). So I is in position 4. This is also good.\n\nBut we have to avoid putting A in position 2? In ""ADMIN"", A is in position 1, which is allowed.\n\nAnother word: ""PLAIT"" -> P, L, A, I, T. Here, A is in position 3 and I in position 4. But note: we have A in position 3? We don\'t know if that is allowed? We are allowed to try A in position 3. Similarly, I in position 4.\n\nBut in ""PLAIT"", the positions are: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), T(5). So A is in 3 and I in 4.\n\nWe can also consider ""TAXIS"" but it has S which is absent? We cannot use S because we know S is not in the word. So avoid S.\n\nSimilarly, avoid R and E.\n\nSo ""PLAIT"" is acceptable? But wait, we don\'t know if the word has P, L, T. We are testing them.\n\nBut note: we are on the second guess, so we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet me compare:\n\n- ""AUDIO"": tests A (position 1), U, D, I (position 4), O.\n- ""ADMIN"": tests A (1), D, M, I (4), N.\n- ""PLAIT"": tests P, L, A (3), I (4), T.\n\nAll are valid.\n\nBut we also want to consider the frequency of letters. Common letters like T, N, L, O are good to test.\n\nIn ""AUDIO"", we test U and D which are less common. In ""ADMIN"", we test M which is less common than T or L. In ""PLAIT"", we test P, L, T. L and T are very common.\n\nSo ""PLAIT"" might be better because it tests common letters.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the known absent letters. ""PLAIT"" does not contain R, S, E.\n\nAnother word: ""PLAIN"" -> but that has N, which is common. But I is in position 4? Actually, ""PLAIN"" is P-L-A-I-N, so I is in position 4? Wait, positions: 1:P, 2:L, 3:A, 4:I, 5:N. But we are putting A in position 3 and I in position 4. This is acceptable.\n\nBut ""PLAIN"" has A in position 3 and I in position 4, same as ""PLAIT"". But ""PLAIN"" uses N instead of T.\n\nWe can also consider ""PATIO"": P, A, T, I, O. Positions: A in position 2? But we cannot put A in position 2? Because we know A is not in position 2. So if we put A in position 2, we know it will be marked as wrong again. So we should avoid that.\n\nTherefore, ""PATIO"" is not good because it puts A in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""RADII"" has R and is not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s stick to words that put A in a new position.\n\nAnother word: ""MANIA"" -> but it has two A\'s? And I. But we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, A is in position 2? Not allowed.\n\nSo avoid.\n\nWhat about ""HAVOC""? But it doesn\'t have I.\n\nWe must include both A and I.\n\nAnother word: ""DAILY"" -> D, A, I, L, Y. Positions: A in position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""OASIS"" has S and is not allowed.\n\n""TRAIN"" has R and is not allowed.\n\nSo let\'s go back to ""PLAIT"" or ""AUDIO"" or ""ADMIN"".\n\nI think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice because it uses common consonants and places A and I in new positions.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has duplicate letters? But ""PLAIT"" has distinct letters.\n\nAnother word: ""ALIGN"" -> A, L, I, G, N. But I is in position 3? We cannot put I in position 3 because we know it\'s not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we expect it to be marked as wrong position (if the secret word has I) but we already know that. So it doesn\'t give new information. Therefore, we should avoid putting I in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, we should avoid putting A in position 2.\n\nIn ""ALIGN"": A(1), L(2), I(3), G(4), N(5). So I is in position 3, which we want to avoid.\n\nTherefore, we should not use ""ALIGN"".\n\nSimilarly, ""CHAIN"" has A in position 3? C(1), H(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). So A in 3 and I in 4. This is acceptable. And it avoids R,S,E.\n\nBut we have C, H, N as new letters. H is less common.\n\nI think ""PLAIT"" is better because it has P, L, T which are common.\n\nBut let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words. Common letters: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, etc. But we already know A and I are present, and R, S, E are absent. So we should test T, O, L, N, C, etc.\n\nIn ""PLAIT"", we test P, L, T. P is less common than O or N.\n\nAnother word: ""TOPAZ"" -> but doesn\'t have I.\n\nWe need a word with A and I.\n\nWhat about ""PAINT"": P, A, I, N, T. Positions: A(2) -> not allowed! We cannot put A in position 2.\n\nSo ""PAINT"" is invalid for our purpose because it puts A in position 2.\n\nBut if we consider ""PAINT"", the A is in position 2, which we know is wrong. So we would get a \'-\' for A again, which we already know. So it\'s a waste.\n\nTherefore, we avoid.\n\nAnother word: ""QUAIL"" -> Q, U, A, I, L. Positions: A(3), I(4). This is acceptable. But Q and U are less common, and we use two letters for one sound? But it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut we might get less information because Q is rare.\n\nSo I think ""PLAIT"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that includes O or T more centrally.\n\nWhat about ""FLAIR""? But it has R which is absent. Not allowed.\n\n""CHAIN"" we considered.\n\n""THAIL"" is not a word.\n\n""ABOUT"" doesn\'t have I.\n\nSo I think ""PLAIT"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that the word is in the dictionary. Assuming it is.\n\nAlternatively, ""ADMIN"" is also good because it has N and M, which are common.\n\nBut I think testing T is more important than M.\n\nAnother word: ""PLANT"" -> but it doesn\'t have I.\n\nWe must have I.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""PLAIT"".\n\nBut wait, in ""PLAIT"", we are putting A in position 3 and I in position 4. We don\'t know if these positions are correct, but we are testing them.\n\nWe could also consider ""OCTAL"" but no I.\n\nAfter some thought, I think ""PLAIT"" is a good second guess.\n\nTherefore, our next guess is ""PLAIT"".\n\nBut let me confirm the spelling: PLAIT is a word meaning a braid of hair or a fold.\n\nYes.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""PLAIT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R, S, and E are not in the secret word (marked as ""x"").\n- A is in the word but not in position 2 (marked as ""-"").\n- I is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as ""-"").\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include A and I, but avoid R, S, E.\n- A cannot be placed in position 2, and I cannot be placed in position 3 to maximize new information.\n- To test common unused letters (like P, L, T), ""PLAIT"" is chosen:\n  - A is placed in position 3 (a new position to test).\n  - I is placed in position 4 (a new position to test).\n  - P, L, and T are introduced as new letters to gather more feedback.\n\nThis guess helps narrow down the positions of A and I while testing three new common consonants.\n\n<guess>PLAIT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PLAIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n1. Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x), A(-), I(-), S(x), E(x)\n   - Thus, R, S, E are not in the word.\n   - A is in the word but not in position 2.\n   - I is in the word but not in position 3.\n\n2. Guess 2: PLAIT -> P(x), L(x), A(-), I(✓), T(-)\n   - P and L are not in the word (new absences).\n   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed A in position 3 and got \'-\', meaning wrong position). However, note that we already knew A is in the word from the first guess, and now we know it is not in position 3 either.\n   - I is correct at position 4 (so the fourth letter is I).\n   - T is in the word but not in position 5 (since we guessed T in position 5 and got \'-\').\n\nSo, summary of knowledge:\n- Absent letters: R, S, E, P, L (so avoid these).\n- Present letters: A, I, T (and I is fixed at position 4).\n- Additionally, A is not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess).\n- I is confirmed in position 4.\n- T is in the word but not in position 5.\n\nThe secret word has the form: _ _ _ I _\n- Position 4 is I.\n\nThe word must contain A and T, and three more letters? Actually, we know the word has A, I, and T. But we don\'t know the other two letters.\n\nSince we have used 5 distinct letters in previous guesses and we know some are absent, we must consider that there might be duplicate letters? But so far, we haven\'t encountered any duplicate. However, we cannot rule it out.\n\nWe are missing two letters and the positions for A and T (except T not at position 5, and A not at positions 2 or 3).\n\nAlso, note that we have two known positions for A: it cannot be at position 2 or 3. And the possible positions for A in a 5-letter word are 1, 4, or 5. But position 4 is occupied by I, so A can be at position 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, T must be in the word and not at position 5. So T can be at positions 1, 2, or 3 (since position 4 is I and position 5 is not T).\n\nSo:\n- Position 1: could be A or T or a new letter?\n- Position 2: could be T or a new letter? (but A cannot be here)\n- Position 3: could be T or a new letter? (but A cannot be here)\n- Position 4: I (fixed)\n- Position 5: could be A (since A can be here) or a new letter? (but T cannot be here)\n\nWe know the word must have A, I, T and two other letters that are not R,S,E,P,L.\n\nOur next guess should:\n- Include A and T (and of course I at position 4).\n- Avoid R,S,E,P,L.\n- Place A in either position 1 or 5 (since it can\'t be in 2 or 3 and 4 is taken by I).\n- Place T in position 1, 2, or 3 (since it can\'t be in 5 and 4 is I).\n\nWe also want to test new common letters (like O, N, C, D, U, M, H, etc.) to help find the remaining letters.\n\nSince we have limited information, we should try to cover more ground by including new common letters.\n\nBut note: we have only three positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, and 5 (with position 4 fixed as I). And we have two known letters (A and T) that must be placed in these positions appropriately, but one spot will be a new letter. Actually, we have two more letters to find? Or possibly one? Because we have:\n\n- Position 1: ?\n- Position 2: ?\n- Position 3: ?\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: ?\n\nAnd we have to place A and T in two of the positions: one of {1,2,3} for T? Actually, T must be in one of positions 1,2,3. Then A must be in position 1 or 5? So:\n\nOption: \n- If A is at 1, then T at 2 or 3? And position 5 must be a new letter? Or T could be at 1? But then A at 5.\nSo:\nCase 1: A at position 1 -> then T must be at position 2 or 3. And positions 2,3,5: two of them are T and another letter? Actually, not necessarily: T is one letter, so if T is at 2, then position 3 and 5 are new letters. Similarly, if T is at 3, then position 2 and 5 are new.\n\nCase 2: A at position 5 -> then T must be at position 1, 2, or 3. Then positions 1,2,3: one of them is T and the other two are new? Actually, we have one T and two new letters.\n\nWe can try to form words.\n\nWe need to include the known present letters and try new letters for the remaining slots.\n\nLet me think of common words with I in the fourth position.\n\nWords ending in I: typically not common? But we have possibilities.\n\nFor example, if A is at position 5, words ending with ""AI"": like ""PAPAI"" -- not a word. Or ""TACAI"" - not.\n\nCommon patterns: \n- Words: _ _ _ I A: but then A is at position 5. And we need T in one of first three. Also, must be a valid word.\n\nExample: \n- If T at position 1, then words starting with T, ending with IA: like TAXIA? Not a word. TANIA? Valid? TANIA: T-A-N-I-A. Positions: T(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5). Note: A is at position 2? But we know A cannot be at position 2 from the first guess. So ""TANIA"" has A in position 2 and 5. But in the first guess, we guessed A in position 2 and got wrong position, so if the secret word had A in position 2, it would have been marked correct? But it was marked wrong position, meaning A is not in position 2. Therefore, we cannot have A in position 2. So in ""TANIA"", the A in position 2 is invalid? But wait: position 2 is still A? And we know A is not fixed in any other position? But we have another A in position 5? So the feedback might consider both? However, for position 2, it would be marked as \'x\' because we know A can\'t be at position 2? But actually, if the secret word has A in position 5 and not in 2, then the A in position 2 would be marked as absent? Or present? Let me simulate:\n\nSuppose secret word has A in position 5 only. Then in ""TANIA"", the A in position 2 is not present in the word? So it would be marked as \'x\'? But we already know that A is in the word (from previous feedback). This might be confusing.\n\nActually, let\'s recall the rules: each letter mark depends on the actual occurrences. If we guess an extra A and the secret word doesn\'t have that many, then the first A that matches gets the symbol. But in this case, if secret word has only one A, then if we put an A in an incorrect position and an extra A, one might get \'x\'. But we know there is at least one A in the word.\n\nWe want to avoid conflicting known information.\n\nTherefore, we must not put A in position 2 at all, because we know it\'s not there. So we must avoid words that put A in position 2.\n\nIn ""TANIA"", we have A at position 2 and 5. We must avoid because the A in position 2 would be forced? And we know it\'s not position 2.\n\nSo only consider words that don\'t place A in position 2 or 3.\n\nNow, back to forming words:\n\nWe have two main cases:\n\nCase 1: A at position 1. Then the word starts with A, and I at 4: A _ _ I _\nExample words:\n   ABACI? But B might be absent? We don\'t know. And C? Not common? But avoid P,L,R,S,E. ABACI: A(1), B(2), A(3) -> duplicate? Also A in position 3? We can\'t have A in position 3? So avoid.\n   Actually, no duplicate of A? We don\'t know. But we\'ll avoid for now? Or test?\n   ACTIN: A(1), C(2), T(3), I(4), N(5). But we have T in position 3? That\'s acceptable? And N in 5.\n   This looks good: ""ACTIN"" is a type of protein? Valid word.\n   We avoid R,S,E,P,L. Yes, no problem.\n\nCase 2: A at position 5. Then _ _ _ I A\nExample: \n   We need T in 1,2, or 3.\n   MANIA: but M? But we haven\'t ruled out, but we have A at 5? But M is not excluded? Also, we must avoid A in 2: MANI: M(1), A(2) -> A at position 2? So we cannot use MANIA.\n   TANIA: but A at 2? Not allowed.\n   How about ""MOTIA"": not a word.\n   ""COMBIA"": no.\n   ""TOMIA"": valid? T(1), O(2), M(3), I(4), A(5). Yes? And no A in forbidden positions? And T at position 1? But T is present so okay. O, M are new.\n\nBut let\'s compare with ""ACTIN"" which we found.\n\nAlso, note: in ""ACTIN"", we put A at position 1 (testing that) and T at position 3? And N at 5? And we introduce C and N? Common letters.\n\nSimilarly, we can form ""ADMIN"" but we avoided P,L and we know D? But we haven\'t guessed D. However, we guessed D? Only in ""PLAIT""? We haven\'t guessed D. Actually, we didn\'t guess D in previous. But ADMIN has M? We didn\'t test M.\n\nBut in ""ACTIN"", we have:\n- Position 1: A\n- Position 2: C\n- Position 3: T\n- Position 4: I\n- Position 5: N\n\nWe know T is correct? No, T at position 3: but we got a \'-\' for T in position 5? That doesn\'t imply T has to be at position 3? It can be elsewhere. Also, we know T is in the word, and now we are testing it at position 3.\n\nBut note: we must be cautious because we don\'t know if T is in another position. But we are testing here.\n\nAnother common word: ""ANTIC"": A(1), N(2), T(3), I(4), C(5). But this also puts A at 1 and T at 3. Similar to ACTIN.\n\nBut ""ACTIN"" is more common? We can use either.\n\nBut what about letter availability? Both are valid.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider words without T at position 3? Since we want to test T in other positions too? For example, T at position 1 or 2.\n\nLet me think if we can put T at position 2? For example, if A is at position 1 and T at 2: A T _ I _\nWords: ATTIC -> A(1), T(2), T(3), I(4), C(5). But duplicate T? And we have T at position 2 and 3? If the word has only one T, then we might get less feedback. But it\'s a valid word. However, we avoid: but also, we don\'t know if T is duplicated? We can use it? And it avoids R,S,E,P,L.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""ATTIC"" has A in 1, T in 2, T in 3? We get feedback for both T\'s? And if the secret word has only one T? Then one T might get incorrect.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know the number of T\'s? We know at least one. So ""ATTIC"" is a candidate.\n\nBut we don\'t want to duplicate T? Or we can? It might be efficient? Not necessarily.\n\nWe want to maximize information? To test new letters? So using two new letters is better than duplicating a letter? Therefore, ""ACTIN"" or ""ANTIC"" might be better because they introduce C and N? Or ""ACTIN"" has C and N.\n\nSimilarly, we could try to test O? For example, ""APHID"" but has H and D? And P is absent? Cannot use P.\n\nWe avoid P? P was absent? Yes, from guess 2: P(x).\n\nSo we cannot use P.\n\nTherefore, ""ACTIN"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut consider: we also must consider if A is at position 5? That would be another pattern.\n\nWe can try to test both possibilities? But in one guess? Not possible.\n\nWe can use a word that tests A at position 1 and T at position 2? Or 1?\n\nLet me try A at position 5: then the word ends with IA. And T somewhere in the first three.\n\nPossible words: must be five letters and avoid A in 2 and 3? And avoid R,S,E,P,L.\n\nExamples:\n   OATIA: not a word.\n   JUNIA: not common? \n   LUCIA? But not in English? \n   BUTIA: not a word.\n   CUTIA? Valid? C-U-T-I-A? Positions: C(1), U(2), T(3), I(4), A(5). This avoids the forbidden letters? And A at 5? T at 3? So we could test T at position 3? And C, U? But U is less common.\n\nCompared to ""ACTIN"", which tests A at 1 and T at 3? And C, N? Both are new.\n\nBut ""CUTIA"" is less common? In Wordle, might not be included? We are not told the dictionary? So we stick to ""ACTIN"".\n\nAnother word: ""MANIA"": but has A at position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""TONIA"": T(1), O(2), N(3), I(4), A(5). This seems valid? But positions: no A in 2? And we avoid? Let\'s check: T, O, N, I, A. No R,S,E,P,L. Yes. And T at position 1? Which is possible.\n\nSo ""TONIA"" is another candidate? But what is TONIA? It might be a proper name? In common dictionaries?\n\nSimilarly, ""ACTIN"" is scientific? But likely acceptable.\n\nAnother word: ""AITIN"" not a word.\n\nBut ""ACTIN"": A(1), C(2), T(3), I(4), N(5). We get to test A at position 1? And T at position 3? And letters C, N.\n\nAlternatively, ""MECIA"" not a word.\n\nI think ""ACTIN"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo we\'ll go with ""ACTIN"".\n\nBut let\'s double-check:\n\nIf we guess ""ACTIN"":\n- Position 1: A -> we expect feedback: if correct position? Or if not? We don\'t know? It could be correct? Or misplaced?\n- Position 2: C -> new letter? So we test C: present? Not?\n- Position 3: T -> T is present? We already know T is in the word? But position: we get feedback? If it\'s the correct position for T? Or misplaced?\n- Position 4: I -> correct? So we expect ✓\n- Position 5: N -> new letter? Tests N: present? not?\n\nEven if A is not at position 1, we will know: if A is marked as present but wrong position? Then A must be at position 5? And similarly for T? And we will see.\n\nSo it\'s a good word.\n\nTherefore, our guess: ""ACTIN"".\n\nResponse: <guess>ACTIN</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n- **Absent letters**: R, S, E, P, L (cannot be in the word).\n- **Present letters**: A, I, T (with I confirmed at position 4).\n- **Constraints**:\n  - A is not in positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and Guess 2 feedback).\n  - T is not in position 5 (from Guess 2 feedback).\n- **Word structure**: `_ _ _ I _` (position 4 is I).\n- A must be in position 1 or 5, since positions 2, 3, and 4 are excluded (4 is occupied by I).\n- T must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (since it cannot be in position 4 or 5).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- **Goal**: Test the position of A (either pos. 1 or 5) and T (pos. 1, 2, or 3) while introducing new common letters (e.g., C, N, O) to gather maximum information.\n- **Chosen word**: **ACTIN**.\n  - A in position 1 (tests if A is correctly placed here).\n  - C in position 2 (a new common letter to test).\n  - T in position 3 (tests T\'s position given previous constraints).\n  - I fixed at position 4 (known correct).\n  - N in position 5 (a new common letter).\n- **Why ACTIN?** \n  - It adheres to constraints:\n    - Avoids R, S, E, P, L.\n    - Places A at position 1 (new position) and T at position 3 (new position).\n  - Tests two new high-frequency letters (C and N) and efficiently narrows down possible locations for A and T.\n  - Valid English word (e.g., a protein or part of a cell).\n\nIf A is not at position 1, feedback will help confirm if A must be at position 5. Similarly, feedback on T (pos. 3) and new letters C/N will provide critical information for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>ACTIN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PLAIT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(-)\nGuess 3: ACTIN -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) C(-) T(✓) I(✓) N(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Absent letters: R, S, E
   - A is in the word but not in position 2
   - I is in the word but not in position 3

2. Guess 2: PLAIT -> P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(-)
   - Absent letters: P, L (added to R, S, E)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3
   - I is correct in position 4
   - T is in the word but not in position 5

3. Guess 3: ACTIN -> A(✓) C(-) T(✓) I(✓) N(x)
   - A is correct in position 1
   - C is in the word but not in position 2
   - T is correct in position 3
   - I is correct in position 4 (already known)
   - N is not in the word, so N is absent

Now, summary of known information:

- Correct positions:
  - Position 1: A (from Guess 3)
  - Position 3: T (from Guess 3)
  - Position 4: I (from Guess 2)

- Incorrect positions for letters:
  - C is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2 (so must be in position 2 or 5? Wait, positions: only position 5 is left? But hold on...)

The word structure: A _ T I _
Positions: 1: A, 2: ?, 3: T, 4: I, 5: ?

We also know:
- Absent letters: R, S, E, P, L, N
- Present letters (not yet placed): C (known from Guess 3 feedback: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 2)

Therefore, since position 2 is not C, and the only unknown positions are 2 and 5, C must be in position 5? Or could it be elsewhere? But we have positions:
- Pos 1: A (fixed)
- Pos 2: unknown
- Pos 3: T (fixed)
- Pos 4: I (fixed)
- Pos 5: unknown

Present letters: we know C is in the word (and only two unknown positions: 2 and 5). So C must be in position 5? Or it could be in position 2? Wait, no: in Guess 3, we guessed C in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning C is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, C cannot be in position 2. So C must be in position 5? Because that's the only other position? Yes.

But note: could there be duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far. But we must consider? We don't know.

Therefore, we can deduce:
- Position 5 must be C? But let's confirm:

The word is A, _, T, I, _ 
We know the fifth letter must be C because:
- C is present (from feedback) and absent at position 2, so must be at position 5? Since position 1, 3, and 4 are taken by A, T, I respectively. So position 2 and 5: C cannot be at position 2, so it must be at position 5? Therefore, position 5 is C.

But then position 2 must be some other letter? But wait: we have only five positions. All letters? We have A, T, I, C, and the letter in position 2? We know C is in the word? But we also have a letter for position 2? And we don't have duplicates? So the word should be: A _ T I C, but we need to find the letter at position 2.

But from Guess 3: we have N absent? And other absent letters? But we don't know what position 2 is.

Moreover, we know C is present? And we placed it at position 5? But in our guess 3 (ACTIN) we placed N at position 5? And we got N(x)? So position 5 cannot be N? But we haven't guessed C at position 5? We placed C at 2? Not 5.

But now, we know C must be somewhere? And the only possibility is position 5? Because position 2 is not C? And other positions are fixed? So the word is A, ?, T, I, C? For position 5? And the missing letter is position 2.

We also know that position 5 must be a letter that hasn't been excluded? What about the letter at position 2? We need to find one letter that completes the word? But we have constraints:

- The word must include C (which we now place at position 5?).
- And the letter in position 2 must be a letter not in the absent list? Not R,S,E,P,L,N? And must be present? We haven't guessed position 2 yet? Actually, we haven't tested the letter at position 2 explicitly? Except that in Guess 3, we tried C there? So we tested a letter? Only at position 2? We tried C? But not other letters? So position 2 is unknown? But we must find a letter for it? And it must be in the word? Or could it be absent? We don't know? Because the secret word could be any valid word? But we know all letters? Let's see.

We have five letters: A at 1, T at 3, I at 4, and C must be somewhere? And we know C is not at 2? So only position 5? Therefore, position 5 is C? Then the word is: A ? T I C

Position 2 must be filled with some letter? That letter must:
- Not be in the absent list: R, S, E, P, L, N
- Be present? How do we know? We don't have feedback about it? But we know the word must have five letters? So position 2 must have a letter? And if we know that C is at 5? And A,T,I are at 1,3,4? Then position 2 must be some other letter? If that letter hasn't been guessed? Then it could be almost anything? But we have to consider duplicates? But we don't have duplicates? But we haven't tested? So let's assume no duplicates? Then the letter at position 2 is another letter.

We also note that in Guess 3, we got C(-), meaning C is in the word? But not at position 2? So yes? And C must be in one of the other positions? But position 1,3,4 are taken by A,T,I? So only position 5? So C must be at position 5? Therefore, the word is: A + [letter at position 2] + T + I + C

We need to find the letter for position 2? But we don't have any additional information? We must avoid the absent letters? So find a letter that is:
- Not R, S, E, P, L, N
- And must form a valid word: ""A?TIC"" 

Possible words: The pattern is A_TIC? We need English words that fit: A?TIC? 

Common letters: 
- Possible: ACTIC? But what? Actually, we have A?TIC? So the missing letter at position 2? 

The only word that matches this pattern? We know C is at position 5? So the word ends in ""TIC"". So ""A_TIC"" words? 

Examples: 
- ATTIC? But we have T at position 3? And I at 4? C at 5? But position 2? So A+T+TIC? But then we have two T's? Also, the word ""ATTIC"": A(1), T(2), T(3), I(4), C(5). But note: we have T both at position 2 and position 3? But we got T(✓) at position 3? And T was known to be present? But if we put T at position 2? Then that T? In guess 3, we guessed ACTIN? We didn't guess T at position 2? So we don't know?

But let's see the constraints: 
- In Guess 3, we guessed ACTIN: A C T I N? And got C(-)? Which says C is present but not position 2? 
- We also got N(x)? So N absent?
- And T(✓) at position 3? So T is at position 3? Therefore, the secret word has T only at position 3? Or possibly multiple? But if we consider ""ATTIC""? The secret word could be ""ATTIC""? Then it would have T at position 2 and 3? 

However, check Guess 2: PLAIT? We guessed T at position 5? And got '-'? Meaning T is in the word? But not at position 5? Which is consistent? And T was not excluded? So ""ATTIC"" is possible? Because T is at both position 2 and 3? 

But let's verify the feedback consistency? 
For Guess 3, if the secret word is ""ATTIC"", and we guessed ""ACTIN""? 
- Position 1: A? Correct? So ✓
- Position 2: C? Secret has T? So C is not present? But we got C(-)? Which says C is present? But in ""ATTIC"", there is no C? Wait, ""ATTIC"" has C at position 5? Yes: A-T-T-I-C? So ""ATTIC""? Letters: A, T, T, I, C? So it has C? And we guessed C at position 2? But the secret word? Position 2 is T? Not C? So C is present (at position 5)? But we guessed? 

In the feedback system? We get letter-wise feedback? And for C? Even though we put C at position 2? But it is at position 5? So we get '-'? Meaning that C is in the word? But not at position 2? Which matches? 

Similarly, for the letter? We guessed: 
- Position 1: A? ✓
- Position 2: C? → '-' because C is present but in wrong position? Since it was actually at position 5? 
- Position 3: T? Secret has T at position 3? So ✓
- Position 4: I? ✓
- Position 5: N? Secret has C? Not N? So N(x)? Which matches? 

So ""ATTIC"" fits? But wait: the secret word ""ATTIC"" has position 2? T? But we have T at position 3? And there's also another T? 

But let's see: does it violate any previous feedback?
- Guess 1: RAISE? 
  - R(x): not in word? Correct? 
  - A(-): A is present? At position 1? Why marked wrong? Wait, in RAISE? We had: R A I S E? Position? Position 1: R? Absent? Position 2: A? Secret word ""ATTIC"" has A at position 1? But we guessed at position 2? So A is present? But in wrong position? So '-'? 
  - I(-): I is at position 4? Secret? At position 4? But we guessed at position 3? So I is present? Not at position 3? So '-'? 
  - S(x)? Correct? 
  - E(x)? Correct? 

Guess 2: PLAIT? 
  - P(x)? Correct? 
  - L(x)? 
  - A(-): We guessed A at position 3? Secret? Position 1? So A is present? Not at position 3? So '-'? 
  - I(✓): Position 4? Correct? 
  - T(-): We guessed T at position 5? Secret: T at positions 2 and 3? But position 5? No? So T is in word? But not at position 5? So '-'? And it doesn't specify that one of the T's is matched? So it's okay? 

So ""ATTIC"" fits? 

But wait? Is ""ATTIC"" acceptable? Yes? 

Therefore? The secret word might be ""ATTIC""? But we are asked to guess? So we can guess ""ATTIC""? 

But why didn't we think about it before? 

But we got N(x) meaning N is absent? So the fifth letter? We thought C? But in ATTIC? Position 5 is C? And position 2 is T? Which we have? 

But we must consider: is there any other word? 

Another word: ARTIC? But A is fixed? But ARTIC? A, R? But R is absent? Cannot? Because R is excluded? 

Or? ""AFTIC""? Not a word? 

""ALTIC""? L excluded? 

""APTIC""? P excluded? 

So possible words: only ""ATTIC""? 

But what about ""ATTIC"" vs ""ANTIC""? But N is absent? In ""ANTIC""? We have N? But we got N(x)? So ""ANTIC"" cannot be? Because it would have N at position 5? But we know N is absent? So only ""ATTIC""? 

But how about duplicate letters? Are there other words? 

For example? ""AFRIC"" but F? And R? R,S,E excluded? 

No? So I think ""ATTIC"" is the only possibility? 

Then we should guess ""ATTIC""? 

But let me confirm the pattern? ""ATTIC"": 

Position: A(1), T(2), T(3), I(4), C(5)? 

But earlier we deduced that position 5 is C? And position 3 is T? Fixed? And position 2? We didn't know? But ""ATTIC"" has T at position 2? 

And T? We know from Guess 3 that T is at position 3? But we didn't know? That? But we guessed T at position 3? And got ✓? So T is at position 3? So in ""ATTIC""? Position 3 has T? Correct? And position 2? Also T? But that is allowed? 

And we also have C at position 5? 

So yes? 

Therefore? We can guess ""ATTIC""? 

But note: in Guess 3? We have not tested position 2? So it could be T? Or other? But the letter must not be excluded? And must result in a word? 

Given the constraints? ""ATTIC"" seems to be the only word that fits? 

So let's guess ""ATTIC""? 

But note: we are allowed to guess words with duplicate letters? So that's fine? 

Therefore? for the fourth guess? ATTIC? 

But wait? We are on the fourth guess? We might not need to? But given the information? 

Alternative? We can think: we know position 2 must be a letter that we haven't excluded? And form ""A_TIC"" words? 

Possible words ending in TIC? And start with A? 

- ATTIC? 
- ARTIC? excluded? (R) 
- ANTIC? excluded? (N) 
- AOTIC? Not a word? 
- ACTIC? ACTIC: A C T I C? But we know from Guess 3 that C is not in position 2? So if the word is ""ACTIC"": A(1), C(2), T(3), I(4), C(5). But we guessed C at position 2? And got '-'? Meaning C is present but not at position 2? But if the word has C at position 2? It would be marked ✓? But we got '-'? So secret word cannot have C at position 2? Therefore ""ACTIC"" would only be allowed if C is not at position 2? But in ""ACTIC"", position 2 is C? Then we would have got ✓ for position 2? But we got '-'? So ""ACTIC"" cannot be? 

So only ""ATTIC"" fits? 

But what about other words? 

Like ""ABTIC""? Not a word? 

Thus? ""ATTIC"" is the only possibility? 

Therefore? we guess ""ATTIC""? 

So final answer? <guess>ATTIC</guess>
</think>
### Analysis of Previous Feedback
Here's a step-by-step breakdown based on all feedback provided:

1. **Guess 1 (RAISE) Feedback**:  
   - R(x), S(x), E(x): Letters **R**, **S**, **E** are **not** in the word.  
   - A(-): **A** is present but **not in position 2**.  
   - I(-): **I** is present but **not in position 3**.  

2. **Guess 2 (PLAIT) Feedback**:  
   - P(x), L(x): **P** and **L** are **not** in the word.  
   - A(-): **A** is present but **not in position 3**.  
   - I(✓): **I** is **correctly placed in position 4**.  
   - T(-): **T** is present but **not in position 5**.  

3. **Guess 3 (ACTIN) Feedback**:  
   - A(✓): **A** is **correctly placed in position 1**.  
   - C(-): **C** is present but **not in position 2**.  
   - T(✓): **T** is **correctly placed in position 3**.  
   - I(✓): **I** is **correctly placed in position 4** (already known).  
   - N(x): **N** is **not** in the word.  

### Consolidated Knowledge
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 1: **A**  
  - Position 3: **T**  
  - Position 4: **I**  
- **Confirmed absent letters**: **R**, **S**, **E**, **P**, **L**, **N**.  
- **Present letters with restrictions**:  
  - **C** is in the word but **not at position 2** (from Guess 3 feedback).  
  - **T** is not at position 5 (from Guess 2 feedback).  
- **Word structure**: `A _ T I _`  
  - Only positions 2 and 5 are unknown.  
- **Constraints for position 5**:  
  - Cannot be T (since T is not at position 5).  
  - Must be **C** (since C is present but not at position 2, and positions 1, 3, and 4 are already taken).  
- **Constraints for position 2**:  
  - Must not be an absent letter (**R, S, E, P, L, N**).  
  - Must form a valid English word with `A _ T I C`.  

### Deduction
- The only possible word fitting `A _ T I C` is **""ATTIC""**:  
  - **A**(1) **T**(2) **T**(3) **I**(4) **C**(5).  
- Why ""ATTIC""?  
  - It adheres to all constraints:  
    - Position 2 is **T** (not absent, and forms a valid word).  
    - Position 5 is **C** (resolving the `C(-)` feedback from Guess 3).  
    - All positions align with confirmed placements: A(1), T(3), I(4).  
  - Duplicate **T** is allowed and satisfies feedback:  
    - T must be present (from Guess 2), and its position at 3 is correct (✓ in Guess 3).  
    - The second T at position 2 is consistent with no conflicting feedback.  
- No other words fit:  
  - Alternatives like ""ARTIC"" (R disallowed) or ""ANTIC"" (N disallowed) are invalid.  

### Next Guess  
Given the deductions, **""ATTIC""** is the only logical candidate. If correct, we win; if not, feedback will help identify discrepancies (e.g., if duplication is invalid).

<guess>ATTIC</guess>",ATTIC,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

1. Guess 1: RAISE -> R(x) A(-) I(-) S(x) E(x)
   - Absent letters: R, S, E
   - A is in the word but not in position 2
   - I is in the word but not in position 3

2. Guess 2: PLAIT -> P(x) L(x) A(-) I(✓) T(-)
   - Absent letters: P, L (added to R, S, E)
   - A is in the word but not in position 3
   - I is correct in position 4
   - T is in the word but not in position 5

3. Guess 3: ACTIN -> A(✓) C(-) T(✓) I(✓) N(x)
   - A is correct in position 1
   - C is in the word but not in position 2
   - T is correct in position 3
   - I is correct in position 4 (already known)
   - N is not in the word, so N is absent

Now, summary of known information:

- Correct positions:
  - Position 1: A (from Guess 3)
  - Position 3: T (from Guess 3)
  - Position 4: I (from Guess 2)

- Incorrect positions for letters:
  - C is somewhere in the word, but not in position 2 (so must be in position 2 or 5? Wait, positions: only position 5 is left? But hold on...)

The word structure: A _ T I _
Positions: 1: A, 2: ?, 3: T, 4: I, 5: ?

We also know:
- Absent letters: R, S, E, P, L, N
- Present letters (not yet placed): C (known from Guess 3 feedback: C(-) means C is in the word but not in position 2)

Therefore, since position 2 is not C, and the only unknown positions are 2 and 5, C must be in position 5? Or could it be elsewhere? But we have positions:
- Pos 1: A (fixed)
- Pos 2: unknown
- Pos 3: T (fixed)
- Pos 4: I (fixed)
- Pos 5: unknown

Present letters: we know C is in the word (and only two unknown positions: 2 and 5). So C must be in position 5? Or it could be in position 2? Wait, no: in Guess 3, we guessed C in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning C is in the word but not in position 2. Therefore, C cannot be in position 2. So C must be in position 5? Because that's the only other position? Yes.

But note: could there be duplicate letters? We don't have any indication of duplicates so far. But we must consider? We don't know.

Therefore, we can deduce:
- Position 5 must be C? But let's confirm:

The word is A, _, T, I, _ 
We know the fifth letter must be C because:
- C is present (from feedback) and absent at position 2, so must be at position 5? Since position 1, 3, and 4 are taken by A, T, I respectively. So position 2 and 5: C cannot be at position 2, so it must be at position 5? Therefore, position 5 is C.

But then position 2 must be some other letter? But wait: we have only five positions. All letters? We have A, T, I, C, and the letter in position 2? We know C is in the word? But we also have a letter for position 2? And we don't have duplicates? So the word should be: A _ T I C, but we need to find the letter at position 2.

But from Guess 3: we have N absent? And other absent letters? But we don't know what position 2 is.

Moreover, we know C is present? And we placed it at position 5? But in our guess 3 (ACTIN) we placed N at position 5? And we got N(x)? So position 5 cannot be N? But we haven't guessed C at position 5? We placed C at 2? Not 5.

But now, we know C must be somewhere? And the only possibility is position 5? Because position 2 is not C? And other positions are fixed? So the word is A, ?, T, I, C? For position 5? And the missing letter is position 2.

We also know that position 5 must be a letter that hasn't been excluded? What about the letter at position 2? We need to find one letter that completes the word? But we have constraints:

- The word must include C (which we now place at position 5?).
- And the letter in position 2 must be a letter not in the absent list? Not R,S,E,P,L,N? And must be present? We haven't guessed position 2 yet? Actually, we haven't tested the letter at position 2 explicitly? Except that in Guess 3, we tried C there? So we tested a letter? Only at position 2? We tried C? But not other letters? So position 2 is unknown? But we must find a letter for it? And it must be in the word? Or could it be absent? We don't know? Because the secret word could be any valid word? But we know all letters? Let's see.

We have five letters: A at 1, T at 3, I at 4, and C must be somewhere? And we know C is not at 2? So only position 5? Therefore, position 5 is C? Then the word is: A ? T I C

Position 2 must be filled with some letter? That letter must:
- Not be in the absent list: R, S, E, P, L, N
- Be present? How do we know? We don't have feedback about it? But we know the word must have five letters? So position 2 must have a letter? And if we know that C is at 5? And A,T,I are at 1,3,4? Then position 2 must be some other letter? If that letter hasn't been guessed? Then it could be almost anything? But we have to consider duplicates? But we don't have duplicates? But we haven't tested? So let's assume no duplicates? Then the letter at position 2 is another letter.

We also note that in Guess 3, we got C(-), meaning C is in the word? But not at position 2? So yes? And C must be in one of the other positions? But position 1,3,4 are taken by A,T,I? So only position 5? So C must be at position 5? Therefore, the word is: A + [letter at position 2] + T + I + C

We need to find the letter for position 2? But we don't have any additional information? We must avoid the absent letters? So find a letter that is:
- Not R, S, E, P, L, N
- And must form a valid word: ""A?TIC"" 

Possible words: The pattern is A_TIC? We need English words that fit: A?TIC? 

Common letters: 
- Possible: ACTIC? But what? Actually, we have A?TIC? So the missing letter at position 2? 

The only word that matches this pattern? We know C is at position 5? So the word ends in ""TIC"". So ""A_TIC"" words? 

Examples: 
- ATTIC? But we have T at position 3? And I at 4? C at 5? But position 2? So A+T+TIC? But then we have two T's? Also, the word ""ATTIC"": A(1), T(2), T(3), I(4), C(5). But note: we have T both at position 2 and position 3? But we got T(✓) at position 3? And T was known to be present? But if we put T at position 2? Then that T? In guess 3, we guessed ACTIN? We didn't guess T at position 2? So we don't know?

But let's see the constraints: 
- In Guess 3, we guessed ACTIN: A C T I N? And got C(-)? Which says C is present but not position 2? 
- We also got N(x)? So N absent?
- And T(✓) at position 3? So T is at position 3? Therefore, the secret word has T only at position 3? Or possibly multiple? But if we consider ""ATTIC""? The secret word could be ""ATTIC""? Then it would have T at position 2 and 3? 

However, check Guess 2: PLAIT? We guessed T at position 5? And got '-'? Meaning T is in the word? But not at position 5? Which is consistent? And T was not excluded? So ""ATTIC"" is possible? Because T is at both position 2 and 3? 

But let's verify the feedback consistency? 
For Guess 3, if the secret word is ""ATTIC"", and we guessed ""ACTIN""? 
- Position 1: A? Correct? So ✓
- Position 2: C? Secret has T? So C is not present? But we got C(-)? Which says C is present? But in ""ATTIC"", there is no C? Wait, ""ATTIC"" has C at position 5? Yes: A-T-T-I-C? So ""ATTIC""? Letters: A, T, T, I, C? So it has C? And we guessed C at position 2? But the secret word? Position 2 is T? Not C? So C is present (at position 5)? But we guessed? 

In the feedback system? We get letter-wise feedback? And for C? Even though we put C at position 2? But it is at position 5? So we get '-'? Meaning that C is in the word? But not at position 2? Which matches? 

Similarly, for the letter? We guessed: 
- Position 1: A? ✓
- Position 2: C? → '-' because C is present but in wrong position? Since it was actually at position 5? 
- Position 3: T? Secret has T at position 3? So ✓
- Position 4: I? ✓
- Position 5: N? Secret has C? Not N? So N(x)? Which matches? 

So ""ATTIC"" fits? But wait: the secret word ""ATTIC"" has position 2? T? But we have T at position 3? And there's also another T? 

But let's see: does it violate any previous feedback?
- Guess 1: RAISE? 
  - R(x): not in word? Correct? 
  - A(-): A is present? At position 1? Why marked wrong? Wait, in RAISE? We had: R A I S E? Position? Position 1: R? Absent? Position 2: A? Secret word ""ATTIC"" has A at position 1? But we guessed at position 2? So A is present? But in wrong position? So '-'? 
  - I(-): I is at position 4? Secret? At position 4? But we guessed at position 3? So I is present? Not at position 3? So '-'? 
  - S(x)? Correct? 
  - E(x)? Correct? 

Guess 2: PLAIT? 
  - P(x)? Correct? 
  - L(x)? 
  - A(-): We guessed A at position 3? Secret? Position 1? So A is present? Not at position 3? So '-'? 
  - I(✓): Position 4? Correct? 
  - T(-): We guessed T at position 5? Secret: T at positions 2 and 3? But position 5? No? So T is in word? But not at position 5? So '-'? And it doesn't specify that one of the T's is matched? So it's okay? 

So ""ATTIC"" fits? 

But wait? Is ""ATTIC"" acceptable? Yes? 

Therefore? The secret word might be ""ATTIC""? But we are asked to guess? So we can guess ""ATTIC""? 

But why didn't we think about it before? 

But we got N(x) meaning N is absent? So the fifth letter? We thought C? But in ATTIC? Position 5 is C? And position 2 is T? Which we have? 

But we must consider: is there any other word? 

Another word: ARTIC? But A is fixed? But ARTIC? A, R? But R is absent? Cannot? Because R is excluded? 

Or? ""AFTIC""? Not a word? 

""ALTIC""? L excluded? 

""APTIC""? P excluded? 

So possible words: only ""ATTIC""? 

But what about ""ATTIC"" vs ""ANTIC""? But N is absent? In ""ANTIC""? We have N? But we got N(x)? So ""ANTIC"" cannot be? Because it would have N at position 5? But we know N is absent? So only ""ATTIC""? 

But how about duplicate letters? Are there other words? 

For example? ""AFRIC"" but F? And R? R,S,E excluded? 

No? So I think ""ATTIC"" is the only possibility? 

Then we should guess ""ATTIC""? 

But let me confirm the pattern? ""ATTIC"": 

Position: A(1), T(2), T(3), I(4), C(5)? 

But earlier we deduced that position 5 is C? And position 3 is T? Fixed? And position 2? We didn't know? But ""ATTIC"" has T at position 2? 

And T? We know from Guess 3 that T is at position 3? But we didn't know? That? But we guessed T at position 3? And got ✓? So T is at position 3? So in ""ATTIC""? Position 3 has T? Correct? And position 2? Also T? But that is allowed? 

And we also have C at position 5? 

So yes? 

Therefore? We can guess ""ATTIC""? 

But note: in Guess 3? We have not tested position 2? So it could be T? Or other? But the letter must not be excluded? And must result in a word? 

Given the constraints? ""ATTIC"" seems to be the only word that fits? 

So let's guess ""ATTIC""? 

But note: we are allowed to guess words with duplicate letters? So that's fine? 

Therefore? for the fourth guess? ATTIC? 

But wait? We are on the fourth guess? We might not need to? But given the information? 

Alternative? We can think: we know position 2 must be a letter that we haven't excluded? And form ""A_TIC"" words? 

Possible words ending in TIC? And start with A? 

- ATTIC? 
- ARTIC? excluded? (R) 
- ANTIC? excluded? (N) 
- AOTIC? Not a word? 
- ACTIC? ACTIC: A C T I C? But we know from Guess 3 that C is not in position 2? So if the word is ""ACTIC"": A(1), C(2), T(3), I(4), C(5). But we guessed C at position 2? And got '-'? Meaning C is present but not at position 2? But if the word has C at position 2? It would be marked ✓? But we got '-'? So secret word cannot have C at position 2? Therefore ""ACTIC"" would only be allowed if C is not at position 2? But in ""ACTIC"", position 2 is C? Then we would have got ✓ for position 2? But we got '-'? So ""ACTIC"" cannot be? 

So only ""ATTIC"" fits? 

But what about other words? 

Like ""ABTIC""? Not a word? 

Thus? ""ATTIC"" is the only possibility? 

Therefore? we guess ""ATTIC""? 

So final answer? <guess>ATTIC</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback
Here's a step-by-step breakdown based on all feedback provided:

1. **Guess 1 (RAISE) Feedback**:  
   - R(x), S(x), E(x): Letters **R**, **S**, **E** are **not** in the word.  
   - A(-): **A** is present but **not in position 2**.  
   - I(-): **I** is present but **not in position 3**.  

2. **Guess 2 (PLAIT) Feedback**:  
   - P(x), L(x): **P** and **L** are **not** in the word.  
   - A(-): **A** is present but **not in position 3**.  
   - I(✓): **I** is **correctly placed in position 4**.  
   - T(-): **T** is present but **not in position 5**.  

3. **Guess 3 (ACTIN) Feedback**:  
   - A(✓): **A** is **correctly placed in position 1**.  
   - C(-): **C** is present but **not in position 2**.  
   - T(✓): **T** is **correctly placed in position 3**.  
   - I(✓): **I** is **correctly placed in position 4** (already known).  
   - N(x): **N** is **not** in the word.  

### Consolidated Knowledge
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 1: **A**  
  - Position 3: **T**  
  - Position 4: **I**  
- **Confirmed absent letters**: **R**, **S**, **E**, **P**, **L**, **N**.  
- **Present letters with restrictions**:  
  - **C** is in the word but **not at position 2** (from Guess 3 feedback).  
  - **T** is not at position 5 (from Guess 2 feedback).  
- **Word structure**: `A _ T I _`  
  - Only positions 2 and 5 are unknown.  
- **Constraints for position 5**:  
  - Cannot be T (since T is not at position 5).  
  - Must be **C** (since C is present but not at position 2, and positions 1, 3, and 4 are already taken).  
- **Constraints for position 2**:  
  - Must not be an absent letter (**R, S, E, P, L, N**).  
  - Must form a valid English word with `A _ T I C`.  

### Deduction
- The only possible word fitting `A _ T I C` is **""ATTIC""**:  
  - **A**(1) **T**(2) **T**(3) **I**(4) **C**(5).  
- Why ""ATTIC""?  
  - It adheres to all constraints:  
    - Position 2 is **T** (not absent, and forms a valid word).  
    - Position 5 is **C** (resolving the `C(-)` feedback from Guess 3).  
    - All positions align with confirmed placements: A(1), T(3), I(4).  
  - Duplicate **T** is allowed and satisfies feedback:  
    - T must be present (from Guess 2), and its position at 3 is correct (✓ in Guess 3).  
    - The second T at position 2 is consistent with no conflicting feedback.  
- No other words fit:  
  - Alternatives like ""ARTIC"" (R disallowed) or ""ANTIC"" (N disallowed) are invalid.  

### Next Guess  
Given the deductions, **""ATTIC""** is the only logical candidate. If correct, we win; if not, feedback will help identify discrepancies (e.g., if duplication is invalid).",Guess 4: ATTIC -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) T(✓) T(✓) I(✓) C(✓),SUCCESS
