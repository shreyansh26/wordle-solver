We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
 This tells us:
   - A and N are in the secret word and in the correct positions. Specifically, A is the 3rd letter and N is the 4th letter (since ""crane"" is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).
   - The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A N _

 We know the word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.

 We also know that the letters C, R, and E are absent.

 For our next guess, we need to:
   - Keep A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.
   - Avoid using any of the letters C, R, E.

 We also want to test new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

 Since A and N are fixed, the word is ? ? A N ?

 We don't know the 1st, 2nd, and 5th letters, and they must be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, E.

 Common letters we might try: we can try words that have other vowels and common consonants.

 What words fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and do not contain C, R, E?
 Let's think of possible words: 
   - We might consider ""urban"": U in 1st, R in 2nd? But wait, R is in the feedback as not present (x). So we must avoid R. So ""urban"" is invalid because it contains R.
   - ""man"" at the end? Words like ""laugh"" but no, because the pattern is fixed at A in 3rd and N in 4th.

 Actually, the pattern must have the 3rd letter A and 4th letter N, so:
   ... A N ...

 Words: 
   - plain? p l A i n -> but n is already the 4th? wait, ""plain"" has ""a"" at position 3? Let's see: positions: 1:p, 2:l, 3:a, 4:i, 5:n -> that doesn't match because we need N at position 4, but ""plain"" has i at 4 and n at 5.

 We need exactly: position1=?, position2=?, position3=A, position4=N, position5=?

 So the word ends with the 4th letter as N? Not necessarily, because we have one more letter after N? Actually, no: we have A at 3 and N at 4. Then there is the 5th letter.

 Example words: 
   - ""train"": t at1, r at2 -> but R is excluded, so no.
   - ""chain"": c at1 -> C is excluded, so no.
   - ""again"": a at1 -> but we can try? But note: we have to avoid using E, R, C? And ""again"" has A at 1 which we don't know if it's allowed? Actually, we can have A as the first letter? But note that we have no information about A in the first position? However, we already have an A at position 3, so if there is another A, that's possible? But the feedback did not indicate two A's. However, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters explicitly? 

 But note the feedback rules: 
   - In feedback, if a letter appears multiple times, it can be tricky. However, in this case, the first guess ""crane"" only had one A and it was in the correct position. So if the word has two A's, the other A might be marked as absent or present? Actually, the feedback would show the occurrence only if it exists? 

 Let me clarify: 
   - The secret word is BRISK. We guessed ""crane"": 
        C is not in BRISK -> x
        R is in BRISK? Actually, BRISK has R at the second position? But in ""crane"", R is at the second position. However, the secret word BRISK has R at position 2? Then why was R marked as (x)? ... Wait, let's look back at the example.

 Wait, the example in the initial instructions used BRISK and STORM: 
   STORM: S(-) because S is in the word but not at position 1 (since secret has S at position 4?).

 But in our feedback for ""crane"": 
   C was absent -> correct because BRISK doesn't have C.
   R: in ""crane"" is at position 2. The secret BRISK has R at position 2? Then why is R(x) in the feedback? 

 Actually, wait we are not solving ""BRISK"", we are solving a new word. The example was just an example. So let's not confuse.

 We have feedback for ""crane"": 
   C(x) -> not in word.
   R(x) -> not in word? So the secret word does not contain R at all?
   A(✓) -> in the word and in position 3.
   N(✓) -> in the word and in position 4.
   E(x) -> not in word.

 Therefore, the secret word has no R, no C, no E.

 Now, coming back to our pattern: _ _ A N _

 We must choose a word that:
   - Has the form: [any letter except C,R,E] [any letter except C,R,E] A N [any letter except C,R,E]

 Let's think of words ending with ""AN"" but note the pattern is fixed: 3rd letter A, 4th letter N.

 So the word must be: ? + ? + A + N + ?

 Possibilities: 
   - The first letter: any consonant or vowel except C,R,E.
   - The second letter: similarly.
   - The fifth letter: similarly.

 Some words that fit: 
   - ""stand"": s(t) a(n) d -> wait: 
        s at position1, t at position2, then position3 is a? Actually, ""stand"": s (1), t (2), a (3), n (4), d (5). 
        And stand: letters: s, t, a, n, d -> none of C,R,E. So it's valid.
   - ""handy"": h(1), a(2) -> wait, no: because position3 must be A? But ""handy"": h, a, n, d, y -> positions: 1:h, 2:a, 3:n -> doesn't have A at 3 and N at 4? So not matching.

 Also, ""panic"": p a n i c -> positions: 1:p, 2:a, 3:n -> so the a is at position2 and n at position3? Not A at position3 and N at position4.

 We need: 
   position1: ?
   position2: ?
   position3: A
   position4: N
   position5: ?

 So words like:
   - ""ocean"": o c e a n -> But we have a at position4? Wait: 
        o (1), c (2), e (3), a (4), n (5) -> pattern A at 4? Not at 3. So no.

 How about ""plain""? As I thought earlier: 
   p (1), l (2), a (3), i (4), n (5) -> but wait, position4 is i, not N? And position5 is n? That's not matching because we need position4 to be N.

 We need position4 to be N. So the pattern must have ...A as the third letter and N as the fourth? Then fifth letter is free.

 Valid words:
   - ""urban"": u(1), r(2), b(3)? Wait: urban: u (1), r (2), b (3), a (4), n (5)? No. That's not matching.

 Actually:

   We need: 
      letter3: A
      letter4: N

 So the word must be: 
      [1] [2] A N [5]

 So: 
      stand: s(1) t(2) a(3) n(4) d(5) -> valid.
      mania? m a n i a -> no: because positions: m(1), a(2), n(3), i(4), a(5) -> doesn't have A at 3? It has n at 3.

 How about ""vanish"": but vanish is 6 letters? No, 6 letters? ""vanish"" is 5? 
      v a n i s h -> that's 6? Actually, 5: v,a,n,i,sh? Wait, no: vanish is 5 letters? v,a,n,i,sh? 
      Actually: V-A-N-I-S-H -> 6 letters? So let's stick to 5.

 Let me list 5-letter words that have A as the third and N as the fourth letter:
   - ""stand"": s t a n d
   - ""thank"": t h a n k
   - ""stank"": s t a n k
   - ""black""? b l a c k -> but c is excluded? But we'll avoid C anyway? Oh, C is excluded? The feedback says C(x) -> so we cannot use C? 
        But ""black"" has C? So skip.
   - ""clank""? Now, C and also we don't know if L is allowed? But we already know C is excluded? So invalid.

 What about ""bland"": b l a n d -> But we haven't tested B and L? And D is also not known.

 However, we also need to test new letters? So let's choose a word that gives us more information? We don't have information on the vowels? Or consonants? 

 We know A and N are fixed. So we must fill in positions 1,2,5.

 Since we have three positions to figure out, and we have 4 remaining guesses? Actually, we are at the second guess.

 We can choose a word that uses common letters for positions 1,2,5.

 Common letters to test: maybe S, T, L, D, K, etc.

 But note: we want to avoid C, R, E.

 Let me consider ""stand"": it has S, T, D? Also, if we guess ""stand"", we test S at position1, T at position2, and D at position5.

 Alternatively, ""thank"" would test T, H, K.

 Another option: ""dance""? But ""dance"": 
      d(1), a(2), n(3) -> wait, that doesn't match because we need A at position3? 
      ""dance"": D at1, a at2, n at position3? Then what about the rest? We need A at position3? 
      And our pattern is: _ _ A N _ -> so position2 is not A? 

 So ""dance"" would not work because position3 is n? Actually:
      d a n c e -> pattern: 
        position3: n -> not A? And position4: c? Not N? 

 So we cannot use ""dance"" because it doesn't have A at position3 and N at position4? We must have A at 3 and N at 4.

 Back to possibilities: 
   - ""stand"": s t a n d -> good.
   - ""thank"": t h a n k -> good.
   - ""stank"": s t a n k -> good.
   - ""shank"": s h a n k -> good.
   - ""swank"": s w a n k -> good.
   - ""brand"": but b r a n d -> contains r? R is excluded? So no.

 We also have ""plain""? No, because plain has pattern: p l a i n -> which is p(1), l(2), a(3), i(4), n(5) -> but we need n at position4? Here position4 is i -> not matching.

 We need exactly: ...A N at positions 3 and 4.

 So the pattern is: ??AN?

 We'll choose one that helps test common letters? 

 Let's choose ""stand"". It has S, T, D? We haven't tested S, T, D? And we know A and N are already fixed.

 But note: in the pattern, the A and N are fixed, so we are testing the first two letters and the last.

 However, if we guess ""stand"", we might get:

   If the secret word is ""stand"": all correct? We don't know.

   If the secret word has S at 1? Or not? We can learn.

 Alternatively, maybe we choose a word that doesn't repeat letters we already know? We know A and N are present? But we are forced to put them in positions 3 and 4? So we are testing the other positions.

 But we must include A and N at those positions? So we are stuck? 

 However, note: we have to use only valid words. 

 Another idea: we can test other vowels or common consonants? 

 Let me try to list common letters we haven't tested: 
   We tried C,R,A,N,E -> so A and N are known. C, R, E are out.

   We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can choose a word that uses multiple new common letters? 

 The most common letters in English are E (we know absent), T, A (known), O, I, N (known), S, H, R (absent), D, L, U.

 So of the top, we can test T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

 We can try to cover as many of these as possible? But we have only three positions: 1, 2, and 5.

 ""thank"": has T, H, K? K is less common.

 ""stand"": has S, T, D? S is common, T is common, D is common? 

 How about ""stond""? Not a word? 

 How about ""stonk""? Not a word.

 How about ""sting""? But ""sting"": s t i n g -> pattern: 
      position1: s, position2: t, position3: i? -> not A? So we must have A at position3? So ""sting"" doesn't have A at position3? So it's invalid.

 Therefore, I think ""stand"" is a good candidate? 

 But wait, we don't know for sure? Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have A and N? But we must because they are fixed? We have to include A at position3 and N at position4? So we must.

 Therefore, I choose ""stand"". 

 Let's write: 
   <guess>stand</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓)  
- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓)  
- C, R, and E are absent (x)  

The secret word must have the pattern `_ _ A N _`, where the first, second, and fifth letters are *not* C, R, or E.  

For the next guess, I prioritized **testing common unused letters** (like S, T, and D) while maintaining the confirmed A (3rd) and N (4th) positions. Selecting ""stand"" allows us to:  
- Test S at position 1  
- Test T at position 2  
- Test D at position 5  

This helps probe multiple untested common consonants efficiently.  

<guess>stand</guess>",stand,"We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
 This tells us:
   - A and N are in the secret word and in the correct positions. Specifically, A is the 3rd letter and N is the 4th letter (since ""crane"" is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).
   - The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A N _

 We know the word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.

 We also know that the letters C, R, and E are absent.

 For our next guess, we need to:
   - Keep A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.
   - Avoid using any of the letters C, R, E.

 We also want to test new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

 We don't know the 1st, 2nd, and 5th letters, and they must be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, E.

 Common letters we might try: we can try words that have other vowels and common consonants.

 What words fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and do not contain C, R, E?

   - ""man"" at the end? Words like ""laugh"" but no, because the pattern is fixed at A in 3rd and N in 4th.

 Actually, the pattern must have the 3rd letter A and 4th letter N, so:
   ... A N ...

 Words: 
   - plain? p l A i n -> but n is already the 4th? wait, ""plain"" has ""a"" at position 3? Let's see: positions: 1:p, 2:l, 3:a, 4:i, 5:n -> that doesn't match because we need N at position 4, but ""plain"" has i at 4 and n at 5.

 We need exactly: position1=?, position2=?, position3=A, position4=N, position5=?

 So the word ends with the 4th letter as N? Not necessarily, because we have one more letter after N? Actually, no: we have A at 3 and N at 4. Then there is the 5th letter.

 Example words: 
   - ""train"": t at1, r at2 -> but R is excluded, so no.
   - ""chain"": c at1 -> C is excluded, so no.
   - ""again"": a at1 -> but we can try? But note: we have to avoid using E, R, C? And ""again"" has A at 1 which we don't know if it's allowed? Actually, we can have A as the first letter?

So if the word has two A's, the other A might be marked as absent or present? Actually, the feedback would show the occurrence only if it exists? 

 Let me clarify: 
   - The secret word is BRISK. We guessed ""crane"": 
        C is not in BRISK -> x
        R is in BRISK? Actually, BRISK has R at the second position? But in ""crane"", R is at the second position. However, the secret word BRISK has R at position 2? Then why was R marked as (x)? ... Wait, let's look back at the example.

 Wait, the example in the initial instructions used BRISK and STORM: 
   STORM: S(-) because S is in the word but not at position 1 (since secret has S at position 4?).

 But in our feedback for ""crane"": 
   C was absent -> correct because BRISK doesn't have C.
   R: in ""crane"" is at position 2. The secret BRISK has R at position 2? Then why is R(x) in the feedback? 

 Actually, wait we are not solving ""BRISK"", we are solving a new word. The example was just an example. So let's not confuse.

 We have feedback for ""crane"": 
   C(x) -> not in word.
   R(x) -> not in word? So the secret word does not contain R at all?
   A(✓) -> in the word and in position 3.
   N(✓) -> in the word and in position 4.
   E(x) -> not in word.

 Therefore, the secret word has no R, no C, no E.

 Now, coming back to our pattern: _ _ A N _

 We must choose a word that:
   - Has the form: [any letter except C,R,E] [any letter except C,R,E] A N [any letter except C,R,E]

 Let's think of words ending with ""AN"" but note the pattern is fixed: 3rd letter A, 4th letter N.

 So the word must be: ? + ? + A + N + ?

 Possibilities: 
   - The first letter: any consonant or vowel except C,R,E.
   - The second letter: similarly.
   - The fifth letter: similarly.

 Some words that fit: 
   - ""stand"": s(t) a(n) d -> wait: 
        s at position1, t at position2, then position3 is a? Actually, ""stand"": s (1), t (2), a (3), n (4), d (5). 
        And stand: letters: s, t, a, n, d -> none of C,R,E. So it's valid.
   - ""handy"": h(1), a(2) -> wait, no: because position3 must be A? But ""handy"": h, a, n, d, y -> positions: 1:h, 2:a, 3:n -> doesn't have A at 3 and N at 4? So not matching.

 Also, ""panic"": p a n i c -> positions: 1:p, 2:a, 3:n -> so the a is at position2 and n at position3? Not A at position3 and N at position4.

 We need: 
   position1: ?
   position2: ?
   position3: A
   position4: N
   position5: ?

 So words like:
   - ""ocean"": o c e a n -> But we have a at position4? Wait: 
        o (1), c (2), e (3), a (4), n (5) -> pattern A at 4? Not at 3. So no.

 How about ""plain""? As I thought earlier: 
   p (1), l (2), a (3), i (4), n (5) -> but wait, position4 is i, not N? And position5 is n? That's not matching because we need position4 to be N.

 We need position4 to be N. So the pattern must have ...A as the third letter and N as the fourth? Then fifth letter is free.

 Valid words:
   - ""urban"": u(1), r(2), b(3)? Wait: urban: u (1), r (2), b (3), a (4), n (5)? No. That's not matching.

 Actually:

   We need: 
      letter3: A
      letter4: N

 So the word must be: 
      [1] [2] A N [5]

 So: 
      stand: s(1) t(2) a(3) n(4) d(5) -> valid.
      mania? m a n i a -> no: because positions: m(1), a(2), n(3), i(4), a(5) -> doesn't have A at 3? It has n at 3.

 How about ""vanish"": but vanish is 6 letters? No, 6 letters? ""vanish"" is 5? 
      v a n i s h -> that's 6? Actually, 5: v,a,n,i,sh? Wait, no: vanish is 5 letters? v,a,n,i,sh? 
      Actually: V-A-N-I-S-H -> 6 letters? So let's stick to 5.

 Let me list 5-letter words that have A as the third and N as the fourth letter:
   - ""stand"": s t a n d
   - ""thank"": t h a n k
   - ""stank"": s t a n k
   - ""black""? b l a c k -> but c is excluded? But we'll avoid C anyway? Oh, C is excluded? The feedback says C(x) -> so we cannot use C? 
        But ""black"" has C? So skip.
   - ""clank""? Now, C and also we don't know if L is allowed? But we already know C is excluded? So invalid.

 What about ""bland"": b l a n d -> But we haven't tested B and L? And D is also not known.

 However, we also need to test new letters? So let's choose a word that gives us more information? We don't have information on the vowels? Or consonants? 

 We know A and N are fixed. So we must fill in positions 1,2,5.

 Since we have three positions to figure out, and we have 4 remaining guesses? Actually, we are at the second guess.

 We can choose a word that uses common letters for positions 1,2,5.

 Common letters to test: maybe S, T, L, D, K, etc.

 But note: we want to avoid C, R, E.

 Let me consider ""stand"": it has S, T, D? Also, if we guess ""stand"", we test S at position1, T at position2, and D at position5.

 Alternatively, ""thank"" would test T, H, K.

 Another option: ""dance""? But ""dance"": 
      d(1), a(2), n(3) -> wait, that doesn't match because we need A at position3? 
      ""dance"": D at1, a at2, n at position3? Then what about the rest? We need A at position3? 
      And our pattern is: _ _ A N _ -> so position2 is not A? 

 So ""dance"" would not work because position3 is n? Actually:
      d a n c e -> pattern: 
        position3: n -> not A? And position4: c? Not N? 

 So we cannot use ""dance"" because it doesn't have A at position3 and N at position4? We must have A at 3 and N at 4.

 Back to possibilities: 
   - ""stand"": s t a n d -> good.
   - ""thank"": t h a n k -> good.
   - ""stank"": s t a n k -> good.
   - ""shank"": s h a n k -> good.
   - ""swank"": s w a n k -> good.
   - ""brand"": but b r a n d -> contains r? R is excluded? So no.

 We also have ""plain""? No, because plain has pattern: p l a i n -> which is p(1), l(2), a(3), i(4), n(5) -> but we need n at position4? Here position4 is i -> not matching.

 We need exactly: ...A N at positions 3 and 4.

 So the pattern is: ??AN?

 We'll choose one that helps test common letters? 

 Let's choose ""stand"". It has S, T, D? We haven't tested S, T, D? And we know A and N are already fixed.

 But note: in the pattern, the A and N are fixed, so we are testing the first two letters and the last.

 However, if we guess ""stand"", we might get:

   If the secret word is ""stand"": all correct? We don't know.

   If the secret word has S at 1? Or not? We can learn.

 Alternatively, maybe we choose a word that doesn't repeat letters we already know? We know A and N are present? But we are forced to put them in positions 3 and 4? So we are testing the other positions.

 But we must include A and N at those positions? So we are stuck? 

 However, note: we have to use only valid words. 

 Another idea: we can test other vowels or common consonants? 

 Let me try to list common letters we haven't tested: 
   We tried C,R,A,N,E -> so A and N are known. C, R, E are out.

   We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can choose a word that uses multiple new common letters? 

 The most common letters in English are E (we know absent), T, A (known), O, I, N (known), S, H, R (absent), D, L, U.

 So of the top, we can test T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

 We can try to cover as many of these as possible? But we have only three positions: 1, 2, and 5.

 ""thank"": has T, H, K? K is less common.

 ""stand"": has S, T, D? S is common, T is common, D is common? 

 How about ""stond""? Not a word? 

 How about ""stonk""? Not a word.

 How about ""sting""? But ""sting"": s t i n g -> pattern: 
      position1: s, position2: t, position3: i? -> not A? So we must have A at position3? So ""sting"" doesn't have A at position3? So it's invalid.

 Therefore, I think ""stand"" is a good candidate? 

 But wait, we don't know for sure? Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have A and N? But we must because they are fixed? We have to include A at position3 and N at position4? So we must.

 Therefore, I choose ""stand"". 

 Let's write: 
   <guess>stand</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓)  
- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓)  
- C, R, and E are absent (x)  

The secret word must have the pattern `_ _ A N _`, where the first, second, and fifth letters are *not* C, R, or E.  

For the next guess, I prioritized **testing common unused letters** (like S, T, and D) while maintaining the confirmed A (3rd) and N (4th) positions. Selecting ""stand"" allows us to:  
- Test S at position 1  
- Test T at position 2  
- Test D at position 5  

This helps probe multiple untested common consonants efficiently.",Guess 2: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,PLANK,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
 This tells us:
   - A and N are in the secret word and in the correct positions. Specifically, A is the 3rd letter and N is the 4th letter (since ""crane"" is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).
   - The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A N _

 We know the word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.

 We also know that the letters C, R, and E are absent.

 For our next guess, we need to:
   - Keep A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.
   - Avoid using any of the letters C, R, E.

 We also want to test new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

 Since A and N are fixed, the word is ? ? A N ?

 We don't know the 1st, 2nd, and 5th letters, and they must be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, E.

 Common letters we might try: we can try words that have other vowels and common consonants.

 What words fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and do not contain C, R, E?
 Let's think of possible words: 
   - We might consider ""urban"": U in 1st, R in 2nd? But wait, R is in the feedback as not present (x). So we must avoid R. So ""urban"" is invalid because it contains R.
   - ""man"" at the end? Words like ""laugh"" but no, because the pattern is fixed at A in 3rd and N in 4th.

 Actually, the pattern must have the 3rd letter A and 4th letter N, so:
   ... A N ...

 Words: 
   - plain? p l A i n -> but n is already the 4th? wait, ""plain"" has ""a"" at position 3? Let's see: positions: 1:p, 2:l, 3:a, 4:i, 5:n -> that doesn't match because we need N at position 4, but ""plain"" has i at 4 and n at 5.

 We need exactly: position1=?, position2=?, position3=A, position4=N, position5=?

 So the word ends with the 4th letter as N? Not necessarily, because we have one more letter after N? Actually, no: we have A at 3 and N at 4. Then there is the 5th letter.

 Example words: 
   - ""train"": t at1, r at2 -> but R is excluded, so no.
   - ""chain"": c at1 -> C is excluded, so no.
   - ""again"": a at1 -> but we can try? But note: we have to avoid using E, R, C? And ""again"" has A at 1 which we don't know if it's allowed? Actually, we can have A as the first letter? But note that we have no information about A in the first position? However, we already have an A at position 3, so if there is another A, that's possible? But the feedback did not indicate two A's. However, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters explicitly? 

 But note the feedback rules: 
   - In feedback, if a letter appears multiple times, it can be tricky. However, in this case, the first guess ""crane"" only had one A and it was in the correct position. So if the word has two A's, the other A might be marked as absent or present? Actually, the feedback would show the occurrence only if it exists? 

 Let me clarify: 
   - The secret word is BRISK. We guessed ""crane"": 
        C is not in BRISK -> x
        R is in BRISK? Actually, BRISK has R at the second position? But in ""crane"", R is at the second position. However, the secret word BRISK has R at position 2? Then why was R marked as (x)? ... Wait, let's look back at the example.

 Wait, the example in the initial instructions used BRISK and STORM: 
   STORM: S(-) because S is in the word but not at position 1 (since secret has S at position 4?).

 But in our feedback for ""crane"": 
   C was absent -> correct because BRISK doesn't have C.
   R: in ""crane"" is at position 2. The secret BRISK has R at position 2? Then why is R(x) in the feedback? 

 Actually, wait we are not solving ""BRISK"", we are solving a new word. The example was just an example. So let's not confuse.

 We have feedback for ""crane"": 
   C(x) -> not in word.
   R(x) -> not in word? So the secret word does not contain R at all?
   A(✓) -> in the word and in position 3.
   N(✓) -> in the word and in position 4.
   E(x) -> not in word.

 Therefore, the secret word has no R, no C, no E.

 Now, coming back to our pattern: _ _ A N _

 We must choose a word that:
   - Has the form: [any letter except C,R,E] [any letter except C,R,E] A N [any letter except C,R,E]

 Let's think of words ending with ""AN"" but note the pattern is fixed: 3rd letter A, 4th letter N.

 So the word must be: ? + ? + A + N + ?

 Possibilities: 
   - The first letter: any consonant or vowel except C,R,E.
   - The second letter: similarly.
   - The fifth letter: similarly.

 Some words that fit: 
   - ""stand"": s(t) a(n) d -> wait: 
        s at position1, t at position2, then position3 is a? Actually, ""stand"": s (1), t (2), a (3), n (4), d (5). 
        And stand: letters: s, t, a, n, d -> none of C,R,E. So it's valid.
   - ""handy"": h(1), a(2) -> wait, no: because position3 must be A? But ""handy"": h, a, n, d, y -> positions: 1:h, 2:a, 3:n -> doesn't have A at 3 and N at 4? So not matching.

 Also, ""panic"": p a n i c -> positions: 1:p, 2:a, 3:n -> so the a is at position2 and n at position3? Not A at position3 and N at position4.

 We need: 
   position1: ?
   position2: ?
   position3: A
   position4: N
   position5: ?

 So words like:
   - ""ocean"": o c e a n -> But we have a at position4? Wait: 
        o (1), c (2), e (3), a (4), n (5) -> pattern A at 4? Not at 3. So no.

 How about ""plain""? As I thought earlier: 
   p (1), l (2), a (3), i (4), n (5) -> but wait, position4 is i, not N? And position5 is n? That's not matching because we need position4 to be N.

 We need position4 to be N. So the pattern must have ...A as the third letter and N as the fourth? Then fifth letter is free.

 Valid words:
   - ""urban"": u(1), r(2), b(3)? Wait: urban: u (1), r (2), b (3), a (4), n (5)? No. That's not matching.

 Actually:

   We need: 
      letter3: A
      letter4: N

 So the word must be: 
      [1] [2] A N [5]

 So: 
      stand: s(1) t(2) a(3) n(4) d(5) -> valid.
      mania? m a n i a -> no: because positions: m(1), a(2), n(3), i(4), a(5) -> doesn't have A at 3? It has n at 3.

 How about ""vanish"": but vanish is 6 letters? No, 6 letters? ""vanish"" is 5? 
      v a n i s h -> that's 6? Actually, 5: v,a,n,i,sh? Wait, no: vanish is 5 letters? v,a,n,i,sh? 
      Actually: V-A-N-I-S-H -> 6 letters? So let's stick to 5.

 Let me list 5-letter words that have A as the third and N as the fourth letter:
   - ""stand"": s t a n d
   - ""thank"": t h a n k
   - ""stank"": s t a n k
   - ""black""? b l a c k -> but c is excluded? But we'll avoid C anyway? Oh, C is excluded? The feedback says C(x) -> so we cannot use C? 
        But ""black"" has C? So skip.
   - ""clank""? Now, C and also we don't know if L is allowed? But we already know C is excluded? So invalid.

 What about ""bland"": b l a n d -> But we haven't tested B and L? And D is also not known.

 However, we also need to test new letters? So let's choose a word that gives us more information? We don't have information on the vowels? Or consonants? 

 We know A and N are fixed. So we must fill in positions 1,2,5.

 Since we have three positions to figure out, and we have 4 remaining guesses? Actually, we are at the second guess.

 We can choose a word that uses common letters for positions 1,2,5.

 Common letters to test: maybe S, T, L, D, K, etc.

 But note: we want to avoid C, R, E.

 Let me consider ""stand"": it has S, T, D? Also, if we guess ""stand"", we test S at position1, T at position2, and D at position5.

 Alternatively, ""thank"" would test T, H, K.

 Another option: ""dance""? But ""dance"": 
      d(1), a(2), n(3) -> wait, that doesn't match because we need A at position3? 
      ""dance"": D at1, a at2, n at position3? Then what about the rest? We need A at position3? 
      And our pattern is: _ _ A N _ -> so position2 is not A? 

 So ""dance"" would not work because position3 is n? Actually:
      d a n c e -> pattern: 
        position3: n -> not A? And position4: c? Not N? 

 So we cannot use ""dance"" because it doesn't have A at position3 and N at position4? We must have A at 3 and N at 4.

 Back to possibilities: 
   - ""stand"": s t a n d -> good.
   - ""thank"": t h a n k -> good.
   - ""stank"": s t a n k -> good.
   - ""shank"": s h a n k -> good.
   - ""swank"": s w a n k -> good.
   - ""brand"": but b r a n d -> contains r? R is excluded? So no.

 We also have ""plain""? No, because plain has pattern: p l a i n -> which is p(1), l(2), a(3), i(4), n(5) -> but we need n at position4? Here position4 is i -> not matching.

 We need exactly: ...A N at positions 3 and 4.

 So the pattern is: ??AN?

 We'll choose one that helps test common letters? 

 Let's choose ""stand"". It has S, T, D? We haven't tested S, T, D? And we know A and N are already fixed.

 But note: in the pattern, the A and N are fixed, so we are testing the first two letters and the last.

 However, if we guess ""stand"", we might get:

   If the secret word is ""stand"": all correct? We don't know.

   If the secret word has S at 1? Or not? We can learn.

 Alternatively, maybe we choose a word that doesn't repeat letters we already know? We know A and N are present? But we are forced to put them in positions 3 and 4? So we are testing the other positions.

 But we must include A and N at those positions? So we are stuck? 

 However, note: we have to use only valid words. 

 Another idea: we can test other vowels or common consonants? 

 Let me try to list common letters we haven't tested: 
   We tried C,R,A,N,E -> so A and N are known. C, R, E are out.

   We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can choose a word that uses multiple new common letters? 

 The most common letters in English are E (we know absent), T, A (known), O, I, N (known), S, H, R (absent), D, L, U.

 So of the top, we can test T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

 We can try to cover as many of these as possible? But we have only three positions: 1, 2, and 5.

 ""thank"": has T, H, K? K is less common.

 ""stand"": has S, T, D? S is common, T is common, D is common? 

 How about ""stond""? Not a word? 

 How about ""stonk""? Not a word.

 How about ""sting""? But ""sting"": s t i n g -> pattern: 
      position1: s, position2: t, position3: i? -> not A? So we must have A at position3? So ""sting"" doesn't have A at position3? So it's invalid.

 Therefore, I think ""stand"" is a good candidate? 

 But wait, we don't know for sure? Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have A and N? But we must because they are fixed? We have to include A at position3 and N at position4? So we must.

 Therefore, I choose ""stand"". 

 Let's write: 
   <guess>stand</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓)  
- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓)  
- C, R, and E are absent (x)  

The secret word must have the pattern `_ _ A N _`, where the first, second, and fifth letters are *not* C, R, or E.  

For the next guess, I prioritized **testing common unused letters** (like S, T, and D) while maintaining the confirmed A (3rd) and N (4th) positions. Selecting ""stand"" allows us to:  
- Test S at position 1  
- Test T at position 2  
- Test D at position 5  

This helps probe multiple untested common consonants efficiently.

Wait, let\'s look back at the example.\n\n Wait, the example in the initial instructions used BRISK and STORM: \n   STORM: S(-) because S is in the word but not at position 1 (since secret has S at position 4?).\n\n But in our feedback for ""crane"": \n   C was absent -> correct because BRISK doesn\'t have C.\n   R: in ""crane"" is at position 2. The secret BRISK has R at position 2? Then why is R(x) in the feedback? \n\n Actually, wait we are not solving ""BRISK"", we are solving a new word. The example was just an example. So let\'s not confuse.\n\n We have feedback for ""crane"": \n   C(x) -> not in word.\n   R(x) -> not in word? So the secret word does not contain R at all?\n   A(✓) -> in the word and in position 3.\n   N(✓) -> in the word and in position 4.\n   E(x) -> not in word.\n\n Therefore, the secret word has no R, no C, no E.\n\n Now, coming back to our pattern: _ _ A N _\n\n We must choose a word that:\n   - Has the form: [any letter except C,R,E] [any letter except C,R,E] A N [any letter except C,R,E]\n\n Let\'s think of words ending with ""AN"" but note the pattern is fixed: 3rd letter A, 4th letter N.\n\n So the word must be: ? + ? + A + N + ?\n\n Possibilities: \n   - The first letter: any consonant or vowel except C,R,E.\n   - The second letter: similarly.\n   - The fifth letter: similarly.\n\n Some words that fit: \n   - ""stand"": s(t) a(n) d -> wait: \n        s at position1, t at position2, then position3 is a? Actually, ""stand"": s (1), t (2), a (3), n (4), d (5). \n        And stand: letters: s, t, a, n, d -> none of C,R,E. So it\'s valid.\n   - ""handy"": h(1), a(2) -> wait, no: because position3 must be A? But ""handy"": h, a, n, d, y -> positions: 1:h, 2:a, 3:n -> doesn\'t have A at 3 and N at 4? So not matching.\n\n Also, ""panic"": p a n i c -> positions: 1:p, 2:a, 3:n -> so the a is at position2 and n at position3? Not A at position3 and N at position4.\n\n We need: \n   position1: ?\n   position2: ?\n   position3: A\n   position4: N\n   position5: ?\n\n So words like:\n   - ""ocean"": o c e a n -> But we have a at position4? Wait: \n        o (1), c (2), e (3), a (4), n (5) -> pattern A at 4? Not at 3. So no.\n\n How about ""plain""? As I thought earlier: \n   p (1), l (2), a (3), i (4), n (5) -> but wait, position4 is i, not N? And position5 is n? That\'s not matching because we need position4 to be N.\n\n We need position4 to be N. So the pattern must have ...A as the third letter and N as the fourth? Then fifth letter is free.\n\n Valid words:\n   - ""urban"": u(1), r(2), b(3)? Wait: urban: u (1), r (2), b (3), a (4), n (5)? No. That\'s not matching.\n\n Actually:\n\n   We need: \n      letter3: A\n      letter4: N\n\n So the word must be: \n      [1] [2] A N [5]\n\n So: \n      stand: s(1) t(2) a(3) n(4) d(5) -> valid.\n      mania? m a n i a -> no: because positions: m(1), a(2), n(3), i(4), a(5) -> doesn\'t have A at 3? It has n at 3.\n\n How about ""vanish"": but vanish is 6 letters? No, 6 letters? ""vanish"" is 5? \n      v a n i s h -> that\'s 6? Actually, 5: v,a,n,i,sh? Wait, no: vanish is 5 letters? v,a,n,i,sh? \n      Actually: V-A-N-I-S-H -> 6 letters? So let\'s stick to 5.\n\n Let me list 5-letter words that have A as the third and N as the fourth letter:\n   - ""stand"": s t a n d\n   - ""thank"": t h a n k\n   - ""stank"": s t a n k\n   - ""black""? b l a c k -> but c is excluded? But we\'ll avoid C anyway? Oh, C is excluded? The feedback says C(x) -> so we cannot use C? \n        But ""black"" has C? So skip.\n   - ""clank""? Now, C and also we don\'t know if L is allowed? But we already know C is excluded? So invalid.\n\n What about ""bland"": b l a n d -> But we haven\'t tested B and L? And D is also not known.\n\n However, we also need to test new letters? So let\'s choose a word that gives us more information? We don\'t have information on the vowels? Or consonants? \n\n We know A and N are fixed. So we must fill in positions 1,2,5.\n\n Since we have three positions to figure out, and we have 4 remaining guesses? Actually, we are at the second guess.\n\n We can choose a word that uses common letters for positions 1,2,5.\n\n Common letters to test: maybe S, T, L, D, K, etc.\n\n But note: we want to avoid C, R, E.\n\n Let me consider ""stand"": it has S, T, D? Also, if we guess ""stand"", we test S at position1, T at position2, and D at position5.\n\n Alternatively, ""thank"" would test T, H, K.\n\n Another option: ""dance""? But ""dance"": \n      d(1), a(2), n(3) -> wait, that doesn\'t match because we need A at position3? \n      ""dance"": D at1, a at2, n at position3? Then what about the rest? We need A at position3? \n      And our pattern is: _ _ A N _ -> so position2 is not A? \n\n So ""dance"" would not work because position3 is n? Actually:\n      d a n c e -> pattern: \n        position3: n -> not A? And position4: c? Not N? \n\n So we cannot use ""dance"" because it doesn\'t have A at position3 and N at position4? We must have A at 3 and N at 4.\n\n Back to possibilities: \n   - ""stand"": s t a n d -> good.\n   - ""thank"": t h a n k -> good.\n   - ""stank"": s t a n k -> good.\n   - ""shank"": s h a n k -> good.\n   - ""swank"": s w a n k -> good.\n   - ""brand"": but b r a n d -> contains r? R is excluded? So no.\n\n We also have ""plain""? No, because plain has pattern: p l a i n -> which is p(1), l(2), a(3), i(4), n(5) -> but we need n at position4? Here position4 is i -> not matching.\n\n We need exactly: ...A N at positions 3 and 4.\n\n So the pattern is: ??AN?\n\n We\'ll choose one that helps test common letters? \n\n Let\'s choose ""stand"". It has S, T, D? We haven\'t tested S, T, D? And we know A and N are already fixed.\n\n But note: in the pattern, the A and N are fixed, so we are testing the first two letters and the last.\n\n However, if we guess ""stand"", we might get:\n\n   If the secret word is ""stand"": all correct? We don\'t know.\n\n   If the secret word has S at 1? Or not? We can learn.\n\n Alternatively, maybe we choose a word that doesn\'t repeat letters we already know? We know A and N are present? But we are forced to put them in positions 3 and 4? So we are testing the other positions.\n\n But we must include A and N at those positions? So we are stuck? \n\n However, note: we have to use only valid words. \n\n Another idea: we can test other vowels or common consonants? \n\n Let me try to list common letters we haven\'t tested: \n   We tried C,R,A,N,E -> so A and N are known. C, R, E are out.\n\n   We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We can choose a word that uses multiple new common letters? \n\n The most common letters in English are E (we know absent), T, A (known), O, I, N (known), S, H, R (absent), D, L, U.\n\n So of the top, we can test T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.\n\n We can try to cover as many of these as possible? But we have only three positions: 1, 2, and 5.\n\n ""thank"": has T, H, K? K is less common.\n\n ""stand"": has S, T, D? S is common, T is common, D is common? \n\n How about ""stond""? Not a word? \n\n How about ""stonk""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""sting""? But ""sting"": s t i n g -> pattern: \n      position1: s, position2: t, position3: i? -> not A? So we must have A at position3? So ""sting"" doesn\'t have A at position3? So it\'s invalid.\n\n Therefore, I think ""stand"" is a good candidate? \n\n But wait, we don\'t know for sure? Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t have A and N? But we must because they are fixed? We have to include A at position3 and N at position4? So we must.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""stand"". \n\n Let\'s write: \n   <guess>stand</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓)  \n- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓)  \n- C, R, and E are absent (x)  \n\nThe secret word must have the pattern `_ _ A N _`, where the first, second, and fifth letters are *not* C, R, or E.  \n\nFor the next guess, I prioritized **testing common unused letters** (like S, T, and D) while maintaining the confirmed A (3rd) and N (4th) positions. Selecting ""stand"" allows us to:  \n- Test S at position 1  \n- Test T at position 2  \n- Test D at position 5  \n\nThis helps probe multiple untested common consonants efficiently.\n\n<guess>stand</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the second guess: ""stand"" -> S(x), T(x), A(✓), N(✓), D(x)
 This tells us:
   - A and N are still correctly placed at positions 3 and 4? Specifically, A at position 3 and N at position 4? Yes, same as before? But note the pattern does not change? 
   - We now know that S, T, and D are also not in the word? So the secret word does not contain S, T, or D.

 Previously, we knew it doesn't contain C, R, E? 
 And now, added S, T, D? So absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, D.

 Present letters: 
   We only know A (at position 3) and N (at position 4)? And no new letters? 

 So the secret word pattern is: _ _ A N _ 
   - The first letter must be one of the remaining letters (not C,R,E,S,T,D) -> excludes these six.
   - The second letter must be one of the remaining letters (same exclusion).
   - The fifth letter must be one of the remaining letters.

 We must choose a word that:
   - Has the pattern: ? ? A N ?
   - Does not contain C,R,E,S,T,D? 
   - And uses new letters to get more information.

 Since A and N are fixed? We cannot change them? They must be at positions 3 and 4? 

 How many possibilities? What letters are available? 
   Letters available: 
     Not excluded: 
        A,B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 
        But A and N are already in the word? They might be used? But we don't know if duplicates? 
        However, we haven't had any indication of duplicates? 

 Steps:
   We need to test other common letters? The most common remaining are O, I, L, U, M, P, etc.

 Pattern: 
   Position1: any letter except C,R,E,S,T,D
   Position2: same exclusion? 
   Position3: A (fixed) 
   Position4: N (fixed) 
   Position5: any letter except C,R,E,S,T,D

 How about choosing a word that uses as many new common letters as possible? 

 Example words? 
   - ""plain"": p l a i n -> but ""plain"" is: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)? But wait, our pattern requires N at position4? But plain has I at position4 and N at position5? So that doesn't fit? 

   We require the third letter to be A and the fourth letter to be N? So the word must be: [letter1][letter2] A N [letter5] -> so the last letter? 

   Words that work? 
     - ""urban"": u r b a n -> wait: 
          u(1), r(2)? But R is excluded? -> no.
     - ""woman"": w o m a n -> positions: 
          w(1), o(2), m(3), a(4), n(5)? -> but our pattern requires A at position3 and N at position4? So why would the third letter be A? In ""woman"", the third letter is M? 

     So we need the third letter to be A and the fourth to be N? 

     How about ""koan""? But that's 4 letters? 

     5-letter words? 
        ""pagan""? p a g a n -> positions: p(1), a(2), g(3), a(4), n(5) -> has A at position2 and4? But doesn't have A at position3? 
        ""organ"": o r g a n -> R excluded? 
        ""viral"": not matching pattern? 

     ""grain"": g r a i n -> but R excluded? 

     ""chain"": c h a i n -> C excluded? 

     ""brain"": b r a i n -> R excluded? 

     ""train"": t r a i n -> T excluded? 

     ""plain"": but wait, if we break down: 
          P at1, L at2, A at3 -> then the fourth letter must be N? But ""plain"" has I at4 and N at5? So the pattern mismatch? 

     Alternatively, we can have words like: 
          ""awning"": too long? 

     What about ""cran"" something? But we must have 5 letters? 

     Actually, let's list 5-letter words with A as the third letter and N as the fourth letter? 

        ? ? A N ? -> so the word ends with AN but not at the end? Actually, AN is the third and fourth? Then the fifth letter is after N? 

        Examples: 
          - ""stand"" -> we tried and now excluded? 
          - ""thank"" -> but T and H? T is excluded? 
          - ""blank"" -> B L A N K -> but B, L, K are still possible? However, we haven't tested? And it doesn't contain excluded letters? 

        But wait, we haven't tested B, L, K? 

        However, we know T is excluded? So ""thank"" is invalid because T is excluded? Similarly, ""stank"" has S and T? Also invalid? 

        ""flank"": f l a n k -> contains F, L, K? Which we haven't tested? 
        ""blank"": b l a n k -> B, L, K? 
        ""plank"": p l a n k -> P, L, K? 
        ""clank"": but C is excluded? 
        ""slank"" not a word? 

        Also, words ending in AN? 
          ""human"": h u m a n -> pattern: h(1), u(2), m(3), a(4), n(5) -> but we need A at position3? So no? 
          ""woman"": same? 

        Or ""ocean"": o c e a n -> but has C? 

        How about ""again""? a g a i n -> positions: a(1), g(2), a(3), i(4), n(5) -> but we need the fourth letter to be N? This has i at4 and n at5? So no? 

        But wait, what about ""begin""? b e g i n -> has E? excluded? 

        We must stick to the pattern: the third letter is A and the fourth is N? 

        So we consider: 
          flank, plank, blank, clank (invalid because of C), skank? But skank has S and K? S excluded so invalid? 

        Also, ""think"" but that has T? excluded? 

        Another word: ""wanna""? But that's 5? w a n n a? positions: w(1), a(2), n(3), n(4), a(5)? -> pattern: third letter? n? not A? 

        How about ""wanza""? Not a word? 

        Another: ""kbang""? Not a word? 

        Valid ones: 
          flank, plank, blank? 

        So let's think: 
          flank: f(1), l(2), a(3), n(4), k(5) -> fits pattern? and letters: F,L,A,N,K? 
          A and N we know? But we don't know F,L,K? 

        Similarly, blank: B,L,A,N,K? -> and plank: P,L,A,N,K? 

        We don't have information about these? 

        Also, a word like ""manga"": m a n g a? pattern: m(1), a(2), n(3), g(4), a(5) -> third letter is N? not A? So doesn't work? 

        How about ""kana""? 4 letters? 

        So possibilities? 
          flank, blank, plank, spank (has S? excluded), stank (excluded because T), thank (T excluded), shank (S excluded)? 

        Actually, shank: s has been excluded? 

        So we have: flank, blank, plank? 

        Also, let me think? ""xanadu""? too long? 

        Another: ""vanda""? v a n d a? -> but has D? and pattern: third letter? D? wait: 
          v(1), a(2), n(3), d(4), a(5) -> but we need A at the third? So no? 

        ""bhang""? b h a n g? -> pattern: b(1), h(2), a(3), n(4), g(5)? -> so yes? 

        And ""bhang"" is a word? Yes? I'll assume it is? 

        Also, ""lang"" no? 

        But let's use a more common word? 

        We are going with: flank, plank, blank? 

        How about words starting with vowels? 
          ""again"" -> doesn't fit? 
          ""ocean"" -> doesn't fit and has C? 
          ""aeons"" -> doesn't have the pattern? 

        So we'll choose from flank, plank, blank? 

        We want to test multiple new letters? 

        But note: we have limited guesses? And we haven't tested several letters? 

        Alternatively, we might choose a word that does not have L? Because if we choose one? 

        How about ""banal""? but pattern: b a n a l? positions: 
          b(1), a(2), n(3), a(4), l(5) -> but we require A at position3? So this has A at position2? => doesn't fit? 

        Another: ""cab"" something? All too short? 

        Actually, let's list possible words again: 
          ""graan"" not a word? 
          ""craic"" not a word and has C? 
          ""kyang""? but I don't know? 

        Maybe it's better to pick a word that tests common letters? 

        Let me choose ""blank""? It has B, L, K? 

        But note: we have positions 1,2,5? 

        So if we guess ""blank"": 
           Position1: B -> if it's correct? or at least in the word? 
           Position2: L -> test L? 
           Position5: K -> test K? 

        Alternatively, ""plank"" tests P, L, K? 

        Which one is better? 

        Common letters? 
           In English, L is more common than P? But K is about the same? 

        But B is more common than P? Actually, P is more common? 

        According to frequency: 
           E T A O I N S H R D L U ... 
           Now, E,T,R,A,O,I,N,S,H,D,L ... 

          Since E,T,R are eliminated? The next common: A (known), O, I, N (known), S (out), H (not tested), D (out), L ... 

        So maybe we test O, I, H? 

        But problem: we have to form a word that fits the pattern? And we cannot put O or I or H at position1 or 2? 

        How about words like ""khans"" has S and T? not? 

        What about ""oaths"" ... pattern doesn't match? 

        Alternatively, we can avoid putting any of B, P, and test a word with H? 

        Example: ""whang""? w h a n g -> 
           positions: w(1), h(2), a(3), n(4), g(5) -> fits pattern? 
           and uses W, H, G? 

        But we haven't tested H? W? G? 

        How about ""khans""? s at the end? excluded? 

        ""whang"" is a word? Yes? 

        Also, ""bhais"" not? 

        Another: ""shank"" -> invalid because S? 

        How about ""thank"" -> T? invalid? 

        So ""whang""? 

        Or ""chank""? C? excluded? 

        So possible words: 
          flank (F,L,K), blank (B,L,K), plank (P,L,K), whang (W,H,G), hang? too short? 

        ""whang"" is 5 letters: w h a n g -> so yes? 

        We need to choose one? 

        How about ""human"" ... no? 

        Another: ""paean""? p a e a n? -> but has E? excluded? 

        So? 

        I think ""whang"" is a good candidate? Because H is very common? 

        Or also, how about ""laugh""? l a u g h -> but pattern: l(1), a(2), u(3)? doesn't have A at position3? So invalid? 

        Alternatively, we can use ""again"" ... doesn't fit? 

        What about ""aaron""? It's 5? But has two A's? But pattern: a(1), a(2), r(3) ...? -> no? 

        Another: ""japan""? j a p a n -> positions: j(1), a(2), p(3), a(4), n(5) -> third letter is P? not A? 

        So yes, the words with the pattern ...AN... as the third and fourth letter are limited? 

        We'll choose ""whang"": 
          w at position1: test w? 
          h at position2: test h? 
          g at position5: test g? 

        And avoid F,L,K,B,P? 

        But if the secret is ""flank"" or ""blank""? We don't know? 

        Alternatively, we choose ""flank"" to test F,L,K? 

        How about we choose a word that uses multiple high-frequency remaining letters? 

        High frequency letters not tested? 
          O, I, L, U, H, ... 

        Unfortunately, they are hard to fit? 

        Another word: ""clang"" -> C excluded? 

        ""yangs"" has S? 

        ""bhang"": b h a n g -> 
           position: b(1), h(2), a(3), n(4), g(5) -> fits? 
           but we haven't tested B, H, G? 

        So which word? 

        Let me choose ""bhang""? Or ""whang""? 

        Since we have few options? I'll go with ""blank"" as it has common letters? But B, L, K? 

        But let's remember: we are at the third guess? And we have 3 more? 

        Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat letters? But we have to put A and N? 

        We have no duplicate letters? 

        Let me choose ""flank""? Why? 
          It has F, L, and K? Not tested? 
          And F is less common? Maybe we can eliminate? 

        But note: we don't know? 

        How about we choose ""piano""? But pattern? p i a n o -> 
           position: p(1), i(2), a(3), n(4), o(5) -> perfect! 
           But wait, does it contain an o? Yes? 
           And it doesn't have any excluded letters? 

        And how? 
          Letters: P,I,A,N,O 
          Excluded: C,R,E,S,T,D -> P,I,O are new? 

        But ""piano"" uses A and N at the right positions? 

        Also, it tests P at1, I at2, O at5? 

        This is brilliant? We didn't think of ""piano""? 

        Why didn't we? Because the pattern: ...A N..? And ""piano"": 
           Piano: P-I-A-N-O -> 
              P (1), I (2), A (3), N (4), O (5) -> matches the pattern? 

        And this doesn't use L or K? It uses P, I, O? 

        And I, O are vowels? Common? 

        So ""piano"" is a valid word? 

        So I'll choose ""piano"" as my guess? 

        This way, we test three new common letters? 

        Alternatively, ""frown"" ... but not matching pattern? 

        So yes: 
            <guess>piano</guess>
</think>
Based on feedback:  
- **""crane""**: A(✓) in position 3 and N(✓) in position 4, with C/R/E absent (x) → pattern `? ? A N ?`, excluding C/R/E.  
- **""stand""**: S(x), T(x), D(x) confirmed absent → pattern remains `? ? A N ?`, now excluding C/R/E/S/T/D.  

Available letters: A,B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding known absent letters).  

**Strategy**:  
- Test common unused letters (e.g., O, I, L) while keeping A/N in positions 3/4.  
- ""piano"" fits perfectly: P/I/O new letters, A/N fixed. Tests:  
  - P at position 1  
  - I at position 2  
  - O at position 5  

""piano"" maximizes coverage of high-frequency letters (I/O) and probes key positions efficiently.

<guess>piano</guess>",piano,"We have feedback from the second guess: ""stand"" -> S(x), T(x), A(✓), N(✓), D(x)
 This tells us:
   - A and N are still correctly placed at positions 3 and 4? Specifically, A at position 3 and N at position 4? Yes, same as before? But note the pattern does not change? 
   - We now know that S, T, and D are also not in the word? So the secret word does not contain S, T, or D.

 Previously, we knew it doesn't contain C, R, E? 
 And now, added S, T, D? So absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, D.

 Present letters: 
   We only know A (at position 3) and N (at position 4)? And no new letters? 

 So the secret word pattern is: _ _ A N _ 
   - The first letter must be one of the remaining letters (not C,R,E,S,T,D) -> excludes these six.
   - The second letter must be one of the remaining letters (same exclusion).
   - The fifth letter must be one of the remaining letters.

 We must choose a word that:
   - Has the pattern: ? ? A N ?
   - Does not contain C,R,E,S,T,D? 
   - And uses new letters to get more information.

 Since A and N are fixed? We cannot change them? They must be at positions 3 and 4? 

 How many possibilities? What letters are available? 
   Letters available: 
     Not excluded: 
        A,B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 
        But A and N are already in the word? They might be used? But we don't know if duplicates? 
        However, we haven't had any indication of duplicates? 

 Steps:
   We need to test other common letters? The most common remaining are O, I, L, U, M, P, etc.

 Pattern: 
   Position1: any letter except C,R,E,S,T,D
   Position2: same exclusion? 
   Position3: A (fixed) 
   Position4: N (fixed) 
   Position5: any letter except C,R,E,S,T,D

 How about choosing a word that uses as many new common letters as possible? 

 Example words? 
   - ""plain"": p l a i n -> but ""plain"" is: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)? But wait, our pattern requires N at position4? But plain has I at position4 and N at position5? So that doesn't fit? 

   We require the third letter to be A and the fourth letter to be N? So the word must be: [letter1][letter2] A N [letter5] -> so the last letter? 

   Words that work? 
     - ""urban"": u r b a n -> wait: 
          u(1), r(2)? But R is excluded? -> no.
     - ""woman"": w o m a n -> positions: 
          w(1), o(2), m(3), a(4), n(5)? -> but our pattern requires A at position3 and N at position4? So why would the third letter be A? In ""woman"", the third letter is M? 

     So we need the third letter to be A and the fourth to be N? 

     How about ""koan""? But that's 4 letters? 

     5-letter words? 
        ""pagan""? p a g a n -> positions: p(1), a(2), g(3), a(4), n(5) -> has A at position2 and4? But doesn't have A at position3? 
        ""organ"": o r g a n -> R excluded? 
        ""viral"": not matching pattern? 

     ""grain"": g r a i n -> but R excluded? 

     ""chain"": c h a i n -> C excluded? 

     ""brain"": b r a i n -> R excluded? 

     ""train"": t r a i n -> T excluded? 

     ""plain"": but wait, if we break down: 
          P at1, L at2, A at3 -> then the fourth letter must be N? But ""plain"" has I at4 and N at5? So the pattern mismatch? 

     Alternatively, we can have words like: 
          ""awning"": too long? 

     What about ""cran"" something? But we must have 5 letters? 

     Actually, let's list 5-letter words with A as the third letter and N as the fourth letter? 

        ? ? A N ? -> so the word ends with AN but not at the end? Actually, AN is the third and fourth? Then the fifth letter is after N? 

        Examples: 
          - ""stand"" -> we tried and now excluded? 
          - ""thank"" -> but T and H? T is excluded? 
          - ""blank"" -> B L A N K -> but B, L, K are still possible? However, we haven't tested? And it doesn't contain excluded letters? 

        But wait, we haven't tested B, L, K? 

        However, we know T is excluded? So ""thank"" is invalid because T is excluded? Similarly, ""stank"" has S and T? Also invalid? 

        ""flank"": f l a n k -> contains F, L, K? Which we haven't tested? 
        ""blank"": b l a n k -> B, L, K? 
        ""plank"": p l a n k -> P, L, K? 
        ""clank"": but C is excluded? 
        ""slank"" not a word? 

        Also, words ending in AN? 
          ""human"": h u m a n -> pattern: h(1), u(2), m(3), a(4), n(5) -> but we need A at position3? So no? 
          ""woman"": same? 

        Or ""ocean"": o c e a n -> but has C? 

        How about ""again""? a g a i n -> positions: a(1), g(2), a(3), i(4), n(5) -> but we need the fourth letter to be N? This has i at4 and n at5? So no? 

        But wait, what about ""begin""? b e g i n -> has E? excluded? 

        We must stick to the pattern: the third letter is A and the fourth is N? 

        So we consider: 
          flank, plank, blank, clank (invalid because of C), skank? But skank has S and K? S excluded so invalid? 

        Also, ""think"" but that has T? excluded? 

        Another word: ""wanna""? But that's 5? w a n n a? positions: w(1), a(2), n(3), n(4), a(5)? -> pattern: third letter? n? not A? 

        How about ""wanza""? Not a word? 

        Another: ""kbang""? Not a word? 

        Valid ones: 
          flank, plank, blank? 

        So let's think: 
          flank: f(1), l(2), a(3), n(4), k(5) -> fits pattern? and letters: F,L,A,N,K? 
          A and N we know? But we don't know F,L,K? 

        Similarly, blank: B,L,A,N,K? -> and plank: P,L,A,N,K? 

        We don't have information about these? 

        Also, a word like ""manga"": m a n g a? pattern: m(1), a(2), n(3), g(4), a(5) -> third letter is N? not A? So doesn't work? 

        How about ""kana""? 4 letters? 

        So possibilities? 
          flank, blank, plank, spank (has S? excluded), stank (excluded because T), thank (T excluded), shank (S excluded)? 

        Actually, shank: s has been excluded? 

        So we have: flank, blank, plank? 

        Also, let me think? ""xanadu""? too long? 

        Another: ""vanda""? v a n d a? -> but has D? and pattern: third letter? D? wait: 
          v(1), a(2), n(3), d(4), a(5) -> but we need A at the third? So no? 

        ""bhang""? b h a n g? -> pattern: b(1), h(2), a(3), n(4), g(5)? -> so yes? 

        And ""bhang"" is a word? Yes? I'll assume it is? 

        Also, ""lang"" no? 

        But let's use a more common word? 

        We are going with: flank, plank, blank? 

        How about words starting with vowels? 
          ""again"" -> doesn't fit? 
          ""ocean"" -> doesn't fit and has C? 
          ""aeons"" -> doesn't have the pattern? 

        So we'll choose from flank, plank, blank? 

        We want to test multiple new letters? 

        But note: we have limited guesses? And we haven't tested several letters? 

        Alternatively, we might choose a word that does not have L? Because if we choose one? 

        How about ""banal""? but pattern: b a n a l? positions: 
          b(1), a(2), n(3), a(4), l(5) -> but we require A at position3? So this has A at position2? => doesn't fit? 

        Another: ""cab"" something? All too short? 

        Actually, let's list possible words again: 
          ""graan"" not a word? 
          ""craic"" not a word and has C? 
          ""kyang""? but I don't know? 

        Maybe it's better to pick a word that tests common letters? 

        Let me choose ""blank""? It has B, L, K? 

        But note: we have positions 1,2,5? 

        So if we guess ""blank"": 
           Position1: B -> if it's correct? or at least in the word? 
           Position2: L -> test L? 
           Position5: K -> test K? 

        Alternatively, ""plank"" tests P, L, K? 

        Which one is better? 

        Common letters? 
           In English, L is more common than P? But K is about the same? 

        But B is more common than P? Actually, P is more common? 

        According to frequency: 
           E T A O I N S H R D L U ... 
           Now, E,T,R,A,O,I,N,S,H,D,L ... 

          Since E,T,R are eliminated? The next common: A (known), O, I, N (known), S (out), H (not tested), D (out), L ... 

        So maybe we test O, I, H? 

        But problem: we have to form a word that fits the pattern? And we cannot put O or I or H at position1 or 2? 

        How about words like ""khans"" has S and T? not? 

        What about ""oaths"" ... pattern doesn't match? 

        Alternatively, we can avoid putting any of B, P, and test a word with H? 

        Example: ""whang""? w h a n g -> 
           positions: w(1), h(2), a(3), n(4), g(5) -> fits pattern? 
           and uses W, H, G? 

        But we haven't tested H? W? G? 

        How about ""khans""? s at the end? excluded? 

        ""whang"" is a word? Yes? 

        Also, ""bhais"" not? 

        Another: ""shank"" -> invalid because S? 

        How about ""thank"" -> T? invalid? 

        So ""whang""? 

        Or ""chank""? C? excluded? 

        So possible words: 
          flank (F,L,K), blank (B,L,K), plank (P,L,K), whang (W,H,G), hang? too short? 

        ""whang"" is 5 letters: w h a n g -> so yes? 

        We need to choose one? 

        How about ""human"" ... no? 

        Another: ""paean""? p a e a n? -> but has E? excluded? 

        So? 

        I think ""whang"" is a good candidate? Because H is very common? 

        Or also, how about ""laugh""? l a u g h -> but pattern: l(1), a(2), u(3)? doesn't have A at position3? So invalid? 

        Alternatively, we can use ""again"" ... doesn't fit? 

        What about ""aaron""? It's 5? But has two A's? But pattern: a(1), a(2), r(3) ...? -> no? 

        Another: ""japan""? j a p a n -> positions: j(1), a(2), p(3), a(4), n(5) -> third letter is P? not A? 

        So yes, the words with the pattern ...AN... as the third and fourth letter are limited? 

        We'll choose ""whang"": 
          w at position1: test w? 
          h at position2: test h? 
          g at position5: test g? 

        And avoid F,L,K,B,P? 

        But if the secret is ""flank"" or ""blank""? We don't know? 

        Alternatively, we choose ""flank"" to test F,L,K? 

        How about we choose a word that uses multiple high-frequency remaining letters? 

        High frequency letters not tested? 
          O, I, L, U, H, ... 

        Unfortunately, they are hard to fit? 

        Another word: ""clang"" -> C excluded? 

        ""yangs"" has S? 

        ""bhang"": b h a n g -> 
           position: b(1), h(2), a(3), n(4), g(5) -> fits? 
           but we haven't tested B, H, G? 

        So which word? 

        Let me choose ""bhang""? Or ""whang""? 

        Since we have few options? I'll go with ""blank"" as it has common letters? But B, L, K? 

        But let's remember: we are at the third guess? And we have 3 more? 

        Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat letters? But we have to put A and N? 

        We have no duplicate letters? 

        Let me choose ""flank""? Why? 
          It has F, L, and K? Not tested? 
          And F is less common? Maybe we can eliminate? 

        But note: we don't know? 

        How about we choose ""piano""? But pattern? p i a n o -> 
           position: p(1), i(2), a(3), n(4), o(5) -> perfect! 
           But wait, does it contain an o? Yes? 
           And it doesn't have any excluded letters? 

        And how? 
          Letters: P,I,A,N,O 
          Excluded: C,R,E,S,T,D -> P,I,O are new? 

        But ""piano"" uses A and N at the right positions? 

        Also, it tests P at1, I at2, O at5? 

        This is brilliant? We didn't think of ""piano""? 

        Why didn't we? Because the pattern: ...A N..? And ""piano"": 
           Piano: P-I-A-N-O -> 
              P (1), I (2), A (3), N (4), O (5) -> matches the pattern? 

        And this doesn't use L or K? It uses P, I, O? 

        And I, O are vowels? Common? 

        So ""piano"" is a valid word? 

        So I'll choose ""piano"" as my guess? 

        This way, we test three new common letters? 

        Alternatively, ""frown"" ... but not matching pattern? 

        So yes: 
            <guess>piano</guess>Based on feedback:  
- **""crane""**: A(✓) in position 3 and N(✓) in position 4, with C/R/E absent (x) → pattern `? ? A N ?`, excluding C/R/E.  
- **""stand""**: S(x), T(x), D(x) confirmed absent → pattern remains `? ? A N ?`, now excluding C/R/E/S/T/D.  

Available letters: A,B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding known absent letters).  

**Strategy**:

  - I at position 2  
  - O at position 5

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,PLANK,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)
 This tells us:
   - A and N are in the secret word and in the correct positions. Specifically, A is the 3rd letter and N is the 4th letter (since ""crane"" is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).
   - The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A N _

 We know the word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.

 We also know that the letters C, R, and E are absent.

 For our next guess, we need to:
   - Keep A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.
   - Avoid using any of the letters C, R, E.

 We also want to test new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

 Since A and N are fixed, the word is ? ? A N ?

 We don't know the 1st, 2nd, and 5th letters, and they must be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, E.

 Common letters we might try: we can try words that have other vowels and common consonants.

 What words fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and do not contain C, R, E?
 Let's think of possible words: 
   - We might consider ""urban"": U in 1st, R in 2nd? But wait, R is in the feedback as not present (x). So we must avoid R. So ""urban"" is invalid because it contains R.
   - ""man"" at the end? Words like ""laugh"" but no, because the pattern is fixed at A in 3rd and N in 4th.

 Actually, the pattern must have the 3rd letter A and 4th letter N, so:
   ... A N ...

 Words: 
   - plain? p l A i n -> but n is already the 4th? wait, ""plain"" has ""a"" at position 3? Let's see: positions: 1:p, 2:l, 3:a, 4:i, 5:n -> that doesn't match because we need N at position 4, but ""plain"" has i at 4 and n at 5.

 We need exactly: position1=?, position2=?, position3=A, position4=N, position5=?

 So the word ends with the 4th letter as N? Not necessarily, because we have one more letter after N? Actually, no: we have A at 3 and N at 4. Then there is the 5th letter.

 Example words: 
   - ""train"": t at1, r at2 -> but R is excluded, so no.
   - ""chain"": c at1 -> C is excluded, so no.
   - ""again"": a at1 -> but we can try? But note: we have to avoid using E, R, C? And ""again"" has A at 1 which we don't know if it's allowed? Actually, we can have A as the first letter? But note that we have no information about A in the first position? However, we already have an A at position 3, so if there is another A, that's possible? But the feedback did not indicate two A's. However, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters explicitly? 

 But note the feedback rules: 
   - In feedback, if a letter appears multiple times, it can be tricky. However, in this case, the first guess ""crane"" only had one A and it was in the correct position. So if the word has two A's, the other A might be marked as absent or present? Actually, the feedback would show the occurrence only if it exists? 

 Let me clarify: 
   - The secret word is BRISK. We guessed ""crane"": 
        C is not in BRISK -> x
        R is in BRISK? Actually, BRISK has R at the second position? But in ""crane"", R is at the second position. However, the secret word BRISK has R at position 2? Then why was R marked as (x)? ... Wait, let's look back at the example.

 Wait, the example in the initial instructions used BRISK and STORM: 
   STORM: S(-) because S is in the word but not at position 1 (since secret has S at position 4?).

 But in our feedback for ""crane"": 
   C was absent -> correct because BRISK doesn't have C.
   R: in ""crane"" is at position 2. The secret BRISK has R at position 2? Then why is R(x) in the feedback? 

 Actually, wait we are not solving ""BRISK"", we are solving a new word. The example was just an example. So let's not confuse.

 We have feedback for ""crane"": 
   C(x) -> not in word.
   R(x) -> not in word? So the secret word does not contain R at all?
   A(✓) -> in the word and in position 3.
   N(✓) -> in the word and in position 4.
   E(x) -> not in word.

 Therefore, the secret word has no R, no C, no E.

 Now, coming back to our pattern: _ _ A N _

 We must choose a word that:
   - Has the form: [any letter except C,R,E] [any letter except C,R,E] A N [any letter except C,R,E]

 Let's think of words ending with ""AN"" but note the pattern is fixed: 3rd letter A, 4th letter N.

 So the word must be: ? + ? + A + N + ?

 Possibilities: 
   - The first letter: any consonant or vowel except C,R,E.
   - The second letter: similarly.
   - The fifth letter: similarly.

 Some words that fit: 
   - ""stand"": s(t) a(n) d -> wait: 
        s at position1, t at position2, then position3 is a? Actually, ""stand"": s (1), t (2), a (3), n (4), d (5). 
        And stand: letters: s, t, a, n, d -> none of C,R,E. So it's valid.
   - ""handy"": h(1), a(2) -> wait, no: because position3 must be A? But ""handy"": h, a, n, d, y -> positions: 1:h, 2:a, 3:n -> doesn't have A at 3 and N at 4? So not matching.

 Also, ""panic"": p a n i c -> positions: 1:p, 2:a, 3:n -> so the a is at position2 and n at position3? Not A at position3 and N at position4.

 We need: 
   position1: ?
   position2: ?
   position3: A
   position4: N
   position5: ?

 So words like:
   - ""ocean"": o c e a n -> But we have a at position4? Wait: 
        o (1), c (2), e (3), a (4), n (5) -> pattern A at 4? Not at 3. So no.

 How about ""plain""? As I thought earlier: 
   p (1), l (2), a (3), i (4), n (5) -> but wait, position4 is i, not N? And position5 is n? That's not matching because we need position4 to be N.

 We need position4 to be N. So the pattern must have ...A as the third letter and N as the fourth? Then fifth letter is free.

 Valid words:
   - ""urban"": u(1), r(2), b(3)? Wait: urban: u (1), r (2), b (3), a (4), n (5)? No. That's not matching.

 Actually:

   We need: 
      letter3: A
      letter4: N

 So the word must be: 
      [1] [2] A N [5]

 So: 
      stand: s(1) t(2) a(3) n(4) d(5) -> valid.
      mania? m a n i a -> no: because positions: m(1), a(2), n(3), i(4), a(5) -> doesn't have A at 3? It has n at 3.

 How about ""vanish"": but vanish is 6 letters? No, 6 letters? ""vanish"" is 5? 
      v a n i s h -> that's 6? Actually, 5: v,a,n,i,sh? Wait, no: vanish is 5 letters? v,a,n,i,sh? 
      Actually: V-A-N-I-S-H -> 6 letters? So let's stick to 5.

 Let me list 5-letter words that have A as the third and N as the fourth letter:
   - ""stand"": s t a n d
   - ""thank"": t h a n k
   - ""stank"": s t a n k
   - ""black""? b l a c k -> but c is excluded? But we'll avoid C anyway? Oh, C is excluded? The feedback says C(x) -> so we cannot use C? 
        But ""black"" has C? So skip.
   - ""clank""? Now, C and also we don't know if L is allowed? But we already know C is excluded? So invalid.

 What about ""bland"": b l a n d -> But we haven't tested B and L? And D is also not known.

 However, we also need to test new letters? So let's choose a word that gives us more information? We don't have information on the vowels? Or consonants? 

 We know A and N are fixed. So we must fill in positions 1,2,5.

 Since we have three positions to figure out, and we have 4 remaining guesses? Actually, we are at the second guess.

 We can choose a word that uses common letters for positions 1,2,5.

 Common letters to test: maybe S, T, L, D, K, etc.

 But note: we want to avoid C, R, E.

 Let me consider ""stand"": it has S, T, D? Also, if we guess ""stand"", we test S at position1, T at position2, and D at position5.

 Alternatively, ""thank"" would test T, H, K.

 Another option: ""dance""? But ""dance"": 
      d(1), a(2), n(3) -> wait, that doesn't match because we need A at position3? 
      ""dance"": D at1, a at2, n at position3? Then what about the rest? We need A at position3? 
      And our pattern is: _ _ A N _ -> so position2 is not A? 

 So ""dance"" would not work because position3 is n? Actually:
      d a n c e -> pattern: 
        position3: n -> not A? And position4: c? Not N? 

 So we cannot use ""dance"" because it doesn't have A at position3 and N at position4? We must have A at 3 and N at 4.

 Back to possibilities: 
   - ""stand"": s t a n d -> good.
   - ""thank"": t h a n k -> good.
   - ""stank"": s t a n k -> good.
   - ""shank"": s h a n k -> good.
   - ""swank"": s w a n k -> good.
   - ""brand"": but b r a n d -> contains r? R is excluded? So no.

 We also have ""plain""? No, because plain has pattern: p l a i n -> which is p(1), l(2), a(3), i(4), n(5) -> but we need n at position4? Here position4 is i -> not matching.

 We need exactly: ...A N at positions 3 and 4.

 So the pattern is: ??AN?

 We'll choose one that helps test common letters? 

 Let's choose ""stand"". It has S, T, D? We haven't tested S, T, D? And we know A and N are already fixed.

 But note: in the pattern, the A and N are fixed, so we are testing the first two letters and the last.

 However, if we guess ""stand"", we might get:

   If the secret word is ""stand"": all correct? We don't know.

   If the secret word has S at 1? Or not? We can learn.

 Alternatively, maybe we choose a word that doesn't repeat letters we already know? We know A and N are present? But we are forced to put them in positions 3 and 4? So we are testing the other positions.

 But we must include A and N at those positions? So we are stuck? 

 However, note: we have to use only valid words. 

 Another idea: we can test other vowels or common consonants? 

 Let me try to list common letters we haven't tested: 
   We tried C,R,A,N,E -> so A and N are known. C, R, E are out.

   We haven't tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can choose a word that uses multiple new common letters? 

 The most common letters in English are E (we know absent), T, A (known), O, I, N (known), S, H, R (absent), D, L, U.

 So of the top, we can test T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.

 We can try to cover as many of these as possible? But we have only three positions: 1, 2, and 5.

 ""thank"": has T, H, K? K is less common.

 ""stand"": has S, T, D? S is common, T is common, D is common? 

 How about ""stond""? Not a word? 

 How about ""stonk""? Not a word.

 How about ""sting""? But ""sting"": s t i n g -> pattern: 
      position1: s, position2: t, position3: i? -> not A? So we must have A at position3? So ""sting"" doesn't have A at position3? So it's invalid.

 Therefore, I think ""stand"" is a good candidate? 

 But wait, we don't know for sure? Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't have A and N? But we must because they are fixed? We have to include A at position3 and N at position4? So we must.

 Therefore, I choose ""stand"". 

 Let's write: 
   <guess>stand</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  
- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓)  
- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓)  
- C, R, and E are absent (x)  

The secret word must have the pattern `_ _ A N _`, where the first, second, and fifth letters are *not* C, R, or E.  

For the next guess, I prioritized **testing common unused letters** (like S, T, and D) while maintaining the confirmed A (3rd) and N (4th) positions. Selecting ""stand"" allows us to:  
- Test S at position 1  
- Test T at position 2  
- Test D at position 5  

This helps probe multiple untested common consonants efficiently.

<guess>stand</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the second guess: ""stand"" -> S(x), T(x), A(✓), N(✓), D(x)
 This tells us:
   - A and N are still correctly placed at positions 3 and 4? Specifically, A at position 3 and N at position 4? Yes, same as before? But note the pattern does not change? 
   - We now know that S, T, and D are also not in the word? So the secret word does not contain S, T, or D.

 Previously, we knew it doesn't contain C, R, E? 
 And now, added S, T, D? So absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, D.

 Present letters: 
   We only know A (at position 3) and N (at position 4)? And no new letters? 

 So the secret word pattern is: _ _ A N _ 
   - The first letter must be one of the remaining letters (not C,R,E,S,T,D) -> excludes these six.
   - The second letter must be one of the remaining letters (same exclusion).
   - The fifth letter must be one of the remaining letters.

 We must choose a word that:
   - Has the pattern: ? ? A N ?
   - Does not contain C,R,E,S,T,D? 
   - And uses new letters to get more information.

 Since A and N are fixed? We cannot change them? They must be at positions 3 and 4? 

 How many possibilities? What letters are available? 
   Letters available: 
     Not excluded: 
        A,B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? 
        But A and N are already in the word? They might be used? But we don't know if duplicates? 
        However, we haven't had any indication of duplicates? 

 Steps:
   We need to test other common letters? The most common remaining are O, I, L, U, M, P, etc.

 Pattern: 
   Position1: any letter except C,R,E,S,T,D
   Position2: same exclusion? 
   Position3: A (fixed) 
   Position4: N (fixed) 
   Position5: any letter except C,R,E,S,T,D

 How about choosing a word that uses as many new common letters as possible? 

 Example words? 
   - ""plain"": p l a i n -> but ""plain"" is: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)? But wait, our pattern requires N at position4? But plain has I at position4 and N at position5? So that doesn't fit? 

   We require the third letter to be A and the fourth letter to be N? So the word must be: [letter1][letter2] A N [letter5] -> so the last letter? 

   Words that work? 
     - ""urban"": u r b a n -> wait: 
          u(1), r(2)? But R is excluded? -> no.
     - ""woman"": w o m a n -> positions: 
          w(1), o(2), m(3), a(4), n(5)? -> but our pattern requires A at position3 and N at position4? So why would the third letter be A? In ""woman"", the third letter is M? 

     So we need the third letter to be A and the fourth to be N? 

     How about ""koan""? But that's 4 letters? 

     5-letter words? 
        ""pagan""? p a g a n -> positions: p(1), a(2), g(3), a(4), n(5) -> has A at position2 and4? But doesn't have A at position3? 
        ""organ"": o r g a n -> R excluded? 
        ""viral"": not matching pattern? 

     ""grain"": g r a i n -> but R excluded? 

     ""chain"": c h a i n -> C excluded? 

     ""brain"": b r a i n -> R excluded? 

     ""train"": t r a i n -> T excluded? 

     ""plain"": but wait, if we break down: 
          P at1, L at2, A at3 -> then the fourth letter must be N? But ""plain"" has I at4 and N at5? So the pattern mismatch? 

     Alternatively, we can have words like: 
          ""awning"": too long? 

     What about ""cran"" something? But we must have 5 letters? 

     Actually, let's list 5-letter words with A as the third letter and N as the fourth letter? 

        ? ? A N ? -> so the word ends with AN but not at the end? Actually, AN is the third and fourth? Then the fifth letter is after N? 

        Examples: 
          - ""stand"" -> we tried and now excluded? 
          - ""thank"" -> but T and H? T is excluded? 
          - ""blank"" -> B L A N K -> but B, L, K are still possible? However, we haven't tested? And it doesn't contain excluded letters? 

        But wait, we haven't tested B, L, K? 

        However, we know T is excluded? So ""thank"" is invalid because T is excluded? Similarly, ""stank"" has S and T? Also invalid? 

        ""flank"": f l a n k -> contains F, L, K? Which we haven't tested? 
        ""blank"": b l a n k -> B, L, K? 
        ""plank"": p l a n k -> P, L, K? 
        ""clank"": but C is excluded? 
        ""slank"" not a word? 

        Also, words ending in AN? 
          ""human"": h u m a n -> pattern: h(1), u(2), m(3), a(4), n(5) -> but we need A at position3? So no? 
          ""woman"": same? 

        Or ""ocean"": o c e a n -> but has C? 

        How about ""again""? a g a i n -> positions: a(1), g(2), a(3), i(4), n(5) -> but we need the fourth letter to be N? This has i at4 and n at5? So no? 

        But wait, what about ""begin""? b e g i n -> has E? excluded? 

        We must stick to the pattern: the third letter is A and the fourth is N? 

        So we consider: 
          flank, plank, blank, clank (invalid because of C), skank? But skank has S and K? S excluded so invalid? 

        Also, ""think"" but that has T? excluded? 

        Another word: ""wanna""? But that's 5? w a n n a? positions: w(1), a(2), n(3), n(4), a(5)? -> pattern: third letter? n? not A? 

        How about ""wanza""? Not a word? 

        Another: ""kbang""? Not a word? 

        Valid ones: 
          flank, plank, blank? 

        So let's think: 
          flank: f(1), l(2), a(3), n(4), k(5) -> fits pattern? and letters: F,L,A,N,K? 
          A and N we know? But we don't know F,L,K? 

        Similarly, blank: B,L,A,N,K? -> and plank: P,L,A,N,K? 

        We don't have information about these? 

        Also, a word like ""manga"": m a n g a? pattern: m(1), a(2), n(3), g(4), a(5) -> third letter is N? not A? So doesn't work? 

        How about ""kana""? 4 letters? 

        So possibilities? 
          flank, blank, plank, spank (has S? excluded), stank (excluded because T), thank (T excluded), shank (S excluded)? 

        Actually, shank: s has been excluded? 

        So we have: flank, blank, plank? 

        Also, let me think? ""xanadu""? too long? 

        Another: ""vanda""? v a n d a? -> but has D? and pattern: third letter? D? wait: 
          v(1), a(2), n(3), d(4), a(5) -> but we need A at the third? So no? 

        ""bhang""? b h a n g? -> pattern: b(1), h(2), a(3), n(4), g(5)? -> so yes? 

        And ""bhang"" is a word? Yes? I'll assume it is? 

        Also, ""lang"" no? 

        But let's use a more common word? 

        We are going with: flank, plank, blank? 

        How about words starting with vowels? 
          ""again"" -> doesn't fit? 
          ""ocean"" -> doesn't fit and has C? 
          ""aeons"" -> doesn't have the pattern? 

        So we'll choose from flank, plank, blank? 

        We want to test multiple new letters? 

        But note: we have limited guesses? And we haven't tested several letters? 

        Alternatively, we might choose a word that does not have L? Because if we choose one? 

        How about ""banal""? but pattern: b a n a l? positions: 
          b(1), a(2), n(3), a(4), l(5) -> but we require A at position3? So this has A at position2? => doesn't fit? 

        Another: ""cab"" something? All too short? 

        Actually, let's list possible words again: 
          ""graan"" not a word? 
          ""craic"" not a word and has C? 
          ""kyang""? but I don't know? 

        Maybe it's better to pick a word that tests common letters? 

        Let me choose ""blank""? It has B, L, K? 

        But note: we have positions 1,2,5? 

        So if we guess ""blank"": 
           Position1: B -> if it's correct? or at least in the word? 
           Position2: L -> test L? 
           Position5: K -> test K? 

        Alternatively, ""plank"" tests P, L, K? 

        Which one is better? 

        Common letters? 
           In English, L is more common than P? But K is about the same? 

        But B is more common than P? Actually, P is more common? 

        According to frequency: 
           E T A O I N S H R D L U ... 
           Now, E,T,R,A,O,I,N,S,H,D,L ... 

          Since E,T,R are eliminated? The next common: A (known), O, I, N (known), S (out), H (not tested), D (out), L ... 

        So maybe we test O, I, H? 

        But problem: we have to form a word that fits the pattern? And we cannot put O or I or H at position1 or 2? 

        How about words like ""khans"" has S and T? not? 

        What about ""oaths"" ... pattern doesn't match? 

        Alternatively, we can avoid putting any of B, P, and test a word with H? 

        Example: ""whang""? w h a n g -> 
           positions: w(1), h(2), a(3), n(4), g(5) -> fits pattern? 
           and uses W, H, G? 

        But we haven't tested H? W? G? 

        How about ""khans""? s at the end? excluded? 

        ""whang"" is a word? Yes? 

        Also, ""bhais"" not? 

        Another: ""shank"" -> invalid because S? 

        How about ""thank"" -> T? invalid? 

        So ""whang""? 

        Or ""chank""? C? excluded? 

        So possible words: 
          flank (F,L,K), blank (B,L,K), plank (P,L,K), whang (W,H,G), hang? too short? 

        ""whang"" is 5 letters: w h a n g -> so yes? 

        We need to choose one? 

        How about ""human"" ... no? 

        Another: ""paean""? p a e a n? -> but has E? excluded? 

        So? 

        I think ""whang"" is a good candidate? Because H is very common? 

        Or also, how about ""laugh""? l a u g h -> but pattern: l(1), a(2), u(3)? doesn't have A at position3? So invalid? 

        Alternatively, we can use ""again"" ... doesn't fit? 

        What about ""aaron""? It's 5? But has two A's? But pattern: a(1), a(2), r(3) ...? -> no? 

        Another: ""japan""? j a p a n -> positions: j(1), a(2), p(3), a(4), n(5) -> third letter is P? not A? 

        So yes, the words with the pattern ...AN... as the third and fourth letter are limited? 

        We'll choose ""whang"": 
          w at position1: test w? 
          h at position2: test h? 
          g at position5: test g? 

        And avoid F,L,K,B,P? 

        But if the secret is ""flank"" or ""blank""? We don't know? 

        Alternatively, we choose ""flank"" to test F,L,K? 

        How about we choose a word that uses multiple high-frequency remaining letters? 

        High frequency letters not tested? 
          O, I, L, U, H, ... 

        Unfortunately, they are hard to fit? 

        Another word: ""clang"" -> C excluded? 

        ""yangs"" has S? 

        ""bhang"": b h a n g -> 
           position: b(1), h(2), a(3), n(4), g(5) -> fits? 
           but we haven't tested B, H, G? 

        So which word? 

        Let me choose ""bhang""? Or ""whang""? 

        Since we have few options? I'll go with ""blank"" as it has common letters? But B, L, K? 

        But let's remember: we are at the third guess? And we have 3 more? 

        Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat letters? But we have to put A and N? 

        We have no duplicate letters? 

        Let me choose ""flank""? Why? 
          It has F, L, and K? Not tested? 
          And F is less common? Maybe we can eliminate? 

        But note: we don't know? 

        How about we choose ""piano""? But pattern? p i a n o -> 
           position: p(1), i(2), a(3), n(4), o(5) -> perfect! 
           But wait, does it contain an o? Yes? 
           And it doesn't have any excluded letters? 

        And how? 
          Letters: P,I,A,N,O 
          Excluded: C,R,E,S,T,D -> P,I,O are new? 

        But ""piano"" uses A and N at the right positions? 

        Also, it tests P at1, I at2, O at5? 

        This is brilliant? We didn't think of ""piano""? 

        Why didn't we? Because the pattern: ...A N..? And ""piano"": 
           Piano: P-I-A-N-O -> 
              P (1), I (2), A (3), N (4), O (5) -> matches the pattern? 

        And this doesn't use L or K? It uses P, I, O? 

        And I, O are vowels? Common? 

        So ""piano"" is a valid word? 

        So I'll choose ""piano"" as my guess? 

        This way, we test three new common letters? 

        Alternatively, ""frown"" ... but not matching pattern? 

        So yes: 
            <guess>piano</guess>Based on feedback:  
- **""crane""**: A(✓) in position 3 and N(✓) in position 4, with C/R/E absent (x) → pattern `? ? A N ?`, excluding C/R/E.  
- **""stand""**: S(x), T(x), D(x) confirmed absent → pattern remains `? ? A N ?`, now excluding C/R/E/S/T/D.  

Available letters: A,B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding known absent letters).  

**Strategy**:  
- Test common unused letters (e.g., O, I, L) while keeping A/N in positions 3/4.  
- ""piano"" fits perfectly: P/I/O new letters, A/N fixed. Tests:  
  - P at position 1  
  - I at position 2  
  - O at position 5  

""piano"" maximizes coverage of high-frequency letters (I/O) and probes key positions efficiently.

It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(✓), E(x)\n This tells us:\n   - A and N are in the secret word and in the correct positions. Specifically, A is the 3rd letter and N is the 4th letter (since ""crane"" is positions 1:C, 2:R, 3:A, 4:N, 5:E).\n   - The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.\n\n Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ _ A N _\n\n We know the word has A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.\n\n We also know that the letters C, R, and E are absent.\n\n For our next guess, we need to:\n   - Keep A in the 3rd position and N in the 4th position.\n   - Avoid using any of the letters C, R, E.\n\n We also want to test new common letters to narrow down possibilities.\n\n Since A and N are fixed, the word is ? ? A N ?\n\n We don\'t know the 1st, 2nd, and 5th letters, and they must be from the remaining alphabet excluding C, R, E.\n\n Common letters we might try: we can try words that have other vowels and common consonants.\n\n What words fit the pattern _ _ A N _ and do not contain C, R, E?\n Let\'s think of possible words: \n   - We might consider ""urban"": U in 1st, R in 2nd? But wait, R is in the feedback as not present (x). So we must avoid R. So ""urban"" is invalid because it contains R.\n   - ""man"" at the end? Words like ""laugh"" but no, because the pattern is fixed at A in 3rd and N in 4th.\n\n Actually, the pattern must have the 3rd letter A and 4th letter N, so:\n   ... A N ...\n\n Words: \n   - plain? p l A i n -> but n is already the 4th? wait, ""plain"" has ""a"" at position 3? Let\'s see: positions: 1:p, 2:l, 3:a, 4:i, 5:n -> that doesn\'t match because we need N at position 4, but ""plain"" has i at 4 and n at 5.\n\n We need exactly: position1=?, position2=?, position3=A, position4=N, position5=?\n\n So the word ends with the 4th letter as N? Not necessarily, because we have one more letter after N? Actually, no: we have A at 3 and N at 4. Then there is the 5th letter.\n\n Example words: \n   - ""train"": t at1, r at2 -> but R is excluded, so no.\n   - ""chain"": c at1 -> C is excluded, so no.\n   - ""again"": a at1 -> but we can try? But note: we have to avoid using E, R, C? And ""again"" has A at 1 which we don\'t know if it\'s allowed? Actually, we can have A as the first letter? But note that we have no information about A in the first position? However, we already have an A at position 3, so if there is another A, that\'s possible? But the feedback did not indicate two A\'s. However, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicate letters explicitly? \n\n But note the feedback rules: \n   - In feedback, if a letter appears multiple times, it can be tricky. However, in this case, the first guess ""crane"" only had one A and it was in the correct position. So if the word has two A\'s, the other A might be marked as absent or present? Actually, the feedback would show the occurrence only if it exists? \n\n Let me clarify: \n   - The secret word is BRISK. We guessed ""crane"": \n        C is not in BRISK -> x\n        R is in BRISK? Actually, BRISK has R at the second position? But in ""crane"", R is at the second position. However, the secret word BRISK has R at position 2? Then why was R marked as (x)? ... Wait, let\'s look back at the example.\n\n Wait, the example in the initial instructions used BRISK and STORM: \n   STORM: S(-) because S is in the word but not at position 1 (since secret has S at position 4?).\n\n But in our feedback for ""crane"": \n   C was absent -> correct because BRISK doesn\'t have C.\n   R: in ""crane"" is at position 2. The secret BRISK has R at position 2? Then why is R(x) in the feedback? \n\n Actually, wait we are not solving ""BRISK"", we are solving a new word. The example was just an example. So let\'s not confuse.\n\n We have feedback for ""crane"": \n   C(x) -> not in word.\n   R(x) -> not in word? So the secret word does not contain R at all?\n   A(✓) -> in the word and in position 3.\n   N(✓) -> in the word and in position 4.\n   E(x) -> not in word.\n\n Therefore, the secret word has no R, no C, no E.\n\n Now, coming back to our pattern: _ _ A N _\n\n We must choose a word that:\n   - Has the form: [any letter except C,R,E] [any letter except C,R,E] A N [any letter except C,R,E]\n\n Let\'s think of words ending with ""AN"" but note the pattern is fixed: 3rd letter A, 4th letter N.\n\n So the word must be: ? + ? + A + N + ?\n\n Possibilities: \n   - The first letter: any consonant or vowel except C,R,E.\n   - The second letter: similarly.\n   - The fifth letter: similarly.\n\n Some words that fit: \n   - ""stand"": s(t) a(n) d -> wait: \n        s at position1, t at position2, then position3 is a? Actually, ""stand"": s (1), t (2), a (3), n (4), d (5). \n        And stand: letters: s, t, a, n, d -> none of C,R,E. So it\'s valid.\n   - ""handy"": h(1), a(2) -> wait, no: because position3 must be A? But ""handy"": h, a, n, d, y -> positions: 1:h, 2:a, 3:n -> doesn\'t have A at 3 and N at 4? So not matching.\n\n Also, ""panic"": p a n i c -> positions: 1:p, 2:a, 3:n -> so the a is at position2 and n at position3? Not A at position3 and N at position4.\n\n We need: \n   position1: ?\n   position2: ?\n   position3: A\n   position4: N\n   position5: ?\n\n So words like:\n   - ""ocean"": o c e a n -> But we have a at position4? Wait: \n        o (1), c (2), e (3), a (4), n (5) -> pattern A at 4? Not at 3. So no.\n\n How about ""plain""? As I thought earlier: \n   p (1), l (2), a (3), i (4), n (5) -> but wait, position4 is i, not N? And position5 is n? That\'s not matching because we need position4 to be N.\n\n We need position4 to be N. So the pattern must have ...A as the third letter and N as the fourth? Then fifth letter is free.\n\n Valid words:\n   - ""urban"": u(1), r(2), b(3)? Wait: urban: u (1), r (2), b (3), a (4), n (5)? No. That\'s not matching.\n\n Actually:\n\n   We need: \n      letter3: A\n      letter4: N\n\n So the word must be: \n      [1] [2] A N [5]\n\n So: \n      stand: s(1) t(2) a(3) n(4) d(5) -> valid.\n      mania? m a n i a -> no: because positions: m(1), a(2), n(3), i(4), a(5) -> doesn\'t have A at 3? It has n at 3.\n\n How about ""vanish"": but vanish is 6 letters? No, 6 letters? ""vanish"" is 5? \n      v a n i s h -> that\'s 6? Actually, 5: v,a,n,i,sh? Wait, no: vanish is 5 letters? v,a,n,i,sh? \n      Actually: V-A-N-I-S-H -> 6 letters? So let\'s stick to 5.\n\n Let me list 5-letter words that have A as the third and N as the fourth letter:\n   - ""stand"": s t a n d\n   - ""thank"": t h a n k\n   - ""stank"": s t a n k\n   - ""black""? b l a c k -> but c is excluded? But we\'ll avoid C anyway? Oh, C is excluded? The feedback says C(x) -> so we cannot use C? \n        But ""black"" has C? So skip.\n   - ""clank""? Now, C and also we don\'t know if L is allowed? But we already know C is excluded? So invalid.\n\n What about ""bland"": b l a n d -> But we haven\'t tested B and L? And D is also not known.\n\n However, we also need to test new letters? So let\'s choose a word that gives us more information? We don\'t have information on the vowels? Or consonants? \n\n We know A and N are fixed. So we must fill in positions 1,2,5.\n\n Since we have three positions to figure out, and we have 4 remaining guesses? Actually, we are at the second guess.\n\n We can choose a word that uses common letters for positions 1,2,5.\n\n Common letters to test: maybe S, T, L, D, K, etc.\n\n But note: we want to avoid C, R, E.\n\n Let me consider ""stand"": it has S, T, D? Also, if we guess ""stand"", we test S at position1, T at position2, and D at position5.\n\n Alternatively, ""thank"" would test T, H, K.\n\n Another option: ""dance""? But ""dance"": \n      d(1), a(2), n(3) -> wait, that doesn\'t match because we need A at position3? \n      ""dance"": D at1, a at2, n at position3? Then what about the rest? We need A at position3? \n      And our pattern is: _ _ A N _ -> so position2 is not A? \n\n So ""dance"" would not work because position3 is n? Actually:\n      d a n c e -> pattern: \n        position3: n -> not A? And position4: c? Not N? \n\n So we cannot use ""dance"" because it doesn\'t have A at position3 and N at position4? We must have A at 3 and N at 4.\n\n Back to possibilities: \n   - ""stand"": s t a n d -> good.\n   - ""thank"": t h a n k -> good.\n   - ""stank"": s t a n k -> good.\n   - ""shank"": s h a n k -> good.\n   - ""swank"": s w a n k -> good.\n   - ""brand"": but b r a n d -> contains r? R is excluded? So no.\n\n We also have ""plain""? No, because plain has pattern: p l a i n -> which is p(1), l(2), a(3), i(4), n(5) -> but we need n at position4? Here position4 is i -> not matching.\n\n We need exactly: ...A N at positions 3 and 4.\n\n So the pattern is: ??AN?\n\n We\'ll choose one that helps test common letters? \n\n Let\'s choose ""stand"". It has S, T, D? We haven\'t tested S, T, D? And we know A and N are already fixed.\n\n But note: in the pattern, the A and N are fixed, so we are testing the first two letters and the last.\n\n However, if we guess ""stand"", we might get:\n\n   If the secret word is ""stand"": all correct? We don\'t know.\n\n   If the secret word has S at 1? Or not? We can learn.\n\n Alternatively, maybe we choose a word that doesn\'t repeat letters we already know? We know A and N are present? But we are forced to put them in positions 3 and 4? So we are testing the other positions.\n\n But we must include A and N at those positions? So we are stuck? \n\n However, note: we have to use only valid words. \n\n Another idea: we can test other vowels or common consonants? \n\n Let me try to list common letters we haven\'t tested: \n   We tried C,R,A,N,E -> so A and N are known. C, R, E are out.\n\n   We haven\'t tested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We can choose a word that uses multiple new common letters? \n\n The most common letters in English are E (we know absent), T, A (known), O, I, N (known), S, H, R (absent), D, L, U.\n\n So of the top, we can test T, O, I, S, H, D, L, U.\n\n We can try to cover as many of these as possible? But we have only three positions: 1, 2, and 5.\n\n ""thank"": has T, H, K? K is less common.\n\n ""stand"": has S, T, D? S is common, T is common, D is common? \n\n How about ""stond""? Not a word? \n\n How about ""stonk""? Not a word.\n\n How about ""sting""? But ""sting"": s t i n g -> pattern: \n      position1: s, position2: t, position3: i? -> not A? So we must have A at position3? So ""sting"" doesn\'t have A at position3? So it\'s invalid.\n\n Therefore, I think ""stand"" is a good candidate? \n\n But wait, we don\'t know for sure? Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t have A and N? But we must because they are fixed? We have to include A at position3 and N at position4? So we must.\n\n Therefore, I choose ""stand"". \n\n Let\'s write: \n   <guess>stand</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":  \n- A is correct and in the 3rd position (✓)  \n- N is correct and in the 4th position (✓)  \n- C, R, and E are absent (x)  \n\nThe secret word must have the pattern `_ _ A N _`, where the first, second, and fifth letters are *not* C, R, or E.  \n\nFor the next guess, I prioritized **testing common unused letters** (like S, T, and D) while maintaining the confirmed A (3rd) and N (4th) positions. Selecting ""stand"" allows us to:  \n- Test S at position 1  \n- Test T at position 2  \n- Test D at position 5  \n\nThis helps probe multiple untested common consonants efficiently.\n\n<guess>stand</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the second guess: ""stand"" -> S(x), T(x), A(✓), N(✓), D(x)\n This tells us:\n   - A and N are still correctly placed at positions 3 and 4? Specifically, A at position 3 and N at position 4? Yes, same as before? But note the pattern does not change? \n   - We now know that S, T, and D are also not in the word? So the secret word does not contain S, T, or D.\n\n Previously, we knew it doesn\'t contain C, R, E? \n And now, added S, T, D? So absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, D.\n\n Present letters: \n   We only know A (at position 3) and N (at position 4)?

But wait, our pattern requires N at position4? But plain has I at position4 and N at position5? So that doesn\'t fit? \n\n   We require the third letter to be A and the fourth letter to be N?

But that\'s 4 letters? \n\n     5-letter words? \n        ""pagan""? p a g a n -> positions: p(1), a(2), g(3), a(4), n(5) -> has A at position2 and4?

But ""plain"" has I at4 and N at5? So the pattern mismatch? \n\n     Alternatively, we can have words like: \n          ""awning"": too long? \n\n     What about ""cran"" something? But we must have 5 letters? \n\n     Actually, let\'s list 5-letter words with A as the third letter and N as the fourth letter? \n\n        ? ? A N ? -> so the word ends with AN but not at the end? Actually, AN is the third and fourth? Then the fifth letter is after N? \n\n        Examples: \n          - ""stand"" -> we tried and now excluded? \n          - ""thank"" -> but T and H? T is excluded? \n          - ""blank"" -> B L A N K -> but B, L, K are still possible? However, we haven\'t tested?

Similarly, ""stank"" has S and T? Also invalid? \n\n        ""flank"": f l a n k -> contains F, L, K?

But skank has S and K? S excluded so invalid? \n\n        Also, ""think"" but that has T? excluded? \n\n        Another word: ""wanna""? But that\'s 5? w a n n a? positions: w(1), a(2), n(3), n(4), a(5)? -> pattern: third letter? n? not A? \n\n        How about ""wanza""? Not a word? \n\n        Another: ""kbang""? Not a word? \n\n        Valid ones: \n          flank, plank, blank? \n\n        So let\'s think: \n          flank: f(1), l(2), a(3), n(4), k(5) -> fits pattern? and letters: F,L,A,N,K? \n          A and N we know?

So doesn\'t work? \n\n        How about ""kana""? 4 letters? \n\n        So possibilities? \n          flank, blank, plank, spank (has S? excluded), stank (excluded because T), thank (T excluded), shank (S excluded)? \n\n        Actually, shank: s has been excluded? \n\n        So we have: flank, blank, plank? \n\n        Also, let me think? ""xanadu""? too long? \n\n        Another: ""vanda""? v a n d a? -> but has D? and pattern: third letter? D? wait: \n          v(1), a(2), n(3), d(4), a(5) -> but we need A at the third?

And we haven\'t tested several letters? \n\n        Alternatively, we might choose a word that does not have L? Because if we choose one? \n\n        How about ""banal""? but pattern: b a n a l? positions: \n          b(1), a(2), n(3), a(4), l(5) -> but we require A at position3? So this has A at position2? => doesn\'t fit? \n\n        Another: ""cab"" something? All too short? \n\n        Actually, let\'s list possible words again: \n          ""graan"" not a word? \n          ""craic"" not a word and has C? \n          ""kyang""? but I don\'t know? \n\n        Maybe it\'s better to pick a word that tests common letters? \n\n        Let me choose ""blank""? It has B, L, K? \n\n        But note: we have positions 1,2,5? \n\n        So if we guess ""blank"": \n           Position1: B -> if it\'s correct? or at least in the word? \n           Position2: L -> test L? \n           Position5: K -> test K? \n\n        Alternatively, ""plank"" tests P, L, K? \n\n        Which one is better? \n\n        Common letters? \n           In English, L is more common than P? But K is about the same? \n\n        But B is more common than P? Actually, P is more common? \n\n        According to frequency: \n           E T A O I N S H R D L U ... \n           Now, E,T,R,A,O,I,N,S,H,D,L ... \n\n          Since E,T,R are eliminated? The next common: A (known), O, I, N (known), S (out), H (not tested), D (out), L ... \n\n        So maybe we test O, I, H? \n\n        But problem: we have to form a word that fits the pattern? And we cannot put O or I or H at position1 or 2? \n\n        How about words like ""khans"" has S and T? not? \n\n        What about ""oaths"" ... pattern doesn\'t match? \n\n        Alternatively, we can avoid putting any of B, P, and test a word with H? \n\n        Example: ""whang""? w h a n g -> \n           positions: w(1), h(2), a(3), n(4), g(5) -> fits pattern? \n           and uses W, H, G? \n\n        But we haven\'t tested H? W? G? \n\n        How about ""khans""? s at the end? excluded? \n\n        ""whang"" is a word? Yes? \n\n        Also, ""bhais"" not? \n\n        Another: ""shank"" -> invalid because S? \n\n        How about ""thank"" -> T? invalid? \n\n        So ""whang""? \n\n        Or ""chank""? C? excluded? \n\n        So possible words: \n          flank (F,L,K), blank (B,L,K), plank (P,L,K), whang (W,H,G), hang? too short? \n\n        ""whang"" is 5 letters: w h a n g -> so yes? \n\n        We need to choose one? \n\n        How about ""human"" ... no? \n\n        Another: ""paean""? p a e a n? -> but has E? excluded? \n\n        So? \n\n        I think ""whang"" is a good candidate? Because H is very common? \n\n        Or also, how about ""laugh""? l a u g h -> but pattern: l(1), a(2), u(3)? doesn\'t have A at position3? So invalid? \n\n        Alternatively, we can use ""again"" ... doesn\'t fit? \n\n        What about ""aaron""? It\'s 5? But has two A\'s? But pattern: a(1), a(2), r(3) ...? -> no? \n\n        Another: ""japan""? j a p a n -> positions: j(1), a(2), p(3), a(4), n(5) -> third letter is P? not A? \n\n        So yes, the words with the pattern ...AN... as the third and fourth letter are limited? \n\n        We\'ll choose ""whang"": \n          w at position1: test w? \n          h at position2: test h? \n          g at position5: test g? \n\n        And avoid F,L,K,B,P? \n\n        But if the secret is ""flank"" or ""blank""? We don\'t know? \n\n        Alternatively, we choose ""flank"" to test F,L,K? \n\n        How about we choose a word that uses multiple high-frequency remaining letters? \n\n        High frequency letters not tested? \n          O, I, L, U, H, ... \n\n        Unfortunately, they are hard to fit? \n\n        Another word: ""clang"" -> C excluded? \n\n        ""yangs"" has S? \n\n        ""bhang"": b h a n g -> \n           position: b(1), h(2), a(3), n(4), g(5) -> fits? \n           but we haven\'t tested B, H, G? \n\n        So which word? \n\n        Let me choose ""bhang""? Or ""whang""? \n\n        Since we have few options? I\'ll go with ""blank"" as it has common letters? But B, L, K? \n\n        But let\'s remember: we are at the third guess? And we have 3 more? \n\n        Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t repeat letters? But we have to put A and N? \n\n        We have no duplicate letters? \n\n        Let me choose ""flank""? Why? \n          It has F, L, and K? Not tested? \n          And F is less common? Maybe we can eliminate? \n\n        But note: we don\'t know? \n\n        How about we choose ""piano""? But pattern? p i a n o -> \n           position: p(1), i(2), a(3), n(4), o(5) -> perfect! \n           But wait, does it contain an o? Yes? \n           And it doesn\'t have any excluded letters? \n\n        And how? \n          Letters: P,I,A,N,O \n          Excluded: C,R,E,S,T,D -> P,I,O are new? \n\n        But ""piano"" uses A and N at the right positions? \n\n        Also, it tests P at1, I at2, O at5? \n\n        This is brilliant? We didn\'t think of ""piano""? \n\n        Why didn\'t we? Because the pattern: ...A N..? And ""piano"": \n           Piano: P-I-A-N-O -> \n              P (1), I (2), A (3), N (4), O (5) -> matches the pattern? \n\n        And this doesn\'t use L or K? It uses P, I, O? \n\n        And I, O are vowels? Common? \n\n        So ""piano"" is a valid word? \n\n        So I\'ll choose ""piano"" as my guess? \n\n        This way, we test three new common letters? \n\n        Alternatively, ""frown"" ... but not matching pattern? \n\n        So yes: \n            <guess>piano</guess>Based on feedback:  \n- **""crane""**: A(✓) in position 3 and N(✓) in position 4, with C/R/E absent (x) → pattern `? ? A N ?`, excluding C/R/E.  \n- **""stand""**: S(x), T(x), D(x) confirmed absent → pattern remains `? ? A N ?`, now excluding C/R/E/S/T/D.  \n\nAvailable letters: A,B,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (excluding known absent letters).  \n\n**Strategy**:  \n- Test common unused letters (e.g., O, I, L) while keeping A/N in positions 3/4.  \n- ""piano"" fits perfectly: P/I/O new letters, A/N fixed. Tests:  \n  - P at position 1  \n  - I at position 2  \n  - O at position 5  \n\n""piano"" maximizes coverage of high-frequency letters (I/O) and probes key positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>piano</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: stand -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(x)\nGuess 3: piano -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) I(x) A(✓) N(✓) O(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess: ""piano"" -> P(✓), I(x), A(✓), N(✓), O(x)
 This tells us:
   - P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - I is not in the word at all (x).
   - A is in the correct position (position 3).
   - N is in the correct position (position 4).
   - O is not in the word at all (x).

 Therefore, we now know:
   - The secret word starts with P (since P is correct at position 1).
   - The third letter is A and the fourth is N (fixed).
   - The word does not contain I or O (and also not C, R, E, S, T, D from previous feedback).

 So the pattern is: P _ A N _ 

 And the absent letters are: C, R, E, S, T, D, I, O.

 We need to find a word that fits: P ? A N ? 
   - The second letter must be a letter not in the absent list.
   - The fifth letter must be a letter not in the absent list.

 Also, we know the word has P at the start, A at 3, N at 4.

 What letters are available for the second and fifth positions?
   Available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to choose a word that tests common letters? 

 Possibilities for the word:
   - The second letter: we can try a common consonant or vowel? But vowels left: U, and sometimes Y? 
   - The fifth letter: similarly.

 Example words:
   - ""pagan"": but we have P at1, A at2? But our pattern requires the third letter to be A? 
        ""pagan"": P(1), A(2), G(3), A(4), N(5) -> doesn't match because we need A at position3? 
        Also, it has A at2 and G at3? Not matching.

   - ""paean"": but has E? excluded? 

   - ""plain"": but has I? excluded? 

   - ""prank"": has R? excluded? 

   - ""plank"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) -> fits? 
        And L and K are available? 

   - ""plank"" is a valid word? Yes.

   - ""flank"" doesn't start with P? 

   - ""thank"" has T? excluded? 

   - ""blank"" doesn't start with P? 

   - ""cramp"" has C? excluded? 

   - ""prawn"" has R? excluded? 

   - ""spawn"" has S? excluded? 

   - ""yawn"" too short? 

   - ""pagan"" as above? doesn't fit? 

   - ""human"" doesn't start with P? 

   - ""panic"": has I? excluded? 

   - ""panic"" also doesn't have A at position3? 

   - ""panda"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> but we need A at position3? This has A at2 and N at3? Not matching.

   - ""panty"": P(1), A(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is excluded? 

   - ""pansy"": P(1), A(2), N(3), S(4), Y(5) -> S excluded? 

   - ""panel"": has E? excluded? 

   - ""papal"": P(1), A(2), P(3), A(4), L(5) -> but position3 is P? not A? 

   - ""patio"": has T and O? excluded?

   - ""payed"": has E and D? excluded? 

   - ""pekan"": has E? excluded? 

   - ""penal"": has E? excluded? 

   - ""peony"": has E and O? excluded? 

   - ""pekan"" not? 

   - ""piano"" we already tried? 

   - ""picky"": has I? excluded? 

   - ""pinky"": has I? excluded? 

   - ""pinto"": has I and O? excluded? 

   - ""pylon"": has O? excluded? 

   - ""punch"": has U? but also N? but pattern: P(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) -> but we need A at position3? 

   - ""punch"" has N at position3? Not A? 

   - ""parch"": has R? excluded? 

   - ""pasha"": P(1), A(2), S(3), H(4), A(5) -> S excluded? 

   - ""pasta"": has S? excluded? 

   - ""pasty"": has S? excluded? 

   - ""patch"": has T? excluded?

   - ""piano"" we did? 

   - ""pique"": has E? 

   - ""place"": has L? but also C? excluded? 

   - ""plage"": has E? 

   - ""plane"": has E? 

   - ""plank"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) -> fits the pattern? 
        And L and K are not excluded? 

   - ""plank"" is a word? Yes.

   - ""plans"": has S? excluded? 

   - ""plant"": has T? excluded? 

   - ""plash"": has S? 

   - ""plasm"": has S? 

   - ""plate"": has T and E? 

   - ""platy"": has T? 

   - ""playa"": has Y? but pattern: P(1), L(2), A(3), Y(4)? -> but we need N at position4? 

   - ""plaza"": has Z? but pattern: P(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4)? -> not N? 

   - ""plead"": has E and D? 

   - ""pleas"": has E and S? 

   - ""plena"": has E? 

   - ""plink"": has I? 

   - ""plonk"": has O? 

   - ""pluck"": has U? 

   - ""plumb"": has U? 

   - ""plume"": has E? 

   - ""plump"": has U? 

   - ""plunk"": has U? 

   - ""poach"": has O? 

   - ""prawn"": has R? 

   - ""preen"": has R and E? 

   - ""prink"": has R? 

   - ""proud"": has R and U? 

   - ""prune"": has R and E? 

   - ""puffy"": has U? 

   - ""pukka"": has U? 

   - ""pulka"": has U? 

   - ""punch"": has U? 

   - ""puppy"": has U? 

   - ""pylon"": has O? 

   - ""pyran"": not a word? 

   - ""pyxie"": has I? 

   So, ""plank"" seems to be a valid option? 

   Also, ""plank"" uses L and K? 

   Another possibility: ""pagan"" doesn't fit? 

   What about ""pagan"" with two A's? But we need A at position3? 

   How about ""panga"": P(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), A(5) -> but we need A at position3? This has N at position3? 

   So no? 

   Another: ""pawaw""? not a word? 

   ""pawky"" doesn't have A at3? 

   ""pawky"": P(1), A(2), W(3), K(4), Y(5) -> position3 is W? 

   So not? 

   ""pawaw"" not? 

   ""pawls"" has S? 

   ""pawns"" has S? 

   ""payed"" has E? 

   ""pekan"" has E? 

   ""pelfs"" has E? 

   ""penal"" has E? 

   ""peril"" has E? 

   ""pibal""? not?

   ""pikau""? not? 

   ""pikul"" has I?

   ""pilar"" has R? 

   ""pilau"" has I? 

   ""pilea"" has I? 

   ""pinas"" has S?

   ""plaid"" has D? 

   ""plain"" has I? 

   ""plait"" has T? 

   ""plane"" has E? 

   ""plank"" is the only one we found? 

   But wait, what about ""prawn""? has R? 

   ""prank"" has R? 

   ""punch"" has U? and doesn't have A at3? 

   So ""plank"" seems to be a good candidate? 

   But note: we have to avoid I and O? and ""plank"" doesn't have them? 

   Also, we can test ""plank"": 
        If we guess ""plank"", we test L at position2 and K at position5? 

   Alternatively, we can try ""plum""? not 5? 

   Or ""plump""? has U? 

   How about ""plaza""? but position4 is Z? not N? 

   Another word: ""pavan""? but we need A at3? 

   ""pavan"": P(1), A(2), V(3), A(4), N(5) -> position3 is V? 

   So no? 

   ""pawky"" as above? 

   ""pawky"" is a word? But position3 is W? 

   So I think ""plank"" is the best? 

   But let's check if there are others? 

   What about ""pagan""? no? 

   ""panga"": P(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), A(5) -> but we need A at position3? This has N at position3? 

   So no? 

   ""panga"" is a word? But it doesn't fit the pattern? 

   How about ""panda""? P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> but D is excluded? 

   ""panda"" has D? 

   ""pandy""? has D? 

   ""paned""? has E and D? 

   ""panel""? has E? 

   ""panne""? has E?

   Or ""pawky"" doesn't fit? 

   So I'll go with ""plank"". 

   Guess: plank
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Pattern Confirmed**: The secret word has the pattern `P _ A N _` (P in position 1, A in position 3, N in position 4).
- **Absent Letters**: C, R, E, S, T, D, I, O (from feedback on ""crane"", ""stand"", and ""piano"").
- **Present/Correct Letters**: P (position 1), A (position 3), N (position 4).

For the next guess:
- The word must start with P, have A in position 3, N in position 4, and avoid absent letters.
- Available letters for positions 2 and 5: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- ""plank"" fits perfectly:  
  - P (position 1, confirmed ✓)  
  - L (position 2, tests a new common consonant)  
  - A (position 3, fixed ✓)  
  - N (position 4, fixed ✓)  
  - K (position 5, tests a new consonant)  

This tests high-frequency letters (L, K) and narrows possibilities efficiently.

<guess>plank</guess>",plank,"We have feedback from the third guess: ""piano"" -> P(✓), I(x), A(✓), N(✓), O(x)
 This tells us:
   - P is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
   - I is not in the word at all (x).
   - A is in the correct position (position 3).
   - N is in the correct position (position 4).
   - O is not in the word at all (x).

 Therefore, we now know:
   - The secret word starts with P (since P is correct at position 1).
   - The third letter is A and the fourth is N (fixed).
   - The word does not contain I or O (and also not C, R, E, S, T, D from previous feedback).

 So the pattern is: P _ A N _ 

 And the absent letters are: C, R, E, S, T, D, I, O.

 We need to find a word that fits: P ? A N ? 
   - The second letter must be a letter not in the absent list.
   - The fifth letter must be a letter not in the absent list.

 Also, we know the word has P at the start, A at 3, N at 4.

 What letters are available for the second and fifth positions?
   Available: B, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We need to choose a word that tests common letters? 

 Possibilities for the word:
   - The second letter: we can try a common consonant or vowel? But vowels left: U, and sometimes Y? 
   - The fifth letter: similarly.

 Example words:
   - ""pagan"": but we have P at1, A at2? But our pattern requires the third letter to be A? 
        ""pagan"": P(1), A(2), G(3), A(4), N(5) -> doesn't match because we need A at position3? 
        Also, it has A at2 and G at3? Not matching.

   - ""paean"": but has E? excluded? 

   - ""plain"": but has I? excluded? 

   - ""prank"": has R? excluded? 

   - ""plank"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) -> fits?

   - ""yawn"" too short? 

   - ""pagan"" as above? doesn't fit? 

   - ""human"" doesn't start with P? 

   - ""panic"": has I? excluded? 

   - ""panic"" also doesn't have A at position3? 

   - ""panda"": P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> but we need A at position3? This has A at2 and N at3? Not matching.

   - ""panty"": P(1), A(2), N(3), T(4), Y(5) -> but T is excluded? 

   - ""pansy"": P(1), A(2), N(3), S(4), Y(5) -> S excluded? 

   - ""panel"": has E? excluded? 

   - ""papal"": P(1), A(2), P(3), A(4), L(5) -> but position3 is P? not A?

   - ""penal"": has E? excluded?

   - ""picky"": has I? excluded? 

   - ""pinky"": has I? excluded? 

   - ""pinto"": has I and O? excluded? 

   - ""pylon"": has O? excluded? 

   - ""punch"": has U? but also N? but pattern: P(1), U(2), N(3), C(4), H(5) -> but we need A at position3? 

   - ""punch"" has N at position3? Not A? 

   - ""parch"": has R? excluded? 

   - ""pasha"": P(1), A(2), S(3), H(4), A(5) -> S excluded? 

   - ""pasta"": has S? excluded?

   - ""patch"": has T? excluded?

   - ""piano"" we did? 

   - ""pique"": has E? 

   - ""place"": has L? but also C? excluded? 

   - ""plage"": has E? 

   - ""plane"": has E? 

   - ""plank"": P(1), L(2), A(3), N(4), K(5) -> fits the pattern? 
        And L and K are not excluded? 

   - ""plank"" is a word? Yes.

   - ""plans"": has S? excluded? 

   - ""plant"": has T? excluded? 

   - ""plash"": has S? 

   - ""plasm"": has S? 

   - ""plate"": has T and E? 

   - ""platy"": has T? 

   - ""playa"": has Y? but pattern: P(1), L(2), A(3), Y(4)? -> but we need N at position4? 

   - ""plaza"": has Z? but pattern: P(1), L(2), A(3), Z(4)? -> not N? 

   - ""plead"": has E and D? 

   - ""pleas"": has E and S? 

   - ""plena"": has E? 

   - ""plink"": has I? 

   - ""plonk"": has O? 

   - ""pluck"": has U? 

   - ""plumb"": has U? 

   - ""plume"": has E? 

   - ""plump"": has U? 

   - ""plunk"": has U? 

   - ""poach"": has O? 

   - ""prawn"": has R? 

   - ""preen"": has R and E? 

   - ""prink"": has R? 

   - ""proud"": has R and U? 

   - ""prune"": has R and E? 

   - ""puffy"": has U? 

   - ""pukka"": has U? 

   - ""pulka"": has U? 

   - ""punch"": has U? 

   - ""puppy"": has U? 

   - ""pylon"": has O? 

   - ""pyran"": not a word? 

   - ""pyxie"": has I? 

   So, ""plank"" seems to be a valid option? 

   Also, ""plank"" uses L and K? 

   Another possibility: ""pagan"" doesn't fit? 

   What about ""pagan"" with two A's? But we need A at position3? 

   How about ""panga"": P(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), A(5) -> but we need A at position3? This has N at position3? 

   So no? 

   Another: ""pawaw""? not a word? 

   ""pawky"" doesn't have A at3? 

   ""pawky"": P(1), A(2), W(3), K(4), Y(5) -> position3 is W? 

   So not? 

   ""pawaw"" not? 

   ""pawls"" has S? 

   ""pawns"" has S? 

   ""payed"" has E? 

   ""pekan"" has E? 

   ""pelfs"" has E? 

   ""penal"" has E? 

   ""peril"" has E? 

   ""pibal""? not? 

   ""pical"" has I? 

   ""pikas"" has S? 

   ""pikau""? not? 

   ""pikul"" has I? 

   ""pilaf"" has I? 

   ""pilar"" has R? 

   ""pilau"" has I? 

   ""pilea"" has I? 

   ""pinas"" has S? 

   ""pinch"" has I? 

   ""pinda""? not? 

   ""pings"" has S? 

   ""pinko"" has I and O? 

   ""pinky"" has I? 

   ""pinta"" has T? 

   ""pinto"" has I and O? 

   ""pions"" has O? 

   ""pipal"" has I? 

   ""pique"" has E? 

   ""pirai"" has I? 

   ""pisco"" has I? 

   ""piste"" has E? 

   ""pitas"" has S? 

   ""pitch"" has T?

   ""pizza"" has I? 

   ""plack"" has C? 

   ""plage"" has E? 

   ""plaid"" has D? 

   ""plain"" has I? 

   ""plait"" has T? 

   ""plane"" has E? 

   ""plank"" is the only one we found? 

   But wait, what about ""prawn""? has R? 

   ""prank"" has R? 

   ""punch"" has U? and doesn't have A at3? 

   So ""plank"" seems to be a good candidate? 

   But note: we have to avoid I and O? and ""plank"" doesn't have them? 

   Also, we can test ""plank"": 
        If we guess ""plank"", we test L at position2 and K at position5? 

   Alternatively, we can try ""plum""? not 5? 

   Or ""plump""? has U? 

   How about ""plaza""? but position4 is Z? not N? 

   Another word: ""pavan""? but we need A at3? 

   ""pavan"": P(1), A(2), V(3), A(4), N(5) -> position3 is V? 

   So no? 

   ""pawky"" as above? 

   ""pawky"" is a word? But position3 is W? 

   So I think ""plank"" is the best? 

   But let's check if there are others? 

   What about ""pagan""? no? 

   ""panga"": P(1), A(2), N(3), G(4), A(5) -> but we need A at position3? This has N at position3? 

   So no? 

   ""panga"" is a word? But it doesn't fit the pattern? 

   How about ""panda""? P(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), A(5) -> but D is excluded? 

   ""panda"" has D? 

   ""pandy""? has D? 

   ""paned""? has E and D? 

   ""panel""? has E? 

   ""panne""? has E? 

   ""pansy""? has S? 

   ""panty""? has T? 

   ""papaw""? P(1), A(2), P(3), A(4), W(5) -> position3 is P?

   So I think ""plank"" is the only common word? 

   Therefore, I'll guess ""plank"". 

   But note: we have to consider that the fifth letter might be something else? 

   For example, what if the word is ""plang""? but ""plang"" is not a common word?

   So ""plank"" is the best?

   Or ""pawky"" doesn't fit? 

   So I'll go with ""plank"".
