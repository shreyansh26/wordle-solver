 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

We are starting with the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback was all 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think about common letters that are left. The English alphabet has 26 letters. We have excluded 5: C, R, A, N, E.

 Remaining consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z
 Remaining vowels: I, O, U (since A and E are excluded, and sometimes Y)

 We should try to include some of the most common remaining letters. Common letters in English include: T, S, L, O, etc.

 Let's try to form a word with the remaining common letters.

 Possible words: 
   We could try ""TOILS"" but that has S and I, but we don't know if they are in the word? Actually, we don't have any information yet except the exclusions.

 However, note that we must avoid C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's consider:
   ""SLOTH"": S, L, O, T, H -> all new letters, and common.
   ""PIOUS"": P, I, O, U, S -> again, all new.

 But we want to maximize information. We might also consider words that have a good mix of vowels and consonants.

 Another idea: ""HOIST"" - H, O, I, S, T.

 However, we have to make sure the word is valid.

 Since we have no correct letters, we are free to choose any word without the excluded letters.

 Let me choose ""SLOTH"" because it uses S, L, O, T, H which are common and we haven't tried them.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a common word: M, O, I, S, T. But note that we haven't excluded M.

 However, we must avoid E, A, R, N, C.

 ""MOIST"" does not contain any of the excluded letters? Let's check: M, O, I, S, T. None of these are C, R, A, N, E. So it's valid.

 But note: we have 6 tries, and we are on the second guess. We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Another candidate: ""BUMPY"" - but that has Y and is 5 letters? Actually, ""BUMPY"" is 5 letters, but we have B, U, M, P, Y. However, Y is less common and we might want to use more frequent letters.

 Let's look at letter frequency in English (without the excluded ones):

   Most common remaining: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 We can try to use a word that has T, O, S, L, and one more.

 But 5 letters: how about ""TOILS""? T, O, I, L, S -> all new.

 However, I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T. M is also a common consonant.

 Alternatively, ""PILOT"" has P, I, L, O, T. But we already considered.

 I think I'll go with ""MOIST"".

 So, the next guess is ""moist"".

 But note: the feedback for the first guess was all wrong, so we are starting fresh with new letters.

 Let me confirm: the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 Therefore, I choose ""moist"".

<guess>moist</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as absent (x), I need to choose a new 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely. My goal is to test common letters not yet attempted, focusing on high-frequency consonants like S, T, L, M and vowels like O, I. 

After eliminating C, R, A, N, E, strong candidates include words like ""moist"" (testing M, O, I, S, T) or ""pilot"" (testing P, I, L, O, T). I selected ""moist"" because it:
- Uses 5 new, high-frequency letters

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters are absent (x): so C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
2. ""moist"" -> feedback: M(-), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(-)

- O is not in the word (so we can exclude O).
- I is in the word but not in the third position.
- S is not in the word (so exclude S).
- T is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, O, S.

Letters that must be in the word: M, I, T (each appeared in the feedback as '-' meaning present but wrong position).

M was in position 1 in the guess but it's wrong, so M cannot be in position 1.
I was in position 3 but wrong, so I cannot be in position 3.
T was in position 5 but wrong, so T cannot be in position 5.

Since M, I, T are in the word, and we have three positions to place them (but not the positions we tried).

We have 5 positions. We know:
- Position 1: cannot be M (because M was in position 1 and got '-')
- Position 3: cannot be I
- Position 5: cannot be T

The word is 5 letters, and we know it contains M, I, T and two other letters that we don't know yet.

We also have excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and also M, I, T are in, but we need two more).

We need to form a word that has M, I, T and two more letters from the available set.

The positions for M, I, T cannot be 1 for M, 3 for I, 5 for T.

Possible positions:
- M can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 we know T is not there, but M could be? Yes, since T is not in 5, M might be in 5? But we don't know.

Actually, from feedback, we only know the specific positions that are incorrect for each letter. So:
- M cannot be in position 1, but it can be in 2,3,4,5.
- I cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1,2,4,5.
- T cannot be in position 5, so it can be in 1,2,3,4.

Now, we also know that O and S are not in the word.

We need to think of words that have M, I, T and two other letters not in the excluded list.

Common words? Let's list possibilities:

The word must include M, I, T.

Possible structures:

1. M in position 2, T in position 4, I in position 1? For example, ""IMT..."" but that might not form a word.

We need actual words.

Let's consider words containing M, I, T.

Possible words:
- ""MITES"" -> but S is excluded, so no.
- ""MILTY"" -> not a common word? 
- ""TIMID"" -> has I and M, but we have T and I and M? TIMID: T, I, M, I, D -> but it has two I's? And D is allowed.
But let's check letters: T, I, M, I, D. Excluded letters? We excluded C,R,A,N,E,O,S. D is not excluded. But we need to see if the word is valid.

However, we have feedback that I is present, but in TIMID it appears twice? The feedback doesn't say if there are duplicates. So possibly.

But we have to make a guess that tests new letters.

Alternatively, ""LIMIT"" -> L, I, M, I, T. But again two I's? And L is allowed.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, in the feedback for ""moist"" we only had one I and it was marked present, but if the word had two I's, we wouldn't know. But for now, let's assume we can have words with duplicates.

But let's avoid duplicates if possible to maximize information.

Another word: ""ADMIT"" -> but A is excluded? A is in the first exclusion list. So no.

""COMMIT"" has C and O? Excluded.

""PERMIT"" has P, E, R? E and R are excluded.

""SUMMIT"" has S and U? S is excluded.

So we need words without C,R,A,N,E,O,S and containing M, I, T.

Let's try words that start with T? Because T can be in position 1.

Possible: 
- ""TIGER"" -> T,I,G,E,R? But E and R are excluded. No.
- ""TILDE"" -> E excluded. No.
- ""TIDAL"" -> A excluded. No.
- ""TIMID"" -> T,I,M,I,D. D is allowed? But has two I's? 
  Letters: T, I, M, I, D -> valid? And D is new.

But let's see: we haven't tried D. Also, we know I is in the word, but in TIMID, I appears in positions 2 and 4. The feedback from ""moist"" only said I is present but not in position 3, so it could be in 1,2,4, or 5. TIMID has I in 2 and 4.

Another word: ""GUILD"" -> G,U,I,L,D? But does it have M? No, we need M.

We must have M.

""DELIM"" -> D,E,L,I,M? E excluded.

""BEFIT"" -> B,E,F,I,T? E excluded.

""JUMBY"" -> J,U,M,B,Y? Does it have I? No.

We must have all three: M, I, T.

Another word: ""MITTS"" -> S excluded? Also, has two T's? T in position 1 and 5? But we know T can't be in 5? Wait, secret word: if it has T in position 1 and another T? But in our feedback, T cannot be in position 5? But it could be in 1.

""MITTS"" has two T's, so if we guess, we might get feedback for one T.

But S is excluded, so not valid.

""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y? But no M.

We need M.

Another word: ""HUMIT"" -> not valid? I think ""HUMIT"" is not common.

""LIMIT"" -> L,I,M,I,T. This has L and I and M and T. Letters: L,I,M,I,T? So duplicates. But L is new.

We can try ""LIMIT"".

But let's think about the position constraints:

In ""LIMIT"": 
- Position 1: L (we don't know if it is okay)
- Position 2: I -> but I must be in the word, and cannot be in position 3? In ""LIMIT"", I is in 2 and 4. 
But we are going to test: if L is in the word, and M and T.

But note: M was in position 3? In ""LIMIT"", M is in position 3. But in the feedback for ""moist"", M was in position 1 and got wrong position? Meaning M is in the word but not in 1, so it could be in 3? Similarly, in ""LIMIT"", I is in position 2 and 4, and T is in position 5.

But T is in position 5: we know from feedback that T cannot be in position 5? So ""LIMIT"" has T in position 5, which is not allowed because the feedback T(-) at position 5 means T is not in position 5? Actually, the feedback says T is in the word but not in position 5? So if we put T in position 5 again, we know it will be wrong.

Therefore, we cannot guess ""LIMIT"" because it puts T in position 5 which is known to be incorrect.

Similarly, we must put T in 1,2,3, or 4.

So in our next guess, T cannot be in position 5.

Similarly, M cannot be in position 1, and I cannot be in position 3.

So let's think of words that have M, I, T and two other letters, with the constraints:
- T not in 5
- M not in 1
- I not in 3

And the word does not contain C,R,A,N,E,O,S.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Let's try to form words:

Option: T in position 1? Then the word is T ? ? ? ?

We need I and M. And I not in 3, so I could be in 2,4, or 5? But T is in 1.

Also M not in 1.

Possible: T I M ? ? -> but then what? If I in 2, M in 3, then we have positions 4 and 5.

But remember I cannot be in position 3? We have I in 2? That's okay.

Then word: T I M ? ?

Possible words: 
  ""TIMID"" -> T,I,M,I,D -> I in position 2 and 4, M in position 3? Then position 5: D.
  ""TIMED"" -> but E excluded? No.
  ""TIMID"" is valid? Now check: M is in position 3? Is that allowed? The constraint for M: M cannot be in position 1? But here it is in 3? No constraint against 3.

Actually, M can be in position 3? Because the feedback only said it wasn't in 1? So yes.

Similarly, I is in position 2: which is allowed since only position 3 is forbidden for I.

And T is in position 1: which is allowed (T can be in 1).

So ""TIMID"" might be a candidate.

But does it have duplicate I? That might be acceptable.

Another word: ""THUMB"" -> T,H,U,M,B? Does it have I? No, missing I.

We must include I.

""TIDY"" -> only 4 letters? Not 5.

""TILTH"" -> T,I,L,T,H? Has two T's? And no M? T,I,L,T,H? But M is not in it? We need M.

Not valid because missing M.

""VIPER"" -> V,I,P,E,R? E excluded? No.

So back to ""TIMID"": T,I,M,I,D.

But D is a new letter we haven't tried.

Alternatively, is there a word without duplicates?

For example, ""MIGHT"" -> M,I,G,H,T? Letters: M,I,G,H,T. T in position 5? But T cannot be in position 5? In ""MIGHT"", T is in position 5? So not allowed.

How about ""GIMPY"" -> G,I,M,P,Y? Does it have T? No.

We need T.

Another possibility: put I in position 1.

Word: I ? ? ? ?

But I in position 1? That's allowed.

Then? M and T must be somewhere.

For example, I M T ? ? -> ""IMT..."" not a word.

I ? M ? ? T -> but T not in 5? If we put T at the end? No, T cannot be in 5? So T must be in the middle.

Example: ""INPUT"" -> I,N,P,U,T? But N is excluded? We cannot use N.

""INPUT"" has N which is excluded.

""IMPEL"" -> I,M,P,E,L? E excluded? No.

""IDYLL"" -> not valid? And no T.

Hard to find a word starting with I containing M and T.

Put M in position 2? For example, ? M ? ? ?

But then we need to place I and T.

Perhaps a word like ""DUTY"" -> too short.

Another idea: ""UMTIL"" -> not a word.

List of words containing M,I,T: 
  ""ADMIT"" (A excluded)
  ""AMBIT"" (A excluded)
  ""ADMIT"" excluded
  ""AMNIO"" (has A, O excluded) no
  ""ANIMI"" plural of animus? But has A and N? Excluded.
  ""BEMUD"" not containing T
  ""BEFIT"" E excluded
  ""COMMIT"" O and C excluded
  ""DEMIT"" E excluded
  ""DEBIT"" E excluded
  ""DIMLY"" D,I,M,L,Y? No T.
  ""DELIM"" E excluded
  ""EMIT"" with E? No
  ""FJORD"" not M,I,T.

This is difficult. Perhaps ""LIMPT"" not a word.

""TIMED"" with E? Excluded.

So ""TIMID"" might be one of the few choices.

Another word: ""MITCH"" has C? Excluded? C is excluded.

""HUMIT"" not word? 

""WIDTH"" -> W,I,D,T,H? But does it have M? No.

""PITY"" -> not 5.

So we might have to go with ""TIMID"" or similar.

But in ""TIMID"", we have I at position 2 and 4? The secret word may have one I or two. We don't know.

Another word: ""QUIMT"" not a word.

Or ""GUIMP"" not.

Perhaps ""MIXTY"" not word.

Maybe ""MIDST"" -> but S excluded? S is excluded.

So ""TIMID"" seems acceptable.

But note: in ""TIMID"", position 3 is M? And from ""moist"" guess, we got I(-) at position 3? No, we got I at position 3 in ""moist"" was incorrect? Actually, in ""moist"", I was at position 3 and got ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? So I is in the word but not at position 3? So ""TIMID"" has I at position 2 and 4, not at 3? That's fine? Position 3 is M, which is okay.

Also, T is at position 1, which should be okay? But in ""moist"", we had T at position 5? And now at position 1? That's different? We are testing T at position 1? Which is allowed because T can be in 1.

Similarly, M is at position 3? Previously M was at position 1? Now position 3? Should be okay.

Also, D is a new letter.

So I'll guess ""TIMID"".

But let me see if we can try a word with new letters.

We are using T, I, M, I, D? We are testing D and also T in position 1, M in 3.

Alternatively, we can use other words? 

Another word: ""MULCT"" -> M,U,L,C,T? C is excluded? Yes, C excluded? No.

C is excluded? From initial: crane had C as absent? Yes.

So not.

""TIMED"" E excluded.

So ""TIMID"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning shy or timid.

So I think that's a good guess.

Therefore, our third guess: ""timid"".

But let's double-check the feedback constraints:
- M must not be in position 1: satisfied, because M is at position 3? ""TIMID"" positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:M, 4:I, 5:D.
- I must not be in position 3: satisfied? Yes, because I is in position 2 and 4, not 3.
- T must not be in position 5: satisfied? Yes, T is at position 1.

And we are testing D, which is new.

Also, the word avoids excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,O,S.

So, guess ""timid"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these are excluded.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**:
  - M is present (-) but not in position 1.
  - O is absent (x), so O is excluded.
  - I is present (-) but not in position 3.
  - S is absent (x), so S is excluded.
  - T is present (-) but not in position 5.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word contains M, I, and T (all marked as present in the second guess).
- M cannot be in position 1, I cannot be in position 3, and T cannot be in position 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus M, I, T which are confirmed).

For the next guess:
- I prioritize testing M, I, T in new positions to refine their locations.
- I need to include two new letters to gather more information.
- After considering options like ""LIMIT"" (discarded due to T in position 5, which is invalid) and other combinations, ""TIMID"" fits:
  - Positions: T in 1 (valid, not forbidden), I in 2 (valid, since I cannot be in 3), M in 3 (valid, since M cannot be in 1), I in 4, D in 5.
  - Tests T in position 1 (new slot), M in position 3 (new slot), and I with a possible duplicate (position 4).
  - Introduces D (new letter).
  - Avoids excluded letters.
- This guess maximizes information on letter placements and tests a frequent letter (D).

<guess>timid</guess>",timid,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters are absent (x): so C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
2. ""moist"" -> feedback: M(-), O(x), I(-), S(x), T(-)

This means:
- M is in the word but not in the first position.
- O is not in the word (so we can exclude O).
- I is in the word but not in the third position.
- S is not in the word (so exclude S).
- T is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Also, we know the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, O, S.

Letters that must be in the word: M, I, T (each appeared in the feedback as '-' meaning present but wrong position).

M was in position 1 in the guess but it's wrong, so M cannot be in position 1.
I was in position 3 but wrong, so I cannot be in position 3.
T was in position 5 but wrong, so T cannot be in position 5.

Since M, I, T are in the word, and we have three positions to place them (but not the positions we tried).

We have 5 positions. We know:
- Position 1: cannot be M (because M was in position 1 and got '-')
- Position 3: cannot be I
- Position 5: cannot be T

The word is 5 letters, and we know it contains M, I, T and two other letters that we don't know yet.

We also have excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and also M, I, T are in, but we need two more).

We need to form a word that has M, I, T and two more letters from the available set.

The positions for M, I, T cannot be 1 for M, 3 for I, 5 for T.

Possible positions:
- M can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5? But position 5 we know T is not there, but M could be? Yes, since T is not in 5, M might be in 5? But we don't know.

Actually, from feedback, we only know the specific positions that are incorrect for each letter. So:
- M cannot be in position 1, but it can be in 2,3,4,5.
- I cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1,2,4,5.
- T cannot be in position 5, so it can be in 1,2,3,4.

Now, we also know that O and S are not in the word.

We need to think of words that have M, I, T and two other letters not in the excluded list.

Common words? Let's list possibilities:

The word must include M, I, T.

Possible structures:

1. M in position 2, T in position 4, I in position 1? For example, ""IMT..."" but that might not form a word.

We need actual words.

Let's consider words containing M, I, T.

Possible words:
- ""MITES"" -> but S is excluded, so no.
- ""MILTY"" -> not a common word? 
- ""TIMID"" -> has I and M, but we have T and I and M? TIMID: T, I, M, I, D -> but it has two I's? And D is allowed.
But let's check letters: T, I, M, I, D. Excluded letters? We excluded C,R,A,N,E,O,S. D is not excluded. But we need to see if the word is valid.

However, we have feedback that I is present, but in TIMID it appears twice? The feedback doesn't say if there are duplicates. So possibly.

But we have to make a guess that tests new letters.

Alternatively, ""LIMIT"" -> L, I, M, I, T. But again two I's? And L is allowed.

But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters. However, in the feedback for ""moist"" we only had one I and it was marked present, but if the word had two I's, we wouldn't know. But for now, let's assume we can have words with duplicates.

But let's avoid duplicates if possible to maximize information.

Another word: ""ADMIT"" -> but A is excluded? A is in the first exclusion list. So no.

""COMMIT"" has C and O? Excluded.

""PERMIT"" has P, E, R? E and R are excluded.

""SUMMIT"" has S and U? S is excluded.

So we need words without C,R,A,N,E,O,S and containing M, I, T.

Let's try words that start with T? Because T can be in position 1.

Possible: 
- ""TIGER"" -> T,I,G,E,R? But E and R are excluded. No.
- ""TILDE"" -> E excluded. No.
- ""TIDAL"" -> A excluded. No.
- ""TIMID"" -> T,I,M,I,D. D is allowed? But has two I's? 
  Letters: T, I, M, I, D -> valid? And D is new.

But let's see: we haven't tried D. Also, we know I is in the word, but in TIMID, I appears in positions 2 and 4. The feedback from ""moist"" only said I is present but not in position 3, so it could be in 1,2,4, or 5. TIMID has I in 2 and 4.

Another word: ""GUILD"" -> G,U,I,L,D? But does it have M? No, we need M.

We must have M.

""DELIM"" -> D,E,L,I,M? E excluded.

""BEFIT"" -> B,E,F,I,T? E excluded.

""JUMBY"" -> J,U,M,B,Y? Does it have I? No.

We must have all three: M, I, T.

Another word: ""MITTS"" -> S excluded? Also, has two T's? T in position 1 and 5? But we know T can't be in 5? Wait, secret word: if it has T in position 1 and another T? But in our feedback, T cannot be in position 5? But it could be in 1.

""MITTS"" has two T's, so if we guess, we might get feedback for one T.

But S is excluded, so not valid.

""KITTY"" -> K,I,T,T,Y? But no M.

We need M.

Another word: ""HUMIT"" -> not valid? I think ""HUMIT"" is not common.

""LIMIT"" -> L,I,M,I,T. This has L and I and M and T. Letters: L,I,M,I,T? So duplicates. But L is new.

We can try ""LIMIT"".

But let's think about the position constraints:

In ""LIMIT"": 
- Position 1: L (we don't know if it is okay)
- Position 2: I -> but I must be in the word, and cannot be in position 3? In ""LIMIT"", I is in 2 and 4. 
But we are going to test: if L is in the word, and M and T.

But note: M was in position 3? In ""LIMIT"", M is in position 3. But in the feedback for ""moist"", M was in position 1 and got wrong position? Meaning M is in the word but not in 1, so it could be in 3? Similarly, in ""LIMIT"", I is in position 2 and 4, and T is in position 5.

But T is in position 5: we know from feedback that T cannot be in position 5? So ""LIMIT"" has T in position 5, which is not allowed because the feedback T(-) at position 5 means T is not in position 5? Actually, the feedback says T is in the word but not in position 5? So if we put T in position 5 again, we know it will be wrong.

Therefore, we cannot guess ""LIMIT"" because it puts T in position 5 which is known to be incorrect.

Similarly, we must put T in 1,2,3, or 4.

So in our next guess, T cannot be in position 5.

Similarly, M cannot be in position 1, and I cannot be in position 3.

So let's think of words that have M, I, T and two other letters, with the constraints:
- T not in 5
- M not in 1
- I not in 3

And the word does not contain C,R,A,N,E,O,S.

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Let's try to form words:

Option: T in position 1? Then the word is T ? ? ? ?

We need I and M. And I not in 3, so I could be in 2,4, or 5? But T is in 1.

Also M not in 1.

Possible: T I M ? ? -> but then what? If I in 2, M in 3, then we have positions 4 and 5.

But remember I cannot be in position 3? We have I in 2? That's okay.

Then word: T I M ? ?

Possible words: 
  ""TIMID"" -> T,I,M,I,D -> I in position 2 and 4, M in position 3? Then position 5: D.
  ""TIMED"" -> but E excluded? No.
  ""TIMID"" is valid? Now check: M is in position 3? Is that allowed? The constraint for M: M cannot be in position 1? But here it is in 3? No constraint against 3.

Actually, M can be in position 3? Because the feedback only said it wasn't in 1? So yes.

Similarly, I is in position 2: which is allowed since only position 3 is forbidden for I.

And T is in position 1: which is allowed (T can be in 1).

So ""TIMID"" might be a candidate.

But does it have duplicate I? That might be acceptable.

Another word: ""THUMB"" -> T,H,U,M,B? Does it have I? No, missing I.

We must include I.

""TIDY"" -> only 4 letters? Not 5.

""TILTH"" -> T,I,L,T,H? Has two T's? And no M? T,I,L,T,H? But M is not in it? We need M.

Not valid because missing M.

""VIPER"" -> V,I,P,E,R? E excluded? No.

So back to ""TIMID"": T,I,M,I,D.

But D is a new letter we haven't tried.

Alternatively, is there a word without duplicates?

For example, ""MIGHT"" -> M,I,G,H,T? Letters: M,I,G,H,T. T in position 5? But T cannot be in position 5? In ""MIGHT"", T is in position 5? So not allowed.

How about ""GIMPY"" -> G,I,M,P,Y? Does it have T? No.

We need T.

Another possibility: put I in position 1.

Word: I ? ? ? ?

But I in position 1? That's allowed.

Then? M and T must be somewhere.

For example, I M T ? ? -> ""IMT..."" not a word.

I ? M ? ? T -> but T not in 5? If we put T at the end? No, T cannot be in 5? So T must be in the middle.

Example: ""INPUT"" -> I,N,P,U,T? But N is excluded? We cannot use N.

""INPUT"" has N which is excluded.

""IMPEL"" -> I,M,P,E,L? E excluded? No.

""IDYLL"" -> not valid? And no T.

Hard to find a word starting with I containing M and T.

Put M in position 2? For example, ? M ? ? ?

But then we need to place I and T.

Perhaps a word like ""DUTY"" -> too short.

Another idea: ""UMTIL"" -> not a word.

List of words containing M,I,T: 
  ""ADMIT"" (A excluded)
  ""AMBIT"" (A excluded)
  ""ADMIT"" excluded
  ""AMNIO"" (has A, O excluded) no
  ""ANIMI"" plural of animus? But has A and N? Excluded.
  ""BEMUD"" not containing T
  ""BEFIT"" E excluded
  ""COMMIT"" O and C excluded
  ""DEMIT"" E excluded
  ""DEBIT"" E excluded
  ""DIMLY"" D,I,M,L,Y? No T.
  ""DELIM"" E excluded
  ""EMIT"" with E? No
  ""FJORD"" not M,I,T.

This is difficult. Perhaps ""LIMPT"" not a word.

""TIMED"" with E? Excluded.

So ""TIMID"" might be one of the few choices.

Another word: ""MITCH"" has C? Excluded? C is excluded.

""HUMIT"" not word? 

""WIDTH"" -> W,I,D,T,H? But does it have M? No.

""PITY"" -> not 5.

So we might have to go with ""TIMID"" or similar.

But in ""TIMID"", we have I at position 2 and 4? The secret word may have one I or two. We don't know.

Another word: ""QUIMT"" not a word.

Or ""GUIMP"" not.

Perhaps ""MIXTY"" not word.

Maybe ""MIDST"" -> but S excluded? S is excluded.

So ""TIMID"" seems acceptable.

But note: in ""TIMID"", position 3 is M? And from ""moist"" guess, we got I(-) at position 3? No, we got I at position 3 in ""moist"" was incorrect? Actually, in ""moist"", I was at position 3 and got ""-"" meaning present but wrong position? So I is in the word but not at position 3? So ""TIMID"" has I at position 2 and 4, not at 3? That's fine? Position 3 is M, which is okay.

Also, T is at position 1, which should be okay? But in ""moist"", we had T at position 5? And now at position 1? That's different? We are testing T at position 1? Which is allowed because T can be in 1.

Similarly, M is at position 3? Previously M was at position 1? Now position 3? Should be okay.

Also, D is a new letter.

So I'll guess ""TIMID"".

But let me see if we can try a word with new letters.

We are using T, I, M, I, D? We are testing D and also T in position 1, M in 3.

Alternatively, we can use other words? 

Another word: ""MULCT"" -> M,U,L,C,T? C is excluded? Yes, C excluded? No.

C is excluded? From initial: crane had C as absent? Yes.

So not.

""TIMED"" E excluded.

So ""TIMID"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning shy or timid.

So I think that's a good guess.

Therefore, our third guess: ""timid"".

But let's double-check the feedback constraints:
- M must not be in position 1: satisfied, because M is at position 3? ""TIMID"" positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:M, 4:I, 5:D.
- I must not be in position 3: satisfied? Yes, because I is in position 2 and 4, not 3.
- T must not be in position 5: satisfied? Yes, T is at position 1.

And we are testing D, which is new.

Also, the word avoids excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,O,S.

So, guess ""timid"".Based on the previous feedback:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so these are excluded.
- **Guess 2 (moist)**:
  - M is present (-) but not in position 1.
  - O is absent (x), so O is excluded.
  - I is present (-) but not in position 3.
  - S is absent (x), so S is excluded.
  - T is present (-) but not in position 5.

**Key insights**:
- The secret word contains M, I, and T (all marked as present in the second guess).
- M cannot be in position 1, I cannot be in position 3, and T cannot be in position 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, S.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (plus M, I, T which are confirmed).

For the next guess:
- I prioritize testing M, I, T in new positions to refine their locations.
- I need to include two new letters to gather more information.
- After considering options like ""LIMIT"" (discarded due to T in position 5, which is invalid) and other combinations, ""TIMID"" fits:
  - Positions: T in 1 (valid, not forbidden), I in 2 (valid, since I cannot be in 3), M in 3 (valid, since M cannot be in 1), I in 4, D in 5.
  - Tests T in position 1 (new slot), M in position 3 (new slot), and I with a possible duplicate (position 4).
  - Introduces D (new letter).
  - Avoids excluded letters.
- This guess maximizes information on letter placements and tests a frequent letter (D).",Guess 3: timid -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) I(✓) M(✓) I(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
