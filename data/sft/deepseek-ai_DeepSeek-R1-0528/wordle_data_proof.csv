We have feedback from the first guess:
 ""crane"" -> C: x, R: ✓, A: x, N: x, E: x

 Interpretation:
 - The letter 'R' is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
 - Letters 'C', 'A', 'N', 'E' are not in the secret word at all.

 So, we know:
 - The second letter of the secret word is 'R'.
 - The secret word does not contain the letters: C, A, N, E.

 We have 6 tries, and this is the second try.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Has 'R' in the second position.
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Additionally, we want to try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants besides R (which we already have) include: L, T, S, B, D, etc.
 Common vowels: We know A and E are out, so we can use I, O, U.

 Let's think of words that fit:
   _ R _ _ _

 Since we don't know other letters, we can try to cover more common letters.

 Example words: 
   We could consider ""PRICK"", but we don't know if P is safe? However, from the previous feedback we know that C is not in the word, so we can't use C.

 Actually, we know the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E. So any letter except these.

 Let's list some possibilities:
   Words with R in the second position: brick, bring, brisk, broad, broke, brown, brush, draft, drink, drive, drown, fruit, ... 

 But note: 
   - We cannot use any of the forbidden letters: A, C, N, E.

 Filter:
   brick: B, R, I, C, K -> contains C -> not allowed. Wait, but we know C is not in the word? Actually, we can use a word that has C? 
   But note: the rule says we must guess a valid 5-letter English word. However, using a letter that we know is not in the word (like C) would waste an opportunity to test other letters.

 It's strategically better to use a word that only uses letters that could potentially be in the word. So we avoid C, A, N, E.

 Therefore, ""brick"" is invalid because it has C? Actually, no, we can still use it as a guess? But it would be inefficient because we know C isn't in the word.

 Let me check: the feedback says C is not in the word. So if I guess a word with C, the feedback will show C with an 'x' again, which we already know. It's not giving new information.

 So, I should avoid using C, A, N, E.

 Now, back to words with R in the second position and without C, A, N, E.

 Possible words:
   - Using I: ""BRISK"", ""BRING"" -> but BRING has G? And we don't know about G? Also, BRING has N? N is forbidden -> wait, BRING: letters B,R,I,N,G -> N is forbidden so we cannot use N? Actually, we can use the word even if it contains forbidden letters? Yes, but it's not advised because:

   The game allows any valid English word. However, guessing a word that contains a letter we know is not present will not help us because that letter will get an 'x', and we already know it's not in the word.

   So to maximize information, we should choose a word that uses only letters that are not ruled out and are common.

   Therefore, let's look for words that:
        Position 2: R
        Letters: only from the remaining alphabet (not C, A, N, E)

   Examples:
        Try a word with O: ""BROOD"" -> but has double O? Let's find better ones.

        Better: ""BROAD""? But BROAD has A -> forbidden.

        ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> all allowed? Letters: B, O, I, L are not forbidden? Yes, because forbidden are C, A, N, E. So BROIL is a candidate.

        ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> forbidden? F, R, U, I, T: no forbidden letters.

        ""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> okay.

        ""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> double letter? Also allowed.

    But note: we don't want to repeat the mistake of using a word with double letters unless necessary? Not necessarily bad.

    However, we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

    Let me list common letters we haven't tested: 
        Not used yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

    We have 5 positions: first, third, fourth, fifth.

    We know the second is R.

    We can try to include several of these common letters.

    Common letters to test: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

    Consider ""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M -> but P is not forbidden? And we know R is already in place? However, note that in ""PRISM"", R is in the second position? Yes.

    But wait: we know the second letter is R, so any word we choose must have R as the second letter.

    So let's build:

        First letter: can be any letter except C, A, N, E -> let's choose a common consonant: S, T, B, P, etc.
        Third letter: vowel, e.g., I, O, U? Or consonant? We don't know much.

    Another idea: use a word that has many common letters and R in the second position.

    Some top candidates:

        ""STRIP"": S, T, R, I, P -> but positions: 
            Position1: S, Position2: R? Wait, no: STRIP is S-T-R-I-P -> so R is the third letter? Doesn't work.

    We need R as the second letter.

    So: words like `_ R _ _ _`.

    ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, O, U are new. But double T? It might be inefficient.

    ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> okay.

    ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H -> okay.

    ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> okay.

    ""DRIFT"": D, R, I, F, T -> okay.

    All these avoid C, A, N, E.

    Now, which one gives the most information? 

    We want to maximize the number of common letters we test.

    Let me choose ""BRUSH"": letters B, R, U, S, H.

    Why ""BRUSH""? 
        - B: common consonant
        - U: vowel (since we lost A and E, U might be useful)
        - S: very common
        - H: fairly common

    Alternatively, ""TRIPS"": but T, R, I, P, S -> R is the second? T R I P S -> that works? T (1st), R (2nd), I (3rd), P (4th), S (5th). Yes.

    But note: we know the second letter is R, so we can use any word that has R in the second position.

    ""TRIPS"" is T-R-I-P-S -> that fits.

    However, ""TRIPS"" avoids forbidden letters? T, R, I, P, S -> yes.

    Similarly, ""CRISP"": but C is forbidden -> invalid.

    So, ""TRIPS"" is a candidate.

    Now, comparing ""TRIPS"" vs ""BRUSH"":
        ""TRIPS"": letters: T, R, I, P, S -> all new except R, which we are reusing but that's okay because we know it's correct and we can confirm position? Actually, we already know R is in the correct position, so we expect a ✓ on R again.

        Which one tests more common letters? 
            TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> common letters: T, I, P, S are all common.
            BRUSH: B, R, U, S, H -> B, U, S, H: S is common, B is common, U and H are less common.

        So ""TRIPS"" might be better.

    Also, consider vowel: we haven't tested I or U. I is more common than U.

    Another candidate: ""ORBIT""? But O is in the first position? O-R-B-I-T -> okay, but note O is not forbidden? And we can use it.

    However, I think ""TRIPS"" is solid.

    But wait: the word must have R in the second position. ""ORBIT"": O-R-B-I-T -> so R is second? Yes.

    However, ""TRIPS"" uses the letter T at the beginning and S at the end.

    I decide to go with ""TRIPS"".

    Why not ""DRIVE""? But E is forbidden? Yes, but DRIVE has E -> so invalid.

    So, ""TRIPS"" is valid.

    Let me confirm: 
        T: not C,A,N,E -> okay.
        R: okay (and we know it's in the word and in position 2).
        I: okay.
        P: okay.
        S: okay.

    So ""TRIPS"" is a valid English word without forbidden letters.

    We'll guess ""TRIPS"".

    However, note: if the secret word has any of T, I, P, S, we'll get feedback.

    We hope to get more information.

    Alternatively, we could use a word with O? Like ""PROUD"" (P,R,O,U,D). But U and D are less common? Or ""GROUT""?

    But let's stick with ""TRIPS"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **R** is correct and in the right position (2nd letter).
- **C, A, N, E** are not in the secret word.

For this guess (second attempt):

- I must avoid using **C, A, N, E** to maximize information.
- I prioritized testing new common letters (**T, I, P, S**) while keeping R fixed in position 2.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess:
 ""crane"" -> C: x, R: ✓, A: x, N: x, E: x

 Interpretation:
 - The letter 'R' is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
 - Letters 'C', 'A', 'N', 'E' are not in the secret word at all.

 So, we know:
 - The second letter of the secret word is 'R'.
 - The secret word does not contain the letters: C, A, N, E.

 We have 6 tries, and this is the second try.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Has 'R' in the second position.
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Additionally, we want to try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants besides R (which we already have) include: L, T, S, B, D, etc.
 Common vowels: We know A and E are out, so we can use I, O, U.

 Let's think of words that fit:
   _ R _ _ _

 Since we don't know other letters, we can try to cover more common letters.

 Example words: 
   We could consider ""PRICK"", but we don't know if P is safe? However, from the previous feedback we know that C is not in the word, so we can't use C.

 Actually, we know the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E. So any letter except these.

 Let's list some possibilities:
   Words with R in the second position: brick, bring, brisk, broad, broke, brown, brush, draft, drink, drive, drown, fruit, ... 

 But note: 
   - We cannot use any of the forbidden letters: A, C, N, E.

 Filter:
   brick: B, R, I, C, K -> contains C -> not allowed. Wait, but we know C is not in the word? Actually, we can use a word that has C? 
   But note: the rule says we must guess a valid 5-letter English word. However, using a letter that we know is not in the word (like C) would waste an opportunity to test other letters.

 It's strategically better to use a word that only uses letters that could potentially be in the word. So we avoid C, A, N, E.

 Therefore, ""brick"" is invalid because it has C? Actually, no, we can still use it as a guess? But it would be inefficient because we know C isn't in the word.

 Let me check: the feedback says C is not in the word. So if I guess a word with C, the feedback will show C with an 'x' again, which we already know. It's not giving new information.

 So, I should avoid using C, A, N, E.

 Now, back to words with R in the second position and without C, A, N, E.

 Possible words:
   - Using I: ""BRISK"", ""BRING"" -> but BRING has G? And we don't know about G? Also, BRING has N? N is forbidden -> wait, BRING: letters B,R,I,N,G -> N is forbidden so we cannot use N? Actually, we can use the word even if it contains forbidden letters? Yes, but it's not advised because:

   The game allows any valid English word. However, guessing a word that contains a letter we know is not present will not help us because that letter will get an 'x', and we already know it's not in the word.

   So to maximize information, we should choose a word that uses only letters that are not ruled out and are common.

   Therefore, let's look for words that:
        Position 2: R
        Letters: only from the remaining alphabet (not C, A, N, E)

   Examples:
        Try a word with O: ""BROOD"" -> but has double O? Let's find better ones.

        Better: ""BROAD""? But BROAD has A -> forbidden.

        ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> all allowed? Letters: B, O, I, L are not forbidden? Yes, because forbidden are C, A, N, E. So BROIL is a candidate.

        ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> forbidden? F, R, U, I, T: no forbidden letters.

        ""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> okay.

        ""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> double letter? Also allowed.

    But note: we don't want to repeat the mistake of using a word with double letters unless necessary? Not necessarily bad.

    However, we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

    Let me list common letters we haven't tested: 
        Not used yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

    We have 5 positions: first, third, fourth, fifth.

    We know the second is R.

    We can try to include several of these common letters.

    Common letters to test: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

    Consider ""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M -> but P is not forbidden? And we know R is already in place? However, note that in ""PRISM"", R is in the second position? Yes.

    But wait: we know the second letter is R, so any word we choose must have R as the second letter.

    So let's build:

        First letter: can be any letter except C, A, N, E -> let's choose a common consonant: S, T, B, P, etc.
        Third letter: vowel, e.g., I, O, U? Or consonant? We don't know much.

    Another idea: use a word that has many common letters and R in the second position.

    Some top candidates:

        ""STRIP"": S, T, R, I, P -> but positions: 
            Position1: S, Position2: R? Wait, no: STRIP is S-T-R-I-P -> so R is the third letter? Doesn't work.

    We need R as the second letter.

    So: words like `_ R _ _ _`.

    ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, O, U are new. But double T? It might be inefficient.

    ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> okay.

    ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H -> okay.

    ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> okay.

    ""DRIFT"": D, R, I, F, T -> okay.

    All these avoid C, A, N, E.

    Now, which one gives the most information? 

    We want to maximize the number of common letters we test.

    Let me choose ""BRUSH"": letters B, R, U, S, H.

    Why ""BRUSH""? 
        - B: common consonant
        - U: vowel (since we lost A and E, U might be useful)
        - S: very common
        - H: fairly common

    Alternatively, ""TRIPS"": but T, R, I, P, S -> R is the second? T R I P S -> that works? T (1st), R (2nd), I (3rd), P (4th), S (5th). Yes.

    But note: we know the second letter is R, so we can use any word that has R in the second position.

    ""TRIPS"" is T-R-I-P-S -> that fits.

    However, ""TRIPS"" avoids forbidden letters? T, R, I, P, S -> yes.

    Similarly, ""CRISP"": but C is forbidden -> invalid.

    So, ""TRIPS"" is a candidate.

    Now, comparing ""TRIPS"" vs ""BRUSH"":
        ""TRIPS"": letters: T, R, I, P, S -> all new except R, which we are reusing but that's okay because we know it's correct and we can confirm position? Actually, we already know R is in the correct position, so we expect a ✓ on R again.

        Which one tests more common letters? 
            TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> common letters: T, I, P, S are all common.
            BRUSH: B, R, U, S, H -> B, U, S, H: S is common, B is common, U and H are less common.

        So ""TRIPS"" might be better.

    Also, consider vowel: we haven't tested I or U. I is more common than U.

    Another candidate: ""ORBIT""? But O is in the first position? O-R-B-I-T -> okay, but note O is not forbidden? And we can use it.

    However, I think ""TRIPS"" is solid.

    But wait: the word must have R in the second position. ""ORBIT"": O-R-B-I-T -> so R is second? Yes.

    However, ""TRIPS"" uses the letter T at the beginning and S at the end.

    I decide to go with ""TRIPS"".

    Why not ""DRIVE""? But E is forbidden? Yes, but DRIVE has E -> so invalid.

    So, ""TRIPS"" is valid.

    Let me confirm: 
        T: not C,A,N,E -> okay.
        R: okay (and we know it's in the word and in position 2).
        I: okay.
        P: okay.
        S: okay.

    So ""TRIPS"" is a valid English word without forbidden letters.

    We'll guess ""TRIPS"".

    However, note: if the secret word has any of T, I, P, S, we'll get feedback.

    We hope to get more information.

    Alternatively, we could use a word with O? Like ""PROUD"" (P,R,O,U,D). But U and D are less common? Or ""GROUT""?

    But let's stick with ""TRIPS"".

<guess>trips</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **R** is correct and in the right position (2nd letter).
- **C, A, N, E** are not in the secret word.

For this guess (second attempt):
- I must include **R** in the **second position**.
- I must avoid using **C, A, N, E** to maximize information.
- I prioritized testing new common letters (**T, I, P, S**) while keeping R fixed in position 2.

I chose **""trips""** because:
- It covers frequent consonants (T, P, S) and a vowel (I), all untested.
- It avoids forbidden letters.
- As an English word, it meets game rules.

Next, I'll analyze feedback from this guess to inform my third attempt.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""trips""
- T: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, same as before)
- I: x (not in word)
- P: - (in word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in word)

So, what we know so far:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter P is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since in ""trips"" it was in the fourth and got a dash).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.
- Therefore, the word contains R (at position 2) and P (somewhere not at position 4), and does not contain C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Includes the letter P (but not in the fourth position).
- Avoids the letters: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

Available letters: We can use any letter except the forbidden ones. The forbidden letters are: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

So, the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: P is already known to be in the word, so we should include it.

We also know that P is not in position 4. So in our new guess, we can put P in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but not 4, and position 2 is R).

We want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Common letters among the available ones: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, Y.

We already know P is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? But we need to find its position. So we should try to put P in a different position to test.

Possible positions for P: 1, 3, or 5.

We can also try to cover other vowels. The only vowel left that we haven't tested and is available is O, U, and sometimes Y. We know A, E, I are out.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ R _ _ _

And include P (not in position 4) and avoid forbidden letters.

Some ideas:

- If we put P in position 1: P R _ _ _
  - Then we need to fill the last three positions with available letters (not C,A,N,E,T,I,S) and including other new letters.
  - Example: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> but we have to check: O and U are vowels, D is consonant. But note: we don't know if O or U are in the word? So it's good to test.
  - However, in ""PROUD"", P is at position 1, which is new. And we have O, U, D to test.

- If we put P in position 3: _ R P _ _
  - Example: ""ORPHAN"" -> but H is allowed? Yes, but we have to check the letters: O, R, P, H, A -> A is forbidden! So invalid.
  - Another: ""CRUMP"" -> C is forbidden. Invalid.
  - ""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P -> but P is at position 5? Wait, let's see: position 1: G, 2: R, 3: U, 4: M, 5: P -> so P is at 5, not 3. So that doesn't put P at 3.

  Actually, for position 3: we need a word like _ R P _ _
  Example: ""WRAPS"" -> W, R, A, P, S -> but A and S are forbidden. Invalid.

  Another: ""DRUMP"" is not a word.

  How about ""CRIMP""? C is forbidden.

  It's hard to find a word with P in position 3 without using forbidden letters.

- If we put P in position 5: _ R _ _ P
  Example: ""BROMP"" not a word. ""GRAMP"" not a word. ""FRUMP"" -> F, R, U, M, P -> that's a word? Frump means to be sullen or sulky. It's acceptable? Let me check: yes, it's a valid word.

  But note: we are avoiding forbidden letters? F, R, U, M, P: none of these are forbidden. So ""FRUMP"" is a candidate.

  However, we are testing F, U, M, and P (which we know is in the word, but we are testing its position).

But let's go back to the first option: putting P in position 1.

Candidate: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> letters: P, O, U, D. We know P is in the word, so we are testing O, U, D.

But note: in ""PROUD"", P is at position 1. We don't know if P can be at position 1? It might be, because we only know it's not at position 4.

Another candidate: ""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W, L -> tests O, W, L.

But we have to avoid S, which we are.

Another: ""PROBE"" -> but E is forbidden.

""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> double O? It's allowed, but we might get less information.

""PROUD"" seems good.

But we also have the option of putting P at the end.

Another idea: since we know P is in the word and not at position 4, we can try to put it at position 1 or 5 to see if it fits there.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Let me list some words:

- ""PROUD"": P, R, O, U, D
- ""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L
- ""PRONG"": P, R, O, N, G -> but N is forbidden! So invalid.
- ""PRANK"": P, R, A, N, K -> A and N forbidden.
- ""FRUMP"": F, R, U, M, P -> P at the end.

Also, ""GROUP"": G, R, O, U, P -> but P is at the end? G R O U P -> position 1: G, 2: R, 3: O, 4: U, 5: P. So P is at 5. And it avoids forbidden letters? G, R, O, U, P: all allowed. And ""GROUP"" is a valid word.

So ""GROUP"" is a candidate.

Now, comparing ""PROUD"" and ""GROUP"":
- Both have O and U, but in different positions.
- ""PROUD"" has P at position 1, D at 5.
- ""GROUP"" has G at position 1, P at 5.

We don't know which is better. But note that in ""GROUP"", we are putting P at position 5, which is a new position to test. Similarly, in ""PROUD"", we test P at position 1.

We also haven't tested G, D, F, etc.

But let's think about the feedback we got for P: in ""trips"", P was at position 4 and got a dash, meaning it's in the word but not at 4. So it could be at 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 2 is R, so it can't be there. So P must be at 1, 3, or 5.

By putting P at 1 in ""PROUD"" or at 5 in ""GROUP"", we are testing one of these positions.

We can also consider words that put P at position 3? But we had trouble finding one.

Another candidate: ""CRUMP"" is invalid because of C. ""DRUMP"" not a word. ""TRUMP"" has T, which is forbidden. ""WRAPS"" has A and S.

How about ""HARPY""? But H, A, R, P, Y -> A is forbidden.

It's difficult. So let's stick with either ""PROUD"" or ""GROUP"".

I think ""GROUP"" is a good choice because it tests G and also puts P at the end, which is a new position.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat the vowels? But we don't have many vowel options.

Another candidate: ""PROXY"" -> P, R, O, X, Y -> but X and Y are less common, but it's valid. And it tests X and Y.

But we might prefer more common letters.

I think ""GROUP"" is better because G is a common consonant.

So I'll go with ""GROUP"".

But let's confirm the letters: G, R, O, U, P. 
- G: not forbidden? Yes.
- R: in position 2, correct.
- O: not forbidden? Yes.
- U: not forbidden? Yes.
- P: in the word, and we are testing position 5.

So, we guess ""GROUP"".

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries.

Alternatively, we could try to cover more letters? But ""GROUP"" covers G, O, U, and P (which we know).

Another idea: what about ""BROMP""? Not a word. ""DROOP"" -> D, R, O, O, P -> double O? And P at the end. But we can use it? ""DROOP"" is a word. But it has double O, which might be less informative.

I think ""GROUP"" is fine.

So, <guess>group</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback:

- **R** is confirmed in position 2 (✓ in both guesses).
- **P** is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""trips"" feedback: P(-)).
- **C, A, N, E, T, I, S** are absent (all marked ""x"").
- The secret word must have **R** in position 2, include **P** (not in position 4), and avoid forbidden letters.

For this guess (third attempt):
- I prioritized testing **P** in a new position (position 5) to locate it.
- I chose **""group""** because:
  - It places **R** correctly in position 2.
  - It moves **P** to position 5 (testing if it belongs there).
  - It introduces new common letters: **G** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **U** (position 4).
  - All letters (G, R, O, U, P) are allowed (none are forbidden).
- This maximizes information by testing three new letters while leveraging known constraints.

<guess>group</guess>",group,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""trips""
- T: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, same as before)
- I: x (not in word)
- P: - (in word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in word)

So, what we know so far:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter P is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since in ""trips"" it was in the fourth and got a dash).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.
- Therefore, the word contains R (at position 2) and P (somewhere not at position 4), and does not contain C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Includes the letter P (but not in the fourth position).
- Avoids the letters: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

Available letters: We can use any letter except the forbidden ones. The forbidden letters are: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

So, the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: P is already known to be in the word, so we should include it.

We also know that P is not in position 4. So in our new guess, we can put P in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but not 4, and position 2 is R).

We want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Common letters among the available ones: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, Y.

We already know P is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? But we need to find its position. So we should try to put P in a different position to test.

Possible positions for P: 1, 3, or 5.

We can also try to cover other vowels. The only vowel left that we haven't tested and is available is O, U, and sometimes Y. We know A, E, I are out.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ R _ _ _

And include P (not in position 4) and avoid forbidden letters.

Some ideas:

- If we put P in position 1: P R _ _ _
  - Then we need to fill the last three positions with available letters (not C,A,N,E,T,I,S) and including other new letters.
  - Example: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> but we have to check: O and U are vowels, D is consonant. But note: we don't know if O or U are in the word? So it's good to test.
  - However, in ""PROUD"", P is at position 1, which is new. And we have O, U, D to test.

- If we put P in position 3: _ R P _ _
  - Example: ""ORPHAN"" -> but H is allowed? Yes, but we have to check the letters: O, R, P, H, A -> A is forbidden! So invalid.
  - Another: ""CRUMP"" -> C is forbidden. Invalid.
  - ""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P -> but P is at position 5? Wait, let's see: position 1: G, 2: R, 3: U, 4: M, 5: P -> so P is at 5, not 3. So that doesn't put P at 3.

  Actually, for position 3: we need a word like _ R P _ _
  Example: ""WRAPS"" -> W, R, A, P, S -> but A and S are forbidden. Invalid.

  Another: ""DRUMP"" is not a word.

  How about ""CRIMP""? C is forbidden.

  It's hard to find a word with P in position 3 without using forbidden letters.

- If we put P in position 5: _ R _ _ P
  Example: ""BROMP"" not a word. ""GRAMP"" not a word. ""FRUMP"" -> F, R, U, M, P -> that's a word? Frump means to be sullen or sulky. It's acceptable? Let me check: yes, it's a valid word.

  But note: we are avoiding forbidden letters? F, R, U, M, P: none of these are forbidden. So ""FRUMP"" is a candidate.

  However, we are testing F, U, M, and P (which we know is in the word, but we are testing its position).

But let's go back to the first option: putting P in position 1.

Candidate: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> letters: P, O, U, D. We know P is in the word, so we are testing O, U, D.

But note: in ""PROUD"", P is at position 1. We don't know if P can be at position 1? It might be, because we only know it's not at position 4.

Another candidate: ""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W, L -> tests O, W, L.

But we have to avoid S, which we are.

Another: ""PROBE"" -> but E is forbidden.

""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> double O? It's allowed, but we might get less information.

""PROUD"" seems good.

But we also have the option of putting P at the end.

Another idea: since we know P is in the word and not at position 4, we can try to put it at position 1 or 5 to see if it fits there.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Let me list some words:

- ""PROUD"": P, R, O, U, D
- ""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L
- ""PRONG"": P, R, O, N, G -> but N is forbidden! So invalid.
- ""PRANK"": P, R, A, N, K -> A and N forbidden.
- ""FRUMP"": F, R, U, M, P -> P at the end.

Also, ""GROUP"": G, R, O, U, P -> but P is at the end? G R O U P -> position 1: G, 2: R, 3: O, 4: U, 5: P. So P is at 5. And it avoids forbidden letters? G, R, O, U, P: all allowed. And ""GROUP"" is a valid word.

So ""GROUP"" is a candidate.

Now, comparing ""PROUD"" and ""GROUP"":
- Both have O and U, but in different positions.
- ""PROUD"" has P at position 1, D at 5.
- ""GROUP"" has G at position 1, P at 5.

We don't know which is better. But note that in ""GROUP"", we are putting P at position 5, which is a new position to test. Similarly, in ""PROUD"", we test P at position 1.

We also haven't tested G, D, F, etc.

By putting P at 1 in ""PROUD"" or at 5 in ""GROUP"", we are testing one of these positions.

We can also consider words that put P at position 3? But we had trouble finding one.

Another candidate: ""CRUMP"" is invalid because of C. ""DRUMP"" not a word. ""TRUMP"" has T, which is forbidden. ""WRAPS"" has A and S.

How about ""HARPY""? But H, A, R, P, Y -> A is forbidden.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess:
 ""crane"" -> C: x, R: ✓, A: x, N: x, E: x

 Interpretation:
 - The letter 'R' is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
 - Letters 'C', 'A', 'N', 'E' are not in the secret word at all.

 So, we know:
 - The second letter of the secret word is 'R'.
 - The secret word does not contain the letters: C, A, N, E.

 We have 6 tries, and this is the second try.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Has 'R' in the second position.
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Additionally, we want to try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants besides R (which we already have) include: L, T, S, B, D, etc.
 Common vowels: We know A and E are out, so we can use I, O, U.

 Let's think of words that fit:
   _ R _ _ _

 Since we don't know other letters, we can try to cover more common letters.

 Example words: 
   We could consider ""PRICK"", but we don't know if P is safe? However, from the previous feedback we know that C is not in the word, so we can't use C.

 Actually, we know the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E. So any letter except these.

 Let's list some possibilities:
   Words with R in the second position: brick, bring, brisk, broad, broke, brown, brush, draft, drink, drive, drown, fruit, ... 

 But note: 
   - We cannot use any of the forbidden letters: A, C, N, E.

 Filter:
   brick: B, R, I, C, K -> contains C -> not allowed. Wait, but we know C is not in the word? Actually, we can use a word that has C? 
   But note: the rule says we must guess a valid 5-letter English word. However, using a letter that we know is not in the word (like C) would waste an opportunity to test other letters.

 It's strategically better to use a word that only uses letters that could potentially be in the word. So we avoid C, A, N, E.

 Therefore, ""brick"" is invalid because it has C? Actually, no, we can still use it as a guess? But it would be inefficient because we know C isn't in the word.

 Let me check: the feedback says C is not in the word. So if I guess a word with C, the feedback will show C with an 'x' again, which we already know. It's not giving new information.

 So, I should avoid using C, A, N, E.

 Now, back to words with R in the second position and without C, A, N, E.

 Possible words:
   - Using I: ""BRISK"", ""BRING"" -> but BRING has G? And we don't know about G? Also, BRING has N? N is forbidden -> wait, BRING: letters B,R,I,N,G -> N is forbidden so we cannot use N? Actually, we can use the word even if it contains forbidden letters? Yes, but it's not advised because:

   The game allows any valid English word. However, guessing a word that contains a letter we know is not present will not help us because that letter will get an 'x', and we already know it's not in the word.

   So to maximize information, we should choose a word that uses only letters that are not ruled out and are common.

   Therefore, let's look for words that:
        Position 2: R
        Letters: only from the remaining alphabet (not C, A, N, E)

   Examples:
        Try a word with O: ""BROOD"" -> but has double O? Let's find better ones.

        Better: ""BROAD""? But BROAD has A -> forbidden.

        ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> all allowed? Letters: B, O, I, L are not forbidden? Yes, because forbidden are C, A, N, E. So BROIL is a candidate.

        ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> forbidden? F, R, U, I, T: no forbidden letters.

        ""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> okay.

        ""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> double letter? Also allowed.

    But note: we don't want to repeat the mistake of using a word with double letters unless necessary? Not necessarily bad.

    However, we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

    Let me list common letters we haven't tested: 
        Not used yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

    We have 5 positions: first, third, fourth, fifth.

    We know the second is R.

    We can try to include several of these common letters.

    Common letters to test: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

    Consider ""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M -> but P is not forbidden? And we know R is already in place? However, note that in ""PRISM"", R is in the second position? Yes.

    But wait: we know the second letter is R, so any word we choose must have R as the second letter.

    So let's build:

        First letter: can be any letter except C, A, N, E -> let's choose a common consonant: S, T, B, P, etc.
        Third letter: vowel, e.g., I, O, U? Or consonant? We don't know much.

    Another idea: use a word that has many common letters and R in the second position.

    Some top candidates:

        ""STRIP"": S, T, R, I, P -> but positions: 
            Position1: S, Position2: R? Wait, no: STRIP is S-T-R-I-P -> so R is the third letter? Doesn't work.

    We need R as the second letter.

    So: words like `_ R _ _ _`.

    ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, O, U are new. But double T? It might be inefficient.

    ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> okay.

    ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H -> okay.

    ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> okay.

    ""DRIFT"": D, R, I, F, T -> okay.

    All these avoid C, A, N, E.

    Now, which one gives the most information? 

    We want to maximize the number of common letters we test.

    Let me choose ""BRUSH"": letters B, R, U, S, H.

    Why ""BRUSH""? 
        - B: common consonant
        - U: vowel (since we lost A and E, U might be useful)
        - S: very common
        - H: fairly common

    Alternatively, ""TRIPS"": but T, R, I, P, S -> R is the second? T R I P S -> that works? T (1st), R (2nd), I (3rd), P (4th), S (5th). Yes.

    But note: we know the second letter is R, so we can use any word that has R in the second position.

    ""TRIPS"" is T-R-I-P-S -> that fits.

    However, ""TRIPS"" avoids forbidden letters? T, R, I, P, S -> yes.

    Similarly, ""CRISP"": but C is forbidden -> invalid.

    So, ""TRIPS"" is a candidate.

    Now, comparing ""TRIPS"" vs ""BRUSH"":
        ""TRIPS"": letters: T, R, I, P, S -> all new except R, which we are reusing but that's okay because we know it's correct and we can confirm position? Actually, we already know R is in the correct position, so we expect a ✓ on R again.

        Which one tests more common letters? 
            TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> common letters: T, I, P, S are all common.
            BRUSH: B, R, U, S, H -> B, U, S, H: S is common, B is common, U and H are less common.

        So ""TRIPS"" might be better.

    Also, consider vowel: we haven't tested I or U. I is more common than U.

    Another candidate: ""ORBIT""? But O is in the first position? O-R-B-I-T -> okay, but note O is not forbidden? And we can use it.

    However, I think ""TRIPS"" is solid.

    But wait: the word must have R in the second position. ""ORBIT"": O-R-B-I-T -> so R is second? Yes.

    However, ""TRIPS"" uses the letter T at the beginning and S at the end.

    I decide to go with ""TRIPS"".

    Why not ""DRIVE""? But E is forbidden? Yes, but DRIVE has E -> so invalid.

    So, ""TRIPS"" is valid.

    Let me confirm: 
        T: not C,A,N,E -> okay.
        R: okay (and we know it's in the word and in position 2).
        I: okay.
        P: okay.
        S: okay.

    So ""TRIPS"" is a valid English word without forbidden letters.

    We'll guess ""TRIPS"".

    However, note: if the secret word has any of T, I, P, S, we'll get feedback.

    We hope to get more information.

    Alternatively, we could use a word with O? Like ""PROUD"" (P,R,O,U,D). But U and D are less common? Or ""GROUT""?

    But let's stick with ""TRIPS"".

<guess>trips</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **R** is correct and in the right position (2nd letter).
- **C, A, N, E** are not in the secret word.

For this guess (second attempt):
- I must include **R** in the **second position**.
- I must avoid using **C, A, N, E** to maximize information.
- I prioritized testing new common letters (**T, I, P, S**) while keeping R fixed in position 2.

I chose **""trips""** because:
- It covers frequent consonants (T, P, S) and a vowel (I), all untested.
- It avoids forbidden letters.
- As an English word, it meets game rules.

Next, I'll analyze feedback from this guess to inform my third attempt.

- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""trips""
- T: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, same as before)
- I: x (not in word)
- P: - (in word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in word)

So, what we know so far:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter P is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since in ""trips"" it was in the fourth and got a dash).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.
- Therefore, the word contains R (at position 2) and P (somewhere not at position 4), and does not contain C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Includes the letter P (but not in the fourth position).
- Avoids the letters: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

Available letters: We can use any letter except the forbidden ones. The forbidden letters are: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

So, the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: P is already known to be in the word, so we should include it.

We also know that P is not in position 4. So in our new guess, we can put P in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but not 4, and position 2 is R).

We want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Common letters among the available ones: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, Y.

We already know P is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? But we need to find its position. So we should try to put P in a different position to test.

Possible positions for P: 1, 3, or 5.

We can also try to cover other vowels. The only vowel left that we haven't tested and is available is O, U, and sometimes Y. We know A, E, I are out.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ R _ _ _

And include P (not in position 4) and avoid forbidden letters.

Some ideas:

- If we put P in position 1: P R _ _ _
  - Then we need to fill the last three positions with available letters (not C,A,N,E,T,I,S) and including other new letters.
  - Example: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> but we have to check: O and U are vowels, D is consonant. But note: we don't know if O or U are in the word? So it's good to test.
  - However, in ""PROUD"", P is at position 1, which is new. And we have O, U, D to test.

- If we put P in position 3: _ R P _ _
  - Example: ""ORPHAN"" -> but H is allowed? Yes, but we have to check the letters: O, R, P, H, A -> A is forbidden! So invalid.
  - Another: ""CRUMP"" -> C is forbidden. Invalid.
  - ""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P -> but P is at position 5? Wait, let's see: position 1: G, 2: R, 3: U, 4: M, 5: P -> so P is at 5, not 3. So that doesn't put P at 3.

  Actually, for position 3: we need a word like _ R P _ _
  Example: ""WRAPS"" -> W, R, A, P, S -> but A and S are forbidden. Invalid.

  Another: ""DRUMP"" is not a word.

  How about ""CRIMP""? C is forbidden.

  It's hard to find a word with P in position 3 without using forbidden letters.

- If we put P in position 5: _ R _ _ P
  Example: ""BROMP"" not a word. ""GRAMP"" not a word. ""FRUMP"" -> F, R, U, M, P -> that's a word? Frump means to be sullen or sulky. It's acceptable? Let me check: yes, it's a valid word.

  But note: we are avoiding forbidden letters? F, R, U, M, P: none of these are forbidden. So ""FRUMP"" is a candidate.

  However, we are testing F, U, M, and P (which we know is in the word, but we are testing its position).

But let's go back to the first option: putting P in position 1.

Candidate: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> letters: P, O, U, D. We know P is in the word, so we are testing O, U, D.

But note: in ""PROUD"", P is at position 1. We don't know if P can be at position 1? It might be, because we only know it's not at position 4.

Another candidate: ""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W, L -> tests O, W, L.

But we have to avoid S, which we are.

Another: ""PROBE"" -> but E is forbidden.

""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> double O? It's allowed, but we might get less information.

""PROUD"" seems good.

But we also have the option of putting P at the end.

Another idea: since we know P is in the word and not at position 4, we can try to put it at position 1 or 5 to see if it fits there.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Let me list some words:

- ""PROUD"": P, R, O, U, D
- ""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L
- ""PRONG"": P, R, O, N, G -> but N is forbidden! So invalid.
- ""PRANK"": P, R, A, N, K -> A and N forbidden.
- ""FRUMP"": F, R, U, M, P -> P at the end.

Also, ""GROUP"": G, R, O, U, P -> but P is at the end? G R O U P -> position 1: G, 2: R, 3: O, 4: U, 5: P. So P is at 5. And it avoids forbidden letters? G, R, O, U, P: all allowed. And ""GROUP"" is a valid word.

So ""GROUP"" is a candidate.

Now, comparing ""PROUD"" and ""GROUP"":
- Both have O and U, but in different positions.
- ""PROUD"" has P at position 1, D at 5.
- ""GROUP"" has G at position 1, P at 5.

We don't know which is better. But note that in ""GROUP"", we are putting P at position 5, which is a new position to test. Similarly, in ""PROUD"", we test P at position 1.

We also haven't tested G, D, F, etc.

But let's think about the feedback we got for P: in ""trips"", P was at position 4 and got a dash, meaning it's in the word but not at 4. So it could be at 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 2 is R, so it can't be there. So P must be at 1, 3, or 5.

By putting P at 1 in ""PROUD"" or at 5 in ""GROUP"", we are testing one of these positions.

We can also consider words that put P at position 3? But we had trouble finding one.

Another candidate: ""CRUMP"" is invalid because of C. ""DRUMP"" not a word. ""TRUMP"" has T, which is forbidden. ""WRAPS"" has A and S.

How about ""HARPY""? But H, A, R, P, Y -> A is forbidden.

It's difficult. So let's stick with either ""PROUD"" or ""GROUP"".

I think ""GROUP"" is a good choice because it tests G and also puts P at the end, which is a new position.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat the vowels? But we don't have many vowel options.

Another candidate: ""PROXY"" -> P, R, O, X, Y -> but X and Y are less common, but it's valid. And it tests X and Y.

But we might prefer more common letters.

I think ""GROUP"" is better because G is a common consonant.

So I'll go with ""GROUP"".

But let's confirm the letters: G, R, O, U, P. 
- G: not forbidden? Yes.
- R: in position 2, correct.
- O: not forbidden? Yes.
- U: not forbidden? Yes.
- P: in the word, and we are testing position 5.

So, we guess ""GROUP"".

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries.

Alternatively, we could try to cover more letters? But ""GROUP"" covers G, O, U, and P (which we know).

Another idea: what about ""BROMP""? Not a word. ""DROOP"" -> D, R, O, O, P -> double O? And P at the end. But we can use it? ""DROOP"" is a word. But it has double O, which might be less informative.

I think ""GROUP"" is fine.

So, <guess>group</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

- **R** is confirmed in position 2 (✓ in both guesses).
- **P** is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""trips"" feedback: P(-)).
- **C, A, N, E, T, I, S** are absent (all marked ""x"").
- The secret word must have **R** in position 2, include **P** (not in position 4), and avoid forbidden letters.

For this guess (third attempt):
- I prioritized testing **P** in a new position (position 5) to locate it.
- I chose **""group""** because:
  - It places **R** correctly in position 2.
  - It moves **P** to position 5 (testing if it belongs there).
  - It introduces new common letters: **G** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **U** (position 4).
  - All letters (G, R, O, U, P) are allowed (none are forbidden).
- This maximizes information by testing three new letters while leveraging known constraints.

However, from the previous feedback we know that C is not in the word, so we can\'t use C.\n\n Actually, we know the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E. So any letter except these.\n\n Let\'s list some possibilities:\n   Words with R in the second position: brick, bring, brisk, broad, broke, brown, brush, draft, drink, drive, drown, fruit, ... \n\n But note: \n   - We cannot use any of the forbidden letters: A, C, N, E.\n\n Filter:\n   brick: B, R, I, C, K -> contains C -> not allowed. Wait, but we know C is not in the word? Actually, we can use a word that has C? \n   But note: the rule says we must guess a valid 5-letter English word. However, using a letter that we know is not in the word (like C) would waste an opportunity to test other letters.\n\n It\'s strategically better to use a word that only uses letters that could potentially be in the word. So we avoid C, A, N, E.\n\n Therefore, ""brick"" is invalid because it has C? Actually, no, we can still use it as a guess? But it would be inefficient because we know C isn\'t in the word.\n\n Let me check: the feedback says C is not in the word. So if I guess a word with C, the feedback will show C with an \'x\' again, which we already know. It\'s not giving new information.\n\n So, I should avoid using C, A, N, E.\n\n Now, back to words with R in the second position and without C, A, N, E.\n\n Possible words:\n   - Using I: ""BRISK"", ""BRING"" -> but BRING has G? And we don\'t know about G? Also, BRING has N? N is forbidden -> wait, BRING: letters B,R,I,N,G -> N is forbidden so we cannot use N? Actually, we can use the word even if it contains forbidden letters? Yes, but it\'s not advised because:\n\n   The game allows any valid English word. However, guessing a word that contains a letter we know is not present will not help us because that letter will get an \'x\', and we already know it\'s not in the word.\n\n   So to maximize information, we should choose a word that uses only letters that are not ruled out and are common.\n\n   Therefore, let\'s look for words that:\n        Position 2: R\n        Letters: only from the remaining alphabet (not C, A, N, E)\n\n   Examples:\n        Try a word with O: ""BROOD"" -> but has double O? Let\'s find better ones.\n\n        Better: ""BROAD""? But BROAD has A -> forbidden.\n\n        ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> all allowed? Letters: B, O, I, L are not forbidden? Yes, because forbidden are C, A, N, E. So BROIL is a candidate.\n\n        ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> forbidden? F, R, U, I, T: no forbidden letters.\n\n        ""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> okay.\n\n        ""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> double letter? Also allowed.\n\n    But note: we don\'t want to repeat the mistake of using a word with double letters unless necessary? Not necessarily bad.\n\n    However, we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\n    Let me list common letters we haven\'t tested: \n        Not used yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n    We have 5 positions: first, third, fourth, fifth.\n\n    We know the second is R.\n\n    We can try to include several of these common letters.\n\n    Common letters to test: S, T, L, I, O, etc.\n\n    Consider ""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M -> but P is not forbidden? And we know R is already in place? However, note that in ""PRISM"", R is in the second position? Yes.\n\n    But wait: we know the second letter is R, so any word we choose must have R as the second letter.\n\n    So let\'s build:\n\n        First letter: can be any letter except C, A, N, E -> let\'s choose a common consonant: S, T, B, P, etc.\n        Third letter: vowel, e.g., I, O, U? Or consonant? We don\'t know much.\n\n    Another idea: use a word that has many common letters and R in the second position.\n\n    Some top candidates:\n\n        ""STRIP"": S, T, R, I, P -> but positions: \n            Position1: S, Position2: R? Wait, no: STRIP is S-T-R-I-P -> so R is the third letter? Doesn\'t work.\n\n    We need R as the second letter.\n\n    So: words like `_ R _ _ _`.\n\n    ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, O, U are new. But double T? It might be inefficient.\n\n    ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> okay.\n\n    ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H -> okay.\n\n    ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> okay.\n\n    ""DRIFT"": D, R, I, F, T -> okay.\n\n    All these avoid C, A, N, E.\n\n    Now, which one gives the most information? \n\n    We want to maximize the number of common letters we test.\n\n    Let me choose ""BRUSH"": letters B, R, U, S, H.\n\n    Why ""BRUSH""? \n        - B: common consonant\n        - U: vowel (since we lost A and E, U might be useful)\n        - S: very common\n        - H: fairly common\n\n    Alternatively, ""TRIPS"": but T, R, I, P, S -> R is the second? T R I P S -> that works? T (1st), R (2nd), I (3rd), P (4th), S (5th). Yes.\n\n    But note: we know the second letter is R, so we can use any word that has R in the second position.\n\n    ""TRIPS"" is T-R-I-P-S -> that fits.\n\n    However, ""TRIPS"" avoids forbidden letters? T, R, I, P, S -> yes.\n\n    Similarly, ""CRISP"": but C is forbidden -> invalid.\n\n    So, ""TRIPS"" is a candidate.\n\n    Now, comparing ""TRIPS"" vs ""BRUSH"":\n        ""TRIPS"": letters: T, R, I, P, S -> all new except R, which we are reusing but that\'s okay because we know it\'s correct and we can confirm position? Actually, we already know R is in the correct position, so we expect a ✓ on R again.\n\n        Which one tests more common letters? \n            TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> common letters: T, I, P, S are all common.\n            BRUSH: B, R, U, S, H -> B, U, S, H: S is common, B is common, U and H are less common.\n\n        So ""TRIPS"" might be better.\n\n    Also, consider vowel: we haven\'t tested I or U. I is more common than U.\n\n    Another candidate: ""ORBIT""? But O is in the first position? O-R-B-I-T -> okay, but note O is not forbidden? And we can use it.\n\n    However, I think ""TRIPS"" is solid.\n\n    But wait: the word must have R in the second position. ""ORBIT"": O-R-B-I-T -> so R is second? Yes.\n\n    However, ""TRIPS"" uses the letter T at the beginning and S at the end.\n\n    I decide to go with ""TRIPS"".\n\n    Why not ""DRIVE""? But E is forbidden? Yes, but DRIVE has E -> so invalid.\n\n    So, ""TRIPS"" is valid.\n\n    Let me confirm: \n        T: not C,A,N,E -> okay.\n        R: okay (and we know it\'s in the word and in position 2).\n        I: okay.\n        P: okay.\n        S: okay.\n\n    So ""TRIPS"" is a valid English word without forbidden letters.\n\n    We\'ll guess ""TRIPS"".\n\n    However, note: if the secret word has any of T, I, P, S, we\'ll get feedback.\n\n    We hope to get more information.\n\n    Alternatively, we could use a word with O? Like ""PROUD"" (P,R,O,U,D). But U and D are less common? Or ""GROUT""?\n\n    But let\'s stick with ""TRIPS"".\n\n<guess>trips</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **R** is correct and in the right position (2nd letter).\n- **C, A, N, E** are not in the secret word.\n\nFor this guess (second attempt):\n- I must include **R** in the **second position**.\n- I must avoid using **C, A, N, E** to maximize information.\n- I prioritized testing new common letters (**T, I, P, S**) while keeping R fixed in position 2.\n\nI chose **""trips""** because:\n- It covers frequent consonants (T, P, S) and a vowel (I), all untested.\n- It avoids forbidden letters.\n- As an English word, it meets game rules.\n\nNext, I\'ll analyze feedback from this guess to inform my third attempt.\n\n<guess>trips</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) P(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""trips""\n- T: x (not in word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, same as before)\n- I: x (not in word)\n- P: - (in word but wrong position)\n- S: x (not in word)\n\nSo, what we know so far:\n- The second letter is R.\n- The letter P is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since in ""trips"" it was in the fourth and got a dash).\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.\n- Therefore, the word contains R (at position 2) and P (somewhere not at position 4), and does not contain C, A, N, E, T, I, S.\n\nWe need to form a new 5-letter word that:\n- Has R in the second position.\n- Includes the letter P (but not in the fourth position).\n- Avoids the letters: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use any letter except the forbidden ones.

So invalid.\n- ""PRANK"": P, R, A, N, K -> A and N forbidden.\n- ""FRUMP"": F, R, U, M, P -> P at the end.\n\nAlso, ""GROUP"": G, R, O, U, P -> but P is at the end? G R O U P -> position 1: G, 2: R, 3: O, 4: U, 5: P. So P is at 5. And it avoids forbidden letters? G, R, O, U, P: all allowed. And ""GROUP"" is a valid word.\n\nSo ""GROUP"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, comparing ""PROUD"" and ""GROUP"":\n- Both have O and U, but in different positions.\n- ""PROUD"" has P at position 1, D at 5.\n- ""GROUP"" has G at position 1, P at 5.\n\nWe don\'t know which is better. But note that in ""GROUP"", we are putting P at position 5, which is a new position to test. Similarly, in ""PROUD"", we test P at position 1.\n\nWe also haven\'t tested G, D, F, etc.\n\nBut let\'s think about the feedback we got for P: in ""trips"", P was at position 4 and got a dash, meaning it\'s in the word but not at 4. So it could be at 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 2 is R, so it can\'t be there. So P must be at 1, 3, or 5.\n\nBy putting P at 1 in ""PROUD"" or at 5 in ""GROUP"", we are testing one of these positions.\n\nWe can also consider words that put P at position 3? But we had trouble finding one.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CRUMP"" is invalid because of C. ""DRUMP"" not a word. ""TRUMP"" has T, which is forbidden. ""WRAPS"" has A and S.\n\nHow about ""HARPY""? But H, A, R, P, Y -> A is forbidden.\n\nIt\'s difficult. So let\'s stick with either ""PROUD"" or ""GROUP"".\n\nI think ""GROUP"" is a good choice because it tests G and also puts P at the end, which is a new position.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t repeat the vowels? But we don\'t have many vowel options.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PROXY"" -> P, R, O, X, Y -> but X and Y are less common, but it\'s valid. And it tests X and Y.\n\nBut we might prefer more common letters.\n\nI think ""GROUP"" is better because G is a common consonant.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""GROUP"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: G, R, O, U, P. \n- G: not forbidden? Yes.\n- R: in position 2, correct.\n- O: not forbidden? Yes.\n- U: not forbidden? Yes.\n- P: in the word, and we are testing position 5.\n\nSo, we guess ""GROUP"".\n\nBut note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to cover more letters? But ""GROUP"" covers G, O, U, and P (which we know).\n\nAnother idea: what about ""BROMP""? Not a word. ""DROOP"" -> D, R, O, O, P -> double O? And P at the end. But we can use it? ""DROOP"" is a word. But it has double O, which might be less informative.\n\nI think ""GROUP"" is fine.\n\nSo, <guess>group</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n\n- **R** is confirmed in position 2 (✓ in both guesses).\n- **P** is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""trips"" feedback: P(-)).\n- **C, A, N, E, T, I, S** are absent (all marked ""x"").\n- The secret word must have **R** in position 2, include **P** (not in position 4), and avoid forbidden letters.\n\nFor this guess (third attempt):\n- I prioritized testing **P** in a new position (position 5) to locate it.\n- I chose **""group""** because:\n  - It places **R** correctly in position 2.\n  - It moves **P** to position 5 (testing if it belongs there).\n  - It introduces new common letters: **G** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **U** (position 4).\n  - All letters (G, R, O, U, P) are allowed (none are forbidden).\n- This maximizes information by testing three new letters while leveraging known constraints.\n\n<guess>group</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) P(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: group -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) P(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""trips"" -> T(x), R(✓), I(x), P(-), S(x)
  - R is still correct in position 2.
  - P is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it was guessed in position 4 and got a dash).
  - T, I, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""group"" -> G(x), R(✓), O(✓), U(x), P(-)
  - R and O are correct: R in position 2, O in position 3 (since in ""group"", O is the 3rd letter and got a check).
  - P is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was guessed in position 5 and got a dash).
  - G and U are not in the word.

So, what we know now:

1. The word has the following pattern: _ R O _ _ 
   - Because from ""group"", we have R(✓) at position 2 and O(✓) at position 3.

2. The letter P is in the word, but it is not in position 4 (from ""trips"") and not in position 5 (from ""group""). 
   - Therefore, P must be in position 1 (since position 2 is R and position 3 is O, so only positions 1, 4, and 5 are left, but we've ruled out 4 and 5). 
   - However, we have only 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is R and position 3 is O, so P cannot be there. We have tested P in positions 4 and 5 and got dashes, meaning it is in the word but not in those positions. Therefore, the only position left for P is position 1.

3. Therefore, the word must start with P? But wait, we haven't tested P in position 1 yet. We have only tested it in positions 4 and 5. So it must be in position 1? 

   Let me confirm: 
   - The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
   - We know: 
        Position 2: R
        Position 3: O
   - P is in the word, but not in position 4 (from ""trips"") and not in position 5 (from ""group""). 
   - Therefore, the only positions left are 1 and ... but we have position 1 and that's it? Because 2 and 3 are taken by R and O, and 4 and 5 are ruled out for P. So P must be in position 1.

   However, we must consider that P might be in position 1, but we haven't tested it there. So we can test it.

   But note: we also have to fill position 4 and 5.

4. Additionally, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U.

   Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U.

   So available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   But note: P is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? But we are going to put it in position 1.

5. Therefore, the word must be: P R O _ _

   And we need to fill the last two positions with letters from the available set, and they must form a valid English word.

   Also, note that we have not tested many letters, so we should try to use common letters for positions 4 and 5.

6. Now, what are possible words? 

   Pattern: ""PRO__""

   We need two letters for the last two positions, from the available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: P is already used at the start, but it can be repeated? In Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, we haven't seen any indication of repetition so far, and in the feedback, we haven't had any duplicate letters in guesses, so we don't know. But we should consider the possibility.)

   However, in our case, we know P is in the word, and we are putting it at position 1. But if the word has two P's, then we might have P elsewhere? But we have already tested positions 4 and 5 for P and got dashes, meaning that if there is only one P, then it must be at 1. But if there are two P's, then one is at 1 and the other could be at 4 or 5? But the feedback for ""group"" and ""trips"" only showed one P? 

   Let me check the feedback:

   - In ""trips"", we had P in position 4 and got a dash, meaning that there is at least one P in the word, but not at 4. It doesn't say anything about other positions. Similarly, in ""group"", P in position 5 got a dash, meaning not at 5. But if the word had two P's, then we might have one at 1 and one at 4 or 5? But we got dashes for 4 and 5, so if there is a P at 4 or 5, it would have been marked as present (dash) only if it is in the word but wrong position? But we got dashes, meaning that there is a P, but not at that position. So if there is a P at 4, then when we guessed ""trips"" with P at 4, it would have been a check? But it was a dash, so there is no P at 4. Similarly, no P at 5. Therefore, the only position left for P is 1. And if there is only one P, then that's it.

   So we assume the word is ""PRO__"" with two more letters.

7. Now, list possible words:

   We need to find words that start with ""PRO"" and then two letters from the available set (B, D, F, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and avoid the forbidden letters.

   Common words:

   - PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> W and L are available? Yes. But we haven't tested W or L. So it's a candidate.

   - PROBE: but E is forbidden.

   - PROOF: O is repeated? But we don't know if O is repeated. However, we have O in position 3, so if we put O again, it would be a repeat. But the feedback for ""group"" had only one O and it was marked correct? It doesn't tell us if there is another O. But we can use it? However, ""PROOF"" has O at position 3 and 4? Pattern: P R O O F -> but we have position 3 as O, and then position 4 as O. But we don't know if the word has two O's. Also, F is available.

   But note: in ""group"", we had O at position 3 and it was correct. If the word had another O, say at position 4, then when we guessed ""group"" (which has U at position 4, not O), we wouldn't have known about the second O. So it's possible.

   However, we are to avoid forbidden letters. F is not forbidden? Yes.

   But let's list:

   - PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> available letters: W and L are allowed.
   - PROD: but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So no.
   - PROFS: but S is forbidden.
   - PROLE: E is forbidden.
   - PROM: too short.
   - PRONG: N is forbidden.
   - PROUD: U is forbidden? Yes, from ""group"" feedback, U is not in the word.

   So ""PROUD"" is invalid.

   - PROWL and PROOF are candidates.

   Also, ""PROXY"": P, R, O, X, Y -> X and Y are available? Yes.

   And ""PROHM""? Not a word.

   ""PROEM"": E is forbidden.

   ""PROSO"": S and O? S is forbidden.

   ""PROLL"": not a common word? But let's check: ""proll"" is not standard. We should stick to common words.

   So the common ones are: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

   Now, we have to choose one. We want to maximize information? But we are in a good position because we have the first three letters. We just need to find the last two.

   However, we have only 3 guesses left (this is the fourth guess, and we have 6 total, so 3 more after this? Wait, we are on the fourth guess now? Let me count:

        Guess 1: crane
        Guess 2: trips
        Guess 3: group
        Now we are making guess 4.

   We have 3 guesses left? Actually, 6 total, so after this, 2 left.

   But we can try to guess the word.

   We have three candidates: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

   We also have to consider that we might not have thought of all words. But let's see.

   Another one: ""PROVE"": but E is forbidden.

   ""PROKE"": not common and E is forbidden.

   ""PROMY""? Not a word.

   ""PROZY""? Not a word.

   ""PROBF"": not a word.

   So the main ones are PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

   Now, which one to choose? We can pick one and see.

   But note: we haven't tested the letters W, L, F, X, Y.

   We can choose ""PROXY"" because it tests X and Y, which are less common, so if it's not the word, we get information about X and Y.

   Alternatively, ""PROWL"" tests W and L.

   ""PROOF"" tests F and also tests if there is a double O.

   However, we already know O is in the word at position 3, so if we use ""PROOF"", we are testing if there is an O at position 4? But we don't have any information about position 4 yet.

   But note: if the word is ""PROOF"", then we would get O at position 4 as correct? But we are guessing it.

   Since we have limited guesses, we might as well guess one of these.

   But let's think: the feedback from ""group"" told us that O is at position 3. It doesn't tell us about other O's. So if we guess ""PROOF"", and the word is ""PROWL"", then we would get:

        P: ✓ (because we put it at 1, and it should be correct if the word is PROWL? But wait, if the word is PROWL, then P is at 1? Yes, so it would be correct.

        R: ✓
        O: ✓ (at position 3)
        O: ? at position 4: if the word is PROWL, then position 4 is W, so the second O in ""PROOF"" would be an O at position 4, which is not in the word? So it would be an 'x'? But wait, the word PROWL has no O at position 4, so the second O in ""PROOF"" would be marked as not in the word? But we already have one O in the word? 

   Actually, the feedback for duplicate letters: if the word has one O, and we guess two O's, then one O (the one in the correct position) would be a check, and the other O would be an x if the word doesn't have a second O.

   So if we guess ""PROOF"" and the word is ""PROWL"", we would get:

        P: ✓
        R: ✓
        O: ✓ (position 3)
        O: x (because there is no second O in the word)
        F: x (if the word is PROWL, which has L at the end, not F)

   This would tell us that the last two letters are not O and F, but we would know that the first three are PRO, and then we have to figure out the last two.

   Alternatively, if we guess ""PROWL"" and the word is ""PROOF"", we would get:

        P: ✓
        R: ✓
        O: ✓
        W: x (not in word)
        L: x (not in word)

   Then we would know that the last two are not W and L, and we might try ""PROOF"" next.

   But we can also consider that we have only two more guesses after this, so we want to maximize the chance of getting it right or getting information.

   Another idea: we can choose a word that uses two new letters that are common, so that if it's not the word, we get information about more letters.

   For example, ""PROWL"" uses W and L, which are common. ""PROXY"" uses X and Y, which are less common. ""PROOF"" uses F and a double O.

   Since we are not sure, I think we should go with ""PROWL"" because W and L are more common than X and Y, and we might get more information.

   But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters, and we are.

   Alternatively, we can think of a word that uses two letters that we haven't tested and are common, but also might be in the word.

   But I think ""PROWL"" is a good choice.

   However, let me check if there are other words we haven't considered.

   What about ""PROHM""? Not a word.

   ""PROVE"": E forbidden.

   ""PRUDE"": U and E forbidden.

   ""PRIME"": I and E forbidden.

   So I think the main options are the three I mentioned.

   I'll go with ""PROWL"".

   But wait: we have to make sure that we are not missing something. The word could be ""PROUD"", but U is forbidden, so no.

   Another word: ""PROBE"" is out because of E.

   ""PRONE"": E and N forbidden.

   So, I think ""PROWL"" is a valid guess.

   Therefore, we guess ""PROWL"".

   But note: we are putting P at position 1. We haven't tested it there, but we deduced it must be there. If we are wrong, then we get feedback that P is not at position 1? But then we have a problem because we thought it must be. 

   Let me double-check the deduction:

   - We know P is in the word (from ""trips"" and ""group"").
   - We know it is not in position 4 (from ""trips"").
   - We know it is not in position 5 (from ""group"").
   - The only positions left are 1 and 3? But position 3 is O (from ""group"" feedback: O is correct at position 3). So P cannot be at position 3 because that would conflict with O? 

   Therefore, the only position left for P is position 1.

   So we are confident.

   We guess ""PROWL"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C(✗), R(✓), A(✗), N(✗), E(✗)  
   → **R** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 2**.  
   → C, A, N, E are **absent**.

2. **Guess 2: ""trips""**  
   - T(✗), R(✓), I(✗), P(➖), S(✗)  
   → **R** is still **correct at position 2**.  
   → **P** is present but **not at position 4**.  
   → T, I, S are **absent**.

3. **Guess 3: ""group""**  
   - G(✗), R(✓), O(✓), U(✗), P(➖)  
   → **R** is **correct at position 2**, **O** is **correct at position 3**.  
   → **P** is present but **not at position 5**.  
   → G, U are **absent**.

### Key Deductions:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R O _ _` (positions 2 and 3 are fixed as **R** and **O**).
- **P must be in position 1**:  
  - P is in the word (from Guess 2 and 3) but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (ruled out by feedback).  
  - Position 2 is R and position 3 is O, so P **must** be in position 1.  
  → Secret word starts with **P**: `P R O _ _`.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U (cannot be used).
- **Available letters for positions 4–5**: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, W, X, Y, Z (no duplicates, as feedback shows no repeats so far).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- We know the word starts with **PRO**, so we need to test **two new letters** for positions 4–5.
- Prioritize common consonants (e.g., L, W, F) to maximize information if the guess is incorrect.
- **Top word candidates** (fitting `PRO__` and avoiding forbidden letters):
  - **PROWL**: Tests **W** (position 4) and **L** (position 5).  
  - **PROXY**: Tests **X** (position 4) and **Y** (position 5).  
  - **PROOF**: Tests double **O** (position 4) and **F** (position 5).  
- **Why ""prowl""?**  
  - Uses common letters **W** and **L** (more frequent than X/Y in English).  
  - Avoids less common letters and double letters (unlike ""PROOF"").  
  - If incorrect, feedback on W/L will narrow options significantly.

<guess>prowl</guess>",prowl,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""trips"" -> T(x), R(✓), I(x), P(-), S(x)
  - R is still correct in position 2.
  - P is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it was guessed in position 4 and got a dash).
  - T, I, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""group"" -> G(x), R(✓), O(✓), U(x), P(-)
  - R and O are correct: R in position 2, O in position 3 (since in ""group"", O is the 3rd letter and got a check).
  - P is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was guessed in position 5 and got a dash).
  - G and U are not in the word.

So, what we know now:

1. The word has the following pattern: _ R O _ _ 
   - Because from ""group"", we have R(✓) at position 2 and O(✓) at position 3.

2. The letter P is in the word, but it is not in position 4 (from ""trips"") and not in position 5 (from ""group""). 
   - Therefore, P must be in position 1 (since position 2 is R and position 3 is O, so only positions 1, 4, and 5 are left, but we've ruled out 4 and 5). 
   - However, we have only 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is R and position 3 is O, so P cannot be there. We have tested P in positions 4 and 5 and got dashes, meaning it is in the word but not in those positions. Therefore, the only position left for P is position 1.

3. Therefore, the word must start with P? But wait, we haven't tested P in position 1 yet. We have only tested it in positions 4 and 5. So it must be in position 1? 

   Let me confirm: 
   - The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
   - We know: 
        Position 2: R
        Position 3: O
   - P is in the word, but not in position 4 (from ""trips"") and not in position 5 (from ""group""). 
   - Therefore, the only positions left are 1 and ... but we have position 1 and that's it? Because 2 and 3 are taken by R and O, and 4 and 5 are ruled out for P. So P must be in position 1.

   However, we must consider that P might be in position 1, but we haven't tested it there. So we can test it.

   But note: we also have to fill position 4 and 5.

4. Additionally, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U.

   Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U.

   So available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   But note: P is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? But we are going to put it in position 1.

5. Therefore, the word must be: P R O _ _

   And we need to fill the last two positions with letters from the available set, and they must form a valid English word.

   Also, note that we have not tested many letters, so we should try to use common letters for positions 4 and 5.

6. Now, what are possible words? 

   Pattern: ""PRO__""

   We need two letters for the last two positions, from the available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: P is already used at the start, but it can be repeated? In Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, we haven't seen any indication of repetition so far, and in the feedback, we haven't had any duplicate letters in guesses, so we don't know. But we should consider the possibility.)

   However, in our case, we know P is in the word, and we are putting it at position 1. But if the word has two P's, then we might have P elsewhere? But we have already tested positions 4 and 5 for P and got dashes, meaning that if there is only one P, then it must be at 1. But if there are two P's, then one is at 1 and the other could be at 4 or 5? But the feedback for ""group"" and ""trips"" only showed one P? 

   Let me check the feedback:

   - In ""trips"", we had P in position 4 and got a dash, meaning that there is at least one P in the word, but not at 4. It doesn't say anything about other positions. Similarly, in ""group"", P in position 5 got a dash, meaning not at 5. But if the word had two P's, then we might have one at 1 and one at 4 or 5? But we got dashes for 4 and 5, so if there is a P at 4 or 5, it would have been marked as present (dash) only if it is in the word but wrong position? But we got dashes, meaning that there is a P, but not at that position. So if there is a P at 4, then when we guessed ""trips"" with P at 4, it would have been a check? But it was a dash, so there is no P at 4. Similarly, no P at 5. Therefore, the only position left for P is 1. And if there is only one P, then that's it.

   So we assume the word is ""PRO__"" with two more letters.

7. Now, list possible words:

   We need to find words that start with ""PRO"" and then two letters from the available set (B, D, F, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and avoid the forbidden letters.

   Common words:

   - PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> W and L are available? Yes. But we haven't tested W or L. So it's a candidate.

   - PROBE: but E is forbidden.

   - PROOF: O is repeated? But we don't know if O is repeated. However, we have O in position 3, so if we put O again, it would be a repeat. But the feedback for ""group"" had only one O and it was marked correct? It doesn't tell us if there is another O. But we can use it? However, ""PROOF"" has O at position 3 and 4? Pattern: P R O O F -> but we have position 3 as O, and then position 4 as O. But we don't know if the word has two O's. Also, F is available.

   But note: in ""group"", we had O at position 3 and it was correct. If the word had another O, say at position 4, then when we guessed ""group"" (which has U at position 4, not O), we wouldn't have known about the second O. So it's possible.

   However, we are to avoid forbidden letters. F is not forbidden? Yes.

   But let's list:

   - PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> available letters: W and L are allowed.
   - PROD: but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So no.
   - PROFS: but S is forbidden.
   - PROLE: E is forbidden.
   - PROM: too short.
   - PRONG: N is forbidden.
   - PROUD: U is forbidden? Yes, from ""group"" feedback, U is not in the word.

   So ""PROUD"" is invalid.

   - PROWL and PROOF are candidates.

   Also, ""PROXY"": P, R, O, X, Y -> X and Y are available? Yes.

   And ""PROHM""? Not a word.

   ""PROEM"": E is forbidden.

   ""PROSO"": S and O? S is forbidden.

   ""PROLL"": not a common word? But let's check: ""proll"" is not standard. We should stick to common words.

   So the common ones are: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

   Now, we have to choose one. We want to maximize information? But we are in a good position because we have the first three letters. We just need to find the last two.

   However, we have only 3 guesses left (this is the fourth guess, and we have 6 total, so 3 more after this? Wait, we are on the fourth guess now? Let me count:

        Guess 1: crane
        Guess 2: trips
        Guess 3: group
        Now we are making guess 4.

   We have 3 guesses left? Actually, 6 total, so after this, 2 left.

   But we can try to guess the word.

   We have three candidates: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

   We also have to consider that we might not have thought of all words. But let's see.

   Another one: ""PROVE"": but E is forbidden.

   ""PROKE"": not common and E is forbidden.

   ""PROMY""? Not a word.

   ""PROZY""? Not a word.

   ""PROBF"": not a word.

   So the main ones are PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

   Now, which one to choose? We can pick one and see.

   But note: we haven't tested the letters W, L, F, X, Y.

   We can choose ""PROXY"" because it tests X and Y, which are less common, so if it's not the word, we get information about X and Y.

   Alternatively, ""PROWL"" tests W and L.

   ""PROOF"" tests F and also tests if there is a double O.

   However, we already know O is in the word at position 3, so if we use ""PROOF"", we are testing if there is an O at position 4? But we don't have any information about position 4 yet.

   But note: if the word is ""PROOF"", then we would get O at position 4 as correct? But we are guessing it.

   Since we have limited guesses, we might as well guess one of these.

   But let's think: the feedback from ""group"" told us that O is at position 3. It doesn't tell us about other O's. So if we guess ""PROOF"", and the word is ""PROWL"", then we would get:

        P: ✓ (because we put it at 1, and it should be correct if the word is PROWL? But wait, if the word is PROWL, then P is at 1? Yes, so it would be correct.

        R: ✓
        O: ✓ (at position 3)
        O: ? at position 4: if the word is PROWL, then position 4 is W, so the second O in ""PROOF"" would be an O at position 4, which is not in the word? So it would be an 'x'? But wait, the word PROWL has no O at position 4, so the second O in ""PROOF"" would be marked as not in the word? But we already have one O in the word? 

   Actually, the feedback for duplicate letters: if the word has one O, and we guess two O's, then one O (the one in the correct position) would be a check, and the other O would be an x if the word doesn't have a second O.

   So if we guess ""PROOF"" and the word is ""PROWL"", we would get:

        P: ✓
        R: ✓
        O: ✓ (position 3)
        O: x (because there is no second O in the word)
        F: x (if the word is PROWL, which has L at the end, not F)

   This would tell us that the last two letters are not O and F, but we would know that the first three are PRO, and then we have to figure out the last two.

   Alternatively, if we guess ""PROWL"" and the word is ""PROOF"", we would get:

        P: ✓
        R: ✓
        O: ✓
        W: x (not in word)
        L: x (not in word)

   Then we would know that the last two are not W and L, and we might try ""PROOF"" next.

   But we can also consider that we have only two more guesses after this, so we want to maximize the chance of getting it right or getting information.

   Another idea: we can choose a word that uses two new letters that are common, so that if it's not the word, we get information about more letters.

   For example, ""PROWL"" uses W and L, which are common. ""PROXY"" uses X and Y, which are less common. ""PROOF"" uses F and a double O.

   Since we are not sure, I think we should go with ""PROWL"" because W and L are more common than X and Y, and we might get more information.

   But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters, and we are.

   Alternatively, we can think of a word that uses two letters that we haven't tested and are common, but also might be in the word.

   But I think ""PROWL"" is a good choice.

   However, let me check if there are other words we haven't considered.

   What about ""PROHM""? Not a word.

   ""PROVE"": E forbidden.

   ""PRUDE"": U and E forbidden.

   ""PRIME"": I and E forbidden.

   So I think the main options are the three I mentioned.

   I'll go with ""PROWL"".

   But wait: we have to make sure that we are not missing something. The word could be ""PROUD"", but U is forbidden, so no.

   Another word: ""PROBE"" is out because of E.

   ""PRONE"": E and N forbidden.

   So, I think ""PROWL"" is a valid guess.

   Therefore, we guess ""PROWL"".

   But note: we are putting P at position 1. We haven't tested it there, but we deduced it must be there. If we are wrong, then we get feedback that P is not at position 1? But then we have a problem because we thought it must be. 

   Let me double-check the deduction:

   - We know P is in the word (from ""trips"" and ""group"").
   - We know it is not in position 4 (from ""trips"").
   - We know it is not in position 5 (from ""group"").
   - The only positions left are 1 and 3? But position 3 is O (from ""group"" feedback: O is correct at position 3). So P cannot be at position 3 because that would conflict with O? 

   Therefore, the only position left for P is position 1.

   So we are confident.

   We guess ""PROWL"".

<guess>prowl</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C(✗), R(✓), A(✗), N(✗), E(✗)  
   → **R** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 2**.  
   → C, A, N, E are **absent**.

2. **Guess 2: ""trips""**  
   - T(✗), R(✓), I(✗), P(➖), S(✗)  
   → **R** is still **correct at position 2**.  
   → **P** is present but **not at position 4**.  
   → T, I, S are **absent**.

3. **Guess 3: ""group""**  
   - G(✗), R(✓), O(✓), U(✗), P(➖)  
   → **R** is **correct at position 2**, **O** is **correct at position 3**.  
   → **P** is present but **not at position 5**.  
   → G, U are **absent**.

### Key Deductions:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R O _ _` (positions 2 and 3 are fixed as **R** and **O**).
- **P must be in position 1**:  
  - P is in the word (from Guess 2 and 3) but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (ruled out by feedback).  
  - Position 2 is R and position 3 is O, so P **must** be in position 1.  
  → Secret word starts with **P**: `P R O _ _`.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U (cannot be used).
- **Available letters for positions 4–5**: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, W, X, Y, Z (no duplicates, as feedback shows no repeats so far).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- We know the word starts with **PRO**, so we need to test **two new letters** for positions 4–5.
- Prioritize common consonants (e.g., L, W, F) to maximize information if the guess is incorrect.
- **Top word candidates** (fitting `PRO__` and avoiding forbidden letters):
  - **PROWL**: Tests **W** (position 4) and **L** (position 5).  
  - **PROXY**: Tests **X** (position 4) and **Y** (position 5).  
  - **PROOF**: Tests double **O** (position 4) and **F** (position 5).  
- **Why ""prowl""?**  
  - Uses common letters **W** and **L** (more frequent than X/Y in English).  
  - Avoids less common letters and double letters (unlike ""PROOF"").  
  - If incorrect, feedback on W/L will narrow options significantly.",Guess 4: prowl -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess:
 ""crane"" -> C: x, R: ✓, A: x, N: x, E: x

 Interpretation:
 - The letter 'R' is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
 - Letters 'C', 'A', 'N', 'E' are not in the secret word at all.

 So, we know:
 - The second letter of the secret word is 'R'.
 - The secret word does not contain the letters: C, A, N, E.

 We have 6 tries, and this is the second try.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
   - Has 'R' in the second position.
   - Does not contain C, A, N, E.

 Additionally, we want to try to include other common letters to get more information.

 Common consonants besides R (which we already have) include: L, T, S, B, D, etc.
 Common vowels: We know A and E are out, so we can use I, O, U.

 Let's think of words that fit:
   _ R _ _ _

 Since we don't know other letters, we can try to cover more common letters.

 Example words: 
   We could consider ""PRICK"", but we don't know if P is safe? However, from the previous feedback we know that C is not in the word, so we can't use C.

 Actually, we know the forbidden letters: C, A, N, E. So any letter except these.

 Let's list some possibilities:
   Words with R in the second position: brick, bring, brisk, broad, broke, brown, brush, draft, drink, drive, drown, fruit, ... 

 But note: 
   - We cannot use any of the forbidden letters: A, C, N, E.

 Filter:
   brick: B, R, I, C, K -> contains C -> not allowed. Wait, but we know C is not in the word? Actually, we can use a word that has C? 
   But note: the rule says we must guess a valid 5-letter English word. However, using a letter that we know is not in the word (like C) would waste an opportunity to test other letters.

 It's strategically better to use a word that only uses letters that could potentially be in the word. So we avoid C, A, N, E.

 Therefore, ""brick"" is invalid because it has C? Actually, no, we can still use it as a guess? But it would be inefficient because we know C isn't in the word.

 Let me check: the feedback says C is not in the word. So if I guess a word with C, the feedback will show C with an 'x' again, which we already know. It's not giving new information.

 So, I should avoid using C, A, N, E.

 Now, back to words with R in the second position and without C, A, N, E.

 Possible words:
   - Using I: ""BRISK"", ""BRING"" -> but BRING has G? And we don't know about G? Also, BRING has N? N is forbidden -> wait, BRING: letters B,R,I,N,G -> N is forbidden so we cannot use N? Actually, we can use the word even if it contains forbidden letters? Yes, but it's not advised because:

   The game allows any valid English word. However, guessing a word that contains a letter we know is not present will not help us because that letter will get an 'x', and we already know it's not in the word.

   So to maximize information, we should choose a word that uses only letters that are not ruled out and are common.

   Therefore, let's look for words that:
        Position 2: R
        Letters: only from the remaining alphabet (not C, A, N, E)

   Examples:
        Try a word with O: ""BROOD"" -> but has double O? Let's find better ones.

        Better: ""BROAD""? But BROAD has A -> forbidden.

        ""BROIL"": B, R, O, I, L -> all allowed? Letters: B, O, I, L are not forbidden? Yes, because forbidden are C, A, N, E. So BROIL is a candidate.

        ""FRUIT"": F, R, U, I, T -> forbidden? F, R, U, I, T: no forbidden letters.

        ""GRIMY"": G, R, I, M, Y -> okay.

        ""DRUID"": D, R, U, I, D -> double letter? Also allowed.

    But note: we don't want to repeat the mistake of using a word with double letters unless necessary? Not necessarily bad.

    However, we also want to cover as many new letters as possible.

    Let me list common letters we haven't tested: 
        Not used yet: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

    We have 5 positions: first, third, fourth, fifth.

    We know the second is R.

    We can try to include several of these common letters.

    Common letters to test: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

    Consider ""PRISM"": P, R, I, S, M -> but P is not forbidden? And we know R is already in place? However, note that in ""PRISM"", R is in the second position? Yes.

    But wait: we know the second letter is R, so any word we choose must have R as the second letter.

    So let's build:

        First letter: can be any letter except C, A, N, E -> let's choose a common consonant: S, T, B, P, etc.
        Third letter: vowel, e.g., I, O, U? Or consonant? We don't know much.

    Another idea: use a word that has many common letters and R in the second position.

    Some top candidates:

        ""STRIP"": S, T, R, I, P -> but positions: 
            Position1: S, Position2: R? Wait, no: STRIP is S-T-R-I-P -> so R is the third letter? Doesn't work.

    We need R as the second letter.

    So: words like `_ R _ _ _`.

    ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, O, U are new. But double T? It might be inefficient.

    ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> okay.

    ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H -> okay.

    ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> okay.

    ""DRIFT"": D, R, I, F, T -> okay.

    All these avoid C, A, N, E.

    Now, which one gives the most information? 

    We want to maximize the number of common letters we test.

    Let me choose ""BRUSH"": letters B, R, U, S, H.

    Why ""BRUSH""? 
        - B: common consonant
        - U: vowel (since we lost A and E, U might be useful)
        - S: very common
        - H: fairly common

    Alternatively, ""TRIPS"": but T, R, I, P, S -> R is the second? T R I P S -> that works? T (1st), R (2nd), I (3rd), P (4th), S (5th). Yes.

    But note: we know the second letter is R, so we can use any word that has R in the second position.

    ""TRIPS"" is T-R-I-P-S -> that fits.

    However, ""TRIPS"" avoids forbidden letters? T, R, I, P, S -> yes.

    Similarly, ""CRISP"": but C is forbidden -> invalid.

    So, ""TRIPS"" is a candidate.

    Now, comparing ""TRIPS"" vs ""BRUSH"":
        ""TRIPS"": letters: T, R, I, P, S -> all new except R, which we are reusing but that's okay because we know it's correct and we can confirm position? Actually, we already know R is in the correct position, so we expect a ✓ on R again.

        Which one tests more common letters? 
            TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> common letters: T, I, P, S are all common.
            BRUSH: B, R, U, S, H -> B, U, S, H: S is common, B is common, U and H are less common.

        So ""TRIPS"" might be better.

    Also, consider vowel: we haven't tested I or U. I is more common than U.

    Another candidate: ""ORBIT""? But O is in the first position? O-R-B-I-T -> okay, but note O is not forbidden? And we can use it.

    However, I think ""TRIPS"" is solid.

    But wait: the word must have R in the second position. ""ORBIT"": O-R-B-I-T -> so R is second? Yes.

    However, ""TRIPS"" uses the letter T at the beginning and S at the end.

    I decide to go with ""TRIPS"".

    Why not ""DRIVE""? But E is forbidden? Yes, but DRIVE has E -> so invalid.

    So, ""TRIPS"" is valid.

    Let me confirm: 
        T: not C,A,N,E -> okay.
        R: okay (and we know it's in the word and in position 2).
        I: okay.
        P: okay.
        S: okay.

    So ""TRIPS"" is a valid English word without forbidden letters.

    We'll guess ""TRIPS"".

    However, note: if the secret word has any of T, I, P, S, we'll get feedback.

    We hope to get more information.

    Alternatively, we could use a word with O? Like ""PROUD"" (P,R,O,U,D). But U and D are less common? Or ""GROUT""?

    But let's stick with ""TRIPS"".

<guess>trips</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **R** is correct and in the right position (2nd letter).
- **C, A, N, E** are not in the secret word.

For this guess (second attempt):
- I must include **R** in the **second position**.
- I must avoid using **C, A, N, E** to maximize information.
- I prioritized testing new common letters (**T, I, P, S**) while keeping R fixed in position 2.

I chose **""trips""** because:
- It covers frequent consonants (T, P, S) and a vowel (I), all untested.
- It avoids forbidden letters.
- As an English word, it meets game rules.

Next, I'll analyze feedback from this guess to inform my third attempt.

<guess>trips</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) P(-) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: ""trips""
- T: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, same as before)
- I: x (not in word)
- P: - (in word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in word)

So, what we know so far:
- The second letter is R.
- The letter P is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since in ""trips"" it was in the fourth and got a dash).
- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.
- Therefore, the word contains R (at position 2) and P (somewhere not at position 4), and does not contain C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has R in the second position.
- Includes the letter P (but not in the fourth position).
- Avoids the letters: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

Available letters: We can use any letter except the forbidden ones. The forbidden letters are: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.

So, the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: P is already known to be in the word, so we should include it.

We also know that P is not in position 4. So in our new guess, we can put P in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but not 4, and position 2 is R).

We want to maximize information by testing new common letters.

Common letters among the available ones: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, Y.

We already know P is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? But we need to find its position. So we should try to put P in a different position to test.

Possible positions for P: 1, 3, or 5.

We can also try to cover other vowels. The only vowel left that we haven't tested and is available is O, U, and sometimes Y. We know A, E, I are out.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern: _ R _ _ _

And include P (not in position 4) and avoid forbidden letters.

Some ideas:

- If we put P in position 1: P R _ _ _
  - Then we need to fill the last three positions with available letters (not C,A,N,E,T,I,S) and including other new letters.
  - Example: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> but we have to check: O and U are vowels, D is consonant. But note: we don't know if O or U are in the word? So it's good to test.
  - However, in ""PROUD"", P is at position 1, which is new. And we have O, U, D to test.

- If we put P in position 3: _ R P _ _
  - Example: ""ORPHAN"" -> but H is allowed? Yes, but we have to check the letters: O, R, P, H, A -> A is forbidden! So invalid.
  - Another: ""CRUMP"" -> C is forbidden. Invalid.
  - ""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P -> but P is at position 5? Wait, let's see: position 1: G, 2: R, 3: U, 4: M, 5: P -> so P is at 5, not 3. So that doesn't put P at 3.

  Actually, for position 3: we need a word like _ R P _ _
  Example: ""WRAPS"" -> W, R, A, P, S -> but A and S are forbidden. Invalid.

  Another: ""DRUMP"" is not a word.

  How about ""CRIMP""? C is forbidden.

  It's hard to find a word with P in position 3 without using forbidden letters.

- If we put P in position 5: _ R _ _ P
  Example: ""BROMP"" not a word. ""GRAMP"" not a word. ""FRUMP"" -> F, R, U, M, P -> that's a word? Frump means to be sullen or sulky. It's acceptable? Let me check: yes, it's a valid word.

  But note: we are avoiding forbidden letters? F, R, U, M, P: none of these are forbidden. So ""FRUMP"" is a candidate.

  However, we are testing F, U, M, and P (which we know is in the word, but we are testing its position).

But let's go back to the first option: putting P in position 1.

Candidate: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> letters: P, O, U, D. We know P is in the word, so we are testing O, U, D.

But note: in ""PROUD"", P is at position 1. We don't know if P can be at position 1? It might be, because we only know it's not at position 4.

Another candidate: ""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W, L -> tests O, W, L.

But we have to avoid S, which we are.

Another: ""PROBE"" -> but E is forbidden.

""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> double O? It's allowed, but we might get less information.

""PROUD"" seems good.

But we also have the option of putting P at the end.

Another idea: since we know P is in the word and not at position 4, we can try to put it at position 1 or 5 to see if it fits there.

But we also want to test other common letters.

Let me list some words:

- ""PROUD"": P, R, O, U, D
- ""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L
- ""PRONG"": P, R, O, N, G -> but N is forbidden! So invalid.
- ""PRANK"": P, R, A, N, K -> A and N forbidden.
- ""FRUMP"": F, R, U, M, P -> P at the end.

Also, ""GROUP"": G, R, O, U, P -> but P is at the end? G R O U P -> position 1: G, 2: R, 3: O, 4: U, 5: P. So P is at 5. And it avoids forbidden letters? G, R, O, U, P: all allowed. And ""GROUP"" is a valid word.

So ""GROUP"" is a candidate.

Now, comparing ""PROUD"" and ""GROUP"":
- Both have O and U, but in different positions.
- ""PROUD"" has P at position 1, D at 5.
- ""GROUP"" has G at position 1, P at 5.

We don't know which is better. But note that in ""GROUP"", we are putting P at position 5, which is a new position to test. Similarly, in ""PROUD"", we test P at position 1.

We also haven't tested G, D, F, etc.

But let's think about the feedback we got for P: in ""trips"", P was at position 4 and got a dash, meaning it's in the word but not at 4. So it could be at 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 2 is R, so it can't be there. So P must be at 1, 3, or 5.

By putting P at 1 in ""PROUD"" or at 5 in ""GROUP"", we are testing one of these positions.

We can also consider words that put P at position 3? But we had trouble finding one.

Another candidate: ""CRUMP"" is invalid because of C. ""DRUMP"" not a word. ""TRUMP"" has T, which is forbidden. ""WRAPS"" has A and S.

How about ""HARPY""? But H, A, R, P, Y -> A is forbidden.

It's difficult. So let's stick with either ""PROUD"" or ""GROUP"".

I think ""GROUP"" is a good choice because it tests G and also puts P at the end, which is a new position.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't repeat the vowels? But we don't have many vowel options.

Another candidate: ""PROXY"" -> P, R, O, X, Y -> but X and Y are less common, but it's valid. And it tests X and Y.

But we might prefer more common letters.

I think ""GROUP"" is better because G is a common consonant.

So I'll go with ""GROUP"".

But let's confirm the letters: G, R, O, U, P. 
- G: not forbidden? Yes.
- R: in position 2, correct.
- O: not forbidden? Yes.
- U: not forbidden? Yes.
- P: in the word, and we are testing position 5.

So, we guess ""GROUP"".

But note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries.

Alternatively, we could try to cover more letters? But ""GROUP"" covers G, O, U, and P (which we know).

Another idea: what about ""BROMP""? Not a word. ""DROOP"" -> D, R, O, O, P -> double O? And P at the end. But we can use it? ""DROOP"" is a word. But it has double O, which might be less informative.

I think ""GROUP"" is fine.

So, <guess>group</guess>After analyzing the feedback:

- **R** is confirmed in position 2 (✓ in both guesses).
- **P** is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""trips"" feedback: P(-)).
- **C, A, N, E, T, I, S** are absent (all marked ""x"").
- The secret word must have **R** in position 2, include **P** (not in position 4), and avoid forbidden letters.

For this guess (third attempt):
- I prioritized testing **P** in a new position (position 5) to locate it.
- I chose **""group""** because:
  - It places **R** correctly in position 2.
  - It moves **P** to position 5 (testing if it belongs there).
  - It introduces new common letters: **G** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **U** (position 4).
  - All letters (G, R, O, U, P) are allowed (none are forbidden).
- This maximizes information by testing three new letters while leveraging known constraints.

<guess>group</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) P(-) S(x)
Guess 3: group -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) P(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
  - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""trips"" -> T(x), R(✓), I(x), P(-), S(x)
  - R is still correct in position 2.
  - P is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it was guessed in position 4 and got a dash).
  - T, I, S are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""group"" -> G(x), R(✓), O(✓), U(x), P(-)
  - R and O are correct: R in position 2, O in position 3 (since in ""group"", O is the 3rd letter and got a check).
  - P is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was guessed in position 5 and got a dash).
  - G and U are not in the word.

So, what we know now:

1. The word has the following pattern: _ R O _ _ 
   - Because from ""group"", we have R(✓) at position 2 and O(✓) at position 3.

2. The letter P is in the word, but it is not in position 4 (from ""trips"") and not in position 5 (from ""group""). 
   - Therefore, P must be in position 1 (since position 2 is R and position 3 is O, so only positions 1, 4, and 5 are left, but we've ruled out 4 and 5). 
   - However, we have only 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is R and position 3 is O, so P cannot be there. We have tested P in positions 4 and 5 and got dashes, meaning it is in the word but not in those positions. Therefore, the only position left for P is position 1.

3. Therefore, the word must start with P? But wait, we haven't tested P in position 1 yet. We have only tested it in positions 4 and 5. So it must be in position 1? 

   Let me confirm: 
   - The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.
   - We know: 
        Position 2: R
        Position 3: O
   - P is in the word, but not in position 4 (from ""trips"") and not in position 5 (from ""group""). 
   - Therefore, the only positions left are 1 and ... but we have position 1 and that's it? Because 2 and 3 are taken by R and O, and 4 and 5 are ruled out for P. So P must be in position 1.

   However, we must consider that P might be in position 1, but we haven't tested it there. So we can test it.

   But note: we also have to fill position 4 and 5.

4. Additionally, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U.

   Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U.

   So available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

   But note: P is in the word, so we don't need to test it again? But we are going to put it in position 1.

5. Therefore, the word must be: P R O _ _

   And we need to fill the last two positions with letters from the available set, and they must form a valid English word.

   Also, note that we have not tested many letters, so we should try to use common letters for positions 4 and 5.

6. Now, what are possible words? 

   Pattern: ""PRO__""

   We need two letters for the last two positions, from the available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: P is already used at the start, but it can be repeated? In Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, we haven't seen any indication of repetition so far, and in the feedback, we haven't had any duplicate letters in guesses, so we don't know. But we should consider the possibility.)

   However, in our case, we know P is in the word, and we are putting it at position 1. But if the word has two P's, then we might have P elsewhere? But we have already tested positions 4 and 5 for P and got dashes, meaning that if there is only one P, then it must be at 1. But if there are two P's, then one is at 1 and the other could be at 4 or 5? But the feedback for ""group"" and ""trips"" only showed one P? 

   Let me check the feedback:

   - In ""trips"", we had P in position 4 and got a dash, meaning that there is at least one P in the word, but not at 4. It doesn't say anything about other positions. Similarly, in ""group"", P in position 5 got a dash, meaning not at 5. But if the word had two P's, then we might have one at 1 and one at 4 or 5? But we got dashes for 4 and 5, so if there is a P at 4 or 5, it would have been marked as present (dash) only if it is in the word but wrong position? But we got dashes, meaning that there is a P, but not at that position. So if there is a P at 4, then when we guessed ""trips"" with P at 4, it would have been a check? But it was a dash, so there is no P at 4. Similarly, no P at 5. Therefore, the only position left for P is 1. And if there is only one P, then that's it.

   So we assume the word is ""PRO__"" with two more letters.

7. Now, list possible words:

   We need to find words that start with ""PRO"" and then two letters from the available set (B, D, F, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and avoid the forbidden letters.

   Common words:

   - PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> W and L are available? Yes. But we haven't tested W or L. So it's a candidate.

   - PROBE: but E is forbidden.

   - PROOF: O is repeated? But we don't know if O is repeated. However, we have O in position 3, so if we put O again, it would be a repeat. But the feedback for ""group"" had only one O and it was marked correct? It doesn't tell us if there is another O. But we can use it? However, ""PROOF"" has O at position 3 and 4? Pattern: P R O O F -> but we have position 3 as O, and then position 4 as O. But we don't know if the word has two O's. Also, F is available.

   But note: in ""group"", we had O at position 3 and it was correct. If the word had another O, say at position 4, then when we guessed ""group"" (which has U at position 4, not O), we wouldn't have known about the second O. So it's possible.

   However, we are to avoid forbidden letters. F is not forbidden? Yes.

   But let's list:

   - PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> available letters: W and L are allowed.
   - PROD: but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So no.
   - PROFS: but S is forbidden.
   - PROLE: E is forbidden.
   - PROM: too short.
   - PRONG: N is forbidden.
   - PROUD: U is forbidden? Yes, from ""group"" feedback, U is not in the word.

   So ""PROUD"" is invalid.

   - PROWL and PROOF are candidates.

   Also, ""PROXY"": P, R, O, X, Y -> X and Y are available? Yes.

   And ""PROHM""? Not a word.

   ""PROEM"": E is forbidden.

   ""PROSO"": S and O? S is forbidden.

   ""PROLL"": not a common word? But let's check: ""proll"" is not standard. We should stick to common words.

   So the common ones are: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

   Now, we have to choose one. We want to maximize information? But we are in a good position because we have the first three letters. We just need to find the last two.

   However, we have only 3 guesses left (this is the fourth guess, and we have 6 total, so 3 more after this? Wait, we are on the fourth guess now? Let me count:

        Guess 1: crane
        Guess 2: trips
        Guess 3: group
        Now we are making guess 4.

   We have 3 guesses left? Actually, 6 total, so after this, 2 left.

   But we can try to guess the word.

   We have three candidates: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

   We also have to consider that we might not have thought of all words. But let's see.

   Another one: ""PROVE"": but E is forbidden.

   ""PROKE"": not common and E is forbidden.

   ""PROMY""? Not a word.

   ""PROZY""? Not a word.

   ""PROBF"": not a word.

   So the main ones are PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.

   Now, which one to choose? We can pick one and see.

   But note: we haven't tested the letters W, L, F, X, Y.

   We can choose ""PROXY"" because it tests X and Y, which are less common, so if it's not the word, we get information about X and Y.

   Alternatively, ""PROWL"" tests W and L.

   ""PROOF"" tests F and also tests if there is a double O.

   However, we already know O is in the word at position 3, so if we use ""PROOF"", we are testing if there is an O at position 4? But we don't have any information about position 4 yet.

   But note: if the word is ""PROOF"", then we would get O at position 4 as correct? But we are guessing it.

   Since we have limited guesses, we might as well guess one of these.

   But let's think: the feedback from ""group"" told us that O is at position 3. It doesn't tell us about other O's. So if we guess ""PROOF"", and the word is ""PROWL"", then we would get:

        P: ✓ (because we put it at 1, and it should be correct if the word is PROWL? But wait, if the word is PROWL, then P is at 1? Yes, so it would be correct.

        R: ✓
        O: ✓ (at position 3)
        O: ? at position 4: if the word is PROWL, then position 4 is W, so the second O in ""PROOF"" would be an O at position 4, which is not in the word? So it would be an 'x'? But wait, the word PROWL has no O at position 4, so the second O in ""PROOF"" would be marked as not in the word? But we already have one O in the word? 

   Actually, the feedback for duplicate letters: if the word has one O, and we guess two O's, then one O (the one in the correct position) would be a check, and the other O would be an x if the word doesn't have a second O.

   So if we guess ""PROOF"" and the word is ""PROWL"", we would get:

        P: ✓
        R: ✓
        O: ✓ (position 3)
        O: x (because there is no second O in the word)
        F: x (if the word is PROWL, which has L at the end, not F)

   This would tell us that the last two letters are not O and F, but we would know that the first three are PRO, and then we have to figure out the last two.

   Alternatively, if we guess ""PROWL"" and the word is ""PROOF"", we would get:

        P: ✓
        R: ✓
        O: ✓
        W: x (not in word)
        L: x (not in word)

   Then we would know that the last two are not W and L, and we might try ""PROOF"" next.

   But we can also consider that we have only two more guesses after this, so we want to maximize the chance of getting it right or getting information.

   Another idea: we can choose a word that uses two new letters that are common, so that if it's not the word, we get information about more letters.

   For example, ""PROWL"" uses W and L, which are common. ""PROXY"" uses X and Y, which are less common. ""PROOF"" uses F and a double O.

   Since we are not sure, I think we should go with ""PROWL"" because W and L are more common than X and Y, and we might get more information.

   But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters, and we are.

   Alternatively, we can think of a word that uses two letters that we haven't tested and are common, but also might be in the word.

   But I think ""PROWL"" is a good choice.

   However, let me check if there are other words we haven't considered.

   What about ""PROHM""? Not a word.

   ""PROVE"": E forbidden.

   ""PRUDE"": U and E forbidden.

   ""PRIME"": I and E forbidden.

   So I think the main options are the three I mentioned.

   I'll go with ""PROWL"".

   But wait: we have to make sure that we are not missing something. The word could be ""PROUD"", but U is forbidden, so no.

   Another word: ""PROBE"" is out because of E.

   ""PRONE"": E and N forbidden.

   So, I think ""PROWL"" is a valid guess.

   Therefore, we guess ""PROWL"".

   But note: we are putting P at position 1. We haven't tested it there, but we deduced it must be there. If we are wrong, then we get feedback that P is not at position 1? But then we have a problem because we thought it must be. 

   Let me double-check the deduction:

   - We know P is in the word (from ""trips"" and ""group"").
   - We know it is not in position 4 (from ""trips"").
   - We know it is not in position 5 (from ""group"").
   - The only positions left are 1 and 3? But position 3 is O (from ""group"" feedback: O is correct at position 3). So P cannot be at position 3 because that would conflict with O? 

   Therefore, the only position left for P is position 1.

   So we are confident.

   We guess ""PROWL"".

<guess>prowl</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
   - C(✗), R(✓), A(✗), N(✗), E(✗)  
   → **R** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 2**.  
   → C, A, N, E are **absent**.

2. **Guess 2: ""trips""**  
   - T(✗), R(✓), I(✗), P(➖), S(✗)  
   → **R** is still **correct at position 2**.  
   → **P** is present but **not at position 4**.  
   → T, I, S are **absent**.

3. **Guess 3: ""group""**  
   - G(✗), R(✓), O(✓), U(✗), P(➖)  
   → **R** is **correct at position 2**, **O** is **correct at position 3**.  
   → **P** is present but **not at position 5**.  
   → G, U are **absent**.

### Key Deductions:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R O _ _` (positions 2 and 3 are fixed as **R** and **O**).
- **P must be in position 1**:  
  - P is in the word (from Guess 2 and 3) but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (ruled out by feedback).  
  - Position 2 is R and position 3 is O, so P **must** be in position 1.  
  → Secret word starts with **P**: `P R O _ _`.
- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U (cannot be used).
- **Available letters for positions 4–5**: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, W, X, Y, Z (no duplicates, as feedback shows no repeats so far).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- We know the word starts with **PRO**, so we need to test **two new letters** for positions 4–5.
- Prioritize common consonants (e.g., L, W, F) to maximize information if the guess is incorrect.
- **Top word candidates** (fitting `PRO__` and avoiding forbidden letters):
  - **PROWL**: Tests **W** (position 4) and **L** (position 5).  
  - **PROXY**: Tests **X** (position 4) and **Y** (position 5).  
  - **PROOF**: Tests double **O** (position 4) and **F** (position 5).  
- **Why ""prowl""?**  
  - Uses common letters **W** and **L** (more frequent than X/Y in English).  
  - Avoids less common letters and double letters (unlike ""PROOF"").  
  - If incorrect, feedback on W/L will narrow options significantly.

Yes.\n\n    But wait: we know the second letter is R, so any word we choose must have R as the second letter.\n\n    So let\'s build:\n\n        First letter: can be any letter except C, A, N, E -> let\'s choose a common consonant: S, T, B, P, etc.\n        Third letter: vowel, e.g., I, O, U? Or consonant? We don\'t know much.\n\n    Another idea: use a word that has many common letters and R in the second position.\n\n    Some top candidates:\n\n        ""STRIP"": S, T, R, I, P -> but positions: \n            Position1: S, Position2: R? Wait, no: STRIP is S-T-R-I-P -> so R is the third letter? Doesn\'t work.\n\n    We need R as the second letter.\n\n    So: words like `_ R _ _ _`.\n\n    ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, O, U are new. But double T? It might be inefficient.\n\n    ""SPRIG"": S, P, R, I, G -> okay.\n\n    ""BRUSH"": B, R, U, S, H -> okay.\n\n    ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> okay.\n\n    ""DRIFT"": D, R, I, F, T -> okay.\n\n    All these avoid C, A, N, E.\n\n    Now, which one gives the most information? \n\n    We want to maximize the number of common letters we test.\n\n    Let me choose ""BRUSH"": letters B, R, U, S, H.\n\n    Why ""BRUSH""? \n        - B: common consonant\n        - U: vowel (since we lost A and E, U might be useful)\n        - S: very common\n        - H: fairly common\n\n    Alternatively, ""TRIPS"": but T, R, I, P, S -> R is the second? T R I P S -> that works? T (1st), R (2nd), I (3rd), P (4th), S (5th). Yes.\n\n    But note: we know the second letter is R, so we can use any word that has R in the second position.\n\n    ""TRIPS"" is T-R-I-P-S -> that fits.\n\n    However, ""TRIPS"" avoids forbidden letters? T, R, I, P, S -> yes.\n\n    Similarly, ""CRISP"": but C is forbidden -> invalid.\n\n    So, ""TRIPS"" is a candidate.\n\n    Now, comparing ""TRIPS"" vs ""BRUSH"":\n        ""TRIPS"": letters: T, R, I, P, S -> all new except R, which we are reusing but that\'s okay because we know it\'s correct and we can confirm position? Actually, we already know R is in the correct position, so we expect a ✓ on R again.\n\n        Which one tests more common letters? \n            TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S -> common letters: T, I, P, S are all common.\n            BRUSH: B, R, U, S, H -> B, U, S, H: S is common, B is common, U and H are less common.\n\n        So ""TRIPS"" might be better.\n\n    Also, consider vowel: we haven\'t tested I or U. I is more common than U.\n\n    Another candidate: ""ORBIT""? But O is in the first position? O-R-B-I-T -> okay, but note O is not forbidden? And we can use it.\n\n    However, I think ""TRIPS"" is solid.\n\n    But wait: the word must have R in the second position. ""ORBIT"": O-R-B-I-T -> so R is second? Yes.\n\n    However, ""TRIPS"" uses the letter T at the beginning and S at the end.\n\n    I decide to go with ""TRIPS"".\n\n    Why not ""DRIVE""? But E is forbidden? Yes, but DRIVE has E -> so invalid.\n\n    So, ""TRIPS"" is valid.\n\n    Let me confirm: \n        T: not C,A,N,E -> okay.\n        R: okay (and we know it\'s in the word and in position 2).\n        I: okay.\n        P: okay.\n        S: okay.\n\n    So ""TRIPS"" is a valid English word without forbidden letters.\n\n    We\'ll guess ""TRIPS"".\n\n    However, note: if the secret word has any of T, I, P, S, we\'ll get feedback.\n\n    We hope to get more information.\n\n    Alternatively, we could use a word with O? Like ""PROUD"" (P,R,O,U,D). But U and D are less common? Or ""GROUT""?\n\n    But let\'s stick with ""TRIPS"".\n\n<guess>trips</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **R** is correct and in the right position (2nd letter).\n- **C, A, N, E** are not in the secret word.\n\nFor this guess (second attempt):\n- I must include **R** in the **second position**.\n- I must avoid using **C, A, N, E** to maximize information.\n- I prioritized testing new common letters (**T, I, P, S**) while keeping R fixed in position 2.\n\nI chose **""trips""** because:\n- It covers frequent consonants (T, P, S) and a vowel (I), all untested.\n- It avoids forbidden letters.\n- As an English word, it meets game rules.\n\nNext, I\'ll analyze feedback from this guess to inform my third attempt.\n\n<guess>trips</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) P(-) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: ""trips""\n- T: x (not in word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, same as before)\n- I: x (not in word)\n- P: - (in word but wrong position)\n- S: x (not in word)\n\nSo, what we know so far:\n- The second letter is R.\n- The letter P is in the word, but not in the fourth position (since in ""trips"" it was in the fourth and got a dash).\n- The following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.\n- Therefore, the word contains R (at position 2) and P (somewhere not at position 4), and does not contain C, A, N, E, T, I, S.\n\nWe need to form a new 5-letter word that:\n- Has R in the second position.\n- Includes the letter P (but not in the fourth position).\n- Avoids the letters: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use any letter except the forbidden ones. The forbidden letters are: C, A, N, E, T, I, S.\n\nSo, the available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: P is already known to be in the word, so we should include it.\n\nWe also know that P is not in position 4. So in our new guess, we can put P in positions 1, 3, or 5 (but not 4, and position 2 is R).\n\nWe want to maximize information by testing new common letters.\n\nCommon letters among the available ones: B, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, U, Y.\n\nWe already know P is in the word, so we don\'t need to test it again? But we need to find its position. So we should try to put P in a different position to test.\n\nPossible positions for P: 1, 3, or 5.\n\nWe can also try to cover other vowels. The only vowel left that we haven\'t tested and is available is O, U, and sometimes Y. We know A, E, I are out.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern: _ R _ _ _\n\nAnd include P (not in position 4) and avoid forbidden letters.\n\nSome ideas:\n\n- If we put P in position 1: P R _ _ _\n  - Then we need to fill the last three positions with available letters (not C,A,N,E,T,I,S) and including other new letters.\n  - Example: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> but we have to check: O and U are vowels, D is consonant. But note: we don\'t know if O or U are in the word? So it\'s good to test.\n  - However, in ""PROUD"", P is at position 1, which is new. And we have O, U, D to test.\n\n- If we put P in position 3: _ R P _ _\n  - Example: ""ORPHAN"" -> but H is allowed? Yes, but we have to check the letters: O, R, P, H, A -> A is forbidden! So invalid.\n  - Another: ""CRUMP"" -> C is forbidden. Invalid.\n  - ""GRUMP"" -> G, R, U, M, P -> but P is at position 5? Wait, let\'s see: position 1: G, 2: R, 3: U, 4: M, 5: P -> so P is at 5, not 3. So that doesn\'t put P at 3.\n\n  Actually, for position 3: we need a word like _ R P _ _\n  Example: ""WRAPS"" -> W, R, A, P, S -> but A and S are forbidden. Invalid.\n\n  Another: ""DRUMP"" is not a word.\n\n  How about ""CRIMP""? C is forbidden.\n\n  It\'s hard to find a word with P in position 3 without using forbidden letters.\n\n- If we put P in position 5: _ R _ _ P\n  Example: ""BROMP"" not a word. ""GRAMP"" not a word. ""FRUMP"" -> F, R, U, M, P -> that\'s a word? Frump means to be sullen or sulky. It\'s acceptable? Let me check: yes, it\'s a valid word.\n\n  But note: we are avoiding forbidden letters? F, R, U, M, P: none of these are forbidden. So ""FRUMP"" is a candidate.\n\n  However, we are testing F, U, M, and P (which we know is in the word, but we are testing its position).\n\nBut let\'s go back to the first option: putting P in position 1.\n\nCandidate: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> letters: P, O, U, D. We know P is in the word, so we are testing O, U, D.\n\nBut note: in ""PROUD"", P is at position 1. We don\'t know if P can be at position 1? It might be, because we only know it\'s not at position 4.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W, L -> tests O, W, L.\n\nBut we have to avoid S, which we are.\n\nAnother: ""PROBE"" -> but E is forbidden.\n\n""PROOF"" -> P, R, O, O, F -> double O? It\'s allowed, but we might get less information.\n\n""PROUD"" seems good.\n\nBut we also have the option of putting P at the end.\n\nAnother idea: since we know P is in the word and not at position 4, we can try to put it at position 1 or 5 to see if it fits there.\n\nBut we also want to test other common letters.\n\nLet me list some words:\n\n- ""PROUD"": P, R, O, U, D\n- ""PROWL"": P, R, O, W, L\n- ""PRONG"": P, R, O, N, G -> but N is forbidden! So invalid.\n- ""PRANK"": P, R, A, N, K -> A and N forbidden.\n- ""FRUMP"": F, R, U, M, P -> P at the end.\n\nAlso, ""GROUP"": G, R, O, U, P -> but P is at the end? G R O U P -> position 1: G, 2: R, 3: O, 4: U, 5: P. So P is at 5. And it avoids forbidden letters? G, R, O, U, P: all allowed. And ""GROUP"" is a valid word.\n\nSo ""GROUP"" is a candidate.\n\nNow, comparing ""PROUD"" and ""GROUP"":\n- Both have O and U, but in different positions.\n- ""PROUD"" has P at position 1, D at 5.\n- ""GROUP"" has G at position 1, P at 5.\n\nWe don\'t know which is better. But note that in ""GROUP"", we are putting P at position 5, which is a new position to test. Similarly, in ""PROUD"", we test P at position 1.\n\nWe also haven\'t tested G, D, F, etc.\n\nBut let\'s think about the feedback we got for P: in ""trips"", P was at position 4 and got a dash, meaning it\'s in the word but not at 4. So it could be at 1, 2, 3, or 5. But position 2 is R, so it can\'t be there. So P must be at 1, 3, or 5.\n\nBy putting P at 1 in ""PROUD"" or at 5 in ""GROUP"", we are testing one of these positions.\n\nWe can also consider words that put P at position 3? But we had trouble finding one.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CRUMP"" is invalid because of C. ""DRUMP"" not a word. ""TRUMP"" has T, which is forbidden. ""WRAPS"" has A and S.\n\nHow about ""HARPY""? But H, A, R, P, Y -> A is forbidden.\n\nIt\'s difficult. So let\'s stick with either ""PROUD"" or ""GROUP"".\n\nI think ""GROUP"" is a good choice because it tests G and also puts P at the end, which is a new position.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t repeat the vowels? But we don\'t have many vowel options.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PROXY"" -> P, R, O, X, Y -> but X and Y are less common, but it\'s valid. And it tests X and Y.\n\nBut we might prefer more common letters.\n\nI think ""GROUP"" is better because G is a common consonant.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""GROUP"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the letters: G, R, O, U, P. \n- G: not forbidden? Yes.\n- R: in position 2, correct.\n- O: not forbidden? Yes.\n- U: not forbidden? Yes.\n- P: in the word, and we are testing position 5.\n\nSo, we guess ""GROUP"".\n\nBut note: we are on the third guess, and we have 6 tries.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to cover more letters? But ""GROUP"" covers G, O, U, and P (which we know).\n\nAnother idea: what about ""BROMP""? Not a word. ""DROOP"" -> D, R, O, O, P -> double O? And P at the end. But we can use it? ""DROOP"" is a word. But it has double O, which might be less informative.\n\nI think ""GROUP"" is fine.\n\nSo, <guess>group</guess>After analyzing the feedback:\n\n- **R** is confirmed in position 2 (✓ in both guesses).\n- **P** is in the word but not in position 4 (from ""trips"" feedback: P(-)).\n- **C, A, N, E, T, I, S** are absent (all marked ""x"").\n- The secret word must have **R** in position 2, include **P** (not in position 4), and avoid forbidden letters.\n\nFor this guess (third attempt):\n- I prioritized testing **P** in a new position (position 5) to locate it.\n- I chose **""group""** because:\n  - It places **R** correctly in position 2.\n  - It moves **P** to position 5 (testing if it belongs there).\n  - It introduces new common letters: **G** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **U** (position 4).\n  - All letters (G, R, O, U, P) are allowed (none are forbidden).\n- This maximizes information by testing three new letters while leveraging known constraints.\n\n<guess>group</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) P(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: group -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) P(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)\n  - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd).\n  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""trips"" -> T(x), R(✓), I(x), P(-), S(x)\n  - R is still correct in position 2.\n  - P is in the word but not in the 4th position (since it was guessed in position 4 and got a dash).\n  - T, I, S are not in the word.\n\nGuess 3: ""group"" -> G(x), R(✓), O(✓), U(x), P(-)\n  - R and O are correct: R in position 2, O in position 3 (since in ""group"", O is the 3rd letter and got a check).\n  - P is in the word but not in the 5th position (since it was guessed in position 5 and got a dash).\n  - G and U are not in the word.\n\nSo, what we know now:\n\n1. The word has the following pattern: _ R O _ _ \n   - Because from ""group"", we have R(✓) at position 2 and O(✓) at position 3.\n\n2. The letter P is in the word, but it is not in position 4 (from ""trips"") and not in position 5 (from ""group""). \n   - Therefore, P must be in position 1 (since position 2 is R and position 3 is O, so only positions 1, 4, and 5 are left, but we\'ve ruled out 4 and 5). \n   - However, we have only 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is R and position 3 is O, so P cannot be there. We have tested P in positions 4 and 5 and got dashes, meaning it is in the word but not in those positions. Therefore, the only position left for P is position 1.\n\n3. Therefore, the word must start with P? But wait, we haven\'t tested P in position 1 yet. We have only tested it in positions 4 and 5. So it must be in position 1? \n\n   Let me confirm: \n   - The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n   - We know: \n        Position 2: R\n        Position 3: O\n   - P is in the word, but not in position 4 (from ""trips"") and not in position 5 (from ""group""). \n   - Therefore, the only positions left are 1 and ... but we have position 1 and that\'s it? Because 2 and 3 are taken by R and O, and 4 and 5 are ruled out for P. So P must be in position 1.\n\n   However, we must consider that P might be in position 1, but we haven\'t tested it there. So we can test it.\n\n   But note: we also have to fill position 4 and 5.\n\n4. Additionally, we know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U.\n\n   Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U.\n\n   So available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n   But note: P is in the word, so we don\'t need to test it again? But we are going to put it in position 1.\n\n5. Therefore, the word must be: P R O _ _\n\n   And we need to fill the last two positions with letters from the available set, and they must form a valid English word.\n\n   Also, note that we have not tested many letters, so we should try to use common letters for positions 4 and 5.\n\n6. Now, what are possible words? \n\n   Pattern: ""PRO__""\n\n   We need two letters for the last two positions, from the available letters: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z. (Note: P is already used at the start, but it can be repeated? In Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but we don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, we haven\'t seen any indication of repetition so far, and in the feedback, we haven\'t had any duplicate letters in guesses, so we don\'t know. But we should consider the possibility.)\n\n   However, in our case, we know P is in the word, and we are putting it at position 1. But if the word has two P\'s, then we might have P elsewhere? But we have already tested positions 4 and 5 for P and got dashes, meaning that if there is only one P, then it must be at 1. But if there are two P\'s, then one is at 1 and the other could be at 4 or 5? But the feedback for ""group"" and ""trips"" only showed one P? \n\n   Let me check the feedback:\n\n   - In ""trips"", we had P in position 4 and got a dash, meaning that there is at least one P in the word, but not at 4. It doesn\'t say anything about other positions. Similarly, in ""group"", P in position 5 got a dash, meaning not at 5. But if the word had two P\'s, then we might have one at 1 and one at 4 or 5? But we got dashes for 4 and 5, so if there is a P at 4 or 5, it would have been marked as present (dash) only if it is in the word but wrong position? But we got dashes, meaning that there is a P, but not at that position. So if there is a P at 4, then when we guessed ""trips"" with P at 4, it would have been a check? But it was a dash, so there is no P at 4. Similarly, no P at 5. Therefore, the only position left for P is 1. And if there is only one P, then that\'s it.\n\n   So we assume the word is ""PRO__"" with two more letters.\n\n7. Now, list possible words:\n\n   We need to find words that start with ""PRO"" and then two letters from the available set (B, D, F, H, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z) and avoid the forbidden letters.\n\n   Common words:\n\n   - PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> W and L are available? Yes. But we haven\'t tested W or L. So it\'s a candidate.\n\n   - PROBE: but E is forbidden.\n\n   - PROOF: O is repeated? But we don\'t know if O is repeated. However, we have O in position 3, so if we put O again, it would be a repeat. But the feedback for ""group"" had only one O and it was marked correct? It doesn\'t tell us if there is another O. But we can use it? However, ""PROOF"" has O at position 3 and 4? Pattern: P R O O F -> but we have position 3 as O, and then position 4 as O. But we don\'t know if the word has two O\'s. Also, F is available.\n\n   But note: in ""group"", we had O at position 3 and it was correct. If the word had another O, say at position 4, then when we guessed ""group"" (which has U at position 4, not O), we wouldn\'t have known about the second O. So it\'s possible.\n\n   However, we are to avoid forbidden letters. F is not forbidden? Yes.\n\n   But let\'s list:\n\n   - PROWL: P, R, O, W, L -> available letters: W and L are allowed.\n   - PROD: but that\'s 4 letters? We need 5 letters. So no.\n   - PROFS: but S is forbidden.\n   - PROLE: E is forbidden.\n   - PROM: too short.\n   - PRONG: N is forbidden.\n   - PROUD: U is forbidden? Yes, from ""group"" feedback, U is not in the word.\n\n   So ""PROUD"" is invalid.\n\n   - PROWL and PROOF are candidates.\n\n   Also, ""PROXY"": P, R, O, X, Y -> X and Y are available? Yes.\n\n   And ""PROHM""? Not a word.\n\n   ""PROEM"": E is forbidden.\n\n   ""PROSO"": S and O? S is forbidden.\n\n   ""PROLL"": not a common word? But let\'s check: ""proll"" is not standard. We should stick to common words.\n\n   So the common ones are: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.\n\n   Now, we have to choose one. We want to maximize information? But we are in a good position because we have the first three letters. We just need to find the last two.\n\n   However, we have only 3 guesses left (this is the fourth guess, and we have 6 total, so 3 more after this? Wait, we are on the fourth guess now? Let me count:\n\n        Guess 1: crane\n        Guess 2: trips\n        Guess 3: group\n        Now we are making guess 4.\n\n   We have 3 guesses left? Actually, 6 total, so after this, 2 left.\n\n   But we can try to guess the word.\n\n   We have three candidates: PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.\n\n   We also have to consider that we might not have thought of all words. But let\'s see.\n\n   Another one: ""PROVE"": but E is forbidden.\n\n   ""PROKE"": not common and E is forbidden.\n\n   ""PROMY""? Not a word.\n\n   ""PROZY""? Not a word.\n\n   ""PROBF"": not a word.\n\n   So the main ones are PROWL, PROOF, PROXY.\n\n   Now, which one to choose? We can pick one and see.\n\n   But note: we haven\'t tested the letters W, L, F, X, Y.\n\n   We can choose ""PROXY"" because it tests X and Y, which are less common, so if it\'s not the word, we get information about X and Y.\n\n   Alternatively, ""PROWL"" tests W and L.\n\n   ""PROOF"" tests F and also tests if there is a double O.\n\n   However, we already know O is in the word at position 3, so if we use ""PROOF"", we are testing if there is an O at position 4? But we don\'t have any information about position 4 yet.\n\n   But note: if the word is ""PROOF"", then we would get O at position 4 as correct? But we are guessing it.\n\n   Since we have limited guesses, we might as well guess one of these.\n\n   But let\'s think: the feedback from ""group"" told us that O is at position 3. It doesn\'t tell us about other O\'s. So if we guess ""PROOF"", and the word is ""PROWL"", then we would get:\n\n        P: ✓ (because we put it at 1, and it should be correct if the word is PROWL? But wait, if the word is PROWL, then P is at 1? Yes, so it would be correct.\n\n        R: ✓\n        O: ✓ (at position 3)\n        O: ? at position 4: if the word is PROWL, then position 4 is W, so the second O in ""PROOF"" would be an O at position 4, which is not in the word? So it would be an \'x\'? But wait, the word PROWL has no O at position 4, so the second O in ""PROOF"" would be marked as not in the word? But we already have one O in the word? \n\n   Actually, the feedback for duplicate letters: if the word has one O, and we guess two O\'s, then one O (the one in the correct position) would be a check, and the other O would be an x if the word doesn\'t have a second O.\n\n   So if we guess ""PROOF"" and the word is ""PROWL"", we would get:\n\n        P: ✓\n        R: ✓\n        O: ✓ (position 3)\n        O: x (because there is no second O in the word)\n        F: x (if the word is PROWL, which has L at the end, not F)\n\n   This would tell us that the last two letters are not O and F, but we would know that the first three are PRO, and then we have to figure out the last two.\n\n   Alternatively, if we guess ""PROWL"" and the word is ""PROOF"", we would get:\n\n        P: ✓\n        R: ✓\n        O: ✓\n        W: x (not in word)\n        L: x (not in word)\n\n   Then we would know that the last two are not W and L, and we might try ""PROOF"" next.\n\n   But we can also consider that we have only two more guesses after this, so we want to maximize the chance of getting it right or getting information.\n\n   Another idea: we can choose a word that uses two new letters that are common, so that if it\'s not the word, we get information about more letters.\n\n   For example, ""PROWL"" uses W and L, which are common. ""PROXY"" uses X and Y, which are less common. ""PROOF"" uses F and a double O.\n\n   Since we are not sure, I think we should go with ""PROWL"" because W and L are more common than X and Y, and we might get more information.\n\n   But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters, and we are.\n\n   Alternatively, we can think of a word that uses two letters that we haven\'t tested and are common, but also might be in the word.\n\n   But I think ""PROWL"" is a good choice.\n\n   However, let me check if there are other words we haven\'t considered.\n\n   What about ""PROHM""? Not a word.\n\n   ""PROVE"": E forbidden.\n\n   ""PRUDE"": U and E forbidden.\n\n   ""PRIME"": I and E forbidden.\n\n   So I think the main options are the three I mentioned.\n\n   I\'ll go with ""PROWL"".\n\n   But wait: we have to make sure that we are not missing something. The word could be ""PROUD"", but U is forbidden, so no.\n\n   Another word: ""PROBE"" is out because of E.\n\n   ""PRONE"": E and N forbidden.\n\n   So, I think ""PROWL"" is a valid guess.\n\n   Therefore, we guess ""PROWL"".\n\n   But note: we are putting P at position 1. We haven\'t tested it there, but we deduced it must be there. If we are wrong, then we get feedback that P is not at position 1? But then we have a problem because we thought it must be. \n\n   Let me double-check the deduction:\n\n   - We know P is in the word (from ""trips"" and ""group"").\n   - We know it is not in position 4 (from ""trips"").\n   - We know it is not in position 5 (from ""group"").\n   - The only positions left are 1 and 3? But position 3 is O (from ""group"" feedback: O is correct at position 3). So P cannot be at position 3 because that would conflict with O? \n\n   Therefore, the only position left for P is position 1.\n\n   So we are confident.\n\n   We guess ""PROWL"".\n\n<guess>prowl</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n\n1. **Guess 1: ""crane""**  \n   - C(✗), R(✓), A(✗), N(✗), E(✗)  \n   → **R** is in the word and **correctly placed at position 2**.  \n   → C, A, N, E are **absent**.\n\n2. **Guess 2: ""trips""**  \n   - T(✗), R(✓), I(✗), P(➖), S(✗)  \n   → **R** is still **correct at position 2**.  \n   → **P** is present but **not at position 4**.  \n   → T, I, S are **absent**.\n\n3. **Guess 3: ""group""**  \n   - G(✗), R(✓), O(✓), U(✗), P(➖)  \n   → **R** is **correct at position 2**, **O** is **correct at position 3**.  \n   → **P** is present but **not at position 5**.  \n   → G, U are **absent**.\n\n### Key Deductions:\n- **Secret word pattern**: `_ R O _ _` (positions 2 and 3 are fixed as **R** and **O**).\n- **P must be in position 1**:  \n  - P is in the word (from Guess 2 and 3) but cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (ruled out by feedback).  \n  - Position 2 is R and position 3 is O, so P **must** be in position 1.  \n  → Secret word starts with **P**: `P R O _ _`.\n- **Absent letters**: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U (cannot be used).\n- **Available letters for positions 4–5**: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, W, X, Y, Z (no duplicates, as feedback shows no repeats so far).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- We know the word starts with **PRO**, so we need to test **two new letters** for positions 4–5.\n- Prioritize common consonants (e.g., L, W, F) to maximize information if the guess is incorrect.\n- **Top word candidates** (fitting `PRO__` and avoiding forbidden letters):\n  - **PROWL**: Tests **W** (position 4) and **L** (position 5).  \n  - **PROXY**: Tests **X** (position 4) and **Y** (position 5).  \n  - **PROOF**: Tests double **O** (position 4) and **F** (position 5).  \n- **Why ""prowl""?**  \n  - Uses common letters **W** and **L** (more frequent than X/Y in English).  \n  - Avoids less common letters and double letters (unlike ""PROOF"").  \n  - If incorrect, feedback on W/L will narrow options significantly.\n\n<guess>prowl</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(x) P(-) S(x)\nGuess 3: group -> FEEDBACK: G(x) R(✓) O(✓) U(x) P(-)\nGuess 4: prowl -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) O(✓) W(x) L(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
Guess 2: ""trips"" -> T(x), R(✓), I(x), P(-), S(x)
Guess 3: ""group"" -> G(x), R(✓), O(✓), U(x), P(-)
Guess 4: ""prowl"" -> P(✓), R(✓), O(✓), W(x), L(x)

So, the feedback for ""prowl"":
- P: ✓ (correct position, which we expected at position 1)
- R: ✓ (position 2, as before)
- O: ✓ (position 3, as before)
- W: x (not in the word)
- L: x (not in the word)

Therefore, we now know:
- The word is ""P R O _ _""
- W and L are not in the word.
- Additionally, the absent letters so far: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U, W, L.

We also know that P is in the word and correctly placed at position 1.

Now, what about the letter P? We have it at position 1, and we know it's correct. But note: in previous guesses, we had P in positions 4 and 5 and got dashes, meaning P is present but not there. Now we have it at 1 and it's correct, so that's settled.

Now, we need to find the last two letters. The word is ""PRO__"".

The missing letters must be from the remaining available letters, excluding the absent ones.

Absent letters: C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U, W, L.

So, available letters: B, D, F, H, K, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

But note: we already have P in the word at position 1. We don't know if there are duplicate letters, but so far no indication. Also, in the feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate feedback, so we assume no duplicates for now.

Therefore, we avoid using P again? But it's possible, but let's not assume duplicates unless necessary.

So, for positions 4 and 5, we choose from: B, D, F, H, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z.

Now, what are possible words?

Common words that start with ""PRO"" and have two more letters from the above:

- PROUD: but U is absent (from guess 3, U(x)), so invalid.
- PROBE: E is absent.
- PRONE: E and N absent.
- PROOF: O is already in position 3, so if we use ""PROOF"", it would be P R O O F. But we have O at position 3 and 4? We don't know if the word has two O's. But in guess 3, we had ""group"" which had O only at position 3 and it was correct, but that doesn't tell us about other O's. However, we can consider ""PROOF"".

But let's check the available letters: F is available? Yes, F is not in the absent list.

Similarly, ""PROXY"": X and Y are available.

""PROFS"": but S is absent.

""PROLE"": E absent.

""PROM"": too short.

""PRONG"": N absent.

""PRODD"": not a word.

""PROHM"": not a word.

""PROVE"": E absent.

""PRIVY"": but I and V? I is absent.

So, the only common words left are:

- PROOF: P, R, O, O, F
- PROXY: P, R, O, X, Y
- PROUD: invalid (U absent)
- PROWL: we tried, and W and L are absent.

Also, ""PROSY"": but S is absent.

""PROEM"": E absent.

""PROKE"": not common and E absent.

""PROSO"": S absent.

""PROFY"": not a word.

""PROBF"": not a word.

""PRODD"": not a word.

""PROMS"": S absent.

So, we have two strong candidates: ""PROOF"" and ""PROXY"".

Now, we also have ""PRO"" words with other letters? Like ""PROUD"" is out.

What about ""PROLL""? Not a word.

""PROMM""? No.

""PROBB""? No.

""PRODH""? No.

""PROVY""? Not a word.

""PROZY""? No.

So, it's between ""PROOF"" and ""PROXY"".

Now, we have to choose one. We are on the fifth guess (since we've had four guesses already). We have two guesses left (total 6).

We can try ""PROOF"" first.

But note: if we choose ""PROOF"", and the word is ""PROXY"", we get feedback that the second O is wrong and F is wrong, but we don't get information about X and Y.

Similarly, if we choose ""PROXY"" and the word is ""PROOF"", we get that X and Y are wrong.

But we might get more information from ""PROXY"" because it tests two new letters, whereas ""PROOF"" tests F and also tests for a double O.

However, if the word is ""PROOF"", then in ""PROXY"", we would get:

- P: ✓
- R: ✓
- O: ✓
- X: x (not in word)
- Y: x (not in word)

Then we would know that the last two are not X and Y, and we can guess ""PROOF"" next.

Similarly, if we guess ""PROOF"" and the word is ""PROXY"", we get:

- P: ✓
- R: ✓
- O: ✓
- O: x (if there is no second O) 
- F: x

Then we know that the last two are not O and F, so we can guess ""PROXY"".

But in both cases, we use one more guess to find out.

But we have only two guesses left, so if we guess wrong now, we can still guess once more.

Alternatively, we can think: is there another word we haven't considered?

What about ""PROUD""? No, U is out.

""PRUDE""? U and E out.

""PRIME""? I and E out.

""PRONE""? N and E out.

""PROSE""? S and E out.

""PROBE""? E out.

""PRICE""? I and E out.

I think we've covered.

Another possibility: ""PROVE"" is out because of E.

""PROWL"" we tried.

So, let's choose ""PROXY"" because it tests two less common letters, and if they are absent, we can focus on ""PROOF"".

But note: we have to consider that ""PROOF"" has a double O, which might be more common? But we don't know.

We can also consider ""PROFS"" but S is out.

I think we should go with ""PROOF"" because it's a very common word.

But let's see the feedback from ""prowl"": we got W and L absent, so we add them to the absent list.

Now, for guess 5, I'll go with ""PROOF"".

So, <guess>proof</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

1. **Pattern Confirmed**:  
   - The secret word is **P R O _ _** (positions 1, 2, and 3 are fixed as **P**, **R**, and **O**).  
   - Only positions 4 and 5 remain unknown.

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - From all feedback: **C, A, N, E, T, I, S, G, U, W, L** are not in the word.  
   - Available letters for positions 4–5: **B, D, F, H, K, M, Q, V, X, Y, Z** (no duplicates, as no prior feedback suggests repeats).

3. **Possible Words**:  
   - Common English words fitting `PRO__` and avoiding absent letters:  
     - **PROOF** (tests **F** and double **O** at position 4).  
     - **PROXY** (tests **X** and **Y**).  
     - Other options (e.g., ""PROUD"", ""PROBE"") are invalid due to absent letters.  

4. **Strategy for Guess 5**:  
   - **Why ""proof""?**  
     - Tests **F** (common consonant) and the possibility of a double **O** (position 4).  
     - If incorrect, feedback on **F** and the second **O** will definitively reveal if double **O** is possible, narrowing to **PROXY** or other rare words.  
   - **Risk**: If ""PROXY"" is the answer, we use the 6th guess. But ""PROOF"" is statistically more common than ""PROXY"".
