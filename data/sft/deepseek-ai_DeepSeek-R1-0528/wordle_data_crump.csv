We are starting the game and need to make our first guess.
 For the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback, so we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 A common strategy is to choose a word with five distinct letters and that includes common vowels and consonants.
 Words like ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""SOARE"", ""SALET"", etc., are often used. Let's pick one that covers common letters.

 Looking at common letters in 5-letter words:
 Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)
 Consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 The word ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it has:
  - C, R, A, N, E: which are common letters and includes two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is another common starting word that has been shown to be effective.

 However, I recall that ""RAISE"" is also a popular starting word because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 Let's compare:

 Option 1: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E
 Option 2: ROAST -> R, O, A, S, T (but note that O and A are vowels, and S, T, R are common)
 Option 3: RAISE -> R, A, I, S, E (three vowels: A, I, E and consonants R, S)

 Since we are limited to the first guess and want to cover more vowels and common consonants, I think ""RAISE"" is a strong candidate.

 But note: we must make sure the word exists in the word list.

 I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it covers A, E, I (three common vowels) and R, S (common consonants).

 So, the first guess is ""RAISE"".
</think>
I chose ""RAISE"" as the first guess because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing the likelihood of hitting letters in the secret word. This provides a strong foundation for narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback's ✓, -, and x indicators.

We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the secret word but not in the first position)
  A: x (A is not in the secret word)
  I: x (I is not in the secret word)
  S: x (S is not in the secret word)
  E: x (E is not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the first position.
  - The letters A, I, S, E are not in the secret word at all.

Also, note that the secret word does not contain: A, I, S, E.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Must include the letter R (since we know it's in the word) but not in the first position.
  - Must avoid the letters A, I, S, E.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think about the position of R:
  Since in ""raise"", R was in the first position and got a minus (-), that means R is in the word but not at position 1. So R must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We can try to put R in one of these positions and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

What letters haven't we tried? We have tried R, A, I, S, E. So we should avoid those except R.

Common consonants and vowels we haven't used: 
  Vowels: O, U (and sometimes Y, but we'll avoid Y for now unless necessary)
  Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is R.

We can consider words that have R in the second, third, fourth, or fifth position.

Let's try to think of common words that fit:

Option 1: Put R in the second position. Then the word pattern: _ R _ _ _
  We need to avoid A, I, S, E. So the first letter can be one of the unused consonants or vowels (but note: first letter is often a consonant).

  Example: ""CRUST"" -> but we have to check if it avoids A, I, S, E? 
    C, R, U, S, T -> S is in the word, but we know S is not in the secret word. So we cannot use S.

  We must avoid S, so we cannot use words containing S.

  Another: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. But note: we haven't tried P, O, U, D.

  However, we also know that the secret word has R, so that's covered.

Option 2: Put R in the third position: _ _ R _ _
  Example: ""CHORD"" -> C, H, O, R, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

Option 3: Put R in the fourth position: _ _ _ R _
  Example: ""THORN"" -> T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

Option 4: Put R in the fifth position: _ _ _ _ R
  Example: ""LATER"" -> but LATER has E and R, but E is not allowed. So we need to avoid E. 
  Instead: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R -> but A is not allowed. 
  Another: ""MINOR"" -> has I and A? No, but I is not allowed. 
  So let's try: ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. Also, note that we have 5 positions to fill and we want to test common letters.

Let's list the available letters: we have 21 consonants (excluding R, S) and 2 vowels (O, U) that we haven't tried? Actually, we have more vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y. But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

We can also use Y as a vowel? For example, in words like ""DRYLY"" but that has repeated letters and we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have repeated letters. However, in this feedback, we don't have any information about repeated letters. But since we are avoiding A, I, S, E, and we know R is in the word, we don't know if R appears more than once? But we only have one R so far.

But note: the feedback for ""raise"" only showed one R and it was present (but in wrong position). If there were two R's, then the feedback would have shown two minuses or one correct and one minus? But in this case, we only have one R. So we don't know if there are multiple R's. We should consider that possibility, but for now, we assume at least one R.

We want to maximize information. So we should choose a word that has:
  - R in a position that is not the first (so positions 2,3,4,5)
  - Uses common letters that we haven't tried: for example, T, O, U, L, N, etc.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U ... but we have already ruled out A, I, S, E. So we are left with T, O, N, H, R (but R we know), D, L, U, etc.

So we should try to include T, O, N, H, D, L, U.

But we have only 5 letters. We must include R and avoid A, I, S, E.

Let me try to form a word:

Option: ""ROUTE"" -> but E is not allowed. 
Option: ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And R? We must include R! This word doesn't have R. So we cannot use it.

We must include R.

Another option: ""TROUT"" -> T, R, O, U, T -> has T repeated? That's okay. But note: we have R in the second position. And avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

But we are testing T, R, O, U. That's good.

Another: ""GROUT"" -> G, R, O, U, T -> same as above but with G instead of T at the start. But we haven't tried G.

But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible. ""TROUT"" uses T, R, O, U. We get to test T, O, U (and R we already know). But we are repeating T? Actually, two T's: so we are testing only 4 distinct letters: T, R, O, U.

Similarly, ""GROUT"" tests G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct letters? G, R, O, U, T -> yes, 5 distinct.

So ""GROUT"" might be better because it tests 5 new distinct letters (G, R, O, U, T) and we know R is included.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has G, O, U, T. But that's the point of guessing.

Another candidate: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the fourth position. And tests C, O, U, R, T.

Similarly, ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T -> but no R. So we cannot use that.

We must have R.

Another: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. Tests B, R, O, W, N.

But we haven't tried B, O, W, N.

We can also consider: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. But has M and B.

We have many options. We should choose one that covers common letters and positions.

But note: we also want to cover the position of R. Since we know R is not in position 1, we can try to put R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. We don't know which, so we might want to try a position that we haven't tested? Actually, in the first guess we tested position 1 for R and it was wrong. So we can try a different position.

But we don't have to fix the position of R in this guess? We can try any position as long as it's not position 1? Actually, we can even try position 1 again? But that would be wasteful because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 1.

Let me list some words that have R and avoid A, I, S, E, and put R in positions 2,3,4,5:

- Position 2: words like ""CRUST"" (but has S, not allowed), ""GRUNT"" (G, R, U, N, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""PRONG"" (P, R, O, N, G -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""TRUCK"" (T, R, U, C, K -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 3: ""CHARM"" (but has A, not allowed), ""BORNE"" (has E, not allowed), ""FORTY"" (F, O, R, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""HORDE"" (has E, not allowed), ""WORDY"" (W, O, R, D, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 4: ""ABHOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""ADORE"" (has A and E, not allowed), ""FJORD"" (F, J, O, R, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""THORN"" (T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 5: ""LATER"" (has E, not allowed), ""MANOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""RUMOR"" (R, U, M, O, R -> has R repeated? And we don't know if repeated letters are allowed. But the word is valid. However, we are using R twice. But we know R is in the word, so if the secret word has two R's, that's okay. But we are testing R at the end. Also, the first letter is R, which we know is not in the first position? Wait, we are putting R at the end and also at the beginning? That would be two R's. But we know the first position cannot be R, so if we put R in the first position again, that would be a waste. So we should avoid putting R in the first position.

  Instead, for position 5: ""VAPOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""TUMOR"" (T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

Now, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers multiple positions.

I think ""TROUT"" (with R in position 2) or ""FORTY"" (with R in position 3) or ""THORN"" (with R in position 4) or ""TUMOR"" (with R in position 5) are options.

But let's consider the distinct letters:

- ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, R, O, U (4 distinct, T repeated)
- ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct: G, R, O, U, T
- ""FORTY"": F, O, R, T, Y -> 5 distinct: F, O, R, T, Y
- ""THORN"": T, H, O, R, N -> 5 distinct: T, H, O, R, N
- ""TUMOR"": T, U, M, O, R -> 5 distinct: T, U, M, O, R

We want to cover more common consonants. The letters T, O, R are common. Then H, N, U, M, F, G, Y are less common.

Among these, ""THORN"" covers T, H, O, R, N which are all common (H and N are common). Similarly, ""GROUT"" covers G, R, O, U, T (G and U are less common than H and N?).

According to letter frequency in English words (5-letter words), the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have ruled out A, I, S, E. So the remaining common ones are R, O, T, N, L, C.

We haven't tried O, T, N, L, C.

So we should try to include O, T, N, L, C if possible.

But we must include R. So we can try to form a word with R, O, T, N, and one more.

But we have 5 letters. So we can have R, O, T, N, and say L? But is there a word ""RONT L""? Not really.

How about ""CLORT""? Not a word.

We can try ""TORCH"": T, O, R, C, H -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the third position. And tests T, O, R, C, H.

Similarly, ""NORTH"": N, O, R, T, H -> same as above but with N instead of C.

""THORN"" we already considered: T, H, O, R, N -> which is the same as NORTH but in different order? Actually, ""THORN"" is a word, and ""NORTH"" is also a word.

Both are valid.

I think ""THORN"" is a good candidate because:
  - It has R in the fourth position (which we haven't tested before, since in the first guess R was in position 1).
  - It uses common letters: T, H, O, R, N (all of which are in the top 12 most common letters in English, except H which is still common).
  - It avoids A, I, S, E.

Alternatively, ""TORCH"" is also good: T, O, R, C, H.

But we haven't tried C and H. Both are common.

Another option: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> but we haven't tried U. U is less common than O, T, N, etc.

I think ""THORN"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are trying to find the position of R. By putting R in the fourth position, we are testing that specific position. If we get a minus for R, then we know it's not in the fourth position. If we get a check, then we know it is.

Similarly, we are testing T in the first position, H in the second, O in the third, N in the fifth.

So let's go with ""THORN"".

But wait, what about the possibility that the word has two R's? We are only putting one R. But that's okay because if there is another R, we might get a minus for one of the other letters? Actually, we are only testing one R. But if the secret word has two R's, then we might not get information about the second R. However, we can handle that in subsequent guesses.

Alternatively, we could choose a word with two R's? But we don't know if there is a second R. And we don't have many words that avoid A, I, S, E and have two R's. For example, ""RURAL"" has A and is not allowed. ""PURER"" has E and is not allowed. ""MURKY"" has no R? M, U, R, K, Y -> only one R. So it's hard to find a word with two R's without the forbidden letters.

So we'll stick with one R.

Therefore, I choose ""THORN"".

But let me confirm: 
  THORN: T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

So the guess is ""thorn"".

We'll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (indicated by `-`).
- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (indicated by `x`).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R (since it's confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 1.
- The word must exclude A, I, S, and E.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with common unused letters (T, H, O, N) and placed R in a new position (position 4) to test its location.

The word ""thorn"" fits these criteria:
- Contains R in position 4.
- Uses new common letters (T, H, O, N).
- Avoids forbidden letters (A, I, S, E).

<guess>thorn</guess>",thorn,"We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the secret word but not in the first position)
  A: x (A is not in the secret word)
  I: x (I is not in the secret word)
  S: x (S is not in the secret word)
  E: x (E is not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the first position.
  - The letters A, I, S, E are not in the secret word at all.

Also, note that the secret word does not contain: A, I, S, E.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Must include the letter R (since we know it's in the word) but not in the first position.
  - Must avoid the letters A, I, S, E.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think about the position of R:
  Since in ""raise"", R was in the first position and got a minus (-), that means R is in the word but not at position 1. So R must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We can try to put R in one of these positions and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

What letters haven't we tried? We have tried R, A, I, S, E. So we should avoid those except R.

Common consonants and vowels we haven't used: 
  Vowels: O, U (and sometimes Y, but we'll avoid Y for now unless necessary)
  Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is R.

We can consider words that have R in the second, third, fourth, or fifth position.

Let's try to think of common words that fit:

Option 1: Put R in the second position. Then the word pattern: _ R _ _ _
  We need to avoid A, I, S, E. So the first letter can be one of the unused consonants or vowels (but note: first letter is often a consonant).

  Example: ""CRUST"" -> but we have to check if it avoids A, I, S, E? 
    C, R, U, S, T -> S is in the word, but we know S is not in the secret word. So we cannot use S.

  We must avoid S, so we cannot use words containing S.

  Another: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. But note: we haven't tried P, O, U, D.

  However, we also know that the secret word has R, so that's covered.

Option 2: Put R in the third position: _ _ R _ _
  Example: ""CHORD"" -> C, H, O, R, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

Option 3: Put R in the fourth position: _ _ _ R _
  Example: ""THORN"" -> T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

Option 4: Put R in the fifth position: _ _ _ _ R
  Example: ""LATER"" -> but LATER has E and R, but E is not allowed. So we need to avoid E. 
  Instead: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R -> but A is not allowed. 
  Another: ""MINOR"" -> has I and A? No, but I is not allowed. 
  So let's try: ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. Also, note that we have 5 positions to fill and we want to test common letters.

Let's list the available letters: we have 21 consonants (excluding R, S) and 2 vowels (O, U) that we haven't tried? Actually, we have more vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y. But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

We can also use Y as a vowel? For example, in words like ""DRYLY"" but that has repeated letters and we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have repeated letters. However, in this feedback, we don't have any information about repeated letters. But since we are avoiding A, I, S, E, and we know R is in the word, we don't know if R appears more than once? But we only have one R so far.

But note: the feedback for ""raise"" only showed one R and it was present (but in wrong position). If there were two R's, then the feedback would have shown two minuses or one correct and one minus? But in this case, we only have one R. So we don't know if there are multiple R's. We should consider that possibility, but for now, we assume at least one R.

We want to maximize information. So we should choose a word that has:
  - R in a position that is not the first (so positions 2,3,4,5)
  - Uses common letters that we haven't tried: for example, T, O, U, L, N, etc.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U ... but we have already ruled out A, I, S, E. So we are left with T, O, N, H, R (but R we know), D, L, U, etc.

So we should try to include T, O, N, H, D, L, U.

But we have only 5 letters. We must include R and avoid A, I, S, E.

Let me try to form a word:

Option: ""ROUTE"" -> but E is not allowed. 
Option: ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And R? We must include R! This word doesn't have R. So we cannot use it.

We must include R.

Another option: ""TROUT"" -> T, R, O, U, T -> has T repeated? That's okay. But note: we have R in the second position. And avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

But we are testing T, R, O, U. That's good.

Another: ""GROUT"" -> G, R, O, U, T -> same as above but with G instead of T at the start. But we haven't tried G.

But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible. ""TROUT"" uses T, R, O, U. We get to test T, O, U (and R we already know). But we are repeating T? Actually, two T's: so we are testing only 4 distinct letters: T, R, O, U.

Similarly, ""GROUT"" tests G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct letters? G, R, O, U, T -> yes, 5 distinct.

So ""GROUT"" might be better because it tests 5 new distinct letters (G, R, O, U, T) and we know R is included.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has G, O, U, T. But that's the point of guessing.

Another candidate: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the fourth position. And tests C, O, U, R, T.

Similarly, ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T -> but no R. So we cannot use that.

We must have R.

Another: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. Tests B, R, O, W, N.

But we haven't tried B, O, W, N.

We can also consider: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. But has M and B.

We have many options. We should choose one that covers common letters and positions.

But note: we also want to cover the position of R. Since we know R is not in position 1, we can try to put R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. We don't know which, so we might want to try a position that we haven't tested? Actually, in the first guess we tested position 1 for R and it was wrong. So we can try a different position.

But we don't have to fix the position of R in this guess? We can try any position as long as it's not position 1? Actually, we can even try position 1 again? But that would be wasteful because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 1.

Let me list some words that have R and avoid A, I, S, E, and put R in positions 2,3,4,5:

- Position 2: words like ""CRUST"" (but has S, not allowed), ""GRUNT"" (G, R, U, N, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""PRONG"" (P, R, O, N, G -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""TRUCK"" (T, R, U, C, K -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 3: ""CHARM"" (but has A, not allowed), ""BORNE"" (has E, not allowed), ""FORTY"" (F, O, R, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""HORDE"" (has E, not allowed), ""WORDY"" (W, O, R, D, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 4: ""ABHOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""ADORE"" (has A and E, not allowed), ""FJORD"" (F, J, O, R, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""THORN"" (T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 5: ""LATER"" (has E, not allowed), ""MANOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""RUMOR"" (R, U, M, O, R -> has R repeated? And we don't know if repeated letters are allowed. But the word is valid. However, we are using R twice. But we know R is in the word, so if the secret word has two R's, that's okay. But we are testing R at the end. Also, the first letter is R, which we know is not in the first position? Wait, we are putting R at the end and also at the beginning? That would be two R's. But we know the first position cannot be R, so if we put R in the first position again, that would be a waste. So we should avoid putting R in the first position.

  Instead, for position 5: ""VAPOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""TUMOR"" (T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

Now, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers multiple positions.

I think ""TROUT"" (with R in position 2) or ""FORTY"" (with R in position 3) or ""THORN"" (with R in position 4) or ""TUMOR"" (with R in position 5) are options.

But let's consider the distinct letters:

- ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, R, O, U (4 distinct, T repeated)
- ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct: G, R, O, U, T
- ""FORTY"": F, O, R, T, Y -> 5 distinct: F, O, R, T, Y
- ""THORN"": T, H, O, R, N -> 5 distinct: T, H, O, R, N
- ""TUMOR"": T, U, M, O, R -> 5 distinct: T, U, M, O, R

We want to cover more common consonants. The letters T, O, R are common. Then H, N, U, M, F, G, Y are less common.

Among these, ""THORN"" covers T, H, O, R, N which are all common (H and N are common). Similarly, ""GROUT"" covers G, R, O, U, T (G and U are less common than H and N?).

According to letter frequency in English words (5-letter words), the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have ruled out A, I, S, E. So the remaining common ones are R, O, T, N, L, C.

We haven't tried O, T, N, L, C.

So we should try to include O, T, N, L, C if possible.

But we must include R. So we can try to form a word with R, O, T, N, and one more.

But we have 5 letters. So we can have R, O, T, N, and say L? But is there a word ""RONT L""? Not really.

How about ""CLORT""? Not a word.

We can try ""TORCH"": T, O, R, C, H -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the third position. And tests T, O, R, C, H.

Similarly, ""NORTH"": N, O, R, T, H -> same as above but with N instead of C.

""THORN"" we already considered: T, H, O, R, N -> which is the same as NORTH but in different order? Actually, ""THORN"" is a word, and ""NORTH"" is also a word.

Both are valid.

I think ""THORN"" is a good candidate because:
  - It has R in the fourth position (which we haven't tested before, since in the first guess R was in position 1).
  - It uses common letters: T, H, O, R, N (all of which are in the top 12 most common letters in English, except H which is still common).
  - It avoids A, I, S, E.

Alternatively, ""TORCH"" is also good: T, O, R, C, H.

But we haven't tried C and H. Both are common.

Another option: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> but we haven't tried U. U is less common than O, T, N, etc.

I think ""THORN"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are trying to find the position of R. By putting R in the fourth position, we are testing that specific position. If we get a minus for R, then we know it's not in the fourth position. If we get a check, then we know it is.

Similarly, we are testing T in the first position, H in the second, O in the third, N in the fifth.

So let's go with ""THORN"".

But wait, what about the possibility that the word has two R's? We are only putting one R. But that's okay because if there is another R, we might get a minus for one of the other letters? Actually, we are only testing one R. But if the secret word has two R's, then we might not get information about the second R. However, we can handle that in subsequent guesses.

Alternatively, we could choose a word with two R's? But we don't know if there is a second R. And we don't have many words that avoid A, I, S, E and have two R's. For example, ""RURAL"" has A and is not allowed. ""PURER"" has E and is not allowed. ""MURKY"" has no R? M, U, R, K, Y -> only one R. So it's hard to find a word with two R's without the forbidden letters.

So we'll stick with one R.

Therefore, I choose ""THORN"".

But let me confirm: 
  THORN: T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

So the guess is ""thorn"".

We'll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (indicated by `-`).
- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (indicated by `x`).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R (since it's confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 1.
- The word must exclude A, I, S, and E.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with common unused letters (T, H, O, N) and placed R in a new position (position 4) to test its location.

The word ""thorn"" fits these criteria:
- Contains R in position 4.
- Uses new common letters (T, H, O, N).
- Avoids forbidden letters (A, I, S, E).",Guess 2: thorn -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game and need to make our first guess.
 For the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback, so we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 A common strategy is to choose a word with five distinct letters and that includes common vowels and consonants.
 Words like ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""SOARE"", ""SALET"", etc., are often used. Let's pick one that covers common letters.

 Looking at common letters in 5-letter words:
 Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)
 Consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 The word ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it has:
  - C, R, A, N, E: which are common letters and includes two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is another common starting word that has been shown to be effective.

 However, I recall that ""RAISE"" is also a popular starting word because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 Let's compare:

 Option 1: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E
 Option 2: ROAST -> R, O, A, S, T (but note that O and A are vowels, and S, T, R are common)
 Option 3: RAISE -> R, A, I, S, E (three vowels: A, I, E and consonants R, S)

 Since we are limited to the first guess and want to cover more vowels and common consonants, I think ""RAISE"" is a strong candidate.

 But note: we must make sure the word exists in the word list.

 I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it covers A, E, I (three common vowels) and R, S (common consonants).

 So, the first guess is ""RAISE"".I chose ""RAISE"" as the first guess because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing the likelihood of hitting letters in the secret word. This provides a strong foundation for narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback's ✓, -, and x indicators.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the secret word but not in the first position)
  A: x (A is not in the secret word)
  I: x (I is not in the secret word)
  S: x (S is not in the secret word)
  E: x (E is not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the first position.
  - The letters A, I, S, E are not in the secret word at all.

Also, note that the secret word does not contain: A, I, S, E.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Must include the letter R (since we know it's in the word) but not in the first position.
  - Must avoid the letters A, I, S, E.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think about the position of R:
  Since in ""raise"", R was in the first position and got a minus (-), that means R is in the word but not at position 1. So R must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We can try to put R in one of these positions and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

What letters haven't we tried? We have tried R, A, I, S, E. So we should avoid those except R.

Common consonants and vowels we haven't used: 
  Vowels: O, U (and sometimes Y, but we'll avoid Y for now unless necessary)
  Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is R.

We can consider words that have R in the second, third, fourth, or fifth position.

Let's try to think of common words that fit:

Option 1: Put R in the second position. Then the word pattern: _ R _ _ _
  We need to avoid A, I, S, E. So the first letter can be one of the unused consonants or vowels (but note: first letter is often a consonant).

  Example: ""CRUST"" -> but we have to check if it avoids A, I, S, E? 
    C, R, U, S, T -> S is in the word, but we know S is not in the secret word. So we cannot use S.

  We must avoid S, so we cannot use words containing S.

  Another: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. But note: we haven't tried P, O, U, D.

  However, we also know that the secret word has R, so that's covered.

Option 2: Put R in the third position: _ _ R _ _
  Example: ""CHORD"" -> C, H, O, R, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

Option 3: Put R in the fourth position: _ _ _ R _
  Example: ""THORN"" -> T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

Option 4: Put R in the fifth position: _ _ _ _ R
  Example: ""LATER"" -> but LATER has E and R, but E is not allowed. So we need to avoid E. 
  Instead: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R -> but A is not allowed. 
  Another: ""MINOR"" -> has I and A? No, but I is not allowed. 
  So let's try: ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. Also, note that we have 5 positions to fill and we want to test common letters.

Let's list the available letters: we have 21 consonants (excluding R, S) and 2 vowels (O, U) that we haven't tried? Actually, we have more vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y. But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

We can also use Y as a vowel? For example, in words like ""DRYLY"" but that has repeated letters and we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have repeated letters. However, in this feedback, we don't have any information about repeated letters. But since we are avoiding A, I, S, E, and we know R is in the word, we don't know if R appears more than once? But we only have one R so far.

But note: the feedback for ""raise"" only showed one R and it was present (but in wrong position). If there were two R's, then the feedback would have shown two minuses or one correct and one minus? But in this case, we only have one R. So we don't know if there are multiple R's. We should consider that possibility, but for now, we assume at least one R.

We want to maximize information. So we should choose a word that has:
  - R in a position that is not the first (so positions 2,3,4,5)
  - Uses common letters that we haven't tried: for example, T, O, U, L, N, etc.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U ... but we have already ruled out A, I, S, E. So we are left with T, O, N, H, R (but R we know), D, L, U, etc.

So we should try to include T, O, N, H, D, L, U.

But we have only 5 letters. We must include R and avoid A, I, S, E.

Let me try to form a word:

Option: ""ROUTE"" -> but E is not allowed. 
Option: ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And R? We must include R! This word doesn't have R. So we cannot use it.

We must include R.

Another option: ""TROUT"" -> T, R, O, U, T -> has T repeated? That's okay. But note: we have R in the second position. And avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

But we are testing T, R, O, U. That's good.

Another: ""GROUT"" -> G, R, O, U, T -> same as above but with G instead of T at the start. But we haven't tried G.

But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible. ""TROUT"" uses T, R, O, U. We get to test T, O, U (and R we already know). But we are repeating T? Actually, two T's: so we are testing only 4 distinct letters: T, R, O, U.

Similarly, ""GROUT"" tests G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct letters? G, R, O, U, T -> yes, 5 distinct.

So ""GROUT"" might be better because it tests 5 new distinct letters (G, R, O, U, T) and we know R is included.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has G, O, U, T. But that's the point of guessing.

Another candidate: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the fourth position. And tests C, O, U, R, T.

Similarly, ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T -> but no R. So we cannot use that.

We must have R.

Another: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. Tests B, R, O, W, N.

But we haven't tried B, O, W, N.

We can also consider: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. But has M and B.

We have many options. We should choose one that covers common letters and positions.

But note: we also want to cover the position of R. Since we know R is not in position 1, we can try to put R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. We don't know which, so we might want to try a position that we haven't tested? Actually, in the first guess we tested position 1 for R and it was wrong. So we can try a different position.

But we don't have to fix the position of R in this guess? We can try any position as long as it's not position 1? Actually, we can even try position 1 again? But that would be wasteful because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 1.

Let me list some words that have R and avoid A, I, S, E, and put R in positions 2,3,4,5:

- Position 2: words like ""CRUST"" (but has S, not allowed), ""GRUNT"" (G, R, U, N, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""PRONG"" (P, R, O, N, G -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""TRUCK"" (T, R, U, C, K -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 3: ""CHARM"" (but has A, not allowed), ""BORNE"" (has E, not allowed), ""FORTY"" (F, O, R, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""HORDE"" (has E, not allowed), ""WORDY"" (W, O, R, D, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 4: ""ABHOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""ADORE"" (has A and E, not allowed), ""FJORD"" (F, J, O, R, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""THORN"" (T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 5: ""LATER"" (has E, not allowed), ""MANOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""RUMOR"" (R, U, M, O, R -> has R repeated? And we don't know if repeated letters are allowed. But the word is valid. However, we are using R twice. But we know R is in the word, so if the secret word has two R's, that's okay. But we are testing R at the end. Also, the first letter is R, which we know is not in the first position? Wait, we are putting R at the end and also at the beginning? That would be two R's. But we know the first position cannot be R, so if we put R in the first position again, that would be a waste. So we should avoid putting R in the first position.

  Instead, for position 5: ""VAPOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""TUMOR"" (T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

Now, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers multiple positions.

I think ""TROUT"" (with R in position 2) or ""FORTY"" (with R in position 3) or ""THORN"" (with R in position 4) or ""TUMOR"" (with R in position 5) are options.

But let's consider the distinct letters:

- ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, R, O, U (4 distinct, T repeated)
- ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct: G, R, O, U, T
- ""FORTY"": F, O, R, T, Y -> 5 distinct: F, O, R, T, Y
- ""THORN"": T, H, O, R, N -> 5 distinct: T, H, O, R, N
- ""TUMOR"": T, U, M, O, R -> 5 distinct: T, U, M, O, R

We want to cover more common consonants. The letters T, O, R are common. Then H, N, U, M, F, G, Y are less common.

Among these, ""THORN"" covers T, H, O, R, N which are all common (H and N are common). Similarly, ""GROUT"" covers G, R, O, U, T (G and U are less common than H and N?).

According to letter frequency in English words (5-letter words), the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have ruled out A, I, S, E. So the remaining common ones are R, O, T, N, L, C.

We haven't tried O, T, N, L, C.

So we should try to include O, T, N, L, C if possible.

But we must include R. So we can try to form a word with R, O, T, N, and one more.

But we have 5 letters. So we can have R, O, T, N, and say L? But is there a word ""RONT L""? Not really.

How about ""CLORT""? Not a word.

We can try ""TORCH"": T, O, R, C, H -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the third position. And tests T, O, R, C, H.

Similarly, ""NORTH"": N, O, R, T, H -> same as above but with N instead of C.

""THORN"" we already considered: T, H, O, R, N -> which is the same as NORTH but in different order? Actually, ""THORN"" is a word, and ""NORTH"" is also a word.

Both are valid.

I think ""THORN"" is a good candidate because:
  - It has R in the fourth position (which we haven't tested before, since in the first guess R was in position 1).
  - It uses common letters: T, H, O, R, N (all of which are in the top 12 most common letters in English, except H which is still common).
  - It avoids A, I, S, E.

Alternatively, ""TORCH"" is also good: T, O, R, C, H.

But we haven't tried C and H. Both are common.

Another option: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> but we haven't tried U. U is less common than O, T, N, etc.

I think ""THORN"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are trying to find the position of R. By putting R in the fourth position, we are testing that specific position. If we get a minus for R, then we know it's not in the fourth position. If we get a check, then we know it is.

Similarly, we are testing T in the first position, H in the second, O in the third, N in the fifth.

So let's go with ""THORN"".

But wait, what about the possibility that the word has two R's? We are only putting one R. But that's okay because if there is another R, we might get a minus for one of the other letters? Actually, we are only testing one R. But if the secret word has two R's, then we might not get information about the second R. However, we can handle that in subsequent guesses.

Alternatively, we could choose a word with two R's? But we don't know if there is a second R. And we don't have many words that avoid A, I, S, E and have two R's. For example, ""RURAL"" has A and is not allowed. ""PURER"" has E and is not allowed. ""MURKY"" has no R? M, U, R, K, Y -> only one R. So it's hard to find a word with two R's without the forbidden letters.

So we'll stick with one R.

Therefore, I choose ""THORN"".

But let me confirm: 
  THORN: T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

So the guess is ""thorn"".

We'll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (indicated by `-`).
- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (indicated by `x`).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R (since it's confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 1.
- The word must exclude A, I, S, and E.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with common unused letters (T, H, O, N) and placed R in a new position (position 4) to test its location.

The word ""thorn"" fits these criteria:
- Contains R in position 4.
- Uses new common letters (T, H, O, N).
- Avoids forbidden letters (A, I, S, E).

Then the word pattern: _ R _ _ _\n  We need to avoid A, I, S, E. So the first letter can be one of the unused consonants or vowels (but note: first letter is often a consonant).\n\n  Example: ""CRUST"" -> but we have to check if it avoids A, I, S, E? \n    C, R, U, S, T -> S is in the word, but we know S is not in the secret word.

So we need to avoid E. \n  Instead: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R -> but A is not allowed. \n  Another: ""MINOR"" -> has I and A? No, but I is not allowed. \n  So let\'s try: ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.\n\nWe want to cover as many new letters as possible. Also, note that we have 5 positions to fill and we want to test common letters.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: we have 21 consonants (excluding R, S) and 2 vowels (O, U) that we haven\'t tried? Actually, we have more vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y. But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nWe can also use Y as a vowel? For example, in words like ""DRYLY"" but that has repeated letters and we don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically words can have repeated letters. However, in this feedback, we don\'t have any information about repeated letters. But since we are avoiding A, I, S, E, and we know R is in the word, we don\'t know if R appears more than once? But we only have one R so far.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""raise"" only showed one R and it was present (but in wrong position). If there were two R\'s, then the feedback would have shown two minuses or one correct and one minus? But in this case, we only have one R. So we don\'t know if there are multiple R\'s. We should consider that possibility, but for now, we assume at least one R.\n\nWe want to maximize information. So we should choose a word that has:\n  - R in a position that is not the first (so positions 2,3,4,5)\n  - Uses common letters that we haven\'t tried: for example, T, O, U, L, N, etc.\n\nCommon letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U ... but we have already ruled out A, I, S, E. So we are left with T, O, N, H, R (but R we know), D, L, U, etc.\n\nSo we should try to include T, O, N, H, D, L, U.\n\nBut we have only 5 letters. We must include R and avoid A, I, S, E.\n\nLet me try to form a word:\n\nOption: ""ROUTE"" -> but E is not allowed. \nOption: ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And R? We must include R! This word doesn\'t have R. So we cannot use it.\n\nWe must include R.\n\nAnother option: ""TROUT"" -> T, R, O, U, T -> has T repeated? That\'s okay. But note: we have R in the second position. And avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.\n\nBut we are testing T, R, O, U. That\'s good.\n\nAnother: ""GROUT"" -> G, R, O, U, T -> same as above but with G instead of T at the start. But we haven\'t tried G.\n\nBut note: we want to test as many new letters as possible. ""TROUT"" uses T, R, O, U. We get to test T, O, U (and R we already know). But we are repeating T? Actually, two T\'s: so we are testing only 4 distinct letters: T, R, O, U.\n\nSimilarly, ""GROUT"" tests G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct letters? G, R, O, U, T -> yes, 5 distinct.\n\nSo ""GROUT"" might be better because it tests 5 new distinct letters (G, R, O, U, T) and we know R is included.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the secret word has G, O, U, T. But that\'s the point of guessing.\n\nAnother candidate: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the fourth position. And tests C, O, U, R, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T -> but no R. So we cannot use that.\n\nWe must have R.\n\nAnother: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. Tests B, R, O, W, N.\n\nBut we haven\'t tried B, O, W, N.\n\nWe can also consider: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. But has M and B.\n\nWe have many options. We should choose one that covers common letters and positions.\n\nBut note: we also want to cover the position of R. Since we know R is not in position 1, we can try to put R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. We don\'t know which, so we might want to try a position that we haven\'t tested? Actually, in the first guess we tested position 1 for R and it was wrong. So we can try a different position.\n\nBut we don\'t have to fix the position of R in this guess? We can try any position as long as it\'s not position 1? Actually, we can even try position 1 again? But that would be wasteful because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 1.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and avoid A, I, S, E, and put R in positions 2,3,4,5:\n\n- Position 2: words like ""CRUST"" (but has S, not allowed), ""GRUNT"" (G, R, U, N, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""PRONG"" (P, R, O, N, G -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""TRUCK"" (T, R, U, C, K -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).\n\n- Position 3: ""CHARM"" (but has A, not allowed), ""BORNE"" (has E, not allowed), ""FORTY"" (F, O, R, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""HORDE"" (has E, not allowed), ""WORDY"" (W, O, R, D, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).\n\n- Position 4: ""ABHOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""ADORE"" (has A and E, not allowed), ""FJORD"" (F, J, O, R, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""THORN"" (T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).\n\n- Position 5: ""LATER"" (has E, not allowed), ""MANOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""RUMOR"" (R, U, M, O, R -> has R repeated? And we don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed. But the word is valid. However, we are using R twice. But we know R is in the word, so if the secret word has two R\'s, that\'s okay. But we are testing R at the end. Also, the first letter is R, which we know is not in the first position? Wait, we are putting R at the end and also at the beginning? That would be two R\'s. But we know the first position cannot be R, so if we put R in the first position again, that would be a waste. So we should avoid putting R in the first position.\n\n  Instead, for position 5: ""VAPOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""TUMOR"" (T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).\n\nNow, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers multiple positions.\n\nI think ""TROUT"" (with R in position 2) or ""FORTY"" (with R in position 3) or ""THORN"" (with R in position 4) or ""TUMOR"" (with R in position 5) are options.\n\nBut let\'s consider the distinct letters:\n\n- ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, R, O, U (4 distinct, T repeated)\n- ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct: G, R, O, U, T\n- ""FORTY"": F, O, R, T, Y -> 5 distinct: F, O, R, T, Y\n- ""THORN"": T, H, O, R, N -> 5 distinct: T, H, O, R, N\n- ""TUMOR"": T, U, M, O, R -> 5 distinct: T, U, M, O, R\n\nWe want to cover more common consonants. The letters T, O, R are common. Then H, N, U, M, F, G, Y are less common.\n\nAmong these, ""THORN"" covers T, H, O, R, N which are all common (H and N are common). Similarly, ""GROUT"" covers G, R, O, U, T (G and U are less common than H and N?).\n\nAccording to letter frequency in English words (5-letter words), the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have ruled out A, I, S, E. So the remaining common ones are R, O, T, N, L, C.\n\nWe haven\'t tried O, T, N, L, C.\n\nSo we should try to include O, T, N, L, C if possible.\n\nBut we must include R. So we can try to form a word with R, O, T, N, and one more.\n\nBut we have 5 letters. So we can have R, O, T, N, and say L? But is there a word ""RONT L""? Not really.\n\nHow about ""CLORT""? Not a word.\n\nWe can try ""TORCH"": T, O, R, C, H -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the third position. And tests T, O, R, C, H.\n\nSimilarly, ""NORTH"": N, O, R, T, H -> same as above but with N instead of C.\n\n""THORN"" we already considered: T, H, O, R, N -> which is the same as NORTH but in different order? Actually, ""THORN"" is a word, and ""NORTH"" is also a word.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI think ""THORN"" is a good candidate because:\n  - It has R in the fourth position (which we haven\'t tested before, since in the first guess R was in position 1).\n  - It uses common letters: T, H, O, R, N (all of which are in the top 12 most common letters in English, except H which is still common).\n  - It avoids A, I, S, E.\n\nAlternatively, ""TORCH"" is also good: T, O, R, C, H.\n\nBut we haven\'t tried C and H. Both are common.\n\nAnother option: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> but we haven\'t tried U. U is less common than O, T, N, etc.\n\nI think ""THORN"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we are trying to find the position of R. By putting R in the fourth position, we are testing that specific position. If we get a minus for R, then we know it\'s not in the fourth position. If we get a check, then we know it is.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing T in the first position, H in the second, O in the third, N in the fifth.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""THORN"".\n\nBut wait, what about the possibility that the word has two R\'s? We are only putting one R. But that\'s okay because if there is another R, we might get a minus for one of the other letters? Actually, we are only testing one R.

""MURKY"" has no R? M, U, R, K, Y -> only one R. So it\'s hard to find a word with two R\'s without the forbidden letters.\n\nSo we\'ll stick with one R.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""THORN"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  THORN: T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.\n\nSo the guess is ""thorn"".\n\nWe\'ll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (indicated by `-`).\n- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (indicated by `x`).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include R (since it\'s confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 1.\n- The word must exclude A, I, S, and E.\n- To maximize information, I chose a word with common unused letters (T, H, O, N) and placed R in a new position (position 4) to test its location.\n\nThe word ""thorn"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains R in position 4.\n- Uses new common letters (T, H, O, N).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (A, I, S, E).\n\n<guess>thorn</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: thorn -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A, I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""thorn"" -> T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
Meaning:
- T, H, O, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in this guess and got a minus).

We also know from Guess 1 that R is not in position 1.

So now we know:
- R is present in the word, but not in positions 1 or 4.
- Therefore, R must be in position 2, 3, or 5 of the secret word.

Additionally, the following letters are not in the word: A, I, S, E, T, H, O, N.

We have eliminated 9 letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N. (Note: R is confirmed present.)

Now, we need to come up with a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R (exactly, but possibly more, though we don't know) in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5.
- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.
- Includes new common letters to test.

Available letters: The English alphabet minus the eliminated ones.
Eliminated: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.
So remaining: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and R (which we must use).

We note that R is in the word, so our guess must include R in position 2, 3, or 5.

To maximize information, we should:
1. Pick a word with R in one of the untested positions: 2, 3, or 5 (since position 1 and 4 are ruled out).
2. Use common remaining letters to cover more possibilities.

Common letters from the remaining set: L, U, D, M, P, C, etc.

We can try to form words:

Option: Put R in position 2: _ R _ _ _
We need to fill with 4 letters from the remaining set, avoiding the eliminated ones.

Example: ""URBAN"" -> but U, R, B, A, N -> A and N are eliminated. Not allowed.
Another: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids eliminated letters? 
- Check: C (ok), R (must), U (ok), M (ok), B (ok). 
But note: we haven't tried these letters. However, the word ""crumb"" is a valid English word.

But also: ""CRUMB"" has R in position 2? Let's see:
Position 1: C
Position 2: R
Position 3: U
Position 4: M
Position 5: B

Yes.

Option: Put R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
Example: ""LUMPY"" -> but no R. Need R.
""CLAMP"" -> C, L, A, M, P -> A is eliminated.
""PLUMB"" -> P, L, U, M, B -> no R.
We need a word with R in position 3: _ _ R _ _

Example: ""BERRY"" -> B, E, R, R, Y -> E is eliminated.
""FERRY"" -> F, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated.
""PURGE"" -> P, U, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

So hard to find words without the eliminated vowels. 

Another: ""MYRRH"" -> M, Y, R, R, H -> H is eliminated (from the feedback of thorn: H was x).
H is out.

""BARMY"" -> B, A, R, M, Y -> A eliminated.

Try: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> 
Positions: 1:M, 2:U, 3:R, 4:K, 5:Y
Eliminated letters: avoids A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N? Yes. So it's valid.

But note: does it have R? Yes, in position 3.

Option: Put R in position 5: _ _ _ _ R
Example: ""LUCRE"" -> L, U, C, R, E -> E eliminated.
""VAPOR"" -> V, A, P, O, R -> A and O eliminated.
""RUMOR"" -> R, U, M, O, R -> O eliminated? And R in position 1 and 5? But position 1 is already known to be not R, so position 1 must be a different letter. However, ""rumor"" starts with R, which is not allowed. So we avoid words starting with R.

Another: ""HUMOR"" -> H, U, M, O, R -> H and O eliminated.
""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> T and O eliminated.

So position 5 is tricky because many words end with R and use common vowels that are eliminated.

Therefore, possible words we have so far:
- With R in position 2: ""CRUMB"", or possibly others.
- With R in position 3: ""MURKY""

We need to consider more words.

Another R in position 5: ""JUICY"" -> J, U, I, C, Y -> I eliminated.
But we need R: ""GUPPY"" -> No R.
""PUPPY"" -> No R.
""LYMPh"" -> Not allowed and has H which is eliminated.

Let me think of words ending with R and without the eliminated vowels: 
Words ending in R: using remaining vowels: U, and consonants.

Example: ""SUGAR"" -> S, U, G, A, R -> S and A eliminated.
""VAPOR"" -> eliminated.
""RADAR"" -> but starts with R and has A and R - multiple issues.

With U: ""ULCUR"" -> not a word.
With U: ""SUPER"" -> S eliminated and E.

Actually, it's hard. Maybe try ""AUDIO"" but doesn't end with R and has A.

Focus on R in position 2 or 3.

We have ""CRUMB"" (R in position 2) and ""MURKY"" (R in position 3).

""CRUMB"": letters C, R, U, M, B
""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y

Both avoid eliminated letters.

We want to choose one that tests more common letters? The remaining common letters: among the available set, common consonants: L, C, D, M, P, U, F, etc.

But note: U is a vowel and we haven't tested it, so it might be present.

Also, we need to consider that there might be two R's? But we don't know, so we should focus on single R for now.

Two candidates: 
- ""CRUMB""
- ""MURKY""

Which one gives more information? 
""CRUMB"" has C, U, M, B and R (which we know). 
""MURKY"" has M, U, R, K, Y.

Both test U and M (common). ""CRUMB"" tests C and B; ""MURKY"" tests K and Y.

C is more common than K or Y, so ""CRUMB"" might be slightly better.

But we don't know. Another word: ""CURVY""? C, U, R, V, Y -> R is in position 3? 
C in position 1, U in 2, R in 3, V in 4, Y in 5. 
Avoids eliminated letters? Yes.

So we have three options:
- ""CRUMB"" (R in 2nd): C, R, U, M, B
- ""CURVY"" (R in 3rd): C, U, R, V, Y
- ""MURKY"" (R in 3rd): M, U, R, K, Y

Another possibility: ""DRAFT"" -> D, R, A, F, T -> A and T eliminated.
Not good.

""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W?, L -> O eliminated? O is eliminated.

We must avoid O so any word containing O is invalid.

Now, ""CRUMB"", ""CURVY"", ""MURKY"". 

But ""CURVY"" uses V and Y, which are less common. ""CRUMB"" uses M and B. 

Alternatively, ""RUGBY""? R, U, G, B, Y -> 
Positions: 1:R -> but we know R cannot be in position 1! So if we start a word with R, it's invalid for position.

""RUGBY"" has R in position 1 -> not allowed. So must avoid.

Therefore, we must not put R in position 1.

Now, among the above, I think ""CRUMB"" is valid and tests more common consonants.

But let's consider ""CURLY"": C, U, R, L, Y -> R in position 3? 
C, U, R, L, Y: positions 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:L, 5:Y. 
Avoids eliminated? Yes.

So another candidate: ""CURLY"": tests C, U, R, L, Y.

L is a common consonant. 

Similarly, ""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> but we can put B at position 1 and R at position 3.

We have several options.

We need to pick one. Let's list:

1. ""CRUMB"" - R in position 2: C, R, U, M, B -> letters: C, R, U, M, B
2. ""CURLY"" - R in position 3: C, U, R, L, Y -> letters: C, U, R, L, Y
3. ""MURKY"" - R in position 3: M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M, U, R, K, Y
4. ""CURVY"" - R in position 3: C, U, R, V, Y -> letters: C, U, R, V, Y

We should avoid starting with R or having R in position 4? We know R cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

To test the position of R, we might pick one choice. For example, if we pick R in position 2, we can rule it out if wrong.

I think ""CURLY"" is a good choice because L is a common letter and we haven't tested it. Also, Y is sometimes a vowel.

But we also have to think: we have eliminated vowels A, E, I, O. So the word must have vowels: U, or Y (as in sky), or possibly other? But the secret word must have at least one vowel.

The remaining vowels are U, and sometimes Y (but Y can be consonant too). So we need to test U and/or Y.

Most words will need a vowel, so U is a good candidate.

Therefore, ""CURLY"" covers U and Y.

Also, common consonants C and L.

So I'll go with ""CURLY"".

But to decide between positions: R in position 3. We haven't tested position 3 before? 
- In guess 1, R was in position 1.
- In guess 2, R was in position 4.
- Now we are testing position 3.

So we are systematically checking positions.

If R is not in position 3, then it must be position 2 or 5? Position 5 we haven't tried.

But we can do that later.

So guess: ""curly"".

But note: we are also testing if L and Y are in the word.

Therefore, I choose ""curly"".

But let me double-check: 
- Secret word has R, not in pos 1 or 4.
- We don't know if it has U, L, Y, C.
- Avoided all eliminated letters.

Yes.

So response: <guess>curly</guess>
</think>
From the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""raise""**: R is present but not in position 1; A, I, S, E are absent.
- **Guess 2: ""thorn""**: R is present but not in position 4; T, H, O, N are absent.

**Key Insights:**
- R must be in the secret word but **not in positions 1 or 4**, so it can only be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Eliminated letters (absences): A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.
- Remaining available letters (besides R): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

**Strategy for Guess 3:**
- Include R in position 2, 3, or 5 to test its correct placement.
- Use common letters from the remaining pool to maximize information, avoiding eliminated letters.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters like L, U, C, and Y (as pseudovowel).
- Avoid positions tested for R before (position 1 and 4 are ruled out).

**Selection:**
Chose ""**curly**"" because:
- R is in position 3 (untested position).
- Includes new common letters: C, U (vowel), L, Y (vowel substitute).
- Avoids all eliminated letters (A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N).
- Tests U and Y, crucial given the absence of other vowels.
- Provides broad coverage: if U or Y appears, it narrows vowel options; if not, more consonants are ruled out.

<guess>curly</guess>",curly,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A, I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""thorn"" -> T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
Meaning:
- T, H, O, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in this guess and got a minus).

We also know from Guess 1 that R is not in position 1.

So now we know:
- R is present in the word, but not in positions 1 or 4.
- Therefore, R must be in position 2, 3, or 5 of the secret word.

Additionally, the following letters are not in the word: A, I, S, E, T, H, O, N.

We have eliminated 9 letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N. (Note: R is confirmed present.)

Now, we need to come up with a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R (exactly, but possibly more, though we don't know) in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5.
- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.
- Includes new common letters to test.

Available letters: The English alphabet minus the eliminated ones.
Eliminated: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.
So remaining: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and R (which we must use).

We note that R is in the word, so our guess must include R in position 2, 3, or 5.

To maximize information, we should:
1. Pick a word with R in one of the untested positions: 2, 3, or 5 (since position 1 and 4 are ruled out).
2. Use common remaining letters to cover more possibilities.

Common letters from the remaining set: L, U, D, M, P, C, etc.

We can try to form words:

Option: Put R in position 2: _ R _ _ _
We need to fill with 4 letters from the remaining set, avoiding the eliminated ones.

Example: ""URBAN"" -> but U, R, B, A, N -> A and N are eliminated. Not allowed.
Another: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids eliminated letters? 
- Check: C (ok), R (must), U (ok), M (ok), B (ok). 
But note: we haven't tried these letters. However, the word ""crumb"" is a valid English word.

But also: ""CRUMB"" has R in position 2? Let's see:
Position 1: C
Position 2: R
Position 3: U
Position 4: M
Position 5: B

Yes.

Option: Put R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
Example: ""LUMPY"" -> but no R. Need R.
""CLAMP"" -> C, L, A, M, P -> A is eliminated.
""PLUMB"" -> P, L, U, M, B -> no R.
We need a word with R in position 3: _ _ R _ _

Example: ""BERRY"" -> B, E, R, R, Y -> E is eliminated.
""FERRY"" -> F, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated.
""PURGE"" -> P, U, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

So hard to find words without the eliminated vowels. 

Another: ""MYRRH"" -> M, Y, R, R, H -> H is eliminated (from the feedback of thorn: H was x).
H is out.

""BARMY"" -> B, A, R, M, Y -> A eliminated.

Try: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> 
Positions: 1:M, 2:U, 3:R, 4:K, 5:Y
Eliminated letters: avoids A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N? Yes. So it's valid.

But note: does it have R? Yes, in position 3.

Option: Put R in position 5: _ _ _ _ R
Example: ""LUCRE"" -> L, U, C, R, E -> E eliminated.
""VAPOR"" -> V, A, P, O, R -> A and O eliminated.
""RUMOR"" -> R, U, M, O, R -> O eliminated? And R in position 1 and 5? But position 1 is already known to be not R, so position 1 must be a different letter. However, ""rumor"" starts with R, which is not allowed. So we avoid words starting with R.

Another: ""HUMOR"" -> H, U, M, O, R -> H and O eliminated.
""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> T and O eliminated.

So position 5 is tricky because many words end with R and use common vowels that are eliminated.

Therefore, possible words we have so far:
- With R in position 2: ""CRUMB"", or possibly others.
- With R in position 3: ""MURKY""

We need to consider more words.

Another R in position 5: ""JUICY"" -> J, U, I, C, Y -> I eliminated.
But we need R: ""GUPPY"" -> No R.
""PUPPY"" -> No R.
""LYMPh"" -> Not allowed and has H which is eliminated.

Let me think of words ending with R and without the eliminated vowels: 
Words ending in R: using remaining vowels: U, and consonants.

Example: ""SUGAR"" -> S, U, G, A, R -> S and A eliminated.
""VAPOR"" -> eliminated.
""RADAR"" -> but starts with R and has A and R - multiple issues.

With U: ""ULCUR"" -> not a word.
With U: ""SUPER"" -> S eliminated and E.

Actually, it's hard. Maybe try ""AUDIO"" but doesn't end with R and has A.

Focus on R in position 2 or 3.

We have ""CRUMB"" (R in position 2) and ""MURKY"" (R in position 3).

""CRUMB"": letters C, R, U, M, B
""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y

Both avoid eliminated letters.

We want to choose one that tests more common letters? The remaining common letters: among the available set, common consonants: L, C, D, M, P, U, F, etc.

But note: U is a vowel and we haven't tested it, so it might be present.

Also, we need to consider that there might be two R's? But we don't know, so we should focus on single R for now.

Two candidates: 
- ""CRUMB""
- ""MURKY""

Which one gives more information? 
""CRUMB"" has C, U, M, B and R (which we know). 
""MURKY"" has M, U, R, K, Y.

Both test U and M (common). ""CRUMB"" tests C and B; ""MURKY"" tests K and Y.

C is more common than K or Y, so ""CRUMB"" might be slightly better.

But we don't know. Another word: ""CURVY""? C, U, R, V, Y -> R is in position 3? 
C in position 1, U in 2, R in 3, V in 4, Y in 5. 
Avoids eliminated letters? Yes.

So we have three options:
- ""CRUMB"" (R in 2nd): C, R, U, M, B
- ""CURVY"" (R in 3rd): C, U, R, V, Y
- ""MURKY"" (R in 3rd): M, U, R, K, Y

Another possibility: ""DRAFT"" -> D, R, A, F, T -> A and T eliminated.
Not good.

""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W?, L -> O eliminated? O is eliminated.

We must avoid O so any word containing O is invalid.

Now, ""CRUMB"", ""CURVY"", ""MURKY"". 

But ""CURVY"" uses V and Y, which are less common. ""CRUMB"" uses M and B. 

Alternatively, ""RUGBY""? R, U, G, B, Y -> 
Positions: 1:R -> but we know R cannot be in position 1! So if we start a word with R, it's invalid for position.

""RUGBY"" has R in position 1 -> not allowed. So must avoid.

Therefore, we must not put R in position 1.

Now, among the above, I think ""CRUMB"" is valid and tests more common consonants.

But let's consider ""CURLY"": C, U, R, L, Y -> R in position 3? 
C, U, R, L, Y: positions 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:L, 5:Y. 
Avoids eliminated? Yes.

So another candidate: ""CURLY"": tests C, U, R, L, Y.

L is a common consonant. 

Similarly, ""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> but we can put B at position 1 and R at position 3.

We have several options.

We need to pick one. Let's list:

1. ""CRUMB"" - R in position 2: C, R, U, M, B -> letters: C, R, U, M, B
2. ""CURLY"" - R in position 3: C, U, R, L, Y -> letters: C, U, R, L, Y
3. ""MURKY"" - R in position 3: M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M, U, R, K, Y
4. ""CURVY"" - R in position 3: C, U, R, V, Y -> letters: C, U, R, V, Y

We should avoid starting with R or having R in position 4? We know R cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

To test the position of R, we might pick one choice. For example, if we pick R in position 2, we can rule it out if wrong.

I think ""CURLY"" is a good choice because L is a common letter and we haven't tested it. Also, Y is sometimes a vowel.

But we also have to think: we have eliminated vowels A, E, I, O. So the word must have vowels: U, or Y (as in sky), or possibly other? But the secret word must have at least one vowel.

The remaining vowels are U, and sometimes Y (but Y can be consonant too). So we need to test U and/or Y.

Most words will need a vowel, so U is a good candidate.

Therefore, ""CURLY"" covers U and Y.

Also, common consonants C and L.

So I'll go with ""CURLY"".

But to decide between positions: R in position 3. We haven't tested position 3 before? 
- In guess 1, R was in position 1.
- In guess 2, R was in position 4.
- Now we are testing position 3.

So we are systematically checking positions.

If R is not in position 3, then it must be position 2 or 5? Position 5 we haven't tried.

But we can do that later.

So guess: ""curly"".

But note: we are also testing if L and Y are in the word.

Therefore, I choose ""curly"".

But let me double-check: 
- Secret word has R, not in pos 1 or 4.
- We don't know if it has U, L, Y, C.
- Avoided all eliminated letters.

Yes.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game and need to make our first guess.
 For the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback, so we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 A common strategy is to choose a word with five distinct letters and that includes common vowels and consonants.
 Words like ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""SOARE"", ""SALET"", etc., are often used. Let's pick one that covers common letters.

 Looking at common letters in 5-letter words:
 Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)
 Consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 The word ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it has:
  - C, R, A, N, E: which are common letters and includes two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is another common starting word that has been shown to be effective.

 However, I recall that ""RAISE"" is also a popular starting word because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 Let's compare:

 Option 1: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E
 Option 2: ROAST -> R, O, A, S, T (but note that O and A are vowels, and S, T, R are common)
 Option 3: RAISE -> R, A, I, S, E (three vowels: A, I, E and consonants R, S)

 Since we are limited to the first guess and want to cover more vowels and common consonants, I think ""RAISE"" is a strong candidate.

 But note: we must make sure the word exists in the word list.

 I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it covers A, E, I (three common vowels) and R, S (common consonants).

 So, the first guess is ""RAISE"".I chose ""RAISE"" as the first guess because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing the likelihood of hitting letters in the secret word. This provides a strong foundation for narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback's ✓, -, and x indicators.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the secret word but not in the first position)
  A: x (A is not in the secret word)
  I: x (I is not in the secret word)
  S: x (S is not in the secret word)
  E: x (E is not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the first position.
  - The letters A, I, S, E are not in the secret word at all.

Also, note that the secret word does not contain: A, I, S, E.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Must include the letter R (since we know it's in the word) but not in the first position.
  - Must avoid the letters A, I, S, E.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think about the position of R:
  Since in ""raise"", R was in the first position and got a minus (-), that means R is in the word but not at position 1. So R must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We can try to put R in one of these positions and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

What letters haven't we tried? We have tried R, A, I, S, E. So we should avoid those except R.

Common consonants and vowels we haven't used: 
  Vowels: O, U (and sometimes Y, but we'll avoid Y for now unless necessary)
  Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is R.

We can consider words that have R in the second, third, fourth, or fifth position.

Let's try to think of common words that fit:

Option 1: Put R in the second position. Then the word pattern: _ R _ _ _
  We need to avoid A, I, S, E. So the first letter can be one of the unused consonants or vowels (but note: first letter is often a consonant).

  Example: ""CRUST"" -> but we have to check if it avoids A, I, S, E? 
    C, R, U, S, T -> S is in the word, but we know S is not in the secret word. So we cannot use S.

  We must avoid S, so we cannot use words containing S.

  Another: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. But note: we haven't tried P, O, U, D.

  However, we also know that the secret word has R, so that's covered.

Option 2: Put R in the third position: _ _ R _ _
  Example: ""CHORD"" -> C, H, O, R, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

Option 3: Put R in the fourth position: _ _ _ R _
  Example: ""THORN"" -> T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

Option 4: Put R in the fifth position: _ _ _ _ R
  Example: ""LATER"" -> but LATER has E and R, but E is not allowed. So we need to avoid E. 
  Instead: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R -> but A is not allowed. 
  Another: ""MINOR"" -> has I and A? No, but I is not allowed. 
  So let's try: ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. Also, note that we have 5 positions to fill and we want to test common letters.

Let's list the available letters: we have 21 consonants (excluding R, S) and 2 vowels (O, U) that we haven't tried? Actually, we have more vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y. But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

We can also use Y as a vowel? For example, in words like ""DRYLY"" but that has repeated letters and we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have repeated letters. However, in this feedback, we don't have any information about repeated letters. But since we are avoiding A, I, S, E, and we know R is in the word, we don't know if R appears more than once? But we only have one R so far.

But note: the feedback for ""raise"" only showed one R and it was present (but in wrong position). If there were two R's, then the feedback would have shown two minuses or one correct and one minus? But in this case, we only have one R. So we don't know if there are multiple R's. We should consider that possibility, but for now, we assume at least one R.

We want to maximize information. So we should choose a word that has:
  - R in a position that is not the first (so positions 2,3,4,5)
  - Uses common letters that we haven't tried: for example, T, O, U, L, N, etc.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U ... but we have already ruled out A, I, S, E. So we are left with T, O, N, H, R (but R we know), D, L, U, etc.

So we should try to include T, O, N, H, D, L, U.

But we have only 5 letters. We must include R and avoid A, I, S, E.

Let me try to form a word:

Option: ""ROUTE"" -> but E is not allowed. 
Option: ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And R? We must include R! This word doesn't have R. So we cannot use it.

We must include R.

Another option: ""TROUT"" -> T, R, O, U, T -> has T repeated? That's okay. But note: we have R in the second position. And avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

But we are testing T, R, O, U. That's good.

Another: ""GROUT"" -> G, R, O, U, T -> same as above but with G instead of T at the start. But we haven't tried G.

But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible. ""TROUT"" uses T, R, O, U. We get to test T, O, U (and R we already know). But we are repeating T? Actually, two T's: so we are testing only 4 distinct letters: T, R, O, U.

Similarly, ""GROUT"" tests G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct letters? G, R, O, U, T -> yes, 5 distinct.

So ""GROUT"" might be better because it tests 5 new distinct letters (G, R, O, U, T) and we know R is included.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has G, O, U, T. But that's the point of guessing.

Another candidate: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the fourth position. And tests C, O, U, R, T.

Similarly, ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T -> but no R. So we cannot use that.

We must have R.

Another: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. Tests B, R, O, W, N.

But we haven't tried B, O, W, N.

We can also consider: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. But has M and B.

We have many options. We should choose one that covers common letters and positions.

But note: we also want to cover the position of R. Since we know R is not in position 1, we can try to put R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. We don't know which, so we might want to try a position that we haven't tested? Actually, in the first guess we tested position 1 for R and it was wrong. So we can try a different position.

But we don't have to fix the position of R in this guess? We can try any position as long as it's not position 1? Actually, we can even try position 1 again? But that would be wasteful because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 1.

Let me list some words that have R and avoid A, I, S, E, and put R in positions 2,3,4,5:

- Position 2: words like ""CRUST"" (but has S, not allowed), ""GRUNT"" (G, R, U, N, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""PRONG"" (P, R, O, N, G -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""TRUCK"" (T, R, U, C, K -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 3: ""CHARM"" (but has A, not allowed), ""BORNE"" (has E, not allowed), ""FORTY"" (F, O, R, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""HORDE"" (has E, not allowed), ""WORDY"" (W, O, R, D, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 4: ""ABHOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""ADORE"" (has A and E, not allowed), ""FJORD"" (F, J, O, R, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""THORN"" (T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 5: ""LATER"" (has E, not allowed), ""MANOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""RUMOR"" (R, U, M, O, R -> has R repeated? And we don't know if repeated letters are allowed. But the word is valid. However, we are using R twice. But we know R is in the word, so if the secret word has two R's, that's okay. But we are testing R at the end. Also, the first letter is R, which we know is not in the first position? Wait, we are putting R at the end and also at the beginning? That would be two R's. But we know the first position cannot be R, so if we put R in the first position again, that would be a waste. So we should avoid putting R in the first position.

  Instead, for position 5: ""VAPOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""TUMOR"" (T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

Now, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers multiple positions.

I think ""TROUT"" (with R in position 2) or ""FORTY"" (with R in position 3) or ""THORN"" (with R in position 4) or ""TUMOR"" (with R in position 5) are options.

But let's consider the distinct letters:

- ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, R, O, U (4 distinct, T repeated)
- ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct: G, R, O, U, T
- ""FORTY"": F, O, R, T, Y -> 5 distinct: F, O, R, T, Y
- ""THORN"": T, H, O, R, N -> 5 distinct: T, H, O, R, N
- ""TUMOR"": T, U, M, O, R -> 5 distinct: T, U, M, O, R

We want to cover more common consonants. The letters T, O, R are common. Then H, N, U, M, F, G, Y are less common.

Among these, ""THORN"" covers T, H, O, R, N which are all common (H and N are common). Similarly, ""GROUT"" covers G, R, O, U, T (G and U are less common than H and N?).

According to letter frequency in English words (5-letter words), the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have ruled out A, I, S, E. So the remaining common ones are R, O, T, N, L, C.

We haven't tried O, T, N, L, C.

So we should try to include O, T, N, L, C if possible.

But we must include R. So we can try to form a word with R, O, T, N, and one more.

But we have 5 letters. So we can have R, O, T, N, and say L? But is there a word ""RONT L""? Not really.

How about ""CLORT""? Not a word.

We can try ""TORCH"": T, O, R, C, H -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the third position. And tests T, O, R, C, H.

Similarly, ""NORTH"": N, O, R, T, H -> same as above but with N instead of C.

""THORN"" we already considered: T, H, O, R, N -> which is the same as NORTH but in different order? Actually, ""THORN"" is a word, and ""NORTH"" is also a word.

Both are valid.

I think ""THORN"" is a good candidate because:
  - It has R in the fourth position (which we haven't tested before, since in the first guess R was in position 1).
  - It uses common letters: T, H, O, R, N (all of which are in the top 12 most common letters in English, except H which is still common).
  - It avoids A, I, S, E.

Alternatively, ""TORCH"" is also good: T, O, R, C, H.

But we haven't tried C and H. Both are common.

Another option: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> but we haven't tried U. U is less common than O, T, N, etc.

I think ""THORN"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are trying to find the position of R. By putting R in the fourth position, we are testing that specific position. If we get a minus for R, then we know it's not in the fourth position. If we get a check, then we know it is.

Similarly, we are testing T in the first position, H in the second, O in the third, N in the fifth.

So let's go with ""THORN"".

But wait, what about the possibility that the word has two R's? We are only putting one R. But that's okay because if there is another R, we might get a minus for one of the other letters? Actually, we are only testing one R. But if the secret word has two R's, then we might not get information about the second R. However, we can handle that in subsequent guesses.

Alternatively, we could choose a word with two R's? But we don't know if there is a second R. And we don't have many words that avoid A, I, S, E and have two R's. For example, ""RURAL"" has A and is not allowed. ""PURER"" has E and is not allowed. ""MURKY"" has no R? M, U, R, K, Y -> only one R. So it's hard to find a word with two R's without the forbidden letters.

So we'll stick with one R.

Therefore, I choose ""THORN"".

But let me confirm: 
  THORN: T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

So the guess is ""thorn"".

We'll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (indicated by `-`).
- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (indicated by `x`).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R (since it's confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 1.
- The word must exclude A, I, S, and E.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with common unused letters (T, H, O, N) and placed R in a new position (position 4) to test its location.

The word ""thorn"" fits these criteria:
- Contains R in position 4.
- Uses new common letters (T, H, O, N).
- Avoids forbidden letters (A, I, S, E).

<guess>thorn</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: thorn -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A, I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""thorn"" -> T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
Meaning:
- T, H, O, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in this guess and got a minus).

We also know from Guess 1 that R is not in position 1.

So now we know:
- R is present in the word, but not in positions 1 or 4.
- Therefore, R must be in position 2, 3, or 5 of the secret word.

Additionally, the following letters are not in the word: A, I, S, E, T, H, O, N.

We have eliminated 9 letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N. (Note: R is confirmed present.)

Now, we need to come up with a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R (exactly, but possibly more, though we don't know) in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5.
- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.
- Includes new common letters to test.

Available letters: The English alphabet minus the eliminated ones.
Eliminated: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.
So remaining: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and R (which we must use).

We note that R is in the word, so our guess must include R in position 2, 3, or 5.

To maximize information, we should:
1. Pick a word with R in one of the untested positions: 2, 3, or 5 (since position 1 and 4 are ruled out).
2. Use common remaining letters to cover more possibilities.

Common letters from the remaining set: L, U, D, M, P, C, etc.

We can try to form words:

Option: Put R in position 2: _ R _ _ _
We need to fill with 4 letters from the remaining set, avoiding the eliminated ones.

Example: ""URBAN"" -> but U, R, B, A, N -> A and N are eliminated. Not allowed.
Another: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids eliminated letters? 
- Check: C (ok), R (must), U (ok), M (ok), B (ok). 
But note: we haven't tried these letters. However, the word ""crumb"" is a valid English word.

But also: ""CRUMB"" has R in position 2? Let's see:
Position 1: C
Position 2: R
Position 3: U
Position 4: M
Position 5: B

Yes.

Option: Put R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
Example: ""LUMPY"" -> but no R. Need R.
""CLAMP"" -> C, L, A, M, P -> A is eliminated.
""PLUMB"" -> P, L, U, M, B -> no R.
We need a word with R in position 3: _ _ R _ _

Example: ""BERRY"" -> B, E, R, R, Y -> E is eliminated.
""FERRY"" -> F, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated.
""PURGE"" -> P, U, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

So hard to find words without the eliminated vowels. 

Another: ""MYRRH"" -> M, Y, R, R, H -> H is eliminated (from the feedback of thorn: H was x).
H is out.

""BARMY"" -> B, A, R, M, Y -> A eliminated.

Try: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> 
Positions: 1:M, 2:U, 3:R, 4:K, 5:Y
Eliminated letters: avoids A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N? Yes. So it's valid.

But note: does it have R? Yes, in position 3.

Option: Put R in position 5: _ _ _ _ R
Example: ""LUCRE"" -> L, U, C, R, E -> E eliminated.
""VAPOR"" -> V, A, P, O, R -> A and O eliminated.
""RUMOR"" -> R, U, M, O, R -> O eliminated? And R in position 1 and 5? But position 1 is already known to be not R, so position 1 must be a different letter. However, ""rumor"" starts with R, which is not allowed. So we avoid words starting with R.

Another: ""HUMOR"" -> H, U, M, O, R -> H and O eliminated.
""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> T and O eliminated.

So position 5 is tricky because many words end with R and use common vowels that are eliminated.

Therefore, possible words we have so far:
- With R in position 2: ""CRUMB"", or possibly others.
- With R in position 3: ""MURKY""

We need to consider more words.

Another R in position 5: ""JUICY"" -> J, U, I, C, Y -> I eliminated.
But we need R: ""GUPPY"" -> No R.
""PUPPY"" -> No R.
""LYMPh"" -> Not allowed and has H which is eliminated.

Let me think of words ending with R and without the eliminated vowels: 
Words ending in R: using remaining vowels: U, and consonants.

Example: ""SUGAR"" -> S, U, G, A, R -> S and A eliminated.
""VAPOR"" -> eliminated.
""RADAR"" -> but starts with R and has A and R - multiple issues.

With U: ""ULCUR"" -> not a word.
With U: ""SUPER"" -> S eliminated and E.

Actually, it's hard. Maybe try ""AUDIO"" but doesn't end with R and has A.

Focus on R in position 2 or 3.

We have ""CRUMB"" (R in position 2) and ""MURKY"" (R in position 3).

""CRUMB"": letters C, R, U, M, B
""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y

Both avoid eliminated letters.

We want to choose one that tests more common letters? The remaining common letters: among the available set, common consonants: L, C, D, M, P, U, F, etc.

But note: U is a vowel and we haven't tested it, so it might be present.

Also, we need to consider that there might be two R's? But we don't know, so we should focus on single R for now.

Two candidates: 
- ""CRUMB""
- ""MURKY""

Which one gives more information? 
""CRUMB"" has C, U, M, B and R (which we know). 
""MURKY"" has M, U, R, K, Y.

Both test U and M (common). ""CRUMB"" tests C and B; ""MURKY"" tests K and Y.

C is more common than K or Y, so ""CRUMB"" might be slightly better.

But we don't know. Another word: ""CURVY""? C, U, R, V, Y -> R is in position 3? 
C in position 1, U in 2, R in 3, V in 4, Y in 5. 
Avoids eliminated letters? Yes.

So we have three options:
- ""CRUMB"" (R in 2nd): C, R, U, M, B
- ""CURVY"" (R in 3rd): C, U, R, V, Y
- ""MURKY"" (R in 3rd): M, U, R, K, Y

Another possibility: ""DRAFT"" -> D, R, A, F, T -> A and T eliminated.
Not good.

""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W?, L -> O eliminated? O is eliminated.

We must avoid O so any word containing O is invalid.

Now, ""CRUMB"", ""CURVY"", ""MURKY"". 

But ""CURVY"" uses V and Y, which are less common. ""CRUMB"" uses M and B. 

Alternatively, ""RUGBY""? R, U, G, B, Y -> 
Positions: 1:R -> but we know R cannot be in position 1! So if we start a word with R, it's invalid for position.

""RUGBY"" has R in position 1 -> not allowed. So must avoid.

Therefore, we must not put R in position 1.

Now, among the above, I think ""CRUMB"" is valid and tests more common consonants.

But let's consider ""CURLY"": C, U, R, L, Y -> R in position 3? 
C, U, R, L, Y: positions 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:L, 5:Y. 
Avoids eliminated? Yes.

So another candidate: ""CURLY"": tests C, U, R, L, Y.

L is a common consonant. 

Similarly, ""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> but we can put B at position 1 and R at position 3.

We have several options.

We need to pick one. Let's list:

1. ""CRUMB"" - R in position 2: C, R, U, M, B -> letters: C, R, U, M, B
2. ""CURLY"" - R in position 3: C, U, R, L, Y -> letters: C, U, R, L, Y
3. ""MURKY"" - R in position 3: M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M, U, R, K, Y
4. ""CURVY"" - R in position 3: C, U, R, V, Y -> letters: C, U, R, V, Y

We should avoid starting with R or having R in position 4? We know R cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

To test the position of R, we might pick one choice. For example, if we pick R in position 2, we can rule it out if wrong.

I think ""CURLY"" is a good choice because L is a common letter and we haven't tested it. Also, Y is sometimes a vowel.

But we also have to think: we have eliminated vowels A, E, I, O. So the word must have vowels: U, or Y (as in sky), or possibly other? But the secret word must have at least one vowel.

The remaining vowels are U, and sometimes Y (but Y can be consonant too). So we need to test U and/or Y.

Most words will need a vowel, so U is a good candidate.

Therefore, ""CURLY"" covers U and Y.

Also, common consonants C and L.

So I'll go with ""CURLY"".

But to decide between positions: R in position 3. We haven't tested position 3 before? 
- In guess 1, R was in position 1.
- In guess 2, R was in position 4.
- Now we are testing position 3.

So we are systematically checking positions.

If R is not in position 3, then it must be position 2 or 5? Position 5 we haven't tried.

But we can do that later.

So guess: ""curly"".

But note: we are also testing if L and Y are in the word.

Therefore, I choose ""curly"".

But let me double-check: 
- Secret word has R, not in pos 1 or 4.
- We don't know if it has U, L, Y, C.
- Avoided all eliminated letters.

Yes.

So response: <guess>curly</guess>From the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""raise""**: R is present but not in position 1; A, I, S, E are absent.
- **Guess 2: ""thorn""**: R is present but not in position 4; T, H, O, N are absent.

**Key Insights:**
- R must be in the secret word but **not in positions 1 or 4**, so it can only be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Eliminated letters (absences): A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.
- Remaining available letters (besides R): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

**Strategy for Guess 3:**
- Include R in position 2, 3, or 5 to test its correct placement.
- Use common letters from the remaining pool to maximize information, avoiding eliminated letters.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters like L, U, C, and Y (as pseudovowel).
- Avoid positions tested for R before (position 1 and 4 are ruled out).

**Selection:**
Chose ""**curly**"" because:
- R is in position 3 (untested position).
- Includes new common letters: C, U (vowel), L, Y (vowel substitute).
- Avoids all eliminated letters (A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N).
- Tests U and Y, crucial given the absence of other vowels.
- Provides broad coverage: if U or Y appears, it narrows vowel options; if not, more consonants are ruled out.

So we are left with T, O, N, H, R (but R we know), D, L, U, etc.\n\nSo we should try to include T, O, N, H, D, L, U.\n\nBut we have only 5 letters. We must include R and avoid A, I, S, E.\n\nLet me try to form a word:\n\nOption: ""ROUTE"" -> but E is not allowed. \nOption: ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And R? We must include R! This word doesn\'t have R. So we cannot use it.\n\nWe must include R.\n\nAnother option: ""TROUT"" -> T, R, O, U, T -> has T repeated? That\'s okay. But note: we have R in the second position. And avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.\n\nBut we are testing T, R, O, U. That\'s good.\n\nAnother: ""GROUT"" -> G, R, O, U, T -> same as above but with G instead of T at the start. But we haven\'t tried G.\n\nBut note: we want to test as many new letters as possible. ""TROUT"" uses T, R, O, U. We get to test T, O, U (and R we already know). But we are repeating T? Actually, two T\'s: so we are testing only 4 distinct letters: T, R, O, U.\n\nSimilarly, ""GROUT"" tests G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct letters? G, R, O, U, T -> yes, 5 distinct.\n\nSo ""GROUT"" might be better because it tests 5 new distinct letters (G, R, O, U, T) and we know R is included.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the secret word has G, O, U, T. But that\'s the point of guessing.\n\nAnother candidate: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the fourth position. And tests C, O, U, R, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T -> but no R. So we cannot use that.\n\nWe must have R.\n\nAnother: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. Tests B, R, O, W, N.\n\nBut we haven\'t tried B, O, W, N.\n\nWe can also consider: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. But has M and B.\n\nWe have many options. We should choose one that covers common letters and positions.\n\nBut note: we also want to cover the position of R. Since we know R is not in position 1, we can try to put R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. We don\'t know which, so we might want to try a position that we haven\'t tested? Actually, in the first guess we tested position 1 for R and it was wrong. So we can try a different position.\n\nBut we don\'t have to fix the position of R in this guess? We can try any position as long as it\'s not position 1? Actually, we can even try position 1 again? But that would be wasteful because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 1.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and avoid A, I, S, E, and put R in positions 2,3,4,5:\n\n- Position 2: words like ""CRUST"" (but has S, not allowed), ""GRUNT"" (G, R, U, N, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""PRONG"" (P, R, O, N, G -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""TRUCK"" (T, R, U, C, K -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).\n\n- Position 3: ""CHARM"" (but has A, not allowed), ""BORNE"" (has E, not allowed), ""FORTY"" (F, O, R, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""HORDE"" (has E, not allowed), ""WORDY"" (W, O, R, D, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).\n\n- Position 4: ""ABHOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""ADORE"" (has A and E, not allowed), ""FJORD"" (F, J, O, R, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""THORN"" (T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).\n\n- Position 5: ""LATER"" (has E, not allowed), ""MANOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""RUMOR"" (R, U, M, O, R -> has R repeated? And we don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed. But the word is valid. However, we are using R twice. But we know R is in the word, so if the secret word has two R\'s, that\'s okay. But we are testing R at the end. Also, the first letter is R, which we know is not in the first position? Wait, we are putting R at the end and also at the beginning? That would be two R\'s. But we know the first position cannot be R, so if we put R in the first position again, that would be a waste. So we should avoid putting R in the first position.\n\n  Instead, for position 5: ""VAPOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""TUMOR"" (T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).\n\nNow, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers multiple positions.\n\nI think ""TROUT"" (with R in position 2) or ""FORTY"" (with R in position 3) or ""THORN"" (with R in position 4) or ""TUMOR"" (with R in position 5) are options.\n\nBut let\'s consider the distinct letters:\n\n- ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, R, O, U (4 distinct, T repeated)\n- ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct: G, R, O, U, T\n- ""FORTY"": F, O, R, T, Y -> 5 distinct: F, O, R, T, Y\n- ""THORN"": T, H, O, R, N -> 5 distinct: T, H, O, R, N\n- ""TUMOR"": T, U, M, O, R -> 5 distinct: T, U, M, O, R\n\nWe want to cover more common consonants. The letters T, O, R are common. Then H, N, U, M, F, G, Y are less common.\n\nAmong these, ""THORN"" covers T, H, O, R, N which are all common (H and N are common). Similarly, ""GROUT"" covers G, R, O, U, T (G and U are less common than H and N?).\n\nAccording to letter frequency in English words (5-letter words), the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have ruled out A, I, S, E. So the remaining common ones are R, O, T, N, L, C.\n\nWe haven\'t tried O, T, N, L, C.\n\nSo we should try to include O, T, N, L, C if possible.\n\nBut we must include R. So we can try to form a word with R, O, T, N, and one more.\n\nBut we have 5 letters. So we can have R, O, T, N, and say L? But is there a word ""RONT L""? Not really.\n\nHow about ""CLORT""? Not a word.\n\nWe can try ""TORCH"": T, O, R, C, H -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the third position. And tests T, O, R, C, H.\n\nSimilarly, ""NORTH"": N, O, R, T, H -> same as above but with N instead of C.\n\n""THORN"" we already considered: T, H, O, R, N -> which is the same as NORTH but in different order? Actually, ""THORN"" is a word, and ""NORTH"" is also a word.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI think ""THORN"" is a good candidate because:\n  - It has R in the fourth position (which we haven\'t tested before, since in the first guess R was in position 1).\n  - It uses common letters: T, H, O, R, N (all of which are in the top 12 most common letters in English, except H which is still common).\n  - It avoids A, I, S, E.\n\nAlternatively, ""TORCH"" is also good: T, O, R, C, H.\n\nBut we haven\'t tried C and H. Both are common.\n\nAnother option: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> but we haven\'t tried U. U is less common than O, T, N, etc.\n\nI think ""THORN"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we are trying to find the position of R. By putting R in the fourth position, we are testing that specific position. If we get a minus for R, then we know it\'s not in the fourth position. If we get a check, then we know it is.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing T in the first position, H in the second, O in the third, N in the fifth.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""THORN"".\n\nBut wait, what about the possibility that the word has two R\'s? We are only putting one R. But that\'s okay because if there is another R, we might get a minus for one of the other letters? Actually, we are only testing one R. But if the secret word has two R\'s, then we might not get information about the second R. However, we can handle that in subsequent guesses.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word with two R\'s? But we don\'t know if there is a second R. And we don\'t have many words that avoid A, I, S, E and have two R\'s. For example, ""RURAL"" has A and is not allowed. ""PURER"" has E and is not allowed. ""MURKY"" has no R? M, U, R, K, Y -> only one R. So it\'s hard to find a word with two R\'s without the forbidden letters.\n\nSo we\'ll stick with one R.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""THORN"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  THORN: T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.\n\nSo the guess is ""thorn"".\n\nWe\'ll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (indicated by `-`).\n- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (indicated by `x`).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include R (since it\'s confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 1.\n- The word must exclude A, I, S, and E.\n- To maximize information, I chose a word with common unused letters (T, H, O, N) and placed R in a new position (position 4) to test its location.\n\nThe word ""thorn"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains R in position 4.\n- Uses new common letters (T, H, O, N).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (A, I, S, E).\n\n<guess>thorn</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: thorn -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word but not in position 1.\n- A, I, S, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""thorn"" -> T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\nMeaning:\n- T, H, O, N are not in the word.\n- R is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in this guess and got a minus).\n\nWe also know from Guess 1 that R is not in position 1.\n\nSo now we know:\n- R is present in the word, but not in positions 1 or 4.\n- Therefore, R must be in position 2, 3, or 5 of the secret word.\n\nAdditionally, the following letters are not in the word: A, I, S, E, T, H, O, N.\n\nWe have eliminated 9 letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N. (Note: R is confirmed present.)\n\nNow, we need to come up with a new 5-letter word that:\n- Contains R (exactly, but possibly more, though we don\'t know) in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5.\n- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.\n- Includes new common letters to test.\n\nAvailable letters: The English alphabet minus the eliminated ones.\nEliminated: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.\nSo remaining: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and R (which we must use).\n\nWe note that R is in the word, so our guess must include R in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nTo maximize information, we should:\n1. Pick a word with R in one of the untested positions: 2, 3, or 5 (since position 1 and 4 are ruled out).\n2. Use common remaining letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nCommon letters from the remaining set: L, U, D, M, P, C, etc.\n\nWe can try to form words:\n\nOption: Put R in position 2: _ R _ _ _\nWe need to fill with 4 letters from the remaining set, avoiding the eliminated ones.\n\nExample: ""URBAN"" -> but U, R, B, A, N -> A and N are eliminated. Not allowed.\nAnother: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids eliminated letters? \n- Check: C (ok), R (must), U (ok), M (ok), B (ok). \nBut note: we haven\'t tried these letters. However, the word ""crumb"" is a valid English word.\n\nBut also: ""CRUMB"" has R in position 2? Let\'s see:\nPosition 1: C\nPosition 2: R\nPosition 3: U\nPosition 4: M\nPosition 5: B\n\nYes.\n\nOption: Put R in position 3: _ _ R _ _\nExample: ""LUMPY"" -> but no R. Need R.\n""CLAMP"" -> C, L, A, M, P -> A is eliminated.\n""PLUMB"" -> P, L, U, M, B -> no R.\nWe need a word with R in position 3: _ _ R _ _\n\nExample: ""BERRY"" -> B, E, R, R, Y -> E is eliminated.\n""FERRY"" -> F, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated.\n""PURGE"" -> P, U, R, G, E -> E eliminated.\n\nSo hard to find words without the eliminated vowels. \n\nAnother: ""MYRRH"" -> M, Y, R, R, H -> H is eliminated (from the feedback of thorn: H was x).\nH is out.\n\n""BARMY"" -> B, A, R, M, Y -> A eliminated.\n\nTry: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> \nPositions: 1:M, 2:U, 3:R, 4:K, 5:Y\nEliminated letters: avoids A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N? Yes. So it\'s valid.\n\nBut note: does it have R? Yes, in position 3.\n\nOption: Put R in position 5: _ _ _ _ R\nExample: ""LUCRE"" -> L, U, C, R, E -> E eliminated.\n""VAPOR"" -> V, A, P, O, R -> A and O eliminated.\n""RUMOR"" -> R, U, M, O, R -> O eliminated? And R in position 1 and 5? But position 1 is already known to be not R, so position 1 must be a different letter. However, ""rumor"" starts with R, which is not allowed. So we avoid words starting with R.\n\nAnother: ""HUMOR"" -> H, U, M, O, R -> H and O eliminated.\n""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> T and O eliminated.\n\nSo position 5 is tricky because many words end with R and use common vowels that are eliminated.\n\nTherefore, possible words we have so far:\n- With R in position 2: ""CRUMB"", or possibly others.\n- With R in position 3: ""MURKY""\n\nWe need to consider more words.\n\nAnother R in position 5: ""JUICY"" -> J, U, I, C, Y -> I eliminated.\nBut we need R: ""GUPPY"" -> No R.\n""PUPPY"" -> No R.\n""LYMPh"" -> Not allowed and has H which is eliminated.\n\nLet me think of words ending with R and without the eliminated vowels: \nWords ending in R: using remaining vowels: U, and consonants.\n\nExample: ""SUGAR"" -> S, U, G, A, R -> S and A eliminated.\n""VAPOR"" -> eliminated.\n""RADAR"" -> but starts with R and has A and R - multiple issues.\n\nWith U: ""ULCUR"" -> not a word.\nWith U: ""SUPER"" -> S eliminated and E.\n\nActually, it\'s hard. Maybe try ""AUDIO"" but doesn\'t end with R and has A.\n\nFocus on R in position 2 or 3.\n\nWe have ""CRUMB"" (R in position 2) and ""MURKY"" (R in position 3).\n\n""CRUMB"": letters C, R, U, M, B\n""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y\n\nBoth avoid eliminated letters.\n\nWe want to choose one that tests more common letters? The remaining common letters: among the available set, common consonants: L, C, D, M, P, U, F, etc.\n\nBut note: U is a vowel and we haven\'t tested it, so it might be present.\n\nAlso, we need to consider that there might be two R\'s? But we don\'t know, so we should focus on single R for now.\n\nTwo candidates: \n- ""CRUMB""\n- ""MURKY""\n\nWhich one gives more information? \n""CRUMB"" has C, U, M, B and R (which we know). \n""MURKY"" has M, U, R, K, Y.\n\nBoth test U and M (common). ""CRUMB"" tests C and B; ""MURKY"" tests K and Y.\n\nC is more common than K or Y, so ""CRUMB"" might be slightly better.\n\nBut we don\'t know. Another word: ""CURVY""? C, U, R, V, Y -> R is in position 3? \nC in position 1, U in 2, R in 3, V in 4, Y in 5. \nAvoids eliminated letters? Yes.\n\nSo we have three options:\n- ""CRUMB"" (R in 2nd): C, R, U, M, B\n- ""CURVY"" (R in 3rd): C, U, R, V, Y\n- ""MURKY"" (R in 3rd): M, U, R, K, Y\n\nAnother possibility: ""DRAFT"" -> D, R, A, F, T -> A and T eliminated.\nNot good.\n\n""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W?, L -> O eliminated? O is eliminated.\n\nWe must avoid O so any word containing O is invalid.\n\nNow, ""CRUMB"", ""CURVY"", ""MURKY"". \n\nBut ""CURVY"" uses V and Y, which are less common. ""CRUMB"" uses M and B. \n\nAlternatively, ""RUGBY""? R, U, G, B, Y -> \nPositions: 1:R -> but we know R cannot be in position 1! So if we start a word with R, it\'s invalid for position.\n\n""RUGBY"" has R in position 1 -> not allowed. So must avoid.\n\nTherefore, we must not put R in position 1.\n\nNow, among the above, I think ""CRUMB"" is valid and tests more common consonants.\n\nBut let\'s consider ""CURLY"": C, U, R, L, Y -> R in position 3? \nC, U, R, L, Y: positions 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:L, 5:Y. \nAvoids eliminated? Yes.\n\nSo another candidate: ""CURLY"": tests C, U, R, L, Y.\n\nL is a common consonant. \n\nSimilarly, ""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> but we can put B at position 1 and R at position 3.\n\nWe have several options.\n\nWe need to pick one. Let\'s list:\n\n1. ""CRUMB"" - R in position 2: C, R, U, M, B -> letters: C, R, U, M, B\n2. ""CURLY"" - R in position 3: C, U, R, L, Y -> letters: C, U, R, L, Y\n3. ""MURKY"" - R in position 3: M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M, U, R, K, Y\n4. ""CURVY"" - R in position 3: C, U, R, V, Y -> letters: C, U, R, V, Y\n\nWe should avoid starting with R or having R in position 4? We know R cannot be in positions 1 or 4.\n\nTo test the position of R, we might pick one choice. For example, if we pick R in position 2, we can rule it out if wrong.\n\nI think ""CURLY"" is a good choice because L is a common letter and we haven\'t tested it. Also, Y is sometimes a vowel.\n\nBut we also have to think: we have eliminated vowels A, E, I, O. So the word must have vowels: U, or Y (as in sky), or possibly other? But the secret word must have at least one vowel.\n\nThe remaining vowels are U, and sometimes Y (but Y can be consonant too). So we need to test U and/or Y.\n\nMost words will need a vowel, so U is a good candidate.\n\nTherefore, ""CURLY"" covers U and Y.\n\nAlso, common consonants C and L.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CURLY"".\n\nBut to decide between positions: R in position 3. We haven\'t tested position 3 before? \n- In guess 1, R was in position 1.\n- In guess 2, R was in position 4.\n- Now we are testing position 3.\n\nSo we are systematically checking positions.\n\nIf R is not in position 3, then it must be position 2 or 5? Position 5 we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut we can do that later.\n\nSo guess: ""curly"".\n\nBut note: we are also testing if L and Y are in the word.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""curly"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n- Secret word has R, not in pos 1 or 4.\n- We don\'t know if it has U, L, Y, C.\n- Avoided all eliminated letters.\n\nYes.\n\nSo response: <guess>curly</guess>From the previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""raise""**: R is present but not in position 1; A, I, S, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2: ""thorn""**: R is present but not in position 4; T, H, O, N are absent.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- R must be in the secret word but **not in positions 1 or 4**, so it can only be in position 2, 3, or 5.\n- Eliminated letters (absences): A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.\n- Remaining available letters (besides R): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n**Strategy for Guess 3:**\n- Include R in position 2, 3, or 5 to test its correct placement.\n- Use common letters from the remaining pool to maximize information, avoiding eliminated letters.\n- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters like L, U, C, and Y (as pseudovowel).\n- Avoid positions tested for R before (position 1 and 4 are ruled out).\n\n**Selection:**\nChose ""**curly**"" because:\n- R is in position 3 (untested position).\n- Includes new common letters: C, U (vowel), L, Y (vowel substitute).\n- Avoids all eliminated letters (A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N).\n- Tests U and Y, crucial given the absence of other vowels.\n- Provides broad coverage: if U or Y appears, it narrows vowel options; if not, more consonants are ruled out.\n\n<guess>curly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: thorn -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\nGuess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Meaning: R is in the word but not in position 1; A, I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""thorn"" -> T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
Meaning: T, H, O, N are not in the word; R is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 3: ""curly"" -> C(✓) U(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
Meaning: 
  - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
  - U is in the word but not in position 2.
  - R is in the word but not in position 3.
  - L and Y are not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has the letter C in the first position. So the word starts with C.

2. The letter R is in the word, but we know it is not in position 1 (from guess 1), not in position 4 (from guess 2), and not in position 3 (from guess 3). Therefore, R must be in position 2 or 5.

3. The letter U is in the word, but not in position 2 (from guess 3).

4. The following letters are not in the word: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y.

   So eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y.

5. We have used the letters: C, U, R (and we know they are in the word) and the eliminated ones.

6. The secret word has the form: C _ _ _ _

We know R must be in position 2 or 5. But note: if R is in position 2, then we have C R _ _ _

But in guess 3, we had ""curly"" which is C U R L Y. We got U as present but not in position 2. So if R is in position 2, then U cannot be in position 2 (which we already know) but must be somewhere else.

Also, we know U is in the word but not in position 2, so U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

But we have only 5 positions.

Now, we need to form a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains R (in position 2 or 5) and U (in position 3, 4, or 5).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and the letters we know: C, U, R.

But C is fixed at position 1, and R and U must be included.

We have two cases for R: position 2 or 5.

Case 1: R in position 2 -> word: C R _ _ _
Then U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Case 2: R in position 5 -> word: C _ _ _ R
Then U must be in position 2, 3, or 4? But wait, position 2 is available for U? However, in guess 3, we had U in position 2 and it was present but not in that position. So U cannot be in position 2. Therefore, in this case, U must be in position 3 or 4.

But note: we also have to fill the remaining positions with letters from the available set.

We need to choose a word that tests these possibilities and uses new letters to gain information.

We have 6 guesses total, and we are on guess 4.

We can try to resolve the position of R and U.

Let's list possible words.

First, Case 1: C R _ _ _

We need to put U in one of the last three positions and fill the others with available letters.

For example:
- Position 3: U -> then we have C R U _ _
  We need two more letters, avoiding eliminated ones. And the word must be valid.
  Example: ""CRUMB"" -> but M and B are available? Yes, but we have U in position 3. But ""crumb"" is C R U M B -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:U, 4:M, 5:B.
  But we know from guess 3 that U is present but not in position 2, which is satisfied. And we are putting U in position 3.

  However, we haven't tested M and B. So it's a candidate.

  But note: we also have to consider that U might not be in position 3? We are testing it.

  Alternatively, we could put U in position 4: C R _ U _
  Example: ""CRWTH"" -> but W and H? H is eliminated. Not allowed.
  ""CRUMP"" -> C, R, U, M, P -> U in position 3? No, if U is in position 4: then it would be C R ? U ? -> for example, ""CRUMP"" has U in position 3? C(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5). So that's U in position 3.

  To have U in position 4: we need a word like C R ? U ? 
  Example: ""CRUSY"" -> but S and Y eliminated.
  ""CRUFT"" -> F and T? T is eliminated.

  Another: ""CRUDY"" -> D and Y? Y eliminated.

  It's hard to find words with U in position 4 for this pattern.

  Similarly, U in position 5: C R _ _ U
  Example: ""CRUSY"" -> again, S and Y eliminated.
  ""CRUMU"" -> not a word.

  So perhaps the only common word for case 1 is with U in position 3: like ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".

Now, Case 2: R in position 5 -> C _ _ _ R

Then U must be in position 3 or 4 (since not 2).

If U in position 3: C _ U _ R
Example: ""CURRY"" -> but R repeated? And Y? Also, we have R in position 5 and also in position 4? ""CURRY"" is C U R R Y -> so R in position 3 and 4? But we are putting R only in position 5? Actually, the word would be: position 1:C, 2:?, 3:U, 4:?, 5:R.

But we need to fill position 2 and 4.

Example: ""CURVY"" -> but V and Y? Y eliminated.
""BURQA"" -> B, U, R, Q, A -> A eliminated.
""JUROR"" -> J, U, R, O, R -> O eliminated and R repeated.

Another: ""CURED"" -> E and D? E eliminated.

It's difficult.

If U in position 4: C _ _ U R
Example: ""CUPUR"" -> not a word.
""CAPER"" -> A and E eliminated.
""COVER"" -> O and E eliminated.

""CAULK"" -> A and L eliminated.

So case 2 seems harder to find words.

But we have a candidate for case 1: ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have more than one U or R? But we don't have evidence.

Another word for case 1: ""CRUFT"" -> but T eliminated.

""CRUDY"" -> Y eliminated.

So ""CRUMB"" and ""CRUMP"" are the main candidates.

But we also have the possibility that U is not in position 3? In case 1, we have to put U in 3,4, or5, but we found that 4 and5 are hard. So maybe U is in position 3.

But we don't know. We need to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests R in position 5 and U in position 3 or4.

But we found it hard to form words. Let me try again.

For case 2, R in position 5: C _ _ _ R

With U in position 3: C _ U _ R

Available letters for position 2 and 4: from B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Example: ""CUMAR"" -> not a word.
""KUDZU"" -> K, U, D, Z, U -> but we need R at the end? No, we have R at the end. ""KUDZU"" is not ending with R.

""CHUFA"" -> H and A eliminated.

""JUMAR"" -> J, U, M, A, R -> A eliminated.

""PUKER"" -> P, U, K, E, R -> E eliminated.

""MUJIK"" -> no R.

It's very hard.

With U in position 4: C _ _ U R

Example: ""CABER"" -> A and E eliminated.
""COWER"" -> O and E eliminated.
""CAVER"" -> A and E.
""COUPR"" -> not a word.

""CUPPER"" -> too long.

Perhaps ""CUBER"" -> C, U, B, E, R -> E eliminated.

I think case 2 is not promising because we cannot find common words.

Therefore, it's more likely that R is in position 2 and U in position 3.

So we can guess ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".

But we also have to consider that there might be other words.

Another possibility: what if the word has U in position 4 or 5? But we couldn't find words. So maybe we should go with ""CRUMB"".

But note: we have feedback that U is present but not in position 2. In ""CRUMB"", we put U in position 3, which is allowed.

Also, we are testing M and B.

But we have another constraint: we know R is in the word and must be in 2 or 5. In ""CRUMB"", R is in position 2.

So let's choose ""CRUMB"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""CRUMB"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests R in position 5 to confirm or deny.

But we don't have a good word for that.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has R in position 5 and U in position 3, but we need to find one.

For example, ""CURER"" -> but E and R repeated? And E eliminated.

""DUVET"" -> no R and E.

I think we should go with ""CRUMB"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""CRUMB"", and if the secret word is ""CRUMB"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on M and B.

But we are on guess 4, so we have two more guesses.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more new letters to get more information.

For example, we know the first letter is C, and we need to test position 2 and 5 for R.

We can try a word that has R in position 5 and also tests other common letters.

But we don't know if U is in position 3,4, or5? We know U is present, so we must include U.

So we must include U and R.

So let's list all possible words that start with C, contain U and R, avoid eliminated letters, and have R in position 2 or 5.

First, R in position 2: then U in 3,4,5.

We have:
- U in 3: C R U ? ? 
  Words: ""CRUMB"", ""CRUMP"", ""CRUFT"" (T eliminated), ""CRUD"" (too short), ""CRUDS"" (S eliminated), ""CRUDY"" (Y eliminated). So only ""CRUMB"" and ""CRUMP"".

- U in 4: C R ? U ? 
  Words: ""CRWTH"" (W and H? H eliminated, and not common), ""CRUOR"" (O and R? O eliminated), ""CRUMP"" has U in 3, not 4. I can't find a common word.

- U in 5: C R ? ? U
  Words: ""CRUSY"" (S and Y eliminated), ""CRU"" (too short). No common words.

So only realistic is U in 3: ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".

Now, for R in position 5: C ? ? ? R, with U in 3 or 4.

- U in 3: C ? U ? R
  Words: ""CURRY"" (R repeated and Y? Also, we need to fill: if U in 3, then positions: 1:C, 2:?, 3:U, 4:?, 5:R. Example: ""CURAR"" (not common, and A), ""CURER"" (E), ""CURRS"" (S and R repeated). No good.

- U in 4: C ? ? U R
  Words: ""CUR"" (too short), ""CURVY"" (V and Y? Y eliminated), ""CURRY"" (U in 3? not 4). I can't find a word.

Therefore, the only feasible words are ""CRUMB"" and ""CRUMP"".

I think ""CRUMB"" is slightly more common? Or ""CRUMP"".

But we can choose either.

Let's pick ""CRUMB"".

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't have evidence.

So I'll go with ""CRUMB"".

But wait, in the feedback for guess 3, we have U as present but not in position 2. In ""CRUMB"", U is in position 3, which is fine.

Also, R is in position 2, which is a possible position.

So guess: ""crumb""

But let's write it in uppercase? The game uses uppercase? But in the response, we can write in lowercase and it will be converted? Or we should write in uppercase? The previous guesses were in lowercase in the response, but the feedback in uppercase? Actually, in the user message, the feedback is in uppercase for letters, but the guess words are in lowercase in the response.

So I'll write <guess>crumb</guess>

But note: we are not sure if ""crumb"" is the word, but it's a guess to get information.

If it's not, we get feedback on M and B.

But we have two more guesses.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't assume R in position 2, but tests both possibilities? But it's hard.

Another word: ""CURDY"" -> but Y eliminated.

I think ""CRUMB"" is the best bet.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  - R is present but not in position 1 (R must be in position 2, 3, or 5).  
  - A, I, S, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""thorn""**  
  - R is present but not in position 4 (narrowing R to position 2, 3, or 5).  
  - T, H, O, N are absent.  

- **Guess 3: ""curly""**  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (secret word starts with C).  
  - U is present but not in position 2 (U must be in position 3, 4, or 5).  
  - R is present but not in position 3 (narrowing R to position 2 or 5).  
  - L, Y are absent.  

### Consolidated Insights
1. **Secret word structure**: `C _ _ _ _` (C is fixed at position 1).  
2. **Confirmed present letters**:  
   - R (must be in position 2 or 5).  
   - U (must be in position 3, 4, or 5).  
3. **Absent letters**: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y (15 letters eliminated).  
4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and confirmed C, U, R).  
5. **Constraints**:  
   - R and U cannot share positions (R in 2/5, U in 3/4/5), so the word must accommodate both.  
   - Position 2 is open only to R (if R is there) or a new letter.  
   - No eliminated letters can be used.  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Goal**: Resolve R and U positions while testing new letters.  
  - R must be in position 2 or 5.  
  - U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Prioritize words with R in position 2 (untested position for R) and U in position 3 (common pattern).  
  - Use new high-frequency consonants (e.g., M, B) to maximize information.  
  - Avoid wasting letters; all guesses must include R and U.  
- **Word choice**: ""**crumb**"" fits perfectly:  
  - Starts with C (position 1 correct).  
  - R in position 2 (tests if R is here).  
  - U in position 3 (tests if U is here).  
  - M and B are new common letters (untested).  
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.  

If ""crumb"" is incorrect, feedback on M and B will further narrow possibilities (e.g., if M or B is present/absent). With 2 guesses left, this maintains flexibility.

<guess>crumb</guess>",crumb,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Meaning: R is in the word but not in position 1; A, I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""thorn"" -> T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
Meaning: T, H, O, N are not in the word; R is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 3: ""curly"" -> C(✓) U(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
Meaning: 
  - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
  - U is in the word but not in position 2.
  - R is in the word but not in position 3.
  - L and Y are not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has the letter C in the first position. So the word starts with C.

2. The letter R is in the word, but we know it is not in position 1 (from guess 1), not in position 4 (from guess 2), and not in position 3 (from guess 3). Therefore, R must be in position 2 or 5.

3. The letter U is in the word, but not in position 2 (from guess 3).

4. The following letters are not in the word: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y.

   So eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y.

5. We have used the letters: C, U, R (and we know they are in the word) and the eliminated ones.

6. The secret word has the form: C _ _ _ _

We know R must be in position 2 or 5. But note: if R is in position 2, then we have C R _ _ _

But in guess 3, we had ""curly"" which is C U R L Y. We got U as present but not in position 2. So if R is in position 2, then U cannot be in position 2 (which we already know) but must be somewhere else.

Also, we know U is in the word but not in position 2, so U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

But we have only 5 positions.

Now, we need to form a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains R (in position 2 or 5) and U (in position 3, 4, or 5).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and the letters we know: C, U, R.

But C is fixed at position 1, and R and U must be included.

We have two cases for R: position 2 or 5.

Case 1: R in position 2 -> word: C R _ _ _
Then U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Case 2: R in position 5 -> word: C _ _ _ R
Then U must be in position 2, 3, or 4? But wait, position 2 is available for U? However, in guess 3, we had U in position 2 and it was present but not in that position. So U cannot be in position 2. Therefore, in this case, U must be in position 3 or 4.

But note: we also have to fill the remaining positions with letters from the available set.

We need to choose a word that tests these possibilities and uses new letters to gain information.

We have 6 guesses total, and we are on guess 4.

We can try to resolve the position of R and U.

Let's list possible words.

First, Case 1: C R _ _ _

We need to put U in one of the last three positions and fill the others with available letters.

For example:
- Position 3: U -> then we have C R U _ _
  We need two more letters, avoiding eliminated ones. And the word must be valid.
  Example: ""CRUMB"" -> but M and B are available? Yes, but we have U in position 3. But ""crumb"" is C R U M B -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:U, 4:M, 5:B.
  But we know from guess 3 that U is present but not in position 2, which is satisfied. And we are putting U in position 3.

  However, we haven't tested M and B. So it's a candidate.

  But note: we also have to consider that U might not be in position 3? We are testing it.

  Alternatively, we could put U in position 4: C R _ U _
  Example: ""CRWTH"" -> but W and H? H is eliminated. Not allowed.
  ""CRUMP"" -> C, R, U, M, P -> U in position 3? No, if U is in position 4: then it would be C R ? U ? -> for example, ""CRUMP"" has U in position 3? C(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5). So that's U in position 3.

  To have U in position 4: we need a word like C R ? U ? 
  Example: ""CRUSY"" -> but S and Y eliminated.
  ""CRUFT"" -> F and T? T is eliminated.

  Another: ""CRUDY"" -> D and Y? Y eliminated.

  It's hard to find words with U in position 4 for this pattern.

  Similarly, U in position 5: C R _ _ U
  Example: ""CRUSY"" -> again, S and Y eliminated.
  ""CRUMU"" -> not a word.

  So perhaps the only common word for case 1 is with U in position 3: like ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".

Now, Case 2: R in position 5 -> C _ _ _ R

Then U must be in position 3 or 4 (since not 2).

If U in position 3: C _ U _ R
Example: ""CURRY"" -> but R repeated? And Y? Also, we have R in position 5 and also in position 4? ""CURRY"" is C U R R Y -> so R in position 3 and 4? But we are putting R only in position 5? Actually, the word would be: position 1:C, 2:?, 3:U, 4:?, 5:R.

But we need to fill position 2 and 4.

Example: ""CURVY"" -> but V and Y? Y eliminated.
""BURQA"" -> B, U, R, Q, A -> A eliminated.
""JUROR"" -> J, U, R, O, R -> O eliminated and R repeated.

Another: ""CURED"" -> E and D? E eliminated.

It's difficult.

If U in position 4: C _ _ U R
Example: ""CUPUR"" -> not a word.
""CAPER"" -> A and E eliminated.
""COVER"" -> O and E eliminated.

""CAULK"" -> A and L eliminated.

So case 2 seems harder to find words.

But we have a candidate for case 1: ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have more than one U or R? But we don't have evidence.

Another word for case 1: ""CRUFT"" -> but T eliminated.

""CRUDY"" -> Y eliminated.

So ""CRUMB"" and ""CRUMP"" are the main candidates.

But we also have the possibility that U is not in position 3? In case 1, we have to put U in 3,4, or5, but we found that 4 and5 are hard. So maybe U is in position 3.

But we don't know. We need to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests R in position 5 and U in position 3 or4.

But we found it hard to form words. Let me try again.

For case 2, R in position 5: C _ _ _ R

With U in position 3: C _ U _ R

Available letters for position 2 and 4: from B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Example: ""CUMAR"" -> not a word.
""KUDZU"" -> K, U, D, Z, U -> but we need R at the end? No, we have R at the end. ""KUDZU"" is not ending with R.

""CHUFA"" -> H and A eliminated.

""JUMAR"" -> J, U, M, A, R -> A eliminated.

""PUKER"" -> P, U, K, E, R -> E eliminated.

""MUJIK"" -> no R.

It's very hard.

With U in position 4: C _ _ U R

Example: ""CABER"" -> A and E eliminated.
""COWER"" -> O and E eliminated.
""CAVER"" -> A and E.
""COUPR"" -> not a word.

""CUPPER"" -> too long.

Perhaps ""CUBER"" -> C, U, B, E, R -> E eliminated.

I think case 2 is not promising because we cannot find common words.

Therefore, it's more likely that R is in position 2 and U in position 3.

So we can guess ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".

But we also have to consider that there might be other words.

Another possibility: what if the word has U in position 4 or 5? But we couldn't find words. So maybe we should go with ""CRUMB"".

But note: we have feedback that U is present but not in position 2. In ""CRUMB"", we put U in position 3, which is allowed.

Also, we are testing M and B.

But we have another constraint: we know R is in the word and must be in 2 or 5. In ""CRUMB"", R is in position 2.

So let's choose ""CRUMB"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""CRUMB"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests R in position 5 to confirm or deny.

But we don't have a good word for that.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has R in position 5 and U in position 3, but we need to find one.

For example, ""CURER"" -> but E and R repeated? And E eliminated.

""DUVET"" -> no R and E.

I think we should go with ""CRUMB"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""CRUMB"", and if the secret word is ""CRUMB"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on M and B.

But we are on guess 4, so we have two more guesses.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more new letters to get more information.

For example, we know the first letter is C, and we need to test position 2 and 5 for R.

We can try a word that has R in position 5 and also tests other common letters.

But we don't know if U is in position 3,4, or5? We know U is present, so we must include U.

So we must include U and R.

So let's list all possible words that start with C, contain U and R, avoid eliminated letters, and have R in position 2 or 5.

First, R in position 2: then U in 3,4,5.

We have:
- U in 3: C R U ? ? 
  Words: ""CRUMB"", ""CRUMP"", ""CRUFT"" (T eliminated), ""CRUD"" (too short), ""CRUDS"" (S eliminated), ""CRUDY"" (Y eliminated). So only ""CRUMB"" and ""CRUMP"".

- U in 4: C R ? U ? 
  Words: ""CRWTH"" (W and H? H eliminated, and not common), ""CRUOR"" (O and R? O eliminated), ""CRUMP"" has U in 3, not 4. I can't find a common word.

- U in 5: C R ? ? U
  Words: ""CRUSY"" (S and Y eliminated), ""CRU"" (too short). No common words.

So only realistic is U in 3: ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".

Now, for R in position 5: C ? ? ? R, with U in 3 or 4.

- U in 3: C ? U ? R
  Words: ""CURRY"" (R repeated and Y? Also, we need to fill: if U in 3, then positions: 1:C, 2:?, 3:U, 4:?, 5:R. Example: ""CURAR"" (not common, and A), ""CURER"" (E), ""CURRS"" (S and R repeated). No good.

- U in 4: C ? ? U R
  Words: ""CUR"" (too short), ""CURVY"" (V and Y? Y eliminated), ""CURRY"" (U in 3? not 4). I can't find a word.

Therefore, the only feasible words are ""CRUMB"" and ""CRUMP"".

I think ""CRUMB"" is slightly more common? Or ""CRUMP"".

But we can choose either.

Let's pick ""CRUMB"".

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't have evidence.

So I'll go with ""CRUMB"".

But wait, in the feedback for guess 3, we have U as present but not in position 2. In ""CRUMB"", U is in position 3, which is fine.

Also, R is in position 2, which is a possible position.

So guess: ""crumb""

But let's write it in uppercase? The game uses uppercase? But in the response, we can write in lowercase and it will be converted? Or we should write in uppercase? The previous guesses were in lowercase in the response, but the feedback in uppercase? Actually, in the user message, the feedback is in uppercase for letters, but the guess words are in lowercase in the response.

So I'll write <guess>crumb</guess>

But note: we are not sure if ""crumb"" is the word, but it's a guess to get information.

If it's not, we get feedback on M and B.

But we have two more guesses.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't assume R in position 2, but tests both possibilities? But it's hard.

Another word: ""CURDY"" -> but Y eliminated.

I think ""CRUMB"" is the best bet.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game and need to make our first guess.
 For the first guess, we don't have any prior feedback, so we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain.
 A common strategy is to choose a word with five distinct letters and that includes common vowels and consonants.
 Words like ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""SOARE"", ""SALET"", etc., are often used. Let's pick one that covers common letters.

 Looking at common letters in 5-letter words:
 Vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y)
 Consonants: R, S, T, L, N, etc.

 The word ""CRANE"" is a good starter because it has:
  - C, R, A, N, E: which are common letters and includes two vowels (A and E) and three common consonants.

 Alternatively, ""ROATE"" is another common starting word that has been shown to be effective.

 However, I recall that ""RAISE"" is also a popular starting word because it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

 Let's compare:

 Option 1: CRANE -> C, R, A, N, E
 Option 2: ROAST -> R, O, A, S, T (but note that O and A are vowels, and S, T, R are common)
 Option 3: RAISE -> R, A, I, S, E (three vowels: A, I, E and consonants R, S)

 Since we are limited to the first guess and want to cover more vowels and common consonants, I think ""RAISE"" is a strong candidate.

 But note: we must make sure the word exists in the word list.

 I'll choose ""RAISE"" as it covers A, E, I (three common vowels) and R, S (common consonants).

 So, the first guess is ""RAISE"".I chose ""RAISE"" as the first guess because it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing the likelihood of hitting letters in the secret word. This provides a strong foundation for narrowing down possibilities based on the feedback's ✓, -, and x indicators.

<guess>raise</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
  R: - (meaning R is in the secret word but not in the first position)
  A: x (A is not in the secret word)
  I: x (I is not in the secret word)
  S: x (S is not in the secret word)
  E: x (E is not in the secret word)

So, from this feedback, we know:
  - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the first position.
  - The letters A, I, S, E are not in the secret word at all.

Also, note that the secret word does not contain: A, I, S, E.

We have 6 tries, and this is the second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
  - Must include the letter R (since we know it's in the word) but not in the first position.
  - Must avoid the letters A, I, S, E.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new common letters and positions.

Let's think about the position of R:
  Since in ""raise"", R was in the first position and got a minus (-), that means R is in the word but not at position 1. So R must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We can try to put R in one of these positions and use other common letters that we haven't tried yet.

What letters haven't we tried? We have tried R, A, I, S, E. So we should avoid those except R.

Common consonants and vowels we haven't used: 
  Vowels: O, U (and sometimes Y, but we'll avoid Y for now unless necessary)
  Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also know that the word has 5 letters and one of them is R.

We can consider words that have R in the second, third, fourth, or fifth position.

Let's try to think of common words that fit:

Option 1: Put R in the second position. Then the word pattern: _ R _ _ _
  We need to avoid A, I, S, E. So the first letter can be one of the unused consonants or vowels (but note: first letter is often a consonant).

  Example: ""CRUST"" -> but we have to check if it avoids A, I, S, E? 
    C, R, U, S, T -> S is in the word, but we know S is not in the secret word. So we cannot use S.

  We must avoid S, so we cannot use words containing S.

  Another: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. But note: we haven't tried P, O, U, D.

  However, we also know that the secret word has R, so that's covered.

Option 2: Put R in the third position: _ _ R _ _
  Example: ""CHORD"" -> C, H, O, R, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

Option 3: Put R in the fourth position: _ _ _ R _
  Example: ""THORN"" -> T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

Option 4: Put R in the fifth position: _ _ _ _ R
  Example: ""LATER"" -> but LATER has E and R, but E is not allowed. So we need to avoid E. 
  Instead: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R -> but A is not allowed. 
  Another: ""MINOR"" -> has I and A? No, but I is not allowed. 
  So let's try: ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

We want to cover as many new letters as possible. Also, note that we have 5 positions to fill and we want to test common letters.

Let's list the available letters: we have 21 consonants (excluding R, S) and 2 vowels (O, U) that we haven't tried? Actually, we have more vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y. But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.

We can also use Y as a vowel? For example, in words like ""DRYLY"" but that has repeated letters and we don't know if repeated letters are allowed? The rules don't say, but typically words can have repeated letters. However, in this feedback, we don't have any information about repeated letters. But since we are avoiding A, I, S, E, and we know R is in the word, we don't know if R appears more than once? But we only have one R so far.

But note: the feedback for ""raise"" only showed one R and it was present (but in wrong position). If there were two R's, then the feedback would have shown two minuses or one correct and one minus? But in this case, we only have one R. So we don't know if there are multiple R's. We should consider that possibility, but for now, we assume at least one R.

We want to maximize information. So we should choose a word that has:
  - R in a position that is not the first (so positions 2,3,4,5)
  - Uses common letters that we haven't tried: for example, T, O, U, L, N, etc.

Common letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U ... but we have already ruled out A, I, S, E. So we are left with T, O, N, H, R (but R we know), D, L, U, etc.

So we should try to include T, O, N, H, D, L, U.

But we have only 5 letters. We must include R and avoid A, I, S, E.

Let me try to form a word:

Option: ""ROUTE"" -> but E is not allowed. 
Option: ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And R? We must include R! This word doesn't have R. So we cannot use it.

We must include R.

Another option: ""TROUT"" -> T, R, O, U, T -> has T repeated? That's okay. But note: we have R in the second position. And avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

But we are testing T, R, O, U. That's good.

Another: ""GROUT"" -> G, R, O, U, T -> same as above but with G instead of T at the start. But we haven't tried G.

But note: we want to test as many new letters as possible. ""TROUT"" uses T, R, O, U. We get to test T, O, U (and R we already know). But we are repeating T? Actually, two T's: so we are testing only 4 distinct letters: T, R, O, U.

Similarly, ""GROUT"" tests G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct letters? G, R, O, U, T -> yes, 5 distinct.

So ""GROUT"" might be better because it tests 5 new distinct letters (G, R, O, U, T) and we know R is included.

But note: we are not sure if the secret word has G, O, U, T. But that's the point of guessing.

Another candidate: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the fourth position. And tests C, O, U, R, T.

Similarly, ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T -> but no R. So we cannot use that.

We must have R.

Another: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. Tests B, R, O, W, N.

But we haven't tried B, O, W, N.

We can also consider: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. But has M and B.

We have many options. We should choose one that covers common letters and positions.

But note: we also want to cover the position of R. Since we know R is not in position 1, we can try to put R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. We don't know which, so we might want to try a position that we haven't tested? Actually, in the first guess we tested position 1 for R and it was wrong. So we can try a different position.

But we don't have to fix the position of R in this guess? We can try any position as long as it's not position 1? Actually, we can even try position 1 again? But that would be wasteful because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 1.

Let me list some words that have R and avoid A, I, S, E, and put R in positions 2,3,4,5:

- Position 2: words like ""CRUST"" (but has S, not allowed), ""GRUNT"" (G, R, U, N, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""PRONG"" (P, R, O, N, G -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""TRUCK"" (T, R, U, C, K -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 3: ""CHARM"" (but has A, not allowed), ""BORNE"" (has E, not allowed), ""FORTY"" (F, O, R, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""HORDE"" (has E, not allowed), ""WORDY"" (W, O, R, D, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 4: ""ABHOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""ADORE"" (has A and E, not allowed), ""FJORD"" (F, J, O, R, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""THORN"" (T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

- Position 5: ""LATER"" (has E, not allowed), ""MANOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""RUMOR"" (R, U, M, O, R -> has R repeated? And we don't know if repeated letters are allowed. But the word is valid. However, we are using R twice. But we know R is in the word, so if the secret word has two R's, that's okay. But we are testing R at the end. Also, the first letter is R, which we know is not in the first position? Wait, we are putting R at the end and also at the beginning? That would be two R's. But we know the first position cannot be R, so if we put R in the first position again, that would be a waste. So we should avoid putting R in the first position.

  Instead, for position 5: ""VAPOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""TUMOR"" (T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).

Now, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers multiple positions.

I think ""TROUT"" (with R in position 2) or ""FORTY"" (with R in position 3) or ""THORN"" (with R in position 4) or ""TUMOR"" (with R in position 5) are options.

But let's consider the distinct letters:

- ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, R, O, U (4 distinct, T repeated)
- ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct: G, R, O, U, T
- ""FORTY"": F, O, R, T, Y -> 5 distinct: F, O, R, T, Y
- ""THORN"": T, H, O, R, N -> 5 distinct: T, H, O, R, N
- ""TUMOR"": T, U, M, O, R -> 5 distinct: T, U, M, O, R

We want to cover more common consonants. The letters T, O, R are common. Then H, N, U, M, F, G, Y are less common.

Among these, ""THORN"" covers T, H, O, R, N which are all common (H and N are common). Similarly, ""GROUT"" covers G, R, O, U, T (G and U are less common than H and N?).

According to letter frequency in English words (5-letter words), the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have ruled out A, I, S, E. So the remaining common ones are R, O, T, N, L, C.

We haven't tried O, T, N, L, C.

So we should try to include O, T, N, L, C if possible.

But we must include R. So we can try to form a word with R, O, T, N, and one more.

But we have 5 letters. So we can have R, O, T, N, and say L? But is there a word ""RONT L""? Not really.

How about ""CLORT""? Not a word.

We can try ""TORCH"": T, O, R, C, H -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the third position. And tests T, O, R, C, H.

Similarly, ""NORTH"": N, O, R, T, H -> same as above but with N instead of C.

""THORN"" we already considered: T, H, O, R, N -> which is the same as NORTH but in different order? Actually, ""THORN"" is a word, and ""NORTH"" is also a word.

Both are valid.

I think ""THORN"" is a good candidate because:
  - It has R in the fourth position (which we haven't tested before, since in the first guess R was in position 1).
  - It uses common letters: T, H, O, R, N (all of which are in the top 12 most common letters in English, except H which is still common).
  - It avoids A, I, S, E.

Alternatively, ""TORCH"" is also good: T, O, R, C, H.

But we haven't tried C and H. Both are common.

Another option: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> but we haven't tried U. U is less common than O, T, N, etc.

I think ""THORN"" is a solid choice.

But note: we are trying to find the position of R. By putting R in the fourth position, we are testing that specific position. If we get a minus for R, then we know it's not in the fourth position. If we get a check, then we know it is.

Similarly, we are testing T in the first position, H in the second, O in the third, N in the fifth.

So let's go with ""THORN"".

But wait, what about the possibility that the word has two R's? We are only putting one R. But that's okay because if there is another R, we might get a minus for one of the other letters? Actually, we are only testing one R. But if the secret word has two R's, then we might not get information about the second R. However, we can handle that in subsequent guesses.

Alternatively, we could choose a word with two R's? But we don't know if there is a second R. And we don't have many words that avoid A, I, S, E and have two R's. For example, ""RURAL"" has A and is not allowed. ""PURER"" has E and is not allowed. ""MURKY"" has no R? M, U, R, K, Y -> only one R. So it's hard to find a word with two R's without the forbidden letters.

So we'll stick with one R.

Therefore, I choose ""THORN"".

But let me confirm: 
  THORN: T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

So the guess is ""thorn"".

We'll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":
- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (indicated by `-`).
- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (indicated by `x`).

For the second guess:
- The word must include R (since it's confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 1.
- The word must exclude A, I, S, and E.
- To maximize information, I chose a word with common unused letters (T, H, O, N) and placed R in a new position (position 4) to test its location.

The word ""thorn"" fits these criteria:
- Contains R in position 4.
- Uses new common letters (T, H, O, N).
- Avoids forbidden letters (A, I, S, E).

<guess>thorn</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: thorn -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A, I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""thorn"" -> T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
Meaning:
- T, H, O, N are not in the word.
- R is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in this guess and got a minus).

We also know from Guess 1 that R is not in position 1.

So now we know:
- R is present in the word, but not in positions 1 or 4.
- Therefore, R must be in position 2, 3, or 5 of the secret word.

Additionally, the following letters are not in the word: A, I, S, E, T, H, O, N.

We have eliminated 9 letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N. (Note: R is confirmed present.)

Now, we need to come up with a new 5-letter word that:
- Contains R (exactly, but possibly more, though we don't know) in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5.
- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.
- Includes new common letters to test.

Available letters: The English alphabet minus the eliminated ones.
Eliminated: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.
So remaining: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and R (which we must use).

We note that R is in the word, so our guess must include R in position 2, 3, or 5.

To maximize information, we should:
1. Pick a word with R in one of the untested positions: 2, 3, or 5 (since position 1 and 4 are ruled out).
2. Use common remaining letters to cover more possibilities.

Common letters from the remaining set: L, U, D, M, P, C, etc.

We can try to form words:

Option: Put R in position 2: _ R _ _ _
We need to fill with 4 letters from the remaining set, avoiding the eliminated ones.

Example: ""URBAN"" -> but U, R, B, A, N -> A and N are eliminated. Not allowed.
Another: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids eliminated letters? 
- Check: C (ok), R (must), U (ok), M (ok), B (ok). 
But note: we haven't tried these letters. However, the word ""crumb"" is a valid English word.

But also: ""CRUMB"" has R in position 2? Let's see:
Position 1: C
Position 2: R
Position 3: U
Position 4: M
Position 5: B

Yes.

Option: Put R in position 3: _ _ R _ _
Example: ""LUMPY"" -> but no R. Need R.
""CLAMP"" -> C, L, A, M, P -> A is eliminated.
""PLUMB"" -> P, L, U, M, B -> no R.
We need a word with R in position 3: _ _ R _ _

Example: ""BERRY"" -> B, E, R, R, Y -> E is eliminated.
""FERRY"" -> F, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated.
""PURGE"" -> P, U, R, G, E -> E eliminated.

So hard to find words without the eliminated vowels. 

Another: ""MYRRH"" -> M, Y, R, R, H -> H is eliminated (from the feedback of thorn: H was x).
H is out.

""BARMY"" -> B, A, R, M, Y -> A eliminated.

Try: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> 
Positions: 1:M, 2:U, 3:R, 4:K, 5:Y
Eliminated letters: avoids A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N? Yes. So it's valid.

But note: does it have R? Yes, in position 3.

Option: Put R in position 5: _ _ _ _ R
Example: ""LUCRE"" -> L, U, C, R, E -> E eliminated.
""VAPOR"" -> V, A, P, O, R -> A and O eliminated.
""RUMOR"" -> R, U, M, O, R -> O eliminated? And R in position 1 and 5? But position 1 is already known to be not R, so position 1 must be a different letter. However, ""rumor"" starts with R, which is not allowed. So we avoid words starting with R.

Another: ""HUMOR"" -> H, U, M, O, R -> H and O eliminated.
""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> T and O eliminated.

So position 5 is tricky because many words end with R and use common vowels that are eliminated.

Therefore, possible words we have so far:
- With R in position 2: ""CRUMB"", or possibly others.
- With R in position 3: ""MURKY""

We need to consider more words.

Another R in position 5: ""JUICY"" -> J, U, I, C, Y -> I eliminated.
But we need R: ""GUPPY"" -> No R.
""PUPPY"" -> No R.
""LYMPh"" -> Not allowed and has H which is eliminated.

Let me think of words ending with R and without the eliminated vowels: 
Words ending in R: using remaining vowels: U, and consonants.

Example: ""SUGAR"" -> S, U, G, A, R -> S and A eliminated.
""VAPOR"" -> eliminated.
""RADAR"" -> but starts with R and has A and R - multiple issues.

With U: ""ULCUR"" -> not a word.
With U: ""SUPER"" -> S eliminated and E.

Actually, it's hard. Maybe try ""AUDIO"" but doesn't end with R and has A.

Focus on R in position 2 or 3.

We have ""CRUMB"" (R in position 2) and ""MURKY"" (R in position 3).

""CRUMB"": letters C, R, U, M, B
""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y

Both avoid eliminated letters.

We want to choose one that tests more common letters? The remaining common letters: among the available set, common consonants: L, C, D, M, P, U, F, etc.

But note: U is a vowel and we haven't tested it, so it might be present.

Also, we need to consider that there might be two R's? But we don't know, so we should focus on single R for now.

Two candidates: 
- ""CRUMB""
- ""MURKY""

Which one gives more information? 
""CRUMB"" has C, U, M, B and R (which we know). 
""MURKY"" has M, U, R, K, Y.

Both test U and M (common). ""CRUMB"" tests C and B; ""MURKY"" tests K and Y.

C is more common than K or Y, so ""CRUMB"" might be slightly better.

But we don't know. Another word: ""CURVY""? C, U, R, V, Y -> R is in position 3? 
C in position 1, U in 2, R in 3, V in 4, Y in 5. 
Avoids eliminated letters? Yes.

So we have three options:
- ""CRUMB"" (R in 2nd): C, R, U, M, B
- ""CURVY"" (R in 3rd): C, U, R, V, Y
- ""MURKY"" (R in 3rd): M, U, R, K, Y

Another possibility: ""DRAFT"" -> D, R, A, F, T -> A and T eliminated.
Not good.

""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W?, L -> O eliminated? O is eliminated.

We must avoid O so any word containing O is invalid.

Now, ""CRUMB"", ""CURVY"", ""MURKY"". 

But ""CURVY"" uses V and Y, which are less common. ""CRUMB"" uses M and B. 

Alternatively, ""RUGBY""? R, U, G, B, Y -> 
Positions: 1:R -> but we know R cannot be in position 1! So if we start a word with R, it's invalid for position.

""RUGBY"" has R in position 1 -> not allowed. So must avoid.

Therefore, we must not put R in position 1.

Now, among the above, I think ""CRUMB"" is valid and tests more common consonants.

But let's consider ""CURLY"": C, U, R, L, Y -> R in position 3? 
C, U, R, L, Y: positions 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:L, 5:Y. 
Avoids eliminated? Yes.

So another candidate: ""CURLY"": tests C, U, R, L, Y.

L is a common consonant. 

Similarly, ""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> but we can put B at position 1 and R at position 3.

We have several options.

We need to pick one. Let's list:

1. ""CRUMB"" - R in position 2: C, R, U, M, B -> letters: C, R, U, M, B
2. ""CURLY"" - R in position 3: C, U, R, L, Y -> letters: C, U, R, L, Y
3. ""MURKY"" - R in position 3: M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M, U, R, K, Y
4. ""CURVY"" - R in position 3: C, U, R, V, Y -> letters: C, U, R, V, Y

We should avoid starting with R or having R in position 4? We know R cannot be in positions 1 or 4.

To test the position of R, we might pick one choice. For example, if we pick R in position 2, we can rule it out if wrong.

I think ""CURLY"" is a good choice because L is a common letter and we haven't tested it. Also, Y is sometimes a vowel.

But we also have to think: we have eliminated vowels A, E, I, O. So the word must have vowels: U, or Y (as in sky), or possibly other? But the secret word must have at least one vowel.

The remaining vowels are U, and sometimes Y (but Y can be consonant too). So we need to test U and/or Y.

Most words will need a vowel, so U is a good candidate.

Therefore, ""CURLY"" covers U and Y.

Also, common consonants C and L.

So I'll go with ""CURLY"".

But to decide between positions: R in position 3. We haven't tested position 3 before? 
- In guess 1, R was in position 1.
- In guess 2, R was in position 4.
- Now we are testing position 3.

So we are systematically checking positions.

If R is not in position 3, then it must be position 2 or 5? Position 5 we haven't tried.

But we can do that later.

So guess: ""curly"".

But note: we are also testing if L and Y are in the word.

Therefore, I choose ""curly"".

But let me double-check: 
- Secret word has R, not in pos 1 or 4.
- We don't know if it has U, L, Y, C.
- Avoided all eliminated letters.

Yes.

So response: <guess>curly</guess>From the previous feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""raise""**: R is present but not in position 1; A, I, S, E are absent.
- **Guess 2: ""thorn""**: R is present but not in position 4; T, H, O, N are absent.

**Key Insights:**
- R must be in the secret word but **not in positions 1 or 4**, so it can only be in position 2, 3, or 5.
- Eliminated letters (absences): A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.
- Remaining available letters (besides R): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

**Strategy for Guess 3:**
- Include R in position 2, 3, or 5 to test its correct placement.
- Use common letters from the remaining pool to maximize information, avoiding eliminated letters.
- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters like L, U, C, and Y (as pseudovowel).
- Avoid positions tested for R before (position 1 and 4 are ruled out).

**Selection:**
Chose ""**curly**"" because:
- R is in position 3 (untested position).
- Includes new common letters: C, U (vowel), L, Y (vowel substitute).
- Avoids all eliminated letters (A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N).
- Tests U and Y, crucial given the absence of other vowels.
- Provides broad coverage: if U or Y appears, it narrows vowel options; if not, more consonants are ruled out.

Meaning: R is in the word but not in position 1; A, I, S, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""thorn"" -> T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
Meaning: T, H, O, N are not in the word; R is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 3: ""curly"" -> C(✓) U(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
Meaning: 
  - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).
  - U is in the word but not in position 2.
  - R is in the word but not in position 3.
  - L and Y are not in the word.

Now, let's consolidate what we know:

1. The secret word has the letter C in the first position. So the word starts with C.

2. The letter R is in the word, but we know it is not in position 1 (from guess 1), not in position 4 (from guess 2), and not in position 3 (from guess 3). Therefore, R must be in position 2 or 5.

3. The letter U is in the word, but not in position 2 (from guess 3).

4. The following letters are not in the word: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y.

   So eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y.

5. We have used the letters: C, U, R (and we know they are in the word) and the eliminated ones.

6. The secret word has the form: C _ _ _ _

We know R must be in position 2 or 5. But note: if R is in position 2, then we have C R _ _ _

But in guess 3, we had ""curly"" which is C U R L Y. We got U as present but not in position 2. So if R is in position 2, then U cannot be in position 2 (which we already know) but must be somewhere else.

Also, we know U is in the word but not in position 2, so U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

But we have only 5 positions.

Now, we need to form a word that:
- Starts with C.
- Contains R (in position 2 or 5) and U (in position 3, 4, or 5).
- Avoids the eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and the letters we know: C, U, R.

But C is fixed at position 1, and R and U must be included.

We have two cases for R: position 2 or 5.

Case 1: R in position 2 -> word: C R _ _ _
Then U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

Case 2: R in position 5 -> word: C _ _ _ R
Then U must be in position 2, 3, or 4? But wait, position 2 is available for U? However, in guess 3, we had U in position 2 and it was present but not in that position. So U cannot be in position 2. Therefore, in this case, U must be in position 3 or 4.

But note: we also have to fill the remaining positions with letters from the available set.

We need to choose a word that tests these possibilities and uses new letters to gain information.

We have 6 guesses total, and we are on guess 4.

We can try to resolve the position of R and U.

Let's list possible words.

First, Case 1: C R _ _ _

We need to put U in one of the last three positions and fill the others with available letters.

For example:
- Position 3: U -> then we have C R U _ _
  We need two more letters, avoiding eliminated ones. And the word must be valid.
  Example: ""CRUMB"" -> but M and B are available? Yes, but we have U in position 3. But ""crumb"" is C R U M B -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:U, 4:M, 5:B.
  But we know from guess 3 that U is present but not in position 2, which is satisfied. And we are putting U in position 3.

  However, we haven't tested M and B. So it's a candidate.

  But note: we also have to consider that U might not be in position 3? We are testing it.

  Alternatively, we could put U in position 4: C R _ U _
  Example: ""CRWTH"" -> but W and H? H is eliminated. Not allowed.
  ""CRUMP"" -> C, R, U, M, P -> U in position 3? No, if U is in position 4: then it would be C R ? U ? -> for example, ""CRUMP"" has U in position 3? C(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5). So that's U in position 3.

  To have U in position 4: we need a word like C R ? U ? 
  Example: ""CRUSY"" -> but S and Y eliminated.
  ""CRUFT"" -> F and T? T is eliminated.

  Another: ""CRUDY"" -> D and Y? Y eliminated.

  It's hard to find words with U in position 4 for this pattern.

  Similarly, U in position 5: C R _ _ U
  Example: ""CRUSY"" -> again, S and Y eliminated.
  ""CRUMU"" -> not a word.

  So perhaps the only common word for case 1 is with U in position 3: like ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".

Now, Case 2: R in position 5 -> C _ _ _ R

Then U must be in position 3 or 4 (since not 2).

If U in position 3: C _ U _ R
Example: ""CURRY"" -> but R repeated? And Y? Also, we have R in position 5 and also in position 4? ""CURRY"" is C U R R Y -> so R in position 3 and 4? But we are putting R only in position 5? Actually, the word would be: position 1:C, 2:?, 3:U, 4:?, 5:R.

But we need to fill position 2 and 4.

Example: ""CURVY"" -> but V and Y? Y eliminated.
""BURQA"" -> B, U, R, Q, A -> A eliminated.
""JUROR"" -> J, U, R, O, R -> O eliminated and R repeated.

Another: ""CURED"" -> E and D? E eliminated.

It's difficult.

If U in position 4: C _ _ U R
Example: ""CUPUR"" -> not a word.
""CAPER"" -> A and E eliminated.
""COVER"" -> O and E eliminated.

""CAULK"" -> A and L eliminated.

So case 2 seems harder to find words.

But we have a candidate for case 1: ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".

But note: we also have to consider that the word might have more than one U or R? But we don't have evidence.

Another word for case 1: ""CRUFT"" -> but T eliminated.

""CRUDY"" -> Y eliminated.

So ""CRUMB"" and ""CRUMP"" are the main candidates.

But we also have the possibility that U is not in position 3? In case 1, we have to put U in 3,4, or5, but we found that 4 and5 are hard. So maybe U is in position 3.

But we don't know. We need to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests R in position 5 and U in position 3 or4.

But we found it hard to form words. Let me try again.

For case 2, R in position 5: C _ _ _ R

With U in position 3: C _ U _ R

Available letters for position 2 and 4: from B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Example: ""CUMAR"" -> not a word.
""KUDZU"" -> K, U, D, Z, U -> but we need R at the end? No, we have R at the end. ""KUDZU"" is not ending with R.

""CHUFA"" -> H and A eliminated.

""JUMAR"" -> J, U, M, A, R -> A eliminated.

""PUKER"" -> P, U, K, E, R -> E eliminated.

""MUJIK"" -> no R.

It's very hard.

With U in position 4: C _ _ U R

Example: ""CABER"" -> A and E eliminated.
""COWER"" -> O and E eliminated.
""CAVER"" -> A and E.
""COUPR"" -> not a word.

""CUPPER"" -> too long.

Perhaps ""CUBER"" -> C, U, B, E, R -> E eliminated.

I think case 2 is not promising because we cannot find common words.

Therefore, it's more likely that R is in position 2 and U in position 3.

So we can guess ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".

But we also have to consider that there might be other words.

Another possibility: what if the word has U in position 4 or 5? But we couldn't find words. So maybe we should go with ""CRUMB"".

But note: we have feedback that U is present but not in position 2. In ""CRUMB"", we put U in position 3, which is allowed.

Also, we are testing M and B.

But we have another constraint: we know R is in the word and must be in 2 or 5. In ""CRUMB"", R is in position 2.

So let's choose ""CRUMB"".

But wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""CRUMB"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tests R in position 5 to confirm or deny.

But we don't have a good word for that.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has R in position 5 and U in position 3, but we need to find one.

For example, ""CURER"" -> but E and R repeated? And E eliminated.

""DUVET"" -> no R and E.

I think we should go with ""CRUMB"".

But let's see the feedback we might get.

If we guess ""CRUMB"", and if the secret word is ""CRUMB"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on M and B.

But we are on guess 4, so we have two more guesses.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses more new letters to get more information.

For example, we know the first letter is C, and we need to test position 2 and 5 for R.

We can try a word that has R in position 5 and also tests other common letters.

But we don't know if U is in position 3,4, or5? We know U is present, so we must include U.

So we must include U and R.

So let's list all possible words that start with C, contain U and R, avoid eliminated letters, and have R in position 2 or 5.

First, R in position 2: then U in 3,4,5.

We have:
- U in 3: C R U ? ? 
  Words: ""CRUMB"", ""CRUMP"", ""CRUFT"" (T eliminated), ""CRUD"" (too short), ""CRUDS"" (S eliminated), ""CRUDY"" (Y eliminated). So only ""CRUMB"" and ""CRUMP"".

- U in 4: C R ? U ? 
  Words: ""CRWTH"" (W and H? H eliminated, and not common), ""CRUOR"" (O and R? O eliminated), ""CRUMP"" has U in 3, not 4. I can't find a common word.

- U in 5: C R ? ? U
  Words: ""CRUSY"" (S and Y eliminated), ""CRU"" (too short). No common words.

So only realistic is U in 3: ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".

Now, for R in position 5: C ? ? ? R, with U in 3 or 4.

- U in 3: C ? U ? R
  Words: ""CURRY"" (R repeated and Y? Also, we need to fill: if U in 3, then positions: 1:C, 2:?, 3:U, 4:?, 5:R. Example: ""CURAR"" (not common, and A), ""CURER"" (E), ""CURRS"" (S and R repeated). No good.

- U in 4: C ? ? U R
  Words: ""CUR"" (too short), ""CURVY"" (V and Y? Y eliminated), ""CURRY"" (U in 3? not 4). I can't find a word.

Therefore, the only feasible words are ""CRUMB"" and ""CRUMP"".

I think ""CRUMB"" is slightly more common? Or ""CRUMP"".

But we can choose either.

Let's pick ""CRUMB"".

But note: we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't have evidence.

So I'll go with ""CRUMB"".

But wait, in the feedback for guess 3, we have U as present but not in position 2. In ""CRUMB"", U is in position 3, which is fine.

Also, R is in position 2, which is a possible position.

So guess: ""crumb""

But let's write it in uppercase? The game uses uppercase? But in the response, we can write in lowercase and it will be converted? Or we should write in uppercase? The previous guesses were in lowercase in the response, but the feedback in uppercase? Actually, in the user message, the feedback is in uppercase for letters, but the guess words are in lowercase in the response.

So I'll write <guess>crumb</guess>

But note: we are not sure if ""crumb"" is the word, but it's a guess to get information.

If it's not, we get feedback on M and B.

But we have two more guesses.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't assume R in position 2, but tests both possibilities? But it's hard.

Another word: ""CURDY"" -> but Y eliminated.

I think ""CRUMB"" is the best bet.### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  
  - R is present but not in position 1 (R must be in position 2, 3, or 5).  
  - A, I, S, E are absent.  

- **Guess 2: ""thorn""**  
  - R is present but not in position 4 (narrowing R to position 2, 3, or 5).  
  - T, H, O, N are absent.  

- **Guess 3: ""curly""**  
  - C is correct and in position 1 (secret word starts with C).  
  - U is present but not in position 2 (U must be in position 3, 4, or 5).  
  - R is present but not in position 3 (narrowing R to position 2 or 5).  
  - L, Y are absent.  

### Consolidated Insights
1. **Secret word structure**: `C _ _ _ _` (C is fixed at position 1).  
2. **Confirmed present letters**:  
   - R (must be in position 2 or 5).  
   - U (must be in position 3, 4, or 5).  
3. **Absent letters**: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y (15 letters eliminated).  
4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and confirmed C, U, R).  
5. **Constraints**:  
   - R and U cannot share positions (R in 2/5, U in 3/4/5), so the word must accommodate both.  
   - Position 2 is open only to R (if R is there) or a new letter.  
   - No eliminated letters can be used.  

### Strategy for Guess 4
- **Goal**: Resolve R and U positions while testing new letters.  
  - R must be in position 2 or 5.  
  - U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Prioritize words with R in position 2 (untested position for R) and U in position 3 (common pattern).  
  - Use new high-frequency consonants (e.g., M, B) to maximize information.  
  - Avoid wasting letters; all guesses must include R and U.  
- **Word choice**: ""**crumb**"" fits perfectly:  
  - Starts with C (position 1 correct).  
  - R in position 2 (tests if R is here).  
  - U in position 3 (tests if U is here).  
  - M and B are new common letters (untested).  
  - Avoids all eliminated letters.  

If ""crumb"" is incorrect, feedback on M and B will further narrow possibilities (e.g., if M or B is present/absent). With 2 guesses left, this maintains flexibility.

We have tried R, A, I, S, E.

Then the word pattern: _ R _ _ _\n  We need to avoid A, I, S, E. So the first letter can be one of the unused consonants or vowels (but note: first letter is often a consonant).\n\n  Example: ""CRUST"" -> but we have to check if it avoids A, I, S, E? \n    C, R, U, S, T -> S is in the word, but we know S is not in the secret word. So we cannot use S.\n\n  We must avoid S, so we cannot use words containing S.\n\n  Another: ""PROUD"" -> P, R, O, U, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.

Yes.\n\nOption 4: Put R in the fifth position: _ _ _ _ R\n  Example: ""LATER"" -> but LATER has E and R, but E is not allowed. So we need to avoid E. \n  Instead: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R -> but A is not allowed. \n  Another: ""MINOR"" -> has I and A? No, but I is not allowed. \n  So let\'s try: ""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.\n\nWe want to cover as many new letters as possible. Also, note that we have 5 positions to fill and we want to test common letters.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: we have 21 consonants (excluding R, S) and 2 vowels (O, U) that we haven\'t tried? Actually, we have more vowels: O, U, and sometimes Y. But we also have to consider that the word must be valid.\n\nWe can also use Y as a vowel? For example, in words like ""DRYLY"" but that has repeated letters and we don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed? The rules don\'t say, but typically words can have repeated letters. However, in this feedback, we don\'t have any information about repeated letters. But since we are avoiding A, I, S, E, and we know R is in the word, we don\'t know if R appears more than once? But we only have one R so far.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""raise"" only showed one R and it was present (but in wrong position). If there were two R\'s, then the feedback would have shown two minuses or one correct and one minus? But in this case, we only have one R. So we don\'t know if there are multiple R\'s. We should consider that possibility, but for now, we assume at least one R.\n\nWe want to maximize information. So we should choose a word that has:\n  - R in a position that is not the first (so positions 2,3,4,5)\n  - Uses common letters that we haven\'t tried: for example, T, O, U, L, N, etc.\n\nCommon letters in English: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U ... but we have already ruled out A, I, S, E. So we are left with T, O, N, H, R (but R we know), D, L, U, etc.\n\nSo we should try to include T, O, N, H, D, L, U.\n\nBut we have only 5 letters. We must include R and avoid A, I, S, E.\n\nLet me try to form a word:\n\nOption: ""ROUTE"" -> but E is not allowed. \nOption: ""POUTY"" -> P, O, U, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And R? We must include R! This word doesn\'t have R. So we cannot use it.\n\nWe must include R.\n\nAnother option: ""TROUT"" -> T, R, O, U, T -> has T repeated? That\'s okay. But note: we have R in the second position. And avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.\n\nBut we are testing T, R, O, U. That\'s good.\n\nAnother: ""GROUT"" -> G, R, O, U, T -> same as above but with G instead of T at the start. But we haven\'t tried G.\n\nBut note: we want to test as many new letters as possible. ""TROUT"" uses T, R, O, U. We get to test T, O, U (and R we already know). But we are repeating T? Actually, two T\'s: so we are testing only 4 distinct letters: T, R, O, U.\n\nSimilarly, ""GROUT"" tests G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct letters? G, R, O, U, T -> yes, 5 distinct.\n\nSo ""GROUT"" might be better because it tests 5 new distinct letters (G, R, O, U, T) and we know R is included.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the secret word has G, O, U, T. But that\'s the point of guessing.\n\nAnother candidate: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the fourth position. And tests C, O, U, R, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""DOUBT"" -> D, O, U, B, T -> but no R. So we cannot use that.\n\nWe must have R.\n\nAnother: ""BROWN"" -> B, R, O, W, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. Tests B, R, O, W, N.\n\nBut we haven\'t tried B, O, W, N.\n\nWe can also consider: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. But has M and B.\n\nWe have many options. We should choose one that covers common letters and positions.\n\nBut note: we also want to cover the position of R. Since we know R is not in position 1, we can try to put R in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. We don\'t know which, so we might want to try a position that we haven\'t tested? Actually, in the first guess we tested position 1 for R and it was wrong. So we can try a different position.\n\nBut we don\'t have to fix the position of R in this guess? We can try any position as long as it\'s not position 1? Actually, we can even try position 1 again? But that would be wasteful because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting R in position 1.\n\nLet me list some words that have R and avoid A, I, S, E, and put R in positions 2,3,4,5:\n\n- Position 2: words like ""CRUST"" (but has S, not allowed), ""GRUNT"" (G, R, U, N, T -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""PRONG"" (P, R, O, N, G -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""TRUCK"" (T, R, U, C, K -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).\n\n- Position 3: ""CHARM"" (but has A, not allowed), ""BORNE"" (has E, not allowed), ""FORTY"" (F, O, R, T, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""HORDE"" (has E, not allowed), ""WORDY"" (W, O, R, D, Y -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).\n\n- Position 4: ""ABHOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""ADORE"" (has A and E, not allowed), ""FJORD"" (F, J, O, R, D -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes), ""THORN"" (T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).\n\n- Position 5: ""LATER"" (has E, not allowed), ""MANOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""RUMOR"" (R, U, M, O, R -> has R repeated? And we don\'t know if repeated letters are allowed. But the word is valid. However, we are using R twice. But we know R is in the word, so if the secret word has two R\'s, that\'s okay. But we are testing R at the end. Also, the first letter is R, which we know is not in the first position? Wait, we are putting R at the end and also at the beginning? That would be two R\'s. But we know the first position cannot be R, so if we put R in the first position again, that would be a waste. So we should avoid putting R in the first position.\n\n  Instead, for position 5: ""VAPOR"" (has A, not allowed), ""TUMOR"" (T, U, M, O, R -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes).\n\nNow, we want to choose a word that uses common letters and covers multiple positions.\n\nI think ""TROUT"" (with R in position 2) or ""FORTY"" (with R in position 3) or ""THORN"" (with R in position 4) or ""TUMOR"" (with R in position 5) are options.\n\nBut let\'s consider the distinct letters:\n\n- ""TROUT"": T, R, O, U, T -> letters: T, R, O, U (4 distinct, T repeated)\n- ""GROUT"": G, R, O, U, T -> 5 distinct: G, R, O, U, T\n- ""FORTY"": F, O, R, T, Y -> 5 distinct: F, O, R, T, Y\n- ""THORN"": T, H, O, R, N -> 5 distinct: T, H, O, R, N\n- ""TUMOR"": T, U, M, O, R -> 5 distinct: T, U, M, O, R\n\nWe want to cover more common consonants. The letters T, O, R are common. Then H, N, U, M, F, G, Y are less common.\n\nAmong these, ""THORN"" covers T, H, O, R, N which are all common (H and N are common). Similarly, ""GROUT"" covers G, R, O, U, T (G and U are less common than H and N?).\n\nAccording to letter frequency in English words (5-letter words), the most common letters are: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have ruled out A, I, S, E. So the remaining common ones are R, O, T, N, L, C.\n\nWe haven\'t tried O, T, N, L, C.\n\nSo we should try to include O, T, N, L, C if possible.\n\nBut we must include R. So we can try to form a word with R, O, T, N, and one more.\n\nBut we have 5 letters. So we can have R, O, T, N, and say L? But is there a word ""RONT L""? Not really.\n\nHow about ""CLORT""? Not a word.\n\nWe can try ""TORCH"": T, O, R, C, H -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes. And has R in the third position. And tests T, O, R, C, H.\n\nSimilarly, ""NORTH"": N, O, R, T, H -> same as above but with N instead of C.\n\n""THORN"" we already considered: T, H, O, R, N -> which is the same as NORTH but in different order? Actually, ""THORN"" is a word, and ""NORTH"" is also a word.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nI think ""THORN"" is a good candidate because:\n  - It has R in the fourth position (which we haven\'t tested before, since in the first guess R was in position 1).\n  - It uses common letters: T, H, O, R, N (all of which are in the top 12 most common letters in English, except H which is still common).\n  - It avoids A, I, S, E.\n\nAlternatively, ""TORCH"" is also good: T, O, R, C, H.\n\nBut we haven\'t tried C and H. Both are common.\n\nAnother option: ""COURT"" -> C, O, U, R, T -> but we haven\'t tried U. U is less common than O, T, N, etc.\n\nI think ""THORN"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut note: we are trying to find the position of R. By putting R in the fourth position, we are testing that specific position. If we get a minus for R, then we know it\'s not in the fourth position. If we get a check, then we know it is.\n\nSimilarly, we are testing T in the first position, H in the second, O in the third, N in the fifth.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""THORN"".\n\nBut wait, what about the possibility that the word has two R\'s? We are only putting one R. But that\'s okay because if there is another R, we might get a minus for one of the other letters? Actually, we are only testing one R. But if the secret word has two R\'s, then we might not get information about the second R. However, we can handle that in subsequent guesses.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word with two R\'s? But we don\'t know if there is a second R. And we don\'t have many words that avoid A, I, S, E and have two R\'s. For example, ""RURAL"" has A and is not allowed. ""PURER"" has E and is not allowed. ""MURKY"" has no R? M, U, R, K, Y -> only one R. So it\'s hard to find a word with two R\'s without the forbidden letters.\n\nSo we\'ll stick with one R.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""THORN"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  THORN: T, H, O, R, N -> avoids A, I, S, E? Yes.\n\nSo the guess is ""thorn"".\n\nWe\'ll see the feedback and then adjust accordingly.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""raise"":\n- R is in the secret word but not in position 1 (indicated by `-`).\n- A, I, S, and E are not in the secret word (indicated by `x`).\n\nFor the second guess:\n- The word must include R (since it\'s confirmed present), but R cannot be in position 1.\n- The word must exclude A, I, S, and E.\n- To maximize information, I chose a word with common unused letters (T, H, O, N) and placed R in a new position (position 4) to test its location.\n\nThe word ""thorn"" fits these criteria:\n- Contains R in position 4.\n- Uses new common letters (T, H, O, N).\n- Avoids forbidden letters (A, I, S, E).\n\n<guess>thorn</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: thorn -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nMeaning:\n- R is in the word but not in position 1.\n- A, I, S, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""thorn"" -> T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\nMeaning:\n- T, H, O, N are not in the word.\n- R is in the word but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 in this guess and got a minus).\n\nWe also know from Guess 1 that R is not in position 1.\n\nSo now we know:\n- R is present in the word, but not in positions 1 or 4.\n- Therefore, R must be in position 2, 3, or 5 of the secret word.\n\nAdditionally, the following letters are not in the word: A, I, S, E, T, H, O, N.\n\nWe have eliminated 9 letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N. (Note: R is confirmed present.)\n\nNow, we need to come up with a new 5-letter word that:\n- Contains R (exactly, but possibly more, though we don\'t know) in one of the positions: 2, 3, or 5.\n- Does not contain any of the eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.\n- Includes new common letters to test.\n\nAvailable letters: The English alphabet minus the eliminated ones.\nEliminated: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.\nSo remaining: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z and R (which we must use).\n\nWe note that R is in the word, so our guess must include R in position 2, 3, or 5.\n\nTo maximize information, we should:\n1. Pick a word with R in one of the untested positions: 2, 3, or 5 (since position 1 and 4 are ruled out).\n2. Use common remaining letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nCommon letters from the remaining set: L, U, D, M, P, C, etc.\n\nWe can try to form words:\n\nOption: Put R in position 2: _ R _ _ _\nWe need to fill with 4 letters from the remaining set, avoiding the eliminated ones.\n\nExample: ""URBAN"" -> but U, R, B, A, N -> A and N are eliminated. Not allowed.\nAnother: ""CRUMB"" -> C, R, U, M, B -> avoids eliminated letters? \n- Check: C (ok), R (must), U (ok), M (ok), B (ok). \nBut note: we haven\'t tried these letters. However, the word ""crumb"" is a valid English word.\n\nBut also: ""CRUMB"" has R in position 2? Let\'s see:\nPosition 1: C\nPosition 2: R\nPosition 3: U\nPosition 4: M\nPosition 5: B\n\nYes.\n\nOption: Put R in position 3: _ _ R _ _\nExample: ""LUMPY"" -> but no R. Need R.\n""CLAMP"" -> C, L, A, M, P -> A is eliminated.\n""PLUMB"" -> P, L, U, M, B -> no R.\nWe need a word with R in position 3: _ _ R _ _\n\nExample: ""BERRY"" -> B, E, R, R, Y -> E is eliminated.\n""FERRY"" -> F, E, R, R, Y -> E eliminated.\n""PURGE"" -> P, U, R, G, E -> E eliminated.\n\nSo hard to find words without the eliminated vowels. \n\nAnother: ""MYRRH"" -> M, Y, R, R, H -> H is eliminated (from the feedback of thorn: H was x).\nH is out.\n\n""BARMY"" -> B, A, R, M, Y -> A eliminated.\n\nTry: ""MURKY"" -> M, U, R, K, Y -> \nPositions: 1:M, 2:U, 3:R, 4:K, 5:Y\nEliminated letters: avoids A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N? Yes. So it\'s valid.\n\nBut note: does it have R? Yes, in position 3.\n\nOption: Put R in position 5: _ _ _ _ R\nExample: ""LUCRE"" -> L, U, C, R, E -> E eliminated.\n""VAPOR"" -> V, A, P, O, R -> A and O eliminated.\n""RUMOR"" -> R, U, M, O, R -> O eliminated? And R in position 1 and 5? But position 1 is already known to be not R, so position 1 must be a different letter. However, ""rumor"" starts with R, which is not allowed. So we avoid words starting with R.\n\nAnother: ""HUMOR"" -> H, U, M, O, R -> H and O eliminated.\n""TUMOR"" -> T, U, M, O, R -> T and O eliminated.\n\nSo position 5 is tricky because many words end with R and use common vowels that are eliminated.\n\nTherefore, possible words we have so far:\n- With R in position 2: ""CRUMB"", or possibly others.\n- With R in position 3: ""MURKY""\n\nWe need to consider more words.\n\nAnother R in position 5: ""JUICY"" -> J, U, I, C, Y -> I eliminated.\nBut we need R: ""GUPPY"" -> No R.\n""PUPPY"" -> No R.\n""LYMPh"" -> Not allowed and has H which is eliminated.\n\nLet me think of words ending with R and without the eliminated vowels: \nWords ending in R: using remaining vowels: U, and consonants.\n\nExample: ""SUGAR"" -> S, U, G, A, R -> S and A eliminated.\n""VAPOR"" -> eliminated.\n""RADAR"" -> but starts with R and has A and R - multiple issues.\n\nWith U: ""ULCUR"" -> not a word.\nWith U: ""SUPER"" -> S eliminated and E.\n\nActually, it\'s hard. Maybe try ""AUDIO"" but doesn\'t end with R and has A.\n\nFocus on R in position 2 or 3.\n\nWe have ""CRUMB"" (R in position 2) and ""MURKY"" (R in position 3).\n\n""CRUMB"": letters C, R, U, M, B\n""MURKY"": M, U, R, K, Y\n\nBoth avoid eliminated letters.\n\nWe want to choose one that tests more common letters? The remaining common letters: among the available set, common consonants: L, C, D, M, P, U, F, etc.\n\nBut note: U is a vowel and we haven\'t tested it, so it might be present.\n\nAlso, we need to consider that there might be two R\'s? But we don\'t know, so we should focus on single R for now.\n\nTwo candidates: \n- ""CRUMB""\n- ""MURKY""\n\nWhich one gives more information? \n""CRUMB"" has C, U, M, B and R (which we know). \n""MURKY"" has M, U, R, K, Y.\n\nBoth test U and M (common). ""CRUMB"" tests C and B; ""MURKY"" tests K and Y.\n\nC is more common than K or Y, so ""CRUMB"" might be slightly better.\n\nBut we don\'t know. Another word: ""CURVY""? C, U, R, V, Y -> R is in position 3? \nC in position 1, U in 2, R in 3, V in 4, Y in 5. \nAvoids eliminated letters? Yes.\n\nSo we have three options:\n- ""CRUMB"" (R in 2nd): C, R, U, M, B\n- ""CURVY"" (R in 3rd): C, U, R, V, Y\n- ""MURKY"" (R in 3rd): M, U, R, K, Y\n\nAnother possibility: ""DRAFT"" -> D, R, A, F, T -> A and T eliminated.\nNot good.\n\n""PROWL"" -> P, R, O, W?, L -> O eliminated? O is eliminated.\n\nWe must avoid O so any word containing O is invalid.\n\nNow, ""CRUMB"", ""CURVY"", ""MURKY"". \n\nBut ""CURVY"" uses V and Y, which are less common. ""CRUMB"" uses M and B. \n\nAlternatively, ""RUGBY""? R, U, G, B, Y -> \nPositions: 1:R -> but we know R cannot be in position 1! So if we start a word with R, it\'s invalid for position.\n\n""RUGBY"" has R in position 1 -> not allowed. So must avoid.\n\nTherefore, we must not put R in position 1.\n\nNow, among the above, I think ""CRUMB"" is valid and tests more common consonants.\n\nBut let\'s consider ""CURLY"": C, U, R, L, Y -> R in position 3? \nC, U, R, L, Y: positions 1:C, 2:U, 3:R, 4:L, 5:Y. \nAvoids eliminated? Yes.\n\nSo another candidate: ""CURLY"": tests C, U, R, L, Y.\n\nL is a common consonant. \n\nSimilarly, ""BURLY"": B, U, R, L, Y -> but we can put B at position 1 and R at position 3.\n\nWe have several options.\n\nWe need to pick one. Let\'s list:\n\n1. ""CRUMB"" - R in position 2: C, R, U, M, B -> letters: C, R, U, M, B\n2. ""CURLY"" - R in position 3: C, U, R, L, Y -> letters: C, U, R, L, Y\n3. ""MURKY"" - R in position 3: M, U, R, K, Y -> letters: M, U, R, K, Y\n4. ""CURVY"" - R in position 3: C, U, R, V, Y -> letters: C, U, R, V, Y\n\nWe should avoid starting with R or having R in position 4? We know R cannot be in positions 1 or 4.\n\nTo test the position of R, we might pick one choice. For example, if we pick R in position 2, we can rule it out if wrong.\n\nI think ""CURLY"" is a good choice because L is a common letter and we haven\'t tested it. Also, Y is sometimes a vowel.\n\nBut we also have to think: we have eliminated vowels A, E, I, O. So the word must have vowels: U, or Y (as in sky), or possibly other? But the secret word must have at least one vowel.\n\nThe remaining vowels are U, and sometimes Y (but Y can be consonant too). So we need to test U and/or Y.\n\nMost words will need a vowel, so U is a good candidate.\n\nTherefore, ""CURLY"" covers U and Y.\n\nAlso, common consonants C and L.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CURLY"".\n\nBut to decide between positions: R in position 3. We haven\'t tested position 3 before? \n- In guess 1, R was in position 1.\n- In guess 2, R was in position 4.\n- Now we are testing position 3.\n\nSo we are systematically checking positions.\n\nIf R is not in position 3, then it must be position 2 or 5? Position 5 we haven\'t tried.\n\nBut we can do that later.\n\nSo guess: ""curly"".\n\nBut note: we are also testing if L and Y are in the word.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""curly"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n- Secret word has R, not in pos 1 or 4.\n- We don\'t know if it has U, L, Y, C.\n- Avoided all eliminated letters.\n\nYes.\n\nSo response: <guess>curly</guess>From the previous feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""raise""**: R is present but not in position 1; A, I, S, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2: ""thorn""**: R is present but not in position 4; T, H, O, N are absent.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- R must be in the secret word but **not in positions 1 or 4**, so it can only be in position 2, 3, or 5.\n- Eliminated letters (absences): A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N.\n- Remaining available letters (besides R): B, C, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n**Strategy for Guess 3:**\n- Include R in position 2, 3, or 5 to test its correct placement.\n- Use common letters from the remaining pool to maximize information, avoiding eliminated letters.\n- Prioritize words with high-frequency letters like L, U, C, and Y (as pseudovowel).\n- Avoid positions tested for R before (position 1 and 4 are ruled out).\n\n**Selection:**\nChose ""**curly**"" because:\n- R is in position 3 (untested position).\n- Includes new common letters: C, U (vowel), L, Y (vowel substitute).\n- Avoids all eliminated letters (A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N).\n- Tests U and Y, crucial given the absence of other vowels.\n- Provides broad coverage: if U or Y appears, it narrows vowel options; if not, more consonants are ruled out.\n\n<guess>curly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: thorn -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\nGuess 3: curly -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) U(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)\nMeaning: R is in the word but not in position 1; A, I, S, E are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: ""thorn"" -> T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)\nMeaning: T, H, O, N are not in the word; R is in the word but not in position 4.\n\nGuess 3: ""curly"" -> C(✓) U(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)\nMeaning: \n  - C is in the word and in the correct position (position 1).\n  - U is in the word but not in position 2.\n  - R is in the word but not in position 3.\n  - L and Y are not in the word.\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate what we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the letter C in the first position. So the word starts with C.\n\n2. The letter R is in the word, but we know it is not in position 1 (from guess 1), not in position 4 (from guess 2), and not in position 3 (from guess 3). Therefore, R must be in position 2 or 5.\n\n3. The letter U is in the word, but not in position 2 (from guess 3).\n\n4. The following letters are not in the word: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y.\n\n   So eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y.\n\n5. We have used the letters: C, U, R (and we know they are in the word) and the eliminated ones.\n\n6. The secret word has the form: C _ _ _ _\n\nWe know R must be in position 2 or 5. But note: if R is in position 2, then we have C R _ _ _\n\nBut in guess 3, we had ""curly"" which is C U R L Y. We got U as present but not in position 2. So if R is in position 2, then U cannot be in position 2 (which we already know) but must be somewhere else.\n\nAlso, we know U is in the word but not in position 2, so U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nBut we have only 5 positions.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that:\n- Starts with C.\n- Contains R (in position 2 or 5) and U (in position 3, 4, or 5).\n- Avoids the eliminated letters: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z and the letters we know: C, U, R.\n\nBut C is fixed at position 1, and R and U must be included.\n\nWe have two cases for R: position 2 or 5.\n\nCase 1: R in position 2 -> word: C R _ _ _\nThen U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.\n\nCase 2: R in position 5 -> word: C _ _ _ R\nThen U must be in position 2, 3, or 4? But wait, position 2 is available for U? However, in guess 3, we had U in position 2 and it was present but not in that position. So U cannot be in position 2. Therefore, in this case, U must be in position 3 or 4.\n\nBut note: we also have to fill the remaining positions with letters from the available set.\n\nWe need to choose a word that tests these possibilities and uses new letters to gain information.\n\nWe have 6 guesses total, and we are on guess 4.\n\nWe can try to resolve the position of R and U.\n\nLet\'s list possible words.\n\nFirst, Case 1: C R _ _ _\n\nWe need to put U in one of the last three positions and fill the others with available letters.\n\nFor example:\n- Position 3: U -> then we have C R U _ _\n  We need two more letters, avoiding eliminated ones. And the word must be valid.\n  Example: ""CRUMB"" -> but M and B are available? Yes, but we have U in position 3. But ""crumb"" is C R U M B -> positions: 1:C, 2:R, 3:U, 4:M, 5:B.\n  But we know from guess 3 that U is present but not in position 2, which is satisfied. And we are putting U in position 3.\n\n  However, we haven\'t tested M and B. So it\'s a candidate.\n\n  But note: we also have to consider that U might not be in position 3? We are testing it.\n\n  Alternatively, we could put U in position 4: C R _ U _\n  Example: ""CRWTH"" -> but W and H? H is eliminated. Not allowed.\n  ""CRUMP"" -> C, R, U, M, P -> U in position 3? No, if U is in position 4: then it would be C R ? U ? -> for example, ""CRUMP"" has U in position 3? C(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), P(5). So that\'s U in position 3.\n\n  To have U in position 4: we need a word like C R ? U ? \n  Example: ""CRUSY"" -> but S and Y eliminated.\n  ""CRUFT"" -> F and T? T is eliminated.\n\n  Another: ""CRUDY"" -> D and Y? Y eliminated.\n\n  It\'s hard to find words with U in position 4 for this pattern.\n\n  Similarly, U in position 5: C R _ _ U\n  Example: ""CRUSY"" -> again, S and Y eliminated.\n  ""CRUMU"" -> not a word.\n\n  So perhaps the only common word for case 1 is with U in position 3: like ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".\n\nNow, Case 2: R in position 5 -> C _ _ _ R\n\nThen U must be in position 3 or 4 (since not 2).\n\nIf U in position 3: C _ U _ R\nExample: ""CURRY"" -> but R repeated? And Y? Also, we have R in position 5 and also in position 4? ""CURRY"" is C U R R Y -> so R in position 3 and 4? But we are putting R only in position 5? Actually, the word would be: position 1:C, 2:?, 3:U, 4:?, 5:R.\n\nBut we need to fill position 2 and 4.\n\nExample: ""CURVY"" -> but V and Y? Y eliminated.\n""BURQA"" -> B, U, R, Q, A -> A eliminated.\n""JUROR"" -> J, U, R, O, R -> O eliminated and R repeated.\n\nAnother: ""CURED"" -> E and D? E eliminated.\n\nIt\'s difficult.\n\nIf U in position 4: C _ _ U R\nExample: ""CUPUR"" -> not a word.\n""CAPER"" -> A and E eliminated.\n""COVER"" -> O and E eliminated.\n\n""CAULK"" -> A and L eliminated.\n\nSo case 2 seems harder to find words.\n\nBut we have a candidate for case 1: ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the word might have more than one U or R? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nAnother word for case 1: ""CRUFT"" -> but T eliminated.\n\n""CRUDY"" -> Y eliminated.\n\nSo ""CRUMB"" and ""CRUMP"" are the main candidates.\n\nBut we also have the possibility that U is not in position 3? In case 1, we have to put U in 3,4, or5, but we found that 4 and5 are hard. So maybe U is in position 3.\n\nBut we don\'t know. We need to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests R in position 5 and U in position 3 or4.\n\nBut we found it hard to form words. Let me try again.\n\nFor case 2, R in position 5: C _ _ _ R\n\nWith U in position 3: C _ U _ R\n\nAvailable letters for position 2 and 4: from B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nExample: ""CUMAR"" -> not a word.\n""KUDZU"" -> K, U, D, Z, U -> but we need R at the end? No, we have R at the end. ""KUDZU"" is not ending with R.\n\n""CHUFA"" -> H and A eliminated.\n\n""JUMAR"" -> J, U, M, A, R -> A eliminated.\n\n""PUKER"" -> P, U, K, E, R -> E eliminated.\n\n""MUJIK"" -> no R.\n\nIt\'s very hard.\n\nWith U in position 4: C _ _ U R\n\nExample: ""CABER"" -> A and E eliminated.\n""COWER"" -> O and E eliminated.\n""CAVER"" -> A and E.\n""COUPR"" -> not a word.\n\n""CUPPER"" -> too long.\n\nPerhaps ""CUBER"" -> C, U, B, E, R -> E eliminated.\n\nI think case 2 is not promising because we cannot find common words.\n\nTherefore, it\'s more likely that R is in position 2 and U in position 3.\n\nSo we can guess ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".\n\nBut we also have to consider that there might be other words.\n\nAnother possibility: what if the word has U in position 4 or 5? But we couldn\'t find words. So maybe we should go with ""CRUMB"".\n\nBut note: we have feedback that U is present but not in position 2. In ""CRUMB"", we put U in position 3, which is allowed.\n\nAlso, we are testing M and B.\n\nBut we have another constraint: we know R is in the word and must be in 2 or 5. In ""CRUMB"", R is in position 2.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""CRUMB"".\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""CRUMB"" is a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tests R in position 5 to confirm or deny.\n\nBut we don\'t have a good word for that.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has R in position 5 and U in position 3, but we need to find one.\n\nFor example, ""CURER"" -> but E and R repeated? And E eliminated.\n\n""DUVET"" -> no R and E.\n\nI think we should go with ""CRUMB"".\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nIf we guess ""CRUMB"", and if the secret word is ""CRUMB"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on M and B.\n\nBut we are on guess 4, so we have two more guesses.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that uses more new letters to get more information.\n\nFor example, we know the first letter is C, and we need to test position 2 and 5 for R.\n\nWe can try a word that has R in position 5 and also tests other common letters.\n\nBut we don\'t know if U is in position 3,4, or5? We know U is present, so we must include U.\n\nSo we must include U and R.\n\nSo let\'s list all possible words that start with C, contain U and R, avoid eliminated letters, and have R in position 2 or 5.\n\nFirst, R in position 2: then U in 3,4,5.\n\nWe have:\n- U in 3: C R U ? ? \n  Words: ""CRUMB"", ""CRUMP"", ""CRUFT"" (T eliminated), ""CRUD"" (too short), ""CRUDS"" (S eliminated), ""CRUDY"" (Y eliminated). So only ""CRUMB"" and ""CRUMP"".\n\n- U in 4: C R ? U ? \n  Words: ""CRWTH"" (W and H? H eliminated, and not common), ""CRUOR"" (O and R? O eliminated), ""CRUMP"" has U in 3, not 4. I can\'t find a common word.\n\n- U in 5: C R ? ? U\n  Words: ""CRUSY"" (S and Y eliminated), ""CRU"" (too short). No common words.\n\nSo only realistic is U in 3: ""CRUMB"" or ""CRUMP"".\n\nNow, for R in position 5: C ? ? ? R, with U in 3 or 4.\n\n- U in 3: C ? U ? R\n  Words: ""CURRY"" (R repeated and Y? Also, we need to fill: if U in 3, then positions: 1:C, 2:?, 3:U, 4:?, 5:R. Example: ""CURAR"" (not common, and A), ""CURER"" (E), ""CURRS"" (S and R repeated). No good.\n\n- U in 4: C ? ? U R\n  Words: ""CUR"" (too short), ""CURVY"" (V and Y? Y eliminated), ""CURRY"" (U in 3? not 4). I can\'t find a word.\n\nTherefore, the only feasible words are ""CRUMB"" and ""CRUMP"".\n\nI think ""CRUMB"" is slightly more common? Or ""CRUMP"".\n\nBut we can choose either.\n\nLet\'s pick ""CRUMB"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t have evidence.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""CRUMB"".\n\nBut wait, in the feedback for guess 3, we have U as present but not in position 2. In ""CRUMB"", U is in position 3, which is fine.\n\nAlso, R is in position 2, which is a possible position.\n\nSo guess: ""crumb""\n\nBut let\'s write it in uppercase? The game uses uppercase? But in the response, we can write in lowercase and it will be converted? Or we should write in uppercase? The previous guesses were in lowercase in the response, but the feedback in uppercase? Actually, in the user message, the feedback is in uppercase for letters, but the guess words are in lowercase in the response.\n\nSo I\'ll write <guess>crumb</guess>\n\nBut note: we are not sure if ""crumb"" is the word, but it\'s a guess to get information.\n\nIf it\'s not, we get feedback on M and B.\n\nBut we have two more guesses.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t assume R in position 2, but tests both possibilities? But it\'s hard.\n\nAnother word: ""CURDY"" -> but Y eliminated.\n\nI think ""CRUMB"" is the best bet.### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\n- **Guess 1: ""raise""**  \n  - R is present but not in position 1 (R must be in position 2, 3, or 5).  \n  - A, I, S, E are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""thorn""**  \n  - R is present but not in position 4 (narrowing R to position 2, 3, or 5).  \n  - T, H, O, N are absent.  \n\n- **Guess 3: ""curly""**  \n  - C is correct and in position 1 (secret word starts with C).  \n  - U is present but not in position 2 (U must be in position 3, 4, or 5).  \n  - R is present but not in position 3 (narrowing R to position 2 or 5).  \n  - L, Y are absent.  \n\n### Consolidated Insights\n1. **Secret word structure**: `C _ _ _ _` (C is fixed at position 1).  \n2. **Confirmed present letters**:  \n   - R (must be in position 2 or 5).  \n   - U (must be in position 3, 4, or 5).  \n3. **Absent letters**: A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y (15 letters eliminated).  \n4. **Available letters**: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (and confirmed C, U, R).  \n5. **Constraints**:  \n   - R and U cannot share positions (R in 2/5, U in 3/4/5), so the word must accommodate both.  \n   - Position 2 is open only to R (if R is there) or a new letter.  \n   - No eliminated letters can be used.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 4\n- **Goal**: Resolve R and U positions while testing new letters.  \n  - R must be in position 2 or 5.  \n  - U must be in position 3, 4, or 5.  \n- **Approach**:  \n  - Prioritize words with R in position 2 (untested position for R) and U in position 3 (common pattern).  \n  - Use new high-frequency consonants (e.g., M, B) to maximize information.  \n  - Avoid wasting letters; all guesses must include R and U.  \n- **Word choice**: ""**crumb**"" fits perfectly:  \n  - Starts with C (position 1 correct).  \n  - R in position 2 (tests if R is here).  \n  - U in position 3 (tests if U is here).  \n  - M and B are new common letters (untested).  \n  - Avoids all eliminated letters.  \n\nIf ""crumb"" is incorrect, feedback on M and B will further narrow possibilities (e.g., if M or B is present/absent).

We are given feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: ""raise"" -> R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Meaning: R is in the word but not in position 1; A, I, S, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""thorn"" -> T(x) H(x) O(x) R(-) N(x)
Meaning: T, H, O, N are absent; R is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 3: ""curly"" -> C(✓) U(-) R(-) L(x) Y(x)
Meaning: C is correct and in position 1; U is present but not in position 2; R is present but not in position 3; L and Y are absent.

Guess 4: ""crumb"" -> C(✓) R(✓) U(✓) M(✓) B(x)
Meaning: C is correct and in position 1; R is correct and in position 2; U is correct and in position 3; M is correct and in position 4; B is absent.

Now, let's consolidate:

- The secret word starts with C (position 1).
- Position 2 is R (since in ""crumb"", R is correct at position 2).
- Position 3 is U (since in ""crumb"", U is correct at position 3).
- Position 4 is M (since in ""crumb"", M is correct at position 4).
- B is absent.

Also, from previous feedback, we know:
- Position 1: C (fixed)
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: U (fixed)
- Position 4: M (fixed)
- Position 5: unknown, but must be a letter that is not B and not any of the eliminated letters.

Eliminated letters (absent): A, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y, B (from guess 4).

We also know that the secret word has the letters C, R, U, M, and one more letter in position 5.

The word so far is: C R U M ?

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""CRUM"" and the last letter is not B and not any of the eliminated letters.

Available letters: from the alphabet, remove the eliminated ones.

Eliminated: A, B, E, I, O, S, T, H, N, L, Y.

Remaining: C, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, R, U, V, W, X, Z.

But note: C, R, U, M are already used and fixed in positions 1-4. The last letter must be one of the remaining letters that hasn't been eliminated and is not B.

However, the last letter can be a letter that is already present? But we don't have any repeated letters so far. We don't know if repetition is allowed, but in this case, we have no indication of repetition.

But the feedback for ""crumb"" showed that B is absent, and the other letters are correct. So the secret word is ""CRUM"" + one letter.

Now, what are the possible words?

Common English words starting with ""CRUM"":

- CRUMB (but B is absent, so not this)
- CRUMP (P is available)
- CRUMB is out, so CRUMP is a candidate.

Other words?
- CRUMB is the most common, but B is absent.
- CRUMP: to make a crunching sound, or a type of bread.
- CRUMD? Not a word.
- CRUMF? Not a word.
- CRUMK? Not a word.
- CRUMP is one.

Also, CRUMZ? Not a word.

What about CRUMH? H is eliminated.

CRUMN? N is eliminated.

CRUML? L is eliminated.

CRUMY? Y is eliminated.

CRUMT? T is eliminated.

CRUME? E is eliminated.

CRUMO? O is eliminated.

CRUMA? A is eliminated.

CRUMS? S is eliminated.

So the only common word left is ""CRUMP"".

But is ""CRUMP"" a valid word? Yes, it is a word (e.g., ""crump"" as a verb meaning to thud or explode).

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""CRUMP"".

But we have to confirm. We have two guesses left, but we can guess it.

Alternatively, are there any other words?

Less common words:
- CRUMD? Not in common word lists.
- CRUMF? No.
- CRUMK? No.
- CRUMV? V is available, but ""crumv"" is not a word.
- CRUMW? ""Crumw"" not a word.
- CRUMX? No.
- CRUMZ? No.

So ""CRUMP"" is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""CRUMP"".

But note: in the feedback for guess 4, we have M as correct in position 4, and in ""CRUMP"", M is in position 4, so that matches.

Also, C, R, U are fixed.

So we can confidently guess ""CRUMP"".
