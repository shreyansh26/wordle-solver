We are making the first guess. There's no prior feedback to go on, so we want a word that can give us a lot of information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and be composed of distinct letters to maximize information.

 Let's pick a word that has some of the most common letters in English 5-letter words.
 Common initial guesses: ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it has R, A, I, S, E which are common letters.

 <guess>RAISE</guess>

<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, I need to choose a word that maximizes the information I get back. Ideally, I want a word with common letters and minimal repetition to cover more possibilities. Common starting words include ""CRATE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""RAISE,"" and ""ROAST."" 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" for the following reasons:
- It uses five distinct letters.
- Contains common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S).
- The letters R, S, and E are particularly prevalent in English words, so their feedback (whether present or absent) will help narrow down future guesses significantly.

This guess will tell me:
- If R, A, I, S, or E are in the word.
- If any are in the correct position (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x).

This sets up a strong foundation for the next guess.

We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, from this we know:
- E is definitely in the word and it is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E
- I is in the word, but not in the third position (since it was guessed in third but is misplaced). It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- R, A, and S are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we must choose a new guess that:
- Ends with E (since E is in the correct position).
- Contains the letter I, but not in position 3 (because the feedback for I was misplaced, so position 3 is wrong). Also, since I is present, we should include it in a different position.
- Does not contain R, A, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, having I in a position other than 3, and excluding R, A, S.

Possible positions for I: since it can't be in position 3, and we don't know where it is, we can try putting it in position 1, 2, or 4.

Also, we should aim to use common letters to get more feedback.

Let me think of words ending in E that contain I and exclude R, A, S.

Examples:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E -> words like ""INANE"", ""IMAGE"", but we don't know the other letters. But ""IMAGE"" has M and G which are new.
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E -> words like ""TITLE"", ""MINCE"", ""BIBLE"". But ""TITLE"" has T and L; ""MINCE"" has M, N, C; ""BIBLE"" repeats B and has L. We need to consider which letters are likely.

Since we have eliminated R, A, S, we can focus on other consonants or vowels.

But wait: we know E is at the end, so let's try to fix that and build.

Common words ending in E: like ALIVE, ABIDE, BRINE, CHIME, etc. But exclude R,A,S. So ALIVE has A (which is excluded) and L,I,V,E. But A is not allowed. Similarly, ABIDE has A.

What about ""OLIVE""? O,L,I,V,E. Does it have R,A,S? No. So OLIVE: positions: O in 1, L in 2, I in 3, V in 4, E in 5.

But wait, our feedback says I was misplaced in position 3. In ""RAISE"" we had I in position 3 and feedback said wrong position. So in the secret word, position 3 is not I. But in OLIVE, we are putting I in position 3 again? That would be the same position? It could be that the secret word doesn't have I in position 3, but we don't know if I is in another position. If I use OLIVE and put I in position 3 again, if in the actual word I is in position 3, we get conflicting feedback? But no: our feedback already says position 3 is wrong for I, so we must not put I in position 3 again.

Therefore, in OLIVE, if I put I in position 3, that would be trying the same position where we know it doesn't belong? No, the feedback said - for I, meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So wherever I is, it's not 3. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put I in position 3 and it gets -, it means still wrong position? But we already know it's not 3? Actually, we shouldn't put I in position 3 at all because we know it's incorrect for that position.

So for OLIVE, I is at position 3, which we know is wrong. Therefore, if we guess OLIVE, the feedback for I will be again '-' or possibly '✓'? But we don't know where I is. It's inefficient to try I in position 3 again when we know it's incorrect.

So a better strategy is to try I in a different position. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.

Therefore, words like:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E -> e.g., IMAGE (but has A, excluded), INKLE (I,N,K,L,E), but INKLE is a word? Yes. Or IVORY? But not ending with E? Ivory ends with Y, no.

IMAGE is invalid because it contains A, which is excluded.

INKLE: I, N, K, L, E. That is: I in pos1, N in pos2, K in pos3, L in pos4, E in pos5. This avoids R,A,S, and puts I in a new position? Previously I was in pos3, now pos1.

Similarly, position 2: _ I _ _ E -> e.g., TIGER, but TIGER has T,I,G,E,R? R is excluded. Words with I in second position: LIKE, FINE, WIPE, etc.

LIKE: L,I,K,E — but that's only 4 letters? LIKE has 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So ""OLIVE"" with I in position 3 is bad because of position.

Another position 4: _ _ _ I E -> that would be like .. I E at end. E is already at end. So words ending with IE? Like MOVIE, COTIE? But MOVIE is M,O,V,I,E — has I in position 4.

Also, we don't know about the other letters.

Possible words: 
- Ending in E, excluding R,A,S, have I in position 1,2, or 4.

Position 1: 
- INDEX: I,N,D,E,X? E at end, and positions: I(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), X(5)? Not ending with E? INDEX ends with X. We need last letter E.

Word must end in E. Any word with E at the 5th position.

So position 1: I? Start with I and end with E: e.g., IMAGE (invalid: A), ISLE? But ISLE ends with E? S is excluded. INLINE? Not 5 letters.

ICE? Too short.

Look for 5-letter words: IVOTE? Not a word.

IRENE? But has R (excluded, since R was x).

So IRENE invalid.

IGLOE? Not standard. 

IDE? Too short.

Perhaps ""INURE""? But has R? And U,N,E? INURE: I(1), N(2), U(3), R(4), E(5) — R is present? But R is excluded (feedback said x for R). So INURE has R, which is bad.

Another one: ""ILIKE""? Not a word.

Position 2: 
- LIGHT? Ends with T. Not E.

MIDGE? M,I,D,G,E — ends with E? No, MIDGE is M,I,D,G,E? That would be E at end? Positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. Yes, MIDGE is a word.

Similarly, ""TITLE"" ends with E? T,I,T,L,E — T at 5 would be E? Positions: 1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E — yes.

But TITLE has T appearing twice? Also, we don't care about repetition? It's allowed, but the secret word might have duplicate letters? Feedback doesn't distinguish that? From rules, the feedback is per letter in the word, but duplicate letters: the feedback will mark the occurrences correctly? For example, if secret has two Ts, and guess has one T, it might be inconsistent? But for now, let's assume no duplicates? Not necessarily.

Similarly, ""MINCE"" : M,I,N,C,E.

""BIBLE"" : B,I,B,L,E — B repeated.

Position 4: e.g., MOVIE: M,O,V,I,E — so I in position 4.

""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is a new position? Previously was position 3.

In our first guess, E was at position 5 and was correct. So for MOVIE, E is position 5? Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:I, 5:E — yes, E at 5.

Also, MOVIE does not have R, A, S? M,O,V,I,E — all new letters? Except E, which we know.

Moreover, I is included, so we can see if I is in position 4 or not.

So possible candidates:
- Position 1: hard to find words without R,A,S. INKLE? I(1),N(2),K(3),L(4),E(5) — yes, and INKLE is a word (a type of thread).
- Position 2: MIDGE (M,I,D,G,E), TITLE (T,I,T,L,E), ALIKE? But A is excluded? ALIKE has A? So no. LIEGE? L,I,E,G,E — but E is repeated? And in our guess, positions: 1:L,2:I,3:? — LIEGE is L,I,E,G,E — positions: 1:L,2:I,3:E,4:G,5:E. E at position 3 and 5? But E is in the word already at 5? In secret, we know E is only at 5? We don't know if E is elsewhere? For example, the secret could have multiple E's? So LIEGE might be okay, but it has E in position 3 as well? So if we guess LIEGE, position 3 E: if secret has E only at 5, position 3 E would be incorrect? And E at 5 is correct.

But let me check: we know E is at position 5. We don't know if E is elsewhere? It could be.

So LIEGE: has E at 3 and 5. Letter E: if secret has E only at 5, then position 3 E would be feedback '-' or 'x'? Since E is in the word but not at position 3, it should be '-'.

Similarly for other positions.

But to keep it simple, for position 2 candidates:
- MIDGE: M,I,D,G,E
- TITLE: T,I,T,L,E — repeated T? 
- MINCE: M,I,N,C,E — 
- BIBLE: B,I,B,L,E — repeated B

Position 4: MOVIE, or other words: OXIDE? But O,X,I,D,E — positions: 1:O,2:X,3:I,4:D,5:E? OXIDE has I in position 3? Not position 4. OXIDE: O(1),X(2),I(3),D(4),E(5) — that has I in position 3? We don't want that since we know I not in position 3.

MOVIE: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5) — I is in position 4.

So that's good.

Possible guesses: MIDGE, MINCE, MOVIE, INKLE, etc.

We also want to cover new letters. Since we have few known letters (only E and I), we should use more common new letters to test.

Let me prioritize: MOVIE uses M,O,V,I,E. I is known, E is confirmed. M,O,V are new.

MIDGE: M,I,D,G,E — similar.

INKLE: I,N,K,L,E — N,K,L new.

Considering letter frequencies: in remaining consonants, common ones include N, T, L, etc. But T is not excluded yet? From feedback, we only know R,A,S excluded. Letters we haven't used: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We want to include several of these.

Moreover, we want to put I in a new position to test where it is.

Currently available positions: 1,2,4 (since 3 is known wrong for I, and 5 is E).

So let's try position 4: MOVIE has I in position 4.

If we guess MOVIE, feedback:
- If I is actually in position 4, then it would be ✓ for I at position 4?
- If not, then - or x? Since we know I is in the word somewhere, if not position 4, it would be '-' and we know it must be in 1 or 2.

Perhaps that's efficient.

Similarly, MOVIE is a common word.

Another candidate: ""MOIRE""? But OIRE? MOIRE: M,O,I,R,E — has R? R is excluded? We cannot use R because feedback said R not in word. R was x, so MOIRE invalid because of R.

So MOVIE: valid? Moves in the game exist? Yes.

Similarly, ""PRIME""? But P,R,I,M,E — R excluded? No, R is not allowed.

So MOVIE seems fine.

Similarly, ""NINJA""? But not ends with E? And no E? Must end with E.

Another: ""WHINE""? W,H,I,N,E — positions: W1, H2, I3, N4, E5? But I is in position 3, which we should avoid? Since we don't want position 3.

If I want to test position 2: ""MINCE"" is M,I,N,C,E — I in position 2.

""MIDGE"": M,I,D,G,E — I in position 2.

Position 1: INKLE: I,N,K,L,E — I in position 1.

Let's choose between these.

Perhaps try to include consonants that are common: T, L, N, etc. but MOVIE doesn't have T or L.

To gather more information, perhaps a word with more new common letters.

Common consonants: T, N, L, O, U, etc.

So ""TILE"" is 4 letters.

""AMINE""? But A excluded.

""ELIDE""? E,L,I,D,E — ends with E? Positions: E1, L2, I3, D4, E5. But E in position 1? We don't know if E is elsewhere? And I in position 3? We shouldn't put I in position 3. Also, E at position 1: if secret E is only at 5, then position 1 E would be '-' (since E is present elsewhere) or 'x'? Not sure: if secret has only one E, and E is at 5, then position 1 E would be '-', meaning in the word but wrong position? But E is at 5 already? Feedback checks each letter independently? Actually, the Wordle rules: if you have duplicates in guess, the feedback accounts for duplicates in secret? For example, if secret has one E and guess has two E's, one might be yellow and one green? But in this case, if secret has only E at position 5, guess has E at position 1 and 5: position 5 is ✓, position 1 is '-' because E is present at position 5? But actually, that's correct? Yes.

In ELIDE, guess E at position 1: assuming secret has E at 5, not at 1, it would be '-' because E exists in the word elsewhere? Exactly like Wordle rules.

But we don't know if secret has E twice or not.

So ELIDE: positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E — but I is in position 3? Avoid position 3.

So ELIDE not good for that reason.

Instead, words like MOVIE (I at position 4) or MIDGE (I at position 2).

I think MOVIE is a good candidate.

Or perhaps ""BICE"" not 5 letters.

Another idea: ""CHIME"" — C,H,I,M,E — positions: C1, H2, I3, M4, E5. Again, I in position 3? Avoid.

""PHONE""? Ends with E? P,H,O,N,E — no I? We must contain I? Because we know I is in the word? From feedback, I is in the word (since '-' in RAISE), so our new guess must contain I? Not necessarily? But if we don't include I, we don't get information about it? That would be wasteful. Since we know I is present, we should include it to find its position.

So yes, the new guess must include I.

Therefore, MOVIE: has I at position 4.

Similarly, ""QUITE""? Q,U,I,T,E — positions: Q1,U2,I3,T4,E5 — I in position 3 again? Avoid.

""ABIDE"" has A, excluded.

So MOVIE seems a reasonable choice.

MIDGE is good too? MIDGE: positions:1:M,2:I,3:D,4:G,5:E.

I in position 2.

In terms of commonality, MOVIE might be better.

But let's decide: MOVIE.

So I'll guess MOVIE.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is not in the word (x).
- A is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in position E(✓).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must contain E in position 5.
- The letter I must be present, but not in position 3.
- The letters R, A, and S are absent and should be avoided in future guesses.
- Possible positions for I are 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect and position 5 is occupied by E).
- The next guess should end with E, include I in an untested position (1, 2, or 4), and exclude R, A, and S to gather more information about other letters.

For this guess, ""MOVIE"" is chosen because:
- It ends with E, maintaining the known correct position.
- It places I in position 4 (a new, untested position to potentially identify the correct position of I).
- It includes new common letters (M, O, V) to test their presence or absence.
- It avoids R, A, and S.

If I is in position 4 of the secret word, this will give a correct position (✓); if not, it might show as misplaced (-), narrowing I's possible locations to position 1 or 2. Feedback on M, O, and V will help constrain future guesses.

<guess>MOVIE</guess>",MOVIE,"We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, from this we know:
- E is definitely in the word and it is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E
- I is in the word, but not in the third position (since it was guessed in third but is misplaced). It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- R, A, and S are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we must choose a new guess that:
- Ends with E (since E is in the correct position).
- Contains the letter I, but not in position 3 (because the feedback for I was misplaced, so position 3 is wrong). Also, since I is present, we should include it in a different position.
- Does not contain R, A, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, having I in a position other than 3, and excluding R, A, S.

Possible positions for I: since it can't be in position 3, and we don't know where it is, we can try putting it in position 1, 2, or 4.

Also, we should aim to use common letters to get more feedback.

Let me think of words ending in E that contain I and exclude R, A, S.

Examples:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E -> words like ""INANE"", ""IMAGE"", but we don't know the other letters. But ""IMAGE"" has M and G which are new.
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E -> words like ""TITLE"", ""MINCE"", ""BIBLE"". But ""TITLE"" has T and L; ""MINCE"" has M, N, C; ""BIBLE"" repeats B and has L. We need to consider which letters are likely.

Since we have eliminated R, A, S, we can focus on other consonants or vowels.

But wait: we know E is at the end, so let's try to fix that and build.

Common words ending in E: like ALIVE, ABIDE, BRINE, CHIME, etc. But exclude R,A,S. So ALIVE has A (which is excluded) and L,I,V,E. But A is not allowed. Similarly, ABIDE has A.

What about ""OLIVE""? O,L,I,V,E. Does it have R,A,S? No. So OLIVE: positions: O in 1, L in 2, I in 3, V in 4, E in 5.

But wait, our feedback says I was misplaced in position 3. In ""RAISE"" we had I in position 3 and feedback said wrong position. So in the secret word, position 3 is not I. But in OLIVE, we are putting I in position 3 again? That would be the same position? It could be that the secret word doesn't have I in position 3, but we don't know if I is in another position. If I use OLIVE and put I in position 3 again, if in the actual word I is in position 3, we get conflicting feedback? But no: our feedback already says position 3 is wrong for I, so we must not put I in position 3 again.

Therefore, in OLIVE, if I put I in position 3, that would be trying the same position where we know it doesn't belong? No, the feedback said - for I, meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So wherever I is, it's not 3. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put I in position 3 and it gets -, it means still wrong position? But we already know it's not 3? Actually, we shouldn't put I in position 3 at all because we know it's incorrect for that position.

So for OLIVE, I is at position 3, which we know is wrong. Therefore, if we guess OLIVE, the feedback for I will be again '-' or possibly '✓'? But we don't know where I is. It's inefficient to try I in position 3 again when we know it's incorrect.

So a better strategy is to try I in a different position. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.

Therefore, words like:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E -> e.g., IMAGE (but has A, excluded), INKLE (I,N,K,L,E), but INKLE is a word? Yes. Or IVORY? But not ending with E? Ivory ends with Y, no.

IMAGE is invalid because it contains A, which is excluded.

INKLE: I, N, K, L, E. That is: I in pos1, N in pos2, K in pos3, L in pos4, E in pos5. This avoids R,A,S, and puts I in a new position? Previously I was in pos3, now pos1.

Similarly, position 2: _ I _ _ E -> e.g., TIGER, but TIGER has T,I,G,E,R? R is excluded. Words with I in second position: LIKE, FINE, WIPE, etc.

LIKE: L,I,K,E — but that's only 4 letters? LIKE has 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So ""OLIVE"" with I in position 3 is bad because of position.

Another position 4: _ _ _ I E -> that would be like .. I E at end. E is already at end. So words ending with IE? Like MOVIE, COTIE? But MOVIE is M,O,V,I,E — has I in position 4.

Also, we don't know about the other letters.

Possible words: 
- Ending in E, excluding R,A,S, have I in position 1,2, or 4.

Position 1: 
- INDEX: I,N,D,E,X? E at end, and positions: I(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), X(5)? Not ending with E? INDEX ends with X. We need last letter E.

Word must end in E. Any word with E at the 5th position.

So position 1: I? Start with I and end with E: e.g., IMAGE (invalid: A), ISLE? But ISLE ends with E? S is excluded. INLINE? Not 5 letters.

ICE? Too short.

Look for 5-letter words: IVOTE? Not a word.

IRENE? But has R (excluded, since R was x).

So IRENE invalid.

IGLOE? Not standard. 

IDE? Too short.

Perhaps ""INURE""? But has R? And U,N,E? INURE: I(1), N(2), U(3), R(4), E(5) — R is present? But R is excluded (feedback said x for R). So INURE has R, which is bad.

Another one: ""ILIKE""? Not a word.

Position 2: 
- LIGHT? Ends with T. Not E.

MIDGE? M,I,D,G,E — ends with E? No, MIDGE is M,I,D,G,E? That would be E at end? Positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. Yes, MIDGE is a word.

Similarly, ""TITLE"" ends with E? T,I,T,L,E — T at 5 would be E? Positions: 1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E — yes.

But TITLE has T appearing twice? Also, we don't care about repetition? It's allowed, but the secret word might have duplicate letters? Feedback doesn't distinguish that? From rules, the feedback is per letter in the word, but duplicate letters: the feedback will mark the occurrences correctly? For example, if secret has two Ts, and guess has one T, it might be inconsistent? But for now, let's assume no duplicates? Not necessarily.

Similarly, ""MINCE"" : M,I,N,C,E.

""BIBLE"" : B,I,B,L,E — B repeated.

Position 4: e.g., MOVIE: M,O,V,I,E — so I in position 4.

""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is a new position? Previously was position 3.

In our first guess, E was at position 5 and was correct. So for MOVIE, E is position 5? Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:I, 5:E — yes, E at 5.

Also, MOVIE does not have R, A, S? M,O,V,I,E — all new letters? Except E, which we know.

Moreover, I is included, so we can see if I is in position 4 or not.

So possible candidates:
- Position 1: hard to find words without R,A,S. INKLE? I(1),N(2),K(3),L(4),E(5) — yes, and INKLE is a word (a type of thread).
- Position 2: MIDGE (M,I,D,G,E), TITLE (T,I,T,L,E), ALIKE? But A is excluded? ALIKE has A? So no. LIEGE? L,I,E,G,E — but E is repeated? And in our guess, positions: 1:L,2:I,3:? — LIEGE is L,I,E,G,E — positions: 1:L,2:I,3:E,4:G,5:E. E at position 3 and 5? But E is in the word already at 5? In secret, we know E is only at 5? We don't know if E is elsewhere? For example, the secret could have multiple E's? So LIEGE might be okay, but it has E in position 3 as well? So if we guess LIEGE, position 3 E: if secret has E only at 5, position 3 E would be incorrect? And E at 5 is correct.

But let me check: we know E is at position 5. We don't know if E is elsewhere? It could be.

So LIEGE: has E at 3 and 5. Letter E: if secret has E only at 5, then position 3 E would be feedback '-' or 'x'? Since E is in the word but not at position 3, it should be '-'.

Similarly for other positions.

But to keep it simple, for position 2 candidates:
- MIDGE: M,I,D,G,E
- TITLE: T,I,T,L,E — repeated T? 
- MINCE: M,I,N,C,E — 
- BIBLE: B,I,B,L,E — repeated B

Position 4: MOVIE, or other words: OXIDE? But O,X,I,D,E — positions: 1:O,2:X,3:I,4:D,5:E? OXIDE has I in position 3? Not position 4. OXIDE: O(1),X(2),I(3),D(4),E(5) — that has I in position 3? We don't want that since we know I not in position 3.

MOVIE: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5) — I is in position 4.

So that's good.

Possible guesses: MIDGE, MINCE, MOVIE, INKLE, etc.

We also want to cover new letters. Since we have few known letters (only E and I), we should use more common new letters to test.

Let me prioritize: MOVIE uses M,O,V,I,E. I is known, E is confirmed. M,O,V are new.

MIDGE: M,I,D,G,E — similar.

INKLE: I,N,K,L,E — N,K,L new.

Considering letter frequencies: in remaining consonants, common ones include N, T, L, etc. But T is not excluded yet? From feedback, we only know R,A,S excluded. Letters we haven't used: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We want to include several of these.

Moreover, we want to put I in a new position to test where it is.

Currently available positions: 1,2,4 (since 3 is known wrong for I, and 5 is E).

So let's try position 4: MOVIE has I in position 4.

If we guess MOVIE, feedback:
- If I is actually in position 4, then it would be ✓ for I at position 4?
- If not, then - or x? Since we know I is in the word somewhere, if not position 4, it would be '-' and we know it must be in 1 or 2.

Perhaps that's efficient.

Similarly, MOVIE is a common word.

Another candidate: ""MOIRE""? But OIRE? MOIRE: M,O,I,R,E — has R? R is excluded? We cannot use R because feedback said R not in word. R was x, so MOIRE invalid because of R.

So MOVIE: valid? Moves in the game exist? Yes.

Similarly, ""PRIME""? But P,R,I,M,E — R excluded? No, R is not allowed.

So MOVIE seems fine.

Similarly, ""NINJA""? But not ends with E? And no E? Must end with E.

Another: ""WHINE""? W,H,I,N,E — positions: W1, H2, I3, N4, E5? But I is in position 3, which we should avoid? Since we don't want position 3.

If I want to test position 2: ""MINCE"" is M,I,N,C,E — I in position 2.

""MIDGE"": M,I,D,G,E — I in position 2.

Position 1: INKLE: I,N,K,L,E — I in position 1.

Let's choose between these.

Perhaps try to include consonants that are common: T, L, N, etc. but MOVIE doesn't have T or L.

To gather more information, perhaps a word with more new common letters.

Common consonants: T, N, L, O, U, etc.

So ""TILE"" is 4 letters.

""AMINE""? But A excluded.

""ELIDE""? E,L,I,D,E — ends with E? Positions: E1, L2, I3, D4, E5. But E in position 1? We don't know if E is elsewhere? And I in position 3? We shouldn't put I in position 3. Also, E at position 1: if secret E is only at 5, then position 1 E would be '-' (since E is present elsewhere) or 'x'? Not sure: if secret has only one E, and E is at 5, then position 1 E would be '-', meaning in the word but wrong position? But E is at 5 already? Feedback checks each letter independently? Actually, the Wordle rules: if you have duplicates in guess, the feedback accounts for duplicates in secret? For example, if secret has one E and guess has two E's, one might be yellow and one green? But in this case, if secret has only E at position 5, guess has E at position 1 and 5: position 5 is ✓, position 1 is '-' because E is present at position 5? But actually, that's correct? Yes.

In ELIDE, guess E at position 1: assuming secret has E at 5, not at 1, it would be '-' because E exists in the word elsewhere? Exactly like Wordle rules.

But we don't know if secret has E twice or not.

So ELIDE: positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E — but I is in position 3? Avoid position 3.

So ELIDE not good for that reason.

Instead, words like MOVIE (I at position 4) or MIDGE (I at position 2).

I think MOVIE is a good candidate.

Or perhaps ""BICE"" not 5 letters.

Another idea: ""CHIME"" — C,H,I,M,E — positions: C1, H2, I3, M4, E5. Again, I in position 3? Avoid.

""PHONE""? Ends with E? P,H,O,N,E — no I? We must contain I? Because we know I is in the word? From feedback, I is in the word (since '-' in RAISE), so our new guess must contain I? Not necessarily? But if we don't include I, we don't get information about it? That would be wasteful. Since we know I is present, we should include it to find its position.

So yes, the new guess must include I.

Therefore, MOVIE: has I at position 4.

Similarly, ""QUITE""? Q,U,I,T,E — positions: Q1,U2,I3,T4,E5 — I in position 3 again? Avoid.

""ABIDE"" has A, excluded.

So MOVIE seems a reasonable choice.

MIDGE is good too? MIDGE: positions:1:M,2:I,3:D,4:G,5:E.

I in position 2.

In terms of commonality, MOVIE might be better.

But let's decide: MOVIE.

So I'll guess MOVIE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is not in the word (x).
- A is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in position E(✓).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must contain E in position 5.
- The letter I must be present, but not in position 3.
- The letters R, A, and S are absent and should be avoided in future guesses.
- Possible positions for I are 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect and position 5 is occupied by E).
- The next guess should end with E, include I in an untested position (1, 2, or 4), and exclude R, A, and S to gather more information about other letters.

For this guess, ""MOVIE"" is chosen because:
- It ends with E, maintaining the known correct position.
- It places I in position 4 (a new, untested position to potentially identify the correct position of I).
- It includes new common letters (M, O, V) to test their presence or absence.
- It avoids R, A, and S.

If I is in position 4 of the secret word, this will give a correct position (✓); if not, it might show as misplaced (-), narrowing I's possible locations to position 1 or 2. Feedback on M, O, and V will help constrain future guesses.",Guess 2: MOVIE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) V(x) I(-) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,NICHE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There's no prior feedback to go on, so we want a word that can give us a lot of information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and be composed of distinct letters to maximize information.

 Let's pick a word that has some of the most common letters in English 5-letter words.
 Common initial guesses: ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it has R, A, I, S, E which are common letters.

 <guess>RAISE</guess><thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, I need to choose a word that maximizes the information I get back. Ideally, I want a word with common letters and minimal repetition to cover more possibilities. Common starting words include ""CRATE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""RAISE,"" and ""ROAST."" 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" for the following reasons:
- It uses five distinct letters.
- Contains common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S).
- The letters R, S, and E are particularly prevalent in English words, so their feedback (whether present or absent) will help narrow down future guesses significantly.

This guess will tell me:
- If R, A, I, S, or E are in the word.
- If any are in the correct position (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x).

This sets up a strong foundation for the next guess.
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, from this we know:
- E is definitely in the word and it is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E
- I is in the word, but not in the third position (since it was guessed in third but is misplaced). It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- R, A, and S are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we must choose a new guess that:
- Ends with E (since E is in the correct position).
- Contains the letter I, but not in position 3 (because the feedback for I was misplaced, so position 3 is wrong). Also, since I is present, we should include it in a different position.
- Does not contain R, A, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, having I in a position other than 3, and excluding R, A, S.

Possible positions for I: since it can't be in position 3, and we don't know where it is, we can try putting it in position 1, 2, or 4.

Also, we should aim to use common letters to get more feedback.

Let me think of words ending in E that contain I and exclude R, A, S.

Examples:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E -> words like ""INANE"", ""IMAGE"", but we don't know the other letters. But ""IMAGE"" has M and G which are new.
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E -> words like ""TITLE"", ""MINCE"", ""BIBLE"". But ""TITLE"" has T and L; ""MINCE"" has M, N, C; ""BIBLE"" repeats B and has L. We need to consider which letters are likely.

Since we have eliminated R, A, S, we can focus on other consonants or vowels.

But wait: we know E is at the end, so let's try to fix that and build.

Common words ending in E: like ALIVE, ABIDE, BRINE, CHIME, etc. But exclude R,A,S. So ALIVE has A (which is excluded) and L,I,V,E. But A is not allowed. Similarly, ABIDE has A.

What about ""OLIVE""? O,L,I,V,E. Does it have R,A,S? No. So OLIVE: positions: O in 1, L in 2, I in 3, V in 4, E in 5.

But wait, our feedback says I was misplaced in position 3. In ""RAISE"" we had I in position 3 and feedback said wrong position. So in the secret word, position 3 is not I. But in OLIVE, we are putting I in position 3 again? That would be the same position? It could be that the secret word doesn't have I in position 3, but we don't know if I is in another position. If I use OLIVE and put I in position 3 again, if in the actual word I is in position 3, we get conflicting feedback? But no: our feedback already says position 3 is wrong for I, so we must not put I in position 3 again.

Therefore, in OLIVE, if I put I in position 3, that would be trying the same position where we know it doesn't belong? No, the feedback said - for I, meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So wherever I is, it's not 3. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put I in position 3 and it gets -, it means still wrong position? But we already know it's not 3? Actually, we shouldn't put I in position 3 at all because we know it's incorrect for that position.

So for OLIVE, I is at position 3, which we know is wrong. Therefore, if we guess OLIVE, the feedback for I will be again '-' or possibly '✓'? But we don't know where I is. It's inefficient to try I in position 3 again when we know it's incorrect.

So a better strategy is to try I in a different position. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.

Therefore, words like:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E -> e.g., IMAGE (but has A, excluded), INKLE (I,N,K,L,E), but INKLE is a word? Yes. Or IVORY? But not ending with E? Ivory ends with Y, no.

IMAGE is invalid because it contains A, which is excluded.

INKLE: I, N, K, L, E. That is: I in pos1, N in pos2, K in pos3, L in pos4, E in pos5. This avoids R,A,S, and puts I in a new position? Previously I was in pos3, now pos1.

Similarly, position 2: _ I _ _ E -> e.g., TIGER, but TIGER has T,I,G,E,R? R is excluded. Words with I in second position: LIKE, FINE, WIPE, etc.

LIKE: L,I,K,E — but that's only 4 letters? LIKE has 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So ""OLIVE"" with I in position 3 is bad because of position.

Another position 4: _ _ _ I E -> that would be like .. I E at end. E is already at end. So words ending with IE? Like MOVIE, COTIE? But MOVIE is M,O,V,I,E — has I in position 4.

Also, we don't know about the other letters.

Possible words: 
- Ending in E, excluding R,A,S, have I in position 1,2, or 4.

Position 1: 
- INDEX: I,N,D,E,X? E at end, and positions: I(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), X(5)? Not ending with E? INDEX ends with X. We need last letter E.

Word must end in E. Any word with E at the 5th position.

So position 1: I? Start with I and end with E: e.g., IMAGE (invalid: A), ISLE? But ISLE ends with E? S is excluded. INLINE? Not 5 letters.

ICE? Too short.

Look for 5-letter words: IVOTE? Not a word.

IRENE? But has R (excluded, since R was x).

So IRENE invalid.

IGLOE? Not standard. 

IDE? Too short.

Perhaps ""INURE""? But has R? And U,N,E? INURE: I(1), N(2), U(3), R(4), E(5) — R is present? But R is excluded (feedback said x for R). So INURE has R, which is bad.

Another one: ""ILIKE""? Not a word.

Position 2: 
- LIGHT? Ends with T. Not E.

MIDGE? M,I,D,G,E — ends with E? No, MIDGE is M,I,D,G,E? That would be E at end? Positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. Yes, MIDGE is a word.

Similarly, ""TITLE"" ends with E? T,I,T,L,E — T at 5 would be E? Positions: 1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E — yes.

But TITLE has T appearing twice? Also, we don't care about repetition? It's allowed, but the secret word might have duplicate letters? Feedback doesn't distinguish that? From rules, the feedback is per letter in the word, but duplicate letters: the feedback will mark the occurrences correctly? For example, if secret has two Ts, and guess has one T, it might be inconsistent? But for now, let's assume no duplicates? Not necessarily.

Similarly, ""MINCE"" : M,I,N,C,E.

""BIBLE"" : B,I,B,L,E — B repeated.

Position 4: e.g., MOVIE: M,O,V,I,E — so I in position 4.

""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is a new position? Previously was position 3.

In our first guess, E was at position 5 and was correct. So for MOVIE, E is position 5? Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:I, 5:E — yes, E at 5.

Also, MOVIE does not have R, A, S? M,O,V,I,E — all new letters? Except E, which we know.

Moreover, I is included, so we can see if I is in position 4 or not.

So possible candidates:
- Position 1: hard to find words without R,A,S. INKLE? I(1),N(2),K(3),L(4),E(5) — yes, and INKLE is a word (a type of thread).
- Position 2: MIDGE (M,I,D,G,E), TITLE (T,I,T,L,E), ALIKE? But A is excluded? ALIKE has A? So no. LIEGE? L,I,E,G,E — but E is repeated? And in our guess, positions: 1:L,2:I,3:? — LIEGE is L,I,E,G,E — positions: 1:L,2:I,3:E,4:G,5:E. E at position 3 and 5? But E is in the word already at 5? In secret, we know E is only at 5? We don't know if E is elsewhere? For example, the secret could have multiple E's? So LIEGE might be okay, but it has E in position 3 as well? So if we guess LIEGE, position 3 E: if secret has E only at 5, position 3 E would be incorrect? And E at 5 is correct.

But let me check: we know E is at position 5. We don't know if E is elsewhere? It could be.

So LIEGE: has E at 3 and 5. Letter E: if secret has E only at 5, then position 3 E would be feedback '-' or 'x'? Since E is in the word but not at position 3, it should be '-'.

Similarly for other positions.

But to keep it simple, for position 2 candidates:
- MIDGE: M,I,D,G,E
- TITLE: T,I,T,L,E — repeated T? 
- MINCE: M,I,N,C,E — 
- BIBLE: B,I,B,L,E — repeated B

Position 4: MOVIE, or other words: OXIDE? But O,X,I,D,E — positions: 1:O,2:X,3:I,4:D,5:E? OXIDE has I in position 3? Not position 4. OXIDE: O(1),X(2),I(3),D(4),E(5) — that has I in position 3? We don't want that since we know I not in position 3.

MOVIE: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5) — I is in position 4.

So that's good.

Possible guesses: MIDGE, MINCE, MOVIE, INKLE, etc.

We also want to cover new letters. Since we have few known letters (only E and I), we should use more common new letters to test.

Let me prioritize: MOVIE uses M,O,V,I,E. I is known, E is confirmed. M,O,V are new.

MIDGE: M,I,D,G,E — similar.

INKLE: I,N,K,L,E — N,K,L new.

Considering letter frequencies: in remaining consonants, common ones include N, T, L, etc. But T is not excluded yet? From feedback, we only know R,A,S excluded. Letters we haven't used: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We want to include several of these.

Moreover, we want to put I in a new position to test where it is.

Currently available positions: 1,2,4 (since 3 is known wrong for I, and 5 is E).

So let's try position 4: MOVIE has I in position 4.

If we guess MOVIE, feedback:
- If I is actually in position 4, then it would be ✓ for I at position 4?
- If not, then - or x? Since we know I is in the word somewhere, if not position 4, it would be '-' and we know it must be in 1 or 2.

Perhaps that's efficient.

Similarly, MOVIE is a common word.

Another candidate: ""MOIRE""? But OIRE? MOIRE: M,O,I,R,E — has R? R is excluded? We cannot use R because feedback said R not in word. R was x, so MOIRE invalid because of R.

So MOVIE: valid? Moves in the game exist? Yes.

Similarly, ""PRIME""? But P,R,I,M,E — R excluded? No, R is not allowed.

So MOVIE seems fine.

Similarly, ""NINJA""? But not ends with E? And no E? Must end with E.

Another: ""WHINE""? W,H,I,N,E — positions: W1, H2, I3, N4, E5? But I is in position 3, which we should avoid? Since we don't want position 3.

If I want to test position 2: ""MINCE"" is M,I,N,C,E — I in position 2.

""MIDGE"": M,I,D,G,E — I in position 2.

Position 1: INKLE: I,N,K,L,E — I in position 1.

Let's choose between these.

Perhaps try to include consonants that are common: T, L, N, etc. but MOVIE doesn't have T or L.

To gather more information, perhaps a word with more new common letters.

Common consonants: T, N, L, O, U, etc.

So ""TILE"" is 4 letters.

""AMINE""? But A excluded.

""ELIDE""? E,L,I,D,E — ends with E? Positions: E1, L2, I3, D4, E5. But E in position 1? We don't know if E is elsewhere? And I in position 3? We shouldn't put I in position 3. Also, E at position 1: if secret E is only at 5, then position 1 E would be '-' (since E is present elsewhere) or 'x'? Not sure: if secret has only one E, and E is at 5, then position 1 E would be '-', meaning in the word but wrong position? But E is at 5 already? Feedback checks each letter independently? Actually, the Wordle rules: if you have duplicates in guess, the feedback accounts for duplicates in secret? For example, if secret has one E and guess has two E's, one might be yellow and one green? But in this case, if secret has only E at position 5, guess has E at position 1 and 5: position 5 is ✓, position 1 is '-' because E is present at position 5? But actually, that's correct? Yes.

In ELIDE, guess E at position 1: assuming secret has E at 5, not at 1, it would be '-' because E exists in the word elsewhere? Exactly like Wordle rules.

But we don't know if secret has E twice or not.

So ELIDE: positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E — but I is in position 3? Avoid position 3.

So ELIDE not good for that reason.

Instead, words like MOVIE (I at position 4) or MIDGE (I at position 2).

I think MOVIE is a good candidate.

Or perhaps ""BICE"" not 5 letters.

Another idea: ""CHIME"" — C,H,I,M,E — positions: C1, H2, I3, M4, E5. Again, I in position 3? Avoid.

""PHONE""? Ends with E? P,H,O,N,E — no I? We must contain I? Because we know I is in the word? From feedback, I is in the word (since '-' in RAISE), so our new guess must contain I? Not necessarily? But if we don't include I, we don't get information about it? That would be wasteful. Since we know I is present, we should include it to find its position.

So yes, the new guess must include I.

Therefore, MOVIE: has I at position 4.

Similarly, ""QUITE""? Q,U,I,T,E — positions: Q1,U2,I3,T4,E5 — I in position 3 again? Avoid.

""ABIDE"" has A, excluded.

So MOVIE seems a reasonable choice.

MIDGE is good too? MIDGE: positions:1:M,2:I,3:D,4:G,5:E.

I in position 2.

In terms of commonality, MOVIE might be better.

But let's decide: MOVIE.

So I'll guess MOVIE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is not in the word (x).
- A is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in position E(✓).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must contain E in position 5.
- The letter I must be present, but not in position 3.
- The letters R, A, and S are absent and should be avoided in future guesses.
- Possible positions for I are 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect and position 5 is occupied by E).
- The next guess should end with E, include I in an untested position (1, 2, or 4), and exclude R, A, and S to gather more information about other letters.

For this guess, ""MOVIE"" is chosen because:
- It ends with E, maintaining the known correct position.
- It places I in position 4 (a new, untested position to potentially identify the correct position of I).
- It includes new common letters (M, O, V) to test their presence or absence.
- It avoids R, A, and S.

If I is in position 4 of the secret word, this will give a correct position (✓); if not, it might show as misplaced (-), narrowing I's possible locations to position 1 or 2. Feedback on M, O, and V will help constrain future guesses.

So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E\n- I is in the word, but not in the third position (since it was guessed in third but is misplaced). It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n- R, A, and S are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a new guess that:\n- Ends with E (since E is in the correct position).\n- Contains the letter I, but not in position 3 (because the feedback for I was misplaced, so position 3 is wrong). Also, since I is present, we should include it in a different position.\n- Does not contain R, A, or S.\n\nWe need a 5-letter word ending in E, having I in a position other than 3, and excluding R, A, S.\n\nPossible positions for I: since it can\'t be in position 3, and we don\'t know where it is, we can try putting it in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nAlso, we should aim to use common letters to get more feedback.\n\nLet me think of words ending in E that contain I and exclude R, A, S.\n\nExamples:\n- Position 1: I _ _ _ E -> words like ""INANE"", ""IMAGE"", but we don\'t know the other letters. But ""IMAGE"" has M and G which are new.\n- Position 2: _ I _ _ E -> words like ""TITLE"", ""MINCE"", ""BIBLE"". But ""TITLE"" has T and L; ""MINCE"" has M, N, C; ""BIBLE"" repeats B and has L. We need to consider which letters are likely.\n\nSince we have eliminated R, A, S, we can focus on other consonants or vowels.\n\nBut wait: we know E is at the end, so let\'s try to fix that and build.\n\nCommon words ending in E: like ALIVE, ABIDE, BRINE, CHIME, etc. But exclude R,A,S. So ALIVE has A (which is excluded) and L,I,V,E. But A is not allowed. Similarly, ABIDE has A.\n\nWhat about ""OLIVE""? O,L,I,V,E. Does it have R,A,S? No. So OLIVE: positions: O in 1, L in 2, I in 3, V in 4, E in 5.\n\nBut wait, our feedback says I was misplaced in position 3. In ""RAISE"" we had I in position 3 and feedback said wrong position. So in the secret word, position 3 is not I. But in OLIVE, we are putting I in position 3 again? That would be the same position? It could be that the secret word doesn\'t have I in position 3, but we don\'t know if I is in another position. If I use OLIVE and put I in position 3 again, if in the actual word I is in position 3, we get conflicting feedback? But no: our feedback already says position 3 is wrong for I, so we must not put I in position 3 again.\n\nTherefore, in OLIVE, if I put I in position 3, that would be trying the same position where we know it doesn\'t belong? No, the feedback said - for I, meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So wherever I is, it\'s not 3. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put I in position 3 and it gets -, it means still wrong position? But we already know it\'s not 3? Actually, we shouldn\'t put I in position 3 at all because we know it\'s incorrect for that position.\n\nSo for OLIVE, I is at position 3, which we know is wrong. Therefore, if we guess OLIVE, the feedback for I will be again \'-\' or possibly \'✓\'? But we don\'t know where I is. It\'s inefficient to try I in position 3 again when we know it\'s incorrect.\n\nSo a better strategy is to try I in a different position. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.\n\nTherefore, words like:\n- Position 1: I _ _ _ E -> e.g., IMAGE (but has A, excluded), INKLE (I,N,K,L,E), but INKLE is a word? Yes. Or IVORY? But not ending with E? Ivory ends with Y, no.\n\nIMAGE is invalid because it contains A, which is excluded.\n\nINKLE: I, N, K, L, E. That is: I in pos1, N in pos2, K in pos3, L in pos4, E in pos5. This avoids R,A,S, and puts I in a new position? Previously I was in pos3, now pos1.\n\nSimilarly, position 2: _ I _ _ E -> e.g., TIGER, but TIGER has T,I,G,E,R? R is excluded. Words with I in second position: LIKE, FINE, WIPE, etc.\n\nLIKE: L,I,K,E — but that\'s only 4 letters? LIKE has 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So ""OLIVE"" with I in position 3 is bad because of position.\n\nAnother position 4: _ _ _ I E -> that would be like .. I E at end. E is already at end. So words ending with IE? Like MOVIE, COTIE? But MOVIE is M,O,V,I,E — has I in position 4.\n\nAlso, we don\'t know about the other letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- Ending in E, excluding R,A,S, have I in position 1,2, or 4.\n\nPosition 1: \n- INDEX: I,N,D,E,X? E at end, and positions: I(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), X(5)? Not ending with E? INDEX ends with X. We need last letter E.\n\nWord must end in E. Any word with E at the 5th position.\n\nSo position 1: I? Start with I and end with E: e.g., IMAGE (invalid: A), ISLE? But ISLE ends with E? S is excluded. INLINE? Not 5 letters.\n\nICE? Too short.\n\nLook for 5-letter words: IVOTE? Not a word.\n\nIRENE? But has R (excluded, since R was x).\n\nSo IRENE invalid.\n\nIGLOE? Not standard. \n\nIDE? Too short.\n\nPerhaps ""INURE""? But has R? And U,N,E? INURE: I(1), N(2), U(3), R(4), E(5) — R is present? But R is excluded (feedback said x for R). So INURE has R, which is bad.\n\nAnother one: ""ILIKE""? Not a word.\n\nPosition 2: \n- LIGHT? Ends with T. Not E.\n\nMIDGE? M,I,D,G,E — ends with E? No, MIDGE is M,I,D,G,E? That would be E at end? Positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. Yes, MIDGE is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""TITLE"" ends with E? T,I,T,L,E — T at 5 would be E? Positions: 1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E — yes.\n\nBut TITLE has T appearing twice? Also, we don\'t care about repetition? It\'s allowed, but the secret word might have duplicate letters? Feedback doesn\'t distinguish that? From rules, the feedback is per letter in the word, but duplicate letters: the feedback will mark the occurrences correctly? For example, if secret has two Ts, and guess has one T, it might be inconsistent? But for now, let\'s assume no duplicates? Not necessarily.\n\nSimilarly, ""MINCE"" : M,I,N,C,E.\n\n""BIBLE"" : B,I,B,L,E — B repeated.\n\nPosition 4: e.g., MOVIE: M,O,V,I,E — so I in position 4.\n\n""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is a new position? Previously was position 3.\n\nIn our first guess, E was at position 5 and was correct. So for MOVIE, E is position 5? Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:I, 5:E — yes, E at 5.\n\nAlso, MOVIE does not have R, A, S? M,O,V,I,E — all new letters? Except E, which we know.\n\nMoreover, I is included, so we can see if I is in position 4 or not.\n\nSo possible candidates:\n- Position 1: hard to find words without R,A,S. INKLE? I(1),N(2),K(3),L(4),E(5) — yes, and INKLE is a word (a type of thread).\n- Position 2: MIDGE (M,I,D,G,E), TITLE (T,I,T,L,E), ALIKE? But A is excluded? ALIKE has A? So no. LIEGE? L,I,E,G,E — but E is repeated? And in our guess, positions: 1:L,2:I,3:? — LIEGE is L,I,E,G,E — positions: 1:L,2:I,3:E,4:G,5:E. E at position 3 and 5? But E is in the word already at 5? In secret, we know E is only at 5? We don\'t know if E is elsewhere? For example, the secret could have multiple E\'s? So LIEGE might be okay, but it has E in position 3 as well? So if we guess LIEGE, position 3 E: if secret has E only at 5, position 3 E would be incorrect? And E at 5 is correct.\n\nBut let me check: we know E is at position 5. We don\'t know if E is elsewhere? It could be.\n\nSo LIEGE: has E at 3 and 5. Letter E: if secret has E only at 5, then position 3 E would be feedback \'-\' or \'x\'? Since E is in the word but not at position 3, it should be \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nBut to keep it simple, for position 2 candidates:\n- MIDGE: M,I,D,G,E\n- TITLE: T,I,T,L,E — repeated T? \n- MINCE: M,I,N,C,E — \n- BIBLE: B,I,B,L,E — repeated B\n\nPosition 4: MOVIE, or other words: OXIDE? But O,X,I,D,E — positions: 1:O,2:X,3:I,4:D,5:E? OXIDE has I in position 3? Not position 4. OXIDE: O(1),X(2),I(3),D(4),E(5) — that has I in position 3? We don\'t want that since we know I not in position 3.\n\nMOVIE: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5) — I is in position 4.\n\nSo that\'s good.\n\nPossible guesses: MIDGE, MINCE, MOVIE, INKLE, etc.\n\nWe also want to cover new letters. Since we have few known letters (only E and I), we should use more common new letters to test.\n\nLet me prioritize: MOVIE uses M,O,V,I,E. I is known, E is confirmed. M,O,V are new.\n\nMIDGE: M,I,D,G,E — similar.\n\nINKLE: I,N,K,L,E — N,K,L new.\n\nConsidering letter frequencies: in remaining consonants, common ones include N, T, L, etc. But T is not excluded yet? From feedback, we only know R,A,S excluded. Letters we haven\'t used: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe want to include several of these.\n\nMoreover, we want to put I in a new position to test where it is.\n\nCurrently available positions: 1,2,4 (since 3 is known wrong for I, and 5 is E).\n\nSo let\'s try position 4: MOVIE has I in position 4.\n\nIf we guess MOVIE, feedback:\n- If I is actually in position 4, then it would be ✓ for I at position 4?\n- If not, then - or x? Since we know I is in the word somewhere, if not position 4, it would be \'-\' and we know it must be in 1 or 2.\n\nPerhaps that\'s efficient.\n\nSimilarly, MOVIE is a common word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MOIRE""? But OIRE? MOIRE: M,O,I,R,E — has R? R is excluded? We cannot use R because feedback said R not in word. R was x, so MOIRE invalid because of R.\n\nSo MOVIE: valid? Moves in the game exist? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRIME""? But P,R,I,M,E — R excluded? No, R is not allowed.\n\nSo MOVIE seems fine.\n\nSimilarly, ""NINJA""? But not ends with E? And no E? Must end with E.\n\nAnother: ""WHINE""? W,H,I,N,E — positions: W1, H2, I3, N4, E5? But I is in position 3, which we should avoid? Since we don\'t want position 3.\n\nIf I want to test position 2: ""MINCE"" is M,I,N,C,E — I in position 2.\n\n""MIDGE"": M,I,D,G,E — I in position 2.\n\nPosition 1: INKLE: I,N,K,L,E — I in position 1.\n\nLet\'s choose between these.\n\nPerhaps try to include consonants that are common: T, L, N, etc. but MOVIE doesn\'t have T or L.\n\nTo gather more information, perhaps a word with more new common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: T, N, L, O, U, etc.\n\nSo ""TILE"" is 4 letters.\n\n""AMINE""? But A excluded.\n\n""ELIDE""? E,L,I,D,E — ends with E? Positions: E1, L2, I3, D4, E5. But E in position 1? We don\'t know if E is elsewhere? And I in position 3? We shouldn\'t put I in position 3. Also, E at position 1: if secret E is only at 5, then position 1 E would be \'-\' (since E is present elsewhere) or \'x\'? Not sure: if secret has only one E, and E is at 5, then position 1 E would be \'-\', meaning in the word but wrong position? But E is at 5 already? Feedback checks each letter independently? Actually, the Wordle rules: if you have duplicates in guess, the feedback accounts for duplicates in secret? For example, if secret has one E and guess has two E\'s, one might be yellow and one green? But in this case, if secret has only E at position 5, guess has E at position 1 and 5: position 5 is ✓, position 1 is \'-\' because E is present at position 5? But actually, that\'s correct? Yes.\n\nIn ELIDE, guess E at position 1: assuming secret has E at 5, not at 1, it would be \'-\' because E exists in the word elsewhere? Exactly like Wordle rules.\n\nBut we don\'t know if secret has E twice or not.\n\nSo ELIDE: positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E — but I is in position 3? Avoid position 3.\n\nSo ELIDE not good for that reason.\n\nInstead, words like MOVIE (I at position 4) or MIDGE (I at position 2).\n\nI think MOVIE is a good candidate.\n\nOr perhaps ""BICE"" not 5 letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""CHIME"" — C,H,I,M,E — positions: C1, H2, I3, M4, E5. Again, I in position 3? Avoid.\n\n""PHONE""? Ends with E? P,H,O,N,E — no I? We must contain I? Because we know I is in the word? From feedback, I is in the word (since \'-\' in RAISE), so our new guess must contain I? Not necessarily? But if we don\'t include I, we don\'t get information about it? That would be wasteful. Since we know I is present, we should include it to find its position.\n\nSo yes, the new guess must include I.\n\nTherefore, MOVIE: has I at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""QUITE""? Q,U,I,T,E — positions: Q1,U2,I3,T4,E5 — I in position 3 again? Avoid.\n\n""ABIDE"" has A, excluded.\n\nSo MOVIE seems a reasonable choice.\n\nMIDGE is good too? MIDGE: positions:1:M,2:I,3:D,4:G,5:E.\n\nI in position 2.\n\nIn terms of commonality, MOVIE might be better.\n\nBut let\'s decide: MOVIE.\n\nSo I\'ll guess MOVIE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is not in the word (x).\n- A is not in the word (x).\n- I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).\n- S is not in the word (x).\n- E is in the word and in position E(✓).\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word must contain E in position 5.\n- The letter I must be present, but not in position 3.\n- The letters R, A, and S are absent and should be avoided in future guesses.\n- Possible positions for I are 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect and position 5 is occupied by E).\n- The next guess should end with E, include I in an untested position (1, 2, or 4), and exclude R, A, and S to gather more information about other letters.\n\nFor this guess, ""MOVIE"" is chosen because:\n- It ends with E, maintaining the known correct position.\n- It places I in position 4 (a new, untested position to potentially identify the correct position of I).\n- It includes new common letters (M, O, V) to test their presence or absence.\n- It avoids R, A, and S.\n\nIf I is in position 4 of the secret word, this will give a correct position (✓); if not, it might show as misplaced (-), narrowing I\'s possible locations to position 1 or 2. Feedback on M, O, and V will help constrain future guesses.\n\n<guess>MOVIE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: MOVIE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) V(x) I(-) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- I: - (in word, wrong position)
- S: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

Guess 2: MOVIE
- M: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- V: x (not in word)
- I: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time I is misplaced, so it's not in position 3 or 4.
- E: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)

Deductions so far:
1. E is in position 5 and is correct.
2. I is in the word but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, I must be in position 1 or 2.
3. The following letters are not in the word: R, A, S, M, O, V.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains I in either position 1 or 2 (since it can't be in 3 or 4, and 5 is E).
- Avoids the letters R, A, S, M, O, V.

Additionally, we should try to cover new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters not yet excluded.

Excluded letters: R, A, S, M, O, V.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (and I, E which are known present).

We should aim for a word that has I in position 1 or 2 and uses common letters to maximize information.

Let's consider position 1: I _ _ _ E
Possible words: 
- ILLEGAL? Too long, 6 letters.
- IMBUE? Not ending with E.
- IGNORE? Has O and R, excluded.
- IMAGE? Has A and M, excluded.
- INANE? Has A, excluded.
- INKLE: I, N, K, L, E — all available? Yes: I(1), N(2), K(3), L(4), E(5). INKLE is a word (a type of thread or to mend with thread).

Position 2: _ I _ _ E
Examples:
- TITLE: T(1), I(2), T(3), L(4), E(5) — but T is repeated? And we don't know if T is in the word. Also, T is available.
- BIBLE: B(1), I(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) — B repeated.
- PIECE: P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5) — E repeated? And E at position 3: we know E is at 5, but it might be elsewhere? But we don't know.
- DICE? 4 letters.
- LIGHT? Not ending with E.
- WIPED? W(1), I(2), P(3), E(4), D(5) — but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. So not.
- Must end with E: so _ I _ _ E.

More words: 
- TIGER? Has R, excluded.
- LIVER? Has R, excluded.
- WIDEN? Not ending with E.
- MINCE? Has M, excluded.
- DANCE? Has A? D,A,N,C,E — A is excluded? Yes, A is not allowed.
- PIQUE? P,I,Q,U,E — ends with E? Positions: P(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5). But Q and U are less common, but possible.

Another: ""BIGOT""? Not ending with E.

""FILET""? F,I,L,E,T — ends with T, not E.

""GUISE""? G,U,I,S,E — but S is excluded? S is not allowed.

""QUITE""? Q,U,I,T,E — positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) — but I is in position 3? We cannot put I in position 3 because we know it's not there? From previous feedback, I is not in position 3 or 4. So in QUITE, I is in position 3, which is invalid? We should avoid position 3 for I.

Similarly, for position 1 pattern: INKLE (I in 1) or for position 2: we need a word with I in 2 and E in 5.

Another word: ""ALIKE""? But A is excluded.

""GLIDE""? G,L,I,D,E — positions: G(1), L(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) — I in position 3? Avoid.

""WHITE""? W,H,I,T,E — positions: W(1), H(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) — again I in 3? Avoid.

So for position 2, we need a word where I is in position 2 and the third letter is not I? But the pattern is _ I _ _ E, so I is in position 2, and the third and fourth are other letters.

But we don't want to put I in position 3? In this pattern, I is only in position 2, so that's fine. The issue is that we are not putting I in position 3. For example, ""TITLE"" has I in position 2, which is acceptable? Yes, because we haven't tested position 2 for I.

In ""TITLE"": positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:T, 4:L, 5:E.

I is in position 2, which is a new position to test.

Similarly, ""BIBLE"": 1:B, 2:I, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E.

But repeated B.

""LITHE""? L,I,T,H,E — positions: L(1), I(2), T(3), H(4), E(5). Yes, and no repeated letters.

""LITHE"" is a word (flexible or to warm with fire).

Also, ""WITHE""? W,I,T,H,E — similar.

But let's list available words.

Since I must be in position 1 or 2, and we have two options, we can choose one to test.

Option 1: I in position 1, e.g., INKLE: I,N,K,L,E

Option 2: I in position 2, e.g., TITLE: T,I,T,L,E (repeated T) or LITHE: L,I,T,H,E

We should avoid repeated letters if possible to get more information.

LITHE: L,I,T,H,E — all distinct except we don't know.

Another word: ""DINGE""? Not common.

""PIECE"" has E repeated? P,I,E,C,E — not 5 distinct? But allowed.

But E at position 3: if secret has only one E at 5, then position 3 E would be misplaced? But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid putting E in other positions? But it's okay.

But let's choose LITHE: L,I,T,H,E

Or ""NICHE"": N,I,C,H,E — positions: N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5). I in position 2.

NICHE is a common word.

Similarly, ""BITCH""? Not appropriate, and ends with H? BITCH is B,I,T,C,H — not E.

""PIXIE""? P,I,X,I,E — repeated I? And ends with E? P(1),I(2),X(3),I(4),E(5) — but I repeated? And we don't know if secret has two I's? But we only know one I so far.

But PIXIE has I in position 2 and 4? We know position 4 is not possible for I? From MOVIE feedback, I was in position 4 and got -, so I is not in position 4. Therefore, if we put I in position 4 again, it would be wrong? But we are putting I in position 2? In PIXIE, we have I in position 2 and 4. Position 4 I would be incorrect since we know I not in 4? So it would get x? But that doesn't help, and we waste a letter.

So better to avoid multiple I's? Or at least avoid position 4 for I.

Therefore, NICHE: N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5) — I only in position 2.

Similarly, LITHE: L(1), I(2), T(3), H(4), E(5)

Both are good.

Now, which one to choose? We can pick based on letter frequency to cover more common letters.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, etc.

NICHE has N, C, H.

LITHE has L, T, H.

T and N are very common.

Perhaps LITHE to include T.

But let's see the first option: INKLE with I in position 1: I,N,K,L,E — letters N,K,L.

K is less common.

So for position 2, LITHE or NICHE.

I'll go with LITHE to test T and L.

So guess: LITHE.

But let's confirm: LITHE is a valid word? Yes.

Feedback will tell us:
- If I is in position 2: if correct, we get ✓ for I at 2; if not, then I must be in position 1 (since we know it's not 3 or 4).
- Also, feedback on L, T, H.

If I is not in position 2, then it must be in position 1, and we can adjust next guess.

So <guess>LITHE</guess>

But we have to output in the format.

Thinking: we could also consider ""WHILE""? W,H,I,L,E — positions: W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5) — but I in position 3? Avoid.

No, so LITHE is better.

Another: ""THINE""? T,H,I,N,E — positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) — I in position 3? Avoid.

So LITHE seems good.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)**  
  - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
  - I is in the word but not in position 3.
  - R, A, and S are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: MOVIE → Feedback: M(x) O(x) V(x) I(-) E(✓)**  
  - E is confirmed at position 5 (no change).
  - I is still misplaced, so it cannot be in position 4 (since it was guessed there and marked as wrong position).
  - M, O, and V are not in the word.

### Key Deductions:
1. **E is fixed at position 5**.
2. **I must be in the word but not in positions 3 or 4**. Therefore, it must be in position 1 or 2.
3. **Excluded letters**: R, A, S, M, O, V (all marked as ""x"" in feedback).
4. **Available letters**: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (and I, E, which are known to be present).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- I must be included in position 1 or 2 to test its correct placement.
- Avoid excluded letters (R, A, S, M, O, V).
- Use new common letters (e.g., T, L, H, N) to maximize information gain.
- **Chosen word: LITHE** (meaning flexible, supple, or to warm with fire).
  - Pattern: `_ I _ _ E` (I in position 2).
  - Letters: L (position 1), I (position 2), T (position 3), H (position 4), E (position 5).
  - Why LITHE?
    - Tests I in position 2: If I is correct here, we get a ✓; if not, I must be in position 1 (since positions 3 and 4 are ruled out).
    - Introduces new common consonants (L, T, H) to check for presence/absence.
    - Avoids excluded letters and uses distinct letters for better feedback.

<guess>LITHE</guess>",LITHE,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- I: - (in word, wrong position)
- S: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

Guess 2: MOVIE
- M: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- V: x (not in word)
- I: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time I is misplaced, so it's not in position 3 or 4.
- E: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)

Deductions so far:
1. E is in position 5 and is correct.
2. I is in the word but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, I must be in position 1 or 2.
3. The following letters are not in the word: R, A, S, M, O, V.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains I in either position 1 or 2 (since it can't be in 3 or 4, and 5 is E).
- Avoids the letters R, A, S, M, O, V.

Additionally, we should try to cover new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters not yet excluded.

Excluded letters: R, A, S, M, O, V.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (and I, E which are known present).

We should aim for a word that has I in position 1 or 2 and uses common letters to maximize information.

Let's consider position 1: I _ _ _ E
Possible words: 
- ILLEGAL? Too long, 6 letters.
- IMBUE? Not ending with E.
- IGNORE? Has O and R, excluded.
- IMAGE? Has A and M, excluded.
- INANE? Has A, excluded.
- INKLE: I, N, K, L, E — all available? Yes: I(1), N(2), K(3), L(4), E(5). INKLE is a word (a type of thread or to mend with thread).

Position 2: _ I _ _ E
Examples:
- TITLE: T(1), I(2), T(3), L(4), E(5) — but T is repeated? And we don't know if T is in the word. Also, T is available.
- BIBLE: B(1), I(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) — B repeated.
- PIECE: P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5) — E repeated? And E at position 3: we know E is at 5, but it might be elsewhere? But we don't know.
- DICE? 4 letters.
- LIGHT? Not ending with E.
- WIPED? W(1), I(2), P(3), E(4), D(5) — but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. So not.
- Must end with E: so _ I _ _ E.

More words: 
- TIGER? Has R, excluded.
- LIVER? Has R, excluded.
- WIDEN? Not ending with E.
- MINCE? Has M, excluded.
- DANCE? Has A? D,A,N,C,E — A is excluded? Yes, A is not allowed.
- PIQUE? P,I,Q,U,E — ends with E? Positions: P(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5). But Q and U are less common, but possible.

Another: ""BIGOT""? Not ending with E.

""FILET""? F,I,L,E,T — ends with T, not E.

""GUISE""? G,U,I,S,E — but S is excluded? S is not allowed.

""QUITE""? Q,U,I,T,E — positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) — but I is in position 3? We cannot put I in position 3 because we know it's not there? From previous feedback, I is not in position 3 or 4. So in QUITE, I is in position 3, which is invalid? We should avoid position 3 for I.

Similarly, for position 1 pattern: INKLE (I in 1) or for position 2: we need a word with I in 2 and E in 5.

Another word: ""ALIKE""? But A is excluded.

""GLIDE""? G,L,I,D,E — positions: G(1), L(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) — I in position 3? Avoid.

""WHITE""? W,H,I,T,E — positions: W(1), H(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) — again I in 3? Avoid.

So for position 2, we need a word where I is in position 2 and the third letter is not I? But the pattern is _ I _ _ E, so I is in position 2, and the third and fourth are other letters.

But we don't want to put I in position 3? In this pattern, I is only in position 2, so that's fine. The issue is that we are not putting I in position 3. For example, ""TITLE"" has I in position 2, which is acceptable? Yes, because we haven't tested position 2 for I.

In ""TITLE"": positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:T, 4:L, 5:E.

I is in position 2, which is a new position to test.

Similarly, ""BIBLE"": 1:B, 2:I, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E.

But repeated B.

""LITHE""? L,I,T,H,E — positions: L(1), I(2), T(3), H(4), E(5). Yes, and no repeated letters.

""LITHE"" is a word (flexible or to warm with fire).

Also, ""WITHE""? W,I,T,H,E — similar.

But let's list available words.

Since I must be in position 1 or 2, and we have two options, we can choose one to test.

Option 1: I in position 1, e.g., INKLE: I,N,K,L,E

Option 2: I in position 2, e.g., TITLE: T,I,T,L,E (repeated T) or LITHE: L,I,T,H,E

We should avoid repeated letters if possible to get more information.

LITHE: L,I,T,H,E — all distinct except we don't know.

Another word: ""DINGE""? Not common.

""PIECE"" has E repeated? P,I,E,C,E — not 5 distinct? But allowed.

But E at position 3: if secret has only one E at 5, then position 3 E would be misplaced? But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid putting E in other positions? But it's okay.

But let's choose LITHE: L,I,T,H,E

Or ""NICHE"": N,I,C,H,E — positions: N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5). I in position 2.

NICHE is a common word.

Similarly, ""BITCH""? Not appropriate, and ends with H? BITCH is B,I,T,C,H — not E.

""PIXIE""? P,I,X,I,E — repeated I? And ends with E? P(1),I(2),X(3),I(4),E(5) — but I repeated? And we don't know if secret has two I's? But we only know one I so far.

But PIXIE has I in position 2 and 4? We know position 4 is not possible for I? From MOVIE feedback, I was in position 4 and got -, so I is not in position 4. Therefore, if we put I in position 4 again, it would be wrong? But we are putting I in position 2? In PIXIE, we have I in position 2 and 4. Position 4 I would be incorrect since we know I not in 4? So it would get x? But that doesn't help, and we waste a letter.

So better to avoid multiple I's? Or at least avoid position 4 for I.

Therefore, NICHE: N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5) — I only in position 2.

Similarly, LITHE: L(1), I(2), T(3), H(4), E(5)

Both are good.

Now, which one to choose? We can pick based on letter frequency to cover more common letters.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, etc.

NICHE has N, C, H.

LITHE has L, T, H.

T and N are very common.

Perhaps LITHE to include T.

But let's see the first option: INKLE with I in position 1: I,N,K,L,E — letters N,K,L.

K is less common.

So for position 2, LITHE or NICHE.

I'll go with LITHE to test T and L.

So guess: LITHE.

But let's confirm: LITHE is a valid word? Yes.

Feedback will tell us:
- If I is in position 2: if correct, we get ✓ for I at 2; if not, then I must be in position 1 (since we know it's not 3 or 4).
- Also, feedback on L, T, H.

If I is not in position 2, then it must be in position 1, and we can adjust next guess.

So <guess>LITHE</guess>

But we have to output in the format.

Thinking: we could also consider ""WHILE""? W,H,I,L,E — positions: W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5) — but I in position 3? Avoid.

No, so LITHE is better.

Another: ""THINE""? T,H,I,N,E — positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) — I in position 3? Avoid.

So LITHE seems good.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)**  
  - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
  - I is in the word but not in position 3.
  - R, A, and S are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: MOVIE → Feedback: M(x) O(x) V(x) I(-) E(✓)**  
  - E is confirmed at position 5 (no change).
  - I is still misplaced, so it cannot be in position 4 (since it was guessed there and marked as wrong position).
  - M, O, and V are not in the word.

### Key Deductions:
1. **E is fixed at position 5**.
2. **I must be in the word but not in positions 3 or 4**. Therefore, it must be in position 1 or 2.
3. **Excluded letters**: R, A, S, M, O, V (all marked as ""x"" in feedback).
4. **Available letters**: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (and I, E, which are known to be present).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- I must be included in position 1 or 2 to test its correct placement.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There's no prior feedback to go on, so we want a word that can give us a lot of information.
 A good starting word should have common letters and be composed of distinct letters to maximize information.

 Let's pick a word that has some of the most common letters in English 5-letter words.
 Common initial guesses: ""CRATE"", ""SLATE"", ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it has R, A, I, S, E which are common letters.

 <guess>RAISE</guess><thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, I need to choose a word that maximizes the information I get back. Ideally, I want a word with common letters and minimal repetition to cover more possibilities. Common starting words include ""CRATE,"" ""SLATE,"" ""RAISE,"" and ""ROAST."" 

I'll go with ""RAISE"" for the following reasons:
- It uses five distinct letters.
- Contains common vowels (A, E, I) and common consonants (R, S).
- The letters R, S, and E are particularly prevalent in English words, so their feedback (whether present or absent) will help narrow down future guesses significantly.

This guess will tell me:
- If R, A, I, S, or E are in the word.
- If any are in the correct position (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x).

This sets up a strong foundation for the next guess.
</thinking>

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: x (not in the word)
- I: - (in the word but wrong position)
- S: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)

So, from this we know:
- E is definitely in the word and it is the last letter (position 5). So the secret word has the form: _ _ _ _ E
- I is in the word, but not in the third position (since it was guessed in third but is misplaced). It could be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- R, A, and S are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we must choose a new guess that:
- Ends with E (since E is in the correct position).
- Contains the letter I, but not in position 3 (because the feedback for I was misplaced, so position 3 is wrong). Also, since I is present, we should include it in a different position.
- Does not contain R, A, or S.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, having I in a position other than 3, and excluding R, A, S.

Possible positions for I: since it can't be in position 3, and we don't know where it is, we can try putting it in position 1, 2, or 4.

Also, we should aim to use common letters to get more feedback.

Let me think of words ending in E that contain I and exclude R, A, S.

Examples:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E -> words like ""INANE"", ""IMAGE"", but we don't know the other letters. But ""IMAGE"" has M and G which are new.
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E -> words like ""TITLE"", ""MINCE"", ""BIBLE"". But ""TITLE"" has T and L; ""MINCE"" has M, N, C; ""BIBLE"" repeats B and has L. We need to consider which letters are likely.

Since we have eliminated R, A, S, we can focus on other consonants or vowels.

But wait: we know E is at the end, so let's try to fix that and build.

Common words ending in E: like ALIVE, ABIDE, BRINE, CHIME, etc. But exclude R,A,S. So ALIVE has A (which is excluded) and L,I,V,E. But A is not allowed. Similarly, ABIDE has A.

What about ""OLIVE""? O,L,I,V,E. Does it have R,A,S? No. So OLIVE: positions: O in 1, L in 2, I in 3, V in 4, E in 5.

But wait, our feedback says I was misplaced in position 3. In ""RAISE"" we had I in position 3 and feedback said wrong position. So in the secret word, position 3 is not I. But in OLIVE, we are putting I in position 3 again? That would be the same position? It could be that the secret word doesn't have I in position 3, but we don't know if I is in another position. If I use OLIVE and put I in position 3 again, if in the actual word I is in position 3, we get conflicting feedback? But no: our feedback already says position 3 is wrong for I, so we must not put I in position 3 again.

Therefore, in OLIVE, if I put I in position 3, that would be trying the same position where we know it doesn't belong? No, the feedback said - for I, meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So wherever I is, it's not 3. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put I in position 3 and it gets -, it means still wrong position? But we already know it's not 3? Actually, we shouldn't put I in position 3 at all because we know it's incorrect for that position.

So for OLIVE, I is at position 3, which we know is wrong. Therefore, if we guess OLIVE, the feedback for I will be again '-' or possibly '✓'? But we don't know where I is. It's inefficient to try I in position 3 again when we know it's incorrect.

So a better strategy is to try I in a different position. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.

Therefore, words like:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E -> e.g., IMAGE (but has A, excluded), INKLE (I,N,K,L,E), but INKLE is a word? Yes. Or IVORY? But not ending with E? Ivory ends with Y, no.

IMAGE is invalid because it contains A, which is excluded.

INKLE: I, N, K, L, E. That is: I in pos1, N in pos2, K in pos3, L in pos4, E in pos5. This avoids R,A,S, and puts I in a new position? Previously I was in pos3, now pos1.

Similarly, position 2: _ I _ _ E -> e.g., TIGER, but TIGER has T,I,G,E,R? R is excluded. Words with I in second position: LIKE, FINE, WIPE, etc.

LIKE: L,I,K,E — but that's only 4 letters? LIKE has 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So ""OLIVE"" with I in position 3 is bad because of position.

Another position 4: _ _ _ I E -> that would be like .. I E at end. E is already at end. So words ending with IE? Like MOVIE, COTIE? But MOVIE is M,O,V,I,E — has I in position 4.

Also, we don't know about the other letters.

Possible words: 
- Ending in E, excluding R,A,S, have I in position 1,2, or 4.

Position 1: 
- INDEX: I,N,D,E,X? E at end, and positions: I(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), X(5)? Not ending with E? INDEX ends with X. We need last letter E.

Word must end in E. Any word with E at the 5th position.

So position 1: I? Start with I and end with E: e.g., IMAGE (invalid: A), ISLE? But ISLE ends with E? S is excluded. INLINE? Not 5 letters.

ICE? Too short.

Look for 5-letter words: IVOTE? Not a word.

IRENE? But has R (excluded, since R was x).

So IRENE invalid.

IGLOE? Not standard. 

IDE? Too short.

Perhaps ""INURE""? But has R? And U,N,E? INURE: I(1), N(2), U(3), R(4), E(5) — R is present? But R is excluded (feedback said x for R). So INURE has R, which is bad.

Another one: ""ILIKE""? Not a word.

Position 2: 
- LIGHT? Ends with T. Not E.

MIDGE? M,I,D,G,E — ends with E? No, MIDGE is M,I,D,G,E? That would be E at end? Positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. Yes, MIDGE is a word.

Similarly, ""TITLE"" ends with E? T,I,T,L,E — T at 5 would be E? Positions: 1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E — yes.

But TITLE has T appearing twice? Also, we don't care about repetition? It's allowed, but the secret word might have duplicate letters? Feedback doesn't distinguish that? From rules, the feedback is per letter in the word, but duplicate letters: the feedback will mark the occurrences correctly? For example, if secret has two Ts, and guess has one T, it might be inconsistent? But for now, let's assume no duplicates? Not necessarily.

Similarly, ""MINCE"" : M,I,N,C,E.

""BIBLE"" : B,I,B,L,E — B repeated.

Position 4: e.g., MOVIE: M,O,V,I,E — so I in position 4.

""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is a new position? Previously was position 3.

In our first guess, E was at position 5 and was correct. So for MOVIE, E is position 5? Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:I, 5:E — yes, E at 5.

Also, MOVIE does not have R, A, S? M,O,V,I,E — all new letters? Except E, which we know.

Moreover, I is included, so we can see if I is in position 4 or not.

So possible candidates:
- Position 1: hard to find words without R,A,S. INKLE? I(1),N(2),K(3),L(4),E(5) — yes, and INKLE is a word (a type of thread).
- Position 2: MIDGE (M,I,D,G,E), TITLE (T,I,T,L,E), ALIKE? But A is excluded? ALIKE has A? So no. LIEGE? L,I,E,G,E — but E is repeated? And in our guess, positions: 1:L,2:I,3:? — LIEGE is L,I,E,G,E — positions: 1:L,2:I,3:E,4:G,5:E. E at position 3 and 5? But E is in the word already at 5? In secret, we know E is only at 5? We don't know if E is elsewhere? For example, the secret could have multiple E's? So LIEGE might be okay, but it has E in position 3 as well? So if we guess LIEGE, position 3 E: if secret has E only at 5, position 3 E would be incorrect? And E at 5 is correct.

But let me check: we know E is at position 5. We don't know if E is elsewhere? It could be.

So LIEGE: has E at 3 and 5. Letter E: if secret has E only at 5, then position 3 E would be feedback '-' or 'x'? Since E is in the word but not at position 3, it should be '-'.

Similarly for other positions.

But to keep it simple, for position 2 candidates:
- MIDGE: M,I,D,G,E
- TITLE: T,I,T,L,E — repeated T? 
- MINCE: M,I,N,C,E — 
- BIBLE: B,I,B,L,E — repeated B

Position 4: MOVIE, or other words: OXIDE? But O,X,I,D,E — positions: 1:O,2:X,3:I,4:D,5:E? OXIDE has I in position 3? Not position 4. OXIDE: O(1),X(2),I(3),D(4),E(5) — that has I in position 3? We don't want that since we know I not in position 3.

MOVIE: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5) — I is in position 4.

So that's good.

Possible guesses: MIDGE, MINCE, MOVIE, INKLE, etc.

We also want to cover new letters. Since we have few known letters (only E and I), we should use more common new letters to test.

Let me prioritize: MOVIE uses M,O,V,I,E. I is known, E is confirmed. M,O,V are new.

MIDGE: M,I,D,G,E — similar.

INKLE: I,N,K,L,E — N,K,L new.

Considering letter frequencies: in remaining consonants, common ones include N, T, L, etc. But T is not excluded yet? From feedback, we only know R,A,S excluded. Letters we haven't used: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

We want to include several of these.

Moreover, we want to put I in a new position to test where it is.

Currently available positions: 1,2,4 (since 3 is known wrong for I, and 5 is E).

So let's try position 4: MOVIE has I in position 4.

If we guess MOVIE, feedback:
- If I is actually in position 4, then it would be ✓ for I at position 4?
- If not, then - or x? Since we know I is in the word somewhere, if not position 4, it would be '-' and we know it must be in 1 or 2.

Perhaps that's efficient.

Similarly, MOVIE is a common word.

Another candidate: ""MOIRE""? But OIRE? MOIRE: M,O,I,R,E — has R? R is excluded? We cannot use R because feedback said R not in word. R was x, so MOIRE invalid because of R.

So MOVIE: valid? Moves in the game exist? Yes.

Similarly, ""PRIME""? But P,R,I,M,E — R excluded? No, R is not allowed.

So MOVIE seems fine.

Similarly, ""NINJA""? But not ends with E? And no E? Must end with E.

Another: ""WHINE""? W,H,I,N,E — positions: W1, H2, I3, N4, E5? But I is in position 3, which we should avoid? Since we don't want position 3.

If I want to test position 2: ""MINCE"" is M,I,N,C,E — I in position 2.

""MIDGE"": M,I,D,G,E — I in position 2.

Position 1: INKLE: I,N,K,L,E — I in position 1.

Let's choose between these.

Perhaps try to include consonants that are common: T, L, N, etc. but MOVIE doesn't have T or L.

To gather more information, perhaps a word with more new common letters.

Common consonants: T, N, L, O, U, etc.

So ""TILE"" is 4 letters.

""AMINE""? But A excluded.

""ELIDE""? E,L,I,D,E — ends with E? Positions: E1, L2, I3, D4, E5. But E in position 1? We don't know if E is elsewhere? And I in position 3? We shouldn't put I in position 3. Also, E at position 1: if secret E is only at 5, then position 1 E would be '-' (since E is present elsewhere) or 'x'? Not sure: if secret has only one E, and E is at 5, then position 1 E would be '-', meaning in the word but wrong position? But E is at 5 already? Feedback checks each letter independently? Actually, the Wordle rules: if you have duplicates in guess, the feedback accounts for duplicates in secret? For example, if secret has one E and guess has two E's, one might be yellow and one green? But in this case, if secret has only E at position 5, guess has E at position 1 and 5: position 5 is ✓, position 1 is '-' because E is present at position 5? But actually, that's correct? Yes.

In ELIDE, guess E at position 1: assuming secret has E at 5, not at 1, it would be '-' because E exists in the word elsewhere? Exactly like Wordle rules.

But we don't know if secret has E twice or not.

So ELIDE: positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E — but I is in position 3? Avoid position 3.

So ELIDE not good for that reason.

Instead, words like MOVIE (I at position 4) or MIDGE (I at position 2).

I think MOVIE is a good candidate.

Or perhaps ""BICE"" not 5 letters.

Another idea: ""CHIME"" — C,H,I,M,E — positions: C1, H2, I3, M4, E5. Again, I in position 3? Avoid.

""PHONE""? Ends with E? P,H,O,N,E — no I? We must contain I? Because we know I is in the word? From feedback, I is in the word (since '-' in RAISE), so our new guess must contain I? Not necessarily? But if we don't include I, we don't get information about it? That would be wasteful. Since we know I is present, we should include it to find its position.

So yes, the new guess must include I.

Therefore, MOVIE: has I at position 4.

Similarly, ""QUITE""? Q,U,I,T,E — positions: Q1,U2,I3,T4,E5 — I in position 3 again? Avoid.

""ABIDE"" has A, excluded.

So MOVIE seems a reasonable choice.

MIDGE is good too? MIDGE: positions:1:M,2:I,3:D,4:G,5:E.

I in position 2.

In terms of commonality, MOVIE might be better.

But let's decide: MOVIE.

So I'll guess MOVIE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R is not in the word (x).
- A is not in the word (x).
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).
- S is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word and in position E(✓).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must contain E in position 5.
- The letter I must be present, but not in position 3.
- The letters R, A, and S are absent and should be avoided in future guesses.
- Possible positions for I are 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect and position 5 is occupied by E).
- The next guess should end with E, include I in an untested position (1, 2, or 4), and exclude R, A, and S to gather more information about other letters.

For this guess, ""MOVIE"" is chosen because:
- It ends with E, maintaining the known correct position.
- It places I in position 4 (a new, untested position to potentially identify the correct position of I).
- It includes new common letters (M, O, V) to test their presence or absence.
- It avoids R, A, and S.

If I is in position 4 of the secret word, this will give a correct position (✓); if not, it might show as misplaced (-), narrowing I's possible locations to position 1 or 2. Feedback on M, O, and V will help constrain future guesses.

<guess>MOVIE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: MOVIE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) V(x) I(-) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x (not in word)
- A: x (not in word)
- I: - (in word, wrong position)
- S: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

Guess 2: MOVIE
- M: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- V: x (not in word)
- I: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time I is misplaced, so it's not in position 3 or 4.
- E: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)

Deductions so far:
1. E is in position 5 and is correct.
2. I is in the word but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, I must be in position 1 or 2.
3. The following letters are not in the word: R, A, S, M, O, V.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Contains I in either position 1 or 2 (since it can't be in 3 or 4, and 5 is E).
- Avoids the letters R, A, S, M, O, V.

Additionally, we should try to cover new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for I:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
- Position 2: _ I _ _ E

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters not yet excluded.

Excluded letters: R, A, S, M, O, V.

Available letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (and I, E which are known present).

We should aim for a word that has I in position 1 or 2 and uses common letters to maximize information.

Let's consider position 1: I _ _ _ E
Possible words: 
- ILLEGAL? Too long, 6 letters.
- IMBUE? Not ending with E.
- IGNORE? Has O and R, excluded.
- IMAGE? Has A and M, excluded.
- INANE? Has A, excluded.
- INKLE: I, N, K, L, E — all available? Yes: I(1), N(2), K(3), L(4), E(5). INKLE is a word (a type of thread or to mend with thread).

Position 2: _ I _ _ E
Examples:
- TITLE: T(1), I(2), T(3), L(4), E(5) — but T is repeated? And we don't know if T is in the word. Also, T is available.
- BIBLE: B(1), I(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) — B repeated.
- PIECE: P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5) — E repeated? And E at position 3: we know E is at 5, but it might be elsewhere? But we don't know.
- DICE? 4 letters.
- LIGHT? Not ending with E.
- WIPED? W(1), I(2), P(3), E(4), D(5) — but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. So not.
- Must end with E: so _ I _ _ E.

More words: 
- TIGER? Has R, excluded.
- LIVER? Has R, excluded.
- WIDEN? Not ending with E.
- MINCE? Has M, excluded.
- DANCE? Has A? D,A,N,C,E — A is excluded? Yes, A is not allowed.
- PIQUE? P,I,Q,U,E — ends with E? Positions: P(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5). But Q and U are less common, but possible.

Another: ""BIGOT""? Not ending with E.

""FILET""? F,I,L,E,T — ends with T, not E.

""GUISE""? G,U,I,S,E — but S is excluded? S is not allowed.

""QUITE""? Q,U,I,T,E — positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) — but I is in position 3? We cannot put I in position 3 because we know it's not there? From previous feedback, I is not in position 3 or 4. So in QUITE, I is in position 3, which is invalid? We should avoid position 3 for I.

Similarly, for position 1 pattern: INKLE (I in 1) or for position 2: we need a word with I in 2 and E in 5.

Another word: ""ALIKE""? But A is excluded.

""GLIDE""? G,L,I,D,E — positions: G(1), L(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) — I in position 3? Avoid.

""WHITE""? W,H,I,T,E — positions: W(1), H(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) — again I in 3? Avoid.

So for position 2, we need a word where I is in position 2 and the third letter is not I? But the pattern is _ I _ _ E, so I is in position 2, and the third and fourth are other letters.

But we don't want to put I in position 3? In this pattern, I is only in position 2, so that's fine. The issue is that we are not putting I in position 3. For example, ""TITLE"" has I in position 2, which is acceptable? Yes, because we haven't tested position 2 for I.

In ""TITLE"": positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:T, 4:L, 5:E.

I is in position 2, which is a new position to test.

Similarly, ""BIBLE"": 1:B, 2:I, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E.

But repeated B.

""LITHE""? L,I,T,H,E — positions: L(1), I(2), T(3), H(4), E(5). Yes, and no repeated letters.

""LITHE"" is a word (flexible or to warm with fire).

Also, ""WITHE""? W,I,T,H,E — similar.

But let's list available words.

Since I must be in position 1 or 2, and we have two options, we can choose one to test.

Option 1: I in position 1, e.g., INKLE: I,N,K,L,E

Option 2: I in position 2, e.g., TITLE: T,I,T,L,E (repeated T) or LITHE: L,I,T,H,E

We should avoid repeated letters if possible to get more information.

LITHE: L,I,T,H,E — all distinct except we don't know.

Another word: ""DINGE""? Not common.

""PIECE"" has E repeated? P,I,E,C,E — not 5 distinct? But allowed.

But E at position 3: if secret has only one E at 5, then position 3 E would be misplaced? But we don't know.

To avoid confusion, perhaps avoid putting E in other positions? But it's okay.

But let's choose LITHE: L,I,T,H,E

Or ""NICHE"": N,I,C,H,E — positions: N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5). I in position 2.

NICHE is a common word.

Similarly, ""BITCH""? Not appropriate, and ends with H? BITCH is B,I,T,C,H — not E.

""PIXIE""? P,I,X,I,E — repeated I? And ends with E? P(1),I(2),X(3),I(4),E(5) — but I repeated? And we don't know if secret has two I's? But we only know one I so far.

But PIXIE has I in position 2 and 4? We know position 4 is not possible for I? From MOVIE feedback, I was in position 4 and got -, so I is not in position 4. Therefore, if we put I in position 4 again, it would be wrong? But we are putting I in position 2? In PIXIE, we have I in position 2 and 4. Position 4 I would be incorrect since we know I not in 4? So it would get x? But that doesn't help, and we waste a letter.

So better to avoid multiple I's? Or at least avoid position 4 for I.

Therefore, NICHE: N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5) — I only in position 2.

Similarly, LITHE: L(1), I(2), T(3), H(4), E(5)

Both are good.

Now, which one to choose? We can pick based on letter frequency to cover more common letters.

Common consonants: T, N, L, C, etc.

NICHE has N, C, H.

LITHE has L, T, H.

T and N are very common.

Perhaps LITHE to include T.

But let's see the first option: INKLE with I in position 1: I,N,K,L,E — letters N,K,L.

K is less common.

So for position 2, LITHE or NICHE.

I'll go with LITHE to test T and L.

So guess: LITHE.

But let's confirm: LITHE is a valid word? Yes.

Feedback will tell us:
- If I is in position 2: if correct, we get ✓ for I at 2; if not, then I must be in position 1 (since we know it's not 3 or 4).
- Also, feedback on L, T, H.

If I is not in position 2, then it must be in position 1, and we can adjust next guess.

So <guess>LITHE</guess>

But we have to output in the format.

Thinking: we could also consider ""WHILE""? W,H,I,L,E — positions: W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5) — but I in position 3? Avoid.

No, so LITHE is better.

Another: ""THINE""? T,H,I,N,E — positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) — I in position 3? Avoid.

So LITHE seems good.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: RAISE → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)**  
  - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
  - I is in the word but not in position 3.
  - R, A, and S are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: MOVIE → Feedback: M(x) O(x) V(x) I(-) E(✓)**  
  - E is confirmed at position 5 (no change).
  - I is still misplaced, so it cannot be in position 4 (since it was guessed there and marked as wrong position).
  - M, O, and V are not in the word.

### Key Deductions:
1. **E is fixed at position 5**.
2. **I must be in the word but not in positions 3 or 4**. Therefore, it must be in position 1 or 2.
3. **Excluded letters**: R, A, S, M, O, V (all marked as ""x"" in feedback).
4. **Available letters**: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (and I, E, which are known to be present).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- The word must end with E (position 5).
- I must be included in position 1 or 2 to test its correct placement.
- Avoid excluded letters (R, A, S, M, O, V).
- Use new common letters (e.g., T, L, H, N) to maximize information gain.
- **Chosen word: LITHE** (meaning flexible, supple, or to warm with fire).
  - Pattern: `_ I _ _ E` (I in position 2).
  - Letters: L (position 1), I (position 2), T (position 3), H (position 4), E (position 5).
  - Why LITHE?
    - Tests I in position 2: If I is correct here, we get a ✓; if not, I must be in position 1 (since positions 3 and 4 are ruled out).
    - Introduces new common consonants (L, T, H) to check for presence/absence.
    - Avoids excluded letters and uses distinct letters for better feedback.

No. So OLIVE: positions: O in 1, L in 2, I in 3, V in 4, E in 5.\n\nBut wait, our feedback says I was misplaced in position 3. In ""RAISE"" we had I in position 3 and feedback said wrong position. So in the secret word, position 3 is not I. But in OLIVE, we are putting I in position 3 again? That would be the same position? It could be that the secret word doesn\'t have I in position 3, but we don\'t know if I is in another position. If I use OLIVE and put I in position 3 again, if in the actual word I is in position 3, we get conflicting feedback? But no: our feedback already says position 3 is wrong for I, so we must not put I in position 3 again.\n\nTherefore, in OLIVE, if I put I in position 3, that would be trying the same position where we know it doesn\'t belong? No, the feedback said - for I, meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So wherever I is, it\'s not 3. Therefore, in our new guess, if we put I in position 3 and it gets -, it means still wrong position? But we already know it\'s not 3? Actually, we shouldn\'t put I in position 3 at all because we know it\'s incorrect for that position.\n\nSo for OLIVE, I is at position 3, which we know is wrong. Therefore, if we guess OLIVE, the feedback for I will be again \'-\' or possibly \'✓\'? But we don\'t know where I is. It\'s inefficient to try I in position 3 again when we know it\'s incorrect.\n\nSo a better strategy is to try I in a different position. Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.\n\nTherefore, words like:\n- Position 1: I _ _ _ E -> e.g., IMAGE (but has A, excluded), INKLE (I,N,K,L,E), but INKLE is a word? Yes. Or IVORY? But not ending with E? Ivory ends with Y, no.\n\nIMAGE is invalid because it contains A, which is excluded.\n\nINKLE: I, N, K, L, E. That is: I in pos1, N in pos2, K in pos3, L in pos4, E in pos5. This avoids R,A,S, and puts I in a new position? Previously I was in pos3, now pos1.\n\nSimilarly, position 2: _ I _ _ E -> e.g., TIGER, but TIGER has T,I,G,E,R? R is excluded. Words with I in second position: LIKE, FINE, WIPE, etc.\n\nLIKE: L,I,K,E — but that\'s only 4 letters? LIKE has 4 letters. We need 5 letters. So ""OLIVE"" with I in position 3 is bad because of position.\n\nAnother position 4: _ _ _ I E -> that would be like .. I E at end. E is already at end. So words ending with IE? Like MOVIE, COTIE? But MOVIE is M,O,V,I,E — has I in position 4.\n\nAlso, we don\'t know about the other letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- Ending in E, excluding R,A,S, have I in position 1,2, or 4.\n\nPosition 1: \n- INDEX: I,N,D,E,X? E at end, and positions: I(1), N(2), D(3), E(4), X(5)? Not ending with E? INDEX ends with X. We need last letter E.\n\nWord must end in E. Any word with E at the 5th position.\n\nSo position 1: I? Start with I and end with E: e.g., IMAGE (invalid: A), ISLE? But ISLE ends with E? S is excluded. INLINE? Not 5 letters.\n\nICE? Too short.\n\nLook for 5-letter words: IVOTE? Not a word.\n\nIRENE? But has R (excluded, since R was x).\n\nSo IRENE invalid.\n\nIGLOE? Not standard. \n\nIDE? Too short.\n\nPerhaps ""INURE""? But has R? And U,N,E? INURE: I(1), N(2), U(3), R(4), E(5) — R is present? But R is excluded (feedback said x for R). So INURE has R, which is bad.\n\nAnother one: ""ILIKE""? Not a word.\n\nPosition 2: \n- LIGHT? Ends with T. Not E.\n\nMIDGE? M,I,D,G,E — ends with E? No, MIDGE is M,I,D,G,E? That would be E at end? Positions: 1:M, 2:I, 3:D, 4:G, 5:E. Yes, MIDGE is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""TITLE"" ends with E? T,I,T,L,E — T at 5 would be E? Positions: 1:T,2:I,3:T,4:L,5:E — yes.\n\nBut TITLE has T appearing twice? Also, we don\'t care about repetition? It\'s allowed, but the secret word might have duplicate letters? Feedback doesn\'t distinguish that? From rules, the feedback is per letter in the word, but duplicate letters: the feedback will mark the occurrences correctly? For example, if secret has two Ts, and guess has one T, it might be inconsistent? But for now, let\'s assume no duplicates? Not necessarily.\n\nSimilarly, ""MINCE"" : M,I,N,C,E.\n\n""BIBLE"" : B,I,B,L,E — B repeated.\n\nPosition 4: e.g., MOVIE: M,O,V,I,E — so I in position 4.\n\n""MOVIE"" has I in position 4, which is a new position? Previously was position 3.\n\nIn our first guess, E was at position 5 and was correct. So for MOVIE, E is position 5? Positions: 1:M, 2:O, 3:V, 4:I, 5:E — yes, E at 5.\n\nAlso, MOVIE does not have R, A, S? M,O,V,I,E — all new letters? Except E, which we know.\n\nMoreover, I is included, so we can see if I is in position 4 or not.\n\nSo possible candidates:\n- Position 1: hard to find words without R,A,S. INKLE? I(1),N(2),K(3),L(4),E(5) — yes, and INKLE is a word (a type of thread).\n- Position 2: MIDGE (M,I,D,G,E), TITLE (T,I,T,L,E), ALIKE? But A is excluded? ALIKE has A? So no. LIEGE? L,I,E,G,E — but E is repeated? And in our guess, positions: 1:L,2:I,3:? — LIEGE is L,I,E,G,E — positions: 1:L,2:I,3:E,4:G,5:E. E at position 3 and 5? But E is in the word already at 5? In secret, we know E is only at 5? We don\'t know if E is elsewhere? For example, the secret could have multiple E\'s? So LIEGE might be okay, but it has E in position 3 as well? So if we guess LIEGE, position 3 E: if secret has E only at 5, position 3 E would be incorrect? And E at 5 is correct.\n\nBut let me check: we know E is at position 5. We don\'t know if E is elsewhere? It could be.\n\nSo LIEGE: has E at 3 and 5. Letter E: if secret has E only at 5, then position 3 E would be feedback \'-\' or \'x\'? Since E is in the word but not at position 3, it should be \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly for other positions.\n\nBut to keep it simple, for position 2 candidates:\n- MIDGE: M,I,D,G,E\n- TITLE: T,I,T,L,E — repeated T? \n- MINCE: M,I,N,C,E — \n- BIBLE: B,I,B,L,E — repeated B\n\nPosition 4: MOVIE, or other words: OXIDE? But O,X,I,D,E — positions: 1:O,2:X,3:I,4:D,5:E? OXIDE has I in position 3? Not position 4. OXIDE: O(1),X(2),I(3),D(4),E(5) — that has I in position 3? We don\'t want that since we know I not in position 3.\n\nMOVIE: M(1),O(2),V(3),I(4),E(5) — I is in position 4.\n\nSo that\'s good.\n\nPossible guesses: MIDGE, MINCE, MOVIE, INKLE, etc.\n\nWe also want to cover new letters. Since we have few known letters (only E and I), we should use more common new letters to test.\n\nLet me prioritize: MOVIE uses M,O,V,I,E. I is known, E is confirmed. M,O,V are new.\n\nMIDGE: M,I,D,G,E — similar.\n\nINKLE: I,N,K,L,E — N,K,L new.\n\nConsidering letter frequencies: in remaining consonants, common ones include N, T, L, etc. But T is not excluded yet? From feedback, we only know R,A,S excluded. Letters we haven\'t used: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWe want to include several of these.\n\nMoreover, we want to put I in a new position to test where it is.\n\nCurrently available positions: 1,2,4 (since 3 is known wrong for I, and 5 is E).\n\nSo let\'s try position 4: MOVIE has I in position 4.\n\nIf we guess MOVIE, feedback:\n- If I is actually in position 4, then it would be ✓ for I at position 4?\n- If not, then - or x? Since we know I is in the word somewhere, if not position 4, it would be \'-\' and we know it must be in 1 or 2.\n\nPerhaps that\'s efficient.\n\nSimilarly, MOVIE is a common word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MOIRE""? But OIRE? MOIRE: M,O,I,R,E — has R? R is excluded? We cannot use R because feedback said R not in word. R was x, so MOIRE invalid because of R.\n\nSo MOVIE: valid? Moves in the game exist? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRIME""? But P,R,I,M,E — R excluded? No, R is not allowed.\n\nSo MOVIE seems fine.\n\nSimilarly, ""NINJA""? But not ends with E? And no E? Must end with E.\n\nAnother: ""WHINE""? W,H,I,N,E — positions: W1, H2, I3, N4, E5? But I is in position 3, which we should avoid? Since we don\'t want position 3.\n\nIf I want to test position 2: ""MINCE"" is M,I,N,C,E — I in position 2.\n\n""MIDGE"": M,I,D,G,E — I in position 2.\n\nPosition 1: INKLE: I,N,K,L,E — I in position 1.\n\nLet\'s choose between these.\n\nPerhaps try to include consonants that are common: T, L, N, etc. but MOVIE doesn\'t have T or L.\n\nTo gather more information, perhaps a word with more new common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: T, N, L, O, U, etc.\n\nSo ""TILE"" is 4 letters.\n\n""AMINE""? But A excluded.\n\n""ELIDE""? E,L,I,D,E — ends with E? Positions: E1, L2, I3, D4, E5. But E in position 1? We don\'t know if E is elsewhere? And I in position 3? We shouldn\'t put I in position 3. Also, E at position 1: if secret E is only at 5, then position 1 E would be \'-\' (since E is present elsewhere) or \'x\'? Not sure: if secret has only one E, and E is at 5, then position 1 E would be \'-\', meaning in the word but wrong position? But E is at 5 already? Feedback checks each letter independently? Actually, the Wordle rules: if you have duplicates in guess, the feedback accounts for duplicates in secret? For example, if secret has one E and guess has two E\'s, one might be yellow and one green? But in this case, if secret has only E at position 5, guess has E at position 1 and 5: position 5 is ✓, position 1 is \'-\' because E is present at position 5? But actually, that\'s correct? Yes.\n\nIn ELIDE, guess E at position 1: assuming secret has E at 5, not at 1, it would be \'-\' because E exists in the word elsewhere? Exactly like Wordle rules.\n\nBut we don\'t know if secret has E twice or not.\n\nSo ELIDE: positions: 1:E, 2:L, 3:I, 4:D, 5:E — but I is in position 3? Avoid position 3.\n\nSo ELIDE not good for that reason.\n\nInstead, words like MOVIE (I at position 4) or MIDGE (I at position 2).\n\nI think MOVIE is a good candidate.\n\nOr perhaps ""BICE"" not 5 letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""CHIME"" — C,H,I,M,E — positions: C1, H2, I3, M4, E5. Again, I in position 3? Avoid.\n\n""PHONE""? Ends with E? P,H,O,N,E — no I? We must contain I? Because we know I is in the word? From feedback, I is in the word (since \'-\' in RAISE), so our new guess must contain I? Not necessarily? But if we don\'t include I, we don\'t get information about it? That would be wasteful. Since we know I is present, we should include it to find its position.\n\nSo yes, the new guess must include I.\n\nTherefore, MOVIE: has I at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, ""QUITE""? Q,U,I,T,E — positions: Q1,U2,I3,T4,E5 — I in position 3 again? Avoid.\n\n""ABIDE"" has A, excluded.\n\nSo MOVIE seems a reasonable choice.\n\nMIDGE is good too? MIDGE: positions:1:M,2:I,3:D,4:G,5:E.\n\nI in position 2.\n\nIn terms of commonality, MOVIE might be better.\n\nBut let\'s decide: MOVIE.\n\nSo I\'ll guess MOVIE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R is not in the word (x).\n- A is not in the word (x).\n- I is in the word but not in position 3 (-).\n- S is not in the word (x).\n- E is in the word and in position E(✓).\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word must contain E in position 5.\n- The letter I must be present, but not in position 3.\n- The letters R, A, and S are absent and should be avoided in future guesses.\n- Possible positions for I are 1, 2, or 4 (since position 3 is incorrect and position 5 is occupied by E).\n- The next guess should end with E, include I in an untested position (1, 2, or 4), and exclude R, A, and S to gather more information about other letters.\n\nFor this guess, ""MOVIE"" is chosen because:\n- It ends with E, maintaining the known correct position.\n- It places I in position 4 (a new, untested position to potentially identify the correct position of I).\n- It includes new common letters (M, O, V) to test their presence or absence.\n- It avoids R, A, and S.\n\nIf I is in position 4 of the secret word, this will give a correct position (✓); if not, it might show as misplaced (-), narrowing I\'s possible locations to position 1 or 2. Feedback on M, O, and V will help constrain future guesses.\n\n<guess>MOVIE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: MOVIE -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) V(x) I(-) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- I: - (in word, wrong position)\n- S: x (not in word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position)\n\nGuess 2: MOVIE\n- M: x (not in word)\n- O: x (not in word)\n- V: x (not in word)\n- I: - (in word, wrong position) — note: this is the second time I is misplaced, so it\'s not in position 3 or 4.\n- E: ✓ (correct position, which we already knew)\n\nDeductions so far:\n1. E is in position 5 and is correct.\n2. I is in the word but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 4 (from second guess). Therefore, I must be in position 1 or 2.\n3. The following letters are not in the word: R, A, S, M, O, V.\n\nWe need to make a new guess that:\n- Ends with E (position 5).\n- Contains I in either position 1 or 2 (since it can\'t be in 3 or 4, and 5 is E).\n- Avoids the letters R, A, S, M, O, V.\n\nAdditionally, we should try to cover new common letters to get more information.\n\nPossible positions for I:\n- Position 1: I _ _ _ E\n- Position 2: _ I _ _ E\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and uses only letters not yet excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: R, A, S, M, O, V.\n\nAvailable letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, U, W, X, Y, Z (and I, E which are known present).\n\nWe should aim for a word that has I in position 1 or 2 and uses common letters to maximize information.\n\nLet\'s consider position 1: I _ _ _ E\nPossible words: \n- ILLEGAL? Too long, 6 letters.\n- IMBUE? Not ending with E.\n- IGNORE? Has O and R, excluded.\n- IMAGE? Has A and M, excluded.\n- INANE? Has A, excluded.\n- INKLE: I, N, K, L, E — all available? Yes: I(1), N(2), K(3), L(4), E(5). INKLE is a word (a type of thread or to mend with thread).\n\nPosition 2: _ I _ _ E\nExamples:\n- TITLE: T(1), I(2), T(3), L(4), E(5) — but T is repeated? And we don\'t know if T is in the word. Also, T is available.\n- BIBLE: B(1), I(2), B(3), L(4), E(5) — B repeated.\n- PIECE: P(1), I(2), E(3), C(4), E(5) — E repeated? And E at position 3: we know E is at 5, but it might be elsewhere? But we don\'t know.\n- DICE? 4 letters.\n- LIGHT? Not ending with E.\n- WIPED? W(1), I(2), P(3), E(4), D(5) — but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. So not.\n- Must end with E: so _ I _ _ E.\n\nMore words: \n- TIGER? Has R, excluded.\n- LIVER? Has R, excluded.\n- WIDEN? Not ending with E.\n- MINCE? Has M, excluded.\n- DANCE? Has A? D,A,N,C,E — A is excluded? Yes, A is not allowed.\n- PIQUE? P,I,Q,U,E — ends with E? Positions: P(1), I(2), Q(3), U(4), E(5). But Q and U are less common, but possible.\n\nAnother: ""BIGOT""? Not ending with E.\n\n""FILET""? F,I,L,E,T — ends with T, not E.\n\n""GUISE""? G,U,I,S,E — but S is excluded? S is not allowed.\n\n""QUITE""? Q,U,I,T,E — positions: Q(1), U(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) — but I is in position 3? We cannot put I in position 3 because we know it\'s not there? From previous feedback, I is not in position 3 or 4. So in QUITE, I is in position 3, which is invalid? We should avoid position 3 for I.\n\nSimilarly, for position 1 pattern: INKLE (I in 1) or for position 2: we need a word with I in 2 and E in 5.\n\nAnother word: ""ALIKE""? But A is excluded.\n\n""GLIDE""? G,L,I,D,E — positions: G(1), L(2), I(3), D(4), E(5) — I in position 3? Avoid.\n\n""WHITE""? W,H,I,T,E — positions: W(1), H(2), I(3), T(4), E(5) — again I in 3? Avoid.\n\nSo for position 2, we need a word where I is in position 2 and the third letter is not I? But the pattern is _ I _ _ E, so I is in position 2, and the third and fourth are other letters.\n\nBut we don\'t want to put I in position 3? In this pattern, I is only in position 2, so that\'s fine. The issue is that we are not putting I in position 3. For example, ""TITLE"" has I in position 2, which is acceptable? Yes, because we haven\'t tested position 2 for I.\n\nIn ""TITLE"": positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:T, 4:L, 5:E.\n\nI is in position 2, which is a new position to test.\n\nSimilarly, ""BIBLE"": 1:B, 2:I, 3:B, 4:L, 5:E.\n\nBut repeated B.\n\n""LITHE""? L,I,T,H,E — positions: L(1), I(2), T(3), H(4), E(5). Yes, and no repeated letters.\n\n""LITHE"" is a word (flexible or to warm with fire).\n\nAlso, ""WITHE""? W,I,T,H,E — similar.\n\nBut let\'s list available words.\n\nSince I must be in position 1 or 2, and we have two options, we can choose one to test.\n\nOption 1: I in position 1, e.g., INKLE: I,N,K,L,E\n\nOption 2: I in position 2, e.g., TITLE: T,I,T,L,E (repeated T) or LITHE: L,I,T,H,E\n\nWe should avoid repeated letters if possible to get more information.\n\nLITHE: L,I,T,H,E — all distinct except we don\'t know.\n\nAnother word: ""DINGE""? Not common.\n\n""PIECE"" has E repeated? P,I,E,C,E — not 5 distinct? But allowed.\n\nBut E at position 3: if secret has only one E at 5, then position 3 E would be misplaced? But we don\'t know.\n\nTo avoid confusion, perhaps avoid putting E in other positions? But it\'s okay.\n\nBut let\'s choose LITHE: L,I,T,H,E\n\nOr ""NICHE"": N,I,C,H,E — positions: N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5). I in position 2.\n\nNICHE is a common word.\n\nSimilarly, ""BITCH""? Not appropriate, and ends with H? BITCH is B,I,T,C,H — not E.\n\n""PIXIE""? P,I,X,I,E — repeated I? And ends with E? P(1),I(2),X(3),I(4),E(5) — but I repeated? And we don\'t know if secret has two I\'s? But we only know one I so far.\n\nBut PIXIE has I in position 2 and 4? We know position 4 is not possible for I? From MOVIE feedback, I was in position 4 and got -, so I is not in position 4. Therefore, if we put I in position 4 again, it would be wrong? But we are putting I in position 2? In PIXIE, we have I in position 2 and 4. Position 4 I would be incorrect since we know I not in 4? So it would get x? But that doesn\'t help, and we waste a letter.\n\nSo better to avoid multiple I\'s? Or at least avoid position 4 for I.\n\nTherefore, NICHE: N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5) — I only in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, LITHE: L(1), I(2), T(3), H(4), E(5)\n\nBoth are good.\n\nNow, which one to choose? We can pick based on letter frequency to cover more common letters.\n\nCommon consonants: T, N, L, C, etc.\n\nNICHE has N, C, H.\n\nLITHE has L, T, H.\n\nT and N are very common.\n\nPerhaps LITHE to include T.\n\nBut let\'s see the first option: INKLE with I in position 1: I,N,K,L,E — letters N,K,L.\n\nK is less common.\n\nSo for position 2, LITHE or NICHE.\n\nI\'ll go with LITHE to test T and L.\n\nSo guess: LITHE.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: LITHE is a valid word? Yes.\n\nFeedback will tell us:\n- If I is in position 2: if correct, we get ✓ for I at 2; if not, then I must be in position 1 (since we know it\'s not 3 or 4).\n- Also, feedback on L, T, H.\n\nIf I is not in position 2, then it must be in position 1, and we can adjust next guess.\n\nSo <guess>LITHE</guess>\n\nBut we have to output in the format.\n\nThinking: we could also consider ""WHILE""? W,H,I,L,E — positions: W(1), H(2), I(3), L(4), E(5) — but I in position 3? Avoid.\n\nNo, so LITHE is better.\n\nAnother: ""THINE""? T,H,I,N,E — positions: T(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), E(5) — I in position 3? Avoid.\n\nSo LITHE seems good.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: RAISE → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)**  \n  - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.\n  - I is in the word but not in position 3.\n  - R, A, and S are not in the word.\n\n- **Guess 2: MOVIE → Feedback: M(x) O(x) V(x) I(-) E(✓)**  \n  - E is confirmed at position 5 (no change).\n  - I is still misplaced, so it cannot be in position 4 (since it was guessed there and marked as wrong position).\n  - M, O, and V are not in the word.\n\n### Key Deductions:\n1. **E is fixed at position 5**.\n2. **I must be in the word but not in positions 3 or 4**.

We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x (absent)
- A: x (absent)
- I: - (present, but wrong position; not position 3)
- S: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct position; so position 5 is E)

Guess 2: MOVIE
- M: x (absent)
- O: x (absent)
- V: x (absent)
- I: - (present, but wrong position; so not position 4)
- E: ✓ (confirmed position 5)

Guess 3: LITHE
- L: x (absent)
- I: ✓ (correct position; so position 2 is I)
- T: x (absent)
- H: ✓ (correct position; so position 4 is H)
- E: ✓ (correct position; position 5 is E)

Now, from the feedback of LITHE, we have:
- I is in position 2 (correct, so we know position 2 is I)
- H is in position 4 (correct, so position 4 is H)
- E is in position 5 (confirmed)
- L and T are absent (so not in the word)

Also, from previous feedback, we know:
- R, A, S, M, O, V are absent.

So, the secret word has the form: _ I _ H E

We know the letters in positions 2, 4, and 5: I, H, E.

We need to find the first and third letters.

Known absent letters: R, A, S, M, O, V, L, T.

Also, from the first guess, I was present but not in position 3. Now we know it's in position 2, so that's consistent.

We need to find:
- Position 1: missing letter
- Position 3: missing letter

The word is: [letter1] I [letter3] H E

We know that the secret word must be a valid English word.

We also know that the letter in position 3 cannot be I (since I is in position 2, and if it were duplicated, we might have feedback about that? But in LITHE, we only had one I, so we don't know about duplicates. However, from the feedback of RAISE, I was present and not in position 3, and now we have I in position 2, so position 3 is a different letter.

Similarly, we must avoid the absent letters.

So, available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and we know I, H, E are present, but we are only missing two letters).

We need to form a word of the pattern _ I _ H E.

Possible words:

- WITHE? But W is available, but WITHE is W,I,T,H,E — but T is absent? From LITHE, T is absent, so T cannot be used. So WITHE has T, which is bad.

- Other words: let's think of common words.

- ""BITHE"" — not a word.

- ""SITHE"" — archaic for scythe? But S is absent? S was in RAISE and marked absent, so no.

- ""NICHE"" — N,I,C,H,E — positions: N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5). But in our pattern, position 3 is C? And we have no feedback on C yet.

But in NICHE, the third letter is C.

Similarly, ""DICHE"" not a word.

""FICHE"" — F,I,C,H,E — fiche, like microfiche? Yes.

""PICHE"" not common.

""RICHE"" — R is absent.

""WICHE"" not a word.

""BICHE"" not English.

So possible: NICHE, FICHE.

Also, ""DICE"" is 4 letters.

""PIECE"" — P,I,E,C,E — but E at position 3? Pattern requires position 3 to be a letter and then H at 4? PIECE has no H.

We need H at position 4.

So only a few options: NICHE, FICHE.

Also, ""WITHE"" has T, absent.

""KITHE"" — archaic, meaning to make known? But K,I,T,H,E — T absent.

""LITHE"" we already guessed, and L and T absent.

Another: ""MITHE"" not a word.

""QUICHE"" — Q,U,I,C,H,E — that's 6 letters? Quiche is 6 letters? Q-U-I-C-H-E, that's 6. No, 5: Q-U-I-C-H? No, QUICHE is Q-U-I-C-H-E, 6 letters? Let me count: Q, U, I, C, H, E — 6. So too long.

""BICHE"" not word.

So likely candidates: NICHE and FICHE.

But FICHE is less common? But acceptable.

Also, ""DICHY"" not ending with E.

We might have ""WITHY"" but ends with Y, not E.

So let's list:

- NICHE: N, I, C, H, E
- FICHE: F, I, C, H, E

We need to choose one. Since we have two possibilities, we can guess one to see.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, I was misplaced, but now we know it's in position 2, so that's fine.

We don't have any other information about N, C, F.

So we can guess NICHE, for example.

But let's see if there are more words.

""ZINC"" not ending with E.

""PINCE"" not a word.

""WINCE"" — W,I,N,C,E — but no H? We need H at position 4. WINCE is W,I,N,C,E — positions: W1, I2, N3, C4, E5 — but we need position 4 to be H, so not.

Similarly, ""MINCE"" has M, absent.

So only NICHE and FICHE seem to fit the pattern and avoid absent letters.

Another: ""RICHE"" has R, absent.

""BICHE"" not English.

""TICHE"" not a word.

So I think NICHE and FICHE are the main options.

Perhaps ""ICH"" something, but not.

We can guess NICHE.

But to be thorough, let's see the feedback we can get.

If we guess NICHE:
- If the word is NICHE, we win.
- If not, then it must be FICHE, and we can guess that next.

Since we have only two options, we can choose one.

But we have 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4, so we can afford to guess.

Perhaps we can think if there is another word.

""GICHE"" not a word.

""VICHE"" not.

So I think NICHE is a good guess.

But let's confirm the pattern: position 1: ?, position 2: I, position 3: ?, position 4: H, position 5: E.

NICHE: N in 1, I in 2, C in 3, H in 4, E in 5. Matches.

FICHE: F in 1, I in 2, C in 3, H in 4, E in 5.

So both have C in position 3? In both cases, position 3 is C? Then why are there two words? No, the words are different in position 1: N vs F.

But position 3 is C in both? So if we guess NICHE and it's wrong, then position 1 is not N, and position 3 might be C or not? But in FICHE, position 3 is also C.

So if we guess NICHE and the word is FICHE, then feedback would be:
- N: x (absent, since F is there)
- I: ✓ (correct)
- C: ? 
- H: ✓
- E: ✓

But C: if position 3 is C, then it would be ✓? But in FICHE, position 3 is C, so if we guess NICHE, which has C in position 3, and if the secret is FICHE, then C is in the word and in position 3, so it should be ✓ for C.

Similarly, if the secret has C in position 3, then in NICHE, C would be correct.

But we don't know if position 3 is C or not.

In our pattern, we don't know position 3.

But in both candidate words, position 3 is C. So is there a word with a different letter in position 3?

For example, is there a word like ""DI?HE"" with something else?

""BIGHT""? Not E.

""FIGHT""? Not E.

""LIGHT"" not E.

""PIGHT"" not common.

""RIGHT"" not E.

""SIGHT"" not E.

""TIGHT"" not E.

""WIGHT"" not E.

""ZITHER"" too long.

""KITHE"" has T, absent.

So I think only NICHE and FICHE are the possibilities, both with C in position 3.

Therefore, position 3 must be C.

Is that possible? Then why two options? Because position 1 is different.

But we need to confirm if there are other words.

What about ""DICHE""? Not a word.

""WICHE"" not.

""MICHE"" — M is absent.

So yes, only two possibilities: NICHE and FICHE.

Therefore, we can guess NICHE.

If it's not, then FICHE.

But let's see the feedback from LITHE: we have I, H, E correct, and L and T absent.

So for the next guess, we can do NICHE.

So <guess>NICHE</guess>

But to be safe, let's think: is there a word like ""ICH"" but no.

Another: ""HIC"" not.

So I think it's fine.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: 
     - R, A, S are absent (x).
     - I is present but not in position 3 (-).
     - E is correct at position 5 (✓).
   - **Guess 2 (MOVIE)**:
     - M, O, V are absent (x).
     - I is present but not in position 4 (-).
     - E is confirmed at position 5 (✓).
   - **Guess 3 (LITHE)**:
     - L and T are absent (x).
     - I is correct at position 2 (✓).
     - H is correct at position 4 (✓).
     - E is confirmed at position 5 (✓).

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 2: I (from LITHE feedback).
     - Position 4: H (from LITHE feedback).
     - Position 5: E (consistent across all guesses).
   - **Absent Letters**: R, A, S, M, O, V, L, T (all marked ""x"" in feedback).
   - **Word Pattern**: The secret word must be of the form `_ I _ H E`, where:
     - The first blank (position 1) and third blank (position 3) are unknown letters.
     - These unknown letters must be from the remaining available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (since all absent letters are excluded).
   - **Constraints on Position 3**: 
     - I cannot be in position 3 (from RAISE feedback), but since I is fixed at position 2, position 3 must be a different letter.
     - No duplicates of H or E are indicated yet, but feedback doesn't rule them out.

3. **Identify Possible Words**:
   - The pattern `_ I _ H E` limits possible words. Common English words fitting this pattern include:
     - **NICHE**: Positions: N (1), I (2), C (3), H (4), E (5).
     - **FICHE**: Positions: F (1), I (2), C (3), H (4), E (5).
   - Both words share the same letters in positions 2–5 (I, C, H, E), differing only in position 1 (N vs. F).
   - Other words (e.g., WITHE, KITHE) are invalid due to absent letters (T) or incorrect endings.
   - Since only two candidates exist, guessing one will resolve the word:
     - If NICHE is correct, the game ends.
     - If NICHE is incorrect, FICHE must be the word (and we can guess it next).

4. **Strategy for This Guess**:
   - **Why guess NICHE?** 
     - It tests the most common word first (NICHE is more frequent than FICHE in English).
     - It uses new letters (N, C) to gather feedback on position 1 and 3.
     - Feedback will confirm or deny N and C:
       - If N is correct (✓), position 1 is solved.
       - If N is absent (x), position 1 must be F (for FICHE).
       - C in position 3 is shared by both candidates, so if C is correct (✓), it confirms position 3 for either word. If C is misplaced (-) or absent (x), it would contradict both candidates, but this is unlikely given the pattern.
   - **Efficiency**: With only 2 options, this guess maximizes the chance to solve the word in 4 guesses.

<guess>NICHE</guess>",NICHE,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: x (absent)
- A: x (absent)
- I: - (present, but wrong position; not position 3)
- S: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct position; so position 5 is E)

Guess 2: MOVIE
- M: x (absent)
- O: x (absent)
- V: x (absent)
- I: - (present, but wrong position; so not position 4)
- E: ✓ (confirmed position 5)

Guess 3: LITHE
- L: x (absent)
- I: ✓ (correct position; so position 2 is I)
- T: x (absent)
- H: ✓ (correct position; so position 4 is H)
- E: ✓ (correct position; position 5 is E)

Now, from the feedback of LITHE, we have:
- I is in position 2 (correct, so we know position 2 is I)
- H is in position 4 (correct, so position 4 is H)
- E is in position 5 (confirmed)
- L and T are absent (so not in the word)

Also, from previous feedback, we know:
- R, A, S, M, O, V are absent.

So, the secret word has the form: _ I _ H E

We know the letters in positions 2, 4, and 5: I, H, E.

We need to find the first and third letters.

Known absent letters: R, A, S, M, O, V, L, T.

Also, from the first guess, I was present but not in position 3. Now we know it's in position 2, so that's consistent.

We need to find:
- Position 1: missing letter
- Position 3: missing letter

The word is: [letter1] I [letter3] H E

We know that the secret word must be a valid English word.

We also know that the letter in position 3 cannot be I (since I is in position 2, and if it were duplicated, we might have feedback about that? But in LITHE, we only had one I, so we don't know about duplicates. However, from the feedback of RAISE, I was present and not in position 3, and now we have I in position 2, so position 3 is a different letter.

Similarly, we must avoid the absent letters.

So, available letters: B, C, D, F, G, J, K, N, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z (and we know I, H, E are present, but we are only missing two letters).

We need to form a word of the pattern _ I _ H E.

Possible words:

- WITHE? But W is available, but WITHE is W,I,T,H,E — but T is absent? From LITHE, T is absent, so T cannot be used. So WITHE has T, which is bad.

- Other words: let's think of common words.

- ""BITHE"" — not a word.

- ""SITHE"" — archaic for scythe? But S is absent? S was in RAISE and marked absent, so no.

- ""NICHE"" — N,I,C,H,E — positions: N(1), I(2), C(3), H(4), E(5). But in our pattern, position 3 is C? And we have no feedback on C yet.

But in NICHE, the third letter is C.

Similarly, ""DICHE"" not a word.

""FICHE"" — F,I,C,H,E — fiche, like microfiche? Yes.

""PICHE"" not common.

""RICHE"" — R is absent.

""WICHE"" not a word.

""BICHE"" not English.

So possible: NICHE, FICHE.

Also, ""DICE"" is 4 letters.

""PIECE"" — P,I,E,C,E — but E at position 3? Pattern requires position 3 to be a letter and then H at 4? PIECE has no H.

We need H at position 4.

So only a few options: NICHE, FICHE.

Also, ""WITHE"" has T, absent.

""KITHE"" — archaic, meaning to make known? But K,I,T,H,E — T absent.

""LITHE"" we already guessed, and L and T absent.

Another: ""MITHE"" not a word.

""QUICHE"" — Q,U,I,C,H,E — that's 6 letters? Quiche is 6 letters? Q-U-I-C-H-E, that's 6. No, 5: Q-U-I-C-H? No, QUICHE is Q-U-I-C-H-E, 6 letters? Let me count: Q, U, I, C, H, E — 6. So too long.

""BICHE"" not word.

So likely candidates: NICHE and FICHE.

But FICHE is less common? But acceptable.

Also, ""DICHY"" not ending with E.

We might have ""WITHY"" but ends with Y, not E.

So let's list:

- NICHE: N, I, C, H, E
- FICHE: F, I, C, H, E

We need to choose one. Since we have two possibilities, we can guess one to see.

But we also have to consider that in the first guess, I was misplaced, but now we know it's in position 2, so that's fine.

We don't have any other information about N, C, F.

So we can guess NICHE, for example.

But let's see if there are more words.

""ZINC"" not ending with E.

""PINCE"" not a word.

""WINCE"" — W,I,N,C,E — but no H? We need H at position 4. WINCE is W,I,N,C,E — positions: W1, I2, N3, C4, E5 — but we need position 4 to be H, so not.

Similarly, ""MINCE"" has M, absent.

So only NICHE and FICHE seem to fit the pattern and avoid absent letters.

Another: ""RICHE"" has R, absent.

""BICHE"" not English.

""TICHE"" not a word.

So I think NICHE and FICHE are the main options.

Perhaps ""ICH"" something, but not.

We can guess NICHE.

But to be thorough, let's see the feedback we can get.

If we guess NICHE:
- If the word is NICHE, we win.
- If not, then it must be FICHE, and we can guess that next.

Since we have only two options, we can choose one.

But we have 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4, so we can afford to guess.

Perhaps we can think if there is another word.

""GICHE"" not a word.

""VICHE"" not.

So I think NICHE is a good guess.

But let's confirm the pattern: position 1: ?, position 2: I, position 3: ?, position 4: H, position 5: E.

NICHE: N in 1, I in 2, C in 3, H in 4, E in 5. Matches.

FICHE: F in 1, I in 2, C in 3, H in 4, E in 5.

So both have C in position 3? In both cases, position 3 is C? Then why are there two words? No, the words are different in position 1: N vs F.

But position 3 is C in both? So if we guess NICHE and it's wrong, then position 1 is not N, and position 3 might be C or not? But in FICHE, position 3 is also C.

So if we guess NICHE and the word is FICHE, then feedback would be:
- N: x (absent, since F is there)
- I: ✓ (correct)
- C: ? 
- H: ✓
- E: ✓

But C: if position 3 is C, then it would be ✓? But in FICHE, position 3 is C, so if we guess NICHE, which has C in position 3, and if the secret is FICHE, then C is in the word and in position 3, so it should be ✓ for C.

Similarly, if the secret has C in position 3, then in NICHE, C would be correct.

But we don't know if position 3 is C or not.

In our pattern, we don't know position 3.

But in both candidate words, position 3 is C. So is there a word with a different letter in position 3?

For example, is there a word like ""DI?HE"" with something else?

""BIGHT""? Not E.

""FIGHT""? Not E.

""LIGHT"" not E.

""PIGHT"" not common.

""RIGHT"" not E.

""SIGHT"" not E.

""TIGHT"" not E.

""WIGHT"" not E.

""ZITHER"" too long.

""KITHE"" has T, absent.

So I think only NICHE and FICHE are the possibilities, both with C in position 3.

Therefore, position 3 must be C.

Is that possible? Then why two options? Because position 1 is different.

But we need to confirm if there are other words.

What about ""DICHE""? Not a word.

""WICHE"" not.

""MICHE"" — M is absent.

So yes, only two possibilities: NICHE and FICHE.

Therefore, we can guess NICHE.

If it's not, then FICHE.

But let's see the feedback from LITHE: we have I, H, E correct, and L and T absent.

So for the next guess, we can do NICHE.

So <guess>NICHE</guess>

But to be safe, let's think: is there a word like ""ICH"" but no.

Another: ""HIC"" not.

So I think it's fine.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
