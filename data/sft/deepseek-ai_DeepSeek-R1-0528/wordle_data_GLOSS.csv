We are making the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we need a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), and it's a well-regarded starting word.

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think about common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out, and sometimes Y, but Y is less common)
 Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the word.

 Some good starting words without the forbidden letters might be: ""SLOTH"", ""PIOUS"", ""BUILT"", etc.

 However, note that we have to avoid E and A, which are very common. So let's try to pick a word with other common letters.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, H, D, M, etc.

 We can try a word like ""SLOTH"": 
   S, L, O, T, H. But O is a vowel and we have it.

 Alternatively, ""PILOT"" uses P, I, L, O, T. But we have to check if any of these are forbidden? We know C,R,A,N,E are out, so PILOT is okay.

 However, we might also consider ""TOILS"" or ""MOIST"". 

 Another idea: ""BUMPY"" but that has Y and is less common.

 Let's list some words without C,R,A,N,E:
 - ""SLIPT"" (not common, and only 5 letters? Actually, ""SLIPT"" is not standard, better avoid)
 - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> all allowed and common.

 ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has common letters and two vowels (O and I) that we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, ""POUCH"" is not allowed because it has C? But C is forbidden, so no.

 Another word: ""LUMPS"" - L, U, M, P, S.

 But let's go with ""MOIST"" because it's a well-known word.

 So, next guess: ""moist""

I'll prioritize common remaining consonants (like S, T, L, M) and vowels (O, I, U) to maximize new information. A strong candidate is **""moist""**, as it:
- Uses frequent letters (M, O, I, S, T) not yet tested.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).

We have two sets of feedback:
1. From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E are all absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.
2. From ""moist"": 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: present but in wrong position (-)
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: correct and in the right position (✓) -> so the 4th letter of the secret word is S.
   - T: absent (x)

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have the letter O, but not in the second position (since in ""moist"" O is in second position and it's marked wrong position).
- The fourth letter is S.
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T (from both guesses).

Known absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Present letters: O is present (and we know it's not in position 2).

We also know the 4th letter is S.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has S as the 4th letter.
- Contains the letter O (but not in position 2).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Available letters: all except the absent ones. Note: we have used S and O (O is present). Also, we have not tested many letters yet.

List of available vowels: O (we know it's present), and U (since A, E, I are absent). Y might be used sometimes.

Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S (already used in one position), V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to think of words that end with S (since 4th letter is S, so the word is ? ? ? S ?).

Actually, the 4th letter is S, so the word has pattern: _ _ _ S _

With O somewhere, but not in position 2.

Also, since O is present and not in position 2, it can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Now, let's think of words that fit:

- First, the word must not have any of the forbidden letters.

Examples: 
- Could the word be ""FOCUS""? But FOCUS has F,O,C,U,S. However, C is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""JUMPS""? But JUMPS has U,M,P,S. M is forbidden -> invalid.
- We need to avoid M (absent) and others.

Another idea: ""POLES""? But E is forbidden -> invalid.

Alternative: ""GULPS""? G,U,L,P,S -> but let's check positions: 
Pattern: _ _ _ S _
If we put GULPS: G U L P S -> but the S is at the 5th? Wait, no: positions are:
1: G, 2: U, 3: L, 4: P? -> no, in GULPS, the letters are G,U,L,P,S so:
Position 1: G, position 2: U, position 3: L, position 4: P, position 5: S. But we need position 4 to be S, so pattern must be _ _ _ S _ meaning the fourth letter is S, so in GULPS the fourth letter is P (not S). So that doesn't work.

We need words that have S in the fourth position: so the word is ???S?

Examples: 
- BOLTS? But B,O,L,T,S -> T is forbidden? From guess 2, T is absent -> so T is forbidden. Invalid.
- DUCKS? D,U,C,K,S -> C is forbidden -> invalid.
- FLUBS? F,L,U,B,S -> but FLUBS may not be a word? Also, fourth letter must be S? In FLUBS: positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), B(4), S(5) -> but we need position 4 to be S? So no.

Actually, words with S in fourth position: 
- The fifth letter can be any, so words ending with two letters? But the fifth letter cannot be one of the forbidden ones.

Common words: 
- FOCUS is not because C and S is fifth?
- The pattern is X X X S Y, where X are the first three letters, Y the last.

Examples: 
- ""FOCUS"" -> positions: F(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), S(5) -> no, we need S in position 4.
- Words with S in the fourth position: like ""TRUSS"" -> T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5). But T and R are forbidden -> invalid.

Perhaps ""BUSKS"": B,U,S,K,S -> but positions: 
- Letter in position 4 would be K? BUSKS: 
  B(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> so position 4 is K, not S. 

We need the letter S exactly at position 4.

Common words: 
- ""GLASS"": G,L,A,S,S -> A is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""CLASS"": C forbidden -> invalid.
- ""GRASS"": G,R,A,S,S -> R and A forbidden -> invalid.
- ""BLESS"": B,L,E,S,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.
- ""PRESS"": P,R,E,S,S -> R,E forbidden -> invalid.

Other possibilities: 
- ""CROSS"": C forbidden -> invalid.
- ""FLOSS"": F,L,O,S,S -> 
  Positions: 
  1: F
  2: L
  3: O
  4: S
  5: S

Now, check forbidden letters: 
- F is not forbidden? Only absent letters are C,R,A,N,E,M,I,T. So F is allowed.
- L: allowed
- O: present, but we know O must be in the word. Here O is in position 3.
- S in position 4 and 5? But we have S only for position 4? Actually, we have two S's? The feedback for ""moist"" showed S in position 4 as correct, so we know only position 4 is S. But the secret word might contain another S? Feedback doesn't tell about duplicates unless guessed.

But ""moist"" had only one S, and it was in the correct position. So if the secret word has two S's, the feedback when guessing with two S's would show both.

We don't know if the secret word has another S? So ""FLOSS"" has two S's? It's possible? But let's check missing letters: ""FLOSS"": F, L, O, S, S. 

Does it avoid forbidden letters? Yes: no C,R,A,N,E,M,I,T.

Also, O is present and in position 3 (so not in position 2, as required).

This seems promising? But we don't know if there is another S. However, the feedback for ""moist"" didn't show any S in incorrect position because S was guessed in the fourth position and was correct. If the secret word had an S in another position, then when we guessed ""moist"" with S only in fourth, the feedback wouldn't show another S? Only shows the first occurrence? Actually, Wordle feedback accounts for duplicate letters appropriately.

Recall: the rules for duplicates:
- If the secret word has duplicate letters, then a guess must also include duplicates to account for them? Otherwise, the feedback will show only the presence based on the correct matches and then the wrong position for the extra? But it's tricky.

In our case, for ""moist"":
- The letter S was in position 4 and marked correct. That means that at least one S is in position 4. If the secret word has only one S, then any other S in the guess would be absent? But in ""moist"" we guessed only one S, so if the secret word has more S's, we wouldn't know? However, the feedback doesn't show the count beyond what is guessed? Actually, it does: for duplicates, it handles by matching correctly first, then the extras.

But in ""moist"", we had one S and it was correct. So if the secret word has two S's, then when we guess with only one S in position 4, we should get a yellow or green for the S? Only green for the position 4, and the other S? But we didn't guess it? So no feedback for the extra S.

Thus, it's possible that the secret word has two S's? And we wouldn't know until we guess a word with an extra S? But we will be guessing ""FLOSS"" so we can test that.

But let's see: ""FLOSS"" has O in position 3? So we can try that? But wait, we have to avoid forbidden letters: and FLOSS seems okay? But we also need to consider that we have only 5 tries? Actually, we can try to use known information.

Another idea: ""FLOGS"": F,L,O,G,S -> G is allowed? Then: 
 Positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:G? -> wait, we need position 4 to be S? Not G.

So to have pattern ???S? and the word must include O? And O not in position 2.

Another common word: ""DOWNS""? D,O,W,N,S -> but N is forbidden? From ""crane"", N is absent? So N is forbidden -> invalid.

""SHOWS""? S,H,O,W,S -> but then position 4 would be W? Not S.

How about ""BOUSS""? Not a word. 

Let me think differently: 

Possible words with S in the fourth position: 
- The word is ??X?S? where the fourth letter is S? Actually, positions: let the word be L1, L2, L3, L4=S, L5.

And we know L4 = S.

With O present? Not in position 2? So O can be L1, L3, or L5.

Now, try L1= O: then pattern O _ _ S _
Examples: ""OUPHS"" (not common), ""OAKS"" (only 4 letters), actually 5-letter words: ""OASIS"" -> O,A,S,I,S -> A and I are forbidden? A and I absent. -> invalid.

Then L3=O: pattern: _ _ O S _
Examples: ""ABOBS"" -> A forbidden. 
""WHOPS"" -> W,H,O,P,S -> positions: 
1: W, 2: H, 3: O, 4: P? -> wait, position 4 must be S? So if the word is WHOSS? Not a word. 
Or ""GHOST"": G,H,O,S,T -> T is forbidden? But wait, in ""moist"", T was in position 5? And marked absent? So T is forbidden -> ""GHOST"" invalid.

But ""GHOST"" has O in position 3? And S in position 4? Exactly? But T is forbidden -> cannot use.

Similarly, ""JUMPS"" has M and position 4 is P? -> not.

Then L5=O: pattern: _ _ _ S O
So the word ends with SO? Or S then O? Actually: first three letters any, then S, then O? So word ends with ""SO"".

Examples: ""LASSO"": L,A,S,S,O -> A forbidden? and also positions: 
L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5) -> so position 4 is the second S, which is correct? But letter count: A and S? 
But A forbidden -> invalid.

Another one: ""VISSO"" not valid.

Perhaps ""BUXOM"" -> no S.

I need to search for words with S in position 4 and O in the word but not in position 2.

One word that comes to mind: ""GROSS"" -> but G,R,O,S,S -> R forbidden -> invalid.

""BLISS"": B,L,I,S,S -> I forbidden -> invalid.

""PLUSH"": P,L,U,S,H -> then position 4 is S? 
Letters: P,L,U,S,H -> positions: 
1: P, 2: L, 3: U, 4: S, 5: H -> pattern ? U S ? No: _ _ _ S _ : so word is P L U S H? That is ""PLUSH"". 

Now, does it have O? No. Because we know O is present? So must have O? And PLUSH has no O? So invalid.

Similarly, ""FLUSH"": same letters? F,L,U,S,H -> no O -> invalid.

We must have O somewhere? So the word needs to include O? And O must be in L1, L3, or L5.

Now, back to L3=O: word pattern _ _ O S _

What words have that pattern? And avoid forbidden letters.

Examples: 
- ""WHOPS"" has O, but position 4 is P? No? In ""WHOPS"": W(1), H(2), O(3), P(4), S(5) -> so position 4 is P? Not S? And we need L4=S.

What about ""GHOUL""? G,H,O,U,L -> but no S? And positions don't have S at 4? 

Another idea: ""BOUSY""? Not common.

Wait, perhaps ""DOGES""? D,O,G,E,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.

Or ""LOGES""? L,O,G,E,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.

At this point I think of ""FOCAL"" but no S and fourth letter? Not matching.

Another possibility: ""GOWNS""? G,O,W,N,S -> N forbidden -> invalid.

But let's use the available letters: we have B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and O (we know is present).

Also, we might consider Y? 

One word: ""JOLLY""? J,O,L,L,Y -> but then positions? 1:J, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y? So L4=L, not S. 

""SOUPY"": S,O,U,P,Y -> S is at position 1, not 4? And then O at 2? But O cannot be at position 2? Because in feedback for ""moist"", O is letter 2 and it was '-' (wrong position) but that means it is in the word but not at position 2? But in our new word, we have O at position 2? So that would be a mistake? Also, S at position 1? But we don't know about S at position 1? Could be? But also, if we guess S at position 1, and the secret word has S at position 4 and maybe not at 1? We don't know.

But more importantly, the pattern for our word must have S at position 4? So we need to fix that.

I found a word: ""FOULS"": F,O,U,L,S -> positions: 
1: F, 2: O, 3: U, 4: L? -> L is at 4? Then 5: S -> so position 4 is L? Not S? 

How about ""PIOUS"": P,I,O,U,S -> I forbidden -> invalid.

""LOUSY"": L,O,U,S,Y -> positions: 
1: L, 2: O, 3: U, 4: S, 5: Y -> yes! This matches: position 4 is S. 

Also, O is at position 2? But the feedback for ""moist"" had O at position 2 marked with '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position? But in ""LOUSY"", O is at position 2? Wouldn't that conflict?

The secret word has O, but not at position 2? So O cannot be at position 2? Therefore, we cannot guess a word with O at position 2? Because then we would expect it to be green? But the secret word does not have O at position 2? In ""LOUSY"", if we guess O at position 2, and the secret word has O elsewhere, it would be marked as '-' again? Wait? Not necessarily? Because in ""moist"", O was guessed at position 2 and marked '-', meaning the secret word has O not at 2? But it could be at 1,3, or 5? So if we guess O at position 2 again? It would still be marked '-' because it is still not correct? But that doesn't give new information? We already know it is not position 2? So it would be a wasted guess? 

However, the word ""LOUSY"" has O at position 2, which we know is incorrect? But we guess it anyway? Then the feedback will confirm: still yellow for O? So we wouldn't learn new positions? 

But also, ""LOUSY"" contains L at position 1, which we don't know if present or not? And U at 3, S at 4, Y at 5? 

But the problem: we are not supposed to reuse a letter in a position that is known wrong? Because it's inefficient? 

Could we instead use O in a different position? To gather information? 

So back to pattern: _ _ _ S O? Or _ _ O S _? 

For _ _ O S _? 

For example: ""FOCKS"" -> C forbidden.

""POCKS"": P,O,C,K,S -> C forbidden.

""LOCKS"": L,O,C,K,S -> C forbidden? 

Can't use C.

Without C? How about ""DOUBS"": D,O,U,B,S -> positions: 
1: D, 2: O, 3: U, 4: B? Then 5: S? Not S at position 4? 

Then for pattern _ _ _ S O: words ending with ""SO""? 

Examples: ""VERSO"" -> E and R forbidden -> invalid.

""BIASO"" not a word.

""BASSO"": B,A,S,S,O -> A forbidden? and S doubled? But maybe ""BASSO"" is a word? But A forbidden -> invalid.

""BOSSO"" not a word.

Perhaps ""SUSO"" not.

Another idea: ""GUESS"" -> G,U,E,S,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.

""BUOYS"": B,U,O,Y,S -> positions: 
1: B, 2: U, 3: O, 4: Y, 5: S -> so position 4 is Y? Not S.

How about ""FLUES"": E forbidden? 

I recall the earlier candidate ""FLOSS"": 
- F L O S S -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:S, 5:S.
- We have O in position 3? So not 2? Okay.
- Avoids all forbidden letters: F,L,O,S are allowed? S is already known present? 
- Also, O is used in position 3? So we will see if O is green in position 3? 

But we also have S at position 5? That might be a duplicate? 

The feedback for ""FLOSS"" would show:
- F: we don't know? Could be new.
- L: at position 2? Test.
- O: at position 3? Since we know O is present, but previously known not in position 2.
- S at position 4: should be green? Already known as correct.
- S at position 5: may be green or yellow or black? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

Since in the secret word, position 4 is S, and if there is another S at the end, then we would get two S's.

But this is okay? 

Another possibility: ""GLOSS"": G,L,O,S,S -> same as FLOSS but with G? 

The point is, these words contain O and S? And S at position 4? And O in position 3? 

We can choose ""FLOSS"" for the next guess? It might work.

But ""FLOSS"" is a valid word.

We could also try ""PIOUS"" but I is forbidden? No.

Or ""DOUSY"": D,O,U,S,Y -> positions: 
1: D, 2: O, 3: U, 4: S, 5: Y -> position 4 is S? Yes! And O in position 2? But we know O cannot be in position 2? So why would we guess O in position 2 again? That would likely get '-' again? 

To respect the known information, we should avoid putting O in position 2? So ""DOUSY"" has O in position 2? Which we know is wrong? So we should avoid that? 

Thus, ""FLOSS"" seems better because O is in position 3? Which is a new position? 

Therefore, I will guess ""FLOSS"".

But ""FLOSS"" has two S's? Will that be a problem? The feedback for the S in position 5? If the secret word does not have an S in position 5, but only has one S at position 4, then the S in position 5 in the guess would be marked 'x'? Because the S at position 4 already took the single S? 

So by guessing ""FLOSS"", we can test whether there is a second S? And also learn about O's position.

Also, the letters F and L and the double S.

So, I think it's a good guess.

If not ""FLOSS"", what about ""BLESS""? But E forbidden -> invalid.

""CLASP"": C forbidden -> invalid.

""GLOSS"": same. 

Or ""SLOWS"": S,L,O,W,S -> positions: 
1:S, 2:L, 3:O, 4:W, 5:S -> not S at position 4? 

Hence, I choose ""FLOSS"".

So, next guess: ""floss""

<guess>floss</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (""crane""):** All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (marked ""x""), so these letters are **not in the secret word**.
2. **Guess 2 (""moist""):** 
   - M and I are absent (""x"") → Added to forbidden letters.
   - O is present but in the wrong position (""-"") → **O is in the word**, but not in position 2 (and not in position 4, since S is correct there).
   - S is correct in position 4 (""✓"") → **The 4th letter of the secret word is S.**
   - T is absent (""x"") → Added to forbidden letters.

**Forbidden letters:** C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.  
**Known position:** Position 4 must be S.  
**Present letters:** O must appear in the word, but **not in position 2** (since it was misplaced there in ""moist"") or position 4.  

For the next guess, I chose **""FLOSS""** because:
- It has **S in position 4** (matching known information).
- It includes **O** (required) in position 3 (testing a new possible location: position 3).
- It avoids all forbidden letters and introduces new common letters (F, L) to gather more clues.
- It tests for a potential duplicate S (position 5) to clarify letter frequency.
- Pattern fits: Possible positions for O (1, 3, or 5) are covered here by placing it in position 3.

<guess>floss</guess>",floss,"We have two sets of feedback:
1. From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E are all absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.
2. From ""moist"": 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: present but in wrong position (-)
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: correct and in the right position (✓) -> so the 4th letter of the secret word is S.
   - T: absent (x)

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have the letter O, but not in the second position (since in ""moist"" O is in second position and it's marked wrong position).
- The fourth letter is S.
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T (from both guesses).

Known absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Present letters: O is present (and we know it's not in position 2).

We also know the 4th letter is S.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has S as the 4th letter.
- Contains the letter O (but not in position 2).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Available letters: all except the absent ones. Note: we have used S and O (O is present). Also, we have not tested many letters yet.

List of available vowels: O (we know it's present), and U (since A, E, I are absent). Y might be used sometimes.

Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S (already used in one position), V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to think of words that end with S (since 4th letter is S, so the word is ? ? ? S ?).

Actually, the 4th letter is S, so the word has pattern: _ _ _ S _

With O somewhere, but not in position 2.

Also, since O is present and not in position 2, it can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Now, let's think of words that fit:

- First, the word must not have any of the forbidden letters.

Examples: 
- Could the word be ""FOCUS""? But FOCUS has F,O,C,U,S. However, C is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""JUMPS""? But JUMPS has U,M,P,S. M is forbidden -> invalid.
- We need to avoid M (absent) and others.

Another idea: ""POLES""? But E is forbidden -> invalid.

Alternative: ""GULPS""? G,U,L,P,S -> but let's check positions: 
Pattern: _ _ _ S _
If we put GULPS: G U L P S -> but the S is at the 5th? Wait, no: positions are:
1: G, 2: U, 3: L, 4: P? -> no, in GULPS, the letters are G,U,L,P,S so:
Position 1: G, position 2: U, position 3: L, position 4: P, position 5: S. But we need position 4 to be S, so pattern must be _ _ _ S _ meaning the fourth letter is S, so in GULPS the fourth letter is P (not S). So that doesn't work.

We need words that have S in the fourth position: so the word is ???S?

Examples: 
- BOLTS? But B,O,L,T,S -> T is forbidden? From guess 2, T is absent -> so T is forbidden. Invalid.
- DUCKS? D,U,C,K,S -> C is forbidden -> invalid.
- FLUBS? F,L,U,B,S -> but FLUBS may not be a word? Also, fourth letter must be S? In FLUBS: positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), B(4), S(5) -> but we need position 4 to be S? So no.

Actually, words with S in fourth position: 
- The fifth letter can be any, so words ending with two letters? But the fifth letter cannot be one of the forbidden ones.

Common words: 
- FOCUS is not because C and S is fifth?
- The pattern is X X X S Y, where X are the first three letters, Y the last.

Examples: 
- ""FOCUS"" -> positions: F(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), S(5) -> no, we need S in position 4.
- Words with S in the fourth position: like ""TRUSS"" -> T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5). But T and R are forbidden -> invalid.

Perhaps ""BUSKS"": B,U,S,K,S -> but positions: 
- Letter in position 4 would be K? BUSKS: 
  B(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> so position 4 is K, not S. 

We need the letter S exactly at position 4.

Common words: 
- ""GLASS"": G,L,A,S,S -> A is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""CLASS"": C forbidden -> invalid.
- ""GRASS"": G,R,A,S,S -> R and A forbidden -> invalid.
- ""BLESS"": B,L,E,S,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.
- ""PRESS"": P,R,E,S,S -> R,E forbidden -> invalid.

Other possibilities: 
- ""CROSS"": C forbidden -> invalid.
- ""FLOSS"": F,L,O,S,S -> 
  Positions: 
  1: F
  2: L
  3: O
  4: S
  5: S

Now, check forbidden letters: 
- F is not forbidden? Only absent letters are C,R,A,N,E,M,I,T. So F is allowed.
- L: allowed
- O: present, but we know O must be in the word. Here O is in position 3.
- S in position 4 and 5? But we have S only for position 4? Actually, we have two S's? The feedback for ""moist"" showed S in position 4 as correct, so we know only position 4 is S. But the secret word might contain another S? Feedback doesn't tell about duplicates unless guessed.

But ""moist"" had only one S, and it was in the correct position. So if the secret word has two S's, the feedback when guessing with two S's would show both.

We don't know if the secret word has another S? So ""FLOSS"" has two S's? It's possible? But let's check missing letters: ""FLOSS"": F, L, O, S, S. 

Does it avoid forbidden letters? Yes: no C,R,A,N,E,M,I,T.

Also, O is present and in position 3 (so not in position 2, as required).

This seems promising? But we don't know if there is another S. However, the feedback for ""moist"" didn't show any S in incorrect position because S was guessed in the fourth position and was correct. If the secret word had an S in another position, then when we guessed ""moist"" with S only in fourth, the feedback wouldn't show another S? Only shows the first occurrence? Actually, Wordle feedback accounts for duplicate letters appropriately.

Recall: the rules for duplicates:
- If the secret word has duplicate letters, then a guess must also include duplicates to account for them? Otherwise, the feedback will show only the presence based on the correct matches and then the wrong position for the extra? But it's tricky.

In our case, for ""moist"":
- The letter S was in position 4 and marked correct. That means that at least one S is in position 4. If the secret word has only one S, then any other S in the guess would be absent? But in ""moist"" we guessed only one S, so if the secret word has more S's, we wouldn't know? However, the feedback doesn't show the count beyond what is guessed? Actually, it does: for duplicates, it handles by matching correctly first, then the extras.

But in ""moist"", we had one S and it was correct. So if the secret word has two S's, then when we guess with only one S in position 4, we should get a yellow or green for the S? Only green for the position 4, and the other S? But we didn't guess it? So no feedback for the extra S.

Thus, it's possible that the secret word has two S's? And we wouldn't know until we guess a word with an extra S? But we will be guessing ""FLOSS"" so we can test that.

But let's see: ""FLOSS"" has O in position 3? So we can try that? But wait, we have to avoid forbidden letters: and FLOSS seems okay? But we also need to consider that we have only 5 tries? Actually, we can try to use known information.

Another idea: ""FLOGS"": F,L,O,G,S -> G is allowed? Then: 
 Positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:G? -> wait, we need position 4 to be S? Not G.

So to have pattern ???S? and the word must include O? And O not in position 2.

Another common word: ""DOWNS""? D,O,W,N,S -> but N is forbidden? From ""crane"", N is absent? So N is forbidden -> invalid.

""SHOWS""? S,H,O,W,S -> but then position 4 would be W? Not S.

How about ""BOUSS""? Not a word. 

Let me think differently: 

Possible words with S in the fourth position: 
- The word is ??X?S? where the fourth letter is S? Actually, positions: let the word be L1, L2, L3, L4=S, L5.

And we know L4 = S.

With O present? Not in position 2? So O can be L1, L3, or L5.

Now, try L1= O: then pattern O _ _ S _
Examples: ""OUPHS"" (not common), ""OAKS"" (only 4 letters), actually 5-letter words: ""OASIS"" -> O,A,S,I,S -> A and I are forbidden? A and I absent. -> invalid.

Then L3=O: pattern: _ _ O S _
Examples: ""ABOBS"" -> A forbidden. 
""WHOPS"" -> W,H,O,P,S -> positions: 
1: W, 2: H, 3: O, 4: P? -> wait, position 4 must be S? So if the word is WHOSS? Not a word. 
Or ""GHOST"": G,H,O,S,T -> T is forbidden? But wait, in ""moist"", T was in position 5? And marked absent? So T is forbidden -> ""GHOST"" invalid.

But ""GHOST"" has O in position 3? And S in position 4? Exactly? But T is forbidden -> cannot use.

Similarly, ""JUMPS"" has M and position 4 is P? -> not.

Then L5=O: pattern: _ _ _ S O
So the word ends with SO? Or S then O? Actually: first three letters any, then S, then O? So word ends with ""SO"".

Examples: ""LASSO"": L,A,S,S,O -> A forbidden? and also positions: 
L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5) -> so position 4 is the second S, which is correct? But letter count: A and S? 
But A forbidden -> invalid.

Another one: ""VISSO"" not valid.

Perhaps ""BUXOM"" -> no S.

I need to search for words with S in position 4 and O in the word but not in position 2.

One word that comes to mind: ""GROSS"" -> but G,R,O,S,S -> R forbidden -> invalid.

""BLISS"": B,L,I,S,S -> I forbidden -> invalid.

""PLUSH"": P,L,U,S,H -> then position 4 is S? 
Letters: P,L,U,S,H -> positions: 
1: P, 2: L, 3: U, 4: S, 5: H -> pattern ? U S ? No: _ _ _ S _ : so word is P L U S H? That is ""PLUSH"". 

Now, does it have O? No. Because we know O is present? So must have O? And PLUSH has no O? So invalid.

Similarly, ""FLUSH"": same letters? F,L,U,S,H -> no O -> invalid.

We must have O somewhere? So the word needs to include O? And O must be in L1, L3, or L5.

Now, back to L3=O: word pattern _ _ O S _

What words have that pattern? And avoid forbidden letters.

Examples: 
- ""WHOPS"" has O, but position 4 is P? No? In ""WHOPS"": W(1), H(2), O(3), P(4), S(5) -> so position 4 is P? Not S? And we need L4=S.

What about ""GHOUL""? G,H,O,U,L -> but no S? And positions don't have S at 4? 

Another idea: ""BOUSY""? Not common.

Wait, perhaps ""DOGES""? D,O,G,E,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.

Or ""LOGES""? L,O,G,E,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.

At this point I think of ""FOCAL"" but no S and fourth letter? Not matching.

Another possibility: ""GOWNS""? G,O,W,N,S -> N forbidden -> invalid.

But let's use the available letters: we have B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and O (we know is present).

Also, we might consider Y? 

One word: ""JOLLY""? J,O,L,L,Y -> but then positions? 1:J, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y? So L4=L, not S. 

""SOUPY"": S,O,U,P,Y -> S is at position 1, not 4? And then O at 2? But O cannot be at position 2? Because in feedback for ""moist"", O is letter 2 and it was '-' (wrong position) but that means it is in the word but not at position 2? But in our new word, we have O at position 2? So that would be a mistake? Also, S at position 1? But we don't know about S at position 1? Could be? But also, if we guess S at position 1, and the secret word has S at position 4 and maybe not at 1? We don't know.

But more importantly, the pattern for our word must have S at position 4? So we need to fix that.

I found a word: ""FOULS"": F,O,U,L,S -> positions: 
1: F, 2: O, 3: U, 4: L? -> L is at 4? Then 5: S -> so position 4 is L? Not S? 

How about ""PIOUS"": P,I,O,U,S -> I forbidden -> invalid.

""LOUSY"": L,O,U,S,Y -> positions: 
1: L, 2: O, 3: U, 4: S, 5: Y -> yes! This matches: position 4 is S. 

Also, O is at position 2? But the feedback for ""moist"" had O at position 2 marked with '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position? But in ""LOUSY"", O is at position 2? Wouldn't that conflict?

The secret word has O, but not at position 2? So O cannot be at position 2? Therefore, we cannot guess a word with O at position 2? Because then we would expect it to be green? But the secret word does not have O at position 2? In ""LOUSY"", if we guess O at position 2, and the secret word has O elsewhere, it would be marked as '-' again? Wait? Not necessarily? Because in ""moist"", O was guessed at position 2 and marked '-', meaning the secret word has O not at 2? But it could be at 1,3, or 5? So if we guess O at position 2 again? It would still be marked '-' because it is still not correct? But that doesn't give new information? We already know it is not position 2? So it would be a wasted guess? 

However, the word ""LOUSY"" has O at position 2, which we know is incorrect? But we guess it anyway? Then the feedback will confirm: still yellow for O? So we wouldn't learn new positions? 

But also, ""LOUSY"" contains L at position 1, which we don't know if present or not? And U at 3, S at 4, Y at 5? 

But the problem: we are not supposed to reuse a letter in a position that is known wrong? Because it's inefficient? 

Could we instead use O in a different position? To gather information? 

So back to pattern: _ _ _ S O? Or _ _ O S _? 

For _ _ O S _? 

For example: ""FOCKS"" -> C forbidden.

""POCKS"": P,O,C,K,S -> C forbidden.

""LOCKS"": L,O,C,K,S -> C forbidden? 

Can't use C.

Without C? How about ""DOUBS"": D,O,U,B,S -> positions: 
1: D, 2: O, 3: U, 4: B? Then 5: S? Not S at position 4? 

Then for pattern _ _ _ S O: words ending with ""SO""? 

Examples: ""VERSO"" -> E and R forbidden -> invalid.

""BIASO"" not a word.

""BASSO"": B,A,S,S,O -> A forbidden? and S doubled? But maybe ""BASSO"" is a word? But A forbidden -> invalid.

""BOSSO"" not a word.

Perhaps ""SUSO"" not.

Another idea: ""GUESS"" -> G,U,E,S,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.

""BUOYS"": B,U,O,Y,S -> positions: 
1: B, 2: U, 3: O, 4: Y, 5: S -> so position 4 is Y? Not S.

How about ""FLUES"": E forbidden? 

I recall the earlier candidate ""FLOSS"": 
- F L O S S -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:S, 5:S.
- We have O in position 3? So not 2? Okay.
- Avoids all forbidden letters: F,L,O,S are allowed? S is already known present? 
- Also, O is used in position 3? So we will see if O is green in position 3? 

But we also have S at position 5? That might be a duplicate? 

The feedback for ""FLOSS"" would show:
- F: we don't know? Could be new.
- L: at position 2? Test.
- O: at position 3? Since we know O is present, but previously known not in position 2.
- S at position 4: should be green? Already known as correct.
- S at position 5: may be green or yellow or black? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

Since in the secret word, position 4 is S, and if there is another S at the end, then we would get two S's.

But this is okay? 

Another possibility: ""GLOSS"": G,L,O,S,S -> same as FLOSS but with G? 

The point is, these words contain O and S? And S at position 4? And O in position 3? 

We can choose ""FLOSS"" for the next guess? It might work.

But ""FLOSS"" is a valid word.

We could also try ""PIOUS"" but I is forbidden? No.

Or ""DOUSY"": D,O,U,S,Y -> positions: 
1: D, 2: O, 3: U, 4: S, 5: Y -> position 4 is S? Yes! And O in position 2? But we know O cannot be in position 2? So why would we guess O in position 2 again? That would likely get '-' again? 

To respect the known information, we should avoid putting O in position 2? So ""DOUSY"" has O in position 2? Which we know is wrong? So we should avoid that? 

Thus, ""FLOSS"" seems better because O is in position 3? Which is a new position? 

Therefore, I will guess ""FLOSS"".

But ""FLOSS"" has two S's? Will that be a problem? The feedback for the S in position 5? If the secret word does not have an S in position 5, but only has one S at position 4, then the S in position 5 in the guess would be marked 'x'? Because the S at position 4 already took the single S? 

So by guessing ""FLOSS"", we can test whether there is a second S? And also learn about O's position.

Also, the letters F and L and the double S.

So, I think it's a good guess.

If not ""FLOSS"", what about ""BLESS""? But E forbidden -> invalid.

""CLASP"": C forbidden -> invalid.

""GLOSS"": same. 

Or ""SLOWS"": S,L,O,W,S -> positions: 
1:S, 2:L, 3:O, 4:W, 5:S -> not S at position 4? 

Hence, I choose ""FLOSS"".

So, next guess: ""floss""

<guess>floss</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (""crane""):** All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (marked ""x""), so these letters are **not in the secret word**.
2. **Guess 2 (""moist""):** 
   - M and I are absent (""x"") → Added to forbidden letters.
   - O is present but in the wrong position (""-"") → **O is in the word**, but not in position 2 (and not in position 4, since S is correct there).
   - S is correct in position 4 (""✓"") → **The 4th letter of the secret word is S.**
   - T is absent (""x"") → Added to forbidden letters.

**Forbidden letters:** C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.  
**Known position:** Position 4 must be S.  
**Present letters:** O must appear in the word, but **not in position 2** (since it was misplaced there in ""moist"") or position 4.  

For the next guess, I chose **""FLOSS""** because:
- It has **S in position 4** (matching known information).
- It includes **O** (required) in position 3 (testing a new possible location: position 3).
- It avoids all forbidden letters and introduces new common letters (F, L) to gather more clues.
- It tests for a potential duplicate S (position 5) to clarify letter frequency.
- Pattern fits: Possible positions for O (1, 3, or 5) are covered here by placing it in position 3.",Guess 3: floss -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There is no prior feedback, so we need a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.
 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has three common consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), and it's a well-regarded starting word.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think about common letters that are left. We can consider other vowels and consonants.
 Vowels left: I, O, U (since A and E are out, and sometimes Y, but Y is less common)
 Consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance of hitting some in the word.

 Some good starting words without the forbidden letters might be: ""SLOTH"", ""PIOUS"", ""BUILT"", etc.

 However, note that we have to avoid E and A, which are very common. So let's try to pick a word with other common letters.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, H, D, M, etc.

 We can try a word like ""SLOTH"": 
   S, L, O, T, H. But O is a vowel and we have it.

 Alternatively, ""PILOT"" uses P, I, L, O, T. But we have to check if any of these are forbidden? We know C,R,A,N,E are out, so PILOT is okay.

 However, we might also consider ""TOILS"" or ""MOIST"". 

 Another idea: ""BUMPY"" but that has Y and is less common.

 Let's list some words without C,R,A,N,E:
 - ""SLIPT"" (not common, and only 5 letters? Actually, ""SLIPT"" is not standard, better avoid)
 - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> all allowed and common.

 ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has common letters and two vowels (O and I) that we haven't tried.

 Alternatively, ""POUCH"" is not allowed because it has C? But C is forbidden, so no.

 Another word: ""LUMPS"" - L, U, M, P, S.

 But let's go with ""MOIST"" because it's a well-known word.

 So, next guess: ""moist""

 We'll use ""moist"".

<guess>moist</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"", where all letters (C, R, A, N, E) were marked as incorrect (x), these letters are **not** in the secret word. For the next guess, I need to choose a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely. 

I'll prioritize common remaining consonants (like S, T, L, M) and vowels (O, I, U) to maximize new information. A strong candidate is **""moist""**, as it:
- Uses frequent letters (M, O, I, S, T) not yet tested.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- Provides broad coverage of the alphabet.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:
1. From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E are all absent (x). So the secret word has none of these letters.
2. From ""moist"": 
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: present but in wrong position (-)
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: correct and in the right position (✓) -> so the 4th letter of the secret word is S.
   - T: absent (x)

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have the letter O, but not in the second position (since in ""moist"" O is in second position and it's marked wrong position).
- The fourth letter is S.
- Does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T (from both guesses).

Known absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Present letters: O is present (and we know it's not in position 2).

We also know the 4th letter is S.

We need to form a 5-letter word that:
- Has S as the 4th letter.
- Contains the letter O (but not in position 2).
- Does not contain any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.

Available letters: all except the absent ones. Note: we have used S and O (O is present). Also, we have not tested many letters yet.

List of available vowels: O (we know it's present), and U (since A, E, I are absent). Y might be used sometimes.

Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, S (already used in one position), V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to think of words that end with S (since 4th letter is S, so the word is ? ? ? S ?).

Actually, the 4th letter is S, so the word has pattern: _ _ _ S _

With O somewhere, but not in position 2.

Also, since O is present and not in position 2, it can be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Now, let's think of words that fit:

- First, the word must not have any of the forbidden letters.

Examples: 
- Could the word be ""FOCUS""? But FOCUS has F,O,C,U,S. However, C is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""JUMPS""? But JUMPS has U,M,P,S. M is forbidden -> invalid.
- We need to avoid M (absent) and others.

Another idea: ""POLES""? But E is forbidden -> invalid.

Alternative: ""GULPS""? G,U,L,P,S -> but let's check positions: 
Pattern: _ _ _ S _
If we put GULPS: G U L P S -> but the S is at the 5th? Wait, no: positions are:
1: G, 2: U, 3: L, 4: P? -> no, in GULPS, the letters are G,U,L,P,S so:
Position 1: G, position 2: U, position 3: L, position 4: P, position 5: S. But we need position 4 to be S, so pattern must be _ _ _ S _ meaning the fourth letter is S, so in GULPS the fourth letter is P (not S). So that doesn't work.

We need words that have S in the fourth position: so the word is ???S?

Examples: 
- BOLTS? But B,O,L,T,S -> T is forbidden? From guess 2, T is absent -> so T is forbidden. Invalid.
- DUCKS? D,U,C,K,S -> C is forbidden -> invalid.
- FLUBS? F,L,U,B,S -> but FLUBS may not be a word? Also, fourth letter must be S? In FLUBS: positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), B(4), S(5) -> but we need position 4 to be S? So no.

Actually, words with S in fourth position: 
- The fifth letter can be any, so words ending with two letters? But the fifth letter cannot be one of the forbidden ones.

Common words: 
- FOCUS is not because C and S is fifth?
- The pattern is X X X S Y, where X are the first three letters, Y the last.

Examples: 
- ""FOCUS"" -> positions: F(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), S(5) -> no, we need S in position 4.
- Words with S in the fourth position: like ""TRUSS"" -> T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5). But T and R are forbidden -> invalid.

Perhaps ""BUSKS"": B,U,S,K,S -> but positions: 
- Letter in position 4 would be K? BUSKS: 
  B(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> so position 4 is K, not S. 

We need the letter S exactly at position 4.

Common words: 
- ""GLASS"": G,L,A,S,S -> A is forbidden -> invalid.
- ""CLASS"": C forbidden -> invalid.
- ""GRASS"": G,R,A,S,S -> R and A forbidden -> invalid.
- ""BLESS"": B,L,E,S,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.
- ""PRESS"": P,R,E,S,S -> R,E forbidden -> invalid.

Other possibilities: 
- ""CROSS"": C forbidden -> invalid.
- ""FLOSS"": F,L,O,S,S -> 
  Positions: 
  1: F
  2: L
  3: O
  4: S
  5: S

Now, check forbidden letters: 
- F is not forbidden? Only absent letters are C,R,A,N,E,M,I,T. So F is allowed.
- L: allowed
- O: present, but we know O must be in the word. Here O is in position 3.
- S in position 4 and 5? But we have S only for position 4? Actually, we have two S's? The feedback for ""moist"" showed S in position 4 as correct, so we know only position 4 is S. But the secret word might contain another S? Feedback doesn't tell about duplicates unless guessed.

But ""moist"" had only one S, and it was in the correct position. So if the secret word has two S's, the feedback when guessing with two S's would show both.

We don't know if the secret word has another S? So ""FLOSS"" has two S's? It's possible? But let's check missing letters: ""FLOSS"": F, L, O, S, S. 

Does it avoid forbidden letters? Yes: no C,R,A,N,E,M,I,T.

Also, O is present and in position 3 (so not in position 2, as required).

This seems promising? But we don't know if there is another S. However, the feedback for ""moist"" didn't show any S in incorrect position because S was guessed in the fourth position and was correct. If the secret word had an S in another position, then when we guessed ""moist"" with S only in fourth, the feedback wouldn't show another S? Only shows the first occurrence? Actually, Wordle feedback accounts for duplicate letters appropriately.

Recall: the rules for duplicates:
- If the secret word has duplicate letters, then a guess must also include duplicates to account for them? Otherwise, the feedback will show only the presence based on the correct matches and then the wrong position for the extra? But it's tricky.

In our case, for ""moist"":
- The letter S was in position 4 and marked correct. That means that at least one S is in position 4. If the secret word has only one S, then any other S in the guess would be absent? But in ""moist"" we guessed only one S, so if the secret word has more S's, we wouldn't know? However, the feedback doesn't show the count beyond what is guessed? Actually, it does: for duplicates, it handles by matching correctly first, then the extras.

But in ""moist"", we had one S and it was correct. So if the secret word has two S's, then when we guess with only one S in position 4, we should get a yellow or green for the S? Only green for the position 4, and the other S? But we didn't guess it? So no feedback for the extra S.

Thus, it's possible that the secret word has two S's? And we wouldn't know until we guess a word with an extra S? But we will be guessing ""FLOSS"" so we can test that.

But let's see: ""FLOSS"" has O in position 3? So we can try that? But wait, we have to avoid forbidden letters: and FLOSS seems okay? But we also need to consider that we have only 5 tries? Actually, we can try to use known information.

Another idea: ""FLOGS"": F,L,O,G,S -> G is allowed? Then: 
 Positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:G? -> wait, we need position 4 to be S? Not G.

So to have pattern ???S? and the word must include O? And O not in position 2.

Another common word: ""DOWNS""? D,O,W,N,S -> but N is forbidden? From ""crane"", N is absent? So N is forbidden -> invalid.

""SHOWS""? S,H,O,W,S -> but then position 4 would be W? Not S.

How about ""BOUSS""? Not a word. 

Let me think differently: 

Possible words with S in the fourth position: 
- The word is ??X?S? where the fourth letter is S? Actually, positions: let the word be L1, L2, L3, L4=S, L5.

And we know L4 = S.

With O present? Not in position 2? So O can be L1, L3, or L5.

Now, try L1= O: then pattern O _ _ S _
Examples: ""OUPHS"" (not common), ""OAKS"" (only 4 letters), actually 5-letter words: ""OASIS"" -> O,A,S,I,S -> A and I are forbidden? A and I absent. -> invalid.

Then L3=O: pattern: _ _ O S _
Examples: ""ABOBS"" -> A forbidden. 
""WHOPS"" -> W,H,O,P,S -> positions: 
1: W, 2: H, 3: O, 4: P? -> wait, position 4 must be S? So if the word is WHOSS? Not a word. 
Or ""GHOST"": G,H,O,S,T -> T is forbidden? But wait, in ""moist"", T was in position 5? And marked absent? So T is forbidden -> ""GHOST"" invalid.

But ""GHOST"" has O in position 3? And S in position 4? Exactly? But T is forbidden -> cannot use.

Similarly, ""JUMPS"" has M and position 4 is P? -> not.

Then L5=O: pattern: _ _ _ S O
So the word ends with SO? Or S then O? Actually: first three letters any, then S, then O? So word ends with ""SO"".

Examples: ""LASSO"": L,A,S,S,O -> A forbidden? and also positions: 
L(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5) -> so position 4 is the second S, which is correct? But letter count: A and S? 
But A forbidden -> invalid.

Another one: ""VISSO"" not valid.

Perhaps ""BUXOM"" -> no S.

I need to search for words with S in position 4 and O in the word but not in position 2.

One word that comes to mind: ""GROSS"" -> but G,R,O,S,S -> R forbidden -> invalid.

""BLISS"": B,L,I,S,S -> I forbidden -> invalid.

""PLUSH"": P,L,U,S,H -> then position 4 is S? 
Letters: P,L,U,S,H -> positions: 
1: P, 2: L, 3: U, 4: S, 5: H -> pattern ? U S ? No: _ _ _ S _ : so word is P L U S H? That is ""PLUSH"". 

Now, does it have O? No. Because we know O is present? So must have O? And PLUSH has no O? So invalid.

Similarly, ""FLUSH"": same letters? F,L,U,S,H -> no O -> invalid.

We must have O somewhere? So the word needs to include O? And O must be in L1, L3, or L5.

Now, back to L3=O: word pattern _ _ O S _

What words have that pattern? And avoid forbidden letters.

Examples: 
- ""WHOPS"" has O, but position 4 is P? No? In ""WHOPS"": W(1), H(2), O(3), P(4), S(5) -> so position 4 is P? Not S? And we need L4=S.

What about ""GHOUL""? G,H,O,U,L -> but no S? And positions don't have S at 4? 

Another idea: ""BOUSY""? Not common.

Wait, perhaps ""DOGES""? D,O,G,E,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.

Or ""LOGES""? L,O,G,E,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.

At this point I think of ""FOCAL"" but no S and fourth letter? Not matching.

Another possibility: ""GOWNS""? G,O,W,N,S -> N forbidden -> invalid.

But let's use the available letters: we have B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and O (we know is present).

Also, we might consider Y? 

One word: ""JOLLY""? J,O,L,L,Y -> but then positions? 1:J, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y? So L4=L, not S. 

""SOUPY"": S,O,U,P,Y -> S is at position 1, not 4? And then O at 2? But O cannot be at position 2? Because in feedback for ""moist"", O is letter 2 and it was '-' (wrong position) but that means it is in the word but not at position 2? But in our new word, we have O at position 2? So that would be a mistake? Also, S at position 1? But we don't know about S at position 1? Could be? But also, if we guess S at position 1, and the secret word has S at position 4 and maybe not at 1? We don't know.

But more importantly, the pattern for our word must have S at position 4? So we need to fix that.

I found a word: ""FOULS"": F,O,U,L,S -> positions: 
1: F, 2: O, 3: U, 4: L? -> L is at 4? Then 5: S -> so position 4 is L? Not S? 

How about ""PIOUS"": P,I,O,U,S -> I forbidden -> invalid.

""LOUSY"": L,O,U,S,Y -> positions: 
1: L, 2: O, 3: U, 4: S, 5: Y -> yes! This matches: position 4 is S. 

Also, O is at position 2? But the feedback for ""moist"" had O at position 2 marked with '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position? But in ""LOUSY"", O is at position 2? Wouldn't that conflict?

The secret word has O, but not at position 2? So O cannot be at position 2? Therefore, we cannot guess a word with O at position 2? Because then we would expect it to be green? But the secret word does not have O at position 2? In ""LOUSY"", if we guess O at position 2, and the secret word has O elsewhere, it would be marked as '-' again? Wait? Not necessarily? Because in ""moist"", O was guessed at position 2 and marked '-', meaning the secret word has O not at 2? But it could be at 1,3, or 5? So if we guess O at position 2 again? It would still be marked '-' because it is still not correct? But that doesn't give new information? We already know it is not position 2? So it would be a wasted guess? 

However, the word ""LOUSY"" has O at position 2, which we know is incorrect? But we guess it anyway? Then the feedback will confirm: still yellow for O? So we wouldn't learn new positions? 

But also, ""LOUSY"" contains L at position 1, which we don't know if present or not? And U at 3, S at 4, Y at 5? 

But the problem: we are not supposed to reuse a letter in a position that is known wrong? Because it's inefficient? 

Could we instead use O in a different position? To gather information? 

So back to pattern: _ _ _ S O? Or _ _ O S _? 

For _ _ O S _? 

For example: ""FOCKS"" -> C forbidden.

""POCKS"": P,O,C,K,S -> C forbidden.

""LOCKS"": L,O,C,K,S -> C forbidden? 

Can't use C.

Without C? How about ""DOUBS"": D,O,U,B,S -> positions: 
1: D, 2: O, 3: U, 4: B? Then 5: S? Not S at position 4? 

Then for pattern _ _ _ S O: words ending with ""SO""? 

Examples: ""VERSO"" -> E and R forbidden -> invalid.

""BIASO"" not a word.

""BASSO"": B,A,S,S,O -> A forbidden? and S doubled? But maybe ""BASSO"" is a word? But A forbidden -> invalid.

""BOSSO"" not a word.

Perhaps ""SUSO"" not.

Another idea: ""GUESS"" -> G,U,E,S,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.

""BUOYS"": B,U,O,Y,S -> positions: 
1: B, 2: U, 3: O, 4: Y, 5: S -> so position 4 is Y? Not S.

How about ""FLUES"": E forbidden? 

I recall the earlier candidate ""FLOSS"": 
- F L O S S -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:S, 5:S.
- We have O in position 3? So not 2? Okay.
- Avoids all forbidden letters: F,L,O,S are allowed? S is already known present? 
- Also, O is used in position 3? So we will see if O is green in position 3? 

But we also have S at position 5? That might be a duplicate? 

The feedback for ""FLOSS"" would show:
- F: we don't know? Could be new.
- L: at position 2? Test.
- O: at position 3? Since we know O is present, but previously known not in position 2.
- S at position 4: should be green? Already known as correct.
- S at position 5: may be green or yellow or black? But we don't know if the word has two S's.

Since in the secret word, position 4 is S, and if there is another S at the end, then we would get two S's.

But this is okay? 

Another possibility: ""GLOSS"": G,L,O,S,S -> same as FLOSS but with G? 

The point is, these words contain O and S? And S at position 4? And O in position 3? 

We can choose ""FLOSS"" for the next guess? It might work.

But ""FLOSS"" is a valid word.

We could also try ""PIOUS"" but I is forbidden? No.

Or ""DOUSY"": D,O,U,S,Y -> positions: 
1: D, 2: O, 3: U, 4: S, 5: Y -> position 4 is S? Yes! And O in position 2? But we know O cannot be in position 2? So why would we guess O in position 2 again? That would likely get '-' again? 

To respect the known information, we should avoid putting O in position 2? So ""DOUSY"" has O in position 2? Which we know is wrong? So we should avoid that? 

Thus, ""FLOSS"" seems better because O is in position 3? Which is a new position? 

Therefore, I will guess ""FLOSS"".

But ""FLOSS"" has two S's? Will that be a problem? The feedback for the S in position 5? If the secret word does not have an S in position 5, but only has one S at position 4, then the S in position 5 in the guess would be marked 'x'? Because the S at position 4 already took the single S? 

So by guessing ""FLOSS"", we can test whether there is a second S? And also learn about O's position.

Also, the letters F and L and the double S.

So, I think it's a good guess.

If not ""FLOSS"", what about ""BLESS""? But E forbidden -> invalid.

""CLASP"": C forbidden -> invalid.

""GLOSS"": same. 

Or ""SLOWS"": S,L,O,W,S -> positions: 
1:S, 2:L, 3:O, 4:W, 5:S -> not S at position 4? 

Hence, I choose ""FLOSS"".

So, next guess: ""floss""

<guess>floss</guess>After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (""crane""):** All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (marked ""x""), so these letters are **not in the secret word**.
2. **Guess 2 (""moist""):** 
   - M and I are absent (""x"") → Added to forbidden letters.
   - O is present but in the wrong position (""-"") → **O is in the word**, but not in position 2 (and not in position 4, since S is correct there).
   - S is correct in position 4 (""✓"") → **The 4th letter of the secret word is S.**
   - T is absent (""x"") → Added to forbidden letters.

**Forbidden letters:** C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T.  
**Known position:** Position 4 must be S.  
**Present letters:** O must appear in the word, but **not in position 2** (since it was misplaced there in ""moist"") or position 4.  

For the next guess, I chose **""FLOSS""** because:
- It has **S in position 4** (matching known information).
- It includes **O** (required) in position 3 (testing a new possible location: position 3).
- It avoids all forbidden letters and introduces new common letters (F, L) to gather more clues.
- It tests for a potential duplicate S (position 5) to clarify letter frequency.
- Pattern fits: Possible positions for O (1, 3, or 5) are covered here by placing it in position 3.

S ?).\n\nActually, the 4th letter is S, so the word has pattern: _ _ _ S _\n\nWith O somewhere, but not in position 2.\n\nAlso, since O is present and not in position 2, it can be in position 1, 3, or 5.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that fit:\n\n- First, the word must not have any of the forbidden letters.\n\nExamples: \n- Could the word be ""FOCUS""? But FOCUS has F,O,C,U,S. However, C is forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""JUMPS""? But JUMPS has U,M,P,S. M is forbidden -> invalid.\n- We need to avoid M (absent) and others.\n\nAnother idea: ""POLES""? But E is forbidden -> invalid.\n\nAlternative: ""GULPS""? G,U,L,P,S -> but let\'s check positions: \nPattern: _ _ _ S _\nIf we put GULPS: G U L P S -> but the S is at the 5th? Wait, no: positions are:\n1: G, 2: U, 3: L, 4: P? -> no, in GULPS, the letters are G,U,L,P,S so:\nPosition 1: G, position 2: U, position 3: L, position 4: P, position 5: S. But we need position 4 to be S, so pattern must be _ _ _ S _ meaning the fourth letter is S, so in GULPS the fourth letter is P (not S). So that doesn\'t work.\n\nWe need words that have S in the fourth position: so the word is ???S?\n\nExamples: \n- BOLTS? But B,O,L,T,S -> T is forbidden? From guess 2, T is absent -> so T is forbidden. Invalid.\n- DUCKS? D,U,C,K,S -> C is forbidden -> invalid.\n- FLUBS? F,L,U,B,S -> but FLUBS may not be a word? Also, fourth letter must be S? In FLUBS: positions: F(1), L(2), U(3), B(4), S(5) -> but we need position 4 to be S? So no.\n\nActually, words with S in fourth position: \n- The fifth letter can be any, so words ending with two letters? But the fifth letter cannot be one of the forbidden ones.\n\nCommon words: \n- FOCUS is not because C and S is fifth?\n- The pattern is X X X S Y, where X are the first three letters, Y the last.\n\nExamples: \n- ""FOCUS"" -> positions: F(1), O(2), C(3), U(4), S(5) -> no, we need S in position 4.\n- Words with S in the fourth position: like ""TRUSS"" -> T(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), S(5). But T and R are forbidden -> invalid.\n\nPerhaps ""BUSKS"": B,U,S,K,S -> but positions: \n- Letter in position 4 would be K? BUSKS: \n  B(1), U(2), S(3), K(4), S(5) -> so position 4 is K, not S. \n\nWe need the letter S exactly at position 4.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""GLASS"": G,L,A,S,S -> A is forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""CLASS"": C forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""GRASS"": G,R,A,S,S -> R and A forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""BLESS"": B,L,E,S,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""PRESS"": P,R,E,S,S -> R,E forbidden -> invalid.\n\nOther possibilities: \n- ""CROSS"": C forbidden -> invalid.\n- ""FLOSS"": F,L,O,S,S -> \n  Positions: \n  1: F\n  2: L\n  3: O\n  4: S\n  5: S\n\nNow, check forbidden letters: \n- F is not forbidden? Only absent letters are C,R,A,N,E,M,I,T. So F is allowed.\n- L: allowed\n- O: present, but we know O must be in the word. Here O is in position 3.\n- S in position 4 and 5? But we have S only for position 4? Actually, we have two S\'s? The feedback for ""moist"" showed S in position 4 as correct, so we know only position 4 is S. But the secret word might contain another S? Feedback doesn\'t tell about duplicates unless guessed.\n\nBut ""moist"" had only one S, and it was in the correct position. So if the secret word has two S\'s, the feedback when guessing with two S\'s would show both.\n\nWe don\'t know if the secret word has another S? So ""FLOSS"" has two S\'s? It\'s possible? But let\'s check missing letters: ""FLOSS"": F, L, O, S, S. \n\nDoes it avoid forbidden letters? Yes: no C,R,A,N,E,M,I,T.\n\nAlso, O is present and in position 3 (so not in position 2, as required).\n\nThis seems promising? But we don\'t know if there is another S. However, the feedback for ""moist"" didn\'t show any S in incorrect position because S was guessed in the fourth position and was correct. If the secret word had an S in another position, then when we guessed ""moist"" with S only in fourth, the feedback wouldn\'t show another S? Only shows the first occurrence? Actually, Wordle feedback accounts for duplicate letters appropriately.\n\nRecall: the rules for duplicates:\n- If the secret word has duplicate letters, then a guess must also include duplicates to account for them? Otherwise, the feedback will show only the presence based on the correct matches and then the wrong position for the extra? But it\'s tricky.\n\nIn our case, for ""moist"":\n- The letter S was in position 4 and marked correct. That means that at least one S is in position 4. If the secret word has only one S, then any other S in the guess would be absent? But in ""moist"" we guessed only one S, so if the secret word has more S\'s, we wouldn\'t know? However, the feedback doesn\'t show the count beyond what is guessed? Actually, it does: for duplicates, it handles by matching correctly first, then the extras.\n\nBut in ""moist"", we had one S and it was correct. So if the secret word has two S\'s, then when we guess with only one S in position 4, we should get a yellow or green for the S? Only green for the position 4, and the other S? But we didn\'t guess it? So no feedback for the extra S.\n\nThus, it\'s possible that the secret word has two S\'s? And we wouldn\'t know until we guess a word with an extra S? But we will be guessing ""FLOSS"" so we can test that.\n\nBut let\'s see: ""FLOSS"" has O in position 3? So we can try that? But wait, we have to avoid forbidden letters: and FLOSS seems okay? But we also need to consider that we have only 5 tries? Actually, we can try to use known information.\n\nAnother idea: ""FLOGS"": F,L,O,G,S -> G is allowed? Then: \n Positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:G? -> wait, we need position 4 to be S? Not G.\n\nSo to have pattern ???S? and the word must include O? And O not in position 2.\n\nAnother common word: ""DOWNS""? D,O,W,N,S -> but N is forbidden? From ""crane"", N is absent? So N is forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""SHOWS""? S,H,O,W,S -> but then position 4 would be W? Not S.\n\nHow about ""BOUSS""? Not a word. \n\nLet me think differently: \n\nPossible words with S in the fourth position: \n- The word is ??X?S? where the fourth letter is S? Actually, positions: let the word be L1, L2, L3, L4=S, L5.\n\nAnd we know L4 = S.\n\nWith O present? Not in position 2? So O can be L1, L3, or L5.\n\nNow, try L1= O: then pattern O _ _ S _\nExamples: ""OUPHS"" (not common), ""OAKS"" (only 4 letters), actually 5-letter words: ""OASIS"" -> O,A,S,I,S -> A and I are forbidden? A and I absent. -> invalid.\n\nThen L3=O: pattern: _ _ O S _\nExamples: ""ABOBS"" -> A forbidden. \n""WHOPS"" -> W,H,O,P,S -> positions: \n1: W, 2: H, 3: O, 4: P? -> wait, position 4 must be S? So if the word is WHOSS? Not a word. \nOr ""GHOST"": G,H,O,S,T -> T is forbidden? But wait, in ""moist"", T was in position 5? And marked absent? So T is forbidden -> ""GHOST"" invalid.\n\nBut ""GHOST"" has O in position 3? And S in position 4? Exactly? But T is forbidden -> cannot use.\n\nSimilarly, ""JUMPS"" has M and position 4 is P? -> not.\n\nThen L5=O: pattern: _ _ _ S O\nSo the word ends with SO? Or S then O? Actually: first three letters any, then S, then O? So word ends with ""SO"".\n\nExamples: ""LASSO"": L,A,S,S,O -> A forbidden? and also positions: \nL(1), A(2), S(3), S(4), O(5) -> so position 4 is the second S, which is correct? But letter count: A and S? \nBut A forbidden -> invalid.\n\nAnother one: ""VISSO"" not valid.\n\nPerhaps ""BUXOM"" -> no S.\n\nI need to search for words with S in position 4 and O in the word but not in position 2.\n\nOne word that comes to mind: ""GROSS"" -> but G,R,O,S,S -> R forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""BLISS"": B,L,I,S,S -> I forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""PLUSH"": P,L,U,S,H -> then position 4 is S? \nLetters: P,L,U,S,H -> positions: \n1: P, 2: L, 3: U, 4: S, 5: H -> pattern ? U S ? No: _ _ _ S _ : so word is P L U S H? That is ""PLUSH"". \n\nNow, does it have O? No. Because we know O is present? So must have O? And PLUSH has no O? So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""FLUSH"": same letters? F,L,U,S,H -> no O -> invalid.\n\nWe must have O somewhere? So the word needs to include O? And O must be in L1, L3, or L5.\n\nNow, back to L3=O: word pattern _ _ O S _\n\nWhat words have that pattern? And avoid forbidden letters.\n\nExamples: \n- ""WHOPS"" has O, but position 4 is P? No? In ""WHOPS"": W(1), H(2), O(3), P(4), S(5) -> so position 4 is P? Not S? And we need L4=S.\n\nWhat about ""GHOUL""? G,H,O,U,L -> but no S? And positions don\'t have S at 4? \n\nAnother idea: ""BOUSY""? Not common.\n\nWait, perhaps ""DOGES""? D,O,G,E,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.\n\nOr ""LOGES""? L,O,G,E,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.\n\nAt this point I think of ""FOCAL"" but no S and fourth letter? Not matching.\n\nAnother possibility: ""GOWNS""? G,O,W,N,S -> N forbidden -> invalid.\n\nBut let\'s use the available letters: we have B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and O (we know is present).\n\nAlso, we might consider Y? \n\nOne word: ""JOLLY""? J,O,L,L,Y -> but then positions? 1:J, 2:O, 3:L, 4:L, 5:Y? So L4=L, not S. \n\n""SOUPY"": S,O,U,P,Y -> S is at position 1, not 4? And then O at 2? But O cannot be at position 2? Because in feedback for ""moist"", O is letter 2 and it was \'-\' (wrong position) but that means it is in the word but not at position 2? But in our new word, we have O at position 2? So that would be a mistake? Also, S at position 1? But we don\'t know about S at position 1? Could be? But also, if we guess S at position 1, and the secret word has S at position 4 and maybe not at 1? We don\'t know.\n\nBut more importantly, the pattern for our word must have S at position 4? So we need to fix that.\n\nI found a word: ""FOULS"": F,O,U,L,S -> positions: \n1: F, 2: O, 3: U, 4: L? -> L is at 4? Then 5: S -> so position 4 is L? Not S? \n\nHow about ""PIOUS"": P,I,O,U,S -> I forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""LOUSY"": L,O,U,S,Y -> positions: \n1: L, 2: O, 3: U, 4: S, 5: Y -> yes! This matches: position 4 is S. \n\nAlso, O is at position 2? But the feedback for ""moist"" had O at position 2 marked with \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at that position? But in ""LOUSY"", O is at position 2? Wouldn\'t that conflict?\n\nThe secret word has O, but not at position 2? So O cannot be at position 2? Therefore, we cannot guess a word with O at position 2? Because then we would expect it to be green? But the secret word does not have O at position 2? In ""LOUSY"", if we guess O at position 2, and the secret word has O elsewhere, it would be marked as \'-\' again? Wait? Not necessarily? Because in ""moist"", O was guessed at position 2 and marked \'-\', meaning the secret word has O not at 2? But it could be at 1,3, or 5? So if we guess O at position 2 again? It would still be marked \'-\' because it is still not correct? But that doesn\'t give new information? We already know it is not position 2? So it would be a wasted guess? \n\nHowever, the word ""LOUSY"" has O at position 2, which we know is incorrect? But we guess it anyway? Then the feedback will confirm: still yellow for O? So we wouldn\'t learn new positions? \n\nBut also, ""LOUSY"" contains L at position 1, which we don\'t know if present or not? And U at 3, S at 4, Y at 5? \n\nBut the problem: we are not supposed to reuse a letter in a position that is known wrong? Because it\'s inefficient? \n\nCould we instead use O in a different position? To gather information? \n\nSo back to pattern: _ _ _ S O? Or _ _ O S _? \n\nFor _ _ O S _? \n\nFor example: ""FOCKS"" -> C forbidden.\n\n""POCKS"": P,O,C,K,S -> C forbidden.\n\n""LOCKS"": L,O,C,K,S -> C forbidden? \n\nCan\'t use C.\n\nWithout C? How about ""DOUBS"": D,O,U,B,S -> positions: \n1: D, 2: O, 3: U, 4: B? Then 5: S? Not S at position 4? \n\nThen for pattern _ _ _ S O: words ending with ""SO""? \n\nExamples: ""VERSO"" -> E and R forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""BIASO"" not a word.\n\n""BASSO"": B,A,S,S,O -> A forbidden? and S doubled? But maybe ""BASSO"" is a word? But A forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""BOSSO"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""SUSO"" not.\n\nAnother idea: ""GUESS"" -> G,U,E,S,S -> E forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""BUOYS"": B,U,O,Y,S -> positions: \n1: B, 2: U, 3: O, 4: Y, 5: S -> so position 4 is Y? Not S.\n\nHow about ""FLUES"": E forbidden? \n\nI recall the earlier candidate ""FLOSS"": \n- F L O S S -> positions: 1:F, 2:L, 3:O, 4:S, 5:S.\n- We have O in position 3? So not 2? Okay.\n- Avoids all forbidden letters: F,L,O,S are allowed? S is already known present? \n- Also, O is used in position 3? So we will see if O is green in position 3? \n\nBut we also have S at position 5? That might be a duplicate? \n\nThe feedback for ""FLOSS"" would show:\n- F: we don\'t know? Could be new.\n- L: at position 2? Test.\n- O: at position 3? Since we know O is present, but previously known not in position 2.\n- S at position 4: should be green? Already known as correct.\n- S at position 5: may be green or yellow or black? But we don\'t know if the word has two S\'s.\n\nSince in the secret word, position 4 is S, and if there is another S at the end, then we would get two S\'s.\n\nBut this is okay? \n\nAnother possibility: ""GLOSS"": G,L,O,S,S -> same as FLOSS but with G? \n\nThe point is, these words contain O and S? And S at position 4? And O in position 3? \n\nWe can choose ""FLOSS"" for the next guess? It might work.\n\nBut ""FLOSS"" is a valid word.\n\nWe could also try ""PIOUS"" but I is forbidden? No.\n\nOr ""DOUSY"": D,O,U,S,Y -> positions: \n1: D, 2: O, 3: U, 4: S, 5: Y -> position 4 is S? Yes! And O in position 2? But we know O cannot be in position 2? So why would we guess O in position 2 again? That would likely get \'-\' again? \n\nTo respect the known information, we should avoid putting O in position 2? So ""DOUSY"" has O in position 2? Which we know is wrong? So we should avoid that? \n\nThus, ""FLOSS"" seems better because O is in position 3? Which is a new position? \n\nTherefore, I will guess ""FLOSS"".\n\nBut ""FLOSS"" has two S\'s? Will that be a problem? The feedback for the S in position 5? If the secret word does not have an S in position 5, but only has one S at position 4, then the S in position 5 in the guess would be marked \'x\'?

We have feedback from Guess 3: ""floss"" -> F(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(✓)

Breaking down:
- F: absent (x) -> so F is not in the word.
- L: correct and in position (✓) at position 1? Wait, let's see the positions.

The word ""floss"" is: 
  Position 1: F
  Position 2: L
  Position 3: O
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: S

Feedback: 
  F(x) -> so F is absent? But it's in position 1? So the first letter is not F and F is not in the word.
  L(✓) -> L is correct and in the right position? But L is in position 2? So position 2 is L? 
  O(✓) -> O is correct and in position 3? So position 3 is O?
  S(✓) for the first S? That's position 4? We already knew position 4 is S? 
  S(✓) for the last S? So position 5 is also S? 

But the feedback says: S(✓) S(✓) for the two S's? That means both are correct? So the secret word has S in position 4 and position 5? 

But we already knew position 4 is S? Now we know position 5 is also S? 

Also, from the feedback:
- Position 2: L is correct? So the second letter is L.
- Position 3: O is correct? So the third letter is O.

And F is absent? So the first letter is not F and F is not in the word.

So now we know:
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: S

And the first letter is unknown? But we know it's not F, and not any of the forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: from previous guesses: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T, and now F.

Also, we know the word has O? But we already have it in position 3.

The secret word pattern: _ L O S S

We need to find the first letter? It must be a letter that is not forbidden? And it must form a valid English word.

Available letters: we have to avoid: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T, F.

Also, we have used: L, O, S (but S is repeated, but we know the first letter is not S? Because if it were S, then in ""floss"" we would have S at position 1? But position 1 was F and marked absent? So S at position 1 would be a different position? But we didn't guess S at position 1? So we don't know? 

But in the feedback for ""floss"", the first S is at position 4? And the second S at position 5? And both are correct? So if the secret word had S at position 1, then we would have three S's? But we didn't guess S at position 1? So we don't know? 

But the feedback for F at position 1 was absent? So the first letter is not F? And not S? Because if it were S, then we would have guessed S at position 1? But we didn't? So we have no information about position 1? Except that it's not F? 

But the secret word has two S's? At positions 4 and 5? So if the first letter were S, then it would be a third S? But we don't know? 

However, we can list possible words that end with ""LOSS""? 

Common words: 
- ""BLOSS"": not a word? 
- ""CLOSS"": not a word?
- ""FLOSS"": we guessed, but F is absent? So not.
- ""GLOSS"": G L O S S -> that's a word? Yes, meaning shine or luster? 
- ""SLOSS"": not a word.

Also, ""CROSS"": but C is forbidden? And R is forbidden? 

""PROSS"": not common.

""BLOBS"": B L O B S -> but then position 4 is B? Not S? And position 5 is S? But we need position 4 and 5 to be S? So no.

The word must end with ""OSS""? Actually, positions 3,4,5: O, S, S? So the last three letters are OSS? But position 3 is O, 4 is S, 5 is S? So the word ends with ""OSS""? 

And position 2 is L? So the word ends with ""LOSS""? 

So the word is ? L O S S

Possible first letters? Must be a consonant? And form a valid word.

Options:
- ""BLOSS"" is not a word? 
- ""CLOSS"" not.
- ""FLOSS"" we tried and F is absent? So not.
- ""GLOSS"" is a word. G L O S S.
- ""SLOSS"" not a word? 
- ""PLOSS"" not.

What about ""ALOSS""? But A is forbidden? 

""ILOSS""? I forbidden.

""MLOSS""? M forbidden.

""TLOSS""? T forbidden.

So the only common word I can think of is ""GLOSS"".

But is there ""VLOSS""? Not common.

Or ""KLOSS""? Not common.

""BLOSS"" might be a name? But we need a valid English word? 

Another word: ""DROSS"": D R O S S -> but R is forbidden? 

""GROSS"": G R O S S -> R forbidden? 

""PROSS"": not common.

So ""GLOSS"" seems the only common word? 

But we haven't tested G? So it could be.

In ""floss"" we guessed F and it was absent? So G is not forbidden? 

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""GLOSS"".

But let's confirm the feedback we would get? 

If secret word is ""GLOSS"", and we guessed ""floss"":
- F: absent? Yes, because ""GLOSS"" has no F? 
- L: at position 2? Correct? 
- O: at position 3? Correct? 
- S: at position 4? Correct? 
- S: at position 5? Correct? 

So the feedback matches? 

Therefore, we can guess ""GLOSS"" as the next word? But we only have one letter to determine? And it must be G? 

But we have to make a guess? 

Alternatively, we can guess ""GLOSS"" to confirm? 

But since we have only one unknown letter? And it must be G? 

But let's see if there are other possibilities? 

What about ""SLOSH""? But that would be S L O S H? Then position 4 is S? Position 5 is H? But we need position 5 to be S? So not.

""BLEST"": but E and T forbidden? 

No, I think ""GLOSS"" is the only common word? 

So I will guess ""GLOSS"".

But we have to make sure? 

Another word: ""FLOSH"" not a word? 

So <guess>gloss</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, here's the analysis:

### Key Information from Feedback:
1. **Guess 1 (""crane""):**  
   - All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (✗).  
   → **Forbidden letters:** C, R, A, N, E.  
2. **Guess 2 (""moist""):**  
   - M, I, T absent (✗).  
   - O present but wrong position (–).  
   - S correct and in position 4 (✓).  
   → **Forbidden letters added:** M, I, T.  
   → **Known position:** Letter 4 = S.  
   → **O is in the word** but not in position 2.  
3. **Guess 3 (""floss""):**  
   - F absent (✗).  
   - L correct and in position 2 (✓).  
   - O correct and in position 3 (✓).  
   - Both S's correct (positions 4 and 5) (✓).  
   → **Forbidden letters added:** F.  
   → **Known positions:**  
     - Position 2 = L  
     - Position 3 = O  
     - Position 4 = S  
     - Position 5 = S  
   → **Secret word pattern:** `_ L O S S`  

### Deductions:
- The secret word is `?LOSS` (5 letters, ending with ""LOSS"").  
- **First letter must:**  
  - Be a valid English letter not in the forbidden list (C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T, F).  
  - Form a real English word.  
- **Possible candidates:**  
  - `GLOSS` (meaning: shine or surface luster).  
  - Other rare/obscure words like `VLOSS` or `KLOSS` are not valid English. Common words like `BLOSS` or `SLOSS` do not exist.  
- **Conclusion:** `GLOSS` is the **only common, valid English word** fitting the pattern and constraints.  

### Next Guess:
Given the above, the secret word must be **GLOSS**. This guess confirms the first letter (G) and uses no forbidden letters.  

<guess>gloss</guess>",gloss,"We have feedback from Guess 3: ""floss"" -> F(x) L(✓) O(✓) S(✓) S(✓)

Breaking down:
- F: absent (x) -> so F is not in the word.

  Position 3: O
  Position 4: S
  Position 5: S

Feedback: 
  F(x) -> so F is absent? But it's in position 1? So the first letter is not F and F is not in the word.
  L(✓) -> L is correct and in the right position? But L is in position 2? So position 2 is L? 
  O(✓) -> O is correct and in position 3? So position 3 is O?
  S(✓) for the first S? That's position 4? We already knew position 4 is S? 
  S(✓) for the last S? So position 5 is also S? 

But the feedback says: S(✓) S(✓) for the two S's? That means both are correct? So the secret word has S in position 4 and position 5? 

But we already knew position 4 is S? Now we know position 5 is also S? 

Also, from the feedback:
- Position 2: L is correct? So the second letter is L.
- Position 3: O is correct? So the third letter is O.

And F is absent? So the first letter is not F and F is not in the word.

So now we know:
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: O
- Position 4: S
- Position 5: S

And the first letter is unknown? But we know it's not F, and not any of the forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: from previous guesses: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T, and now F.

Also, we know the word has O? But we already have it in position 3.

The secret word pattern: _ L O S S

We need to find the first letter? It must be a letter that is not forbidden? And it must form a valid English word.

Available letters: we have to avoid: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, T, F.

Also, we have used: L, O, S (but S is repeated, but we know the first letter is not S? Because if it were S, then in ""floss"" we would have S at position 1? But position 1 was F and marked absent?

But the secret word has two S's? At positions 4 and 5? So if the first letter were S, then it would be a third S? But we don't know?
