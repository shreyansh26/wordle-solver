We are starting the game. We have no information yet, so we want a starting word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word in Wordle often uses common letters and avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 The most common letters in English 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters and no repeats. Another is ""SLATE"".
 Let me choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, note the example in the game rules started with ""STORM"", but we can pick independently.

 We'll go with ""CRANE"". It contains C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common letters.

 So our first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)
 This means:
   - A and E are in the secret word and in the correct positions (since they are marked with ✓).
   - Specifically, A is the 3rd letter (position 3) and E is the 5th letter (position 5) of the secret word.
   - C, R, and N are not in the word at all (marked with x).

 So the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ E

 We know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   - Has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.
   - Does not contain C, R, or N (since they are not in the word).
   - Includes new letters to test for the remaining positions (1, 2, and 4).

 We have to avoid using the letters C, R, N.

 Let's think of common letters that can appear in the remaining positions.

 The word pattern: _ _ A _ E

 We can try to think of words that fit this pattern.

 Some examples: 
   - plate: P L A T E -> but we have to check if P, L, T are allowed? We haven't seen them yet.
   - slate: S L A T E -> but S is new, L is new, T is new. However, note that in the first guess we didn't have S, L, T.

 But wait: we must avoid R, C, N. So plate and slate are okay in terms of avoiding those.

 However, we also want to maximize information. We can try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, Z.

 We also have vowels: we already have A and E, so the remaining vowel might be I, O, U? But we don't know.

 Let's list some words that fit _ _ A _ E:

   - blade: B L A D E -> but D is new, and we have B and L to test.
   - flame: F L A M E -> F, L, M
   - shade: S H A D E -> S, H, D
   - stake: S T A K E -> S, T, K

 We have to choose one that uses as many new common letters as possible.

 Since we have two positions (1 and 2) and one position (4) to figure out, we can try to cover multiple common letters.

 Another idea: use a word that has repeated letters? But we don't know if there are repeats. However, the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate, but that doesn't mean the secret word doesn't have duplicates.

 But note: in the first guess, we had no duplicate letters, and the feedback didn't indicate any duplicate in the secret word? Actually, we don't know. The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 Since we have two positions to test (1,2, and 4) and we have three positions to fill, we can try to use three new letters.

 Let me try to pick a word that has common letters that haven't been tried.

 We can try ""plate"": 
   - P, L, T are new. But note: we are avoiding R, C, N, which we know are absent.

 However, we must ensure that the word is valid.

 Alternatively, we can try ""saute"": 
   - S, U, T -> but U is a vowel and we already have two vowels? But that's okay.

 But note: the pattern is _ _ A _ E. So ""saute"" would be S A U T E -> wait, that has A in the second position? No, we need A in the third.

 Let me clarify the positions:

   Position 1: first blank
   Position 2: second blank
   Position 3: A (fixed)
   Position 4: fourth blank
   Position 5: E (fixed)

 So ""saute"" is S-A-U-T-E -> that would be: 
   Position1: S, Position2: A -> but we need position3 to be A, so that doesn't fit.

 We must have the third letter as A and the fifth as E.

 So the word must be: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E

 Now, let's think of words that fit:

   - plate: P L A T E -> positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> valid.
   - slate: S L A T E -> valid.
   - state: S T A T E -> but T is repeated? That's okay, but we don't know if T is in the word or not.

 However, we want to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use any other letters.

 Let me choose ""plate"" because it uses three new common letters: P, L, T.

 But note: we have already tested A and E, so we are only testing P, L, T for positions 1,2,4.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more common consonants. Another common starting second guess is ""salet"", but that has S, A, L, E, T -> but note: we have A and E fixed, so we can't change them. And ""salet"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be. But let's stick to common words.

 Another option: ""stale"" -> S T A L E -> but that has E in the fifth? Actually, ""stale"" is S T A L E -> positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). That fits.

 But we have two options: ""plate"" and ""stale"". Which one to choose?

 We can also consider ""shade"": S H A D E -> S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is present. Since we don't have any information about the first, second, and fourth letters, we should choose a word that has common letters in those positions.

 According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters in the first position are S, C, B, T, P, ... but we know C is out. So S, B, T, P.

 In the second position: common letters are A, E, I, O, U, H, ... but we already have A and E fixed, so we are looking for consonants? Actually, the second position can be any letter.

 However, we are constrained by the words that exist.

 Let me choose ""stale"" because it uses S and T which are very common. But note: we have to avoid R, C, N. ""stale"" does not contain these.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had R and it was absent. So we can use S and T.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""spade"": S P A D E -> but that has P and D.

 I think ""stale"" is a good choice because it has S and T, which are common.

 However, note that we have two positions to test: 1, 2, and 4. In ""stale"", we are testing S for position1, T for position2, and L for position4.

 But we can also consider ""skate"": S K A T E -> testing S(1), K(2), T(4). That's also good.

 Since we don't have any information, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:

   S, E, A, O, R, I, L, T, ... (but R is out, and we have A and E already)

 So we want to test S, T, L, etc.

 I think ""stale"" is a good choice.

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""stale"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can use ""slate"", which is also very common.

 Let me go with ""slate"": 
   - S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

 This way, we test S, L, and T.

 So our second guess: ""slate""

 We'll output: <guess>slate</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **A (3rd position)** and **E (5th position)** are correct and in the right spot.
- **C, R, N** are absent from the word.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E`.  
For the next guess, I need to:
- Keep **A** in the 3rd position and **E** in the 5th position.
- Avoid using **C, R, N**.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, D, P**) to gather more information.

I chose **""slate""** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` → **S L A T E**.
- It tests **S** (position 1), **L** (position 2), and **T** (position 4)—all high-frequency letters not yet evaluated.
- It avoids C, R, N.

<guess>slate</guess>",slate,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)

 Let me clarify the positions:

   Position 1: first blank
   Position 2: second blank
   Position 3: A (fixed)
   Position 4: fourth blank
   Position 5: E (fixed)

 So ""saute"" is S-A-U-T-E -> that would be: 
   Position1: S, Position2: A -> but we need position3 to be A, so that doesn't fit.

 We must have the third letter as A and the fifth as E.

 So the word must be: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E

 Now, let's think of words that fit:

   - plate: P L A T E -> positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> valid.
   - slate: S L A T E -> valid.
   - state: S T A T E -> but T is repeated? That's okay, but we don't know if T is in the word or not.

 However, we want to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use any other letters.

 But note: we have already tested A and E, so we are only testing P, L, T for positions 1,2,4.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more common consonants. Another common starting second guess is ""salet"", but that has S, A, L, E, T -> but note: we have A and E fixed, so we can't change them. And ""salet"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be. But let's stick to common words.

 Another option: ""stale"" -> S T A L E -> but that has E in the fifth? Actually, ""stale"" is S T A L E -> positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). That fits.

 But we have two options: ""plate"" and ""stale"". Which one to choose?

 We can also consider ""shade"": S H A D E -> S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is present. Since we don't have any information about the first, second, and fourth letters, we should choose a word that has common letters in those positions.

 According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters in the first position are S, C, B, T, P, ... but we know C is out. So S, B, T, P.

 A good starting word in Wordle often uses common letters and avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 The most common letters in English 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters and no repeats. Another is ""SLATE"".
 Let me choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, note the example in the game rules started with ""STORM"", but we can pick independently.

 Let's list some words that fit _ _ A _ E:

   - blade: B L A D E -> but D is new, and we have B and L to test.
   - flame: F L A M E -> F, L, M
   - shade: S H A D E -> S, H, D
   - stake: S T A K E -> S, T, K

 We have to choose one that uses as many new common letters as possible.

 Since we have two positions (1 and 2) and one position (4) to figure out, we can try to cover multiple common letters.

 Another idea: use a word that has repeated letters? But we don't know if there are repeats. However, the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate, but that doesn't mean the secret word doesn't have duplicates.

 But note: in the first guess, we had no duplicate letters, and the feedback didn't indicate any duplicate in the secret word? Actually, we don't know. The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 Since we have two positions to test (1,2, and 4) and we have three positions to fill, we can try to use three new letters.

 Let me try to pick a word that has common letters that haven't been tried.

 We can try ""plate"": 
   - P, L, T are new. But note: we are avoiding R, C, N, which we know are absent.

 However, we must ensure that the word is valid.

 Alternatively, we can try ""saute"": 
   - S, U, T -> but U is a vowel and we already have two vowels? But that's okay.

 But note: the pattern is _ _ A _ E. So ""saute"" would be S A U T E -> wait, that has A in the second position? No, we need A in the third.

 Let me clarify the positions:

   Position 1: first blank
   Position 2: second blank
   Position 3: A (fixed)
   Position 4: fourth blank
   Position 5: E (fixed)

 So ""saute"" is S-A-U-T-E -> that would be: 
   Position1: S, Position2: A -> but we need position3 to be A, so that doesn't fit.

 We must have the third letter as A and the fifth as E.

 So the word must be: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E

 Now, let's think of words that fit:

   - plate: P L A T E -> positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> valid.
   - slate: S L A T E -> valid.
   - state: S T A T E -> but T is repeated? That's okay, but we don't know if T is in the word or not.

 However, we want to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use any other letters.

 Let me choose ""plate"" because it uses three new common letters: P, L, T.

 But note: we have already tested A and E, so we are only testing P, L, T for positions 1,2,4.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more common consonants. Another common starting second guess is ""salet"", but that has S, A, L, E, T -> but note: we have A and E fixed, so we can't change them. And ""salet"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be. But let's stick to common words.

 Another option: ""stale"" -> S T A L E -> but that has E in the fifth? Actually, ""stale"" is S T A L E -> positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). That fits.

 But we have two options: ""plate"" and ""stale"". Which one to choose?

 We can also consider ""shade"": S H A D E -> S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is present. Since we don't have any information about the first, second, and fourth letters, we should choose a word that has common letters in those positions.

 According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters in the first position are S, C, B, T, P, ... but we know C is out. So S, B, T, P.

 In the second position: common letters are A, E, I, O, U, H, ... but we already have A and E fixed, so we are looking for consonants? Actually, the second position can be any letter.

 However, we are constrained by the words that exist.

 Let me choose ""stale"" because it uses S and T which are very common. But note: we have to avoid R, C, N. ""stale"" does not contain these.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had R and it was absent. So we can use S and T.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""spade"": S P A D E -> but that has P and D.

 I think ""stale"" is a good choice because it has S and T, which are common.

 However, note that we have two positions to test: 1, 2, and 4. In ""stale"", we are testing S for position1, T for position2, and L for position4.

 But we can also consider ""skate"": S K A T E -> testing S(1), K(2), T(4). That's also good.

 Since we don't have any information, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:

   S, E, A, O, R, I, L, T, ... (but R is out, and we have A and E already)

 So we want to test S, T, L, etc.

 I think ""stale"" is a good choice.

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""stale"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can use ""slate"", which is also very common.

 Let me go with ""slate"": 
   - S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

 This way, we test S, L, and T.

 So our second guess: ""slate""

 We'll output: <guess>slate</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **A (3rd position)** and **E (5th position)** are correct and in the right spot.
- **C, R, N** are absent from the word.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E`.  
For the next guess, I need to:
- Keep **A** in the 3rd position and **E** in the 5th position.
- Avoid using **C, R, N**.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, D, P**) to gather more information.

I chose **""slate""** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` → **S L A T E**.
- It tests **S** (position 1), **L** (position 2), and **T** (position 4)—all high-frequency letters not yet evaluated.
- It avoids C, R, N.

We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
   - This tells us that A is in position 3 and E is in position 5, and C, R, N are absent.
   - Secret word pattern: _ _ A _ E

2. Guess 2: slate -> S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   - S, L, T are absent from the secret word (since all are marked 'x').

So now we know the following:
- The secret word is of the form: _ _ A _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L, T

We need to avoid using these absent letters in our next guess.

Additionally, we know that the word must contain A and E (with A in position 3 and E in position 5), but we don't know about the other letters.

We have to guess letters that are not in the set {C, R, N, S, L, T}.

Let's list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, R, N, S, L, T.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word that fits the pattern _ _ A _ E and only uses letters from the available set.

We have positions 1, 2, and 4 to fill.

Possible words:

- Let's try to think of words that end with 'E' and have 'A' in the third position.

Some ideas:
- blade: but B, L, D -> L is absent (from guess2, L is marked x), so we cannot use L.
- flame: F, L, M -> L is absent, so no.
- shake: S, H, K -> S is absent, so no.

We must avoid S, L, T, C, R, N.

What about ""gaffe""? But ""gaffe"" is G A F F E -> but then A is in position 2, not 3. We need A in position 3.

Pattern must be [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E.

Let's think of words:
- ""grave"": G R A V E -> but R is absent (from guess1) and V is new. However, R is not allowed because it was absent in guess1. So skip.
- ""pause"": P A U S E -> but S is absent and also A is in position 2? No, here: P(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> no, because we need position 3 to be A, not U.
- ""maple"": M A P L E -> again, A in position 2, and L is absent.

We need to find words where the third letter is A and the fifth is E.

Another idea: ""abase"": A B A S E -> pattern: A(1) B(2) A(3) S(4) E(5). But S is absent, and also the first letter A: we don't know if A might appear twice? But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was correct, but it might also be in other positions? However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed A in position 3 as correct, but there could be another A? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters explicitly. But note:

In ""crane"": we had A as correct in position 3, but if there was another A, and we didn't test it in other positions, we wouldn't know. Similarly in ""slate"", we had A in position 3 correct, and no other A was tested.

However, we cannot rule out the possibility of multiple A's. But for now, let's focus on words without the absent letters.

Possible words that fit _ _ A _ E and avoid C,R,N,S,L,T:

- ""name"": but only 4 letters? No, we need 5 letters.

Let's search for 5-letter words ending with E and A in the third position.

Some possibilities:
- ""gape"": too short? No, 4 letters.

Using a word finder or by brainstorming:

- ""bade"": too short? Again, 4 letters? Wait, no, ""bade"" is 4 letters? We need 5-letter words.

We must have exactly 5 letters.

Another idea: ""quake"": Q U A K E -> pattern: Q(1) U(2) A(3) K(4) E(5). Now, Q, U, K: none of them are in our absent list? Let's check: absent are C,R,N,S,L,T. So Q, U, K are allowed.

But is ""quake"" valid? Yes.

However, we are not sure if these letters are common.

Another word: ""vague"": V A G U E -> but A is in position 2? No: V(1), A(2), G(3), U(4), E(5). So A is in position 2, not 3. Incorrect pattern.

""jade"": but 4 letters.

""fame"": 4 letters.

Maybe ""aware"": A W A R E -> but A is in position 1? Pattern: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), E(5). But R is absent, so we cannot use R.

What about ""image""? I M A G E -> I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5). This fits the pattern. Letters: I, M, G are not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,S,L,T. So I, M, G are fine.

So ""image"" is I M A G E.

Another possibility: ""paged"": P A G E D -> but that's 5 letters? Pattern: P(1) A(2) G(3) E(4) D(5) -> here A is in position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit.

""gauge"": G A U G E -> A in position 2.

""quake"": we had that: Q(1) U(2) A(3) K(4) E(5) -> acceptable.

""drape"": D R A P E -> R is absent, so no.

""maize"": M A I Z E -> but A is in position 2? Pattern: M(1) A(2) I(3) Z(4) E(5) -> A is in position 2, not 3. We need the third letter to be A.

So we need: [1][2]A[4]E.

Other words: 
- ""dance"": D A N C E -> but N and C are absent, so no.
- ""fable"": F A B L E -> L absent.
- ""cable"": C absent.

Maybe ""abate"": A B A T E -> but T is absent (from guess2: T is x) and S,L,T are absent. So T is out.

What about ""beige"": B E I G E -> E is in position 2? Pattern: B(1) E(2) I(3) G(4) E(5) -> E in position 2 and 5? We know E is in position 5, but we don't have any information about position 2 yet. However, the third letter is I, not A. So doesn't fit.

Back to ""image"": I M A G E -> positions: I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5). All letters I, M, G are allowed.

Quake: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> Q, U, K allowed.

But ""image"" uses more common letters? M, G, I are more common than Q and U.

Another word: ""badge"": B A D G E -> A in position 2? No.

""value"": V A L U E -> L absent.

""hazel"": H A Z E L -> only 5 letters? Pattern: H(1), A(2), Z(3), E(4), L(5) -> no, because we need E in position 5? Wait, E is in position 4, and we have L in position 5? But the secret word has E in position 5, so position 4 cannot be E? Our pattern is _ _ A _ E, so the fourth letter must be something else and fifth is E.

Another idea: ""brake"": B R A K E -> R is absent.

""flake"": F L A K E -> L absent.

""jake"": not 5 letters.

""ovate"": O V A T E -> but T is absent.

""newer"": but E in position 5? Pattern: N E W E R -> N is absent? Also, no A in position 3.

""adept"": A D E P T -> doesn't fit pattern.

Perhaps ""baghe"": not a word.

I think ""image"" and ""quake"" are possible.

Another word: ""faine"" - not common? Or ""faire"" - not standard.

""maize"": but again, A is in position 2.

Wait, we need the third letter to be A, so only words like [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E.

Let me think of more:
- ""glade"": G L A D E -> L absent? Guess2 said L is x, so no.
- ""shade"": S H A D E -> S absent? Guess2 said S is x, so no.

What about ""above""? A B O V E -> pattern: A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Third letter is O, not A.

""hate"": too short.

""pate"": too short.

""diode"": not matching.

Maybe ""haute"": H A U T E -> T absent.

""gauze"": G A U E? Wait, G A U Z E -> pattern: G(1), A(2), U(3), Z(4), E(5) -> third letter U, not A.

""payee"": P A Y E E -> but E is in position 4? Pattern: P(1), A(2), Y(3), E(4), E(5) -> but we need E in position 5? And third letter is Y. So no.

I'm struggling. Let's try ""mange"": M A N G E -> N is absent? Yes, from guess1, N is x.

""large"": L, R absent.

""barge"": B A R G E -> R absent.

""vague"": V A G U E -> A in position 2.

But we have ""image"": I M A G E

""quake"": Q U A K E

""ozone"": not matching pattern.

Another one: ""exile"": E X I L E -> L absent and pattern doesn't fit.

""agape"": A G A P E -> but that's A in position1 and 3? Pattern: A(1) G(2) A(3) P(4) E(5). So that fits. Now, letters: A, G, P. We know A is already present and in position3, but we didn't test A in position1. And we know G and P haven't been tested? And A might be duplicated? Also, avoid C,R,N,S,L,T: G and P are not in that set? And A is allowed.

So ""agape"": A G A P E

But note: in guess1, we had A in position3 and it was correct, but we didn't test A in other positions. So it's possible.

Similarly, ""abate"" but T absent.

""agape"" is a valid word meaning a state of wonder.

Another option: ""afire"": A F I R E -> but R is absent.

""aside"": A S I D E -> S is absent.

So few options: ""image"", ""quake"", ""agape"".

We have to pick one.

We could also have ""bake"": too short? Or ""bakes"" - but S is absent.

Let's consider ""jape"" - too short.

""gaffe"": G A F F E -> pattern: G(1) A(2) F(3) F(4) E(5) -> third letter F, not A.

I think ""image"", ""agape"", and ""quake"" are among the few.

Which one gives us more information?

""image"" uses I, M, G.
""agape"" uses A, G, P. But note: we already know A is in the word? And we know it is in position 3. But if we use A in position1, we might get:
- If A is also in the secret word at position1, it would be marked with '-' or '✓'? Actually, if the secret word has A in position1, we would get ✓ for position1 and ✓ for position3? But we don't know.

Similarly, ""quake"" uses Q, U, K which are less common, so it might be less informative.

Therefore, I prefer ""image"" or ""agape"".

Let me list the positions:

Secret must be: [1][2]A[4]E

In ""agape"": 
- position1: A -> if the secret has A at position1, we'd get ✓ for position1? But we know A is at position3. Could there be two A's? Yes.
- position2: G
- position4: P

In ""image"":
- position1: I
- position2: M
- position4: G

Since we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters, both are possible.

But to be safe, let's choose ""image"" because it tests three entirely new letters: I, M, G.

Whereas ""agape"" tests G and P, but also A in position1 which we already have in the word (but we don't know where else it might be).

Since we have limited guesses, we want to maximize new information.

Therefore, I'll choose ""image"".

We'll guess ""image"".

But let's confirm: is ""image"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

So: <guess>image</guess>

We must remember the absent letters: C,R,N,S,L,T are not in the word.

By using ""image"", if we get new 'x', then we know I, M, G are absent too? Or if we get some marks, we'll know more.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **crane**: A (3rd) and E (5th) are correct; C, R, N are absent.
- **slate**: A (3rd) and E (5th) are correct; S, L, T are absent.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E` (with A in position 3 and E in position 5).  
Absent letters to avoid: **C, R, N, S, L, T**.

For the next guess:
- Keep **A** in position 3 and **E** in position 5.
- Test new common letters not in the absent set (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P).
- Prioritize high-frequency letters to maximize information.

I chose **""image""** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` → **I M A G E**.
- Uses **I**, **M**, and **G** (all new, high-frequency letters not excluded).
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, L, T).

This tests:
- Position 1: **I** (new)
- Position 2: **M** (new)
- Position 4: **G** (new)

<guess>image</guess>",image,"We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
   - This tells us that A is in position 3 and E is in position 5, and C, R, N are absent.
   - Secret word pattern: _ _ A _ E

2. Guess 2: slate -> S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   - S, L, T are absent from the secret word (since all are marked 'x').

So now we know the following:
- The secret word is of the form: _ _ A _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L, T

We need to avoid using these absent letters in our next guess.

Additionally, we know that the word must contain A and E (with A in position 3 and E in position 5), but we don't know about the other letters.

We have to guess letters that are not in the set {C, R, N, S, L, T}.

Let's list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, R, N, S, L, T.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word that fits the pattern _ _ A _ E and only uses letters from the available set.

We have positions 1, 2, and 4 to fill.

Possible words:

- Let's try to think of words that end with 'E' and have 'A' in the third position.

Some ideas:
- blade: but B, L, D -> L is absent (from guess2, L is marked x), so we cannot use L.
- flame: F, L, M -> L is absent, so no.
- shake: S, H, K -> S is absent, so no.

We must avoid S, L, T, C, R, N.

What about ""gaffe""? But ""gaffe"" is G A F F E -> but then A is in position 2, not 3. We need A in position 3.

Pattern must be [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E.

Let's think of words:
- ""grave"": G R A V E -> but R is absent (from guess1) and V is new. However, R is not allowed because it was absent in guess1. So skip.
- ""pause"": P A U S E -> but S is absent and also A is in position 2? No, here: P(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> no, because we need position 3 to be A, not U.
- ""maple"": M A P L E -> again, A in position 2, and L is absent.

We need to find words where the third letter is A and the fifth is E.

Another idea: ""abase"": A B A S E -> pattern: A(1) B(2) A(3) S(4) E(5). But S is absent, and also the first letter A: we don't know if A might appear twice? But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was correct, but it might also be in other positions? However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed A in position 3 as correct, but there could be another A? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters explicitly. But note:

In ""crane"": we had A as correct in position 3, but if there was another A, and we didn't test it in other positions, we wouldn't know. Similarly in ""slate"", we had A in position 3 correct, and no other A was tested.

However, we cannot rule out the possibility of multiple A's. But for now, let's focus on words without the absent letters.

Possible words that fit _ _ A _ E and avoid C,R,N,S,L,T:

- ""name"": but only 4 letters? No, we need 5 letters.

Let's search for 5-letter words ending with E and A in the third position.

Some possibilities:
- ""gape"": too short? No, 4 letters.

Using a word finder or by brainstorming:

- ""bade"": too short? Again, 4 letters? Wait, no, ""bade"" is 4 letters? We need 5-letter words.

We must have exactly 5 letters.

Another idea: ""quake"": Q U A K E -> pattern: Q(1) U(2) A(3) K(4) E(5). Now, Q, U, K: none of them are in our absent list? Let's check: absent are C,R,N,S,L,T. So Q, U, K are allowed.

But is ""quake"" valid? Yes.

However, we are not sure if these letters are common.

Another word: ""vague"": V A G U E -> but A is in position 2? No: V(1), A(2), G(3), U(4), E(5). So A is in position 2, not 3. Incorrect pattern.

""jade"": but 4 letters.

""fame"": 4 letters.

Maybe ""aware"": A W A R E -> but A is in position 1? Pattern: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), E(5). But R is absent, so we cannot use R.

What about ""image""? I M A G E -> I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5). This fits the pattern. Letters: I, M, G are not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,S,L,T. So I, M, G are fine.

So ""image"" is I M A G E.

Another possibility: ""paged"": P A G E D -> but that's 5 letters? Pattern: P(1) A(2) G(3) E(4) D(5) -> here A is in position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit.

""gauge"": G A U G E -> A in position 2.

""quake"": we had that: Q(1) U(2) A(3) K(4) E(5) -> acceptable.

""drape"": D R A P E -> R is absent, so no.

""maize"": M A I Z E -> but A is in position 2? Pattern: M(1) A(2) I(3) Z(4) E(5) -> A is in position 2, not 3. We need the third letter to be A.

So we need: [1][2]A[4]E.

Other words: 
- ""dance"": D A N C E -> but N and C are absent, so no.
- ""fable"": F A B L E -> L absent.
- ""cable"": C absent.

Maybe ""abate"": A B A T E -> but T is absent (from guess2: T is x) and S,L,T are absent. So T is out.

What about ""beige"": B E I G E -> E is in position 2? Pattern: B(1) E(2) I(3) G(4) E(5) -> E in position 2 and 5? We know E is in position 5, but we don't have any information about position 2 yet. However, the third letter is I, not A. So doesn't fit.

Back to ""image"": I M A G E -> positions: I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5). All letters I, M, G are allowed.

Quake: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> Q, U, K allowed.

But ""image"" uses more common letters? M, G, I are more common than Q and U.

Another word: ""badge"": B A D G E -> A in position 2? No.

""value"": V A L U E -> L absent.

""hazel"": H A Z E L -> only 5 letters? Pattern: H(1), A(2), Z(3), E(4), L(5) -> no, because we need E in position 5? Wait, E is in position 4, and we have L in position 5? But the secret word has E in position 5, so position 4 cannot be E? Our pattern is _ _ A _ E, so the fourth letter must be something else and fifth is E.

Another idea: ""brake"": B R A K E -> R is absent.

""flake"": F L A K E -> L absent.

""jake"": not 5 letters.

""ovate"": O V A T E -> but T is absent.

""newer"": but E in position 5? Pattern: N E W E R -> N is absent? Also, no A in position 3.

""adept"": A D E P T -> doesn't fit pattern.

Perhaps ""baghe"": not a word.

I think ""image"" and ""quake"" are possible.

Another word: ""faine"" - not common? Or ""faire"" - not standard.

""maize"": but again, A is in position 2.

Wait, we need the third letter to be A, so only words like [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E.

Let me think of more:
- ""glade"": G L A D E -> L absent? Guess2 said L is x, so no.
- ""shade"": S H A D E -> S absent? Guess2 said S is x, so no.

What about ""above""? A B O V E -> pattern: A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Third letter is O, not A.

""hate"": too short.

""pate"": too short.

""diode"": not matching.

Maybe ""haute"": H A U T E -> T absent.

""gauze"": G A U E? Wait, G A U Z E -> pattern: G(1), A(2), U(3), Z(4), E(5) -> third letter U, not A.

""payee"": P A Y E E -> but E is in position 4? Pattern: P(1), A(2), Y(3), E(4), E(5) -> but we need E in position 5? And third letter is Y. So no.

I'm struggling. Let's try ""mange"": M A N G E -> N is absent? Yes, from guess1, N is x.

""large"": L, R absent.

""barge"": B A R G E -> R absent.

""vague"": V A G U E -> A in position 2.

But we have ""image"": I M A G E

""quake"": Q U A K E

""ozone"": not matching pattern.

Another one: ""exile"": E X I L E -> L absent and pattern doesn't fit.

""agape"": A G A P E -> but that's A in position1 and 3? Pattern: A(1) G(2) A(3) P(4) E(5). So that fits. Now, letters: A, G, P. We know A is already present and in position3, but we didn't test A in position1. And we know G and P haven't been tested? And A might be duplicated? Also, avoid C,R,N,S,L,T: G and P are not in that set? And A is allowed.

So ""agape"": A G A P E

But note: in guess1, we had A in position3 and it was correct, but we didn't test A in other positions. So it's possible.

Similarly, ""abate"" but T absent.

""agape"" is a valid word meaning a state of wonder.

Another option: ""afire"": A F I R E -> but R is absent.

""aside"": A S I D E -> S is absent.

So few options: ""image"", ""quake"", ""agape"".

We have to pick one.

We could also have ""bake"": too short? Or ""bakes"" - but S is absent.

Let's consider ""jape"" - too short.

""gaffe"": G A F F E -> pattern: G(1) A(2) F(3) F(4) E(5) -> third letter F, not A.

I think ""image"", ""agape"", and ""quake"" are among the few.

Which one gives us more information?

""image"" uses I, M, G.
""agape"" uses A, G, P. But note: we already know A is in the word? And we know it is in position 3. But if we use A in position1, we might get:
- If A is also in the secret word at position1, it would be marked with '-' or '✓'? Actually, if the secret word has A in position1, we would get ✓ for position1 and ✓ for position3? But we don't know.

Similarly, ""quake"" uses Q, U, K which are less common, so it might be less informative.

Therefore, I prefer ""image"" or ""agape"".

Let me list the positions:

Secret must be: [1][2]A[4]E

In ""agape"": 
- position1: A -> if the secret has A at position1, we'd get ✓ for position1? But we know A is at position3. Could there be two A's? Yes.
- position2: G
- position4: P

In ""image"":
- position1: I
- position2: M
- position4: G

Since we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters, both are possible.

But to be safe, let's choose ""image"" because it tests three entirely new letters: I, M, G.

Whereas ""agape"" tests G and P, but also A in position1 which we already have in the word (but we don't know where else it might be).

Since we have limited guesses, we want to maximize new information.

Therefore, I'll choose ""image"".

We'll guess ""image"".

But let's confirm: is ""image"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

So: <guess>image</guess>

We must remember the absent letters: C,R,N,S,L,T are not in the word.

By using ""image"", if we get new 'x', then we know I, M, G are absent too? Or if we get some marks, we'll know more.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **crane**: A (3rd) and E (5th) are correct; C, R, N are absent.
- **slate**: A (3rd) and E (5th) are correct; S, L, T are absent.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E` (with A in position 3 and E in position 5).  
Absent letters to avoid: **C, R, N, S, L, T**.

For the next guess:
- Keep **A** in position 3 and **E** in position 5.
- Test new common letters not in the absent set (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P).
- Prioritize high-frequency letters to maximize information.

I chose **""image""** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` → **I M A G E**.
- Uses **I**, **M**, and **G** (all new, high-frequency letters not excluded).
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, L, T).

This tests:
- Position 1: **I** (new)
- Position 2: **M** (new)
- Position 4: **G** (new)",Guess 3: image -> FEEDBACK: I(x) M(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no information yet, so we want a starting word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word in Wordle often uses common letters and avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 The most common letters in English 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters and no repeats. Another is ""SLATE"".
 Let me choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, note the example in the game rules started with ""STORM"", but we can pick independently.

 We'll go with ""CRANE"". It contains C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common letters.

 So our first guess is: CRANE

 But note: we must output in the specified XML-like format.

 Let me format the response accordingly.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)
 This means:
   - A and E are in the secret word and in the correct positions (since they are marked with ✓).
   - Specifically, A is the 3rd letter (position 3) and E is the 5th letter (position 5) of the secret word.
   - C, R, and N are not in the word at all (marked with x).

 So the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ E

 We know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   - Has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.
   - Does not contain C, R, or N (since they are not in the word).
   - Includes new letters to test for the remaining positions (1, 2, and 4).

 We have to avoid using the letters C, R, N.

 Let's think of common letters that can appear in the remaining positions.

 The word pattern: _ _ A _ E

 We can try to think of words that fit this pattern.

 Some examples: 
   - plate: P L A T E -> but we have to check if P, L, T are allowed? We haven't seen them yet.
   - slate: S L A T E -> but S is new, L is new, T is new. However, note that in the first guess we didn't have S, L, T.

 But wait: we must avoid R, C, N. So plate and slate are okay in terms of avoiding those.

 However, we also want to maximize information. We can try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, Z.

 We also have vowels: we already have A and E, so the remaining vowel might be I, O, U? But we don't know.

 Let's list some words that fit _ _ A _ E:

   - blade: B L A D E -> but D is new, and we have B and L to test.
   - flame: F L A M E -> F, L, M
   - shade: S H A D E -> S, H, D
   - stake: S T A K E -> S, T, K

 We have to choose one that uses as many new common letters as possible.

 Since we have two positions (1 and 2) and one position (4) to figure out, we can try to cover multiple common letters.

 Another idea: use a word that has repeated letters? But we don't know if there are repeats. However, the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate, but that doesn't mean the secret word doesn't have duplicates.

 But note: in the first guess, we had no duplicate letters, and the feedback didn't indicate any duplicate in the secret word? Actually, we don't know. The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 Since we have two positions to test (1,2, and 4) and we have three positions to fill, we can try to use three new letters.

 Let me try to pick a word that has common letters that haven't been tried.

 We can try ""plate"": 
   - P, L, T are new. But note: we are avoiding R, C, N, which we know are absent.

 However, we must ensure that the word is valid.

 Alternatively, we can try ""saute"": 
   - S, U, T -> but U is a vowel and we already have two vowels? But that's okay.

 But note: the pattern is _ _ A _ E. So ""saute"" would be S A U T E -> wait, that has A in the second position? No, we need A in the third.

 Let me clarify the positions:

   Position 1: first blank
   Position 2: second blank
   Position 3: A (fixed)
   Position 4: fourth blank
   Position 5: E (fixed)

 So ""saute"" is S-A-U-T-E -> that would be: 
   Position1: S, Position2: A -> but we need position3 to be A, so that doesn't fit.

 We must have the third letter as A and the fifth as E.

 So the word must be: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E

 Now, let's think of words that fit:

   - plate: P L A T E -> positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> valid.
   - slate: S L A T E -> valid.
   - state: S T A T E -> but T is repeated? That's okay, but we don't know if T is in the word or not.

 However, we want to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use any other letters.

 Let me choose ""plate"" because it uses three new common letters: P, L, T.

 But note: we have already tested A and E, so we are only testing P, L, T for positions 1,2,4.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more common consonants. Another common starting second guess is ""salet"", but that has S, A, L, E, T -> but note: we have A and E fixed, so we can't change them. And ""salet"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be. But let's stick to common words.

 Another option: ""stale"" -> S T A L E -> but that has E in the fifth? Actually, ""stale"" is S T A L E -> positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). That fits.

 But we have two options: ""plate"" and ""stale"". Which one to choose?

 We can also consider ""shade"": S H A D E -> S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is present. Since we don't have any information about the first, second, and fourth letters, we should choose a word that has common letters in those positions.

 According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters in the first position are S, C, B, T, P, ... but we know C is out. So S, B, T, P.

 In the second position: common letters are A, E, I, O, U, H, ... but we already have A and E fixed, so we are looking for consonants? Actually, the second position can be any letter.

 However, we are constrained by the words that exist.

 Let me choose ""stale"" because it uses S and T which are very common. But note: we have to avoid R, C, N. ""stale"" does not contain these.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had R and it was absent. So we can use S and T.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""spade"": S P A D E -> but that has P and D.

 I think ""stale"" is a good choice because it has S and T, which are common.

 However, note that we have two positions to test: 1, 2, and 4. In ""stale"", we are testing S for position1, T for position2, and L for position4.

 But we can also consider ""skate"": S K A T E -> testing S(1), K(2), T(4). That's also good.

 Since we don't have any information, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:

   S, E, A, O, R, I, L, T, ... (but R is out, and we have A and E already)

 So we want to test S, T, L, etc.

 I think ""stale"" is a good choice.

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""stale"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can use ""slate"", which is also very common.

 Let me go with ""slate"": 
   - S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

 This way, we test S, L, and T.

 So our second guess: ""slate""

 We'll output: <guess>slate</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **A (3rd position)** and **E (5th position)** are correct and in the right spot.
- **C, R, N** are absent from the word.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E`.  
For the next guess, I need to:
- Keep **A** in the 3rd position and **E** in the 5th position.
- Avoid using **C, R, N**.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, D, P**) to gather more information.

I chose **""slate""** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` → **S L A T E**.
- It tests **S** (position 1), **L** (position 2), and **T** (position 4)—all high-frequency letters not yet evaluated.
- It avoids C, R, N.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
   - This tells us that A is in position 3 and E is in position 5, and C, R, N are absent.
   - Secret word pattern: _ _ A _ E

2. Guess 2: slate -> S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   - S, L, T are absent from the secret word (since all are marked 'x').

So now we know the following:
- The secret word is of the form: _ _ A _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L, T

We need to avoid using these absent letters in our next guess.

Additionally, we know that the word must contain A and E (with A in position 3 and E in position 5), but we don't know about the other letters.

We have to guess letters that are not in the set {C, R, N, S, L, T}.

Let's list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, R, N, S, L, T.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word that fits the pattern _ _ A _ E and only uses letters from the available set.

We have positions 1, 2, and 4 to fill.

Possible words:

- Let's try to think of words that end with 'E' and have 'A' in the third position.

Some ideas:
- blade: but B, L, D -> L is absent (from guess2, L is marked x), so we cannot use L.
- flame: F, L, M -> L is absent, so no.
- shake: S, H, K -> S is absent, so no.

We must avoid S, L, T, C, R, N.

What about ""gaffe""? But ""gaffe"" is G A F F E -> but then A is in position 2, not 3. We need A in position 3.

Pattern must be [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E.

Let's think of words:
- ""grave"": G R A V E -> but R is absent (from guess1) and V is new. However, R is not allowed because it was absent in guess1. So skip.
- ""pause"": P A U S E -> but S is absent and also A is in position 2? No, here: P(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> no, because we need position 3 to be A, not U.
- ""maple"": M A P L E -> again, A in position 2, and L is absent.

We need to find words where the third letter is A and the fifth is E.

Another idea: ""abase"": A B A S E -> pattern: A(1) B(2) A(3) S(4) E(5). But S is absent, and also the first letter A: we don't know if A might appear twice? But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was correct, but it might also be in other positions? However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed A in position 3 as correct, but there could be another A? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters explicitly. But note:

In ""crane"": we had A as correct in position 3, but if there was another A, and we didn't test it in other positions, we wouldn't know. Similarly in ""slate"", we had A in position 3 correct, and no other A was tested.

However, we cannot rule out the possibility of multiple A's. But for now, let's focus on words without the absent letters.

Possible words that fit _ _ A _ E and avoid C,R,N,S,L,T:

- ""name"": but only 4 letters? No, we need 5 letters.

Let's search for 5-letter words ending with E and A in the third position.

Some possibilities:
- ""gape"": too short? No, 4 letters.

Using a word finder or by brainstorming:

- ""bade"": too short? Again, 4 letters? Wait, no, ""bade"" is 4 letters? We need 5-letter words.

We must have exactly 5 letters.

Another idea: ""quake"": Q U A K E -> pattern: Q(1) U(2) A(3) K(4) E(5). Now, Q, U, K: none of them are in our absent list? Let's check: absent are C,R,N,S,L,T. So Q, U, K are allowed.

But is ""quake"" valid? Yes.

However, we are not sure if these letters are common.

Another word: ""vague"": V A G U E -> but A is in position 2? No: V(1), A(2), G(3), U(4), E(5). So A is in position 2, not 3. Incorrect pattern.

""jade"": but 4 letters.

""fame"": 4 letters.

Maybe ""aware"": A W A R E -> but A is in position 1? Pattern: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), E(5). But R is absent, so we cannot use R.

What about ""image""? I M A G E -> I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5). This fits the pattern. Letters: I, M, G are not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,S,L,T. So I, M, G are fine.

So ""image"" is I M A G E.

Another possibility: ""paged"": P A G E D -> but that's 5 letters? Pattern: P(1) A(2) G(3) E(4) D(5) -> here A is in position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit.

""gauge"": G A U G E -> A in position 2.

""quake"": we had that: Q(1) U(2) A(3) K(4) E(5) -> acceptable.

""drape"": D R A P E -> R is absent, so no.

""maize"": M A I Z E -> but A is in position 2? Pattern: M(1) A(2) I(3) Z(4) E(5) -> A is in position 2, not 3. We need the third letter to be A.

So we need: [1][2]A[4]E.

Other words: 
- ""dance"": D A N C E -> but N and C are absent, so no.
- ""fable"": F A B L E -> L absent.
- ""cable"": C absent.

Maybe ""abate"": A B A T E -> but T is absent (from guess2: T is x) and S,L,T are absent. So T is out.

What about ""beige"": B E I G E -> E is in position 2? Pattern: B(1) E(2) I(3) G(4) E(5) -> E in position 2 and 5? We know E is in position 5, but we don't have any information about position 2 yet. However, the third letter is I, not A. So doesn't fit.

Back to ""image"": I M A G E -> positions: I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5). All letters I, M, G are allowed.

Quake: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> Q, U, K allowed.

But ""image"" uses more common letters? M, G, I are more common than Q and U.

Another word: ""badge"": B A D G E -> A in position 2? No.

""value"": V A L U E -> L absent.

""hazel"": H A Z E L -> only 5 letters? Pattern: H(1), A(2), Z(3), E(4), L(5) -> no, because we need E in position 5? Wait, E is in position 4, and we have L in position 5? But the secret word has E in position 5, so position 4 cannot be E? Our pattern is _ _ A _ E, so the fourth letter must be something else and fifth is E.

Another idea: ""brake"": B R A K E -> R is absent.

""flake"": F L A K E -> L absent.

""jake"": not 5 letters.

""ovate"": O V A T E -> but T is absent.

""newer"": but E in position 5? Pattern: N E W E R -> N is absent? Also, no A in position 3.

""adept"": A D E P T -> doesn't fit pattern.

Perhaps ""baghe"": not a word.

I think ""image"" and ""quake"" are possible.

Another word: ""faine"" - not common? Or ""faire"" - not standard.

""maize"": but again, A is in position 2.

Wait, we need the third letter to be A, so only words like [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E.

Let me think of more:
- ""glade"": G L A D E -> L absent? Guess2 said L is x, so no.
- ""shade"": S H A D E -> S absent? Guess2 said S is x, so no.

What about ""above""? A B O V E -> pattern: A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Third letter is O, not A.

""hate"": too short.

""pate"": too short.

""diode"": not matching.

Maybe ""haute"": H A U T E -> T absent.

""gauze"": G A U E? Wait, G A U Z E -> pattern: G(1), A(2), U(3), Z(4), E(5) -> third letter U, not A.

""payee"": P A Y E E -> but E is in position 4? Pattern: P(1), A(2), Y(3), E(4), E(5) -> but we need E in position 5? And third letter is Y. So no.

I'm struggling. Let's try ""mange"": M A N G E -> N is absent? Yes, from guess1, N is x.

""large"": L, R absent.

""barge"": B A R G E -> R absent.

""vague"": V A G U E -> A in position 2.

But we have ""image"": I M A G E

""quake"": Q U A K E

""ozone"": not matching pattern.

Another one: ""exile"": E X I L E -> L absent and pattern doesn't fit.

""agape"": A G A P E -> but that's A in position1 and 3? Pattern: A(1) G(2) A(3) P(4) E(5). So that fits. Now, letters: A, G, P. We know A is already present and in position3, but we didn't test A in position1. And we know G and P haven't been tested? And A might be duplicated? Also, avoid C,R,N,S,L,T: G and P are not in that set? And A is allowed.

So ""agape"": A G A P E

But note: in guess1, we had A in position3 and it was correct, but we didn't test A in other positions. So it's possible.

Similarly, ""abate"" but T absent.

""agape"" is a valid word meaning a state of wonder.

Another option: ""afire"": A F I R E -> but R is absent.

""aside"": A S I D E -> S is absent.

So few options: ""image"", ""quake"", ""agape"".

We have to pick one.

We could also have ""bake"": too short? Or ""bakes"" - but S is absent.

Let's consider ""jape"" - too short.

""gaffe"": G A F F E -> pattern: G(1) A(2) F(3) F(4) E(5) -> third letter F, not A.

I think ""image"", ""agape"", and ""quake"" are among the few.

Which one gives us more information?

""image"" uses I, M, G.
""agape"" uses A, G, P. But note: we already know A is in the word? And we know it is in position 3. But if we use A in position1, we might get:
- If A is also in the secret word at position1, it would be marked with '-' or '✓'? Actually, if the secret word has A in position1, we would get ✓ for position1 and ✓ for position3? But we don't know.

Similarly, ""quake"" uses Q, U, K which are less common, so it might be less informative.

Therefore, I prefer ""image"" or ""agape"".

Let me list the positions:

Secret must be: [1][2]A[4]E

In ""agape"": 
- position1: A -> if the secret has A at position1, we'd get ✓ for position1? But we know A is at position3. Could there be two A's? Yes.
- position2: G
- position4: P

In ""image"":
- position1: I
- position2: M
- position4: G

Since we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters, both are possible.

But to be safe, let's choose ""image"" because it tests three entirely new letters: I, M, G.

Whereas ""agape"" tests G and P, but also A in position1 which we already have in the word (but we don't know where else it might be).

Since we have limited guesses, we want to maximize new information.

Therefore, I'll choose ""image"".

We'll guess ""image"".

But let's confirm: is ""image"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

So: <guess>image</guess>

We must remember the absent letters: C,R,N,S,L,T are not in the word.

By using ""image"", if we get new 'x', then we know I, M, G are absent too? Or if we get some marks, we'll know more.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **crane**: A (3rd) and E (5th) are correct; C, R, N are absent.
- **slate**: A (3rd) and E (5th) are correct; S, L, T are absent.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E` (with A in position 3 and E in position 5).  
Absent letters to avoid: **C, R, N, S, L, T**.

For the next guess:
- Keep **A** in position 3 and **E** in position 5.
- Test new common letters not in the absent set (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P).
- Prioritize high-frequency letters to maximize information.

I chose **""image""** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` → **I M A G E**.
- Uses **I**, **M**, and **G** (all new, high-frequency letters not excluded).
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, L, T).

This tests:
- Position 1: **I** (new)
- Position 2: **M** (new)
- Position 4: **G** (new)

Another is ""SLATE"".\n Let me choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.\n\n However, note the example in the game rules started with ""STORM"", but we can pick independently.\n\n We\'ll go with ""CRANE"". It contains C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common letters.\n\n So our first guess is: CRANE\n\n But note: we must output in the specified XML-like format.\n\n Let me format the response accordingly.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)\n This means:\n   - A and E are in the secret word and in the correct positions (since they are marked with ✓).\n   - Specifically, A is the 3rd letter (position 3) and E is the 5th letter (position 5) of the secret word.\n   - C, R, and N are not in the word at all (marked with x).\n\n So the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ E\n\n We know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be a valid English word.\n\n Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:\n   - Has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.\n   - Does not contain C, R, or N (since they are not in the word).\n   - Includes new letters to test for the remaining positions (1, 2, and 4).\n\n We have to avoid using the letters C, R, N.\n\n Let\'s think of common letters that can appear in the remaining positions.\n\n The word pattern: _ _ A _ E\n\n We can try to think of words that fit this pattern.\n\n Some examples: \n   - plate: P L A T E -> but we have to check if P, L, T are allowed?

We can try to use common letters that we haven\'t tested yet.\n\n Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, Z.\n\n We also have vowels: we already have A and E, so the remaining vowel might be I, O, U?

But we don\'t know if there are repeats. However, the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any duplicate, but that doesn\'t mean the secret word doesn\'t have duplicates.\n\n But note: in the first guess, we had no duplicate letters, and the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicate in the secret word? Actually, we don\'t know. The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.\n\n Since we have two positions to test (1,2, and 4) and we have three positions to fill, we can try to use three new letters.\n\n Let me try to pick a word that has common letters that haven\'t been tried.\n\n We can try ""plate"": \n   - P, L, T are new. But note: we are avoiding R, C, N, which we know are absent.\n\n However, we must ensure that the word is valid.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""saute"": \n   - S, U, T -> but U is a vowel and we already have two vowels? But that\'s okay.\n\n But note: the pattern is _ _ A _ E. So ""saute"" would be S A U T E -> wait, that has A in the second position? No, we need A in the third.\n\n Let me clarify the positions:\n\n   Position 1: first blank\n   Position 2: second blank\n   Position 3: A (fixed)\n   Position 4: fourth blank\n   Position 5: E (fixed)\n\n So ""saute"" is S-A-U-T-E -> that would be: \n   Position1: S, Position2: A -> but we need position3 to be A, so that doesn\'t fit.\n\n We must have the third letter as A and the fifth as E.\n\n So the word must be: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E\n\n Now, let\'s think of words that fit:\n\n   - plate: P L A T E -> positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> valid.\n   - slate: S L A T E -> valid.\n   - state: S T A T E -> but T is repeated? That\'s okay, but we don\'t know if T is in the word or not.\n\n However, we want to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use any other letters.\n\n Let me choose ""plate"" because it uses three new common letters: P, L, T.\n\n But note: we have already tested A and E, so we are only testing P, L, T for positions 1,2,4.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more common consonants. Another common starting second guess is ""salet"", but that has S, A, L, E, T -> but note: we have A and E fixed, so we can\'t change them. And ""salet"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be. But let\'s stick to common words.\n\n Another option: ""stale"" -> S T A L E -> but that has E in the fifth? Actually, ""stale"" is S T A L E -> positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). That fits.\n\n But we have two options: ""plate"" and ""stale"". Which one to choose?\n\n We can also consider ""shade"": S H A D E -> S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)\n\n We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is present. Since we don\'t have any information about the first, second, and fourth letters, we should choose a word that has common letters in those positions.\n\n According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters in the first position are S, C, B, T, P, ... but we know C is out. So S, B, T, P.\n\n In the second position: common letters are A, E, I, O, U, H, ... but we already have A and E fixed, so we are looking for consonants? Actually, the second position can be any letter.\n\n However, we are constrained by the words that exist.\n\n Let me choose ""stale"" because it uses S and T which are very common. But note: we have to avoid R, C, N. ""stale"" does not contain these.\n\n But wait: in the first guess, we had R and it was absent. So we can use S and T.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""spade"": S P A D E -> but that has P and D.\n\n I think ""stale"" is a good choice because it has S and T, which are common.\n\n However, note that we have two positions to test: 1, 2, and 4. In ""stale"", we are testing S for position1, T for position2, and L for position4.\n\n But we can also consider ""skate"": S K A T E -> testing S(1), K(2), T(4). That\'s also good.\n\n Since we don\'t have any information, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:\n\n   S, E, A, O, R, I, L, T, ... (but R is out, and we have A and E already)\n\n So we want to test S, T, L, etc.\n\n I think ""stale"" is a good choice.\n\n But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""stale"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""slate"", which is also very common.\n\n Let me go with ""slate"": \n   - S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)\n\n This way, we test S, L, and T.\n\n So our second guess: ""slate""\n\n We\'ll output: <guess>slate</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **A (3rd position)** and **E (5th position)** are correct and in the right spot.\n- **C, R, N** are absent from the word.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E`.  \nFor the next guess, I need to:\n- Keep **A** in the 3rd position and **E** in the 5th position.\n- Avoid using **C, R, N**.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, D, P**) to gather more information.\n\nI chose **""slate""** because:\n- It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` → **S L A T E**.\n- It tests **S** (position 1), **L** (position 2), and **T** (position 4)—all high-frequency letters not yet evaluated.\n- It avoids C, R, N.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n1.

But S is absent, and also the first letter A: we don\'t know if A might appear twice? But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was correct, but it might also be in other positions? However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed A in position 3 as correct, but there could be another A? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicate letters explicitly. But note:\n\nIn ""crane"": we had A as correct in position 3, but if there was another A, and we didn\'t test it in other positions, we wouldn\'t know. Similarly in ""slate"", we had A in position 3 correct, and no other A was tested.\n\nHowever, we cannot rule out the possibility of multiple A\'s. But for now, let\'s focus on words without the absent letters.\n\nPossible words that fit _ _ A _ E and avoid C,R,N,S,L,T:\n\n- ""name"": but only 4 letters? No, we need 5 letters.\n\nLet\'s search for 5-letter words ending with E and A in the third position.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- ""gape"": too short? No, 4 letters.\n\nUsing a word finder or by brainstorming:\n\n- ""bade"": too short? Again, 4 letters? Wait, no, ""bade"" is 4 letters? We need 5-letter words.\n\nWe must have exactly 5 letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""quake"": Q U A K E -> pattern: Q(1) U(2) A(3) K(4) E(5). Now, Q, U, K: none of them are in our absent list? Let\'s check: absent are C,R,N,S,L,T. So Q, U, K are allowed.\n\nBut is ""quake"" valid? Yes.\n\nHowever, we are not sure if these letters are common.\n\nAnother word: ""vague"": V A G U E -> but A is in position 2? No: V(1), A(2), G(3), U(4), E(5). So A is in position 2, not 3. Incorrect pattern.\n\n""jade"": but 4 letters.\n\n""fame"": 4 letters.\n\nMaybe ""aware"": A W A R E -> but A is in position 1? Pattern: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), E(5). But R is absent, so we cannot use R.\n\nWhat about ""image""? I M A G E -> I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5). This fits the pattern. Letters: I, M, G are not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,S,L,T. So I, M, G are fine.\n\nSo ""image"" is I M A G E.\n\nAnother possibility: ""paged"": P A G E D -> but that\'s 5 letters? Pattern: P(1) A(2) G(3) E(4) D(5) -> here A is in position 2, not 3. Doesn\'t fit.\n\n""gauge"": G A U G E -> A in position 2.\n\n""quake"": we had that: Q(1) U(2) A(3) K(4) E(5) -> acceptable.\n\n""drape"": D R A P E -> R is absent, so no.\n\n""maize"": M A I Z E -> but A is in position 2? Pattern: M(1) A(2) I(3) Z(4) E(5) -> A is in position 2, not 3. We need the third letter to be A.\n\nSo we need: [1][2]A[4]E.\n\nOther words: \n- ""dance"": D A N C E -> but N and C are absent, so no.\n- ""fable"": F A B L E -> L absent.\n- ""cable"": C absent.\n\nMaybe ""abate"": A B A T E -> but T is absent (from guess2: T is x) and S,L,T are absent. So T is out.\n\nWhat about ""beige"": B E I G E -> E is in position 2? Pattern: B(1) E(2) I(3) G(4) E(5) -> E in position 2 and 5? We know E is in position 5, but we don\'t have any information about position 2 yet. However, the third letter is I, not A. So doesn\'t fit.\n\nBack to ""image"": I M A G E -> positions: I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5). All letters I, M, G are allowed.\n\nQuake: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> Q, U, K allowed.\n\nBut ""image"" uses more common letters? M, G, I are more common than Q and U.\n\nAnother word: ""badge"": B A D G E -> A in position 2? No.\n\n""value"": V A L U E -> L absent.\n\n""hazel"": H A Z E L -> only 5 letters? Pattern: H(1), A(2), Z(3), E(4), L(5) -> no, because we need E in position 5? Wait, E is in position 4, and we have L in position 5? But the secret word has E in position 5, so position 4 cannot be E? Our pattern is _ _ A _ E, so the fourth letter must be something else and fifth is E.\n\nAnother idea: ""brake"": B R A K E -> R is absent.\n\n""flake"": F L A K E -> L absent.\n\n""jake"": not 5 letters.\n\n""ovate"": O V A T E -> but T is absent.\n\n""newer"": but E in position 5? Pattern: N E W E R -> N is absent? Also, no A in position 3.\n\n""adept"": A D E P T -> doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nPerhaps ""baghe"": not a word.\n\nI think ""image"" and ""quake"" are possible.\n\nAnother word: ""faine"" - not common? Or ""faire"" - not standard.\n\n""maize"": but again, A is in position 2.\n\nWait, we need the third letter to be A, so only words like [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E.\n\nLet me think of more:\n- ""glade"": G L A D E -> L absent? Guess2 said L is x, so no.\n- ""shade"": S H A D E -> S absent? Guess2 said S is x, so no.\n\nWhat about ""above""? A B O V E -> pattern: A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Third letter is O, not A.\n\n""hate"": too short.\n\n""pate"": too short.\n\n""diode"": not matching.\n\nMaybe ""haute"": H A U T E -> T absent.\n\n""gauze"": G A U E? Wait, G A U Z E -> pattern: G(1), A(2), U(3), Z(4), E(5) -> third letter U, not A.\n\n""payee"": P A Y E E -> but E is in position 4? Pattern: P(1), A(2), Y(3), E(4), E(5) -> but we need E in position 5? And third letter is Y. So no.\n\nI\'m struggling. Let\'s try ""mange"": M A N G E -> N is absent? Yes, from guess1, N is x.\n\n""large"": L, R absent.\n\n""barge"": B A R G E -> R absent.\n\n""vague"": V A G U E -> A in position 2.\n\nBut we have ""image"": I M A G E\n\n""quake"": Q U A K E\n\n""ozone"": not matching pattern.\n\nAnother one: ""exile"": E X I L E -> L absent and pattern doesn\'t fit.\n\n""agape"": A G A P E -> but that\'s A in position1 and 3? Pattern: A(1) G(2) A(3) P(4) E(5). So that fits. Now, letters: A, G, P. We know A is already present and in position3, but we didn\'t test A in position1. And we know G and P haven\'t been tested? And A might be duplicated? Also, avoid C,R,N,S,L,T: G and P are not in that set? And A is allowed.\n\nSo ""agape"": A G A P E\n\nBut note: in guess1, we had A in position3 and it was correct, but we didn\'t test A in other positions. So it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""abate"" but T absent.\n\n""agape"" is a valid word meaning a state of wonder.\n\nAnother option: ""afire"": A F I R E -> but R is absent.\n\n""aside"": A S I D E -> S is absent.\n\nSo few options: ""image"", ""quake"", ""agape"".\n\nWe have to pick one.\n\nWe could also have ""bake"": too short? Or ""bakes"" - but S is absent.\n\nLet\'s consider ""jape"" - too short.\n\n""gaffe"": G A F F E -> pattern: G(1) A(2) F(3) F(4) E(5) -> third letter F, not A.\n\nI think ""image"", ""agape"", and ""quake"" are among the few.\n\nWhich one gives us more information?\n\n""image"" uses I, M, G.\n""agape"" uses A, G, P. But note: we already know A is in the word? And we know it is in position 3. But if we use A in position1, we might get:\n- If A is also in the secret word at position1, it would be marked with \'-\' or \'✓\'? Actually, if the secret word has A in position1, we would get ✓ for position1 and ✓ for position3? But we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, ""quake"" uses Q, U, K which are less common, so it might be less informative.\n\nTherefore, I prefer ""image"" or ""agape"".\n\nLet me list the positions:\n\nSecret must be: [1][2]A[4]E\n\nIn ""agape"": \n- position1: A -> if the secret has A at position1, we\'d get ✓ for position1? But we know A is at position3. Could there be two A\'s? Yes.\n- position2: G\n- position4: P\n\nIn ""image"":\n- position1: I\n- position2: M\n- position4: G\n\nSince we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters, both are possible.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s choose ""image"" because it tests three entirely new letters: I, M, G.\n\nWhereas ""agape"" tests G and P, but also A in position1 which we already have in the word (but we don\'t know where else it might be).\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we want to maximize new information.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll choose ""image"".\n\nWe\'ll guess ""image"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: is ""image"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.\n\nSo: <guess>image</guess>\n\nWe must remember the absent letters: C,R,N,S,L,T are not in the word.\n\nBy using ""image"", if we get new \'x\', then we know I, M, G are absent too? Or if we get some marks, we\'ll know more.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **crane**: A (3rd) and E (5th) are correct; C, R, N are absent.\n- **slate**: A (3rd) and E (5th) are correct; S, L, T are absent.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E` (with A in position 3 and E in position 5).  \nAbsent letters to avoid: **C, R, N, S, L, T**.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Keep **A** in position 3 and **E** in position 5.\n- Test new common letters not in the absent set (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P).\n- Prioritize high-frequency letters to maximize information.\n\nI chose **""image""** because:\n- It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` → **I M A G E**.\n- Uses **I**, **M**, and **G** (all new, high-frequency letters not excluded).\n- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, L, T).\n\nThis tests:\n- Position 1: **I** (new)\n- Position 2: **M** (new)\n- Position 4: **G** (new)\n\n<guess>image</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: image -> FEEDBACK: I(x) M(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from three guesses:
1. crane: A(3rd position) and E(5th position) are correct; C, R, N are absent.
2. slate: A(3rd) and E(5th) are correct; S, L, T are absent.
3. image: A(3rd) and E(5th) are correct; I, M, G are absent.

So now, we know:
- Secret word pattern: _ _ A _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G

Thus, the set of disallowed letters is: {C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G}

The available letters are: B, D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a valid English word that fits the pattern: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E, and uses only the available letters.

Let's think of possible words:

- Position 1: We need a consonant or vowel from the available set. Common consonants left: B, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y
- Position 2: Similar, but note that position 3 is A, so position 2 should be such that the word exists.
- Position 4: Must be a letter that can precede E.

Possible words:

- ""abase"": But S is absent? Yes, S is in the disallowed set. So no.
- ""abate"": But T is absent? Yes, T is disallowed. So no.
- ""above"": O is in the available set? Yes, but let's check: A B O V E -> Positions: A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). But we need the third position to be A, but here O is in third? No. Also, pattern requires third to be A, so this doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: [1][2]A[4]E

For example:
- ""quake"": Already considered earlier, but Q U A K E -> U is allowed? Disallowed letters are C,R,N,S,L,T,I,M,G. So Q, U, K are allowed. But we tried ""image"" with similar constraints? No, now we know I, M, G are also absent.

""quake"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> Letters: Q, U, K are in available set? Yes. So if ""quake"" wasn't already tried, we can use it.

Similarly:
- ""vague"": V A G U E -> Pattern: V(1), A(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) -> But A is in position 2, not 3? And G is disallowed? Yes, G is absent (from image: G is x). So no.

""jade"": Not 5 letters.

""fame"": Not 5.

""payee"": P A Y E E -> Pattern: P(1), A(2), Y(3), E(4), E(5) -> Third letter is Y? Not A. So no.

""diode"": Not matching.

Another word: ""paste"": But S and T are absent.

""bake"": Too short.

Perhaps ""pause"": But P A U S E -> S is absent.

Since A is in position 3, we look for words like XXaXe.

After brainstorming:

- ""quake"": As above. Q, U, K available.
- ""awake"": But S? No, A W A K E -> Pattern: A(1), W(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). So that fits. Now, letters: A, W, K. Disallowed: We must check A is already known? But we haven't tested W and K? And A is allowed? However, we already tested A in position 3 and it is present. We haven't tested A in position 1? But in the disallowed set, A is not disallowed. We know A is present? Exactly, and we know it is in position 3, but it might be in other positions? The previous feedback didn't rule out that possibility.

But for feedback, if we guess ""awake"":
- Position 1: A -> could be marked as 'x' if not present, or '-' if present but wrong spot, or '✓' if correct.
- Position 2: W
- Position 3: A -> already known correct? So ✓
- Position 4: K
- Position 5: E -> ✓

Now, letters: A, W, K. W and K are in available set.

But note: we know A is present from the first guess? Yes, but only that it is in position 3? We don't know if there is another A. Similarly, we haven't tested A in position 1.

Moreover, ""awake"" uses two A's? Well, one in position 1 and one in position 3. So we are testing for duplicate A.

But is ""awake"" acceptable? Yes.

Another word: ""abuse"": But S is absent? Yes.

""adage"": A D A G E -> Disallowed: G is absent. So no.

""afire"": F? But R is absent? R is disallowed. So no.

""agape"": We considered but G is absent? Yes, from image: G is x. So no.

""ahead"": A H E A D? Pattern: A H E A D? No. Pattern should be _ _ A _ E? Not matching.

So few options: ""quake"" and ""awake"".

What about ""broke"": But R absent? R is disallowed? Yes.

""brake"": R absent.

Therefore, let's try ""awake"": A W A K E

But note: position 1 is A, which hasn't been tested? We know A is in the word, but only that it is in position 3? So if the secret word does not have A in position 1, we might get A marked as '-'.

Similarly, ""quake"" doesn't use A.

To test, we can pick one.

Another possibility: ""gauze"": But not matching pattern.

Or ""ozone"": not matching.

Perhaps ""evade"": E V A D E -> Pattern: E(1), V(2), A(3), D(4), E(5). This fits? Yes. And letters: E, V, D. Now, E: we know E is present in position 5? But we haven't tested E in position 1? So possible.

Disallowed letters: E is not disallowed? Disallowed are C,R,N,S,L,T,I,M,G. So E, V, D are all allowed.

Moreover, in ""evade"":
- Position 1: E -> new
- Position 2: V -> new
- Position 4: D -> new

This tests three new letters: E, V, D.

Is ""evade"" a valid word? Yes.

Similarly, ""exile"": But L and E in position 1? Pattern: E X I L E -> I and L disallowed? I (from image: I is x) and L disallowed. So skip.

""exile"": I and L absent? Yes.

""evoke"": E V O K E -> Pattern: E(1), V(2), O(3), K(4), E(5). But third position is O, not A? Doesn't fit.

Only ""evade"" and similar.

Another word: ""erase"": But S absent? Yes.

""elate"": L and T absent? Yes.

Therefore, we have three candidates: ""quake"", ""awake"", ""evade"".

Let's compare:
- ""quake"": Q, U, K -> less common letters.
- ""awake"": A, W, K -> uses A again? Which we might know something about.
- ""evade"": E, V, D -> tests E in position 1.

We don't know if E is duplicated? We know E is in position 5, but maybe in other positions? Similarly for A.

So all are possible.

To maximize new letters, avoid testing letters we already know are present? But we are limited. We must test positions 1,2,4.

""evade"" tests E (which we know is in the word) but we don't know about position 1.

Similarly, ""awake"" tests A again.

Whereas ""quake"" uses entirely new letters: Q, U, K.

But since Q and U are rare, it might be less efficient.

We need to pick based on word validity and commonness.

But the absence list is large, so few words might exist.

Another word: ""owing"": Not matching.

""adobe"": A D O B E -> Pattern: A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). Third position O? Not A.

""anode"": N absent? Yes.

""apace"": A P A C E -> Position 1: A, 2: P, 3: A, 4: C. But C is absent? Yes from guess1: C is x. So skip.

""arose"": R, S absent.

Perhaps ""evade"" is the best? Because E, V, D are relatively common.

And ""evade"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""okapi"": Not ending with E? Pattern doesn't fit.

I think we should go with ""evade"".

""evade"" would be: E V A D E

But note: position 4 is D? And position 5 E? But it's E V A D E.

Now, let us write: E(1), V(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)

We know E is in position 5? So if we guess E in position 1, if the secret word does not have E in position 1, we might get feedback as '-' (meaning E is in the word? Because E is already known to be in position 5) or 'x' if E is not duplicated? Wait, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplication explicitly? But the rules: each letter is marked independently.

Specifically:
- If the secret word does not have another E besides position 5, then position 1 E would be marked as 'x'? But wait, not necessarily: if there is another E? But we don't know.

The feedback symbol:
- ✓ if the letter is correct in that position.
- '-' if the letter is in the word but wrong position.
- 'x' if the letter is not in the word.

In ""evade"":
- Position 1: E -> could be marked as:
  - '✓' if the secret has E in position 1? But we know E is in position 5? So if E is also in position 1, we could get ✓.
  - '-' if the secret has another E? Or an E in another position? But we know E is in position 5? So if E is not in position1, but there is an E somewhere else? But currently, we only know about position5 E. So if the secret word has only one E (in position 5), then E in position1 will be marked as 'x'.
  - If it has two E's (one in position5 and another elsewhere), then E in position1 might be '-' if that other position is not position1, etc.

Similarly for ""awake"" with two A's.

Since we are constrained, let's choose ""evade"".

Another word: ""bade"": short? No, we need 5 letters. ""bated"": T absent.

""deane"": not common.

""heave"": H E A V E -> Pattern: H(1) E(2) A(3) V(4) E(5). This fits? Yes. But E(2) and E(5). Letters: H, E, V. Disallowed: E is allowed? Disallowed set has C,R,N,S,L,T,I,M,G? So H, E, V are available.

So ""heave"": H(1) E(2) A(3) V(4) E(5)

Similarly, ""leave"": L absent? Yes.

Therefore, ""heave"" is possible? But note that E is used? We know E is present? We haven't tested E in position2? Similarly.

So words: ""evade"", ""heave"", ""quake"", ""awake"".

Now, ""evade"" uses E in position1, V in2, D in4.

""heave"" uses H in1, E in2, V in4.

We have not tested H, D, V? But we tested E in position5.

Which one? 

""evade"" might be slightly better? Because it tests D? Or we can choose arbitrarily.

I'll choose ""evade"" to test D.

So: <guess>evade</guess>Based on cumulative feedback:
- Secret word pattern: `_ _ A _ E` (A in position 3, E in position 5).
- Absent letters: **C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G** (from previous ""x"" feedbacks).
- Available letters: **B, D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

For the next guess:
- Must retain **A** in position 3 and **E** in position 5.
- Use only available letters.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., **D, V, H, K**) to gather more information.

I selected **""evade""** because:
- It fits `_ _ A _ E` → **E V A D E**.
- Uses new letters **E** (tested in position 1), **V** (position 2), and **D** (position 4).
- Avoids all absent letters.
- ""evade"" is a valid English word.

This tests:
- Position 1: **E** (could reveal if E appears elsewhere)
- Position 2: **V**
- Position 4: **D**

<guess>evade</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from all guesses:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ A _ E` (A in position 3, E in position 5).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess (Guess 4):
- Must keep **A** in position 3 and **E** in position 5.
- Use only available letters to test positions 1, 2, and 4.
- Prioritize common letters like **D**, **V**, or **H** for maximum information.

I chose **""evade""** because:
- It fits the pattern → **E V A D E**.
- Tests **E** in position 1 (could reveal a duplicate E), **V** in position 2, and **D** in position 4—all new, high-frequency letters.
- Avoids absent letters.
- Valid English word (meaning: to escape or avoid).

This guess will clarify:
- If **E** appears elsewhere (feedback on position 1).
- If **V** or **D** are present and positioned correctly.

<guess>evade</guess>",evade,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

Similarly, ""exile"": But L and E in position 1? Pattern: E X I L E -> I and L disallowed? I (from image: I is x) and L disallowed. So skip.

""exile"": I and L absent? Yes.

""evoke"": E V O K E -> Pattern: E(1), V(2), O(3), K(4), E(5). But third position is O, not A? Doesn't fit.

Only ""evade"" and similar.

Another word: ""erase"": But S absent? Yes.

""elate"": L and T absent? Yes.

Therefore, we have three candidates: ""quake"", ""awake"", ""evade"".

Let's compare:
- ""quake"": Q, U, K -> less common letters.
- ""awake"": A, W, K -> uses A again? Which we might know something about.
- ""evade"": E, V, D -> tests E in position 1.

We don't know if E is duplicated? We know E is in position 5, but maybe in other positions? Similarly for A.

So all are possible.

To maximize new letters, avoid testing letters we already know are present? But we are limited. We must test positions 1,2,4.

""evade"" tests E (which we know is in the word) but we don't know about position 1.

Similarly, ""awake"" tests A again.

Whereas ""quake"" uses entirely new letters: Q, U, K.

But since Q and U are rare, it might be less efficient.

We need to pick based on word validity and commonness.

But the absence list is large, so few words might exist.

Another word: ""owing"": Not matching.

""adobe"": A D O B E -> Pattern: A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). Third position O? Not A.

""anode"": N absent? Yes.

""apace"": A P A C E -> Position 1: A, 2: P, 3: A, 4: C. But C is absent? Yes from guess1: C is x. So skip.

""arose"": R, S absent.

Perhaps ""evade"" is the best? Because E, V, D are relatively common.

And ""evade"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""okapi"": Not ending with E? Pattern doesn't fit.

I think we should go with ""evade"".

""evade"" would be: E V A D E

But note: position 4 is D? And position 5 E? But it's E V A D E.

Now, let us write: E(1), V(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)

We know E is in position 5? So if we guess E in position 1, if the secret word does not have E in position 1, we might get feedback as '-' (meaning E is in the word? Because E is already known to be in position 5) or 'x' if E is not duplicated? Wait, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplication explicitly? But the rules: each letter is marked independently.

Specifically:
- If the secret word does not have another E besides position 5, then position 1 E would be marked as 'x'? But wait, not necessarily: if there is another E? But we don't know.

The feedback symbol:
- ✓ if the letter is correct in that position.
- '-' if the letter is in the word but wrong position.
- 'x' if the letter is not in the word.

In ""evade"":
- Position 1: E -> could be marked as:
  - '✓' if the secret has E in position 1? But we know E is in position 5? So if E is also in position 1, we could get ✓.
  - '-' if the secret has another E? Or an E in another position? But we know E is in position 5? So if E is not in position1, but there is an E somewhere else? But currently, we only know about position5 E. So if the secret word has only one E (in position 5), then E in position1 will be marked as 'x'.
  - If it has two E's (one in position5 and another elsewhere), then E in position1 might be '-' if that other position is not position1, etc.

Similarly for ""awake"" with two A's.

Since we are constrained, let's choose ""evade"".

Another word: ""bade"": short? No, we need 5 letters. ""bated"": T absent.

""deane"": not common.

""heave"": H E A V E -> Pattern: H(1) E(2) A(3) V(4) E(5). This fits? Yes. But E(2) and E(5). Letters: H, E, V. Disallowed: E is allowed? Disallowed set has C,R,N,S,L,T,I,M,G? So H, E, V are available.

So ""heave"": H(1) E(2) A(3) V(4) E(5)

Similarly, ""leave"": L absent? Yes.

Therefore, ""heave"" is possible? But note that E is used? We know E is present? We haven't tested E in position2? Similarly.

So words: ""evade"", ""heave"", ""quake"", ""awake"".

Now, ""evade"" uses E in position1, V in2, D in4.

""heave"" uses H in1, E in2, V in4.

We have not tested H, D, V? But we tested E in position5.

Which one? 

""evade"" might be slightly better? Because it tests D? Or we can choose arbitrarily.

I'll choose ""evade"" to test D.

So: <guess>evade</guess>Based on cumulative feedback:
- Secret word pattern: `_ _ A _ E` (A in position 3, E in position 5).
- Absent letters: **C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G** (from previous ""x"" feedbacks).
- Available letters: **B, D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

For the next guess:
- Must retain **A** in position 3 and **E** in position 5.
- Use only available letters.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., **D, V, H, K**) to gather more information.

I selected **""evade""** because:
- It fits `_ _ A _ E` → **E V A D E**.
- Uses new letters **E** (tested in position 1), **V** (position 2), and **D** (position 4).
- Avoids all absent letters.
- ""evade"" is a valid English word.

This tests:
- Position 1: **E** (could reveal if E appears elsewhere)
- Position 2: **V**
- Position 4: **D**

<guess>evade</guess>Based on the feedback from all guesses:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ A _ E` (A in position 3, E in position 5).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess (Guess 4):
- Must keep **A** in position 3 and **E** in position 5.
- Use only available letters to test positions 1, 2, and 4.
- Prioritize common letters like **D**, **V**, or **H** for maximum information.

I chose **""evade""** because:
- It fits the pattern → **E V A D E**.
- Tests **E** in position 1 (could reveal a duplicate E), **V** in position 2, and **D** in position 4—all new, high-frequency letters.
- Avoids absent letters.
- Valid English word (meaning: to escape or avoid).

This guess will clarify:
- If **E** appears elsewhere (feedback on position 1).
- If **V** or **D** are present and positioned correctly.",Guess 4: evade -> FEEDBACK: E(-) V(x) A(✓) D(x) E(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no information yet, so we want a starting word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word in Wordle often uses common letters and avoids repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 The most common letters in English 5-letter words are: E, A, R, O, T, L, I, S, N, C, etc.

 One popular starting word is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters and no repeats. Another is ""SLATE"".
 Let me choose ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 However, note the example in the game rules started with ""STORM"", but we can pick independently.

 We'll go with ""CRANE"". It contains C, R, A, N, E – all fairly common letters.

 So our first guess is: CRANE

 But note: we must output in the specified XML-like format.

 Let me format the response accordingly.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(✓), N(x), E(✓)
 This means:
   - A and E are in the secret word and in the correct positions (since they are marked with ✓).
   - Specifically, A is the 3rd letter (position 3) and E is the 5th letter (position 5) of the secret word.
   - C, R, and N are not in the word at all (marked with x).

 So the secret word has the form: _ _ A _ E

 We know that the word has exactly 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
   - Has A in the 3rd position and E in the 5th position.
   - Does not contain C, R, or N (since they are not in the word).
   - Includes new letters to test for the remaining positions (1, 2, and 4).

 We have to avoid using the letters C, R, N.

 Let's think of common letters that can appear in the remaining positions.

 The word pattern: _ _ A _ E

 We can try to think of words that fit this pattern.

 Some examples: 
   - plate: P L A T E -> but we have to check if P, L, T are allowed? We haven't seen them yet.
   - slate: S L A T E -> but S is new, L is new, T is new. However, note that in the first guess we didn't have S, L, T.

 But wait: we must avoid R, C, N. So plate and slate are okay in terms of avoiding those.

 However, we also want to maximize information. We can try to use common letters that we haven't tested yet.

 Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, S, T, V, W, Y, Z.

 We also have vowels: we already have A and E, so the remaining vowel might be I, O, U? But we don't know.

 Let's list some words that fit _ _ A _ E:

   - blade: B L A D E -> but D is new, and we have B and L to test.
   - flame: F L A M E -> F, L, M
   - shade: S H A D E -> S, H, D
   - stake: S T A K E -> S, T, K

 We have to choose one that uses as many new common letters as possible.

 Since we have two positions (1 and 2) and one position (4) to figure out, we can try to cover multiple common letters.

 Another idea: use a word that has repeated letters? But we don't know if there are repeats. However, the feedback for the first guess didn't show any duplicate, but that doesn't mean the secret word doesn't have duplicates.

 But note: in the first guess, we had no duplicate letters, and the feedback didn't indicate any duplicate in the secret word? Actually, we don't know. The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.

 Since we have two positions to test (1,2, and 4) and we have three positions to fill, we can try to use three new letters.

 Let me try to pick a word that has common letters that haven't been tried.

 We can try ""plate"": 
   - P, L, T are new. But note: we are avoiding R, C, N, which we know are absent.

 However, we must ensure that the word is valid.

 Alternatively, we can try ""saute"": 
   - S, U, T -> but U is a vowel and we already have two vowels? But that's okay.

 But note: the pattern is _ _ A _ E. So ""saute"" would be S A U T E -> wait, that has A in the second position? No, we need A in the third.

 Let me clarify the positions:

   Position 1: first blank
   Position 2: second blank
   Position 3: A (fixed)
   Position 4: fourth blank
   Position 5: E (fixed)

 So ""saute"" is S-A-U-T-E -> that would be: 
   Position1: S, Position2: A -> but we need position3 to be A, so that doesn't fit.

 We must have the third letter as A and the fifth as E.

 So the word must be: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E

 Now, let's think of words that fit:

   - plate: P L A T E -> positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> valid.
   - slate: S L A T E -> valid.
   - state: S T A T E -> but T is repeated? That's okay, but we don't know if T is in the word or not.

 However, we want to avoid using letters we know are absent. We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use any other letters.

 Let me choose ""plate"" because it uses three new common letters: P, L, T.

 But note: we have already tested A and E, so we are only testing P, L, T for positions 1,2,4.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses more common consonants. Another common starting second guess is ""salet"", but that has S, A, L, E, T -> but note: we have A and E fixed, so we can't change them. And ""salet"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be. But let's stick to common words.

 Another option: ""stale"" -> S T A L E -> but that has E in the fifth? Actually, ""stale"" is S T A L E -> positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). That fits.

 But we have two options: ""plate"" and ""stale"". Which one to choose?

 We can also consider ""shade"": S H A D E -> S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)

 We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is present. Since we don't have any information about the first, second, and fourth letters, we should choose a word that has common letters in those positions.

 According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters in the first position are S, C, B, T, P, ... but we know C is out. So S, B, T, P.

 In the second position: common letters are A, E, I, O, U, H, ... but we already have A and E fixed, so we are looking for consonants? Actually, the second position can be any letter.

 However, we are constrained by the words that exist.

 Let me choose ""stale"" because it uses S and T which are very common. But note: we have to avoid R, C, N. ""stale"" does not contain these.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had R and it was absent. So we can use S and T.

 Alternatively, we can choose ""spade"": S P A D E -> but that has P and D.

 I think ""stale"" is a good choice because it has S and T, which are common.

 However, note that we have two positions to test: 1, 2, and 4. In ""stale"", we are testing S for position1, T for position2, and L for position4.

 But we can also consider ""skate"": S K A T E -> testing S(1), K(2), T(4). That's also good.

 Since we don't have any information, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:

   S, E, A, O, R, I, L, T, ... (but R is out, and we have A and E already)

 So we want to test S, T, L, etc.

 I think ""stale"" is a good choice.

 But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""stale"" is a valid word.

 Alternatively, we can use ""slate"", which is also very common.

 Let me go with ""slate"": 
   - S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)

 This way, we test S, L, and T.

 So our second guess: ""slate""

 We'll output: <guess>slate</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **A (3rd position)** and **E (5th position)** are correct and in the right spot.
- **C, R, N** are absent from the word.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E`.  
For the next guess, I need to:
- Keep **A** in the 3rd position and **E** in the 5th position.
- Avoid using **C, R, N**.
- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, D, P**) to gather more information.

I chose **""slate""** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` → **S L A T E**.
- It tests **S** (position 1), **L** (position 2), and **T** (position 4)—all high-frequency letters not yet evaluated.
- It avoids C, R, N.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:
1. Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
   - This tells us that A is in position 3 and E is in position 5, and C, R, N are absent.
   - Secret word pattern: _ _ A _ E

2. Guess 2: slate -> S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
   - S, L, T are absent from the secret word (since all are marked 'x').

So now we know the following:
- The secret word is of the form: _ _ A _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L, T

We need to avoid using these absent letters in our next guess.

Additionally, we know that the word must contain A and E (with A in position 3 and E in position 5), but we don't know about the other letters.

We have to guess letters that are not in the set {C, R, N, S, L, T}.

Let's list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, R, N, S, L, T.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid English word that fits the pattern _ _ A _ E and only uses letters from the available set.

We have positions 1, 2, and 4 to fill.

Possible words:

- Let's try to think of words that end with 'E' and have 'A' in the third position.

Some ideas:
- blade: but B, L, D -> L is absent (from guess2, L is marked x), so we cannot use L.
- flame: F, L, M -> L is absent, so no.
- shake: S, H, K -> S is absent, so no.

We must avoid S, L, T, C, R, N.

What about ""gaffe""? But ""gaffe"" is G A F F E -> but then A is in position 2, not 3. We need A in position 3.

Pattern must be [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E.

Let's think of words:
- ""grave"": G R A V E -> but R is absent (from guess1) and V is new. However, R is not allowed because it was absent in guess1. So skip.
- ""pause"": P A U S E -> but S is absent and also A is in position 2? No, here: P(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> no, because we need position 3 to be A, not U.
- ""maple"": M A P L E -> again, A in position 2, and L is absent.

We need to find words where the third letter is A and the fifth is E.

Another idea: ""abase"": A B A S E -> pattern: A(1) B(2) A(3) S(4) E(5). But S is absent, and also the first letter A: we don't know if A might appear twice? But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was correct, but it might also be in other positions? However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed A in position 3 as correct, but there could be another A? Actually, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicate letters explicitly. But note:

In ""crane"": we had A as correct in position 3, but if there was another A, and we didn't test it in other positions, we wouldn't know. Similarly in ""slate"", we had A in position 3 correct, and no other A was tested.

However, we cannot rule out the possibility of multiple A's. But for now, let's focus on words without the absent letters.

Possible words that fit _ _ A _ E and avoid C,R,N,S,L,T:

- ""name"": but only 4 letters? No, we need 5 letters.

Let's search for 5-letter words ending with E and A in the third position.

Some possibilities:
- ""gape"": too short? No, 4 letters.

Using a word finder or by brainstorming:

- ""bade"": too short? Again, 4 letters? Wait, no, ""bade"" is 4 letters? We need 5-letter words.

We must have exactly 5 letters.

Another idea: ""quake"": Q U A K E -> pattern: Q(1) U(2) A(3) K(4) E(5). Now, Q, U, K: none of them are in our absent list? Let's check: absent are C,R,N,S,L,T. So Q, U, K are allowed.

But is ""quake"" valid? Yes.

However, we are not sure if these letters are common.

Another word: ""vague"": V A G U E -> but A is in position 2? No: V(1), A(2), G(3), U(4), E(5). So A is in position 2, not 3. Incorrect pattern.

""jade"": but 4 letters.

""fame"": 4 letters.

Maybe ""aware"": A W A R E -> but A is in position 1? Pattern: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), E(5). But R is absent, so we cannot use R.

What about ""image""? I M A G E -> I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5). This fits the pattern. Letters: I, M, G are not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,S,L,T. So I, M, G are fine.

So ""image"" is I M A G E.

Another possibility: ""paged"": P A G E D -> but that's 5 letters? Pattern: P(1) A(2) G(3) E(4) D(5) -> here A is in position 2, not 3. Doesn't fit.

""gauge"": G A U G E -> A in position 2.

""quake"": we had that: Q(1) U(2) A(3) K(4) E(5) -> acceptable.

""drape"": D R A P E -> R is absent, so no.

""maize"": M A I Z E -> but A is in position 2? Pattern: M(1) A(2) I(3) Z(4) E(5) -> A is in position 2, not 3. We need the third letter to be A.

So we need: [1][2]A[4]E.

Other words: 
- ""dance"": D A N C E -> but N and C are absent, so no.
- ""fable"": F A B L E -> L absent.
- ""cable"": C absent.

Maybe ""abate"": A B A T E -> but T is absent (from guess2: T is x) and S,L,T are absent. So T is out.

What about ""beige"": B E I G E -> E is in position 2? Pattern: B(1) E(2) I(3) G(4) E(5) -> E in position 2 and 5? We know E is in position 5, but we don't have any information about position 2 yet. However, the third letter is I, not A. So doesn't fit.

Back to ""image"": I M A G E -> positions: I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5). All letters I, M, G are allowed.

Quake: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> Q, U, K allowed.

But ""image"" uses more common letters? M, G, I are more common than Q and U.

Another word: ""badge"": B A D G E -> A in position 2? No.

""value"": V A L U E -> L absent.

""hazel"": H A Z E L -> only 5 letters? Pattern: H(1), A(2), Z(3), E(4), L(5) -> no, because we need E in position 5? Wait, E is in position 4, and we have L in position 5? But the secret word has E in position 5, so position 4 cannot be E? Our pattern is _ _ A _ E, so the fourth letter must be something else and fifth is E.

Another idea: ""brake"": B R A K E -> R is absent.

""flake"": F L A K E -> L absent.

""jake"": not 5 letters.

""ovate"": O V A T E -> but T is absent.

""newer"": but E in position 5? Pattern: N E W E R -> N is absent? Also, no A in position 3.

""adept"": A D E P T -> doesn't fit pattern.

Perhaps ""baghe"": not a word.

I think ""image"" and ""quake"" are possible.

Another word: ""faine"" - not common? Or ""faire"" - not standard.

""maize"": but again, A is in position 2.

Wait, we need the third letter to be A, so only words like [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E.

Let me think of more:
- ""glade"": G L A D E -> L absent? Guess2 said L is x, so no.
- ""shade"": S H A D E -> S absent? Guess2 said S is x, so no.

What about ""above""? A B O V E -> pattern: A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Third letter is O, not A.

""hate"": too short.

""pate"": too short.

""diode"": not matching.

Maybe ""haute"": H A U T E -> T absent.

""gauze"": G A U E? Wait, G A U Z E -> pattern: G(1), A(2), U(3), Z(4), E(5) -> third letter U, not A.

""payee"": P A Y E E -> but E is in position 4? Pattern: P(1), A(2), Y(3), E(4), E(5) -> but we need E in position 5? And third letter is Y. So no.

I'm struggling. Let's try ""mange"": M A N G E -> N is absent? Yes, from guess1, N is x.

""large"": L, R absent.

""barge"": B A R G E -> R absent.

""vague"": V A G U E -> A in position 2.

But we have ""image"": I M A G E

""quake"": Q U A K E

""ozone"": not matching pattern.

Another one: ""exile"": E X I L E -> L absent and pattern doesn't fit.

""agape"": A G A P E -> but that's A in position1 and 3? Pattern: A(1) G(2) A(3) P(4) E(5). So that fits. Now, letters: A, G, P. We know A is already present and in position3, but we didn't test A in position1. And we know G and P haven't been tested? And A might be duplicated? Also, avoid C,R,N,S,L,T: G and P are not in that set? And A is allowed.

So ""agape"": A G A P E

But note: in guess1, we had A in position3 and it was correct, but we didn't test A in other positions. So it's possible.

Similarly, ""abate"" but T absent.

""agape"" is a valid word meaning a state of wonder.

Another option: ""afire"": A F I R E -> but R is absent.

""aside"": A S I D E -> S is absent.

So few options: ""image"", ""quake"", ""agape"".

We have to pick one.

We could also have ""bake"": too short? Or ""bakes"" - but S is absent.

Let's consider ""jape"" - too short.

""gaffe"": G A F F E -> pattern: G(1) A(2) F(3) F(4) E(5) -> third letter F, not A.

I think ""image"", ""agape"", and ""quake"" are among the few.

Which one gives us more information?

""image"" uses I, M, G.
""agape"" uses A, G, P. But note: we already know A is in the word? And we know it is in position 3. But if we use A in position1, we might get:
- If A is also in the secret word at position1, it would be marked with '-' or '✓'? Actually, if the secret word has A in position1, we would get ✓ for position1 and ✓ for position3? But we don't know.

Similarly, ""quake"" uses Q, U, K which are less common, so it might be less informative.

Therefore, I prefer ""image"" or ""agape"".

Let me list the positions:

Secret must be: [1][2]A[4]E

In ""agape"": 
- position1: A -> if the secret has A at position1, we'd get ✓ for position1? But we know A is at position3. Could there be two A's? Yes.
- position2: G
- position4: P

In ""image"":
- position1: I
- position2: M
- position4: G

Since we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters, both are possible.

But to be safe, let's choose ""image"" because it tests three entirely new letters: I, M, G.

Whereas ""agape"" tests G and P, but also A in position1 which we already have in the word (but we don't know where else it might be).

Since we have limited guesses, we want to maximize new information.

Therefore, I'll choose ""image"".

We'll guess ""image"".

But let's confirm: is ""image"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

So: <guess>image</guess>

We must remember the absent letters: C,R,N,S,L,T are not in the word.

By using ""image"", if we get new 'x', then we know I, M, G are absent too? Or if we get some marks, we'll know more.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- **crane**: A (3rd) and E (5th) are correct; C, R, N are absent.
- **slate**: A (3rd) and E (5th) are correct; S, L, T are absent.

The secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E` (with A in position 3 and E in position 5).  
Absent letters to avoid: **C, R, N, S, L, T**.

For the next guess:
- Keep **A** in position 3 and **E** in position 5.
- Test new common letters not in the absent set (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P).
- Prioritize high-frequency letters to maximize information.

I chose **""image""** because:
- It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` → **I M A G E**.
- Uses **I**, **M**, and **G** (all new, high-frequency letters not excluded).
- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, L, T).

This tests:
- Position 1: **I** (new)
- Position 2: **M** (new)
- Position 4: **G** (new)

<guess>image</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: image -> FEEDBACK: I(x) M(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from three guesses:
1. crane: A(3rd position) and E(5th position) are correct; C, R, N are absent.
2. slate: A(3rd) and E(5th) are correct; S, L, T are absent.
3. image: A(3rd) and E(5th) are correct; I, M, G are absent.

So now, we know:
- Secret word pattern: _ _ A _ E
- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G

Thus, the set of disallowed letters is: {C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G}

The available letters are: B, D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a valid English word that fits the pattern: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E, and uses only the available letters.

Let's think of possible words:

- Position 1: We need a consonant or vowel from the available set. Common consonants left: B, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y
- Position 2: Similar, but note that position 3 is A, so position 2 should be such that the word exists.
- Position 4: Must be a letter that can precede E.

Possible words:

- ""abase"": But S is absent? Yes, S is in the disallowed set. So no.
- ""abate"": But T is absent? Yes, T is disallowed. So no.
- ""above"": O is in the available set? Yes, but let's check: A B O V E -> Positions: A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). But we need the third position to be A, but here O is in third? No. Also, pattern requires third to be A, so this doesn't fit.

We need the pattern: [1][2]A[4]E

For example:
- ""quake"": Already considered earlier, but Q U A K E -> U is allowed? Disallowed letters are C,R,N,S,L,T,I,M,G. So Q, U, K are allowed. But we tried ""image"" with similar constraints? No, now we know I, M, G are also absent.

""quake"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> Letters: Q, U, K are in available set? Yes. So if ""quake"" wasn't already tried, we can use it.

Similarly:
- ""vague"": V A G U E -> Pattern: V(1), A(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) -> But A is in position 2, not 3? And G is disallowed? Yes, G is absent (from image: G is x). So no.

""jade"": Not 5 letters.

""fame"": Not 5.

""payee"": P A Y E E -> Pattern: P(1), A(2), Y(3), E(4), E(5) -> Third letter is Y? Not A. So no.

""diode"": Not matching.

Another word: ""paste"": But S and T are absent.

""bake"": Too short.

Perhaps ""pause"": But P A U S E -> S is absent.

Since A is in position 3, we look for words like XXaXe.

After brainstorming:

- ""quake"": As above. Q, U, K available.
- ""awake"": But S? No, A W A K E -> Pattern: A(1), W(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). So that fits. Now, letters: A, W, K. Disallowed: We must check A is already known? But we haven't tested W and K? And A is allowed? However, we already tested A in position 3 and it is present. We haven't tested A in position 1? But in the disallowed set, A is not disallowed. We know A is present? Exactly, and we know it is in position 3, but it might be in other positions? The previous feedback didn't rule out that possibility.

But for feedback, if we guess ""awake"":
- Position 1: A -> could be marked as 'x' if not present, or '-' if present but wrong spot, or '✓' if correct.
- Position 2: W
- Position 3: A -> already known correct? So ✓
- Position 4: K
- Position 5: E -> ✓

Now, letters: A, W, K. W and K are in available set.

But note: we know A is present from the first guess? Yes, but only that it is in position 3? We don't know if there is another A. Similarly, we haven't tested A in position 1.

Moreover, ""awake"" uses two A's? Well, one in position 1 and one in position 3. So we are testing for duplicate A.

But is ""awake"" acceptable? Yes.

Another word: ""abuse"": But S is absent? Yes.

""adage"": A D A G E -> Disallowed: G is absent. So no.

""afire"": F? But R is absent? R is disallowed. So no.

""agape"": We considered but G is absent? Yes, from image: G is x. So no.

""ahead"": A H E A D? Pattern: A H E A D? No. Pattern should be _ _ A _ E? Not matching.

So few options: ""quake"" and ""awake"".

What about ""broke"": But R absent? R is disallowed? Yes.

""brake"": R absent.

Therefore, let's try ""awake"": A W A K E

But note: position 1 is A, which hasn't been tested? We know A is in the word, but only that it is in position 3? So if the secret word does not have A in position 1, we might get A marked as '-'.

Similarly, ""quake"" doesn't use A.

To test, we can pick one.

Another possibility: ""gauze"": But not matching pattern.

Or ""ozone"": not matching.

Perhaps ""evade"": E V A D E -> Pattern: E(1), V(2), A(3), D(4), E(5). This fits? Yes. And letters: E, V, D. Now, E: we know E is present in position 5? But we haven't tested E in position 1? So possible.

Disallowed letters: E is not disallowed? Disallowed are C,R,N,S,L,T,I,M,G. So E, V, D are all allowed.

Moreover, in ""evade"":
- Position 1: E -> new
- Position 2: V -> new
- Position 4: D -> new

This tests three new letters: E, V, D.

Is ""evade"" a valid word? Yes.

Similarly, ""exile"": But L and E in position 1? Pattern: E X I L E -> I and L disallowed? I (from image: I is x) and L disallowed. So skip.

""exile"": I and L absent? Yes.

""evoke"": E V O K E -> Pattern: E(1), V(2), O(3), K(4), E(5). But third position is O, not A? Doesn't fit.

Only ""evade"" and similar.

Another word: ""erase"": But S absent? Yes.

""elate"": L and T absent? Yes.

Therefore, we have three candidates: ""quake"", ""awake"", ""evade"".

Let's compare:
- ""quake"": Q, U, K -> less common letters.
- ""awake"": A, W, K -> uses A again? Which we might know something about.
- ""evade"": E, V, D -> tests E in position 1.

We don't know if E is duplicated? We know E is in position 5, but maybe in other positions? Similarly for A.

So all are possible.

To maximize new letters, avoid testing letters we already know are present? But we are limited. We must test positions 1,2,4.

""evade"" tests E (which we know is in the word) but we don't know about position 1.

Similarly, ""awake"" tests A again.

Whereas ""quake"" uses entirely new letters: Q, U, K.

But since Q and U are rare, it might be less efficient.

We need to pick based on word validity and commonness.

But the absence list is large, so few words might exist.

Another word: ""owing"": Not matching.

""adobe"": A D O B E -> Pattern: A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). Third position O? Not A.

""anode"": N absent? Yes.

""apace"": A P A C E -> Position 1: A, 2: P, 3: A, 4: C. But C is absent? Yes from guess1: C is x. So skip.

""arose"": R, S absent.

Perhaps ""evade"" is the best? Because E, V, D are relatively common.

And ""evade"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""okapi"": Not ending with E? Pattern doesn't fit.

I think we should go with ""evade"".

""evade"" would be: E V A D E

But note: position 4 is D? And position 5 E? But it's E V A D E.

Now, let us write: E(1), V(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)

We know E is in position 5? So if we guess E in position 1, if the secret word does not have E in position 1, we might get feedback as '-' (meaning E is in the word? Because E is already known to be in position 5) or 'x' if E is not duplicated? Wait, the feedback doesn't tell us about duplication explicitly? But the rules: each letter is marked independently.

Specifically:
- If the secret word does not have another E besides position 5, then position 1 E would be marked as 'x'? But wait, not necessarily: if there is another E? But we don't know.

The feedback symbol:
- ✓ if the letter is correct in that position.
- '-' if the letter is in the word but wrong position.
- 'x' if the letter is not in the word.

In ""evade"":
- Position 1: E -> could be marked as:
  - '✓' if the secret has E in position 1? But we know E is in position 5? So if E is also in position 1, we could get ✓.
  - '-' if the secret has another E? Or an E in another position? But we know E is in position 5? So if E is not in position1, but there is an E somewhere else? But currently, we only know about position5 E. So if the secret word has only one E (in position 5), then E in position1 will be marked as 'x'.
  - If it has two E's (one in position5 and another elsewhere), then E in position1 might be '-' if that other position is not position1, etc.

Similarly for ""awake"" with two A's.

Since we are constrained, let's choose ""evade"".

Another word: ""bade"": short? No, we need 5 letters. ""bated"": T absent.

""deane"": not common.

""heave"": H E A V E -> Pattern: H(1) E(2) A(3) V(4) E(5). This fits? Yes. But E(2) and E(5). Letters: H, E, V. Disallowed: E is allowed? Disallowed set has C,R,N,S,L,T,I,M,G? So H, E, V are available.

So ""heave"": H(1) E(2) A(3) V(4) E(5)

Similarly, ""leave"": L absent? Yes.

Therefore, ""heave"" is possible? But note that E is used? We know E is present? We haven't tested E in position2? Similarly.

So words: ""evade"", ""heave"", ""quake"", ""awake"".

Now, ""evade"" uses E in position1, V in2, D in4.

""heave"" uses H in1, E in2, V in4.

We have not tested H, D, V? But we tested E in position5.

Which one? 

""evade"" might be slightly better? Because it tests D? Or we can choose arbitrarily.

I'll choose ""evade"" to test D.

So: <guess>evade</guess>Based on cumulative feedback:
- Secret word pattern: `_ _ A _ E` (A in position 3, E in position 5).
- Absent letters: **C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G** (from previous ""x"" feedbacks).
- Available letters: **B, D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.

For the next guess:
- Must retain **A** in position 3 and **E** in position 5.
- Use only available letters.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., **D, V, H, K**) to gather more information.

I selected **""evade""** because:
- It fits `_ _ A _ E` → **E V A D E**.
- Uses new letters **E** (tested in position 1), **V** (position 2), and **D** (position 4).
- Avoids all absent letters.
- ""evade"" is a valid English word.

This tests:
- Position 1: **E** (could reveal if E appears elsewhere)
- Position 2: **V**
- Position 4: **D**

<guess>evade</guess>Based on the feedback from all guesses:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ A _ E` (A in position 3, E in position 5).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G (all marked ""x"" in previous guesses).
- **Available letters**: B, D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

For the new guess (Guess 4):
- Must keep **A** in position 3 and **E** in position 5.
- Use only available letters to test positions 1, 2, and 4.
- Prioritize common letters like **D**, **V**, or **H** for maximum information.

I chose **""evade""** because:
- It fits the pattern → **E V A D E**.
- Tests **E** in position 1 (could reveal a duplicate E), **V** in position 2, and **D** in position 4—all new, high-frequency letters.
- Avoids absent letters.
- Valid English word (meaning: to escape or avoid).

This guess will clarify:
- If **E** appears elsewhere (feedback on position 1).
- If **V** or **D** are present and positioned correctly.

But we don\'t know if there are repeats. However, the feedback for the first guess didn\'t show any duplicate, but that doesn\'t mean the secret word doesn\'t have duplicates.\n\n But note: in the first guess, we had no duplicate letters, and the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicate in the secret word? Actually, we don\'t know. The feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed.\n\n Since we have two positions to test (1,2, and 4) and we have three positions to fill, we can try to use three new letters.\n\n Let me try to pick a word that has common letters that haven\'t been tried.\n\n We can try ""plate"": \n   - P, L, T are new.

But that\'s okay.\n\n But note: the pattern is _ _ A _ E. So ""saute"" would be S A U T E -> wait, that has A in the second position? No, we need A in the third.\n\n Let me clarify the positions:\n\n   Position 1: first blank\n   Position 2: second blank\n   Position 3: A (fixed)\n   Position 4: fourth blank\n   Position 5: E (fixed)\n\n So ""saute"" is S-A-U-T-E -> that would be: \n   Position1: S, Position2: A -> but we need position3 to be A, so that doesn\'t fit.\n\n We must have the third letter as A and the fifth as E.\n\n So the word must be: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E\n\n Now, let\'s think of words that fit:\n\n   - plate: P L A T E -> positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5) -> valid.\n   - slate: S L A T E -> valid.\n   - state: S T A T E -> but T is repeated?

Another common starting second guess is ""salet"", but that has S, A, L, E, T -> but note: we have A and E fixed, so we can\'t change them. And ""salet"" is not a common word? Actually, it might be. But let\'s stick to common words.\n\n Another option: ""stale"" -> S T A L E -> but that has E in the fifth? Actually, ""stale"" is S T A L E -> positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). That fits.\n\n But we have two options: ""plate"" and ""stale"". Which one to choose?\n\n We can also consider ""shade"": S H A D E -> S(1), H(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)\n\n We want to maximize the chance of hitting a letter that is present. Since we don\'t have any information about the first, second, and fourth letters, we should choose a word that has common letters in those positions.\n\n According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters in the first position are S, C, B, T, P, ... but we know C is out. So S, B, T, P.\n\n In the second position: common letters are A, E, I, O, U, H, ... but we already have A and E fixed, so we are looking for consonants? Actually, the second position can be any letter.\n\n However, we are constrained by the words that exist.\n\n Let me choose ""stale"" because it uses S and T which are very common. But note: we have to avoid R, C, N. ""stale"" does not contain these.\n\n But wait: in the first guess, we had R and it was absent. So we can use S and T.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose ""spade"": S P A D E -> but that has P and D.\n\n I think ""stale"" is a good choice because it has S and T, which are common.\n\n However, note that we have two positions to test: 1, 2, and 4. In ""stale"", we are testing S for position1, T for position2, and L for position4.\n\n But we can also consider ""skate"": S K A T E -> testing S(1), K(2), T(4). That\'s also good.\n\n Since we don\'t have any information, we want to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\n Let me check the frequency of letters in 5-letter words:\n\n   S, E, A, O, R, I, L, T, ... (but R is out, and we have A and E already)\n\n So we want to test S, T, L, etc.\n\n I think ""stale"" is a good choice.\n\n But note: we have to make sure that the word is valid. ""stale"" is a valid word.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""slate"", which is also very common.\n\n Let me go with ""slate"": \n   - S(1), L(2), A(3), T(4), E(5)\n\n This way, we test S, L, and T.\n\n So our second guess: ""slate""\n\n We\'ll output: <guess>slate</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **A (3rd position)** and **E (5th position)** are correct and in the right spot.\n- **C, R, N** are absent from the word.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E`.  \nFor the next guess, I need to:\n- Keep **A** in the 3rd position and **E** in the 5th position.\n- Avoid using **C, R, N**.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., **S, T, L, D, P**) to gather more information.\n\nI chose **""slate""** because:\n- It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` → **S L A T E**.\n- It tests **S** (position 1), **L** (position 2), and **T** (position 4)—all high-frequency letters not yet evaluated.\n- It avoids C, R, N.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n1.

Guess 2: slate -> S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\n   - S, L, T are absent from the secret word (since all are marked \'x\').\n\nSo now we know the following:\n- The secret word is of the form: _ _ A _ E\n- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L, T\n\nWe need to avoid using these absent letters in our next guess.\n\nAdditionally, we know that the word must contain A and E (with A in position 3 and E in position 5), but we don\'t know about the other letters.\n\nWe have to guess letters that are not in the set {C, R, N, S, L, T}.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, R, N, S, L, T.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a valid English word that fits the pattern _ _ A _ E and only uses letters from the available set.\n\nWe have positions 1, 2, and 4 to fill.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- Let\'s try to think of words that end with \'E\' and have \'A\' in the third position.\n\nSome ideas:\n- blade: but B, L, D -> L is absent (from guess2, L is marked x), so we cannot use L.\n- flame: F, L, M -> L is absent, so no.\n- shake: S, H, K -> S is absent, so no.\n\nWe must avoid S, L, T, C, R, N.\n\nWhat about ""gaffe""? But ""gaffe"" is G A F F E -> but then A is in position 2, not 3. We need A in position 3.\n\nPattern must be [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E.\n\nLet\'s think of words:\n- ""grave"": G R A V E -> but R is absent (from guess1) and V is new. However, R is not allowed because it was absent in guess1. So skip.\n- ""pause"": P A U S E -> but S is absent and also A is in position 2? No, here: P(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> no, because we need position 3 to be A, not U.\n- ""maple"": M A P L E -> again, A in position 2, and L is absent.\n\nWe need to find words where the third letter is A and the fifth is E.\n\nAnother idea: ""abase"": A B A S E -> pattern: A(1) B(2) A(3) S(4) E(5). But S is absent, and also the first letter A: we don\'t know if A might appear twice? But in the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was correct, but it might also be in other positions? However, the feedback for ""crane"" only showed A in position 3 as correct, but there could be another A? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicate letters explicitly. But note:\n\nIn ""crane"": we had A as correct in position 3, but if there was another A, and we didn\'t test it in other positions, we wouldn\'t know. Similarly in ""slate"", we had A in position 3 correct, and no other A was tested.\n\nHowever, we cannot rule out the possibility of multiple A\'s. But for now, let\'s focus on words without the absent letters.\n\nPossible words that fit _ _ A _ E and avoid C,R,N,S,L,T:\n\n- ""name"": but only 4 letters? No, we need 5 letters.\n\nLet\'s search for 5-letter words ending with E and A in the third position.\n\nSome possibilities:\n- ""gape"": too short? No, 4 letters.\n\nUsing a word finder or by brainstorming:\n\n- ""bade"": too short? Again, 4 letters? Wait, no, ""bade"" is 4 letters? We need 5-letter words.\n\nWe must have exactly 5 letters.\n\nAnother idea: ""quake"": Q U A K E -> pattern: Q(1) U(2) A(3) K(4) E(5). Now, Q, U, K: none of them are in our absent list? Let\'s check: absent are C,R,N,S,L,T. So Q, U, K are allowed.\n\nBut is ""quake"" valid? Yes.\n\nHowever, we are not sure if these letters are common.\n\nAnother word: ""vague"": V A G U E -> but A is in position 2? No: V(1), A(2), G(3), U(4), E(5). So A is in position 2, not 3. Incorrect pattern.\n\n""jade"": but 4 letters.\n\n""fame"": 4 letters.\n\nMaybe ""aware"": A W A R E -> but A is in position 1? Pattern: A(1), W(2), A(3), R(4), E(5). But R is absent, so we cannot use R.\n\nWhat about ""image""? I M A G E -> I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5). This fits the pattern. Letters: I, M, G are not in the absent list? Absent: C,R,N,S,L,T. So I, M, G are fine.\n\nSo ""image"" is I M A G E.\n\nAnother possibility: ""paged"": P A G E D -> but that\'s 5 letters? Pattern: P(1) A(2) G(3) E(4) D(5) -> here A is in position 2, not 3. Doesn\'t fit.\n\n""gauge"": G A U G E -> A in position 2.\n\n""quake"": we had that: Q(1) U(2) A(3) K(4) E(5) -> acceptable.\n\n""drape"": D R A P E -> R is absent, so no.\n\n""maize"": M A I Z E -> but A is in position 2? Pattern: M(1) A(2) I(3) Z(4) E(5) -> A is in position 2, not 3. We need the third letter to be A.\n\nSo we need: [1][2]A[4]E.\n\nOther words: \n- ""dance"": D A N C E -> but N and C are absent, so no.\n- ""fable"": F A B L E -> L absent.\n- ""cable"": C absent.\n\nMaybe ""abate"": A B A T E -> but T is absent (from guess2: T is x) and S,L,T are absent. So T is out.\n\nWhat about ""beige"": B E I G E -> E is in position 2? Pattern: B(1) E(2) I(3) G(4) E(5) -> E in position 2 and 5? We know E is in position 5, but we don\'t have any information about position 2 yet. However, the third letter is I, not A. So doesn\'t fit.\n\nBack to ""image"": I M A G E -> positions: I(1), M(2), A(3), G(4), E(5). All letters I, M, G are allowed.\n\nQuake: Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> Q, U, K allowed.\n\nBut ""image"" uses more common letters? M, G, I are more common than Q and U.\n\nAnother word: ""badge"": B A D G E -> A in position 2? No.\n\n""value"": V A L U E -> L absent.\n\n""hazel"": H A Z E L -> only 5 letters? Pattern: H(1), A(2), Z(3), E(4), L(5) -> no, because we need E in position 5? Wait, E is in position 4, and we have L in position 5? But the secret word has E in position 5, so position 4 cannot be E? Our pattern is _ _ A _ E, so the fourth letter must be something else and fifth is E.\n\nAnother idea: ""brake"": B R A K E -> R is absent.\n\n""flake"": F L A K E -> L absent.\n\n""jake"": not 5 letters.\n\n""ovate"": O V A T E -> but T is absent.\n\n""newer"": but E in position 5? Pattern: N E W E R -> N is absent? Also, no A in position 3.\n\n""adept"": A D E P T -> doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nPerhaps ""baghe"": not a word.\n\nI think ""image"" and ""quake"" are possible.\n\nAnother word: ""faine"" - not common? Or ""faire"" - not standard.\n\n""maize"": but again, A is in position 2.\n\nWait, we need the third letter to be A, so only words like [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E.\n\nLet me think of more:\n- ""glade"": G L A D E -> L absent? Guess2 said L is x, so no.\n- ""shade"": S H A D E -> S absent? Guess2 said S is x, so no.\n\nWhat about ""above""? A B O V E -> pattern: A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). Third letter is O, not A.\n\n""hate"": too short.\n\n""pate"": too short.\n\n""diode"": not matching.\n\nMaybe ""haute"": H A U T E -> T absent.\n\n""gauze"": G A U E? Wait, G A U Z E -> pattern: G(1), A(2), U(3), Z(4), E(5) -> third letter U, not A.\n\n""payee"": P A Y E E -> but E is in position 4? Pattern: P(1), A(2), Y(3), E(4), E(5) -> but we need E in position 5? And third letter is Y. So no.\n\nI\'m struggling. Let\'s try ""mange"": M A N G E -> N is absent? Yes, from guess1, N is x.\n\n""large"": L, R absent.\n\n""barge"": B A R G E -> R absent.\n\n""vague"": V A G U E -> A in position 2.\n\nBut we have ""image"": I M A G E\n\n""quake"": Q U A K E\n\n""ozone"": not matching pattern.\n\nAnother one: ""exile"": E X I L E -> L absent and pattern doesn\'t fit.\n\n""agape"": A G A P E -> but that\'s A in position1 and 3? Pattern: A(1) G(2) A(3) P(4) E(5). So that fits. Now, letters: A, G, P. We know A is already present and in position3, but we didn\'t test A in position1. And we know G and P haven\'t been tested? And A might be duplicated? Also, avoid C,R,N,S,L,T: G and P are not in that set? And A is allowed.\n\nSo ""agape"": A G A P E\n\nBut note: in guess1, we had A in position3 and it was correct, but we didn\'t test A in other positions. So it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""abate"" but T absent.\n\n""agape"" is a valid word meaning a state of wonder.\n\nAnother option: ""afire"": A F I R E -> but R is absent.\n\n""aside"": A S I D E -> S is absent.\n\nSo few options: ""image"", ""quake"", ""agape"".\n\nWe have to pick one.\n\nWe could also have ""bake"": too short? Or ""bakes"" - but S is absent.\n\nLet\'s consider ""jape"" - too short.\n\n""gaffe"": G A F F E -> pattern: G(1) A(2) F(3) F(4) E(5) -> third letter F, not A.\n\nI think ""image"", ""agape"", and ""quake"" are among the few.\n\nWhich one gives us more information?\n\n""image"" uses I, M, G.\n""agape"" uses A, G, P. But note: we already know A is in the word? And we know it is in position 3. But if we use A in position1, we might get:\n- If A is also in the secret word at position1, it would be marked with \'-\' or \'✓\'? Actually, if the secret word has A in position1, we would get ✓ for position1 and ✓ for position3? But we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, ""quake"" uses Q, U, K which are less common, so it might be less informative.\n\nTherefore, I prefer ""image"" or ""agape"".\n\nLet me list the positions:\n\nSecret must be: [1][2]A[4]E\n\nIn ""agape"": \n- position1: A -> if the secret has A at position1, we\'d get ✓ for position1? But we know A is at position3. Could there be two A\'s? Yes.\n- position2: G\n- position4: P\n\nIn ""image"":\n- position1: I\n- position2: M\n- position4: G\n\nSince we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters, both are possible.\n\nBut to be safe, let\'s choose ""image"" because it tests three entirely new letters: I, M, G.\n\nWhereas ""agape"" tests G and P, but also A in position1 which we already have in the word (but we don\'t know where else it might be).\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we want to maximize new information.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll choose ""image"".\n\nWe\'ll guess ""image"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: is ""image"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.\n\nSo: <guess>image</guess>\n\nWe must remember the absent letters: C,R,N,S,L,T are not in the word.\n\nBy using ""image"", if we get new \'x\', then we know I, M, G are absent too? Or if we get some marks, we\'ll know more.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **crane**: A (3rd) and E (5th) are correct; C, R, N are absent.\n- **slate**: A (3rd) and E (5th) are correct; S, L, T are absent.\n\nThe secret word pattern is: `_ _ A _ E` (with A in position 3 and E in position 5).  \nAbsent letters to avoid: **C, R, N, S, L, T**.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Keep **A** in position 3 and **E** in position 5.\n- Test new common letters not in the absent set (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, M, P).\n- Prioritize high-frequency letters to maximize information.\n\nI chose **""image""** because:\n- It fits the pattern `_ _ A _ E` → **I M A G E**.\n- Uses **I**, **M**, and **G** (all new, high-frequency letters not excluded).\n- Avoids all absent letters (C, R, N, S, L, T).\n\nThis tests:\n- Position 1: **I** (new)\n- Position 2: **M** (new)\n- Position 4: **G** (new)\n\n<guess>image</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(x) L(x) A(✓) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: image -> FEEDBACK: I(x) M(x) A(✓) G(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from three guesses:\n1. crane: A(3rd position) and E(5th position) are correct; C, R, N are absent.\n2. slate: A(3rd) and E(5th) are correct; S, L, T are absent.\n3. image: A(3rd) and E(5th) are correct; I, M, G are absent.\n\nSo now, we know:\n- Secret word pattern: _ _ A _ E\n- Absent letters: C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G\n\nThus, the set of disallowed letters is: {C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G}\n\nThe available letters are: B, D, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need to form a valid English word that fits the pattern: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E, and uses only the available letters.\n\nLet\'s think of possible words:\n\n- Position 1: We need a consonant or vowel from the available set. Common consonants left: B, D, F, H, K, P, V, W, Y\n- Position 2: Similar, but note that position 3 is A, so position 2 should be such that the word exists.\n- Position 4: Must be a letter that can precede E.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""abase"": But S is absent? Yes, S is in the disallowed set. So no.\n- ""abate"": But T is absent? Yes, T is disallowed. So no.\n- ""above"": O is in the available set? Yes, but let\'s check: A B O V E -> Positions: A(1), B(2), O(3), V(4), E(5). But we need the third position to be A, but here O is in third? No. Also, pattern requires third to be A, so this doesn\'t fit.\n\nWe need the pattern: [1][2]A[4]E\n\nFor example:\n- ""quake"": Already considered earlier, but Q U A K E -> U is allowed? Disallowed letters are C,R,N,S,L,T,I,M,G. So Q, U, K are allowed. But we tried ""image"" with similar constraints? No, now we know I, M, G are also absent.\n\n""quake"": Q(1), U(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> Letters: Q, U, K are in available set? Yes. So if ""quake"" wasn\'t already tried, we can use it.\n\nSimilarly:\n- ""vague"": V A G U E -> Pattern: V(1), A(2), G(3), U(4), E(5) -> But A is in position 2, not 3? And G is disallowed? Yes, G is absent (from image: G is x). So no.\n\n""jade"": Not 5 letters.\n\n""fame"": Not 5.\n\n""payee"": P A Y E E -> Pattern: P(1), A(2), Y(3), E(4), E(5) -> Third letter is Y? Not A. So no.\n\n""diode"": Not matching.\n\nAnother word: ""paste"": But S and T are absent.\n\n""bake"": Too short.\n\nPerhaps ""pause"": But P A U S E -> S is absent.\n\nSince A is in position 3, we look for words like XXaXe.\n\nAfter brainstorming:\n\n- ""quake"": As above. Q, U, K available.\n- ""awake"": But S? No, A W A K E -> Pattern: A(1), W(2), A(3), K(4), E(5). So that fits. Now, letters: A, W, K. Disallowed: We must check A is already known? But we haven\'t tested W and K? And A is allowed? However, we already tested A in position 3 and it is present. We haven\'t tested A in position 1? But in the disallowed set, A is not disallowed. We know A is present? Exactly, and we know it is in position 3, but it might be in other positions? The previous feedback didn\'t rule out that possibility.\n\nBut for feedback, if we guess ""awake"":\n- Position 1: A -> could be marked as \'x\' if not present, or \'-\' if present but wrong spot, or \'✓\' if correct.\n- Position 2: W\n- Position 3: A -> already known correct? So ✓\n- Position 4: K\n- Position 5: E -> ✓\n\nNow, letters: A, W, K. W and K are in available set.\n\nBut note: we know A is present from the first guess? Yes, but only that it is in position 3? We don\'t know if there is another A. Similarly, we haven\'t tested A in position 1.\n\nMoreover, ""awake"" uses two A\'s? Well, one in position 1 and one in position 3. So we are testing for duplicate A.\n\nBut is ""awake"" acceptable? Yes.\n\nAnother word: ""abuse"": But S is absent? Yes.\n\n""adage"": A D A G E -> Disallowed: G is absent. So no.\n\n""afire"": F? But R is absent? R is disallowed. So no.\n\n""agape"": We considered but G is absent? Yes, from image: G is x. So no.\n\n""ahead"": A H E A D? Pattern: A H E A D? No. Pattern should be _ _ A _ E? Not matching.\n\nSo few options: ""quake"" and ""awake"".\n\nWhat about ""broke"": But R absent? R is disallowed? Yes.\n\n""brake"": R absent.\n\nTherefore, let\'s try ""awake"": A W A K E\n\nBut note: position 1 is A, which hasn\'t been tested? We know A is in the word, but only that it is in position 3? So if the secret word does not have A in position 1, we might get A marked as \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly, ""quake"" doesn\'t use A.\n\nTo test, we can pick one.\n\nAnother possibility: ""gauze"": But not matching pattern.\n\nOr ""ozone"": not matching.\n\nPerhaps ""evade"": E V A D E -> Pattern: E(1), V(2), A(3), D(4), E(5). This fits? Yes. And letters: E, V, D. Now, E: we know E is present in position 5? But we haven\'t tested E in position 1? So possible.\n\nDisallowed letters: E is not disallowed? Disallowed are C,R,N,S,L,T,I,M,G. So E, V, D are all allowed.\n\nMoreover, in ""evade"":\n- Position 1: E -> new\n- Position 2: V -> new\n- Position 4: D -> new\n\nThis tests three new letters: E, V, D.\n\nIs ""evade"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""exile"": But L and E in position 1? Pattern: E X I L E -> I and L disallowed? I (from image: I is x) and L disallowed. So skip.\n\n""exile"": I and L absent? Yes.\n\n""evoke"": E V O K E -> Pattern: E(1), V(2), O(3), K(4), E(5). But third position is O, not A? Doesn\'t fit.\n\nOnly ""evade"" and similar.\n\nAnother word: ""erase"": But S absent? Yes.\n\n""elate"": L and T absent? Yes.\n\nTherefore, we have three candidates: ""quake"", ""awake"", ""evade"".\n\nLet\'s compare:\n- ""quake"": Q, U, K -> less common letters.\n- ""awake"": A, W, K -> uses A again? Which we might know something about.\n- ""evade"": E, V, D -> tests E in position 1.\n\nWe don\'t know if E is duplicated? We know E is in position 5, but maybe in other positions? Similarly for A.\n\nSo all are possible.\n\nTo maximize new letters, avoid testing letters we already know are present? But we are limited. We must test positions 1,2,4.\n\n""evade"" tests E (which we know is in the word) but we don\'t know about position 1.\n\nSimilarly, ""awake"" tests A again.\n\nWhereas ""quake"" uses entirely new letters: Q, U, K.\n\nBut since Q and U are rare, it might be less efficient.\n\nWe need to pick based on word validity and commonness.\n\nBut the absence list is large, so few words might exist.\n\nAnother word: ""owing"": Not matching.\n\n""adobe"": A D O B E -> Pattern: A(1), D(2), O(3), B(4), E(5). Third position O? Not A.\n\n""anode"": N absent? Yes.\n\n""apace"": A P A C E -> Position 1: A, 2: P, 3: A, 4: C. But C is absent? Yes from guess1: C is x. So skip.\n\n""arose"": R, S absent.\n\nPerhaps ""evade"" is the best? Because E, V, D are relatively common.\n\nAnd ""evade"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""okapi"": Not ending with E? Pattern doesn\'t fit.\n\nI think we should go with ""evade"".\n\n""evade"" would be: E V A D E\n\nBut note: position 4 is D? And position 5 E? But it\'s E V A D E.\n\nNow, let us write: E(1), V(2), A(3), D(4), E(5)\n\nWe know E is in position 5? So if we guess E in position 1, if the secret word does not have E in position 1, we might get feedback as \'-\' (meaning E is in the word? Because E is already known to be in position 5) or \'x\' if E is not duplicated? Wait, the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplication explicitly? But the rules: each letter is marked independently.\n\nSpecifically:\n- If the secret word does not have another E besides position 5, then position 1 E would be marked as \'x\'? But wait, not necessarily: if there is another E? But we don\'t know.\n\nThe feedback symbol:\n- ✓ if the letter is correct in that position.\n- \'-\' if the letter is in the word but wrong position.\n- \'x\' if the letter is not in the word.\n\nIn ""evade"":\n- Position 1: E -> could be marked as:\n  - \'✓\' if the secret has E in position 1? But we know E is in position 5? So if E is also in position 1, we could get ✓.\n  - \'-\' if the secret has another E? Or an E in another position? But we know E is in position 5? So if E is not in position1, but there is an E somewhere else? But currently, we only know about position5 E. So if the secret word has only one E (in position 5), then E in position1 will be marked as \'x\'.\n  - If it has two E\'s (one in position5 and another elsewhere), then E in position1 might be \'-\' if that other position is not position1, etc.\n\nSimilarly for ""awake"" with two A\'s.\n\nSince we are constrained, let\'s choose ""evade"".\n\nAnother word: ""bade"": short? No, we need 5 letters. ""bated"": T absent.\n\n""deane"": not common.\n\n""heave"": H E A V E -> Pattern: H(1) E(2) A(3) V(4) E(5). This fits? Yes. But E(2) and E(5). Letters: H, E, V. Disallowed: E is allowed? Disallowed set has C,R,N,S,L,T,I,M,G? So H, E, V are available.\n\nSo ""heave"": H(1) E(2) A(3) V(4) E(5)\n\nSimilarly, ""leave"": L absent? Yes.\n\nTherefore, ""heave"" is possible? But note that E is used? We know E is present? We haven\'t tested E in position2?

We are given feedback from four guesses:
1. crane: A(✓), E(✓), and C(x), R(x), N(x)
2. slate: A(✓), E(✓), and S(x), L(x), T(x)
3. image: A(✓), E(✓), and I(x), M(x), G(x)
4. evade: E(-), V(x), A(✓), D(x), E(✓)

Analyzing the feedback:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ _ A _ E
- The third letter is A (correct in all guesses) and the fifth letter is E (correct in all guesses).

Absent letters (marked 'x' in all positions they've appeared): 
- From crane: C, R, N
- From slate: S, L, T
- From image: I, M, G
- From evade: V, D

So, the disallowed letters are: C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G, V, D

Available letters: B, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

Important note: In ""evade"", we saw that the first E was marked as (-) meaning that E is in the word but not in position 1. We already know E is in position 5, so this confirms there is only one E? Not necessarily: it might have more than one E? But the feedback for ""evade"" shows:
- Position 1: E(-) -> E is in the word but not at position 1.
- Position 5: E(✓) -> E is at position 5.

But it doesn't tell us if E appears twice. However, since we have E at position 1 marked as '-', it means that E is present elsewhere? But we already know about position 5. So if there were two E's, we might still have the same feedback? Actually, if the secret word had two E's, one at position 5 and say at position 2, then position 1 E might be marked as '-' because of the position 2 E? But in our case, we don't know about other positions.

However, for the secret word, we know:
- Only one E? Not necessarily: the '-' feedback for position 1 E indicates that there is at least one E elsewhere? But we already have position 5 E. So this doesn't provide new information about E duplication? Actually, it confirms that E is present at least once besides position 1? Which we already know from position 5? Therefore, it's consistent with the secret word having E only at position 5: because then the E at position 1 is wrong and would be 'x'? But wait, we got '-' meaning that E is present but not at position 1? Because if it were only at position 5, and we didn't guess position 5 in the first position? No: the rule for '-' is that the letter is in the word but not in that position. So if the word has E at position 5 and only that one E, then E at position 1 is not correct? So it should be marked as '-'? Because E is in the word, but not at position 1? So we didn't learn anything new about duplication? We already knew E is in the word.

Therefore, the '-' for E at position 1 is simply telling us that position 1 is not E? And since E is in the word at position 5? That was already known? So no new information? Actually, we learn that E is not at position 1? But we already knew position 5 E? So we can't infer duplication? Correct.

So in short, the secret word has:
- At least one E (at position 5) and E does not appear at position 1? We don't know about other positions.

Similarly, we don't know about duplication of A? Etc.

But back to the pattern: _ _ A _ E

Now, from the feedback for ""evade"":
- Position 1: E(-) -> E is in the word (we know) but not at position 1? Which we already knew? So new info: position 1 cannot be E? But we knew that? Actually, we didn't know if E could be at position 1? Now we know: E is not at position 1? Because we got '-', meaning E is in the word (we know) but not at this position.

Additionally:
- Position 2: V(x) -> V is absent? So V is added to the disallowed set.
- Position 4: D(x) -> D is absent? So D is added to disallowed.

Therefore, the disallowed letters now are: C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G, V, D

Available: B, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z

We need a word: [letter1][letter2]A[letter4]E

With letter1, letter2, letter4 from the available set? And not using any disallowed letters.

Possible words? Very few.

Let's brainstorm:
- ""above"": But O in position 3? Not matching pattern (we need A in position 3).
- ""pause"": S absent? S is disallowed.

Perhaps ""quake"": Q U A K E? But U and K are available? Disallowed: C,R,N,...D,V? U and K are not in disallowed? Disallowed: C,R,N,S,L,T,I,M,G,V,D? So Q, U, K are allowed? Yes.

Similarly: ""awake"": A W A K E? But A in position 1? Letters: A, W, K. A is allowed? We haven't tested A in position 1? And W and K are available.

But wait in ""awake"": 
- Position 1: A? We don't know if it is present? But we know A is in position 3? So if A appears elsewhere, okay? Or not.

What about ""fable"": But L and B? L disallowed? So skip.

Another idea: ""payee"": But P A Y E E? Pattern: P(1), A(2), Y(3), E(4), E(5)? Doesn't match? We need A in position 3? So Y in position 3? Not good.

Perhaps ""hyena"": H Y E N A? Pattern: H(1), Y(2), E(3), N(4), A(5)? Doesn't match.

We need XXaXe.

Possible words with available letters:
- ""jape"": Too short.
- ""okafe"": Not a word.
- ""pawne"": Not a real word.
- ""queue"": Not matching pattern.

Valid word: ""beige"": But E in position? Pattern: B E I G E? G disallowed? And I disallowed? Also third position is I? Not A.

Another: ""wooer"": Not matching.

Perhaps ""agape"": But G disallowed? From image: G is x. So no.

We have ""bake"": Too short.

""cake"": C disallowed.

""fake"": F A K E? Too short? And no third letter A? Pattern: F(1) A(2) K(3) E(4) -> no fifth letter? So not 5 letters.

""shake"": S disallowed.

Therefore, ""quake"" and ""awake"" may be the only common words.

""quake"": Q(1) U(2) A(3) K(4) E(5)? Letters: Q, U, K? All allowed? Yes? And disallowed set doesn't include Q, U, K.

""awake"": A(1) W(2) A(3) K(4) E(5)? A at position 1: we haven't tested? And W and K? Available? Yes.

We need to choose one. Let's pick ""awake"" to test for duplication? But we may lose a guess? Or ""quake""?

But ""quake"" uses Q which is very rare? So less common? So ""awake"" might be more likely? Or not? We don't know.

Another word: ""ozone"": O(1) Z(2) O(3) N(4) E(5) -> N disallowed? N is in disallowed? Yes.

""alone"": L, O? L disallowed? Yes.

""phone"": P H O N E? N disallowed? Yes.

Therefore, I think ""awake"" is a reasonable choice? But note in ""awake"", A at position 1? We know A is present at position 3? So if we guess A at position 1, we might get:
- If the secret word has A in position 1: ✓
- Else: '-' if there are extra A? Or 'x' if only one A? But we don't know.

In the previous feedback for ""crane"", ""slate"", ""image"", ""evade"", there was no indication of an extra A? But we didn't test A in other positions.

I think we have to try? There are only a few possible words.

Perhaps ""payne"": Not matching? P A Y N E? Third letter Y? Not A.

So I choose ""awake"".

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ A _ E` (with **A** fixed in position 3 and **E** in position 5).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, S, L, T, I, M, G, V, D (all marked ""x"" in at least one guess).
- **Available letters**: B, F, H, J, K, O, P, Q, U, W, X, Y, Z.
- **Additional insight from Guess 4 (evade)**: 
  - `E(-)` confirms **E** is not in position 1 (though it is in position 5).
  - `V(x)` and `D(x)` add **V** and **D** to the absent list.

For the new guess:
- Must retain **A** in position 3 and **E** in position 5.
- Positions 1, 2, and 4 must use letters from the available set, avoiding absent letters.
- Prioritize testing new high-frequency letters (e.g., **K, W, B**) to cover more ground.

After evaluating possible words that fit `_ _ A _ E` and the constraints:
- **""awake""** was selected because it uses `A W A K E`:
  - Tests **A** in position 1 (possible duplication? Feedback will clarify).
  - Tests **W** (new, position 2) and **K** (new, position 4).
  - Avoids all absent letters.
  - Valid English word (meaning: to stop sleeping).

This guess may reveal:
- If **A** appears elsewhere (via position 1 feedback).
- If **W** or **K** are present/correctly positioned.
