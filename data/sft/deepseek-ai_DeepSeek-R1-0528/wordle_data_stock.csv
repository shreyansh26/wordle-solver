 A good starting word should have common letters and no repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in 5-letter words: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

 I recall that words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROAST"", ""RAISE"" are often recommended.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common and distinct.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the secret word but in the wrong position)
 R: x (R is not in the secret word)
 A: x (A is not in the secret word)
 N: x (N is not in the secret word)
 E: x (E is not in the secret word)

 So, from this feedback:
 - The secret word contains the letter 'C', but not in the first position.
 - The letters R, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word has the letter 'C' and it must be in one of the positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it's not in position 1).

 Also, we know that the secret word does not contain: R, A, N, E.

 Since we have only one letter that is present ('C'), we need to choose a new word that:
 1. Contains the letter 'C' (but not in the first position, because in ""crane"" it was in position 1 and that was wrong).
 2. Avoids the letters R, A, N, E.

 Additionally, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think of common letters that are not R, A, N, E. Some common letters: S, T, O, I, L, D, U, M, P, etc.

 We also note that the word must be 5 letters and a valid English word.

 We can try a word that has 'C' in a different position (say position 2, 3, 4, or 5) and includes other common letters.

 Since the feedback tells us that 'C' is not in position 1, we can try putting 'C' in position 2, for example.

 Let's consider the word ""SCALP"", but note that 'A' is already known to be absent (from the first feedback) so we cannot use 'A'. Similarly, we must avoid R, A, N, E.

 Another idea: ""CLOUD"" - but let's check the letters: C (position 1) -> but we know that in the secret word, C is not in position 1? Actually, in our first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So in the secret word, C is not in position 1. But in ""CLOUD"", C is in position 1 again, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid putting C in position 1.

 We need a word that has 'C' in a position other than 1.

 Let's try to put 'C' in position 2. For example, the word ""SCENT"" but note that 'E' and 'N' are absent (from first feedback) so we cannot use them.

 We must avoid: R, A, N, E.

 So, what words have 'C' in position 2 and without R, A, N, E?

 Possibilities: 
   Position 1: any letter except R, A, N, E and also not C (because we are putting C in position 2) but actually we can have any letter that is allowed.
   Position 2: C
   Positions 3,4,5: letters that are not R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of words: 
   ""SCULP"" - not a common word? 
   ""SCUFF"" - has two F's? 
   ""SCOFF"" - but O and F? 
   ""SCOWL"" - let's check: S, C, O, W, L. None of these are in the absent list (R, A, N, E). 

 But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CLOCK"" but that has C in position 1 and 2? We know position 1 cannot be C. Also, we are avoiding putting C in position 1. So ""CLOCK"" is invalid because the first letter is C.

 Another word: ""FOCUS"" - but F, O, C, U, S. Here, C is in position 3. That's acceptable. Also, the letters F, O, U, S are not in the absent list (R, A, N, E). So ""FOCUS"" is a candidate.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We know that the secret word has a 'C' somewhere. By putting 'C' in a different position (like 3) we can test if it is in position 3.

 Another candidate: ""MUSIC"" - but M, U, S, I, C. C is at the end (position 5). Also, the letters are M, U, S, I, C - none of which are R, A, N, E.

 However, we have only 6 tries and we want to get as much information as possible. We might want to use a word that has more common consonants.

 Let me think of words that have 'C' in position 2: 
   ""SCUBA"" -> but 'A' is absent -> invalid.
   ""SCION"" -> 'N' is absent -> invalid.
   ""SCOOP"" -> O and P, but two O's? 
   ""SCOWL"" as I thought earlier: S, C, O, W, L.

 ""SCOWL"": 
   S in position 1, C in position 2, O in position 3, W in position 4, L in position 5.

 This word uses the letters: S, C, O, W, L. We haven't tested S, O, W, L yet. And we know C is present but not in position 1, so we are testing position 2 for C.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has 'C' in position 4 or 5? But we don't have any information about other positions.

 Since we have to avoid R, A, N, E, and we have many letters to test, I think ""SCOWL"" is a reasonable guess.

 But note: we are not forced to put C in position 2. We could put it in position 3, 4, or 5. However, by putting it in position 2, we are testing a specific position.

 Another common word: ""PITCH"" - P, I, T, C, H. Here, C is in position 4. Also, the letters P, I, T, H are new. This might be good.

 Let me compare:
   ""SCOWL"": tests S, C (at 2), O, W, L.
   ""PITCH"": tests P, I, T, C (at 4), H.

 Both are valid and use new letters.

 But note: we have only one known present letter (C) and we are trying to find its position. If we put C in position 4 and it turns out to be in position 2, we won't learn about position 2. However, if we put it in position 2 and it is correct, we get a check. If it is not, then we know it's not in position 2 and we can try other positions.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has multiple possible positions for C? But that might be difficult.

 Since we have no other information, I think it's acceptable to choose a word that tests a specific position for C and also introduces new common letters.

 I'll go with ""PITCH"" because it has more common letters (like T, H) and C is in a different position (4). But note that we are avoiding E, and P, I, T, C, H are all allowed.

 However, let me check if there are words that have C in position 2 and also include very common letters. 

 Another word: ""SHOCK"" - S, H, O, C, K. C is in position 4? Actually: 
   S (1), H (2), O (3), C (4), K (5). So C is in position 4.

 How about ""CLIMB""? But that has C in position 1 -> invalid.

 ""BLOCK"" -> B, L, O, C, K. C is in position 4.

 ""STOCK"" -> S, T, O, C, K. C in position 4.

 But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. We are assuming no duplicates for now.

 After considering, I think ""PITCH"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests C in position 4.

 However, let me also consider ""SLICK"": S, L, I, C, K. C is in position 4. But we haven't tested I and K.

 But we have to avoid R, A, N, E. So ""SLICK"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""SMOCK"": S, M, O, C, K -> C in position 4.

 I think I'll go with ""PITCH"" because it has T and H which are very common.

 So, my next guess is ""PITCH"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has C in position 2? Then in ""PITCH"", the C would be marked as absent? No, because the feedback for a letter that is present but in the wrong position is marked with '-'. So if C is in the word but not in position 4, then we would get a '-' for C. And we would know that position 4 is not correct, but it is still present.

 However, we already know that C is present. So we are trying to find its position.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C in a position that we haven't tested and also includes other common letters.

 Since we have no constraints on other letters, I think ""PITCH"" is a good choice.

 Let me check if ""PITCH"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

 Therefore, I will guess ""PITCH"".

 But note: we must avoid the absent letters. ""PITCH"" has P, I, T, C, H. None of these are R, A, N, E. So it's valid.

 So, the guess is ""PITCH"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R, A, N, E are absent.
- The secret word contains C, so the next guess must include C in a position other than 1, while avoiding R, A, N, E.

I chose ""pitch"" because:
- It places C in position 4 to test a new location.
- It introduces new common letters (P, I, T, H) to gather more information.
- It avoids the absent letters (R, A, N, E).

 Let's consider the word ""SCALP"", but note that 'A' is already known to be absent (from the first feedback) so we cannot use 'A'. Similarly, we must avoid R, A, N, E.

 Another idea: ""CLOUD"" - but let's check the letters: C (position 1) -> but we know that in the secret word, C is not in position 1? Actually, in our first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So in the secret word, C is not in position 1. But in ""CLOUD"", C is in position 1 again, which we know is incorrect. So we should avoid putting C in position 1.

 We need a word that has 'C' in a position other than 1.

 Let's try to put 'C' in position 2. For example, the word ""SCENT"" but note that 'E' and 'N' are absent (from first feedback) so we cannot use them.

 We must avoid: R, A, N, E.

 So, what words have 'C' in position 2 and without R, A, N, E?

 Possibilities: 
   Position 1: any letter except R, A, N, E and also not C (because we are putting C in position 2) but actually we can have any letter that is allowed.
   Position 2: C
   Positions 3,4,5: letters that are not R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of words: 
   ""SCULP"" - not a common word? 
   ""SCUFF"" - has two F's? 
   ""SCOFF"" - but O and F? 
   ""SCOWL"" - let's check: S, C, O, W, L. None of these are in the absent list (R, A, N, E). 

 But note: we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CLOCK"" but that has C in position 1 and 2? We know position 1 cannot be C. Also, we are avoiding putting C in position 1. So ""CLOCK"" is invalid because the first letter is C.

 Another word: ""FOCUS"" - but F, O, C, U, S. Here, C is in position 3. That's acceptable. Also, the letters F, O, U, S are not in the absent list (R, A, N, E). So ""FOCUS"" is a candidate.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We know that the secret word has a 'C' somewhere. By putting 'C' in a different position (like 3) we can test if it is in position 3.

 Another candidate: ""MUSIC"" - but M, U, S, I, C. C is at the end (position 5). Also, the letters are M, U, S, I, C - none of which are R, A, N, E.

 However, we have only 6 tries and we want to get as much information as possible. We might want to use a word that has more common consonants.

 Let me think of words that have 'C' in position 2: 
   ""SCUBA"" -> but 'A' is absent -> invalid.
   ""SCION"" -> 'N' is absent -> invalid.
   ""SCOOP"" -> O and P, but two O's? 
   ""SCOWL"" as I thought earlier: S, C, O, W, L.

 ""SCOWL"": 
   S in position 1, C in position 2, O in position 3, W in position 4, L in position 5.

 This word uses the letters: S, C, O, W, L. We haven't tested S, O, W, L yet. And we know C is present but not in position 1, so we are testing position 2 for C.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has 'C' in position 4 or 5? But we don't have any information about other positions.

 Since we have to avoid R, A, N, E, and we have many letters to test, I think ""SCOWL"" is a reasonable guess.

 But note: we are not forced to put C in position 2. We could put it in position 3, 4, or 5. However, by putting it in position 2, we are testing a specific position.

 Another common word: ""PITCH"" - P, I, T, C, H. Here, C is in position 4. Also, the letters P, I, T, H are new. This might be good.

 Let me compare:
   ""SCOWL"": tests S, C (at 2), O, W, L.
   ""PITCH"": tests P, I, T, C (at 4), H.

 Both are valid and use new letters.

 But note: we have only one known present letter (C) and we are trying to find its position. If we put C in position 4 and it turns out to be in position 2, we won't learn about position 2. However, if we put it in position 2 and it is correct, we get a check. If it is not, then we know it's not in position 2 and we can try other positions.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has multiple possible positions for C? But that might be difficult.

 Since we have no other information, I think it's acceptable to choose a word that tests a specific position for C and also introduces new common letters.

 I'll go with ""PITCH"" because it has more common letters (like T, H) and C is in a different position (4). But note that we are avoiding E, and P, I, T, C, H are all allowed.

 However, let me check if there are words that have C in position 2 and also include very common letters. 

 Another word: ""SHOCK"" - S, H, O, C, K. C is in position 4? Actually: 
   S (1), H (2), O (3), C (4), K (5). So C is in position 4.

 How about ""CLIMB""? But that has C in position 1 -> invalid.

 ""BLOCK"" -> B, L, O, C, K. C is in position 4.

 ""STOCK"" -> S, T, O, C, K. C in position 4.

 But note: we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. We are assuming no duplicates for now.

 After considering, I think ""PITCH"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests C in position 4.

 However, let me also consider ""SLICK"": S, L, I, C, K. C is in position 4. But we haven't tested I and K.

 But we have to avoid R, A, N, E. So ""SLICK"" is valid.

 Alternatively, ""SMOCK"": S, M, O, C, K -> C in position 4.

 I think I'll go with ""PITCH"" because it has T and H which are very common.

 So, my next guess is ""PITCH"".

 But wait, what if the secret word has C in position 2? Then in ""PITCH"", the C would be marked as absent? No, because the feedback for a letter that is present but in the wrong position is marked with '-'. So if C is in the word but not in position 4, then we would get a '-' for C. And we would know that position 4 is not correct, but it is still present.

 However, we already know that C is present. So we are trying to find its position.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that has C in a position that we haven't tested and also includes other common letters.

 Since we have no constraints on other letters, I think ""PITCH"" is a good choice.

 Let me check if ""PITCH"" is a valid word: yes, it is.

 Therefore, I will guess ""PITCH"".

 But note: we must avoid the absent letters. ""PITCH"" has P, I, T, C, H. None of these are R, A, N, E. So it's valid.

 So, the guess is ""PITCH"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is present but in the wrong position (not position 1).
- R, A, N, E are absent.
- The secret word contains C, so the next guess must include C in a position other than 1, while avoiding R, A, N, E.

I chose ""pitch"" because:
- It places C in position 4 to test a new location.
- It introduces new common letters (P, I, T, H) to gather more information.
- It avoids the absent letters (R, A, N, E).

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(-) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Meaning:
  C is present but not in position 1 (since it was in position 1 and marked as wrong position).
  R, A, N, E are absent.

Guess 2: ""pitch"" -> Feedback: P(x) I(x) T(-) C(✓) H(x)
Meaning:
  P is absent (x)
  I is absent (x)
  T is present but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 and marked as wrong position)
  C is present and in the correct position (position 4, because in ""pitch"", C is the 4th letter) -> so the secret word has C in the 4th position.
  H is absent (x)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter C in the 4th position.
2. The secret word has the letter T, but not in position 3 (and not in position 1 because in ""crane"" we didn't have T, but wait, ""crane"" didn't have T so we didn't test it. Actually, we didn't have T in the first guess, so we don't know about position 1 for T. However, in the second guess, T was in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So T is in the word, but not in position 3.
3. The following letters are absent: R, A, N, E, P, I, H.

Also, from the first guess, we know that the secret word has a C that is not in position 1, and now we know it is in position 4. So that condition is satisfied.

Now, the known information:
- Position 4: C
- The word contains T (but not in position 3) and C (in position 4).
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, I, H.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has C in the 4th position.
- Contains T (but not in position 3) and possibly in a new position to test.
- Avoids the absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, I, H.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

What letters are left? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, T, H. 
Available common letters: S, O, L, U, D, M, Y, G, B, etc.

We know T is present, so we must include T in the next guess. But we cannot put it in position 3 (because we know it's not there) and we haven't tested other positions.

Possible positions for T: 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is ruled out and position 4 is C).

We can try to put T in position 1 or 2 or 5 to test.

Also, we need to fill the other positions with new letters to get more information.

Let's try to form a word that has:
- Position 4: C
- T in one of the positions: 1, 2, or 5.
- The other three positions with new letters (not in the absent list).

For example, if we put T in position 1:
  T _ _ C _
We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 with letters not in {R, A, N, E, P, I, H} and not C (since we already know C is in 4, and we don't know about duplicates? We assume no duplicates for now, but it's possible. However, to be safe, we should avoid duplicates unless necessary).

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicates. We'll assume no duplicates for simplicity until we have evidence.

So, for T in position 1: T _ _ C _
Possible words: 
  ""TALC"" -> but only 4 letters? We need 5.
  ""TALCS"" -> but S is allowed, and A is absent -> invalid because A is absent.
  ""TOMC"" -> not 5 letters.

Actually, we need 5 letters. Let me think of words ending with C in the 4th position? Actually, the word has 5 letters and the 4th is C, so the last letter is the 5th.

So pattern: T _ _ C ?

We can have: T _ _ C S, T _ _ C K, T _ _ C T (but T is already used? and we don't know about duplicates) -> avoid for now.

But note: we have T already in position 1, so we cannot use T again if we assume no duplicates.

So, T in position 1, then positions 2,3,5 must be new letters and not T.

Possible words: 
  ""TUNIC"" -> but U, N, I: N and I are absent -> invalid.
  ""TOPIC"" -> O, P, I: P and I are absent -> invalid.
  ""TRACK"" -> R and A are absent -> invalid.

It's hard to find a word with T in 1 and C in 4 without using absent letters.

What about T in position 2?
Pattern: _ T _ C _

We need a letter for position 1, 3, and 5.

Possible words:
  ""STOCK"" -> S, T, O, C, K. But O and K are new. However, we have to check: S is new, O is new, K is new. And absent letters we have: R, A, N, E, P, I, H. So S, O, K are allowed.

But note: in ""STOCK"", the T is in position 2? Let's see: 
  Position 1: S
  Position 2: T
  Position 3: O
  Position 4: C
  Position 5: K

Yes. And we know T is present and not in position 3, so position 2 is a new position to test. Also, we are testing S, O, K.

But wait, we also know that in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was wrong, but now we are putting S in position 1. That's fine.

Another possibility: ""MUTCH"" -> but U, T, C, H. H is absent -> invalid.

""BATCH"" -> A is absent -> invalid.

So ""STOCK"" seems a candidate.

What about T in position 5?
Pattern: _ _ _ C T

We need to fill positions 1,2,3.

Possible words: 
  ""DUCTT"" -> not a word.
  ""EXACT"" -> E and A are absent -> invalid.
  ""REACT"" -> R, E, A absent -> invalid.
  ""TRACT"" -> R, A absent -> invalid.

It's hard to find one without absent letters.

So, putting T in position 2 (as in ""STOCK"") seems a good option.

But note: we have the letter T that we know is present, and we are testing it in position 2. Also, we are testing three new letters: S, O, K.

Alternatively, we could put T in position 1 and use other letters. For example, ""TUSC?"" -> not a word. ""TOSC?"" -> not common.

Another word with T in position 1 and C in 4: ""THUMB"" -> but H and U? H is absent -> invalid.

So, I think ""STOCK"" is a good candidate.

But wait, we have to consider that we already know T is not in position 3, but we are not putting it there. And we are testing position 2 for T.

Also, we are testing S in position 1, O in position 3, and K in position 5.

We might also consider words that have T in position 5, but we couldn't find one without absent letters.

Another idea: what about ""OUTDO"" but that doesn't have C in position 4.

We must have C in position 4.

Another word: ""STOIC"" -> S, T, O, I, C. But I is absent -> invalid.

""STUCC"" -> not a word and duplicate C? We don't know.

""BLOCK"" -> B, L, O, C, K. This has C in position 4. And T is not included? But we must include T because we know T is in the word. So we cannot omit T.

We must include T because it is a present letter.

So, the word must contain T and have C in position 4.

Therefore, ""STOCK"" is a valid word that includes T (in position 2) and C (in position 4), and uses new letters S, O, K.

So, I will guess ""STOCK"".

But let me double-check the feedback we have:

First guess: crane -> C (wrong position), R absent, A absent, N absent, E absent.
Second guess: pitch -> P absent, I absent, T (present but wrong position), C (correct position), H absent.

So, in ""STOCK"":
  S: not tested before -> we can test it.
  T: we are putting it in position 2 (previously it was in position 3 and was wrong, so we are testing a new position).
  O: new letter.
  C: in position 4 (correct, so we expect it to be correct again).
  K: new letter.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, the next guess is ""STOCK"".
</think>
Based on the feedback:
- **C** is confirmed in position 4 (✓ from ""pitch"").
- **T** is present but not in position 3 (- from ""pitch"").
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, I, H (x from both guesses).

The secret word must:
- Have **C** in position 4.
- Include **T** (but not in position 3).
- Exclude R, A, N, E, P, I, H.

I chose ""stock"" because:
- It places **C** in position 4 (correct position).
- It tests **T** in position 2 (a new position to check, since position 3 is ruled out).
- It introduces new common letters: **S** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **K** (position 5) to gather more information.
- It avoids all absent letters.

  P is absent (x)
  I is absent (x)
  T is present but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 and marked as wrong position)
  C is present and in the correct position (position 4, because in ""pitch"", C is the 4th letter) -> so the secret word has C in the 4th position.
  H is absent (x)

So, from both guesses, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter C in the 4th position.
2. The secret word has the letter T, but not in position 3 (and not in position 1 because in ""crane"" we didn't have T, but wait, ""crane"" didn't have T so we didn't test it. Actually, we didn't have T in the first guess, so we don't know about position 1 for T. However, in the second guess, T was in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So T is in the word, but not in position 3.
3. The following letters are absent: R, A, N, E, P, I, H.

Also, from the first guess, we know that the secret word has a C that is not in position 1, and now we know it is in position 4. So that condition is satisfied.

Now, the known information:
- Position 4: C
- The word contains T (but not in position 3) and C (in position 4).
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, I, H.

We need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has C in the 4th position.
- Contains T (but not in position 3) and possibly in a new position to test.
- Avoids the absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, I, H.

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

What letters are left? We have used: C, R, A, N, E, P, I, T, H. 
Available common letters: S, O, L, U, D, M, Y, G, B, etc.

We know T is present, so we must include T in the next guess. But we cannot put it in position 3 (because we know it's not there) and we haven't tested other positions.

Possible positions for T: 1, 2, or 5 (since position 3 is ruled out and position 4 is C).

We can try to put T in position 1 or 2 or 5 to test.

Also, we need to fill the other positions with new letters to get more information.

Let's try to form a word that has:
- Position 4: C
- T in one of the positions: 1, 2, or 5.
- The other three positions with new letters (not in the absent list).

For example, if we put T in position 1:
  T _ _ C _
We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 with letters not in {R, A, N, E, P, I, H} and not C (since we already know C is in 4, and we don't know about duplicates? We assume no duplicates for now, but it's possible. However, to be safe, we should avoid duplicates unless necessary).

But note: we don't know if the word has duplicates. We'll assume no duplicates for simplicity until we have evidence.

So, for T in position 1: T _ _ C _
Possible words: 
  ""TALC"" -> but only 4 letters? We need 5.
  ""TALCS"" -> but S is allowed, and A is absent -> invalid because A is absent.
  ""TOMC"" -> not 5 letters.

Actually, we need 5 letters. Let me think of words ending with C in the 4th position? Actually, the word has 5 letters and the 4th is C, so the last letter is the 5th.

So pattern: T _ _ C ?

We can have: T _ _ C S, T _ _ C K, T _ _ C T (but T is already used? and we don't know about duplicates) -> avoid for now.

But note: we have T already in position 1, so we cannot use T again if we assume no duplicates.

So, T in position 1, then positions 2,3,5 must be new letters and not T.

Possible words: 
  ""TUNIC"" -> but U, N, I: N and I are absent -> invalid.
  ""TOPIC"" -> O, P, I: P and I are absent -> invalid.
  ""TRACK"" -> R and A are absent -> invalid.

It's hard to find a word with T in 1 and C in 4 without using absent letters.

What about T in position 2?
Pattern: _ T _ C _

We need a letter for position 1, 3, and 5.

Possible words:
  ""STOCK"" -> S, T, O, C, K. But O and K are new. However, we have to check: S is new, O is new, K is new. And absent letters we have: R, A, N, E, P, I, H. So S, O, K are allowed.

But note: in ""STOCK"", the T is in position 2? Let's see: 
  Position 1: S
  Position 2: T
  Position 3: O
  Position 4: C
  Position 5: K

Yes. And we know T is present and not in position 3, so position 2 is a new position to test. Also, we are testing S, O, K.

But wait, we also know that in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and it was wrong, but now we are putting S in position 1. That's fine.

Another possibility: ""MUTCH"" -> but U, T, C, H. H is absent -> invalid.

""BATCH"" -> A is absent -> invalid.

So ""STOCK"" seems a candidate.

What about T in position 5?
Pattern: _ _ _ C T

We need to fill positions 1,2,3.

Possible words: 
  ""DUCTT"" -> not a word.
  ""EXACT"" -> E and A are absent -> invalid.
  ""REACT"" -> R, E, A absent -> invalid.
  ""TRACT"" -> R, A absent -> invalid.

It's hard to find one without absent letters.

So, putting T in position 2 (as in ""STOCK"") seems a good option.

But note: we have the letter T that we know is present, and we are testing it in position 2. Also, we are testing three new letters: S, O, K.

Alternatively, we could put T in position 1 and use other letters. For example, ""TUSC?"" -> not a word. ""TOSC?"" -> not common.

Another word with T in position 1 and C in 4: ""THUMB"" -> but H and U? H is absent -> invalid.

So, I think ""STOCK"" is a good candidate.

But wait, we have to consider that we already know T is not in position 3, but we are not putting it there. And we are testing position 2 for T.

Also, we are testing S in position 1, O in position 3, and K in position 5.

We might also consider words that have T in position 5, but we couldn't find one without absent letters.

Another idea: what about ""OUTDO"" but that doesn't have C in position 4.

We must have C in position 4.

Another word: ""STOIC"" -> S, T, O, I, C. But I is absent -> invalid.

""STUCC"" -> not a word and duplicate C? We don't know.

""BLOCK"" -> B, L, O, C, K. This has C in position 4. And T is not included? But we must include T because we know T is in the word. So we cannot omit T.

We must include T because it is a present letter.

So, the word must contain T and have C in position 4.

Therefore, ""STOCK"" is a valid word that includes T (in position 2) and C (in position 4), and uses new letters S, O, K.

So, I will guess ""STOCK"".

But let me double-check the feedback we have:

First guess: crane -> C (wrong position), R absent, A absent, N absent, E absent.
Second guess: pitch -> P absent, I absent, T (present but wrong position), C (correct position), H absent.

So, in ""STOCK"":
  S: not tested before -> we can test it.
  T: we are putting it in position 2 (previously it was in position 3 and was wrong, so we are testing a new position).
  O: new letter.
  C: in position 4 (correct, so we expect it to be correct again).
  K: new letter.

This should give us good information.

Therefore, the next guess is ""STOCK"".Based on the feedback:
- **C** is confirmed in position 4 (✓ from ""pitch"").
- **T** is present but not in position 3 (- from ""pitch"").
- Absent letters: R, A, N, E, P, I, H (x from both guesses).

The secret word must:
- Have **C** in position 4.
- Include **T** (but not in position 3).
- Exclude R, A, N, E, P, I, H.

I chose ""stock"" because:
- It places **C** in position 4 (correct position).
- It tests **T** in position 2 (a new position to check, since position 3 is ruled out).
- It introduces new common letters: **S** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **K** (position 5) to gather more information.
- It avoids all absent letters.",Guess 3: stock -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) O(✓) C(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
