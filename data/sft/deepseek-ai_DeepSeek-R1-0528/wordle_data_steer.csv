Alright, let's start with my first guess. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a word that maximizes the amount of useful information I can get. This means selecting a word with common letters that might appear in many 5-letter English words.

I recall that many Wordle players start with words that contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. Vowels are crucial because almost every English word has at least one vowel. Among consonants, letters like R, S, T, L, and N appear frequently.

Considering this, a good starting word might be something like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another option is ""ROAST"". After thinking about it, ""CRANE"" seems solid because:

- It includes two vowels: A and E.
- Common consonants: C, R, N.

The vowel distribution seems good—E is the most common English letter, and A is also very frequent. Consonants like C, R, N are also quite common.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" could be another excellent choice due to the combination of S, L, A, T, E—all very common letters. But I decide to go with ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

So, I'll start by guessing ""CRANE"".
</think>
I need to make a first guess with no prior information. A strong opener should use common letters to maximize feedback potential. Ideal starting words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).  

""CRANE"" is an effective choice because:  
- It covers three vowels (A, E) and useful consonants (C, R, N).  
- Tests positions for high-frequency letters to narrow down possibilities faster.  
- Often recommended in strategy guides for optimal information gain.  

This guess will reveal:  
- Which letters exist/missing via ✓/-/x symbols.  
- Positional accuracy for 5 distinct letters.

Alright, let's analyze the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 

- C(x): Not in the word at all.  
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- A(x): Not in the word.  
- N(x): Not in the word.  
- E(-): E is in the word but wrong position.  

So, we know:  
1. **R** and **E** are definitely in the secret word, just not at positions 2 and 5 (since feedback shows wrong position).  
2. **C, A, N** are completely absent.  

Constraints for the next guess:  
- Must include R and E.  
- Exclude C, A, N.  
- Positions: R cannot be in spot 2 (tried there originally), E cannot be in spot 5.  

Since R and E exist, I should prioritize placing them in new positions. Possible slots for R: 1,3,4,5 (since position 2 was wrong). Possible slots for E: 1,2,3,4 (position 5 was wrong).  

Need a word with:  
- R in positions 1,3,4, or 5.  
- E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.  
- Avoid C,A,N entirely.  

Good candidate letters to test: Other common consonants like S,T,L,P,D,M since vowels A is out, so focus on remaining vowels (O,I,U) or consonants.  

Possible words:  
- Could try **RESET**? No—E repeated, and we risk duplicate letter issues. Better avoid duplicates for now.  
- **TRIBE**: Has R (position 1), E (position 5). But position 5 was originally E(-), meaning E isn't at end—so placing E at position 5 again would likely still be wrong. R at position 1 is new—could be correct?  
- **PERCH**: Has P,E,R,C... Wait, C is out—invalid.  
- **SERUM**: Has S,E,R,U,M—all new letters except E/R. Positions: R at 3, E at 2.  
  - Feedback told us E isn't at position 5, but position 2 might work; same for R not at 2—so position 3 for R is fresh.  

Other options: **ROUSE**? Has R,O,U,S,E. Positions: R(1), E(5)—but original feedback had E(-) at position 5, so E shouldn't be at end. Risk rechecking E at 5.  

Better to avoid reusing the position E was wrong in. Since E couldn't be at spot 5, placing it elsewhere—like **SERUM** (E at spot 2) or **BREAD** (R at 3, E at 4—E at 4 avoids position 5).  

**BREAD** might be strong:  
- B,R,E,A,D. But A is out! A was x in first guess → banned. So invalid.  

Revised: **PRIDE**? Has P,R,I,D,E.  
- Positions: R(2)—but R was tried at position 2 originally and was marked wrong (-), so placing R at position 2 again likely still wrong. Avoid reused positions for known letters.  

Best candidates:  
- **SPIRE**: R at 4, E at 5—but E at 5 was wrong before, so probably still wrong.  
- **RODEO**: Has R,O,D,E,O—E at position 4. Avoids reused spots: R at position 1 (new), E at position 4 (new). Also tests O and D.  

But **RODEO** has duplicate O—might reduce information. Prefer all distinct letters.  

**SOLVE**? Has S,O,L,V,E—E at position 5 → same issue. Avoid position 5 for E.  

**STRIDE**: S,T,R,I,D,E.  
- Positions: R(3), E(6)—wait, only 5 letters. **STRIP**? No E needed. Must include E.  

**SHIRE**? E at 5 again—no.  

Better: **MERCY**? But C is out—forbidden.  

**BERYL**? B,E,R,Y,L. Positions: R at 3, E at 2—both new slots. Letters: Tests B,Y,L.  

Key points:  
- Secret word has R and E, positions unknown but not index 2 for R and not index 5 for E.  
- Must exclude C,A,N.  

**BERYL** seems valid:  
- E at position 2 → originally untested for E (since E was at 5 before).  
- R at position 3 → originally R was at 2, so position 3 is new.  
- Tests B,Y,L—new letters.  

Alternative: **PERKY**—but K new, but E at position 4 avoids previous error slots.  

However, **BERYL** is a gemstone—valid English word. Solid choice to test R and E in new contexts while introducing fresh consonants.  

Decision: Next guess → **BERYL**.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.  
- **R(-)**: R is in the word, but not in position 2.  
- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.  
- **N(x)**: N is not in the word.  
- **E(-)**: E is in the word, but not in position 5.  

Key insights:  
1. **R** and **E** are confirmed present but misplaced.  
2. **C, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.  
3. R cannot be in position 2 (tried incorrectly), and E cannot be in position 5 (tried incorrectly).  

For the next guess:  
4. Must include **R** and **E** in *new positions*. Ideal positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is ruled out). For E: 1–4 (position 5 ruled out).  
5. Should introduce common unused letters like **S, T, L, B, P, D, M**, or vowels **O, I, U**, while avoiding C, A, N.  
6. Prioritize words with distinct letters to maximize information.  

A strong candidate is **BERYL**:  
- Tests **R** in position 3 (new position)  
- Tests **E** in position 2 (new position)  
- Introduces new letters: **B, Y, L** (common consonants and vowel-like Y)  
- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N) and reused positions for R/E.

- **TRIBE**: Has R (position 1), E (position 5). But position 5 was originally E(-), meaning E isn't at end—so placing E at position 5 again would likely still be wrong. R at position 1 is new—could be correct?  
- **PERCH**: Has P,E,R,C... Wait, C is out—invalid.  
- **SERUM**: Has S,E,R,U,M—all new letters except E/R. Positions: R at 3, E at 2.  
  - Feedback told us E isn't at position 5, but position 2 might work; same for R not at 2—so position 3 for R is fresh.  

Other options: **ROUSE**? Has R,O,U,S,E. Positions: R(1), E(5)—but original feedback had E(-) at position 5, so E shouldn't be at end. Risk rechecking E at 5.  

Better to avoid reusing the position E was wrong in. Since E couldn't be at spot 5, placing it elsewhere—like **SERUM** (E at spot 2) or **BREAD** (R at 3, E at 4—E at 4 avoids position 5).  

**BREAD** might be strong:  
- B,R,E,A,D. But A is out! A was x in first guess → banned. So invalid.  

Revised: **PRIDE**? Has P,R,I,D,E.  
- Positions: R(2)—but R was tried at position 2 originally and was marked wrong (-), so placing R at position 2 again likely still wrong. Avoid reused positions for known letters.  

Best candidates:  
- **SPIRE**: R at 4, E at 5—but E at 5 was wrong before, so probably still wrong.  
- **RODEO**: Has R,O,D,E,O—E at position 4. Avoids reused spots: R at position 1 (new), E at position 4 (new). Also tests O and D.  

But **RODEO** has duplicate O—might reduce information. Prefer all distinct letters.  

**SOLVE**? Has S,O,L,V,E—E at position 5 → same issue. Avoid position 5 for E.  

**STRIDE**: S,T,R,I,D,E.  
- Positions: R(3), E(6)—wait, only 5 letters. **STRIP**? No E needed. Must include E.  

**SHIRE**? E at 5 again—no.  

Better: **MERCY**? But C is out—forbidden.  

**BERYL**? B,E,R,Y,L. Positions: R at 3, E at 2—both new slots. Letters: Tests B,Y,L.  

Key points:  
- Secret word has R and E, positions unknown but not index 2 for R and not index 5 for E.  
- Must exclude C,A,N.  

**BERYL** seems valid:  
- E at position 2 → originally untested for E (since E was at 5 before).  
- R at position 3 → originally R was at 2, so position 3 is new.  
- Tests B,Y,L—new letters.  

Alternative: **PERKY**—but K new, but E at position 4 avoids previous error slots.  

However, **BERYL** is a gemstone—valid English word. Solid choice to test R and E in new contexts while introducing fresh consonants.  

Decision: Next guess → **BERYL**.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.  
- **R(-)**: R is in the word, but not in position 2.  
- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.  
- **N(x)**: N is not in the word.  
- **E(-)**: E is in the word, but not in position 5.  

Key insights:  
1. **R** and **E** are confirmed present but misplaced.  
2. **C, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.  
3. R cannot be in position 2 (tried incorrectly), and E cannot be in position 5 (tried incorrectly).  

For the next guess:  
4. Must include **R** and **E** in *new positions*. Ideal positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is ruled out). For E: 1–4 (position 5 ruled out).  
5. Should introduce common unused letters like **S, T, L, B, P, D, M**, or vowels **O, I, U**, while avoiding C, A, N.  
6. Prioritize words with distinct letters to maximize information.  

A strong candidate is **BERYL**:  
- Tests **R** in position 3 (new position)  
- Tests **E** in position 2 (new position)  
- Introduces new letters: **B, Y, L** (common consonants and vowel-like Y)  
- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N) and reused positions for R/E.  

This guess optimally narrows possibilities for the secret word.

Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a word that maximizes the amount of useful information I can get. This means selecting a word with common letters that might appear in many 5-letter English words.\n\nI recall that many Wordle players start with words that contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. Vowels are crucial because almost every English word has at least one vowel.

We have two sets of feedback:

First guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Second guess ""BERYL"": B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)

From the first guess, we know:
- R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- C, A, N are not in the word.

From the second guess:
- B(x): B is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 2 (since in BERYL, E was in position 2).
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since in BERYL, R was in position 3).
- Y(x): Y is not in the word.
- L(x): L is not in the word.

Now, combining the information:
- Letters confirmed in the word: R, E.
- Letters ruled out: C, A, N, B, Y, L.
- Position constraints:
  - R is not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from BERYL). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - E is not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from BERYL). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Because the word has 5 letters and we know only R and E must be included, we need to find a word that contains R and E, and three more letters that have not been ruled out.

Ruled out letters: A, B, C, L, N, Y. So available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.

We also know the secret word must be composed of only these available letters plus R and E.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4

Note that R and E might occupy the same position? But no, because each position can only have one letter. Also, they are two distinct letters unless the word has duplicates? But we don't know yet. But from the feedback, since we got two (probably) distinct letters, we assume they are different.

Now, we have to form a word that respects:
- Includes R and E at positions that are consistent with the exclusions.
- Does not include any ruled out letters.

Moreover, we must avoid the positions where they were misplaced.

Let me think of words that have R and E, and try to assign positions.

Possible positions:

Case 1: R at position 1.
Then E can be at 3 or 4 (not at 1 because same position, and not at 2 or 5).

So if R is at 1, then E at 3 or 4.

Similarly, if R at 4, then E at 1 or 3 (since E cannot be at 4 same as R? Wait, position 4 would have E and R? No, same position cannot have two letters. So when R is at 4, E cannot be at 4).

Similarly, R at 5: E at 1 or 3.

We also need to fill the other positions with letters that aren't excluded.

Since we have limited tries, we want a word that tests new common letters and further constraints.

Let's list possible words.

Common words with R and E:

Think of words where R is in position 1: e.g., ""RE..."". Then E must be at 3 or 4.

Examples:
- ""RESET"" has duplicate E, and S and T allowed? But E is at position 2 and 5? Not allowed: E cannot be at 5 and also we have E at 2 in second guess? But feedback: E(-) at position 2 meaning wrong position, so E might be at other positions but we know E cannot be at 2 in this word? Wait.

Actually, ""RESET"" has E at 2 and 5. Position 2 we know E is not correct there from second guess? Yes, but E can be at 5? Wait, no: first guess had E at 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at 5. Similarly, in second guess E at 2 wrong. So ""RESET"" would place E at 2 and 5, both forbidden positions? So invalid.

Another one: ""RIPER"" → has R at 1 and E at 4? And positions: 
Position 1: R (known to be acceptable location? but not confirmed if correct)
Position 2: I
Position 3: P
Position 4: E
Position 5: R? But now E is in position 4: which is allowed? Yes, because E was not ruled out for position 4. And R at position 4? Wait, ""RIPER"" has two R's? And R at position 5: but position 5 is allowed? R can be at 5? Since we only have position constraints for R: cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

But let's check: the word must have at least one R and one E. But ""RIPER"" has R at three positions? Not efficient but possible.

Moreover, in the first guess, we had E at 5 which was wrong, so the secret word might have E at 4. Similarly R at 4 or elsewhere.

But multiple R's? Possible? The rules don't forbid duplicate letters.

However, in feedback, if a letter is duplicated, it can complicate. For simplicity, maybe avoid duplicates for now.

But considering: if there is duplicate, the feedback might mark multiples. But for now, let's assume we prefer distinct letters if possible.

Another idea: use a word with R and E and test new common consonants.

For example, S, T, P, etc.

Possible word: ""ROGUE"". But O and U: not excluded. R at 1, E at 5? E is at 5? But first guess: E cannot be at 5. So not.

Word: ""RIFLE""? But F and L? But L is ruled out: from second guess, L(x), so L not in word. So no.

""RIDER"" - R at 1, D, then E at 4? R and D: but R at 5? Duplicate R.

Perhaps ""RISEN""? But S and N? N ruled out? First guess: N(x), so not allowed.

Since A, N, C, B, L, Y are out, available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.

Try R at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""R_ E _ _"". Like:

- ""RIPER"" but duplicate R? Or non-distinct.
- ""RIVER"": R at 1, I, V, E at 4? Wait, E at 4? But position: ""RIVER"" has positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? E is at position 4? Which is allowed? E can be at position 4. But R at 1 and 5: which R at 5 is possible? R can be at 1,4,5? So 5 is allowed? Maybe.

But R at 5: we have constraint R not at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

Similarly E at 4: not forbidden.

But I is new? V? But we need to test.

Another word: ""RISER"" - R at 1,5, S, E at 4? But S allowed. But similar to above.

But we might get less information due to duplicate.

Alternative: positions R at 4 and E at 1 or 3.

For example, R at position 4: then word ends with _ _ _ R ? 

But E must be at 1 or 3.

If E at 3: "" _ _ E R _""

Like ""PILER""? But L ruled out? L not allowed.

""TIMER"" - T, I, M, E, R? Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:M, 4:E, 5:R? 
But E is at position 4? Which is allowed? And R at position 5? Also allowed? T,I,M are not ruled out.

And E at position 4: from feedback, E cannot be at 2 or 5, so 4 or others? E can be at 4.

Similarly, R at 5? R cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

Also, T,I,M new letters.

Similarly, is ""TIMER"" valid? Yes, meaning a device that times.

But let's confirm constraints:
- R: position 5, not 2 or 3 -> allowed.
- E: position 4? But in the secret word, E must be placed at a new position? We haven't tested position 4 for E, so it's fine.

Similarly, R at position 5: we tried R at position 2 and 3? In CRANE, R at 2; in BERYL, R at 3. So position 5 is new and allowed.

Similarly E at 4: never tested, so possible.

But we have another possibility: R at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we skip position 3? 

For example: ""R _ _ E _"" 

With the middle three positions letters from allowed set.

Word: ""ROUGE""? E at 5? Not allowed.

""ROUSE"" E at 5? Not.

""RANGE"" G and E at 5? E at 5? Not allowed.

""RIPEN"" N ruled out? Not.

So perhaps ""RIPER"" but duplicate? Or ""RIVER"" which we considered.

But ""RIVER"" has E at position 4? And R at 5? And V and I? Available.

But let's compare: ""TIMER"" tests T,I,M,E,R with E at 4 and R at 5.

It avoids duplicate letters.

Similarly, ""TIMER"" uses common letters.

Another option: ""PORES"" P,O,R,E,S? R at position 3? But R cannot be at 3? Because second guess had R at 3 and it was wrong! So if R at position 3, it would be incorrect. Thus ""PORES"" has R at 3, which is forbidden? No: the constraint is that R cannot be at 3? Because in BERYL, R was at 3 and feedback was R(-), meaning R is not in position 3. So we cannot put R at position 3. Similarly, position 2 was wrong.

Therefore in ""TIMER"", R is at 5, which is new and allowed.

Similarly E at 4, also allowed.

Also, the word doesn't have any ruled out letters: T, I, M are possible.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TIMER"".

But let's see if there's a better one: another word might be ""HOMER""? But O and H? E at 4? R at 5? Also possible? But we get less common letters? Slightly less frequent.

""OFFER""? But duplicate F? And F? But E at 4? R at 5? O,F,F? Duplicate.

""TIMER"" seems solid.

So next guess: ""TIMER""

But to confirm:
- T: new
- I: new
- M: new
- E: now placed at position 4, which is new.
- R: at position 5, new.

Hoping to get ✓ on E or R, or identify correct letters.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, B, Y, L (from ""CRANE"" and ""BERYL"" feedback).
- **Confirmed present letters**: R and E.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from ""CRANE"" R(-)) or position 3 (from ""BERYL"" R(-)), so R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - E cannot be in position 2 (from ""BERYL"" E(-)) or position 5 (from ""CRANE"" E(-)), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E in new positions that respect the constraints (avoiding positions 2 and 3 for R, and positions 2 and 5 for E).
- Use only available letters (not excluded), such as D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.
- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information and avoid duplicates for clarity.

After evaluating options, ""TIMER"" fits well:
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- Tests new common consonants T, M, and vowel I.
- Avoids excluded letters and duplicate letters.

<guess>TIMER</guess>",TIMER,"We have two sets of feedback:

First guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Second guess ""BERYL"": B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)

From the first guess, we know:
- R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- C, A, N are not in the word.

From the second guess:
- B(x): B is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 2 (since in BERYL, E was in position 2).
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since in BERYL, R was in position 3).
- Y(x): Y is not in the word.
- L(x): L is not in the word.

Now, combining the information:
- Letters confirmed in the word: R, E.
- Letters ruled out: C, A, N, B, Y, L.
- Position constraints:
  - R is not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from BERYL). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - E is not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from BERYL). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Because the word has 5 letters and we know only R and E must be included, we need to find a word that contains R and E, and three more letters that have not been ruled out.

Ruled out letters: A, B, C, L, N, Y. So available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.

We also know the secret word must be composed of only these available letters plus R and E.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4

Note that R and E might occupy the same position? But no, because each position can only have one letter. Also, they are two distinct letters unless the word has duplicates? But we don't know yet. But from the feedback, since we got two (probably) distinct letters, we assume they are different.

Now, we have to form a word that respects:
- Includes R and E at positions that are consistent with the exclusions.
- Does not include any ruled out letters.

Moreover, we must avoid the positions where they were misplaced.

Let me think of words that have R and E, and try to assign positions.

Possible positions:

Case 1: R at position 1.
Then E can be at 3 or 4 (not at 1 because same position, and not at 2 or 5).

So if R is at 1, then E at 3 or 4.

Similarly, if R at 4, then E at 1 or 3 (since E cannot be at 4 same as R? Wait, position 4 would have E and R? No, same position cannot have two letters. So when R is at 4, E cannot be at 4).

Similarly, R at 5: E at 1 or 3.

We also need to fill the other positions with letters that aren't excluded.

Since we have limited tries, we want a word that tests new common letters and further constraints.

Let's list possible words.

Common words with R and E:

Think of words where R is in position 1: e.g., ""RE..."". Then E must be at 3 or 4.

Examples:
- ""RESET"" has duplicate E, and S and T allowed? But E is at position 2 and 5? Not allowed: E cannot be at 5 and also we have E at 2 in second guess? But feedback: E(-) at position 2 meaning wrong position, so E might be at other positions but we know E cannot be at 2 in this word? Wait.

Actually, ""RESET"" has E at 2 and 5. Position 2 we know E is not correct there from second guess? Yes, but E can be at 5? Wait, no: first guess had E at 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at 5. Similarly, in second guess E at 2 wrong. So ""RESET"" would place E at 2 and 5, both forbidden positions? So invalid.

Another one: ""RIPER"" → has R at 1 and E at 4? And positions: 
Position 1: R (known to be acceptable location? but not confirmed if correct)
Position 2: I
Position 3: P
Position 4: E
Position 5: R? But now E is in position 4: which is allowed? Yes, because E was not ruled out for position 4. And R at position 4? Wait, ""RIPER"" has two R's? And R at position 5: but position 5 is allowed? R can be at 5? Since we only have position constraints for R: cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

But let's check: the word must have at least one R and one E. But ""RIPER"" has R at three positions? Not efficient but possible.

Moreover, in the first guess, we had E at 5 which was wrong, so the secret word might have E at 4. Similarly R at 4 or elsewhere.

But multiple R's? Possible? The rules don't forbid duplicate letters.

However, in feedback, if a letter is duplicated, it can complicate. For simplicity, maybe avoid duplicates for now.

But considering: if there is duplicate, the feedback might mark multiples. But for now, let's assume we prefer distinct letters if possible.

Another idea: use a word with R and E and test new common consonants.

For example, S, T, P, etc.

Possible word: ""ROGUE"". But O and U: not excluded. R at 1, E at 5? E is at 5? But first guess: E cannot be at 5. So not.

Word: ""RIFLE""? But F and L? But L is ruled out: from second guess, L(x), so L not in word. So no.

""RIDER"" - R at 1, D, then E at 4? R and D: but R at 5? Duplicate R.

Perhaps ""RISEN""? But S and N? N ruled out? First guess: N(x), so not allowed.

Since A, N, C, B, L, Y are out, available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.

Try R at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""R_ E _ _"". Like:

- ""RIPER"" but duplicate R? Or non-distinct.
- ""RIVER"": R at 1, I, V, E at 4? Wait, E at 4? But position: ""RIVER"" has positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? E is at position 4? Which is allowed? E can be at position 4. But R at 1 and 5: which R at 5 is possible? R can be at 1,4,5? So 5 is allowed? Maybe.

But R at 5: we have constraint R not at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

Similarly E at 4: not forbidden.

But I is new? V? But we need to test.

Another word: ""RISER"" - R at 1,5, S, E at 4? But S allowed. But similar to above.

But we might get less information due to duplicate.

Alternative: positions R at 4 and E at 1 or 3.

For example, R at position 4: then word ends with _ _ _ R ? 

But E must be at 1 or 3.

If E at 3: "" _ _ E R _""

Like ""PILER""? But L ruled out? L not allowed.

""TIMER"" - T, I, M, E, R? Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:M, 4:E, 5:R? 
But E is at position 4? Which is allowed? And R at position 5? Also allowed? T,I,M are not ruled out.

And E at position 4: from feedback, E cannot be at 2 or 5, so 4 or others? E can be at 4.

Similarly, R at 5? R cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

Also, T,I,M new letters.

Similarly, is ""TIMER"" valid? Yes, meaning a device that times.

But let's confirm constraints:
- R: position 5, not 2 or 3 -> allowed.
- E: position 4? But in the secret word, E must be placed at a new position? We haven't tested position 4 for E, so it's fine.

Similarly, R at position 5: we tried R at position 2 and 3? In CRANE, R at 2; in BERYL, R at 3. So position 5 is new and allowed.

Similarly E at 4: never tested, so possible.

But we have another possibility: R at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we skip position 3? 

For example: ""R _ _ E _"" 

With the middle three positions letters from allowed set.

Word: ""ROUGE""? E at 5? Not allowed.

""ROUSE"" E at 5? Not.

""RANGE"" G and E at 5? E at 5? Not allowed.

""RIPEN"" N ruled out? Not.

So perhaps ""RIPER"" but duplicate? Or ""RIVER"" which we considered.

But ""RIVER"" has E at position 4? And R at 5? And V and I? Available.

But let's compare: ""TIMER"" tests T,I,M,E,R with E at 4 and R at 5.

It avoids duplicate letters.

Similarly, ""TIMER"" uses common letters.

Another option: ""PORES"" P,O,R,E,S? R at position 3? But R cannot be at 3? Because second guess had R at 3 and it was wrong! So if R at position 3, it would be incorrect. Thus ""PORES"" has R at 3, which is forbidden? No: the constraint is that R cannot be at 3? Because in BERYL, R was at 3 and feedback was R(-), meaning R is not in position 3. So we cannot put R at position 3. Similarly, position 2 was wrong.

Therefore in ""TIMER"", R is at 5, which is new and allowed.

Similarly E at 4, also allowed.

Also, the word doesn't have any ruled out letters: T, I, M are possible.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TIMER"".

But let's see if there's a better one: another word might be ""HOMER""? But O and H? E at 4? R at 5? Also possible? But we get less common letters? Slightly less frequent.

""OFFER""? But duplicate F? And F? But E at 4? R at 5? O,F,F? Duplicate.

""TIMER"" seems solid.

So next guess: ""TIMER""

But to confirm:
- T: new
- I: new
- M: new
- E: now placed at position 4, which is new.
- R: at position 5, new.

Hoping to get ✓ on E or R, or identify correct letters.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, B, Y, L (from ""CRANE"" and ""BERYL"" feedback).
- **Confirmed present letters**: R and E.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from ""CRANE"" R(-)) or position 3 (from ""BERYL"" R(-)), so R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - E cannot be in position 2 (from ""BERYL"" E(-)) or position 5 (from ""CRANE"" E(-)), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E in new positions that respect the constraints (avoiding positions 2 and 3 for R, and positions 2 and 5 for E).
- Use only available letters (not excluded), such as D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.
- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information and avoid duplicates for clarity.

After evaluating options, ""TIMER"" fits well:
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- Tests new common consonants T, M, and vowel I.
- Avoids excluded letters and duplicate letters.",Guess 3: TIMER -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,steer,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's start with my first guess. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a word that maximizes the amount of useful information I can get. This means selecting a word with common letters that might appear in many 5-letter English words.

I recall that many Wordle players start with words that contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. Vowels are crucial because almost every English word has at least one vowel. Among consonants, letters like R, S, T, L, and N appear frequently.

Considering this, a good starting word might be something like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another option is ""ROAST"". After thinking about it, ""CRANE"" seems solid because:

- It includes two vowels: A and E.
- Common consonants: C, R, N.

The vowel distribution seems good—E is the most common English letter, and A is also very frequent. Consonants like C, R, N are also quite common.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" could be another excellent choice due to the combination of S, L, A, T, E—all very common letters. But I decide to go with ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

So, I'll start by guessing ""CRANE"".I need to make a first guess with no prior information. A strong opener should use common letters to maximize feedback potential. Ideal starting words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).  

""CRANE"" is an effective choice because:  
- It covers three vowels (A, E) and useful consonants (C, R, N).  
- Tests positions for high-frequency letters to narrow down possibilities faster.  
- Often recommended in strategy guides for optimal information gain.  

This guess will reveal:  
- Which letters exist/missing via ✓/-/x symbols.  
- Positional accuracy for 5 distinct letters.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's analyze the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 

- C(x): Not in the word at all.  
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- A(x): Not in the word.  
- N(x): Not in the word.  
- E(-): E is in the word but wrong position.  

So, we know:  
1. **R** and **E** are definitely in the secret word, just not at positions 2 and 5 (since feedback shows wrong position).  
2. **C, A, N** are completely absent.  

Constraints for the next guess:  
- Must include R and E.  
- Exclude C, A, N.  
- Positions: R cannot be in spot 2 (tried there originally), E cannot be in spot 5.  

Since R and E exist, I should prioritize placing them in new positions. Possible slots for R: 1,3,4,5 (since position 2 was wrong). Possible slots for E: 1,2,3,4 (position 5 was wrong).  

Need a word with:  
- R in positions 1,3,4, or 5.  
- E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.  
- Avoid C,A,N entirely.  

Good candidate letters to test: Other common consonants like S,T,L,P,D,M since vowels A is out, so focus on remaining vowels (O,I,U) or consonants.  

Possible words:  
- Could try **RESET**? No—E repeated, and we risk duplicate letter issues. Better avoid duplicates for now.  
- **TRIBE**: Has R (position 1), E (position 5). But position 5 was originally E(-), meaning E isn't at end—so placing E at position 5 again would likely still be wrong. R at position 1 is new—could be correct?  
- **PERCH**: Has P,E,R,C... Wait, C is out—invalid.  
- **SERUM**: Has S,E,R,U,M—all new letters except E/R. Positions: R at 3, E at 2.  
  - Feedback told us E isn't at position 5, but position 2 might work; same for R not at 2—so position 3 for R is fresh.  

Other options: **ROUSE**? Has R,O,U,S,E. Positions: R(1), E(5)—but original feedback had E(-) at position 5, so E shouldn't be at end. Risk rechecking E at 5.  

Better to avoid reusing the position E was wrong in. Since E couldn't be at spot 5, placing it elsewhere—like **SERUM** (E at spot 2) or **BREAD** (R at 3, E at 4—E at 4 avoids position 5).  

**BREAD** might be strong:  
- B,R,E,A,D. But A is out! A was x in first guess → banned. So invalid.  

Revised: **PRIDE**? Has P,R,I,D,E.  
- Positions: R(2)—but R was tried at position 2 originally and was marked wrong (-), so placing R at position 2 again likely still wrong. Avoid reused positions for known letters.  

Best candidates:  
- **SPIRE**: R at 4, E at 5—but E at 5 was wrong before, so probably still wrong.  
- **RODEO**: Has R,O,D,E,O—E at position 4. Avoids reused spots: R at position 1 (new), E at position 4 (new). Also tests O and D.  

But **RODEO** has duplicate O—might reduce information. Prefer all distinct letters.  

**SOLVE**? Has S,O,L,V,E—E at position 5 → same issue. Avoid position 5 for E.  

**STRIDE**: S,T,R,I,D,E.  
- Positions: R(3), E(6)—wait, only 5 letters. **STRIP**? No E needed. Must include E.  

**SHIRE**? E at 5 again—no.  

Better: **MERCY**? But C is out—forbidden.  

**BERYL**? B,E,R,Y,L. Positions: R at 3, E at 2—both new slots. Letters: Tests B,Y,L.  

Key points:  
- Secret word has R and E, positions unknown but not index 2 for R and not index 5 for E.  
- Must exclude C,A,N.  

**BERYL** seems valid:  
- E at position 2 → originally untested for E (since E was at 5 before).  
- R at position 3 → originally R was at 2, so position 3 is new.  
- Tests B,Y,L—new letters.  

Alternative: **PERKY**—but K new, but E at position 4 avoids previous error slots.  

However, **BERYL** is a gemstone—valid English word. Solid choice to test R and E in new contexts while introducing fresh consonants.  

Decision: Next guess → **BERYL**.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.  
- **R(-)**: R is in the word, but not in position 2.  
- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.  
- **N(x)**: N is not in the word.  
- **E(-)**: E is in the word, but not in position 5.  

Key insights:  
1. **R** and **E** are confirmed present but misplaced.  
2. **C, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.  
3. R cannot be in position 2 (tried incorrectly), and E cannot be in position 5 (tried incorrectly).  

For the next guess:  
4. Must include **R** and **E** in *new positions*. Ideal positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is ruled out). For E: 1–4 (position 5 ruled out).  
5. Should introduce common unused letters like **S, T, L, B, P, D, M**, or vowels **O, I, U**, while avoiding C, A, N.  
6. Prioritize words with distinct letters to maximize information.  

A strong candidate is **BERYL**:  
- Tests **R** in position 3 (new position)  
- Tests **E** in position 2 (new position)  
- Introduces new letters: **B, Y, L** (common consonants and vowel-like Y)  
- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N) and reused positions for R/E.  

This guess optimally narrows possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>BERYL</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

First guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Second guess ""BERYL"": B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)

From the first guess, we know:
- R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- C, A, N are not in the word.

From the second guess:
- B(x): B is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 2 (since in BERYL, E was in position 2).
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since in BERYL, R was in position 3).
- Y(x): Y is not in the word.
- L(x): L is not in the word.

Now, combining the information:
- Letters confirmed in the word: R, E.
- Letters ruled out: C, A, N, B, Y, L.
- Position constraints:
  - R is not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from BERYL). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - E is not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from BERYL). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Because the word has 5 letters and we know only R and E must be included, we need to find a word that contains R and E, and three more letters that have not been ruled out.

Ruled out letters: A, B, C, L, N, Y. So available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.

We also know the secret word must be composed of only these available letters plus R and E.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4

Note that R and E might occupy the same position? But no, because each position can only have one letter. Also, they are two distinct letters unless the word has duplicates? But we don't know yet. But from the feedback, since we got two (probably) distinct letters, we assume they are different.

Now, we have to form a word that respects:
- Includes R and E at positions that are consistent with the exclusions.
- Does not include any ruled out letters.

Moreover, we must avoid the positions where they were misplaced.

Let me think of words that have R and E, and try to assign positions.

Possible positions:

Case 1: R at position 1.
Then E can be at 3 or 4 (not at 1 because same position, and not at 2 or 5).

So if R is at 1, then E at 3 or 4.

Similarly, if R at 4, then E at 1 or 3 (since E cannot be at 4 same as R? Wait, position 4 would have E and R? No, same position cannot have two letters. So when R is at 4, E cannot be at 4).

Similarly, R at 5: E at 1 or 3.

We also need to fill the other positions with letters that aren't excluded.

Since we have limited tries, we want a word that tests new common letters and further constraints.

Let's list possible words.

Common words with R and E:

Think of words where R is in position 1: e.g., ""RE..."". Then E must be at 3 or 4.

Examples:
- ""RESET"" has duplicate E, and S and T allowed? But E is at position 2 and 5? Not allowed: E cannot be at 5 and also we have E at 2 in second guess? But feedback: E(-) at position 2 meaning wrong position, so E might be at other positions but we know E cannot be at 2 in this word? Wait.

Actually, ""RESET"" has E at 2 and 5. Position 2 we know E is not correct there from second guess? Yes, but E can be at 5? Wait, no: first guess had E at 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at 5. Similarly, in second guess E at 2 wrong. So ""RESET"" would place E at 2 and 5, both forbidden positions? So invalid.

Another one: ""RIPER"" → has R at 1 and E at 4? And positions: 
Position 1: R (known to be acceptable location? but not confirmed if correct)
Position 2: I
Position 3: P
Position 4: E
Position 5: R? But now E is in position 4: which is allowed? Yes, because E was not ruled out for position 4. And R at position 4? Wait, ""RIPER"" has two R's? And R at position 5: but position 5 is allowed? R can be at 5? Since we only have position constraints for R: cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

But let's check: the word must have at least one R and one E. But ""RIPER"" has R at three positions? Not efficient but possible.

Moreover, in the first guess, we had E at 5 which was wrong, so the secret word might have E at 4. Similarly R at 4 or elsewhere.

But multiple R's? Possible? The rules don't forbid duplicate letters.

However, in feedback, if a letter is duplicated, it can complicate. For simplicity, maybe avoid duplicates for now.

But considering: if there is duplicate, the feedback might mark multiples. But for now, let's assume we prefer distinct letters if possible.

Another idea: use a word with R and E and test new common consonants.

For example, S, T, P, etc.

Possible word: ""ROGUE"". But O and U: not excluded. R at 1, E at 5? E is at 5? But first guess: E cannot be at 5. So not.

Word: ""RIFLE""? But F and L? But L is ruled out: from second guess, L(x), so L not in word. So no.

""RIDER"" - R at 1, D, then E at 4? R and D: but R at 5? Duplicate R.

Perhaps ""RISEN""? But S and N? N ruled out? First guess: N(x), so not allowed.

Since A, N, C, B, L, Y are out, available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.

Try R at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""R_ E _ _"". Like:

- ""RIPER"" but duplicate R? Or non-distinct.
- ""RIVER"": R at 1, I, V, E at 4? Wait, E at 4? But position: ""RIVER"" has positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? E is at position 4? Which is allowed? E can be at position 4. But R at 1 and 5: which R at 5 is possible? R can be at 1,4,5? So 5 is allowed? Maybe.

But R at 5: we have constraint R not at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

Similarly E at 4: not forbidden.

But I is new? V? But we need to test.

Another word: ""RISER"" - R at 1,5, S, E at 4? But S allowed. But similar to above.

But we might get less information due to duplicate.

Alternative: positions R at 4 and E at 1 or 3.

For example, R at position 4: then word ends with _ _ _ R ? 

But E must be at 1 or 3.

If E at 3: "" _ _ E R _""

Like ""PILER""? But L ruled out? L not allowed.

""TIMER"" - T, I, M, E, R? Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:M, 4:E, 5:R? 
But E is at position 4? Which is allowed? And R at position 5? Also allowed? T,I,M are not ruled out.

And E at position 4: from feedback, E cannot be at 2 or 5, so 4 or others? E can be at 4.

Similarly, R at 5? R cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

Also, T,I,M new letters.

Similarly, is ""TIMER"" valid? Yes, meaning a device that times.

But let's confirm constraints:
- R: position 5, not 2 or 3 -> allowed.
- E: position 4? But in the secret word, E must be placed at a new position? We haven't tested position 4 for E, so it's fine.

Similarly, R at position 5: we tried R at position 2 and 3? In CRANE, R at 2; in BERYL, R at 3. So position 5 is new and allowed.

Similarly E at 4: never tested, so possible.

But we have another possibility: R at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we skip position 3? 

For example: ""R _ _ E _"" 

With the middle three positions letters from allowed set.

Word: ""ROUGE""? E at 5? Not allowed.

""ROUSE"" E at 5? Not.

""RANGE"" G and E at 5? E at 5? Not allowed.

""RIPEN"" N ruled out? Not.

So perhaps ""RIPER"" but duplicate? Or ""RIVER"" which we considered.

But ""RIVER"" has E at position 4? And R at 5? And V and I? Available.

But let's compare: ""TIMER"" tests T,I,M,E,R with E at 4 and R at 5.

It avoids duplicate letters.

Similarly, ""TIMER"" uses common letters.

Another option: ""PORES"" P,O,R,E,S? R at position 3? But R cannot be at 3? Because second guess had R at 3 and it was wrong! So if R at position 3, it would be incorrect. Thus ""PORES"" has R at 3, which is forbidden? No: the constraint is that R cannot be at 3? Because in BERYL, R was at 3 and feedback was R(-), meaning R is not in position 3. So we cannot put R at position 3. Similarly, position 2 was wrong.

Therefore in ""TIMER"", R is at 5, which is new and allowed.

Similarly E at 4, also allowed.

Also, the word doesn't have any ruled out letters: T, I, M are possible.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TIMER"".

But let's see if there's a better one: another word might be ""HOMER""? But O and H? E at 4? R at 5? Also possible? But we get less common letters? Slightly less frequent.

""OFFER""? But duplicate F? And F? But E at 4? R at 5? O,F,F? Duplicate.

""TIMER"" seems solid.

So next guess: ""TIMER""

But to confirm:
- T: new
- I: new
- M: new
- E: now placed at position 4, which is new.
- R: at position 5, new.

Hoping to get ✓ on E or R, or identify correct letters.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, B, Y, L (from ""CRANE"" and ""BERYL"" feedback).
- **Confirmed present letters**: R and E.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from ""CRANE"" R(-)) or position 3 (from ""BERYL"" R(-)), so R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - E cannot be in position 2 (from ""BERYL"" E(-)) or position 5 (from ""CRANE"" E(-)), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E in new positions that respect the constraints (avoiding positions 2 and 3 for R, and positions 2 and 5 for E).
- Use only available letters (not excluded), such as D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.
- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information and avoid duplicates for clarity.

After evaluating options, ""TIMER"" fits well:
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- Tests new common consonants T, M, and vowel I.
- Avoids excluded letters and duplicate letters.

Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a word that maximizes the amount of useful information I can get. This means selecting a word with common letters that might appear in many 5-letter English words.\n\nI recall that many Wordle players start with words that contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. Vowels are crucial because almost every English word has at least one vowel. Among consonants, letters like R, S, T, L, and N appear frequently.\n\nConsidering this, a good starting word might be something like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another option is ""ROAST"". After thinking about it, ""CRANE"" seems solid because:\n\n- It includes two vowels: A and E.\n- Common consonants: C, R, N.\n\nThe vowel distribution seems good—E is the most common English letter, and A is also very frequent. Consonants like C, R, N are also quite common.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLATE"" could be another excellent choice due to the combination of S, L, A, T, E—all very common letters. But I decide to go with ""CRANE"" for this first guess.\n\nSo, I\'ll start by guessing ""CRANE"".I need to make a first guess with no prior information. A strong opener should use common letters to maximize feedback potential. Ideal starting words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).  \n\n""CRANE"" is an effective choice because:  \n- It covers three vowels (A, E) and useful consonants (C, R, N).  \n- Tests positions for high-frequency letters to narrow down possibilities faster.  \n- Often recommended in strategy guides for optimal information gain.  \n\nThis guess will reveal:  \n- Which letters exist/missing via ✓/-/x symbols.  \n- Positional accuracy for 5 distinct letters.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Alright, let\'s analyze the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": \n\n- C(x): Not in the word at all.  \n- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position.  \n- A(x): Not in the word.  \n- N(x): Not in the word.  \n- E(-): E is in the word but wrong position.  \n\nSo, we know:  \n1. **R** and **E** are definitely in the secret word, just not at positions 2 and 5 (since feedback shows wrong position).  \n2. **C, A, N** are completely absent.  \n\nConstraints for the next guess:  \n- Must include R and E.  \n- Exclude C, A, N.  \n- Positions: R cannot be in spot 2 (tried there originally), E cannot be in spot 5.  \n\nSince R and E exist, I should prioritize placing them in new positions. Possible slots for R: 1,3,4,5 (since position 2 was wrong). Possible slots for E: 1,2,3,4 (position 5 was wrong).  \n\nNeed a word with:  \n- R in positions 1,3,4, or 5.  \n- E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.  \n- Avoid C,A,N entirely.  \n\nGood candidate letters to test: Other common consonants like S,T,L,P,D,M since vowels A is out, so focus on remaining vowels (O,I,U) or consonants.  \n\nPossible words:  \n- Could try **RESET**? No—E repeated, and we risk duplicate letter issues. Better avoid duplicates for now.  \n- **TRIBE**: Has R (position 1), E (position 5). But position 5 was originally E(-), meaning E isn\'t at end—so placing E at position 5 again would likely still be wrong. R at position 1 is new—could be correct?  \n- **PERCH**: Has P,E,R,C... Wait, C is out—invalid.  \n- **SERUM**: Has S,E,R,U,M—all new letters except E/R. Positions: R at 3, E at 2.  \n  - Feedback told us E isn\'t at position 5, but position 2 might work; same for R not at 2—so position 3 for R is fresh.  \n\nOther options: **ROUSE**? Has R,O,U,S,E. Positions: R(1), E(5)—but original feedback had E(-) at position 5, so E shouldn\'t be at end. Risk rechecking E at 5.  \n\nBetter to avoid reusing the position E was wrong in. Since E couldn\'t be at spot 5, placing it elsewhere—like **SERUM** (E at spot 2) or **BREAD** (R at 3, E at 4—E at 4 avoids position 5).  \n\n**BREAD** might be strong:  \n- B,R,E,A,D. But A is out! A was x in first guess → banned. So invalid.  \n\nRevised: **PRIDE**? Has P,R,I,D,E.  \n- Positions: R(2)—but R was tried at position 2 originally and was marked wrong (-), so placing R at position 2 again likely still wrong. Avoid reused positions for known letters.  \n\nBest candidates:  \n- **SPIRE**: R at 4, E at 5—but E at 5 was wrong before, so probably still wrong.  \n- **RODEO**: Has R,O,D,E,O—E at position 4. Avoids reused spots: R at position 1 (new), E at position 4 (new). Also tests O and D.  \n\nBut **RODEO** has duplicate O—might reduce information. Prefer all distinct letters.  \n\n**SOLVE**? Has S,O,L,V,E—E at position 5 → same issue. Avoid position 5 for E.  \n\n**STRIDE**: S,T,R,I,D,E.  \n- Positions: R(3), E(6)—wait, only 5 letters. **STRIP**? No E needed. Must include E.  \n\n**SHIRE**? E at 5 again—no.  \n\nBetter: **MERCY**? But C is out—forbidden.  \n\n**BERYL**? B,E,R,Y,L. Positions: R at 3, E at 2—both new slots. Letters: Tests B,Y,L.  \n\nKey points:  \n- Secret word has R and E, positions unknown but not index 2 for R and not index 5 for E.  \n- Must exclude C,A,N.  \n\n**BERYL** seems valid:  \n- E at position 2 → originally untested for E (since E was at 5 before).  \n- R at position 3 → originally R was at 2, so position 3 is new.  \n- Tests B,Y,L—new letters.  \n\nAlternative: **PERKY**—but K new, but E at position 4 avoids previous error slots.  \n\nHowever, **BERYL** is a gemstone—valid English word. Solid choice to test R and E in new contexts while introducing fresh consonants.  \n\nDecision: Next guess → **BERYL**.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  \n- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.  \n- **R(-)**: R is in the word, but not in position 2.  \n- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.  \n- **N(x)**: N is not in the word.  \n- **E(-)**: E is in the word, but not in position 5.  \n\nKey insights:  \n1. **R** and **E** are confirmed present but misplaced.  \n2. **C, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.  \n3. R cannot be in position 2 (tried incorrectly), and E cannot be in position 5 (tried incorrectly).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n4. Must include **R** and **E** in *new positions*. Ideal positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is ruled out). For E: 1–4 (position 5 ruled out).  \n5. Should introduce common unused letters like **S, T, L, B, P, D, M**, or vowels **O, I, U**, while avoiding C, A, N.  \n6. Prioritize words with distinct letters to maximize information.  \n\nA strong candidate is **BERYL**:  \n- Tests **R** in position 3 (new position)  \n- Tests **E** in position 2 (new position)  \n- Introduces new letters: **B, Y, L** (common consonants and vowel-like Y)  \n- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N) and reused positions for R/E.  \n\nThis guess optimally narrows possibilities for the secret word.\n\n<guess>BERYL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nFirst guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nSecond guess ""BERYL"": B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)\n\nFrom the first guess, we know:\n- R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.\n- C, A, N are not in the word.\n\nFrom the second guess:\n- B(x): B is not in the word.\n- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 2 (since in BERYL, E was in position 2).\n- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since in BERYL, R was in position 3).\n- Y(x): Y is not in the word.\n- L(x): L is not in the word.\n\nNow, combining the information:\n- Letters confirmed in the word: R, E.\n- Letters ruled out: C, A, N, B, Y, L.\n- Position constraints:\n  - R is not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from BERYL). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n  - E is not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from BERYL). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBecause the word has 5 letters and we know only R and E must be included, we need to find a word that contains R and E, and three more letters that have not been ruled out.\n\nRuled out letters: A, B, C, L, N, Y. So available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.\n\nWe also know the secret word must be composed of only these available letters plus R and E.\n\nPossible positions for R: 1, 4, 5\nPossible positions for E: 1, 3, 4\n\nNote that R and E might occupy the same position? But no, because each position can only have one letter. Also, they are two distinct letters unless the word has duplicates? But we don\'t know yet. But from the feedback, since we got two (probably) distinct letters, we assume they are different.\n\nNow, we have to form a word that respects:\n- Includes R and E at positions that are consistent with the exclusions.\n- Does not include any ruled out letters.\n\nMoreover, we must avoid the positions where they were misplaced.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and E, and try to assign positions.\n\nPossible positions:\n\nCase 1: R at position 1.\nThen E can be at 3 or 4 (not at 1 because same position, and not at 2 or 5).\n\nSo if R is at 1, then E at 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, if R at 4, then E at 1 or 3 (since E cannot be at 4 same as R? Wait, position 4 would have E and R? No, same position cannot have two letters. So when R is at 4, E cannot be at 4).\n\nSimilarly, R at 5: E at 1 or 3.\n\nWe also need to fill the other positions with letters that aren\'t excluded.\n\nSince we have limited tries, we want a word that tests new common letters and further constraints.\n\nLet\'s list possible words.\n\nCommon words with R and E:\n\nThink of words where R is in position 1: e.g., ""RE..."". Then E must be at 3 or 4.\n\nExamples:\n- ""RESET"" has duplicate E, and S and T allowed? But E is at position 2 and 5? Not allowed: E cannot be at 5 and also we have E at 2 in second guess? But feedback: E(-) at position 2 meaning wrong position, so E might be at other positions but we know E cannot be at 2 in this word? Wait.\n\nActually, ""RESET"" has E at 2 and 5. Position 2 we know E is not correct there from second guess? Yes, but E can be at 5? Wait, no: first guess had E at 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at 5. Similarly, in second guess E at 2 wrong. So ""RESET"" would place E at 2 and 5, both forbidden positions? So invalid.\n\nAnother one: ""RIPER"" → has R at 1 and E at 4? And positions: \nPosition 1: R (known to be acceptable location? but not confirmed if correct)\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: P\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R? But now E is in position 4: which is allowed? Yes, because E was not ruled out for position 4. And R at position 4? Wait, ""RIPER"" has two R\'s? And R at position 5: but position 5 is allowed? R can be at 5? Since we only have position constraints for R: cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.\n\nBut let\'s check: the word must have at least one R and one E. But ""RIPER"" has R at three positions? Not efficient but possible.\n\nMoreover, in the first guess, we had E at 5 which was wrong, so the secret word might have E at 4. Similarly R at 4 or elsewhere.\n\nBut multiple R\'s? Possible? The rules don\'t forbid duplicate letters.\n\nHowever, in feedback, if a letter is duplicated, it can complicate. For simplicity, maybe avoid duplicates for now.\n\nBut considering: if there is duplicate, the feedback might mark multiples. But for now, let\'s assume we prefer distinct letters if possible.\n\nAnother idea: use a word with R and E and test new common consonants.\n\nFor example, S, T, P, etc.\n\nPossible word: ""ROGUE"". But O and U: not excluded. R at 1, E at 5? E is at 5? But first guess: E cannot be at 5. So not.\n\nWord: ""RIFLE""? But F and L? But L is ruled out: from second guess, L(x), so L not in word. So no.\n\n""RIDER"" - R at 1, D, then E at 4? R and D: but R at 5? Duplicate R.\n\nPerhaps ""RISEN""? But S and N? N ruled out? First guess: N(x), so not allowed.\n\nSince A, N, C, B, L, Y are out, available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.\n\nTry R at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""R_ E _ _"". Like:\n\n- ""RIPER"" but duplicate R? Or non-distinct.\n- ""RIVER"": R at 1, I, V, E at 4? Wait, E at 4? But position: ""RIVER"" has positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? E is at position 4? Which is allowed? E can be at position 4. But R at 1 and 5: which R at 5 is possible? R can be at 1,4,5? So 5 is allowed? Maybe.\n\nBut R at 5: we have constraint R not at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.\n\nSimilarly E at 4: not forbidden.\n\nBut I is new? V? But we need to test.\n\nAnother word: ""RISER"" - R at 1,5, S, E at 4? But S allowed. But similar to above.\n\nBut we might get less information due to duplicate.\n\nAlternative: positions R at 4 and E at 1 or 3.\n\nFor example, R at position 4: then word ends with _ _ _ R ? \n\nBut E must be at 1 or 3.\n\nIf E at 3: "" _ _ E R _""\n\nLike ""PILER""? But L ruled out? L not allowed.\n\n""TIMER"" - T, I, M, E, R? Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:M, 4:E, 5:R? \nBut E is at position 4? Which is allowed? And R at position 5? Also allowed? T,I,M are not ruled out.\n\nAnd E at position 4: from feedback, E cannot be at 2 or 5, so 4 or others? E can be at 4.\n\nSimilarly, R at 5? R cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.\n\nAlso, T,I,M new letters.\n\nSimilarly, is ""TIMER"" valid? Yes, meaning a device that times.\n\nBut let\'s confirm constraints:\n- R: position 5, not 2 or 3 -> allowed.\n- E: position 4? But in the secret word, E must be placed at a new position? We haven\'t tested position 4 for E, so it\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, R at position 5: we tried R at position 2 and 3? In CRANE, R at 2; in BERYL, R at 3. So position 5 is new and allowed.\n\nSimilarly E at 4: never tested, so possible.\n\nBut we have another possibility: R at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we skip position 3? \n\nFor example: ""R _ _ E _"" \n\nWith the middle three positions letters from allowed set.\n\nWord: ""ROUGE""? E at 5? Not allowed.\n\n""ROUSE"" E at 5? Not.\n\n""RANGE"" G and E at 5? E at 5? Not allowed.\n\n""RIPEN"" N ruled out? Not.\n\nSo perhaps ""RIPER"" but duplicate? Or ""RIVER"" which we considered.\n\nBut ""RIVER"" has E at position 4? And R at 5? And V and I? Available.\n\nBut let\'s compare: ""TIMER"" tests T,I,M,E,R with E at 4 and R at 5.\n\nIt avoids duplicate letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""TIMER"" uses common letters.\n\nAnother option: ""PORES"" P,O,R,E,S? R at position 3? But R cannot be at 3? Because second guess had R at 3 and it was wrong! So if R at position 3, it would be incorrect. Thus ""PORES"" has R at 3, which is forbidden? No: the constraint is that R cannot be at 3? Because in BERYL, R was at 3 and feedback was R(-), meaning R is not in position 3. So we cannot put R at position 3. Similarly, position 2 was wrong.\n\nTherefore in ""TIMER"", R is at 5, which is new and allowed.\n\nSimilarly E at 4, also allowed.\n\nAlso, the word doesn\'t have any ruled out letters: T, I, M are possible.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""TIMER"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a better one: another word might be ""HOMER""? But O and H? E at 4? R at 5? Also possible? But we get less common letters? Slightly less frequent.\n\n""OFFER""? But duplicate F? And F? But E at 4? R at 5? O,F,F? Duplicate.\n\n""TIMER"" seems solid.\n\nSo next guess: ""TIMER""\n\nBut to confirm:\n- T: new\n- I: new\n- M: new\n- E: now placed at position 4, which is new.\n- R: at position 5, new.\n\nHoping to get ✓ on E or R, or identify correct letters.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, B, Y, L (from ""CRANE"" and ""BERYL"" feedback).\n- **Confirmed present letters**: R and E.\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - R cannot be in position 2 (from ""CRANE"" R(-)) or position 3 (from ""BERYL"" R(-)), so R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n  - E cannot be in position 2 (from ""BERYL"" E(-)) or position 5 (from ""CRANE"" E(-)), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and E in new positions that respect the constraints (avoiding positions 2 and 3 for R, and positions 2 and 5 for E).\n- Use only available letters (not excluded), such as D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.\n- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information and avoid duplicates for clarity.\n\nAfter evaluating options, ""TIMER"" fits well:\n- R is in position 5 (allowed).\n- E is in position 4 (allowed).\n- Tests new common consonants T, M, and vowel I.\n- Avoids excluded letters and duplicate letters.\n\n<guess>TIMER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)\nGuess 3: TIMER -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  - C, A, N are absent.
  - R is present but not in position 2.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: BERYL -> B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)
  - B, Y, L are absent.
  - E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked wrong).
  - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong).

Guess 3: TIMER -> T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)
  - T is present but not in position 1.
  - I and M are absent.
  - E is correct at position 4 (so the 4th letter is E).
  - R is correct at position 5 (so the 5th letter is R).

So, we know:
- The word has E in the 4th position and R in the 5th position. So the word ends with ""ER"".
- Additionally, we have T present in the word, but not in position 1 (since in TIMER it was in position 1 and marked as wrong position).
- We have R and E confirmed from the start, and now we know their exact positions: 4 and 5.

Also, from the first two guesses, we know that R is not in position 2 or 3, and E is not in position 2 or 5 (but now we know E is in 4, so that's consistent). Also, R is now fixed at 5.

Now, the word structure: _ _ _ E R

We know T is in the word but not in position 1. So T must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, we have a list of absent letters: C, A, N, B, Y, L, I, M.

So absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y.

Therefore, available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and possibly others, but we know T is present.

Since T is present and must be in position 2 or 3, we can consider words of the form:
- If T is in position 2: _ T _ E R
- If T is in position 3: _ _ T E R

We also need to fill the first and the third (or second) position with available letters, and the word must be a valid English word.

Moreover, we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on the 4th guess), so we want to maximize information.

But we also have two positions to figure out: positions 1 and either 2 or 3 (depending on where T is). Actually, we don't know which of the two positions T is in.

We can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 and tests a common letter for position 1 and 3, or vice versa.

Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.

But note: we have only two unknown positions? Actually, no: the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know 4 and 5 (E and R). So we need positions 1,2,3.

But we know T is in the word and must be in either 2 or 3. So one of position 2 or 3 is T, and the other is another letter, and position 1 is another letter.

So we have three positions to determine, but with the constraint that T is in one of 2 or 3.

We can think of two cases:

Case 1: T in position 2 -> word: _ T _ E R
Case 2: T in position 3 -> word: _ _ T E R

We need to find words that fit one of these patterns and use only available letters.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and we know T is used.

Common letters left: S, T, O, P, D, etc.

We can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 and tests a vowel for position 1 and a consonant for 3, or vice versa.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, for Case 1: _ T _ E R
Possible words:
- After T, the third letter must be a vowel or consonant that can form a word. Common words: 
  - ""OTTER"" -> but T is repeated? And O in position 1. But we have T in position 2 and 3? But we need position 3 to be a letter, then E R. ""OTTER"" has two T's? Then it would be O T T E R. But position 3 is T? Then we have T in position 2 and 3? But we know T is only one? Not necessarily, but we don't know. However, in feedback, for TIMER, T was present but wrong position, so it could be that there is only one T? But it might be duplicated? We don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

So without duplicates: 
- ""UTTER"" -> again duplicate T? U T T E R -> same.
- ""STYER"" -> but Y is absent? Y is ruled out (from BERYL: Y(x)).
- ""STOER""? Not a word? 
- ""STOER"" might not be common. 
- ""ATER""? But A is absent.

Better: ""OTTER"" is a word, but duplicate T.

""AFTER""? But A is absent.

""OUTER""? O U T E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but this is for Case 2? No, for Case 1 we need T in position 2.

For Case 1: _ T _ E R
- Position 1: any available letter except absent ones.
- Position 3: any available letter.

Examples:
- ""STYER"" invalid because Y absent.
- ""PTER"" is not 5 letters? We need 5 letters.

""OTTER"": O T T E R -> but position 3 is T, so it has two T's. But we don't know if T is duplicated? It could be.

But let's see: in TIMER, we had T in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one T in the word, but it could be more. However, the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. So we have to consider.

But for now, let's avoid if possible.

Another word: ""UTTER"" same issue.

""AFTER"" A absent.

""ENTER"" E in position 1? But we have E already at 4, and E might be duplicated? But in first guess, E was present but not at 5, and now we have E at 4. But we don't know if there is another E? The feedback doesn't show duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter is duplicated, the feedback might be tricky. For example, if the word has one E and you guess two, one might be marked as absent.

But in our case, we haven't guessed duplicates yet.

Perhaps we can try a word without duplicates for Case 1.

What about ""OTHER""? O T H E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:T, 3:H, 4:E, 5:R -> this fits Case 1: T in position 2.

And H is available? H not ruled out.

Similarly, ""OTTER"" has duplicate T, but ""OTHER"" does not.

""OTHER"" is a valid word.

Now, for Case 2: _ _ T E R
Examples:
- ""CATER"" but C and A absent.
- ""DATER"" A absent.
- ""HATER"" A absent.
- ""LATER"" A and L absent? L is absent.
- ""MATER"" M absent? M is absent from TIMER: M(x).
- ""PATER"" P A T E R -> A absent.
- ""RATER"" R at position 1? But we have R at 5, and R might be duplicated? But we don't know. Also, in ""RATER"", R is at 1 and 5? But position 1: R, then A absent? A is absent.

Another: ""WATER"" A absent.

""SOBER"" but B absent? B is absent from BERYL: B(x).

""COVER"" C absent.

""POKER"" P O K E R -> K is available? K not ruled out.

""POKER"" is a word: positions 1:P, 2:O, 3:K, 4:E, 5:R.

Similarly, ""POWER"" O W E R -> but then position 3: W? ""POWER"" is P O W E R.

""TOWER"" T O W E R -> but T is in position 1? But we are in Case 2, which is T in position 3? ""TOWER"" has T in position 1, not 3.

For Case 2, we need T in position 3: so _ _ T E R.

So ""POKER"" has K? And P and O.

""POSER"" P O S E R -> S is available.

""POSER"" is a word: P O S E R.

Similarly, ""DOPER"" D O P E R -> but P and D? ""DOPER"" might not be common? But valid.

""DOSER"" D O S E R.

But we also have T to place? In Case 2, T is in position 3, so the word must have T at 3.

So for Case 2: _ _ T E R

Examples:
- ""BITER"" B absent.
- ""CITER"" C absent.
- ""DITER"" not a word.
- ""FIGHTER"" too long.
- ""HITTER"" H I T T E R -> duplicate T? And I absent? I is absent from TIMER: I(x).
- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but that's 5 letters? L I T R E, positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4 and R at 5? Here R is at 4 and E at 5? Not matching.

We need the pattern to have E at 4 and R at 5, so the last two are fixed as ER.

So for Case 2: positions: 1,2,3=T,4=E,5=R? No: position 3 is T, then 4=E, 5=R.

So the word is: ? ? T E R

Examples:
- ""MITER"" M absent? M(x) from TIMER.
- ""NITER"" N absent.
- ""PETER"" P E T E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but E at 2 and 4? But we have E at 4, and E might be duplicated? But in this case, position 2 is E? But we know E cannot be at position 2 from BERYL feedback? BERYL had E at 2 and it was wrong position, so E is not at 2. So ""PETER"" would have E at 2, which is forbidden.

Similarly, ""RUTER"" R U T E R -> R at 1 and 5? But R at 1: we don't know if R is duplicated? But we have R at 5 fixed. Also, U is available.

But ""RUTER"" is not a common word? Router is 6 letters.

""SUPER"" S U P E R -> but no T? We need T at position 3.

""SUPER"" is S U P E R, so position 3 is P, not T.

We need T at 3.

""UTTER"" U T T E R -> but T at 2 and 3? So for Case 2, we need T at 3, but ""UTTER"" has T at 2 and 3? So position 3 is T, but also position 2 is T? So it fits the pattern? The pattern is _ _ T E R, so position 3 is T, but position 2 can be anything? In ""UTTER"", position 1:U, 2:T, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R. So position 3 is T, which is what we want for Case 2? But position 2 is also T? So it has duplicate T.

But the pattern for Case 2 is: position 3 must be T, but position 2 can be T or not? It can be, but we don't know.

Similarly, ""OTTER"" for Case 2: O T T E R -> position 3 is T? Yes, but position 2 is T? So again duplicate.

But we can consider.

Another word: ""AFTER"" A absent.

""ENTER"" E at 1? But E cannot be at 1? We don't know, but E is at 4, and we don't know about duplicates. But in ""ENTER"", E at 1 and 4? Position 1: E, which might be possible? But we have no feedback about E at position 1. However, in the first guess, E was at 5 and wrong, and second guess E at 2 and wrong, but position 1 has not been tested for E. So it could be.

But ""ENTER"" has E at 1 and 4? And T at 3? So for Case 2: _ _ T E R, ""ENTER"" would be E N T E R -> but N is absent? N(x) from CRANE.

So not.

""INTER"" I absent.

""OUTER"" O U T E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> this fits Case 2: T at position 3.

And O and U are available.

""OUTER"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""POKER"" is P O K E R, but no T? Position 3 is K, not T.

For Case 2, we need T at 3.

So ""OUTER"" is a good candidate.

Now, back to our guess: we need to choose a word that can help distinguish between the cases.

But we also know that T must be in position 2 or 3.

We can guess a word that has T in position 2, for example, to test Case 1.

Or one with T in position 3 for Case 2.

But we can also guess a word that has T in one of them and tests the other positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that covers common possibilities.

But we have two main candidates: ""OTHER"" for Case 1 (T in 2) and ""OUTER"" for Case 2 (T in 3).

If we guess ""OTHER"", it tests:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: T (which we suspect might be correct if Case 1)
- Position 3: H

And we know position 4 and 5 are E and R.

Similarly, if we guess ""OUTER"", it tests:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: T (for Case 2)

But we don't know which case.

We could guess a word that has T in position 2 and uses a common letter for position 1 and 3, or vice versa.

Another idea: guess a word that has T in position 3 and tests position 1 and 2 with common letters.

But we also have T present, so we must include T.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

First, for Case 1: _ T _ E R
Possible words with available letters (no absent letters):
- ""OTHER"" (O, T, H, E, R)
- ""UTTER"" (U, T, T, E, R) - duplicate T
- ""OTTER"" (O, T, T, E, R) - duplicate T
- ""STVER"" not a word.
- ""STYER"" invalid Y.
- ""PTER"" not 5 letters.
- ""DATER"" A absent.
- So ""OTHER"" is the main one without duplicates.

For Case 2: _ _ T E R
- ""OUTER"" (O, U, T, E, R)
- ""PETER"" (P, E, T, E, R) - but E at 2, which is forbidden (from BERYL, E not at 2)
- ""MITER"" M absent.
- ""NITER"" N absent.
- ""RUTER"" not common, but R U T E R? Might be accepted? But R at 1 and 5? Duplicate R? And U.
- ""SUTER"" not common.
- ""CITER"" C absent.
- ""HITTER"" H I T T E R -> I absent and duplicate T.
- ""JITTER"" too long.
- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but R at 4 and E at 5? Not matching our pattern (we need E at 4, R at 5). ""LITRE"" is L-I-T-R-E, so positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need 4:E and 5:R, so not.
- ""METER"" M absent and E at 2? Forbidden.
- ""POKER"" no T at 3.
- ""POSER"" no T.
- So ""OUTER"" is a good candidate for Case 2.

Also, ""AFTER"" is invalid due to A.

So we have two main possibilities: ""OTHER"" and ""OUTER"".

But ""OTHER"" has T in position 2, and ""OUTER"" has T in position 3.

We can choose one to test.

Since we have T present and we know it's not in 1, it must be in 2 or 3.

If we guess ""OTHER"":
- If T is in position 2, then we might get T(✓) at position 2, and then we know the word is _ T _ E R, and we have O and H to check.
- If T is not in position 2, then we know T must be in position 3 (since it's present), and then we get T(-) for position 2, meaning T is in the word but not at 2, so it must be at 3.

Similarly, if we guess ""OUTER"":
- If T is in position 3, we get T(✓) at 3.
- If not, then T must be in position 2.

But in ""OUTER"", position 3 is T, so if T is in position 3, it will be correct.

But we don't know.

Also, by guessing ""OTHER"", we test O and H.

Similarly, ""OUTER"" tests O and U.

Common letters: O is common, H and U are also common.

But we have no information about O, H, U.

We can choose one.

Another word: what about ""POWER""? But ""POWER"" is P O W E R, so positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But no T? We must include T because it's present. So we cannot guess a word without T.

Similarly, we must include T in the guess.

So we have to have T in the word.

Therefore, between ""OTHER"" and ""OUTER"", both are valid.

Let's see which one gives more information.

If we guess ""OTHER"":
- If we get T(✓) at position 2, then the word is _ T H E R, and we only need position 1. And from feedback, we'll know about O and H.
- If we get T(-) at position 2, then T is not at 2, so it must be at 3, and then the word is _ _ T E R, and we know O and H are not in the word? Not necessarily, but we get feedback on O and H.

Similarly for ""OUTER"".

But we have only two cases, so after this guess, we might solve it.

Since we have E and R fixed, and T must be in 2 or 3, we can also consider guessing a word that has T in position 3 and common letters for 1 and 2.

For example, ""OUTER"" does that.

But let's choose ""OTHER"" as a guess.

Or perhaps ""SHOER"" but S H O E R? But no T? Must include T.

Another word: ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But we know T cannot be in position 1 (from TIMER feedback: T(-) at position 1, so T not at 1). So ""TOWER"" has T at 1, which is forbidden. So invalid.

Similarly, we cannot have T in position 1.

So back to ""OTHER"" or ""OUTER"".

I think ""OTHER"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with ""OTHER"".

Then, based on feedback, we can determine.

But let's see the response format.

We need to output the guess.

So <guess>OTHER</guess>

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""OTHER"", then we get all correct? But we don't know.

If not, we get information.

But we have to make a guess.

Another possibility: the word could be ""UTTER"" or ""OTTER"", but let's try to avoid duplicates first.

So I think ""OTHER"" is fine.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
     - C, A, N are absent from the word.
     - R is present but not in position 2.
     - E is present but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (BERYL)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)
     - B, Y, L are absent.
     - E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked wrong).
     - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong).
   - **Guess 3 (TIMER)**: T(-), I(x), M(x), E(✓), R(✓)
     - T is present but not in position 1.
     - I and M are absent.
     - E is correct at position 4 (so the 4th letter is E).
     - R is correct at position 5 (so the 5th letter is R).

2. **Key Insights:**
   - The word ends with ""ER"" (positions 4 and 5 are fixed as E and R).
   - T is present but cannot be in position 1 (from TIMER feedback). Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, T must be in position 2 or 3.
   - Absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y (from all feedback).
   - Available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and others not ruled out.
   - Word structure: `_ _ _ E R` (positions 1, 2, 3 unknown, with T in either 2 or 3).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - Must include T (since it's confirmed present) and test its position (2 or 3).
   - Avoid absent letters and reuse E and R in their correct positions (4 and 5) to confirm consistency.
   - Test new common letters (e.g., O, H, U) to gather more information.
   - Prioritize words without duplicates for clearer feedback.
   - Two main candidate patterns:
     - **Case 1**: T in position 2 → `_ T _ E R` (e.g., ""OTHER"").
     - **Case 2**: T in position 3 → `_ _ T E R` (e.g., ""OUTER"").
   - ""OTHER"" is chosen because:
     - It tests T in position 2 (helping resolve the position ambiguity).
     - It introduces new common letters: O (position 1) and H (position 3), which are not ruled out.
     - If T is in position 2, feedback may confirm it (✓) or indicate it's misplaced (-), narrowing T to position 3.
     - Feedback on O and H will help identify the remaining letters.

4. **Expected Outcomes:**
   - If T is in position 2: Feedback may show T(✓) and provide info on O and H.
   - If T is not in position 2: Feedback will show T(-), confirming T must be in position 3, and provide info on O and H for other positions.
   - This guess maximizes information with common letters and avoids duplicates.

<guess>OTHER</guess>",OTHER,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  - C, A, N are absent.
  - R is present but not in position 2.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: BERYL -> B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)
  - B, Y, L are absent.
  - E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked wrong).
  - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong).

Guess 3: TIMER -> T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)
  - T is present but not in position 1.
  - I and M are absent.
  - E is correct at position 4 (so the 4th letter is E).
  - R is correct at position 5 (so the 5th letter is R).

So, we know:
- The word has E in the 4th position and R in the 5th position. So the word ends with ""ER"".
- Additionally, we have T present in the word, but not in position 1 (since in TIMER it was in position 1 and marked as wrong position).
- We have R and E confirmed from the start, and now we know their exact positions: 4 and 5.

Also, from the first two guesses, we know that R is not in position 2 or 3, and E is not in position 2 or 5 (but now we know E is in 4, so that's consistent). Also, R is now fixed at 5.

Now, the word structure: _ _ _ E R

We know T is in the word but not in position 1. So T must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, we have a list of absent letters: C, A, N, B, Y, L, I, M.

So absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y.

Therefore, available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and possibly others, but we know T is present.

Since T is present and must be in position 2 or 3, we can consider words of the form:
- If T is in position 2: _ T _ E R
- If T is in position 3: _ _ T E R

We also need to fill the first and the third (or second) position with available letters, and the word must be a valid English word.

Moreover, we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on the 4th guess), so we want to maximize information.

But we also have two positions to figure out: positions 1 and either 2 or 3 (depending on where T is). Actually, we don't know which of the two positions T is in.

We can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 and tests a common letter for position 1 and 3, or vice versa.

Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.

But note: we have only two unknown positions? Actually, no: the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know 4 and 5 (E and R). So we need positions 1,2,3.

But we know T is in the word and must be in either 2 or 3. So one of position 2 or 3 is T, and the other is another letter, and position 1 is another letter.

So we have three positions to determine, but with the constraint that T is in one of 2 or 3.

We can think of two cases:

Case 1: T in position 2 -> word: _ T _ E R
Case 2: T in position 3 -> word: _ _ T E R

We need to find words that fit one of these patterns and use only available letters.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and we know T is used.

Common letters left: S, T, O, P, D, etc.

We can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 and tests a vowel for position 1 and a consonant for 3, or vice versa.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, for Case 1: _ T _ E R
Possible words:
- After T, the third letter must be a vowel or consonant that can form a word. Common words: 
  - ""OTTER"" -> but T is repeated? And O in position 1. But we have T in position 2 and 3? But we need position 3 to be a letter, then E R. ""OTTER"" has two T's? Then it would be O T T E R. But position 3 is T? Then we have T in position 2 and 3? But we know T is only one? Not necessarily, but we don't know. However, in feedback, for TIMER, T was present but wrong position, so it could be that there is only one T? But it might be duplicated? We don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

So without duplicates: 
- ""UTTER"" -> again duplicate T? U T T E R -> same.
- ""STYER"" -> but Y is absent? Y is ruled out (from BERYL: Y(x)).
- ""STOER""? Not a word? 
- ""STOER"" might not be common. 
- ""ATER""? But A is absent.

Better: ""OTTER"" is a word, but duplicate T.

""AFTER""? But A is absent.

""OUTER""? O U T E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but this is for Case 2? No, for Case 1 we need T in position 2.

For Case 1: _ T _ E R
- Position 1: any available letter except absent ones.
- Position 3: any available letter.

Examples:
- ""STYER"" invalid because Y absent.
- ""PTER"" is not 5 letters? We need 5 letters.

""OTTER"": O T T E R -> but position 3 is T, so it has two T's. But we don't know if T is duplicated? It could be.

But let's see: in TIMER, we had T in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one T in the word, but it could be more. However, the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. So we have to consider.

But for now, let's avoid if possible.

Another word: ""UTTER"" same issue.

""AFTER"" A absent.

""ENTER"" E in position 1? But we have E already at 4, and E might be duplicated? But in first guess, E was present but not at 5, and now we have E at 4. But we don't know if there is another E? The feedback doesn't show duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter is duplicated, the feedback might be tricky. For example, if the word has one E and you guess two, one might be marked as absent.

But in our case, we haven't guessed duplicates yet.

Perhaps we can try a word without duplicates for Case 1.

What about ""OTHER""? O T H E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:T, 3:H, 4:E, 5:R -> this fits Case 1: T in position 2.

And H is available? H not ruled out.

Similarly, ""OTTER"" has duplicate T, but ""OTHER"" does not.

""OTHER"" is a valid word.

Now, for Case 2: _ _ T E R
Examples:
- ""CATER"" but C and A absent.
- ""DATER"" A absent.
- ""HATER"" A absent.
- ""LATER"" A and L absent? L is absent.
- ""MATER"" M absent? M is absent from TIMER: M(x).
- ""PATER"" P A T E R -> A absent.
- ""RATER"" R at position 1? But we have R at 5, and R might be duplicated? But we don't know. Also, in ""RATER"", R is at 1 and 5? But position 1: R, then A absent? A is absent.

Another: ""WATER"" A absent.

""SOBER"" but B absent? B is absent from BERYL: B(x).

""COVER"" C absent.

""POKER"" P O K E R -> K is available? K not ruled out.

""POKER"" is a word: positions 1:P, 2:O, 3:K, 4:E, 5:R.

Similarly, ""POWER"" O W E R -> but then position 3: W? ""POWER"" is P O W E R.

""TOWER"" T O W E R -> but T is in position 1? But we are in Case 2, which is T in position 3? ""TOWER"" has T in position 1, not 3.

For Case 2, we need T in position 3: so _ _ T E R.

So ""POKER"" has K? And P and O.

""POSER"" P O S E R -> S is available.

""POSER"" is a word: P O S E R.

Similarly, ""DOPER"" D O P E R -> but P and D? ""DOPER"" might not be common? But valid.

""DOSER"" D O S E R.

But we also have T to place? In Case 2, T is in position 3, so the word must have T at 3.

So for Case 2: _ _ T E R

Examples:
- ""BITER"" B absent.
- ""CITER"" C absent.
- ""DITER"" not a word.
- ""FIGHTER"" too long.
- ""HITTER"" H I T T E R -> duplicate T? And I absent? I is absent from TIMER: I(x).
- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but that's 5 letters? L I T R E, positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4 and R at 5? Here R is at 4 and E at 5? Not matching.

We need the pattern to have E at 4 and R at 5, so the last two are fixed as ER.

So for Case 2: positions: 1,2,3=T,4=E,5=R? No: position 3 is T, then 4=E, 5=R.

So the word is: ? ? T E R

Examples:
- ""MITER"" M absent? M(x) from TIMER.
- ""NITER"" N absent.
- ""PETER"" P E T E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but E at 2 and 4? But we have E at 4, and E might be duplicated? But in this case, position 2 is E? But we know E cannot be at position 2 from BERYL feedback? BERYL had E at 2 and it was wrong position, so E is not at 2. So ""PETER"" would have E at 2, which is forbidden.

Similarly, ""RUTER"" R U T E R -> R at 1 and 5? But R at 1: we don't know if R is duplicated? But we have R at 5 fixed. Also, U is available.

But ""RUTER"" is not a common word? Router is 6 letters.

""SUPER"" S U P E R -> but no T? We need T at position 3.

""SUPER"" is S U P E R, so position 3 is P, not T.

We need T at 3.

""UTTER"" U T T E R -> but T at 2 and 3? So for Case 2, we need T at 3, but ""UTTER"" has T at 2 and 3? So position 3 is T, but also position 2 is T? So it fits the pattern? The pattern is _ _ T E R, so position 3 is T, but position 2 can be anything? In ""UTTER"", position 1:U, 2:T, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R. So position 3 is T, which is what we want for Case 2? But position 2 is also T? So it has duplicate T.

But the pattern for Case 2 is: position 3 must be T, but position 2 can be T or not? It can be, but we don't know.

Similarly, ""OTTER"" for Case 2: O T T E R -> position 3 is T? Yes, but position 2 is T? So again duplicate.

But we can consider.

Another word: ""AFTER"" A absent.

""ENTER"" E at 1? But E cannot be at 1? We don't know, but E is at 4, and we don't know about duplicates. But in ""ENTER"", E at 1 and 4? Position 1: E, which might be possible? But we have no feedback about E at position 1. However, in the first guess, E was at 5 and wrong, and second guess E at 2 and wrong, but position 1 has not been tested for E. So it could be.

But ""ENTER"" has E at 1 and 4? And T at 3? So for Case 2: _ _ T E R, ""ENTER"" would be E N T E R -> but N is absent? N(x) from CRANE.

So not.

""INTER"" I absent.

""OUTER"" O U T E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> this fits Case 2: T at position 3.

And O and U are available.

""OUTER"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""POKER"" is P O K E R, but no T? Position 3 is K, not T.

For Case 2, we need T at 3.

So ""OUTER"" is a good candidate.

Now, back to our guess: we need to choose a word that can help distinguish between the cases.

But we also know that T must be in position 2 or 3.

We can guess a word that has T in position 2, for example, to test Case 1.

Or one with T in position 3 for Case 2.

But we can also guess a word that has T in one of them and tests the other positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that covers common possibilities.

But we have two main candidates: ""OTHER"" for Case 1 (T in 2) and ""OUTER"" for Case 2 (T in 3).

If we guess ""OTHER"", it tests:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: T (which we suspect might be correct if Case 1)
- Position 3: H

And we know position 4 and 5 are E and R.

Similarly, if we guess ""OUTER"", it tests:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: T (for Case 2)

But we don't know which case.

We could guess a word that has T in position 2 and uses a common letter for position 1 and 3, or vice versa.

Another idea: guess a word that has T in position 3 and tests position 1 and 2 with common letters.

But we also have T present, so we must include T.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

First, for Case 1: _ T _ E R
Possible words with available letters (no absent letters):
- ""OTHER"" (O, T, H, E, R)
- ""UTTER"" (U, T, T, E, R) - duplicate T
- ""OTTER"" (O, T, T, E, R) - duplicate T
- ""STVER"" not a word.
- ""STYER"" invalid Y.
- ""PTER"" not 5 letters.
- ""DATER"" A absent.
- So ""OTHER"" is the main one without duplicates.

For Case 2: _ _ T E R
- ""OUTER"" (O, U, T, E, R)
- ""PETER"" (P, E, T, E, R) - but E at 2, which is forbidden (from BERYL, E not at 2)
- ""MITER"" M absent.
- ""NITER"" N absent.
- ""RUTER"" not common, but R U T E R? Might be accepted? But R at 1 and 5? Duplicate R? And U.
- ""SUTER"" not common.
- ""CITER"" C absent.
- ""HITTER"" H I T T E R -> I absent and duplicate T.
- ""JITTER"" too long.
- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but R at 4 and E at 5? Not matching our pattern (we need E at 4, R at 5). ""LITRE"" is L-I-T-R-E, so positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need 4:E and 5:R, so not.
- ""METER"" M absent and E at 2? Forbidden.
- ""POKER"" no T at 3.
- ""POSER"" no T.
- So ""OUTER"" is a good candidate for Case 2.

Also, ""AFTER"" is invalid due to A.

So we have two main possibilities: ""OTHER"" and ""OUTER"".

But ""OTHER"" has T in position 2, and ""OUTER"" has T in position 3.

We can choose one to test.

Since we have T present and we know it's not in 1, it must be in 2 or 3.

If we guess ""OTHER"":
- If T is in position 2, then we might get T(✓) at position 2, and then we know the word is _ T _ E R, and we have O and H to check.
- If T is not in position 2, then we know T must be in position 3 (since it's present), and then we get T(-) for position 2, meaning T is in the word but not at 2, so it must be at 3.

Similarly, if we guess ""OUTER"":
- If T is in position 3, we get T(✓) at 3.
- If not, then T must be in position 2.

But in ""OUTER"", position 3 is T, so if T is in position 3, it will be correct.

But we don't know.

Also, by guessing ""OTHER"", we test O and H.

Similarly, ""OUTER"" tests O and U.

Common letters: O is common, H and U are also common.

But we have no information about O, H, U.

We can choose one.

Another word: what about ""POWER""? But ""POWER"" is P O W E R, so positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But no T? We must include T because it's present. So we cannot guess a word without T.

Similarly, we must include T in the guess.

So we have to have T in the word.

Therefore, between ""OTHER"" and ""OUTER"", both are valid.

Let's see which one gives more information.

If we guess ""OTHER"":
- If we get T(✓) at position 2, then the word is _ T H E R, and we only need position 1. And from feedback, we'll know about O and H.
- If we get T(-) at position 2, then T is not at 2, so it must be at 3, and then the word is _ _ T E R, and we know O and H are not in the word? Not necessarily, but we get feedback on O and H.

Similarly for ""OUTER"".

But we have only two cases, so after this guess, we might solve it.

Since we have E and R fixed, and T must be in 2 or 3, we can also consider guessing a word that has T in position 3 and common letters for 1 and 2.

For example, ""OUTER"" does that.

But let's choose ""OTHER"" as a guess.

Or perhaps ""SHOER"" but S H O E R? But no T? Must include T.

Another word: ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But we know T cannot be in position 1 (from TIMER feedback: T(-) at position 1, so T not at 1). So ""TOWER"" has T at 1, which is forbidden. So invalid.

Similarly, we cannot have T in position 1.

So back to ""OTHER"" or ""OUTER"".

I think ""OTHER"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with ""OTHER"".

Then, based on feedback, we can determine.

But let's see the response format.

We need to output the guess.

So <guess>OTHER</guess>

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""OTHER"", then we get all correct? But we don't know.

If not, we get information.

But we have to make a guess.

Another possibility: the word could be ""UTTER"" or ""OTTER"", but let's try to avoid duplicates first.

So I think ""OTHER"" is fine.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
     - C, A, N are absent from the word.
     - R is present but not in position 2.
     - E is present but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (BERYL)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)
     - B, Y, L are absent.
     - E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked wrong).
     - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong).
   - **Guess 3 (TIMER)**: T(-), I(x), M(x), E(✓), R(✓)
     - T is present but not in position 1.
     - I and M are absent.
     - E is correct at position 4 (so the 4th letter is E).
     - R is correct at position 5 (so the 5th letter is R).

2. **Key Insights:**
   - The word ends with ""ER"" (positions 4 and 5 are fixed as E and R).
   - T is present but cannot be in position 1 (from TIMER feedback). Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, T must be in position 2 or 3.
   - Absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y (from all feedback).
   - Available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and others not ruled out.
   - Word structure: `_ _ _ E R` (positions 1, 2, 3 unknown, with T in either 2 or 3).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - Must include T (since it's confirmed present) and test its position (2 or 3).
   - Avoid absent letters and reuse E and R in their correct positions (4 and 5) to confirm consistency.
   - Test new common letters (e.g., O, H, U) to gather more information.
   - Prioritize words without duplicates for clearer feedback.
   - Two main candidate patterns:
     - **Case 1**: T in position 2 → `_ T _ E R` (e.g., ""OTHER"").
     - **Case 2**: T in position 3 → `_ _ T E R` (e.g., ""OUTER"").
   - ""OTHER"" is chosen because:
     - It tests T in position 2 (helping resolve the position ambiguity).
     - It introduces new common letters: O (position 1) and H (position 3), which are not ruled out.
     - If T is in position 2, feedback may confirm it (✓) or indicate it's misplaced (-), narrowing T to position 3.
     - Feedback on O and H will help identify the remaining letters.

4. **Expected Outcomes:**
   - If T is in position 2: Feedback may show T(✓) and provide info on O and H.
   - If T is not in position 2: Feedback will show T(-), confirming T must be in position 3, and provide info on O and H for other positions.
   - This guess maximizes information with common letters and avoids duplicates.",Guess 4: OTHER -> FEEDBACK: O(x) T(✓) H(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's start with my first guess. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a word that maximizes the amount of useful information I can get. This means selecting a word with common letters that might appear in many 5-letter English words.

I recall that many Wordle players start with words that contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. Vowels are crucial because almost every English word has at least one vowel. Among consonants, letters like R, S, T, L, and N appear frequently.

Considering this, a good starting word might be something like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another option is ""ROAST"". After thinking about it, ""CRANE"" seems solid because:

- It includes two vowels: A and E.
- Common consonants: C, R, N.

The vowel distribution seems good—E is the most common English letter, and A is also very frequent. Consonants like C, R, N are also quite common.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" could be another excellent choice due to the combination of S, L, A, T, E—all very common letters. But I decide to go with ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

So, I'll start by guessing ""CRANE"".I need to make a first guess with no prior information. A strong opener should use common letters to maximize feedback potential. Ideal starting words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).  

""CRANE"" is an effective choice because:  
- It covers three vowels (A, E) and useful consonants (C, R, N).  
- Tests positions for high-frequency letters to narrow down possibilities faster.  
- Often recommended in strategy guides for optimal information gain.  

This guess will reveal:  
- Which letters exist/missing via ✓/-/x symbols.  
- Positional accuracy for 5 distinct letters.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's analyze the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 

- C(x): Not in the word at all.  
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- A(x): Not in the word.  
- N(x): Not in the word.  
- E(-): E is in the word but wrong position.  

So, we know:  
1. **R** and **E** are definitely in the secret word, just not at positions 2 and 5 (since feedback shows wrong position).  
2. **C, A, N** are completely absent.  

Constraints for the next guess:  
- Must include R and E.  
- Exclude C, A, N.  
- Positions: R cannot be in spot 2 (tried there originally), E cannot be in spot 5.  

Since R and E exist, I should prioritize placing them in new positions. Possible slots for R: 1,3,4,5 (since position 2 was wrong). Possible slots for E: 1,2,3,4 (position 5 was wrong).  

Need a word with:  
- R in positions 1,3,4, or 5.  
- E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.  
- Avoid C,A,N entirely.  

Good candidate letters to test: Other common consonants like S,T,L,P,D,M since vowels A is out, so focus on remaining vowels (O,I,U) or consonants.  

Possible words:  
- Could try **RESET**? No—E repeated, and we risk duplicate letter issues. Better avoid duplicates for now.  
- **TRIBE**: Has R (position 1), E (position 5). But position 5 was originally E(-), meaning E isn't at end—so placing E at position 5 again would likely still be wrong. R at position 1 is new—could be correct?  
- **PERCH**: Has P,E,R,C... Wait, C is out—invalid.  
- **SERUM**: Has S,E,R,U,M—all new letters except E/R. Positions: R at 3, E at 2.  
  - Feedback told us E isn't at position 5, but position 2 might work; same for R not at 2—so position 3 for R is fresh.  

Other options: **ROUSE**? Has R,O,U,S,E. Positions: R(1), E(5)—but original feedback had E(-) at position 5, so E shouldn't be at end. Risk rechecking E at 5.  

Better to avoid reusing the position E was wrong in. Since E couldn't be at spot 5, placing it elsewhere—like **SERUM** (E at spot 2) or **BREAD** (R at 3, E at 4—E at 4 avoids position 5).  

**BREAD** might be strong:  
- B,R,E,A,D. But A is out! A was x in first guess → banned. So invalid.  

Revised: **PRIDE**? Has P,R,I,D,E.  
- Positions: R(2)—but R was tried at position 2 originally and was marked wrong (-), so placing R at position 2 again likely still wrong. Avoid reused positions for known letters.  

Best candidates:  
- **SPIRE**: R at 4, E at 5—but E at 5 was wrong before, so probably still wrong.  
- **RODEO**: Has R,O,D,E,O—E at position 4. Avoids reused spots: R at position 1 (new), E at position 4 (new). Also tests O and D.  

But **RODEO** has duplicate O—might reduce information. Prefer all distinct letters.  

**SOLVE**? Has S,O,L,V,E—E at position 5 → same issue. Avoid position 5 for E.  

**STRIDE**: S,T,R,I,D,E.  
- Positions: R(3), E(6)—wait, only 5 letters. **STRIP**? No E needed. Must include E.  

**SHIRE**? E at 5 again—no.  

Better: **MERCY**? But C is out—forbidden.  

**BERYL**? B,E,R,Y,L. Positions: R at 3, E at 2—both new slots. Letters: Tests B,Y,L.  

Key points:  
- Secret word has R and E, positions unknown but not index 2 for R and not index 5 for E.  
- Must exclude C,A,N.  

**BERYL** seems valid:  
- E at position 2 → originally untested for E (since E was at 5 before).  
- R at position 3 → originally R was at 2, so position 3 is new.  
- Tests B,Y,L—new letters.  

Alternative: **PERKY**—but K new, but E at position 4 avoids previous error slots.  

However, **BERYL** is a gemstone—valid English word. Solid choice to test R and E in new contexts while introducing fresh consonants.  

Decision: Next guess → **BERYL**.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.  
- **R(-)**: R is in the word, but not in position 2.  
- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.  
- **N(x)**: N is not in the word.  
- **E(-)**: E is in the word, but not in position 5.  

Key insights:  
1. **R** and **E** are confirmed present but misplaced.  
2. **C, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.  
3. R cannot be in position 2 (tried incorrectly), and E cannot be in position 5 (tried incorrectly).  

For the next guess:  
4. Must include **R** and **E** in *new positions*. Ideal positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is ruled out). For E: 1–4 (position 5 ruled out).  
5. Should introduce common unused letters like **S, T, L, B, P, D, M**, or vowels **O, I, U**, while avoiding C, A, N.  
6. Prioritize words with distinct letters to maximize information.  

A strong candidate is **BERYL**:  
- Tests **R** in position 3 (new position)  
- Tests **E** in position 2 (new position)  
- Introduces new letters: **B, Y, L** (common consonants and vowel-like Y)  
- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N) and reused positions for R/E.  

This guess optimally narrows possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>BERYL</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

First guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Second guess ""BERYL"": B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)

From the first guess, we know:
- R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- C, A, N are not in the word.

From the second guess:
- B(x): B is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 2 (since in BERYL, E was in position 2).
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since in BERYL, R was in position 3).
- Y(x): Y is not in the word.
- L(x): L is not in the word.

Now, combining the information:
- Letters confirmed in the word: R, E.
- Letters ruled out: C, A, N, B, Y, L.
- Position constraints:
  - R is not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from BERYL). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - E is not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from BERYL). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Because the word has 5 letters and we know only R and E must be included, we need to find a word that contains R and E, and three more letters that have not been ruled out.

Ruled out letters: A, B, C, L, N, Y. So available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.

We also know the secret word must be composed of only these available letters plus R and E.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4

Note that R and E might occupy the same position? But no, because each position can only have one letter. Also, they are two distinct letters unless the word has duplicates? But we don't know yet. But from the feedback, since we got two (probably) distinct letters, we assume they are different.

Now, we have to form a word that respects:
- Includes R and E at positions that are consistent with the exclusions.
- Does not include any ruled out letters.

Moreover, we must avoid the positions where they were misplaced.

Let me think of words that have R and E, and try to assign positions.

Possible positions:

Case 1: R at position 1.
Then E can be at 3 or 4 (not at 1 because same position, and not at 2 or 5).

So if R is at 1, then E at 3 or 4.

Similarly, if R at 4, then E at 1 or 3 (since E cannot be at 4 same as R? Wait, position 4 would have E and R? No, same position cannot have two letters. So when R is at 4, E cannot be at 4).

Similarly, R at 5: E at 1 or 3.

We also need to fill the other positions with letters that aren't excluded.

Since we have limited tries, we want a word that tests new common letters and further constraints.

Let's list possible words.

Common words with R and E:

Think of words where R is in position 1: e.g., ""RE..."". Then E must be at 3 or 4.

Examples:
- ""RESET"" has duplicate E, and S and T allowed? But E is at position 2 and 5? Not allowed: E cannot be at 5 and also we have E at 2 in second guess? But feedback: E(-) at position 2 meaning wrong position, so E might be at other positions but we know E cannot be at 2 in this word? Wait.

Actually, ""RESET"" has E at 2 and 5. Position 2 we know E is not correct there from second guess? Yes, but E can be at 5? Wait, no: first guess had E at 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at 5. Similarly, in second guess E at 2 wrong. So ""RESET"" would place E at 2 and 5, both forbidden positions? So invalid.

Another one: ""RIPER"" → has R at 1 and E at 4? And positions: 
Position 1: R (known to be acceptable location? but not confirmed if correct)
Position 2: I
Position 3: P
Position 4: E
Position 5: R? But now E is in position 4: which is allowed? Yes, because E was not ruled out for position 4. And R at position 4? Wait, ""RIPER"" has two R's? And R at position 5: but position 5 is allowed? R can be at 5? Since we only have position constraints for R: cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

But let's check: the word must have at least one R and one E. But ""RIPER"" has R at three positions? Not efficient but possible.

Moreover, in the first guess, we had E at 5 which was wrong, so the secret word might have E at 4. Similarly R at 4 or elsewhere.

But multiple R's? Possible? The rules don't forbid duplicate letters.

However, in feedback, if a letter is duplicated, it can complicate. For simplicity, maybe avoid duplicates for now.

But considering: if there is duplicate, the feedback might mark multiples. But for now, let's assume we prefer distinct letters if possible.

Another idea: use a word with R and E and test new common consonants.

For example, S, T, P, etc.

Possible word: ""ROGUE"". But O and U: not excluded. R at 1, E at 5? E is at 5? But first guess: E cannot be at 5. So not.

Word: ""RIFLE""? But F and L? But L is ruled out: from second guess, L(x), so L not in word. So no.

""RIDER"" - R at 1, D, then E at 4? R and D: but R at 5? Duplicate R.

Perhaps ""RISEN""? But S and N? N ruled out? First guess: N(x), so not allowed.

Since A, N, C, B, L, Y are out, available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.

Try R at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""R_ E _ _"". Like:

- ""RIPER"" but duplicate R? Or non-distinct.
- ""RIVER"": R at 1, I, V, E at 4? Wait, E at 4? But position: ""RIVER"" has positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? E is at position 4? Which is allowed? E can be at position 4. But R at 1 and 5: which R at 5 is possible? R can be at 1,4,5? So 5 is allowed? Maybe.

But R at 5: we have constraint R not at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

Similarly E at 4: not forbidden.

But I is new? V? But we need to test.

Another word: ""RISER"" - R at 1,5, S, E at 4? But S allowed. But similar to above.

But we might get less information due to duplicate.

Alternative: positions R at 4 and E at 1 or 3.

For example, R at position 4: then word ends with _ _ _ R ? 

But E must be at 1 or 3.

If E at 3: "" _ _ E R _""

Like ""PILER""? But L ruled out? L not allowed.

""TIMER"" - T, I, M, E, R? Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:M, 4:E, 5:R? 
But E is at position 4? Which is allowed? And R at position 5? Also allowed? T,I,M are not ruled out.

And E at position 4: from feedback, E cannot be at 2 or 5, so 4 or others? E can be at 4.

Similarly, R at 5? R cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

Also, T,I,M new letters.

Similarly, is ""TIMER"" valid? Yes, meaning a device that times.

But let's confirm constraints:
- R: position 5, not 2 or 3 -> allowed.
- E: position 4? But in the secret word, E must be placed at a new position? We haven't tested position 4 for E, so it's fine.

Similarly, R at position 5: we tried R at position 2 and 3? In CRANE, R at 2; in BERYL, R at 3. So position 5 is new and allowed.

Similarly E at 4: never tested, so possible.

But we have another possibility: R at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we skip position 3? 

For example: ""R _ _ E _"" 

With the middle three positions letters from allowed set.

Word: ""ROUGE""? E at 5? Not allowed.

""ROUSE"" E at 5? Not.

""RANGE"" G and E at 5? E at 5? Not allowed.

""RIPEN"" N ruled out? Not.

So perhaps ""RIPER"" but duplicate? Or ""RIVER"" which we considered.

But ""RIVER"" has E at position 4? And R at 5? And V and I? Available.

But let's compare: ""TIMER"" tests T,I,M,E,R with E at 4 and R at 5.

It avoids duplicate letters.

Similarly, ""TIMER"" uses common letters.

Another option: ""PORES"" P,O,R,E,S? R at position 3? But R cannot be at 3? Because second guess had R at 3 and it was wrong! So if R at position 3, it would be incorrect. Thus ""PORES"" has R at 3, which is forbidden? No: the constraint is that R cannot be at 3? Because in BERYL, R was at 3 and feedback was R(-), meaning R is not in position 3. So we cannot put R at position 3. Similarly, position 2 was wrong.

Therefore in ""TIMER"", R is at 5, which is new and allowed.

Similarly E at 4, also allowed.

Also, the word doesn't have any ruled out letters: T, I, M are possible.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TIMER"".

But let's see if there's a better one: another word might be ""HOMER""? But O and H? E at 4? R at 5? Also possible? But we get less common letters? Slightly less frequent.

""OFFER""? But duplicate F? And F? But E at 4? R at 5? O,F,F? Duplicate.

""TIMER"" seems solid.

So next guess: ""TIMER""

But to confirm:
- T: new
- I: new
- M: new
- E: now placed at position 4, which is new.
- R: at position 5, new.

Hoping to get ✓ on E or R, or identify correct letters.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, B, Y, L (from ""CRANE"" and ""BERYL"" feedback).
- **Confirmed present letters**: R and E.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from ""CRANE"" R(-)) or position 3 (from ""BERYL"" R(-)), so R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - E cannot be in position 2 (from ""BERYL"" E(-)) or position 5 (from ""CRANE"" E(-)), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E in new positions that respect the constraints (avoiding positions 2 and 3 for R, and positions 2 and 5 for E).
- Use only available letters (not excluded), such as D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.
- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information and avoid duplicates for clarity.

After evaluating options, ""TIMER"" fits well:
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- Tests new common consonants T, M, and vowel I.
- Avoids excluded letters and duplicate letters.

<guess>TIMER</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)
Guess 3: TIMER -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  - C, A, N are absent.
  - R is present but not in position 2.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: BERYL -> B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)
  - B, Y, L are absent.
  - E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked wrong).
  - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong).

Guess 3: TIMER -> T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)
  - T is present but not in position 1.
  - I and M are absent.
  - E is correct at position 4 (so the 4th letter is E).
  - R is correct at position 5 (so the 5th letter is R).

So, we know:
- The word has E in the 4th position and R in the 5th position. So the word ends with ""ER"".
- Additionally, we have T present in the word, but not in position 1 (since in TIMER it was in position 1 and marked as wrong position).
- We have R and E confirmed from the start, and now we know their exact positions: 4 and 5.

Also, from the first two guesses, we know that R is not in position 2 or 3, and E is not in position 2 or 5 (but now we know E is in 4, so that's consistent). Also, R is now fixed at 5.

Now, the word structure: _ _ _ E R

We know T is in the word but not in position 1. So T must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, we have a list of absent letters: C, A, N, B, Y, L, I, M.

So absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y.

Therefore, available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and possibly others, but we know T is present.

Since T is present and must be in position 2 or 3, we can consider words of the form:
- If T is in position 2: _ T _ E R
- If T is in position 3: _ _ T E R

We also need to fill the first and the third (or second) position with available letters, and the word must be a valid English word.

Moreover, we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on the 4th guess), so we want to maximize information.

But we also have two positions to figure out: positions 1 and either 2 or 3 (depending on where T is). Actually, we don't know which of the two positions T is in.

We can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 and tests a common letter for position 1 and 3, or vice versa.

Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.

But note: we have only two unknown positions? Actually, no: the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know 4 and 5 (E and R). So we need positions 1,2,3.

But we know T is in the word and must be in either 2 or 3. So one of position 2 or 3 is T, and the other is another letter, and position 1 is another letter.

So we have three positions to determine, but with the constraint that T is in one of 2 or 3.

We can think of two cases:

Case 1: T in position 2 -> word: _ T _ E R
Case 2: T in position 3 -> word: _ _ T E R

We need to find words that fit one of these patterns and use only available letters.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and we know T is used.

Common letters left: S, T, O, P, D, etc.

We can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 and tests a vowel for position 1 and a consonant for 3, or vice versa.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, for Case 1: _ T _ E R
Possible words:
- After T, the third letter must be a vowel or consonant that can form a word. Common words: 
  - ""OTTER"" -> but T is repeated? And O in position 1. But we have T in position 2 and 3? But we need position 3 to be a letter, then E R. ""OTTER"" has two T's? Then it would be O T T E R. But position 3 is T? Then we have T in position 2 and 3? But we know T is only one? Not necessarily, but we don't know. However, in feedback, for TIMER, T was present but wrong position, so it could be that there is only one T? But it might be duplicated? We don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

So without duplicates: 
- ""UTTER"" -> again duplicate T? U T T E R -> same.
- ""STYER"" -> but Y is absent? Y is ruled out (from BERYL: Y(x)).
- ""STOER""? Not a word? 
- ""STOER"" might not be common. 
- ""ATER""? But A is absent.

Better: ""OTTER"" is a word, but duplicate T.

""AFTER""? But A is absent.

""OUTER""? O U T E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but this is for Case 2? No, for Case 1 we need T in position 2.

For Case 1: _ T _ E R
- Position 1: any available letter except absent ones.
- Position 3: any available letter.

Examples:
- ""STYER"" invalid because Y absent.
- ""PTER"" is not 5 letters? We need 5 letters.

""OTTER"": O T T E R -> but position 3 is T, so it has two T's. But we don't know if T is duplicated? It could be.

But let's see: in TIMER, we had T in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one T in the word, but it could be more. However, the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. So we have to consider.

But for now, let's avoid if possible.

Another word: ""UTTER"" same issue.

""AFTER"" A absent.

""ENTER"" E in position 1? But we have E already at 4, and E might be duplicated? But in first guess, E was present but not at 5, and now we have E at 4. But we don't know if there is another E? The feedback doesn't show duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter is duplicated, the feedback might be tricky. For example, if the word has one E and you guess two, one might be marked as absent.

But in our case, we haven't guessed duplicates yet.

Perhaps we can try a word without duplicates for Case 1.

What about ""OTHER""? O T H E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:T, 3:H, 4:E, 5:R -> this fits Case 1: T in position 2.

And H is available? H not ruled out.

Similarly, ""OTTER"" has duplicate T, but ""OTHER"" does not.

""OTHER"" is a valid word.

Now, for Case 2: _ _ T E R
Examples:
- ""CATER"" but C and A absent.
- ""DATER"" A absent.
- ""HATER"" A absent.
- ""LATER"" A and L absent? L is absent.
- ""MATER"" M absent? M is absent from TIMER: M(x).
- ""PATER"" P A T E R -> A absent.
- ""RATER"" R at position 1? But we have R at 5, and R might be duplicated? But we don't know. Also, in ""RATER"", R is at 1 and 5? But position 1: R, then A absent? A is absent.

Another: ""WATER"" A absent.

""SOBER"" but B absent? B is absent from BERYL: B(x).

""COVER"" C absent.

""POKER"" P O K E R -> K is available? K not ruled out.

""POKER"" is a word: positions 1:P, 2:O, 3:K, 4:E, 5:R.

Similarly, ""POWER"" O W E R -> but then position 3: W? ""POWER"" is P O W E R.

""TOWER"" T O W E R -> but T is in position 1? But we are in Case 2, which is T in position 3? ""TOWER"" has T in position 1, not 3.

For Case 2, we need T in position 3: so _ _ T E R.

So ""POKER"" has K? And P and O.

""POSER"" P O S E R -> S is available.

""POSER"" is a word: P O S E R.

Similarly, ""DOPER"" D O P E R -> but P and D? ""DOPER"" might not be common? But valid.

""DOSER"" D O S E R.

But we also have T to place? In Case 2, T is in position 3, so the word must have T at 3.

So for Case 2: _ _ T E R

Examples:
- ""BITER"" B absent.
- ""CITER"" C absent.
- ""DITER"" not a word.
- ""FIGHTER"" too long.
- ""HITTER"" H I T T E R -> duplicate T? And I absent? I is absent from TIMER: I(x).
- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but that's 5 letters? L I T R E, positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4 and R at 5? Here R is at 4 and E at 5? Not matching.

We need the pattern to have E at 4 and R at 5, so the last two are fixed as ER.

So for Case 2: positions: 1,2,3=T,4=E,5=R? No: position 3 is T, then 4=E, 5=R.

So the word is: ? ? T E R

Examples:
- ""MITER"" M absent? M(x) from TIMER.
- ""NITER"" N absent.
- ""PETER"" P E T E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but E at 2 and 4? But we have E at 4, and E might be duplicated? But in this case, position 2 is E? But we know E cannot be at position 2 from BERYL feedback? BERYL had E at 2 and it was wrong position, so E is not at 2. So ""PETER"" would have E at 2, which is forbidden.

Similarly, ""RUTER"" R U T E R -> R at 1 and 5? But R at 1: we don't know if R is duplicated? But we have R at 5 fixed. Also, U is available.

But ""RUTER"" is not a common word? Router is 6 letters.

""SUPER"" S U P E R -> but no T? We need T at position 3.

""SUPER"" is S U P E R, so position 3 is P, not T.

We need T at 3.

""UTTER"" U T T E R -> but T at 2 and 3? So for Case 2, we need T at 3, but ""UTTER"" has T at 2 and 3? So position 3 is T, but also position 2 is T? So it fits the pattern? The pattern is _ _ T E R, so position 3 is T, but position 2 can be anything? In ""UTTER"", position 1:U, 2:T, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R. So position 3 is T, which is what we want for Case 2? But position 2 is also T? So it has duplicate T.

But the pattern for Case 2 is: position 3 must be T, but position 2 can be T or not? It can be, but we don't know.

Similarly, ""OTTER"" for Case 2: O T T E R -> position 3 is T? Yes, but position 2 is T? So again duplicate.

But we can consider.

Another word: ""AFTER"" A absent.

""ENTER"" E at 1? But E cannot be at 1? We don't know, but E is at 4, and we don't know about duplicates. But in ""ENTER"", E at 1 and 4? Position 1: E, which might be possible? But we have no feedback about E at position 1. However, in the first guess, E was at 5 and wrong, and second guess E at 2 and wrong, but position 1 has not been tested for E. So it could be.

But ""ENTER"" has E at 1 and 4? And T at 3? So for Case 2: _ _ T E R, ""ENTER"" would be E N T E R -> but N is absent? N(x) from CRANE.

So not.

""INTER"" I absent.

""OUTER"" O U T E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> this fits Case 2: T at position 3.

And O and U are available.

""OUTER"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""POKER"" is P O K E R, but no T? Position 3 is K, not T.

For Case 2, we need T at 3.

So ""OUTER"" is a good candidate.

Now, back to our guess: we need to choose a word that can help distinguish between the cases.

But we also know that T must be in position 2 or 3.

We can guess a word that has T in position 2, for example, to test Case 1.

Or one with T in position 3 for Case 2.

But we can also guess a word that has T in one of them and tests the other positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that covers common possibilities.

But we have two main candidates: ""OTHER"" for Case 1 (T in 2) and ""OUTER"" for Case 2 (T in 3).

If we guess ""OTHER"", it tests:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: T (which we suspect might be correct if Case 1)
- Position 3: H

And we know position 4 and 5 are E and R.

Similarly, if we guess ""OUTER"", it tests:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: T (for Case 2)

But we don't know which case.

We could guess a word that has T in position 2 and uses a common letter for position 1 and 3, or vice versa.

Another idea: guess a word that has T in position 3 and tests position 1 and 2 with common letters.

But we also have T present, so we must include T.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

First, for Case 1: _ T _ E R
Possible words with available letters (no absent letters):
- ""OTHER"" (O, T, H, E, R)
- ""UTTER"" (U, T, T, E, R) - duplicate T
- ""OTTER"" (O, T, T, E, R) - duplicate T
- ""STVER"" not a word.
- ""STYER"" invalid Y.
- ""PTER"" not 5 letters.
- ""DATER"" A absent.
- So ""OTHER"" is the main one without duplicates.

For Case 2: _ _ T E R
- ""OUTER"" (O, U, T, E, R)
- ""PETER"" (P, E, T, E, R) - but E at 2, which is forbidden (from BERYL, E not at 2)
- ""MITER"" M absent.
- ""NITER"" N absent.
- ""RUTER"" not common, but R U T E R? Might be accepted? But R at 1 and 5? Duplicate R? And U.
- ""SUTER"" not common.
- ""CITER"" C absent.
- ""HITTER"" H I T T E R -> I absent and duplicate T.
- ""JITTER"" too long.
- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but R at 4 and E at 5? Not matching our pattern (we need E at 4, R at 5). ""LITRE"" is L-I-T-R-E, so positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need 4:E and 5:R, so not.
- ""METER"" M absent and E at 2? Forbidden.
- ""POKER"" no T at 3.
- ""POSER"" no T.
- So ""OUTER"" is a good candidate for Case 2.

Also, ""AFTER"" is invalid due to A.

So we have two main possibilities: ""OTHER"" and ""OUTER"".

But ""OTHER"" has T in position 2, and ""OUTER"" has T in position 3.

We can choose one to test.

Since we have T present and we know it's not in 1, it must be in 2 or 3.

If we guess ""OTHER"":
- If T is in position 2, then we might get T(✓) at position 2, and then we know the word is _ T _ E R, and we have O and H to check.
- If T is not in position 2, then we know T must be in position 3 (since it's present), and then we get T(-) for position 2, meaning T is in the word but not at 2, so it must be at 3.

Similarly, if we guess ""OUTER"":
- If T is in position 3, we get T(✓) at 3.
- If not, then T must be in position 2.

But in ""OUTER"", position 3 is T, so if T is in position 3, it will be correct.

But we don't know.

Also, by guessing ""OTHER"", we test O and H.

Similarly, ""OUTER"" tests O and U.

Common letters: O is common, H and U are also common.

But we have no information about O, H, U.

We can choose one.

Another word: what about ""POWER""? But ""POWER"" is P O W E R, so positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But no T? We must include T because it's present. So we cannot guess a word without T.

Similarly, we must include T in the guess.

So we have to have T in the word.

Therefore, between ""OTHER"" and ""OUTER"", both are valid.

Let's see which one gives more information.

If we guess ""OTHER"":
- If we get T(✓) at position 2, then the word is _ T H E R, and we only need position 1. And from feedback, we'll know about O and H.
- If we get T(-) at position 2, then T is not at 2, so it must be at 3, and then the word is _ _ T E R, and we know O and H are not in the word? Not necessarily, but we get feedback on O and H.

Similarly for ""OUTER"".

But we have only two cases, so after this guess, we might solve it.

Since we have E and R fixed, and T must be in 2 or 3, we can also consider guessing a word that has T in position 3 and common letters for 1 and 2.

For example, ""OUTER"" does that.

But let's choose ""OTHER"" as a guess.

Or perhaps ""SHOER"" but S H O E R? But no T? Must include T.

Another word: ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But we know T cannot be in position 1 (from TIMER feedback: T(-) at position 1, so T not at 1). So ""TOWER"" has T at 1, which is forbidden. So invalid.

Similarly, we cannot have T in position 1.

So back to ""OTHER"" or ""OUTER"".

I think ""OTHER"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with ""OTHER"".

Then, based on feedback, we can determine.

But let's see the response format.

We need to output the guess.

So <guess>OTHER</guess>

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""OTHER"", then we get all correct? But we don't know.

If not, we get information.

But we have to make a guess.

Another possibility: the word could be ""UTTER"" or ""OTTER"", but let's try to avoid duplicates first.

So I think ""OTHER"" is fine.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
     - C, A, N are absent from the word.
     - R is present but not in position 2.
     - E is present but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (BERYL)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)
     - B, Y, L are absent.
     - E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked wrong).
     - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong).
   - **Guess 3 (TIMER)**: T(-), I(x), M(x), E(✓), R(✓)
     - T is present but not in position 1.
     - I and M are absent.
     - E is correct at position 4 (so the 4th letter is E).
     - R is correct at position 5 (so the 5th letter is R).

2. **Key Insights:**
   - The word ends with ""ER"" (positions 4 and 5 are fixed as E and R).
   - T is present but cannot be in position 1 (from TIMER feedback). Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, T must be in position 2 or 3.
   - Absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y (from all feedback).
   - Available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and others not ruled out.
   - Word structure: `_ _ _ E R` (positions 1, 2, 3 unknown, with T in either 2 or 3).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - Must include T (since it's confirmed present) and test its position (2 or 3).
   - Avoid absent letters and reuse E and R in their correct positions (4 and 5) to confirm consistency.
   - Test new common letters (e.g., O, H, U) to gather more information.
   - Prioritize words without duplicates for clearer feedback.
   - Two main candidate patterns:
     - **Case 1**: T in position 2 → `_ T _ E R` (e.g., ""OTHER"").
     - **Case 2**: T in position 3 → `_ _ T E R` (e.g., ""OUTER"").
   - ""OTHER"" is chosen because:
     - It tests T in position 2 (helping resolve the position ambiguity).
     - It introduces new common letters: O (position 1) and H (position 3), which are not ruled out.
     - If T is in position 2, feedback may confirm it (✓) or indicate it's misplaced (-), narrowing T to position 3.
     - Feedback on O and H will help identify the remaining letters.

4. **Expected Outcomes:**
   - If T is in position 2: Feedback may show T(✓) and provide info on O and H.
   - If T is not in position 2: Feedback will show T(-), confirming T must be in position 3, and provide info on O and H for other positions.
   - This guess maximizes information with common letters and avoids duplicates.

Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a word that maximizes the amount of useful information I can get. This means selecting a word with common letters that might appear in many 5-letter English words.\n\nI recall that many Wordle players start with words that contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. Vowels are crucial because almost every English word has at least one vowel. Among consonants, letters like R, S, T, L, and N appear frequently.\n\nConsidering this, a good starting word might be something like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another option is ""ROAST"".

Wait, C is out—invalid.  \n- **SERUM**: Has S,E,R,U,M—all new letters except E/R. Positions: R at 3, E at 2.  \n  - Feedback told us E isn\'t at position 5, but position 2 might work; same for R not at 2—so position 3 for R is fresh.  \n\nOther options: **ROUSE**? Has R,O,U,S,E. Positions: R(1), E(5)—but original feedback had E(-) at position 5, so E shouldn\'t be at end. Risk rechecking E at 5.  \n\nBetter to avoid reusing the position E was wrong in. Since E couldn\'t be at spot 5, placing it elsewhere—like **SERUM** (E at spot 2) or **BREAD** (R at 3, E at 4—E at 4 avoids position 5).  \n\n**BREAD** might be strong:  \n- B,R,E,A,D. But A is out! A was x in first guess → banned. So invalid.  \n\nRevised: **PRIDE**? Has P,R,I,D,E.  \n- Positions: R(2)—but R was tried at position 2 originally and was marked wrong (-), so placing R at position 2 again likely still wrong. Avoid reused positions for known letters.  \n\nBest candidates:  \n- **SPIRE**: R at 4, E at 5—but E at 5 was wrong before, so probably still wrong.  \n- **RODEO**: Has R,O,D,E,O—E at position 4. Avoids reused spots: R at position 1 (new), E at position 4 (new). Also tests O and D.  \n\nBut **RODEO** has duplicate O—might reduce information. Prefer all distinct letters.  \n\n**SOLVE**? Has S,O,L,V,E—E at position 5 → same issue. Avoid position 5 for E.  \n\n**STRIDE**: S,T,R,I,D,E.  \n- Positions: R(3), E(6)—wait, only 5 letters. **STRIP**? No E needed. Must include E.  \n\n**SHIRE**? E at 5 again—no.  \n\nBetter: **MERCY**? But C is out—forbidden.  \n\n**BERYL**? B,E,R,Y,L. Positions: R at 3, E at 2—both new slots. Letters: Tests B,Y,L.  \n\nKey points:  \n- Secret word has R and E, positions unknown but not index 2 for R and not index 5 for E.  \n- Must exclude C,A,N.  \n\n**BERYL** seems valid:  \n- E at position 2 → originally untested for E (since E was at 5 before).  \n- R at position 3 → originally R was at 2, so position 3 is new.  \n- Tests B,Y,L—new letters.  \n\nAlternative: **PERKY**—but K new, but E at position 4 avoids previous error slots.  \n\nHowever, **BERYL** is a gemstone—valid English word. Solid choice to test R and E in new contexts while introducing fresh consonants.  \n\nDecision: Next guess → **BERYL**.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  \n- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.  \n- **R(-)**: R is in the word, but not in position 2.  \n- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.  \n- **N(x)**: N is not in the word.  \n- **E(-)**: E is in the word, but not in position 5.  \n\nKey insights:  \n1. **R** and **E** are confirmed present but misplaced.  \n2. **C, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.  \n3. R cannot be in position 2 (tried incorrectly), and E cannot be in position 5 (tried incorrectly).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n4. Must include **R** and **E** in *new positions*. Ideal positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is ruled out). For E: 1–4 (position 5 ruled out).  \n5. Should introduce common unused letters like **S, T, L, B, P, D, M**, or vowels **O, I, U**, while avoiding C, A, N.  \n6. Prioritize words with distinct letters to maximize information.  \n\nA strong candidate is **BERYL**:  \n- Tests **R** in position 3 (new position)  \n- Tests **E** in position 2 (new position)  \n- Introduces new letters: **B, Y, L** (common consonants and vowel-like Y)  \n- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N) and reused positions for R/E.  \n\nThis guess optimally narrows possibilities for the secret word.\n\n<guess>BERYL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nFirst guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nSecond guess ""BERYL"": B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)\n\nFrom the first guess, we know:\n- R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.\n- C, A, N are not in the word.\n\nFrom the second guess:\n- B(x): B is not in the word.\n- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 2 (since in BERYL, E was in position 2).\n- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since in BERYL, R was in position 3).\n- Y(x): Y is not in the word.\n- L(x): L is not in the word.\n\nNow, combining the information:\n- Letters confirmed in the word: R, E.\n- Letters ruled out: C, A, N, B, Y, L.\n- Position constraints:\n  - R is not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from BERYL). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n  - E is not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from BERYL). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBecause the word has 5 letters and we know only R and E must be included, we need to find a word that contains R and E, and three more letters that have not been ruled out.\n\nRuled out letters: A, B, C, L, N, Y. So available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.\n\nWe also know the secret word must be composed of only these available letters plus R and E.\n\nPossible positions for R: 1, 4, 5\nPossible positions for E: 1, 3, 4\n\nNote that R and E might occupy the same position? But no, because each position can only have one letter. Also, they are two distinct letters unless the word has duplicates? But we don\'t know yet. But from the feedback, since we got two (probably) distinct letters, we assume they are different.\n\nNow, we have to form a word that respects:\n- Includes R and E at positions that are consistent with the exclusions.\n- Does not include any ruled out letters.\n\nMoreover, we must avoid the positions where they were misplaced.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and E, and try to assign positions.\n\nPossible positions:\n\nCase 1: R at position 1.\nThen E can be at 3 or 4 (not at 1 because same position, and not at 2 or 5).\n\nSo if R is at 1, then E at 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, if R at 4, then E at 1 or 3 (since E cannot be at 4 same as R? Wait, position 4 would have E and R? No, same position cannot have two letters. So when R is at 4, E cannot be at 4).\n\nSimilarly, R at 5: E at 1 or 3.\n\nWe also need to fill the other positions with letters that aren\'t excluded.\n\nSince we have limited tries, we want a word that tests new common letters and further constraints.\n\nLet\'s list possible words.\n\nCommon words with R and E:\n\nThink of words where R is in position 1: e.g., ""RE..."". Then E must be at 3 or 4.\n\nExamples:\n- ""RESET"" has duplicate E, and S and T allowed? But E is at position 2 and 5? Not allowed: E cannot be at 5 and also we have E at 2 in second guess? But feedback: E(-) at position 2 meaning wrong position, so E might be at other positions but we know E cannot be at 2 in this word? Wait.\n\nActually, ""RESET"" has E at 2 and 5. Position 2 we know E is not correct there from second guess? Yes, but E can be at 5? Wait, no: first guess had E at 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at 5. Similarly, in second guess E at 2 wrong. So ""RESET"" would place E at 2 and 5, both forbidden positions? So invalid.\n\nAnother one: ""RIPER"" → has R at 1 and E at 4? And positions: \nPosition 1: R (known to be acceptable location? but not confirmed if correct)\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: P\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R? But now E is in position 4: which is allowed? Yes, because E was not ruled out for position 4. And R at position 4? Wait, ""RIPER"" has two R\'s? And R at position 5: but position 5 is allowed? R can be at 5? Since we only have position constraints for R: cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.\n\nBut let\'s check: the word must have at least one R and one E. But ""RIPER"" has R at three positions? Not efficient but possible.\n\nMoreover, in the first guess, we had E at 5 which was wrong, so the secret word might have E at 4. Similarly R at 4 or elsewhere.\n\nBut multiple R\'s? Possible? The rules don\'t forbid duplicate letters.\n\nHowever, in feedback, if a letter is duplicated, it can complicate. For simplicity, maybe avoid duplicates for now.\n\nBut considering: if there is duplicate, the feedback might mark multiples. But for now, let\'s assume we prefer distinct letters if possible.\n\nAnother idea: use a word with R and E and test new common consonants.\n\nFor example, S, T, P, etc.\n\nPossible word: ""ROGUE"". But O and U: not excluded. R at 1, E at 5? E is at 5? But first guess: E cannot be at 5. So not.\n\nWord: ""RIFLE""? But F and L? But L is ruled out: from second guess, L(x), so L not in word. So no.\n\n""RIDER"" - R at 1, D, then E at 4? R and D: but R at 5? Duplicate R.\n\nPerhaps ""RISEN""? But S and N? N ruled out? First guess: N(x), so not allowed.\n\nSince A, N, C, B, L, Y are out, available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.\n\nTry R at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""R_ E _ _"". Like:\n\n- ""RIPER"" but duplicate R? Or non-distinct.\n- ""RIVER"": R at 1, I, V, E at 4? Wait, E at 4? But position: ""RIVER"" has positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? E is at position 4? Which is allowed? E can be at position 4. But R at 1 and 5: which R at 5 is possible? R can be at 1,4,5? So 5 is allowed? Maybe.\n\nBut R at 5: we have constraint R not at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.\n\nSimilarly E at 4: not forbidden.\n\nBut I is new? V? But we need to test.\n\nAnother word: ""RISER"" - R at 1,5, S, E at 4? But S allowed. But similar to above.\n\nBut we might get less information due to duplicate.\n\nAlternative: positions R at 4 and E at 1 or 3.\n\nFor example, R at position 4: then word ends with _ _ _ R ? \n\nBut E must be at 1 or 3.\n\nIf E at 3: "" _ _ E R _""\n\nLike ""PILER""? But L ruled out? L not allowed.\n\n""TIMER"" - T, I, M, E, R? Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:M, 4:E, 5:R? \nBut E is at position 4? Which is allowed? And R at position 5? Also allowed? T,I,M are not ruled out.\n\nAnd E at position 4: from feedback, E cannot be at 2 or 5, so 4 or others? E can be at 4.\n\nSimilarly, R at 5? R cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.\n\nAlso, T,I,M new letters.\n\nSimilarly, is ""TIMER"" valid? Yes, meaning a device that times.\n\nBut let\'s confirm constraints:\n- R: position 5, not 2 or 3 -> allowed.\n- E: position 4? But in the secret word, E must be placed at a new position? We haven\'t tested position 4 for E, so it\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, R at position 5: we tried R at position 2 and 3? In CRANE, R at 2; in BERYL, R at 3. So position 5 is new and allowed.\n\nSimilarly E at 4: never tested, so possible.\n\nBut we have another possibility: R at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we skip position 3? \n\nFor example: ""R _ _ E _"" \n\nWith the middle three positions letters from allowed set.\n\nWord: ""ROUGE""? E at 5? Not allowed.\n\n""ROUSE"" E at 5? Not.\n\n""RANGE"" G and E at 5? E at 5? Not allowed.\n\n""RIPEN"" N ruled out? Not.\n\nSo perhaps ""RIPER"" but duplicate? Or ""RIVER"" which we considered.\n\nBut ""RIVER"" has E at position 4? And R at 5? And V and I? Available.\n\nBut let\'s compare: ""TIMER"" tests T,I,M,E,R with E at 4 and R at 5.\n\nIt avoids duplicate letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""TIMER"" uses common letters.\n\nAnother option: ""PORES"" P,O,R,E,S? R at position 3? But R cannot be at 3? Because second guess had R at 3 and it was wrong! So if R at position 3, it would be incorrect. Thus ""PORES"" has R at 3, which is forbidden? No: the constraint is that R cannot be at 3? Because in BERYL, R was at 3 and feedback was R(-), meaning R is not in position 3. So we cannot put R at position 3. Similarly, position 2 was wrong.\n\nTherefore in ""TIMER"", R is at 5, which is new and allowed.\n\nSimilarly E at 4, also allowed.\n\nAlso, the word doesn\'t have any ruled out letters: T, I, M are possible.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""TIMER"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a better one: another word might be ""HOMER""? But O and H? E at 4? R at 5? Also possible? But we get less common letters? Slightly less frequent.\n\n""OFFER""? But duplicate F? And F? But E at 4? R at 5? O,F,F? Duplicate.\n\n""TIMER"" seems solid.\n\nSo next guess: ""TIMER""\n\nBut to confirm:\n- T: new\n- I: new\n- M: new\n- E: now placed at position 4, which is new.\n- R: at position 5, new.\n\nHoping to get ✓ on E or R, or identify correct letters.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, B, Y, L (from ""CRANE"" and ""BERYL"" feedback).\n- **Confirmed present letters**: R and E.\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - R cannot be in position 2 (from ""CRANE"" R(-)) or position 3 (from ""BERYL"" R(-)), so R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n  - E cannot be in position 2 (from ""BERYL"" E(-)) or position 5 (from ""CRANE"" E(-)), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and E in new positions that respect the constraints (avoiding positions 2 and 3 for R, and positions 2 and 5 for E).\n- Use only available letters (not excluded), such as D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.\n- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information and avoid duplicates for clarity.\n\nAfter evaluating options, ""TIMER"" fits well:\n- R is in position 5 (allowed).\n- E is in position 4 (allowed).\n- Tests new common consonants T, M, and vowel I.\n- Avoids excluded letters and duplicate letters.\n\n<guess>TIMER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)\nGuess 3: TIMER -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n  - C, A, N are absent.\n  - R is present but not in position 2.\n  - E is present but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: BERYL -> B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)\n  - B, Y, L are absent.\n  - E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked wrong).\n  - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong).\n\nGuess 3: TIMER -> T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n  - T is present but not in position 1.\n  - I and M are absent.\n  - E is correct at position 4 (so the 4th letter is E).\n  - R is correct at position 5 (so the 5th letter is R).\n\nSo, we know:\n- The word has E in the 4th position and R in the 5th position. So the word ends with ""ER"".\n- Additionally, we have T present in the word, but not in position 1 (since in TIMER it was in position 1 and marked as wrong position).\n- We have R and E confirmed from the start, and now we know their exact positions: 4 and 5.\n\nAlso, from the first two guesses, we know that R is not in position 2 or 3, and E is not in position 2 or 5 (but now we know E is in 4, so that\'s consistent). Also, R is now fixed at 5.\n\nNow, the word structure: _ _ _ E R\n\nWe know T is in the word but not in position 1. So T must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nAlso, we have a list of absent letters: C, A, N, B, Y, L, I, M.\n\nSo absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y.\n\nTherefore, available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and possibly others, but we know T is present.\n\nSince T is present and must be in position 2 or 3, we can consider words of the form:\n- If T is in position 2: _ T _ E R\n- If T is in position 3: _ _ T E R\n\nWe also need to fill the first and the third (or second) position with available letters, and the word must be a valid English word.\n\nMoreover, we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on the 4th guess), so we want to maximize information.\n\nBut we also have two positions to figure out: positions 1 and either 2 or 3 (depending on where T is). Actually, we don\'t know which of the two positions T is in.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 and tests a common letter for position 1 and 3, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nBut note: we have only two unknown positions? Actually, no: the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know 4 and 5 (E and R). So we need positions 1,2,3.\n\nBut we know T is in the word and must be in either 2 or 3. So one of position 2 or 3 is T, and the other is another letter, and position 1 is another letter.\n\nSo we have three positions to determine, but with the constraint that T is in one of 2 or 3.\n\nWe can think of two cases:\n\nCase 1: T in position 2 -> word: _ T _ E R\nCase 2: T in position 3 -> word: _ _ T E R\n\nWe need to find words that fit one of these patterns and use only available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and we know T is used.\n\nCommon letters left: S, T, O, P, D, etc.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 and tests a vowel for position 1 and a consonant for 3, or vice versa.\n\nBut we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s list possible words for each case.\n\nFirst, for Case 1: _ T _ E R\nPossible words:\n- After T, the third letter must be a vowel or consonant that can form a word. Common words: \n  - ""OTTER"" -> but T is repeated? And O in position 1. But we have T in position 2 and 3? But we need position 3 to be a letter, then E R. ""OTTER"" has two T\'s? Then it would be O T T E R. But position 3 is T? Then we have T in position 2 and 3? But we know T is only one? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know. However, in feedback, for TIMER, T was present but wrong position, so it could be that there is only one T? But it might be duplicated? We don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nSo without duplicates: \n- ""UTTER"" -> again duplicate T? U T T E R -> same.\n- ""STYER"" -> but Y is absent? Y is ruled out (from BERYL: Y(x)).\n- ""STOER""? Not a word? \n- ""STOER"" might not be common. \n- ""ATER""? But A is absent.\n\nBetter: ""OTTER"" is a word, but duplicate T.\n\n""AFTER""? But A is absent.\n\n""OUTER""? O U T E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but this is for Case 2? No, for Case 1 we need T in position 2.\n\nFor Case 1: _ T _ E R\n- Position 1: any available letter except absent ones.\n- Position 3: any available letter.\n\nExamples:\n- ""STYER"" invalid because Y absent.\n- ""PTER"" is not 5 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n""OTTER"": O T T E R -> but position 3 is T, so it has two T\'s. But we don\'t know if T is duplicated? It could be.\n\nBut let\'s see: in TIMER, we had T in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one T in the word, but it could be more. However, the feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicates. So we have to consider.\n\nBut for now, let\'s avoid if possible.\n\nAnother word: ""UTTER"" same issue.\n\n""AFTER"" A absent.\n\n""ENTER"" E in position 1? But we have E already at 4, and E might be duplicated? But in first guess, E was present but not at 5, and now we have E at 4. But we don\'t know if there is another E? The feedback doesn\'t show duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter is duplicated, the feedback might be tricky. For example, if the word has one E and you guess two, one might be marked as absent.\n\nBut in our case, we haven\'t guessed duplicates yet.\n\nPerhaps we can try a word without duplicates for Case 1.\n\nWhat about ""OTHER""? O T H E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:T, 3:H, 4:E, 5:R -> this fits Case 1: T in position 2.\n\nAnd H is available? H not ruled out.\n\nSimilarly, ""OTTER"" has duplicate T, but ""OTHER"" does not.\n\n""OTHER"" is a valid word.\n\nNow, for Case 2: _ _ T E R\nExamples:\n- ""CATER"" but C and A absent.\n- ""DATER"" A absent.\n- ""HATER"" A absent.\n- ""LATER"" A and L absent? L is absent.\n- ""MATER"" M absent? M is absent from TIMER: M(x).\n- ""PATER"" P A T E R -> A absent.\n- ""RATER"" R at position 1? But we have R at 5, and R might be duplicated? But we don\'t know. Also, in ""RATER"", R is at 1 and 5? But position 1: R, then A absent? A is absent.\n\nAnother: ""WATER"" A absent.\n\n""SOBER"" but B absent? B is absent from BERYL: B(x).\n\n""COVER"" C absent.\n\n""POKER"" P O K E R -> K is available? K not ruled out.\n\n""POKER"" is a word: positions 1:P, 2:O, 3:K, 4:E, 5:R.\n\nSimilarly, ""POWER"" O W E R -> but then position 3: W? ""POWER"" is P O W E R.\n\n""TOWER"" T O W E R -> but T is in position 1? But we are in Case 2, which is T in position 3? ""TOWER"" has T in position 1, not 3.\n\nFor Case 2, we need T in position 3: so _ _ T E R.\n\nSo ""POKER"" has K? And P and O.\n\n""POSER"" P O S E R -> S is available.\n\n""POSER"" is a word: P O S E R.\n\nSimilarly, ""DOPER"" D O P E R -> but P and D? ""DOPER"" might not be common? But valid.\n\n""DOSER"" D O S E R.\n\nBut we also have T to place? In Case 2, T is in position 3, so the word must have T at 3.\n\nSo for Case 2: _ _ T E R\n\nExamples:\n- ""BITER"" B absent.\n- ""CITER"" C absent.\n- ""DITER"" not a word.\n- ""FIGHTER"" too long.\n- ""HITTER"" H I T T E R -> duplicate T? And I absent? I is absent from TIMER: I(x).\n- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but that\'s 5 letters? L I T R E, positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4 and R at 5? Here R is at 4 and E at 5? Not matching.\n\nWe need the pattern to have E at 4 and R at 5, so the last two are fixed as ER.\n\nSo for Case 2: positions: 1,2,3=T,4=E,5=R? No: position 3 is T, then 4=E, 5=R.\n\nSo the word is: ? ? T E R\n\nExamples:\n- ""MITER"" M absent? M(x) from TIMER.\n- ""NITER"" N absent.\n- ""PETER"" P E T E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but E at 2 and 4? But we have E at 4, and E might be duplicated? But in this case, position 2 is E? But we know E cannot be at position 2 from BERYL feedback? BERYL had E at 2 and it was wrong position, so E is not at 2. So ""PETER"" would have E at 2, which is forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, ""RUTER"" R U T E R -> R at 1 and 5? But R at 1: we don\'t know if R is duplicated? But we have R at 5 fixed. Also, U is available.\n\nBut ""RUTER"" is not a common word? Router is 6 letters.\n\n""SUPER"" S U P E R -> but no T? We need T at position 3.\n\n""SUPER"" is S U P E R, so position 3 is P, not T.\n\nWe need T at 3.\n\n""UTTER"" U T T E R -> but T at 2 and 3? So for Case 2, we need T at 3, but ""UTTER"" has T at 2 and 3? So position 3 is T, but also position 2 is T? So it fits the pattern? The pattern is _ _ T E R, so position 3 is T, but position 2 can be anything? In ""UTTER"", position 1:U, 2:T, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R. So position 3 is T, which is what we want for Case 2? But position 2 is also T? So it has duplicate T.\n\nBut the pattern for Case 2 is: position 3 must be T, but position 2 can be T or not? It can be, but we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, ""OTTER"" for Case 2: O T T E R -> position 3 is T? Yes, but position 2 is T? So again duplicate.\n\nBut we can consider.\n\nAnother word: ""AFTER"" A absent.\n\n""ENTER"" E at 1? But E cannot be at 1? We don\'t know, but E is at 4, and we don\'t know about duplicates. But in ""ENTER"", E at 1 and 4? Position 1: E, which might be possible? But we have no feedback about E at position 1. However, in the first guess, E was at 5 and wrong, and second guess E at 2 and wrong, but position 1 has not been tested for E. So it could be.\n\nBut ""ENTER"" has E at 1 and 4? And T at 3? So for Case 2: _ _ T E R, ""ENTER"" would be E N T E R -> but N is absent? N(x) from CRANE.\n\nSo not.\n\n""INTER"" I absent.\n\n""OUTER"" O U T E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> this fits Case 2: T at position 3.\n\nAnd O and U are available.\n\n""OUTER"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""POKER"" is P O K E R, but no T? Position 3 is K, not T.\n\nFor Case 2, we need T at 3.\n\nSo ""OUTER"" is a good candidate.\n\nNow, back to our guess: we need to choose a word that can help distinguish between the cases.\n\nBut we also know that T must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nWe can guess a word that has T in position 2, for example, to test Case 1.\n\nOr one with T in position 3 for Case 2.\n\nBut we can also guess a word that has T in one of them and tests the other positions.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that covers common possibilities.\n\nBut we have two main candidates: ""OTHER"" for Case 1 (T in 2) and ""OUTER"" for Case 2 (T in 3).\n\nIf we guess ""OTHER"", it tests:\n- Position 1: O\n- Position 2: T (which we suspect might be correct if Case 1)\n- Position 3: H\n\nAnd we know position 4 and 5 are E and R.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""OUTER"", it tests:\n- Position 1: O\n- Position 2: U\n- Position 3: T (for Case 2)\n\nBut we don\'t know which case.\n\nWe could guess a word that has T in position 2 and uses a common letter for position 1 and 3, or vice versa.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that has T in position 3 and tests position 1 and 2 with common letters.\n\nBut we also have T present, so we must include T.\n\nLet\'s list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.\n\nFirst, for Case 1: _ T _ E R\nPossible words with available letters (no absent letters):\n- ""OTHER"" (O, T, H, E, R)\n- ""UTTER"" (U, T, T, E, R) - duplicate T\n- ""OTTER"" (O, T, T, E, R) - duplicate T\n- ""STVER"" not a word.\n- ""STYER"" invalid Y.\n- ""PTER"" not 5 letters.\n- ""DATER"" A absent.\n- So ""OTHER"" is the main one without duplicates.\n\nFor Case 2: _ _ T E R\n- ""OUTER"" (O, U, T, E, R)\n- ""PETER"" (P, E, T, E, R) - but E at 2, which is forbidden (from BERYL, E not at 2)\n- ""MITER"" M absent.\n- ""NITER"" N absent.\n- ""RUTER"" not common, but R U T E R? Might be accepted? But R at 1 and 5? Duplicate R? And U.\n- ""SUTER"" not common.\n- ""CITER"" C absent.\n- ""HITTER"" H I T T E R -> I absent and duplicate T.\n- ""JITTER"" too long.\n- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but R at 4 and E at 5? Not matching our pattern (we need E at 4, R at 5). ""LITRE"" is L-I-T-R-E, so positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need 4:E and 5:R, so not.\n- ""METER"" M absent and E at 2? Forbidden.\n- ""POKER"" no T at 3.\n- ""POSER"" no T.\n- So ""OUTER"" is a good candidate for Case 2.\n\nAlso, ""AFTER"" is invalid due to A.\n\nSo we have two main possibilities: ""OTHER"" and ""OUTER"".\n\nBut ""OTHER"" has T in position 2, and ""OUTER"" has T in position 3.\n\nWe can choose one to test.\n\nSince we have T present and we know it\'s not in 1, it must be in 2 or 3.\n\nIf we guess ""OTHER"":\n- If T is in position 2, then we might get T(✓) at position 2, and then we know the word is _ T _ E R, and we have O and H to check.\n- If T is not in position 2, then we know T must be in position 3 (since it\'s present), and then we get T(-) for position 2, meaning T is in the word but not at 2, so it must be at 3.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""OUTER"":\n- If T is in position 3, we get T(✓) at 3.\n- If not, then T must be in position 2.\n\nBut in ""OUTER"", position 3 is T, so if T is in position 3, it will be correct.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAlso, by guessing ""OTHER"", we test O and H.\n\nSimilarly, ""OUTER"" tests O and U.\n\nCommon letters: O is common, H and U are also common.\n\nBut we have no information about O, H, U.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nAnother word: what about ""POWER""? But ""POWER"" is P O W E R, so positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But no T? We must include T because it\'s present. So we cannot guess a word without T.\n\nSimilarly, we must include T in the guess.\n\nSo we have to have T in the word.\n\nTherefore, between ""OTHER"" and ""OUTER"", both are valid.\n\nLet\'s see which one gives more information.\n\nIf we guess ""OTHER"":\n- If we get T(✓) at position 2, then the word is _ T H E R, and we only need position 1. And from feedback, we\'ll know about O and H.\n- If we get T(-) at position 2, then T is not at 2, so it must be at 3, and then the word is _ _ T E R, and we know O and H are not in the word? Not necessarily, but we get feedback on O and H.\n\nSimilarly for ""OUTER"".\n\nBut we have only two cases, so after this guess, we might solve it.\n\nSince we have E and R fixed, and T must be in 2 or 3, we can also consider guessing a word that has T in position 3 and common letters for 1 and 2.\n\nFor example, ""OUTER"" does that.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""OTHER"" as a guess.\n\nOr perhaps ""SHOER"" but S H O E R? But no T? Must include T.\n\nAnother word: ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But we know T cannot be in position 1 (from TIMER feedback: T(-) at position 1, so T not at 1). So ""TOWER"" has T at 1, which is forbidden. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot have T in position 1.\n\nSo back to ""OTHER"" or ""OUTER"".\n\nI think ""OTHER"" is a good guess.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""OTHER"".\n\nThen, based on feedback, we can determine.\n\nBut let\'s see the response format.\n\nWe need to output the guess.\n\nSo <guess>OTHER</guess>\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we might get.\n\nIf the word is ""OTHER"", then we get all correct? But we don\'t know.\n\nIf not, we get information.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAnother possibility: the word could be ""UTTER"" or ""OTTER"", but let\'s try to avoid duplicates first.\n\nSo I think ""OTHER"" is fine.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**\n   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n     - C, A, N are absent from the word.\n     - R is present but not in position 2.\n     - E is present but not in position 5.\n   - **Guess 2 (BERYL)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)\n     - B, Y, L are absent.\n     - E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked wrong).\n     - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong).\n   - **Guess 3 (TIMER)**: T(-), I(x), M(x), E(✓), R(✓)\n     - T is present but not in position 1.\n     - I and M are absent.\n     - E is correct at position 4 (so the 4th letter is E).\n     - R is correct at position 5 (so the 5th letter is R).\n\n2. **Key Insights:**\n   - The word ends with ""ER"" (positions 4 and 5 are fixed as E and R).\n   - T is present but cannot be in position 1 (from TIMER feedback). Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, T must be in position 2 or 3.\n   - Absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y (from all feedback).\n   - Available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and others not ruled out.\n   - Word structure: `_ _ _ E R` (positions 1, 2, 3 unknown, with T in either 2 or 3).\n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**\n   - Must include T (since it\'s confirmed present) and test its position (2 or 3).\n   - Avoid absent letters and reuse E and R in their correct positions (4 and 5) to confirm consistency.\n   - Test new common letters (e.g., O, H, U) to gather more information.\n   - Prioritize words without duplicates for clearer feedback.\n   - Two main candidate patterns:\n     - **Case 1**: T in position 2 → `_ T _ E R` (e.g., ""OTHER"").\n     - **Case 2**: T in position 3 → `_ _ T E R` (e.g., ""OUTER"").\n   - ""OTHER"" is chosen because:\n     - It tests T in position 2 (helping resolve the position ambiguity).\n     - It introduces new common letters: O (position 1) and H (position 3), which are not ruled out.\n     - If T is in position 2, feedback may confirm it (✓) or indicate it\'s misplaced (-), narrowing T to position 3.\n     - Feedback on O and H will help identify the remaining letters.\n\n4. **Expected Outcomes:**\n   - If T is in position 2: Feedback may show T(✓) and provide info on O and H.\n   - If T is not in position 2: Feedback will show T(-), confirming T must be in position 3, and provide info on O and H for other positions.\n   - This guess maximizes information with common letters and avoids duplicates.\n\n<guess>OTHER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)\nGuess 3: TIMER -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: OTHER -> FEEDBACK: O(x) T(✓) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from Guess 4: OTHER -> O(x) T(✓) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)
This means:
- O is absent (x)
- T is correct and in the right position (position 2) (✓)
- H is absent (x)
- E is correct (position 4) (✓)
- R is correct (position 5) (✓)

So now we know:
- The word has T in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5. So the word is: _ T _ E R
- O and H are absent (so we add them to the absent list)
- Previously absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y (from guesses 1, 2, 3)
- Now adding O and H to absent: so absent letters: A, B, C, H, I, L, M, N, O, Y

We also know from previous feedback:
- E is not in position 5 (from guess 1) but now we have it at 4, so that's consistent.
- R is not in position 2 or 3 (from guess 1 and 2) but now at 5, which is correct.

Now, the word structure: _ T _ E R

We need to find the first and third letters.

Available letters (not absent): D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others, but common ones: D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W)

We must avoid the absent letters.

Also, from guess 3 (TIMER): T was present but not in position 1, which is consistent because now we have T at 2.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ T _ E R and uses available letters.

Possible words:
- We need to fill position 1 and 3 with available letters.

Common words:
- ""UTTER"" - but U is available? Yes, and T is at 2, then T at 3? But we have to check if duplicate T is allowed? It might be, but let's see.
  - ""UTTER"": positions: 1:U, 2:T, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but position 3 is T, which is the same as position 2? So duplicate T.
- ""OTTER"" - but O is absent? O(x) from this guess, so O cannot be used. So invalid.
- ""AFTER"" - A absent.
- ""ENTER"" - E at position 1? But E is at 4, and we don't know about duplicates. But N absent? N(x) from guess 1. Also, E at 1: we have no feedback that E cannot be at 1, but in guess 2, E was at 2 and wrong, and in guess 1 at 5 and wrong. So E at 1 might be possible? But ""ENTER"" has E at 1 and 4? Duplicate E? And N absent, so invalid.
- ""UTTER"" is a possibility, but let's see if there are others without duplicates.

Another word: ""UTTER"" is one option.

But we can also consider ""APTER"" but A and P? A absent.

""UTTER"" seems like a candidate.

But let's see if there is a word with different letters.

For example, ""STVER"" not a word.

""STYER"" Y absent.

""PTER"" not 5 letters.

""ATER"" A absent.

So, common words: ""UTTER"" and perhaps ""DATER"" but A absent.

""FEWER"" but F E W E R -> positions: 1:F, 2:E, but we need T at 2? We have T fixed at 2, so position 2 must be T. So ""FEWER"" has E at 2, which is not T. So invalid.

Similarly, any word must have T at position 2.

So pattern: [letter] T [letter] E R

With available letters for position 1 and 3.

Position 1: can be D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W, etc.

Position 3: same, but must form a word.

Possible words:
- ""UTTER"" - U at 1, T at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So U and T (duplicate).
- ""DETER"" - D E T E R -> but position 2 is E? We need T at 2. So invalid.
- ""PETER"" - P E T E R -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.
- ""SOWER"" - S O W E R -> O absent? O(x) from this guess. Invalid.
- ""SUPER"" - S U P E R -> position 2 is U, not T. Invalid.
- ""TAMER"" - T A M E R -> A and M absent, and position 1 is T? But we have T at 2, so position 1 cannot be T? We don't know, but T is at 2, so position 1 could be T? But we have T at 2 fixed, so if position 1 is T, that's duplicate. But ""TAMER"" has T at 1 and 2? Not, ""TAMER"" is T A M E R, so position 1: T, 2: A, but we need position 2 to be T, so not.

We need position 2 to be T, so the word must have T at 2.

So ""UTTER"" is a valid word: U T T E R.

Another possibility: ""BUTTER"" is 6 letters.

""UTTER"" is 5 letters.

""ETTER"" not a word? Or ""UTTER"" is the main one.

""UTERI"" not, that's 5 but ends with I, not R.

So ""UTTER"" seems the most common.

But we have position 3 to fill, and in ""UTTER"" it's T.

Another word: ""APTER"" not.

""OXTER"" but O absent.

""FUTER"" not common.

""JUTER"" not common.

""VUTER"" not a word.

So ""UTTER"" is a common word that fits.

We can also consider ""DATER"" but A absent.

So I think ""UTTER"" is the word to guess.

But let's see if there are other options.

""STERN"" but N absent and position 2 is T? ""STERN"" is S T E R N -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:R, 5:N -> but we need E at 4 and R at 5? Here E at 3 and R at 4, N at 5? Not matching.

""STEER"" S T E E R -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R -> but we have E at 4? Here position 4 is E, and R at 5, so that matches? But position 3 is E, which might be duplicate? And we need to check if E can be at 3? We have no feedback against E at 3.

But ""STEER"" has E at 3 and 4? So duplicate E.

And S is available.

But we have the pattern: _ T _ E R, so for ""STEER"": position 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R -> so position 3 is E, which is a vowel.

But we don't know if E is duplicated.

Similarly, ""SHEER"" but H absent? H(x) from this guess.

""SWEER"" not common.

""STEER"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""SKEER"" not common.

""QUEER"" Q U E E R -> position 2 is U, not T. Invalid.

So ""STEER"" is another possibility.

But in ""STEER"", position 3 is E, which is a vowel, and we have E at 4.

Now, we have two candidates: ""UTTER"" and ""STEER"".

But ""UTTER"" has U at 1 and T at 3, while ""STEER"" has S at 1 and E at 3.

We need to choose one to guess.

Since we have limited guesses, we can pick one that tests new letters.

In ""UTTER"", we test U and the possibility of duplicate T.

In ""STEER"", we test S and the possibility of duplicate E.

But we know E is at 4, and we don't know if it can be duplicated? Similarly for T.

But from feedback, we have no duplicate letters so far, so it might be single.

But we have to consider.

Another word: ""DIVER"" D I V E R -> but I absent? I(x) from TIMER.

""GIVER"" G I V E R -> I absent.

""LIVER"" L absent.

""RIVER"" R I V E R -> I absent and duplicate R? R at 1 and 5? But we have R at 5 fixed, so duplicate possible? But I absent.

""WIVER"" not common.

""SEVER"" S E V E R -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.

""PURE"" not 5 letters.

""PUTER"" not common, but P U T E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but we need position 2 to be T? Here position 2 is U, not T. So invalid.

We need position 2 to be T.

So back to ""UTTER"" and ""STEER"".

""STEER"" has position 2 as T? Yes, S T E E R, so position 2 is T.

Position 1: S, position 3: E.

But E is at position 3, which is not 4, so it might be a different E? Or duplicate.

Similarly, ""UTTER"" has U at 1 and T at 3.

Now, U and S are both available.

We can choose ""UTTER"" to test the duplicate T possibility.

Or ""STEER"" for duplicate E.

But let's see the feedback from guess 4: we have T at 2 correct, so the word has T at 2.

If we guess ""UTTER"", and if the word is ""UTTER"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on U and the duplicate T.

Similarly for ""STEER"".

But there might be other words.

Another word: ""DETER"" but position 2 is E, not T.

""TERRY"" not, ends with Y.

""TERSE"" T E R S E -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.

""TUNER"" T U N E R -> but N absent? N(x) from guess 1. And position 1 is T? But we have T at 2, so if position 1 is T, duplicate? ""TUNER"" has T at 1 and 2? Not, ""TUNER"" is T U N E R, so position 1:T, 2:U, but we need position 2 to be T, so not.

We need position 2 to be T, so the first letter can be any except T? Or duplicate? But in ""UTTER"", position 1 is U, not T.

So position 1 is not T, because if it were T, then in ""TIMER"" when we had T at 1, it was marked as present but wrong position, but now we know T is at 2, so position 1 cannot be T? Because if position 1 were T, then in ""TIMER"" (guess 3) T at 1 should have been correct? But it was marked as T(-), meaning present but wrong position, so T is not at position 1. Therefore, position 1 cannot be T. So no duplicate T at position 1.

Similarly, in the word, T is only at position 2? Or could be elsewhere? We don't know.

But in ""UTTER"", if we have T at 2 and T at 3, that's possible.

Similarly, in ""STEER"", T at 2 and E at 3 and 4.

But for position 1, it cannot be T.

So for ""UTTER"", position 1 is U, which is not T.

Now, let's list all possible words that fit _ T _ E R with available letters.

Available letters for position 1: D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W (and others like K, but less common)

For position 3: same, but must form a word.

Possible words:
- ""UTTER"" - U at 1, T at 3 (duplicate T)
- ""STEER"" - S at 1, E at 3 (duplicate E)
- ""DETER"" - D at 1, E at 3? But ""DETER"" is D E T E R -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.
- ""PETER"" - P E T E R -> position 2 E, not T.
- ""SKEET"" not ending with R.
- ""SWEER"" not common.
- ""FREER"" F R E E R -> position 2 is R, not T. Invalid.
- ""GREET"" not ending with R.
- ""KNEEL"" not.
- ""QUEER"" position 2 U, not T.
- ""SUPER"" position 2 U, not T.
- ""TWIER"" not common.
- ""VIEWR"" not a word.

So only ""UTTER"" and ""STEER"" seem common.

""UTTER"" uses U and tests duplicate T.

""STEER"" uses S and tests duplicate E.

We can choose ""UTTER"" because U is a vowel and might be more likely? Or S is common.

But let's see the feedback from guess 2: BERYL had E at 2 and it was wrong position, but that doesn't prevent E at 3.

Similarly, no feedback on U.

I think both are possible.

But we have to guess one.

Perhaps ""UTTER"" is better because it tests a new vowel U.

Or ""STEER"" tests S, a common consonant.

But in ""STEER"", if we guess it, and if E is not duplicated, we might get E at 3 marked as absent or wrong position? But E is in the word at 4, so if there is no duplicate, E at 3 would be marked as absent? Or if present but wrong position? But E is at 4, so if position 3 is not E, then E at 3 would be marked as absent if no duplicate.

But we don't know.

Similarly for T in ""UTTER"".

To be safe, let's guess ""UTTER"".

So I'll go with that.

</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
     - Absent letters: C, A, N  
     - R and E are present but misplaced (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
   - **Guess 2 (BERYL)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)  
     - Absent letters: B, Y, L  
     - E and R are present but misplaced (E not in position 2, R not in position 3).
   - **Guess 3 (TIMER)**: T(-), I(x), M(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
     - Absent letters: I, M  
     - E and R are correct at positions 4 and 5 (so the word ends with ""ER"").  
     - T is present but not in position 1.
   - **Guess 4 (OTHER)**: O(x), T(✓), H(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
     - Absent letters: O, H  
     - T is correct at position 2, E at 4, R at 5 (so the word pattern is `_ T _ E R`).  
     - O and H are absent.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - **Fixed positions**: Position 2 is T, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. The word structure is `_ T _ E R`.
   - **Absent letters**: A, B, C, H, I, L, M, N, O, Y (all ruled out from feedback).
   - **Present letters to include**: T, E, R are confirmed (with E and R fixed at positions 4–5, and T fixed at position 2). No new letters are confirmed beyond these, but we must fill positions 1 and 3.
   - **Constraints**:
     - Position 1 cannot be T (from Guess 3 feedback: T not in position 1).
     - Position 3 cannot reuse E or R (since duplicates are possible but not confirmed; we need to test new letters).
     - Available letters for positions 1 and 3: D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W, and less common letters like J, K, Q, X, Z (but prioritize common English letters).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - **Goal**: Solve the word by testing likely letters for positions 1 and 3, while maximizing information if the guess is incorrect.
   - **Pattern**: `_ T _ E R` (e.g., words like ""UTTER"" or ""STEER"").
   - **Prioritize common words**: Focus on high-frequency letters (e.g., S, U, P, D) to cover likely candidates.
   - **Key candidate**: ""UTTER"" fits the pattern perfectly:
     - Position 1: U (common vowel, not tested yet).
     - Position 3: T (tests for duplicate T, which is possible based on Wordle rules).
     - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on U and the duplicate T will reveal the solution.
   - **Why not other words?** 
     - ""STEER"" (S at position 1, E at position 3) is possible but tests E duplication, which is less likely given E is fixed at position 4 and hasn't shown duplication hints. It also wastes a chance to test U.
     - ""DETER"" or ""PETER"" are invalid (position 2 must be T, not E).
     - U is a strong choice for position 1 (common in words like ""UTTER""), and testing T at position 3 efficiently checks for duplicates.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If ""UTTER"" is correct, feedback will show all ✓.
   - If incorrect:
     - U(x) would mean position 1 is not U (pointing to S, P, or D).
     - T(-) at position 3 would mean T is not duplicated (so position 3 must be a different letter, like S or P).
     - Feedback will directly identify the solution with 1–2 more guesses.

<guess>UTTER</guess>",UTTER,"We have the feedback from Guess 4: OTHER -> O(x) T(✓) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)
This means:
- O is absent (x)
- T is correct and in the right position (position 2) (✓)
- H is absent (x)
- E is correct (position 4) (✓)
- R is correct (position 5) (✓)

So now we know:
- The word has T in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5. So the word is: _ T _ E R
- O and H are absent (so we add them to the absent list)
- Previously absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y (from guesses 1, 2, 3)
- Now adding O and H to absent: so absent letters: A, B, C, H, I, L, M, N, O, Y

We also know from previous feedback:
- E is not in position 5 (from guess 1) but now we have it at 4, so that's consistent.
- R is not in position 2 or 3 (from guess 1 and 2) but now at 5, which is correct.

Now, the word structure: _ T _ E R

We need to find the first and third letters.

Available letters (not absent): D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others, but common ones: D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W)

We must avoid the absent letters.

Also, from guess 3 (TIMER): T was present but not in position 1, which is consistent because now we have T at 2.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ T _ E R and uses available letters.

Possible words:
- We need to fill position 1 and 3 with available letters.

Common words:
- ""UTTER"" - but U is available? Yes, and T is at 2, then T at 3? But we have to check if duplicate T is allowed? It might be, but let's see.
  - ""UTTER"": positions: 1:U, 2:T, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but position 3 is T, which is the same as position 2? So duplicate T.
- ""OTTER"" - but O is absent? O(x) from this guess, so O cannot be used. So invalid.
- ""AFTER"" - A absent.
- ""ENTER"" - E at position 1? But E is at 4, and we don't know about duplicates. But N absent? N(x) from guess 1. Also, E at 1: we have no feedback that E cannot be at 1, but in guess 2, E was at 2 and wrong, and in guess 1 at 5 and wrong. So E at 1 might be possible? But ""ENTER"" has E at 1 and 4? Duplicate E? And N absent, so invalid.
- ""UTTER"" is a possibility, but let's see if there are others without duplicates.

Another word: ""UTTER"" is one option.

But we can also consider ""APTER"" but A and P? A absent.

""UTTER"" seems like a candidate.

But let's see if there is a word with different letters.

For example, ""STVER"" not a word.

""STYER"" Y absent.

""PTER"" not 5 letters.

""ATER"" A absent.

So, common words: ""UTTER"" and perhaps ""DATER"" but A absent.

""FEWER"" but F E W E R -> positions: 1:F, 2:E, but we need T at 2? We have T fixed at 2, so position 2 must be T. So ""FEWER"" has E at 2, which is not T. So invalid.

Similarly, any word must have T at position 2.

So pattern: [letter] T [letter] E R

With available letters for position 1 and 3.

Position 1: can be D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W, etc.

Position 3: same, but must form a word.

Possible words:
- ""UTTER"" - U at 1, T at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So U and T (duplicate).
- ""DETER"" - D E T E R -> but position 2 is E? We need T at 2. So invalid.
- ""PETER"" - P E T E R -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.
- ""SOWER"" - S O W E R -> O absent? O(x) from this guess. Invalid.
- ""SUPER"" - S U P E R -> position 2 is U, not T. Invalid.
- ""TAMER"" - T A M E R -> A and M absent, and position 1 is T? But we have T at 2, so position 1 cannot be T? We don't know, but T is at 2, so position 1 could be T? But we have T at 2 fixed, so if position 1 is T, that's duplicate. But ""TAMER"" has T at 1 and 2? Not, ""TAMER"" is T A M E R, so position 1: T, 2: A, but we need position 2 to be T, so not.

We need position 2 to be T, so the word must have T at 2.

So ""UTTER"" is a valid word: U T T E R.

Another possibility: ""BUTTER"" is 6 letters.

""UTTER"" is 5 letters.

""ETTER"" not a word? Or ""UTTER"" is the main one.

""UTERI"" not, that's 5 but ends with I, not R.

So ""UTTER"" seems the most common.

But we have position 3 to fill, and in ""UTTER"" it's T.

Another word: ""APTER"" not.

""OXTER"" but O absent.

""FUTER"" not common.

""JUTER"" not common.

""VUTER"" not a word.

So ""UTTER"" is a common word that fits.

We can also consider ""DATER"" but A absent.

So I think ""UTTER"" is the word to guess.

But let's see if there are other options.

""STERN"" but N absent and position 2 is T? ""STERN"" is S T E R N -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:R, 5:N -> but we need E at 4 and R at 5? Here E at 3 and R at 4, N at 5? Not matching.

""STEER"" S T E E R -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R -> but we have E at 4? Here position 4 is E, and R at 5, so that matches? But position 3 is E, which might be duplicate? And we need to check if E can be at 3? We have no feedback against E at 3.

But ""STEER"" has E at 3 and 4? So duplicate E.

And S is available.

But we have the pattern: _ T _ E R, so for ""STEER"": position 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R -> so position 3 is E, which is a vowel.

But we don't know if E is duplicated.

Similarly, ""SHEER"" but H absent? H(x) from this guess.

""SWEER"" not common.

""STEER"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""SKEER"" not common.

""QUEER"" Q U E E R -> position 2 is U, not T. Invalid.

So ""STEER"" is another possibility.

But in ""STEER"", position 3 is E, which is a vowel, and we have E at 4.

Now, we have two candidates: ""UTTER"" and ""STEER"".

But ""UTTER"" has U at 1 and T at 3, while ""STEER"" has S at 1 and E at 3.

We need to choose one to guess.

Since we have limited guesses, we can pick one that tests new letters.

In ""UTTER"", we test U and the possibility of duplicate T.

In ""STEER"", we test S and the possibility of duplicate E.

But we know E is at 4, and we don't know if it can be duplicated? Similarly for T.

But from feedback, we have no duplicate letters so far, so it might be single.

But we have to consider.

Another word: ""DIVER"" D I V E R -> but I absent? I(x) from TIMER.

""GIVER"" G I V E R -> I absent.

""LIVER"" L absent.

""RIVER"" R I V E R -> I absent and duplicate R? R at 1 and 5? But we have R at 5 fixed, so duplicate possible? But I absent.

""WIVER"" not common.

""SEVER"" S E V E R -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.

""PURE"" not 5 letters.

""PUTER"" not common, but P U T E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but we need position 2 to be T? Here position 2 is U, not T. So invalid.

We need position 2 to be T.

So back to ""UTTER"" and ""STEER"".

""STEER"" has position 2 as T? Yes, S T E E R, so position 2 is T.

Position 1: S, position 3: E.

But E is at position 3, which is not 4, so it might be a different E? Or duplicate.

Similarly, ""UTTER"" has U at 1 and T at 3.

Now, U and S are both available.

We can choose ""UTTER"" to test the duplicate T possibility.

Or ""STEER"" for duplicate E.

But let's see the feedback from guess 4: we have T at 2 correct, so the word has T at 2.

If we guess ""UTTER"", and if the word is ""UTTER"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on U and the duplicate T.

Similarly for ""STEER"".

But there might be other words.

Another word: ""DETER"" but position 2 is E, not T.

""TERRY"" not, ends with Y.

""TERSE"" T E R S E -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.

""TUNER"" T U N E R -> but N absent? N(x) from guess 1. And position 1 is T? But we have T at 2, so if position 1 is T, duplicate? ""TUNER"" has T at 1 and 2? Not, ""TUNER"" is T U N E R, so position 1:T, 2:U, but we need position 2 to be T, so not.

We need position 2 to be T, so the first letter can be any except T? Or duplicate? But in ""UTTER"", position 1 is U, not T.

So position 1 is not T, because if it were T, then in ""TIMER"" when we had T at 1, it was marked as present but wrong position, but now we know T is at 2, so position 1 cannot be T? Because if position 1 were T, then in ""TIMER"" (guess 3) T at 1 should have been correct? But it was marked as T(-), meaning present but wrong position, so T is not at position 1. Therefore, position 1 cannot be T. So no duplicate T at position 1.

Similarly, in the word, T is only at position 2? Or could be elsewhere? We don't know.

But in ""UTTER"", if we have T at 2 and T at 3, that's possible.

Similarly, in ""STEER"", T at 2 and E at 3 and 4.

But for position 1, it cannot be T.

So for ""UTTER"", position 1 is U, which is not T.

Now, let's list all possible words that fit _ T _ E R with available letters.

Available letters for position 1: D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W (and others like K, but less common)

For position 3: same, but must form a word.

Possible words:
- ""UTTER"" - U at 1, T at 3 (duplicate T)
- ""STEER"" - S at 1, E at 3 (duplicate E)
- ""DETER"" - D at 1, E at 3? But ""DETER"" is D E T E R -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.
- ""PETER"" - P E T E R -> position 2 E, not T.
- ""SKEET"" not ending with R.
- ""SWEER"" not common.
- ""FREER"" F R E E R -> position 2 is R, not T. Invalid.
- ""GREET"" not ending with R.
- ""KNEEL"" not.
- ""QUEER"" position 2 U, not T.
- ""SUPER"" position 2 U, not T.
- ""TWIER"" not common.
- ""VIEWR"" not a word.

So only ""UTTER"" and ""STEER"" seem common.

""UTTER"" uses U and tests duplicate T.

""STEER"" uses S and tests duplicate E.

We can choose ""UTTER"" because U is a vowel and might be more likely? Or S is common.

But let's see the feedback from guess 2: BERYL had E at 2 and it was wrong position, but that doesn't prevent E at 3.

Similarly, no feedback on U.

I think both are possible.

But we have to guess one.

Perhaps ""UTTER"" is better because it tests a new vowel U.

Or ""STEER"" tests S, a common consonant.

But in ""STEER"", if we guess it, and if E is not duplicated, we might get E at 3 marked as absent or wrong position? But E is in the word at 4, so if there is no duplicate, E at 3 would be marked as absent? Or if present but wrong position? But E is at 4, so if position 3 is not E, then E at 3 would be marked as absent if no duplicate.

But we don't know.

Similarly for T in ""UTTER"".

To be safe, let's guess ""UTTER"".

So I'll go with that.

<guess>UTTER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
     - Absent letters: C, A, N  
     - R and E are present but misplaced (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
   - **Guess 2 (BERYL)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)  
     - Absent letters: B, Y, L  
     - E and R are present but misplaced (E not in position 2, R not in position 3).
   - **Guess 3 (TIMER)**: T(-), I(x), M(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
     - Absent letters: I, M  
     - E and R are correct at positions 4 and 5 (so the word ends with ""ER"").  
     - T is present but not in position 1.
   - **Guess 4 (OTHER)**: O(x), T(✓), H(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
     - Absent letters: O, H  
     - T is correct at position 2, E at 4, R at 5 (so the word pattern is `_ T _ E R`).  
     - O and H are absent.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - **Fixed positions**: Position 2 is T, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. The word structure is `_ T _ E R`.
   - **Absent letters**: A, B, C, H, I, L, M, N, O, Y (all ruled out from feedback).
   - **Present letters to include**: T, E, R are confirmed (with E and R fixed at positions 4–5, and T fixed at position 2). No new letters are confirmed beyond these, but we must fill positions 1 and 3.
   - **Constraints**:
     - Position 1 cannot be T (from Guess 3 feedback: T not in position 1).
     - Position 3 cannot reuse E or R (since duplicates are possible but not confirmed; we need to test new letters).
     - Available letters for positions 1 and 3: D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W, and less common letters like J, K, Q, X, Z (but prioritize common English letters).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - **Goal**: Solve the word by testing likely letters for positions 1 and 3, while maximizing information if the guess is incorrect.
   - **Pattern**: `_ T _ E R` (e.g., words like ""UTTER"" or ""STEER"").
   - **Prioritize common words**: Focus on high-frequency letters (e.g., S, U, P, D) to cover likely candidates.
   - **Key candidate**: ""UTTER"" fits the pattern perfectly:
     - Position 1: U (common vowel, not tested yet).
     - Position 3: T (tests for duplicate T, which is possible based on Wordle rules).
     - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on U and the duplicate T will reveal the solution.
   - **Why not other words?** 
     - ""STEER"" (S at position 1, E at position 3) is possible but tests E duplication, which is less likely given E is fixed at position 4 and hasn't shown duplication hints. It also wastes a chance to test U.
     - ""DETER"" or ""PETER"" are invalid (position 2 must be T, not E).
     - U is a strong choice for position 1 (common in words like ""UTTER""), and testing T at position 3 efficiently checks for duplicates.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If ""UTTER"" is correct, feedback will show all ✓.
   - If incorrect:
     - U(x) would mean position 1 is not U (pointing to S, P, or D).
     - T(-) at position 3 would mean T is not duplicated (so position 3 must be a different letter, like S or P).
     - Feedback will directly identify the solution with 1–2 more guesses.",Guess 5: UTTER -> FEEDBACK: U(x) T(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's start with my first guess. Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a word that maximizes the amount of useful information I can get. This means selecting a word with common letters that might appear in many 5-letter English words.

I recall that many Wordle players start with words that contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. Vowels are crucial because almost every English word has at least one vowel. Among consonants, letters like R, S, T, L, and N appear frequently.

Considering this, a good starting word might be something like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another option is ""ROAST"". After thinking about it, ""CRANE"" seems solid because:

- It includes two vowels: A and E.
- Common consonants: C, R, N.

The vowel distribution seems good—E is the most common English letter, and A is also very frequent. Consonants like C, R, N are also quite common.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" could be another excellent choice due to the combination of S, L, A, T, E—all very common letters. But I decide to go with ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

So, I'll start by guessing ""CRANE"".I need to make a first guess with no prior information. A strong opener should use common letters to maximize feedback potential. Ideal starting words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T, L, N).  

""CRANE"" is an effective choice because:  
- It covers three vowels (A, E) and useful consonants (C, R, N).  
- Tests positions for high-frequency letters to narrow down possibilities faster.  
- Often recommended in strategy guides for optimal information gain.  

This guess will reveal:  
- Which letters exist/missing via ✓/-/x symbols.  
- Positional accuracy for 5 distinct letters.

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>Alright, let's analyze the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 

- C(x): Not in the word at all.  
- R(-): R is in the word but in the wrong position.  
- A(x): Not in the word.  
- N(x): Not in the word.  
- E(-): E is in the word but wrong position.  

So, we know:  
1. **R** and **E** are definitely in the secret word, just not at positions 2 and 5 (since feedback shows wrong position).  
2. **C, A, N** are completely absent.  

Constraints for the next guess:  
- Must include R and E.  
- Exclude C, A, N.  
- Positions: R cannot be in spot 2 (tried there originally), E cannot be in spot 5.  

Since R and E exist, I should prioritize placing them in new positions. Possible slots for R: 1,3,4,5 (since position 2 was wrong). Possible slots for E: 1,2,3,4 (position 5 was wrong).  

Need a word with:  
- R in positions 1,3,4, or 5.  
- E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.  
- Avoid C,A,N entirely.  

Good candidate letters to test: Other common consonants like S,T,L,P,D,M since vowels A is out, so focus on remaining vowels (O,I,U) or consonants.  

Possible words:  
- Could try **RESET**? No—E repeated, and we risk duplicate letter issues. Better avoid duplicates for now.  
- **TRIBE**: Has R (position 1), E (position 5). But position 5 was originally E(-), meaning E isn't at end—so placing E at position 5 again would likely still be wrong. R at position 1 is new—could be correct?  
- **PERCH**: Has P,E,R,C... Wait, C is out—invalid.  
- **SERUM**: Has S,E,R,U,M—all new letters except E/R. Positions: R at 3, E at 2.  
  - Feedback told us E isn't at position 5, but position 2 might work; same for R not at 2—so position 3 for R is fresh.  

Other options: **ROUSE**? Has R,O,U,S,E. Positions: R(1), E(5)—but original feedback had E(-) at position 5, so E shouldn't be at end. Risk rechecking E at 5.  

Better to avoid reusing the position E was wrong in. Since E couldn't be at spot 5, placing it elsewhere—like **SERUM** (E at spot 2) or **BREAD** (R at 3, E at 4—E at 4 avoids position 5).  

**BREAD** might be strong:  
- B,R,E,A,D. But A is out! A was x in first guess → banned. So invalid.  

Revised: **PRIDE**? Has P,R,I,D,E.  
- Positions: R(2)—but R was tried at position 2 originally and was marked wrong (-), so placing R at position 2 again likely still wrong. Avoid reused positions for known letters.  

Best candidates:  
- **SPIRE**: R at 4, E at 5—but E at 5 was wrong before, so probably still wrong.  
- **RODEO**: Has R,O,D,E,O—E at position 4. Avoids reused spots: R at position 1 (new), E at position 4 (new). Also tests O and D.  

But **RODEO** has duplicate O—might reduce information. Prefer all distinct letters.  

**SOLVE**? Has S,O,L,V,E—E at position 5 → same issue. Avoid position 5 for E.  

**STRIDE**: S,T,R,I,D,E.  
- Positions: R(3), E(6)—wait, only 5 letters. **STRIP**? No E needed. Must include E.  

**SHIRE**? E at 5 again—no.  

Better: **MERCY**? But C is out—forbidden.  

**BERYL**? B,E,R,Y,L. Positions: R at 3, E at 2—both new slots. Letters: Tests B,Y,L.  

Key points:  
- Secret word has R and E, positions unknown but not index 2 for R and not index 5 for E.  
- Must exclude C,A,N.  

**BERYL** seems valid:  
- E at position 2 → originally untested for E (since E was at 5 before).  
- R at position 3 → originally R was at 2, so position 3 is new.  
- Tests B,Y,L—new letters.  

Alternative: **PERKY**—but K new, but E at position 4 avoids previous error slots.  

However, **BERYL** is a gemstone—valid English word. Solid choice to test R and E in new contexts while introducing fresh consonants.  

Decision: Next guess → **BERYL**.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.  
- **R(-)**: R is in the word, but not in position 2.  
- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.  
- **N(x)**: N is not in the word.  
- **E(-)**: E is in the word, but not in position 5.  

Key insights:  
1. **R** and **E** are confirmed present but misplaced.  
2. **C, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.  
3. R cannot be in position 2 (tried incorrectly), and E cannot be in position 5 (tried incorrectly).  

For the next guess:  
4. Must include **R** and **E** in *new positions*. Ideal positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is ruled out). For E: 1–4 (position 5 ruled out).  
5. Should introduce common unused letters like **S, T, L, B, P, D, M**, or vowels **O, I, U**, while avoiding C, A, N.  
6. Prioritize words with distinct letters to maximize information.  

A strong candidate is **BERYL**:  
- Tests **R** in position 3 (new position)  
- Tests **E** in position 2 (new position)  
- Introduces new letters: **B, Y, L** (common consonants and vowel-like Y)  
- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N) and reused positions for R/E.  

This guess optimally narrows possibilities for the secret word.

<guess>BERYL</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback:

First guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Second guess ""BERYL"": B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)

From the first guess, we know:
- R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- C, A, N are not in the word.

From the second guess:
- B(x): B is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 2 (since in BERYL, E was in position 2).
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since in BERYL, R was in position 3).
- Y(x): Y is not in the word.
- L(x): L is not in the word.

Now, combining the information:
- Letters confirmed in the word: R, E.
- Letters ruled out: C, A, N, B, Y, L.
- Position constraints:
  - R is not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from BERYL). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - E is not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from BERYL). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

Because the word has 5 letters and we know only R and E must be included, we need to find a word that contains R and E, and three more letters that have not been ruled out.

Ruled out letters: A, B, C, L, N, Y. So available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.

We also know the secret word must be composed of only these available letters plus R and E.

Possible positions for R: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions for E: 1, 3, 4

Note that R and E might occupy the same position? But no, because each position can only have one letter. Also, they are two distinct letters unless the word has duplicates? But we don't know yet. But from the feedback, since we got two (probably) distinct letters, we assume they are different.

Now, we have to form a word that respects:
- Includes R and E at positions that are consistent with the exclusions.
- Does not include any ruled out letters.

Moreover, we must avoid the positions where they were misplaced.

Let me think of words that have R and E, and try to assign positions.

Possible positions:

Case 1: R at position 1.
Then E can be at 3 or 4 (not at 1 because same position, and not at 2 or 5).

So if R is at 1, then E at 3 or 4.

Similarly, if R at 4, then E at 1 or 3 (since E cannot be at 4 same as R? Wait, position 4 would have E and R? No, same position cannot have two letters. So when R is at 4, E cannot be at 4).

Similarly, R at 5: E at 1 or 3.

We also need to fill the other positions with letters that aren't excluded.

Since we have limited tries, we want a word that tests new common letters and further constraints.

Let's list possible words.

Common words with R and E:

Think of words where R is in position 1: e.g., ""RE..."". Then E must be at 3 or 4.

Examples:
- ""RESET"" has duplicate E, and S and T allowed? But E is at position 2 and 5? Not allowed: E cannot be at 5 and also we have E at 2 in second guess? But feedback: E(-) at position 2 meaning wrong position, so E might be at other positions but we know E cannot be at 2 in this word? Wait.

Actually, ""RESET"" has E at 2 and 5. Position 2 we know E is not correct there from second guess? Yes, but E can be at 5? Wait, no: first guess had E at 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at 5. Similarly, in second guess E at 2 wrong. So ""RESET"" would place E at 2 and 5, both forbidden positions? So invalid.

Another one: ""RIPER"" → has R at 1 and E at 4? And positions: 
Position 1: R (known to be acceptable location? but not confirmed if correct)
Position 2: I
Position 3: P
Position 4: E
Position 5: R? But now E is in position 4: which is allowed? Yes, because E was not ruled out for position 4. And R at position 4? Wait, ""RIPER"" has two R's? And R at position 5: but position 5 is allowed? R can be at 5? Since we only have position constraints for R: cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

But let's check: the word must have at least one R and one E. But ""RIPER"" has R at three positions? Not efficient but possible.

Moreover, in the first guess, we had E at 5 which was wrong, so the secret word might have E at 4. Similarly R at 4 or elsewhere.

But multiple R's? Possible? The rules don't forbid duplicate letters.

However, in feedback, if a letter is duplicated, it can complicate. For simplicity, maybe avoid duplicates for now.

But considering: if there is duplicate, the feedback might mark multiples. But for now, let's assume we prefer distinct letters if possible.

Another idea: use a word with R and E and test new common consonants.

For example, S, T, P, etc.

Possible word: ""ROGUE"". But O and U: not excluded. R at 1, E at 5? E is at 5? But first guess: E cannot be at 5. So not.

Word: ""RIFLE""? But F and L? But L is ruled out: from second guess, L(x), so L not in word. So no.

""RIDER"" - R at 1, D, then E at 4? R and D: but R at 5? Duplicate R.

Perhaps ""RISEN""? But S and N? N ruled out? First guess: N(x), so not allowed.

Since A, N, C, B, L, Y are out, available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.

Try R at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""R_ E _ _"". Like:

- ""RIPER"" but duplicate R? Or non-distinct.
- ""RIVER"": R at 1, I, V, E at 4? Wait, E at 4? But position: ""RIVER"" has positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? E is at position 4? Which is allowed? E can be at position 4. But R at 1 and 5: which R at 5 is possible? R can be at 1,4,5? So 5 is allowed? Maybe.

But R at 5: we have constraint R not at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

Similarly E at 4: not forbidden.

But I is new? V? But we need to test.

Another word: ""RISER"" - R at 1,5, S, E at 4? But S allowed. But similar to above.

But we might get less information due to duplicate.

Alternative: positions R at 4 and E at 1 or 3.

For example, R at position 4: then word ends with _ _ _ R ? 

But E must be at 1 or 3.

If E at 3: "" _ _ E R _""

Like ""PILER""? But L ruled out? L not allowed.

""TIMER"" - T, I, M, E, R? Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:M, 4:E, 5:R? 
But E is at position 4? Which is allowed? And R at position 5? Also allowed? T,I,M are not ruled out.

And E at position 4: from feedback, E cannot be at 2 or 5, so 4 or others? E can be at 4.

Similarly, R at 5? R cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.

Also, T,I,M new letters.

Similarly, is ""TIMER"" valid? Yes, meaning a device that times.

But let's confirm constraints:
- R: position 5, not 2 or 3 -> allowed.
- E: position 4? But in the secret word, E must be placed at a new position? We haven't tested position 4 for E, so it's fine.

Similarly, R at position 5: we tried R at position 2 and 3? In CRANE, R at 2; in BERYL, R at 3. So position 5 is new and allowed.

Similarly E at 4: never tested, so possible.

But we have another possibility: R at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we skip position 3? 

For example: ""R _ _ E _"" 

With the middle three positions letters from allowed set.

Word: ""ROUGE""? E at 5? Not allowed.

""ROUSE"" E at 5? Not.

""RANGE"" G and E at 5? E at 5? Not allowed.

""RIPEN"" N ruled out? Not.

So perhaps ""RIPER"" but duplicate? Or ""RIVER"" which we considered.

But ""RIVER"" has E at position 4? And R at 5? And V and I? Available.

But let's compare: ""TIMER"" tests T,I,M,E,R with E at 4 and R at 5.

It avoids duplicate letters.

Similarly, ""TIMER"" uses common letters.

Another option: ""PORES"" P,O,R,E,S? R at position 3? But R cannot be at 3? Because second guess had R at 3 and it was wrong! So if R at position 3, it would be incorrect. Thus ""PORES"" has R at 3, which is forbidden? No: the constraint is that R cannot be at 3? Because in BERYL, R was at 3 and feedback was R(-), meaning R is not in position 3. So we cannot put R at position 3. Similarly, position 2 was wrong.

Therefore in ""TIMER"", R is at 5, which is new and allowed.

Similarly E at 4, also allowed.

Also, the word doesn't have any ruled out letters: T, I, M are possible.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TIMER"".

But let's see if there's a better one: another word might be ""HOMER""? But O and H? E at 4? R at 5? Also possible? But we get less common letters? Slightly less frequent.

""OFFER""? But duplicate F? And F? But E at 4? R at 5? O,F,F? Duplicate.

""TIMER"" seems solid.

So next guess: ""TIMER""

But to confirm:
- T: new
- I: new
- M: new
- E: now placed at position 4, which is new.
- R: at position 5, new.

Hoping to get ✓ on E or R, or identify correct letters.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, B, Y, L (from ""CRANE"" and ""BERYL"" feedback).
- **Confirmed present letters**: R and E.
- **Position constraints**:
  - R cannot be in position 2 (from ""CRANE"" R(-)) or position 3 (from ""BERYL"" R(-)), so R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.
  - E cannot be in position 2 (from ""BERYL"" E(-)) or position 5 (from ""CRANE"" E(-)), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E in new positions that respect the constraints (avoiding positions 2 and 3 for R, and positions 2 and 5 for E).
- Use only available letters (not excluded), such as D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.
- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information and avoid duplicates for clarity.

After evaluating options, ""TIMER"" fits well:
- R is in position 5 (allowed).
- E is in position 4 (allowed).
- Tests new common consonants T, M, and vowel I.
- Avoids excluded letters and duplicate letters.

<guess>TIMER</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)
Guess 3: TIMER -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
  - C, A, N are absent.
  - R is present but not in position 2.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: BERYL -> B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)
  - B, Y, L are absent.
  - E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked wrong).
  - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong).

Guess 3: TIMER -> T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)
  - T is present but not in position 1.
  - I and M are absent.
  - E is correct at position 4 (so the 4th letter is E).
  - R is correct at position 5 (so the 5th letter is R).

So, we know:
- The word has E in the 4th position and R in the 5th position. So the word ends with ""ER"".
- Additionally, we have T present in the word, but not in position 1 (since in TIMER it was in position 1 and marked as wrong position).
- We have R and E confirmed from the start, and now we know their exact positions: 4 and 5.

Also, from the first two guesses, we know that R is not in position 2 or 3, and E is not in position 2 or 5 (but now we know E is in 4, so that's consistent). Also, R is now fixed at 5.

Now, the word structure: _ _ _ E R

We know T is in the word but not in position 1. So T must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, we have a list of absent letters: C, A, N, B, Y, L, I, M.

So absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y.

Therefore, available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and possibly others, but we know T is present.

Since T is present and must be in position 2 or 3, we can consider words of the form:
- If T is in position 2: _ T _ E R
- If T is in position 3: _ _ T E R

We also need to fill the first and the third (or second) position with available letters, and the word must be a valid English word.

Moreover, we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on the 4th guess), so we want to maximize information.

But we also have two positions to figure out: positions 1 and either 2 or 3 (depending on where T is). Actually, we don't know which of the two positions T is in.

We can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 and tests a common letter for position 1 and 3, or vice versa.

Alternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.

But note: we have only two unknown positions? Actually, no: the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know 4 and 5 (E and R). So we need positions 1,2,3.

But we know T is in the word and must be in either 2 or 3. So one of position 2 or 3 is T, and the other is another letter, and position 1 is another letter.

So we have three positions to determine, but with the constraint that T is in one of 2 or 3.

We can think of two cases:

Case 1: T in position 2 -> word: _ T _ E R
Case 2: T in position 3 -> word: _ _ T E R

We need to find words that fit one of these patterns and use only available letters.

Available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and we know T is used.

Common letters left: S, T, O, P, D, etc.

We can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 and tests a vowel for position 1 and a consonant for 3, or vice versa.

But we also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's list possible words for each case.

First, for Case 1: _ T _ E R
Possible words:
- After T, the third letter must be a vowel or consonant that can form a word. Common words: 
  - ""OTTER"" -> but T is repeated? And O in position 1. But we have T in position 2 and 3? But we need position 3 to be a letter, then E R. ""OTTER"" has two T's? Then it would be O T T E R. But position 3 is T? Then we have T in position 2 and 3? But we know T is only one? Not necessarily, but we don't know. However, in feedback, for TIMER, T was present but wrong position, so it could be that there is only one T? But it might be duplicated? We don't know.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

So without duplicates: 
- ""UTTER"" -> again duplicate T? U T T E R -> same.
- ""STYER"" -> but Y is absent? Y is ruled out (from BERYL: Y(x)).
- ""STOER""? Not a word? 
- ""STOER"" might not be common. 
- ""ATER""? But A is absent.

Better: ""OTTER"" is a word, but duplicate T.

""AFTER""? But A is absent.

""OUTER""? O U T E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but this is for Case 2? No, for Case 1 we need T in position 2.

For Case 1: _ T _ E R
- Position 1: any available letter except absent ones.
- Position 3: any available letter.

Examples:
- ""STYER"" invalid because Y absent.
- ""PTER"" is not 5 letters? We need 5 letters.

""OTTER"": O T T E R -> but position 3 is T, so it has two T's. But we don't know if T is duplicated? It could be.

But let's see: in TIMER, we had T in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one T in the word, but it could be more. However, the feedback doesn't tell us if there are duplicates. So we have to consider.

But for now, let's avoid if possible.

Another word: ""UTTER"" same issue.

""AFTER"" A absent.

""ENTER"" E in position 1? But we have E already at 4, and E might be duplicated? But in first guess, E was present but not at 5, and now we have E at 4. But we don't know if there is another E? The feedback doesn't show duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter is duplicated, the feedback might be tricky. For example, if the word has one E and you guess two, one might be marked as absent.

But in our case, we haven't guessed duplicates yet.

Perhaps we can try a word without duplicates for Case 1.

What about ""OTHER""? O T H E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:T, 3:H, 4:E, 5:R -> this fits Case 1: T in position 2.

And H is available? H not ruled out.

Similarly, ""OTTER"" has duplicate T, but ""OTHER"" does not.

""OTHER"" is a valid word.

Now, for Case 2: _ _ T E R
Examples:
- ""CATER"" but C and A absent.
- ""DATER"" A absent.
- ""HATER"" A absent.
- ""LATER"" A and L absent? L is absent.
- ""MATER"" M absent? M is absent from TIMER: M(x).
- ""PATER"" P A T E R -> A absent.
- ""RATER"" R at position 1? But we have R at 5, and R might be duplicated? But we don't know. Also, in ""RATER"", R is at 1 and 5? But position 1: R, then A absent? A is absent.

Another: ""WATER"" A absent.

""SOBER"" but B absent? B is absent from BERYL: B(x).

""COVER"" C absent.

""POKER"" P O K E R -> K is available? K not ruled out.

""POKER"" is a word: positions 1:P, 2:O, 3:K, 4:E, 5:R.

Similarly, ""POWER"" O W E R -> but then position 3: W? ""POWER"" is P O W E R.

""TOWER"" T O W E R -> but T is in position 1? But we are in Case 2, which is T in position 3? ""TOWER"" has T in position 1, not 3.

For Case 2, we need T in position 3: so _ _ T E R.

So ""POKER"" has K? And P and O.

""POSER"" P O S E R -> S is available.

""POSER"" is a word: P O S E R.

Similarly, ""DOPER"" D O P E R -> but P and D? ""DOPER"" might not be common? But valid.

""DOSER"" D O S E R.

But we also have T to place? In Case 2, T is in position 3, so the word must have T at 3.

So for Case 2: _ _ T E R

Examples:
- ""BITER"" B absent.
- ""CITER"" C absent.
- ""DITER"" not a word.
- ""FIGHTER"" too long.
- ""HITTER"" H I T T E R -> duplicate T? And I absent? I is absent from TIMER: I(x).
- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but that's 5 letters? L I T R E, positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4 and R at 5? Here R is at 4 and E at 5? Not matching.

We need the pattern to have E at 4 and R at 5, so the last two are fixed as ER.

So for Case 2: positions: 1,2,3=T,4=E,5=R? No: position 3 is T, then 4=E, 5=R.

So the word is: ? ? T E R

Examples:
- ""MITER"" M absent? M(x) from TIMER.
- ""NITER"" N absent.
- ""PETER"" P E T E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but E at 2 and 4? But we have E at 4, and E might be duplicated? But in this case, position 2 is E? But we know E cannot be at position 2 from BERYL feedback? BERYL had E at 2 and it was wrong position, so E is not at 2. So ""PETER"" would have E at 2, which is forbidden.

Similarly, ""RUTER"" R U T E R -> R at 1 and 5? But R at 1: we don't know if R is duplicated? But we have R at 5 fixed. Also, U is available.

But ""RUTER"" is not a common word? Router is 6 letters.

""SUPER"" S U P E R -> but no T? We need T at position 3.

""SUPER"" is S U P E R, so position 3 is P, not T.

We need T at 3.

""UTTER"" U T T E R -> but T at 2 and 3? So for Case 2, we need T at 3, but ""UTTER"" has T at 2 and 3? So position 3 is T, but also position 2 is T? So it fits the pattern? The pattern is _ _ T E R, so position 3 is T, but position 2 can be anything? In ""UTTER"", position 1:U, 2:T, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R. So position 3 is T, which is what we want for Case 2? But position 2 is also T? So it has duplicate T.

But the pattern for Case 2 is: position 3 must be T, but position 2 can be T or not? It can be, but we don't know.

Similarly, ""OTTER"" for Case 2: O T T E R -> position 3 is T? Yes, but position 2 is T? So again duplicate.

But we can consider.

Another word: ""AFTER"" A absent.

""ENTER"" E at 1? But E cannot be at 1? We don't know, but E is at 4, and we don't know about duplicates. But in ""ENTER"", E at 1 and 4? Position 1: E, which might be possible? But we have no feedback about E at position 1. However, in the first guess, E was at 5 and wrong, and second guess E at 2 and wrong, but position 1 has not been tested for E. So it could be.

But ""ENTER"" has E at 1 and 4? And T at 3? So for Case 2: _ _ T E R, ""ENTER"" would be E N T E R -> but N is absent? N(x) from CRANE.

So not.

""INTER"" I absent.

""OUTER"" O U T E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> this fits Case 2: T at position 3.

And O and U are available.

""OUTER"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""POKER"" is P O K E R, but no T? Position 3 is K, not T.

For Case 2, we need T at 3.

So ""OUTER"" is a good candidate.

Now, back to our guess: we need to choose a word that can help distinguish between the cases.

But we also know that T must be in position 2 or 3.

We can guess a word that has T in position 2, for example, to test Case 1.

Or one with T in position 3 for Case 2.

But we can also guess a word that has T in one of them and tests the other positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that covers common possibilities.

But we have two main candidates: ""OTHER"" for Case 1 (T in 2) and ""OUTER"" for Case 2 (T in 3).

If we guess ""OTHER"", it tests:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: T (which we suspect might be correct if Case 1)
- Position 3: H

And we know position 4 and 5 are E and R.

Similarly, if we guess ""OUTER"", it tests:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: U
- Position 3: T (for Case 2)

But we don't know which case.

We could guess a word that has T in position 2 and uses a common letter for position 1 and 3, or vice versa.

Another idea: guess a word that has T in position 3 and tests position 1 and 2 with common letters.

But we also have T present, so we must include T.

Let's list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.

First, for Case 1: _ T _ E R
Possible words with available letters (no absent letters):
- ""OTHER"" (O, T, H, E, R)
- ""UTTER"" (U, T, T, E, R) - duplicate T
- ""OTTER"" (O, T, T, E, R) - duplicate T
- ""STVER"" not a word.
- ""STYER"" invalid Y.
- ""PTER"" not 5 letters.
- ""DATER"" A absent.
- So ""OTHER"" is the main one without duplicates.

For Case 2: _ _ T E R
- ""OUTER"" (O, U, T, E, R)
- ""PETER"" (P, E, T, E, R) - but E at 2, which is forbidden (from BERYL, E not at 2)
- ""MITER"" M absent.
- ""NITER"" N absent.
- ""RUTER"" not common, but R U T E R? Might be accepted? But R at 1 and 5? Duplicate R? And U.
- ""SUTER"" not common.
- ""CITER"" C absent.
- ""HITTER"" H I T T E R -> I absent and duplicate T.
- ""JITTER"" too long.
- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but R at 4 and E at 5? Not matching our pattern (we need E at 4, R at 5). ""LITRE"" is L-I-T-R-E, so positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need 4:E and 5:R, so not.
- ""METER"" M absent and E at 2? Forbidden.
- ""POKER"" no T at 3.
- ""POSER"" no T.
- So ""OUTER"" is a good candidate for Case 2.

Also, ""AFTER"" is invalid due to A.

So we have two main possibilities: ""OTHER"" and ""OUTER"".

But ""OTHER"" has T in position 2, and ""OUTER"" has T in position 3.

We can choose one to test.

Since we have T present and we know it's not in 1, it must be in 2 or 3.

If we guess ""OTHER"":
- If T is in position 2, then we might get T(✓) at position 2, and then we know the word is _ T _ E R, and we have O and H to check.
- If T is not in position 2, then we know T must be in position 3 (since it's present), and then we get T(-) for position 2, meaning T is in the word but not at 2, so it must be at 3.

Similarly, if we guess ""OUTER"":
- If T is in position 3, we get T(✓) at 3.
- If not, then T must be in position 2.

But in ""OUTER"", position 3 is T, so if T is in position 3, it will be correct.

But we don't know.

Also, by guessing ""OTHER"", we test O and H.

Similarly, ""OUTER"" tests O and U.

Common letters: O is common, H and U are also common.

But we have no information about O, H, U.

We can choose one.

Another word: what about ""POWER""? But ""POWER"" is P O W E R, so positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But no T? We must include T because it's present. So we cannot guess a word without T.

Similarly, we must include T in the guess.

So we have to have T in the word.

Therefore, between ""OTHER"" and ""OUTER"", both are valid.

Let's see which one gives more information.

If we guess ""OTHER"":
- If we get T(✓) at position 2, then the word is _ T H E R, and we only need position 1. And from feedback, we'll know about O and H.
- If we get T(-) at position 2, then T is not at 2, so it must be at 3, and then the word is _ _ T E R, and we know O and H are not in the word? Not necessarily, but we get feedback on O and H.

Similarly for ""OUTER"".

But we have only two cases, so after this guess, we might solve it.

Since we have E and R fixed, and T must be in 2 or 3, we can also consider guessing a word that has T in position 3 and common letters for 1 and 2.

For example, ""OUTER"" does that.

But let's choose ""OTHER"" as a guess.

Or perhaps ""SHOER"" but S H O E R? But no T? Must include T.

Another word: ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But we know T cannot be in position 1 (from TIMER feedback: T(-) at position 1, so T not at 1). So ""TOWER"" has T at 1, which is forbidden. So invalid.

Similarly, we cannot have T in position 1.

So back to ""OTHER"" or ""OUTER"".

I think ""OTHER"" is a good guess.

So I'll go with ""OTHER"".

Then, based on feedback, we can determine.

But let's see the response format.

We need to output the guess.

So <guess>OTHER</guess>

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""OTHER"", then we get all correct? But we don't know.

If not, we get information.

But we have to make a guess.

Another possibility: the word could be ""UTTER"" or ""OTTER"", but let's try to avoid duplicates first.

So I think ""OTHER"" is fine.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)
     - C, A, N are absent from the word.
     - R is present but not in position 2.
     - E is present but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (BERYL)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)
     - B, Y, L are absent.
     - E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked wrong).
     - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong).
   - **Guess 3 (TIMER)**: T(-), I(x), M(x), E(✓), R(✓)
     - T is present but not in position 1.
     - I and M are absent.
     - E is correct at position 4 (so the 4th letter is E).
     - R is correct at position 5 (so the 5th letter is R).

2. **Key Insights:**
   - The word ends with ""ER"" (positions 4 and 5 are fixed as E and R).
   - T is present but cannot be in position 1 (from TIMER feedback). Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, T must be in position 2 or 3.
   - Absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y (from all feedback).
   - Available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and others not ruled out.
   - Word structure: `_ _ _ E R` (positions 1, 2, 3 unknown, with T in either 2 or 3).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - Must include T (since it's confirmed present) and test its position (2 or 3).
   - Avoid absent letters and reuse E and R in their correct positions (4 and 5) to confirm consistency.
   - Test new common letters (e.g., O, H, U) to gather more information.
   - Prioritize words without duplicates for clearer feedback.
   - Two main candidate patterns:
     - **Case 1**: T in position 2 → `_ T _ E R` (e.g., ""OTHER"").
     - **Case 2**: T in position 3 → `_ _ T E R` (e.g., ""OUTER"").
   - ""OTHER"" is chosen because:
     - It tests T in position 2 (helping resolve the position ambiguity).
     - It introduces new common letters: O (position 1) and H (position 3), which are not ruled out.
     - If T is in position 2, feedback may confirm it (✓) or indicate it's misplaced (-), narrowing T to position 3.
     - Feedback on O and H will help identify the remaining letters.

4. **Expected Outcomes:**
   - If T is in position 2: Feedback may show T(✓) and provide info on O and H.
   - If T is not in position 2: Feedback will show T(-), confirming T must be in position 3, and provide info on O and H for other positions.
   - This guess maximizes information with common letters and avoids duplicates.

<guess>OTHER</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)
Guess 3: TIMER -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 4: OTHER -> FEEDBACK: O(x) T(✓) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from Guess 4: OTHER -> O(x) T(✓) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)
This means:
- O is absent (x)
- T is correct and in the right position (position 2) (✓)
- H is absent (x)
- E is correct (position 4) (✓)
- R is correct (position 5) (✓)

So now we know:
- The word has T in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5. So the word is: _ T _ E R
- O and H are absent (so we add them to the absent list)
- Previously absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y (from guesses 1, 2, 3)
- Now adding O and H to absent: so absent letters: A, B, C, H, I, L, M, N, O, Y

We also know from previous feedback:
- E is not in position 5 (from guess 1) but now we have it at 4, so that's consistent.
- R is not in position 2 or 3 (from guess 1 and 2) but now at 5, which is correct.

Now, the word structure: _ T _ E R

We need to find the first and third letters.

Available letters (not absent): D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others, but common ones: D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W)

We must avoid the absent letters.

Also, from guess 3 (TIMER): T was present but not in position 1, which is consistent because now we have T at 2.

Now, we need to guess a word that fits the pattern _ T _ E R and uses available letters.

Possible words:
- We need to fill position 1 and 3 with available letters.

Common words:
- ""UTTER"" - but U is available? Yes, and T is at 2, then T at 3? But we have to check if duplicate T is allowed? It might be, but let's see.
  - ""UTTER"": positions: 1:U, 2:T, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but position 3 is T, which is the same as position 2? So duplicate T.
- ""OTTER"" - but O is absent? O(x) from this guess, so O cannot be used. So invalid.
- ""AFTER"" - A absent.
- ""ENTER"" - E at position 1? But E is at 4, and we don't know about duplicates. But N absent? N(x) from guess 1. Also, E at 1: we have no feedback that E cannot be at 1, but in guess 2, E was at 2 and wrong, and in guess 1 at 5 and wrong. So E at 1 might be possible? But ""ENTER"" has E at 1 and 4? Duplicate E? And N absent, so invalid.
- ""UTTER"" is a possibility, but let's see if there are others without duplicates.

Another word: ""UTTER"" is one option.

But we can also consider ""APTER"" but A and P? A absent.

""UTTER"" seems like a candidate.

But let's see if there is a word with different letters.

For example, ""STVER"" not a word.

""STYER"" Y absent.

""PTER"" not 5 letters.

""ATER"" A absent.

So, common words: ""UTTER"" and perhaps ""DATER"" but A absent.

""FEWER"" but F E W E R -> positions: 1:F, 2:E, but we need T at 2? We have T fixed at 2, so position 2 must be T. So ""FEWER"" has E at 2, which is not T. So invalid.

Similarly, any word must have T at position 2.

So pattern: [letter] T [letter] E R

With available letters for position 1 and 3.

Position 1: can be D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W, etc.

Position 3: same, but must form a word.

Possible words:
- ""UTTER"" - U at 1, T at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So U and T (duplicate).
- ""DETER"" - D E T E R -> but position 2 is E? We need T at 2. So invalid.
- ""PETER"" - P E T E R -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.
- ""SOWER"" - S O W E R -> O absent? O(x) from this guess. Invalid.
- ""SUPER"" - S U P E R -> position 2 is U, not T. Invalid.
- ""TAMER"" - T A M E R -> A and M absent, and position 1 is T? But we have T at 2, so position 1 cannot be T? We don't know, but T is at 2, so position 1 could be T? But we have T at 2 fixed, so if position 1 is T, that's duplicate. But ""TAMER"" has T at 1 and 2? Not, ""TAMER"" is T A M E R, so position 1: T, 2: A, but we need position 2 to be T, so not.

We need position 2 to be T, so the word must have T at 2.

So ""UTTER"" is a valid word: U T T E R.

Another possibility: ""BUTTER"" is 6 letters.

""UTTER"" is 5 letters.

""ETTER"" not a word? Or ""UTTER"" is the main one.

""UTERI"" not, that's 5 but ends with I, not R.

So ""UTTER"" seems the most common.

But we have position 3 to fill, and in ""UTTER"" it's T.

Another word: ""APTER"" not.

""OXTER"" but O absent.

""FUTER"" not common.

""JUTER"" not common.

""VUTER"" not a word.

So ""UTTER"" is a common word that fits.

We can also consider ""DATER"" but A absent.

So I think ""UTTER"" is the word to guess.

But let's see if there are other options.

""STERN"" but N absent and position 2 is T? ""STERN"" is S T E R N -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:R, 5:N -> but we need E at 4 and R at 5? Here E at 3 and R at 4, N at 5? Not matching.

""STEER"" S T E E R -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R -> but we have E at 4? Here position 4 is E, and R at 5, so that matches? But position 3 is E, which might be duplicate? And we need to check if E can be at 3? We have no feedback against E at 3.

But ""STEER"" has E at 3 and 4? So duplicate E.

And S is available.

But we have the pattern: _ T _ E R, so for ""STEER"": position 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R -> so position 3 is E, which is a vowel.

But we don't know if E is duplicated.

Similarly, ""SHEER"" but H absent? H(x) from this guess.

""SWEER"" not common.

""STEER"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""SKEER"" not common.

""QUEER"" Q U E E R -> position 2 is U, not T. Invalid.

So ""STEER"" is another possibility.

But in ""STEER"", position 3 is E, which is a vowel, and we have E at 4.

Now, we have two candidates: ""UTTER"" and ""STEER"".

But ""UTTER"" has U at 1 and T at 3, while ""STEER"" has S at 1 and E at 3.

We need to choose one to guess.

Since we have limited guesses, we can pick one that tests new letters.

In ""UTTER"", we test U and the possibility of duplicate T.

In ""STEER"", we test S and the possibility of duplicate E.

But we know E is at 4, and we don't know if it can be duplicated? Similarly for T.

But from feedback, we have no duplicate letters so far, so it might be single.

But we have to consider.

Another word: ""DIVER"" D I V E R -> but I absent? I(x) from TIMER.

""GIVER"" G I V E R -> I absent.

""LIVER"" L absent.

""RIVER"" R I V E R -> I absent and duplicate R? R at 1 and 5? But we have R at 5 fixed, so duplicate possible? But I absent.

""WIVER"" not common.

""SEVER"" S E V E R -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.

""PURE"" not 5 letters.

""PUTER"" not common, but P U T E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but we need position 2 to be T? Here position 2 is U, not T. So invalid.

We need position 2 to be T.

So back to ""UTTER"" and ""STEER"".

""STEER"" has position 2 as T? Yes, S T E E R, so position 2 is T.

Position 1: S, position 3: E.

But E is at position 3, which is not 4, so it might be a different E? Or duplicate.

Similarly, ""UTTER"" has U at 1 and T at 3.

Now, U and S are both available.

We can choose ""UTTER"" to test the duplicate T possibility.

Or ""STEER"" for duplicate E.

But let's see the feedback from guess 4: we have T at 2 correct, so the word has T at 2.

If we guess ""UTTER"", and if the word is ""UTTER"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on U and the duplicate T.

Similarly for ""STEER"".

But there might be other words.

Another word: ""DETER"" but position 2 is E, not T.

""TERRY"" not, ends with Y.

""TERSE"" T E R S E -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.

""TUNER"" T U N E R -> but N absent? N(x) from guess 1. And position 1 is T? But we have T at 2, so if position 1 is T, duplicate? ""TUNER"" has T at 1 and 2? Not, ""TUNER"" is T U N E R, so position 1:T, 2:U, but we need position 2 to be T, so not.

We need position 2 to be T, so the first letter can be any except T? Or duplicate? But in ""UTTER"", position 1 is U, not T.

So position 1 is not T, because if it were T, then in ""TIMER"" when we had T at 1, it was marked as present but wrong position, but now we know T is at 2, so position 1 cannot be T? Because if position 1 were T, then in ""TIMER"" (guess 3) T at 1 should have been correct? But it was marked as T(-), meaning present but wrong position, so T is not at position 1. Therefore, position 1 cannot be T. So no duplicate T at position 1.

Similarly, in the word, T is only at position 2? Or could be elsewhere? We don't know.

But in ""UTTER"", if we have T at 2 and T at 3, that's possible.

Similarly, in ""STEER"", T at 2 and E at 3 and 4.

But for position 1, it cannot be T.

So for ""UTTER"", position 1 is U, which is not T.

Now, let's list all possible words that fit _ T _ E R with available letters.

Available letters for position 1: D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W (and others like K, but less common)

For position 3: same, but must form a word.

Possible words:
- ""UTTER"" - U at 1, T at 3 (duplicate T)
- ""STEER"" - S at 1, E at 3 (duplicate E)
- ""DETER"" - D at 1, E at 3? But ""DETER"" is D E T E R -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.
- ""PETER"" - P E T E R -> position 2 E, not T.
- ""SKEET"" not ending with R.
- ""SWEER"" not common.
- ""FREER"" F R E E R -> position 2 is R, not T. Invalid.
- ""GREET"" not ending with R.
- ""KNEEL"" not.
- ""QUEER"" position 2 U, not T.
- ""SUPER"" position 2 U, not T.
- ""TWIER"" not common.
- ""VIEWR"" not a word.

So only ""UTTER"" and ""STEER"" seem common.

""UTTER"" uses U and tests duplicate T.

""STEER"" uses S and tests duplicate E.

We can choose ""UTTER"" because U is a vowel and might be more likely? Or S is common.

But let's see the feedback from guess 2: BERYL had E at 2 and it was wrong position, but that doesn't prevent E at 3.

Similarly, no feedback on U.

I think both are possible.

But we have to guess one.

Perhaps ""UTTER"" is better because it tests a new vowel U.

Or ""STEER"" tests S, a common consonant.

But in ""STEER"", if we guess it, and if E is not duplicated, we might get E at 3 marked as absent or wrong position? But E is in the word at 4, so if there is no duplicate, E at 3 would be marked as absent? Or if present but wrong position? But E is at 4, so if position 3 is not E, then E at 3 would be marked as absent if no duplicate.

But we don't know.

Similarly for T in ""UTTER"".

To be safe, let's guess ""UTTER"".

So I'll go with that.

<guess>UTTER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
     - Absent letters: C, A, N  
     - R and E are present but misplaced (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).
   - **Guess 2 (BERYL)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)  
     - Absent letters: B, Y, L  
     - E and R are present but misplaced (E not in position 2, R not in position 3).
   - **Guess 3 (TIMER)**: T(-), I(x), M(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
     - Absent letters: I, M  
     - E and R are correct at positions 4 and 5 (so the word ends with ""ER"").  
     - T is present but not in position 1.
   - **Guess 4 (OTHER)**: O(x), T(✓), H(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
     - Absent letters: O, H  
     - T is correct at position 2, E at 4, R at 5 (so the word pattern is `_ T _ E R`).  
     - O and H are absent.

2. **Key Insights:**
   - **Fixed positions**: Position 2 is T, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. The word structure is `_ T _ E R`.
   - **Absent letters**: A, B, C, H, I, L, M, N, O, Y (all ruled out from feedback).
   - **Present letters to include**: T, E, R are confirmed (with E and R fixed at positions 4–5, and T fixed at position 2). No new letters are confirmed beyond these, but we must fill positions 1 and 3.
   - **Constraints**:
     - Position 1 cannot be T (from Guess 3 feedback: T not in position 1).
     - Position 3 cannot reuse E or R (since duplicates are possible but not confirmed; we need to test new letters).
     - Available letters for positions 1 and 3: D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W, and less common letters like J, K, Q, X, Z (but prioritize common English letters).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**
   - **Goal**: Solve the word by testing likely letters for positions 1 and 3, while maximizing information if the guess is incorrect.
   - **Pattern**: `_ T _ E R` (e.g., words like ""UTTER"" or ""STEER"").
   - **Prioritize common words**: Focus on high-frequency letters (e.g., S, U, P, D) to cover likely candidates.
   - **Key candidate**: ""UTTER"" fits the pattern perfectly:
     - Position 1: U (common vowel, not tested yet).
     - Position 3: T (tests for duplicate T, which is possible based on Wordle rules).
     - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on U and the duplicate T will reveal the solution.
   - **Why not other words?** 
     - ""STEER"" (S at position 1, E at position 3) is possible but tests E duplication, which is less likely given E is fixed at position 4 and hasn't shown duplication hints. It also wastes a chance to test U.
     - ""DETER"" or ""PETER"" are invalid (position 2 must be T, not E).
     - U is a strong choice for position 1 (common in words like ""UTTER""), and testing T at position 3 efficiently checks for duplicates.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If ""UTTER"" is correct, feedback will show all ✓.
   - If incorrect:
     - U(x) would mean position 1 is not U (pointing to S, P, or D).
     - T(-) at position 3 would mean T is not duplicated (so position 3 must be a different letter, like S or P).
     - Feedback will directly identify the solution with 1–2 more guesses.

Since I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to choose a word that maximizes the amount of useful information I can get. This means selecting a word with common letters that might appear in many 5-letter English words.\n\nI recall that many Wordle players start with words that contain a mix of vowels and common consonants. Vowels are crucial because almost every English word has at least one vowel. Among consonants, letters like R, S, T, L, and N appear frequently.\n\nConsidering this, a good starting word might be something like ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"". Another option is ""ROAST"". After thinking about it, ""CRANE"" seems solid because:\n\n- It includes two vowels: A and E.\n- Common consonants: C, R, N.\n\nThe vowel distribution seems good—E is the most common English letter, and A is also very frequent. Consonants like C, R, N are also quite common.\n\nAlternatively, ""SLATE"" could be another excellent choice due to the combination of S, L, A, T, E—all very common letters.

Possible slots for R: 1,3,4,5 (since position 2 was wrong). Possible slots for E: 1,2,3,4 (position 5 was wrong).  \n\nNeed a word with:  \n- R in positions 1,3,4, or 5.  \n- E in positions 1,2,3, or 4.  \n- Avoid C,A,N entirely.  \n\nGood candidate letters to test: Other common consonants like S,T,L,P,D,M since vowels A is out, so focus on remaining vowels (O,I,U) or consonants.  \n\nPossible words:  \n- Could try **RESET**? No—E repeated, and we risk duplicate letter issues. Better avoid duplicates for now.  \n- **TRIBE**: Has R (position 1), E (position 5). But position 5 was originally E(-), meaning E isn\'t at end—so placing E at position 5 again would likely still be wrong. R at position 1 is new—could be correct?  \n- **PERCH**: Has P,E,R,C... Wait, C is out—invalid.  \n- **SERUM**: Has S,E,R,U,M—all new letters except E/R. Positions: R at 3, E at 2.  \n  - Feedback told us E isn\'t at position 5, but position 2 might work; same for R not at 2—so position 3 for R is fresh.  \n\nOther options: **ROUSE**? Has R,O,U,S,E. Positions: R(1), E(5)—but original feedback had E(-) at position 5, so E shouldn\'t be at end. Risk rechecking E at 5.  \n\nBetter to avoid reusing the position E was wrong in. Since E couldn\'t be at spot 5, placing it elsewhere—like **SERUM** (E at spot 2) or **BREAD** (R at 3, E at 4—E at 4 avoids position 5).  \n\n**BREAD** might be strong:  \n- B,R,E,A,D. But A is out! A was x in first guess → banned. So invalid.  \n\nRevised: **PRIDE**? Has P,R,I,D,E.  \n- Positions: R(2)—but R was tried at position 2 originally and was marked wrong (-), so placing R at position 2 again likely still wrong. Avoid reused positions for known letters.  \n\nBest candidates:  \n- **SPIRE**: R at 4, E at 5—but E at 5 was wrong before, so probably still wrong.  \n- **RODEO**: Has R,O,D,E,O—E at position 4. Avoids reused spots: R at position 1 (new), E at position 4 (new). Also tests O and D.  \n\nBut **RODEO** has duplicate O—might reduce information. Prefer all distinct letters.  \n\n**SOLVE**? Has S,O,L,V,E—E at position 5 → same issue. Avoid position 5 for E.  \n\n**STRIDE**: S,T,R,I,D,E.  \n- Positions: R(3), E(6)—wait, only 5 letters. **STRIP**? No E needed. Must include E.  \n\n**SHIRE**? E at 5 again—no.  \n\nBetter: **MERCY**? But C is out—forbidden.  \n\n**BERYL**? B,E,R,Y,L. Positions: R at 3, E at 2—both new slots. Letters: Tests B,Y,L.  \n\nKey points:  \n- Secret word has R and E, positions unknown but not index 2 for R and not index 5 for E.  \n- Must exclude C,A,N.  \n\n**BERYL** seems valid:  \n- E at position 2 → originally untested for E (since E was at 5 before).  \n- R at position 3 → originally R was at 2, so position 3 is new.  \n- Tests B,Y,L—new letters.  \n\nAlternative: **PERKY**—but K new, but E at position 4 avoids previous error slots.  \n\nHowever, **BERYL** is a gemstone—valid English word. Solid choice to test R and E in new contexts while introducing fresh consonants.  \n\nDecision: Next guess → **BERYL**.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  \n- **C(x)**: C is not in the word.  \n- **R(-)**: R is in the word, but not in position 2.  \n- **A(x)**: A is not in the word.  \n- **N(x)**: N is not in the word.  \n- **E(-)**: E is in the word, but not in position 5.  \n\nKey insights:  \n1. **R** and **E** are confirmed present but misplaced.  \n2. **C, A, N** are absent and cannot be reused.  \n3. R cannot be in position 2 (tried incorrectly), and E cannot be in position 5 (tried incorrectly).  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n4. Must include **R** and **E** in *new positions*. Ideal positions for R: 1, 3, or 4 (since position 2 is ruled out). For E: 1–4 (position 5 ruled out).  \n5. Should introduce common unused letters like **S, T, L, B, P, D, M**, or vowels **O, I, U**, while avoiding C, A, N.  \n6. Prioritize words with distinct letters to maximize information.  \n\nA strong candidate is **BERYL**:  \n- Tests **R** in position 3 (new position)  \n- Tests **E** in position 2 (new position)  \n- Introduces new letters: **B, Y, L** (common consonants and vowel-like Y)  \n- Avoids banned letters (C, A, N) and reused positions for R/E.  \n\nThis guess optimally narrows possibilities for the secret word.\n\n<guess>BERYL</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback:\n\nFirst guess ""CRANE"": C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nSecond guess ""BERYL"": B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)\n\nFrom the first guess, we know:\n- R and E are in the word, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.\n- C, A, N are not in the word.\n\nFrom the second guess:\n- B(x): B is not in the word.\n- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 2 (since in BERYL, E was in position 2).\n- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since in BERYL, R was in position 3).\n- Y(x): Y is not in the word.\n- L(x): L is not in the word.\n\nNow, combining the information:\n- Letters confirmed in the word: R, E.\n- Letters ruled out: C, A, N, B, Y, L.\n- Position constraints:\n  - R is not in position 2 (from CRANE) and not in position 3 (from BERYL). So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n  - E is not in position 5 (from CRANE) and not in position 2 (from BERYL). So E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nBecause the word has 5 letters and we know only R and E must be included, we need to find a word that contains R and E, and three more letters that have not been ruled out.\n\nRuled out letters: A, B, C, L, N, Y. So available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.\n\nWe also know the secret word must be composed of only these available letters plus R and E.\n\nPossible positions for R: 1, 4, 5\nPossible positions for E: 1, 3, 4\n\nNote that R and E might occupy the same position? But no, because each position can only have one letter. Also, they are two distinct letters unless the word has duplicates? But we don\'t know yet. But from the feedback, since we got two (probably) distinct letters, we assume they are different.\n\nNow, we have to form a word that respects:\n- Includes R and E at positions that are consistent with the exclusions.\n- Does not include any ruled out letters.\n\nMoreover, we must avoid the positions where they were misplaced.\n\nLet me think of words that have R and E, and try to assign positions.\n\nPossible positions:\n\nCase 1: R at position 1.\nThen E can be at 3 or 4 (not at 1 because same position, and not at 2 or 5).\n\nSo if R is at 1, then E at 3 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, if R at 4, then E at 1 or 3 (since E cannot be at 4 same as R? Wait, position 4 would have E and R? No, same position cannot have two letters. So when R is at 4, E cannot be at 4).\n\nSimilarly, R at 5: E at 1 or 3.\n\nWe also need to fill the other positions with letters that aren\'t excluded.\n\nSince we have limited tries, we want a word that tests new common letters and further constraints.\n\nLet\'s list possible words.\n\nCommon words with R and E:\n\nThink of words where R is in position 1: e.g., ""RE..."". Then E must be at 3 or 4.\n\nExamples:\n- ""RESET"" has duplicate E, and S and T allowed? But E is at position 2 and 5? Not allowed: E cannot be at 5 and also we have E at 2 in second guess? But feedback: E(-) at position 2 meaning wrong position, so E might be at other positions but we know E cannot be at 2 in this word? Wait.\n\nActually, ""RESET"" has E at 2 and 5. Position 2 we know E is not correct there from second guess? Yes, but E can be at 5? Wait, no: first guess had E at 5 and it was wrong position, so E cannot be at 5. Similarly, in second guess E at 2 wrong. So ""RESET"" would place E at 2 and 5, both forbidden positions? So invalid.\n\nAnother one: ""RIPER"" → has R at 1 and E at 4? And positions: \nPosition 1: R (known to be acceptable location? but not confirmed if correct)\nPosition 2: I\nPosition 3: P\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: R? But now E is in position 4: which is allowed? Yes, because E was not ruled out for position 4. And R at position 4? Wait, ""RIPER"" has two R\'s? And R at position 5: but position 5 is allowed? R can be at 5? Since we only have position constraints for R: cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.\n\nBut let\'s check: the word must have at least one R and one E. But ""RIPER"" has R at three positions? Not efficient but possible.\n\nMoreover, in the first guess, we had E at 5 which was wrong, so the secret word might have E at 4. Similarly R at 4 or elsewhere.\n\nBut multiple R\'s? Possible? The rules don\'t forbid duplicate letters.\n\nHowever, in feedback, if a letter is duplicated, it can complicate. For simplicity, maybe avoid duplicates for now.\n\nBut considering: if there is duplicate, the feedback might mark multiples. But for now, let\'s assume we prefer distinct letters if possible.\n\nAnother idea: use a word with R and E and test new common consonants.\n\nFor example, S, T, P, etc.\n\nPossible word: ""ROGUE"". But O and U: not excluded. R at 1, E at 5? E is at 5? But first guess: E cannot be at 5. So not.\n\nWord: ""RIFLE""? But F and L? But L is ruled out: from second guess, L(x), so L not in word. So no.\n\n""RIDER"" - R at 1, D, then E at 4? R and D: but R at 5? Duplicate R.\n\nPerhaps ""RISEN""? But S and N? N ruled out? First guess: N(x), so not allowed.\n\nSince A, N, C, B, L, Y are out, available letters: D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.\n\nTry R at 1 and E at 3: e.g., ""R_ E _ _"". Like:\n\n- ""RIPER"" but duplicate R? Or non-distinct.\n- ""RIVER"": R at 1, I, V, E at 4? Wait, E at 4? But position: ""RIVER"" has positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:V, 4:E, 5:R? E is at position 4? Which is allowed? E can be at position 4. But R at 1 and 5: which R at 5 is possible? R can be at 1,4,5? So 5 is allowed? Maybe.\n\nBut R at 5: we have constraint R not at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.\n\nSimilarly E at 4: not forbidden.\n\nBut I is new? V? But we need to test.\n\nAnother word: ""RISER"" - R at 1,5, S, E at 4? But S allowed. But similar to above.\n\nBut we might get less information due to duplicate.\n\nAlternative: positions R at 4 and E at 1 or 3.\n\nFor example, R at position 4: then word ends with _ _ _ R ? \n\nBut E must be at 1 or 3.\n\nIf E at 3: "" _ _ E R _""\n\nLike ""PILER""? But L ruled out? L not allowed.\n\n""TIMER"" - T, I, M, E, R? Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:M, 4:E, 5:R? \nBut E is at position 4? Which is allowed? And R at position 5? Also allowed? T,I,M are not ruled out.\n\nAnd E at position 4: from feedback, E cannot be at 2 or 5, so 4 or others? E can be at 4.\n\nSimilarly, R at 5? R cannot be at 2 or 3, so 5 is okay.\n\nAlso, T,I,M new letters.\n\nSimilarly, is ""TIMER"" valid? Yes, meaning a device that times.\n\nBut let\'s confirm constraints:\n- R: position 5, not 2 or 3 -> allowed.\n- E: position 4? But in the secret word, E must be placed at a new position? We haven\'t tested position 4 for E, so it\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, R at position 5: we tried R at position 2 and 3? In CRANE, R at 2; in BERYL, R at 3. So position 5 is new and allowed.\n\nSimilarly E at 4: never tested, so possible.\n\nBut we have another possibility: R at position 1 and E at position 4? Then we skip position 3? \n\nFor example: ""R _ _ E _"" \n\nWith the middle three positions letters from allowed set.\n\nWord: ""ROUGE""? E at 5? Not allowed.\n\n""ROUSE"" E at 5? Not.\n\n""RANGE"" G and E at 5? E at 5? Not allowed.\n\n""RIPEN"" N ruled out? Not.\n\nSo perhaps ""RIPER"" but duplicate? Or ""RIVER"" which we considered.\n\nBut ""RIVER"" has E at position 4? And R at 5? And V and I? Available.\n\nBut let\'s compare: ""TIMER"" tests T,I,M,E,R with E at 4 and R at 5.\n\nIt avoids duplicate letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""TIMER"" uses common letters.\n\nAnother option: ""PORES"" P,O,R,E,S? R at position 3? But R cannot be at 3? Because second guess had R at 3 and it was wrong! So if R at position 3, it would be incorrect. Thus ""PORES"" has R at 3, which is forbidden? No: the constraint is that R cannot be at 3? Because in BERYL, R was at 3 and feedback was R(-), meaning R is not in position 3. So we cannot put R at position 3. Similarly, position 2 was wrong.\n\nTherefore in ""TIMER"", R is at 5, which is new and allowed.\n\nSimilarly E at 4, also allowed.\n\nAlso, the word doesn\'t have any ruled out letters: T, I, M are possible.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""TIMER"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a better one: another word might be ""HOMER""? But O and H? E at 4? R at 5? Also possible? But we get less common letters? Slightly less frequent.\n\n""OFFER""? But duplicate F? And F? But E at 4? R at 5? O,F,F? Duplicate.\n\n""TIMER"" seems solid.\n\nSo next guess: ""TIMER""\n\nBut to confirm:\n- T: new\n- I: new\n- M: new\n- E: now placed at position 4, which is new.\n- R: at position 5, new.\n\nHoping to get ✓ on E or R, or identify correct letters.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, B, Y, L (from ""CRANE"" and ""BERYL"" feedback).\n- **Confirmed present letters**: R and E.\n- **Position constraints**:\n  - R cannot be in position 2 (from ""CRANE"" R(-)) or position 3 (from ""BERYL"" R(-)), so R must be in position 1, 4, or 5.\n  - E cannot be in position 2 (from ""BERYL"" E(-)) or position 5 (from ""CRANE"" E(-)), so E must be in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and E in new positions that respect the constraints (avoiding positions 2 and 3 for R, and positions 2 and 5 for E).\n- Use only available letters (not excluded), such as D, F, G, H, I, K, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, etc.\n- Prioritize common letters to maximize new information and avoid duplicates for clarity.\n\nAfter evaluating options, ""TIMER"" fits well:\n- R is in position 5 (allowed).\n- E is in position 4 (allowed).\n- Tests new common consonants T, M, and vowel I.\n- Avoids excluded letters and duplicate letters.\n\n<guess>TIMER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)\nGuess 3: TIMER -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n  - C, A, N are absent.\n  - R is present but not in position 2.\n  - E is present but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: BERYL -> B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)\n  - B, Y, L are absent.\n  - E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked wrong).\n  - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong).\n\nGuess 3: TIMER -> T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n  - T is present but not in position 1.\n  - I and M are absent.\n  - E is correct at position 4 (so the 4th letter is E).\n  - R is correct at position 5 (so the 5th letter is R).\n\nSo, we know:\n- The word has E in the 4th position and R in the 5th position. So the word ends with ""ER"".\n- Additionally, we have T present in the word, but not in position 1 (since in TIMER it was in position 1 and marked as wrong position).\n- We have R and E confirmed from the start, and now we know their exact positions: 4 and 5.\n\nAlso, from the first two guesses, we know that R is not in position 2 or 3, and E is not in position 2 or 5 (but now we know E is in 4, so that\'s consistent). Also, R is now fixed at 5.\n\nNow, the word structure: _ _ _ E R\n\nWe know T is in the word but not in position 1. So T must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nAlso, we have a list of absent letters: C, A, N, B, Y, L, I, M.\n\nSo absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y.\n\nTherefore, available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and possibly others, but we know T is present.\n\nSince T is present and must be in position 2 or 3, we can consider words of the form:\n- If T is in position 2: _ T _ E R\n- If T is in position 3: _ _ T E R\n\nWe also need to fill the first and the third (or second) position with available letters, and the word must be a valid English word.\n\nMoreover, we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on the 4th guess), so we want to maximize information.\n\nBut we also have two positions to figure out: positions 1 and either 2 or 3 (depending on where T is). Actually, we don\'t know which of the two positions T is in.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 and tests a common letter for position 1 and 3, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to cover multiple possibilities.\n\nBut note: we have only two unknown positions? Actually, no: the word is 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5. We know 4 and 5 (E and R). So we need positions 1,2,3.\n\nBut we know T is in the word and must be in either 2 or 3. So one of position 2 or 3 is T, and the other is another letter, and position 1 is another letter.\n\nSo we have three positions to determine, but with the constraint that T is in one of 2 or 3.\n\nWe can think of two cases:\n\nCase 1: T in position 2 -> word: _ T _ E R\nCase 2: T in position 3 -> word: _ _ T E R\n\nWe need to find words that fit one of these patterns and use only available letters.\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and we know T is used.\n\nCommon letters left: S, T, O, P, D, etc.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 and tests a vowel for position 1 and a consonant for 3, or vice versa.\n\nBut we also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s list possible words for each case.\n\nFirst, for Case 1: _ T _ E R\nPossible words:\n- After T, the third letter must be a vowel or consonant that can form a word. Common words: \n  - ""OTTER"" -> but T is repeated? And O in position 1. But we have T in position 2 and 3? But we need position 3 to be a letter, then E R. ""OTTER"" has two T\'s? Then it would be O T T E R. But position 3 is T? Then we have T in position 2 and 3? But we know T is only one? Not necessarily, but we don\'t know. However, in feedback, for TIMER, T was present but wrong position, so it could be that there is only one T? But it might be duplicated? We don\'t know.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nSo without duplicates: \n- ""UTTER"" -> again duplicate T? U T T E R -> same.\n- ""STYER"" -> but Y is absent? Y is ruled out (from BERYL: Y(x)).\n- ""STOER""? Not a word? \n- ""STOER"" might not be common. \n- ""ATER""? But A is absent.\n\nBetter: ""OTTER"" is a word, but duplicate T.\n\n""AFTER""? But A is absent.\n\n""OUTER""? O U T E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but this is for Case 2? No, for Case 1 we need T in position 2.\n\nFor Case 1: _ T _ E R\n- Position 1: any available letter except absent ones.\n- Position 3: any available letter.\n\nExamples:\n- ""STYER"" invalid because Y absent.\n- ""PTER"" is not 5 letters? We need 5 letters.\n\n""OTTER"": O T T E R -> but position 3 is T, so it has two T\'s. But we don\'t know if T is duplicated? It could be.\n\nBut let\'s see: in TIMER, we had T in position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one T in the word, but it could be more. However, the feedback doesn\'t tell us if there are duplicates. So we have to consider.\n\nBut for now, let\'s avoid if possible.\n\nAnother word: ""UTTER"" same issue.\n\n""AFTER"" A absent.\n\n""ENTER"" E in position 1? But we have E already at 4, and E might be duplicated? But in first guess, E was present but not at 5, and now we have E at 4. But we don\'t know if there is another E? The feedback doesn\'t show duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter is duplicated, the feedback might be tricky. For example, if the word has one E and you guess two, one might be marked as absent.\n\nBut in our case, we haven\'t guessed duplicates yet.\n\nPerhaps we can try a word without duplicates for Case 1.\n\nWhat about ""OTHER""? O T H E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:T, 3:H, 4:E, 5:R -> this fits Case 1: T in position 2.\n\nAnd H is available? H not ruled out.\n\nSimilarly, ""OTTER"" has duplicate T, but ""OTHER"" does not.\n\n""OTHER"" is a valid word.\n\nNow, for Case 2: _ _ T E R\nExamples:\n- ""CATER"" but C and A absent.\n- ""DATER"" A absent.\n- ""HATER"" A absent.\n- ""LATER"" A and L absent? L is absent.\n- ""MATER"" M absent? M is absent from TIMER: M(x).\n- ""PATER"" P A T E R -> A absent.\n- ""RATER"" R at position 1? But we have R at 5, and R might be duplicated? But we don\'t know. Also, in ""RATER"", R is at 1 and 5? But position 1: R, then A absent? A is absent.\n\nAnother: ""WATER"" A absent.\n\n""SOBER"" but B absent? B is absent from BERYL: B(x).\n\n""COVER"" C absent.\n\n""POKER"" P O K E R -> K is available? K not ruled out.\n\n""POKER"" is a word: positions 1:P, 2:O, 3:K, 4:E, 5:R.\n\nSimilarly, ""POWER"" O W E R -> but then position 3: W? ""POWER"" is P O W E R.\n\n""TOWER"" T O W E R -> but T is in position 1? But we are in Case 2, which is T in position 3? ""TOWER"" has T in position 1, not 3.\n\nFor Case 2, we need T in position 3: so _ _ T E R.\n\nSo ""POKER"" has K? And P and O.\n\n""POSER"" P O S E R -> S is available.\n\n""POSER"" is a word: P O S E R.\n\nSimilarly, ""DOPER"" D O P E R -> but P and D? ""DOPER"" might not be common? But valid.\n\n""DOSER"" D O S E R.\n\nBut we also have T to place? In Case 2, T is in position 3, so the word must have T at 3.\n\nSo for Case 2: _ _ T E R\n\nExamples:\n- ""BITER"" B absent.\n- ""CITER"" C absent.\n- ""DITER"" not a word.\n- ""FIGHTER"" too long.\n- ""HITTER"" H I T T E R -> duplicate T? And I absent? I is absent from TIMER: I(x).\n- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but that\'s 5 letters? L I T R E, positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need E at 4 and R at 5? Here R is at 4 and E at 5? Not matching.\n\nWe need the pattern to have E at 4 and R at 5, so the last two are fixed as ER.\n\nSo for Case 2: positions: 1,2,3=T,4=E,5=R? No: position 3 is T, then 4=E, 5=R.\n\nSo the word is: ? ? T E R\n\nExamples:\n- ""MITER"" M absent? M(x) from TIMER.\n- ""NITER"" N absent.\n- ""PETER"" P E T E R -> positions: 1:P, 2:E, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but E at 2 and 4? But we have E at 4, and E might be duplicated? But in this case, position 2 is E? But we know E cannot be at position 2 from BERYL feedback? BERYL had E at 2 and it was wrong position, so E is not at 2. So ""PETER"" would have E at 2, which is forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, ""RUTER"" R U T E R -> R at 1 and 5? But R at 1: we don\'t know if R is duplicated? But we have R at 5 fixed. Also, U is available.\n\nBut ""RUTER"" is not a common word? Router is 6 letters.\n\n""SUPER"" S U P E R -> but no T? We need T at position 3.\n\n""SUPER"" is S U P E R, so position 3 is P, not T.\n\nWe need T at 3.\n\n""UTTER"" U T T E R -> but T at 2 and 3? So for Case 2, we need T at 3, but ""UTTER"" has T at 2 and 3? So position 3 is T, but also position 2 is T? So it fits the pattern? The pattern is _ _ T E R, so position 3 is T, but position 2 can be anything? In ""UTTER"", position 1:U, 2:T, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R. So position 3 is T, which is what we want for Case 2? But position 2 is also T? So it has duplicate T.\n\nBut the pattern for Case 2 is: position 3 must be T, but position 2 can be T or not? It can be, but we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, ""OTTER"" for Case 2: O T T E R -> position 3 is T? Yes, but position 2 is T? So again duplicate.\n\nBut we can consider.\n\nAnother word: ""AFTER"" A absent.\n\n""ENTER"" E at 1? But E cannot be at 1? We don\'t know, but E is at 4, and we don\'t know about duplicates. But in ""ENTER"", E at 1 and 4? Position 1: E, which might be possible? But we have no feedback about E at position 1. However, in the first guess, E was at 5 and wrong, and second guess E at 2 and wrong, but position 1 has not been tested for E. So it could be.\n\nBut ""ENTER"" has E at 1 and 4? And T at 3? So for Case 2: _ _ T E R, ""ENTER"" would be E N T E R -> but N is absent? N(x) from CRANE.\n\nSo not.\n\n""INTER"" I absent.\n\n""OUTER"" O U T E R -> positions: 1:O, 2:U, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> this fits Case 2: T at position 3.\n\nAnd O and U are available.\n\n""OUTER"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""POKER"" is P O K E R, but no T? Position 3 is K, not T.\n\nFor Case 2, we need T at 3.\n\nSo ""OUTER"" is a good candidate.\n\nNow, back to our guess: we need to choose a word that can help distinguish between the cases.\n\nBut we also know that T must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nWe can guess a word that has T in position 2, for example, to test Case 1.\n\nOr one with T in position 3 for Case 2.\n\nBut we can also guess a word that has T in one of them and tests the other positions.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should choose a word that covers common possibilities.\n\nBut we have two main candidates: ""OTHER"" for Case 1 (T in 2) and ""OUTER"" for Case 2 (T in 3).\n\nIf we guess ""OTHER"", it tests:\n- Position 1: O\n- Position 2: T (which we suspect might be correct if Case 1)\n- Position 3: H\n\nAnd we know position 4 and 5 are E and R.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""OUTER"", it tests:\n- Position 1: O\n- Position 2: U\n- Position 3: T (for Case 2)\n\nBut we don\'t know which case.\n\nWe could guess a word that has T in position 2 and uses a common letter for position 1 and 3, or vice versa.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that has T in position 3 and tests position 1 and 2 with common letters.\n\nBut we also have T present, so we must include T.\n\nLet\'s list all possible words that fit the pattern and use available letters.\n\nFirst, for Case 1: _ T _ E R\nPossible words with available letters (no absent letters):\n- ""OTHER"" (O, T, H, E, R)\n- ""UTTER"" (U, T, T, E, R) - duplicate T\n- ""OTTER"" (O, T, T, E, R) - duplicate T\n- ""STVER"" not a word.\n- ""STYER"" invalid Y.\n- ""PTER"" not 5 letters.\n- ""DATER"" A absent.\n- So ""OTHER"" is the main one without duplicates.\n\nFor Case 2: _ _ T E R\n- ""OUTER"" (O, U, T, E, R)\n- ""PETER"" (P, E, T, E, R) - but E at 2, which is forbidden (from BERYL, E not at 2)\n- ""MITER"" M absent.\n- ""NITER"" N absent.\n- ""RUTER"" not common, but R U T E R? Might be accepted? But R at 1 and 5? Duplicate R? And U.\n- ""SUTER"" not common.\n- ""CITER"" C absent.\n- ""HITTER"" H I T T E R -> I absent and duplicate T.\n- ""JITTER"" too long.\n- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but R at 4 and E at 5? Not matching our pattern (we need E at 4, R at 5). ""LITRE"" is L-I-T-R-E, so positions: 1:L, 2:I, 3:T, 4:R, 5:E -> but we need 4:E and 5:R, so not.\n- ""METER"" M absent and E at 2? Forbidden.\n- ""POKER"" no T at 3.\n- ""POSER"" no T.\n- So ""OUTER"" is a good candidate for Case 2.\n\nAlso, ""AFTER"" is invalid due to A.\n\nSo we have two main possibilities: ""OTHER"" and ""OUTER"".\n\nBut ""OTHER"" has T in position 2, and ""OUTER"" has T in position 3.\n\nWe can choose one to test.\n\nSince we have T present and we know it\'s not in 1, it must be in 2 or 3.\n\nIf we guess ""OTHER"":\n- If T is in position 2, then we might get T(✓) at position 2, and then we know the word is _ T _ E R, and we have O and H to check.\n- If T is not in position 2, then we know T must be in position 3 (since it\'s present), and then we get T(-) for position 2, meaning T is in the word but not at 2, so it must be at 3.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""OUTER"":\n- If T is in position 3, we get T(✓) at 3.\n- If not, then T must be in position 2.\n\nBut in ""OUTER"", position 3 is T, so if T is in position 3, it will be correct.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nAlso, by guessing ""OTHER"", we test O and H.\n\nSimilarly, ""OUTER"" tests O and U.\n\nCommon letters: O is common, H and U are also common.\n\nBut we have no information about O, H, U.\n\nWe can choose one.\n\nAnother word: what about ""POWER""? But ""POWER"" is P O W E R, so positions: 1:P, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But no T? We must include T because it\'s present. So we cannot guess a word without T.\n\nSimilarly, we must include T in the guess.\n\nSo we have to have T in the word.\n\nTherefore, between ""OTHER"" and ""OUTER"", both are valid.\n\nLet\'s see which one gives more information.\n\nIf we guess ""OTHER"":\n- If we get T(✓) at position 2, then the word is _ T H E R, and we only need position 1. And from feedback, we\'ll know about O and H.\n- If we get T(-) at position 2, then T is not at 2, so it must be at 3, and then the word is _ _ T E R, and we know O and H are not in the word? Not necessarily, but we get feedback on O and H.\n\nSimilarly for ""OUTER"".\n\nBut we have only two cases, so after this guess, we might solve it.\n\nSince we have E and R fixed, and T must be in 2 or 3, we can also consider guessing a word that has T in position 3 and common letters for 1 and 2.\n\nFor example, ""OUTER"" does that.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""OTHER"" as a guess.\n\nOr perhaps ""SHOER"" but S H O E R? But no T? Must include T.\n\nAnother word: ""TOWER"" T O W E R -> positions: 1:T, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R. But we know T cannot be in position 1 (from TIMER feedback: T(-) at position 1, so T not at 1). So ""TOWER"" has T at 1, which is forbidden. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot have T in position 1.\n\nSo back to ""OTHER"" or ""OUTER"".\n\nI think ""OTHER"" is a good guess.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""OTHER"".\n\nThen, based on feedback, we can determine.\n\nBut let\'s see the response format.\n\nWe need to output the guess.\n\nSo <guess>OTHER</guess>\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we might get.\n\nIf the word is ""OTHER"", then we get all correct? But we don\'t know.\n\nIf not, we get information.\n\nBut we have to make a guess.\n\nAnother possibility: the word could be ""UTTER"" or ""OTTER"", but let\'s try to avoid duplicates first.\n\nSo I think ""OTHER"" is fine.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**\n   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)\n     - C, A, N are absent from the word.\n     - R is present but not in position 2.\n     - E is present but not in position 5.\n   - **Guess 2 (BERYL)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)\n     - B, Y, L are absent.\n     - E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and marked wrong).\n     - R is present but not in position 3 (since it was guessed in position 3 and marked wrong).\n   - **Guess 3 (TIMER)**: T(-), I(x), M(x), E(✓), R(✓)\n     - T is present but not in position 1.\n     - I and M are absent.\n     - E is correct at position 4 (so the 4th letter is E).\n     - R is correct at position 5 (so the 5th letter is R).\n\n2. **Key Insights:**\n   - The word ends with ""ER"" (positions 4 and 5 are fixed as E and R).\n   - T is present but cannot be in position 1 (from TIMER feedback). Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed, T must be in position 2 or 3.\n   - Absent letters: A, B, C, I, L, M, N, Y (from all feedback).\n   - Available letters: D, F, G, H, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, and others not ruled out.\n   - Word structure: `_ _ _ E R` (positions 1, 2, 3 unknown, with T in either 2 or 3).\n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**\n   - Must include T (since it\'s confirmed present) and test its position (2 or 3).\n   - Avoid absent letters and reuse E and R in their correct positions (4 and 5) to confirm consistency.\n   - Test new common letters (e.g., O, H, U) to gather more information.\n   - Prioritize words without duplicates for clearer feedback.\n   - Two main candidate patterns:\n     - **Case 1**: T in position 2 → `_ T _ E R` (e.g., ""OTHER"").\n     - **Case 2**: T in position 3 → `_ _ T E R` (e.g., ""OUTER"").\n   - ""OTHER"" is chosen because:\n     - It tests T in position 2 (helping resolve the position ambiguity).\n     - It introduces new common letters: O (position 1) and H (position 3), which are not ruled out.\n     - If T is in position 2, feedback may confirm it (✓) or indicate it\'s misplaced (-), narrowing T to position 3.\n     - Feedback on O and H will help identify the remaining letters.\n\n4. **Expected Outcomes:**\n   - If T is in position 2: Feedback may show T(✓) and provide info on O and H.\n   - If T is not in position 2: Feedback will show T(-), confirming T must be in position 3, and provide info on O and H for other positions.\n   - This guess maximizes information with common letters and avoids duplicates.\n\n<guess>OTHER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: BERYL -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) R(-) Y(x) L(x)\nGuess 3: TIMER -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: OTHER -> FEEDBACK: O(x) T(✓) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from Guess 4: OTHER -> O(x) T(✓) H(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nThis means:\n- O is absent (x)\n- T is correct and in the right position (position 2) (✓)\n- H is absent (x)\n- E is correct (position 4) (✓)\n- R is correct (position 5) (✓)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The word has T in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5.

Yes, and T is at 2, then T at 3? But we have to check if duplicate T is allowed? It might be, but let\'s see.\n  - ""UTTER"": positions: 1:U, 2:T, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but position 3 is T, which is the same as position 2? So duplicate T.\n- ""OTTER"" - but O is absent? O(x) from this guess, so O cannot be used. So invalid.\n- ""AFTER"" - A absent.\n- ""ENTER"" - E at position 1? But E is at 4, and we don\'t know about duplicates. But N absent? N(x) from guess 1. Also, E at 1: we have no feedback that E cannot be at 1, but in guess 2, E was at 2 and wrong, and in guess 1 at 5 and wrong. So E at 1 might be possible? But ""ENTER"" has E at 1 and 4? Duplicate E? And N absent, so invalid.\n- ""UTTER"" is a possibility, but let\'s see if there are others without duplicates.\n\nAnother word: ""UTTER"" is one option.\n\nBut we can also consider ""APTER"" but A and P? A absent.\n\n""UTTER"" seems like a candidate.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word with different letters.\n\nFor example, ""STVER"" not a word.\n\n""STYER"" Y absent.\n\n""PTER"" not 5 letters.\n\n""ATER"" A absent.\n\nSo, common words: ""UTTER"" and perhaps ""DATER"" but A absent.\n\n""FEWER"" but F E W E R -> positions: 1:F, 2:E, but we need T at 2? We have T fixed at 2, so position 2 must be T. So ""FEWER"" has E at 2, which is not T. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, any word must have T at position 2.\n\nSo pattern: [letter] T [letter] E R\n\nWith available letters for position 1 and 3.\n\nPosition 1: can be D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W, etc.\n\nPosition 3: same, but must form a word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""UTTER"" - U at 1, T at 2, T at 3, E at 4, R at 5. So U and T (duplicate).\n- ""DETER"" - D E T E R -> but position 2 is E? We need T at 2. So invalid.\n- ""PETER"" - P E T E R -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.\n- ""SOWER"" - S O W E R -> O absent? O(x) from this guess. Invalid.\n- ""SUPER"" - S U P E R -> position 2 is U, not T. Invalid.\n- ""TAMER"" - T A M E R -> A and M absent, and position 1 is T? But we have T at 2, so position 1 cannot be T? We don\'t know, but T is at 2, so position 1 could be T? But we have T at 2 fixed, so if position 1 is T, that\'s duplicate. But ""TAMER"" has T at 1 and 2? Not, ""TAMER"" is T A M E R, so position 1: T, 2: A, but we need position 2 to be T, so not.\n\nWe need position 2 to be T, so the word must have T at 2.\n\nSo ""UTTER"" is a valid word: U T T E R.\n\nAnother possibility: ""BUTTER"" is 6 letters.\n\n""UTTER"" is 5 letters.\n\n""ETTER"" not a word? Or ""UTTER"" is the main one.\n\n""UTERI"" not, that\'s 5 but ends with I, not R.\n\nSo ""UTTER"" seems the most common.\n\nBut we have position 3 to fill, and in ""UTTER"" it\'s T.\n\nAnother word: ""APTER"" not.\n\n""OXTER"" but O absent.\n\n""FUTER"" not common.\n\n""JUTER"" not common.\n\n""VUTER"" not a word.\n\nSo ""UTTER"" is a common word that fits.\n\nWe can also consider ""DATER"" but A absent.\n\nSo I think ""UTTER"" is the word to guess.\n\nBut let\'s see if there are other options.\n\n""STERN"" but N absent and position 2 is T? ""STERN"" is S T E R N -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:R, 5:N -> but we need E at 4 and R at 5? Here E at 3 and R at 4, N at 5? Not matching.\n\n""STEER"" S T E E R -> positions: 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R -> but we have E at 4? Here position 4 is E, and R at 5, so that matches? But position 3 is E, which might be duplicate? And we need to check if E can be at 3? We have no feedback against E at 3.\n\nBut ""STEER"" has E at 3 and 4? So duplicate E.\n\nAnd S is available.\n\nBut we have the pattern: _ T _ E R, so for ""STEER"": position 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:E, 5:R -> so position 3 is E, which is a vowel.\n\nBut we don\'t know if E is duplicated.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHEER"" but H absent?

Invalid.\n\nSo ""STEER"" is another possibility.\n\nBut in ""STEER"", position 3 is E, which is a vowel, and we have E at 4.\n\nNow, we have two candidates: ""UTTER"" and ""STEER"".\n\nBut ""UTTER"" has U at 1 and T at 3, while ""STEER"" has S at 1 and E at 3.\n\nWe need to choose one to guess.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we can pick one that tests new letters.\n\nIn ""UTTER"", we test U and the possibility of duplicate T.\n\nIn ""STEER"", we test S and the possibility of duplicate E.\n\nBut we know E is at 4, and we don\'t know if it can be duplicated? Similarly for T.\n\nBut from feedback, we have no duplicate letters so far, so it might be single.\n\nBut we have to consider.\n\nAnother word: ""DIVER"" D I V E R -> but I absent? I(x) from TIMER.\n\n""GIVER"" G I V E R -> I absent.\n\n""LIVER"" L absent.\n\n""RIVER"" R I V E R -> I absent and duplicate R? R at 1 and 5? But we have R at 5 fixed, so duplicate possible?

So invalid.\n\nWe need position 2 to be T.\n\nSo back to ""UTTER"" and ""STEER"".\n\n""STEER"" has position 2 as T? Yes, S T E E R, so position 2 is T.\n\nPosition 1: S, position 3: E.\n\nBut E is at position 3, which is not 4, so it might be a different E? Or duplicate.\n\nSimilarly, ""UTTER"" has U at 1 and T at 3.\n\nNow, U and S are both available.\n\nWe can choose ""UTTER"" to test the duplicate T possibility.\n\nOr ""STEER"" for duplicate E.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from guess 4: we have T at 2 correct, so the word has T at 2.\n\nIf we guess ""UTTER"", and if the word is ""UTTER"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on U and the duplicate T.\n\nSimilarly for ""STEER"".\n\nBut there might be other words.\n\nAnother word: ""DETER"" but position 2 is E, not T.\n\n""TERRY"" not, ends with Y.\n\n""TERSE"" T E R S E -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.\n\n""TUNER"" T U N E R -> but N absent? N(x) from guess 1. And position 1 is T? But we have T at 2, so if position 1 is T, duplicate? ""TUNER"" has T at 1 and 2? Not, ""TUNER"" is T U N E R, so position 1:T, 2:U, but we need position 2 to be T, so not.\n\nWe need position 2 to be T, so the first letter can be any except T? Or duplicate? But in ""UTTER"", position 1 is U, not T.\n\nSo position 1 is not T, because if it were T, then in ""TIMER"" when we had T at 1, it was marked as present but wrong position, but now we know T is at 2, so position 1 cannot be T? Because if position 1 were T, then in ""TIMER"" (guess 3) T at 1 should have been correct? But it was marked as T(-), meaning present but wrong position, so T is not at position 1. Therefore, position 1 cannot be T. So no duplicate T at position 1.\n\nSimilarly, in the word, T is only at position 2? Or could be elsewhere? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""UTTER"", if we have T at 2 and T at 3, that\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, in ""STEER"", T at 2 and E at 3 and 4.\n\nBut for position 1, it cannot be T.\n\nSo for ""UTTER"", position 1 is U, which is not T.\n\nNow, let\'s list all possible words that fit _ T _ E R with available letters.\n\nAvailable letters for position 1: D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W (and others like K, but less common)\n\nFor position 3: same, but must form a word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""UTTER"" - U at 1, T at 3 (duplicate T)\n- ""STEER"" - S at 1, E at 3 (duplicate E)\n- ""DETER"" - D at 1, E at 3? But ""DETER"" is D E T E R -> position 2 is E, not T. Invalid.\n- ""PETER"" - P E T E R -> position 2 E, not T.\n- ""SKEET"" not ending with R.\n- ""SWEER"" not common.\n- ""FREER"" F R E E R -> position 2 is R, not T. Invalid.\n- ""GREET"" not ending with R.\n- ""KNEEL"" not.\n- ""QUEER"" position 2 U, not T.\n- ""SUPER"" position 2 U, not T.\n- ""TWIER"" not common.\n- ""VIEWR"" not a word.\n\nSo only ""UTTER"" and ""STEER"" seem common.\n\n""UTTER"" uses U and tests duplicate T.\n\n""STEER"" uses S and tests duplicate E.\n\nWe can choose ""UTTER"" because U is a vowel and might be more likely? Or S is common.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from guess 2: BERYL had E at 2 and it was wrong position, but that doesn\'t prevent E at 3.\n\nSimilarly, no feedback on U.\n\nI think both are possible.\n\nBut we have to guess one.\n\nPerhaps ""UTTER"" is better because it tests a new vowel U.\n\nOr ""STEER"" tests S, a common consonant.\n\nBut in ""STEER"", if we guess it, and if E is not duplicated, we might get E at 3 marked as absent or wrong position? But E is in the word at 4, so if there is no duplicate, E at 3 would be marked as absent? Or if present but wrong position? But E is at 4, so if position 3 is not E, then E at 3 would be marked as absent if no duplicate.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly for T in ""UTTER"".\n\nTo be safe, let\'s guess ""UTTER"".\n\nSo I\'ll go with that.\n\n<guess>UTTER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Feedback from Previous Guesses:**\n   - **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  \n     - Absent letters: C, A, N  \n     - R and E are present but misplaced (R not in position 2, E not in position 5).\n   - **Guess 2 (BERYL)**: B(x), E(-), R(-), Y(x), L(x)  \n     - Absent letters: B, Y, L  \n     - E and R are present but misplaced (E not in position 2, R not in position 3).\n   - **Guess 3 (TIMER)**: T(-), I(x), M(x), E(✓), R(✓)  \n     - Absent letters: I, M  \n     - E and R are correct at positions 4 and 5 (so the word ends with ""ER"").  \n     - T is present but not in position 1.\n   - **Guess 4 (OTHER)**: O(x), T(✓), H(x), E(✓), R(✓)  \n     - Absent letters: O, H  \n     - T is correct at position 2, E at 4, R at 5 (so the word pattern is `_ T _ E R`).  \n     - O and H are absent.\n\n2. **Key Insights:**\n   - **Fixed positions**: Position 2 is T, position 4 is E, position 5 is R. The word structure is `_ T _ E R`.\n   - **Absent letters**: A, B, C, H, I, L, M, N, O, Y (all ruled out from feedback).\n   - **Present letters to include**: T, E, R are confirmed (with E and R fixed at positions 4–5, and T fixed at position 2). No new letters are confirmed beyond these, but we must fill positions 1 and 3.\n   - **Constraints**:\n     - Position 1 cannot be T (from Guess 3 feedback: T not in position 1).\n     - Position 3 cannot reuse E or R (since duplicates are possible but not confirmed; we need to test new letters).\n     - Available letters for positions 1 and 3: D, F, G, P, S, U, V, W, and less common letters like J, K, Q, X, Z (but prioritize common English letters).\n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess:**\n   - **Goal**: Solve the word by testing likely letters for positions 1 and 3, while maximizing information if the guess is incorrect.\n   - **Pattern**: `_ T _ E R` (e.g., words like ""UTTER"" or ""STEER"").\n   - **Prioritize common words**: Focus on high-frequency letters (e.g., S, U, P, D) to cover likely candidates.\n   - **Key candidate**: ""UTTER"" fits the pattern perfectly:\n     - Position 1: U (common vowel, not tested yet).\n     - Position 3: T (tests for duplicate T, which is possible based on Wordle rules).\n     - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, feedback on U and the duplicate T will reveal the solution.\n   - **Why not other words?** \n     - ""STEER"" (S at position 1, E at position 3) is possible but tests E duplication, which is less likely given E is fixed at position 4 and hasn\'t shown duplication hints.

We have feedback from the fifth guess: UTTER -> U(x) T(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓)

This tells us:
- U is not in the word (absent).
- The first T (position 2) is correct and in the right place.
- The second T (position 3) is in the word but not in that position (so there is at least one more T elsewhere? But note: we already have T fixed at position 2; this feedback for position 3 says T is present but wrong position, meaning it cannot be at position 3, but we already know T is at position 2. Since the second T is marked as present but wrong position, it implies there is a duplicate T somewhere else. However, we must reconsider: the word has a T at position 2 (fixed), and the feedback for position 3 (T) is ""-"", meaning there is another T in the word that is not at position 3. But since the word pattern is _ T _ E R, and we have T at 2, the only possibility for another T is at position 1 or position 3? Position 3 is wrong, so if there's a duplicate, it must be at position 1? But position 1 cannot be T because earlier feedback (from guess 3) showed T not at position 1.

Recall: In Guess 3 (TIMER), T was in position 1 and we got T(-), meaning T is not at position 1. Therefore, position 1 cannot be T. So how can there be a duplicate T?

Alternatively, perhaps the duplicate T is not in the word? But the feedback shows T(-) for position 3, meaning that the word does contain a T that is not at position 3. Since we have T at position 2 (correct), that accounts for one T. The ""-"" for the second T (position 3) would typically indicate that there is a second T in the word that is not at position 3. However, the only remaining positions are 1 and 3? But position 3 is already the letter in question, and we know position 1 cannot be T (from previous feedback). So unless the word has three T's? That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the feedback logic: when we guess a letter that appears multiple times, the feedback marks duplicates appropriately. In this case, we guessed ""UTTER"" which has two T's. The first T (position 2) is correct, so it gets a ✓. The second T (position 3) is not correct at that position, and since there is only one T in the secret word (at position 2), it should be marked as not present? But no, according to rules: if a letter is in the wrong position and there is only one occurrence in the word, you mark it as wrong position only if there is no other correct occurrence? I need to verify the rules.

The rules: 
- ✓: correct letter in correct position.
- -: the letter is in the word but in wrong position.
- x: letter not in the word.

For duplicate letters:
- If the secret word has one T and you guess two T's, then one T might be correct (if at right position) and the other might be marked as absent if there's only one T in the word. But in this feedback, we have T(✓) for position 2 and T(-) for position 3. This suggests that there is a second T in the word that is not at position 3? Or is the feedback inconsistent?

But our secret word has T at position 2. We used two T's in the guess: one at position 2 and one at position 3. Since position 2 is correct, it gets ✓. The T at position 3 is:
- If the word has only one T at position 2, then the T at position 3 should be marked as absent (x) because there is no extra T? Or if the word has a T at another position? 

But we know position 1 cannot be T (from guess 3), and positions 4 and 5 are E and R. So there cannot be a T at position 1. Therefore, the word cannot have another T. Thus, the T at position 3 in the guess should be marked as absent? But the feedback is T(-), which means that the letter is present but in the wrong position. This implies that the secret word must have at least two T's? But we have no position for the second T since positions are fixed except 1 and 3.

If the secret word had two T's, one at position 2 and one at... position 3? But the feedback says T(-) for position 3? That would mean it's wrong position? So it cannot be at position 3. So if not at 1,2,3,4,5, impossible?

Wait: What are the possible positions for the second T? The word has 5 positions: 
- Position 1: cannot be T (from guess 3: T not at 1).
- Position 2: T (correct).
- Position 3: we guessed T, but it's marked as wrong position? So there should be a T elsewhere? But position 4 is E, 5 is R. So no other positions? Therefore, the feedback might be inconsistent? Or we misunderstood.

Perhaps the feedback system: when a letter is guessed more than once, the feedback might prioritize the correct position first. So for T, since position 2 is correct, one T is accounted for. The other T at position 3 is extra and should be marked as absent because there's no second T in the word. But in this case, it was marked as ""-"", which would be a mistake? That can't be.

Another possibility: the secret word has only one T, and the feedback should have been T(✓) for position 2 and T(x) for position 3? But it was T(-), so there must be a second T elsewhere? But there is no elsewhere.

Unless we are missing something: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? But positions 4 and 5 are fixed as E and R, so they cannot be T. Position 1: cannot be T. Position 3: not T (because if it were T, then we would have two T's? But then the feedback for position 3 might be confusing.

Consider the word ""UTTER"" as candidate:

Secret word: if it were ""UTTER"", then:
- Position 1: U (if secret has U, but U(x) from feedback, so U is absent).
- But feedback says U(x), so secret word does not have U.
- Therefore, ""UTTER"" cannot be the secret word because it has U.

So secret word is not ""UTTER"". 

Then, the feedback: U(x) T(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓)

What does T(-) at position 3 mean? It means that the letter T at position 3 is in the word but not at that position. But we already have T at position 2 (one occurrence). So there must be at least one more T in the word, and it must be at a different position.

But the available positions are only position 1 and 3? We know:
- Position 1 cannot be T (from guess 3: T not at position 1).
- Position 3: if we place T there, but the feedback says T(-) for position 3, meaning it is not at position 3? So it can't be there.

And positions 4 and 5 are E and R, fixed.

Therefore, contradiction? 

Unless the secret word has T at position 1? But that can't be because guess 3 had T at 1 and it was marked wrong position? But we know T is at position 2, so if secret had T at position 1 and 2, then in guess 3 (TIMER), we had T at position 1 and it should be correct? But it was marked as T(-), meaning it is present but wrong position? For T at position 1 to be marked as wrong position, it must be that position 1 is not T in the secret word? So secret word cannot have T at position 1.

Alternatively, if the secret word has T at position 2 and also at position 3? Then for our guess ""UTTER"":
- Secret word: ... T T E R ... 
- Guessed: U T T E R
- Feedback:
  - Position 1: U vs ? (if secret has U? But U(x), so secret position 1 is not U.
  - Position 2: T vs T: ✓.
  - Position 3: T vs T: should be ✓, but feedback is T(-)? No, if both are T, then it should be ✓ for position 3 too. But it was T(-), which is wrong position, not correct. So it can't be that position 3 is T in the secret.

So this is confusing.

Let's reinterpret the feedback. The guess is ""UTTER"", which has letters: U, T, T, E, R.

Feedback: U(x) T(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓)

- U is completely absent: so no U in the secret.
- First T (at position 2) is not only present but in the correct position: so secret has T at position 2.
- Second T (at position 3) is present in the secret but not in that position: so there is another T in the secret, but not at position 3.
- E and R are correct at positions 4 and 5.

But where can this other T be? The only positions left are 1 and 3. Position 3 is already at this position and we are told it's not there, so position 3 cannot be T. Position 1: but position 1 cannot have T because of guess 3 feedback.

Conclusion: the secret must have T at position 2 (given) and at least one more T. But the only other position available is position 1? But position 1 cannot be in the secret because of the prior feedback from guess 3. Thus, there is an inconsistency, or we must consider that position 1 might have T after all? But the feedback from guess 3 explicitly says T at position 1 is not correct position, but the letter T is in the word? But now we are placing it at position 1? That might be possible if the secret has two T's: one at position 1 and one at position 2.

But in guess 3 (TIMER), if the secret has T at position 1 and 2, and we guess TIMER (which has T at position 1), then the feedback for position 1 should be T(✓) because it is correct? But we got T(-), which means it is present but wrong position. But if the secret has position 1 as T, it should be ✓.

Therefore, secret cannot have T at position 1.

So we are stuck.

Perhaps the feedback for position 3 T(-) means that the letter T at position 3 is correct if there is a matching T, but in this case, it is not at the right position? But if secret has only one T at position 2, the second T in the guess (position 3) should be marked as absent? But it was marked as present but wrong position, implying there is another T not found yet? But there is no other position.

Unless the secret word has a T at position 1, but that's not possible because of guess 3 feedback.

The only logical resolution is that the secret word has only one T, and the feedback for position 3 is a mistake, or we have a misinterpretation. Given, we should trust the feedback.

Another idea: perhaps the word has a T at position 1, but in guess 3, we had other letters that caused confusion? But guess 3: TIMER, secret with T at position 1 and 2? Then:
- Position 1: T vs T: ✓.
- Position 2: I vs T? But secret has T at 2, so I should be compared to T? But I is not T, and it should be whatever is at position 2 in secret? Assume secret has T at 1 and 2: so positions: T T I (secret has T at 1 and ?)? No.

Assume secret word is e.g., ""TATER"", but A is absent.

Suppose for this secret: We have guess 3: TIMER -> secret if ""T? something?"", complicated.

Perhaps for our current state, in guess 5, the T(-) for position 3 means that there is a T in the secret at a different position that we haven't guessed? But positions 1,4,5 are taken or fixed. Position 4 is E, 5 is R, position 1 is unknown.

Therefore, the only possibility is that position 1 is T? But that contradicts guess 3.

Unless guess 3's feedback was for a different reason. In guess 3, we had TIMER:
- Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:M, 4:E, 5:R
- Feedback: T(-) for position 1, meaning T is in the word but not at position 1.
But if the secret has T at position 1, feedback should be T(✓). So it can't be.

So we come back on contradiction.

Perhaps the secret word has T at position 2 and T at position 4 or 5? But position 4 is E (correct) and position 5 is R (correct), so they can't be T.

Therefore, the feedback T(-) for position 3 is not possible if there's no other position for T. So I think the only possibility is that the secret has only one T, but the feedback marked it as present at wrong position for the second T, which is a common error in interpretation? Or in this game, it should be x for the second T.

But the feedback we have is U(x) T(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓), so we must work with that.

Perhaps it mean the secret has at least two T's, and one is at position 2, the other is not at position 3, so it must be at position 1? But position 1 can't be T, so we have to assume that position 1 might be T and the guess 3 feedback was for a different reason.

But that's unsound.

Let's list what we know for sure:
- The word is _ T _ E R
- Position 1: cannot be U (U x), cannot be T (based on guess 3? or we revisit)
- Position 3: cannot be T, because according to feedback T(-) for position 3, it means it is not in the correct position, and since there's only one T in the word or by position? But the feedback says it's present but wrong position, so the secret has this letter? So T is in the secret, and it's not at position 3. But we have T at position 2, so there must be another T elsewhere.

For the sake of this game, let's assume that the secret has two T's, and the we are missing position 1 and 3.

Position 1: must be a letter that is not U, not O, not H, not A,B,C,I,L,M,N,Y, and not T? But T is in the word at position 2, but position 1 could be T? But guess 3 says T at position 1 is wrong position? That can't be if it's correct.

Ignore guess 3 for a moment.

The available letters for position 1: from absent list: A,B,C,H,I,L,M,N,O,U,Y. So not any of these. Also from guess 5: U is absent, so added.

So position 1 can be: D, F, G, P, S, V, W, etc.

Position 3: similarly, and not T? Because if we trust the feedback for position 3 is T(-), it means that position 3 is not T in the secret, so we need a different letter for position 3.

But since the secret has another T besides position 2, and the only other position is position 1 or 3, and position 3 is not T (because of the feedback), so position 1 must be T.

Therefore, despite guess 3, we have to conclude position 1 is T.

But guess 3: TIMER with T at position 1 got T(-)? Then, if secret has T at position 1, it should be

Our secret word: position 1 is T? Then in guess 3, we guessed T at position 1, but feedback was T(-), which is not possible if position 1 is T.

So perhaps the secret has only one T, and the feedback for guess 5 is anomalous.

Given the feedback, we must proceed.

So for guess 6, the last guess, we need to guess the word.

The pattern: 1: must be one letter, 3: another letter, with the constraint that the word has T at position 2, E at 4, R at 5, and one more T at some position.

After position 1 must be the second T? But then position 1 is T, which we haven't tested.

Assume the word has position 1: T, position 2: T, position 3: ?, position 4: E, position 5: R.

But then the word is T T ? E R.

This should have been our guess in guess 5? But we guessed ""UTTER"", which is U T T E R, so if secret is ""T T _ E R"", then:
- Position 1: U vs T: U(x) because U missing.
- Position 2: T vs T: ✓.
- Position 3: T vs ? so if position 3 is not T, then T at position 3 should be x or -? If secret position 3 is say K, then T at position 3 in guess should be x, but it was -, so secret must have T elsewhere.

For secret ""T T K E R"", guess ""U T T E R"":
- Position 1: U not T -> x.
- Position 2: T == T -> ✓.
- Position 3: T vs K -> not T, and secret has T at position 1 and 2, so there is another T? Secret has two T's already, position 1 and 2. When we guess T at position 3, it is extra, and since secret has only two T's both used, it should be marked as absent? But feedback says T(-), which implies it is present but wrong position. So it should be marked as x.

  This is not matching.

Unless the secret has three T's? But not at position 4 or 5.

So ""T T T E R"" is not a word.

Therefore, I think the only way is to abandon the duplicate idea and assume that the T(-) for position 3 means that position 3 is not T, and there is no second T, so the feedback should have been T(x) for position 3.

But since it was given as T(-), there must be a second T at position 1. And we have to ignore the guess 3 feedback or attribute it to an error.

So for the sake of this, let's assume position 1 can be T.

 Then the word is T T ? E R.

Position 3 must be a letter from available: not absent letters, so D, F, G, P, S, V, W, etc.

But "" T T P E R ""? Not a word.

"" T T S E R "" not.

"" not The only word might be "" T T I E R ""? But I is absent.

""ETTER"" not.

 so no common word with T at position 1 and 2.

 Perhaps position 3 is E, but position 4 is E, duplicate.

Secret "" T T E E R ""? Is "" character not.

 so not.

Therefore, perhaps the only possibility is that the secret has our T at position 2, and no second T, but the feedback for position 3 should be x, not -.

  Given that, we must you for position 3 a different letter.

We try to guess a word with position 3 being a letter from available list.

For example, position 3: P or S or D.

Position 1: S or P or D.

Common word: ""STPER"" not.

"" STEP R"" not.

"" STEEP"" not, has two E's.

 but we need _ T _ E R.

 so ""  T P E R "" like "" TAPER "" but A absent.

"" T D E R "" not

 it'S hard.

"" S T S E R "" not.

 Perhaps "" STORE"" but position 2 is not T? We have to have T at 2.

So position 1 and 3.

 Words: ""DATER"" - gone.

The most common (non- duplicate T) word might be ""STEER"" but that has two E's.

""STEER"": S T E E R

- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

This would work if the secret has E at position 3, but we have E at position 4. So duplicate E.

In feedback for ""STEER"", the first E (position 3) might be marked as "" or absent or wrong position.

But for our current guess, we have to guess for position 3 a letter.

Based on available letters, for ""STEER"", if secret also has duplicate E, it is possible.

Or ""SHeer"" H absent.

 I think ""STEER"" is a good guess for the sixth try.

Then, feedback let's assume.

Or ""fiery"" not.

 So will guess ""STEER"".

<guess>STEER</guess> 

But see the feedback we got for guess 5: T at position 3 in ""UTTER"" was T(-), which suggests there is an additional T, but if we guess ""STEER"", we don't have a second T, so we might not address that.

 But we have no better choice.

 Perhaps the secret is ""Twerk"" not.
</think>
Based on the feedback from all guesses, the confirmed structure of the secret word is `_ T _ E R` (T in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5). From Guess 5 (UTTER), we have:
- U is absent (`U(x)`), ruling out U.
- The first T (position 2) is correct (`T(✓)`).
- The second T (position 3) is marked `T(-)`, indicating the word contains at least two T's, but the second T is not at position 3.
- E and R are confirmed at positions 4 and 5 (`E(✓)`, `R(✓)`).

Given the constraints:
- **Position 1**: Cannot be T (from Guess 3 where T was misplaced at position 1), and must be an available letter. Absent letters include A, B, C, H, I, L, M, N, O, U, Y (per all feedback), so available options are D, F, G, P, S, V, W, etc.
- **Position 3**: Must be a letter that is not T (since `T(-)` indicates T is not at position 3), and the word has a duplicate T elsewhere. Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed (E, R), position 1 must contain the second T, despite the prior constraint from Guess 3. However, this creates a conflict, as Guess 3's `T(-)` at position 1 would be inconsistent if position 1 is T. Re-evaluating, the only logical resolution is that the secret word has no second T, and the `T(-)` feedback for position 3 is incorrect-marked; it should be `T(x)` since there is no duplicate T. Thus, position 3 is likely a different letter.
- **Available letters for position 1 and 3**: D, F, G, P, S, V, W, etc. (common choices like S, P).

Common words fitting `_ T _ E R`:
- ""STEER"" (S at position 1, E at position 3) tests S and E duplication (E possible at position 3, given E is fixed at 4).
- Other options like ""UTTER"" were eliminated (U absent).

For Guess 6, ""STEER"" is chosen because:
- It respects the fixes: T at 2, E at 4, R at 5.
- It tests S at position 1 and E at position 3 (possible duplicate E).
- Feedback will resolve if S is present/absent and if E can be at position 3.

<guess>STEER</guess>",STEER,"We have feedback from the fifth guess: UTTER -> U(x) T(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓)

This tells us:
- U is not in the word (absent).
- The first T (position 2) is correct and in the right place.
- The second T (position 3) is in the word but not in that position (so there is at least one more T elsewhere? But note: we already have T fixed at position 2; this feedback for position 3 says T is present but wrong position, meaning it cannot be at position 3, but we already know T is at position 2. Since the second T is marked as present but wrong position, it implies there is a duplicate T somewhere else. However, we must reconsider: the word has a T at position 2 (fixed), and the feedback for position 3 (T) is ""-"", meaning there is another T in the word that is not at position 3. But since the word pattern is _ T _ E R, and we have T at 2, the only possibility for another T is at position 1 or position 3? Position 3 is wrong, so if there's a duplicate, it must be at position 1? But position 1 cannot be T because earlier feedback (from guess 3) showed T not at position 1.

Recall: In Guess 3 (TIMER), T was in position 1 and we got T(-), meaning T is not at position 1. Therefore, position 1 cannot be T. So how can there be a duplicate T?

Alternatively, perhaps the duplicate T is not in the word? But the feedback shows T(-) for position 3, meaning that the word does contain a T that is not at position 3. Since we have T at position 2 (correct), that accounts for one T. The ""-"" for the second T (position 3) would typically indicate that there is a second T in the word that is not at position 3. However, the only remaining positions are 1 and 3? But position 3 is already the letter in question, and we know position 1 cannot be T (from previous feedback). So unless the word has three T's? That seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the feedback logic: when we guess a letter that appears multiple times, the feedback marks duplicates appropriately. In this case, we guessed ""UTTER"" which has two T's. The first T (position 2) is correct, so it gets a ✓. The second T (position 3) is not correct at that position, and since there is only one T in the secret word (at position 2), it should be marked as not present? But no, according to rules: if a letter is in the wrong position and there is only one occurrence in the word, you mark it as wrong position only if there is no other correct occurrence? I need to verify the rules.

The rules: 
- ✓: correct letter in correct position.
- -: the letter is in the word but in wrong position.
- x: letter not in the word.

For duplicate letters:
- If the secret word has one T and you guess two T's, then one T might be correct (if at right position) and the other might be marked as absent if there's only one T in the word. But in this feedback, we have T(✓) for position 2 and T(-) for position 3. This suggests that there is a second T in the word that is not at position 3? Or is the feedback inconsistent?

But our secret word has T at position 2. We used two T's in the guess: one at position 2 and one at position 3. Since position 2 is correct, it gets ✓. The T at position 3 is:
- If the word has only one T at position 2, then the T at position 3 should be marked as absent (x) because there is no extra T? Or if the word has a T at another position? 

But we know position 1 cannot be T (from guess 3), and positions 4 and 5 are E and R. So there cannot be a T at position 1. Therefore, the word cannot have another T. Thus, the T at position 3 in the guess should be marked as absent? But the feedback is T(-), which means that the letter is present but in the wrong position. This implies that the secret word must have at least two T's? But we have no position for the second T since positions are fixed except 1 and 3.

If the secret word had two T's, one at position 2 and one at... position 3? But the feedback says T(-) for position 3? That would mean it's wrong position? So it cannot be at position 3. So if not at 1,2,3,4,5, impossible?

Wait: What are the possible positions for the second T? The word has 5 positions: 
- Position 1: cannot be T (from guess 3: T not at 1).
- Position 2: T (correct).
- Position 3: we guessed T, but it's marked as wrong position? So there should be a T elsewhere? But position 4 is E, 5 is R. So no other positions? Therefore, the feedback might be inconsistent? Or we misunderstood.

Perhaps the feedback system: when a letter is guessed more than once, the feedback might prioritize the correct position first. So for T, since position 2 is correct, one T is accounted for. The other T at position 3 is extra and should be marked as absent because there's no second T in the word. But in this case, it was marked as ""-"", which would be a mistake? That can't be.

Another possibility: the secret word has only one T, and the feedback should have been T(✓) for position 2 and T(x) for position 3? But it was T(-), so there must be a second T elsewhere? But there is no elsewhere.

Unless we are missing something: what if the secret word has duplicate letters? But positions 4 and 5 are fixed as E and R, so they cannot be T. Position 1: cannot be T. Position 3: not T (because if it were T, then we would have two T's? But then the feedback for position 3 might be confusing.

Consider the word ""UTTER"" as candidate:

Secret word: if it were ""UTTER"", then:
- Position 1: U (if secret has U, but U(x) from feedback, so U is absent).
- But feedback says U(x), so secret word does not have U.
- Therefore, ""UTTER"" cannot be the secret word because it has U.

So secret word is not ""UTTER"". 

Then, the feedback: U(x) T(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓)

What does T(-) at position 3 mean? It means that the letter T at position 3 is in the word but not at that position. But we already have T at position 2 (one occurrence). So there must be at least one more T in the word, and it must be at a different position.

But the available positions are only position 1 and 3? We know:
- Position 1 cannot be T (from guess 3: T not at position 1).
- Position 3: if we place T there, but the feedback says T(-) for position 3, meaning it is not at position 3? So it can't be there.

And positions 4 and 5 are E and R, fixed.

Therefore, contradiction? 

Unless the secret word has T at position 1? But that can't be because guess 3 had T at 1 and it was marked wrong position? But we know T is at position 2, so if secret had T at position 1 and 2, then in guess 3 (TIMER), we had T at position 1 and it should be correct? But it was marked as T(-), meaning it is present but wrong position? For T at position 1 to be marked as wrong position, it must be that position 1 is not T in the secret word? So secret word cannot have T at position 1.

Alternatively, if the secret word has T at position 2 and also at position 3? Then for our guess ""UTTER"":
- Secret word: ... T T E R ... 
- Guessed: U T T E R
- Feedback:
  - Position 1: U vs ? (if secret has U? But U(x), so secret position 1 is not U.
  - Position 2: T vs T: ✓.
  - Position 3: T vs T: should be ✓, but feedback is T(-)? No, if both are T, then it should be ✓ for position 3 too. But it was T(-), which is wrong position, not correct. So it can't be that position 3 is T in the secret.

So this is confusing.

Let's reinterpret the feedback. The guess is ""UTTER"", which has letters: U, T, T, E, R.

Feedback: U(x) T(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓)

- U is completely absent: so no U in the secret.
- First T (at position 2) is not only present but in the correct position: so secret has T at position 2.
- Second T (at position 3) is present in the secret but not in that position: so there is another T in the secret, but not at position 3.
- E and R are correct at positions 4 and 5.

But where can this other T be? The only positions left are 1 and 3. Position 3 is already at this position and we are told it's not there, so position 3 cannot be T. Position 1: but position 1 cannot have T because of guess 3 feedback.

Conclusion: the secret must have T at position 2 (given) and at least one more T. But the only other position available is position 1? But position 1 cannot be in the secret because of the prior feedback from guess 3. Thus, there is an inconsistency, or we must consider that position 1 might have T after all? But the feedback from guess 3 explicitly says T at position 1 is not correct position, but the letter T is in the word? But now we are placing it at position 1? That might be possible if the secret has two T's: one at position 1 and one at position 2.

But in guess 3 (TIMER), if the secret has T at position 1 and 2, and we guess TIMER (which has T at position 1), then the feedback for position 1 should be T(✓) because it is correct? But we got T(-), which means it is present but wrong position. But if the secret has position 1 as T, it should be ✓.

Therefore, secret cannot have T at position 1.

So we are stuck.

Perhaps the feedback for position 3 T(-) means that the letter T at position 3 is correct if there is a matching T, but in this case, it is not at the right position? But if secret has only one T at position 2, the second T in the guess (position 3) should be marked as absent? But it was marked as present but wrong position, implying there is another T not found yet? But there is no other position.

Unless the secret word has a T at position 1, but that's not possible because of guess 3 feedback.

The only logical resolution is that the secret word has only one T, and the feedback for position 3 is a mistake, or we have a misinterpretation. Given, we should trust the feedback.

Another idea: perhaps the word has a T at position 1, but in guess 3, we had other letters that caused confusion? But guess 3: TIMER, secret with T at position 1 and 2? Then:
- Position 1: T vs T: ✓.
- Position 2: I vs T? But secret has T at 2, so I should be compared to T? But I is not T, and it should be whatever is at position 2 in secret? Assume secret has T at 1 and 2: so positions: T T I (secret has T at 1 and ?)? No.

Assume secret word is e.g., ""TATER"", but A is absent.

Suppose for this secret: We have guess 3: TIMER -> secret if ""T? something?"", complicated.

Perhaps for our current state, in guess 5, the T(-) for position 3 means that there is a T in the secret at a different position that we haven't guessed? But positions 1,4,5 are taken or fixed. Position 4 is E, 5 is R, position 1 is unknown.

Therefore, the only possibility is that position 1 is T? But that contradicts guess 3.

Unless guess 3's feedback was for a different reason. In guess 3, we had TIMER:
- Positions: 1:T, 2:I, 3:M, 4:E, 5:R
- Feedback: T(-) for position 1, meaning T is in the word but not at position 1.
But if the secret has T at position 1, feedback should be T(✓). So it can't be.

So we come back on contradiction.

Perhaps the secret word has T at position 2 and T at position 4 or 5? But position 4 is E (correct) and position 5 is R (correct), so they can't be T.

Therefore, the feedback T(-) for position 3 is not possible if there's no other position for T. So I think the only possibility is that the secret has only one T, but the feedback marked it as present at wrong position for the second T, which is a common error in interpretation? Or in this game, it should be x for the second T.

But the feedback we have is U(x) T(✓) T(-) E(✓) R(✓), so we must work with that.

Perhaps it mean the secret has at least two T's, and one is at position 2, the other is not at position 3, so it must be at position 1? But position 1 can't be T, so we have to assume that position 1 might be T and the guess 3 feedback was for a different reason.

But that's unsound.

Let's list what we know for sure:
- The word is _ T _ E R
- Position 1: cannot be U (U x), cannot be T (based on guess 3? or we revisit)
- Position 3: cannot be T, because according to feedback T(-) for position 3, it means it is not in the correct position, and since there's only one T in the word or by position? But the feedback says it's present but wrong position, so the secret has this letter? So T is in the secret, and it's not at position 3. But we have T at position 2, so there must be another T elsewhere.

For the sake of this game, let's assume that the secret has two T's, and the we are missing position 1 and 3.

Position 1: must be a letter that is not U, not O, not H, not A,B,C,I,L,M,N,Y, and not T? But T is in the word at position 2, but position 1 could be T? But guess 3 says T at position 1 is wrong position? That can't be if it's correct.

Ignore guess 3 for a moment.

The available letters for position 1: from absent list: A,B,C,H,I,L,M,N,O,U,Y. So not any of these. Also from guess 5: U is absent, so added.

So position 1 can be: D, F, G, P, S, V, W, etc.

Position 3: similarly, and not T? Because if we trust the feedback for position 3 is T(-), it means that position 3 is not T in the secret, so we need a different letter for position 3.

But since the secret has another T besides position 2, and the only other position is position 1 or 3, and position 3 is not T (because of the feedback), so position 1 must be T.

Therefore, despite guess 3, we have to conclude position 1 is T.

But guess 3: TIMER with T at position 1 got T(-)? Then, if secret has T at position 1, it should be

Our secret word: position 1 is T? Then in guess 3, we guessed T at position 1, but feedback was T(-), which is not possible if position 1 is T.

So perhaps the secret has only one T, and the feedback for guess 5 is anomalous.

Given the feedback, we must proceed.

So for guess 6, the last guess, we need to guess the word.

The pattern: 1: must be one letter, 3: another letter, with the constraint that the word has T at position 2, E at 4, R at 5, and one more T at some position.

After position 1 must be the second T? But then position 1 is T, which we haven't tested.

Assume the word has position 1: T, position 2: T, position 3: ?, position 4: E, position 5: R.

But then the word is T T ? E R.

This should have been our guess in guess 5? But we guessed ""UTTER"", which is U T T E R, so if secret is ""T T _ E R"", then:
- Position 1: U vs T: U(x) because U missing.
- Position 2: T vs T: ✓.
- Position 3: T vs ? so if position 3 is not T, then T at position 3 should be x or -? If secret position 3 is say K, then T at position 3 in guess should be x, but it was -, so secret must have T elsewhere.

For secret ""T T K E R"", guess ""U T T E R"":
- Position 1: U not T -> x.
- Position 2: T == T -> ✓.
- Position 3: T vs K -> not T, and secret has T at position 1 and 2, so there is another T? Secret has two T's already, position 1 and 2. When we guess T at position 3, it is extra, and since secret has only two T's both used, it should be marked as absent? But feedback says T(-), which implies it is present but wrong position. So it should be marked as x.

  This is not matching.

Unless the secret has three T's? But not at position 4 or 5.

So ""T T T E R"" is not a word.

Therefore, I think the only way is to abandon the duplicate idea and assume that the T(-) for position 3 means that position 3 is not T, and there is no second T, so the feedback should have been T(x) for position 3.

But since it was given as T(-), there must be a second T at position 1. And we have to ignore the guess 3 feedback or attribute it to an error.

So for the sake of this, let's assume position 1 can be T.

 Then the word is T T ? E R.

Position 3 must be a letter from available: not absent letters, so D, F, G, P, S, V, W, etc.

But "" T T P E R ""? Not a word.

"" T T S E R "" not.

"" not The only word might be "" T T I E R ""? But I is absent.

""ETTER"" not.

 so no common word with T at position 1 and 2.

 Perhaps position 3 is E, but position 4 is E, duplicate.

Secret "" T T E E R ""? Is "" character not.

 so not.

Therefore, perhaps the only possibility is that the secret has our T at position 2, and no second T, but the feedback for position 3 should be x, not -.

  Given that, we must you for position 3 a different letter.

We try to guess a word with position 3 being a letter from available list.

For example, position 3: P or S or D.

Position 1: S or P or D.

Common word: ""STPER"" not.

"" STEP R"" not.

"" STEEP"" not, has two E's.

 but we need _ T _ E R.

 so ""  T P E R "" like "" TAPER "" but A absent.

"" T D E R "" not

 it'S hard.

"" S T S E R "" not.

 Perhaps "" STORE"" but position 2 is not T? We have to have T at 2.

So position 1 and 3.

 Words: ""DATER"" - gone.

The most common (non- duplicate T) word might be ""STEER"" but that has two E's.

""STEER"": S T E E R

- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

This would work if the secret has E at position 3, but we have E at position 4. So duplicate E.

In feedback for ""STEER"", the first E (position 3) might be marked as "" or absent or wrong position.

But for our current guess, we have to guess for position 3 a letter.

Based on available letters, for ""STEER"", if secret also has duplicate E, it is possible.

Or ""SHeer"" H absent.

 I think ""STEER"" is a good guess for the sixth try.

Then, feedback let's assume.

Or ""fiery"" not.

 So will guess ""STEER"".

<guess>STEER</guess> 

But see the feedback we got for guess 5: T at position 3 in ""UTTER"" was T(-), which suggests there is an additional T, but if we guess ""STEER"", we don't have a second T, so we might not address that.

 But we have no better choice.

 Perhaps the secret is ""Twerk"" not.Based on the feedback from all guesses, the confirmed structure of the secret word is `_ T _ E R` (T in position 2, E in position 4, R in position 5). From Guess 5 (UTTER), we have:
- U is absent (`U(x)`), ruling out U.
- The first T (position 2) is correct (`T(✓)`).
- The second T (position 3) is marked `T(-)`, indicating the word contains at least two T's, but the second T is not at position 3.
- E and R are confirmed at positions 4 and 5 (`E(✓)`, `R(✓)`).

Given the constraints:
- **Position 1**: Cannot be T (from Guess 3 where T was misplaced at position 1), and must be an available letter. Absent letters include A, B, C, H, I, L, M, N, O, U, Y (per all feedback), so available options are D, F, G, P, S, V, W, etc.
- **Position 3**: Must be a letter that is not T (since `T(-)` indicates T is not at position 3), and the word has a duplicate T elsewhere. Since positions 4 and 5 are fixed (E, R), position 1 must contain the second T, despite the prior constraint from Guess 3. However, this creates a conflict, as Guess 3's `T(-)` at position 1 would be inconsistent if position 1 is T. Re-evaluating, the only logical resolution is that the secret word has no second T, and the `T(-)` feedback for position 3 is incorrect-marked; it should be `T(x)` since there is no duplicate T. Thus, position 3 is likely a different letter.
- **Available letters for position 1 and 3**: D, F, G, P, S, V, W, etc. (common choices like S, P).

Common words fitting `_ T _ E R`:
- ""STEER"" (S at position 1, E at position 3) tests S and E duplication (E possible at position 3, given E is fixed at 4).
- Other options like ""UTTER"" were eliminated (U absent).

For Guess 6, ""STEER"" is chosen because:
- It respects the fixes: T at 2, E at 4, R at 5.
- It tests S at position 1 and E at position 3 (possible duplicate E).
- Feedback will resolve if S is present/absent and if E can be at position 3.",Guess 6: STEER -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
