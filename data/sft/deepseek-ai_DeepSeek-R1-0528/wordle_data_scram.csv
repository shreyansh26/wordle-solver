We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the word but in the wrong position)
 R: - (R is in the word but wrong position)
 A: - (A is in the word but wrong position)
 N: x (N is not in the word)
 E: x (E is not in the word)

 So, we know:
 - The secret word contains the letters C, R, and A, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"".
 - The secret word does not contain N or E.

 Since the word is 5 letters, and we have 3 confirmed letters (C, R, A) and two absent letters (N, E).

 We also know that the positions of C, R, A in ""crane"" (which are 1st, 2nd, and 3rd) are incorrect for these letters.

 Therefore, in the secret word:
 - C cannot be in position 1.
 - R cannot be in position 2.
 - A cannot be in position 3.

 We need to make a second guess that includes C, R, and A (since they are in the word) and avoids N and E.

 Also, we should try to place C, R, A in positions that are different from the first guess.

 Let's think of words that have C, R, A and two other letters that are not N or E. Also, we should avoid placing C in position 1, R in position 2, and A in position 3.

 We have 6 tries, so we can try to get more information.

 We can try a word that rearranges C, R, A and adds two new letters to test.

 Since we don't know the other two letters, we can choose common consonants.

 Let's consider: 
 - We have to avoid positions: C not at 1, R not at 2, A not at 3.

 Possible positions for C: 2,3,4,5
 For R: 1,3,4,5
 For A: 1,2,4,5

 We also want to cover new letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

 We can try to form a word that has C, R, A and two new letters.

 Example: ""TRACE"" - but we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E.

 Another: ""CRACK"" - but C is repeated and we don't know if the word has two C's? The feedback for the first word didn't show a duplicate, but it might. However, we have only one C in ""crane"" and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the word has at least one C. But it might have two? We don't know.

 However, we must avoid E and N. Also, we should avoid repeating letters if we are not sure? But we can try to use a word with repeated letters to test? But for now, let's try to use distinct letters to maximize information.

 But we already have three letters (C, R, A) and we need two more. We can try two new letters.

 Let me think of words that have C, R, A and two other letters (not E, N).

 Possibilities: 
 - ""CARDS"": C at position 1? But we know C cannot be at position 1 because in the first guess C was at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put C at position 1 again, it would be wrong again. We want to try C in a new position.

 So we should avoid putting C at position 1, R at position 2, and A at position 3.

 How about ""SCRAP""? 
 S is a new letter, C is at position 2, R at position 3, A at position 4, P is new.
 But note: in ""crane"", C was at 1 and now we put C at 2? That's allowed because we are trying a new position.

 However, we must check the positions we are avoiding for R and A:
 - R: in ""SCRAP"", R is at position 3. We don't know if that is allowed? We only know that in the first guess R was at position 2 and that was wrong. But position 3 might be correct? So we can try.
 - A: in ""SCRAP"", A is at position 4. In the first guess A was at position 3 and that was wrong, so position 4 is new.

 But wait: the word ""SCRAP"" has 5 letters: S, C, R, A, P.

 However, we have to make sure that we are not using E or N. S, C, R, A, P are all allowed.

 But note: the feedback for the first word told us that the secret word has C, R, A. So we are including them.

 However, we are also including S and P, which are new.

 But there's a problem: the word ""SCRAP"" has C at position 2. We don't know if that is the correct position, but we are trying to test.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRWTH"" but that's not common and has W and H which we haven't tested? And it's obscure.

 Another common word: ""TRACK"" - T is new, R at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2 because in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So we cannot put R at position 2 again.

 So in ""TRACK"": 
 T at 1, R at 2 (which is disallowed because we know R is not in position 2), A at 3 (but we know A is not in position 3), C at 4, K at 5.

 We cannot use R at 2 or A at 3. So that word is not good.

 How about ""PARTY""? 
 P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.
 But note: we are including A and R. However, we are missing the letter C? We must include C because we know it's in the word.

 We have to include C, R, A. So the word must have C.

 How about ""CRAMP""? 
 C at 1 (disallowed because we know C is not at position 1), R at 2 (disallowed for R), A at 3 (disallowed for A). So that's bad.

 How about ""SCARF""? 
 S at 1, C at 2 (new position for C), A at 3 (but we cannot put A at 3 because in the first guess A was at 3 and it was wrong) -> so we avoid A at 3.

 How about ""SHARK""? 
 S at 1, H at 2, A at 3 (disallowed for A), R at 4, K at 5. But A is at 3 which is disallowed.

 We need to avoid putting A at position 3.

 How about ""ROACH""? 
 R at 1 (allowed because previously R was at 2, not 1), O at 2, A at 3 (disallowed) -> no.

 How about ""RACES""? 
 But E is not allowed and we have E? So we cannot use E.

 How about ""BARCH""? Not a word.

 Another idea: ""CARTY""? Not a word.

 Let me try to put A in a new position, say position 1? But we don't have any restriction on A at position 1? Only that it cannot be at position 3.

 How about ""ARC?Y"" - but we need a 5-letter word.

 ""ARCHY"" is not common.

 How about ""CRASH""? 
 C at 1 (disallowed) -> no.

 How about ""SCRAM""? 
 S at 1, C at 2 (allowed), R at 3 (allowed, because previously R was at 2, so 3 is new), A at 4 (allowed, because previously A was at 3, so 4 is new), M at 5.

 This seems good: 
 - C is at 2 (new position, not 1)
 - R is at 3 (new position, not 2)
 - A is at 4 (new position, not 3)

 And we are testing S and M.

 So the word is ""SCRAM"".

 But note: we are using M. We don't know if M is in the word? But that's okay because we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SCRAP"" as I thought earlier, but in ""SCRAP"": 
 S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, A at 4, P at 5 -> same as above but with P instead of M.

 Both are valid. Let's choose one.

 I'll go with ""SCRAP"" because P is a common letter.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had C at 1, R at 2, A at 3. Now in ""SCRAP"", we have:
 S (new) at 1, C at 2, R at 3, A at 4, P (new) at 5.

 This way, we are testing C at 2, R at 3, A at 4, which are all new positions.

 So let's guess ""SCRAP"".

 However, note that the feedback for the first word told us that the secret word has C, R, A. So we are including them, and we are also testing two new letters (S and P).

 This is a good guess.

 Therefore, second guess: ""scrap""

 But note: the word must be uppercase? The example was in uppercase. But the problem doesn't specify. However, the feedback was given in uppercase. So let's use uppercase.

 Alternatively, the problem says ""5-letter English word"", so case might not matter, but to be consistent, we'll use uppercase.

 So: <guess>SCRAP</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively.
- N and E are not in the secret word.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes C, R, and A (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoids N and E (since they are absent).
- Places C, R, and A in new positions (C not in position 1, R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
- Tests new letters to gather more information.

The word ""SCRAP"" fits these criteria:
- Contains C (position 2), R (position 3), and A (position 4)—all in new positions.
- Introduces two new letters: S (position 1) and P (position 5).
- Avoids N and E.

This guess will help clarify the positions of C, R, and A while testing S and P.

 We can try a word that rearranges C, R, A and adds two new letters to test.

 Since we don't know the other two letters, we can choose common consonants.

 Let's consider: 
 - We have to avoid positions: C not at 1, R not at 2, A not at 3.

 Possible positions for C: 2,3,4,5
 For R: 1,3,4,5
 For A: 1,2,4,5

 We also want to cover new letters to get more information.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, etc.

 We can try to form a word that has C, R, A and two new letters.

 Example: ""TRACE"" - but we know E is not in the word, so we cannot use E.

 Another: ""CRACK"" - but C is repeated and we don't know if the word has two C's? The feedback for the first word didn't show a duplicate, but it might. However, we have only one C in ""crane"" and it was marked as present but wrong position. So the word has at least one C. But it might have two? We don't know.

 However, we must avoid E and N. Also, we should avoid repeating letters if we are not sure? But we can try to use a word with repeated letters to test? But for now, let's try to use distinct letters to maximize information.

 But we already have three letters (C, R, A) and we need two more. We can try two new letters.

 Let me think of words that have C, R, A and two other letters (not E, N).

 Possibilities: 
 - ""CARDS"": C at position 1? But we know C cannot be at position 1 because in the first guess C was at position 1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So if we put C at position 1 again, it would be wrong again. We want to try C in a new position.

 So we should avoid putting C at position 1, R at position 2, and A at position 3.

 How about ""SCRAP""? 
 S is a new letter, C is at position 2, R at position 3, A at position 4, P is new.
 But note: in ""crane"", C was at 1 and now we put C at 2? That's allowed because we are trying a new position.

 However, we must check the positions we are avoiding for R and A:
 - R: in ""SCRAP"", R is at position 3. We don't know if that is allowed? We only know that in the first guess R was at position 2 and that was wrong. But position 3 might be correct? So we can try.
 - A: in ""SCRAP"", A is at position 4. In the first guess A was at position 3 and that was wrong, so position 4 is new.

 But wait: the word ""SCRAP"" has 5 letters: S, C, R, A, P.

 However, we have to make sure that we are not using E or N. S, C, R, A, P are all allowed.

 But note: the feedback for the first word told us that the secret word has C, R, A. So we are including them.

 However, we are also including S and P, which are new.

 But there's a problem: the word ""SCRAP"" has C at position 2. We don't know if that is the correct position, but we are trying to test.

 Alternatively, we can try ""CRWTH"" but that's not common and has W and H which we haven't tested? And it's obscure.

 Another common word: ""TRACK"" - T is new, R at position 2? But we know R cannot be at position 2 because in the first guess R was at position 2 and it was wrong. So we cannot put R at position 2 again.

 So in ""TRACK"": 
 T at 1, R at 2 (which is disallowed because we know R is not in position 2), A at 3 (but we know A is not in position 3), C at 4, K at 5.

 We cannot use R at 2 or A at 3. So that word is not good.

 How about ""PARTY""? 
 P at 1, A at 2, R at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.
 But note: we are including A and R. However, we are missing the letter C? We must include C because we know it's in the word.

 We have to include C, R, A. So the word must have C.

 How about ""CRAMP""? 
 C at 1 (disallowed because we know C is not at position 1), R at 2 (disallowed for R), A at 3 (disallowed for A). So that's bad.

 How about ""SCARF""? 
 S at 1, C at 2 (new position for C), A at 3 (but we cannot put A at 3 because in the first guess A was at 3 and it was wrong) -> so we avoid A at 3.

 How about ""SHARK""? 
 S at 1, H at 2, A at 3 (disallowed for A), R at 4, K at 5. But A is at 3 which is disallowed.

 We need to avoid putting A at position 3.

 How about ""ROACH""? 
 R at 1 (allowed because previously R was at 2, not 1), O at 2, A at 3 (disallowed) -> no.

 How about ""RACES""? 
 But E is not allowed and we have E? So we cannot use E.

 How about ""BARCH""? Not a word.

 Another idea: ""CARTY""? Not a word.

 Let me try to put A in a new position, say position 1? But we don't have any restriction on A at position 1? Only that it cannot be at position 3.

 How about ""ARC?Y"" - but we need a 5-letter word.

 ""ARCHY"" is not common.

 How about ""CRASH""? 
 C at 1 (disallowed) -> no.

 How about ""SCRAM""? 
 S at 1, C at 2 (allowed), R at 3 (allowed, because previously R was at 2, so 3 is new), A at 4 (allowed, because previously A was at 3, so 4 is new), M at 5.

 This seems good: 
 - C is at 2 (new position, not 1)
 - R is at 3 (new position, not 2)
 - A is at 4 (new position, not 3)

 And we are testing S and M.

 So the word is ""SCRAM"".

 But note: we are using M. We don't know if M is in the word? But that's okay because we are testing.

 Alternatively, we can use ""SCRAP"" as I thought earlier, but in ""SCRAP"": 
 S at 1, C at 2, R at 3, A at 4, P at 5 -> same as above but with P instead of M.

 Both are valid. Let's choose one.

 I'll go with ""SCRAP"" because P is a common letter.

 But wait: in the first guess, we had C at 1, R at 2, A at 3. Now in ""SCRAP"", we have:
 S (new) at 1, C at 2, R at 3, A at 4, P (new) at 5.

 This way, we are testing C at 2, R at 3, A at 4, which are all new positions.

 So let's guess ""SCRAP"".

 However, note that the feedback for the first word told us that the secret word has C, R, A. So we are including them, and we are also testing two new letters (S and P).

 This is a good guess.

 Therefore, second guess: ""scrap""

 But note: the word must be uppercase? The example was in uppercase. But the problem doesn't specify. However, the feedback was given in uppercase. So let's use uppercase.

 Alternatively, the problem says ""5-letter English word"", so case might not matter, but to be consistent, we'll use uppercase.

 So: <guess>SCRAP</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and A are in the secret word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 respectively.
- N and E are not in the secret word.

For the second guess, I need a word that:
- Includes C, R, and A (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoids N and E (since they are absent).
- Places C, R, and A in new positions (C not in position 1, R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
- Tests new letters to gather more information.

The word ""SCRAP"" fits these criteria:
- Contains C (position 2), R (position 3), and A (position 4)—all in new positions.
- Introduces two new letters: S (position 1) and P (position 5).
- Avoids N and E.

This guess will help clarify the positions of C, R, and A while testing S and P.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: - (present, wrong position)
- R: - (present, wrong position)
- A: - (present, wrong position)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Guess 2: SCRAP
- S: ✓ (correct position)
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: ✓ (correct position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- P: x (absent)

From Guess 2, we know that the first four letters of the secret word are S, C, R, A in that order. So the word is ""SCRA?"" and the last letter is unknown.

We also know from Guess 1 that:
- The secret word contains C, R, A, but in the first guess they were in positions 1, 2, and 3, which were wrong. Now in the second guess, they are in positions 2, 3, and 4 and are correct. This is consistent because the positions are different.

Additionally, we know that the secret word does not contain N, E, or P.

Therefore, the secret word is ""SCRA"" followed by one letter that is not N, E, or P.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SCRA"" and the fifth letter is not N, E, or P.

Possible words: 
- SCRAB? (not a word)
- SCRAD? (not a word)
- SCRAF? (not a word)
- SCRAG? -> SCRAG is a word (meaning: to gather or collect)
- SCRAWL? -> but that's 6 letters
- SCRAM? -> we already used SCRAM? But in the previous guess we had SCRAP, not SCRAM. SCRAM is 5 letters and means to leave quickly.

But note: in the second guess, we had SCRAP and P was absent, so the last letter cannot be P.

Let me list common words starting with ""SCRA"":
- SCRAB? -> no
- SCRAD? -> no
- SCRAE? -> not common
- SCRAG: yes, meaning a thin or scrawny person or animal; also a verb meaning to gather.
- SCRAM: a verb meaning to leave quickly. This is a common word.
- SCRAN: but N is absent (from first guess), so no.
- SCRAP: we tried and P is absent, so no.
- SCRAT? -> not a word.
- SCRAW? -> not common.

So the only common words are SCRAG and SCRAM.

But we must confirm: is there any other?
- SCRAY? -> not a word.

So the secret word must be either ""SCRAG"" or ""SCRAM"".

We have one more thing: from the first guess, we had the letter A in position 3 (in CRANE) and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now in the secret word, if it is ""SCRAM"", then A is in position 4. That is a different position, so it's consistent.

Similarly, for ""SCRAG"", A is in position 4.

But we need to check the first guess: in CRANE, C was in position 1, but in the secret word (if it's SCRAM or SCRAG) C is in position 2. That's a different position, so it's consistent.

R was in position 2 in CRANE, but in the secret word it's in position 3, so also consistent.

Now, we have two candidates: SCRAG and SCRAM.

We need to guess one of them. We have 6 tries, so we can guess one and if it's wrong, the next will be the other.

But note: we are on the third guess. We can try to guess one.

Alternatively, we can think if there is any other word? What about ""SCRAWL""? But that's 6 letters, not 5.

Or ""SCRAPE""? 6 letters.

So only two possibilities.

We can try ""SCRAM"" because it's more common.

But let me check the feedback again: in the first guess, we had E and N absent. In the second, P absent. So the last letter must be a letter that is not E, N, P.

For SCRAM: last letter M. M is not E, N, P -> allowed.
For SCRAG: last letter G. G is not E, N, P -> allowed.

So both are possible.

We can guess ""SCRAM"" and if it's wrong, then it must be ""SCRAG"".

But note: we have to make a guess. Let's choose ""SCRAM"".

So the third guess is ""SCRAM"".

But wait: what if the word is ""SCRAWL""? No, it's 6 letters. Similarly, ""SCRAPE"" is 6. So no.

Another word: ""SCRABS""? 6 letters.

So I think only two options.

Therefore, we guess ""SCRAM"".

But note: in the second guess, we had ""SCRAP"" and P was absent. So if we guess ""SCRAM"", we are replacing P with M.

If the secret word is ""SCRAM"", then we win. If not, then it must be ""SCRAG"".

So let's do that.

<guess>SCRAM</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, and A are present but in the wrong positions (C not in position 1, R not in position 2, A not in position 3), while N and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (SCRAP)**: S, C, R, and A are in the correct positions (positions 1–4), and P is absent.

### Analysis:
- The secret word starts with ""SCRA"" (positions 1–4 are confirmed as S, C, R, A).
- The 5th letter is unknown but must not be N, E, or P (since these are absent from previous feedback).
- Common 5-letter words starting with ""SCRA"" include ""SCRAM"" (meaning to leave quickly) and ""SCRAG"" (meaning something thin or scrawny). Both fit the constraints:
  - ""SCRAM"" ends with M (not N, E, or P).
  - ""SCRAG"" ends with G (not N, E, or P).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- With only two likely candidates (""SCRAM"" and ""SCRAG""), I'll prioritize ""SCRAM"" as it is more commonly used. If this guess is incorrect, ""SCRAG"" will be the next logical guess.
- This approach efficiently narrows down the possibilities with minimal guesses.

<guess>SCRAM</guess>",SCRAM,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: - (present, wrong position)
- R: - (present, wrong position)
- A: - (present, wrong position)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Guess 2: SCRAP
- S: ✓ (correct position)
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: ✓ (correct position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- P: x (absent)

From Guess 2, we know that the first four letters of the secret word are S, C, R, A in that order. So the word is ""SCRA?"" and the last letter is unknown.

We also know from Guess 1 that:
- The secret word contains C, R, A, but in the first guess they were in positions 1, 2, and 3, which were wrong. Now in the second guess, they are in positions 2, 3, and 4 and are correct. This is consistent because the positions are different.

Additionally, we know that the secret word does not contain N, E, or P.

Therefore, the secret word is ""SCRA"" followed by one letter that is not N, E, or P.

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""SCRA"" and the fifth letter is not N, E, or P.

Possible words: 
- SCRAB? (not a word)
- SCRAD? (not a word)
- SCRAF? (not a word)
- SCRAG? -> SCRAG is a word (meaning: to gather or collect)
- SCRAWL? -> but that's 6 letters
- SCRAM? -> we already used SCRAM? But in the previous guess we had SCRAP, not SCRAM. SCRAM is 5 letters and means to leave quickly.

But note: in the second guess, we had SCRAP and P was absent, so the last letter cannot be P.

Let me list common words starting with ""SCRA"":
- SCRAB? -> no
- SCRAD? -> no
- SCRAE? -> not common
- SCRAG: yes, meaning a thin or scrawny person or animal; also a verb meaning to gather.
- SCRAM: a verb meaning to leave quickly. This is a common word.
- SCRAN: but N is absent (from first guess), so no.
- SCRAP: we tried and P is absent, so no.
- SCRAT? -> not a word.
- SCRAW? -> not common.

So the only common words are SCRAG and SCRAM.

But we must confirm: is there any other?
- SCRAY? -> not a word.

So the secret word must be either ""SCRAG"" or ""SCRAM"".

We have one more thing: from the first guess, we had the letter A in position 3 (in CRANE) and it was marked as present but wrong position. Now in the secret word, if it is ""SCRAM"", then A is in position 4. That is a different position, so it's consistent.

Similarly, for ""SCRAG"", A is in position 4.

But we need to check the first guess: in CRANE, C was in position 1, but in the secret word (if it's SCRAM or SCRAG) C is in position 2. That's a different position, so it's consistent.

R was in position 2 in CRANE, but in the secret word it's in position 3, so also consistent.

Now, we have two candidates: SCRAG and SCRAM.

We need to guess one of them. We have 6 tries, so we can guess one and if it's wrong, the next will be the other.

But note: we are on the third guess. We can try to guess one.

Alternatively, we can think if there is any other word? What about ""SCRAWL""? But that's 6 letters, not 5.

Or ""SCRAPE""? 6 letters.

So only two possibilities.

We can try ""SCRAM"" because it's more common.

But let me check the feedback again: in the first guess, we had E and N absent. In the second, P absent. So the last letter must be a letter that is not E, N, P.

For SCRAM: last letter M. M is not E, N, P -> allowed.
For SCRAG: last letter G. G is not E, N, P -> allowed.

So both are possible.

We can guess ""SCRAM"" and if it's wrong, then it must be ""SCRAG"".

But note: we have to make a guess. Let's choose ""SCRAM"".

So the third guess is ""SCRAM"".

But wait: what if the word is ""SCRAWL""? No, it's 6 letters. Similarly, ""SCRAPE"" is 6. So no.

Another word: ""SCRABS""? 6 letters.

So I think only two options.

Therefore, we guess ""SCRAM"".

But note: in the second guess, we had ""SCRAP"" and P was absent. So if we guess ""SCRAM"", we are replacing P with M.

If the secret word is ""SCRAM"", then we win. If not, then it must be ""SCRAG"".

So let's do that.

<guess>SCRAM</guess>Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C, R, and A are present but in the wrong positions (C not in position 1, R not in position 2, A not in position 3), while N and E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (SCRAP)**: S, C, R, and A are in the correct positions (positions 1–4), and P is absent.

### Analysis:
- The secret word starts with ""SCRA"" (positions 1–4 are confirmed as S, C, R, A).
- The 5th letter is unknown but must not be N, E, or P (since these are absent from previous feedback).
- Common 5-letter words starting with ""SCRA"" include ""SCRAM"" (meaning to leave quickly) and ""SCRAG"" (meaning something thin or scrawny). Both fit the constraints:
  - ""SCRAM"" ends with M (not N, E, or P).
  - ""SCRAG"" ends with G (not N, E, or P).

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- With only two likely candidates (""SCRAM"" and ""SCRAG""), I'll prioritize ""SCRAM"" as it is more commonly used. If this guess is incorrect, ""SCRAG"" will be the next logical guess.
- This approach efficiently narrows down the possibilities with minimal guesses.",Guess 3: SCRAM -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(✓) R(✓) A(✓) M(✓),SUCCESS
