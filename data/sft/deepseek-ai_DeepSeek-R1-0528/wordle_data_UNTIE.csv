First, I'm starting with no information about the secret word since it's the first guess. I need to choose a word that maximizes the information I get from the feedback. That means I should pick a word with common letters and a good spread of vowels and consonants.

Common letters in English 5-letter words: I recall that vowels like A, E, I, O, U are important, and common consonants include S, T, R, N, L, etc.

A good starting word for Wordle or similar games is often ""AROSE"" or ""CRANE"" because they have multiple vowels and common consonants. Let me think about the letters:

- ""AROSE"" has A, R, O, S, E – that's three vowels (A, O, E) and two consonants (R, S).

- ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E – two vowels (A, E) and three consonants (C, R, N).

Another popular one is ""SLATE"" or ""IRATE"".

To cover more vowels, I should include more than one vowel. English words usually have vowels, so maximizing vowels in the first guess can help identify them quickly.

But the secret word might not have rare letters, so I should avoid words with uncommon letters like Q, Z, X, etc.

I'll go with ""CRANE"". Let me confirm: C-R-A-N-E. That seems fine.

""C"" might be less common, but in ""CRANE"", it's paired with common letters.

""AROSE"" might be better for vowels.

I think ""RAISE"" is also good: R-A-I-S-E – that has three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S).

""RAISE"" covers A, I, E which are vowels, and R, S which are common consonants.

Similarly, ""SOARE"" but that might not be as common; ""ARISE"" is another option.

I should choose a word that is common to ensure it's valid.

Let me decide on ""RAISE"". It has R, A, I, S, E – good coverage.

After this guess, the feedback will tell me which letters are correct, which are in the word but wrong position, or missing.

The response format requires me to think step by step and then output the guess in <guess> tags.

So for the first guess, I'll go with ""RAISE"".

Final decision: Guess ""RAISE"".
</think>
For my first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain, especially given that I have no prior information about the secret word. A strong starting word typically includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to cover as many possibilities as possible. Common choices in word games like Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"", as they contain frequent letters in English.

I choose ""RAISE"" because:
- It has three vowels (A, I, E), which are highly likely to appear in the secret word, helping to identify vowel presence quickly.
- It includes common consonants (R, S), improving the chances of hitting correct or misplaced consonants.
- No rare letters (like X or Z) are included, avoiding wasted guesses on less common options.

After this guess, the feedback will provide insights on the position and presence of each letter, which will inform my next guess.

We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"": 
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓)

So, we know:
- The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 3 (since we got a '-' for that position). It must be in one of the first four positions (positions 1,2,3,4) but not 3.
- The letters R, A, and S are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have E at the end (position 5).
- Must contain the letter I, but not at position 3.
- Does not contain R, A, or S.

We need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

Strategy for the next guess:
1. We must include the letter I (since it's in the word) and try it in a different position (not position 3). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.
2. We must include E at position 5 (since it's correct and we can confirm it stays).
3. Avoid using R, A, S (since they are absent).
4. Use other common letters to test for presence (e.g., T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.).

Given that I must be in the word and not at position 3, and E is fixed at position 5, let's think of words that fit:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E, and the word must contain I (somewhere in positions 1,2,4).

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Good candidate words:
- Try to put I in position 1: e.g., ""IMAGE"" (but note: A is not allowed, so avoid A).
- Avoid A, R, S.

Alternative: put I in position 2: e.g., ""TIGER"" (but R is not allowed) -> invalid.
- Put I in position 4: e.g., ""OPINE"" (O, P, I, N, E). This seems promising.

Check ""OPINE"":
- O: not yet tested (new)
- P: not yet tested
- I: we know it's in the word, but we are trying it at position 4 (which might be correct or not)
- N: not yet tested
- E: fixed at position 5 (correct)

But note: we have to avoid A, R, S. ""OPINE"" doesn't contain these, so it's okay.

Another option: ""QUITE"" (Q is less common, might not be ideal) or ""UNITE"" (U, N, I, T, E). ""UNITE"" has:
- U: new
- N: new
- I: at position 3? But wait, in ""UNITE"", I is at position 3. However, in our feedback, I was at position 3 in ""RAISE"" and it was marked as wrong position. That means I cannot be at position 3 in the secret word. So if we put I at position 3 again, we already know it's wrong. We should try I in a new position.

Therefore, avoid putting I at position 3. In ""UNITE"", I is at position 3, so that would be a wasted opportunity to test I in a new position.

Better: put I at position 1 or 2 or 4.

Let me try position 1: e.g., ""ICILY"" (but has I twice, and we don't know about duplicates? The feedback didn't indicate duplicate, but we don't know if the word has duplicate I. However, we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information). Also, ""ICILY"" has C, L, Y.

But let's think of words with I at position 1 and E at 5: e.g., ""INANE"" (but has A, which is not allowed) -> invalid.

Another: ""ILLEGAL"" is 7 letters, too long.

5-letter words: ""IMPEL"" (I, M, P, E, L) -> but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. So ""IMPEL"" has E at 4, not 5.

We need E at the end. So words ending with E.

How about ""OILIE""? Not a common word.

Better: ""OLIVE"" -> but V is new, and O, L, I, V, E. But I is at position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for I. In ""OLIVE"", I is at position 3 -> not good.

Put I at position 2: e.g., ""TITLE"" (T, I, T, L, E). But T appears twice? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have E at the end. But note: T is new, and we can test it. However, the double T might be an issue? But let's see: if the word has only one T, then we might get confusing feedback. Better to avoid duplicates for now.

Another: ""PIECE"" (P, I, E, C, E) -> duplicate E? And E is at position 3 and 5? We know E is at 5, but we don't know if there is another E. Also, I is at position 2. But ""PIECE"" has two E's, which might be acceptable, but we are testing I at position 2.

But we also have to avoid A, R, S. ""PIECE"" doesn't have them.

However, we already know E is at position 5, so if we put E at position 3, we might get feedback on whether there is another E? But that might be too early. We are only on the second guess.

Alternatively, put I at position 4: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but I is at position 3? No, ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E, so I is at position 3. We want to avoid position 3.

Position 4: e.g., ""OXIDE"" (O, X, I, D, E). X is not very common, but it's a valid word.

Another: ""OUNCE"" (O, U, N, C, E) -> but no I? We must include I because we know it's in the word. So we have to include I.

So for position 4: ""NOISE"" -> but S is not allowed (we know S is absent). So invalid.

""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> S is absent, so invalid.

""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> I is at position 3? ""QUITE"" is Q-U-I-T-E, so I at 3 -> avoid.

""URINE"" -> U, R, I, N, E -> R is absent, invalid.

""ALIEN"" -> A is absent, invalid.

""BEGIN"" -> B, E, G, I, N -> but E is at position 2? We need E at 5. So no.

We need a word with I in position 1,2, or 4 and E at 5, and no R, A, S.

Let me list possible words:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
  - e.g., ""INLET"" (I, N, L, E, T) -> but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T -> no E at 5.
  - ""IDLER"" -> R is absent, invalid.
  - ""IGLOO"" -> no E at the end.

Actually, we need the fifth letter to be E. So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E

And I must be in one of the first four positions, but not position 3 (because in the first guess, I was at 3 and was wrong position). So I can be at 1, 2, or 4.

Let me think of words ending with E that have I at position 1, 2, or 4 and no R, A, S.

- I at 1: ""IMAGE"" -> A invalid.
  ""INODE"" (not common) 
  ""ICICLE"" too long.
  ""ITCHY"" no E.

How about ""IMPLE"" not a word.

Common word: ""INVITE"" -> 6 letters.

5-letter: ""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D -> but E is at position 4? ""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D -> E at 4, not 5.

We need E at 5. So the word must end with E.

Examples: 
- I at 1: ""IXORA"" not ending with E.
  ""INURE"" -> U, R -> R invalid.

I at 2: e.g., ""TIGER"" -> R invalid.
  ""TIMED"" -> M, E, D -> E at 4? ""TIMED"" is T-I-M-E-D -> E at 4, not 5.

I at 4: e.g., ""MOVIE"" -> M, O, V, I, E -> I at 4, E at 5. And no R, A, S. This seems good.

""MOVIE"" is a valid word. Let's use that.

But we also want to test other common letters. ""MOVIE"" has M, O, V, I, E. V is less common, but it's acceptable.

Another option: ""NOBLE"" -> N, O, B, L, E -> but no I? We must include I because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip I.

We have to include I to get more information about its position.

So ""MOVIE"" is a candidate.

Another: ""TOWIE"" not common.

""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E -> I at position 2, E at 5. And no R, A, S. This is also good.

""BIOME"" vs ""MOVIE"": both are valid.

""BIOME"" has B and M, which are common, and O.

""MOVIE"" has M, O, V.

B is more common than V, so ""BIOME"" might be better.

But let's see the positions: in ""BIOME"", I is at position 2. We haven't tried position 2 yet, so it's a good test.

In ""MOVIE"", I is at position 4, which we also haven't tried.

Both are acceptable. I'll go with ""BIOME"" because it has more common letters.

But note: we also have the letter E fixed at 5, so we can keep that.

Another candidate: ""CHIME"" -> C, H, I, M, E -> I at 3? ""CHIME"" is C-H-I-M-E -> I at position 3. We know I is not at position 3, so we should avoid putting I at 3 again. So ""CHIME"" is not good.

Similarly, ""GLIDE"" -> G, L, I, D, E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

So back to ""BIOME"" or ""MOVIE"".

I think ""BIOME"" is a better choice because B is more common than V.

But let's consider: we know the word has I and E (with E at 5), and no R, A, S.

After ""RAISE"" feedback, we have:

- E is correct at 5.
- I is present but not at 3.
- R, A, S absent.

So for the next guess, we can also try to cover more new letters.

""BIOME"" uses B, I, O, M, E. We already know E is in and at 5, and I is in (so we are testing its position). The new letters are B, O, M.

""MOVIE"" uses M, O, V, I, E -> new letters M, O, V.

Both are similar, but V is less common than B, so ""BIOME"" might be better.

Another word: ""OZONE"" -> no I, invalid.

""QUINE"" -> Q, U, I, N, E -> I at 3? ""QUINE"" is Q-U-I-N-E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

""UNLIT"" -> no E.

I think ""BIOME"" is a solid choice.

But let me confirm: is ""BIOME"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it means a biological community.

So I'll go with ""BIOME"".

Alternatively, ""THINE"" -> T, H, I, N, E -> I at 3? ""THINE"" is T-H-I-N-E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

""WHILE"" -> W, H, I, L, E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

""GUILD"" -> no E.

So ""BIOME"" seems good.

Another option: ""DEICE"" -> D, E, I, C, E -> duplicate E? And E at position 2 and 5? We know E is at 5, but we don't know if there is another E. Also, I is at position 3 -> avoid.

""NOISE"" -> S invalid.

I think ""BIOME"" is the best.

But let's try to put I at position 1: ""ITCHY"" no E.

""INNER"" -> R invalid.

""IDIOM"" -> no E.

So I'll go with ""BIOME"".

Final decision: Guess ""BIOME"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""RAISE"" → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)), we know:
- **E** is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
- **I** is in the word but not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4).
- **R, A, S** are not in the word.

For Guess 2, I need to:
- Keep **E** at position 5 (since it's confirmed correct).
- Include **I** in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.
- Avoid **R, A, S** entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, M, N, T) to gather more information.

I chose **""BIOME""** because:
- It places **I** at position 2 (a new position to test, since position 3 is ruled out).
- It keeps **E** at position 5.
- It avoids R, A, S.
- It introduces three new common letters: **B** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **M** (position 4), which are high-frequency and can reveal more about the secret word.
- It's a valid 5-letter word (meaning a biological community).

This guess will help narrow down the position of **I** and check for the presence of B, O, and M.

""BIOME"" uses B, I, O, M, E. We already know E is in and at 5, and I is in (so we are testing its position). The new letters are B, O, M.

""MOVIE"" uses M, O, V, I, E -> new letters M, O, V.

Both are similar, but V is less common than B, so ""BIOME"" might be better.

Another word: ""OZONE"" -> no I, invalid.

""QUINE"" -> Q, U, I, N, E -> I at 3? ""QUINE"" is Q-U-I-N-E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

""UNLIT"" -> no E.

I think ""BIOME"" is a solid choice.

But let me confirm: is ""BIOME"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it means a biological community.

So I'll go with ""BIOME"".

Alternatively, ""THINE"" -> T, H, I, N, E -> I at 3? ""THINE"" is T-H-I-N-E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

""WHILE"" -> W, H, I, L, E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

""GUILD"" -> no E.

So ""BIOME"" seems good.

Another option: ""DEICE"" -> D, E, I, C, E -> duplicate E? And E at position 2 and 5? We know E is at 5, but we don't know if there is another E. Also, I is at position 3 -> avoid.

""NOISE"" -> S invalid.

I think ""BIOME"" is the best.

But let's try to put I at position 1: ""ITCHY"" no E.

""INNER"" -> R invalid.

""IDIOM"" -> no E.

So I'll go with ""BIOME"".

Final decision: Guess ""BIOME"".Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""RAISE"" → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)), we know:
- **E** is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
- **I** is in the word but not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4).
- **R, A, S** are not in the word.

For Guess 2, I need to:
- Keep **E** at position 5 (since it's confirmed correct).
- Include **I** in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.
- Avoid **R, A, S** entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, M, N, T) to gather more information.

I chose **""BIOME""** because:
- It places **I** at position 2 (a new position to test, since position 3 is ruled out).
- It keeps **E** at position 5.
- It avoids R, A, S.
- It introduces three new common letters: **B** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **M** (position 4), which are high-frequency and can reveal more about the secret word.
- It's a valid 5-letter word (meaning a biological community).

This guess will help narrow down the position of **I** and check for the presence of B, O, and M.",Guess 3: biome -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(-) O(x) M(x) E(✓),FAIL

For my first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain, especially given that I have no prior information about the secret word. A strong starting word typically includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to cover as many possibilities as possible. Common choices in word games like Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"", as they contain frequent letters in English.

I choose ""RAISE"" because:
- It has three vowels (A, I, E), which are highly likely to appear in the secret word, helping to identify vowel presence quickly.
- It includes common consonants (R, S), improving the chances of hitting correct or misplaced consonants.
- No rare letters (like X or Z) are included, avoiding wasted guesses on less common options.

After this guess, the feedback will provide insights on the position and presence of each letter, which will inform my next guess.

<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game, and the user has asked for the first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I need to choose an optimal starting word.
 Common strategies suggest using words with multiple vowels and common consonants to maximize information. Words like ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", etc., are popular.
 I'll select ""RAISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help identify the presence and positions of several letters.
 
 For the response format: I'll think step by step and then output the guess in the required XML tag.

 Thought process:
 - First guess: Aim for high-entropy letters.
 - Word: ""RAISE"" (letters: R, A, I, S, E)
 - If I get feedback, it might show which letters are present and their positions.

 Output: <guess>raise</guess>For the first guess, I selected ""RAISE"" based on common Wordle strategy. It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two high-frequency consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance of getting meaningful feedback about the secret word's composition. This will help identify vowel placements and common consonants quickly. I have no prior information, so this is an optimal starting point.

<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"": 
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓)

So, we know:
- The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 3 (since we got a '-' for that position). It must be in one of the first four positions (positions 1,2,3,4) but not 3.
- The letters R, A, and S are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have E at the end (position 5).
- Must contain the letter I, but not at position 3.
- Does not contain R, A, or S.

We need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

Strategy for the next guess:
1. We must include the letter I (since it's in the word) and try it in a different position (not position 3). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.
2. We must include E at position 5 (since it's correct and we can confirm it stays).
3. Avoid using R, A, S (since they are absent).
4. Use other common letters to test for presence (e.g., T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.).

Given that I must be in the word and not at position 3, and E is fixed at position 5, let's think of words that fit:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E, and the word must contain I (somewhere in positions 1,2,4).

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Good candidate words:
- Try to put I in position 1: e.g., ""IMAGE"" (but note: A is not allowed, so avoid A).
- Avoid A, R, S.

Alternative: put I in position 2: e.g., ""TIGER"" (but R is not allowed) -> invalid.
- Put I in position 4: e.g., ""OPINE"" (O, P, I, N, E). This seems promising.

Check ""OPINE"":
- O: not yet tested (new)
- P: not yet tested
- I: we know it's in the word, but we are trying it at position 4 (which might be correct or not)
- N: not yet tested
- E: fixed at position 5 (correct)

But note: we have to avoid A, R, S. ""OPINE"" doesn't contain these, so it's okay.

Another option: ""QUITE"" (Q is less common, might not be ideal) or ""UNITE"" (U, N, I, T, E). ""UNITE"" has:
- U: new
- N: new
- I: at position 3? But wait, in ""UNITE"", I is at position 3. However, in our feedback, I was at position 3 in ""RAISE"" and it was marked as wrong position. That means I cannot be at position 3 in the secret word. So if we put I at position 3 again, we already know it's wrong. We should try I in a new position.

Therefore, avoid putting I at position 3. In ""UNITE"", I is at position 3, so that would be a wasted opportunity to test I in a new position.

Better: put I at position 1 or 2 or 4.

Let me try position 1: e.g., ""ICILY"" (but has I twice, and we don't know about duplicates? The feedback didn't indicate duplicate, but we don't know if the word has duplicate I. However, we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information). Also, ""ICILY"" has C, L, Y.

But let's think of words with I at position 1 and E at 5: e.g., ""INANE"" (but has A, which is not allowed) -> invalid.

Another: ""ILLEGAL"" is 7 letters, too long.

5-letter words: ""IMPEL"" (I, M, P, E, L) -> but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. So ""IMPEL"" has E at 4, not 5.

We need E at the end. So words ending with E.

How about ""OILIE""? Not a common word.

Better: ""OLIVE"" -> but V is new, and O, L, I, V, E. But I is at position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for I. In ""OLIVE"", I is at position 3 -> not good.

Put I at position 2: e.g., ""TITLE"" (T, I, T, L, E). But T appears twice? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have E at the end. But note: T is new, and we can test it. However, the double T might be an issue? But let's see: if the word has only one T, then we might get confusing feedback. Better to avoid duplicates for now.

Another: ""PIECE"" (P, I, E, C, E) -> duplicate E? And E is at position 3 and 5? We know E is at 5, but we don't know if there is another E. Also, I is at position 2. But ""PIECE"" has two E's, which might be acceptable, but we are testing I at position 2.

But we also have to avoid A, R, S. ""PIECE"" doesn't have them.

However, we already know E is at position 5, so if we put E at position 3, we might get feedback on whether there is another E? But that might be too early. We are only on the second guess.

Alternatively, put I at position 4: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but I is at position 3? No, ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E, so I is at position 3. We want to avoid position 3.

Position 4: e.g., ""OXIDE"" (O, X, I, D, E). X is not very common, but it's a valid word.

Another: ""OUNCE"" (O, U, N, C, E) -> but no I? We must include I because we know it's in the word. So we have to include I.

So for position 4: ""NOISE"" -> but S is not allowed (we know S is absent). So invalid.

""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> S is absent, so invalid.

""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> I is at position 3? ""QUITE"" is Q-U-I-T-E, so I at 3 -> avoid.

""URINE"" -> U, R, I, N, E -> R is absent, invalid.

""ALIEN"" -> A is absent, invalid.

""BEGIN"" -> B, E, G, I, N -> but E is at position 2? We need E at 5. So no.

We need a word with I in position 1,2, or 4 and E at 5, and no R, A, S.

Let me list possible words:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
  - e.g., ""INLET"" (I, N, L, E, T) -> but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T -> no E at 5.
  - ""IDLER"" -> R is absent, invalid.
  - ""IGLOO"" -> no E at the end.

Actually, we need the fifth letter to be E. So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E

And I must be in one of the first four positions, but not position 3 (because in the first guess, I was at 3 and was wrong position). So I can be at 1, 2, or 4.

Let me think of words ending with E that have I at position 1, 2, or 4 and no R, A, S.

- I at 1: ""IMAGE"" -> A invalid.
  ""INODE"" (not common) 
  ""ICICLE"" too long.
  ""ITCHY"" no E.

How about ""IMPLE"" not a word.

Common word: ""INVITE"" -> 6 letters.

5-letter: ""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D -> but E is at position 4? ""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D -> E at 4, not 5.

We need E at 5. So the word must end with E.

Examples: 
- I at 1: ""IXORA"" not ending with E.
  ""INURE"" -> U, R -> R invalid.

I at 2: e.g., ""TIGER"" -> R invalid.
  ""TIMED"" -> M, E, D -> E at 4? ""TIMED"" is T-I-M-E-D -> E at 4, not 5.

I at 4: e.g., ""MOVIE"" -> M, O, V, I, E -> I at 4, E at 5. And no R, A, S. This seems good.

""MOVIE"" is a valid word. Let's use that.

But we also want to test other common letters. ""MOVIE"" has M, O, V, I, E. V is less common, but it's acceptable.

Another option: ""NOBLE"" -> N, O, B, L, E -> but no I? We must include I because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip I.

We have to include I to get more information about its position.

So ""MOVIE"" is a candidate.

Another: ""TOWIE"" not common.

""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E -> I at position 2, E at 5. And no R, A, S. This is also good.

""BIOME"" vs ""MOVIE"": both are valid.

""BIOME"" has B and M, which are common, and O.

""MOVIE"" has M, O, V.

B is more common than V, so ""BIOME"" might be better.

But let's see the positions: in ""BIOME"", I is at position 2. We haven't tried position 2 yet, so it's a good test.

In ""MOVIE"", I is at position 4, which we also haven't tried.

Both are acceptable. I'll go with ""BIOME"" because it has more common letters.

But note: we also have the letter E fixed at 5, so we can keep that.

Another candidate: ""CHIME"" -> C, H, I, M, E -> I at 3? ""CHIME"" is C-H-I-M-E -> I at position 3. We know I is not at position 3, so we should avoid putting I at 3 again. So ""CHIME"" is not good.

Similarly, ""GLIDE"" -> G, L, I, D, E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

So back to ""BIOME"" or ""MOVIE"".

I think ""BIOME"" is a better choice because B is more common than V.

But let's consider: we know the word has I and E (with E at 5), and no R, A, S.

After ""RAISE"" feedback, we have:

- E is correct at 5.
- I is present but not at 3.
- R, A, S absent.

So for the next guess, we can also try to cover more new letters.

""BIOME"" uses B, I, O, M, E. We already know E is in and at 5, and I is in (so we are testing its position). The new letters are B, O, M.

""MOVIE"" uses M, O, V, I, E -> new letters M, O, V.

Both are similar, but V is less common than B, so ""BIOME"" might be better.

Another word: ""OZONE"" -> no I, invalid.

""QUINE"" -> Q, U, I, N, E -> I at 3? ""QUINE"" is Q-U-I-N-E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

""UNLIT"" -> no E.

I think ""BIOME"" is a solid choice.

But let me confirm: is ""BIOME"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it means a biological community.

So I'll go with ""BIOME"".

Alternatively, ""THINE"" -> T, H, I, N, E -> I at 3? ""THINE"" is T-H-I-N-E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

""WHILE"" -> W, H, I, L, E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

""GUILD"" -> no E.

So ""BIOME"" seems good.

Another option: ""DEICE"" -> D, E, I, C, E -> duplicate E? And E at position 2 and 5? We know E is at 5, but we don't know if there is another E. Also, I is at position 3 -> avoid.

""NOISE"" -> S invalid.

I think ""BIOME"" is the best.

But let's try to put I at position 1: ""ITCHY"" no E.

""INNER"" -> R invalid.

""IDIOM"" -> no E.

So I'll go with ""BIOME"".

Final decision: Guess ""BIOME"".Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""RAISE"" → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)), we know:
- **E** is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
- **I** is in the word but not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4).
- **R, A, S** are not in the word.

For Guess 2, I need to:
- Keep **E** at position 5 (since it's confirmed correct).
- Include **I** in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.
- Avoid **R, A, S** entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, M, N, T) to gather more information.

I chose **""BIOME""** because:
- It places **I** at position 2 (a new position to test, since position 3 is ruled out).
- It keeps **E** at position 5.
- It avoids R, A, S.
- It introduces three new common letters: **B** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **M** (position 4), which are high-frequency and can reveal more about the secret word.
- It's a valid 5-letter word (meaning a biological community).

This guess will help narrow down the position of **I** and check for the presence of B, O, and M.

This should help identify the presence and positions of several letters.\n \n For the response format: I\'ll think step by step and then output the guess in the required XML tag.\n\n Thought process:\n - First guess: Aim for high-entropy letters.\n - Word: ""RAISE"" (letters: R, A, I, S, E)\n - If I get feedback, it might show which letters are present and their positions.\n\n Output: <guess>raise</guess>For the first guess, I selected ""RAISE"" based on common Wordle strategy. It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two high-frequency consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance of getting meaningful feedback about the secret word\'s composition. This will help identify vowel placements and common consonants quickly. I have no prior information, so this is an optimal starting point.\n\n<guess>raise</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: tags.\n\nSo for the first guess, I\'ll go with ""RAISE"".\n\nFinal decision: Guess ""RAISE"".\n</think>\nFor my first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain, especially given that I have no prior information about the secret word.

It must be in one of the first four positions (positions 1,2,3,4) but not 3.\n- The letters R, A, and S are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word:\n- Must have E at the end (position 5).\n- Must contain the letter I, but not at position 3.\n- Does not contain R, A, or S.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.\n\nStrategy for the next guess:\n1. We must include the letter I (since it\'s in the word) and try it in a different position (not position 3). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.\n2. We must include E at position 5 (since it\'s correct and we can confirm it stays).\n3. Avoid using R, A, S (since they are absent).\n4. Use other common letters to test for presence (e.g., T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.).\n\nGiven that I must be in the word and not at position 3, and E is fixed at position 5, let\'s think of words that fit:\n- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E, and the word must contain I (somewhere in positions 1,2,4).\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nGood candidate words:\n- Try to put I in position 1: e.g., ""IMAGE"" (but note: A is not allowed, so avoid A).\n- Avoid A, R, S.\n\nAlternative: put I in position 2: e.g., ""TIGER"" (but R is not allowed) -> invalid.\n- Put I in position 4: e.g., ""OPINE"" (O, P, I, N, E). This seems promising.\n\nCheck ""OPINE"":\n- O: not yet tested (new)\n- P: not yet tested\n- I: we know it\'s in the word, but we are trying it at position 4 (which might be correct or not)\n- N: not yet tested\n- E: fixed at position 5 (correct)\n\nBut note: we have to avoid A, R, S. ""OPINE"" doesn\'t contain these, so it\'s okay.\n\nAnother option: ""QUITE"" (Q is less common, might not be ideal) or ""UNITE"" (U, N, I, T, E). ""UNITE"" has:\n- U: new\n- N: new\n- I: at position 3? But wait, in ""UNITE"", I is at position 3. However, in our feedback, I was at position 3 in ""RAISE"" and it was marked as wrong position. That means I cannot be at position 3 in the secret word. So if we put I at position 3 again, we already know it\'s wrong. We should try I in a new position.\n\nTherefore, avoid putting I at position 3. In ""UNITE"", I is at position 3, so that would be a wasted opportunity to test I in a new position.\n\nBetter: put I at position 1 or 2 or 4.\n\nLet me try position 1: e.g., ""ICILY"" (but has I twice, and we don\'t know about duplicates? The feedback didn\'t indicate duplicate, but we don\'t know if the word has duplicate I. However, we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information). Also, ""ICILY"" has C, L, Y.\n\nBut let\'s think of words with I at position 1 and E at 5: e.g., ""INANE"" (but has A, which is not allowed) -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""ILLEGAL"" is 7 letters, too long.\n\n5-letter words: ""IMPEL"" (I, M, P, E, L) -> but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. So ""IMPEL"" has E at 4, not 5.\n\nWe need E at the end. So words ending with E.\n\nHow about ""OILIE""? Not a common word.\n\nBetter: ""OLIVE"" -> but V is new, and O, L, I, V, E. But I is at position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for I. In ""OLIVE"", I is at position 3 -> not good.\n\nPut I at position 2: e.g., ""TITLE"" (T, I, T, L, E). But T appears twice? And we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we have E at the end. But note: T is new, and we can test it. However, the double T might be an issue? But let\'s see: if the word has only one T, then we might get confusing feedback. Better to avoid duplicates for now.\n\nAnother: ""PIECE"" (P, I, E, C, E) -> duplicate E? And E is at position 3 and 5? We know E is at 5, but we don\'t know if there is another E. Also, I is at position 2. But ""PIECE"" has two E\'s, which might be acceptable, but we are testing I at position 2.\n\nBut we also have to avoid A, R, S. ""PIECE"" doesn\'t have them.\n\nHowever, we already know E is at position 5, so if we put E at position 3, we might get feedback on whether there is another E? But that might be too early. We are only on the second guess.\n\nAlternatively, put I at position 4: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but I is at position 3? No, ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E, so I is at position 3. We want to avoid position 3.\n\nPosition 4: e.g., ""OXIDE"" (O, X, I, D, E). X is not very common, but it\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""OUNCE"" (O, U, N, C, E) -> but no I? We must include I because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include I.\n\nSo for position 4: ""NOISE"" -> but S is not allowed (we know S is absent). So invalid.\n\n""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> S is absent, so invalid.\n\n""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> I is at position 3? ""QUITE"" is Q-U-I-T-E, so I at 3 -> avoid.\n\n""URINE"" -> U, R, I, N, E -> R is absent, invalid.\n\n""ALIEN"" -> A is absent, invalid.\n\n""BEGIN"" -> B, E, G, I, N -> but E is at position 2? We need E at 5. So no.\n\nWe need a word with I in position 1,2, or 4 and E at 5, and no R, A, S.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n- Position 1: I _ _ _ E\n  - e.g., ""INLET"" (I, N, L, E, T) -> but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T -> no E at 5.\n  - ""IDLER"" -> R is absent, invalid.\n  - ""IGLOO"" -> no E at the end.\n\nActually, we need the fifth letter to be E. So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E\n\nAnd I must be in one of the first four positions, but not position 3 (because in the first guess, I was at 3 and was wrong position). So I can be at 1, 2, or 4.\n\nLet me think of words ending with E that have I at position 1, 2, or 4 and no R, A, S.\n\n- I at 1: ""IMAGE"" -> A invalid.\n  ""INODE"" (not common) \n  ""ICICLE"" too long.\n  ""ITCHY"" no E.\n\nHow about ""IMPLE"" not a word.\n\nCommon word: ""INVITE"" -> 6 letters.\n\n5-letter: ""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D -> but E is at position 4? ""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D -> E at 4, not 5.\n\nWe need E at 5. So the word must end with E.\n\nExamples: \n- I at 1: ""IXORA"" not ending with E.\n  ""INURE"" -> U, R -> R invalid.\n\nI at 2: e.g., ""TIGER"" -> R invalid.\n  ""TIMED"" -> M, E, D -> E at 4? ""TIMED"" is T-I-M-E-D -> E at 4, not 5.\n\nI at 4: e.g., ""MOVIE"" -> M, O, V, I, E -> I at 4, E at 5. And no R, A, S. This seems good.\n\n""MOVIE"" is a valid word. Let\'s use that.\n\nBut we also want to test other common letters. ""MOVIE"" has M, O, V, I, E. V is less common, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother option: ""NOBLE"" -> N, O, B, L, E -> but no I? We must include I because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot skip I.\n\nWe have to include I to get more information about its position.\n\nSo ""MOVIE"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother: ""TOWIE"" not common.\n\n""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E -> I at position 2, E at 5. And no R, A, S. This is also good.\n\n""BIOME"" vs ""MOVIE"": both are valid.\n\n""BIOME"" has B and M, which are common, and O.\n\n""MOVIE"" has M, O, V.\n\nB is more common than V, so ""BIOME"" might be better.\n\nBut let\'s see the positions: in ""BIOME"", I is at position 2. We haven\'t tried position 2 yet, so it\'s a good test.\n\nIn ""MOVIE"", I is at position 4, which we also haven\'t tried.\n\nBoth are acceptable. I\'ll go with ""BIOME"" because it has more common letters.\n\nBut note: we also have the letter E fixed at 5, so we can keep that.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CHIME"" -> C, H, I, M, E -> I at 3? ""CHIME"" is C-H-I-M-E -> I at position 3. We know I is not at position 3, so we should avoid putting I at 3 again. So ""CHIME"" is not good.\n\nSimilarly, ""GLIDE"" -> G, L, I, D, E -> I at 3 -> avoid.\n\nSo back to ""BIOME"" or ""MOVIE"".\n\nI think ""BIOME"" is a better choice because B is more common than V.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we know the word has I and E (with E at 5), and no R, A, S.\n\nAfter ""RAISE"" feedback, we have:\n\n- E is correct at 5.\n- I is present but not at 3.\n- R, A, S absent.\n\nSo for the next guess, we can also try to cover more new letters.\n\n""BIOME"" uses B, I, O, M, E. We already know E is in and at 5, and I is in (so we are testing its position). The new letters are B, O, M.\n\n""MOVIE"" uses M, O, V, I, E -> new letters M, O, V.\n\nBoth are similar, but V is less common than B, so ""BIOME"" might be better.\n\nAnother word: ""OZONE"" -> no I, invalid.\n\n""QUINE"" -> Q, U, I, N, E -> I at 3? ""QUINE"" is Q-U-I-N-E -> I at 3 -> avoid.\n\n""UNLIT"" -> no E.\n\nI think ""BIOME"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: is ""BIOME"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it means a biological community.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BIOME"".\n\nAlternatively, ""THINE"" -> T, H, I, N, E -> I at 3? ""THINE"" is T-H-I-N-E -> I at 3 -> avoid.\n\n""WHILE"" -> W, H, I, L, E -> I at 3 -> avoid.\n\n""GUILD"" -> no E.\n\nSo ""BIOME"" seems good.\n\nAnother option: ""DEICE"" -> D, E, I, C, E -> duplicate E? And E at position 2 and 5? We know E is at 5, but we don\'t know if there is another E. Also, I is at position 3 -> avoid.\n\n""NOISE"" -> S invalid.\n\nI think ""BIOME"" is the best.\n\nBut let\'s try to put I at position 1: ""ITCHY"" no E.\n\n""INNER"" -> R invalid.\n\n""IDIOM"" -> no E.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BIOME"".\n\nFinal decision: Guess ""BIOME"".Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""RAISE"" → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)), we know:\n- **E** is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.\n- **I** is in the word but not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4).\n- **R, A, S** are not in the word.\n\nFor Guess 2, I need to:\n- Keep **E** at position 5 (since it\'s confirmed correct).\n- Include **I** in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.\n- Avoid **R, A, S** entirely.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, M, N, T) to gather more information.\n\nI chose **""BIOME""** because:\n- It places **I** at position 2 (a new position to test, since position 3 is ruled out).\n- It keeps **E** at position 5.\n- It avoids R, A, S.\n- It introduces three new common letters: **B** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **M** (position 4), which are high-frequency and can reveal more about the secret word.\n- It\'s a valid 5-letter word (meaning a biological community).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of **I** and check for the presence of B, O, and M.\n\n<guess>biome</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: tags.\n\nSo for the first guess, I\'ll go with ""RAISE"".\n\nFinal decision: Guess ""RAISE"".\n</think>\nFor my first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain, especially given that I have no prior information about the secret word.

Based on the cumulative feedback so far:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
  - Interpretation: 
    - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
    - I is in the word but not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4).
    - R, A, S are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: BIOME** → Feedback: B(x) I(-) O(x) M(x) E(✓)
  - Interpretation:
    - E is still correctly placed at position 5 (no change).
    - I is still in the word but not at position 2 (since feedback shows ""-"" for I, meaning it's present but wrongly positioned here). 
    - Since I was previously ruled out from position 3 in Guess 1 and now position 2 in Guess 2, I must be at position 1 or 4.
    - B, O, M are not in the word.

### Key constraints for Guess 3:
1. **Secret word structure**: \_ \_ \_ \_ E
2. **I position**: Must be at position 1 or 4 (not 2/3/5).
3. **Confirmed absent letters**: R, A, S, B, O, M (so avoid these entirely).
4. **Present letters**: E (fixed at position 5) and I (somewhere in 1 or 4).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on testing **I at position 1 or 4** while confirming new common letters.
- Introduce other high-frequency letters like T, N, L, C, D, U, etc., to uncover more of the secret word.
- Prioritize words where **I is at position 1 or 4**, and avoid repeating known absent letters.
- Keep E at position 5 to maintain that confirmation.

### Brainstorming words:
- **I at position 1**: Pattern I \_ \_ \_ E (e.g., ""INLET"", but N and L are good tests).
  - But must avoid constraints: ""INLET"" has L, T, E—but E is fixed. However, ""INLET"" ends with T (position 5 isn't E? No, ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T → position 5 is T, not E). We need E at position 5 consistently. Adjust pattern: I \_ \_ \_ E.
  - Valid examples: 
    - ""ITCHY"" fails (no E at end). 
    - ""INFER"" → R absent (invalid). 
    - ""INCLE"" not common. 
    - ""INGLE"" (meaning fireside) → G, L tested. Possible but L has been untested so far.
- **I at position 4**: Pattern \_ \_ \_ I E (e.g., ""UTILE"" → tests U, T, L, I, E). U, T, L are common and untested—strong candidate. Remove absent letters? UTILE: no R,A,S,B,O,M → valid.

### Final selection: ""UTILE""
- Why ""UTILE""?
  - Tests **I at position 4** (if wrong, I must be at position 1, narrowing it further).
  - Introduces three new common letters: U (position 1), T (position 2), L (position 3).
  - Keeps E fixed at position 5.
  - Avoids all known absent letters: R,A,S,B,O,M.
- Alternative (""INGLE""): Similar benefit but less common; ""UTILE"" is a clearer test. 

This guess maximizes new information: If feedback shows U/T/L as present/absent, it tightly constrains possibilities for the next guess.

For my first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain, especially given that I have no prior information about the secret word. A strong starting word typically includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to cover as many possibilities as possible. Common choices in word games like Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"", as they contain frequent letters in English.

I choose ""RAISE"" because:
- It has three vowels (A, I, E), which are highly likely to appear in the secret word, helping to identify vowel presence quickly.
- It includes common consonants (R, S), improving the chances of hitting correct or misplaced consonants.
- No rare letters (like X or Z) are included, avoiding wasted guesses on less common options.

After this guess, the feedback will provide insights on the position and presence of each letter, which will inform my next guess.

A strong starting word typically includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to cover as many possibilities as possible. Common choices in word games like Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"", as they contain frequent letters in English.

I choose ""RAISE"" because:
- It has three vowels (A, I, E), which are highly likely to appear in the secret word, helping to identify vowel presence quickly.
- It includes common consonants (R, S), improving the chances of hitting correct or misplaced consonants.
- No rare letters (like X or Z) are included, avoiding wasted guesses on less common options.

After this guess, the feedback will provide insights on the position and presence of each letter, which will inform my next guess.

<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game, and the user has asked for the first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, I need to choose an optimal starting word.
 Common strategies suggest using words with multiple vowels and common consonants to maximize information. Words like ""RAISE"", ""ROATE"", ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", etc., are popular.
 I'll select ""RAISE"" as it contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S). This should help identify the presence and positions of several letters.
 
 For the response format: I'll think step by step and then output the guess in the required XML tag.

 Thought process:
 - First guess: Aim for high-entropy letters.
 - Word: ""RAISE"" (letters: R, A, I, S, E)
 - If I get feedback, it might show which letters are present and their positions.

 Output: <guess>raise</guess>For the first guess, I selected ""RAISE"" based on common Wordle strategy. It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two high-frequency consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance of getting meaningful feedback about the secret word's composition. This will help identify vowel placements and common consonants quickly. I have no prior information, so this is an optimal starting point.

For my first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain, especially given that I have no prior information about the secret word.

- It includes common consonants (R, S), improving the chances of hitting correct or misplaced consonants.

After this guess, the feedback will provide insights on the position and presence of each letter, which will inform my next guess.

<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""RAISE"": 
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: not in the word (x)
- I: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position (✓)

So, we know:
- The letter E is in the word and is the last letter (position 5).
- The letter I is in the word, but not in position 3 (since we got a '-' for that position). It must be in one of the first four positions (positions 1,2,3,4) but not 3.
- The letters R, A, and S are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have E at the end (position 5).
- Must contain the letter I, but not at position 3.
- Does not contain R, A, or S.

We need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.

Strategy for the next guess:
1. We must include the letter I (since it's in the word) and try it in a different position (not position 3). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.
2. We must include E at position 5 (since it's correct and we can confirm it stays).
3. Avoid using R, A, S (since they are absent).
4. Use other common letters to test for presence (e.g., T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.).

Given that I must be in the word and not at position 3, and E is fixed at position 5, let's think of words that fit:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E, and the word must contain I (somewhere in positions 1,2,4).

We also want to test other common letters to get more information.

Good candidate words:
- Try to put I in position 1: e.g., ""IMAGE"" (but note: A is not allowed, so avoid A).
- Avoid A, R, S.

Alternative: put I in position 2: e.g., ""TIGER"" (but R is not allowed) -> invalid.
- Put I in position 4: e.g., ""OPINE"" (O, P, I, N, E). This seems promising.

Check ""OPINE"":
- O: not yet tested (new)
- P: not yet tested
- I: we know it's in the word, but we are trying it at position 4 (which might be correct or not)
- N: not yet tested
- E: fixed at position 5 (correct)

But note: we have to avoid A, R, S. ""OPINE"" doesn't contain these, so it's okay.

Another option: ""QUITE"" (Q is less common, might not be ideal) or ""UNITE"" (U, N, I, T, E). ""UNITE"" has:
- U: new
- N: new
- I: at position 3? But wait, in ""UNITE"", I is at position 3. However, in our feedback, I was at position 3 in ""RAISE"" and it was marked as wrong position. That means I cannot be at position 3 in the secret word. So if we put I at position 3 again, we already know it's wrong. We should try I in a new position.

Therefore, avoid putting I at position 3. In ""UNITE"", I is at position 3, so that would be a wasted opportunity to test I in a new position.

Better: put I at position 1 or 2 or 4.

Let me try position 1: e.g., ""ICILY"" (but has I twice, and we don't know about duplicates? The feedback didn't indicate duplicate, but we don't know if the word has duplicate I. However, we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information). Also, ""ICILY"" has C, L, Y.

But let's think of words with I at position 1 and E at 5: e.g., ""INANE"" (but has A, which is not allowed) -> invalid.

Another: ""ILLEGAL"" is 7 letters, too long.

5-letter words: ""IMPEL"" (I, M, P, E, L) -> but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. So ""IMPEL"" has E at 4, not 5.

We need E at the end. So words ending with E.

How about ""OILIE""? Not a common word.

Better: ""OLIVE"" -> but V is new, and O, L, I, V, E. But I is at position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for I. In ""OLIVE"", I is at position 3 -> not good.

Put I at position 2: e.g., ""TITLE"" (T, I, T, L, E). But T appears twice? And we don't know about duplicates. Also, we have E at the end. But note: T is new, and we can test it. However, the double T might be an issue? But let's see: if the word has only one T, then we might get confusing feedback. Better to avoid duplicates for now.

Another: ""PIECE"" (P, I, E, C, E) -> duplicate E? And E is at position 3 and 5? We know E is at 5, but we don't know if there is another E. Also, I is at position 2. But ""PIECE"" has two E's, which might be acceptable, but we are testing I at position 2.

But we also have to avoid A, R, S. ""PIECE"" doesn't have them.

However, we already know E is at position 5, so if we put E at position 3, we might get feedback on whether there is another E? But that might be too early. We are only on the second guess.

Alternatively, put I at position 4: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but I is at position 3? No, ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E, so I is at position 3. We want to avoid position 3.

Position 4: e.g., ""OXIDE"" (O, X, I, D, E). X is not very common, but it's a valid word.

Another: ""OUNCE"" (O, U, N, C, E) -> but no I? We must include I because we know it's in the word. So we have to include I.

So for position 4: ""NOISE"" -> but S is not allowed (we know S is absent). So invalid.

""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> S is absent, so invalid.

""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> I is at position 3? ""QUITE"" is Q-U-I-T-E, so I at 3 -> avoid.

""URINE"" -> U, R, I, N, E -> R is absent, invalid.

""ALIEN"" -> A is absent, invalid.

""BEGIN"" -> B, E, G, I, N -> but E is at position 2? We need E at 5. So no.

We need a word with I in position 1,2, or 4 and E at 5, and no R, A, S.

Let me list possible words:
- Position 1: I _ _ _ E
  - e.g., ""INLET"" (I, N, L, E, T) -> but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T -> no E at 5.
  - ""IDLER"" -> R is absent, invalid.
  - ""IGLOO"" -> no E at the end.

Actually, we need the fifth letter to be E. So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E

And I must be in one of the first four positions, but not position 3 (because in the first guess, I was at 3 and was wrong position). So I can be at 1, 2, or 4.

Let me think of words ending with E that have I at position 1, 2, or 4 and no R, A, S.

- I at 1: ""IMAGE"" -> A invalid.
  ""INODE"" (not common) 
  ""ICICLE"" too long.
  ""ITCHY"" no E.

How about ""IMPLE"" not a word.

Common word: ""INVITE"" -> 6 letters.

5-letter: ""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D -> but E is at position 4? ""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D -> E at 4, not 5.

We need E at 5. So the word must end with E.

Examples: 
- I at 1: ""IXORA"" not ending with E.
  ""INURE"" -> U, R -> R invalid.

I at 2: e.g., ""TIGER"" -> R invalid.
  ""TIMED"" -> M, E, D -> E at 4? ""TIMED"" is T-I-M-E-D -> E at 4, not 5.

I at 4: e.g., ""MOVIE"" -> M, O, V, I, E -> I at 4, E at 5. And no R, A, S. This seems good.

""MOVIE"" is a valid word. Let's use that.

But we also want to test other common letters. ""MOVIE"" has M, O, V, I, E. V is less common, but it's acceptable.

Another option: ""NOBLE"" -> N, O, B, L, E -> but no I? We must include I because we know it's in the word. So we cannot skip I.

We have to include I to get more information about its position.

So ""MOVIE"" is a candidate.

Another: ""TOWIE"" not common.

""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E -> I at position 2, E at 5. And no R, A, S. This is also good.

""BIOME"" vs ""MOVIE"": both are valid.

""BIOME"" has B and M, which are common, and O.

""MOVIE"" has M, O, V.

B is more common than V, so ""BIOME"" might be better.

But let's see the positions: in ""BIOME"", I is at position 2. We haven't tried position 2 yet, so it's a good test.

In ""MOVIE"", I is at position 4, which we also haven't tried.

Both are acceptable. I'll go with ""BIOME"" because it has more common letters.

But note: we also have the letter E fixed at 5, so we can keep that.

Another candidate: ""CHIME"" -> C, H, I, M, E -> I at 3? ""CHIME"" is C-H-I-M-E -> I at position 3. We know I is not at position 3, so we should avoid putting I at 3 again. So ""CHIME"" is not good.

Similarly, ""GLIDE"" -> G, L, I, D, E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

So back to ""BIOME"" or ""MOVIE"".

I think ""BIOME"" is a better choice because B is more common than V.

But let's consider: we know the word has I and E (with E at 5), and no R, A, S.

After ""RAISE"" feedback, we have:

- E is correct at 5.
- I is present but not at 3.
- R, A, S absent.

So for the next guess, we can also try to cover more new letters.

""BIOME"" uses B, I, O, M, E. We already know E is in and at 5, and I is in (so we are testing its position). The new letters are B, O, M.

""MOVIE"" uses M, O, V, I, E -> new letters M, O, V.

Both are similar, but V is less common than B, so ""BIOME"" might be better.

Another word: ""OZONE"" -> no I, invalid.

""QUINE"" -> Q, U, I, N, E -> I at 3? ""QUINE"" is Q-U-I-N-E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

""UNLIT"" -> no E.

I think ""BIOME"" is a solid choice.

But let me confirm: is ""BIOME"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it means a biological community.

So I'll go with ""BIOME"".

Alternatively, ""THINE"" -> T, H, I, N, E -> I at 3? ""THINE"" is T-H-I-N-E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

""WHILE"" -> W, H, I, L, E -> I at 3 -> avoid.

""GUILD"" -> no E.

So ""BIOME"" seems good.

Another option: ""DEICE"" -> D, E, I, C, E -> duplicate E? And E at position 2 and 5? We know E is at 5, but we don't know if there is another E. Also, I is at position 3 -> avoid.

""NOISE"" -> S invalid.

I think ""BIOME"" is the best.

But let's try to put I at position 1: ""ITCHY"" no E.

""INNER"" -> R invalid.

""IDIOM"" -> no E.

So I'll go with ""BIOME"".

Final decision: Guess ""BIOME"".Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""RAISE"" → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)), we know:
- **E** is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
- **I** is in the word but not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4).
- **R, A, S** are not in the word.

For Guess 2, I need to:
- Keep **E** at position 5 (since it's confirmed correct).
- Include **I** in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.
- Avoid **R, A, S** entirely.
- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, M, N, T) to gather more information.

I chose **""BIOME""** because:
- It places **I** at position 2 (a new position to test, since position 3 is ruled out).
- It keeps **E** at position 5.
- It avoids R, A, S.
- It introduces three new common letters: **B** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **M** (position 4), which are high-frequency and can reveal more about the secret word.
- It's a valid 5-letter word (meaning a biological community).

This guess will help narrow down the position of **I** and check for the presence of B, O, and M.

So for the first guess, I'll go with ""RAISE"".

Final decision: Guess ""RAISE"".
</think>
For my first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain, especially given that I have no prior information about the secret word. A strong starting word typically includes a mix of common vowels and consonants to cover as many possibilities as possible. Common choices in word games like Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""RAISE"", as they contain frequent letters in English.

I choose ""RAISE"" because:
- It has three vowels (A, I, E), which are highly likely to appear in the secret word, helping to identify vowel presence quickly.
- It includes common consonants (R, S), improving the chances of hitting correct or misplaced consonants.
- No rare letters (like X or Z) are included, avoiding wasted guesses on less common options.

After this guess, the feedback will provide insights on the position and presence of each letter, which will inform my next guess.

<guess>raise -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
Guess 2: raise -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
Guess 3: biome -> FEEDBACK: B(x) I(-) O(x) M(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>Based on the cumulative feedback so far:

- **Guess 1: RAISE** → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)
  - Interpretation: 
    - E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
    - I is in the word but not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4).
    - R, A, S are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: BIOME** → Feedback: B(x) I(-) O(x) M(x) E(✓)
  - Interpretation:
    - E is still correctly placed at position 5 (no change).
    - I is still in the word but not at position 2 (since feedback shows ""-"" for I, meaning it's present but wrongly positioned here). 
    - Since I was previously ruled out from position 3 in Guess 1 and now position 2 in Guess 2, I must be at position 1 or 4.
    - B, O, M are not in the word.

### Key constraints for Guess 3:
1. **Secret word structure**: \_ \_ \_ \_ E
2. **I position**: Must be at position 1 or 4 (not 2/3/5).
3. **Confirmed absent letters**: R, A, S, B, O, M (so avoid these entirely).
4. **Present letters**: E (fixed at position 5) and I (somewhere in 1 or 4).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on testing **I at position 1 or 4** while confirming new common letters.
- Introduce other high-frequency letters like T, N, L, C, D, U, etc., to uncover more of the secret word.
- Prioritize words where **I is at position 1 or 4**, and avoid repeating known absent letters.
- Keep E at position 5 to maintain that confirmation.

### Brainstorming words:
- **I at position 1**: Pattern I \_ \_ \_ E (e.g., ""INLET"", but N and L are good tests).
  - But must avoid constraints: ""INLET"" has L, T, E—but E is fixed. However, ""INLET"" ends with T (position 5 isn't E? No, ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T → position 5 is T, not E). We need E at position 5 consistently. Adjust pattern: I \_ \_ \_ E.
  - Valid examples: 
    - ""ITCHY"" fails (no E at end). 
    - ""INFER"" → R absent (invalid). 
    - ""INCLE"" not common. 
    - ""INGLE"" (meaning fireside) → G, L tested. Possible but L has been untested so far.
- **I at position 4**: Pattern \_ \_ \_ I E (e.g., ""UTILE"" → tests U, T, L, I, E). U, T, L are common and untested—strong candidate. Remove absent letters? UTILE: no R,A,S,B,O,M → valid.

### Final selection: ""UTILE""
- Why ""UTILE""?
  - Tests **I at position 4** (if wrong, I must be at position 1, narrowing it further).
  - Introduces three new common letters: U (position 1), T (position 2), L (position 3).
  - Keeps E fixed at position 5.
  - Avoids all known absent letters: R,A,S,B,O,M.
- Alternative (""INGLE""): Similar benefit but less common; ""UTILE"" is a clearer test. 

This guess maximizes new information: If feedback shows U/T/L as present/absent, it tightly constrains possibilities for the next guess.Based on the cumulative feedback:
- **Guess 1: RAISE →** Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)  
  → **E** is in position 5, **I** is present but not in position 3, and **R/A/S** are absent.
- **Guess 2: BIOME →** Feedback: B(x) I(-) O(x) M(x) E(✓)  
  → **E** remains in position 5, **I** is present but not in position 2 (so it must be in position 1 or 4), and **B/O/M** are absent.

**Constraints for Guess 3:**
- Secret word format: \_ \_ \_ \_ E
- **I** must be at position 1 or 4.
- Absent letters (exclude these): R, A, S, B, O, M.
- Present letters: E (fixed at 5) and I.
- Introduce new letters like T, N, L, U, C, D to test common options.

**Thought process:**
- Test **I at position 4**, as position 1 has fewer common options that fit the pattern.
- Use high-frequency letters: Prioritize T, N, L, U, C for maximal coverage.
- **Selected word: UTILE** (U-T-I-L-E)  
  Why:
  - Puts I at position 4 (untested position).
  - Tests new consonants: U (position 1), T (position 2), L (position 3).
  - Keeps E at position 5 (confirmed).
  - Avoids all absent letters.
  - If I is misplaced, it must be at position 1; if U/T/L are feedback, it reveals key positions.

It must be in one of the first four positions (positions 1,2,3,4) but not 3.\n- The letters R, A, and S are not in the word at all.\n\nTherefore, the secret word:\n- Must have E at the end (position 5).\n- Must contain the letter I, but not at position 3.\n- Does not contain R, A, or S.\n\nWe need to make a second guess that incorporates this information.\n\nStrategy for the next guess:\n1. We must include the letter I (since it\'s in the word) and try it in a different position (not position 3). Possible positions: 1, 2, or 4.\n2. We must include E at position 5 (since it\'s correct and we can confirm it stays).\n3. Avoid using R, A, S (since they are absent).\n4. Use other common letters to test for presence (e.g., T, N, O, L, C, D, U, etc.).\n\nGiven that I must be in the word and not at position 3, and E is fixed at position 5, let\'s think of words that fit:\n- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E, and the word must contain I (somewhere in positions 1,2,4).\n\nWe also want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nGood candidate words:\n- Try to put I in position 1: e.g., ""IMAGE"" (but note: A is not allowed, so avoid A).\n- Avoid A, R, S.\n\nAlternative: put I in position 2: e.g., ""TIGER"" (but R is not allowed) -> invalid.\n- Put I in position 4: e.g., ""OPINE"" (O, P, I, N, E). This seems promising.\n\nCheck ""OPINE"":\n- O: not yet tested (new)\n- P: not yet tested\n- I: we know it\'s in the word, but we are trying it at position 4 (which might be correct or not)\n- N: not yet tested\n- E: fixed at position 5 (correct)\n\nBut note: we have to avoid A, R, S. ""OPINE"" doesn\'t contain these, so it\'s okay.\n\nAnother option: ""QUITE"" (Q is less common, might not be ideal) or ""UNITE"" (U, N, I, T, E). ""UNITE"" has:\n- U: new\n- N: new\n- I: at position 3? But wait, in ""UNITE"", I is at position 3. However, in our feedback, I was at position 3 in ""RAISE"" and it was marked as wrong position. That means I cannot be at position 3 in the secret word. So if we put I at position 3 again, we already know it\'s wrong. We should try I in a new position.\n\nTherefore, avoid putting I at position 3. In ""UNITE"", I is at position 3, so that would be a wasted opportunity to test I in a new position.\n\nBetter: put I at position 1 or 2 or 4.\n\nLet me try position 1: e.g., ""ICILY"" (but has I twice, and we don\'t know about duplicates? The feedback didn\'t indicate duplicate, but we don\'t know if the word has duplicate I. However, we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information). Also, ""ICILY"" has C, L, Y.\n\nBut let\'s think of words with I at position 1 and E at 5: e.g., ""INANE"" (but has A, which is not allowed) -> invalid.\n\nAnother: ""ILLEGAL"" is 7 letters, too long.\n\n5-letter words: ""IMPEL"" (I, M, P, E, L) -> but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. So ""IMPEL"" has E at 4, not 5.\n\nWe need E at the end. So words ending with E.\n\nHow about ""OILIE""? Not a common word.\n\nBetter: ""OLIVE"" -> but V is new, and O, L, I, V, E. But I is at position 3? We want to avoid position 3 for I. In ""OLIVE"", I is at position 3 -> not good.\n\nPut I at position 2: e.g., ""TITLE"" (T, I, T, L, E). But T appears twice? And we don\'t know about duplicates. Also, we have E at the end. But note: T is new, and we can test it. However, the double T might be an issue? But let\'s see: if the word has only one T, then we might get confusing feedback. Better to avoid duplicates for now.\n\nAnother: ""PIECE"" (P, I, E, C, E) -> duplicate E? And E is at position 3 and 5? We know E is at 5, but we don\'t know if there is another E. Also, I is at position 2. But ""PIECE"" has two E\'s, which might be acceptable, but we are testing I at position 2.\n\nBut we also have to avoid A, R, S. ""PIECE"" doesn\'t have them.\n\nHowever, we already know E is at position 5, so if we put E at position 3, we might get feedback on whether there is another E? But that might be too early. We are only on the second guess.\n\nAlternatively, put I at position 4: e.g., ""UNITE"" -> but I is at position 3? No, ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E, so I is at position 3. We want to avoid position 3.\n\nPosition 4: e.g., ""OXIDE"" (O, X, I, D, E). X is not very common, but it\'s a valid word.\n\nAnother: ""OUNCE"" (O, U, N, C, E) -> but no I? We must include I because we know it\'s in the word. So we have to include I.\n\nSo for position 4: ""NOISE"" -> but S is not allowed (we know S is absent). So invalid.\n\n""POISE"" -> P, O, I, S, E -> S is absent, so invalid.\n\n""QUITE"" -> Q, U, I, T, E -> I is at position 3? ""QUITE"" is Q-U-I-T-E, so I at 3 -> avoid.\n\n""URINE"" -> U, R, I, N, E -> R is absent, invalid.\n\n""ALIEN"" -> A is absent, invalid.\n\n""BEGIN"" -> B, E, G, I, N -> but E is at position 2? We need E at 5. So no.\n\nWe need a word with I in position 1,2, or 4 and E at 5, and no R, A, S.\n\nLet me list possible words:\n- Position 1: I _ _ _ E\n  - e.g., ""INLET"" (I, N, L, E, T) -> but E is at position 4? We need E at 5. ""INLET"" is I-N-L-E-T -> no E at 5.\n  - ""IDLER"" -> R is absent, invalid.\n  - ""IGLOO"" -> no E at the end.\n\nActually, we need the fifth letter to be E. So the pattern is: _ _ _ _ E\n\nAnd I must be in one of the first four positions, but not position 3 (because in the first guess, I was at 3 and was wrong position). So I can be at 1, 2, or 4.\n\nLet me think of words ending with E that have I at position 1, 2, or 4 and no R, A, S.\n\n- I at 1: ""IMAGE"" -> A invalid.\n  ""INODE"" (not common) \n  ""ICICLE"" too long.\n  ""ITCHY"" no E.\n\nHow about ""IMPLE"" not a word.\n\nCommon word: ""INVITE"" -> 6 letters.\n\n5-letter: ""OILED"" -> O, I, L, E, D -> but E is at position 4? ""OILED"" is O-I-L-E-D -> E at 4, not 5.\n\nWe need E at 5. So the word must end with E.\n\nExamples: \n- I at 1: ""IXORA"" not ending with E.\n  ""INURE"" -> U, R -> R invalid.\n\nI at 2: e.g., ""TIGER"" -> R invalid.\n  ""TIMED"" -> M, E, D -> E at 4? ""TIMED"" is T-I-M-E-D -> E at 4, not 5.\n\nI at 4: e.g., ""MOVIE"" -> M, O, V, I, E -> I at 4, E at 5. And no R, A, S. This seems good.\n\n""MOVIE"" is a valid word. Let\'s use that.\n\nBut we also want to test other common letters. ""MOVIE"" has M, O, V, I, E. V is less common, but it\'s acceptable.\n\nAnother option: ""NOBLE"" -> N, O, B, L, E -> but no I? We must include I because we know it\'s in the word. So we cannot skip I.\n\nWe have to include I to get more information about its position.\n\nSo ""MOVIE"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother: ""TOWIE"" not common.\n\n""BIOME"" -> B, I, O, M, E -> I at position 2, E at 5. And no R, A, S. This is also good.\n\n""BIOME"" vs ""MOVIE"": both are valid.\n\n""BIOME"" has B and M, which are common, and O.\n\n""MOVIE"" has M, O, V.\n\nB is more common than V, so ""BIOME"" might be better.\n\nBut let\'s see the positions: in ""BIOME"", I is at position 2. We haven\'t tried position 2 yet, so it\'s a good test.\n\nIn ""MOVIE"", I is at position 4, which we also haven\'t tried.\n\nBoth are acceptable. I\'ll go with ""BIOME"" because it has more common letters.\n\nBut note: we also have the letter E fixed at 5, so we can keep that.\n\nAnother candidate: ""CHIME"" -> C, H, I, M, E -> I at 3? ""CHIME"" is C-H-I-M-E -> I at position 3. We know I is not at position 3, so we should avoid putting I at 3 again. So ""CHIME"" is not good.\n\nSimilarly, ""GLIDE"" -> G, L, I, D, E -> I at 3 -> avoid.\n\nSo back to ""BIOME"" or ""MOVIE"".\n\nI think ""BIOME"" is a better choice because B is more common than V.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we know the word has I and E (with E at 5), and no R, A, S.\n\nAfter ""RAISE"" feedback, we have:\n\n- E is correct at 5.\n- I is present but not at 3.\n- R, A, S absent.\n\nSo for the next guess, we can also try to cover more new letters.\n\n""BIOME"" uses B, I, O, M, E. We already know E is in and at 5, and I is in (so we are testing its position). The new letters are B, O, M.\n\n""MOVIE"" uses M, O, V, I, E -> new letters M, O, V.\n\nBoth are similar, but V is less common than B, so ""BIOME"" might be better.\n\nAnother word: ""OZONE"" -> no I, invalid.\n\n""QUINE"" -> Q, U, I, N, E -> I at 3? ""QUINE"" is Q-U-I-N-E -> I at 3 -> avoid.\n\n""UNLIT"" -> no E.\n\nI think ""BIOME"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: is ""BIOME"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes, it means a biological community.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BIOME"".\n\nAlternatively, ""THINE"" -> T, H, I, N, E -> I at 3? ""THINE"" is T-H-I-N-E -> I at 3 -> avoid.\n\n""WHILE"" -> W, H, I, L, E -> I at 3 -> avoid.\n\n""GUILD"" -> no E.\n\nSo ""BIOME"" seems good.\n\nAnother option: ""DEICE"" -> D, E, I, C, E -> duplicate E? And E at position 2 and 5? We know E is at 5, but we don\'t know if there is another E. Also, I is at position 3 -> avoid.\n\n""NOISE"" -> S invalid.\n\nI think ""BIOME"" is the best.\n\nBut let\'s try to put I at position 1: ""ITCHY"" no E.\n\n""INNER"" -> R invalid.\n\n""IDIOM"" -> no E.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""BIOME"".\n\nFinal decision: Guess ""BIOME"".Based on the feedback from Guess 1 (""RAISE"" → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)), we know:\n- **E** is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.\n- **I** is in the word but not at position 3 (so it must be at position 1, 2, or 4).\n- **R, A, S** are not in the word.\n\nFor Guess 2, I need to:\n- Keep **E** at position 5 (since it\'s confirmed correct).\n- Include **I** in a new position (1, 2, or 4) to test its location.\n- Avoid **R, A, S** entirely.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., B, O, M, N, T) to gather more information.\n\nI chose **""BIOME""** because:\n- It places **I** at position 2 (a new position to test, since position 3 is ruled out).\n- It keeps **E** at position 5.\n- It avoids R, A, S.\n- It introduces three new common letters: **B** (position 1), **O** (position 3), and **M** (position 4), which are high-frequency and can reveal more about the secret word.\n- It\'s a valid 5-letter word (meaning a biological community).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the position of **I** and check for the presence of B, O, and M.\n\n<guess>biome</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: tags.\n\nSo for the first guess, I\'ll go with ""RAISE"".\n\nFinal decision: Guess ""RAISE"".\n</think>\nFor my first guess, I need a word that maximizes information gain, especially given that I have no prior information about the secret word.

We have the cumulative feedback from all guesses:

**Guess 1: ""RAISE"" → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)**
- E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
- I is in the word but not at position 3.
- R, A, S are absent.

**Guess 2: ""BIOME"" → Feedback: B(x) I(-) O(x) M(x) E(✓)**
- E remains correctly placed at position 5.
- I is still in the word but now confirmed not at position 2 (since it's misplaced in this guess).
- B, O, M are absent.

**Guess 3: ""UTILE"" → Feedback: U(✓) T(-) I(-) L(x) E(✓)**
- U is correctly placed at position 1.
- T is in the word but not at position 2.
- I is still present but not at position 4 (since it's misplaced here).
- L is absent.
- E remains correctly placed at position 5.

### Key deductions:
1. **Position 1**: U is correct and fixed (from last feedback).
2. **Position 5**: E is correct and fixed (consistent).
3. **I's position**: 
   - Previously, I couldn't be at position 3 (Guess 1), position 2 (Guess 2), or position 4 (Guess 3). 
   - Therefore, **I must be at position 1**? But position 1 is now U (fixed), so contradiction? 
   - Wait: Position 1 is U, so I cannot be at position 1. But positions 2,3,4 are possible? No, because:
     - Position 3 was ruled out by Guess 1 (I was at position 3 in ""RAISE"" and got misplaced).
     - Position 2 was ruled out by Guess 2 (I at position 2 in ""BIOME"" got misplaced).
     - Position 4 was ruled out by Guess 3 (I at position 4 in ""UTILE"" got misplaced).
   - The only possibility left is that I is in the word, but at a position we haven't tested yet. But we've covered positions 2,3,4? We haven't explicitly tested position 1, but now position 1 is U. So where can I be?
   - This suggests the word might have **duplicate letters**, specifically **two I's**? But so far, no guess has placed I at a position that matches.

4. **T**: Is in the word (feedback (-) at position 2) but not at position 2, so T must be at position 3 or 4.
5. **Absent letters**: R, A, S, B, O, M, L (from all feedback).

Thus, the secret word must have:
- Starts with: **U** (position 1)
- Ends with: **E** (position 5)
- Contains: **I** (somewhere, but all positions seem conflicting) and **T** (at position 3 or 4).
- Since I has been misplaced in every position (2,3,4) but position 1 is impossible (taken by U), the word must include **I in a duplicated position**, or require reinterpreting the feedback.

### Re-checking feedback context:
- Guess 1: I was at position 3 → wrong position → so I is not at position 3.
- Guess 2: I was at position 2 → wrong position → so I is not at position 2.
- Guess 3: I was at position 4 → wrong position → so I is not at position 4.
- Position 1 is U, fixed → I cannot be at position 1.

But the presence of I is confirmed (- in all cases). Therefore:
- The most likely explanation is that there is a **duplicate I**: the secret word has more than one I, and one I is in a position not yet correctly identified.

Additionally, T is present and not at position 2, so position 3 or 4.

Possible positions for I:
- Since positions 2,3,4 are all ruled out individually, one of them may have I if we consider duplicates:
  - If the secret word has two I's, we could have I at position 2 and another at position 3, etc.

But we need to satisfy all feedback:
- Position 3: In Guess 1, we had I at position 3 and got '-', meaning the letter I is in the word but not at that position for that instance? Actually, feedback is per letter occurrence. Since ""RAISE"" had I at position 3 and got '-', that means at least one I is not at position 3. But if there's a duplicate, another I could be at position 3? 
  - Standard Wordle rules: Feedback does not distinguish between instances unless they are both present in the word. Specifically:
    - A '-' indicates that a specific occurrence (position) has the letter somewhere else in the word, but not necessarily that the letter cannot be duplicated.
    - With duplicates: If the guess has one I and the secret has two I's, the feedback might show '-' for a wrongly placed I even if another I is at the same position? But typically, if the secret has a duplicate, and the guess has one I, then:
      - If that I is in a correct position, then ✓ for that one instance and nothing for the duplicate in guess.
      - If that I is in a wrong position, then '-' for that instance.
    - But if the secret has an I at a position where guess doesn't have I, it won't show in feedback.

So for I:
- Presence of I is confirmed by Guess 1 (where we got '-'), but it doesn't specify duplicates.
- To have been misplaced in all guesses, it's likely that I must be at either position 3 or another position we haven't tested correctly with a duplicate.

But given the constraints, we must test a word that accounts for possible duplicates and positions for T and I.

Current known structure: U _ _ _ E

Absent letters: R,A,S,B,O,M,L

Present letters: U, T, E, I (and T must be at position 3 or 4).

Since T is at - in position 2, T cannot be at position 2.

Therefore, T must be at position 3 or 4.

Similarly, I must be somewhere, but not in a way that conflicts with the positions we've tried? But all positions 2,3,4 have been tried and got '-', meaning for each instance, that specific position was incorrect, but duplicates might allow I to exist elsewhere.

Given U is at position 1, E at position 5, T must be at 3 or 4. And I must be at one of 2,3,4, but since each time we placed I at a different position and got '-', that suggests:
- The position of I is not 2, not 3, not 4? But that's impossible unless duplicate.

Given the confusion, let's assume a word with a duplicate might be possible.

Common words fitting U _ _ _ E with T and I present.

Possible words:
- ""UNTIE"" → U, N, T, I, E → But ""UNTIE"":
  - Position 3: T → feedback for T should be tested? Let's check against constraints:
    - U at 1: ✓
    - E at 5: ✓
    - Previous feedback: T is present but not at position 2? ""UNTIE"" has T at position 3.
    - But in Guess 3 (""UTILE""), we had T at position 2 → got '-', meaning T is not at position 2 → which is good because ""UNTIE"" puts T at position 3.
  - For I: ""UNTIE"" has I at position 4.
    - In Guess 3 (""UTILE""), I is at position 4 →? But Guess 3 got '-' for I at position 4? So if I is at position 4 in secret, we should get ✓? Or at least the '-' suggests that the placement at position 4 wasn't correct? But in Guess 3, I was at position 4 and got '-', which means that in the secret word, I is not at position 4 → contradiction? Unless duplicate.

But ""UNTIE"" has I at position 4. So if we guessed ""UTILE"" with I at position 4 and got '-', it means that the secret word's I is not at position 4. So ""UNTIE"" would contradict because it places I at position 4.

Similarly:

Another word: ""UTILE"" is already guessed → we need new word.

How about ""UNITE""? U-N-I-T-E → I at position 3? 
- In Guess 1: ""RAISE"" had I at position 3 → got '-', meaning I is not at position 3? So if ""UNITE"" has I at position 3, it would be incorrect? But standard rules: one '-' doesn't prevent duplicate? Actually, no: the '-' in Guess 1 means that the specific instance of I in position 3 is not in the correct place for any I. If the secret has only one I, then that '-' rules out I at position 3. But if multiple, it could be elsewhere.

However, given that in Guess 2 and Guess 3, we got '-' for I at positions 2 and 4, it suggests that the I is consistently misplaced, so likely there's only one I.

But let's consider the possibility of duplicate:

Assume the secret has two I's. Then:
- Guess 1: I at position 3 → other I (in secret) is at different position → so '-' feedback.
- Guess 2: I at position 2 → other I (in secret) at different position → again '-'.
- Guess 3: I at position 4 → and if secret has I only at position 3 and 2, then '-' indicates it's not at position 4? But secret has I at position 3 → not the same as the guess position? Would it still show '-'? Yes.

But position 1 is U, and position 5 is E, so I could only be at positions 2,3,4? Thus, if there is a duplicate, it must occupy two of 2,3,4.

Given the constraints from feedback:
- We know T must be present at position 3 or 4? And I must be at one of 2,3,4? With U and E fixed.

Therefore, a word like ""UTTIE"" (not common) or valid one is ""UNITE"".

But ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E:
- Positions: U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.
- Now, check against our guesses:
  - Guess 1: ""RAISE"" had I at 3 → '-' ; which is consistent if the secret's I is at position 3? No, because '-' means it's not at that position → contradiction.

Therefore, duplicate is the only way? Other possibility: the feedback for I in Guess 3 being '-' doesn't necessarily mean it's not at position 4 if there's a duplicate? But standard interpretation is that for each position, if it's not correct, and the letter exists, then '-'.

So with the '-' for Guess 3 at position 4, if the secret has I at 4, then we should have ✓ or at least the '-' means that position is not correct. But if a different I is there? No, because the '-' corresponds to the letter in that position in the guess not being secret's letter in that position. For duplicates, if the secret has I at position 4 and also at another position, and we guess I at position 4, we would get ✓ or '-'? If secret has two I's and we have one I at position 4, and one matches, then it should be ✓? Because both are present. So for Guess 3, when we put I at position 4, if the secret has I at position 4, we would get ✓ or not? If only one I in secret and at position 4, then ✓. If secret has I at position 4 and also elsewhere, then ✓ if it's in the same position? Then the duplicate is not indicated by feedback.

Standard duplicate handling:
- If the guess has one I, and secret has two I's, then:
  - If the guessed I is in the correct position → ✓
  - If the guessed I is in a wrong position → '-' , but the other I in secret elsewhere wouldn't be represented.
  - If the guessed I is not in word → 'x'
- But we don't know about the other I from feedback? Only known by explicit guesses.

So for I- we know: in each guess, the guessed I at positions 3,2,4 were not correct for any occurrence? Not necessarily; when there is a duplicate, a '-' could mean that the letter is in the word but that specific occurrence is misplaced.

Therefore, it's possibe that I is at position 4 in the secret? But in Guess 3, when we guessed I at position 4, we got '-', which suggests that there is no I at position 4 in the secret? Or if there is, but it wasn't matched? Actually, if secret has I at position 4, and we guess I at position 4, it should be ✓, not '-', because we have exactly that position.

Therefore, the feedback from Guess 3's I at position 4 is '-', which must mean that in the secret word, there is no I at position 4.

Similarly, Guess 2: '-' for I at position 2 means no I at position 2.
Guess 1: '-' for I at position 3 means no I at position 3.

AND with position 1 occupied by U, then where are the I's? Only possibility is that the word has no I at all? But we have confirmation that I is in the word via Guess 1 '-' which indicates presence? Yes, '-' in feedback means the letter is in the word but not at that position.

So the presence of I is confirmed by Guess 1. Therefore, if not at positions 1,2,3,4, then position 5 is E, fixed? So cannot be.

This implies a logical error, but let's trust the feedback.

Perhaps I must be at position 4 after all? But the feedback from Guess 3 for I at position 4 was '-', which by standard rules means that the secret does not have I at that position (position 4).

So the only remaining explanation is that the word has only one I, and it must be at position 1 or 5, but position 1 is U, position 5 is E, so impossible.

Unless feedback is misinterpreted.

Alternative: in Guess 3 (""UTILE"") → feedback U(✓) T(-) I(-) L(x) E(✓)
Each feedback symbol corresponds to the letter at that position:
- Position 1: U is ✓
- Position 2: T is '-' → so T is in the word, just not at position 2
- Position 3: T? No, position 3 in ""UTILE"" is I (""U-T-I-L-E"") positions:1-U,2-T,3-I,4-L,5-E
But we got I at position 3 with '-'? ""UTILE"" positions:1-U,2-T,3-I,4-L,5-E.

So feedback:
- U(1) = ✓
- T(2) = '-'
- I(3) = '-'
- L(4) = x
- E(5) = ✓

So for position 3: I got '-' which means I is in the word but not at position 3.

But we already knew I is not at position 3 from Guess 1.

And Guess 2 and Guess 3 show I is not at positions 2 and 4.

So again, contradiction.

Unless the feedback for Guess 1 was for ""RAISE"" which had its own positions.

Perhaps the secret word is ""UTILE"" but with I at a different location? But that's not possible because E is at 5.

Or the word might be ""TUILE"" or ""EUIIS"" not possible.

Another possibility: we have U fixed at 1, E fixed at 5, and T present somewhere. For I, given all '-' at many positions, perhaps the secret word has I at position 3 or where not previously guessed? They are all covered.

Therefore, I think the word must be ""UNTIE"" or something similar, and the feedback for I might have been mistaken, or perhaps it's ""UNITE"" by earlier feedback.

But let's consider known information: U at 1, E at 5, T present (position 3 or 4), and I present (somewhere).

Absent letters: R,A,S,B,O,M,L

So we try ""UNTIE"": U-N-T-I-E →  1-U,2-N,3-T,4-I,5-E
Check feedback against previous:
- In Guess 3: when we had ""UTILE"" (position 3: I), we got '-' for I, which would be consistent if secret has I at position 4? In ""UTILE"" we guessed I at position 3, not 4? Positions in ""UTILE"": position 3 is I, position 4 is L.

For ""UNTIE"": secret.
- If secret is ""UNTIE"", then:
  - Guess 1: RAISE → position 3: I should be '-' (since I is at secret's position 4) → consistent.
  - Guess 2: BIOME → position 2: I should be '-' (since I in secret is at 4, not 2) → consistent.
  - Guess 3: UTILE → positions:
     - U: position 1: ✓ (both U)
     - T: position 2: guessed T at 2, secret has T at position 3? So T is in word but not at position 2 → '-' which matches feedback.
     - I: position 3: guessed I at 3, secret has I at position 4? So I is in word but not at position 3 → '-' which matches.
     - L: position 4: guessed L, but secret has I at 4 (not L), so L is not in word → 'x' which matches.
     - E: position 5: ✓
  - Therefore, it fits: the secret word is likely ""UNTIE"".

But ""UNTIE"" has I at position 4, and in Guess 3, we got '-' for I at position 3? That I is not at position 3, so if secret has I at 4, it should not affect the feedback for position 3.

So ""UNTIE"" should feedback for Guess 3 exactly as given.

But previously, I thought Guess 3 was for position 4? No, in ""UTILE"", I was at position 3, not 4.

""UTILE"" breakdown:
- U (pos1)
- T (pos2)
- I (pos3)
- L (pos4)
- E (pos5)

Feedback: I at position 3 got '-', meaning I is not at position 3 in secret? Which is correct if secret has I at position 4.

Also, position 4 in guess is L and got 'x' — OK.

So ""UNTIE"" fits: U-N-T-I-E

Now, the word must confirm if N is present? Not yet tested.

To be safe, we can guess ""UNTIE"".

But how about ""UNITE""? U-N-I-T-E → positions 3: I, position 4: T

In this case:
- I is at position 3.
- But in Guess 1, ""RAISE"" had I at position 3 and got '-' , if secret has I at position 3, we should get ✓, not '-', because it would be correct. So it cannot be ""UNITE"" if I is at position 3.

Therefore, only ""UNTIE"" works so far.

Another word: ""UNTIE"" means to unfasten. Valid.

Other option: ""URITE"" not common.

So I will guess ""UNTIE"".

If incorrect, feedback will give more info.

Based on the cumulative feedback and deductions:

### Feedback Summary:
- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)  
  → E is fixed at position 5; I is present but not at position 3; R, A, S absent.
- **Guess 2: BIOME** → B(x) I(-) O(x) M(x) E(✓)  
  → E (position 5) confirmed; I present but not at position 2; B, O, M absent.
- **Guess 3: UTILE** → U(✓) T(-) I(-) L(x) E(✓)  
  → U fixed at position 1; E fixed at position 5; T present but not at position 2; I present but not at position 3 or 4; L absent.

### Key Constraints:
- **Secret word**: U _ _ _ E
- **Fixed positions**: 
  - Position 1: U
  - Position 5: E
- **Present letters**: 
  - **T**: Must be at position 3 or 4 (since it's not at position 2).
  - **I**: Present but ruled out from positions 2, 3, and 4 in previous guesses. As position 1 is occupied, the only possibility is that I is at position 4 (since position 3 is reserved for T in a likely word structure).
- **Absent letters**: R, A, S, B, O, M, L (must be avoided).
- New letters introduced: N (common consonant; untested).

### Deduction Process:
- The secret word starts with U, ends with E, and contains T and I.
- Given I is not at positions 2, 3, or 4 (from consecutive misplacements), position 4 must belong to I (the only remaining spot).
- T must then be at position 3 (since it can't be at 2, and position 4 is now I).
- Position 2 must be filled with an untested letter. High-frequency consonants like N are ideal for testing.
- **""UNTIE""** fits perfectly: 
  - U (position 1 ✓), N (untested), T (position 3 ✓), I (position 4 ✓), E (position 5 ✓). 
  - Uses common letters, avoids all absent characters, and confirms T/I placements.

This guess resolves positional conflicts and leverages feedback efficiently. If ""UNTIE"" is incorrect, feedback will clarify N or other letters.

<guess>untie</guess>",untie,"We have the cumulative feedback from all guesses:

**Guess 1: ""RAISE"" → Feedback: R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)**
- E is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.
- I is in the word but not at position 3.
- R, A, S are absent.

**Guess 2: ""BIOME"" → Feedback: B(x) I(-) O(x) M(x) E(✓)**
- E remains correctly placed at position 5.
- I is still in the word but now confirmed not at position 2 (since it's misplaced in this guess).
- B, O, M are absent.

**Guess 3: ""UTILE"" → Feedback: U(✓) T(-) I(-) L(x) E(✓)**
- U is correctly placed at position 1.
- T is in the word but not at position 2.
- I is still present but not at position 4 (since it's misplaced here).
- L is absent.
- E remains correctly placed at position 5.

### Key deductions:
1. **Position 1**: U is correct and fixed (from last feedback).
2. **Position 5**: E is correct and fixed (consistent).
3. **I's position**: 
   - Previously, I couldn't be at position 3 (Guess 1), position 2 (Guess 2), or position 4 (Guess 3). 
   - Therefore, **I must be at position 1**? But position 1 is now U (fixed), so contradiction? 
   - Wait: Position 1 is U, so I cannot be at position 1. But positions 2,3,4 are possible? No, because:
     - Position 3 was ruled out by Guess 1 (I was at position 3 in ""RAISE"" and got misplaced).
     - Position 2 was ruled out by Guess 2 (I at position 2 in ""BIOME"" got misplaced).
     - Position 4 was ruled out by Guess 3 (I at position 4 in ""UTILE"" got misplaced).
   - The only possibility left is that I is in the word, but at a position we haven't tested yet. But we've covered positions 2,3,4? We haven't explicitly tested position 1, but now position 1 is U. So where can I be?
   - This suggests the word might have **duplicate letters**, specifically **two I's**? But so far, no guess has placed I at a position that matches.

4. **T**: Is in the word (feedback (-) at position 2) but not at position 2, so T must be at position 3 or 4.
5. **Absent letters**: R, A, S, B, O, M, L (from all feedback).

Thus, the secret word must have:
- Starts with: **U** (position 1)
- Ends with: **E** (position 5)
- Contains: **I** (somewhere, but all positions seem conflicting) and **T** (at position 3 or 4).
- Since I has been misplaced in every position (2,3,4) but position 1 is impossible (taken by U), the word must include **I in a duplicated position**, or require reinterpreting the feedback.

### Re-checking feedback context:
- Guess 1: I was at position 3 → wrong position → so I is not at position 3.
- Guess 2: I was at position 2 → wrong position → so I is not at position 2.
- Guess 3: I was at position 4 → wrong position → so I is not at position 4.
- Position 1 is U, fixed → I cannot be at position 1.

But the presence of I is confirmed (- in all cases). Therefore:
- The most likely explanation is that there is a **duplicate I**: the secret word has more than one I, and one I is in a position not yet correctly identified.

Additionally, T is present and not at position 2, so position 3 or 4.

Possible positions for I:
- Since positions 2,3,4 are all ruled out individually, one of them may have I if we consider duplicates:
  - If the secret word has two I's, we could have I at position 2 and another at position 3, etc.

But we need to satisfy all feedback:
- Position 3: In Guess 1, we had I at position 3 and got '-', meaning the letter I is in the word but not at that position for that instance? Actually, feedback is per letter occurrence. Since ""RAISE"" had I at position 3 and got '-', that means at least one I is not at position 3. But if there's a duplicate, another I could be at position 3? 
  - Standard Wordle rules: Feedback does not distinguish between instances unless they are both present in the word. Specifically:
    - A '-' indicates that a specific occurrence (position) has the letter somewhere else in the word, but not necessarily that the letter cannot be duplicated.
    - With duplicates: If the guess has one I and the secret has two I's, the feedback might show '-' for a wrongly placed I even if another I is at the same position? But typically, if the secret has a duplicate, and the guess has one I, then:
      - If that I is in a correct position, then ✓ for that one instance and nothing for the duplicate in guess.
      - If that I is in a wrong position, then '-' for that instance.
    - But if the secret has an I at a position where guess doesn't have I, it won't show in feedback.

So for I:
- Presence of I is confirmed by Guess 1 (where we got '-'), but it doesn't specify duplicates.
- To have been misplaced in all guesses, it's likely that I must be at either position 3 or another position we haven't tested correctly with a duplicate.

But given the constraints, we must test a word that accounts for possible duplicates and positions for T and I.

Current known structure: U _ _ _ E

Absent letters: R,A,S,B,O,M,L

Present letters: U, T, E, I (and T must be at position 3 or 4).

Since T is at - in position 2, T cannot be at position 2.

Therefore, T must be at position 3 or 4.

Similarly, I must be somewhere, but not in a way that conflicts with the positions we've tried? But all positions 2,3,4 have been tried and got '-', meaning for each instance, that specific position was incorrect, but duplicates might allow I to exist elsewhere.

Given U is at position 1, E at position 5, T must be at 3 or 4. And I must be at one of 2,3,4, but since each time we placed I at a different position and got '-', that suggests:
- The position of I is not 2, not 3, not 4? But that's impossible unless duplicate.

Given the confusion, let's assume a word with a duplicate might be possible.

Common words fitting U _ _ _ E with T and I present.

Possible words:
- ""UNTIE"" → U, N, T, I, E → But ""UNTIE"":
  - Position 3: T → feedback for T should be tested? Let's check against constraints:
    - U at 1: ✓
    - E at 5: ✓
    - Previous feedback: T is present but not at position 2? ""UNTIE"" has T at position 3.
    - But in Guess 3 (""UTILE""), we had T at position 2 → got '-', meaning T is not at position 2 → which is good because ""UNTIE"" puts T at position 3.
  - For I: ""UNTIE"" has I at position 4.
    - In Guess 3 (""UTILE""), I is at position 4 →? But Guess 3 got '-' for I at position 4? So if I is at position 4 in secret, we should get ✓? Or at least the '-' suggests that the placement at position 4 wasn't correct? But in Guess 3, I was at position 4 and got '-', which means that in the secret word, I is not at position 4 → contradiction? Unless duplicate.

But ""UNTIE"" has I at position 4. So if we guessed ""UTILE"" with I at position 4 and got '-', it means that the secret word's I is not at position 4. So ""UNTIE"" would contradict because it places I at position 4.

Similarly:

Another word: ""UTILE"" is already guessed → we need new word.

How about ""UNITE""? U-N-I-T-E → I at position 3? 
- In Guess 1: ""RAISE"" had I at position 3 → got '-', meaning I is not at position 3? So if ""UNITE"" has I at position 3, it would be incorrect? But standard rules: one '-' doesn't prevent duplicate? Actually, no: the '-' in Guess 1 means that the specific instance of I in position 3 is not in the correct place for any I. If the secret has only one I, then that '-' rules out I at position 3. But if multiple, it could be elsewhere.

However, given that in Guess 2 and Guess 3, we got '-' for I at positions 2 and 4, it suggests that the I is consistently misplaced, so likely there's only one I.

But let's consider the possibility of duplicate:

Assume the secret has two I's. Then:
- Guess 1: I at position 3 → other I (in secret) is at different position → so '-' feedback.
- Guess 2: I at position 2 → other I (in secret) at different position → again '-'.
- Guess 3: I at position 4 → and if secret has I only at position 3 and 2, then '-' indicates it's not at position 4? But secret has I at position 3 → not the same as the guess position? Would it still show '-'? Yes.

But position 1 is U, and position 5 is E, so I could only be at positions 2,3,4? Thus, if there is a duplicate, it must occupy two of 2,3,4.

Given the constraints from feedback:
- We know T must be present at position 3 or 4? And I must be at one of 2,3,4? With U and E fixed.

Therefore, a word like ""UTTIE"" (not common) or valid one is ""UNITE"".

But ""UNITE"" is U-N-I-T-E:
- Positions: U at 1, N at 2, I at 3, T at 4, E at 5.
- Now, check against our guesses:
  - Guess 1: ""RAISE"" had I at 3 → '-' ; which is consistent if the secret's I is at position 3? No, because '-' means it's not at that position → contradiction.

Therefore, duplicate is the only way? Other possibility: the feedback for I in Guess 3 being '-' doesn't necessarily mean it's not at position 4 if there's a duplicate? But standard interpretation is that for each position, if it's not correct, and the letter exists, then '-'.

So with the '-' for Guess 3 at position 4, if the secret has I at 4, then we should have ✓ or at least the '-' means that position is not correct. But if a different I is there? No, because the '-' corresponds to the letter in that position in the guess not being secret's letter in that position. For duplicates, if the secret has I at position 4 and also at another position, and we guess I at position 4, we would get ✓ or '-'? If secret has two I's and we have one I at position 4, and one matches, then it should be ✓? Because both are present. So for Guess 3, when we put I at position 4, if the secret has I at position 4, we would get ✓ or not? If only one I in secret and at position 4, then ✓. If secret has I at position 4 and also elsewhere, then ✓ if it's in the same position? Then the duplicate is not indicated by feedback.

Standard duplicate handling:
- If the guess has one I, and secret has two I's, then:
  - If the guessed I is in the correct position → ✓
  - If the guessed I is in a wrong position → '-' , but the other I in secret elsewhere wouldn't be represented.
  - If the guessed I is not in word → 'x'
- But we don't know about the other I from feedback? Only known by explicit guesses.

So for I- we know: in each guess, the guessed I at positions 3,2,4 were not correct for any occurrence? Not necessarily; when there is a duplicate, a '-' could mean that the letter is in the word but that specific occurrence is misplaced.

Therefore, it's possibe that I is at position 4 in the secret? But in Guess 3, when we guessed I at position 4, we got '-', which suggests that there is no I at position 4 in the secret? Or if there is, but it wasn't matched? Actually, if secret has I at position 4, and we guess I at position 4, it should be ✓, not '-', because we have exactly that position.

Therefore, the feedback from Guess 3's I at position 4 is '-', which must mean that in the secret word, there is no I at position 4.

Similarly, Guess 2: '-' for I at position 2 means no I at position 2.
Guess 1: '-' for I at position 3 means no I at position 3.

AND with position 1 occupied by U, then where are the I's? Only possibility is that the word has no I at all? But we have confirmation that I is in the word via Guess 1 '-' which indicates presence? Yes, '-' in feedback means the letter is in the word but not at that position.

So the presence of I is confirmed by Guess 1. Therefore, if not at positions 1,2,3,4, then position 5 is E, fixed? So cannot be.

This implies a logical error, but let's trust the feedback.

Perhaps I must be at position 4 after all? But the feedback from Guess 3 for I at position 4 was '-', which by standard rules means that the secret does not have I at that position (position 4).

So the only remaining explanation is that the word has only one I, and it must be at position 1 or 5, but position 1 is U, position 5 is E, so impossible.

Unless feedback is misinterpreted.

Alternative: in Guess 3 (""UTILE"") → feedback U(✓) T(-) I(-) L(x) E(✓)
Each feedback symbol corresponds to the letter at that position:
- Position 1: U is ✓
- Position 2: T is '-' → so T is in the word, just not at position 2
- Position 3: T? No, position 3 in ""UTILE"" is I (""U-T-I-L-E"") positions:1-U,2-T,3-I,4-L,5-E
But we got I at position 3 with '-'? ""UTILE"" positions:1-U,2-T,3-I,4-L,5-E.

So feedback:
- U(1) = ✓
- T(2) = '-'
- I(3) = '-'
- L(4) = x
- E(5) = ✓

So for position 3: I got '-' which means I is in the word but not at position 3.

But we already knew I is not at position 3 from Guess 1.

And Guess 2 and Guess 3 show I is not at positions 2 and 4.

So again, contradiction.

Unless the feedback for Guess 1 was for ""RAISE"" which had its own positions.

Perhaps the secret word is ""UTILE"" but with I at a different location? But that's not possible because E is at 5.

Or the word might be ""TUILE"" or ""EUIIS"" not possible.

Another possibility: we have U fixed at 1, E fixed at 5, and T present somewhere. For I, given all '-' at many positions, perhaps the secret word has I at position 3 or where not previously guessed? They are all covered.

Therefore, I think the word must be ""UNTIE"" or something similar, and the feedback for I might have been mistaken, or perhaps it's ""UNITE"" by earlier feedback.

But let's consider known information: U at 1, E at 5, T present (position 3 or 4), and I present (somewhere).

Absent letters: R,A,S,B,O,M,L

So we try ""UNTIE"": U-N-T-I-E →  1-U,2-N,3-T,4-I,5-E
Check feedback against previous:
- In Guess 3: when we had ""UTILE"" (position 3: I), we got '-' for I, which would be consistent if secret has I at position 4? In ""UTILE"" we guessed I at position 3, not 4? Positions in ""UTILE"": position 3 is I, position 4 is L.

For ""UNTIE"": secret.
- If secret is ""UNTIE"", then:
  - Guess 1: RAISE → position 3: I should be '-' (since I is at secret's position 4) → consistent.
  - Guess 2: BIOME → position 2: I should be '-' (since I in secret is at 4, not 2) → consistent.
  - Guess 3: UTILE → positions:
     - U: position 1: ✓ (both U)
     - T: position 2: guessed T at 2, secret has T at position 3? So T is in word but not at position 2 → '-' which matches feedback.
     - I: position 3: guessed I at 3, secret has I at position 4? So I is in word but not at position 3 → '-' which matches.
     - L: position 4: guessed L, but secret has I at 4 (not L), so L is not in word → 'x' which matches.
     - E: position 5: ✓
  - Therefore, it fits: the secret word is likely ""UNTIE"".

But ""UNTIE"" has I at position 4, and in Guess 3, we got '-' for I at position 3? That I is not at position 3, so if secret has I at 4, it should not affect the feedback for position 3.

So ""UNTIE"" should feedback for Guess 3 exactly as given.

But previously, I thought Guess 3 was for position 4? No, in ""UTILE"", I was at position 3, not 4.

""UTILE"" breakdown:
- U (pos1)
- T (pos2)
- I (pos3)
- L (pos4)
- E (pos5)

Feedback: I at position 3 got '-', meaning I is not at position 3 in secret? Which is correct if secret has I at position 4.

Also, position 4 in guess is L and got 'x' — OK.

So ""UNTIE"" fits: U-N-T-I-E

Now, the word must confirm if N is present? Not yet tested.

To be safe, we can guess ""UNTIE"".

But how about ""UNITE""? U-N-I-T-E → positions 3: I, position 4: T

In this case:
- I is at position 3.
- But in Guess 1, ""RAISE"" had I at position 3 and got '-' , if secret has I at position 3, we should get ✓, not '-', because it would be correct. So it cannot be ""UNITE"" if I is at position 3.

Therefore, only ""UNTIE"" works so far.

Another word: ""UNTIE"" means to unfasten. Valid.

Other option: ""URITE"" not common.

So I will guess ""UNTIE"".

If incorrect, feedback will give more info.Based on the cumulative feedback and deductions:

### Feedback Summary:
- **Guess 1: RAISE** → R(x) A(x) I(-) S(x) E(✓)  
  → E is fixed at position 5; I is present but not at position 3; R, A, S absent.
- **Guess 2: BIOME** → B(x) I(-) O(x) M(x) E(✓)  
  → E (position 5) confirmed; I present but not at position 2; B, O, M absent.
- **Guess 3: UTILE** → U(✓) T(-) I(-) L(x) E(✓)  
  → U fixed at position 1; E fixed at position 5; T present but not at position 2; I present but not at position 3 or 4; L absent.

### Key Constraints:
- **Secret word**: U _ _ _ E
- **Fixed positions**: 
  - Position 1: U
  - Position 5: E
- **Present letters**: 
  - **T**: Must be at position 3 or 4 (since it's not at position 2).
  - **I**: Present but ruled out from positions 2, 3, and 4 in previous guesses. As position 1 is occupied, the only possibility is that I is at position 4 (since position 3 is reserved for T in a likely word structure).
- **Absent letters**: R, A, S, B, O, M, L (must be avoided).
- New letters introduced: N (common consonant; untested).

### Deduction Process:
- The secret word starts with U, ends with E, and contains T and I.
- Given I is not at positions 2, 3, or 4 (from consecutive misplacements), position 4 must belong to I (the only remaining spot).
- T must then be at position 3 (since it can't be at 2, and position 4 is now I).
- Position 2 must be filled with an untested letter. High-frequency consonants like N are ideal for testing.
- **""UNTIE""** fits perfectly: 
  - U (position 1 ✓), N (untested), T (position 3 ✓), I (position 4 ✓), E (position 5 ✓). 
  - Uses common letters, avoids all absent characters, and confirms T/I placements.

This guess resolves positional conflicts and leverages feedback efficiently. If ""UNTIE"" is incorrect, feedback will clarify N or other letters.",Guess 5: untie -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) N(✓) T(✓) I(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
