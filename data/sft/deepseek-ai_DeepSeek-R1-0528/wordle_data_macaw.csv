We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all fairly common in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the word but not in the first position)
 R: x (R is not in the word at all)
 A: - (A is in the word but not in the third position)
 N: x (N is not in the word)
 E: x (E is not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The word contains C and A, but not in the positions we guessed.
 - The word does not contain R, N, E.

 Since the secret word has 5 letters, and we know C and A are present, but R, N, E are absent.

 Also, note:
 - C was in position 1 of our guess but is not in position 1 in the secret word. So the secret word's first letter is not C.
 - A was in position 3 of our guess but is not in position 3 in the secret word.

 Now, we must make a second guess that:
 1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Contains C and A (since we know they are in the word), but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively? Actually, note:
    - C cannot be in position 1? Actually, the feedback says C is present but not in position 1, so C must be in position 2,3,4, or 5? But we don't know exactly. Similarly, A is present but not in position 3, so A must be in position 1,2,4, or 5.

 However, note that the feedback symbols:
 - For position 1 (C): '-' means the letter C is in the word but not here (so not in position 1).
 - For position 3 (A): '-' means A is in the word but not in position 3.

 Also, we know the word has no R, N, E.

 We should try to keep other letters from previous guess? But we already know N and E are out, so avoid them.

 Also, we have used letters: C, R, A, N, E. We know R, N, E are absent, so we must not use them again.

 Therefore, the new guess should:
 - Include C and A (because they are in the word), but C not in position 1, A not in position 3.
 - Avoid letters: R, N, E.

 We need to pick a word that has C and A, and three new letters to get more information.

 Ideas:
 We know the word must have C and A, so let's think of common words that contain C and A.

 Also, we must avoid the absent letters: R, N, E.

 Possible positions for C: positions 2,3,4,5? But wait, we don't know if it can be repeated? But the feedback for C was one '-' so unless the word has two C's, we don't know. We should assume that the word might have repeated letters? But typically Wordle words don't have duplicates? Actually, they can. However, let's play safe and assume no duplicates unless we have evidence.

 So, C must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, 5? Actually, we only know it's not in position 1. Similarly, A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).

 But we have to assign positions that are not forbidden and include new letters.

 How about trying a word where C is in position 2 and A is in position 1? Or position 4?

 We also want to cover more common letters. Let's avoid using letters we haven't tried yet? Well, we haven't tried many: the alphabet without C,R,A,N,E.

 Let me think of words that have C and A, and without R,N,E.

 Examples:
 - ""CATCH"" -> but has C at the beginning? Position1: C -> but we know the first letter cannot be C. So we cannot put C in first position. So ""CATCH"" starts with C: invalid for our guess? Because we know C is not in position 1? So we must avoid that.

 Let's rearrange: 
 Word: ? ? ? ? ?
 Must have C and A, C not in 1, A not in 3.

 Option: Place A in position 1: ""A??C?"" or something.

 Consider: ""APPLE"" -> but has E? E is out. 
 ""BACON"" -> has B, A, C, O, N -> but N is out? And we cannot use N. 
 ""CHAOS"" -> starts with C? No, can't have C in position 1.

 Let me think of words that have C not in position 1 and A not in position 3:

 Option 1: A in position 1, then C in position 2: e.g., ""ACTOR"" -> but R is out? No, R is not allowed. 
 Option 2: A in position 1, C in position 4: e.g., ""ATTIC"" -> has T repeated? Also, we don't know about T. 

 Alternatively, C in position 2: then the word can be ""?C?A?"" or ""?C??A"" etc.

 Let me try to form: 
 - Without R,N,E, and without C in first, A in third.

 Words that come to mind:
 - ""WACKY"": A in position 2, C in position 3? But we have to avoid: A cannot be in position 3? Wait, in ""WACKY"": 
   W:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, Y:5. 
   So A is in position 2, which is allowed. C is in position 3? Feedback only said C is present and not in position 1. Position 3 is new. But we haven't tested position 3 before? Actually, in the first guess, position 3 was A (which got a '-'), but that doesn't directly say anything about C being in position 3? However, we want to test new positions.

 But note: the feedback doesn't say anything about position 3 for C? So we can put C in position 3.

 But we must not put A in position 3? Correct. In ""WACKY"", A is in position 2 (not 3) and C is in position 3. So this word seems okay? However, we are not sure if C can be in position 3? The feedback for the first guess said A was in position 3 and was not correct, so position 3 is open for C? Yes.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that puts C and A in other positions we haven't tested.

 Another word: ""CLAMP"" -> but C is in position 1? Not allowed.

 Word: ""BACKS"" -> B:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, S:5 -> avoids R,N,E. A is in position 2 (not 3) and C is in position 3? Position 3 was previously A, but now we are putting C? That's fine.

 But note: we haven't tested positions 1,2,4,5? Actually, we tested position 1 (C) and got '-', meaning the real letter in position 1 is not C. We don't know what it is. Similarly, position 2 was R (which was absent) so position 2 is not R, but we don't know the letter. Position 4 was N (absent), position 5 was E (absent). So we can use any letter in positions 1,2,4,5, except the known absent letters.

 ""BACKS"": 
 - Position 1: B -> new letter 
 - Position 2: A -> we know A must be in the word, but not necessarily in position 2? It could be. We don't know yet. 
 - Position 3: C -> we know C is in the word, but the feedback said C is not in position 1, and now we try position 3? 
 - Position 4: K -> new
 - Position 5: S -> new

 However, we must note: The feedback from the first guess does not explicitly forbid C from being in position 3? So we can try.

 But another word: ""MARCH"" -> has R? R is out. 

 Another: ""COAST"" -> but C in first? Not allowed.

 Another: ""SCARF"" -> has R, and also S:1, C:2, A:3 -> but we cannot have A in position 3? Because first guess had A in position 3 and got '-' meaning A is not in that position? So position 3 must not be A. So ""SCARF"" has A in position 3? So disallowed.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" -> but A appears twice? And we have S and T? But note: we don't know about S and T. Also, position 3: S? We don't know. However, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? And C? Where is C? We forgot: we must include C! So without C? We can't because C is in the word.

 So we must have C.

 Therefore, let's go with ""WACKY"" or ""BACKS"". But note: ""WACKY"" is a valid word? Yes. And ""BACKS"" is valid.

 However, we also want to use common words and maximize information? We might want to include letters that are common and haven't been tried yet.

 Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E (and now we are avoiding R,N,E). 
 Letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We are introducing four new letters? Actually, depending on the word.

 For ""WACKY"": letters W, A, C, K, Y -> we know A and C, and W,K,Y are new. So that's three new letters.

 For ""BACKS"": letters B, A, C, K, S -> A and C known, and B,K,S new.

 Both seem reasonable.

 But note: the secret word has five distinct letters? We don't know. But we can proceed.

 Alternatively, we can consider: ""PACKS"" -> P:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, S:5 -> same structure as ""BACKS"" but with P. That is also acceptable.

 Since we don't know the first letter, testing B or P or W gives information.

 I'll go with ""BACKS"" because it's common and avoids obscure words.

 So my second guess: ""BACKS""

 However, wait: we are going to place A in position 2? What if the secret word has A in a different position? For example, if the secret word has A in position 1? Then our guess would have A in position 2 and we might get '-', meaning A is in the word but not there? Then we'd know A is not in 2? But we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, if we put A in a new position we haven't tried? We tried position 3? We can try in position 1? 

 Consider: place A in position 1 and C in position 4? Example: ""ATTIC"" has A in 1 and C in 4? But T repeated? And we get only one T? And also note letters: A, T, T, I, C? But we don't know about T and I? And it has only three distinct letters? Maybe not best for information.

 Another: ""AUDIO"" -> doesn't have C! So must contain C.

 How about ""COATI""? -> but C is at the beginning? Not allowed.

 How about ""HACKS"": H:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, S:5 -> again, A in position2, C in3.

 I think ""BACKS"" is fine.

 So guess: ""backs""

 But wait: we know that the secret word does not have E, R, N? So no problem.

 Final decision: Guess ""BACKS"".

<guess>backs</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- C is in the word but not in position 1  
- R is not in the word  
- A is in the word but not in position 3  
- N is not in the word  
- E is not in the word  

For the second guess:  
- Must include **C** and **A** (known present letters)  
- **C** cannot be in position 1  
- **A** cannot be in position 3  
- **R, N, E** are absent and must not be used  
- Aim to test new letters (B, K, S) in untested positions  

Selected ""BACKS"" because:  
- Positions: B (1), A (2), C (3), K (4), S (5)  
- Places **A** in a new position (2) and **C** in a new position (3), avoiding forbidden positions  
- Introduces three new letters (B, K, S) to gather more information  

<guess>backs</guess>",backs,"We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the word but not in the first position)
 R: x (R is not in the word at all)
 A: - (A is in the word but not in the third position)
 N: x (N is not in the word)
 E: x (E is not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The word contains C and A, but not in the positions we guessed.
 - The word does not contain R, N, E.

 Since the secret word has 5 letters, and we know C and A are present, but R, N, E are absent.

 Also, note:
 - C was in position 1 of our guess but is not in position 1 in the secret word. So the secret word's first letter is not C.
 - A was in position 3 of our guess but is not in position 3 in the secret word.

 Now, we must make a second guess that:
 1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Contains C and A (since we know they are in the word), but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively? Actually, note:

 However, note that the feedback symbols:
 - For position 1 (C): '-' means the letter C is in the word but not here (so not in position 1).
 - For position 3 (A): '-' means A is in the word but not in position 3.

 Also, we know the word has no R, N, E.

 We should try to keep other letters from previous guess? But we already know N and E are out, so avoid them.

 Also, we have used letters: C, R, A, N, E. We know R, N, E are absent, so we must not use them again.

 Therefore, the new guess should:
 - Include C and A (because they are in the word), but C not in position 1, A not in position 3.

 - Position 3: C -> we know C is in the word, but the feedback said C is not in position 1, and now we try position 3? 
 - Position 4: K -> new

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,macaw,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all fairly common in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the word but not in the first position)
 R: x (R is not in the word at all)
 A: - (A is in the word but not in the third position)
 N: x (N is not in the word)
 E: x (E is not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The word contains C and A, but not in the positions we guessed.
 - The word does not contain R, N, E.

 Since the secret word has 5 letters, and we know C and A are present, but R, N, E are absent.

 Also, note:
 - C was in position 1 of our guess but is not in position 1 in the secret word. So the secret word's first letter is not C.
 - A was in position 3 of our guess but is not in position 3 in the secret word.

 Now, we must make a second guess that:
 1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Contains C and A (since we know they are in the word), but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively? Actually, note:
    - C cannot be in position 1? Actually, the feedback says C is present but not in position 1, so C must be in position 2,3,4, or 5? But we don't know exactly. Similarly, A is present but not in position 3, so A must be in position 1,2,4, or 5.

 However, note that the feedback symbols:
 - For position 1 (C): '-' means the letter C is in the word but not here (so not in position 1).
 - For position 3 (A): '-' means A is in the word but not in position 3.

 Also, we know the word has no R, N, E.

 We should try to keep other letters from previous guess? But we already know N and E are out, so avoid them.

 Also, we have used letters: C, R, A, N, E. We know R, N, E are absent, so we must not use them again.

 Therefore, the new guess should:
 - Include C and A (because they are in the word), but C not in position 1, A not in position 3.
 - Avoid letters: R, N, E.

 We need to pick a word that has C and A, and three new letters to get more information.

 Ideas:
 We know the word must have C and A, so let's think of common words that contain C and A.

 Also, we must avoid the absent letters: R, N, E.

 Possible positions for C: positions 2,3,4,5? But wait, we don't know if it can be repeated? But the feedback for C was one '-' so unless the word has two C's, we don't know. We should assume that the word might have repeated letters? But typically Wordle words don't have duplicates? Actually, they can. However, let's play safe and assume no duplicates unless we have evidence.

 So, C must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, 5? Actually, we only know it's not in position 1. Similarly, A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).

 But we have to assign positions that are not forbidden and include new letters.

 How about trying a word where C is in position 2 and A is in position 1? Or position 4?

 We also want to cover more common letters. Let's avoid using letters we haven't tried yet? Well, we haven't tried many: the alphabet without C,R,A,N,E.

 Let me think of words that have C and A, and without R,N,E.

 Examples:
 - ""CATCH"" -> but has C at the beginning? Position1: C -> but we know the first letter cannot be C. So we cannot put C in first position. So ""CATCH"" starts with C: invalid for our guess? Because we know C is not in position 1? So we must avoid that.

 Let's rearrange: 
 Word: ? ? ? ? ?
 Must have C and A, C not in 1, A not in 3.

 Option: Place A in position 1: ""A??C?"" or something.

 Consider: ""APPLE"" -> but has E? E is out. 
 ""BACON"" -> has B, A, C, O, N -> but N is out? And we cannot use N. 
 ""CHAOS"" -> starts with C? No, can't have C in position 1.

 Let me think of words that have C not in position 1 and A not in position 3:

 Option 1: A in position 1, then C in position 2: e.g., ""ACTOR"" -> but R is out? No, R is not allowed. 
 Option 2: A in position 1, C in position 4: e.g., ""ATTIC"" -> has T repeated? Also, we don't know about T. 

 Alternatively, C in position 2: then the word can be ""?C?A?"" or ""?C??A"" etc.

 Let me try to form: 
 - Without R,N,E, and without C in first, A in third.

 Words that come to mind:
 - ""WACKY"": A in position 2, C in position 3? But we have to avoid: A cannot be in position 3? Wait, in ""WACKY"": 
   W:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, Y:5. 
   So A is in position 2, which is allowed. C is in position 3? Feedback only said C is present and not in position 1. Position 3 is new. But we haven't tested position 3 before? Actually, in the first guess, position 3 was A (which got a '-'), but that doesn't directly say anything about C being in position 3? However, we want to test new positions.

 But note: the feedback doesn't say anything about position 3 for C? So we can put C in position 3.

 But we must not put A in position 3? Correct. In ""WACKY"", A is in position 2 (not 3) and C is in position 3. So this word seems okay? However, we are not sure if C can be in position 3? The feedback for the first guess said A was in position 3 and was not correct, so position 3 is open for C? Yes.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that puts C and A in other positions we haven't tested.

 Another word: ""CLAMP"" -> but C is in position 1? Not allowed.

 Word: ""BACKS"" -> B:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, S:5 -> avoids R,N,E. A is in position 2 (not 3) and C is in position 3? Position 3 was previously A, but now we are putting C? That's fine.

 But note: we haven't tested positions 1,2,4,5? Actually, we tested position 1 (C) and got '-', meaning the real letter in position 1 is not C. We don't know what it is. Similarly, position 2 was R (which was absent) so position 2 is not R, but we don't know the letter. Position 4 was N (absent), position 5 was E (absent). So we can use any letter in positions 1,2,4,5, except the known absent letters.

 ""BACKS"": 
 - Position 1: B -> new letter 
 - Position 2: A -> we know A must be in the word, but not necessarily in position 2? It could be. We don't know yet. 
 - Position 3: C -> we know C is in the word, but the feedback said C is not in position 1, and now we try position 3? 
 - Position 4: K -> new
 - Position 5: S -> new

 However, we must note: The feedback from the first guess does not explicitly forbid C from being in position 3? So we can try.

 But another word: ""MARCH"" -> has R? R is out. 

 Another: ""COAST"" -> but C in first? Not allowed.

 Another: ""SCARF"" -> has R, and also S:1, C:2, A:3 -> but we cannot have A in position 3? Because first guess had A in position 3 and got '-' meaning A is not in that position? So position 3 must not be A. So ""SCARF"" has A in position 3? So disallowed.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" -> but A appears twice? And we have S and T? But note: we don't know about S and T. Also, position 3: S? We don't know. However, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? And C? Where is C? We forgot: we must include C! So without C? We can't because C is in the word.

 So we must have C.

 Therefore, let's go with ""WACKY"" or ""BACKS"". But note: ""WACKY"" is a valid word? Yes. And ""BACKS"" is valid.

 However, we also want to use common words and maximize information? We might want to include letters that are common and haven't been tried yet.

 Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E (and now we are avoiding R,N,E). 
 Letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We are introducing four new letters? Actually, depending on the word.

 For ""WACKY"": letters W, A, C, K, Y -> we know A and C, and W,K,Y are new. So that's three new letters.

 For ""BACKS"": letters B, A, C, K, S -> A and C known, and B,K,S new.

 Both seem reasonable.

 But note: the secret word has five distinct letters? We don't know. But we can proceed.

 Alternatively, we can consider: ""PACKS"" -> P:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, S:5 -> same structure as ""BACKS"" but with P. That is also acceptable.

 Since we don't know the first letter, testing B or P or W gives information.

 I'll go with ""BACKS"" because it's common and avoids obscure words.

 So my second guess: ""BACKS""

 However, wait: we are going to place A in position 2? What if the secret word has A in a different position? For example, if the secret word has A in position 1? Then our guess would have A in position 2 and we might get '-', meaning A is in the word but not there? Then we'd know A is not in 2? But we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, if we put A in a new position we haven't tried? We tried position 3? We can try in position 1? 

 Consider: place A in position 1 and C in position 4? Example: ""ATTIC"" has A in 1 and C in 4? But T repeated? And we get only one T? And also note letters: A, T, T, I, C? But we don't know about T and I? And it has only three distinct letters? Maybe not best for information.

 Another: ""AUDIO"" -> doesn't have C! So must contain C.

 How about ""COATI""? -> but C is at the beginning? Not allowed.

 How about ""HACKS"": H:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, S:5 -> again, A in position2, C in3.

 I think ""BACKS"" is fine.

 So guess: ""backs""

 But wait: we know that the secret word does not have E, R, N? So no problem.

 Final decision: Guess ""BACKS"".

<guess>backs</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- C is in the word but not in position 1  
- R is not in the word  
- A is in the word but not in position 3

- E is not in the word

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE

- A: - (in word, not in position 3)
- N: x (not in word)

- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)

So, from this we know:

1. The word has A in position 2 and C in position 3. So the word pattern is: _ A C _ _

2. The word contains C and A, and we now know their exact positions (A at 2, C at 3). Also, we know that the word does not contain: R, N, E, B, K, S.

3. From guess 1, we also know that the word has C (which we now know is at position 3) and A (at position 2), and that the first letter is not C (which we already know because C is at 3) and the third letter is not A (which we now know is at 2, so that's consistent).

4. The absent letters are: R, N, E, B, K, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that has the form _ A C _ _ and does not contain any of the absent letters.

The available letters are: D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use A and C, but they are already placed).

We must fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

Let's think of common words that fit:

- The word must start with a letter that is not in the absent list and end with two letters also not in the absent list.

Common patterns: 
- Words ending with T: e.g., ""FACT"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Possible words:
- ""PACT"" is 4 letters. 
- ""DACHS"" but S is absent.
- ""HACKS"" but we tried and S and K are absent? Actually, in guess 2, we have K and S absent.

Let me list possible words:

- ""TACIT"": T at 1, A at 2, C at 3, I at 4, T at 5. But T is repeated? And we don't know about T. Also, I is available. But let's check: T is not in absent list? Absent: R,N,E,B,K,S. So T is allowed. But ""TACIT"" has T at the end? Yes.

- ""TACIT"": positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:C, 4:I, 5:T. But we have two T's? The word ""tacit"" is valid.

But we have to consider if the word can have repeated letters? The feedback doesn't indicate anything about duplicates, so it's possible.

Another word: ""FACET"" but E is absent? E is in the absent list.

""LACKY"" but K and Y? K is absent, and also we have A and C in place? But ""LACKY"" is not standard, and K is absent.

""MACAW"" but W is available? But ""MACAW"": M at 1, A at 2, C at 3, A at 4, W at 5. But A is repeated? And we don't know if A can be repeated? Also, the fourth letter is A, but we haven't tested that. But the word has A at 2 and 4? That's possible. However, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback from guess 1 only showed one A? But it could have more.

But in guess 1, we had A in position 3 and got '-', meaning A is in the word but not at 3. Now we have A at 2 (correct) and if we put A at 4, that might be possible? But we don't have feedback about that.

However, we are trying to guess, so we can consider.

But let's avoid words with repeated letters for now to maximize information? Or if we have a good candidate, we can use.

Another word: ""PACKY"" but K is absent.

""WACKO"" but K and O? K is absent.

""YACHT"": Y at 1, A at 2, C at 3, H at 4, T at 5. This seems good. Letters: Y, H, T are new and not absent. ""YACHT"" is a valid word.

Also, ""TACIT"" as above.

""FACTO"" but O at 5? And F at 1? But ""FACTO"" is not a word? ""FACTOR"" has 6 letters. ""FACTO"" is not standard.

""PACTS"" but S is absent.

""MACED"" but E and D? E is absent.

""MACHE"" but E absent.

""LACED"" E absent.

So, without E, S, K, etc.

Another: ""HATCH"" but T and H? ""HATCH"": H at 1, A at 2, T at 3? But we need C at 3? So no, because position 3 must be C.

We have fixed A at 2 and C at 3.

So the word must be: [letter] A C [letter] [letter]

Possible words:
- ""TACIT"" (if we allow repeated T? But T is at 1 and 5)
- ""YACHT""
- ""DATCH"" not a word.
- ""FICHU"" not matching pattern.
- ""WACKY"" but K absent.

""YACHT"" seems good: Y, A, C, H, T.

Also, ""TACHE"" but E absent.

""RACED"" but R and E absent.

""PACHA"" but P at 1, A at 2, C at 3, H at 4, A at 5? But A repeated? And we have A at 2 and 5? That's possible. ""PACHA"" is a word? It might be accepted? But let's see.

""MACHE"" E absent.

""LATCH"" L at 1, A at 2, T at 3? But position 3 must be C, so not.

""MATCH"" same issue.

So, with the pattern _ A C _ _, and avoiding absent letters, we have:

- ""YACHT"" (Y, H, T)
- ""TACIT"" (T, I, T) - with repeated T
- ""PACHA"" (P, H, A) - with repeated A? But A is already known, so if we use A again, we might not get new information? But it's a valid word.

But we want to maximize information? So using a word with new letters is better.

""YACHT"" uses Y, H, T which are new.

""TACIT"" uses T and I, but T repeated? So only two new letters? And one repeated.

""PACHA"" uses P, H, and A (repeated) so only two new letters: P and H.

So ""YACHT"" has three new letters: Y, H, T.

Therefore, I think ""YACHT"" is a good guess.

But let's confirm the word: YACHT is a valid 5-letter word.

So, we'll guess ""YACHT"".

But note: in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and got '-', meaning C is in the word but not at 1. Now we have C at 3, which is correct. Similarly, A at 2 is correct.

In ""YACHT"", we have:
- Position 1: Y (new)
- Position 2: A (correct, we know)
- Position 3: C (correct, we know)
- Position 4: H (new)
- Position 5: T (new)

And no absent letters.

So, this should be a valid guess.

Therefore, the third guess is ""YACHT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C is in the word but not position 1, R is absent, A is in the word but not position 3, N is absent, E is absent.
- **Guess 2 (BACKS)**: B is absent, A is correct in position 2, C is correct in position 3, K is absent, S is absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **A in position 2** and **C in position 3**, so the pattern is: `_ A C _ _`.
- **Absent letters (cannot be used)**: B, E, K, N, R, S.
- **Present letters (must be included)**: A and C (already placed correctly).
- **Untried letters**: D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on words matching `_ A C _ _` using only untried letters to maximize new information.
- Prioritize common words with high-frequency letters (e.g., T, H, Y) to test new positions.
- Avoid absent letters and ensure A and C remain fixed in positions 2 and 3.

### Selected Guess: YACHT
- **Why this word?**
  - Fits the pattern: `Y A C H T`.
  - Uses new letters (Y, H, T) to test the unknown positions (1, 4, 5).
  - Contains no absent letters or repeats.
  - ""YACHT"" is a valid English word (meaning a type of boat).
- **Expected information gain**: 
  - Tests Y in position 1, H in position 4, and T in position 5.
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal which of these letters are present/absent and their positions, narrowing down possibilities (e.g., ""TACIT"" or ""PATCH"" if valid).

<guess>yacht</guess>",yacht,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: - (in word, not in position 1)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, not in position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: BACKS
- B: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- C: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- K: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)

So, from this we know:

1. The word has A in position 2 and C in position 3. So the word pattern is: _ A C _ _

2. The word contains C and A, and we now know their exact positions (A at 2, C at 3). Also, we know that the word does not contain: R, N, E, B, K, S.

3. From guess 1, we also know that the word has C (which we now know is at position 3) and A (at position 2), and that the first letter is not C (which we already know because C is at 3) and the third letter is not A (which we now know is at 2, so that's consistent).

4. The absent letters are: R, N, E, B, K, S.

- ""TACIT"": positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:C, 4:I, 5:T. But we have two T's? The word ""tacit"" is valid.

But we have to consider if the word can have repeated letters? The feedback doesn't indicate anything about duplicates, so it's possible.

Another word: ""FACET"" but E is absent? E is in the absent list.

""LACKY"" but K and Y? K is absent, and also we have A and C in place? But ""LACKY"" is not standard, and K is absent.

""MACAW"" but W is available? But ""MACAW"": M at 1, A at 2, C at 3, A at 4, W at 5. But A is repeated? And we don't know if A can be repeated? Also, the fourth letter is A, but we haven't tested that. But the word has A at 2 and 4? That's possible. However, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice?

""YACHT"": Y at 1, A at 2, C at 3, H at 4, T at 5. This seems good. Letters: Y, H, T are new and not absent. ""YACHT"" is a valid word.

Also, ""TACIT"" as above.

""PACTS"" but S is absent.

""MACED"" but E and D? E is absent.

""MACHE"" but E absent.

""LACED"" E absent.

So, without E, S, K, etc.

Another: ""HATCH"" but T and H? ""HATCH"": H at 1, A at 2, T at 3? But we need C at 3? So no, because position 3 must be C.

We have fixed A at 2 and C at 3.

So the word must be: [letter] A C [letter] [letter]

Possible words:
- ""TACIT"" (if we allow repeated T? But T is at 1 and 5)
- ""YACHT""
- ""DATCH"" not a word.
- ""FICHU"" not matching pattern.
- ""WACKY"" but K absent.

""YACHT"" seems good: Y, A, C, H, T.

Also, ""TACHE"" but E absent.

""RACED"" but R and E absent.

""PACHA"" but P at 1, A at 2, C at 3, H at 4, A at 5? But A repeated? And we have A at 2 and 5? That's possible. ""PACHA"" is a word? It might be accepted? But let's see.

""MACHE"" E absent.

""LATCH"" L at 1, A at 2, T at 3? But position 3 must be C, so not.

""MATCH"" same issue.

So, with the pattern _ A C _ _, and avoiding absent letters, we have:

- ""YACHT"" (Y, H, T)
- ""TACIT"" (T, I, T) - with repeated T
- ""PACHA"" (P, H, A) - with repeated A? But A is already known, so if we use A again, we might not get new information? But it's a valid word.

But we want to maximize information? So using a word with new letters is better.

""YACHT"" uses Y, H, T which are new.

""TACIT"" uses T and I, but T repeated? So only two new letters? And one repeated.

""PACHA"" uses P, H, and A (repeated) so only two new letters: P and H.

So ""YACHT"" has three new letters: Y, H, T.

Therefore, I think ""YACHT"" is a good guess.

But let's confirm the word: YACHT is a valid 5-letter word.

So, we'll guess ""YACHT"".

But note: in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and got '-', meaning C is in the word but not at 1. Now we have C at 3, which is correct. Similarly, A at 2 is correct.

In ""YACHT"", we have:
- Position 1: Y (new)
- Position 2: A (correct, we know)
- Position 3: C (correct, we know)
- Position 4: H (new)
- Position 5: T (new)

And no absent letters.

So, this should be a valid guess.

Therefore, the third guess is ""YACHT"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C is in the word but not position 1, R is absent, A is in the word but not position 3, N is absent, E is absent.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,macaw,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are all fairly common in English words.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
 C: - (meaning C is in the word but not in the first position)
 R: x (R is not in the word at all)
 A: - (A is in the word but not in the third position)
 N: x (N is not in the word)
 E: x (E is not in the word)

 Therefore, we know:
 - The word contains C and A, but not in the positions we guessed.
 - The word does not contain R, N, E.

 Since the secret word has 5 letters, and we know C and A are present, but R, N, E are absent.

 Also, note:
 - C was in position 1 of our guess but is not in position 1 in the secret word. So the secret word's first letter is not C.
 - A was in position 3 of our guess but is not in position 3 in the secret word.

 Now, we must make a second guess that:
 1. Is a valid 5-letter English word.
 2. Contains C and A (since we know they are in the word), but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively? Actually, note:
    - C cannot be in position 1? Actually, the feedback says C is present but not in position 1, so C must be in position 2,3,4, or 5? But we don't know exactly. Similarly, A is present but not in position 3, so A must be in position 1,2,4, or 5.

 However, note that the feedback symbols:
 - For position 1 (C): '-' means the letter C is in the word but not here (so not in position 1).
 - For position 3 (A): '-' means A is in the word but not in position 3.

 Also, we know the word has no R, N, E.

 We should try to keep other letters from previous guess? But we already know N and E are out, so avoid them.

 Also, we have used letters: C, R, A, N, E. We know R, N, E are absent, so we must not use them again.

 Therefore, the new guess should:
 - Include C and A (because they are in the word), but C not in position 1, A not in position 3.
 - Avoid letters: R, N, E.

 We need to pick a word that has C and A, and three new letters to get more information.

 Ideas:
 We know the word must have C and A, so let's think of common words that contain C and A.

 Also, we must avoid the absent letters: R, N, E.

 Possible positions for C: positions 2,3,4,5? But wait, we don't know if it can be repeated? But the feedback for C was one '-' so unless the word has two C's, we don't know. We should assume that the word might have repeated letters? But typically Wordle words don't have duplicates? Actually, they can. However, let's play safe and assume no duplicates unless we have evidence.

 So, C must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, 5? Actually, we only know it's not in position 1. Similarly, A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).

 But we have to assign positions that are not forbidden and include new letters.

 How about trying a word where C is in position 2 and A is in position 1? Or position 4?

 We also want to cover more common letters. Let's avoid using letters we haven't tried yet? Well, we haven't tried many: the alphabet without C,R,A,N,E.

 Let me think of words that have C and A, and without R,N,E.

 Examples:
 - ""CATCH"" -> but has C at the beginning? Position1: C -> but we know the first letter cannot be C. So we cannot put C in first position. So ""CATCH"" starts with C: invalid for our guess? Because we know C is not in position 1? So we must avoid that.

 Let's rearrange: 
 Word: ? ? ? ? ?
 Must have C and A, C not in 1, A not in 3.

 Option: Place A in position 1: ""A??C?"" or something.

 Consider: ""APPLE"" -> but has E? E is out. 
 ""BACON"" -> has B, A, C, O, N -> but N is out? And we cannot use N. 
 ""CHAOS"" -> starts with C? No, can't have C in position 1.

 Let me think of words that have C not in position 1 and A not in position 3:

 Option 1: A in position 1, then C in position 2: e.g., ""ACTOR"" -> but R is out? No, R is not allowed. 
 Option 2: A in position 1, C in position 4: e.g., ""ATTIC"" -> has T repeated? Also, we don't know about T. 

 Alternatively, C in position 2: then the word can be ""?C?A?"" or ""?C??A"" etc.

 Let me try to form: 
 - Without R,N,E, and without C in first, A in third.

 Words that come to mind:
 - ""WACKY"": A in position 2, C in position 3? But we have to avoid: A cannot be in position 3? Wait, in ""WACKY"": 
   W:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, Y:5. 
   So A is in position 2, which is allowed. C is in position 3? Feedback only said C is present and not in position 1. Position 3 is new. But we haven't tested position 3 before? Actually, in the first guess, position 3 was A (which got a '-'), but that doesn't directly say anything about C being in position 3? However, we want to test new positions.

 But note: the feedback doesn't say anything about position 3 for C? So we can put C in position 3.

 But we must not put A in position 3? Correct. In ""WACKY"", A is in position 2 (not 3) and C is in position 3. So this word seems okay? However, we are not sure if C can be in position 3? The feedback for the first guess said A was in position 3 and was not correct, so position 3 is open for C? Yes.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that puts C and A in other positions we haven't tested.

 Another word: ""CLAMP"" -> but C is in position 1? Not allowed.

 Word: ""BACKS"" -> B:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, S:5 -> avoids R,N,E. A is in position 2 (not 3) and C is in position 3? Position 3 was previously A, but now we are putting C? That's fine.

 But note: we haven't tested positions 1,2,4,5? Actually, we tested position 1 (C) and got '-', meaning the real letter in position 1 is not C. We don't know what it is. Similarly, position 2 was R (which was absent) so position 2 is not R, but we don't know the letter. Position 4 was N (absent), position 5 was E (absent). So we can use any letter in positions 1,2,4,5, except the known absent letters.

 ""BACKS"": 
 - Position 1: B -> new letter 
 - Position 2: A -> we know A must be in the word, but not necessarily in position 2? It could be. We don't know yet. 
 - Position 3: C -> we know C is in the word, but the feedback said C is not in position 1, and now we try position 3? 
 - Position 4: K -> new
 - Position 5: S -> new

 However, we must note: The feedback from the first guess does not explicitly forbid C from being in position 3? So we can try.

 But another word: ""MARCH"" -> has R? R is out. 

 Another: ""COAST"" -> but C in first? Not allowed.

 Another: ""SCARF"" -> has R, and also S:1, C:2, A:3 -> but we cannot have A in position 3? Because first guess had A in position 3 and got '-' meaning A is not in that position? So position 3 must not be A. So ""SCARF"" has A in position 3? So disallowed.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" -> but A appears twice? And we have S and T? But note: we don't know about S and T. Also, position 3: S? We don't know. However, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? And C? Where is C? We forgot: we must include C! So without C? We can't because C is in the word.

 So we must have C.

 Therefore, let's go with ""WACKY"" or ""BACKS"". But note: ""WACKY"" is a valid word? Yes. And ""BACKS"" is valid.

 However, we also want to use common words and maximize information? We might want to include letters that are common and haven't been tried yet.

 Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E (and now we are avoiding R,N,E). 
 Letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We are introducing four new letters? Actually, depending on the word.

 For ""WACKY"": letters W, A, C, K, Y -> we know A and C, and W,K,Y are new. So that's three new letters.

 For ""BACKS"": letters B, A, C, K, S -> A and C known, and B,K,S new.

 Both seem reasonable.

 But note: the secret word has five distinct letters? We don't know. But we can proceed.

 Alternatively, we can consider: ""PACKS"" -> P:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, S:5 -> same structure as ""BACKS"" but with P. That is also acceptable.

 Since we don't know the first letter, testing B or P or W gives information.

 I'll go with ""BACKS"" because it's common and avoids obscure words.

 So my second guess: ""BACKS""

 However, wait: we are going to place A in position 2? What if the secret word has A in a different position? For example, if the secret word has A in position 1? Then our guess would have A in position 2 and we might get '-', meaning A is in the word but not there? Then we'd know A is not in 2? But we are trying to get information.

 Alternatively, if we put A in a new position we haven't tried? We tried position 3? We can try in position 1? 

 Consider: place A in position 1 and C in position 4? Example: ""ATTIC"" has A in 1 and C in 4? But T repeated? And we get only one T? And also note letters: A, T, T, I, C? But we don't know about T and I? And it has only three distinct letters? Maybe not best for information.

 Another: ""AUDIO"" -> doesn't have C! So must contain C.

 How about ""COATI""? -> but C is at the beginning? Not allowed.

 How about ""HACKS"": H:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, S:5 -> again, A in position2, C in3.

 I think ""BACKS"" is fine.

 So guess: ""backs""

 But wait: we know that the secret word does not have E, R, N? So no problem.

 Final decision: Guess ""BACKS"".

<guess>backs</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  
- C is in the word but not in position 1  
- R is not in the word  
- A is in the word but not in position 3  
- N is not in the word  
- E is not in the word  

For the second guess:  
- Must include **C** and **A** (known present letters)  
- **C** cannot be in position 1  
- **A** cannot be in position 3  
- **R, N, E** are absent and must not be used  
- Aim to test new letters (B, K, S) in untested positions  

Selected ""BACKS"" because:  
- Positions: B (1), A (2), C (3), K (4), S (5)  
- Places **A** in a new position (2) and **C** in a new position (3), avoiding forbidden positions  
- Introduces three new letters (B, K, S) to gather more information

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: backs -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) C(✓) K(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: - (in word, not in position 1)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, not in position 3)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: BACKS
- B: x (not in word)
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- C: ✓ (correct, in position 3)
- K: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)

So, from this we know:

1. The word has A in position 2 and C in position 3. So the word pattern is: _ A C _ _

2. The word contains C and A, and we now know their exact positions (A at 2, C at 3). Also, we know that the word does not contain: R, N, E, B, K, S.

3. From guess 1, we also know that the word has C (which we now know is at position 3) and A (at position 2), and that the first letter is not C (which we already know because C is at 3) and the third letter is not A (which we now know is at 2, so that's consistent).

4. The absent letters are: R, N, E, B, K, S.

We need to find a 5-letter word that has the form _ A C _ _ and does not contain any of the absent letters.

The available letters are: D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use A and C, but they are already placed).

We must fill the first, fourth, and fifth positions.

Let's think of common words that fit:

- The word must start with a letter that is not in the absent list and end with two letters also not in the absent list.

Common patterns: 
- Words ending with T: e.g., ""FACT"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

Possible words:
- ""PACT"" is 4 letters. 
- ""DACHS"" but S is absent.
- ""HACKS"" but we tried and S and K are absent? Actually, in guess 2, we have K and S absent.

Let me list possible words:

- ""TACIT"": T at 1, A at 2, C at 3, I at 4, T at 5. But T is repeated? And we don't know about T. Also, I is available. But let's check: T is not in absent list? Absent: R,N,E,B,K,S. So T is allowed. But ""TACIT"" has T at the end? Yes.

- ""TACIT"": positions: 1:T, 2:A, 3:C, 4:I, 5:T. But we have two T's? The word ""tacit"" is valid.

But we have to consider if the word can have repeated letters? The feedback doesn't indicate anything about duplicates, so it's possible.

Another word: ""FACET"" but E is absent? E is in the absent list.

""LACKY"" but K and Y? K is absent, and also we have A and C in place? But ""LACKY"" is not standard, and K is absent.

""MACAW"" but W is available? But ""MACAW"": M at 1, A at 2, C at 3, A at 4, W at 5. But A is repeated? And we don't know if A can be repeated? Also, the fourth letter is A, but we haven't tested that. But the word has A at 2 and 4? That's possible. However, we know A is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice? The feedback from guess 1 only showed one A? But it could have more.

But in guess 1, we had A in position 3 and got '-', meaning A is in the word but not at 3. Now we have A at 2 (correct) and if we put A at 4, that might be possible? But we don't have feedback about that.

However, we are trying to guess, so we can consider.

But let's avoid words with repeated letters for now to maximize information? Or if we have a good candidate, we can use.

Another word: ""PACKY"" but K is absent.

""WACKO"" but K and O? K is absent.

""YACHT"": Y at 1, A at 2, C at 3, H at 4, T at 5. This seems good. Letters: Y, H, T are new and not absent. ""YACHT"" is a valid word.

Also, ""TACIT"" as above.

""FACTO"" but O at 5? And F at 1? But ""FACTO"" is not a word? ""FACTOR"" has 6 letters. ""FACTO"" is not standard.

""PACTS"" but S is absent.

""MACED"" but E and D? E is absent.

""MACHE"" but E absent.

""LACED"" E absent.

So, without E, S, K, etc.

Another: ""HATCH"" but T and H? ""HATCH"": H at 1, A at 2, T at 3? But we need C at 3? So no, because position 3 must be C.

We have fixed A at 2 and C at 3.

So the word must be: [letter] A C [letter] [letter]

Possible words:
- ""TACIT"" (if we allow repeated T? But T is at 1 and 5)
- ""YACHT""
- ""DATCH"" not a word.
- ""FICHU"" not matching pattern.
- ""WACKY"" but K absent.

""YACHT"" seems good: Y, A, C, H, T.

Also, ""TACHE"" but E absent.

""RACED"" but R and E absent.

""PACHA"" but P at 1, A at 2, C at 3, H at 4, A at 5? But A repeated? And we have A at 2 and 5? That's possible. ""PACHA"" is a word? It might be accepted? But let's see.

""MACHE"" E absent.

""LATCH"" L at 1, A at 2, T at 3? But position 3 must be C, so not.

""MATCH"" same issue.

So, with the pattern _ A C _ _, and avoiding absent letters, we have:

- ""YACHT"" (Y, H, T)
- ""TACIT"" (T, I, T) - with repeated T
- ""PACHA"" (P, H, A) - with repeated A? But A is already known, so if we use A again, we might not get new information? But it's a valid word.

But we want to maximize information? So using a word with new letters is better.

""YACHT"" uses Y, H, T which are new.

""TACIT"" uses T and I, but T repeated? So only two new letters? And one repeated.

""PACHA"" uses P, H, and A (repeated) so only two new letters: P and H.

So ""YACHT"" has three new letters: Y, H, T.

Therefore, I think ""YACHT"" is a good guess.

But let's confirm the word: YACHT is a valid 5-letter word.

So, we'll guess ""YACHT"".

But note: in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and got '-', meaning C is in the word but not at 1. Now we have C at 3, which is correct. Similarly, A at 2 is correct.

In ""YACHT"", we have:
- Position 1: Y (new)
- Position 2: A (correct, we know)
- Position 3: C (correct, we know)
- Position 4: H (new)
- Position 5: T (new)

And no absent letters.

So, this should be a valid guess.

Therefore, the third guess is ""YACHT"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C is in the word but not position 1, R is absent, A is in the word but not position 3, N is absent, E is absent.
- **Guess 2 (BACKS)**: B is absent, A is correct in position 2, C is correct in position 3, K is absent, S is absent.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has **A in position 2** and **C in position 3**, so the pattern is: `_ A C _ _`.
- **Absent letters (cannot be used)**: B, E, K, N, R, S.
- **Present letters (must be included)**: A and C (already placed correctly).
- **Untried letters**: D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on words matching `_ A C _ _` using only untried letters to maximize new information.
- Prioritize common words with high-frequency letters (e.g., T, H, Y) to test new positions.
- Avoid absent letters and ensure A and C remain fixed in positions 2 and 3.

### Selected Guess: YACHT
- **Why this word?**
  - Fits the pattern: `Y A C H T`.
  - Uses new letters (Y, H, T) to test the unknown positions (1, 4, 5).
  - Contains no absent letters or repeats.
  - ""YACHT"" is a valid English word (meaning a type of boat).
- **Expected information gain**: 
  - Tests Y in position 1, H in position 4, and T in position 5.
  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal which of these letters are present/absent and their positions, narrowing down possibilities (e.g., ""TACIT"" or ""PATCH"" if valid).

Is a valid 5-letter English word.\n 2. Contains C and A (since we know they are in the word), but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively? Actually, note:\n    - C cannot be in position 1? Actually, the feedback says C is present but not in position 1, so C must be in position 2,3,4, or 5? But we don\'t know exactly. Similarly, A is present but not in position 3, so A must be in position 1,2,4, or 5.\n\n However, note that the feedback symbols:\n - For position 1 (C): \'-\' means the letter C is in the word but not here (so not in position 1).\n - For position 3 (A): \'-\' means A is in the word but not in position 3.\n\n Also, we know the word has no R, N, E.\n\n We should try to keep other letters from previous guess? But we already know N and E are out, so avoid them.\n\n Also, we have used letters: C, R, A, N, E.

But wait, we don\'t know if it can be repeated? But the feedback for C was one \'-\' so unless the word has two C\'s, we don\'t know. We should assume that the word might have repeated letters? But typically Wordle words don\'t have duplicates? Actually, they can. However, let\'s play safe and assume no duplicates unless we have evidence.\n\n So, C must be in one of positions 2, 3, 4, 5? Actually, we only know it\'s not in position 1. Similarly, A must be in one of positions 1,2,4,5 (not 3).\n\n But we have to assign positions that are not forbidden and include new letters.\n\n How about trying a word where C is in position 2 and A is in position 1? Or position 4?\n\n We also want to cover more common letters. Let\'s avoid using letters we haven\'t tried yet? Well, we haven\'t tried many: the alphabet without C,R,A,N,E.\n\n Let me think of words that have C and A, and without R,N,E.\n\n Examples:\n - ""CATCH"" -> but has C at the beginning? Position1: C -> but we know the first letter cannot be C. So we cannot put C in first position. So ""CATCH"" starts with C: invalid for our guess? Because we know C is not in position 1? So we must avoid that.\n\n Let\'s rearrange: \n Word: ? ? ? ? ?\n Must have C and A, C not in 1, A not in 3.\n\n Option: Place A in position 1: ""A??C?"" or something.\n\n Consider: ""APPLE"" -> but has E? E is out. \n ""BACON"" -> has B, A, C, O, N -> but N is out? And we cannot use N. \n ""CHAOS"" -> starts with C? No, can\'t have C in position 1.\n\n Let me think of words that have C not in position 1 and A not in position 3:\n\n Option 1: A in position 1, then C in position 2: e.g., ""ACTOR"" -> but R is out? No, R is not allowed. \n Option 2: A in position 1, C in position 4: e.g., ""ATTIC"" -> has T repeated? Also, we don\'t know about T. \n\n Alternatively, C in position 2: then the word can be ""?C?A?"" or ""?C??A"" etc.\n\n Let me try to form: \n - Without R,N,E, and without C in first, A in third.\n\n Words that come to mind:\n - ""WACKY"": A in position 2, C in position 3? But we have to avoid: A cannot be in position 3? Wait, in ""WACKY"": \n   W:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, Y:5. \n   So A is in position 2, which is allowed. C is in position 3? Feedback only said C is present and not in position 1. Position 3 is new. But we haven\'t tested position 3 before? Actually, in the first guess, position 3 was A (which got a \'-\'), but that doesn\'t directly say anything about C being in position 3? However, we want to test new positions.\n\n But note: the feedback doesn\'t say anything about position 3 for C? So we can put C in position 3.\n\n But we must not put A in position 3? Correct. In ""WACKY"", A is in position 2 (not 3) and C is in position 3. So this word seems okay? However, we are not sure if C can be in position 3? The feedback for the first guess said A was in position 3 and was not correct, so position 3 is open for C? Yes.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that puts C and A in other positions we haven\'t tested.\n\n Another word: ""CLAMP"" -> but C is in position 1? Not allowed.\n\n Word: ""BACKS"" -> B:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, S:5 -> avoids R,N,E. A is in position 2 (not 3) and C is in position 3? Position 3 was previously A, but now we are putting C? That\'s fine.\n\n But note: we haven\'t tested positions 1,2,4,5? Actually, we tested position 1 (C) and got \'-\', meaning the real letter in position 1 is not C. We don\'t know what it is. Similarly, position 2 was R (which was absent) so position 2 is not R, but we don\'t know the letter. Position 4 was N (absent), position 5 was E (absent). So we can use any letter in positions 1,2,4,5, except the known absent letters.\n\n ""BACKS"": \n - Position 1: B -> new letter \n - Position 2: A -> we know A must be in the word, but not necessarily in position 2? It could be. We don\'t know yet. \n - Position 3: C -> we know C is in the word, but the feedback said C is not in position 1, and now we try position 3? \n - Position 4: K -> new\n - Position 5: S -> new\n\n However, we must note: The feedback from the first guess does not explicitly forbid C from being in position 3? So we can try.\n\n But another word: ""MARCH"" -> has R? R is out. \n\n Another: ""COAST"" -> but C in first? Not allowed.\n\n Another: ""SCARF"" -> has R, and also S:1, C:2, A:3 -> but we cannot have A in position 3? Because first guess had A in position 3 and got \'-\' meaning A is not in that position? So position 3 must not be A. So ""SCARF"" has A in position 3? So disallowed.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PASTA"" -> but A appears twice? And we have S and T? But note: we don\'t know about S and T. Also, position 3: S? We don\'t know. However, ""PASTA"" has A in position 2 and 5? And C? Where is C? We forgot: we must include C! So without C? We can\'t because C is in the word.\n\n So we must have C.\n\n Therefore, let\'s go with ""WACKY"" or ""BACKS"". But note: ""WACKY"" is a valid word? Yes. And ""BACKS"" is valid.\n\n However, we also want to use common words and maximize information? We might want to include letters that are common and haven\'t been tried yet.\n\n Letters tried so far: C, R, A, N, E (and now we are avoiding R,N,E). \n Letters available: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n We are introducing four new letters? Actually, depending on the word.\n\n For ""WACKY"": letters W, A, C, K, Y -> we know A and C, and W,K,Y are new. So that\'s three new letters.\n\n For ""BACKS"": letters B, A, C, K, S -> A and C known, and B,K,S new.\n\n Both seem reasonable.\n\n But note: the secret word has five distinct letters? We don\'t know. But we can proceed.\n\n Alternatively, we can consider: ""PACKS"" -> P:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, S:5 -> same structure as ""BACKS"" but with P. That is also acceptable.\n\n Since we don\'t know the first letter, testing B or P or W gives information.\n\n I\'ll go with ""BACKS"" because it\'s common and avoids obscure words.\n\n So my second guess: ""BACKS""\n\n However, wait: we are going to place A in position 2? What if the secret word has A in a different position? For example, if the secret word has A in position 1? Then our guess would have A in position 2 and we might get \'-\', meaning A is in the word but not there? Then we\'d know A is not in 2? But we are trying to get information.\n\n Alternatively, if we put A in a new position we haven\'t tried? We tried position 3? We can try in position 1? \n\n Consider: place A in position 1 and C in position 4? Example: ""ATTIC"" has A in 1 and C in 4? But T repeated? And we get only one T? And also note letters: A, T, T, I, C? But we don\'t know about T and I? And it has only three distinct letters? Maybe not best for information.\n\n Another: ""AUDIO"" -> doesn\'t have C! So must contain C.\n\n How about ""COATI""? -> but C is at the beginning? Not allowed.\n\n How about ""HACKS"": H:1, A:2, C:3, K:4, S:5 -> again, A in position2, C in3.\n\n I think ""BACKS"" is fine.\n\n So guess: ""backs""\n\n But wait: we know that the secret word does not have E, R, N? So no problem.\n\n Final decision: Guess ""BACKS"".\n\n<guess>backs</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":  \n- C is in the word but not in position 1  \n- R is not in the word  \n- A is in the word but not in position 3  \n- N is not in the word  \n- E is not in the word  \n\nFor the second guess:  \n- Must include **C** and **A** (known present letters)  \n- **C** cannot be in position 1  \n- **A** cannot be in position 3  \n- **R, N, E** are absent and must not be used  \n- Aim to test new letters (B, K, S) in untested positions  \n\nSelected ""BACKS"" because:  \n- Positions: B (1), A (2), C (3), K (4), S (5)  \n- Places **A** in a new position (2) and **C** in a new position (3), avoiding forbidden positions  \n- Introduces three new letters (B, K, S) to gather more information\n\n<guess>backs</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: backs -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) C(✓) K(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: - (in word, not in position 1)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: - (in word, not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: BACKS\n- B: x (not in word)\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)\n- C: ✓ (correct, in position 3)\n- K: x (not in word)\n- S: x (not in word)\n\nSo, from this we know:\n\n1.

Letters: Y, H, T are new and not absent. ""YACHT"" is a valid word.\n\nAlso, ""TACIT"" as above.\n\n""FACTO"" but O at 5? And F at 1? But ""FACTO"" is not a word? ""FACTOR"" has 6 letters. ""FACTO"" is not standard.\n\n""PACTS"" but S is absent.\n\n""MACED"" but E and D? E is absent.\n\n""MACHE"" but E absent.\n\n""LACED"" E absent.\n\nSo, without E, S, K, etc.\n\nAnother: ""HATCH"" but T and H? ""HATCH"": H at 1, A at 2, T at 3? But we need C at 3? So no, because position 3 must be C.\n\nWe have fixed A at 2 and C at 3.\n\nSo the word must be: [letter] A C [letter] [letter]\n\nPossible words:\n- ""TACIT"" (if we allow repeated T? But T is at 1 and 5)\n- ""YACHT""\n- ""DATCH"" not a word.\n- ""FICHU"" not matching pattern.\n- ""WACKY"" but K absent.\n\n""YACHT"" seems good: Y, A, C, H, T.\n\nAlso, ""TACHE"" but E absent.\n\n""RACED"" but R and E absent.\n\n""PACHA"" but P at 1, A at 2, C at 3, H at 4, A at 5? But A repeated? And we have A at 2 and 5? That\'s possible. ""PACHA"" is a word? It might be accepted? But let\'s see.\n\n""MACHE"" E absent.\n\n""LATCH"" L at 1, A at 2, T at 3? But position 3 must be C, so not.\n\n""MATCH"" same issue.\n\nSo, with the pattern _ A C _ _, and avoiding absent letters, we have:\n\n- ""YACHT"" (Y, H, T)\n- ""TACIT"" (T, I, T) - with repeated T\n- ""PACHA"" (P, H, A) - with repeated A? But A is already known, so if we use A again, we might not get new information? But it\'s a valid word.\n\nBut we want to maximize information? So using a word with new letters is better.\n\n""YACHT"" uses Y, H, T which are new.\n\n""TACIT"" uses T and I, but T repeated? So only two new letters? And one repeated.\n\n""PACHA"" uses P, H, and A (repeated) so only two new letters: P and H.\n\nSo ""YACHT"" has three new letters: Y, H, T.\n\nTherefore, I think ""YACHT"" is a good guess.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the word: YACHT is a valid 5-letter word.\n\nSo, we\'ll guess ""YACHT"".\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had C in position 1 and got \'-\', meaning C is in the word but not at 1. Now we have C at 3, which is correct. Similarly, A at 2 is correct.\n\nIn ""YACHT"", we have:\n- Position 1: Y (new)\n- Position 2: A (correct, we know)\n- Position 3: C (correct, we know)\n- Position 4: H (new)\n- Position 5: T (new)\n\nAnd no absent letters.\n\nSo, this should be a valid guess.\n\nTherefore, the third guess is ""YACHT"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C is in the word but not position 1, R is absent, A is in the word but not position 3, N is absent, E is absent.\n- **Guess 2 (BACKS)**: B is absent, A is correct in position 2, C is correct in position 3, K is absent, S is absent.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has **A in position 2** and **C in position 3**, so the pattern is: `_ A C _ _`.\n- **Absent letters (cannot be used)**: B, E, K, N, R, S.\n- **Present letters (must be included)**: A and C (already placed correctly).\n- **Untried letters**: D, F, G, H, I, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Focus on words matching `_ A C _ _` using only untried letters to maximize new information.\n- Prioritize common words with high-frequency letters (e.g., T, H, Y) to test new positions.\n- Avoid absent letters and ensure A and C remain fixed in positions 2 and 3.\n\n### Selected Guess: YACHT\n- **Why this word?**\n  - Fits the pattern: `Y A C H T`.\n  - Uses new letters (Y, H, T) to test the unknown positions (1, 4, 5).\n  - Contains no absent letters or repeats.\n  - ""YACHT"" is a valid English word (meaning a type of boat).\n- **Expected information gain**: \n  - Tests Y in position 1, H in position 4, and T in position 5.\n  - If incorrect, feedback will reveal which of these letters are present/absent and their positions, narrowing down possibilities (e.g., ""TACIT"" or ""PATCH"" if valid).\n\n<guess>yacht</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(-) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: backs -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) C(✓) K(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: yacht -> FEEDBACK: Y(x) A(✓) C(✓) H(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning: C is in the word but not in position 1; R, N, E are absent; A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: BACKS -> B(x), A(✓), C(✓), K(x), S(x)
Meaning: B, K, S are absent; A is in position 2; C is in position 3. So the word has A in the 2nd position and C in the 3rd position: _ A C _ _

Guess 3: YACHT -> Y(x), A(✓), C(✓), H(x), T(x)
Meaning: Y, H, T are absent; A in position 2 and C in position 3 confirmed again.

Summary of known information:

- Pattern: _ A C _ _
- Correctly placed: A at position 2, C at position 3.
- Absent letters: B, E, K, N, R, S, Y, H, T (from feedback of all guesses)
- Also absent: any letter from previous guesses that were marked absent.

Letters tried and absent: B, E, H, K, N, R, S, T, Y.

Thus, available letters: D, F, G, I, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z, and also we have A and C but they are fixed.

We need to form a 5-letter word of the pattern _ A C _ _

The first blank (position 1) and the last two blanks (positions 4 and 5) must be filled with the remaining letters from the available set.

Possible letters for these positions: D, F, G, I, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

We have not tried any of these letters yet.

Now, we need to find a valid English word that fits:

Position 1: one of D, F, G, I, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z
Position 2: A (fixed)
Position 3: C (fixed)
Position 4 and 5: two letters from the available set.

Let's think of common words that fit ""_ A C _ _"" with the available letters.

Possible words:

- FACT? But that's 4 letters. We need 5.
- Fancied? Too long.

It’s challenging. Let's list possible words:

- ""PAC? A"" - but positions 4 and 5?
- ""LACK"" too short.

Perhaps words like:

- ""MACAW"" but W is available? But MACAW: M A C A W -> positions: M at 1, A at 2, C at 3, A at 4, W at 5. But A repeats? Available, though. However, we haven't tried M or W? They are available. But let me check: M is available, W is available? But we have to avoid absent letters: W is not absent, so it's okay. And MACAW is a valid word (a type of bird). But note: in our pattern, position 4 would be A? But A is already known to be in position 2, and could be repeated? The feedback in guess 3: YACHT had A at position 2 correct, but didn't say anything about other A's? We only had one A in that guess. So repetition is possible.

But MACAW has A at position 4? That would be new.

However, position 1: M, position 4: A, position 5: W.

But we haven't tested A in other positions? We only know that A is not in position 3 (from guess 1). Position 4 is new.

But MACAW uses W? And W is available? However, we have not tried W? Yes.

But MACAW: letters M, A, C, A, W. We know A and C, so new letters M and W? Yes, except that A is repeated? But we are allowed.

Another word: ""PACED"" but E is absent? E is listed absent? From guess 1 E is absent, so we cannot use E.

""PAC? without E?

""PACKS"" but K and S absent? Not allowed.

Another possibility: ""FAC? H"" but H is absent from guess 3? Yes, H is absent.

How about ""LACED"" E absent.

""RACK? R absent.

Perhaps we consider:

- ""DAC? words: DACHS? But S absent and H absent? S absent and H absent? H and S are both absent? From guess 2 and 3? S absent in guess 2, H absent in guess 3. So not allowed.

""MACHE"" E absent.

""VATIC"" but V at 1, A at 2, C at 3? Then T at 4? But T is absent? From guess 3 T is absent? Yes.

T is absent? So cannot use T.

We must avoid T? Since feedback says T(x).

In fact, absent letters include T.

So we must not use T.

Similarly, Y, H too? Yes.

So let me list absent letters: B, E, H, K, N, R, S, T, Y.

Therefore, available: C and A are already placed, plus: D, F, G, I, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z.

Now, we need to form a word: position 1: one from above, positions 4 and 5: two from above.

Possible options:

- ""MAC? W"" -> but we need a letter for position 4? MACAW is the only one I know? But MACAW uses A at 4? Which is acceptable? Or, what about ""MACED"" E absent? Not allowed.

- ""FACT? ""FAC U P"" not a word?

We might be missing words. Let's think:

- ""PAC? ""PACED"" E absent? Bad.

- ""LAC? ""LACEY"" but E absent and Y absent.

Unless we use V? ""VAC? VACU?"" ""VAC UU"" not a word? ""VACUUM"" is 6 letters.

- Use G? ""GAC? ""GACKS"" not a word? And K,S absent? ""GAC H"" H absent? Not.

- ""MACHO"" but H is absent? And O? M A C H O -> H is absent, so no.

""OACI? "" O A C I?"" ""OACIS"" S absent? Or IOAC something? Not likely.

Perhaps: ""PACO"" is 4 letters? ""P A C O"" is 4, we need 5 letters.

We might be stuck. Let's consider that the word may have repeated letters? We haven't tried C elsewhere? Or A? But A could appear elsewhere?

Another idea: ""CACTI"" -> but C at position 1? Position 1 must not be C? From guess 1 C(-). So position 1 cannot be C? Also, ""CACTI"" has C at 1? Not allowed. If it were ""A C C something"" but that's not the pattern.

Pattern: _ A C _ _

So position 1 can be one of the available, position 4 and 5 available letters.

Let's try ""FAQIR"" ? But Q is available? But ""FAQIR"" F A Q I R? R absent? R is absent? From guess 1 R absent? Yes, so no.

""FAVOR"" V and O? But O, F,A,V,O,R? R absent? So if we avoid R? ""FAVOR"" has R at the end? So R is present? But R is absent? Cannot.

Perhaps ""DAVIT"" but T absent? And V? D A V I T? T absent? Not allowed.

""LAVIC"" not a word? ""CALIC"" not matching pattern.

Another possibility: ""P A C K S"" K absent S absent.

I am struggling. Let me think of common words with A C in positions 2 and 3.

Examples:

- ""TACK? TACK"" T absent? Not.

- ""VACUO"" not a word.

- ""FACED"" E absent.

- ""PACHA"" I mentioned earlier? P A C H A -> H is absent? From guess 3 H absent? Yes.

H absent? So PACHA has H? Not allowed.

Alternatively, ""M A C A W"" but MACAW: M A C A W? Positions: M at 1, A at 2, C at 3, A at 4, W at 5? What about the H in PACHA? No, MACAW.

Does MACAW have H? No? MACAW is spelled M-A-C-A-W. No H? So H is not used? And available letters: M and W? They are not absent? Also, A at position 4? Which we haven’t tested? But the feedback only says A is in the word but not position 3? Which is true? A is at positions 2 and 4? Possible? And the word MACAW is valid? Yes, a type of parrot.

So we can try MACAW? It uses M and W? Which are available.

But wait, position 4 is A? Position 5 is W? W is available.

Another word: ""PAC? A P A C A S"" but S absent? Or ""PACAD"" not a word.

""O A C A N"" O A C A N? But N absent? N absent? From guess 1? Yes.

So MACAW: M is available, A at 4, W available? And A is already known to be present? Repetition is possible? So yes.

Is there any other word? For example, ""WACK?"" W is available? But K absent? Not.

""FACTS"" S and T absent? Not.

""P A C O S"" S absent? O and S? S absent? Not.

So, perhaps MACAW? But let me check if there are better candidates.

Another word: ""V A C U U"" not a word? ""VACUUM"" is too long.

"" L A C U N A"" too long.

"" L A C K E Y"" K and E not allowed.

So MACAW seems a candidate.

But what about ""P A C E R"" R absent? E absent? Not.

"" D A C E I"" E absent? Not.

So I think MACAW is a valid guess.

However, we know that the word contains C? Already placed? And in MACAW, we have C at 3? And A at 2? Also, it has M at 1, W at 5? New letters? Yes.

And we haven't tried M or W? So we get information? Yes.

If not MACAW, another possibility? ""WA?C?"" but pattern must be ? A C ? ?

""WAACS"" but S absent? And A repeated? WAACS is not standard? W A A C S? S absent? Not.

Perhaps ""BAILS"" B absent? Etc.

So let's go with MACAW.

I recall another word: ""MANIC"" but N absent? And I at 4? M A N I C? Pattern is fixed A at 2 C at 3? If ""MANIC"" has position 1: M, position 2: A, position 3: N? But our pattern requires position 3 to be C? So it would not match? Our word must have C at position 3? So ""MANIC"" doesn't have C at position 3? So invalid for the pattern? Our pattern is _ A C _ _ so position 3 must be C.

Therefore, ""MAC? something"" only.

Another word: ""FACIE"" or ""FACET"" E absent? Not.

So I think MACAW is the best choice.

Therefore, we'll guess ""MACAW"".

But wait, let's verify:  
MACAW:  
- Position 1: M  
- Position 2: A (correct)  
- Position 3: C (correct)  
- Position 4: A  
- Position 5: W  

And no absent letters? We have not been told that M or W or A repetition is an issue? So we can try.

Although repetition might not be ideal for getting new letter information, it is a valid option.

If not, perhaps ""PACU?"" ""PACU"" is 4 letters? ""P A C U S"" S absent? Not.

So I think MACAW is acceptable.

Therefore, fourth guess: MACAW.
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

**1. Analyze Previous Feedback:**
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - C(-): C is in the word but not in position 1.
  - R(x): R is absent.
  - A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - N(x): N is absent.
  - E(x): E is absent.
- **Guess 2 (BACKS)**:
  - B(x): B is absent.
  - A(✓): A is correct and in position 2.
  - C(✓): C is correct and in position 3.
  - K(x): K is absent.
  - S(x): S is absent.
- **Guess 3 (YACHT)**:
  - Y(x): Y is absent.
  - A(✓): A is confirmed in position 2 (no new info).
  - C(✓): C is confirmed in position 3 (no new info).
  - H(x): H is absent.
  - T(x): T is absent.

**2. Current Knowledge:**
- **Fixed Positions**:
  - Position 2 is A (from Guess 2 and 3).
  - Position 3 is C (from Guess 2 and 3).
- **Absent Letters**: B, E, H, K, N, R, S, T, Y (all letters marked ""x"" across guesses).
- **Present Letters (but position uncertain)**:
  - C is confirmed in position 3 (no other C feedback needed).
  - A is confirmed in position 2 (but may appear elsewhere? Feedback doesn't rule it out).
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word must be `_ A C _ _` (e.g., first, fourth, and fifth positions unknown).
- **Untried Available Letters**: D, F, G, I, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (letters not tested and not absent).

**3. Constraints for New Guess:**
- Must avoid all absent letters (B, E, H, K, N, R, S, T, Y).
- Must retain A in position 2 and C in position 3.
- First, fourth, and fifth positions must use only untried available letters (D, F, G, I, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z).
- Since A and C are confirmed, repetitions of A or C are possible but not tested yet (e.g., A might appear again in position 4 or 5).

**4. Brainstorm Valid Words:**
- Need English words matching `_ A C _ _` using available letters.
- Examples considered:
  - **MACAW**: Valid (pattern: M A C A W). Uses M (position 1), A (position 4—repeated), W (position 5). All letters are untried.
  - Other possibilities like PACHA or TACIT were rejected due to absent letters (H or T) or invalidity.
- **Why MACAW?**
  - Tests three new letters: M (position 1), A's potential repetition (position 4), and W (position 5).
  - Maximizes information gain: If incorrect, feedback reveals M/W presence/absence and tests A duplication.
  - It fits all constraints: No absent letters used, valid English word (a type of parrot).

**5. Decision:**
- This is the fourth guess, so prioritize words that test new letters while respecting known positions. MACAW covers highest-frequency letters from the available set.

<guess>macaw</guess>",macaw,"We are given feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE -> C(-), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(x)
Meaning: C is in the word but not in position 1; R, N, E are absent; A is in the word but not in position 3.

Guess 2: BACKS -> B(x), A(✓), C(✓), K(x), S(x)
Meaning: B, K, S are absent; A is in position 2; C is in position 3. So the word has A in the 2nd position and C in the 3rd position: _ A C _ _

Guess 3: YACHT -> Y(x), A(✓), C(✓), H(x), T(x)
Meaning: Y, H, T are absent; A in position 2 and C in position 3 confirmed again.

Summary of known information:

- Pattern: _ A C _ _
- Correctly placed: A at position 2, C at position 3.
- Absent letters: B, E, K, N, R, S, Y, H, T (from feedback of all guesses)
- Also absent: any letter from previous guesses that were marked absent.

Letters tried and absent: B, E, H, K, N, R, S, T, Y.

Thus, available letters: D, F, G, I, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z, and also we have A and C but they are fixed.

Now, we need to form a word: position 1: one from above, positions 4 and 5: two from above.

Possible options:

- ""MAC? W"" -> but we need a letter for position 4? MACAW is the only one I know? But MACAW uses A at 4? Which is acceptable? Or, what about ""MACED"" E absent? Not allowed.

- ""MACHO"" but H is absent? And O? M A C H O -> H is absent, so no.

""OACI? "" O A C I?"" ""OACIS"" S absent? Or IOAC something? Not likely.

Perhaps: ""PACO"" is 4 letters? ""P A C O"" is 4, we need 5 letters.

We might be stuck. Let's consider that the word may have repeated letters? We haven't tried C elsewhere? Or A? But A could appear elsewhere?

Another idea: ""CACTI"" -> but C at position 1? Position 1 must not be C? From guess 1 C(-). So position 1 cannot be C? Also, ""CACTI"" has C at 1? Not allowed. If it were ""A C C something"" but that's not the pattern.

So position 1 can be one of the available, position 4 and 5 available letters.

Let's try ""FAQIR"" ? But Q is available? But ""FAQIR"" F A Q I R? R absent? R is absent? From guess 1 R absent? Yes, so no.

""FAVOR"" V and O? But O, F,A,V,O,R? R absent? So if we avoid R? ""FAVOR"" has R at the end? So R is present? But R is absent? Cannot.

Perhaps ""DAVIT"" but T absent? And V? D A V I T? T absent? Not allowed.

""LAVIC"" not a word? ""CALIC"" not matching pattern.

Another possibility: ""P A C K S"" K absent S absent.

I am struggling. Let me think of common words with A C in positions 2 and 3.

Examples:

- ""TACK? TACK"" T absent? Not.

- ""VACUO"" not a word.

- ""FACED"" E absent.

- ""PACHA"" I mentioned earlier? P A C H A -> H is absent? From guess 3 H absent? Yes.

Perhaps ""BAILS"" B absent? Etc.

So let's go with MACAW.

I recall another word: ""MANIC"" but N absent? And I at 4? M A N I C? Pattern is fixed A at 2 C at 3? If ""MANIC"" has position 1: M, position 2: A, position 3: N? But our pattern requires position 3 to be C? So it would not match? Our word must have C at position 3? So ""MANIC"" doesn't have C at position 3? So invalid for the pattern? Our pattern is _ A C _ _ so position 3 must be C.

Therefore, ""MAC? something"" only.

Another word: ""FACIE"" or ""FACET"" E absent? Not.

So I think MACAW is the best choice.

Therefore, we'll guess ""MACAW"".

But wait, let's verify:  
MACAW:  
- Position 1: M  
- Position 2: A (correct)  
- Position 3: C (correct)  
- Position 4: A  
- Position 5: W  

And no absent letters? We have not been told that M or W or A repetition is an issue? So we can try.

Although repetition might not be ideal for getting new letter information, it is a valid option.

If not, perhaps ""PACU?"" ""PACU"" is 4 letters? ""P A C U S"" S absent? Not.

So I think MACAW is acceptable.

Therefore, fourth guess: MACAW.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

**1. Analyze Previous Feedback:**
- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: 
  - C(-): C is in the word but not in position 1.
  - R(x): R is absent.
  - A(-): A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - N(x): N is absent.
  - E(x): E is absent.
- **Guess 2 (BACKS)**:
  - B(x): B is absent.
  - A(✓): A is correct and in position 2.
  - C(✓): C is correct and in position 3.
  - K(x): K is absent.
  - S(x): S is absent.
- **Guess 3 (YACHT)**:
  - Y(x): Y is absent.
  - A(✓): A is confirmed in position 2 (no new info).
  - C(✓): C is confirmed in position 3 (no new info).
  - H(x): H is absent.
  - T(x): T is absent.

**2. Current Knowledge:**
- **Fixed Positions**:
  - Position 2 is A (from Guess 2 and 3).
  - Position 3 is C (from Guess 2 and 3).
- **Absent Letters**: B, E, H, K, N, R, S, T, Y (all letters marked ""x"" across guesses).
- **Present Letters (but position uncertain)**:
  - C is confirmed in position 3 (no other C feedback needed).
  - A is confirmed in position 2 (but may appear elsewhere? Feedback doesn't rule it out).
- **Word Pattern**: The secret word must be `_ A C _ _` (e.g., first, fourth, and fifth positions unknown).
- **Untried Available Letters**: D, F, G, I, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z (letters not tested and not absent).

**3. Constraints for New Guess:**
- Must avoid all absent letters (B, E, H, K, N, R, S, T, Y).
- Must retain A in position 2 and C in position 3.
- First, fourth, and fifth positions must use only untried available letters (D, F, G, I, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z).
- Since A and C are confirmed, repetitions of A or C are possible but not tested yet (e.g., A might appear again in position 4 or 5).

**4. Brainstorm Valid Words:**
- Need English words matching `_ A C _ _` using available letters.
- Examples considered:
  - **MACAW**: Valid (pattern: M A C A W). Uses M (position 1), A (position 4—repeated), W (position 5). All letters are untried.
  - Other possibilities like PACHA or TACIT were rejected due to absent letters (H or T) or invalidity.
- **Why MACAW?**
  - Tests three new letters: M (position 1), A's potential repetition (position 4), and W (position 5).
  - Maximizes information gain: If incorrect, feedback reveals M/W presence/absence and tests A duplication.
  - It fits all constraints: No absent letters used, valid English word (a type of parrot).

**5. Decision:**
- This is the fourth guess, so prioritize words that test new letters while respecting known positions. MACAW covers highest-frequency letters from the available set.",Guess 4: macaw -> FEEDBACK: M(✓) A(✓) C(✓) A(✓) W(✓),SUCCESS
