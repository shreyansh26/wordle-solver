We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
Feedback interpretation:
  - C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (x)
  - N is in the word and in the correct position (✓). Specifically, N is the 4th letter.

Therefore, we know:
  - The secret word has the letter 'N' in the 4th position.
  - The letters C, R, A, E are absent from the word entirely.

Since it's the second guess, we must choose a word that:
  - Contains 'N' in the 4th position.
  - Does not contain C, R, A, E (because they are marked as not present).
  - Should introduce new letters to get more information.

We also note that the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.

Considering the constraints:
  - 4th letter is N: pattern: _ _ _ N _

We must avoid using C, R, A, E anywhere.

Let's think of common letters to try. Since we have eliminated some vowels (A and E), we might want to try other vowels or common consonants.

Possible vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.
Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try a word that includes some of these.

One good candidate might be a word that has multiple common letters we haven't tried yet. For example, starting with 'S' and including 'T', 'O', etc.

But note: we must not include C, R, A, E.

Example words with N in 4th position:
  - ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> 4th letter is N. Let's check letters: P, O, I, N, T. None of these are C,R,A,E? Correct.
  - ""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> similar.
  - ""MOUNT"": M-O-U-N-T -> but we don't know about U.

However, we have already used the letter O? No, in the first guess we didn't use O. Actually, in ""crane"", we had C,R,A,N,E. So O is new.

But we want as much new information as possible. We also haven't tried S, T, etc.

Another idea: Since the 4th letter is fixed as N, we can try to vary the other positions.

We might try ""POINT"" or maybe ""STINT"" but that has T twice? We don't want duplicate letters necessarily unless it might be.

Wait, but in feedback from the first guess, we only know that the word has N in the 4th position and doesn't have C,R,A,E. We don't know if duplicates could exist, but usually we avoid duplicates in the first few guesses to maximize information.

But note: the feedback didn't indicate any duplicate in the first guess because the non-N letters were all absent. So duplicates are still possible.

But for now, let's pick a word without duplicates that covers new letters.

One classic approach is to use another set of common letters. Since we don't have a lot of information, let's pick a word that uses letters that frequently appear.

Consider: S, T, O, P, etc.

Possible words:
  - ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> positions: P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4, T at 5.
    This would test P, O, I, T (N is already known). 

But note: we have to ensure that the word doesn't contain forbidden letters. 
  - P: new, O: new, I: new, T: new -> all allowed.

Alternatively, ""STOMP"": S-T-O-M-P -> but then N is missing? We must have N at the 4th position. So that won't work.

So only words with N as the 4th letter.

Similarly, ""BOUND"": B-O-U-N-D -> has U and D? But U is less common.

How about ""JOINS""? But that's J at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4, S at 5. Then S would be at the end.

But ""JOINS"" is a word? Actually, ""JOIN"" is a verb and ""JOINS"" is the third person singular, but it's 5 letters? Wait, ""JOINS"" is 5 letters: J-O-I-N-S. So that would work.

But we have the feedback for the first word showed that N is in the 4th position and we have a correct position. So in the next word, we keep N at the 4th position.

Let me list some words with the pattern: [first letter] [second letter] [third letter] N [fifth letter]

We avoid C, R, A, E.

Common words:
  - POINT: P, O, I, N, T
  - JOINT: J, O, I, N, T
  - MOUNT: M, O, U, N, T
  - FOUNT: F, O, U, N, T
  - COUNT: but C is used? No, C is disallowed -> so COUNT is invalid.
  - JOINS: J, O, I, N, S -> valid? Yes.

Another common one: ""MINTS"" -> M-I-N-T-S? But wait, in MINTS, the N is the third letter? We need the 4th letter to be N. So MINTS is M-I-N-T-S -> here N is at position 3, not 4. So invalid.

We need the 4th letter to be N.

""BLOWN"": B-L-O-W-N -> positions: B1, L2, O3, W4? No, W is at 4 and then N at 5 -> so that has N at the 5th, not 4th. Wrong.

Another one: ""STUNG"": S-T-U-N-G -> S1, T2, U3, N4, G5 -> that works. Letters: S,T,U,N,G -> none of C,R,A,E.

But U is a less common vowel? Perhaps.

Another: ""SWING"": S-W-I-N-G -> but N is at 4? Positions: S1, W2, I3, N4, G5 -> yes. Letters: S,W,I,N,G -> allowed.

But S is common. We haven't tried S.

We can also try ""POINT"", which covers P,O,I,N,T.

I think ""POINT"" is a strong candidate because:
  - It uses new vowels (O and I) and consonants (P and T).
  - It doesn't repeat any known bad letters.

Alternatively, we might consider words that use letters that are very common. According to English letter frequency, T, O, I are common.

So I will go with ""POINT"".

But note: we only know that N is at position 4. We don't know whether O or I might appear in the word at all. But we are testing multiple positions.

Other options: ""JOINT"" or ""MOIST"" but wait, ""MOIST"" has N? No, MOIST is M-O-I-S-T -> no N. So invalid because we must have N at position 4.

Therefore, only words that have N fixed at position 4.

So let me confirm: ""POINT"" is valid.

So we'll guess ""POINT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (x)
- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓)

For the second guess, I need:
- A 5-letter word containing 'N' as the 4th letter
- No C, R, A, or E anywhere
- New letters to maximize information, avoiding the eliminated letters

I considered words like ""point,"" ""joint,"" and ""mount."" ""Point"" was chosen because:
- It fits the pattern (_ _ _ N _) with 'P' (1st), 'O' (2nd), 'I' (3rd), 'N' (4th), and 'T' (5th)
- Uses new common vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T) to test positions

Another common one: ""MINTS"" -> M-I-N-T-S? But wait, in MINTS, the N is the third letter? We need the 4th letter to be N. So MINTS is M-I-N-T-S -> here N is at position 3, not 4. So invalid.

We need the 4th letter to be N.

""BLOWN"": B-L-O-W-N -> positions: B1, L2, O3, W4? No, W is at 4 and then N at 5 -> so that has N at the 5th, not 4th. Wrong.

Another one: ""STUNG"": S-T-U-N-G -> S1, T2, U3, N4, G5 -> that works. Letters: S,T,U,N,G -> none of C,R,A,E.

But U is a less common vowel? Perhaps.

Another: ""SWING"": S-W-I-N-G -> but N is at 4? Positions: S1, W2, I3, N4, G5 -> yes. Letters: S,W,I,N,G -> allowed.

But S is common. We haven't tried S.

We can also try ""POINT"", which covers P,O,I,N,T.

I think ""POINT"" is a strong candidate because:
  - It uses new vowels (O and I) and consonants (P and T).
  - It doesn't repeat any known bad letters.

Alternatively, we might consider words that use letters that are very common. According to English letter frequency, T, O, I are common.

So I will go with ""POINT"".

But note: we only know that N is at position 4. We don't know whether O or I might appear in the word at all. But we are testing multiple positions.

Other options: ""JOINT"" or ""MOIST"" but wait, ""MOIST"" has N? No, MOIST is M-O-I-S-T -> no N. So invalid because we must have N at position 4.

Therefore, only words that have N fixed at position 4.

So let me confirm: ""POINT"" is valid.

So we'll guess ""POINT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all (x)
- N is in the word and in the correct 4th position (✓)

For the second guess, I need:
- A 5-letter word containing 'N' as the 4th letter
- No C, R, A, or E anywhere
- New letters to maximize information, avoiding the eliminated letters

I considered words like ""point,"" ""joint,"" and ""mount."" ""Point"" was chosen because:
- It fits the pattern (_ _ _ N _) with 'P' (1st), 'O' (2nd), 'I' (3rd), 'N' (4th), and 'T' (5th)
- Uses new common vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T) to test positions
- Avoids duplicates and excluded letters

Specifically, N is the 4th letter.\n\nTherefore, we know:\n  - The secret word has the letter \'N\' in the 4th position.\n  - The letters C, R, A, E are absent from the word entirely.\n\nSince it\'s the second guess, we must choose a word that:\n  - Contains \'N\' in the 4th position.\n  - Does not contain C, R, A, E (because they are marked as not present).\n  - Should introduce new letters to get more information.\n\nWe also note that the word must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nConsidering the constraints:\n  - 4th letter is N: pattern: _ _ _ N _\n\nWe must avoid using C, R, A, E anywhere.\n\nLet\'s think of common letters to try. Since we have eliminated some vowels (A and E), we might want to try other vowels or common consonants.\n\nPossible vowels: I, O, U, and sometimes Y.\nCommon consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe can try a word that includes some of these.\n\nOne good candidate might be a word that has multiple common letters we haven\'t tried yet. For example, starting with \'S\' and including \'T\', \'O\', etc.\n\nBut note: we must not include C, R, A, E.\n\nExample words with N in 4th position:\n  - ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> 4th letter is N. Let\'s check letters: P, O, I, N, T. None of these are C,R,A,E? Correct.\n  - ""JOINT"": J-O-I-N-T -> similar.\n  - ""MOUNT"": M-O-U-N-T -> but we don\'t know about U.\n\nHowever, we have already used the letter O? No, in the first guess we didn\'t use O. Actually, in ""crane"", we had C,R,A,N,E. So O is new.\n\nBut we want as much new information as possible. We also haven\'t tried S, T, etc.\n\nAnother idea: Since the 4th letter is fixed as N, we can try to vary the other positions.\n\nWe might try ""POINT"" or maybe ""STINT"" but that has T twice? We don\'t want duplicate letters necessarily unless it might be.\n\nWait, but in feedback from the first guess, we only know that the word has N in the 4th position and doesn\'t have C,R,A,E. We don\'t know if duplicates could exist, but usually we avoid duplicates in the first few guesses to maximize information.\n\nBut note: the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicate in the first guess because the non-N letters were all absent. So duplicates are still possible.\n\nBut for now, let\'s pick a word without duplicates that covers new letters.\n\nOne classic approach is to use another set of common letters. Since we don\'t have a lot of information, let\'s pick a word that uses letters that frequently appear.\n\nConsider: S, T, O, P, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n  - ""POINT"": P-O-I-N-T -> positions: P at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4, T at 5.\n    This would test P, O, I, T (N is already known). \n\nBut note: we have to ensure that the word doesn\'t contain forbidden letters. \n  - P: new, O: new, I: new, T: new -> all allowed.\n\nAlternatively, ""STOMP"": S-T-O-M-P -> but then N is missing? We must have N at the 4th position. So that won\'t work.\n\nSo only words with N as the 4th letter.\n\nSimilarly, ""BOUND"": B-O-U-N-D -> has U and D? But U is less common.\n\nHow about ""JOINS""? But that\'s J at 1, O at 2, I at 3, N at 4, S at 5. Then S would be at the end.\n\nBut ""JOINS"" is a word? Actually, ""JOIN"" is a verb and ""JOINS"" is the third person singular, but it\'s 5 letters? Wait, ""JOINS"" is 5 letters: J-O-I-N-S. So that would work.\n\nBut we have the feedback for the first word showed that N is in the 4th position and we have a correct position. So in the next word, we keep N at the 4th position.\n\nLet me list some words with the pattern: [first letter] [second letter] [third letter] N [fifth letter]\n\nWe avoid C, R, A, E.\n\nCommon words:\n  - POINT: P, O, I, N, T\n  - JOINT: J, O, I, N, T\n  - MOUNT: M, O, U, N, T\n  - FOUNT: F, O, U, N, T\n  - COUNT: but C is used? No, C is disallowed -> so COUNT is invalid.\n  - JOINS: J, O, I, N, S -> valid? Yes.\n\nAnother common one: ""MINTS"" -> M-I-N-T-S? But wait, in MINTS, the N is the third letter? We need the 4th letter to be N. So MINTS is M-I-N-T-S -> here N is at position 3, not 4. So invalid.\n\nWe need the 4th letter to be N.\n\n""BLOWN"": B-L-O-W-N -> positions: B1, L2, O3, W4? No, W is at 4 and then N at 5 -> so that has N at the 5th, not 4th. Wrong.\n\nAnother one: ""STUNG"": S-T-U-N-G -> S1, T2, U3, N4, G5 -> that works. Letters: S,T,U,N,G -> none of C,R,A,E.\n\nBut U is a less common vowel? Perhaps.\n\nAnother: ""SWING"": S-W-I-N-G -> but N is at 4? Positions: S1, W2, I3, N4, G5 -> yes. Letters: S,W,I,N,G -> allowed.\n\nBut S is common.

We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)

- C, R, A, E are not in the word at all.
- N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter).

Guess 2: ""point"" -> Feedback: P(x) O(✓) I(✓) N(✓) T(✓)

- P is not in the word (x).
- O is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter) -> So the 2nd letter is O.
- I is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter) -> So the 3rd letter is I.
- N is confirmed again in the correct position (4th letter).
- T is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter) -> So the 5th letter is T.

Therefore, we know the secret word has the following pattern: _ O I N T

We have fixed letters: 
- 2nd: O
- 3rd: I
- 4th: N
- 5th: T

We only need to find the first letter.

We also know the following letters are NOT in the word: C, R, A, E, P (from the feedback).

Additionally, from guess1 we eliminated C, R, A, E, and from guess2 we eliminated P.

We need to think of a letter that can be the first letter, making a common 5-letter English word ending with ""OINT"". The word is _OINT.

Possible words: 
- joint: J is a possibility? But we don't know yet.
- foist: but that doesn't end with 'NT'. We need ""OINT"".
Actually, the word must be ?OINT.

Common words with this pattern: 
- joint (J)
- point (but we already tried point and P is eliminated? In guess2, P was given as x, so not in the word)
- mound: not ending with INT? No.
- count: but C is eliminated.
- mount: M-O-U-N-T? But wait, here the 3rd letter is U, not I. It doesn't match because we have I as 3rd fixed.
- faint: not OINT.
- saint: but doesn't start with OINT pattern? No.

So the pattern is: first letter, then ""OINT"". We need a word of the form XOINT.

What letters can we put at the beginning? 
- We know C,R,A,E,P are not in the word. Since P is eliminated, point is out.
- Other possibilities? 
  - joint: J-O-I-N-T -> J at start.
  - hoist: but that is H-O-I-S-T, not ending in NT? Actually, ""hoist"" has S at the end, not T. So no.
  - moist: M-O-I-S-T -> not ending in N T? We have N at 4th and T at 5th? In moist, N is missing?
  - As per pattern, we must have O at 2nd, I at 3rd, N at 4th, T at 5th.

Therefore, the only common word that fits is ""joint"". Are there others?
- We can consider ""doint"" but that isn't a common word? Probably not valid.
- ""loint"" – rare.
- ""moint"" – not common.
- ""woint"" – obsolete.

Other possibilities:
- Flint: but F-L-I-N-T -> the letter at position 2 is L, not O. So doesn't match.

Therefore, the secret word must be ""joint"".

But we haven't tested J? And we don't have feedback on J.

From the feedback, we know the word is _OINT, and we have eliminated C,R,A,E,P.

Therefore, the possible candidates are:
- joint (J)
- but are there others? For example, ""foint"" isn't a word. Or ""hoint""? I don't believe it's common. So joint is the main option.

Another possibility: ""oint"" is not a word by itself, so it must have a prefix.

Common words: 
- joint, point – but point is eliminated because P is not in the word (from guess2: P(x)).
We need to confirm if there are other words.

We can also consider: 
- ""joist""? But that is J-O-I-S-T -> then N is missing? We have N fixed at 4th, so ""joist"" has S at 4th and T at 5th? No, positions: J1,O2,I3,S4,T5 -> but we need N at 4th? So wrong.

So the word must exactly have: O at 2nd, I at 3rd, N at 4th, T at 5th.

Therefore, the first letter must be J, because ""joint"" is the only common word left.

But let me double-check: could the word be ""oint"" with a different first letter? 
For instance:
- ""joint"" – valid
- ""point"" – invalid (P eliminated)

Other rare words:
- ""doint"" – obscure, meaning to do something (rare), but not commonly used.
- ""loint"" – to pluck, rare.
In standard Wordle, words are common English words.

Moreover, we have six guesses, but if joint is the only common word, we can guess it.

Alternatively, to be safe, we could try to confirm by testing the J? But we cannot test J separately without using a word that fits the pattern and has J.

But note: our goal is to guess the word correctly. Since ""joint"" fits all the known information and the eliminated letters, it is the logical guess.

If we guess ""joint"" and it turns out to be wrong? Then we would know, but given the constraints, it should be correct.

But let's see: we have the word: ? O I N T

The known bad letters: C,R,A,E,P

Therefore, J is the most likely candidate, and joint is a common word.

We could also consider if there are other letters that form words? Like ""boint""? Unlikely. Or ""qoint"" – no.

Another: ""goint"" – not a word.

Therefore, I will guess ""joint"".

But note: we haven't used or tested letters like B,D,F,G,H,K,L,M,Q,S,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

However, since we already know four positions and only the first is unknown, and given the eliminated letters, ""joint"" is the remaining common word.

So, the guess should be ""joint"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: N is in the word and correct (4th position). C, R, A, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (""point"")**: O, I, N, T are correct and in the right positions (2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th letters respectively). P is absent.

### Deductions:
- The secret word must match the pattern `_ O I N T`, as positions 2–5 are confirmed.
- The first letter must be a valid English letter that forms a common 5-letter word.
- Eliminated letters (cannot appear): C, R, A, E, P (from feedback).

### Analysis:
- Possible words fitting `XOINT`:
  - **""joint""** (J is the only common candidate).
- Rare/obscure words like ""doint"", ""loint"", ""moint"", etc., are unlikely in standard Wordle.
- Since ""point"" (with P) is eliminated, ""joint"" (with J) becomes the only feasible common word matching the pattern and avoiding eliminated letters.
