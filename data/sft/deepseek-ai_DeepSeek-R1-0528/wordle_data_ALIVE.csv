We are starting the game. We need to make our first guess. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet. We should pick a word that maximizes the information we can get, meaning it should include common letters and have a good distribution of vowels and consonants.

Common starting words in Wordle often include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. because they contain common letters and multiple vowels.

Let me think: 
- We want to cover common vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y is not as common).
- Also, common consonants: R, S, T, N, L, etc.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"". It has the vowels A and E, and the consonants C, R, N which are common.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

But note: the feedback symbols will tell us:
- Correct position (✓)
- Present but wrong position (-)
- Absent (x)

So we want to get as much coverage as possible.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a solid starting word.

Therefore, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, from this feedback:
- The letter E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (since we guessed it in the 3rd and it's marked as present but wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- The word does not contain C, R, or N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (to use the known correct letter in the same position).
- Includes the letter A in a position that is not 3 (and also not 5, because that's E).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N.
- We can also try to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for A: since it's not in position 3, it could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We also know that the word has A and E (so far).

Let's think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

We can try to use a word that has A in a different position and also tests other common letters.

For example, we can try to put A in position 1: words like ""AXXXE"", but we need to avoid C, R, N.

Or position 2: ""XAXXE"", or position 4: ""XXXAE"".

Let me list some possibilities:

- Position 1: A? e.g., ""A? ? ? E""
- Position 2: ?A? ? E
- Position 4: ? ? ? A E

We also want to test other common consonants to get more information.

One common strategy is to use a word that includes letters we haven't tried and that are common.

Let me think of words ending with E that contain A and avoid C, R, N.

Some options:

- ""SLATE"": but we have to avoid R? Actually, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E. It doesn't have C, R, N. But we already know E is in position 5, so that's good. Also, A is in position 3? Wait, in ""SLATE"": S (1), L (2), A (3), T (4), E (5). But our feedback for the first guess said A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we use ""SLATE"", we are putting A in position 3 again, which we know is incorrect. So that would be a waste because we already know A is not in position 3.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

So, we need a word with A in position 1, 2, or 4.

Let me try to find words with A in position 1 and ending with E: e.g., ""A? ? ? E""

Examples: ""ABUSE"", but B and U? We haven't tried B or U. But we also want to test more common letters.

""ABASE"": A, B, A, S, E? Wait, that's two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have to avoid R? ""ABASE"" has A, B, A, S, E. It avoids C, R, N. But it has two A's? Actually, the word is A-B-A-S-E. So A in position 1 and 3. But we know A is not in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, it would be marked as absent? Or if the word has two A's, it might be different? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. In the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one A in the word, but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, it would be marked as wrong again (if the word has only one A) or if there is another A, it might be correct? But we don't know. To avoid confusion, it's better to put A in a new position.

So, for the second guess, we should put A in either position 1, 2, or 4.

Let me think of words with A in position 1: e.g., ""A? ? ? E""

- ""ABATE"": A, B, A, T, E -> but two A's? And we avoid C, R, N. But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, B and T are new.

- ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> again two A's.

- ""ADAGE"": A, D, A, G, E -> two A's.

- ""ALATE"": A, L, A, T, E -> two A's? Actually, ""ALATE"" is a word? I think it's not common. But let's stick to common words.

Perhaps we should avoid words with two A's for now to keep it simple.

What about A in position 2: ""?A? ? E""

- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> avoids C, R, N. And A is in position 2.

- ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> but S and T are common.

- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E -> two T's? But that's okay.

- ""WASTE"": W, A, S, T, E.

- ""MASTE"" is not a word.

""SAUTE"" is a word, meaning to fry quickly.

But let's consider: we also want to test other common letters. We haven't tried S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

Another idea: put A in position 4: ""? ? ? A E""

- ""OPALE"": O, P, A, L, E? But that's 5 letters? O-P-A-L-E. But ""OPALE"" is not common; the common word is ""OPAL"" but that's 4 letters. Actually, ""OPALE"" might not be valid.

- ""SCALE"": but C is in it? We have to avoid C. ""SCALE"" has C, which we know is not in the word.

- ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> avoids C, R, N. And A is in position 4? S(1), T(2), A(3)? Wait, no: S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). So A is in position 3 again? We must avoid position 3 for A.

So for position 4: the fourth letter is A and fifth is E, so the word pattern is ? ? ? A E.

Examples: 
- ""PULSE"": P, U, L, S, E -> no A.
- ""PHASE"": P, H, A, S, E -> A is in position 3? H(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). So A is in position 3 again? We need A in position 4? Wait, in ""PHASE"": positions: 1-P, 2-H, 3-A, 4-S, 5-E. So A is in 3, not 4.

To have A in position 4: the word must be ? ? ? A E, meaning the fourth letter is A and fifth is E.

Examples: 
- ""PRAISE"" is 6 letters.
- ""GRACE"" has R and C, which are not allowed.
- ""PLACE"" has C and L? L is allowed, but C is not.

Actually, it's hard to find common words with A in position 4 and E in position 5.

Let me think: 
- ""SUAVE"": S, U, A, V, E -> positions: 1-S, 2-U, 3-A, 4-V, 5-E. So A is in position 3? Not 4.

- ""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E -> A in position 3.

- ""SPADE"": S, P, A, D, E -> A in position 3.

- ""STADE"": S, T, A, D, E -> A in position 3.

It seems that in most 5-letter words ending with E, the A is often in position 1, 2, or 3. Position 4 is rare because the last two letters are A and E? But that would be like ...AE, which is not common.

For example, ""IDEAE"" is not a word. ""CAUSE"" has A in position 3? C(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) — wait, A is in position 2.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with A in position 4 and E in position 5. So maybe we should avoid that.

Therefore, let's focus on A in position 1 or 2.

Position 1: A _ _ _ E

Common words: 
- ""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> avoids C, R, N. And we test B, U, S.
- ""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E -> similar.
- ""AGREE"": A, G, R, E, E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word).
- ""ALONE"": A, L, O, N, E -> but N is not allowed.

So ""ABUSE"" and ""AMUSE"" are options.

Position 2: _ A _ _ E

- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E
- ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E
- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E
- ""WASTE"": W, A, S, T, E
- ""BASTE"": B, A, S, T, E
- ""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E

All these avoid C, R, N.

We also want to maximize information by including new common letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

In the position 1 words, we have ""ABUSE"" (tests A, B, U, S, E) and ""AMUSE"" (A, M, U, S, E).

In position 2, we have several with S and T, which are very common.

Since we know E is fixed at the end, and A is somewhere else, we can choose a word that tests S and T.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had A in position 3, so we know it's not there. Now we can test A in position 2, for example.

I think ""SAUTE"" is a good candidate: it has S, A, U, T, E. We test S, U, T, and A in position 2.

But ""PASTE"" is also good: P, A, S, T, E.

Similarly, ""WASTE"" is common.

However, we must ensure that the word is valid.

Another idea: we can use a word that has the letter A and also other vowels to test? But we know E is in, and A is in, so we might not need to test more vowels? But we don't know about others.

But we have limited tries, so we should focus on consonants.

I think ""PASTE"" is a good choice: it has common letters P, A, S, T, E. And A is in position 2, which is a new position.

So let's go with ""PASTE"".

But note: we are avoiding C, R, N, which we are.

So second guess: ""PASTE""

We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

Therefore, the guess is ""paste"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked as x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as -).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, marked as ✓).

Key insights:
- The secret word ends with E.
- A is present but not in position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- The word does not contain C, R, or N.

For the second guess, I chose ""paste"" because:
- It ends with E (leveraging the known correct position).
- It places A in position 2 (a new position to test, since position 3 is invalid).
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, N).
- It introduces new common consonants (P, S, T) to gather more information.

For example, ""IDEAE"" is not a word. ""CAUSE"" has A in position 3? C(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) — wait, A is in position 2.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with A in position 4 and E in position 5. So maybe we should avoid that.

Therefore, let's focus on A in position 1 or 2.

Position 1: A _ _ _ E

Common words: 
- ""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> avoids C, R, N. And we test B, U, S.
- ""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E -> similar.
- ""AGREE"": A, G, R, E, E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word).
- ""ALONE"": A, L, O, N, E -> but N is not allowed.

So ""ABUSE"" and ""AMUSE"" are options.

Position 2: _ A _ _ E

- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E
- ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E
- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E
- ""WASTE"": W, A, S, T, E
- ""BASTE"": B, A, S, T, E
- ""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E

All these avoid C, R, N.

We also want to maximize information by including new common letters.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.

In the position 1 words, we have ""ABUSE"" (tests A, B, U, S, E) and ""AMUSE"" (A, M, U, S, E).

In position 2, we have several with S and T, which are very common.

Since we know E is fixed at the end, and A is somewhere else, we can choose a word that tests S and T.

Also, note that in the first guess, we had A in position 3, so we know it's not there. Now we can test A in position 2, for example.

I think ""SAUTE"" is a good candidate: it has S, A, U, T, E. We test S, U, T, and A in position 2.

But ""PASTE"" is also good: P, A, S, T, E.

Similarly, ""WASTE"" is common.

However, we must ensure that the word is valid.

Another idea: we can use a word that has the letter A and also other vowels to test? But we know E is in, and A is in, so we might not need to test more vowels? But we don't know about others.

But we have limited tries, so we should focus on consonants.

I think ""PASTE"" is a good choice: it has common letters P, A, S, T, E. And A is in position 2, which is a new position.

So let's go with ""PASTE"".

But note: we are avoiding C, R, N, which we are.

So second guess: ""PASTE""

We'll see the feedback and then adjust.

Therefore, the guess is ""paste"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked as x).
- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as -).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, marked as ✓).

Key insights:
- The secret word ends with E.
- A is present but not in position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- The word does not contain C, R, or N.

For the second guess, I chose ""paste"" because:
- It ends with E (leveraging the known correct position).
- It places A in position 2 (a new position to test, since position 3 is invalid).
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, N).
- It introduces new common consonants (P, S, T) to gather more information.",Guess 2: paste -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) S(x) T(x) E(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,ALIVE,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We need to make our first guess. Since it's the first guess, we don't have any feedback yet. We should pick a word that maximizes the information we can get, meaning it should include common letters and have a good distribution of vowels and consonants.

Common starting words in Wordle often include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. because they contain common letters and multiple vowels.

Let me think: 
- We want to cover common vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y is not as common).
- Also, common consonants: R, S, T, N, L, etc.

One popular starting word is ""CRANE"". It has the vowels A and E, and the consonants C, R, N which are common.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

But note: the feedback symbols will tell us:
- Correct position (✓)
- Present but wrong position (-)
- Absent (x)

So we want to get as much coverage as possible.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's a solid starting word.

Therefore, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position)

So, from this feedback:
- The letter E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the 3rd position (since we guessed it in the 3rd and it's marked as present but wrong position).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

Therefore, we know:
- The word ends with E (position 5).
- The word contains the letter A, but not in position 3.
- The word does not contain C, R, or N.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (to use the known correct letter in the same position).
- Includes the letter A in a position that is not 3 (and also not 5, because that's E).
- Avoids the letters C, R, N.
- We can also try to include other common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for A: since it's not in position 3, it could be in position 1, 2, or 4.

We also know that the word has A and E (so far).

Let's think of words that end with E and contain A, and avoid C, R, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, etc.

We can try to use a word that has A in a different position and also tests other common letters.

For example, we can try to put A in position 1: words like ""AXXXE"", but we need to avoid C, R, N.

Or position 2: ""XAXXE"", or position 4: ""XXXAE"".

Let me list some possibilities:

- Position 1: A? e.g., ""A? ? ? E""
- Position 2: ?A? ? E
- Position 4: ? ? ? A E

We also want to test other common consonants to get more information.

One common strategy is to use a word that includes letters we haven't tried and that are common.

Let me think of words ending with E that contain A and avoid C, R, N.

Some options:

- ""SLATE"": but we have to avoid R? Actually, ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E. It doesn't have C, R, N. But we already know E is in position 5, so that's good. Also, A is in position 3? Wait, in ""SLATE"": S (1), L (2), A (3), T (4), E (5). But our feedback for the first guess said A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we use ""SLATE"", we are putting A in position 3 again, which we know is incorrect. So that would be a waste because we already know A is not in position 3.

Therefore, we should avoid putting A in position 3.

So, we need a word with A in position 1, 2, or 4.

Let me try to find words with A in position 1 and ending with E: e.g., ""A? ? ? E""

Examples: ""ABUSE"", but B and U? We haven't tried B or U. But we also want to test more common letters.

""ABASE"": A, B, A, S, E? Wait, that's two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have to avoid R? ""ABASE"" has A, B, A, S, E. It avoids C, R, N. But it has two A's? Actually, the word is A-B-A-S-E. So A in position 1 and 3. But we know A is not in position 3? Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, it would be marked as absent? Or if the word has two A's, it might be different? Actually, the feedback only tells us about the letters we guessed. In the first guess, we had A in position 3 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one A in the word, but not in position 3. So if we put A in position 3 again, it would be marked as wrong again (if the word has only one A) or if there is another A, it might be correct? But we don't know. To avoid confusion, it's better to put A in a new position.

So, for the second guess, we should put A in either position 1, 2, or 4.

Let me think of words with A in position 1: e.g., ""A? ? ? E""

- ""ABATE"": A, B, A, T, E -> but two A's? And we avoid C, R, N. But we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, B and T are new.

- ""AGAPE"": A, G, A, P, E -> again two A's.

- ""ADAGE"": A, D, A, G, E -> two A's.

- ""ALATE"": A, L, A, T, E -> two A's? Actually, ""ALATE"" is a word? I think it's not common. But let's stick to common words.

Perhaps we should avoid words with two A's for now to keep it simple.

What about A in position 2: ""?A? ? E""

- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> avoids C, R, N. And A is in position 2.

- ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E -> but S and T are common.

- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E -> two T's? But that's okay.

- ""WASTE"": W, A, S, T, E.

- ""MASTE"" is not a word.

""SAUTE"" is a word, meaning to fry quickly.

But let's consider: we also want to test other common letters. We haven't tried S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

Another idea: put A in position 4: ""? ? ? A E""

- ""OPALE"": O, P, A, L, E? But that's 5 letters? O-P-A-L-E. But ""OPALE"" is not common; the common word is ""OPAL"" but that's 4 letters. Actually, ""OPALE"" might not be valid.

- ""SCALE"": but C is in it? We have to avoid C. ""SCALE"" has C, which we know is not in the word.

- ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> avoids C, R, N. And A is in position 4? S(1), T(2), A(3)? Wait, no: S(1), T(2), A(3), L(4), E(5). So A is in position 3 again? We must avoid position 3 for A.

So for position 4: the fourth letter is A and fifth is E, so the word pattern is ? ? ? A E.

Examples: 
- ""PULSE"": P, U, L, S, E -> no A.
- ""PHASE"": P, H, A, S, E -> A is in position 3? H(2), A(3), S(4), E(5). So A is in position 3 again? We need A in position 4? Wait, in ""PHASE"": positions: 1-P, 2-H, 3-A, 4-S, 5-E. So A is in 3, not 4.

To have A in position 4: the word must be ? ? ? A E, meaning the fourth letter is A and fifth is E.

Examples: 
- ""PRAISE"" is 6 letters.
- ""GRACE"" has R and C, which are not allowed.
- ""PLACE"" has C and L? L is allowed, but C is not.

Actually, it's hard to find common words with A in position 4 and E in position 5.

Let me think: 
- ""SUAVE"": S, U, A, V, E -> positions: 1-S, 2-U, 3-A, 4-V, 5-E. So A is in position 3? Not 4.

- ""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E -> A in position 3.

- ""SPADE"": S, P, A, D, E -> A in position 3.

- ""STADE"": S, T, A, D, E -> A in position 3.

It seems that in most 5-letter words ending with E, the A is often in position 1, 2, or 3. Position 4 is rare because the last two letters are A and E? But that would be like ...AE, which is not common.

For example, ""IDEAE"" is not a word. ""CAUSE"" has A in position 3? C(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) — wait, A is in position 2.

Actually, I can't think of a common word with A in position 4 and E in position 5. So maybe we should avoid that.

Therefore, let's focus on A in position 1 or 2.

Position 1: A _ _ _ E

Common words: 
- ""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> avoids C, R, N. And we test B, U, S.
- ""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E -> similar.
- ""AGREE"": A, G, R, E, E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word).
- ""ALONE"": A, L, O, N, E -> but N is not allowed.

So ""ABUSE"" and ""AMUSE"" are options.

Position 2: _ A _ _ E

- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E
- ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E
- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E
- ""WASTE"": W, A, S, T, E
- ""BASTE"": B, A, S, T, E
- ""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E

All these avoid C, R, N.

C(1), A(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) — wait, A is in position 2.\n\nActually, I can\'t think of a common word with A in position 4 and E in position 5. So maybe we should avoid that.\n\nTherefore, let\'s focus on A in position 1 or 2.\n\nPosition 1: A _ _ _ E\n\nCommon words: \n- ""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> avoids C, R, N. And we test B, U, S.\n- ""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E -> similar.\n- ""AGREE"": A, G, R, E, E -> but R is not allowed (we know R is not in the word).\n- ""ALONE"": A, L, O, N, E -> but N is not allowed.\n\nSo ""ABUSE"" and ""AMUSE"" are options.\n\nPosition 2: _ A _ _ E\n\n- ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E\n- ""PASTE"": P, A, S, T, E\n- ""TASTE"": T, A, S, T, E\n- ""WASTE"": W, A, S, T, E\n- ""BASTE"": B, A, S, T, E\n- ""HASTE"": H, A, S, T, E\n\nAll these avoid C, R, N.\n\nWe also want to maximize information by including new common letters.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, O, I, D, H, U, etc.\n\nIn the position 1 words, we have ""ABUSE"" (tests A, B, U, S, E) and ""AMUSE"" (A, M, U, S, E).\n\nIn position 2, we have several with S and T, which are very common.\n\nSince we know E is fixed at the end, and A is somewhere else, we can choose a word that tests S and T.\n\nAlso, note that in the first guess, we had A in position 3, so we know it\'s not there. Now we can test A in position 2, for example.\n\nI think ""SAUTE"" is a good candidate: it has S, A, U, T, E. We test S, U, T, and A in position 2.\n\nBut ""PASTE"" is also good: P, A, S, T, E.\n\nSimilarly, ""WASTE"" is common.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that the word is valid.\n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that has the letter A and also other vowels to test? But we know E is in, and A is in, so we might not need to test more vowels? But we don\'t know about others.\n\nBut we have limited tries, so we should focus on consonants.\n\nI think ""PASTE"" is a good choice: it has common letters P, A, S, T, E. And A is in position 2, which is a new position.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""PASTE"".\n\nBut note: we are avoiding C, R, N, which we are.\n\nSo second guess: ""PASTE""\n\nWe\'ll see the feedback and then adjust.\n\nTherefore, the guess is ""paste"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and N are not in the word (marked as x).\n- A is in the word but not in position 3 (marked as -).\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5, marked as ✓).\n\nKey insights:\n- The secret word ends with E.\n- A is present but not in position 3, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4.\n- The word does not contain C, R, or N.\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""paste"" because:\n- It ends with E (leveraging the known correct position).\n- It places A in position 2 (a new position to test, since position 3 is invalid).\n- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, N).\n- It introduces new common consonants (P, S, T) to gather more information.\n\n<guess>paste</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: paste -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) S(x) T(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: absent (x)
- R: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓)

Second guess: ""paste""
- P: absent (x)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- S: absent (x)
- T: absent (x)
- E: correct position (✓)

What we know so far:
1. The word ends with E (position 5 is E).
2. The letter A is in the word, but not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in position 2 (from second guess, since we put A in position 2 and it's present but wrong position, meaning A is not in position 2).
3. Therefore, A must be in position 1 or 4 (since position 3 and 2 are ruled out, and position 5 is E, so not A).
4. The following letters are absent: C, R, N, P, S, T.

We also know that the word contains A and E, and we have to find the other three letters.

Since A is in position 1 or 4, and we have to avoid the absent letters, we need to think of words that:
- End with E (position 5)
- Have A in position 1 or 4
- Do not contain C, R, N, P, S, T

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, S, T. So we should try to use new common letters to get more information.

Common letters not yet tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, let's consider the two cases for A:

Case 1: A in position 1 (A _ _ _ E)
Case 2: A in position 4 (_ _ _ A E)

But note: if A is in position 4, the word would be _ _ _ A E. However, we must remember that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and was present but wrong position. If A were in position 4, then in the first guess (crane) we had A in position 3, which is adjacent but still wrong. That is possible.

But also, in the second guess, we had A in position 2, which is also wrong. So A is not in 2 or 3, so only 1 or 4 left.

Now, let's think of possible words.

First, if A is in position 1: A _ _ _ E

We need to fill the middle three positions with letters not in {C, R, N, P, S, T} and from the remaining alphabet.

Possible words: 
- AGILE: but G, I, L, E. E is already at the end, so A, G, I, L, E. But we have to check if G, I, L are allowed? They are not in the absent list, so yes.
- ALIKE: A, L, I, K, E
- ALIVE: A, L, I, V, E
- ABIDE: A, B, I, D, E
- ABLE: only 4 letters? No, 5: A, B, L, E, ? Not 5. ""ABLED"" but that's 5: A, B, L, E, D? But position 5 is E, so it would be A, B, L, D, E? That's not ""ABLED"". ""ABLED"" is A-B-L-E-D, so E is in position 4, but we need E in position 5. So not.

We need the word to end with E, so the last letter is fixed as E.

So for A _ _ _ E: 
- The third and fourth letters are variable.

Examples: 
- AWAKE: A, W, A, K, E -> but two A's? We don't know if there are two A's. Also, W and K are new.
- AGAPE: A, G, A, P, E -> but P is absent, so not allowed.
- AMAZE: A, M, A, Z, E -> two A's, and Z is less common.

But we must avoid P, S, T, which are absent, so in ""AMAZE"", P is not there, but we have M, A, Z, E. Z might be rare.

Better to use common letters.

Another: ""ADOBE"": A, D, O, B, E -> avoids the absent letters.

""ADOBE"" is a word.

""AGLOW"": A, G, L, O, W -> but ends with W, not E.

We need E at the end.

""ABOVE"": A, B, O, V, E -> that works.

""ALONE"": but N is absent, so no.

""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> good.

""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E -> but S is absent, so not allowed.

""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> S absent, not allowed.

So, with the constraints, ""ABOVE"" and ""ALIVE"" are candidates.

Now, Case 2: A in position 4: _ _ _ A E

The word pattern: ? ? ? A E

We need to find words that end with ""AE"", but that is rare. Common words?

- ""UKASE"": U, K, A, S, E -> but S is absent, not allowed.
- ""BEAKE"": not a word.
- ""BLARE"": has R, absent.
- ""STARE"": has S and T, absent.
- ""CAUSE"": has C, absent.

It's hard to find common words ending with ""AE"". Let me think.

- ""SUAVE"": S, U, A, V, E -> but S is absent, and also in ""SUAVE"", A is in position 3? S(1), U(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). So A is in position 3, not 4.

To have A in position 4, it must be the fourth letter, so the word is X1, X2, X3, A, E.

Examples: 
- ""OPERA"": O, P, E, R, A -> but that ends with A, not E. We need to end with E.
- ""EXTRA"": ends with A.
- ""UMBRA"": ends with A.

I think it's very rare for a 5-letter word to end with ""AE"". In fact, I can't think of a common English word that ends with ""AE"". 

For example, ""IDEA"" is 4 letters. ""FLEA"" is 4. ""AREA"" is 4. 

5-letter words: ""PIZZA"" ends with A. ""PLAZA"" ends with A. 

Perhaps ""KARMA"" ends with A. 

But we need to end with E. So words ending with ""AE"" are extremely uncommon. 

In the Wordle word list, I don't recall any common word ending with AE. 

Therefore, it is highly likely that A is in position 1, not position 4.

So we can focus on A in position 1: A _ _ _ E

Now, we need to fill the middle three letters with letters not in the absent set: {C, R, N, P, S, T}

Available letters: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc. (but A and E are already known to be in the word, so we need three more distinct letters? Not necessarily, there could be duplicates, but we don't know).

We have to guess a word that fits A _ _ _ E and uses only allowed letters.

We also have the feedback that in ""paste"", A was present but not in position 2, which we already used to rule out position 2.

Now, for the third guess, we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Possible words:
- ABOVE: A, B, O, V, E
- ALIVE: A, L, I, V, E
- ADOBE: A, D, O, B, E
- AGILE: A, G, I, L, E
- ALIKE: A, L, I, K, E
- AMBLE: A, M, B, L, E -> but M, B, L are new.

We should avoid using letters that might be less common, but all these are reasonable.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, so we need to be efficient.

Another idea: we know A is in the word and not in position 2 or 3, so in position 1, and we have E at the end. So the word is A X Y Z E.

We need to find X, Y, Z.

We can try a word that uses common consonants to test.

For example, ""ALIKE"": tests L, I, K.

""ABOVE"": tests B, O, V.

""ALIVE"": tests L, I, V.

I think ""ALIVE"" is a good choice because it has L, I, V which are common and not tried yet.

""ABOVE"" is also good.

But let's see which one might be better.

We could also consider ""ADIEU"", but that ends with U, not E. We need E at the end.

So, I'll go with ""ALIVE"".

Guess: ""ALIVE""

But let's confirm: A in position 1, L in 2, I in 3, V in 4, E in 5.

We know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3, so position 1 is possible.

If the word is ""ALIVE"", then in the first guess ""crane"", A was in position 3, but in ""ALIVE"" A is in position 1, so that matches the feedback (A was present but not in position 3). In the second guess ""paste"", A was in position 2, but in ""ALIVE"" A is in position 1, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? But in ""paste"" we put A in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent if A is in position 1.

Also, ""ALIVE"" avoids all the absent letters: C, R, N, P, S, T.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""ALIVE"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)  
  - E is in the word and in the correct position (position 5).
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, R, and N are not in the word.

- **Guess 2: ""paste""** → Feedback: P(x), A(-), S(x), T(x), E(✓)  
  - E is still in the correct position (position 5).
  - A is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was marked as present but wrong position in both guesses, and position 3 was already ruled out).
  - P, S, and T are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- **E is fixed at position 5**.
- **A must be in position 1 or 4** (positions 2 and 3 are ruled out, and position 5 is E).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, N, P, S, T (cannot be used).
- **Present letters**: A and E are confirmed, with A not in position 2 or 3.
- The word pattern is either `A _ _ _ E` (if A is in position 1) or `_ _ _ A E` (if A is in position 4). However, words ending in ""AE"" (position 4 for A) are rare in English, so A in position 1 is more likely.

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Focus on the `A _ _ _ E` pattern (A in position 1, E in position 5).
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, N, P, S, T) and use new common letters to maximize information (e.g., B, D, G, H, I, L, M, O, U, V).
- ""ALIVE"" is a strong guess because:
  - It tests A in position 1 (a new position to verify).
  - It introduces new common letters: L (position 2), I (position 3), and V (position 4).
  - It avoids all absent letters.
  - If A is not in position 1, the feedback will confirm if A is in position 4 (though unlikely), or provide new information about L, I, and V.

What we know so far:

4. The following letters are absent: C, R, N, P, S, T.

We also know that the word contains A and E, and we have to find the other three letters.

Since A is in position 1 or 4, and we have to avoid the absent letters, we need to think of words that:

- Do not contain C, R, N, P, S, T

We have used the letters: C, R, A, N, E, P, S, T. So we should try to use new common letters to get more information.

Common letters not yet tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Now, let's consider the two cases for A:

Case 1: A in position 1 (A _ _ _ E)
Case 2: A in position 4 (_ _ _ A E)

But note: if A is in position 4, the word would be _ _ _ A E. However, we must remember that in the first guess, A was in position 3 and was present but wrong position.

""ADOBE"" is a word.

""AGLOW"": A, G, L, O, W -> but ends with W, not E.

We need E at the end.

""ABOVE"": A, B, O, V, E -> that works.

""ALONE"": but N is absent, so no.

""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> good.

""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E -> but S is absent, so not allowed.

""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> S absent, not allowed.

So, with the constraints, ""ABOVE"" and ""ALIVE"" are candidates.

Now, Case 2: A in position 4: _ _ _ A E

The word pattern: ? ? ? A E

We need to find words that end with ""AE"", but that is rare. Common words?

- ""UKASE"": U, K, A, S, E -> but S is absent, not allowed.
- ""BEAKE"": not a word.
- ""BLARE"": has R, absent.
- ""STARE"": has S and T, absent.

It's hard to find common words ending with ""AE"". Let me think.

- ""SUAVE"": S, U, A, V, E -> but S is absent, and also in ""SUAVE"", A is in position 3? S(1), U(2), A(3), V(4), E(5). So A is in position 3, not 4.

To have A in position 4, it must be the fourth letter, so the word is X1, X2, X3, A, E.

Examples: 
- ""OPERA"": O, P, E, R, A -> but that ends with A, not E. We need to end with E.
- ""EXTRA"": ends with A.
- ""UMBRA"": ends with A.

I think it's very rare for a 5-letter word to end with ""AE"". In fact, I can't think of a common English word that ends with ""AE"". 

For example, ""IDEA"" is 4 letters. ""FLEA"" is 4. ""AREA"" is 4.

""ABOVE"" is also good.

But let's see which one might be better.

We could also consider ""ADIEU"", but that ends with U, not E. We need E at the end.

So, I'll go with ""ALIVE"".

Guess: ""ALIVE""

But let's confirm: A in position 1, L in 2, I in 3, V in 4, E in 5.

We know A is in the word and not in 2 or 3, so position 1 is possible.

If the word is ""ALIVE"", then in the first guess ""crane"", A was in position 3, but in ""ALIVE"" A is in position 1, so that matches the feedback (A was present but not in position 3). In the second guess ""paste"", A was in position 2, but in ""ALIVE"" A is in position 1, so it should be marked as present but wrong position? But in ""paste"" we put A in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent if A is in position 1.

Also, ""ALIVE"" avoids all the absent letters: C, R, N, P, S, T.

So it's a valid guess.

Therefore, I'll guess ""ALIVE"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(✓)
