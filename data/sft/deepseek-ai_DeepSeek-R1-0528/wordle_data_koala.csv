We are making our first guess. We have no prior feedback.
 Since this is the first guess, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 Good starting words include common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range.
 Some popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""STARE"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.
 Let's choose a word that has unique letters and a good balance of vowels and consonants.

 I'll pick ""RAISE"" as it contains R, A, I, S, E – which are common letters. Also, it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S).

 Therefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".
</think>
<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Uses common letters to increase the chance of hitting letters in the secret word
- Includes a mix of vowels and consonants
- Avoids repeated letters to cover more ground

Based on this, I'll pick ""ROATE"". It is statistically strong because:
- Contains common vowels (O, A, E)
- Uses frequent consonants (R, T)
- Covers five distinct letters
- Is a valid English word (archaic term for ""to grow"")

This choice will provide clear feedback for narrowing down possibilities on the next turn, regardless of which symbols appear.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""ROATE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- O: ✓ (correct letter in the correct position)
- A: ✓ (correct letter in the correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

This tells us:
1. The secret word has O in the second position and A in the third position.
2. The letters R, T, and E are not in the word at all.

Since O is in position 2 and A is in position 3, the word must be of the form: _ O A _ _

We also know that the word does not contain R, T, or E.

We need to choose a new guess that fits:
- Must have O in position 2? Actually, no. We already know that O is in position 2. But note: the feedback for the first guess showed O and A in correct positions, so our next guess should maintain the known letters in those positions to get more information about the other positions.

Therefore, the next guess should have:
- Position 2: O (since we know it is there and correct)
- Position 3: A (similarly)

And avoid the letters: R, T, E.

But note: we must consider that the word does not contain these letters.

Now, we need to choose a word that:
- Has O in the second position and A in the third position.
- Uses only letters that have not been eliminated (avoid R, T, E).
- We want to test other common letters to get more feedback.

Since the first guess eliminated R, T, and E, the remaining letters are available.

The positions we don't know are 1, 4, and 5.

We should pick a word that has the form: [letter1] O A [letter4] [letter5]

Moreover, we want to cover new letters that are frequent to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

Let's brainstorm words that fit the pattern _ O A _ _

Some possibilities:
- COAST (C, S, T) -> T is eliminated? Yes, T is not allowed because first guess had T as not in the word. So we cannot use T -> discard.
- GOALS (G, L, S) -> G, L, S are new letters, and avoids T, R, E -> possible.
- FOAMS (F, M, S) -> also avoids T, R, E.
- LOANS (L, O, A, N, S) -> but note: we already know O and A are in positions 2 and 3? We can use O and A again? Actually, the feedback for the first guess confirmed O and A in correct positions. We don't know if they can appear again? But typically, Wordle words have unique letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have evidence.

But note: the feedback already told us which positions are correct. However, it is possible to have the same letter multiple times? The rules don't say. But in the example, all letters were distinct. Without evidence of duplication, we might assume that letters are not repeated? We don't know.

But looking back at the rules, it says ""Each guess must be a valid English word"" and there are no restrictions. However, the feedback symbols would reveal duplicates.

To be safe, we avoid using the same letter twice unless we suspect duplication? But we have no reason to suspect duplication so far, so let's pick a word without duplication.

Moreover, we know that R, T, E are absent.

So consider:

- GOALS: 
  - G in position 1, O in 2, A in 3, L in 4, S in 5.
  - Avoids R, T, E.
- Other words: COALS -> but C is new, and avoids T? Wait COALS: C,O,A,L,S -> avoids R,T,E -> possible.
- However, note that the feedback for the first word had A in position 3, but if we put A again? No, in GOALS it's only one A.

But what about words that have an O again? Well, the feedback did not indicate multiple Os? But we don't want to test that unnecessarily? Actually, we can use words that reuse letters? However, since we don't know if the word has duplicates, we avoid using the same letter again? Actually, because our goal is to get more information. But we have unused letters to cover.

Furthermore, we know O and A are in the word, but they are already placed correctly. We don't need to test letters we know? We do need to know the other letters.

So I think GOALS is acceptable.

But note: the word must have O and A exactly in positions 2 and 3? That's what feedback told us. So in GOALS, we have O at 2 and A at 3. Also we avoid R,T,E.

Other options: 
- JOANS -> J is not very common? And we don't have information.
- MOANS -> M is a good letter to test.

But let me list possible words that fit:
- BOAST -> but B? We don't know, but the word has T? Eliminated -> discard.
- COALA -> not an English word? Well, we need valid English words.
- COMAE -> but E is eliminated? So discard.
- DOGMA -> but O would be in position 2? Wait: D O G M A -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:G? But we require A in position 3 -> doesn't fit.
- We need the third letter to be A. So pattern must be _ O A _ _

So: 
- Some words: boat (5-letter?), coast (but T and also 5-letter) -> T eliminated -> discard.
- So let me think: 
  - FOAMY -> F O A M Y -> avoids R,T,E? Yes -> possible.
  - GOALS -> G O A L S -> avoids R,T,E -> possible.
  - HOAGY -> H O A G Y -> avoids R,T,E -> valid word? (hoagy: a submarine sandwich) -> uncommon?
  - LOAMY -> L O A M Y -> avoids R,T,E -> possible.

But perhaps we should choose a more common word.

Alternatively, we might try a word that tests common consonants in positions that are unknown.

For instance, position 1: we can try S, L, N, C, etc.
Position 4: we can test S, L, N, etc.
Position 5: we can test S, M, etc.

So GOALS tests G in 1, L in 4, S in 5.

Similarly, FOULS? But we have O and A required. So it must be _ O A _ _

Another word: SOLAR -> but S O L A R: has A in position 4? We need A in position 3 -> discard.

Let me look for words that have the pattern _ O A _ _

- COALS -> but C O A L S: position3 is A -> fits. And avoids T, R? But T is absent? COALS has no T? COALS: letters C,O,A,L,S -> avoids R,T,E -> acceptable.

But note: we already used O and A? But we are allowed to use them again? And they are confirmed to be in the word. But we are going to have them in the same positions? Yes, because we know they are correct. But in positions 2 and 3, we are putting the same letters? That's fine? Actually, yes.

But we get feedback on them: we know they should be marked correct. And that doesn't cost us anything. But we also get to test other letters.

So GOALS: G, L, S -> new letters.
COALS: C, L, S -> similarly.

But I am considering that we have not tried C, G, L, S, etc.

Another option: JOABS -> not a word.

Common words? 
- CLOAK -> but A would be in position 4? Pattern: C L O A K -> position2: L? -> no.

Pattern is fixed: [1] O [3=A] [4] [5]

So I should look for words that start with any letter, then O, then A, then two letters.

For example: 
- coach -> C O A C H -> has H? avoids R,T,E? H is new.
- coats -> T is in it -> eliminated -> discard.
- costa - O A? C O S T A -> T -> discard.
- focal - O A? F O C A L -> position3: C? -> no.

Wait, position3 must be A. So:

- Let me list words: 
  - croak -> C R O A K -> R and R eliminated -> discard.
  - float -> F L O A T -> T -> discard.
  - grant -> G R A N T -> wrong pattern and R,T discarded? Pattern requires O in second? -> discard.
  - we are stuck? 

Alternatively, use a word that has known positions fixed but test other common letters.

Another word: DOUAR -> not common.

Perhaps broaden.

Wordle accepted words:

- KOALA: K O A L A -> but uses A twice? And A in position 3? KOALA: positions 1:K, 2:O, 3:A, 4:L, 5:A -> that has two As. We don't know if A appears twice? The feedback for the first word (ROATE) had one A and it was in third position. But if the secret word has two As? Then our first guess didn't reveal the second A? Actually, in ROATE, we guessed an A, but not in the position of the second A? So we don't know?

So KOALA might be a candidate? And avoids R,T,E? Yes.

But let me check: letters of KOALA: K,O,A,L,A. But we avoid R,T,E -> no R,T,E -> valid.

Similarly, MOCHA -> O A? M O C H A -> position3: C? -> no.

Actually pattern: [1] O A [4] [5]

So:

- SOAPY -> S O A P Y: avoids R,T,E -> possible.
- GOALS -> G O A L S: avoids R,T,E -> possible.

But SOAPY: position4: P, position5: Y -> not common letters? But valid.

Given that KOALA uses an extra A? It might be a risk? But let's see.

To avoid duplication? Actually, we want to get information. KOALA tests K and L and also whether there is another A? But given that we know A is in the word, but if there is another one, then the feedback for the position might reveal? Actually, when we guess KOALA, the feedback for the A in position5 might be (-) if there is another A? Or if the secret word has only one A? Then the second A would be marked 'x'? Or if the secret word has two A's? Then it might be marked (-) for the second A if it is not in the same position.

But the feedback for our guess would show:

- Position 3: A is correct (✓) 
- Position 5: A would be marked as (-) if there is another A in the word? Or? The rules: 
  - ""The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"" 

But note: if the secret word has only one A, then the A in position5 would be 'x'? Because we already used the A in position3? And we got it correct? Then the secret word's A is accounted for? So any extra A would be not in word? 

Actually, Wordle's rules: the feedback color accounts for duplicate letters? Actually, the common rule is:

- If a letter occurs only once in the secret word, then the first occurrence of that letter in the guess is marked appropriately? But I think the official Wordle does handle duplicates? 

But in any case, since we are designing the guess, we might avoid duplication if not necessary.

Therefore, I think GOALS is a safer and more common guess.

But GOALS: G O A L S -> letters new: G, L, S.

If we choose GOALS:

- We know positions 2 and 3 must be O and A (we will mark them accordingly, but they will be correct).
- Then we test G in position1, L in position4, S in position5.

This will tell us:
- If position1 is G? If marked ✓ then we know.
- If position4 is L? etc.

There's another word: COALS -> same thing with C.

But we haven't eliminated any letter except R,T,E? Actually, we also have O and A confirmed? So C and G are both possible.

Other words: SOLAR is not fitting.

After consideration, I think GOALS is a good choice.

Alternatively, we can use SOCCER? but doesn't match pattern.

No, the pattern is fixed.

Another word: BOXER? doesn't have O and A in place.

So GOALS seems fine.

But let me check if GOALS is a valid Wordle word? Yes.

So I'll go with GOALS.

But note: we have 6 tries? So we can afford, and it tests G,L,S.

So guess: GOALS.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (""ROATE"" → R: x, O: ✓, A: ✓, T: x, E: x), we know:
- The secret word has **O** in the second position and **A** in the third position, so the pattern is: _ O A _ _.
- The letters **R**, **T**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all.

For the second guess, we must:
- Maintain **O** in position 2 and **A** in position 3.
- Avoid using the letters R, T, or E.
- Use new, common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to maximize information.

After evaluating options, ""GOALS"" fits well:
- **G** is tested in position 1, **L** in position 4, and **S** in position 5—all are new, frequent letters.
- It is a valid English word and follows the pattern we need.
- It avoids eliminated letters (R, T, E) and focuses on untested consonants.

<thinking>
The feedback narrowed down the word to the form _ O A _ _, eliminating R, T, and E. Common words matching this pattern (like ""COAST"") were rejected due to containing T. ""GOALS"" avoids eliminated letters, introduces new characters (G, L, S), and preserves the confirmed O and A positions. This guess optimizes for information gain—feedback on G, L, and S will help constrain the solution further.
</thinking>

- R: x (not in the word)
- O: ✓ (correct letter in the correct position)

- E: x (not in the word)

This tells us:
1. The secret word has O in the second position and A in the third position.
2. The letters R, T, and E are not in the word at all.

- COALS -> but C O A L S: position3 is A -> fits. And avoids T, R? But T is absent? COALS has no T? COALS: letters C,O,A,L,S -> avoids R,T,E -> acceptable.

But note: we already used O and A? But we are allowed to use them again? And they are confirmed to be in the word. But we are going to have them in the same positions? Yes, because we know they are correct. But in positions 2 and 3, we are putting the same letters? That's fine? Actually, yes.

But we get feedback on them: we know they should be marked correct. And that doesn't cost us anything. But we also get to test other letters.

So GOALS: G, L, S -> new letters.
COALS: C, L, S -> similarly.

But I am considering that we have not tried C, G, L, S, etc.

Another option: JOABS -> not a word.

Common words? 
- CLOAK -> but A would be in position 4? Pattern: C L O A K -> position2: L? -> no.

Pattern is fixed: [1] O [3=A] [4] [5]

So I should look for words that start with any letter, then O, then A, then two letters.

For example: 
- coach -> C O A C H -> has H? avoids R,T,E? H is new.
- coats -> T is in it -> eliminated -> discard.
- costa - O A? C O S T A -> T -> discard.
- focal - O A? F O C A L -> position3: C? -> no.

Wait, position3 must be A. So:

- Let me list words: 
  - croak -> C R O A K -> R and R eliminated -> discard.
  - float -> F L O A T -> T -> discard.
  - grant -> G R A N T -> wrong pattern and R,T discarded? Pattern requires O in second? -> discard.
  - we are stuck? 

Alternatively, use a word that has known positions fixed but test other common letters.

Another word: DOUAR -> not common.

Perhaps broaden.

Wordle accepted words:

- KOALA: K O A L A -> but uses A twice? And A in position 3? KOALA: positions 1:K, 2:O, 3:A, 4:L, 5:A -> that has two As. We don't know if A appears twice? The feedback for the first word (ROATE) had one A and it was in third position. But if the secret word has two As? Then our first guess didn't reveal the second A? Actually, in ROATE, we guessed an A, but not in the position of the second A? So we don't know?

So KOALA might be a candidate? And avoids R,T,E? Yes.

But let me check: letters of KOALA: K,O,A,L,A. But we avoid R,T,E -> no R,T,E -> valid.

Similarly, MOCHA -> O A? M O C H A -> position3: C? -> no.

Actually pattern: [1] O A [4] [5]

So:

- SOAPY -> S O A P Y: avoids R,T,E -> possible.
- GOALS -> G O A L S: avoids R,T,E -> possible.

But SOAPY: position4: P, position5: Y -> not common letters? But valid.

Given that KOALA uses an extra A? It might be a risk? But let's see.

To avoid duplication? Actually, we want to get information. KOALA tests K and L and also whether there is another A? But given that we know A is in the word, but if there is another one, then the feedback for the position might reveal? Actually, when we guess KOALA, the feedback for the A in position5 might be (-) if there is another A? Or if the secret word has only one A? Then the second A would be marked 'x'? Or if the secret word has two A's? Then it might be marked (-) for the second A if it is not in the same position.

But the feedback for our guess would show:

- Position 3: A is correct (✓) 
- Position 5: A would be marked as (-) if there is another A in the word? Or? The rules: 
  - ""The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"" 

But note: if the secret word has only one A, then the A in position5 would be 'x'? Because we already used the A in position3? And we got it correct? Then the secret word's A is accounted for? So any extra A would be not in word? 

Actually, Wordle's rules: the feedback color accounts for duplicate letters? Actually, the common rule is:

- If a letter occurs only once in the secret word, then the first occurrence of that letter in the guess is marked appropriately? But I think the official Wordle does handle duplicates? 

But in any case, since we are designing the guess, we might avoid duplication if not necessary.

Therefore, I think GOALS is a safer and more common guess.

But GOALS: G O A L S -> letters new: G, L, S.

If we choose GOALS:

- We know positions 2 and 3 must be O and A (we will mark them accordingly, but they will be correct).
- Then we test G in position1, L in position4, S in position5.

This will tell us:
- If position1 is G? If marked ✓ then we know.
- If position4 is L? etc.

There's another word: COALS -> same thing with C.

But we haven't eliminated any letter except R,T,E? Actually, we also have O and A confirmed? So C and G are both possible.

Other words: SOLAR is not fitting.

After consideration, I think GOALS is a good choice.

Alternatively, we can use SOCCER? but doesn't match pattern.

No, the pattern is fixed.

Another word: BOXER? doesn't have O and A in place.

So GOALS seems fine.

But let me check if GOALS is a valid Wordle word? Yes.

So I'll go with GOALS.

But note: we have 6 tries? So we can afford, and it tests G,L,S.

So guess: GOALS.Based on the feedback from the first guess (""ROATE"" → R: x, O: ✓, A: ✓, T: x, E: x), we know:
- The secret word has **O** in the second position and **A** in the third position, so the pattern is: _ O A _ _.
- The letters **R**, **T**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all.

For the second guess, we must:
- Maintain **O** in position 2 and **A** in position 3.
- Avoid using the letters R, T, or E.
- Use new, common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to maximize information.

After evaluating options, ""GOALS"" fits well:
- **G** is tested in position 1, **L** in position 4, and **S** in position 5—all are new, frequent letters.
- It is a valid English word and follows the pattern we need.
- It avoids eliminated letters (R, T, E) and focuses on untested consonants.

<thinking>
The feedback narrowed down the word to the form _ O A _ _, eliminating R, T, and E. Common words matching this pattern (like ""COAST"") were rejected due to containing T. ""GOALS"" avoids eliminated letters, introduces new characters (G, L, S), and preserves the confirmed O and A positions. This guess optimizes for information gain—feedback on G, L, and S will help constrain the solution further.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,koala,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. We have no prior feedback.
 Since this is the first guess, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 Good starting words include common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range.
 Some popular starting words are ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""STARE"", ""ROATE"", ""RAISE"", etc.
 Let's choose a word that has unique letters and a good balance of vowels and consonants.

 I'll pick ""RAISE"" as it contains R, A, I, S, E – which are common letters. Also, it has three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S).

 Therefore, my first guess is ""RAISE"".<thinking>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word typically:
- Uses common letters to increase the chance of hitting letters in the secret word
- Includes a mix of vowels and consonants
- Avoids repeated letters to cover more ground

Based on this, I'll pick ""ROATE"". It is statistically strong because:
- Contains common vowels (O, A, E)
- Uses frequent consonants (R, T)
- Covers five distinct letters
- Is a valid English word (archaic term for ""to grow"")

This choice will provide clear feedback for narrowing down possibilities on the next turn, regardless of which symbols appear.
</thinking>

<guess>ROATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ROATE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""ROATE"":
- R: x (not in the word)
- O: ✓ (correct letter in the correct position)
- A: ✓ (correct letter in the correct position)
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

This tells us:
1. The secret word has O in the second position and A in the third position.
2. The letters R, T, and E are not in the word at all.

Since O is in position 2 and A is in position 3, the word must be of the form: _ O A _ _

We also know that the word does not contain R, T, or E.

We need to choose a new guess that fits:
- Must have O in position 2? Actually, no. We already know that O is in position 2. But note: the feedback for the first guess showed O and A in correct positions, so our next guess should maintain the known letters in those positions to get more information about the other positions.

Therefore, the next guess should have:
- Position 2: O (since we know it is there and correct)
- Position 3: A (similarly)

And avoid the letters: R, T, E.

But note: we must consider that the word does not contain these letters.

Now, we need to choose a word that:
- Has O in the second position and A in the third position.
- Uses only letters that have not been eliminated (avoid R, T, E).
- We want to test other common letters to get more feedback.

Since the first guess eliminated R, T, and E, the remaining letters are available.

The positions we don't know are 1, 4, and 5.

We should pick a word that has the form: [letter1] O A [letter4] [letter5]

Moreover, we want to cover new letters that are frequent to maximize information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: S, I, L, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

Let's brainstorm words that fit the pattern _ O A _ _

Some possibilities:
- COAST (C, S, T) -> T is eliminated? Yes, T is not allowed because first guess had T as not in the word. So we cannot use T -> discard.
- GOALS (G, L, S) -> G, L, S are new letters, and avoids T, R, E -> possible.
- FOAMS (F, M, S) -> also avoids T, R, E.
- LOANS (L, O, A, N, S) -> but note: we already know O and A are in positions 2 and 3? We can use O and A again? Actually, the feedback for the first guess confirmed O and A in correct positions. We don't know if they can appear again? But typically, Wordle words have unique letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have evidence.

But note: the feedback already told us which positions are correct. However, it is possible to have the same letter multiple times? The rules don't say. But in the example, all letters were distinct. Without evidence of duplication, we might assume that letters are not repeated? We don't know.

But looking back at the rules, it says ""Each guess must be a valid English word"" and there are no restrictions. However, the feedback symbols would reveal duplicates.

To be safe, we avoid using the same letter twice unless we suspect duplication? But we have no reason to suspect duplication so far, so let's pick a word without duplication.

Moreover, we know that R, T, E are absent.

So consider:

- GOALS: 
  - G in position 1, O in 2, A in 3, L in 4, S in 5.
  - Avoids R, T, E.
- Other words: COALS -> but C is new, and avoids T? Wait COALS: C,O,A,L,S -> avoids R,T,E -> possible.
- However, note that the feedback for the first word had A in position 3, but if we put A again? No, in GOALS it's only one A.

But what about words that have an O again? Well, the feedback did not indicate multiple Os? But we don't want to test that unnecessarily? Actually, we can use words that reuse letters? However, since we don't know if the word has duplicates, we avoid using the same letter again? Actually, because our goal is to get more information. But we have unused letters to cover.

Furthermore, we know O and A are in the word, but they are already placed correctly. We don't need to test letters we know? We do need to know the other letters.

So I think GOALS is acceptable.

But note: the word must have O and A exactly in positions 2 and 3? That's what feedback told us. So in GOALS, we have O at 2 and A at 3. Also we avoid R,T,E.

Other options: 
- JOANS -> J is not very common? And we don't have information.
- MOANS -> M is a good letter to test.

But let me list possible words that fit:
- BOAST -> but B? We don't know, but the word has T? Eliminated -> discard.
- COALA -> not an English word? Well, we need valid English words.
- COMAE -> but E is eliminated? So discard.
- DOGMA -> but O would be in position 2? Wait: D O G M A -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:G? But we require A in position 3 -> doesn't fit.
- We need the third letter to be A. So pattern must be _ O A _ _

So: 
- Some words: boat (5-letter?), coast (but T and also 5-letter) -> T eliminated -> discard.
- So let me think: 
  - FOAMY -> F O A M Y -> avoids R,T,E? Yes -> possible.
  - GOALS -> G O A L S -> avoids R,T,E -> possible.
  - HOAGY -> H O A G Y -> avoids R,T,E -> valid word? (hoagy: a submarine sandwich) -> uncommon?
  - LOAMY -> L O A M Y -> avoids R,T,E -> possible.

But perhaps we should choose a more common word.

Alternatively, we might try a word that tests common consonants in positions that are unknown.

For instance, position 1: we can try S, L, N, C, etc.
Position 4: we can test S, L, N, etc.
Position 5: we can test S, M, etc.

So GOALS tests G in 1, L in 4, S in 5.

Similarly, FOULS? But we have O and A required. So it must be _ O A _ _

Another word: SOLAR -> but S O L A R: has A in position 4? We need A in position 3 -> discard.

Let me look for words that have the pattern _ O A _ _

- COALS -> but C O A L S: position3 is A -> fits. And avoids T, R? But T is absent? COALS has no T? COALS: letters C,O,A,L,S -> avoids R,T,E -> acceptable.

But note: we already used O and A? But we are allowed to use them again? And they are confirmed to be in the word. But we are going to have them in the same positions? Yes, because we know they are correct. But in positions 2 and 3, we are putting the same letters? That's fine? Actually, yes.

But we get feedback on them: we know they should be marked correct. And that doesn't cost us anything. But we also get to test other letters.

So GOALS: G, L, S -> new letters.
COALS: C, L, S -> similarly.

But I am considering that we have not tried C, G, L, S, etc.

Another option: JOABS -> not a word.

Common words? 
- CLOAK -> but A would be in position 4? Pattern: C L O A K -> position2: L? -> no.

Pattern is fixed: [1] O [3=A] [4] [5]

So I should look for words that start with any letter, then O, then A, then two letters.

For example: 
- coach -> C O A C H -> has H? avoids R,T,E? H is new.
- coats -> T is in it -> eliminated -> discard.
- costa - O A? C O S T A -> T -> discard.
- focal - O A? F O C A L -> position3: C? -> no.

Wait, position3 must be A. So:

- Let me list words: 
  - croak -> C R O A K -> R and R eliminated -> discard.
  - float -> F L O A T -> T -> discard.
  - grant -> G R A N T -> wrong pattern and R,T discarded? Pattern requires O in second? -> discard.
  - we are stuck? 

Alternatively, use a word that has known positions fixed but test other common letters.

Another word: DOUAR -> not common.

Perhaps broaden.

Wordle accepted words:

- KOALA: K O A L A -> but uses A twice? And A in position 3? KOALA: positions 1:K, 2:O, 3:A, 4:L, 5:A -> that has two As. We don't know if A appears twice? The feedback for the first word (ROATE) had one A and it was in third position. But if the secret word has two As? Then our first guess didn't reveal the second A? Actually, in ROATE, we guessed an A, but not in the position of the second A? So we don't know?

So KOALA might be a candidate? And avoids R,T,E? Yes.

But let me check: letters of KOALA: K,O,A,L,A. But we avoid R,T,E -> no R,T,E -> valid.

Similarly, MOCHA -> O A? M O C H A -> position3: C? -> no.

Actually pattern: [1] O A [4] [5]

So:

- SOAPY -> S O A P Y: avoids R,T,E -> possible.
- GOALS -> G O A L S: avoids R,T,E -> possible.

But SOAPY: position4: P, position5: Y -> not common letters? But valid.

Given that KOALA uses an extra A? It might be a risk? But let's see.

To avoid duplication? Actually, we want to get information. KOALA tests K and L and also whether there is another A? But given that we know A is in the word, but if there is another one, then the feedback for the position might reveal? Actually, when we guess KOALA, the feedback for the A in position5 might be (-) if there is another A? Or if the secret word has only one A? Then the second A would be marked 'x'?

But the feedback for our guess would show:

- Position 3: A is correct (✓) 
- Position 5: A would be marked as (-) if there is another A in the word? Or? The rules: 
  - ""The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"" 

But note: if the secret word has only one A, then the A in position5 would be 'x'? Because we already used the A in position3? And we got it correct? Then the secret word's A is accounted for? So any extra A would be not in word? 

Actually, Wordle's rules: the feedback color accounts for duplicate letters? Actually, the common rule is:

- If a letter occurs only once in the secret word, then the first occurrence of that letter in the guess is marked appropriately? But I think the official Wordle does handle duplicates? 

But in any case, since we are designing the guess, we might avoid duplication if not necessary.

Therefore, I think GOALS is a safer and more common guess.

There's another word: COALS -> same thing with C.

But we haven't eliminated any letter except R,T,E? Actually, we also have O and A confirmed? So C and G are both possible.

After consideration, I think GOALS is a good choice.

Alternatively, we can use SOCCER? but doesn't match pattern.

No, the pattern is fixed.

Another word: BOXER? doesn't have O and A in place.

So GOALS seems fine.

But let me check if GOALS is a valid Wordle word? Yes.

So I'll go with GOALS.

But note: we have 6 tries? So we can afford, and it tests G,L,S.

So guess: GOALS.Based on the feedback from the first guess (""ROATE"" → R: x, O: ✓, A: ✓, T: x, E: x), we know:
- The secret word has **O** in the second position and **A** in the third position, so the pattern is: _ O A _ _.
- The letters **R**, **T**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all.

For the second guess, we must:
- Maintain **O** in position 2 and **A** in position 3.
- Avoid using the letters R, T, or E.
- Use new, common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to maximize information.

Actually, we can use words that reuse letters? However, since we don\'t know if the word has duplicates, we avoid using the same letter again? Actually, because our goal is to get more information. But we have unused letters to cover.\n\nFurthermore, we know O and A are in the word, but they are already placed correctly. We don\'t need to test letters we know? We do need to know the other letters.\n\nSo I think GOALS is acceptable.\n\nBut note: the word must have O and A exactly in positions 2 and 3? That\'s what feedback told us. So in GOALS, we have O at 2 and A at 3. Also we avoid R,T,E.\n\nOther options: \n- JOANS -> J is not very common? And we don\'t have information.\n- MOANS -> M is a good letter to test.\n\nBut let me list possible words that fit:\n- BOAST -> but B? We don\'t know, but the word has T? Eliminated -> discard.\n- COALA -> not an English word? Well, we need valid English words.\n- COMAE -> but E is eliminated? So discard.\n- DOGMA -> but O would be in position 2? Wait: D O G M A -> positions: 1:D, 2:O, 3:G? But we require A in position 3 -> doesn\'t fit.\n- We need the third letter to be A. So pattern must be _ O A _ _\n\nSo: \n- Some words: boat (5-letter?), coast (but T and also 5-letter) -> T eliminated -> discard.\n- So let me think: \n  - FOAMY -> F O A M Y -> avoids R,T,E? Yes -> possible.\n  - GOALS -> G O A L S -> avoids R,T,E -> possible.\n  - HOAGY -> H O A G Y -> avoids R,T,E -> valid word? (hoagy: a submarine sandwich) -> uncommon?\n  - LOAMY -> L O A M Y -> avoids R,T,E -> possible.\n\nBut perhaps we should choose a more common word.\n\nAlternatively, we might try a word that tests common consonants in positions that are unknown.\n\nFor instance, position 1: we can try S, L, N, C, etc.\nPosition 4: we can test S, L, N, etc.\nPosition 5: we can test S, M, etc.\n\nSo GOALS tests G in 1, L in 4, S in 5.\n\nSimilarly, FOULS? But we have O and A required. So it must be _ O A _ _\n\nAnother word: SOLAR -> but S O L A R: has A in position 4? We need A in position 3 -> discard.\n\nLet me look for words that have the pattern _ O A _ _\n\n- COALS -> but C O A L S: position3 is A -> fits. And avoids T, R? But T is absent? COALS has no T? COALS: letters C,O,A,L,S -> avoids R,T,E -> acceptable.\n\nBut note: we already used O and A? But we are allowed to use them again? And they are confirmed to be in the word. But we are going to have them in the same positions? Yes, because we know they are correct. But in positions 2 and 3, we are putting the same letters? That\'s fine? Actually, yes.\n\nBut we get feedback on them: we know they should be marked correct. And that doesn\'t cost us anything. But we also get to test other letters.\n\nSo GOALS: G, L, S -> new letters.\nCOALS: C, L, S -> similarly.\n\nBut I am considering that we have not tried C, G, L, S, etc.\n\nAnother option: JOABS -> not a word.\n\nCommon words? \n- CLOAK -> but A would be in position 4? Pattern: C L O A K -> position2: L? -> no.\n\nPattern is fixed: [1] O [3=A] [4] [5]\n\nSo I should look for words that start with any letter, then O, then A, then two letters.\n\nFor example: \n- coach -> C O A C H -> has H? avoids R,T,E? H is new.\n- coats -> T is in it -> eliminated -> discard.\n- costa - O A? C O S T A -> T -> discard.\n- focal - O A? F O C A L -> position3: C? -> no.\n\nWait, position3 must be A. So:\n\n- Let me list words: \n  - croak -> C R O A K -> R and R eliminated -> discard.\n  - float -> F L O A T -> T -> discard.\n  - grant -> G R A N T -> wrong pattern and R,T discarded? Pattern requires O in second? -> discard.\n  - we are stuck? \n\nAlternatively, use a word that has known positions fixed but test other common letters.\n\nAnother word: DOUAR -> not common.\n\nPerhaps broaden.\n\nWordle accepted words:\n\n- KOALA: K O A L A -> but uses A twice? And A in position 3? KOALA: positions 1:K, 2:O, 3:A, 4:L, 5:A -> that has two As. We don\'t know if A appears twice? The feedback for the first word (ROATE) had one A and it was in third position. But if the secret word has two As? Then our first guess didn\'t reveal the second A? Actually, in ROATE, we guessed an A, but not in the position of the second A? So we don\'t know?\n\nSo KOALA might be a candidate? And avoids R,T,E? Yes.\n\nBut let me check: letters of KOALA: K,O,A,L,A. But we avoid R,T,E -> no R,T,E -> valid.\n\nSimilarly, MOCHA -> O A? M O C H A -> position3: C? -> no.\n\nActually pattern: [1] O A [4] [5]\n\nSo:\n\n- SOAPY -> S O A P Y: avoids R,T,E -> possible.\n- GOALS -> G O A L S: avoids R,T,E -> possible.\n\nBut SOAPY: position4: P, position5: Y -> not common letters? But valid.\n\nGiven that KOALA uses an extra A? It might be a risk? But let\'s see.\n\nTo avoid duplication? Actually, we want to get information. KOALA tests K and L and also whether there is another A? But given that we know A is in the word, but if there is another one, then the feedback for the position might reveal? Actually, when we guess KOALA, the feedback for the A in position5 might be (-) if there is another A? Or if the secret word has only one A? Then the second A would be marked \'x\'? Or if the secret word has two A\'s? Then it might be marked (-) for the second A if it is not in the same position.\n\nBut the feedback for our guess would show:\n\n- Position 3: A is correct (✓) \n- Position 5: A would be marked as (-) if there is another A in the word? Or? The rules: \n  - ""The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position"" \n\nBut note: if the secret word has only one A, then the A in position5 would be \'x\'? Because we already used the A in position3? And we got it correct? Then the secret word\'s A is accounted for? So any extra A would be not in word? \n\nActually, Wordle\'s rules: the feedback color accounts for duplicate letters? Actually, the common rule is:\n\n- If a letter occurs only once in the secret word, then the first occurrence of that letter in the guess is marked appropriately? But I think the official Wordle does handle duplicates? \n\nBut in any case, since we are designing the guess, we might avoid duplication if not necessary.\n\nTherefore, I think GOALS is a safer and more common guess.\n\nBut GOALS: G O A L S -> letters new: G, L, S.\n\nIf we choose GOALS:\n\n- We know positions 2 and 3 must be O and A (we will mark them accordingly, but they will be correct).\n- Then we test G in position1, L in position4, S in position5.\n\nThis will tell us:\n- If position1 is G? If marked ✓ then we know.\n- If position4 is L? etc.\n\nThere\'s another word: COALS -> same thing with C.\n\nBut we haven\'t eliminated any letter except R,T,E? Actually, we also have O and A confirmed? So C and G are both possible.\n\nOther words: SOLAR is not fitting.\n\nAfter consideration, I think GOALS is a good choice.\n\nAlternatively, we can use SOCCER? but doesn\'t match pattern.\n\nNo, the pattern is fixed.\n\nAnother word: BOXER? doesn\'t have O and A in place.\n\nSo GOALS seems fine.\n\nBut let me check if GOALS is a valid Wordle word? Yes.\n\nSo I\'ll go with GOALS.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries? So we can afford, and it tests G,L,S.\n\nSo guess: GOALS.Based on the feedback from the first guess (""ROATE"" → R: x, O: ✓, A: ✓, T: x, E: x), we know:\n- The secret word has **O** in the second position and **A** in the third position, so the pattern is: _ O A _ _.\n- The letters **R**, **T**, and **E** are not in the secret word at all.\n\nFor the second guess, we must:\n- Maintain **O** in position 2 and **A** in position 3.\n- Avoid using the letters R, T, or E.\n- Use new, common letters in positions 1, 4, and 5 to maximize information.\n\nAfter evaluating options, ""GOALS"" fits well:\n- **G** is tested in position 1, **L** in position 4, and **S** in position 5—all are new, frequent letters.\n- It is a valid English word and follows the pattern we need.\n- It avoids eliminated letters (R, T, E) and focuses on untested consonants.\n\n<thinking>\nThe feedback narrowed down the word to the form _ O A _ _, eliminating R, T, and E. Common words matching this pattern (like ""COAST"") were rejected due to containing T. ""GOALS"" avoids eliminated letters, introduces new characters (G, L, S), and preserves the confirmed O and A positions. This guess optimizes for information gain—feedback on G, L, and S will help constrain the solution further.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>GOALS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: ROATE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) O(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: GOALS -> FEEDBACK: G(x) O(✓) A(✓) L(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ROATE -> R(x) O(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R: not in the word
- O: correct and in position 2
- A: correct and in position 3
- T: not in the word
- E: not in the word

Guess 2: GOALS -> G(x) O(✓) A(✓) L(✓) S(x)
Meaning:
- G: not in the word
- O: correct and in position 2 (as before)
- A: correct and in position 3 (as before)
- L: correct and in position 4
- S: not in the word

So from the feedback, we know:
- The word has the form: _ O A L _ 
  (since O in position 2, A in position 3, and L in position 4 are confirmed)
- We also know that the following letters are not in the word: R, T, E, G, S.

Additionally, we have used the letters: R, O, A, T, E, G, L, S.

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern: [1] O A L [5]

And the missing letters (position 1 and 5) must be letters that are not in the excluded list (R, T, E, G, S) and not O, A, L (which are already in the word, but we can use them again only if the word has duplicates? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates? But note: we have to consider the possibility.

But the feedback for GOALS: 
- O was already known and in the same position, so it's still ✓.
- A was known and in the same position, ✓.
- L is new and in the correct position, so we know L is in the word and in position 4.

Now, for the secret word, we have positions:
1: unknown (but not R, T, E, G, S; and not O, A, L? because if they were in the word, they would have been revealed? Not necessarily: in the first guess, we only had one A and one O. But if the word has two of the same letter, we might not know. However, in GOALS, we used L and it was correct in position 4. If the word had another L, we would have seen it? Actually, in GOALS, we only have one L. So if the secret word has two L's, then in the feedback for GOALS, the L in position4 would be ✓, but if there is another L in the word, we wouldn't know because we didn't put an L in another position? So we cannot rule out duplicates? But we have no evidence for duplicates.

To be safe, we should avoid using letters that are already known? But we have to fill position1 and position5 with letters that are not excluded and not used? But we can use letters that are not in the word? Actually, we are trying to find the correct letters.

But we know the word has O, A, L. And we are missing two letters: one at the start and one at the end.

The excluded letters are: R, T, E, G, S.

Also, we have used: O, A, L, and we know they are in the word. So for the remaining positions, we should use new letters to test.

But what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication, so we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we can't assume that. But to maximize information, we should use new letters.

So we need to choose a word of the form: [1] O A L [5]

Where [1] and [5] are letters that are not in {R, T, E, G, S} and also not O, A, L (if we assume no duplicates). But if we don't assume no duplicates, then we could use O, A, L again? But that would be inefficient? Because we already know about them? So better to use new letters.

Therefore, we look for a word that has the pattern and uses new letters.

Available letters: we have 26 letters minus the excluded ones (R, T, E, G, S) and minus the known ones (O, A, L) that we assume are the only occurrences? But we don't know. So we avoid using O, A, L again? Actually, we can use them only if necessary? But we have two positions to fill and we want to test new letters.

So let's list possible letters for position1 and position5: 
The alphabet without R, T, E, G, S, O, A, L? But O, A, L are in the word, but we don't want to use them again? Because we are testing for other letters? So we avoid them? But if we avoid them, then we are forced to use other letters.

So the available letters for position1 and position5 are: 
B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need a word that has the form: [1] O A L [5] and [1] and [5] are from the above set.

Let's think of common words that fit:

- Possible words:
  - LOCAL: but L is at position1? Then pattern: L O C A L -> but we have O in position2, A in position3, then L in position4? But in LOCAL: 
    position1: L, position2: O, position3: C, position4: A, position5: L -> doesn't match because we need position3 to be A? Here it's C. So no.
  - FOCAL: F O C A L -> position3: C? -> no, we need A at position3? Actually, FOCAL: F(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5) -> but we need A at position3? So no.
  - We need the pattern: 1:?, 2:O, 3:A, 4:L, 5:?

So:
  - position1: must be a consonant? or vowel? 
  - position5: can be a vowel or consonant.

Examples:
  - DOLLY: D O L L Y -> but position3 is L? not A -> no.
  - FOAL? but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words:
  - CHOAL? not a word.
  - KHOAL? not a word.
  - Let me think: 
    - VOCAL: V O C A L -> but position3: C? -> no, we need A at position3? VOCAL: V(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5) -> so position3 is C, not A -> doesn't match.

We need the third letter to be A. So:

  - How about: 
    - BOXAL? not a word.
    - COALY? C O A L Y -> that's a word? (coal-y? not common) but let's check: ""coaly"" is an adjective meaning of or like coal. So valid? 
      - Pattern: C(1), O(2), A(3), L(4), Y(5) -> matches.
    - FOALY? not a word.
    - HOLLA: H O L L A -> position3: L? not A -> no.
    - JOLLY: J O L L Y -> position3: L? no.
    - MOULD: M O U L D -> position3: U? not A -> no.

Another word: 
  - DOULA: D O U L A -> position3: U? not A -> no.

Wait, we need position3 to be A? So the word must have A in the third position? So the pattern is: [1] O A L [5]

So:
  - The only word I can think of is ""local"" but that has A in position4? Not 3.

Perhaps ""koala"" but that is K O A L A -> that fits: 
  - K(1), O(2), A(3), L(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? And we already have A in position3? So position5 is also A? 

But is ""koala"" a valid word? Yes.

And the letters: K and A (again). But we have excluded R,T,E,G,S. K is not excluded? And A is already known? But we are using it again? 

In the feedback for ""koala"", we would get:
  - Position1: K -> if correct, then ✓, else if not in word, x, or if in word but wrong position, -.
  - Position2: O -> ✓ (already known)
  - Position3: A -> ✓ (already known)
  - Position4: L -> ✓ (already known)
  - Position5: A -> if the word has two A's, then it might be - (if the secret word has an A in position5? but we don't know) or x if only one A? 

But the secret word pattern is _ O A L _ 

We don't know what the last letter is? It could be A? 

But we have to consider: the secret word might be ""koala""? 

But let me see if there are other words.

Another word: ""vocal"" doesn't fit.

What about ""moral""? M O R A L -> but R is excluded? R is in the excluded list? Yes, from first guess: R is not in the word. So ""moral"" has R -> invalid.

""royal"" has R and Y? R excluded.

""focal"" doesn't fit.

Perhaps ""tonal""? T is excluded? T is in the excluded list? Yes, from first guess: T is not in the word. So ""tonal"" has T -> invalid.

""coral"" has R and C? R excluded.

I think ""koala"" is a candidate? But let me see if there are others.

Another word: ""dotal""? T excluded.

""folia""? F O L I A -> but pattern: F(1), O(2), L(3), I(4), A(5) -> but we need position3 to be A? Here it's L? and position4 is I? and position5 is A? -> doesn't match.

""axial""? A X I A L -> pattern: A(1), X(2), I(3), A(4), L(5) -> doesn't have O in position2? -> no.

We need O in position2? So the word must have O in the second position? 

So the word must be: [1] O A L [5]

So the only common word I can think of is ""koala"". 

But let me search for more words:

- ""coala"" -> variant of koala? not standard.
- ""boabs"" -> B O A B S -> but S is excluded? and pattern: B(1), O(2), A(3), B(4), S(5) -> but S is excluded? and we have B twice? 
- ""boaks"" -> not a word.

Another possibility: ""doats"" -> D O A T S -> but T and S are excluded? -> invalid.

""hoagy"" -> H O A G Y -> but G is excluded? from second guess: G is not in the word? So G is excluded? Yes, from GOALS: G(x) -> so G is not in the word? So we cannot use G.

In GOALS, G was guessed and marked x, so G is not in the word? So we must avoid G.

Similarly, S is excluded? So we avoid S.

So in ""koala"", we have K, O, A, L, A. K is not excluded? L is already in the word? But we are using it again? Actually, in ""koala"", L is in position4? We know L is in position4? So that's fine? But we are using A again? 

But the secret word might have two A's? 

Another word: ""vozhd""? not a word.

""yowal""? not a word.

""jowar""? J O W A R -> R excluded? and pattern: J(1), O(2), W(3), A(4), R(5) -> position3 is W? not A -> no.

I think ""koala"" is the only common word that fits? 

But let me confirm: 
- K is not excluded? 
- O, A, L are in the word? 
- And we have A at the end? 

But we don't know if the word has two A's? 

Alternatively, is there a word like ""loyal""? L O Y A L -> but L is at position1? and we have L at position4? and R? no, no R? ""loyal"": L O Y A L -> pattern: L(1), O(2), Y(3), A(4), L(5) -> but we need A at position3? Here it's at position4? -> no.

Another word: ""modal""? M O D A L -> pattern: M(1), O(2), D(3), A(4), L(5) -> but we need A at position3? Here it's at position4? -> no.

""aural""? A U R A L -> R excluded? and pattern: A(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5) -> no O? -> no.

I think we have to go with ""koala"". 

But let me think: is there a word like ""foals""? but S is excluded? and we have S in GOALS? and it was x? so S is not in the word? so we cannot use S.

Similarly, ""coals"" has S? excluded.

So ""koala"" seems to be the only option? 

But we have to consider: the secret word might be ""koala""? 

But we have to make a guess? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have the known letters? But that would be inefficient? Because we know O, A, L are in the word? And we know their positions? So we should keep them? 

But in this case, we have to fill the first and last positions? 

Another word: ""dowly""? not a word.

""bowla""? B O W L A -> pattern: B(1), O(2), W(3), L(4), A(5) -> but we need position3 to be A? Here it's W? -> no.

""howfs""? not a word.

I think we have to accept ""koala"" as the guess? 

But let me check the dictionary: 
- koala is a valid word.

So I'll go with ""koala"".

But note: in ""koala"", we are using A twice? And we know A is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? 

The feedback will tell us? 

So guess: KOALA.

But let me see the positions: 
- Position1: K
- Position2: O (known)
- Position3: A (known)
- Position4: L (known)
- Position5: A

If the secret word is ""koala"", then we get all ✓.

If not, then we get feedback on K and the last A.

But what if the secret word is, say, ""vocal""? But ""vocal"" doesn't fit the pattern? Because we need O in position2 and A in position3? ""vocal"" has O in position2, but A in position4? So it doesn't match.

So the only possibility is that the word has the pattern _ O A L _ and the missing letters are from the available set.

Another word: ""dhole""? D H O L E -> but E is excluded? and pattern: D(1), H(2), O(3), L(4), E(5) -> position2 is H? not O -> no.

I think ""koala"" is the best bet.

So I'll guess ""koala"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ROATE** → R(✗), O(✓), A(✓), T(✗), E(✗)  
  This reveals:  
  - O is in the word and **correctly positioned at index 2**.  
  - A is in the word and **correctly positioned at index 3**.  
  - R, T, and E are **not in the word**.

- **Guess 2: GOALS** → G(✗), O(✓), A(✓), L(✓), S(✗)  
  This reveals:  
  - O (position 2) and A (position 3) are confirmed correct (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - L is in the word and **correctly positioned at index 4**.  
  - G and S are **not in the word**.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ O A L _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are confirmed as O, A, and L).
- Positions 1 and 5 are unknown.
- **Excluded letters**: R, T, E, G, S (all marked ✗ in previous guesses).
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: O, A, L (but we don't know if duplicates exist).
- Since O, A, and L are already placed correctly, the next guess should prioritize testing **new, common letters** in positions 1 and 5 to maximize information gain.
- After excluding used letters (R, O, A, T, E, G, L, S), the available letters for positions 1 and 5 include: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Analysis for Guess 3:
- The goal is to find a valid 5-letter word fitting `[1] O A L [5]`, using new letters to test positions 1 and 5.
- After evaluating possibilities, **KOALA** is the strongest guess:
  - **Fits the pattern**: K (position 1), O (position 2), A (position 3), L (position 4), A (position 5).
  - **Tests new letters**: 
    - **K** in position 1 (not previously tested).
    - **A** in position 5 (tests for a potential duplicate A; if marked ✓, it confirms two A's; if ✗, A is single-occurrence).
  - Avoids all excluded letters (R, T, E, G, S).
  - Provides critical feedback: A correct K in position 1 or a duplicate A would solve the word, while a ✗ on K or A narrows possibilities further.
- Other words like ""COALY"" (C O A L Y) were considered, but ""KOALA"" is more common and tests a duplicate letter scenario efficiently.

<guess>KOALA</guess>",KOALA,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: ROATE -> R(x) O(✓) A(✓) T(x) E(x)
Meaning:
- R: not in the word
- O: correct and in position 2
- A: correct and in position 3
- T: not in the word
- E: not in the word

Guess 2: GOALS -> G(x) O(✓) A(✓) L(✓) S(x)
Meaning:
- G: not in the word
- O: correct and in position 2 (as before)
- A: correct and in position 3 (as before)
- L: correct and in position 4
- S: not in the word

So from the feedback, we know:
- The word has the form: _ O A L _ 
  (since O in position 2, A in position 3, and L in position 4 are confirmed)
- We also know that the following letters are not in the word: R, T, E, G, S.

Additionally, we have used the letters: R, O, A, T, E, G, L, S.

Now, we need to find a word that fits the pattern: [1] O A L [5]

And the missing letters (position 1 and 5) must be letters that are not in the excluded list (R, T, E, G, S) and not O, A, L (which are already in the word, but we can use them again only if the word has duplicates? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates? But note: we have to consider the possibility.

But the feedback for GOALS: 
- O was already known and in the same position, so it's still ✓.
- A was known and in the same position, ✓.
- L is new and in the correct position, so we know L is in the word and in position 4.

Now, for the secret word, we have positions:
1: unknown (but not R, T, E, G, S; and not O, A, L? because if they were in the word, they would have been revealed? Not necessarily: in the first guess, we only had one A and one O. But if the word has two of the same letter, we might not know. However, in GOALS, we used L and it was correct in position 4. If the word had another L, we would have seen it? Actually, in GOALS, we only have one L. So if the secret word has two L's, then in the feedback for GOALS, the L in position4 would be ✓, but if there is another L in the word, we wouldn't know because we didn't put an L in another position? So we cannot rule out duplicates? But we have no evidence for duplicates.

To be safe, we should avoid using letters that are already known? But we have to fill position1 and position5 with letters that are not excluded and not used? But we can use letters that are not in the word? Actually, we are trying to find the correct letters.

But we know the word has O, A, L. And we are missing two letters: one at the start and one at the end.

The excluded letters are: R, T, E, G, S.

Also, we have used: O, A, L, and we know they are in the word. So for the remaining positions, we should use new letters to test.

But what about the possibility that the word has duplicate letters? We don't have any indication, so we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we can't assume that. But to maximize information, we should use new letters.

So we need to choose a word of the form: [1] O A L [5]

Where [1] and [5] are letters that are not in {R, T, E, G, S} and also not O, A, L (if we assume no duplicates). But if we don't assume no duplicates, then we could use O, A, L again? But that would be inefficient? Because we already know about them? So better to use new letters.

Therefore, we look for a word that has the pattern and uses new letters.

Available letters: we have 26 letters minus the excluded ones (R, T, E, G, S) and minus the known ones (O, A, L) that we assume are the only occurrences? But we don't know. So we avoid using O, A, L again? Actually, we can use them only if necessary? But we have two positions to fill and we want to test new letters.

So let's list possible letters for position1 and position5: 
The alphabet without R, T, E, G, S, O, A, L? But O, A, L are in the word, but we don't want to use them again? Because we are testing for other letters? So we avoid them? But if we avoid them, then we are forced to use other letters.

So the available letters for position1 and position5 are: 
B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need a word that has the form: [1] O A L [5] and [1] and [5] are from the above set.

Let's think of common words that fit:

- Possible words:
  - LOCAL: but L is at position1? Then pattern: L O C A L -> but we have O in position2, A in position3, then L in position4? But in LOCAL: 
    position1: L, position2: O, position3: C, position4: A, position5: L -> doesn't match because we need position3 to be A? Here it's C. So no.
  - FOCAL: F O C A L -> position3: C? -> no, we need A at position3? Actually, FOCAL: F(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5) -> but we need A at position3? So no.
  - We need the pattern: 1:?, 2:O, 3:A, 4:L, 5:?

So:
  - position1: must be a consonant? or vowel? 
  - position5: can be a vowel or consonant.

Examples:
  - DOLLY: D O L L Y -> but position3 is L? not A -> no.
  - FOAL? but that's 4 letters? We need 5 letters.

5-letter words:
  - CHOAL? not a word.
  - KHOAL? not a word.
  - Let me think: 
    - VOCAL: V O C A L -> but position3: C? -> no, we need A at position3? VOCAL: V(1), O(2), C(3), A(4), L(5) -> so position3 is C, not A -> doesn't match.

We need the third letter to be A. So:

  - How about: 
    - BOXAL? not a word.
    - COALY? C O A L Y -> that's a word? (coal-y? not common) but let's check: ""coaly"" is an adjective meaning of or like coal. So valid? 
      - Pattern: C(1), O(2), A(3), L(4), Y(5) -> matches.
    - FOALY? not a word.
    - HOLLA: H O L L A -> position3: L? not A -> no.
    - JOLLY: J O L L Y -> position3: L? no.
    - MOULD: M O U L D -> position3: U? not A -> no.

Another word: 
  - DOULA: D O U L A -> position3: U? not A -> no.

Wait, we need position3 to be A? So the word must have A in the third position? So the pattern is: [1] O A L [5]

So:
  - The only word I can think of is ""local"" but that has A in position4? Not 3.

Perhaps ""koala"" but that is K O A L A -> that fits: 
  - K(1), O(2), A(3), L(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? And we already have A in position3? So position5 is also A? 

But is ""koala"" a valid word? Yes.

And the letters: K and A (again). But we have excluded R,T,E,G,S. K is not excluded? And A is already known? But we are using it again? 

In the feedback for ""koala"", we would get:
  - Position1: K -> if correct, then ✓, else if not in word, x, or if in word but wrong position, -.
  - Position2: O -> ✓ (already known)
  - Position3: A -> ✓ (already known)
  - Position4: L -> ✓ (already known)
  - Position5: A -> if the word has two A's, then it might be - (if the secret word has an A in position5? but we don't know) or x if only one A? 

But the secret word pattern is _ O A L _ 

We don't know what the last letter is? It could be A? 

But we have to consider: the secret word might be ""koala""? 

But let me see if there are other words.

Another word: ""vocal"" doesn't fit.

What about ""moral""? M O R A L -> but R is excluded? R is in the excluded list? Yes, from first guess: R is not in the word. So ""moral"" has R -> invalid.

""royal"" has R and Y? R excluded.

""focal"" doesn't fit.

Perhaps ""tonal""? T is excluded? T is in the excluded list? Yes, from first guess: T is not in the word. So ""tonal"" has T -> invalid.

""coral"" has R and C? R excluded.

I think ""koala"" is a candidate? But let me see if there are others.

Another word: ""dotal""? T excluded.

""folia""? F O L I A -> but pattern: F(1), O(2), L(3), I(4), A(5) -> but we need position3 to be A? Here it's L? and position4 is I? and position5 is A? -> doesn't match.

""axial""? A X I A L -> pattern: A(1), X(2), I(3), A(4), L(5) -> doesn't have O in position2? -> no.

We need O in position2? So the word must have O in the second position? 

So the word must be: [1] O A L [5]

So the only common word I can think of is ""koala"". 

But let me search for more words:

- ""coala"" -> variant of koala? not standard.
- ""boabs"" -> B O A B S -> but S is excluded? and pattern: B(1), O(2), A(3), B(4), S(5) -> but S is excluded? and we have B twice? 
- ""boaks"" -> not a word.

Another possibility: ""doats"" -> D O A T S -> but T and S are excluded? -> invalid.

""hoagy"" -> H O A G Y -> but G is excluded? from second guess: G is not in the word? So G is excluded? Yes, from GOALS: G(x) -> so G is not in the word? So we cannot use G.

In GOALS, G was guessed and marked x, so G is not in the word? So we must avoid G.

Similarly, S is excluded? So we avoid S.

So in ""koala"", we have K, O, A, L, A. K is not excluded? L is already in the word? But we are using it again? Actually, in ""koala"", L is in position4? We know L is in position4? So that's fine? But we are using A again? 

But the secret word might have two A's? 

Another word: ""vozhd""? not a word.

""yowal""? not a word.

""jowar""? J O W A R -> R excluded? and pattern: J(1), O(2), W(3), A(4), R(5) -> position3 is W? not A -> no.

I think ""koala"" is the only common word that fits? 

But let me confirm: 
- K is not excluded? 
- O, A, L are in the word? 
- And we have A at the end? 

But we don't know if the word has two A's? 

Alternatively, is there a word like ""loyal""? L O Y A L -> but L is at position1? and we have L at position4? and R? no, no R? ""loyal"": L O Y A L -> pattern: L(1), O(2), Y(3), A(4), L(5) -> but we need A at position3? Here it's at position4? -> no.

Another word: ""modal""? M O D A L -> pattern: M(1), O(2), D(3), A(4), L(5) -> but we need A at position3? Here it's at position4? -> no.

""aural""? A U R A L -> R excluded? and pattern: A(1), U(2), R(3), A(4), L(5) -> no O? -> no.

I think we have to go with ""koala"". 

But let me think: is there a word like ""foals""? but S is excluded? and we have S in GOALS? and it was x? so S is not in the word? so we cannot use S.

Similarly, ""coals"" has S? excluded.

So ""koala"" seems to be the only option? 

But we have to consider: the secret word might be ""koala""? 

But we have to make a guess? 

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have the known letters? But that would be inefficient? Because we know O, A, L are in the word? And we know their positions? So we should keep them? 

But in this case, we have to fill the first and last positions? 

Another word: ""dowly""? not a word.

""bowla""? B O W L A -> pattern: B(1), O(2), W(3), L(4), A(5) -> but we need position3 to be A? Here it's W? -> no.

""howfs""? not a word.

I think we have to accept ""koala"" as the guess? 

But let me check the dictionary: 
- koala is a valid word.

So I'll go with ""koala"".

But note: in ""koala"", we are using A twice? And we know A is in the word? But we don't know if it appears twice? 

The feedback will tell us? 

So guess: KOALA.

But let me see the positions: 
- Position1: K
- Position2: O (known)
- Position3: A (known)
- Position4: L (known)
- Position5: A

If the secret word is ""koala"", then we get all ✓.

If not, then we get feedback on K and the last A.

But what if the secret word is, say, ""vocal""? But ""vocal"" doesn't fit the pattern? Because we need O in position2 and A in position3? ""vocal"" has O in position2, but A in position4? So it doesn't match.

So the only possibility is that the word has the pattern _ O A L _ and the missing letters are from the available set.

Another word: ""dhole""? D H O L E -> but E is excluded? and pattern: D(1), H(2), O(3), L(4), E(5) -> position2 is H? not O -> no.

I think ""koala"" is the best bet.

So I'll guess ""koala"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ROATE** → R(✗), O(✓), A(✓), T(✗), E(✗)  
  This reveals:  
  - O is in the word and **correctly positioned at index 2**.  
  - A is in the word and **correctly positioned at index 3**.  
  - R, T, and E are **not in the word**.

- **Guess 2: GOALS** → G(✗), O(✓), A(✓), L(✓), S(✗)  
  This reveals:  
  - O (position 2) and A (position 3) are confirmed correct (consistent with Guess 1).  
  - L is in the word and **correctly positioned at index 4**.  
  - G and S are **not in the word**.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the fixed pattern: `_ O A L _` (positions 2, 3, and 4 are confirmed as O, A, and L).
- Positions 1 and 5 are unknown.
- **Excluded letters**: R, T, E, G, S (all marked ✗ in previous guesses).
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: O, A, L (but we don't know if duplicates exist).
- Since O, A, and L are already placed correctly, the next guess should prioritize testing **new, common letters** in positions 1 and 5 to maximize information gain.
- After excluding used letters (R, O, A, T, E, G, L, S), the available letters for positions 1 and 5 include: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

### Analysis for Guess 3:
- The goal is to find a valid 5-letter word fitting `[1] O A L [5]`, using new letters to test positions 1 and 5.
- After evaluating possibilities, **KOALA** is the strongest guess:
  - **Fits the pattern**: K (position 1), O (position 2), A (position 3), L (position 4), A (position 5).
  - **Tests new letters**: 
    - **K** in position 1 (not previously tested).
    - **A** in position 5 (tests for a potential duplicate A; if marked ✓, it confirms two A's; if ✗, A is single-occurrence).
  - Avoids all excluded letters (R, T, E, G, S).
  - Provides critical feedback: A correct K in position 1 or a duplicate A would solve the word, while a ✗ on K or A narrows possibilities further.
- Other words like ""COALY"" (C O A L Y) were considered, but ""KOALA"" is more common and tests a duplicate letter scenario efficiently.",Guess 3: KOALA -> FEEDBACK: K(✓) O(✓) A(✓) L(✓) A(✓),SUCCESS
