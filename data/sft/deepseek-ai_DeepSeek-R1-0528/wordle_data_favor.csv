We are at the beginning of the game. There are no prior guesses to work from.
 Since it's the first guess, we want a word that can provide a lot of information. 
 The idea is to use a word that has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

 A popular starting word in such games is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 Another good one is ""SLATE"". Let me think about which one to choose.

 However, note that we are not limited to any particular strategy. But for maximum information, 
 we want to cover vowels and common consonants.

 Let me list out the vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We have 5 letters so we want at least 2 vowels.

 The word ""CRANE"" has: C, R, A, N, E -> vowels: A, E; consonants: C, R, N. 
 Similarly, ""SLATE"" has: S, L, A, T, E -> vowels: A, E; consonants: S, L, T.

 Both are good. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 Another candidate is ""ROATE"", but let's stick with a common word.

 So my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

 But note: We are trying to get as much information as possible. Let me also consider ""RAISE"". 
 ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E -> vowels: A, I, E; consonants: R, S. That has three vowels.

 However, I recall that ""CRANE"" is a standard first guess.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"".
</think>
<thinking>
For the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This typically involves using common letters (both vowels and consonants) to cover a broad range. A good starting word should include:
- Multiple vowels (like A, E, I) to test common vowel placements
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, N, C)
Avoiding repeated letters is also beneficial to test more letters.

A popular and effective starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it:
1. Contains three vowels (A and E) – though E is the only true vowel, A and E cover two of the most frequent vowels.
2. Includes common consonants (C, R, N).
3. Has no repeating letters.
4. Covers less common letters like C and N early, which can help eliminate possibilities.

Alternatives like ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also strong, but ""CRANE"" is mathematically strong based on word frequency analysis. Since this is the first guess, I'll start with ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- The letter R is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in position 2 and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position.

We also know the secret word must contain R and A, and does not contain C, N, E.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Must contain R and A (because they are present).
- The R cannot be in position 2 (because we already tried that and it was wrong position).
- The A cannot be in position 3.

Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think about possible positions for R and A.

Since R is not in position 2, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, A is not in position 3, so it could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but for now we assume no duplicates (unless feedback suggests otherwise).

We also want to avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

A good strategy is to try to place R and A in new positions and test other common letters.

Let's try to form a word that includes R and A, and three new letters.

We also want to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and A.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5

But note: we cannot have both R and A in the same position? No, because they are different.

We should try to put R in a position we haven't tested and similarly for A.

We tested R in position 2 and it was wrong, so we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, A was tested in position 3 and wrong, so we can try A in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to test other letters. Let's try to cover more vowels and common consonants.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

A good candidate might be a word that has R and A, and also S, T, or L.

Let me think of words that contain R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

For example:
- ""PARTY"" -> but has T and Y, but we don't know about T and Y. However, we are limited to 5 letters.

But note: we must use only English words.

Another idea: ""STARK"" -> S, T, A, R, K. But we have to place R and A in new positions.

In ""STARK"":
- A is in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So that's bad.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

So, let's list words with R and A, without C, N, E, and A not in position 3, R not in position 2.

Possible words:
- ""RADIO"": R in position 1, A in position 2. But we don't know about D, I, O. Also, we test I and O which are vowels. However, we have to avoid E, but I and O are new.
  - But note: we have R in position 1 (which we haven't tested) and A in position 2 (which we haven't tested for A). This seems good.

But wait, we also want to test more common consonants. ""RADIO"" has two vowels (A and I, O) and only one consonant (R, D). Maybe not the best for information.

- ""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S. 
  - A in position 2? That's allowed (since we only know A is not in 3). 
  - R in position 3? That's allowed (since we only know R is not in 2). 
  - Also, we test P, T, S which are common.

But let's check the positions: 
- P in 1, A in 2, R in 3, T in 4, S in 5.

We haven't tested position 1, 4, 5 at all. And we know A is not in 3, so position 2 is new for A. R is not in 2, so position 3 is new for R.

This seems good.

Another candidate: ""TRAIL"" -> T, R, A, I, L.
- T in 1, R in 2 -> but R in position 2 is not allowed because we already tried R in position 2 and it was present but wrong position? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again because it would be a waste. We must put R in a new position.

In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 again. That would be a mistake because we already know it's not there. So we avoid that.

Similarly, we cannot put A in position 3.

So ""TRAIL"" is invalid because R is in position 2.

Another word: ""ROAST"" -> R in 1, O in 2, A in 3? But A cannot be in position 3. So invalid.

""BRAVO"" -> B, R, A, V, O. 
- R in position 2? Again, we cannot put R in position 2. So invalid.

""FARTS"" -> F, A, R, T, S. 
- A in position 2? Allowed. 
- R in position 3? Allowed. 
- F, T, S are new.

But F is less common. Maybe not ideal.

""DARTS"" -> D, A, R, T, S. 
- A in 2, R in 3. 
- D, T, S are new.

Similarly, ""HARTS"" (if valid) but ""HARTS"" is not common. ""DARTS"" is common.

But we also have ""PARTS"" as I thought earlier.

Another one: ""WARTS"" -> W, A, R, T, S. 
- A in 2, R in 3.

W is less common.

So ""PARTS"" seems good: common letters P, A, R, T, S.

But note: we are not sure if P, T, S are in the word, but we are testing them.

We could also consider ""RASPY"": R in 1, A in 2, S in 3, P in 4, Y in 5. 
- A in 2 is allowed, R in 1 is allowed (we haven't tried position 1 for R). 
- But we are testing Y which is less common.

Another idea: ""SAFER"" -> S, A, F, E, R. But E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So invalid.

We must avoid E.

Similarly, ""CARET"" has C and E -> invalid.

So back to ""PARTS"": it has no forbidden letters and tests P, T, S.

But let me confirm: P, A, R, T, S.

Positions:
- P in 1: new
- A in 2: new for A (we only know A is not in 3, so 2 is untested)
- R in 3: new for R (we only know R is not in 2, so 3 is untested)
- T in 4: new
- S in 5: new

This will give us information about these positions and letters.

Another candidate: ""RANTS"" -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So invalid.

""MAILS"" -> but no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. And also A. So the word must have R and A.

So ""MAILS"" doesn't have R -> invalid.

We must include both R and A.

Another word: ""TARES"" -> but E is forbidden. Invalid.

""BARKS"" -> B, A, R, K, S. 
- A in 2? Allowed. 
- R in 3? Allowed. 
- B, K, S are new.

But K is less common than T or S? Maybe.

""PARKS"" -> similar.

But I think ""PARTS"" is better because T is more common than K.

We could also try to test a vowel. We haven't tested I, O, U.

For example, ""RAPID"": R in 1, A in 2, P in 3, I in 4, D in 5. 
- This tests I and D. 
- But we are not testing S or T.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to test as many common letters as possible.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E and N are out, so next are T, A (we have A), O, I, S, H, R (we have R), D, L, U.

So we should test T, O, I, S, etc.

In ""PARTS"", we test P, A (already known), R (known), T, S. So we are testing P, T, S.

P is not as common as T or S. T and S are very common.

Another word: ""STARS"" -> S, T, A, R, S. But it has duplicate S? And A is in position 3? Not allowed for A.

""ARTSY"" -> A in 1, R in 2? But R cannot be in position 2. So invalid.

""RATIO"": R in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, O in 5. 
- This tests T, I, O. 
- Positions: A in 2 (new), R in 1 (new), T in 3, I in 4, O in 5.

This tests three new vowels (I, O) and T (common consonant). And we avoid the forbidden positions.

This might be even better because we get information about vowels.

We know the word has A and R, but we don't know about vowels. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but likely.

In ""RATIO"", we have A, I, O as vowels and R, T as consonants.

This covers more vowels.

Alternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar but with D instead of T. T is more common than D.

So ""RATIO"" seems good.

But let me check: we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2. We haven't tested these positions for R and A.

We know R is in the word but not in position 2, so position 1 is a possibility. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so position 2 is a possibility.

So ""RATIO"" is a valid guess.

Another option: ""ORBIT"" -> but O in 1, R in 2? R in position 2 is not allowed. So invalid.

""TRIAD"": T, R, I, A, D. 
- R in position 2? Again, not allowed. Invalid.

So between ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"", which one?

""PARTS"" tests consonants: P, T, S (and known A, R)
""RATIO"" tests vowels: I, O and consonant T (and known A, R)

Since we have only tested one word and we don't know about vowels (we only know A is present, but there might be other vowels), testing two vowels (I and O) might be beneficial.

Also, T is a very common consonant.

Moreover, ""RATIO"" is a common word.

So I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice.

But note: we are not testing S, which is very common. But we can test S in the next guess if needed.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes S.

For example, ""RAINS"" -> but N is forbidden. Invalid.

""ROAST"" -> A in position 3? Not allowed.

""RASIS"" -> not a word.

""RASPS"" -> duplicate S and A in 2? But A in 2 is allowed, but duplicate S might not be ideal.

""RASPS"": R in 1, A in 2, S in 3, P in 4, S in 5. Duplicate S, which might not be efficient.

""TRAYS"" -> T, R, A, Y, S. But R in position 2? Not allowed.

""SATYR"" -> S, A, T, Y, R. 
- A in position 2? Allowed. 
- R in position 5? Allowed. 
- But Y is less common and the word is uncommon.

Not ideal.

""STAIR"" -> S, T, A, I, R. 
- A in position 3? Not allowed. Invalid.

""TAROT"" -> T, A, R, O, T. 
- A in position 2? Allowed. 
- R in position 3? Allowed. 
- But duplicate T? And O is a vowel.

But duplicate T might not be good.

So ""RATIO"" seems a solid choice.

Another one: ""AUDIO"" -> but no R? We must include R. So invalid.

Therefore, I will go with ""RATIO"".

So the second guess is ""RATIO"".
</think>
<thinking>
We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions guessed (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
2. The letters C, N, and E are absent from the secret word.
3. For the next guess:
   - Must include R and A (since they are confirmed present).
   - Avoid C, N, E.
   - R cannot be in position 2 (already tested and wrong).
   - A cannot be in position 3 (already tested and wrong).
   - Should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, O, S) to gather more information.

Strategy for the second guess:
- Choose a word with R and A in new positions (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
- Include other high-frequency letters not yet tested (like T, I, O) to maximize information gain.
- Avoid letters known to be absent (C, N, E).

After evaluating options:
- ""RATIO"" is a strong candidate because:
  - Contains R (position 1) and A (position 2), both in new untested positions.
  - Tests new common letters: T (position 3), I (position 4), O (position 5).
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E).
  - Provides broad coverage of vowels (A, I, O) and consonants (R, T).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing three new letters.

<guess>RATIO</guess>",RATIO,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- The letter R is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in position 2 and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position.

We also know the secret word must contain R and A, and does not contain C, N, E.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Must contain R and A (because they are present).
- The R cannot be in position 2 (because we already tried that and it was wrong position).
- The A cannot be in position 3.

Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think about possible positions for R and A.

Since R is not in position 2, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, A is not in position 3, so it could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but for now we assume no duplicates (unless feedback suggests otherwise).

We also want to avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

A good strategy is to try to place R and A in new positions and test other common letters.

Let's try to form a word that includes R and A, and three new letters.

We also want to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and A.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5

But note: we cannot have both R and A in the same position? No, because they are different.

We should try to put R in a position we haven't tested and similarly for A.

We tested R in position 2 and it was wrong, so we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, A was tested in position 3 and wrong, so we can try A in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to test other letters. Let's try to cover more vowels and common consonants.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

A good candidate might be a word that has R and A, and also S, T, or L.

Let me think of words that contain R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

For example:
- ""PARTY"" -> but has T and Y, but we don't know about T and Y. However, we are limited to 5 letters.

But note: we must use only English words.

Another idea: ""STARK"" -> S, T, A, R, K. But we have to place R and A in new positions.

In ""STARK"":
- A is in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So that's bad.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

So, let's list words with R and A, without C, N, E, and A not in position 3, R not in position 2.

Possible words:
- ""RADIO"": R in position 1, A in position 2. But we don't know about D, I, O. Also, we test I and O which are vowels. However, we have to avoid E, but I and O are new.
  - But note: we have R in position 1 (which we haven't tested) and A in position 2 (which we haven't tested for A). This seems good.

But wait, we also want to test more common consonants. ""RADIO"" has two vowels (A and I, O) and only one consonant (R, D). Maybe not the best for information.

- ""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S. 
  - A in position 2? That's allowed (since we only know A is not in 3). 
  - R in position 3? That's allowed (since we only know R is not in 2). 
  - Also, we test P, T, S which are common.

But let's check the positions: 
- P in 1, A in 2, R in 3, T in 4, S in 5.

We haven't tested position 1, 4, 5 at all. And we know A is not in 3, so position 2 is new for A. R is not in 2, so position 3 is new for R.

This seems good.

Another candidate: ""TRAIL"" -> T, R, A, I, L.
- T in 1, R in 2 -> but R in position 2 is not allowed because we already tried R in position 2 and it was present but wrong position? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again because it would be a waste. We must put R in a new position.

In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 again. That would be a mistake because we already know it's not there. So we avoid that.

Similarly, we cannot put A in position 3.

So ""TRAIL"" is invalid because R is in position 2.

Another word: ""ROAST"" -> R in 1, O in 2, A in 3? But A cannot be in position 3. So invalid.

""BRAVO"" -> B, R, A, V, O. 
- R in position 2? Again, we cannot put R in position 2. So invalid.

""FARTS"" -> F, A, R, T, S. 
- A in position 2? Allowed. 
- R in position 3? Allowed. 
- F, T, S are new.

But F is less common. Maybe not ideal.

""DARTS"" -> D, A, R, T, S. 
- A in 2, R in 3. 
- D, T, S are new.

Similarly, ""HARTS"" (if valid) but ""HARTS"" is not common. ""DARTS"" is common.

But we also have ""PARTS"" as I thought earlier.

Another one: ""WARTS"" -> W, A, R, T, S. 
- A in 2, R in 3.

W is less common.

So ""PARTS"" seems good: common letters P, A, R, T, S.

But note: we are not sure if P, T, S are in the word, but we are testing them.

We could also consider ""RASPY"": R in 1, A in 2, S in 3, P in 4, Y in 5. 
- A in 2 is allowed, R in 1 is allowed (we haven't tried position 1 for R). 
- But we are testing Y which is less common.

Another idea: ""SAFER"" -> S, A, F, E, R. But E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So invalid.

We must avoid E.

Similarly, ""CARET"" has C and E -> invalid.

So back to ""PARTS"": it has no forbidden letters and tests P, T, S.

But let me confirm: P, A, R, T, S.

Positions:
- P in 1: new
- A in 2: new for A (we only know A is not in 3, so 2 is untested)
- R in 3: new for R (we only know R is not in 2, so 3 is untested)
- T in 4: new
- S in 5: new

This will give us information about these positions and letters.

Another candidate: ""RANTS"" -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So invalid.

""MAILS"" -> but no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. And also A. So the word must have R and A.

So ""MAILS"" doesn't have R -> invalid.

We must include both R and A.

Another word: ""TARES"" -> but E is forbidden. Invalid.

""BARKS"" -> B, A, R, K, S. 
- A in 2? Allowed. 
- R in 3? Allowed. 
- B, K, S are new.

But K is less common than T or S? Maybe.

""PARKS"" -> similar.

But I think ""PARTS"" is better because T is more common than K.

We could also try to test a vowel. We haven't tested I, O, U.

For example, ""RAPID"": R in 1, A in 2, P in 3, I in 4, D in 5. 
- This tests I and D. 
- But we are not testing S or T.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to test as many common letters as possible.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E and N are out, so next are T, A (we have A), O, I, S, H, R (we have R), D, L, U.

So we should test T, O, I, S, etc.

In ""PARTS"", we test P, A (already known), R (known), T, S. So we are testing P, T, S.

P is not as common as T or S. T and S are very common.

Another word: ""STARS"" -> S, T, A, R, S. But it has duplicate S? And A is in position 3? Not allowed for A.

""ARTSY"" -> A in 1, R in 2? But R cannot be in position 2. So invalid.

""RATIO"": R in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, O in 5. 
- This tests T, I, O. 
- Positions: A in 2 (new), R in 1 (new), T in 3, I in 4, O in 5.

This tests three new vowels (I, O) and T (common consonant). And we avoid the forbidden positions.

This might be even better because we get information about vowels.

We know the word has A and R, but we don't know about vowels. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but likely.

In ""RATIO"", we have A, I, O as vowels and R, T as consonants.

This covers more vowels.

Alternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar but with D instead of T. T is more common than D.

So ""RATIO"" seems good.

But let me check: we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2. We haven't tested these positions for R and A.

We know R is in the word but not in position 2, so position 1 is a possibility. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so position 2 is a possibility.

So ""RATIO"" is a valid guess.

Another option: ""ORBIT"" -> but O in 1, R in 2? R in position 2 is not allowed. So invalid.

""TRIAD"": T, R, I, A, D. 
- R in position 2? Again, not allowed. Invalid.

So between ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"", which one?

""PARTS"" tests consonants: P, T, S (and known A, R)
""RATIO"" tests vowels: I, O and consonant T (and known A, R)

Since we have only tested one word and we don't know about vowels (we only know A is present, but there might be other vowels), testing two vowels (I and O) might be beneficial.

Also, T is a very common consonant.

Moreover, ""RATIO"" is a common word.

So I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice.

But note: we are not testing S, which is very common. But we can test S in the next guess if needed.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes S.

For example, ""RAINS"" -> but N is forbidden. Invalid.

""ROAST"" -> A in position 3? Not allowed.

""RASIS"" -> not a word.

""RASPS"" -> duplicate S and A in 2? But A in 2 is allowed, but duplicate S might not be ideal.

""RASPS"": R in 1, A in 2, S in 3, P in 4, S in 5. Duplicate S, which might not be efficient.

""TRAYS"" -> T, R, A, Y, S. But R in position 2? Not allowed.

""SATYR"" -> S, A, T, Y, R. 
- A in position 2? Allowed. 
- R in position 5? Allowed. 
- But Y is less common and the word is uncommon.

Not ideal.

""STAIR"" -> S, T, A, I, R. 
- A in position 3? Not allowed. Invalid.

""TAROT"" -> T, A, R, O, T. 
- A in position 2? Allowed. 
- R in position 3? Allowed. 
- But duplicate T? And O is a vowel.

But duplicate T might not be good.

So ""RATIO"" seems a solid choice.

Another one: ""AUDIO"" -> but no R? We must include R. So invalid.

Therefore, I will go with ""RATIO"".

So the second guess is ""RATIO"".<thinking>
We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions guessed (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
2. The letters C, N, and E are absent from the secret word.
3. For the next guess:
   - Must include R and A (since they are confirmed present).
   - Avoid C, N, E.
   - R cannot be in position 2 (already tested and wrong).
   - A cannot be in position 3 (already tested and wrong).
   - Should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, O, S) to gather more information.

Strategy for the second guess:
- Choose a word with R and A in new positions (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
- Include other high-frequency letters not yet tested (like T, I, O) to maximize information gain.
- Avoid letters known to be absent (C, N, E).

After evaluating options:
- ""RATIO"" is a strong candidate because:
  - Contains R (position 1) and A (position 2), both in new untested positions.
  - Tests new common letters: T (position 3), I (position 4), O (position 5).
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E).
  - Provides broad coverage of vowels (A, I, O) and consonants (R, T).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing three new letters.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the beginning of the game. There are no prior guesses to work from.
 Since it's the first guess, we want a word that can provide a lot of information. 
 The idea is to use a word that has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

 A popular starting word in such games is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 Another good one is ""SLATE"". Let me think about which one to choose.

 However, note that we are not limited to any particular strategy. But for maximum information, 
 we want to cover vowels and common consonants.

 Let me list out the vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We have 5 letters so we want at least 2 vowels.

 The word ""CRANE"" has: C, R, A, N, E -> vowels: A, E; consonants: C, R, N. 
 Similarly, ""SLATE"" has: S, L, A, T, E -> vowels: A, E; consonants: S, L, T.

 Both are good. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 Another candidate is ""ROATE"", but let's stick with a common word.

 So my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

 But note: We are trying to get as much information as possible. Let me also consider ""RAISE"". 
 ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E -> vowels: A, I, E; consonants: R, S. That has three vowels.

 However, I recall that ""CRANE"" is a standard first guess.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"".<thinking>
For the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This typically involves using common letters (both vowels and consonants) to cover a broad range. A good starting word should include:
- Multiple vowels (like A, E, I) to test common vowel placements
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, N, C)
Avoiding repeated letters is also beneficial to test more letters.

A popular and effective starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it:
1. Contains three vowels (A and E) – though E is the only true vowel, A and E cover two of the most frequent vowels.
2. Includes common consonants (C, R, N).
3. Has no repeating letters.
4. Covers less common letters like C and N early, which can help eliminate possibilities.

Alternatives like ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also strong, but ""CRANE"" is mathematically strong based on word frequency analysis. Since this is the first guess, I'll start with ""CRANE"".
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- The letter R is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in position 2 and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position.

We also know the secret word must contain R and A, and does not contain C, N, E.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Must contain R and A (because they are present).
- The R cannot be in position 2 (because we already tried that and it was wrong position).
- The A cannot be in position 3.

Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think about possible positions for R and A.

Since R is not in position 2, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, A is not in position 3, so it could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but for now we assume no duplicates (unless feedback suggests otherwise).

We also want to avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

A good strategy is to try to place R and A in new positions and test other common letters.

Let's try to form a word that includes R and A, and three new letters.

We also want to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and A.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5

But note: we cannot have both R and A in the same position? No, because they are different.

We should try to put R in a position we haven't tested and similarly for A.

We tested R in position 2 and it was wrong, so we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, A was tested in position 3 and wrong, so we can try A in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to test other letters. Let's try to cover more vowels and common consonants.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

A good candidate might be a word that has R and A, and also S, T, or L.

Let me think of words that contain R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

For example:
- ""PARTY"" -> but has T and Y, but we don't know about T and Y. However, we are limited to 5 letters.

But note: we must use only English words.

Another idea: ""STARK"" -> S, T, A, R, K. But we have to place R and A in new positions.

In ""STARK"":
- A is in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So that's bad.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

So, let's list words with R and A, without C, N, E, and A not in position 3, R not in position 2.

Possible words:
- ""RADIO"": R in position 1, A in position 2. But we don't know about D, I, O. Also, we test I and O which are vowels. However, we have to avoid E, but I and O are new.
  - But note: we have R in position 1 (which we haven't tested) and A in position 2 (which we haven't tested for A). This seems good.

But wait, we also want to test more common consonants. ""RADIO"" has two vowels (A and I, O) and only one consonant (R, D). Maybe not the best for information.

- ""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S. 
  - A in position 2? That's allowed (since we only know A is not in 3). 
  - R in position 3? That's allowed (since we only know R is not in 2). 
  - Also, we test P, T, S which are common.

But let's check the positions: 
- P in 1, A in 2, R in 3, T in 4, S in 5.

We haven't tested position 1, 4, 5 at all. And we know A is not in 3, so position 2 is new for A. R is not in 2, so position 3 is new for R.

This seems good.

Another candidate: ""TRAIL"" -> T, R, A, I, L.
- T in 1, R in 2 -> but R in position 2 is not allowed because we already tried R in position 2 and it was present but wrong position? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again because it would be a waste. We must put R in a new position.

In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 again. That would be a mistake because we already know it's not there. So we avoid that.

Similarly, we cannot put A in position 3.

So ""TRAIL"" is invalid because R is in position 2.

Another word: ""ROAST"" -> R in 1, O in 2, A in 3? But A cannot be in position 3. So invalid.

""BRAVO"" -> B, R, A, V, O. 
- R in position 2? Again, we cannot put R in position 2. So invalid.

""FARTS"" -> F, A, R, T, S. 
- A in position 2? Allowed. 
- R in position 3? Allowed. 
- F, T, S are new.

But F is less common. Maybe not ideal.

""DARTS"" -> D, A, R, T, S. 
- A in 2, R in 3. 
- D, T, S are new.

Similarly, ""HARTS"" (if valid) but ""HARTS"" is not common. ""DARTS"" is common.

But we also have ""PARTS"" as I thought earlier.

Another one: ""WARTS"" -> W, A, R, T, S. 
- A in 2, R in 3.

W is less common.

So ""PARTS"" seems good: common letters P, A, R, T, S.

But note: we are not sure if P, T, S are in the word, but we are testing them.

We could also consider ""RASPY"": R in 1, A in 2, S in 3, P in 4, Y in 5. 
- A in 2 is allowed, R in 1 is allowed (we haven't tried position 1 for R). 
- But we are testing Y which is less common.

Another idea: ""SAFER"" -> S, A, F, E, R. But E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So invalid.

We must avoid E.

Similarly, ""CARET"" has C and E -> invalid.

So back to ""PARTS"": it has no forbidden letters and tests P, T, S.

But let me confirm: P, A, R, T, S.

Positions:
- P in 1: new
- A in 2: new for A (we only know A is not in 3, so 2 is untested)
- R in 3: new for R (we only know R is not in 2, so 3 is untested)
- T in 4: new
- S in 5: new

This will give us information about these positions and letters.

Another candidate: ""RANTS"" -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So invalid.

""MAILS"" -> but no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. And also A. So the word must have R and A.

So ""MAILS"" doesn't have R -> invalid.

We must include both R and A.

Another word: ""TARES"" -> but E is forbidden. Invalid.

""BARKS"" -> B, A, R, K, S. 
- A in 2? Allowed. 
- R in 3? Allowed. 
- B, K, S are new.

But K is less common than T or S? Maybe.

""PARKS"" -> similar.

But I think ""PARTS"" is better because T is more common than K.

We could also try to test a vowel. We haven't tested I, O, U.

For example, ""RAPID"": R in 1, A in 2, P in 3, I in 4, D in 5. 
- This tests I and D. 
- But we are not testing S or T.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to test as many common letters as possible.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E and N are out, so next are T, A (we have A), O, I, S, H, R (we have R), D, L, U.

So we should test T, O, I, S, etc.

In ""PARTS"", we test P, A (already known), R (known), T, S. So we are testing P, T, S.

P is not as common as T or S. T and S are very common.

Another word: ""STARS"" -> S, T, A, R, S. But it has duplicate S? And A is in position 3? Not allowed for A.

""ARTSY"" -> A in 1, R in 2? But R cannot be in position 2. So invalid.

""RATIO"": R in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, O in 5. 
- This tests T, I, O. 
- Positions: A in 2 (new), R in 1 (new), T in 3, I in 4, O in 5.

This tests three new vowels (I, O) and T (common consonant). And we avoid the forbidden positions.

This might be even better because we get information about vowels.

We know the word has A and R, but we don't know about vowels. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but likely.

In ""RATIO"", we have A, I, O as vowels and R, T as consonants.

This covers more vowels.

Alternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar but with D instead of T. T is more common than D.

So ""RATIO"" seems good.

But let me check: we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2. We haven't tested these positions for R and A.

We know R is in the word but not in position 2, so position 1 is a possibility. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so position 2 is a possibility.

So ""RATIO"" is a valid guess.

Another option: ""ORBIT"" -> but O in 1, R in 2? R in position 2 is not allowed. So invalid.

""TRIAD"": T, R, I, A, D. 
- R in position 2? Again, not allowed. Invalid.

So between ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"", which one?

""PARTS"" tests consonants: P, T, S (and known A, R)
""RATIO"" tests vowels: I, O and consonant T (and known A, R)

Since we have only tested one word and we don't know about vowels (we only know A is present, but there might be other vowels), testing two vowels (I and O) might be beneficial.

Also, T is a very common consonant.

Moreover, ""RATIO"" is a common word.

So I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice.

But note: we are not testing S, which is very common. But we can test S in the next guess if needed.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes S.

For example, ""RAINS"" -> but N is forbidden. Invalid.

""ROAST"" -> A in position 3? Not allowed.

""RASIS"" -> not a word.

""RASPS"" -> duplicate S and A in 2? But A in 2 is allowed, but duplicate S might not be ideal.

""RASPS"": R in 1, A in 2, S in 3, P in 4, S in 5. Duplicate S, which might not be efficient.

""TRAYS"" -> T, R, A, Y, S. But R in position 2? Not allowed.

""SATYR"" -> S, A, T, Y, R. 
- A in position 2? Allowed. 
- R in position 5? Allowed. 
- But Y is less common and the word is uncommon.

Not ideal.

""STAIR"" -> S, T, A, I, R. 
- A in position 3? Not allowed. Invalid.

""TAROT"" -> T, A, R, O, T. 
- A in position 2? Allowed. 
- R in position 3? Allowed. 
- But duplicate T? And O is a vowel.

But duplicate T might not be good.

So ""RATIO"" seems a solid choice.

Another one: ""AUDIO"" -> but no R? We must include R. So invalid.

Therefore, I will go with ""RATIO"".

So the second guess is ""RATIO"".<thinking>
We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions guessed (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
2. The letters C, N, and E are absent from the secret word.
3. For the next guess:
   - Must include R and A (since they are confirmed present).
   - Avoid C, N, E.
   - R cannot be in position 2 (already tested and wrong).
   - A cannot be in position 3 (already tested and wrong).
   - Should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, O, S) to gather more information.

Strategy for the second guess:
- Choose a word with R and A in new positions (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
- Include other high-frequency letters not yet tested (like T, I, O) to maximize information gain.
- Avoid letters known to be absent (C, N, E).

After evaluating options:
- ""RATIO"" is a strong candidate because:
  - Contains R (position 1) and A (position 2), both in new untested positions.
  - Tests new common letters: T (position 3), I (position 4), O (position 5).
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E).
  - Provides broad coverage of vowels (A, I, O) and consonants (R, T).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing three new letters.

There are no prior guesses to work from.\n Since it\'s the first guess, we want a word that can provide a lot of information. \n The idea is to use a word that has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.\n\n A popular starting word in such games is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n Another good one is ""SLATE"". Let me think about which one to choose.\n\n However, note that we are not limited to any particular strategy. But for maximum information, \n we want to cover vowels and common consonants.\n\n Let me list out the vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We have 5 letters so we want at least 2 vowels.\n\n The word ""CRANE"" has: C, R, A, N, E -> vowels: A, E; consonants: C, R, N. \n Similarly, ""SLATE"" has: S, L, A, T, E -> vowels: A, E; consonants: S, L, T.\n\n Both are good.

That has three vowels.\n\n However, I recall that ""CRANE"" is a standard first guess.\n\n Let me choose ""CRANE"".<thinking>\nFor the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This typically involves using common letters (both vowels and consonants) to cover a broad range. A good starting word should include:\n- Multiple vowels (like A, E, I) to test common vowel placements\n- Common consonants (like R, S, T, N, C)\nAvoiding repeated letters is also beneficial to test more letters.\n\nA popular and effective starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it:\n1. Contains three vowels (A and E) – though E is the only true vowel, A and E cover two of the most frequent vowels.\n2. Includes common consonants (C, R, N).\n3. Has no repeating letters.\n4. Covers less common letters like C and N early, which can help eliminate possibilities.\n\nAlternatives like ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also strong, but ""CRANE"" is mathematically strong based on word frequency analysis. Since this is the first guess, I\'ll start with ""CRANE"".\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.\n- The letter R is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in position 2 and got a \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not there).\n- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position.\n\nWe also know the secret word must contain R and A, and does not contain C, N, E.\n\nWe have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.\n\nWe need to choose a new 5-letter word that:\n- Does not contain C, N, E (since they are not in the word).\n- Must contain R and A (because they are present).\n- The R cannot be in position 2 (because we already tried that and it was wrong position).\n- The A cannot be in position 3.\n\nMoreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\nLet\'s think about possible positions for R and A.\n\nSince R is not in position 2, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\nSimilarly, A is not in position 3, so it could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters, but for now we assume no duplicates (unless feedback suggests otherwise).\n\nWe also want to avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C, N, E.\n\nCommon letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.\n\nA good strategy is to try to place R and A in new positions and test other common letters.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word that includes R and A, and three new letters.\n\nWe also want to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and A.\n\nPossible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5\nPossible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5\n\nBut note: we cannot have both R and A in the same position?

However, we are limited to 5 letters.\n\nBut note: we must use only English words.\n\nAnother idea: ""STARK"" -> S, T, A, R, K. But we have to place R and A in new positions.\n\nIn ""STARK"":\n- A is in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So that\'s bad.\n\nWe need to avoid position 3 for A.\n\nSo, let\'s list words with R and A, without C, N, E, and A not in position 3, R not in position 2.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""RADIO"": R in position 1, A in position 2. But we don\'t know about D, I, O. Also, we test I and O which are vowels. However, we have to avoid E, but I and O are new.\n  - But note: we have R in position 1 (which we haven\'t tested) and A in position 2 (which we haven\'t tested for A). This seems good.\n\nBut wait, we also want to test more common consonants. ""RADIO"" has two vowels (A and I, O) and only one consonant (R, D). Maybe not the best for information.\n\n- ""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S. \n  - A in position 2? That\'s allowed (since we only know A is not in 3). \n  - R in position 3? That\'s allowed (since we only know R is not in 2). \n  - Also, we test P, T, S which are common.\n\nBut let\'s check the positions: \n- P in 1, A in 2, R in 3, T in 4, S in 5.\n\nWe haven\'t tested position 1, 4, 5 at all. And we know A is not in 3, so position 2 is new for A. R is not in 2, so position 3 is new for R.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TRAIL"" -> T, R, A, I, L.\n- T in 1, R in 2 -> but R in position 2 is not allowed because we already tried R in position 2 and it was present but wrong position? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again because it would be a waste. We must put R in a new position.\n\nIn ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 again. That would be a mistake because we already know it\'s not there. So we avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put A in position 3.\n\nSo ""TRAIL"" is invalid because R is in position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""ROAST"" -> R in 1, O in 2, A in 3? But A cannot be in position 3. So invalid.\n\n""BRAVO"" -> B, R, A, V, O. \n- R in position 2? Again, we cannot put R in position 2. So invalid.\n\n""FARTS"" -> F, A, R, T, S. \n- A in position 2? Allowed. \n- R in position 3? Allowed. \n- F, T, S are new.\n\nBut F is less common. Maybe not ideal.\n\n""DARTS"" -> D, A, R, T, S. \n- A in 2, R in 3. \n- D, T, S are new.\n\nSimilarly, ""HARTS"" (if valid) but ""HARTS"" is not common. ""DARTS"" is common.\n\nBut we also have ""PARTS"" as I thought earlier.\n\nAnother one: ""WARTS"" -> W, A, R, T, S. \n- A in 2, R in 3.\n\nW is less common.\n\nSo ""PARTS"" seems good: common letters P, A, R, T, S.\n\nBut note: we are not sure if P, T, S are in the word, but we are testing them.\n\nWe could also consider ""RASPY"": R in 1, A in 2, S in 3, P in 4, Y in 5. \n- A in 2 is allowed, R in 1 is allowed (we haven\'t tried position 1 for R). \n- But we are testing Y which is less common.\n\nAnother idea: ""SAFER"" -> S, A, F, E, R. But E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So invalid.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARET"" has C and E -> invalid.\n\nSo back to ""PARTS"": it has no forbidden letters and tests P, T, S.\n\nBut let me confirm: P, A, R, T, S.\n\nPositions:\n- P in 1: new\n- A in 2: new for A (we only know A is not in 3, so 2 is untested)\n- R in 3: new for R (we only know R is not in 2, so 3 is untested)\n- T in 4: new\n- S in 5: new\n\nThis will give us information about these positions and letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""RANTS"" -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n""MAILS"" -> but no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. And also A. So the word must have R and A.\n\nSo ""MAILS"" doesn\'t have R -> invalid.\n\nWe must include both R and A.\n\nAnother word: ""TARES"" -> but E is forbidden. Invalid.\n\n""BARKS"" -> B, A, R, K, S. \n- A in 2? Allowed. \n- R in 3? Allowed. \n- B, K, S are new.\n\nBut K is less common than T or S? Maybe.\n\n""PARKS"" -> similar.\n\nBut I think ""PARTS"" is better because T is more common than K.\n\nWe could also try to test a vowel. We haven\'t tested I, O, U.\n\nFor example, ""RAPID"": R in 1, A in 2, P in 3, I in 4, D in 5. \n- This tests I and D. \n- But we are not testing S or T.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we want to test as many common letters as possible.\n\nThe most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E and N are out, so next are T, A (we have A), O, I, S, H, R (we have R), D, L, U.\n\nSo we should test T, O, I, S, etc.\n\nIn ""PARTS"", we test P, A (already known), R (known), T, S. So we are testing P, T, S.\n\nP is not as common as T or S. T and S are very common.\n\nAnother word: ""STARS"" -> S, T, A, R, S. But it has duplicate S? And A is in position 3? Not allowed for A.\n\n""ARTSY"" -> A in 1, R in 2? But R cannot be in position 2. So invalid.\n\n""RATIO"": R in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, O in 5. \n- This tests T, I, O. \n- Positions: A in 2 (new), R in 1 (new), T in 3, I in 4, O in 5.\n\nThis tests three new vowels (I, O) and T (common consonant). And we avoid the forbidden positions.\n\nThis might be even better because we get information about vowels.\n\nWe know the word has A and R, but we don\'t know about vowels. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but likely.\n\nIn ""RATIO"", we have A, I, O as vowels and R, T as consonants.\n\nThis covers more vowels.\n\nAlternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar but with D instead of T. T is more common than D.\n\nSo ""RATIO"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check: we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2. We haven\'t tested these positions for R and A.\n\nWe know R is in the word but not in position 2, so position 1 is a possibility. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so position 2 is a possibility.\n\nSo ""RATIO"" is a valid guess.\n\nAnother option: ""ORBIT"" -> but O in 1, R in 2? R in position 2 is not allowed. So invalid.\n\n""TRIAD"": T, R, I, A, D. \n- R in position 2? Again, not allowed. Invalid.\n\nSo between ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"", which one?\n\n""PARTS"" tests consonants: P, T, S (and known A, R)\n""RATIO"" tests vowels: I, O and consonant T (and known A, R)\n\nSince we have only tested one word and we don\'t know about vowels (we only know A is present, but there might be other vowels), testing two vowels (I and O) might be beneficial.\n\nAlso, T is a very common consonant.\n\nMoreover, ""RATIO"" is a common word.\n\nSo I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: we are not testing S, which is very common. But we can test S in the next guess if needed.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that includes S.\n\nFor example, ""RAINS"" -> but N is forbidden. Invalid.\n\n""ROAST"" -> A in position 3? Not allowed.\n\n""RASIS"" -> not a word.\n\n""RASPS"" -> duplicate S and A in 2? But A in 2 is allowed, but duplicate S might not be ideal.\n\n""RASPS"": R in 1, A in 2, S in 3, P in 4, S in 5. Duplicate S, which might not be efficient.\n\n""TRAYS"" -> T, R, A, Y, S. But R in position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""SATYR"" -> S, A, T, Y, R. \n- A in position 2? Allowed. \n- R in position 5? Allowed. \n- But Y is less common and the word is uncommon.\n\nNot ideal.\n\n""STAIR"" -> S, T, A, I, R. \n- A in position 3? Not allowed. Invalid.\n\n""TAROT"" -> T, A, R, O, T. \n- A in position 2? Allowed. \n- R in position 3? Allowed. \n- But duplicate T? And O is a vowel.\n\nBut duplicate T might not be good.\n\nSo ""RATIO"" seems a solid choice.\n\nAnother one: ""AUDIO"" -> but no R? We must include R. So invalid.\n\nTherefore, I will go with ""RATIO"".\n\nSo the second guess is ""RATIO"".<thinking>\nWe have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": \n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nKey insights:\n1.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: RATIO
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 1)  [since we guessed R in position 1 and got '-']
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- T: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

So, from this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter A in position 2 (because A in ""RATIO"" was correct).
2. The letter R is in the word, but not in position 1 or 2 (since we tried position 1 in the second guess and it was wrong, and position 2 in the first guess was also wrong).
3. The letter O is in the word, but not in position 5.
4. The letters C, N, E, T, I are not in the word.

Also, from the first guess, we know R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3, but now we know A is fixed in position 2.

So, to summarize:

- Position 2 is A.

Letters in the word: A (in pos 2), R (somewhere, but not pos 1 or 2), O (somewhere, not pos 5).

Letters not in the word: C, N, E, T, I.

We have 5 positions: _ A _ _ _

R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5 (since not 1 or 2).

O must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4 (since not 5).

We need to make a third guess. We should try to find a word that:

- Has A in position 2 (fixed).
- Includes R and O (since they are in the word, and we need to find their positions).
- Avoids C, N, E, T, I.
- Tests new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R: 3,4,5
Possible positions for O: 1,3,4

But note: if we put O in position 3 or 4, and R in position 3 or 4, they might conflict? But they are different letters, so they can be in the same word.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried. The letters we haven't tried and are common: S, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using letters we know are not in the word.

Let's list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, N, E, T, I, and also we know A, R, O are in the word, so we must include them.

The word must have A in position 2, and also R and O.

So the word pattern: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With:
- letter1: can be any except C, N, E, T, I, and must be a letter we haven't ruled out. Also, O could be here.
- letter3: can be R or O or a new letter, but note R and O must be placed somewhere. Also, we know A is not in position 3 (from first guess, but now we have A in 2, so position 3 is open). But we must place R and O in the remaining positions: 1,3,4,5, but with constraints: R not in 1, O not in 5, and R must be in 3,4,5 and O in 1,3,4.

So the positions for R and O must be assigned to three positions: 1,3,4,5, but with:
- R: 3,4,5
- O: 1,3,4

So position 1 can only be O (if O is there) or a new letter? But O can be in 1, so if O is in 1, then R must be in 3,4, or 5. If O is in 3, then R can be in 4 or 5 (since 3 is taken). Similarly, if O is in 4, R can be in 3 or 5.

We also have to fill the remaining positions with new letters that are not forbidden.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to test R and O in positions that are possible and also test new common letters.

Let's think of words that fit: [O?] A [R? or O?] [R? or O?] [R?]

For example:
- If we put O in position 1: then word starts with O, then A in 2, then we need to place R in 3,4, or 5, and the other two positions with new letters.

But we don't know if O is in position 1.

Similarly, we could put R in position 3, etc.

We should consider common words.

List of possible words with A in position 2 and containing R and O, without C, N, E, T, I.

Common letters to try: S, L, D, M, P, U, etc.

For example:
- ""OASIS"" -> but has S and I? I is forbidden. Also, duplicate S? And we don't know about S. But I is not allowed.

I is forbidden, so we cannot use I.

Similarly, ""OAKUM"" -> but K and U? And no R? We need R.

We must have R.

""ROARS"" -> but R in position 1? We know R cannot be in position 1 (from second guess feedback: R in position 1 was wrong). Also, A in position 3? But we have A fixed in position 2, so not.

We have A in position 2, so the word must be ? A ? ? ?

""PAROL"" -> P, A, R, O, L. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: possible (since R can be in 3,4,5)
- O in 4: possible (O can be in 1,3,4, but here in 4)
- L in 5: new letter.
- But we have P in 1: new letter.

This word: P A R O L

Check the letters: P, A, R, O, L. We know A, R, O are in the word. P and L are new.

Also, avoids C, N, E, T, I.

This seems good.

Another word: ""CAROL"" -> but C is forbidden. Invalid.

""MARSH"" -> M, A, R, S, H. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: good.
- But no O? We must include O. So invalid.

We must include O.

""FARGO"" -> F, A, R, G, O. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: good.
- O in 5: but O cannot be in position 5? From feedback, O is not in position 5 (from second guess, O in position 5 was wrong). So O cannot be in 5. Therefore, ""FARGO"" has O in 5 -> invalid.

""DOGMA"" -> D, O, G, M, A. But A is in position 5, not 2. We need A in position 2. Invalid.

""LOAMY"" -> L, O, A, M, Y. A in position 3? Not 2. Invalid.

Back to ""PAROL"": P A R O L.

Positions:
- P in 1: new
- A in 2: correct (we know)
- R in 3: we are testing R in position 3 (which is possible)
- O in 4: testing O in position 4 (possible, since O not in 5)
- L in 5: new

This tests P and L, and also checks if R is in 3 and O in 4.

But what if R is not in 3? We might get feedback that R is elsewhere.

Another possibility: ""OARED"" -> but E is forbidden. Invalid.

""SOAPY"" -> S, O, A, P, Y. 
- O in 1: possible (O can be in 1)
- A in 3? But we need A in 2. Here A is in 3 -> invalid.

""BOARS"" -> B, O, A, R, S. 
- O in 1: possible
- A in 3? Not 2. Invalid.

""ROAMS"" -> R, O, A, M, S. 
- R in 1: but R cannot be in position 1 (we tried and it was wrong). So invalid.

""OAKER"" -> not common, and R in 5? But O in 1, A in 2? Then K, E, R? E forbidden.

""PARKA"" -> P, A, R, K, A. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: good.
- But duplicate A? And no O? We need O. Invalid.

""GATOR"" -> G, A, T, O, R. 
- A in 2: good.
- T: but T is forbidden (from second guess, T is not in the word). So invalid.

""MAJOR"" -> M, A, J, O, R.

- A in 2: correct
- J in 3: new
- O in 4: testing O in 4
- R in 5: testing R in 5

But J is not a common letter, so it might not be efficient for information.

Similarly, ""VALOR"" -> V, A, L, O, R. 
- A in 2: good.
- V in 1: new
- L in 3: new
- O in 4: good
- R in 5: good

This tests V and L.

""VALOR"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""PALOR"" is not a word.

""RADON"" -> N forbidden.

So ""VALOR"" seems good: V, A, L, O, R.

But we have O in position 4 and R in position 5.

We know O cannot be in position 5, but position 4 is allowed. R in position 5 is allowed (since we haven't tried position 5 for R).

Another word: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R. But N is forbidden. Invalid.

""LABOR"" -> L, A, B, O, R. 
- A in 2: good.
- B in 3: new
- O in 4: good
- R in 5: good

This tests L and B.

But B is less common than some other letters.

""SAVOR"" -> S, A, V, O, R. 
- S in 1: new
- A in 2: good
- V in 3: new
- O in 4: good
- R in 5: good

This tests S and V.

S is a very common letter, so testing S is good.

Similarly, ""PAPER"" has E and P, but E forbidden.

""WAVER"" has E.

So ""SAVOR"" is a good candidate.

But let's compare to ""PAROL"" and ""VALOR"".

We have several options:

1. PAROL: tests P and L, with R in 3 and O in 4.
2. VALOR: tests V and L, with O in 4 and R in 5.
3. SAVOR: tests S and V, with O in 4 and R in 5.

Since S is more common than V or P, ""SAVOR"" might be better.

But note: we also have the possibility that O is in position 1 or 3.

In ""SAVOR"", we are assuming O is in 4 and R in 5, but if O is actually in 1, we won't know.

We need to consider that O could be in position 1.

For example, if the word is ""OASIS"", but I is forbidden, so not.

What words have O in position 1, A in 2, and R and O? But O is only once? Or duplicate?

We don't know if there are duplicate letters, but so far no feedback suggests duplicates.

So assume no duplicates.

So if O is in position 1, then the word is O A ? ? ?

And R must be in 3,4, or 5.

And the other two positions with new letters.

For example, ""OAKER"" not valid.

""OARED"" has E.

""OASIS"" has I.

""OAVES"" has E.

""OARIC"" has C.

Not many common words with O in 1, A in 2, and R, without forbidden letters.

""BOARD"" has B, O, A, R, D -> O in 1? Actually, ""BOARD"" is B in 1, O in 2? But we need A in 2, so O in 1 and A in 2: ""O A ? ? ?""

""OARED"" is the only one I can think of, but E is forbidden.

""OAKUM"" no R.

So perhaps O in position 1 is less likely because of few words.

Similarly, O in position 3: then word is ? A O ? ?

And R must be in 4 or 5 (since not 1,2, and 3 is taken by O).

For example, ""HAROS"" not a word.

""FAROS"" has F, A, R, O, S -> but if O in 3: F A O R S? That would be F in 1, A in 2, O in 3, R in 4, S in 5.

But we have R in position 4, which is possible, and O in 3, which is possible.

""FAROS"" is a word? Faro is a game, but FAROS might be plural? Not sure.

""TAROS"" has T, forbidden.

""BARON"" has N.

""CAROM"" has C.

""MAJOR"" has J, but O in 3? M A J O R -> O in 4, not 3.

If O in position 3: ? A O ? ?

With R in 4 or 5.

""GAOLS"" G A O L S -> O in 3, but no R.

""PAOLO"" has duplicate O? P A O L O, but duplicate O and no R.

Not many options.

Therefore, it's more likely that O is in position 4 and R in position 3 or 5, or O in position 1 is rare.

So in our guess, we can assume O is not in 1 for now, and test O in 4 and R in 3 or 5.

Back to ""SAVOR"": S A V O R

This has:
- S in 1: tests S
- A in 2: correct
- V in 3: tests V
- O in 4: tests O in position 4
- R in 5: tests R in position 5

If we get feedback that O is not in 4 or R not in 5, we know they must be in other positions.

Similarly, ""VALOR"" has V in 1, A in 2, L in 3, O in 4, R in 5.

But ""SAVOR"" tests S instead of L, and S is more common.

Another word: ""SABOR"" is not English, I think.

""SAVOR"" is a word meaning to enjoy.

We also have ""SHARO"" but not standard.

So I think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice.

But let's see if we can test a word that covers more possibilities.

For example, if we put O in position 1: but we don't have a good word.

What about ""OAKUM"" no R.

So perhaps skip that.

Another idea: ""ROWDY"" but no A in 2.

We must have A in 2.

So I think ""SAVOR"" is fine.

But we have another option: ""DOZAR"" not a word.

""SOAPY"" no R and A in 3.

I think we should go with ""SAVOR"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has O in 4 and R in 5, then ""SAVOR"" would get A correct, and O and R correct if in those positions, or wrong position if not.

But we don't know.

We could choose a word that has R in position 3 and O in position 4, like ""PAROL"".

""PAROL"" has P and L.

But S is more common than P and L? S is very common.

In terms of frequency, S is more common than V, P, L.

But we are testing two letters: in ""SAVOR"" we test S and V.

In ""PAROL"" we test P and L.

S is the most common consonant, so testing S is good.

Moreover, if S is in the word, we get information.

Similarly, V is less common, but we have to test it.

Another word: ""SALVO"" -> S, A, L, V, O. 
- A in 2: good.
- O in 5? But O cannot be in position 5. So invalid.

""SAVOY"" -> S, A, V, O, Y. 
- O in 4? S A V O Y -> O in 4, Y in 5. 
- But no R? We must include R. So invalid.

Therefore, ""SAVOR"" seems the best.

But ""SAVOR"" has R in position 5, which we are testing.

We could test R in position 3.

For example, ""SAROD"" -> S, A, R, O, D. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: testing R in 3.
- O in 4: testing O in 4.
- D in 5: new.

This tests S, R in 3, O in 4, and D.

But ""SAROD"" is a musical instrument, might be acceptable.

But ""SAVOR"" is more common.

I think either is fine.

But let's choose ""SAVOR"" for the third guess.

So the word is S A V O R.

But let me write it: positions 1:S, 2:A, 3:V, 4:O, 5:R.

We are testing:
- S in 1
- V in 3
- O in 4 (if O is in 4, we get ✓, else if O is elsewhere, we get - or x? But O is in the word, so if not in 4, we get - for O)
- R in 5 (similarly)

This should give us good information.

So I'll go with ""SAVOR"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(absent), R(present but wrong position), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(absent).  
  - This means:  
    - R and A are in the secret word, but R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.  
    - C, N, and E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: RATIO** → Feedback: R(present but wrong position), A(correct position), T(absent), I(absent), O(present but wrong position).  
  - This means:  
    - A is confirmed in position 2.  
    - R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was marked as wrong position in the second guess, and we already knew it wasn't in position 2 from the first guess).  
    - O is in the word but not in position 5.  
    - T and I are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ _ _` (A is fixed in position 2).  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A (position 2), R, and O.  
- **R constraints**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5).  
- **O constraints**: Cannot be in position 5 (must be in 1, 3, or 4).  
- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I (cannot appear in any position).  
- **Goal for next guess**:  
  - Must include R and O (since they are confirmed present).  
  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, V) to gather more information.  
  - Avoid absent letters (C, N, E, T, I).  
  - Prioritize words that test R and O in possible positions (e.g., R in 3/4/5, O in 1/3/4).  

### Why ""SAVOR""?
- **Structure**: S (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), V (position 3), O (position 4), R (position 5).  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Tests R in position 5 (a possible position) and O in position 4 (a possible position).  
  - Introduces two new common consonants: S (very high frequency) and V (less common but useful for elimination).  
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, N, E, T, I).  
  - If R or O are not in the guessed positions, the feedback will help narrow down their locations (e.g., if O is not in position 4, it must be in 1 or 3).  
- **Alternative considered**: ""VALOR"" was also evaluated, but ""SAVOR"" is preferred because S is a more common letter than V, increasing the chance of gaining useful information.  

This guess maximizes information by testing key constraints and exploring new letters efficiently.

<guess>SAVOR</guess>",SAVOR,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: RATIO
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 1)  [since we guessed R in position 1 and got '-']
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- T: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

So, from this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter A in position 2 (because A in ""RATIO"" was correct).
2. The letter R is in the word, but not in position 1 or 2 (since we tried position 1 in the second guess and it was wrong, and position 2 in the first guess was also wrong).
3. The letter O is in the word, but not in position 5.
4. The letters C, N, E, T, I are not in the word.

Also, from the first guess, we know R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3, but now we know A is fixed in position 2.

So, to summarize:

- Position 2 is A.

Letters in the word: A (in pos 2), R (somewhere, but not pos 1 or 2), O (somewhere, not pos 5).

Letters not in the word: C, N, E, T, I.

We have 5 positions: _ A _ _ _

R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5 (since not 1 or 2).

O must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4 (since not 5).

We need to make a third guess. We should try to find a word that:

- Has A in position 2 (fixed).
- Includes R and O (since they are in the word, and we need to find their positions).
- Avoids C, N, E, T, I.
- Tests new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R: 3,4,5
Possible positions for O: 1,3,4

But note: if we put O in position 3 or 4, and R in position 3 or 4, they might conflict? But they are different letters, so they can be in the same word.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried. The letters we haven't tried and are common: S, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using letters we know are not in the word.

Let's list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, N, E, T, I, and also we know A, R, O are in the word, so we must include them.

The word must have A in position 2, and also R and O.

So the word pattern: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With:
- letter1: can be any except C, N, E, T, I, and must be a letter we haven't ruled out. Also, O could be here.
- letter3: can be R or O or a new letter, but note R and O must be placed somewhere. Also, we know A is not in position 3 (from first guess, but now we have A in 2, so position 3 is open). But we must place R and O in the remaining positions: 1,3,4,5, but with constraints: R not in 1, O not in 5, and R must be in 3,4,5 and O in 1,3,4.

So the positions for R and O must be assigned to three positions: 1,3,4,5, but with:
- R: 3,4,5
- O: 1,3,4

So position 1 can only be O (if O is there) or a new letter? But O can be in 1, so if O is in 1, then R must be in 3,4, or 5. If O is in 3, then R can be in 4 or 5 (since 3 is taken). Similarly, if O is in 4, R can be in 3 or 5.

We also have to fill the remaining positions with new letters that are not forbidden.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to test R and O in positions that are possible and also test new common letters.

Let's think of words that fit: [O?] A [R? or O?] [R? or O?] [R?]

For example:
- If we put O in position 1: then word starts with O, then A in 2, then we need to place R in 3,4, or 5, and the other two positions with new letters.

But we don't know if O is in position 1.

Similarly, we could put R in position 3, etc.

We should consider common words.

List of possible words with A in position 2 and containing R and O, without C, N, E, T, I.

Common letters to try: S, L, D, M, P, U, etc.

For example:
- ""OASIS"" -> but has S and I? I is forbidden. Also, duplicate S? And we don't know about S. But I is not allowed.

I is forbidden, so we cannot use I.

Similarly, ""OAKUM"" -> but K and U? And no R? We need R.

We must have R.

""ROARS"" -> but R in position 1? We know R cannot be in position 1 (from second guess feedback: R in position 1 was wrong). Also, A in position 3? But we have A fixed in position 2, so not.

We have A in position 2, so the word must be ? A ? ? ?

""PAROL"" -> P, A, R, O, L. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: possible (since R can be in 3,4,5)
- O in 4: possible (O can be in 1,3,4, but here in 4)
- L in 5: new letter.
- But we have P in 1: new letter.

This word: P A R O L

Check the letters: P, A, R, O, L. We know A, R, O are in the word. P and L are new.

Also, avoids C, N, E, T, I.

This seems good.

Another word: ""CAROL"" -> but C is forbidden. Invalid.

""MARSH"" -> M, A, R, S, H. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: good.
- But no O? We must include O. So invalid.

We must include O.

""FARGO"" -> F, A, R, G, O. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: good.
- O in 5: but O cannot be in position 5? From feedback, O is not in position 5 (from second guess, O in position 5 was wrong). So O cannot be in 5. Therefore, ""FARGO"" has O in 5 -> invalid.

""DOGMA"" -> D, O, G, M, A. But A is in position 5, not 2. We need A in position 2. Invalid.

""LOAMY"" -> L, O, A, M, Y. A in position 3? Not 2. Invalid.

Back to ""PAROL"": P A R O L.

Positions:
- P in 1: new
- A in 2: correct (we know)
- R in 3: we are testing R in position 3 (which is possible)
- O in 4: testing O in position 4 (possible, since O not in 5)
- L in 5: new

This tests P and L, and also checks if R is in 3 and O in 4.

But what if R is not in 3? We might get feedback that R is elsewhere.

Another possibility: ""OARED"" -> but E is forbidden. Invalid.

""SOAPY"" -> S, O, A, P, Y. 
- O in 1: possible (O can be in 1)
- A in 3? But we need A in 2. Here A is in 3 -> invalid.

""BOARS"" -> B, O, A, R, S. 
- O in 1: possible
- A in 3? Not 2. Invalid.

""ROAMS"" -> R, O, A, M, S. 
- R in 1: but R cannot be in position 1 (we tried and it was wrong). So invalid.

""OAKER"" -> not common, and R in 5? But O in 1, A in 2? Then K, E, R? E forbidden.

""PARKA"" -> P, A, R, K, A. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: good.
- But duplicate A? And no O? We need O. Invalid.

""GATOR"" -> G, A, T, O, R. 
- A in 2: good.
- T: but T is forbidden (from second guess, T is not in the word). So invalid.

""MAJOR"" -> M, A, J, O, R. 
- A in 2: good.
- J: not very common, but possible.
- O in 4: good.
- R in 5: good (R can be in 5).

This word: M A J O R

Positions:
- M in 1: new
- A in 2: correct
- J in 3: new
- O in 4: testing O in 4
- R in 5: testing R in 5

But J is not a common letter, so it might not be efficient for information.

Similarly, ""VALOR"" -> V, A, L, O, R. 
- A in 2: good.
- V in 1: new
- L in 3: new
- O in 4: good
- R in 5: good

This tests V and L.

""VALOR"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""PALOR"" is not a word.

""RADON"" -> N forbidden.

So ""VALOR"" seems good: V, A, L, O, R.

But we have O in position 4 and R in position 5.

We know O cannot be in position 5, but position 4 is allowed. R in position 5 is allowed (since we haven't tried position 5 for R).

Another word: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R. But N is forbidden. Invalid.

""LABOR"" -> L, A, B, O, R. 
- A in 2: good.
- B in 3: new
- O in 4: good
- R in 5: good

This tests L and B.

But B is less common than some other letters.

""SAVOR"" -> S, A, V, O, R. 
- S in 1: new
- A in 2: good
- V in 3: new
- O in 4: good
- R in 5: good

This tests S and V.

S is a very common letter, so testing S is good.

Similarly, ""PAPER"" has E and P, but E forbidden.

""WAVER"" has E.

So ""SAVOR"" is a good candidate.

But let's compare to ""PAROL"" and ""VALOR"".

We have several options:

1. PAROL: tests P and L, with R in 3 and O in 4.
2. VALOR: tests V and L, with O in 4 and R in 5.
3. SAVOR: tests S and V, with O in 4 and R in 5.

Since S is more common than V or P, ""SAVOR"" might be better.

But note: we also have the possibility that O is in position 1 or 3.

In ""SAVOR"", we are assuming O is in 4 and R in 5, but if O is actually in 1, we won't know.

We need to consider that O could be in position 1.

For example, if the word is ""OASIS"", but I is forbidden, so not.

What words have O in position 1, A in 2, and R and O? But O is only once? Or duplicate?

We don't know if there are duplicate letters, but so far no feedback suggests duplicates.

So assume no duplicates.

So if O is in position 1, then the word is O A ? ? ?

And R must be in 3,4, or 5.

And the other two positions with new letters.

For example, ""OAKER"" not valid.

""OARED"" has E.

""OASIS"" has I.

""OAVES"" has E.

""OARIC"" has C.

Not many common words with O in 1, A in 2, and R, without forbidden letters.

""BOARD"" has B, O, A, R, D -> O in 1? Actually, ""BOARD"" is B in 1, O in 2? But we need A in 2, so O in 1 and A in 2: ""O A ? ? ?""

""OARED"" is the only one I can think of, but E is forbidden.

""OAKUM"" no R.

So perhaps O in position 1 is less likely because of few words.

Similarly, O in position 3: then word is ? A O ? ?

And R must be in 4 or 5 (since not 1,2, and 3 is taken by O).

For example, ""HAROS"" not a word.

""FAROS"" has F, A, R, O, S -> but if O in 3: F A O R S? That would be F in 1, A in 2, O in 3, R in 4, S in 5.

But we have R in position 4, which is possible, and O in 3, which is possible.

""FAROS"" is a word? Faro is a game, but FAROS might be plural? Not sure.

""TAROS"" has T, forbidden.

""BARON"" has N.

""CAROM"" has C.

""MAJOR"" has J, but O in 3? M A J O R -> O in 4, not 3.

If O in position 3: ? A O ? ?

With R in 4 or 5.

""GAOLS"" G A O L S -> O in 3, but no R.

""PAOLO"" has duplicate O? P A O L O, but duplicate O and no R.

Not many options.

Therefore, it's more likely that O is in position 4 and R in position 3 or 5, or O in position 1 is rare.

So in our guess, we can assume O is not in 1 for now, and test O in 4 and R in 3 or 5.

Back to ""SAVOR"": S A V O R

This has:
- S in 1: tests S
- A in 2: correct
- V in 3: tests V
- O in 4: tests O in position 4
- R in 5: tests R in position 5

If we get feedback that O is not in 4 or R not in 5, we know they must be in other positions.

Similarly, ""VALOR"" has V in 1, A in 2, L in 3, O in 4, R in 5.

But ""SAVOR"" tests S instead of L, and S is more common.

Another word: ""SABOR"" is not English, I think.

""SAVOR"" is a word meaning to enjoy.

We also have ""SHARO"" but not standard.

So I think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice.

But let's see if we can test a word that covers more possibilities.

For example, if we put O in position 1: but we don't have a good word.

What about ""OAKUM"" no R.

So perhaps skip that.

Another idea: ""ROWDY"" but no A in 2.

We must have A in 2.

So I think ""SAVOR"" is fine.

But we have another option: ""DOZAR"" not a word.

""SOAPY"" no R and A in 3.

I think we should go with ""SAVOR"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has O in 4 and R in 5, then ""SAVOR"" would get A correct, and O and R correct if in those positions, or wrong position if not.

But we don't know.

We could choose a word that has R in position 3 and O in position 4, like ""PAROL"".

""PAROL"" has P and L.

But S is more common than P and L? S is very common.

In terms of frequency, S is more common than V, P, L.

But we are testing two letters: in ""SAVOR"" we test S and V.

In ""PAROL"" we test P and L.

S is the most common consonant, so testing S is good.

Moreover, if S is in the word, we get information.

Similarly, V is less common, but we have to test it.

Another word: ""SALVO"" -> S, A, L, V, O. 
- A in 2: good.
- O in 5? But O cannot be in position 5. So invalid.

""SAVOY"" -> S, A, V, O, Y. 
- O in 4? S A V O Y -> O in 4, Y in 5. 
- But no R? We must include R. So invalid.

Therefore, ""SAVOR"" seems the best.

But ""SAVOR"" has R in position 5, which we are testing.

We could test R in position 3.

For example, ""SAROD"" -> S, A, R, O, D. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: testing R in 3.
- O in 4: testing O in 4.
- D in 5: new.

This tests S, R in 3, O in 4, and D.

But ""SAROD"" is a musical instrument, might be acceptable.

But ""SAVOR"" is more common.

I think either is fine.

But let's choose ""SAVOR"" for the third guess.

So the word is S A V O R.

But let me write it: positions 1:S, 2:A, 3:V, 4:O, 5:R.

We are testing:
- S in 1
- V in 3
- O in 4 (if O is in 4, we get ✓, else if O is elsewhere, we get - or x? But O is in the word, so if not in 4, we get - for O)
- R in 5 (similarly)

This should give us good information.

So I'll go with ""SAVOR"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(absent), R(present but wrong position), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(absent).  
  - This means:  
    - R and A are in the secret word, but R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.  
    - C, N, and E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: RATIO** → Feedback: R(present but wrong position), A(correct position), T(absent), I(absent), O(present but wrong position).  
  - This means:  
    - A is confirmed in position 2.  
    - R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was marked as wrong position in the second guess, and we already knew it wasn't in position 2 from the first guess).  
    - O is in the word but not in position 5.  
    - T and I are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ _ _` (A is fixed in position 2).  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A (position 2), R, and O.  
- **R constraints**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5).  
- **O constraints**: Cannot be in position 5 (must be in 1, 3, or 4).  
- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I (cannot appear in any position).  
- **Goal for next guess**:  
  - Must include R and O (since they are confirmed present).  
  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, V) to gather more information.  
  - Avoid absent letters (C, N, E, T, I).  
  - Prioritize words that test R and O in possible positions (e.g., R in 3/4/5, O in 1/3/4).  

### Why ""SAVOR""?
- **Structure**: S (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), V (position 3), O (position 4), R (position 5).  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Tests R in position 5 (a possible position) and O in position 4 (a possible position).  
  - Introduces two new common consonants: S (very high frequency) and V (less common but useful for elimination).  
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, N, E, T, I).  
  - If R or O are not in the guessed positions, the feedback will help narrow down their locations (e.g., if O is not in position 4, it must be in 1 or 3).  
- **Alternative considered**: ""VALOR"" was also evaluated, but ""SAVOR"" is preferred because S is a more common letter than V, increasing the chance of gaining useful information.  

This guess maximizes information by testing key constraints and exploring new letters efficiently.",Guess 3: SAVOR -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) V(✓) O(✓) R(✓),FAIL

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are at the beginning of the game. There are no prior guesses to work from.
 Since it's the first guess, we want a word that can provide a lot of information. 
 The idea is to use a word that has common letters and a balanced set of vowels and consonants.

 A popular starting word in such games is ""CRANE"" because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.
 Another good one is ""SLATE"". Let me think about which one to choose.

 However, note that we are not limited to any particular strategy. But for maximum information, 
 we want to cover vowels and common consonants.

 Let me list out the vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We have 5 letters so we want at least 2 vowels.

 The word ""CRANE"" has: C, R, A, N, E -> vowels: A, E; consonants: C, R, N. 
 Similarly, ""SLATE"" has: S, L, A, T, E -> vowels: A, E; consonants: S, L, T.

 Both are good. I'll go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

 Another candidate is ""ROATE"", but let's stick with a common word.

 So my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

 But note: We are trying to get as much information as possible. Let me also consider ""RAISE"". 
 ""RAISE"": R, A, I, S, E -> vowels: A, I, E; consonants: R, S. That has three vowels.

 However, I recall that ""CRANE"" is a standard first guess.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"".<thinking>
For the first guess, I should choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This typically involves using common letters (both vowels and consonants) to cover a broad range. A good starting word should include:
- Multiple vowels (like A, E, I) to test common vowel placements
- Common consonants (like R, S, T, N, C)
Avoiding repeated letters is also beneficial to test more letters.

A popular and effective starting word in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it:
1. Contains three vowels (A and E) – though E is the only true vowel, A and E cover two of the most frequent vowels.
2. Includes common consonants (C, R, N).
3. Has no repeating letters.
4. Covers less common letters like C and N early, which can help eliminate possibilities.

Alternatives like ""SLATE"" or ""RAISE"" are also strong, but ""CRANE"" is mathematically strong based on word frequency analysis. Since this is the first guess, I'll start with ""CRANE"".
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.
- The letter R is in the word but not in the second position (since we guessed it in position 2 and got a '-' meaning it's present but not there).
- The letter A is in the word but not in the third position.

We also know the secret word must contain R and A, and does not contain C, N, E.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, N, E (since they are not in the word).
- Must contain R and A (because they are present).
- The R cannot be in position 2 (because we already tried that and it was wrong position).
- The A cannot be in position 3.

Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think about possible positions for R and A.

Since R is not in position 2, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, A is not in position 3, so it could be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

But note: we don't know if there are duplicate letters, but for now we assume no duplicates (unless feedback suggests otherwise).

We also want to avoid the letters we know are not in the word: C, N, E.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, M, P, etc.

A good strategy is to try to place R and A in new positions and test other common letters.

Let's try to form a word that includes R and A, and three new letters.

We also want to avoid the positions we know are wrong for R and A.

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4, 5
Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5

But note: we cannot have both R and A in the same position? No, because they are different.

We should try to put R in a position we haven't tested and similarly for A.

We tested R in position 2 and it was wrong, so we can try R in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Similarly, A was tested in position 3 and wrong, so we can try A in 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to test other letters. Let's try to cover more vowels and common consonants.

We haven't tested: S, T, L, I, O, etc.

A good candidate might be a word that has R and A, and also S, T, or L.

Let me think of words that contain R and A, and avoid C, N, E.

For example:
- ""PARTY"" -> but has T and Y, but we don't know about T and Y. However, we are limited to 5 letters.

But note: we must use only English words.

Another idea: ""STARK"" -> S, T, A, R, K. But we have to place R and A in new positions.

In ""STARK"":
- A is in position 3? But we know A cannot be in position 3. So that's bad.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

So, let's list words with R and A, without C, N, E, and A not in position 3, R not in position 2.

Possible words:
- ""RADIO"": R in position 1, A in position 2. But we don't know about D, I, O. Also, we test I and O which are vowels. However, we have to avoid E, but I and O are new.
  - But note: we have R in position 1 (which we haven't tested) and A in position 2 (which we haven't tested for A). This seems good.

But wait, we also want to test more common consonants. ""RADIO"" has two vowels (A and I, O) and only one consonant (R, D). Maybe not the best for information.

- ""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S. 
  - A in position 2? That's allowed (since we only know A is not in 3). 
  - R in position 3? That's allowed (since we only know R is not in 2). 
  - Also, we test P, T, S which are common.

But let's check the positions: 
- P in 1, A in 2, R in 3, T in 4, S in 5.

We haven't tested position 1, 4, 5 at all. And we know A is not in 3, so position 2 is new for A. R is not in 2, so position 3 is new for R.

This seems good.

Another candidate: ""TRAIL"" -> T, R, A, I, L.
- T in 1, R in 2 -> but R in position 2 is not allowed because we already tried R in position 2 and it was present but wrong position? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again because it would be a waste. We must put R in a new position.

In ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 again. That would be a mistake because we already know it's not there. So we avoid that.

Similarly, we cannot put A in position 3.

So ""TRAIL"" is invalid because R is in position 2.

Another word: ""ROAST"" -> R in 1, O in 2, A in 3? But A cannot be in position 3. So invalid.

""BRAVO"" -> B, R, A, V, O. 
- R in position 2? Again, we cannot put R in position 2. So invalid.

""FARTS"" -> F, A, R, T, S. 
- A in position 2? Allowed. 
- R in position 3? Allowed. 
- F, T, S are new.

But F is less common. Maybe not ideal.

""DARTS"" -> D, A, R, T, S. 
- A in 2, R in 3. 
- D, T, S are new.

Similarly, ""HARTS"" (if valid) but ""HARTS"" is not common. ""DARTS"" is common.

But we also have ""PARTS"" as I thought earlier.

Another one: ""WARTS"" -> W, A, R, T, S. 
- A in 2, R in 3.

W is less common.

So ""PARTS"" seems good: common letters P, A, R, T, S.

But note: we are not sure if P, T, S are in the word, but we are testing them.

We could also consider ""RASPY"": R in 1, A in 2, S in 3, P in 4, Y in 5. 
- A in 2 is allowed, R in 1 is allowed (we haven't tried position 1 for R). 
- But we are testing Y which is less common.

Another idea: ""SAFER"" -> S, A, F, E, R. But E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So invalid.

We must avoid E.

Similarly, ""CARET"" has C and E -> invalid.

So back to ""PARTS"": it has no forbidden letters and tests P, T, S.

But let me confirm: P, A, R, T, S.

Positions:
- P in 1: new
- A in 2: new for A (we only know A is not in 3, so 2 is untested)
- R in 3: new for R (we only know R is not in 2, so 3 is untested)
- T in 4: new
- S in 5: new

This will give us information about these positions and letters.

Another candidate: ""RANTS"" -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So invalid.

""MAILS"" -> but no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. And also A. So the word must have R and A.

So ""MAILS"" doesn't have R -> invalid.

We must include both R and A.

Another word: ""TARES"" -> but E is forbidden. Invalid.

""BARKS"" -> B, A, R, K, S. 
- A in 2? Allowed. 
- R in 3? Allowed. 
- B, K, S are new.

But K is less common than T or S? Maybe.

""PARKS"" -> similar.

But I think ""PARTS"" is better because T is more common than K.

We could also try to test a vowel. We haven't tested I, O, U.

For example, ""RAPID"": R in 1, A in 2, P in 3, I in 4, D in 5. 
- This tests I and D. 
- But we are not testing S or T.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to test as many common letters as possible.

The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E and N are out, so next are T, A (we have A), O, I, S, H, R (we have R), D, L, U.

So we should test T, O, I, S, etc.

In ""PARTS"", we test P, A (already known), R (known), T, S. So we are testing P, T, S.

P is not as common as T or S. T and S are very common.

Another word: ""STARS"" -> S, T, A, R, S. But it has duplicate S? And A is in position 3? Not allowed for A.

""ARTSY"" -> A in 1, R in 2? But R cannot be in position 2. So invalid.

""RATIO"": R in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, O in 5. 
- This tests T, I, O. 
- Positions: A in 2 (new), R in 1 (new), T in 3, I in 4, O in 5.

This tests three new vowels (I, O) and T (common consonant). And we avoid the forbidden positions.

This might be even better because we get information about vowels.

We know the word has A and R, but we don't know about vowels. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but likely.

In ""RATIO"", we have A, I, O as vowels and R, T as consonants.

This covers more vowels.

Alternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar but with D instead of T. T is more common than D.

So ""RATIO"" seems good.

But let me check: we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2. We haven't tested these positions for R and A.

We know R is in the word but not in position 2, so position 1 is a possibility. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so position 2 is a possibility.

So ""RATIO"" is a valid guess.

Another option: ""ORBIT"" -> but O in 1, R in 2? R in position 2 is not allowed. So invalid.

""TRIAD"": T, R, I, A, D. 
- R in position 2? Again, not allowed. Invalid.

So between ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"", which one?

""PARTS"" tests consonants: P, T, S (and known A, R)
""RATIO"" tests vowels: I, O and consonant T (and known A, R)

Since we have only tested one word and we don't know about vowels (we only know A is present, but there might be other vowels), testing two vowels (I and O) might be beneficial.

Also, T is a very common consonant.

Moreover, ""RATIO"" is a common word.

So I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice.

But note: we are not testing S, which is very common. But we can test S in the next guess if needed.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that includes S.

For example, ""RAINS"" -> but N is forbidden. Invalid.

""ROAST"" -> A in position 3? Not allowed.

""RASIS"" -> not a word.

""RASPS"" -> duplicate S and A in 2? But A in 2 is allowed, but duplicate S might not be ideal.

""RASPS"": R in 1, A in 2, S in 3, P in 4, S in 5. Duplicate S, which might not be efficient.

""TRAYS"" -> T, R, A, Y, S. But R in position 2? Not allowed.

""SATYR"" -> S, A, T, Y, R. 
- A in position 2? Allowed. 
- R in position 5? Allowed. 
- But Y is less common and the word is uncommon.

Not ideal.

""STAIR"" -> S, T, A, I, R. 
- A in position 3? Not allowed. Invalid.

""TAROT"" -> T, A, R, O, T. 
- A in position 2? Allowed. 
- R in position 3? Allowed. 
- But duplicate T? And O is a vowel.

But duplicate T might not be good.

So ""RATIO"" seems a solid choice.

Another one: ""AUDIO"" -> but no R? We must include R. So invalid.

Therefore, I will go with ""RATIO"".

So the second guess is ""RATIO"".<thinking>
We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": 
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions guessed (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
2. The letters C, N, and E are absent from the secret word.
3. For the next guess:
   - Must include R and A (since they are confirmed present).
   - Avoid C, N, E.
   - R cannot be in position 2 (already tested and wrong).
   - A cannot be in position 3 (already tested and wrong).
   - Should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, O, S) to gather more information.

Strategy for the second guess:
- Choose a word with R and A in new positions (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).
- Include other high-frequency letters not yet tested (like T, I, O) to maximize information gain.
- Avoid letters known to be absent (C, N, E).

After evaluating options:
- ""RATIO"" is a strong candidate because:
  - Contains R (position 1) and A (position 2), both in new untested positions.
  - Tests new common letters: T (position 3), I (position 4), O (position 5).
  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E).
  - Provides broad coverage of vowels (A, I, O) and consonants (R, T).

This guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing three new letters.

<guess>RATIO</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

Guess 2: RATIO
- R: - (in the word, but not in position 1)  [since we guessed R in position 1 and got '-']
- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)
- T: x (not in the word)
- I: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word, but not in position 5)

So, from this, we know:

1. The secret word has the letter A in position 2 (because A in ""RATIO"" was correct).
2. The letter R is in the word, but not in position 1 or 2 (since we tried position 1 in the second guess and it was wrong, and position 2 in the first guess was also wrong).
3. The letter O is in the word, but not in position 5.
4. The letters C, N, E, T, I are not in the word.

Also, from the first guess, we know R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3, but now we know A is fixed in position 2.

So, to summarize:

- Position 2 is A.

Letters in the word: A (in pos 2), R (somewhere, but not pos 1 or 2), O (somewhere, not pos 5).

Letters not in the word: C, N, E, T, I.

We have 5 positions: _ A _ _ _

R must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5 (since not 1 or 2).

O must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4 (since not 5).

We need to make a third guess. We should try to find a word that:

- Has A in position 2 (fixed).
- Includes R and O (since they are in the word, and we need to find their positions).
- Avoids C, N, E, T, I.
- Tests new common letters to get more information.

Possible positions for R: 3,4,5
Possible positions for O: 1,3,4

But note: if we put O in position 3 or 4, and R in position 3 or 4, they might conflict? But they are different letters, so they can be in the same word.

We also want to test other common letters that we haven't tried. The letters we haven't tried and are common: S, L, U, D, M, P, etc.

We should avoid using letters we know are not in the word.

Let's list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, N, E, T, I, and also we know A, R, O are in the word, so we must include them.

The word must have A in position 2, and also R and O.

So the word pattern: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]

With:
- letter1: can be any except C, N, E, T, I, and must be a letter we haven't ruled out. Also, O could be here.
- letter3: can be R or O or a new letter, but note R and O must be placed somewhere. Also, we know A is not in position 3 (from first guess, but now we have A in 2, so position 3 is open). But we must place R and O in the remaining positions: 1,3,4,5, but with constraints: R not in 1, O not in 5, and R must be in 3,4,5 and O in 1,3,4.

So the positions for R and O must be assigned to three positions: 1,3,4,5, but with:
- R: 3,4,5
- O: 1,3,4

So position 1 can only be O (if O is there) or a new letter? But O can be in 1, so if O is in 1, then R must be in 3,4, or 5. If O is in 3, then R can be in 4 or 5 (since 3 is taken). Similarly, if O is in 4, R can be in 3 or 5.

We also have to fill the remaining positions with new letters that are not forbidden.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to test R and O in positions that are possible and also test new common letters.

Let's think of words that fit: [O?] A [R? or O?] [R? or O?] [R?]

For example:
- If we put O in position 1: then word starts with O, then A in 2, then we need to place R in 3,4, or 5, and the other two positions with new letters.

But we don't know if O is in position 1.

Similarly, we could put R in position 3, etc.

We should consider common words.

List of possible words with A in position 2 and containing R and O, without C, N, E, T, I.

Common letters to try: S, L, D, M, P, U, etc.

For example:
- ""OASIS"" -> but has S and I? I is forbidden. Also, duplicate S? And we don't know about S. But I is not allowed.

I is forbidden, so we cannot use I.

Similarly, ""OAKUM"" -> but K and U? And no R? We need R.

We must have R.

""ROARS"" -> but R in position 1? We know R cannot be in position 1 (from second guess feedback: R in position 1 was wrong). Also, A in position 3? But we have A fixed in position 2, so not.

We have A in position 2, so the word must be ? A ? ? ?

""PAROL"" -> P, A, R, O, L. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: possible (since R can be in 3,4,5)
- O in 4: possible (O can be in 1,3,4, but here in 4)
- L in 5: new letter.
- But we have P in 1: new letter.

This word: P A R O L

Check the letters: P, A, R, O, L. We know A, R, O are in the word. P and L are new.

Also, avoids C, N, E, T, I.

This seems good.

Another word: ""CAROL"" -> but C is forbidden. Invalid.

""MARSH"" -> M, A, R, S, H. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: good.
- But no O? We must include O. So invalid.

We must include O.

""FARGO"" -> F, A, R, G, O. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: good.
- O in 5: but O cannot be in position 5? From feedback, O is not in position 5 (from second guess, O in position 5 was wrong). So O cannot be in 5. Therefore, ""FARGO"" has O in 5 -> invalid.

""DOGMA"" -> D, O, G, M, A. But A is in position 5, not 2. We need A in position 2. Invalid.

""LOAMY"" -> L, O, A, M, Y. A in position 3? Not 2. Invalid.

Back to ""PAROL"": P A R O L.

Positions:
- P in 1: new
- A in 2: correct (we know)
- R in 3: we are testing R in position 3 (which is possible)
- O in 4: testing O in position 4 (possible, since O not in 5)
- L in 5: new

This tests P and L, and also checks if R is in 3 and O in 4.

But what if R is not in 3? We might get feedback that R is elsewhere.

Another possibility: ""OARED"" -> but E is forbidden. Invalid.

""SOAPY"" -> S, O, A, P, Y. 
- O in 1: possible (O can be in 1)
- A in 3? But we need A in 2. Here A is in 3 -> invalid.

""BOARS"" -> B, O, A, R, S. 
- O in 1: possible
- A in 3? Not 2. Invalid.

""ROAMS"" -> R, O, A, M, S. 
- R in 1: but R cannot be in position 1 (we tried and it was wrong). So invalid.

""OAKER"" -> not common, and R in 5? But O in 1, A in 2? Then K, E, R? E forbidden.

""PARKA"" -> P, A, R, K, A. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: good.
- But duplicate A? And no O? We need O. Invalid.

""GATOR"" -> G, A, T, O, R. 
- A in 2: good.
- T: but T is forbidden (from second guess, T is not in the word). So invalid.

""MAJOR"" -> M, A, J, O, R. 
- A in 2: good.
- J: not very common, but possible.
- O in 4: good.
- R in 5: good (R can be in 5).

This word: M A J O R

Positions:
- M in 1: new
- A in 2: correct
- J in 3: new
- O in 4: testing O in 4
- R in 5: testing R in 5

But J is not a common letter, so it might not be efficient for information.

Similarly, ""VALOR"" -> V, A, L, O, R. 
- A in 2: good.
- V in 1: new
- L in 3: new
- O in 4: good
- R in 5: good

This tests V and L.

""VALOR"" is a common word.

Similarly, ""PALOR"" is not a word.

""RADON"" -> N forbidden.

So ""VALOR"" seems good: V, A, L, O, R.

But we have O in position 4 and R in position 5.

We know O cannot be in position 5, but position 4 is allowed. R in position 5 is allowed (since we haven't tried position 5 for R).

Another word: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R. But N is forbidden. Invalid.

""LABOR"" -> L, A, B, O, R. 
- A in 2: good.
- B in 3: new
- O in 4: good
- R in 5: good

This tests L and B.

But B is less common than some other letters.

""SAVOR"" -> S, A, V, O, R. 
- S in 1: new
- A in 2: good
- V in 3: new
- O in 4: good
- R in 5: good

This tests S and V.

S is a very common letter, so testing S is good.

Similarly, ""PAPER"" has E and P, but E forbidden.

""WAVER"" has E.

So ""SAVOR"" is a good candidate.

But let's compare to ""PAROL"" and ""VALOR"".

We have several options:

1. PAROL: tests P and L, with R in 3 and O in 4.
2. VALOR: tests V and L, with O in 4 and R in 5.
3. SAVOR: tests S and V, with O in 4 and R in 5.

Since S is more common than V or P, ""SAVOR"" might be better.

But note: we also have the possibility that O is in position 1 or 3.

In ""SAVOR"", we are assuming O is in 4 and R in 5, but if O is actually in 1, we won't know.

We need to consider that O could be in position 1.

For example, if the word is ""OASIS"", but I is forbidden, so not.

What words have O in position 1, A in 2, and R and O? But O is only once? Or duplicate?

We don't know if there are duplicate letters, but so far no feedback suggests duplicates.

So assume no duplicates.

So if O is in position 1, then the word is O A ? ? ?

And R must be in 3,4, or 5.

And the other two positions with new letters.

For example, ""OAKER"" not valid.

""OARED"" has E.

""OASIS"" has I.

""OAVES"" has E.

""OARIC"" has C.

Not many common words with O in 1, A in 2, and R, without forbidden letters.

""BOARD"" has B, O, A, R, D -> O in 1? Actually, ""BOARD"" is B in 1, O in 2? But we need A in 2, so O in 1 and A in 2: ""O A ? ? ?""

""OARED"" is the only one I can think of, but E is forbidden.

""OAKUM"" no R.

So perhaps O in position 1 is less likely because of few words.

Similarly, O in position 3: then word is ? A O ? ?

And R must be in 4 or 5 (since not 1,2, and 3 is taken by O).

For example, ""HAROS"" not a word.

""FAROS"" has F, A, R, O, S -> but if O in 3: F A O R S? That would be F in 1, A in 2, O in 3, R in 4, S in 5.

But we have R in position 4, which is possible, and O in 3, which is possible.

""FAROS"" is a word? Faro is a game, but FAROS might be plural? Not sure.

""TAROS"" has T, forbidden.

""BARON"" has N.

""CAROM"" has C.

""MAJOR"" has J, but O in 3? M A J O R -> O in 4, not 3.

If O in position 3: ? A O ? ?

With R in 4 or 5.

""GAOLS"" G A O L S -> O in 3, but no R.

""PAOLO"" has duplicate O? P A O L O, but duplicate O and no R.

Not many options.

Therefore, it's more likely that O is in position 4 and R in position 3 or 5, or O in position 1 is rare.

So in our guess, we can assume O is not in 1 for now, and test O in 4 and R in 3 or 5.

Back to ""SAVOR"": S A V O R

This has:
- S in 1: tests S
- A in 2: correct
- V in 3: tests V
- O in 4: tests O in position 4
- R in 5: tests R in position 5

If we get feedback that O is not in 4 or R not in 5, we know they must be in other positions.

Similarly, ""VALOR"" has V in 1, A in 2, L in 3, O in 4, R in 5.

But ""SAVOR"" tests S instead of L, and S is more common.

Another word: ""SABOR"" is not English, I think.

""SAVOR"" is a word meaning to enjoy.

We also have ""SHARO"" but not standard.

So I think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice.

But let's see if we can test a word that covers more possibilities.

For example, if we put O in position 1: but we don't have a good word.

What about ""OAKUM"" no R.

So perhaps skip that.

Another idea: ""ROWDY"" but no A in 2.

We must have A in 2.

So I think ""SAVOR"" is fine.

But we have another option: ""DOZAR"" not a word.

""SOAPY"" no R and A in 3.

I think we should go with ""SAVOR"".

But let's confirm the feedback we might get.

If the secret word has O in 4 and R in 5, then ""SAVOR"" would get A correct, and O and R correct if in those positions, or wrong position if not.

But we don't know.

We could choose a word that has R in position 3 and O in position 4, like ""PAROL"".

""PAROL"" has P and L.

But S is more common than P and L? S is very common.

In terms of frequency, S is more common than V, P, L.

But we are testing two letters: in ""SAVOR"" we test S and V.

In ""PAROL"" we test P and L.

S is the most common consonant, so testing S is good.

Moreover, if S is in the word, we get information.

Similarly, V is less common, but we have to test it.

Another word: ""SALVO"" -> S, A, L, V, O. 
- A in 2: good.
- O in 5? But O cannot be in position 5. So invalid.

""SAVOY"" -> S, A, V, O, Y. 
- O in 4? S A V O Y -> O in 4, Y in 5. 
- But no R? We must include R. So invalid.

Therefore, ""SAVOR"" seems the best.

But ""SAVOR"" has R in position 5, which we are testing.

We could test R in position 3.

For example, ""SAROD"" -> S, A, R, O, D. 
- A in 2: good.
- R in 3: testing R in 3.
- O in 4: testing O in 4.
- D in 5: new.

This tests S, R in 3, O in 4, and D.

But ""SAROD"" is a musical instrument, might be acceptable.

But ""SAVOR"" is more common.

I think either is fine.

But let's choose ""SAVOR"" for the third guess.

So the word is S A V O R.

But let me write it: positions 1:S, 2:A, 3:V, 4:O, 5:R.

We are testing:
- S in 1
- V in 3
- O in 4 (if O is in 4, we get ✓, else if O is elsewhere, we get - or x? But O is in the word, so if not in 4, we get - for O)
- R in 5 (similarly)

This should give us good information.

So I'll go with ""SAVOR"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(absent), R(present but wrong position), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(absent).  
  - This means:  
    - R and A are in the secret word, but R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.  
    - C, N, and E are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: RATIO** → Feedback: R(present but wrong position), A(correct position), T(absent), I(absent), O(present but wrong position).  
  - This means:  
    - A is confirmed in position 2.  
    - R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was marked as wrong position in the second guess, and we already knew it wasn't in position 2 from the first guess).  
    - O is in the word but not in position 5.  
    - T and I are not in the word.  

### Key Insights:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ _ _` (A is fixed in position 2).  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A (position 2), R, and O.  
- **R constraints**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5).  
- **O constraints**: Cannot be in position 5 (must be in 1, 3, or 4).  
- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I (cannot appear in any position).  
- **Goal for next guess**:  
  - Must include R and O (since they are confirmed present).  
  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, V) to gather more information.  
  - Avoid absent letters (C, N, E, T, I).  
  - Prioritize words that test R and O in possible positions (e.g., R in 3/4/5, O in 1/3/4).  

### Why ""SAVOR""?
- **Structure**: S (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), V (position 3), O (position 4), R (position 5).  
- **Advantages**:  
  - Tests R in position 5 (a possible position) and O in position 4 (a possible position).  
  - Introduces two new common consonants: S (very high frequency) and V (less common but useful for elimination).  
  - Avoids all absent letters (C, N, E, T, I).  
  - If R or O are not in the guessed positions, the feedback will help narrow down their locations (e.g., if O is not in position 4, it must be in 1 or 3).  
- **Alternative considered**: ""VALOR"" was also evaluated, but ""SAVOR"" is preferred because S is a more common letter than V, increasing the chance of gaining useful information.  

This guess maximizes information by testing key constraints and exploring new letters efficiently.

But we don\'t know about D, I, O. Also, we test I and O which are vowels. However, we have to avoid E, but I and O are new.\n  - But note: we have R in position 1 (which we haven\'t tested) and A in position 2 (which we haven\'t tested for A). This seems good.\n\nBut wait, we also want to test more common consonants. ""RADIO"" has two vowels (A and I, O) and only one consonant (R, D). Maybe not the best for information.\n\n- ""PARTS"": P, A, R, T, S. \n  - A in position 2? That\'s allowed (since we only know A is not in 3). \n  - R in position 3? That\'s allowed (since we only know R is not in 2). \n  - Also, we test P, T, S which are common.\n\nBut let\'s check the positions: \n- P in 1, A in 2, R in 3, T in 4, S in 5.\n\nWe haven\'t tested position 1, 4, 5 at all.

R is not in 2, so position 3 is new for R.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nAnother candidate: ""TRAIL"" -> T, R, A, I, L.\n- T in 1, R in 2 -> but R in position 2 is not allowed because we already tried R in position 2 and it was present but wrong position? Actually, we know R is in the word but not in position 2. So we cannot put R in position 2 again because it would be a waste. We must put R in a new position.\n\nIn ""TRAIL"", R is in position 2 again. That would be a mistake because we already know it\'s not there. So we avoid that.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot put A in position 3.\n\nSo ""TRAIL"" is invalid because R is in position 2.\n\nAnother word: ""ROAST"" -> R in 1, O in 2, A in 3?

But E is not allowed because we know E is not in the word. So invalid.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nSimilarly, ""CARET"" has C and E -> invalid.\n\nSo back to ""PARTS"": it has no forbidden letters and tests P, T, S.\n\nBut let me confirm: P, A, R, T, S.\n\nPositions:\n- P in 1: new\n- A in 2: new for A (we only know A is not in 3, so 2 is untested)\n- R in 3: new for R (we only know R is not in 2, so 3 is untested)\n- T in 4: new\n- S in 5: new\n\nThis will give us information about these positions and letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""RANTS"" -> but N is forbidden (we know N is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n""MAILS"" -> but no R? We must include R because we know R is in the word. And also A. So the word must have R and A.\n\nSo ""MAILS"" doesn\'t have R -> invalid.\n\nWe must include both R and A.\n\nAnother word: ""TARES"" -> but E is forbidden. Invalid.\n\n""BARKS"" -> B, A, R, K, S. \n- A in 2? Allowed. \n- R in 3? Allowed. \n- B, K, S are new.\n\nBut K is less common than T or S? Maybe.\n\n""PARKS"" -> similar.\n\nBut I think ""PARTS"" is better because T is more common than K.\n\nWe could also try to test a vowel. We haven\'t tested I, O, U.\n\nFor example, ""RAPID"": R in 1, A in 2, P in 3, I in 4, D in 5. \n- This tests I and D. \n- But we are not testing S or T.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we want to test as many common letters as possible.\n\nThe most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. But we know E and N are out, so next are T, A (we have A), O, I, S, H, R (we have R), D, L, U.\n\nSo we should test T, O, I, S, etc.\n\nIn ""PARTS"", we test P, A (already known), R (known), T, S. So we are testing P, T, S.\n\nP is not as common as T or S. T and S are very common.\n\nAnother word: ""STARS"" -> S, T, A, R, S. But it has duplicate S? And A is in position 3? Not allowed for A.\n\n""ARTSY"" -> A in 1, R in 2? But R cannot be in position 2. So invalid.\n\n""RATIO"": R in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, O in 5. \n- This tests T, I, O. \n- Positions: A in 2 (new), R in 1 (new), T in 3, I in 4, O in 5.\n\nThis tests three new vowels (I, O) and T (common consonant). And we avoid the forbidden positions.\n\nThis might be even better because we get information about vowels.\n\nWe know the word has A and R, but we don\'t know about vowels. The word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but likely.\n\nIn ""RATIO"", we have A, I, O as vowels and R, T as consonants.\n\nThis covers more vowels.\n\nAlternatively, ""RADIO"" is similar but with D instead of T. T is more common than D.\n\nSo ""RATIO"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check: we are putting R in position 1 and A in position 2. We haven\'t tested these positions for R and A.\n\nWe know R is in the word but not in position 2, so position 1 is a possibility. Similarly, A is in the word but not in position 3, so position 2 is a possibility.\n\nSo ""RATIO"" is a valid guess.\n\nAnother option: ""ORBIT"" -> but O in 1, R in 2? R in position 2 is not allowed. So invalid.\n\n""TRIAD"": T, R, I, A, D. \n- R in position 2? Again, not allowed. Invalid.\n\nSo between ""PARTS"" and ""RATIO"", which one?\n\n""PARTS"" tests consonants: P, T, S (and known A, R)\n""RATIO"" tests vowels: I, O and consonant T (and known A, R)\n\nSince we have only tested one word and we don\'t know about vowels (we only know A is present, but there might be other vowels), testing two vowels (I and O) might be beneficial.\n\nAlso, T is a very common consonant.\n\nMoreover, ""RATIO"" is a common word.\n\nSo I think ""RATIO"" is a good choice.\n\nBut note: we are not testing S, which is very common. But we can test S in the next guess if needed.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that includes S.\n\nFor example, ""RAINS"" -> but N is forbidden. Invalid.\n\n""ROAST"" -> A in position 3? Not allowed.\n\n""RASIS"" -> not a word.\n\n""RASPS"" -> duplicate S and A in 2? But A in 2 is allowed, but duplicate S might not be ideal.\n\n""RASPS"": R in 1, A in 2, S in 3, P in 4, S in 5. Duplicate S, which might not be efficient.\n\n""TRAYS"" -> T, R, A, Y, S. But R in position 2? Not allowed.\n\n""SATYR"" -> S, A, T, Y, R. \n- A in position 2? Allowed. \n- R in position 5? Allowed. \n- But Y is less common and the word is uncommon.\n\nNot ideal.\n\n""STAIR"" -> S, T, A, I, R. \n- A in position 3? Not allowed. Invalid.\n\n""TAROT"" -> T, A, R, O, T. \n- A in position 2? Allowed. \n- R in position 3? Allowed. \n- But duplicate T? And O is a vowel.\n\nBut duplicate T might not be good.\n\nSo ""RATIO"" seems a solid choice.\n\nAnother one: ""AUDIO"" -> but no R? We must include R. So invalid.\n\nTherefore, I will go with ""RATIO"".\n\nSo the second guess is ""RATIO"".<thinking>\nWe have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"": \n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- A: - (in the word but wrong position)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word contains R and A, but not in the positions guessed (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).\n2. The letters C, N, and E are absent from the secret word.\n3. For the next guess:\n   - Must include R and A (since they are confirmed present).\n   - Avoid C, N, E.\n   - R cannot be in position 2 (already tested and wrong).\n   - A cannot be in position 3 (already tested and wrong).\n   - Should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, O, S) to gather more information.\n\nStrategy for the second guess:\n- Choose a word with R and A in new positions (R not in position 2, A not in position 3).\n- Include other high-frequency letters not yet tested (like T, I, O) to maximize information gain.\n- Avoid letters known to be absent (C, N, E).\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""RATIO"" is a strong candidate because:\n  - Contains R (position 1) and A (position 2), both in new untested positions.\n  - Tests new common letters: T (position 3), I (position 4), O (position 5).\n  - Avoids forbidden letters (C, N, E).\n  - Provides broad coverage of vowels (A, I, O) and consonants (R, T).\n\nThis guess will help narrow down the positions of R and A while testing three new letters.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>RATIO</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: x (not in the word)\n\nGuess 2: RATIO\n- R: - (in the word, but not in position 1)  [since we guessed R in position 1 and got \'-\']\n- A: ✓ (correct, in position 2)\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- I: x (not in the word)\n- O: - (in the word, but not in position 5)\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n\n1. The secret word has the letter A in position 2 (because A in ""RATIO"" was correct).\n2. The letter R is in the word, but not in position 1 or 2 (since we tried position 1 in the second guess and it was wrong, and position 2 in the first guess was also wrong).\n3. The letter O is in the word, but not in position 5.\n4. The letters C, N, E, T, I are not in the word.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we know R is not in position 2 and A is not in position 3, but now we know A is fixed in position 2.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Position 2 is A.\n\nLetters in the word: A (in pos 2), R (somewhere, but not pos 1 or 2), O (somewhere, not pos 5).\n\nLetters not in the word: C, N, E, T, I.\n\nWe have 5 positions: _ A _ _ _\n\nR must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5 (since not 1 or 2).\n\nO must be in one of positions 1, 3, or 4 (since not 5).\n\nWe need to make a third guess. We should try to find a word that:\n\n- Has A in position 2 (fixed).\n- Includes R and O (since they are in the word, and we need to find their positions).\n- Avoids C, N, E, T, I.\n- Tests new common letters to get more information.\n\nPossible positions for R: 3,4,5\nPossible positions for O: 1,3,4\n\nBut note: if we put O in position 3 or 4, and R in position 3 or 4, they might conflict? But they are different letters, so they can be in the same word.\n\nWe also want to test other common letters that we haven\'t tried. The letters we haven\'t tried and are common: S, L, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe should avoid using letters we know are not in the word.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: we can use any letter except C, N, E, T, I, and also we know A, R, O are in the word, so we must include them.\n\nThe word must have A in position 2, and also R and O.\n\nSo the word pattern: [letter1] A [letter3] [letter4] [letter5]\n\nWith:\n- letter1: can be any except C, N, E, T, I, and must be a letter we haven\'t ruled out. Also, O could be here.\n- letter3: can be R or O or a new letter, but note R and O must be placed somewhere. Also, we know A is not in position 3 (from first guess, but now we have A in 2, so position 3 is open). But we must place R and O in the remaining positions: 1,3,4,5, but with constraints: R not in 1, O not in 5, and R must be in 3,4,5 and O in 1,3,4.\n\nSo the positions for R and O must be assigned to three positions: 1,3,4,5, but with:\n- R: 3,4,5\n- O: 1,3,4\n\nSo position 1 can only be O (if O is there) or a new letter? But O can be in 1, so if O is in 1, then R must be in 3,4, or 5. If O is in 3, then R can be in 4 or 5 (since 3 is taken). Similarly, if O is in 4, R can be in 3 or 5.\n\nWe also have to fill the remaining positions with new letters that are not forbidden.\n\nWe want to maximize information, so we should try to test R and O in positions that are possible and also test new common letters.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit: [O?] A [R? or O?] [R? or O?] [R?]\n\nFor example:\n- If we put O in position 1: then word starts with O, then A in 2, then we need to place R in 3,4, or 5, and the other two positions with new letters.\n\nBut we don\'t know if O is in position 1.\n\nSimilarly, we could put R in position 3, etc.\n\nWe should consider common words.\n\nList of possible words with A in position 2 and containing R and O, without C, N, E, T, I.\n\nCommon letters to try: S, L, D, M, P, U, etc.\n\nFor example:\n- ""OASIS"" -> but has S and I? I is forbidden. Also, duplicate S? And we don\'t know about S. But I is not allowed.\n\nI is forbidden, so we cannot use I.\n\nSimilarly, ""OAKUM"" -> but K and U? And no R? We need R.\n\nWe must have R.\n\n""ROARS"" -> but R in position 1? We know R cannot be in position 1 (from second guess feedback: R in position 1 was wrong). Also, A in position 3? But we have A fixed in position 2, so not.\n\nWe have A in position 2, so the word must be ? A ? ? ?\n\n""PAROL"" -> P, A, R, O, L. \n- A in 2: good.\n- R in 3: possible (since R can be in 3,4,5)\n- O in 4: possible (O can be in 1,3,4, but here in 4)\n- L in 5: new letter.\n- But we have P in 1: new letter.\n\nThis word: P A R O L\n\nCheck the letters: P, A, R, O, L.

From feedback, O is not in position 5 (from second guess, O in position 5 was wrong). So O cannot be in 5. Therefore, ""FARGO"" has O in 5 -> invalid.\n\n""DOGMA"" -> D, O, G, M, A. But A is in position 5, not 2. We need A in position 2. Invalid.\n\n""LOAMY"" -> L, O, A, M, Y. A in position 3? Not 2.

We might get feedback that R is elsewhere.\n\nAnother possibility: ""OARED"" -> but E is forbidden. Invalid.\n\n""SOAPY"" -> S, O, A, P, Y. \n- O in 1: possible (O can be in 1)\n- A in 3?

R in position 5 is allowed (since we haven\'t tried position 5 for R).\n\nAnother word: ""MANOR"" -> M, A, N, O, R. But N is forbidden. Invalid.\n\n""LABOR"" -> L, A, B, O, R. \n- A in 2: good.\n- B in 3: new\n- O in 4: good\n- R in 5: good\n\nThis tests L and B.\n\nBut B is less common than some other letters.\n\n""SAVOR"" -> S, A, V, O, R. \n- S in 1: new\n- A in 2: good\n- V in 3: new\n- O in 4: good\n- R in 5: good\n\nThis tests S and V.\n\nS is a very common letter, so testing S is good.\n\nSimilarly, ""PAPER"" has E and P, but E forbidden.\n\n""WAVER"" has E.\n\nSo ""SAVOR"" is a good candidate.\n\nBut let\'s compare to ""PAROL"" and ""VALOR"".\n\nWe have several options:\n\n1. PAROL: tests P and L, with R in 3 and O in 4.\n2. VALOR: tests V and L, with O in 4 and R in 5.\n3. SAVOR: tests S and V, with O in 4 and R in 5.\n\nSince S is more common than V or P, ""SAVOR"" might be better.\n\nBut note: we also have the possibility that O is in position 1 or 3.\n\nIn ""SAVOR"", we are assuming O is in 4 and R in 5, but if O is actually in 1, we won\'t know.\n\nWe need to consider that O could be in position 1.\n\nFor example, if the word is ""OASIS"", but I is forbidden, so not.\n\nWhat words have O in position 1, A in 2, and R and O? But O is only once? Or duplicate?\n\nWe don\'t know if there are duplicate letters, but so far no feedback suggests duplicates.\n\nSo assume no duplicates.\n\nSo if O is in position 1, then the word is O A ? ? ?\n\nAnd R must be in 3,4, or 5.\n\nAnd the other two positions with new letters.\n\nFor example, ""OAKER"" not valid.\n\n""OARED"" has E.\n\n""OASIS"" has I.\n\n""OAVES"" has E.\n\n""OARIC"" has C.\n\nNot many common words with O in 1, A in 2, and R, without forbidden letters.\n\n""BOARD"" has B, O, A, R, D -> O in 1? Actually, ""BOARD"" is B in 1, O in 2? But we need A in 2, so O in 1 and A in 2: ""O A ? ? ?""\n\n""OARED"" is the only one I can think of, but E is forbidden.\n\n""OAKUM"" no R.\n\nSo perhaps O in position 1 is less likely because of few words.\n\nSimilarly, O in position 3: then word is ? A O ? ?\n\nAnd R must be in 4 or 5 (since not 1,2, and 3 is taken by O).\n\nFor example, ""HAROS"" not a word.\n\n""FAROS"" has F, A, R, O, S -> but if O in 3: F A O R S? That would be F in 1, A in 2, O in 3, R in 4, S in 5.\n\nBut we have R in position 4, which is possible, and O in 3, which is possible.\n\n""FAROS"" is a word? Faro is a game, but FAROS might be plural? Not sure.\n\n""TAROS"" has T, forbidden.\n\n""BARON"" has N.\n\n""CAROM"" has C.\n\n""MAJOR"" has J, but O in 3? M A J O R -> O in 4, not 3.\n\nIf O in position 3: ? A O ? ?\n\nWith R in 4 or 5.\n\n""GAOLS"" G A O L S -> O in 3, but no R.\n\n""PAOLO"" has duplicate O? P A O L O, but duplicate O and no R.\n\nNot many options.\n\nTherefore, it\'s more likely that O is in position 4 and R in position 3 or 5, or O in position 1 is rare.\n\nSo in our guess, we can assume O is not in 1 for now, and test O in 4 and R in 3 or 5.\n\nBack to ""SAVOR"": S A V O R\n\nThis has:\n- S in 1: tests S\n- A in 2: correct\n- V in 3: tests V\n- O in 4: tests O in position 4\n- R in 5: tests R in position 5\n\nIf we get feedback that O is not in 4 or R not in 5, we know they must be in other positions.\n\nSimilarly, ""VALOR"" has V in 1, A in 2, L in 3, O in 4, R in 5.\n\nBut ""SAVOR"" tests S instead of L, and S is more common.\n\nAnother word: ""SABOR"" is not English, I think.\n\n""SAVOR"" is a word meaning to enjoy.\n\nWe also have ""SHARO"" but not standard.\n\nSo I think ""SAVOR"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can test a word that covers more possibilities.\n\nFor example, if we put O in position 1: but we don\'t have a good word.\n\nWhat about ""OAKUM"" no R.\n\nSo perhaps skip that.\n\nAnother idea: ""ROWDY"" but no A in 2.\n\nWe must have A in 2.\n\nSo I think ""SAVOR"" is fine.\n\nBut we have another option: ""DOZAR"" not a word.\n\n""SOAPY"" no R and A in 3.\n\nI think we should go with ""SAVOR"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we might get.\n\nIf the secret word has O in 4 and R in 5, then ""SAVOR"" would get A correct, and O and R correct if in those positions, or wrong position if not.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nWe could choose a word that has R in position 3 and O in position 4, like ""PAROL"".\n\n""PAROL"" has P and L.\n\nBut S is more common than P and L? S is very common.\n\nIn terms of frequency, S is more common than V, P, L.\n\nBut we are testing two letters: in ""SAVOR"" we test S and V.\n\nIn ""PAROL"" we test P and L.\n\nS is the most common consonant, so testing S is good.\n\nMoreover, if S is in the word, we get information.\n\nSimilarly, V is less common, but we have to test it.\n\nAnother word: ""SALVO"" -> S, A, L, V, O. \n- A in 2: good.\n- O in 5? But O cannot be in position 5. So invalid.\n\n""SAVOY"" -> S, A, V, O, Y. \n- O in 4? S A V O Y -> O in 4, Y in 5. \n- But no R? We must include R. So invalid.\n\nTherefore, ""SAVOR"" seems the best.\n\nBut ""SAVOR"" has R in position 5, which we are testing.\n\nWe could test R in position 3.\n\nFor example, ""SAROD"" -> S, A, R, O, D. \n- A in 2: good.\n- R in 3: testing R in 3.\n- O in 4: testing O in 4.\n- D in 5: new.\n\nThis tests S, R in 3, O in 4, and D.\n\nBut ""SAROD"" is a musical instrument, might be acceptable.\n\nBut ""SAVOR"" is more common.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""SAVOR"" for the third guess.\n\nSo the word is S A V O R.\n\nBut let me write it: positions 1:S, 2:A, 3:V, 4:O, 5:R.\n\nWe are testing:\n- S in 1\n- V in 3\n- O in 4 (if O is in 4, we get ✓, else if O is elsewhere, we get - or x? But O is in the word, so if not in 4, we get - for O)\n- R in 5 (similarly)\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SAVOR"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: CRANE** → Feedback: C(absent), R(present but wrong position), A(present but wrong position), N(absent), E(absent).  \n  - This means:  \n    - R and A are in the secret word, but R is not in position 2, and A is not in position 3.  \n    - C, N, and E are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: RATIO** → Feedback: R(present but wrong position), A(correct position), T(absent), I(absent), O(present but wrong position).  \n  - This means:  \n    - A is confirmed in position 2.  \n    - R is in the word but not in position 1 (since it was marked as wrong position in the second guess, and we already knew it wasn\'t in position 2 from the first guess).  \n    - O is in the word but not in position 5.  \n    - T and I are not in the word.  \n\n### Key Insights:\n- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ _ _` (A is fixed in position 2).  \n- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A (position 2), R, and O.  \n- **R constraints**: Cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (must be in 3, 4, or 5).  \n- **O constraints**: Cannot be in position 5 (must be in 1, 3, or 4).  \n- **Absent letters**: C, N, E, T, I (cannot appear in any position).  \n- **Goal for next guess**:  \n  - Must include R and O (since they are confirmed present).  \n  - Test new common letters (e.g., S, V) to gather more information.  \n  - Avoid absent letters (C, N, E, T, I).  \n  - Prioritize words that test R and O in possible positions (e.g., R in 3/4/5, O in 1/3/4).  \n\n### Why ""SAVOR""?\n- **Structure**: S (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), V (position 3), O (position 4), R (position 5).  \n- **Advantages**:  \n  - Tests R in position 5 (a possible position) and O in position 4 (a possible position).  \n  - Introduces two new common consonants: S (very high frequency) and V (less common but useful for elimination).  \n  - Avoids all absent letters (C, N, E, T, I).  \n  - If R or O are not in the guessed positions, the feedback will help narrow down their locations (e.g., if O is not in position 4, it must be in 1 or 3).  \n- **Alternative considered**: ""VALOR"" was also evaluated, but ""SAVOR"" is preferred because S is a more common letter than V, increasing the chance of gaining useful information.  \n\nThis guess maximizes information by testing key constraints and exploring new letters efficiently.\n\n<guess>SAVOR</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: RATIO -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(✓) T(x) I(x) O(-)\nGuess 3: SAVOR -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) V(✓) O(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: RATIO
- R: present, wrong position (-)  [tried position 1]
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- T: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- O: present, wrong position (-)  [tried position 5]

Guess 3: SAVOR
- S: absent (x)
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- V: correct (✓) in position 3
- O: correct (✓) in position 4
- R: correct (✓) in position 5

Now, from the latest feedback (SAVOR), we have:
- A is confirmed in position 2 (already knew from guess 2)
- V is correct in position 3 (new information)
- O is correct in position 4 (new information)
- R is correct in position 5 (new information)
- S is absent (so S is not in the word)

Also, from previous guesses, we know:
- The secret word has A in position 2, V in position 3, O in position 4, R in position 5.
- The only missing letter is the first letter (position 1).

So the secret word pattern is: [letter] A V O R

We know the first letter must be a letter that:
- Is not C, N, E, T, I, S (these are absent from previous feedback)
- And it must form a valid English word.

We also know from guess 1 that R was present but not in position 2 (which is consistent because now R is in 5) and A was present but not in 3 (consistent, A is in 2).

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word of the form ?AVOR.

What are possible words?
- FAVOR: F is a possible letter? We haven't ruled out F.
- But we must check if F is allowed. From previous feedback, we have no 'F' tested, so it's possible.

List of common words ending with ""AVOR"":
- FAVOR
- SAVOR (but we tried SAVOR and S is absent, so not SAVOR)
- HAVOR? Not a common word.
- PAVOR? Not common.
- LAVOR? Not common.
- RAVOR? Not a word.

So the most common word is FAVOR.

But is there any other?

Another one: ""HAVOC"" is not ending with R.

""Behavior"" is 8 letters.

So FAVOR seems the only common word.

But let's confirm: FAVOR is a valid 5-letter word.

We also have ""VAPOR"", but V is already in position 3, and in VAPOR, V is in position 1, which conflicts.

In our pattern, position 3 is V, so VAPOR would be V A P O R, which has A in 2, but V in 1, not 3. So not matching.

Similarly, ""SAVOR"" we tried and S is absent.

Therefore, the only common word that fits ?AVOR is FAVOR.

But we must ensure F is not forbidden. From previous feedback, we have not tested F, and it is not in the list of absent letters (C, N, E, T, I, S). So F is allowed.

Therefore, the secret word is likely FAVOR.

But we have to make a guess. Since we have only one position to guess and we have 4 letters fixed, we can guess FAVOR.

But note: we have 6 tries, and this is the fourth guess. We can guess FAVOR and if correct, we win.

But to be thorough, are there any other possibilities?

What about ""KAVOR""? Not a word.

""MAVOR""? Not common, but ""MAJOR"" has J and we know I is absent, but J is not tested? But in ""MAJOR"", it would be M A J O R, which has J in position 3, but we need V in position 3. So not.

Similarly, ""NAVOR"" has N, which is absent.

""RAVOR"" not a word.

""WAVOR"" not a word.

""DAVOR"" not a word.

So FAVOR is the only common English word that fits the pattern ?AVOR.

Therefore, we should guess FAVOR.

But let's double-check the feedback to ensure consistency.

If the word is FAVOR:
- For guess 1: CRANE
  - C: absent (correct, not in FAVOR)
  - R: present but wrong position (in FAVOR, R is in position 5, not 2, so correct feedback)
  - A: present but wrong position (in FAVOR, A is in position 2, but we guessed in position 3, so wrong position, correct feedback)
  - N: absent (correct)
  - E: absent (correct)

- Guess 2: RATIO
  - R: present but wrong position (we guessed position 1, but in FAVOR, R is in 5, so correct)
  - A: correct in position 2 (yes)
  - T: absent (FAVOR has no T, correct)
  - I: absent (correct)
  - O: present but wrong position (we guessed position 5, but in FAVOR, O is in 4, so wrong position, correct feedback)

- Guess 3: SAVOR
  - S: absent (FAVOR has no S, correct)
  - A: correct (position 2)
  - V: correct (position 3)
  - O: correct (position 4)
  - R: correct (position 5)

All feedback matches.

So the secret word is FAVOR.

Therefore, for the fourth guess, we guess FAVOR.
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

1. **Secret Word Pattern**:  
   - Position 2 is **A** (confirmed in Guess 2 and 3).  
   - Position 3 is **V** (confirmed in Guess 3).  
   - Position 4 is **O** (confirmed in Guess 3).  
   - Position 5 is **R** (confirmed in Guess 3).  
   - Position 1 is the only unknown letter.  
   - The word pattern is: `[?] A V O R`.

2. **Absent Letters (cannot be in the word)**:  
   - **C, N, E** (from Guess 1).  
   - **T, I** (from Guess 2).  
   - **S** (from Guess 3).  

3. **Possible Words**:  
   - The only common English word fitting `?AVOR` is **FAVOR**.  
   - **F** has not been tested and is not ruled out by previous feedback.  
   - Other combinations (e.g., `HAVOR`, `PAVOR`, `LAVOR`) are not valid words.  

4. **Why FAVOR?**  
   - It matches all confirmed positions (A in 2, V in 3, O in 4, R in 5).  
   - It uses **F**, a new letter not previously tested.  
   - It is consistent with all prior feedback (e.g., no C, N, E, T, I, S).  

This guess will either be correct or (if incorrect) will reveal the true first letter, but given the constraints, **FAVOR** is the only feasible solution.

<guess>FAVOR</guess>",FAVOR,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: absent (x)
- R: present, wrong position (-)
- A: present, wrong position (-)
- N: absent (x)
- E: absent (x)

Guess 2: RATIO
- R: present, wrong position (-)  [tried position 1]
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- T: absent (x)
- I: absent (x)
- O: present, wrong position (-)  [tried position 5]

Guess 3: SAVOR
- S: absent (x)
- A: correct (✓) in position 2
- V: correct (✓) in position 3
- O: correct (✓) in position 4
- R: correct (✓) in position 5

Now, from the latest feedback (SAVOR), we have:
- A is confirmed in position 2 (already knew from guess 2)
- V is correct in position 3 (new information)
- O is correct in position 4 (new information)
- R is correct in position 5 (new information)
- S is absent (so S is not in the word)

Also, from previous guesses, we know:
- The secret word has A in position 2, V in position 3, O in position 4, R in position 5.
- The only missing letter is the first letter (position 1).

So the secret word pattern is: [letter] A V O R

We know the first letter must be a letter that:
- Is not C, N, E, T, I, S (these are absent from previous feedback)
- And it must form a valid English word.

We also know from guess 1 that R was present but not in position 2 (which is consistent because now R is in 5) and A was present but not in 3 (consistent, A is in 2).

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word of the form ?AVOR.

What are possible words?
- FAVOR: F is a possible letter? We haven't ruled out F.
- But we must check if F is allowed. From previous feedback, we have no 'F' tested, so it's possible.

List of common words ending with ""AVOR"":
- FAVOR
- SAVOR (but we tried SAVOR and S is absent, so not SAVOR)
- HAVOR? Not a common word.
- PAVOR? Not common.
- LAVOR? Not common.
- RAVOR? Not a word.

So the most common word is FAVOR.

But is there any other?

Another one: ""HAVOC"" is not ending with R.

""Behavior"" is 8 letters.

So FAVOR seems the only common word.

But let's confirm: FAVOR is a valid 5-letter word.

We also have ""VAPOR"", but V is already in position 3, and in VAPOR, V is in position 1, which conflicts.

In our pattern, position 3 is V, so VAPOR would be V A P O R, which has A in 2, but V in 1, not 3. So not matching.

Similarly, ""SAVOR"" we tried and S is absent.

Therefore, the only common word that fits ?AVOR is FAVOR.

But we must ensure F is not forbidden. From previous feedback, we have not tested F, and it is not in the list of absent letters (C, N, E, T, I, S). So F is allowed.

Therefore, the secret word is likely FAVOR.

But we have to make a guess. Since we have only one position to guess and we have 4 letters fixed, we can guess FAVOR.

But note: we have 6 tries, and this is the fourth guess. We can guess FAVOR and if correct, we win.

But to be thorough, are there any other possibilities?

What about ""KAVOR""? Not a word.

""MAVOR""? Not common, but ""MAJOR"" has J and we know I is absent, but J is not tested? But in ""MAJOR"", it would be M A J O R, which has J in position 3, but we need V in position 3. So not.

Similarly, ""NAVOR"" has N, which is absent.

""RAVOR"" not a word.

""WAVOR"" not a word.

""DAVOR"" not a word.

So FAVOR is the only common English word that fits the pattern ?AVOR.

Therefore, we should guess FAVOR.

But let's double-check the feedback to ensure consistency.

If the word is FAVOR:
- For guess 1: CRANE
  - C: absent (correct, not in FAVOR)
  - R: present but wrong position (in FAVOR, R is in position 5, not 2, so correct feedback)
  - A: present but wrong position (in FAVOR, A is in position 2, but we guessed in position 3, so wrong position, correct feedback)
  - N: absent (correct)
  - E: absent (correct)

- Guess 2: RATIO
  - R: present but wrong position (we guessed position 1, but in FAVOR, R is in 5, so correct)
  - A: correct in position 2 (yes)
  - T: absent (FAVOR has no T, correct)
  - I: absent (correct)
  - O: present but wrong position (we guessed position 5, but in FAVOR, O is in 4, so wrong position, correct feedback)

- Guess 3: SAVOR
  - S: absent (FAVOR has no S, correct)
  - A: correct (position 2)
  - V: correct (position 3)
  - O: correct (position 4)
  - R: correct (position 5)

All feedback matches.

So the secret word is FAVOR.

Therefore, for the fourth guess, we guess FAVOR.Based on the feedback from all previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

1. **Secret Word Pattern**:  
   - Position 2 is **A** (confirmed in Guess 2 and 3).  
   - Position 3 is **V** (confirmed in Guess 3).  
   - Position 4 is **O** (confirmed in Guess 3).  
   - Position 5 is **R** (confirmed in Guess 3).  
   - Position 1 is the only unknown letter.  
   - The word pattern is: `[?] A V O R`.

2. **Absent Letters (cannot be in the word)**:  
   - **C, N, E** (from Guess 1).  
   - **T, I** (from Guess 2).  
   - **S** (from Guess 3).  

3. **Possible Words**:  
   - The only common English word fitting `?AVOR` is **FAVOR**.  
   - **F** has not been tested and is not ruled out by previous feedback.  
   - Other combinations (e.g., `HAVOR`, `PAVOR`, `LAVOR`) are not valid words.  

4. **Why FAVOR?**  
   - It matches all confirmed positions (A in 2, V in 3, O in 4, R in 5).  
   - It uses **F**, a new letter not previously tested.  
   - It is consistent with all prior feedback (e.g., no C, N, E, T, I, S).  

This guess will either be correct or (if incorrect) will reveal the true first letter, but given the constraints, **FAVOR** is the only feasible solution.",Guess 4: FAVOR -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) A(✓) V(✓) O(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
