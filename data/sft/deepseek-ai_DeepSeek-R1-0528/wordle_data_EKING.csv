We are starting a new game. We have to make the first guess. Since there's no feedback yet, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Typically, words with common letters and no repeating letters are good for first guesses.

Common starting words in Wordle include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- REAST
- TRACE
- SALET

But note: We are limited to 5-letter words. I recall that ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

Let's pick ""SLATE"". It has three distinct vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T). But wait, it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

Another candidate: ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the accumulated earnings that have not been paid as dividends) but might be less known.

I think ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are solid.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because I'm more familiar with it.

We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C (x): C is not in the secret word.
- R (x): R is not in the secret word.
- A (x): A is not in the secret word.
- N (✓): N is in the secret word and is in the correct position (so the fourth letter is N).
- E (-): E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position. Therefore, E must be in one of the first three positions? Wait, but note: the secret word has 5 letters.

Important: The feedback indicates:
- The fourth letter is N (position 4).
- E is in the word but not in the last position (since we guessed it at position 5 and it's wrong). Therefore, E must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or possibly 4? But position 4 is N, so E is not at position 4. Therefore, E is in position 1, 2, or 3? Or wait, position 5? But we are told it's in the wrong position for 5. Since we are told it's present but not at 5, then it must be in 1,2,3, or 4? But position 4 is taken by N? Actually, the feedback says N is at position 4 (correct), so E cannot be at position 4. Therefore, E must be at position 1,2,3, or possibly 5? But we got a dash at 5 meaning it's not at 5. So E must be in one of the positions 1 to 4, but not 4? Actually, position 4 is occupied by N, so E must be at position 1,2, or 3.

Additionally, we know that C, R, A are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Has N as the fourth letter (position 4).
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but not at position 5 (and not at position 4 because that's N).
- Does not contain C, R, or A.
- The word is 5 letters: _ _ _ N _

We need to pick a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word.
- Includes E (since we know E is in the word) but E cannot be at position 5 (and we also know it's not at position 4? Not necessarily, but we know position 4 is N). Also, from the feedback, E is not at position 5, so in our next guess we might want to put E at position 1, 2, or 3 to check.
- Does not contain C, R, or A.

Since we only have 5 tries left, we need to maximize information. We know N is fixed at position 4. We know E must be somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (or possibly 5? but we were told position 5 was wrong, so not 5? Actually: the dash at E means it is in the word but not at position 5. So E must be in 1-4 but position 4 is N so E must be in 1,2, or 3).

Therefore, the word structure: [Letter1] [Letter2] [Letter3] N [Letter5]

And E is one of Letter1, Letter2, or Letter3.

Also, we have eliminated C, R, A.

Let us think of common words that fit this pattern.

We should also try to use new letters to get more information. We have used C, R, A, N, E. Now known: N and E are in, C,R,A out.

So new guess should include E in positions 1,2, or 3, and avoid C,R,A. Also, we can try to include other common consonants or vowels.

Possible strategies: Try to place E in different positions? We don't know where E is, so we can test one of the positions.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has E and other common letters we haven't tried yet, while keeping N at position 4? But wait, we are not forced to put N at position 4? Actually, we know N is fixed at position 4, so we must keep that? Because it's correct. So our next guess must have N at position 4? Yes.

So guess structure: _ _ _ N _

And we know E is in the word but not at the last position, so we must include E either at position 1,2, or 3? Actually, we don't have to include E in this guess? But why wouldn't we? We know E is present, so we can use it to get positional information.

Also, we must not re-use C,R,A.

So we need to fill: [Letter1] [Letter2] [Letter3] N [Letter5]

And we know E must be one of L1, L2, L3? Actually, Letter5 might be E? But wait, the feedback from the first guess said that E in position5 is wrong, so E cannot be at position5? Therefore, E must be in L1, L2, or L3.

Therefore, our guess must have E at either position1, 2, or 3.

We also want to test new letters.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but avoiding C,R,A). And we haven't used O,U,I etc.

But note: we have limited knowledge, so testing multiple vowels or common consonants might be good.

Let me think of words that fit: _ _ _ N E? But wait, E cannot be at position5? So we cannot have E at the end. Therefore, the fifth letter is not E, so we need another letter.

Possible words: 
- If E is at position1: E _ _ N _
- E.g., E? The word must have E at 1 and N at 4, and then other letters. Examples: ELFIN? But check: E L F I N -> positions: E at1, N at5? But we need N at4? N at index 4? Wait, if E at1 and N at4, then word like E? ? ? N ? 

Examples: 
- E at position1: E X I N L? Not a word. How about E V E N T? Too long? 5 letters only. So E V E N T is 5? E(1)V(2)E(3)N(4)T(5). But E is at position1 and 3? We have feedback that E is in the word at least once, but it might be repeated? However, we have not ruled out duplicates.

But we must avoid using C,R,A.

Potential words with E at 1 and N at 4:
- ELAND: E-L-A-N-D -> but A is in ELAND? But we know A is not in the word. So not valid? We cannot use A. So ELAND invalid.

How about words like: 
- EGENT? E-G-E-N-T? But E at 1 and 3? And N at 4? So E G E N T -> but G and T are new. However, ELAND used A which is forbidden.

What about EGGED? E-G-G-E-D -> but positions: E(1) G(2) G(3) E(4) D(5) -> but we need N at position4? So EGGED doesn't have N. We must have N at position4.

So the third character must be ... and fourth must be N.

List: E at1, N at4: E _ _ N _
Possible words: 
- EKING: E-K-I-N-G -> positions: E(1),K(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). But EKING is a valid word? Eking (meaning to make a living with difficulty). And it has I and K. But note: our feedback said A is absent, but I is new.

But EKING uses I? That's fine.

Alternatively, E at2: _ E _ N _
Examples: 
- BENCH -> B-E-N-C-H? But C is eliminated -> invalid because of C.
- Denim -> D-E-N-I-M -> positions: D(1),E(2),N(4)? Wait no: DENIM: D(1),E(2),N(3),I(4),M(5) -> but we need N at position4? So positions: letter1: D, letter2: E, letter3: N? But we know that the feedback from CRANE showed N at position4 (the fourth letter) was correct. So the secret word has N as the fourth letter? Therefore, in DENIM, N is at position3? Not at position4. So DENIM doesn't have N at 4.

So we must have N at position4.

Therefore, for E at position2: 
Word structure: [L1] E [L3] N [L5]
Examples: 
- T E N T N? No, that would be T-E-N-T-N? Invalid.
- How about: GREEN? Would be G-R-E-E-N? G(1),R(2) -> but R is eliminated? We cannot use R. And positions: E at position3? Then E at position4? But N is at5? We need N at4. So GREEN: G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), N(5) -> then E is at position3 and4? But N is at position5? Not 4.

We need N at position4: so L1, L2, L3, N, L5.

If E at position2, then [L1] E [L3] N [L5]

Examples:
- BENCH: illegal due to C.
- DENIM: N at position3, so not at4 -> invalid structure.
- Try: P E N N Y -> P-E-N-N-Y -> but N is at3 and4, so we have N at position4? Yes: position4 is the second N? P-E-N-N-Y: indices: 1:P, 2:E, 3:N, 4:N, 5:Y. So position4 is N? Correct. But PENNY has two N's? Which is acceptable? Also, has E at position2. And avoids C,R,A? Yes.

So PENNY: P-E-N-N-Y -> letter5 is Y? And position2 is E.

But we have N at position4? Yes: the fourth letter is N. And E at 2: but is the second letter? Then the word PENNY would have E at position2 and that is valid? But in the secret word, E could be at position2? We don't know.

But PENNY has two N's? We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters? It could.

Alternatively, other words: 
- HEIST: H-E-I-S-T -> but S at4? Then no N at4? H-E-I-S-T: position1:H,2:E,3:I,4:S,5:T -> S at4, not N. So no.

- How about BEING? B-E-I-N-G -> positions: B(1),E(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). Perfect! And BEING avoids C,R,A and has E at 2 and N at4.

BEING is a valid word.

E at position3: _ _ E N _

Examples: 
- QUEEN: Q-U-E-E-N -> positions: Q(1),U(2),E(3),E(4),N(5) -> then E at3 and4? But N at5? Not at4. So not.
- GREEN: G(1),R(2),E(3),E(4),N(5) -> E at3 and4? N at5? No.
- SCENE: S-C-E-N-E -> but C is eliminated? And C is present? But we know C is not in secret word, so invalid.
- Try: STONE -> S-T-O-N-E -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),N(4),E(5). Then E is at5? But our feedback said E is not at5? So STONE has E at5? So if we choose STONE, then we are putting E at5 which we know is wrong? Therefore, in this guess, we would not set E at5? Because we know it shouldn't be?

But our goal is to test E at different positions? We know E is not at5? So we avoid putting E at5? Yes?

So for our second guess, we have several options:
1. E at position1: e.g., EKING
2. E at position2: e.g., BEING
3. E at position3: e.g., ... let's find a word. What about: OLDEN? O-L-D-E-N -> O(1),L(2),D(3),E(4),N(5) -> E at4? But we need N at4? So OLDEN has N at5? No. Then SHIRE? S-H-I-R-E -> R eliminated? and N missing.

Another example for E at3: A R E N L? Invalid. 

Try: OPIUM? But no E? 

Better: using common letters.

What about: TEPID? T-E-P-I-D -> positions: T(1),E(2),P(3),I(4),D(5) -> no N at4? Then no.

Or: MOVED? But no N.

Alternatively: UNSET? U-N-S-E-T -> U(1),N(2),S(3),E(4),T(5) -> N at2 not4.

So harder to find with E at3? How about: AWAKE? But has A? Eliminated. 

Another: CHILL? C eliminated.

Perhaps: THEFT? T-H-E-F-T -> T(1),H(2),E(3),F(4),T(5) -> F at4? Not N.

CHILI? C and I.

It might be easier to find with E at1 or E at2.

I think BEING is a good candidate: B,E,I,N,G. New letters: B, I, G.

Alternatively, EKING: E,K,I,N,G.

Note: we are not sure if E is at1 or 2? But by guessing BEING, if E is at position2? We can get feedback? Similarly, EKING tests E at1.

Since we have limited guesses, we might pick BEING because it also introduces B,I,G.

We could also consider PENNY? But PENNY has P,E,N,Y? With Y? And double N? That might be less common? But BEING is more common.

Another word: DEIGN? D-E-I-G-N -> D(1),E(2),I(3),G(4),N(5) -> N at5, not at4? So invalid.

Or: FEIGN? F-E-I-G-N -> F(1),E(2),I(3),G(4),N(5) -> again N at5.

So PENNY is one option: P,E,N,N,Y? Not ideal because repeated N? But acceptable? Or BEING.

Perhaps: HELLO? But E at2? Then O at4? No N at4.

How about MELON? M-E-L-O-N -> M(1),E(2),L(3),O(4),N(5) -> N at5? Not at4.

LEMON? L-E-M-O-N -> L(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5) -> same as above.

So BEING is a valid word: 
- B at1, E at2, I at3, N at4, G at5.

We know E is not at5? And we avoid putting E at5? So BEING has E at2? Good.

We also don't know about position5: currently G.

But we can get information about B, I, G.

So let's choose BEING.

But wait: we must ensure that E is included? Because we know E is in the word? And to verify? Actually, if we don't include E, we wouldn't test it? But we know E is present? So we think BEING is a solid guess? Because it places E at position2? So we can test if E is at2? If it isn't, then we get dash or something? Actually, if E is at1 or3? Then we would get dash for E at2? That would be helpful.

Alternatively, we could choose a word with E at a different position? But BEING also tests B, I, G and confirms E? 

Yes.

Other option: since N is fixed, we might try a word that has E and also uses more common letters? 

But BEING: B, E, I, N, G? This introduces B, I, G. 

Another option: RESET? But R is eliminated? And S at4? Not N.

Or: QUITE? Q-U-I-T-E -> too many vowels? and no N at4.

We'll go with BEING.

So my second guess: BEING

Response format: <guess>BEING</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":

- C, R, and A are not in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- N is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (indicated by ""✓"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (indicated by ""-"").

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _
- E must appear in the word but not in position 5. Given that position 4 is occupied by N, E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The word cannot contain C, R, or A.

For the next guess:
- We need a 5-letter word that includes E in position 1, 2, or 3, avoids C/R/A, and leaves position 4 as N.
- To maximize information, new letters should be introduced to test other common consonants and vowels.
- ""BEING"" is a valid word that fits:
  - B (new) at position 1
  - E (known in word) at position 2 to test if correct position
  - I (new vowel) at position 3
  - N (fixed) at position 4
  - G (new consonant) at position 5
- This guess tests E's position and covers new letters without reusing eliminated letters.

<guess>BEING</guess>",BEING,"We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C (x): C is not in the secret word.
- R (x): R is not in the secret word.
- A (x): A is not in the secret word.
- N (✓): N is in the secret word and is in the correct position (so the fourth letter is N).
- E (-): E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position. Therefore, E must be in one of the first three positions? Wait, but note: the secret word has 5 letters.

Important: The feedback indicates:
- The fourth letter is N (position 4).
- E is in the word but not in the last position (since we guessed it at position 5 and it's wrong). Therefore, E must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or possibly 4? But position 4 is N, so E is not at position 4. Therefore, E is in position 1, 2, or 3? Or wait, position 5? But we are told it's in the wrong position for 5. Since we are told it's present but not at 5, then it must be in 1,2,3, or 4? But position 4 is taken by N? Actually, the feedback says N is at position 4 (correct), so E cannot be at position 4. Therefore, E must be at position 1,2,3, or possibly 5? But we got a dash at 5 meaning it's not at 5. So E must be in one of the positions 1 to 4, but not 4? Actually, position 4 is occupied by N, so E must be at position 1,2, or 3.

Additionally, we know that C, R, A are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Has N as the fourth letter (position 4).
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but not at position 5 (and not at position 4 because that's N).
- Does not contain C, R, or A.
- The word is 5 letters: _ _ _ N _

We need to pick a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word.
- Includes E (since we know E is in the word) but E cannot be at position 5 (and we also know it's not at position 4? Not necessarily, but we know position 4 is N). Also, from the feedback, E is not at position 5, so in our next guess we might want to put E at position 1, 2, or 3 to check.
- Does not contain C, R, or A.

Since we only have 5 tries left, we need to maximize information. We know N is fixed at position 4. We know E must be somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (or possibly 5? but we were told position 5 was wrong, so not 5? Actually: the dash at E means it is in the word but not at position 5. So E must be in 1-4 but position 4 is N so E must be in 1,2, or 3).

Therefore, the word structure: [Letter1] [Letter2] [Letter3] N [Letter5]

And E is one of Letter1, Letter2, or Letter3.

Also, we have eliminated C, R, A.

Let us think of common words that fit this pattern.

We should also try to use new letters to get more information. We have used C, R, A, N, E. Now known: N and E are in, C,R,A out.

So new guess should include E in positions 1,2, or 3, and avoid C,R,A. Also, we can try to include other common consonants or vowels.

Possible strategies: Try to place E in different positions? We don't know where E is, so we can test one of the positions.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has E and other common letters we haven't tried yet, while keeping N at position 4? But wait, we are not forced to put N at position 4? Actually, we know N is fixed at position 4, so we must keep that? Because it's correct. So our next guess must have N at position 4? Yes.

So guess structure: _ _ _ N _

And we know E is in the word but not at the last position, so we must include E either at position 1,2, or 3? Actually, we don't have to include E in this guess? But why wouldn't we? We know E is present, so we can use it to get positional information.

Also, we must not re-use C,R,A.

So we need to fill: [Letter1] [Letter2] [Letter3] N [Letter5]

And we know E must be one of L1, L2, L3? Actually, Letter5 might be E? But wait, the feedback from the first guess said that E in position5 is wrong, so E cannot be at position5? Therefore, E must be in L1, L2, or L3.

Therefore, our guess must have E at either position1, 2, or 3.

We also want to test new letters.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but avoiding C,R,A). And we haven't used O,U,I etc.

But note: we have limited knowledge, so testing multiple vowels or common consonants might be good.

Let me think of words that fit: _ _ _ N E? But wait, E cannot be at position5? So we cannot have E at the end. Therefore, the fifth letter is not E, so we need another letter.

Possible words: 
- If E is at position1: E _ _ N _
- E.g., E? The word must have E at 1 and N at 4, and then other letters. Examples: ELFIN? But check: E L F I N -> positions: E at1, N at5? But we need N at4? N at index 4? Wait, if E at1 and N at4, then word like E? ? ? N ? 

Examples: 
- E at position1: E X I N L? Not a word. How about E V E N T? Too long? 5 letters only. So E V E N T is 5? E(1)V(2)E(3)N(4)T(5). But E is at position1 and 3? We have feedback that E is in the word at least once, but it might be repeated? However, we have not ruled out duplicates.

But we must avoid using C,R,A.

Potential words with E at 1 and N at 4:
- ELAND: E-L-A-N-D -> but A is in ELAND? But we know A is not in the word. So not valid? We cannot use A. So ELAND invalid.

How about words like: 
- EGENT? E-G-E-N-T? But E at 1 and 3? And N at 4? So E G E N T -> but G and T are new. However, ELAND used A which is forbidden.

What about EGGED? E-G-G-E-D -> but positions: E(1) G(2) G(3) E(4) D(5) -> but we need N at position4? So EGGED doesn't have N. We must have N at position4.

So the third character must be ... and fourth must be N.

List: E at1, N at4: E _ _ N _
Possible words: 
- EKING: E-K-I-N-G -> positions: E(1),K(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). But EKING is a valid word? Eking (meaning to make a living with difficulty). And it has I and K. But note: our feedback said A is absent, but I is new.

But EKING uses I? That's fine.

Alternatively, E at2: _ E _ N _
Examples: 
- BENCH -> B-E-N-C-H? But C is eliminated -> invalid because of C.
- Denim -> D-E-N-I-M -> positions: D(1),E(2),N(4)? Wait no: DENIM: D(1),E(2),N(3),I(4),M(5) -> but we need N at position4? So positions: letter1: D, letter2: E, letter3: N? But we know that the feedback from CRANE showed N at position4 (the fourth letter) was correct. So the secret word has N as the fourth letter? Therefore, in DENIM, N is at position3? Not at position4. So DENIM doesn't have N at 4.

So we must have N at position4.

Therefore, for E at position2: 
Word structure: [L1] E [L3] N [L5]
Examples: 
- T E N T N? No, that would be T-E-N-T-N? Invalid.
- How about: GREEN? Would be G-R-E-E-N? G(1),R(2) -> but R is eliminated? We cannot use R. And positions: E at position3? Then E at position4? But N is at5? We need N at4. So GREEN: G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), N(5) -> then E is at position3 and4? But N is at position5? Not 4.

We need N at position4: so L1, L2, L3, N, L5.

If E at position2, then [L1] E [L3] N [L5]

Examples:
- BENCH: illegal due to C.
- DENIM: N at position3, so not at4 -> invalid structure.
- Try: P E N N Y -> P-E-N-N-Y -> but N is at3 and4, so we have N at position4? Yes: position4 is the second N? P-E-N-N-Y: indices: 1:P, 2:E, 3:N, 4:N, 5:Y. So position4 is N? Correct. But PENNY has two N's? Which is acceptable? Also, has E at position2. And avoids C,R,A? Yes.

So PENNY: P-E-N-N-Y -> letter5 is Y? And position2 is E.

But we have N at position4? Yes: the fourth letter is N. And E at 2: but is the second letter? Then the word PENNY would have E at position2 and that is valid? But in the secret word, E could be at position2? We don't know.

But PENNY has two N's? We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters? It could.

Alternatively, other words: 
- HEIST: H-E-I-S-T -> but S at4? Then no N at4? H-E-I-S-T: position1:H,2:E,3:I,4:S,5:T -> S at4, not N. So no.

- How about BEING? B-E-I-N-G -> positions: B(1),E(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). Perfect! And BEING avoids C,R,A and has E at 2 and N at4.

BEING is a valid word.

E at position3: _ _ E N _

Examples: 
- QUEEN: Q-U-E-E-N -> positions: Q(1),U(2),E(3),E(4),N(5) -> then E at3 and4? But N at5? Not at4. So not.
- GREEN: G(1),R(2),E(3),E(4),N(5) -> E at3 and4? N at5? No.
- SCENE: S-C-E-N-E -> but C is eliminated? And C is present? But we know C is not in secret word, so invalid.
- Try: STONE -> S-T-O-N-E -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),N(4),E(5). Then E is at5? But our feedback said E is not at5? So STONE has E at5? So if we choose STONE, then we are putting E at5 which we know is wrong? Therefore, in this guess, we would not set E at5? Because we know it shouldn't be?

But our goal is to test E at different positions? We know E is not at5? So we avoid putting E at5? Yes?

So for our second guess, we have several options:
1. E at position1: e.g., EKING
2. E at position2: e.g., BEING
3. E at position3: e.g., ... let's find a word. What about: OLDEN? O-L-D-E-N -> O(1),L(2),D(3),E(4),N(5) -> E at4? But we need N at4? So OLDEN has N at5? No. Then SHIRE? S-H-I-R-E -> R eliminated? and N missing.

Another example for E at3: A R E N L? Invalid. 

Try: OPIUM? But no E? 

Better: using common letters.

What about: TEPID? T-E-P-I-D -> positions: T(1),E(2),P(3),I(4),D(5) -> no N at4? Then no.

Or: MOVED? But no N.

Alternatively: UNSET? U-N-S-E-T -> U(1),N(2),S(3),E(4),T(5) -> N at2 not4.

So harder to find with E at3? How about: AWAKE? But has A? Eliminated. 

Another: CHILL? C eliminated.

Perhaps: THEFT? T-H-E-F-T -> T(1),H(2),E(3),F(4),T(5) -> F at4? Not N.

CHILI? C and I.

It might be easier to find with E at1 or E at2.

I think BEING is a good candidate: B,E,I,N,G. New letters: B, I, G.

Alternatively, EKING: E,K,I,N,G.

Note: we are not sure if E is at1 or 2? But by guessing BEING, if E is at position2? We can get feedback? Similarly, EKING tests E at1.

Since we have limited guesses, we might pick BEING because it also introduces B,I,G.

We could also consider PENNY? But PENNY has P,E,N,Y? With Y? And double N? That might be less common? But BEING is more common.

Another word: DEIGN? D-E-I-G-N -> D(1),E(2),I(3),G(4),N(5) -> N at5, not at4? So invalid.

Or: FEIGN? F-E-I-G-N -> F(1),E(2),I(3),G(4),N(5) -> again N at5.

So PENNY is one option: P,E,N,N,Y? Not ideal because repeated N? But acceptable? Or BEING.

Perhaps: HELLO? But E at2? Then O at4? No N at4.

How about MELON? M-E-L-O-N -> M(1),E(2),L(3),O(4),N(5) -> N at5? Not at4.

LEMON? L-E-M-O-N -> L(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5) -> same as above.

So BEING is a valid word: 
- B at1, E at2, I at3, N at4, G at5.

We know E is not at5? And we avoid putting E at5? So BEING has E at2? Good.

We also don't know about position5: currently G.

But we can get information about B, I, G.

So let's choose BEING.

But wait: we must ensure that E is included? Because we know E is in the word? And to verify? Actually, if we don't include E, we wouldn't test it? But we know E is present? So we think BEING is a solid guess? Because it places E at position2? So we can test if E is at2? If it isn't, then we get dash or something? Actually, if E is at1 or3? Then we would get dash for E at2? That would be helpful.

Alternatively, we could choose a word with E at a different position? But BEING also tests B, I, G and confirms E? 

Yes.

Other option: since N is fixed, we might try a word that has E and also uses more common letters? 

But BEING: B, E, I, N, G? This introduces B, I, G. 

Another option: RESET? But R is eliminated? And S at4? Not N.

Or: QUITE? Q-U-I-T-E -> too many vowels? and no N at4.

We'll go with BEING.

So my second guess: BEING

Response format: <guess>BEING</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":

- C, R, and A are not in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- N is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (indicated by ""✓"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (indicated by ""-"").

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _
- E must appear in the word but not in position 5. Given that position 4 is occupied by N, E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The word cannot contain C, R, or A.

For the next guess:
- We need a 5-letter word that includes E in position 1, 2, or 3, avoids C/R/A, and leaves position 4 as N.
- To maximize information, new letters should be introduced to test other common consonants and vowels.
- ""BEING"" is a valid word that fits:
  - B (new) at position 1
  - E (known in word) at position 2 to test if correct position
  - I (new vowel) at position 3
  - N (fixed) at position 4
  - G (new consonant) at position 5
- This guess tests E's position and covers new letters without reusing eliminated letters.",Guess 2: BEING -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,EKING,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have to make the first guess. Since there's no feedback yet, we want to choose a word that maximizes information gain. Typically, words with common letters and no repeating letters are good for first guesses.

Common starting words in Wordle include:
- CRANE
- SLATE
- REAST
- TRACE
- SALET

But note: We are limited to 5-letter words. I recall that ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also good: S, L, A, T, E.

Let's pick ""SLATE"". It has three distinct vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (S, L, T). But wait, it has two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

Another candidate: ""ROATE"" (which is a valid word meaning the accumulated earnings that have not been paid as dividends) but might be less known.

I think ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are solid.

I'll go with ""CRANE"" because I'm more familiar with it.

So, my first guess: CRANE

Response format:
<guess>CRANE</guess>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess: CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)
Interpretation:
- C (x): C is not in the secret word.
- R (x): R is not in the secret word.
- A (x): A is not in the secret word.
- N (✓): N is in the secret word and is in the correct position (so the fourth letter is N).
- E (-): E is in the secret word but not in the fifth position. Therefore, E must be in one of the first three positions? Wait, but note: the secret word has 5 letters.

Important: The feedback indicates:
- The fourth letter is N (position 4).
- E is in the word but not in the last position (since we guessed it at position 5 and it's wrong). Therefore, E must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or possibly 4? But position 4 is N, so E is not at position 4. Therefore, E is in position 1, 2, or 3? Or wait, position 5? But we are told it's in the wrong position for 5. Since we are told it's present but not at 5, then it must be in 1,2,3, or 4? But position 4 is taken by N? Actually, the feedback says N is at position 4 (correct), so E cannot be at position 4. Therefore, E must be at position 1,2,3, or possibly 5? But we got a dash at 5 meaning it's not at 5. So E must be in one of the positions 1 to 4, but not 4? Actually, position 4 is occupied by N, so E must be at position 1,2, or 3.

Additionally, we know that C, R, A are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Has N as the fourth letter (position 4).
- Contains the letter E somewhere, but not at position 5 (and not at position 4 because that's N).
- Does not contain C, R, or A.
- The word is 5 letters: _ _ _ N _

We need to pick a new guess that:
- Is a valid 5-letter word.
- Includes E (since we know E is in the word) but E cannot be at position 5 (and we also know it's not at position 4? Not necessarily, but we know position 4 is N). Also, from the feedback, E is not at position 5, so in our next guess we might want to put E at position 1, 2, or 3 to check.
- Does not contain C, R, or A.

Since we only have 5 tries left, we need to maximize information. We know N is fixed at position 4. We know E must be somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (or possibly 5? but we were told position 5 was wrong, so not 5? Actually: the dash at E means it is in the word but not at position 5. So E must be in 1-4 but position 4 is N so E must be in 1,2, or 3).

Therefore, the word structure: [Letter1] [Letter2] [Letter3] N [Letter5]

And E is one of Letter1, Letter2, or Letter3.

Also, we have eliminated C, R, A.

Let us think of common words that fit this pattern.

We should also try to use new letters to get more information. We have used C, R, A, N, E. Now known: N and E are in, C,R,A out.

So new guess should include E in positions 1,2, or 3, and avoid C,R,A. Also, we can try to include other common consonants or vowels.

Possible strategies: Try to place E in different positions? We don't know where E is, so we can test one of the positions.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has E and other common letters we haven't tried yet, while keeping N at position 4? But wait, we are not forced to put N at position 4? Actually, we know N is fixed at position 4, so we must keep that? Because it's correct. So our next guess must have N at position 4? Yes.

So guess structure: _ _ _ N _

And we know E is in the word but not at the last position, so we must include E either at position 1,2, or 3? Actually, we don't have to include E in this guess? But why wouldn't we? We know E is present, so we can use it to get positional information.

Also, we must not re-use C,R,A.

So we need to fill: [Letter1] [Letter2] [Letter3] N [Letter5]

And we know E must be one of L1, L2, L3? Actually, Letter5 might be E? But wait, the feedback from the first guess said that E in position5 is wrong, so E cannot be at position5? Therefore, E must be in L1, L2, or L3.

Therefore, our guess must have E at either position1, 2, or 3.

We also want to test new letters.

Common letters left: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but avoiding C,R,A). And we haven't used O,U,I etc.

But note: we have limited knowledge, so testing multiple vowels or common consonants might be good.

Let me think of words that fit: _ _ _ N E? But wait, E cannot be at position5? So we cannot have E at the end. Therefore, the fifth letter is not E, so we need another letter.

Possible words: 
- If E is at position1: E _ _ N _
- E.g., E? The word must have E at 1 and N at 4, and then other letters. Examples: ELFIN? But check: E L F I N -> positions: E at1, N at5? But we need N at4? N at index 4? Wait, if E at1 and N at4, then word like E? ? ? N ? 

Examples: 
- E at position1: E X I N L? Not a word. How about E V E N T? Too long? 5 letters only. So E V E N T is 5? E(1)V(2)E(3)N(4)T(5). But E is at position1 and 3? We have feedback that E is in the word at least once, but it might be repeated? However, we have not ruled out duplicates.

But we must avoid using C,R,A.

Potential words with E at 1 and N at 4:
- ELAND: E-L-A-N-D -> but A is in ELAND? But we know A is not in the word. So not valid? We cannot use A. So ELAND invalid.

How about words like: 
- EGENT? E-G-E-N-T? But E at 1 and 3? And N at 4? So E G E N T -> but G and T are new. However, ELAND used A which is forbidden.

What about EGGED? E-G-G-E-D -> but positions: E(1) G(2) G(3) E(4) D(5) -> but we need N at position4? So EGGED doesn't have N. We must have N at position4.

So the third character must be ... and fourth must be N.

List: E at1, N at4: E _ _ N _
Possible words: 
- EKING: E-K-I-N-G -> positions: E(1),K(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). But EKING is a valid word? Eking (meaning to make a living with difficulty). And it has I and K. But note: our feedback said A is absent, but I is new.

But EKING uses I? That's fine.

Alternatively, E at2: _ E _ N _
Examples: 
- BENCH -> B-E-N-C-H? But C is eliminated -> invalid because of C.
- Denim -> D-E-N-I-M -> positions: D(1),E(2),N(4)? Wait no: DENIM: D(1),E(2),N(3),I(4),M(5) -> but we need N at position4? So positions: letter1: D, letter2: E, letter3: N? But we know that the feedback from CRANE showed N at position4 (the fourth letter) was correct. So the secret word has N as the fourth letter? Therefore, in DENIM, N is at position3? Not at position4. So DENIM doesn't have N at 4.

So we must have N at position4.

Therefore, for E at position2: 
Word structure: [L1] E [L3] N [L5]
Examples: 
- T E N T N? No, that would be T-E-N-T-N? Invalid.
- How about: GREEN? Would be G-R-E-E-N? G(1),R(2) -> but R is eliminated? We cannot use R. And positions: E at position3? Then E at position4? But N is at5? We need N at4. So GREEN: G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), N(5) -> then E is at position3 and4? But N is at position5? Not 4.

We need N at position4: so L1, L2, L3, N, L5.

If E at position2, then [L1] E [L3] N [L5]

Examples:
- BENCH: illegal due to C.
- DENIM: N at position3, so not at4 -> invalid structure.
- Try: P E N N Y -> P-E-N-N-Y -> but N is at3 and4, so we have N at position4? Yes: position4 is the second N? P-E-N-N-Y: indices: 1:P, 2:E, 3:N, 4:N, 5:Y. So position4 is N? Correct. But PENNY has two N's? Which is acceptable? Also, has E at position2. And avoids C,R,A? Yes.

So PENNY: P-E-N-N-Y -> letter5 is Y? And position2 is E.

But we have N at position4? Yes: the fourth letter is N. And E at 2: but is the second letter? Then the word PENNY would have E at position2 and that is valid? But in the secret word, E could be at position2? We don't know.

But PENNY has two N's? We don't know if the secret word has repeated letters? It could.

Alternatively, other words: 
- HEIST: H-E-I-S-T -> but S at4? Then no N at4? H-E-I-S-T: position1:H,2:E,3:I,4:S,5:T -> S at4, not N. So no.

- How about BEING? B-E-I-N-G -> positions: B(1),E(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). Perfect! And BEING avoids C,R,A and has E at 2 and N at4.

BEING is a valid word.

E at position3: _ _ E N _

Examples: 
- QUEEN: Q-U-E-E-N -> positions: Q(1),U(2),E(3),E(4),N(5) -> then E at3 and4? But N at5? Not at4. So not.
- GREEN: G(1),R(2),E(3),E(4),N(5) -> E at3 and4? N at5? No.
- SCENE: S-C-E-N-E -> but C is eliminated? And C is present? But we know C is not in secret word, so invalid.
- Try: STONE -> S-T-O-N-E -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),N(4),E(5). Then E is at5? But our feedback said E is not at5? So STONE has E at5? So if we choose STONE, then we are putting E at5 which we know is wrong? Therefore, in this guess, we would not set E at5? Because we know it shouldn't be?

But our goal is to test E at different positions? We know E is not at5? So we avoid putting E at5? Yes?

So for our second guess, we have several options:
1. E at position1: e.g., EKING
2. E at position2: e.g., BEING
3. E at position3: e.g., ... let's find a word. What about: OLDEN? O-L-D-E-N -> O(1),L(2),D(3),E(4),N(5) -> E at4? But we need N at4? So OLDEN has N at5? No. Then SHIRE? S-H-I-R-E -> R eliminated? and N missing.

Another example for E at3: A R E N L? Invalid. 

Try: OPIUM? But no E? 

Better: using common letters.

What about: TEPID? T-E-P-I-D -> positions: T(1),E(2),P(3),I(4),D(5) -> no N at4? Then no.

Or: MOVED? But no N.

Alternatively: UNSET? U-N-S-E-T -> U(1),N(2),S(3),E(4),T(5) -> N at2 not4.

So harder to find with E at3? How about: AWAKE? But has A? Eliminated. 

Another: CHILL? C eliminated.

Perhaps: THEFT? T-H-E-F-T -> T(1),H(2),E(3),F(4),T(5) -> F at4? Not N.

CHILI? C and I.

It might be easier to find with E at1 or E at2.

I think BEING is a good candidate: B,E,I,N,G. New letters: B, I, G.

Alternatively, EKING: E,K,I,N,G.

Note: we are not sure if E is at1 or 2? But by guessing BEING, if E is at position2? We can get feedback? Similarly, EKING tests E at1.

Since we have limited guesses, we might pick BEING because it also introduces B,I,G.

We could also consider PENNY? But PENNY has P,E,N,Y? With Y? And double N? That might be less common? But BEING is more common.

Another word: DEIGN? D-E-I-G-N -> D(1),E(2),I(3),G(4),N(5) -> N at5, not at4? So invalid.

Or: FEIGN? F-E-I-G-N -> F(1),E(2),I(3),G(4),N(5) -> again N at5.

So PENNY is one option: P,E,N,N,Y? Not ideal because repeated N? But acceptable? Or BEING.

Perhaps: HELLO? But E at2? Then O at4? No N at4.

How about MELON? M-E-L-O-N -> M(1),E(2),L(3),O(4),N(5) -> N at5? Not at4.

LEMON? L-E-M-O-N -> L(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5) -> same as above.

So BEING is a valid word: 
- B at1, E at2, I at3, N at4, G at5.

We know E is not at5? And we avoid putting E at5? So BEING has E at2? Good.

We also don't know about position5: currently G.

But we can get information about B, I, G.

So let's choose BEING.

But wait: we must ensure that E is included? Because we know E is in the word? And to verify? Actually, if we don't include E, we wouldn't test it? But we know E is present? So we think BEING is a solid guess? Because it places E at position2? So we can test if E is at2? If it isn't, then we get dash or something? Actually, if E is at1 or3? Then we would get dash for E at2? That would be helpful.

Alternatively, we could choose a word with E at a different position? But BEING also tests B, I, G and confirms E? 

Yes.

Other option: since N is fixed, we might try a word that has E and also uses more common letters? 

But BEING: B, E, I, N, G? This introduces B, I, G. 

Another option: RESET? But R is eliminated? And S at4? Not N.

Or: QUITE? Q-U-I-T-E -> too many vowels? and no N at4.

We'll go with BEING.

So my second guess: BEING

Response format: <guess>BEING</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":

- C, R, and A are not in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").
- N is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (indicated by ""✓"").
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (indicated by ""-"").

From this, we know:
- The secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _
- E must appear in the word but not in position 5. Given that position 4 is occupied by N, E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- The word cannot contain C, R, or A.

For the next guess:
- We need a 5-letter word that includes E in position 1, 2, or 3, avoids C/R/A, and leaves position 4 as N.
- To maximize information, new letters should be introduced to test other common consonants and vowels.
- ""BEING"" is a valid word that fits:
  - B (new) at position 1
  - E (known in word) at position 2 to test if correct position
  - I (new vowel) at position 3
  - N (fixed) at position 4
  - G (new consonant) at position 5
- This guess tests E's position and covers new letters without reusing eliminated letters.

Therefore, E must be in one of the first three positions? Wait, but note: the secret word has 5 letters.\n\nImportant: The feedback indicates:\n- The fourth letter is N (position 4).\n- E is in the word but not in the last position (since we guessed it at position 5 and it\'s wrong). Therefore, E must appear in positions 1, 2, 3, or possibly 4? But position 4 is N, so E is not at position 4. Therefore, E is in position 1, 2, or 3? Or wait, position 5? But we are told it\'s in the wrong position for 5. Since we are told it\'s present but not at 5, then it must be in 1,2,3, or 4? But position 4 is taken by N? Actually, the feedback says N is at position 4 (correct), so E cannot be at position 4. Therefore, E must be at position 1,2,3, or possibly 5? But we got a dash at 5 meaning it\'s not at 5. So E must be in one of the positions 1 to 4, but not 4? Actually, position 4 is occupied by N, so E must be at position 1,2, or 3.\n\nAdditionally, we know that C, R, A are not in the word at all.\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Has N as the fourth letter (position 4).\n- Contains the letter E somewhere, but not at position 5 (and not at position 4 because that\'s N).\n- Does not contain C, R, or A.\n- The word is 5 letters: _ _ _ N _\n\nWe need to pick a new guess that:\n- Is a valid 5-letter word.\n- Includes E (since we know E is in the word) but E cannot be at position 5 (and we also know it\'s not at position 4? Not necessarily, but we know position 4 is N). Also, from the feedback, E is not at position 5, so in our next guess we might want to put E at position 1, 2, or 3 to check.\n- Does not contain C, R, or A.\n\nSince we only have 5 tries left, we need to maximize information. We know N is fixed at position 4. We know E must be somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (or possibly 5? but we were told position 5 was wrong, so not 5? Actually: the dash at E means it is in the word but not at position 5. So E must be in 1-4 but position 4 is N so E must be in 1,2, or 3).\n\nTherefore, the word structure: [Letter1] [Letter2] [Letter3] N [Letter5]\n\nAnd E is one of Letter1, Letter2, or Letter3.\n\nAlso, we have eliminated C, R, A.\n\nLet us think of common words that fit this pattern.\n\nWe should also try to use new letters to get more information. We have used C, R, A, N, E. Now known: N and E are in, C,R,A out.\n\nSo new guess should include E in positions 1,2, or 3, and avoid C,R,A. Also, we can try to include other common consonants or vowels.\n\nPossible strategies: Try to place E in different positions? We don\'t know where E is, so we can test one of the positions.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that has E and other common letters we haven\'t tried yet, while keeping N at position 4? But wait, we are not forced to put N at position 4? Actually, we know N is fixed at position 4, so we must keep that? Because it\'s correct. So our next guess must have N at position 4? Yes.\n\nSo guess structure: _ _ _ N _\n\nAnd we know E is in the word but not at the last position, so we must include E either at position 1,2, or 3? Actually, we don\'t have to include E in this guess? But why wouldn\'t we? We know E is present, so we can use it to get positional information.\n\nAlso, we must not re-use C,R,A.\n\nSo we need to fill: [Letter1] [Letter2] [Letter3] N [Letter5]\n\nAnd we know E must be one of L1, L2, L3? Actually, Letter5 might be E? But wait, the feedback from the first guess said that E in position5 is wrong, so E cannot be at position5? Therefore, E must be in L1, L2, or L3.\n\nTherefore, our guess must have E at either position1, 2, or 3.\n\nWe also want to test new letters.\n\nCommon letters left: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (but avoiding C,R,A). And we haven\'t used O,U,I etc.\n\nBut note: we have limited knowledge, so testing multiple vowels or common consonants might be good.\n\nLet me think of words that fit: _ _ _ N E? But wait, E cannot be at position5? So we cannot have E at the end. Therefore, the fifth letter is not E, so we need another letter.\n\nPossible words: \n- If E is at position1: E _ _ N _\n- E.g., E? The word must have E at 1 and N at 4, and then other letters. Examples: ELFIN? But check: E L F I N -> positions: E at1, N at5? But we need N at4? N at index 4? Wait, if E at1 and N at4, then word like E? ? ? N ? \n\nExamples: \n- E at position1: E X I N L? Not a word. How about E V E N T? Too long? 5 letters only. So E V E N T is 5? E(1)V(2)E(3)N(4)T(5). But E is at position1 and 3? We have feedback that E is in the word at least once, but it might be repeated? However, we have not ruled out duplicates.\n\nBut we must avoid using C,R,A.\n\nPotential words with E at 1 and N at 4:\n- ELAND: E-L-A-N-D -> but A is in ELAND? But we know A is not in the word. So not valid? We cannot use A. So ELAND invalid.\n\nHow about words like: \n- EGENT? E-G-E-N-T? But E at 1 and 3? And N at 4? So E G E N T -> but G and T are new. However, ELAND used A which is forbidden.\n\nWhat about EGGED? E-G-G-E-D -> but positions: E(1) G(2) G(3) E(4) D(5) -> but we need N at position4? So EGGED doesn\'t have N. We must have N at position4.\n\nSo the third character must be ... and fourth must be N.\n\nList: E at1, N at4: E _ _ N _\nPossible words: \n- EKING: E-K-I-N-G -> positions: E(1),K(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). But EKING is a valid word? Eking (meaning to make a living with difficulty). And it has I and K. But note: our feedback said A is absent, but I is new.\n\nBut EKING uses I? That\'s fine.\n\nAlternatively, E at2: _ E _ N _\nExamples: \n- BENCH -> B-E-N-C-H? But C is eliminated -> invalid because of C.\n- Denim -> D-E-N-I-M -> positions: D(1),E(2),N(4)? Wait no: DENIM: D(1),E(2),N(3),I(4),M(5) -> but we need N at position4? So positions: letter1: D, letter2: E, letter3: N? But we know that the feedback from CRANE showed N at position4 (the fourth letter) was correct. So the secret word has N as the fourth letter? Therefore, in DENIM, N is at position3? Not at position4. So DENIM doesn\'t have N at 4.\n\nSo we must have N at position4.\n\nTherefore, for E at position2: \nWord structure: [L1] E [L3] N [L5]\nExamples: \n- T E N T N? No, that would be T-E-N-T-N? Invalid.\n- How about: GREEN? Would be G-R-E-E-N? G(1),R(2) -> but R is eliminated? We cannot use R. And positions: E at position3? Then E at position4? But N is at5? We need N at4. So GREEN: G(1), R(2), E(3), E(4), N(5) -> then E is at position3 and4? But N is at position5? Not 4.\n\nWe need N at position4: so L1, L2, L3, N, L5.\n\nIf E at position2, then [L1] E [L3] N [L5]\n\nExamples:\n- BENCH: illegal due to C.\n- DENIM: N at position3, so not at4 -> invalid structure.\n- Try: P E N N Y -> P-E-N-N-Y -> but N is at3 and4, so we have N at position4? Yes: position4 is the second N? P-E-N-N-Y: indices: 1:P, 2:E, 3:N, 4:N, 5:Y. So position4 is N? Correct. But PENNY has two N\'s? Which is acceptable? Also, has E at position2. And avoids C,R,A? Yes.\n\nSo PENNY: P-E-N-N-Y -> letter5 is Y? And position2 is E.\n\nBut we have N at position4? Yes: the fourth letter is N. And E at 2: but is the second letter? Then the word PENNY would have E at position2 and that is valid? But in the secret word, E could be at position2? We don\'t know.\n\nBut PENNY has two N\'s? We don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters? It could.\n\nAlternatively, other words: \n- HEIST: H-E-I-S-T -> but S at4? Then no N at4? H-E-I-S-T: position1:H,2:E,3:I,4:S,5:T -> S at4, not N. So no.\n\n- How about BEING? B-E-I-N-G -> positions: B(1),E(2),I(3),N(4),G(5). Perfect! And BEING avoids C,R,A and has E at 2 and N at4.\n\nBEING is a valid word.\n\nE at position3: _ _ E N _\n\nExamples: \n- QUEEN: Q-U-E-E-N -> positions: Q(1),U(2),E(3),E(4),N(5) -> then E at3 and4? But N at5? Not at4. So not.\n- GREEN: G(1),R(2),E(3),E(4),N(5) -> E at3 and4? N at5? No.\n- SCENE: S-C-E-N-E -> but C is eliminated? And C is present? But we know C is not in secret word, so invalid.\n- Try: STONE -> S-T-O-N-E -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),N(4),E(5). Then E is at5? But our feedback said E is not at5? So STONE has E at5? So if we choose STONE, then we are putting E at5 which we know is wrong? Therefore, in this guess, we would not set E at5? Because we know it shouldn\'t be?\n\nBut our goal is to test E at different positions? We know E is not at5? So we avoid putting E at5? Yes?\n\nSo for our second guess, we have several options:\n1. E at position1: e.g., EKING\n2. E at position2: e.g., BEING\n3. E at position3: e.g., ... let\'s find a word. What about: OLDEN? O-L-D-E-N -> O(1),L(2),D(3),E(4),N(5) -> E at4? But we need N at4? So OLDEN has N at5? No. Then SHIRE? S-H-I-R-E -> R eliminated? and N missing.\n\nAnother example for E at3: A R E N L? Invalid. \n\nTry: OPIUM? But no E? \n\nBetter: using common letters.\n\nWhat about: TEPID? T-E-P-I-D -> positions: T(1),E(2),P(3),I(4),D(5) -> no N at4? Then no.\n\nOr: MOVED? But no N.\n\nAlternatively: UNSET? U-N-S-E-T -> U(1),N(2),S(3),E(4),T(5) -> N at2 not4.\n\nSo harder to find with E at3? How about: AWAKE? But has A? Eliminated. \n\nAnother: CHILL? C eliminated.\n\nPerhaps: THEFT? T-H-E-F-T -> T(1),H(2),E(3),F(4),T(5) -> F at4? Not N.\n\nCHILI? C and I.\n\nIt might be easier to find with E at1 or E at2.\n\nI think BEING is a good candidate: B,E,I,N,G. New letters: B, I, G.\n\nAlternatively, EKING: E,K,I,N,G.\n\nNote: we are not sure if E is at1 or 2? But by guessing BEING, if E is at position2? We can get feedback? Similarly, EKING tests E at1.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we might pick BEING because it also introduces B,I,G.\n\nWe could also consider PENNY? But PENNY has P,E,N,Y? With Y? And double N? That might be less common? But BEING is more common.\n\nAnother word: DEIGN? D-E-I-G-N -> D(1),E(2),I(3),G(4),N(5) -> N at5, not at4? So invalid.\n\nOr: FEIGN? F-E-I-G-N -> F(1),E(2),I(3),G(4),N(5) -> again N at5.\n\nSo PENNY is one option: P,E,N,N,Y? Not ideal because repeated N? But acceptable? Or BEING.\n\nPerhaps: HELLO? But E at2? Then O at4? No N at4.\n\nHow about MELON? M-E-L-O-N -> M(1),E(2),L(3),O(4),N(5) -> N at5? Not at4.\n\nLEMON? L-E-M-O-N -> L(1),E(2),M(3),O(4),N(5) -> same as above.\n\nSo BEING is a valid word: \n- B at1, E at2, I at3, N at4, G at5.\n\nWe know E is not at5? And we avoid putting E at5? So BEING has E at2? Good.\n\nWe also don\'t know about position5: currently G.\n\nBut we can get information about B, I, G.\n\nSo let\'s choose BEING.\n\nBut wait: we must ensure that E is included? Because we know E is in the word? And to verify? Actually, if we don\'t include E, we wouldn\'t test it? But we know E is present? So we think BEING is a solid guess? Because it places E at position2? So we can test if E is at2? If it isn\'t, then we get dash or something? Actually, if E is at1 or3? Then we would get dash for E at2? That would be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word with E at a different position? But BEING also tests B, I, G and confirms E? \n\nYes.\n\nOther option: since N is fixed, we might try a word that has E and also uses more common letters? \n\nBut BEING: B, E, I, N, G? This introduces B, I, G. \n\nAnother option: RESET? But R is eliminated? And S at4? Not N.\n\nOr: QUITE? Q-U-I-T-E -> too many vowels? and no N at4.\n\nWe\'ll go with BEING.\n\nSo my second guess: BEING\n\nResponse format: <guess>BEING</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n\n- C, R, and A are not in the secret word (indicated by ""x"").\n- N is in the word and correctly placed at position 4 (indicated by ""✓"").\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (indicated by ""-"").\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word has the form: _ _ _ N _\n- E must appear in the word but not in position 5. Given that position 4 is occupied by N, E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- The word cannot contain C, R, or A.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- We need a 5-letter word that includes E in position 1, 2, or 3, avoids C/R/A, and leaves position 4 as N.\n- To maximize information, new letters should be introduced to test other common consonants and vowels.\n- ""BEING"" is a valid word that fits:\n  - B (new) at position 1\n  - E (known in word) at position 2 to test if correct position\n  - I (new vowel) at position 3\n  - N (fixed) at position 4\n  - G (new consonant) at position 5\n- This guess tests E\'s position and covers new letters without reusing eliminated letters.\n\n<guess>BEING</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(-)\nGuess 2: BEING -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(-) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We now have feedback from two guesses:
1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-) → so N is at position 4, E is in the word but not at position 5.
2. BEING: B(x), E(-), I(✓), N(✓), G(✓) → Interpretation:
   - B(x): B not in the word.
   - E(-): E is in the word but not at position 2 (since we guessed E at position 2 and got a dash).
   - I(✓): I is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.
   - N(✓): N confirmed again at position 4 (no change).
   - G(✓): G is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G
And E must be in the word, but not at position 5 (known from first guess) and not at position 2 (from this guess).

Also, we know E is not at position 3 because position 3 is I? And no duplicates? Or could there be duplicates? But we have no indication either way? So E could be at position 1? And we don't know about duplicates.

Moreover, we know C, R, A, B are not in the word.

So the word now has known positions: 3,4,5 are I, N, G? So structure: [Letter1] [Letter2] I N G

And E must appear? But not in positions 2 or 5? Position 5 is G? So E cannot be 5? And position 2 already? But we know E is in the word? And so far? Position1? Because positions 3,4,5 are fixed? Position 3 is I, which cannot be E? So E must be at position1 or in position2? But we got dash at position2? Meaning E is in word but not at position2? Therefore, E must be at position1? Because that's the only position left? Wait:

We have the word: [1] [2] I N G
- E cannot be at 2? And cannot be at 5? Also, positions 3 and 4 are taken by I and N? So E cannot be there? Then E must be at position1? Given that we know E is in the word? And we have exhausted other positions? So the secret word starts with E? And the word is E _ I N G

But we are missing the second letter? Also, we know E is at position1? So we expect E at position1? But let's confirm? We know E is present? And we have position1,2,3,4,5: only position1 is available? Because position2: we got dash? Meaning E is not at2? Positions 3,4,5: fixed? Then yes? E must be at position1? Therefore, the secret word is: E [Letter2] I N G

Then we need only to find the second letter? And we know words ending with ING? That start with E? And avoid C,R,A,B? And the second letter?

But E is not necessarily at position1? Because we haven't guessed it there? The feedback: we know E is present? The dash at position2 doesn't mean E might not be at position1? Actually, we know E is in the word? And we haven't tested position1? So it could be at position1? Or there could be duplication? But since position3,4,5 are fixed? The only possibility is that E is at position1? Else? What if the word has E twice? For example, like EXIST? But then position3 would be E? But no? Position3 is I? So duplicated? Possibly? But in E_ING? The E would have to be at position1? Because if E were at position2, we were told it's not? So at position1? Then why did we get E(-) at position2? That dash means E is present? But not at position2? Which implies the source E is elsewhere? Which must be position1? Then yes? We should conclude E is at position1? And the word is E _ I N G

Then what about the feedback for BEING? We got E(-) at position2? Meaning that E is in the word? But not at position2? And since position1,3,4,5: 3 and4,5 are fixed? Then yes? The letter at position1 must be E? So the word is E? I N G? Then second letter? We know it cannot be C,R,A,B? And must be a letter we haven't tried? Or possibly tried? 

So now our guess must be a word of the form E [X] I N G? But what words? Examples: e.g., ENDING? But D? And N is at position4? But ENDING: E(1),N(2),D(3),I(4)? No? Wait: we need positions: 1:E, 2:?, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G. So the word must have the pattern? E _ I N G? And not ENDING? Because ENDING doesn't have I at position3? 

Actually, ENDING is E-N-D-I-N-G? Which is 6 letters? Too long? Or E N D I N? Not? We need 5-letter words? So words that end with ING? That start with E? And have I at position3? So [E] [letter] I N G? Position3 is I? So the letters: 
- Position1: E 
- Position3: I 
- Position4: N 
- Position5: G 
and position2: ?

So the word is E X I N G? Only position2 is unknown? So the secret word is E?ING? 

And examples: What 5-letter words that start with E and end with ING? And have second letter? Then third is I? All such words? Because we have E _ I N G? 

Possible words: 
- EDGING? E D G I N G? Too long? 
- EASING? E A S I N G? But A is eliminated? 
- EXIST? But not ...? 
Wait, the pattern: E _ I N G? Only one word? I think ""EXIST"" is E-X-I-S-T? Not E?X?I?N?G? No.

Wait, we have fixed letters: 
Position1: E? 
Position3: I 
Position4: N 
Position5: G

So the word must be: E (letter2) I N G? 

The letter at position2 is the second character? And then the word: letter1=E, letter2=?, letter3=I, letter4=N, letter5=G? 

But that doesn't typically happen? Because ending with ING? But we have the third letter is I? So it's E?ING? Only if we think E?ING? But the ING? Positions: 
Position3: I? Position4: N? Position5: G? So yes? 

What are possible words? 
- We need words that have 5 letters: Start with E? Then letter? Then I? Then N? Then G? 

Examples: 
- EKING: E-K-I-N-G? Which matches? E(1),K(2,I(3)?N(4),G(5). Yes, EKING? 
- Is that the only word? There is also EDGING? But that has double G? E D G I N G? Why not? 
But EDGING? E-D-G-I-N-G? Too long? 6 letters. 
- EMING? Not a word.
- How about: EVEN? Not 5 letters.
- EYING: E-Y-I-N-G? But E(1),Y(2),I(3)?N(4),G(5). And EYING is a valid word? Meaning to watch something? 

So EYING: E-Y-I-N-G? And EKING: E-K-I-N-G? 

Could there be others: 
- EXING? Not a common word? 
- EBENG? Not a word.
So most likely EKING? As in the word from before? Or others?

But we have a second letter? So the secret word could be EKING? 

Now, we can guess EKING? Because it fits? And it will tell us the second letter? 

But note: we know K? Not yet? So we can guess EKING? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses common letters? But since we have three letters fixed? And only one unknown? We should guess? 

But let's see the remaining letters? We know no C,R,A,B? So for the second letter, possible candidates? From EKING: K? Or EYING: Y? 

But we don't know which? So we can guess EKING? 

Then our third guess: EKING? 

But let's see? We have confirmed E? Not exactly? We inferred E must be at position1? But what if there is a duplicate? For example? What if? Like INGOT? But at position3 is I? But that doesn't start with E? 

But in BEING? We got E(-)? And we have fixed positions 3,4,5? How about if the word has E at position1? But we haven't guessed position1? 

There could be another possibility: what if the word has two E's? For example, one at position1? And then we got dash for position2? But if E at position1? Then we need dashed? Because E at1? So if we guess EKING? And if the word is EKING? We get all correct? Else? 

But wait? There might be other words? Such as EYING? Or ELFIN? But ELFIN? E-L-F-I-N? Then positions: E(1), L(2), F(3), I(4), N(5)? But we need position3=I? And position4=N? Then ELFIN? Position3=F? Position4=I? Position5=N? Not matching? 

So the pattern is E _ I N G? 

Moreover, we know from CRANE? That E is not at5? And from BEING? That E is not at2? And positions 3,4,5 occupied? So E at1 must? Then yes? 

So secret word: E [X] I N G? Where X is some letter? Not C,R,A,B? 

Possible X: 
- K: EKING
- Y: EYING
- Possibly others? Not common? 

What about: E F I N G? Not a word? 
E G I N G? EGING? Not common? 
E H I N G? EHING? No?
E J I N G? EJING? No?
E M I N G? EMING? Not common?
E N I N G? ENING? Not typical? 
E P I N G? EPING? Perhaps ""ping"" is only, but not?
E Q I N G? 
E R I N G? ERING? But R is eliminated? 
E S I N G? ESING? Not common? 
E T I N G? ETING? Not recognized?
E U I N G? EUING? No?
E V I N G? EVING? No?
E W I N G? EWING? As a name? E W I N G? E(1) W(2) I(3) N(4) G(5)? But what about the word? ""Ewing"" is a surname? Possibly allowed? 

So valid words: 
1. EKING (playing the game to increase something? e.g., eking out a living)
2. EYING (watching slyly or with interest)
3. EWING (as a surname)

So we have three candidates? 

Now? We also got I(✓) at3? Which we already know? 

Now? For our third guess? We can guess one of these? Let's choose EKING? Because it introduces K? Which we haven't tried? If not? We can do EWING? But E? 

But note: we should avoid letters that are eliminated? Such as? R is eliminated? So EWING has W? 

So EKING: use K? 

Now? Guess: EKING? 

As such? We can then solve? 

But we only have four letters? Actually, positions 1,3,4,5 are fixed? And we have E? So if we guess EKING? Then:

If the secret word is EKING, we get all ✓? Else? If not? Then we know if K is wrong? 

But perhaps? For simplicity? 

Another thing? We want to maximize information? But with only one letter unknown? We can guess one of these? 

Alternatively? Is there a way to guess another word that include both? But unlikely? 

So let's guess EKING? 

Therefore? Third guess: EKING? 

In the format: <guess>EKING</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1 (CRANE)**:
   - C, R, A: Not in the word (x).
   - N: Correct and in position 4 (✓).
   - E: In the word but not in position 5 (-). Since position 4 is fixed as N, E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

2. **Guess 2 (BEING)**:
   - B: Not in the word (x).
   - E: In the word but not in position 2 (-). Combined with the first guess, E cannot be in position 2 or 5. As positions 3, 4, and 5 are now confirmed (see below), E must be in position 1.
   - I: Correct and in position 3 (✓).
   - N: Correct and in position 4 (✓).
   - G: Correct and in position 5 (✓).

### Key Deductions:
- The secret word has the structure: **[E?] [Letter2] [I] [N] [G]**.
- Position 3 is **I**, position 4 is **N**, and position 5 is **G** (all confirmed).
- Position 2 is unknown but cannot be **C, R, A, B** (eliminated).
- **E** must be in position 1 because:
  - It is in the word (confirmed by feedback).
  - It cannot be in position 2 (from BEING feedback).
  - It cannot be in position 5 (from CRANE feedback).
  - Positions 3 and 4 are occupied by I and N.
- Thus, the secret word starts with **E** and ends with **ING**, forming the pattern: **E _ I N G**.

### Next Guess Strategy:
- The unknown letter (position 2) must be tested. Possible valid English words fitting ""E _ ING"" include:
  - **EKING** (e.g., ""eking out a living"").
  - **EYING** (e.g., ""watching closely"").
  - **EWING** (a surname, less common).
- **EKING** is chosen because:
  - It introduces **K**, a common letter not yet tested.
  - It efficiently tests position 1 for **E** (expected to be ✓) and reveals the letter at position 2.
  - If **EKING** is incorrect, feedback on **K** will narrow down the word (e.g., if **K** is wrong, **EYING** or **EWING** become candidates).

<guess>EKING</guess>",EKING,"We now have feedback from two guesses:
1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(-) → so N is at position 4, E is in the word but not at position 5.
2. BEING: B(x), E(-), I(✓), N(✓), G(✓) → Interpretation:
   - B(x): B not in the word.
   - E(-): E is in the word but not at position 2 (since we guessed E at position 2 and got a dash).
   - I(✓): I is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.
   - N(✓): N confirmed again at position 4 (no change).
   - G(✓): G is in the word and correctly placed at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word must have:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G
And E must be in the word, but not at position 5 (known from first guess) and not at position 2 (from this guess).

Also, we know E is not at position 3 because position 3 is I? And no duplicates? Or could there be duplicates? But we have no indication either way? So E could be at position 1? And we don't know about duplicates.

Moreover, we know C, R, A, B are not in the word.

So the word now has known positions: 3,4,5 are I, N, G? So structure: [Letter1] [Letter2] I N G

And E must appear? But not in positions 2 or 5? Position 5 is G? So E cannot be 5? And position 2 already? But we know E is in the word? And so far? Position1? Because positions 3,4,5 are fixed? Position 3 is I, which cannot be E? So E must be at position1 or in position2? But we got dash at position2? Meaning E is in word but not at position2? Therefore, E must be at position1? Because that's the only position left? Wait:

We have the word: [1] [2] I N G
- E cannot be at 2? And cannot be at 5? Also, positions 3 and 4 are taken by I and N? So E cannot be there? Then E must be at position1? Given that we know E is in the word? And we have exhausted other positions? So the secret word starts with E? And the word is E _ I N G

But we are missing the second letter? Also, we know E is at position1? So we expect E at position1? But let's confirm? We know E is present? And we have position1,2,3,4,5: only position1 is available? Because position2: we got dash? Meaning E is not at2? Positions 3,4,5: fixed? Then yes? E must be at position1? Therefore, the secret word is: E [Letter2] I N G

Then we need only to find the second letter? And we know words ending with ING? That start with E? And avoid C,R,A,B? And the second letter?

But E is not necessarily at position1? Because we haven't guessed it there? The feedback: we know E is present? The dash at position2 doesn't mean E might not be at position1? Actually, we know E is in the word? And we haven't tested position1? So it could be at position1? Or there could be duplication? But since position3,4,5 are fixed? The only possibility is that E is at position1? Else? What if the word has E twice? For example, like EXIST? But then position3 would be E? But no? Position3 is I? So duplicated? Possibly? But in E_ING? The E would have to be at position1? Because if E were at position2, we were told it's not? So at position1? Then why did we get E(-) at position2? That dash means E is present? But not at position2? Which implies the source E is elsewhere? Which must be position1? Then yes? We should conclude E is at position1? And the word is E _ I N G

Then what about the feedback for BEING? We got E(-) at position2? Meaning that E is in the word? But not at position2? And since position1,3,4,5: 3 and4,5 are fixed? Then yes? The letter at position1 must be E? So the word is E? I N G? Then second letter? We know it cannot be C,R,A,B? And must be a letter we haven't tried? Or possibly tried? 

So now our guess must be a word of the form E [X] I N G? But what words? Examples: e.g., ENDING? But D? And N is at position4? But ENDING: E(1),N(2),D(3),I(4)? No? Wait: we need positions: 1:E, 2:?, 3:I, 4:N, 5:G. So the word must have the pattern? E _ I N G? And not ENDING? Because ENDING doesn't have I at position3? 

Actually, ENDING is E-N-D-I-N-G? Which is 6 letters? Too long? Or E N D I N? Not? We need 5-letter words? So words that end with ING? That start with E? And have I at position3? So [E] [letter] I N G? Position3 is I? So the letters: 
- Position1: E 
- Position3: I 
- Position4: N 
- Position5: G 
and position2: ?

So the word is E X I N G? Only position2 is unknown? So the secret word is E?ING? 

And examples: What 5-letter words that start with E and end with ING? And have second letter? Then third is I? All such words? Because we have E _ I N G? 

Possible words: 
- EDGING? E D G I N G? Too long? 
- EASING? E A S I N G? But A is eliminated? 
- EXIST? But not ...? 
Wait, the pattern: E _ I N G? Only one word? I think ""EXIST"" is E-X-I-S-T? Not E?X?I?N?G? No.

Wait, we have fixed letters: 
Position1: E? 
Position3: I 
Position4: N 
Position5: G

So the word must be: E (letter2) I N G? 

The letter at position2 is the second character? And then the word: letter1=E, letter2=?, letter3=I, letter4=N, letter5=G? 

But that doesn't typically happen? Because ending with ING? But we have the third letter is I? So it's E?ING? Only if we think E?ING? But the ING? Positions: 
Position3: I? Position4: N? Position5: G? So yes? 

What are possible words? 
- We need words that have 5 letters: Start with E? Then letter? Then I? Then N? Then G? 

Examples: 
- EKING: E-K-I-N-G? Which matches? E(1),K(2,I(3)?N(4),G(5). Yes, EKING? 
- Is that the only word? There is also EDGING? But that has double G? E D G I N G? Why not? 
But EDGING? E-D-G-I-N-G? Too long? 6 letters. 
- EMING? Not a word.
- How about: EVEN? Not 5 letters.
- EYING: E-Y-I-N-G? But E(1),Y(2),I(3)?N(4),G(5). And EYING is a valid word? Meaning to watch something? 

So EYING: E-Y-I-N-G? And EKING: E-K-I-N-G? 

Could there be others: 
- EXING? Not a common word? 
- EBENG? Not a word.
So most likely EKING? As in the word from before? Or others?

But we have a second letter? So the secret word could be EKING? 

Now, we can guess EKING? Because it fits? And it will tell us the second letter? 

But note: we know K? Not yet? So we can guess EKING? 

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses common letters? But since we have three letters fixed? And only one unknown? We should guess? 

But let's see the remaining letters? We know no C,R,A,B? So for the second letter, possible candidates? From EKING: K? Or EYING: Y? 

But we don't know which? So we can guess EKING? 

Then our third guess: EKING? 

But let's see? We have confirmed E? Not exactly? We inferred E must be at position1? But what if there is a duplicate? For example? What if? Like INGOT? But at position3 is I? But that doesn't start with E? 

But in BEING? We got E(-)? And we have fixed positions 3,4,5? How about if the word has E at position1? But we haven't guessed position1? 

There could be another possibility: what if the word has two E's? For example, one at position1? And then we got dash for position2? But if E at position1? Then we need dashed? Because E at1? So if we guess EKING? And if the word is EKING? We get all correct? Else? 

But wait? There might be other words? Such as EYING? Or ELFIN? But ELFIN? E-L-F-I-N? Then positions: E(1), L(2), F(3), I(4), N(5)? But we need position3=I? And position4=N? Then ELFIN? Position3=F? Position4=I? Position5=N? Not matching? 

So the pattern is E _ I N G? 

Moreover, we know from CRANE? That E is not at5? And from BEING? That E is not at2? And positions 3,4,5 occupied? So E at1 must? Then yes? 

So secret word: E [X] I N G? Where X is some letter? Not C,R,A,B? 

Possible X: 
- K: EKING
- Y: EYING
- Possibly others? Not common? 

What about: E F I N G? Not a word? 
E G I N G? EGING? Not common? 
E H I N G? EHING? No?
E J I N G? EJING? No?
E M I N G? EMING? Not common?
E N I N G? ENING? Not typical? 
E P I N G? EPING? Perhaps ""ping"" is only, but not?
E Q I N G? 
E R I N G? ERING? But R is eliminated? 
E S I N G? ESING? Not common? 
E T I N G? ETING? Not recognized?
E U I N G? EUING? No?
E V I N G? EVING? No?
E W I N G? EWING? As a name? E W I N G? E(1) W(2) I(3) N(4) G(5)? But what about the word? ""Ewing"" is a surname? Possibly allowed? 

So valid words: 
1. EKING (playing the game to increase something? e.g., eking out a living)
2. EYING (watching slyly or with interest)
3. EWING (as a surname)

So we have three candidates? 

Now? We also got I(✓) at3? Which we already know? 

Now? For our third guess? We can guess one of these? Let's choose EKING? Because it introduces K? Which we haven't tried? If not? We can do EWING? But E? 

But note: we should avoid letters that are eliminated? Such as? R is eliminated? So EWING has W? 

So EKING: use K? 

Now? Guess: EKING? 

As such? We can then solve? 

But we only have four letters? Actually, positions 1,3,4,5 are fixed? And we have E? So if we guess EKING? Then:

If the secret word is EKING, we get all ✓? Else? If not? Then we know if K is wrong? 

But perhaps? For simplicity? 

Another thing? We want to maximize information? But with only one letter unknown? We can guess one of these? 

Alternatively? Is there a way to guess another word that include both? But unlikely? 

So let's guess EKING?
