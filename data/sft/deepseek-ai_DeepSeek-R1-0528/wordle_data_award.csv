We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x -> not in the secret word
  R: - -> in the secret word but not in the first position
  A: ✓ -> correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is A)
  N: x -> not in the secret word
  E: x -> not in the secret word

So we know:
- The secret word has the letter R, but not in the second position (because R was in the first guess's second position and got '-', meaning it's in the word but misplaced).
- The second letter of the secret word is A (because A got a checkmark in the second position).
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.

Also, we know that the secret word does not contain C, N, E.

We must form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has the letter A in the second position (since it's confirmed there).
- Includes the letter R (because we know it's present) but not in the second position? Actually, in our guess, R was in the second position and it was misplaced. But note: the feedback for R is '-' meaning it is in the word, just not in that position. However, we don't know where it actually is. It could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Also, we know from the feedback that the secret word does not start with C (because C is absent), and the second letter is A. So the word has the form: _ A _ _ _

Now, our next guess should try to test more letters and also position the known letters appropriately.

Constraints:
- Avoid C, N, E.
- Must include R (somewhere except the second position? Actually, we can put R in any position except the second because we know it's not there? But wait: it's possible that R could appear multiple times? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates. Since the feedback doesn't show duplicates unless they are in the word multiple times, and we only have one R in ""crane"", we don't know. But typically, we assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

However, note the feedback: for ""crane"", we got one R marked as present (misplaced) and the others absent. So the secret word has at least one R.

We also know the secret word has the letter A in the second position and doesn't have C, N, E.

We should focus on using other common letters and try to place R appropriately.

Possible positions for R: since it cannot be in the second position, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But note: our guess ""crane"" had R in position 2, which was wrong. So R must be elsewhere, but we don't know which of the other positions.

For the next guess, we want to test R in a different position and also introduce new common letters.

Let me think of a word that:
- Second letter is A (fixed).
- Includes R (somewhere except second position).
- Does not contain C, N, E.
- Includes other common letters (like S, T, L, etc.)

Common letters: we can try S, T, L, I, O, P, etc.

Example words with second letter A and including R?

Let's try some possibilities:

- Start with R? e.g., words like: RAMPS, but we have to avoid N and E? Wait RAMPS: R (position1), A (position2), M (position3), P (position4), S (position5). But we don't know about M, P, S yet.

But note we can't use E, so avoid words ending in E? RAMPS avoids E.

Alternatively: PARTY: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). This uses common letters and includes R in third position.

But we don't know if P, T, Y are present.

Another: BARDS? B(1),A(2),R(3),D(4),S(5). Avoids the forbidden letters.

But we have two unknowns: we have R and also B, D, S.

However, we also want to cover more ground. Maybe choose a word with S, T, L? Since we know A and R are present, we can focus on other high-frequency letters.

Let me think: we have the second letter fixed as A. We need R somewhere else. And we avoid C, N, E.

Let's list some words that fit:
- SMART: S(1), A(2), M(3), R(4), T(5). This includes S, M, T and R. But note: we already tried C? But here S and T are new.

Also, note: we are going to get feedback on each letter again.

We could also try to see if the first letter is known? We don't have any hint about the first letter except it cannot be C (because C is absent). So any letter except C and also not N, E (but since the first letter cannot be C, N, E? Actually, we know the word doesn't have N and E anywhere). So the first letter cannot be C, N, E? It can be any other letter except C, N, E? Actually, we know the word doesn't contain C, N, E at all. So the first letter must be from the remaining 23 letters.

So all letters in the word must avoid C, N, E.

Therefore, SMART: letters S, A, M, R, T: none of which are C, N, E -> valid.

But we have R in the fourth position? Let me check the feedback: if we guess ""smart"", then:
- S: new letter -> could be anywhere?
- A: already in second position, so that should get a checkmark.
- R: in fourth position. We know from our previous feedback that R is in the word but not in the second position. We don't know about the fourth position.

We might get more information.

Alternatively, another word: TARES? But E is forbidden? Oh, TARES has E? So avoid since E is absent? Our feedback says E is not in the word, so TARES has E -> invalid.

Another word: PARTY: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). This avoids C, N, E.

Similarly, we could consider: BARKS: but K? and S? And B is new.

But let me go with SMART because it has common letters S, M, T and R, and we get A again in the second position which we know is fixed. And we test R in the fourth position.

But note: in our previous guess, R was in position 2 and was wrong. Now we put R in position 4. If R is actually in position 1, 3, or 5, then putting it in 4 will get a '-' or even a checkmark? We don't know.

However, we are trying to gather more information.

Another idea: we know the word has R and A in the second position. We can try a word with R in the first position to test that. Because if R is in first, then we might get a checkmark.

So words like: R A _ _ _ 
But no C, N, E.

Examples: RAPID? But we don't know if P, I, D are present? and we avoid E.

But note: we haven't used any of R, A in other positions? Actually, A is fixed in second.

So R A ? ? ? 

Possible words: RALLY? but L and Y and L? Letters: R, A, L, L -> but duplicates? We avoid duplicates? Actually, we can have duplicates? But we don't know. However, we have no information. But RALLY has two L's? We should avoid for now? Maybe choose without duplicates.

RANKS? but we know N is absent -> invalid because N is not in the word? RANKS contains N -> invalid.

RACER? contains C and E -> invalid.

So what about: RATIO? but contains T and I and O? and avoids C,N,E? Yes.

RATIO: R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). This tests R in position 1. And we test T, I, O.

But note: we already have A in the second position, so that part is safe.

So RATIO might be a good guess? Because it tests R at position one and adds common letters T, I, O.

Alternatively, we could try RABID? but B and I? and D? RABID: R(1),A(2),B(3),I(4),D(5). Avoids C,N,E.

But T and O might be more common? Actually, from letter frequency, E is most common but absent, then T, A, O, I, N (which is absent), S, etc. So T, O, I, S are good.

Therefore, RATIO is a good candidate.

Another: PARTS? P,A,R,T,S -> that's five distinct? P(1),A(2),R(3),T(4),S(5). This places R in the third position? And we avoid the second position? Yes.

But note: we haven't tested the positions close to the beginning? But RATIO tests position 1 for R.

I think testing R at position 1 is a good idea because if it's correct we get a checkmark, and if it's not, we know it must be in 3,4,5? Wait, we know it's not in position 2.

So let me choose RATIO.

But another consideration: we already know that the secret word does not contain C, N, E. And we are trying to find the position of R.

I'll go with RATIO because it uses R in first position and common letters T, I, O.

So my next guess is ""ratio"".

But wait: what about the feedback? In our previous guess, we had ""crane"" and got R as misplaced. Now when we put R in first position, we might get:
- If R is the first letter, then ✓
- If R is not in the first, but is present, then '-' (and then we know R is not in position1 either)
- Or worst, if R is not present? but it must be because we got a '-' in the first guess? So it must be present.

So we'll either get R with ✓ or with '-'.

Similarly for A: we know it's in the second position, so it should always be ✓.

So without loss, we can get feedback on the new letters.

Therefore, let's guess ""ratio"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is absent (x) → not in the secret word
- R is present but misplaced (-) → in the secret word, not in position 2
- A is correct and in position (✓) → second letter is A
- N is absent (x) → not in the secret word
- E is absent (x) → not in the secret word

Constraints derived:
- The secret word has the form _ A _ _ _
- Must contain R (somewhere except position 2)
- Cannot contain C, N, E
- Letters to prioritize for new information: common consonants (e.g., T, S, L, D) and vowels (e.g., I, O, U)

Strategy for this guess:
- Include R in a new position (position 1 is tested here to quickly validate/invalidate it as a starting letter)
- Retain A in position 2 (since it's confirmed)
- Avoid C, N, E entirely
- Introduce new high-frequency letters (T, I, O) to maximize feedback information
- Choose a word that fits: ""ratio"" meets these criteria (R in position 1, A in position 2, and testing T, I, O)

If R is in position 1, we may receive a ✓ for R, confirming its position. If R is misplaced again, we narrow its possible locations to positions 3–5. Feedback on T, I, and O will further reduce possibilities.

Also, we know that the secret word does not contain C, N, E.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x -> not in the secret word
  R: - -> in the secret word but not in the first position
  A: ✓ -> correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is A)
  N: x -> not in the secret word
  E: x -> not in the secret word

So we know:
- The secret word has the letter R, but not in the second position (because R was in the first guess's second position and got '-', meaning it's in the word but misplaced).
- The second letter of the secret word is A (because A got a checkmark in the second position).
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.

Also, we know that the secret word does not contain C, N, E.

We must form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has the letter A in the second position (since it's confirmed there).
- Includes the letter R (because we know it's present) but not in the second position? Actually, in our guess, R was in the second position and it was misplaced. But note: the feedback for R is '-' meaning it is in the word, just not in that position. However, we don't know where it actually is. It could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Also, we know from the feedback that the secret word does not start with C (because C is absent), and the second letter is A. So the word has the form: _ A _ _ _

Now, our next guess should try to test more letters and also position the known letters appropriately.

Constraints:
- Avoid C, N, E.
- Must include R (somewhere except the second position? Actually, we can put R in any position except the second because we know it's not there? But wait: it's possible that R could appear multiple times? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates. Since the feedback doesn't show duplicates unless they are in the word multiple times, and we only have one R in ""crane"", we don't know. But typically, we assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

However, note the feedback: for ""crane"", we got one R marked as present (misplaced) and the others absent. So the secret word has at least one R.

We also know the secret word has the letter A in the second position and doesn't have C, N, E.

We should focus on using other common letters and try to place R appropriately.

Possible positions for R: since it cannot be in the second position, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But note: our guess ""crane"" had R in position 2, which was wrong. So R must be elsewhere, but we don't know which of the other positions.

For the next guess, we want to test R in a different position and also introduce new common letters.

Let me think of a word that:
- Second letter is A (fixed).
- Includes R (somewhere except second position).
- Does not contain C, N, E.
- Includes other common letters (like S, T, L, etc.)

Common letters: we can try S, T, L, I, O, P, etc.

Example words with second letter A and including R?

Let's try some possibilities:

- Start with R? e.g., words like: RAMPS, but we have to avoid N and E? Wait RAMPS: R (position1), A (position2), M (position3), P (position4), S (position5). But we don't know about M, P, S yet.

But note we can't use E, so avoid words ending in E? RAMPS avoids E.

Alternatively: PARTY: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). This uses common letters and includes R in third position.

But we don't know if P, T, Y are present.

Another: BARDS? B(1),A(2),R(3),D(4),S(5). Avoids the forbidden letters.

But we have two unknowns: we have R and also B, D, S.

However, we also want to cover more ground. Maybe choose a word with S, T, L? Since we know A and R are present, we can focus on other high-frequency letters.

Let me think: we have the second letter fixed as A. We need R somewhere else. And we avoid C, N, E.

Let's list some words that fit:
- SMART: S(1), A(2), M(3), R(4), T(5). This includes S, M, T and R. But note: we already tried C? But here S and T are new.

Also, note: we are going to get feedback on each letter again.

We could also try to see if the first letter is known? We don't have any hint about the first letter except it cannot be C (because C is absent). So any letter except C and also not N, E (but since the first letter cannot be C, N, E? Actually, we know the word doesn't have N and E anywhere). So the first letter cannot be C, N, E? It can be any other letter except C, N, E? Actually, we know the word doesn't contain C, N, E at all. So the first letter must be from the remaining 23 letters.

So all letters in the word must avoid C, N, E.

Therefore, SMART: letters S, A, M, R, T: none of which are C, N, E -> valid.

But we have R in the fourth position? Let me check the feedback: if we guess ""smart"", then:
- S: new letter -> could be anywhere?
- A: already in second position, so that should get a checkmark.
- R: in fourth position. We know from our previous feedback that R is in the word but not in the second position. We don't know about the fourth position.

We might get more information.

Alternatively, another word: TARES? But E is forbidden? Oh, TARES has E? So avoid since E is absent? Our feedback says E is not in the word, so TARES has E -> invalid.

Another word: PARTY: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). This avoids C, N, E.

Similarly, we could consider: BARKS: but K? and S? And B is new.

But let me go with SMART because it has common letters S, M, T and R, and we get A again in the second position which we know is fixed. And we test R in the fourth position.

But note: in our previous guess, R was in position 2 and was wrong. Now we put R in position 4. If R is actually in position 1, 3, or 5, then putting it in 4 will get a '-' or even a checkmark? We don't know.

However, we are trying to gather more information.

Another idea: we know the word has R and A in the second position. We can try a word with R in the first position to test that. Because if R is in first, then we might get a checkmark.

So words like: R A _ _ _ 
But no C, N, E.

Examples: RAPID? But we don't know if P, I, D are present? and we avoid E.

But note: we haven't used any of R, A in other positions? Actually, A is fixed in second.

So R A ? ? ? 

Possible words: RALLY? but L and Y and L? Letters: R, A, L, L -> but duplicates? We avoid duplicates? Actually, we can have duplicates? But we don't know. However, we have no information. But RALLY has two L's? We should avoid for now? Maybe choose without duplicates.

RANKS? but we know N is absent -> invalid because N is not in the word? RANKS contains N -> invalid.

RACER? contains C and E -> invalid.

So what about: RATIO? but contains T and I and O? and avoids C,N,E? Yes.

RATIO: R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). This tests R in position 1. And we test T, I, O.

But note: we already have A in the second position, so that part is safe.

So RATIO might be a good guess? Because it tests R at position one and adds common letters T, I, O.

Alternatively, we could try RABID? but B and I? and D? RABID: R(1),A(2),B(3),I(4),D(5). Avoids C,N,E.

But T and O might be more common? Actually, from letter frequency, E is most common but absent, then T, A, O, I, N (which is absent), S, etc. So T, O, I, S are good.

Therefore, RATIO is a good candidate.

Another: PARTS? P,A,R,T,S -> that's five distinct? P(1),A(2),R(3),T(4),S(5). This places R in the third position? And we avoid the second position? Yes.

But note: we haven't tested the positions close to the beginning? But RATIO tests position 1 for R.

I think testing R at position 1 is a good idea because if it's correct we get a checkmark, and if it's not, we know it must be in 3,4,5? Wait, we know it's not in position 2.

So let me choose RATIO.

But another consideration: we already know that the secret word does not contain C, N, E. And we are trying to find the position of R.

I'll go with RATIO because it uses R in first position and common letters T, I, O.

So my next guess is ""ratio"".

But wait: what about the feedback? In our previous guess, we had ""crane"" and got R as misplaced. Now when we put R in first position, we might get:
- If R is the first letter, then ✓
- If R is not in the first, but is present, then '-' (and then we know R is not in position1 either)
- Or worst, if R is not present? but it must be because we got a '-' in the first guess? So it must be present.

So we'll either get R with ✓ or with '-'.

Similarly for A: we know it's in the second position, so it should always be ✓.

So without loss, we can get feedback on the new letters.

Therefore, let's guess ""ratio"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is absent (x) → not in the secret word
- R is present but misplaced (-) → in the secret word, not in position 2
- A is correct and in position (✓) → second letter is A
- N is absent (x) → not in the secret word
- E is absent (x) → not in the secret word

Constraints derived:
- The secret word has the form _ A _ _ _
- Must contain R (somewhere except position 2)
- Cannot contain C, N, E
- Letters to prioritize for new information: common consonants (e.g., T, S, L, D) and vowels (e.g., I, O, U)

Strategy for this guess:
- Include R in a new position (position 1 is tested here to quickly validate/invalidate it as a starting letter)
- Retain A in position 2 (since it's confirmed)
- Avoid C, N, E entirely
- Introduce new high-frequency letters (T, I, O) to maximize feedback information
- Choose a word that fits: ""ratio"" meets these criteria (R in position 1, A in position 2, and testing T, I, O)

If R is in position 1, we may receive a ✓ for R, confirming its position. If R is misplaced again, we narrow its possible locations to positions 3–5. Feedback on T, I, and O will further reduce possibilities.

We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the second position, so the secret word has A as the second letter)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Second guess: ""ratio""
- R: - (present but wrong position)
- A: - (present but wrong position)  → This is critical! Previously A was in the correct position (second), but now in ""ratio"", A is in the second position again but getting a dash (-). This seems contradictory.

Wait, let me check the second guess feedback:
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)

But in the secret word, we know from the first guess that A is in the second position. However, in this second guess, we put A in the second position again, and now the feedback says A is present but in the wrong position? That cannot be because if A is fixed in the second position, then putting A in second should always give a check.

Unless... the secret word has more than one A? Because if the secret word has two A's, then one of them is in the correct position (second), but if we put an A in the second position again, it might not be marked as correct? Actually, no, the feedback rules:

The usual Wordle rule: 
- If a letter is correct and in the right position, it gets a ✓, regardless of duplicates?
- However, if there is only one A in the secret word, and it's in the second position, then when we put A in the second position we should get ✓ always.

But here we got A(-) meaning present but wrong position? That implies that in the secret word, A is not in the second position? But that contradicts the first feedback.

Wait, the first feedback: for ""crane"", we had A(✓) in the second position. That means the second letter of the secret word is A. So when we guess ""ratio"", which has A in the second position, we should again get ✓ for A.

But we got A(-) for A? This is inconsistent unless the game changed? Or I misunderstood.

Possible explanation: 
- The secret word has exactly one A? Then the A in second position should be always check when guessed there. So getting dash is impossible if it was correct previously.

Wait, unless the feedback for ""ratio"" is entered incorrectly? Or perhaps I misunderstood the feedback format.

Looking back at the user input: ""Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)""

This feedback says A is present but in the wrong position? So what does that mean for the second letter?

But we know from guess 1: the second letter is A. So if in guess 2 we also have A in second, it must be correct? Unless... there is a bug? Or perhaps it's an encoding?

Another possibility: the secret word has two As? So in the first guess, one of the A's was in the correct position? Actually, ""crane"" has only one A? So that A is the only one and it was in the correct position? Then it should be fixed.

But then in the second guess, we put A in second position again -> must be check.

But the feedback says dash? This does not make sense logically.

Unless we are misinterpreting the feedback? The feedback is for each letter:

For ""ratio"":
- R(1): - → present but wrong position? 
- A(2): - → present but wrong position? But position 2? 
- T(3): x → absent
- I(4): x → absent
- O(5): x → absent

But note: if the secret word has A in position 2, then A(2) in ""ratio"" must be check.

So this feedback indicates that A is NOT in the second position? Then that contradicts the first guess where we had A(✓) for position 2.

Now I see the problem. The alternative explanation:

In the first guess, ""crane"" with A(✓) means A is correct and in position 2.

But in the second guess, we did ""ratio"" and for A(2) we get ""-"", meaning that the letter A is in the word but not in the position we guessed? However, since we guessed it in position 2 again, it must mean that the A we discovered is not in position 2? That can't be because we already know it is.

Unless the secret word is not fixed? Or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps we should consider duplicate letters? But ""crane"" had one A and ""ratio"" has one A.

Possible error: the game might have been reset? But no, the user says ""make a new guess"" and provides previous feedback.

Another thought: maybe the feedback for the second guess is relative to the secret word ignoring previous interactions? But that would be foolish.

Actually, for ""ratio"", the A in second position must be correct? Because it was already fixed. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement.

But let's think differently. What if the first feedback was misinterpreted? For ""crane"", the feedback was C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x). So A was marked ✓, meaning it's correct in that position? So it's fixed.

But then for the same position in a new guess to be dash suggests that we are mistaken? Or it could be a system error.

But perhaps we should assume that the feedback is correct? Then we must reconsider the implication.

The only logical explanation is that the secret word has at least two A's? Because:
- In the first guess ""crane"", the A in position 2 was correct (so one A is at position 2).
- In the second guess ""ratio"", the A in position 2 is the same one? So why dash? Unless: the secret word has two A's? And in the second guess, if the secret word has A also in another position? But no.

Actually, the feedback in Wordle handles duplicates? Let me recall: typically, if the secret word has duplicate letters, then we must provide the same number of letters? So if the secret word has two A's and you guess a word with one A, and that A is in the correct position? The other A remains? But I'm confused.

Example from real Wordle? Let me think of an example:

Suppose secret word: APPLE? And we guess CRANE:
C R A N E → APPLE: 
C: absent → x
R: absent (since APPLE doesn't have R) → but wait? In our case R was marked dash? So that's different.

Another example: secret word: BALSA? But let's try:

Secret: BALSA

Guess: crane → 
c: x (no C)
r: (BALSA has no R) → x? But in our first guess we had R(-) so secret must have R.
So impossible.

Another idea: secret word has the second letter not A? But then why did we get A(✓) for position 2 in ""crane""?

Unless... maybe during the first guess, when we had A(✓) it meant that the letter A is in the word and in position 2? So it must be.

But then why is it dash in the second guess?

Unless the game is not standard Wordle? Maybe the feedback doesn't take into account duplicated letters? For instance, if the secret word has a repeated letter? But let's assume that.

Scenario: the secret word has two A's? For example, SECRET: A was in position 2 and also in position 5? For example, word ""PANDA""? But we know from first feedback: R(-), A(✓), and no N, no E, no C? PANDA: PANDA? First guess: crane → 
C: x
R: (PANDA has no R?) so x? But we had R(-) so PANDA cannot be? Because it has no R.

What about ""RADAR""? But RADAR has two A's and one R.

First guess: crane → RADAR? 
C: absent → x
R: first letter? We put R in position2 in ""crane""? 
crane: position1:C,2:R,3:A,4:N,5:E.
 secret word: RADAR: R, A, D, A, R

So:
C: x (absent)
R: in position2? Secret has R in position1 and position5? What happens?
Wordle rule: for R in ""crane"" at position2: 
Secret has R at position1 and position5.
But for position2 in guess, we are comparing to secret's position2? Which is A? So letter R doesn't match. But then it looks for R elsewhere: there is R at position1 and position5. Since position1 is not used yet? Then R at position2 in guess is not in the word at that position? But it is present? So it should be marked as present (dash) because there is an R that is not used? Yes.

Similarly, at position3: A in guess and secret position2 is A? That matches? So check? Wait:

Position1 guess C vs secret R: R isn't used? Later.
Position2 guess R vs secret A: not matching -> but there is R in the secret, so mark as present? So dash.
Position3 guess A vs secret D? D vs A? not match? Then how: secret has A at position2? But position2 is already compared? And position5 is R? And also position1 is R? So for guess position3: A. Does secret have A and not matched? Yes, at positions2 and4? But position2 is not available? Then assign to position4? So yes, A is present? But in the wrong position? So it will be dash? But we had A(✓) for position3.

I'm confused. Let me do step by step for secret ""RADAR"" and guess ""crane"":

secret: R A D A R

guess: C R A N E

- Check positions one by one:
  Position1: C vs R -> no match.
  Position2: R vs A -> no match.
  Position3: A vs D -> no match.
  Position4: N vs A -> no match.
  Position5: E vs R -> no match.

Then, check for yellows:
  C: not in secret -> black/x
  R: in secret at positions1 and5? But since position2 doesn't match and R is not used, mark the second occurrence? How Wordle does it: usually, it processes first for greens, then yellows.

  Instead, standard is: first, mark all exact matches? None? Then mark present letters.

  secret positions: R(0),A(1),D(2),A(3),R(4) [indices 0-4]
  guess: C0: absent -> x
         R1: is in secret? at positions0 or4? But not at position1? Mark one R as present -> - Since we didn't use position0 or4 yet.
         A2: secret has A at positions1 and3. Mark one A as present -> - 
         N3: absent -> x
         E4: absent -> x

So then the feedback would be: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

But then we don't have any green? But we know A is at position3 of guess? But it can be matched with either A in secret? So not fixed.

However, in this case, we wouldn't have A(✓) anywhere? For position3 of guess? We got dash?

But in our first feedback, we had A(✓) for position3? Because in crabarba guess ""crane"", position3 is A and we had ✓. So we only had ✓ for A? That means there was an exact match.

Therefore, for ""crane"", the feedback was:
C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

So that means for the letter in position3 of the guess? It must have matched the secret at position3.

So secret has A at position3? Then why in the second guess for ""ratio"", when we put A in position2, we get dash? But that means secret doesn't have A at position2? But then how can the secret have A at position3 only? But then in ""crane"" we had A at position3 and it was ✓, meaning secret position3 is A.

And in ""ratio"", we put A at position2? If secret position2 is not A, then it might have A elsewhere? But then it should be marked dash if present elsewhere? And we left position3 to be I in ratio? Etc.

 So for ""ratio"":
R at position1: if secret has R but not at position1? Then dash.
A at position2: secret position2 is not A? But we already know from guess1 that secret position3 is A? So secret position2 is something else. But secret must have an A somewhere? Since it has A at position3. Then in ""ratio"", A at position2 is not correct, but A is in the word in position3, so it is present? So it should be dashed.

 So that's consistent.

 Therefore, from guess1: 
   Position3 of secret is A.  (because A at position3 in guess1 was ✓)
   R is in the secret (somewhere) but not in position2? Because in guess1 R was at position2 of guess? But secret position2 is not R? Because position2 might be unknown.

But wait, the feedback for guess1: 
  Position1: C? x
  Position2: R? - (present but wrong position)
  Position3: A? ✓  -> secret position3 is A
  Position4: N? x
  Position5: E? x

So secret has R, but not in position2? And secret has no C, N, E.

Then from guess2 ""ratio"":
  Position1: R? dash - so R is in the word but not at position1? But we know it's in the word.
  Position2: A? dash - so secret has A but not at position2? But we know secret has A? It is at position3? So A should be present elsewhere? So dash is correct because it is present but not at position2.
  Position3: T? x - absent
  Position4: I? x - absent
  Position5: O? x - absent

Therefore, the new information is:
- T, I, O are absent in the secret word.
- R is not in position1 (and we know from guess1 not in position2? And position3 is A? So secret positions: 
Position1: unknown (not C, N, E allowed; but must contain new letters)
Position2: unknown (not R, because in guess1 position2 had R and it was not present at position2? And not C,N,E; and now from guess2, not A? So not R and not A at position2? But A is in the word, but not at position2? Because feedback dash.
Position3: A (fixed)
Position4: unknown (not N,E,C as before, and also from this guess not T,I,O)
Position5: unknown (same as position4)

Additionally, R must be in the word. Since from guess1 we have R(-) and guess2 we have R(-) at position1, and can not be in position2? But position3 is taken by A? So R must be in position4 or position5.

Similarly, we know the secret word has:

- R at either position4 or position5? Because position1 is not available (we guessed R at position1 and got dash? It means R is not in position1? But that only confirms that position1 is not R? And position2 cannot be R because? We know from guess1 that position2 is not R? So only position4 or position5 remain? But position3 is A? So R must be at position4 or5.

Moreover, the secret word has exactly the two occurrences of letters we know? Or more? We know of R and A? But A is at position3? And R must be at position4 or5. But also we have feedback that A is present? But we already have A at position3? Why did they say dash for A in guess2? Because it's already used? Or not. In ""ratio"", we have one A at position2? Which does not match the secret's position2? And the secret has A at position3? Which is not used by the A in that guess? But then the algorithm for Wordle-type games is:

The secret has:
Position: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: ?, 5: ?
And we know secret contains R (at position4 or5) and does not contain C,N,E,T,I,O.

Now the feedback for A:

In guess2, we placed A at position2? Secret has no A at position2? But does secret have another A? We don't know? Currently we only know of one A at position3. So for Letter A: 
There is an A in the secret at position3. But when we guess A at position2, it is not the same A? So the position2 A in guess: 
Does not match secret's position2? And then we have one A in secret at position3? Not used yet? So we mark it as present? Hence the dash.

Yes, so that makes sense.

Summary:

Secret word: 
  Position1: some letter (not R, not A, not C, N, E, T, I, O)
  Position2: some letter (not R, not A, not C, N, E, T, I, O) 
  Position3: A (fixed)
  Position4: must be R or the letter at position4 is R? But also? Could be something else? We know R must be in the word, and it can only be in position4 or5? Because position1 not, position2 not (from guess1), position3 is held by A.

And position4 and5: one of them must be R? Or both? But we don't know duplicate.

Also, all except position3 are unknown letters? But we have constraints: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O. And also not R at positions1 and2? But position2 can be R? No, in guess1 we put R at position2 and it was dash? So secret position2 is not R. Because if it was R, we would have gotten a green R? But we got dash? That means secret has R, but not at that position.

So secret position2 is not R.

Therefore, the secret word has the following structure:

Let me denote:
Pos1: some letter (call it X)
Pos2: some letter (call it Y)
Pos3: A
Pos4: either let's say letter Z or R? 
Pos5: W or R? 
But either pos4 or pos5 is R? Or both could be R? But unknown.

But we know the letter at pos2 cannot be R? And pos1 cannot be R? And pos3 is A? So R must be at pos4 or pos5.

Also, we know there is only one A? Or there might be more? We know at least one? So far in our guesses, words have one A? But secret could have two? We don't know.

To be safe, we must only use the constraints from feedback.

So we have to guess a 5-letter word that:
- Doesn't contain C, N, E, T, I, O -> invalid letters now: C, N, E, T, I, O
- Contains R -> R must be in the word? And we know from feedback
- Has A in the word? But we already know position3 is A.

For the next guess, we need to test the other positions? Especially positions1,2,4,5.

But we also want to find where R is.

We can try to guess a word that has R in position4? Then if it's correct, we get green? Or if not, then it must be at position5.

At the same time, use other common letters for positions1 and2.

Available letters: not C,N,E,T,I,O? What are they? Let's see:
English alphabet minus the known absent: C, E, I, O, T? And N? So absent: C, E, I, O, T, N

Also, we know R and A are present? But A is already placed? So for other positions? R is not placed? So for new letters.

Common letters: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We want to test position4 and5 for R? So make our guess have R at position4 or5?

Also, position2 can be any letter except the invalid ones? And not R? Because if we put R at position2, we know it's not possible? But we won't do that.

So possible word: 
Pattern: _ _ A _ R 
So end with R at position5? With position4 also unknown? Or _A_R_? But position3 is fixed A.

We can think of words ending with R? Or having R at position4.

But also, the we need to test position2? Because we have no information about position2? Except that it is not R? And not A? Etc.

So we want to choose a word that has:

- Letter at position3: A (fixed)
- Have R in position4 or5? To test.
- Letters at positions1 and2 are common and not from the invalid set.

Let's list candidate words:

Ending with R: 
- Words like ____R with position3:A? So 3:A, 5:R.

What is position4? It can be anything? So _ _A # R? where # is a letter? For example, ""BAKER"" has E? Not allowed.

Since position5 is R? We must do XXXAR? Or YY A? R? But wait, position5 R.

The pattern: ? ? A ? R

For example: words: GUARD? Doesn't have A at position3? 
GUARD: G,U,A,R,D -> position3 is A? But A is at position3? Yes? 
GUARD: position1:G,2:U,3:A,4:R,5:D? So not R at position5? Let me count:

Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:R, 5:D? So if we want position5 to be R? That's not.

Words ending with ...AR? Position4:A, position3 it must be? We need a different structure.

For the pattern: position3:A, position5:R -> so the last two letters are ? R? But position4 is letter before R? So ending with "" R"" meaning two letters: then for example: ? ? A X R

 position1,2? A at position3 and R at position5? With position4 being some letter.

For example: 
- ""MAGAR"" is not a word? 
- ""JAGAR""? No

But we need English words.

Another: ""LARGO"", but O is invalid? 
""PAGER"" has E? Invalid.

What about ""SADAR""? Not a word.
 ""BAKAR""? Not English.

 ""HAZAR""? Not common.

Better to think with common letters? Use S, L, D, etc.

""G A L A R""? and then? Word: ""polar""? Position: 1:P,2:O,3:L,4:A,5:R? But O is invalid? And position3 is L not A?

So with A at position3 and R at position5? So we need the third letter to be A? So the word should be 1:?,2:?,3:A,4:?,5:R

Known words: 
- ""cigar"" has C? invalid.
- ""vicar"" has I? invalid.
- ""cedar"" has E,C? invalid.
- ""radar"" has R at position1? But we can put? ""radar"": R at position1? But we know position1 cannot be R? Because ""ratio"" had R at1 and got dash? And also ""radar"" has valid letters? R,A at other positions? But we know R is at position1, but we already know R is not at position1.

So ""radar"" would have position1 R -> but we know it's not R? So not then.

Other words: ""agar"" is 4-letter.

What about using 'S' at beginning: ""sa lar""? ""SAYAR""? Not a word.

""manar"" has M,A,N,A? N is invalid.

""capar"" has C.

So it's difficult? Maybe position4 is R? Then the structure: ? ? A R ?

For example, words that have ""AR"" at position3-4? And then position5 some letter.

Word: ""MARRY"" has two R's? Pos4 R and pos5 Y? Pattern: M A R R Y? But the A is at position2? We want A at position3? So not.

Word with A at position3 and R at position4: so ... A R ... like at positions 3 and4: ""AR"" and then position5 something.

For example:
- ""STAR "" : S T A R something? 5-letter: ""stark"": S,T,A,R,K -> position4 is R? So pattern: 1:S,2:T,3:A,4:R,5:K. This has S,T,K? T is now invalid? Because from guess2 we know T is absent? So ""stark"" uses T? Cannot.

Similarly, ""start"" uses T and T.
""chair"" uses C and I.

""hair"" ? ""HAIRY""?: H A I R Y -> position3 is I? Not A? Also uses I.

But we need position3 A? 

What about ""HAREM""? H A R E M? A at2? Not at3.

""aaron"" has O? invalid.

 Perhaps the secret word has R at position4? And position5 unknown? Or R at position5? But we haven't found many words.

Another possibility: there is a word that has R at position4? And let's accept that position5 is a common letter.

For example: ""AWAKE""? But E? invalid.

""BASTE"" has E? ""BASIL"" has I? ""BAGEL"" has E,G? ""RAGER"" has E? All invalid.

But we can restrict: the invalid letters are C,N,E,T,I,O? So valid letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? and we know R and A are present? But A is placed at position3 and R must be one other.

So for the word, the unknown positions1,2,4,5: must be from the valid letters.

 But also, we know position1 cannot be R? Position2 cannot be R? And position3 is A? R is at position4 or5.

Let us try to choose a word that has R at position4? If we put a word with R at position4, then:
- If R is at position4? We get check? If not, it will be dash if at position5.

Also, while testing other letters.

So word suggestion: let's pick ""SALAD""? But not: S A L A D? Position3 L? And doesn't have R? But R is required? So must include R.

Must have R? So guess a word that includes R.

For example: ""PULLAR""? Not 5 letters.

""RADII"" has R at1 and I? invalid.

""BARNY"" has R? But N and Y? N is invalid.

Perhaps accept that not all popular letters? We need to test R's position. So try a word that has R at position4? Or at5? Let's do position4 R.

So guess a word that has R at position4, and other letter common.

Example: ""sugar"": S U G A R? Wrong pattern? We need the third letter A? sugar: position1:S,2:U,3:G,4:A,5:R? But position3 is G not A? So we want position3 to be A? So we can do word with R at position4 and position3 A? So it includes "" A R"" at positions3-4? And then position1,2,5 are unknown.

English words: 
- ""LIAR ?""  5-letter: ""liard"": L I A R D, but I is invalid? And contains I? which we already know is absent.
- ""guard"": G U A R D -> position3 is A? position4 is R? position5:D? So the word is ""GUARD""? G U A R D.

Letters: G,U,A,R,D? A is at position3? And R at position4? Position5:D? 
Are the letters valid? 
 G: not in invalid set? 
 U: allowed?
 D: allowed
 R: at position4? 
 A: at position3? 

Invalid letters are C, N, E, T, I, O? So G,U,D and R,A are allowed? 

So ""guard"" seems a valid word.

Also, can we check uniqueness? But not necessary.

But we know R? So whether R is at position4? If so, we get a green R? If not, then since R must be in positions4 or5, then if R is at position5, then we will get red for R at position4? And yellow for R at position5? Or not? Wait.

For example, if secret has R at position5:
secret: ? ? A ? R
our guess: G U A R D
For position4: R vs secret position4? not R if secret position4 is something else? And secret position5 is R? 
Then feedback: 
Position1: G vs ? 
Position2: U vs secret position2
Position3: A vs secret A: match -> green
Position4: R vs secret what? The secret position4 is not R? So no match? But R is in secret? Since at position5? Then do we mark yellow? Yes.

If secret has R at position4: then position4: R is green.

So we can distinguish.

Therefore, ""guard"" is a good choice.

Another word? ""MARRY"" has A at position2? Not position3.

So ""guard"" is acceptable.

We can try with other common letters.

Alternative: ""HARSH?"" H A R S H? Position3 is R? Not A.

""PARER"" has E,P,A at2? Not position3.

But we select ""guard"".

But note: we have already used U? And D? We are looking to test.

So we'll guess ""guard"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""guard"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 ""crane"": 
  - A is confirmed in position 3 (✓), so the secret word has ""A"" as its third letter.
  - R is present but misplaced (-), so it must be in position 4 or 5 (not positions 1, 2, or 3 due to feedback constraints).
  - C, N, E are absent (x) and cannot be in the word.

- From Guess 2 ""ratio"":
  - R is still misplaced (-), confirming it cannot be in position 1 (as guessed here) or position 2 (from Guess 1). Combined with position 3 being fixed as ""A"", R must be in either position 4 or 5.
  - A is present but misplaced (-) again. Since position 3 is fixed as ""A"" from Guess 1, this dash likely indicates the position 3 ""A"" is the only one and was not reused, or it could imply multiple ""A""s, but the minimal conclusion is no additional ""A"" at position 2.
  - T, I, O are absent (x) and cannot be in the word.

**Constraints summary:**
- **Position 3 is A** (fixed).
- **R must be in position 4 or 5**.
- **Absent letters:** C, E, I, N, O, T (cannot appear).
- **Remaining positions:** Positions 1, 2, and (4 or 5) need to be guessed using valid letters.
- **Valid letters remaining:** B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).

**Strategy for this guess:**
- Test R in position 4 explicitly: If guessed as R and correct, feedback will show ✓; if misplaced but R is in the word, it may be at position 5.
- Use high-frequency valid letters (e.g., S, L, G, D) for positions 1 and 2 to maximize information.
- Avoid wasting positions on R in non-candidate slots or redundant testing of A.
- Word priority: ""guard"" tests R at position 4 and introduces / tests G, U, D:
  - Positions: G (1), U (2), A (3), R (4), D (5).
  - If R is in position 4, feedback will show ✓; otherwise, it will likely be misplaced (-), and position 5 must be R.
  - U and D are new, common letters to gather more feedback.

If ""guard"" is invalid or risky, alternatives like ""sugar"" or ""larnd"" are possible, but ""sugar"" places ""A"" incorrectly (position 4), and ""larnd"" uses ""L"" and ""D"" effectively—yet ""guard"" optimally targets R's placement.

<guess>guard</guess>",guard,"We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the second position, so the secret word has A as the second letter)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Second guess: ""ratio""
- R: - (present but wrong position)
- A: - (present but wrong position)  → This is critical! Previously A was in the correct position (second), but now in ""ratio"", A is in the second position again but getting a dash (-). This seems contradictory.

Wait, let me check the second guess feedback:
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)

But in the secret word, we know from the first guess that A is in the second position. However, in this second guess, we put A in the second position again, and now the feedback says A is present but in the wrong position? That cannot be because if A is fixed in the second position, then putting A in second should always give a check.

Unless... the secret word has more than one A? Because if the secret word has two A's, then one of them is in the correct position (second), but if we put an A in the second position again, it might not be marked as correct? Actually, no, the feedback rules:

The usual Wordle rule: 
- If a letter is correct and in the right position, it gets a ✓, regardless of duplicates?
- However, if there is only one A in the secret word, and it's in the second position, then when we put A in the second position we should get ✓ always.

But here we got A(-) meaning present but wrong position? That implies that in the secret word, A is not in the second position? But that contradicts the first feedback.

Wait, the first feedback: for ""crane"", we had A(✓) in the second position. That means the second letter of the secret word is A. So when we guess ""ratio"", which has A in the second position, we should again get ✓ for A.

But we got A(-) for A? This is inconsistent unless the game changed? Or I misunderstood.

Possible explanation: 
- The secret word has exactly one A? Then the A in second position should be always check when guessed there. So getting dash is impossible if it was correct previously.

Wait, unless the feedback for ""ratio"" is entered incorrectly? Or perhaps I misunderstood the feedback format.

Looking back at the user input: ""Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)""

This feedback says A is present but in the wrong position? So what does that mean for the second letter?

But we know from guess 1: the second letter is A. So if in guess 2 we also have A in second, it must be correct? Unless... there is a bug? Or perhaps it's an encoding?

Another possibility: the secret word has two As? So in the first guess, one of the A's was in the correct position? Actually, ""crane"" has only one A? So that A is the only one and it was in the correct position? Then it should be fixed.

But then in the second guess, we put A in second position again -> must be check.

But the feedback says dash? This does not make sense logically.

Unless we are misinterpreting the feedback? The feedback is for each letter:

For ""ratio"":
- R(1): - → present but wrong position? 
- A(2): - → present but wrong position? But position 2? 
- T(3): x → absent
- I(4): x → absent
- O(5): x → absent

But note: if the secret word has A in position 2, then A(2) in ""ratio"" must be check.

So this feedback indicates that A is NOT in the second position? Then that contradicts the first guess where we had A(✓) for position 2.

Now I see the problem. The alternative explanation:

In the first guess, ""crane"" with A(✓) means A is correct and in position 2.

But in the second guess, we did ""ratio"" and for A(2) we get ""-"", meaning that the letter A is in the word but not in the position we guessed? However, since we guessed it in position 2 again, it must mean that the A we discovered is not in position 2? That can't be because we already know it is.

Unless the secret word is not fixed? Or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps we should consider duplicate letters? But ""crane"" had one A and ""ratio"" has one A.

Possible error: the game might have been reset? But no, the user says ""make a new guess"" and provides previous feedback.

Another thought: maybe the feedback for the second guess is relative to the secret word ignoring previous interactions? But that would be foolish.

Actually, for ""ratio"", the A in second position must be correct? Because it was already fixed. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement.

But let's think differently. What if the first feedback was misinterpreted? For ""crane"", the feedback was C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x). So A was marked ✓, meaning it's correct in that position? So it's fixed.

But then for the same position in a new guess to be dash suggests that we are mistaken? Or it could be a system error.

But perhaps we should assume that the feedback is correct? Then we must reconsider the implication.

The only logical explanation is that the secret word has at least two A's? Because:
- In the first guess ""crane"", the A in position 2 was correct (so one A is at position 2).
- In the second guess ""ratio"", the A in position 2 is the same one? So why dash? Unless: the secret word has two A's? And in the second guess, if the secret word has A also in another position? But no.

Actually, the feedback in Wordle handles duplicates? Let me recall: typically, if the secret word has duplicate letters, then we must provide the same number of letters? So if the secret word has two A's and you guess a word with one A, and that A is in the correct position? The other A remains? But I'm confused.

Example from real Wordle? Let me think of an example:

Suppose secret word: APPLE? And we guess CRANE:
C R A N E → APPLE: 
C: absent → x
R: absent (since APPLE doesn't have R) → but wait? In our case R was marked dash? So that's different.

Another example: secret word: BALSA? But let's try:

Secret: BALSA

Guess: crane → 
c: x (no C)
r: (BALSA has no R) → x? But in our first guess we had R(-) so secret must have R.
So impossible.

Another idea: secret word has the second letter not A? But then why did we get A(✓) for position 2 in ""crane""?

Unless... maybe during the first guess, when we had A(✓) it meant that the letter A is in the word and in position 2? So it must be.

But then why is it dash in the second guess?

Unless the game is not standard Wordle? Maybe the feedback doesn't take into account duplicated letters? For instance, if the secret word has a repeated letter? But let's assume that.

Scenario: the secret word has two A's? For example, SECRET: A was in position 2 and also in position 5? For example, word ""PANDA""? But we know from first feedback: R(-), A(✓), and no N, no E, no C? PANDA: PANDA? First guess: crane → 
C: x
R: (PANDA has no R?) so x? But we had R(-) so PANDA cannot be? Because it has no R.

What about ""RADAR""? But RADAR has two A's and one R.

First guess: crane → RADAR? 
C: absent → x
R: first letter? We put R in position2 in ""crane""? 
crane: position1:C,2:R,3:A,4:N,5:E.
 secret word: RADAR: R, A, D, A, R

So:
C: x (absent)
R: in position2? Secret has R in position1 and position5? What happens?
Wordle rule: for R in ""crane"" at position2: 
Secret has R at position1 and position5.
But for position2 in guess, we are comparing to secret's position2? Which is A? So letter R doesn't match. But then it looks for R elsewhere: there is R at position1 and position5. Since position1 is not used yet? Then R at position2 in guess is not in the word at that position? But it is present? So it should be marked as present (dash) because there is an R that is not used? Yes.

Similarly, at position3: A in guess and secret position2 is A? That matches? So check? Wait:

Position1 guess C vs secret R: R isn't used? Later.
Position2 guess R vs secret A: not matching -> but there is R in the secret, so mark as present? So dash.
Position3 guess A vs secret D? D vs A? not match? Then how: secret has A at position2? But position2 is already compared? And position5 is R? And also position1 is R? So for guess position3: A. Does secret have A and not matched? Yes, at positions2 and4? But position2 is not available? Then assign to position4? So yes, A is present? But in the wrong position? So it will be dash? But we had A(✓) for position3.

I'm confused. Let me do step by step for secret ""RADAR"" and guess ""crane"":

secret: R A D A R

guess: C R A N E

- Check positions one by one:
  Position1: C vs R -> no match.
  Position2: R vs A -> no match.
  Position3: A vs D -> no match.
  Position4: N vs A -> no match.
  Position5: E vs R -> no match.

Then, check for yellows:
  C: not in secret -> black/x
  R: in secret at positions1 and5? But since position2 doesn't match and R is not used, mark the second occurrence? How Wordle does it: usually, it processes first for greens, then yellows.

  Instead, standard is: first, mark all exact matches? None? Then mark present letters.

  secret positions: R(0),A(1),D(2),A(3),R(4) [indices 0-4]
  guess: C0: absent -> x
         R1: is in secret? at positions0 or4? But not at position1? Mark one R as present -> - Since we didn't use position0 or4 yet.
         A2: secret has A at positions1 and3. Mark one A as present -> - 
         N3: absent -> x
         E4: absent -> x

So then the feedback would be: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

But then we don't have any green? But we know A is at position3 of guess? But it can be matched with either A in secret? So not fixed.

However, in this case, we wouldn't have A(✓) anywhere? For position3 of guess? We got dash?

But in our first feedback, we had A(✓) for position3? Because in crabarba guess ""crane"", position3 is A and we had ✓. So we only had ✓ for A? That means there was an exact match.

Therefore, for ""crane"", the feedback was:
C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

So that means for the letter in position3 of the guess? It must have matched the secret at position3.

So secret has A at position3? Then why in the second guess for ""ratio"", when we put A in position2, we get dash? But that means secret doesn't have A at position2? But then how can the secret have A at position3 only? But then in ""crane"" we had A at position3 and it was ✓, meaning secret position3 is A.

And in ""ratio"", we put A at position2? If secret position2 is not A, then it might have A elsewhere? But then it should be marked dash if present elsewhere? And we left position3 to be I in ratio? Etc.

 So for ""ratio"":
R at position1: if secret has R but not at position1? Then dash.
A at position2: secret position2 is not A? But we already know from guess1 that secret position3 is A? So secret position2 is something else. But secret must have an A somewhere? Since it has A at position3. Then in ""ratio"", A at position2 is not correct, but A is in the word in position3, so it is present? So it should be dashed.

 So that's consistent.

 Therefore, from guess1: 
   Position3 of secret is A.  (because A at position3 in guess1 was ✓)
   R is in the secret (somewhere) but not in position2? Because in guess1 R was at position2 of guess? But secret position2 is not R? Because position2 might be unknown.

But wait, the feedback for guess1: 
  Position1: C? x
  Position2: R? - (present but wrong position)
  Position3: A? ✓  -> secret position3 is A
  Position4: N? x
  Position5: E? x

So secret has R, but not in position2? And secret has no C, N, E.

Then from guess2 ""ratio"":
  Position1: R? dash - so R is in the word but not at position1? But we know it's in the word.
  Position2: A? dash - so secret has A but not at position2? But we know secret has A? It is at position3? So A should be present elsewhere? So dash is correct because it is present but not at position2.
  Position3: T? x - absent
  Position4: I? x - absent
  Position5: O? x - absent

Therefore, the new information is:
- T, I, O are absent in the secret word.
- R is not in position1 (and we know from guess1 not in position2? And position3 is A? So secret positions: 
Position1: unknown (not C, N, E allowed; but must contain new letters)
Position2: unknown (not R, because in guess1 position2 had R and it was not present at position2? And not C,N,E; and now from guess2, not A? So not R and not A at position2? But A is in the word, but not at position2? Because feedback dash.
Position3: A (fixed)
Position4: unknown (not N,E,C as before, and also from this guess not T,I,O)
Position5: unknown (same as position4)

Additionally, R must be in the word. Since from guess1 we have R(-) and guess2 we have R(-) at position1, and can not be in position2? But position3 is taken by A? So R must be in position4 or position5.

Similarly, we know the secret word has:

- R at either position4 or position5? Because position1 is not available (we guessed R at position1 and got dash? It means R is not in position1? But that only confirms that position1 is not R? And position2 cannot be R because? We know from guess1 that position2 is not R? So only position4 or position5 remain? But position3 is A? So R must be at position4 or5.

Moreover, the secret word has exactly the two occurrences of letters we know? Or more? We know of R and A? But A is at position3? And R must be at position4 or5. But also we have feedback that A is present? But we already have A at position3? Why did they say dash for A in guess2? Because it's already used? Or not. In ""ratio"", we have one A at position2? Which does not match the secret's position2? And the secret has A at position3? Which is not used by the A in that guess? But then the algorithm for Wordle-type games is:

The secret has:
Position: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: ?, 5: ?
And we know secret contains R (at position4 or5) and does not contain C,N,E,T,I,O.

Now the feedback for A:

In guess2, we placed A at position2? Secret has no A at position2? But does secret have another A? We don't know? Currently we only know of one A at position3. So for Letter A: 
There is an A in the secret at position3. But when we guess A at position2, it is not the same A? So the position2 A in guess: 
Does not match secret's position2? And then we have one A in secret at position3? Not used yet? So we mark it as present? Hence the dash.

Yes, so that makes sense.

Summary:

Secret word: 
  Position1: some letter (not R, not A, not C, N, E, T, I, O)
  Position2: some letter (not R, not A, not C, N, E, T, I, O) 
  Position3: A (fixed)
  Position4: must be R or the letter at position4 is R? But also? Could be something else? We know R must be in the word, and it can only be in position4 or5? Because position1 not, position2 not (from guess1), position3 is held by A.

And position4 and5: one of them must be R? Or both? But we don't know duplicate.

Also, all except position3 are unknown letters? But we have constraints: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O. And also not R at positions1 and2? But position2 can be R? No, in guess1 we put R at position2 and it was dash? So secret position2 is not R. Because if it was R, we would have gotten a green R? But we got dash? That means secret has R, but not at that position.

So secret position2 is not R.

Therefore, the secret word has the following structure:

Let me denote:
Pos1: some letter (call it X)
Pos2: some letter (call it Y)
Pos3: A
Pos4: either let's say letter Z or R? 
Pos5: W or R? 
But either pos4 or pos5 is R? Or both could be R? But unknown.

But we know the letter at pos2 cannot be R? And pos1 cannot be R? And pos3 is A? So R must be at pos4 or pos5.

Also, we know there is only one A? Or there might be more? We know at least one? So far in our guesses, words have one A? But secret could have two? We don't know.

To be safe, we must only use the constraints from feedback.

So we have to guess a 5-letter word that:
- Doesn't contain C, N, E, T, I, O -> invalid letters now: C, N, E, T, I, O
- Contains R -> R must be in the word? And we know from feedback
- Has A in the word? But we already know position3 is A.

For the next guess, we need to test the other positions? Especially positions1,2,4,5.

But we also want to find where R is.

We can try to guess a word that has R in position4? Then if it's correct, we get green? Or if not, then it must be at position5.

At the same time, use other common letters for positions1 and2.

Available letters: not C,N,E,T,I,O? What are they? Let's see:
English alphabet minus the known absent: C, E, I, O, T? And N? So absent: C, E, I, O, T, N

Also, we know R and A are present? But A is already placed? So for other positions? R is not placed? So for new letters.

Common letters: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We want to test position4 and5 for R? So make our guess have R at position4 or5?

Also, position2 can be any letter except the invalid ones? And not R? Because if we put R at position2, we know it's not possible? But we won't do that.

So possible word: 
Pattern: _ _ A _ R 
So end with R at position5? With position4 also unknown? Or _A_R_? But position3 is fixed A.

We can think of words ending with R? Or having R at position4.

But also, the we need to test position2? Because we have no information about position2? Except that it is not R? And not A? Etc.

So we want to choose a word that has:

- Letter at position3: A (fixed)
- Have R in position4 or5? To test.
- Letters at positions1 and2 are common and not from the invalid set.

Let's list candidate words:

Ending with R: 
- Words like ____R with position3:A? So 3:A, 5:R.

What is position4? It can be anything? So _ _A # R? where # is a letter? For example, ""BAKER"" has E? Not allowed.

Since position5 is R? We must do XXXAR? Or YY A? R? But wait, position5 R.

The pattern: ? ? A ? R

For example: words: GUARD? Doesn't have A at position3? 
GUARD: G,U,A,R,D -> position3 is A? But A is at position3? Yes? 
GUARD: position1:G,2:U,3:A,4:R,5:D? So not R at position5? Let me count:

Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:R, 5:D? So if we want position5 to be R? That's not.

Words ending with ...AR? Position4:A, position3 it must be? We need a different structure.

For the pattern: position3:A, position5:R -> so the last two letters are ? R? But position4 is letter before R? So ending with "" R"" meaning two letters: then for example: ? ? A X R

 position1,2? A at position3 and R at position5? With position4 being some letter.

For example: 
- ""MAGAR"" is not a word? 
- ""JAGAR""? No

But we need English words.

Another: ""LARGO"", but O is invalid? 
""PAGER"" has E? Invalid.

What about ""SADAR""? Not a word.
 ""BAKAR""? Not English.

 ""HAZAR""? Not common.

Better to think with common letters? Use S, L, D, etc.

""G A L A R""? and then? Word: ""polar""? Position: 1:P,2:O,3:L,4:A,5:R? But O is invalid? And position3 is L not A?

So with A at position3 and R at position5? So we need the third letter to be A? So the word should be 1:?,2:?,3:A,4:?,5:R

Known words: 
- ""cigar"" has C? invalid.
- ""vicar"" has I? invalid.
- ""cedar"" has E,C? invalid.
- ""radar"" has R at position1? But we can put? ""radar"": R at position1? But we know position1 cannot be R? Because ""ratio"" had R at1 and got dash? And also ""radar"" has valid letters? R,A at other positions? But we know R is at position1, but we already know R is not at position1.

So ""radar"" would have position1 R -> but we know it's not R? So not then.

Other words: ""agar"" is 4-letter.

What about using 'S' at beginning: ""sa lar""? ""SAYAR""? Not a word.

""manar"" has M,A,N,A? N is invalid.

""capar"" has C.

So it's difficult? Maybe position4 is R? Then the structure: ? ? A R ?

For example, words that have ""AR"" at position3-4? And then position5 some letter.

Word: ""MARRY"" has two R's? Pos4 R and pos5 Y? Pattern: M A R R Y? But the A is at position2? We want A at position3? So not.

Word with A at position3 and R at position4: so ... A R ... like at positions 3 and4: ""AR"" and then position5 something.

For example:
- ""STAR "" : S T A R something? 5-letter: ""stark"": S,T,A,R,K -> position4 is R? So pattern: 1:S,2:T,3:A,4:R,5:K. This has S,T,K? T is now invalid? Because from guess2 we know T is absent? So ""stark"" uses T? Cannot.

Similarly, ""start"" uses T and T.
""chair"" uses C and I.

""hair"" ? ""HAIRY""?: H A I R Y -> position3 is I? Not A? Also uses I.

But we need position3 A? 

What about ""HAREM""? H A R E M? A at2? Not at3.

""aaron"" has O? invalid.

 Perhaps the secret word has R at position4? And position5 unknown? Or R at position5? But we haven't found many words.

Another possibility: there is a word that has R at position4? And let's accept that position5 is a common letter.

For example: ""AWAKE""? But E? invalid.

""BASTE"" has E? ""BASIL"" has I? ""BAGEL"" has E,G? ""RAGER"" has E? All invalid.

But we can restrict: the invalid letters are C,N,E,T,I,O? So valid letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? and we know R and A are present? But A is placed at position3 and R must be one other.

So for the word, the unknown positions1,2,4,5: must be from the valid letters.

 But also, we know position1 cannot be R? Position2 cannot be R? And position3 is A? R is at position4 or5.

Let us try to choose a word that has R at position4? If we put a word with R at position4, then:
- If R is at position4? We get check? If not, it will be dash if at position5.

Also, while testing other letters.

So word suggestion: let's pick ""SALAD""? But not: S A L A D? Position3 L? And doesn't have R? But R is required? So must include R.

Must have R? So guess a word that includes R.

For example: ""PULLAR""? Not 5 letters.

""RADII"" has R at1 and I? invalid.

""BARNY"" has R? But N and Y? N is invalid.

Perhaps accept that not all popular letters? We need to test R's position. So try a word that has R at position4? Or at5? Let's do position4 R.

So guess a word that has R at position4, and other letter common.

Example: ""sugar"": S U G A R? Wrong pattern? We need the third letter A? sugar: position1:S,2:U,3:G,4:A,5:R? But position3 is G not A? So we want position3 to be A? So we can do word with R at position4 and position3 A? So it includes "" A R"" at positions3-4? And then position1,2,5 are unknown.

English words: 
- ""LIAR ?""  5-letter: ""liard"": L I A R D, but I is invalid? And contains I? which we already know is absent.
- ""guard"": G U A R D -> position3 is A? position4 is R? position5:D? So the word is ""GUARD""? G U A R D.

Letters: G,U,A,R,D? A is at position3? And R at position4? Position5:D? 
Are the letters valid? 
 G: not in invalid set? 
 U: allowed?
 D: allowed
 R: at position4? 
 A: at position3? 

Invalid letters are C, N, E, T, I, O? So G,U,D and R,A are allowed? 

So ""guard"" seems a valid word.

Also, can we check uniqueness? But not necessary.

But we know R? So whether R is at position4? If so, we get a green R? If not, then since R must be in positions4 or5, then if R is at position5, then we will get red for R at position4? And yellow for R at position5? Or not? Wait.

For example, if secret has R at position5:
secret: ? ? A ? R
our guess: G U A R D
For position4: R vs secret position4? not R if secret position4 is something else? And secret position5 is R? 
Then feedback: 
Position1: G vs ? 
Position2: U vs secret position2
Position3: A vs secret A: match -> green
Position4: R vs secret what? The secret position4 is not R? So no match? But R is in secret? Since at position5? Then do we mark yellow? Yes.

If secret has R at position4: then position4: R is green.

So we can distinguish.

Therefore, ""guard"" is a good choice.

Another word? ""MARRY"" has A at position2? Not position3.

So ""guard"" is acceptable.

We can try with other common letters.

Alternative: ""HARSH?"" H A R S H? Position3 is R? Not A.

""PARER"" has E,P,A at2? Not position3.

But we select ""guard"".

But note: we have already used U? And D? We are looking to test.

So we'll guess ""guard"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""guard"".After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 ""crane"": 
  - A is confirmed in position 3 (✓), so the secret word has ""A"" as its third letter.
  - R is present but misplaced (-), so it must be in position 4 or 5 (not positions 1, 2, or 3 due to feedback constraints).
  - C, N, E are absent (x) and cannot be in the word.

- From Guess 2 ""ratio"":
  - R is still misplaced (-), confirming it cannot be in position 1 (as guessed here) or position 2 (from Guess 1). Combined with position 3 being fixed as ""A"", R must be in either position 4 or 5.
  - A is present but misplaced (-) again. Since position 3 is fixed as ""A"" from Guess 1, this dash likely indicates the position 3 ""A"" is the only one and was not reused, or it could imply multiple ""A""s, but the minimal conclusion is no additional ""A"" at position 2.
  - T, I, O are absent (x) and cannot be in the word.

**Constraints summary:**
- **Position 3 is A** (fixed).
- **R must be in position 4 or 5**.
- **Absent letters:** C, E, I, N, O, T (cannot appear).
- **Remaining positions:** Positions 1, 2, and (4 or 5) need to be guessed using valid letters.
- **Valid letters remaining:** B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).

**Strategy for this guess:**
- Test R in position 4 explicitly: If guessed as R and correct, feedback will show ✓; if misplaced but R is in the word, it may be at position 5.
- Use high-frequency valid letters (e.g., S, L, G, D) for positions 1 and 2 to maximize information.
- Avoid wasting positions on R in non-candidate slots or redundant testing of A.
- Word priority: ""guard"" tests R at position 4 and introduces / tests G, U, D:
  - Positions: G (1), U (2), A (3), R (4), D (5).
  - If R is in position 4, feedback will show ✓; otherwise, it will likely be misplaced (-), and position 5 must be R.
  - U and D are new, common letters to gather more feedback.

If ""guard"" is invalid or risky, alternatives like ""sugar"" or ""larnd"" are possible, but ""sugar"" places ""A"" incorrectly (position 4), and ""larnd"" uses ""L"" and ""D"" effectively—yet ""guard"" optimally targets R's placement.",Guess 3: guard -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,award,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x -> not in the secret word
  R: - -> in the secret word but not in the first position
  A: ✓ -> correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is A)
  N: x -> not in the secret word
  E: x -> not in the secret word

So we know:
- The secret word has the letter R, but not in the second position (because R was in the first guess's second position and got '-', meaning it's in the word but misplaced).
- The second letter of the secret word is A (because A got a checkmark in the second position).
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.

Also, we know that the secret word does not contain C, N, E.

We must form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has the letter A in the second position (since it's confirmed there).
- Includes the letter R (because we know it's present) but not in the second position? Actually, in our guess, R was in the second position and it was misplaced. But note: the feedback for R is '-' meaning it is in the word, just not in that position. However, we don't know where it actually is. It could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Also, we know from the feedback that the secret word does not start with C (because C is absent), and the second letter is A. So the word has the form: _ A _ _ _

Now, our next guess should try to test more letters and also position the known letters appropriately.

Constraints:
- Avoid C, N, E.
- Must include R (somewhere except the second position? Actually, we can put R in any position except the second because we know it's not there? But wait: it's possible that R could appear multiple times? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates. Since the feedback doesn't show duplicates unless they are in the word multiple times, and we only have one R in ""crane"", we don't know. But typically, we assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

However, note the feedback: for ""crane"", we got one R marked as present (misplaced) and the others absent. So the secret word has at least one R.

We also know the secret word has the letter A in the second position and doesn't have C, N, E.

We should focus on using other common letters and try to place R appropriately.

Possible positions for R: since it cannot be in the second position, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But note: our guess ""crane"" had R in position 2, which was wrong. So R must be elsewhere, but we don't know which of the other positions.

For the next guess, we want to test R in a different position and also introduce new common letters.

Let me think of a word that:
- Second letter is A (fixed).
- Includes R (somewhere except second position).
- Does not contain C, N, E.
- Includes other common letters (like S, T, L, etc.)

Common letters: we can try S, T, L, I, O, P, etc.

Example words with second letter A and including R?

Let's try some possibilities:

- Start with R? e.g., words like: RAMPS, but we have to avoid N and E? Wait RAMPS: R (position1), A (position2), M (position3), P (position4), S (position5). But we don't know about M, P, S yet.

But note we can't use E, so avoid words ending in E? RAMPS avoids E.

Alternatively: PARTY: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). This uses common letters and includes R in third position.

But we don't know if P, T, Y are present.

Another: BARDS? B(1),A(2),R(3),D(4),S(5). Avoids the forbidden letters.

But we have two unknowns: we have R and also B, D, S.

However, we also want to cover more ground. Maybe choose a word with S, T, L? Since we know A and R are present, we can focus on other high-frequency letters.

Let me think: we have the second letter fixed as A. We need R somewhere else. And we avoid C, N, E.

Let's list some words that fit:
- SMART: S(1), A(2), M(3), R(4), T(5). This includes S, M, T and R. But note: we already tried C? But here S and T are new.

Also, note: we are going to get feedback on each letter again.

We could also try to see if the first letter is known? We don't have any hint about the first letter except it cannot be C (because C is absent). So any letter except C and also not N, E (but since the first letter cannot be C, N, E? Actually, we know the word doesn't have N and E anywhere). So the first letter cannot be C, N, E? It can be any other letter except C, N, E? Actually, we know the word doesn't contain C, N, E at all. So the first letter must be from the remaining 23 letters.

So all letters in the word must avoid C, N, E.

Therefore, SMART: letters S, A, M, R, T: none of which are C, N, E -> valid.

But we have R in the fourth position? Let me check the feedback: if we guess ""smart"", then:
- S: new letter -> could be anywhere?
- A: already in second position, so that should get a checkmark.
- R: in fourth position. We know from our previous feedback that R is in the word but not in the second position. We don't know about the fourth position.

We might get more information.

Alternatively, another word: TARES? But E is forbidden? Oh, TARES has E? So avoid since E is absent? Our feedback says E is not in the word, so TARES has E -> invalid.

Another word: PARTY: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). This avoids C, N, E.

Similarly, we could consider: BARKS: but K? and S? And B is new.

But let me go with SMART because it has common letters S, M, T and R, and we get A again in the second position which we know is fixed. And we test R in the fourth position.

But note: in our previous guess, R was in position 2 and was wrong. Now we put R in position 4. If R is actually in position 1, 3, or 5, then putting it in 4 will get a '-' or even a checkmark? We don't know.

However, we are trying to gather more information.

Another idea: we know the word has R and A in the second position. We can try a word with R in the first position to test that. Because if R is in first, then we might get a checkmark.

So words like: R A _ _ _ 
But no C, N, E.

Examples: RAPID? But we don't know if P, I, D are present? and we avoid E.

But note: we haven't used any of R, A in other positions? Actually, A is fixed in second.

So R A ? ? ? 

Possible words: RALLY? but L and Y and L? Letters: R, A, L, L -> but duplicates? We avoid duplicates? Actually, we can have duplicates? But we don't know. However, we have no information. But RALLY has two L's? We should avoid for now? Maybe choose without duplicates.

RANKS? but we know N is absent -> invalid because N is not in the word? RANKS contains N -> invalid.

RACER? contains C and E -> invalid.

So what about: RATIO? but contains T and I and O? and avoids C,N,E? Yes.

RATIO: R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). This tests R in position 1. And we test T, I, O.

But note: we already have A in the second position, so that part is safe.

So RATIO might be a good guess? Because it tests R at position one and adds common letters T, I, O.

Alternatively, we could try RABID? but B and I? and D? RABID: R(1),A(2),B(3),I(4),D(5). Avoids C,N,E.

But T and O might be more common? Actually, from letter frequency, E is most common but absent, then T, A, O, I, N (which is absent), S, etc. So T, O, I, S are good.

Therefore, RATIO is a good candidate.

Another: PARTS? P,A,R,T,S -> that's five distinct? P(1),A(2),R(3),T(4),S(5). This places R in the third position? And we avoid the second position? Yes.

But note: we haven't tested the positions close to the beginning? But RATIO tests position 1 for R.

I think testing R at position 1 is a good idea because if it's correct we get a checkmark, and if it's not, we know it must be in 3,4,5? Wait, we know it's not in position 2.

So let me choose RATIO.

But another consideration: we already know that the secret word does not contain C, N, E. And we are trying to find the position of R.

I'll go with RATIO because it uses R in first position and common letters T, I, O.

So my next guess is ""ratio"".

But wait: what about the feedback? In our previous guess, we had ""crane"" and got R as misplaced. Now when we put R in first position, we might get:
- If R is the first letter, then ✓
- If R is not in the first, but is present, then '-' (and then we know R is not in position1 either)
- Or worst, if R is not present? but it must be because we got a '-' in the first guess? So it must be present.

So we'll either get R with ✓ or with '-'.

Similarly for A: we know it's in the second position, so it should always be ✓.

So without loss, we can get feedback on the new letters.

Therefore, let's guess ""ratio"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is absent (x) → not in the secret word
- R is present but misplaced (-) → in the secret word, not in position 2
- A is correct and in position (✓) → second letter is A
- N is absent (x) → not in the secret word
- E is absent (x) → not in the secret word

Constraints derived:
- The secret word has the form _ A _ _ _
- Must contain R (somewhere except position 2)
- Cannot contain C, N, E
- Letters to prioritize for new information: common consonants (e.g., T, S, L, D) and vowels (e.g., I, O, U)

Strategy for this guess:
- Include R in a new position (position 1 is tested here to quickly validate/invalidate it as a starting letter)
- Retain A in position 2 (since it's confirmed)
- Avoid C, N, E entirely
- Introduce new high-frequency letters (T, I, O) to maximize feedback information
- Choose a word that fits: ""ratio"" meets these criteria (R in position 1, A in position 2, and testing T, I, O)

If R is in position 1, we may receive a ✓ for R, confirming its position. If R is misplaced again, we narrow its possible locations to positions 3–5. Feedback on T, I, and O will further reduce possibilities.

<guess>ratio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the second position, so the secret word has A as the second letter)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Second guess: ""ratio""
- R: - (present but wrong position)
- A: - (present but wrong position)  → This is critical! Previously A was in the correct position (second), but now in ""ratio"", A is in the second position again but getting a dash (-). This seems contradictory.

Wait, let me check the second guess feedback:
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)

But in the secret word, we know from the first guess that A is in the second position. However, in this second guess, we put A in the second position again, and now the feedback says A is present but in the wrong position? That cannot be because if A is fixed in the second position, then putting A in second should always give a check.

Unless... the secret word has more than one A? Because if the secret word has two A's, then one of them is in the correct position (second), but if we put an A in the second position again, it might not be marked as correct? Actually, no, the feedback rules:

The usual Wordle rule: 
- If a letter is correct and in the right position, it gets a ✓, regardless of duplicates?
- However, if there is only one A in the secret word, and it's in the second position, then when we put A in the second position we should get ✓ always.

But here we got A(-) meaning present but wrong position? That implies that in the secret word, A is not in the second position? But that contradicts the first feedback.

Wait, the first feedback: for ""crane"", we had A(✓) in the second position. That means the second letter of the secret word is A. So when we guess ""ratio"", which has A in the second position, we should again get ✓ for A.

But we got A(-) for A? This is inconsistent unless the game changed? Or I misunderstood.

Possible explanation: 
- The secret word has exactly one A? Then the A in second position should be always check when guessed there. So getting dash is impossible if it was correct previously.

Wait, unless the feedback for ""ratio"" is entered incorrectly? Or perhaps I misunderstood the feedback format.

Looking back at the user input: ""Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)""

This feedback says A is present but in the wrong position? So what does that mean for the second letter?

But we know from guess 1: the second letter is A. So if in guess 2 we also have A in second, it must be correct? Unless... there is a bug? Or perhaps it's an encoding?

Another possibility: the secret word has two As? So in the first guess, one of the A's was in the correct position? Actually, ""crane"" has only one A? So that A is the only one and it was in the correct position? Then it should be fixed.

But then in the second guess, we put A in second position again -> must be check.

But the feedback says dash? This does not make sense logically.

Unless we are misinterpreting the feedback? The feedback is for each letter:

For ""ratio"":
- R(1): - → present but wrong position? 
- A(2): - → present but wrong position? But position 2? 
- T(3): x → absent
- I(4): x → absent
- O(5): x → absent

But note: if the secret word has A in position 2, then A(2) in ""ratio"" must be check.

So this feedback indicates that A is NOT in the second position? Then that contradicts the first guess where we had A(✓) for position 2.

Now I see the problem. The alternative explanation:

In the first guess, ""crane"" with A(✓) means A is correct and in position 2.

But in the second guess, we did ""ratio"" and for A(2) we get ""-"", meaning that the letter A is in the word but not in the position we guessed? However, since we guessed it in position 2 again, it must mean that the A we discovered is not in position 2? That can't be because we already know it is.

Unless the secret word is not fixed? Or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps we should consider duplicate letters? But ""crane"" had one A and ""ratio"" has one A.

Possible error: the game might have been reset? But no, the user says ""make a new guess"" and provides previous feedback.

Another thought: maybe the feedback for the second guess is relative to the secret word ignoring previous interactions? But that would be foolish.

Actually, for ""ratio"", the A in second position must be correct? Because it was already fixed. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement.

But let's think differently. What if the first feedback was misinterpreted? For ""crane"", the feedback was C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x). So A was marked ✓, meaning it's correct in that position? So it's fixed.

But then for the same position in a new guess to be dash suggests that we are mistaken? Or it could be a system error.

But perhaps we should assume that the feedback is correct? Then we must reconsider the implication.

The only logical explanation is that the secret word has at least two A's? Because:
- In the first guess ""crane"", the A in position 2 was correct (so one A is at position 2).
- In the second guess ""ratio"", the A in position 2 is the same one? So why dash? Unless: the secret word has two A's? And in the second guess, if the secret word has A also in another position? But no.

Actually, the feedback in Wordle handles duplicates? Let me recall: typically, if the secret word has duplicate letters, then we must provide the same number of letters? So if the secret word has two A's and you guess a word with one A, and that A is in the correct position? The other A remains? But I'm confused.

Example from real Wordle? Let me think of an example:

Suppose secret word: APPLE? And we guess CRANE:
C R A N E → APPLE: 
C: absent → x
R: absent (since APPLE doesn't have R) → but wait? In our case R was marked dash? So that's different.

Another example: secret word: BALSA? But let's try:

Secret: BALSA

Guess: crane → 
c: x (no C)
r: (BALSA has no R) → x? But in our first guess we had R(-) so secret must have R.
So impossible.

Another idea: secret word has the second letter not A? But then why did we get A(✓) for position 2 in ""crane""?

Unless... maybe during the first guess, when we had A(✓) it meant that the letter A is in the word and in position 2? So it must be.

But then why is it dash in the second guess?

Unless the game is not standard Wordle? Maybe the feedback doesn't take into account duplicated letters? For instance, if the secret word has a repeated letter? But let's assume that.

Scenario: the secret word has two A's? For example, SECRET: A was in position 2 and also in position 5? For example, word ""PANDA""? But we know from first feedback: R(-), A(✓), and no N, no E, no C? PANDA: PANDA? First guess: crane → 
C: x
R: (PANDA has no R?) so x? But we had R(-) so PANDA cannot be? Because it has no R.

What about ""RADAR""? But RADAR has two A's and one R.

First guess: crane → RADAR? 
C: absent → x
R: first letter? We put R in position2 in ""crane""? 
crane: position1:C,2:R,3:A,4:N,5:E.
 secret word: RADAR: R, A, D, A, R

So:
C: x (absent)
R: in position2? Secret has R in position1 and position5? What happens?
Wordle rule: for R in ""crane"" at position2: 
Secret has R at position1 and position5.
But for position2 in guess, we are comparing to secret's position2? Which is A? So letter R doesn't match. But then it looks for R elsewhere: there is R at position1 and position5. Since position1 is not used yet? Then R at position2 in guess is not in the word at that position? But it is present? So it should be marked as present (dash) because there is an R that is not used? Yes.

Similarly, at position3: A in guess and secret position2 is A? That matches? So check? Wait:

Position1 guess C vs secret R: R isn't used? Later.
Position2 guess R vs secret A: not matching -> but there is R in the secret, so mark as present? So dash.
Position3 guess A vs secret D? D vs A? not match? Then how: secret has A at position2? But position2 is already compared? And position5 is R? And also position1 is R? So for guess position3: A. Does secret have A and not matched? Yes, at positions2 and4? But position2 is not available? Then assign to position4? So yes, A is present? But in the wrong position? So it will be dash? But we had A(✓) for position3.

I'm confused. Let me do step by step for secret ""RADAR"" and guess ""crane"":

secret: R A D A R

guess: C R A N E

- Check positions one by one:
  Position1: C vs R -> no match.
  Position2: R vs A -> no match.
  Position3: A vs D -> no match.
  Position4: N vs A -> no match.
  Position5: E vs R -> no match.

Then, check for yellows:
  C: not in secret -> black/x
  R: in secret at positions1 and5? But since position2 doesn't match and R is not used, mark the second occurrence? How Wordle does it: usually, it processes first for greens, then yellows.

  Instead, standard is: first, mark all exact matches? None? Then mark present letters.

  secret positions: R(0),A(1),D(2),A(3),R(4) [indices 0-4]
  guess: C0: absent -> x
         R1: is in secret? at positions0 or4? But not at position1? Mark one R as present -> - Since we didn't use position0 or4 yet.
         A2: secret has A at positions1 and3. Mark one A as present -> - 
         N3: absent -> x
         E4: absent -> x

So then the feedback would be: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

But then we don't have any green? But we know A is at position3 of guess? But it can be matched with either A in secret? So not fixed.

However, in this case, we wouldn't have A(✓) anywhere? For position3 of guess? We got dash?

But in our first feedback, we had A(✓) for position3? Because in crabarba guess ""crane"", position3 is A and we had ✓. So we only had ✓ for A? That means there was an exact match.

Therefore, for ""crane"", the feedback was:
C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

So that means for the letter in position3 of the guess? It must have matched the secret at position3.

So secret has A at position3? Then why in the second guess for ""ratio"", when we put A in position2, we get dash? But that means secret doesn't have A at position2? But then how can the secret have A at position3 only? But then in ""crane"" we had A at position3 and it was ✓, meaning secret position3 is A.

And in ""ratio"", we put A at position2? If secret position2 is not A, then it might have A elsewhere? But then it should be marked dash if present elsewhere? And we left position3 to be I in ratio? Etc.

 So for ""ratio"":
R at position1: if secret has R but not at position1? Then dash.
A at position2: secret position2 is not A? But we already know from guess1 that secret position3 is A? So secret position2 is something else. But secret must have an A somewhere? Since it has A at position3. Then in ""ratio"", A at position2 is not correct, but A is in the word in position3, so it is present? So it should be dashed.

 So that's consistent.

 Therefore, from guess1: 
   Position3 of secret is A.  (because A at position3 in guess1 was ✓)
   R is in the secret (somewhere) but not in position2? Because in guess1 R was at position2 of guess? But secret position2 is not R? Because position2 might be unknown.

But wait, the feedback for guess1: 
  Position1: C? x
  Position2: R? - (present but wrong position)
  Position3: A? ✓  -> secret position3 is A
  Position4: N? x
  Position5: E? x

So secret has R, but not in position2? And secret has no C, N, E.

Then from guess2 ""ratio"":
  Position1: R? dash - so R is in the word but not at position1? But we know it's in the word.
  Position2: A? dash - so secret has A but not at position2? But we know secret has A? It is at position3? So A should be present elsewhere? So dash is correct because it is present but not at position2.
  Position3: T? x - absent
  Position4: I? x - absent
  Position5: O? x - absent

Therefore, the new information is:
- T, I, O are absent in the secret word.
- R is not in position1 (and we know from guess1 not in position2? And position3 is A? So secret positions: 
Position1: unknown (not C, N, E allowed; but must contain new letters)
Position2: unknown (not R, because in guess1 position2 had R and it was not present at position2? And not C,N,E; and now from guess2, not A? So not R and not A at position2? But A is in the word, but not at position2? Because feedback dash.
Position3: A (fixed)
Position4: unknown (not N,E,C as before, and also from this guess not T,I,O)
Position5: unknown (same as position4)

Additionally, R must be in the word. Since from guess1 we have R(-) and guess2 we have R(-) at position1, and can not be in position2? But position3 is taken by A? So R must be in position4 or position5.

Similarly, we know the secret word has:

- R at either position4 or position5? Because position1 is not available (we guessed R at position1 and got dash? It means R is not in position1? But that only confirms that position1 is not R? And position2 cannot be R because? We know from guess1 that position2 is not R? So only position4 or position5 remain? But position3 is A? So R must be at position4 or5.

Moreover, the secret word has exactly the two occurrences of letters we know? Or more? We know of R and A? But A is at position3? And R must be at position4 or5. But also we have feedback that A is present? But we already have A at position3? Why did they say dash for A in guess2? Because it's already used? Or not. In ""ratio"", we have one A at position2? Which does not match the secret's position2? And the secret has A at position3? Which is not used by the A in that guess? But then the algorithm for Wordle-type games is:

The secret has:
Position: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: ?, 5: ?
And we know secret contains R (at position4 or5) and does not contain C,N,E,T,I,O.

Now the feedback for A:

In guess2, we placed A at position2? Secret has no A at position2? But does secret have another A? We don't know? Currently we only know of one A at position3. So for Letter A: 
There is an A in the secret at position3. But when we guess A at position2, it is not the same A? So the position2 A in guess: 
Does not match secret's position2? And then we have one A in secret at position3? Not used yet? So we mark it as present? Hence the dash.

Yes, so that makes sense.

Summary:

Secret word: 
  Position1: some letter (not R, not A, not C, N, E, T, I, O)
  Position2: some letter (not R, not A, not C, N, E, T, I, O) 
  Position3: A (fixed)
  Position4: must be R or the letter at position4 is R? But also? Could be something else? We know R must be in the word, and it can only be in position4 or5? Because position1 not, position2 not (from guess1), position3 is held by A.

And position4 and5: one of them must be R? Or both? But we don't know duplicate.

Also, all except position3 are unknown letters? But we have constraints: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O. And also not R at positions1 and2? But position2 can be R? No, in guess1 we put R at position2 and it was dash? So secret position2 is not R. Because if it was R, we would have gotten a green R? But we got dash? That means secret has R, but not at that position.

So secret position2 is not R.

Therefore, the secret word has the following structure:

Let me denote:
Pos1: some letter (call it X)
Pos2: some letter (call it Y)
Pos3: A
Pos4: either let's say letter Z or R? 
Pos5: W or R? 
But either pos4 or pos5 is R? Or both could be R? But unknown.

But we know the letter at pos2 cannot be R? And pos1 cannot be R? And pos3 is A? So R must be at pos4 or pos5.

Also, we know there is only one A? Or there might be more? We know at least one? So far in our guesses, words have one A? But secret could have two? We don't know.

To be safe, we must only use the constraints from feedback.

So we have to guess a 5-letter word that:
- Doesn't contain C, N, E, T, I, O -> invalid letters now: C, N, E, T, I, O
- Contains R -> R must be in the word? And we know from feedback
- Has A in the word? But we already know position3 is A.

For the next guess, we need to test the other positions? Especially positions1,2,4,5.

But we also want to find where R is.

We can try to guess a word that has R in position4? Then if it's correct, we get green? Or if not, then it must be at position5.

At the same time, use other common letters for positions1 and2.

Available letters: not C,N,E,T,I,O? What are they? Let's see:
English alphabet minus the known absent: C, E, I, O, T? And N? So absent: C, E, I, O, T, N

Also, we know R and A are present? But A is already placed? So for other positions? R is not placed? So for new letters.

Common letters: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We want to test position4 and5 for R? So make our guess have R at position4 or5?

Also, position2 can be any letter except the invalid ones? And not R? Because if we put R at position2, we know it's not possible? But we won't do that.

So possible word: 
Pattern: _ _ A _ R 
So end with R at position5? With position4 also unknown? Or _A_R_? But position3 is fixed A.

We can think of words ending with R? Or having R at position4.

But also, the we need to test position2? Because we have no information about position2? Except that it is not R? And not A? Etc.

So we want to choose a word that has:

- Letter at position3: A (fixed)
- Have R in position4 or5? To test.
- Letters at positions1 and2 are common and not from the invalid set.

Let's list candidate words:

Ending with R: 
- Words like ____R with position3:A? So 3:A, 5:R.

What is position4? It can be anything? So _ _A # R? where # is a letter? For example, ""BAKER"" has E? Not allowed.

Since position5 is R? We must do XXXAR? Or YY A? R? But wait, position5 R.

The pattern: ? ? A ? R

For example: words: GUARD? Doesn't have A at position3? 
GUARD: G,U,A,R,D -> position3 is A? But A is at position3? Yes? 
GUARD: position1:G,2:U,3:A,4:R,5:D? So not R at position5? Let me count:

Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:R, 5:D? So if we want position5 to be R? That's not.

Words ending with ...AR? Position4:A, position3 it must be? We need a different structure.

For the pattern: position3:A, position5:R -> so the last two letters are ? R? But position4 is letter before R? So ending with "" R"" meaning two letters: then for example: ? ? A X R

 position1,2? A at position3 and R at position5? With position4 being some letter.

For example: 
- ""MAGAR"" is not a word? 
- ""JAGAR""? No

But we need English words.

Another: ""LARGO"", but O is invalid? 
""PAGER"" has E? Invalid.

What about ""SADAR""? Not a word.
 ""BAKAR""? Not English.

 ""HAZAR""? Not common.

Better to think with common letters? Use S, L, D, etc.

""G A L A R""? and then? Word: ""polar""? Position: 1:P,2:O,3:L,4:A,5:R? But O is invalid? And position3 is L not A?

So with A at position3 and R at position5? So we need the third letter to be A? So the word should be 1:?,2:?,3:A,4:?,5:R

Known words: 
- ""cigar"" has C? invalid.
- ""vicar"" has I? invalid.
- ""cedar"" has E,C? invalid.
- ""radar"" has R at position1? But we can put? ""radar"": R at position1? But we know position1 cannot be R? Because ""ratio"" had R at1 and got dash? And also ""radar"" has valid letters? R,A at other positions? But we know R is at position1, but we already know R is not at position1.

So ""radar"" would have position1 R -> but we know it's not R? So not then.

Other words: ""agar"" is 4-letter.

What about using 'S' at beginning: ""sa lar""? ""SAYAR""? Not a word.

""manar"" has M,A,N,A? N is invalid.

""capar"" has C.

So it's difficult? Maybe position4 is R? Then the structure: ? ? A R ?

For example, words that have ""AR"" at position3-4? And then position5 some letter.

Word: ""MARRY"" has two R's? Pos4 R and pos5 Y? Pattern: M A R R Y? But the A is at position2? We want A at position3? So not.

Word with A at position3 and R at position4: so ... A R ... like at positions 3 and4: ""AR"" and then position5 something.

For example:
- ""STAR "" : S T A R something? 5-letter: ""stark"": S,T,A,R,K -> position4 is R? So pattern: 1:S,2:T,3:A,4:R,5:K. This has S,T,K? T is now invalid? Because from guess2 we know T is absent? So ""stark"" uses T? Cannot.

Similarly, ""start"" uses T and T.
""chair"" uses C and I.

""hair"" ? ""HAIRY""?: H A I R Y -> position3 is I? Not A? Also uses I.

But we need position3 A? 

What about ""HAREM""? H A R E M? A at2? Not at3.

""aaron"" has O? invalid.

 Perhaps the secret word has R at position4? And position5 unknown? Or R at position5? But we haven't found many words.

Another possibility: there is a word that has R at position4? And let's accept that position5 is a common letter.

For example: ""AWAKE""? But E? invalid.

""BASTE"" has E? ""BASIL"" has I? ""BAGEL"" has E,G? ""RAGER"" has E? All invalid.

But we can restrict: the invalid letters are C,N,E,T,I,O? So valid letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? and we know R and A are present? But A is placed at position3 and R must be one other.

So for the word, the unknown positions1,2,4,5: must be from the valid letters.

 But also, we know position1 cannot be R? Position2 cannot be R? And position3 is A? R is at position4 or5.

Let us try to choose a word that has R at position4? If we put a word with R at position4, then:
- If R is at position4? We get check? If not, it will be dash if at position5.

Also, while testing other letters.

So word suggestion: let's pick ""SALAD""? But not: S A L A D? Position3 L? And doesn't have R? But R is required? So must include R.

Must have R? So guess a word that includes R.

For example: ""PULLAR""? Not 5 letters.

""RADII"" has R at1 and I? invalid.

""BARNY"" has R? But N and Y? N is invalid.

Perhaps accept that not all popular letters? We need to test R's position. So try a word that has R at position4? Or at5? Let's do position4 R.

So guess a word that has R at position4, and other letter common.

Example: ""sugar"": S U G A R? Wrong pattern? We need the third letter A? sugar: position1:S,2:U,3:G,4:A,5:R? But position3 is G not A? So we want position3 to be A? So we can do word with R at position4 and position3 A? So it includes "" A R"" at positions3-4? And then position1,2,5 are unknown.

English words: 
- ""LIAR ?""  5-letter: ""liard"": L I A R D, but I is invalid? And contains I? which we already know is absent.
- ""guard"": G U A R D -> position3 is A? position4 is R? position5:D? So the word is ""GUARD""? G U A R D.

Letters: G,U,A,R,D? A is at position3? And R at position4? Position5:D? 
Are the letters valid? 
 G: not in invalid set? 
 U: allowed?
 D: allowed
 R: at position4? 
 A: at position3? 

Invalid letters are C, N, E, T, I, O? So G,U,D and R,A are allowed? 

So ""guard"" seems a valid word.

Also, can we check uniqueness? But not necessary.

But we know R? So whether R is at position4? If so, we get a green R? If not, then since R must be in positions4 or5, then if R is at position5, then we will get red for R at position4? And yellow for R at position5? Or not? Wait.

For example, if secret has R at position5:
secret: ? ? A ? R
our guess: G U A R D
For position4: R vs secret position4? not R if secret position4 is something else? And secret position5 is R? 
Then feedback: 
Position1: G vs ? 
Position2: U vs secret position2
Position3: A vs secret A: match -> green
Position4: R vs secret what? The secret position4 is not R? So no match? But R is in secret? Since at position5? Then do we mark yellow? Yes.

If secret has R at position4: then position4: R is green.

So we can distinguish.

Therefore, ""guard"" is a good choice.

Another word? ""MARRY"" has A at position2? Not position3.

So ""guard"" is acceptable.

We can try with other common letters.

Alternative: ""HARSH?"" H A R S H? Position3 is R? Not A.

""PARER"" has E,P,A at2? Not position3.

But we select ""guard"".

But note: we have already used U? And D? We are looking to test.

So we'll guess ""guard"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""guard"".After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 ""crane"": 
  - A is confirmed in position 3 (✓), so the secret word has ""A"" as its third letter.
  - R is present but misplaced (-), so it must be in position 4 or 5 (not positions 1, 2, or 3 due to feedback constraints).
  - C, N, E are absent (x) and cannot be in the word.

- From Guess 2 ""ratio"":
  - R is still misplaced (-), confirming it cannot be in position 1 (as guessed here) or position 2 (from Guess 1). Combined with position 3 being fixed as ""A"", R must be in either position 4 or 5.
  - A is present but misplaced (-) again. Since position 3 is fixed as ""A"" from Guess 1, this dash likely indicates the position 3 ""A"" is the only one and was not reused, or it could imply multiple ""A""s, but the minimal conclusion is no additional ""A"" at position 2.
  - T, I, O are absent (x) and cannot be in the word.

**Constraints summary:**
- **Position 3 is A** (fixed).
- **R must be in position 4 or 5**.
- **Absent letters:** C, E, I, N, O, T (cannot appear).
- **Remaining positions:** Positions 1, 2, and (4 or 5) need to be guessed using valid letters.
- **Valid letters remaining:** B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).

**Strategy for this guess:**
- Test R in position 4 explicitly: If guessed as R and correct, feedback will show ✓; if misplaced but R is in the word, it may be at position 5.
- Use high-frequency valid letters (e.g., S, L, G, D) for positions 1 and 2 to maximize information.
- Avoid wasting positions on R in non-candidate slots or redundant testing of A.
- Word priority: ""guard"" tests R at position 4 and introduces / tests G, U, D:
  - Positions: G (1), U (2), A (3), R (4), D (5).
  - If R is in position 4, feedback will show ✓; otherwise, it will likely be misplaced (-), and position 5 must be R.
  - U and D are new, common letters to gather more feedback.

If ""guard"" is invalid or risky, alternatives like ""sugar"" or ""larnd"" are possible, but ""sugar"" places ""A"" incorrectly (position 4), and ""larnd"" uses ""L"" and ""D"" effectively—yet ""guard"" optimally targets R's placement.

Actually, in our guess, R was in the second position and it was misplaced. But note: the feedback for R is \'-\' meaning it is in the word, just not in that position. However, we don\'t know where it actually is. It could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, we know from the feedback that the secret word does not start with C (because C is absent), and the second letter is A. So the word has the form: _ A _ _ _\n\nNow, our next guess should try to test more letters and also position the known letters appropriately.\n\nConstraints:\n- Avoid C, N, E.\n- Must include R (somewhere except the second position? Actually, we can put R in any position except the second because we know it\'s not there? But wait: it\'s possible that R could appear multiple times? However, we don\'t have evidence of duplicates. Since the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates unless they are in the word multiple times, and we only have one R in ""crane"", we don\'t know. But typically, we assume no duplicates until we see evidence.\n\nHowever, note the feedback: for ""crane"", we got one R marked as present (misplaced) and the others absent. So the secret word has at least one R.\n\nWe also know the secret word has the letter A in the second position and doesn\'t have C, N, E.\n\nWe should focus on using other common letters and try to place R appropriately.\n\nPossible positions for R: since it cannot be in the second position, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: our guess ""crane"" had R in position 2, which was wrong. So R must be elsewhere, but we don\'t know which of the other positions.\n\nFor the next guess, we want to test R in a different position and also introduce new common letters.\n\nLet me think of a word that:\n- Second letter is A (fixed).\n- Includes R (somewhere except second position).\n- Does not contain C, N, E.\n- Includes other common letters (like S, T, L, etc.)\n\nCommon letters: we can try S, T, L, I, O, P, etc.\n\nExample words with second letter A and including R?\n\nLet\'s try some possibilities:\n\n- Start with R? e.g., words like: RAMPS, but we have to avoid N and E? Wait RAMPS: R (position1), A (position2), M (position3), P (position4), S (position5). But we don\'t know about M, P, S yet.\n\nBut note we can\'t use E, so avoid words ending in E? RAMPS avoids E.\n\nAlternatively: PARTY: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). This uses common letters and includes R in third position.\n\nBut we don\'t know if P, T, Y are present.\n\nAnother: BARDS? B(1),A(2),R(3),D(4),S(5). Avoids the forbidden letters.\n\nBut we have two unknowns: we have R and also B, D, S.\n\nHowever, we also want to cover more ground. Maybe choose a word with S, T, L? Since we know A and R are present, we can focus on other high-frequency letters.\n\nLet me think: we have the second letter fixed as A. We need R somewhere else. And we avoid C, N, E.\n\nLet\'s list some words that fit:\n- SMART: S(1), A(2), M(3), R(4), T(5). This includes S, M, T and R. But note: we already tried C? But here S and T are new.\n\nAlso, note: we are going to get feedback on each letter again.\n\nWe could also try to see if the first letter is known? We don\'t have any hint about the first letter except it cannot be C (because C is absent). So any letter except C and also not N, E (but since the first letter cannot be C, N, E? Actually, we know the word doesn\'t have N and E anywhere). So the first letter cannot be C, N, E? It can be any other letter except C, N, E? Actually, we know the word doesn\'t contain C, N, E at all. So the first letter must be from the remaining 23 letters.\n\nSo all letters in the word must avoid C, N, E.\n\nTherefore, SMART: letters S, A, M, R, T: none of which are C, N, E -> valid.\n\nBut we have R in the fourth position? Let me check the feedback: if we guess ""smart"", then:\n- S: new letter -> could be anywhere?\n- A: already in second position, so that should get a checkmark.\n- R: in fourth position. We know from our previous feedback that R is in the word but not in the second position. We don\'t know about the fourth position.\n\nWe might get more information.\n\nAlternatively, another word: TARES? But E is forbidden? Oh, TARES has E? So avoid since E is absent? Our feedback says E is not in the word, so TARES has E -> invalid.\n\nAnother word: PARTY: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). This avoids C, N, E.\n\nSimilarly, we could consider: BARKS: but K? and S? And B is new.\n\nBut let me go with SMART because it has common letters S, M, T and R, and we get A again in the second position which we know is fixed. And we test R in the fourth position.\n\nBut note: in our previous guess, R was in position 2 and was wrong. Now we put R in position 4. If R is actually in position 1, 3, or 5, then putting it in 4 will get a \'-\' or even a checkmark? We don\'t know.\n\nHowever, we are trying to gather more information.\n\nAnother idea: we know the word has R and A in the second position. We can try a word with R in the first position to test that. Because if R is in first, then we might get a checkmark.\n\nSo words like: R A _ _ _ \nBut no C, N, E.\n\nExamples: RAPID? But we don\'t know if P, I, D are present? and we avoid E.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t used any of R, A in other positions? Actually, A is fixed in second.\n\nSo R A ? ? ? \n\nPossible words: RALLY? but L and Y and L? Letters: R, A, L, L -> but duplicates? We avoid duplicates? Actually, we can have duplicates? But we don\'t know. However, we have no information. But RALLY has two L\'s? We should avoid for now? Maybe choose without duplicates.\n\nRANKS? but we know N is absent -> invalid because N is not in the word? RANKS contains N -> invalid.\n\nRACER? contains C and E -> invalid.\n\nSo what about: RATIO? but contains T and I and O? and avoids C,N,E? Yes.\n\nRATIO: R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). This tests R in position 1. And we test T, I, O.\n\nBut note: we already have A in the second position, so that part is safe.\n\nSo RATIO might be a good guess? Because it tests R at position one and adds common letters T, I, O.\n\nAlternatively, we could try RABID? but B and I? and D? RABID: R(1),A(2),B(3),I(4),D(5). Avoids C,N,E.\n\nBut T and O might be more common? Actually, from letter frequency, E is most common but absent, then T, A, O, I, N (which is absent), S, etc. So T, O, I, S are good.\n\nTherefore, RATIO is a good candidate.\n\nAnother: PARTS? P,A,R,T,S -> that\'s five distinct? P(1),A(2),R(3),T(4),S(5). This places R in the third position? And we avoid the second position? Yes.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested the positions close to the beginning? But RATIO tests position 1 for R.\n\nI think testing R at position 1 is a good idea because if it\'s correct we get a checkmark, and if it\'s not, we know it must be in 3,4,5? Wait, we know it\'s not in position 2.\n\nSo let me choose RATIO.\n\nBut another consideration: we already know that the secret word does not contain C, N, E. And we are trying to find the position of R.\n\nI\'ll go with RATIO because it uses R in first position and common letters T, I, O.\n\nSo my next guess is ""ratio"".\n\nBut wait: what about the feedback? In our previous guess, we had ""crane"" and got R as misplaced. Now when we put R in first position, we might get:\n- If R is the first letter, then ✓\n- If R is not in the first, but is present, then \'-\' (and then we know R is not in position1 either)\n- Or worst, if R is not present? but it must be because we got a \'-\' in the first guess? So it must be present.\n\nSo we\'ll either get R with ✓ or with \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly for A: we know it\'s in the second position, so it should always be ✓.\n\nSo without loss, we can get feedback on the new letters.\n\nTherefore, let\'s guess ""ratio"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is absent (x) → not in the secret word\n- R is present but misplaced (-) → in the secret word, not in position 2\n- A is correct and in position (✓) → second letter is A\n- N is absent (x) → not in the secret word\n- E is absent (x) → not in the secret word\n\nConstraints derived:\n- The secret word has the form _ A _ _ _\n- Must contain R (somewhere except position 2)\n- Cannot contain C, N, E\n- Letters to prioritize for new information: common consonants (e.g., T, S, L, D) and vowels (e.g., I, O, U)\n\nStrategy for this guess:\n- Include R in a new position (position 1 is tested here to quickly validate/invalidate it as a starting letter)\n- Retain A in position 2 (since it\'s confirmed)\n- Avoid C, N, E entirely\n- Introduce new high-frequency letters (T, I, O) to maximize feedback information\n- Choose a word that fits: ""ratio"" meets these criteria (R in position 1, A in position 2, and testing T, I, O)\n\nIf R is in position 1, we may receive a ✓ for R, confirming its position. If R is misplaced again, we narrow its possible locations to positions 3–5. Feedback on T, I, and O will further reduce possibilities.\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C: x (absent)\n- R: - (present but wrong position)\n- A: ✓ (correct and in the second position, so the secret word has A as the second letter)\n- N: x (absent)\n- E: x (absent)\n\nSecond guess: ""ratio""\n- R: - (present but wrong position)\n- A: - (present but wrong position)  → This is critical! Previously A was in the correct position (second), but now in ""ratio"", A is in the second position again but getting a dash (-). This seems contradictory.\n\nWait, let me check the second guess feedback:\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n\nBut in the secret word, we know from the first guess that A is in the second position. However, in this second guess, we put A in the second position again, and now the feedback says A is present but in the wrong position? That cannot be because if A is fixed in the second position, then putting A in second should always give a check.\n\nUnless... the secret word has more than one A? Because if the secret word has two A\'s, then one of them is in the correct position (second), but if we put an A in the second position again, it might not be marked as correct? Actually, no, the feedback rules:\n\nThe usual Wordle rule: \n- If a letter is correct and in the right position, it gets a ✓, regardless of duplicates?\n- However, if there is only one A in the secret word, and it\'s in the second position, then when we put A in the second position we should get ✓ always.\n\nBut here we got A(-) meaning present but wrong position? That implies that in the secret word, A is not in the second position? But that contradicts the first feedback.\n\nWait, the first feedback: for ""crane"", we had A(✓) in the second position. That means the second letter of the secret word is A. So when we guess ""ratio"", which has A in the second position, we should again get ✓ for A.\n\nBut we got A(-) for A? This is inconsistent unless the game changed? Or I misunderstood.\n\nPossible explanation: \n- The secret word has exactly one A? Then the A in second position should be always check when guessed there. So getting dash is impossible if it was correct previously.\n\nWait, unless the feedback for ""ratio"" is entered incorrectly? Or perhaps I misunderstood the feedback format.\n\nLooking back at the user input: ""Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)""\n\nThis feedback says A is present but in the wrong position? So what does that mean for the second letter?\n\nBut we know from guess 1: the second letter is A. So if in guess 2 we also have A in second, it must be correct? Unless... there is a bug? Or perhaps it\'s an encoding?\n\nAnother possibility: the secret word has two As? So in the first guess, one of the A\'s was in the correct position? Actually, ""crane"" has only one A? So that A is the only one and it was in the correct position? Then it should be fixed.\n\nBut then in the second guess, we put A in second position again -> must be check.\n\nBut the feedback says dash? This does not make sense logically.\n\nUnless we are misinterpreting the feedback? The feedback is for each letter:\n\nFor ""ratio"":\n- R(1): - → present but wrong position? \n- A(2): - → present but wrong position? But position 2? \n- T(3): x → absent\n- I(4): x → absent\n- O(5): x → absent\n\nBut note: if the secret word has A in position 2, then A(2) in ""ratio"" must be check.\n\nSo this feedback indicates that A is NOT in the second position? Then that contradicts the first guess where we had A(✓) for position 2.\n\nNow I see the problem. The alternative explanation:\n\nIn the first guess, ""crane"" with A(✓) means A is correct and in position 2.\n\nBut in the second guess, we did ""ratio"" and for A(2) we get ""-"", meaning that the letter A is in the word but not in the position we guessed? However, since we guessed it in position 2 again, it must mean that the A we discovered is not in position 2? That can\'t be because we already know it is.\n\nUnless the secret word is not fixed? Or there\'s a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps we should consider duplicate letters? But ""crane"" had one A and ""ratio"" has one A.\n\nPossible error: the game might have been reset? But no, the user says ""make a new guess"" and provides previous feedback.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the feedback for the second guess is relative to the secret word ignoring previous interactions? But that would be foolish.\n\nActually, for ""ratio"", the A in second position must be correct? Because it was already fixed. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement.\n\nBut let\'s think differently. What if the first feedback was misinterpreted? For ""crane"", the feedback was C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x). So A was marked ✓, meaning it\'s correct in that position? So it\'s fixed.\n\nBut then for the same position in a new guess to be dash suggests that we are mistaken? Or it could be a system error.\n\nBut perhaps we should assume that the feedback is correct? Then we must reconsider the implication.\n\nThe only logical explanation is that the secret word has at least two A\'s? Because:\n- In the first guess ""crane"", the A in position 2 was correct (so one A is at position 2).\n- In the second guess ""ratio"", the A in position 2 is the same one? So why dash? Unless: the secret word has two A\'s? And in the second guess, if the secret word has A also in another position? But no.\n\nActually, the feedback in Wordle handles duplicates? Let me recall: typically, if the secret word has duplicate letters, then we must provide the same number of letters? So if the secret word has two A\'s and you guess a word with one A, and that A is in the correct position? The other A remains? But I\'m confused.\n\nExample from real Wordle? Let me think of an example:\n\nSuppose secret word: APPLE? And we guess CRANE:\nC R A N E → APPLE: \nC: absent → x\nR: absent (since APPLE doesn\'t have R) → but wait? In our case R was marked dash? So that\'s different.\n\nAnother example: secret word: BALSA? But let\'s try:\n\nSecret: BALSA\n\nGuess: crane → \nc: x (no C)\nr: (BALSA has no R) → x? But in our first guess we had R(-) so secret must have R.\nSo impossible.\n\nAnother idea: secret word has the second letter not A? But then why did we get A(✓) for position 2 in ""crane""?\n\nUnless... maybe during the first guess, when we had A(✓) it meant that the letter A is in the word and in position 2? So it must be.\n\nBut then why is it dash in the second guess?\n\nUnless the game is not standard Wordle? Maybe the feedback doesn\'t take into account duplicated letters? For instance, if the secret word has a repeated letter? But let\'s assume that.\n\nScenario: the secret word has two A\'s? For example, SECRET: A was in position 2 and also in position 5? For example, word ""PANDA""? But we know from first feedback: R(-), A(✓), and no N, no E, no C? PANDA: PANDA? First guess: crane → \nC: x\nR: (PANDA has no R?) so x? But we had R(-) so PANDA cannot be? Because it has no R.\n\nWhat about ""RADAR""? But RADAR has two A\'s and one R.\n\nFirst guess: crane → RADAR? \nC: absent → x\nR: first letter? We put R in position2 in ""crane""? \ncrane: position1:C,2:R,3:A,4:N,5:E.\n secret word: RADAR: R, A, D, A, R\n\nSo:\nC: x (absent)\nR: in position2? Secret has R in position1 and position5? What happens?\nWordle rule: for R in ""crane"" at position2: \nSecret has R at position1 and position5.\nBut for position2 in guess, we are comparing to secret\'s position2? Which is A? So letter R doesn\'t match. But then it looks for R elsewhere: there is R at position1 and position5. Since position1 is not used yet? Then R at position2 in guess is not in the word at that position? But it is present? So it should be marked as present (dash) because there is an R that is not used? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, at position3: A in guess and secret position2 is A? That matches? So check? Wait:\n\nPosition1 guess C vs secret R: R isn\'t used? Later.\nPosition2 guess R vs secret A: not matching -> but there is R in the secret, so mark as present? So dash.\nPosition3 guess A vs secret D? D vs A? not match? Then how: secret has A at position2? But position2 is already compared? And position5 is R? And also position1 is R? So for guess position3: A. Does secret have A and not matched? Yes, at positions2 and4? But position2 is not available? Then assign to position4? So yes, A is present? But in the wrong position? So it will be dash? But we had A(✓) for position3.\n\nI\'m confused. Let me do step by step for secret ""RADAR"" and guess ""crane"":\n\nsecret: R A D A R\n\nguess: C R A N E\n\n- Check positions one by one:\n  Position1: C vs R -> no match.\n  Position2: R vs A -> no match.\n  Position3: A vs D -> no match.\n  Position4: N vs A -> no match.\n  Position5: E vs R -> no match.\n\nThen, check for yellows:\n  C: not in secret -> black/x\n  R: in secret at positions1 and5? But since position2 doesn\'t match and R is not used, mark the second occurrence? How Wordle does it: usually, it processes first for greens, then yellows.\n\n  Instead, standard is: first, mark all exact matches? None? Then mark present letters.\n\n  secret positions: R(0),A(1),D(2),A(3),R(4) [indices 0-4]\n  guess: C0: absent -> x\n         R1: is in secret? at positions0 or4? But not at position1? Mark one R as present -> - Since we didn\'t use position0 or4 yet.\n         A2: secret has A at positions1 and3. Mark one A as present -> - \n         N3: absent -> x\n         E4: absent -> x\n\nSo then the feedback would be: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n\nBut then we don\'t have any green? But we know A is at position3 of guess? But it can be matched with either A in secret? So not fixed.\n\nHowever, in this case, we wouldn\'t have A(✓) anywhere? For position3 of guess? We got dash?\n\nBut in our first feedback, we had A(✓) for position3? Because in crabarba guess ""crane"", position3 is A and we had ✓. So we only had ✓ for A? That means there was an exact match.\n\nTherefore, for ""crane"", the feedback was:\nC(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)\n\nSo that means for the letter in position3 of the guess? It must have matched the secret at position3.\n\nSo secret has A at position3? Then why in the second guess for ""ratio"", when we put A in position2, we get dash? But that means secret doesn\'t have A at position2? But then how can the secret have A at position3 only? But then in ""crane"" we had A at position3 and it was ✓, meaning secret position3 is A.\n\nAnd in ""ratio"", we put A at position2? If secret position2 is not A, then it might have A elsewhere? But then it should be marked dash if present elsewhere? And we left position3 to be I in ratio? Etc.\n\n So for ""ratio"":\nR at position1: if secret has R but not at position1? Then dash.\nA at position2: secret position2 is not A? But we already know from guess1 that secret position3 is A? So secret position2 is something else. But secret must have an A somewhere? Since it has A at position3. Then in ""ratio"", A at position2 is not correct, but A is in the word in position3, so it is present? So it should be dashed.\n\n So that\'s consistent.\n\n Therefore, from guess1: \n   Position3 of secret is A.  (because A at position3 in guess1 was ✓)\n   R is in the secret (somewhere) but not in position2? Because in guess1 R was at position2 of guess? But secret position2 is not R? Because position2 might be unknown.\n\nBut wait, the feedback for guess1: \n  Position1: C? x\n  Position2: R? - (present but wrong position)\n  Position3: A? ✓  -> secret position3 is A\n  Position4: N? x\n  Position5: E? x\n\nSo secret has R, but not in position2? And secret has no C, N, E.\n\nThen from guess2 ""ratio"":\n  Position1: R? dash - so R is in the word but not at position1? But we know it\'s in the word.\n  Position2: A? dash - so secret has A but not at position2? But we know secret has A? It is at position3? So A should be present elsewhere? So dash is correct because it is present but not at position2.\n  Position3: T? x - absent\n  Position4: I? x - absent\n  Position5: O? x - absent\n\nTherefore, the new information is:\n- T, I, O are absent in the secret word.\n- R is not in position1 (and we know from guess1 not in position2? And position3 is A? So secret positions: \nPosition1: unknown (not C, N, E allowed; but must contain new letters)\nPosition2: unknown (not R, because in guess1 position2 had R and it was not present at position2? And not C,N,E; and now from guess2, not A? So not R and not A at position2? But A is in the word, but not at position2? Because feedback dash.\nPosition3: A (fixed)\nPosition4: unknown (not N,E,C as before, and also from this guess not T,I,O)\nPosition5: unknown (same as position4)\n\nAdditionally, R must be in the word. Since from guess1 we have R(-) and guess2 we have R(-) at position1, and can not be in position2? But position3 is taken by A? So R must be in position4 or position5.\n\nSimilarly, we know the secret word has:\n\n- R at either position4 or position5? Because position1 is not available (we guessed R at position1 and got dash? It means R is not in position1? But that only confirms that position1 is not R? And position2 cannot be R because? We know from guess1 that position2 is not R? So only position4 or position5 remain? But position3 is A? So R must be at position4 or5.\n\nMoreover, the secret word has exactly the two occurrences of letters we know? Or more? We know of R and A? But A is at position3? And R must be at position4 or5. But also we have feedback that A is present? But we already have A at position3? Why did they say dash for A in guess2? Because it\'s already used? Or not. In ""ratio"", we have one A at position2? Which does not match the secret\'s position2? And the secret has A at position3? Which is not used by the A in that guess? But then the algorithm for Wordle-type games is:\n\nThe secret has:\nPosition: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: ?, 5: ?\nAnd we know secret contains R (at position4 or5) and does not contain C,N,E,T,I,O.\n\nNow the feedback for A:\n\nIn guess2, we placed A at position2? Secret has no A at position2? But does secret have another A? We don\'t know? Currently we only know of one A at position3. So for Letter A: \nThere is an A in the secret at position3. But when we guess A at position2, it is not the same A? So the position2 A in guess: \nDoes not match secret\'s position2? And then we have one A in secret at position3? Not used yet? So we mark it as present? Hence the dash.\n\nYes, so that makes sense.\n\nSummary:\n\nSecret word: \n  Position1: some letter (not R, not A, not C, N, E, T, I, O)\n  Position2: some letter (not R, not A, not C, N, E, T, I, O) \n  Position3: A (fixed)\n  Position4: must be R or the letter at position4 is R? But also? Could be something else? We know R must be in the word, and it can only be in position4 or5? Because position1 not, position2 not (from guess1), position3 is held by A.\n\nAnd position4 and5: one of them must be R? Or both? But we don\'t know duplicate.\n\nAlso, all except position3 are unknown letters? But we have constraints: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O. And also not R at positions1 and2? But position2 can be R? No, in guess1 we put R at position2 and it was dash? So secret position2 is not R. Because if it was R, we would have gotten a green R? But we got dash? That means secret has R, but not at that position.\n\nSo secret position2 is not R.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the following structure:\n\nLet me denote:\nPos1: some letter (call it X)\nPos2: some letter (call it Y)\nPos3: A\nPos4: either let\'s say letter Z or R? \nPos5: W or R? \nBut either pos4 or pos5 is R? Or both could be R? But unknown.\n\nBut we know the letter at pos2 cannot be R? And pos1 cannot be R? And pos3 is A? So R must be at pos4 or pos5.\n\nAlso, we know there is only one A? Or there might be more? We know at least one? So far in our guesses, words have one A? But secret could have two? We don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, we must only use the constraints from feedback.\n\nSo we have to guess a 5-letter word that:\n- Doesn\'t contain C, N, E, T, I, O -> invalid letters now: C, N, E, T, I, O\n- Contains R -> R must be in the word? And we know from feedback\n- Has A in the word? But we already know position3 is A.\n\nFor the next guess, we need to test the other positions? Especially positions1,2,4,5.\n\nBut we also want to find where R is.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has R in position4? Then if it\'s correct, we get green? Or if not, then it must be at position5.\n\nAt the same time, use other common letters for positions1 and2.\n\nAvailable letters: not C,N,E,T,I,O? What are they? Let\'s see:\nEnglish alphabet minus the known absent: C, E, I, O, T? And N? So absent: C, E, I, O, T, N\n\nAlso, we know R and A are present? But A is already placed? So for other positions? R is not placed? So for new letters.\n\nCommon letters: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe want to test position4 and5 for R? So make our guess have R at position4 or5?\n\nAlso, position2 can be any letter except the invalid ones? And not R? Because if we put R at position2, we know it\'s not possible? But we won\'t do that.\n\nSo possible word: \nPattern: _ _ A _ R \nSo end with R at position5? With position4 also unknown? Or _A_R_? But position3 is fixed A.\n\nWe can think of words ending with R? Or having R at position4.\n\nBut also, the we need to test position2? Because we have no information about position2? Except that it is not R? And not A? Etc.\n\nSo we want to choose a word that has:\n\n- Letter at position3: A (fixed)\n- Have R in position4 or5? To test.\n- Letters at positions1 and2 are common and not from the invalid set.\n\nLet\'s list candidate words:\n\nEnding with R: \n- Words like ____R with position3:A? So 3:A, 5:R.\n\nWhat is position4? It can be anything? So _ _A # R? where # is a letter? For example, ""BAKER"" has E? Not allowed.\n\nSince position5 is R? We must do XXXAR? Or YY A? R? But wait, position5 R.\n\nThe pattern: ? ? A ? R\n\nFor example: words: GUARD? Doesn\'t have A at position3? \nGUARD: G,U,A,R,D -> position3 is A? But A is at position3? Yes? \nGUARD: position1:G,2:U,3:A,4:R,5:D? So not R at position5? Let me count:\n\nPosition: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:R, 5:D? So if we want position5 to be R? That\'s not.\n\nWords ending with ...AR? Position4:A, position3 it must be? We need a different structure.\n\nFor the pattern: position3:A, position5:R -> so the last two letters are ? R? But position4 is letter before R? So ending with "" R"" meaning two letters: then for example: ? ? A X R\n\n position1,2? A at position3 and R at position5? With position4 being some letter.\n\nFor example: \n- ""MAGAR"" is not a word? \n- ""JAGAR""? No\n\nBut we need English words.\n\nAnother: ""LARGO"", but O is invalid? \n""PAGER"" has E? Invalid.\n\nWhat about ""SADAR""? Not a word.\n ""BAKAR""? Not English.\n\n ""HAZAR""? Not common.\n\nBetter to think with common letters? Use S, L, D, etc.\n\n""G A L A R""? and then? Word: ""polar""? Position: 1:P,2:O,3:L,4:A,5:R? But O is invalid? And position3 is L not A?\n\nSo with A at position3 and R at position5? So we need the third letter to be A? So the word should be 1:?,2:?,3:A,4:?,5:R\n\nKnown words: \n- ""cigar"" has C? invalid.\n- ""vicar"" has I? invalid.\n- ""cedar"" has E,C? invalid.\n- ""radar"" has R at position1? But we can put? ""radar"": R at position1? But we know position1 cannot be R? Because ""ratio"" had R at1 and got dash? And also ""radar"" has valid letters? R,A at other positions? But we know R is at position1, but we already know R is not at position1.\n\nSo ""radar"" would have position1 R -> but we know it\'s not R? So not then.\n\nOther words: ""agar"" is 4-letter.\n\nWhat about using \'S\' at beginning: ""sa lar""? ""SAYAR""? Not a word.\n\n""manar"" has M,A,N,A? N is invalid.\n\n""capar"" has C.\n\nSo it\'s difficult? Maybe position4 is R? Then the structure: ? ? A R ?\n\nFor example, words that have ""AR"" at position3-4? And then position5 some letter.\n\nWord: ""MARRY"" has two R\'s? Pos4 R and pos5 Y? Pattern: M A R R Y? But the A is at position2? We want A at position3? So not.\n\nWord with A at position3 and R at position4: so ... A R ... like at positions 3 and4: ""AR"" and then position5 something.\n\nFor example:\n- ""STAR "" : S T A R something? 5-letter: ""stark"": S,T,A,R,K -> position4 is R? So pattern: 1:S,2:T,3:A,4:R,5:K. This has S,T,K? T is now invalid? Because from guess2 we know T is absent? So ""stark"" uses T? Cannot.\n\nSimilarly, ""start"" uses T and T.\n""chair"" uses C and I.\n\n""hair"" ? ""HAIRY""?: H A I R Y -> position3 is I? Not A? Also uses I.\n\nBut we need position3 A? \n\nWhat about ""HAREM""? H A R E M? A at2? Not at3.\n\n""aaron"" has O? invalid.\n\n Perhaps the secret word has R at position4? And position5 unknown? Or R at position5? But we haven\'t found many words.\n\nAnother possibility: there is a word that has R at position4? And let\'s accept that position5 is a common letter.\n\nFor example: ""AWAKE""? But E? invalid.\n\n""BASTE"" has E? ""BASIL"" has I? ""BAGEL"" has E,G? ""RAGER"" has E? All invalid.\n\nBut we can restrict: the invalid letters are C,N,E,T,I,O? So valid letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? and we know R and A are present? But A is placed at position3 and R must be one other.\n\nSo for the word, the unknown positions1,2,4,5: must be from the valid letters.\n\n But also, we know position1 cannot be R? Position2 cannot be R? And position3 is A? R is at position4 or5.\n\nLet us try to choose a word that has R at position4? If we put a word with R at position4, then:\n- If R is at position4? We get check? If not, it will be dash if at position5.\n\nAlso, while testing other letters.\n\nSo word suggestion: let\'s pick ""SALAD""? But not: S A L A D? Position3 L? And doesn\'t have R? But R is required? So must include R.\n\nMust have R? So guess a word that includes R.\n\nFor example: ""PULLAR""? Not 5 letters.\n\n""RADII"" has R at1 and I? invalid.\n\n""BARNY"" has R? But N and Y? N is invalid.\n\nPerhaps accept that not all popular letters? We need to test R\'s position. So try a word that has R at position4? Or at5? Let\'s do position4 R.\n\nSo guess a word that has R at position4, and other letter common.\n\nExample: ""sugar"": S U G A R? Wrong pattern? We need the third letter A? sugar: position1:S,2:U,3:G,4:A,5:R? But position3 is G not A? So we want position3 to be A? So we can do word with R at position4 and position3 A? So it includes "" A R"" at positions3-4? And then position1,2,5 are unknown.\n\nEnglish words: \n- ""LIAR ?""  5-letter: ""liard"": L I A R D, but I is invalid? And contains I? which we already know is absent.\n- ""guard"": G U A R D -> position3 is A? position4 is R? position5:D? So the word is ""GUARD""? G U A R D.\n\nLetters: G,U,A,R,D? A is at position3? And R at position4? Position5:D? \nAre the letters valid? \n G: not in invalid set? \n U: allowed?\n D: allowed\n R: at position4? \n A: at position3? \n\nInvalid letters are C, N, E, T, I, O? So G,U,D and R,A are allowed? \n\nSo ""guard"" seems a valid word.\n\nAlso, can we check uniqueness? But not necessary.\n\nBut we know R? So whether R is at position4? If so, we get a green R? If not, then since R must be in positions4 or5, then if R is at position5, then we will get red for R at position4? And yellow for R at position5? Or not? Wait.\n\nFor example, if secret has R at position5:\nsecret: ? ? A ? R\nour guess: G U A R D\nFor position4: R vs secret position4? not R if secret position4 is something else? And secret position5 is R? \nThen feedback: \nPosition1: G vs ? \nPosition2: U vs secret position2\nPosition3: A vs secret A: match -> green\nPosition4: R vs secret what? The secret position4 is not R? So no match? But R is in secret? Since at position5? Then do we mark yellow? Yes.\n\nIf secret has R at position4: then position4: R is green.\n\nSo we can distinguish.\n\nTherefore, ""guard"" is a good choice.\n\nAnother word? ""MARRY"" has A at position2? Not position3.\n\nSo ""guard"" is acceptable.\n\nWe can try with other common letters.\n\nAlternative: ""HARSH?"" H A R S H? Position3 is R? Not A.\n\n""PARER"" has E,P,A at2? Not position3.\n\nBut we select ""guard"".\n\nBut note: we have already used U? And D? We are looking to test.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""guard"".\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""guard"".After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- From Guess 1 ""crane"": \n  - A is confirmed in position 3 (✓), so the secret word has ""A"" as its third letter.\n  - R is present but misplaced (-), so it must be in position 4 or 5 (not positions 1, 2, or 3 due to feedback constraints).\n  - C, N, E are absent (x) and cannot be in the word.\n\n- From Guess 2 ""ratio"":\n  - R is still misplaced (-), confirming it cannot be in position 1 (as guessed here) or position 2 (from Guess 1). Combined with position 3 being fixed as ""A"", R must be in either position 4 or 5.\n  - A is present but misplaced (-) again. Since position 3 is fixed as ""A"" from Guess 1, this dash likely indicates the position 3 ""A"" is the only one and was not reused, or it could imply multiple ""A""s, but the minimal conclusion is no additional ""A"" at position 2.\n  - T, I, O are absent (x) and cannot be in the word.\n\n**Constraints summary:**\n- **Position 3 is A** (fixed).\n- **R must be in position 4 or 5**.\n- **Absent letters:** C, E, I, N, O, T (cannot appear).\n- **Remaining positions:** Positions 1, 2, and (4 or 5) need to be guessed using valid letters.\n- **Valid letters remaining:** B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).\n\n**Strategy for this guess:**\n- Test R in position 4 explicitly: If guessed as R and correct, feedback will show ✓; if misplaced but R is in the word, it may be at position 5.\n- Use high-frequency valid letters (e.g., S, L, G, D) for positions 1 and 2 to maximize information.\n- Avoid wasting positions on R in non-candidate slots or redundant testing of A.\n- Word priority: ""guard"" tests R at position 4 and introduces / tests G, U, D:\n  - Positions: G (1), U (2), A (3), R (4), D (5).\n  - If R is in position 4, feedback will show ✓; otherwise, it will likely be misplaced (-), and position 5 must be R.\n  - U and D are new, common letters to gather more feedback.\n\nIf ""guard"" is invalid or risky, alternatives like ""sugar"" or ""larnd"" are possible, but ""sugar"" places ""A"" incorrectly (position 4), and ""larnd"" uses ""L"" and ""D"" effectively—yet ""guard"" optimally targets R\'s placement.\n\n<guess>guard</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: guard -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""guard"":
  G: x -> absent
  U: x -> absent
  A: ✓ -> correct position (position 3, as expected)
  R: ✓ -> correct position (so position 4 is R)
  D: ✓ -> correct position (so position 5 is D)

Therefore, we now know:
- Position 3: A (already known)
- Position 4: R (new)
- Position 5: D (new)

Also, from the feedback, G and U are absent, so we add them to the invalid letters.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ _ A R D

We also know the following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, G, U (from previous feedback)

And we know the word must contain R and A (already placed) and D (placed).

Now, we need to find the first two letters.

Constraints for positions 1 and 2:
- Must be letters that are not in the invalid set: C, E, I, O, T, N, G, U (and also not A, R, D? But they are already placed, so we can use them again? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates? But the word has A, R, D already? So positions 1 and 2 must be different from A, R, D? Because if they were the same, we would have duplicates? But we don't know.

But from the feedback of ""guard"": 
  We had A, R, D in positions 3,4,5 and they were all correct? So if the secret word had, say, an A in position1, then in ""guard"" we only have one A? So it would not be marked? But we didn't test position1 and2? So we don't know.

But to be safe, we should avoid using A, R, D in positions1 and2? Because if they are not in the word again, we get an absent? But we don't know.

Actually, we have to consider the possibility of duplicates? But we haven't encountered any duplicate feedback? So we assume no duplicates? Or we can test.

But to minimize risk, we can avoid using A, R, D in positions1 and2? Because they are already in the word? So if the secret word has no duplicates, then we avoid incorrect letters? But if it has duplicates, we might miss? But we have no information.

Given the feedback, we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume the secret word has no duplicates? Then positions1 and2 must be letters that are not A, R, D and not in the invalid set.

Invalid letters: C, E, I, O, T, N, G, U

So available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a word of the form: ? ? A R D

Common words: 
- BOARD: but O is invalid? and we have O absent? So not.
- HEARD: H E A R D -> but E is invalid? So not.
- LARDY: L A R D Y -> but A is at position2? We need A at position3? So not.
- We need the third letter to be A? So the word must end with ""ARD"".

So words like: 
- S?ARD: e.g., ""sward"", ""shard"", ""guard"" we already tried? ""guard"" is tried? But we tried ""guard"" and it had G,U which are absent? But we are looking for the first two letters.

""shard"": S H A R D -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:D? But we have A,R,D at 3,4,5? So if we guess ""shard"", then we test S and H.

Similarly, ""chard"" has C? invalid.

""board"" has O? invalid.

""heard"" has E? invalid.

""mardy"" is not common? and M A R D Y? A at position2? Not.

So ""shard"" is a candidate: S H A R D.

Also, ""spard""? Not a word.

""stard"" not a word.

""ward"" is 4-letter.

So ""shard"" is a valid word? Yes.

Another: ""bards"" but S at the end? But we need D at the end? ""bards"" is B A R D S? So A at position2? Not.

We need the last three to be A R D? So the first two can be any valid letters? But must form a word.

Other words: 
- ""hardy"" is H A R D Y? A at position2? Not.
- ""lardy"" same.

So ""shard"" is one.

""jardy""? Not a word.

""mardy"" is a word? M A R D Y? Again A at position2? Not.

So we need the third letter to be A? So the word must be of the form: [letter][letter] A R D

So the first two letters? We can have:

- SH as in ""shard""
- Or perhaps ""board"" but O invalid? 
- ""guard"" we tried? But it had G and U? 
- ""award"": A W A R D? But A at position1? And we have A at position3? So if we guess ""award"", then position1: A? But we don't know if A is duplicated? But we have A at position3? So if the secret word has only one A? Then position1 A would be absent? But we don't know.

But we can try? But we have to avoid invalid letters.

""award"": A W A R D? Letters: A, W, A, R, D? But we know W is not invalid? But we have two A's? 

But the secret word has A at position3? So if we guess ""award"", then:
- Position1: A? If secret has no A at position1? Then it would be marked absent? But we know A is in the word? So it would be marked as present? But in the wrong position? But the secret has A at position3? So if we put A at position1? It should be marked as present? But not at position1? So dash? 

But we want to test position1 and2? So we can do that.

But we also have the possibility to use ""shard"".

But let's list possible words: 
- ""shard"": S H A R D
- ""award"": A W A R D
- ""lard"" is 4-letter? 
- ""mard"" is not 5? 
- ""pardy""? Not a word.

""shard"" uses S and H? Both are valid? And we haven't tested them? So we can get feedback on S and H.

Similarly, ""award"" uses A and W? But A is already known? So we test W? But we also test if there is a duplicate A? But we don't know.

But we have limited guesses? So we should avoid using known letters? Because we want to test new letters? So ""shard"" is better? Because it tests two new letters: S and H.

But note: we have position1 and2 to be S and H? And we know the rest.

So we can guess ""shard"".

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicates? But we have no evidence? So we assume no duplicates? Then ""shard"" is a good guess.

If we guess ""shard"", and if S and H are correct? Then we get all green? If not, we get feedback.

But we have only two positions left? So we can also try a word that uses more common letters? But we have to use the pattern.

Another word: ""sward"": S W A R D? W is valid? So ""sward"" is a word? Meaning a grassy area? So we can test S and W.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""shard"" is fine.

But let's see the feedback from ""guard"": we got G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)? So the secret word is ? ? A R D.

Now, we know the last three are A R D? So the word ends with ""ARD"".

We need to find the first two letters? From the available letters.

We can also consider: ""bards"" is not? Because it ends with S? Not D.

So I think ""shard"" is a good candidate.

Therefore, we guess ""shard"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**  
  - A is in position 3 (✓), R is present but misplaced (-), and C, N, E are absent (x).

- **Guess 2: ""ratio"" → Feedback: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)**  
  - R is still misplaced (-) and not in position 1, A is present but not in position 2 (misplaced, -), and T, I, O are absent (x).

- **Guess 3: ""guard"" → Feedback: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)**  
  - A (position 3), R (position 4), and D (position 5) are correct (✓), while G and U are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 3: **A** (confirmed in all guesses).  
   - Position 4: **R** (✓ in ""guard"").  
   - Position 5: **D** (✓ in ""guard"").  
   - The secret word has the form: `_ _ A R D`.

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, E, I, N, O, T (from Guess 1 and 2).  
   - G, U (from Guess 3).  
   - **Total absent**: C, E, G, I, N, O, T, U. These cannot appear anywhere.

3. **Present Letters**:  
   - Only A, R, and D are confirmed present, but they are already correctly placed (positions 3–5).  
   - No other letters are known to be present yet.

4. **Remaining Unknowns**:  
   - Positions 1 and 2 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.  
   - Valid letters for positions 1 and 2: **B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
   - No duplicates are indicated in feedback, so we assume no duplicates (A, R, D cannot reappear in positions 1–2).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- The secret word ends with ""ARD"" (positions 3–5). We need to guess the first two letters.  
- Prioritize high-frequency valid letters (e.g., S, L, H, P) to maximize information.  
- Test ""shard"" as a candidate:  
  - **S** in position 1 and **H** in position 2.  
  - Both are common letters not yet tested.  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on S and H will narrow possibilities (e.g., if S is absent, we eliminate many words like ""shard"", ""sward"", etc.).  
- Alternatives like ""award"" or ""sward"" were considered, but ""award"" wastes a position testing A (already known) and ""sward"" uses W (less common than H). ""shard"" is optimal.

<guess>shard</guess>",shard,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""guard"":
  G: x -> absent
  U: x -> absent
  A: ✓ -> correct position (position 3, as expected)
  R: ✓ -> correct position (so position 4 is R)
  D: ✓ -> correct position (so position 5 is D)

Therefore, we now know:
- Position 3: A (already known)
- Position 4: R (new)
- Position 5: D (new)

Also, from the feedback, G and U are absent, so we add them to the invalid letters.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ _ A R D

We also know the following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, G, U (from previous feedback)

And we know the word must contain R and A (already placed) and D (placed).

Now, we need to find the first two letters.

Constraints for positions 1 and 2:
- Must be letters that are not in the invalid set: C, E, I, O, T, N, G, U (and also not A, R, D? But they are already placed, so we can use them again? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates? But the word has A, R, D already? So positions 1 and 2 must be different from A, R, D? Because if they were the same, we would have duplicates? But we don't know.

But from the feedback of ""guard"": 
  We had A, R, D in positions 3,4,5 and they were all correct? So if the secret word had, say, an A in position1, then in ""guard"" we only have one A? So it would not be marked? But we didn't test position1 and2? So we don't know.

But to be safe, we should avoid using A, R, D in positions1 and2? Because if they are not in the word again, we get an absent? But we don't know.

Actually, we have to consider the possibility of duplicates? But we haven't encountered any duplicate feedback? So we assume no duplicates? Or we can test.

But to minimize risk, we can avoid using A, R, D in positions1 and2? Because they are already in the word? So if the secret word has no duplicates, then we avoid incorrect letters? But if it has duplicates, we might miss? But we have no information.

Given the feedback, we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume the secret word has no duplicates? Then positions1 and2 must be letters that are not A, R, D and not in the invalid set.

Invalid letters: C, E, I, O, T, N, G, U

So available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a word of the form: ? ? A R D

Common words: 
- BOARD: but O is invalid? and we have O absent? So not.
- HEARD: H E A R D -> but E is invalid? So not.
- LARDY: L A R D Y -> but A is at position2? We need A at position3? So not.
- We need the third letter to be A? So the word must end with ""ARD"".

So words like: 
- S?ARD: e.g., ""sward"", ""shard"", ""guard"" we already tried? ""guard"" is tried? But we tried ""guard"" and it had G,U which are absent? But we are looking for the first two letters.

""shard"": S H A R D -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:D? But we have A,R,D at 3,4,5? So if we guess ""shard"", then we test S and H.

Similarly, ""chard"" has C? invalid.

""board"" has O? invalid.

""heard"" has E? invalid.

""mardy"" is not common? and M A R D Y? A at position2? Not.

So ""shard"" is a candidate: S H A R D.

Also, ""spard""? Not a word.

""stard"" not a word.

""ward"" is 4-letter.

So ""shard"" is a valid word? Yes.

Another: ""bards"" but S at the end? But we need D at the end? ""bards"" is B A R D S? So A at position2? Not.

We need the last three to be A R D? So the first two can be any valid letters? But must form a word.

Other words: 
- ""hardy"" is H A R D Y? A at position2? Not.
- ""lardy"" same.

So ""shard"" is one.

""jardy""? Not a word.

""mardy"" is a word? M A R D Y? Again A at position2? Not.

So we need the third letter to be A? So the word must be of the form: [letter][letter] A R D

So the first two letters? We can have:

- SH as in ""shard""
- Or perhaps ""board"" but O invalid? 
- ""guard"" we tried? But it had G and U? 
- ""award"": A W A R D? But A at position1? And we have A at position3? So if we guess ""award"", then position1: A? But we don't know if A is duplicated? But we have A at position3? So if the secret word has only one A? Then position1 A would be absent? But we don't know.

But we can try? But we have to avoid invalid letters.

""award"": A W A R D? Letters: A, W, A, R, D? But we know W is not invalid? But we have two A's? 

But the secret word has A at position3? So if we guess ""award"", then:
- Position1: A? If secret has no A at position1? Then it would be marked absent? But we know A is in the word? So it would be marked as present? But in the wrong position? But the secret has A at position3? So if we put A at position1? It should be marked as present? But not at position1? So dash? 

But we want to test position1 and2? So we can do that.

But we also have the possibility to use ""shard"".

But let's list possible words: 
- ""shard"": S H A R D
- ""award"": A W A R D
- ""lard"" is 4-letter? 
- ""mard"" is not 5? 
- ""pardy""? Not a word.

""shard"" uses S and H? Both are valid? And we haven't tested them? So we can get feedback on S and H.

Similarly, ""award"" uses A and W? But A is already known? So we test W? But we also test if there is a duplicate A? But we don't know.

But we have limited guesses? So we should avoid using known letters? Because we want to test new letters? So ""shard"" is better? Because it tests two new letters: S and H.

But note: we have position1 and2 to be S and H? And we know the rest.

So we can guess ""shard"".

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicates? But we have no evidence? So we assume no duplicates? Then ""shard"" is a good guess.

If we guess ""shard"", and if S and H are correct? Then we get all green? If not, we get feedback.

But we have only two positions left? So we can also try a word that uses more common letters? But we have to use the pattern.

Another word: ""sward"": S W A R D? W is valid? So ""sward"" is a word? Meaning a grassy area? So we can test S and W.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""shard"" is fine.

But let's see the feedback from ""guard"": we got G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)? So the secret word is ? ? A R D.

Now, we know the last three are A R D? So the word ends with ""ARD"".

We need to find the first two letters? From the available letters.

We can also consider: ""bards"" is not? Because it ends with S? Not D.

So I think ""shard"" is a good candidate.

Therefore, we guess ""shard"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,award,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has five distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x -> not in the secret word
  R: - -> in the secret word but not in the first position
  A: ✓ -> correct position (so the second letter of the secret word is A)
  N: x -> not in the secret word
  E: x -> not in the secret word

So we know:
- The secret word has the letter R, but not in the second position (because R was in the first guess's second position and got '-', meaning it's in the word but misplaced).
- The second letter of the secret word is A (because A got a checkmark in the second position).
- The letters C, N, and E are not in the secret word.

Also, we know that the secret word does not contain C, N, E.

We must form a new 5-letter word that:
- Has the letter A in the second position (since it's confirmed there).
- Includes the letter R (because we know it's present) but not in the second position? Actually, in our guess, R was in the second position and it was misplaced. But note: the feedback for R is '-' meaning it is in the word, just not in that position. However, we don't know where it actually is. It could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

Also, we know from the feedback that the secret word does not start with C (because C is absent), and the second letter is A. So the word has the form: _ A _ _ _

Now, our next guess should try to test more letters and also position the known letters appropriately.

Constraints:
- Avoid C, N, E.
- Must include R (somewhere except the second position? Actually, we can put R in any position except the second because we know it's not there? But wait: it's possible that R could appear multiple times? However, we don't have evidence of duplicates. Since the feedback doesn't show duplicates unless they are in the word multiple times, and we only have one R in ""crane"", we don't know. But typically, we assume no duplicates until we see evidence.

However, note the feedback: for ""crane"", we got one R marked as present (misplaced) and the others absent. So the secret word has at least one R.

We also know the secret word has the letter A in the second position and doesn't have C, N, E.

We should focus on using other common letters and try to place R appropriately.

Possible positions for R: since it cannot be in the second position, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.

But note: our guess ""crane"" had R in position 2, which was wrong. So R must be elsewhere, but we don't know which of the other positions.

For the next guess, we want to test R in a different position and also introduce new common letters.

Let me think of a word that:
- Second letter is A (fixed).
- Includes R (somewhere except second position).
- Does not contain C, N, E.
- Includes other common letters (like S, T, L, etc.)

Common letters: we can try S, T, L, I, O, P, etc.

Example words with second letter A and including R?

Let's try some possibilities:

- Start with R? e.g., words like: RAMPS, but we have to avoid N and E? Wait RAMPS: R (position1), A (position2), M (position3), P (position4), S (position5). But we don't know about M, P, S yet.

But note we can't use E, so avoid words ending in E? RAMPS avoids E.

Alternatively: PARTY: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). This uses common letters and includes R in third position.

But we don't know if P, T, Y are present.

Another: BARDS? B(1),A(2),R(3),D(4),S(5). Avoids the forbidden letters.

But we have two unknowns: we have R and also B, D, S.

However, we also want to cover more ground. Maybe choose a word with S, T, L? Since we know A and R are present, we can focus on other high-frequency letters.

Let me think: we have the second letter fixed as A. We need R somewhere else. And we avoid C, N, E.

Let's list some words that fit:
- SMART: S(1), A(2), M(3), R(4), T(5). This includes S, M, T and R. But note: we already tried C? But here S and T are new.

Also, note: we are going to get feedback on each letter again.

We could also try to see if the first letter is known? We don't have any hint about the first letter except it cannot be C (because C is absent). So any letter except C and also not N, E (but since the first letter cannot be C, N, E? Actually, we know the word doesn't have N and E anywhere). So the first letter cannot be C, N, E? It can be any other letter except C, N, E? Actually, we know the word doesn't contain C, N, E at all. So the first letter must be from the remaining 23 letters.

So all letters in the word must avoid C, N, E.

Therefore, SMART: letters S, A, M, R, T: none of which are C, N, E -> valid.

But we have R in the fourth position? Let me check the feedback: if we guess ""smart"", then:
- S: new letter -> could be anywhere?
- A: already in second position, so that should get a checkmark.
- R: in fourth position. We know from our previous feedback that R is in the word but not in the second position. We don't know about the fourth position.

We might get more information.

Alternatively, another word: TARES? But E is forbidden? Oh, TARES has E? So avoid since E is absent? Our feedback says E is not in the word, so TARES has E -> invalid.

Another word: PARTY: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). This avoids C, N, E.

Similarly, we could consider: BARKS: but K? and S? And B is new.

But let me go with SMART because it has common letters S, M, T and R, and we get A again in the second position which we know is fixed. And we test R in the fourth position.

But note: in our previous guess, R was in position 2 and was wrong. Now we put R in position 4. If R is actually in position 1, 3, or 5, then putting it in 4 will get a '-' or even a checkmark? We don't know.

However, we are trying to gather more information.

Another idea: we know the word has R and A in the second position. We can try a word with R in the first position to test that. Because if R is in first, then we might get a checkmark.

So words like: R A _ _ _ 
But no C, N, E.

Examples: RAPID? But we don't know if P, I, D are present? and we avoid E.

But note: we haven't used any of R, A in other positions? Actually, A is fixed in second.

So R A ? ? ? 

Possible words: RALLY? but L and Y and L? Letters: R, A, L, L -> but duplicates? We avoid duplicates? Actually, we can have duplicates? But we don't know. However, we have no information. But RALLY has two L's? We should avoid for now? Maybe choose without duplicates.

RANKS? but we know N is absent -> invalid because N is not in the word? RANKS contains N -> invalid.

RACER? contains C and E -> invalid.

So what about: RATIO? but contains T and I and O? and avoids C,N,E? Yes.

RATIO: R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). This tests R in position 1. And we test T, I, O.

But note: we already have A in the second position, so that part is safe.

So RATIO might be a good guess? Because it tests R at position one and adds common letters T, I, O.

Alternatively, we could try RABID? but B and I? and D? RABID: R(1),A(2),B(3),I(4),D(5). Avoids C,N,E.

But T and O might be more common? Actually, from letter frequency, E is most common but absent, then T, A, O, I, N (which is absent), S, etc. So T, O, I, S are good.

Therefore, RATIO is a good candidate.

Another: PARTS? P,A,R,T,S -> that's five distinct? P(1),A(2),R(3),T(4),S(5). This places R in the third position? And we avoid the second position? Yes.

But note: we haven't tested the positions close to the beginning? But RATIO tests position 1 for R.

I think testing R at position 1 is a good idea because if it's correct we get a checkmark, and if it's not, we know it must be in 3,4,5? Wait, we know it's not in position 2.

So let me choose RATIO.

But another consideration: we already know that the secret word does not contain C, N, E. And we are trying to find the position of R.

I'll go with RATIO because it uses R in first position and common letters T, I, O.

So my next guess is ""ratio"".

But wait: what about the feedback? In our previous guess, we had ""crane"" and got R as misplaced. Now when we put R in first position, we might get:
- If R is the first letter, then ✓
- If R is not in the first, but is present, then '-' (and then we know R is not in position1 either)
- Or worst, if R is not present? but it must be because we got a '-' in the first guess? So it must be present.

So we'll either get R with ✓ or with '-'.

Similarly for A: we know it's in the second position, so it should always be ✓.

So without loss, we can get feedback on the new letters.

Therefore, let's guess ""ratio"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is absent (x) → not in the secret word
- R is present but misplaced (-) → in the secret word, not in position 2
- A is correct and in position (✓) → second letter is A
- N is absent (x) → not in the secret word
- E is absent (x) → not in the secret word

Constraints derived:
- The secret word has the form _ A _ _ _
- Must contain R (somewhere except position 2)
- Cannot contain C, N, E
- Letters to prioritize for new information: common consonants (e.g., T, S, L, D) and vowels (e.g., I, O, U)

Strategy for this guess:
- Include R in a new position (position 1 is tested here to quickly validate/invalidate it as a starting letter)
- Retain A in position 2 (since it's confirmed)
- Avoid C, N, E entirely
- Introduce new high-frequency letters (T, I, O) to maximize feedback information
- Choose a word that fits: ""ratio"" meets these criteria (R in position 1, A in position 2, and testing T, I, O)

If R is in position 1, we may receive a ✓ for R, confirming its position. If R is misplaced again, we narrow its possible locations to positions 3–5. Feedback on T, I, and O will further reduce possibilities.

<guess>ratio</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from two guesses:

First guess: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: - (present but wrong position)
- A: ✓ (correct and in the second position, so the secret word has A as the second letter)
- N: x (absent)
- E: x (absent)

Second guess: ""ratio""
- R: - (present but wrong position)
- A: - (present but wrong position)  → This is critical! Previously A was in the correct position (second), but now in ""ratio"", A is in the second position again but getting a dash (-). This seems contradictory.

Wait, let me check the second guess feedback:
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)

But in the secret word, we know from the first guess that A is in the second position. However, in this second guess, we put A in the second position again, and now the feedback says A is present but in the wrong position? That cannot be because if A is fixed in the second position, then putting A in second should always give a check.

Unless... the secret word has more than one A? Because if the secret word has two A's, then one of them is in the correct position (second), but if we put an A in the second position again, it might not be marked as correct? Actually, no, the feedback rules:

The usual Wordle rule: 
- If a letter is correct and in the right position, it gets a ✓, regardless of duplicates?
- However, if there is only one A in the secret word, and it's in the second position, then when we put A in the second position we should get ✓ always.

But here we got A(-) meaning present but wrong position? That implies that in the secret word, A is not in the second position? But that contradicts the first feedback.

Wait, the first feedback: for ""crane"", we had A(✓) in the second position. That means the second letter of the secret word is A. So when we guess ""ratio"", which has A in the second position, we should again get ✓ for A.

But we got A(-) for A? This is inconsistent unless the game changed? Or I misunderstood.

Possible explanation: 
- The secret word has exactly one A? Then the A in second position should be always check when guessed there. So getting dash is impossible if it was correct previously.

Wait, unless the feedback for ""ratio"" is entered incorrectly? Or perhaps I misunderstood the feedback format.

Looking back at the user input: ""Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)""

This feedback says A is present but in the wrong position? So what does that mean for the second letter?

But we know from guess 1: the second letter is A. So if in guess 2 we also have A in second, it must be correct? Unless... there is a bug? Or perhaps it's an encoding?

Another possibility: the secret word has two As? So in the first guess, one of the A's was in the correct position? Actually, ""crane"" has only one A? So that A is the only one and it was in the correct position? Then it should be fixed.

But then in the second guess, we put A in second position again -> must be check.

But the feedback says dash? This does not make sense logically.

Unless we are misinterpreting the feedback? The feedback is for each letter:

For ""ratio"":
- R(1): - → present but wrong position? 
- A(2): - → present but wrong position? But position 2? 
- T(3): x → absent
- I(4): x → absent
- O(5): x → absent

But note: if the secret word has A in position 2, then A(2) in ""ratio"" must be check.

So this feedback indicates that A is NOT in the second position? Then that contradicts the first guess where we had A(✓) for position 2.

Now I see the problem. The alternative explanation:

In the first guess, ""crane"" with A(✓) means A is correct and in position 2.

But in the second guess, we did ""ratio"" and for A(2) we get ""-"", meaning that the letter A is in the word but not in the position we guessed? However, since we guessed it in position 2 again, it must mean that the A we discovered is not in position 2? That can't be because we already know it is.

Unless the secret word is not fixed? Or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps we should consider duplicate letters? But ""crane"" had one A and ""ratio"" has one A.

Possible error: the game might have been reset? But no, the user says ""make a new guess"" and provides previous feedback.

Another thought: maybe the feedback for the second guess is relative to the secret word ignoring previous interactions? But that would be foolish.

Actually, for ""ratio"", the A in second position must be correct? Because it was already fixed. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement.

But let's think differently. What if the first feedback was misinterpreted? For ""crane"", the feedback was C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x). So A was marked ✓, meaning it's correct in that position? So it's fixed.

But then for the same position in a new guess to be dash suggests that we are mistaken? Or it could be a system error.

But perhaps we should assume that the feedback is correct? Then we must reconsider the implication.

The only logical explanation is that the secret word has at least two A's? Because:
- In the first guess ""crane"", the A in position 2 was correct (so one A is at position 2).
- In the second guess ""ratio"", the A in position 2 is the same one? So why dash? Unless: the secret word has two A's? And in the second guess, if the secret word has A also in another position? But no.

Actually, the feedback in Wordle handles duplicates? Let me recall: typically, if the secret word has duplicate letters, then we must provide the same number of letters? So if the secret word has two A's and you guess a word with one A, and that A is in the correct position? The other A remains? But I'm confused.

Example from real Wordle? Let me think of an example:

Suppose secret word: APPLE? And we guess CRANE:
C R A N E → APPLE: 
C: absent → x
R: absent (since APPLE doesn't have R) → but wait? In our case R was marked dash? So that's different.

Another example: secret word: BALSA? But let's try:

Secret: BALSA

Guess: crane → 
c: x (no C)
r: (BALSA has no R) → x? But in our first guess we had R(-) so secret must have R.
So impossible.

Another idea: secret word has the second letter not A? But then why did we get A(✓) for position 2 in ""crane""?

Unless... maybe during the first guess, when we had A(✓) it meant that the letter A is in the word and in position 2? So it must be.

But then why is it dash in the second guess?

Unless the game is not standard Wordle? Maybe the feedback doesn't take into account duplicated letters? For instance, if the secret word has a repeated letter? But let's assume that.

Scenario: the secret word has two A's? For example, SECRET: A was in position 2 and also in position 5? For example, word ""PANDA""? But we know from first feedback: R(-), A(✓), and no N, no E, no C? PANDA: PANDA? First guess: crane → 
C: x
R: (PANDA has no R?) so x? But we had R(-) so PANDA cannot be? Because it has no R.

What about ""RADAR""? But RADAR has two A's and one R.

First guess: crane → RADAR? 
C: absent → x
R: first letter? We put R in position2 in ""crane""? 
crane: position1:C,2:R,3:A,4:N,5:E.
 secret word: RADAR: R, A, D, A, R

So:
C: x (absent)
R: in position2? Secret has R in position1 and position5? What happens?
Wordle rule: for R in ""crane"" at position2: 
Secret has R at position1 and position5.
But for position2 in guess, we are comparing to secret's position2? Which is A? So letter R doesn't match. But then it looks for R elsewhere: there is R at position1 and position5. Since position1 is not used yet? Then R at position2 in guess is not in the word at that position? But it is present? So it should be marked as present (dash) because there is an R that is not used? Yes.

Similarly, at position3: A in guess and secret position2 is A? That matches? So check? Wait:

Position1 guess C vs secret R: R isn't used? Later.
Position2 guess R vs secret A: not matching -> but there is R in the secret, so mark as present? So dash.
Position3 guess A vs secret D? D vs A? not match? Then how: secret has A at position2? But position2 is already compared? And position5 is R? And also position1 is R? So for guess position3: A. Does secret have A and not matched? Yes, at positions2 and4? But position2 is not available? Then assign to position4? So yes, A is present? But in the wrong position? So it will be dash? But we had A(✓) for position3.

I'm confused. Let me do step by step for secret ""RADAR"" and guess ""crane"":

secret: R A D A R

guess: C R A N E

- Check positions one by one:
  Position1: C vs R -> no match.
  Position2: R vs A -> no match.
  Position3: A vs D -> no match.
  Position4: N vs A -> no match.
  Position5: E vs R -> no match.

Then, check for yellows:
  C: not in secret -> black/x
  R: in secret at positions1 and5? But since position2 doesn't match and R is not used, mark the second occurrence? How Wordle does it: usually, it processes first for greens, then yellows.

  Instead, standard is: first, mark all exact matches? None? Then mark present letters.

  secret positions: R(0),A(1),D(2),A(3),R(4) [indices 0-4]
  guess: C0: absent -> x
         R1: is in secret? at positions0 or4? But not at position1? Mark one R as present -> - Since we didn't use position0 or4 yet.
         A2: secret has A at positions1 and3. Mark one A as present -> - 
         N3: absent -> x
         E4: absent -> x

So then the feedback would be: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)

But then we don't have any green? But we know A is at position3 of guess? But it can be matched with either A in secret? So not fixed.

However, in this case, we wouldn't have A(✓) anywhere? For position3 of guess? We got dash?

But in our first feedback, we had A(✓) for position3? Because in crabarba guess ""crane"", position3 is A and we had ✓. So we only had ✓ for A? That means there was an exact match.

Therefore, for ""crane"", the feedback was:
C(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)

So that means for the letter in position3 of the guess? It must have matched the secret at position3.

So secret has A at position3? Then why in the second guess for ""ratio"", when we put A in position2, we get dash? But that means secret doesn't have A at position2? But then how can the secret have A at position3 only? But then in ""crane"" we had A at position3 and it was ✓, meaning secret position3 is A.

And in ""ratio"", we put A at position2? If secret position2 is not A, then it might have A elsewhere? But then it should be marked dash if present elsewhere? And we left position3 to be I in ratio? Etc.

 So for ""ratio"":
R at position1: if secret has R but not at position1? Then dash.
A at position2: secret position2 is not A? But we already know from guess1 that secret position3 is A? So secret position2 is something else. But secret must have an A somewhere? Since it has A at position3. Then in ""ratio"", A at position2 is not correct, but A is in the word in position3, so it is present? So it should be dashed.

 So that's consistent.

 Therefore, from guess1: 
   Position3 of secret is A.  (because A at position3 in guess1 was ✓)
   R is in the secret (somewhere) but not in position2? Because in guess1 R was at position2 of guess? But secret position2 is not R? Because position2 might be unknown.

But wait, the feedback for guess1: 
  Position1: C? x
  Position2: R? - (present but wrong position)
  Position3: A? ✓  -> secret position3 is A
  Position4: N? x
  Position5: E? x

So secret has R, but not in position2? And secret has no C, N, E.

Then from guess2 ""ratio"":
  Position1: R? dash - so R is in the word but not at position1? But we know it's in the word.
  Position2: A? dash - so secret has A but not at position2? But we know secret has A? It is at position3? So A should be present elsewhere? So dash is correct because it is present but not at position2.
  Position3: T? x - absent
  Position4: I? x - absent
  Position5: O? x - absent

Therefore, the new information is:
- T, I, O are absent in the secret word.
- R is not in position1 (and we know from guess1 not in position2? And position3 is A? So secret positions: 
Position1: unknown (not C, N, E allowed; but must contain new letters)
Position2: unknown (not R, because in guess1 position2 had R and it was not present at position2? And not C,N,E; and now from guess2, not A? So not R and not A at position2? But A is in the word, but not at position2? Because feedback dash.
Position3: A (fixed)
Position4: unknown (not N,E,C as before, and also from this guess not T,I,O)
Position5: unknown (same as position4)

Additionally, R must be in the word. Since from guess1 we have R(-) and guess2 we have R(-) at position1, and can not be in position2? But position3 is taken by A? So R must be in position4 or position5.

Similarly, we know the secret word has:

- R at either position4 or position5? Because position1 is not available (we guessed R at position1 and got dash? It means R is not in position1? But that only confirms that position1 is not R? And position2 cannot be R because? We know from guess1 that position2 is not R? So only position4 or position5 remain? But position3 is A? So R must be at position4 or5.

Moreover, the secret word has exactly the two occurrences of letters we know? Or more? We know of R and A? But A is at position3? And R must be at position4 or5. But also we have feedback that A is present? But we already have A at position3? Why did they say dash for A in guess2? Because it's already used? Or not. In ""ratio"", we have one A at position2? Which does not match the secret's position2? And the secret has A at position3? Which is not used by the A in that guess? But then the algorithm for Wordle-type games is:

The secret has:
Position: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: ?, 5: ?
And we know secret contains R (at position4 or5) and does not contain C,N,E,T,I,O.

Now the feedback for A:

In guess2, we placed A at position2? Secret has no A at position2? But does secret have another A? We don't know? Currently we only know of one A at position3. So for Letter A: 
There is an A in the secret at position3. But when we guess A at position2, it is not the same A? So the position2 A in guess: 
Does not match secret's position2? And then we have one A in secret at position3? Not used yet? So we mark it as present? Hence the dash.

Yes, so that makes sense.

Summary:

Secret word: 
  Position1: some letter (not R, not A, not C, N, E, T, I, O)
  Position2: some letter (not R, not A, not C, N, E, T, I, O) 
  Position3: A (fixed)
  Position4: must be R or the letter at position4 is R? But also? Could be something else? We know R must be in the word, and it can only be in position4 or5? Because position1 not, position2 not (from guess1), position3 is held by A.

And position4 and5: one of them must be R? Or both? But we don't know duplicate.

Also, all except position3 are unknown letters? But we have constraints: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O. And also not R at positions1 and2? But position2 can be R? No, in guess1 we put R at position2 and it was dash? So secret position2 is not R. Because if it was R, we would have gotten a green R? But we got dash? That means secret has R, but not at that position.

So secret position2 is not R.

Therefore, the secret word has the following structure:

Let me denote:
Pos1: some letter (call it X)
Pos2: some letter (call it Y)
Pos3: A
Pos4: either let's say letter Z or R? 
Pos5: W or R? 
But either pos4 or pos5 is R? Or both could be R? But unknown.

But we know the letter at pos2 cannot be R? And pos1 cannot be R? And pos3 is A? So R must be at pos4 or pos5.

Also, we know there is only one A? Or there might be more? We know at least one? So far in our guesses, words have one A? But secret could have two? We don't know.

To be safe, we must only use the constraints from feedback.

So we have to guess a 5-letter word that:
- Doesn't contain C, N, E, T, I, O -> invalid letters now: C, N, E, T, I, O
- Contains R -> R must be in the word? And we know from feedback
- Has A in the word? But we already know position3 is A.

For the next guess, we need to test the other positions? Especially positions1,2,4,5.

But we also want to find where R is.

We can try to guess a word that has R in position4? Then if it's correct, we get green? Or if not, then it must be at position5.

At the same time, use other common letters for positions1 and2.

Available letters: not C,N,E,T,I,O? What are they? Let's see:
English alphabet minus the known absent: C, E, I, O, T? And N? So absent: C, E, I, O, T, N

Also, we know R and A are present? But A is already placed? So for other positions? R is not placed? So for new letters.

Common letters: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

We want to test position4 and5 for R? So make our guess have R at position4 or5?

Also, position2 can be any letter except the invalid ones? And not R? Because if we put R at position2, we know it's not possible? But we won't do that.

So possible word: 
Pattern: _ _ A _ R 
So end with R at position5? With position4 also unknown? Or _A_R_? But position3 is fixed A.

We can think of words ending with R? Or having R at position4.

But also, the we need to test position2? Because we have no information about position2? Except that it is not R? And not A? Etc.

So we want to choose a word that has:

- Letter at position3: A (fixed)
- Have R in position4 or5? To test.
- Letters at positions1 and2 are common and not from the invalid set.

Let's list candidate words:

Ending with R: 
- Words like ____R with position3:A? So 3:A, 5:R.

What is position4? It can be anything? So _ _A # R? where # is a letter? For example, ""BAKER"" has E? Not allowed.

Since position5 is R? We must do XXXAR? Or YY A? R? But wait, position5 R.

The pattern: ? ? A ? R

For example: words: GUARD? Doesn't have A at position3? 
GUARD: G,U,A,R,D -> position3 is A? But A is at position3? Yes? 
GUARD: position1:G,2:U,3:A,4:R,5:D? So not R at position5? Let me count:

Position: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:R, 5:D? So if we want position5 to be R? That's not.

Words ending with ...AR? Position4:A, position3 it must be? We need a different structure.

For the pattern: position3:A, position5:R -> so the last two letters are ? R? But position4 is letter before R? So ending with "" R"" meaning two letters: then for example: ? ? A X R

 position1,2? A at position3 and R at position5? With position4 being some letter.

For example: 
- ""MAGAR"" is not a word? 
- ""JAGAR""? No

But we need English words.

Another: ""LARGO"", but O is invalid? 
""PAGER"" has E? Invalid.

What about ""SADAR""? Not a word.
 ""BAKAR""? Not English.

 ""HAZAR""? Not common.

Better to think with common letters? Use S, L, D, etc.

""G A L A R""? and then? Word: ""polar""? Position: 1:P,2:O,3:L,4:A,5:R? But O is invalid? And position3 is L not A?

So with A at position3 and R at position5? So we need the third letter to be A? So the word should be 1:?,2:?,3:A,4:?,5:R

Known words: 
- ""cigar"" has C? invalid.
- ""vicar"" has I? invalid.
- ""cedar"" has E,C? invalid.
- ""radar"" has R at position1? But we can put? ""radar"": R at position1? But we know position1 cannot be R? Because ""ratio"" had R at1 and got dash? And also ""radar"" has valid letters? R,A at other positions? But we know R is at position1, but we already know R is not at position1.

So ""radar"" would have position1 R -> but we know it's not R? So not then.

Other words: ""agar"" is 4-letter.

What about using 'S' at beginning: ""sa lar""? ""SAYAR""? Not a word.

""manar"" has M,A,N,A? N is invalid.

""capar"" has C.

So it's difficult? Maybe position4 is R? Then the structure: ? ? A R ?

For example, words that have ""AR"" at position3-4? And then position5 some letter.

Word: ""MARRY"" has two R's? Pos4 R and pos5 Y? Pattern: M A R R Y? But the A is at position2? We want A at position3? So not.

Word with A at position3 and R at position4: so ... A R ... like at positions 3 and4: ""AR"" and then position5 something.

For example:
- ""STAR "" : S T A R something? 5-letter: ""stark"": S,T,A,R,K -> position4 is R? So pattern: 1:S,2:T,3:A,4:R,5:K. This has S,T,K? T is now invalid? Because from guess2 we know T is absent? So ""stark"" uses T? Cannot.

Similarly, ""start"" uses T and T.
""chair"" uses C and I.

""hair"" ? ""HAIRY""?: H A I R Y -> position3 is I? Not A? Also uses I.

But we need position3 A? 

What about ""HAREM""? H A R E M? A at2? Not at3.

""aaron"" has O? invalid.

 Perhaps the secret word has R at position4? And position5 unknown? Or R at position5? But we haven't found many words.

Another possibility: there is a word that has R at position4? And let's accept that position5 is a common letter.

For example: ""AWAKE""? But E? invalid.

""BASTE"" has E? ""BASIL"" has I? ""BAGEL"" has E,G? ""RAGER"" has E? All invalid.

But we can restrict: the invalid letters are C,N,E,T,I,O? So valid letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? and we know R and A are present? But A is placed at position3 and R must be one other.

So for the word, the unknown positions1,2,4,5: must be from the valid letters.

 But also, we know position1 cannot be R? Position2 cannot be R? And position3 is A? R is at position4 or5.

Let us try to choose a word that has R at position4? If we put a word with R at position4, then:
- If R is at position4? We get check? If not, it will be dash if at position5.

Also, while testing other letters.

So word suggestion: let's pick ""SALAD""? But not: S A L A D? Position3 L? And doesn't have R? But R is required? So must include R.

Must have R? So guess a word that includes R.

For example: ""PULLAR""? Not 5 letters.

""RADII"" has R at1 and I? invalid.

""BARNY"" has R? But N and Y? N is invalid.

Perhaps accept that not all popular letters? We need to test R's position. So try a word that has R at position4? Or at5? Let's do position4 R.

So guess a word that has R at position4, and other letter common.

Example: ""sugar"": S U G A R? Wrong pattern? We need the third letter A? sugar: position1:S,2:U,3:G,4:A,5:R? But position3 is G not A? So we want position3 to be A? So we can do word with R at position4 and position3 A? So it includes "" A R"" at positions3-4? And then position1,2,5 are unknown.

English words: 
- ""LIAR ?""  5-letter: ""liard"": L I A R D, but I is invalid? And contains I? which we already know is absent.
- ""guard"": G U A R D -> position3 is A? position4 is R? position5:D? So the word is ""GUARD""? G U A R D.

Letters: G,U,A,R,D? A is at position3? And R at position4? Position5:D? 
Are the letters valid? 
 G: not in invalid set? 
 U: allowed?
 D: allowed
 R: at position4? 
 A: at position3? 

Invalid letters are C, N, E, T, I, O? So G,U,D and R,A are allowed? 

So ""guard"" seems a valid word.

Also, can we check uniqueness? But not necessary.

But we know R? So whether R is at position4? If so, we get a green R? If not, then since R must be in positions4 or5, then if R is at position5, then we will get red for R at position4? And yellow for R at position5? Or not? Wait.

For example, if secret has R at position5:
secret: ? ? A ? R
our guess: G U A R D
For position4: R vs secret position4? not R if secret position4 is something else? And secret position5 is R? 
Then feedback: 
Position1: G vs ? 
Position2: U vs secret position2
Position3: A vs secret A: match -> green
Position4: R vs secret what? The secret position4 is not R? So no match? But R is in secret? Since at position5? Then do we mark yellow? Yes.

If secret has R at position4: then position4: R is green.

So we can distinguish.

Therefore, ""guard"" is a good choice.

Another word? ""MARRY"" has A at position2? Not position3.

So ""guard"" is acceptable.

We can try with other common letters.

Alternative: ""HARSH?"" H A R S H? Position3 is R? Not A.

""PARER"" has E,P,A at2? Not position3.

But we select ""guard"".

But note: we have already used U? And D? We are looking to test.

So we'll guess ""guard"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""guard"".After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- From Guess 1 ""crane"": 
  - A is confirmed in position 3 (✓), so the secret word has ""A"" as its third letter.
  - R is present but misplaced (-), so it must be in position 4 or 5 (not positions 1, 2, or 3 due to feedback constraints).
  - C, N, E are absent (x) and cannot be in the word.

- From Guess 2 ""ratio"":
  - R is still misplaced (-), confirming it cannot be in position 1 (as guessed here) or position 2 (from Guess 1). Combined with position 3 being fixed as ""A"", R must be in either position 4 or 5.
  - A is present but misplaced (-) again. Since position 3 is fixed as ""A"" from Guess 1, this dash likely indicates the position 3 ""A"" is the only one and was not reused, or it could imply multiple ""A""s, but the minimal conclusion is no additional ""A"" at position 2.
  - T, I, O are absent (x) and cannot be in the word.

**Constraints summary:**
- **Position 3 is A** (fixed).
- **R must be in position 4 or 5**.
- **Absent letters:** C, E, I, N, O, T (cannot appear).
- **Remaining positions:** Positions 1, 2, and (4 or 5) need to be guessed using valid letters.
- **Valid letters remaining:** B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).

**Strategy for this guess:**
- Test R in position 4 explicitly: If guessed as R and correct, feedback will show ✓; if misplaced but R is in the word, it may be at position 5.
- Use high-frequency valid letters (e.g., S, L, G, D) for positions 1 and 2 to maximize information.
- Avoid wasting positions on R in non-candidate slots or redundant testing of A.
- Word priority: ""guard"" tests R at position 4 and introduces / tests G, U, D:
  - Positions: G (1), U (2), A (3), R (4), D (5).
  - If R is in position 4, feedback will show ✓; otherwise, it will likely be misplaced (-), and position 5 must be R.
  - U and D are new, common letters to gather more feedback.

If ""guard"" is invalid or risky, alternatives like ""sugar"" or ""larnd"" are possible, but ""sugar"" places ""A"" incorrectly (position 4), and ""larnd"" uses ""L"" and ""D"" effectively—yet ""guard"" optimally targets R's placement.

<guess>guard</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)
Guess 3: guard -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the third guess ""guard"":
  G: x -> absent
  U: x -> absent
  A: ✓ -> correct position (position 3, as expected)
  R: ✓ -> correct position (so position 4 is R)
  D: ✓ -> correct position (so position 5 is D)

Therefore, we now know:
- Position 3: A (already known)
- Position 4: R (new)
- Position 5: D (new)

Also, from the feedback, G and U are absent, so we add them to the invalid letters.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ _ A R D

We also know the following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, G, U (from previous feedback)

And we know the word must contain R and A (already placed) and D (placed).

Now, we need to find the first two letters.

Constraints for positions 1 and 2:
- Must be letters that are not in the invalid set: C, E, I, O, T, N, G, U (and also not A, R, D? But they are already placed, so we can use them again? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed. However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates? But the word has A, R, D already? So positions 1 and 2 must be different from A, R, D? Because if they were the same, we would have duplicates? But we don't know.

But from the feedback of ""guard"": 
  We had A, R, D in positions 3,4,5 and they were all correct? So if the secret word had, say, an A in position1, then in ""guard"" we only have one A? So it would not be marked? But we didn't test position1 and2? So we don't know.

But to be safe, we should avoid using A, R, D in positions1 and2? Because if they are not in the word again, we get an absent? But we don't know.

Actually, we have to consider the possibility of duplicates? But we haven't encountered any duplicate feedback? So we assume no duplicates? Or we can test.

But to minimize risk, we can avoid using A, R, D in positions1 and2? Because they are already in the word? So if the secret word has no duplicates, then we avoid incorrect letters? But if it has duplicates, we might miss? But we have no information.

Given the feedback, we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume the secret word has no duplicates? Then positions1 and2 must be letters that are not A, R, D and not in the invalid set.

Invalid letters: C, E, I, O, T, N, G, U

So available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to form a word of the form: ? ? A R D

Common words: 
- BOARD: but O is invalid? and we have O absent? So not.
- HEARD: H E A R D -> but E is invalid? So not.
- LARDY: L A R D Y -> but A is at position2? We need A at position3? So not.
- We need the third letter to be A? So the word must end with ""ARD"".

So words like: 
- S?ARD: e.g., ""sward"", ""shard"", ""guard"" we already tried? ""guard"" is tried? But we tried ""guard"" and it had G,U which are absent? But we are looking for the first two letters.

""shard"": S H A R D -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:D? But we have A,R,D at 3,4,5? So if we guess ""shard"", then we test S and H.

Similarly, ""chard"" has C? invalid.

""board"" has O? invalid.

""heard"" has E? invalid.

""mardy"" is not common? and M A R D Y? A at position2? Not.

So ""shard"" is a candidate: S H A R D.

Also, ""spard""? Not a word.

""stard"" not a word.

""ward"" is 4-letter.

So ""shard"" is a valid word? Yes.

Another: ""bards"" but S at the end? But we need D at the end? ""bards"" is B A R D S? So A at position2? Not.

We need the last three to be A R D? So the first two can be any valid letters? But must form a word.

Other words: 
- ""hardy"" is H A R D Y? A at position2? Not.
- ""lardy"" same.

So ""shard"" is one.

""jardy""? Not a word.

""mardy"" is a word? M A R D Y? Again A at position2? Not.

So we need the third letter to be A? So the word must be of the form: [letter][letter] A R D

So the first two letters? We can have:

- SH as in ""shard""
- Or perhaps ""board"" but O invalid? 
- ""guard"" we tried? But it had G and U? 
- ""award"": A W A R D? But A at position1? And we have A at position3? So if we guess ""award"", then position1: A? But we don't know if A is duplicated? But we have A at position3? So if the secret word has only one A? Then position1 A would be absent? But we don't know.

But we can try? But we have to avoid invalid letters.

""award"": A W A R D? Letters: A, W, A, R, D? But we know W is not invalid? But we have two A's? 

But the secret word has A at position3? So if we guess ""award"", then:
- Position1: A? If secret has no A at position1? Then it would be marked absent? But we know A is in the word? So it would be marked as present? But in the wrong position? But the secret has A at position3? So if we put A at position1? It should be marked as present? But not at position1? So dash? 

But we want to test position1 and2? So we can do that.

But we also have the possibility to use ""shard"".

But let's list possible words: 
- ""shard"": S H A R D
- ""award"": A W A R D
- ""lard"" is 4-letter? 
- ""mard"" is not 5? 
- ""pardy""? Not a word.

""shard"" uses S and H? Both are valid? And we haven't tested them? So we can get feedback on S and H.

Similarly, ""award"" uses A and W? But A is already known? So we test W? But we also test if there is a duplicate A? But we don't know.

But we have limited guesses? So we should avoid using known letters? Because we want to test new letters? So ""shard"" is better? Because it tests two new letters: S and H.

But note: we have position1 and2 to be S and H? And we know the rest.

So we can guess ""shard"".

But we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicates? But we have no evidence? So we assume no duplicates? Then ""shard"" is a good guess.

If we guess ""shard"", and if S and H are correct? Then we get all green? If not, we get feedback.

But we have only two positions left? So we can also try a word that uses more common letters? But we have to use the pattern.

Another word: ""sward"": S W A R D? W is valid? So ""sward"" is a word? Meaning a grassy area? So we can test S and W.

But we have to choose one.

I think ""shard"" is fine.

But let's see the feedback from ""guard"": we got G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)? So the secret word is ? ? A R D.

Now, we know the last three are A R D? So the word ends with ""ARD"".

We need to find the first two letters? From the available letters.

We can also consider: ""bards"" is not? Because it ends with S? Not D.

So I think ""shard"" is a good candidate.

Therefore, we guess ""shard"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**  
  - A is in position 3 (✓), R is present but misplaced (-), and C, N, E are absent (x).

- **Guess 2: ""ratio"" → Feedback: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)**  
  - R is still misplaced (-) and not in position 1, A is present but not in position 2 (misplaced, -), and T, I, O are absent (x).

- **Guess 3: ""guard"" → Feedback: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)**  
  - A (position 3), R (position 4), and D (position 5) are correct (✓), while G and U are absent (x).

### Key Insights:
1. **Fixed Positions**:  
   - Position 3: **A** (confirmed in all guesses).  
   - Position 4: **R** (✓ in ""guard"").  
   - Position 5: **D** (✓ in ""guard"").  
   - The secret word has the form: `_ _ A R D`.

2. **Absent Letters**:  
   - C, E, I, N, O, T (from Guess 1 and 2).  
   - G, U (from Guess 3).  
   - **Total absent**: C, E, G, I, N, O, T, U. These cannot appear anywhere.

3. **Present Letters**:  
   - Only A, R, and D are confirmed present, but they are already correctly placed (positions 3–5).  
   - No other letters are known to be present yet.

4. **Remaining Unknowns**:  
   - Positions 1 and 2 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.  
   - Valid letters for positions 1 and 2: **B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
   - No duplicates are indicated in feedback, so we assume no duplicates (A, R, D cannot reappear in positions 1–2).

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- The secret word ends with ""ARD"" (positions 3–5). We need to guess the first two letters.  
- Prioritize high-frequency valid letters (e.g., S, L, H, P) to maximize information.  
- Test ""shard"" as a candidate:  
  - **S** in position 1 and **H** in position 2.  
  - Both are common letters not yet tested.  
  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on S and H will narrow possibilities (e.g., if S is absent, we eliminate many words like ""shard"", ""sward"", etc.).  
- Alternatives like ""award"" or ""sward"" were considered, but ""award"" wastes a position testing A (already known) and ""sward"" uses W (less common than H). ""shard"" is optimal.

Actually, in our guess, R was in the second position and it was misplaced. But note: the feedback for R is \'-\' meaning it is in the word, just not in that position. However, we don\'t know where it actually is. It could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nAlso, we know from the feedback that the secret word does not start with C (because C is absent), and the second letter is A. So the word has the form: _ A _ _ _\n\nNow, our next guess should try to test more letters and also position the known letters appropriately.\n\nConstraints:\n- Avoid C, N, E.\n- Must include R (somewhere except the second position? Actually, we can put R in any position except the second because we know it\'s not there? But wait: it\'s possible that R could appear multiple times? However, we don\'t have evidence of duplicates. Since the feedback doesn\'t show duplicates unless they are in the word multiple times, and we only have one R in ""crane"", we don\'t know. But typically, we assume no duplicates until we see evidence.\n\nHowever, note the feedback: for ""crane"", we got one R marked as present (misplaced) and the others absent. So the secret word has at least one R.\n\nWe also know the secret word has the letter A in the second position and doesn\'t have C, N, E.\n\nWe should focus on using other common letters and try to place R appropriately.\n\nPossible positions for R: since it cannot be in the second position, it could be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n\nBut note: our guess ""crane"" had R in position 2, which was wrong. So R must be elsewhere, but we don\'t know which of the other positions.\n\nFor the next guess, we want to test R in a different position and also introduce new common letters.\n\nLet me think of a word that:\n- Second letter is A (fixed).\n- Includes R (somewhere except second position).\n- Does not contain C, N, E.\n- Includes other common letters (like S, T, L, etc.)\n\nCommon letters: we can try S, T, L, I, O, P, etc.\n\nExample words with second letter A and including R?\n\nLet\'s try some possibilities:\n\n- Start with R? e.g., words like: RAMPS, but we have to avoid N and E? Wait RAMPS: R (position1), A (position2), M (position3), P (position4), S (position5). But we don\'t know about M, P, S yet.\n\nBut note we can\'t use E, so avoid words ending in E? RAMPS avoids E.\n\nAlternatively: PARTY: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). This uses common letters and includes R in third position.\n\nBut we don\'t know if P, T, Y are present.\n\nAnother: BARDS? B(1),A(2),R(3),D(4),S(5). Avoids the forbidden letters.\n\nBut we have two unknowns: we have R and also B, D, S.\n\nHowever, we also want to cover more ground. Maybe choose a word with S, T, L? Since we know A and R are present, we can focus on other high-frequency letters.\n\nLet me think: we have the second letter fixed as A. We need R somewhere else. And we avoid C, N, E.\n\nLet\'s list some words that fit:\n- SMART: S(1), A(2), M(3), R(4), T(5). This includes S, M, T and R. But note: we already tried C? But here S and T are new.\n\nAlso, note: we are going to get feedback on each letter again.\n\nWe could also try to see if the first letter is known? We don\'t have any hint about the first letter except it cannot be C (because C is absent). So any letter except C and also not N, E (but since the first letter cannot be C, N, E? Actually, we know the word doesn\'t have N and E anywhere). So the first letter cannot be C, N, E? It can be any other letter except C, N, E? Actually, we know the word doesn\'t contain C, N, E at all. So the first letter must be from the remaining 23 letters.\n\nSo all letters in the word must avoid C, N, E.\n\nTherefore, SMART: letters S, A, M, R, T: none of which are C, N, E -> valid.\n\nBut we have R in the fourth position? Let me check the feedback: if we guess ""smart"", then:\n- S: new letter -> could be anywhere?\n- A: already in second position, so that should get a checkmark.\n- R: in fourth position. We know from our previous feedback that R is in the word but not in the second position. We don\'t know about the fourth position.\n\nWe might get more information.\n\nAlternatively, another word: TARES? But E is forbidden? Oh, TARES has E? So avoid since E is absent? Our feedback says E is not in the word, so TARES has E -> invalid.\n\nAnother word: PARTY: P (1), A (2), R (3), T (4), Y (5). This avoids C, N, E.\n\nSimilarly, we could consider: BARKS: but K? and S? And B is new.\n\nBut let me go with SMART because it has common letters S, M, T and R, and we get A again in the second position which we know is fixed. And we test R in the fourth position.\n\nBut note: in our previous guess, R was in position 2 and was wrong. Now we put R in position 4. If R is actually in position 1, 3, or 5, then putting it in 4 will get a \'-\' or even a checkmark? We don\'t know.\n\nHowever, we are trying to gather more information.\n\nAnother idea: we know the word has R and A in the second position. We can try a word with R in the first position to test that. Because if R is in first, then we might get a checkmark.\n\nSo words like: R A _ _ _ \nBut no C, N, E.\n\nExamples: RAPID? But we don\'t know if P, I, D are present? and we avoid E.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t used any of R, A in other positions? Actually, A is fixed in second.\n\nSo R A ? ? ? \n\nPossible words: RALLY? but L and Y and L? Letters: R, A, L, L -> but duplicates? We avoid duplicates? Actually, we can have duplicates? But we don\'t know. However, we have no information. But RALLY has two L\'s? We should avoid for now? Maybe choose without duplicates.\n\nRANKS? but we know N is absent -> invalid because N is not in the word? RANKS contains N -> invalid.\n\nRACER? contains C and E -> invalid.\n\nSo what about: RATIO? but contains T and I and O? and avoids C,N,E? Yes.\n\nRATIO: R(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), O(5). This tests R in position 1. And we test T, I, O.\n\nBut note: we already have A in the second position, so that part is safe.\n\nSo RATIO might be a good guess? Because it tests R at position one and adds common letters T, I, O.\n\nAlternatively, we could try RABID? but B and I? and D? RABID: R(1),A(2),B(3),I(4),D(5). Avoids C,N,E.\n\nBut T and O might be more common? Actually, from letter frequency, E is most common but absent, then T, A, O, I, N (which is absent), S, etc. So T, O, I, S are good.\n\nTherefore, RATIO is a good candidate.\n\nAnother: PARTS? P,A,R,T,S -> that\'s five distinct? P(1),A(2),R(3),T(4),S(5). This places R in the third position? And we avoid the second position? Yes.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested the positions close to the beginning? But RATIO tests position 1 for R.\n\nI think testing R at position 1 is a good idea because if it\'s correct we get a checkmark, and if it\'s not, we know it must be in 3,4,5? Wait, we know it\'s not in position 2.\n\nSo let me choose RATIO.\n\nBut another consideration: we already know that the secret word does not contain C, N, E. And we are trying to find the position of R.\n\nI\'ll go with RATIO because it uses R in first position and common letters T, I, O.\n\nSo my next guess is ""ratio"".\n\nBut wait: what about the feedback? In our previous guess, we had ""crane"" and got R as misplaced. Now when we put R in first position, we might get:\n- If R is the first letter, then ✓\n- If R is not in the first, but is present, then \'-\' (and then we know R is not in position1 either)\n- Or worst, if R is not present? but it must be because we got a \'-\' in the first guess? So it must be present.\n\nSo we\'ll either get R with ✓ or with \'-\'.\n\nSimilarly for A: we know it\'s in the second position, so it should always be ✓.\n\nSo without loss, we can get feedback on the new letters.\n\nTherefore, let\'s guess ""ratio"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is absent (x) → not in the secret word\n- R is present but misplaced (-) → in the secret word, not in position 2\n- A is correct and in position (✓) → second letter is A\n- N is absent (x) → not in the secret word\n- E is absent (x) → not in the secret word\n\nConstraints derived:\n- The secret word has the form _ A _ _ _\n- Must contain R (somewhere except position 2)\n- Cannot contain C, N, E\n- Letters to prioritize for new information: common consonants (e.g., T, S, L, D) and vowels (e.g., I, O, U)\n\nStrategy for this guess:\n- Include R in a new position (position 1 is tested here to quickly validate/invalidate it as a starting letter)\n- Retain A in position 2 (since it\'s confirmed)\n- Avoid C, N, E entirely\n- Introduce new high-frequency letters (T, I, O) to maximize feedback information\n- Choose a word that fits: ""ratio"" meets these criteria (R in position 1, A in position 2, and testing T, I, O)\n\nIf R is in position 1, we may receive a ✓ for R, confirming its position. If R is misplaced again, we narrow its possible locations to positions 3–5. Feedback on T, I, and O will further reduce possibilities.\n\n<guess>ratio</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from two guesses:\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C: x (absent)\n- R: - (present but wrong position)\n- A: ✓ (correct and in the second position, so the secret word has A as the second letter)\n- N: x (absent)\n- E: x (absent)\n\nSecond guess: ""ratio""\n- R: - (present but wrong position)\n- A: - (present but wrong position)  → This is critical! Previously A was in the correct position (second), but now in ""ratio"", A is in the second position again but getting a dash (-). This seems contradictory.\n\nWait, let me check the second guess feedback:\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)\n\nBut in the secret word, we know from the first guess that A is in the second position. However, in this second guess, we put A in the second position again, and now the feedback says A is present but in the wrong position? That cannot be because if A is fixed in the second position, then putting A in second should always give a check.\n\nUnless... the secret word has more than one A? Because if the secret word has two A\'s, then one of them is in the correct position (second), but if we put an A in the second position again, it might not be marked as correct? Actually, no, the feedback rules:\n\nThe usual Wordle rule: \n- If a letter is correct and in the right position, it gets a ✓, regardless of duplicates?\n- However, if there is only one A in the secret word, and it\'s in the second position, then when we put A in the second position we should get ✓ always.\n\nBut here we got A(-) meaning present but wrong position? That implies that in the secret word, A is not in the second position? But that contradicts the first feedback.\n\nWait, the first feedback: for ""crane"", we had A(✓) in the second position. That means the second letter of the secret word is A. So when we guess ""ratio"", which has A in the second position, we should again get ✓ for A.\n\nBut we got A(-) for A? This is inconsistent unless the game changed? Or I misunderstood.\n\nPossible explanation: \n- The secret word has exactly one A? Then the A in second position should be always check when guessed there. So getting dash is impossible if it was correct previously.\n\nWait, unless the feedback for ""ratio"" is entered incorrectly? Or perhaps I misunderstood the feedback format.\n\nLooking back at the user input: ""Guess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)""\n\nThis feedback says A is present but in the wrong position? So what does that mean for the second letter?\n\nBut we know from guess 1: the second letter is A. So if in guess 2 we also have A in second, it must be correct? Unless... there is a bug? Or perhaps it\'s an encoding?\n\nAnother possibility: the secret word has two As? So in the first guess, one of the A\'s was in the correct position? Actually, ""crane"" has only one A? So that A is the only one and it was in the correct position? Then it should be fixed.\n\nBut then in the second guess, we put A in second position again -> must be check.\n\nBut the feedback says dash? This does not make sense logically.\n\nUnless we are misinterpreting the feedback? The feedback is for each letter:\n\nFor ""ratio"":\n- R(1): - → present but wrong position? \n- A(2): - → present but wrong position? But position 2? \n- T(3): x → absent\n- I(4): x → absent\n- O(5): x → absent\n\nBut note: if the secret word has A in position 2, then A(2) in ""ratio"" must be check.\n\nSo this feedback indicates that A is NOT in the second position? Then that contradicts the first guess where we had A(✓) for position 2.\n\nNow I see the problem. The alternative explanation:\n\nIn the first guess, ""crane"" with A(✓) means A is correct and in position 2.\n\nBut in the second guess, we did ""ratio"" and for A(2) we get ""-"", meaning that the letter A is in the word but not in the position we guessed? However, since we guessed it in position 2 again, it must mean that the A we discovered is not in position 2? That can\'t be because we already know it is.\n\nUnless the secret word is not fixed? Or there\'s a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps we should consider duplicate letters? But ""crane"" had one A and ""ratio"" has one A.\n\nPossible error: the game might have been reset? But no, the user says ""make a new guess"" and provides previous feedback.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the feedback for the second guess is relative to the secret word ignoring previous interactions? But that would be foolish.\n\nActually, for ""ratio"", the A in second position must be correct? Because it was already fixed. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement.\n\nBut let\'s think differently. What if the first feedback was misinterpreted? For ""crane"", the feedback was C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x). So A was marked ✓, meaning it\'s correct in that position? So it\'s fixed.\n\nBut then for the same position in a new guess to be dash suggests that we are mistaken? Or it could be a system error.\n\nBut perhaps we should assume that the feedback is correct? Then we must reconsider the implication.\n\nThe only logical explanation is that the secret word has at least two A\'s? Because:\n- In the first guess ""crane"", the A in position 2 was correct (so one A is at position 2).\n- In the second guess ""ratio"", the A in position 2 is the same one? So why dash? Unless: the secret word has two A\'s? And in the second guess, if the secret word has A also in another position? But no.\n\nActually, the feedback in Wordle handles duplicates? Let me recall: typically, if the secret word has duplicate letters, then we must provide the same number of letters? So if the secret word has two A\'s and you guess a word with one A, and that A is in the correct position? The other A remains? But I\'m confused.\n\nExample from real Wordle? Let me think of an example:\n\nSuppose secret word: APPLE? And we guess CRANE:\nC R A N E → APPLE: \nC: absent → x\nR: absent (since APPLE doesn\'t have R) → but wait? In our case R was marked dash? So that\'s different.\n\nAnother example: secret word: BALSA? But let\'s try:\n\nSecret: BALSA\n\nGuess: crane → \nc: x (no C)\nr: (BALSA has no R) → x? But in our first guess we had R(-) so secret must have R.\nSo impossible.\n\nAnother idea: secret word has the second letter not A? But then why did we get A(✓) for position 2 in ""crane""?\n\nUnless... maybe during the first guess, when we had A(✓) it meant that the letter A is in the word and in position 2? So it must be.\n\nBut then why is it dash in the second guess?\n\nUnless the game is not standard Wordle? Maybe the feedback doesn\'t take into account duplicated letters? For instance, if the secret word has a repeated letter? But let\'s assume that.\n\nScenario: the secret word has two A\'s? For example, SECRET: A was in position 2 and also in position 5? For example, word ""PANDA""? But we know from first feedback: R(-), A(✓), and no N, no E, no C? PANDA: PANDA? First guess: crane → \nC: x\nR: (PANDA has no R?) so x? But we had R(-) so PANDA cannot be? Because it has no R.\n\nWhat about ""RADAR""? But RADAR has two A\'s and one R.\n\nFirst guess: crane → RADAR? \nC: absent → x\nR: first letter? We put R in position2 in ""crane""? \ncrane: position1:C,2:R,3:A,4:N,5:E.\n secret word: RADAR: R, A, D, A, R\n\nSo:\nC: x (absent)\nR: in position2? Secret has R in position1 and position5? What happens?\nWordle rule: for R in ""crane"" at position2: \nSecret has R at position1 and position5.\nBut for position2 in guess, we are comparing to secret\'s position2? Which is A? So letter R doesn\'t match. But then it looks for R elsewhere: there is R at position1 and position5. Since position1 is not used yet? Then R at position2 in guess is not in the word at that position? But it is present? So it should be marked as present (dash) because there is an R that is not used? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, at position3: A in guess and secret position2 is A? That matches? So check? Wait:\n\nPosition1 guess C vs secret R: R isn\'t used? Later.\nPosition2 guess R vs secret A: not matching -> but there is R in the secret, so mark as present? So dash.\nPosition3 guess A vs secret D? D vs A? not match? Then how: secret has A at position2? But position2 is already compared? And position5 is R? And also position1 is R? So for guess position3: A. Does secret have A and not matched? Yes, at positions2 and4? But position2 is not available? Then assign to position4? So yes, A is present? But in the wrong position? So it will be dash? But we had A(✓) for position3.\n\nI\'m confused. Let me do step by step for secret ""RADAR"" and guess ""crane"":\n\nsecret: R A D A R\n\nguess: C R A N E\n\n- Check positions one by one:\n  Position1: C vs R -> no match.\n  Position2: R vs A -> no match.\n  Position3: A vs D -> no match.\n  Position4: N vs A -> no match.\n  Position5: E vs R -> no match.\n\nThen, check for yellows:\n  C: not in secret -> black/x\n  R: in secret at positions1 and5? But since position2 doesn\'t match and R is not used, mark the second occurrence? How Wordle does it: usually, it processes first for greens, then yellows.\n\n  Instead, standard is: first, mark all exact matches? None? Then mark present letters.\n\n  secret positions: R(0),A(1),D(2),A(3),R(4) [indices 0-4]\n  guess: C0: absent -> x\n         R1: is in secret? at positions0 or4? But not at position1? Mark one R as present -> - Since we didn\'t use position0 or4 yet.\n         A2: secret has A at positions1 and3. Mark one A as present -> - \n         N3: absent -> x\n         E4: absent -> x\n\nSo then the feedback would be: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(x)\n\nBut then we don\'t have any green? But we know A is at position3 of guess? But it can be matched with either A in secret? So not fixed.\n\nHowever, in this case, we wouldn\'t have A(✓) anywhere? For position3 of guess? We got dash?\n\nBut in our first feedback, we had A(✓) for position3? Because in crabarba guess ""crane"", position3 is A and we had ✓. So we only had ✓ for A? That means there was an exact match.\n\nTherefore, for ""crane"", the feedback was:\nC(x), R(-), A(✓), N(x), E(x)\n\nSo that means for the letter in position3 of the guess? It must have matched the secret at position3.\n\nSo secret has A at position3? Then why in the second guess for ""ratio"", when we put A in position2, we get dash? But that means secret doesn\'t have A at position2? But then how can the secret have A at position3 only? But then in ""crane"" we had A at position3 and it was ✓, meaning secret position3 is A.\n\nAnd in ""ratio"", we put A at position2? If secret position2 is not A, then it might have A elsewhere? But then it should be marked dash if present elsewhere? And we left position3 to be I in ratio? Etc.\n\n So for ""ratio"":\nR at position1: if secret has R but not at position1? Then dash.\nA at position2: secret position2 is not A? But we already know from guess1 that secret position3 is A? So secret position2 is something else. But secret must have an A somewhere? Since it has A at position3. Then in ""ratio"", A at position2 is not correct, but A is in the word in position3, so it is present? So it should be dashed.\n\n So that\'s consistent.\n\n Therefore, from guess1: \n   Position3 of secret is A.  (because A at position3 in guess1 was ✓)\n   R is in the secret (somewhere) but not in position2? Because in guess1 R was at position2 of guess? But secret position2 is not R? Because position2 might be unknown.\n\nBut wait, the feedback for guess1: \n  Position1: C? x\n  Position2: R? - (present but wrong position)\n  Position3: A? ✓  -> secret position3 is A\n  Position4: N? x\n  Position5: E? x\n\nSo secret has R, but not in position2? And secret has no C, N, E.\n\nThen from guess2 ""ratio"":\n  Position1: R? dash - so R is in the word but not at position1? But we know it\'s in the word.\n  Position2: A? dash - so secret has A but not at position2? But we know secret has A? It is at position3? So A should be present elsewhere? So dash is correct because it is present but not at position2.\n  Position3: T? x - absent\n  Position4: I? x - absent\n  Position5: O? x - absent\n\nTherefore, the new information is:\n- T, I, O are absent in the secret word.\n- R is not in position1 (and we know from guess1 not in position2? And position3 is A? So secret positions: \nPosition1: unknown (not C, N, E allowed; but must contain new letters)\nPosition2: unknown (not R, because in guess1 position2 had R and it was not present at position2? And not C,N,E; and now from guess2, not A? So not R and not A at position2? But A is in the word, but not at position2? Because feedback dash.\nPosition3: A (fixed)\nPosition4: unknown (not N,E,C as before, and also from this guess not T,I,O)\nPosition5: unknown (same as position4)\n\nAdditionally, R must be in the word. Since from guess1 we have R(-) and guess2 we have R(-) at position1, and can not be in position2? But position3 is taken by A? So R must be in position4 or position5.\n\nSimilarly, we know the secret word has:\n\n- R at either position4 or position5? Because position1 is not available (we guessed R at position1 and got dash? It means R is not in position1? But that only confirms that position1 is not R? And position2 cannot be R because? We know from guess1 that position2 is not R? So only position4 or position5 remain? But position3 is A? So R must be at position4 or5.\n\nMoreover, the secret word has exactly the two occurrences of letters we know? Or more? We know of R and A? But A is at position3? And R must be at position4 or5. But also we have feedback that A is present? But we already have A at position3? Why did they say dash for A in guess2? Because it\'s already used? Or not. In ""ratio"", we have one A at position2? Which does not match the secret\'s position2? And the secret has A at position3? Which is not used by the A in that guess? But then the algorithm for Wordle-type games is:\n\nThe secret has:\nPosition: 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: A, 4: ?, 5: ?\nAnd we know secret contains R (at position4 or5) and does not contain C,N,E,T,I,O.\n\nNow the feedback for A:\n\nIn guess2, we placed A at position2? Secret has no A at position2? But does secret have another A? We don\'t know? Currently we only know of one A at position3. So for Letter A: \nThere is an A in the secret at position3. But when we guess A at position2, it is not the same A? So the position2 A in guess: \nDoes not match secret\'s position2? And then we have one A in secret at position3? Not used yet? So we mark it as present? Hence the dash.\n\nYes, so that makes sense.\n\nSummary:\n\nSecret word: \n  Position1: some letter (not R, not A, not C, N, E, T, I, O)\n  Position2: some letter (not R, not A, not C, N, E, T, I, O) \n  Position3: A (fixed)\n  Position4: must be R or the letter at position4 is R? But also? Could be something else? We know R must be in the word, and it can only be in position4 or5? Because position1 not, position2 not (from guess1), position3 is held by A.\n\nAnd position4 and5: one of them must be R? Or both? But we don\'t know duplicate.\n\nAlso, all except position3 are unknown letters? But we have constraints: cannot be C,N,E,T,I,O. And also not R at positions1 and2? But position2 can be R? No, in guess1 we put R at position2 and it was dash? So secret position2 is not R. Because if it was R, we would have gotten a green R? But we got dash? That means secret has R, but not at that position.\n\nSo secret position2 is not R.\n\nTherefore, the secret word has the following structure:\n\nLet me denote:\nPos1: some letter (call it X)\nPos2: some letter (call it Y)\nPos3: A\nPos4: either let\'s say letter Z or R? \nPos5: W or R? \nBut either pos4 or pos5 is R? Or both could be R? But unknown.\n\nBut we know the letter at pos2 cannot be R? And pos1 cannot be R? And pos3 is A? So R must be at pos4 or pos5.\n\nAlso, we know there is only one A? Or there might be more? We know at least one? So far in our guesses, words have one A? But secret could have two? We don\'t know.\n\nTo be safe, we must only use the constraints from feedback.\n\nSo we have to guess a 5-letter word that:\n- Doesn\'t contain C, N, E, T, I, O -> invalid letters now: C, N, E, T, I, O\n- Contains R -> R must be in the word? And we know from feedback\n- Has A in the word? But we already know position3 is A.\n\nFor the next guess, we need to test the other positions? Especially positions1,2,4,5.\n\nBut we also want to find where R is.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has R in position4? Then if it\'s correct, we get green? Or if not, then it must be at position5.\n\nAt the same time, use other common letters for positions1 and2.\n\nAvailable letters: not C,N,E,T,I,O? What are they? Let\'s see:\nEnglish alphabet minus the known absent: C, E, I, O, T? And N? So absent: C, E, I, O, T, N\n\nAlso, we know R and A are present? But A is already placed? So for other positions? R is not placed? So for new letters.\n\nCommon letters: S, L, U, D, P, M, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe want to test position4 and5 for R? So make our guess have R at position4 or5?\n\nAlso, position2 can be any letter except the invalid ones? And not R? Because if we put R at position2, we know it\'s not possible? But we won\'t do that.\n\nSo possible word: \nPattern: _ _ A _ R \nSo end with R at position5? With position4 also unknown? Or _A_R_? But position3 is fixed A.\n\nWe can think of words ending with R? Or having R at position4.\n\nBut also, the we need to test position2? Because we have no information about position2? Except that it is not R? And not A? Etc.\n\nSo we want to choose a word that has:\n\n- Letter at position3: A (fixed)\n- Have R in position4 or5? To test.\n- Letters at positions1 and2 are common and not from the invalid set.\n\nLet\'s list candidate words:\n\nEnding with R: \n- Words like ____R with position3:A? So 3:A, 5:R.\n\nWhat is position4? It can be anything? So _ _A # R? where # is a letter? For example, ""BAKER"" has E? Not allowed.\n\nSince position5 is R? We must do XXXAR? Or YY A? R? But wait, position5 R.\n\nThe pattern: ? ? A ? R\n\nFor example: words: GUARD? Doesn\'t have A at position3? \nGUARD: G,U,A,R,D -> position3 is A? But A is at position3? Yes? \nGUARD: position1:G,2:U,3:A,4:R,5:D? So not R at position5? Let me count:\n\nPosition: 1:G, 2:U, 3:A, 4:R, 5:D? So if we want position5 to be R? That\'s not.\n\nWords ending with ...AR? Position4:A, position3 it must be? We need a different structure.\n\nFor the pattern: position3:A, position5:R -> so the last two letters are ? R? But position4 is letter before R? So ending with "" R"" meaning two letters: then for example: ? ? A X R\n\n position1,2? A at position3 and R at position5? With position4 being some letter.\n\nFor example: \n- ""MAGAR"" is not a word? \n- ""JAGAR""? No\n\nBut we need English words.\n\nAnother: ""LARGO"", but O is invalid? \n""PAGER"" has E? Invalid.\n\nWhat about ""SADAR""? Not a word.\n ""BAKAR""? Not English.\n\n ""HAZAR""? Not common.\n\nBetter to think with common letters? Use S, L, D, etc.\n\n""G A L A R""? and then? Word: ""polar""? Position: 1:P,2:O,3:L,4:A,5:R? But O is invalid? And position3 is L not A?\n\nSo with A at position3 and R at position5? So we need the third letter to be A? So the word should be 1:?,2:?,3:A,4:?,5:R\n\nKnown words: \n- ""cigar"" has C? invalid.\n- ""vicar"" has I? invalid.\n- ""cedar"" has E,C? invalid.\n- ""radar"" has R at position1? But we can put? ""radar"": R at position1? But we know position1 cannot be R? Because ""ratio"" had R at1 and got dash? And also ""radar"" has valid letters? R,A at other positions? But we know R is at position1, but we already know R is not at position1.\n\nSo ""radar"" would have position1 R -> but we know it\'s not R? So not then.\n\nOther words: ""agar"" is 4-letter.\n\nWhat about using \'S\' at beginning: ""sa lar""? ""SAYAR""? Not a word.\n\n""manar"" has M,A,N,A? N is invalid.\n\n""capar"" has C.\n\nSo it\'s difficult? Maybe position4 is R? Then the structure: ? ? A R ?\n\nFor example, words that have ""AR"" at position3-4? And then position5 some letter.\n\nWord: ""MARRY"" has two R\'s? Pos4 R and pos5 Y? Pattern: M A R R Y? But the A is at position2? We want A at position3? So not.\n\nWord with A at position3 and R at position4: so ... A R ... like at positions 3 and4: ""AR"" and then position5 something.\n\nFor example:\n- ""STAR "" : S T A R something? 5-letter: ""stark"": S,T,A,R,K -> position4 is R? So pattern: 1:S,2:T,3:A,4:R,5:K. This has S,T,K? T is now invalid? Because from guess2 we know T is absent? So ""stark"" uses T? Cannot.\n\nSimilarly, ""start"" uses T and T.\n""chair"" uses C and I.\n\n""hair"" ? ""HAIRY""?: H A I R Y -> position3 is I? Not A? Also uses I.\n\nBut we need position3 A? \n\nWhat about ""HAREM""? H A R E M? A at2? Not at3.\n\n""aaron"" has O? invalid.\n\n Perhaps the secret word has R at position4? And position5 unknown? Or R at position5? But we haven\'t found many words.\n\nAnother possibility: there is a word that has R at position4? And let\'s accept that position5 is a common letter.\n\nFor example: ""AWAKE""? But E? invalid.\n\n""BASTE"" has E? ""BASIL"" has I? ""BAGEL"" has E,G? ""RAGER"" has E? All invalid.\n\nBut we can restrict: the invalid letters are C,N,E,T,I,O? So valid letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? and we know R and A are present? But A is placed at position3 and R must be one other.\n\nSo for the word, the unknown positions1,2,4,5: must be from the valid letters.\n\n But also, we know position1 cannot be R? Position2 cannot be R? And position3 is A? R is at position4 or5.\n\nLet us try to choose a word that has R at position4? If we put a word with R at position4, then:\n- If R is at position4? We get check? If not, it will be dash if at position5.\n\nAlso, while testing other letters.\n\nSo word suggestion: let\'s pick ""SALAD""? But not: S A L A D? Position3 L? And doesn\'t have R? But R is required? So must include R.\n\nMust have R? So guess a word that includes R.\n\nFor example: ""PULLAR""? Not 5 letters.\n\n""RADII"" has R at1 and I? invalid.\n\n""BARNY"" has R? But N and Y? N is invalid.\n\nPerhaps accept that not all popular letters? We need to test R\'s position. So try a word that has R at position4? Or at5? Let\'s do position4 R.\n\nSo guess a word that has R at position4, and other letter common.\n\nExample: ""sugar"": S U G A R? Wrong pattern? We need the third letter A? sugar: position1:S,2:U,3:G,4:A,5:R? But position3 is G not A? So we want position3 to be A? So we can do word with R at position4 and position3 A? So it includes "" A R"" at positions3-4? And then position1,2,5 are unknown.\n\nEnglish words: \n- ""LIAR ?""  5-letter: ""liard"": L I A R D, but I is invalid? And contains I? which we already know is absent.\n- ""guard"": G U A R D -> position3 is A? position4 is R? position5:D? So the word is ""GUARD""? G U A R D.\n\nLetters: G,U,A,R,D? A is at position3? And R at position4? Position5:D? \nAre the letters valid? \n G: not in invalid set? \n U: allowed?\n D: allowed\n R: at position4? \n A: at position3? \n\nInvalid letters are C, N, E, T, I, O? So G,U,D and R,A are allowed? \n\nSo ""guard"" seems a valid word.\n\nAlso, can we check uniqueness? But not necessary.\n\nBut we know R? So whether R is at position4? If so, we get a green R? If not, then since R must be in positions4 or5, then if R is at position5, then we will get red for R at position4? And yellow for R at position5? Or not? Wait.\n\nFor example, if secret has R at position5:\nsecret: ? ? A ? R\nour guess: G U A R D\nFor position4: R vs secret position4? not R if secret position4 is something else? And secret position5 is R? \nThen feedback: \nPosition1: G vs ? \nPosition2: U vs secret position2\nPosition3: A vs secret A: match -> green\nPosition4: R vs secret what? The secret position4 is not R? So no match? But R is in secret? Since at position5? Then do we mark yellow? Yes.\n\nIf secret has R at position4: then position4: R is green.\n\nSo we can distinguish.\n\nTherefore, ""guard"" is a good choice.\n\nAnother word? ""MARRY"" has A at position2? Not position3.\n\nSo ""guard"" is acceptable.\n\nWe can try with other common letters.\n\nAlternative: ""HARSH?"" H A R S H? Position3 is R? Not A.\n\n""PARER"" has E,P,A at2? Not position3.\n\nBut we select ""guard"".\n\nBut note: we have already used U? And D? We are looking to test.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""guard"".\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""guard"".After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- From Guess 1 ""crane"": \n  - A is confirmed in position 3 (✓), so the secret word has ""A"" as its third letter.\n  - R is present but misplaced (-), so it must be in position 4 or 5 (not positions 1, 2, or 3 due to feedback constraints).\n  - C, N, E are absent (x) and cannot be in the word.\n\n- From Guess 2 ""ratio"":\n  - R is still misplaced (-), confirming it cannot be in position 1 (as guessed here) or position 2 (from Guess 1). Combined with position 3 being fixed as ""A"", R must be in either position 4 or 5.\n  - A is present but misplaced (-) again. Since position 3 is fixed as ""A"" from Guess 1, this dash likely indicates the position 3 ""A"" is the only one and was not reused, or it could imply multiple ""A""s, but the minimal conclusion is no additional ""A"" at position 2.\n  - T, I, O are absent (x) and cannot be in the word.\n\n**Constraints summary:**\n- **Position 3 is A** (fixed).\n- **R must be in position 4 or 5**.\n- **Absent letters:** C, E, I, N, O, T (cannot appear).\n- **Remaining positions:** Positions 1, 2, and (4 or 5) need to be guessed using valid letters.\n- **Valid letters remaining:** B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding absent letters).\n\n**Strategy for this guess:**\n- Test R in position 4 explicitly: If guessed as R and correct, feedback will show ✓; if misplaced but R is in the word, it may be at position 5.\n- Use high-frequency valid letters (e.g., S, L, G, D) for positions 1 and 2 to maximize information.\n- Avoid wasting positions on R in non-candidate slots or redundant testing of A.\n- Word priority: ""guard"" tests R at position 4 and introduces / tests G, U, D:\n  - Positions: G (1), U (2), A (3), R (4), D (5).\n  - If R is in position 4, feedback will show ✓; otherwise, it will likely be misplaced (-), and position 5 must be R.\n  - U and D are new, common letters to gather more feedback.\n\nIf ""guard"" is invalid or risky, alternatives like ""sugar"" or ""larnd"" are possible, but ""sugar"" places ""A"" incorrectly (position 4), and ""larnd"" uses ""L"" and ""D"" effectively—yet ""guard"" optimally targets R\'s placement.\n\n<guess>guard</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: guard -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the third guess ""guard"":\n  G: x -> absent\n  U: x -> absent\n  A: ✓ -> correct position (position 3, as expected)\n  R: ✓ -> correct position (so position 4 is R)\n  D: ✓ -> correct position (so position 5 is D)\n\nTherefore, we now know:\n- Position 3: A (already known)\n- Position 4: R (new)\n- Position 5: D (new)\n\nAlso, from the feedback, G and U are absent, so we add them to the invalid letters.\n\nNow, the secret word has the form: _ _ A R D\n\nWe also know the following letters are absent: C, N, E, T, I, O, G, U (from previous feedback)\n\nAnd we know the word must contain R and A (already placed) and D (placed).\n\nNow, we need to find the first two letters.\n\nConstraints for positions 1 and 2:\n- Must be letters that are not in the invalid set: C, E, I, O, T, N, G, U (and also not A, R, D? But they are already placed, so we can use them again? But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. However, we have no evidence of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates? But the word has A, R, D already? So positions 1 and 2 must be different from A, R, D? Because if they were the same, we would have duplicates? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut from the feedback of ""guard"": \n  We had A, R, D in positions 3,4,5 and they were all correct? So if the secret word had, say, an A in position1, then in ""guard"" we only have one A? So it would not be marked? But we didn\'t test position1 and2? So we don\'t know.\n\nBut to be safe, we should avoid using A, R, D in positions1 and2? Because if they are not in the word again, we get an absent? But we don\'t know.\n\nActually, we have to consider the possibility of duplicates? But we haven\'t encountered any duplicate feedback? So we assume no duplicates? Or we can test.\n\nBut to minimize risk, we can avoid using A, R, D in positions1 and2? Because they are already in the word? So if the secret word has no duplicates, then we avoid incorrect letters? But if it has duplicates, we might miss? But we have no information.\n\nGiven the feedback, we have no indication of duplicates? So we assume the secret word has no duplicates? Then positions1 and2 must be letters that are not A, R, D and not in the invalid set.\n\nInvalid letters: C, E, I, O, T, N, G, U\n\nSo available letters: B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nWe need to form a word of the form: ? ? A R D\n\nCommon words: \n- BOARD: but O is invalid? and we have O absent? So not.\n- HEARD: H E A R D -> but E is invalid? So not.\n- LARDY: L A R D Y -> but A is at position2? We need A at position3? So not.\n- We need the third letter to be A? So the word must end with ""ARD"".\n\nSo words like: \n- S?ARD: e.g., ""sward"", ""shard"", ""guard"" we already tried? ""guard"" is tried? But we tried ""guard"" and it had G,U which are absent? But we are looking for the first two letters.\n\n""shard"": S H A R D -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:A, 4:R, 5:D? But we have A,R,D at 3,4,5? So if we guess ""shard"", then we test S and H.\n\nSimilarly, ""chard"" has C? invalid.\n\n""board"" has O? invalid.\n\n""heard"" has E? invalid.\n\n""mardy"" is not common? and M A R D Y? A at position2? Not.\n\nSo ""shard"" is a candidate: S H A R D.\n\nAlso, ""spard""? Not a word.\n\n""stard"" not a word.\n\n""ward"" is 4-letter.\n\nSo ""shard"" is a valid word? Yes.\n\nAnother: ""bards"" but S at the end? But we need D at the end? ""bards"" is B A R D S? So A at position2? Not.\n\nWe need the last three to be A R D? So the first two can be any valid letters? But must form a word.\n\nOther words: \n- ""hardy"" is H A R D Y? A at position2? Not.\n- ""lardy"" same.\n\nSo ""shard"" is one.\n\n""jardy""? Not a word.\n\n""mardy"" is a word? M A R D Y? Again A at position2? Not.\n\nSo we need the third letter to be A? So the word must be of the form: [letter][letter] A R D\n\nSo the first two letters? We can have:\n\n- SH as in ""shard""\n- Or perhaps ""board"" but O invalid? \n- ""guard"" we tried? But it had G and U? \n- ""award"": A W A R D? But A at position1? And we have A at position3? So if we guess ""award"", then position1: A? But we don\'t know if A is duplicated? But we have A at position3? So if the secret word has only one A? Then position1 A would be absent? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we can try? But we have to avoid invalid letters.\n\n""award"": A W A R D? Letters: A, W, A, R, D? But we know W is not invalid? But we have two A\'s? \n\nBut the secret word has A at position3? So if we guess ""award"", then:\n- Position1: A? If secret has no A at position1? Then it would be marked absent? But we know A is in the word? So it would be marked as present? But in the wrong position? But the secret has A at position3? So if we put A at position1? It should be marked as present? But not at position1? So dash? \n\nBut we want to test position1 and2? So we can do that.\n\nBut we also have the possibility to use ""shard"".\n\nBut let\'s list possible words: \n- ""shard"": S H A R D\n- ""award"": A W A R D\n- ""lard"" is 4-letter? \n- ""mard"" is not 5? \n- ""pardy""? Not a word.\n\n""shard"" uses S and H? Both are valid? And we haven\'t tested them? So we can get feedback on S and H.\n\nSimilarly, ""award"" uses A and W? But A is already known? So we test W? But we also test if there is a duplicate A? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut we have limited guesses? So we should avoid using known letters? Because we want to test new letters? So ""shard"" is better? Because it tests two new letters: S and H.\n\nBut note: we have position1 and2 to be S and H? And we know the rest.\n\nSo we can guess ""shard"".\n\nBut we also have to consider that the secret word might have duplicates? But we have no evidence? So we assume no duplicates? Then ""shard"" is a good guess.\n\nIf we guess ""shard"", and if S and H are correct? Then we get all green? If not, we get feedback.\n\nBut we have only two positions left? So we can also try a word that uses more common letters? But we have to use the pattern.\n\nAnother word: ""sward"": S W A R D? W is valid? So ""sward"" is a word? Meaning a grassy area? So we can test S and W.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nI think ""shard"" is fine.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from ""guard"": we got G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)? So the secret word is ? ? A R D.\n\nNow, we know the last three are A R D? So the word ends with ""ARD"".\n\nWe need to find the first two letters? From the available letters.\n\nWe can also consider: ""bards"" is not? Because it ends with S? Not D.\n\nSo I think ""shard"" is a good candidate.\n\nTherefore, we guess ""shard"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)**  \n  - A is in position 3 (✓), R is present but misplaced (-), and C, N, E are absent (x).\n\n- **Guess 2: ""ratio"" → Feedback: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)**  \n  - R is still misplaced (-) and not in position 1, A is present but not in position 2 (misplaced, -), and T, I, O are absent (x).\n\n- **Guess 3: ""guard"" → Feedback: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)**  \n  - A (position 3), R (position 4), and D (position 5) are correct (✓), while G and U are absent (x).\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Fixed Positions**:  \n   - Position 3: **A** (confirmed in all guesses).  \n   - Position 4: **R** (✓ in ""guard"").  \n   - Position 5: **D** (✓ in ""guard"").  \n   - The secret word has the form: `_ _ A R D`.\n\n2. **Absent Letters**:  \n   - C, E, I, N, O, T (from Guess 1 and 2).  \n   - G, U (from Guess 3).  \n   - **Total absent**: C, E, G, I, N, O, T, U. These cannot appear anywhere.\n\n3. **Present Letters**:  \n   - Only A, R, and D are confirmed present, but they are already correctly placed (positions 3–5).  \n   - No other letters are known to be present yet.\n\n4. **Remaining Unknowns**:  \n   - Positions 1 and 2 must be filled with letters not in the absent list.  \n   - Valid letters for positions 1 and 2: **B, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  \n   - No duplicates are indicated in feedback, so we assume no duplicates (A, R, D cannot reappear in positions 1–2).\n\n### Strategy for Guess 4:\n- The secret word ends with ""ARD"" (positions 3–5). We need to guess the first two letters.  \n- Prioritize high-frequency valid letters (e.g., S, L, H, P) to maximize information.  \n- Test ""shard"" as a candidate:  \n  - **S** in position 1 and **H** in position 2.  \n  - Both are common letters not yet tested.  \n  - If correct, we solve the word. If not, feedback on S and H will narrow possibilities (e.g., if S is absent, we eliminate many words like ""shard"", ""sward"", etc.).  \n- Alternatives like ""award"" or ""sward"" were considered, but ""award"" wastes a position testing A (already known) and ""sward"" uses W (less common than H). ""shard"" is optimal.\n\n<guess>shard</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(✓) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: ratio -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) T(x) I(x) O(x)\nGuess 3: guard -> FEEDBACK: G(x) U(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)\nGuess 4: shard -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the secret word pattern: _ _ A R D (positions 3,4,5 fixed as A,R,D)
From guess 4: ""shard"" -> S(x) H(x) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓)
This means S and H are absent (x), so they are not in the word.

Now, adding to absent letters: S and H are now confirmed absent.
Previous absent letters: C, E, I, N, O, T, G, U (from earlier feedback)
So total absent: C, E, G, H, I, N, O, T, U, S (S and H added)

The secret word must be a 5-letter word of the form: [letter1] [letter2] A R D
Where letter1 and letter2:
- Cannot be any of the absent letters (so not C, E, G, H, I, N, O, T, U, S)
- Must be from the remaining letters: B, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Since no duplicates have been indicated (and we've seen A,R,D in their positions without duplication signs), we assume no duplicates, so letter1 and letter2 cannot be A, R, or D.

We need to form a valid English word of the form ? ? A R D

Possible words:
- BOARD? But O is absent (from guess2: O(x)), invalid.
- HEARD? But E and H are absent? H added as absent in guess4, and E from guess1? So invalid.
- LARD? Only 4 letters? But we need 5: L A R D ... not 5.
- MARDY: M A R D Y -> but pattern requires A at position3? MARDY: if spelled M-A-R-D-Y? That's positions 1:M, 2:A? But we need A at position3? So no.

The word must have the third letter A? So it must be of the form: X1 X2 A R D

Looking for words ending with ""ARD"" that are 5 letters long? And first two letters from the available set.

Common words:
- BARD? But that's 4 letters? 5-letter could be ""bards""? But we need D at position5? ""BARDS"": B,A,R,D,S? But A at position2, D at position4? Not pattern.
- CARD? Again 4 letters.

So less common? But possible words:
- ""sward"" we tried? S is absent? And ""shard"" we tried? Now we need others.

- ""WARD"" is 4 letters? Add a letter? Like ""award"" (but A at position1, not allowed? Because A is already at position3? No duplicates) but we can try.

We already tried ""sward"" not? But S in ""sward"" is absent? So exclude.

Available words:
- ""yard"": not 5 letters.

Consider: 
- ""BARED"" has E? absent.

Another possibility: 
- ""PARED"" has E? absent.
- ""JARED"" has E? not.

What about ""BARYD""? Not a word.

We need to find 5-letter words ending with ""ARD"":

List: 
- Guard (tried)
- Shard (tried)
- Award: A W A R D? 
  - But duplicate A? And we have A at position3? So if we guess ""award"", then:
      Position1: A? If secret has no A at1? Then should be absent? Or marked as present but wrong position? Because secret position3 is A? But we don't have evidence of duplicate? So if we put A at position1? Secret has A only at position3? Then:
      - Position1: A not at1? So mark as present? But we already know A is at position3? So the algorithm might just mark one A? So if secret has no A at1, then A at position1 in guess would get a dash? For example.

But the word ""award"": A W A R D? We have to consider both A's? But secret word has exactly one A? At position3? So:
""award"":
  Position1: A vs secret position1? Not matching, and secret has another A? So mark as present? Then position2: W vs secret position2? No idea? Then position3: A vs secret position3: match -> green? Position4: R vs secret R: green? Position5: D vs secret D: green? 
  But feedback for position1 A: absent? Or dash? Since secret has A at position3? And if we haven't used it? Then mark yellow for A at position1? So dash.

Similarly for the second A? But we are guessing two A's? Position1 and3? Position3: we get green? Position1: dash? Or if only one A? Then position3 uses the only A? So position1 A would be absent? But mark? The feedback? Typically, if you guess a duplicate letter? Then:
  The first A at position1? Doesn't match secret position1? Then check secret: we have one A at position3? Then mark that position3? For position3: we mark green? And then position1 A has nothing? So mark as absent? Because secret only has one A? And it's used? That's the rule? 

For example, secret: APPLE? Guess: PAPER?
P: position0? not at0? But secret has P at position1 and2? Then mark yellow for the first P? 

But in our case? Secret has only one A? At position3? Guess: ""award""
  Position1: A? secret position1: (say) W? Not A? And we have only one A in secret? At position3? Which we haven't compared? 
  Then comparing:
    Position1: A vs W? no match? 
    Position2: W vs (say secret position2)? 
    ... 
    Position3: A vs A? match? Green?
    Now, since the A at position3 is used? Then the A at position1? There is no second A? So it should be marked as absent? Because letter in position1 of guess: A not present? Because the only A is accounted for at position3? So absent.

In Wordle, if a letter appears more times in guess than secret? The excess letters are marked absent? 

So if secret has only one A? And we guess two A's? Then one A (if correct) gets green? The other A gets grey (absent) if not in an position with letter A? 

So in our case? For ""award"": 
  Position1: A? If secret position1 is not A? And secret only has one A? At position3? Then position1 A would get x? Absent.

Therefore? We should avoid using A, R, D in positions1 and2? Because they are likely not present? And if they are? But we don't know? It could be confusing? But since we have no indication of duplicate? It's safer to assume no duplicates? And choose letters not in A,R,D? And not absent.

So for ""award"" it would be a waste? Because A at position1 is likely absent? So it doesn't test the unknown? 

Therefore? We should choose letters that are new? From the valid list.

So for example:

- L and M: ""lard"" is not 5? ""LMARD"" not a word.

""MAR"" words? ""MARDY""? M A R D Y? But position2 is A? Not position3? So the pattern would be M A R D Y? Which is not what we want? We need X1 X2 A R D? So X1 and X2? Then A R D.

For example: 
- K A R D? But that's 4? Add? Like ""kcard"" no.

""PARD"" is 4? ""PARDY"" not common? But let's list:

Common English words ending w ""ARD"": 
- award
- board
- guard
- heard
- shard
- sward
- award
- broad

But:
- board? B O A R D? But O is absent? and O is in absent list? From guess2.
- broad? B R O A D? Pattern: positions? 1:B,2:R,3:O? But we need A at position3? Not O? So no.
- guard? tried.
- heard? H E A R D? H absent? E absent? From guess4? H added absent? And E from guess1? So not.
- sward? S W A R D? S is absent? From guess4.

So ""award"" is the only common word left? But as discussed? It uses A at position1? Which may be not present? But if we guess it? And if position1 and2 are A and W? Then we get feedback? 

Another word: ""bards""? But not ending in RD? We need exactly positions: 1:? 2:? 3:A 4:R 5:D

Other words: 
- ""chord""? Not A at3.
- ""hardy""? H at1? Absent.

Less common: 
- ""JARED"" has E? 
- ""FARD""? Not 5? 
- ""WARDS"": W A R D S? Position5 S? But we need D at position5? This has S? And we need position3 A? Here position2 A? So not.

"" W A R D S"" is 5 letters? But position:1:W,2:A,3:R? But we need position3 to be A? Not R? And D at position4? So not fitting.

So the only possibility is ""award""? A W A R D? Or we must find other words.

Looking for words? For example, ""farad""? F A R A D? But:
  Position1: F
  Position2: A
  Position3: R? But we need A at position3? So not? 

Another: ""narad""? Not a word, and N absent.

Perhaps ""bared""? Has E.

I think ""award"" is the only common word? So we might need to guess that? Even though A is used? 

But we have valid letters: say F and W? But what word? ""fw ard"" not English.

""KWARD""? Not English.

So we try ""award"" as a guess? 

But we can also consider ""laard"" or something? Not.

Another idea: ""pawed"" has E? 

I think only ""award"" works? 

Let me confirm: 
""award"" is a valid English word? Yes? Meaning a prize.

So we guess ""award""?

But if secret word is ""award""? But we have from feedback: We know the secret word is ? ? A R D? And ""award"" is A W A R D? So the pattern? Positions: 
1:A, 2:W, 3:A? but we have A at position3? Correct? And position4:R,5:D? Correct? But also A at position1? Which is not in the pattern? But the pattern doesn't fix position1 and2? So it could be ""award"".

Therefore? We can guess ""award"".

Alternatively? There might be other words like ""barmy"" but not ending in RD.

So we'll go with ""award"".

Therefore? next? guess: ""award"".

Based on the cumulative feedback:

1. **Fixed Positions (confirmed ✓):**
   - Position 3: **A**
   - Position 4: **R**
   - Position 5: **D**  
   → Secret word pattern: `_ _ A R D`

2. **Absent Letters (confirmed x):**  
   C, E, G, H, I, N, O, T, U, S (from earlier feedback + ""shard"" eliminating S and H).

3. **Valid Letters for Positions 1–2:**  
   Letters not absent and not duplicates (since no duplicate indications exist):  
   B, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. **Strategy for Next Guess:**  
   - The pattern `_ _ A R D` must form a valid English word.  
   - Common candidates like ""board"" (O absent), ""guard"" (G absent), ""heard"" (H/E absent), and ""shard"" (S/H absent) are invalid.  
   - ""award"" fits the pattern (`A W A R D`) with **W** (valid letter) tested in position 2 and **A** reused:  
     - Position 1: **A** → Expected dash/misplaced (since secret A is fixed at position 3).  
     - Position 2: **W** → Tests a new high-frequency letter.  
   - Feedback resolves positions 1–2 or confirms ""award"" if feedback shows ✓ for W/A.

   → Secret word pattern: `_ _ A R D`

2. **Absent Letters (confirmed x):**  
   C, E, G, H, I, N, O, T, U, S (from earlier feedback + ""shard"" eliminating S and H).

3. **Valid Letters for Positions 1–2:**  
   Letters not absent and not duplicates (since no duplicate indications exist):  
   B, F, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. **Strategy for Next Guess:**  
   - The pattern `_ _ A R D` must form a valid English word.  
   - Common candidates like ""board"" (O absent), ""guard"" (G absent), ""heard"" (H/E absent), and ""shard"" (S/H absent) are invalid.  
   - ""award"" fits the pattern (`A W A R D`) with **W** (valid letter) tested in position 2 and **A** reused:  
     - Position 1: **A** → Expected dash/misplaced (since secret A is fixed at position 3).  
     - Position 2: **W** → Tests a new high-frequency letter.  
   - Feedback resolves positions 1–2 or confirms ""award"" if feedback shows ✓ for W/A.",Guess 5: award -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) W(✓) A(✓) R(✓) D(✓),SUCCESS
