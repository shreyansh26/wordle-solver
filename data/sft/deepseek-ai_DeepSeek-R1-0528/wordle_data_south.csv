We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. 
Ideally, we want a word that has common letters in the English language (vowels and common consonants) and also tries to cover different positions.

A common starting word used in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N) and all letters are distinct.

Alternatively, ""SALET"" is another good starter but let's go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

We are starting with the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback was all 'x' meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize the information we get. So we should pick a word with common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Some common consonants: S, T, L, M, D, P, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but note E and A are out, so we have O, I, U, and sometimes Y).

 A good candidate might be ""SPLIT"" but it has an I and T. Alternatively, ""MOULD"" but we have to avoid E? Actually, we can use any letter except C,R,A,N,E.

 Another idea: ""PIOUS"" - but let's check if we can get more common letters.

 Since we have no information, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's try to pick a word with common letters: S, T, O, L, I, etc.

 How about ""TOILS""? But that has an S and T and O, I, L.

 Alternatively, ""GHOUL"" - but that has G, H, O, U, L.

 We need to avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let me list some words without these letters:

 - ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> all new letters? Yes, and common.
 - ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T -> also good.
 - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> very common in word games.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has common letters and we haven't tried any of them.

 But note: we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E. ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T -> none of the forbidden letters.

 So I'll go with ""MOIST"".

 However, let me double-check: M, O, I, S, T are all not in the set {C, R, A, N, E}. Correct.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""moist"".

 But note: the feedback format requires the word to be in lowercase? The example was in uppercase? Actually, the example was in uppercase but the input was in lowercase. The problem says ""5-letter English word"", and in the example they used uppercase. However, in the previous guess we used ""crane"" in lowercase and it was accepted.

 To be consistent, we'll use lowercase.

 So, the guess is ""moist"".
</think>
After the first guess ""crane"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know that the letters C, R, A, N, and E are **not** in the secret word. For the next guess, we need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new characters. 

We should prioritize common letters not yet tried, such as S, T, L, M, O, I, D, P, and U. A strong candidate is **""moist""** because:
- It uses 5 new letters (M, O, I, S, T), all common in English words.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- It includes a vowel (O, I) and high-frequency consonants (S, T, M), maximizing information gain.

This guess will help identify new correct letters and positions efficiently.

We have two guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> all letters are incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.

Guess 2: moist -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), I(x), S(-), T(-)

Interpretation of guess 2:
- O is correct and in the correct position. So the secret word has 'O' as the second letter: _ O _ _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position. But note: the second position is already O, so S cannot be there. The S must be in one of the other positions: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th? However, wait: the positions are important. The guess is ""m o i s t"", so:
  Position 1: M -> incorrect (x)
  Position 2: O -> correct (✓)
  Position 3: I -> incorrect (x)
  Position 4: S -> present but wrong position (-)
  Position 5: T -> present but wrong position (-)

So the secret word: 
- Must have 'O' in position 2.
- Must have 'S' somewhere, but not in position 4 (since that's where it was in the guess and it was marked wrong position). Therefore, S is in position 1, 3, or 5? But note: it could be in position 5? However, we have T also in the wrong position at position 5, so S cannot be at position 5? Actually, it can because feedback doesn't specify which one is where. But let's think:

Important: the secret word must contain S and T, but neither is in the position we guessed.

Also, from guess 1, we know the word does not contain C, R, A, N, E. And from guess 2, M and I are not in the word (since marked x).

So excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

We also know the word contains: O (at position 2), S (somewhere, not position 4), and T (somewhere, not position 5).

Possible positions for S: Since position 2 is fixed as O, S can be in position 1, 3, or 5? But wait: position 1 and 3 are also possibilities? And position 5 is not excluded for S because just because T was at position 5 and marked wrong, it doesn't prevent S from being at position 5? Actually, it can be, but note: T is also present and must be in a position other than 5? Similarly, S cannot be in position 4 because that's where we guessed and it was wrong.

Therefore:
- The secret word has O at position 2.
- It does not have M (so first letter not M) or I (so third letter not I).
- It has S and T, but S cannot be at position 4 and T cannot be at position 5? Or can S be at position 1? Or position 3? And T can be at position 1, 3, or 4?

But note: the position of S: we know it is not at position 4 because we put it at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position. Therefore, it must be in one of {1, 3, 5}.

Similarly, T is not at position 5, so it must be in one of {1, 3, 4}.

But wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is O.

Now, we need a word that has:
- O as the second letter
- Contains S and T (and one more letter? Wait: we have three known letters? O, S, T. But the word is 5 letters so we need two more letters plus O,S,T? Actually, O is one, S and T are two more, so two more letters? And one of the positions is O.

Total known: O is fixed at position 2. And we know the word has S and T. We also know the word does not have: C,R,A,N,E,M,I. And we have two letters to find? Actually, we don't know how many unique letters? The word might have repeated letters? Though with the feedback so far, we have no evidence of duplicates.

But let's assume no duplicates for now? Or we don't know.

Now, for our next guess, we need to include the known letters properly and test possible positions.

We know:
- Position 2: O
- The word has S, but not in position 4 (from our guess). Also, since we haven't tested position 1,3,5 for S, we can try to test those.
- The word has T, but not in position 5.

So possible positions for S: 1, 3, or 5.
Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4? Because position 5 was T and it was marked wrong? So T is not in position 5? Therefore, T must be in 1,3, or 4.

But note: if we put T in position 1 and S in position 5? Or other combinations.

We also must avoid the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But O is already used in position 2? And S and T must appear at least once? And we are using a 5-letter word.

For the next guess, we want to figure out the positions of S and T and also discover the other letters.

We can try a word that has:
- At position 2: O (because we know it's correct, and including known correct letters helps get the other feedback faster)
- And then try to put S in position 1 and T in position 3? And then we can test others? But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

For example, we try: S O T _ _

But the last two letters we don't know? We can choose an available letter? We have to form a valid word.

Possible word: ""SOTHO""? Wait, what words have S at position 1 and O at position 2? and then T? 

Ideal if we can test S in position 1 and T in position 3? And then the remaining two can be letters we haven't tried? Let's think:

We can use a word that starts with ""SO"" and then has T? Then two new letters? Like ""SOUTH"" but that has U and T H? But U and H are available? But is SOUTH valid? Yes. However, we have T? The feedback: we already know T is in the word? But we can test if T is at position 3? And also test U and H? 

But note: if T is at position 3, then in our guess ""south"", T is at position 4? We want T in position 3? Alternatively, ""sooty""? But that has O repeated? And in our first guess we ruled out O? Actually, O is in the word? We don't know if it's duplicated? Also, we shouldn't repeat? But let's consider:

Another idea: we need to cover positions that we haven't tested. Specifically, for S: we think it might be at 1,3,5. T at 1,3,4.

We can design a guess that tests S in position 1? And T in position 3? So we can try a word: S O T???

But what 5-letter words? Let me think:

Word: ""SOTOL""? Not common? We want common words? Or ""SOULT""? Not a word?

Alternatively, we can try ""SHOUT"", but that has H and U? And we haven't tested T? Actually, ""shout"" has T at last? So:

Position: 
1: S
2: O (correct)
3: H? 
4: U?
5: T

But T is at position 5? We know T is in the word? But note: we cannot put T at position 5? Because in the previous guess, we had T at position 5 and it was marked as wrong position? Meaning T is neither at position 5? Therefore, this guess would fail because we have T at position 5? We already know T isn't at position 5? So if we put T at position 5, the feedback will show it? But we want to use it? Avoid T at position 5? So we cannot use words ending with T? Because we know T is not the last letter? So ""shout"" is invalid? Actually, we can still guess? The feedback would indicate if T is at the last? Which we already know? But we are trying to find T at other positions? Therefore, for efficiency, we avoid T at position 5? Because we already know it's wrong?

Yes, we know T is not at position 5? So we should avoid putting T at position 5? To avoid wasting? Actually, we can still put T at position 5? But it would be marked as wrong? And we already know? So it doesn't give new info? Therefore, we should avoid.

Similarly, we know S is not at position 4? So we avoid S at position 4? And now we want to test S at position 1 or 3 or 5? But if we put S at position 5? We don't know? We can test that? Similarly, T at position 4? We don't know? 

So let's design a word:

- Must have O at position 2.
- S must be at either position 1, 3, or 5? For this guess, let's choose position 1? So first letter S; then O at second; then we can put T at position 3? But we need two more letters? We can pick two new letters? For example, we have B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, U, V, etc? 

Word: ""S O T H Y"" -> ""so thy"" is not a word? ""sothy"" no? 

How about ""S O U T H""? Wait, ""south"" has S at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4, H at 5? But then T is at 4? Which might be tested? Also, we are testing H? Is that good? But word: ""south"" is valid.

Alternatively, we could put S at position 3? So third letter S, and T at position 1? For example, ""TOPSY""? ""topsy""? With T at 1 and S at 4? But position 4? We know S cannot be at 4? Because we tried at 4 in ""moist"" and it was wrong? So we avoid S at 4? So we cannot put S at 4? Therefore, in the word ""topsy"", T at 1, O at 2, P at 3, S at 4? But S at position 4: we already know this is an impossible location? So we cannot use that? Then it's invalid? So avoid S at 4? Therefore, S must be at 1,3 or 5? Therefore, in ""topsy"" if we put S at 4? It's not valid? Actually we know S shouldn't be at 4? So ""topsy"" isn't a good choice? Unless we avoid S at 4? Let's move on.

Another possibility: put S at position 5? For example, ""W O T S?"" Then ""worts""? But ""wort"" is 4 letters? ""worts"" with W at 1, O at 2, R at 3? But R is excluded? R is in excluded? R was in first guess? We had R(x) from ""crane""? So R is not in the word? So we cannot use R? That's important.

So we must also avoid R? So letters we can use: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And O,S,T? But O is at 2? And S and T have to appear? We might use duplicates? But let's avoid for now.

I think we should try to test S at position 1? So:

1: S
2: O
3: ? (cannot be R, A, N, E, M, I, etc. and we haven't tested? We need to test a new letter? Also T? But T might be at position 3? 
4: ? 
5: ? 

But we also want to test T? We know T is in the word? We can try putting T at position 4? Because we don't know about position 4? For T? We can also put T at position 3? But let's try T at position 3? So:

Word: ""S O T"" and then two letters? How about ""S O T H Y""? But ""Sothy"" is not a word? 

Word: ""SOTHY""? Not a word? 

How about ""SOUL T"" -> ""soult"" not a word? 

Another idea: ""STO L K""? ""stolk"" not a word? 

Let's list possible words:

Common word with S at start and O at position 2: ""sound""? But ""sound"" has N? Excluded? Because N(x) from first guess? 

""soppy""? P is new? But ""soppy"" has P? But then T? We don't have T? But we want to test T? How about ""soft y""? ""softy"": 
- Positions: S (1), O (2), F (3), T (4), Y (5)

Let's see:

""soft"":
S at 1: we are testing S in position 1? We currently don't know if it's in 1 or not? 
O at 2: correct
F at 3: new
T at 4: testing T in position 4? Because we have T at 5 in the first guess? Not tested at 4?
Y at 5: new letter?

But note: T is at position 4? We know T cannot be at 5? So let's see if 4 is possible? Also, we know S cannot be at 4? But we haven't tested position 1 for S? So this is valid?

Word: ""softy"" — is it a word? Softy means sentimental? Yes, it is.

So let me use ""softy"" as a candidate: 
- S at position 1? Might be correct or not?
- O at 2: correct
- F at 3: new letter? We don't know? Will be tested?
- T at position 4? Testing if T is at position 4? Given we know T cannot be at 5? So position 4 is possible?
- Y at 5: new?

Also, if S is at position 1? If it gets ✓, then we know. If it gets - or x? Similarly T? 

Therefore, this tests S at position 1 and T at position 4.

But note: if the secret word has T at position 4? Or somewhere else? We don't know? Also, if S is not at 1? Then we have feedback.

Another candidate: we could put T at position 3? For example, ""so th y""? Like ""sothy"" not a word? 

""sooty""? But O is repeated? And we don't know if there are duplicates? Also, O is already at 2? So ""sooty"" has O at 2 and 3: 
- S at 1? Then O at 2, O also at 3? But the secret word might have two O? But we don't know? Also, we have excluded letters? Actually O is in the word? So another O? But the feedback: we saw O only at position 2? In guess 2? So it might be duplicated? 

But let me avoid duplication? For simplicity.

I think ""softy"" is a good candidate? 

But wait: we have a dash for S in the previous guess? How many S are there? We don't know? Could one S be at position 1? 

So I will go with ""softy""

After checking: F and Y? We haven't tried? So we can get feedback on F and Y? And on the position of S and T.

But note: in ""softy"", we have T at position 4? Which might be a candidate? And S at position 1? Also, Y at position 5? What if the secret word doesn't have Y? We will find out.

So I think that's acceptable.

Therefore, next guess: ""softy""

But let me confirm: 
- We avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I? Yes? S,O,F,T,Y? O is used? But O is known? S and T are known? F and Y are new? Good.

But wait: we already know S and T are in the word? So if we put them in new positions? The feedback will show if the position is correct? Specifically:
- If S is at position 1? Then we get ✓? If not, but it's in the word? We get - and then we know it's not at 1? Similarly for T at 4? 

It will help pin down the positions.

So I choose ""softy"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: moist** → Feedback:  
  - ✓ for O at position 2 → **O is confirmed at position 2**.  
  - - for S at position 4 → **S is in the word but not at position 4**.  
  - - for T at position 5 → **T is in the word but not at position 5**.  
  - x for M and I → **M and I are absent** from the word.  

### Constraints for the next guess:
- Secret word format: `_ O _ _ _` (O is fixed at position 2).  
- **Must include S and T** (S ≠ position 4, T ≠ position 5).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.  
- **Possible positions for S**: 1, 3, or 5 (test one to narrow down).  
- **Possible positions for T**: 1, 3, or 4 (test one to narrow down).  
- Preference for common words with untested letters to gain new information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **S at position 1** and **T at position 4** (both untested positions).  
- Include two new untested letters (e.g., F and Y) to maximize feedback.  
- **Chosen word: ""softy""** (valid English word):  
  - Position 1: S (test if S is at 1)  
  - Position 2: O (fixed ✓)  
  - Position 3: F (untested)  
  - Position 4: T (test if T is at 4)  
  - Position 5: Y (untested)  

This guess efficiently narrows S/T positions and checks F/Y for presence/absence.

<guess>softy</guess>",softy,"We have two guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> all letters are incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.

Guess 2: moist -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), I(x), S(-), T(-)

Interpretation of guess 2:
- O is correct and in the correct position. So the secret word has 'O' as the second letter: _ O _ _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position. But note: the second position is already O, so S cannot be there. The S must be in one of the other positions: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th? However, wait: the positions are important. The guess is ""m o i s t"", so:
  Position 1: M -> incorrect (x)
  Position 2: O -> correct (✓)
  Position 3: I -> incorrect (x)
  Position 4: S -> present but wrong position (-)
  Position 5: T -> present but wrong position (-)

So the secret word: 
- Must have 'O' in position 2.
- Must have 'S' somewhere, but not in position 4 (since that's where it was in the guess and it was marked wrong position). Therefore, S is in position 1, 3, or 5? But note: it could be in position 5? However, we have T also in the wrong position at position 5, so S cannot be at position 5? Actually, it can because feedback doesn't specify which one is where. But let's think:

Important: the secret word must contain S and T, but neither is in the position we guessed.

Also, from guess 1, we know the word does not contain C, R, A, N, E. And from guess 2, M and I are not in the word (since marked x).

So excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

We also know the word contains: O (at position 2), S (somewhere, not position 4), and T (somewhere, not position 5).

Possible positions for S: Since position 2 is fixed as O, S can be in position 1, 3, or 5? But wait: position 1 and 3 are also possibilities? And position 5 is not excluded for S because just because T was at position 5 and marked wrong, it doesn't prevent S from being at position 5? Actually, it can be, but note: T is also present and must be in a position other than 5? Similarly, S cannot be in position 4 because that's where we guessed and it was wrong.

Therefore:
- The secret word has O at position 2.
- It does not have M (so first letter not M) or I (so third letter not I).
- It has S and T, but S cannot be at position 4 and T cannot be at position 5? Or can S be at position 1? Or position 3? And T can be at position 1, 3, or 4?

But note: the position of S: we know it is not at position 4 because we put it at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position. Therefore, it must be in one of {1, 3, 5}.

Similarly, T is not at position 5, so it must be in one of {1, 3, 4}.

But wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is O.

Now, we need a word that has:
- O as the second letter
- Contains S and T (and one more letter? Wait: we have three known letters? O, S, T. But the word is 5 letters so we need two more letters plus O,S,T? Actually, O is one, S and T are two more, so two more letters? And one of the positions is O.

Total known: O is fixed at position 2. And we know the word has S and T. We also know the word does not have: C,R,A,N,E,M,I. And we have two letters to find? Actually, we don't know how many unique letters? The word might have repeated letters? Though with the feedback so far, we have no evidence of duplicates.

But let's assume no duplicates for now? Or we don't know.

Now, for our next guess, we need to include the known letters properly and test possible positions.

We know:
- Position 2: O
- The word has S, but not in position 4 (from our guess). Also, since we haven't tested position 1,3,5 for S, we can try to test those.
- The word has T, but not in position 5.

So possible positions for S: 1, 3, or 5.
Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4? Because position 5 was T and it was marked wrong? So T is not in position 5? Therefore, T must be in 1,3, or 4.

But note: if we put T in position 1 and S in position 5? Or other combinations.

We also must avoid the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But O is already used in position 2? And S and T must appear at least once? And we are using a 5-letter word.

For the next guess, we want to figure out the positions of S and T and also discover the other letters.

We can try a word that has:
- At position 2: O (because we know it's correct, and including known correct letters helps get the other feedback faster)
- And then try to put S in position 1 and T in position 3? And then we can test others? But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

For example, we try: S O T _ _

But the last two letters we don't know? We can choose an available letter? We have to form a valid word.

Possible word: ""SOTHO""? Wait, what words have S at position 1 and O at position 2? and then T? 

Ideal if we can test S in position 1 and T in position 3? And then the remaining two can be letters we haven't tried? Let's think:

We can use a word that starts with ""SO"" and then has T? Then two new letters? Like ""SOUTH"" but that has U and T H? But U and H are available? But is SOUTH valid? Yes. However, we have T? The feedback: we already know T is in the word? But we can test if T is at position 3? And also test U and H? 

But note: if T is at position 3, then in our guess ""south"", T is at position 4? We want T in position 3? Alternatively, ""sooty""? But that has O repeated? And in our first guess we ruled out O? Actually, O is in the word? We don't know if it's duplicated? Also, we shouldn't repeat? But let's consider:

Another idea: we need to cover positions that we haven't tested. Specifically, for S: we think it might be at 1,3,5. T at 1,3,4.

We can design a guess that tests S in position 1? And T in position 3? So we can try a word: S O T???

But what 5-letter words? Let me think:

Word: ""SOTOL""? Not common? We want common words? Or ""SOULT""? Not a word?

Alternatively, we can try ""SHOUT"", but that has H and U? And we haven't tested T? Actually, ""shout"" has T at last? So:

Position: 
1: S
2: O (correct)
3: H? 
4: U?
5: T

But T is at position 5? We know T is in the word? But note: we cannot put T at position 5? Because in the previous guess, we had T at position 5 and it was marked as wrong position? Meaning T is neither at position 5? Therefore, this guess would fail because we have T at position 5? We already know T isn't at position 5? So if we put T at position 5, the feedback will show it? But we want to use it? Avoid T at position 5? So we cannot use words ending with T? Because we know T is not the last letter? So ""shout"" is invalid? Actually, we can still guess? The feedback would indicate if T is at the last? Which we already know? But we are trying to find T at other positions? Therefore, for efficiency, we avoid T at position 5? Because we already know it's wrong?

Yes, we know T is not at position 5? So we should avoid putting T at position 5? To avoid wasting? Actually, we can still put T at position 5? But it would be marked as wrong? And we already know? So it doesn't give new info? Therefore, we should avoid.

Similarly, we know S is not at position 4? So we avoid S at position 4? And now we want to test S at position 1 or 3 or 5? But if we put S at position 5? We don't know? We can test that? Similarly, T at position 4? We don't know? 

So let's design a word:

- Must have O at position 2.
- S must be at either position 1, 3, or 5? For this guess, let's choose position 1? So first letter S; then O at second; then we can put T at position 3? But we need two more letters? We can pick two new letters? For example, we have B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, U, V, etc? 

Word: ""S O T H Y"" -> ""so thy"" is not a word? ""sothy"" no? 

How about ""S O U T H""? Wait, ""south"" has S at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4, H at 5? But then T is at 4? Which might be tested? Also, we are testing H? Is that good? But word: ""south"" is valid.

Alternatively, we could put S at position 3? So third letter S, and T at position 1? For example, ""TOPSY""? ""topsy""? With T at 1 and S at 4? But position 4? We know S cannot be at 4? Because we tried at 4 in ""moist"" and it was wrong? So we avoid S at 4? So we cannot put S at 4? Therefore, in the word ""topsy"", T at 1, O at 2, P at 3, S at 4? But S at position 4: we already know this is an impossible location? So we cannot use that? Then it's invalid? So avoid S at 4? Therefore, S must be at 1,3 or 5? Therefore, in ""topsy"" if we put S at 4? It's not valid? Actually we know S shouldn't be at 4? So ""topsy"" isn't a good choice? Unless we avoid S at 4? Let's move on.

Another possibility: put S at position 5? For example, ""W O T S?"" Then ""worts""? But ""wort"" is 4 letters? ""worts"" with W at 1, O at 2, R at 3? But R is excluded? R is in excluded? R was in first guess? We had R(x) from ""crane""? So R is not in the word? So we cannot use R? That's important.

So we must also avoid R? So letters we can use: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And O,S,T? But O is at 2? And S and T have to appear? We might use duplicates? But let's avoid for now.

I think we should try to test S at position 1? So:

1: S
2: O
3: ? (cannot be R, A, N, E, M, I, etc. and we haven't tested? We need to test a new letter? Also T? But T might be at position 3? 
4: ? 
5: ? 

But we also want to test T? We know T is in the word? We can try putting T at position 4? Because we don't know about position 4? For T? We can also put T at position 3? But let's try T at position 3? So:

Word: ""S O T"" and then two letters? How about ""S O T H Y""? But ""Sothy"" is not a word? 

Word: ""SOTHY""? Not a word? 

How about ""SOUL T"" -> ""soult"" not a word? 

Another idea: ""STO L K""? ""stolk"" not a word? 

Let's list possible words:

Common word with S at start and O at position 2: ""sound""? But ""sound"" has N? Excluded? Because N(x) from first guess? 

""soppy""? P is new? But ""soppy"" has P? But then T? We don't have T? But we want to test T? How about ""soft y""? ""softy"": 
- Positions: S (1), O (2), F (3), T (4), Y (5)

Let's see:

""soft"":
S at 1: we are testing S in position 1? We currently don't know if it's in 1 or not? 
O at 2: correct
F at 3: new
T at 4: testing T in position 4? Because we have T at 5 in the first guess? Not tested at 4?
Y at 5: new letter?

But note: T is at position 4? We know T cannot be at 5? So let's see if 4 is possible? Also, we know S cannot be at 4? But we haven't tested position 1 for S? So this is valid?

Word: ""softy"" — is it a word? Softy means sentimental? Yes, it is.

So let me use ""softy"" as a candidate: 
- S at position 1? Might be correct or not?
- O at 2: correct
- F at 3: new letter? We don't know? Will be tested?
- T at position 4? Testing if T is at position 4? Given we know T cannot be at 5? So position 4 is possible?
- Y at 5: new?

Also, if S is at position 1? If it gets ✓, then we know. If it gets - or x? Similarly T? 

Therefore, this tests S at position 1 and T at position 4.

But note: if the secret word has T at position 4? Or somewhere else? We don't know? Also, if S is not at 1? Then we have feedback.

Another candidate: we could put T at position 3? For example, ""so th y""? Like ""sothy"" not a word? 

""sooty""? But O is repeated? And we don't know if there are duplicates? Also, O is already at 2? So ""sooty"" has O at 2 and 3: 
- S at 1? Then O at 2, O also at 3? But the secret word might have two O? But we don't know? Also, we have excluded letters? Actually O is in the word? So another O? But the feedback: we saw O only at position 2? In guess 2? So it might be duplicated? 

But let me avoid duplication? For simplicity.

I think ""softy"" is a good candidate? 

But wait: we have a dash for S in the previous guess? How many S are there? We don't know? Could one S be at position 1? 

So I will go with ""softy""

After checking: F and Y? We haven't tried? So we can get feedback on F and Y? And on the position of S and T.

But note: in ""softy"", we have T at position 4? Which might be a candidate? And S at position 1? Also, Y at position 5? What if the secret word doesn't have Y? We will find out.

So I think that's acceptable.

Therefore, next guess: ""softy""

But let me confirm: 
- We avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I? Yes? S,O,F,T,Y? O is used? But O is known? S and T are known? F and Y are new? Good.

But wait: we already know S and T are in the word? So if we put them in new positions? The feedback will show if the position is correct? Specifically:
- If S is at position 1? Then we get ✓? If not, but it's in the word? We get - and then we know it's not at 1? Similarly for T at 4? 

It will help pin down the positions.

So I choose ""softy"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: moist** → Feedback:  
  - ✓ for O at position 2 → **O is confirmed at position 2**.  
  - - for S at position 4 → **S is in the word but not at position 4**.  
  - - for T at position 5 → **T is in the word but not at position 5**.  
  - x for M and I → **M and I are absent** from the word.  

### Constraints for the next guess:
- Secret word format: `_ O _ _ _` (O is fixed at position 2).  
- **Must include S and T** (S ≠ position 4, T ≠ position 5).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.  
- **Possible positions for S**: 1, 3, or 5 (test one to narrow down).  
- **Possible positions for T**: 1, 3, or 4 (test one to narrow down).  
- Preference for common words with untested letters to gain new information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **S at position 1** and **T at position 4** (both untested positions).  
- Include two new untested letters (e.g., F and Y) to maximize feedback.  
- **Chosen word: ""softy""** (valid English word):  
  - Position 1: S (test if S is at 1)  
  - Position 2: O (fixed ✓)  
  - Position 3: F (untested)  
  - Position 4: T (test if T is at 4)  
  - Position 5: Y (untested)  

This guess efficiently narrows S/T positions and checks F/Y for presence/absence.",Guess 3: softy -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(✓) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,south,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since there is no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. 
Ideally, we want a word that has common letters in the English language (vowels and common consonants) and also tries to cover different positions.

A common starting word used in Wordle is ""CRANE"" because it contains two vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N) and all letters are distinct.

Alternatively, ""SALET"" is another good starter but let's go with ""CRANE"" for the first guess.

We'll use ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are starting with the first guess: ""crane"" and the feedback was all 'x' meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 Let's think of common letters that are left: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We want to maximize the information we get. So we should pick a word with common letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Some common consonants: S, T, L, M, D, P, etc. and vowels: O, I, U (but note E and A are out, so we have O, I, U, and sometimes Y).

 A good candidate might be ""SPLIT"" but it has an I and T. Alternatively, ""MOULD"" but we have to avoid E? Actually, we can use any letter except C,R,A,N,E.

 Another idea: ""PIOUS"" - but let's check if we can get more common letters.

 Since we have no information, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Let's try to pick a word with common letters: S, T, O, L, I, etc.

 How about ""TOILS""? But that has an S and T and O, I, L.

 Alternatively, ""GHOUL"" - but that has G, H, O, U, L.

 We need to avoid the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let me list some words without these letters:

 - ""SPLIT"": S, P, L, I, T -> all new letters? Yes, and common.
 - ""DOUBT"": D, O, U, B, T -> also good.
 - ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T -> very common in word games.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has common letters and we haven't tried any of them.

 But note: we are avoiding C, R, A, N, E. ""MOIST"" has M, O, I, S, T -> none of the forbidden letters.

 So I'll go with ""MOIST"".

 However, let me double-check: M, O, I, S, T are all not in the set {C, R, A, N, E}. Correct.

 Therefore, the next guess is ""moist"".

 But note: the feedback format requires the word to be in lowercase? The example was in uppercase? Actually, the example was in uppercase but the input was in lowercase. The problem says ""5-letter English word"", and in the example they used uppercase. However, in the previous guess we used ""crane"" in lowercase and it was accepted.

 To be consistent, we'll use lowercase.

 So, the guess is ""moist"".After the first guess ""crane"" received all ""x"" feedback, we know that the letters C, R, A, N, and E are **not** in the secret word. For the next guess, we need a 5-letter word that avoids these letters entirely to test new characters. 

We should prioritize common letters not yet tried, such as S, T, L, M, O, I, D, P, and U. A strong candidate is **""moist""** because:
- It uses 5 new letters (M, O, I, S, T), all common in English words.
- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- It includes a vowel (O, I) and high-frequency consonants (S, T, M), maximizing information gain.

This guess will help identify new correct letters and positions efficiently.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(-) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and feedback:

Guess 1: crane -> all letters are incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.

Guess 2: moist -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), I(x), S(-), T(-)

Interpretation of guess 2:
- O is correct and in the correct position. So the secret word has 'O' as the second letter: _ O _ _ _
- S is in the word but in the wrong position. But note: the second position is already O, so S cannot be there. The S must be in one of the other positions: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th? However, wait: the positions are important. The guess is ""m o i s t"", so:
  Position 1: M -> incorrect (x)
  Position 2: O -> correct (✓)
  Position 3: I -> incorrect (x)
  Position 4: S -> present but wrong position (-)
  Position 5: T -> present but wrong position (-)

So the secret word: 
- Must have 'O' in position 2.
- Must have 'S' somewhere, but not in position 4 (since that's where it was in the guess and it was marked wrong position). Therefore, S is in position 1, 3, or 5? But note: it could be in position 5? However, we have T also in the wrong position at position 5, so S cannot be at position 5? Actually, it can because feedback doesn't specify which one is where. But let's think:

Important: the secret word must contain S and T, but neither is in the position we guessed.

Also, from guess 1, we know the word does not contain C, R, A, N, E. And from guess 2, M and I are not in the word (since marked x).

So excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

We also know the word contains: O (at position 2), S (somewhere, not position 4), and T (somewhere, not position 5).

Possible positions for S: Since position 2 is fixed as O, S can be in position 1, 3, or 5? But wait: position 1 and 3 are also possibilities? And position 5 is not excluded for S because just because T was at position 5 and marked wrong, it doesn't prevent S from being at position 5? Actually, it can be, but note: T is also present and must be in a position other than 5? Similarly, S cannot be in position 4 because that's where we guessed and it was wrong.

Therefore:
- The secret word has O at position 2.
- It does not have M (so first letter not M) or I (so third letter not I).
- It has S and T, but S cannot be at position 4 and T cannot be at position 5? Or can S be at position 1? Or position 3? And T can be at position 1, 3, or 4?

But note: the position of S: we know it is not at position 4 because we put it at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position. Therefore, it must be in one of {1, 3, 5}.

Similarly, T is not at position 5, so it must be in one of {1, 3, 4}.

But wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is O.

Now, we need a word that has:
- O as the second letter
- Contains S and T (and one more letter? Wait: we have three known letters? O, S, T. But the word is 5 letters so we need two more letters plus O,S,T? Actually, O is one, S and T are two more, so two more letters? And one of the positions is O.

Total known: O is fixed at position 2. And we know the word has S and T. We also know the word does not have: C,R,A,N,E,M,I. And we have two letters to find? Actually, we don't know how many unique letters? The word might have repeated letters? Though with the feedback so far, we have no evidence of duplicates.

But let's assume no duplicates for now? Or we don't know.

Now, for our next guess, we need to include the known letters properly and test possible positions.

We know:
- Position 2: O
- The word has S, but not in position 4 (from our guess). Also, since we haven't tested position 1,3,5 for S, we can try to test those.
- The word has T, but not in position 5.

So possible positions for S: 1, 3, or 5.
Possible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4? Because position 5 was T and it was marked wrong? So T is not in position 5? Therefore, T must be in 1,3, or 4.

But note: if we put T in position 1 and S in position 5? Or other combinations.

We also must avoid the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But O is already used in position 2? And S and T must appear at least once? And we are using a 5-letter word.

For the next guess, we want to figure out the positions of S and T and also discover the other letters.

We can try a word that has:
- At position 2: O (because we know it's correct, and including known correct letters helps get the other feedback faster)
- And then try to put S in position 1 and T in position 3? And then we can test others? But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

For example, we try: S O T _ _

But the last two letters we don't know? We can choose an available letter? We have to form a valid word.

Possible word: ""SOTHO""? Wait, what words have S at position 1 and O at position 2? and then T? 

Ideal if we can test S in position 1 and T in position 3? And then the remaining two can be letters we haven't tried? Let's think:

We can use a word that starts with ""SO"" and then has T? Then two new letters? Like ""SOUTH"" but that has U and T H? But U and H are available? But is SOUTH valid? Yes. However, we have T? The feedback: we already know T is in the word? But we can test if T is at position 3? And also test U and H? 

But note: if T is at position 3, then in our guess ""south"", T is at position 4? We want T in position 3? Alternatively, ""sooty""? But that has O repeated? And in our first guess we ruled out O? Actually, O is in the word? We don't know if it's duplicated? Also, we shouldn't repeat? But let's consider:

Another idea: we need to cover positions that we haven't tested. Specifically, for S: we think it might be at 1,3,5. T at 1,3,4.

We can design a guess that tests S in position 1? And T in position 3? So we can try a word: S O T???

But what 5-letter words? Let me think:

Word: ""SOTOL""? Not common? We want common words? Or ""SOULT""? Not a word?

Alternatively, we can try ""SHOUT"", but that has H and U? And we haven't tested T? Actually, ""shout"" has T at last? So:

Position: 
1: S
2: O (correct)
3: H? 
4: U?
5: T

But T is at position 5? We know T is in the word? But note: we cannot put T at position 5? Because in the previous guess, we had T at position 5 and it was marked as wrong position? Meaning T is neither at position 5? Therefore, this guess would fail because we have T at position 5? We already know T isn't at position 5? So if we put T at position 5, the feedback will show it? But we want to use it? Avoid T at position 5? So we cannot use words ending with T? Because we know T is not the last letter? So ""shout"" is invalid? Actually, we can still guess? The feedback would indicate if T is at the last? Which we already know? But we are trying to find T at other positions? Therefore, for efficiency, we avoid T at position 5? Because we already know it's wrong?

Yes, we know T is not at position 5? So we should avoid putting T at position 5? To avoid wasting? Actually, we can still put T at position 5? But it would be marked as wrong? And we already know? So it doesn't give new info? Therefore, we should avoid.

Similarly, we know S is not at position 4? So we avoid S at position 4? And now we want to test S at position 1 or 3 or 5? But if we put S at position 5? We don't know? We can test that? Similarly, T at position 4? We don't know? 

So let's design a word:

- Must have O at position 2.
- S must be at either position 1, 3, or 5? For this guess, let's choose position 1? So first letter S; then O at second; then we can put T at position 3? But we need two more letters? We can pick two new letters? For example, we have B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, U, V, etc? 

Word: ""S O T H Y"" -> ""so thy"" is not a word? ""sothy"" no? 

How about ""S O U T H""? Wait, ""south"" has S at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4, H at 5? But then T is at 4? Which might be tested? Also, we are testing H? Is that good? But word: ""south"" is valid.

Alternatively, we could put S at position 3? So third letter S, and T at position 1? For example, ""TOPSY""? ""topsy""? With T at 1 and S at 4? But position 4? We know S cannot be at 4? Because we tried at 4 in ""moist"" and it was wrong? So we avoid S at 4? So we cannot put S at 4? Therefore, in the word ""topsy"", T at 1, O at 2, P at 3, S at 4? But S at position 4: we already know this is an impossible location? So we cannot use that? Then it's invalid? So avoid S at 4? Therefore, S must be at 1,3 or 5? Therefore, in ""topsy"" if we put S at 4? It's not valid? Actually we know S shouldn't be at 4? So ""topsy"" isn't a good choice? Unless we avoid S at 4? Let's move on.

Another possibility: put S at position 5? For example, ""W O T S?"" Then ""worts""? But ""wort"" is 4 letters? ""worts"" with W at 1, O at 2, R at 3? But R is excluded? R is in excluded? R was in first guess? We had R(x) from ""crane""? So R is not in the word? So we cannot use R? That's important.

So we must also avoid R? So letters we can use: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And O,S,T? But O is at 2? And S and T have to appear? We might use duplicates? But let's avoid for now.

I think we should try to test S at position 1? So:

1: S
2: O
3: ? (cannot be R, A, N, E, M, I, etc. and we haven't tested? We need to test a new letter? Also T? But T might be at position 3? 
4: ? 
5: ? 

But we also want to test T? We know T is in the word? We can try putting T at position 4? Because we don't know about position 4? For T? We can also put T at position 3? But let's try T at position 3? So:

Word: ""S O T"" and then two letters? How about ""S O T H Y""? But ""Sothy"" is not a word? 

Word: ""SOTHY""? Not a word? 

How about ""SOUL T"" -> ""soult"" not a word? 

Another idea: ""STO L K""? ""stolk"" not a word? 

Let's list possible words:

Common word with S at start and O at position 2: ""sound""? But ""sound"" has N? Excluded? Because N(x) from first guess? 

""soppy""? P is new? But ""soppy"" has P? But then T? We don't have T? But we want to test T? How about ""soft y""? ""softy"": 
- Positions: S (1), O (2), F (3), T (4), Y (5)

Let's see:

""soft"":
S at 1: we are testing S in position 1? We currently don't know if it's in 1 or not? 
O at 2: correct
F at 3: new
T at 4: testing T in position 4? Because we have T at 5 in the first guess? Not tested at 4?
Y at 5: new letter?

But note: T is at position 4? We know T cannot be at 5? So let's see if 4 is possible? Also, we know S cannot be at 4? But we haven't tested position 1 for S? So this is valid?

Word: ""softy"" — is it a word? Softy means sentimental? Yes, it is.

So let me use ""softy"" as a candidate: 
- S at position 1? Might be correct or not?
- O at 2: correct
- F at 3: new letter? We don't know? Will be tested?
- T at position 4? Testing if T is at position 4? Given we know T cannot be at 5? So position 4 is possible?
- Y at 5: new?

Also, if S is at position 1? If it gets ✓, then we know. If it gets - or x? Similarly T? 

Therefore, this tests S at position 1 and T at position 4.

But note: if the secret word has T at position 4? Or somewhere else? We don't know? Also, if S is not at 1? Then we have feedback.

Another candidate: we could put T at position 3? For example, ""so th y""? Like ""sothy"" not a word? 

""sooty""? But O is repeated? And we don't know if there are duplicates? Also, O is already at 2? So ""sooty"" has O at 2 and 3: 
- S at 1? Then O at 2, O also at 3? But the secret word might have two O? But we don't know? Also, we have excluded letters? Actually O is in the word? So another O? But the feedback: we saw O only at position 2? In guess 2? So it might be duplicated? 

But let me avoid duplication? For simplicity.

I think ""softy"" is a good candidate? 

But wait: we have a dash for S in the previous guess? How many S are there? We don't know? Could one S be at position 1? 

So I will go with ""softy""

After checking: F and Y? We haven't tried? So we can get feedback on F and Y? And on the position of S and T.

But note: in ""softy"", we have T at position 4? Which might be a candidate? And S at position 1? Also, Y at position 5? What if the secret word doesn't have Y? We will find out.

So I think that's acceptable.

Therefore, next guess: ""softy""

But let me confirm: 
- We avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I? Yes? S,O,F,T,Y? O is used? But O is known? S and T are known? F and Y are new? Good.

But wait: we already know S and T are in the word? So if we put them in new positions? The feedback will show if the position is correct? Specifically:
- If S is at position 1? Then we get ✓? If not, but it's in the word? We get - and then we know it's not at 1? Similarly for T at 4? 

It will help pin down the positions.

So I choose ""softy"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: moist** → Feedback:  
  - ✓ for O at position 2 → **O is confirmed at position 2**.  
  - - for S at position 4 → **S is in the word but not at position 4**.  
  - - for T at position 5 → **T is in the word but not at position 5**.  
  - x for M and I → **M and I are absent** from the word.  

### Constraints for the next guess:
- Secret word format: `_ O _ _ _` (O is fixed at position 2).  
- **Must include S and T** (S ≠ position 4, T ≠ position 5).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.  
- **Possible positions for S**: 1, 3, or 5 (test one to narrow down).  
- **Possible positions for T**: 1, 3, or 4 (test one to narrow down).  
- Preference for common words with untested letters to gain new information.  

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **S at position 1** and **T at position 4** (both untested positions).  
- Include two new untested letters (e.g., F and Y) to maximize feedback.  
- **Chosen word: ""softy""** (valid English word):  
  - Position 1: S (test if S is at 1)  
  - Position 2: O (fixed ✓)  
  - Position 3: F (untested)  
  - Position 4: T (test if T is at 4)  
  - Position 5: Y (untested)  

This guess efficiently narrows S/T positions and checks F/Y for presence/absence.

A strong candidate is **""moist""** because:\n- It uses 5 new letters (M, O, I, S, T), all common in English words.\n- It avoids the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).\n- It includes a vowel (O, I) and high-frequency consonants (S, T, M), maximizing information gain.\n\nThis guess will help identify new correct letters and positions efficiently.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(-) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and feedback:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> all letters are incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So the secret word contains none of these letters.\n\nGuess 2: moist -> Feedback: M(x), O(✓), I(x), S(-), T(-)\n\nInterpretation of guess 2:\n- O is correct and in the correct position. So the secret word has \'O\' as the second letter: _ O _ _ _\n- S is in the word but in the wrong position. But note: the second position is already O, so S cannot be there. The S must be in one of the other positions: 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th? However, wait: the positions are important. The guess is ""m o i s t"", so:\n  Position 1: M -> incorrect (x)\n  Position 2: O -> correct (✓)\n  Position 3: I -> incorrect (x)\n  Position 4: S -> present but wrong position (-)\n  Position 5: T -> present but wrong position (-)\n\nSo the secret word: \n- Must have \'O\' in position 2.\n- Must have \'S\' somewhere, but not in position 4 (since that\'s where it was in the guess and it was marked wrong position). Therefore, S is in position 1, 3, or 5? But note: it could be in position 5? However, we have T also in the wrong position at position 5, so S cannot be at position 5? Actually, it can because feedback doesn\'t specify which one is where. But let\'s think:\n\nImportant: the secret word must contain S and T, but neither is in the position we guessed.\n\nAlso, from guess 1, we know the word does not contain C, R, A, N, E. And from guess 2, M and I are not in the word (since marked x).\n\nSo excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.\n\nWe also know the word contains: O (at position 2), S (somewhere, not position 4), and T (somewhere, not position 5).\n\nPossible positions for S: Since position 2 is fixed as O, S can be in position 1, 3, or 5? But wait: position 1 and 3 are also possibilities? And position 5 is not excluded for S because just because T was at position 5 and marked wrong, it doesn\'t prevent S from being at position 5? Actually, it can be, but note: T is also present and must be in a position other than 5? Similarly, S cannot be in position 4 because that\'s where we guessed and it was wrong.\n\nTherefore:\n- The secret word has O at position 2.\n- It does not have M (so first letter not M) or I (so third letter not I).\n- It has S and T, but S cannot be at position 4 and T cannot be at position 5? Or can S be at position 1? Or position 3? And T can be at position 1, 3, or 4?\n\nBut note: the position of S: we know it is not at position 4 because we put it at position 4 and it was marked as wrong position. Therefore, it must be in one of {1, 3, 5}.\n\nSimilarly, T is not at position 5, so it must be in one of {1, 3, 4}.\n\nBut wait: the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is O.\n\nNow, we need a word that has:\n- O as the second letter\n- Contains S and T (and one more letter? Wait: we have three known letters? O, S, T. But the word is 5 letters so we need two more letters plus O,S,T? Actually, O is one, S and T are two more, so two more letters? And one of the positions is O.\n\nTotal known: O is fixed at position 2. And we know the word has S and T. We also know the word does not have: C,R,A,N,E,M,I. And we have two letters to find? Actually, we don\'t know how many unique letters? The word might have repeated letters? Though with the feedback so far, we have no evidence of duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s assume no duplicates for now? Or we don\'t know.\n\nNow, for our next guess, we need to include the known letters properly and test possible positions.\n\nWe know:\n- Position 2: O\n- The word has S, but not in position 4 (from our guess). Also, since we haven\'t tested position 1,3,5 for S, we can try to test those.\n- The word has T, but not in position 5.\n\nSo possible positions for S: 1, 3, or 5.\nPossible positions for T: 1, 3, or 4? Because position 5 was T and it was marked wrong? So T is not in position 5? Therefore, T must be in 1,3, or 4.\n\nBut note: if we put T in position 1 and S in position 5? Or other combinations.\n\nWe also must avoid the excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But O is already used in position 2? And S and T must appear at least once? And we are using a 5-letter word.\n\nFor the next guess, we want to figure out the positions of S and T and also discover the other letters.\n\nWe can try a word that has:\n- At position 2: O (because we know it\'s correct, and including known correct letters helps get the other feedback faster)\n- And then try to put S in position 1 and T in position 3? And then we can test others? But we have to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nFor example, we try: S O T _ _\n\nBut the last two letters we don\'t know? We can choose an available letter? We have to form a valid word.\n\nPossible word: ""SOTHO""? Wait, what words have S at position 1 and O at position 2? and then T? \n\nIdeal if we can test S in position 1 and T in position 3? And then the remaining two can be letters we haven\'t tried? Let\'s think:\n\nWe can use a word that starts with ""SO"" and then has T? Then two new letters? Like ""SOUTH"" but that has U and T H? But U and H are available? But is SOUTH valid? Yes. However, we have T? The feedback: we already know T is in the word? But we can test if T is at position 3? And also test U and H? \n\nBut note: if T is at position 3, then in our guess ""south"", T is at position 4? We want T in position 3? Alternatively, ""sooty""? But that has O repeated? And in our first guess we ruled out O? Actually, O is in the word? We don\'t know if it\'s duplicated? Also, we shouldn\'t repeat? But let\'s consider:\n\nAnother idea: we need to cover positions that we haven\'t tested. Specifically, for S: we think it might be at 1,3,5. T at 1,3,4.\n\nWe can design a guess that tests S in position 1? And T in position 3? So we can try a word: S O T???\n\nBut what 5-letter words? Let me think:\n\nWord: ""SOTOL""? Not common? We want common words? Or ""SOULT""? Not a word?\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""SHOUT"", but that has H and U? And we haven\'t tested T? Actually, ""shout"" has T at last? So:\n\nPosition: \n1: S\n2: O (correct)\n3: H? \n4: U?\n5: T\n\nBut T is at position 5? We know T is in the word? But note: we cannot put T at position 5? Because in the previous guess, we had T at position 5 and it was marked as wrong position? Meaning T is neither at position 5? Therefore, this guess would fail because we have T at position 5? We already know T isn\'t at position 5? So if we put T at position 5, the feedback will show it? But we want to use it? Avoid T at position 5? So we cannot use words ending with T? Because we know T is not the last letter? So ""shout"" is invalid? Actually, we can still guess? The feedback would indicate if T is at the last? Which we already know? But we are trying to find T at other positions? Therefore, for efficiency, we avoid T at position 5? Because we already know it\'s wrong?\n\nYes, we know T is not at position 5? So we should avoid putting T at position 5? To avoid wasting? Actually, we can still put T at position 5? But it would be marked as wrong? And we already know? So it doesn\'t give new info? Therefore, we should avoid.\n\nSimilarly, we know S is not at position 4? So we avoid S at position 4? And now we want to test S at position 1 or 3 or 5? But if we put S at position 5? We don\'t know? We can test that? Similarly, T at position 4? We don\'t know? \n\nSo let\'s design a word:\n\n- Must have O at position 2.\n- S must be at either position 1, 3, or 5? For this guess, let\'s choose position 1? So first letter S; then O at second; then we can put T at position 3? But we need two more letters? We can pick two new letters? For example, we have B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, U, V, etc? \n\nWord: ""S O T H Y"" -> ""so thy"" is not a word? ""sothy"" no? \n\nHow about ""S O U T H""? Wait, ""south"" has S at 1, O at 2, U at 3, T at 4, H at 5? But then T is at 4? Which might be tested? Also, we are testing H? Is that good? But word: ""south"" is valid.\n\nAlternatively, we could put S at position 3? So third letter S, and T at position 1? For example, ""TOPSY""? ""topsy""? With T at 1 and S at 4? But position 4? We know S cannot be at 4? Because we tried at 4 in ""moist"" and it was wrong? So we avoid S at 4? So we cannot put S at 4? Therefore, in the word ""topsy"", T at 1, O at 2, P at 3, S at 4? But S at position 4: we already know this is an impossible location? So we cannot use that? Then it\'s invalid? So avoid S at 4? Therefore, S must be at 1,3 or 5? Therefore, in ""topsy"" if we put S at 4? It\'s not valid? Actually we know S shouldn\'t be at 4? So ""topsy"" isn\'t a good choice? Unless we avoid S at 4? Let\'s move on.\n\nAnother possibility: put S at position 5? For example, ""W O T S?"" Then ""worts""? But ""wort"" is 4 letters? ""worts"" with W at 1, O at 2, R at 3? But R is excluded? R is in excluded? R was in first guess? We had R(x) from ""crane""? So R is not in the word? So we cannot use R? That\'s important.\n\nSo we must also avoid R? So letters we can use: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z? And O,S,T? But O is at 2? And S and T have to appear? We might use duplicates? But let\'s avoid for now.\n\nI think we should try to test S at position 1? So:\n\n1: S\n2: O\n3: ? (cannot be R, A, N, E, M, I, etc. and we haven\'t tested? We need to test a new letter? Also T? But T might be at position 3? \n4: ? \n5: ? \n\nBut we also want to test T? We know T is in the word? We can try putting T at position 4? Because we don\'t know about position 4? For T? We can also put T at position 3? But let\'s try T at position 3? So:\n\nWord: ""S O T"" and then two letters? How about ""S O T H Y""? But ""Sothy"" is not a word? \n\nWord: ""SOTHY""? Not a word? \n\nHow about ""SOUL T"" -> ""soult"" not a word? \n\nAnother idea: ""STO L K""? ""stolk"" not a word? \n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nCommon word with S at start and O at position 2: ""sound""? But ""sound"" has N? Excluded? Because N(x) from first guess? \n\n""soppy""? P is new? But ""soppy"" has P? But then T? We don\'t have T? But we want to test T? How about ""soft y""? ""softy"": \n- Positions: S (1), O (2), F (3), T (4), Y (5)\n\nLet\'s see:\n\n""soft"":\nS at 1: we are testing S in position 1? We currently don\'t know if it\'s in 1 or not? \nO at 2: correct\nF at 3: new\nT at 4: testing T in position 4? Because we have T at 5 in the first guess? Not tested at 4?\nY at 5: new letter?\n\nBut note: T is at position 4? We know T cannot be at 5? So let\'s see if 4 is possible? Also, we know S cannot be at 4? But we haven\'t tested position 1 for S? So this is valid?\n\nWord: ""softy"" — is it a word? Softy means sentimental? Yes, it is.\n\nSo let me use ""softy"" as a candidate: \n- S at position 1? Might be correct or not?\n- O at 2: correct\n- F at 3: new letter? We don\'t know? Will be tested?\n- T at position 4? Testing if T is at position 4? Given we know T cannot be at 5? So position 4 is possible?\n- Y at 5: new?\n\nAlso, if S is at position 1? If it gets ✓, then we know. If it gets - or x? Similarly T? \n\nTherefore, this tests S at position 1 and T at position 4.\n\nBut note: if the secret word has T at position 4? Or somewhere else? We don\'t know? Also, if S is not at 1? Then we have feedback.\n\nAnother candidate: we could put T at position 3? For example, ""so th y""? Like ""sothy"" not a word? \n\n""sooty""? But O is repeated? And we don\'t know if there are duplicates? Also, O is already at 2? So ""sooty"" has O at 2 and 3: \n- S at 1? Then O at 2, O also at 3? But the secret word might have two O? But we don\'t know? Also, we have excluded letters? Actually O is in the word? So another O? But the feedback: we saw O only at position 2? In guess 2? So it might be duplicated? \n\nBut let me avoid duplication? For simplicity.\n\nI think ""softy"" is a good candidate? \n\nBut wait: we have a dash for S in the previous guess? How many S are there? We don\'t know? Could one S be at position 1? \n\nSo I will go with ""softy""\n\nAfter checking: F and Y? We haven\'t tried? So we can get feedback on F and Y? And on the position of S and T.\n\nBut note: in ""softy"", we have T at position 4? Which might be a candidate? And S at position 1? Also, Y at position 5? What if the secret word doesn\'t have Y? We will find out.\n\nSo I think that\'s acceptable.\n\nTherefore, next guess: ""softy""\n\nBut let me confirm: \n- We avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I? Yes? S,O,F,T,Y? O is used? But O is known? S and T are known? F and Y are new? Good.\n\nBut wait: we already know S and T are in the word? So if we put them in new positions? The feedback will show if the position is correct? Specifically:\n- If S is at position 1? Then we get ✓? If not, but it\'s in the word? We get - and then we know it\'s not at 1? Similarly for T at 4? \n\nIt will help pin down the positions.\n\nSo I choose ""softy"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.  \n- **Guess 2: moist** → Feedback:  \n  - ✓ for O at position 2 → **O is confirmed at position 2**.  \n  - - for S at position 4 → **S is in the word but not at position 4**.  \n  - - for T at position 5 → **T is in the word but not at position 5**.  \n  - x for M and I → **M and I are absent** from the word.  \n\n### Constraints for the next guess:\n- Secret word format: `_ O _ _ _` (O is fixed at position 2).  \n- **Must include S and T** (S ≠ position 4, T ≠ position 5).  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.  \n- **Possible positions for S**: 1, 3, or 5 (test one to narrow down).  \n- **Possible positions for T**: 1, 3, or 4 (test one to narrow down).  \n- Preference for common words with untested letters to gain new information.  \n\n### Strategy for Guess 3:\n- Test **S at position 1** and **T at position 4** (both untested positions).  \n- Include two new untested letters (e.g., F and Y) to maximize feedback.  \n- **Chosen word: ""softy""** (valid English word):  \n  - Position 1: S (test if S is at 1)  \n  - Position 2: O (fixed ✓)  \n  - Position 3: F (untested)  \n  - Position 4: T (test if T is at 4)  \n  - Position 5: Y (untested)  \n\nThis guess efficiently narrows S/T positions and checks F/Y for presence/absence.\n\n<guess>softy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(✓) I(x) S(-) T(-)\nGuess 3: softy -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(✓) Y(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
Guess 2: ""moist"" → 
  M: absent (x)
  O: correct and in position 2 (✓)
  I: absent (x)
  S: present but wrong position (-) → so S is in the word, but not at position 4
  T: present but wrong position (-) → so T is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 3: ""softy"" →
  S: correct and in position 1 (✓) → so the first letter is S
  O: correct and in position 2 (✓) → second letter is O (already known)
  F: absent (x) → F is not in the word
  T: correct and in position 4 (✓) → so the fourth letter is T
  Y: absent (x) → Y is not in the word

Now we know:
- The secret word starts with ""S"" and has ""O"" at position 2 and ""T"" at position 4: so the pattern is ""S O _ T _""
- We also know that the word contains the letter T, but we now have it fixed at position 4, so that's consistent.
- Additionally, from guess 2, we know that T is not at position 5 (which we already have fixed at 4) and S is not at position 4 (now we have it at 1, so that's fine).

We also have more exclusions:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, F, Y (from all three guesses)
- Present letters: S, O, T (with S at 1, O at 2, T at 4)

The word is ""S O _ T _"", and we need to fill the third and fifth positions.

We know the word must have exactly these letters? Not necessarily, because there might be duplicate letters? But so far, we have no indication of duplicates. However, we must consider that the word might have another S, O, or T? But let's see.

We have:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: T

So positions 3 and 5 are unknown.

We also know that from guess 2, we had S and T present (and now we know their positions) and O was correct. But in guess 2, we had no other correct positions? So the word has at least S, O, T.

But what about the third and fifth letters? They must be letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, F, Y.

Available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others? But note: we have used S, O, T, so we can use any of the available ones).

We need to form a word of the form ""S O ? T ?""

We also know that in guess 2, we had ""moist"" and S was present but not at position 4 (which we now know is because it was at position 1) and T was present but not at position 5 (now we know it's at 4). So that doesn't give new info for positions 3 and 5.

Now, for the next guess, we need to guess a word that fits the pattern and uses available letters to test the missing positions.

We have two positions to fill: 3 and 5.

We can try to think of common words that fit ""S O _ T _""

Common words:
- ""SOUTH"" → but H is available? But we have excluded? Let's check: ""SOUTH"" has S, O, U, T, H. We know U and H are not excluded? But in the fifth position? However, we have to check if it's valid? But note: in guess 1, we had E excluded, so not ""south"" because of U and H? But U and H are not excluded? Excluded are C,R,A,N,E,M,I,F,Y. So U and H are allowed.

But wait: ""south"" has the pattern: S(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5). So that would be a candidate? But we don't know if U and H are in the word? We can guess it? But we are not sure? We need to test.

Another common word: ""SOFTY"" we already tried? And we got F and Y absent? So not that.

""SPLIT""? But P and L? But we have pattern: S, O, P, T? Then what? ""SOPT?"" not a word? 

""SPOUT""? S, P, O, U, T? But that would be S(1), P(2)? But we need O at 2? So not.

We need O at position 2? So ""S O _ T _""

Other words: 
- ""SOUTH"" as above.
- ""SOOTY"" → but O repeated? And Y is excluded? We know Y is absent? So not.
- ""SOUTH"" is one.
- ""SOFTY"" we tried? Not.
- ""SORTY""? But R is excluded? And Y excluded? Not.
- ""SOUTH"" seems a good candidate? But let's see if there are others.

""SOUTH"" uses U and H? Both are not excluded? And we haven't tested them? So if we guess ""south"", we can get feedback on U and H? And also confirm the pattern? But we already know S, O, T are fixed? So if we guess ""south"", then:
- Position 3: U → if it's correct? Then we get ✓? If not, then we know U is not in the word? Similarly, position 5: H → if correct? Then we get ✓? If not, then H is absent? Or present but wrong? But since it's the fifth position? We can get feedback.

But note: the word might not be ""south""? We have to consider other possibilities.

Another word: ""SOUTH"" is one possibility? What about ""SOFTY""? We tried and it didn't work? Because F and Y were absent? So not.

""SOOTY"" is invalid because of O repeated and Y absent? 

""SPLIT"" doesn't fit? Because we need O at 2? 

""SHOUT""? But that would be S, H, O, U, T? So pattern: S(1), H(2)? But we need O at 2? So not.

We must have O at 2? So the word must be ""S O ? T ?""

Other words: 
- ""SOUTH"" (as above)
- ""SOUTH"" is the only common one? 
- ""SOFTY"" we tried? Not.
- ""SOOTE""? Not a word? 
- ""SOUTH"" is the most common.

But what about ""SOUL T""? ""soult"" not a word? 

""SOULT"" not in dictionary? 

""SOUTH"" is valid.

Another one: ""SOUTH"" or ""SOOTY"" (invalid) or ""SOUTH"" is the best.

But we have to consider: the fifth letter? We know T is at 4? So the fifth letter must be a letter that can form a word? 

We can also think of ""SOFTY"" we tried? Not.

Another word: ""SOUTH"" or ""SOUTH"" is the only common one? 

But what about ""SOUTH"" with H? Or ""SOUT"" with something? 

""SOUTH"" is 5 letters? Yes.

But we have to check if U and H are available? Yes, not excluded.

So I think ""south"" is a good guess? But let's see: if we guess ""south"", then:

- S at 1: we know it's correct? So ✓
- O at 2: ✓
- U at 3: we don't know? If it's correct? Then ✓? If not, then we get feedback? 
- T at 4: ✓
- H at 5: we don't know? 

But note: we know T is at 4? So if the word is ""south"", then H at 5? But we don't know? 

Alternatively, the word might be ""SOUTH"" or it might be another word? For example, ""SOFTY"" we know is not? Because F and Y absent? 

What other words? ""SOULS""? But that has S at the end? And we have T at 4? Not? 

""SOUPS""? But P and S? Pattern: S, O, U, P, S? But then position 4 is P? But we need T at 4? So not? 

""SOUTH"" is the only common word that fits? 

But we have to consider: the word might have a different letter at 3 and 5? For example, ""SOUTH"" has U and H? But there might be others? 

For example: 
- ""SOUTH"" 
- ""SOUTH"" is the only one? 

What about ""SOOTY""? Not? Because O repeated and Y excluded? 

""SOUTH"" is the word? 

But we are not sure? We need to guess? 

Alternatively, we can think of other words? 

""SOUTH"" or ""SOUTH"" is the main one? 

Another: ""SOUTH"" or ""SOUT"" with H? 

I think ""south"" is a valid guess? 

But let me confirm the pattern: S O _ T _ 

With the third and fifth to be filled? 

Words: 
- SOUTH: S O U T H → so third is U, fifth is H? 
- Is there ""S O W T H""? ""sowth"" not a word? 
- ""S O L T H""? ""solth"" not a word? 
- ""S O P T H""? not a word? 
- ""S O G T H""? not? 
- ""S O B T H""? not? 

So ""SOUTH"" is the only common word? 

But what about ""SOFTY""? We tried? Not. 

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""SOUTH""? 

But we have to guess? 

In the feedback, we have: 

Guess 3: ""softy"" → S(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(✓) Y(x) → so we know the word is ""S O _ T _"", and F and Y are absent? 

Now, for the next guess, we can guess ""south"" to test? 

But note: we have only 6 guesses? We are at guess 4? 

If we guess ""south"", and it's correct? Then we win? 

If not, then we get feedback? 

But what if the word is not ""south""? Then we need to think of other words? 

But from the available letters? We have to form a word? 

Another word: ""SOUTH"" is the only common one? 

But let me think: are there other words? 

For example: 
- ""SOUTH"" 
- ""SOUTH"" is the word? 

What about ""SOUT"" with a different ending? 

""SOUT"" is not 5 letters? 

""SOUTH"" is the only one? 

But we have ""SOUTH"" and ""SOUTH"" is the word? 

Perhaps ""SOUTH"" is the answer? 

But we have to consider: the fifth letter? We know T is at 4? So the fifth letter must be a consonant? Or vowel? 

We can also consider: in the first guess, we had no E? So the word has no E? 

In the second guess, we had no I? 

In the third, no F or Y? 

So for position 5? It must be a letter not excluded? 

Available: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? 

And for position 3? Same? 

Now, what words are there? 

""SOUTH"" uses U and H? 

Another word: ""SOUL"" is 4 letters? 

""SOUND"" but N is excluded? 

""SOUPY"" but Y excluded? 

""SOURS"" but S repeated? And R excluded? 

""SOUTH"" is the only common word? 

Therefore, I think we should guess ""south"" for the next guess? 

But let me double-check: 

Secret word pattern: S O _ T _ 

With the third and fifth letters from the available set? 

And ""SOUTH"" is a valid English word? 

Yes? 

So I will go with ""south"" as the next guess? 

But note: we have to output in lowercase? 

So <guess>south</guess> 

But we are at guess 4? 

If it's correct? Then we are done? If not? We get feedback? 

But I think it's the most likely? 

Alternatively, to be safe? We could guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions? And we have to fill them? 

We can guess ""south"" to test both? 

Yes? 

So I think that's the best? 

Therefore, next guess: ""south""

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent.  
- **Guess 2: moist** →  
  - O is **correct at position 2** (✓).  
  - S is **present but wrong position** (-), so S is in the word but not at position 4.  
  - T is **present but wrong position** (-), so T is in the word but not at position 5.  
  - M and I are absent (x).  
- **Guess 3: softy** →  
  - S is **correct at position 1** (✓).  
  - O is **correct at position 2** (✓).  
  - T is **correct at position 4** (✓).  
  - F and Y are absent (x).  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `S O _ T _` (positions 1, 2, and 4 are fixed as S, O, T).  
- **Confirmed letters**: S, O, T.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, F, Y (absent from all guesses).  
- **Unknown positions**: 3 and 5.  
- **Available letters**: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (not yet tested or excluded).  

### Strategy for Guess 4:
- The secret word must be a valid 5-letter word fitting `S O _ T _`.  
- **""SOUTH""** is a strong candidate:  
  - Matches the pattern: `S` (pos 1), `O` (pos 2), `U` (pos 3), `T` (pos 4), `H` (pos 5).  
  - Uses `U` and `H` (untested letters), providing new information.  
  - Common English word, consistent with constraints.  
- If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback on `U` and `H` will reveal their status (e.g., if `U` or `H` is present/absent or in the wrong position).  

<guess>south</guess>",south,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" → all letters absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
Guess 2: ""moist"" → 
  M: absent (x)
  O: correct and in position 2 (✓)
  I: absent (x)
  S: present but wrong position (-) → so S is in the word, but not at position 4
  T: present but wrong position (-) → so T is in the word, but not at position 5

Guess 3: ""softy"" →
  S: correct and in position 1 (✓) → so the first letter is S
  O: correct and in position 2 (✓) → second letter is O (already known)
  F: absent (x) → F is not in the word
  T: correct and in position 4 (✓) → so the fourth letter is T
  Y: absent (x) → Y is not in the word

Now we know:
- The secret word starts with ""S"" and has ""O"" at position 2 and ""T"" at position 4: so the pattern is ""S O _ T _""
- We also know that the word contains the letter T, but we now have it fixed at position 4, so that's consistent.
- Additionally, from guess 2, we know that T is not at position 5 (which we already have fixed at 4) and S is not at position 4 (now we have it at 1, so that's fine).

We also have more exclusions:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, F, Y (from all three guesses)
- Present letters: S, O, T (with S at 1, O at 2, T at 4)

The word is ""S O _ T _"", and we need to fill the third and fifth positions.

We know the word must have exactly these letters? Not necessarily, because there might be duplicate letters? But so far, we have no indication of duplicates. However, we must consider that the word might have another S, O, or T? But let's see.

We have:
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: O
- Position 4: T

So positions 3 and 5 are unknown.

We also know that from guess 2, we had S and T present (and now we know their positions) and O was correct. But in guess 2, we had no other correct positions? So the word has at least S, O, T.

But what about the third and fifth letters? They must be letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, F, Y.

Available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (and possibly others? But note: we have used S, O, T, so we can use any of the available ones).

We need to form a word of the form ""S O ? T ?""

We also know that in guess 2, we had ""moist"" and S was present but not at position 4 (which we now know is because it was at position 1) and T was present but not at position 5 (now we know it's at 4). So that doesn't give new info for positions 3 and 5.

Now, for the next guess, we need to guess a word that fits the pattern and uses available letters to test the missing positions.

We have two positions to fill: 3 and 5.

We can try to think of common words that fit ""S O _ T _""

Common words:
- ""SOUTH"" → but H is available? But we have excluded? Let's check: ""SOUTH"" has S, O, U, T, H. We know U and H are not excluded? But in the fifth position? However, we have to check if it's valid? But note: in guess 1, we had E excluded, so not ""south"" because of U and H? But U and H are not excluded? Excluded are C,R,A,N,E,M,I,F,Y. So U and H are allowed.

But wait: ""south"" has the pattern: S(1), O(2), U(3), T(4), H(5). So that would be a candidate? But we don't know if U and H are in the word? We can guess it? But we are not sure? We need to test.

Another common word: ""SOFTY"" we already tried? And we got F and Y absent? So not that.

""SPLIT""? But P and L? But we have pattern: S, O, P, T? Then what? ""SOPT?"" not a word? 

""SPOUT""? S, P, O, U, T? But that would be S(1), P(2)? But we need O at 2? So not.

We need O at position 2? So ""S O _ T _""

Other words: 
- ""SOUTH"" as above.
- ""SOOTY"" → but O repeated? And Y is excluded? We know Y is absent? So not.
- ""SOUTH"" is one.
- ""SOFTY"" we tried? Not.
- ""SORTY""? But R is excluded? And Y excluded? Not.
- ""SOUTH"" seems a good candidate? But let's see if there are others.

""SOUTH"" uses U and H? Both are not excluded? And we haven't tested them? So if we guess ""south"", we can get feedback on U and H? And also confirm the pattern? But we already know S, O, T are fixed? So if we guess ""south"", then:
- Position 3: U → if it's correct? Then we get ✓? If not, then we know U is not in the word? Similarly, position 5: H → if correct? Then we get ✓? If not, then H is absent? Or present but wrong? But since it's the fifth position? We can get feedback.

But note: the word might not be ""south""? We have to consider other possibilities.

Another word: ""SOUTH"" is one possibility? What about ""SOFTY""? We tried and it didn't work? Because F and Y were absent? So not.

""SOOTY"" is invalid because of O repeated and Y absent? 

""SPLIT"" doesn't fit? Because we need O at 2? 

""SHOUT""? But that would be S, H, O, U, T? So pattern: S(1), H(2)? But we need O at 2? So not.

We must have O at 2? So the word must be ""S O ? T ?""

Other words: 
- ""SOUTH"" (as above)
- ""SOUTH"" is the only common one? 
- ""SOFTY"" we tried? Not.
- ""SOOTE""? Not a word? 
- ""SOUTH"" is the most common.

But what about ""SOUL T""? ""soult"" not a word? 

""SOULT"" not in dictionary? 

""SOUTH"" is valid.

Another one: ""SOUTH"" or ""SOOTY"" (invalid) or ""SOUTH"" is the best.

But we have to consider: the fifth letter? We know T is at 4? So the fifth letter must be a letter that can form a word? 

We can also think of ""SOFTY"" we tried? Not.

Another word: ""SOUTH"" or ""SOUTH"" is the only common one? 

But what about ""SOUTH"" with H? Or ""SOUT"" with something? 

""SOUTH"" is 5 letters? Yes.

But we have to check if U and H are available? Yes, not excluded.

So I think ""south"" is a good guess? But let's see: if we guess ""south"", then:

- S at 1: we know it's correct? So ✓
- O at 2: ✓
- U at 3: we don't know? If it's correct? Then ✓? If not, then we get feedback? 
- T at 4: ✓
- H at 5: we don't know? 

But note: we know T is at 4? So if the word is ""south"", then H at 5? But we don't know? 

Alternatively, the word might be ""SOUTH"" or it might be another word? For example, ""SOFTY"" we know is not? Because F and Y absent? 

What other words? ""SOULS""? But that has S at the end? And we have T at 4? Not? 

""SOUPS""? But P and S? Pattern: S, O, U, P, S? But then position 4 is P? But we need T at 4? So not? 

""SOUTH"" is the only common word that fits? 

But we have to consider: the word might have a different letter at 3 and 5? For example, ""SOUTH"" has U and H? But there might be others? 

For example: 
- ""SOUTH"" 
- ""SOUTH"" is the only one? 

What about ""SOOTY""? Not? Because O repeated and Y excluded? 

""SOUTH"" is the word? 

But we are not sure? We need to guess? 

Alternatively, we can think of other words? 

""SOUTH"" or ""SOUTH"" is the main one? 

Another: ""SOUTH"" or ""SOUT"" with H? 

I think ""south"" is a valid guess? 

But let me confirm the pattern: S O _ T _ 

With the third and fifth to be filled? 

Words: 
- SOUTH: S O U T H → so third is U, fifth is H? 
- Is there ""S O W T H""? ""sowth"" not a word? 
- ""S O L T H""? ""solth"" not a word? 
- ""S O P T H""? not a word? 
- ""S O G T H""? not? 
- ""S O B T H""? not? 

So ""SOUTH"" is the only common word? 

But what about ""SOFTY""? We tried? Not. 

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""SOUTH""? 

But we have to guess? 

In the feedback, we have: 

Guess 3: ""softy"" → S(✓) O(✓) F(x) T(✓) Y(x) → so we know the word is ""S O _ T _"", and F and Y are absent? 

Now, for the next guess, we can guess ""south"" to test? 

But note: we have only 6 guesses? We are at guess 4? 

If we guess ""south"", and it's correct? Then we win? 

If not, then we get feedback? 

But what if the word is not ""south""? Then we need to think of other words? 

But from the available letters? We have to form a word? 

Another word: ""SOUTH"" is the only common one? 

But let me think: are there other words? 

For example: 
- ""SOUTH"" 
- ""SOUTH"" is the word? 

What about ""SOUT"" with a different ending? 

""SOUT"" is not 5 letters? 

""SOUTH"" is the only one? 

But we have ""SOUTH"" and ""SOUTH"" is the word? 

Perhaps ""SOUTH"" is the answer? 

But we have to consider: the fifth letter? We know T is at 4? So the fifth letter must be a consonant? Or vowel? 

We can also consider: in the first guess, we had no E? So the word has no E? 

In the second guess, we had no I? 

In the third, no F or Y? 

So for position 5? It must be a letter not excluded? 

Available: B, D, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z? 

And for position 3? Same? 

Now, what words are there? 

""SOUTH"" uses U and H? 

Another word: ""SOUL"" is 4 letters? 

""SOUND"" but N is excluded? 

""SOUPY"" but Y excluded? 

""SOURS"" but S repeated? And R excluded? 

""SOUTH"" is the only common word? 

Therefore, I think we should guess ""south"" for the next guess? 

But let me double-check: 

Secret word pattern: S O _ T _ 

With the third and fifth letters from the available set? 

And ""SOUTH"" is a valid English word? 

Yes? 

So I will go with ""south"" as the next guess? 

But note: we have to output in lowercase? 

So <guess>south</guess> 

But we are at guess 4? 

If it's correct? Then we are done? If not? We get feedback? 

But I think it's the most likely? 

Alternatively, to be safe? We could guess a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we only have two positions? And we have to fill them? 

We can guess ""south"" to test both? 

Yes? 

So I think that's the best? 

Therefore, next guess: ""south""### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
