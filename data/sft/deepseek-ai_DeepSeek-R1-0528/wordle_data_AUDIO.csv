We are making our first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that maximizes information.
 The ideal starting words often have unique letters and include common letters to cover possibilities.

 Commonly used starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""TRACE"". Let's choose one that has five distinct letters and covers common vowels and consonants.

 I choose ""SLATE"". It contains:
   S, L, A, T, E
 These are all common letters.

 So the first guess is ""SLATE"".

I am playing the Wordle game and need to make my first guess. There's no prior feedback, so I must choose a starting word strategically.
The best starting words typically:
- Use common English letters (like E, A, R, T, S) to maximize information gain
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities
- Are actual English words

I selected ""CRATE"" as my first guess because:
- It contains five distinct letters: C, R, A, T, E
- It uses very common letters (E and A are the two most common vowels; T and R are common consonants)
- ""CRATE"" is a valid English word (a noun/verb meaning a storage container)

This choice will help me get feedback on:
- Whether any of these letters are present in the secret word
- Possible positions for correct letters

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRATE"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  T: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since it was in the 3rd position in CRATE and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, T, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position, and does not contain C, R, T, or E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position (not 3rd).
- Avoids the letters C, R, T, E (since they are not in the word).
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be in position 3, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to cover new common letters. Since we haven't tried many letters, we can try to include other vowels (like O, I, U) and common consonants (like S, N, L, D, etc.).

Let's think of words that have A in a position other than 3 and avoid C, R, T, E.

Some common letters we haven't tried: S, O, L, I, N, D, H, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A and some of these.

Example words:
- SALON: has A in position 2 (which is allowed) and uses S, L, O, N (all new letters). But note: we don't know if these are in the word, but we want to test.
- However, we must avoid C, R, T, E.

But wait: we know A is in the word, so we should definitely include it. Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since A is the only known letter, we can try to put it in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.

Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, T, E:

- Starting with A: ABLE, ABYSS (but ABYSS is 5 letters? ABYSS is 5: A-B-Y-S-S, but has duplicate S and Y is less common). Maybe not ideal.
- A in position 1: How about ""ALIEN""? But E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

We must avoid E, so words with E are out.

So, let's think of words without C, R, T, E and with A in a position other than 3.

Possible words:
- A in position 1: ALOUD, ALOFT (but T is not allowed), ALONG (G is new), ALOHA (has H and O, but duplicate A? ALOHA: A-L-O-H-A, so two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we only know one A is present, so it might be safe to use, but we don't want to waste a guess on duplicate if not necessary). Alternatively, ""ANVIL"" (A in 1, but V is less common).

- A in position 2: SALAD (duplicate A and D, but D is new), but we can do better. How about ""PLAIN""? P, L, I, N are new. But we must avoid E? Yes, and PLAIN has no E, C, R, T? It has P, L, A, I, N. All new and allowed. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAIN: P-L-A-I-N -> A is in position 3? But we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not there? Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So in our new guess, we can put A in a different position to test. In PLAIN, A is in position 3, which is the same as before? We should avoid position 3 for A because we already know it's not there. So putting A in position 3 again would be a waste because we know it's not correct. We want to try A in a new position to get more information.

Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

In PLAIN, A is in position 3, so that's not good.

What about ""BASIC""? But C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So we cannot use C.

Another word: ""MANIA""? M, A, N, I, A. But duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 5. But we don't know if there are two A's. Also, we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. But let's see: M, A, N, I, A. We can try.

But perhaps we can do better with a word that has A in a position we haven't tried (like 1, 2, 4, or 5) and uses common letters.

How about ""SALAD""? S-A-L-A-D. A is in position 2 and 4. But we know at least one A is present, so if we get a '-' for both, we know there are two? But we are trying to get information. However, duplicate letters might complicate.

Alternatively, ""PLAID"": P-L-A-I-D. A is in position 3 again? Same problem.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

Let me try to find words with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

- Position 1: ALONG, ALIGN, AISLE (but E is not allowed), ALBUM (B, U, M). ALBUM: A-L-B-U-M. That uses L, B, U, M. All new. And A in position 1.

- Position 2: BLAND (but D is new, but A in position 3? B-L-A-N-D -> A is in position 3, which we want to avoid). So not good.

  How about ""PAINT""? But T is not allowed.

  Or ""DAISY"": D-A-I-S-Y. A in position 2. And D, I, S, Y are new. And no forbidden letters? D, A, I, S, Y. Yes, no C, R, T, E.

- Position 4: We can try words like ""FINAL"" (F-I-N-A-L) -> A in position 4. But we have F, I, N, A, L. All new.

- Position 5: ""PIZZA"" (duplicate Z, and Z is rare), or ""JUMBA""? Not common. ""COMA"" is 4 letters. ""GUAVA"" has duplicate A and V, and G, U, V.

Considering the above, I think ""DAISY"" and ""FINAL"" are good candidates.

But we also want to cover more common letters. The most common letters left are S, O, L, N, D, I, etc.

""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> includes S and I, which are common. And Y is less common but acceptable.

""FINAL"": F, I, N, A, L -> includes I, N, L, which are common. F is less common.

Another option: ""BASIS""? But S is repeated and A is in position 2? B-A-S-I-S. A in position 2. But duplicate S. And B is new.

But we don't know if duplicate letters are in the word, so it might be okay, but we might get less information.

Alternatively, ""PLAIN"" is not good because A is in position 3.

I think ""DAISY"" is a good choice because:
- A is in position 2 (a new position)
- It uses D, I, S, Y (all new letters, and S and I are very common)
- It avoids C, R, T, E.

Another candidate: ""OASIS"" but O is new, but duplicate S and A in position 2? O-A-S-I-S. But we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. But duplicate S.

I think ""DAISY"" is better because it has all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""ALONG"" is also distinct: A, L, O, N, G. But A is in position 1, which is a new position. And it uses L, O, N, G.

But ""DAISY"" has S and Y, while ""ALONG"" has O and G. S is more common than G and O? Actually, S is the most common consonant.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""PAINS"" but P, A, I, N, S. A is in position 2? P-A-I-N-S. But we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. And distinct letters. But we don't have P in the feedback yet.

But note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are absent (C, R, T, E).

I think both ""DAISY"" and ""PAINS"" are good. But ""PAINS"" has A in position 2 and uses P, A, I, N, S.

But let me compare:

- ""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> tests D, I, S, Y and A in position 2.
- ""PAINS"": P, A, I, N, S -> tests P, A, I, N, S and A in position 2.

""PAINS"" uses more common letters: P, I, N, S are all in the top 20. D is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than D? According to letter frequency, S is very common, then N, I, P, then D.

But both are valid.

Another word: ""MAINS"" (like water mains) but M, A, I, N, S. A in position 2.

But I think ""PAINS"" is a word? Yes, as in ""he pains himself"".

But to have a more common word, how about ""PLANS""? But L is new, and A in position 3? P-L-A-N-S -> A in position 3, which we want to avoid.

So not good.

""SAUNA"": S-A-U-N-A. A in position 2 and 5, but duplicate A and U is less common.

I think ""PAINS"" is a good choice because it has common letters and distinct.

But let me check: we know A is in the word, so if we put A in position 2 and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's not in position 2. Also, we test P, I, N, S.

Similarly, ""DAISY"" tests D, I, S, Y.

But Y is less common, so ""PAINS"" might be better.

However, we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, T, E. Both words avoid them.

I'll go with ""PAINS"" because it has more common letters (P, I, N, S) and A in a new position (2).

But wait, in the first guess, A was in position 3. Now we are trying position 2. That's good.

Alternatively, we could try A in position 1: like ""ALIGN"" (A-L-I-G-N). But G is less common.

Or ""ADMIN"" (A-D-M-I-N) -> A in 1, and D, M, I, N.

But I think ""PAINS"" is fine.

Another top candidate: ""SPAIN"" but S-P-A-I-N -> A in position 3? S(1)-P(2)-A(3)-I(4)-N(5). So A is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid.

Therefore, ""PAINS"" with A in position 2 is better.

But note: ""PAINS"" is a valid word? Yes, as a noun or verb.

So, I choose ""PAINS"".

But let me confirm: P-A-I-N-S. Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S.

We are testing A in position 2.

If we get a ✓ for A, then we know A is in position 2. If we get a '-', then A is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already know not in 3, so it must be in 1,4, or5). If we get an 'x' for A, that would be impossible because we know A is in the word. So we should get either ✓ or - for A.

Similarly, we get feedback on P, I, N, S.

This will give us good information.

So, second guess: PAINS.
</think>
<thought>
We have feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"": 
- C(x), R(x), A(-), T(x), E(x)

This tells us:
- The letter A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position (since it received a '-').
- The letters C, R, T, and E are not in the secret word at all.

For the second guess, we need to:
1. Include the letter A (since it's confirmed to be in the word) but avoid placing it in the 3rd position again.
2. Avoid using C, R, T, or E (as they are absent).
3. Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, I, N, P, L, O, D).
4. Prefer a word with distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

After evaluating options:
- ""PAINS"" is a valid 5-letter word that meets these criteria:
  - It places A in position 2 (a new position to test).
  - It uses new common letters: P, I, N, S (all untested and common in English).
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, T, E).
  - All letters are distinct, increasing information potential.

This guess will help us:
- Confirm if A is in position 2 (✓ or -).
- Test the presence of P, I, N, S in the word.
- Narrow down possible positions for A if it's not in position 2.
</thought>

<guess>PAINS</guess>",PAINS,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRATE"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since it was in the 3rd position in CRATE and got a '-' meaning wrong position).

""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> includes S and I, which are common. And Y is less common but acceptable.

""FINAL"": F, I, N, A, L -> includes I, N, L, which are common. F is less common.

Another option: ""BASIS""? But S is repeated and A is in position 2? B-A-S-I-S. A in position 2. But duplicate S. And B is new.

But we don't know if duplicate letters are in the word, so it might be okay, but we might get less information.

Alternatively, ""PLAIN"" is not good because A is in position 3.

I think ""DAISY"" is a good choice because:
- A is in position 2 (a new position)
- It uses D, I, S, Y (all new letters, and S and I are very common)
- It avoids C, R, T, E.

Another candidate: ""OASIS"" but O is new, but duplicate S and A in position 2? O-A-S-I-S. But we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. But duplicate S.

I think ""DAISY"" is better because it has all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""ALONG"" is also distinct: A, L, O, N, G. But A is in position 1, which is a new position. And it uses L, O, N, G.

But ""DAISY"" has S and Y, while ""ALONG"" has O and G. S is more common than G and O? Actually, S is the most common consonant.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""PAINS"" but P, A, I, N, S. A is in position 2? P-A-I-N-S. But we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. And distinct letters. But we don't have P in the feedback yet.

But note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are absent (C, R, T, E).

I think both ""DAISY"" and ""PAINS"" are good. But ""PAINS"" has A in position 2 and uses P, A, I, N, S.

But let me compare:

- ""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> tests D, I, S, Y and A in position 2.
- ""PAINS"": P, A, I, N, S -> tests P, A, I, N, S and A in position 2.

""PAINS"" uses more common letters: P, I, N, S are all in the top 20. D is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than D? According to letter frequency, S is very common, then N, I, P, then D.

But both are valid.

Another word: ""MAINS"" (like water mains) but M, A, I, N, S. A in position 2.

But I think ""PAINS"" is a word? Yes, as in ""he pains himself"".

But to have a more common word, how about ""PLANS""? But L is new, and A in position 3? P-L-A-N-S -> A in position 3, which we want to avoid.

So not good.

""SAUNA"": S-A-U-N-A. A in position 2 and 5, but duplicate A and U is less common.

I think ""PAINS"" is a good choice because it has common letters and distinct.

But let me check: we know A is in the word, so if we put A in position 2 and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's not in position 2. Also, we test P, I, N, S.

Similarly, ""DAISY"" tests D, I, S, Y.

But Y is less common, so ""PAINS"" might be better.

However, we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, T, E. Both words avoid them.

I'll go with ""PAINS"" because it has more common letters (P, I, N, S) and A in a new position (2).

But wait, in the first guess, A was in position 3. Now we are trying position 2. That's good.

Alternatively, we could try A in position 1: like ""ALIGN"" (A-L-I-G-N). But G is less common.

Or ""ADMIN"" (A-D-M-I-N) -> A in 1, and D, M, I, N.

But I think ""PAINS"" is fine.

Another top candidate: ""SPAIN"" but S-P-A-I-N -> A in position 3? S(1)-P(2)-A(3)-I(4)-N(5). So A is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid.

Therefore, ""PAINS"" with A in position 2 is better.

But note: ""PAINS"" is a valid word? Yes, as a noun or verb.

So, I choose ""PAINS"".

But let me confirm: P-A-I-N-S. Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S.

We are testing A in position 2.

If we get a ✓ for A, then we know A is in position 2. If we get a '-', then A is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already know not in 3, so it must be in 1,4, or5). If we get an 'x' for A, that would be impossible because we know A is in the word. So we should get either ✓ or - for A.

Similarly, we get feedback on P, I, N, S.

This will give us good information.

So, second guess: PAINS.<thought>
We have feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"": 
- C(x), R(x), A(-), T(x), E(x)

This tells us:
- The letter A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position (since it received a '-').
- The letters C, R, T, and E are not in the secret word at all.

For the second guess, we need to:
1. Include the letter A (since it's confirmed to be in the word) but avoid placing it in the 3rd position again.
2. Avoid using C, R, T, or E (as they are absent).
3. Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, I, N, P, L, O, D).
4. Prefer a word with distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

After evaluating options:
- ""PAINS"" is a valid 5-letter word that meets these criteria:
  - It places A in position 2 (a new position to test).
  - It uses new common letters: P, I, N, S (all untested and common in English).
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, T, E).
  - All letters are distinct, increasing information potential.

This guess will help us:
- Confirm if A is in position 2 (✓ or -).
- Test the presence of P, I, N, S in the word.
- Narrow down possible positions for A if it's not in position 2.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that maximizes information.
 The ideal starting words often have unique letters and include common letters to cover possibilities.

 Commonly used starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""TRACE"". Let's choose one that has five distinct letters and covers common vowels and consonants.

 I choose ""SLATE"". It contains:
   S, L, A, T, E
 These are all common letters.

 So the first guess is ""SLATE"".<thought>
I am playing the Wordle game and need to make my first guess. There's no prior feedback, so I must choose a starting word strategically.
The best starting words typically:
- Use common English letters (like E, A, R, T, S) to maximize information gain
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities
- Are actual English words

I selected ""CRATE"" as my first guess because:
- It contains five distinct letters: C, R, A, T, E
- It uses very common letters (E and A are the two most common vowels; T and R are common consonants)
- ""CRATE"" is a valid English word (a noun/verb meaning a storage container)

This choice will help me get feedback on:
- Whether any of these letters are present in the secret word
- Possible positions for correct letters
</thought>

<guess>CRATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRATE"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  T: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since it was in the 3rd position in CRATE and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, T, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position, and does not contain C, R, T, or E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position (not 3rd).
- Avoids the letters C, R, T, E (since they are not in the word).
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be in position 3, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to cover new common letters. Since we haven't tried many letters, we can try to include other vowels (like O, I, U) and common consonants (like S, N, L, D, etc.).

Let's think of words that have A in a position other than 3 and avoid C, R, T, E.

Some common letters we haven't tried: S, O, L, I, N, D, H, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A and some of these.

Example words:
- SALON: has A in position 2 (which is allowed) and uses S, L, O, N (all new letters). But note: we don't know if these are in the word, but we want to test.
- However, we must avoid C, R, T, E.

But wait: we know A is in the word, so we should definitely include it. Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since A is the only known letter, we can try to put it in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.

Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, T, E:

- Starting with A: ABLE, ABYSS (but ABYSS is 5 letters? ABYSS is 5: A-B-Y-S-S, but has duplicate S and Y is less common). Maybe not ideal.
- A in position 1: How about ""ALIEN""? But E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

We must avoid E, so words with E are out.

So, let's think of words without C, R, T, E and with A in a position other than 3.

Possible words:
- A in position 1: ALOUD, ALOFT (but T is not allowed), ALONG (G is new), ALOHA (has H and O, but duplicate A? ALOHA: A-L-O-H-A, so two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we only know one A is present, so it might be safe to use, but we don't want to waste a guess on duplicate if not necessary). Alternatively, ""ANVIL"" (A in 1, but V is less common).

- A in position 2: SALAD (duplicate A and D, but D is new), but we can do better. How about ""PLAIN""? P, L, I, N are new. But we must avoid E? Yes, and PLAIN has no E, C, R, T? It has P, L, A, I, N. All new and allowed. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAIN: P-L-A-I-N -> A is in position 3? But we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not there? Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So in our new guess, we can put A in a different position to test. In PLAIN, A is in position 3, which is the same as before? We should avoid position 3 for A because we already know it's not there. So putting A in position 3 again would be a waste because we know it's not correct. We want to try A in a new position to get more information.

Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

In PLAIN, A is in position 3, so that's not good.

What about ""BASIC""? But C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So we cannot use C.

Another word: ""MANIA""? M, A, N, I, A. But duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 5. But we don't know if there are two A's. Also, we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. But let's see: M, A, N, I, A. We can try.

But perhaps we can do better with a word that has A in a position we haven't tried (like 1, 2, 4, or 5) and uses common letters.

How about ""SALAD""? S-A-L-A-D. A is in position 2 and 4. But we know at least one A is present, so if we get a '-' for both, we know there are two? But we are trying to get information. However, duplicate letters might complicate.

Alternatively, ""PLAID"": P-L-A-I-D. A is in position 3 again? Same problem.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

Let me try to find words with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

- Position 1: ALONG, ALIGN, AISLE (but E is not allowed), ALBUM (B, U, M). ALBUM: A-L-B-U-M. That uses L, B, U, M. All new. And A in position 1.

- Position 2: BLAND (but D is new, but A in position 3? B-L-A-N-D -> A is in position 3, which we want to avoid). So not good.

  How about ""PAINT""? But T is not allowed.

  Or ""DAISY"": D-A-I-S-Y. A in position 2. And D, I, S, Y are new. And no forbidden letters? D, A, I, S, Y. Yes, no C, R, T, E.

- Position 4: We can try words like ""FINAL"" (F-I-N-A-L) -> A in position 4. But we have F, I, N, A, L. All new.

- Position 5: ""PIZZA"" (duplicate Z, and Z is rare), or ""JUMBA""? Not common. ""COMA"" is 4 letters. ""GUAVA"" has duplicate A and V, and G, U, V.

Considering the above, I think ""DAISY"" and ""FINAL"" are good candidates.

But we also want to cover more common letters. The most common letters left are S, O, L, N, D, I, etc.

""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> includes S and I, which are common. And Y is less common but acceptable.

""FINAL"": F, I, N, A, L -> includes I, N, L, which are common. F is less common.

Another option: ""BASIS""? But S is repeated and A is in position 2? B-A-S-I-S. A in position 2. But duplicate S. And B is new.

But we don't know if duplicate letters are in the word, so it might be okay, but we might get less information.

Alternatively, ""PLAIN"" is not good because A is in position 3.

I think ""DAISY"" is a good choice because:
- A is in position 2 (a new position)
- It uses D, I, S, Y (all new letters, and S and I are very common)
- It avoids C, R, T, E.

Another candidate: ""OASIS"" but O is new, but duplicate S and A in position 2? O-A-S-I-S. But we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. But duplicate S.

I think ""DAISY"" is better because it has all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""ALONG"" is also distinct: A, L, O, N, G. But A is in position 1, which is a new position. And it uses L, O, N, G.

But ""DAISY"" has S and Y, while ""ALONG"" has O and G. S is more common than G and O? Actually, S is the most common consonant.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""PAINS"" but P, A, I, N, S. A is in position 2? P-A-I-N-S. But we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. And distinct letters. But we don't have P in the feedback yet.

But note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are absent (C, R, T, E).

I think both ""DAISY"" and ""PAINS"" are good. But ""PAINS"" has A in position 2 and uses P, A, I, N, S.

But let me compare:

- ""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> tests D, I, S, Y and A in position 2.
- ""PAINS"": P, A, I, N, S -> tests P, A, I, N, S and A in position 2.

""PAINS"" uses more common letters: P, I, N, S are all in the top 20. D is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than D? According to letter frequency, S is very common, then N, I, P, then D.

But both are valid.

Another word: ""MAINS"" (like water mains) but M, A, I, N, S. A in position 2.

But I think ""PAINS"" is a word? Yes, as in ""he pains himself"".

But to have a more common word, how about ""PLANS""? But L is new, and A in position 3? P-L-A-N-S -> A in position 3, which we want to avoid.

So not good.

""SAUNA"": S-A-U-N-A. A in position 2 and 5, but duplicate A and U is less common.

I think ""PAINS"" is a good choice because it has common letters and distinct.

But let me check: we know A is in the word, so if we put A in position 2 and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's not in position 2. Also, we test P, I, N, S.

Similarly, ""DAISY"" tests D, I, S, Y.

But Y is less common, so ""PAINS"" might be better.

However, we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, T, E. Both words avoid them.

I'll go with ""PAINS"" because it has more common letters (P, I, N, S) and A in a new position (2).

But wait, in the first guess, A was in position 3. Now we are trying position 2. That's good.

Or ""ADMIN"" (A-D-M-I-N) -> A in 1, and D, M, I, N.

But I think ""PAINS"" is fine.

Another top candidate: ""SPAIN"" but S-P-A-I-N -> A in position 3? S(1)-P(2)-A(3)-I(4)-N(5). So A is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid.

Therefore, ""PAINS"" with A in position 2 is better.

But note: ""PAINS"" is a valid word? Yes, as a noun or verb.

So, I choose ""PAINS"".

But let me confirm: P-A-I-N-S. Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S.

We are testing A in position 2.

If we get a ✓ for A, then we know A is in position 2. If we get a '-', then A is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already know not in 3, so it must be in 1,4, or5). If we get an 'x' for A, that would be impossible because we know A is in the word. So we should get either ✓ or - for A.

Similarly, we get feedback on P, I, N, S.

This will give us good information.

So, second guess: PAINS.<thought>
We have feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"": 
- C(x), R(x), A(-), T(x), E(x)

This tells us:

But we don\'t know if there are two A\'s. Also, we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. But let\'s see: M, A, N, I, A. We can try.\n\nBut perhaps we can do better with a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried (like 1, 2, 4, or 5) and uses common letters.\n\nHow about ""SALAD""? S-A-L-A-D. A is in position 2 and 4. But we know at least one A is present, so if we get a \'-\' for both, we know there are two? But we are trying to get information. However, duplicate letters might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLAID"": P-L-A-I-D. A is in position 3 again? Same problem.\n\nWe need to avoid position 3 for A.\n\nLet me try to find words with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n- Position 1: ALONG, ALIGN, AISLE (but E is not allowed), ALBUM (B, U, M). ALBUM: A-L-B-U-M. That uses L, B, U, M. All new. And A in position 1.\n\n- Position 2: BLAND (but D is new, but A in position 3? B-L-A-N-D -> A is in position 3, which we want to avoid). So not good.\n\n  How about ""PAINT""? But T is not allowed.\n\n  Or ""DAISY"": D-A-I-S-Y. A in position 2. And D, I, S, Y are new. And no forbidden letters? D, A, I, S, Y. Yes, no C, R, T, E.\n\n- Position 4: We can try words like ""FINAL"" (F-I-N-A-L) -> A in position 4. But we have F, I, N, A, L. All new.\n\n- Position 5: ""PIZZA"" (duplicate Z, and Z is rare), or ""JUMBA""? Not common. ""COMA"" is 4 letters. ""GUAVA"" has duplicate A and V, and G, U, V.\n\nConsidering the above, I think ""DAISY"" and ""FINAL"" are good candidates.\n\nBut we also want to cover more common letters. The most common letters left are S, O, L, N, D, I, etc.\n\n""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> includes S and I, which are common. And Y is less common but acceptable.\n\n""FINAL"": F, I, N, A, L -> includes I, N, L, which are common. F is less common.\n\nAnother option: ""BASIS""? But S is repeated and A is in position 2? B-A-S-I-S. A in position 2. But duplicate S. And B is new.\n\nBut we don\'t know if duplicate letters are in the word, so it might be okay, but we might get less information.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLAIN"" is not good because A is in position 3.\n\nI think ""DAISY"" is a good choice because:\n- A is in position 2 (a new position)\n- It uses D, I, S, Y (all new letters, and S and I are very common)\n- It avoids C, R, T, E.\n\nAnother candidate: ""OASIS"" but O is new, but duplicate S and A in position 2? O-A-S-I-S. But we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. But duplicate S.\n\nI think ""DAISY"" is better because it has all distinct letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALONG"" is also distinct: A, L, O, N, G. But A is in position 1, which is a new position. And it uses L, O, N, G.\n\nBut ""DAISY"" has S and Y, while ""ALONG"" has O and G. S is more common than G and O? Actually, S is the most common consonant.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider ""PAINS"" but P, A, I, N, S. A is in position 2? P-A-I-N-S. But we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. And distinct letters. But we don\'t have P in the feedback yet.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are absent (C, R, T, E).\n\nI think both ""DAISY"" and ""PAINS"" are good. But ""PAINS"" has A in position 2 and uses P, A, I, N, S.\n\nBut let me compare:\n\n- ""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> tests D, I, S, Y and A in position 2.\n- ""PAINS"": P, A, I, N, S -> tests P, A, I, N, S and A in position 2.\n\n""PAINS"" uses more common letters: P, I, N, S are all in the top 20. D is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than D? According to letter frequency, S is very common, then N, I, P, then D.\n\nBut both are valid.\n\nAnother word: ""MAINS"" (like water mains) but M, A, I, N, S. A in position 2.\n\nBut I think ""PAINS"" is a word? Yes, as in ""he pains himself"".\n\nBut to have a more common word, how about ""PLANS""? But L is new, and A in position 3? P-L-A-N-S -> A in position 3, which we want to avoid.\n\nSo not good.\n\n""SAUNA"": S-A-U-N-A. A in position 2 and 5, but duplicate A and U is less common.\n\nI think ""PAINS"" is a good choice because it has common letters and distinct.\n\nBut let me check: we know A is in the word, so if we put A in position 2 and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it\'s not in position 2. Also, we test P, I, N, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""DAISY"" tests D, I, S, Y.\n\nBut Y is less common, so ""PAINS"" might be better.\n\nHowever, we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, T, E. Both words avoid them.\n\nI\'ll go with ""PAINS"" because it has more common letters (P, I, N, S) and A in a new position (2).\n\nBut wait, in the first guess, A was in position 3. Now we are trying position 2. That\'s good.\n\nAlternatively, we could try A in position 1: like ""ALIGN"" (A-L-I-G-N). But G is less common.\n\nOr ""ADMIN"" (A-D-M-I-N) -> A in 1, and D, M, I, N.\n\nBut I think ""PAINS"" is fine.\n\nAnother top candidate: ""SPAIN"" but S-P-A-I-N -> A in position 3? S(1)-P(2)-A(3)-I(4)-N(5). So A is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid.\n\nTherefore, ""PAINS"" with A in position 2 is better.\n\nBut note: ""PAINS"" is a valid word? Yes, as a noun or verb.\n\nSo, I choose ""PAINS"".\n\nBut let me confirm: P-A-I-N-S. Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S.\n\nWe are testing A in position 2.\n\nIf we get a ✓ for A, then we know A is in position 2. If we get a \'-\', then A is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already know not in 3, so it must be in 1,4, or5). If we get an \'x\' for A, that would be impossible because we know A is in the word. So we should get either ✓ or - for A.\n\nSimilarly, we get feedback on P, I, N, S.\n\nThis will give us good information.\n\nSo, second guess: PAINS.<thought>\nWe have feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"": \n- C(x), R(x), A(-), T(x), E(x)\n\nThis tells us:\n- The letter A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position (since it received a \'-\').\n- The letters C, R, T, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nFor the second guess, we need to:\n1. Include the letter A (since it\'s confirmed to be in the word) but avoid placing it in the 3rd position again.\n2. Avoid using C, R, T, or E (as they are absent).\n3. Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, I, N, P, L, O, D).\n4. Prefer a word with distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""PAINS"" is a valid 5-letter word that meets these criteria:\n  - It places A in position 2 (a new position to test).\n  - It uses new common letters: P, I, N, S (all untested and common in English).\n  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, T, E).\n  - All letters are distinct, increasing information potential.\n\nThis guess will help us:\n- Confirm if A is in position 2 (✓ or -).\n- Test the presence of P, I, N, S in the word.\n- Narrow down possible positions for A if it\'s not in position 2.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>PAINS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PAINS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) I(-) N(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRATE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- T: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: PAINS
- P: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) — but note: A was also in the wrong position in the first guess (position 3) and now in position 2, so A is in the word but not in position 2 or 3.
- I: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains A and I, but not in the positions we've tried (A not in 2 or 3, I not in 3).
- The absent letters are: C, R, T, E, P, N, S. (We can avoid these in future guesses.)
- The present letters (but position unknown) are: A and I.

We need to make a third guess that:
1. Includes A and I (since they are in the word) but not in positions 2 or 3 for A, and not in position 3 for I.
2. Avoids the absent letters: C, R, T, E, P, N, S.
3. Uses new letters to test for their presence.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the known absent ones. Absent: C, R, T, E, P, N, S. That's 7 letters. So 19 letters remain, but we must focus on common ones.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also know the word has 5 letters, and we have two confirmed letters: A and I.

Possible positions for A: Since it can't be in 2 or 3, it must be in 1, 4, or 5.
Similarly, I can't be in 3, so it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. But note: if I is in 1, then A cannot be in 1, so we have to consider combinations.

We need to form a valid English word that fits these constraints.

Let's think of words that have A and I, and avoid the forbidden letters.

Some ideas:
- We could try placing A in position 1 and I in position 4 or 5, for example.
- Or A in position 4 and I in position 1, etc.

Possible words:
- ""DAILY"": D-A-I-L-Y -> but A is in position 2 (which we know is wrong) and I in 3 (which we also know is wrong for I? Wait, I was in position 3 in PAINS and got a '-', meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put I in position 3 again. In DAILY, I is in position 3, so that's invalid for our guess because we know it's not there. Also, A is in position 2, which we know is wrong for A. So not good.

- ""MAILB"" is not a word.

- ""AVAIL"": A-V-A-I-L -> but has two A's? And A is in position 1 and 3. We know A is not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in 2 (from second guess). Position 1 is new. But also, I is in position 4. However, we have S? No, S is absent. But AVAIL has V and L. Also, we have to avoid S? Yes, S is absent. AVAIL doesn't have S, so it's okay. But let's check the letters: A (position 1), V, A (position 3? but we know A is not in position 3, so if we use AVAIL, the second A in position 3 would be incorrect, but we are only required to have A in the word, not necessarily both. However, the feedback might be messy because of duplicate A. We don't know if there are two A's. But we can try.

But note: in AVAIL, the first A is in position 1 (which is allowed) and the second A in position 3 (which we know is wrong). The I is in position 4. So we might get feedback that the first A is correct or not, and the second A might be marked as absent or wrong position? But since the word has at least one A, and if the secret word has only one A, then the second A would be marked as absent (x) because it's not in the word and in the wrong position? Actually, the rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's '-'. If the letter is not in the word at all, it's 'x'. But if the secret word has only one A, and we have two A's, then one might be correct or wrong position, and the other would be absent.

This could be confusing. To avoid complexity, let's try to use a word with distinct letters.

Better to avoid duplicates for now.

So, let's think of words with A and I, no duplicates, and avoid forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- ""ALIKE"": A-L-I-K-E -> but E is absent (from first guess), so we cannot use E.
- ""ALIBI"": A-L-I-B-I -> has two I's, duplicate.
- ""AVOID"": A-V-O-I-D -> A in 1, I in 4. Avoids forbidden letters? C,R,T,E,P,N,S are absent, so V,O,D are new. This seems good.
- ""DAISY"": but S is absent, so no.
- ""FAINT"": but T is absent and N is absent? T and N are both absent, so no.
- ""GUIDE"": has E and D? E is absent.

Another one: ""QUAIL"": Q-U-A-I-L -> but A is in position 3? Q(1)-U(2)-A(3)-I(4)-L(5). We know A cannot be in position 3, so this is invalid.

""OASIS"": has S and S, absent.

""JUMBO"": no A or I.

""BILLA"": not a word.

""LABIA"": L-A-B-I-A -> duplicates and A in position 2 (forbidden) and 5.

""MANIA"": M-A-N-I-A -> but N is absent and duplicate A.

""RADII"": R and D? R is absent.

So, ""AVOID"" seems a good candidate: A in position 1 (new position for A), I in position 4 (new position for I, since previously I was in 3). Letters: A, V, O, I, D. All distinct and not in the absent list.

Another option: ""VOILA"" -> V-O-I-L-A. But I is in position 3? V(1)-O(2)-I(3)-L(4)-A(5). We know I cannot be in position 3 (from PAINS feedback, I was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not that position). So we cannot put I in position 3 again. Also, A is in position 5, which is new.

But in VOILA, I is in position 3, which is forbidden for I. So we avoid.

""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D -> A in position 2? We know A is not in position 2, so invalid.

""AVIAN"": A-V-I-A-N -> duplicate A and N is absent.

So, ""AVOID"" seems a solid choice.

But let's confirm: A in 1, V in 2, O in 3, I in 4, D in 5.

We know A is not in 2 or 3, so position 1 is a good test.
I is not in 3, so position 4 is a good test.

We also test V, O, D.

So, we can use ""AVOID"".

Another word: ""ADMIN"" but N is absent.

""AXIOM"": A-X-I-O-M -> A in 1, X in 2, I in 3? I in position 3 is forbidden. So no.

""AZURE"": has E and no I? We need I.

""QUICK"": no A.

So, I think ""AVOID"" is a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: AVOID.

<thought>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRATE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, T, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (PAINS)**: A is in the word but not in position 2, I is in the word but not in position 3. P, N, S are absent.

Key insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A and I.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, T, E, P, N, S (must avoid these).
- **Position constraints**: 
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2).
  - I cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 2).
- **Possible positions for A**: 1, 4, or 5.
- **Possible positions for I**: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and I (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, T, E, P, N, S).
- Test new common letters to gather more information (e.g., D, L, O, V, Y).
- Prefer distinct letters to maximize coverage.

After evaluating options, ""AVOID"" is a strong choice because:
- It places A in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It places I in position 4 (a new position to test, avoiding position 3).
- It uses new letters: V, O, D (all untested and common).
- It avoids all absent letters and has no duplicates.
- It is a valid English word (verb meaning to keep away from).

This guess will help:
- Confirm if A is in position 1 (✓ or -).
- Confirm if I is in position 4 (✓ or -).
- Test the presence of V, O, D in the word.
- Narrow down positions for A and I further.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making our first guess. Since there's no prior feedback, we want to choose a word that maximizes information.
 The ideal starting words often have unique letters and include common letters to cover possibilities.

 Commonly used starting words include ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", or ""TRACE"". Let's choose one that has five distinct letters and covers common vowels and consonants.

 I choose ""SLATE"". It contains:
   S, L, A, T, E
 These are all common letters.

 So the first guess is ""SLATE"".<thought>
I am playing the Wordle game and need to make my first guess. There's no prior feedback, so I must choose a starting word strategically.
The best starting words typically:
- Use common English letters (like E, A, R, T, S) to maximize information gain
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities
- Are actual English words

I selected ""CRATE"" as my first guess because:
- It contains five distinct letters: C, R, A, T, E
- It uses very common letters (E and A are the two most common vowels; T and R are common consonants)
- ""CRATE"" is a valid English word (a noun/verb meaning a storage container)

This choice will help me get feedback on:
- Whether any of these letters are present in the secret word
- Possible positions for correct letters
</thought>

<guess>CRATE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRATE"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  T: x (not in the word)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letter A is in the secret word, but not in the 3rd position (since it was in the 3rd position in CRATE and got a '-' meaning wrong position).
- The letters C, R, T, E are not in the secret word at all.

Therefore, the secret word contains the letter A, but not in the 3rd position, and does not contain C, R, T, or E.

We need to make a second guess. We should choose a word that:
- Includes the letter A (since we know it's in the word) and places it in a different position (not 3rd).
- Avoids the letters C, R, T, E (since they are not in the word).
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible positions for A: since it can't be in position 3, it could be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

We also want to cover new common letters. Since we haven't tried many letters, we can try to include other vowels (like O, I, U) and common consonants (like S, N, L, D, etc.).

Let's think of words that have A in a position other than 3 and avoid C, R, T, E.

Some common letters we haven't tried: S, O, L, I, N, D, H, M, P, etc.

We can try to form a word that has A and some of these.

Example words:
- SALON: has A in position 2 (which is allowed) and uses S, L, O, N (all new letters). But note: we don't know if these are in the word, but we want to test.
- However, we must avoid C, R, T, E.

But wait: we know A is in the word, so we should definitely include it. Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another idea: since A is the only known letter, we can try to put it in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.

Let me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, T, E:

- Starting with A: ABLE, ABYSS (but ABYSS is 5 letters? ABYSS is 5: A-B-Y-S-S, but has duplicate S and Y is less common). Maybe not ideal.
- A in position 1: How about ""ALIEN""? But E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.

We must avoid E, so words with E are out.

So, let's think of words without C, R, T, E and with A in a position other than 3.

Possible words:
- A in position 1: ALOUD, ALOFT (but T is not allowed), ALONG (G is new), ALOHA (has H and O, but duplicate A? ALOHA: A-L-O-H-A, so two A's? But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we only know one A is present, so it might be safe to use, but we don't want to waste a guess on duplicate if not necessary). Alternatively, ""ANVIL"" (A in 1, but V is less common).

- A in position 2: SALAD (duplicate A and D, but D is new), but we can do better. How about ""PLAIN""? P, L, I, N are new. But we must avoid E? Yes, and PLAIN has no E, C, R, T? It has P, L, A, I, N. All new and allowed. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAIN: P-L-A-I-N -> A is in position 3? But we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not there? Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So in our new guess, we can put A in a different position to test. In PLAIN, A is in position 3, which is the same as before? We should avoid position 3 for A because we already know it's not there. So putting A in position 3 again would be a waste because we know it's not correct. We want to try A in a new position to get more information.

Therefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.

In PLAIN, A is in position 3, so that's not good.

What about ""BASIC""? But C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So we cannot use C.

Another word: ""MANIA""? M, A, N, I, A. But duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 5. But we don't know if there are two A's. Also, we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. But let's see: M, A, N, I, A. We can try.

But perhaps we can do better with a word that has A in a position we haven't tried (like 1, 2, 4, or 5) and uses common letters.

How about ""SALAD""? S-A-L-A-D. A is in position 2 and 4. But we know at least one A is present, so if we get a '-' for both, we know there are two? But we are trying to get information. However, duplicate letters might complicate.

Alternatively, ""PLAID"": P-L-A-I-D. A is in position 3 again? Same problem.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

Let me try to find words with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.

- Position 1: ALONG, ALIGN, AISLE (but E is not allowed), ALBUM (B, U, M). ALBUM: A-L-B-U-M. That uses L, B, U, M. All new. And A in position 1.

- Position 2: BLAND (but D is new, but A in position 3? B-L-A-N-D -> A is in position 3, which we want to avoid). So not good.

  How about ""PAINT""? But T is not allowed.

  Or ""DAISY"": D-A-I-S-Y. A in position 2. And D, I, S, Y are new. And no forbidden letters? D, A, I, S, Y. Yes, no C, R, T, E.

- Position 4: We can try words like ""FINAL"" (F-I-N-A-L) -> A in position 4. But we have F, I, N, A, L. All new.

- Position 5: ""PIZZA"" (duplicate Z, and Z is rare), or ""JUMBA""? Not common. ""COMA"" is 4 letters. ""GUAVA"" has duplicate A and V, and G, U, V.

Considering the above, I think ""DAISY"" and ""FINAL"" are good candidates.

But we also want to cover more common letters. The most common letters left are S, O, L, N, D, I, etc.

""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> includes S and I, which are common. And Y is less common but acceptable.

""FINAL"": F, I, N, A, L -> includes I, N, L, which are common. F is less common.

Another option: ""BASIS""? But S is repeated and A is in position 2? B-A-S-I-S. A in position 2. But duplicate S. And B is new.

But we don't know if duplicate letters are in the word, so it might be okay, but we might get less information.

Alternatively, ""PLAIN"" is not good because A is in position 3.

I think ""DAISY"" is a good choice because:
- A is in position 2 (a new position)
- It uses D, I, S, Y (all new letters, and S and I are very common)
- It avoids C, R, T, E.

Another candidate: ""OASIS"" but O is new, but duplicate S and A in position 2? O-A-S-I-S. But we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. But duplicate S.

I think ""DAISY"" is better because it has all distinct letters.

Similarly, ""ALONG"" is also distinct: A, L, O, N, G. But A is in position 1, which is a new position. And it uses L, O, N, G.

But ""DAISY"" has S and Y, while ""ALONG"" has O and G. S is more common than G and O? Actually, S is the most common consonant.

But we have to choose one.

We can also consider ""PAINS"" but P, A, I, N, S. A is in position 2? P-A-I-N-S. But we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. And distinct letters. But we don't have P in the feedback yet.

But note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are absent (C, R, T, E).

I think both ""DAISY"" and ""PAINS"" are good. But ""PAINS"" has A in position 2 and uses P, A, I, N, S.

But let me compare:

- ""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> tests D, I, S, Y and A in position 2.
- ""PAINS"": P, A, I, N, S -> tests P, A, I, N, S and A in position 2.

""PAINS"" uses more common letters: P, I, N, S are all in the top 20. D is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than D? According to letter frequency, S is very common, then N, I, P, then D.

But both are valid.

Another word: ""MAINS"" (like water mains) but M, A, I, N, S. A in position 2.

But I think ""PAINS"" is a word? Yes, as in ""he pains himself"".

But to have a more common word, how about ""PLANS""? But L is new, and A in position 3? P-L-A-N-S -> A in position 3, which we want to avoid.

So not good.

""SAUNA"": S-A-U-N-A. A in position 2 and 5, but duplicate A and U is less common.

I think ""PAINS"" is a good choice because it has common letters and distinct.

But let me check: we know A is in the word, so if we put A in position 2 and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it's not in position 2. Also, we test P, I, N, S.

Similarly, ""DAISY"" tests D, I, S, Y.

But Y is less common, so ""PAINS"" might be better.

However, we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, T, E. Both words avoid them.

I'll go with ""PAINS"" because it has more common letters (P, I, N, S) and A in a new position (2).

But wait, in the first guess, A was in position 3. Now we are trying position 2. That's good.

Alternatively, we could try A in position 1: like ""ALIGN"" (A-L-I-G-N). But G is less common.

Or ""ADMIN"" (A-D-M-I-N) -> A in 1, and D, M, I, N.

But I think ""PAINS"" is fine.

Another top candidate: ""SPAIN"" but S-P-A-I-N -> A in position 3? S(1)-P(2)-A(3)-I(4)-N(5). So A is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid.

Therefore, ""PAINS"" with A in position 2 is better.

But note: ""PAINS"" is a valid word? Yes, as a noun or verb.

So, I choose ""PAINS"".

But let me confirm: P-A-I-N-S. Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S.

We are testing A in position 2.

If we get a ✓ for A, then we know A is in position 2. If we get a '-', then A is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already know not in 3, so it must be in 1,4, or5). If we get an 'x' for A, that would be impossible because we know A is in the word. So we should get either ✓ or - for A.

Similarly, we get feedback on P, I, N, S.

This will give us good information.

So, second guess: PAINS.<thought>
We have feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"": 
- C(x), R(x), A(-), T(x), E(x)

This tells us:
- The letter A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position (since it received a '-').
- The letters C, R, T, and E are not in the secret word at all.

For the second guess, we need to:
1. Include the letter A (since it's confirmed to be in the word) but avoid placing it in the 3rd position again.
2. Avoid using C, R, T, or E (as they are absent).
3. Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, I, N, P, L, O, D).
4. Prefer a word with distinct letters to cover more possibilities.

After evaluating options:
- ""PAINS"" is a valid 5-letter word that meets these criteria:
  - It places A in position 2 (a new position to test).
  - It uses new common letters: P, I, N, S (all untested and common in English).
  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, T, E).
  - All letters are distinct, increasing information potential.

This guess will help us:
- Confirm if A is in position 2 (✓ or -).
- Test the presence of P, I, N, S in the word.
- Narrow down possible positions for A if it's not in position 2.
</thought>

<guess>PAINS</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PAINS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) I(-) N(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRATE
- C: x (not in word)
- R: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- T: x (not in word)
- E: x (not in word)

Guess 2: PAINS
- P: x (not in word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position) — but note: A was also in the wrong position in the first guess (position 3) and now in position 2, so A is in the word but not in position 2 or 3.
- I: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in word)
- S: x (not in word)

From this, we know:
- The secret word contains A and I, but not in the positions we've tried (A not in 2 or 3, I not in 3).
- The absent letters are: C, R, T, E, P, N, S. (We can avoid these in future guesses.)
- The present letters (but position unknown) are: A and I.

We need to make a third guess that:
1. Includes A and I (since they are in the word) but not in positions 2 or 3 for A, and not in position 3 for I.
2. Avoids the absent letters: C, R, T, E, P, N, S.
3. Uses new letters to test for their presence.

Available letters: We have 26 letters minus the known absent ones. Absent: C, R, T, E, P, N, S. That's 7 letters. So 19 letters remain, but we must focus on common ones.

Common letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also know the word has 5 letters, and we have two confirmed letters: A and I.

Possible positions for A: Since it can't be in 2 or 3, it must be in 1, 4, or 5.
Similarly, I can't be in 3, so it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. But note: if I is in 1, then A cannot be in 1, so we have to consider combinations.

We need to form a valid English word that fits these constraints.

Let's think of words that have A and I, and avoid the forbidden letters.

Some ideas:
- We could try placing A in position 1 and I in position 4 or 5, for example.
- Or A in position 4 and I in position 1, etc.

Possible words:
- ""DAILY"": D-A-I-L-Y -> but A is in position 2 (which we know is wrong) and I in 3 (which we also know is wrong for I? Wait, I was in position 3 in PAINS and got a '-', meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put I in position 3 again. In DAILY, I is in position 3, so that's invalid for our guess because we know it's not there. Also, A is in position 2, which we know is wrong for A. So not good.

- ""MAILB"" is not a word.

- ""AVAIL"": A-V-A-I-L -> but has two A's? And A is in position 1 and 3. We know A is not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in 2 (from second guess). Position 1 is new. But also, I is in position 4. However, we have S? No, S is absent. But AVAIL has V and L. Also, we have to avoid S? Yes, S is absent. AVAIL doesn't have S, so it's okay. But let's check the letters: A (position 1), V, A (position 3? but we know A is not in position 3, so if we use AVAIL, the second A in position 3 would be incorrect, but we are only required to have A in the word, not necessarily both. However, the feedback might be messy because of duplicate A. We don't know if there are two A's. But we can try.

But note: in AVAIL, the first A is in position 1 (which is allowed) and the second A in position 3 (which we know is wrong). The I is in position 4. So we might get feedback that the first A is correct or not, and the second A might be marked as absent or wrong position? But since the word has at least one A, and if the secret word has only one A, then the second A would be marked as absent (x) because it's not in the word and in the wrong position? Actually, the rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it's '-'. If the letter is not in the word at all, it's 'x'. But if the secret word has only one A, and we have two A's, then one might be correct or wrong position, and the other would be absent.

This could be confusing. To avoid complexity, let's try to use a word with distinct letters.

Better to avoid duplicates for now.

So, let's think of words with A and I, no duplicates, and avoid forbidden letters.

Possible words:
- ""ALIKE"": A-L-I-K-E -> but E is absent (from first guess), so we cannot use E.
- ""ALIBI"": A-L-I-B-I -> has two I's, duplicate.
- ""AVOID"": A-V-O-I-D -> A in 1, I in 4. Avoids forbidden letters? C,R,T,E,P,N,S are absent, so V,O,D are new. This seems good.
- ""DAISY"": but S is absent, so no.
- ""FAINT"": but T is absent and N is absent? T and N are both absent, so no.
- ""GUIDE"": has E and D? E is absent.

Another one: ""QUAIL"": Q-U-A-I-L -> but A is in position 3? Q(1)-U(2)-A(3)-I(4)-L(5). We know A cannot be in position 3, so this is invalid.

""OASIS"": has S and S, absent.

""JUMBO"": no A or I.

""BILLA"": not a word.

""LABIA"": L-A-B-I-A -> duplicates and A in position 2 (forbidden) and 5.

""MANIA"": M-A-N-I-A -> but N is absent and duplicate A.

""RADII"": R and D? R is absent.

So, ""AVOID"" seems a good candidate: A in position 1 (new position for A), I in position 4 (new position for I, since previously I was in 3). Letters: A, V, O, I, D. All distinct and not in the absent list.

Another option: ""VOILA"" -> V-O-I-L-A. But I is in position 3? V(1)-O(2)-I(3)-L(4)-A(5). We know I cannot be in position 3 (from PAINS feedback, I was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not that position). So we cannot put I in position 3 again. Also, A is in position 5, which is new.

But in VOILA, I is in position 3, which is forbidden for I. So we avoid.

""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D -> A in position 2? We know A is not in position 2, so invalid.

""AVIAN"": A-V-I-A-N -> duplicate A and N is absent.

So, ""AVOID"" seems a solid choice.

But let's confirm: A in 1, V in 2, O in 3, I in 4, D in 5.

We know A is not in 2 or 3, so position 1 is a good test.
I is not in 3, so position 4 is a good test.

We also test V, O, D.

So, we can use ""AVOID"".

Another word: ""ADMIN"" but N is absent.

""AXIOM"": A-X-I-O-M -> A in 1, X in 2, I in 3? I in position 3 is forbidden. So no.

""AZURE"": has E and no I? We need I.

""QUICK"": no A.

So, I think ""AVOID"" is a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: AVOID.<thought>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRATE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, T, E are absent.
- **Guess 2 (PAINS)**: A is in the word but not in position 2, I is in the word but not in position 3. P, N, S are absent.

Key insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A and I.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, T, E, P, N, S (must avoid these).
- **Position constraints**: 
  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2).
  - I cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 2).
- **Possible positions for A**: 1, 4, or 5.
- **Possible positions for I**: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and I (since they are confirmed present).
- Avoid absent letters (C, R, T, E, P, N, S).
- Test new common letters to gather more information (e.g., D, L, O, V, Y).
- Prefer distinct letters to maximize coverage.

After evaluating options, ""AVOID"" is a strong choice because:
- It places A in position 1 (a new position to test).
- It places I in position 4 (a new position to test, avoiding position 3).
- It uses new letters: V, O, D (all untested and common).
- It avoids all absent letters and has no duplicates.
- It is a valid English word (verb meaning to keep away from).

This guess will help:
- Confirm if A is in position 1 (✓ or -).
- Confirm if I is in position 4 (✓ or -).
- Test the presence of V, O, D in the word.
- Narrow down positions for A and I further.

Also, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother idea: since A is the only known letter, we can try to put it in position 1 or 2 or 4 or 5.\n\nLet me list some words that have A and avoid C, R, T, E:\n\n- Starting with A: ABLE, ABYSS (but ABYSS is 5 letters? ABYSS is 5: A-B-Y-S-S, but has duplicate S and Y is less common). Maybe not ideal.\n- A in position 1: How about ""ALIEN""? But E is not allowed (we know E is not in the word). So we cannot use E.\n\nWe must avoid E, so words with E are out.\n\nSo, let\'s think of words without C, R, T, E and with A in a position other than 3.\n\nPossible words:\n- A in position 1: ALOUD, ALOFT (but T is not allowed), ALONG (G is new), ALOHA (has H and O, but duplicate A? ALOHA: A-L-O-H-A, so two A\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, we only know one A is present, so it might be safe to use, but we don\'t want to waste a guess on duplicate if not necessary). Alternatively, ""ANVIL"" (A in 1, but V is less common).\n\n- A in position 2: SALAD (duplicate A and D, but D is new), but we can do better. How about ""PLAIN""? P, L, I, N are new. But we must avoid E? Yes, and PLAIN has no E, C, R, T? It has P, L, A, I, N. All new and allowed. And A is in position 3? Wait, PLAIN: P-L-A-I-N -> A is in position 3? But we cannot put A in position 3 because we know it\'s not there? Wait, no: the feedback said A is in the word but not in position 3. So in our new guess, we can put A in a different position to test. In PLAIN, A is in position 3, which is the same as before? We should avoid position 3 for A because we already know it\'s not there. So putting A in position 3 again would be a waste because we know it\'s not correct. We want to try A in a new position to get more information.\n\nTherefore, we should avoid position 3 for A.\n\nIn PLAIN, A is in position 3, so that\'s not good.\n\nWhat about ""BASIC""? But C is not allowed (we know C is not in the word). So we cannot use C.\n\nAnother word: ""MANIA""? M, A, N, I, A. But duplicate A? And A is in position 2 and 5. But we don\'t know if there are two A\'s. Also, we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. But let\'s see: M, A, N, I, A. We can try.\n\nBut perhaps we can do better with a word that has A in a position we haven\'t tried (like 1, 2, 4, or 5) and uses common letters.\n\nHow about ""SALAD""? S-A-L-A-D. A is in position 2 and 4. But we know at least one A is present, so if we get a \'-\' for both, we know there are two? But we are trying to get information. However, duplicate letters might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLAID"": P-L-A-I-D. A is in position 3 again? Same problem.\n\nWe need to avoid position 3 for A.\n\nLet me try to find words with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.\n\n- Position 1: ALONG, ALIGN, AISLE (but E is not allowed), ALBUM (B, U, M). ALBUM: A-L-B-U-M. That uses L, B, U, M. All new. And A in position 1.\n\n- Position 2: BLAND (but D is new, but A in position 3? B-L-A-N-D -> A is in position 3, which we want to avoid). So not good.\n\n  How about ""PAINT""? But T is not allowed.\n\n  Or ""DAISY"": D-A-I-S-Y. A in position 2. And D, I, S, Y are new. And no forbidden letters? D, A, I, S, Y. Yes, no C, R, T, E.\n\n- Position 4: We can try words like ""FINAL"" (F-I-N-A-L) -> A in position 4. But we have F, I, N, A, L. All new.\n\n- Position 5: ""PIZZA"" (duplicate Z, and Z is rare), or ""JUMBA""? Not common. ""COMA"" is 4 letters. ""GUAVA"" has duplicate A and V, and G, U, V.\n\nConsidering the above, I think ""DAISY"" and ""FINAL"" are good candidates.\n\nBut we also want to cover more common letters. The most common letters left are S, O, L, N, D, I, etc.\n\n""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> includes S and I, which are common. And Y is less common but acceptable.\n\n""FINAL"": F, I, N, A, L -> includes I, N, L, which are common. F is less common.\n\nAnother option: ""BASIS""? But S is repeated and A is in position 2? B-A-S-I-S. A in position 2. But duplicate S. And B is new.\n\nBut we don\'t know if duplicate letters are in the word, so it might be okay, but we might get less information.\n\nAlternatively, ""PLAIN"" is not good because A is in position 3.\n\nI think ""DAISY"" is a good choice because:\n- A is in position 2 (a new position)\n- It uses D, I, S, Y (all new letters, and S and I are very common)\n- It avoids C, R, T, E.\n\nAnother candidate: ""OASIS"" but O is new, but duplicate S and A in position 2? O-A-S-I-S. But we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. But duplicate S.\n\nI think ""DAISY"" is better because it has all distinct letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""ALONG"" is also distinct: A, L, O, N, G. But A is in position 1, which is a new position. And it uses L, O, N, G.\n\nBut ""DAISY"" has S and Y, while ""ALONG"" has O and G. S is more common than G and O? Actually, S is the most common consonant.\n\nBut we have to choose one.\n\nWe can also consider ""PAINS"" but P, A, I, N, S. A is in position 2? P-A-I-N-S. But we avoid C, R, T, E? Yes. And distinct letters. But we don\'t have P in the feedback yet.\n\nBut note: we are allowed to use any letters except the ones we know are absent (C, R, T, E).\n\nI think both ""DAISY"" and ""PAINS"" are good. But ""PAINS"" has A in position 2 and uses P, A, I, N, S.\n\nBut let me compare:\n\n- ""DAISY"": D, A, I, S, Y -> tests D, I, S, Y and A in position 2.\n- ""PAINS"": P, A, I, N, S -> tests P, A, I, N, S and A in position 2.\n\n""PAINS"" uses more common letters: P, I, N, S are all in the top 20. D is less common than P? Actually, P is more common than D? According to letter frequency, S is very common, then N, I, P, then D.\n\nBut both are valid.\n\nAnother word: ""MAINS"" (like water mains) but M, A, I, N, S. A in position 2.\n\nBut I think ""PAINS"" is a word? Yes, as in ""he pains himself"".\n\nBut to have a more common word, how about ""PLANS""? But L is new, and A in position 3? P-L-A-N-S -> A in position 3, which we want to avoid.\n\nSo not good.\n\n""SAUNA"": S-A-U-N-A. A in position 2 and 5, but duplicate A and U is less common.\n\nI think ""PAINS"" is a good choice because it has common letters and distinct.\n\nBut let me check: we know A is in the word, so if we put A in position 2 and it is correct, we get a check. If not, we get a minus and know it\'s not in position 2. Also, we test P, I, N, S.\n\nSimilarly, ""DAISY"" tests D, I, S, Y.\n\nBut Y is less common, so ""PAINS"" might be better.\n\nHowever, we must avoid the forbidden letters: C, R, T, E. Both words avoid them.\n\nI\'ll go with ""PAINS"" because it has more common letters (P, I, N, S) and A in a new position (2).\n\nBut wait, in the first guess, A was in position 3. Now we are trying position 2. That\'s good.\n\nAlternatively, we could try A in position 1: like ""ALIGN"" (A-L-I-G-N). But G is less common.\n\nOr ""ADMIN"" (A-D-M-I-N) -> A in 1, and D, M, I, N.\n\nBut I think ""PAINS"" is fine.\n\nAnother top candidate: ""SPAIN"" but S-P-A-I-N -> A in position 3? S(1)-P(2)-A(3)-I(4)-N(5). So A is in position 3 again, which we know is wrong. So we should avoid.\n\nTherefore, ""PAINS"" with A in position 2 is better.\n\nBut note: ""PAINS"" is a valid word? Yes, as a noun or verb.\n\nSo, I choose ""PAINS"".\n\nBut let me confirm: P-A-I-N-S. Positions: 1:P, 2:A, 3:I, 4:N, 5:S.\n\nWe are testing A in position 2.\n\nIf we get a ✓ for A, then we know A is in position 2. If we get a \'-\', then A is in the word but not in position 2 (and we already know not in 3, so it must be in 1,4, or5). If we get an \'x\' for A, that would be impossible because we know A is in the word. So we should get either ✓ or - for A.\n\nSimilarly, we get feedback on P, I, N, S.\n\nThis will give us good information.\n\nSo, second guess: PAINS.<thought>\nWe have feedback from the first guess ""CRATE"": \n- C(x), R(x), A(-), T(x), E(x)\n\nThis tells us:\n- The letter A is in the secret word but not in the 3rd position (since it received a \'-\').\n- The letters C, R, T, and E are not in the secret word at all.\n\nFor the second guess, we need to:\n1. Include the letter A (since it\'s confirmed to be in the word) but avoid placing it in the 3rd position again.\n2. Avoid using C, R, T, or E (as they are absent).\n3. Use new common letters to maximize information gain (e.g., S, I, N, P, L, O, D).\n4. Prefer a word with distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""PAINS"" is a valid 5-letter word that meets these criteria:\n  - It places A in position 2 (a new position to test).\n  - It uses new common letters: P, I, N, S (all untested and common in English).\n  - It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, T, E).\n  - All letters are distinct, increasing information potential.\n\nThis guess will help us:\n- Confirm if A is in position 2 (✓ or -).\n- Test the presence of P, I, N, S in the word.\n- Narrow down possible positions for A if it\'s not in position 2.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>PAINS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PAINS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) I(-) N(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\nGuess 1: CRATE\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: x (not in word)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position)\n- T: x (not in word)\n- E: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 2: PAINS\n- P: x (not in word)\n- A: - (in word, wrong position) — but note: A was also in the wrong position in the first guess (position 3) and now in position 2, so A is in the word but not in position 2 or 3.\n- I: - (in word, wrong position)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- S: x (not in word)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The secret word contains A and I, but not in the positions we\'ve tried (A not in 2 or 3, I not in 3).\n- The absent letters are: C, R, T, E, P, N, S. (We can avoid these in future guesses.)\n- The present letters (but position unknown) are: A and I.\n\nWe need to make a third guess that:\n1. Includes A and I (since they are in the word) but not in positions 2 or 3 for A, and not in position 3 for I.\n2. Avoids the absent letters: C, R, T, E, P, N, S.\n3. Uses new letters to test for their presence.\n\nAvailable letters: We have 26 letters minus the known absent ones. Absent: C, R, T, E, P, N, S. That\'s 7 letters. So 19 letters remain, but we must focus on common ones.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe also know the word has 5 letters, and we have two confirmed letters: A and I.\n\nPossible positions for A: Since it can\'t be in 2 or 3, it must be in 1, 4, or 5.\nSimilarly, I can\'t be in 3, so it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5. But note: if I is in 1, then A cannot be in 1, so we have to consider combinations.\n\nWe need to form a valid English word that fits these constraints.\n\nLet\'s think of words that have A and I, and avoid the forbidden letters.\n\nSome ideas:\n- We could try placing A in position 1 and I in position 4 or 5, for example.\n- Or A in position 4 and I in position 1, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""DAILY"": D-A-I-L-Y -> but A is in position 2 (which we know is wrong) and I in 3 (which we also know is wrong for I? Wait, I was in position 3 in PAINS and got a \'-\', meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So we cannot put I in position 3 again. In DAILY, I is in position 3, so that\'s invalid for our guess because we know it\'s not there. Also, A is in position 2, which we know is wrong for A. So not good.\n\n- ""MAILB"" is not a word.\n\n- ""AVAIL"": A-V-A-I-L -> but has two A\'s? And A is in position 1 and 3. We know A is not in position 3 (from first guess) and not in 2 (from second guess). Position 1 is new. But also, I is in position 4. However, we have S? No, S is absent. But AVAIL has V and L. Also, we have to avoid S? Yes, S is absent. AVAIL doesn\'t have S, so it\'s okay. But let\'s check the letters: A (position 1), V, A (position 3? but we know A is not in position 3, so if we use AVAIL, the second A in position 3 would be incorrect, but we are only required to have A in the word, not necessarily both. However, the feedback might be messy because of duplicate A. We don\'t know if there are two A\'s. But we can try.\n\nBut note: in AVAIL, the first A is in position 1 (which is allowed) and the second A in position 3 (which we know is wrong). The I is in position 4. So we might get feedback that the first A is correct or not, and the second A might be marked as absent or wrong position? But since the word has at least one A, and if the secret word has only one A, then the second A would be marked as absent (x) because it\'s not in the word and in the wrong position? Actually, the rules: if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, it\'s \'-\'. If the letter is not in the word at all, it\'s \'x\'. But if the secret word has only one A, and we have two A\'s, then one might be correct or wrong position, and the other would be absent.\n\nThis could be confusing. To avoid complexity, let\'s try to use a word with distinct letters.\n\nBetter to avoid duplicates for now.\n\nSo, let\'s think of words with A and I, no duplicates, and avoid forbidden letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""ALIKE"": A-L-I-K-E -> but E is absent (from first guess), so we cannot use E.\n- ""ALIBI"": A-L-I-B-I -> has two I\'s, duplicate.\n- ""AVOID"": A-V-O-I-D -> A in 1, I in 4. Avoids forbidden letters? C,R,T,E,P,N,S are absent, so V,O,D are new. This seems good.\n- ""DAISY"": but S is absent, so no.\n- ""FAINT"": but T is absent and N is absent? T and N are both absent, so no.\n- ""GUIDE"": has E and D? E is absent.\n\nAnother one: ""QUAIL"": Q-U-A-I-L -> but A is in position 3? Q(1)-U(2)-A(3)-I(4)-L(5). We know A cannot be in position 3, so this is invalid.\n\n""OASIS"": has S and S, absent.\n\n""JUMBO"": no A or I.\n\n""BILLA"": not a word.\n\n""LABIA"": L-A-B-I-A -> duplicates and A in position 2 (forbidden) and 5.\n\n""MANIA"": M-A-N-I-A -> but N is absent and duplicate A.\n\n""RADII"": R and D? R is absent.\n\nSo, ""AVOID"" seems a good candidate: A in position 1 (new position for A), I in position 4 (new position for I, since previously I was in 3). Letters: A, V, O, I, D. All distinct and not in the absent list.\n\nAnother option: ""VOILA"" -> V-O-I-L-A. But I is in position 3? V(1)-O(2)-I(3)-L(4)-A(5). We know I cannot be in position 3 (from PAINS feedback, I was in position 3 and got \'-\', meaning it\'s in the word but not that position). So we cannot put I in position 3 again. Also, A is in position 5, which is new.\n\nBut in VOILA, I is in position 3, which is forbidden for I. So we avoid.\n\n""VALID"": V-A-L-I-D -> A in position 2? We know A is not in position 2, so invalid.\n\n""AVIAN"": A-V-I-A-N -> duplicate A and N is absent.\n\nSo, ""AVOID"" seems a solid choice.\n\nBut let\'s confirm: A in 1, V in 2, O in 3, I in 4, D in 5.\n\nWe know A is not in 2 or 3, so position 1 is a good test.\nI is not in 3, so position 4 is a good test.\n\nWe also test V, O, D.\n\nSo, we can use ""AVOID"".\n\nAnother word: ""ADMIN"" but N is absent.\n\n""AXIOM"": A-X-I-O-M -> A in 1, X in 2, I in 3? I in position 3 is forbidden. So no.\n\n""AZURE"": has E and no I? We need I.\n\n""QUICK"": no A.\n\nSo, I think ""AVOID"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, third guess: AVOID.<thought>\nBased on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (CRATE)**: A is in the word but not in position 3. C, R, T, E are absent.\n- **Guess 2 (PAINS)**: A is in the word but not in position 2, I is in the word but not in position 3. P, N, S are absent.\n\nKey insights:\n- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A and I.\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, T, E, P, N, S (must avoid these).\n- **Position constraints**: \n  - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from Guess 1 and 2).\n  - I cannot be in position 3 (from Guess 2).\n- **Possible positions for A**: 1, 4, or 5.\n- **Possible positions for I**: 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but not 3).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A and I (since they are confirmed present).\n- Avoid absent letters (C, R, T, E, P, N, S).\n- Test new common letters to gather more information (e.g., D, L, O, V, Y).\n- Prefer distinct letters to maximize coverage.\n\nAfter evaluating options, ""AVOID"" is a strong choice because:\n- It places A in position 1 (a new position to test).\n- It places I in position 4 (a new position to test, avoiding position 3).\n- It uses new letters: V, O, D (all untested and common).\n- It avoids all absent letters and has no duplicates.\n- It is a valid English word (verb meaning to keep away from).\n\nThis guess will help:\n- Confirm if A is in position 1 (✓ or -).\n- Confirm if I is in position 4 (✓ or -).\n- Test the presence of V, O, D in the word.\n- Narrow down positions for A and I further.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>AVOID</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRATE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: PAINS -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) I(-) N(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: AVOID -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) V(x) O(-) I(✓) D(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRATE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, R, T, E are absent.

Guess 2: PAINS -> P(x) A(-) I(-) N(x) S(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 2.
  - I is in the word but not in position 3.
  - P, N, S are absent.

Guess 3: AVOID -> A(✓) V(x) O(-) I(✓) D(-)
  - A is correct and in position 1 (since it got a ✓).
  - I is correct and in position 4 (since it got a ✓).
  - O is in the word but not in position 3 (since it got a -).
  - D is in the word but not in position 5 (since it got a -).
  - V is absent.

So, we now know:
- The word has A in position 1 and I in position 4.
- O and D are in the word, but O is not in position 3 and D is not in position 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, T, E, P, N, S, V.

The secret word pattern so far: A _ _ I _

We also know that O and D are present, but not in the positions we've seen.

Possible positions for O: It cannot be in position 3 (from AVOID feedback). Since position 1 is taken by A, and position 4 is taken by I, O can be in position 2 or 5.

Similarly, D cannot be in position 5 (from AVOID feedback). Since position 1 and 4 are taken, D can be in position 2 or 3.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we have A, I, O, D as confirmed letters. That's 4 letters, so the word must be composed of these 4 and one more letter? Or could there be duplicates? We don't know, but so far we have 4 distinct letters: A, I, O, D.

The secret word: A _ _ I _

We need to fill the second, third, and fifth positions.

But we know O and D are in the word, so they must occupy two of the three blank positions: 2, 3, 5.

Constraints:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AVOID, it was in position 3 and got '-', so wrong position).
- D cannot be in position 5 (from AVOID, it was in position 5 and got '-', so wrong position).

Therefore, for O: possible positions are 2 or 5.
For D: possible positions are 2 or 3.

But position 2 can only hold one letter. So we have two cases:

Case 1: O in position 2, then D must be in position 3 (since it can't be in 5, and 2 is taken by O, 1 and 4 taken, so only 3 or 5, but 5 is still available but D cannot be in 5, so D must be in 3). Then position 5 must be the fifth letter, which we don't know yet? But we have only 4 letters so far? Wait, we have A, I, O, D — that's four, and the word has five letters, so there must be one more letter.

Case 2: O in position 5, then D can be in position 2 or 3, and the remaining position (if D in 2, then position 3 is open; if D in 3, then position 2 is open) must be filled by a new letter.

But we also know that O and D are the only other confirmed letters, but there might be a fifth letter that we haven't guessed yet.

In guess 3, we have A, V, O, I, D. We know V is absent, so the secret word has A, I, O, D, and one more letter (since 5 letters total).

So, the secret word has exactly 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have evidence of duplicates.

We'll assume no duplicates for now, but be cautious.

So, the word is: A _ _ I _

We need to assign:
- O to position 2 or 5.
- D to position 2 or 3 (but not 5).
- And there is one more letter, say X, which must be in the remaining position.

Also, the absent letters are: C, R, T, E, P, N, S, V. So we must avoid these.

Now, let's consider the cases:

Case 1: O in position 2.
Then, since O is in 2, and D cannot be in 5, and positions available: 3 and 5. But D cannot be in 5, so D must be in 3. Then position 5 must be the new letter X.
So the word is: A O D I X

Case 2: O in position 5.
Then, D can be in 2 or 3.
  - Subcase 2a: D in position 2. Then position 3 is X. Word: A D X I O
  - Subcase 2b: D in position 3. Then position 2 is X. Word: A X D I O

We also know that O is in the word and not in position 3 (which we already accounted for) and D is not in position 5 (also accounted for).

Now, we need to find valid English words that fit these patterns and use only the available letters (avoiding absent ones).

First, Case 1: A O D I X
What words are there? AODIX? Not a word. We need a word starting with ""AODI"" and then a letter. But ""AODI"" is not a common root. Possible? I can't think of any. Let's list possible X.

The word must be A O D I and then a fifth letter. But the fifth letter must be a consonant or vowel? And form a word.

Possible words: I don't know any 5-letter word starting with ""AODI"". For example, ""AODIA"" or something? Not a word. So this case might be invalid.

Therefore, Case 1 (O in 2 and D in 3) is unlikely.

Now, Case 2: O in position 5. So the word ends with I O? Actually, position 4 is I, position 5 is O, so the word ends with ""IO""? But that's unusual for English words. More common is ending with ""IO"" like in audio, but audio is 5 letters: A-U-D-I-O.

Audio! That's a word.

In ""AUDIO"": A-U-D-I-O.
- Position 1: A (correct, we know)
- Position 2: U (new letter)
- Position 3: D (D is in position 3? But we have D in position 3, and in AVOID, D was in position 5 and got '-', meaning D is not in position 5, but it could be in position 3. Also, in AUDIO, D is in position 3, which is allowed because we haven't tested D in position 3 before? We only know D is not in position 5, but it could be in 3.
- Position 4: I (correct)
- Position 5: O (O is in position 5, and we know O is not in position 3, but position 5 is new, so it could be)

Also, check the absent letters: U is not in the absent list (C,R,T,E,P,N,S,V are absent, U is new and allowed).

So ""AUDIO"" is a candidate.

Now, in this case, we have subcase 2b: D in position 3, and position 2 is U.

But we also have subcase 2a: D in position 2. What word would that be? A D ? I O. For example, ""ADRIO"" but R is absent. ""ADMIO"" not a word. ""ADLIB"" but L is allowed, but ""ADLIB"" is 5 letters? A-D-L-I-B, but that ends with B, not O. We need to end with I O? Position 4 is I, position 5 is O, so the last two letters must be I and O in that order.

So words ending with ""IO"" are rare. ""AUDIO"" is one. ""RADIO"" but R is absent. ""AUDIO"" is the most common.

Another one: ""CAMEO"" but C is absent and M? But C is absent. ""VIDEO"" but V is absent. So ""AUDIO"" seems the only common word.

But let's confirm the pattern: A _ _ I O, with the third letter being D? In AUDIO, it's A-U-D-I-O, so second letter U, third D.

We also have the possibility of O in position 5 and D in position 2: A D ? I O. What words? ""ADIOS"" but S is absent. ""ADIEU"" but E is absent and U is used, but E is not allowed. ""ADIEU"" has E. ""ADZIO"" not a word. So no common words with A D ? I O.

Therefore, the only common word that fits is ""AUDIO"".

But we must check if it satisfies all feedback.

Check against feedback:

- A is in position 1: correct, as per AVOID feedback (A✓).
- I is in position 4: correct, as per AVOID (I✓).
- O is in position 5: in AVOID, O was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not position 3. In AUDIO, O is in position 5, which is fine.
- D is in position 3: in AVOID, D was in position 5 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not position 5. In AUDIO, D is in position 3, which is a different position, so it should be okay.

Also, the letter U is new and not in the absent list.

Absent letters: we have C,R,T,E,P,N,S,V absent. U is not in that list, so it's allowed.

Therefore, ""AUDIO"" is a valid candidate and likely the secret word.

But we need to make a guess. Since it fits perfectly, we can guess ""AUDIO"".

But note: in the feedback for AVOID, we have D(-) meaning D is in the word but not in position 5. In AUDIO, D is in position 3, which is consistent.

Similarly, O(-) in AVOID (position 3) and in AUDIO it's in 5, so also consistent.

And we have no other constraints.

So, we should guess ""AUDIO"".

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What if the word has a duplicate? For example, could there be two O's? But we don't have evidence. In AUDIO, all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""AULOI"" — not a common word. ""AULOI"" is plural of aulos, but rare. And it has O in position 5 and I in 4, but A U L O I: L is new, but we can check. But ""AULOI"" is not common.

""JUDIO"" — J is new, but J-U-D-I-O, and U and D, but J not absent? But we don't know J, but it's less common. And ""JUDIO"" is not a standard word.

So, ""AUDIO"" is the best guess.

Therefore, we guess ""AUDIO"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **A** is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 1 (from Guess 3: A(✓)).
- **I** is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4 (from Guess 3: I(✓)).
- **O** is in the secret word but not in position 3 (from Guess 3: O(-)).
- **D** is in the secret word but not in position 5 (from Guess 3: D(-)).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, T, E, P, N, S, V (from all feedback, marked as ""x"").
- The secret word pattern is: `A _ _ I _`.

Given the constraints:
- **O** must be in position 2 or 5 (since position 1 is taken by A, position 4 is taken by I, and it cannot be in position 3).
- **D** must be in position 2 or 3 (since position 1 and 4 are taken, and it cannot be in position 5).
- The word must include one additional letter (since A, I, O, and D account for 4 letters, but the word has 5 positions).
- All letters must avoid the absent list (C, R, T, E, P, N, S, V).

After evaluating possible words that fit the pattern `A _ _ I _` and satisfy the constraints, the word **""AUDIO""** emerges as the strongest candidate:
- It matches the pattern: `A U D I O`.
- **A** is in position 1 (correct, as known).
- **I** is in position 4 (correct, as known).
- **O** is in position 5 (valid, since it cannot be in position 3, and position 5 is untested).
- **D** is in position 3 (valid, since it cannot be in position 5, and position 3 is untested).
- **U** is a new, untested letter (not in the absent list).
- ""AUDIO"" is a common English word, avoiding all absent letters.

This guess will confirm the positions of O and D while testing the new letter U. If correct, it solves the puzzle.

<guess>AUDIO</guess>",AUDIO,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: CRATE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) T(x) E(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 3.
  - C, R, T, E are absent.

Guess 2: PAINS -> P(x) A(-) I(-) N(x) S(x)
  - A is in the word but not in position 2.
  - I is in the word but not in position 3.
  - P, N, S are absent.

Guess 3: AVOID -> A(✓) V(x) O(-) I(✓) D(-)
  - A is correct and in position 1 (since it got a ✓).
  - I is correct and in position 4 (since it got a ✓).
  - O is in the word but not in position 3 (since it got a -).
  - D is in the word but not in position 5 (since it got a -).
  - V is absent.

So, we now know:
- The word has A in position 1 and I in position 4.
- O and D are in the word, but O is not in position 3 and D is not in position 5.
- Absent letters: C, R, T, E, P, N, S, V.

The secret word pattern so far: A _ _ I _

We also know that O and D are present, but not in the positions we've seen.

Possible positions for O: It cannot be in position 3 (from AVOID feedback). Since position 1 is taken by A, and position 4 is taken by I, O can be in position 2 or 5.

Similarly, D cannot be in position 5 (from AVOID feedback). Since position 1 and 4 are taken, D can be in position 2 or 3.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we have A, I, O, D as confirmed letters. That's 4 letters, so the word must be composed of these 4 and one more letter? Or could there be duplicates? We don't know, but so far we have 4 distinct letters: A, I, O, D.

The secret word: A _ _ I _

We need to fill the second, third, and fifth positions.

But we know O and D are in the word, so they must occupy two of the three blank positions: 2, 3, 5.

Constraints:
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AVOID, it was in position 3 and got '-', so wrong position).
- D cannot be in position 5 (from AVOID, it was in position 5 and got '-', so wrong position).

Therefore, for O: possible positions are 2 or 5.
For D: possible positions are 2 or 3.

But position 2 can only hold one letter. So we have two cases:

Case 1: O in position 2, then D must be in position 3 (since it can't be in 5, and 2 is taken by O, 1 and 4 taken, so only 3 or 5, but 5 is still available but D cannot be in 5, so D must be in 3). Then position 5 must be the fifth letter, which we don't know yet? But we have only 4 letters so far? Wait, we have A, I, O, D — that's four, and the word has five letters, so there must be one more letter.

Case 2: O in position 5, then D can be in position 2 or 3, and the remaining position (if D in 2, then position 3 is open; if D in 3, then position 2 is open) must be filled by a new letter.

But we also know that O and D are the only other confirmed letters, but there might be a fifth letter that we haven't guessed yet.

In guess 3, we have A, V, O, I, D. We know V is absent, so the secret word has A, I, O, D, and one more letter (since 5 letters total).

So, the secret word has exactly 5 distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have evidence of duplicates.

We'll assume no duplicates for now, but be cautious.

So, the word is: A _ _ I _

We need to assign:
- O to position 2 or 5.
- D to position 2 or 3 (but not 5).
- And there is one more letter, say X, which must be in the remaining position.

Also, the absent letters are: C, R, T, E, P, N, S, V. So we must avoid these.

Now, let's consider the cases:

Case 1: O in position 2.
Then, since O is in 2, and D cannot be in 5, and positions available: 3 and 5. But D cannot be in 5, so D must be in 3. Then position 5 must be the new letter X.
So the word is: A O D I X

Case 2: O in position 5.
Then, D can be in 2 or 3.
  - Subcase 2a: D in position 2. Then position 3 is X. Word: A D X I O
  - Subcase 2b: D in position 3. Then position 2 is X. Word: A X D I O

We also know that O is in the word and not in position 3 (which we already accounted for) and D is not in position 5 (also accounted for).

Now, we need to find valid English words that fit these patterns and use only the available letters (avoiding absent ones).

First, Case 1: A O D I X
What words are there? AODIX? Not a word. We need a word starting with ""AODI"" and then a letter. But ""AODI"" is not a common root. Possible? I can't think of any. Let's list possible X.

The word must be A O D I and then a fifth letter. But the fifth letter must be a consonant or vowel? And form a word.

Possible words: I don't know any 5-letter word starting with ""AODI"". For example, ""AODIA"" or something? Not a word. So this case might be invalid.

Therefore, Case 1 (O in 2 and D in 3) is unlikely.

Now, Case 2: O in position 5. So the word ends with I O? Actually, position 4 is I, position 5 is O, so the word ends with ""IO""? But that's unusual for English words. More common is ending with ""IO"" like in audio, but audio is 5 letters: A-U-D-I-O.

Audio! That's a word.

In ""AUDIO"": A-U-D-I-O.
- Position 1: A (correct, we know)
- Position 2: U (new letter)
- Position 3: D (D is in position 3? But we have D in position 3, and in AVOID, D was in position 5 and got '-', meaning D is not in position 5, but it could be in position 3. Also, in AUDIO, D is in position 3, which is allowed because we haven't tested D in position 3 before? We only know D is not in position 5, but it could be in 3.
- Position 4: I (correct)
- Position 5: O (O is in position 5, and we know O is not in position 3, but position 5 is new, so it could be)

Also, check the absent letters: U is not in the absent list (C,R,T,E,P,N,S,V are absent, U is new and allowed).

So ""AUDIO"" is a candidate.

Now, in this case, we have subcase 2b: D in position 3, and position 2 is U.

But we also have subcase 2a: D in position 2. What word would that be? A D ? I O. For example, ""ADRIO"" but R is absent. ""ADMIO"" not a word. ""ADLIB"" but L is allowed, but ""ADLIB"" is 5 letters? A-D-L-I-B, but that ends with B, not O. We need to end with I O? Position 4 is I, position 5 is O, so the last two letters must be I and O in that order.

So words ending with ""IO"" are rare. ""AUDIO"" is one. ""RADIO"" but R is absent. ""AUDIO"" is the most common.

Another one: ""CAMEO"" but C is absent and M? But C is absent. ""VIDEO"" but V is absent. So ""AUDIO"" seems the only common word.

But let's confirm the pattern: A _ _ I O, with the third letter being D? In AUDIO, it's A-U-D-I-O, so second letter U, third D.

We also have the possibility of O in position 5 and D in position 2: A D ? I O. What words? ""ADIOS"" but S is absent. ""ADIEU"" but E is absent and U is used, but E is not allowed. ""ADIEU"" has E. ""ADZIO"" not a word. So no common words with A D ? I O.

Therefore, the only common word that fits is ""AUDIO"".

But we must check if it satisfies all feedback.

Check against feedback:

- A is in position 1: correct, as per AVOID feedback (A✓).
- I is in position 4: correct, as per AVOID (I✓).
- O is in position 5: in AVOID, O was in position 3 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not position 3. In AUDIO, O is in position 5, which is fine.
- D is in position 3: in AVOID, D was in position 5 and got '-', meaning it's in the word but not position 5. In AUDIO, D is in position 3, which is a different position, so it should be okay.

Also, the letter U is new and not in the absent list.

Absent letters: we have C,R,T,E,P,N,S,V absent. U is not in that list, so it's allowed.

Therefore, ""AUDIO"" is a valid candidate and likely the secret word.

But we need to make a guess. Since it fits perfectly, we can guess ""AUDIO"".

But note: in the feedback for AVOID, we have D(-) meaning D is in the word but not in position 5. In AUDIO, D is in position 3, which is consistent.

Similarly, O(-) in AVOID (position 3) and in AUDIO it's in 5, so also consistent.

And we have no other constraints.

So, we should guess ""AUDIO"".

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What if the word has a duplicate? For example, could there be two O's? But we don't have evidence. In AUDIO, all letters are distinct.

Another word: ""AULOI"" — not a common word. ""AULOI"" is plural of aulos, but rare. And it has O in position 5 and I in 4, but A U L O I: L is new, but we can check. But ""AULOI"" is not common.

""JUDIO"" — J is new, but J-U-D-I-O, and U and D, but J not absent? But we don't know J, but it's less common. And ""JUDIO"" is not a standard word.

So, ""AUDIO"" is the best guess.

Therefore, we guess ""AUDIO"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses, we can deduce the following:

- **A** is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 1 (from Guess 3: A(✓)).
- **I** is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4 (from Guess 3: I(✓)).
- **O** is in the secret word but not in position 3 (from Guess 3: O(-)).
- **D** is in the secret word but not in position 5 (from Guess 3: D(-)).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, T, E, P, N, S, V (from all feedback, marked as ""x"").
- The secret word pattern is: `A _ _ I _`.

Given the constraints:
- **O** must be in position 2 or 5 (since position 1 is taken by A, position 4 is taken by I, and it cannot be in position 3).
- **D** must be in position 2 or 3 (since position 1 and 4 are taken, and it cannot be in position 5).
- The word must include one additional letter (since A, I, O, and D account for 4 letters, but the word has 5 positions).
- All letters must avoid the absent list (C, R, T, E, P, N, S, V).

After evaluating possible words that fit the pattern `A _ _ I _` and satisfy the constraints, the word **""AUDIO""** emerges as the strongest candidate:
- It matches the pattern: `A U D I O`.
- **A** is in position 1 (correct, as known).
- **I** is in position 4 (correct, as known).
- **O** is in position 5 (valid, since it cannot be in position 3, and position 5 is untested).
- **D** is in position 3 (valid, since it cannot be in position 5, and position 3 is untested).
- **U** is a new, untested letter (not in the absent list).
- ""AUDIO"" is a common English word, avoiding all absent letters.

This guess will confirm the positions of O and D while testing the new letter U. If correct, it solves the puzzle.",Guess 4: AUDIO -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) U(✓) D(✓) I(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
