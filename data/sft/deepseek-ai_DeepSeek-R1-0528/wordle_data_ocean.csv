We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions.
A good starting word is one that has common vowels and common consonants. ""ARISE"" is a popular choice as it contains five distinct letters including three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

So, our first guess: ARISE

But note: we must think step by step.

Steps:
1. We have no previous feedback, so we choose a starting word that maximizes information gain.
2. ""ARISE"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and has no repeating letters.

Therefore, we output:
<guess>ARISE</guess>
</think>
<thought>
For the first guess in Wordle, choosing a word with common vowels and consonants maximizes the chances of getting useful feedback. A strong starting word is:

- ""ROATE"": This word includes common letters (R, O, A, T, E) and provides balanced coverage of vowels (O, A, E) and consonants (R, T). It often appears in first-guess strategies because it tests multiple frequent letters in English.

Alternative common starters include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ARISE"", but ""ROATE"" has slightly better letter-frequency coverage based on Wordle data analysis.

Since this is the first guess, there's no prior feedback to consider. The goal is to gather initial clues efficiently.

We have feedback from the first guess: ARISE -> A(-), R(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)
This means:
- A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the last position.

So, the secret word contains A and E, but not R, I, or S.

Since A is present but not in position 1, and E is present but not in position 5, we need to consider other positions for them.

We also know that the word does not contain R, I, S.

For the next guess, we should:
- Avoid using R, I, S.
- Include A and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively (since they were misplaced there).
- Try to cover other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, etc.

We have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and avoid R, I, S.

Possible positions for A: it can be in positions 2,3,4,5 (but not 1). However, since E is in the word and not in 5, and A is not in 1, we can try to put A in a different position.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us that A cannot be in position 5, only that it wasn't in position 1. Similarly, E can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

We should also consider that the word might have repeated letters, but since we don't have any indication of that yet, we can assume no repeats for now.

Let's list some words that fit:
- Must include A and E.
- Exclude R, I, S.

Possible words: 
- ""LATEN"" - but that's not very common? 
- ""LEANT"" - but we don't know if L, N, T are in the word.
- ""OCEAN"" - but O, C, N might be present? However, note that ""OCEAN"" has O in position 1, which we don't know about.

But we need to maximize information. Since we know A and E are present, we can try to place them in new positions and test other common letters.

We have two known letters: A and E. We need to find their positions and the other three letters.

We can try a word that puts A in position 2 and E in position 4, for example, and use new letters.

But let's think of common words.

Another idea: use a word that has A and E and three new consonants.

For example: ""TABLE"" - but B, L, and T are new. However, note that in ""TABLE"", A is in position 2 and E is in position 5. But our feedback said E is not in position 5, so we cannot put E in position 5. Therefore, ""TABLE"" is invalid because it has E in 5.

Similarly, ""CAUSE"" has E in 5, which is invalid.

We need a word with E not in 5 and A not in 1.

Let's try to put A in position 2 and E in position 3? Or position 4?

Example: ""HAVEN"" - H, V, N are new. But H is not very common? Also, we don't know if H, V, N are in the word.

But we are trying to test new letters.

Another word: ""LATER"" - but R is not in the word (from feedback), so we cannot use R. So ""LATER"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""RASPY"" has R and S, which are excluded.

We must avoid R, I, S.

Let me think of words without R, I, S and with A and E, and E not at the end.

Possible words:
- ""ALONE"": A in position 1? But feedback said A is not in position 1, so we cannot put A in 1. So ""ALONE"" is invalid because A is in 1.
- ""LEMON"": no A? We need A.
- ""MANGE"": M, N, G, E. A is in position 2? But ""MANGE"" has A in 2 and E in 5? E in 5 is not allowed because feedback said E is not in position 5.

We need E not in 5.

So, words with E in positions 1,2,3,4.

Examples:
- E in 1: ""EAGLE"" - but A is in 2, which is new. But ""EAGLE"" has G, L. Also, E in 1 is allowed. But we have A in 2? We don't know if that's correct. However, we are testing. But note: we have to avoid R? ""EAGLE"" has no R, I, S? It has E, A, G, L, E? Wait, ""EAGLE"" has two E's? Let me check: E-A-G-L-E. So E is repeated? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, the feedback for ARISE had only one E and it was marked as present but wrong position, so if the word has two E's, that might be possible. But in our case, we don't have information about duplicates.

But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""ELAND"" - E in 1, A in 3? But ""ELAND"" is an animal, might be obscure.

Common words: ""PLANE"" - but E is in 5, which is not allowed.

""ADOBE"" - A in 1? Not allowed because A cannot be in 1. Also, E in 5? Not allowed.

""CAKED"" - C, K, E, D. A in 2? But E is in 4? That might work. ""CAKED"": C-A-K-E-D. So A is in 2, E in 4. And we avoid R,I,S. But we don't know about C,K,D.

Another: ""BAKED"" - similar, B instead of C.

But let's think of a word that has E in a position other than 5 and A not in 1.

""HASTE"" - but S is excluded, so no.

""PAVED"" - P, V, E, D. A in 2, E in 4? But P and V are less common.

""NAVEL"" - N, V, E, L. A in 2, E in 4? And L at the end.

But we can use ""NAVEL"".

Another common word: ""LATTE"" - but T repeated, and E in 5? Not allowed.

""OAKEN"" - O, K, E, N. A in 2, E in 4? ""OAKEN"": O-A-K-E-N. So E is in 4? Yes, position 4. And A in 2. This seems valid.

But ""OAKEN"" is not very common? Maybe ""BAKER"" but R is excluded.

""MAKER"" has R, excluded.

""WAVED"" - W, V, E, D. A in 2, E in 4.

But let's choose a word that uses more common letters.

Another idea: ""CANOE"" - but E in 5? Not allowed.

""ALIVE"" - A in 1? Not allowed, and I is excluded.

""AGLEE"" - obscure.

Perhaps ""TALON"" - but no E? We need E.

We must include E.

Let me list: 
- Position for A: 2,3,4,5
- Position for E: 1,2,3,4

And we need three other letters that are not R,I,S.

Common letters left: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, etc.

A good word might be ""OCTAL"" but no E.

""ADIEU"" - but I is excluded, and A in 1? Not allowed.

""MEDIA"" - M, E, D, I, A. But I is excluded, and E in 1? But I is not allowed. Also, A in 5? That might be possible, but I is invalid.

So avoid I.

Another word: ""ULNAE"" - obscure.

Perhaps ""DANCE"" - but E in 5? Not allowed.

""DEALT"" - D, E, A, L, T. E in 1, A in 3? And T at the end. This seems good: 
- E in position 1: allowed because feedback only said E is not in 5, but it can be in 1.
- A in position 3: not position 1, so allowed.

Also, D, L, T are new letters.

So ""DEALT"": D-E-A-L-T.

This uses E in 1, A in 3, and avoids R,I,S.

We can also test D, L, T.

So I think ""DEALT"" is a good second guess.

After this, we will get feedback on:
- D: if it's in the word and position
- E: if it's in the correct position (position 1) or not
- A: if it's in the correct position (position 3) or not
- L: new letter
- T: new letter

This should give us good information.

Therefore, we choose ""DEALT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""ARISE"":
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (A(-)).
- R, I, and S are not in the word at all (R(x), I(x), S(x)).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (E(-)).

This means:
- The secret word contains A and E, but excludes R, I, and S.
- A cannot be in position 1, and E cannot be in position 5.
- The positions of A and E are still unknown, so the next guess should test new positions for A and E while introducing new common letters to gather more information.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using R, I, or S.
- Include A and E, but place A in a position other than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5) and E in a position other than 5 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, N, L, D, O, C) to maximize information gain.
- ""DEALT"" is a strong choice because:
  - It places E in position 1 (testing if E is correctly placed there).
  - It places A in position 3 (testing a new position for A).
  - It introduces three new common letters: D (position 1), L (position 4), and T (position 5).
  - It avoids R, I, S, and fits the feedback constraints.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and E and reveal whether D, L, or T are in the word.

So, the secret word contains A and E, but not R, I, or S.

Since A is present but not in position 1, and E is present but not in position 5, we need to consider other positions for them.

We also know that the word does not contain R, I, S.

- A in position 3: not position 1, so allowed.

Also, D, L, T are new letters.

So ""DEALT"": D-E-A-L-T.

This uses E in 1, A in 3, and avoids R,I,S.

We can also test D, L, T.

So I think ""DEALT"" is a good second guess.

After this, we will get feedback on:

This means:
- The secret word contains A and E, but excludes R, I, and S.

- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, N, L, D, O, C) to maximize information gain.
- ""DEALT"" is a strong choice because:
  - It places E in position 1 (testing if E is correctly placed there).
  - It places A in position 3 (testing a new position for A).
  - It introduces three new common letters: D (position 1), L (position 4), and T (position 5).
  - It avoids R, I, S, and fits the feedback constraints.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and E and reveal whether D, L, or T are in the word.",Guess 2: DEALT -> FEEDBACK: D(x) E(-) A(-) L(x) T(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,ocean,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that covers common letters and positions.
A good starting word is one that has common vowels and common consonants. ""ARISE"" is a popular choice as it contains five distinct letters including three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).

So, our first guess: ARISE

But note: we must think step by step.

Steps:
1. We have no previous feedback, so we choose a starting word that maximizes information gain.
2. ""ARISE"" is a good candidate because it uses common letters and has no repeating letters.

Therefore, we output:
<guess>ARISE</guess><thought>
For the first guess in Wordle, choosing a word with common vowels and consonants maximizes the chances of getting useful feedback. A strong starting word is:

- ""ROATE"": This word includes common letters (R, O, A, T, E) and provides balanced coverage of vowels (O, A, E) and consonants (R, T). It often appears in first-guess strategies because it tests multiple frequent letters in English.

Alternative common starters include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", or ""ARISE"", but ""ROATE"" has slightly better letter-frequency coverage based on Wordle data analysis.

Since this is the first guess, there's no prior feedback to consider. The goal is to gather initial clues efficiently.

<guess>ARISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ARISE -> A(-), R(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)
This means:
- A is in the word but not in the first position.
- R is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the last position.

So, the secret word contains A and E, but not R, I, or S.

Since A is present but not in position 1, and E is present but not in position 5, we need to consider other positions for them.

We also know that the word does not contain R, I, S.

For the next guess, we should:
- Avoid using R, I, S.
- Include A and E, but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively (since they were misplaced there).
- Try to cover other common letters to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried yet: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, etc.

We have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

Let's think of words that have A and E, and avoid R, I, S.

Possible positions for A: it can be in positions 2,3,4,5 (but not 1). However, since E is in the word and not in 5, and A is not in 1, we can try to put A in a different position.

But note: the feedback doesn't tell us that A cannot be in position 5, only that it wasn't in position 1. Similarly, E can be in positions 1,2,3,4.

We should also consider that the word might have repeated letters, but since we don't have any indication of that yet, we can assume no repeats for now.

Let's list some words that fit:
- Must include A and E.
- Exclude R, I, S.

Possible words: 
- ""LATEN"" - but that's not very common? 
- ""LEANT"" - but we don't know if L, N, T are in the word.
- ""OCEAN"" - but O, C, N might be present? However, note that ""OCEAN"" has O in position 1, which we don't know about.

But we need to maximize information. Since we know A and E are present, we can try to place them in new positions and test other common letters.

We have two known letters: A and E. We need to find their positions and the other three letters.

We can try a word that puts A in position 2 and E in position 4, for example, and use new letters.

But let's think of common words.

Another idea: use a word that has A and E and three new consonants.

For example: ""TABLE"" - but B, L, and T are new. However, note that in ""TABLE"", A is in position 2 and E is in position 5. But our feedback said E is not in position 5, so we cannot put E in position 5. Therefore, ""TABLE"" is invalid because it has E in 5.

Similarly, ""CAUSE"" has E in 5, which is invalid.

We need a word with E not in 5 and A not in 1.

Let's try to put A in position 2 and E in position 3? Or position 4?

Example: ""HAVEN"" - H, V, N are new. But H is not very common? Also, we don't know if H, V, N are in the word.

But we are trying to test new letters.

Another word: ""LATER"" - but R is not in the word (from feedback), so we cannot use R. So ""LATER"" is invalid.

Similarly, ""RASPY"" has R and S, which are excluded.

We must avoid R, I, S.

Let me think of words without R, I, S and with A and E, and E not at the end.

Possible words:
- ""ALONE"": A in position 1? But feedback said A is not in position 1, so we cannot put A in 1. So ""ALONE"" is invalid because A is in 1.
- ""LEMON"": no A? We need A.
- ""MANGE"": M, N, G, E. A is in position 2? But ""MANGE"" has A in 2 and E in 5? E in 5 is not allowed because feedback said E is not in position 5.

We need E not in 5.

So, words with E in positions 1,2,3,4.

Examples:
- E in 1: ""EAGLE"" - but A is in 2, which is new. But ""EAGLE"" has G, L. Also, E in 1 is allowed. But we have A in 2? We don't know if that's correct. However, we are testing. But note: we have to avoid R? ""EAGLE"" has no R, I, S? It has E, A, G, L, E? Wait, ""EAGLE"" has two E's? Let me check: E-A-G-L-E. So E is repeated? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters. However, the feedback for ARISE had only one E and it was marked as present but wrong position, so if the word has two E's, that might be possible. But in our case, we don't have information about duplicates.

But to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""ELAND"" - E in 1, A in 3? But ""ELAND"" is an animal, might be obscure.

Common words: ""PLANE"" - but E is in 5, which is not allowed.

""ADOBE"" - A in 1? Not allowed because A cannot be in 1. Also, E in 5? Not allowed.

""CAKED"" - C, K, E, D. A in 2? But E is in 4? That might work. ""CAKED"": C-A-K-E-D. So A is in 2, E in 4. And we avoid R,I,S. But we don't know about C,K,D.

Another: ""BAKED"" - similar, B instead of C.

But let's think of a word that has E in a position other than 5 and A not in 1.

""HASTE"" - but S is excluded, so no.

""PAVED"" - P, V, E, D. A in 2, E in 4? But P and V are less common.

""NAVEL"" - N, V, E, L. A in 2, E in 4? And L at the end.

But we can use ""NAVEL"".

Another common word: ""LATTE"" - but T repeated, and E in 5? Not allowed.

""OAKEN"" - O, K, E, N. A in 2, E in 4? ""OAKEN"": O-A-K-E-N. So E is in 4? Yes, position 4. And A in 2. This seems valid.

But ""OAKEN"" is not very common? Maybe ""BAKER"" but R is excluded.

""MAKER"" has R, excluded.

""WAVED"" - W, V, E, D. A in 2, E in 4.

But let's choose a word that uses more common letters.

Another idea: ""CANOE"" - but E in 5? Not allowed.

""ALIVE"" - A in 1? Not allowed, and I is excluded.

""AGLEE"" - obscure.

Perhaps ""TALON"" - but no E? We need E.

We must include E.

Let me list: 
- Position for A: 2,3,4,5
- Position for E: 1,2,3,4

And we need three other letters that are not R,I,S.

Common letters left: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, P, M, etc.

A good word might be ""OCTAL"" but no E.

""ADIEU"" - but I is excluded, and A in 1? Not allowed.

""MEDIA"" - M, E, D, I, A. But I is excluded, and E in 1? But I is not allowed. Also, A in 5? That might be possible, but I is invalid.

So avoid I.

Another word: ""ULNAE"" - obscure.

Perhaps ""DANCE"" - but E in 5? Not allowed.

""DEALT"" - D, E, A, L, T. E in 1, A in 3? And T at the end. This seems good: 
- E in position 1: allowed because feedback only said E is not in 5, but it can be in 1.
- A in position 3: not position 1, so allowed.

Also, D, L, T are new letters.

So ""DEALT"": D-E-A-L-T.

This uses E in 1, A in 3, and avoids R,I,S.

We can also test D, L, T.

So I think ""DEALT"" is a good second guess.

After this, we will get feedback on:
- D: if it's in the word and position
- E: if it's in the correct position (position 1) or not
- A: if it's in the correct position (position 3) or not
- L: new letter
- T: new letter

This should give us good information.

Therefore, we choose ""DEALT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""ARISE"":
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (A(-)).
- R, I, and S are not in the word at all (R(x), I(x), S(x)).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (E(-)).

This means:
- The secret word contains A and E, but excludes R, I, and S.
- A cannot be in position 1, and E cannot be in position 5.
- The positions of A and E are still unknown, so the next guess should test new positions for A and E while introducing new common letters to gather more information.

For the second guess:
- Avoid using R, I, or S.
- Include A and E, but place A in a position other than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5) and E in a position other than 5 (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4).
- Prioritize common unused letters (e.g., T, N, L, D, O, C) to maximize information gain.
- ""DEALT"" is a strong choice because:
  - It places E in position 1 (testing if E is correctly placed there).
  - It places A in position 3 (testing a new position for A).
  - It introduces three new common letters: D (position 1), L (position 4), and T (position 5).
  - It avoids R, I, S, and fits the feedback constraints.

This guess will help narrow down the positions of A and E and reveal whether D, L, or T are in the word.

We have two sets of feedback:

From Guess 1 (ARISE):
- A: present but not in position 1 (so A is in the word, but not at index 0)
- R: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present but not in position 4 (so E is in the word, but not at index 4)

From Guess 2 (DEALT):
- D: absent
- E: present but not in position 1 (so E is in the word, but not at index 1)
- A: present but not in position 2 (so A is in the word, but not at index 2)
- L: absent
- T: absent

Now, combining the information:

1. The word contains A and E, but we don't know their positions yet.
   - A cannot be in position 0 (from ARISE) or position 2 (from DEALT).
   - E cannot be in position 4 (from ARISE) or position 1 (from DEALT).

2. The following letters are absent: R, I, S, D, L, T.

3. Therefore, the word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, I, S, D, L, T.

4. We know the word has 5 letters, with A and E being two of them. So there are three more letters to find, which must be from the remaining set.

Let's list the letters that are still possible. The alphabet without the absent ones: 
Absent: R, I, S, D, L, T
So available: A, B, C, E, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A and E are already in the word, so the other three letters must be from the available set excluding A and E? Not necessarily, because A and E might be repeated? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of that yet. So we should consider the possibility of duplicates, but without feedback suggesting duplicates, we might assume no duplicates for now.

But the feedback doesn't show any duplicate marks, so we'll proceed under the assumption that all letters are unique.

Therefore, the word has A, E, and three other distinct letters from the available set.

Now, positions constraints for A and E:
- A cannot be in position 0 or 2 -> possible positions: 1, 3, 4
- E cannot be in position 1 or 4 -> possible positions: 0, 2, 3

But note: the word has 5 positions: 0,1,2,3,4.

We need to think of words that have A and E, with A in {1,3,4} and E in {0,2,3}, and the other three letters from the available set (excluding D,L,T,R,I,S and including only the ones not used).

Also, we have to avoid the absent letters: R,I,S,D,L,T.

Now, let's think of possible words.

We can try to use a word that tests common letters from the available set and places A and E in new positions.

Common letters left: O, U, N, C, M, P, etc.

We also want to test positions for A and E that we haven't tried.

So far, we have tested:
- A in position 0 (in ARISE) and position 2 (in DEALT) -> both wrong.
- E in position 4 (in ARISE) and position 1 (in DEALT) -> both wrong.

So for A, we haven't tried positions 1, 3, or 4.
For E, we haven't tried positions 0, 2, or 3.

But note: in DEALT, we put E in position 1 and it was wrong, so E cannot be in 1. Similarly, in ARISE, E was in 4 and wrong, so E cannot be in 4.

So E must be in 0, 2, or 3.

Similarly, A must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to choose a word that:
- Includes A and E (since they are in the word) and three new letters.
- Places A in one of {1,3,4} and E in one of {0,2,3}.
- Avoids the absent letters: R,I,S,D,L,T.

Let's try to cover common letters. The most common remaining consonants and vowels: O, U, N, C, M, P, B, etc.

A good candidate might be ""OUNCE"" but let's check:
- O, U, N, C, E -> E is at the end (position 4), but E cannot be in 4. So invalid.

""MANGE"" -> E in 4, invalid.

""PANCE"" -> not a word.

How about ""OAKEN""? But we have T absent, and ""OAKEN"" has no T? Actually, ""OAKEN"" is a word? But let's see: O-A-K-E-N. E is in position 3? Positions: 0:O, 1:A, 2:K, 3:E, 4:N. But A is in position 1, which is allowed (since A can be in 1,3,4). E is in position 3, which is allowed (E can be in 0,2,3). And the letters: O, A, K, E, N. Check absent: R,I,S,D,L,T are absent, and none of these are in OAKEN. So OAKEN is a valid guess.

But we don't know if O, K, N are in the word. We are testing them.

Another word: ""BAKEN"" not a word.

""CAKEN"" not a word.

""MAVEN"": M-A-V-E-N. A in 1, E in 3. Positions: 0:M, 1:A, 2:V, 3:E, 4:N. So A in 1 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed). Letters: M, A, V, E, N. Absent letters not included. So ""MAVEN"" is a word.

But ""MAVEN"" might be less common. ""OAKEN"" is also acceptable.

Another common word: ""OCEAN"" but E is in 4? O-C-E-A-N: E is at position 2? Let's index: 0:O, 1:C, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N. So E in 2 (allowed), A in 3 (allowed). And letters: O, C, E, A, N. No absent letters. So ""OCEAN"" is a good candidate.

""OCEAN"" has E in position 2 and A in position 3, both of which are new positions we haven't tested for A and E.

Also, it tests O, C, and N, which are common letters.

So ""OCEAN"" seems like a strong guess.

But let's see if there are other options.

""AVENUE"" is 6 letters, too long.

""HAVEN"" has E in 4? H-A-V-E-N: E in 3? 0:H,1:A,2:V,3:E,4:N -> E in 3, which is allowed. But we already have ""MAVEN"" similar.

But ""OCEAN"" tests more common letters.

Another word: ""BEACH"" but B is available, but E in 1? We put E in 1 in DEALT and it was wrong, so E cannot be in 1. In ""BEACH"": B-E-A-C-H, E is in 1, which is not allowed (since we know E is not in position 1). So invalid.

""PEACH"" same issue.

""PECAN"" -> P-E-C-A-N: E in 1, which is not allowed.

""CANOE"" -> C-A-N-O-E: E in 4, not allowed.

So ""OCEAN"" seems good.

But what about ""OUNCE""? E in 4, not allowed.

""ANODE"" -> A in 0? But A cannot be in 0 (from ARISE feedback). Also, E in 4 not allowed.

""ADOBE"" -> A in 0 and E in 4, both invalid.

So, I think ""OCEAN"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, we'll guess ""OCEAN"".

But let's double-check the positions for A and E in ""OCEAN"":
- O in 0
- C in 1
- E in 2
- A in 3
- N in 4

So A is in position 3 (which is allowed: 1,3,4) and E is in position 2 (which is allowed: 0,2,3). Perfect.

And we test O, C, and N.

So, next guess: OCEAN
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ARISE** → A(-), R(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  
  - A and E are in the word but not in positions 1 or 5, respectively.  
  - R, I, S are absent.  

- **Guess 2: DEALT** → D(x), E(-), A(-), L(x), T(x)  
  - E and A are in the word but not in positions 2 or 3, respectively.  
  - D, L, T are absent.  

### Key Insights:
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: A and E.  
- **Absent letters**: R, I, S, D, L, T (cannot appear in the word).  
- **Position constraints for A**: Cannot be in position 1 (from ARISE) or 3 (from DEALT), so must be in position 2, 4, or 5.  
- **Position constraints for E**: Cannot be in position 5 (from ARISE) or 2 (from DEALT), so must be in position 1, 3, or 4.  
- **Remaining letters to test**: Focus on common letters not yet tried, such as O, C, N, M, P, U, B, etc.  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- **Include A and E** in new positions:  
  - Test A in position 4 or 5 (since position 2 was tested in DEALT and ruled out).  
  - Test E in position 1, 3, or 4 (position 2 was tested in DEALT and ruled out).  
- **Avoid absent letters** (R, I, S, D, L, T).  
- **Prioritize high-frequency unused letters** like O, C, and N to maximize information.  
- **Strong candidate: OCEAN**  
  - O in position 1, C in position 2, E in position 3, A in position 4, N in position 5.  
  - A is in position 4 (new, untested position).  
  - E is in position 3 (new, untested position).  
  - Tests O, C, and N—all common letters not yet evaluated.  

This guess efficiently narrows down the positions of A and E while probing new letters.

<guess>OCEAN</guess>",OCEAN,"We have two sets of feedback:

From Guess 1 (ARISE):
- A: present but not in position 1 (so A is in the word, but not at index 0)
- R: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present but not in position 4 (so E is in the word, but not at index 4)

From Guess 2 (DEALT):
- D: absent
- E: present but not in position 1 (so E is in the word, but not at index 1)
- A: present but not in position 2 (so A is in the word, but not at index 2)
- L: absent
- T: absent

Now, combining the information:

1. The word contains A and E, but we don't know their positions yet.
   - A cannot be in position 0 (from ARISE) or position 2 (from DEALT).
   - E cannot be in position 4 (from ARISE) or position 1 (from DEALT).

2. The following letters are absent: R, I, S, D, L, T.

3. Therefore, the word must consist of letters from the remaining alphabet, excluding R, I, S, D, L, T.

4. We know the word has 5 letters, with A and E being two of them. So there are three more letters to find, which must be from the remaining set.

Let's list the letters that are still possible. The alphabet without the absent ones: 
Absent: R, I, S, D, L, T
So available: A, B, C, E, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: A and E are already in the word, so the other three letters must be from the available set excluding A and E? Not necessarily, because A and E might be repeated? However, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters, but we don't have evidence of that yet. So we should consider the possibility of duplicates, but without feedback suggesting duplicates, we might assume no duplicates for now.

But the feedback doesn't show any duplicate marks, so we'll proceed under the assumption that all letters are unique.

Therefore, the word has A, E, and three other distinct letters from the available set.

Now, positions constraints for A and E:
- A cannot be in position 0 or 2 -> possible positions: 1, 3, 4
- E cannot be in position 1 or 4 -> possible positions: 0, 2, 3

But note: the word has 5 positions: 0,1,2,3,4.

We need to think of words that have A and E, with A in {1,3,4} and E in {0,2,3}, and the other three letters from the available set (excluding D,L,T,R,I,S and including only the ones not used).

Also, we have to avoid the absent letters: R,I,S,D,L,T.

Now, let's think of possible words.

We can try to use a word that tests common letters from the available set and places A and E in new positions.

Common letters left: O, U, N, C, M, P, etc.

We also want to test positions for A and E that we haven't tried.

So far, we have tested:
- A in position 0 (in ARISE) and position 2 (in DEALT) -> both wrong.
- E in position 4 (in ARISE) and position 1 (in DEALT) -> both wrong.

So for A, we haven't tried positions 1, 3, or 4.
For E, we haven't tried positions 0, 2, or 3.

But note: in DEALT, we put E in position 1 and it was wrong, so E cannot be in 1. Similarly, in ARISE, E was in 4 and wrong, so E cannot be in 4.

So E must be in 0, 2, or 3.

Similarly, A must be in 1, 3, or 4.

Now, we need to choose a word that:
- Includes A and E (since they are in the word) and three new letters.
- Places A in one of {1,3,4} and E in one of {0,2,3}.
- Avoids the absent letters: R,I,S,D,L,T.

A good candidate might be ""OUNCE"" but let's check:
- O, U, N, C, E -> E is at the end (position 4), but E cannot be in 4. So invalid.

""MANGE"" -> E in 4, invalid.

""PANCE"" -> not a word.

How about ""OAKEN""? But we have T absent, and ""OAKEN"" has no T? Actually, ""OAKEN"" is a word? But let's see: O-A-K-E-N. E is in position 3? Positions: 0:O, 1:A, 2:K, 3:E, 4:N. But A is in position 1, which is allowed (since A can be in 1,3,4). E is in position 3, which is allowed (E can be in 0,2,3). And the letters: O, A, K, E, N. Check absent: R,I,S,D,L,T are absent, and none of these are in OAKEN. So OAKEN is a valid guess.

But we don't know if O, K, N are in the word. We are testing them.

Another word: ""BAKEN"" not a word.

""CAKEN"" not a word.

""MAVEN"": M-A-V-E-N. A in 1, E in 3. Positions: 0:M, 1:A, 2:V, 3:E, 4:N. So A in 1 (allowed), E in 3 (allowed). Letters: M, A, V, E, N. Absent letters not included. So ""MAVEN"" is a word.

But ""MAVEN"" might be less common. ""OAKEN"" is also acceptable.

Another common word: ""OCEAN"" but E is in 4? O-C-E-A-N: E is at position 2? Let's index: 0:O, 1:C, 2:E, 3:A, 4:N. So E in 2 (allowed), A in 3 (allowed). And letters: O, C, E, A, N. No absent letters. So ""OCEAN"" is a good candidate.

""OCEAN"" has E in position 2 and A in position 3, both of which are new positions we haven't tested for A and E.

Also, it tests O, C, and N, which are common letters.

So ""OCEAN"" seems like a strong guess.

But let's see if there are other options.

""AVENUE"" is 6 letters, too long.

""HAVEN"" has E in 4? H-A-V-E-N: E in 3? 0:H,1:A,2:V,3:E,4:N -> E in 3, which is allowed. But we already have ""MAVEN"" similar.

But ""OCEAN"" tests more common letters.

Another word: ""BEACH"" but B is available, but E in 1? We put E in 1 in DEALT and it was wrong, so E cannot be in 1. In ""BEACH"": B-E-A-C-H, E is in 1, which is not allowed (since we know E is not in position 1). So invalid.

""PEACH"" same issue.

""PECAN"" -> P-E-C-A-N: E in 1, which is not allowed.

""CANOE"" -> C-A-N-O-E: E in 4, not allowed.

So ""OCEAN"" seems good.

But what about ""OUNCE""? E in 4, not allowed.

""ANODE"" -> A in 0? But A cannot be in 0 (from ARISE feedback). Also, E in 4 not allowed.

""ADOBE"" -> A in 0 and E in 4, both invalid.

So, I think ""OCEAN"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, we'll guess ""OCEAN"".

But let's double-check the positions for A and E in ""OCEAN"":
- O in 0
- C in 1
- E in 2
- A in 3
- N in 4

So A is in position 3 (which is allowed: 1,3,4) and E is in position 2 (which is allowed: 0,2,3). Perfect.

And we test O, C, and N.

So, next guess: OCEANBased on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ARISE** → A(-), R(x), I(x), S(x), E(-)  
  - A and E are in the word but not in positions 1 or 5, respectively.
