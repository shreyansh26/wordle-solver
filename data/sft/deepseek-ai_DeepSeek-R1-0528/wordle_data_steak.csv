We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given the first guess: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
 This means:
   C: not in the word (x)
   R: not in the word (x)
   A: in the word but wrong position (-)
   N: in the word? Actually, it says (x) so N is not in the word? But wait, let me read carefully: N(x) -> not in the word.
   E: in the word but wrong position (-)

 Correction: The feedback says:
   C: x (not in the word)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: - (in the word, but not in the correct position)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: - (in the word, but not in the correct position)

 So we know:
   Letters in the word: A and E (but not in the positions they were in ""crane"").
   Letters not in the word: C, R, N.

 Positions in the word (from ""crane""):
   Position 1: C -> not in word -> so the word does not start with C.
   Position 2: R -> not in word -> so the second letter isn't R.
   Position 3: A -> is in the word, but not at position 3. So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? Wait, but note: we have 5 positions.
   Position 4: N -> not in word -> so the fourth letter isn't N.
   Position 5: E -> is in the word, but not at position 5. So E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.

 Since we know A and E are in the word, we should try a word that includes A and E (and excludes C, R, N) and places them in different positions.

 Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Possible strategy: choose a word that has A and E in positions that are not 3 and 5 (since we know in ""crane"" they were wrong there) and also include other common letters.

 Since position 3 was A and that was wrong, and position 5 was E and that was wrong, we can try placing A and E elsewhere.

 We must avoid using C, R, N.

 Consider: 
   A cannot be at position 3? Actually, it can be elsewhere. But note, the ""-"" means it is in the word but not at that position. So A could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But wait, we have:
   Position 1: cannot be C (we know) and also note that A might be there? But we don't know yet.

 However, note that the word has 5 letters and we know two of them: A and E. And we have three unknown letters.

 We should choose a word that:
   - Includes A and E (but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively? Not necessarily, because if the word has duplicate letters then it might be, but we don't know. However, the feedback for ""crane"" doesn't indicate duplicates. Since A and E were marked as present only once, and in the wrong positions, we assume that at least one A and one E are present. But there could be duplicates? We don't know. But for the next guess, let's assume no duplicates to maximize coverage.

 Also, we want to test other vowels or common consonants.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, P, etc.

 Let me think of words that have A and E, and don't have C, R, N.

 Example: ""LATER"", ""SLATE"", ""LEAST"", etc.

 However, note:
   In ""crane"", the A was at position 3 and E at position 5. So we must move them.

 How about a word where A is at position 1? Then E cannot be at position 5? But E can be anywhere except 5? Actually, we know for the first guess that E was at position 5 and was wrong. That does not prevent E from being at position 5 in the actual word? Wait, no: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, E cannot be at position 5. Similarly, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position, so A cannot be at position 3.

 Therefore:
   Positions where A can be: 1, 2, 4
   Positions where E can be: 1, 2, 3, 4

 Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.

 Let me pick a word that uses common letters and places A and E in new positions.

 Consider ""SLATE"":
   S at position 1, L at 2, A at 3? Wait, but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because the feedback for the first guess said A was at position 3 and was wrong? Actually, no: the first guess had A at position 3 and we were told it's not there. So in ""SLATE"", putting A at position 3 is the same position? That would still be wrong? But we want to test A at a new position.

 Alternatively, ""LEAST"":
   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 for A? Not allowed? Actually, we can try A at a new position? But we know that A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 again, and the word has A, it would still be marked as ""-"" because it's at the same wrong position? Then we won't get new information? Better to move it.

 So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

 How about ""PLATE"":
   P at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Again position 3? Let me avoid.

 How about ""TALES"":
   T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> this puts A at 2 (which is different from 3) and E at 4 (different from 5). Also, avoids positions that we know are incorrect.

 Also, note: in ""crane"", position 1: C (not in word) -> so we can replace C with T or S, etc.

 Let me write the word: TALES
 But does it use any forbidden letters? C, R, N -> no. So it's okay.

 How about ""STALE""?
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 -> we don't want that if we can avoid.

 How about ""STEAL""?
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> this puts E at position 3 and A at position 4 (both new positions). And E is not at 5? And A not at 3? Actually, E at 3? We don't know if position 3 is available for E? We know E is not at 5, but it can be at 3? Yes, because we've never tested it at 3? Actually, we tested E at position 5 and it was wrong, but not at 3? So that's new.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses A at position 1 and E at position 2? For example, ""ADIEU""? But ADIEU has D and I, and also E is at position 4? Actually:
   ""ADIEU"": A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5 -> and E is at 4? But we also noted we haven't tested U? It's a vowel but not super common.

 However, ""STEAL"" seems better because it uses more common letters? But note that we have to avoid R, C, N. And we include S, T, E, A, L.

 Also, ""STEAL"" might help us if we get feedback on S, T, L.

 Another candidate: ""SLATE"" with A at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we shouldn't put it at 3 again? Because then we already know that if A is in the word, it's not at 3. Therefore, putting it at 3 again would still be wrong? And we don't learn anything? Actually, we might: if we put A at 3 again and we get a ""-"", that tells us that indeed it's in the word? Wait, we already know that. So we don't get new information on the position.

 Hence, we should try A at a position we haven't tested. Similarly for E.

 So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

 How about ""STALE""? That has A at 3 -> avoid.
 How about ""SLATE"" with A at 3 -> avoid.

 Alternatively, ""LEAFS"" (if valid): L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again position 3? Avoid.

 How about ""ADIEU""? 
   A: position 1 -> new position for A (since only tested at 3 before) -> good.
   E: position 4 -> new position (since tested only at 5) -> good.
   Also, we get to test D, I, U.

 However, U is less common? And we might want more common letters.

 How about ""PASTE""?
   P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but we know E cannot be at 5? So if we put E at 5, and the word has E, then we expect a ""-"" for E? But that's the same as before? So we don't learn if E can be at 5? Actually, we know already that E is not at 5? Then it must be elsewhere? Therefore, putting E at 5 again is futile? Because we already know it's not there? And we get a ""-"" if E is in the word? But that doesn't tell us where it might be? So we waste that slot.

 Therefore, we want E at a position that is not 5? And A at a position that is not 3? So ""PASTE"" has A at 2? That's a new position? But E at 5? We should avoid.

 How about ""STEAK"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, K at 5 -> this avoids A at 3? And E not at 5? Actually E is at 3? A at 4? Both new positions? And K is a common consonant.

 But note: we must avoid letters C, R, N -> and ""STEAK"" does not have them.

 So yes.

 Alternatively, ""STEAM"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, M at 5 -> same issue? E at 3? Then we might get new information? And we test M at 5? But M hasn't been tested? And E at position 3 is new? Because first guess we only had E at 5? So we don't know about position 3? Correct.

 However, note that the word does not have R, C, N? Both STEAM and STEAK are acceptable.

 But STEAM has M? We haven't tested M? So we can learn something.

 How about ""PLANE""? But it has N? Which we know is not in the word? But wait: first feedback says N is not in the word? So we shouldn't use N.

 Therefore, we must avoid N? So ""PLANE"" is invalid.

 Let me decide: I think ""TALES"" is a good candidate? 
   T at 1? We haven't tested position 1? 
   A at 2? New? 
   L at 3? 
   E at 4? New? 
   S at 5?

 But note: in the feedback, we don't know anything about position 1? Only that C was there and is wrong? So we can put T there? And since T is a common starting letter.

 Also, ""TALES"" contains:
   T: not tested before? 
   A: present, at position 2? 
   L: not tested? 
   E: present, at position 4? 
   S: not tested?

 We avoid C, R, N? Yes.

 But what if we get: A at position 2? What if the actual A is not at 2? Then we get ""A"" as ""-""? But we already know A is present? Then we know it's not at 2? Similarly for E? Then we get information? Actually, we would know that A is not at 2? And E not at 4? Then we can narrow down.

 Alternatively, we can maximize coverage: we have A and E to be placed in positions that are new? And three new letters: T, L, S.

 Also, we can consider: if the word has A at position 1, then we are not testing that? So maybe we can try including position 1? But we have T at 1? So if we get a ✓ on T? Then we know? Or if we get a ""-""? Then we know T is in the word? Etc.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but move A? We can't? Because we can't control? Or can we? We have to choose a word? How about ""SALET"" (if valid)? 
   S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> similar to TALES? And A at 2, E at 4.

 But SALET is a word? Yes, it's an old term for a helmet? But accepted in Wordle? Depends? But I think it is.

 However, TALES is more common.

 Another word: ""TEALS"" — teal is a color, plural? TEALS? Might not be accepted? So stick to TALES?

 But let me confirm: TALES is valid.

 So I'll go with ""TALES"".

 However, note: we have two words: TALES and STEAL? Which one? 
   STEAL: S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5? Then A is at 4? And E at 3? Both new? So why not STEAL?

 Actually, STEAL is a very common word. Also, S, T, E, A, L — same letters? Just arranged differently.

 But in STEAL: S at 1, T at 2? Which we haven't tested? And E at 3 (new position), A at 4 (new), L at 5? 
 We also avoid C, R, N? Yes.

 The advantage of STEAL: 
   Position 1: we test S? Which is a very common letter? And T next? 
   And A we get to put at 4? And E at 3? 

 But note: we already know A is present? So if we put A at 4? And if it's the correct location? We get a ✓? Or if it's not? Then we know it's elsewhere? Similarly for E? 

 Also, we get to test L at position 5? Which hasn't been tested? 

 How about compared to TALES? 
   TALES: position 1 is T? Then A at 2? Then E at 4? L at 3? S at 5? 

 Both arrangements are good? 

 But in the first guess, we tested letter E at position 5? And got ""-""? So if we put L at position 5? How do we know? We don't? But we'll test it? 

 Alternatively: the word has exactly 5 letters? And we know two: A and E? So three unknown? 

 Both STEAL and TALES test three new letters? So same? 

 How about frequency? 
   S is very common? T too? L less than S? So STEAL might be better because S is at the beginning? 

 But note: in the first guess, we didn't have S or T? So we are testing high-frequency letters? 

 However, STEAL has S and T at positions 1 and 2? Both common? 

 Also, STEAL the word is standard? 

 I'll choose STEAL? But wait: in STEAL, E is at position 3? We don't know? But in the actual word? We don't know? So it's good.

 But note: we must be able to interpret? 

 Alternatively, let's pick a word that doesn't put E at the end? Because we know it's not at the end? So any position that is not end? Well, we put E at 3? That's in the middle? So safe.

 Similarly, we put A at position 4? Not at 3? So safe.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""STEAL"".

 But let me double-check: STEAL? 
   S, T, E, A, L -> letters: S, T, E, A, L -> excludes C, R, N? Yes.

 So I'll use STEAL.

<guess>steal</guess>

</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not present, R not present, A present but not at position 3, N not present, E present but not at position 5), the new guess should:
- Include A and E (confirmed present)
- Avoid C, R, N (confirmed absent)
- Place A in a new position (not 3) and E in a new position (not 5) to test different locations
- Incorporate common unverified letters like S, T, and L to maximize information

""STEAL"" meets these criteria:
- S, T, E, A, L avoids C/R/N
- Places A at position 4 (new)
- Places E at position 3 (new)
- Tests high-frequency consonants S, T, and L
- Valid 5-letter English word

<guess>steal</guess>",steal,"We are given the first guess: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
 This means:
   C: not in the word (x)
   R: not in the word (x)
   A: in the word but wrong position (-)
   N: in the word? Actually, it says (x) so N is not in the word? But wait, let me read carefully: N(x) -> not in the word.
   E: in the word but wrong position (-)

 Correction: The feedback says:
   C: x (not in the word)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: - (in the word, but not in the correct position)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: - (in the word, but not in the correct position)

 So we know:
   Letters in the word: A and E (but not in the positions they were in ""crane"").
   Letters not in the word: C, R, N.

 Positions in the word (from ""crane""):
   Position 1: C -> not in word -> so the word does not start with C.
   Position 2: R -> not in word -> so the second letter isn't R.
   Position 3: A -> is in the word, but not at position 3. So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? Wait, but note: we have 5 positions.
   Position 4: N -> not in word -> so the fourth letter isn't N.
   Position 5: E -> is in the word, but not at position 5. So E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.

 Since we know A and E are in the word, we should try a word that includes A and E (and excludes C, R, N) and places them in different positions.

 Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Possible strategy: choose a word that has A and E in positions that are not 3 and 5 (since we know in ""crane"" they were wrong there) and also include other common letters.

 Since position 3 was A and that was wrong, and position 5 was E and that was wrong, we can try placing A and E elsewhere.

 We must avoid using C, R, N.

 Consider: 
   A cannot be at position 3? Actually, it can be elsewhere. But note, the ""-"" means it is in the word but not at that position. So A could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But wait, we have:
   Position 1: cannot be C (we know) and also note that A might be there? But we don't know yet.

 However, note that the word has 5 letters and we know two of them: A and E. And we have three unknown letters.

 We should choose a word that:

However, the feedback for ""crane"" doesn't indicate duplicates. Since A and E were marked as present only once, and in the wrong positions, we assume that at least one A and one E are present. But there could be duplicates? We don't know. But for the next guess, let's assume no duplicates to maximize coverage.

 Also, we want to test other vowels or common consonants.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, P, etc.

 Let me think of words that have A and E, and don't have C, R, N.

 Example: ""LATER"", ""SLATE"", ""LEAST"", etc.

 However, note:
   In ""crane"", the A was at position 3 and E at position 5. So we must move them.

 How about a word where A is at position 1? Then E cannot be at position 5? But E can be anywhere except 5? Actually, we know for the first guess that E was at position 5 and was wrong. That does not prevent E from being at position 5 in the actual word? Wait, no: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, E cannot be at position 5. Similarly, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position, so A cannot be at position 3.

 Therefore:
   Positions where A can be: 1, 2, 4
   Positions where E can be: 1, 2, 3, 4

 Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.

 Let me pick a word that uses common letters and places A and E in new positions.

 Consider ""SLATE"":
   S at position 1, L at 2, A at 3? Wait, but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because the feedback for the first guess said A was at position 3 and was wrong? Actually, no: the first guess had A at position 3 and we were told it's not there. So in ""SLATE"", putting A at position 3 is the same position? That would still be wrong? But we want to test A at a new position.

 Alternatively, ""LEAST"":
   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 for A? Not allowed? Actually, we can try A at a new position? But we know that A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 again, and the word has A, it would still be marked as ""-"" because it's at the same wrong position? Then we won't get new information? Better to move it.

 So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

 How about ""PLATE"":
   P at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Again position 3? Let me avoid.

 How about ""TALES"":
   T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> this puts A at 2 (which is different from 3) and E at 4 (different from 5). Also, avoids positions that we know are incorrect.

 Also, note: in ""crane"", position 1: C (not in word) -> so we can replace C with T or S, etc.

 Let me write the word: TALES
 But does it use any forbidden letters? C, R, N -> no. So it's okay.

 How about ""STALE""?
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 -> we don't want that if we can avoid.

 How about ""STEAL""?
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> this puts E at position 3 and A at position 4 (both new positions). And E is not at 5? And A not at 3? Actually, E at 3? We don't know if position 3 is available for E? We know E is not at 5, but it can be at 3? Yes, because we've never tested it at 3? Actually, we tested E at position 5 and it was wrong, but not at 3? So that's new.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses A at position 1 and E at position 2? For example, ""ADIEU""? But ADIEU has D and I, and also E is at position 4? Actually:
   ""ADIEU"": A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5 -> and E is at 4? But we also noted we haven't tested U? It's a vowel but not super common.

 However, ""STEAL"" seems better because it uses more common letters? But note that we have to avoid R, C, N. And we include S, T, E, A, L.

 Also, ""STEAL"" might help us if we get feedback on S, T, L.

 Another candidate: ""SLATE"" with A at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we shouldn't put it at 3 again? Because then we already know that if A is in the word, it's not at 3. Therefore, putting it at 3 again would still be wrong? And we don't learn anything? Actually, we might: if we put A at 3 again and we get a ""-"", that tells us that indeed it's in the word? Wait, we already know that. So we don't get new information on the position.

 Hence, we should try A at a position we haven't tested. Similarly for E.

 So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

 How about ""STALE""? That has A at 3 -> avoid.
 How about ""SLATE"" with A at 3 -> avoid.

 Alternatively, ""LEAFS"" (if valid): L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again position 3? Avoid.

 How about ""ADIEU""? 
   A: position 1 -> new position for A (since only tested at 3 before) -> good.
   E: position 4 -> new position (since tested only at 5) -> good.
   Also, we get to test D, I, U.

 However, U is less common? And we might want more common letters.

 How about ""PASTE""?
   P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but we know E cannot be at 5? So if we put E at 5, and the word has E, then we expect a ""-"" for E? But that's the same as before? So we don't learn if E can be at 5? Actually, we know already that E is not at 5? Then it must be elsewhere? Therefore, putting E at 5 again is futile? Because we already know it's not there? And we get a ""-"" if E is in the word? But that doesn't tell us where it might be? So we waste that slot.

 Therefore, we want E at a position that is not 5? And A at a position that is not 3? So ""PASTE"" has A at 2? That's a new position? But E at 5? We should avoid.

 How about ""STEAK"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, K at 5 -> this avoids A at 3? And E not at 5? Actually E is at 3? A at 4? Both new positions? And K is a common consonant.

 But note: we must avoid letters C, R, N -> and ""STEAK"" does not have them.

 So yes.

 Alternatively, ""STEAM"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, M at 5 -> same issue? E at 3? Then we might get new information? And we test M at 5? But M hasn't been tested? And E at position 3 is new? Because first guess we only had E at 5? So we don't know about position 3? Correct.

 However, note that the word does not have R, C, N? Both STEAM and STEAK are acceptable.

 But STEAM has M? We haven't tested M? So we can learn something.

 How about ""PLANE""? But it has N? Which we know is not in the word? But wait: first feedback says N is not in the word? So we shouldn't use N.

 Therefore, we must avoid N? So ""PLANE"" is invalid.

 Let me decide: I think ""TALES"" is a good candidate? 
   T at 1? We haven't tested position 1? 
   A at 2? New? 
   L at 3? 
   E at 4? New? 
   S at 5?

 But note: in the feedback, we don't know anything about position 1? Only that C was there and is wrong? So we can put T there? And since T is a common starting letter.

 Also, ""TALES"" contains:
   T: not tested before? 
   A: present, at position 2? 
   L: not tested? 
   E: present, at position 4? 
   S: not tested?

 We avoid C, R, N? Yes.

 But what if we get: A at position 2? What if the actual A is not at 2? Then we get ""A"" as ""-""? But we already know A is present? Then we know it's not at 2? Similarly for E? Then we get information? Actually, we would know that A is not at 2? And E not at 4? Then we can narrow down.

 Alternatively, we can maximize coverage: we have A and E to be placed in positions that are new? And three new letters: T, L, S.

 Also, we can consider: if the word has A at position 1, then we are not testing that? So maybe we can try including position 1? But we have T at 1? So if we get a ✓ on T? Then we know? Or if we get a ""-""? Then we know T is in the word? Etc.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but move A? We can't? Because we can't control? Or can we? We have to choose a word? How about ""SALET"" (if valid)? 
   S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> similar to TALES? And A at 2, E at 4.

 But SALET is a word? Yes, it's an old term for a helmet? But accepted in Wordle? Depends? But I think it is.

 However, TALES is more common.

 Another word: ""TEALS"" — teal is a color, plural? TEALS? Might not be accepted? So stick to TALES?

 But let me confirm: TALES is valid.

 So I'll go with ""TALES"".

 However, note: we have two words: TALES and STEAL? Which one? 
   STEAL: S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5? Then A is at 4? And E at 3? Both new? So why not STEAL?

 Actually, STEAL is a very common word. Also, S, T, E, A, L — same letters? Just arranged differently.

 But in STEAL: S at 1, T at 2? Which we haven't tested? And E at 3 (new position), A at 4 (new), L at 5? 
 We also avoid C, R, N? Yes.

 The advantage of STEAL: 
   Position 1: we test S? Which is a very common letter? And T next? 
   And A we get to put at 4? And E at 3? 

 But note: we already know A is present? So if we put A at 4? And if it's the correct location? We get a ✓? Or if it's not? Then we know it's elsewhere? Similarly for E? 

 Also, we get to test L at position 5? Which hasn't been tested? 

 How about compared to TALES? 
   TALES: position 1 is T? Then A at 2? Then E at 4? L at 3? S at 5? 

 Both arrangements are good? 

 But in the first guess, we tested letter E at position 5? And got ""-""? So if we put L at position 5? How do we know? We don't? But we'll test it? 

 Alternatively: the word has exactly 5 letters? And we know two: A and E? So three unknown? 

 Both STEAL and TALES test three new letters? So same? 

 How about frequency? 
   S is very common? T too? L less than S? So STEAL might be better because S is at the beginning? 

 But note: in the first guess, we didn't have S or T? So we are testing high-frequency letters? 

 However, STEAL has S and T at positions 1 and 2? Both common? 

 Also, STEAL the word is standard? 

 I'll choose STEAL? But wait: in STEAL, E is at position 3? We don't know? But in the actual word? We don't know? So it's good.

 But note: we must be able to interpret? 

 Alternatively, let's pick a word that doesn't put E at the end? Because we know it's not at the end? So any position that is not end? Well, we put E at 3? That's in the middle? So safe.

 Similarly, we put A at position 4? Not at 3? So safe.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""STEAL"".

 But let me double-check: STEAL? 
   S, T, E, A, L -> letters: S, T, E, A, L -> excludes C, R, N? Yes.

 So I'll use STEAL.

<guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not present, R not present, A present but not at position 3, N not present, E present but not at position 5), the new guess should:
- Include A and E (confirmed present)
- Avoid C, R, N (confirmed absent)
- Place A in a new position (not 3) and E in a new position (not 5) to test different locations
- Incorporate common unverified letters like S, T, and L to maximize information

""STEAL"" meets these criteria:
- S, T, E, A, L avoids C/R/N
- Places A at position 4 (new)
- Places E at position 3 (new)
- Tests high-frequency consonants S, T, and L
- Valid 5-letter English word",Guess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,steak,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the first guess: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
 This means:
   C: not in the word (x)
   R: not in the word (x)
   A: in the word but wrong position (-)
   N: in the word? Actually, it says (x) so N is not in the word? But wait, let me read carefully: N(x) -> not in the word.
   E: in the word but wrong position (-)

 Correction: The feedback says:
   C: x (not in the word)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: - (in the word, but not in the correct position)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: - (in the word, but not in the correct position)

 So we know:
   Letters in the word: A and E (but not in the positions they were in ""crane"").
   Letters not in the word: C, R, N.

 Positions in the word (from ""crane""):
   Position 1: C -> not in word -> so the word does not start with C.
   Position 2: R -> not in word -> so the second letter isn't R.
   Position 3: A -> is in the word, but not at position 3. So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? Wait, but note: we have 5 positions.
   Position 4: N -> not in word -> so the fourth letter isn't N.
   Position 5: E -> is in the word, but not at position 5. So E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.

 Since we know A and E are in the word, we should try a word that includes A and E (and excludes C, R, N) and places them in different positions.

 Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Possible strategy: choose a word that has A and E in positions that are not 3 and 5 (since we know in ""crane"" they were wrong there) and also include other common letters.

 Since position 3 was A and that was wrong, and position 5 was E and that was wrong, we can try placing A and E elsewhere.

 We must avoid using C, R, N.

 Consider: 
   A cannot be at position 3? Actually, it can be elsewhere. But note, the ""-"" means it is in the word but not at that position. So A could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But wait, we have:
   Position 1: cannot be C (we know) and also note that A might be there? But we don't know yet.

 However, note that the word has 5 letters and we know two of them: A and E. And we have three unknown letters.

 We should choose a word that:
   - Includes A and E (but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively? Not necessarily, because if the word has duplicate letters then it might be, but we don't know. However, the feedback for ""crane"" doesn't indicate duplicates. Since A and E were marked as present only once, and in the wrong positions, we assume that at least one A and one E are present. But there could be duplicates? We don't know. But for the next guess, let's assume no duplicates to maximize coverage.

 Also, we want to test other vowels or common consonants.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, P, etc.

 Let me think of words that have A and E, and don't have C, R, N.

 Example: ""LATER"", ""SLATE"", ""LEAST"", etc.

 However, note:
   In ""crane"", the A was at position 3 and E at position 5. So we must move them.

 How about a word where A is at position 1? Then E cannot be at position 5? But E can be anywhere except 5? Actually, we know for the first guess that E was at position 5 and was wrong. That does not prevent E from being at position 5 in the actual word? Wait, no: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, E cannot be at position 5. Similarly, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position, so A cannot be at position 3.

 Therefore:
   Positions where A can be: 1, 2, 4
   Positions where E can be: 1, 2, 3, 4

 Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.

 Let me pick a word that uses common letters and places A and E in new positions.

 Consider ""SLATE"":
   S at position 1, L at 2, A at 3? Wait, but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because the feedback for the first guess said A was at position 3 and was wrong? Actually, no: the first guess had A at position 3 and we were told it's not there. So in ""SLATE"", putting A at position 3 is the same position? That would still be wrong? But we want to test A at a new position.

 Alternatively, ""LEAST"":
   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 for A? Not allowed? Actually, we can try A at a new position? But we know that A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 again, and the word has A, it would still be marked as ""-"" because it's at the same wrong position? Then we won't get new information? Better to move it.

 So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

 How about ""PLATE"":
   P at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Again position 3? Let me avoid.

 How about ""TALES"":
   T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> this puts A at 2 (which is different from 3) and E at 4 (different from 5). Also, avoids positions that we know are incorrect.

 Also, note: in ""crane"", position 1: C (not in word) -> so we can replace C with T or S, etc.

 Let me write the word: TALES
 But does it use any forbidden letters? C, R, N -> no. So it's okay.

 How about ""STALE""?
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 -> we don't want that if we can avoid.

 How about ""STEAL""?
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> this puts E at position 3 and A at position 4 (both new positions). And E is not at 5? And A not at 3? Actually, E at 3? We don't know if position 3 is available for E? We know E is not at 5, but it can be at 3? Yes, because we've never tested it at 3? Actually, we tested E at position 5 and it was wrong, but not at 3? So that's new.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses A at position 1 and E at position 2? For example, ""ADIEU""? But ADIEU has D and I, and also E is at position 4? Actually:
   ""ADIEU"": A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5 -> and E is at 4? But we also noted we haven't tested U? It's a vowel but not super common.

 However, ""STEAL"" seems better because it uses more common letters? But note that we have to avoid R, C, N. And we include S, T, E, A, L.

 Also, ""STEAL"" might help us if we get feedback on S, T, L.

 Another candidate: ""SLATE"" with A at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we shouldn't put it at 3 again? Because then we already know that if A is in the word, it's not at 3. Therefore, putting it at 3 again would still be wrong? And we don't learn anything? Actually, we might: if we put A at 3 again and we get a ""-"", that tells us that indeed it's in the word? Wait, we already know that. So we don't get new information on the position.

 Hence, we should try A at a position we haven't tested. Similarly for E.

 So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

 How about ""STALE""? That has A at 3 -> avoid.
 How about ""SLATE"" with A at 3 -> avoid.

 Alternatively, ""LEAFS"" (if valid): L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again position 3? Avoid.

 How about ""ADIEU""? 
   A: position 1 -> new position for A (since only tested at 3 before) -> good.
   E: position 4 -> new position (since tested only at 5) -> good.
   Also, we get to test D, I, U.

 However, U is less common? And we might want more common letters.

 How about ""PASTE""?
   P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but we know E cannot be at 5? So if we put E at 5, and the word has E, then we expect a ""-"" for E? But that's the same as before? So we don't learn if E can be at 5? Actually, we know already that E is not at 5? Then it must be elsewhere? Therefore, putting E at 5 again is futile? Because we already know it's not there? And we get a ""-"" if E is in the word? But that doesn't tell us where it might be? So we waste that slot.

 Therefore, we want E at a position that is not 5? And A at a position that is not 3? So ""PASTE"" has A at 2? That's a new position? But E at 5? We should avoid.

 How about ""STEAK"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, K at 5 -> this avoids A at 3? And E not at 5? Actually E is at 3? A at 4? Both new positions? And K is a common consonant.

 But note: we must avoid letters C, R, N -> and ""STEAK"" does not have them.

 So yes.

 Alternatively, ""STEAM"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, M at 5 -> same issue? E at 3? Then we might get new information? And we test M at 5? But M hasn't been tested? And E at position 3 is new? Because first guess we only had E at 5? So we don't know about position 3? Correct.

 However, note that the word does not have R, C, N? Both STEAM and STEAK are acceptable.

 But STEAM has M? We haven't tested M? So we can learn something.

 How about ""PLANE""? But it has N? Which we know is not in the word? But wait: first feedback says N is not in the word? So we shouldn't use N.

 Therefore, we must avoid N? So ""PLANE"" is invalid.

 Let me decide: I think ""TALES"" is a good candidate? 
   T at 1? We haven't tested position 1? 
   A at 2? New? 
   L at 3? 
   E at 4? New? 
   S at 5?

 But note: in the feedback, we don't know anything about position 1? Only that C was there and is wrong? So we can put T there? And since T is a common starting letter.

 Also, ""TALES"" contains:
   T: not tested before? 
   A: present, at position 2? 
   L: not tested? 
   E: present, at position 4? 
   S: not tested?

 We avoid C, R, N? Yes.

 But what if we get: A at position 2? What if the actual A is not at 2? Then we get ""A"" as ""-""? But we already know A is present? Then we know it's not at 2? Similarly for E? Then we get information? Actually, we would know that A is not at 2? And E not at 4? Then we can narrow down.

 Alternatively, we can maximize coverage: we have A and E to be placed in positions that are new? And three new letters: T, L, S.

 Also, we can consider: if the word has A at position 1, then we are not testing that? So maybe we can try including position 1? But we have T at 1? So if we get a ✓ on T? Then we know? Or if we get a ""-""? Then we know T is in the word? Etc.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but move A? We can't? Because we can't control? Or can we? We have to choose a word? How about ""SALET"" (if valid)? 
   S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> similar to TALES? And A at 2, E at 4.

 But SALET is a word? Yes, it's an old term for a helmet? But accepted in Wordle? Depends? But I think it is.

 However, TALES is more common.

 Another word: ""TEALS"" — teal is a color, plural? TEALS? Might not be accepted? So stick to TALES?

 But let me confirm: TALES is valid.

 So I'll go with ""TALES"".

 However, note: we have two words: TALES and STEAL? Which one? 
   STEAL: S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5? Then A is at 4? And E at 3? Both new? So why not STEAL?

 Actually, STEAL is a very common word. Also, S, T, E, A, L — same letters? Just arranged differently.

 But in STEAL: S at 1, T at 2? Which we haven't tested? And E at 3 (new position), A at 4 (new), L at 5? 
 We also avoid C, R, N? Yes.

 The advantage of STEAL: 
   Position 1: we test S? Which is a very common letter? And T next? 
   And A we get to put at 4? And E at 3? 

 But note: we already know A is present? So if we put A at 4? And if it's the correct location? We get a ✓? Or if it's not? Then we know it's elsewhere? Similarly for E? 

 Also, we get to test L at position 5? Which hasn't been tested? 

 How about compared to TALES? 
   TALES: position 1 is T? Then A at 2? Then E at 4? L at 3? S at 5? 

 Both arrangements are good? 

 But in the first guess, we tested letter E at position 5? And got ""-""? So if we put L at position 5? How do we know? We don't? But we'll test it? 

 Alternatively: the word has exactly 5 letters? And we know two: A and E? So three unknown? 

 Both STEAL and TALES test three new letters? So same? 

 How about frequency? 
   S is very common? T too? L less than S? So STEAL might be better because S is at the beginning? 

 But note: in the first guess, we didn't have S or T? So we are testing high-frequency letters? 

 However, STEAL has S and T at positions 1 and 2? Both common? 

 Also, STEAL the word is standard? 

 I'll choose STEAL? But wait: in STEAL, E is at position 3? We don't know? But in the actual word? We don't know? So it's good.

 But note: we must be able to interpret? 

 Alternatively, let's pick a word that doesn't put E at the end? Because we know it's not at the end? So any position that is not end? Well, we put E at 3? That's in the middle? So safe.

 Similarly, we put A at position 4? Not at 3? So safe.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""STEAL"".

 But let me double-check: STEAL? 
   S, T, E, A, L -> letters: S, T, E, A, L -> excludes C, R, N? Yes.

 So I'll use STEAL.

<guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not present, R not present, A present but not at position 3, N not present, E present but not at position 5), the new guess should:
- Include A and E (confirmed present)
- Avoid C, R, N (confirmed absent)
- Place A in a new position (not 3) and E in a new position (not 5) to test different locations
- Incorporate common unverified letters like S, T, and L to maximize information

""STEAL"" meets these criteria:
- S, T, E, A, L avoids C/R/N
- Places A at position 4 (new)
- Places E at position 3 (new)
- Tests high-frequency consonants S, T, and L
- Valid 5-letter English word

So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? Wait, but note: we have 5 positions.\n   Position 4: N -> not in word -> so the fourth letter isn\'t N.\n   Position 5: E -> is in the word, but not at position 5. So E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.\n\n Since we know A and E are in the word, we should try a word that includes A and E (and excludes C, R, N) and places them in different positions.\n\n Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\n Possible strategy: choose a word that has A and E in positions that are not 3 and 5 (since we know in ""crane"" they were wrong there) and also include other common letters.\n\n Since position 3 was A and that was wrong, and position 5 was E and that was wrong, we can try placing A and E elsewhere.\n\n We must avoid using C, R, N.\n\n Consider: \n   A cannot be at position 3? Actually, it can be elsewhere. But note, the ""-"" means it is in the word but not at that position. So A could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But wait, we have:\n   Position 1: cannot be C (we know) and also note that A might be there? But we don\'t know yet.\n\n However, note that the word has 5 letters and we know two of them: A and E. And we have three unknown letters.\n\n We should choose a word that:\n   - Includes A and E (but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively? Not necessarily, because if the word has duplicate letters then it might be, but we don\'t know. However, the feedback for ""crane"" doesn\'t indicate duplicates. Since A and E were marked as present only once, and in the wrong positions, we assume that at least one A and one E are present. But there could be duplicates? We don\'t know. But for the next guess, let\'s assume no duplicates to maximize coverage.\n\n Also, we want to test other vowels or common consonants.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, P, etc.\n\n Let me think of words that have A and E, and don\'t have C, R, N.\n\n Example: ""LATER"", ""SLATE"", ""LEAST"", etc.\n\n However, note:\n   In ""crane"", the A was at position 3 and E at position 5. So we must move them.\n\n How about a word where A is at position 1? Then E cannot be at position 5? But E can be anywhere except 5? Actually, we know for the first guess that E was at position 5 and was wrong. That does not prevent E from being at position 5 in the actual word? Wait, no: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, E cannot be at position 5. Similarly, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position, so A cannot be at position 3.\n\n Therefore:\n   Positions where A can be: 1, 2, 4\n   Positions where E can be: 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.\n\n Let me pick a word that uses common letters and places A and E in new positions.\n\n Consider ""SLATE"":\n   S at position 1, L at 2, A at 3? Wait, but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because the feedback for the first guess said A was at position 3 and was wrong? Actually, no: the first guess had A at position 3 and we were told it\'s not there. So in ""SLATE"", putting A at position 3 is the same position? That would still be wrong? But we want to test A at a new position.\n\n Alternatively, ""LEAST"":\n   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 for A? Not allowed? Actually, we can try A at a new position? But we know that A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 again, and the word has A, it would still be marked as ""-"" because it\'s at the same wrong position? Then we won\'t get new information? Better to move it.\n\n So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.\n\n How about ""PLATE"":\n   P at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Again position 3? Let me avoid.\n\n How about ""TALES"":\n   T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> this puts A at 2 (which is different from 3) and E at 4 (different from 5). Also, avoids positions that we know are incorrect.\n\n Also, note: in ""crane"", position 1: C (not in word) -> so we can replace C with T or S, etc.\n\n Let me write the word: TALES\n But does it use any forbidden letters? C, R, N -> no. So it\'s okay.\n\n How about ""STALE""?\n   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 -> we don\'t want that if we can avoid.\n\n How about ""STEAL""?\n   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> this puts E at position 3 and A at position 4 (both new positions). And E is not at 5? And A not at 3? Actually, E at 3? We don\'t know if position 3 is available for E? We know E is not at 5, but it can be at 3? Yes, because we\'ve never tested it at 3? Actually, we tested E at position 5 and it was wrong, but not at 3? So that\'s new.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses A at position 1 and E at position 2? For example, ""ADIEU""? But ADIEU has D and I, and also E is at position 4? Actually:\n   ""ADIEU"": A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5 -> and E is at 4? But we also noted we haven\'t tested U? It\'s a vowel but not super common.\n\n However, ""STEAL"" seems better because it uses more common letters? But note that we have to avoid R, C, N. And we include S, T, E, A, L.\n\n Also, ""STEAL"" might help us if we get feedback on S, T, L.\n\n Another candidate: ""SLATE"" with A at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we shouldn\'t put it at 3 again? Because then we already know that if A is in the word, it\'s not at 3. Therefore, putting it at 3 again would still be wrong? And we don\'t learn anything? Actually, we might: if we put A at 3 again and we get a ""-"", that tells us that indeed it\'s in the word? Wait, we already know that. So we don\'t get new information on the position.\n\n Hence, we should try A at a position we haven\'t tested. Similarly for E.\n\n So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.\n\n How about ""STALE""? That has A at 3 -> avoid.\n How about ""SLATE"" with A at 3 -> avoid.\n\n Alternatively, ""LEAFS"" (if valid): L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again position 3? Avoid.\n\n How about ""ADIEU""? \n   A: position 1 -> new position for A (since only tested at 3 before) -> good.\n   E: position 4 -> new position (since tested only at 5) -> good.\n   Also, we get to test D, I, U.\n\n However, U is less common? And we might want more common letters.\n\n How about ""PASTE""?\n   P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but we know E cannot be at 5? So if we put E at 5, and the word has E, then we expect a ""-"" for E? But that\'s the same as before? So we don\'t learn if E can be at 5? Actually, we know already that E is not at 5? Then it must be elsewhere? Therefore, putting E at 5 again is futile? Because we already know it\'s not there? And we get a ""-"" if E is in the word? But that doesn\'t tell us where it might be? So we waste that slot.\n\n Therefore, we want E at a position that is not 5? And A at a position that is not 3? So ""PASTE"" has A at 2? That\'s a new position? But E at 5? We should avoid.\n\n How about ""STEAK"": \n   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, K at 5 -> this avoids A at 3? And E not at 5? Actually E is at 3? A at 4? Both new positions? And K is a common consonant.\n\n But note: we must avoid letters C, R, N -> and ""STEAK"" does not have them.\n\n So yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""STEAM"": \n   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, M at 5 -> same issue? E at 3? Then we might get new information? And we test M at 5? But M hasn\'t been tested? And E at position 3 is new? Because first guess we only had E at 5? So we don\'t know about position 3? Correct.\n\n However, note that the word does not have R, C, N? Both STEAM and STEAK are acceptable.\n\n But STEAM has M? We haven\'t tested M? So we can learn something.\n\n How about ""PLANE""? But it has N? Which we know is not in the word? But wait: first feedback says N is not in the word? So we shouldn\'t use N.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid N? So ""PLANE"" is invalid.\n\n Let me decide: I think ""TALES"" is a good candidate? \n   T at 1? We haven\'t tested position 1? \n   A at 2? New? \n   L at 3? \n   E at 4? New? \n   S at 5?\n\n But note: in the feedback, we don\'t know anything about position 1? Only that C was there and is wrong? So we can put T there? And since T is a common starting letter.\n\n Also, ""TALES"" contains:\n   T: not tested before? \n   A: present, at position 2? \n   L: not tested? \n   E: present, at position 4? \n   S: not tested?\n\n We avoid C, R, N? Yes.\n\n But what if we get: A at position 2? What if the actual A is not at 2? Then we get ""A"" as ""-""? But we already know A is present? Then we know it\'s not at 2? Similarly for E? Then we get information? Actually, we would know that A is not at 2? And E not at 4? Then we can narrow down.\n\n Alternatively, we can maximize coverage: we have A and E to be placed in positions that are new? And three new letters: T, L, S.\n\n Also, we can consider: if the word has A at position 1, then we are not testing that? So maybe we can try including position 1? But we have T at 1? So if we get a ✓ on T? Then we know? Or if we get a ""-""? Then we know T is in the word? Etc.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but move A? We can\'t? Because we can\'t control? Or can we? We have to choose a word? How about ""SALET"" (if valid)? \n   S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> similar to TALES? And A at 2, E at 4.\n\n But SALET is a word? Yes, it\'s an old term for a helmet? But accepted in Wordle? Depends? But I think it is.\n\n However, TALES is more common.\n\n Another word: ""TEALS"" — teal is a color, plural? TEALS? Might not be accepted? So stick to TALES?\n\n But let me confirm: TALES is valid.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""TALES"".\n\n However, note: we have two words: TALES and STEAL? Which one? \n   STEAL: S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5? Then A is at 4? And E at 3? Both new? So why not STEAL?\n\n Actually, STEAL is a very common word. Also, S, T, E, A, L — same letters? Just arranged differently.\n\n But in STEAL: S at 1, T at 2? Which we haven\'t tested? And E at 3 (new position), A at 4 (new), L at 5? \n We also avoid C, R, N? Yes.\n\n The advantage of STEAL: \n   Position 1: we test S? Which is a very common letter? And T next? \n   And A we get to put at 4? And E at 3? \n\n But note: we already know A is present? So if we put A at 4? And if it\'s the correct location? We get a ✓? Or if it\'s not? Then we know it\'s elsewhere? Similarly for E? \n\n Also, we get to test L at position 5? Which hasn\'t been tested? \n\n How about compared to TALES? \n   TALES: position 1 is T? Then A at 2? Then E at 4? L at 3? S at 5? \n\n Both arrangements are good? \n\n But in the first guess, we tested letter E at position 5? And got ""-""? So if we put L at position 5? How do we know? We don\'t? But we\'ll test it? \n\n Alternatively: the word has exactly 5 letters? And we know two: A and E? So three unknown? \n\n Both STEAL and TALES test three new letters? So same? \n\n How about frequency? \n   S is very common? T too? L less than S? So STEAL might be better because S is at the beginning? \n\n But note: in the first guess, we didn\'t have S or T? So we are testing high-frequency letters? \n\n However, STEAL has S and T at positions 1 and 2? Both common? \n\n Also, STEAL the word is standard? \n\n I\'ll choose STEAL? But wait: in STEAL, E is at position 3? We don\'t know? But in the actual word? We don\'t know? So it\'s good.\n\n But note: we must be able to interpret? \n\n Alternatively, let\'s pick a word that doesn\'t put E at the end? Because we know it\'s not at the end? So any position that is not end? Well, we put E at 3? That\'s in the middle? So safe.\n\n Similarly, we put A at position 4? Not at 3? So safe.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""STEAL"".\n\n But let me double-check: STEAL? \n   S, T, E, A, L -> letters: S, T, E, A, L -> excludes C, R, N? Yes.\n\n So I\'ll use STEAL.\n\n<guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not present, R not present, A present but not at position 3, N not present, E present but not at position 5), the new guess should:\n- Include A and E (confirmed present)\n- Avoid C, R, N (confirmed absent)\n- Place A in a new position (not 3) and E in a new position (not 5) to test different locations\n- Incorporate common unverified letters like S, T, and L to maximize information\n\n""STEAL"" meets these criteria:\n- S, T, E, A, L avoids C/R/N\n- Places A at position 4 (new)\n- Places E at position 3 (new)\n- Tests high-frequency consonants S, T, and L\n- Valid 5-letter English word\n\n<guess>steal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
  - C, R, N are not in the word.
  - A is in the word but not at position 3.
  - E is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""steal"" -> S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
Meaning:
  - S is in the word and at the correct position (position 1).
  - T is in the word and at the correct position (position 2).
  - E is in the word and at the correct position (position 3).
  - A is in the word and at the correct position (position 4).
  - L is not in the word.

So, from the second guess, we know:
  - The word starts with ""S"" and the second letter is ""T"", the third is ""E"", and the fourth is ""A"". 
  - The word is S T E A _ 
  - The last letter is missing, and we know it's not L (and also not C, R, N from the first guess).

Additionally, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, N, L.

We also know from the first guess that E is not at position 5 (but now we have it at position 3, which is correct) and A is not at position 3 (now at position 4, which is correct). So that is consistent.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""STEA"" and the last letter is not C, R, N, L.

What are the possible last letters? We need to consider common English letters that are not in the exclusion list.

Exclusion list: C, R, N, L.

Possible letters for the last position: any letter except C, R, N, L, and also we must consider that the word must be valid.

Common words that start with ""STEA"":
- STEAD
- STEAK
- STEAL (but we tried and L is not in the word, so not this)
- STEAM
- STEAR (but R is excluded, so not)
- STEAN? (not a word, and N is excluded)

So the common ones are: STEAD, STEAK, STEAM.

We already know that L is not in the word, so STEAL is out.

Now, we have to choose one. We can try one of these.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to get it in one shot? But we don't know which one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we already have 4 letters fixed: S, T, E, A. So we only need to find the last letter.

But we don't have a word that tests multiple last letters? Because we can only test one word.

So we have to guess one of the possibilities.

Let's list the possibilities again:

- STEAD: D at the end
- STEAK: K at the end
- STEAM: M at the end
- STEA? any others? 
  - STEA? STEAN? not a word.
  - STEAR? not allowed because R is excluded.
  - STEAX? not a word.
  - STEAB? not a word.

So only STEAD, STEAK, STEAM.

We can try one of these. How to choose? We can consider frequency.

In English, ""STEAM"" is very common, as is ""STEAK"". ""STEAD"" is less common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can look at the feedback: we have no information about D, K, M? So we have to guess.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to guess one and if wrong, then the next.

But we can also think: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was wrong? But now we have E at position 3? So that doesn't help.

Another idea: we can use a word that has the same structure? But we don't have to, because we have 4 letters fixed.

So I think we should just pick one. Let's pick ""STEAM"" because it's common.

But wait: we have to make sure that M is not excluded? We haven't tested M? And it's not in the exclusion list? So it's possible.

Similarly, D and K are not excluded.

So I'll go with ""STEAM"".

But note: the feedback for the second guess said L is not in the word? So we avoid L? And we are avoiding C, R, N? So STEAM is safe.

Therefore, the next guess is ""STEAM"".

But let me confirm: 
  Position 1: S (correct) -> we know it's S
  Position 2: T (correct) -> we know it's T
  Position 3: E (correct) -> we know it's E
  Position 4: A (correct) -> we know it's A
  Position 5: M (to be tested)

If it's correct, we win. If not, then we know it's either D or K? Then we can try STEAD or STEAK next.

But we are on the third guess? So we have three more guesses? So it's safe.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use the known positions? But that would be inefficient? Because we already have 4 letters fixed? Why not use that?

So I think ""STEAM"" is a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""STEAM"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 or 5. C, R, and N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (steal)**: S, T, E, and A are correct and in the exact positions (positions 1, 2, 3, and 4). L is absent.

This means:
- The word starts with **STEA** (positions 1–4 are S, T, E, A).
- The last letter (position 5) is missing and must be a letter not yet excluded (excluded: C, R, N, L).
- Possible words: **STEAD** (D), **STEAK** (K), or **STEAM** (M).

To solve the word, I'll guess **STEAM** to test if M is the final letter. If incorrect, the solution must be STEAD or STEAK.

<guess>steam</guess>",steam,"We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
  - C, R, N are not in the word.
  - A is in the word but not at position 3.
  - E is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""steal"" -> S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
Meaning:
  - S is in the word and at the correct position (position 1).
  - T is in the word and at the correct position (position 2).
  - E is in the word and at the correct position (position 3).
  - A is in the word and at the correct position (position 4).
  - L is not in the word.

So, from the second guess, we know:
  - The word starts with ""S"" and the second letter is ""T"", the third is ""E"", and the fourth is ""A"". 
  - The word is S T E A _ 
  - The last letter is missing, and we know it's not L (and also not C, R, N from the first guess).

Additionally, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, N, L.

We also know from the first guess that E is not at position 5 (but now we have it at position 3, which is correct) and A is not at position 3 (now at position 4, which is correct). So that is consistent.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""STEA"" and the last letter is not C, R, N, L.

What are the possible last letters? We need to consider common English letters that are not in the exclusion list.

Exclusion list: C, R, N, L.

Possible letters for the last position: any letter except C, R, N, L, and also we must consider that the word must be valid.

Common words that start with ""STEA"":
- STEAD
- STEAK
- STEAL (but we tried and L is not in the word, so not this)
- STEAM
- STEAR (but R is excluded, so not)
- STEAN? (not a word, and N is excluded)

So the common ones are: STEAD, STEAK, STEAM.

We already know that L is not in the word, so STEAL is out.

Now, we have to choose one. We can try one of these.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to get it in one shot? But we don't know which one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we already have 4 letters fixed: S, T, E, A. So we only need to find the last letter.

But we don't have a word that tests multiple last letters? Because we can only test one word.

So we have to guess one of the possibilities.

Let's list the possibilities again:

- STEAD: D at the end
- STEAK: K at the end
- STEAM: M at the end
- STEA? any others? 
  - STEA? STEAN? not a word.
  - STEAR? not allowed because R is excluded.
  - STEAX? not a word.
  - STEAB? not a word.

So only STEAD, STEAK, STEAM.

We can try one of these. How to choose? We can consider frequency.

In English, ""STEAM"" is very common, as is ""STEAK"". ""STEAD"" is less common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can look at the feedback: we have no information about D, K, M? So we have to guess.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to guess one and if wrong, then the next.

But we can also think: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was wrong? But now we have E at position 3? So that doesn't help.

Another idea: we can use a word that has the same structure? But we don't have to, because we have 4 letters fixed.

So I think we should just pick one. Let's pick ""STEAM"" because it's common.

But wait: we have to make sure that M is not excluded? We haven't tested M? And it's not in the exclusion list? So it's possible.

Similarly, D and K are not excluded.

So I'll go with ""STEAM"".

But note: the feedback for the second guess said L is not in the word? So we avoid L? And we are avoiding C, R, N? So STEAM is safe.

Therefore, the next guess is ""STEAM"".

But let me confirm: 
  Position 1: S (correct) -> we know it's S
  Position 2: T (correct) -> we know it's T
  Position 3: E (correct) -> we know it's E
  Position 4: A (correct) -> we know it's A
  Position 5: M (to be tested)

If it's correct, we win. If not, then we know it's either D or K? Then we can try STEAD or STEAK next.

But we are on the third guess? So we have three more guesses? So it's safe.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use the known positions? But that would be inefficient? Because we already have 4 letters fixed? Why not use that?

So I think ""STEAM"" is a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""STEAM"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 or 5. C, R, and N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (steal)**: S, T, E, and A are correct and in the exact positions (positions 1, 2, 3, and 4). L is absent.

This means:
- The word starts with **STEA** (positions 1–4 are S, T, E, A).
- The last letter (position 5) is missing and must be a letter not yet excluded (excluded: C, R, N, L).
- Possible words: **STEAD** (D), **STEAK** (K), or **STEAM** (M).

To solve the word, I'll guess **STEAM** to test if M is the final letter. If incorrect, the solution must be STEAD or STEAK.",Guess 3: steam -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) M(x),FAIL

- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" as it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the first guess: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
 This means:
   C: not in the word (x)
   R: not in the word (x)
   A: in the word but wrong position (-)
   N: in the word? Actually, it says (x) so N is not in the word? But wait, let me read carefully: N(x) -> not in the word.
   E: in the word but wrong position (-)

 Correction: The feedback says:
   C: x (not in the word)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: - (in the word, but not in the correct position)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: - (in the word, but not in the correct position)

 So we know:
   Letters in the word: A and E (but not in the positions they were in ""crane"").
   Letters not in the word: C, R, N.

 Positions in the word (from ""crane""):
   Position 1: C -> not in word -> so the word does not start with C.
   Position 2: R -> not in word -> so the second letter isn't R.
   Position 3: A -> is in the word, but not at position 3. So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? Wait, but note: we have 5 positions.
   Position 4: N -> not in word -> so the fourth letter isn't N.
   Position 5: E -> is in the word, but not at position 5. So E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.

 Since we know A and E are in the word, we should try a word that includes A and E (and excludes C, R, N) and places them in different positions.

 Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Possible strategy: choose a word that has A and E in positions that are not 3 and 5 (since we know in ""crane"" they were wrong there) and also include other common letters.

 Since position 3 was A and that was wrong, and position 5 was E and that was wrong, we can try placing A and E elsewhere.

 We must avoid using C, R, N.

 Consider: 
   A cannot be at position 3? Actually, it can be elsewhere. But note, the ""-"" means it is in the word but not at that position. So A could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But wait, we have:
   Position 1: cannot be C (we know) and also note that A might be there? But we don't know yet.

 However, note that the word has 5 letters and we know two of them: A and E. And we have three unknown letters.

 We should choose a word that:
   - Includes A and E (but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively? Not necessarily, because if the word has duplicate letters then it might be, but we don't know. However, the feedback for ""crane"" doesn't indicate duplicates. Since A and E were marked as present only once, and in the wrong positions, we assume that at least one A and one E are present. But there could be duplicates? We don't know. But for the next guess, let's assume no duplicates to maximize coverage.

 Also, we want to test other vowels or common consonants.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, P, etc.

 Let me think of words that have A and E, and don't have C, R, N.

 Example: ""LATER"", ""SLATE"", ""LEAST"", etc.

 However, note:
   In ""crane"", the A was at position 3 and E at position 5. So we must move them.

 How about a word where A is at position 1? Then E cannot be at position 5? But E can be anywhere except 5? Actually, we know for the first guess that E was at position 5 and was wrong. That does not prevent E from being at position 5 in the actual word? Wait, no: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, E cannot be at position 5. Similarly, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position, so A cannot be at position 3.

 Therefore:
   Positions where A can be: 1, 2, 4
   Positions where E can be: 1, 2, 3, 4

 Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.

 Let me pick a word that uses common letters and places A and E in new positions.

 Consider ""SLATE"":
   S at position 1, L at 2, A at 3? Wait, but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because the feedback for the first guess said A was at position 3 and was wrong? Actually, no: the first guess had A at position 3 and we were told it's not there. So in ""SLATE"", putting A at position 3 is the same position? That would still be wrong? But we want to test A at a new position.

 Alternatively, ""LEAST"":
   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 for A? Not allowed? Actually, we can try A at a new position? But we know that A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 again, and the word has A, it would still be marked as ""-"" because it's at the same wrong position? Then we won't get new information? Better to move it.

 So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

 How about ""PLATE"":
   P at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Again position 3? Let me avoid.

 How about ""TALES"":
   T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> this puts A at 2 (which is different from 3) and E at 4 (different from 5). Also, avoids positions that we know are incorrect.

 Also, note: in ""crane"", position 1: C (not in word) -> so we can replace C with T or S, etc.

 Let me write the word: TALES
 But does it use any forbidden letters? C, R, N -> no. So it's okay.

 How about ""STALE""?
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 -> we don't want that if we can avoid.

 How about ""STEAL""?
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> this puts E at position 3 and A at position 4 (both new positions). And E is not at 5? And A not at 3? Actually, E at 3? We don't know if position 3 is available for E? We know E is not at 5, but it can be at 3? Yes, because we've never tested it at 3? Actually, we tested E at position 5 and it was wrong, but not at 3? So that's new.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses A at position 1 and E at position 2? For example, ""ADIEU""? But ADIEU has D and I, and also E is at position 4? Actually:
   ""ADIEU"": A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5 -> and E is at 4? But we also noted we haven't tested U? It's a vowel but not super common.

 However, ""STEAL"" seems better because it uses more common letters? But note that we have to avoid R, C, N. And we include S, T, E, A, L.

 Also, ""STEAL"" might help us if we get feedback on S, T, L.

 Another candidate: ""SLATE"" with A at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we shouldn't put it at 3 again? Because then we already know that if A is in the word, it's not at 3. Therefore, putting it at 3 again would still be wrong? And we don't learn anything? Actually, we might: if we put A at 3 again and we get a ""-"", that tells us that indeed it's in the word? Wait, we already know that. So we don't get new information on the position.

 Hence, we should try A at a position we haven't tested. Similarly for E.

 So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

 How about ""STALE""? That has A at 3 -> avoid.
 How about ""SLATE"" with A at 3 -> avoid.

 Alternatively, ""LEAFS"" (if valid): L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again position 3? Avoid.

 How about ""ADIEU""? 
   A: position 1 -> new position for A (since only tested at 3 before) -> good.
   E: position 4 -> new position (since tested only at 5) -> good.
   Also, we get to test D, I, U.

 However, U is less common? And we might want more common letters.

 How about ""PASTE""?
   P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but we know E cannot be at 5? So if we put E at 5, and the word has E, then we expect a ""-"" for E? But that's the same as before? So we don't learn if E can be at 5? Actually, we know already that E is not at 5? Then it must be elsewhere? Therefore, putting E at 5 again is futile? Because we already know it's not there? And we get a ""-"" if E is in the word? But that doesn't tell us where it might be? So we waste that slot.

 Therefore, we want E at a position that is not 5? And A at a position that is not 3? So ""PASTE"" has A at 2? That's a new position? But E at 5? We should avoid.

 How about ""STEAK"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, K at 5 -> this avoids A at 3? And E not at 5? Actually E is at 3? A at 4? Both new positions? And K is a common consonant.

 But note: we must avoid letters C, R, N -> and ""STEAK"" does not have them.

 So yes.

 Alternatively, ""STEAM"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, M at 5 -> same issue? E at 3? Then we might get new information? And we test M at 5? But M hasn't been tested? And E at position 3 is new? Because first guess we only had E at 5? So we don't know about position 3? Correct.

 However, note that the word does not have R, C, N? Both STEAM and STEAK are acceptable.

 But STEAM has M? We haven't tested M? So we can learn something.

 How about ""PLANE""? But it has N? Which we know is not in the word? But wait: first feedback says N is not in the word? So we shouldn't use N.

 Therefore, we must avoid N? So ""PLANE"" is invalid.

 Let me decide: I think ""TALES"" is a good candidate? 
   T at 1? We haven't tested position 1? 
   A at 2? New? 
   L at 3? 
   E at 4? New? 
   S at 5?

 But note: in the feedback, we don't know anything about position 1? Only that C was there and is wrong? So we can put T there? And since T is a common starting letter.

 Also, ""TALES"" contains:
   T: not tested before? 
   A: present, at position 2? 
   L: not tested? 
   E: present, at position 4? 
   S: not tested?

 We avoid C, R, N? Yes.

 But what if we get: A at position 2? What if the actual A is not at 2? Then we get ""A"" as ""-""? But we already know A is present? Then we know it's not at 2? Similarly for E? Then we get information? Actually, we would know that A is not at 2? And E not at 4? Then we can narrow down.

 Alternatively, we can maximize coverage: we have A and E to be placed in positions that are new? And three new letters: T, L, S.

 Also, we can consider: if the word has A at position 1, then we are not testing that? So maybe we can try including position 1? But we have T at 1? So if we get a ✓ on T? Then we know? Or if we get a ""-""? Then we know T is in the word? Etc.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but move A? We can't? Because we can't control? Or can we? We have to choose a word? How about ""SALET"" (if valid)? 
   S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> similar to TALES? And A at 2, E at 4.

 But SALET is a word? Yes, it's an old term for a helmet? But accepted in Wordle? Depends? But I think it is.

 However, TALES is more common.

 Another word: ""TEALS"" — teal is a color, plural? TEALS? Might not be accepted? So stick to TALES?

 But let me confirm: TALES is valid.

 So I'll go with ""TALES"".

 However, note: we have two words: TALES and STEAL? Which one? 
   STEAL: S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5? Then A is at 4? And E at 3? Both new? So why not STEAL?

 Actually, STEAL is a very common word. Also, S, T, E, A, L — same letters? Just arranged differently.

 But in STEAL: S at 1, T at 2? Which we haven't tested? And E at 3 (new position), A at 4 (new), L at 5? 
 We also avoid C, R, N? Yes.

 The advantage of STEAL: 
   Position 1: we test S? Which is a very common letter? And T next? 
   And A we get to put at 4? And E at 3? 

 But note: we already know A is present? So if we put A at 4? And if it's the correct location? We get a ✓? Or if it's not? Then we know it's elsewhere? Similarly for E? 

 Also, we get to test L at position 5? Which hasn't been tested? 

 How about compared to TALES? 
   TALES: position 1 is T? Then A at 2? Then E at 4? L at 3? S at 5? 

 Both arrangements are good? 

 But in the first guess, we tested letter E at position 5? And got ""-""? So if we put L at position 5? How do we know? We don't? But we'll test it? 

 Alternatively: the word has exactly 5 letters? And we know two: A and E? So three unknown? 

 Both STEAL and TALES test three new letters? So same? 

 How about frequency? 
   S is very common? T too? L less than S? So STEAL might be better because S is at the beginning? 

 But note: in the first guess, we didn't have S or T? So we are testing high-frequency letters? 

 However, STEAL has S and T at positions 1 and 2? Both common? 

 Also, STEAL the word is standard? 

 I'll choose STEAL? But wait: in STEAL, E is at position 3? We don't know? But in the actual word? We don't know? So it's good.

 But note: we must be able to interpret? 

 Alternatively, let's pick a word that doesn't put E at the end? Because we know it's not at the end? So any position that is not end? Well, we put E at 3? That's in the middle? So safe.

 Similarly, we put A at position 4? Not at 3? So safe.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""STEAL"".

 But let me double-check: STEAL? 
   S, T, E, A, L -> letters: S, T, E, A, L -> excludes C, R, N? Yes.

 So I'll use STEAL.

<guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not present, R not present, A present but not at position 3, N not present, E present but not at position 5), the new guess should:
- Include A and E (confirmed present)
- Avoid C, R, N (confirmed absent)
- Place A in a new position (not 3) and E in a new position (not 5) to test different locations
- Incorporate common unverified letters like S, T, and L to maximize information

""STEAL"" meets these criteria:
- S, T, E, A, L avoids C/R/N
- Places A at position 4 (new)
- Places E at position 3 (new)
- Tests high-frequency consonants S, T, and L
- Valid 5-letter English word

<guess>steal</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
  - C, R, N are not in the word.
  - A is in the word but not at position 3.
  - E is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""steal"" -> S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
Meaning:
  - S is in the word and at the correct position (position 1).
  - T is in the word and at the correct position (position 2).
  - E is in the word and at the correct position (position 3).
  - A is in the word and at the correct position (position 4).
  - L is not in the word.

So, from the second guess, we know:
  - The word starts with ""S"" and the second letter is ""T"", the third is ""E"", and the fourth is ""A"". 
  - The word is S T E A _ 
  - The last letter is missing, and we know it's not L (and also not C, R, N from the first guess).

Additionally, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, N, L.

We also know from the first guess that E is not at position 5 (but now we have it at position 3, which is correct) and A is not at position 3 (now at position 4, which is correct). So that is consistent.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""STEA"" and the last letter is not C, R, N, L.

What are the possible last letters? We need to consider common English letters that are not in the exclusion list.

Exclusion list: C, R, N, L.

Possible letters for the last position: any letter except C, R, N, L, and also we must consider that the word must be valid.

Common words that start with ""STEA"":
- STEAD
- STEAK
- STEAL (but we tried and L is not in the word, so not this)
- STEAM
- STEAR (but R is excluded, so not)
- STEAN? (not a word, and N is excluded)

So the common ones are: STEAD, STEAK, STEAM.

We already know that L is not in the word, so STEAL is out.

Now, we have to choose one. We can try one of these.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to get it in one shot? But we don't know which one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we already have 4 letters fixed: S, T, E, A. So we only need to find the last letter.

But we don't have a word that tests multiple last letters? Because we can only test one word.

So we have to guess one of the possibilities.

Let's list the possibilities again:

- STEAD: D at the end
- STEAK: K at the end
- STEAM: M at the end
- STEA? any others? 
  - STEA? STEAN? not a word.
  - STEAR? not allowed because R is excluded.
  - STEAX? not a word.
  - STEAB? not a word.

So only STEAD, STEAK, STEAM.

We can try one of these. How to choose? We can consider frequency.

In English, ""STEAM"" is very common, as is ""STEAK"". ""STEAD"" is less common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can look at the feedback: we have no information about D, K, M? So we have to guess.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to guess one and if wrong, then the next.

But we can also think: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was wrong? But now we have E at position 3? So that doesn't help.

Another idea: we can use a word that has the same structure? But we don't have to, because we have 4 letters fixed.

So I think we should just pick one. Let's pick ""STEAM"" because it's common.

But wait: we have to make sure that M is not excluded? We haven't tested M? And it's not in the exclusion list? So it's possible.

Similarly, D and K are not excluded.

So I'll go with ""STEAM"".

But note: the feedback for the second guess said L is not in the word? So we avoid L? And we are avoiding C, R, N? So STEAM is safe.

Therefore, the next guess is ""STEAM"".

But let me confirm: 
  Position 1: S (correct) -> we know it's S
  Position 2: T (correct) -> we know it's T
  Position 3: E (correct) -> we know it's E
  Position 4: A (correct) -> we know it's A
  Position 5: M (to be tested)

If it's correct, we win. If not, then we know it's either D or K? Then we can try STEAD or STEAK next.

But we are on the third guess? So we have three more guesses? So it's safe.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use the known positions? But that would be inefficient? Because we already have 4 letters fixed? Why not use that?

So I think ""STEAM"" is a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""STEAM"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 or 5. C, R, and N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (steal)**: S, T, E, and A are correct and in the exact positions (positions 1, 2, 3, and 4). L is absent.

This means:
- The word starts with **STEA** (positions 1–4 are S, T, E, A).
- The last letter (position 5) is missing and must be a letter not yet excluded (excluded: C, R, N, L).
- Possible words: **STEAD** (D), **STEAK** (K), or **STEAM** (M).

To solve the word, I'll guess **STEAM** to test if M is the final letter. If incorrect, the solution must be STEAD or STEAK.

But for the next guess, let\'s assume no duplicates to maximize coverage.\n\n Also, we want to test other vowels or common consonants.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, P, etc.\n\n Let me think of words that have A and E, and don\'t have C, R, N.\n\n Example: ""LATER"", ""SLATE"", ""LEAST"", etc.\n\n However, note:\n   In ""crane"", the A was at position 3 and E at position 5. So we must move them.\n\n How about a word where A is at position 1? Then E cannot be at position 5? But E can be anywhere except 5? Actually, we know for the first guess that E was at position 5 and was wrong. That does not prevent E from being at position 5 in the actual word? Wait, no: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, E cannot be at position 5. Similarly, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position, so A cannot be at position 3.\n\n Therefore:\n   Positions where A can be: 1, 2, 4\n   Positions where E can be: 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.\n\n Let me pick a word that uses common letters and places A and E in new positions.\n\n Consider ""SLATE"":\n   S at position 1, L at 2, A at 3? Wait, but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because the feedback for the first guess said A was at position 3 and was wrong? Actually, no: the first guess had A at position 3 and we were told it\'s not there. So in ""SLATE"", putting A at position 3 is the same position? That would still be wrong? But we want to test A at a new position.\n\n Alternatively, ""LEAST"":\n   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 for A? Not allowed? Actually, we can try A at a new position? But we know that A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 again, and the word has A, it would still be marked as ""-"" because it\'s at the same wrong position? Then we won\'t get new information? Better to move it.\n\n So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.\n\n How about ""PLATE"":\n   P at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Again position 3? Let me avoid.\n\n How about ""TALES"":\n   T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> this puts A at 2 (which is different from 3) and E at 4 (different from 5). Also, avoids positions that we know are incorrect.\n\n Also, note: in ""crane"", position 1: C (not in word) -> so we can replace C with T or S, etc.\n\n Let me write the word: TALES\n But does it use any forbidden letters? C, R, N -> no. So it\'s okay.\n\n How about ""STALE""?\n   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 -> we don\'t want that if we can avoid.\n\n How about ""STEAL""?\n   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> this puts E at position 3 and A at position 4 (both new positions). And E is not at 5? And A not at 3? Actually, E at 3? We don\'t know if position 3 is available for E? We know E is not at 5, but it can be at 3? Yes, because we\'ve never tested it at 3? Actually, we tested E at position 5 and it was wrong, but not at 3? So that\'s new.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses A at position 1 and E at position 2? For example, ""ADIEU""? But ADIEU has D and I, and also E is at position 4? Actually:\n   ""ADIEU"": A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5 -> and E is at 4? But we also noted we haven\'t tested U? It\'s a vowel but not super common.\n\n However, ""STEAL"" seems better because it uses more common letters? But note that we have to avoid R, C, N. And we include S, T, E, A, L.\n\n Also, ""STEAL"" might help us if we get feedback on S, T, L.\n\n Another candidate: ""SLATE"" with A at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we shouldn\'t put it at 3 again? Because then we already know that if A is in the word, it\'s not at 3. Therefore, putting it at 3 again would still be wrong? And we don\'t learn anything? Actually, we might: if we put A at 3 again and we get a ""-"", that tells us that indeed it\'s in the word? Wait, we already know that. So we don\'t get new information on the position.\n\n Hence, we should try A at a position we haven\'t tested. Similarly for E.\n\n So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.\n\n How about ""STALE""? That has A at 3 -> avoid.\n How about ""SLATE"" with A at 3 -> avoid.\n\n Alternatively, ""LEAFS"" (if valid): L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again position 3? Avoid.\n\n How about ""ADIEU""? \n   A: position 1 -> new position for A (since only tested at 3 before) -> good.\n   E: position 4 -> new position (since tested only at 5) -> good.\n   Also, we get to test D, I, U.\n\n However, U is less common? And we might want more common letters.\n\n How about ""PASTE""?\n   P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but we know E cannot be at 5? So if we put E at 5, and the word has E, then we expect a ""-"" for E? But that\'s the same as before? So we don\'t learn if E can be at 5? Actually, we know already that E is not at 5? Then it must be elsewhere? Therefore, putting E at 5 again is futile? Because we already know it\'s not there? And we get a ""-"" if E is in the word? But that doesn\'t tell us where it might be? So we waste that slot.\n\n Therefore, we want E at a position that is not 5? And A at a position that is not 3? So ""PASTE"" has A at 2? That\'s a new position? But E at 5? We should avoid.\n\n How about ""STEAK"": \n   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, K at 5 -> this avoids A at 3? And E not at 5? Actually E is at 3? A at 4? Both new positions? And K is a common consonant.\n\n But note: we must avoid letters C, R, N -> and ""STEAK"" does not have them.\n\n So yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""STEAM"": \n   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, M at 5 -> same issue? E at 3? Then we might get new information? And we test M at 5? But M hasn\'t been tested? And E at position 3 is new? Because first guess we only had E at 5? So we don\'t know about position 3? Correct.\n\n However, note that the word does not have R, C, N? Both STEAM and STEAK are acceptable.\n\n But STEAM has M? We haven\'t tested M? So we can learn something.\n\n How about ""PLANE""? But it has N? Which we know is not in the word? But wait: first feedback says N is not in the word? So we shouldn\'t use N.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid N? So ""PLANE"" is invalid.\n\n Let me decide: I think ""TALES"" is a good candidate? \n   T at 1? We haven\'t tested position 1? \n   A at 2? New? \n   L at 3? \n   E at 4? New? \n   S at 5?\n\n But note: in the feedback, we don\'t know anything about position 1? Only that C was there and is wrong? So we can put T there? And since T is a common starting letter.\n\n Also, ""TALES"" contains:\n   T: not tested before? \n   A: present, at position 2? \n   L: not tested? \n   E: present, at position 4? \n   S: not tested?\n\n We avoid C, R, N? Yes.\n\n But what if we get: A at position 2? What if the actual A is not at 2? Then we get ""A"" as ""-""? But we already know A is present? Then we know it\'s not at 2? Similarly for E? Then we get information? Actually, we would know that A is not at 2? And E not at 4? Then we can narrow down.\n\n Alternatively, we can maximize coverage: we have A and E to be placed in positions that are new? And three new letters: T, L, S.\n\n Also, we can consider: if the word has A at position 1, then we are not testing that? So maybe we can try including position 1? But we have T at 1? So if we get a ✓ on T? Then we know? Or if we get a ""-""? Then we know T is in the word? Etc.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but move A? We can\'t? Because we can\'t control? Or can we? We have to choose a word? How about ""SALET"" (if valid)? \n   S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> similar to TALES? And A at 2, E at 4.\n\n But SALET is a word? Yes, it\'s an old term for a helmet? But accepted in Wordle? Depends? But I think it is.\n\n However, TALES is more common.\n\n Another word: ""TEALS"" — teal is a color, plural? TEALS? Might not be accepted? So stick to TALES?\n\n But let me confirm: TALES is valid.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""TALES"".\n\n However, note: we have two words: TALES and STEAL? Which one? \n   STEAL: S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5? Then A is at 4? And E at 3? Both new? So why not STEAL?\n\n Actually, STEAL is a very common word. Also, S, T, E, A, L — same letters? Just arranged differently.\n\n But in STEAL: S at 1, T at 2? Which we haven\'t tested? And E at 3 (new position), A at 4 (new), L at 5? \n We also avoid C, R, N? Yes.\n\n The advantage of STEAL: \n   Position 1: we test S? Which is a very common letter? And T next? \n   And A we get to put at 4? And E at 3? \n\n But note: we already know A is present? So if we put A at 4? And if it\'s the correct location? We get a ✓? Or if it\'s not? Then we know it\'s elsewhere? Similarly for E? \n\n Also, we get to test L at position 5? Which hasn\'t been tested? \n\n How about compared to TALES? \n   TALES: position 1 is T? Then A at 2? Then E at 4? L at 3? S at 5? \n\n Both arrangements are good? \n\n But in the first guess, we tested letter E at position 5? And got ""-""? So if we put L at position 5? How do we know? We don\'t? But we\'ll test it? \n\n Alternatively: the word has exactly 5 letters? And we know two: A and E? So three unknown? \n\n Both STEAL and TALES test three new letters? So same? \n\n How about frequency? \n   S is very common? T too? L less than S? So STEAL might be better because S is at the beginning? \n\n But note: in the first guess, we didn\'t have S or T? So we are testing high-frequency letters? \n\n However, STEAL has S and T at positions 1 and 2? Both common? \n\n Also, STEAL the word is standard? \n\n I\'ll choose STEAL? But wait: in STEAL, E is at position 3? We don\'t know? But in the actual word? We don\'t know? So it\'s good.\n\n But note: we must be able to interpret? \n\n Alternatively, let\'s pick a word that doesn\'t put E at the end? Because we know it\'s not at the end? So any position that is not end? Well, we put E at 3? That\'s in the middle? So safe.\n\n Similarly, we put A at position 4? Not at 3? So safe.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""STEAL"".\n\n But let me double-check: STEAL? \n   S, T, E, A, L -> letters: S, T, E, A, L -> excludes C, R, N? Yes.\n\n So I\'ll use STEAL.\n\n<guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not present, R not present, A present but not at position 3, N not present, E present but not at position 5), the new guess should:\n- Include A and E (confirmed present)\n- Avoid C, R, N (confirmed absent)\n- Place A in a new position (not 3) and E in a new position (not 5) to test different locations\n- Incorporate common unverified letters like S, T, and L to maximize information\n\n""STEAL"" meets these criteria:\n- S, T, E, A, L avoids C/R/N\n- Places A at position 4 (new)\n- Places E at position 3 (new)\n- Tests high-frequency consonants S, T, and L\n- Valid 5-letter English word\n\n<guess>steal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n  - C, R, N are not in the word.\n  - A is in the word but not at position 3.\n  - E is in the word but not at position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""steal"" -> S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)\nMeaning:\n  - S is in the word and at the correct position (position 1).\n  - T is in the word and at the correct position (position 2).\n  - E is in the word and at the correct position (position 3).\n  - A is in the word and at the correct position (position 4).\n  - L is not in the word.\n\nSo, from the second guess, we know:\n  - The word starts with ""S"" and the second letter is ""T"", the third is ""E"", and the fourth is ""A"". \n  - The word is S T E A _ \n  - The last letter is missing, and we know it\'s not L (and also not C, R, N from the first guess).\n\nAdditionally, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, N, L.\n\nWe also know from the first guess that E is not at position 5 (but now we have it at position 3, which is correct) and A is not at position 3 (now at position 4, which is correct). So that is consistent.\n\nNow, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""STEA"" and the last letter is not C, R, N, L.\n\nWhat are the possible last letters? We need to consider common English letters that are not in the exclusion list.\n\nExclusion list: C, R, N, L.\n\nPossible letters for the last position: any letter except C, R, N, L, and also we must consider that the word must be valid.\n\nCommon words that start with ""STEA"":\n- STEAD\n- STEAK\n- STEAL (but we tried and L is not in the word, so not this)\n- STEAM\n- STEAR (but R is excluded, so not)\n- STEAN?

We can try one of these.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to get it in one shot? But we don\'t know which one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we already have 4 letters fixed: S, T, E, A. So we only need to find the last letter.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that tests multiple last letters? Because we can only test one word.\n\nSo we have to guess one of the possibilities.\n\nLet\'s list the possibilities again:\n\n- STEAD: D at the end\n- STEAK: K at the end\n- STEAM: M at the end\n- STEA? any others? \n  - STEA? STEAN? not a word.\n  - STEAR? not allowed because R is excluded.\n  - STEAX? not a word.\n  - STEAB? not a word.\n\nSo only STEAD, STEAK, STEAM.\n\nWe can try one of these. How to choose? We can consider frequency.\n\nIn English, ""STEAM"" is very common, as is ""STEAK"". ""STEAD"" is less common? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the feedback: we have no information about D, K, M? So we have to guess.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to guess one and if wrong, then the next.\n\nBut we can also think: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was wrong? But now we have E at position 3? So that doesn\'t help.\n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that has the same structure? But we don\'t have to, because we have 4 letters fixed.\n\nSo I think we should just pick one. Let\'s pick ""STEAM"" because it\'s common.\n\nBut wait: we have to make sure that M is not excluded? We haven\'t tested M? And it\'s not in the exclusion list? So it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, D and K are not excluded.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STEAM"".\n\nBut note: the feedback for the second guess said L is not in the word? So we avoid L? And we are avoiding C, R, N? So STEAM is safe.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""STEAM"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  Position 1: S (correct) -> we know it\'s S\n  Position 2: T (correct) -> we know it\'s T\n  Position 3: E (correct) -> we know it\'s E\n  Position 4: A (correct) -> we know it\'s A\n  Position 5: M (to be tested)\n\nIf it\'s correct, we win. If not, then we know it\'s either D or K? Then we can try STEAD or STEAK next.\n\nBut we are on the third guess? So we have three more guesses? So it\'s safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t use the known positions? But that would be inefficient? Because we already have 4 letters fixed?

  T: correct (✓) at position 2
  E: correct (✓) at position 3
  A: correct (✓) at position 4
  M: absent (x)

From Guess 2 and Guess 3, we know:
- The first four letters are S, T, E, A in that order. So the word is ""STEA_"".
- The last letter is missing, and we know it cannot be L (from Guess 2) or M (from Guess 3). Also, from Guess 1, we know it cannot be C, R, or N.

Therefore, the word must be ""STEA"" followed by a letter that is not C, R, N, L, or M.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits this pattern.

Common words starting with ""STEA"":
- STEAD (D at the end)
- STEAK (K at the end)
- STEAM (we tried, M is absent)
- STEAL (we tried, L is absent)

Other possibilities? 
- STEA? There is also ""STEAR"" but R is absent (from Guess 1), so not possible.
- STEAN? Not a word.

So the only common words left are:
- STEAD (with D)
- STEAK (with K)

We have two possibilities. We need to choose one for the next guess.

We are on the fourth guess. We can try one of them.

Let's consider the frequency of D and K? Or we can pick one arbitrarily.

Alternatively, we can think if there are any other words? But in common English, these are the main ones.

We can try ""STEAD"". If it's not that, then it must be ""STEAK"".

So I'll go with ""STEAD"" for the next guess.

But note: we have to make sure that D is not excluded? We haven't tested D? So it's possible.

Similarly, K is not excluded.

So let's guess ""STEAD"".

If it's correct, we win. If not, then we know it's ""STEAK"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""STEAD"".

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A and E are present but not at positions 3 or 5. C, R, and N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (steal)**: S, T, E, and A are correct in positions 1–4. L is absent.
- **Guess 3 (steam)**: S, T, E, and A are correct in positions 1–4. M is absent.

### Key Insights:
1. The word starts with **STEA** (positions 1–4 confirmed).
2. The last letter (position 5) must be a letter not yet excluded:  
   - Excluded letters: **C, R, N, L, M** (from all feedback).
   - Possible candidates: **D** (STEAD) or **K** (STEAK), as these are the only common English words fitting the pattern.

### Next Guess Strategy:

   A: in the word but wrong position (-)
   N: in the word? Actually, it says (x) so N is not in the word? But wait, let me read carefully: N(x) -> not in the word.
   E: in the word but wrong position (-)

 Correction: The feedback says:
   C: x (not in the word)
   R: x (not in the word)
   A: - (in the word, but not in the correct position)
   N: x (not in the word)
   E: - (in the word, but not in the correct position)

 So we know:
   Letters in the word: A and E (but not in the positions they were in ""crane"").
   Letters not in the word: C, R, N.

 Positions in the word (from ""crane""):
   Position 1: C -> not in word -> so the word does not start with C.
   Position 2: R -> not in word -> so the second letter isn't R.
   Position 3: A -> is in the word, but not at position 3. So A must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5? Wait, but note: we have 5 positions.
   Position 4: N -> not in word -> so the fourth letter isn't N.
   Position 5: E -> is in the word, but not at position 5. So E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.

 Since we know A and E are in the word, we should try a word that includes A and E (and excludes C, R, N) and places them in different positions.

 Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Possible strategy: choose a word that has A and E in positions that are not 3 and 5 (since we know in ""crane"" they were wrong there) and also include other common letters.

 Since position 3 was A and that was wrong, and position 5 was E and that was wrong, we can try placing A and E elsewhere.

 We must avoid using C, R, N.

 Consider: 
   A cannot be at position 3? Actually, it can be elsewhere. But note, the ""-"" means it is in the word but not at that position. So A could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But wait, we have:
   Position 1: cannot be C (we know) and also note that A might be there? But we don't know yet.

 However, note that the word has 5 letters and we know two of them: A and E. And we have three unknown letters.

 We should choose a word that:
   - Includes A and E (but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively? Not necessarily, because if the word has duplicate letters then it might be, but we don't know. However, the feedback for ""crane"" doesn't indicate duplicates. Since A and E were marked as present only once, and in the wrong positions, we assume that at least one A and one E are present. But there could be duplicates? We don't know. But for the next guess, let's assume no duplicates to maximize coverage.

 Also, we want to test other vowels or common consonants.

 Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, P, etc.

 Let me think of words that have A and E, and don't have C, R, N.

 Example: ""LATER"", ""SLATE"", ""LEAST"", etc.

 However, note:
   In ""crane"", the A was at position 3 and E at position 5. So we must move them.

 How about a word where A is at position 1? Then E cannot be at position 5? But E can be anywhere except 5? Actually, we know for the first guess that E was at position 5 and was wrong. That does not prevent E from being at position 5 in the actual word? Wait, no: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, E cannot be at position 5. Similarly, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position, so A cannot be at position 3.

 Therefore:
   Positions where A can be: 1, 2, 4
   Positions where E can be: 1, 2, 3, 4

 Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.

 Let me pick a word that uses common letters and places A and E in new positions.

 Consider ""SLATE"":
   S at position 1, L at 2, A at 3? Wait, but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because the feedback for the first guess said A was at position 3 and was wrong? Actually, no: the first guess had A at position 3 and we were told it's not there. So in ""SLATE"", putting A at position 3 is the same position? That would still be wrong? But we want to test A at a new position.

 Alternatively, ""LEAST"":
   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 for A? Not allowed? Actually, we can try A at a new position? But we know that A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 again, and the word has A, it would still be marked as ""-"" because it's at the same wrong position? Then we won't get new information? Better to move it.

 So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

 How about ""PLATE"":
   P at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Again position 3? Let me avoid.

 How about ""TALES"":
   T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> this puts A at 2 (which is different from 3) and E at 4 (different from 5). Also, avoids positions that we know are incorrect.

 Also, note: in ""crane"", position 1: C (not in word) -> so we can replace C with T or S, etc.

 Let me write the word: TALES
 But does it use any forbidden letters? C, R, N -> no. So it's okay.

 How about ""STALE""?
   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 -> we don't want that if we can avoid.

 How about ""STEAL""?
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> this puts E at position 3 and A at position 4 (both new positions). And E is not at 5? And A not at 3? Actually, E at 3? We don't know if position 3 is available for E? We know E is not at 5, but it can be at 3? Yes, because we've never tested it at 3? Actually, we tested E at position 5 and it was wrong, but not at 3? So that's new.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses A at position 1 and E at position 2? For example, ""ADIEU""? But ADIEU has D and I, and also E is at position 4? Actually:
   ""ADIEU"": A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5 -> and E is at 4? But we also noted we haven't tested U? It's a vowel but not super common.

 However, ""STEAL"" seems better because it uses more common letters? But note that we have to avoid R, C, N. And we include S, T, E, A, L.

 Also, ""STEAL"" might help us if we get feedback on S, T, L.

 Another candidate: ""SLATE"" with A at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we shouldn't put it at 3 again? Because then we already know that if A is in the word, it's not at 3. Therefore, putting it at 3 again would still be wrong? And we don't learn anything? Actually, we might: if we put A at 3 again and we get a ""-"", that tells us that indeed it's in the word? Wait, we already know that. So we don't get new information on the position.

 Hence, we should try A at a position we haven't tested. Similarly for E.

 So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.

 How about ""STALE""? That has A at 3 -> avoid.
 How about ""SLATE"" with A at 3 -> avoid.

 Alternatively, ""LEAFS"" (if valid): L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again position 3? Avoid.

 How about ""ADIEU""? 
   A: position 1 -> new position for A (since only tested at 3 before) -> good.
   E: position 4 -> new position (since tested only at 5) -> good.
   Also, we get to test D, I, U.

 However, U is less common? And we might want more common letters.

 How about ""PASTE""?
   P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but we know E cannot be at 5? So if we put E at 5, and the word has E, then we expect a ""-"" for E? But that's the same as before? So we don't learn if E can be at 5? Actually, we know already that E is not at 5? Then it must be elsewhere? Therefore, putting E at 5 again is futile? Because we already know it's not there? And we get a ""-"" if E is in the word? But that doesn't tell us where it might be? So we waste that slot.

 Therefore, we want E at a position that is not 5? And A at a position that is not 3? So ""PASTE"" has A at 2? That's a new position? But E at 5? We should avoid.

 How about ""STEAK"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, K at 5 -> this avoids A at 3? And E not at 5? Actually E is at 3? A at 4? Both new positions? And K is a common consonant.

 But note: we must avoid letters C, R, N -> and ""STEAK"" does not have them.

 So yes.

 Alternatively, ""STEAM"": 
   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, M at 5 -> same issue? E at 3? Then we might get new information? And we test M at 5? But M hasn't been tested? And E at position 3 is new? Because first guess we only had E at 5? So we don't know about position 3? Correct.

 However, note that the word does not have R, C, N? Both STEAM and STEAK are acceptable.

 But STEAM has M? We haven't tested M? So we can learn something.

 How about ""PLANE""? But it has N? Which we know is not in the word? But wait: first feedback says N is not in the word? So we shouldn't use N.

 Therefore, we must avoid N? So ""PLANE"" is invalid.

 Let me decide: I think ""TALES"" is a good candidate? 
   T at 1? We haven't tested position 1? 
   A at 2? New? 
   L at 3? 
   E at 4? New? 
   S at 5?

 But note: in the feedback, we don't know anything about position 1? Only that C was there and is wrong? So we can put T there? And since T is a common starting letter.

 Also, ""TALES"" contains:
   T: not tested before? 
   A: present, at position 2? 
   L: not tested? 
   E: present, at position 4? 
   S: not tested?

 We avoid C, R, N? Yes.

 But what if we get: A at position 2? What if the actual A is not at 2? Then we get ""A"" as ""-""? But we already know A is present? Then we know it's not at 2? Similarly for E? Then we get information? Actually, we would know that A is not at 2? And E not at 4? Then we can narrow down.

 Alternatively, we can maximize coverage: we have A and E to be placed in positions that are new? And three new letters: T, L, S.

 Also, we can consider: if the word has A at position 1, then we are not testing that? So maybe we can try including position 1? But we have T at 1? So if we get a ✓ on T? Then we know? Or if we get a ""-""? Then we know T is in the word? Etc.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but move A? We can't? Because we can't control? Or can we? We have to choose a word? How about ""SALET"" (if valid)? 
   S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> similar to TALES? And A at 2, E at 4.

 But SALET is a word? Yes, it's an old term for a helmet? But accepted in Wordle? Depends? But I think it is.

 However, TALES is more common.

 Another word: ""TEALS"" — teal is a color, plural? TEALS? Might not be accepted? So stick to TALES?

 But let me confirm: TALES is valid.

 So I'll go with ""TALES"".

 However, note: we have two words: TALES and STEAL? Which one? 
   STEAL: S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5? Then A is at 4? And E at 3? Both new? So why not STEAL?

 Actually, STEAL is a very common word. Also, S, T, E, A, L — same letters? Just arranged differently.

 But in STEAL: S at 1, T at 2? Which we haven't tested? And E at 3 (new position), A at 4 (new), L at 5? 
 We also avoid C, R, N? Yes.

 The advantage of STEAL: 
   Position 1: we test S? Which is a very common letter? And T next? 
   And A we get to put at 4? And E at 3? 

 But note: we already know A is present? So if we put A at 4? And if it's the correct location? We get a ✓? Or if it's not? Then we know it's elsewhere? Similarly for E? 

 Also, we get to test L at position 5? Which hasn't been tested? 

 How about compared to TALES? 
   TALES: position 1 is T? Then A at 2? Then E at 4? L at 3? S at 5? 

 Both arrangements are good? 

 But in the first guess, we tested letter E at position 5? And got ""-""? So if we put L at position 5? How do we know? We don't? But we'll test it? 

 Alternatively: the word has exactly 5 letters? And we know two: A and E? So three unknown? 

 Both STEAL and TALES test three new letters? So same? 

 How about frequency? 
   S is very common? T too? L less than S? So STEAL might be better because S is at the beginning? 

 But note: in the first guess, we didn't have S or T? So we are testing high-frequency letters? 

 However, STEAL has S and T at positions 1 and 2? Both common? 

 Also, STEAL the word is standard? 

 I'll choose STEAL? But wait: in STEAL, E is at position 3? We don't know? But in the actual word? We don't know? So it's good.

 But note: we must be able to interpret? 

 Alternatively, let's pick a word that doesn't put E at the end? Because we know it's not at the end? So any position that is not end? Well, we put E at 3? That's in the middle? So safe.

 Similarly, we put A at position 4? Not at 3? So safe.

 Therefore, I'll go with ""STEAL"".

 But let me double-check: STEAL? 
   S, T, E, A, L -> letters: S, T, E, A, L -> excludes C, R, N? Yes.

 So I'll use STEAL.

<guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not present, R not present, A present but not at position 3, N not present, E present but not at position 5), the new guess should:
- Include A and E (confirmed present)
- Avoid C, R, N (confirmed absent)
- Place A in a new position (not 3) and E in a new position (not 5) to test different locations
- Incorporate common unverified letters like S, T, and L to maximize information

""STEAL"" meets these criteria:
- S, T, E, A, L avoids C/R/N
- Places A at position 4 (new)
- Places E at position 3 (new)
- Tests high-frequency consonants S, T, and L
- Valid 5-letter English word

<guess>steal</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
  - C, R, N are not in the word.
  - A is in the word but not at position 3.
  - E is in the word but not at position 5.

Guess 2: ""steal"" -> S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
Meaning:
  - S is in the word and at the correct position (position 1).
  - T is in the word and at the correct position (position 2).
  - E is in the word and at the correct position (position 3).
  - A is in the word and at the correct position (position 4).
  - L is not in the word.

So, from the second guess, we know:
  - The word starts with ""S"" and the second letter is ""T"", the third is ""E"", and the fourth is ""A"". 
  - The word is S T E A _ 
  - The last letter is missing, and we know it's not L (and also not C, R, N from the first guess).

Additionally, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, N, L.

We also know from the first guess that E is not at position 5 (but now we have it at position 3, which is correct) and A is not at position 3 (now at position 4, which is correct). So that is consistent.

Now, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""STEA"" and the last letter is not C, R, N, L.

What are the possible last letters? We need to consider common English letters that are not in the exclusion list.

Exclusion list: C, R, N, L.

Possible letters for the last position: any letter except C, R, N, L, and also we must consider that the word must be valid.

Common words that start with ""STEA"":
- STEAD
- STEAK
- STEAL (but we tried and L is not in the word, so not this)
- STEAM
- STEAR (but R is excluded, so not)
- STEAN? (not a word, and N is excluded)

So the common ones are: STEAD, STEAK, STEAM.

We already know that L is not in the word, so STEAL is out.

Now, we have to choose one. We can try one of these.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to get it in one shot? But we don't know which one.

Alternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we already have 4 letters fixed: S, T, E, A. So we only need to find the last letter.

But we don't have a word that tests multiple last letters? Because we can only test one word.

So we have to guess one of the possibilities.

Let's list the possibilities again:

- STEAD: D at the end
- STEAK: K at the end
- STEAM: M at the end
- STEA? any others? 
  - STEA? STEAN? not a word.
  - STEAR? not allowed because R is excluded.
  - STEAX? not a word.
  - STEAB? not a word.

So only STEAD, STEAK, STEAM.

We can try one of these. How to choose? We can consider frequency.

In English, ""STEAM"" is very common, as is ""STEAK"". ""STEAD"" is less common? But we don't know.

Alternatively, we can look at the feedback: we have no information about D, K, M? So we have to guess.

But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to guess one and if wrong, then the next.

But we can also think: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was wrong? But now we have E at position 3? So that doesn't help.

Another idea: we can use a word that has the same structure? But we don't have to, because we have 4 letters fixed.

So I think we should just pick one. Let's pick ""STEAM"" because it's common.

But wait: we have to make sure that M is not excluded? We haven't tested M? And it's not in the exclusion list? So it's possible.

Similarly, D and K are not excluded.

So I'll go with ""STEAM"".

But note: the feedback for the second guess said L is not in the word? So we avoid L? And we are avoiding C, R, N? So STEAM is safe.

Therefore, the next guess is ""STEAM"".

But let me confirm: 
  Position 1: S (correct) -> we know it's S
  Position 2: T (correct) -> we know it's T
  Position 3: E (correct) -> we know it's E
  Position 4: A (correct) -> we know it's A
  Position 5: M (to be tested)

If it's correct, we win. If not, then we know it's either D or K? Then we can try STEAD or STEAK next.

But we are on the third guess? So we have three more guesses? So it's safe.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't use the known positions? But that would be inefficient? Because we already have 4 letters fixed? Why not use that?

So I think ""STEAM"" is a good guess.

Therefore, the next guess is ""STEAM"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 or 5. C, R, and N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (steal)**: S, T, E, and A are correct and in the exact positions (positions 1, 2, 3, and 4). L is absent.

This means:
- The word starts with **STEA** (positions 1–4 are S, T, E, A).
- The last letter (position 5) is missing and must be a letter not yet excluded (excluded: C, R, N, L).
- Possible words: **STEAD** (D), **STEAK** (K), or **STEAM** (M).

To solve the word, I'll guess **STEAM** to test if M is the final letter. If incorrect, the solution must be STEAD or STEAK.

<guess>steam</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)
Guess 3: steam -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) M(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> 
  C: absent (x)
  R: absent (x)
  A: present, wrong position (-)
  N: absent (x)
  E: present, wrong position (-)

Guess 2: ""steal"" ->
  S: correct (✓) at position 1
  T: correct (✓) at position 2
  E: correct (✓) at position 3
  A: correct (✓) at position 4
  L: absent (x)

Guess 3: ""steam"" ->
  S: correct (✓) at position 1
  T: correct (✓) at position 2
  E: correct (✓) at position 3
  A: correct (✓) at position 4
  M: absent (x)

From Guess 2 and Guess 3, we know:
- The first four letters are S, T, E, A in that order. So the word is ""STEA_"".
- The last letter is missing, and we know it cannot be L (from Guess 2) or M (from Guess 3). Also, from Guess 1, we know it cannot be C, R, or N.

Therefore, the word must be ""STEA"" followed by a letter that is not C, R, N, L, or M.

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits this pattern.

Common words starting with ""STEA"":
- STEAD (D at the end)
- STEAK (K at the end)
- STEAM (we tried, M is absent)
- STEAL (we tried, L is absent)

Other possibilities? 
- STEA? There is also ""STEAR"" but R is absent (from Guess 1), so not possible.
- STEAN? Not a word.

So the only common words left are:
- STEAD (with D)
- STEAK (with K)

We have two possibilities. We need to choose one for the next guess.

We are on the fourth guess. We can try one of them.

Let's consider the frequency of D and K? Or we can pick one arbitrarily.

Alternatively, we can think if there are any other words? But in common English, these are the main ones.

We can try ""STEAD"". If it's not that, then it must be ""STEAK"".

So I'll go with ""STEAD"" for the next guess.

But note: we have to make sure that D is not excluded? We haven't tested D? So it's possible.

Similarly, K is not excluded.

So let's guess ""STEAD"".

If it's correct, we win. If not, then we know it's ""STEAK"".

Therefore, the next guess is ""STEAD"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A and E are present but not at positions 3 or 5. C, R, and N are absent.
- **Guess 2 (steal)**: S, T, E, and A are correct in positions 1–4. L is absent.
- **Guess 3 (steam)**: S, T, E, and A are correct in positions 1–4. M is absent.

### Key Insights:
1. The word starts with **STEA** (positions 1–4 confirmed).
2. The last letter (position 5) must be a letter not yet excluded:  
   - Excluded letters: **C, R, N, L, M** (from all feedback).
   - Possible candidates: **D** (STEAD) or **K** (STEAK), as these are the only common English words fitting the pattern.

### Next Guess Strategy:
- Since only two options remain, I'll test **STEAD** to check if ""D"" is the final letter. If incorrect, the solution must be **STEAK**.

Wait, but note: we have 5 positions.\n   Position 4: N -> not in word -> so the fourth letter isn\'t N.\n   Position 5: E -> is in the word, but not at position 5. So E must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.\n\n Since we know A and E are in the word, we should try a word that includes A and E (and excludes C, R, N) and places them in different positions.\n\n Moreover, we want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\n Possible strategy: choose a word that has A and E in positions that are not 3 and 5 (since we know in ""crane"" they were wrong there) and also include other common letters.\n\n Since position 3 was A and that was wrong, and position 5 was E and that was wrong, we can try placing A and E elsewhere.\n\n We must avoid using C, R, N.\n\n Consider: \n   A cannot be at position 3? Actually, it can be elsewhere. But note, the ""-"" means it is in the word but not at that position. So A could be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5? But wait, we have:\n   Position 1: cannot be C (we know) and also note that A might be there? But we don\'t know yet.\n\n However, note that the word has 5 letters and we know two of them: A and E. And we have three unknown letters.\n\n We should choose a word that:\n   - Includes A and E (but not at positions 3 and 5 respectively? Not necessarily, because if the word has duplicate letters then it might be, but we don\'t know. However, the feedback for ""crane"" doesn\'t indicate duplicates. Since A and E were marked as present only once, and in the wrong positions, we assume that at least one A and one E are present. But there could be duplicates? We don\'t know. But for the next guess, let\'s assume no duplicates to maximize coverage.\n\n Also, we want to test other vowels or common consonants.\n\n Common letters we haven\'t tried: S, T, L, P, etc.\n\n Let me think of words that have A and E, and don\'t have C, R, N.\n\n Example: ""LATER"", ""SLATE"", ""LEAST"", etc.\n\n However, note:\n   In ""crane"", the A was at position 3 and E at position 5. So we must move them.\n\n How about a word where A is at position 1? Then E cannot be at position 5? But E can be anywhere except 5? Actually, we know for the first guess that E was at position 5 and was wrong. That does not prevent E from being at position 5 in the actual word? Wait, no: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. Therefore, E cannot be at position 5. Similarly, A was at position 3 and was marked as present but wrong position, so A cannot be at position 3.\n\n Therefore:\n   Positions where A can be: 1, 2, 4\n   Positions where E can be: 1, 2, 3, 4\n\n Also, the word does not contain C, R, N.\n\n Let me pick a word that uses common letters and places A and E in new positions.\n\n Consider ""SLATE"":\n   S at position 1, L at 2, A at 3? Wait, but we know A cannot be at position 3? Because the feedback for the first guess said A was at position 3 and was wrong? Actually, no: the first guess had A at position 3 and we were told it\'s not there. So in ""SLATE"", putting A at position 3 is the same position? That would still be wrong? But we want to test A at a new position.\n\n Alternatively, ""LEAST"":\n   L at 1, E at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 for A? Not allowed? Actually, we can try A at a new position? But we know that A is not at position 3? So if we put A at position 3 again, and the word has A, it would still be marked as ""-"" because it\'s at the same wrong position? Then we won\'t get new information? Better to move it.\n\n So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.\n\n How about ""PLATE"":\n   P at 1, L at 2, A at 3? Again position 3? Let me avoid.\n\n How about ""TALES"":\n   T at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, S at 5 -> this puts A at 2 (which is different from 3) and E at 4 (different from 5). Also, avoids positions that we know are incorrect.\n\n Also, note: in ""crane"", position 1: C (not in word) -> so we can replace C with T or S, etc.\n\n Let me write the word: TALES\n But does it use any forbidden letters? C, R, N -> no. So it\'s okay.\n\n How about ""STALE""?\n   S at 1, T at 2, A at 3? Again position 3 -> we don\'t want that if we can avoid.\n\n How about ""STEAL""?\n   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5 -> this puts E at position 3 and A at position 4 (both new positions). And E is not at 5? And A not at 3? Actually, E at 3? We don\'t know if position 3 is available for E? We know E is not at 5, but it can be at 3? Yes, because we\'ve never tested it at 3? Actually, we tested E at position 5 and it was wrong, but not at 3? So that\'s new.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that uses A at position 1 and E at position 2? For example, ""ADIEU""? But ADIEU has D and I, and also E is at position 4? Actually:\n   ""ADIEU"": A at 1, D at 2, I at 3, E at 4, U at 5 -> and E is at 4? But we also noted we haven\'t tested U? It\'s a vowel but not super common.\n\n However, ""STEAL"" seems better because it uses more common letters? But note that we have to avoid R, C, N. And we include S, T, E, A, L.\n\n Also, ""STEAL"" might help us if we get feedback on S, T, L.\n\n Another candidate: ""SLATE"" with A at position 3? We know A cannot be at position 3? So we shouldn\'t put it at 3 again? Because then we already know that if A is in the word, it\'s not at 3. Therefore, putting it at 3 again would still be wrong? And we don\'t learn anything? Actually, we might: if we put A at 3 again and we get a ""-"", that tells us that indeed it\'s in the word? Wait, we already know that. So we don\'t get new information on the position.\n\n Hence, we should try A at a position we haven\'t tested. Similarly for E.\n\n So let me avoid position 3 for A and position 5 for E.\n\n How about ""STALE""? That has A at 3 -> avoid.\n How about ""SLATE"" with A at 3 -> avoid.\n\n Alternatively, ""LEAFS"" (if valid): L at 1, E at 2, A at 3 -> again position 3? Avoid.\n\n How about ""ADIEU""? \n   A: position 1 -> new position for A (since only tested at 3 before) -> good.\n   E: position 4 -> new position (since tested only at 5) -> good.\n   Also, we get to test D, I, U.\n\n However, U is less common? And we might want more common letters.\n\n How about ""PASTE""?\n   P at 1, A at 2, S at 3, T at 4, E at 5 -> but we know E cannot be at 5? So if we put E at 5, and the word has E, then we expect a ""-"" for E? But that\'s the same as before? So we don\'t learn if E can be at 5? Actually, we know already that E is not at 5? Then it must be elsewhere? Therefore, putting E at 5 again is futile? Because we already know it\'s not there? And we get a ""-"" if E is in the word? But that doesn\'t tell us where it might be? So we waste that slot.\n\n Therefore, we want E at a position that is not 5? And A at a position that is not 3? So ""PASTE"" has A at 2? That\'s a new position? But E at 5? We should avoid.\n\n How about ""STEAK"": \n   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, K at 5 -> this avoids A at 3? And E not at 5? Actually E is at 3? A at 4? Both new positions? And K is a common consonant.\n\n But note: we must avoid letters C, R, N -> and ""STEAK"" does not have them.\n\n So yes.\n\n Alternatively, ""STEAM"": \n   S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, M at 5 -> same issue? E at 3? Then we might get new information? And we test M at 5? But M hasn\'t been tested? And E at position 3 is new? Because first guess we only had E at 5? So we don\'t know about position 3? Correct.\n\n However, note that the word does not have R, C, N? Both STEAM and STEAK are acceptable.\n\n But STEAM has M? We haven\'t tested M? So we can learn something.\n\n How about ""PLANE""? But it has N? Which we know is not in the word? But wait: first feedback says N is not in the word? So we shouldn\'t use N.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid N? So ""PLANE"" is invalid.\n\n Let me decide: I think ""TALES"" is a good candidate? \n   T at 1? We haven\'t tested position 1? \n   A at 2? New? \n   L at 3? \n   E at 4? New? \n   S at 5?\n\n But note: in the feedback, we don\'t know anything about position 1? Only that C was there and is wrong? So we can put T there? And since T is a common starting letter.\n\n Also, ""TALES"" contains:\n   T: not tested before? \n   A: present, at position 2? \n   L: not tested? \n   E: present, at position 4? \n   S: not tested?\n\n We avoid C, R, N? Yes.\n\n But what if we get: A at position 2? What if the actual A is not at 2? Then we get ""A"" as ""-""? But we already know A is present? Then we know it\'s not at 2? Similarly for E? Then we get information? Actually, we would know that A is not at 2? And E not at 4? Then we can narrow down.\n\n Alternatively, we can maximize coverage: we have A and E to be placed in positions that are new? And three new letters: T, L, S.\n\n Also, we can consider: if the word has A at position 1, then we are not testing that? So maybe we can try including position 1? But we have T at 1? So if we get a ✓ on T? Then we know? Or if we get a ""-""? Then we know T is in the word? Etc.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""SLATE"" but move A? We can\'t? Because we can\'t control? Or can we? We have to choose a word? How about ""SALET"" (if valid)? \n   S at 1, A at 2, L at 3, E at 4, T at 5 -> similar to TALES? And A at 2, E at 4.\n\n But SALET is a word? Yes, it\'s an old term for a helmet? But accepted in Wordle? Depends? But I think it is.\n\n However, TALES is more common.\n\n Another word: ""TEALS"" — teal is a color, plural? TEALS? Might not be accepted? So stick to TALES?\n\n But let me confirm: TALES is valid.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""TALES"".\n\n However, note: we have two words: TALES and STEAL? Which one? \n   STEAL: S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, A at 4, L at 5? Then A is at 4? And E at 3? Both new? So why not STEAL?\n\n Actually, STEAL is a very common word. Also, S, T, E, A, L — same letters? Just arranged differently.\n\n But in STEAL: S at 1, T at 2? Which we haven\'t tested? And E at 3 (new position), A at 4 (new), L at 5? \n We also avoid C, R, N? Yes.\n\n The advantage of STEAL: \n   Position 1: we test S? Which is a very common letter? And T next? \n   And A we get to put at 4? And E at 3? \n\n But note: we already know A is present? So if we put A at 4? And if it\'s the correct location? We get a ✓? Or if it\'s not? Then we know it\'s elsewhere? Similarly for E? \n\n Also, we get to test L at position 5? Which hasn\'t been tested? \n\n How about compared to TALES? \n   TALES: position 1 is T? Then A at 2? Then E at 4? L at 3? S at 5? \n\n Both arrangements are good? \n\n But in the first guess, we tested letter E at position 5? And got ""-""? So if we put L at position 5? How do we know? We don\'t? But we\'ll test it? \n\n Alternatively: the word has exactly 5 letters? And we know two: A and E? So three unknown? \n\n Both STEAL and TALES test three new letters? So same? \n\n How about frequency? \n   S is very common? T too? L less than S? So STEAL might be better because S is at the beginning? \n\n But note: in the first guess, we didn\'t have S or T? So we are testing high-frequency letters? \n\n However, STEAL has S and T at positions 1 and 2? Both common? \n\n Also, STEAL the word is standard? \n\n I\'ll choose STEAL? But wait: in STEAL, E is at position 3? We don\'t know? But in the actual word? We don\'t know? So it\'s good.\n\n But note: we must be able to interpret? \n\n Alternatively, let\'s pick a word that doesn\'t put E at the end? Because we know it\'s not at the end? So any position that is not end? Well, we put E at 3? That\'s in the middle? So safe.\n\n Similarly, we put A at position 4? Not at 3? So safe.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll go with ""STEAL"".\n\n But let me double-check: STEAL? \n   S, T, E, A, L -> letters: S, T, E, A, L -> excludes C, R, N? Yes.\n\n So I\'ll use STEAL.\n\n<guess>steal</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C not present, R not present, A present but not at position 3, N not present, E present but not at position 5), the new guess should:\n- Include A and E (confirmed present)\n- Avoid C, R, N (confirmed absent)\n- Place A in a new position (not 3) and E in a new position (not 5) to test different locations\n- Incorporate common unverified letters like S, T, and L to maximize information\n\n""STEAL"" meets these criteria:\n- S, T, E, A, L avoids C/R/N\n- Places A at position 4 (new)\n- Places E at position 3 (new)\n- Tests high-frequency consonants S, T, and L\n- Valid 5-letter English word\n\n<guess>steal</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: steal -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n  - C, R, N are not in the word.\n  - A is in the word but not at position 3.\n  - E is in the word but not at position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""steal"" -> S(✓) T(✓) E(✓) A(✓) L(x)\nMeaning:\n  - S is in the word and at the correct position (position 1).\n  - T is in the word and at the correct position (position 2).\n  - E is in the word and at the correct position (position 3).\n  - A is in the word and at the correct position (position 4).\n  - L is not in the word.\n\nSo, from the second guess, we know:\n  - The word starts with ""S"" and the second letter is ""T"", the third is ""E"", and the fourth is ""A"". \n  - The word is S T E A _ \n  - The last letter is missing, and we know it\'s not L (and also not C, R, N from the first guess).\n\nAdditionally, we know that the word does not contain: C, R, N, L.\n\nWe also know from the first guess that E is not at position 5 (but now we have it at position 3, which is correct) and A is not at position 3 (now at position 4, which is correct). So that is consistent.\n\nNow, we need to find a 5-letter word that starts with ""STEA"" and the last letter is not C, R, N, L.\n\nWhat are the possible last letters? We need to consider common English letters that are not in the exclusion list.\n\nExclusion list: C, R, N, L.\n\nPossible letters for the last position: any letter except C, R, N, L, and also we must consider that the word must be valid.\n\nCommon words that start with ""STEA"":\n- STEAD\n- STEAK\n- STEAL (but we tried and L is not in the word, so not this)\n- STEAM\n- STEAR (but R is excluded, so not)\n- STEAN?

We can try one of these.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can try to get it in one shot? But we don\'t know which one.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that tests multiple possibilities? But we already have 4 letters fixed: S, T, E, A. So we only need to find the last letter.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that tests multiple last letters? Because we can only test one word.\n\nSo we have to guess one of the possibilities.\n\nLet\'s list the possibilities again:\n\n- STEAD: D at the end\n- STEAK: K at the end\n- STEAM: M at the end\n- STEA? any others? \n  - STEA? STEAN? not a word.\n  - STEAR? not allowed because R is excluded.\n  - STEAX? not a word.\n  - STEAB? not a word.\n\nSo only STEAD, STEAK, STEAM.\n\nWe can try one of these. How to choose? We can consider frequency.\n\nIn English, ""STEAM"" is very common, as is ""STEAK"". ""STEAD"" is less common? But we don\'t know.\n\nAlternatively, we can look at the feedback: we have no information about D, K, M? So we have to guess.\n\nBut note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to guess one and if wrong, then the next.\n\nBut we can also think: in the first guess, we had E at position 5 and it was wrong? But now we have E at position 3? So that doesn\'t help.\n\nAnother idea: we can use a word that has the same structure? But we don\'t have to, because we have 4 letters fixed.\n\nSo I think we should just pick one. Let\'s pick ""STEAM"" because it\'s common.\n\nBut wait: we have to make sure that M is not excluded? We haven\'t tested M? And it\'s not in the exclusion list? So it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, D and K are not excluded.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""STEAM"".\n\nBut note: the feedback for the second guess said L is not in the word? So we avoid L? And we are avoiding C, R, N? So STEAM is safe.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""STEAM"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  Position 1: S (correct) -> we know it\'s S\n  Position 2: T (correct) -> we know it\'s T\n  Position 3: E (correct) -> we know it\'s E\n  Position 4: A (correct) -> we know it\'s A\n  Position 5: M (to be tested)\n\nIf it\'s correct, we win. If not, then we know it\'s either D or K? Then we can try STEAD or STEAK next.\n\nBut we are on the third guess? So we have three more guesses? So it\'s safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that doesn\'t use the known positions? But that would be inefficient? Because we already have 4 letters fixed? Why not use that?\n\nSo I think ""STEAM"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""STEAM"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**: A and E are in the word but not at positions 3 or 5.

We are given the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
  Interpretation: 
    - C, R, N are not in the word.
    - A is in the word but not in position 3.
    - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: steal -> Feedback: S(✓), T(✓), E(✓), A(✓), L(x)
  Interpretation:
    - S is in the word and in position 1.
    - T is in the word and in position 2.
    - E is in the word and in position 3.
    - A is in the word and in position 4.
    - L is not in the word.

Therefore, after guess 2, we know the word has the first four letters as: S, T, E, A. So the word is ""STEA_"".

Guess 3: steam -> Feedback: S(✓), T(✓), E(✓), A(✓), M(x)
  Interpretation:
    - The first four letters are confirmed: S, T, E, A in positions 1-4.
    - M is not in the word.

Guess 4: stead -> Feedback: S(✓), T(✓), E(✓), A(✓), D(x)
  Interpretation:
    - The first four letters are confirmed: S, T, E, A in positions 1-4.
    - D is not in the word.

So from all the feedback, we know:
- The word is ""STEA"" + one last letter.
- The last letter must be a letter that has not been excluded.
- Excluded letters from all guesses: C, R, N, L, M, D (all marked as 'x').

Therefore, the last letter cannot be C, R, N, L, M, or D.

We must now guess the last letter. The word ""STEA_"" must be a valid English word.

Common possibilities for words starting with ""STEA"" that are 5 letters and end with a letter not excluded:
- STEAK (ends with K) - K has not been excluded.
- Other possibilities? 
  - We have tried STEAL (L excluded), STEAM (M excluded), STEAD (D excluded).
  - STEAR? But R is excluded (from Guess 1: R(x)).
  - STEA? No other common words.

Therefore, the only common word remaining is ""STEAK"".

We know:
- K has not been used or excluded in any of the feedback so far? 
  - In Guess 1: letters are C,R,A,N,E -> no K.
  - Guess 2: S,T,E,A,L -> no K.
  - Guess 3: S,T,E,A,M -> no K.
  - Guess 4: S,T,E,A,D -> no K.

So K is a possibility.

Thus, the next guess must be ""STEAK"".

If this is correct, we should get all checks.

So I will guess ""STEAK"".Based on cumulative feedback:

- **Final known pattern**: The word is ""STEA_"" (positions 1–4 are S, T, E, A).
- **Excluded letters for position 5**: C, R, N, L, M, D (from all prior feedback).
- **Only remaining common English word**: ""STEAK"" (with K).

Thus, the guess is clear: ""STEAK"".

<guess>steak</guess>
</think>
The feedback from all guesses reveals:
- **Positions 1-4 confirmed as S, T, E, A** (from ""steal"" and subsequent guesses).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, N (from ""crane""), L (from ""steal""), M (from ""steam""), D (from ""stead"").
- **Possible words**: Only ""STEAK"" remains, as ""K"" is the only common English letter for position 5 not excluded.

### Next Guess: 
""STEAK"" tests if ""K"" completes the word. If correct, all positions will match.

<guess>steak</guess>",steak,"We are given the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(x), E(-)
  Interpretation: 
    - C, R, N are not in the word.
    - A is in the word but not in position 3.
    - E is in the word but not in position 5.

Guess 2: steal -> Feedback: S(✓), T(✓), E(✓), A(✓), L(x)
  Interpretation:
    - S is in the word and in position 1.
    - T is in the word and in position 2.
    - E is in the word and in position 3.
    - A is in the word and in position 4.
    - L is not in the word.

Therefore, after guess 2, we know the word has the first four letters as: S, T, E, A. So the word is ""STEA_"".

Guess 3: steam -> Feedback: S(✓), T(✓), E(✓), A(✓), M(x)
  Interpretation:
    - The first four letters are confirmed: S, T, E, A in positions 1-4.
    - M is not in the word.

Guess 4: stead -> Feedback: S(✓), T(✓), E(✓), A(✓), D(x)
  Interpretation:
    - The first four letters are confirmed: S, T, E, A in positions 1-4.
    - D is not in the word.

So from all the feedback, we know:
- The word is ""STEA"" + one last letter.
- The last letter must be a letter that has not been excluded.
- Excluded letters from all guesses: C, R, N, L, M, D (all marked as 'x').

Therefore, the last letter cannot be C, R, N, L, M, or D.

We must now guess the last letter. The word ""STEA_"" must be a valid English word.

Common possibilities for words starting with ""STEA"" that are 5 letters and end with a letter not excluded:
- STEAK (ends with K) - K has not been excluded.
- Other possibilities? 
  - We have tried STEAL (L excluded), STEAM (M excluded), STEAD (D excluded).
  - STEAR? But R is excluded (from Guess 1: R(x)).
  - STEA? No other common words.

Therefore, the only common word remaining is ""STEAK"".

We know:
- K has not been used or excluded in any of the feedback so far? 
  - In Guess 1: letters are C,R,A,N,E -> no K.
  - Guess 2: S,T,E,A,L -> no K.
  - Guess 3: S,T,E,A,M -> no K.
  - Guess 4: S,T,E,A,D -> no K.

So K is a possibility.

Thus, the next guess must be ""STEAK"".

If this is correct, we should get all checks.

So I will guess ""STEAK"".Based on cumulative feedback:

- **Final known pattern**: The word is ""STEA_"" (positions 1–4 are S, T, E, A).
- **Excluded letters for position 5**: C, R, N, L, M, D (from all prior feedback).
- **Only remaining common English word**: ""STEAK"" (with K).

Thus, the guess is clear: ""STEAK"".
