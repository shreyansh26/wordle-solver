We are making the first guess. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word with good coverage of common letters.
 A common strategy is to use a word that includes frequent consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained.
 Some good starting words are those with common letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, and also A and O.

 Let me consider words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc. I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it covers S, L, A, T, E which are common letters.

 However, note that the example given used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but as we are starting, we can choose any valid word.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also a popular starter? But let's see:

 - ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E.
 - ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.

 Both are good. Let me pick ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

I'm starting my first guess without any prior feedback. I need to choose a word that maximizes the information I gain about the secret word. A good opening word should:
- Contain common vowels and consonants to test frequently used letters
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more ground
- Have letters that often appear together in English words

I'll use ""CRANE"" because it:
- Includes three common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N)
- Covers diverse letter positions that frequently appear at different spots in 5-letter words
- Has no duplicate letters, maximizing information per guess

We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

This tells us:
- R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed (positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively).
- C and N are not in the secret word at all.

So the secret word contains R, A, E, and does not contain C or N.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2 (the second letter), and A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.

We have 6 letters that are out: C, N (and by extension, we know R, A, E are in).

For the next guess, we should:
1. Include R, A, E (since we know they are in the word) but place them in different positions than before.
2. Avoid using C and N again.
3. Use other common letters to test new possibilities.

In the first guess, the positions were:
- Position 1: C (x) -> secret word does not start with C? Not necessarily, but C is not in the word at all.
- Position 2: R (-) -> R is in the word but not at position 2.
- Position 3: A (-) -> A is in the word but not at position 3.
- Position 4: N (x) -> N is not in word.
- Position 5: E (-) -> E is in the word but not at position 5.

So for our second guess, we need to:
- Place R in a position other than 2 (so 1,3,4,or5)
- Place A in a position other than 3 (so 1,2,4,or5)
- Place E in a position other than 5 (so 1,2,3,or4)
- And include two new letters (since there are two more letters to find).

The word must be 5 letters, with R, A, E, and two other letters that are not C or N (and not any other letter we know is out, but currently only C and N are out).

We also want to test common letters. Since we know the secret word has R, A, E, and two more letters.

Possible new letters: for example, S, T, L, O, U, etc.

We can choose a word that contains R, A, E and two other letters.

Let's list some candidate words that include R, A, E and avoid C and N.

Examples: 
- ""LATER"": This has L, A, T, E, R -> contains A, E, R.
  Positions: L at1, A at2, T at3, E at4, R at5.
  But in the feedback, we know:
    R was not at position 2, but now we are putting R at position 5 -> okay?
    A was not at position 3, but here A is at position 2 -> okay? We don't know if position 2 is allowed for A, since it was only excluded at position 3.
  Similarly, E was not at position 5, but now at position 4 -> okay.

But we also need to see if the new placements fit the constraints.

Constraints from feedback:
- R cannot be at position 2 -> in LATER, R is at 5, which is fine.
- A cannot be at position 3 -> in LATER, A is at position 2, which is not 3, so fine.
- E cannot be at position 5 -> in LATER, E is at position 4, which is not 5, fine.

So ""LATER"" seems okay.

Another option: ""IRATE"" -> I, R, A, T, E. This also includes I and T.

But note, we only have information about C and N being out. I might be in or not.

However, we want to maximize information. In ""LATER"", we use L and T as new letters.

Similarly, other words: ""RATED"" has R, A, T, E, D. But D is less common? Also, we need to avoid N and C.

But in ""LATER"", we are not repeating previous positions improperly? 

Wait, position 2 in the first guess was R (but wrong). Now if we put R at position 1? Like ""RAISE"" but that has S, but E at the end which was disallowed? E cannot be at position 5.

""RAISE"" has E at position 5 -> which we know E is not at position 5 from the feedback. So we cannot use words that put E at position 5.

Similarly, A cannot be at position 3.

In ""RAISE"": R at1, A at2, I at3, S at4, E at5 -> but E is at position 5, which is disallowed. So we must avoid E at position 5 in this guess.

Therefore, a word like ""RAISE"" is invalid because it puts E at position 5.

Similarly, ""ADORE"" -> A at1, D at2, O at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5 disallowed.

So words that end with E are not allowed for this guess.

Back to ""LATER"": L at1, A at2, T at3, E at4, R at5 -> 
- R is now at position 5 (previously at position 2, which now is not 2, okay)
- A is at position 2 (previously was at position 3; now moved to position 2, which hasn't been tested before? Previously position 3 was incorrect, but position 2 wasn't tested for A? We don't know about position 2 for A yet. The feedback only said position 3 for A was wrong, so other positions are allowed.)
- E is at position 4 (previously at position 5 which was wrong; now position 4 is new)

This seems valid.

Another word: ""TARES"" -> T, A, R, E, S. Positions: T at1, A at2, R at3, E at4, S at5.
- R at position 3 (was position 2 in previous guess, and we know it is not at position 2, but position 3 might be okay? But we haven't tested position 3 for R before? The feedback for R was that it was in the word but not at position 2, so it could be at positions 1,3,4, or5.
Here, putting R at position 3 is allowed.

Similarly, A at position 2 (not position 3), E at position 4 (not position 5). And S is a new letter.

Also, ""PARSE"" -> P, A, R, S, E. Positions: P at1, A at2, R at3, S at4, E at5 -> E at position 5 is disallowed. Not good.

""STARE"" -> S, T, A, R, E. Positions: S at1, T at2, A at3, R at4, E at5 -> Oh, E at position 5 disallowed. And A at position 3? The feedback said A is not at position 3, so putting A at position 3 would be invalid? No: the feedback indicates that A cannot be at position 3 because in the first guess it was at position 3 but was the correct letter in the wrong position? Actually, the ""-"" means the letter is in the word but not at that position, so we cannot put A at position 3 in subsequent guesses because we know it's not position 3.

So in ""STARE"", A is at position 3 which is known to be incorrect position, so that would be invalid for A? Actually, the rules: we can put A at position 3 again? But we already know that A is not at position 3 in the secret word. So putting A at position 3 in a guess would be a waste because we know it's not there. But is it allowed? Yes, but it wouldn't give new information and might violate the spirit of the game? Actually, the game allows any guess as long as it's a valid word.

However, we want to maximize information, so we should avoid positions that are known wrong. So we should not put A at position 3 because we know it's not in that position.

Similarly, we should not put E at position 5, and not put R at position 2.

For ""STARE"":
- A is at position 3 (which is excluded) -> we would get a ""-"" for A regardless? Actually, no: if the secret word has A, but not at position 3, then A at position 3 would give ""-"" meaning it's in the word but wrong position. But we already know that A is in the word and not at position 3. So guessing A at position 3 again would confirm it's not there, but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information. We should avoid it.

Therefore, ""STARE"" has A at position 3 and E at position 5 -> both disallowed? Positions: avoid E at 5 and A at 3.

Similarly, in ""TARES"":
- Position: T1, A2, R3, E4, S5 -> avoids the previous bad positions? A is at position 2 (not 3), E at position 4 (not 5), R at position 3 (not position 2). Also, S at position 5 is new.

Another word: ""ALERT"" -> A, L, E, R, T. Positions: A at1, L at2, E at3, R at4, T at5.
- A at position 1 (not 3) -> ok
- E at position 3 (not 5) -> ok
- R at position 4 (not 2) -> ok

So ""ALERT"" is also good.

But ""ALERT"" has E at position 3 and R at position 4.

Now, comparing ""LATER"" and ""TARES"" and ""ALERT"":

I think ""LATER"" and ""TARES"" are both valid. ""LATER"" includes L and T; ""TARES"" includes T and S.

S is a very common letter, so I'll consider ""TARES"".

With ""TARES"", we can test T, A, R, E, S, where A and T are new positions? For A, position 2 is tested; T at position 1; S at position 5.

Also, we know from feedback that the secret word does not have letters at:
- position 1: C (but C is out, so not)
- position 4: N (but N is out)

So we can try ""TARES"".

Alternatively, to preserve more common letters, but I'll choose ""TARES"" to test S.

Another word: ""ARISE"" but E at position 5 -> invalid.

So let's settle on ""TARES"".

I think ""TARES"" is good.

So second guess: TARES
</think>
<step>
Based on the feedback from Guess 1 with ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: - (in the secret word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the secret word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the secret word)
- E: - (in the secret word, but not in position 5)

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains R, A, and E, but not C or N.
2. R cannot be in position 2 (since it was wrong there), A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.
3. For the new guess:
   - Must include R, A, and E to confirm their positions, placed differently from before (R not at position 2, A not at position 3, E not at position 5).
   - Must exclude C and N.
   - Should introduce two new letters to test for the remaining unknown letters in the secret word.
   - Focus on common English letters (e.g., S, T, L, etc.) to maximize information.

Considering these constraints, I evaluated several candidate words:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- R, A, E must be repositioned: R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5; A in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5; E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Potential words: ""TARES"" (positions: T1, A2, R3, E4, S5) fits all constraints.
- Why ""TARES""? 
  - Includes R (position 3), A (position 2—not tested before), E (position 4—not position 5).
  - Excludes C and N.
  - Tests new letters: T (common) and S (very common).
  - A at position 2 and E at position 4 are both allowed based on prior feedback.
</step>

<guess>TARES</guess>",TARES,"We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

This tells us:
- R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed (positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively).
- C and N are not in the secret word at all.

So the secret word contains R, A, E, and does not contain C or N.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2 (the second letter), and A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.

We have 6 letters that are out: C, N (and by extension, we know R, A, E are in).

For the next guess, we should:
1. Include R, A, E (since we know they are in the word) but place them in different positions than before.
2. Avoid using C and N again.
3. Use other common letters to test new possibilities.

In the first guess, the positions were:
- Position 1: C (x) -> secret word does not start with C? Not necessarily, but C is not in the word at all.
- Position 2: R (-) -> R is in the word but not at position 2.
- Position 3: A (-) -> A is in the word but not at position 3.
- Position 4: N (x) -> N is not in word.
- Position 5: E (-) -> E is in the word but not at position 5.

So for our second guess, we need to:
- Place R in a position other than 2 (so 1,3,4,or5)
- Place A in a position other than 3 (so 1,2,4,or5)
- Place E in a position other than 5 (so 1,2,3,or4)
- And include two new letters (since there are two more letters to find).

The word must be 5 letters, with R, A, E, and two other letters that are not C or N (and not any other letter we know is out, but currently only C and N are out).

We also want to test common letters. Since we know the secret word has R, A, E, and two more letters.

Possible new letters: for example, S, T, L, O, U, etc.

We can choose a word that contains R, A, E and two other letters.

Let's list some candidate words that include R, A, E and avoid C and N.

Examples: 
- ""LATER"": This has L, A, T, E, R -> contains A, E, R.
  Positions: L at1, A at2, T at3, E at4, R at5.
  But in the feedback, we know:
    R was not at position 2, but now we are putting R at position 5 -> okay?
    A was not at position 3, but here A is at position 2 -> okay? We don't know if position 2 is allowed for A, since it was only excluded at position 3.
  Similarly, E was not at position 5, but now at position 4 -> okay.

But we also need to see if the new placements fit the constraints.

Constraints from feedback:
- R cannot be at position 2 -> in LATER, R is at 5, which is fine.
- A cannot be at position 3 -> in LATER, A is at position 2, which is not 3, so fine.
- E cannot be at position 5 -> in LATER, E is at position 4, which is not 5, fine.

So ""LATER"" seems okay.

Another option: ""IRATE"" -> I, R, A, T, E. This also includes I and T.

But note, we only have information about C and N being out. I might be in or not.

However, we want to maximize information. In ""LATER"", we use L and T as new letters.

Similarly, other words: ""RATED"" has R, A, T, E, D. But D is less common? Also, we need to avoid N and C.

But in ""LATER"", we are not repeating previous positions improperly? 

Wait, position 2 in the first guess was R (but wrong). Now if we put R at position 1? Like ""RAISE"" but that has S, but E at the end which was disallowed? E cannot be at position 5.

""RAISE"" has E at position 5 -> which we know E is not at position 5 from the feedback. So we cannot use words that put E at position 5.

Similarly, A cannot be at position 3.

In ""RAISE"": R at1, A at2, I at3, S at4, E at5 -> but E is at position 5, which is disallowed. So we must avoid E at position 5 in this guess.

Therefore, a word like ""RAISE"" is invalid because it puts E at position 5.

Similarly, ""ADORE"" -> A at1, D at2, O at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5 disallowed.

So words that end with E are not allowed for this guess.

Back to ""LATER"": L at1, A at2, T at3, E at4, R at5 -> 
- R is now at position 5 (previously at position 2, which now is not 2, okay)
- A is at position 2 (previously was at position 3; now moved to position 2, which hasn't been tested before? Previously position 3 was incorrect, but position 2 wasn't tested for A? We don't know about position 2 for A yet. The feedback only said position 3 for A was wrong, so other positions are allowed.)
- E is at position 4 (previously at position 5 which was wrong; now position 4 is new)

This seems valid.

Another word: ""TARES"" -> T, A, R, E, S. Positions: T at1, A at2, R at3, E at4, S at5.
- R at position 3 (was position 2 in previous guess, and we know it is not at position 2, but position 3 might be okay? But we haven't tested position 3 for R before? The feedback for R was that it was in the word but not at position 2, so it could be at positions 1,3,4, or5.
Here, putting R at position 3 is allowed.

Similarly, A at position 2 (not position 3), E at position 4 (not position 5). And S is a new letter.

Also, ""PARSE"" -> P, A, R, S, E. Positions: P at1, A at2, R at3, S at4, E at5 -> E at position 5 is disallowed. Not good.

""STARE"" -> S, T, A, R, E. Positions: S at1, T at2, A at3, R at4, E at5 -> Oh, E at position 5 disallowed. And A at position 3? The feedback said A is not at position 3, so putting A at position 3 would be invalid? No: the feedback indicates that A cannot be at position 3 because in the first guess it was at position 3 but was the correct letter in the wrong position? Actually, the ""-"" means the letter is in the word but not at that position, so we cannot put A at position 3 in subsequent guesses because we know it's not position 3.

So in ""STARE"", A is at position 3 which is known to be incorrect position, so that would be invalid for A? Actually, the rules: we can put A at position 3 again? But we already know that A is not at position 3 in the secret word. So putting A at position 3 in a guess would be a waste because we know it's not there. But is it allowed? Yes, but it wouldn't give new information and might violate the spirit of the game? Actually, the game allows any guess as long as it's a valid word.

However, we want to maximize information, so we should avoid positions that are known wrong. So we should not put A at position 3 because we know it's not in that position.

Similarly, we should not put E at position 5, and not put R at position 2.

For ""STARE"":
- A is at position 3 (which is excluded) -> we would get a ""-"" for A regardless? Actually, no: if the secret word has A, but not at position 3, then A at position 3 would give ""-"" meaning it's in the word but wrong position. But we already know that A is in the word and not at position 3. So guessing A at position 3 again would confirm it's not there, but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information. We should avoid it.

Therefore, ""STARE"" has A at position 3 and E at position 5 -> both disallowed? Positions: avoid E at 5 and A at 3.

Similarly, in ""TARES"":
- Position: T1, A2, R3, E4, S5 -> avoids the previous bad positions? A is at position 2 (not 3), E at position 4 (not 5), R at position 3 (not position 2). Also, S at position 5 is new.

Another word: ""ALERT"" -> A, L, E, R, T. Positions: A at1, L at2, E at3, R at4, T at5.
- A at position 1 (not 3) -> ok
- E at position 3 (not 5) -> ok
- R at position 4 (not 2) -> ok

So ""ALERT"" is also good.

But ""ALERT"" has E at position 3 and R at position 4.

Now, comparing ""LATER"" and ""TARES"" and ""ALERT"":

I think ""LATER"" and ""TARES"" are both valid. ""LATER"" includes L and T; ""TARES"" includes T and S.

S is a very common letter, so I'll consider ""TARES"".

With ""TARES"", we can test T, A, R, E, S, where A and T are new positions? For A, position 2 is tested; T at position 1; S at position 5.

Also, we know from feedback that the secret word does not have letters at:
- position 1: C (but C is out, so not)
- position 4: N (but N is out)

So we can try ""TARES"".

Alternatively, to preserve more common letters, but I'll choose ""TARES"" to test S.

Another word: ""ARISE"" but E at position 5 -> invalid.

So let's settle on ""TARES"".

I think ""TARES"" is good.

So second guess: TARES<step>
Based on the feedback from Guess 1 with ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: - (in the secret word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the secret word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the secret word)
- E: - (in the secret word, but not in position 5)

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains R, A, and E, but not C or N.
2. R cannot be in position 2 (since it was wrong there), A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.
3. For the new guess:
   - Must include R, A, and E to confirm their positions, placed differently from before (R not at position 2, A not at position 3, E not at position 5).
   - Must exclude C and N.
   - Should introduce two new letters to test for the remaining unknown letters in the secret word.
   - Focus on common English letters (e.g., S, T, L, etc.) to maximize information.

Considering these constraints, I evaluated several candidate words:
- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.
- R, A, E must be repositioned: R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5; A in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5; E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Potential words: ""TARES"" (positions: T1, A2, R3, E4, S5) fits all constraints.
- Why ""TARES""? 
  - Includes R (position 3), A (position 2—not tested before), E (position 4—not position 5).
  - Excludes C and N.
  - Tests new letters: T (common) and S (very common).
  - A at position 2 and E at position 4 are both allowed based on prior feedback.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,taper,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a word with good coverage of common letters.
 A common strategy is to use a word that includes frequent consonants and vowels to maximize the information gained.
 Some good starting words are those with common letters like R, S, T, L, N, E, and also A and O.

 Let me consider words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROATE"", etc. I'll choose ""SLATE"" because it covers S, L, A, T, E which are common letters.

 However, note that the example given used ""STORM"" and ""BRAVE"", but as we are starting, we can choose any valid word.

 Alternatively, ""CRANE"" is also a popular starter? But let's see:

 - ""CRANE"" has C, R, A, N, E.
 - ""SLATE"" has S, L, A, T, E.

 Both are good. Let me pick ""CRANE"" for this first guess.

 So, my first guess will be: CRANEI'm starting my first guess without any prior feedback. I need to choose a word that maximizes the information I gain about the secret word. A good opening word should:
- Contain common vowels and consonants to test frequently used letters
- Avoid repeating letters to cover more ground
- Have letters that often appear together in English words

I'll use ""CRANE"" because it:
- Includes three common vowels (A, E) and three common consonants (C, R, N)
- Covers diverse letter positions that frequently appear at different spots in 5-letter words
- Has no duplicate letters, maximizing information per guess

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word but wrong position)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

This tells us:
- R, A, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions they were guessed (positions 2, 3, and 5 respectively).
- C and N are not in the secret word at all.

So the secret word contains R, A, E, and does not contain C or N.

Since R is in the word but not in position 2 (the second letter), and A is not in position 3, and E is not in position 5.

We have 6 letters that are out: C, N (and by extension, we know R, A, E are in).

For the next guess, we should:
1. Include R, A, E (since we know they are in the word) but place them in different positions than before.
2. Avoid using C and N again.
3. Use other common letters to test new possibilities.

In the first guess, the positions were:
- Position 1: C (x) -> secret word does not start with C? Not necessarily, but C is not in the word at all.
- Position 2: R (-) -> R is in the word but not at position 2.
- Position 3: A (-) -> A is in the word but not at position 3.
- Position 4: N (x) -> N is not in word.
- Position 5: E (-) -> E is in the word but not at position 5.

So for our second guess, we need to:
- Place R in a position other than 2 (so 1,3,4,or5)
- Place A in a position other than 3 (so 1,2,4,or5)
- Place E in a position other than 5 (so 1,2,3,or4)
- And include two new letters (since there are two more letters to find).

The word must be 5 letters, with R, A, E, and two other letters that are not C or N (and not any other letter we know is out, but currently only C and N are out).

We also want to test common letters. Since we know the secret word has R, A, E, and two more letters.

Possible new letters: for example, S, T, L, O, U, etc.

We can choose a word that contains R, A, E and two other letters.

Let's list some candidate words that include R, A, E and avoid C and N.

Examples: 
- ""LATER"": This has L, A, T, E, R -> contains A, E, R.
  Positions: L at1, A at2, T at3, E at4, R at5.
  But in the feedback, we know:
    R was not at position 2, but now we are putting R at position 5 -> okay?
    A was not at position 3, but here A is at position 2 -> okay? We don't know if position 2 is allowed for A, since it was only excluded at position 3.
  Similarly, E was not at position 5, but now at position 4 -> okay.

But we also need to see if the new placements fit the constraints.

Constraints from feedback:
- R cannot be at position 2 -> in LATER, R is at 5, which is fine.
- A cannot be at position 3 -> in LATER, A is at position 2, which is not 3, so fine.
- E cannot be at position 5 -> in LATER, E is at position 4, which is not 5, fine.

So ""LATER"" seems okay.

Another option: ""IRATE"" -> I, R, A, T, E. This also includes I and T.

But note, we only have information about C and N being out. I might be in or not.

However, we want to maximize information. In ""LATER"", we use L and T as new letters.

Similarly, other words: ""RATED"" has R, A, T, E, D. But D is less common? Also, we need to avoid N and C.

But in ""LATER"", we are not repeating previous positions improperly? 

Wait, position 2 in the first guess was R (but wrong). Now if we put R at position 1? Like ""RAISE"" but that has S, but E at the end which was disallowed? E cannot be at position 5.

""RAISE"" has E at position 5 -> which we know E is not at position 5 from the feedback. So we cannot use words that put E at position 5.

Similarly, A cannot be at position 3.

In ""RAISE"": R at1, A at2, I at3, S at4, E at5 -> but E is at position 5, which is disallowed. So we must avoid E at position 5 in this guess.

Therefore, a word like ""RAISE"" is invalid because it puts E at position 5.

Similarly, ""ADORE"" -> A at1, D at2, O at3, R at4, E at5 -> E at5 disallowed.

So words that end with E are not allowed for this guess.

Back to ""LATER"": L at1, A at2, T at3, E at4, R at5 -> 
- R is now at position 5 (previously at position 2, which now is not 2, okay)
- A is at position 2 (previously was at position 3; now moved to position 2, which hasn't been tested before? Previously position 3 was incorrect, but position 2 wasn't tested for A? We don't know about position 2 for A yet. The feedback only said position 3 for A was wrong, so other positions are allowed.)
- E is at position 4 (previously at position 5 which was wrong; now position 4 is new)

This seems valid.

Another word: ""TARES"" -> T, A, R, E, S. Positions: T at1, A at2, R at3, E at4, S at5.
- R at position 3 (was position 2 in previous guess, and we know it is not at position 2, but position 3 might be okay? But we haven't tested position 3 for R before? The feedback for R was that it was in the word but not at position 2, so it could be at positions 1,3,4, or5.
Here, putting R at position 3 is allowed.

Similarly, A at position 2 (not position 3), E at position 4 (not position 5). And S is a new letter.

Also, ""PARSE"" -> P, A, R, S, E. Positions: P at1, A at2, R at3, S at4, E at5 -> E at position 5 is disallowed. Not good.

""STARE"" -> S, T, A, R, E. Positions: S at1, T at2, A at3, R at4, E at5 -> Oh, E at position 5 disallowed. And A at position 3? The feedback said A is not at position 3, so putting A at position 3 would be invalid? No: the feedback indicates that A cannot be at position 3 because in the first guess it was at position 3 but was the correct letter in the wrong position? Actually, the ""-"" means the letter is in the word but not at that position, so we cannot put A at position 3 in subsequent guesses because we know it's not position 3.

So in ""STARE"", A is at position 3 which is known to be incorrect position, so that would be invalid for A? Actually, the rules: we can put A at position 3 again? But we already know that A is not at position 3 in the secret word. So putting A at position 3 in a guess would be a waste because we know it's not there. But is it allowed? Yes, but it wouldn't give new information and might violate the spirit of the game? Actually, the game allows any guess as long as it's a valid word.

However, we want to maximize information, so we should avoid positions that are known wrong. So we should not put A at position 3 because we know it's not in that position.

Similarly, we should not put E at position 5, and not put R at position 2.

For ""STARE"":
- A is at position 3 (which is excluded) -> we would get a ""-"" for A regardless? Actually, no: if the secret word has A, but not at position 3, then A at position 3 would give ""-"" meaning it's in the word but wrong position. But we already know that A is in the word and not at position 3. So guessing A at position 3 again would confirm it's not there, but we already know that. So it doesn't give new information. We should avoid it.

Therefore, ""STARE"" has A at position 3 and E at position 5 -> both disallowed? Positions: avoid E at 5 and A at 3.

Similarly, in ""TARES"":
- Position: T1, A2, R3, E4, S5 -> avoids the previous bad positions? A is at position 2 (not 3), E at position 4 (not 5), R at position 3 (not position 2). Also, S at position 5 is new.

Another word: ""ALERT"" -> A, L, E, R, T. Positions: A at1, L at2, E at3, R at4, T at5.
- A at position 1 (not 3) -> ok
- E at position 3 (not 5) -> ok
- R at position 4 (not 2) -> ok

So ""ALERT"" is also good.

But ""ALERT"" has E at position 3 and R at position 4.

Now, comparing ""LATER"" and ""TARES"" and ""ALERT"":

I think ""LATER"" and ""TARES"" are both valid. ""LATER"" includes L and T; ""TARES"" includes T and S.

S is a very common letter, so I'll consider ""TARES"".

With ""TARES"", we can test T, A, R, E, S, where A and T are new positions? For A, position 2 is tested; T at position 1; S at position 5.

Also, we know from feedback that the secret word does not have letters at:
- position 1: C (but C is out, so not)
- position 4: N (but N is out)

So we can try ""TARES"".

Alternatively, to preserve more common letters, but I'll choose ""TARES"" to test S.

Another word: ""ARISE"" but E at position 5 -> invalid.

So let's settle on ""TARES"".

I think ""TARES"" is good.

So second guess: TARES<step>
Based on the feedback from Guess 1 with ""CRANE"":
- C: x (not in the secret word)
- R: - (in the secret word, but not in position 2)
- A: - (in the secret word, but not in position 3)
- N: x (not in the secret word)
- E: - (in the secret word, but not in position 5)

Key insights:
1. The secret word contains R, A, and E, but not C or N.
2. R cannot be in position 2 (since it was wrong there), A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.
3. For the new guess:

- Why ""TARES""? 
  - Includes R (position 3), A (position 2—not tested before), E (position 4—not position 5).

So putting A at position 3 in a guess would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. But is it allowed? Yes, but it wouldn\'t give new information and might violate the spirit of the game? Actually, the game allows any guess as long as it\'s a valid word.\n\nHowever, we want to maximize information, so we should avoid positions that are known wrong. So we should not put A at position 3 because we know it\'s not in that position.\n\nSimilarly, we should not put E at position 5, and not put R at position 2.\n\nFor ""STARE"":\n- A is at position 3 (which is excluded) -> we would get a ""-"" for A regardless? Actually, no: if the secret word has A, but not at position 3, then A at position 3 would give ""-"" meaning it\'s in the word but wrong position. But we already know that A is in the word and not at position 3. So guessing A at position 3 again would confirm it\'s not there, but we already know that. So it doesn\'t give new information. We should avoid it.\n\nTherefore, ""STARE"" has A at position 3 and E at position 5 -> both disallowed? Positions: avoid E at 5 and A at 3.\n\nSimilarly, in ""TARES"":\n- Position: T1, A2, R3, E4, S5 -> avoids the previous bad positions? A is at position 2 (not 3), E at position 4 (not 5), R at position 3 (not position 2). Also, S at position 5 is new.\n\nAnother word: ""ALERT"" -> A, L, E, R, T. Positions: A at1, L at2, E at3, R at4, T at5.\n- A at position 1 (not 3) -> ok\n- E at position 3 (not 5) -> ok\n- R at position 4 (not 2) -> ok\n\nSo ""ALERT"" is also good.\n\nBut ""ALERT"" has E at position 3 and R at position 4.\n\nNow, comparing ""LATER"" and ""TARES"" and ""ALERT"":\n\nI think ""LATER"" and ""TARES"" are both valid. ""LATER"" includes L and T; ""TARES"" includes T and S.\n\nS is a very common letter, so I\'ll consider ""TARES"".\n\nWith ""TARES"", we can test T, A, R, E, S, where A and T are new positions? For A, position 2 is tested; T at position 1; S at position 5.\n\nAlso, we know from feedback that the secret word does not have letters at:\n- position 1: C (but C is out, so not)\n- position 4: N (but N is out)\n\nSo we can try ""TARES"".\n\nAlternatively, to preserve more common letters, but I\'ll choose ""TARES"" to test S.\n\nAnother word: ""ARISE"" but E at position 5 -> invalid.\n\nSo let\'s settle on ""TARES"".\n\nI think ""TARES"" is good.\n\nSo second guess: TARES<step>\nBased on the feedback from Guess 1 with ""CRANE"":\n- C: x (not in the secret word)\n- R: - (in the secret word, but not in position 2)\n- A: - (in the secret word, but not in position 3)\n- N: x (not in the secret word)\n- E: - (in the secret word, but not in position 5)\n\nKey insights:\n1. The secret word contains R, A, and E, but not C or N.\n2. R cannot be in position 2 (since it was wrong there), A cannot be in position 3, and E cannot be in position 5.\n3. For the new guess:\n   - Must include R, A, and E to confirm their positions, placed differently from before (R not at position 2, A not at position 3, E not at position 5).\n   - Must exclude C and N.\n   - Should introduce two new letters to test for the remaining unknown letters in the secret word.\n   - Focus on common English letters (e.g., S, T, L, etc.) to maximize information.\n\nConsidering these constraints, I evaluated several candidate words:\n- Must be a valid 5-letter English word.\n- R, A, E must be repositioned: R can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5; A in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5; E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- Potential words: ""TARES"" (positions: T1, A2, R3, E4, S5) fits all constraints.\n- Why ""TARES""? \n  - Includes R (position 3), A (position 2—not tested before), E (position 4—not position 5).\n  - Excludes C and N.\n  - Tests new letters: T (common) and S (very common).\n  - A at position 2 and E at position 4 are both allowed based on prior feedback.\n</step>\n\n<guess>TARES</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: TARES -> FEEDBACK: T(✓) A(✓) R(-) E(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(-), N(x), E(-)
- C and N are not in the word.
- R, A, E are in the word but in the wrong positions: R not at position 2, A not at position 3, E not at position 5.

Guess 2: TARES -> Feedback: T(✓), A(✓), R(-), E(✓), S(x)
- T is correct and in position 1 (since ✓).
- A is correct and in position 2 (✓).
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (because - at position 3) -> so R must be in a different position, which we know from before could be 1, 4, or 5? But position 1 is now T, and positions 4 and 5 are possible. We also had R not at position 2 from the first guess.
- E is correct and in position 4 (because ✓ at position 4? TARES is T at1, A at2, R at3, E at4, S at5).
  So E is at position 4 and is correct (✓).
- S is not in the word (x).

Now, we know:
- Letters in the word: T (at position 1), A (at position 2), E (at position 4), and R (somewhere else, not position 2 or 3).
- We also have one more letter to find (since it's a 5-letter word).
- Known missing letters: C, N, S.

The secret word structure so far: Position 1 is T, Position 2 is A, Position 4 is E. Position 5 is unknown but not S. Position 3 must be one letter and we also have R to place.

Since R is in the word and not at position 3 (from Guess 2), and not at position 2 (from Guess 1), and position 1 is taken by T (so not 1), the only possible positions for R are position 5? Because positions: 1,2,3,4,5; 
- Position 1: T (so R not here)
- Position 2: A (so R not here)
- Position 3: not allowed (from Guess 2 feedback R(-) at position 3)
- Position 4: E (so R not here)
- Therefore, R must be at position 5.

Position 5 is the only available spot for R.

Also, we know position 5 cannot be S (from Guess 2, S(x)), so it must be R.

Therefore, the secret word must have R at position 5.

So now we have:
Position 1: T
Position 2: A
Position 3: ? (unknown letter, since in Guess 2, position 3 was R but it was wrong, so now we need another letter at position 3)
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

The word is T _ E R, with the third letter missing.

We know that the missing letter cannot be C, N, or S (from previous feedback).

Also, from Guess 1, we have A and E in the word but wrong positions, but now they are placed correctly? In Guess 1, A was at position 3 which was wrong, and now it's at position 2 which is correct. Similarly, E was at position 5 which was wrong, now at position 4 correct. So that aligns.

We need a letter for position 3 that:
- Is not C, N, S (known missing)
- Is a valid English letter.

We also know that the word must be a valid 5-letter word: T A ? E R.

Possible words: TAPER, TAMER, TABER, TAXER, etc. But we have constraints from earlier.

In Guess 1, we had the feedback that E is in the word (at wrong position), now we have it at position 4. But no other constraints.

We need to test possible letters for position 3.

Since we don't have more information, we should pick a word that uses common letters to maximize the chance.

But note: we already know four letters: T, A, E, R. The fifth letter must be the third one.

And we know position 5 is R.

So the secret word is T, A, ?, E, R.

We need to guess a word that fits, but we don't have to include only these? Actually, we can guess any word as long as it's valid, but to solve, we can guess a word that has T at position 1, A at position 2, E at position 4, R at position 5, and one of the possible letters at position 3.

But in the feedback, if we guess such a word, then position 3 letter will be tested.

Common words: TAPER, TABER, TAMER, TASER (but S is out), TAXER, TALER, etc.

But we need to choose one. Since we are allowed only 6 tries, we should aim to cover more possibilities? But we only have one letter to find, so we can try a word that uses a common letter.

We could also consider if there are many possibilities, but we can try ""TAPER"" because it contains P, which is a common letter.

But note: we don't have information about P, so let's see.

The missing letter might be constrained by the fact that we have no other feedback.

Another way: If we are wrong, we get feedback on the position.

So ""TAPER"" would be: positions T at1 (should be ✓), A at2 (✓), P at3 (unknown), E at4 (✓), R at5 (should be ✓). Then the feedback for P would tell us if it's correct or not.

Similarly, we could try ""TAMER"" with M.

But let's list possible letters: any letter except C, N, S. But also, the word must exist.

Common possibilities:
- TAPER: a valid word meaning a candle or to diminish gradually.
- TAMER: one who tames.
- TABER: less common? But TABER is a proper noun? Not sure.
- TAXER: one who taxes.
- TALER: a teller? Not common.
- TARER: one who tares (sets the scale to zero) - possible but rare.
- TABOR, TAWER, etc.

But TABOR is 5 letters? T-A-B-O-R? Wait, with O at position 4? But we need E at position 4? No: our structure is T A ? E R, so position 4 must be E.

Therefore, position 3 could be: 
With T, A, ?, E, R: the ? must be a consonant? We have many options: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, Z? 

But common letters: B, D, L, M, P, etc.

To narrow down, we can choose a word that tests a letter we haven't encountered before? But we have tested several: C, R, A, N, E, T, S (S is out). 

Letters tested and status:
- C: out
- R: in, now assigned to position 5
- A: in at position 2
- N: out
- E: in at position 4
- T: in at position 1
- S: out

Other letters untested: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we know the secret word has exactly these five letters: T, A, ?, E, R. So the third one must be one of the untested letters.

We want to maximize information? But at this point, we know the structure except for one letter, so we can pick a likely candidate.

Perhaps ""TAPER"" is a common word.

But we could choose a word that doesn't assume R at position 5? But from the logic, R must be at position 5 because there is no other spot. Is that correct?

Confirming positions in secret word:

- We have T at position 1, A at position 2, E at position 4.

R must be somewhere. Possible positions: 3, 4, 5? But position 4 is E, so occupied. Position 3: from Guess 2, R was at position 3 and we got ""-"" meaning R is not at position 3. Therefore, R cannot be at position 3. Position 1 and 2 are taken by T and A. Position 5 is the only one left? Position 4 is E.

Yes, R must be at position 5.

Therefore, the word is T? E R, where ? is position 3.

So we need to guess only the third letter.

Therefore, we can try ""TAPER"".

If we guess ""TAPER"", the feedback might be:
- T: ✓ (since position 1)
- A: ✓ (position 2)
- P: ? 
- E: ✓ (position 4)
- R: ✓ (position 5)

If P is correct, we get ✓ for all. If not, P will be x or -.

In this case, P is the third letter. We expect if it's correct, we win; otherwise, we know it's something else.

But we could also guess a word that doesn't have P at all? But we have to include the known letters? Actually, we are required to guess a valid 5-letter word, and we can put arbitrary letters at position 3.

So let's choose ""TAPER"".

But note: we must consider that A, E, R have been moved? But they are confirmed in place? Only the third letter is unknown.

We can also consider other words like ""TAMER"" or ""TALER"".

But I'll go with ""TAPER"" for its commonality.

Another reason: in the previous feedback, E was not at position 5, now we have it at position 4. Similarly, A at position 2.

So third guess: TAPER<step>
Recap of constraints:
- From Guess 1: The word contains R, A, E (wrong positions), but not C or N.
- From Guess 2: 
  - T is at position 1 and correct (✓).
  - A is at position 2 and correct (✓).
  - R is in the word but not at position 3 (given ""R(-)""), so R must be elsewhere.
  - E is at position 4 and correct (✓).
  - S is not in the word (x).
- Also, from Guess 1, R was not at position 2.
- Deduction: The only possible position for R is position 5 (since positions 1, 2, and 4 are occupied, and position 3 is invalid for R). Thus, the secret word must end with R at position 5.

Therefore, the secret word is T A ? E R, where the third letter is unknown and must be a letter not already excluded (not C, N, S).

For the next guess, I will test a word with T at 1, A at 2, E at 4, and R at 5, varying the third letter to identify what it is. Since ""TAPER"" is a common word that fits this pattern, I choose it to test ""P"" at position 3.

If ""P"" is correct, the game is won. If not, the feedback will help narrow down further possibilities.

Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C (x), R (-), A (-), N (x), E (-).  
  → R, A, E are in the word but not in positions 2, 3, or 5. C and N are absent.
  
- **Guess 2 (TARES)**: T (✓), A (✓), R (-), E (✓), S (x).  
  → T and A are fixed at positions 1 and 2 (✓). E is fixed at position 4 (✓). R is in the word but not in position 3 (-). S is absent (x).  
  → R must be in position 5 (since positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are invalid for R).

**Deduction**:
- The secret word has the form: `T A ? E R` (position 1: T, 2: A, 4: E, 5: R).
- Position 3 is the only unknown letter (cannot be C, N, S).
- Test ""TAPER"" to validate the third letter ""P"". If ""P"" is correct, all positions will match (✓); otherwise, feedback will help eliminate possibilities.

- Position 1: T (so R not here)
- Position 2: A (so R not here)
- Position 3: not allowed (from Guess 2 feedback R(-) at position 3)

Position 5 is the only available spot for R.

Also, we know position 5 cannot be S (from Guess 2, S(x)), so it must be R.

Therefore, the secret word must have R at position 5.

Position 3: ? (unknown letter, since in Guess 2, position 3 was R but it was wrong, so now we need another letter at position 3)
Position 4: E
Position 5: R

The word is T _ E R, with the third letter missing.

We know that the missing letter cannot be C, N, or S (from previous feedback).

Also, from Guess 1, we have A and E in the word but wrong positions, but now they are placed correctly? In Guess 1, A was at position 3 which was wrong, and now it's at position 2 which is correct. Similarly, E was at position 5 which was wrong, now at position 4 correct. So that aligns.
