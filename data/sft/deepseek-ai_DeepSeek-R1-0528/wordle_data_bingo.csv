We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we should choose a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word often uses common letters and has a balanced letter distribution to cover as many possibilities as early as possible.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""AUDIO"", etc. Let's choose one that has five distinct letters and covers common vowels and consonants.

 After some thought, I will go with ""SLATE"". It has 'S', 'L', 'A', 'T', 'E' — common letters, and it includes two vowels (A and E) and three consonants.

We have feedback from the first guess ""slate"": all letters are marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters S, L, A, T, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid using any of these letters in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain S, L, A, T, or E.

 Since we have eliminated these common letters, we should look for another word that uses other common letters to maximize information.

 Common letters in English include: R, I, O, N, U, D, C, M, P, etc.

 We can try a word that uses as many of the remaining common letters as possible.

 Let's consider the word ""crown"", but note that we must avoid the eliminated letters. ""Crown"" has C, R, O, W, N. None of these are in the excluded set (S,L,A,T,E). So that could be a candidate.

 Alternatively, ""round"" has R, O, U, N, D. Also avoids the excluded letters.

 Another option: ""pound"" has P, O, U, N, D.

 But note that we want to cover as many new letters as possible. Let's think of a word that includes more common consonants and vowels.

 Since we have eliminated A and E, the vowels we have left are I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We should try to include at least one vowel.

 The word ""audio"" is often used, but it has A and we cannot use A. So that's out.

 How about ""curio""? But that has 6 letters. We need 5 letters.

 Let's try ""crony"": C, R, O, N, Y. This avoids S,L,A,T,E.

 Another option: ""prion"" - P, R, I, O, N.

 Or ""mourn"": M, O, U, R, N.

 We can also consider ""dumpy"": D, U, M, P, Y. But note that Y is sometimes a vowel.

 However, we have no information yet on any letters, so we want to test a new set of common letters.

 After eliminating S,L,A,T,E, the next most common letters are: O, R, N, I, C, U, M, P, D, etc.

 Let's choose a word that uses five of these. We can try ""crimp"": C, R, I, M, P. This avoids the excluded letters.

 But note that we have to make sure the word is valid. ""Crimp"" is a valid English word.

 Another good candidate: ""pound"" (P, O, U, N, D) or ""round"" (R, O, U, N, D).

 However, we might want to include the letter I because it's a common vowel. Since we don't have A or E, we should test I and O or U.

 Let me think of a word that has I and O and other common consonants.

 The word ""robin"" has R, O, B, I, N. But note that we haven't eliminated B, so that's acceptable.

 However, we must avoid the letters from the first guess. So ""robin"" is acceptable: R, O, B, I, N (none of S,L,A,T,E).

 Similarly, ""crony"" is acceptable.

 But let's consider that we want to maximize the chance of getting hits. We have no information, so we are fishing for new letters.

 I think ""robin"" is a good choice because it has two vowels (O and I) and three common consonants (R, B, N).

 Alternatively, ""round"" has O and U (two vowels) and R, N, D (common consonants).

 Since we don't know which vowels might be present (other than not A or E), testing both O and U might be good? But we can only test one at a time.

 However, we have 6 tries, so we can spread out.

 Another idea: the word ""ouija"" is not allowed because it has A and J is not that common, and also it's 5 letters but we avoid A.

 Let me list some words that avoid S,L,A,T,E:

 - crown (C,R,O,W,N)
 - round (R,O,U,N,D)
 - pound (P,O,U,N,D)
 - pinch (P,I,N,C,H)
 - crick (C,R,I,C,K) -> but has duplicate C, which might not be efficient.

 We should avoid duplicate letters in the early guesses to maximize information.

 So ""crown"" has no duplicates, and ""round"" has no duplicates.

 I think ""round"" is a good choice because it uses the vowel U and O, and common consonants R, N, D.

 But note: we are not sure if the word has any of these. We are just trying to cover new ground.

 Alternatively, we can use ""crony"" (C,R,O,N,Y) to test C and Y.

 However, Y is less common than U or D. So ""round"" might be better.

 Another common word: ""pound"" (P,O,U,N,D) is similar to ""round"" but with P instead of R.

 Since R is more common than P, we might prefer ""round"".

 But we don't know which letters are more common in the remaining set. So either is fine.

 Let's go with ""round"".

 However, note that we are going to get feedback on each letter. We can then use that to narrow down.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that includes I, such as ""prion"" (P,R,I,O,N) to test I and O.

 Since we have eliminated two vowels (A and E), we should test the remaining vowels (I, O, U) as much as possible.

 The word ""audio"" is not possible because of A. So we can't test all three at once.

 We can test two vowels in one word. For example, ""ourie"" is not valid and also has E.

 How about ""curio""? 6 letters. Not valid.

 ""ruin"" is 4 letters.

 We need 5 letters. How about ""ionic""? I,O,N,I,C -> duplicate I, so not good.

 ""opium"" has duplicate? O,P,I,U,M -> no duplicate, but M is a common consonant. But ""opium"" is a valid word.

 However, we are playing a word game and we should stick to common words. ""Opium"" might be considered a drug and not ideal, but it is a word.

 Alternatively, ""doubt"" has O and U? D,O,U,B,T -> but T is eliminated! We cannot use T because the first guess had T and it was marked x.

 So we must avoid T.

 Therefore, we cannot use ""doubt"".

 Let me think of a word that has I and U and avoids the excluded letters.

 ""guilt"" has G,U,I,L,T -> but L and T are excluded.

 ""build"" has B,U,I,L,D -> L is excluded.

 ""quirk"" has Q,U,I,R,K -> Q is not very common, but it avoids the excluded letters.

 But we want common letters. So maybe not.

 How about ""music""? M,U,S,I,C -> but S is excluded.

 ""juicy"" has J,U,I,C,Y -> J is not common.

 It's challenging to get both I and U without using excluded letters.

 So maybe we should stick to one vowel per guess? Or use O and I.

 The word ""robin"" (R,O,B,I,N) is a good candidate: it has O and I, and common consonants.

 Another: ""crony"" (C,R,O,N,Y) has O and Y (Y can be a vowel).

 But I think ""robin"" is a solid choice.

 Alternatively, ""pound"" (P,O,U,N,D) has O and U.

 Since we have two vowels to test (I, O, U) and we can test two of them in two guesses, we can choose either.

 I'll go with ""robin"" because it tests I and O, and the consonants R, B, N.

 So the next guess: ""robin""

 But note: we must ensure that the word is in the word list. I believe ""robin"" is a common word.

 Therefore, I choose ""robin"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback, all letters in ""slate"" (S, L, A, T, E) are absent from the secret word. Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely. To maximize information, I selected a word with common letters not yet tested, focusing on vowels like I and O (since A and E are eliminated) and consonants like R, B, and N. The word ""robin"" fits these criteria and is a valid 5-letter English word.

 Alternatively, we can use ""crony"" (C,R,O,N,Y) to test C and Y.

 However, Y is less common than U or D. So ""round"" might be better.

 Another common word: ""pound"" (P,O,U,N,D) is similar to ""round"" but with P instead of R.

 Since R is more common than P, we might prefer ""round"".

 But we don't know which letters are more common in the remaining set. So either is fine.

 Let's go with ""round"".

 However, note that we are going to get feedback on each letter. We can then use that to narrow down.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that includes I, such as ""prion"" (P,R,I,O,N) to test I and O.

 Since we have eliminated two vowels (A and E), we should test the remaining vowels (I, O, U) as much as possible.

 The word ""audio"" is not possible because of A. So we can't test all three at once.

 We can test two vowels in one word. For example, ""ourie"" is not valid and also has E.

 How about ""curio""? 6 letters. Not valid.

 ""ruin"" is 4 letters.

 We need 5 letters. How about ""ionic""? I,O,N,I,C -> duplicate I, so not good.

 ""opium"" has duplicate? O,P,I,U,M -> no duplicate, but M is a common consonant. But ""opium"" is a valid word.

 However, we are playing a word game and we should stick to common words. ""Opium"" might be considered a drug and not ideal, but it is a word.

 Alternatively, ""doubt"" has O and U? D,O,U,B,T -> but T is eliminated! We cannot use T because the first guess had T and it was marked x.

 So we must avoid T.

 Therefore, we cannot use ""doubt"".

 Let me think of a word that has I and U and avoids the excluded letters.

 ""guilt"" has G,U,I,L,T -> but L and T are excluded.

 ""build"" has B,U,I,L,D -> L is excluded.

 ""quirk"" has Q,U,I,R,K -> Q is not very common, but it avoids the excluded letters.

 But we want common letters. So maybe not.

 How about ""music""? M,U,S,I,C -> but S is excluded.

 ""juicy"" has J,U,I,C,Y -> J is not common.

 It's challenging to get both I and U without using excluded letters.

 So maybe we should stick to one vowel per guess? Or use O and I.

 The word ""robin"" (R,O,B,I,N) is a good candidate: it has O and I, and common consonants.

 Another: ""crony"" (C,R,O,N,Y) has O and Y (Y can be a vowel).

 But I think ""robin"" is a solid choice.

 Alternatively, ""pound"" (P,O,U,N,D) has O and U.

 Since we have two vowels to test (I, O, U) and we can test two of them in two guesses, we can choose either.

 I'll go with ""robin"" because it tests I and O, and the consonants R, B, N.

 So the next guess: ""robin""

 But note: we must ensure that the word is in the word list. I believe ""robin"" is a common word.

 Therefore, I choose ""robin"".Based on the previous feedback, all letters in ""slate"" (S, L, A, T, E) are absent from the secret word. Therefore, the new guess must avoid these letters entirely. To maximize information, I selected a word with common letters not yet tested, focusing on vowels like I and O (since A and E are eliminated) and consonants like R, B, and N. The word ""robin"" fits these criteria and is a valid 5-letter English word.

We have feedback from the first two guesses:
- Guess 1: ""slate"" -> all letters are absent (S, L, A, T, E are not in the word at all).
- Guess 2: ""robin"" -> R is absent, but O, B, I, N are present but in the wrong positions.

So, the secret word contains the letters O, B, I, N, but none of them are in the positions they were in ""robin"". Also, we know that the word does not contain S, L, A, T, E, or R.

Since O, B, I, N are present, the secret word has these four letters, and one more letter that we haven't guessed yet.

The positions in ""robin"" are:
1. R (absent)
2. O (present, but wrong position)
3. B (present, but wrong position)
4. I (present, but wrong position)
5. N (present, but wrong position)

Therefore, in the secret word:
- O cannot be in position 2.
- B cannot be in position 3.
- I cannot be in position 4.
- N cannot be in position 5.

We need to find a 5-letter word that includes O, B, I, N and one additional letter (not from the excluded set: S,L,A,T,E,R). Also, the word must not have any of the excluded letters.

The additional letter must be a letter that hasn't been tried yet. We have used: S,L,A,T,E,R,O,B,I,N. So the available letters are the rest of the alphabet.

We need to consider the positions. Since all four letters (O,B,I,N) are present but in wrong positions, we must place them in different positions.

Possible positions for O: not 2 -> so 1,3,4,5
Similarly for B: not 3 -> so 1,2,4,5
For I: not 4 -> so 1,2,3,5
For N: not 5 -> so 1,2,3,4

We also need to add one more letter, which will be in one of the positions.

We can think of the word as having 5 positions. We know that the four letters O,B,I,N must be in the word, but not in the positions we tried, and the fifth letter is unknown.

We should try to form words that contain O,B,I,N and one other letter, and satisfy the position constraints.

Let me list some words that have O,B,I,N and one other consonant or vowel (but not S,L,A,T,E,R).

Possible additional letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should focus on common letters.

Note: We haven't used U yet, and it's a vowel. Also, common consonants like C, D, M, P, etc.

We must avoid the excluded letters: S,L,A,T,E,R.

Now, let's try to form words:

One common word that comes to mind is ""bonus"", but it has S which is excluded.

Another: ""robin"" we already tried, but we know the positions are wrong.

What about ""bison""? But it has S (excluded) and also the positions: in ""bison"", B is in position 1, I in 2, S in 3, O in 4, N in 5. But we know that in the secret word, N cannot be in position 5, and in ""bison"" it is, so that would be invalid if it were the word, but also S is excluded.

We need a word without S.

Another idea: ""boing"" - but that's not a common word, and it ends with G. Also, in ""boing"", B is position 1, O position 2, I position 3, N position 4, G position 5. But we know O cannot be in position 2 (from the feedback of ""robin"" where O was in position 2 and was wrong). So if we use ""boing"", O is in position 2 again, which we know is not allowed because in the secret word O is not in position 2. So that would be a waste.

We must avoid putting O in position 2, B in 3, I in 4, N in 5.

So for the new guess, we should try to put these letters in different positions to test new arrangements.

Moreover, we need to include the fifth letter.

Let me think of words that have O,B,I,N and one more letter.

Possible words:
- ""bingo"": B, I, N, G, O. But note the positions: B in 1, I in 2, N in 3, G in 4, O in 5.
  Now, check constraints:
  - O is in position 5: allowed (since it cannot be in 2, but 5 is fine).
  - B is in position 1: allowed (not 3).
  - I is in position 2: allowed (not 4).
  - N is in position 3: allowed (not 5).
  - The new letter is G, which is not excluded.

So ""bingo"" seems to satisfy the position constraints and uses G as the fifth letter.

But we must check if it's a valid word. Yes, ""bingo"" is a valid word.

Another possibility: ""boink"" - B, O, I, N, K. Positions: B1, O2, I3, N4, K5.
But O is in position 2, which is not allowed (from feedback: O cannot be in position 2). So invalid for our guess.

Another: ""bonnie"" - but it has E (excluded) and also duplicate N? B,O,N,N,I - duplicate N, and E is excluded.

""bionic"" is 6 letters.

""bonny"" is 5 letters: B,O,N,N,Y - duplicate N? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback from ""robin"" had no duplicates and we had four distinct letters present, so the secret word might have duplicates? But we don't know. However, in ""robin"" we had one absent (R) and four present, so the secret word has at least those four. It might have a duplicate of one of them or a new letter.

But in ""bonny"", it has two N's. That's possible, but we don't have evidence for duplicates. Also, O is in position 2 again, which is not allowed.

So ""bonny"" is not good.

Another word: ""bound"" - but it has U and D, but no I? We must have I in the word because the feedback said I is present. So the word must contain I. Similarly, it must contain O, B, I, N. ""bound"" has B,O,U,N,D - no I, so it doesn't have I, which we know is present. So invalid.

Similarly, ""pound"" has P,O,U,N,D - no I or B.

We need a word that has all of O,B,I,N and one more.

Another word: ""brown"" - but it has W and no I? B,R,O,W,N - but R is excluded, and no I.

""bring"" - has R (excluded) and no O? B,R,I,N,G - no O.

""being"" - has E (excluded).

""boast"" - has A and S and T, all excluded.

So ""bingo"" seems a good candidate.

But let's see the positions in ""bingo"":
Position 1: B -> in ""robin"", B was in position 3 and was wrong. Now we put B in position 1, which is a new position, so it might be correct or wrong, but we are testing.
Position 2: I -> in ""robin"", I was in position 4 and was wrong. Now we put I in position 2, which is new.
Position 3: N -> in ""robin"", N was in position 5 and was wrong. Now we put N in position 3, new.
Position 4: G -> new letter.
Position 5: O -> in ""robin"", O was in position 2 and was wrong. Now we put O in position 5, new.

So all the letters from the previous present set are in new positions, and we are introducing G.

This guess will tell us which of these positions are correct and also if G is in the word.

But note: we know that the word has exactly these five letters? Not necessarily, because there might be duplicates, but we don't have evidence. We assume no duplicates for now.

Another candidate: ""owing"" - but it doesn't have B or I? O,W,I,N,G - missing B.

""bingo"" seems the best so far.

What about ""bingy""? Not a common word.

""dobie"" - has D,O,B,I,E -> but E is excluded.

""nobly"" - N,O,B,L,Y -> but L is excluded.

""bunco"" - B,U,N,C,O -> missing I? We need I.

""biont"" - B,I,O,N,T -> but T is excluded.

So ""bingo"" is a valid option.

Another word: ""goblin"" is 6 letters.

""begin"" - has E and no O? B,E,G,I,N -> E excluded.

""bogey"" - has E and Y, but no I? B,O,G,E,Y -> E excluded.

So I think ""bingo"" is a good guess.

But note: in ""bingo"", we are putting I in position 2. In the feedback from ""robin"", I was in position 4 and was wrong, but it could be in position 2. Similarly for others.

We might get some correct positions now.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses a different fifth letter to cover more ground, but ""bingo"" uses G, which is a common letter.

Another word: ""pinot"" - but has T excluded. P,I,N,O,T -> T excluded.

""ionic"" - I,O,N,I,C -> duplicate I? And no B.

We must have B.

So I think ""bingo"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, the next guess is ""bingo"".

But let's double-check the excluded letters: S,L,A,T,E,R. ""bingo"" has B,I,N,G,O - none of these are excluded.

And the position constraints are satisfied: no letter is in the forbidden position from the previous guess.

So we'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""slate"" had all letters absent (S, L, A, T, E are not in the word).
- ""robin"" had R absent, but O, B, I, N present and in the wrong positions (O not in position 2, B not in position 3, I not in position 4, N not in position 5).

The secret word must contain O, B, I, and N, but none in the positions they appeared in ""robin"". It must also include one additional letter not yet tested (and not S, L, A, T, E, or R). 

After evaluating possible words that fit these constraints, ""bingo"" is a strong candidate because:
- It includes all required letters (O, B, I, N) and introduces G as the new letter.
- It adheres to position constraints: B is in position 1 (not 3), I in position 2 (not 4), N in position 3 (not 5), and O in position 5 (not 2).
- It avoids all excluded letters (S, L, A, T, E, R).

This guess will help verify the positions of O, B, I, N and test if G is part of the word.

So ""bingo"" seems to satisfy the position constraints and uses G as the fifth letter.

But we must check if it's a valid word. Yes, ""bingo"" is a valid word.

Another possibility: ""boink"" - B, O, I, N, K. Positions: B1, O2, I3, N4, K5.
But O is in position 2, which is not allowed (from feedback: O cannot be in position 2). So invalid for our guess.

Another: ""bonnie"" - but it has E (excluded) and also duplicate N? B,O,N,N,I - duplicate N, and E is excluded.

""bionic"" is 6 letters.

""bonny"" is 5 letters: B,O,N,N,Y - duplicate N? But we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. The feedback from ""robin"" had no duplicates and we had four distinct letters present, so the secret word might have duplicates? But we don't know. However, in ""robin"" we had one absent (R) and four present, so the secret word has at least those four. It might have a duplicate of one of them or a new letter.

But in ""bonny"", it has two N's. That's possible, but we don't have evidence for duplicates. Also, O is in position 2 again, which is not allowed.

So ""bonny"" is not good.

Another word: ""bound"" - but it has U and D, but no I? We must have I in the word because the feedback said I is present. So the word must contain I. Similarly, it must contain O, B, I, N. ""bound"" has B,O,U,N,D - no I, so it doesn't have I, which we know is present. So invalid.

Similarly, ""pound"" has P,O,U,N,D - no I or B.

We need a word that has all of O,B,I,N and one more.

Another word: ""brown"" - but it has W and no I? B,R,O,W,N - but R is excluded, and no I.

""bring"" - has R (excluded) and no O? B,R,I,N,G - no O.

""being"" - has E (excluded).

""boast"" - has A and S and T, all excluded.

So ""bingo"" seems a good candidate.

But let's see the positions in ""bingo"":
Position 1: B -> in ""robin"", B was in position 3 and was wrong. Now we put B in position 1, which is a new position, so it might be correct or wrong, but we are testing.
Position 2: I -> in ""robin"", I was in position 4 and was wrong. Now we put I in position 2, which is new.
Position 3: N -> in ""robin"", N was in position 5 and was wrong. Now we put N in position 3, new.
Position 4: G -> new letter.
Position 5: O -> in ""robin"", O was in position 2 and was wrong. Now we put O in position 5, new.

So all the letters from the previous present set are in new positions, and we are introducing G.

This guess will tell us which of these positions are correct and also if G is in the word.

But note: we know that the word has exactly these five letters? Not necessarily, because there might be duplicates, but we don't have evidence. We assume no duplicates for now.

Another candidate: ""owing"" - but it doesn't have B or I? O,W,I,N,G - missing B.

""bingo"" seems the best so far.

What about ""bingy""? Not a common word.

""dobie"" - has D,O,B,I,E -> but E is excluded.

""nobly"" - N,O,B,L,Y -> but L is excluded.

""bunco"" - B,U,N,C,O -> missing I? We need I.

""biont"" - B,I,O,N,T -> but T is excluded.

So ""bingo"" is a valid option.

Another word: ""goblin"" is 6 letters.

""begin"" - has E and no O? B,E,G,I,N -> E excluded.

""bogey"" - has E and Y, but no I? B,O,G,E,Y -> E excluded.

So I think ""bingo"" is a good guess.

But note: in ""bingo"", we are putting I in position 2. In the feedback from ""robin"", I was in position 4 and was wrong, but it could be in position 2. Similarly for others.

We might get some correct positions now.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses a different fifth letter to cover more ground, but ""bingo"" uses G, which is a common letter.

Another word: ""pinot"" - but has T excluded. P,I,N,O,T -> T excluded.

""ionic"" - I,O,N,I,C -> duplicate I? And no B.

We must have B.

So I think ""bingo"" is a solid choice.

Therefore, the next guess is ""bingo"".

But let's double-check the excluded letters: S,L,A,T,E,R. ""bingo"" has B,I,N,G,O - none of these are excluded.

And the position constraints are satisfied: no letter is in the forbidden position from the previous guess.

So we'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""slate"" had all letters absent (S, L, A, T, E are not in the word).
- ""robin"" had R absent, but O, B, I, N present and in the wrong positions (O not in position 2, B not in position 3, I not in position 4, N not in position 5).

The secret word must contain O, B, I, and N, but none in the positions they appeared in ""robin"". It must also include one additional letter not yet tested (and not S, L, A, T, E, or R). 

After evaluating possible words that fit these constraints, ""bingo"" is a strong candidate because:
- It includes all required letters (O, B, I, N) and introduces G as the new letter.
- It adheres to position constraints: B is in position 1 (not 3), I in position 2 (not 4), N in position 3 (not 5), and O in position 5 (not 2).
- It avoids all excluded letters (S, L, A, T, E, R).

This guess will help verify the positions of O, B, I, N and test if G is part of the word.",Guess 3: bingo -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓) O(✓),SUCCESS
