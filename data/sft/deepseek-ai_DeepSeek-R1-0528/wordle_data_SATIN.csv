We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: - (in the word but wrong position)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the secret word at all.
- The letters A and N are in the word, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Since A was in position 3 and N in position 4, they must be in other positions.

We must avoid using C, R, E in our next guess because they are absent.

We also know that A and N are present, so our next guess should include A and N, but in different positions.

Let's think of a new word that:
- Is 5 letters
- Contains A and N
- Does not contain C, R, E
- And we can use other common letters to test.

We have to place A and N in positions different from 3 and 4.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (since it was in 3 and that was wrong)
Similarly for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (since it was in 4 and that was wrong)

We also want to test other common consonants and vowels to get more information.

Common letters we haven't tried: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, H, etc.

Let's try to form a word that includes A and N, and avoids C, R, E.

One common word that comes to mind is ""PLANT"", but let's check:
- P, L, A, N, T
But note: we don't know if P, L, T are in the word or not.

However, we must avoid C, R, E.

Another word: ""SALAD"" - but it has two A's and we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we have A and N to include, but SALAD doesn't have N.

We need a word with both A and N.

Let's try ""MANGO"" - but M, A, N, G, O. We avoid C, R, E.

But note: we don't know about M, G, O.

Another word: ""PAINT"" - P, A, I, N, T. This has A and N, and avoids C, R, E.

This seems good because it tests new letters: P, I, T.

Also, in ""PAINT"":
- A is in position 2 (was 3 in crane, so different)
- N is in position 4 (was 4 in crane? But in crane N was in position 4 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not in that position. So we must put N in a different position. In ""PAINT"", N is in position 4? That's the same position as in crane. We cannot put N in position 4 again because we know it's not in position 4.

So we must avoid putting N in position 4.

Therefore, ""PAINT"" is invalid because it puts N in position 4 again.

We need a word that has A and N, and N is not in position 4, and A is not in position 3.

Let's try ""SANDY"":
- S, A, N, D, Y
- A is in position 2 (not 3) -> good
- N is in position 3 (not 4) -> good
- Avoids C, R, E.

But we don't know about S, D, Y.

Another word: ""ADMIN"" - but that might be less common. Also, A is in position 1, N in position 5? That's different.

But let's stick to common words.

Another common word: ""STAND"" - but it has S, T, A, N, D. However, it has T and D which we haven't tested.

But note: ""STAND"" has A in position 3? Let's see:
S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5)

But in our feedback, A was in position 3 and we got a '-' meaning A is not in position 3. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.

In ""STAND"", A is in position 3 -> invalid.

We need to avoid position 3 for A and position 4 for N.

So let's try ""DANDY"" - but D, A, N, D, Y. A is in position 2, N in position 3. That's okay. But it has two D's? And we don't know about D and Y.

But we can try.

Alternatively, ""LAPIN"" (a less common word) or ""PANDA"".

""PANDA"": P, A, N, D, A
- A is in position 2 and 5. But we know A is in the word at least once. We don't know if it appears twice.
- N is in position 3 (not 4) -> good.

But we have two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's.

We can try ""PANDA"", but let's see if there's a better word.

Another word: ""SAINT"" - S, A, I, N, T
- A is in position 2 (not 3) -> good
- N is in position 4? But we cannot put N in position 4 because we know it's not in position 4. So invalid.

We must avoid position 4 for N.

So ""SAINT"" is invalid.

""TANGY"": T, A, N, G, Y
- A in position 2 (not 3) -> good
- N in position 3 (not 4) -> good
- Avoids C, R, E.

This seems acceptable.

Another option: ""WAGON"" - W, A, G, O, N. But N is in position 5 (not 4) and A in position 2 (not 3). Good.

But we have more common words? ""TANGY"" is a bit less common. Let's try ""PAINT"" but we can't because of N position.

Wait, what about ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N
- A in position 3? We cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not there. So invalid.

""ALIGN"": A, L, I, G, N
- A in position 1 (not 3) -> good
- N in position 5 (not 4) -> good
- Avoids C, R, E.

This is a good word.

Similarly, ""ADMIN"" as before.

But let's choose a common word. ""ALIGN"" is common.

Another one: ""ANVIL"" - A, N, V, I, L
- A in position 1 (good)
- N in position 2 (good, because not 4) -> but wait, we don't know if N can be in position 2? We only know it's not in 4. So it can be in 2.
- Avoids C, R, E.

But ""ANVIL"" is a word.

I think ""ALIGN"" is a good choice because it tests A, L, I, G, N.

So let's go with ""ALIGN"".

We are also testing L, I, G which are new.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So the next guess: ""ALIGN""

But note: we must make sure it's a valid word.

Yes, ""align"" is a valid English word.

So, we'll guess ""ALIGN"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and N are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A was in position 3 and N in position 4, so they must appear in other positions.

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N (since they are confirmed present).
- A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4.
- Avoid using C, R, or E (as they are absent).
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

A suitable word is ""ALIGN"":
- A is in position 1 (different from position 3).
- N is in position 5 (different from position 4).

We must avoid position 4 for N.

So ""SAINT"" is invalid.

""TANGY"": T, A, N, G, Y
- A in position 2 (not 3) -> good
- N in position 3 (not 4) -> good
- Avoids C, R, E.

This seems acceptable.

Another option: ""WAGON"" - W, A, G, O, N. But N is in position 5 (not 4) and A in position 2 (not 3). Good.

But we have more common words? ""TANGY"" is a bit less common. Let's try ""PAINT"" but we can't because of N position.

Wait, what about ""PLAIN"": P, L, A, I, N
- A in position 3? We cannot put A in position 3 because we know it's not there. So invalid.

""ALIGN"": A, L, I, G, N
- A in position 1 (not 3) -> good
- N in position 5 (not 4) -> good
- Avoids C, R, E.

This is a good word.

Similarly, ""ADMIN"" as before.

But let's choose a common word. ""ALIGN"" is common.

Another one: ""ANVIL"" - A, N, V, I, L
- A in position 1 (good)
- N in position 2 (good, because not 4) -> but wait, we don't know if N can be in position 2? We only know it's not in 4. So it can be in 2.
- Avoids C, R, E.

But ""ANVIL"" is a word.

I think ""ALIGN"" is a good choice because it tests A, L, I, G, N.

So let's go with ""ALIGN"".

We are also testing L, I, G which are new.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

So the next guess: ""ALIGN""

But note: we must make sure it's a valid word.

Yes, ""align"" is a valid English word.

So, we'll guess ""ALIGN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are not in the secret word (marked with ""x"").
- A and N are in the word but in the wrong positions (marked with ""-""). Specifically, A was in position 3 and N in position 4, so they must appear in other positions.

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N (since they are confirmed present).
- A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4.
- Avoid using C, R, or E (as they are absent).
- Test new common letters to gather more information.

A suitable word is ""ALIGN"":
- A is in position 1 (different from position 3).
- N is in position 5 (different from position 4).
- Includes new letters L, I, G to test for presence/position.
- Avoids C, R, E.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
This means:
- C, R, E are not in the word at all.
- A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N is in the word but not in position 4.

Guess 2: align -> FEEDBACK: A(-) L(x) I(-) G(x) N(✓)
This means:
- A is in the word but not in position 1 (since we put A in position 1 and got a '-', meaning wrong position).
- L is not in the word at all.
- I is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was in position 3 in this guess).
- G is not in the word at all.
- N is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5 (since in ""align"", N is the last letter).

So, summarizing what we know:

1. Absent letters: C, R, E, L, G (so we must avoid these).
2. Present letters:
   - A: present, but not in position 1 (from guess 2) and not in position 3 (from guess 1). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
   - I: present, but not in position 3 (from guess 2). So I could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
   - N: present and fixed in position 5 (because we got a ✓ for N in position 5 in guess 2). So N is the last letter.

Since N is in position 5, the secret word is _ _ _ _ N.

We have A and I present, and they are not in certain positions.

We also know that the word has at least three letters: A, I, N (since N is fixed at the end).

We have two more positions (1,2,3,4) but note that position 5 is N. So positions 1-4 are to be filled, but we know A and I are two of the letters, and there might be two more letters we haven't discovered yet.

We have tested and discarded several letters: C, R, E, L, G.

We have two absent letters from guess 2: L and G.

So total absent: C, R, E, L, G.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with N (position 5)
- Contains A and I (since we know they are present)
- Does not contain any of C, R, E, L, G.
- A cannot be in position 1 or 3 (from feedback) -> so A must be in position 2 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2) -> so I must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Additionally, we need to test other common letters to find the remaining letters.

We have one more piece of information: in guess 1, A was in position 3 and we got a -, so A is not in 3. Similarly, N was in position 4 and we got a -, but now we know N is in position 5, which is consistent because position 4 was wrong.

Now, since A must be in position 2 or 4, and I must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).

We also have to consider that position 3 must be filled by another letter.

Let's think of words ending with N and containing A and I, excluding the absent letters.

Common possibilities: 
- Words like _ _ _ A N, but A is in position 4? Then I could be in 1 or 2? But I cannot be in position 3.
- Or _ A _ I N, etc.

Let's try to come up with candidate words.

One common word: ""TRAIN"" but R is absent (from feedback), so cannot use R.

Another: ""PLAIN"" but P and L? L is absent and P is untested? Wait, L is absent so we cannot use L.

Absent letters: C, R, E, L, G.

So available letters: let's list the alphabet without these: A,B,D,F,H,I,J,K,M,N,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But we have A, I, N already present.

Now, considering positions:

Position 5: N

Position 4: if we put A there, then we have positions 1,2,3 for I and two other letters.

But I cannot be in position 3? Actually from feedback, I cannot be in position 3? In guess 2, we put I in position 3 and got a '-', meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So I must be in 1,2, or 4? But position 4 might be taken by A? So if A is in 4, then I must be in 1 or 2.

Similarly, if A is in 2, then I can be in 1,2 (but position 2 would then have both A and I? That's impossible unless the same letter appears twice? But we don't know yet. We know the word has at least A, I, N, but there might be duplicates? Not necessarily.

Actually, A and I are two distinct letters. So they must be in different positions.

Therefore, we have two scenarios:

Scenario 1: A in position 2
Then I must be in position 1 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth position, and position 5 is N. So position 4: if I is there? But it could be.

Scenario 2: A in position 4
Then I must be in position 1 or 2 (since it cannot be in 3).

Also note position 3 needs to be filled by a new letter.

Let's list words ending in N that have A and I, and avoid the absent letters.

Words that end in N with A and I: 
- ""CHAIN"" -> but C and H? C is absent so invalid.
- ""TRAIN"" -> R is absent.
- ""SPAIN"" -> S, P, A, I, N: but S and P are untested? But does it fit?
  - Positions: S(1), P(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)? But we must be careful: 
    - A in position 3? But we know from guess 1 that A is not in position 3! So invalid.
- ""PLAIN"" -> L absent so invalid.
- ""THAIN"" -> not so common? And H untested.
- ""VIZAIN""? not a word.

Another: ""BRINE"" but R and E absent? No.

""ABOUT"" doesn't end with N.

Try ""MAJOR"" doesn't end with N.

""PAINT"" -> P, A, I, N, T. Ending: A,I,N present? 
Positions: P1, A2, I3, N4? But wait, we have position 5 is N? In ""PAINT"", N is in position 4, but we need N in position 5. So words must be ????N, so five letters: position 1,2,3,4,5 with 5=N.

In ""PAINT"", the word is 5 letters but ends with T? Not N.

So we need words that end with 'N'. For example: ""MAIN?"" but only 4 letters.

Full words: ""RAINY"" doesn't end with N.

Words ending in N: -ION, -IAN, etc.

Specific word: ""URBAN"" but U,R,B? R is absent, so no.

""BATON"" ends with N? T-O-N? No, O is in position 4? BATON: B,A,T,O,N -> positions: B1, A2, T3, O4, N5. Now check:
- A in position 2? That's possible because A must be in 2 or 4? Here it is in 2.
- I is supposed to be present? But in ""BATON"", there is no I. But we know I must be in the word. So ""BATON"" doesn't have I. Invalid.

Therefore, we must include I.

Words with I and ending with N: 
- ""OPIUM"" doesn't end with N? Let's think common words.

""ADMIN"" -> A,D,M,I,N: 
- Positions: A1, D2, M3, I4, N5? 
But: A is in position 1? We know from guess 2 that A cannot be in position 1 (because in ""align"" we had A in position 1 and got '-', meaning it isn't there). So A cannot be in 1. Therefore ""ADMIN"" has A in 1 -> invalid.

Another: ""CHAFIN"" not a word.

""PLAIN"" -> has L (absent) so invalid.

""TAMIN"" ? Not common.

""BASIN"" -> B,A,S,I,N: 
- Positions: B1, A2, S3, I4, N5? 
Now check constraints:
- A is in position 2 -> allowed (since A can be in 2 or 4)
- I is in position 4 -> allowed (I can be in 1,2,4; not 3)
- Does not use absent letters: B, S are not in absent list? Absent are C,R,E,L,G. So B and S are okay.
- Word ends with N.

So ""basin"" is a word: meaning like a wash basin.

But does it fit feedback? We haven't tested B and S.

Yes, we should test B and S.

In ""BASIN"":
- Position 1: B (untested)
- Position 2: A -> we know A is present, and position 2 is a new position for A (previously tried 3 and 1). It might be correct?
- Position 3: S (untested)
- Position 4: I -> we know I is present, but previously tried only at position 3 (which was wrong). Position 4 is new for I.
- Position 5: N -> correct and fixed.

Is there a problem? We don't know if B and S are present? That's why we need to test.

Another common word: ""CHAIN"" -> C is absent, invalid.

""MAINS"" -> ends with S, not N? MAINS is S. Not ending with N.

""WAIVIN""? no.

""DIANE""? but ends with E? E is absent anyway? Not valid.

Another: ""SATIN"" -> S,A,T,I,N: ends with N? S-A-T-I-N, actually ""SATIN"" ends with N? Yes: S1, A2, T3, I4, N5.

Similar to ""BASIN"".

Check constraints for ""SATIN"":
- A in position 2 -> allowed.
- I in position 4 -> allowed.
- T in position 3 -> we haven't tested T.
- Does not use absent letters: S,T are not in the absent list.

So ""SATIN"" and ""BASIN"" are similar.

We could also consider ""INANE""? But I in position 1?, A in position 3? But A cannot be in position 3! From guess 1, A is not in position 3.

In ""INANE"": I1, N2, A3, N4, E5 -> A in position 3 which is not allowed.

Another: ""DAINY""? not common; ""DAINT""?

Let's list: 
- ""BASIN"" seems good: B, A, S, I, N -> positions: B1, A2, S3, I4, N5
- ""SATIN"": S1, A2, T3, I4, N5
- ""RAPIN""? R is absent, no.

""TAXIN""? not a word.

""VALID"" doesn't end with N.

""MANIA"" ends with A, not N.

A word: ""VAGINA"" is 6 letters? Too long.

We need 5-letter words.

""MAVIE""? not a word.

""OCTAN"" doesn't have I.

Back to ""BASIN"" and ""SATIN"". Which one to choose?

We can choose one that tests new common letters. We have not tested S, T, B, etc.

S is a very common letter, so testing S might be good.

Similarly, T is common.

But note: We have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3. So we need to make progress.

Another idea: Since N is fixed at the end, and A and I are present, we might guess based on common patterns.

We also have position 3 to cover: in both ""BASIN"" and ""SATIN"", we have a new letter in position 3: S or T.

But in ""SATIN"", T is in position 3. We don't have I for position 3? Actually I cannot be in position 3, so it's good we don't put any known letter that shouldn't be there.

But we are putting unknowns.

We might also consider if there are other words.

Another word: ""CHAIN"" invalid because C.

""FAINT"" -> F,A,I,N,T: ends with T? No: F1, A2, I3, N4, T5 -> but we need to end with N? So not.

""PASTE"" doesn't end with N.

What about ""CAMEO"" no.

Perhaps ""KITAN""? not common.

I think ""JUICE"" doesn't end with N.

So common words ending with N and containing A and I: 
""TIBIA"" ends with A? Not N.

""BITTY"" no.

Well, ""SATIN"" and ""BASIN"" are common enough.

But let's check a dictionary: Yes, both are valid.

Another option: ""DEVIL"" doesn't end with N? Not.

Or ""MINUS"" ends with S.

""SATIN"" means a type of fabric.

I'll go with ""SATIN"" because S and T are common to test.

But we can also consider ""PIANO"": 
""PIANO"": P1,I2,A3,N4,O5? 
But wait, it ends with O? Not N. And N is supposed to be in position 5? But ""PIANO"" has N in position 4. So no.

We need the ending letter to be N.

So back to ""SATIN"": S, A, T, I, N -> S1, A2, T3, I4, N5.

This satisfies:
- A is in position 2 (which is allowed: yes, position 2 is okay).
- I is in position 4 (which is allowed: I can be in 1,2, or 4? Yes).
- N in position 5: good.
- No absent letters.

Similarly, ""BASIN"": B, A, S, I, N -> B1, A2, S3, I4, N5.

Both are viable.

But in ""SATIN"", we test T which might be more common than B? Or we can test.

But note: we have a constraint from the first guess: A is in the word but not in position 3, and N not in position 4. In this guess, we have A in position 2 and N in position 5 (which is fine). There might be no additional constraints.

Also, in the second guess, we had no other correct positions except N.

Since we are testing, I'll choose ""SATIN"" as it uses S and T, both common letters.

So our guess: ""SATIN""

We can then see feedback to know about S, T, A and I positions.

But note: if S is the first letter and it's present, we'll know its position, etc.

So, to maximize information, ""SATIN"" is fine.

To be systematic:

Another word: ""QUAINT"" -> 6 letters? No.

""GRAIN"" -> R absent? No.

""AWING"" ends with G? And G is absent? G is absent, so cannot have G.

""IAMBI"" not standard and ends with I? Not N.

I think ""SATIN"" is a good choice.

Let's try ""PAINS"" -> ends with S? Not N.

So, I'll go with ""SATIN"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, E, L, G (cannot be in the word).
- **Present letters**: A, I, N.
- **Position constraints**:
  - N is confirmed in position 5 (✓ from guess 2).
  - A is present but not in position 1 (from guess 2) or 3 (from guess 1), so must be in position 2 or 4.
  - I is present but not in position 3 (from guess 2), so must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- The secret word ends with N and contains both A and I.

Given these constraints, the word ""SATIN"" is a suitable guess:
- S in position 1 (untested).
- A in position 2 (allowed position for A).
- T in position 3 (untested).
- I in position 4 (allowed position for I).
- N in position 5 (confirmed correct).
- No absent letters are used, and it tests new common letters (S, T) to gather more information about the secret word.

- N is in the word and in the correct position, which is position 5 (since in ""align"", N is the last letter).

So, summarizing what we know:

1. Absent letters: C, R, E, L, G (so we must avoid these).
2. Present letters:
   - A: present, but not in position 1 (from guess 2) and not in position 3 (from guess 1). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.
   - I: present, but not in position 3 (from guess 2). So I could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
   - N: present and fixed in position 5 (because we got a ✓ for N in position 5 in guess 2). So N is the last letter.

Since N is in position 5, the secret word is _ _ _ _ N.

We have A and I present, and they are not in certain positions.

We also know that the word has at least three letters: A, I, N (since N is fixed at the end).

We have two more positions (1,2,3,4) but note that position 5 is N. So positions 1-4 are to be filled, but we know A and I are two of the letters, and there might be two more letters we haven't discovered yet.

We have tested and discarded several letters: C, R, E, L, G.

We have two absent letters from guess 2: L and G.

So total absent: C, R, E, L, G.

We need to choose a word that:
- Ends with N (position 5)
- Contains A and I (since we know they are present)
- Does not contain any of C, R, E, L, G.
- A cannot be in position 1 or 3 (from feedback) -> so A must be in position 2 or 4.
- I cannot be in position 3 (from guess 2) -> so I must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Additionally, we need to test other common letters to find the remaining letters.

We have one more piece of information: in guess 1, A was in position 3 and we got a -, so A is not in 3. Similarly, N was in position 4 and we got a -, but now we know N is in position 5, which is consistent because position 4 was wrong.

Now, since A must be in position 2 or 4, and I must be in position 1, 2, or 4 (but not 3).

We also have to consider that position 3 must be filled by another letter.

Let's think of words ending with N and containing A and I, excluding the absent letters.

Common possibilities: 
- Words like _ _ _ A N, but A is in position 4? Then I could be in 1 or 2? But I cannot be in position 3.
- Or _ A _ I N, etc.

Let's try to come up with candidate words.

One common word: ""TRAIN"" but R is absent (from feedback), so cannot use R.

Another: ""PLAIN"" but P and L? L is absent and P is untested? Wait, L is absent so we cannot use L.

Absent letters: C, R, E, L, G.

So available letters: let's list the alphabet without these: A,B,D,F,H,I,J,K,M,N,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But we have A, I, N already present.

Now, considering positions:

Position 5: N

Position 4: if we put A there, then we have positions 1,2,3 for I and two other letters.

But I cannot be in position 3? Actually from feedback, I cannot be in position 3? In guess 2, we put I in position 3 and got a '-', meaning I is in the word but not in position 3. So I must be in 1,2, or 4? But position 4 might be taken by A? So if A is in 4, then I must be in 1 or 2.

Similarly, if A is in 2, then I can be in 1,2 (but position 2 would then have both A and I? That's impossible unless the same letter appears twice? But we don't know yet. We know the word has at least A, I, N, but there might be duplicates? Not necessarily.

Actually, A and I are two distinct letters. So they must be in different positions.

Therefore, we have two scenarios:

Scenario 1: A in position 2
Then I must be in position 1 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth position, and position 5 is N. So position 4: if I is there? But it could be.

Scenario 2: A in position 4
Then I must be in position 1 or 2 (since it cannot be in 3).

Also note position 3 needs to be filled by a new letter.

Let's list words ending in N that have A and I, and avoid the absent letters.

Words that end in N with A and I: 
- ""CHAIN"" -> but C and H? C is absent so invalid.
- ""TRAIN"" -> R is absent.
- ""SPAIN"" -> S, P, A, I, N: but S and P are untested? But does it fit?
  - Positions: S(1), P(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)? But we must be careful: 
    - A in position 3? But we know from guess 1 that A is not in position 3! So invalid.
- ""PLAIN"" -> L absent so invalid.
- ""THAIN"" -> not so common? And H untested.
- ""VIZAIN""? not a word.

Another: ""BRINE"" but R and E absent? No.

""ABOUT"" doesn't end with N.

Try ""MAJOR"" doesn't end with N.

""PAINT"" -> P, A, I, N, T. Ending: A,I,N present? 
Positions: P1, A2, I3, N4? But wait, we have position 5 is N? In ""PAINT"", N is in position 4, but we need N in position 5. So words must be ????N, so five letters: position 1,2,3,4,5 with 5=N.

In ""PAINT"", the word is 5 letters but ends with T? Not N.

So we need words that end with 'N'. For example: ""MAIN?"" but only 4 letters.

Full words: ""RAINY"" doesn't end with N.

Words ending in N: -ION, -IAN, etc.

Specific word: ""URBAN"" but U,R,B? R is absent, so no.

""BATON"" ends with N? T-O-N? No, O is in position 4? BATON: B,A,T,O,N -> positions: B1, A2, T3, O4, N5. Now check:
- A in position 2? That's possible because A must be in 2 or 4? Here it is in 2.
- I is supposed to be present? But in ""BATON"", there is no I. But we know I must be in the word. So ""BATON"" doesn't have I. Invalid.

Therefore, we must include I.

Words with I and ending with N: 
- ""OPIUM"" doesn't end with N? Let's think common words.

""ADMIN"" -> A,D,M,I,N: 
- Positions: A1, D2, M3, I4, N5? 
But: A is in position 1? We know from guess 2 that A cannot be in position 1 (because in ""align"" we had A in position 1 and got '-', meaning it isn't there). So A cannot be in 1. Therefore ""ADMIN"" has A in 1 -> invalid.

Another: ""CHAFIN"" not a word.

""PLAIN"" -> has L (absent) so invalid.

""TAMIN"" ? Not common.

""BASIN"" -> B,A,S,I,N: 
- Positions: B1, A2, S3, I4, N5? 
Now check constraints:
- A is in position 2 -> allowed (since A can be in 2 or 4)
- I is in position 4 -> allowed (I can be in 1,2,4; not 3)
- Does not use absent letters: B, S are not in absent list? Absent are C,R,E,L,G. So B and S are okay.
- Word ends with N.

So ""basin"" is a word: meaning like a wash basin.

But does it fit feedback? We haven't tested B and S.

Yes, we should test B and S.

In ""BASIN"":
- Position 1: B (untested)
- Position 2: A -> we know A is present, and position 2 is a new position for A (previously tried 3 and 1). It might be correct?
- Position 3: S (untested)
- Position 4: I -> we know I is present, but previously tried only at position 3 (which was wrong). Position 4 is new for I.
- Position 5: N -> correct and fixed.

Is there a problem? We don't know if B and S are present? That's why we need to test.

Another common word: ""CHAIN"" -> C is absent, invalid.

""MAINS"" -> ends with S, not N? MAINS is S. Not ending with N.

""WAIVIN""? no.

""DIANE""? but ends with E? E is absent anyway? Not valid.

Another: ""SATIN"" -> S,A,T,I,N: ends with N? S-A-T-I-N, actually ""SATIN"" ends with N? Yes: S1, A2, T3, I4, N5.

Similar to ""BASIN"".

Check constraints for ""SATIN"":
- A in position 2 -> allowed.
- I in position 4 -> allowed.
- T in position 3 -> we haven't tested T.
- Does not use absent letters: S,T are not in the absent list.

So ""SATIN"" and ""BASIN"" are similar.

We could also consider ""INANE""? But I in position 1?, A in position 3? But A cannot be in position 3! From guess 1, A is not in position 3.

In ""INANE"": I1, N2, A3, N4, E5 -> A in position 3 which is not allowed.

Another: ""DAINY""? not common; ""DAINT""?

Let's list: 
- ""BASIN"" seems good: B, A, S, I, N -> positions: B1, A2, S3, I4, N5
- ""SATIN"": S1, A2, T3, I4, N5
- ""RAPIN""? R is absent, no.

""TAXIN""? not a word.

""VALID"" doesn't end with N.

""MANIA"" ends with A, not N.

A word: ""VAGINA"" is 6 letters? Too long.

We need 5-letter words.

""MAVIE""? not a word.

""OCTAN"" doesn't have I.

Back to ""BASIN"" and ""SATIN"". Which one to choose?

We can choose one that tests new common letters. We have not tested S, T, B, etc.

S is a very common letter, so testing S might be good.

Similarly, T is common.

But note: We have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3. So we need to make progress.

Another idea: Since N is fixed at the end, and A and I are present, we might guess based on common patterns.

We also have position 3 to cover: in both ""BASIN"" and ""SATIN"", we have a new letter in position 3: S or T.

But in ""SATIN"", T is in position 3. We don't have I for position 3? Actually I cannot be in position 3, so it's good we don't put any known letter that shouldn't be there.

But we are putting unknowns.

We might also consider if there are other words.

Another word: ""CHAIN"" invalid because C.

""FAINT"" -> F,A,I,N,T: ends with T? No: F1, A2, I3, N4, T5 -> but we need to end with N? So not.

""PASTE"" doesn't end with N.

What about ""CAMEO"" no.

Perhaps ""KITAN""? not common.

I think ""JUICE"" doesn't end with N.

So common words ending with N and containing A and I: 
""TIBIA"" ends with A? Not N.

""BITTY"" no.

Well, ""SATIN"" and ""BASIN"" are common enough.

But let's check a dictionary: Yes, both are valid.

Another option: ""DEVIL"" doesn't end with N? Not.

Or ""MINUS"" ends with S.

""SATIN"" means a type of fabric.

I'll go with ""SATIN"" because S and T are common to test.

But we can also consider ""PIANO"": 
""PIANO"": P1,I2,A3,N4,O5? 
But wait, it ends with O? Not N. And N is supposed to be in position 5? But ""PIANO"" has N in position 4. So no.

We need the ending letter to be N.

So back to ""SATIN"": S, A, T, I, N -> S1, A2, T3, I4, N5.

This satisfies:
- A is in position 2 (which is allowed: yes, position 2 is okay).
- I is in position 4 (which is allowed: I can be in 1,2, or 4? Yes).
- N in position 5: good.
- No absent letters.

Similarly, ""BASIN"": B, A, S, I, N -> B1, A2, S3, I4, N5.

Both are viable.

But in ""SATIN"", we test T which might be more common than B? Or we can test.

But note: we have a constraint from the first guess: A is in the word but not in position 3, and N not in position 4. In this guess, we have A in position 2 and N in position 5 (which is fine). There might be no additional constraints.

Also, in the second guess, we had no other correct positions except N.

Since we are testing, I'll choose ""SATIN"" as it uses S and T, both common letters.

So our guess: ""SATIN""

We can then see feedback to know about S, T, A and I positions.

But note: if S is the first letter and it's present, we'll know its position, etc.

So, to maximize information, ""SATIN"" is fine.

To be systematic:

Another word: ""QUAINT"" -> 6 letters? No.

""GRAIN"" -> R absent? No.

""AWING"" ends with G? And G is absent? G is absent, so cannot have G.

""IAMBI"" not standard and ends with I? Not N.

I think ""SATIN"" is a good choice.

Let's try ""PAINS"" -> ends with S? Not N.

So, I'll go with ""SATIN"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent letters**: C, R, E, L, G (cannot be in the word).
- **Present letters**: A, I, N.
- **Position constraints**:
  - N is confirmed in position 5 (✓ from guess 2).
  - A is present but not in position 1 (from guess 2) or 3 (from guess 1), so must be in position 2 or 4.
  - I is present but not in position 3 (from guess 2), so must be in position 1, 2, or 4.
- The secret word ends with N and contains both A and I.

Given these constraints, the word ""SATIN"" is a suitable guess:
- S in position 1 (untested).
- A in position 2 (allowed position for A).
- T in position 3 (untested).
- I in position 4 (allowed position for I).
- N in position 5 (confirmed correct).
- No absent letters are used, and it tests new common letters (S, T) to gather more information about the secret word.",Guess 3: satin -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) T(✓) I(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
