We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

So we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

Therefore, the word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We also know that the word does not contain C, A, or N.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to use other common letters to uncover more information.

We know the word has R in the second position and E at the end. We need to find the first, third, and fourth letters.

We should avoid using C, A, N.

Common vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U (but we already tried A and E, and E is in). We also have E at the end, so the word might have another vowel? We don't know.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that has:
- First position: a new vowel or consonant (but not C, A, N)
- Third position: a vowel? (since we have R and then a letter, then two more and then E)
- Fourth position: a consonant?

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ E and that don't contain C, A, N.

But note: we are not required to guess a word that fits the pattern exactly because we are still in the process of gathering information. We can guess a word that doesn't fit the pattern to test other letters.

However, if we can guess a word that fits the pattern and tests new letters, that would be ideal.

But we don't know the first, third, and fourth letters. So we can try a word that has R in the second position and E at the end, and uses new letters for the other positions.

Possible words: 
- PRIDE: P, R, I, D, E -> but we don't know if P, I, D are in the word.
- BRINE: but B is new, but we have N which is excluded (from previous feedback, N is not in the word) so we cannot use BRINE because it has N.
- TRIPE: T, R, I, P, E -> T, I, P are new and we avoid C, A, N.

But let's check: TRIPE: T (first), R (second, correct), I (third), P (fourth), E (fifth, correct). This uses T, I, P which are new and not excluded.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have E at the end to test other positions? But we know E is at the end, so if we put E in a different position, we might get a '-' if it's present elsewhere? But the feedback for E in the first guess was in the fifth position and correct, so E is only in the fifth position? Not necessarily, it could be elsewhere too? The feedback only tells us about the positions we guessed.

In the first guess, we had E at the fifth position and it was correct. But the word might have another E? However, we don't know. But the feedback for E was a check, meaning it is in the word and in that position. It doesn't say anything about other E's.

But in the feedback, we only get information about the letters we guessed. So if the word has two E's, we wouldn't know until we guess an E in another position.

But for now, we know at least one E is at the end.

So, for the second guess, we can try to use a word that has E in the fifth position and R in the second, and new letters elsewhere.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ _ E and don't have C, A, N:

- GRIME: G, R, I, M, E
- PRICE: but C is excluded, so no.
- BRIDE: B, R, I, D, E
- TRITE: T, R, I, T, E -> but T is repeated, might be less informative.
- DRIVE: D, R, I, V, E
- WRITE: W, R, I, T, E

We want to test as many new letters as possible. We have not tried: B, D, G, I, M, P, T, V, W, etc.

I think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate: it uses W, R, I, T, E. We know R and E are in the word and in the correct positions. We are testing W, I, T.

Similarly, ""DRIVE"" tests D, I, V.

But note: we are not limited to words that have R and E in the correct positions? We can guess a word without R in the second or E in the fifth? But that might not be efficient because we know R must be in the second and E in the fifth. If we put R elsewhere, we might get a '-' if it's present, but we already know it's in the second. Similarly for E.

But if we put R in a different position, we might get a '-' for R in that position? But we know the word has R in the second, so if we put R in the first, it would be wrong and we might get a '-' if there is another R? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters.

However, to maximize information, it might be better to avoid putting known letters in positions we know they are not? But we don't know about duplicates.

Alternatively, we can stick to the pattern and test new letters.

I think ""WRITE"" is a good guess because:
- It has W (new), R (correct), I (new), T (new), E (correct).
- We can see if W, I, T are in the word and in which positions.

Similarly, ""PRIDE"" (P, R, I, D, E) is also good.

But let's choose one. I'll go with ""WRITE"".

So, second guess: WRITE

But note: we are not forced to use the pattern. We could also try a word that doesn't have R in the second or E in the fifth to test for other letters? But that might be less efficient because we are not using the known information.

For example, if we guess a word without R in the second, then we might get a '-' for R in a different position, which would tell us if there is another R? But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

But since we have limited guesses, it's better to focus on the known pattern and test new letters.

I think ""WRITE"" is a reasonable choice.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has a different set of letters to cover more common ones. For example, we haven't tried S, L, O, etc.

But in ""WRITE"", we are testing W, I, T. W is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.

How about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E -> tests P, I, D.

Or ""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> tests B, I, D.

But we don't know if B, I, D are in the word.

Another common word: ""TRICE"" but C is excluded.

""ROUSE"": but R is in the first position? We need R in the second? Actually, in ""ROUSE"", R is first, but we know R is second in the target. So if we guess ""ROUSE"", we would have:
- R in first: if the word has R only in the second, then R in first would be marked as not in the word? No, the feedback would be: R is in the word but in the wrong position (because the target has R in second, so R is present) so we would get a '-' for R? But we already know R is in the word. So it doesn't give new information about R. Similarly, we know E is in the fifth, but if we put E in the fourth? Then we might get a '-' for E if it is also elsewhere? But we don't know.

So to avoid confusion, it's better to keep R in the second and E in the fifth and test the other positions.

Therefore, I'll go with ""PRIDE"".

But let me see: we have to avoid C, A, N. ""PRIDE"" has P, R, I, D, E. All new.

Similarly, ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.

I think ""PRIDE"" is a good choice.

But let me think of the most common letters. After vowels, common consonants are T, S, L, R (we have R), D, etc.

So including T and D might be good.

""TRIDE"" is not a word. ""BRIDE"" is a word: B, R, I, D, E.

Or ""GRIDE"" is not common. ""PRIDE"" is common.

But ""PRIDE"" doesn't have T. How about ""TRIPE""? T, R, I, P, E.

""TRIPE"" is a word (meaning a part of the stomach of an animal, or to rip off? but it's valid).

But ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.

Alternatively, ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E.

I think I'll go with ""PRIDE"" because it's a common word.

But let me check: we are testing P, I, D. We already know R and E are in place.

So, second guess: PRIDE

But note: we are not sure if the word has I or D or P. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has S, because S is very common. But we cannot put S in the second or fifth? We can put S in the first, third, or fourth.

For example, ""RICES"" but C is excluded and S at the end? But we have E at the end, so we cannot have S at the end. The pattern is _ R _ _ E, so the fourth letter is before E. So we can have S in the first, third, or fourth.

But we don't have a word that fits and has S? For example, ""RUSHE"" is not a word. ""ARISE"" but A is excluded. ""ERASE"" but E is at the beginning? And A is excluded? ""ERASE"" has A, which is excluded.

""RISE"" is only 4 letters. ""PRISE"" is a word: P, R, I, S, E -> but that fits: _ R _ _ E -> PRISE: P (first), R (second), I (third), S (fourth), E (fifth). And it has S.

But we don't know if S is in the word. And we avoid A, C, N? PRISE: P, R, I, S, E. No A, C, N.

So ""PRISE"" is a valid guess and it tests P, I, S.

S is more common than D? So maybe ""PRISE"" is better than ""PRIDE"".

Similarly, ""BRISE"" is not a word.

So I think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: PRISE is a word? It means to force open or a lever, but it's accepted in word games.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" but A is excluded.

So, I'll go with ""PRISE"".

But we have to decide.

Another common word: ""TRICE"" is invalid because of C.

""ROUTE"" but O is new, but R is in first? We need R in second.

I think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.

But let me see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can use ""TRITE"" but it has T repeated? Not ideal.

I think ""PRISE"" is a solid choice.

So, second guess: PRISE

But note: we are not required to use the pattern? But it's efficient.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have R in the second to test for other letters? But that might waste the known information.

I think sticking to the pattern is better.

So, I'll go with ""PRISE"".

But let me think of the word list. Is ""PRISE"" common? It might be less common than ""PRIDE"", but it's valid.

Another option: ""BRINE"" but N is excluded, so no.

""CRIME"" but C is excluded.

""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> tests D, I, V.

V is less common.

""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> tests W, I, T.

W is less common.

So among the options, ""PRISE"" (with S) or ""PRIDE"" (with D) or ""TRIPE"" (with T and P).

I think S is more common than D or T? Actually, T is more common than S? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have E and R, and we've excluded A, N, C. So we haven't tried I, O, T, S, L.

So we should try to cover I, O, T, S, L.

In one guess, we can test multiple.

In ""PRISE"", we test P, I, S. We are missing O, T, L.

In ""TRIPE"", we test T, I, P. Missing O, S, L.

In ""TOILE"" but O and I, but T in first? And we need R in second? Not matching.

We can't cover all in one guess.

But we can try to cover as many as possible.

Another word: ""ROLES"" but R is first? We need R second. If we guess ""ROLES"", we get:
- R: if the word has R only in second, then R in first would be marked as '-' (wrong position) and we already know R is in the word, so it doesn't help. Similarly, E is at the end? But we have E in fifth? In ""ROLES"", E is fourth? So we might get information about E? But we know E is in fifth, so if we put E in fourth, we might get a '-' if there is another E? But we don't know.

But to test more common letters, we could guess a word that has O, T, S, L, and avoid known bad letters.

For example, ""SLATE"" but A is excluded and we have E at the end? But in ""SLATE"", E is fifth, which is correct. But A is excluded, so we cannot use ""SLATE"".

""SLOPE"": S, L, O, P, E -> E at the end is correct. But we don't have R in the second? So we are not using the known R position.

But we can test S, L, O, P. And we know E is at the end.

But we are not testing the first, third, and fourth positions of the pattern? We are testing a completely different word.

This might be acceptable because we can get information about S, L, O, P.

But we know the word has R in the second position, so if we don't include R in the guess, we won't get information about other positions of R? But we already know R is in the word and in the second position, so if we don't include R, we don't learn anything new about R. But we are testing other letters.

However, we have only 6 guesses, so we need to balance.

I think for the second guess, it's better to use the known information and test the unknown positions.

Therefore, I'll stick with a word that has R in the second and E in the fifth.

Let me choose ""PRISE"".

So, second guess: PRISE

But to be more confident, let me see if there's a word that includes T and O? But I can't think of one that fits _ R _ _ E without excluded letters.

""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E -> that fits! And O is a common vowel we haven't tried.

""TROPE"" is a word (meaning a recurring theme). And it has T, R, O, P, E. We test T, O, P.

O is a vowel we haven't tried, which is good.

So ""TROPE"" might be better than ""PRISE"" because we test O instead of S, and O is a vowel.

Similarly, we test T and P.

So I think ""TROPE"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TROPE"".

Second guess: TROPE

In summary, we are guessing ""TROPE"" to test T, O, P in the context of the pattern _ R _ _ E.

So, the guess is ""trope"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter) (✓).

This reveals:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E.
- The letters C, A, and N are excluded.
- The second letter is R, and the fifth letter is E.

For the second guess, I need to test new letters to uncover the first, third, and fourth positions. I should prioritize common vowels and consonants not yet tried (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, D) while avoiding C, A, and N. The word ""trope"" fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and includes:
- T (new, tests first position),
- R (known, second position),
- O (new vowel, tests third position),
- P (new, tests fourth position),
- E (known, fifth position).

This guess efficiently tests three new letters (T, O, P) and maintains the known R and E positions, maximizing information gain.

<guess>trope</guess>",trope,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

So we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

Therefore, the word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We also know that the word does not contain C, A, or N.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to use other common letters to uncover more information.

We know the word has R in the second position and E at the end. We need to find the first, third, and fourth letters.

We should avoid using C, A, N.

Common vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U (but we already tried A and E, and E is in). We also have E at the end, so the word might have another vowel? We don't know.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that has:

- Third position: a vowel? (since we have R and then a letter, then two more and then E)
- Fourth position: a consonant?

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ E and that don't contain C, A, N.

But note: we are not required to guess a word that fits the pattern exactly because we are still in the process of gathering information. We can guess a word that doesn't fit the pattern to test other letters.

However, if we can guess a word that fits the pattern and tests new letters, that would be ideal.

But we don't know the first, third, and fourth letters. So we can try a word that has R in the second position and E at the end, and uses new letters for the other positions.

Possible words: 
- PRIDE: P, R, I, D, E -> but we don't know if P, I, D are in the word.
- BRINE: but B is new, but we have N which is excluded (from previous feedback, N is not in the word) so we cannot use BRINE because it has N.
- TRIPE: T, R, I, P, E -> T, I, P are new and we avoid C, A, N.

But let's check: TRIPE: T (first), R (second, correct), I (third), P (fourth), E (fifth, correct). This uses T, I, P which are new and not excluded.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have E at the end to test other positions? But we know E is at the end, so if we put E in a different position, we might get a '-' if it's present elsewhere? But the feedback for E in the first guess was in the fifth position and correct, so E is only in the fifth position? Not necessarily, it could be elsewhere too? The feedback only tells us about the positions we guessed.

In the first guess, we had E at the fifth position and it was correct. But the word might have another E? However, we don't know. But the feedback for E was a check, meaning it is in the word and in that position. It doesn't say anything about other E's.

But in the feedback, we only get information about the letters we guessed. So if the word has two E's, we wouldn't know until we guess an E in another position.

But for now, we know at least one E is at the end.

So, for the second guess, we can try to use a word that has E in the fifth position and R in the second, and new letters elsewhere.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ _ E and don't have C, A, N:

- GRIME: G, R, I, M, E
- PRICE: but C is excluded, so no.
- BRIDE: B, R, I, D, E
- TRITE: T, R, I, T, E -> but T is repeated, might be less informative.
- DRIVE: D, R, I, V, E
- WRITE: W, R, I, T, E

We want to test as many new letters as possible. We have not tried: B, D, G, I, M, P, T, V, W, etc.

I think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate: it uses W, R, I, T, E. We know R and E are in the word and in the correct positions. We are testing W, I, T.

Similarly, ""DRIVE"" tests D, I, V.

But note: we are not limited to words that have R and E in the correct positions? We can guess a word without R in the second or E in the fifth? But that might not be efficient because we know R must be in the second and E in the fifth. If we put R elsewhere, we might get a '-' if it's present, but we already know it's in the second.

But let's choose one. I'll go with ""WRITE"".

So, second guess: WRITE

But note: we are not forced to use the pattern. We could also try a word that doesn't have R in the second or E in the fifth to test for other letters? But that might be less efficient because we are not using the known information.

For example, if we guess a word without R in the second, then we might get a '-' for R in a different position, which would tell us if there is another R? But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

How about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E -> tests P, I, D.

Or ""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> tests B, I, D.

But we don't know if B, I, D are in the word.

Another common word: ""TRICE"" but C is excluded.

""ROUSE"": but R is in the first position? We need R in the second? Actually, in ""ROUSE"", R is first, but we know R is second in the target. So if we guess ""ROUSE"", we would have:
- R in first: if the word has R only in the second, then R in first would be marked as not in the word? No, the feedback would be: R is in the word but in the wrong position (because the target has R in second, so R is present) so we would get a '-' for R? But we already know R is in the word. So it doesn't give new information about R. Similarly, we know E is in the fifth, but if we put E in the fourth? Then we might get a '-' for E if it is also elsewhere? But we don't know.

So to avoid confusion, it's better to keep R in the second and E in the fifth and test the other positions.

Therefore, I'll go with ""PRIDE"".

But let me see: we have to avoid C, A, N. ""PRIDE"" has P, R, I, D, E. All new.

Similarly, ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.

I think ""PRIDE"" is a good choice.

But let me think of the most common letters. After vowels, common consonants are T, S, L, R (we have R), D, etc.

So including T and D might be good.

""TRIDE"" is not a word. ""BRIDE"" is a word: B, R, I, D, E.

Or ""GRIDE"" is not common. ""PRIDE"" is common.

But ""PRIDE"" doesn't have T. How about ""TRIPE""? T, R, I, P, E.

""TRIPE"" is a word (meaning a part of the stomach of an animal, or to rip off? but it's valid).

But ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.

Alternatively, ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E.

I think I'll go with ""PRIDE"" because it's a common word.

But let me check: we are testing P, I, D. We already know R and E are in place.

So, second guess: PRIDE

But note: we are not sure if the word has I or D or P. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has S, because S is very common. But we cannot put S in the second or fifth? We can put S in the first, third, or fourth.

For example, ""RICES"" but C is excluded and S at the end? But we have E at the end, so we cannot have S at the end. The pattern is _ R _ _ E, so the fourth letter is before E. So we can have S in the first, third, or fourth.

But we don't have a word that fits and has S? For example, ""RUSHE"" is not a word. ""ARISE"" but A is excluded. ""ERASE"" but E is at the beginning? And A is excluded? ""ERASE"" has A, which is excluded.

""RISE"" is only 4 letters. ""PRISE"" is a word: P, R, I, S, E -> but that fits: _ R _ _ E -> PRISE: P (first), R (second), I (third), S (fourth), E (fifth). And it has S.

But we don't know if S is in the word. And we avoid A, C, N? PRISE: P, R, I, S, E. No A, C, N.

So ""PRISE"" is a valid guess and it tests P, I, S.

S is more common than D? So maybe ""PRISE"" is better than ""PRIDE"".

Similarly, ""BRISE"" is not a word.

So I think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: PRISE is a word? It means to force open or a lever, but it's accepted in word games.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" but A is excluded.

So, I'll go with ""PRISE"".

But we have to decide.

Another common word: ""TRICE"" is invalid because of C.

""ROUTE"" but O is new, but R is in first? We need R in second.

I think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.

But let me see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can use ""TRITE"" but it has T repeated? Not ideal.

I think ""PRISE"" is a solid choice.

So, second guess: PRISE

But note: we are not required to use the pattern? But it's efficient.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have R in the second to test for other letters? But that might waste the known information.

I think sticking to the pattern is better.

So, I'll go with ""PRISE"".

But let me think of the word list. Is ""PRISE"" common? It might be less common than ""PRIDE"", but it's valid.

Another option: ""BRINE"" but N is excluded, so no.

""CRIME"" but C is excluded.

""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> tests D, I, V.

V is less common.

""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> tests W, I, T.

W is less common.

So among the options, ""PRISE"" (with S) or ""PRIDE"" (with D) or ""TRIPE"" (with T and P).

I think S is more common than D or T? Actually, T is more common than S? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have E and R, and we've excluded A, N, C. So we haven't tried I, O, T, S, L.

So we should try to cover I, O, T, S, L.

In one guess, we can test multiple.

In ""PRISE"", we test P, I, S. We are missing O, T, L.

In ""TRIPE"", we test T, I, P. Missing O, S, L.

In ""TOILE"" but O and I, but T in first? And we need R in second? Not matching.

We can't cover all in one guess.

But we can try to cover as many as possible.

Another word: ""ROLES"" but R is first? We need R second. If we guess ""ROLES"", we get:
- R: if the word has R only in second, then R in first would be marked as '-' (wrong position) and we already know R is in the word, so it doesn't help. Similarly, E is at the end? But we have E in fifth? In ""ROLES"", E is fourth? So we might get information about E? But we know E is in fifth, so if we put E in fourth, we might get a '-' if there is another E? But we don't know.

But to test more common letters, we could guess a word that has O, T, S, L, and avoid known bad letters.

For example, ""SLATE"" but A is excluded and we have E at the end? But in ""SLATE"", E is fifth, which is correct. But A is excluded, so we cannot use ""SLATE"".

""SLOPE"": S, L, O, P, E -> E at the end is correct. But we don't have R in the second? So we are not using the known R position.

But we can test S, L, O, P. And we know E is at the end.

But we are not testing the first, third, and fourth positions of the pattern? We are testing a completely different word.

This might be acceptable because we can get information about S, L, O, P.

But we know the word has R in the second position, so if we don't include R in the guess, we won't get information about other positions of R? But we already know R is in the word and in the second position, so if we don't include R, we don't learn anything new about R. But we are testing other letters.

However, we have only 6 guesses, so we need to balance.

I think for the second guess, it's better to use the known information and test the unknown positions.

Therefore, I'll stick with a word that has R in the second and E in the fifth.

Let me choose ""PRISE"".

So, second guess: PRISE

But to be more confident, let me see if there's a word that includes T and O? But I can't think of one that fits _ R _ _ E without excluded letters.

""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E -> that fits! And O is a common vowel we haven't tried.

""TROPE"" is a word (meaning a recurring theme). And it has T, R, O, P, E. We test T, O, P.

O is a vowel we haven't tried, which is good.

So ""TROPE"" might be better than ""PRISE"" because we test O instead of S, and O is a vowel.

Similarly, we test T and P.

So I think ""TROPE"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TROPE"".

Second guess: TROPE

In summary, we are guessing ""TROPE"" to test T, O, P in the context of the pattern _ R _ _ E.

So, the guess is ""trope"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter) (✓).

This reveals:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E.
- The letters C, A, and N are excluded.
- The second letter is R, and the fifth letter is E.

For the second guess, I need to test new letters to uncover the first, third, and fourth positions. I should prioritize common vowels and consonants not yet tried (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, D) while avoiding C, A, and N. The word ""trope"" fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and includes:
- T (new, tests first position),
- R (known, second position),
- O (new vowel, tests third position),
- P (new, tests fourth position),
- E (known, fifth position).

This guess efficiently tests three new letters (T, O, P) and maintains the known R and E positions, maximizing information gain.",Guess 2: trope -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

So we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

Therefore, the word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We also know that the word does not contain C, A, or N.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to use other common letters to uncover more information.

We know the word has R in the second position and E at the end. We need to find the first, third, and fourth letters.

We should avoid using C, A, N.

Common vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U (but we already tried A and E, and E is in). We also have E at the end, so the word might have another vowel? We don't know.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that has:
- First position: a new vowel or consonant (but not C, A, N)
- Third position: a vowel? (since we have R and then a letter, then two more and then E)
- Fourth position: a consonant?

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ E and that don't contain C, A, N.

But note: we are not required to guess a word that fits the pattern exactly because we are still in the process of gathering information. We can guess a word that doesn't fit the pattern to test other letters.

However, if we can guess a word that fits the pattern and tests new letters, that would be ideal.

But we don't know the first, third, and fourth letters. So we can try a word that has R in the second position and E at the end, and uses new letters for the other positions.

Possible words: 
- PRIDE: P, R, I, D, E -> but we don't know if P, I, D are in the word.
- BRINE: but B is new, but we have N which is excluded (from previous feedback, N is not in the word) so we cannot use BRINE because it has N.
- TRIPE: T, R, I, P, E -> T, I, P are new and we avoid C, A, N.

But let's check: TRIPE: T (first), R (second, correct), I (third), P (fourth), E (fifth, correct). This uses T, I, P which are new and not excluded.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have E at the end to test other positions? But we know E is at the end, so if we put E in a different position, we might get a '-' if it's present elsewhere? But the feedback for E in the first guess was in the fifth position and correct, so E is only in the fifth position? Not necessarily, it could be elsewhere too? The feedback only tells us about the positions we guessed.

In the first guess, we had E at the fifth position and it was correct. But the word might have another E? However, we don't know. But the feedback for E was a check, meaning it is in the word and in that position. It doesn't say anything about other E's.

But in the feedback, we only get information about the letters we guessed. So if the word has two E's, we wouldn't know until we guess an E in another position.

But for now, we know at least one E is at the end.

So, for the second guess, we can try to use a word that has E in the fifth position and R in the second, and new letters elsewhere.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ _ E and don't have C, A, N:

- GRIME: G, R, I, M, E
- PRICE: but C is excluded, so no.
- BRIDE: B, R, I, D, E
- TRITE: T, R, I, T, E -> but T is repeated, might be less informative.
- DRIVE: D, R, I, V, E
- WRITE: W, R, I, T, E

We want to test as many new letters as possible. We have not tried: B, D, G, I, M, P, T, V, W, etc.

I think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate: it uses W, R, I, T, E. We know R and E are in the word and in the correct positions. We are testing W, I, T.

Similarly, ""DRIVE"" tests D, I, V.

But note: we are not limited to words that have R and E in the correct positions? We can guess a word without R in the second or E in the fifth? But that might not be efficient because we know R must be in the second and E in the fifth. If we put R elsewhere, we might get a '-' if it's present, but we already know it's in the second. Similarly for E.

But if we put R in a different position, we might get a '-' for R in that position? But we know the word has R in the second, so if we put R in the first, it would be wrong and we might get a '-' if there is another R? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters.

However, to maximize information, it might be better to avoid putting known letters in positions we know they are not? But we don't know about duplicates.

Alternatively, we can stick to the pattern and test new letters.

I think ""WRITE"" is a good guess because:
- It has W (new), R (correct), I (new), T (new), E (correct).
- We can see if W, I, T are in the word and in which positions.

Similarly, ""PRIDE"" (P, R, I, D, E) is also good.

But let's choose one. I'll go with ""WRITE"".

So, second guess: WRITE

But note: we are not forced to use the pattern. We could also try a word that doesn't have R in the second or E in the fifth to test for other letters? But that might be less efficient because we are not using the known information.

For example, if we guess a word without R in the second, then we might get a '-' for R in a different position, which would tell us if there is another R? But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

But since we have limited guesses, it's better to focus on the known pattern and test new letters.

I think ""WRITE"" is a reasonable choice.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has a different set of letters to cover more common ones. For example, we haven't tried S, L, O, etc.

But in ""WRITE"", we are testing W, I, T. W is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.

How about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E -> tests P, I, D.

Or ""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> tests B, I, D.

But we don't know if B, I, D are in the word.

Another common word: ""TRICE"" but C is excluded.

""ROUSE"": but R is in the first position? We need R in the second? Actually, in ""ROUSE"", R is first, but we know R is second in the target. So if we guess ""ROUSE"", we would have:
- R in first: if the word has R only in the second, then R in first would be marked as not in the word? No, the feedback would be: R is in the word but in the wrong position (because the target has R in second, so R is present) so we would get a '-' for R? But we already know R is in the word. So it doesn't give new information about R. Similarly, we know E is in the fifth, but if we put E in the fourth? Then we might get a '-' for E if it is also elsewhere? But we don't know.

So to avoid confusion, it's better to keep R in the second and E in the fifth and test the other positions.

Therefore, I'll go with ""PRIDE"".

But let me see: we have to avoid C, A, N. ""PRIDE"" has P, R, I, D, E. All new.

Similarly, ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.

I think ""PRIDE"" is a good choice.

But let me think of the most common letters. After vowels, common consonants are T, S, L, R (we have R), D, etc.

So including T and D might be good.

""TRIDE"" is not a word. ""BRIDE"" is a word: B, R, I, D, E.

Or ""GRIDE"" is not common. ""PRIDE"" is common.

But ""PRIDE"" doesn't have T. How about ""TRIPE""? T, R, I, P, E.

""TRIPE"" is a word (meaning a part of the stomach of an animal, or to rip off? but it's valid).

But ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.

Alternatively, ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E.

I think I'll go with ""PRIDE"" because it's a common word.

But let me check: we are testing P, I, D. We already know R and E are in place.

So, second guess: PRIDE

But note: we are not sure if the word has I or D or P. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has S, because S is very common. But we cannot put S in the second or fifth? We can put S in the first, third, or fourth.

For example, ""RICES"" but C is excluded and S at the end? But we have E at the end, so we cannot have S at the end. The pattern is _ R _ _ E, so the fourth letter is before E. So we can have S in the first, third, or fourth.

But we don't have a word that fits and has S? For example, ""RUSHE"" is not a word. ""ARISE"" but A is excluded. ""ERASE"" but E is at the beginning? And A is excluded? ""ERASE"" has A, which is excluded.

""RISE"" is only 4 letters. ""PRISE"" is a word: P, R, I, S, E -> but that fits: _ R _ _ E -> PRISE: P (first), R (second), I (third), S (fourth), E (fifth). And it has S.

But we don't know if S is in the word. And we avoid A, C, N? PRISE: P, R, I, S, E. No A, C, N.

So ""PRISE"" is a valid guess and it tests P, I, S.

S is more common than D? So maybe ""PRISE"" is better than ""PRIDE"".

Similarly, ""BRISE"" is not a word.

So I think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: PRISE is a word? It means to force open or a lever, but it's accepted in word games.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" but A is excluded.

So, I'll go with ""PRISE"".

But we have to decide.

Another common word: ""TRICE"" is invalid because of C.

""ROUTE"" but O is new, but R is in first? We need R in second.

I think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.

But let me see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can use ""TRITE"" but it has T repeated? Not ideal.

I think ""PRISE"" is a solid choice.

So, second guess: PRISE

But note: we are not required to use the pattern? But it's efficient.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have R in the second to test for other letters? But that might waste the known information.

I think sticking to the pattern is better.

So, I'll go with ""PRISE"".

But let me think of the word list. Is ""PRISE"" common? It might be less common than ""PRIDE"", but it's valid.

Another option: ""BRINE"" but N is excluded, so no.

""CRIME"" but C is excluded.

""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> tests D, I, V.

V is less common.

""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> tests W, I, T.

W is less common.

So among the options, ""PRISE"" (with S) or ""PRIDE"" (with D) or ""TRIPE"" (with T and P).

I think S is more common than D or T? Actually, T is more common than S? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have E and R, and we've excluded A, N, C. So we haven't tried I, O, T, S, L.

So we should try to cover I, O, T, S, L.

In one guess, we can test multiple.

In ""PRISE"", we test P, I, S. We are missing O, T, L.

In ""TRIPE"", we test T, I, P. Missing O, S, L.

In ""TOILE"" but O and I, but T in first? And we need R in second? Not matching.

We can't cover all in one guess.

But we can try to cover as many as possible.

Another word: ""ROLES"" but R is first? We need R second. If we guess ""ROLES"", we get:
- R: if the word has R only in second, then R in first would be marked as '-' (wrong position) and we already know R is in the word, so it doesn't help. Similarly, E is at the end? But we have E in fifth? In ""ROLES"", E is fourth? So we might get information about E? But we know E is in fifth, so if we put E in fourth, we might get a '-' if there is another E? But we don't know.

But to test more common letters, we could guess a word that has O, T, S, L, and avoid known bad letters.

For example, ""SLATE"" but A is excluded and we have E at the end? But in ""SLATE"", E is fifth, which is correct. But A is excluded, so we cannot use ""SLATE"".

""SLOPE"": S, L, O, P, E -> E at the end is correct. But we don't have R in the second? So we are not using the known R position.

But we can test S, L, O, P. And we know E is at the end.

But we are not testing the first, third, and fourth positions of the pattern? We are testing a completely different word.

This might be acceptable because we can get information about S, L, O, P.

But we know the word has R in the second position, so if we don't include R in the guess, we won't get information about other positions of R? But we already know R is in the word and in the second position, so if we don't include R, we don't learn anything new about R. But we are testing other letters.

However, we have only 6 guesses, so we need to balance.

I think for the second guess, it's better to use the known information and test the unknown positions.

Therefore, I'll stick with a word that has R in the second and E in the fifth.

Let me choose ""PRISE"".

So, second guess: PRISE

But to be more confident, let me see if there's a word that includes T and O? But I can't think of one that fits _ R _ _ E without excluded letters.

""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E -> that fits! And O is a common vowel we haven't tried.

""TROPE"" is a word (meaning a recurring theme). And it has T, R, O, P, E. We test T, O, P.

O is a vowel we haven't tried, which is good.

So ""TROPE"" might be better than ""PRISE"" because we test O instead of S, and O is a vowel.

Similarly, we test T and P.

So I think ""TROPE"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TROPE"".

Second guess: TROPE

In summary, we are guessing ""TROPE"" to test T, O, P in the context of the pattern _ R _ _ E.

So, the guess is ""trope"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter) (✓).

This reveals:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E.
- The letters C, A, and N are excluded.
- The second letter is R, and the fifth letter is E.

For the second guess, I need to test new letters to uncover the first, third, and fourth positions. I should prioritize common vowels and consonants not yet tried (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, D) while avoiding C, A, and N. The word ""trope"" fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and includes:
- T (new, tests first position),
- R (known, second position),
- O (new vowel, tests third position),
- P (new, tests fourth position),
- E (known, fifth position).

This guess efficiently tests three new letters (T, O, P) and maintains the known R and E positions, maximizing information gain.

We should try to use other common letters to uncover more information.\n\nWe know the word has R in the second position and E at the end. We need to find the first, third, and fourth letters.\n\nWe should avoid using C, A, N.\n\nCommon vowels we haven\'t tried: O, I, U (but we already tried A and E, and E is in). We also have E at the end, so the word might have another vowel? We don\'t know.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try a word that has:\n- First position: a new vowel or consonant (but not C, A, N)\n- Third position: a vowel? (since we have R and then a letter, then two more and then E)\n- Fourth position: a consonant?\n\nWe also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ E and that don\'t contain C, A, N.\n\nBut note: we are not required to guess a word that fits the pattern exactly because we are still in the process of gathering information. We can guess a word that doesn\'t fit the pattern to test other letters.\n\nHowever, if we can guess a word that fits the pattern and tests new letters, that would be ideal.\n\nBut we don\'t know the first, third, and fourth letters. So we can try a word that has R in the second position and E at the end, and uses new letters for the other positions.\n\nPossible words: \n- PRIDE: P, R, I, D, E -> but we don\'t know if P, I, D are in the word.\n- BRINE: but B is new, but we have N which is excluded (from previous feedback, N is not in the word) so we cannot use BRINE because it has N.\n- TRIPE: T, R, I, P, E -> T, I, P are new and we avoid C, A, N.\n\nBut let\'s check: TRIPE: T (first), R (second, correct), I (third), P (fourth), E (fifth, correct). This uses T, I, P which are new and not excluded.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t have E at the end to test other positions? But we know E is at the end, so if we put E in a different position, we might get a \'-\' if it\'s present elsewhere? But the feedback for E in the first guess was in the fifth position and correct, so E is only in the fifth position? Not necessarily, it could be elsewhere too? The feedback only tells us about the positions we guessed.\n\nIn the first guess, we had E at the fifth position and it was correct. But the word might have another E? However, we don\'t know. But the feedback for E was a check, meaning it is in the word and in that position. It doesn\'t say anything about other E\'s.\n\nBut in the feedback, we only get information about the letters we guessed. So if the word has two E\'s, we wouldn\'t know until we guess an E in another position.\n\nBut for now, we know at least one E is at the end.\n\nSo, for the second guess, we can try to use a word that has E in the fifth position and R in the second, and new letters elsewhere.\n\nLet me list some words that fit _ R _ _ E and don\'t have C, A, N:\n\n- GRIME: G, R, I, M, E\n- PRICE: but C is excluded, so no.\n- BRIDE: B, R, I, D, E\n- TRITE: T, R, I, T, E -> but T is repeated, might be less informative.\n- DRIVE: D, R, I, V, E\n- WRITE: W, R, I, T, E\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible. We have not tried: B, D, G, I, M, P, T, V, W, etc.\n\nI think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate: it uses W, R, I, T, E. We know R and E are in the word and in the correct positions. We are testing W, I, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""DRIVE"" tests D, I, V.\n\nBut note: we are not limited to words that have R and E in the correct positions? We can guess a word without R in the second or E in the fifth? But that might not be efficient because we know R must be in the second and E in the fifth. If we put R elsewhere, we might get a \'-\' if it\'s present, but we already know it\'s in the second. Similarly for E.\n\nBut if we put R in a different position, we might get a \'-\' for R in that position? But we know the word has R in the second, so if we put R in the first, it would be wrong and we might get a \'-\' if there is another R? But we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters.\n\nHowever, to maximize information, it might be better to avoid putting known letters in positions we know they are not? But we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, we can stick to the pattern and test new letters.\n\nI think ""WRITE"" is a good guess because:\n- It has W (new), R (correct), I (new), T (new), E (correct).\n- We can see if W, I, T are in the word and in which positions.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRIDE"" (P, R, I, D, E) is also good.\n\nBut let\'s choose one. I\'ll go with ""WRITE"".\n\nSo, second guess: WRITE\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use the pattern. We could also try a word that doesn\'t have R in the second or E in the fifth to test for other letters? But that might be less efficient because we are not using the known information.\n\nFor example, if we guess a word without R in the second, then we might get a \'-\' for R in a different position, which would tell us if there is another R? But we don\'t know if there is a duplicate.\n\nBut since we have limited guesses, it\'s better to focus on the known pattern and test new letters.\n\nI think ""WRITE"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that has a different set of letters to cover more common ones. For example, we haven\'t tried S, L, O, etc.\n\nBut in ""WRITE"", we are testing W, I, T. W is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.\n\nHow about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E -> tests P, I, D.\n\nOr ""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> tests B, I, D.\n\nBut we don\'t know if B, I, D are in the word.\n\nAnother common word: ""TRICE"" but C is excluded.\n\n""ROUSE"": but R is in the first position? We need R in the second? Actually, in ""ROUSE"", R is first, but we know R is second in the target. So if we guess ""ROUSE"", we would have:\n- R in first: if the word has R only in the second, then R in first would be marked as not in the word? No, the feedback would be: R is in the word but in the wrong position (because the target has R in second, so R is present) so we would get a \'-\' for R? But we already know R is in the word. So it doesn\'t give new information about R. Similarly, we know E is in the fifth, but if we put E in the fourth? Then we might get a \'-\' for E if it is also elsewhere? But we don\'t know.\n\nSo to avoid confusion, it\'s better to keep R in the second and E in the fifth and test the other positions.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""PRIDE"".\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid C, A, N. ""PRIDE"" has P, R, I, D, E. All new.\n\nSimilarly, ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.\n\nI think ""PRIDE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me think of the most common letters. After vowels, common consonants are T, S, L, R (we have R), D, etc.\n\nSo including T and D might be good.\n\n""TRIDE"" is not a word. ""BRIDE"" is a word: B, R, I, D, E.\n\nOr ""GRIDE"" is not common. ""PRIDE"" is common.\n\nBut ""PRIDE"" doesn\'t have T. How about ""TRIPE""? T, R, I, P, E.\n\n""TRIPE"" is a word (meaning a part of the stomach of an animal, or to rip off? but it\'s valid).\n\nBut ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.\n\nAlternatively, ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""PRIDE"" because it\'s a common word.\n\nBut let me check: we are testing P, I, D. We already know R and E are in place.\n\nSo, second guess: PRIDE\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has I or D or P. We are testing them.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that has S, because S is very common. But we cannot put S in the second or fifth? We can put S in the first, third, or fourth.\n\nFor example, ""RICES"" but C is excluded and S at the end? But we have E at the end, so we cannot have S at the end. The pattern is _ R _ _ E, so the fourth letter is before E. So we can have S in the first, third, or fourth.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that fits and has S? For example, ""RUSHE"" is not a word. ""ARISE"" but A is excluded. ""ERASE"" but E is at the beginning? And A is excluded? ""ERASE"" has A, which is excluded.\n\n""RISE"" is only 4 letters. ""PRISE"" is a word: P, R, I, S, E -> but that fits: _ R _ _ E -> PRISE: P (first), R (second), I (third), S (fourth), E (fifth). And it has S.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S is in the word. And we avoid A, C, N? PRISE: P, R, I, S, E. No A, C, N.\n\nSo ""PRISE"" is a valid guess and it tests P, I, S.\n\nS is more common than D? So maybe ""PRISE"" is better than ""PRIDE"".\n\nSimilarly, ""BRISE"" is not a word.\n\nSo I think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: PRISE is a word? It means to force open or a lever, but it\'s accepted in word games.\n\nAlternatively, ""RAISE"" but A is excluded.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PRISE"".\n\nBut we have to decide.\n\nAnother common word: ""TRICE"" is invalid because of C.\n\n""ROUTE"" but O is new, but R is in first? We need R in second.\n\nI think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""TRITE"" but it has T repeated? Not ideal.\n\nI think ""PRISE"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo, second guess: PRISE\n\nBut note: we are not required to use the pattern? But it\'s efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that doesn\'t have R in the second to test for other letters? But that might waste the known information.\n\nI think sticking to the pattern is better.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PRISE"".\n\nBut let me think of the word list. Is ""PRISE"" common? It might be less common than ""PRIDE"", but it\'s valid.\n\nAnother option: ""BRINE"" but N is excluded, so no.\n\n""CRIME"" but C is excluded.\n\n""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> tests D, I, V.\n\nV is less common.\n\n""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> tests W, I, T.\n\nW is less common.\n\nSo among the options, ""PRISE"" (with S) or ""PRIDE"" (with D) or ""TRIPE"" (with T and P).\n\nI think S is more common than D or T? Actually, T is more common than S? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have E and R, and we\'ve excluded A, N, C. So we haven\'t tried I, O, T, S, L.\n\nSo we should try to cover I, O, T, S, L.\n\nIn one guess, we can test multiple.\n\nIn ""PRISE"", we test P, I, S. We are missing O, T, L.\n\nIn ""TRIPE"", we test T, I, P. Missing O, S, L.\n\nIn ""TOILE"" but O and I, but T in first? And we need R in second? Not matching.\n\nWe can\'t cover all in one guess.\n\nBut we can try to cover as many as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""ROLES"" but R is first? We need R second. If we guess ""ROLES"", we get:\n- R: if the word has R only in second, then R in first would be marked as \'-\' (wrong position) and we already know R is in the word, so it doesn\'t help. Similarly, E is at the end? But we have E in fifth? In ""ROLES"", E is fourth? So we might get information about E? But we know E is in fifth, so if we put E in fourth, we might get a \'-\' if there is another E? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to test more common letters, we could guess a word that has O, T, S, L, and avoid known bad letters.\n\nFor example, ""SLATE"" but A is excluded and we have E at the end? But in ""SLATE"", E is fifth, which is correct. But A is excluded, so we cannot use ""SLATE"".\n\n""SLOPE"": S, L, O, P, E -> E at the end is correct. But we don\'t have R in the second? So we are not using the known R position.\n\nBut we can test S, L, O, P. And we know E is at the end.\n\nBut we are not testing the first, third, and fourth positions of the pattern? We are testing a completely different word.\n\nThis might be acceptable because we can get information about S, L, O, P.\n\nBut we know the word has R in the second position, so if we don\'t include R in the guess, we won\'t get information about other positions of R? But we already know R is in the word and in the second position, so if we don\'t include R, we don\'t learn anything new about R. But we are testing other letters.\n\nHowever, we have only 6 guesses, so we need to balance.\n\nI think for the second guess, it\'s better to use the known information and test the unknown positions.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll stick with a word that has R in the second and E in the fifth.\n\nLet me choose ""PRISE"".\n\nSo, second guess: PRISE\n\nBut to be more confident, let me see if there\'s a word that includes T and O? But I can\'t think of one that fits _ R _ _ E without excluded letters.\n\n""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E -> that fits! And O is a common vowel we haven\'t tried.\n\n""TROPE"" is a word (meaning a recurring theme). And it has T, R, O, P, E. We test T, O, P.\n\nO is a vowel we haven\'t tried, which is good.\n\nSo ""TROPE"" might be better than ""PRISE"" because we test O instead of S, and O is a vowel.\n\nSimilarly, we test T and P.\n\nSo I think ""TROPE"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""TROPE"".\n\nSecond guess: TROPE\n\nIn summary, we are guessing ""TROPE"" to test T, O, P in the context of the pattern _ R _ _ E.\n\nSo, the guess is ""trope"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is not in the word (x).\n- R is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).\n- A is not in the word (x).\n- N is not in the word (x).\n- E is in the correct position (fifth letter) (✓).\n\nThis reveals:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E.\n- The letters C, A, and N are excluded.\n- The second letter is R, and the fifth letter is E.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to test new letters to uncover the first, third, and fourth positions. I should prioritize common vowels and consonants not yet tried (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, D) while avoiding C, A, and N. The word ""trope"" fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and includes:\n- T (new, tests first position),\n- R (known, second position),\n- O (new vowel, tests third position),\n- P (new, tests fourth position),\n- E (known, fifth position).\n\nThis guess efficiently tests three new letters (T, O, P) and maintains the known R and E positions, maximizing information gain.\n\n<guess>trope</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: trope -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

Guess 2: ""trope""
- T: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so O is the third letter)
- P: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

From this, we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R O _ E
- The second letter is R, third is O, fifth is E.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, P (from the x's)
- We also know that O is in the third position and is correct.

So the word is of the form: _ R O _ E

We need to find the first and fourth letters.

We have excluded: C, A, N, T, P.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, P.

Remaining common letters: We should try to use common consonants and vowels that haven't been tried. We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid 5-letter word.

The first letter: it must be a letter not excluded, so not C, A, N, T, P.

The fourth letter: similarly, not excluded.

We know the word has R, O, E, and two more letters.

We can think of words that fit _ R O _ E.

Possible words:
- PROBE: but P is excluded, so no.
- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E -> G and V are new.
- DROVE: D, R, O, V, E -> D and V new.
- PROSE: P excluded.
- ROUTE: but U is in fourth? And T is excluded? T is excluded, so no.
- BROKE: B, R, O, K, E -> B and K new.
- FROZE: F, R, O, Z, E -> F and Z new.
- GROPE: P excluded.
- TROVE: T excluded.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

So, let's list possible words:
- GROVE
- DROVE
- BROKE
- FROZE
- Also, ""WROTE"": but T is excluded, so no.
- ""BRIDE"": but I is in third? We need O in third. Pattern is _ R O _ E, so third must be O.

Another one: ""AROSE"" but A is excluded.

""CRONE"" but C excluded.

""DRONE"": D, R, O, N, E -> but N is excluded? From guess 1, N is not in the word, so no.

""PRONE"": P excluded.

""TRONE"": T excluded.

""SHONE"": S, H, O, N, E -> but N excluded.

""PHONE"": P and N excluded.

""SCONE"": S, C, O, N, E -> C and N excluded.

So, back to:
- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E
- DROVE: D, R, O, V, E
- BROKE: B, R, O, K, E
- FROZE: F, R, O, Z, E
- Also, ""TRODE"": but T excluded? TRODE has T, so no.
- ""BROME"": B, R, O, M, E -> is that a word? Brome is a type of grass, I think it's valid.
- ""GROPE"": P excluded.
- ""CRORE"": C excluded.

Another one: ""PROLE"": P excluded.

""WROTE"": T excluded.

""WROKE"": not common, and W is first? But we can check.

But let's focus on common words.

We also have ""IRONE"": but I is first? And N excluded? No.

""GRACE"": C and A excluded.

So, possible candidates: GROVE, DROVE, BROKE, FROZE, and BROME.

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have to guess one of these, but we don't know which one. We can use a guess that includes letters that are common to narrow down.

But we have only one position unknown? Actually, two positions: first and fourth.

We know the pattern: first letter and fourth letter are missing.

We can try to guess a word that has letters that appear in many possibilities.

For example, among the candidates:
- GROVE: G and V
- DROVE: D and V
- BROKE: B and K
- FROZE: F and Z
- BROME: B and M

We see that V appears in GROVE and DROVE, B appears in BROKE and BROME, etc.

But we don't have a word that can test multiple at once because the pattern is fixed.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily in the candidate set but tests common letters for the first and fourth positions.

For example, we can guess a word that has S or L or I in the first or fourth position? But we have to fit the pattern _ R O _ E.

But we cannot change the known positions.

We must have R in second, O in third, E in fifth.

So the only flexibility is the first and fourth.

We can try to use a word that has a common letter in the first position and another in the fourth.

Common letters for first position: we haven't tried S, B, D, G, etc.

Common letters for fourth position: similarly.

But we need to form a valid word.

Let me list all possible words that fit _ R O _ E and don't use excluded letters (C, A, N, T, P).

Possible first letters: any letter except C, A, N, T, P and also not used? But we can use any except excluded.

Excluded: C, A, N, T, P.

So first letter can be: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But it must form a word with R O _ E.

Similarly, fourth letter: same set.

Now, let's think of words:

- B: BROME, BROKE (if valid)
- D: DROVE
- F: FROZE, FROME? (not common)
- G: GROVE, GROPE (P excluded), GROLE? no
- H: HROSE? no
- I: IROKE? no
- K: KROME? not common
- L: LROSE? no, but ""LROE"" no. ""LROME""? no. Actually, is there a word like ""LRO_E""? I can't think of one.
- M: MROME? no
- Q: QROME? no
- S: SROBE? no, ""SROKE""? no. ""SHROVE""? but H is in second? No, pattern is _ R O _ E, so ""SHROVE"" is S H R O V E? That's 6 letters. No, 5 letters: S, H, R, O, E? But then it would be S H R O E, which doesn't have O in third? Third is R? No: positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:R, 4:O, 5:E? But we need second to be R and third to be O. So ""SHROE"" is not a word and doesn't fit pattern.

We need the third letter to be O, so the word must be [letter1] R O [letter4] E.

So for S: is there a word ""SRO_E""? Like ""SROME""? Not a word. ""STROKE"" has T and is 6 letters? 5: S T R O K E? 6 letters. 5-letter: ""SROPE"" but P excluded and O is third? S R O P E? But P excluded.

Similarly, ""SROLE""? Not a word.

U: ""UROPE""? Not a word. Europe is 6.

V: ""VROME""? no.

W: ""WROSE""? no, ""WROKE"" has K and E? W R O K E? But that fits the pattern: W first, R second, O third, K fourth, E fifth. And ""wroke"" is not common, but ""wreak"" is different. ""WROKE"" might be archaic for ""wreaked"", but it's not commonly used. In Wordle, it might not be accepted.

Similarly, ""WROTE"" has T excluded.

X, Y, Z: unlikely.

So the common ones are: GROVE, DROVE, BROKE, FROZE, BROME.

BROME: is it valid? Brome is a type of grass, so yes.

FROZE: not a word, but ""froze"" is the past of freeze, which is F R O Z E, so 5 letters: F, R, O, Z, E. That fits.

Similarly, BROKE: B, R, O, K, E.

DROVE: D, R, O, V, E.

GROVE: G, R, O, V, E.

Also, ""TRODE"" is not common and T excluded.

Another one: ""GROSS"" but not ending with E.

So, we have a few possibilities.

We need to guess one of them, but we can also use a guess that tests a letter that appears in multiple possibilities.

For example, V appears in GROVE and DROVE.

B appears in BROKE and BROME.

K appears in BROKE.

Z appears in FROZE.

M appears in BROME.

G appears only in GROVE.

D appears only in DROVE.

F appears only in FROZE.

So if we guess a word that has, say, B, then if B is in the word, it must be in first position, and then we can narrow down.

Similarly for V, if V is in the word, it must be in fourth position.

But we don't have a word that tests B and V together? Not in this pattern.

We have to guess one of the candidates.

We can also consider that we have not tried S, L, I, etc., but they don't form words in this pattern.

So, we must choose from the candidates.

To maximize information, we can choose a word that has a common letter. For example, B is more common than Z or V.

BROKE has B and K.

But K is less common.

DROVE has D and V.

GROVE has G and V.

FROZE has F and Z.

BROME has B and M.

Among the first letters, B, D, G, F are all possible.

We can try ""BROKE"" as a guess.

If it's correct, great. If not, we get feedback on B and K.

Similarly, if we guess ""DROVE"", we test D and V.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is the third guess.

We can afford to guess one of them.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not in the candidate set but tests letters that are in multiple candidates? But we cannot, because the pattern is fixed.

For example, if we guess ""GIVEN"", but that doesn't have R in second or O in third, so it would be inefficient.

We must stick to the pattern.

So, I think we should guess one of the candidates.

I'll choose ""BROKE"" because B is a common starting letter.

So, third guess: BROKE

But let's confirm: B is not excluded, R is correct, O is correct, K is new, E is correct.

If the word is ""BROKE"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and K.

For example, if B is not in the word, then we know the first letter is not B, so it must be D, G, F, etc.

Similarly for K.

But K is in the fourth position.

So, I think it's a reasonable guess.

Another option: ""DROVE"" is also common.

But I'll go with ""BROKE"".

So, <guess>broke</guess>

But let me see if there's a word that tests more common letters.

What about ""SHIRE""? But that doesn't fit the pattern: we need third letter O.

No.

I think ""BROKE"" is fine.

    - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).  
    - C, A, and N are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: trope** → Feedback: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).  
    - R and E are confirmed in their positions (2nd and 5th).  
    - T and P are not in the word.  

### Current Knowledge:
- The secret word has the pattern: **? R O ? E** (2nd letter: R, 3rd letter: O, 5th letter: E).  
- Excluded letters: **C, A, N, T, P** (cannot appear in the word).  
- Unknown positions: **1st and 4th letters**.  
- Remaining possibilities for the 1st and 4th letters must be from the unused alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, S, V, W, etc.), and must form a valid English word.  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning for the Next Guess:
1. **Focus on the unknown positions**: We need to test potential letters for the 1st and 4th positions. Common letters not yet tested include B, D, S, L, M, and V.  
2. **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: B, D, and S are very common in English, so testing them could quickly narrow down options.  
3. **Generate valid word candidates**:  
   - Possible words fitting **? R O ? E** and avoiding excluded letters (C, A, N, T, P) include:  
     - **BROKE** (B in 1st, K in 4th)  
     - **DROVE** (D in 1st, V in 4th)  
     - **GROVE** (G in 1st, V in 4th)  
     - **FROZE** (F in 1st, Z in 4th)  
     - **BROME** (B in 1st, M in 4th)  
   - Among these, **BROKE** and **DROVE** are common words and test high-frequency letters (B/D for 1st position, K/V for 4th position).  
4. **Maximize information gain**:  
   - Guessing **BROKE** tests B (common starting letter) and K. If B is correct, it confirms the 1st letter; if not, it eliminates B, pointing to alternatives like D or G. Similarly, K's feedback will help with the 4th position.  
   - **BROKE** is chosen over **DROVE** because B is slightly more common than D as a starting letter, and it covers a different set of possibilities (e.g., if B is invalid, D and G become top candidates).  
5. **Efficiency**: With only 6 guesses total, this guess could solve the puzzle if correct or provide critical constraints for the 4th guess.  

<guess>broke</guess>",broke,"We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

Guess 2: ""trope""
- T: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so O is the third letter)
- P: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

From this, we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R O _ E
- The second letter is R, third is O, fifth is E.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, P (from the x's)
- We also know that O is in the third position and is correct.

So the word is of the form: _ R O _ E

We need to find the first and fourth letters.

We have excluded: C, A, N, T, P.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, P.

Remaining common letters: We should try to use common consonants and vowels that haven't been tried. We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid 5-letter word.

The first letter: it must be a letter not excluded, so not C, A, N, T, P.

The fourth letter: similarly, not excluded.

We know the word has R, O, E, and two more letters.

We can think of words that fit _ R O _ E.

Possible words:
- PROBE: but P is excluded, so no.
- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E -> G and V are new.
- DROVE: D, R, O, V, E -> D and V new.
- PROSE: P excluded.
- ROUTE: but U is in fourth? And T is excluded? T is excluded, so no.
- BROKE: B, R, O, K, E -> B and K new.
- FROZE: F, R, O, Z, E -> F and Z new.
- GROPE: P excluded.
- TROVE: T excluded.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

So, let's list possible words:
- GROVE
- DROVE
- BROKE
- FROZE
- Also, ""WROTE"": but T is excluded, so no.
- ""BRIDE"": but I is in third? We need O in third. Pattern is _ R O _ E, so third must be O.

Another one: ""AROSE"" but A is excluded.

""CRONE"" but C excluded.

""DRONE"": D, R, O, N, E -> but N is excluded? From guess 1, N is not in the word, so no.

""PRONE"": P excluded.

""TRONE"": T excluded.

""SHONE"": S, H, O, N, E -> but N excluded.

""PHONE"": P and N excluded.

""SCONE"": S, C, O, N, E -> C and N excluded.

So, back to:
- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E
- DROVE: D, R, O, V, E
- BROKE: B, R, O, K, E
- FROZE: F, R, O, Z, E
- Also, ""TRODE"": but T excluded? TRODE has T, so no.
- ""BROME"": B, R, O, M, E -> is that a word? Brome is a type of grass, I think it's valid.
- ""GROPE"": P excluded.
- ""CRORE"": C excluded.

Another one: ""PROLE"": P excluded.

""WROTE"": T excluded.

""WROKE"": not common, and W is first? But we can check.

But let's focus on common words.

We also have ""IRONE"": but I is first? And N excluded? No.

""GRACE"": C and A excluded.

So, possible candidates: GROVE, DROVE, BROKE, FROZE, and BROME.

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have to guess one of these, but we don't know which one. We can use a guess that includes letters that are common to narrow down.

But we have only one position unknown? Actually, two positions: first and fourth.

We know the pattern: first letter and fourth letter are missing.

We can try to guess a word that has letters that appear in many possibilities.

For example, among the candidates:
- GROVE: G and V
- DROVE: D and V
- BROKE: B and K
- FROZE: F and Z
- BROME: B and M

We see that V appears in GROVE and DROVE, B appears in BROKE and BROME, etc.

But we don't have a word that can test multiple at once because the pattern is fixed.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily in the candidate set but tests common letters for the first and fourth positions.

For example, we can guess a word that has S or L or I in the first or fourth position? But we have to fit the pattern _ R O _ E.

But we cannot change the known positions.

We must have R in second, O in third, E in fifth.

So the only flexibility is the first and fourth.

We can try to use a word that has a common letter in the first position and another in the fourth.

Common letters for first position: we haven't tried S, B, D, G, etc.

Common letters for fourth position: similarly.

But we need to form a valid word.

Let me list all possible words that fit _ R O _ E and don't use excluded letters (C, A, N, T, P).

Possible first letters: any letter except C, A, N, T, P and also not used? But we can use any except excluded.

Excluded: C, A, N, T, P.

So first letter can be: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But it must form a word with R O _ E.

Similarly, fourth letter: same set.

Now, let's think of words:

- B: BROME, BROKE (if valid)
- D: DROVE
- F: FROZE, FROME? (not common)
- G: GROVE, GROPE (P excluded), GROLE? no
- H: HROSE? no
- I: IROKE? no
- K: KROME? not common
- L: LROSE? no, but ""LROE"" no. ""LROME""? no. Actually, is there a word like ""LRO_E""? I can't think of one.
- M: MROME? no
- Q: QROME? no
- S: SROBE? no, ""SROKE""? no. ""SHROVE""? but H is in second? No, pattern is _ R O _ E, so ""SHROVE"" is S H R O V E? That's 6 letters. No, 5 letters: S, H, R, O, E? But then it would be S H R O E, which doesn't have O in third? Third is R? No: positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:R, 4:O, 5:E? But we need second to be R and third to be O. So ""SHROE"" is not a word and doesn't fit pattern.

We need the third letter to be O, so the word must be [letter1] R O [letter4] E.

So for S: is there a word ""SRO_E""? Like ""SROME""? Not a word. ""STROKE"" has T and is 6 letters? 5: S T R O K E? 6 letters. 5-letter: ""SROPE"" but P excluded and O is third? S R O P E? But P excluded.

Similarly, ""SROLE""? Not a word.

U: ""UROPE""? Not a word. Europe is 6.

V: ""VROME""? no.

W: ""WROSE""? no, ""WROKE"" has K and E? W R O K E? But that fits the pattern: W first, R second, O third, K fourth, E fifth. And ""wroke"" is not common, but ""wreak"" is different. ""WROKE"" might be archaic for ""wreaked"", but it's not commonly used. In Wordle, it might not be accepted.

Similarly, ""WROTE"" has T excluded.

X, Y, Z: unlikely.

So the common ones are: GROVE, DROVE, BROKE, FROZE, BROME.

BROME: is it valid? Brome is a type of grass, so yes.

FROZE: not a word, but ""froze"" is the past of freeze, which is F R O Z E, so 5 letters: F, R, O, Z, E. That fits.

Similarly, BROKE: B, R, O, K, E.

DROVE: D, R, O, V, E.

GROVE: G, R, O, V, E.

Also, ""TRODE"" is not common and T excluded.

Another one: ""GROSS"" but not ending with E.

So, we have a few possibilities.

We need to guess one of them, but we can also use a guess that tests a letter that appears in multiple possibilities.

For example, V appears in GROVE and DROVE.

B appears in BROKE and BROME.

K appears in BROKE.

Z appears in FROZE.

M appears in BROME.

G appears only in GROVE.

D appears only in DROVE.

F appears only in FROZE.

So if we guess a word that has, say, B, then if B is in the word, it must be in first position, and then we can narrow down.

Similarly for V, if V is in the word, it must be in fourth position.

But we don't have a word that tests B and V together? Not in this pattern.

We have to guess one of the candidates.

We can also consider that we have not tried S, L, I, etc., but they don't form words in this pattern.

So, we must choose from the candidates.

To maximize information, we can choose a word that has a common letter. For example, B is more common than Z or V.

BROKE has B and K.

But K is less common.

DROVE has D and V.

GROVE has G and V.

FROZE has F and Z.

BROME has B and M.

Among the first letters, B, D, G, F are all possible.

We can try ""BROKE"" as a guess.

If it's correct, great. If not, we get feedback on B and K.

Similarly, if we guess ""DROVE"", we test D and V.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is the third guess.

We can afford to guess one of them.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not in the candidate set but tests letters that are in multiple candidates? But we cannot, because the pattern is fixed.

For example, if we guess ""GIVEN"", but that doesn't have R in second or O in third, so it would be inefficient.

We must stick to the pattern.

So, I think we should guess one of the candidates.

I'll choose ""BROKE"" because B is a common starting letter.

So, third guess: BROKE

But let's confirm: B is not excluded, R is correct, O is correct, K is new, E is correct.

If the word is ""BROKE"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and K.

For example, if B is not in the word, then we know the first letter is not B, so it must be D, G, F, etc.

Similarly for K.

But K is in the fourth position.

So, I think it's a reasonable guess.

Another option: ""DROVE"" is also common.

But I'll go with ""BROKE"".

So, <guess>broke</guess>

But let me see if there's a word that tests more common letters.

What about ""SHIRE""? But that doesn't fit the pattern: we need third letter O.

No.

I think ""BROKE"" is fine.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

So we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

Therefore, the word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We also know that the word does not contain C, A, or N.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to use other common letters to uncover more information.

We know the word has R in the second position and E at the end. We need to find the first, third, and fourth letters.

We should avoid using C, A, N.

Common vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U (but we already tried A and E, and E is in). We also have E at the end, so the word might have another vowel? We don't know.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that has:
- First position: a new vowel or consonant (but not C, A, N)
- Third position: a vowel? (since we have R and then a letter, then two more and then E)
- Fourth position: a consonant?

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ E and that don't contain C, A, N.

But note: we are not required to guess a word that fits the pattern exactly because we are still in the process of gathering information. We can guess a word that doesn't fit the pattern to test other letters.

However, if we can guess a word that fits the pattern and tests new letters, that would be ideal.

But we don't know the first, third, and fourth letters. So we can try a word that has R in the second position and E at the end, and uses new letters for the other positions.

Possible words: 
- PRIDE: P, R, I, D, E -> but we don't know if P, I, D are in the word.
- BRINE: but B is new, but we have N which is excluded (from previous feedback, N is not in the word) so we cannot use BRINE because it has N.
- TRIPE: T, R, I, P, E -> T, I, P are new and we avoid C, A, N.

But let's check: TRIPE: T (first), R (second, correct), I (third), P (fourth), E (fifth, correct). This uses T, I, P which are new and not excluded.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have E at the end to test other positions? But we know E is at the end, so if we put E in a different position, we might get a '-' if it's present elsewhere? But the feedback for E in the first guess was in the fifth position and correct, so E is only in the fifth position? Not necessarily, it could be elsewhere too? The feedback only tells us about the positions we guessed.

In the first guess, we had E at the fifth position and it was correct. But the word might have another E? However, we don't know. But the feedback for E was a check, meaning it is in the word and in that position. It doesn't say anything about other E's.

But in the feedback, we only get information about the letters we guessed. So if the word has two E's, we wouldn't know until we guess an E in another position.

But for now, we know at least one E is at the end.

So, for the second guess, we can try to use a word that has E in the fifth position and R in the second, and new letters elsewhere.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ _ E and don't have C, A, N:

- GRIME: G, R, I, M, E
- PRICE: but C is excluded, so no.
- BRIDE: B, R, I, D, E
- TRITE: T, R, I, T, E -> but T is repeated, might be less informative.
- DRIVE: D, R, I, V, E
- WRITE: W, R, I, T, E

We want to test as many new letters as possible. We have not tried: B, D, G, I, M, P, T, V, W, etc.

I think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate: it uses W, R, I, T, E. We know R and E are in the word and in the correct positions. We are testing W, I, T.

Similarly, ""DRIVE"" tests D, I, V.

But note: we are not limited to words that have R and E in the correct positions? We can guess a word without R in the second or E in the fifth? But that might not be efficient because we know R must be in the second and E in the fifth. If we put R elsewhere, we might get a '-' if it's present, but we already know it's in the second. Similarly for E.

But if we put R in a different position, we might get a '-' for R in that position? But we know the word has R in the second, so if we put R in the first, it would be wrong and we might get a '-' if there is another R? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters.

However, to maximize information, it might be better to avoid putting known letters in positions we know they are not? But we don't know about duplicates.

Alternatively, we can stick to the pattern and test new letters.

I think ""WRITE"" is a good guess because:
- It has W (new), R (correct), I (new), T (new), E (correct).
- We can see if W, I, T are in the word and in which positions.

Similarly, ""PRIDE"" (P, R, I, D, E) is also good.

But let's choose one. I'll go with ""WRITE"".

So, second guess: WRITE

But note: we are not forced to use the pattern. We could also try a word that doesn't have R in the second or E in the fifth to test for other letters? But that might be less efficient because we are not using the known information.

For example, if we guess a word without R in the second, then we might get a '-' for R in a different position, which would tell us if there is another R? But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

But since we have limited guesses, it's better to focus on the known pattern and test new letters.

I think ""WRITE"" is a reasonable choice.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has a different set of letters to cover more common ones. For example, we haven't tried S, L, O, etc.

But in ""WRITE"", we are testing W, I, T. W is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.

How about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E -> tests P, I, D.

Or ""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> tests B, I, D.

But we don't know if B, I, D are in the word.

Another common word: ""TRICE"" but C is excluded.

""ROUSE"": but R is in the first position? We need R in the second? Actually, in ""ROUSE"", R is first, but we know R is second in the target. So if we guess ""ROUSE"", we would have:
- R in first: if the word has R only in the second, then R in first would be marked as not in the word? No, the feedback would be: R is in the word but in the wrong position (because the target has R in second, so R is present) so we would get a '-' for R? But we already know R is in the word. So it doesn't give new information about R. Similarly, we know E is in the fifth, but if we put E in the fourth? Then we might get a '-' for E if it is also elsewhere? But we don't know.

So to avoid confusion, it's better to keep R in the second and E in the fifth and test the other positions.

Therefore, I'll go with ""PRIDE"".

But let me see: we have to avoid C, A, N. ""PRIDE"" has P, R, I, D, E. All new.

Similarly, ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.

I think ""PRIDE"" is a good choice.

But let me think of the most common letters. After vowels, common consonants are T, S, L, R (we have R), D, etc.

So including T and D might be good.

""TRIDE"" is not a word. ""BRIDE"" is a word: B, R, I, D, E.

Or ""GRIDE"" is not common. ""PRIDE"" is common.

But ""PRIDE"" doesn't have T. How about ""TRIPE""? T, R, I, P, E.

""TRIPE"" is a word (meaning a part of the stomach of an animal, or to rip off? but it's valid).

But ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.

Alternatively, ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E.

I think I'll go with ""PRIDE"" because it's a common word.

But let me check: we are testing P, I, D. We already know R and E are in place.

So, second guess: PRIDE

But note: we are not sure if the word has I or D or P. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has S, because S is very common. But we cannot put S in the second or fifth? We can put S in the first, third, or fourth.

For example, ""RICES"" but C is excluded and S at the end? But we have E at the end, so we cannot have S at the end. The pattern is _ R _ _ E, so the fourth letter is before E. So we can have S in the first, third, or fourth.

But we don't have a word that fits and has S? For example, ""RUSHE"" is not a word. ""ARISE"" but A is excluded. ""ERASE"" but E is at the beginning? And A is excluded? ""ERASE"" has A, which is excluded.

""RISE"" is only 4 letters. ""PRISE"" is a word: P, R, I, S, E -> but that fits: _ R _ _ E -> PRISE: P (first), R (second), I (third), S (fourth), E (fifth). And it has S.

But we don't know if S is in the word. And we avoid A, C, N? PRISE: P, R, I, S, E. No A, C, N.

So ""PRISE"" is a valid guess and it tests P, I, S.

S is more common than D? So maybe ""PRISE"" is better than ""PRIDE"".

Similarly, ""BRISE"" is not a word.

So I think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: PRISE is a word? It means to force open or a lever, but it's accepted in word games.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" but A is excluded.

So, I'll go with ""PRISE"".

But we have to decide.

Another common word: ""TRICE"" is invalid because of C.

""ROUTE"" but O is new, but R is in first? We need R in second.

I think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.

But let me see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can use ""TRITE"" but it has T repeated? Not ideal.

I think ""PRISE"" is a solid choice.

So, second guess: PRISE

But note: we are not required to use the pattern? But it's efficient.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have R in the second to test for other letters? But that might waste the known information.

I think sticking to the pattern is better.

So, I'll go with ""PRISE"".

But let me think of the word list. Is ""PRISE"" common? It might be less common than ""PRIDE"", but it's valid.

Another option: ""BRINE"" but N is excluded, so no.

""CRIME"" but C is excluded.

""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> tests D, I, V.

V is less common.

""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> tests W, I, T.

W is less common.

So among the options, ""PRISE"" (with S) or ""PRIDE"" (with D) or ""TRIPE"" (with T and P).

I think S is more common than D or T? Actually, T is more common than S? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have E and R, and we've excluded A, N, C. So we haven't tried I, O, T, S, L.

So we should try to cover I, O, T, S, L.

In one guess, we can test multiple.

In ""PRISE"", we test P, I, S. We are missing O, T, L.

In ""TRIPE"", we test T, I, P. Missing O, S, L.

In ""TOILE"" but O and I, but T in first? And we need R in second? Not matching.

We can't cover all in one guess.

But we can try to cover as many as possible.

Another word: ""ROLES"" but R is first? We need R second. If we guess ""ROLES"", we get:
- R: if the word has R only in second, then R in first would be marked as '-' (wrong position) and we already know R is in the word, so it doesn't help. Similarly, E is at the end? But we have E in fifth? In ""ROLES"", E is fourth? So we might get information about E? But we know E is in fifth, so if we put E in fourth, we might get a '-' if there is another E? But we don't know.

But to test more common letters, we could guess a word that has O, T, S, L, and avoid known bad letters.

For example, ""SLATE"" but A is excluded and we have E at the end? But in ""SLATE"", E is fifth, which is correct. But A is excluded, so we cannot use ""SLATE"".

""SLOPE"": S, L, O, P, E -> E at the end is correct. But we don't have R in the second? So we are not using the known R position.

But we can test S, L, O, P. And we know E is at the end.

But we are not testing the first, third, and fourth positions of the pattern? We are testing a completely different word.

This might be acceptable because we can get information about S, L, O, P.

But we know the word has R in the second position, so if we don't include R in the guess, we won't get information about other positions of R? But we already know R is in the word and in the second position, so if we don't include R, we don't learn anything new about R. But we are testing other letters.

However, we have only 6 guesses, so we need to balance.

I think for the second guess, it's better to use the known information and test the unknown positions.

Therefore, I'll stick with a word that has R in the second and E in the fifth.

Let me choose ""PRISE"".

So, second guess: PRISE

But to be more confident, let me see if there's a word that includes T and O? But I can't think of one that fits _ R _ _ E without excluded letters.

""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E -> that fits! And O is a common vowel we haven't tried.

""TROPE"" is a word (meaning a recurring theme). And it has T, R, O, P, E. We test T, O, P.

O is a vowel we haven't tried, which is good.

So ""TROPE"" might be better than ""PRISE"" because we test O instead of S, and O is a vowel.

Similarly, we test T and P.

So I think ""TROPE"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TROPE"".

Second guess: TROPE

In summary, we are guessing ""TROPE"" to test T, O, P in the context of the pattern _ R _ _ E.

So, the guess is ""trope"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter) (✓).

This reveals:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E.
- The letters C, A, and N are excluded.
- The second letter is R, and the fifth letter is E.

For the second guess, I need to test new letters to uncover the first, third, and fourth positions. I should prioritize common vowels and consonants not yet tried (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, D) while avoiding C, A, and N. The word ""trope"" fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and includes:
- T (new, tests first position),
- R (known, second position),
- O (new vowel, tests third position),
- P (new, tests fourth position),
- E (known, fifth position).

This guess efficiently tests three new letters (T, O, P) and maintains the known R and E positions, maximizing information gain.

<guess>trope</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: trope -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

Guess 2: ""trope""
- T: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so O is the third letter)
- P: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

From this, we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R O _ E
- The second letter is R, third is O, fifth is E.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, P (from the x's)
- We also know that O is in the third position and is correct.

So the word is of the form: _ R O _ E

We need to find the first and fourth letters.

We have excluded: C, A, N, T, P.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, P.

Remaining common letters: We should try to use common consonants and vowels that haven't been tried. We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid 5-letter word.

The first letter: it must be a letter not excluded, so not C, A, N, T, P.

The fourth letter: similarly, not excluded.

We know the word has R, O, E, and two more letters.

We can think of words that fit _ R O _ E.

Possible words:
- PROBE: but P is excluded, so no.
- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E -> G and V are new.
- DROVE: D, R, O, V, E -> D and V new.
- PROSE: P excluded.
- ROUTE: but U is in fourth? And T is excluded? T is excluded, so no.
- BROKE: B, R, O, K, E -> B and K new.
- FROZE: F, R, O, Z, E -> F and Z new.
- GROPE: P excluded.
- TROVE: T excluded.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

So, let's list possible words:
- GROVE
- DROVE
- BROKE
- FROZE
- Also, ""WROTE"": but T is excluded, so no.
- ""BRIDE"": but I is in third? We need O in third. Pattern is _ R O _ E, so third must be O.

Another one: ""AROSE"" but A is excluded.

""CRONE"" but C excluded.

""DRONE"": D, R, O, N, E -> but N is excluded? From guess 1, N is not in the word, so no.

""PRONE"": P excluded.

""TRONE"": T excluded.

""SHONE"": S, H, O, N, E -> but N excluded.

""PHONE"": P and N excluded.

""SCONE"": S, C, O, N, E -> C and N excluded.

So, back to:
- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E
- DROVE: D, R, O, V, E
- BROKE: B, R, O, K, E
- FROZE: F, R, O, Z, E
- Also, ""TRODE"": but T excluded? TRODE has T, so no.
- ""BROME"": B, R, O, M, E -> is that a word? Brome is a type of grass, I think it's valid.
- ""GROPE"": P excluded.
- ""CRORE"": C excluded.

Another one: ""PROLE"": P excluded.

""WROTE"": T excluded.

""WROKE"": not common, and W is first? But we can check.

But let's focus on common words.

We also have ""IRONE"": but I is first? And N excluded? No.

""GRACE"": C and A excluded.

So, possible candidates: GROVE, DROVE, BROKE, FROZE, and BROME.

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have to guess one of these, but we don't know which one. We can use a guess that includes letters that are common to narrow down.

But we have only one position unknown? Actually, two positions: first and fourth.

We know the pattern: first letter and fourth letter are missing.

We can try to guess a word that has letters that appear in many possibilities.

For example, among the candidates:
- GROVE: G and V
- DROVE: D and V
- BROKE: B and K
- FROZE: F and Z
- BROME: B and M

We see that V appears in GROVE and DROVE, B appears in BROKE and BROME, etc.

But we don't have a word that can test multiple at once because the pattern is fixed.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily in the candidate set but tests common letters for the first and fourth positions.

For example, we can guess a word that has S or L or I in the first or fourth position? But we have to fit the pattern _ R O _ E.

But we cannot change the known positions.

We must have R in second, O in third, E in fifth.

So the only flexibility is the first and fourth.

We can try to use a word that has a common letter in the first position and another in the fourth.

Common letters for first position: we haven't tried S, B, D, G, etc.

Common letters for fourth position: similarly.

But we need to form a valid word.

Let me list all possible words that fit _ R O _ E and don't use excluded letters (C, A, N, T, P).

Possible first letters: any letter except C, A, N, T, P and also not used? But we can use any except excluded.

Excluded: C, A, N, T, P.

So first letter can be: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But it must form a word with R O _ E.

Similarly, fourth letter: same set.

Now, let's think of words:

- B: BROME, BROKE (if valid)
- D: DROVE
- F: FROZE, FROME? (not common)
- G: GROVE, GROPE (P excluded), GROLE? no
- H: HROSE? no
- I: IROKE? no
- K: KROME? not common
- L: LROSE? no, but ""LROE"" no. ""LROME""? no. Actually, is there a word like ""LRO_E""? I can't think of one.
- M: MROME? no
- Q: QROME? no
- S: SROBE? no, ""SROKE""? no. ""SHROVE""? but H is in second? No, pattern is _ R O _ E, so ""SHROVE"" is S H R O V E? That's 6 letters. No, 5 letters: S, H, R, O, E? But then it would be S H R O E, which doesn't have O in third? Third is R? No: positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:R, 4:O, 5:E? But we need second to be R and third to be O. So ""SHROE"" is not a word and doesn't fit pattern.

We need the third letter to be O, so the word must be [letter1] R O [letter4] E.

So for S: is there a word ""SRO_E""? Like ""SROME""? Not a word. ""STROKE"" has T and is 6 letters? 5: S T R O K E? 6 letters. 5-letter: ""SROPE"" but P excluded and O is third? S R O P E? But P excluded.

Similarly, ""SROLE""? Not a word.

U: ""UROPE""? Not a word. Europe is 6.

V: ""VROME""? no.

W: ""WROSE""? no, ""WROKE"" has K and E? W R O K E? But that fits the pattern: W first, R second, O third, K fourth, E fifth. And ""wroke"" is not common, but ""wreak"" is different. ""WROKE"" might be archaic for ""wreaked"", but it's not commonly used. In Wordle, it might not be accepted.

Similarly, ""WROTE"" has T excluded.

X, Y, Z: unlikely.

So the common ones are: GROVE, DROVE, BROKE, FROZE, BROME.

BROME: is it valid? Brome is a type of grass, so yes.

FROZE: not a word, but ""froze"" is the past of freeze, which is F R O Z E, so 5 letters: F, R, O, Z, E. That fits.

Similarly, BROKE: B, R, O, K, E.

DROVE: D, R, O, V, E.

GROVE: G, R, O, V, E.

Also, ""TRODE"" is not common and T excluded.

Another one: ""GROSS"" but not ending with E.

So, we have a few possibilities.

We need to guess one of them, but we can also use a guess that tests a letter that appears in multiple possibilities.

For example, V appears in GROVE and DROVE.

B appears in BROKE and BROME.

K appears in BROKE.

Z appears in FROZE.

M appears in BROME.

G appears only in GROVE.

D appears only in DROVE.

F appears only in FROZE.

So if we guess a word that has, say, B, then if B is in the word, it must be in first position, and then we can narrow down.

Similarly for V, if V is in the word, it must be in fourth position.

But we don't have a word that tests B and V together? Not in this pattern.

We have to guess one of the candidates.

We can also consider that we have not tried S, L, I, etc., but they don't form words in this pattern.

So, we must choose from the candidates.

To maximize information, we can choose a word that has a common letter. For example, B is more common than Z or V.

BROKE has B and K.

But K is less common.

DROVE has D and V.

GROVE has G and V.

FROZE has F and Z.

BROME has B and M.

Among the first letters, B, D, G, F are all possible.

We can try ""BROKE"" as a guess.

If it's correct, great. If not, we get feedback on B and K.

Similarly, if we guess ""DROVE"", we test D and V.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is the third guess.

We can afford to guess one of them.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not in the candidate set but tests letters that are in multiple candidates? But we cannot, because the pattern is fixed.

For example, if we guess ""GIVEN"", but that doesn't have R in second or O in third, so it would be inefficient.

We must stick to the pattern.

So, I think we should guess one of the candidates.

I'll choose ""BROKE"" because B is a common starting letter.

So, third guess: BROKE

But let's confirm: B is not excluded, R is correct, O is correct, K is new, E is correct.

If the word is ""BROKE"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and K.

For example, if B is not in the word, then we know the first letter is not B, so it must be D, G, F, etc.

Similarly for K.

But K is in the fourth position.

So, I think it's a reasonable guess.

Another option: ""DROVE"" is also common.

But I'll go with ""BROKE"".

So, <guess>broke</guess>

But let me see if there's a word that tests more common letters.

What about ""SHIRE""? But that doesn't fit the pattern: we need third letter O.

No.

I think ""BROKE"" is fine.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).  
    - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).  
    - C, A, and N are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: trope** → Feedback: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).  
    - R and E are confirmed in their positions (2nd and 5th).  
    - T and P are not in the word.  

### Current Knowledge:
- The secret word has the pattern: **? R O ? E** (2nd letter: R, 3rd letter: O, 5th letter: E).  
- Excluded letters: **C, A, N, T, P** (cannot appear in the word).  
- Unknown positions: **1st and 4th letters**.  
- Remaining possibilities for the 1st and 4th letters must be from the unused alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, S, V, W, etc.), and must form a valid English word.  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning for the Next Guess:
1. **Focus on the unknown positions**: We need to test potential letters for the 1st and 4th positions. Common letters not yet tested include B, D, S, L, M, and V.  
2. **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: B, D, and S are very common in English, so testing them could quickly narrow down options.  
3. **Generate valid word candidates**:  
   - Possible words fitting **? R O ? E** and avoiding excluded letters (C, A, N, T, P) include:  
     - **BROKE** (B in 1st, K in 4th)  
     - **DROVE** (D in 1st, V in 4th)  
     - **GROVE** (G in 1st, V in 4th)  
     - **FROZE** (F in 1st, Z in 4th)  
     - **BROME** (B in 1st, M in 4th)  
   - Among these, **BROKE** and **DROVE** are common words and test high-frequency letters (B/D for 1st position, K/V for 4th position).  
4. **Maximize information gain**:  
   - Guessing **BROKE** tests B (common starting letter) and K. If B is correct, it confirms the 1st letter; if not, it eliminates B, pointing to alternatives like D or G. Similarly, K's feedback will help with the 4th position.  
   - **BROKE** is chosen over **DROVE** because B is slightly more common than D as a starting letter, and it covers a different set of possibilities (e.g., if B is invalid, D and G become top candidates).  
5. **Efficiency**: With only 6 guesses total, this guess could solve the puzzle if correct or provide critical constraints for the 4th guess.

This uses T, I, P which are new and not excluded.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t have E at the end to test other positions? But we know E is at the end, so if we put E in a different position, we might get a \'-\' if it\'s present elsewhere? But the feedback for E in the first guess was in the fifth position and correct, so E is only in the fifth position? Not necessarily, it could be elsewhere too? The feedback only tells us about the positions we guessed.\n\nIn the first guess, we had E at the fifth position and it was correct. But the word might have another E? However, we don\'t know. But the feedback for E was a check, meaning it is in the word and in that position.

So if the word has two E\'s, we wouldn\'t know until we guess an E in another position.\n\nBut for now, we know at least one E is at the end.\n\nSo, for the second guess, we can try to use a word that has E in the fifth position and R in the second, and new letters elsewhere.\n\nLet me list some words that fit _ R _ _ E and don\'t have C, A, N:\n\n- GRIME: G, R, I, M, E\n- PRICE: but C is excluded, so no.\n- BRIDE: B, R, I, D, E\n- TRITE: T, R, I, T, E -> but T is repeated, might be less informative.\n- DRIVE: D, R, I, V, E\n- WRITE: W, R, I, T, E\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible. We have not tried: B, D, G, I, M, P, T, V, W, etc.\n\nI think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate: it uses W, R, I, T, E. We know R and E are in the word and in the correct positions. We are testing W, I, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""DRIVE"" tests D, I, V.\n\nBut note: we are not limited to words that have R and E in the correct positions? We can guess a word without R in the second or E in the fifth? But that might not be efficient because we know R must be in the second and E in the fifth. If we put R elsewhere, we might get a \'-\' if it\'s present, but we already know it\'s in the second. Similarly for E.\n\nBut if we put R in a different position, we might get a \'-\' for R in that position? But we know the word has R in the second, so if we put R in the first, it would be wrong and we might get a \'-\' if there is another R? But we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters.\n\nHowever, to maximize information, it might be better to avoid putting known letters in positions we know they are not? But we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, we can stick to the pattern and test new letters.\n\nI think ""WRITE"" is a good guess because:\n- It has W (new), R (correct), I (new), T (new), E (correct).\n- We can see if W, I, T are in the word and in which positions.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRIDE"" (P, R, I, D, E) is also good.\n\nBut let\'s choose one. I\'ll go with ""WRITE"".\n\nSo, second guess: WRITE\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use the pattern. We could also try a word that doesn\'t have R in the second or E in the fifth to test for other letters? But that might be less efficient because we are not using the known information.\n\nFor example, if we guess a word without R in the second, then we might get a \'-\' for R in a different position, which would tell us if there is another R? But we don\'t know if there is a duplicate.\n\nBut since we have limited guesses, it\'s better to focus on the known pattern and test new letters.\n\nI think ""WRITE"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that has a different set of letters to cover more common ones. For example, we haven\'t tried S, L, O, etc.\n\nBut in ""WRITE"", we are testing W, I, T. W is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.\n\nHow about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E -> tests P, I, D.\n\nOr ""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> tests B, I, D.\n\nBut we don\'t know if B, I, D are in the word.\n\nAnother common word: ""TRICE"" but C is excluded.\n\n""ROUSE"": but R is in the first position? We need R in the second? Actually, in ""ROUSE"", R is first, but we know R is second in the target. So if we guess ""ROUSE"", we would have:\n- R in first: if the word has R only in the second, then R in first would be marked as not in the word? No, the feedback would be: R is in the word but in the wrong position (because the target has R in second, so R is present) so we would get a \'-\' for R? But we already know R is in the word. So it doesn\'t give new information about R. Similarly, we know E is in the fifth, but if we put E in the fourth? Then we might get a \'-\' for E if it is also elsewhere? But we don\'t know.\n\nSo to avoid confusion, it\'s better to keep R in the second and E in the fifth and test the other positions.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""PRIDE"".\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid C, A, N. ""PRIDE"" has P, R, I, D, E. All new.\n\nSimilarly, ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.\n\nI think ""PRIDE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me think of the most common letters. After vowels, common consonants are T, S, L, R (we have R), D, etc.\n\nSo including T and D might be good.\n\n""TRIDE"" is not a word. ""BRIDE"" is a word: B, R, I, D, E.\n\nOr ""GRIDE"" is not common. ""PRIDE"" is common.\n\nBut ""PRIDE"" doesn\'t have T. How about ""TRIPE""? T, R, I, P, E.\n\n""TRIPE"" is a word (meaning a part of the stomach of an animal, or to rip off? but it\'s valid).\n\nBut ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.\n\nAlternatively, ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""PRIDE"" because it\'s a common word.\n\nBut let me check: we are testing P, I, D. We already know R and E are in place.\n\nSo, second guess: PRIDE\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has I or D or P. We are testing them.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that has S, because S is very common. But we cannot put S in the second or fifth? We can put S in the first, third, or fourth.\n\nFor example, ""RICES"" but C is excluded and S at the end? But we have E at the end, so we cannot have S at the end. The pattern is _ R _ _ E, so the fourth letter is before E. So we can have S in the first, third, or fourth.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that fits and has S? For example, ""RUSHE"" is not a word. ""ARISE"" but A is excluded. ""ERASE"" but E is at the beginning? And A is excluded? ""ERASE"" has A, which is excluded.\n\n""RISE"" is only 4 letters. ""PRISE"" is a word: P, R, I, S, E -> but that fits: _ R _ _ E -> PRISE: P (first), R (second), I (third), S (fourth), E (fifth). And it has S.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S is in the word. And we avoid A, C, N? PRISE: P, R, I, S, E. No A, C, N.\n\nSo ""PRISE"" is a valid guess and it tests P, I, S.\n\nS is more common than D? So maybe ""PRISE"" is better than ""PRIDE"".\n\nSimilarly, ""BRISE"" is not a word.\n\nSo I think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: PRISE is a word? It means to force open or a lever, but it\'s accepted in word games.\n\nAlternatively, ""RAISE"" but A is excluded.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PRISE"".\n\nBut we have to decide.\n\nAnother common word: ""TRICE"" is invalid because of C.\n\n""ROUTE"" but O is new, but R is in first? We need R in second.\n\nI think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""TRITE"" but it has T repeated? Not ideal.\n\nI think ""PRISE"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo, second guess: PRISE\n\nBut note: we are not required to use the pattern? But it\'s efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that doesn\'t have R in the second to test for other letters? But that might waste the known information.\n\nI think sticking to the pattern is better.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PRISE"".\n\nBut let me think of the word list. Is ""PRISE"" common? It might be less common than ""PRIDE"", but it\'s valid.\n\nAnother option: ""BRINE"" but N is excluded, so no.\n\n""CRIME"" but C is excluded.\n\n""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> tests D, I, V.\n\nV is less common.\n\n""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> tests W, I, T.\n\nW is less common.\n\nSo among the options, ""PRISE"" (with S) or ""PRIDE"" (with D) or ""TRIPE"" (with T and P).\n\nI think S is more common than D or T? Actually, T is more common than S? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have E and R, and we\'ve excluded A, N, C. So we haven\'t tried I, O, T, S, L.\n\nSo we should try to cover I, O, T, S, L.\n\nIn one guess, we can test multiple.\n\nIn ""PRISE"", we test P, I, S. We are missing O, T, L.\n\nIn ""TRIPE"", we test T, I, P. Missing O, S, L.\n\nIn ""TOILE"" but O and I, but T in first? And we need R in second? Not matching.\n\nWe can\'t cover all in one guess.\n\nBut we can try to cover as many as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""ROLES"" but R is first? We need R second. If we guess ""ROLES"", we get:\n- R: if the word has R only in second, then R in first would be marked as \'-\' (wrong position) and we already know R is in the word, so it doesn\'t help. Similarly, E is at the end? But we have E in fifth? In ""ROLES"", E is fourth? So we might get information about E? But we know E is in fifth, so if we put E in fourth, we might get a \'-\' if there is another E? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to test more common letters, we could guess a word that has O, T, S, L, and avoid known bad letters.\n\nFor example, ""SLATE"" but A is excluded and we have E at the end? But in ""SLATE"", E is fifth, which is correct. But A is excluded, so we cannot use ""SLATE"".\n\n""SLOPE"": S, L, O, P, E -> E at the end is correct. But we don\'t have R in the second? So we are not using the known R position.\n\nBut we can test S, L, O, P. And we know E is at the end.\n\nBut we are not testing the first, third, and fourth positions of the pattern? We are testing a completely different word.\n\nThis might be acceptable because we can get information about S, L, O, P.\n\nBut we know the word has R in the second position, so if we don\'t include R in the guess, we won\'t get information about other positions of R? But we already know R is in the word and in the second position, so if we don\'t include R, we don\'t learn anything new about R. But we are testing other letters.\n\nHowever, we have only 6 guesses, so we need to balance.\n\nI think for the second guess, it\'s better to use the known information and test the unknown positions.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll stick with a word that has R in the second and E in the fifth.\n\nLet me choose ""PRISE"".\n\nSo, second guess: PRISE\n\nBut to be more confident, let me see if there\'s a word that includes T and O? But I can\'t think of one that fits _ R _ _ E without excluded letters.\n\n""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E -> that fits! And O is a common vowel we haven\'t tried.\n\n""TROPE"" is a word (meaning a recurring theme). And it has T, R, O, P, E. We test T, O, P.\n\nO is a vowel we haven\'t tried, which is good.\n\nSo ""TROPE"" might be better than ""PRISE"" because we test O instead of S, and O is a vowel.\n\nSimilarly, we test T and P.\n\nSo I think ""TROPE"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""TROPE"".\n\nSecond guess: TROPE\n\nIn summary, we are guessing ""TROPE"" to test T, O, P in the context of the pattern _ R _ _ E.\n\nSo, the guess is ""trope"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is not in the word (x).\n- R is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).\n- A is not in the word (x).\n- N is not in the word (x).\n- E is in the correct position (fifth letter) (✓).\n\nThis reveals:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E.\n- The letters C, A, and N are excluded.\n- The second letter is R, and the fifth letter is E.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to test new letters to uncover the first, third, and fourth positions. I should prioritize common vowels and consonants not yet tried (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, D) while avoiding C, A, and N. The word ""trope"" fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and includes:\n- T (new, tests first position),\n- R (known, second position),\n- O (new vowel, tests third position),\n- P (new, tests fourth position),\n- E (known, fifth position).\n\nThis guess efficiently tests three new letters (T, O, P) and maintains the known R and E positions, maximizing information gain.\n\n<guess>trope</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: trope -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)\n\nGuess 2: ""trope""\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)\n- O: ✓ (correct position, so O is the third letter)\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The word has the pattern: _ R O _ E\n- The second letter is R, third is O, fifth is E.\n- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, P (from the x\'s)\n- We also know that O is in the third position and is correct.\n\nSo the word is of the form: _ R O _ E\n\nWe need to find the first and fourth letters.\n\nWe have excluded: C, A, N, T, P.\n\nWe have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, P.\n\nRemaining common letters: We should try to use common consonants and vowels that haven\'t been tried.

But we can check.\n\nBut let\'s focus on common words.\n\nWe also have ""IRONE"": but I is first? And N excluded? No.\n\n""GRACE"": C and A excluded.\n\nSo, possible candidates: GROVE, DROVE, BROKE, FROZE, and BROME.\n\nWe need to choose one that tests new letters.\n\nWe have to guess one of these, but we don\'t know which one. We can use a guess that includes letters that are common to narrow down.\n\nBut we have only one position unknown? Actually, two positions: first and fourth.\n\nWe know the pattern: first letter and fourth letter are missing.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has letters that appear in many possibilities.\n\nFor example, among the candidates:\n- GROVE: G and V\n- DROVE: D and V\n- BROKE: B and K\n- FROZE: F and Z\n- BROME: B and M\n\nWe see that V appears in GROVE and DROVE, B appears in BROKE and BROME, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that can test multiple at once because the pattern is fixed.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily in the candidate set but tests common letters for the first and fourth positions.\n\nFor example, we can guess a word that has S or L or I in the first or fourth position? But we have to fit the pattern _ R O _ E.\n\nBut we cannot change the known positions.\n\nWe must have R in second, O in third, E in fifth.\n\nSo the only flexibility is the first and fourth.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has a common letter in the first position and another in the fourth.\n\nCommon letters for first position: we haven\'t tried S, B, D, G, etc.\n\nCommon letters for fourth position: similarly.\n\nBut we need to form a valid word.\n\nLet me list all possible words that fit _ R O _ E and don\'t use excluded letters (C, A, N, T, P).\n\nPossible first letters: any letter except C, A, N, T, P and also not used? But we can use any except excluded.\n\nExcluded: C, A, N, T, P.\n\nSo first letter can be: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut it must form a word with R O _ E.\n\nSimilarly, fourth letter: same set.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words:\n\n- B: BROME, BROKE (if valid)\n- D: DROVE\n- F: FROZE, FROME? (not common)\n- G: GROVE, GROPE (P excluded), GROLE? no\n- H: HROSE? no\n- I: IROKE? no\n- K: KROME? not common\n- L: LROSE? no, but ""LROE"" no. ""LROME""? no. Actually, is there a word like ""LRO_E""? I can\'t think of one.\n- M: MROME? no\n- Q: QROME? no\n- S: SROBE? no, ""SROKE""? no. ""SHROVE""? but H is in second? No, pattern is _ R O _ E, so ""SHROVE"" is S H R O V E? That\'s 6 letters. No, 5 letters: S, H, R, O, E? But then it would be S H R O E, which doesn\'t have O in third? Third is R? No: positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:R, 4:O, 5:E? But we need second to be R and third to be O. So ""SHROE"" is not a word and doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nWe need the third letter to be O, so the word must be [letter1] R O [letter4] E.\n\nSo for S: is there a word ""SRO_E""? Like ""SROME""? Not a word. ""STROKE"" has T and is 6 letters? 5: S T R O K E? 6 letters. 5-letter: ""SROPE"" but P excluded and O is third? S R O P E? But P excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""SROLE""? Not a word.\n\nU: ""UROPE""? Not a word. Europe is 6.\n\nV: ""VROME""? no.\n\nW: ""WROSE""? no, ""WROKE"" has K and E? W R O K E? But that fits the pattern: W first, R second, O third, K fourth, E fifth. And ""wroke"" is not common, but ""wreak"" is different. ""WROKE"" might be archaic for ""wreaked"", but it\'s not commonly used. In Wordle, it might not be accepted.\n\nSimilarly, ""WROTE"" has T excluded.\n\nX, Y, Z: unlikely.\n\nSo the common ones are: GROVE, DROVE, BROKE, FROZE, BROME.\n\nBROME: is it valid? Brome is a type of grass, so yes.\n\nFROZE: not a word, but ""froze"" is the past of freeze, which is F R O Z E, so 5 letters: F, R, O, Z, E. That fits.\n\nSimilarly, BROKE: B, R, O, K, E.\n\nDROVE: D, R, O, V, E.\n\nGROVE: G, R, O, V, E.\n\nAlso, ""TRODE"" is not common and T excluded.\n\nAnother one: ""GROSS"" but not ending with E.\n\nSo, we have a few possibilities.\n\nWe need to guess one of them, but we can also use a guess that tests a letter that appears in multiple possibilities.\n\nFor example, V appears in GROVE and DROVE.\n\nB appears in BROKE and BROME.\n\nK appears in BROKE.\n\nZ appears in FROZE.\n\nM appears in BROME.\n\nG appears only in GROVE.\n\nD appears only in DROVE.\n\nF appears only in FROZE.\n\nSo if we guess a word that has, say, B, then if B is in the word, it must be in first position, and then we can narrow down.\n\nSimilarly for V, if V is in the word, it must be in fourth position.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that tests B and V together? Not in this pattern.\n\nWe have to guess one of the candidates.\n\nWe can also consider that we have not tried S, L, I, etc., but they don\'t form words in this pattern.\n\nSo, we must choose from the candidates.\n\nTo maximize information, we can choose a word that has a common letter. For example, B is more common than Z or V.\n\nBROKE has B and K.\n\nBut K is less common.\n\nDROVE has D and V.\n\nGROVE has G and V.\n\nFROZE has F and Z.\n\nBROME has B and M.\n\nAmong the first letters, B, D, G, F are all possible.\n\nWe can try ""BROKE"" as a guess.\n\nIf it\'s correct, great. If not, we get feedback on B and K.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""DROVE"", we test D and V.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses, and this is the third guess.\n\nWe can afford to guess one of them.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that is not in the candidate set but tests letters that are in multiple candidates? But we cannot, because the pattern is fixed.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""GIVEN"", but that doesn\'t have R in second or O in third, so it would be inefficient.\n\nWe must stick to the pattern.\n\nSo, I think we should guess one of the candidates.\n\nI\'ll choose ""BROKE"" because B is a common starting letter.\n\nSo, third guess: BROKE\n\nBut let\'s confirm: B is not excluded, R is correct, O is correct, K is new, E is correct.\n\nIf the word is ""BROKE"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on B and K.\n\nFor example, if B is not in the word, then we know the first letter is not B, so it must be D, G, F, etc.\n\nSimilarly for K.\n\nBut K is in the fourth position.\n\nSo, I think it\'s a reasonable guess.\n\nAnother option: ""DROVE"" is also common.\n\nBut I\'ll go with ""BROKE"".\n\nSo, <guess>broke</guess>\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that tests more common letters.\n\nWhat about ""SHIRE""? But that doesn\'t fit the pattern: we need third letter O.\n\nNo.\n\nI think ""BROKE"" is fine.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).  \n    - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).  \n    - C, A, and N are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: trope** → Feedback: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).  \n    - R and E are confirmed in their positions (2nd and 5th).  \n    - T and P are not in the word.  \n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- The secret word has the pattern: **? R O ? E** (2nd letter: R, 3rd letter: O, 5th letter: E).  \n- Excluded letters: **C, A, N, T, P** (cannot appear in the word).  \n- Unknown positions: **1st and 4th letters**.  \n- Remaining possibilities for the 1st and 4th letters must be from the unused alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, S, V, W, etc.), and must form a valid English word.  \n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for the Next Guess:\n1. **Focus on the unknown positions**: We need to test potential letters for the 1st and 4th positions. Common letters not yet tested include B, D, S, L, M, and V.  \n2. **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: B, D, and S are very common in English, so testing them could quickly narrow down options.  \n3. **Generate valid word candidates**:  \n   - Possible words fitting **? R O ? E** and avoiding excluded letters (C, A, N, T, P) include:  \n     - **BROKE** (B in 1st, K in 4th)  \n     - **DROVE** (D in 1st, V in 4th)  \n     - **GROVE** (G in 1st, V in 4th)  \n     - **FROZE** (F in 1st, Z in 4th)  \n     - **BROME** (B in 1st, M in 4th)  \n   - Among these, **BROKE** and **DROVE** are common words and test high-frequency letters (B/D for 1st position, K/V for 4th position).  \n4. **Maximize information gain**:  \n   - Guessing **BROKE** tests B (common starting letter) and K. If B is correct, it confirms the 1st letter; if not, it eliminates B, pointing to alternatives like D or G. Similarly, K\'s feedback will help with the 4th position.  \n   - **BROKE** is chosen over **DROVE** because B is slightly more common than D as a starting letter, and it covers a different set of possibilities (e.g., if B is invalid, D and G become top candidates).  \n5. **Efficiency**: With only 6 guesses total, this guess could solve the puzzle if correct or provide critical constraints for the 4th guess.\n\n<guess>broke</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: trope -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: broke -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""broke"":
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)
- O: ✓ (correct position, third letter)
- K: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

So, combining all feedback:

Secret word pattern: _ R O _ E

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, P, B, K  (from all x's)

We also have O in the third position confirmed.

Now, we need to find the first and fourth letters. They must be letters not in the excluded set and form a valid English word.

Excluded: C, A, N, T, P, B, K.

So, available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should focus on common letters.

Possible words fitting _ R O _ E:

We had candidates earlier, but now B and K are excluded, so:

- BROKE is out (B excluded)
- DROVE: D, R, O, V, E -> D and V are not excluded
- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E -> G and V not excluded
- FROZE: F, R, O, Z, E -> F and Z not excluded
- BROME: B excluded

Also, other possibilities:
- SHROVE: not 5 letters? S H R O V E is 6 letters. Shrove is 6? Shrove is the past tense of shrive, but it's 6 letters? No, ""shrove"" is 6 letters? S-H-R-O-V-E? 6 characters. We need 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must be: [1st], R, O, [4th], E.

So:
- DROVE: D and V
- GROVE: G and V
- FROZE: F and Z
- Also, ""WROVE""? W R O V E? Is that a word? Wrove is not commonly used, but it might be accepted as an archaic form of weave? But let's avoid rare words.
- ""PROVE"": P excluded
- ""TROVE"": T excluded
- ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are common.
- Another one: ""GROPE"" but P excluded.

Also, ""TRODE"": T excluded and not common.

So, main candidates: DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

Now, we have to guess one of these? Or we can try to test multiple letters.

But we don't have a word that tests for both D and G, for example.

We could guess ""DROVE"" to test D and V.

Similarly, ""GROVE"" tests G and V.

If we guess ""DROVE"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on D and V.

Similarly for others.

To maximize information, we might guess a word that uses a common letter for the fourth position.

Note that V appears in both DROVE and GROVE. So if we test V and it's in the word, then the fourth letter is V, and the first letter must be D or G.

But we don't have a way to test V without using one of the candidate words.

Since we have only a few possibilities, we could guess one directly.

We have used 3 guesses and have 3 left? Or 3 made, so 3 more? Total 6, so guesses left: 3.

We can afford to guess.

But we might be able to solve in this guess.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests letters like S or L in the first position, but no such word exists in this pattern? For example, ""SROLE"" not a word.

So, we must choose from DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

Of these, DROVE and GROVE are very common, while FROZE is less common (froze is common, but FROZE would be F-R-O-Z-E, which is ""froze"", past of freeze, so it's valid).

To decide, we note that we haven't tested D, G, F, V, Z.

V is more common than Z, and D and G are both common.

But F is less common than D or G.

So, perhaps prioritize DROVE or GROVE over FROZE.

Let's look at common letters.

If we guess ""DROVE"":
- If D is in the first position and V in the fourth, it's correct.
- If D is not in the word, then D is x, and V might be - or x.

Similarly for GROVE.

But since V appears in both, if V is correct, then we know the fourth letter is V, and then we only need to test D vs G for first letter.

For example, if we guess ""DROVE"" and get:
- D: ✓? Then it must be DROVE.
- D: x? Then D is not first, so not DROVE. And if V is ✓ or -?

But positions: in DROVE, D is first, V is fourth.

If D is x, then the first letter is not D. Then if V is ✓, then fourth letter is V, so the word must be GROVE (since FROZE has Z, not V).

Similarly, if V is x, then it must be FROZE or other? But FROZE has Z, not V.

So:

If we guess ""DROVE"":
- Feedback possibilities:
  - If D(✓) and V(✓): word is DROVE.
  - If D(x) and V(✓): then D not first, V in fourth? Then first letter must be something else, but V in fourth implies the word must be GROVE (since FROZE has Z). So we know it's GROVE.
  - If D(✓) and V(x): impossible? Because if D is in first and correct, then the word is D R O ? E, and V not in word? But no candidate has D and not V? Only DROVE has D, so if D is correct but V not in word, then contradiction? Meaning DROVE is not the word, but D is first? Oh, wait.

Actually, if the word is GROVE, and we guess DROVE:
- First position: D vs G -> D not in word? So D: x (since G is there, and D not in word)
- Fourth position: V vs V -> if GROVE has V in fourth? Wait, GROVE is G R O V E, so fourth is V. So V is in the word and in the correct position? In ""DROVE"", we put V in fourth, so if the word is GROVE, V is still in fourth? Yes, so V should be ✓.

But D is not in the word? So D: x.

Similarly, if word is FROZE:
- Guess DROVE: D is not in word (x), R correct, O correct, V should be: not in word? Because FROZE has Z in fourth. So V: x, E correct.

Similarly, if word is GROVE and we guess DROVE: D: x (not in word), R: ✓, O: ✓, V: ✓ (correct position? In GROVE V is fourth? Yes, so V: ✓), E: ✓.

Now, feedback:
- For GROVE: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓)? But V is in the correct position? Yes.

But we don't know which letter is the fourth? The feedback would mark each position.

For DROVE guessed against GROVE:
- D in first: not the word? Since GROVE has G, so D: x (wrong)
- R: ✓
- O: ✓
- V in fourth: GROVE has V in fourth? Yes, so V: ✓
- E: ✓

But we also might get warnings about repeated letters? But no duplicates here.

Similarly, for FROZE vs DROVE:
- D: x
- R: ✓
- O: ✓
- V: x (FROZE has no V)
- E: ✓

So:

Case 1: word is DROVE → feedback: D(✓), R(✓), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓)

Case 2: word is GROVE → feedback: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓)  — here D(x) and V(✓) tell us it's GROVE? Almost.

Case 3: word is FROZE → feedback: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(x), E(✓)

So if after guessing DROVE, if we get all ✓ except D x? But we have R, O, E already ✓, so it must be V and E ✓? But in case of GROVE, V is ✓; in FROZE, V is x.

So:

- If we get D(✓) and V(✓), it's DROVE.
- If we get D(x) and V(✓), then it must be GROVE (since FROZE would not have V).
- If we get D(x) and V(x), then it must be FROZE.

Thus, by guessing DROVE, we can solve all cases with the feedback.

Similarly, if we guess GROVE, we can infer similarly.

For GROVE guessed against DROVE: similar outcomes.

But since we are at the third guess, and this is the fourth, we can choose either.

I'll choose DROVE because it starts with a common letter.

So, fourth guess: DROVE

If not, we'll know immediately.

But let's see: we have three possibilities left: DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

Guessing DROVE will tell us:

- If response has D(✓) and V(✓) → word is DROVE.
- If D(x) and V(✓) → word is GROVE.
- If D(x) and V(x) → word is FROZE.

So it's perfect.

We should guess DROVE.

After analyzing the cumulative feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: ✓ for R (2nd position) and E (5th position); x for C, A, N.
- **Guess 2: trope** → Feedback: ✓ for R (2nd position), O (3rd position), and E (5th position); x for T, P.
- **Guess 3: broke** → Feedback: ✓ for R (2nd position), O (3rd position), and E (5th position); x for B, K.

### Key Insights:
1. **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is **? R O ? E** (2nd letter: R, 3rd letter: O, 5th letter: E).
2. **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, T, P, B, K (cannot be in the word).
3. **Unknown positions**: The 1st and 4th letters must be valid English letters not in the excluded set.
4. **Remaining possibilities**: Based on common words, the secret word could be:
   - **DROVE** (D in 1st, V in 4th)
   - **GROVE** (G in 1st, V in 4th)
   - **FROZE** (F in 1st, Z in 4th)

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- **DROVE** tests high-frequency letters (D and V) and maximizes information gain:
  - If D is ✓ and V is ✓, the word is **DROVE**.
  - If D is x and V is ✓, the word must be **GROVE** (since V matches the 4th position).
  - If D is x and V is x, the word must be **FROZE**.
- This guess resolves all remaining possibilities efficiently, leveraging the feedback to pinpoint the word in one attempt.

<guess>drove</guess>",drove,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""broke"":
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)
- O: ✓ (correct position, third letter)
- K: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

So, combining all feedback:

Secret word pattern: _ R O _ E

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, P, B, K  (from all x's)

We also have O in the third position confirmed.

Now, we need to find the first and fourth letters. They must be letters not in the excluded set and form a valid English word.

Excluded: C, A, N, T, P, B, K.

So, available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should focus on common letters.

Possible words fitting _ R O _ E:

We had candidates earlier, but now B and K are excluded, so:

- BROKE is out (B excluded)
- DROVE: D, R, O, V, E -> D and V are not excluded
- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E -> G and V not excluded
- FROZE: F, R, O, Z, E -> F and Z not excluded
- BROME: B excluded

Also, other possibilities:
- SHROVE: not 5 letters? S H R O V E is 6 letters. Shrove is 6? Shrove is the past tense of shrive, but it's 6 letters? No, ""shrove"" is 6 letters? S-H-R-O-V-E? 6 characters. We need 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must be: [1st], R, O, [4th], E.

So:
- DROVE: D and V
- GROVE: G and V
- FROZE: F and Z
- Also, ""WROVE""? W R O V E? Is that a word? Wrove is not commonly used, but it might be accepted as an archaic form of weave? But let's avoid rare words.
- ""PROVE"": P excluded
- ""TROVE"": T excluded
- ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are common.
- Another one: ""GROPE"" but P excluded.

Also, ""TRODE"": T excluded and not common.

So, main candidates: DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

Now, we have to guess one of these? Or we can try to test multiple letters.

But we don't have a word that tests for both D and G, for example.

We could guess ""DROVE"" to test D and V.

Similarly, ""GROVE"" tests G and V.

If we guess ""DROVE"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on D and V.

Similarly for others.

To maximize information, we might guess a word that uses a common letter for the fourth position.

Note that V appears in both DROVE and GROVE. So if we test V and it's in the word, then the fourth letter is V, and the first letter must be D or G.

But we don't have a way to test V without using one of the candidate words.

Since we have only a few possibilities, we could guess one directly.

We have used 3 guesses and have 3 left? Or 3 made, so 3 more? Total 6, so guesses left: 3.

We can afford to guess.

But we might be able to solve in this guess.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests letters like S or L in the first position, but no such word exists in this pattern? For example, ""SROLE"" not a word.

So, we must choose from DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

Of these, DROVE and GROVE are very common, while FROZE is less common (froze is common, but FROZE would be F-R-O-Z-E, which is ""froze"", past of freeze, so it's valid).

To decide, we note that we haven't tested D, G, F, V, Z.

V is more common than Z, and D and G are both common.

But F is less common than D or G.

So, perhaps prioritize DROVE or GROVE over FROZE.

Let's look at common letters.

If we guess ""DROVE"":
- If D is in the first position and V in the fourth, it's correct.
- If D is not in the word, then D is x, and V might be - or x.

Similarly for GROVE.

But since V appears in both, if V is correct, then we know the fourth letter is V, and then we only need to test D vs G for first letter.

For example, if we guess ""DROVE"" and get:
- D: ✓? Then it must be DROVE.
- D: x? Then D is not first, so not DROVE. And if V is ✓ or -?

But positions: in DROVE, D is first, V is fourth.

If D is x, then the first letter is not D. Then if V is ✓, then fourth letter is V, so the word must be GROVE (since FROZE has Z, not V).

Similarly, if V is x, then it must be FROZE or other? But FROZE has Z, not V.

So:

If we guess ""DROVE"":
- Feedback possibilities:
  - If D(✓) and V(✓): word is DROVE.
  - If D(x) and V(✓): then D not first, V in fourth? Then first letter must be something else, but V in fourth implies the word must be GROVE (since FROZE has Z). So we know it's GROVE.
  - If D(✓) and V(x): impossible? Because if D is in first and correct, then the word is D R O ? E, and V not in word? But no candidate has D and not V? Only DROVE has D, so if D is correct but V not in word, then contradiction? Meaning DROVE is not the word, but D is first? Oh, wait.

Actually, if the word is GROVE, and we guess DROVE:
- First position: D vs G -> D not in word? So D: x (since G is there, and D not in word)
- Fourth position: V vs V -> if GROVE has V in fourth? Wait, GROVE is G R O V E, so fourth is V. So V is in the word and in the correct position? In ""DROVE"", we put V in fourth, so if the word is GROVE, V is still in fourth? Yes, so V should be ✓.

But D is not in the word? So D: x.

Similarly, if word is FROZE:
- Guess DROVE: D is not in word (x), R correct, O correct, V should be: not in word? Because FROZE has Z in fourth. So V: x, E correct.

Similarly, if word is GROVE and we guess DROVE: D: x (not in word), R: ✓, O: ✓, V: ✓ (correct position? In GROVE V is fourth? Yes, so V: ✓), E: ✓.

Now, feedback:
- For GROVE: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓)? But V is in the correct position? Yes.

But we don't know which letter is the fourth? The feedback would mark each position.

For DROVE guessed against GROVE:
- D in first: not the word? Since GROVE has G, so D: x (wrong)
- R: ✓
- O: ✓
- V in fourth: GROVE has V in fourth? Yes, so V: ✓
- E: ✓

But we also might get warnings about repeated letters? But no duplicates here.

Similarly, for FROZE vs DROVE:
- D: x
- R: ✓
- O: ✓
- V: x (FROZE has no V)
- E: ✓

So:

Case 1: word is DROVE → feedback: D(✓), R(✓), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓)

Case 2: word is GROVE → feedback: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓)  — here D(x) and V(✓) tell us it's GROVE? Almost.

Case 3: word is FROZE → feedback: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(x), E(✓)

So if after guessing DROVE, if we get all ✓ except D x? But we have R, O, E already ✓, so it must be V and E ✓? But in case of GROVE, V is ✓; in FROZE, V is x.

So:

- If we get D(✓) and V(✓), it's DROVE.
- If we get D(x) and V(✓), then it must be GROVE (since FROZE would not have V).
- If we get D(x) and V(x), then it must be FROZE.

Thus, by guessing DROVE, we can solve all cases with the feedback.

Similarly, if we guess GROVE, we can infer similarly.

For GROVE guessed against DROVE: similar outcomes.

But since we are at the third guess, and this is the fourth, we can choose either.

I'll choose DROVE because it starts with a common letter.

So, fourth guess: DROVE

If not, we'll know immediately.

But let's see: we have three possibilities left: DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

Guessing DROVE will tell us:

- If response has D(✓) and V(✓) → word is DROVE.
- If D(x) and V(✓) → word is GROVE.
- If D(x) and V(x) → word is FROZE.

So it's perfect.

We should guess DROVE.After analyzing the cumulative feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: ✓ for R (2nd position) and E (5th position); x for C, A, N.
- **Guess 2: trope** → Feedback: ✓ for R (2nd position), O (3rd position), and E (5th position); x for T, P.
- **Guess 3: broke** → Feedback: ✓ for R (2nd position), O (3rd position), and E (5th position); x for B, K.

### Key Insights:
1. **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is **? R O ? E** (2nd letter: R, 3rd letter: O, 5th letter: E).

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

So we know:
- The second letter is R.
- The fifth letter is E.
- The letters C, A, N are not in the word.

Therefore, the word has the form: _ R _ _ E

We also know that the word does not contain C, A, or N.

Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to use other common letters to uncover more information.

We know the word has R in the second position and E at the end. We need to find the first, third, and fourth letters.

We should avoid using C, A, N.

Common vowels we haven't tried: O, I, U (but we already tried A and E, and E is in). We also have E at the end, so the word might have another vowel? We don't know.

Common consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.

We can try a word that has:
- First position: a new vowel or consonant (but not C, A, N)
- Third position: a vowel? (since we have R and then a letter, then two more and then E)
- Fourth position: a consonant?

We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ E and that don't contain C, A, N.

But note: we are not required to guess a word that fits the pattern exactly because we are still in the process of gathering information. We can guess a word that doesn't fit the pattern to test other letters.

However, if we can guess a word that fits the pattern and tests new letters, that would be ideal.

But we don't know the first, third, and fourth letters. So we can try a word that has R in the second position and E at the end, and uses new letters for the other positions.

Possible words: 
- PRIDE: P, R, I, D, E -> but we don't know if P, I, D are in the word.
- BRINE: but B is new, but we have N which is excluded (from previous feedback, N is not in the word) so we cannot use BRINE because it has N.
- TRIPE: T, R, I, P, E -> T, I, P are new and we avoid C, A, N.

But let's check: TRIPE: T (first), R (second, correct), I (third), P (fourth), E (fifth, correct). This uses T, I, P which are new and not excluded.

Alternatively, we could try a word that doesn't have E at the end to test other positions? But we know E is at the end, so if we put E in a different position, we might get a '-' if it's present elsewhere? But the feedback for E in the first guess was in the fifth position and correct, so E is only in the fifth position? Not necessarily, it could be elsewhere too? The feedback only tells us about the positions we guessed.

In the first guess, we had E at the fifth position and it was correct. But the word might have another E? However, we don't know. But the feedback for E was a check, meaning it is in the word and in that position. It doesn't say anything about other E's.

But in the feedback, we only get information about the letters we guessed. So if the word has two E's, we wouldn't know until we guess an E in another position.

But for now, we know at least one E is at the end.

So, for the second guess, we can try to use a word that has E in the fifth position and R in the second, and new letters elsewhere.

Let me list some words that fit _ R _ _ E and don't have C, A, N:

- GRIME: G, R, I, M, E
- PRICE: but C is excluded, so no.
- BRIDE: B, R, I, D, E
- TRITE: T, R, I, T, E -> but T is repeated, might be less informative.
- DRIVE: D, R, I, V, E
- WRITE: W, R, I, T, E

We want to test as many new letters as possible. We have not tried: B, D, G, I, M, P, T, V, W, etc.

I think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate: it uses W, R, I, T, E. We know R and E are in the word and in the correct positions. We are testing W, I, T.

Similarly, ""DRIVE"" tests D, I, V.

But note: we are not limited to words that have R and E in the correct positions? We can guess a word without R in the second or E in the fifth? But that might not be efficient because we know R must be in the second and E in the fifth. If we put R elsewhere, we might get a '-' if it's present, but we already know it's in the second. Similarly for E.

But if we put R in a different position, we might get a '-' for R in that position? But we know the word has R in the second, so if we put R in the first, it would be wrong and we might get a '-' if there is another R? But we don't know if there are duplicate letters.

However, to maximize information, it might be better to avoid putting known letters in positions we know they are not? But we don't know about duplicates.

Alternatively, we can stick to the pattern and test new letters.

I think ""WRITE"" is a good guess because:
- It has W (new), R (correct), I (new), T (new), E (correct).
- We can see if W, I, T are in the word and in which positions.

Similarly, ""PRIDE"" (P, R, I, D, E) is also good.

But let's choose one. I'll go with ""WRITE"".

So, second guess: WRITE

But note: we are not forced to use the pattern. We could also try a word that doesn't have R in the second or E in the fifth to test for other letters? But that might be less efficient because we are not using the known information.

For example, if we guess a word without R in the second, then we might get a '-' for R in a different position, which would tell us if there is another R? But we don't know if there is a duplicate.

But since we have limited guesses, it's better to focus on the known pattern and test new letters.

I think ""WRITE"" is a reasonable choice.

Alternatively, we could try a word that has a different set of letters to cover more common ones. For example, we haven't tried S, L, O, etc.

But in ""WRITE"", we are testing W, I, T. W is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.

How about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E -> tests P, I, D.

Or ""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> tests B, I, D.

But we don't know if B, I, D are in the word.

Another common word: ""TRICE"" but C is excluded.

""ROUSE"": but R is in the first position? We need R in the second? Actually, in ""ROUSE"", R is first, but we know R is second in the target. So if we guess ""ROUSE"", we would have:
- R in first: if the word has R only in the second, then R in first would be marked as not in the word? No, the feedback would be: R is in the word but in the wrong position (because the target has R in second, so R is present) so we would get a '-' for R? But we already know R is in the word. So it doesn't give new information about R. Similarly, we know E is in the fifth, but if we put E in the fourth? Then we might get a '-' for E if it is also elsewhere? But we don't know.

So to avoid confusion, it's better to keep R in the second and E in the fifth and test the other positions.

Therefore, I'll go with ""PRIDE"".

But let me see: we have to avoid C, A, N. ""PRIDE"" has P, R, I, D, E. All new.

Similarly, ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.

I think ""PRIDE"" is a good choice.

But let me think of the most common letters. After vowels, common consonants are T, S, L, R (we have R), D, etc.

So including T and D might be good.

""TRIDE"" is not a word. ""BRIDE"" is a word: B, R, I, D, E.

Or ""GRIDE"" is not common. ""PRIDE"" is common.

But ""PRIDE"" doesn't have T. How about ""TRIPE""? T, R, I, P, E.

""TRIPE"" is a word (meaning a part of the stomach of an animal, or to rip off? but it's valid).

But ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.

Alternatively, ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E.

I think I'll go with ""PRIDE"" because it's a common word.

But let me check: we are testing P, I, D. We already know R and E are in place.

So, second guess: PRIDE

But note: we are not sure if the word has I or D or P. We are testing them.

Alternatively, we could use a word that has S, because S is very common. But we cannot put S in the second or fifth? We can put S in the first, third, or fourth.

For example, ""RICES"" but C is excluded and S at the end? But we have E at the end, so we cannot have S at the end. The pattern is _ R _ _ E, so the fourth letter is before E. So we can have S in the first, third, or fourth.

But we don't have a word that fits and has S? For example, ""RUSHE"" is not a word. ""ARISE"" but A is excluded. ""ERASE"" but E is at the beginning? And A is excluded? ""ERASE"" has A, which is excluded.

""RISE"" is only 4 letters. ""PRISE"" is a word: P, R, I, S, E -> but that fits: _ R _ _ E -> PRISE: P (first), R (second), I (third), S (fourth), E (fifth). And it has S.

But we don't know if S is in the word. And we avoid A, C, N? PRISE: P, R, I, S, E. No A, C, N.

So ""PRISE"" is a valid guess and it tests P, I, S.

S is more common than D? So maybe ""PRISE"" is better than ""PRIDE"".

Similarly, ""BRISE"" is not a word.

So I think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: PRISE is a word? It means to force open or a lever, but it's accepted in word games.

Alternatively, ""RAISE"" but A is excluded.

So, I'll go with ""PRISE"".

But we have to decide.

Another common word: ""TRICE"" is invalid because of C.

""ROUTE"" but O is new, but R is in first? We need R in second.

I think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.

But let me see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can use ""TRITE"" but it has T repeated? Not ideal.

I think ""PRISE"" is a solid choice.

So, second guess: PRISE

But note: we are not required to use the pattern? But it's efficient.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that doesn't have R in the second to test for other letters? But that might waste the known information.

I think sticking to the pattern is better.

So, I'll go with ""PRISE"".

But let me think of the word list. Is ""PRISE"" common? It might be less common than ""PRIDE"", but it's valid.

Another option: ""BRINE"" but N is excluded, so no.

""CRIME"" but C is excluded.

""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> tests D, I, V.

V is less common.

""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> tests W, I, T.

W is less common.

So among the options, ""PRISE"" (with S) or ""PRIDE"" (with D) or ""TRIPE"" (with T and P).

I think S is more common than D or T? Actually, T is more common than S? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have E and R, and we've excluded A, N, C. So we haven't tried I, O, T, S, L.

So we should try to cover I, O, T, S, L.

In one guess, we can test multiple.

In ""PRISE"", we test P, I, S. We are missing O, T, L.

In ""TRIPE"", we test T, I, P. Missing O, S, L.

In ""TOILE"" but O and I, but T in first? And we need R in second? Not matching.

We can't cover all in one guess.

But we can try to cover as many as possible.

Another word: ""ROLES"" but R is first? We need R second. If we guess ""ROLES"", we get:
- R: if the word has R only in second, then R in first would be marked as '-' (wrong position) and we already know R is in the word, so it doesn't help. Similarly, E is at the end? But we have E in fifth? In ""ROLES"", E is fourth? So we might get information about E? But we know E is in fifth, so if we put E in fourth, we might get a '-' if there is another E? But we don't know.

But to test more common letters, we could guess a word that has O, T, S, L, and avoid known bad letters.

For example, ""SLATE"" but A is excluded and we have E at the end? But in ""SLATE"", E is fifth, which is correct. But A is excluded, so we cannot use ""SLATE"".

""SLOPE"": S, L, O, P, E -> E at the end is correct. But we don't have R in the second? So we are not using the known R position.

But we can test S, L, O, P. And we know E is at the end.

But we are not testing the first, third, and fourth positions of the pattern? We are testing a completely different word.

This might be acceptable because we can get information about S, L, O, P.

But we know the word has R in the second position, so if we don't include R in the guess, we won't get information about other positions of R? But we already know R is in the word and in the second position, so if we don't include R, we don't learn anything new about R. But we are testing other letters.

However, we have only 6 guesses, so we need to balance.

I think for the second guess, it's better to use the known information and test the unknown positions.

Therefore, I'll stick with a word that has R in the second and E in the fifth.

Let me choose ""PRISE"".

So, second guess: PRISE

But to be more confident, let me see if there's a word that includes T and O? But I can't think of one that fits _ R _ _ E without excluded letters.

""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E -> that fits! And O is a common vowel we haven't tried.

""TROPE"" is a word (meaning a recurring theme). And it has T, R, O, P, E. We test T, O, P.

O is a vowel we haven't tried, which is good.

So ""TROPE"" might be better than ""PRISE"" because we test O instead of S, and O is a vowel.

Similarly, we test T and P.

So I think ""TROPE"" is a good choice.

Therefore, I'll go with ""TROPE"".

Second guess: TROPE

In summary, we are guessing ""TROPE"" to test T, O, P in the context of the pattern _ R _ _ E.

So, the guess is ""trope"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is not in the word (x).
- R is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).
- A is not in the word (x).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the correct position (fifth letter) (✓).

This reveals:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E.
- The letters C, A, and N are excluded.
- The second letter is R, and the fifth letter is E.

For the second guess, I need to test new letters to uncover the first, third, and fourth positions. I should prioritize common vowels and consonants not yet tried (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, D) while avoiding C, A, and N. The word ""trope"" fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and includes:
- T (new, tests first position),
- R (known, second position),
- O (new vowel, tests third position),
- P (new, tests fourth position),
- E (known, fifth position).

This guess efficiently tests three new letters (T, O, P) and maintains the known R and E positions, maximizing information gain.

<guess>trope</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: trope -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)

Guess 2: ""trope""
- T: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)
- O: ✓ (correct position, so O is the third letter)
- P: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

From this, we know:
- The word has the pattern: _ R O _ E
- The second letter is R, third is O, fifth is E.
- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, P (from the x's)
- We also know that O is in the third position and is correct.

So the word is of the form: _ R O _ E

We need to find the first and fourth letters.

We have excluded: C, A, N, T, P.

We have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, P.

Remaining common letters: We should try to use common consonants and vowels that haven't been tried. We haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a valid 5-letter word.

The first letter: it must be a letter not excluded, so not C, A, N, T, P.

The fourth letter: similarly, not excluded.

We know the word has R, O, E, and two more letters.

We can think of words that fit _ R O _ E.

Possible words:
- PROBE: but P is excluded, so no.
- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E -> G and V are new.
- DROVE: D, R, O, V, E -> D and V new.
- PROSE: P excluded.
- ROUTE: but U is in fourth? And T is excluded? T is excluded, so no.
- BROKE: B, R, O, K, E -> B and K new.
- FROZE: F, R, O, Z, E -> F and Z new.
- GROPE: P excluded.
- TROVE: T excluded.

We need to avoid the excluded letters.

So, let's list possible words:
- GROVE
- DROVE
- BROKE
- FROZE
- Also, ""WROTE"": but T is excluded, so no.
- ""BRIDE"": but I is in third? We need O in third. Pattern is _ R O _ E, so third must be O.

Another one: ""AROSE"" but A is excluded.

""CRONE"" but C excluded.

""DRONE"": D, R, O, N, E -> but N is excluded? From guess 1, N is not in the word, so no.

""PRONE"": P excluded.

""TRONE"": T excluded.

""SHONE"": S, H, O, N, E -> but N excluded.

""PHONE"": P and N excluded.

""SCONE"": S, C, O, N, E -> C and N excluded.

So, back to:
- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E
- DROVE: D, R, O, V, E
- BROKE: B, R, O, K, E
- FROZE: F, R, O, Z, E
- Also, ""TRODE"": but T excluded? TRODE has T, so no.
- ""BROME"": B, R, O, M, E -> is that a word? Brome is a type of grass, I think it's valid.
- ""GROPE"": P excluded.
- ""CRORE"": C excluded.

Another one: ""PROLE"": P excluded.

""WROTE"": T excluded.

""WROKE"": not common, and W is first? But we can check.

But let's focus on common words.

We also have ""IRONE"": but I is first? And N excluded? No.

""GRACE"": C and A excluded.

So, possible candidates: GROVE, DROVE, BROKE, FROZE, and BROME.

We need to choose one that tests new letters.

We have to guess one of these, but we don't know which one. We can use a guess that includes letters that are common to narrow down.

But we have only one position unknown? Actually, two positions: first and fourth.

We know the pattern: first letter and fourth letter are missing.

We can try to guess a word that has letters that appear in many possibilities.

For example, among the candidates:
- GROVE: G and V
- DROVE: D and V
- BROKE: B and K
- FROZE: F and Z
- BROME: B and M

We see that V appears in GROVE and DROVE, B appears in BROKE and BROME, etc.

But we don't have a word that can test multiple at once because the pattern is fixed.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily in the candidate set but tests common letters for the first and fourth positions.

For example, we can guess a word that has S or L or I in the first or fourth position? But we have to fit the pattern _ R O _ E.

But we cannot change the known positions.

We must have R in second, O in third, E in fifth.

So the only flexibility is the first and fourth.

We can try to use a word that has a common letter in the first position and another in the fourth.

Common letters for first position: we haven't tried S, B, D, G, etc.

Common letters for fourth position: similarly.

But we need to form a valid word.

Let me list all possible words that fit _ R O _ E and don't use excluded letters (C, A, N, T, P).

Possible first letters: any letter except C, A, N, T, P and also not used? But we can use any except excluded.

Excluded: C, A, N, T, P.

So first letter can be: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But it must form a word with R O _ E.

Similarly, fourth letter: same set.

Now, let's think of words:

- B: BROME, BROKE (if valid)
- D: DROVE
- F: FROZE, FROME? (not common)
- G: GROVE, GROPE (P excluded), GROLE? no
- H: HROSE? no
- I: IROKE? no
- K: KROME? not common
- L: LROSE? no, but ""LROE"" no. ""LROME""? no. Actually, is there a word like ""LRO_E""? I can't think of one.
- M: MROME? no
- Q: QROME? no
- S: SROBE? no, ""SROKE""? no. ""SHROVE""? but H is in second? No, pattern is _ R O _ E, so ""SHROVE"" is S H R O V E? That's 6 letters. No, 5 letters: S, H, R, O, E? But then it would be S H R O E, which doesn't have O in third? Third is R? No: positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:R, 4:O, 5:E? But we need second to be R and third to be O. So ""SHROE"" is not a word and doesn't fit pattern.

We need the third letter to be O, so the word must be [letter1] R O [letter4] E.

So for S: is there a word ""SRO_E""? Like ""SROME""? Not a word. ""STROKE"" has T and is 6 letters? 5: S T R O K E? 6 letters. 5-letter: ""SROPE"" but P excluded and O is third? S R O P E? But P excluded.

Similarly, ""SROLE""? Not a word.

U: ""UROPE""? Not a word. Europe is 6.

V: ""VROME""? no.

W: ""WROSE""? no, ""WROKE"" has K and E? W R O K E? But that fits the pattern: W first, R second, O third, K fourth, E fifth. And ""wroke"" is not common, but ""wreak"" is different. ""WROKE"" might be archaic for ""wreaked"", but it's not commonly used. In Wordle, it might not be accepted.

Similarly, ""WROTE"" has T excluded.

X, Y, Z: unlikely.

So the common ones are: GROVE, DROVE, BROKE, FROZE, BROME.

BROME: is it valid? Brome is a type of grass, so yes.

FROZE: not a word, but ""froze"" is the past of freeze, which is F R O Z E, so 5 letters: F, R, O, Z, E. That fits.

Similarly, BROKE: B, R, O, K, E.

DROVE: D, R, O, V, E.

GROVE: G, R, O, V, E.

Also, ""TRODE"" is not common and T excluded.

Another one: ""GROSS"" but not ending with E.

So, we have a few possibilities.

We need to guess one of them, but we can also use a guess that tests a letter that appears in multiple possibilities.

For example, V appears in GROVE and DROVE.

B appears in BROKE and BROME.

K appears in BROKE.

Z appears in FROZE.

M appears in BROME.

G appears only in GROVE.

D appears only in DROVE.

F appears only in FROZE.

So if we guess a word that has, say, B, then if B is in the word, it must be in first position, and then we can narrow down.

Similarly for V, if V is in the word, it must be in fourth position.

But we don't have a word that tests B and V together? Not in this pattern.

We have to guess one of the candidates.

We can also consider that we have not tried S, L, I, etc., but they don't form words in this pattern.

So, we must choose from the candidates.

To maximize information, we can choose a word that has a common letter. For example, B is more common than Z or V.

BROKE has B and K.

But K is less common.

DROVE has D and V.

GROVE has G and V.

FROZE has F and Z.

BROME has B and M.

Among the first letters, B, D, G, F are all possible.

We can try ""BROKE"" as a guess.

If it's correct, great. If not, we get feedback on B and K.

Similarly, if we guess ""DROVE"", we test D and V.

But we have only 6 guesses, and this is the third guess.

We can afford to guess one of them.

But let's see the feedback we might get.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that is not in the candidate set but tests letters that are in multiple candidates? But we cannot, because the pattern is fixed.

For example, if we guess ""GIVEN"", but that doesn't have R in second or O in third, so it would be inefficient.

We must stick to the pattern.

So, I think we should guess one of the candidates.

I'll choose ""BROKE"" because B is a common starting letter.

So, third guess: BROKE

But let's confirm: B is not excluded, R is correct, O is correct, K is new, E is correct.

If the word is ""BROKE"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on B and K.

For example, if B is not in the word, then we know the first letter is not B, so it must be D, G, F, etc.

Similarly for K.

But K is in the fourth position.

So, I think it's a reasonable guess.

Another option: ""DROVE"" is also common.

But I'll go with ""BROKE"".

So, <guess>broke</guess>

But let me see if there's a word that tests more common letters.

What about ""SHIRE""? But that doesn't fit the pattern: we need third letter O.

No.

I think ""BROKE"" is fine.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).  
    - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).  
    - C, A, and N are not in the word.  

- **Guess 2: trope** → Feedback: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)  
  - This reveals:  
    - O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).  
    - R and E are confirmed in their positions (2nd and 5th).  
    - T and P are not in the word.  

### Current Knowledge:
- The secret word has the pattern: **? R O ? E** (2nd letter: R, 3rd letter: O, 5th letter: E).  
- Excluded letters: **C, A, N, T, P** (cannot appear in the word).  
- Unknown positions: **1st and 4th letters**.  
- Remaining possibilities for the 1st and 4th letters must be from the unused alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, S, V, W, etc.), and must form a valid English word.  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning for the Next Guess:
1. **Focus on the unknown positions**: We need to test potential letters for the 1st and 4th positions. Common letters not yet tested include B, D, S, L, M, and V.  
2. **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: B, D, and S are very common in English, so testing them could quickly narrow down options.  
3. **Generate valid word candidates**:  
   - Possible words fitting **? R O ? E** and avoiding excluded letters (C, A, N, T, P) include:  
     - **BROKE** (B in 1st, K in 4th)  
     - **DROVE** (D in 1st, V in 4th)  
     - **GROVE** (G in 1st, V in 4th)  
     - **FROZE** (F in 1st, Z in 4th)  
     - **BROME** (B in 1st, M in 4th)  
   - Among these, **BROKE** and **DROVE** are common words and test high-frequency letters (B/D for 1st position, K/V for 4th position).  
4. **Maximize information gain**:  
   - Guessing **BROKE** tests B (common starting letter) and K. If B is correct, it confirms the 1st letter; if not, it eliminates B, pointing to alternatives like D or G. Similarly, K's feedback will help with the 4th position.  
   - **BROKE** is chosen over **DROVE** because B is slightly more common than D as a starting letter, and it covers a different set of possibilities (e.g., if B is invalid, D and G become top candidates).  
5. **Efficiency**: With only 6 guesses total, this guess could solve the puzzle if correct or provide critical constraints for the 4th guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the third guess ""broke"":
- B: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)
- O: ✓ (correct position, third letter)
- K: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

So, combining all feedback:

Secret word pattern: _ R O _ E

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, P, B, K  (from all x's)

We also have O in the third position confirmed.

Now, we need to find the first and fourth letters. They must be letters not in the excluded set and form a valid English word.

Excluded: C, A, N, T, P, B, K.

So, available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should focus on common letters.

Possible words fitting _ R O _ E:

We had candidates earlier, but now B and K are excluded, so:

- BROKE is out (B excluded)
- DROVE: D, R, O, V, E -> D and V are not excluded
- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E -> G and V not excluded
- FROZE: F, R, O, Z, E -> F and Z not excluded
- BROME: B excluded

Also, other possibilities:
- SHROVE: not 5 letters? S H R O V E is 6 letters. Shrove is 6? Shrove is the past tense of shrive, but it's 6 letters? No, ""shrove"" is 6 letters? S-H-R-O-V-E? 6 characters. We need 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must be: [1st], R, O, [4th], E.

So:
- DROVE: D and V
- GROVE: G and V
- FROZE: F and Z
- Also, ""WROVE""? W R O V E? Is that a word? Wrove is not commonly used, but it might be accepted as an archaic form of weave? But let's avoid rare words.
- ""PROVE"": P excluded
- ""TROVE"": T excluded
- ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are common.
- Another one: ""GROPE"" but P excluded.

Also, ""TRODE"": T excluded and not common.

So, main candidates: DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

Now, we have to guess one of these? Or we can try to test multiple letters.

But we don't have a word that tests for both D and G, for example.

We could guess ""DROVE"" to test D and V.

Similarly, ""GROVE"" tests G and V.

If we guess ""DROVE"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on D and V.

Similarly for others.

To maximize information, we might guess a word that uses a common letter for the fourth position.

Note that V appears in both DROVE and GROVE. So if we test V and it's in the word, then the fourth letter is V, and the first letter must be D or G.

But we don't have a way to test V without using one of the candidate words.

Since we have only a few possibilities, we could guess one directly.

We have used 3 guesses and have 3 left? Or 3 made, so 3 more? Total 6, so guesses left: 3.

We can afford to guess.

But we might be able to solve in this guess.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests letters like S or L in the first position, but no such word exists in this pattern? For example, ""SROLE"" not a word.

So, we must choose from DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

Of these, DROVE and GROVE are very common, while FROZE is less common (froze is common, but FROZE would be F-R-O-Z-E, which is ""froze"", past of freeze, so it's valid).

To decide, we note that we haven't tested D, G, F, V, Z.

V is more common than Z, and D and G are both common.

But F is less common than D or G.

So, perhaps prioritize DROVE or GROVE over FROZE.

Let's look at common letters.

If we guess ""DROVE"":
- If D is in the first position and V in the fourth, it's correct.
- If D is not in the word, then D is x, and V might be - or x.

Similarly for GROVE.

But since V appears in both, if V is correct, then we know the fourth letter is V, and then we only need to test D vs G for first letter.

For example, if we guess ""DROVE"" and get:
- D: ✓? Then it must be DROVE.
- D: x? Then D is not first, so not DROVE. And if V is ✓ or -?

But positions: in DROVE, D is first, V is fourth.

If D is x, then the first letter is not D. Then if V is ✓, then fourth letter is V, so the word must be GROVE (since FROZE has Z, not V).

Similarly, if V is x, then it must be FROZE or other? But FROZE has Z, not V.

So:

If we guess ""DROVE"":
- Feedback possibilities:
  - If D(✓) and V(✓): word is DROVE.
  - If D(x) and V(✓): then D not first, V in fourth? Then first letter must be something else, but V in fourth implies the word must be GROVE (since FROZE has Z). So we know it's GROVE.
  - If D(✓) and V(x): impossible? Because if D is in first and correct, then the word is D R O ? E, and V not in word? But no candidate has D and not V? Only DROVE has D, so if D is correct but V not in word, then contradiction? Meaning DROVE is not the word, but D is first? Oh, wait.

Actually, if the word is GROVE, and we guess DROVE:
- First position: D vs G -> D not in word? So D: x (since G is there, and D not in word)
- Fourth position: V vs V -> if GROVE has V in fourth? Wait, GROVE is G R O V E, so fourth is V. So V is in the word and in the correct position? In ""DROVE"", we put V in fourth, so if the word is GROVE, V is still in fourth? Yes, so V should be ✓.

But D is not in the word? So D: x.

Similarly, if word is FROZE:
- Guess DROVE: D is not in word (x), R correct, O correct, V should be: not in word? Because FROZE has Z in fourth. So V: x, E correct.

Similarly, if word is GROVE and we guess DROVE: D: x (not in word), R: ✓, O: ✓, V: ✓ (correct position? In GROVE V is fourth? Yes, so V: ✓), E: ✓.

Now, feedback:
- For GROVE: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓)? But V is in the correct position? Yes.

But we don't know which letter is the fourth? The feedback would mark each position.

For DROVE guessed against GROVE:
- D in first: not the word? Since GROVE has G, so D: x (wrong)
- R: ✓
- O: ✓
- V in fourth: GROVE has V in fourth? Yes, so V: ✓
- E: ✓

But we also might get warnings about repeated letters? But no duplicates here.

Similarly, for FROZE vs DROVE:
- D: x
- R: ✓
- O: ✓
- V: x (FROZE has no V)
- E: ✓

So:

Case 1: word is DROVE → feedback: D(✓), R(✓), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓)

Case 2: word is GROVE → feedback: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓)  — here D(x) and V(✓) tell us it's GROVE? Almost.

Case 3: word is FROZE → feedback: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(x), E(✓)

So if after guessing DROVE, if we get all ✓ except D x? But we have R, O, E already ✓, so it must be V and E ✓? But in case of GROVE, V is ✓; in FROZE, V is x.

So:

- If we get D(✓) and V(✓), it's DROVE.
- If we get D(x) and V(✓), then it must be GROVE (since FROZE would not have V).
- If we get D(x) and V(x), then it must be FROZE.

Thus, by guessing DROVE, we can solve all cases with the feedback.

Similarly, if we guess GROVE, we can infer similarly.

For GROVE guessed against DROVE: similar outcomes.

But since we are at the third guess, and this is the fourth, we can choose either.

I'll choose DROVE because it starts with a common letter.

So, fourth guess: DROVE

If not, we'll know immediately.

But let's see: we have three possibilities left: DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.

Guessing DROVE will tell us:

- If response has D(✓) and V(✓) → word is DROVE.
- If D(x) and V(✓) → word is GROVE.
- If D(x) and V(x) → word is FROZE.

So it's perfect.

We should guess DROVE.After analyzing the cumulative feedback:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: ✓ for R (2nd position) and E (5th position); x for C, A, N.
- **Guess 2: trope** → Feedback: ✓ for R (2nd position), O (3rd position), and E (5th position); x for T, P.
- **Guess 3: broke** → Feedback: ✓ for R (2nd position), O (3rd position), and E (5th position); x for B, K.

### Key Insights:
1. **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is **? R O ? E** (2nd letter: R, 3rd letter: O, 5th letter: E).
2. **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, T, P, B, K (cannot be in the word).
3. **Unknown positions**: The 1st and 4th letters must be valid English letters not in the excluded set.
4. **Remaining possibilities**: Based on common words, the secret word could be:
   - **DROVE** (D in 1st, V in 4th)
   - **GROVE** (G in 1st, V in 4th)
   - **FROZE** (F in 1st, Z in 4th)

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- **DROVE** tests high-frequency letters (D and V) and maximizes information gain:
  - If D is ✓ and V is ✓, the word is **DROVE**.
  - If D is x and V is ✓, the word must be **GROVE** (since V matches the 4th position).
  - If D is x and V is x, the word must be **FROZE**.
- This guess resolves all remaining possibilities efficiently, leveraging the feedback to pinpoint the word in one attempt.

We should try to use other common letters to uncover more information.\n\nWe know the word has R in the second position and E at the end. We need to find the first, third, and fourth letters.\n\nWe should avoid using C, A, N.\n\nCommon vowels we haven\'t tried: O, I, U (but we already tried A and E, and E is in). We also have E at the end, so the word might have another vowel? We don\'t know.\n\nCommon consonants: S, T, L, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWe can try a word that has:\n- First position: a new vowel or consonant (but not C, A, N)\n- Third position: a vowel? (since we have R and then a letter, then two more and then E)\n- Fourth position: a consonant?\n\nWe also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ E and that don\'t contain C, A, N.\n\nBut note: we are not required to guess a word that fits the pattern exactly because we are still in the process of gathering information. We can guess a word that doesn\'t fit the pattern to test other letters.\n\nHowever, if we can guess a word that fits the pattern and tests new letters, that would be ideal.\n\nBut we don\'t know the first, third, and fourth letters. So we can try a word that has R in the second position and E at the end, and uses new letters for the other positions.\n\nPossible words: \n- PRIDE: P, R, I, D, E -> but we don\'t know if P, I, D are in the word.\n- BRINE: but B is new, but we have N which is excluded (from previous feedback, N is not in the word) so we cannot use BRINE because it has N.\n- TRIPE: T, R, I, P, E -> T, I, P are new and we avoid C, A, N.\n\nBut let\'s check: TRIPE: T (first), R (second, correct), I (third), P (fourth), E (fifth, correct). This uses T, I, P which are new and not excluded.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that doesn\'t have E at the end to test other positions? But we know E is at the end, so if we put E in a different position, we might get a \'-\' if it\'s present elsewhere? But the feedback for E in the first guess was in the fifth position and correct, so E is only in the fifth position? Not necessarily, it could be elsewhere too? The feedback only tells us about the positions we guessed.\n\nIn the first guess, we had E at the fifth position and it was correct. But the word might have another E? However, we don\'t know. But the feedback for E was a check, meaning it is in the word and in that position. It doesn\'t say anything about other E\'s.\n\nBut in the feedback, we only get information about the letters we guessed. So if the word has two E\'s, we wouldn\'t know until we guess an E in another position.\n\nBut for now, we know at least one E is at the end.\n\nSo, for the second guess, we can try to use a word that has E in the fifth position and R in the second, and new letters elsewhere.\n\nLet me list some words that fit _ R _ _ E and don\'t have C, A, N:\n\n- GRIME: G, R, I, M, E\n- PRICE: but C is excluded, so no.\n- BRIDE: B, R, I, D, E\n- TRITE: T, R, I, T, E -> but T is repeated, might be less informative.\n- DRIVE: D, R, I, V, E\n- WRITE: W, R, I, T, E\n\nWe want to test as many new letters as possible. We have not tried: B, D, G, I, M, P, T, V, W, etc.\n\nI think ""WRITE"" is a good candidate: it uses W, R, I, T, E. We know R and E are in the word and in the correct positions. We are testing W, I, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""DRIVE"" tests D, I, V.\n\nBut note: we are not limited to words that have R and E in the correct positions? We can guess a word without R in the second or E in the fifth? But that might not be efficient because we know R must be in the second and E in the fifth. If we put R elsewhere, we might get a \'-\' if it\'s present, but we already know it\'s in the second. Similarly for E.\n\nBut if we put R in a different position, we might get a \'-\' for R in that position? But we know the word has R in the second, so if we put R in the first, it would be wrong and we might get a \'-\' if there is another R? But we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters.\n\nHowever, to maximize information, it might be better to avoid putting known letters in positions we know they are not? But we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, we can stick to the pattern and test new letters.\n\nI think ""WRITE"" is a good guess because:\n- It has W (new), R (correct), I (new), T (new), E (correct).\n- We can see if W, I, T are in the word and in which positions.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRIDE"" (P, R, I, D, E) is also good.\n\nBut let\'s choose one. I\'ll go with ""WRITE"".\n\nSo, second guess: WRITE\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use the pattern. We could also try a word that doesn\'t have R in the second or E in the fifth to test for other letters? But that might be less efficient because we are not using the known information.\n\nFor example, if we guess a word without R in the second, then we might get a \'-\' for R in a different position, which would tell us if there is another R? But we don\'t know if there is a duplicate.\n\nBut since we have limited guesses, it\'s better to focus on the known pattern and test new letters.\n\nI think ""WRITE"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nAlternatively, we could try a word that has a different set of letters to cover more common ones. For example, we haven\'t tried S, L, O, etc.\n\nBut in ""WRITE"", we are testing W, I, T. W is less common. Maybe we can choose a word with more common letters.\n\nHow about ""PRIDE"": P, R, I, D, E -> tests P, I, D.\n\nOr ""BRIDE"": B, R, I, D, E -> tests B, I, D.\n\nBut we don\'t know if B, I, D are in the word.\n\nAnother common word: ""TRICE"" but C is excluded.\n\n""ROUSE"": but R is in the first position? We need R in the second? Actually, in ""ROUSE"", R is first, but we know R is second in the target. So if we guess ""ROUSE"", we would have:\n- R in first: if the word has R only in the second, then R in first would be marked as not in the word? No, the feedback would be: R is in the word but in the wrong position (because the target has R in second, so R is present) so we would get a \'-\' for R? But we already know R is in the word. So it doesn\'t give new information about R. Similarly, we know E is in the fifth, but if we put E in the fourth? Then we might get a \'-\' for E if it is also elsewhere? But we don\'t know.\n\nSo to avoid confusion, it\'s better to keep R in the second and E in the fifth and test the other positions.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""PRIDE"".\n\nBut let me see: we have to avoid C, A, N. ""PRIDE"" has P, R, I, D, E. All new.\n\nSimilarly, ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.\n\nI think ""PRIDE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me think of the most common letters. After vowels, common consonants are T, S, L, R (we have R), D, etc.\n\nSo including T and D might be good.\n\n""TRIDE"" is not a word. ""BRIDE"" is a word: B, R, I, D, E.\n\nOr ""GRIDE"" is not common. ""PRIDE"" is common.\n\nBut ""PRIDE"" doesn\'t have T. How about ""TRIPE""? T, R, I, P, E.\n\n""TRIPE"" is a word (meaning a part of the stomach of an animal, or to rip off? but it\'s valid).\n\nBut ""TRIPE"" has T, R, I, P, E.\n\nAlternatively, ""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""PRIDE"" because it\'s a common word.\n\nBut let me check: we are testing P, I, D. We already know R and E are in place.\n\nSo, second guess: PRIDE\n\nBut note: we are not sure if the word has I or D or P. We are testing them.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a word that has S, because S is very common. But we cannot put S in the second or fifth? We can put S in the first, third, or fourth.\n\nFor example, ""RICES"" but C is excluded and S at the end? But we have E at the end, so we cannot have S at the end. The pattern is _ R _ _ E, so the fourth letter is before E. So we can have S in the first, third, or fourth.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that fits and has S? For example, ""RUSHE"" is not a word. ""ARISE"" but A is excluded. ""ERASE"" but E is at the beginning? And A is excluded? ""ERASE"" has A, which is excluded.\n\n""RISE"" is only 4 letters. ""PRISE"" is a word: P, R, I, S, E -> but that fits: _ R _ _ E -> PRISE: P (first), R (second), I (third), S (fourth), E (fifth). And it has S.\n\nBut we don\'t know if S is in the word. And we avoid A, C, N? PRISE: P, R, I, S, E. No A, C, N.\n\nSo ""PRISE"" is a valid guess and it tests P, I, S.\n\nS is more common than D? So maybe ""PRISE"" is better than ""PRIDE"".\n\nSimilarly, ""BRISE"" is not a word.\n\nSo I think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: PRISE is a word? It means to force open or a lever, but it\'s accepted in word games.\n\nAlternatively, ""RAISE"" but A is excluded.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PRISE"".\n\nBut we have to decide.\n\nAnother common word: ""TRICE"" is invalid because of C.\n\n""ROUTE"" but O is new, but R is in first? We need R in second.\n\nI think ""PRISE"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ""TRITE"" but it has T repeated? Not ideal.\n\nI think ""PRISE"" is a solid choice.\n\nSo, second guess: PRISE\n\nBut note: we are not required to use the pattern? But it\'s efficient.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that doesn\'t have R in the second to test for other letters? But that might waste the known information.\n\nI think sticking to the pattern is better.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PRISE"".\n\nBut let me think of the word list. Is ""PRISE"" common? It might be less common than ""PRIDE"", but it\'s valid.\n\nAnother option: ""BRINE"" but N is excluded, so no.\n\n""CRIME"" but C is excluded.\n\n""DRIVE"": D, R, I, V, E -> tests D, I, V.\n\nV is less common.\n\n""WRITE"": W, R, I, T, E -> tests W, I, T.\n\nW is less common.\n\nSo among the options, ""PRISE"" (with S) or ""PRIDE"" (with D) or ""TRIPE"" (with T and P).\n\nI think S is more common than D or T? Actually, T is more common than S? Let me recall: in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we have E and R, and we\'ve excluded A, N, C. So we haven\'t tried I, O, T, S, L.\n\nSo we should try to cover I, O, T, S, L.\n\nIn one guess, we can test multiple.\n\nIn ""PRISE"", we test P, I, S. We are missing O, T, L.\n\nIn ""TRIPE"", we test T, I, P. Missing O, S, L.\n\nIn ""TOILE"" but O and I, but T in first? And we need R in second? Not matching.\n\nWe can\'t cover all in one guess.\n\nBut we can try to cover as many as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""ROLES"" but R is first? We need R second. If we guess ""ROLES"", we get:\n- R: if the word has R only in second, then R in first would be marked as \'-\' (wrong position) and we already know R is in the word, so it doesn\'t help. Similarly, E is at the end? But we have E in fifth? In ""ROLES"", E is fourth? So we might get information about E? But we know E is in fifth, so if we put E in fourth, we might get a \'-\' if there is another E? But we don\'t know.\n\nBut to test more common letters, we could guess a word that has O, T, S, L, and avoid known bad letters.\n\nFor example, ""SLATE"" but A is excluded and we have E at the end? But in ""SLATE"", E is fifth, which is correct. But A is excluded, so we cannot use ""SLATE"".\n\n""SLOPE"": S, L, O, P, E -> E at the end is correct. But we don\'t have R in the second? So we are not using the known R position.\n\nBut we can test S, L, O, P. And we know E is at the end.\n\nBut we are not testing the first, third, and fourth positions of the pattern? We are testing a completely different word.\n\nThis might be acceptable because we can get information about S, L, O, P.\n\nBut we know the word has R in the second position, so if we don\'t include R in the guess, we won\'t get information about other positions of R? But we already know R is in the word and in the second position, so if we don\'t include R, we don\'t learn anything new about R. But we are testing other letters.\n\nHowever, we have only 6 guesses, so we need to balance.\n\nI think for the second guess, it\'s better to use the known information and test the unknown positions.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll stick with a word that has R in the second and E in the fifth.\n\nLet me choose ""PRISE"".\n\nSo, second guess: PRISE\n\nBut to be more confident, let me see if there\'s a word that includes T and O? But I can\'t think of one that fits _ R _ _ E without excluded letters.\n\n""TROPE"": T, R, O, P, E -> that fits! And O is a common vowel we haven\'t tried.\n\n""TROPE"" is a word (meaning a recurring theme). And it has T, R, O, P, E. We test T, O, P.\n\nO is a vowel we haven\'t tried, which is good.\n\nSo ""TROPE"" might be better than ""PRISE"" because we test O instead of S, and O is a vowel.\n\nSimilarly, we test T and P.\n\nSo I think ""TROPE"" is a good choice.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""TROPE"".\n\nSecond guess: TROPE\n\nIn summary, we are guessing ""TROPE"" to test T, O, P in the context of the pattern _ R _ _ E.\n\nSo, the guess is ""trope"".After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is not in the word (x).\n- R is in the correct position (second letter) (✓).\n- A is not in the word (x).\n- N is not in the word (x).\n- E is in the correct position (fifth letter) (✓).\n\nThis reveals:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ R _ _ E.\n- The letters C, A, and N are excluded.\n- The second letter is R, and the fifth letter is E.\n\nFor the second guess, I need to test new letters to uncover the first, third, and fourth positions. I should prioritize common vowels and consonants not yet tried (e.g., O, I, T, S, L, D) while avoiding C, A, and N. The word ""trope"" fits the pattern _ R _ _ E and includes:\n- T (new, tests first position),\n- R (known, second position),\n- O (new vowel, tests third position),\n- P (new, tests fourth position),\n- E (known, fifth position).\n\nThis guess efficiently tests three new letters (T, O, P) and maintains the known R and E positions, maximizing information gain.\n\n<guess>trope</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: trope -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, so R is the second letter)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the fifth letter)\n\nGuess 2: ""trope""\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)\n- O: ✓ (correct position, so O is the third letter)\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)\n\nFrom this, we know:\n- The word has the pattern: _ R O _ E\n- The second letter is R, third is O, fifth is E.\n- Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, P (from the x\'s)\n- We also know that O is in the third position and is correct.\n\nSo the word is of the form: _ R O _ E\n\nWe need to find the first and fourth letters.\n\nWe have excluded: C, A, N, T, P.\n\nWe have used: C, R, A, N, E, T, O, P.\n\nRemaining common letters: We should try to use common consonants and vowels that haven\'t been tried.

But we can check.\n\nBut let\'s focus on common words.\n\nWe also have ""IRONE"": but I is first? And N excluded? No.\n\n""GRACE"": C and A excluded.\n\nSo, possible candidates: GROVE, DROVE, BROKE, FROZE, and BROME.\n\nWe need to choose one that tests new letters.\n\nWe have to guess one of these, but we don\'t know which one. We can use a guess that includes letters that are common to narrow down.\n\nBut we have only one position unknown? Actually, two positions: first and fourth.\n\nWe know the pattern: first letter and fourth letter are missing.\n\nWe can try to guess a word that has letters that appear in many possibilities.\n\nFor example, among the candidates:\n- GROVE: G and V\n- DROVE: D and V\n- BROKE: B and K\n- FROZE: F and Z\n- BROME: B and M\n\nWe see that V appears in GROVE and DROVE, B appears in BROKE and BROME, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that can test multiple at once because the pattern is fixed.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that is not necessarily in the candidate set but tests common letters for the first and fourth positions.\n\nFor example, we can guess a word that has S or L or I in the first or fourth position? But we have to fit the pattern _ R O _ E.\n\nBut we cannot change the known positions.\n\nWe must have R in second, O in third, E in fifth.\n\nSo the only flexibility is the first and fourth.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has a common letter in the first position and another in the fourth.\n\nCommon letters for first position: we haven\'t tried S, B, D, G, etc.\n\nCommon letters for fourth position: similarly.\n\nBut we need to form a valid word.\n\nLet me list all possible words that fit _ R O _ E and don\'t use excluded letters (C, A, N, T, P).\n\nPossible first letters: any letter except C, A, N, T, P and also not used? But we can use any except excluded.\n\nExcluded: C, A, N, T, P.\n\nSo first letter can be: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut it must form a word with R O _ E.\n\nSimilarly, fourth letter: same set.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words:\n\n- B: BROME, BROKE (if valid)\n- D: DROVE\n- F: FROZE, FROME? (not common)\n- G: GROVE, GROPE (P excluded), GROLE? no\n- H: HROSE? no\n- I: IROKE? no\n- K: KROME? not common\n- L: LROSE? no, but ""LROE"" no. ""LROME""? no. Actually, is there a word like ""LRO_E""? I can\'t think of one.\n- M: MROME? no\n- Q: QROME? no\n- S: SROBE? no, ""SROKE""? no. ""SHROVE""? but H is in second? No, pattern is _ R O _ E, so ""SHROVE"" is S H R O V E? That\'s 6 letters. No, 5 letters: S, H, R, O, E? But then it would be S H R O E, which doesn\'t have O in third? Third is R? No: positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:R, 4:O, 5:E? But we need second to be R and third to be O. So ""SHROE"" is not a word and doesn\'t fit pattern.\n\nWe need the third letter to be O, so the word must be [letter1] R O [letter4] E.\n\nSo for S: is there a word ""SRO_E""? Like ""SROME""? Not a word. ""STROKE"" has T and is 6 letters? 5: S T R O K E? 6 letters. 5-letter: ""SROPE"" but P excluded and O is third? S R O P E? But P excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""SROLE""? Not a word.\n\nU: ""UROPE""? Not a word. Europe is 6.\n\nV: ""VROME""? no.\n\nW: ""WROSE""? no, ""WROKE"" has K and E? W R O K E? But that fits the pattern: W first, R second, O third, K fourth, E fifth. And ""wroke"" is not common, but ""wreak"" is different. ""WROKE"" might be archaic for ""wreaked"", but it\'s not commonly used. In Wordle, it might not be accepted.\n\nSimilarly, ""WROTE"" has T excluded.\n\nX, Y, Z: unlikely.\n\nSo the common ones are: GROVE, DROVE, BROKE, FROZE, BROME.\n\nBROME: is it valid? Brome is a type of grass, so yes.\n\nFROZE: not a word, but ""froze"" is the past of freeze, which is F R O Z E, so 5 letters: F, R, O, Z, E. That fits.\n\nSimilarly, BROKE: B, R, O, K, E.\n\nDROVE: D, R, O, V, E.\n\nGROVE: G, R, O, V, E.\n\nAlso, ""TRODE"" is not common and T excluded.\n\nAnother one: ""GROSS"" but not ending with E.\n\nSo, we have a few possibilities.\n\nWe need to guess one of them, but we can also use a guess that tests a letter that appears in multiple possibilities.\n\nFor example, V appears in GROVE and DROVE.\n\nB appears in BROKE and BROME.\n\nK appears in BROKE.\n\nZ appears in FROZE.\n\nM appears in BROME.\n\nG appears only in GROVE.\n\nD appears only in DROVE.\n\nF appears only in FROZE.\n\nSo if we guess a word that has, say, B, then if B is in the word, it must be in first position, and then we can narrow down.\n\nSimilarly for V, if V is in the word, it must be in fourth position.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that tests B and V together? Not in this pattern.\n\nWe have to guess one of the candidates.\n\nWe can also consider that we have not tried S, L, I, etc., but they don\'t form words in this pattern.\n\nSo, we must choose from the candidates.\n\nTo maximize information, we can choose a word that has a common letter. For example, B is more common than Z or V.\n\nBROKE has B and K.\n\nBut K is less common.\n\nDROVE has D and V.\n\nGROVE has G and V.\n\nFROZE has F and Z.\n\nBROME has B and M.\n\nAmong the first letters, B, D, G, F are all possible.\n\nWe can try ""BROKE"" as a guess.\n\nIf it\'s correct, great. If not, we get feedback on B and K.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""DROVE"", we test D and V.\n\nBut we have only 6 guesses, and this is the third guess.\n\nWe can afford to guess one of them.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we might get.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that is not in the candidate set but tests letters that are in multiple candidates? But we cannot, because the pattern is fixed.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""GIVEN"", but that doesn\'t have R in second or O in third, so it would be inefficient.\n\nWe must stick to the pattern.\n\nSo, I think we should guess one of the candidates.\n\nI\'ll choose ""BROKE"" because B is a common starting letter.\n\nSo, third guess: BROKE\n\nBut let\'s confirm: B is not excluded, R is correct, O is correct, K is new, E is correct.\n\nIf the word is ""BROKE"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on B and K.\n\nFor example, if B is not in the word, then we know the first letter is not B, so it must be D, G, F, etc.\n\nSimilarly for K.\n\nBut K is in the fourth position.\n\nSo, I think it\'s a reasonable guess.\n\nAnother option: ""DROVE"" is also common.\n\nBut I\'ll go with ""BROKE"".\n\nSo, <guess>broke</guess>\n\nBut let me see if there\'s a word that tests more common letters.\n\nWhat about ""SHIRE""? But that doesn\'t fit the pattern: we need third letter O.\n\nNo.\n\nI think ""BROKE"" is fine.Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - R is in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter).  \n    - E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).  \n    - C, A, and N are not in the word.  \n\n- **Guess 2: trope** → Feedback: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)  \n  - This reveals:  \n    - O is in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter).  \n    - R and E are confirmed in their positions (2nd and 5th).  \n    - T and P are not in the word.  \n\n### Current Knowledge:\n- The secret word has the pattern: **? R O ? E** (2nd letter: R, 3rd letter: O, 5th letter: E).  \n- Excluded letters: **C, A, N, T, P** (cannot appear in the word).  \n- Unknown positions: **1st and 4th letters**.  \n- Remaining possibilities for the 1st and 4th letters must be from the unused alphabet (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, S, V, W, etc.), and must form a valid English word.  \n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for the Next Guess:\n1. **Focus on the unknown positions**: We need to test potential letters for the 1st and 4th positions. Common letters not yet tested include B, D, S, L, M, and V.  \n2. **Prioritize high-frequency letters**: B, D, and S are very common in English, so testing them could quickly narrow down options.  \n3. **Generate valid word candidates**:  \n   - Possible words fitting **? R O ? E** and avoiding excluded letters (C, A, N, T, P) include:  \n     - **BROKE** (B in 1st, K in 4th)  \n     - **DROVE** (D in 1st, V in 4th)  \n     - **GROVE** (G in 1st, V in 4th)  \n     - **FROZE** (F in 1st, Z in 4th)  \n     - **BROME** (B in 1st, M in 4th)  \n   - Among these, **BROKE** and **DROVE** are common words and test high-frequency letters (B/D for 1st position, K/V for 4th position).  \n4. **Maximize information gain**:  \n   - Guessing **BROKE** tests B (common starting letter) and K. If B is correct, it confirms the 1st letter; if not, it eliminates B, pointing to alternatives like D or G. Similarly, K\'s feedback will help with the 4th position.  \n   - **BROKE** is chosen over **DROVE** because B is slightly more common than D as a starting letter, and it covers a different set of possibilities (e.g., if B is invalid, D and G become top candidates).  \n5. **Efficiency**: With only 6 guesses total, this guess could solve the puzzle if correct or provide critical constraints for the 4th guess.\n\n<guess>broke</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: trope -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: broke -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the third guess ""broke"":\n- B: x (not in the word)\n- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)\n- O: ✓ (correct position, third letter)\n- K: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)\n\nSo, combining all feedback:\n\nSecret word pattern: _ R O _ E\n\nExcluded letters: C, A, N, T, P, B, K  (from all x\'s)\n\nWe also have O in the third position confirmed.\n\nNow, we need to find the first and fourth letters. They must be letters not in the excluded set and form a valid English word.\n\nExcluded: C, A, N, T, P, B, K.\n\nSo, available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But we should focus on common letters.\n\nPossible words fitting _ R O _ E:\n\nWe had candidates earlier, but now B and K are excluded, so:\n\n- BROKE is out (B excluded)\n- DROVE: D, R, O, V, E -> D and V are not excluded\n- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E -> G and V not excluded\n- FROZE: F, R, O, Z, E -> F and Z not excluded\n- BROME: B excluded\n\nAlso, other possibilities:\n- SHROVE: not 5 letters? S H R O V E is 6 letters. Shrove is 6? Shrove is the past tense of shrive, but it\'s 6 letters? No, ""shrove"" is 6 letters? S-H-R-O-V-E? 6 characters. We need 5 letters: positions 1,2,3,4,5 must be: [1st], R, O, [4th], E.\n\nSo:\n- DROVE: D and V\n- GROVE: G and V\n- FROZE: F and Z\n- Also, ""WROVE""? W R O V E? Is that a word? Wrove is not commonly used, but it might be accepted as an archaic form of weave? But let\'s avoid rare words.\n- ""PROVE"": P excluded\n- ""TROVE"": T excluded\n- ""GROVE"" and ""DROVE"" are common.\n- Another one: ""GROPE"" but P excluded.\n\nAlso, ""TRODE"": T excluded and not common.\n\nSo, main candidates: DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.\n\nNow, we have to guess one of these? Or we can try to test multiple letters.\n\nBut we don\'t have a word that tests for both D and G, for example.\n\nWe could guess ""DROVE"" to test D and V.\n\nSimilarly, ""GROVE"" tests G and V.\n\nIf we guess ""DROVE"" and it\'s wrong, we get feedback on D and V.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nTo maximize information, we might guess a word that uses a common letter for the fourth position.\n\nNote that V appears in both DROVE and GROVE. So if we test V and it\'s in the word, then the fourth letter is V, and the first letter must be D or G.\n\nBut we don\'t have a way to test V without using one of the candidate words.\n\nSince we have only a few possibilities, we could guess one directly.\n\nWe have used 3 guesses and have 3 left? Or 3 made, so 3 more? Total 6, so guesses left: 3.\n\nWe can afford to guess.\n\nBut we might be able to solve in this guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that tests letters like S or L in the first position, but no such word exists in this pattern? For example, ""SROLE"" not a word.\n\nSo, we must choose from DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.\n\nOf these, DROVE and GROVE are very common, while FROZE is less common (froze is common, but FROZE would be F-R-O-Z-E, which is ""froze"", past of freeze, so it\'s valid).\n\nTo decide, we note that we haven\'t tested D, G, F, V, Z.\n\nV is more common than Z, and D and G are both common.\n\nBut F is less common than D or G.\n\nSo, perhaps prioritize DROVE or GROVE over FROZE.\n\nLet\'s look at common letters.\n\nIf we guess ""DROVE"":\n- If D is in the first position and V in the fourth, it\'s correct.\n- If D is not in the word, then D is x, and V might be - or x.\n\nSimilarly for GROVE.\n\nBut since V appears in both, if V is correct, then we know the fourth letter is V, and then we only need to test D vs G for first letter.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""DROVE"" and get:\n- D: ✓? Then it must be DROVE.\n- D: x? Then D is not first, so not DROVE. And if V is ✓ or -?\n\nBut positions: in DROVE, D is first, V is fourth.\n\nIf D is x, then the first letter is not D. Then if V is ✓, then fourth letter is V, so the word must be GROVE (since FROZE has Z, not V).\n\nSimilarly, if V is x, then it must be FROZE or other? But FROZE has Z, not V.\n\nSo:\n\nIf we guess ""DROVE"":\n- Feedback possibilities:\n  - If D(✓) and V(✓): word is DROVE.\n  - If D(x) and V(✓): then D not first, V in fourth? Then first letter must be something else, but V in fourth implies the word must be GROVE (since FROZE has Z). So we know it\'s GROVE.\n  - If D(✓) and V(x): impossible? Because if D is in first and correct, then the word is D R O ? E, and V not in word? But no candidate has D and not V? Only DROVE has D, so if D is correct but V not in word, then contradiction? Meaning DROVE is not the word, but D is first? Oh, wait.\n\nActually, if the word is GROVE, and we guess DROVE:\n- First position: D vs G -> D not in word? So D: x (since G is there, and D not in word)\n- Fourth position: V vs V -> if GROVE has V in fourth? Wait, GROVE is G R O V E, so fourth is V. So V is in the word and in the correct position? In ""DROVE"", we put V in fourth, so if the word is GROVE, V is still in fourth? Yes, so V should be ✓.\n\nBut D is not in the word? So D: x.\n\nSimilarly, if word is FROZE:\n- Guess DROVE: D is not in word (x), R correct, O correct, V should be: not in word? Because FROZE has Z in fourth. So V: x, E correct.\n\nSimilarly, if word is GROVE and we guess DROVE: D: x (not in word), R: ✓, O: ✓, V: ✓ (correct position? In GROVE V is fourth? Yes, so V: ✓), E: ✓.\n\nNow, feedback:\n- For GROVE: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓)? But V is in the correct position? Yes.\n\nBut we don\'t know which letter is the fourth? The feedback would mark each position.\n\nFor DROVE guessed against GROVE:\n- D in first: not the word? Since GROVE has G, so D: x (wrong)\n- R: ✓\n- O: ✓\n- V in fourth: GROVE has V in fourth? Yes, so V: ✓\n- E: ✓\n\nBut we also might get warnings about repeated letters? But no duplicates here.\n\nSimilarly, for FROZE vs DROVE:\n- D: x\n- R: ✓\n- O: ✓\n- V: x (FROZE has no V)\n- E: ✓\n\nSo:\n\nCase 1: word is DROVE → feedback: D(✓), R(✓), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓)\n\nCase 2: word is GROVE → feedback: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓)  — here D(x) and V(✓) tell us it\'s GROVE? Almost.\n\nCase 3: word is FROZE → feedback: D(x), R(✓), O(✓), V(x), E(✓)\n\nSo if after guessing DROVE, if we get all ✓ except D x? But we have R, O, E already ✓, so it must be V and E ✓? But in case of GROVE, V is ✓; in FROZE, V is x.\n\nSo:\n\n- If we get D(✓) and V(✓), it\'s DROVE.\n- If we get D(x) and V(✓), then it must be GROVE (since FROZE would not have V).\n- If we get D(x) and V(x), then it must be FROZE.\n\nThus, by guessing DROVE, we can solve all cases with the feedback.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess GROVE, we can infer similarly.\n\nFor GROVE guessed against DROVE: similar outcomes.\n\nBut since we are at the third guess, and this is the fourth, we can choose either.\n\nI\'ll choose DROVE because it starts with a common letter.\n\nSo, fourth guess: DROVE\n\nIf not, we\'ll know immediately.\n\nBut let\'s see: we have three possibilities left: DROVE, GROVE, FROZE.\n\nGuessing DROVE will tell us:\n\n- If response has D(✓) and V(✓) → word is DROVE.\n- If D(x) and V(✓) → word is GROVE.\n- If D(x) and V(x) → word is FROZE.\n\nSo it\'s perfect.\n\nWe should guess DROVE.After analyzing the cumulative feedback:\n\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: ✓ for R (2nd position) and E (5th position); x for C, A, N.\n- **Guess 2: trope** → Feedback: ✓ for R (2nd position), O (3rd position), and E (5th position); x for T, P.\n- **Guess 3: broke** → Feedback: ✓ for R (2nd position), O (3rd position), and E (5th position); x for B, K.\n\n### Key Insights:\n1. **Pattern confirmed**: The secret word is **?

We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""drove"":
- D: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)
- O: ✓ (correct position, third letter)
- V: ✓ (correct position, so V is the fourth letter)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

From this, we know:
- The fourth letter is V, because V is marked correct in the fourth position.
- D is not in the word.

Therefore, the word is: _ R O V E

And we know the first letter is not D, and also not any of the previously excluded letters: C, A, N, T, P, B, K.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, P, B, K, D.

Now, we have the pattern: ? R O V E

We need to find the first letter. It must be a letter not excluded and form a valid English word.

Possible first letters: from the remaining letters: F, G, H, I, J, L, M, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.

But we have a candidate from earlier: GROVE and FROZE. But FROZE has Z in fourth? No, in FROZE it's F R O Z E, so fourth is Z, not V. But we have V in fourth, so FROZE is eliminated.

Similarly, we had GROVE: G R O V E, which fits.

Are there other words?

For example:
- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E
- Also, ""PROVE"" but P excluded.
- ""TROVE"" T excluded.
- ""WROVE"" is not common, but let's check: W R O V E? ""Wrove"" is an archaic word, but might be accepted? However, we have to see.

But GROVE is the most common.

Is there any other word? ""DROVE"" we guessed and D is excluded, so not that.

What about ""SHOVE""? But that would be S H O V E, so second letter is H, not R. But we need second letter R, so no.

Similarly, ""GLOVE"" is G L O V E, so second letter L, not R.

So, the only common word that fits ? R O V E is GROVE.

But let me confirm: first letter must be such that the word is valid.

- GROVE: yes, a small wood.

- Also, ""PROVE"" excluded.

- ""TROVE"" excluded.

- ""AROVE"" not a word.

- ""CROVE"" C excluded.

- ""BROVE"" B excluded.

- ""FROVE"" not a word.

- ""MROVE"" not a word.

- ""SROVE"" not a word.

- ""WROVE"": as above, might be accepted in some dictionaries as the past tense of weave in some contexts, but it's rare.

In standard Wordle, GROVE is the most likely.

Given that V is in the fourth position, and we have R O V E, the only common word is GROVE.

Therefore, the word must be GROVE.

So, we should guess GROVE.

But let's see the feedback from the fourth guess: we have V(✓), so fourth letter is V, and the word ends with O V E? No, the word is ? R O V E.

So, for GROVE: G R O V E.

We haven't tested G, but it's not excluded.

So, fifth guess: GROVE

If it's correct, we win.

If not, then we have to consider rare words like WROVE, but that's unlikely.

But given the feedback, it must be GROVE.

So, I'll go with that.

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(✓)  
  - Revealed: R (2nd position), E (5th position); excluded C, A, N.
- **Guess 2: trope** → Feedback: T(x) R(✓) O(✓) P(x) E(✓)  
  - Revealed: O (3rd position); excluded T, P.
- **Guess 3: broke** → Feedback: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)  
  - Excluded B, K.
- **Guess 4: drove** → Feedback: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓)  
  - Revealed: V (4th position); excluded D.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is **? R O V E** (2nd: R, 3rd: O, 4th: V, 5th: E). Only the 1st letter is unknown.
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, T, P, B, K, D (cannot be in the word).
- **Possible 1st letters**: Must be a valid English letter not excluded (e.g., F, G, L, M, S, W, etc.), forming a real 5-letter word.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Analyze the pattern**: The word must end in ""ROVE"" (positions 2–5 confirmed). The only common English word fitting this pattern is **GROVE** (G in 1st position).
2. **Check exclusions**: G is not excluded (not in C, A, N, T, P, B, K, D), so ""GROVE"" is valid.
3. **Eliminate alternatives**: 
   - Other words like ""PROVE"" (P excluded), ""TROVE"" (T excluded), or ""WROVE"" (rare/archaic) are invalid or unlikely.
   - No other common words match the pattern with the remaining letters (e.g., ""FROVE"" isn't a word; ""SHOVE"" has H in 2nd position, not R).
4. **Conclusion**: ""GROVE"" is the only feasible solution given the constraints and feedback. Guessing it resolves the game.

<guess>grove</guess>",grove,"We have the feedback from the fourth guess ""drove"":
- D: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct position, second letter)
- O: ✓ (correct position, third letter)
- V: ✓ (correct position, so V is the fourth letter)
- E: ✓ (correct position, fifth letter)

From this, we know:
- The fourth letter is V, because V is marked correct in the fourth position.
- D is not in the word.

Therefore, the word is: _ R O V E

And we know the first letter is not D, and also not any of the previously excluded letters: C, A, N, T, P, B, K.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, T, P, B, K, D.

Now, we have the pattern: ? R O V E

We need to find the first letter. It must be a letter not excluded and form a valid English word.

Possible first letters: from the remaining letters: F, G, H, I, J, L, M, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.

But we have a candidate from earlier: GROVE and FROZE. But FROZE has Z in fourth? No, in FROZE it's F R O Z E, so fourth is Z, not V. But we have V in fourth, so FROZE is eliminated.

Similarly, we had GROVE: G R O V E, which fits.

Are there other words?

For example:
- GROVE: G, R, O, V, E
- Also, ""PROVE"" but P excluded.
- ""TROVE"" T excluded.
- ""WROVE"" is not common, but let's check: W R O V E? ""Wrove"" is an archaic word, but might be accepted? However, we have to see.

But GROVE is the most common.

Is there any other word? ""DROVE"" we guessed and D is excluded, so not that.

What about ""SHOVE""? But that would be S H O V E, so second letter is H, not R. But we need second letter R, so no.

Similarly, ""GLOVE"" is G L O V E, so second letter L, not R.

So, the only common word that fits ? R O V E is GROVE.

But let me confirm: first letter must be such that the word is valid.

- GROVE: yes, a small wood.

- Also, ""PROVE"" excluded.

- ""TROVE"" excluded.

- ""AROVE"" not a word.

- ""CROVE"" C excluded.

- ""BROVE"" B excluded.

- ""FROVE"" not a word.

- ""MROVE"" not a word.

- ""SROVE"" not a word.

- ""WROVE"": as above, might be accepted in some dictionaries as the past tense of weave in some contexts, but it's rare.

In standard Wordle, GROVE is the most likely.

Given that V is in the fourth position, and we have R O V E, the only common word is GROVE.

Therefore, the word must be GROVE.

So, we should guess GROVE.

But let's see the feedback from the fourth guess: we have V(✓), so fourth letter is V, and the word ends with O V E? No, the word is ? R O V E.

So, for GROVE: G R O V E.

We haven't tested G, but it's not excluded.

So, fifth guess: GROVE

If it's correct, we win.

If not, then we have to consider rare words like WROVE, but that's unlikely.

But given the feedback, it must be GROVE.

So, I'll go with that.Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Guess 3: broke** → Feedback: B(x) R(✓) O(✓) K(x) E(✓)  
  - Excluded B, K.
- **Guess 4: drove** → Feedback: D(x) R(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓)  
  - Revealed: V (4th position); excluded D.

### Current Knowledge:
- **Pattern**: The secret word is **? R O V E** (2nd: R, 3rd: O, 4th: V, 5th: E). Only the 1st letter is unknown.
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, T, P, B, K, D (cannot be in the word).
- **Possible 1st letters**: Must be a valid English letter not excluded (e.g., F, G, L, M, S, W, etc.), forming a real 5-letter word.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Analyze the pattern**: The word must end in ""ROVE"" (positions 2–5 confirmed). The only common English word fitting this pattern is **GROVE** (G in 1st position).
2. **Check exclusions**: G is not excluded (not in C, A, N, T, P, B, K, D), so ""GROVE"" is valid.
3. **Eliminate alternatives**: 
   - Other words like ""PROVE"" (P excluded), ""TROVE"" (T excluded), or ""WROVE"" (rare/archaic) are invalid or unlikely.
   - No other common words match the pattern with the remaining letters (e.g., ""FROVE"" isn't a word; ""SHOVE"" has H in 2nd position, not R).
4. **Conclusion**: ""GROVE"" is the only feasible solution given the constraints and feedback. Guessing it resolves the game.",Guess 5: grove -> FEEDBACK: G(✓) R(✓) O(✓) V(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
