We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common consonants and a vowel, and all letters are distinct.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)

Important: R is correct and in the right position? The feedback shows R(✓), which means R is in the word and in the correct position.

But note: in the secret word, R is the second letter (position 2) because in ""crane"", R is the second letter and it got a ✓.

So the secret word has R as the second letter.

Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E (since they got x). And R is confirmed in position 2.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We need to make a second guess. We should avoid using C, A, N, E because they are not in the word (unless we have reason to think otherwise, but feedback says they are not present).

Also, we should include other common letters to test.

List of available letters: Not C, A, N, E. And we know R is fixed in position 2.

Common vowels that might appear: O, I, U (but A and E are out, so possibly O or I).

Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C and R which we know about).

Since R is in position 2, we cannot put R again? We don't know yet if R can repeat, but typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? But let's assume it might not. Since we haven't seen feedback indicating repetition, we can avoid for now.

But note: the feedback doesn't show multiple of same letter? Actually, the game handles duplicates: if there are multiple identical letters in the guess, they are treated separately, but the secret word might have fewer.

However, in our case, ""crane"" only has one R, so we don't have information on duplicate R.

It's safer to avoid repeating R until we know it might occur.

Potential words: we need a word that has R as the second letter.

Also, since we have four spots to fill: first, third, fourth, fifth.

Common words with R in second position: like TRY, but that's 3 letters. 5-letter words: BRICK, BRISK, BRINE, etc. But BRINE has E and N which we know are not in the word? Wait, E and N are not in the word, according to feedback.

In the first guess, E was at the end and got x, so E is not present. Similarly, N is not present.

Also, C and A are not present.

So we cannot use the letters C, A, N, E.

Therefore, BRINE has N and E, so not allowed. Similarly, BRICK has C and K? C is not present, so BRICK has C? Actually, BRICK: B R I C K -> C is the fourth letter, which we know is not in the word (since first guess showed C not present).

So BRICK is not possible because it contains C.

Better to choose a word without these forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E

Therefore, the new word must not contain C, A, N, E and must have R as the second letter.

What are possible words?

I can think of words like: PROUD, GROUP - but GROUP doesn't have R as second letter? GROUP is G-R-O-U-P -> R is second? G(1), R(2), so yes.

GROUP: has G, R, O, U, P.

But does it have any forbidden letters? C, A, N, E not in GROUP? A and E are vowels, but GROUP uses O and U. So GROUP is okay? It doesn't have C,A,N,E.

However, we need to maximize information. We haven't tested many letters.

Other possibilities: WORDY, but W is less common.

We want to test more common letters.

Common letters: we might test T, S, L, O, I, etc.

So a word with R second, without C,A,N,E, and including other common letters.

Possible words: 
- BROIL: B R O I L -> letters: B,R,O,I,L
- GRIMY: G R I M Y
- PROWL: P R O W L

But BROIL has O and I, which are untested.

Another idea: we know R is fixed, so we can focus on other positions.

Perhaps ""TRYST"" but Y is less common.

Or ""PRISM"": P R I S M

PRISM: P, R, I, S, M. No C,A,N,E.

But S and M are common.

Similarly, we could do ""TRIPS"": T R I P S.

""TRIPS"": T R I P S -> no forbidden letters.

""TRIPS"" and ""PRISM"" are good.

Alternatively, ""PERCH"" but E is forbidden? PERCH has E -> not allowed.

So avoid E.

Another word: ""BROWN"" -> B R O W N -> but N is forbidden? N was in the first guess and not present. So BROWN has N -> invalid.

Therefore, avoid N.

Similarly, ""CRUST"" has C -> invalid.

""TRUST"" has no C,A,N,E? T, R, U, S, T -> R is second, but U and S. Also, it has two T's? We don't know about T yet.

But we can use T.

What about ""TRYST"" -> T R Y S T -> has two T's? But secret word might have T or not? We don't know.

But we can try.

However, perhaps a word without duplicates first.

I think ""PRISM"" or ""TRIPS"" are good.

""PRISM"": P R I S M
""TRIPS"": T R I P S

Both cover common letters.

Let's compare:
PRISM: letters P, R, I, S, M
TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S → essentially P,R,I,S,T and M in PRISM vs T,P,R,I,S.

But TRIPS has P,R,I,S,T which are all common.

Moreover, in TRIPS, we have S and T which we haven't tested.

But note: in TRIPS, the P is first letter? But R is fixed second. So in TRIPS, R is second? T is first, R second, I third, P fourth, S fifth? Yes.

Similarly, in PRISM, P first, R second, I third, S fourth, M fifth.

Both seem fine.

But we have to consider the positions. We want to test letters in different positions to get more feedback.

In particular, we need to test the first position, since it's not fixed.

In the secret word, first letter is one of the unknowns.

So TRIPS has T in first, and PRISM has P in first.

Commonality: T is more common as starter than P? But both are fine.

S is also common.

Another word: ""ROAST"" but R is first in ROAST, but in our case, R is fixed second, so not applicable.

What about ""DRIFT""? But D,R,I,F,T → F is less common, and D?

""DRIFT"" has D,R,I,F,T. Forbidden letters? No C,A,N,E.

But we might want to include vowels? So far we have R, and in PRISM or TRIPS, they have I as vowel.

O is another vowel, but we might not have it yet.

What about ""BROTH""? But O and T,H? Also, BROTH: B R O T H → H is common? But BROTH has O, which is vowel.

But earlier BROIL was also an option without forbidden letters.

Let me list some words that fit:
- BROOK: B R O O K → has two O's? But O is not tested. Invalid if O repeats and secret doesn't have two? But it's okay to guess duplicates.
- PROWS: P R O W S → but W is less common.
- GRIPT: not common.

Perhaps better to go with PRISM or TRIPS.

I'll choose TRIPS because it has T and S, and T is a very common starting letter.

So second guess: TRIPS

That is, T-R-I-P-S.

Then we can get feedback on T, R, I, P, S.

But note: R is already correct and in position, so for R, we expect ✓ again? Unless the word has multiple R? But feedback might show.

Since R is correct in second position, it should be ✓.

Now, if T is in the word or not, I in the word or third position, etc.

After this, we'll have more clues.

So let's go with ""trips"".

But confirm: trips is a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, second guess: trips.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is correct and in position 2 (✓), meaning the secret word has R as the second letter.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the word (x), so these letters should be avoided in the next guess.
- The secret word now has the pattern: `_ R _ _ _`.

For the second guess:
- Choose a word that includes R in position 2 to maintain its correct placement and test new letters.
- Avoid using C, A, N, or E.
- Prioritize common vowels (like I or O) and consonants (like T, S, P, L) to maximize feedback.
- Good candidates: ""TRIPS"" or ""PRISM"". Both have R in position 2 and avoid forbidden letters. ""TRIPS"" is selected to test T, I, P, and S—common letters not yet evaluated.

So avoid E.

Another word: ""BROWN"" -> B R O W N -> but N is forbidden? N was in the first guess and not present. So BROWN has N -> invalid.

Similarly, ""CRUST"" has C -> invalid.

""TRUST"" has no C,A,N,E? T, R, U, S, T -> R is second, but U and S. Also, it has two T's? We don't know about T yet.

But we can use T.

But does it have any forbidden letters? C, A, N, E not in GROUP? A and E are vowels, but GROUP uses O and U. So GROUP is okay? It doesn't have C,A,N,E.

However, we need to maximize information. We haven't tested many letters.

Other possibilities: WORDY, but W is less common.

We want to test more common letters.

Common letters: we might test T, S, L, O, I, etc.

So a word with R second, without C,A,N,E, and including other common letters.

Possible words: 
- BROIL: B R O I L -> letters: B,R,O,I,L
- GRIMY: G R I M Y
- PROWL: P R O W L

But BROIL has O and I, which are untested.

Another idea: we know R is fixed, so we can focus on other positions.

Perhaps ""TRYST"" but Y is less common.

Or ""PRISM"": P R I S M

PRISM: P, R, I, S, M. No C,A,N,E.

But S and M are common.

Similarly, we could do ""TRIPS"": T R I P S.

""TRIPS"": T R I P S -> no forbidden letters.

""TRIPS"" and ""PRISM"" are good.

Alternatively, ""PERCH"" but E is forbidden? PERCH has E -> not allowed.

So avoid E.

Another word: ""BROWN"" -> B R O W N -> but N is forbidden? N was in the first guess and not present. So BROWN has N -> invalid.

Therefore, avoid N.

Similarly, ""CRUST"" has C -> invalid.

""TRUST"" has no C,A,N,E? T, R, U, S, T -> R is second, but U and S. Also, it has two T's? We don't know about T yet.

But we can use T.

What about ""TRYST"" -> T R Y S T -> has two T's? But secret word might have T or not? We don't know.

But we can try.

However, perhaps a word without duplicates first.

I think ""PRISM"" or ""TRIPS"" are good.

""PRISM"": P R I S M
""TRIPS"": T R I P S

Both cover common letters.

Let's compare:
PRISM: letters P, R, I, S, M
TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S → essentially P,R,I,S,T and M in PRISM vs T,P,R,I,S.

But TRIPS has P,R,I,S,T which are all common.

Moreover, in TRIPS, we have S and T which we haven't tested.

But note: in TRIPS, the P is first letter? But R is fixed second. So in TRIPS, R is second? T is first, R second, I third, P fourth, S fifth? Yes.

Similarly, in PRISM, P first, R second, I third, S fourth, M fifth.

Both seem fine.

But we have to consider the positions. We want to test letters in different positions to get more feedback.

In particular, we need to test the first position, since it's not fixed.

In the secret word, first letter is one of the unknowns.

So TRIPS has T in first, and PRISM has P in first.

Commonality: T is more common as starter than P? But both are fine.

S is also common.

Another word: ""ROAST"" but R is first in ROAST, but in our case, R is fixed second, so not applicable.

What about ""DRIFT""? But D,R,I,F,T → F is less common, and D?

""DRIFT"" has D,R,I,F,T. Forbidden letters? No C,A,N,E.

But we might want to include vowels? So far we have R, and in PRISM or TRIPS, they have I as vowel.

O is another vowel, but we might not have it yet.

What about ""BROTH""? But O and T,H? Also, BROTH: B R O T H → H is common? But BROTH has O, which is vowel.

But earlier BROIL was also an option without forbidden letters.

Let me list some words that fit:
- BROOK: B R O O K → has two O's? But O is not tested. Invalid if O repeats and secret doesn't have two? But it's okay to guess duplicates.
- PROWS: P R O W S → but W is less common.
- GRIPT: not common.

Perhaps better to go with PRISM or TRIPS.

I'll choose TRIPS because it has T and S, and T is a very common starting letter.

So second guess: TRIPS

That is, T-R-I-P-S.

Then we can get feedback on T, R, I, P, S.

But note: R is already correct and in position, so for R, we expect ✓ again? Unless the word has multiple R? But feedback might show.

Since R is correct in second position, it should be ✓.

Now, if T is in the word or not, I in the word or third position, etc.

After this, we'll have more clues.

So let's go with ""trips"".

But confirm: trips is a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, second guess: trips.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is correct and in position 2 (✓), meaning the secret word has R as the second letter.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the word (x), so these letters should be avoided in the next guess.
- The secret word now has the pattern: `_ R _ _ _`.

For the second guess:
- Choose a word that includes R in position 2 to maintain its correct placement and test new letters.
- Avoid using C, A, N, or E.
- Prioritize common vowels (like I or O) and consonants (like T, S, P, L) to maximize feedback.
- Good candidates: ""TRIPS"" or ""PRISM"". Both have R in position 2 and avoid forbidden letters. ""TRIPS"" is selected to test T, I, P, and S—common letters not yet evaluated.

We have two sets of feedback.

First guess: ""crane""
- C(x) : C is not in the secret word.
- R(✓): R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A(x): A is not in the secret word.
- N(x): N is not in the secret word.
- E(x): E is not in the secret word.

Second guess: ""trips""
- T(x): T is not in the secret word.
- R(✓): R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2). This matches the first feedback.
- I(✓): I is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3).
- P(x): P is not in the secret word.
- S(-): S is in the secret word but in the wrong position.

From this feedback, we can deduce:
- The secret word has R as the second letter and I as the third letter. So the pattern so far is: _ R I _ _
- S is in the secret word but not in the fourth or fifth position (since in ""trips"", S was at the end, position 5, and it was marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position). So S is somewhere in the word but not at position 5. Since the only other positions available are 1 and 4 (as positions 2 and 3 are taken by R and I), S must be in either position 1 or 4? But wait, in position 4? That's possible. Or position 1? We don't know yet.

Actually, the positions: 
- Position 1: unknown
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: unknown
- Position 5: unknown

And S is in the word but not at position 5 (since it received ""-"", meaning present but wrong position; and at position 5 in the guess, so it can't be at position 5). Therefore, S must be at position 1 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth position.

Wait: the feedback for S is ""-"" and it was guessed at position 5. This means the secret word has S, but not at position 5. Therefore, it could be at position 1 or position 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are occupied by R and I). However, we cannot rule out position 4? Actually, all positions except 2 and 3 are possible, but position 5 is ruled out for S.

So S is at position 1 or position 4.

Additionally, we know that T and P are not in the word (from the ""trips"" feedback: T(x) and P(x)). Also, from first guess, C, A, N, E are out.

So forbidden letters now: C, A, N, E, T, P.

We must use only letters not in this forbidden set.

The secret word pattern: _ R I _ _

Letters known to be in the word: R, I, S? Yes, because S is marked as ""-"".

So S is in the word. And we need to find two more letters? Actually, we have three letters: R, I, S; but the word has five positions, so two more letters.

Moreover, we have position 1 and positions 4-5 that need to be filled, with S possibly at position 1 or 4? But if S is not at position 1, then position 1 is something else and S is at position 4? Also, position 5 is another letter? Let me clarify:

The secret word has 5 positions:
1: ? (could be S or another letter, but we know S must be either at 1 or 4 because if S were at 4, that's one option, or at 1. But if S is at position 4, then position 1 is not S? Similarly, if S is at 1, then position 4 is not S? But S cannot be at position 5, as we know.)

Actually, S could also be at position 4? But we haven't tested position 4? No, in our guesses, we haven't tested S at position 4 yet? In ""trips"", S was at position 5.

So possibilities:
Case 1: S is at position 1 in the secret word.
Case 2: S is at position 4 in the secret word.

But if S were at position 4, then in the pattern _ R I _ _, that would leave position 1 and 5.

However, from the feedback, we also know that S is not at position 5? But position 4 is different? Sorry, I think I confused.

In the secret word, positions:
1: ? 
2: R (fixed)
3: I (fixed)
4: ?
5: ?

S is in the word but not at position 5? Since we guessed S at position 5 and it got ""-"", meaning wrong position. Therefore, S cannot be at position 5. So S must be at one of the positions: 1 or 4 (because positions 2 and 3 are occupied and have different letters).

Therefore, we need to test both possibilities.

Moreover, for the remaining letters, we need to choose a word that fits and gives more information.

Also, we need to avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T, P.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S? Yes, but we are using S? But we are also trying to place S? Actually, S must be included? Or not? Since we know S is in the word, so we should use S in the next guess to find its position.

For the third guess, we should try to determine the position of S and also test other possible letters.

Now, the secret word pattern: positions 1, 4, 5 need letters? With the constraint that S must be one of them but not at position 5? Actually, S must be at position 1 or 4.

Idea: we can guess a word that has S at position 1? For example, ""S _ _ _ _"" and with R and I at positions 2 and 3? Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, we have to guess a word that has the format: ? R I ? ? , but with S either at 1 or 4.

Actually, the word must have R at 2, I at 3. So the structure: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]

S must be either at letter1 or letter4? But if S is at letter1, then letter4 is something else. If S is at letter4, then letter1 is something else.

And letter5 is always not S? Because S cannot be at 5? Correct.

Also, we know S is present, so it must be at 1 or 4.

So possible words: we need to choose letter1, letter4, letter5 from the available letters (excluding C,A,N,E,T,P), with the constraint that one of letter1 or letter4 is S? But we can't assume that? It could be either? So we need to explore.

To maximize information, we should consider guessing a word that can distinguish between these cases.

For example, if we guess a word that has S at position 1, then:
- If the feedback shows ✓ for S at position 1, then we know S is at position 1.
- If it shows ""-"" for S at position 1? Then S must be at position 4? Because if S were at position 1, it should be ✓, and if it were at position 4, then at guess position 1 it might be marked x if not present? Wait no, S is in the word, so if we put S at position 1 and S is actually at position 4, then it should get ""-"" (wrong position).

Similarly, if we put S at position 4, then:
- If S is at position 4, we get ✓.
- If S is at position 1, we get ""-"".

So by playing S at position 1, we can get feedback to pinpoint.

Moreover, we should include other new letters to test for the other positions.

Available letters: let's list the ones we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And S.

But S is mandatory in the word? We are including it? Yes.

Now, what about position 5? Test a common vowel or consonant.

It's also important to note that we must find a valid English word.

Possible words:

Option: if we put S at position 1: then the word must be S R I ? ?

And we need to fill ? and ? with letters not in forbidden list.

Possible endings: 
Examples: SRIS? Not a word. SRID? Not common. SRIM? Not common.

SRIL? Not a word.

S R I with K or L? SRIL is not English.

Common words: ""SHRIM"" - does that exist? Not really. Shrimp is 6 letters.

Another: ""SHRUG"" - that's S H R U G -> but position 3 is U? But we need R at position 2? Wait, ""shrug"": S(1) H(2) R(3) U(4) G(5) -> which doesn't match our pattern (we need R at position 2 and I at position 3).

So we need the pattern: S R I ? ?

What about ""SERIF""? But E is forbidden? Because A? E also forbidden? From first guess E(x).

""serif"" has E -> not allowed.

""SCRIM"" has C -> forbidden.

""STRIP"" has T -> forbidden.

So hard.

Perhaps put S at position 4: then pattern: ? R I S ?

Again, ? R I S ? 

Examples: CRISP? But C forbidden. TRISM? Not a word.

""FRISK"": F R I S K -> F is not forbidden? Forbidden are C,A,N,E,T,P. So F is allowed? F-R-I-S-K: F(1) R(2) I(3) S(4) K(5) -> valid pattern.

FRISK is a word? Yes, meaning to frisk search or lively?

Also, BRISK: B R I S K -> also a word, meaning quick.

Both are valid.

Letters: FRISK has F,R,I,S,K -> all acceptable? F not forbidden, K not forbidden.

Similarly, BRISK: B,R,I,S,K.

We could also think of ""PRISM"" but P forbidden? From second guess P(x), so P is out.

Similarly, ""GRISLY"" too long.

So FRISK and BRISK are candidates.

But we also need to test the position of S? Because in our guess, if we play ""FRISK"", then:

Position 4: S. So if secret word has S at position 4, it would get ✓. If secret word has S at position 1, then in position 4 we have S, which might be x or -? Since S is in the word, but at wrong position? But position 1 would be F, which might be present or not.

Similarly, with BRISK.

But note: we are trying to find the position of S? If we play FRISK:

- If F is not in the word? Then position 1 F might be x? but S would be at position 4? Then for S: if secret S is at position 4, then in guess position 4 S would be ✓? If secret S is at position 1, then in guess position 4 S would be - because wrong position? And F at position 1 would be x if not present? But S at position 4 in this scenario, when secret has S at 1, would be marked as - because S is present but not at position 4.

Similarly, K at the end.

Perhaps FRISK or BRISK is a good candidate? But let's see: both test different first letters? F vs B.

Since we don't know about F or B, we can use one of these?

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't assume S at 1 or 4? But S has to be at 1 or 4? We know that.

But to gain more information, we might guess a word that has S at position 1? But earlier we struggled to find one? What about ""SHRIK""? Not a word, I think.

""SKRIM""? Not meaningful.

Actually, ""SPRIG"" has P -> not allowed? P forbidden? Yes.

""SMIRK"": S M I R K -> but R is at position 4? But we need R at position 2? Pattern is wrong: S(1) M(2) I(3) R(4) K(5). But in secret word, R should be at position 2? So feedback would be: R at position 4, but secret has R at position 2? Then if R is only once? It would be marked - for R at position 4? But that might be messy.

Better to stick to the pattern: ? R I ? ?

Therefore, BRISK or FRISK is good.

Now, choose one: let's say BRISK. Why? B is a common starting letter? Or FRISK.

But BRISK: B(1) R(2) I(3) S(4) K(5)

FRISK: F(1) R(2) I(3) S(4) K(5)

We have only one feedback on T,S? But we know S is present? And also, K hasn't been tested.

Since we don't know about B or F, we might choose one arbitrarily.

Another word: ""GRIMY"" but M and Y? And if we put G R I M Y, but position 4 is M, position 5 is Y? Then S is not in the word? But we know S must be in the word? We have to include S? Otherwise, if we don't include S, the feedback would show S missing? But we are guessing a word, and if S is not included, it might be x for S? But S must be in the secret word, so we should include it to find position? If we don't include S, we get no information on S position.

But we can? For example, if we guess ""BRILL"" or something? But then S not tested? That might be inefficient? Because we know S is present, so if we exclude S, we waste an opportunity.

Therefore, better to include S.

So BRISK or FRISK are both valid.

I'll pick BRISK because it's a common word.

So third guess: BRISK

Then we get feedback.

Now, feedback possibilities:
- If secret word is BRISK, then we win? But likely not, but possible.
- Otherwise, position 1 B: if B is in word and position, ✓? Else, if not at 1, but present? Or not present? Similarly, S at position 4: ✓ if position 4, or - if not?
But since S could be at 1 or 4, and in our guess, B is at 1, S at 4.

If secret S is at position 1, then our guess at position 4 S should get - (wrong position)? And B might get x if not present? Or - if present but not position? But we don't know if B is in the word.

Similarly, K at 5.

So through feedback we can deduce.

Therefore, let's go with ""brisk"".

But wait: what if the secret word has S at position 1? Then BRISK has B at 1, which might be present or not, etc.

But it should be fine.

Alternative: guess a word that puts S at position 1 to test? For example, ""S R I M ?"" but what words? ""SHRIM"" not English? Prim? But P forbidden.

""SKRIM"" not a word.

""SWIRL"": but W at position 4? S(1) W(2) I(3) R(4) L(5) -> R is not at position 2? So pattern mismatch.

It would conflict with our fixed R and I positions.

Therefore, it's tricky? So I think BRISK or FRISK is better.

Moreover, there's another word: ""SHRIK""? Not common. ""SKRIP""? Not word.

So BRISK is a valid choice.

Thus, third guess: BRISK.

We'll see.
</think>
### Thought Process:

Given the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is correct and in position 2.  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: trips** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), I(✓), P(x), S(-)  
  - R (position 2) and I (position 3) are correct.  
  - T and P are not in the secret word.  
  - S is present but not in position 5.  

Key deductions:  
1. The secret word pattern is fixed: position 2 is **R**, position 3 is **I**, so the pattern is `_ R I _ _`.  
2. S is in the word but not in position 5 (based on ""-"" feedback). Therefore, S must be in position 1 or position 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are occupied by R and I).  
3. Forbidden letters (not present): C, A, N, E, T, P. Avoid using these.  
4. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, which must be included).  

Goal for the next guess:  
- Test likely positions for S (position 1 or 4) while probing other letters.  
- Choose a valid English word that fits the pattern `_ R I _ _`, includes S, and avoids forbidden letters.  
- Maximize information by covering common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, K, F).  

Candidate words:  
- **BRISK** (B R I S K):  
  - Has B in position 1 to test if it's present/correct.  
  - Places S in position 4 to check if it matches the secret position (if S is at position 4, feedback will show ✓; if S is at position 1, feedback will show ""-"" for S at position 4).  
  - K in position 5 tests K's presence/position.  
  - Avoids forbidden letters; common word.  
- **FRISK** (F R I S K): Similar reasoning but uses F instead of B.  

Choice:  
- **BRISK** is prioritized as B is a more common starting letter than F, and it efficiently tests S position while introducing B and K.  

If BRISK is the secret word, it will solve the puzzle. Otherwise, feedback will clarify:  
- S position: ✓ at position 4 confirms S here; ""-"" suggests S is at position 1.  
- B and K feedback: Reveals new letter presence/positions.

<guess>brisk</guess>",brisk,"We have two sets of feedback.

First guess: ""crane""
- C(x) : C is not in the secret word.
- R(✓): R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A(x): A is not in the secret word.
- N(x): N is not in the secret word.
- E(x): E is not in the secret word.

Second guess: ""trips""
- T(x): T is not in the secret word.
- R(✓): R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2). This matches the first feedback.
- I(✓): I is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3).
- P(x): P is not in the secret word.
- S(-): S is in the secret word but in the wrong position.

From this feedback, we can deduce:
- The secret word has R as the second letter and I as the third letter. So the pattern so far is: _ R I _ _
- S is in the secret word but not in the fourth or fifth position (since in ""trips"", S was at the end, position 5, and it was marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position). So S is somewhere in the word but not at position 5. Since the only other positions available are 1 and 4 (as positions 2 and 3 are taken by R and I), S must be in either position 1 or 4? But wait, in position 4? That's possible. Or position 1? We don't know yet.

Actually, the positions: 
- Position 1: unknown
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: unknown
- Position 5: unknown

And S is in the word but not at position 5 (since it received ""-"", meaning present but wrong position; and at position 5 in the guess, so it can't be at position 5). Therefore, S must be at position 1 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth position.

Wait: the feedback for S is ""-"" and it was guessed at position 5. This means the secret word has S, but not at position 5. Therefore, it could be at position 1 or position 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are occupied by R and I). However, we cannot rule out position 4? Actually, all positions except 2 and 3 are possible, but position 5 is ruled out for S.

So S is at position 1 or position 4.

Additionally, we know that T and P are not in the word (from the ""trips"" feedback: T(x) and P(x)). Also, from first guess, C, A, N, E are out.

So forbidden letters now: C, A, N, E, T, P.

We must use only letters not in this forbidden set.

The secret word pattern: _ R I _ _

Letters known to be in the word: R, I, S? Yes, because S is marked as ""-"".

So S is in the word. And we need to find two more letters? Actually, we have three letters: R, I, S; but the word has five positions, so two more letters.

Moreover, we have position 1 and positions 4-5 that need to be filled, with S possibly at position 1 or 4? But if S is not at position 1, then position 1 is something else and S is at position 4? Also, position 5 is another letter? Let me clarify:

The secret word has 5 positions:
1: ? (could be S or another letter, but we know S must be either at 1 or 4 because if S were at 4, that's one option, or at 1. But if S is at position 4, then position 1 is not S? Similarly, if S is at 1, then position 4 is not S? But S cannot be at position 5, as we know.)

Actually, S could also be at position 4? But we haven't tested position 4? No, in our guesses, we haven't tested S at position 4 yet? In ""trips"", S was at position 5.

So possibilities:
Case 1: S is at position 1 in the secret word.
Case 2: S is at position 4 in the secret word.

But if S were at position 4, then in the pattern _ R I _ _, that would leave position 1 and 5.

However, from the feedback, we also know that S is not at position 5? But position 4 is different? Sorry, I think I confused.

In the secret word, positions:
1: ? 
2: R (fixed)
3: I (fixed)
4: ?
5: ?

S is in the word but not at position 5? Since we guessed S at position 5 and it got ""-"", meaning wrong position. Therefore, S cannot be at position 5. So S must be at one of the positions: 1 or 4 (because positions 2 and 3 are occupied and have different letters).

Therefore, we need to test both possibilities.

Moreover, for the remaining letters, we need to choose a word that fits and gives more information.

Also, we need to avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T, P.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S? Yes, but we are using S? But we are also trying to place S? Actually, S must be included? Or not? Since we know S is in the word, so we should use S in the next guess to find its position.

For the third guess, we should try to determine the position of S and also test other possible letters.

Now, the secret word pattern: positions 1, 4, 5 need letters? With the constraint that S must be one of them but not at position 5? Actually, S must be at position 1 or 4.

Idea: we can guess a word that has S at position 1? For example, ""S _ _ _ _"" and with R and I at positions 2 and 3? Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, we have to guess a word that has the format: ? R I ? ? , but with S either at 1 or 4.

Actually, the word must have R at 2, I at 3. So the structure: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]

S must be either at letter1 or letter4? But if S is at letter1, then letter4 is something else. If S is at letter4, then letter1 is something else.

And letter5 is always not S? Because S cannot be at 5? Correct.

Also, we know S is present, so it must be at 1 or 4.

So possible words: we need to choose letter1, letter4, letter5 from the available letters (excluding C,A,N,E,T,P), with the constraint that one of letter1 or letter4 is S? But we can't assume that? It could be either? So we need to explore.

To maximize information, we should consider guessing a word that can distinguish between these cases.

For example, if we guess a word that has S at position 1, then:
- If the feedback shows ✓ for S at position 1, then we know S is at position 1.
- If it shows ""-"" for S at position 1? Then S must be at position 4? Because if S were at position 1, it should be ✓, and if it were at position 4, then at guess position 1 it might be marked x if not present? Wait no, S is in the word, so if we put S at position 1 and S is actually at position 4, then it should get ""-"" (wrong position).

Similarly, if we put S at position 4, then:
- If S is at position 4, we get ✓.
- If S is at position 1, we get ""-"".

So by playing S at position 1, we can get feedback to pinpoint.

Moreover, we should include other new letters to test for the other positions.

Available letters: let's list the ones we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And S.

But S is mandatory in the word? We are including it? Yes.

Now, what about position 5? Test a common vowel or consonant.

It's also important to note that we must find a valid English word.

Possible words:

Option: if we put S at position 1: then the word must be S R I ? ?

And we need to fill ? and ? with letters not in forbidden list.

Possible endings: 
Examples: SRIS? Not a word. SRID? Not common. SRIM? Not common.

SRIL? Not a word.

S R I with K or L? SRIL is not English.

Common words: ""SHRIM"" - does that exist? Not really. Shrimp is 6 letters.

Another: ""SHRUG"" - that's S H R U G -> but position 3 is U? But we need R at position 2? Wait, ""shrug"": S(1) H(2) R(3) U(4) G(5) -> which doesn't match our pattern (we need R at position 2 and I at position 3).

So we need the pattern: S R I ? ?

What about ""SERIF""? But E is forbidden? Because A? E also forbidden? From first guess E(x).

""serif"" has E -> not allowed.

""SCRIM"" has C -> forbidden.

""STRIP"" has T -> forbidden.

So hard.

Perhaps put S at position 4: then pattern: ? R I S ?

Again, ? R I S ? 

Examples: CRISP? But C forbidden. TRISM? Not a word.

""FRISK"": F R I S K -> F is not forbidden? Forbidden are C,A,N,E,T,P. So F is allowed? F-R-I-S-K: F(1) R(2) I(3) S(4) K(5) -> valid pattern.

FRISK is a word? Yes, meaning to frisk search or lively?

Also, BRISK: B R I S K -> also a word, meaning quick.

Both are valid.

Letters: FRISK has F,R,I,S,K -> all acceptable? F not forbidden, K not forbidden.

Similarly, BRISK: B,R,I,S,K.

We could also think of ""PRISM"" but P forbidden? From second guess P(x), so P is out.

Similarly, ""GRISLY"" too long.

So FRISK and BRISK are candidates.

But we also need to test the position of S? Because in our guess, if we play ""FRISK"", then:

Position 4: S. So if secret word has S at position 4, it would get ✓. If secret word has S at position 1, then in position 4 we have S, which might be x or -? Since S is in the word, but at wrong position? But position 1 would be F, which might be present or not.

Similarly, with BRISK.

But note: we are trying to find the position of S? If we play FRISK:

- If F is not in the word? Then position 1 F might be x? but S would be at position 4? Then for S: if secret S is at position 4, then in guess position 4 S would be ✓? If secret S is at position 1, then in guess position 4 S would be - because wrong position? And F at position 1 would be x if not present? But S at position 4 in this scenario, when secret has S at 1, would be marked as - because S is present but not at position 4.

Similarly, K at the end.

Perhaps FRISK or BRISK is a good candidate? But let's see: both test different first letters? F vs B.

Since we don't know about F or B, we can use one of these?

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't assume S at 1 or 4? But S has to be at 1 or 4? We know that.

But to gain more information, we might guess a word that has S at position 1? But earlier we struggled to find one? What about ""SHRIK""? Not a word, I think.

""SKRIM""? Not meaningful.

Actually, ""SPRIG"" has P -> not allowed? P forbidden? Yes.

""SMIRK"": S M I R K -> but R is at position 4? But we need R at position 2? Pattern is wrong: S(1) M(2) I(3) R(4) K(5). But in secret word, R should be at position 2? So feedback would be: R at position 4, but secret has R at position 2? Then if R is only once? It would be marked - for R at position 4? But that might be messy.

Better to stick to the pattern: ? R I ? ?

Therefore, BRISK or FRISK is good.

Now, choose one: let's say BRISK. Why? B is a common starting letter? Or FRISK.

But BRISK: B(1) R(2) I(3) S(4) K(5)

FRISK: F(1) R(2) I(3) S(4) K(5)

We have only one feedback on T,S? But we know S is present? And also, K hasn't been tested.

Since we don't know about B or F, we might choose one arbitrarily.

Another word: ""GRIMY"" but M and Y? And if we put G R I M Y, but position 4 is M, position 5 is Y? Then S is not in the word? But we know S must be in the word? We have to include S? Otherwise, if we don't include S, the feedback would show S missing? But we are guessing a word, and if S is not included, it might be x for S? But S must be in the secret word, so we should include it to find position? If we don't include S, we get no information on S position.

But we can? For example, if we guess ""BRILL"" or something? But then S not tested? That might be inefficient? Because we know S is present, so if we exclude S, we waste an opportunity.

Therefore, better to include S.

So BRISK or FRISK are both valid.

I'll pick BRISK because it's a common word.

So third guess: BRISK

Then we get feedback.

Now, feedback possibilities:
- If secret word is BRISK, then we win? But likely not, but possible.
- Otherwise, position 1 B: if B is in word and position, ✓? Else, if not at 1, but present? Or not present? Similarly, S at position 4: ✓ if position 4, or - if not?
But since S could be at 1 or 4, and in our guess, B is at 1, S at 4.

If secret S is at position 1, then our guess at position 4 S should get - (wrong position)? And B might get x if not present? Or - if present but not position? But we don't know if B is in the word.

Similarly, K at 5.

So through feedback we can deduce.

Therefore, let's go with ""brisk"".

But wait: what if the secret word has S at position 1? Then BRISK has B at 1, which might be present or not, etc.

But it should be fine.

Alternative: guess a word that puts S at position 1 to test? For example, ""S R I M ?"" but what words? ""SHRIM"" not English? Prim? But P forbidden.

""SKRIM"" not a word.

""SWIRL"": but W at position 4? S(1) W(2) I(3) R(4) L(5) -> R is not at position 2? So pattern mismatch.

It would conflict with our fixed R and I positions.

Therefore, it's tricky? So I think BRISK or FRISK is better.

Moreover, there's another word: ""SHRIK""? Not common. ""SKRIP""? Not word.

So BRISK is a valid choice.

Thus, third guess: BRISK.

We'll see.### Thought Process:

Given the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is correct and in position 2.  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: trips** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), I(✓), P(x), S(-)  
  - R (position 2) and I (position 3) are correct.  
  - T and P are not in the secret word.  
  - S is present but not in position 5.  

Key deductions:  
1. The secret word pattern is fixed: position 2 is **R**, position 3 is **I**, so the pattern is `_ R I _ _`.  
2. S is in the word but not in position 5 (based on ""-"" feedback). Therefore, S must be in position 1 or position 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are occupied by R and I).  
3. Forbidden letters (not present): C, A, N, E, T, P. Avoid using these.  
4. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, which must be included).  

Goal for the next guess:  
- Test likely positions for S (position 1 or 4) while probing other letters.  
- Choose a valid English word that fits the pattern `_ R I _ _`, includes S, and avoids forbidden letters.  
- Maximize information by covering common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, K, F).  

Candidate words:  
- **BRISK** (B R I S K):  
  - Has B in position 1 to test if it's present/correct.  
  - Places S in position 4 to check if it matches the secret position (if S is at position 4, feedback will show ✓; if S is at position 1, feedback will show ""-"" for S at position 4).  
  - K in position 5 tests K's presence/position.  
  - Avoids forbidden letters; common word.  
- **FRISK** (F R I S K): Similar reasoning but uses F instead of B.  

Choice:  
- **BRISK** is prioritized as B is a more common starting letter than F, and it efficiently tests S position while introducing B and K.  

If BRISK is the secret word, it will solve the puzzle. Otherwise, feedback will clarify:  
- S position: ✓ at position 4 confirms S here; ""-"" suggests S is at position 1.  
- B and K feedback: Reveals new letter presence/positions.",Guess 3: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,FRISK,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common consonants and a vowel, and all letters are distinct.

 So, our first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)

Important: R is correct and in the right position? The feedback shows R(✓), which means R is in the word and in the correct position.

But note: in the secret word, R is the second letter (position 2) because in ""crane"", R is the second letter and it got a ✓.

So the secret word has R as the second letter.

Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E (since they got x). And R is confirmed in position 2.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We need to make a second guess. We should avoid using C, A, N, E because they are not in the word (unless we have reason to think otherwise, but feedback says they are not present).

Also, we should include other common letters to test.

List of available letters: Not C, A, N, E. And we know R is fixed in position 2.

Common vowels that might appear: O, I, U (but A and E are out, so possibly O or I).

Common consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (excluding C and R which we know about).

Since R is in position 2, we cannot put R again? We don't know yet if R can repeat, but typically in Wordle, words can have repeated letters? But let's assume it might not. Since we haven't seen feedback indicating repetition, we can avoid for now.

But note: the feedback doesn't show multiple of same letter? Actually, the game handles duplicates: if there are multiple identical letters in the guess, they are treated separately, but the secret word might have fewer.

However, in our case, ""crane"" only has one R, so we don't have information on duplicate R.

It's safer to avoid repeating R until we know it might occur.

Potential words: we need a word that has R as the second letter.

Also, since we have four spots to fill: first, third, fourth, fifth.

Common words with R in second position: like TRY, but that's 3 letters. 5-letter words: BRICK, BRISK, BRINE, etc. But BRINE has E and N which we know are not in the word? Wait, E and N are not in the word, according to feedback.

In the first guess, E was at the end and got x, so E is not present. Similarly, N is not present.

Also, C and A are not present.

So we cannot use the letters C, A, N, E.

Therefore, BRINE has N and E, so not allowed. Similarly, BRICK has C and K? C is not present, so BRICK has C? Actually, BRICK: B R I C K -> C is the fourth letter, which we know is not in the word (since first guess showed C not present).

So BRICK is not possible because it contains C.

Better to choose a word without these forbidden letters.

Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E

Therefore, the new word must not contain C, A, N, E and must have R as the second letter.

What are possible words?

I can think of words like: PROUD, GROUP - but GROUP doesn't have R as second letter? GROUP is G-R-O-U-P -> R is second? G(1), R(2), so yes.

GROUP: has G, R, O, U, P.

But does it have any forbidden letters? C, A, N, E not in GROUP? A and E are vowels, but GROUP uses O and U. So GROUP is okay? It doesn't have C,A,N,E.

However, we need to maximize information. We haven't tested many letters.

Other possibilities: WORDY, but W is less common.

We want to test more common letters.

Common letters: we might test T, S, L, O, I, etc.

So a word with R second, without C,A,N,E, and including other common letters.

Possible words: 
- BROIL: B R O I L -> letters: B,R,O,I,L
- GRIMY: G R I M Y
- PROWL: P R O W L

But BROIL has O and I, which are untested.

Another idea: we know R is fixed, so we can focus on other positions.

Perhaps ""TRYST"" but Y is less common.

Or ""PRISM"": P R I S M

PRISM: P, R, I, S, M. No C,A,N,E.

But S and M are common.

Similarly, we could do ""TRIPS"": T R I P S.

""TRIPS"": T R I P S -> no forbidden letters.

""TRIPS"" and ""PRISM"" are good.

Alternatively, ""PERCH"" but E is forbidden? PERCH has E -> not allowed.

So avoid E.

Another word: ""BROWN"" -> B R O W N -> but N is forbidden? N was in the first guess and not present. So BROWN has N -> invalid.

Therefore, avoid N.

Similarly, ""CRUST"" has C -> invalid.

""TRUST"" has no C,A,N,E? T, R, U, S, T -> R is second, but U and S. Also, it has two T's? We don't know about T yet.

But we can use T.

What about ""TRYST"" -> T R Y S T -> has two T's? But secret word might have T or not? We don't know.

But we can try.

However, perhaps a word without duplicates first.

I think ""PRISM"" or ""TRIPS"" are good.

""PRISM"": P R I S M
""TRIPS"": T R I P S

Both cover common letters.

Let's compare:
PRISM: letters P, R, I, S, M
TRIPS: T, R, I, P, S → essentially P,R,I,S,T and M in PRISM vs T,P,R,I,S.

But TRIPS has P,R,I,S,T which are all common.

Moreover, in TRIPS, we have S and T which we haven't tested.

But note: in TRIPS, the P is first letter? But R is fixed second. So in TRIPS, R is second? T is first, R second, I third, P fourth, S fifth? Yes.

Similarly, in PRISM, P first, R second, I third, S fourth, M fifth.

Both seem fine.

But we have to consider the positions. We want to test letters in different positions to get more feedback.

In particular, we need to test the first position, since it's not fixed.

In the secret word, first letter is one of the unknowns.

So TRIPS has T in first, and PRISM has P in first.

Commonality: T is more common as starter than P? But both are fine.

S is also common.

Another word: ""ROAST"" but R is first in ROAST, but in our case, R is fixed second, so not applicable.

What about ""DRIFT""? But D,R,I,F,T → F is less common, and D?

""DRIFT"" has D,R,I,F,T. Forbidden letters? No C,A,N,E.

But we might want to include vowels? So far we have R, and in PRISM or TRIPS, they have I as vowel.

O is another vowel, but we might not have it yet.

What about ""BROTH""? But O and T,H? Also, BROTH: B R O T H → H is common? But BROTH has O, which is vowel.

But earlier BROIL was also an option without forbidden letters.

Let me list some words that fit:
- BROOK: B R O O K → has two O's? But O is not tested. Invalid if O repeats and secret doesn't have two? But it's okay to guess duplicates.
- PROWS: P R O W S → but W is less common.
- GRIPT: not common.

Perhaps better to go with PRISM or TRIPS.

I'll choose TRIPS because it has T and S, and T is a very common starting letter.

So second guess: TRIPS

That is, T-R-I-P-S.

Then we can get feedback on T, R, I, P, S.

But note: R is already correct and in position, so for R, we expect ✓ again? Unless the word has multiple R? But feedback might show.

Since R is correct in second position, it should be ✓.

Now, if T is in the word or not, I in the word or third position, etc.

After this, we'll have more clues.

So let's go with ""trips"".

But confirm: trips is a valid word? Yes.

Therefore, second guess: trips.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R is correct and in position 2 (✓), meaning the secret word has R as the second letter.
- C, A, N, and E are not in the word (x), so these letters should be avoided in the next guess.
- The secret word now has the pattern: `_ R _ _ _`.

For the second guess:
- Choose a word that includes R in position 2 to maintain its correct placement and test new letters.
- Avoid using C, A, N, or E.
- Prioritize common vowels (like I or O) and consonants (like T, S, P, L) to maximize feedback.
- Good candidates: ""TRIPS"" or ""PRISM"". Both have R in position 2 and avoid forbidden letters. ""TRIPS"" is selected to test T, I, P, and S—common letters not yet evaluated.

<guess>trips</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two sets of feedback.

First guess: ""crane""
- C(x) : C is not in the secret word.
- R(✓): R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
- A(x): A is not in the secret word.
- N(x): N is not in the secret word.
- E(x): E is not in the secret word.

Second guess: ""trips""
- T(x): T is not in the secret word.
- R(✓): R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2). This matches the first feedback.
- I(✓): I is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3).
- P(x): P is not in the secret word.
- S(-): S is in the secret word but in the wrong position.

From this feedback, we can deduce:
- The secret word has R as the second letter and I as the third letter. So the pattern so far is: _ R I _ _
- S is in the secret word but not in the fourth or fifth position (since in ""trips"", S was at the end, position 5, and it was marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position). So S is somewhere in the word but not at position 5. Since the only other positions available are 1 and 4 (as positions 2 and 3 are taken by R and I), S must be in either position 1 or 4? But wait, in position 4? That's possible. Or position 1? We don't know yet.

Actually, the positions: 
- Position 1: unknown
- Position 2: R (fixed)
- Position 3: I (fixed)
- Position 4: unknown
- Position 5: unknown

And S is in the word but not at position 5 (since it received ""-"", meaning present but wrong position; and at position 5 in the guess, so it can't be at position 5). Therefore, S must be at position 1 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth position.

Wait: the feedback for S is ""-"" and it was guessed at position 5. This means the secret word has S, but not at position 5. Therefore, it could be at position 1 or position 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are occupied by R and I). However, we cannot rule out position 4? Actually, all positions except 2 and 3 are possible, but position 5 is ruled out for S.

So S is at position 1 or position 4.

Additionally, we know that T and P are not in the word (from the ""trips"" feedback: T(x) and P(x)). Also, from first guess, C, A, N, E are out.

So forbidden letters now: C, A, N, E, T, P.

We must use only letters not in this forbidden set.

The secret word pattern: _ R I _ _

Letters known to be in the word: R, I, S? Yes, because S is marked as ""-"".

So S is in the word. And we need to find two more letters? Actually, we have three letters: R, I, S; but the word has five positions, so two more letters.

Moreover, we have position 1 and positions 4-5 that need to be filled, with S possibly at position 1 or 4? But if S is not at position 1, then position 1 is something else and S is at position 4? Also, position 5 is another letter? Let me clarify:

The secret word has 5 positions:
1: ? (could be S or another letter, but we know S must be either at 1 or 4 because if S were at 4, that's one option, or at 1. But if S is at position 4, then position 1 is not S? Similarly, if S is at 1, then position 4 is not S? But S cannot be at position 5, as we know.)

Actually, S could also be at position 4? But we haven't tested position 4? No, in our guesses, we haven't tested S at position 4 yet? In ""trips"", S was at position 5.

So possibilities:
Case 1: S is at position 1 in the secret word.
Case 2: S is at position 4 in the secret word.

But if S were at position 4, then in the pattern _ R I _ _, that would leave position 1 and 5.

However, from the feedback, we also know that S is not at position 5? But position 4 is different? Sorry, I think I confused.

In the secret word, positions:
1: ? 
2: R (fixed)
3: I (fixed)
4: ?
5: ?

S is in the word but not at position 5? Since we guessed S at position 5 and it got ""-"", meaning wrong position. Therefore, S cannot be at position 5. So S must be at one of the positions: 1 or 4 (because positions 2 and 3 are occupied and have different letters).

Therefore, we need to test both possibilities.

Moreover, for the remaining letters, we need to choose a word that fits and gives more information.

Also, we need to avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T, P.

So available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S? Yes, but we are using S? But we are also trying to place S? Actually, S must be included? Or not? Since we know S is in the word, so we should use S in the next guess to find its position.

For the third guess, we should try to determine the position of S and also test other possible letters.

Now, the secret word pattern: positions 1, 4, 5 need letters? With the constraint that S must be one of them but not at position 5? Actually, S must be at position 1 or 4.

Idea: we can guess a word that has S at position 1? For example, ""S _ _ _ _"" and with R and I at positions 2 and 3? Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, we have to guess a word that has the format: ? R I ? ? , but with S either at 1 or 4.

Actually, the word must have R at 2, I at 3. So the structure: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]

S must be either at letter1 or letter4? But if S is at letter1, then letter4 is something else. If S is at letter4, then letter1 is something else.

And letter5 is always not S? Because S cannot be at 5? Correct.

Also, we know S is present, so it must be at 1 or 4.

So possible words: we need to choose letter1, letter4, letter5 from the available letters (excluding C,A,N,E,T,P), with the constraint that one of letter1 or letter4 is S? But we can't assume that? It could be either? So we need to explore.

To maximize information, we should consider guessing a word that can distinguish between these cases.

For example, if we guess a word that has S at position 1, then:
- If the feedback shows ✓ for S at position 1, then we know S is at position 1.
- If it shows ""-"" for S at position 1? Then S must be at position 4? Because if S were at position 1, it should be ✓, and if it were at position 4, then at guess position 1 it might be marked x if not present? Wait no, S is in the word, so if we put S at position 1 and S is actually at position 4, then it should get ""-"" (wrong position).

Similarly, if we put S at position 4, then:
- If S is at position 4, we get ✓.
- If S is at position 1, we get ""-"".

So by playing S at position 1, we can get feedback to pinpoint.

Moreover, we should include other new letters to test for the other positions.

Available letters: let's list the ones we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And S.

But S is mandatory in the word? We are including it? Yes.

Now, what about position 5? Test a common vowel or consonant.

It's also important to note that we must find a valid English word.

Possible words:

Option: if we put S at position 1: then the word must be S R I ? ?

And we need to fill ? and ? with letters not in forbidden list.

Possible endings: 
Examples: SRIS? Not a word. SRID? Not common. SRIM? Not common.

SRIL? Not a word.

S R I with K or L? SRIL is not English.

Common words: ""SHRIM"" - does that exist? Not really. Shrimp is 6 letters.

Another: ""SHRUG"" - that's S H R U G -> but position 3 is U? But we need R at position 2? Wait, ""shrug"": S(1) H(2) R(3) U(4) G(5) -> which doesn't match our pattern (we need R at position 2 and I at position 3).

So we need the pattern: S R I ? ?

What about ""SERIF""? But E is forbidden? Because A? E also forbidden? From first guess E(x).

""serif"" has E -> not allowed.

""SCRIM"" has C -> forbidden.

""STRIP"" has T -> forbidden.

So hard.

Perhaps put S at position 4: then pattern: ? R I S ?

Again, ? R I S ? 

Examples: CRISP? But C forbidden. TRISM? Not a word.

""FRISK"": F R I S K -> F is not forbidden? Forbidden are C,A,N,E,T,P. So F is allowed? F-R-I-S-K: F(1) R(2) I(3) S(4) K(5) -> valid pattern.

FRISK is a word? Yes, meaning to frisk search or lively?

Also, BRISK: B R I S K -> also a word, meaning quick.

Both are valid.

Letters: FRISK has F,R,I,S,K -> all acceptable? F not forbidden, K not forbidden.

Similarly, BRISK: B,R,I,S,K.

We could also think of ""PRISM"" but P forbidden? From second guess P(x), so P is out.

Similarly, ""GRISLY"" too long.

So FRISK and BRISK are candidates.

But we also need to test the position of S? Because in our guess, if we play ""FRISK"", then:

Position 4: S. So if secret word has S at position 4, it would get ✓. If secret word has S at position 1, then in position 4 we have S, which might be x or -? Since S is in the word, but at wrong position? But position 1 would be F, which might be present or not.

Similarly, with BRISK.

But note: we are trying to find the position of S? If we play FRISK:

- If F is not in the word? Then position 1 F might be x? but S would be at position 4? Then for S: if secret S is at position 4, then in guess position 4 S would be ✓? If secret S is at position 1, then in guess position 4 S would be - because wrong position? And F at position 1 would be x if not present? But S at position 4 in this scenario, when secret has S at 1, would be marked as - because S is present but not at position 4.

Similarly, K at the end.

Perhaps FRISK or BRISK is a good candidate? But let's see: both test different first letters? F vs B.

Since we don't know about F or B, we can use one of these?

Alternatively, we can guess a word that doesn't assume S at 1 or 4? But S has to be at 1 or 4? We know that.

But to gain more information, we might guess a word that has S at position 1? But earlier we struggled to find one? What about ""SHRIK""? Not a word, I think.

""SKRIM""? Not meaningful.

Actually, ""SPRIG"" has P -> not allowed? P forbidden? Yes.

""SMIRK"": S M I R K -> but R is at position 4? But we need R at position 2? Pattern is wrong: S(1) M(2) I(3) R(4) K(5). But in secret word, R should be at position 2? So feedback would be: R at position 4, but secret has R at position 2? Then if R is only once? It would be marked - for R at position 4? But that might be messy.

Better to stick to the pattern: ? R I ? ?

Therefore, BRISK or FRISK is good.

Now, choose one: let's say BRISK. Why? B is a common starting letter? Or FRISK.

But BRISK: B(1) R(2) I(3) S(4) K(5)

FRISK: F(1) R(2) I(3) S(4) K(5)

We have only one feedback on T,S? But we know S is present? And also, K hasn't been tested.

Since we don't know about B or F, we might choose one arbitrarily.

Another word: ""GRIMY"" but M and Y? And if we put G R I M Y, but position 4 is M, position 5 is Y? Then S is not in the word? But we know S must be in the word? We have to include S? Otherwise, if we don't include S, the feedback would show S missing? But we are guessing a word, and if S is not included, it might be x for S? But S must be in the secret word, so we should include it to find position? If we don't include S, we get no information on S position.

But we can? For example, if we guess ""BRILL"" or something? But then S not tested? That might be inefficient? Because we know S is present, so if we exclude S, we waste an opportunity.

Therefore, better to include S.

So BRISK or FRISK are both valid.

I'll pick BRISK because it's a common word.

So third guess: BRISK

Then we get feedback.

Now, feedback possibilities:
- If secret word is BRISK, then we win? But likely not, but possible.
- Otherwise, position 1 B: if B is in word and position, ✓? Else, if not at 1, but present? Or not present? Similarly, S at position 4: ✓ if position 4, or - if not?
But since S could be at 1 or 4, and in our guess, B is at 1, S at 4.

If secret S is at position 1, then our guess at position 4 S should get - (wrong position)? And B might get x if not present? Or - if present but not position? But we don't know if B is in the word.

Similarly, K at 5.

So through feedback we can deduce.

Therefore, let's go with ""brisk"".

But wait: what if the secret word has S at position 1? Then BRISK has B at 1, which might be present or not, etc.

But it should be fine.

Alternative: guess a word that puts S at position 1 to test? For example, ""S R I M ?"" but what words? ""SHRIM"" not English? Prim? But P forbidden.

""SKRIM"" not a word.

""SWIRL"": but W at position 4? S(1) W(2) I(3) R(4) L(5) -> R is not at position 2? So pattern mismatch.

It would conflict with our fixed R and I positions.

Therefore, it's tricky? So I think BRISK or FRISK is better.

Moreover, there's another word: ""SHRIK""? Not common. ""SKRIP""? Not word.

So BRISK is a valid choice.

Thus, third guess: BRISK.

We'll see.### Thought Process:

Given the feedback from previous guesses:
- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is correct and in position 2.  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.  
- **Guess 2: trips** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), I(✓), P(x), S(-)  
  - R (position 2) and I (position 3) are correct.  
  - T and P are not in the secret word.  
  - S is present but not in position 5.  

Key deductions:  
1. The secret word pattern is fixed: position 2 is **R**, position 3 is **I**, so the pattern is `_ R I _ _`.  
2. S is in the word but not in position 5 (based on ""-"" feedback). Therefore, S must be in position 1 or position 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are occupied by R and I).  
3. Forbidden letters (not present): C, A, N, E, T, P. Avoid using these.  
4. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, which must be included).  

Goal for the next guess:  
- Test likely positions for S (position 1 or 4) while probing other letters.  
- Choose a valid English word that fits the pattern `_ R I _ _`, includes S, and avoids forbidden letters.  
- Maximize information by covering common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, K, F).  

Candidate words:  
- **BRISK** (B R I S K):  
  - Has B in position 1 to test if it's present/correct.  
  - Places S in position 4 to check if it matches the secret position (if S is at position 4, feedback will show ✓; if S is at position 1, feedback will show ""-"" for S at position 4).  
  - K in position 5 tests K's presence/position.  
  - Avoids forbidden letters; common word.  
- **FRISK** (F R I S K): Similar reasoning but uses F instead of B.  

Choice:  
- **BRISK** is prioritized as B is a more common starting letter than F, and it efficiently tests S position while introducing B and K.  

If BRISK is the secret word, it will solve the puzzle. Otherwise, feedback will clarify:  
- S position: ✓ at position 4 confirms S here; ""-"" suggests S is at position 1.  
- B and K feedback: Reveals new letter presence/positions.

But D,R,I,F,T → F is less common, and D?\n\n""DRIFT"" has D,R,I,F,T. Forbidden letters? No C,A,N,E.\n\nBut we might want to include vowels? So far we have R, and in PRISM or TRIPS, they have I as vowel.\n\nO is another vowel, but we might not have it yet.\n\nWhat about ""BROTH""? But O and T,H? Also, BROTH: B R O T H → H is common? But BROTH has O, which is vowel.\n\nBut earlier BROIL was also an option without forbidden letters.\n\nLet me list some words that fit:\n- BROOK: B R O O K → has two O\'s? But O is not tested. Invalid if O repeats and secret doesn\'t have two? But it\'s okay to guess duplicates.\n- PROWS: P R O W S → but W is less common.\n- GRIPT: not common.\n\nPerhaps better to go with PRISM or TRIPS.\n\nI\'ll choose TRIPS because it has T and S, and T is a very common starting letter.\n\nSo second guess: TRIPS\n\nThat is, T-R-I-P-S.\n\nThen we can get feedback on T, R, I, P, S.\n\nBut note: R is already correct and in position, so for R, we expect ✓ again? Unless the word has multiple R? But feedback might show.\n\nSince R is correct in second position, it should be ✓.\n\nNow, if T is in the word or not, I in the word or third position, etc.\n\nAfter this, we\'ll have more clues.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""trips"".\n\nBut confirm: trips is a valid word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, second guess: trips.After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R is correct and in position 2 (✓), meaning the secret word has R as the second letter.\n- C, A, N, and E are not in the word (x), so these letters should be avoided in the next guess.\n- The secret word now has the pattern: `_ R _ _ _`.\n\nFor the second guess:\n- Choose a word that includes R in position 2 to maintain its correct placement and test new letters.\n- Avoid using C, A, N, or E.\n- Prioritize common vowels (like I or O) and consonants (like T, S, P, L) to maximize feedback.\n- Good candidates: ""TRIPS"" or ""PRISM"". Both have R in position 2 and avoid forbidden letters. ""TRIPS"" is selected to test T, I, P, and S—common letters not yet evaluated.\n\n<guess>trips</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two sets of feedback.\n\nFirst guess: ""crane""\n- C(x) : C is not in the secret word.\n- R(✓): R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).\n- A(x): A is not in the secret word.\n- N(x): N is not in the secret word.\n- E(x): E is not in the secret word.\n\nSecond guess: ""trips""\n- T(x): T is not in the secret word.\n- R(✓): R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2). This matches the first feedback.\n- I(✓): I is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 3).\n- P(x): P is not in the secret word.\n- S(-): S is in the secret word but in the wrong position.\n\nFrom this feedback, we can deduce:\n- The secret word has R as the second letter and I as the third letter. So the pattern so far is: _ R I _ _\n- S is in the secret word but not in the fourth or fifth position (since in ""trips"", S was at the end, position 5, and it was marked as ""-"" meaning wrong position). So S is somewhere in the word but not at position 5. Since the only other positions available are 1 and 4 (as positions 2 and 3 are taken by R and I), S must be in either position 1 or 4? But wait, in position 4? That\'s possible. Or position 1? We don\'t know yet.\n\nActually, the positions: \n- Position 1: unknown\n- Position 2: R (fixed)\n- Position 3: I (fixed)\n- Position 4: unknown\n- Position 5: unknown\n\nAnd S is in the word but not at position 5 (since it received ""-"", meaning present but wrong position; and at position 5 in the guess, so it can\'t be at position 5). Therefore, S must be at position 1 or 4? But position 4 is the fourth position.\n\nWait: the feedback for S is ""-"" and it was guessed at position 5. This means the secret word has S, but not at position 5. Therefore, it could be at position 1 or position 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are occupied by R and I). However, we cannot rule out position 4? Actually, all positions except 2 and 3 are possible, but position 5 is ruled out for S.\n\nSo S is at position 1 or position 4.\n\nAdditionally, we know that T and P are not in the word (from the ""trips"" feedback: T(x) and P(x)). Also, from first guess, C, A, N, E are out.\n\nSo forbidden letters now: C, A, N, E, T, P.\n\nWe must use only letters not in this forbidden set.\n\nThe secret word pattern: _ R I _ _\n\nLetters known to be in the word: R, I, S? Yes, because S is marked as ""-"".\n\nSo S is in the word. And we need to find two more letters? Actually, we have three letters: R, I, S; but the word has five positions, so two more letters.\n\nMoreover, we have position 1 and positions 4-5 that need to be filled, with S possibly at position 1 or 4? But if S is not at position 1, then position 1 is something else and S is at position 4? Also, position 5 is another letter? Let me clarify:\n\nThe secret word has 5 positions:\n1: ? (could be S or another letter, but we know S must be either at 1 or 4 because if S were at 4, that\'s one option, or at 1. But if S is at position 4, then position 1 is not S? Similarly, if S is at 1, then position 4 is not S? But S cannot be at position 5, as we know.)\n\nActually, S could also be at position 4? But we haven\'t tested position 4? No, in our guesses, we haven\'t tested S at position 4 yet? In ""trips"", S was at position 5.\n\nSo possibilities:\nCase 1: S is at position 1 in the secret word.\nCase 2: S is at position 4 in the secret word.\n\nBut if S were at position 4, then in the pattern _ R I _ _, that would leave position 1 and 5.\n\nHowever, from the feedback, we also know that S is not at position 5? But position 4 is different? Sorry, I think I confused.\n\nIn the secret word, positions:\n1: ? \n2: R (fixed)\n3: I (fixed)\n4: ?\n5: ?\n\nS is in the word but not at position 5? Since we guessed S at position 5 and it got ""-"", meaning wrong position. Therefore, S cannot be at position 5. So S must be at one of the positions: 1 or 4 (because positions 2 and 3 are occupied and have different letters).\n\nTherefore, we need to test both possibilities.\n\nMoreover, for the remaining letters, we need to choose a word that fits and gives more information.\n\nAlso, we need to avoid forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T, P.\n\nSo available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S? Yes, but we are using S? But we are also trying to place S? Actually, S must be included? Or not? Since we know S is in the word, so we should use S in the next guess to find its position.\n\nFor the third guess, we should try to determine the position of S and also test other possible letters.\n\nNow, the secret word pattern: positions 1, 4, 5 need letters? With the constraint that S must be one of them but not at position 5? Actually, S must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nIdea: we can guess a word that has S at position 1? For example, ""S _ _ _ _"" and with R and I at positions 2 and 3? Since positions 2 and 3 are fixed, we have to guess a word that has the format: ? R I ? ? , but with S either at 1 or 4.\n\nActually, the word must have R at 2, I at 3. So the structure: [letter1] R I [letter4] [letter5]\n\nS must be either at letter1 or letter4? But if S is at letter1, then letter4 is something else. If S is at letter4, then letter1 is something else.\n\nAnd letter5 is always not S? Because S cannot be at 5? Correct.\n\nAlso, we know S is present, so it must be at 1 or 4.\n\nSo possible words: we need to choose letter1, letter4, letter5 from the available letters (excluding C,A,N,E,T,P), with the constraint that one of letter1 or letter4 is S? But we can\'t assume that? It could be either? So we need to explore.\n\nTo maximize information, we should consider guessing a word that can distinguish between these cases.\n\nFor example, if we guess a word that has S at position 1, then:\n- If the feedback shows ✓ for S at position 1, then we know S is at position 1.\n- If it shows ""-"" for S at position 1? Then S must be at position 4? Because if S were at position 1, it should be ✓, and if it were at position 4, then at guess position 1 it might be marked x if not present? Wait no, S is in the word, so if we put S at position 1 and S is actually at position 4, then it should get ""-"" (wrong position).\n\nSimilarly, if we put S at position 4, then:\n- If S is at position 4, we get ✓.\n- If S is at position 1, we get ""-"".\n\nSo by playing S at position 1, we can get feedback to pinpoint.\n\nMoreover, we should include other new letters to test for the other positions.\n\nAvailable letters: let\'s list the ones we haven\'t tried: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? And S.\n\nBut S is mandatory in the word? We are including it? Yes.\n\nNow, what about position 5? Test a common vowel or consonant.\n\nIt\'s also important to note that we must find a valid English word.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption: if we put S at position 1: then the word must be S R I ? ?\n\nAnd we need to fill ? and ? with letters not in forbidden list.\n\nPossible endings: \nExamples: SRIS? Not a word. SRID? Not common. SRIM? Not common.\n\nSRIL? Not a word.\n\nS R I with K or L? SRIL is not English.\n\nCommon words: ""SHRIM"" - does that exist? Not really. Shrimp is 6 letters.\n\nAnother: ""SHRUG"" - that\'s S H R U G -> but position 3 is U? But we need R at position 2? Wait, ""shrug"": S(1) H(2) R(3) U(4) G(5) -> which doesn\'t match our pattern (we need R at position 2 and I at position 3).\n\nSo we need the pattern: S R I ? ?\n\nWhat about ""SERIF""? But E is forbidden? Because A? E also forbidden? From first guess E(x).\n\n""serif"" has E -> not allowed.\n\n""SCRIM"" has C -> forbidden.\n\n""STRIP"" has T -> forbidden.\n\nSo hard.\n\nPerhaps put S at position 4: then pattern: ? R I S ?\n\nAgain, ? R I S ? \n\nExamples: CRISP? But C forbidden. TRISM? Not a word.\n\n""FRISK"": F R I S K -> F is not forbidden? Forbidden are C,A,N,E,T,P. So F is allowed? F-R-I-S-K: F(1) R(2) I(3) S(4) K(5) -> valid pattern.\n\nFRISK is a word? Yes, meaning to frisk search or lively?\n\nAlso, BRISK: B R I S K -> also a word, meaning quick.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nLetters: FRISK has F,R,I,S,K -> all acceptable? F not forbidden, K not forbidden.\n\nSimilarly, BRISK: B,R,I,S,K.\n\nWe could also think of ""PRISM"" but P forbidden? From second guess P(x), so P is out.\n\nSimilarly, ""GRISLY"" too long.\n\nSo FRISK and BRISK are candidates.\n\nBut we also need to test the position of S? Because in our guess, if we play ""FRISK"", then:\n\nPosition 4: S. So if secret word has S at position 4, it would get ✓. If secret word has S at position 1, then in position 4 we have S, which might be x or -? Since S is in the word, but at wrong position? But position 1 would be F, which might be present or not.\n\nSimilarly, with BRISK.\n\nBut note: we are trying to find the position of S? If we play FRISK:\n\n- If F is not in the word? Then position 1 F might be x? but S would be at position 4? Then for S: if secret S is at position 4, then in guess position 4 S would be ✓? If secret S is at position 1, then in guess position 4 S would be - because wrong position? And F at position 1 would be x if not present? But S at position 4 in this scenario, when secret has S at 1, would be marked as - because S is present but not at position 4.\n\nSimilarly, K at the end.\n\nPerhaps FRISK or BRISK is a good candidate? But let\'s see: both test different first letters? F vs B.\n\nSince we don\'t know about F or B, we can use one of these?\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that doesn\'t assume S at 1 or 4? But S has to be at 1 or 4? We know that.\n\nBut to gain more information, we might guess a word that has S at position 1? But earlier we struggled to find one? What about ""SHRIK""? Not a word, I think.\n\n""SKRIM""? Not meaningful.\n\nActually, ""SPRIG"" has P -> not allowed? P forbidden? Yes.\n\n""SMIRK"": S M I R K -> but R is at position 4? But we need R at position 2? Pattern is wrong: S(1) M(2) I(3) R(4) K(5). But in secret word, R should be at position 2? So feedback would be: R at position 4, but secret has R at position 2? Then if R is only once? It would be marked - for R at position 4? But that might be messy.\n\nBetter to stick to the pattern: ? R I ? ?\n\nTherefore, BRISK or FRISK is good.\n\nNow, choose one: let\'s say BRISK. Why? B is a common starting letter? Or FRISK.\n\nBut BRISK: B(1) R(2) I(3) S(4) K(5)\n\nFRISK: F(1) R(2) I(3) S(4) K(5)\n\nWe have only one feedback on T,S? But we know S is present? And also, K hasn\'t been tested.\n\nSince we don\'t know about B or F, we might choose one arbitrarily.\n\nAnother word: ""GRIMY"" but M and Y? And if we put G R I M Y, but position 4 is M, position 5 is Y? Then S is not in the word? But we know S must be in the word? We have to include S? Otherwise, if we don\'t include S, the feedback would show S missing? But we are guessing a word, and if S is not included, it might be x for S? But S must be in the secret word, so we should include it to find position? If we don\'t include S, we get no information on S position.\n\nBut we can? For example, if we guess ""BRILL"" or something? But then S not tested? That might be inefficient? Because we know S is present, so if we exclude S, we waste an opportunity.\n\nTherefore, better to include S.\n\nSo BRISK or FRISK are both valid.\n\nI\'ll pick BRISK because it\'s a common word.\n\nSo third guess: BRISK\n\nThen we get feedback.\n\nNow, feedback possibilities:\n- If secret word is BRISK, then we win? But likely not, but possible.\n- Otherwise, position 1 B: if B is in word and position, ✓? Else, if not at 1, but present? Or not present? Similarly, S at position 4: ✓ if position 4, or - if not?\nBut since S could be at 1 or 4, and in our guess, B is at 1, S at 4.\n\nIf secret S is at position 1, then our guess at position 4 S should get - (wrong position)? And B might get x if not present? Or - if present but not position? But we don\'t know if B is in the word.\n\nSimilarly, K at 5.\n\nSo through feedback we can deduce.\n\nTherefore, let\'s go with ""brisk"".\n\nBut wait: what if the secret word has S at position 1? Then BRISK has B at 1, which might be present or not, etc.\n\nBut it should be fine.\n\nAlternative: guess a word that puts S at position 1 to test? For example, ""S R I M ?"" but what words? ""SHRIM"" not English? Prim? But P forbidden.\n\n""SKRIM"" not a word.\n\n""SWIRL"": but W at position 4? S(1) W(2) I(3) R(4) L(5) -> R is not at position 2? So pattern mismatch.\n\nIt would conflict with our fixed R and I positions.\n\nTherefore, it\'s tricky? So I think BRISK or FRISK is better.\n\nMoreover, there\'s another word: ""SHRIK""? Not common. ""SKRIP""? Not word.\n\nSo BRISK is a valid choice.\n\nThus, third guess: BRISK.\n\nWe\'ll see.### Thought Process:\n\nGiven the feedback from previous guesses:\n- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n  - R is correct and in position 2.  \n  - C, A, N, E are not in the secret word.  \n- **Guess 2: trips** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), I(✓), P(x), S(-)  \n  - R (position 2) and I (position 3) are correct.  \n  - T and P are not in the secret word.  \n  - S is present but not in position 5.  \n\nKey deductions:  \n1. The secret word pattern is fixed: position 2 is **R**, position 3 is **I**, so the pattern is `_ R I _ _`.  \n2. S is in the word but not in position 5 (based on ""-"" feedback). Therefore, S must be in position 1 or position 4 (since positions 2 and 3 are occupied by R and I).  \n3. Forbidden letters (not present): C, A, N, E, T, P. Avoid using these.  \n4. Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and S, which must be included).  \n\nGoal for the next guess:  \n- Test likely positions for S (position 1 or 4) while probing other letters.  \n- Choose a valid English word that fits the pattern `_ R I _ _`, includes S, and avoids forbidden letters.  \n- Maximize information by covering common letters not yet tested (e.g., B, K, F).  \n\nCandidate words:  \n- **BRISK** (B R I S K):  \n  - Has B in position 1 to test if it\'s present/correct.  \n  - Places S in position 4 to check if it matches the secret position (if S is at position 4, feedback will show ✓; if S is at position 1, feedback will show ""-"" for S at position 4).  \n  - K in position 5 tests K\'s presence/position.  \n  - Avoids forbidden letters; common word.  \n- **FRISK** (F R I S K): Similar reasoning but uses F instead of B.  \n\nChoice:  \n- **BRISK** is prioritized as B is a more common starting letter than F, and it efficiently tests S position while introducing B and K.  \n\nIf BRISK is the secret word, it will solve the puzzle. Otherwise, feedback will clarify:  \n- S position: ✓ at position 4 confirms S here; ""-"" suggests S is at position 1.  \n- B and K feedback: Reveals new letter presence/positions.\n\n<guess>brisk</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: trips -> FEEDBACK: T(x) R(✓) I(✓) P(x) S(-)\nGuess 3: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the third guess ""brisk"": B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

This means:
- B is not in the word (x)
- R is correct and in position 2 (✓)
- I is correct and in position 3 (✓)
- S is correct and in position 4 (✓)  [since it got ✓, meaning it's in the correct position]
- K is correct and in position 5 (✓)

Therefore, the secret word is: _ R I S K

We know the last four letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), S (pos4), K (pos5). Only the first letter is missing.

From feedback, we also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, T, P, B (from the x's in previous guesses).

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with a letter (let's call it X) and then ""RISK"", so the word is X + ""RISK"".

The first letter X must be a letter that is not in the forbidden list (C, A, N, E, T, P, B) and must form a valid English word.

Common words ending with ""RISK"": 
- FRISK: but F is not forbidden? We haven't tested F. Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T, P, B. So F is allowed.
- Other possibilities: BRISK is already guessed and B is out. What about GRISK? Not a word. DRISK? Not a word.

Actually, the only common word is ""FRISK"".

But let's confirm: 
- FRISK: F-R-I-S-K -> which matches the pattern.

Are there others? 
- PRISK? Not a word, and P is forbidden.
- TRISK? Not common, and T is forbidden.
- ARISK? Not a word, and A is forbidden.
- CRISK? Not a word, and C forbidden.
- ERISK? Not a word, E forbidden.
- KRISK? Not a word? K is already at the end, but we need a letter at the beginning.

So the only common word is ""FRISK"".

Therefore, we should guess ""FRISK"".

But note: we haven't tested F before? So it might be F.

In the feedback for ""brisk"", we got S(✓) at position 4 and K(✓) at position 5, so the word ends with ""SK"". And R and I are fixed. So the word is ? R I S K.

With F at the beginning: FRISK.

If we guess FRISK, and it's correct, we get all ✓.

If not, then we need to think of other possibilities? But what are they? ""WRISK""? Not a word. ""RISKY"" is 5 letters but ends with Y? No, we have R I S K, so the last letter is K, not Y.

""RISK"" is 4 letters? So no.

Other possibilities: ""DRISK"" is not a standard word. ""GRISK"" not found.

So FRISK is the only common English word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""frisk"".

But let's double-check the forbidden letters: 
- F is not forbidden (not in C,A,N,E,T,P,B).
- We have R,I,S,K already confirmed.

So the secret word must be FRISK.

Thus, fourth guess: FRISK.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word and correctly placed at position 2.  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  
- **Guess 2: trips** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), I(✓), P(x), S(-)  
  - R (position 2) and I (position 3) are correct.  
  - T and P are not in the word.  
  - S is in the word but not at position 5.  
- **Guess 3: brisk** → Feedback: B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(✓), K(✓)  
  - R (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4), and K (position 5) are all correct.  
  - B is not in the word.  

### Deductions:  
1. The secret word pattern is now fully determined except for position 1: `_ R I S K`.  
2. **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
   - Position 2: R (fixed)  
   - Position 3: I (fixed)  
   - Position 4: S (fixed)  
   - Position 5: K (fixed)  
3. **Forbidden letters (absent from the word)**: C, A, N, E, T, P, B (from all ""x"" feedback).  
4. The only missing letter is at position 1. It must:  
   - Be a valid English letter not in the forbidden list.  
   - Form a real 5-letter word when combined with ""RISK"".  

### Analysis for Position 1:  
- The only common English word fitting `_ R I S K` is **FRISK** (F-R-I-S-K).  
- F is not forbidden (not in C, A, N, E, T, P, B) and is a plausible starting letter.  
- Other combinations (e.g., GRISK, DRISK, WRISK) are not valid English words.  

### Conclusion:  
The secret word must be **FRISK**. This guess will confirm if F is the correct starting letter. If correct, all positions will match (✓).  

<guess>frisk</guess>",frisk,"We have the feedback from the third guess ""brisk"": B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

This means:
- B is not in the word (x)
- R is correct and in position 2 (✓)
- I is correct and in position 3 (✓)
- S is correct and in position 4 (✓)  [since it got ✓, meaning it's in the correct position]
- K is correct and in position 5 (✓)

Therefore, the secret word is: _ R I S K

We know the last four letters: R (pos2), I (pos3), S (pos4), K (pos5). Only the first letter is missing.

From feedback, we also know that the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, E, T, P, B (from the x's in previous guesses).

We need to find a 5-letter word that starts with a letter (let's call it X) and then ""RISK"", so the word is X + ""RISK"".

The first letter X must be a letter that is not in the forbidden list (C, A, N, E, T, P, B) and must form a valid English word.

Common words ending with ""RISK"": 
- FRISK: but F is not forbidden? We haven't tested F. Forbidden letters: C, A, N, E, T, P, B. So F is allowed.
- Other possibilities: BRISK is already guessed and B is out. What about GRISK? Not a word. DRISK? Not a word.

Actually, the only common word is ""FRISK"".

But let's confirm: 
- FRISK: F-R-I-S-K -> which matches the pattern.

Are there others? 
- PRISK? Not a word, and P is forbidden.
- TRISK? Not common, and T is forbidden.
- ARISK? Not a word, and A is forbidden.
- CRISK? Not a word, and C forbidden.
- ERISK? Not a word, E forbidden.
- KRISK? Not a word? K is already at the end, but we need a letter at the beginning.

So the only common word is ""FRISK"".

Therefore, we should guess ""FRISK"".

But note: we haven't tested F before? So it might be F.

In the feedback for ""brisk"", we got S(✓) at position 4 and K(✓) at position 5, so the word ends with ""SK"". And R and I are fixed. So the word is ? R I S K.

With F at the beginning: FRISK.

If we guess FRISK, and it's correct, we get all ✓.

If not, then we need to think of other possibilities? But what are they? ""WRISK""? Not a word. ""RISKY"" is 5 letters but ends with Y? No, we have R I S K, so the last letter is K, not Y.

""RISK"" is 4 letters? So no.

Other possibilities: ""DRISK"" is not a standard word. ""GRISK"" not found.

So FRISK is the only common English word that fits.

Therefore, we guess ""frisk"".

But let's double-check the forbidden letters: 
- F is not forbidden (not in C,A,N,E,T,P,B).
- We have R,I,S,K already confirmed.

So the secret word must be FRISK.

Thus, fourth guess: FRISK.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → Feedback: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
  - R is in the word and correctly placed at position 2.  
  - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  
- **Guess 2: trips** → Feedback: T(x), R(✓), I(✓), P(x), S(-)  
  - R (position 2) and I (position 3) are correct.  
  - T and P are not in the word.  
  - S is in the word but not at position 5.  
- **Guess 3: brisk** → Feedback: B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(✓), K(✓)  
  - R (position 2), I (position 3), S (position 4), and K (position 5) are all correct.  
  - B is not in the word.  

### Deductions:  
1. The secret word pattern is now fully determined except for position 1: `_ R I S K`.  
2. **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
   - Position 2: R (fixed)  
   - Position 3: I (fixed)  
   - Position 4: S (fixed)  
   - Position 5: K (fixed)  
3. **Forbidden letters (absent from the word)**: C, A, N, E, T, P, B (from all ""x"" feedback).  
4. The only missing letter is at position 1. It must:  
   - Be a valid English letter not in the forbidden list.  
   - Form a real 5-letter word when combined with ""RISK"".  

### Analysis for Position 1:  
- The only common English word fitting `_ R I S K` is **FRISK** (F-R-I-S-K).  
- F is not forbidden (not in C, A, N, E, T, P, B) and is a plausible starting letter.  
- Other combinations (e.g., GRISK, DRISK, WRISK) are not valid English words.  

### Conclusion:  
The secret word must be **FRISK**. This guess will confirm if F is the correct starting letter. If correct, all positions will match (✓).",Guess 4: frisk -> FEEDBACK: F(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓),SUCCESS
