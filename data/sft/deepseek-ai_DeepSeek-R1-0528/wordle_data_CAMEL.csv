First, I need to make the first guess for a 5-letter word. Since I don't have any feedback yet, I should choose a word that is common and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. This might help me get useful feedback for narrowing down the secret word.

Common first guesses in word games like Wordle often include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""RAISE"". These words use frequent letters and cover multiple vowels.

I recall that in Wordle, some strategies aim to use words that include letters that appear often in English words. For example, vowels like A, E, I, O, U are important, and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. So, for an optimal first guess, I should include several of these high-frequency letters.

A popular starting word is ""ARISE"" because it contains common letters: A, R, I, S, E. That covers vowels and frequent consonants.

Another good one is ""CRATE"" with C, R, A, T, E.

Or ""SALET"" – but I think ""SALET"" is less common; I should stick with familiar words.

""ROATE"" is another option, but ""RAISE"" seems solid.

For my first guess, I'll go with ""ARISE"". It has three vowels (A, I, E) and two consonants (R, S), which should give good coverage.

After guessing ""ARISE"", the feedback will tell me which letters are correct, present but wrong position, or absent.

Since this is the first guess, I don't have prior feedback, so ""ARISE"" should be fine.

Finally, I need to output the guess in the specified format: <guess>ARISE</guess>.

But before that, I have to include my thought process within </think> tags.

For the first guess, I need to select a 5-letter English word with no prior feedback. To maximize information gain, I should choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants based on English letter frequency. Common starting words in similar games include ""ARISE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", or ""SLATE"", as they cover frequent letters like A, E, I, O, R, S, T, and N.

Among these, ""ARISE"" is a strong choice because:
- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).
- Vowels A, E, and I are among the most frequently used letters.
- Consonants R and S are also high-frequency, which increases the chance of getting useful feedback (correct positions or presence).
- The word is familiar and valid in English.

After this guess, the feedback will indicate which letters are correct (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x), helping me narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

Therefore, I'll start with ""ARISE"".

We are given feedback on the first guess ""ARISE"":
 A: - (present but wrong position)
 R: x (not in the word)
 I: x (not in the word)
 S: x (not in the word)
 E: - (present but wrong position)

 So, from this we know:
 - The word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions we guessed (position 1 and 5 respectively).
 - The word does NOT contain R, I, or S.

 Therefore, we must avoid using R, I, S in our next guess.

 Also, note that A and E are in the word, but not at the beginning or the end (since we had A at position 1 and E at position 5 and they were marked as wrong position).

 We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that uses common letters and avoids the excluded ones.

 Since we know A and E are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Does not contain R, I, S.
 - Contains A and E (but not at position 1 or 5? Actually, they could be at position 1 or 5 but not in the same positions as before? Actually, the feedback says they are present but in the wrong position. So for A, since we put it in position 1 and it's wrong, it cannot be at position 1. Similarly, E cannot be at position 5.

 However, note: the feedback does not necessarily say that the letter cannot be in that position if it appears again? But in this case, we only have one A and one E in the guess. So the word has at least one A (not at position 1) and at least one E (not at position 5).

 We also have three letters that are absent: R, I, S.

 We can try to use other common letters: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E (in positions that are not 1 for A and not 5 for E) and also includes other common letters.

 Possible positions for A: 2, 3, 4, 5? But note: we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. So E is in the word but not at 5. Similarly, A is in the word but not at 1. However, A could be at 5? Yes, because we haven't tried A at 5. Similarly, E could be at 1? But we haven't tried E at 1.

 Actually, we don't know about E at position 1 because we only had it at position 5. Similarly, we don't know about A at positions 2,3,4,5 (except that it's not at 1). But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and E and avoid R, I, S.

 Some ideas: 
 - We could try ""LATEN"" but that's not a word? 
 - How about ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E. 
   - A is at position 3 (which is not 1) and E is at position 5 (but we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E was in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at 5 and A at 1.

 In ""PLATE"":
   A is at position 3 (which is okay, because we haven't tried A at 3 and we know it's not at 1) and E is at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we should avoid that.

 We need to put E in a position that is not 5. And A in a position that is not 1.

 How about ""LEANT""? 
   L, E, A, N, T.
   E is at position 2 (not 5) and A is at position 3 (not 1). Also, no R, I, S.

 But is ""LEANT"" a valid word? Yes, it is (past tense of lean).

 Alternatively, we could try ""OCEAN"", but note that we have O, C, E, A, N. However, we don't know if O, C, or N are in the word. Also, E is at position 3 and A at position 4? And we avoid R,I,S.

 But note: we have two letters we know: A and E. We want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Another idea: ""ADOBE"" -> A at position 1? But we know A cannot be at position 1. So that's invalid for A.

 How about ""BEADY""? 
   B, E, A, D, Y.
   E at position 2 (not 5) and A at position 3 (not 1). And no R,I,S.

 But we don't know if B, D, Y are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and E and also includes other vowels? But we know I is not in the word, so we avoid I.

 Another common word: ""LATER"" -> but R is excluded, so we cannot use R.

 So let's avoid R, I, S.

 I think ""LEANT"" is a good candidate.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 However, in our first guess, we had distinct letters and the feedback didn't show any duplicate marks, so probably the secret word has distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have evidence of duplicates.

 Let's go with ""LEANT"".

 Alternatively, we can use ""TALON"", but that doesn't have E. We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 Another word: ""ALONE"" -> 
   A at position 1: but we know A is not at position 1? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So we cannot put A at position 1. Therefore, ""ALONE"" is invalid because A is at 1.

 How about ""OUNCE""? It has E at the end? But we know E is not at 5? Actually, we don't know if E is at 5? The feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 5. So we must avoid putting E at 5. In ""OUNCE"", E is at 5 -> invalid.

 Another word: ""MANGE"" -> M, A, N, G, E. 
   A at position 2 (okay) and E at position 5 (not okay).

 So we avoid E at 5.

 How about ""AGLET""? But A is at 1 -> invalid.

 How about ""TEPAL""? It's a word? (a type of plant part) 
   T, E, P, A, L -> E at 2, A at 4. This avoids the forbidden positions and letters.

 But we don't know if T, P, L are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLACE"": 
   P, L, A, C, E -> A at 3 (okay) but E at 5 (not okay).

 So we need a word that has E in positions 1,2,3, or 4 and A in positions 2,3,4,5 (but not 1).

 Let me think of words that have A and E and avoid R,I,S, and with A not at 1 and E not at 5.

 Some options:
 - ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> A at 2, E at 4. (valid)
 - ""CAVEM"": not a word.
 - ""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4. (valid)
 - ""DAVIT"": D, A, V, I, T -> but I is excluded -> invalid.

 I think ""HAVEN"" is a good choice. It uses H, V, N which are common.

 But note: we don't know if H, V, N are in the word. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has as many new common letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""CHANT"": but no E -> invalid.

 How about ""LEACH"": L, E, A, C, H -> 
   E at position 2 (okay) and A at position 3 (okay). And no E at 5 and no A at 1.

 But we have to avoid R,I,S and we did.

 So ""LEACH"" is a valid word.

 However, we already have A and E in the word, and we are introducing L, C, H.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: LEANT -> L, E, A, N, T
 Option 2: HAVEN -> H, A, V, E, N
 Option 3: LEACH -> L, E, A, C, H

 We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, N, ... but we know R is excluded. So next are O, T, N, L, etc.

 In LEANT: we have E, A, N, T, L -> that covers T and N and L.
 In HAVEN: we have H, A, V, E, N -> V is less common.
 In LEACH: we have L, E, A, C, H -> C and H are common, but we already have L and E and A.

 I think LEANT is a good choice because it includes T and N which are very common.

 So I'll go with ""LEANT"".

 But wait, we have to make sure that we are not putting a letter in a position that we already know is wrong for that letter? We don't have any information about the positions of A and E except that they are not at 1 and 5 respectively. In LEANT, A is at 3 and E at 2. We haven't tried A at 3 or E at 2, so that's okay.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""LEANT"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""ARISE"":
- A is present but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked with `-`).
- R, I, and S are absent (marked with `x`), so they can be excluded from future guesses.

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (not in position 1) and **E** (not in position 5).
- Must avoid R, I, and S entirely.
- Should prioritize common letters to maximize new information (e.g., L, N, T).

The word **LEANT** fits these criteria:
- Places A in position 3 (new position to test).
- Places E in position 2 (new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: L, N, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, I, S).

 Actually, we don't know about E at position 1 because we only had it at position 5. Similarly, we don't know about A at positions 2,3,4,5 (except that it's not at 1). But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

 Let me think of words that have A and E and avoid R,I,S, and with A not at 1 and E not at 5.

 Some options:
 - ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> A at 2, E at 4. (valid)
 - ""CAVEM"": not a word.
 - ""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4. (valid)
 - ""DAVIT"": D, A, V, I, T -> but I is excluded -> invalid.

 I think ""HAVEN"" is a good choice. It uses H, V, N which are common.

 But note: we don't know if H, V, N are in the word. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has as many new common letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""CHANT"": but no E -> invalid.

 How about ""LEACH"": L, E, A, C, H -> 
   E at position 2 (okay) and A at position 3 (okay). And no E at 5 and no A at 1.

 But we have to avoid R,I,S and we did.

 So ""LEACH"" is a valid word.

 However, we already have A and E in the word, and we are introducing L, C, H.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: LEANT -> L, E, A, N, T
 Option 2: HAVEN -> H, A, V, E, N
 Option 3: LEACH -> L, E, A, C, H

 We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, N, ... but we know R is excluded. So next are O, T, N, L, etc.

 In LEANT: we have E, A, N, T, L -> that covers T and N and L.
 In HAVEN: we have H, A, V, E, N -> V is less common.
 In LEACH: we have L, E, A, C, H -> C and H are common, but we already have L and E and A.

 I think LEANT is a good choice because it includes T and N which are very common.

 So I'll go with ""LEANT"".

 But wait, we have to make sure that we are not putting a letter in a position that we already know is wrong for that letter? We don't have any information about the positions of A and E except that they are not at 1 and 5 respectively. In LEANT, A is at 3 and E at 2. We haven't tried A at 3 or E at 2, so that's okay.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""LEANT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""ARISE"":
- A is present but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked with `-`).
- R, I, and S are absent (marked with `x`), so they can be excluded from future guesses.

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (not in position 1) and **E** (not in position 5).
- Must avoid R, I, and S entirely.
- Should prioritize common letters to maximize new information (e.g., L, N, T).

The word **LEANT** fits these criteria:
- Places A in position 3 (new position to test).
- Places E in position 2 (new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: L, N, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, I, S).",Guess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x),FAIL

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""ARISE"":
 A: - (present but wrong position)
 R: x (not in the word)
 I: x (not in the word)
 S: x (not in the word)
 E: - (present but wrong position)

 So, from this we know:
 - The word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions we guessed (position 1 and 5 respectively).
 - The word does NOT contain R, I, or S.

 Therefore, we must avoid using R, I, S in our next guess.

 Also, note that A and E are in the word, but not at the beginning or the end (since we had A at position 1 and E at position 5 and they were marked as wrong position).

 We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that uses common letters and avoids the excluded ones.

 Since we know A and E are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Does not contain R, I, S.
 - Contains A and E (but not at position 1 or 5? Actually, they could be at position 1 or 5 but not in the same positions as before? Actually, the feedback says they are present but in the wrong position. So for A, since we put it in position 1 and it's wrong, it cannot be at position 1. Similarly, E cannot be at position 5.

 However, note: the feedback does not necessarily say that the letter cannot be in that position if it appears again? But in this case, we only have one A and one E in the guess. So the word has at least one A (not at position 1) and at least one E (not at position 5).

 We also have three letters that are absent: R, I, S.

 We can try to use other common letters: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E (in positions that are not 1 for A and not 5 for E) and also includes other common letters.

 Possible positions for A: 2, 3, 4, 5? But note: we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. So E is in the word but not at 5. Similarly, A is in the word but not at 1. However, A could be at 5? Yes, because we haven't tried A at 5. Similarly, E could be at 1? But we haven't tried E at 1.

 Actually, we don't know about E at position 1 because we only had it at position 5. Similarly, we don't know about A at positions 2,3,4,5 (except that it's not at 1). But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and E and avoid R, I, S.

 Some ideas: 
 - We could try ""LATEN"" but that's not a word? 
 - How about ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E. 
   - A is at position 3 (which is not 1) and E is at position 5 (but we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E was in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at 5 and A at 1.

 In ""PLATE"":
   A is at position 3 (which is okay, because we haven't tried A at 3 and we know it's not at 1) and E is at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we should avoid that.

 We need to put E in a position that is not 5. And A in a position that is not 1.

 How about ""LEANT""? 
   L, E, A, N, T.
   E is at position 2 (not 5) and A is at position 3 (not 1). Also, no R, I, S.

 But is ""LEANT"" a valid word? Yes, it is (past tense of lean).

 Alternatively, we could try ""OCEAN"", but note that we have O, C, E, A, N. However, we don't know if O, C, or N are in the word. Also, E is at position 3 and A at position 4? And we avoid R,I,S.

 But note: we have two letters we know: A and E. We want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Another idea: ""ADOBE"" -> A at position 1? But we know A cannot be at position 1. So that's invalid for A.

 How about ""BEADY""? 
   B, E, A, D, Y.
   E at position 2 (not 5) and A at position 3 (not 1). And no R,I,S.

 But we don't know if B, D, Y are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and E and also includes other vowels? But we know I is not in the word, so we avoid I.

 Another common word: ""LATER"" -> but R is excluded, so we cannot use R.

 So let's avoid R, I, S.

 I think ""LEANT"" is a good candidate.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 However, in our first guess, we had distinct letters and the feedback didn't show any duplicate marks, so probably the secret word has distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have evidence of duplicates.

 Let's go with ""LEANT"".

 Alternatively, we can use ""TALON"", but that doesn't have E. We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 Another word: ""ALONE"" -> 
   A at position 1: but we know A is not at position 1? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So we cannot put A at position 1. Therefore, ""ALONE"" is invalid because A is at 1.

 How about ""OUNCE""? It has E at the end? But we know E is not at 5? Actually, we don't know if E is at 5? The feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 5. So we must avoid putting E at 5. In ""OUNCE"", E is at 5 -> invalid.

 Another word: ""MANGE"" -> M, A, N, G, E. 
   A at position 2 (okay) and E at position 5 (not okay).

 So we avoid E at 5.

 How about ""AGLET""? But A is at 1 -> invalid.

 How about ""TEPAL""? It's a word? (a type of plant part) 
   T, E, P, A, L -> E at 2, A at 4. This avoids the forbidden positions and letters.

 But we don't know if T, P, L are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLACE"": 
   P, L, A, C, E -> A at 3 (okay) but E at 5 (not okay).

 So we need a word that has E in positions 1,2,3, or 4 and A in positions 2,3,4,5 (but not 1).

 Let me think of words that have A and E and avoid R,I,S, and with A not at 1 and E not at 5.

 Some options:
 - ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> A at 2, E at 4. (valid)
 - ""CAVEM"": not a word.
 - ""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4. (valid)
 - ""DAVIT"": D, A, V, I, T -> but I is excluded -> invalid.

 I think ""HAVEN"" is a good choice. It uses H, V, N which are common.

 But note: we don't know if H, V, N are in the word. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has as many new common letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""CHANT"": but no E -> invalid.

 How about ""LEACH"": L, E, A, C, H -> 
   E at position 2 (okay) and A at position 3 (okay). And no E at 5 and no A at 1.

 But we have to avoid R,I,S and we did.

 So ""LEACH"" is a valid word.

 However, we already have A and E in the word, and we are introducing L, C, H.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: LEANT -> L, E, A, N, T
 Option 2: HAVEN -> H, A, V, E, N
 Option 3: LEACH -> L, E, A, C, H

 We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, N, ... but we know R is excluded. So next are O, T, N, L, etc.

 In LEANT: we have E, A, N, T, L -> that covers T and N and L.
 In HAVEN: we have H, A, V, E, N -> V is less common.
 In LEACH: we have L, E, A, C, H -> C and H are common, but we already have L and E and A.

 I think LEANT is a good choice because it includes T and N which are very common.

 So I'll go with ""LEANT"".

 But wait, we have to make sure that we are not putting a letter in a position that we already know is wrong for that letter? We don't have any information about the positions of A and E except that they are not at 1 and 5 respectively. In LEANT, A is at 3 and E at 2. We haven't tried A at 3 or E at 2, so that's okay.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""LEANT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""ARISE"":

- Places A in position 3 (new position to test).
- Places E in position 2 (new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: L, N, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, I, S).

- A: present but not in position 1 (so A is in the word, but not at index 0)
- R: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present but not in position 5 (so E is in the word, but not at index 4)

Guess 2: LEANT
- L: present but not in position 1 (so L is in the word, but not at index 0)
- E: present but not in position 2 (so E is in the word, but not at index 1)
- A: present but not in position 3 (so A is in the word, but not at index 2)
- N: absent
- T: absent

So, from the feedback we know:

1. The word contains the letters: A, E, L (each at least once).
2. The word does not contain: R, I, S, N, T.
3. Positions:
   - A cannot be at index 0 (from ARISE) and also cannot be at index 2 (from LEANT).
   - E cannot be at index 4 (from ARISE) and also cannot be at index 1 (from LEANT).
   - L cannot be at index 0 (from LEANT).

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes A, E, L (since they are present, but we don't know the exact positions).
- Excludes R, I, S, N, T (since they are absent).
- Avoids placing A at positions 0 or 2, E at positions 1 or 4, and L at position 0.

We have to choose a word that uses only the remaining letters (since we know 5 letters that are absent, and 3 that are present). The remaining letters of the alphabet are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: the word must contain at least A, E, L. So we need to form a 5-letter word that includes these three and two more from the remaining letters, while respecting the position constraints.

Let's list the constraints for each known letter:

- A: must be in the word, but not at position 0 or 2. So possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4 (if we number positions 0 to 4).
- E: must be in the word, but not at position 1 or 4. So possible positions for E: 0, 2, 3.
- L: must be in the word, but not at position 0. So possible positions for L: 1, 2, 3, 4.

We also don't know if there are duplicate letters, but since we haven't encountered any duplicates in feedback, we assume no duplicates for now.

We need to choose a word that satisfies:
- Contains A, E, L and two other letters (from the allowed set: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).
- A is at one of {1,3,4}
- E is at one of {0,2,3}
- L is at one of {1,2,3,4}

We can try to think of common words that fit.

Let me try to list possible words:

Option 1: Place E at position 0. Then E _ _ _ _
But then we have to place A and L in the remaining positions, avoiding their forbidden positions.

If E is at 0, then:
- A can be at 1,3,4 (but not 2)
- L can be at 1,2,3,4 (but not 0, which is taken by E)

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Example: ""E"" at 0, then we need A and L in the next four. Also, we need two more letters.

Possible: E _ A _ _  -> but we have to fill the blanks.

Word: ""EMAIL"" -> but M and A: but A is at 3? E at 0, M at 1, A at 2? But A cannot be at 2! So invalid.

Another: ""EAGLE"" -> but G and L: E at 0, A at 1 (valid for A), G at 2, L at 3, E at 4? But E is at 4? But we know E cannot be at 4. Also, duplicate E? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have G and L. But E at 4 is forbidden.

How about ""EQUAL"" -> E at 0, Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3, L at 4. 
- A at 3: valid (since A can be at 3)
- E at 0: valid (E can be at 0)
- L at 4: valid (L can be at 4)
- Letters: E, Q, U, A, L -> contains A, E, L and Q, U (which are allowed? yes, not in the absent list)

But is ""EQUAL"" a valid word? Yes.

But note: we have to check if we are introducing new letters that might be absent? We don't know about Q and U. We are trying to get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to use more common letters.

Another idea: Place E at position 2. Then _ _ E _ _

Now, we can place A at 1,3,4 and L at 1,3,4 (but not 0, which is open but we don't have to put L there).

For example: _ A E _ _ -> then we need to fill the first and last two.

But A at 1: valid. Then we have positions 0, 3, 4 to fill, with one of them being L and two new letters.

Possible word: ""HALED"" -> H at 0, A at 1, E at 2, L at 3, D at 4? 
But L at 3: valid. 
But we have A at 1: valid, E at 2: valid (since E can be at 2). 
Letters: H, A, L, E, D -> all allowed? H and D are not in the absent list.

But note: we have to check if the word is valid: ""HALED"" is a word (past tense of hale).

But wait: in ""HALED"", we have A at 1 and L at 3. Also, E at 2. So that fits.

Another possibility: Place E at 3. Then _ _ _ E _

Now, A can be at 1,4 (since not 0,2) and L at 1,2,4.

Example: _ _ _ E A -> but A at 4: valid. Then we need to put L in one of the first three, but not at 0? Actually, L can be at 1,2.

Word: ""OPERA"" -> but O, P, E, R, A -> but R is absent! So invalid.

Another: ""UVULA"" -> U, V, U, L, A -> but duplicate U? And we don't know. Also, U and V are allowed. But let's check: 
- E is not in the word? We need E. We have E at position 3? In ""UVULA"", we have no E. So invalid.

We need a word that has E at 3 and A at 4? And L somewhere.

How about ""CAMEL"" -> but C, A, M, E, L -> A at 1? Then E at 3, L at 4. 
But A at 1: valid (since A can be at 1). 
E at 3: valid (E can be at 3). 
L at 4: valid. 
But we have C and M. 
But ""CAMEL"" has 5 letters: C at 0, A at 1, M at 2, E at 3, L at 4. 
But M is not in the absent list? So allowed.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters: R,I,S,N,T. C and M are not in that list, so okay.

But wait: in the feedback for LEANT, we had N and T absent, so we know they are not in the word. So ""CAMEL"" uses C, A, M, E, L -> no N or T, so okay.

But is ""CAMEL"" a valid word? Yes.

Now, we have two candidates: ""EQUAL"" and ""HALED"" and ""CAMEL"".

But we also have to consider that we might want to cover more common letters. Common letters left: O, U, D, H, etc.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions we haven't tested.

We have tested:
- For A: positions 1 (in ARISE) and 3 (in LEANT) -> both were wrong. So we haven't tested A at 4.
- For E: positions 1 (in LEANT) and 5 (in ARISE, which is index 4) -> both wrong. So we haven't tested E at 0 or 2 or 3? Actually, in LEANT, E was at index 1 (which was wrong) and in ARISE at index 4 (wrong). So E can be at 0,2,3.
- For L: we only tested at index 0 (in LEANT) and it was wrong. So L can be at 1,2,3,4.

So we might want to test A at position 4 and E at position 0 or 2 or 3.

In ""EQUAL"": E at 0, A at 3 (which we already tested in LEANT and it was wrong? No, in LEANT, A was at index 2? LEANT: L(0), E(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). So A was at index 2, which was wrong. But in ""EQUAL"", A is at index 3, which we haven't tested. So that's new.

Similarly, in ""HALED"": A at index 1 (which we haven't tested for A? In ARISE, A was at index 0, not 1. So we haven't tested A at 1. And in LEANT, A was at 2. So A at 1 is new.

In ""CAMEL"": A at index 1 (new) and E at index 3 (new) and L at index 4 (new).

But note: we also want to test E at positions we haven't tried. We haven't tried E at 0 or 2 or 3. In ""EQUAL"", E is at 0 (new). In ""HALED"", E is at 2 (new). In ""CAMEL"", E is at 3 (new).

So all are testing new positions.

But we also want to maximize the new letters we test. We have 5 absent letters (R,I,S,N,T) and 3 present (A,E,L). So we have 18 letters left. We want to test as many common ones as possible.

In ""EQUAL"": we test Q and U (less common).
In ""HALED"": we test H and D (common).
In ""CAMEL"": we test C and M (common).

So ""HALED"" and ""CAMEL"" are better for common letters.

But let me see if there is a word that tests even more common letters.

Another idea: Place E at 0 and A at 4? Then E _ _ _ A.

We need to put L in one of 1,2,3 and two more letters.

Example: ""E _ _ L A"" -> then we need to fill the two middle.

Word: ""EXCLA"" -> not a word.

""EJECT"" -> but T is absent.

""EBOOK"" -> not 5 letters? ""EBOOK"" is 5? E,B,O,O,K -> but duplicate O? And we don't know. Also, O and B and K are allowed. But is it a word? Not really, it's usually eBook.

""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> but L is at position 1? Then we have E at 0, L at 1, then B, O, W. But we need A? We don't have A. We must include A.

We need to include A at 4? So ""E _ _ _ A"", and we also need L. So L must be at 1,2, or 3.

Word: ""ELDSA"" -> not a word.

""EMPTA"" -> not a word.

So maybe not.

Another: Place E at 2 and A at 4? Then _ _ E _ A.

We need L at 1,3 (since 0 is open but L cannot be at 0? Actually, L can be at 1,2,3,4. But 2 is taken by E, 4 by A, so L at 1 or 3.

Example: _ L E _ A -> then we need the first and the fourth.

Word: ""OLEMA"" -> not common.

""PLEAD"" -> P, L, E, A, D -> but A is at 3? We have _ _ E _ A, so if we put P at 0, L at 1, E at 2, then we need the fourth to be A? But we have A at 4? So the fourth position is the one before A. So we have: P, L, E, ?, A. So the fourth letter is the one at index 3.

So if we put, say, D at 3: ""PLEDA"" -> not a word.

""BLEAK"" -> B, L, E, A, K -> but A is at 3? We need A at 4. So that would be B, L, E, ?, A -> so the fourth letter (index 3) is missing. If we put A at 4, then index 3 must be filled. ""BLEA"" is 4 letters. We need 5: B, L, E, X, A.

Word: ""BLEAK"" is B, L, E, A, K -> so A is at 3, not 4. So that doesn't fit.

How about ""CLEAN"" -> but N is absent.

""FLEAM"" -> F, L, E, A, M -> A at 3? We need A at 4. So no.

So it's hard to have A at 4 and E at 2.

Now, back to the candidates: ""HALED"", ""CAMEL"", and we can consider ""EQUAL"" but it has uncommon letters.

Another candidate: ""LABEL"" -> but duplicate L? And we don't know. Also, L at 0? But L cannot be at 0. So invalid.

""MAPLE"" -> M, A, P, L, E -> A at 1? Then E at 4? But E cannot be at 4. So invalid.

""TABLE"" -> T is absent.

""GAVEL"" -> G, A, V, E, L -> A at 1? Then E at 3? And L at 4. 
But A at 1: valid (not 0 or 2). 
E at 3: valid (not 1 or 4). 
L at 4: valid (not 0). 
Letters: G, A, V, E, L -> G and V are allowed. 
Word: ""GAVEL"" is valid.

So we have another candidate: ""GAVEL"".

Now, comparing:

- ""HALED"": tests H, A (at 1), L (at 3), E (at 2), D. Positions: H(0), A(1), E(2), L(3), D(4). 
  - A at 1: new position for A.
  - E at 2: new position for E.
  - L at 3: new position for L.

- ""CAMEL"": tests C, A (at 1), M, E (at 3), L (at 4). 
  - A at 1: new.
  - E at 3: new.
  - L at 4: new.

- ""GAVEL"": tests G, A (at 1), V, E (at 3), L (at 4). 
  - A at 1: new.
  - E at 3: new.
  - L at 4: new.

- ""EQUAL"": tests E (at 0), Q, U, A (at 3), L (at 4). 
  - E at 0: new.
  - A at 3: we already tested A at 3 in LEANT? In LEANT, A was at index 2, not 3. So A at 3 is new? Actually, in LEANT, A was at index 2 (position 3 if counting from 1) but we are using 0-indexed: LEANT: index0=L, index1=E, index2=A, index3=N, index4=T. So we tested A at index2 and it was wrong. Now, in ""EQUAL"", A is at index3 (which is new). Similarly, E at index0 is new.

But ""EQUAL"" uses Q and U which are less common, so we might get less information.

I think ""HALED"" is a good choice because it tests E at position 2 (which we haven't tested) and A at 1 (new) and L at 3 (new). Also, it uses H and D, which are common.

Alternatively, ""CAMEL"" and ""GAVEL"" are also good.

But note: in ""HALED"", we are testing the position of E at 2, which is a position we haven't tried for E. Similarly, in ""CAMEL"", we test E at 3.

We have to choose one.

I think I'll go with ""HALED"" because it tests a different position for E (position 2) and we haven't tried that.

So let's choose ""HALED"".

But wait, we must ensure that we are not repeating a position for a letter that we know is wrong? We are not: for A, we haven't tried position 1; for E, we haven't tried position 2; for L, we haven't tried position 3.

So it's safe.

Therefore, the next guess is ""HALED"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **A**, **E**, and **L** are confirmed to be in the word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at 1 or 3, E not at 1 or 5, L not at 1).
- **R**, **I**, **S**, **N**, and **T** are absent and excluded.
- Possible positions for A: 2, 4 (0-indexed positions 1 or 3, since position 0 is also invalid for A from Guess 1).
- Possible positions for E: 1, 3 (0-indexed positions 0 or 2).
- Possible positions for L: 2, 3, 4 (0-indexed positions 1, 2, or 3).

The new guess **HALED**:
- Contains the required letters A, E, L.
- Avoids absent letters (R, I, S, N, T).
- Tests new positions:
  - A at position 2 (0-indexed 1), which hasn't been tried.
  - E at position 3 (0-indexed 2), which hasn't been tried.
  - L at position 4 (0-indexed 3), which hasn't been tried.
- Introduces new common letters (H, D) for additional information.

<guess>HALED</guess>",HALED,"We have the following feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ARISE
- A: present but not in position 1 (so A is in the word, but not at index 0)
- R: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present but not in position 5 (so E is in the word, but not at index 4)

Guess 2: LEANT
- L: present but not in position 1 (so L is in the word, but not at index 0)
- E: present but not in position 2 (so E is in the word, but not at index 1)
- A: present but not in position 3 (so A is in the word, but not at index 2)
- N: absent
- T: absent

So, from the feedback we know:

1. The word contains the letters: A, E, L (each at least once).
2. The word does not contain: R, I, S, N, T.
3. Positions:
   - A cannot be at index 0 (from ARISE) and also cannot be at index 2 (from LEANT).
   - E cannot be at index 4 (from ARISE) and also cannot be at index 1 (from LEANT).
   - L cannot be at index 0 (from LEANT).

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes A, E, L (since they are present, but we don't know the exact positions).
- Excludes R, I, S, N, T (since they are absent).
- Avoids placing A at positions 0 or 2, E at positions 1 or 4, and L at position 0.

We have to choose a word that uses only the remaining letters (since we know 5 letters that are absent, and 3 that are present). The remaining letters of the alphabet are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: the word must contain at least A, E, L. So we need to form a 5-letter word that includes these three and two more from the remaining letters, while respecting the position constraints.

Let's list the constraints for each known letter:

- A: must be in the word, but not at position 0 or 2. So possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4 (if we number positions 0 to 4).
- E: must be in the word, but not at position 1 or 4. So possible positions for E: 0, 2, 3.
- L: must be in the word, but not at position 0. So possible positions for L: 1, 2, 3, 4.

We also don't know if there are duplicate letters, but since we haven't encountered any duplicates in feedback, we assume no duplicates for now.

We need to choose a word that satisfies:
- Contains A, E, L and two other letters (from the allowed set: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).
- A is at one of {1,3,4}
- E is at one of {0,2,3}
- L is at one of {1,2,3,4}

We can try to think of common words that fit.

Let me try to list possible words:

Option 1: Place E at position 0. Then E _ _ _ _
But then we have to place A and L in the remaining positions, avoiding their forbidden positions.

If E is at 0, then:
- A can be at 1,3,4 (but not 2)
- L can be at 1,2,3,4 (but not 0, which is taken by E)

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Example: ""E"" at 0, then we need A and L in the next four. Also, we need two more letters.

Possible: E _ A _ _  -> but we have to fill the blanks.

Word: ""EMAIL"" -> but M and A: but A is at 3? E at 0, M at 1, A at 2? But A cannot be at 2! So invalid.

Another: ""EAGLE"" -> but G and L: E at 0, A at 1 (valid for A), G at 2, L at 3, E at 4? But E is at 4? But we know E cannot be at 4. Also, duplicate E? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have G and L. But E at 4 is forbidden.

How about ""EQUAL"" -> E at 0, Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3, L at 4. 
- A at 3: valid (since A can be at 3)
- E at 0: valid (E can be at 0)
- L at 4: valid (L can be at 4)
- Letters: E, Q, U, A, L -> contains A, E, L and Q, U (which are allowed? yes, not in the absent list)

But is ""EQUAL"" a valid word? Yes.

But note: we have to check if we are introducing new letters that might be absent? We don't know about Q and U. We are trying to get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to use more common letters.

Another idea: Place E at position 2. Then _ _ E _ _

Now, we can place A at 1,3,4 and L at 1,3,4 (but not 0, which is open but we don't have to put L there).

For example: _ A E _ _ -> then we need to fill the first and last two.

But A at 1: valid. Then we have positions 0, 3, 4 to fill, with one of them being L and two new letters.

Possible word: ""HALED"" -> H at 0, A at 1, E at 2, L at 3, D at 4? 
But L at 3: valid. 
But we have A at 1: valid, E at 2: valid (since E can be at 2). 
Letters: H, A, L, E, D -> all allowed? H and D are not in the absent list.

But note: we have to check if the word is valid: ""HALED"" is a word (past tense of hale).

But wait: in ""HALED"", we have A at 1 and L at 3. Also, E at 2. So that fits.

Another possibility: Place E at 3. Then _ _ _ E _

Now, A can be at 1,4 (since not 0,2) and L at 1,2,4.

Example: _ _ _ E A -> but A at 4: valid. Then we need to put L in one of the first three, but not at 0? Actually, L can be at 1,2.

Word: ""OPERA"" -> but O, P, E, R, A -> but R is absent! So invalid.

Another: ""UVULA"" -> U, V, U, L, A -> but duplicate U? And we don't know. Also, U and V are allowed. But let's check: 
- E is not in the word? We need E. We have E at position 3? In ""UVULA"", we have no E. So invalid.

We need a word that has E at 3 and A at 4? And L somewhere.

How about ""CAMEL"" -> but C, A, M, E, L -> A at 1? Then E at 3, L at 4. 
But A at 1: valid (since A can be at 1). 
E at 3: valid (E can be at 3). 
L at 4: valid. 
But we have C and M. 
But ""CAMEL"" has 5 letters: C at 0, A at 1, M at 2, E at 3, L at 4. 
But M is not in the absent list? So allowed.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters: R,I,S,N,T. C and M are not in that list, so okay.

But wait: in the feedback for LEANT, we had N and T absent, so we know they are not in the word. So ""CAMEL"" uses C, A, M, E, L -> no N or T, so okay.

But is ""CAMEL"" a valid word? Yes.

Now, we have two candidates: ""EQUAL"" and ""HALED"" and ""CAMEL"".

But we also have to consider that we might want to cover more common letters. Common letters left: O, U, D, H, etc.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions we haven't tested.

We have tested:
- For A: positions 1 (in ARISE) and 3 (in LEANT) -> both were wrong. So we haven't tested A at 4.
- For E: positions 1 (in LEANT) and 5 (in ARISE, which is index 4) -> both wrong. So we haven't tested E at 0 or 2 or 3? Actually, in LEANT, E was at index 1 (which was wrong) and in ARISE at index 4 (wrong). So E can be at 0,2,3.
- For L: we only tested at index 0 (in LEANT) and it was wrong. So L can be at 1,2,3,4.

So we might want to test A at position 4 and E at position 0 or 2 or 3.

In ""EQUAL"": E at 0, A at 3 (which we already tested in LEANT and it was wrong? No, in LEANT, A was at index 2? LEANT: L(0), E(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). So A was at index 2, which was wrong. But in ""EQUAL"", A is at index 3, which we haven't tested. So that's new.

Similarly, in ""HALED"": A at index 1 (which we haven't tested for A? In ARISE, A was at index 0, not 1. So we haven't tested A at 1. And in LEANT, A was at 2. So A at 1 is new.

In ""CAMEL"": A at index 1 (new) and E at index 3 (new) and L at index 4 (new).

But note: we also want to test E at positions we haven't tried. We haven't tried E at 0 or 2 or 3. In ""EQUAL"", E is at 0 (new). In ""HALED"", E is at 2 (new). In ""CAMEL"", E is at 3 (new).

So all are testing new positions.

But we also want to maximize the new letters we test. We have 5 absent letters (R,I,S,N,T) and 3 present (A,E,L). So we have 18 letters left. We want to test as many common ones as possible.

In ""EQUAL"": we test Q and U (less common).
In ""HALED"": we test H and D (common).
In ""CAMEL"": we test C and M (common).

So ""HALED"" and ""CAMEL"" are better for common letters.

But let me see if there is a word that tests even more common letters.

Another idea: Place E at 0 and A at 4? Then E _ _ _ A.

We need to put L in one of 1,2,3 and two more letters.

Example: ""E _ _ L A"" -> then we need to fill the two middle.

Word: ""EXCLA"" -> not a word.

""EJECT"" -> but T is absent.

""EBOOK"" -> not 5 letters? ""EBOOK"" is 5? E,B,O,O,K -> but duplicate O? And we don't know. Also, O and B and K are allowed. But is it a word? Not really, it's usually eBook.

""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> but L is at position 1? Then we have E at 0, L at 1, then B, O, W. But we need A? We don't have A. We must include A.

We need to include A at 4? So ""E _ _ _ A"", and we also need L. So L must be at 1,2, or 3.

Word: ""ELDSA"" -> not a word.

""EMPTA"" -> not a word.

So maybe not.

Another: Place E at 2 and A at 4? Then _ _ E _ A.

We need L at 1,3 (since 0 is open but L cannot be at 0? Actually, L can be at 1,2,3,4. But 2 is taken by E, 4 by A, so L at 1 or 3.

Example: _ L E _ A -> then we need the first and the fourth.

Word: ""OLEMA"" -> not common.

""PLEAD"" -> P, L, E, A, D -> but A is at 3? We have _ _ E _ A, so if we put P at 0, L at 1, E at 2, then we need the fourth to be A? But we have A at 4? So the fourth position is the one before A. So we have: P, L, E, ?, A. So the fourth letter is the one at index 3.

So if we put, say, D at 3: ""PLEDA"" -> not a word.

""BLEAK"" -> B, L, E, A, K -> but A is at 3? We need A at 4. So that would be B, L, E, ?, A -> so the fourth letter (index 3) is missing. If we put A at 4, then index 3 must be filled. ""BLEA"" is 4 letters. We need 5: B, L, E, X, A.

Word: ""BLEAK"" is B, L, E, A, K -> so A is at 3, not 4. So that doesn't fit.

How about ""CLEAN"" -> but N is absent.

""FLEAM"" -> F, L, E, A, M -> A at 3? We need A at 4. So no.

So it's hard to have A at 4 and E at 2.

Now, back to the candidates: ""HALED"", ""CAMEL"", and we can consider ""EQUAL"" but it has uncommon letters.

Another candidate: ""LABEL"" -> but duplicate L? And we don't know. Also, L at 0? But L cannot be at 0. So invalid.

""MAPLE"" -> M, A, P, L, E -> A at 1? Then E at 4? But E cannot be at 4. So invalid.

""TABLE"" -> T is absent.

""GAVEL"" -> G, A, V, E, L -> A at 1? Then E at 3? And L at 4. 
But A at 1: valid (not 0 or 2). 
E at 3: valid (not 1 or 4). 
L at 4: valid (not 0). 
Letters: G, A, V, E, L -> G and V are allowed. 
Word: ""GAVEL"" is valid.

So we have another candidate: ""GAVEL"".

Now, comparing:

- ""HALED"": tests H, A (at 1), L (at 3), E (at 2), D. Positions: H(0), A(1), E(2), L(3), D(4). 
  - A at 1: new position for A.
  - E at 2: new position for E.
  - L at 3: new position for L.

- ""CAMEL"": tests C, A (at 1), M, E (at 3), L (at 4). 
  - A at 1: new.
  - E at 3: new.
  - L at 4: new.

- ""GAVEL"": tests G, A (at 1), V, E (at 3), L (at 4). 
  - A at 1: new.
  - E at 3: new.
  - L at 4: new.

- ""EQUAL"": tests E (at 0), Q, U, A (at 3), L (at 4). 
  - E at 0: new.
  - A at 3: we already tested A at 3 in LEANT? In LEANT, A was at index 2, not 3. So A at 3 is new? Actually, in LEANT, A was at index 2 (position 3 if counting from 1) but we are using 0-indexed: LEANT: index0=L, index1=E, index2=A, index3=N, index4=T. So we tested A at index2 and it was wrong. Now, in ""EQUAL"", A is at index3 (which is new). Similarly, E at index0 is new.

But ""EQUAL"" uses Q and U which are less common, so we might get less information.

I think ""HALED"" is a good choice because it tests E at position 2 (which we haven't tested) and A at 1 (new) and L at 3 (new). Also, it uses H and D, which are common.

Alternatively, ""CAMEL"" and ""GAVEL"" are also good.

But note: in ""HALED"", we are testing the position of E at 2, which is a position we haven't tried for E. Similarly, in ""CAMEL"", we test E at 3.

We have to choose one.

I think I'll go with ""HALED"" because it tests a different position for E (position 2) and we haven't tried that.

So let's choose ""HALED"".

But wait, we must ensure that we are not repeating a position for a letter that we know is wrong? We are not: for A, we haven't tried position 1; for E, we haven't tried position 2; for L, we haven't tried position 3.

So it's safe.

Therefore, the next guess is ""HALED"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **A**, **E**, and **L** are confirmed to be in the word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at 1 or 3, E not at 1 or 5, L not at 1).
- **R**, **I**, **S**, **N**, and **T** are absent and excluded.
- Possible positions for A: 2, 4 (0-indexed positions 1 or 3, since position 0 is also invalid for A from Guess 1).
- Possible positions for E: 1, 3 (0-indexed positions 0 or 2).
- Possible positions for L: 2, 3, 4 (0-indexed positions 1, 2, or 3).

The new guess **HALED**:
- Contains the required letters A, E, L.
- Avoids absent letters (R, I, S, N, T).
- Tests new positions:
  - A at position 2 (0-indexed 1), which hasn't been tried.
  - E at position 3 (0-indexed 2), which hasn't been tried.
  - L at position 4 (0-indexed 3), which hasn't been tried.
- Introduces new common letters (H, D) for additional information.",Guess 3: HALED -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) L(-) E(✓) D(x),FAIL

<guess>ARISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback on the first guess ""ARISE"":
 A: - (present but wrong position)
 R: x (not in the word)
 I: x (not in the word)
 S: x (not in the word)
 E: - (present but wrong position)

 So, from this we know:
 - The word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions we guessed (position 1 and 5 respectively).
 - The word does NOT contain R, I, or S.

 Therefore, we must avoid using R, I, S in our next guess.

 Also, note that A and E are in the word, but not at the beginning or the end (since we had A at position 1 and E at position 5 and they were marked as wrong position).

 We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that uses common letters and avoids the excluded ones.

 Since we know A and E are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.

 Let's think of a word that:
 - Does not contain R, I, S.
 - Contains A and E (but not at position 1 or 5? Actually, they could be at position 1 or 5 but not in the same positions as before? Actually, the feedback says they are present but in the wrong position. So for A, since we put it in position 1 and it's wrong, it cannot be at position 1. Similarly, E cannot be at position 5.

 However, note: the feedback does not necessarily say that the letter cannot be in that position if it appears again? But in this case, we only have one A and one E in the guess. So the word has at least one A (not at position 1) and at least one E (not at position 5).

 We also have three letters that are absent: R, I, S.

 We can try to use other common letters: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that includes A and E (in positions that are not 1 for A and not 5 for E) and also includes other common letters.

 Possible positions for A: 2, 3, 4, 5? But note: we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. So E is in the word but not at 5. Similarly, A is in the word but not at 1. However, A could be at 5? Yes, because we haven't tried A at 5. Similarly, E could be at 1? But we haven't tried E at 1.

 Actually, we don't know about E at position 1 because we only had it at position 5. Similarly, we don't know about A at positions 2,3,4,5 (except that it's not at 1). But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

 Let's try to think of words that have A and E and avoid R, I, S.

 Some ideas: 
 - We could try ""LATEN"" but that's not a word? 
 - How about ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E. 
   - A is at position 3 (which is not 1) and E is at position 5 (but we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E was in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it's not there. So we should avoid putting E at 5 and A at 1.

 In ""PLATE"":
   A is at position 3 (which is okay, because we haven't tried A at 3 and we know it's not at 1) and E is at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we should avoid that.

 We need to put E in a position that is not 5. And A in a position that is not 1.

 How about ""LEANT""? 
   L, E, A, N, T.
   E is at position 2 (not 5) and A is at position 3 (not 1). Also, no R, I, S.

 But is ""LEANT"" a valid word? Yes, it is (past tense of lean).

 Alternatively, we could try ""OCEAN"", but note that we have O, C, E, A, N. However, we don't know if O, C, or N are in the word. Also, E is at position 3 and A at position 4? And we avoid R,I,S.

 But note: we have two letters we know: A and E. We want to test other common letters to get more information.

 Another idea: ""ADOBE"" -> A at position 1? But we know A cannot be at position 1. So that's invalid for A.

 How about ""BEADY""? 
   B, E, A, D, Y.
   E at position 2 (not 5) and A at position 3 (not 1). And no R,I,S.

 But we don't know if B, D, Y are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and E and also includes other vowels? But we know I is not in the word, so we avoid I.

 Another common word: ""LATER"" -> but R is excluded, so we cannot use R.

 So let's avoid R, I, S.

 I think ""LEANT"" is a good candidate.

 But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn't show any duplicate, but we don't know.

 However, in our first guess, we had distinct letters and the feedback didn't show any duplicate marks, so probably the secret word has distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don't have evidence of duplicates.

 Let's go with ""LEANT"".

 Alternatively, we can use ""TALON"", but that doesn't have E. We must include E because we know it's in the word.

 Another word: ""ALONE"" -> 
   A at position 1: but we know A is not at position 1? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So we cannot put A at position 1. Therefore, ""ALONE"" is invalid because A is at 1.

 How about ""OUNCE""? It has E at the end? But we know E is not at 5? Actually, we don't know if E is at 5? The feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 5. So we must avoid putting E at 5. In ""OUNCE"", E is at 5 -> invalid.

 Another word: ""MANGE"" -> M, A, N, G, E. 
   A at position 2 (okay) and E at position 5 (not okay).

 So we avoid E at 5.

 How about ""AGLET""? But A is at 1 -> invalid.

 How about ""TEPAL""? It's a word? (a type of plant part) 
   T, E, P, A, L -> E at 2, A at 4. This avoids the forbidden positions and letters.

 But we don't know if T, P, L are in the word.

 Alternatively, we can try ""PLACE"": 
   P, L, A, C, E -> A at 3 (okay) but E at 5 (not okay).

 So we need a word that has E in positions 1,2,3, or 4 and A in positions 2,3,4,5 (but not 1).

 Let me think of words that have A and E and avoid R,I,S, and with A not at 1 and E not at 5.

 Some options:
 - ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> A at 2, E at 4. (valid)
 - ""CAVEM"": not a word.
 - ""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4. (valid)
 - ""DAVIT"": D, A, V, I, T -> but I is excluded -> invalid.

 I think ""HAVEN"" is a good choice. It uses H, V, N which are common.

 But note: we don't know if H, V, N are in the word. We are trying to get more information.

 Alternatively, we can use a word that has as many new common letters as possible.

 Another idea: ""CHANT"": but no E -> invalid.

 How about ""LEACH"": L, E, A, C, H -> 
   E at position 2 (okay) and A at position 3 (okay). And no E at 5 and no A at 1.

 But we have to avoid R,I,S and we did.

 So ""LEACH"" is a valid word.

 However, we already have A and E in the word, and we are introducing L, C, H.

 Let me compare:

 Option 1: LEANT -> L, E, A, N, T
 Option 2: HAVEN -> H, A, V, E, N
 Option 3: LEACH -> L, E, A, C, H

 We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, N, ... but we know R is excluded. So next are O, T, N, L, etc.

 In LEANT: we have E, A, N, T, L -> that covers T and N and L.
 In HAVEN: we have H, A, V, E, N -> V is less common.
 In LEACH: we have L, E, A, C, H -> C and H are common, but we already have L and E and A.

 I think LEANT is a good choice because it includes T and N which are very common.

 So I'll go with ""LEANT"".

 But wait, we have to make sure that we are not putting a letter in a position that we already know is wrong for that letter? We don't have any information about the positions of A and E except that they are not at 1 and 5 respectively. In LEANT, A is at 3 and E at 2. We haven't tried A at 3 or E at 2, so that's okay.

 Therefore, my next guess is ""LEANT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""ARISE"":
- A is present but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).
- E is present but not in position 5 (marked with `-`).
- R, I, and S are absent (marked with `x`), so they can be excluded from future guesses.

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** (not in position 1) and **E** (not in position 5).
- Must avoid R, I, and S entirely.
- Should prioritize common letters to maximize new information (e.g., L, N, T).

The word **LEANT** fits these criteria:
- Places A in position 3 (new position to test).
- Places E in position 2 (new position to test).
- Introduces new common letters: L, N, T.
- Avoids forbidden letters (R, I, S).

<guess>LEANT</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ARISE
- A: present but not in position 1 (so A is in the word, but not at index 0)
- R: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present but not in position 5 (so E is in the word, but not at index 4)

Guess 2: LEANT
- L: present but not in position 1 (so L is in the word, but not at index 0)
- E: present but not in position 2 (so E is in the word, but not at index 1)
- A: present but not in position 3 (so A is in the word, but not at index 2)
- N: absent
- T: absent

So, from the feedback we know:

1. The word contains the letters: A, E, L (each at least once).
2. The word does not contain: R, I, S, N, T.
3. Positions:
   - A cannot be at index 0 (from ARISE) and also cannot be at index 2 (from LEANT).
   - E cannot be at index 4 (from ARISE) and also cannot be at index 1 (from LEANT).
   - L cannot be at index 0 (from LEANT).

We also know that the word is 5 letters long.

We need to make a new guess that:
- Includes A, E, L (since they are present, but we don't know the exact positions).
- Excludes R, I, S, N, T (since they are absent).
- Avoids placing A at positions 0 or 2, E at positions 1 or 4, and L at position 0.

We have to choose a word that uses only the remaining letters (since we know 5 letters that are absent, and 3 that are present). The remaining letters of the alphabet are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: the word must contain at least A, E, L. So we need to form a 5-letter word that includes these three and two more from the remaining letters, while respecting the position constraints.

Let's list the constraints for each known letter:

- A: must be in the word, but not at position 0 or 2. So possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4 (if we number positions 0 to 4).
- E: must be in the word, but not at position 1 or 4. So possible positions for E: 0, 2, 3.
- L: must be in the word, but not at position 0. So possible positions for L: 1, 2, 3, 4.

We also don't know if there are duplicate letters, but since we haven't encountered any duplicates in feedback, we assume no duplicates for now.

We need to choose a word that satisfies:
- Contains A, E, L and two other letters (from the allowed set: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).
- A is at one of {1,3,4}
- E is at one of {0,2,3}
- L is at one of {1,2,3,4}

We can try to think of common words that fit.

Let me try to list possible words:

Option 1: Place E at position 0. Then E _ _ _ _
But then we have to place A and L in the remaining positions, avoiding their forbidden positions.

If E is at 0, then:
- A can be at 1,3,4 (but not 2)
- L can be at 1,2,3,4 (but not 0, which is taken by E)

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.

Example: ""E"" at 0, then we need A and L in the next four. Also, we need two more letters.

Possible: E _ A _ _  -> but we have to fill the blanks.

Word: ""EMAIL"" -> but M and A: but A is at 3? E at 0, M at 1, A at 2? But A cannot be at 2! So invalid.

Another: ""EAGLE"" -> but G and L: E at 0, A at 1 (valid for A), G at 2, L at 3, E at 4? But E is at 4? But we know E cannot be at 4. Also, duplicate E? And we don't know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have G and L. But E at 4 is forbidden.

How about ""EQUAL"" -> E at 0, Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3, L at 4. 
- A at 3: valid (since A can be at 3)
- E at 0: valid (E can be at 0)
- L at 4: valid (L can be at 4)
- Letters: E, Q, U, A, L -> contains A, E, L and Q, U (which are allowed? yes, not in the absent list)

But is ""EQUAL"" a valid word? Yes.

But note: we have to check if we are introducing new letters that might be absent? We don't know about Q and U. We are trying to get more information.

Alternatively, we can try to use more common letters.

Another idea: Place E at position 2. Then _ _ E _ _

Now, we can place A at 1,3,4 and L at 1,3,4 (but not 0, which is open but we don't have to put L there).

For example: _ A E _ _ -> then we need to fill the first and last two.

But A at 1: valid. Then we have positions 0, 3, 4 to fill, with one of them being L and two new letters.

Possible word: ""HALED"" -> H at 0, A at 1, E at 2, L at 3, D at 4? 
But L at 3: valid. 
But we have A at 1: valid, E at 2: valid (since E can be at 2). 
Letters: H, A, L, E, D -> all allowed? H and D are not in the absent list.

But note: we have to check if the word is valid: ""HALED"" is a word (past tense of hale).

But wait: in ""HALED"", we have A at 1 and L at 3. Also, E at 2. So that fits.

Another possibility: Place E at 3. Then _ _ _ E _

Now, A can be at 1,4 (since not 0,2) and L at 1,2,4.

Example: _ _ _ E A -> but A at 4: valid. Then we need to put L in one of the first three, but not at 0? Actually, L can be at 1,2.

Word: ""OPERA"" -> but O, P, E, R, A -> but R is absent! So invalid.

Another: ""UVULA"" -> U, V, U, L, A -> but duplicate U? And we don't know. Also, U and V are allowed. But let's check: 
- E is not in the word? We need E. We have E at position 3? In ""UVULA"", we have no E. So invalid.

We need a word that has E at 3 and A at 4? And L somewhere.

How about ""CAMEL"" -> but C, A, M, E, L -> A at 1? Then E at 3, L at 4. 
But A at 1: valid (since A can be at 1). 
E at 3: valid (E can be at 3). 
L at 4: valid. 
But we have C and M. 
But ""CAMEL"" has 5 letters: C at 0, A at 1, M at 2, E at 3, L at 4. 
But M is not in the absent list? So allowed.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters: R,I,S,N,T. C and M are not in that list, so okay.

But wait: in the feedback for LEANT, we had N and T absent, so we know they are not in the word. So ""CAMEL"" uses C, A, M, E, L -> no N or T, so okay.

But is ""CAMEL"" a valid word? Yes.

Now, we have two candidates: ""EQUAL"" and ""HALED"" and ""CAMEL"".

But we also have to consider that we might want to cover more common letters. Common letters left: O, U, D, H, etc.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions we haven't tested.

We have tested:
- For A: positions 1 (in ARISE) and 3 (in LEANT) -> both were wrong. So we haven't tested A at 4.
- For E: positions 1 (in LEANT) and 5 (in ARISE, which is index 4) -> both wrong. So we haven't tested E at 0 or 2 or 3? Actually, in LEANT, E was at index 1 (which was wrong) and in ARISE at index 4 (wrong). So E can be at 0,2,3.
- For L: we only tested at index 0 (in LEANT) and it was wrong. So L can be at 1,2,3,4.

So we might want to test A at position 4 and E at position 0 or 2 or 3.

In ""EQUAL"": E at 0, A at 3 (which we already tested in LEANT and it was wrong? No, in LEANT, A was at index 2? LEANT: L(0), E(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). So A was at index 2, which was wrong. But in ""EQUAL"", A is at index 3, which we haven't tested. So that's new.

Similarly, in ""HALED"": A at index 1 (which we haven't tested for A? In ARISE, A was at index 0, not 1. So we haven't tested A at 1. And in LEANT, A was at 2. So A at 1 is new.

In ""CAMEL"": A at index 1 (new) and E at index 3 (new) and L at index 4 (new).

But note: we also want to test E at positions we haven't tried. We haven't tried E at 0 or 2 or 3. In ""EQUAL"", E is at 0 (new). In ""HALED"", E is at 2 (new). In ""CAMEL"", E is at 3 (new).

So all are testing new positions.

But we also want to maximize the new letters we test. We have 5 absent letters (R,I,S,N,T) and 3 present (A,E,L). So we have 18 letters left. We want to test as many common ones as possible.

In ""EQUAL"": we test Q and U (less common).
In ""HALED"": we test H and D (common).
In ""CAMEL"": we test C and M (common).

So ""HALED"" and ""CAMEL"" are better for common letters.

But let me see if there is a word that tests even more common letters.

Another idea: Place E at 0 and A at 4? Then E _ _ _ A.

We need to put L in one of 1,2,3 and two more letters.

Example: ""E _ _ L A"" -> then we need to fill the two middle.

Word: ""EXCLA"" -> not a word.

""EJECT"" -> but T is absent.

""EBOOK"" -> not 5 letters? ""EBOOK"" is 5? E,B,O,O,K -> but duplicate O? And we don't know. Also, O and B and K are allowed. But is it a word? Not really, it's usually eBook.

""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> but L is at position 1? Then we have E at 0, L at 1, then B, O, W. But we need A? We don't have A. We must include A.

We need to include A at 4? So ""E _ _ _ A"", and we also need L. So L must be at 1,2, or 3.

Word: ""ELDSA"" -> not a word.

""EMPTA"" -> not a word.

So maybe not.

Another: Place E at 2 and A at 4? Then _ _ E _ A.

We need L at 1,3 (since 0 is open but L cannot be at 0? Actually, L can be at 1,2,3,4. But 2 is taken by E, 4 by A, so L at 1 or 3.

Example: _ L E _ A -> then we need the first and the fourth.

Word: ""OLEMA"" -> not common.

""PLEAD"" -> P, L, E, A, D -> but A is at 3? We have _ _ E _ A, so if we put P at 0, L at 1, E at 2, then we need the fourth to be A? But we have A at 4? So the fourth position is the one before A. So we have: P, L, E, ?, A. So the fourth letter is the one at index 3.

So if we put, say, D at 3: ""PLEDA"" -> not a word.

""BLEAK"" -> B, L, E, A, K -> but A is at 3? We need A at 4. So that would be B, L, E, ?, A -> so the fourth letter (index 3) is missing. If we put A at 4, then index 3 must be filled. ""BLEA"" is 4 letters. We need 5: B, L, E, X, A.

Word: ""BLEAK"" is B, L, E, A, K -> so A is at 3, not 4. So that doesn't fit.

How about ""CLEAN"" -> but N is absent.

""FLEAM"" -> F, L, E, A, M -> A at 3? We need A at 4. So no.

So it's hard to have A at 4 and E at 2.

Now, back to the candidates: ""HALED"", ""CAMEL"", and we can consider ""EQUAL"" but it has uncommon letters.

Another candidate: ""LABEL"" -> but duplicate L? And we don't know. Also, L at 0? But L cannot be at 0. So invalid.

""MAPLE"" -> M, A, P, L, E -> A at 1? Then E at 4? But E cannot be at 4. So invalid.

""TABLE"" -> T is absent.

""GAVEL"" -> G, A, V, E, L -> A at 1? Then E at 3? And L at 4. 
But A at 1: valid (not 0 or 2). 
E at 3: valid (not 1 or 4). 
L at 4: valid (not 0). 
Letters: G, A, V, E, L -> G and V are allowed. 
Word: ""GAVEL"" is valid.

So we have another candidate: ""GAVEL"".

Now, comparing:

- ""HALED"": tests H, A (at 1), L (at 3), E (at 2), D. Positions: H(0), A(1), E(2), L(3), D(4). 
  - A at 1: new position for A.
  - E at 2: new position for E.
  - L at 3: new position for L.

- ""CAMEL"": tests C, A (at 1), M, E (at 3), L (at 4). 
  - A at 1: new.
  - E at 3: new.
  - L at 4: new.

- ""GAVEL"": tests G, A (at 1), V, E (at 3), L (at 4). 
  - A at 1: new.
  - E at 3: new.
  - L at 4: new.

- ""EQUAL"": tests E (at 0), Q, U, A (at 3), L (at 4). 
  - E at 0: new.
  - A at 3: we already tested A at 3 in LEANT? In LEANT, A was at index 2, not 3. So A at 3 is new? Actually, in LEANT, A was at index 2 (position 3 if counting from 1) but we are using 0-indexed: LEANT: index0=L, index1=E, index2=A, index3=N, index4=T. So we tested A at index2 and it was wrong. Now, in ""EQUAL"", A is at index3 (which is new). Similarly, E at index0 is new.

But ""EQUAL"" uses Q and U which are less common, so we might get less information.

I think ""HALED"" is a good choice because it tests E at position 2 (which we haven't tested) and A at 1 (new) and L at 3 (new). Also, it uses H and D, which are common.

Alternatively, ""CAMEL"" and ""GAVEL"" are also good.

But note: in ""HALED"", we are testing the position of E at 2, which is a position we haven't tried for E. Similarly, in ""CAMEL"", we test E at 3.

We have to choose one.

I think I'll go with ""HALED"" because it tests a different position for E (position 2) and we haven't tried that.

So let's choose ""HALED"".

But wait, we must ensure that we are not repeating a position for a letter that we know is wrong? We are not: for A, we haven't tried position 1; for E, we haven't tried position 2; for L, we haven't tried position 3.

So it's safe.

Therefore, the next guess is ""HALED"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **A**, **E**, and **L** are confirmed to be in the word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at 1 or 3, E not at 1 or 5, L not at 1).
- **R**, **I**, **S**, **N**, and **T** are absent and excluded.
- Possible positions for A: 2, 4 (0-indexed positions 1 or 3, since position 0 is also invalid for A from Guess 1).
- Possible positions for E: 1, 3 (0-indexed positions 0 or 2).
- Possible positions for L: 2, 3, 4 (0-indexed positions 1, 2, or 3).

The new guess **HALED**:
- Contains the required letters A, E, L.
- Avoids absent letters (R, I, S, N, T).
- Tests new positions:
  - A at position 2 (0-indexed 1), which hasn't been tried.
  - E at position 3 (0-indexed 2), which hasn't been tried.
  - L at position 4 (0-indexed 3), which hasn't been tried.
- Introduces new common letters (H, D) for additional information.

Since I don\'t have any feedback yet, I should choose a word that is common and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. This might help me get useful feedback for narrowing down the secret word.\n\nCommon first guesses in word games like Wordle often include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""RAISE"". These words use frequent letters and cover multiple vowels.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, some strategies aim to use words that include letters that appear often in English words. For example, vowels like A, E, I, O, U are important, and common consonants like R, S, T, L, N.\n\nLooking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. So, for an optimal first guess, I should include several of these high-frequency letters.\n\nA popular starting word is ""ARISE"" because it contains common letters: A, R, I, S, E. That covers vowels and frequent consonants.\n\nAnother good one is ""CRATE"" with C, R, A, T, E.\n\nOr ""SALET"" – but I think ""SALET"" is less common; I should stick with familiar words.\n\n""ROATE"" is another option, but ""RAISE"" seems solid.\n\nFor my first guess, I\'ll go with ""ARISE"".

To maximize information gain, I should choose a word that includes common vowels and consonants based on English letter frequency. Common starting words in similar games include ""ARISE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"", or ""SLATE"", as they cover frequent letters like A, E, I, O, R, S, T, and N.\n\nAmong these, ""ARISE"" is a strong choice because:\n- It contains three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S).\n- Vowels A, E, and I are among the most frequently used letters.\n- Consonants R and S are also high-frequency, which increases the chance of getting useful feedback (correct positions or presence).\n- The word is familiar and valid in English.\n\nAfter this guess, the feedback will indicate which letters are correct (✓), misplaced (-), or absent (x), helping me narrow down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll start with ""ARISE"".\n</think>\n\n<guess>ARISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback on the first guess ""ARISE"":\n A: - (present but wrong position)\n R: x (not in the word)\n I: x (not in the word)\n S: x (not in the word)\n E: - (present but wrong position)\n\n So, from this we know:\n - The word contains the letters A and E, but not in the positions we guessed (position 1 and 5 respectively).\n - The word does NOT contain R, I, or S.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid using R, I, S in our next guess.\n\n Also, note that A and E are in the word, but not at the beginning or the end (since we had A at position 1 and E at position 5 and they were marked as wrong position).\n\n We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that uses common letters and avoids the excluded ones.\n\n Since we know A and E are in the word, we can try to place them in different positions.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that:\n - Does not contain R, I, S.\n - Contains A and E (but not at position 1 or 5? Actually, they could be at position 1 or 5 but not in the same positions as before? Actually, the feedback says they are present but in the wrong position. So for A, since we put it in position 1 and it\'s wrong, it cannot be at position 1. Similarly, E cannot be at position 5.\n\n However, note: the feedback does not necessarily say that the letter cannot be in that position if it appears again? But in this case, we only have one A and one E in the guess. So the word has at least one A (not at position 1) and at least one E (not at position 5).\n\n We also have three letters that are absent: R, I, S.\n\n We can try to use other common letters: T, N, O, L, C, U, D, M, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that includes A and E (in positions that are not 1 for A and not 5 for E) and also includes other common letters.\n\n Possible positions for A: 2, 3, 4, 5? But note: we had E at position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong. So E is in the word but not at 5. Similarly, A is in the word but not at 1. However, A could be at 5? Yes, because we haven\'t tried A at 5. Similarly, E could be at 1? But we haven\'t tried E at 1.\n\n Actually, we don\'t know about E at position 1 because we only had it at position 5. Similarly, we don\'t know about A at positions 2,3,4,5 (except that it\'s not at 1). But note: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that have A and E and avoid R, I, S.\n\n Some ideas: \n - We could try ""LATEN"" but that\'s not a word? \n - How about ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E. \n   - A is at position 3 (which is not 1) and E is at position 5 (but we know E is not at 5? Actually, the feedback said E was in the word but not at position 5. So we cannot put E at 5 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we know it\'s not there. So we should avoid putting E at 5 and A at 1.\n\n In ""PLATE"":\n   A is at position 3 (which is okay, because we haven\'t tried A at 3 and we know it\'s not at 1) and E is at position 5 (which we know is wrong). So we should avoid that.\n\n We need to put E in a position that is not 5. And A in a position that is not 1.\n\n How about ""LEANT""? \n   L, E, A, N, T.\n   E is at position 2 (not 5) and A is at position 3 (not 1). Also, no R, I, S.\n\n But is ""LEANT"" a valid word? Yes, it is (past tense of lean).\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""OCEAN"", but note that we have O, C, E, A, N. However, we don\'t know if O, C, or N are in the word. Also, E is at position 3 and A at position 4? And we avoid R,I,S.\n\n But note: we have two letters we know: A and E. We want to test other common letters to get more information.\n\n Another idea: ""ADOBE"" -> A at position 1? But we know A cannot be at position 1. So that\'s invalid for A.\n\n How about ""BEADY""? \n   B, E, A, D, Y.\n   E at position 2 (not 5) and A at position 3 (not 1). And no R,I,S.\n\n But we don\'t know if B, D, Y are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has A and E and also includes other vowels? But we know I is not in the word, so we avoid I.\n\n Another common word: ""LATER"" -> but R is excluded, so we cannot use R.\n\n So let\'s avoid R, I, S.\n\n I think ""LEANT"" is a good candidate.\n\n But note: we have to consider that the word might have duplicate letters? The feedback didn\'t show any duplicate, but we don\'t know.\n\n However, in our first guess, we had distinct letters and the feedback didn\'t show any duplicate marks, so probably the secret word has distinct letters? Not necessarily, but we don\'t have evidence of duplicates.\n\n Let\'s go with ""LEANT"".\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""TALON"", but that doesn\'t have E. We must include E because we know it\'s in the word.\n\n Another word: ""ALONE"" -> \n   A at position 1: but we know A is not at position 1? Actually, the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 1. So we cannot put A at position 1. Therefore, ""ALONE"" is invalid because A is at 1.\n\n How about ""OUNCE""? It has E at the end? But we know E is not at 5? Actually, we don\'t know if E is at 5? The feedback for E was that it is in the word but not at position 5. So we must avoid putting E at 5. In ""OUNCE"", E is at 5 -> invalid.\n\n Another word: ""MANGE"" -> M, A, N, G, E. \n   A at position 2 (okay) and E at position 5 (not okay).\n\n So we avoid E at 5.\n\n How about ""AGLET""? But A is at 1 -> invalid.\n\n How about ""TEPAL""? It\'s a word? (a type of plant part) \n   T, E, P, A, L -> E at 2, A at 4. This avoids the forbidden positions and letters.\n\n But we don\'t know if T, P, L are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""PLACE"": \n   P, L, A, C, E -> A at 3 (okay) but E at 5 (not okay).\n\n So we need a word that has E in positions 1,2,3, or 4 and A in positions 2,3,4,5 (but not 1).\n\n Let me think of words that have A and E and avoid R,I,S, and with A not at 1 and E not at 5.\n\n Some options:\n - ""HAVEN"": H, A, V, E, N -> A at 2, E at 4. (valid)\n - ""CAVEM"": not a word.\n - ""WAVED"": W, A, V, E, D -> A at 2, E at 4. (valid)\n - ""DAVIT"": D, A, V, I, T -> but I is excluded -> invalid.\n\n I think ""HAVEN"" is a good choice. It uses H, V, N which are common.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if H, V, N are in the word. We are trying to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we can use a word that has as many new common letters as possible.\n\n Another idea: ""CHANT"": but no E -> invalid.\n\n How about ""LEACH"": L, E, A, C, H -> \n   E at position 2 (okay) and A at position 3 (okay). And no E at 5 and no A at 1.\n\n But we have to avoid R,I,S and we did.\n\n So ""LEACH"" is a valid word.\n\n However, we already have A and E in the word, and we are introducing L, C, H.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n Option 1: LEANT -> L, E, A, N, T\n Option 2: HAVEN -> H, A, V, E, N\n Option 3: LEACH -> L, E, A, C, H\n\n We want to cover more common letters. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, N, ... but we know R is excluded. So next are O, T, N, L, etc.\n\n In LEANT: we have E, A, N, T, L -> that covers T and N and L.\n In HAVEN: we have H, A, V, E, N -> V is less common.\n In LEACH: we have L, E, A, C, H -> C and H are common, but we already have L and E and A.\n\n I think LEANT is a good choice because it includes T and N which are very common.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""LEANT"".\n\n But wait, we have to make sure that we are not putting a letter in a position that we already know is wrong for that letter? We don\'t have any information about the positions of A and E except that they are not at 1 and 5 respectively. In LEANT, A is at 3 and E at 2. We haven\'t tried A at 3 or E at 2, so that\'s okay.\n\n Therefore, my next guess is ""LEANT"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""ARISE"":\n- A is present but not in position 1 (marked with `-`).\n- E is present but not in position 5 (marked with `-`).\n- R, I, and S are absent (marked with `x`), so they can be excluded from future guesses.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** (not in position 1) and **E** (not in position 5).\n- Must avoid R, I, and S entirely.\n- Should prioritize common letters to maximize new information (e.g., L, N, T).\n\nThe word **LEANT** fits these criteria:\n- Places A in position 3 (new position to test).\n- Places E in position 2 (new position to test).\n- Introduces new common letters: L, N, T.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (R, I, S).\n\n<guess>LEANT</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ARISE\n- A: present but not in position 1 (so A is in the word, but not at index 0)\n- R: absent\n- I: absent\n- S: absent\n- E: present but not in position 5 (so E is in the word, but not at index 4)\n\nGuess 2: LEANT\n- L: present but not in position 1 (so L is in the word, but not at index 0)\n- E: present but not in position 2 (so E is in the word, but not at index 1)\n- A: present but not in position 3 (so A is in the word, but not at index 2)\n- N: absent\n- T: absent\n\nSo, from the feedback we know:\n\n1.

The remaining letters of the alphabet are: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: the word must contain at least A, E, L. So we need to form a 5-letter word that includes these three and two more from the remaining letters, while respecting the position constraints.\n\nLet\'s list the constraints for each known letter:\n\n- A: must be in the word, but not at position 0 or 2. So possible positions for A: 1, 3, 4 (if we number positions 0 to 4).\n- E: must be in the word, but not at position 1 or 4. So possible positions for E: 0, 2, 3.\n- L: must be in the word, but not at position 0. So possible positions for L: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nWe also don\'t know if there are duplicate letters, but since we haven\'t encountered any duplicates in feedback, we assume no duplicates for now.\n\nWe need to choose a word that satisfies:\n- Contains A, E, L and two other letters (from the allowed set: B,C,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,O,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z).\n- A is at one of {1,3,4}\n- E is at one of {0,2,3}\n- L is at one of {1,2,3,4}\n\nWe can try to think of common words that fit.\n\nLet me try to list possible words:\n\nOption 1: Place E at position 0. Then E _ _ _ _\nBut then we have to place A and L in the remaining positions, avoiding their forbidden positions.\n\nIf E is at 0, then:\n- A can be at 1,3,4 (but not 2)\n- L can be at 1,2,3,4 (but not 0, which is taken by E)\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters.\n\nExample: ""E"" at 0, then we need A and L in the next four. Also, we need two more letters.\n\nPossible: E _ A _ _  -> but we have to fill the blanks.\n\nWord: ""EMAIL"" -> but M and A: but A is at 3? E at 0, M at 1, A at 2? But A cannot be at 2!

And we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed. Also, we have G and L. But E at 4 is forbidden.\n\nHow about ""EQUAL"" -> E at 0, Q at 1, U at 2, A at 3, L at 4. \n- A at 3: valid (since A can be at 3)\n- E at 0: valid (E can be at 0)\n- L at 4: valid (L can be at 4)\n- Letters: E, Q, U, A, L -> contains A, E, L and Q, U (which are allowed? yes, not in the absent list)\n\nBut is ""EQUAL"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut note: we have to check if we are introducing new letters that might be absent? We don\'t know about Q and U. We are trying to get more information.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: Place E at position 2. Then _ _ E _ _\n\nNow, we can place A at 1,3,4 and L at 1,3,4 (but not 0, which is open but we don\'t have to put L there).\n\nFor example: _ A E _ _ -> then we need to fill the first and last two.\n\nBut A at 1: valid. Then we have positions 0, 3, 4 to fill, with one of them being L and two new letters.\n\nPossible word: ""HALED"" -> H at 0, A at 1, E at 2, L at 3, D at 4? \nBut L at 3: valid. \nBut we have A at 1: valid, E at 2: valid (since E can be at 2). \nLetters: H, A, L, E, D -> all allowed? H and D are not in the absent list.\n\nBut note: we have to check if the word is valid: ""HALED"" is a word (past tense of hale).\n\nBut wait: in ""HALED"", we have A at 1 and L at 3. Also, E at 2. So that fits.\n\nAnother possibility: Place E at 3. Then _ _ _ E _\n\nNow, A can be at 1,4 (since not 0,2) and L at 1,2,4.\n\nExample: _ _ _ E A -> but A at 4: valid. Then we need to put L in one of the first three, but not at 0? Actually, L can be at 1,2.\n\nWord: ""OPERA"" -> but O, P, E, R, A -> but R is absent! So invalid.\n\nAnother: ""UVULA"" -> U, V, U, L, A -> but duplicate U? And we don\'t know. Also, U and V are allowed. But let\'s check: \n- E is not in the word? We need E. We have E at position 3? In ""UVULA"", we have no E. So invalid.\n\nWe need a word that has E at 3 and A at 4? And L somewhere.\n\nHow about ""CAMEL"" -> but C, A, M, E, L -> A at 1? Then E at 3, L at 4. \nBut A at 1: valid (since A can be at 1). \nE at 3: valid (E can be at 3). \nL at 4: valid. \nBut we have C and M. \nBut ""CAMEL"" has 5 letters: C at 0, A at 1, M at 2, E at 3, L at 4. \nBut M is not in the absent list? So allowed.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters: R,I,S,N,T. C and M are not in that list, so okay.\n\nBut wait: in the feedback for LEANT, we had N and T absent, so we know they are not in the word. So ""CAMEL"" uses C, A, M, E, L -> no N or T, so okay.\n\nBut is ""CAMEL"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nNow, we have two candidates: ""EQUAL"" and ""HALED"" and ""CAMEL"".\n\nBut we also have to consider that we might want to cover more common letters. Common letters left: O, U, D, H, etc.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has the known letters in positions we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe have tested:\n- For A: positions 1 (in ARISE) and 3 (in LEANT) -> both were wrong. So we haven\'t tested A at 4.\n- For E: positions 1 (in LEANT) and 5 (in ARISE, which is index 4) -> both wrong. So we haven\'t tested E at 0 or 2 or 3? Actually, in LEANT, E was at index 1 (which was wrong) and in ARISE at index 4 (wrong). So E can be at 0,2,3.\n- For L: we only tested at index 0 (in LEANT) and it was wrong. So L can be at 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo we might want to test A at position 4 and E at position 0 or 2 or 3.\n\nIn ""EQUAL"": E at 0, A at 3 (which we already tested in LEANT and it was wrong? No, in LEANT, A was at index 2? LEANT: L(0), E(1), A(2), N(3), T(4). So A was at index 2, which was wrong. But in ""EQUAL"", A is at index 3, which we haven\'t tested. So that\'s new.\n\nSimilarly, in ""HALED"": A at index 1 (which we haven\'t tested for A? In ARISE, A was at index 0, not 1. So we haven\'t tested A at 1. And in LEANT, A was at 2. So A at 1 is new.\n\nIn ""CAMEL"": A at index 1 (new) and E at index 3 (new) and L at index 4 (new).\n\nBut note: we also want to test E at positions we haven\'t tried. We haven\'t tried E at 0 or 2 or 3. In ""EQUAL"", E is at 0 (new). In ""HALED"", E is at 2 (new). In ""CAMEL"", E is at 3 (new).\n\nSo all are testing new positions.\n\nBut we also want to maximize the new letters we test. We have 5 absent letters (R,I,S,N,T) and 3 present (A,E,L). So we have 18 letters left. We want to test as many common ones as possible.\n\nIn ""EQUAL"": we test Q and U (less common).\nIn ""HALED"": we test H and D (common).\nIn ""CAMEL"": we test C and M (common).\n\nSo ""HALED"" and ""CAMEL"" are better for common letters.\n\nBut let me see if there is a word that tests even more common letters.\n\nAnother idea: Place E at 0 and A at 4? Then E _ _ _ A.\n\nWe need to put L in one of 1,2,3 and two more letters.\n\nExample: ""E _ _ L A"" -> then we need to fill the two middle.\n\nWord: ""EXCLA"" -> not a word.\n\n""EJECT"" -> but T is absent.\n\n""EBOOK"" -> not 5 letters? ""EBOOK"" is 5? E,B,O,O,K -> but duplicate O? And we don\'t know. Also, O and B and K are allowed. But is it a word? Not really, it\'s usually eBook.\n\n""ELBOW"" -> E, L, B, O, W -> but L is at position 1? Then we have E at 0, L at 1, then B, O, W. But we need A? We don\'t have A. We must include A.\n\nWe need to include A at 4? So ""E _ _ _ A"", and we also need L. So L must be at 1,2, or 3.\n\nWord: ""ELDSA"" -> not a word.\n\n""EMPTA"" -> not a word.\n\nSo maybe not.\n\nAnother: Place E at 2 and A at 4? Then _ _ E _ A.\n\nWe need L at 1,3 (since 0 is open but L cannot be at 0? Actually, L can be at 1,2,3,4. But 2 is taken by E, 4 by A, so L at 1 or 3.\n\nExample: _ L E _ A -> then we need the first and the fourth.\n\nWord: ""OLEMA"" -> not common.\n\n""PLEAD"" -> P, L, E, A, D -> but A is at 3? We have _ _ E _ A, so if we put P at 0, L at 1, E at 2, then we need the fourth to be A? But we have A at 4? So the fourth position is the one before A. So we have: P, L, E, ?, A. So the fourth letter is the one at index 3.\n\nSo if we put, say, D at 3: ""PLEDA"" -> not a word.\n\n""BLEAK"" -> B, L, E, A, K -> but A is at 3? We need A at 4. So that would be B, L, E, ?, A -> so the fourth letter (index 3) is missing. If we put A at 4, then index 3 must be filled. ""BLEA"" is 4 letters. We need 5: B, L, E, X, A.\n\nWord: ""BLEAK"" is B, L, E, A, K -> so A is at 3, not 4. So that doesn\'t fit.\n\nHow about ""CLEAN"" -> but N is absent.\n\n""FLEAM"" -> F, L, E, A, M -> A at 3? We need A at 4. So no.\n\nSo it\'s hard to have A at 4 and E at 2.\n\nNow, back to the candidates: ""HALED"", ""CAMEL"", and we can consider ""EQUAL"" but it has uncommon letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""LABEL"" -> but duplicate L? And we don\'t know. Also, L at 0? But L cannot be at 0. So invalid.\n\n""MAPLE"" -> M, A, P, L, E -> A at 1? Then E at 4? But E cannot be at 4. So invalid.\n\n""TABLE"" -> T is absent.\n\n""GAVEL"" -> G, A, V, E, L -> A at 1? Then E at 3? And L at 4. \nBut A at 1: valid (not 0 or 2). \nE at 3: valid (not 1 or 4). \nL at 4: valid (not 0). \nLetters: G, A, V, E, L -> G and V are allowed. \nWord: ""GAVEL"" is valid.\n\nSo we have another candidate: ""GAVEL"".\n\nNow, comparing:\n\n- ""HALED"": tests H, A (at 1), L (at 3), E (at 2), D. Positions: H(0), A(1), E(2), L(3), D(4). \n  - A at 1: new position for A.\n  - E at 2: new position for E.\n  - L at 3: new position for L.\n\n- ""CAMEL"": tests C, A (at 1), M, E (at 3), L (at 4). \n  - A at 1: new.\n  - E at 3: new.\n  - L at 4: new.\n\n- ""GAVEL"": tests G, A (at 1), V, E (at 3), L (at 4). \n  - A at 1: new.\n  - E at 3: new.\n  - L at 4: new.\n\n- ""EQUAL"": tests E (at 0), Q, U, A (at 3), L (at 4). \n  - E at 0: new.\n  - A at 3: we already tested A at 3 in LEANT? In LEANT, A was at index 2, not 3. So A at 3 is new? Actually, in LEANT, A was at index 2 (position 3 if counting from 1) but we are using 0-indexed: LEANT: index0=L, index1=E, index2=A, index3=N, index4=T. So we tested A at index2 and it was wrong. Now, in ""EQUAL"", A is at index3 (which is new). Similarly, E at index0 is new.\n\nBut ""EQUAL"" uses Q and U which are less common, so we might get less information.\n\nI think ""HALED"" is a good choice because it tests E at position 2 (which we haven\'t tested) and A at 1 (new) and L at 3 (new). Also, it uses H and D, which are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""CAMEL"" and ""GAVEL"" are also good.\n\nBut note: in ""HALED"", we are testing the position of E at 2, which is a position we haven\'t tried for E. Similarly, in ""CAMEL"", we test E at 3.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""HALED"" because it tests a different position for E (position 2) and we haven\'t tried that.\n\nSo let\'s choose ""HALED"".\n\nBut wait, we must ensure that we are not repeating a position for a letter that we know is wrong? We are not: for A, we haven\'t tried position 1; for E, we haven\'t tried position 2; for L, we haven\'t tried position 3.\n\nSo it\'s safe.\n\nTherefore, the next guess is ""HALED"".Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:\n- **A**, **E**, and **L** are confirmed to be in the word, but not in the positions guessed (A not at 1 or 3, E not at 1 or 5, L not at 1).\n- **R**, **I**, **S**, **N**, and **T** are absent and excluded.\n- Possible positions for A: 2, 4 (0-indexed positions 1 or 3, since position 0 is also invalid for A from Guess 1).\n- Possible positions for E: 1, 3 (0-indexed positions 0 or 2).\n- Possible positions for L: 2, 3, 4 (0-indexed positions 1, 2, or 3).\n\nThe new guess **HALED**:\n- Contains the required letters A, E, L.\n- Avoids absent letters (R, I, S, N, T).\n- Tests new positions:\n  - A at position 2 (0-indexed 1), which hasn\'t been tried.\n  - E at position 3 (0-indexed 2), which hasn\'t been tried.\n  - L at position 4 (0-indexed 3), which hasn\'t been tried.\n- Introduces new common letters (H, D) for additional information.\n\n<guess>HALED</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: ARISE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: LEANT -> FEEDBACK: L(-) E(-) A(-) N(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: HALED -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) L(-) E(✓) D(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ARISE
- A: present but wrong position (so A is in the word but not at position 0)
- R: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present but wrong position (not at position 4)

Guess 2: LEANT
- L: present but wrong position (not at position 0)
- E: present but wrong position (not at position 1)
- A: present but wrong position (not at position 2)
- N: absent
- T: absent

Guess 3: HALED
- H: absent
- A: correct (so A is at position 1, because in HALED, A is at index 1: positions are 0:H, 1:A, 2:L, 3:E, 4:D)
- L: present but wrong position (not at position 2)
- E: correct (so E is at position 3? In HALED, E is at index 3)
- D: absent

So, from the feedback:
- A is at position 1 (0-indexed index 1). This is fixed.
- E is at position 4 (0-indexed index 3? Let's clarify: if we consider the positions as 0,1,2,3,4, then in HALED:
  Position 0: H (absent)
  Position 1: A (correct) -> so A is at index 1.
  Position 2: L (present but wrong) -> L is in the word but not at index 2.
  Position 3: E (correct) -> E is at index 3.
  Position 4: D (absent)

Therefore, we now know:
- The word has A at index 1 and E at index 3.

Also, from Guess 1: E is not at index 4 (which we already know because it's at index 3 now), and A is not at index 0 (which is consistent because A is at index 1).

Additionally, L is in the word but not at index 2 (from HALED), and not at index 0 (from LEANT).

Moreover, we know the word contains L (from LEANT and HALED).

Absent letters so far: R, I, S, N, T, H, D. So we must avoid these.

Present letters: A (at index 1), E (at index 3), and L (somewhere, not at index 0,2, and cannot be at 1 or 3 because those are taken by A and E). So L must be at index 4? Let's see:

Positions: 
0: unknown (cannot be A,E, or L? But we don't know yet)
1: A (fixed)
2: unknown (but L cannot be here, as per HALED feedback)
3: E (fixed)
4: unknown (and L must go here? Since it can't be at 0,1,2,3? Index 1 and 3 are occupied, and L cannot be at 0 or 2. So indeed, L must be at index 4? Not necessarily because there might be more than one spot? But positions 0, 2, and 4 are open. However, L cannot be at 0 (from LEANT) and cannot be at 2 (from HALED). And index 1 and 3 are taken by A and E. So the only position left for L is index 4.

Therefore, L must be at index 4.

Now, we have:
- Position 0: ? (must be a letter not absent and not A,E,L)
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: ? (must be a letter not absent and not A,E,L)
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: L

We also know the word contains only these five letters. So position 0 and 2 are to be filled with letters that are not among the absent ones.

Absent letters: R,I,S,N,T,H,D.

So we can use letters from: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a five-letter word that has the following pattern: [letter0] A [letter2] E L

Where letter0 and letter2 are from the allowed set.

We have to choose letters such that the whole word is valid.

Moreover, since we have only 3 guesses left, we want to cover common letters.

Common letters we haven't tested: O, U, C, M, etc.

We can list possible words:

- The word ends with E L: ...EL, but specifically: [letter0] A [letter2] E L

So the word is of the form: _ A _ E L

Such words in English: 
- CABEL? Not sure.
- FABEL? Not English.
- GABEL -> not common.
- BABEL: B A B E L -> this has a repeated B? But is it valid? Yes, Babel is a word.

BABEL: B at 0, A at 1, B at 2, E at 3, L at 4.

But B appears twice. We don't know if the word allows duplicates.

But feedback hasn't indicated duplicates so far, and in previous guesses we didn't have duplicates. But it might be.

In BABEL, we have two Bs.

But the secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't seen evidence.

Other possibilities:

- C A M E L: CAMEL -> but M is in the middle? We have [letter0]=C, [letter2]=M -> C A M E L -> yes.

CAMEL: C at 0, A at 1, M at 2, E at 3, L at 4.

This matches the pattern and uses C and M.

- H A L E L: but H is absent and duplicate L? Not valid.
- J A W E L: J A W E L -> J at 0, W at 2.
- J A V E L: J at 0, V at 2. But ""JAVEL"" is not a common word? ""Javel"" is not standard; usually ""javelin"", too long.
- LABEL: but L at 0? But L cannot be at 0. Also L absent? And duplicate L? Not possible.
- M A Z E L: M at 0, Z at 2. ""Mazel"" is a word.
- R A T E L: but R is absent.
- W A D E L -> but D is absent? D is absent from HALED feedback (D: absent).

Absent letters: R,I,S,N,T,H,D.

So in ""WADEL"", D is absent -> invalid.

Another: ""BAYEL"" -> not a word.

""CAMEL"" is a valid word.

""FAMEL"" -> not a word.

""GAMEL"" -> not common.

""KAYEL"" -> not a word.

""PAPEL"" -> P A P E L -> duplicate P? But ""paypel"" not word.

""TACKEL"" -> too long.

Most promising is ""CAMEL"" and ""BABEL"".

But ""BABEL"" uses B at 0 and B at 2. If we guess it, and if the word is ""BABEL"", we would get:

Position 0: B -> correct? We don't know yet.
Position 2: B -> might be correct? But we would get feedback.

But note: we have to avoid absent letters. B is not in the absent list? No, so B is allowed.

Similarly, C and M in CAMEL.

Now, we already know that A, E, L are fixed at positions 1,3,4. So we don't need to test them again.

We need to find words that can test letter0 and letter2.

Since we have limited guesses, we can guess ""CAMEL"" because it uses common letters.

But note: in Guess 2 we guessed LEANT, which had N and T absent, so they are not in the secret word, and CAMEL has no N or T so safe.

Similarly, HALED had H and D absent, and CAMEL has no H or D.

So CAMEL is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""JAVEL""? But not a word? We have ""javelin"", not 5 letters.

""MAKEL"" -> not a word.

""NAVEL"" -> but N is absent.

""PAVEL"" -> proper noun? Not common.

""RAVEL"" -> but R is absent.

""WAVEL"" -> not a word.

So the only common words I can think of are ""CAMEL"" and ""BABEL"".

We can also consider ""YOKEL"": Y O K E L -> pattern: Y A? but we need A at position 1? Here we have Y at 0, O at 1, which is not A -> but our pattern requires A at position 1 and E at 3 and L at 4.

In ""YOKEL"": Y at 0, O at 1, K at 2, E at 3, L at 4. But we need A at position 1, not O. So invalid.

Another: ""LABEL"": cannot, because L at 0 is forbidden.

""HAZEL"": H is absent.

So indeed, ""CAMEL"" and ""BABEL"" are the main options.

Now, let's see if we can use a word that covers more possibilities? We have to guess a word that fits the pattern _ A _ E L.

I think both are reasonable. Since we want common words, and CAMEL is more common than BABEL, I'll go with ""CAMEL"".

Moreover, CAMEL uses letters that are common: C and M. BABEL uses B twice, which is less informative if B is not correct.

So I'll guess ""CAMEL"". 

But wait, we might win if the word is CAMEL? Or get feedback that helps.

So the guess is ""CAMEL"". 

But note: we already know A, E, L are fixed. So if we guess CAMEL:
- C at position 0: if it's correct, we get ✓; if not, we get x (if absent) or - (if present but wrong).
- Similarly, M at position 2: same.

If the word is CAMEL, then it's solved.

If not, we get feedback that will help us narrow down.

But we have only two letters to determine: the letter at index 0 and index 2, from the allowed set.

Since we have 3 guesses left (we are on guess 4 out of 6? we have guesses 4,5,6 left), we can take the risk.

So I'll go with ""CAMEL"".Based on the feedback:
- A is fixed at position 1 (✓ in HALED).
- E is fixed at position 3 (✓ in HALED). 
- L must be at position 4 (only remaining valid position).
- Pattern: _ A _ E L
- Absent letters: R, I, S, N, T, H, D → Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Common words fitting the pattern: CAMEL (C at 0, M at 2) or BABEL (B at 0 and 2).

Given CAMEL is a common word and uses letters not yet tested (C, M), it provides good coverage.

<guess>CAMEL</guess>
</think>
From the feedback of the previous guesses, we have established the following:

- **A** is confirmed at position 1 (index 1) and cannot be elsewhere.
- **E** is confirmed at position 3 (index 3) and cannot be elsewhere.
- **L** must be present in the word but not at positions 0, 2 (from feedback), and positions 1 and 3 are occupied by A and E, leaving position 4 (index 4) as the only possible slot for L.
- **Absent letters**: R, I, S, N, T, H, D. These cannot be used.
- The secret word must follow the pattern: `[position0] A [position2] E L`, where:
  - Position 0 must be filled with a letter not absent and not A/E/L.
  - Position 2 must be filled with a letter not absent and not A/E/L.
- Possible letters for positions 0 and 2: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Given this pattern, common valid words like ""CAMEL"" (C at position 0, M at position 2) fit and use untested common letters (C, M). ""CAMEL"" tests the remaining unknown positions efficiently and could solve the puzzle if correct.

<guess>CAMEL</guess>",CAMEL,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ARISE
- A: present but wrong position (so A is in the word but not at position 0)
- R: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present but wrong position (not at position 4)

Guess 2: LEANT
- L: present but wrong position (not at position 0)
- E: present but wrong position (not at position 1)
- A: present but wrong position (not at position 2)
- N: absent
- T: absent

Guess 3: HALED
- H: absent
- A: correct (so A is at position 1, because in HALED, A is at index 1: positions are 0:H, 1:A, 2:L, 3:E, 4:D)
- L: present but wrong position (not at position 2)
- E: correct (so E is at position 3? In HALED, E is at index 3)
- D: absent

So, from the feedback:
- A is at position 1 (0-indexed index 1). This is fixed.
- E is at position 4 (0-indexed index 3? Let's clarify: if we consider the positions as 0,1,2,3,4, then in HALED:
  Position 0: H (absent)
  Position 1: A (correct) -> so A is at index 1.
  Position 2: L (present but wrong) -> L is in the word but not at index 2.
  Position 3: E (correct) -> E is at index 3.
  Position 4: D (absent)

Therefore, we now know:
- The word has A at index 1 and E at index 3.

Also, from Guess 1: E is not at index 4 (which we already know because it's at index 3 now), and A is not at index 0 (which is consistent because A is at index 1).

Additionally, L is in the word but not at index 2 (from HALED), and not at index 0 (from LEANT).

Moreover, we know the word contains L (from LEANT and HALED).

Absent letters so far: R, I, S, N, T, H, D. So we must avoid these.

Present letters: A (at index 1), E (at index 3), and L (somewhere, not at index 0,2, and cannot be at 1 or 3 because those are taken by A and E). So L must be at index 4? Let's see:

Positions: 
0: unknown (cannot be A,E, or L? But we don't know yet)
1: A (fixed)
2: unknown (but L cannot be here, as per HALED feedback)
3: E (fixed)
4: unknown (and L must go here? Since it can't be at 0,1,2,3? Index 1 and 3 are occupied, and L cannot be at 0 or 2. So indeed, L must be at index 4? Not necessarily because there might be more than one spot? But positions 0, 2, and 4 are open. However, L cannot be at 0 (from LEANT) and cannot be at 2 (from HALED). And index 1 and 3 are taken by A and E. So the only position left for L is index 4.

Therefore, L must be at index 4.

Now, we have:
- Position 0: ? (must be a letter not absent and not A,E,L)
- Position 1: A
- Position 2: ? (must be a letter not absent and not A,E,L)
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: L

We also know the word contains only these five letters. So position 0 and 2 are to be filled with letters that are not among the absent ones.

Absent letters: R,I,S,N,T,H,D.

So we can use letters from: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a five-letter word that has the following pattern: [letter0] A [letter2] E L

Where letter0 and letter2 are from the allowed set.

We have to choose letters such that the whole word is valid.

Moreover, since we have only 3 guesses left, we want to cover common letters.

Common letters we haven't tested: O, U, C, M, etc.

We can list possible words:

- The word ends with E L: ...EL, but specifically: [letter0] A [letter2] E L

So the word is of the form: _ A _ E L

Such words in English: 
- CABEL? Not sure.
- FABEL? Not English.
- GABEL -> not common.
- BABEL: B A B E L -> this has a repeated B? But is it valid? Yes, Babel is a word.

BABEL: B at 0, A at 1, B at 2, E at 3, L at 4.

But B appears twice. We don't know if the word allows duplicates.

But feedback hasn't indicated duplicates so far, and in previous guesses we didn't have duplicates. But it might be.

In BABEL, we have two Bs.

But the secret word might have duplicates? But we haven't seen evidence.

Other possibilities:

- C A M E L: CAMEL -> but M is in the middle? We have [letter0]=C, [letter2]=M -> C A M E L -> yes.

CAMEL: C at 0, A at 1, M at 2, E at 3, L at 4.

This matches the pattern and uses C and M.

- H A L E L: but H is absent and duplicate L? Not valid.
- J A W E L: J A W E L -> J at 0, W at 2.
- J A V E L: J at 0, V at 2. But ""JAVEL"" is not a common word? ""Javel"" is not standard; usually ""javelin"", too long.
- LABEL: but L at 0? But L cannot be at 0. Also L absent? And duplicate L? Not possible.
- M A Z E L: M at 0, Z at 2. ""Mazel"" is a word.
- R A T E L: but R is absent.
- W A D E L -> but D is absent? D is absent from HALED feedback (D: absent).

Absent letters: R,I,S,N,T,H,D.

So in ""WADEL"", D is absent -> invalid.

Another: ""BAYEL"" -> not a word.

""CAMEL"" is a valid word.

""FAMEL"" -> not a word.

""GAMEL"" -> not common.

""KAYEL"" -> not a word.

""PAPEL"" -> P A P E L -> duplicate P? But ""paypel"" not word.

""TACKEL"" -> too long.

Most promising is ""CAMEL"" and ""BABEL"".

But ""BABEL"" uses B at 0 and B at 2. If we guess it, and if the word is ""BABEL"", we would get:

Position 0: B -> correct? We don't know yet.
Position 2: B -> might be correct? But we would get feedback.

But note: we have to avoid absent letters. B is not in the absent list? No, so B is allowed.

Similarly, C and M in CAMEL.

Now, we already know that A, E, L are fixed at positions 1,3,4. So we don't need to test them again.

We need to find words that can test letter0 and letter2.

Since we have limited guesses, we can guess ""CAMEL"" because it uses common letters.

But note: in Guess 2 we guessed LEANT, which had N and T absent, so they are not in the secret word, and CAMEL has no N or T so safe.

Similarly, HALED had H and D absent, and CAMEL has no H or D.

So CAMEL is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""JAVEL""? But not a word? We have ""javelin"", not 5 letters.

""MAKEL"" -> not a word.

""NAVEL"" -> but N is absent.

""PAVEL"" -> proper noun? Not common.

""RAVEL"" -> but R is absent.

""WAVEL"" -> not a word.

So the only common words I can think of are ""CAMEL"" and ""BABEL"".

We can also consider ""YOKEL"": Y O K E L -> pattern: Y A? but we need A at position 1? Here we have Y at 0, O at 1, which is not A -> but our pattern requires A at position 1 and E at 3 and L at 4.

In ""YOKEL"": Y at 0, O at 1, K at 2, E at 3, L at 4. But we need A at position 1, not O. So invalid.

Another: ""LABEL"": cannot, because L at 0 is forbidden.

""HAZEL"": H is absent.

So indeed, ""CAMEL"" and ""BABEL"" are the main options.

Now, let's see if we can use a word that covers more possibilities? We have to guess a word that fits the pattern _ A _ E L.

I think both are reasonable. Since we want common words, and CAMEL is more common than BABEL, I'll go with ""CAMEL"".

Moreover, CAMEL uses letters that are common: C and M. BABEL uses B twice, which is less informative if B is not correct.

So I'll guess ""CAMEL"". 

But wait, we might win if the word is CAMEL? Or get feedback that helps.

So the guess is ""CAMEL"". 

But note: we already know A, E, L are fixed. So if we guess CAMEL:
- C at position 0: if it's correct, we get ✓; if not, we get x (if absent) or - (if present but wrong).
- Similarly, M at position 2: same.

If the word is CAMEL, then it's solved.

If not, we get feedback that will help us narrow down.

But we have only two letters to determine: the letter at index 0 and index 2, from the allowed set.

Since we have 3 guesses left (we are on guess 4 out of 6? we have guesses 4,5,6 left), we can take the risk.

So I'll go with ""CAMEL"".Based on the feedback:
- A is fixed at position 1 (✓ in HALED).
- E is fixed at position 3 (✓ in HALED). 
- L must be at position 4 (only remaining valid position).
- Pattern: _ A _ E L
- Absent letters: R, I, S, N, T, H, D → Allowed letters: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Common words fitting the pattern: CAMEL (C at 0, M at 2) or BABEL (B at 0 and 2).

Given CAMEL is a common word and uses letters not yet tested (C, M), it provides good coverage.

<guess>CAMEL</guess>From the feedback of the previous guesses, we have established the following:

- **A** is confirmed at position 1 (index 1) and cannot be elsewhere.
- **E** is confirmed at position 3 (index 3) and cannot be elsewhere.
- **L** must be present in the word but not at positions 0, 2 (from feedback), and positions 1 and 3 are occupied by A and E, leaving position 4 (index 4) as the only possible slot for L.
- **Absent letters**: R, I, S, N, T, H, D. These cannot be used.
- The secret word must follow the pattern: `[position0] A [position2] E L`, where:
  - Position 0 must be filled with a letter not absent and not A/E/L.
  - Position 2 must be filled with a letter not absent and not A/E/L.
- Possible letters for positions 0 and 2: B, C, F, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Given this pattern, common valid words like ""CAMEL"" (C at position 0, M at position 2) fit and use untested common letters (C, M). ""CAMEL"" tests the remaining unknown positions efficiently and could solve the puzzle if correct.",Guess 4: CAMEL -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) A(✓) M(✓) E(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
