We are starting the game. We don't have any information yet, so we need to pick a word that can provide as much information as possible.
A good starting word should:
- Have 5 distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- Include common letters that appear frequently in English words.

Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

I think ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often used as starting words because they cover common letters and have no repeated letters.

Let me choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes the information I can gather. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities. The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- It contains 5 distinct letters, covering more possibilities.
- It includes common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N), which appear frequently in English words.
- This word is often used as a starter in word games due to its balanced set of common letters.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in subsequent guesses.

For the next guess, we want to test other common letters to uncover more about the word. Since we have only one confirmed letter (R) and four unknown positions, we should choose a word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Uses other common letters that haven't been ruled out (like T, O, I, S, L, U, D, etc.).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E.

Possible letters to consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible to maximize information.

A good candidate might be ""TRIES"" but note that E is ruled out. We cannot use E.

Another idea: ""PRISM"" — but we don't know if P, I, S, M are in the word.

Alternatively, ""BROIL"" — B, O, I, L are new.

But let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and use common letters.

Some options:
- ""TRUST"" — uses T, U, S, T (but T repeated, and we don't know if T is in the word)
- ""DRIFT"" — D, R, I, F, T (R is in position 2, and we test D, I, F, T)
- ""GRIND"" — but N is ruled out, so we cannot use N.

We must avoid N.

Another word: ""PROUD"" — P, R, O, U, D.

But perhaps we can do better by including more vowels? We know A and E are out, so the vowels left are I, O, U. We should test one of them.

Let me list some words that fit:
- ""PRICK"" — P, R, I, C, K -> but C is ruled out, so invalid.
- ""BRISK"" — B, R, I, S, K -> no ruled out letters? B, I, S, K are all allowed.

But we don't know if these letters are in the word. We are trying to test new letters.

""BRISK"" seems good: it uses B, I, S, K, all of which are not ruled out.

Another option: ""FRISK"" — F, R, I, S, K.

But we don't have any information on F or B.

Alternatively, ""TRIPS"" — T, R, I, P, S.

We could also consider ""CRISP"" but C is ruled out, so invalid.

We must avoid C, A, N, E.

Another common word: ""ROBIN"" — but N is ruled out, so no.

""ROAST"" — but A is ruled out.

So, let's go with ""BRISK"". It has:
- B in position 1
- R (confirmed) in position 2
- I in position 3
- S in position 4
- K in position 5

This way, we test B, I, S, K, and we already know R is correct.

If the word is ""BRISK"", we get it right. Otherwise, we get feedback on these new letters.

But note: we are only on the second guess, so it's okay to test multiple letters.

Another candidate: ""PRISM"" — P, R, I, S, M.

But ""BRISK"" is a valid word and uses common letters.

Alternatively, ""DRINK"" — but N is ruled out.

""WRING"" — N and G? But N is out.

So, ""BRISK"" seems a solid choice.

We could also consider ""TRUTH"" — but it has T repeated and U, H. Not as many distinct letters.

""BRISK"" has 5 distinct letters: B, R, I, S, K.

Therefore, I will guess ""BRISK"".

But note: the feedback for the first guess showed that R is in the correct position, so in ""BRISK"", R is in the same position, which is good.

Let me confirm: the secret word has R as the second letter, so any guess must have R in the second position to be valid and to test other positions.

So, the guess must be of the form _ R _ _ _.

Thus, ""BRISK"" is a valid guess.

We'll use that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
- R is in the correct position (marked ""✓"" as the second letter).

This means:
- The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _
- We must avoid using C, A, N, or E in future guesses.
- The next guess should test new common letters (e.g., B, I, S, K, T, O) to gather more information, while keeping R in the second position.

For the second guess, I chose ""brisk"" because:
- It fits the pattern _ R _ _ _.
- It uses new, common letters (B, I, S, K) that haven't been ruled out.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing the potential for informative feedback.
- It tests possibilities for the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions simultaneously.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
   Meaning:
     - R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
     - C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

2. Second guess: ""brisk"" -> B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)
   Meaning:
     - R (second letter) is still correct (we knew that).
     - I is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
     - B, S, K are not in the word at all.

Now we know:
- The secret word has R as the second letter and I as the third letter. So the pattern is: _ R I _ _
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, S, K (and also the previous ones: from first guess, we already had C,A,N,E excluded, now adding B,S,K).
- Since S is now excluded, and we had excluded many letters.

We have the form: _ R I _ _

The remaining two positions to guess are the first and last two letters (positions 1, 4, and 5).

But note: the word is 5 letters, so we have positions 1, 4, and 5 unknown.

Letters we cannot use (since they are excluded): A,B,C,E,K,N,S and the previous from ""crane"" which are C,A,N,E, and now from ""brisk"": B,S,K.

So total excluded letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

We need to find a word that starts with _ R I _ _, and uses only letters not in the excluded set.

Common letters available: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W X, Y, Z. But some of these are less common.

Since the word is ""?R I ? ?"", and the last two letters are missing.

Possible common letters for position 1: T, P, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, etc.

For example:
- TRIPS (but S is excluded, and also we have R I, so ""TRI"" but then last two? and S is out)
- We need something that doesn't use excluded letters.

List of possible words that fit: 
- Ends must be any two letters not excluded.

We know position 3 is I, so the word is _ R I X Y, where X and Y are not excluded.

But we don't have any constraints on the last two positions yet.

We can test common words like ""TRIAL"" but A is excluded.

""TRIED"" but E and D? E is excluded.

""PRINT"" but N is excluded.

""ORBIT"" but B and O? B is excluded.

""DRINK"" but N and K excluded.

We must avoid A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

So perhaps words like:
- ""TRILL"": T,R,I,L,L but L repeated? This might be valid. But let's check letters: T not excluded, R and I are in, L is new, but L repeated? 
- ""TRILL"" has two L's, which is okay, but it uses L and L.

Or ""TRIED"" is invalid because E is excluded.

Another word: ""PRIME"" but E is excluded? ""PRIME"" ends with E and M? But E is excluded.

""FRIDAY"" is too long, we need 5 letters.

Perhaps ""FRITH"" not common.

Common words that fit the pattern? 
- ""GRIMY"": G,R,I,M,Y (letters: G,M,Y) all not excluded? G, M, Y are available.

Similarly, ""DRIVE"": but E is excluded? D,R,I,V,E -> E is out.

""DRIVE"" not possible.

""TRIPE"": T,R,I,P,E -> E excluded? Yes.

How about ""CRIMP"" but C excluded.

So, I think ""GRIMY"" is a candidate: G, R, I, M, Y.

We haven't tested G, M, or Y.

Similarly, ""TRICE"" invalid because C and E.

Or ""PRICE"" C and E excluded.

Another word: ""ORRIS"" S excluded and possibly not common.

""WRING"" N excluded.

Perhaps ""PRIMO"": P,R,I,M,O -> letters P,M,O available? That might work.

Or ""TRIGO"" not common.

Let's think of common words ending with O: like ""TRIO"" but that's only 4 letters.

5-letter word: Must be 5 letters.

How about ""DRILL""? D,R,I,L,L -> D and L, and repeated L.

But L is available.

Other words: ""FRITZ""? F,R,I,T,Z -> F,T,Z available? Z is less common, but it might be.

But let's choose a word that tests more common letters.

Since we have only 4 tries left and we know two positions, we should aim to test multiple possibilities.

We also know that the first letter cannot be B or C (excluded), so it must be one of D, F, G, H, ... etc.

Similarly, the last two letters cannot include any excluded letters.

I think ""PRIMO"" (P,R,I,M,O) is valid: P, M, O are new letters.

Similarly, ""GRIMY"" (G,R,I,M,Y) is valid.

Or ""TRIMS"" but S excluded.

Another: ""FLIRT"" F,L,I,R,T? But position 3 is I? Not R I? Pattern is _ R I _ _, so third letter is I, then two more.

""FLIRT"" is F,L,I,R,T -> which would be positions? F L I R T -> so if secret word is FLIRT, then R is at position 4, but we have R at position 2? Conflict.

In our pattern, R must be at position 2, so words where R is not at position 2 are not possible.

We must have x R I y z.

Candidate words:
- ""PRIMO"" -> P R I M O
- ""GRIPT"" -> G R I P T -> letters G,P,T
- ""GRIPY"" ? not a common word.
- ""ORRIS"" not and S excluded.
- ""FRUIT"" F,R,U,I,T? Pattern: F R U I T -> has U in position 3, but we need I in position 3? We have I at position 3, so must be _ R I _ _, so after R I, it's two letters.

In ""FRUIT"": F is position 1, R position 2, then U position 3? Not I. So I must be at position 3.

So we need a word with second letter R, third letter I.

Like ""TRIND"" not common.

""GRILL"" -> G R I L L -> we can use G,L? L repeats. But it avoids excluded letters.

""TRILL"" -> T R I L L

Another common word: ""DRIPS"" S excluded.

""WRITE"" -> W R I T E -> E is excluded? Yes.

So, I think ""PRIMO"" or ""GRIMY"" or ""TRILL"" are possibilities.

But note, ""TRILL"" has double L, which might not be ideal because if L is in the word, we get less information? But it's acceptable.

Perhaps ""GRIMY"" is better because it uses Y, which is less common.

Or ""PRIMP"" -> P R I M P -> repeated P? invalid? ""PRIMP"" is a word? meaning to primp oneself. But repeated P? P R I M P -> letters: first letter P, last letter P? and repeated.

It might be acceptable? But let's choose without repeats.

Another word: ""BRINE"" but B and E excluded? B excluded, E excluded.

No.

""CRISP"" C and S excluded.

So, I'll go with ""PRIMO"". It uses letters P, M, O which are new and common.

Then, the guess is ""primo"".

If the word were ""prime"", but E is excluded, so impossible.

Similarly, ""price"" C and E excluded.

So ""primo"" is a valid guess.

Alternatively, ""tripe"" is not valid because E excluded.

So I think ""primo"".

But let's confirm: letters excluded so far: from the feedback, we have A,B,C,E,K,N,S excluded.

So: allowed letters: D,F,G,H,I,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But I is already known in correct position.

So ""PRIMO"" uses P, M, O which are all allowed.

The word is P R I M O.

Pattern: position 1: P, position 2: R (known), position 3: I (known), position 4: M, position 5: O.

We'll test these two new positions.

If the feedback shows M correct and/or O correct, etc.

But we don't know if P is correct.

It's a good probe.

We could also guess words that have repeated letters? But ""primo"" has no repetition.

I think ""PRIMO"" is a reasonable choice.

Another option: ""TRIPH"" not a word.

Or ""DWINE"" E excluded? ""dwine"" means something, but E excluded? Not? D W I N E -> N and E excluded? Yes.

""THRIP"" not common.

So, let's go with ""PRIMO"".

After analyzing the feedback from both guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
   - R is correct and in position 2.
   - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

2. **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)  
   - R is still correct in position 2 (already known).
   - I is correct and in position 3.
   - B, S, K are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R I _ _ (position 2 is R, position 3 is I).
- Confirmed missing letters: A, B, C, E, K, N, S (must be excluded from guesses).
- Valid letters to use: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Goal: Test the first, fourth, and fifth positions with new letters to gather more information.

For the third guess, I selected **""primo""** because:
- It follows the pattern (P R I M O) with R in position 2 and I in position 3.
- It tests new common letters: P (position 1), M (position 4), and O (position 5).
- It avoids all excluded letters and has no duplicates, maximizing information potential.
- Common words like ""prime"" or ""price"" are invalid due to excluded letters (E, C), making ""primo"" a strong probe word.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We don't have any information yet, so we need to pick a word that can provide as much information as possible.
A good starting word should:
- Have 5 distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- Include common letters that appear frequently in English words.

Common letters in English: E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C, etc.

I think ""CRANE"" or ""SLATE"" are often used as starting words because they cover common letters and have no repeated letters.

Let me choose ""CRANE"" as my first guess.

<guess> crane </guess>For the first guess, I need a word that maximizes the information I can gather. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants to help narrow down possibilities. The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- It contains 5 distinct letters, covering more possibilities.
- It includes common vowels (A, E) and consonants (C, R, N), which appear frequently in English words.
- This word is often used as a starter in word games due to its balanced set of common letters.
My goal is to use the feedback from this guess to inform subsequent attempts.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so the second letter is R)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The second letter of the secret word is R.
- The letters C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

Therefore, the secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _

We must avoid using the letters C, A, N, E in subsequent guesses.

For the next guess, we want to test other common letters to uncover more about the word. Since we have only one confirmed letter (R) and four unknown positions, we should choose a word that:
- Has R as the second letter.
- Uses other common letters that haven't been ruled out (like T, O, I, S, L, U, D, etc.).
- Avoids the letters C, A, N, E.

Possible letters to consider: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We also want to cover as many new letters as possible to maximize information.

A good candidate might be ""TRIES"" but note that E is ruled out. We cannot use E.

Another idea: ""PRISM"" — but we don't know if P, I, S, M are in the word.

Alternatively, ""BROIL"" — B, O, I, L are new.

But let's think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ _ _ and use common letters.

Some options:
- ""TRUST"" — uses T, U, S, T (but T repeated, and we don't know if T is in the word)
- ""DRIFT"" — D, R, I, F, T (R is in position 2, and we test D, I, F, T)
- ""GRIND"" — but N is ruled out, so we cannot use N.

We must avoid N.

Another word: ""PROUD"" — P, R, O, U, D.

But perhaps we can do better by including more vowels? We know A and E are out, so the vowels left are I, O, U. We should test one of them.

Let me list some words that fit:
- ""PRICK"" — P, R, I, C, K -> but C is ruled out, so invalid.
- ""BRISK"" — B, R, I, S, K -> no ruled out letters? B, I, S, K are all allowed.

But we don't know if these letters are in the word. We are trying to test new letters.

""BRISK"" seems good: it uses B, I, S, K, all of which are not ruled out.

Another option: ""FRISK"" — F, R, I, S, K.

But we don't have any information on F or B.

Alternatively, ""TRIPS"" — T, R, I, P, S.

We could also consider ""CRISP"" but C is ruled out, so invalid.

We must avoid C, A, N, E.

Another common word: ""ROBIN"" — but N is ruled out, so no.

""ROAST"" — but A is ruled out.

So, let's go with ""BRISK"". It has:
- B in position 1
- R (confirmed) in position 2
- I in position 3
- S in position 4
- K in position 5

This way, we test B, I, S, K, and we already know R is correct.

If the word is ""BRISK"", we get it right. Otherwise, we get feedback on these new letters.

But note: we are only on the second guess, so it's okay to test multiple letters.

Another candidate: ""PRISM"" — P, R, I, S, M.

But ""BRISK"" is a valid word and uses common letters.

Alternatively, ""DRINK"" — but N is ruled out.

""WRING"" — N and G? But N is out.

So, ""BRISK"" seems a solid choice.

We could also consider ""TRUTH"" — but it has T repeated and U, H. Not as many distinct letters.

""BRISK"" has 5 distinct letters: B, R, I, S, K.

Therefore, I will guess ""BRISK"".

But note: the feedback for the first guess showed that R is in the correct position, so in ""BRISK"", R is in the same position, which is good.

Let me confirm: the secret word has R as the second letter, so any guess must have R in the second position to be valid and to test other positions.

So, the guess must be of the form _ R _ _ _.

Thus, ""BRISK"" is a valid guess.

We'll use that.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are not in the word (all marked ""x"").
- R is in the correct position (marked ""✓"" as the second letter).

This means:
- The secret word has the form: _ R _ _ _
- We must avoid using C, A, N, or E in future guesses.
- The next guess should test new common letters (e.g., B, I, S, K, T, O) to gather more information, while keeping R in the second position.

For the second guess, I chose ""brisk"" because:
- It fits the pattern _ R _ _ _.
- It uses new, common letters (B, I, S, K) that haven't been ruled out.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing the potential for informative feedback.
- It tests possibilities for the first, third, fourth, and fifth positions simultaneously.

<guess>brisk</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. First guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)
   Meaning:
     - R is in the word and in the correct position (second letter).
     - C, A, N, E are not in the word at all.

2. Second guess: ""brisk"" -> B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)
   Meaning:
     - R (second letter) is still correct (we knew that).
     - I is in the word and in the correct position (third letter).
     - B, S, K are not in the word at all.

Now we know:
- The secret word has R as the second letter and I as the third letter. So the pattern is: _ R I _ _
- Letters not in the word: C, A, N, E, B, S, K (and also the previous ones: from first guess, we already had C,A,N,E excluded, now adding B,S,K).
- Since S is now excluded, and we had excluded many letters.

We have the form: _ R I _ _

The remaining two positions to guess are the first and last two letters (positions 1, 4, and 5).

But note: the word is 5 letters, so we have positions 1, 4, and 5 unknown.

Letters we cannot use (since they are excluded): A,B,C,E,K,N,S and the previous from ""crane"" which are C,A,N,E, and now from ""brisk"": B,S,K.

So total excluded letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

We need to find a word that starts with _ R I _ _, and uses only letters not in the excluded set.

Common letters available: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W X, Y, Z. But some of these are less common.

Since the word is ""?R I ? ?"", and the last two letters are missing.

Possible common letters for position 1: T, P, D, F, G, H, L, M, O, etc.

For example:
- TRIPS (but S is excluded, and also we have R I, so ""TRI"" but then last two? and S is out)
- We need something that doesn't use excluded letters.

List of possible words that fit: 
- Ends must be any two letters not excluded.

We know position 3 is I, so the word is _ R I X Y, where X and Y are not excluded.

But we don't have any constraints on the last two positions yet.

We can test common words like ""TRIAL"" but A is excluded.

""TRIED"" but E and D? E is excluded.

""PRINT"" but N is excluded.

""ORBIT"" but B and O? B is excluded.

""DRINK"" but N and K excluded.

We must avoid A,B,C,E,K,N,S.

So perhaps words like:
- ""TRILL"": T,R,I,L,L but L repeated? This might be valid. But let's check letters: T not excluded, R and I are in, L is new, but L repeated? 
- ""TRILL"" has two L's, which is okay, but it uses L and L.

Or ""TRIED"" is invalid because E is excluded.

Another word: ""PRIME"" but E is excluded? ""PRIME"" ends with E and M? But E is excluded.

""FRIDAY"" is too long, we need 5 letters.

Perhaps ""FRITH"" not common.

Common words that fit the pattern? 
- ""GRIMY"": G,R,I,M,Y (letters: G,M,Y) all not excluded? G, M, Y are available.

Similarly, ""DRIVE"": but E is excluded? D,R,I,V,E -> E is out.

""DRIVE"" not possible.

""TRIPE"": T,R,I,P,E -> E excluded? Yes.

How about ""CRIMP"" but C excluded.

So, I think ""GRIMY"" is a candidate: G, R, I, M, Y.

We haven't tested G, M, or Y.

Similarly, ""TRICE"" invalid because C and E.

Or ""PRICE"" C and E excluded.

Another word: ""ORRIS"" S excluded and possibly not common.

""WRING"" N excluded.

Perhaps ""PRIMO"": P,R,I,M,O -> letters P,M,O available? That might work.

Or ""TRIGO"" not common.

Let's think of common words ending with O: like ""TRIO"" but that's only 4 letters.

5-letter word: Must be 5 letters.

How about ""DRILL""? D,R,I,L,L -> D and L, and repeated L.

But L is available.

Other words: ""FRITZ""? F,R,I,T,Z -> F,T,Z available? Z is less common, but it might be.

But let's choose a word that tests more common letters.

Since we have only 4 tries left and we know two positions, we should aim to test multiple possibilities.

We also know that the first letter cannot be B or C (excluded), so it must be one of D, F, G, H, ... etc.

Similarly, the last two letters cannot include any excluded letters.

I think ""PRIMO"" (P,R,I,M,O) is valid: P, M, O are new letters.

Similarly, ""GRIMY"" (G,R,I,M,Y) is valid.

Or ""TRIMS"" but S excluded.

Another: ""FLIRT"" F,L,I,R,T? But position 3 is I? Not R I? Pattern is _ R I _ _, so third letter is I, then two more.

""FLIRT"" is F,L,I,R,T -> which would be positions? F L I R T -> so if secret word is FLIRT, then R is at position 4, but we have R at position 2? Conflict.

In our pattern, R must be at position 2, so words where R is not at position 2 are not possible.

We must have x R I y z.

Candidate words:
- ""PRIMO"" -> P R I M O
- ""GRIPT"" -> G R I P T -> letters G,P,T
- ""GRIPY"" ? not a common word.
- ""ORRIS"" not and S excluded.
- ""FRUIT"" F,R,U,I,T? Pattern: F R U I T -> has U in position 3, but we need I in position 3? We have I at position 3, so must be _ R I _ _, so after R I, it's two letters.

In ""FRUIT"": F is position 1, R position 2, then U position 3? Not I. So I must be at position 3.

So we need a word with second letter R, third letter I.

Like ""TRIND"" not common.

""GRILL"" -> G R I L L -> we can use G,L? L repeats. But it avoids excluded letters.

""TRILL"" -> T R I L L

Another common word: ""DRIPS"" S excluded.

""WRITE"" -> W R I T E -> E is excluded? Yes.

So, I think ""PRIMO"" or ""GRIMY"" or ""TRILL"" are possibilities.

But note, ""TRILL"" has double L, which might not be ideal because if L is in the word, we get less information? But it's acceptable.

Perhaps ""GRIMY"" is better because it uses Y, which is less common.

Or ""PRIMP"" -> P R I M P -> repeated P? invalid? ""PRIMP"" is a word? meaning to primp oneself. But repeated P? P R I M P -> letters: first letter P, last letter P? and repeated.

It might be acceptable? But let's choose without repeats.

Another word: ""BRINE"" but B and E excluded? B excluded, E excluded.

No.

""CRISP"" C and S excluded.

So, I'll go with ""PRIMO"". It uses letters P, M, O which are new and common.

Then, the guess is ""primo"".

If the word were ""prime"", but E is excluded, so impossible.

Similarly, ""price"" C and E excluded.

So ""primo"" is a valid guess.

Alternatively, ""tripe"" is not valid because E excluded.

So I think ""primo"".

But let's confirm: letters excluded so far: from the feedback, we have A,B,C,E,K,N,S excluded.

So: allowed letters: D,F,G,H,I,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But I is already known in correct position.

So ""PRIMO"" uses P, M, O which are all allowed.

The word is P R I M O.

Pattern: position 1: P, position 2: R (known), position 3: I (known), position 4: M, position 5: O.

We'll test these two new positions.

If the feedback shows M correct and/or O correct, etc.

But we don't know if P is correct.

It's a good probe.

We could also guess words that have repeated letters? But ""primo"" has no repetition.

I think ""PRIMO"" is a reasonable choice.

Another option: ""TRIPH"" not a word.

Or ""DWINE"" E excluded? ""dwine"" means something, but E excluded? Not? D W I N E -> N and E excluded? Yes.

""THRIP"" not common.

So, let's go with ""PRIMO"".After analyzing the feedback from both guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
   - R is correct and in position 2.
   - C, A, N, E are not in the word.

2. **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)  
   - R is still correct in position 2 (already known).
   - I is correct and in position 3.
   - B, S, K are not in the word.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: _ R I _ _ (position 2 is R, position 3 is I).
- Confirmed missing letters: A, B, C, E, K, N, S (must be excluded from guesses).
- Valid letters to use: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Goal: Test the first, fourth, and fifth positions with new letters to gather more information.

For the third guess, I selected **""primo""** because:
- It follows the pattern (P R I M O) with R in position 2 and I in position 3.
- It tests new common letters: P (position 1), M (position 4), and O (position 5).
- It avoids all excluded letters and has no duplicates, maximizing information potential.
- Common words like ""prime"" or ""price"" are invalid due to excluded letters (E, C), making ""primo"" a strong probe word.

That might work.\n\nOr ""TRIGO"" not common.\n\nLet\'s think of common words ending with O: like ""TRIO"" but that\'s only 4 letters.\n\n5-letter word: Must be 5 letters.\n\nHow about ""DRILL""? D,R,I,L,L -> D and L, and repeated L.\n\nBut L is available.\n\nOther words: ""FRITZ""? F,R,I,T,Z -> F,T,Z available? Z is less common, but it might be.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that tests more common letters.\n\nSince we have only 4 tries left and we know two positions, we should aim to test multiple possibilities.\n\nWe also know that the first letter cannot be B or C (excluded), so it must be one of D, F, G, H, ... etc.\n\nSimilarly, the last two letters cannot include any excluded letters.\n\nI think ""PRIMO"" (P,R,I,M,O) is valid: P, M, O are new letters.\n\nSimilarly, ""GRIMY"" (G,R,I,M,Y) is valid.\n\nOr ""TRIMS"" but S excluded.\n\nAnother: ""FLIRT"" F,L,I,R,T? But position 3 is I? Not R I? Pattern is _ R I _ _, so third letter is I, then two more.\n\n""FLIRT"" is F,L,I,R,T -> which would be positions? F L I R T -> so if secret word is FLIRT, then R is at position 4, but we have R at position 2? Conflict.\n\nIn our pattern, R must be at position 2, so words where R is not at position 2 are not possible.\n\nWe must have x R I y z.\n\nCandidate words:\n- ""PRIMO"" -> P R I M O\n- ""GRIPT"" -> G R I P T -> letters G,P,T\n- ""GRIPY"" ? not a common word.\n- ""ORRIS"" not and S excluded.\n- ""FRUIT"" F,R,U,I,T? Pattern: F R U I T -> has U in position 3, but we need I in position 3? We have I at position 3, so must be _ R I _ _, so after R I, it\'s two letters.\n\nIn ""FRUIT"": F is position 1, R position 2, then U position 3? Not I. So I must be at position 3.\n\nSo we need a word with second letter R, third letter I.\n\nLike ""TRIND"" not common.\n\n""GRILL"" -> G R I L L -> we can use G,L? L repeats. But it avoids excluded letters.\n\n""TRILL"" -> T R I L L\n\nAnother common word: ""DRIPS"" S excluded.\n\n""WRITE"" -> W R I T E -> E is excluded? Yes.\n\nSo, I think ""PRIMO"" or ""GRIMY"" or ""TRILL"" are possibilities.\n\nBut note, ""TRILL"" has double L, which might not be ideal because if L is in the word, we get less information? But it\'s acceptable.\n\nPerhaps ""GRIMY"" is better because it uses Y, which is less common.\n\nOr ""PRIMP"" -> P R I M P -> repeated P? invalid? ""PRIMP"" is a word? meaning to primp oneself. But repeated P? P R I M P -> letters: first letter P, last letter P? and repeated.\n\nIt might be acceptable? But let\'s choose without repeats.\n\nAnother word: ""BRINE"" but B and E excluded? B excluded, E excluded.\n\nNo.\n\n""CRISP"" C and S excluded.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""PRIMO"". It uses letters P, M, O which are new and common.\n\nThen, the guess is ""primo"".\n\nIf the word were ""prime"", but E is excluded, so impossible.\n\nSimilarly, ""price"" C and E excluded.\n\nSo ""primo"" is a valid guess.\n\nAlternatively, ""tripe"" is not valid because E excluded.\n\nSo I think ""primo"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm: letters excluded so far: from the feedback, we have A,B,C,E,K,N,S excluded.\n\nSo: allowed letters: D,F,G,H,I,L,M,O,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But I is already known in correct position.\n\nSo ""PRIMO"" uses P, M, O which are all allowed.\n\nThe word is P R I M O.\n\nPattern: position 1: P, position 2: R (known), position 3: I (known), position 4: M, position 5: O.\n\nWe\'ll test these two new positions.\n\nIf the feedback shows M correct and/or O correct, etc.\n\nBut we don\'t know if P is correct.\n\nIt\'s a good probe.\n\nWe could also guess words that have repeated letters? But ""primo"" has no repetition.\n\nI think ""PRIMO"" is a reasonable choice.\n\nAnother option: ""TRIPH"" not a word.\n\nOr ""DWINE"" E excluded? ""dwine"" means something, but E excluded? Not? D W I N E -> N and E excluded? Yes.\n\n""THRIP"" not common.\n\nSo, let\'s go with ""PRIMO"".After analyzing the feedback from both guesses:\n\n1. **Guess 1: crane** → C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  \n   - R is correct and in position 2.\n   - C, A, N, E are not in the word.\n\n2. **Guess 2: brisk** → B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)  \n   - R is still correct in position 2 (already known).\n   - I is correct and in position 3.\n   - B, S, K are not in the word.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the pattern: _ R I _ _ (position 2 is R, position 3 is I).\n- Confirmed missing letters: A, B, C, E, K, N, S (must be excluded from guesses).\n- Valid letters to use: D, F, G, H, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- Goal: Test the first, fourth, and fifth positions with new letters to gather more information.\n\nFor the third guess, I selected **""primo""** because:\n- It follows the pattern (P R I M O) with R in position 2 and I in position 3.\n- It tests new common letters: P (position 1), M (position 4), and O (position 5).\n- It avoids all excluded letters and has no duplicates, maximizing information potential.\n- Common words like ""prime"" or ""price"" are invalid due to excluded letters (E, C), making ""primo"" a strong probe word.\n\n<guess>primo</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: brisk -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(✓) I(✓) S(x) K(x)\nGuess 3: primo -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) M(x) O(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the third guess ""primo"":
- P: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so first letter is P)
- R: ✓ (already known to be in position 2)
- I: ✓ (already known to be in position 3)
- M: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

So now we know:
- The secret word starts with P, then R, then I: so it is ""P R I _ _""
- O is in the word but not in the fourth position (since we got a dash for O in position 5, meaning it's present but not there). Since the dash is for the fifth position, O is in the word but not at the end. It must be in the fourth position? But wait, the pattern is fixed: positions 1,2,3 are P,R,I. So the word is P R I _ _. The O is in the word but not in the fifth position. Therefore, O must be in the fourth position? But we have only two positions left: 4 and 5.

The feedback for O is a dash, meaning it is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was position 5). Therefore, O is in the word, but not at position 5. Since the only other position available is position 4, O must be at position 4? But we have to be careful: the dash only says it's not in that position, but it could be in the word elsewhere. However, in this case, positions 1,2,3 are fixed and we know they are P,R,I, so O cannot be there. Therefore, the only possibility is that O is in position 4.

But let me confirm: the word is P R I _ _. We guessed the fifth letter as O and got a dash, meaning O is in the word but not at position 5. Since positions 1,2,3 are taken by P,R,I (and we know they are fixed), O must be at position 4. Then what about position 5? We don't know yet.

Additionally, we have that M is not in the word (from the feedback of ""primo"", M is x).

So, the word is ""P R I O ?"", because O must be in position 4? But we have to consider: could O be in the word but not at position 4? No, because the only positions are 4 and 5, and we know it's not at 5, so it must be at 4.

Therefore, the word is ""P R I O ?"", and the last letter is unknown.

Now, what about the last letter? We know it cannot be any of the excluded letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S,M (M is now excluded because we got x for M in ""primo""). Also, from previous, A,B,C,E,K,N,S are excluded.

So excluded letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S,M.

We also know that O is already used in position 4, so the last letter cannot be O (but it wouldn't be anyway because we are looking for a different letter).

Now, what letters are possible for the last position? The remaining letters are: D,F,G,H,L,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But P is already used in position 1, but it could be repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in the previous guesses, we haven't seen any repetition. However, we must consider that repetition is possible.

But in this case, we have P at position 1, and we are looking for position 5. Could it be P? But we have no information that P is repeated. However, we cannot rule it out.

But let's see: if the last letter were P, then the word would be ""PRIPP"" which is not a word. So probably not.

Similarly, R and I are already used, but they could be repeated? But in the pattern, we have only one R and one I so far. But again, no rule against repetition.

But let's think of common words that start with ""PRIO"". The only common word I can think of is ""PRIOR"" or ""PRIZE"", but Z might be less common.

""PRIOR"": that would be P R I O R. But we have R at position 2 and 5? That's possible.

""PRION"": but N is excluded.

""PRIZE"": P R I Z E, but E is excluded.

So ""PRIOR"" is a candidate.

Are there others? ""PRIMO"" we tried, but M is excluded and O is not at the end.

But now we have the word as ""PRIO?"".

Other possibilities: ""PRIED"" but E and D? E is excluded.

""PRILL"" but L and L? and we have L available? But ""PRILL"" is P R I L L, so last two L's? But we have O to place? No, we have O must be at position 4? Because we have the pattern P R I _ _ and O is in the word but not at position 5, so must be at 4. So the word is P R I O ?

So the last letter must be a consonant probably.

Possible words: 
- PRIOR: P R I O R -> but R is repeated? That's acceptable.
- PRION: not, because N excluded.
- PRIZE: not, E excluded.
- PRIMO: not, M excluded and we tried.
- PRESS: S excluded and E excluded? Not.
- PRIVY: V and Y? P R I V Y -> but that would be positions: 1P,2R,3I,4V,5Y. But we need O in the word? We have feedback that O is in the word, but in ""PRIVY"" there is no O. So that would be inconsistent.

Therefore, the word must have an O. Since we have P R I O ?, and O is at position 4, then the word is P R I O X, where X is the last letter.

Now, what can X be? It must be a letter not excluded and such that P R I O X is a word.

Excluded letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S,M.

So possible letters: D,F,G,H,L,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we also have to consider that if we use a letter that has been excluded, we cannot. But we haven't excluded D,F,G,H,L, etc.

Now, common words:
- ""PRIOR"": P R I O R -> uses R again. R is already in the word? But we don't know if it can be repeated. The feedback from ""brisk"" had R at position 2, and in ""primo"" we had R at position 2, but we never tested another R. So repetition is possible.

Is ""PRIOR"" a valid word? Yes.

Another word: ""PRIED"" is invalid because E excluded.

""PRIGS"": G and S? S is excluded.

""PRICK"": C and K excluded.

""PRINT"": N and T? N excluded.

""PRIMO"": we tried and M is excluded.

""PRICE"": C and E excluded.

""PRIDE"": D and E? E excluded.

""PRIME"": E excluded.

So, ""PRIOR"" seems the most common word that fits.

But what about ""PRIVY""? But no O, so it doesn't have O, but we know O must be in the word. So invalid.

Similarly, ""PRISM"": S and M excluded.

""PRIAL"" not a word.

""PRILL"": P R I L L -> but then position 4 is L, not O? But we need O at position 4? Because we have to place O at position 4.

In ""PRILL"", there is no O, so it doesn't have O, but we know O is in the word. So it must be excluded.

Therefore, the only common word I can think of is ""PRIOR"".

But in ""PRIOR"", the last letter is R, which is already in position 2. Is that allowed? Yes, words can have repeated letters.

Moreover, in the feedback for ""primo"", we had O at position 5 marked as dash, meaning O is in the word but not at position 5. In ""PRIOR"", O is at position 4, and R at position 5. So that matches: O is present and at position 4, not 5.

Also, we have no information against R being repeated.

Therefore, I think the word is ""PRIOR"".

But let's confirm with the feedback we have.

If the word is ""PRIOR"", then:

First guess ""crane"": C not in word, R is at position 2 (correct), A not, N not, E not. Matches.

Second guess ""brisk"": B not, R at position 2 (correct), I at position 3 (correct), S not, K not. Matches.

Third guess ""primo"": P at position 1 (correct), R at position 2 (correct), I at position 3 (correct), M not in word, O is in the word but not at position 5 (in ""PRIOR"", O is at position 4, so correct that it's not at 5). So the dash for O is correct.

Therefore, it all matches.

But is there any other possibility? For example, could the last letter be something else?

Suppose the last letter is not R. What other words are there?

""PRIOT""? Not a word.

""PRIOD""? Not.

""PRIOL""? Not.

""PRIOF""? Not.

""PRIOG""? Not.

""PRIOH""? Not.

""PRIOV""? Not.

""PRIOW""? Not.

""PRIOX""? Not.

""PRIOZ""? Not.

So, I think ""PRIOR"" is the only common word.

Another word: ""PRIED"" is invalid.

Or ""PRION"" invalid.

So, I think we can confidently guess ""PRIOR"".

But to be thorough, let's see if there is any other word.

What about ""PRIMO"" but we know M is not in the word, and we tried.

Or ""PRISS"" S excluded.

No, I think ""PRIOR"" is the answer.

Therefore, for the fourth guess, we can guess ""PRIOR"".

But we have 6 tries, so we can guess it.

Alternatively, if we are not sure, we could guess a word that tests the last letter, but since we have only one position left and we know it must be a letter that forms a word with ""PRIO"", and ""PRIOR"" is the only one, I think it's safe.

Moreover, if we guess ""PRIOR"" and it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback and then we can adjust, but I don't see another word.

So, I'll go with ""PRIOR"".
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - R is in the word and in position 2.  
     - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  
   - **Guess 2 (brisk)**: B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)  
     - R (position 2) and I (position 3) are confirmed correct.  
     - B, S, K are not in the word.  
     - Secret word pattern: `_ R I _ _`.  
   - **Guess 3 (primo)**: P(✓), R(✓), I(✓), M(x), O(-)  
     - P is correct and in position 1, R (position 2) and I (position 3) are reconfirmed.  
     - M is not in the word.  
     - O is in the word but not in position 5 (indicated by ""-"").  
     - Updated secret word pattern: `P R I _ _`.  
     - Since O is present but not in position 5, and positions 1–3 are fixed (P, R, I), O must be in position 4. Thus, the pattern is `P R I O _`.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - From all feedback: A, B, C, E, K, N, S (from Guesses 1–2) and M (from Guess 3) are confirmed absent.  
   - Valid remaining letters: D, F, G, H, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - However, O is already placed in position 4, and P is in position 1, so the final position (5) must be a new or repeated letter from the valid set.  

3. **Deduce the Final Letter**:  
   - The secret word is `P R I O ?`, and it must be a valid English word.  
   - Common words fitting this pattern:  
     - `PRIOR`: Ends with R (R is repeated, which is allowed).  
     - Other possibilities like `PRION` (N excluded), `PRIZE` (E excluded), `PRIVY` (no O, but O is required), or `PRINT` (N excluded) are invalid due to excluded letters.  
   - `PRIOR` is the only common word that fits:  
     - Position 4 is O (as required).  
     - Position 5 is R (repeated from position 2, but repetition is possible and consistent with feedback).  
   - Feedback validation:  
     - If the word is `PRIOR`, all previous feedback aligns:  
       - `crane`: R (✓ in position 2), others (x).  
       - `brisk`: R (✓), I (✓), others (x).  
       - `primo`: P (✓), R (✓), I (✓), M (x), O (-) because O is in position 4, not 5.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - With the pattern `P R I O _` and no other valid words, `PRIOR` is the only logical guess. It uses the confirmed positions and excluded letters, and it resolves the final character.  

<guess>prior</guess>",prior,"We have the feedback from the third guess ""primo"":
- P: ✓ (correct and in the right position, so first letter is P)
- R: ✓ (already known to be in position 2)
- I: ✓ (already known to be in position 3)
- M: x (not in the word)
- O: - (in the word but in the wrong position)

So now we know:
- The secret word starts with P, then R, then I: so it is ""P R I _ _""
- O is in the word but not in the fourth position (since we got a dash for O in position 5, meaning it's present but not there). Since the dash is for the fifth position, O is in the word but not at the end. It must be in the fourth position? But wait, the pattern is fixed: positions 1,2,3 are P,R,I. So the word is P R I _ _. The O is in the word but not in the fifth position. Therefore, O must be in the fourth position? But we have only two positions left: 4 and 5.

The feedback for O is a dash, meaning it is in the word but not in the position we guessed (which was position 5). Therefore, O is in the word, but not at position 5. Since the only other position available is position 4, O must be at position 4? But we have to be careful: the dash only says it's not in that position, but it could be in the word elsewhere. However, in this case, positions 1,2,3 are fixed and we know they are P,R,I, so O cannot be there. Therefore, the only possibility is that O is in position 4.

But let me confirm: the word is P R I _ _. We guessed the fifth letter as O and got a dash, meaning O is in the word but not at position 5. Since positions 1,2,3 are taken by P,R,I (and we know they are fixed), O must be at position 4. Then what about position 5? We don't know yet.

Additionally, we have that M is not in the word (from the feedback of ""primo"", M is x).

So, the word is ""P R I O ?"", because O must be in position 4? But we have to consider: could O be in the word but not at position 4? No, because the only positions are 4 and 5, and we know it's not at 5, so it must be at 4.

Therefore, the word is ""P R I O ?"", and the last letter is unknown.

Now, what about the last letter? We know it cannot be any of the excluded letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S,M (M is now excluded because we got x for M in ""primo""). Also, from previous, A,B,C,E,K,N,S are excluded.

So excluded letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S,M.

We also know that O is already used in position 4, so the last letter cannot be O (but it wouldn't be anyway because we are looking for a different letter).

Now, what letters are possible for the last position? The remaining letters are: D,F,G,H,L,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. But P is already used in position 1, but it could be repeated? The feedback doesn't say anything about repeated letters, but in the previous guesses, we haven't seen any repetition. However, we must consider that repetition is possible.

But in this case, we have P at position 1, and we are looking for position 5. Could it be P? But we have no information that P is repeated. However, we cannot rule it out.

But let's see: if the last letter were P, then the word would be ""PRIPP"" which is not a word. So probably not.

Similarly, R and I are already used, but they could be repeated? But in the pattern, we have only one R and one I so far. But again, no rule against repetition.

But let's think of common words that start with ""PRIO"". The only common word I can think of is ""PRIOR"" or ""PRIZE"", but Z might be less common.

""PRIOR"": that would be P R I O R. But we have R at position 2 and 5? That's possible.

""PRION"": but N is excluded.

""PRIZE"": P R I Z E, but E is excluded.

So ""PRIOR"" is a candidate.

Are there others? ""PRIMO"" we tried, but M is excluded and O is not at the end.

But now we have the word as ""PRIO?"".

Other possibilities: ""PRIED"" but E and D? E is excluded.

""PRILL"" but L and L? and we have L available? But ""PRILL"" is P R I L L, so last two L's? But we have O to place? No, we have O must be at position 4? Because we have the pattern P R I _ _ and O is in the word but not at position 5, so must be at 4. So the word is P R I O ?

So the last letter must be a consonant probably.

Possible words: 
- PRIOR: P R I O R -> but R is repeated? That's acceptable.
- PRION: not, because N excluded.
- PRIZE: not, E excluded.
- PRIMO: not, M excluded and we tried.
- PRESS: S excluded and E excluded? Not.
- PRIVY: V and Y? P R I V Y -> but that would be positions: 1P,2R,3I,4V,5Y. But we need O in the word? We have feedback that O is in the word, but in ""PRIVY"" there is no O. So that would be inconsistent.

Therefore, the word must have an O. Since we have P R I O ?, and O is at position 4, then the word is P R I O X, where X is the last letter.

Now, what can X be? It must be a letter not excluded and such that P R I O X is a word.

Excluded letters: A,B,C,E,K,N,S,M.

So possible letters: D,F,G,H,L,P,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

But we also have to consider that if we use a letter that has been excluded, we cannot. But we haven't excluded D,F,G,H,L, etc.

Now, common words:
- ""PRIOR"": P R I O R -> uses R again. R is already in the word? But we don't know if it can be repeated. The feedback from ""brisk"" had R at position 2, and in ""primo"" we had R at position 2, but we never tested another R. So repetition is possible.

Is ""PRIOR"" a valid word? Yes.

Another word: ""PRIED"" is invalid because E excluded.

""PRIGS"": G and S? S is excluded.

""PRICK"": C and K excluded.

""PRINT"": N and T? N excluded.

""PRIMO"": we tried and M is excluded.

""PRICE"": C and E excluded.

""PRIDE"": D and E? E excluded.

""PRIME"": E excluded.

So, ""PRIOR"" seems the most common word that fits.

But what about ""PRIVY""? But no O, so it doesn't have O, but we know O must be in the word. So invalid.

Similarly, ""PRISM"": S and M excluded.

""PRIAL"" not a word.

""PRILL"": P R I L L -> but then position 4 is L, not O? But we need O at position 4? Because we have to place O at position 4.

In ""PRILL"", there is no O, so it doesn't have O, but we know O is in the word. So it must be excluded.

Therefore, the only common word I can think of is ""PRIOR"".

But in ""PRIOR"", the last letter is R, which is already in position 2. Is that allowed? Yes, words can have repeated letters.

Moreover, in the feedback for ""primo"", we had O at position 5 marked as dash, meaning O is in the word but not at position 5. In ""PRIOR"", O is at position 4, and R at position 5. So that matches: O is present and at position 4, not 5.

Also, we have no information against R being repeated.

Therefore, I think the word is ""PRIOR"".

But let's confirm with the feedback we have.

If the word is ""PRIOR"", then:

First guess ""crane"": C not in word, R is at position 2 (correct), A not, N not, E not. Matches.

Second guess ""brisk"": B not, R at position 2 (correct), I at position 3 (correct), S not, K not. Matches.

Third guess ""primo"": P at position 1 (correct), R at position 2 (correct), I at position 3 (correct), M not in word, O is in the word but not at position 5 (in ""PRIOR"", O is at position 4, so correct that it's not at 5). So the dash for O is correct.

Therefore, it all matches.

But is there any other possibility? For example, could the last letter be something else?

Suppose the last letter is not R. What other words are there?

""PRIOT""? Not a word.

""PRIOD""? Not.

""PRIOL""? Not.

""PRIOF""? Not.

""PRIOG""? Not.

""PRIOH""? Not.

""PRIOV""? Not.

""PRIOW""? Not.

""PRIOX""? Not.

""PRIOZ""? Not.

So, I think ""PRIOR"" is the only common word.

Another word: ""PRIED"" is invalid.

Or ""PRION"" invalid.

So, I think we can confidently guess ""PRIOR"".

But to be thorough, let's see if there is any other word.

What about ""PRIMO"" but we know M is not in the word, and we tried.

Or ""PRISS"" S excluded.

No, I think ""PRIOR"" is the answer.

Therefore, for the fourth guess, we can guess ""PRIOR"".

But we have 6 tries, so we can guess it.

Alternatively, if we are not sure, we could guess a word that tests the last letter, but since we have only one position left and we know it must be a letter that forms a word with ""PRIO"", and ""PRIOR"" is the only one, I think it's safe.

Moreover, if we guess ""PRIOR"" and it's correct, we win.

If not, we get feedback and then we can adjust, but I don't see another word.

So, I'll go with ""PRIOR"".### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (crane)**: C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(x), E(x)  
     - R is in the word and in position 2.  
     - C, A, N, E are not in the word.  
   - **Guess 2 (brisk)**: B(x), R(✓), I(✓), S(x), K(x)  
     - R (position 2) and I (position 3) are confirmed correct.  
     - B, S, K are not in the word.  
     - Secret word pattern: `_ R I _ _`.  
   - **Guess 3 (primo)**: P(✓), R(✓), I(✓), M(x), O(-)  
     - P is correct and in position 1, R (position 2) and I (position 3) are reconfirmed.  
     - M is not in the word.  
     - O is in the word but not in position 5 (indicated by ""-"").  
     - Updated secret word pattern: `P R I _ _`.  
     - Since O is present but not in position 5, and positions 1–3 are fixed (P, R, I), O must be in position 4. Thus, the pattern is `P R I O _`.  

2. **Excluded Letters**:  
   - From all feedback: A, B, C, E, K, N, S (from Guesses 1–2) and M (from Guess 3) are confirmed absent.  
   - Valid remaining letters: D, F, G, H, L, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
   - However, O is already placed in position 4, and P is in position 1, so the final position (5) must be a new or repeated letter from the valid set.  

3. **Deduce the Final Letter**:  
   - The secret word is `P R I O ?`, and it must be a valid English word.  
   - Common words fitting this pattern:  
     - `PRIOR`: Ends with R (R is repeated, which is allowed).  
     - Other possibilities like `PRION` (N excluded), `PRIZE` (E excluded), `PRIVY` (no O, but O is required), or `PRINT` (N excluded) are invalid due to excluded letters.  
   - `PRIOR` is the only common word that fits:  
     - Position 4 is O (as required).  
     - Position 5 is R (repeated from position 2, but repetition is possible and consistent with feedback).  
   - Feedback validation:  
     - If the word is `PRIOR`, all previous feedback aligns:  
       - `crane`: R (✓ in position 2), others (x).  
       - `brisk`: R (✓), I (✓), others (x).  
       - `primo`: P (✓), R (✓), I (✓), M (x), O (-) because O is in position 4, not 5.  

4. **Conclusion**:  
   - With the pattern `P R I O _` and no other valid words, `PRIOR` is the only logical guess. It uses the confirmed positions and excluded letters, and it resolves the final character.",Guess 4: prior -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) R(✓) I(✓) O(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
