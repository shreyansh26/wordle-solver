We are given the word ""crane"" with feedback:
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: x -> not in the word
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The letters C, A, N are NOT in the secret word.
 - The letter R is in the word but not in the second position.
 - The letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

 Also, since the word is 5 letters, and R and E are present but not in their guessed positions.

 Our goal is to come up with a new guess that incorporates this feedback.

 We must choose a word that:
 - Does NOT contain C, A, N.
 - Contains R and E (at least).
 - The R cannot be in the second position (index 1) and E cannot be in the fifth position (index 4).

 Additionally, since R and E are present, we can try to place them in other positions.

 Let me think of common English words that fit these constraints.

 We have R that must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4 (since index 1 is excluded, note: indexing starts at 0? But in the feedback, positions are: index0: C, index1: R, index2: A, index3: N, index4: E).

 Actually, the feedback positions are:
 Position 0: C -> x
 Position 1: R -> - (meaning R is elsewhere)
 Position 2: A -> x
 Position 3: N -> x
 Position 4: E -> - (meaning E is elsewhere)

 Therefore, in our next guess:
 - We should avoid putting R at position 1 and E at position 4.
 - We should also include R and E somewhere else.

 Moreover, we don't know if there are any other letters that might be in the word.

 A good approach is to try a word that uses other common letters and places R and E in new positions.

 Since we eliminated C, A, N, we have many letters left. We can try to use more vowels and common consonants.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc. Vowels: O, I, U possibly.

 Let me try to form a word containing R and E but without C, A, N.

 Example: We could try ""ROGUE"" but let's check:
 - R at position 0 -> acceptable? But note R was misplaced in position 1 so maybe position 0 is possible.
   However, we don't know if R is at position 0 or not? The feedback doesn't say anything about position 0 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was a dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at position 0, 2, 3, or 4? But wait, we also know E is at position 4 in the previous guess and was misplaced, so E is not at the end? Actually, E can be at any position except 4? Not necessarily: the feedback only says that in the first guess, the E at the fifth position (index4) was wrong. But E might be at another position.

 However, note: in the next guess we can place E at a different position.

 But also, the secret word might have E elsewhere? Yes.

 Now, let me consider the word ""STARE"". However, ""STARE"" has 'A' which we know is not in the word (from feedback: A is x). So avoid A.

 Alternatively, ""STORE"" has S, T, O, R, E. But we haven't eliminated S, T, O. 
 Also, note: in ""STORE"":
 - Positions: 
   0: S
   1: T
   2: O
   3: R
   4: E

 But we have constraints: R was in the word but not at position 1 -> in this guess R is at position 3 (which is acceptable). 
 E was not at position 4 in the secret word? Wait, in the feedback for the first guess, E was at position 4 and it was misplaced, meaning E is in the word but not at position 4. In this guess, we are placing E at position 4 again? That would be a problem because we know E cannot be at position 4. So we cannot put E at position 4 in this guess.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting E at position 4.

 So ""STORE"" is invalid because E is at position 4.

 Let me try ""ROUTE"": R at 0, O, U, T, E at 4 -> again E at 4? No, we cannot do that.

 We need a word with E not at the end? For example, in the middle.

 How about ""TRIBE"": 
 T, R at 1, I, B, E at 4 -> again E at 4? Avoid.

 Alternatively, how about ""SERVE"": 
 S, E at 1, R at 2, V, E at 4 -> E at 1 and 4? But we know E is in the word, so it can appear multiple times? The feedback didn't specify if there are duplicates. However, in the first guess we only had one E and it was misplaced. We don't know if the word has more than one E? So we can consider words with two E's? But let's not overcomplicate: we know at least one E is present, so we must include at least one E somewhere not at the fifth position.

 In ""SERVE"": 
 - Position 0: S -> okay
 - Position 1: E -> okay? But we don't have feedback for E at position 1. Only that it wasn't at position 4.
 - Position 2: R -> okay? Also, R was not supposed to be at position 1 -> here it's at position2, so acceptable.
 - Position 4: E -> avoid! We know E cannot be at position 4.

 So we have to avoid placing E at position 4.

 We need a word that has E in one of the positions 0, 1, 2, 3.

 Example: ""DRIVE"": 
 D, R at 1, I, V, E at 4 -> again E at 4? Not good.

 How about ""PERIL"": 
 P, E at 1, R at 2, I, L -> 
 Positions: 
  0: P
  1: E -> E is at index1 -> acceptable? We don't know if E is at index1 in the secret word.
  2: R -> R at index2 -> acceptable because previously R was at index1 and we know it wasn't there. 
  3: I
  4: L

 This word: PERIL
 - Contains E and R.
 - E is at position1 -> valid since we only know it's not at position4.
 - R is at position2 -> valid because we know it's not at position1.

 Also, we avoid C, A, N.

 It uses other common letters: P, E, R, I, L.

 So this seems like a good candidate.

 We could try other words as well, such as ""REPLY"", but that has Y which is less common. And ""PERIL"" has the advantage of testing two new vowels (I and no other vowel) and a mix.

 Alternatively, let me think: we know that in the secret word, R must be somewhere, and E must be somewhere not at the end. Another word could be ""MERGE"": 
 M, E at1, R at2, G, E at4 -> again E at4? Avoid.

 Or ""BERET"": 
 B, E at1, R at2, E at3, T -> 
 Positions: 
  0: B
  1: E -> okay
  2: R -> okay
  3: E -> okay (and we are testing if E appears twice? But we don't know, so it's acceptable)
  4: T -> but no E at4? Actually, in this word, E is at positions1 and3, not at4.

 However, wait: the fifth letter is T. So E is not at position4. Therefore, it's acceptable.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicates? We might, so we can try words with duplicate E's? But we have eliminated A and N, and C, so E might duplicate? Not sure.

 Alternatively, let's stick with ""PERIL"" because it is a valid word and doesn't have E at the end.

 Another possibility: ""RINSE"". But check: 
 R at0, I, N -> wait, we have N? N was eliminated because in the first guess N was an x -> meaning not in the word. So ""RINSE"" contains N -> cannot be used. So we must avoid N.

 Similarly, avoid A and C and N.

 Therefore, ""PERIL"" doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters.

 Let me confirm: 
 P: we don't know -> okay
 E: we want to include -> okay
 R: we want to include -> okay
 I: unknown -> okay
 L: unknown -> okay

 And positions: E at1, R at2 -> so R is not at1 (good) and E is not at4 (good).

 Therefore, ""PERIL"" is a good second guess.

 Let's consider another word: ""SPIRE"" -> 
 S, P, I, R, E at4 -> but E at4: avoid.

 Another word: ""GIVER"" -> 
 G, I, V, E, R at4 -> R is at4? and E at3? actually: 
 positions: 
  0: G
  1: I
  2: V
  3: E -> acceptable for E? we don't know if position3 is allowed? and R at4? but R could be at4? because previously R was only disallowed at position1? so position4 is allowed for R? 
 However, this word ends with R, and we do not know if that's bad? But we haven't eliminated it. Also, E is at position3 -> acceptable because we don't have any feedback that E cannot be at 3? 

 But note: we also don't know if R is allowed at position4? The feedback only said R is not at position1. Position4 is fine.

 However, another issue: the word ""GIVER"" has R at the end? and E at position3? So it might be acceptable? But we have E at position3 and R at position4? Then why stop at PERIL? Both are acceptable.

 However, we also want to cover more common letters? ""PERIL"" uses L, while ""GIVER"" uses V and R. V is less common? So maybe ""PERIL"" is better.

 Let's go with ""PERIL"".

 So the next guess: PERIL
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N are not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (index 1)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (index 4)

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E
- Avoid C, A, N
- R cannot be in position 2 (index 1)
- E cannot be in position 5 (index 4)
- Prioritizes common letters to maximize information

The word **PERIL** is chosen because:
- Contains R (placed at position 3, avoiding index 1)
- Contains E (placed at position 2, avoiding index 4)
- Uses P, I, L—common letters not yet tested
- Avoids eliminated letters C, A, N

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the word ""crane"" with feedback:
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: x -> not in the word
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The letters C, A, N are NOT in the secret word.
 - The letter R is in the word but not in the second position.
 - The letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

 Also, since the word is 5 letters, and R and E are present but not in their guessed positions.

 Our goal is to come up with a new guess that incorporates this feedback.

 We must choose a word that:
 - Does NOT contain C, A, N.
 - Contains R and E (at least).
 - The R cannot be in the second position (index 1) and E cannot be in the fifth position (index 4).

 Additionally, since R and E are present, we can try to place them in other positions.

 Let me think of common English words that fit these constraints.

 We have R that must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4 (since index 1 is excluded, note: indexing starts at 0? But in the feedback, positions are: index0: C, index1: R, index2: A, index3: N, index4: E).

 Actually, the feedback positions are:
 Position 0: C -> x
 Position 1: R -> - (meaning R is elsewhere)
 Position 2: A -> x
 Position 3: N -> x
 Position 4: E -> - (meaning E is elsewhere)

 Therefore, in our next guess:
 - We should avoid putting R at position 1 and E at position 4.
 - We should also include R and E somewhere else.

 Moreover, we don't know if there are any other letters that might be in the word.

 A good approach is to try a word that uses other common letters and places R and E in new positions.

 Since we eliminated C, A, N, we have many letters left. We can try to use more vowels and common consonants.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc. Vowels: O, I, U possibly.

 Let me try to form a word containing R and E but without C, A, N.

 Example: We could try ""ROGUE"" but let's check:
 - R at position 0 -> acceptable? But note R was misplaced in position 1 so maybe position 0 is possible.
   However, we don't know if R is at position 0 or not? The feedback doesn't say anything about position 0 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was a dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at position 0, 2, 3, or 4? But wait, we also know E is at position 4 in the previous guess and was misplaced, so E is not at the end? Actually, E can be at any position except 4? Not necessarily: the feedback only says that in the first guess, the E at the fifth position (index4) was wrong. But E might be at another position.

 However, note: in the next guess we can place E at a different position.

 But also, the secret word might have E elsewhere? Yes.

 Now, let me consider the word ""STARE"". However, ""STARE"" has 'A' which we know is not in the word (from feedback: A is x). So avoid A.

 Alternatively, ""STORE"" has S, T, O, R, E. But we haven't eliminated S, T, O. 
 Also, note: in ""STORE"":
 - Positions: 
   0: S
   1: T
   2: O
   3: R
   4: E

 But we have constraints: R was in the word but not at position 1 -> in this guess R is at position 3 (which is acceptable). 
 E was not at position 4 in the secret word? Wait, in the feedback for the first guess, E was at position 4 and it was misplaced, meaning E is in the word but not at position 4. In this guess, we are placing E at position 4 again? That would be a problem because we know E cannot be at position 4. So we cannot put E at position 4 in this guess.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting E at position 4.

 So ""STORE"" is invalid because E is at position 4.

 Let me try ""ROUTE"": R at 0, O, U, T, E at 4 -> again E at 4? No, we cannot do that.

 We need a word with E not at the end? For example, in the middle.

 How about ""TRIBE"": 
 T, R at 1, I, B, E at 4 -> again E at 4? Avoid.

 Alternatively, how about ""SERVE"": 
 S, E at 1, R at 2, V, E at 4 -> E at 1 and 4? But we know E is in the word, so it can appear multiple times? The feedback didn't specify if there are duplicates. However, in the first guess we only had one E and it was misplaced. We don't know if the word has more than one E? So we can consider words with two E's? But let's not overcomplicate: we know at least one E is present, so we must include at least one E somewhere not at the fifth position.

 In ""SERVE"": 
 - Position 0: S -> okay
 - Position 1: E -> okay? But we don't have feedback for E at position 1. Only that it wasn't at position 4.
 - Position 2: R -> okay? Also, R was not supposed to be at position 1 -> here it's at position2, so acceptable.
 - Position 4: E -> avoid! We know E cannot be at position 4.

 So we have to avoid placing E at position 4.

 We need a word that has E in one of the positions 0, 1, 2, 3.

 Example: ""DRIVE"": 
 D, R at 1, I, V, E at 4 -> again E at 4? Not good.

 How about ""PERIL"": 
 P, E at 1, R at 2, I, L -> 
 Positions: 
  0: P
  1: E -> E is at index1 -> acceptable? We don't know if E is at index1 in the secret word.
  2: R -> R at index2 -> acceptable because previously R was at index1 and we know it wasn't there. 
  3: I
  4: L

 This word: PERIL
 - Contains E and R.
 - E is at position1 -> valid since we only know it's not at position4.
 - R is at position2 -> valid because we know it's not at position1.

 Also, we avoid C, A, N.

 It uses other common letters: P, E, R, I, L.

 So this seems like a good candidate.

 We could try other words as well, such as ""REPLY"", but that has Y which is less common. And ""PERIL"" has the advantage of testing two new vowels (I and no other vowel) and a mix.

 Alternatively, let me think: we know that in the secret word, R must be somewhere, and E must be somewhere not at the end. Another word could be ""MERGE"": 
 M, E at1, R at2, G, E at4 -> again E at4? Avoid.

 Or ""BERET"": 
 B, E at1, R at2, E at3, T -> 
 Positions: 
  0: B
  1: E -> okay
  2: R -> okay
  3: E -> okay (and we are testing if E appears twice? But we don't know, so it's acceptable)
  4: T -> but no E at4? Actually, in this word, E is at positions1 and3, not at4.

 However, wait: the fifth letter is T. So E is not at position4. Therefore, it's acceptable.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicates? We might, so we can try words with duplicate E's? But we have eliminated A and N, and C, so E might duplicate? Not sure.

 Alternatively, let's stick with ""PERIL"" because it is a valid word and doesn't have E at the end.

 Another possibility: ""RINSE"". But check: 
 R at0, I, N -> wait, we have N? N was eliminated because in the first guess N was an x -> meaning not in the word. So ""RINSE"" contains N -> cannot be used. So we must avoid N.

 Similarly, avoid A and C and N.

 Therefore, ""PERIL"" doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters.

 Let me confirm: 
 P: we don't know -> okay
 E: we want to include -> okay
 R: we want to include -> okay
 I: unknown -> okay
 L: unknown -> okay

 And positions: E at1, R at2 -> so R is not at1 (good) and E is not at4 (good).

 Therefore, ""PERIL"" is a good second guess.

 Let's consider another word: ""SPIRE"" -> 
 S, P, I, R, E at4 -> but E at4: avoid.

 Another word: ""GIVER"" -> 
 G, I, V, E, R at4 -> R is at4? and E at3? actually: 
 positions: 
  0: G
  1: I
  2: V
  3: E -> acceptable for E? we don't know if position3 is allowed? and R at4? but R could be at4? because previously R was only disallowed at position1? so position4 is allowed for R? 
 However, this word ends with R, and we do not know if that's bad? But we haven't eliminated it. Also, E is at position3 -> acceptable because we don't have any feedback that E cannot be at 3? 

 But note: we also don't know if R is allowed at position4? The feedback only said R is not at position1. Position4 is fine.

 However, another issue: the word ""GIVER"" has R at the end? and E at position3? So it might be acceptable? But we have E at position3 and R at position4? Then why stop at PERIL? Both are acceptable.

 However, we also want to cover more common letters? ""PERIL"" uses L, while ""GIVER"" uses V and R. V is less common? So maybe ""PERIL"" is better.

 Let's go with ""PERIL"".

 So the next guess: PERILBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N are not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (index 1)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (index 4)

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E
- Avoid C, A, N
- R cannot be in position 2 (index 1)
- E cannot be in position 5 (index 4)
- Prioritizes common letters to maximize information

The word **PERIL** is chosen because:
- Contains R (placed at position 3, avoiding index 1)
- Contains E (placed at position 2, avoiding index 4)
- Uses P, I, L—common letters not yet tested
- Avoids eliminated letters C, A, N

We have two guesses and their feedback:

First guess: crane
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R is in the word but not at position 2 (index 1)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word but not at position 5 (index 4)

Second guess: peril
- P: ✓ (correct position) → So the first letter of the secret word is P.
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word but not at position 2 (index 1). Also, from first guess, we know E is not at position 5 (index 4).
- R: ✓ (correct position) → So the third letter of the secret word is R.
- I: x (not in word)
- L: x (not in word)

What we know so far:
- The secret word starts with P and has R as the third letter: P _ R _ _
- E is in the word, but not at position 2 (from peril feedback) and not at position 5 (from crane feedback). The possible positions for E are now positions 1 (if we consider index starting at 0) or 4? But note positions: 
  Index 0: P (fixed)
  Index 1: second letter → E cannot be here because in peril, E was at index 1 and got ""-"" meaning it's not there.
  Index 2: R (fixed)
  Index 3: fourth letter
  Index 4: fifth letter → E cannot be here (from crane)

So E must be at position 4? Wait, index 4 is the fifth letter? The positions are:
  0: P (first letter)
  1: second letter → E is not here (from peril)
  2: R (third letter)
  3: fourth letter
  4: fifth letter → E is not here? But from crane, E was at index 4 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So E must be at one of the other positions? But position 0 is fixed to P? Position 2 is fixed to R? So E must be at position 3? Because positions 0,2 are fixed and 1 and 4 are ruled out for E.

Let me clarify:
- The secret word is 5 letters: positions 0,1,2,3,4.
- We know:
  - Position 0: P (from peril's P✓)
  - Position 2: R (from peril's R✓)
- From crane: E is in the word but not at position 4? Actually, crane had E at position 4? Or at the fifth position which is index 4? So E is not at index 4.
- From peril: E is at index 1 and got ""-"", so not at index 1.

Therefore, E must be at either index 0? But index0 is P, so not E? Or index 3? That's the only position left: indices 0,1,2 are occupied? Index0 is P, index2 is R? Index1 and index1 is out? So index3 is the fourth letter? And index4 the fifth?

So positions available: index3 and index4? But index4 is ruled out for E? Therefore, E must be at index3? But index3 is the fourth letter? Yes.

So: the secret word has P at start, then some letter at position1, then R at position2, then E at position3? And then a letter at position4? But we know from crane that E is in the word? Yes.

Additionally, from crane we have R at index1 and it was ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at index1? But now we know R is at index2? So that's consistent? And E at index3? Which wasn't present in crane? Because in crane E was at index4? So index3 wasn't tested? So that's fine.

Therefore, we have: P _ R E _ 

The word must be of the form: P? R E ? 

Now, what about the missing letters? We know:
- C, A, N, I, L are not in the word? From first guess: C, A, N out. From second: I and L out.
- E is at position3? 
- We have two positions: position1 and position4.

Moreover, what letters are present? We know R and E and P? Also, from crane feedback, we had R and E indicated? So the secret word must have R and E? Yes.

What about position1? We must choose a letter that hasn't been eliminated? And that is not any of: C, A, N, I, L? And also, we haven't tested any other letters? Well, we also know that in crane, the first letter C was out? Then peril had P, E, R, I, L? So I and L are out? Therefore, the set of eliminated letters: C, A, N, I, L? 

Still many letters left? E.g., B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters.

Now, we must form a word: P ? R E ? 

And the fifth letter (index4) is the last one? We don't know? 

But also, we have the R? And E? 

Moreover, we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far? So let's assume no duplicates? Since we haven't been warned? 

Therefore, the letter at position1 and position4 must be distinct? And must not be any of the eliminated ones? 

Also, we know from crane: R was in the word but not at index1? Well, we have R at index2? So position1? We don't know yet? 

Similarly, crane didn't test position3? So E was not at index4? But now we place E at index3? 

So for our next guess, we can test the form: P? R E ? 

But we don't know position1 and position4? 

We can choose a word that fits: P? R E ? 

For example, we can try: PUREM? But not a word? 

Valid English words: 
- PURE? Only 4 letters? Must be 5 letters.
- PURED? Not a word? 
- PURGE? 
  P U R G E -> 
  We have R at index2? The word PURGE: 
    P at0, U at1, R at2, G at3, E at4? 
  But according to our reasoning, E should be at index3? And G would be at index3? Then E at index4? But we thought E must be at index3? 

Wait, this conflicts? Let me reexamine:

We have: 
- Secret word has E in it? 
- Positions where E can be? 
  From peril feedback: E was at index1 and wrong? So E not at index1? 
  From crane feedback: E was at index4 and wrong? So E not at index4? 
  Therefore, E must be at index0? Index0 is P? So impossible? Or at index3? 

But index3: fourth letter? 

For example, in PURE? But again, not 5 letters? 

We need a 5-letter word? So positions: 
0: P 
1: ? 
2: R 
3: ? 
4: ? 

But in our earlier, we concluded E must be at index3? Because we already eliminated index1 and index4? 

But index0 is taken by P? Index2 by R? Only index3 left? So E must be at index3? 

Therefore, the word is: P ? R E ? 

And the last letter at index4? 

Therefore, structure: P, then a letter at1, then R, then E, then a letter at4? 

Now, examples of English words: 
- PREY? Only 4 letters? 
- PRESS? 
  But structure: P, R, E, S, S -> but positions: 
    0:P, 1:R? Wait no: we have R at position2? In PRESS: 
      P(0), R(1), E(2), S(3), S(4)? 
  But we require R at position2 (index2)? So cannot be at index1? 

We need the R at index2? And E at index3? So:
Positions: 
0: P
1: ? 
2: R 
3: E 
4: ?

So the word must be: ? P (1st letter)? R (3rd letter)? E (4th letter) and last letter? 

So possible words: 
- PRE? D? -> PREED? Not a word?
- PREST? 
  P, R, E, S, T -> but that has E at index2? We need E at index3? 

Actually, we need: 
Position 0: P 
Position 1: ? (a letter we don't know) 
Position 2: R 
Position 3: E 
Position 4: ? 

So we have letters: P, ?, R, E, ? 

Now, valid English words: 
- PROSE? 
  P, R, O, S, E -> that’s P(0), R(2)? Wait, positions: 
  0: P
  1: R? -> but R is at index1? We need R at index2? Instead, it has O at index2? 

So no? 

- PRICE? But I is eliminated? I is out? Peril had I and it was x? 

- PRUDE? 
  P, R, U, D, E -> structure: 
  0: P
  1: R? at1? But we need R at index2? Instead, it has U at2? 

We need R at index2? Meaning the third letter is R? 

Examples: 
- PRE? E? Not easy? 

Another word: PRI? E? But I out? 

Possible words: 
- PROBE? 
  P, R, O, B, E -> E is at index4? But that's invalid? Because we know E not at index4? 

But in PROBE: E is at the end? Index4? We cannot have E there? 

- PRONE? 
  P, R, O, N, E -> but N is eliminated from first guess? N is out? 

- PROSE? E at end? No? 

What about: 
- PRIME? But I is out? 
- PRATE? A is out? 
- PROVE? 
  P, R, O, V, E -> E at index4? Disallowed? 

But again, E not at4.

Therefore, the only possibility is to have E at index3? And then we need a word with form: P, (letter), R, E, (letter)

Valid English words? 
- PERSE? Not common? 
- WORDS: PRE? Let me list:
  One common word: P R E S T? Prest is not common?
  Another: *PRESET? 6 letters?
  5-letter words with pattern P?RE?

Perhaps: 
- PURSE: P, U, R, S, E -> 
  Positions: 
  0: P
  1: U
  2: R -> yes
  3: S -> but E? At index4? But we need E at index3? In PURSE, index3 is S? Index4 is E? -> but E at index4? Which we cannot have? 

Unless our initial reasoning was wrong? 

Therefore, we must reconsider the position of E? 

Reexamine feedback:

First guess: crane -> 
  Positions: 
    0: C -> x
    1: R -> -
    2: A -> x
    3: N -> x
    4: E -> -
  Meaning: 
    C, A, N not in word? 
    R in word, not at index1? 
    E in word, not at index4? 

Second guess: peril? 
  Positions: 
    0: P -> ✓ → P correct at index0? 
    1: E -> - → E in word, not at index1? 
    2: R -> ✓ → R correct at index2? 
    3: I -> x
    4: L -> x

Now, we have:
- The secret word has P at0? R at2? 
- And E must be in the word? But where? 
From peril, E was guessed at index1? And given ""-"", so E is in the word but not at index1? 
From crane, E was at index4? And given ""-"", so E in word but not at index4? 

Therefore, the only possibilities are index3? Since index0,2 are fixed? And index1,4 ruled out? 

But index3: the fourth letter? 

Therefore, the secret word must be: 
  P at0, ? at1, R at2, E at3, ? at4? 

And such word exists? 

Examples: 
- FRE? E? 
Not easy? Few ones:

- PRE?D: Not common? 
- SPREE? 
  S,P,R,E,E? That’s 5 letters: 
    0: S? -> not P? 

But we must start with P? 

Therefore, the only word that comes to mind is: ""PUREE""? 
PUREE: P, U, R, E, E? 
But positions:
  0: P? OK?
  1: U? 
  2: R? OK? 
  3: E? OK? 
  4: E? 

And E at index3? Yes? And E at index4? But we have two E's? And it is a word?

And feedback: 
From crane: E at index4 was given ""-"", meaning the secret word has an E but not at position4? In a word with two E's? It could be? The E is present? So our guess crane had E at4? Which is not the position of E? Because E is at3? But if there's another E at4? Then the first guess would have shown E at4 as correct? Because it is present? But crane's E at index4 got a dash? Meaning it is in the word but not at that position? If the secret word has an E at4, then crane's E at4 would have been ✓? 

Therefore, for crane's guess:
- If the secret word had an E at the fifth position (like in puree)? Then the feedback for E would be ✓? But crane got ""-""? So if secret word is puree, then crane's E at4? It should be matched? But feedback was ""-"" meaning it's not at that position? Hence, secret word cannot have E at index4? Even if there is another E? 

So puree has E at index3 and index4? 
- The E at index4? Is present? So in crane's guess, when we put E at4? It would be correct if secret has an E at4? 

But in crane, we got ""-"" for E, meaning: the secret has an E, but not at position4? So even though there may be an E at4 in the secret? The feedback would have been ""✓"" if there were an E at that position? Because it's a match? 

But crane's E at4 got ""-"", so that indicates that the secret does not have E at4? 

In puree, there is an E at4? So crane's E at4 would have been ✓? But the feedback was ""-"" for E at4? Therefore, puree cannot be the word? 

Similarly, any word with E at4 is disallowed? 

Therefore, our structure must be P? R E ? with E only at index3? And not at4? 

Another possibility: ""PREDY""? but not common? 

Or ""PRENT""? But N out? 

Or ""PRESA""? Not 5 letters? 

I'm struggling? Let's consider that our deduction about the position of E might be correct, but the word is rare? 

Alternatively, perhaps there are other words? 

Another word: ""PROKE""? Or ""PRUME""? Not valid? 

Valid English words: 
- ""pure""? but 4 letters? 
- ""press""? has E at2? 
- ""price""? has I? Out? 
- ""prase""? But A out? 
- ""prime""? I out? 
- ""prose""? has O? And E at4? But disallowed? 
- ""prove""? E at4? 
- ""prude""? E at4? 

The only one I can think of is ""PREED""? But not valid? 

But wait, there is ""PREED"" in some dictionaries? But let's avoid? 

Another idea: perhaps we missed that in the first guess, crane had R at index1? And got ""-""? And in peril we have R at index2 and got ""✓""? So R is fixed at index2? 

Also, E cannot be at index1 or index4? 

But what if the word has E at index0? But index0 is P? So not? 

Therefore, index3 is the only possibility? 

Then we must have a 5-letter word: letter1 at index1? And letter2 at index4? 

So: P, X, R, E, Y? 

And X and Y are letters not eliminated? And not C,A,N,I,L? 

Moreover, the word must be valid? 

Examples: 
- ""PER I E S""? No? 
- ""PRESENT"" is 6 letters? 
- ""PRED""? No? 

Let me search: 
  BRED? Not starting with P? 
  CRED? No? 
  DRED? No? 
  FRED? No? 
  GRED? Not a word? 
  PIRED? But I out? 
  TRED? 
  But no? 

Another: PARSE? A out? 

PORED? O? And E at4? 

 But E at4 disallowed? 

Then ""PORES""? has O? and E at4? 

Same issue? 

Perhaps ""PORKY""? No E? 

But we need E? 

Therefore, maybe our deduction is incorrect? 

Another possibility: in peril, the? Maybe E is at a different position? But peril's feedback showed E as ""-"", so it is in the word? How else? 

Perhaps the word has duplicate E's? For example, at different positions? 

But we've ruled out index1 and index4 for E? So only index3? 

But let's brainstorm words: 
  PIRE? No?
  PER?? But then E at1? And peril has E at1? But got ""-"", so E not at1? 

Therefore, the only remaining is that E must be at index3? 

And the last letter at index4? So we have to guess a word that has P, then a letter, then R, then E, then a letter? 

One common word: ""PREZA""? Not? 
Another: ""PHREV""? Not? 

Perhaps ""PRED""? Not 5? 
""PRES"" not 5? 
""PREST"" has E at2? 

But we need E at3? 

Example: ""PRET"" not 5?

Another: ""GREET"" not P? 

""FREED"" not P? 

""BREED"" not P? 

 Then what? 

Perhaps ""PRI E D""? But I out? 

Then ""PROBE"" E at4? 

Disallowed? 

Unless the feedback for E in crane means that for crane's guess at position4, it is not E it is something else? But E is still in the word? 

But the structure must have P, X, R, E, Y? 

Valid word: ""PAR E S""? A out? 

""PURE""? 4 letters? 

""PURELY"" 6 letters? 

So perhaps "" puree"" is accepted? Even though it has E at the end? But crane feedback conflict? 

Or another word: ""P R E E N""? 6 letters? 

""PRET""? No? 

Perhaps we got the positions wrong? 

Let's double-check indices:

For peril:
  P (index0), E (index1), R (index2), I (index3), L (index4)

Feedback:
  P(0) ✓ -> P correct at0
  E(1) - -> E in word but not at1
  R(2) ✓ -> R correct at2
  I(3) x? But if the secret has E at3? Then why not? 

But in peril's feedback, index3 was I and it was x? And we are assuming E is at3? So in secret at3 is E? So peril's I was mismatched? 

But for the secret word, pattern PxREx? 

And peril at index3 was I? Which is not correct? 

Now, new guess: we know almost the word is P? R E? 

But we don't know the first blank and the last blank? 

We can try a guess that fits and tests potential letters? 

For example, choose a word that has the form P* R E *? With * being new letters? 

For example, ""PR EED"" not valid? 

""PRED?"" no? 

""PR E S T"" but then E is at index2? Not index3? 

Alternatively to test, perhaps ""PRE E"" is not possible? 

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""PREED"" but it's not valid in some dictionaries? 

But let's consider common words: 
  5 letters, start with P, third letter R, fourth letter E? 

Upon checking words: 
- PREED? Not common? 
- PREEN? Yes, ""preen"" is a word: P, R, E, E, N? But problem: נN is out? First guess had N as x? And ""preen"" has N at the end? So cannot? 

- PRESS? P, R, E, S, S? Fifth letter S? But positions: 
  P(0), R(1), E(2), S(3), S(4) -> but we need R at index2? This has R at index1? And E at index2? So does not match our structure? 

Unless our indices are off? 

Position0: P? 
Position1: first blank? 
Position2: R? 
Position3: E? 
Position4: last blank? 

In ""PRESS"": 
  P at0, R at1, E at2, S at3, S at4? 
  -> R at index1? But we need R at index2? -> does not satisfy? 

What about: ""PRUDE""? P, R, U, D, E? -> same issue? R at index1? 

But our requirement is R at index2? 

To have R at index2? and P at0? then index1 can be any letter? 

For example, ""PORES"": P, O, R, E, S? 
This is: 
  P at0
  O at1
  R at2? -> yes
  E at3? -> Wait, in ""PORES"", fourth letter is E? Which would be index3? 
  S at4? 
Perfect? And ""PORES"" is a word? 

Now, does it match feedback? 
First, crane: 
  crane has R at index1? But in pores, R is at index2? So match ""-"" because R is present but not at the position guessed? 
  crane had E at index4? But in pores, E is at index3? And there's no E at index4? Since last letter is S? So E present but not at index4? So feedback for E in crane is ""-"" is correct? 

Peril: 
  For peril, we have:
    P✓ -> correct, first letter P? 
    E at index1: O at index1 in pores is not E? But E is in the word? At index3? So peril's E at index1 should be marked as ""-""? And it was? 
    R at index2: R is at index2 in pores? So marked ""✓"" which matches? 
    I at index3: in peril? And in secret, index3 is E? So not I? marked ""x"" is correct? 
    L at index4: secret has S? So not L? ""x"" correct? 

So ""PORES"" fits? 

And in guess2, peril's feedback: I and L are out? 

So secret word can be ""PORES""?
 But pores: P O R E S -> positions:
  0: P
  1: O
  2: R
  3: E
  4: S

And we have:
- P at0: yes
- O at1: we didn't know? Now we know?
- R at2: yes
- E at3: yes
- S at4: yes

And feedback matches? 

Therefore, our next guess can be ""PORES"" in hopes of getting it? 

But we are to guess? 

But also, there might be other words? Like ""PARES"", but A out? ""PURES""? U? ""PORES"" is one? 

Another word: ""PRIES"" but I out? 

""PKUES?"" not valid? 

So ""PORES"" or "" Pomes"" (P O M E S) but then R is not there? 

But we know R is in the word? 

In PORES, we have O and S as new letters? 

But in our next guess, since we have limited tries? We can guess PORES? 

But we are at guess3? We have 4 tries left? 

Since we strongly suspect PORES? But let's not jump? We can use a guess that might give more information? 

But if we think PORES fits, we can try it? 

Perhaps another word: ""P R E S T"" but E at2? Doesn't fit? 

 The only word I can think of is ""PORES"" or "" P R E E N"" but N out? 

 Therefore, I think ""PORES"" is a good guess? 

But earlier we deduced that E must be at index3? And R at2? 

So <guess>pores</guess>? 

But let's confirm: in our structure, E is at index3? In ""PORES"" yes: index0:P,1:O,2:R,3:E,4:S? 

So E at3? Index3 is the fourth letter? Yes.
</think>
After analyzing the previous feedback, the following conclusions are drawn:

1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (crane):**
   - C (position 0) ❌: Not in the word.
   - R (position 1) ➖: In the word but wrong position.
   - A (position 2) ❌: Not in the word.
   - N (position 3) ❌: Not in the word.
   - E (position 4) ➖: In the word but wrong position.

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (peril):**
   - P (position 0) ✅: Correct and in position.
   - E (position 1) ➖: In the word but wrong position.
   - R (position 2) ✅: Correct and in position.
   - I (position 3) ❌: Not in the word.
   - L (position 4) ❌: Not in the word.

### Key Deductions:
- The word starts with **P** (from peril's ✅ feedback).
- The third letter is **R** (from peril's ✅ feedback).
- **E** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (as per ➖ feedback from peril and crane). This leaves **position 3 (index 3)** as the only possible location for E.
- Eliminated letters: **C**, **A**, **N**, **I**, **L** (confirmed ❌ from feedback).
- The secret word structure is: **P _ R E _**, where:
  - Position 0: P (fixed).
  - Position 1: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, I, or L).
  - Position 2: R (fixed).
  - Position 3: E (deduced from constraints).
  - Position 4: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, I, or L).

### Strategy for This Guess:
- Test a valid word that fits the structure **P _ R E _**.
- Prioritize common letters for positions 1 and 4 to maximize information.
- After reviewing possible words, the word **PORES** fits all constraints:
  - P (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), E (position 3), S (position 4).
- **O** and **S** are new untested letters that are common. If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities.

This guess is consistent with all previous feedback and leverages the current knowledge efficiently. If incorrect, the response (e.g., feedback for O and S) will further define the solution space.

<guess>pores</guess>",pores,"We have two guesses and their feedback:

First guess: crane
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R is in the word but not at position 2 (index 1)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word but not at position 5 (index 4)

Second guess: peril
- P: ✓ (correct position) → So the first letter of the secret word is P.
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word but not at position 2 (index 1). Also, from first guess, we know E is not at position 5 (index 4).
- R: ✓ (correct position) → So the third letter of the secret word is R.
- I: x (not in word)
- L: x (not in word)

What we know so far:
- The secret word starts with P and has R as the third letter: P _ R _ _
- E is in the word, but not at position 2 (from peril feedback) and not at position 5 (from crane feedback). The possible positions for E are now positions 1 (if we consider index starting at 0) or 4? But note positions: 
  Index 0: P (fixed)
  Index 1: second letter → E cannot be here because in peril, E was at index 1 and got ""-"" meaning it's not there.
  Index 2: R (fixed)
  Index 3: fourth letter
  Index 4: fifth letter → E cannot be here (from crane)

So E must be at position 4? Wait, index 4 is the fifth letter? The positions are:
  0: P (first letter)
  1: second letter → E is not here (from peril)
  2: R (third letter)
  3: fourth letter
  4: fifth letter → E is not here? But from crane, E was at index 4 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So E must be at one of the other positions? But position 0 is fixed to P? Position 2 is fixed to R? So E must be at position 3? Because positions 0,2 are fixed and 1 and 4 are ruled out for E.

Let me clarify:
- The secret word is 5 letters: positions 0,1,2,3,4.
- We know:
  - Position 0: P (from peril's P✓)
  - Position 2: R (from peril's R✓)
- From crane: E is in the word but not at position 4? Actually, crane had E at position 4? Or at the fifth position which is index 4? So E is not at index 4.
- From peril: E is at index 1 and got ""-"", so not at index 1.

Therefore, E must be at either index 0? But index0 is P, so not E? Or index 3? That's the only position left: indices 0,1,2 are occupied? Index0 is P, index2 is R? Index1 and index1 is out? So index3 is the fourth letter? And index4 the fifth?

So positions available: index3 and index4? But index4 is ruled out for E? Therefore, E must be at index3? But index3 is the fourth letter? Yes.

So: the secret word has P at start, then some letter at position1, then R at position2, then E at position3? And then a letter at position4? But we know from crane that E is in the word? Yes.

Additionally, from crane we have R at index1 and it was ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at index1? But now we know R is at index2? So that's consistent? And E at index3? Which wasn't present in crane? Because in crane E was at index4? So index3 wasn't tested? So that's fine.

Therefore, we have: P _ R E _ 

The word must be of the form: P? R E ? 

Now, what about the missing letters? We know:
- C, A, N, I, L are not in the word? From first guess: C, A, N out. From second: I and L out.
- E is at position3? 
- We have two positions: position1 and position4.

Moreover, what letters are present? We know R and E and P? Also, from crane feedback, we had R and E indicated? So the secret word must have R and E? Yes.

What about position1? We must choose a letter that hasn't been eliminated? And that is not any of: C, A, N, I, L? And also, we haven't tested any other letters? Well, we also know that in crane, the first letter C was out? Then peril had P, E, R, I, L? So I and L are out? Therefore, the set of eliminated letters: C, A, N, I, L? 

Still many letters left? E.g., B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters.

Now, we must form a word: P ? R E ? 

And the fifth letter (index4) is the last one? We don't know? 

But also, we have the R? And E? 

Moreover, we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far? So let's assume no duplicates? Since we haven't been warned? 

Therefore, the letter at position1 and position4 must be distinct? And must not be any of the eliminated ones? 

Also, we know from crane: R was in the word but not at index1? Well, we have R at index2? So position1? We don't know yet? 

Similarly, crane didn't test position3? So E was not at index4? But now we place E at index3? 

So for our next guess, we can test the form: P? R E ? 

But we don't know position1 and position4? 

We can choose a word that fits: P? R E ? 

For example, we can try: PUREM? But not a word? 

Valid English words: 
- PURE? Only 4 letters? Must be 5 letters.
- PURED? Not a word? 
- PURGE? 
  P U R G E -> 
  We have R at index2? The word PURGE: 
    P at0, U at1, R at2, G at3, E at4? 
  But according to our reasoning, E should be at index3? And G would be at index3? Then E at index4? But we thought E must be at index3? 

Wait, this conflicts? Let me reexamine:

We have: 
- Secret word has E in it? 
- Positions where E can be? 
  From peril feedback: E was at index1 and wrong? So E not at index1? 
  From crane feedback: E was at index4 and wrong? So E not at index4? 
  Therefore, E must be at index0? Index0 is P? So impossible? Or at index3? 

But index3: fourth letter? 

For example, in PURE? But again, not 5 letters? 

We need a 5-letter word? So positions: 
0: P 
1: ? 
2: R 
3: ? 
4: ? 

But in our earlier, we concluded E must be at index3? Because we already eliminated index1 and index4? 

But index0 is taken by P? Index2 by R? Only index3 left? So E must be at index3? 

Therefore, the word is: P ? R E ? 

And the last letter at index4? 

Therefore, structure: P, then a letter at1, then R, then E, then a letter at4? 

Now, examples of English words: 
- PREY? Only 4 letters? 
- PRESS? 
  But structure: P, R, E, S, S -> but positions: 
    0:P, 1:R? Wait no: we have R at position2? In PRESS: 
      P(0), R(1), E(2), S(3), S(4)? 
  But we require R at position2 (index2)? So cannot be at index1? 

We need the R at index2? And E at index3? So:
Positions: 
0: P
1: ? 
2: R 
3: E 
4: ?

So the word must be: ? P (1st letter)? R (3rd letter)? E (4th letter) and last letter? 

So possible words: 
- PRE? D? -> PREED? Not a word?
- PREST? 
  P, R, E, S, T -> but that has E at index2? We need E at index3? 

Actually, we need: 
Position 0: P 
Position 1: ? (a letter we don't know) 
Position 2: R 
Position 3: E 
Position 4: ? 

So we have letters: P, ?, R, E, ? 

Now, valid English words: 
- PROSE? 
  P, R, O, S, E -> that’s P(0), R(2)? Wait, positions: 
  0: P
  1: R? -> but R is at index1? We need R at index2? Instead, it has O at index2? 

So no? 

- PRICE? But I is eliminated? I is out? Peril had I and it was x? 

- PRUDE? 
  P, R, U, D, E -> structure: 
  0: P
  1: R? at1? But we need R at index2? Instead, it has U at2? 

We need R at index2? Meaning the third letter is R? 

Examples: 
- PRE? E? Not easy? 

Another word: PRI? E? But I out? 

Possible words: 
- PROBE? 
  P, R, O, B, E -> E is at index4? But that's invalid? Because we know E not at index4? 

But in PROBE: E is at the end? Index4? We cannot have E there? 

- PRONE? 
  P, R, O, N, E -> but N is eliminated from first guess? N is out? 

- PROSE? E at end? No? 

What about: 
- PRIME? But I is out? 
- PRATE? A is out? 
- PROVE? 
  P, R, O, V, E -> E at index4? Disallowed? 

But again, E not at4.

Therefore, the only possibility is to have E at index3? And then we need a word with form: P, (letter), R, E, (letter)

Valid English words? 
- PERSE? Not common? 
- WORDS: PRE? Let me list:
  One common word: P R E S T? Prest is not common?
  Another: *PRESET? 6 letters?
  5-letter words with pattern P?RE?

Perhaps: 
- PURSE: P, U, R, S, E -> 
  Positions: 
  0: P
  1: U
  2: R -> yes
  3: S -> but E? At index4? But we need E at index3? In PURSE, index3 is S? Index4 is E? -> but E at index4? Which we cannot have? 

Unless our initial reasoning was wrong? 

Therefore, we must reconsider the position of E? 

Reexamine feedback:

First guess: crane -> 
  Positions: 
    0: C -> x
    1: R -> -
    2: A -> x
    3: N -> x
    4: E -> -
  Meaning: 
    C, A, N not in word? 
    R in word, not at index1? 
    E in word, not at index4? 

Second guess: peril? 
  Positions: 
    0: P -> ✓ → P correct at index0? 
    1: E -> - → E in word, not at index1? 
    2: R -> ✓ → R correct at index2? 
    3: I -> x
    4: L -> x

Now, we have:
- The secret word has P at0? R at2? 
- And E must be in the word? But where? 
From peril, E was guessed at index1? And given ""-"", so E is in the word but not at index1? 
From crane, E was at index4? And given ""-"", so E in word but not at index4? 

Therefore, the only possibilities are index3? Since index0,2 are fixed? And index1,4 ruled out? 

But index3: the fourth letter? 

Therefore, the secret word must be: 
  P at0, ? at1, R at2, E at3, ? at4? 

And such word exists? 

Examples: 
- FRE? E? 
Not easy? Few ones:

- PRE?D: Not common? 
- SPREE? 
  S,P,R,E,E? That’s 5 letters: 
    0: S? -> not P? 

But we must start with P? 

Therefore, the only word that comes to mind is: ""PUREE""? 
PUREE: P, U, R, E, E? 
But positions:
  0: P? OK?
  1: U? 
  2: R? OK? 
  3: E? OK? 
  4: E? 

And E at index3? Yes? And E at index4? But we have two E's? And it is a word?

And feedback: 
From crane: E at index4 was given ""-"", meaning the secret word has an E but not at position4? In a word with two E's? It could be? The E is present? So our guess crane had E at4? Which is not the position of E? Because E is at3? But if there's another E at4? Then the first guess would have shown E at4 as correct? Because it is present? But crane's E at index4 got a dash? Meaning it is in the word but not at that position? If the secret word has an E at4, then crane's E at4 would have been ✓? 

Therefore, for crane's guess:
- If the secret word had an E at the fifth position (like in puree)? Then the feedback for E would be ✓? But crane got ""-""? So if secret word is puree, then crane's E at4? It should be matched? But feedback was ""-"" meaning it's not at that position? Hence, secret word cannot have E at index4? Even if there is another E? 

So puree has E at index3 and index4? 
- The E at index4? Is present? So in crane's guess, when we put E at4? It would be correct if secret has an E at4? 

But in crane, we got ""-"" for E, meaning: the secret has an E, but not at position4? So even though there may be an E at4 in the secret? The feedback would have been ""✓"" if there were an E at that position? Because it's a match? 

But crane's E at4 got ""-"", so that indicates that the secret does not have E at4? 

In puree, there is an E at4? So crane's E at4 would have been ✓? But the feedback was ""-"" for E at4? Therefore, puree cannot be the word? 

Similarly, any word with E at4 is disallowed? 

Therefore, our structure must be P? R E ? with E only at index3? And not at4? 

Another possibility: ""PREDY""? but not common? 

Or ""PRENT""? But N out? 

Or ""PRESA""? Not 5 letters? 

I'm struggling? Let's consider that our deduction about the position of E might be correct, but the word is rare? 

Alternatively, perhaps there are other words? 

Another word: ""PROKE""? Or ""PRUME""? Not valid? 

Valid English words: 
- ""pure""? but 4 letters? 
- ""press""? has E at2? 
- ""price""? has I? Out? 
- ""prase""? But A out? 
- ""prime""? I out? 
- ""prose""? has O? And E at4? But disallowed? 
- ""prove""? E at4? 
- ""prude""? E at4? 

The only one I can think of is ""PREED""? But not valid? 

But wait, there is ""PREED"" in some dictionaries? But let's avoid? 

Another idea: perhaps we missed that in the first guess, crane had R at index1? And got ""-""? And in peril we have R at index2 and got ""✓""? So R is fixed at index2? 

Also, E cannot be at index1 or index4? 

But what if the word has E at index0? But index0 is P? So not? 

Therefore, index3 is the only possibility? 

Then we must have a 5-letter word: letter1 at index1? And letter2 at index4? 

So: P, X, R, E, Y? 

And X and Y are letters not eliminated? And not C,A,N,I,L? 

Moreover, the word must be valid? 

Examples: 
- ""PER I E S""? No? 
- ""PRESENT"" is 6 letters? 
- ""PRED""? No? 

Let me search: 
  BRED? Not starting with P? 
  CRED? No? 
  DRED? No? 
  FRED? No? 
  GRED? Not a word? 
  PIRED? But I out? 
  TRED? 
  But no? 

Another: PARSE? A out? 

PORED? O? And E at4? 

 But E at4 disallowed? 

Then ""PORES""? has O? and E at4? 

Same issue? 

Perhaps ""PORKY""? No E? 

But we need E? 

Therefore, maybe our deduction is incorrect? 

Another possibility: in peril, the? Maybe E is at a different position? But peril's feedback showed E as ""-"", so it is in the word? How else? 

Perhaps the word has duplicate E's? For example, at different positions? 

But we've ruled out index1 and index4 for E? So only index3? 

But let's brainstorm words: 
  PIRE? No?
  PER?? But then E at1? And peril has E at1? But got ""-"", so E not at1? 

Therefore, the only remaining is that E must be at index3? 

And the last letter at index4? So we have to guess a word that has P, then a letter, then R, then E, then a letter? 

One common word: ""PREZA""? Not? 
Another: ""PHREV""? Not? 

Perhaps ""PRED""? Not 5? 
""PRES"" not 5? 
""PREST"" has E at2? 

But we need E at3? 

Example: ""PRET"" not 5?

Another: ""GREET"" not P? 

""FREED"" not P? 

""BREED"" not P? 

 Then what? 

Perhaps ""PRI E D""? But I out? 

Then ""PROBE"" E at4? 

Disallowed? 

Unless the feedback for E in crane means that for crane's guess at position4, it is not E it is something else? But E is still in the word? 

But the structure must have P, X, R, E, Y? 

Valid word: ""PAR E S""? A out? 

""PURE""? 4 letters? 

""PURELY"" 6 letters? 

So perhaps "" puree"" is accepted? Even though it has E at the end? But crane feedback conflict? 

Or another word: ""P R E E N""? 6 letters? 

""PRET""? No? 

Perhaps we got the positions wrong? 

Let's double-check indices:

For peril:
  P (index0), E (index1), R (index2), I (index3), L (index4)

Feedback:
  P(0) ✓ -> P correct at0
  E(1) - -> E in word but not at1
  R(2) ✓ -> R correct at2
  I(3) x? But if the secret has E at3? Then why not? 

But in peril's feedback, index3 was I and it was x? And we are assuming E is at3? So in secret at3 is E? So peril's I was mismatched? 

But for the secret word, pattern PxREx? 

And peril at index3 was I? Which is not correct? 

Now, new guess: we know almost the word is P? R E? 

But we don't know the first blank and the last blank? 

We can try a guess that fits and tests potential letters? 

For example, choose a word that has the form P* R E *? With * being new letters? 

For example, ""PR EED"" not valid? 

""PRED?"" no? 

""PR E S T"" but then E is at index2? Not index3? 

Alternatively to test, perhaps ""PRE E"" is not possible? 

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""PREED"" but it's not valid in some dictionaries? 

But let's consider common words: 
  5 letters, start with P, third letter R, fourth letter E? 

Upon checking words: 
- PREED? Not common? 
- PREEN? Yes, ""preen"" is a word: P, R, E, E, N? But problem: נN is out? First guess had N as x? And ""preen"" has N at the end? So cannot? 

- PRESS? P, R, E, S, S? Fifth letter S? But positions: 
  P(0), R(1), E(2), S(3), S(4) -> but we need R at index2? This has R at index1? And E at index2? So does not match our structure? 

Unless our indices are off? 

Position0: P? 
Position1: first blank? 
Position2: R? 
Position3: E? 
Position4: last blank? 

In ""PRESS"": 
  P at0, R at1, E at2, S at3, S at4? 
  -> R at index1? But we need R at index2? -> does not satisfy? 

What about: ""PRUDE""? P, R, U, D, E? -> same issue? R at index1? 

But our requirement is R at index2? 

To have R at index2? and P at0? then index1 can be any letter? 

For example, ""PORES"": P, O, R, E, S? 
This is: 
  P at0
  O at1
  R at2? -> yes
  E at3? -> Wait, in ""PORES"", fourth letter is E? Which would be index3? 
  S at4? 
Perfect? And ""PORES"" is a word? 

Now, does it match feedback? 
First, crane: 
  crane has R at index1? But in pores, R is at index2? So match ""-"" because R is present but not at the position guessed? 
  crane had E at index4? But in pores, E is at index3? And there's no E at index4? Since last letter is S? So E present but not at index4? So feedback for E in crane is ""-"" is correct? 

Peril: 
  For peril, we have:
    P✓ -> correct, first letter P? 
    E at index1: O at index1 in pores is not E? But E is in the word? At index3? So peril's E at index1 should be marked as ""-""? And it was? 
    R at index2: R is at index2 in pores? So marked ""✓"" which matches? 
    I at index3: in peril? And in secret, index3 is E? So not I? marked ""x"" is correct? 
    L at index4: secret has S? So not L? ""x"" correct? 

So ""PORES"" fits? 

And in guess2, peril's feedback: I and L are out? 

So secret word can be ""PORES""?
 But pores: P O R E S -> positions:
  0: P
  1: O
  2: R
  3: E
  4: S

And we have:
- P at0: yes
- O at1: we didn't know? Now we know?
- R at2: yes
- E at3: yes
- S at4: yes

And feedback matches? 

Therefore, our next guess can be ""PORES"" in hopes of getting it? 

But we are to guess? 

But also, there might be other words? Like ""PARES"", but A out? ""PURES""? U? ""PORES"" is one? 

Another word: ""PRIES"" but I out? 

""PKUES?"" not valid? 

So ""PORES"" or "" Pomes"" (P O M E S) but then R is not there? 

But we know R is in the word? 

In PORES, we have O and S as new letters? 

But in our next guess, since we have limited tries? We can guess PORES? 

But we are at guess3? We have 4 tries left? 

Since we strongly suspect PORES? But let's not jump? We can use a guess that might give more information? 

But if we think PORES fits, we can try it? 

Perhaps another word: ""P R E S T"" but E at2? Doesn't fit? 

 The only word I can think of is ""PORES"" or "" P R E E N"" but N out? 

 Therefore, I think ""PORES"" is a good guess? 

But earlier we deduced that E must be at index3? And R at2? 

So <guess>pores</guess>? 

But let's confirm: in our structure, E is at index3? In ""PORES"" yes: index0:P,1:O,2:R,3:E,4:S? 

So E at3? Index3 is the fourth letter? Yes.After analyzing the previous feedback, the following conclusions are drawn:

1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (crane):**
   - C (position 0) ❌: Not in the word.
   - R (position 1) ➖: In the word but wrong position.
   - A (position 2) ❌: Not in the word.
   - N (position 3) ❌: Not in the word.
   - E (position 4) ➖: In the word but wrong position.

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (peril):**
   - P (position 0) ✅: Correct and in position.
   - E (position 1) ➖: In the word but wrong position.
   - R (position 2) ✅: Correct and in position.
   - I (position 3) ❌: Not in the word.
   - L (position 4) ❌: Not in the word.

### Key Deductions:
- The word starts with **P** (from peril's ✅ feedback).
- The third letter is **R** (from peril's ✅ feedback).
- **E** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (as per ➖ feedback from peril and crane). This leaves **position 3 (index 3)** as the only possible location for E.
- Eliminated letters: **C**, **A**, **N**, **I**, **L** (confirmed ❌ from feedback).
- The secret word structure is: **P _ R E _**, where:
  - Position 0: P (fixed).
  - Position 1: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, I, or L).
  - Position 2: R (fixed).
  - Position 3: E (deduced from constraints).
  - Position 4: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, I, or L).

### Strategy for This Guess:
- Test a valid word that fits the structure **P _ R E _**.
- Prioritize common letters for positions 1 and 4 to maximize information.
- After reviewing possible words, the word **PORES** fits all constraints:
  - P (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), E (position 3), S (position 4).
- **O** and **S** are new untested letters that are common. If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities.

This guess is consistent with all previous feedback and leverages the current knowledge efficiently. If incorrect, the response (e.g., feedback for O and S) will further define the solution space.",Guess 3: pores -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(x) R(✓) E(✓) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,purer,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the word ""crane"" with feedback:
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: x -> not in the word
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The letters C, A, N are NOT in the secret word.
 - The letter R is in the word but not in the second position.
 - The letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

 Also, since the word is 5 letters, and R and E are present but not in their guessed positions.

 Our goal is to come up with a new guess that incorporates this feedback.

 We must choose a word that:
 - Does NOT contain C, A, N.
 - Contains R and E (at least).
 - The R cannot be in the second position (index 1) and E cannot be in the fifth position (index 4).

 Additionally, since R and E are present, we can try to place them in other positions.

 Let me think of common English words that fit these constraints.

 We have R that must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4 (since index 1 is excluded, note: indexing starts at 0? But in the feedback, positions are: index0: C, index1: R, index2: A, index3: N, index4: E).

 Actually, the feedback positions are:
 Position 0: C -> x
 Position 1: R -> - (meaning R is elsewhere)
 Position 2: A -> x
 Position 3: N -> x
 Position 4: E -> - (meaning E is elsewhere)

 Therefore, in our next guess:
 - We should avoid putting R at position 1 and E at position 4.
 - We should also include R and E somewhere else.

 Moreover, we don't know if there are any other letters that might be in the word.

 A good approach is to try a word that uses other common letters and places R and E in new positions.

 Since we eliminated C, A, N, we have many letters left. We can try to use more vowels and common consonants.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc. Vowels: O, I, U possibly.

 Let me try to form a word containing R and E but without C, A, N.

 Example: We could try ""ROGUE"" but let's check:
 - R at position 0 -> acceptable? But note R was misplaced in position 1 so maybe position 0 is possible.
   However, we don't know if R is at position 0 or not? The feedback doesn't say anything about position 0 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was a dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at position 0, 2, 3, or 4? But wait, we also know E is at position 4 in the previous guess and was misplaced, so E is not at the end? Actually, E can be at any position except 4? Not necessarily: the feedback only says that in the first guess, the E at the fifth position (index4) was wrong. But E might be at another position.

 However, note: in the next guess we can place E at a different position.

 But also, the secret word might have E elsewhere? Yes.

 Now, let me consider the word ""STARE"". However, ""STARE"" has 'A' which we know is not in the word (from feedback: A is x). So avoid A.

 Alternatively, ""STORE"" has S, T, O, R, E. But we haven't eliminated S, T, O. 
 Also, note: in ""STORE"":
 - Positions: 
   0: S
   1: T
   2: O
   3: R
   4: E

 But we have constraints: R was in the word but not at position 1 -> in this guess R is at position 3 (which is acceptable). 
 E was not at position 4 in the secret word? Wait, in the feedback for the first guess, E was at position 4 and it was misplaced, meaning E is in the word but not at position 4. In this guess, we are placing E at position 4 again? That would be a problem because we know E cannot be at position 4. So we cannot put E at position 4 in this guess.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting E at position 4.

 So ""STORE"" is invalid because E is at position 4.

 Let me try ""ROUTE"": R at 0, O, U, T, E at 4 -> again E at 4? No, we cannot do that.

 We need a word with E not at the end? For example, in the middle.

 How about ""TRIBE"": 
 T, R at 1, I, B, E at 4 -> again E at 4? Avoid.

 Alternatively, how about ""SERVE"": 
 S, E at 1, R at 2, V, E at 4 -> E at 1 and 4? But we know E is in the word, so it can appear multiple times? The feedback didn't specify if there are duplicates. However, in the first guess we only had one E and it was misplaced. We don't know if the word has more than one E? So we can consider words with two E's? But let's not overcomplicate: we know at least one E is present, so we must include at least one E somewhere not at the fifth position.

 In ""SERVE"": 
 - Position 0: S -> okay
 - Position 1: E -> okay? But we don't have feedback for E at position 1. Only that it wasn't at position 4.
 - Position 2: R -> okay? Also, R was not supposed to be at position 1 -> here it's at position2, so acceptable.
 - Position 4: E -> avoid! We know E cannot be at position 4.

 So we have to avoid placing E at position 4.

 We need a word that has E in one of the positions 0, 1, 2, 3.

 Example: ""DRIVE"": 
 D, R at 1, I, V, E at 4 -> again E at 4? Not good.

 How about ""PERIL"": 
 P, E at 1, R at 2, I, L -> 
 Positions: 
  0: P
  1: E -> E is at index1 -> acceptable? We don't know if E is at index1 in the secret word.
  2: R -> R at index2 -> acceptable because previously R was at index1 and we know it wasn't there. 
  3: I
  4: L

 This word: PERIL
 - Contains E and R.
 - E is at position1 -> valid since we only know it's not at position4.
 - R is at position2 -> valid because we know it's not at position1.

 Also, we avoid C, A, N.

 It uses other common letters: P, E, R, I, L.

 So this seems like a good candidate.

 We could try other words as well, such as ""REPLY"", but that has Y which is less common. And ""PERIL"" has the advantage of testing two new vowels (I and no other vowel) and a mix.

 Alternatively, let me think: we know that in the secret word, R must be somewhere, and E must be somewhere not at the end. Another word could be ""MERGE"": 
 M, E at1, R at2, G, E at4 -> again E at4? Avoid.

 Or ""BERET"": 
 B, E at1, R at2, E at3, T -> 
 Positions: 
  0: B
  1: E -> okay
  2: R -> okay
  3: E -> okay (and we are testing if E appears twice? But we don't know, so it's acceptable)
  4: T -> but no E at4? Actually, in this word, E is at positions1 and3, not at4.

 However, wait: the fifth letter is T. So E is not at position4. Therefore, it's acceptable.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicates? We might, so we can try words with duplicate E's? But we have eliminated A and N, and C, so E might duplicate? Not sure.

 Alternatively, let's stick with ""PERIL"" because it is a valid word and doesn't have E at the end.

 Another possibility: ""RINSE"". But check: 
 R at0, I, N -> wait, we have N? N was eliminated because in the first guess N was an x -> meaning not in the word. So ""RINSE"" contains N -> cannot be used. So we must avoid N.

 Similarly, avoid A and C and N.

 Therefore, ""PERIL"" doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters.

 Let me confirm: 
 P: we don't know -> okay
 E: we want to include -> okay
 R: we want to include -> okay
 I: unknown -> okay
 L: unknown -> okay

 And positions: E at1, R at2 -> so R is not at1 (good) and E is not at4 (good).

 Therefore, ""PERIL"" is a good second guess.

 Let's consider another word: ""SPIRE"" -> 
 S, P, I, R, E at4 -> but E at4: avoid.

 Another word: ""GIVER"" -> 
 G, I, V, E, R at4 -> R is at4? and E at3? actually: 
 positions: 
  0: G
  1: I
  2: V
  3: E -> acceptable for E? we don't know if position3 is allowed? and R at4? but R could be at4? because previously R was only disallowed at position1? so position4 is allowed for R? 
 However, this word ends with R, and we do not know if that's bad? But we haven't eliminated it. Also, E is at position3 -> acceptable because we don't have any feedback that E cannot be at 3? 

 But note: we also don't know if R is allowed at position4? The feedback only said R is not at position1. Position4 is fine.

 However, another issue: the word ""GIVER"" has R at the end? and E at position3? So it might be acceptable? But we have E at position3 and R at position4? Then why stop at PERIL? Both are acceptable.

 However, we also want to cover more common letters? ""PERIL"" uses L, while ""GIVER"" uses V and R. V is less common? So maybe ""PERIL"" is better.

 Let's go with ""PERIL"".

 So the next guess: PERILBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N are not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (index 1)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (index 4)

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E
- Avoid C, A, N
- R cannot be in position 2 (index 1)
- E cannot be in position 5 (index 4)
- Prioritizes common letters to maximize information

The word **PERIL** is chosen because:
- Contains R (placed at position 3, avoiding index 1)
- Contains E (placed at position 2, avoiding index 4)
- Uses P, I, L—common letters not yet tested
- Avoids eliminated letters C, A, N

<guess>peril</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: peril -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) E(-) R(✓) I(x) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

First guess: crane
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R is in the word but not at position 2 (index 1)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word but not at position 5 (index 4)

Second guess: peril
- P: ✓ (correct position) → So the first letter of the secret word is P.
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word but not at position 2 (index 1). Also, from first guess, we know E is not at position 5 (index 4).
- R: ✓ (correct position) → So the third letter of the secret word is R.
- I: x (not in word)
- L: x (not in word)

What we know so far:
- The secret word starts with P and has R as the third letter: P _ R _ _
- E is in the word, but not at position 2 (from peril feedback) and not at position 5 (from crane feedback). The possible positions for E are now positions 1 (if we consider index starting at 0) or 4? But note positions: 
  Index 0: P (fixed)
  Index 1: second letter → E cannot be here because in peril, E was at index 1 and got ""-"" meaning it's not there.
  Index 2: R (fixed)
  Index 3: fourth letter
  Index 4: fifth letter → E cannot be here (from crane)

So E must be at position 4? Wait, index 4 is the fifth letter? The positions are:
  0: P (first letter)
  1: second letter → E is not here (from peril)
  2: R (third letter)
  3: fourth letter
  4: fifth letter → E is not here? But from crane, E was at index 4 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So E must be at one of the other positions? But position 0 is fixed to P? Position 2 is fixed to R? So E must be at position 3? Because positions 0,2 are fixed and 1 and 4 are ruled out for E.

Let me clarify:
- The secret word is 5 letters: positions 0,1,2,3,4.
- We know:
  - Position 0: P (from peril's P✓)
  - Position 2: R (from peril's R✓)
- From crane: E is in the word but not at position 4? Actually, crane had E at position 4? Or at the fifth position which is index 4? So E is not at index 4.
- From peril: E is at index 1 and got ""-"", so not at index 1.

Therefore, E must be at either index 0? But index0 is P, so not E? Or index 3? That's the only position left: indices 0,1,2 are occupied? Index0 is P, index2 is R? Index1 and index1 is out? So index3 is the fourth letter? And index4 the fifth?

So positions available: index3 and index4? But index4 is ruled out for E? Therefore, E must be at index3? But index3 is the fourth letter? Yes.

So: the secret word has P at start, then some letter at position1, then R at position2, then E at position3? And then a letter at position4? But we know from crane that E is in the word? Yes.

Additionally, from crane we have R at index1 and it was ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at index1? But now we know R is at index2? So that's consistent? And E at index3? Which wasn't present in crane? Because in crane E was at index4? So index3 wasn't tested? So that's fine.

Therefore, we have: P _ R E _ 

The word must be of the form: P? R E ? 

Now, what about the missing letters? We know:
- C, A, N, I, L are not in the word? From first guess: C, A, N out. From second: I and L out.
- E is at position3? 
- We have two positions: position1 and position4.

Moreover, what letters are present? We know R and E and P? Also, from crane feedback, we had R and E indicated? So the secret word must have R and E? Yes.

What about position1? We must choose a letter that hasn't been eliminated? And that is not any of: C, A, N, I, L? And also, we haven't tested any other letters? Well, we also know that in crane, the first letter C was out? Then peril had P, E, R, I, L? So I and L are out? Therefore, the set of eliminated letters: C, A, N, I, L? 

Still many letters left? E.g., B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters.

Now, we must form a word: P ? R E ? 

And the fifth letter (index4) is the last one? We don't know? 

But also, we have the R? And E? 

Moreover, we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far? So let's assume no duplicates? Since we haven't been warned? 

Therefore, the letter at position1 and position4 must be distinct? And must not be any of the eliminated ones? 

Also, we know from crane: R was in the word but not at index1? Well, we have R at index2? So position1? We don't know yet? 

Similarly, crane didn't test position3? So E was not at index4? But now we place E at index3? 

So for our next guess, we can test the form: P? R E ? 

But we don't know position1 and position4? 

We can choose a word that fits: P? R E ? 

For example, we can try: PUREM? But not a word? 

Valid English words: 
- PURE? Only 4 letters? Must be 5 letters.
- PURED? Not a word? 
- PURGE? 
  P U R G E -> 
  We have R at index2? The word PURGE: 
    P at0, U at1, R at2, G at3, E at4? 
  But according to our reasoning, E should be at index3? And G would be at index3? Then E at index4? But we thought E must be at index3? 

Wait, this conflicts? Let me reexamine:

We have: 
- Secret word has E in it? 
- Positions where E can be? 
  From peril feedback: E was at index1 and wrong? So E not at index1? 
  From crane feedback: E was at index4 and wrong? So E not at index4? 
  Therefore, E must be at index0? Index0 is P? So impossible? Or at index3? 

But index3: fourth letter? 

For example, in PURE? But again, not 5 letters? 

We need a 5-letter word? So positions: 
0: P 
1: ? 
2: R 
3: ? 
4: ? 

But in our earlier, we concluded E must be at index3? Because we already eliminated index1 and index4? 

But index0 is taken by P? Index2 by R? Only index3 left? So E must be at index3? 

Therefore, the word is: P ? R E ? 

And the last letter at index4? 

Therefore, structure: P, then a letter at1, then R, then E, then a letter at4? 

Now, examples of English words: 
- PREY? Only 4 letters? 
- PRESS? 
  But structure: P, R, E, S, S -> but positions: 
    0:P, 1:R? Wait no: we have R at position2? In PRESS: 
      P(0), R(1), E(2), S(3), S(4)? 
  But we require R at position2 (index2)? So cannot be at index1? 

We need the R at index2? And E at index3? So:
Positions: 
0: P
1: ? 
2: R 
3: E 
4: ?

So the word must be: ? P (1st letter)? R (3rd letter)? E (4th letter) and last letter? 

So possible words: 
- PRE? D? -> PREED? Not a word?
- PREST? 
  P, R, E, S, T -> but that has E at index2? We need E at index3? 

Actually, we need: 
Position 0: P 
Position 1: ? (a letter we don't know) 
Position 2: R 
Position 3: E 
Position 4: ? 

So we have letters: P, ?, R, E, ? 

Now, valid English words: 
- PROSE? 
  P, R, O, S, E -> that’s P(0), R(2)? Wait, positions: 
  0: P
  1: R? -> but R is at index1? We need R at index2? Instead, it has O at index2? 

So no? 

- PRICE? But I is eliminated? I is out? Peril had I and it was x? 

- PRUDE? 
  P, R, U, D, E -> structure: 
  0: P
  1: R? at1? But we need R at index2? Instead, it has U at2? 

We need R at index2? Meaning the third letter is R? 

Examples: 
- PRE? E? Not easy? 

Another word: PRI? E? But I out? 

Possible words: 
- PROBE? 
  P, R, O, B, E -> E is at index4? But that's invalid? Because we know E not at index4? 

But in PROBE: E is at the end? Index4? We cannot have E there? 

- PRONE? 
  P, R, O, N, E -> but N is eliminated from first guess? N is out? 

- PROSE? E at end? No? 

What about: 
- PRIME? But I is out? 
- PRATE? A is out? 
- PROVE? 
  P, R, O, V, E -> E at index4? Disallowed? 

But again, E not at4.

Therefore, the only possibility is to have E at index3? And then we need a word with form: P, (letter), R, E, (letter)

Valid English words? 
- PERSE? Not common? 
- WORDS: PRE? Let me list:
  One common word: P R E S T? Prest is not common?
  Another: *PRESET? 6 letters?
  5-letter words with pattern P?RE?

Perhaps: 
- PURSE: P, U, R, S, E -> 
  Positions: 
  0: P
  1: U
  2: R -> yes
  3: S -> but E? At index4? But we need E at index3? In PURSE, index3 is S? Index4 is E? -> but E at index4? Which we cannot have? 

Unless our initial reasoning was wrong? 

Therefore, we must reconsider the position of E? 

Reexamine feedback:

First guess: crane -> 
  Positions: 
    0: C -> x
    1: R -> -
    2: A -> x
    3: N -> x
    4: E -> -
  Meaning: 
    C, A, N not in word? 
    R in word, not at index1? 
    E in word, not at index4? 

Second guess: peril? 
  Positions: 
    0: P -> ✓ → P correct at index0? 
    1: E -> - → E in word, not at index1? 
    2: R -> ✓ → R correct at index2? 
    3: I -> x
    4: L -> x

Now, we have:
- The secret word has P at0? R at2? 
- And E must be in the word? But where? 
From peril, E was guessed at index1? And given ""-"", so E is in the word but not at index1? 
From crane, E was at index4? And given ""-"", so E in word but not at index4? 

Therefore, the only possibilities are index3? Since index0,2 are fixed? And index1,4 ruled out? 

But index3: the fourth letter? 

Therefore, the secret word must be: 
  P at0, ? at1, R at2, E at3, ? at4? 

And such word exists? 

Examples: 
- FRE? E? 
Not easy? Few ones:

- PRE?D: Not common? 
- SPREE? 
  S,P,R,E,E? That’s 5 letters: 
    0: S? -> not P? 

But we must start with P? 

Therefore, the only word that comes to mind is: ""PUREE""? 
PUREE: P, U, R, E, E? 
But positions:
  0: P? OK?
  1: U? 
  2: R? OK? 
  3: E? OK? 
  4: E? 

And E at index3? Yes? And E at index4? But we have two E's? And it is a word?

And feedback: 
From crane: E at index4 was given ""-"", meaning the secret word has an E but not at position4? In a word with two E's? It could be? The E is present? So our guess crane had E at4? Which is not the position of E? Because E is at3? But if there's another E at4? Then the first guess would have shown E at4 as correct? Because it is present? But crane's E at index4 got a dash? Meaning it is in the word but not at that position? If the secret word has an E at4, then crane's E at4 would have been ✓? 

Therefore, for crane's guess:
- If the secret word had an E at the fifth position (like in puree)? Then the feedback for E would be ✓? But crane got ""-""? So if secret word is puree, then crane's E at4? It should be matched? But feedback was ""-"" meaning it's not at that position? Hence, secret word cannot have E at index4? Even if there is another E? 

So puree has E at index3 and index4? 
- The E at index4? Is present? So in crane's guess, when we put E at4? It would be correct if secret has an E at4? 

But in crane, we got ""-"" for E, meaning: the secret has an E, but not at position4? So even though there may be an E at4 in the secret? The feedback would have been ""✓"" if there were an E at that position? Because it's a match? 

But crane's E at4 got ""-"", so that indicates that the secret does not have E at4? 

In puree, there is an E at4? So crane's E at4 would have been ✓? But the feedback was ""-"" for E at4? Therefore, puree cannot be the word? 

Similarly, any word with E at4 is disallowed? 

Therefore, our structure must be P? R E ? with E only at index3? And not at4? 

Another possibility: ""PREDY""? but not common? 

Or ""PRENT""? But N out? 

Or ""PRESA""? Not 5 letters? 

I'm struggling? Let's consider that our deduction about the position of E might be correct, but the word is rare? 

Alternatively, perhaps there are other words? 

Another word: ""PROKE""? Or ""PRUME""? Not valid? 

Valid English words: 
- ""pure""? but 4 letters? 
- ""press""? has E at2? 
- ""price""? has I? Out? 
- ""prase""? But A out? 
- ""prime""? I out? 
- ""prose""? has O? And E at4? But disallowed? 
- ""prove""? E at4? 
- ""prude""? E at4? 

The only one I can think of is ""PREED""? But not valid? 

But wait, there is ""PREED"" in some dictionaries? But let's avoid? 

Another idea: perhaps we missed that in the first guess, crane had R at index1? And got ""-""? And in peril we have R at index2 and got ""✓""? So R is fixed at index2? 

Also, E cannot be at index1 or index4? 

But what if the word has E at index0? But index0 is P? So not? 

Therefore, index3 is the only possibility? 

Then we must have a 5-letter word: letter1 at index1? And letter2 at index4? 

So: P, X, R, E, Y? 

And X and Y are letters not eliminated? And not C,A,N,I,L? 

Moreover, the word must be valid? 

Examples: 
- ""PER I E S""? No? 
- ""PRESENT"" is 6 letters? 
- ""PRED""? No? 

Let me search: 
  BRED? Not starting with P? 
  CRED? No? 
  DRED? No? 
  FRED? No? 
  GRED? Not a word? 
  PIRED? But I out? 
  TRED? 
  But no? 

Another: PARSE? A out? 

PORED? O? And E at4? 

 But E at4 disallowed? 

Then ""PORES""? has O? and E at4? 

Same issue? 

Perhaps ""PORKY""? No E? 

But we need E? 

Therefore, maybe our deduction is incorrect? 

Another possibility: in peril, the? Maybe E is at a different position? But peril's feedback showed E as ""-"", so it is in the word? How else? 

Perhaps the word has duplicate E's? For example, at different positions? 

But we've ruled out index1 and index4 for E? So only index3? 

But let's brainstorm words: 
  PIRE? No?
  PER?? But then E at1? And peril has E at1? But got ""-"", so E not at1? 

Therefore, the only remaining is that E must be at index3? 

And the last letter at index4? So we have to guess a word that has P, then a letter, then R, then E, then a letter? 

One common word: ""PREZA""? Not? 
Another: ""PHREV""? Not? 

Perhaps ""PRED""? Not 5? 
""PRES"" not 5? 
""PREST"" has E at2? 

But we need E at3? 

Example: ""PRET"" not 5?

Another: ""GREET"" not P? 

""FREED"" not P? 

""BREED"" not P? 

 Then what? 

Perhaps ""PRI E D""? But I out? 

Then ""PROBE"" E at4? 

Disallowed? 

Unless the feedback for E in crane means that for crane's guess at position4, it is not E it is something else? But E is still in the word? 

But the structure must have P, X, R, E, Y? 

Valid word: ""PAR E S""? A out? 

""PURE""? 4 letters? 

""PURELY"" 6 letters? 

So perhaps "" puree"" is accepted? Even though it has E at the end? But crane feedback conflict? 

Or another word: ""P R E E N""? 6 letters? 

""PRET""? No? 

Perhaps we got the positions wrong? 

Let's double-check indices:

For peril:
  P (index0), E (index1), R (index2), I (index3), L (index4)

Feedback:
  P(0) ✓ -> P correct at0
  E(1) - -> E in word but not at1
  R(2) ✓ -> R correct at2
  I(3) x? But if the secret has E at3? Then why not? 

But in peril's feedback, index3 was I and it was x? And we are assuming E is at3? So in secret at3 is E? So peril's I was mismatched? 

But for the secret word, pattern PxREx? 

And peril at index3 was I? Which is not correct? 

Now, new guess: we know almost the word is P? R E? 

But we don't know the first blank and the last blank? 

We can try a guess that fits and tests potential letters? 

For example, choose a word that has the form P* R E *? With * being new letters? 

For example, ""PR EED"" not valid? 

""PRED?"" no? 

""PR E S T"" but then E is at index2? Not index3? 

Alternatively to test, perhaps ""PRE E"" is not possible? 

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""PREED"" but it's not valid in some dictionaries? 

But let's consider common words: 
  5 letters, start with P, third letter R, fourth letter E? 

Upon checking words: 
- PREED? Not common? 
- PREEN? Yes, ""preen"" is a word: P, R, E, E, N? But problem: נN is out? First guess had N as x? And ""preen"" has N at the end? So cannot? 

- PRESS? P, R, E, S, S? Fifth letter S? But positions: 
  P(0), R(1), E(2), S(3), S(4) -> but we need R at index2? This has R at index1? And E at index2? So does not match our structure? 

Unless our indices are off? 

Position0: P? 
Position1: first blank? 
Position2: R? 
Position3: E? 
Position4: last blank? 

In ""PRESS"": 
  P at0, R at1, E at2, S at3, S at4? 
  -> R at index1? But we need R at index2? -> does not satisfy? 

What about: ""PRUDE""? P, R, U, D, E? -> same issue? R at index1? 

But our requirement is R at index2? 

To have R at index2? and P at0? then index1 can be any letter? 

For example, ""PORES"": P, O, R, E, S? 
This is: 
  P at0
  O at1
  R at2? -> yes
  E at3? -> Wait, in ""PORES"", fourth letter is E? Which would be index3? 
  S at4? 
Perfect? And ""PORES"" is a word? 

Now, does it match feedback? 
First, crane: 
  crane has R at index1? But in pores, R is at index2? So match ""-"" because R is present but not at the position guessed? 
  crane had E at index4? But in pores, E is at index3? And there's no E at index4? Since last letter is S? So E present but not at index4? So feedback for E in crane is ""-"" is correct? 

Peril: 
  For peril, we have:
    P✓ -> correct, first letter P? 
    E at index1: O at index1 in pores is not E? But E is in the word? At index3? So peril's E at index1 should be marked as ""-""? And it was? 
    R at index2: R is at index2 in pores? So marked ""✓"" which matches? 
    I at index3: in peril? And in secret, index3 is E? So not I? marked ""x"" is correct? 
    L at index4: secret has S? So not L? ""x"" correct? 

So ""PORES"" fits? 

And in guess2, peril's feedback: I and L are out? 

So secret word can be ""PORES""?
 But pores: P O R E S -> positions:
  0: P
  1: O
  2: R
  3: E
  4: S

And we have:
- P at0: yes
- O at1: we didn't know? Now we know?
- R at2: yes
- E at3: yes
- S at4: yes

And feedback matches? 

Therefore, our next guess can be ""PORES"" in hopes of getting it? 

But we are to guess? 

But also, there might be other words? Like ""PARES"", but A out? ""PURES""? U? ""PORES"" is one? 

Another word: ""PRIES"" but I out? 

""PKUES?"" not valid? 

So ""PORES"" or "" Pomes"" (P O M E S) but then R is not there? 

But we know R is in the word? 

In PORES, we have O and S as new letters? 

But in our next guess, since we have limited tries? We can guess PORES? 

But we are at guess3? We have 4 tries left? 

Since we strongly suspect PORES? But let's not jump? We can use a guess that might give more information? 

But if we think PORES fits, we can try it? 

Perhaps another word: ""P R E S T"" but E at2? Doesn't fit? 

 The only word I can think of is ""PORES"" or "" P R E E N"" but N out? 

 Therefore, I think ""PORES"" is a good guess? 

But earlier we deduced that E must be at index3? And R at2? 

So <guess>pores</guess>? 

But let's confirm: in our structure, E is at index3? In ""PORES"" yes: index0:P,1:O,2:R,3:E,4:S? 

So E at3? Index3 is the fourth letter? Yes.After analyzing the previous feedback, the following conclusions are drawn:

1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (crane):**
   - C (position 0) ❌: Not in the word.
   - R (position 1) ➖: In the word but wrong position.
   - A (position 2) ❌: Not in the word.
   - N (position 3) ❌: Not in the word.
   - E (position 4) ➖: In the word but wrong position.

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (peril):**
   - P (position 0) ✅: Correct and in position.
   - E (position 1) ➖: In the word but wrong position.
   - R (position 2) ✅: Correct and in position.
   - I (position 3) ❌: Not in the word.
   - L (position 4) ❌: Not in the word.

### Key Deductions:
- The word starts with **P** (from peril's ✅ feedback).
- The third letter is **R** (from peril's ✅ feedback).
- **E** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (as per ➖ feedback from peril and crane). This leaves **position 3 (index 3)** as the only possible location for E.
- Eliminated letters: **C**, **A**, **N**, **I**, **L** (confirmed ❌ from feedback).
- The secret word structure is: **P _ R E _**, where:
  - Position 0: P (fixed).
  - Position 1: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, I, or L).
  - Position 2: R (fixed).
  - Position 3: E (deduced from constraints).
  - Position 4: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, I, or L).

### Strategy for This Guess:
- Test a valid word that fits the structure **P _ R E _**.
- Prioritize common letters for positions 1 and 4 to maximize information.
- After reviewing possible words, the word **PORES** fits all constraints:
  - P (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), E (position 3), S (position 4).
- **O** and **S** are new untested letters that are common. If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities.

This guess is consistent with all previous feedback and leverages the current knowledge efficiently. If incorrect, the response (e.g., feedback for O and S) will further define the solution space.

We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.\n A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.\n Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.\n\n After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). \n This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.\n\n So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given the word ""crane"" with feedback:\n C: x -> not in the word\n R: - -> in the word but wrong position\n A: x -> not in the word\n N: x -> not in the word\n E: - -> in the word but wrong position\n\n So, from this feedback, we know:\n - The letters C, A, N are NOT in the secret word.\n - The letter R is in the word but not in the second position.\n - The letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position.\n\n Also, since the word is 5 letters, and R and E are present but not in their guessed positions.\n\n Our goal is to come up with a new guess that incorporates this feedback.\n\n We must choose a word that:\n - Does NOT contain C, A, N.\n - Contains R and E (at least).\n - The R cannot be in the second position (index 1) and E cannot be in the fifth position (index 4).\n\n Additionally, since R and E are present, we can try to place them in other positions.\n\n Let me think of common English words that fit these constraints.\n\n We have R that must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4 (since index 1 is excluded, note: indexing starts at 0? But in the feedback, positions are: index0: C, index1: R, index2: A, index3: N, index4: E).\n\n Actually, the feedback positions are:\n Position 0: C -> x\n Position 1: R -> - (meaning R is elsewhere)\n Position 2: A -> x\n Position 3: N -> x\n Position 4: E -> - (meaning E is elsewhere)\n\n Therefore, in our next guess:\n - We should avoid putting R at position 1 and E at position 4.\n - We should also include R and E somewhere else.\n\n Moreover, we don\'t know if there are any other letters that might be in the word.\n\n A good approach is to try a word that uses other common letters and places R and E in new positions.\n\n Since we eliminated C, A, N, we have many letters left. We can try to use more vowels and common consonants.\n\n Common consonants: S, T, L, etc. Vowels: O, I, U possibly.\n\n Let me try to form a word containing R and E but without C, A, N.\n\n Example: We could try ""ROGUE"" but let\'s check:\n - R at position 0 -> acceptable? But note R was misplaced in position 1 so maybe position 0 is possible.\n   However, we don\'t know if R is at position 0 or not? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about position 0 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was a dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at position 0, 2, 3, or 4? But wait, we also know E is at position 4 in the previous guess and was misplaced, so E is not at the end? Actually, E can be at any position except 4? Not necessarily: the feedback only says that in the first guess, the E at the fifth position (index4) was wrong. But E might be at another position.\n\n However, note: in the next guess we can place E at a different position.\n\n But also, the secret word might have E elsewhere? Yes.\n\n Now, let me consider the word ""STARE"". However, ""STARE"" has \'A\' which we know is not in the word (from feedback: A is x). So avoid A.\n\n Alternatively, ""STORE"" has S, T, O, R, E. But we haven\'t eliminated S, T, O. \n Also, note: in ""STORE"":\n - Positions: \n   0: S\n   1: T\n   2: O\n   3: R\n   4: E\n\n But we have constraints: R was in the word but not at position 1 -> in this guess R is at position 3 (which is acceptable). \n E was not at position 4 in the secret word? Wait, in the feedback for the first guess, E was at position 4 and it was misplaced, meaning E is in the word but not at position 4. In this guess, we are placing E at position 4 again? That would be a problem because we know E cannot be at position 4. So we cannot put E at position 4 in this guess.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting E at position 4.\n\n So ""STORE"" is invalid because E is at position 4.\n\n Let me try ""ROUTE"": R at 0, O, U, T, E at 4 -> again E at 4? No, we cannot do that.\n\n We need a word with E not at the end? For example, in the middle.\n\n How about ""TRIBE"": \n T, R at 1, I, B, E at 4 -> again E at 4? Avoid.\n\n Alternatively, how about ""SERVE"": \n S, E at 1, R at 2, V, E at 4 -> E at 1 and 4? But we know E is in the word, so it can appear multiple times? The feedback didn\'t specify if there are duplicates. However, in the first guess we only had one E and it was misplaced. We don\'t know if the word has more than one E? So we can consider words with two E\'s? But let\'s not overcomplicate: we know at least one E is present, so we must include at least one E somewhere not at the fifth position.\n\n In ""SERVE"": \n - Position 0: S -> okay\n - Position 1: E -> okay? But we don\'t have feedback for E at position 1. Only that it wasn\'t at position 4.\n - Position 2: R -> okay? Also, R was not supposed to be at position 1 -> here it\'s at position2, so acceptable.\n - Position 4: E -> avoid! We know E cannot be at position 4.\n\n So we have to avoid placing E at position 4.\n\n We need a word that has E in one of the positions 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n Example: ""DRIVE"": \n D, R at 1, I, V, E at 4 -> again E at 4? Not good.\n\n How about ""PERIL"": \n P, E at 1, R at 2, I, L -> \n Positions: \n  0: P\n  1: E -> E is at index1 -> acceptable? We don\'t know if E is at index1 in the secret word.\n  2: R -> R at index2 -> acceptable because previously R was at index1 and we know it wasn\'t there. \n  3: I\n  4: L\n\n This word: PERIL\n - Contains E and R.\n - E is at position1 -> valid since we only know it\'s not at position4.\n - R is at position2 -> valid because we know it\'s not at position1.\n\n Also, we avoid C, A, N.\n\n It uses other common letters: P, E, R, I, L.\n\n So this seems like a good candidate.\n\n We could try other words as well, such as ""REPLY"", but that has Y which is less common. And ""PERIL"" has the advantage of testing two new vowels (I and no other vowel) and a mix.\n\n Alternatively, let me think: we know that in the secret word, R must be somewhere, and E must be somewhere not at the end. Another word could be ""MERGE"": \n M, E at1, R at2, G, E at4 -> again E at4? Avoid.\n\n Or ""BERET"": \n B, E at1, R at2, E at3, T -> \n Positions: \n  0: B\n  1: E -> okay\n  2: R -> okay\n  3: E -> okay (and we are testing if E appears twice? But we don\'t know, so it\'s acceptable)\n  4: T -> but no E at4? Actually, in this word, E is at positions1 and3, not at4.\n\n However, wait: the fifth letter is T. So E is not at position4. Therefore, it\'s acceptable.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates? We might, so we can try words with duplicate E\'s? But we have eliminated A and N, and C, so E might duplicate? Not sure.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s stick with ""PERIL"" because it is a valid word and doesn\'t have E at the end.\n\n Another possibility: ""RINSE"". But check: \n R at0, I, N -> wait, we have N? N was eliminated because in the first guess N was an x -> meaning not in the word. So ""RINSE"" contains N -> cannot be used. So we must avoid N.\n\n Similarly, avoid A and C and N.\n\n Therefore, ""PERIL"" doesn\'t contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\n Let me confirm: \n P: we don\'t know -> okay\n E: we want to include -> okay\n R: we want to include -> okay\n I: unknown -> okay\n L: unknown -> okay\n\n And positions: E at1, R at2 -> so R is not at1 (good) and E is not at4 (good).\n\n Therefore, ""PERIL"" is a good second guess.\n\n Let\'s consider another word: ""SPIRE"" -> \n S, P, I, R, E at4 -> but E at4: avoid.\n\n Another word: ""GIVER"" -> \n G, I, V, E, R at4 -> R is at4? and E at3? actually: \n positions: \n  0: G\n  1: I\n  2: V\n  3: E -> acceptable for E? we don\'t know if position3 is allowed? and R at4? but R could be at4? because previously R was only disallowed at position1? so position4 is allowed for R? \n However, this word ends with R, and we do not know if that\'s bad? But we haven\'t eliminated it. Also, E is at position3 -> acceptable because we don\'t have any feedback that E cannot be at 3? \n\n But note: we also don\'t know if R is allowed at position4? The feedback only said R is not at position1. Position4 is fine.\n\n However, another issue: the word ""GIVER"" has R at the end? and E at position3? So it might be acceptable? But we have E at position3 and R at position4? Then why stop at PERIL? Both are acceptable.\n\n However, we also want to cover more common letters? ""PERIL"" uses L, while ""GIVER"" uses V and R. V is less common? So maybe ""PERIL"" is better.\n\n Let\'s go with ""PERIL"".\n\n So the next guess: PERILBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N are not in the word (x)\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (index 1)\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (index 4)\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and E\n- Avoid C, A, N\n- R cannot be in position 2 (index 1)\n- E cannot be in position 5 (index 4)\n- Prioritizes common letters to maximize information\n\nThe word **PERIL** is chosen because:\n- Contains R (placed at position 3, avoiding index 1)\n- Contains E (placed at position 2, avoiding index 4)\n- Uses P, I, L—common letters not yet tested\n- Avoids eliminated letters C, A, N\n\n<guess>peril</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: peril -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) E(-) R(✓) I(x) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\nFirst guess: crane\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R is in the word but not at position 2 (index 1)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word but not at position 5 (index 4)\n\nSecond guess: peril\n- P: ✓ (correct position) → So the first letter of the secret word is P.\n- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word but not at position 2 (index 1). Also, from first guess, we know E is not at position 5 (index 4).\n- R: ✓ (correct position) → So the third letter of the secret word is R.\n- I: x (not in word)\n- L: x (not in word)\n\nWhat we know so far:\n- The secret word starts with P and has R as the third letter: P _ R _ _\n- E is in the word, but not at position 2 (from peril feedback) and not at position 5 (from crane feedback). The possible positions for E are now positions 1 (if we consider index starting at 0) or 4? But note positions: \n  Index 0: P (fixed)\n  Index 1: second letter → E cannot be here because in peril, E was at index 1 and got ""-"" meaning it\'s not there.\n  Index 2: R (fixed)\n  Index 3: fourth letter\n  Index 4: fifth letter → E cannot be here (from crane)\n\nSo E must be at position 4? Wait, index 4 is the fifth letter? The positions are:\n  0: P (first letter)\n  1: second letter → E is not here (from peril)\n  2: R (third letter)\n  3: fourth letter\n  4: fifth letter → E is not here? But from crane, E was at index 4 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So E must be at one of the other positions? But position 0 is fixed to P? Position 2 is fixed to R? So E must be at position 3? Because positions 0,2 are fixed and 1 and 4 are ruled out for E.\n\nLet me clarify:\n- The secret word is 5 letters: positions 0,1,2,3,4.\n- We know:\n  - Position 0: P (from peril\'s P✓)\n  - Position 2: R (from peril\'s R✓)\n- From crane: E is in the word but not at position 4? Actually, crane had E at position 4? Or at the fifth position which is index 4? So E is not at index 4.\n- From peril: E is at index 1 and got ""-"", so not at index 1.\n\nTherefore, E must be at either index 0? But index0 is P, so not E? Or index 3? That\'s the only position left: indices 0,1,2 are occupied? Index0 is P, index2 is R? Index1 and index1 is out? So index3 is the fourth letter? And index4 the fifth?\n\nSo positions available: index3 and index4? But index4 is ruled out for E? Therefore, E must be at index3? But index3 is the fourth letter? Yes.\n\nSo: the secret word has P at start, then some letter at position1, then R at position2, then E at position3? And then a letter at position4? But we know from crane that E is in the word? Yes.\n\nAdditionally, from crane we have R at index1 and it was ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at index1? But now we know R is at index2? So that\'s consistent? And E at index3? Which wasn\'t present in crane? Because in crane E was at index4? So index3 wasn\'t tested? So that\'s fine.\n\nTherefore, we have: P _ R E _ \n\nThe word must be of the form: P? R E ? \n\nNow, what about the missing letters? We know:\n- C, A, N, I, L are not in the word? From first guess: C, A, N out. From second: I and L out.\n- E is at position3? \n- We have two positions: position1 and position4.\n\nMoreover, what letters are present? We know R and E and P? Also, from crane feedback, we had R and E indicated? So the secret word must have R and E? Yes.\n\nWhat about position1? We must choose a letter that hasn\'t been eliminated? And that is not any of: C, A, N, I, L? And also, we haven\'t tested any other letters? Well, we also know that in crane, the first letter C was out? Then peril had P, E, R, I, L? So I and L are out? Therefore, the set of eliminated letters: C, A, N, I, L? \n\nStill many letters left? E.g., B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters.\n\nNow, we must form a word: P ? R E ? \n\nAnd the fifth letter (index4) is the last one? We don\'t know? \n\nBut also, we have the R? And E? \n\nMoreover, we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven\'t seen any duplicates so far? So let\'s assume no duplicates? Since we haven\'t been warned? \n\nTherefore, the letter at position1 and position4 must be distinct? And must not be any of the eliminated ones? \n\nAlso, we know from crane: R was in the word but not at index1? Well, we have R at index2? So position1? We don\'t know yet? \n\nSimilarly, crane didn\'t test position3? So E was not at index4? But now we place E at index3? \n\nSo for our next guess, we can test the form: P? R E ? \n\nBut we don\'t know position1 and position4? \n\nWe can choose a word that fits: P? R E ? \n\nFor example, we can try: PUREM? But not a word? \n\nValid English words: \n- PURE? Only 4 letters? Must be 5 letters.\n- PURED? Not a word? \n- PURGE? \n  P U R G E -> \n  We have R at index2? The word PURGE: \n    P at0, U at1, R at2, G at3, E at4? \n  But according to our reasoning, E should be at index3? And G would be at index3? Then E at index4? But we thought E must be at index3? \n\nWait, this conflicts? Let me reexamine:\n\nWe have: \n- Secret word has E in it? \n- Positions where E can be? \n  From peril feedback: E was at index1 and wrong? So E not at index1? \n  From crane feedback: E was at index4 and wrong? So E not at index4? \n  Therefore, E must be at index0? Index0 is P? So impossible? Or at index3? \n\nBut index3: fourth letter? \n\nFor example, in PURE? But again, not 5 letters? \n\nWe need a 5-letter word? So positions: \n0: P \n1: ? \n2: R \n3: ? \n4: ? \n\nBut in our earlier, we concluded E must be at index3? Because we already eliminated index1 and index4? \n\nBut index0 is taken by P? Index2 by R? Only index3 left? So E must be at index3? \n\nTherefore, the word is: P ? R E ? \n\nAnd the last letter at index4? \n\nTherefore, structure: P, then a letter at1, then R, then E, then a letter at4? \n\nNow, examples of English words: \n- PREY? Only 4 letters? \n- PRESS? \n  But structure: P, R, E, S, S -> but positions: \n    0:P, 1:R? Wait no: we have R at position2? In PRESS: \n      P(0), R(1), E(2), S(3), S(4)? \n  But we require R at position2 (index2)? So cannot be at index1? \n\nWe need the R at index2? And E at index3? So:\nPositions: \n0: P\n1: ? \n2: R \n3: E \n4: ?\n\nSo the word must be: ? P (1st letter)? R (3rd letter)? E (4th letter) and last letter? \n\nSo possible words: \n- PRE? D? -> PREED? Not a word?\n- PREST? \n  P, R, E, S, T -> but that has E at index2? We need E at index3? \n\nActually, we need: \nPosition 0: P \nPosition 1: ? (a letter we don\'t know) \nPosition 2: R \nPosition 3: E \nPosition 4: ? \n\nSo we have letters: P, ?, R, E, ? \n\nNow, valid English words: \n- PROSE? \n  P, R, O, S, E -> that’s P(0), R(2)? Wait, positions: \n  0: P\n  1: R? -> but R is at index1? We need R at index2? Instead, it has O at index2? \n\nSo no? \n\n- PRICE? But I is eliminated? I is out? Peril had I and it was x? \n\n- PRUDE? \n  P, R, U, D, E -> structure: \n  0: P\n  1: R? at1? But we need R at index2? Instead, it has U at2? \n\nWe need R at index2? Meaning the third letter is R? \n\nExamples: \n- PRE? E? Not easy? \n\nAnother word: PRI? E? But I out? \n\nPossible words: \n- PROBE? \n  P, R, O, B, E -> E is at index4? But that\'s invalid? Because we know E not at index4? \n\nBut in PROBE: E is at the end? Index4? We cannot have E there? \n\n- PRONE? \n  P, R, O, N, E -> but N is eliminated from first guess? N is out? \n\n- PROSE? E at end? No? \n\nWhat about: \n- PRIME? But I is out? \n- PRATE? A is out? \n- PROVE? \n  P, R, O, V, E -> E at index4? Disallowed? \n\nBut again, E not at4.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is to have E at index3? And then we need a word with form: P, (letter), R, E, (letter)\n\nValid English words? \n- PERSE? Not common? \n- WORDS: PRE? Let me list:\n  One common word: P R E S T? Prest is not common?\n  Another: *PRESET? 6 letters?\n  5-letter words with pattern P?RE?\n\nPerhaps: \n- PURSE: P, U, R, S, E -> \n  Positions: \n  0: P\n  1: U\n  2: R -> yes\n  3: S -> but E? At index4? But we need E at index3? In PURSE, index3 is S? Index4 is E? -> but E at index4? Which we cannot have? \n\nUnless our initial reasoning was wrong? \n\nTherefore, we must reconsider the position of E? \n\nReexamine feedback:\n\nFirst guess: crane -> \n  Positions: \n    0: C -> x\n    1: R -> -\n    2: A -> x\n    3: N -> x\n    4: E -> -\n  Meaning: \n    C, A, N not in word? \n    R in word, not at index1? \n    E in word, not at index4? \n\nSecond guess: peril? \n  Positions: \n    0: P -> ✓ → P correct at index0? \n    1: E -> - → E in word, not at index1? \n    2: R -> ✓ → R correct at index2? \n    3: I -> x\n    4: L -> x\n\nNow, we have:\n- The secret word has P at0? R at2? \n- And E must be in the word? But where? \nFrom peril, E was guessed at index1? And given ""-"", so E is in the word but not at index1? \nFrom crane, E was at index4? And given ""-"", so E in word but not at index4? \n\nTherefore, the only possibilities are index3? Since index0,2 are fixed? And index1,4 ruled out? \n\nBut index3: the fourth letter? \n\nTherefore, the secret word must be: \n  P at0, ? at1, R at2, E at3, ? at4? \n\nAnd such word exists? \n\nExamples: \n- FRE? E? \nNot easy? Few ones:\n\n- PRE?D: Not common? \n- SPREE? \n  S,P,R,E,E? That’s 5 letters: \n    0: S? -> not P? \n\nBut we must start with P? \n\nTherefore, the only word that comes to mind is: ""PUREE""? \nPUREE: P, U, R, E, E? \nBut positions:\n  0: P? OK?\n  1: U? \n  2: R? OK? \n  3: E? OK? \n  4: E? \n\nAnd E at index3? Yes? And E at index4? But we have two E\'s? And it is a word?\n\nAnd feedback: \nFrom crane: E at index4 was given ""-"", meaning the secret word has an E but not at position4? In a word with two E\'s? It could be? The E is present? So our guess crane had E at4? Which is not the position of E? Because E is at3? But if there\'s another E at4? Then the first guess would have shown E at4 as correct? Because it is present? But crane\'s E at index4 got a dash? Meaning it is in the word but not at that position? If the secret word has an E at4, then crane\'s E at4 would have been ✓? \n\nTherefore, for crane\'s guess:\n- If the secret word had an E at the fifth position (like in puree)? Then the feedback for E would be ✓? But crane got ""-""? So if secret word is puree, then crane\'s E at4? It should be matched? But feedback was ""-"" meaning it\'s not at that position? Hence, secret word cannot have E at index4? Even if there is another E? \n\nSo puree has E at index3 and index4? \n- The E at index4? Is present? So in crane\'s guess, when we put E at4? It would be correct if secret has an E at4? \n\nBut in crane, we got ""-"" for E, meaning: the secret has an E, but not at position4? So even though there may be an E at4 in the secret? The feedback would have been ""✓"" if there were an E at that position? Because it\'s a match? \n\nBut crane\'s E at4 got ""-"", so that indicates that the secret does not have E at4? \n\nIn puree, there is an E at4? So crane\'s E at4 would have been ✓? But the feedback was ""-"" for E at4? Therefore, puree cannot be the word? \n\nSimilarly, any word with E at4 is disallowed? \n\nTherefore, our structure must be P? R E ? with E only at index3? And not at4? \n\nAnother possibility: ""PREDY""? but not common? \n\nOr ""PRENT""? But N out? \n\nOr ""PRESA""? Not 5 letters? \n\nI\'m struggling? Let\'s consider that our deduction about the position of E might be correct, but the word is rare? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other words? \n\nAnother word: ""PROKE""? Or ""PRUME""? Not valid? \n\nValid English words: \n- ""pure""? but 4 letters? \n- ""press""? has E at2? \n- ""price""? has I? Out? \n- ""prase""? But A out? \n- ""prime""? I out? \n- ""prose""? has O? And E at4? But disallowed? \n- ""prove""? E at4? \n- ""prude""? E at4? \n\nThe only one I can think of is ""PREED""? But not valid? \n\nBut wait, there is ""PREED"" in some dictionaries? But let\'s avoid? \n\nAnother idea: perhaps we missed that in the first guess, crane had R at index1? And got ""-""? And in peril we have R at index2 and got ""✓""? So R is fixed at index2? \n\nAlso, E cannot be at index1 or index4? \n\nBut what if the word has E at index0? But index0 is P? So not? \n\nTherefore, index3 is the only possibility? \n\nThen we must have a 5-letter word: letter1 at index1? And letter2 at index4? \n\nSo: P, X, R, E, Y? \n\nAnd X and Y are letters not eliminated? And not C,A,N,I,L? \n\nMoreover, the word must be valid? \n\nExamples: \n- ""PER I E S""? No? \n- ""PRESENT"" is 6 letters? \n- ""PRED""? No? \n\nLet me search: \n  BRED? Not starting with P? \n  CRED? No? \n  DRED? No? \n  FRED? No? \n  GRED? Not a word? \n  PIRED? But I out? \n  TRED? \n  But no? \n\nAnother: PARSE? A out? \n\nPORED? O? And E at4? \n\n But E at4 disallowed? \n\nThen ""PORES""? has O? and E at4? \n\nSame issue? \n\nPerhaps ""PORKY""? No E? \n\nBut we need E? \n\nTherefore, maybe our deduction is incorrect? \n\nAnother possibility: in peril, the? Maybe E is at a different position? But peril\'s feedback showed E as ""-"", so it is in the word? How else? \n\nPerhaps the word has duplicate E\'s? For example, at different positions? \n\nBut we\'ve ruled out index1 and index4 for E? So only index3? \n\nBut let\'s brainstorm words: \n  PIRE? No?\n  PER?? But then E at1? And peril has E at1? But got ""-"", so E not at1? \n\nTherefore, the only remaining is that E must be at index3? \n\nAnd the last letter at index4? So we have to guess a word that has P, then a letter, then R, then E, then a letter? \n\nOne common word: ""PREZA""? Not? \nAnother: ""PHREV""? Not? \n\nPerhaps ""PRED""? Not 5? \n""PRES"" not 5? \n""PREST"" has E at2? \n\nBut we need E at3? \n\nExample: ""PRET"" not 5?\n\nAnother: ""GREET"" not P? \n\n""FREED"" not P? \n\n""BREED"" not P? \n\n Then what? \n\nPerhaps ""PRI E D""? But I out? \n\nThen ""PROBE"" E at4? \n\nDisallowed? \n\nUnless the feedback for E in crane means that for crane\'s guess at position4, it is not E it is something else? But E is still in the word? \n\nBut the structure must have P, X, R, E, Y? \n\nValid word: ""PAR E S""? A out? \n\n""PURE""? 4 letters? \n\n""PURELY"" 6 letters? \n\nSo perhaps "" puree"" is accepted? Even though it has E at the end? But crane feedback conflict? \n\nOr another word: ""P R E E N""? 6 letters? \n\n""PRET""? No? \n\nPerhaps we got the positions wrong? \n\nLet\'s double-check indices:\n\nFor peril:\n  P (index0), E (index1), R (index2), I (index3), L (index4)\n\nFeedback:\n  P(0) ✓ -> P correct at0\n  E(1) - -> E in word but not at1\n  R(2) ✓ -> R correct at2\n  I(3) x? But if the secret has E at3? Then why not? \n\nBut in peril\'s feedback, index3 was I and it was x? And we are assuming E is at3? So in secret at3 is E? So peril\'s I was mismatched? \n\nBut for the secret word, pattern PxREx? \n\nAnd peril at index3 was I? Which is not correct? \n\nNow, new guess: we know almost the word is P? R E? \n\nBut we don\'t know the first blank and the last blank? \n\nWe can try a guess that fits and tests potential letters? \n\nFor example, choose a word that has the form P* R E *? With * being new letters? \n\nFor example, ""PR EED"" not valid? \n\n""PRED?"" no? \n\n""PR E S T"" but then E is at index2? Not index3? \n\nAlternatively to test, perhaps ""PRE E"" is not possible? \n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word is ""PREED"" but it\'s not valid in some dictionaries? \n\nBut let\'s consider common words: \n  5 letters, start with P, third letter R, fourth letter E? \n\nUpon checking words: \n- PREED? Not common? \n- PREEN? Yes, ""preen"" is a word: P, R, E, E, N? But problem: נN is out? First guess had N as x? And ""preen"" has N at the end? So cannot? \n\n- PRESS? P, R, E, S, S? Fifth letter S? But positions: \n  P(0), R(1), E(2), S(3), S(4) -> but we need R at index2? This has R at index1? And E at index2? So does not match our structure? \n\nUnless our indices are off? \n\nPosition0: P? \nPosition1: first blank? \nPosition2: R? \nPosition3: E? \nPosition4: last blank? \n\nIn ""PRESS"": \n  P at0, R at1, E at2, S at3, S at4? \n  -> R at index1? But we need R at index2? -> does not satisfy? \n\nWhat about: ""PRUDE""? P, R, U, D, E? -> same issue? R at index1? \n\nBut our requirement is R at index2? \n\nTo have R at index2? and P at0? then index1 can be any letter? \n\nFor example, ""PORES"": P, O, R, E, S? \nThis is: \n  P at0\n  O at1\n  R at2? -> yes\n  E at3? -> Wait, in ""PORES"", fourth letter is E? Which would be index3? \n  S at4? \nPerfect? And ""PORES"" is a word? \n\nNow, does it match feedback? \nFirst, crane: \n  crane has R at index1? But in pores, R is at index2? So match ""-"" because R is present but not at the position guessed? \n  crane had E at index4? But in pores, E is at index3? And there\'s no E at index4? Since last letter is S? So E present but not at index4? So feedback for E in crane is ""-"" is correct? \n\nPeril: \n  For peril, we have:\n    P✓ -> correct, first letter P? \n    E at index1: O at index1 in pores is not E? But E is in the word? At index3? So peril\'s E at index1 should be marked as ""-""? And it was? \n    R at index2: R is at index2 in pores? So marked ""✓"" which matches? \n    I at index3: in peril? And in secret, index3 is E? So not I? marked ""x"" is correct? \n    L at index4: secret has S? So not L? ""x"" correct? \n\nSo ""PORES"" fits? \n\nAnd in guess2, peril\'s feedback: I and L are out? \n\nSo secret word can be ""PORES""?\n But pores: P O R E S -> positions:\n  0: P\n  1: O\n  2: R\n  3: E\n  4: S\n\nAnd we have:\n- P at0: yes\n- O at1: we didn\'t know? Now we know?\n- R at2: yes\n- E at3: yes\n- S at4: yes\n\nAnd feedback matches? \n\nTherefore, our next guess can be ""PORES"" in hopes of getting it? \n\nBut we are to guess? \n\nBut also, there might be other words? Like ""PARES"", but A out? ""PURES""? U? ""PORES"" is one? \n\nAnother word: ""PRIES"" but I out? \n\n""PKUES?"" not valid? \n\nSo ""PORES"" or "" Pomes"" (P O M E S) but then R is not there? \n\nBut we know R is in the word? \n\nIn PORES, we have O and S as new letters? \n\nBut in our next guess, since we have limited tries? We can guess PORES? \n\nBut we are at guess3? We have 4 tries left? \n\nSince we strongly suspect PORES? But let\'s not jump? We can use a guess that might give more information? \n\nBut if we think PORES fits, we can try it? \n\nPerhaps another word: ""P R E S T"" but E at2? Doesn\'t fit? \n\n The only word I can think of is ""PORES"" or "" P R E E N"" but N out? \n\n Therefore, I think ""PORES"" is a good guess? \n\nBut earlier we deduced that E must be at index3? And R at2? \n\nSo <guess>pores</guess>? \n\nBut let\'s confirm: in our structure, E is at index3? In ""PORES"" yes: index0:P,1:O,2:R,3:E,4:S? \n\nSo E at3? Index3 is the fourth letter? Yes.After analyzing the previous feedback, the following conclusions are drawn:\n\n1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (crane):**\n   - C (position 0) ❌: Not in the word.\n   - R (position 1) ➖: In the word but wrong position.\n   - A (position 2) ❌: Not in the word.\n   - N (position 3) ❌: Not in the word.\n   - E (position 4) ➖: In the word but wrong position.\n\n2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (peril):**\n   - P (position 0) ✅: Correct and in position.\n   - E (position 1) ➖: In the word but wrong position.\n   - R (position 2) ✅: Correct and in position.\n   - I (position 3) ❌: Not in the word.\n   - L (position 4) ❌: Not in the word.\n\n### Key Deductions:\n- The word starts with **P** (from peril\'s ✅ feedback).\n- The third letter is **R** (from peril\'s ✅ feedback).\n- **E** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (as per ➖ feedback from peril and crane). This leaves **position 3 (index 3)** as the only possible location for E.\n- Eliminated letters: **C**, **A**, **N**, **I**, **L** (confirmed ❌ from feedback).\n- The secret word structure is: **P _ R E _**, where:\n  - Position 0: P (fixed).\n  - Position 1: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, I, or L).\n  - Position 2: R (fixed).\n  - Position 3: E (deduced from constraints).\n  - Position 4: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, I, or L).\n\n### Strategy for This Guess:\n- Test a valid word that fits the structure **P _ R E _**.\n- Prioritize common letters for positions 1 and 4 to maximize information.\n- After reviewing possible words, the word **PORES** fits all constraints:\n  - P (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), E (position 3), S (position 4).\n- **O** and **S** are new untested letters that are common. If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities.\n\nThis guess is consistent with all previous feedback and leverages the current knowledge efficiently. If incorrect, the response (e.g., feedback for O and S) will further define the solution space.\n\n<guess>pores</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: peril -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) E(-) R(✓) I(x) L(x)\nGuess 3: pores -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(x) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: peril
- P: ✓ (correct and in position)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: ✓ (correct and in position)
- I: x (not in word)
- L: x (not in word)

Guess 3: pores
- P: ✓ (correct and in position)
- O: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in position)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position)
- S: x (not in word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word starts with P (from peril and pores both having P✓ at position 0).
2. The third letter is R (from peril and pores both having R✓ at position 2).
3. The fourth letter is E (from pores having E✓ at position 3).
4. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, I, L, O, S (from the x's in all guesses).

Additionally, from guess 1 (crane):
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1). But now we know R is at position 2, so that's consistent.
- E is in the word but not at position 4 (index 4). Now we know E is at position 3, so that's also consistent.

The current known structure of the word is: P _ R E _

We are missing the second letter (position 1) and the fifth letter (position 4).

We also know that the second letter cannot be any of the eliminated letters: C, A, N, I, L, O, S. Similarly, the fifth letter cannot be these either.

Moreover, from guess 2 (peril), we had E at position 1 (index 1) and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at that position. We now know E is at position 3, so that's fine.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: P ? R E ? 

The missing letters (at position 1 and 4) must be letters that have not been eliminated and are not in the set {C, A, N, I, L, O, S}.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's list possible letters for position 1 and 4. The remaining letters (consonants and vowels) that are not eliminated:

Vowels left: U (since A, E, I, O are either used or eliminated; E is already placed, A, I, O are eliminated, so U is the only vowel left? But we have Y as well sometimes).

Actually, vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We have:
- A: eliminated (from crane)
- E: in word, placed at position 3
- I: eliminated (from peril)
- O: eliminated (from pores)
- U: not tested yet
- Y: not tested yet

Consonants: We have eliminated C, N, L, S. So available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P (but P is already used at start), Q, R (used at position 2), T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: R is already used at position 2, but it might appear again? The feedback hasn't indicated duplicates, but we don't know for sure. Similarly, E is at position 3, but might there be another E? We don't have evidence of duplicates so far.

Given the constraints, we can try to form words:

Possible words of the form P ? R E ? 

- PRUDE: P, R, U, D, E -> but this has R at position 1? No, PRUDE: P(0), R(1), U(2), D(3), E(4) -> but we need R at position 2 and E at position 3? So structure doesn't match.

We need: position0: P, position1: ?, position2: R, position3: E, position4: ?

So:
- Position0: P
- Position1: ? (unknown)
- Position2: R
- Position3: E
- Position4: ? 

Now, what words fit?

- PREXY? Not a word.
- PREDY? Not common.
- PREY? Only 4 letters.

Common words:
- PREED? Not common, and has E at 3 and 4? But we have E at 3, and if we put E at 4, then from crane we know E is not at 4? So PREED would have E at 4, which is disallowed by crane's feedback? Because crane had E at 4 and got '-', meaning E is not at 4.

So we cannot have E at 4.

Therefore, the fifth letter must not be E? And must be a new letter.

Another word: ""PRUNE""? But N is eliminated? And U at position1? 
PRUNE: P, R, U, N, E -> but N is eliminated? And structure: P(0), R(1), U(2), N(3), E(4) -> doesn't match because we need R at 2 and E at 3? Here R is at 1 and E at 4? Not matching.

We need R at position2 and E at position3.

So the only common word I can think of is ""PREYS""? But PREYS: P, R, E, Y, S -> 
P(0), R(1), E(2), Y(3), S(4) -> but we need R at position2? Here R is at1? And E at2? But we need E at3? So not matching.

Wait, what about ""PURE""? 4 letters.

""PURED""? Not a word.

""PURET""? Not common.

""PURGE""? P, U, R, G, E -> 
P(0), U(1), R(2), G(3), E(4) -> 
This has R at position2? Yes? 
But E at position4? And we know from crane that E is not at position4? So it would be invalid? 

But in PURGE, E is at4? And crane had E at4 and got '-', so secret word cannot have E at4? Therefore, PURGE is invalid.

Another possibility: ""PRESE""? But S is eliminated? And E at4? 

""PRETE""? Not common.

""PRETZ""? Not a word.

""PREVE""? Not common.

I am considering that the only common word that fits is ""PREXY"" but not valid.

Perhaps we missed a word: ""PRICE"" but I is eliminated.

""PRIDE"" -> I is eliminated? And structure: P(0), R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4) -> doesn't match.

""PRIME"" -> I eliminated.

""PRONE"" -> N eliminated and O is also eliminated? And E at4.

""PROSE"" -> O eliminated and E at4.

""PROVE"" -> O eliminated and E at4.

""PRUDE"" -> as before, structure doesn't match.

""PRUNE"" -> N eliminated.

""PRESA"" -> not 5 letters? And A eliminated.

Then what? 

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""P R E E N"" but N eliminated and 5 letters? Preen: P, R, E, E, N -> 
P(0), R(1), E(2), E(3), N(4) -> 
But we need R at position2? Here R is at1? And E at2 and3? But we need E at3? And N at4 is eliminated? So not.

But note: in preen, position2 is E? But we need R at position2? So not.

Perhaps we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any indication.

Alternatively, maybe our deduction that E must be at position3 is incorrect? But let's recheck:

- E is in the word (from crane and peril).
- E cannot be at position1 (from peril: E at1 was marked '-')? 
- E cannot be at position4 (from crane: E at4 was marked '-')? 
- Position0 is P (fixed)? 
- Position2 is R (fixed)? 
- Therefore, the only position left for E is position3? 

So it must be position3? 

Then the word must be P ? R E ? 

And the only common word I can think of is ""PURE"" but it's 4 letters? 

Or ""PURET"" which is not common? 

Another word: ""PZREK"" not valid.

Perhaps ""PYREX""? But that's 5 letters: P, Y, R, E, X? 
Positions: 
0: P
1: Y
2: R
3: E
4: X

And ""PYREX"" is a valid word (a brand, but also a word for heat-resistant glass).

Now, check against feedback:

- Letters: Y and X are new, not eliminated.
- Structure matches: P, Y, R, E, X.

Now, check with previous feedback:

Guess 1: crane
- C: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- R: in PYREX at position2, but in crane it was at position1 -> so '-' is correct (in word but wrong position).
- A: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- N: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- E: in PYREX at position3, but in crane at position4 -> '-' correct.

Guess 2: peril
- P: at0 -> ✓ correct.
- E: in PYREX at position3, but in peril at position1 -> '-' correct.
- R: at2 -> ✓ correct.
- I: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- L: not in PYREX -> x correct.

Guess 3: pores
- P: ✓ correct.
- O: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- R: ✓ correct.
- E: ✓ correct (at position3).
- S: not in PYREX -> x correct.

So ""PYREX"" fits all feedback.

Therefore, we can guess ""PYREX"".

But is it a valid word? Yes, it is accepted in word games as a proper noun, but sometimes allowed. If not, we might need an alternative.

Another common word? ""PREED"" is not common, but ""PYREX"" is more common in this context.

Alternatively, ""BREED"" not starting with P.

So I think ""PYREX"" is a good guess.

Therefore, we'll go with that.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, the following is deduced:

- **Secret word structure**: The word starts with ""P"" (from Guess 2 and 3), has ""R"" in the third position (index 2), and ""E"" in the fourth position (index 3). This gives the pattern: `P _ R E _`.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, I, L, O, S (marked ❌ in feedback).
- **Key constraints**:
  - The second letter (position 1) and fifth letter (position 4) must be letters not eliminated.
  - ""E"" cannot be in position 1 or 4 (per feedback from Guess 1 and 2), which is consistent with the current pattern.
  - ""R"" cannot be in position 1 (per Guess 1), which is satisfied.

The only common English word fitting `P _ R E _` with the eliminated letters excluded is **PYREX**:
- P (position 0), Y (position 1), R (position 2), E (position 3), X (position 4).
- ""Y"" and ""X"" are new, untested letters that are not eliminated.

This guess tests the remaining unknowns efficiently. If incorrect, the feedback will reveal the status of ""Y"" and ""X"", narrowing the solution to very few possibilities.

2. The third letter is R (from peril and pores both having R✓ at position 2).
3. The fourth letter is E (from pores having E✓ at position 3).

Now, we need to find a word that fits: P ? R E ? 

The missing letters (at position 1 and 4) must be letters that have not been eliminated and are not in the set {C, A, N, I, L, O, S}.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's list possible letters for position 1 and 4. The remaining letters (consonants and vowels) that are not eliminated:

But note: R is already used at position 2, but it might appear again? The feedback hasn't indicated duplicates, but we don't know for sure. Similarly, E is at position 3, but might there be another E? We don't have evidence of duplicates so far.

We need: position0: P, position1: ?, position2: R, position3: E, position4: ?

So:
- Position0: P

I am considering that the only common word that fits is ""PREXY"" but not valid.

P(0), R(1), E(2), E(3), N(4) -> 
But we need R at position2? Here R is at1? And E at2 and3? But we need E at3? And N at4 is eliminated? So not.

But note: in preen, position2 is E? But we need R at position2? So not.

Perhaps we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any indication.

Alternatively, maybe our deduction that E must be at position3 is incorrect? But let's recheck:

- E is in the word (from crane and peril).
- E cannot be at position1 (from peril: E at1 was marked '-')? 
- E cannot be at position4 (from crane: E at4 was marked '-')? 
- Position0 is P (fixed)? 
- Position2 is R (fixed)? 
- Therefore, the only position left for E is position3? 

So it must be position3? 

Then the word must be P ? R E ? 

And the only common word I can think of is ""PURE"" but it's 4 letters? 

Or ""PURET"" which is not common? 

Another word: ""PZREK"" not valid.

Perhaps ""PYREX""? But that's 5 letters: P, Y, R, E, X? 
Positions: 
0: P
1: Y
2: R
3: E
4: X

And ""PYREX"" is a valid word (a brand, but also a word for heat-resistant glass).

Now, check against feedback:

- Letters: Y and X are new, not eliminated.
- Structure matches: P, Y, R, E, X.

Now, check with previous feedback:

Guess 1: crane
- C: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- R: in PYREX at position2, but in crane it was at position1 -> so '-' is correct (in word but wrong position).
- A: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- N: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- E: in PYREX at position3, but in crane at position4 -> '-' correct.

Guess 2: peril
- P: at0 -> ✓ correct.
- E: in PYREX at position3, but in peril at position1 -> '-' correct.
- R: at2 -> ✓ correct.
- I: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- L: not in PYREX -> x correct.

Guess 3: pores
- P: ✓ correct.
- O: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- R: ✓ correct.
- E: ✓ correct (at position3).
- S: not in PYREX -> x correct.

So ""PYREX"" fits all feedback.

Therefore, we can guess ""PYREX"".

But is it a valid word? Yes, it is accepted in word games as a proper noun, but sometimes allowed. If not, we might need an alternative.

Another common word? ""PREED"" is not common, but ""PYREX"" is more common in this context.

Alternatively, ""BREED"" not starting with P.

So I think ""PYREX"" is a good guess.

Therefore, we'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses, the following is deduced:

- **Secret word structure**: The word starts with ""P"" (from Guess 2 and 3), has ""R"" in the third position (index 2), and ""E"" in the fourth position (index 3). This gives the pattern: `P _ R E _`.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, I, L, O, S (marked ❌ in feedback).
- **Key constraints**:
  - The second letter (position 1) and fifth letter (position 4) must be letters not eliminated.
  - ""E"" cannot be in position 1 or 4 (per feedback from Guess 1 and 2), which is consistent with the current pattern.
  - ""R"" cannot be in position 1 (per Guess 1), which is satisfied.

The only common English word fitting `P _ R E _` with the eliminated letters excluded is **PYREX**:
- P (position 0), Y (position 1), R (position 2), E (position 3), X (position 4).
- ""Y"" and ""X"" are new, untested letters that are not eliminated.

This guess tests the remaining unknowns efficiently. If incorrect, the feedback will reveal the status of ""Y"" and ""X"", narrowing the solution to very few possibilities.",Guess 4: pyrex -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) Y(x) R(✓) E(✓) X(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,purer,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 After considering, I will start with ""CRANE"". It has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R). 
 This word is also known to be a good starter in Wordle.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given the word ""crane"" with feedback:
 C: x -> not in the word
 R: - -> in the word but wrong position
 A: x -> not in the word
 N: x -> not in the word
 E: - -> in the word but wrong position

 So, from this feedback, we know:
 - The letters C, A, N are NOT in the secret word.
 - The letter R is in the word but not in the second position.
 - The letter E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

 Also, since the word is 5 letters, and R and E are present but not in their guessed positions.

 Our goal is to come up with a new guess that incorporates this feedback.

 We must choose a word that:
 - Does NOT contain C, A, N.
 - Contains R and E (at least).
 - The R cannot be in the second position (index 1) and E cannot be in the fifth position (index 4).

 Additionally, since R and E are present, we can try to place them in other positions.

 Let me think of common English words that fit these constraints.

 We have R that must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4 (since index 1 is excluded, note: indexing starts at 0? But in the feedback, positions are: index0: C, index1: R, index2: A, index3: N, index4: E).

 Actually, the feedback positions are:
 Position 0: C -> x
 Position 1: R -> - (meaning R is elsewhere)
 Position 2: A -> x
 Position 3: N -> x
 Position 4: E -> - (meaning E is elsewhere)

 Therefore, in our next guess:
 - We should avoid putting R at position 1 and E at position 4.
 - We should also include R and E somewhere else.

 Moreover, we don't know if there are any other letters that might be in the word.

 A good approach is to try a word that uses other common letters and places R and E in new positions.

 Since we eliminated C, A, N, we have many letters left. We can try to use more vowels and common consonants.

 Common consonants: S, T, L, etc. Vowels: O, I, U possibly.

 Let me try to form a word containing R and E but without C, A, N.

 Example: We could try ""ROGUE"" but let's check:
 - R at position 0 -> acceptable? But note R was misplaced in position 1 so maybe position 0 is possible.
   However, we don't know if R is at position 0 or not? The feedback doesn't say anything about position 0 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was a dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at position 0, 2, 3, or 4? But wait, we also know E is at position 4 in the previous guess and was misplaced, so E is not at the end? Actually, E can be at any position except 4? Not necessarily: the feedback only says that in the first guess, the E at the fifth position (index4) was wrong. But E might be at another position.

 However, note: in the next guess we can place E at a different position.

 But also, the secret word might have E elsewhere? Yes.

 Now, let me consider the word ""STARE"". However, ""STARE"" has 'A' which we know is not in the word (from feedback: A is x). So avoid A.

 Alternatively, ""STORE"" has S, T, O, R, E. But we haven't eliminated S, T, O. 
 Also, note: in ""STORE"":
 - Positions: 
   0: S
   1: T
   2: O
   3: R
   4: E

 But we have constraints: R was in the word but not at position 1 -> in this guess R is at position 3 (which is acceptable). 
 E was not at position 4 in the secret word? Wait, in the feedback for the first guess, E was at position 4 and it was misplaced, meaning E is in the word but not at position 4. In this guess, we are placing E at position 4 again? That would be a problem because we know E cannot be at position 4. So we cannot put E at position 4 in this guess.

 Therefore, we must avoid putting E at position 4.

 So ""STORE"" is invalid because E is at position 4.

 Let me try ""ROUTE"": R at 0, O, U, T, E at 4 -> again E at 4? No, we cannot do that.

 We need a word with E not at the end? For example, in the middle.

 How about ""TRIBE"": 
 T, R at 1, I, B, E at 4 -> again E at 4? Avoid.

 Alternatively, how about ""SERVE"": 
 S, E at 1, R at 2, V, E at 4 -> E at 1 and 4? But we know E is in the word, so it can appear multiple times? The feedback didn't specify if there are duplicates. However, in the first guess we only had one E and it was misplaced. We don't know if the word has more than one E? So we can consider words with two E's? But let's not overcomplicate: we know at least one E is present, so we must include at least one E somewhere not at the fifth position.

 In ""SERVE"": 
 - Position 0: S -> okay
 - Position 1: E -> okay? But we don't have feedback for E at position 1. Only that it wasn't at position 4.
 - Position 2: R -> okay? Also, R was not supposed to be at position 1 -> here it's at position2, so acceptable.
 - Position 4: E -> avoid! We know E cannot be at position 4.

 So we have to avoid placing E at position 4.

 We need a word that has E in one of the positions 0, 1, 2, 3.

 Example: ""DRIVE"": 
 D, R at 1, I, V, E at 4 -> again E at 4? Not good.

 How about ""PERIL"": 
 P, E at 1, R at 2, I, L -> 
 Positions: 
  0: P
  1: E -> E is at index1 -> acceptable? We don't know if E is at index1 in the secret word.
  2: R -> R at index2 -> acceptable because previously R was at index1 and we know it wasn't there. 
  3: I
  4: L

 This word: PERIL
 - Contains E and R.
 - E is at position1 -> valid since we only know it's not at position4.
 - R is at position2 -> valid because we know it's not at position1.

 Also, we avoid C, A, N.

 It uses other common letters: P, E, R, I, L.

 So this seems like a good candidate.

 We could try other words as well, such as ""REPLY"", but that has Y which is less common. And ""PERIL"" has the advantage of testing two new vowels (I and no other vowel) and a mix.

 Alternatively, let me think: we know that in the secret word, R must be somewhere, and E must be somewhere not at the end. Another word could be ""MERGE"": 
 M, E at1, R at2, G, E at4 -> again E at4? Avoid.

 Or ""BERET"": 
 B, E at1, R at2, E at3, T -> 
 Positions: 
  0: B
  1: E -> okay
  2: R -> okay
  3: E -> okay (and we are testing if E appears twice? But we don't know, so it's acceptable)
  4: T -> but no E at4? Actually, in this word, E is at positions1 and3, not at4.

 However, wait: the fifth letter is T. So E is not at position4. Therefore, it's acceptable.

 But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicates? We might, so we can try words with duplicate E's? But we have eliminated A and N, and C, so E might duplicate? Not sure.

 Alternatively, let's stick with ""PERIL"" because it is a valid word and doesn't have E at the end.

 Another possibility: ""RINSE"". But check: 
 R at0, I, N -> wait, we have N? N was eliminated because in the first guess N was an x -> meaning not in the word. So ""RINSE"" contains N -> cannot be used. So we must avoid N.

 Similarly, avoid A and C and N.

 Therefore, ""PERIL"" doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters.

 Let me confirm: 
 P: we don't know -> okay
 E: we want to include -> okay
 R: we want to include -> okay
 I: unknown -> okay
 L: unknown -> okay

 And positions: E at1, R at2 -> so R is not at1 (good) and E is not at4 (good).

 Therefore, ""PERIL"" is a good second guess.

 Let's consider another word: ""SPIRE"" -> 
 S, P, I, R, E at4 -> but E at4: avoid.

 Another word: ""GIVER"" -> 
 G, I, V, E, R at4 -> R is at4? and E at3? actually: 
 positions: 
  0: G
  1: I
  2: V
  3: E -> acceptable for E? we don't know if position3 is allowed? and R at4? but R could be at4? because previously R was only disallowed at position1? so position4 is allowed for R? 
 However, this word ends with R, and we do not know if that's bad? But we haven't eliminated it. Also, E is at position3 -> acceptable because we don't have any feedback that E cannot be at 3? 

 But note: we also don't know if R is allowed at position4? The feedback only said R is not at position1. Position4 is fine.

 However, another issue: the word ""GIVER"" has R at the end? and E at position3? So it might be acceptable? But we have E at position3 and R at position4? Then why stop at PERIL? Both are acceptable.

 However, we also want to cover more common letters? ""PERIL"" uses L, while ""GIVER"" uses V and R. V is less common? So maybe ""PERIL"" is better.

 Let's go with ""PERIL"".

 So the next guess: PERILBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N are not in the word (x)
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (index 1)
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (index 4)

For the next guess:
- Must include R and E
- Avoid C, A, N
- R cannot be in position 2 (index 1)
- E cannot be in position 5 (index 4)
- Prioritizes common letters to maximize information

The word **PERIL** is chosen because:
- Contains R (placed at position 3, avoiding index 1)
- Contains E (placed at position 2, avoiding index 4)
- Uses P, I, L—common letters not yet tested
- Avoids eliminated letters C, A, N

<guess>peril</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: peril -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) E(-) R(✓) I(x) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

First guess: crane
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R is in the word but not at position 2 (index 1)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word but not at position 5 (index 4)

Second guess: peril
- P: ✓ (correct position) → So the first letter of the secret word is P.
- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word but not at position 2 (index 1). Also, from first guess, we know E is not at position 5 (index 4).
- R: ✓ (correct position) → So the third letter of the secret word is R.
- I: x (not in word)
- L: x (not in word)

What we know so far:
- The secret word starts with P and has R as the third letter: P _ R _ _
- E is in the word, but not at position 2 (from peril feedback) and not at position 5 (from crane feedback). The possible positions for E are now positions 1 (if we consider index starting at 0) or 4? But note positions: 
  Index 0: P (fixed)
  Index 1: second letter → E cannot be here because in peril, E was at index 1 and got ""-"" meaning it's not there.
  Index 2: R (fixed)
  Index 3: fourth letter
  Index 4: fifth letter → E cannot be here (from crane)

So E must be at position 4? Wait, index 4 is the fifth letter? The positions are:
  0: P (first letter)
  1: second letter → E is not here (from peril)
  2: R (third letter)
  3: fourth letter
  4: fifth letter → E is not here? But from crane, E was at index 4 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So E must be at one of the other positions? But position 0 is fixed to P? Position 2 is fixed to R? So E must be at position 3? Because positions 0,2 are fixed and 1 and 4 are ruled out for E.

Let me clarify:
- The secret word is 5 letters: positions 0,1,2,3,4.
- We know:
  - Position 0: P (from peril's P✓)
  - Position 2: R (from peril's R✓)
- From crane: E is in the word but not at position 4? Actually, crane had E at position 4? Or at the fifth position which is index 4? So E is not at index 4.
- From peril: E is at index 1 and got ""-"", so not at index 1.

Therefore, E must be at either index 0? But index0 is P, so not E? Or index 3? That's the only position left: indices 0,1,2 are occupied? Index0 is P, index2 is R? Index1 and index1 is out? So index3 is the fourth letter? And index4 the fifth?

So positions available: index3 and index4? But index4 is ruled out for E? Therefore, E must be at index3? But index3 is the fourth letter? Yes.

So: the secret word has P at start, then some letter at position1, then R at position2, then E at position3? And then a letter at position4? But we know from crane that E is in the word? Yes.

Additionally, from crane we have R at index1 and it was ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at index1? But now we know R is at index2? So that's consistent? And E at index3? Which wasn't present in crane? Because in crane E was at index4? So index3 wasn't tested? So that's fine.

Therefore, we have: P _ R E _ 

The word must be of the form: P? R E ? 

Now, what about the missing letters? We know:
- C, A, N, I, L are not in the word? From first guess: C, A, N out. From second: I and L out.
- E is at position3? 
- We have two positions: position1 and position4.

Moreover, what letters are present? We know R and E and P? Also, from crane feedback, we had R and E indicated? So the secret word must have R and E? Yes.

What about position1? We must choose a letter that hasn't been eliminated? And that is not any of: C, A, N, I, L? And also, we haven't tested any other letters? Well, we also know that in crane, the first letter C was out? Then peril had P, E, R, I, L? So I and L are out? Therefore, the set of eliminated letters: C, A, N, I, L? 

Still many letters left? E.g., B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters.

Now, we must form a word: P ? R E ? 

And the fifth letter (index4) is the last one? We don't know? 

But also, we have the R? And E? 

Moreover, we don't know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any duplicates so far? So let's assume no duplicates? Since we haven't been warned? 

Therefore, the letter at position1 and position4 must be distinct? And must not be any of the eliminated ones? 

Also, we know from crane: R was in the word but not at index1? Well, we have R at index2? So position1? We don't know yet? 

Similarly, crane didn't test position3? So E was not at index4? But now we place E at index3? 

So for our next guess, we can test the form: P? R E ? 

But we don't know position1 and position4? 

We can choose a word that fits: P? R E ? 

For example, we can try: PUREM? But not a word? 

Valid English words: 
- PURE? Only 4 letters? Must be 5 letters.
- PURED? Not a word? 
- PURGE? 
  P U R G E -> 
  We have R at index2? The word PURGE: 
    P at0, U at1, R at2, G at3, E at4? 
  But according to our reasoning, E should be at index3? And G would be at index3? Then E at index4? But we thought E must be at index3? 

Wait, this conflicts? Let me reexamine:

We have: 
- Secret word has E in it? 
- Positions where E can be? 
  From peril feedback: E was at index1 and wrong? So E not at index1? 
  From crane feedback: E was at index4 and wrong? So E not at index4? 
  Therefore, E must be at index0? Index0 is P? So impossible? Or at index3? 

But index3: fourth letter? 

For example, in PURE? But again, not 5 letters? 

We need a 5-letter word? So positions: 
0: P 
1: ? 
2: R 
3: ? 
4: ? 

But in our earlier, we concluded E must be at index3? Because we already eliminated index1 and index4? 

But index0 is taken by P? Index2 by R? Only index3 left? So E must be at index3? 

Therefore, the word is: P ? R E ? 

And the last letter at index4? 

Therefore, structure: P, then a letter at1, then R, then E, then a letter at4? 

Now, examples of English words: 
- PREY? Only 4 letters? 
- PRESS? 
  But structure: P, R, E, S, S -> but positions: 
    0:P, 1:R? Wait no: we have R at position2? In PRESS: 
      P(0), R(1), E(2), S(3), S(4)? 
  But we require R at position2 (index2)? So cannot be at index1? 

We need the R at index2? And E at index3? So:
Positions: 
0: P
1: ? 
2: R 
3: E 
4: ?

So the word must be: ? P (1st letter)? R (3rd letter)? E (4th letter) and last letter? 

So possible words: 
- PRE? D? -> PREED? Not a word?
- PREST? 
  P, R, E, S, T -> but that has E at index2? We need E at index3? 

Actually, we need: 
Position 0: P 
Position 1: ? (a letter we don't know) 
Position 2: R 
Position 3: E 
Position 4: ? 

So we have letters: P, ?, R, E, ? 

Now, valid English words: 
- PROSE? 
  P, R, O, S, E -> that’s P(0), R(2)? Wait, positions: 
  0: P
  1: R? -> but R is at index1? We need R at index2? Instead, it has O at index2? 

So no? 

- PRICE? But I is eliminated? I is out? Peril had I and it was x? 

- PRUDE? 
  P, R, U, D, E -> structure: 
  0: P
  1: R? at1? But we need R at index2? Instead, it has U at2? 

We need R at index2? Meaning the third letter is R? 

Examples: 
- PRE? E? Not easy? 

Another word: PRI? E? But I out? 

Possible words: 
- PROBE? 
  P, R, O, B, E -> E is at index4? But that's invalid? Because we know E not at index4? 

But in PROBE: E is at the end? Index4? We cannot have E there? 

- PRONE? 
  P, R, O, N, E -> but N is eliminated from first guess? N is out? 

- PROSE? E at end? No? 

What about: 
- PRIME? But I is out? 
- PRATE? A is out? 
- PROVE? 
  P, R, O, V, E -> E at index4? Disallowed? 

But again, E not at4.

Therefore, the only possibility is to have E at index3? And then we need a word with form: P, (letter), R, E, (letter)

Valid English words? 
- PERSE? Not common? 
- WORDS: PRE? Let me list:
  One common word: P R E S T? Prest is not common?
  Another: *PRESET? 6 letters?
  5-letter words with pattern P?RE?

Perhaps: 
- PURSE: P, U, R, S, E -> 
  Positions: 
  0: P
  1: U
  2: R -> yes
  3: S -> but E? At index4? But we need E at index3? In PURSE, index3 is S? Index4 is E? -> but E at index4? Which we cannot have? 

Unless our initial reasoning was wrong? 

Therefore, we must reconsider the position of E? 

Reexamine feedback:

First guess: crane -> 
  Positions: 
    0: C -> x
    1: R -> -
    2: A -> x
    3: N -> x
    4: E -> -
  Meaning: 
    C, A, N not in word? 
    R in word, not at index1? 
    E in word, not at index4? 

Second guess: peril? 
  Positions: 
    0: P -> ✓ → P correct at index0? 
    1: E -> - → E in word, not at index1? 
    2: R -> ✓ → R correct at index2? 
    3: I -> x
    4: L -> x

Now, we have:
- The secret word has P at0? R at2? 
- And E must be in the word? But where? 
From peril, E was guessed at index1? And given ""-"", so E is in the word but not at index1? 
From crane, E was at index4? And given ""-"", so E in word but not at index4? 

Therefore, the only possibilities are index3? Since index0,2 are fixed? And index1,4 ruled out? 

But index3: the fourth letter? 

Therefore, the secret word must be: 
  P at0, ? at1, R at2, E at3, ? at4? 

And such word exists? 

Examples: 
- FRE? E? 
Not easy? Few ones:

- PRE?D: Not common? 
- SPREE? 
  S,P,R,E,E? That’s 5 letters: 
    0: S? -> not P? 

But we must start with P? 

Therefore, the only word that comes to mind is: ""PUREE""? 
PUREE: P, U, R, E, E? 
But positions:
  0: P? OK?
  1: U? 
  2: R? OK? 
  3: E? OK? 
  4: E? 

And E at index3? Yes? And E at index4? But we have two E's? And it is a word?

And feedback: 
From crane: E at index4 was given ""-"", meaning the secret word has an E but not at position4? In a word with two E's? It could be? The E is present? So our guess crane had E at4? Which is not the position of E? Because E is at3? But if there's another E at4? Then the first guess would have shown E at4 as correct? Because it is present? But crane's E at index4 got a dash? Meaning it is in the word but not at that position? If the secret word has an E at4, then crane's E at4 would have been ✓? 

Therefore, for crane's guess:
- If the secret word had an E at the fifth position (like in puree)? Then the feedback for E would be ✓? But crane got ""-""? So if secret word is puree, then crane's E at4? It should be matched? But feedback was ""-"" meaning it's not at that position? Hence, secret word cannot have E at index4? Even if there is another E? 

So puree has E at index3 and index4? 
- The E at index4? Is present? So in crane's guess, when we put E at4? It would be correct if secret has an E at4? 

But in crane, we got ""-"" for E, meaning: the secret has an E, but not at position4? So even though there may be an E at4 in the secret? The feedback would have been ""✓"" if there were an E at that position? Because it's a match? 

But crane's E at4 got ""-"", so that indicates that the secret does not have E at4? 

In puree, there is an E at4? So crane's E at4 would have been ✓? But the feedback was ""-"" for E at4? Therefore, puree cannot be the word? 

Similarly, any word with E at4 is disallowed? 

Therefore, our structure must be P? R E ? with E only at index3? And not at4? 

Another possibility: ""PREDY""? but not common? 

Or ""PRENT""? But N out? 

Or ""PRESA""? Not 5 letters? 

I'm struggling? Let's consider that our deduction about the position of E might be correct, but the word is rare? 

Alternatively, perhaps there are other words? 

Another word: ""PROKE""? Or ""PRUME""? Not valid? 

Valid English words: 
- ""pure""? but 4 letters? 
- ""press""? has E at2? 
- ""price""? has I? Out? 
- ""prase""? But A out? 
- ""prime""? I out? 
- ""prose""? has O? And E at4? But disallowed? 
- ""prove""? E at4? 
- ""prude""? E at4? 

The only one I can think of is ""PREED""? But not valid? 

But wait, there is ""PREED"" in some dictionaries? But let's avoid? 

Another idea: perhaps we missed that in the first guess, crane had R at index1? And got ""-""? And in peril we have R at index2 and got ""✓""? So R is fixed at index2? 

Also, E cannot be at index1 or index4? 

But what if the word has E at index0? But index0 is P? So not? 

Therefore, index3 is the only possibility? 

Then we must have a 5-letter word: letter1 at index1? And letter2 at index4? 

So: P, X, R, E, Y? 

And X and Y are letters not eliminated? And not C,A,N,I,L? 

Moreover, the word must be valid? 

Examples: 
- ""PER I E S""? No? 
- ""PRESENT"" is 6 letters? 
- ""PRED""? No? 

Let me search: 
  BRED? Not starting with P? 
  CRED? No? 
  DRED? No? 
  FRED? No? 
  GRED? Not a word? 
  PIRED? But I out? 
  TRED? 
  But no? 

Another: PARSE? A out? 

PORED? O? And E at4? 

 But E at4 disallowed? 

Then ""PORES""? has O? and E at4? 

Same issue? 

Perhaps ""PORKY""? No E? 

But we need E? 

Therefore, maybe our deduction is incorrect? 

Another possibility: in peril, the? Maybe E is at a different position? But peril's feedback showed E as ""-"", so it is in the word? How else? 

Perhaps the word has duplicate E's? For example, at different positions? 

But we've ruled out index1 and index4 for E? So only index3? 

But let's brainstorm words: 
  PIRE? No?
  PER?? But then E at1? And peril has E at1? But got ""-"", so E not at1? 

Therefore, the only remaining is that E must be at index3? 

And the last letter at index4? So we have to guess a word that has P, then a letter, then R, then E, then a letter? 

One common word: ""PREZA""? Not? 
Another: ""PHREV""? Not? 

Perhaps ""PRED""? Not 5? 
""PRES"" not 5? 
""PREST"" has E at2? 

But we need E at3? 

Example: ""PRET"" not 5?

Another: ""GREET"" not P? 

""FREED"" not P? 

""BREED"" not P? 

 Then what? 

Perhaps ""PRI E D""? But I out? 

Then ""PROBE"" E at4? 

Disallowed? 

Unless the feedback for E in crane means that for crane's guess at position4, it is not E it is something else? But E is still in the word? 

But the structure must have P, X, R, E, Y? 

Valid word: ""PAR E S""? A out? 

""PURE""? 4 letters? 

""PURELY"" 6 letters? 

So perhaps "" puree"" is accepted? Even though it has E at the end? But crane feedback conflict? 

Or another word: ""P R E E N""? 6 letters? 

""PRET""? No? 

Perhaps we got the positions wrong? 

Let's double-check indices:

For peril:
  P (index0), E (index1), R (index2), I (index3), L (index4)

Feedback:
  P(0) ✓ -> P correct at0
  E(1) - -> E in word but not at1
  R(2) ✓ -> R correct at2
  I(3) x? But if the secret has E at3? Then why not? 

But in peril's feedback, index3 was I and it was x? And we are assuming E is at3? So in secret at3 is E? So peril's I was mismatched? 

But for the secret word, pattern PxREx? 

And peril at index3 was I? Which is not correct? 

Now, new guess: we know almost the word is P? R E? 

But we don't know the first blank and the last blank? 

We can try a guess that fits and tests potential letters? 

For example, choose a word that has the form P* R E *? With * being new letters? 

For example, ""PR EED"" not valid? 

""PRED?"" no? 

""PR E S T"" but then E is at index2? Not index3? 

Alternatively to test, perhaps ""PRE E"" is not possible? 

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""PREED"" but it's not valid in some dictionaries? 

But let's consider common words: 
  5 letters, start with P, third letter R, fourth letter E? 

Upon checking words: 
- PREED? Not common? 
- PREEN? Yes, ""preen"" is a word: P, R, E, E, N? But problem: נN is out? First guess had N as x? And ""preen"" has N at the end? So cannot? 

- PRESS? P, R, E, S, S? Fifth letter S? But positions: 
  P(0), R(1), E(2), S(3), S(4) -> but we need R at index2? This has R at index1? And E at index2? So does not match our structure? 

Unless our indices are off? 

Position0: P? 
Position1: first blank? 
Position2: R? 
Position3: E? 
Position4: last blank? 

In ""PRESS"": 
  P at0, R at1, E at2, S at3, S at4? 
  -> R at index1? But we need R at index2? -> does not satisfy? 

What about: ""PRUDE""? P, R, U, D, E? -> same issue? R at index1? 

But our requirement is R at index2? 

To have R at index2? and P at0? then index1 can be any letter? 

For example, ""PORES"": P, O, R, E, S? 
This is: 
  P at0
  O at1
  R at2? -> yes
  E at3? -> Wait, in ""PORES"", fourth letter is E? Which would be index3? 
  S at4? 
Perfect? And ""PORES"" is a word? 

Now, does it match feedback? 
First, crane: 
  crane has R at index1? But in pores, R is at index2? So match ""-"" because R is present but not at the position guessed? 
  crane had E at index4? But in pores, E is at index3? And there's no E at index4? Since last letter is S? So E present but not at index4? So feedback for E in crane is ""-"" is correct? 

Peril: 
  For peril, we have:
    P✓ -> correct, first letter P? 
    E at index1: O at index1 in pores is not E? But E is in the word? At index3? So peril's E at index1 should be marked as ""-""? And it was? 
    R at index2: R is at index2 in pores? So marked ""✓"" which matches? 
    I at index3: in peril? And in secret, index3 is E? So not I? marked ""x"" is correct? 
    L at index4: secret has S? So not L? ""x"" correct? 

So ""PORES"" fits? 

And in guess2, peril's feedback: I and L are out? 

So secret word can be ""PORES""?
 But pores: P O R E S -> positions:
  0: P
  1: O
  2: R
  3: E
  4: S

And we have:
- P at0: yes
- O at1: we didn't know? Now we know?
- R at2: yes
- E at3: yes
- S at4: yes

And feedback matches? 

Therefore, our next guess can be ""PORES"" in hopes of getting it? 

But we are to guess? 

But also, there might be other words? Like ""PARES"", but A out? ""PURES""? U? ""PORES"" is one? 

Another word: ""PRIES"" but I out? 

""PKUES?"" not valid? 

So ""PORES"" or "" Pomes"" (P O M E S) but then R is not there? 

But we know R is in the word? 

In PORES, we have O and S as new letters? 

But in our next guess, since we have limited tries? We can guess PORES? 

But we are at guess3? We have 4 tries left? 

Since we strongly suspect PORES? But let's not jump? We can use a guess that might give more information? 

But if we think PORES fits, we can try it? 

Perhaps another word: ""P R E S T"" but E at2? Doesn't fit? 

 The only word I can think of is ""PORES"" or "" P R E E N"" but N out? 

 Therefore, I think ""PORES"" is a good guess? 

But earlier we deduced that E must be at index3? And R at2? 

So <guess>pores</guess>? 

But let's confirm: in our structure, E is at index3? In ""PORES"" yes: index0:P,1:O,2:R,3:E,4:S? 

So E at3? Index3 is the fourth letter? Yes.After analyzing the previous feedback, the following conclusions are drawn:

1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (crane):**
   - C (position 0) ❌: Not in the word.
   - R (position 1) ➖: In the word but wrong position.
   - A (position 2) ❌: Not in the word.
   - N (position 3) ❌: Not in the word.
   - E (position 4) ➖: In the word but wrong position.

2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (peril):**
   - P (position 0) ✅: Correct and in position.
   - E (position 1) ➖: In the word but wrong position.
   - R (position 2) ✅: Correct and in position.
   - I (position 3) ❌: Not in the word.
   - L (position 4) ❌: Not in the word.

### Key Deductions:
- The word starts with **P** (from peril's ✅ feedback).
- The third letter is **R** (from peril's ✅ feedback).
- **E** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (as per ➖ feedback from peril and crane). This leaves **position 3 (index 3)** as the only possible location for E.
- Eliminated letters: **C**, **A**, **N**, **I**, **L** (confirmed ❌ from feedback).
- The secret word structure is: **P _ R E _**, where:
  - Position 0: P (fixed).
  - Position 1: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, I, or L).
  - Position 2: R (fixed).
  - Position 3: E (deduced from constraints).
  - Position 4: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, I, or L).

### Strategy for This Guess:
- Test a valid word that fits the structure **P _ R E _**.
- Prioritize common letters for positions 1 and 4 to maximize information.
- After reviewing possible words, the word **PORES** fits all constraints:
  - P (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), E (position 3), S (position 4).
- **O** and **S** are new untested letters that are common. If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities.

This guess is consistent with all previous feedback and leverages the current knowledge efficiently. If incorrect, the response (e.g., feedback for O and S) will further define the solution space.

<guess>pores</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: peril -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) E(-) R(✓) I(x) L(x)
Guess 3: pores -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(x) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: peril
- P: ✓ (correct and in position)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)
- R: ✓ (correct and in position)
- I: x (not in word)
- L: x (not in word)

Guess 3: pores
- P: ✓ (correct and in position)
- O: x (not in word)
- R: ✓ (correct and in position)
- E: ✓ (correct and in position)
- S: x (not in word)

From this, we can deduce:

1. The secret word starts with P (from peril and pores both having P✓ at position 0).
2. The third letter is R (from peril and pores both having R✓ at position 2).
3. The fourth letter is E (from pores having E✓ at position 3).
4. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, I, L, O, S (from the x's in all guesses).

Additionally, from guess 1 (crane):
- R is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1). But now we know R is at position 2, so that's consistent.
- E is in the word but not at position 4 (index 4). Now we know E is at position 3, so that's also consistent.

The current known structure of the word is: P _ R E _

We are missing the second letter (position 1) and the fifth letter (position 4).

We also know that the second letter cannot be any of the eliminated letters: C, A, N, I, L, O, S. Similarly, the fifth letter cannot be these either.

Moreover, from guess 2 (peril), we had E at position 1 (index 1) and it was marked as '-' meaning E is in the word but not at that position. We now know E is at position 3, so that's fine.

Now, we need to find a word that fits: P ? R E ? 

The missing letters (at position 1 and 4) must be letters that have not been eliminated and are not in the set {C, A, N, I, L, O, S}.

We also note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let's list possible letters for position 1 and 4. The remaining letters (consonants and vowels) that are not eliminated:

Vowels left: U (since A, E, I, O are either used or eliminated; E is already placed, A, I, O are eliminated, so U is the only vowel left? But we have Y as well sometimes).

Actually, vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We have:
- A: eliminated (from crane)
- E: in word, placed at position 3
- I: eliminated (from peril)
- O: eliminated (from pores)
- U: not tested yet
- Y: not tested yet

Consonants: We have eliminated C, N, L, S. So available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P (but P is already used at start), Q, R (used at position 2), T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: R is already used at position 2, but it might appear again? The feedback hasn't indicated duplicates, but we don't know for sure. Similarly, E is at position 3, but might there be another E? We don't have evidence of duplicates so far.

Given the constraints, we can try to form words:

Possible words of the form P ? R E ? 

- PRUDE: P, R, U, D, E -> but this has R at position 1? No, PRUDE: P(0), R(1), U(2), D(3), E(4) -> but we need R at position 2 and E at position 3? So structure doesn't match.

We need: position0: P, position1: ?, position2: R, position3: E, position4: ?

So:
- Position0: P
- Position1: ? (unknown)
- Position2: R
- Position3: E
- Position4: ? 

Now, what words fit?

- PREXY? Not a word.
- PREDY? Not common.
- PREY? Only 4 letters.

Common words:
- PREED? Not common, and has E at 3 and 4? But we have E at 3, and if we put E at 4, then from crane we know E is not at 4? So PREED would have E at 4, which is disallowed by crane's feedback? Because crane had E at 4 and got '-', meaning E is not at 4.

So we cannot have E at 4.

Therefore, the fifth letter must not be E? And must be a new letter.

Another word: ""PRUNE""? But N is eliminated? And U at position1? 
PRUNE: P, R, U, N, E -> but N is eliminated? And structure: P(0), R(1), U(2), N(3), E(4) -> doesn't match because we need R at 2 and E at 3? Here R is at 1 and E at 4? Not matching.

We need R at position2 and E at position3.

So the only common word I can think of is ""PREYS""? But PREYS: P, R, E, Y, S -> 
P(0), R(1), E(2), Y(3), S(4) -> but we need R at position2? Here R is at1? And E at2? But we need E at3? So not matching.

Wait, what about ""PURE""? 4 letters.

""PURED""? Not a word.

""PURET""? Not common.

""PURGE""? P, U, R, G, E -> 
P(0), U(1), R(2), G(3), E(4) -> 
This has R at position2? Yes? 
But E at position4? And we know from crane that E is not at position4? So it would be invalid? 

But in PURGE, E is at4? And crane had E at4 and got '-', so secret word cannot have E at4? Therefore, PURGE is invalid.

Another possibility: ""PRESE""? But S is eliminated? And E at4? 

""PRETE""? Not common.

""PRETZ""? Not a word.

""PREVE""? Not common.

I am considering that the only common word that fits is ""PREXY"" but not valid.

Perhaps we missed a word: ""PRICE"" but I is eliminated.

""PRIDE"" -> I is eliminated? And structure: P(0), R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4) -> doesn't match.

""PRIME"" -> I eliminated.

""PRONE"" -> N eliminated and O is also eliminated? And E at4.

""PROSE"" -> O eliminated and E at4.

""PROVE"" -> O eliminated and E at4.

""PRUDE"" -> as before, structure doesn't match.

""PRUNE"" -> N eliminated.

""PRESA"" -> not 5 letters? And A eliminated.

Then what? 

Another idea: perhaps the word is ""P R E E N"" but N eliminated and 5 letters? Preen: P, R, E, E, N -> 
P(0), R(1), E(2), E(3), N(4) -> 
But we need R at position2? Here R is at1? And E at2 and3? But we need E at3? And N at4 is eliminated? So not.

But note: in preen, position2 is E? But we need R at position2? So not.

Perhaps we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any indication.

Alternatively, maybe our deduction that E must be at position3 is incorrect? But let's recheck:

- E is in the word (from crane and peril).
- E cannot be at position1 (from peril: E at1 was marked '-')? 
- E cannot be at position4 (from crane: E at4 was marked '-')? 
- Position0 is P (fixed)? 
- Position2 is R (fixed)? 
- Therefore, the only position left for E is position3? 

So it must be position3? 

Then the word must be P ? R E ? 

And the only common word I can think of is ""PURE"" but it's 4 letters? 

Or ""PURET"" which is not common? 

Another word: ""PZREK"" not valid.

Perhaps ""PYREX""? But that's 5 letters: P, Y, R, E, X? 
Positions: 
0: P
1: Y
2: R
3: E
4: X

And ""PYREX"" is a valid word (a brand, but also a word for heat-resistant glass).

Now, check against feedback:

- Letters: Y and X are new, not eliminated.
- Structure matches: P, Y, R, E, X.

Now, check with previous feedback:

Guess 1: crane
- C: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- R: in PYREX at position2, but in crane it was at position1 -> so '-' is correct (in word but wrong position).
- A: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- N: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- E: in PYREX at position3, but in crane at position4 -> '-' correct.

Guess 2: peril
- P: at0 -> ✓ correct.
- E: in PYREX at position3, but in peril at position1 -> '-' correct.
- R: at2 -> ✓ correct.
- I: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- L: not in PYREX -> x correct.

Guess 3: pores
- P: ✓ correct.
- O: not in PYREX -> x correct.
- R: ✓ correct.
- E: ✓ correct (at position3).
- S: not in PYREX -> x correct.

So ""PYREX"" fits all feedback.

Therefore, we can guess ""PYREX"".

But is it a valid word? Yes, it is accepted in word games as a proper noun, but sometimes allowed. If not, we might need an alternative.

Another common word? ""PREED"" is not common, but ""PYREX"" is more common in this context.

Alternatively, ""BREED"" not starting with P.

So I think ""PYREX"" is a good guess.

Therefore, we'll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses, the following is deduced:

- **Secret word structure**: The word starts with ""P"" (from Guess 2 and 3), has ""R"" in the third position (index 2), and ""E"" in the fourth position (index 3). This gives the pattern: `P _ R E _`.
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, I, L, O, S (marked ❌ in feedback).
- **Key constraints**:
  - The second letter (position 1) and fifth letter (position 4) must be letters not eliminated.
  - ""E"" cannot be in position 1 or 4 (per feedback from Guess 1 and 2), which is consistent with the current pattern.
  - ""R"" cannot be in position 1 (per Guess 1), which is satisfied.

The only common English word fitting `P _ R E _` with the eliminated letters excluded is **PYREX**:
- P (position 0), Y (position 1), R (position 2), E (position 3), X (position 4).
- ""Y"" and ""X"" are new, untested letters that are not eliminated.

This guess tests the remaining unknowns efficiently. If incorrect, the feedback will reveal the status of ""Y"" and ""X"", narrowing the solution to very few possibilities.

But in the feedback, positions are: index0: C, index1: R, index2: A, index3: N, index4: E).\n\n Actually, the feedback positions are:\n Position 0: C -> x\n Position 1: R -> - (meaning R is elsewhere)\n Position 2: A -> x\n Position 3: N -> x\n Position 4: E -> - (meaning E is elsewhere)\n\n Therefore, in our next guess:\n - We should avoid putting R at position 1 and E at position 4.\n - We should also include R and E somewhere else.\n\n Moreover, we don\'t know if there are any other letters that might be in the word.\n\n A good approach is to try a word that uses other common letters and places R and E in new positions.\n\n Since we eliminated C, A, N, we have many letters left. We can try to use more vowels and common consonants.\n\n Common consonants: S, T, L, etc. Vowels: O, I, U possibly.\n\n Let me try to form a word containing R and E but without C, A, N.\n\n Example: We could try ""ROGUE"" but let\'s check:\n - R at position 0 -> acceptable? But note R was misplaced in position 1 so maybe position 0 is possible.\n   However, we don\'t know if R is at position 0 or not? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about position 0 for R? Actually, the feedback for R was a dash meaning it is in the word but not at position 1. It could be at position 0, 2, 3, or 4? But wait, we also know E is at position 4 in the previous guess and was misplaced, so E is not at the end? Actually, E can be at any position except 4? Not necessarily: the feedback only says that in the first guess, the E at the fifth position (index4) was wrong. But E might be at another position.\n\n However, note: in the next guess we can place E at a different position.\n\n But also, the secret word might have E elsewhere? Yes.\n\n Now, let me consider the word ""STARE"". However, ""STARE"" has \'A\' which we know is not in the word (from feedback: A is x). So avoid A.\n\n Alternatively, ""STORE"" has S, T, O, R, E. But we haven\'t eliminated S, T, O. \n Also, note: in ""STORE"":\n - Positions: \n   0: S\n   1: T\n   2: O\n   3: R\n   4: E\n\n But we have constraints: R was in the word but not at position 1 -> in this guess R is at position 3 (which is acceptable). \n E was not at position 4 in the secret word? Wait, in the feedback for the first guess, E was at position 4 and it was misplaced, meaning E is in the word but not at position 4. In this guess, we are placing E at position 4 again? That would be a problem because we know E cannot be at position 4. So we cannot put E at position 4 in this guess.\n\n Therefore, we must avoid putting E at position 4.\n\n So ""STORE"" is invalid because E is at position 4.\n\n Let me try ""ROUTE"": R at 0, O, U, T, E at 4 -> again E at 4? No, we cannot do that.\n\n We need a word with E not at the end? For example, in the middle.\n\n How about ""TRIBE"": \n T, R at 1, I, B, E at 4 -> again E at 4? Avoid.\n\n Alternatively, how about ""SERVE"": \n S, E at 1, R at 2, V, E at 4 -> E at 1 and 4? But we know E is in the word, so it can appear multiple times? The feedback didn\'t specify if there are duplicates. However, in the first guess we only had one E and it was misplaced. We don\'t know if the word has more than one E? So we can consider words with two E\'s? But let\'s not overcomplicate: we know at least one E is present, so we must include at least one E somewhere not at the fifth position.\n\n In ""SERVE"": \n - Position 0: S -> okay\n - Position 1: E -> okay? But we don\'t have feedback for E at position 1. Only that it wasn\'t at position 4.\n - Position 2: R -> okay? Also, R was not supposed to be at position 1 -> here it\'s at position2, so acceptable.\n - Position 4: E -> avoid! We know E cannot be at position 4.\n\n So we have to avoid placing E at position 4.\n\n We need a word that has E in one of the positions 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n Example: ""DRIVE"": \n D, R at 1, I, V, E at 4 -> again E at 4? Not good.\n\n How about ""PERIL"": \n P, E at 1, R at 2, I, L -> \n Positions: \n  0: P\n  1: E -> E is at index1 -> acceptable? We don\'t know if E is at index1 in the secret word.\n  2: R -> R at index2 -> acceptable because previously R was at index1 and we know it wasn\'t there. \n  3: I\n  4: L\n\n This word: PERIL\n - Contains E and R.\n - E is at position1 -> valid since we only know it\'s not at position4.\n - R is at position2 -> valid because we know it\'s not at position1.\n\n Also, we avoid C, A, N.\n\n It uses other common letters: P, E, R, I, L.\n\n So this seems like a good candidate.\n\n We could try other words as well, such as ""REPLY"", but that has Y which is less common. And ""PERIL"" has the advantage of testing two new vowels (I and no other vowel) and a mix.\n\n Alternatively, let me think: we know that in the secret word, R must be somewhere, and E must be somewhere not at the end. Another word could be ""MERGE"": \n M, E at1, R at2, G, E at4 -> again E at4? Avoid.\n\n Or ""BERET"": \n B, E at1, R at2, E at3, T -> \n Positions: \n  0: B\n  1: E -> okay\n  2: R -> okay\n  3: E -> okay (and we are testing if E appears twice? But we don\'t know, so it\'s acceptable)\n  4: T -> but no E at4? Actually, in this word, E is at positions1 and3, not at4.\n\n However, wait: the fifth letter is T. So E is not at position4. Therefore, it\'s acceptable.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicates? We might, so we can try words with duplicate E\'s? But we have eliminated A and N, and C, so E might duplicate? Not sure.\n\n Alternatively, let\'s stick with ""PERIL"" because it is a valid word and doesn\'t have E at the end.\n\n Another possibility: ""RINSE"". But check: \n R at0, I, N -> wait, we have N? N was eliminated because in the first guess N was an x -> meaning not in the word. So ""RINSE"" contains N -> cannot be used. So we must avoid N.\n\n Similarly, avoid A and C and N.\n\n Therefore, ""PERIL"" doesn\'t contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\n Let me confirm: \n P: we don\'t know -> okay\n E: we want to include -> okay\n R: we want to include -> okay\n I: unknown -> okay\n L: unknown -> okay\n\n And positions: E at1, R at2 -> so R is not at1 (good) and E is not at4 (good).\n\n Therefore, ""PERIL"" is a good second guess.\n\n Let\'s consider another word: ""SPIRE"" -> \n S, P, I, R, E at4 -> but E at4: avoid.\n\n Another word: ""GIVER"" -> \n G, I, V, E, R at4 -> R is at4? and E at3? actually: \n positions: \n  0: G\n  1: I\n  2: V\n  3: E -> acceptable for E? we don\'t know if position3 is allowed? and R at4? but R could be at4? because previously R was only disallowed at position1? so position4 is allowed for R? \n However, this word ends with R, and we do not know if that\'s bad? But we haven\'t eliminated it. Also, E is at position3 -> acceptable because we don\'t have any feedback that E cannot be at 3? \n\n But note: we also don\'t know if R is allowed at position4? The feedback only said R is not at position1. Position4 is fine.\n\n However, another issue: the word ""GIVER"" has R at the end? and E at position3? So it might be acceptable? But we have E at position3 and R at position4? Then why stop at PERIL? Both are acceptable.\n\n However, we also want to cover more common letters? ""PERIL"" uses L, while ""GIVER"" uses V and R. V is less common? So maybe ""PERIL"" is better.\n\n Let\'s go with ""PERIL"".\n\n So the next guess: PERILBased on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, N are not in the word (x)\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (index 1)\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (index 4)\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include R and E\n- Avoid C, A, N\n- R cannot be in position 2 (index 1)\n- E cannot be in position 5 (index 4)\n- Prioritizes common letters to maximize information\n\nThe word **PERIL** is chosen because:\n- Contains R (placed at position 3, avoiding index 1)\n- Contains E (placed at position 2, avoiding index 4)\n- Uses P, I, L—common letters not yet tested\n- Avoids eliminated letters C, A, N\n\n<guess>peril</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: peril -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) E(-) R(✓) I(x) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\nFirst guess: crane\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position) → R is in the word but not at position 2 (index 1)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word but not at position 5 (index 4)\n\nSecond guess: peril\n- P: ✓ (correct position) → So the first letter of the secret word is P.\n- E: - (in word, wrong position) → E is in the word but not at position 2 (index 1). Also, from first guess, we know E is not at position 5 (index 4).\n- R: ✓ (correct position) → So the third letter of the secret word is R.\n- I: x (not in word)\n- L: x (not in word)\n\nWhat we know so far:\n- The secret word starts with P and has R as the third letter: P _ R _ _\n- E is in the word, but not at position 2 (from peril feedback) and not at position 5 (from crane feedback). The possible positions for E are now positions 1 (if we consider index starting at 0) or 4? But note positions: \n  Index 0: P (fixed)\n  Index 1: second letter → E cannot be here because in peril, E was at index 1 and got ""-"" meaning it\'s not there.\n  Index 2: R (fixed)\n  Index 3: fourth letter\n  Index 4: fifth letter → E cannot be here (from crane)\n\nSo E must be at position 4? Wait, index 4 is the fifth letter? The positions are:\n  0: P (first letter)\n  1: second letter → E is not here (from peril)\n  2: R (third letter)\n  3: fourth letter\n  4: fifth letter → E is not here? But from crane, E was at index 4 and got ""-"", meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So E must be at one of the other positions? But position 0 is fixed to P? Position 2 is fixed to R? So E must be at position 3? Because positions 0,2 are fixed and 1 and 4 are ruled out for E.\n\nLet me clarify:\n- The secret word is 5 letters: positions 0,1,2,3,4.\n- We know:\n  - Position 0: P (from peril\'s P✓)\n  - Position 2: R (from peril\'s R✓)\n- From crane: E is in the word but not at position 4? Actually, crane had E at position 4? Or at the fifth position which is index 4? So E is not at index 4.\n- From peril: E is at index 1 and got ""-"", so not at index 1.\n\nTherefore, E must be at either index 0? But index0 is P, so not E? Or index 3? That\'s the only position left: indices 0,1,2 are occupied? Index0 is P, index2 is R? Index1 and index1 is out? So index3 is the fourth letter? And index4 the fifth?\n\nSo positions available: index3 and index4? But index4 is ruled out for E? Therefore, E must be at index3? But index3 is the fourth letter? Yes.\n\nSo: the secret word has P at start, then some letter at position1, then R at position2, then E at position3? And then a letter at position4? But we know from crane that E is in the word? Yes.\n\nAdditionally, from crane we have R at index1 and it was ""-"", meaning R is in the word but not at index1? But now we know R is at index2? So that\'s consistent? And E at index3? Which wasn\'t present in crane? Because in crane E was at index4? So index3 wasn\'t tested? So that\'s fine.\n\nTherefore, we have: P _ R E _ \n\nThe word must be of the form: P? R E ? \n\nNow, what about the missing letters? We know:\n- C, A, N, I, L are not in the word? From first guess: C, A, N out. From second: I and L out.\n- E is at position3? \n- We have two positions: position1 and position4.\n\nMoreover, what letters are present? We know R and E and P? Also, from crane feedback, we had R and E indicated? So the secret word must have R and E? Yes.\n\nWhat about position1? We must choose a letter that hasn\'t been eliminated? And that is not any of: C, A, N, I, L? And also, we haven\'t tested any other letters? Well, we also know that in crane, the first letter C was out? Then peril had P, E, R, I, L? So I and L are out? Therefore, the set of eliminated letters: C, A, N, I, L? \n\nStill many letters left? E.g., B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z? But common letters.\n\nNow, we must form a word: P ? R E ? \n\nAnd the fifth letter (index4) is the last one? We don\'t know? \n\nBut also, we have the R? And E? \n\nMoreover, we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters? But we haven\'t seen any duplicates so far? So let\'s assume no duplicates? Since we haven\'t been warned? \n\nTherefore, the letter at position1 and position4 must be distinct? And must not be any of the eliminated ones? \n\nAlso, we know from crane: R was in the word but not at index1? Well, we have R at index2? So position1? We don\'t know yet? \n\nSimilarly, crane didn\'t test position3? So E was not at index4? But now we place E at index3? \n\nSo for our next guess, we can test the form: P? R E ? \n\nBut we don\'t know position1 and position4? \n\nWe can choose a word that fits: P? R E ? \n\nFor example, we can try: PUREM? But not a word? \n\nValid English words: \n- PURE? Only 4 letters? Must be 5 letters.\n- PURED? Not a word? \n- PURGE? \n  P U R G E -> \n  We have R at index2? The word PURGE: \n    P at0, U at1, R at2, G at3, E at4? \n  But according to our reasoning, E should be at index3? And G would be at index3? Then E at index4? But we thought E must be at index3? \n\nWait, this conflicts? Let me reexamine:\n\nWe have: \n- Secret word has E in it? \n- Positions where E can be? \n  From peril feedback: E was at index1 and wrong? So E not at index1? \n  From crane feedback: E was at index4 and wrong? So E not at index4? \n  Therefore, E must be at index0? Index0 is P? So impossible? Or at index3? \n\nBut index3: fourth letter? \n\nFor example, in PURE? But again, not 5 letters? \n\nWe need a 5-letter word? So positions: \n0: P \n1: ? \n2: R \n3: ? \n4: ? \n\nBut in our earlier, we concluded E must be at index3? Because we already eliminated index1 and index4? \n\nBut index0 is taken by P? Index2 by R? Only index3 left? So E must be at index3? \n\nTherefore, the word is: P ? R E ? \n\nAnd the last letter at index4? \n\nTherefore, structure: P, then a letter at1, then R, then E, then a letter at4? \n\nNow, examples of English words: \n- PREY? Only 4 letters? \n- PRESS? \n  But structure: P, R, E, S, S -> but positions: \n    0:P, 1:R? Wait no: we have R at position2? In PRESS: \n      P(0), R(1), E(2), S(3), S(4)? \n  But we require R at position2 (index2)? So cannot be at index1? \n\nWe need the R at index2? And E at index3? So:\nPositions: \n0: P\n1: ? \n2: R \n3: E \n4: ?\n\nSo the word must be: ? P (1st letter)? R (3rd letter)? E (4th letter) and last letter? \n\nSo possible words: \n- PRE? D? -> PREED? Not a word?\n- PREST? \n  P, R, E, S, T -> but that has E at index2? We need E at index3? \n\nActually, we need: \nPosition 0: P \nPosition 1: ? (a letter we don\'t know) \nPosition 2: R \nPosition 3: E \nPosition 4: ? \n\nSo we have letters: P, ?, R, E, ? \n\nNow, valid English words: \n- PROSE? \n  P, R, O, S, E -> that’s P(0), R(2)? Wait, positions: \n  0: P\n  1: R? -> but R is at index1? We need R at index2? Instead, it has O at index2? \n\nSo no? \n\n- PRICE? But I is eliminated? I is out? Peril had I and it was x? \n\n- PRUDE? \n  P, R, U, D, E -> structure: \n  0: P\n  1: R? at1? But we need R at index2? Instead, it has U at2? \n\nWe need R at index2? Meaning the third letter is R? \n\nExamples: \n- PRE? E? Not easy? \n\nAnother word: PRI? E? But I out? \n\nPossible words: \n- PROBE? \n  P, R, O, B, E -> E is at index4? But that\'s invalid? Because we know E not at index4? \n\nBut in PROBE: E is at the end? Index4? We cannot have E there? \n\n- PRONE? \n  P, R, O, N, E -> but N is eliminated from first guess? N is out? \n\n- PROSE? E at end? No? \n\nWhat about: \n- PRIME? But I is out? \n- PRATE? A is out? \n- PROVE? \n  P, R, O, V, E -> E at index4? Disallowed? \n\nBut again, E not at4.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is to have E at index3? And then we need a word with form: P, (letter), R, E, (letter)\n\nValid English words? \n- PERSE? Not common? \n- WORDS: PRE? Let me list:\n  One common word: P R E S T? Prest is not common?\n  Another: *PRESET? 6 letters?\n  5-letter words with pattern P?RE?\n\nPerhaps: \n- PURSE: P, U, R, S, E -> \n  Positions: \n  0: P\n  1: U\n  2: R -> yes\n  3: S -> but E? At index4? But we need E at index3? In PURSE, index3 is S? Index4 is E? -> but E at index4? Which we cannot have? \n\nUnless our initial reasoning was wrong? \n\nTherefore, we must reconsider the position of E? \n\nReexamine feedback:\n\nFirst guess: crane -> \n  Positions: \n    0: C -> x\n    1: R -> -\n    2: A -> x\n    3: N -> x\n    4: E -> -\n  Meaning: \n    C, A, N not in word? \n    R in word, not at index1? \n    E in word, not at index4? \n\nSecond guess: peril? \n  Positions: \n    0: P -> ✓ → P correct at index0? \n    1: E -> - → E in word, not at index1? \n    2: R -> ✓ → R correct at index2? \n    3: I -> x\n    4: L -> x\n\nNow, we have:\n- The secret word has P at0? R at2? \n- And E must be in the word? But where? \nFrom peril, E was guessed at index1? And given ""-"", so E is in the word but not at index1? \nFrom crane, E was at index4? And given ""-"", so E in word but not at index4? \n\nTherefore, the only possibilities are index3? Since index0,2 are fixed? And index1,4 ruled out? \n\nBut index3: the fourth letter? \n\nTherefore, the secret word must be: \n  P at0, ? at1, R at2, E at3, ? at4? \n\nAnd such word exists? \n\nExamples: \n- FRE? E? \nNot easy? Few ones:\n\n- PRE?D: Not common? \n- SPREE? \n  S,P,R,E,E? That’s 5 letters: \n    0: S? -> not P? \n\nBut we must start with P? \n\nTherefore, the only word that comes to mind is: ""PUREE""? \nPUREE: P, U, R, E, E? \nBut positions:\n  0: P? OK?\n  1: U? \n  2: R? OK? \n  3: E? OK? \n  4: E? \n\nAnd E at index3? Yes? And E at index4? But we have two E\'s? And it is a word?\n\nAnd feedback: \nFrom crane: E at index4 was given ""-"", meaning the secret word has an E but not at position4? In a word with two E\'s? It could be? The E is present? So our guess crane had E at4? Which is not the position of E? Because E is at3? But if there\'s another E at4? Then the first guess would have shown E at4 as correct? Because it is present? But crane\'s E at index4 got a dash? Meaning it is in the word but not at that position? If the secret word has an E at4, then crane\'s E at4 would have been ✓? \n\nTherefore, for crane\'s guess:\n- If the secret word had an E at the fifth position (like in puree)? Then the feedback for E would be ✓? But crane got ""-""? So if secret word is puree, then crane\'s E at4? It should be matched? But feedback was ""-"" meaning it\'s not at that position? Hence, secret word cannot have E at index4? Even if there is another E? \n\nSo puree has E at index3 and index4? \n- The E at index4? Is present? So in crane\'s guess, when we put E at4? It would be correct if secret has an E at4? \n\nBut in crane, we got ""-"" for E, meaning: the secret has an E, but not at position4? So even though there may be an E at4 in the secret? The feedback would have been ""✓"" if there were an E at that position? Because it\'s a match? \n\nBut crane\'s E at4 got ""-"", so that indicates that the secret does not have E at4? \n\nIn puree, there is an E at4? So crane\'s E at4 would have been ✓? But the feedback was ""-"" for E at4? Therefore, puree cannot be the word? \n\nSimilarly, any word with E at4 is disallowed? \n\nTherefore, our structure must be P? R E ? with E only at index3? And not at4? \n\nAnother possibility: ""PREDY""? but not common? \n\nOr ""PRENT""? But N out? \n\nOr ""PRESA""? Not 5 letters? \n\nI\'m struggling? Let\'s consider that our deduction about the position of E might be correct, but the word is rare? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other words? \n\nAnother word: ""PROKE""? Or ""PRUME""? Not valid? \n\nValid English words: \n- ""pure""? but 4 letters? \n- ""press""? has E at2? \n- ""price""? has I? Out? \n- ""prase""? But A out? \n- ""prime""? I out? \n- ""prose""? has O? And E at4? But disallowed? \n- ""prove""? E at4? \n- ""prude""? E at4? \n\nThe only one I can think of is ""PREED""? But not valid? \n\nBut wait, there is ""PREED"" in some dictionaries? But let\'s avoid? \n\nAnother idea: perhaps we missed that in the first guess, crane had R at index1? And got ""-""? And in peril we have R at index2 and got ""✓""? So R is fixed at index2? \n\nAlso, E cannot be at index1 or index4? \n\nBut what if the word has E at index0? But index0 is P? So not? \n\nTherefore, index3 is the only possibility? \n\nThen we must have a 5-letter word: letter1 at index1? And letter2 at index4? \n\nSo: P, X, R, E, Y? \n\nAnd X and Y are letters not eliminated? And not C,A,N,I,L? \n\nMoreover, the word must be valid? \n\nExamples: \n- ""PER I E S""? No? \n- ""PRESENT"" is 6 letters? \n- ""PRED""? No? \n\nLet me search: \n  BRED? Not starting with P? \n  CRED? No? \n  DRED? No? \n  FRED? No? \n  GRED? Not a word? \n  PIRED? But I out? \n  TRED? \n  But no? \n\nAnother: PARSE? A out? \n\nPORED? O? And E at4? \n\n But E at4 disallowed? \n\nThen ""PORES""? has O? and E at4? \n\nSame issue? \n\nPerhaps ""PORKY""? No E? \n\nBut we need E? \n\nTherefore, maybe our deduction is incorrect? \n\nAnother possibility: in peril, the? Maybe E is at a different position? But peril\'s feedback showed E as ""-"", so it is in the word? How else? \n\nPerhaps the word has duplicate E\'s? For example, at different positions? \n\nBut we\'ve ruled out index1 and index4 for E? So only index3? \n\nBut let\'s brainstorm words: \n  PIRE? No?\n  PER?? But then E at1? And peril has E at1? But got ""-"", so E not at1? \n\nTherefore, the only remaining is that E must be at index3? \n\nAnd the last letter at index4? So we have to guess a word that has P, then a letter, then R, then E, then a letter? \n\nOne common word: ""PREZA""? Not? \nAnother: ""PHREV""? Not? \n\nPerhaps ""PRED""? Not 5? \n""PRES"" not 5? \n""PREST"" has E at2? \n\nBut we need E at3? \n\nExample: ""PRET"" not 5?\n\nAnother: ""GREET"" not P? \n\n""FREED"" not P? \n\n""BREED"" not P? \n\n Then what? \n\nPerhaps ""PRI E D""? But I out? \n\nThen ""PROBE"" E at4? \n\nDisallowed? \n\nUnless the feedback for E in crane means that for crane\'s guess at position4, it is not E it is something else? But E is still in the word? \n\nBut the structure must have P, X, R, E, Y? \n\nValid word: ""PAR E S""? A out? \n\n""PURE""? 4 letters? \n\n""PURELY"" 6 letters? \n\nSo perhaps "" puree"" is accepted? Even though it has E at the end? But crane feedback conflict? \n\nOr another word: ""P R E E N""? 6 letters? \n\n""PRET""? No? \n\nPerhaps we got the positions wrong? \n\nLet\'s double-check indices:\n\nFor peril:\n  P (index0), E (index1), R (index2), I (index3), L (index4)\n\nFeedback:\n  P(0) ✓ -> P correct at0\n  E(1) - -> E in word but not at1\n  R(2) ✓ -> R correct at2\n  I(3) x? But if the secret has E at3? Then why not? \n\nBut in peril\'s feedback, index3 was I and it was x? And we are assuming E is at3? So in secret at3 is E? So peril\'s I was mismatched? \n\nBut for the secret word, pattern PxREx? \n\nAnd peril at index3 was I? Which is not correct? \n\nNow, new guess: we know almost the word is P? R E? \n\nBut we don\'t know the first blank and the last blank? \n\nWe can try a guess that fits and tests potential letters? \n\nFor example, choose a word that has the form P* R E *? With * being new letters? \n\nFor example, ""PR EED"" not valid? \n\n""PRED?"" no? \n\n""PR E S T"" but then E is at index2? Not index3? \n\nAlternatively to test, perhaps ""PRE E"" is not possible? \n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word is ""PREED"" but it\'s not valid in some dictionaries? \n\nBut let\'s consider common words: \n  5 letters, start with P, third letter R, fourth letter E? \n\nUpon checking words: \n- PREED? Not common? \n- PREEN? Yes, ""preen"" is a word: P, R, E, E, N? But problem: נN is out? First guess had N as x? And ""preen"" has N at the end? So cannot? \n\n- PRESS? P, R, E, S, S? Fifth letter S? But positions: \n  P(0), R(1), E(2), S(3), S(4) -> but we need R at index2? This has R at index1? And E at index2? So does not match our structure? \n\nUnless our indices are off? \n\nPosition0: P? \nPosition1: first blank? \nPosition2: R? \nPosition3: E? \nPosition4: last blank? \n\nIn ""PRESS"": \n  P at0, R at1, E at2, S at3, S at4? \n  -> R at index1? But we need R at index2? -> does not satisfy? \n\nWhat about: ""PRUDE""? P, R, U, D, E? -> same issue? R at index1? \n\nBut our requirement is R at index2? \n\nTo have R at index2? and P at0? then index1 can be any letter? \n\nFor example, ""PORES"": P, O, R, E, S? \nThis is: \n  P at0\n  O at1\n  R at2? -> yes\n  E at3? -> Wait, in ""PORES"", fourth letter is E? Which would be index3? \n  S at4? \nPerfect? And ""PORES"" is a word? \n\nNow, does it match feedback? \nFirst, crane: \n  crane has R at index1? But in pores, R is at index2? So match ""-"" because R is present but not at the position guessed? \n  crane had E at index4? But in pores, E is at index3? And there\'s no E at index4? Since last letter is S? So E present but not at index4? So feedback for E in crane is ""-"" is correct? \n\nPeril: \n  For peril, we have:\n    P✓ -> correct, first letter P? \n    E at index1: O at index1 in pores is not E? But E is in the word? At index3? So peril\'s E at index1 should be marked as ""-""? And it was? \n    R at index2: R is at index2 in pores? So marked ""✓"" which matches? \n    I at index3: in peril? And in secret, index3 is E? So not I? marked ""x"" is correct? \n    L at index4: secret has S? So not L? ""x"" correct? \n\nSo ""PORES"" fits? \n\nAnd in guess2, peril\'s feedback: I and L are out? \n\nSo secret word can be ""PORES""?\n But pores: P O R E S -> positions:\n  0: P\n  1: O\n  2: R\n  3: E\n  4: S\n\nAnd we have:\n- P at0: yes\n- O at1: we didn\'t know? Now we know?\n- R at2: yes\n- E at3: yes\n- S at4: yes\n\nAnd feedback matches? \n\nTherefore, our next guess can be ""PORES"" in hopes of getting it? \n\nBut we are to guess? \n\nBut also, there might be other words? Like ""PARES"", but A out? ""PURES""? U? ""PORES"" is one? \n\nAnother word: ""PRIES"" but I out? \n\n""PKUES?"" not valid? \n\nSo ""PORES"" or "" Pomes"" (P O M E S) but then R is not there? \n\nBut we know R is in the word? \n\nIn PORES, we have O and S as new letters? \n\nBut in our next guess, since we have limited tries? We can guess PORES? \n\nBut we are at guess3? We have 4 tries left? \n\nSince we strongly suspect PORES? But let\'s not jump? We can use a guess that might give more information? \n\nBut if we think PORES fits, we can try it? \n\nPerhaps another word: ""P R E S T"" but E at2? Doesn\'t fit? \n\n The only word I can think of is ""PORES"" or "" P R E E N"" but N out? \n\n Therefore, I think ""PORES"" is a good guess? \n\nBut earlier we deduced that E must be at index3? And R at2? \n\nSo <guess>pores</guess>? \n\nBut let\'s confirm: in our structure, E is at index3? In ""PORES"" yes: index0:P,1:O,2:R,3:E,4:S? \n\nSo E at3? Index3 is the fourth letter? Yes.After analyzing the previous feedback, the following conclusions are drawn:\n\n1. **Feedback from Guess 1 (crane):**\n   - C (position 0) ❌: Not in the word.\n   - R (position 1) ➖: In the word but wrong position.\n   - A (position 2) ❌: Not in the word.\n   - N (position 3) ❌: Not in the word.\n   - E (position 4) ➖: In the word but wrong position.\n\n2. **Feedback from Guess 2 (peril):**\n   - P (position 0) ✅: Correct and in position.\n   - E (position 1) ➖: In the word but wrong position.\n   - R (position 2) ✅: Correct and in position.\n   - I (position 3) ❌: Not in the word.\n   - L (position 4) ❌: Not in the word.\n\n### Key Deductions:\n- The word starts with **P** (from peril\'s ✅ feedback).\n- The third letter is **R** (from peril\'s ✅ feedback).\n- **E** is in the word but cannot be in positions 1 or 4 (as per ➖ feedback from peril and crane). This leaves **position 3 (index 3)** as the only possible location for E.\n- Eliminated letters: **C**, **A**, **N**, **I**, **L** (confirmed ❌ from feedback).\n- The secret word structure is: **P _ R E _**, where:\n  - Position 0: P (fixed).\n  - Position 1: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, I, or L).\n  - Position 2: R (fixed).\n  - Position 3: E (deduced from constraints).\n  - Position 4: Unknown letter (not C, A, N, I, or L).\n\n### Strategy for This Guess:\n- Test a valid word that fits the structure **P _ R E _**.\n- Prioritize common letters for positions 1 and 4 to maximize information.\n- After reviewing possible words, the word **PORES** fits all constraints:\n  - P (position 0), O (position 1), R (position 2), E (position 3), S (position 4).\n- **O** and **S** are new untested letters that are common. If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down possibilities.\n\nThis guess is consistent with all previous feedback and leverages the current knowledge efficiently. If incorrect, the response (e.g., feedback for O and S) will further define the solution space.\n\n<guess>pores</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: peril -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) E(-) R(✓) I(x) L(x)\nGuess 3: pores -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(x) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane\n- C: x (not in word)\n- R: - (in word, wrong position)\n- A: x (not in word)\n- N: x (not in word)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position)\n\nGuess 2: peril\n- P: ✓ (correct and in position)\n- E: - (in word, wrong position)\n- R: ✓ (correct and in position)\n- I: x (not in word)\n- L: x (not in word)\n\nGuess 3: pores\n- P: ✓ (correct and in position)\n- O: x (not in word)\n- R: ✓ (correct and in position)\n- E: ✓ (correct and in position)\n- S: x (not in word)\n\nFrom this, we can deduce:\n\n1. The secret word starts with P (from peril and pores both having P✓ at position 0).\n2. The third letter is R (from peril and pores both having R✓ at position 2).\n3. The fourth letter is E (from pores having E✓ at position 3).\n4. We know the following letters are not in the word: C, A, N, I, L, O, S (from the x\'s in all guesses).\n\nAdditionally, from guess 1 (crane):\n- R is in the word but not at position 1 (index 1). But now we know R is at position 2, so that\'s consistent.\n- E is in the word but not at position 4 (index 4). Now we know E is at position 3, so that\'s also consistent.\n\nThe current known structure of the word is: P _ R E _\n\nWe are missing the second letter (position 1) and the fifth letter (position 4).\n\nWe also know that the second letter cannot be any of the eliminated letters: C, A, N, I, L, O, S. Similarly, the fifth letter cannot be these either.\n\nMoreover, from guess 2 (peril), we had E at position 1 (index 1) and it was marked as \'-\' meaning E is in the word but not at that position. We now know E is at position 3, so that\'s fine.\n\nNow, we need to find a word that fits: P ? R E ? \n\nThe missing letters (at position 1 and 4) must be letters that have not been eliminated and are not in the set {C, A, N, I, L, O, S}.\n\nWe also note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s list possible letters for position 1 and 4. The remaining letters (consonants and vowels) that are not eliminated:\n\nVowels left: U (since A, E, I, O are either used or eliminated; E is already placed, A, I, O are eliminated, so U is the only vowel left? But we have Y as well sometimes).\n\nActually, vowels: A, E, I, O, U (and sometimes Y). We have:\n- A: eliminated (from crane)\n- E: in word, placed at position 3\n- I: eliminated (from peril)\n- O: eliminated (from pores)\n- U: not tested yet\n- Y: not tested yet\n\nConsonants: We have eliminated C, N, L, S. So available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P (but P is already used at start), Q, R (used at position 2), T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: R is already used at position 2, but it might appear again? The feedback hasn\'t indicated duplicates, but we don\'t know for sure. Similarly, E is at position 3, but might there be another E? We don\'t have evidence of duplicates so far.\n\nGiven the constraints, we can try to form words:\n\nPossible words of the form P ? R E ? \n\n- PRUDE: P, R, U, D, E -> but this has R at position 1? No, PRUDE: P(0), R(1), U(2), D(3), E(4) -> but we need R at position 2 and E at position 3? So structure doesn\'t match.\n\nWe need: position0: P, position1: ?, position2: R, position3: E, position4: ?\n\nSo:\n- Position0: P\n- Position1: ? (unknown)\n- Position2: R\n- Position3: E\n- Position4: ? \n\nNow, what words fit?\n\n- PREXY? Not a word.\n- PREDY? Not common.\n- PREY? Only 4 letters.\n\nCommon words:\n- PREED? Not common, and has E at 3 and 4? But we have E at 3, and if we put E at 4, then from crane we know E is not at 4? So PREED would have E at 4, which is disallowed by crane\'s feedback? Because crane had E at 4 and got \'-\', meaning E is not at 4.\n\nSo we cannot have E at 4.\n\nTherefore, the fifth letter must not be E? And must be a new letter.\n\nAnother word: ""PRUNE""? But N is eliminated? And U at position1? \nPRUNE: P, R, U, N, E -> but N is eliminated? And structure: P(0), R(1), U(2), N(3), E(4) -> doesn\'t match because we need R at 2 and E at 3? Here R is at 1 and E at 4? Not matching.\n\nWe need R at position2 and E at position3.\n\nSo the only common word I can think of is ""PREYS""? But PREYS: P, R, E, Y, S -> \nP(0), R(1), E(2), Y(3), S(4) -> but we need R at position2? Here R is at1? And E at2? But we need E at3? So not matching.\n\nWait, what about ""PURE""? 4 letters.\n\n""PURED""? Not a word.\n\n""PURET""? Not common.\n\n""PURGE""? P, U, R, G, E -> \nP(0), U(1), R(2), G(3), E(4) -> \nThis has R at position2? Yes? \nBut E at position4? And we know from crane that E is not at position4? So it would be invalid? \n\nBut in PURGE, E is at4? And crane had E at4 and got \'-\', so secret word cannot have E at4? Therefore, PURGE is invalid.\n\nAnother possibility: ""PRESE""? But S is eliminated? And E at4? \n\n""PRETE""? Not common.\n\n""PRETZ""? Not a word.\n\n""PREVE""? Not common.\n\nI am considering that the only common word that fits is ""PREXY"" but not valid.\n\nPerhaps we missed a word: ""PRICE"" but I is eliminated.\n\n""PRIDE"" -> I is eliminated? And structure: P(0), R(1), I(2), D(3), E(4) -> doesn\'t match.\n\n""PRIME"" -> I eliminated.\n\n""PRONE"" -> N eliminated and O is also eliminated? And E at4.\n\n""PROSE"" -> O eliminated and E at4.\n\n""PROVE"" -> O eliminated and E at4.\n\n""PRUDE"" -> as before, structure doesn\'t match.\n\n""PRUNE"" -> N eliminated.\n\n""PRESA"" -> not 5 letters? And A eliminated.\n\nThen what? \n\nAnother idea: perhaps the word is ""P R E E N"" but N eliminated and 5 letters? Preen: P, R, E, E, N -> \nP(0), R(1), E(2), E(3), N(4) -> \nBut we need R at position2? Here R is at1? And E at2 and3? But we need E at3? And N at4 is eliminated? So not.\n\nBut note: in preen, position2 is E? But we need R at position2? So not.\n\nPerhaps we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we haven\'t seen any indication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe our deduction that E must be at position3 is incorrect? But let\'s recheck:\n\n- E is in the word (from crane and peril).\n- E cannot be at position1 (from peril: E at1 was marked \'-\')? \n- E cannot be at position4 (from crane: E at4 was marked \'-\')? \n- Position0 is P (fixed)? \n- Position2 is R (fixed)? \n- Therefore, the only position left for E is position3? \n\nSo it must be position3? \n\nThen the word must be P ? R E ? \n\nAnd the only common word I can think of is ""PURE"" but it\'s 4 letters? \n\nOr ""PURET"" which is not common? \n\nAnother word: ""PZREK"" not valid.\n\nPerhaps ""PYREX""? But that\'s 5 letters: P, Y, R, E, X? \nPositions: \n0: P\n1: Y\n2: R\n3: E\n4: X\n\nAnd ""PYREX"" is a valid word (a brand, but also a word for heat-resistant glass).\n\nNow, check against feedback:\n\n- Letters: Y and X are new, not eliminated.\n- Structure matches: P, Y, R, E, X.\n\nNow, check with previous feedback:\n\nGuess 1: crane\n- C: not in PYREX -> x correct.\n- R: in PYREX at position2, but in crane it was at position1 -> so \'-\' is correct (in word but wrong position).\n- A: not in PYREX -> x correct.\n- N: not in PYREX -> x correct.\n- E: in PYREX at position3, but in crane at position4 -> \'-\' correct.\n\nGuess 2: peril\n- P: at0 -> ✓ correct.\n- E: in PYREX at position3, but in peril at position1 -> \'-\' correct.\n- R: at2 -> ✓ correct.\n- I: not in PYREX -> x correct.\n- L: not in PYREX -> x correct.\n\nGuess 3: pores\n- P: ✓ correct.\n- O: not in PYREX -> x correct.\n- R: ✓ correct.\n- E: ✓ correct (at position3).\n- S: not in PYREX -> x correct.\n\nSo ""PYREX"" fits all feedback.\n\nTherefore, we can guess ""PYREX"".\n\nBut is it a valid word? Yes, it is accepted in word games as a proper noun, but sometimes allowed. If not, we might need an alternative.\n\nAnother common word? ""PREED"" is not common, but ""PYREX"" is more common in this context.\n\nAlternatively, ""BREED"" not starting with P.\n\nSo I think ""PYREX"" is a good guess.\n\nTherefore, we\'ll go with that.Based on the feedback from previous guesses, the following is deduced:\n\n- **Secret word structure**: The word starts with ""P"" (from Guess 2 and 3), has ""R"" in the third position (index 2), and ""E"" in the fourth position (index 3). This gives the pattern: `P _ R E _`.\n- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, I, L, O, S (marked ❌ in feedback).\n- **Key constraints**:\n  - The second letter (position 1) and fifth letter (position 4) must be letters not eliminated.\n  - ""E"" cannot be in position 1 or 4 (per feedback from Guess 1 and 2), which is consistent with the current pattern.\n  - ""R"" cannot be in position 1 (per Guess 1), which is satisfied.\n\nThe only common English word fitting `P _ R E _` with the eliminated letters excluded is **PYREX**:\n- P (position 0), Y (position 1), R (position 2), E (position 3), X (position 4).\n- ""Y"" and ""X"" are new, untested letters that are not eliminated.\n\nThis guess tests the remaining unknowns efficiently. If incorrect, the feedback will reveal the status of ""Y"" and ""X"", narrowing the solution to very few possibilities.\n\n<guess>pyrex</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: peril -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) E(-) R(✓) I(x) L(x)\nGuess 3: pores -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(x) R(✓) E(✓) S(x)\nGuess 4: pyrex -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) Y(x) R(✓) E(✓) X(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane
- C: x -> not in word
- R: - -> in word but not at position 1 (index 1)
- A: x -> not in word
- N: x -> not in word
- E: - -> in word but not at position 4 (index 4)

Guess 2: peril
- P: ✓ -> correct and at position 0
- E: - -> in word but not at position 1 (index 1)
- R: ✓ -> correct and at position 2 (index 2)
- I: x -> not in word
- L: x -> not in word

Guess 3: pores
- P: ✓ -> correct and at position 0
- O: x -> not in word
- R: ✓ -> correct and at position 2 (index 2)
- E: ✓ -> correct and at position 3 (index 3)
- S: x -> not in word

Guess 4: pyrex
- P: ✓ -> correct and at position 0
- Y: x -> not in word
- R: ✓ -> correct and at position 2 (index 2)
- E: ✓ -> correct and at position 3 (index 3)
- X: x -> not in word

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has:
   - First letter P (position 0)
   - Third letter R (position 2)
   - Fourth letter E (position 3)

2. The secret word is of the form: P _ R E _ 

3. Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, A, N, I, L, O, S, Y, X

4. The second letter (position 1) and the fifth letter (position 4) must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the eliminated letters.

5. Additionally, we know that:
   - R is not at position 1 (from crane feedback) -> satisfied because we have R at position 2.
   - E is not at position 1 or 4 -> satisfied because we have E at position 3.

The remaining letters available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, Z

We need to find a 5-letter English word that starts with P, has a letter from the available set at position 1, then R, E, and ends with a letter from the available set at position 4.

Common words that fit this pattern include:

- PRUDE: P, R, U, D, E -> but that has R at position 1? No, the pattern is P _ R E _. PRUDE is P, R, U, D, E -> positions: P(0), R(1), U(2), D(3), E(4) -> does not match because we need R at position 2 and E at position 3.

We require:
- Position 0: P
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: ?

So words of the form ""P?R E?""

Possible candidates:

- PREED? Not valid and uses E again? But we are at position 4? Also, E at position 4 is disallowed by crane feedback? Because E was at index 4 in crane and marked '-', meaning secret does not have E at 4? So position 4 cannot be E.

- Other words:

  - ""PURE"" (4 letters) -> not 5.
  - ""PURGE"": P, U, R, G, E -> 
      Position 0: P -> good
      Position 1: U -> good? 
      Position 2: R -> good? 
      Position 3: G -> but we need E at position 3? Here G is at 3? So not matching.

  We need position 3 to be E? In PURGE, E is at position 4? Which is disallowed? And also, structure is P,U,R,G,E? So E is at 4? 

  But we know from crane that E is not at 4? So any word with E at 4 is invalid? 

  Therefore, the only possibility is to have a different letter at 4? And letters at 1 and 4 are not eliminated? 

  Word: ""PRUDE"" doesn't fit structure? 

  What about ""PRET""? Not 5 letters? 

  Another: ""PRIED"" -> but I is eliminated? 

  ""PROED"" -> O eliminated.

  ""PRUED""? Not a word? 

  ""PRAED""? A eliminated.

  ""PREMI"" -> I eliminated and E at position 2? 

  We need E at position 3? 

  After the feedback, we have eliminated O, S, Y, X? And previous eliminations? 

  One common word that fits: ""PRATE"" -> but A is eliminated? 

  ""PRUTE""? Not common? 

  ""PLED""? Not 5 and L eliminated? 

  Then, what about ""PURED""? Not a valid word? 

  Another idea: ""P U R E D""? Not a standard word.

  Valid words: 
    - ""PREED"": not common?
    - ""PREMP"" not a word?

  But ""PYREX"" was guessed with Y and X eliminated? 

  Then what? Perhaps ""FUR"" not starting with P? 

  Or ""GREPT"" not word? 

  Solution: ""PRED"" not 5.

  Upon rethinking, one valid word is ""P R E S T"" -> but S eliminated? And structure: P,R,E,S,T? That’s P(0),R(1),E(2),S(3),T(4) -> but we need R at position 2? Here R is at1? And E at2? But we need E at3? So not.

  The only word I can think of that matches ""P?R E?"" is ""PURE"" expanded or something.

  But note: a common word is ""proud"" -> but that’s P,R,O,U,D? O eliminated.

  Another: ""PRUVED""? Not valid.

  Then ""PARER"" -> A eliminated.

  P?RE? must be ... ? 

  Word: ""P U R E B"" or ""P U R E M""? No? 

  ""P U R E E"" -> but E at4 disallowed? 

  Then ""P D R E B"" not word? 

  After searching, a valid word is ""P T E R E""? No, P at0? then T at1? R at2? E at3? Then E at4? Disallowed? 

  But ""PTERE"" isn't a word? 

  Another: ""P H R E I""-> I eliminated.

  Then ""P H R E T"" -> not common? 

  Perhaps ""PHRE"" not 5.

  We must remember: position 2 must be R? Not position 1? So the second letter of the word is the letter at position 1? And then R at position 2? Like P + second letter + R + E + last letter.

  Examples: 
    - ""PURE"" is only 4.
    - ""PURED"" is 5? But ""pured"" is not a valid English word? 
    - ""PURER"" -> R at position 4? And we have R already? But is it valid? 
        P U R E R: 
        Positions: 0:P, 1:U, 2:R, 3:E, 4:R
        This has E at3? So structure matches? But has R at4? So duplicate R? 

      Is ""PURER"" a valid word? Yes, meaning more pure.

      Now, check against eliminated letters:
        U is not eliminated? R at4 is not eliminated? 

      And feedback: 
        In crane, R was at index1 and got '-'? But in ""PURER"", R is at index2? And also at index4? Since it has duplicate R? 

      Then feedback for crane: 
        R is in the word? And at position1? But the secret here has R at2 and4? So R is present? And not at position1? So '-' is correct? 

      And from peril: E at index1? But in PURER, E is at3? So E is in the word but not at1? So '-' correct? 

      From pores and pyrex: no impact? 

      And we haven't tested U? So it's new.

      Therefore, ""PURER"" fits and is a valid word.

  Another possibility: ""PURET"" -> not common.

  But ""PURER"" is common.

  Therefore, we can guess ""PURER"".

  Note: We are not sure if there are duplicate letters? But it's allowed? 

  So next guess: ""PURER""Based on deduction:

- Secret word structure: `P _ R E _` (positions: 0=P, 2=R, 3=E).
- Eliminated letters: All guesses confirm **C, A, N, I, L, O, S, Y, X** are not in the word.
- Only two words fit the pattern using remaining letters: **""PURER""** (common) and possibly less common variants.
- **""PURER""** is chosen because:
  - Positions: `P (0)`, `U (1)`, `R (2)`, `E (3)`, `R (4)`.
  - U and the second R are not eliminated and align with feedback.
- This guess resolves the pattern efficiently with one unknown (position 1 and 4). If correct, all positions validate.

</think>
After analyzing all previous feedback:

1. **Confirmed positions**:  
   - **P** is at position 0 (index 0).  
   - **R** is at position 2 (index 2).  
   - **E** is at position 3 (index 3).  
   The word structure: **P \_ R E \_**.

2. **Eliminated letters**:  
   All previous guesses confirm these letters are **not** in the word:  
   - From `crane`: C, A, N  
   - From `peril`: I, L  
   - From `pores`: O, S  
   - From `pyrex`: Y, X  
   
   Cumulatively eliminated: **C, A, N, I, L, O, S, Y, X**.

3. **Key constraints**:  
   - The second letter (position 1) and fifth letter (position 4) must be chosen from the remaining letters: **B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, Z**.  
   - No additional feedback conflicts exist for E or R placements.

4. **Valid word selection**:  
   After testing possible candidates, **""PURER""** fits perfectly:  
   - P (position 0), U (position 1), R (position 2), E (position 3), R (position 4).  
   - **U** and the second **R** are uneliminated letters.  
   - This is a valid 5-letter English word (""purer"" = more pure).  

5. **Feedback consistency**:  
   - ""PURER"" satisfies all constraints:  
     - E is not at positions 1 or 4 (per `crane` and `peril` feedback).  
     - R is not at position 1 (per `crane` feedback).  
     - All eliminated letters are avoided.  

<guess>purer</guess>",purer,"We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane
- C: x -> not in word
- R: - -> in word but not at position 1 (index 1)
- A: x -> not in word
- N: x -> not in word
- E: - -> in word but not at position 4 (index 4)

Guess 2: peril
- P: ✓ -> correct and at position 0
- E: - -> in word but not at position 1 (index 1)
- R: ✓ -> correct and at position 2 (index 2)
- I: x -> not in word
- L: x -> not in word

Guess 3: pores
- P: ✓ -> correct and at position 0
- O: x -> not in word
- R: ✓ -> correct and at position 2 (index 2)
- E: ✓ -> correct and at position 3 (index 3)
- S: x -> not in word

Guess 4: pyrex
- P: ✓ -> correct and at position 0
- Y: x -> not in word
- R: ✓ -> correct and at position 2 (index 2)
- E: ✓ -> correct and at position 3 (index 3)
- X: x -> not in word

From this, we know:

1. The secret word has:
   - First letter P (position 0)
   - Third letter R (position 2)
   - Fourth letter E (position 3)

2. The secret word is of the form: P _ R E _ 

3. Eliminated letters (not in the word): C, A, N, I, L, O, S, Y, X

4. The second letter (position 1) and the fifth letter (position 4) must be from the remaining alphabet, excluding the eliminated letters.

5. Additionally, we know that:
   - R is not at position 1 (from crane feedback) -> satisfied because we have R at position 2.
   - E is not at position 1 or 4 -> satisfied because we have E at position 3.

The remaining letters available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, T, U, V, W, Z

We need to find a 5-letter English word that starts with P, has a letter from the available set at position 1, then R, E, and ends with a letter from the available set at position 4.

Common words that fit this pattern include:

- PRUDE: P, R, U, D, E -> but that has R at position 1? No, the pattern is P _ R E _. PRUDE is P, R, U, D, E -> positions: P(0), R(1), U(2), D(3), E(4) -> does not match because we need R at position 2 and E at position 3.

We require:
- Position 0: P
- Position 1: ?
- Position 2: R
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: ?

So words of the form ""P?R E?""

Possible candidates:

- PREED? Not valid and uses E again? But we are at position 4? Also, E at position 4 is disallowed by crane feedback? Because E was at index 4 in crane and marked '-', meaning secret does not have E at 4? So position 4 cannot be E.

- Other words:

  - ""PURE"" (4 letters) -> not 5.
  - ""PURGE"": P, U, R, G, E -> 
      Position 0: P -> good
      Position 1: U -> good? 
      Position 2: R -> good? 
      Position 3: G -> but we need E at position 3? Here G is at 3? So not matching.

  We need position 3 to be E? In PURGE, E is at position 4? Which is disallowed? And also, structure is P,U,R,G,E? So E is at 4? 

  But we know from crane that E is not at 4? So any word with E at 4 is invalid? 

  Therefore, the only possibility is to have a different letter at 4? And letters at 1 and 4 are not eliminated? 

  Word: ""PRUDE"" doesn't fit structure? 

  What about ""PRET""? Not 5 letters? 

  Another: ""PRIED"" -> but I is eliminated? 

  ""PROED"" -> O eliminated.

  ""PRUED""? Not a word? 

  ""PRAED""? A eliminated.

  ""PREMI"" -> I eliminated and E at position 2? 

  We need E at position 3? 

  After the feedback, we have eliminated O, S, Y, X? And previous eliminations? 

  One common word that fits: ""PRATE"" -> but A is eliminated? 

  ""PRUTE""? Not common? 

  ""PLED""? Not 5 and L eliminated? 

  Then, what about ""PURED""? Not a valid word? 

  Another idea: ""P U R E D""? Not a standard word.

  Valid words: 
    - ""PREED"": not common?
    - ""PREMP"" not a word?

  But ""PYREX"" was guessed with Y and X eliminated? 

  Then what? Perhaps ""FUR"" not starting with P? 

  Or ""GREPT"" not word? 

  Solution: ""PRED"" not 5.

  Upon rethinking, one valid word is ""P R E S T"" -> but S eliminated? And structure: P,R,E,S,T? That’s P(0),R(1),E(2),S(3),T(4) -> but we need R at position 2? Here R is at1? And E at2? But we need E at3? So not.

  The only word I can think of that matches ""P?R E?"" is ""PURE"" expanded or something.

  But note: a common word is ""proud"" -> but that’s P,R,O,U,D? O eliminated.

  Another: ""PRUVED""? Not valid.

  Then ""PARER"" -> A eliminated.

  P?RE? must be ... ? 

  Word: ""P U R E B"" or ""P U R E M""? No? 

  ""P U R E E"" -> but E at4 disallowed? 

  Then ""P D R E B"" not word? 

  After searching, a valid word is ""P T E R E""? No, P at0? then T at1? R at2? E at3? Then E at4? Disallowed? 

  But ""PTERE"" isn't a word? 

  Another: ""P H R E I""-> I eliminated.

  Then ""P H R E T"" -> not common? 

  Perhaps ""PHRE"" not 5.

  We must remember: position 2 must be R? Not position 1? So the second letter of the word is the letter at position 1? And then R at position 2? Like P + second letter + R + E + last letter.

  Examples: 
    - ""PURE"" is only 4.
    - ""PURED"" is 5? But ""pured"" is not a valid English word? 
    - ""PURER"" -> R at position 4? And we have R already? But is it valid? 
        P U R E R: 
        Positions: 0:P, 1:U, 2:R, 3:E, 4:R
        This has E at3? So structure matches? But has R at4? So duplicate R? 

      Is ""PURER"" a valid word? Yes, meaning more pure.

      Now, check against eliminated letters:
        U is not eliminated? R at4 is not eliminated? 

      And feedback: 
        In crane, R was at index1 and got '-'? But in ""PURER"", R is at index2? And also at index4? Since it has duplicate R? 

      Then feedback for crane: 
        R is in the word? And at position1? But the secret here has R at2 and4? So R is present? And not at position1? So '-' is correct? 

      And from peril: E at index1? But in PURER, E is at3? So E is in the word but not at1? So '-' correct? 

      From pores and pyrex: no impact? 

      And we haven't tested U? So it's new.

      Therefore, ""PURER"" fits and is a valid word.

  Another possibility: ""PURET"" -> not common.

  But ""PURER"" is common.

  Therefore, we can guess ""PURER"".

  Note: We are not sure if there are duplicate letters? But it's allowed? 

  So next guess: ""PURER""Based on deduction:
