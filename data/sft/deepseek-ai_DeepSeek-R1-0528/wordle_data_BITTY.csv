We are just starting the game. We haven't any feedback yet, so we need to make a strategic first guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally 5 distinct letters to maximize information.

 Common starting words in word games include: CRANE, SLATE, ROAST, etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has common letters: C, R, A, N, E
 - All letters are distinct.

 So, I will guess ""CRANE"".
</think>
I am starting the game with no prior feedback. For an initial guess, selecting a word with common letters maximizes information gain. ""CRANE"" is an optimal choice because it contains five distinct letters including frequent ones (A, E, R) and less common consonants (C, N). This spread helps efficiently reveal positional accuracy for the secret word.

We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""crane"" and all letters were marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to pick a word with 5 new letters. We should aim for common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C,R,A,N,E) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 A good starting point might be to use a word with high-frequency letters that we haven't tried.

 Let's consider words like: ""SLIMY"", ""TOUGH"", ""PUDGY"", etc. But we want to maximize coverage of new letters.

 Another popular second guess after eliminating 5 letters is to use another set of common letters.

 Let me think of a word that uses common letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}. For example:

 S, T, L, O, P, I, D, M, H, B, etc.

 I can try ""SPLIT"" but that has I and T which are common. However, let's check if we can get more coverage.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has M, O, I, S, T — all common letters and none of the excluded ones.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

 Since we have no information, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me choose ""MOIST"":

 M, O, I, S, T — all new.

 However, if we are avoiding the letters from the first guess, then yes.

 Another option: ""PUDGY"" — P, U, D, G, Y — but Y is less common.

 Or ""LUCKY"" — but we know C is already out? Yes, C is out.

 Actually, we must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, ""MOIST"" is valid.

 But let's consider frequency. According to English letter frequency, after removing C,R,A,N,E, the next most common are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, H, etc.

 We can try to cover S, T, L, O, I.

 The word ""TOILS"" or ""SOILT"" — but ""SOILT"" is not a word. ""SLOTH"" is a word: S, L, O, T, H — that covers 5 new letters including H.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T.

 But I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T — which are all high frequency.

 However, note that we are in the second guess and we have 5 new letters. We want to maximize the chance of getting hits.

 Let me check: the most common letters in 5-letter words (without C,R,A,N,E) are:

 According to various sources, the top letters are: E, A, R, O, T, I, S, N, etc. but we have excluded E,A,R,N. So the next are O, T, I, S, L, C (but C is out), so O, T, I, S, L.

 So a word with O, T, I, S, L would be ideal. But we can't have all in one word? Let's see:

 Words: ""TOILS"" (T, O, I, L, S) — that's 5 letters. Is ""TOILS"" a valid word? Yes, it is (plural of toil? or third person present of toil? but in word games, it's accepted).

 Alternatively, ""SLOTH"" (S, L, O, T, H) — H is less common.

 Or ""POINT"" — but P is not as common as S or T? and we have O, I, N (but N is excluded) — wait, N is excluded, so we cannot use N.

 So ""POINT"" has N which is excluded.

 Therefore, ""TOILS"" is a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S.

 But let me confirm: T, O, I, L, S — none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}. So it's valid.

 Another option: ""BUOYS"" — B, U, O, Y, S — but Y and U are less common.

 I think ""TOILS"" is a strong choice.

 However, note that we are only on the second guess and we have 4 more after this. We can also consider words that have more vowels? We have O and I (vowels) in ""TOILS"", and we already tried A and E and they are not in the word, so the vowels left are O, I, U. We have O and I in ""TOILS"".

 Alternatively, we could use ""OUPHS"" — but that's obscure.

 I think ""TOILS"" is acceptable.

 But let me see if there's a word that includes U as well? We have to cover 5 letters, so we can't cover everything.

 We can stick with ""TOILS"".

 However, to be safe, I'll choose ""MOIST"" because it's a common word and we get M as well, which is a common consonant.

 But note: M is less common than L? Actually, L is the 12th most common letter in English, M is 14th, so L is slightly more common. But in ""TOILS"" we have L and in ""MOIST"" we have M.

 Since we have no information, either is fine.

 I'll go with ""TOILS"" because it uses the top letters we have available: S, T, L, O, I.

 So, my second guess is ""TOILS"".
</think>
After the first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters (C, R, A, N, E) being marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. The new guess must avoid these letters and prioritize high-frequency English letters not yet tested. Common remaining letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, and H. 

The word ""TOILS"" is chosen because:
- It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters: T, O, I, L, S.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.
- It covers common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S), increasing the chance of hits.

This guess will help identify which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

For an initial guess, selecting a word with common letters maximizes information gain. ""CRANE"" is an optimal choice because it contains five distinct letters including frequent ones (A, E, R) and less common consonants (C, N). This spread helps efficiently reveal positional accuracy for the secret word.\n\n<guess>crane</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are on the second guess.

We should aim for common letters that haven\'t been tried yet.\n\n Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C,R,A,N,E) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, etc.\n\n A good starting point might be to use a word with high-frequency letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let\'s consider words like: ""SLIMY"", ""TOUGH"", ""PUDGY"", etc. But we want to maximize coverage of new letters.\n\n Another popular second guess after eliminating 5 letters is to use another set of common letters.\n\n Let me think of a word that uses common letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}. For example:\n\n S, T, L, O, P, I, D, M, H, B, etc.\n\n I can try ""SPLIT"" but that has I and T which are common. However, let\'s check if we can get more coverage.\n\n Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has M, O, I, S, T — all common letters and none of the excluded ones.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.\n\n Since we have no information, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me choose ""MOIST"":\n\n M, O, I, S, T — all new.\n\n However, if we are avoiding the letters from the first guess, then yes.\n\n Another option: ""PUDGY"" — P, U, D, G, Y — but Y is less common.\n\n Or ""LUCKY"" — but we know C is already out? Yes, C is out.\n\n Actually, we must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So, ""MOIST"" is valid.\n\n But let\'s consider frequency. According to English letter frequency, after removing C,R,A,N,E, the next most common are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, H, etc.\n\n We can try to cover S, T, L, O, I.\n\n The word ""TOILS"" or ""SOILT"" — but ""SOILT"" is not a word. ""SLOTH"" is a word: S, L, O, T, H — that covers 5 new letters including H.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T.\n\n But I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T — which are all high frequency.\n\n However, note that we are in the second guess and we have 5 new letters. We want to maximize the chance of getting hits.\n\n Let me check: the most common letters in 5-letter words (without C,R,A,N,E) are:\n\n According to various sources, the top letters are: E, A, R, O, T, I, S, N, etc. but we have excluded E,A,R,N. So the next are O, T, I, S, L, C (but C is out), so O, T, I, S, L.\n\n So a word with O, T, I, S, L would be ideal. But we can\'t have all in one word? Let\'s see:\n\n Words: ""TOILS"" (T, O, I, L, S) — that\'s 5 letters. Is ""TOILS"" a valid word? Yes, it is (plural of toil? or third person present of toil? but in word games, it\'s accepted).\n\n Alternatively, ""SLOTH"" (S, L, O, T, H) — H is less common.\n\n Or ""POINT"" — but P is not as common as S or T? and we have O, I, N (but N is excluded) — wait, N is excluded, so we cannot use N.\n\n So ""POINT"" has N which is excluded.\n\n Therefore, ""TOILS"" is a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S.\n\n But let me confirm: T, O, I, L, S — none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}. So it\'s valid.\n\n Another option: ""BUOYS"" — B, U, O, Y, S — but Y and U are less common.\n\n I think ""TOILS"" is a strong choice.\n\n However, note that we are only on the second guess and we have 4 more after this. We can also consider words that have more vowels? We have O and I (vowels) in ""TOILS"", and we already tried A and E and they are not in the word, so the vowels left are O, I, U. We have O and I in ""TOILS"".\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""OUPHS"" — but that\'s obscure.\n\n I think ""TOILS"" is acceptable.\n\n But let me see if there\'s a word that includes U as well? We have to cover 5 letters, so we can\'t cover everything.\n\n We can stick with ""TOILS"".\n\n However, to be safe, I\'ll choose ""MOIST"" because it\'s a common word and we get M as well, which is a common consonant.\n\n But note: M is less common than L? Actually, L is the 12th most common letter in English, M is 14th, so L is slightly more common. But in ""TOILS"" we have L and in ""MOIST"" we have M.\n\n Since we have no information, either is fine.\n\n I\'ll go with ""TOILS"" because it uses the top letters we have available: S, T, L, O, I.\n\n So, my second guess is ""TOILS"".After the first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters (C, R, A, N, E) being marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. The new guess must avoid these letters and prioritize high-frequency English letters not yet tested. Common remaining letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, and H. \n\nThe word ""TOILS"" is chosen because:\n- It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters: T, O, I, L, S.\n- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.\n- It covers common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S), increasing the chance of hits.\n\nThis guess will help identify which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>toils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect: so the secret word contains none of C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""toils"" -> T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)

From guess 2:
- T is in the word but not in the correct position (first position).
- O is not in the word.
- I is in the word but not in the correct position (third position).
- L is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.

So, letters that are in the secret word: T and I (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively).
Letters not in the word: O, L, S (and from guess 1: C, R, A, N, E).

Therefore, the set of excluded letters is: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.

Available letters: all others except these.

We know:
- The word contains T and I. T is not in position 1, I is not in position 3.
- Since T and I are present, and the word is 5 letters.

Also, note that in ""toils"", T was in position 1 and I in position 3, but those positions are wrong for these letters. So T must be in positions 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions 2, 4, or 5? The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

But T cannot be in position 1 (as in the guess). Similarly, I cannot be in position 3.

Now, T is present but not in position 1, and I is present but not in position 3.

We need to form a guess that:
- Does not use any excluded letters: so avoid C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.
- Must include T and I (since we know they are in the word, we should reuse them to find their positions).
- And we should try to include new letters to gain more information.

But note: we don't have to include T and I in every guess? Actually, no, we can guess without them, but since we know they are in the word, it's efficient to place them in positions we haven't tested to narrow down.

Moreover, we have 3 letters unknown: since T and I are already present, there are 3 other letters in the word to discover.

Now, what positions are available for T? It can be in 2, 3, 4, or 5? But we don't know about position 2 yet. In the second guess, T was in position 1, so position 1 is wrong. But that doesn't tell us about other positions. So T must appear in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? And similarly, I must appear in position 1,2,4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong).

But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any indication, so we'll assume no duplicates for now.

Let's list the available letters: excluding C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S, we have:
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know I and T are in the word, so they can be reused? But we don't yet know about others.

Now, we want to form a word that includes T and I, and three new letters to test.

We also know that T cannot be in position 1 (from the first letter of guess 2), and I cannot be in position 3.

In our new guess, we can try placing T in a different position to see if we get a ✓ or a -.

Similarly for I.

A good strategy: place T in position 2 or 4? Since position 1 is excluded for T, and in the second guess we didn't test T in position 2.

Similarly, for I: avoid position 3, so try in position 1,2,4, or 5.

But we also need to pick three new letters.

Let me think of common words that fit.

We can aim for a word that has T and I and three common letters: like D, H, M, P, etc.

For example, pick letters: D, H, M, along with T and I.

Then form a word: possible words?
- Must be 5 letters, and avoid C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S.

Possible word: ""THUMB""? But U is available? ""THUMB"" has T,H,U,M,B. But we need to include I? Oh, I forgot we must include I.

So we need a word that has T, I, and three other new letters.

Let me try: ""MIGHT"" -> M,I,G,H,T. However, that has I in position 2 and T in position 5.

But position 3? We put G there.

Available letters: we haven't excluded B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

""might"" is M-I-G-H-T.

But note: we know I cannot be in position 3? Actually, in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but in our guess, we can put I anywhere? We are testing new positions.

In this guess, we can put I in position 2? That's allowed because we haven't tested I in position 2.

Similarly, T in position 5.

But we aren't sure what positions they are in.

Another word: ""PITHY"" -> P,I,T,H,Y. But that has I in position 2 and T in position 3? We want to avoid putting I in position 3? Actually, no, we are guessing — we can put I in position 3? The feedback will tell us if it's correct or not.

However, we know from previous feedback that the secret word's I is not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will get an x for sure? Actually, no: because we already know I is not in position 3? So we'd get a - if it were present but in wrong position, but we put it in the wrong position? It might be inefficient.

But note the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, we get ✓. Otherwise, if it's in the word but wrong position, we get -.

We know I is in the word, but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will never get ✓, only - or x? Actually, since we know it's not position 3, if we put it there, it should give us - (because it is in the word but wrong position). So we wouldn't learn much except that it's not there, which we already know.

Similarly for T: we know it's not in position 1.

To avoid redundant information, we should avoid putting T in position 1 and I in position 3.

Therefore, in our new guess, place T in positions 2,3,4,5 but not 1. And I in positions 1,2,4,5 but not 3.

Let me think of a word that meets these conditions.

Also, we want to use common letters not yet tested.

So: for example, T in position 2: then ? T ? ? ?

Or T in position 4: then ? ? ? T ?

Similarly for I.

One idea: put I in position 1 and T in position 4? Or to maximize information, put them in positions that we haven't ruled out.

Try: I in position 1, T in position 5, and then three new letters.

So: I _ _ _ T

What words? Like ""INPUT"" but N and P? N is excluded (from guess 1: N is not in word).

N is excluded, so not available.

""QUIET"" but Q and U? Also, E is excluded.

Avoid E.

""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T. That works: F, I, G, H, T.
- Positions: I in position 2? ""FIGHT"" is F-I-G-H-T, so I is in position 2, T in position 5.

That works.

Also, ""FIGHT"" uses F which is new, G, H, T, I.

T is reused, I is reused.

Also, positions: I is in position 2 (we haven't tested I in position 2), T in position 5 (we haven't tested T in position 5).

Moreover, we haven't tested F, G, H.

So this seems good.

Another word: ""MIGHT"" as before: M,I,G,H,T. Same positions.

But ""FIGHT"" is valid.

Is there a word with T in position 2? Like ""BOTHY"" but O is excluded and we need I? Doesn't work.

""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> positions: P in 1, I in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5.
But we have T in position 3? We haven't tested T in position 3.

And I in position 2? Also fine.

But note: we know I is present and T is present, so both are in the word.

In ""PITHY"", if we put T in position 3, that might be acceptable because we haven't tested that position for T.

But we must avoid I in position 3? Not necessary for the guess? We can put T in position 3? But we don't know if T is in position 3? It could be.

But note: in the feedback rule, if it is in the correct position, we get ✓.

So it's acceptable.

However, comparing ""FIGHT"" and ""PITHY"", both cover similar letters.

But ""FIGHT"" tests F, which might be less common? Actually, H is common.

Also, in ""PITHY"", we have Y which is less common.

So ""FIGHT"" might be better.

Another word: ""WIGHT"" (a mythical being) - but rare? Avoid rare words? We want common words.

""FIGHT"" is common.

Alternatively, ""DIGHT""? Not common.

""TIGHT"" - but T in position 1: but we cannot have T in position 1! Because we know T is not in the correct position if placed first? Actually, we already got - for T in position 1, meaning it's present but not in first position. But we can put T in the first position? We would get a - again? Because we already know it's not first position.

But that would be inefficient: if we put T in position 1, we know it will be - for sure.

Similarly, avoid that.

So ""TIGHT"" starts with T -> position 1: T, but we know T isn't in position 1, so it would be - or x? Present but wrong position -> so we'd get -, which we already know. So wasteful.

Therefore, avoid placing T in position 1 and I in position 3.

Back to ""FIGHT"": letters F,I,G,H,T.

Positions: 
1: F (new)
2: I (we haven't tested position 2 for I)
3: G (new)
4: H (new)
5: T (we haven't tested position 5 for T)

This tests I in position 2 and T in position 5, which were not tested before.

We might get hits.

Another possibility: ""PUPIL"" but U is not very common? and L is excluded. Wait, L is excluded? From guess 2: L(x) -> not in word.

So we cannot use L.

""MUMMY"" has duplicate M? Not efficient.

""DUVET"" has D,U,V,E,T? But E is excluded.

So ""FIGHT"" seems good.

But let me check if the word ""FIGHT"" is allowed: yes, it's a standard English word.

Final guess: ""FIGHT"".

However, note: from feedback we have T(-) meaning T is in the word but not in first position. We haven't tested T in position 5, so we do that.

Similarly for I: in guess 2, I was in position 3 and got -, meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. Now we try it in position 2.

We also test F, G, H.

This maximizes new information.

So let's go with that.
</think>
From the feedback:
- In Guess 1 (""crane""), all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are excluded.
- In Guess 2 (""toils""), T is present but in the wrong position (-), O is absent (x), I is present but in the wrong position (-), L is absent (x), and S is absent (x). This means O, L, and S are excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.  
Confirmed present letters: T and I, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.

The new guess must include T and I (to locate their correct positions) and avoid excluded letters. T cannot be placed in position 1, and I cannot be placed in position 3. To maximize information gain, I placed I in position 2 (untested) and T in position 5 (untested), while introducing three new common letters: F, G, H.

The word ""FIGHT"" meets these criteria:  
- Positions: F (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5).  
- Avoids excluded letters and reuses T and I in new positions.  
- Tests F, G, and H for the first time.

<guess>fight</guess>",fight,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect: so the secret word contains none of C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""toils"" -> T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)

From guess 2:
- T is in the word but not in the correct position (first position).
- O is not in the word.
- I is in the word but not in the correct position (third position).
- L is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.

So, letters that are in the secret word: T and I (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively).
Letters not in the word: O, L, S (and from guess 1: C, R, A, N, E).

Therefore, the set of excluded letters is: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.

Available letters: all others except these.

We know:
- The word contains T and I. T is not in position 1, I is not in position 3.
- Since T and I are present, and the word is 5 letters.

Also, note that in ""toils"", T was in position 1 and I in position 3, but those positions are wrong for these letters. So T must be in positions 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions 2, 4, or 5? The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

But T cannot be in position 1 (as in the guess). Similarly, I cannot be in position 3.

Now, T is present but not in position 1, and I is present but not in position 3.

We need to form a guess that:
- Does not use any excluded letters: so avoid C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.
- Must include T and I (since we know they are in the word, we should reuse them to find their positions).
- And we should try to include new letters to gain more information.

But note: we don't have to include T and I in every guess? Actually, no, we can guess without them, but since we know they are in the word, it's efficient to place them in positions we haven't tested to narrow down.

Moreover, we have 3 letters unknown: since T and I are already present, there are 3 other letters in the word to discover.

Now, what positions are available for T? It can be in 2, 3, 4, or 5? But we don't know about position 2 yet. In the second guess, T was in position 1, so position 1 is wrong. But that doesn't tell us about other positions. So T must appear in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? And similarly, I must appear in position 1,2,4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong).

But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any indication, so we'll assume no duplicates for now.

Let's list the available letters: excluding C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S, we have:
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know I and T are in the word, so they can be reused? But we don't yet know about others.

Now, we want to form a word that includes T and I, and three new letters to test.

We also know that T cannot be in position 1 (from the first letter of guess 2), and I cannot be in position 3.

In our new guess, we can try placing T in a different position to see if we get a ✓ or a -.

Similarly for I.

A good strategy: place T in position 2 or 4? Since position 1 is excluded for T, and in the second guess we didn't test T in position 2.

Similarly, for I: avoid position 3, so try in position 1,2,4, or 5.

But we also need to pick three new letters.

Let me think of common words that fit.

We can aim for a word that has T and I and three common letters: like D, H, M, P, etc.

For example, pick letters: D, H, M, along with T and I.

Then form a word: possible words?
- Must be 5 letters, and avoid C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S.

Possible word: ""THUMB""? But U is available? ""THUMB"" has T,H,U,M,B. But we need to include I? Oh, I forgot we must include I.

So we need a word that has T, I, and three other new letters.

Let me try: ""MIGHT"" -> M,I,G,H,T. However, that has I in position 2 and T in position 5.

But position 3? We put G there.

Available letters: we haven't excluded B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

""might"" is M-I-G-H-T.

But note: we know I cannot be in position 3? Actually, in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but in our guess, we can put I anywhere? We are testing new positions.

In this guess, we can put I in position 2? That's allowed because we haven't tested I in position 2.

Similarly, T in position 5.

But we aren't sure what positions they are in.

Another word: ""PITHY"" -> P,I,T,H,Y. But that has I in position 2 and T in position 3? We want to avoid putting I in position 3? Actually, no, we are guessing — we can put I in position 3? The feedback will tell us if it's correct or not.

However, we know from previous feedback that the secret word's I is not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will get an x for sure? Actually, no: because we already know I is not in position 3? So we'd get a - if it were present but in wrong position, but we put it in the wrong position? It might be inefficient.

But note the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, we get ✓. Otherwise, if it's in the word but wrong position, we get -.

We know I is in the word, but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will never get ✓, only - or x? Actually, since we know it's not position 3, if we put it there, it should give us - (because it is in the word but wrong position). So we wouldn't learn much except that it's not there, which we already know.

Similarly for T: we know it's not in position 1.

To avoid redundant information, we should avoid putting T in position 1 and I in position 3.

Therefore, in our new guess, place T in positions 2,3,4,5 but not 1. And I in positions 1,2,4,5 but not 3.

Let me think of a word that meets these conditions.

Also, we want to use common letters not yet tested.

So: for example, T in position 2: then ? T ? ? ?

Or T in position 4: then ? ? ? T ?

Similarly for I.

One idea: put I in position 1 and T in position 4? Or to maximize information, put them in positions that we haven't ruled out.

Try: I in position 1, T in position 5, and then three new letters.

So: I _ _ _ T

What words? Like ""INPUT"" but N and P? N is excluded (from guess 1: N is not in word).

N is excluded, so not available.

""QUIET"" but Q and U? Also, E is excluded.

Avoid E.

""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T. That works: F, I, G, H, T.
- Positions: I in position 2? ""FIGHT"" is F-I-G-H-T, so I is in position 2, T in position 5.

That works.

Also, ""FIGHT"" uses F which is new, G, H, T, I.

Also, positions: I is in position 2 (we haven't tested I in position 2), T in position 5 (we haven't tested T in position 5).

Moreover, we haven't tested F, G, H.

So this seems good.

Another word: ""MIGHT"" as before: M,I,G,H,T. Same positions.

But ""FIGHT"" is valid.

Is there a word with T in position 2? Like ""BOTHY"" but O is excluded and we need I? Doesn't work.

""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> positions: P in 1, I in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5.
But we have T in position 3? We haven't tested T in position 3.

And I in position 2? Also fine.

But note: we know I is present and T is present, so both are in the word.

In ""PITHY"", if we put T in position 3, that might be acceptable because we haven't tested that position for T.

But we must avoid I in position 3? Not necessary for the guess? We can put T in position 3? But we don't know if T is in position 3? It could be.

But note: in the feedback rule, if it is in the correct position, we get ✓.

So it's acceptable.

However, comparing ""FIGHT"" and ""PITHY"", both cover similar letters.

But ""FIGHT"" tests F, which might be less common? Actually, H is common.

Also, in ""PITHY"", we have Y which is less common.

So ""FIGHT"" might be better.

Another word: ""WIGHT"" (a mythical being) - but rare? Avoid rare words? We want common words.

""FIGHT"" is common.

Alternatively, ""DIGHT""? Not common.

""TIGHT"" - but T in position 1: but we cannot have T in position 1! Because we know T is not in the correct position if placed first? Actually, we already got - for T in position 1, meaning it's present but not in first position. But we can put T in the first position? We would get a - again? Because we already know it's not first position.

But that would be inefficient: if we put T in position 1, we know it will be - for sure.

Similarly, avoid that.

So ""TIGHT"" starts with T -> position 1: T, but we know T isn't in position 1, so it would be - or x? Present but wrong position -> so we'd get -, which we already know. So wasteful.

Therefore, avoid placing T in position 1 and I in position 3.

Back to ""FIGHT"": letters F,I,G,H,T.

Positions: 
1: F (new)
2: I (we haven't tested position 2 for I)
3: G (new)
4: H (new)
5: T (we haven't tested position 5 for T)

This tests I in position 2 and T in position 5, which were not tested before.

We might get hits.

Another possibility: ""PUPIL"" but U is not very common? and L is excluded. Wait, L is excluded? From guess 2: L(x) -> not in word.

So we cannot use L.

""MUMMY"" has duplicate M? Not efficient.

""DUVET"" has D,U,V,E,T? But E is excluded.

So ""FIGHT"" seems good.

But let me check if the word ""FIGHT"" is allowed: yes, it's a standard English word.

Final guess: ""FIGHT"".

However, note: from feedback we have T(-) meaning T is in the word but not in first position. We haven't tested T in position 5, so we do that.

Similarly for I: in guess 2, I was in position 3 and got -, meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. Now we try it in position 2.

We also test F, G, H.

This maximizes new information.

So let's go with that.From the feedback:
- In Guess 1 (""crane""), all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are excluded.
- In Guess 2 (""toils""), T is present but in the wrong position (-), O is absent (x), I is present but in the wrong position (-), L is absent (x), and S is absent (x). This means O, L, and S are excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.  
Confirmed present letters: T and I, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.

The new guess must include T and I (to locate their correct positions) and avoid excluded letters. T cannot be placed in position 1, and I cannot be placed in position 3. To maximize information gain, I placed I in position 2 (untested) and T in position 5 (untested), while introducing three new common letters: F, G, H.

The word ""FIGHT"" meets these criteria:  
- Positions: F (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5).  
- Avoids excluded letters and reuses T and I in new positions.  
- Tests F, G, and H for the first time.",Guess 3: fight -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are just starting the game. We haven't any feedback yet, so we need to make a strategic first guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally 5 distinct letters to maximize information.

 Common starting words in word games include: CRANE, SLATE, ROAST, etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has common letters: C, R, A, N, E
 - All letters are distinct.

 So, I will guess ""CRANE"".I am starting the game with no prior feedback. For an initial guess, selecting a word with common letters maximizes information gain. ""CRANE"" is an optimal choice because it contains five distinct letters including frequent ones (A, E, R) and less common consonants (C, N). This spread helps efficiently reveal positional accuracy for the secret word.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""crane"" and all letters were marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to pick a word with 5 new letters. We should aim for common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C,R,A,N,E) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 A good starting point might be to use a word with high-frequency letters that we haven't tried.

 Let's consider words like: ""SLIMY"", ""TOUGH"", ""PUDGY"", etc. But we want to maximize coverage of new letters.

 Another popular second guess after eliminating 5 letters is to use another set of common letters.

 Let me think of a word that uses common letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}. For example:

 S, T, L, O, P, I, D, M, H, B, etc.

 I can try ""SPLIT"" but that has I and T which are common. However, let's check if we can get more coverage.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has M, O, I, S, T — all common letters and none of the excluded ones.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

 Since we have no information, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me choose ""MOIST"":

 M, O, I, S, T — all new.

 However, if we are avoiding the letters from the first guess, then yes.

 Another option: ""PUDGY"" — P, U, D, G, Y — but Y is less common.

 Or ""LUCKY"" — but we know C is already out? Yes, C is out.

 Actually, we must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, ""MOIST"" is valid.

 But let's consider frequency. According to English letter frequency, after removing C,R,A,N,E, the next most common are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, H, etc.

 We can try to cover S, T, L, O, I.

 The word ""TOILS"" or ""SOILT"" — but ""SOILT"" is not a word. ""SLOTH"" is a word: S, L, O, T, H — that covers 5 new letters including H.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T.

 But I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T — which are all high frequency.

 However, note that we are in the second guess and we have 5 new letters. We want to maximize the chance of getting hits.

 Let me check: the most common letters in 5-letter words (without C,R,A,N,E) are:

 According to various sources, the top letters are: E, A, R, O, T, I, S, N, etc. but we have excluded E,A,R,N. So the next are O, T, I, S, L, C (but C is out), so O, T, I, S, L.

 So a word with O, T, I, S, L would be ideal. But we can't have all in one word? Let's see:

 Words: ""TOILS"" (T, O, I, L, S) — that's 5 letters. Is ""TOILS"" a valid word? Yes, it is (plural of toil? or third person present of toil? but in word games, it's accepted).

 Alternatively, ""SLOTH"" (S, L, O, T, H) — H is less common.

 Or ""POINT"" — but P is not as common as S or T? and we have O, I, N (but N is excluded) — wait, N is excluded, so we cannot use N.

 So ""POINT"" has N which is excluded.

 Therefore, ""TOILS"" is a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S.

 But let me confirm: T, O, I, L, S — none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}. So it's valid.

 Another option: ""BUOYS"" — B, U, O, Y, S — but Y and U are less common.

 I think ""TOILS"" is a strong choice.

 However, note that we are only on the second guess and we have 4 more after this. We can also consider words that have more vowels? We have O and I (vowels) in ""TOILS"", and we already tried A and E and they are not in the word, so the vowels left are O, I, U. We have O and I in ""TOILS"".

 Alternatively, we could use ""OUPHS"" — but that's obscure.

 I think ""TOILS"" is acceptable.

 But let me see if there's a word that includes U as well? We have to cover 5 letters, so we can't cover everything.

 We can stick with ""TOILS"".

 However, to be safe, I'll choose ""MOIST"" because it's a common word and we get M as well, which is a common consonant.

 But note: M is less common than L? Actually, L is the 12th most common letter in English, M is 14th, so L is slightly more common. But in ""TOILS"" we have L and in ""MOIST"" we have M.

 Since we have no information, either is fine.

 I'll go with ""TOILS"" because it uses the top letters we have available: S, T, L, O, I.

 So, my second guess is ""TOILS"".After the first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters (C, R, A, N, E) being marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. The new guess must avoid these letters and prioritize high-frequency English letters not yet tested. Common remaining letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, and H. 

The word ""TOILS"" is chosen because:
- It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters: T, O, I, L, S.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.
- It covers common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S), increasing the chance of hits.

This guess will help identify which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>toils</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect: so the secret word contains none of C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""toils"" -> T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)

From guess 2:
- T is in the word but not in the correct position (first position).
- O is not in the word.
- I is in the word but not in the correct position (third position).
- L is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.

So, letters that are in the secret word: T and I (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively).
Letters not in the word: O, L, S (and from guess 1: C, R, A, N, E).

Therefore, the set of excluded letters is: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.

Available letters: all others except these.

We know:
- The word contains T and I. T is not in position 1, I is not in position 3.
- Since T and I are present, and the word is 5 letters.

Also, note that in ""toils"", T was in position 1 and I in position 3, but those positions are wrong for these letters. So T must be in positions 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions 2, 4, or 5? The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

But T cannot be in position 1 (as in the guess). Similarly, I cannot be in position 3.

Now, T is present but not in position 1, and I is present but not in position 3.

We need to form a guess that:
- Does not use any excluded letters: so avoid C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.
- Must include T and I (since we know they are in the word, we should reuse them to find their positions).
- And we should try to include new letters to gain more information.

But note: we don't have to include T and I in every guess? Actually, no, we can guess without them, but since we know they are in the word, it's efficient to place them in positions we haven't tested to narrow down.

Moreover, we have 3 letters unknown: since T and I are already present, there are 3 other letters in the word to discover.

Now, what positions are available for T? It can be in 2, 3, 4, or 5? But we don't know about position 2 yet. In the second guess, T was in position 1, so position 1 is wrong. But that doesn't tell us about other positions. So T must appear in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? And similarly, I must appear in position 1,2,4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong).

But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any indication, so we'll assume no duplicates for now.

Let's list the available letters: excluding C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S, we have:
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know I and T are in the word, so they can be reused? But we don't yet know about others.

Now, we want to form a word that includes T and I, and three new letters to test.

We also know that T cannot be in position 1 (from the first letter of guess 2), and I cannot be in position 3.

In our new guess, we can try placing T in a different position to see if we get a ✓ or a -.

Similarly for I.

A good strategy: place T in position 2 or 4? Since position 1 is excluded for T, and in the second guess we didn't test T in position 2.

Similarly, for I: avoid position 3, so try in position 1,2,4, or 5.

But we also need to pick three new letters.

Let me think of common words that fit.

We can aim for a word that has T and I and three common letters: like D, H, M, P, etc.

For example, pick letters: D, H, M, along with T and I.

Then form a word: possible words?
- Must be 5 letters, and avoid C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S.

Possible word: ""THUMB""? But U is available? ""THUMB"" has T,H,U,M,B. But we need to include I? Oh, I forgot we must include I.

So we need a word that has T, I, and three other new letters.

Let me try: ""MIGHT"" -> M,I,G,H,T. However, that has I in position 2 and T in position 5.

But position 3? We put G there.

Available letters: we haven't excluded B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

""might"" is M-I-G-H-T.

But note: we know I cannot be in position 3? Actually, in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but in our guess, we can put I anywhere? We are testing new positions.

In this guess, we can put I in position 2? That's allowed because we haven't tested I in position 2.

Similarly, T in position 5.

But we aren't sure what positions they are in.

Another word: ""PITHY"" -> P,I,T,H,Y. But that has I in position 2 and T in position 3? We want to avoid putting I in position 3? Actually, no, we are guessing — we can put I in position 3? The feedback will tell us if it's correct or not.

However, we know from previous feedback that the secret word's I is not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will get an x for sure? Actually, no: because we already know I is not in position 3? So we'd get a - if it were present but in wrong position, but we put it in the wrong position? It might be inefficient.

But note the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, we get ✓. Otherwise, if it's in the word but wrong position, we get -.

We know I is in the word, but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will never get ✓, only - or x? Actually, since we know it's not position 3, if we put it there, it should give us - (because it is in the word but wrong position). So we wouldn't learn much except that it's not there, which we already know.

Similarly for T: we know it's not in position 1.

To avoid redundant information, we should avoid putting T in position 1 and I in position 3.

Therefore, in our new guess, place T in positions 2,3,4,5 but not 1. And I in positions 1,2,4,5 but not 3.

Let me think of a word that meets these conditions.

Also, we want to use common letters not yet tested.

So: for example, T in position 2: then ? T ? ? ?

Or T in position 4: then ? ? ? T ?

Similarly for I.

One idea: put I in position 1 and T in position 4? Or to maximize information, put them in positions that we haven't ruled out.

Try: I in position 1, T in position 5, and then three new letters.

So: I _ _ _ T

What words? Like ""INPUT"" but N and P? N is excluded (from guess 1: N is not in word).

N is excluded, so not available.

""QUIET"" but Q and U? Also, E is excluded.

Avoid E.

""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T. That works: F, I, G, H, T.
- Positions: I in position 2? ""FIGHT"" is F-I-G-H-T, so I is in position 2, T in position 5.

That works.

Also, ""FIGHT"" uses F which is new, G, H, T, I.

T is reused, I is reused.

Also, positions: I is in position 2 (we haven't tested I in position 2), T in position 5 (we haven't tested T in position 5).

Moreover, we haven't tested F, G, H.

So this seems good.

Another word: ""MIGHT"" as before: M,I,G,H,T. Same positions.

But ""FIGHT"" is valid.

Is there a word with T in position 2? Like ""BOTHY"" but O is excluded and we need I? Doesn't work.

""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> positions: P in 1, I in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5.
But we have T in position 3? We haven't tested T in position 3.

And I in position 2? Also fine.

But note: we know I is present and T is present, so both are in the word.

In ""PITHY"", if we put T in position 3, that might be acceptable because we haven't tested that position for T.

But we must avoid I in position 3? Not necessary for the guess? We can put T in position 3? But we don't know if T is in position 3? It could be.

But note: in the feedback rule, if it is in the correct position, we get ✓.

So it's acceptable.

However, comparing ""FIGHT"" and ""PITHY"", both cover similar letters.

But ""FIGHT"" tests F, which might be less common? Actually, H is common.

Also, in ""PITHY"", we have Y which is less common.

So ""FIGHT"" might be better.

Another word: ""WIGHT"" (a mythical being) - but rare? Avoid rare words? We want common words.

""FIGHT"" is common.

Alternatively, ""DIGHT""? Not common.

""TIGHT"" - but T in position 1: but we cannot have T in position 1! Because we know T is not in the correct position if placed first? Actually, we already got - for T in position 1, meaning it's present but not in first position. But we can put T in the first position? We would get a - again? Because we already know it's not first position.

But that would be inefficient: if we put T in position 1, we know it will be - for sure.

Similarly, avoid that.

So ""TIGHT"" starts with T -> position 1: T, but we know T isn't in position 1, so it would be - or x? Present but wrong position -> so we'd get -, which we already know. So wasteful.

Therefore, avoid placing T in position 1 and I in position 3.

Back to ""FIGHT"": letters F,I,G,H,T.

Positions: 
1: F (new)
2: I (we haven't tested position 2 for I)
3: G (new)
4: H (new)
5: T (we haven't tested position 5 for T)

This tests I in position 2 and T in position 5, which were not tested before.

We might get hits.

Another possibility: ""PUPIL"" but U is not very common? and L is excluded. Wait, L is excluded? From guess 2: L(x) -> not in word.

So we cannot use L.

""MUMMY"" has duplicate M? Not efficient.

""DUVET"" has D,U,V,E,T? But E is excluded.

So ""FIGHT"" seems good.

But let me check if the word ""FIGHT"" is allowed: yes, it's a standard English word.

Final guess: ""FIGHT"".

However, note: from feedback we have T(-) meaning T is in the word but not in first position. We haven't tested T in position 5, so we do that.

Similarly for I: in guess 2, I was in position 3 and got -, meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. Now we try it in position 2.

We also test F, G, H.

This maximizes new information.

So let's go with that.From the feedback:
- In Guess 1 (""crane""), all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are excluded.
- In Guess 2 (""toils""), T is present but in the wrong position (-), O is absent (x), I is present but in the wrong position (-), L is absent (x), and S is absent (x). This means O, L, and S are excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.  
Confirmed present letters: T and I, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.

The new guess must include T and I (to locate their correct positions) and avoid excluded letters. T cannot be placed in position 1, and I cannot be placed in position 3. To maximize information gain, I placed I in position 2 (untested) and T in position 5 (untested), while introducing three new common letters: F, G, H.

The word ""FIGHT"" meets these criteria:  
- Positions: F (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5).  
- Avoids excluded letters and reuses T and I in new positions.  
- Tests F, G, and H for the first time.

Yes, it is (plural of toil? or third person present of toil? but in word games, it\'s accepted).\n\n Alternatively, ""SLOTH"" (S, L, O, T, H) — H is less common.\n\n Or ""POINT"" — but P is not as common as S or T? and we have O, I, N (but N is excluded) — wait, N is excluded, so we cannot use N.\n\n So ""POINT"" has N which is excluded.\n\n Therefore, ""TOILS"" is a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S.\n\n But let me confirm: T, O, I, L, S — none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}. So it\'s valid.\n\n Another option: ""BUOYS"" — B, U, O, Y, S — but Y and U are less common.\n\n I think ""TOILS"" is a strong choice.\n\n However, note that we are only on the second guess and we have 4 more after this. We can also consider words that have more vowels? We have O and I (vowels) in ""TOILS"", and we already tried A and E and they are not in the word, so the vowels left are O, I, U. We have O and I in ""TOILS"".\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""OUPHS"" — but that\'s obscure.\n\n I think ""TOILS"" is acceptable.\n\n But let me see if there\'s a word that includes U as well? We have to cover 5 letters, so we can\'t cover everything.\n\n We can stick with ""TOILS"".\n\n However, to be safe, I\'ll choose ""MOIST"" because it\'s a common word and we get M as well, which is a common consonant.\n\n But note: M is less common than L? Actually, L is the 12th most common letter in English, M is 14th, so L is slightly more common. But in ""TOILS"" we have L and in ""MOIST"" we have M.\n\n Since we have no information, either is fine.\n\n I\'ll go with ""TOILS"" because it uses the top letters we have available: S, T, L, O, I.\n\n So, my second guess is ""TOILS"".After the first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters (C, R, A, N, E) being marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. The new guess must avoid these letters and prioritize high-frequency English letters not yet tested. Common remaining letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, and H. \n\nThe word ""TOILS"" is chosen because:\n- It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters: T, O, I, L, S.\n- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.\n- It covers common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S), increasing the chance of hits.\n\nThis guess will help identify which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>toils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1. ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect: so the secret word contains none of C, R, A, N, E.\n2. ""toils"" -> T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)\n\nFrom guess 2:\n- T is in the word but not in the correct position (first position).\n- O is not in the word.\n- I is in the word but not in the correct position (third position).\n- L is not in the word.\n- S is not in the word.\n\nSo, letters that are in the secret word: T and I (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively).\nLetters not in the word: O, L, S (and from guess 1: C, R, A, N, E).\n\nTherefore, the set of excluded letters is: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.\n\nAvailable letters: all others except these.\n\nWe know:\n- The word contains T and I. T is not in position 1, I is not in position 3.\n- Since T and I are present, and the word is 5 letters.\n\nAlso, note that in ""toils"", T was in position 1 and I in position 3, but those positions are wrong for these letters. So T must be in positions 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions 2, 4, or 5? The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nBut T cannot be in position 1 (as in the guess). Similarly, I cannot be in position 3.\n\nNow, T is present but not in position 1, and I is present but not in position 3.\n\nWe need to form a guess that:\n- Does not use any excluded letters: so avoid C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.\n- Must include T and I (since we know they are in the word, we should reuse them to find their positions).\n- And we should try to include new letters to gain more information.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have to include T and I in every guess? Actually, no, we can guess without them, but since we know they are in the word, it\'s efficient to place them in positions we haven\'t tested to narrow down.\n\nMoreover, we have 3 letters unknown: since T and I are already present, there are 3 other letters in the word to discover.\n\nNow, what positions are available for T? It can be in 2, 3, 4, or 5? But we don\'t know about position 2 yet. In the second guess, T was in position 1, so position 1 is wrong. But that doesn\'t tell us about other positions. So T must appear in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? And similarly, I must appear in position 1,2,4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong).\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But we haven\'t seen any indication, so we\'ll assume no duplicates for now.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: excluding C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S, we have:\nB, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we know I and T are in the word, so they can be reused? But we don\'t yet know about others.\n\nNow, we want to form a word that includes T and I, and three new letters to test.\n\nWe also know that T cannot be in position 1 (from the first letter of guess 2), and I cannot be in position 3.\n\nIn our new guess, we can try placing T in a different position to see if we get a ✓ or a -.\n\nSimilarly for I.\n\nA good strategy: place T in position 2 or 4? Since position 1 is excluded for T, and in the second guess we didn\'t test T in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, for I: avoid position 3, so try in position 1,2,4, or 5.\n\nBut we also need to pick three new letters.\n\nLet me think of common words that fit.\n\nWe can aim for a word that has T and I and three common letters: like D, H, M, P, etc.\n\nFor example, pick letters: D, H, M, along with T and I.\n\nThen form a word: possible words?\n- Must be 5 letters, and avoid C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S.\n\nPossible word: ""THUMB""? But U is available? ""THUMB"" has T,H,U,M,B. But we need to include I? Oh, I forgot we must include I.\n\nSo we need a word that has T, I, and three other new letters.\n\nLet me try: ""MIGHT"" -> M,I,G,H,T. However, that has I in position 2 and T in position 5.\n\nBut position 3? We put G there.\n\nAvailable letters: we haven\'t excluded B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n""might"" is M-I-G-H-T.\n\nBut note: we know I cannot be in position 3? Actually, in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but in our guess, we can put I anywhere? We are testing new positions.\n\nIn this guess, we can put I in position 2? That\'s allowed because we haven\'t tested I in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, T in position 5.\n\nBut we aren\'t sure what positions they are in.\n\nAnother word: ""PITHY"" -> P,I,T,H,Y. But that has I in position 2 and T in position 3? We want to avoid putting I in position 3? Actually, no, we are guessing — we can put I in position 3? The feedback will tell us if it\'s correct or not.\n\nHowever, we know from previous feedback that the secret word\'s I is not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will get an x for sure? Actually, no: because we already know I is not in position 3? So we\'d get a - if it were present but in wrong position, but we put it in the wrong position? It might be inefficient.\n\nBut note the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, we get ✓. Otherwise, if it\'s in the word but wrong position, we get -.\n\nWe know I is in the word, but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will never get ✓, only - or x? Actually, since we know it\'s not position 3, if we put it there, it should give us - (because it is in the word but wrong position). So we wouldn\'t learn much except that it\'s not there, which we already know.\n\nSimilarly for T: we know it\'s not in position 1.\n\nTo avoid redundant information, we should avoid putting T in position 1 and I in position 3.\n\nTherefore, in our new guess, place T in positions 2,3,4,5 but not 1. And I in positions 1,2,4,5 but not 3.\n\nLet me think of a word that meets these conditions.\n\nAlso, we want to use common letters not yet tested.\n\nSo: for example, T in position 2: then ? T ? ? ?\n\nOr T in position 4: then ? ? ? T ?\n\nSimilarly for I.\n\nOne idea: put I in position 1 and T in position 4? Or to maximize information, put them in positions that we haven\'t ruled out.\n\nTry: I in position 1, T in position 5, and then three new letters.\n\nSo: I _ _ _ T\n\nWhat words? Like ""INPUT"" but N and P? N is excluded (from guess 1: N is not in word).\n\nN is excluded, so not available.\n\n""QUIET"" but Q and U? Also, E is excluded.\n\nAvoid E.\n\n""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T. That works: F, I, G, H, T.\n- Positions: I in position 2? ""FIGHT"" is F-I-G-H-T, so I is in position 2, T in position 5.\n\nThat works.\n\nAlso, ""FIGHT"" uses F which is new, G, H, T, I.\n\nT is reused, I is reused.\n\nAlso, positions: I is in position 2 (we haven\'t tested I in position 2), T in position 5 (we haven\'t tested T in position 5).\n\nMoreover, we haven\'t tested F, G, H.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nAnother word: ""MIGHT"" as before: M,I,G,H,T. Same positions.\n\nBut ""FIGHT"" is valid.\n\nIs there a word with T in position 2? Like ""BOTHY"" but O is excluded and we need I? Doesn\'t work.\n\n""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> positions: P in 1, I in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5.\nBut we have T in position 3? We haven\'t tested T in position 3.\n\nAnd I in position 2? Also fine.\n\nBut note: we know I is present and T is present, so both are in the word.\n\nIn ""PITHY"", if we put T in position 3, that might be acceptable because we haven\'t tested that position for T.\n\nBut we must avoid I in position 3? Not necessary for the guess? We can put T in position 3? But we don\'t know if T is in position 3? It could be.\n\nBut note: in the feedback rule, if it is in the correct position, we get ✓.\n\nSo it\'s acceptable.\n\nHowever, comparing ""FIGHT"" and ""PITHY"", both cover similar letters.\n\nBut ""FIGHT"" tests F, which might be less common? Actually, H is common.\n\nAlso, in ""PITHY"", we have Y which is less common.\n\nSo ""FIGHT"" might be better.\n\nAnother word: ""WIGHT"" (a mythical being) - but rare? Avoid rare words? We want common words.\n\n""FIGHT"" is common.\n\nAlternatively, ""DIGHT""? Not common.\n\n""TIGHT"" - but T in position 1: but we cannot have T in position 1! Because we know T is not in the correct position if placed first? Actually, we already got - for T in position 1, meaning it\'s present but not in first position. But we can put T in the first position? We would get a - again? Because we already know it\'s not first position.\n\nBut that would be inefficient: if we put T in position 1, we know it will be - for sure.\n\nSimilarly, avoid that.\n\nSo ""TIGHT"" starts with T -> position 1: T, but we know T isn\'t in position 1, so it would be - or x? Present but wrong position -> so we\'d get -, which we already know. So wasteful.\n\nTherefore, avoid placing T in position 1 and I in position 3.\n\nBack to ""FIGHT"": letters F,I,G,H,T.\n\nPositions: \n1: F (new)\n2: I (we haven\'t tested position 2 for I)\n3: G (new)\n4: H (new)\n5: T (we haven\'t tested position 5 for T)\n\nThis tests I in position 2 and T in position 5, which were not tested before.\n\nWe might get hits.\n\nAnother possibility: ""PUPIL"" but U is not very common? and L is excluded. Wait, L is excluded? From guess 2: L(x) -> not in word.\n\nSo we cannot use L.\n\n""MUMMY"" has duplicate M? Not efficient.\n\n""DUVET"" has D,U,V,E,T? But E is excluded.\n\nSo ""FIGHT"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if the word ""FIGHT"" is allowed: yes, it\'s a standard English word.\n\nFinal guess: ""FIGHT"".\n\nHowever, note: from feedback we have T(-) meaning T is in the word but not in first position. We haven\'t tested T in position 5, so we do that.\n\nSimilarly for I: in guess 2, I was in position 3 and got -, meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 3. Now we try it in position 2.\n\nWe also test F, G, H.\n\nThis maximizes new information.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.From the feedback:\n- In Guess 1 (""crane""), all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are excluded.\n- In Guess 2 (""toils""), T is present but in the wrong position (-), O is absent (x), I is present but in the wrong position (-), L is absent (x), and S is absent (x). This means O, L, and S are excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.  \nConfirmed present letters: T and I, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.\n\nThe new guess must include T and I (to locate their correct positions) and avoid excluded letters. T cannot be placed in position 1, and I cannot be placed in position 3. To maximize information gain, I placed I in position 2 (untested) and T in position 5 (untested), while introducing three new common letters: F, G, H.\n\nThe word ""FIGHT"" meets these criteria:  \n- Positions: F (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5).  \n- Avoids excluded letters and reuses T and I in new positions.  \n- Tests F, G, and H for the first time.\n\n<guess>fight</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: fight -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: ""toils"" -> 
  T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, not at position 1)
  O: absent
  I: present but wrong position (so I is in the word, not at position 3)
  L: absent
  S: absent
Thus, O, L, S are also absent.

Guess 3: ""fight"" ->
  F: absent
  I: correct position (so I is in the word and at position 2)
  G: absent
  H: absent
  T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)

Now, we know:
- I is in the word and is in position 2. (from guess 3: I(✓) at position 2)
- T is in the word, but not at position 1 (from guess 2) and not at position 5 (from guess 3). So T must be in position 3 or 4? (since position 1 and 5 are ruled out, and position 2 is taken by I, so only 3 or 4 left for T? But wait, the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is I, so T cannot be there. So T must be in position 3 or 4.

But note: in guess 3, we had T at position 5 and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but not at 5. We also know from guess 2 that T is not at position 1. And position 2 is now taken by I, so T must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, we have the following letters absent: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S, F, G, H.

So the absent letters are: A, C, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S.

Now, the word must contain I at position 2 and T in either position 3 or 4, and two other letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have used 11 letters that are absent, so the remaining letters are: B, D, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that I and T are already in the word, so we are looking for the other three letters? Actually, the word has 5 letters: we have I at position 2, T at either 3 or 4, and then three other positions: 1, and then either 4 and 5 or 3 and 5? Let me clarify:

The positions:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- T must be in position 3 or 4.

Case 1: T in position 3.
Then the word is: _ I T _ _

Case 2: T in position 4.
Then the word is: _ I _ T _

We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set, excluding the absent ones.

Available letters: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (and T and I are already used, but we can use them again? But we assume no duplicates? Since we haven't seen any duplicates so far, and it's common in Wordle, we assume no duplicates. So each letter only once.)

Therefore, we cannot use T or I again. So the other letters must be from: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a valid English word.

Also, we have two cases for T's position.

We should make a guess that helps us distinguish between these cases and also tests new letters.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess.

We can try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters left: B, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We can try a word that has T in position 3 or 4? But we don't know which, so we might want to test one of the cases.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested? But we have tested T in position 1 and 5, and we know it's not there. We haven't tested position 3 or 4.

But in our guess, we can place T in position 3 to see if it's correct? Or in position 4.

But we don't know, so we can try one.

We can also try to include other common letters.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern.

First, if T is in position 3: pattern _ I T _ _

Possible words: with available letters: e.g., ""BITTY"" but T repeated? Not allowed? We assume no duplicates. Also, Y is available.

""BITTY"" has two T's, so invalid.

""MITTS"" but S is absent.

""PITTA"" but A is absent.

""KITTY"" again two T's.

""WITTY"" two T's.

Not many common words with _ I T _ _ without the absent letters.

What about ""DITZY""? D,I,T,Z,Y. Z and Y are available.

But ""DITZY"" is a word? Yes, meaning silly or scatterbrained.

But let's see the pattern: D I T Z Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:T, 4:Z, 5:Y.

But we don't know if T is in position 3.

Similarly, for the other case: _ I _ T _

Possible words: e.g., ""PITHY"" but H is absent and we have I in position 2? ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y, but T is in position 3, not 4. We need T in position 4.

So _ I _ T _ : e.g., ""DIXIT"" but X and I? ""DIXIT"" is D-I-X-I-T, has two I's? Not allowed.

""JIVED"" but E is absent.

""BIDET"" but E absent.

""MINTS"" S absent.

""PINTS"" S absent.

""VISTA"" S and A absent.

This is tricky.

Another idea: ""MINTY"" but N absent? N is absent.

""PUDGY"" but G absent? G is absent from guess 3.

G is absent.

Perhaps we should not fix T in the guess? But we know T is in the word, so we should use it to find the position.

But we have to avoid positions 1 and 5 for T.

So in our guess, we can put T in position 3 or 4.

Let me list possible words that fit one of the patterns and use available letters.

Available: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pattern 1: _ I T _ _ 

Examples:
- D I T C H -> but C and H absent.
- D I T Z Y -> ""DITZY"" as above.

Pattern 2: _ I _ T _

Examples:
- B I D T E -> E absent.
- M I D T ? 
- P I P T ? 
- W I T T Y -> two T's.

""JUMBO"" but no T? We need to include T.

We must include T because it's in the word.

Another word: ""QUIPT"" but Q and P, and T at the end? But T cannot be at position 5? We know T is not at 5, so if we put T at 5, we get a ""-"" again? But we want to test a new position.

So let's try to put T in position 3 or 4.

How about ""QUITE""? But E absent.

""QUIT"" is 4 letters.

""QUIET"" E absent.

""BUILT"" U,I,L,T but L is absent.

""GUILT"" G and L absent.

""JUICY"" C absent.

This is difficult.

Perhaps we can use a word that has T in position 3 and common letters.

""MITCH"" M,I,T,C,H -> C and H absent.

""BITMAP"" too long.

""PITON"" O absent.

""KITBAG"" A absent.

""WITAN"" A and N absent.

Maybe ""DITZY"" is acceptable.

But let's consider the other case: if we put T in position 4.

Word: _ I _ T _

For example, ""DIETY"" but E absent.

""PIETY"" E absent.

""BIZET"" Z, but E absent and T at the end? Position 5, but we know T is not at 5, so if we put T at 5, we get ""-"" which we already know, so it's wasteful.

In the pattern _ I _ T _, the T is at position 4, so that's fine.

But we need a word.

""JIVET"" J,I,V,E,T -> E absent.

""VIVID"" no T.

""MINIM"" no T.

""PIXIE"" E absent and I repeated.

""WIZUT"" not a word.

""YIETY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""DIZZY"" no T.

I think we need to consider that T might be in position 3, and use ""DITZY"".

Or ""MITZY"" not a word.

Another idea: ""PITKY"" not a word.

Perhaps we missed some letters. Available: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

What about ""MIXUP"" no T.

""QUIPU"" no T.

We must include T.

Let's try to form ""JUDY T"" not.

Perhaps ""DUVET"" but E and V? E absent.

I think we have to go with ""DITZY"" for the pattern with T in position 3.

But let's check if there are other words.

""BITTY"" invalid.

""WITTY"" invalid.

""KITTY"" invalid.

""MITTY"" not common.

""PITTY"" not common.

""TITTY"" not appropriate.

So ""DITZY"" might be the best shot.

But we also have the possibility that T is in position 4.

If we guess ""DITZY"", with T in position 3, then if the word has T in position 3, we might get a hit, else we get a - or x.

But if we get a hit for T, then we know it's position 3.

If we get a - for T, then T must be in position 4.

So it's informative.

Similarly, for the other letters.

So let's go with ""DITZY"".

But is ""DITZY"" a valid word? Yes, it is in some dictionaries.

To be safe, we can choose a more common word.

Another word: ""PITHY"" but H absent and T in position 3? But H is absent.

""WITHY"" W,I,T,H,Y -> H absent.

""KITHY"" not a word.

""ZITHER"" too long.

Perhaps ""DITTO"" but O absent and two T's.

O is absent.

""BIGHT"" G and H absent? In guess 3, G and H are absent.

G and H are absent.

In ""DITZY"", we have D, I, T, Z, Y. Z and Y are not common, but we have to use available letters.

Another common letter: U.

Word with U and T.

For example, ""QUIET"" not.

""BUILT"" L absent.

""DUSTY"" S absent.

""JUDGY"" G absent.

""FUDGY"" F and G absent.

I think ""DITZY"" is acceptable.

But let's see if we can find a word with T in position 4.

For example, ""DIVOT"" O and V? O absent.

""BIGOT"" G and O absent.

""PIVOT"" O absent.

""WIVED"" E absent.

""JIVED"" E absent.

""VIVID"" no T.

""YIVIS"" not a word.

So it's hard.

Perhaps ""MIXED"" E absent.

I think we should go with ""DITZY"".

But there's another word: ""DIZZY"" but no T.

Or ""JAZZY"" no T.

So ""DITZY"" it is.

But in ""DITZY"", we have:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: I (but we know I is correct at position 2, so it will be ✓)
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: Z
- Position 5: Y

We will get feedback on D, T, Z, Y.

If T is in position 3 in the secret word, we get T(✓), else if T is in position 4, we get T(-) because it's present but not at 3.

And we test D, Z, Y.

So it's informative.

We can also consider ""PZAZZ"" not a word.

So I think ""DITZY"" is the best we can do.

But let's confirm the feedback we expect.

Secret word has I at position 2, T at either 3 or 4, and three other letters from available set.

If we guess ""DITZY"":
- D: could be absent or present? We don't know.
- I: will be ✓ (position 2)
- T: if secret word has T at position 3, then ✓, else if at position 4, then - (because present but not at 3)
- Z: ?
- Y: ?

Then based on feedback, we can proceed.

Another word: ""JITTY"" not common, and T at position 3? J,I,T,T,Y two T's.

Invalid.

""BITTY"" invalid.

So I'll go with ""DITZY"".

But to be more common, what about ""MIXTY"" not a word.

Or ""VITZY"" not.

So ""DITZY"" is acceptable.

Perhaps ""DICKY"" but C and K? C is absent.

C is absent.

So no.

""DIKED"" E absent.

""DIKEY"" not common.

I think we have to use ""DITZY"".

But let's think of a different approach: maybe we don't put I in position 2? But we know I is fixed at position 2, so in our guess, we must have I at position 2 to avoid wasting a position? Because if we put I elsewhere, we know it will be - or x, but since it's fixed at 2, if we put it elsewhere, it will be - (because present but wrong position), which we already know, so it's better to keep it at position 2 to free up other positions for new letters.

In this case, for position 2, we must put I, because it's correct and we can get a ✓, which doesn't cost us information.

So position 2 must be I.

Then for T, we put it in a new position, say 3 or 4.

So ""DITZY"" is fine.

Another word: ""PITZA"" not a word.

""PIZZA"" has Z twice and A absent.

Not.

So I'll guess ""DITZY"".

But let's write it.

<guess>ditzy</guess>

But we have to make sure it's 5 letters.

D-I-T-Z-Y.

Yes.

Perhaps ""WIFTY"" not a word.

So I think that's it.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E.
   - **Guess 2 (""toils"")**: 
     - T is present but wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 1.
     - O, L, S are absent (x). Excluded letters: O, L, S.
     - I is present but wrong position (-), so I is in the word but not at position 3.
   - **Guess 3 (""fight"")**:
     - F, G, H are absent (x). Excluded letters: F, G, H.
     - I is correct position (✓), so I is in the word and fixed at position 2.
     - T is present but wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 5.
   
   **Summary**:
   - Excluded letters (15 total): A, C, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S (from guesses 1-3).
   - Confirmed letters: 
     - I is fixed at position 2 (from ""fight"" ✓).
     - T is present but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""toils"" - at pos 1 and ""fight"" - at pos 5). T must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Remaining letters available (not excluded and not yet used): B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Since I and T are confirmed, the word has 3 unknown letters from the remaining pool. No duplicates are assumed.

2. **Deduce Word Structure**:
   - Position 2 is fixed as I.
   - T must be in position 3 or 4 (positions 1 and 5 are ruled out for T).
   - Two possible patterns:
     - If T is in position 3: `_ I T _ _`
     - If T is in position 4: `_ I _ T _`
   - The unknown positions (1, 3/4, and 5) must be filled with letters from the available set (B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Prioritize testing T's position to resolve ambiguity (position 3 vs. 4) while introducing new high-frequency letters.
   - Place T in position 3 to test if it is correct (if not, T must be in position 4).
   - Fill other positions with common unused letters (e.g., D, Y, Z) to maximize information.
   - Avoid redundant placements (e.g., I is fixed at position 2, so no need to test elsewhere; T should not be placed in positions 1 or 5).

4. **Word Selection**:
   - Target pattern: `_ I T _ _` (to test T in position 3).
   - Possible words: ""DITZY"" fits the pattern and uses available letters (D, Z, Y are new and relatively common).
     - D in position 1 (new).
     - I in position 2 (fixed, will be ✓).
     - T in position 3 (testing for correctness).
     - Z in position 4 (new).
     - Y in position 5 (new).
   - ""DITZY"" is a valid English word (meaning silly or scatterbrained) and tests:
     - Whether T is in position 3 (✓ or -).
     - Presence of D, Z, Y (which could be in the word or absent).

5. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If T is in position 3: Feedback will show T(✓), confirming T's position.
   - If T is not in position 3: Feedback will show T(-), confirming T must be in position 4.
   - Feedback on D, Z, Y will reveal if any are present, narrowing possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>ditzy</guess>",ditzy,"We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: ""toils"" -> 
  T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, not at position 1)
  O: absent
  I: present but wrong position (so I is in the word, not at position 3)
  L: absent
  S: absent
Thus, O, L, S are also absent.

Guess 3: ""fight"" ->
  F: absent
  I: correct position (so I is in the word and at position 2)
  G: absent
  H: absent
  T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)

Now, we know:
- I is in the word and is in position 2. (from guess 3: I(✓) at position 2)
- T is in the word, but not at position 1 (from guess 2) and not at position 5 (from guess 3). So T must be in position 3 or 4? (since position 1 and 5 are ruled out, and position 2 is taken by I, so only 3 or 4 left for T? But wait, the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is I, so T cannot be there. So T must be in position 3 or 4.

But note: in guess 3, we had T at position 5 and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but not at 5. We also know from guess 2 that T is not at position 1. And position 2 is now taken by I, so T must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, we have the following letters absent: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S, F, G, H.

So the absent letters are: A, C, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S.

Now, the word must contain I at position 2 and T in either position 3 or 4, and two other letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have used 11 letters that are absent, so the remaining letters are: B, D, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that I and T are already in the word, so we are looking for the other three letters? Actually, the word has 5 letters: we have I at position 2, T at either 3 or 4, and then three other positions: 1, and then either 4 and 5 or 3 and 5? Let me clarify:

The positions:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- T must be in position 3 or 4.

Case 1: T in position 3.
Then the word is: _ I T _ _

Case 2: T in position 4.
Then the word is: _ I _ T _

We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set, excluding the absent ones.

Available letters: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (and T and I are already used, but we can use them again? But we assume no duplicates? Since we haven't seen any duplicates so far, and it's common in Wordle, we assume no duplicates. So each letter only once.)

Therefore, we cannot use T or I again. So the other letters must be from: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a valid English word.

Also, we have two cases for T's position.

We should make a guess that helps us distinguish between these cases and also tests new letters.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess.

We can try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters left: B, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We can try a word that has T in position 3 or 4? But we don't know which, so we might want to test one of the cases.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested? But we have tested T in position 1 and 5, and we know it's not there. We haven't tested position 3 or 4.

But in our guess, we can place T in position 3 to see if it's correct? Or in position 4.

But we don't know, so we can try one.

We can also try to include other common letters.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern.

First, if T is in position 3: pattern _ I T _ _

Possible words: with available letters: e.g., ""BITTY"" but T repeated? Not allowed? We assume no duplicates. Also, Y is available.

""BITTY"" has two T's, so invalid.

""MITTS"" but S is absent.

""PITTA"" but A is absent.

""KITTY"" again two T's.

""WITTY"" two T's.

Not many common words with _ I T _ _ without the absent letters.

What about ""DITZY""? D,I,T,Z,Y. Z and Y are available.

But ""DITZY"" is a word? Yes, meaning silly or scatterbrained.

But let's see the pattern: D I T Z Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:T, 4:Z, 5:Y.

But we don't know if T is in position 3.

Similarly, for the other case: _ I _ T _

Possible words: e.g., ""PITHY"" but H is absent and we have I in position 2? ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y, but T is in position 3, not 4. We need T in position 4.

So _ I _ T _ : e.g., ""DIXIT"" but X and I? ""DIXIT"" is D-I-X-I-T, has two I's? Not allowed.

""JIVED"" but E is absent.

""BIDET"" but E absent.

""MINTS"" S absent.

""PINTS"" S absent.

""VISTA"" S and A absent.

This is tricky.

Another idea: ""MINTY"" but N absent? N is absent.

""PUDGY"" but G absent? G is absent from guess 3.

G is absent.

Perhaps we should not fix T in the guess? But we know T is in the word, so we should use it to find the position.

But we have to avoid positions 1 and 5 for T.

So in our guess, we can put T in position 3 or 4.

Let me list possible words that fit one of the patterns and use available letters.

Available: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pattern 1: _ I T _ _ 

Examples:
- D I T C H -> but C and H absent.
- D I T Z Y -> ""DITZY"" as above.

Pattern 2: _ I _ T _

Examples:
- B I D T E -> E absent.
- M I D T ? 
- P I P T ? 
- W I T T Y -> two T's.

""JUMBO"" but no T? We need to include T.

We must include T because it's in the word.

Another word: ""QUIPT"" but Q and P, and T at the end? But T cannot be at position 5? We know T is not at 5, so if we put T at 5, we get a ""-"" again? But we want to test a new position.

So let's try to put T in position 3 or 4.

How about ""QUITE""? But E absent.

""QUIT"" is 4 letters.

""QUIET"" E absent.

""BUILT"" U,I,L,T but L is absent.

""GUILT"" G and L absent.

""JUICY"" C absent.

This is difficult.

Perhaps we can use a word that has T in position 3 and common letters.

""MITCH"" M,I,T,C,H -> C and H absent.

""BITMAP"" too long.

""PITON"" O absent.

""KITBAG"" A absent.

""WITAN"" A and N absent.

Maybe ""DITZY"" is acceptable.

But let's consider the other case: if we put T in position 4.

Word: _ I _ T _

For example, ""DIETY"" but E absent.

""PIETY"" E absent.

""BIZET"" Z, but E absent and T at the end? Position 5, but we know T is not at 5, so if we put T at 5, we get ""-"" which we already know, so it's wasteful.

In the pattern _ I _ T _, the T is at position 4, so that's fine.

But we need a word.

""JIVET"" J,I,V,E,T -> E absent.

""VIVID"" no T.

""MINIM"" no T.

""PIXIE"" E absent and I repeated.

""WIZUT"" not a word.

""YIETY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""DIZZY"" no T.

I think we need to consider that T might be in position 3, and use ""DITZY"".

Or ""MITZY"" not a word.

Another idea: ""PITKY"" not a word.

Perhaps we missed some letters. Available: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

What about ""MIXUP"" no T.

""QUIPU"" no T.

We must include T.

Let's try to form ""JUDY T"" not.

Perhaps ""DUVET"" but E and V? E absent.

I think we have to go with ""DITZY"" for the pattern with T in position 3.

But let's check if there are other words.

""BITTY"" invalid.

""WITTY"" invalid.

""KITTY"" invalid.

""MITTY"" not common.

""PITTY"" not common.

""TITTY"" not appropriate.

So ""DITZY"" might be the best shot.

But we also have the possibility that T is in position 4.

If we guess ""DITZY"", with T in position 3, then if the word has T in position 3, we might get a hit, else we get a - or x.

But if we get a hit for T, then we know it's position 3.

If we get a - for T, then T must be in position 4.

So it's informative.

Similarly, for the other letters.

So let's go with ""DITZY"".

But is ""DITZY"" a valid word? Yes, it is in some dictionaries.

To be safe, we can choose a more common word.

Another word: ""PITHY"" but H absent and T in position 3? But H is absent.

""WITHY"" W,I,T,H,Y -> H absent.

""KITHY"" not a word.

""ZITHER"" too long.

Perhaps ""DITTO"" but O absent and two T's.

O is absent.

""BIGHT"" G and H absent? In guess 3, G and H are absent.

G and H are absent.

In ""DITZY"", we have D, I, T, Z, Y. Z and Y are not common, but we have to use available letters.

Another common letter: U.

Word with U and T.

For example, ""QUIET"" not.

""BUILT"" L absent.

""DUSTY"" S absent.

""JUDGY"" G absent.

""FUDGY"" F and G absent.

I think ""DITZY"" is acceptable.

But let's see if we can find a word with T in position 4.

For example, ""DIVOT"" O and V? O absent.

""BIGOT"" G and O absent.

""PIVOT"" O absent.

""WIVED"" E absent.

""JIVED"" E absent.

""VIVID"" no T.

""YIVIS"" not a word.

So it's hard.

Perhaps ""MIXED"" E absent.

I think we should go with ""DITZY"".

But there's another word: ""DIZZY"" but no T.

Or ""JAZZY"" no T.

So ""DITZY"" it is.

But in ""DITZY"", we have:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: I (but we know I is correct at position 2, so it will be ✓)
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: Z
- Position 5: Y

We will get feedback on D, T, Z, Y.

If T is in position 3 in the secret word, we get T(✓), else if T is in position 4, we get T(-) because it's present but not at 3.

And we test D, Z, Y.

So it's informative.

We can also consider ""PZAZZ"" not a word.

So I think ""DITZY"" is the best we can do.

But let's confirm the feedback we expect.

Secret word has I at position 2, T at either 3 or 4, and three other letters from available set.

If we guess ""DITZY"":
- D: could be absent or present? We don't know.
- I: will be ✓ (position 2)
- T: if secret word has T at position 3, then ✓, else if at position 4, then - (because present but not at 3)
- Z: ?
- Y: ?

Then based on feedback, we can proceed.

Another word: ""JITTY"" not common, and T at position 3? J,I,T,T,Y two T's.

Invalid.

""BITTY"" invalid.

So I'll go with ""DITZY"".

But to be more common, what about ""MIXTY"" not a word.

Or ""VITZY"" not.

So ""DITZY"" is acceptable.

Perhaps ""DICKY"" but C and K? C is absent.

C is absent.

So no.

""DIKED"" E absent.

""DIKEY"" not common.

I think we have to use ""DITZY"".

But let's think of a different approach: maybe we don't put I in position 2? But we know I is fixed at position 2, so in our guess, we must have I at position 2 to avoid wasting a position? Because if we put I elsewhere, we know it will be - or x, but since it's fixed at 2, if we put it elsewhere, it will be - (because present but wrong position), which we already know, so it's better to keep it at position 2 to free up other positions for new letters.

In this case, for position 2, we must put I, because it's correct and we can get a ✓, which doesn't cost us information.

So position 2 must be I.

Then for T, we put it in a new position, say 3 or 4.

So ""DITZY"" is fine.

Another word: ""PITZA"" not a word.

""PIZZA"" has Z twice and A absent.

Not.

So I'll guess ""DITZY"".

But let's write it.

<guess>ditzy</guess>

But we have to make sure it's 5 letters.

D-I-T-Z-Y.

Yes.

Perhaps ""WIFTY"" not a word.

So I think that's it.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:

   - **Guess 3 (""fight"")**:
     - F, G, H are absent (x). Excluded letters: F, G, H.
     - I is correct position (✓), so I is in the word and fixed at position 2.
     - T is present but wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 5.
   
   **Summary**:
   - Excluded letters (15 total): A, C, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S (from guesses 1-3).
   - Confirmed letters: 
     - I is fixed at position 2 (from ""fight"" ✓).
     - T is present but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""toils"" - at pos 1 and ""fight"" - at pos 5). T must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Remaining letters available (not excluded and not yet used): B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,BITTY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are just starting the game. We haven't any feedback yet, so we need to make a strategic first guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally 5 distinct letters to maximize information.

 Common starting words in word games include: CRANE, SLATE, ROAST, etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has common letters: C, R, A, N, E
 - All letters are distinct.

 So, I will guess ""CRANE"".I am starting the game with no prior feedback. For an initial guess, selecting a word with common letters maximizes information gain. ""CRANE"" is an optimal choice because it contains five distinct letters including frequent ones (A, E, R) and less common consonants (C, N). This spread helps efficiently reveal positional accuracy for the secret word.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""crane"" and all letters were marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to pick a word with 5 new letters. We should aim for common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C,R,A,N,E) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 A good starting point might be to use a word with high-frequency letters that we haven't tried.

 Let's consider words like: ""SLIMY"", ""TOUGH"", ""PUDGY"", etc. But we want to maximize coverage of new letters.

 Another popular second guess after eliminating 5 letters is to use another set of common letters.

 Let me think of a word that uses common letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}. For example:

 S, T, L, O, P, I, D, M, H, B, etc.

 I can try ""SPLIT"" but that has I and T which are common. However, let's check if we can get more coverage.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has M, O, I, S, T — all common letters and none of the excluded ones.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

 Since we have no information, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me choose ""MOIST"":

 M, O, I, S, T — all new.

 However, if we are avoiding the letters from the first guess, then yes.

 Another option: ""PUDGY"" — P, U, D, G, Y — but Y is less common.

 Or ""LUCKY"" — but we know C is already out? Yes, C is out.

 Actually, we must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, ""MOIST"" is valid.

 But let's consider frequency. According to English letter frequency, after removing C,R,A,N,E, the next most common are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, H, etc.

 We can try to cover S, T, L, O, I.

 The word ""TOILS"" or ""SOILT"" — but ""SOILT"" is not a word. ""SLOTH"" is a word: S, L, O, T, H — that covers 5 new letters including H.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T.

 But I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T — which are all high frequency.

 However, note that we are in the second guess and we have 5 new letters. We want to maximize the chance of getting hits.

 Let me check: the most common letters in 5-letter words (without C,R,A,N,E) are:

 According to various sources, the top letters are: E, A, R, O, T, I, S, N, etc. but we have excluded E,A,R,N. So the next are O, T, I, S, L, C (but C is out), so O, T, I, S, L.

 So a word with O, T, I, S, L would be ideal. But we can't have all in one word? Let's see:

 Words: ""TOILS"" (T, O, I, L, S) — that's 5 letters. Is ""TOILS"" a valid word? Yes, it is (plural of toil? or third person present of toil? but in word games, it's accepted).

 Alternatively, ""SLOTH"" (S, L, O, T, H) — H is less common.

 Or ""POINT"" — but P is not as common as S or T? and we have O, I, N (but N is excluded) — wait, N is excluded, so we cannot use N.

 So ""POINT"" has N which is excluded.

 Therefore, ""TOILS"" is a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S.

 But let me confirm: T, O, I, L, S — none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}. So it's valid.

 Another option: ""BUOYS"" — B, U, O, Y, S — but Y and U are less common.

 I think ""TOILS"" is a strong choice.

 However, note that we are only on the second guess and we have 4 more after this. We can also consider words that have more vowels? We have O and I (vowels) in ""TOILS"", and we already tried A and E and they are not in the word, so the vowels left are O, I, U. We have O and I in ""TOILS"".

 Alternatively, we could use ""OUPHS"" — but that's obscure.

 I think ""TOILS"" is acceptable.

 But let me see if there's a word that includes U as well? We have to cover 5 letters, so we can't cover everything.

 We can stick with ""TOILS"".

 However, to be safe, I'll choose ""MOIST"" because it's a common word and we get M as well, which is a common consonant.

 But note: M is less common than L? Actually, L is the 12th most common letter in English, M is 14th, so L is slightly more common. But in ""TOILS"" we have L and in ""MOIST"" we have M.

 Since we have no information, either is fine.

 I'll go with ""TOILS"" because it uses the top letters we have available: S, T, L, O, I.

 So, my second guess is ""TOILS"".After the first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters (C, R, A, N, E) being marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. The new guess must avoid these letters and prioritize high-frequency English letters not yet tested. Common remaining letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, and H. 

The word ""TOILS"" is chosen because:
- It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters: T, O, I, L, S.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.
- It covers common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S), increasing the chance of hits.

This guess will help identify which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

<guess>toils</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect: so the secret word contains none of C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""toils"" -> T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)

From guess 2:
- T is in the word but not in the correct position (first position).
- O is not in the word.
- I is in the word but not in the correct position (third position).
- L is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.

So, letters that are in the secret word: T and I (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively).
Letters not in the word: O, L, S (and from guess 1: C, R, A, N, E).

Therefore, the set of excluded letters is: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.

Available letters: all others except these.

We know:
- The word contains T and I. T is not in position 1, I is not in position 3.
- Since T and I are present, and the word is 5 letters.

Also, note that in ""toils"", T was in position 1 and I in position 3, but those positions are wrong for these letters. So T must be in positions 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions 2, 4, or 5? The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

But T cannot be in position 1 (as in the guess). Similarly, I cannot be in position 3.

Now, T is present but not in position 1, and I is present but not in position 3.

We need to form a guess that:
- Does not use any excluded letters: so avoid C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.
- Must include T and I (since we know they are in the word, we should reuse them to find their positions).
- And we should try to include new letters to gain more information.

But note: we don't have to include T and I in every guess? Actually, no, we can guess without them, but since we know they are in the word, it's efficient to place them in positions we haven't tested to narrow down.

Moreover, we have 3 letters unknown: since T and I are already present, there are 3 other letters in the word to discover.

Now, what positions are available for T? It can be in 2, 3, 4, or 5? But we don't know about position 2 yet. In the second guess, T was in position 1, so position 1 is wrong. But that doesn't tell us about other positions. So T must appear in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? And similarly, I must appear in position 1,2,4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong).

But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any indication, so we'll assume no duplicates for now.

Let's list the available letters: excluding C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S, we have:
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know I and T are in the word, so they can be reused? But we don't yet know about others.

Now, we want to form a word that includes T and I, and three new letters to test.

We also know that T cannot be in position 1 (from the first letter of guess 2), and I cannot be in position 3.

In our new guess, we can try placing T in a different position to see if we get a ✓ or a -.

Similarly for I.

A good strategy: place T in position 2 or 4? Since position 1 is excluded for T, and in the second guess we didn't test T in position 2.

Similarly, for I: avoid position 3, so try in position 1,2,4, or 5.

But we also need to pick three new letters.

Let me think of common words that fit.

We can aim for a word that has T and I and three common letters: like D, H, M, P, etc.

For example, pick letters: D, H, M, along with T and I.

Then form a word: possible words?
- Must be 5 letters, and avoid C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S.

Possible word: ""THUMB""? But U is available? ""THUMB"" has T,H,U,M,B. But we need to include I? Oh, I forgot we must include I.

So we need a word that has T, I, and three other new letters.

Let me try: ""MIGHT"" -> M,I,G,H,T. However, that has I in position 2 and T in position 5.

But position 3? We put G there.

Available letters: we haven't excluded B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

""might"" is M-I-G-H-T.

But note: we know I cannot be in position 3? Actually, in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but in our guess, we can put I anywhere? We are testing new positions.

In this guess, we can put I in position 2? That's allowed because we haven't tested I in position 2.

Similarly, T in position 5.

But we aren't sure what positions they are in.

Another word: ""PITHY"" -> P,I,T,H,Y. But that has I in position 2 and T in position 3? We want to avoid putting I in position 3? Actually, no, we are guessing — we can put I in position 3? The feedback will tell us if it's correct or not.

However, we know from previous feedback that the secret word's I is not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will get an x for sure? Actually, no: because we already know I is not in position 3? So we'd get a - if it were present but in wrong position, but we put it in the wrong position? It might be inefficient.

But note the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, we get ✓. Otherwise, if it's in the word but wrong position, we get -.

We know I is in the word, but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will never get ✓, only - or x? Actually, since we know it's not position 3, if we put it there, it should give us - (because it is in the word but wrong position). So we wouldn't learn much except that it's not there, which we already know.

Similarly for T: we know it's not in position 1.

To avoid redundant information, we should avoid putting T in position 1 and I in position 3.

Therefore, in our new guess, place T in positions 2,3,4,5 but not 1. And I in positions 1,2,4,5 but not 3.

Let me think of a word that meets these conditions.

Also, we want to use common letters not yet tested.

So: for example, T in position 2: then ? T ? ? ?

Or T in position 4: then ? ? ? T ?

Similarly for I.

One idea: put I in position 1 and T in position 4? Or to maximize information, put them in positions that we haven't ruled out.

Try: I in position 1, T in position 5, and then three new letters.

So: I _ _ _ T

What words? Like ""INPUT"" but N and P? N is excluded (from guess 1: N is not in word).

N is excluded, so not available.

""QUIET"" but Q and U? Also, E is excluded.

Avoid E.

""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T. That works: F, I, G, H, T.
- Positions: I in position 2? ""FIGHT"" is F-I-G-H-T, so I is in position 2, T in position 5.

That works.

Also, ""FIGHT"" uses F which is new, G, H, T, I.

T is reused, I is reused.

Also, positions: I is in position 2 (we haven't tested I in position 2), T in position 5 (we haven't tested T in position 5).

Moreover, we haven't tested F, G, H.

So this seems good.

Another word: ""MIGHT"" as before: M,I,G,H,T. Same positions.

But ""FIGHT"" is valid.

Is there a word with T in position 2? Like ""BOTHY"" but O is excluded and we need I? Doesn't work.

""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> positions: P in 1, I in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5.
But we have T in position 3? We haven't tested T in position 3.

And I in position 2? Also fine.

But note: we know I is present and T is present, so both are in the word.

In ""PITHY"", if we put T in position 3, that might be acceptable because we haven't tested that position for T.

But we must avoid I in position 3? Not necessary for the guess? We can put T in position 3? But we don't know if T is in position 3? It could be.

But note: in the feedback rule, if it is in the correct position, we get ✓.

So it's acceptable.

However, comparing ""FIGHT"" and ""PITHY"", both cover similar letters.

But ""FIGHT"" tests F, which might be less common? Actually, H is common.

Also, in ""PITHY"", we have Y which is less common.

So ""FIGHT"" might be better.

Another word: ""WIGHT"" (a mythical being) - but rare? Avoid rare words? We want common words.

""FIGHT"" is common.

Alternatively, ""DIGHT""? Not common.

""TIGHT"" - but T in position 1: but we cannot have T in position 1! Because we know T is not in the correct position if placed first? Actually, we already got - for T in position 1, meaning it's present but not in first position. But we can put T in the first position? We would get a - again? Because we already know it's not first position.

But that would be inefficient: if we put T in position 1, we know it will be - for sure.

Similarly, avoid that.

So ""TIGHT"" starts with T -> position 1: T, but we know T isn't in position 1, so it would be - or x? Present but wrong position -> so we'd get -, which we already know. So wasteful.

Therefore, avoid placing T in position 1 and I in position 3.

Back to ""FIGHT"": letters F,I,G,H,T.

Positions: 
1: F (new)
2: I (we haven't tested position 2 for I)
3: G (new)
4: H (new)
5: T (we haven't tested position 5 for T)

This tests I in position 2 and T in position 5, which were not tested before.

We might get hits.

Another possibility: ""PUPIL"" but U is not very common? and L is excluded. Wait, L is excluded? From guess 2: L(x) -> not in word.

So we cannot use L.

""MUMMY"" has duplicate M? Not efficient.

""DUVET"" has D,U,V,E,T? But E is excluded.

So ""FIGHT"" seems good.

But let me check if the word ""FIGHT"" is allowed: yes, it's a standard English word.

Final guess: ""FIGHT"".

However, note: from feedback we have T(-) meaning T is in the word but not in first position. We haven't tested T in position 5, so we do that.

Similarly for I: in guess 2, I was in position 3 and got -, meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. Now we try it in position 2.

We also test F, G, H.

This maximizes new information.

So let's go with that.From the feedback:
- In Guess 1 (""crane""), all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are excluded.
- In Guess 2 (""toils""), T is present but in the wrong position (-), O is absent (x), I is present but in the wrong position (-), L is absent (x), and S is absent (x). This means O, L, and S are excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.  
Confirmed present letters: T and I, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.

The new guess must include T and I (to locate their correct positions) and avoid excluded letters. T cannot be placed in position 1, and I cannot be placed in position 3. To maximize information gain, I placed I in position 2 (untested) and T in position 5 (untested), while introducing three new common letters: F, G, H.

The word ""FIGHT"" meets these criteria:  
- Positions: F (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5).  
- Avoids excluded letters and reuses T and I in new positions.  
- Tests F, G, and H for the first time.

<guess>fight</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)
Guess 3: fight -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: ""toils"" -> 
  T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, not at position 1)
  O: absent
  I: present but wrong position (so I is in the word, not at position 3)
  L: absent
  S: absent
Thus, O, L, S are also absent.

Guess 3: ""fight"" ->
  F: absent
  I: correct position (so I is in the word and at position 2)
  G: absent
  H: absent
  T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)

Now, we know:
- I is in the word and is in position 2. (from guess 3: I(✓) at position 2)
- T is in the word, but not at position 1 (from guess 2) and not at position 5 (from guess 3). So T must be in position 3 or 4? (since position 1 and 5 are ruled out, and position 2 is taken by I, so only 3 or 4 left for T? But wait, the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is I, so T cannot be there. So T must be in position 3 or 4.

But note: in guess 3, we had T at position 5 and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but not at 5. We also know from guess 2 that T is not at position 1. And position 2 is now taken by I, so T must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, we have the following letters absent: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S, F, G, H.

So the absent letters are: A, C, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S.

Now, the word must contain I at position 2 and T in either position 3 or 4, and two other letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have used 11 letters that are absent, so the remaining letters are: B, D, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that I and T are already in the word, so we are looking for the other three letters? Actually, the word has 5 letters: we have I at position 2, T at either 3 or 4, and then three other positions: 1, and then either 4 and 5 or 3 and 5? Let me clarify:

The positions:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- T must be in position 3 or 4.

Case 1: T in position 3.
Then the word is: _ I T _ _

Case 2: T in position 4.
Then the word is: _ I _ T _

We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set, excluding the absent ones.

Available letters: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (and T and I are already used, but we can use them again? But we assume no duplicates? Since we haven't seen any duplicates so far, and it's common in Wordle, we assume no duplicates. So each letter only once.)

Therefore, we cannot use T or I again. So the other letters must be from: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a valid English word.

Also, we have two cases for T's position.

We should make a guess that helps us distinguish between these cases and also tests new letters.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess.

We can try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters left: B, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We can try a word that has T in position 3 or 4? But we don't know which, so we might want to test one of the cases.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested? But we have tested T in position 1 and 5, and we know it's not there. We haven't tested position 3 or 4.

But in our guess, we can place T in position 3 to see if it's correct? Or in position 4.

But we don't know, so we can try one.

We can also try to include other common letters.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern.

First, if T is in position 3: pattern _ I T _ _

Possible words: with available letters: e.g., ""BITTY"" but T repeated? Not allowed? We assume no duplicates. Also, Y is available.

""BITTY"" has two T's, so invalid.

""MITTS"" but S is absent.

""PITTA"" but A is absent.

""KITTY"" again two T's.

""WITTY"" two T's.

Not many common words with _ I T _ _ without the absent letters.

What about ""DITZY""? D,I,T,Z,Y. Z and Y are available.

But ""DITZY"" is a word? Yes, meaning silly or scatterbrained.

But let's see the pattern: D I T Z Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:T, 4:Z, 5:Y.

But we don't know if T is in position 3.

Similarly, for the other case: _ I _ T _

Possible words: e.g., ""PITHY"" but H is absent and we have I in position 2? ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y, but T is in position 3, not 4. We need T in position 4.

So _ I _ T _ : e.g., ""DIXIT"" but X and I? ""DIXIT"" is D-I-X-I-T, has two I's? Not allowed.

""JIVED"" but E is absent.

""BIDET"" but E absent.

""MINTS"" S absent.

""PINTS"" S absent.

""VISTA"" S and A absent.

This is tricky.

Another idea: ""MINTY"" but N absent? N is absent.

""PUDGY"" but G absent? G is absent from guess 3.

G is absent.

Perhaps we should not fix T in the guess? But we know T is in the word, so we should use it to find the position.

But we have to avoid positions 1 and 5 for T.

So in our guess, we can put T in position 3 or 4.

Let me list possible words that fit one of the patterns and use available letters.

Available: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pattern 1: _ I T _ _ 

Examples:
- D I T C H -> but C and H absent.
- D I T Z Y -> ""DITZY"" as above.

Pattern 2: _ I _ T _

Examples:
- B I D T E -> E absent.
- M I D T ? 
- P I P T ? 
- W I T T Y -> two T's.

""JUMBO"" but no T? We need to include T.

We must include T because it's in the word.

Another word: ""QUIPT"" but Q and P, and T at the end? But T cannot be at position 5? We know T is not at 5, so if we put T at 5, we get a ""-"" again? But we want to test a new position.

So let's try to put T in position 3 or 4.

How about ""QUITE""? But E absent.

""QUIT"" is 4 letters.

""QUIET"" E absent.

""BUILT"" U,I,L,T but L is absent.

""GUILT"" G and L absent.

""JUICY"" C absent.

This is difficult.

Perhaps we can use a word that has T in position 3 and common letters.

""MITCH"" M,I,T,C,H -> C and H absent.

""BITMAP"" too long.

""PITON"" O absent.

""KITBAG"" A absent.

""WITAN"" A and N absent.

Maybe ""DITZY"" is acceptable.

But let's consider the other case: if we put T in position 4.

Word: _ I _ T _

For example, ""DIETY"" but E absent.

""PIETY"" E absent.

""BIZET"" Z, but E absent and T at the end? Position 5, but we know T is not at 5, so if we put T at 5, we get ""-"" which we already know, so it's wasteful.

In the pattern _ I _ T _, the T is at position 4, so that's fine.

But we need a word.

""JIVET"" J,I,V,E,T -> E absent.

""VIVID"" no T.

""MINIM"" no T.

""PIXIE"" E absent and I repeated.

""WIZUT"" not a word.

""YIETY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""DIZZY"" no T.

I think we need to consider that T might be in position 3, and use ""DITZY"".

Or ""MITZY"" not a word.

Another idea: ""PITKY"" not a word.

Perhaps we missed some letters. Available: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

What about ""MIXUP"" no T.

""QUIPU"" no T.

We must include T.

Let's try to form ""JUDY T"" not.

Perhaps ""DUVET"" but E and V? E absent.

I think we have to go with ""DITZY"" for the pattern with T in position 3.

But let's check if there are other words.

""BITTY"" invalid.

""WITTY"" invalid.

""KITTY"" invalid.

""MITTY"" not common.

""PITTY"" not common.

""TITTY"" not appropriate.

So ""DITZY"" might be the best shot.

But we also have the possibility that T is in position 4.

If we guess ""DITZY"", with T in position 3, then if the word has T in position 3, we might get a hit, else we get a - or x.

But if we get a hit for T, then we know it's position 3.

If we get a - for T, then T must be in position 4.

So it's informative.

Similarly, for the other letters.

So let's go with ""DITZY"".

But is ""DITZY"" a valid word? Yes, it is in some dictionaries.

To be safe, we can choose a more common word.

Another word: ""PITHY"" but H absent and T in position 3? But H is absent.

""WITHY"" W,I,T,H,Y -> H absent.

""KITHY"" not a word.

""ZITHER"" too long.

Perhaps ""DITTO"" but O absent and two T's.

O is absent.

""BIGHT"" G and H absent? In guess 3, G and H are absent.

G and H are absent.

In ""DITZY"", we have D, I, T, Z, Y. Z and Y are not common, but we have to use available letters.

Another common letter: U.

Word with U and T.

For example, ""QUIET"" not.

""BUILT"" L absent.

""DUSTY"" S absent.

""JUDGY"" G absent.

""FUDGY"" F and G absent.

I think ""DITZY"" is acceptable.

But let's see if we can find a word with T in position 4.

For example, ""DIVOT"" O and V? O absent.

""BIGOT"" G and O absent.

""PIVOT"" O absent.

""WIVED"" E absent.

""JIVED"" E absent.

""VIVID"" no T.

""YIVIS"" not a word.

So it's hard.

Perhaps ""MIXED"" E absent.

I think we should go with ""DITZY"".

But there's another word: ""DIZZY"" but no T.

Or ""JAZZY"" no T.

So ""DITZY"" it is.

But in ""DITZY"", we have:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: I (but we know I is correct at position 2, so it will be ✓)
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: Z
- Position 5: Y

We will get feedback on D, T, Z, Y.

If T is in position 3 in the secret word, we get T(✓), else if T is in position 4, we get T(-) because it's present but not at 3.

And we test D, Z, Y.

So it's informative.

We can also consider ""PZAZZ"" not a word.

So I think ""DITZY"" is the best we can do.

But let's confirm the feedback we expect.

Secret word has I at position 2, T at either 3 or 4, and three other letters from available set.

If we guess ""DITZY"":
- D: could be absent or present? We don't know.
- I: will be ✓ (position 2)
- T: if secret word has T at position 3, then ✓, else if at position 4, then - (because present but not at 3)
- Z: ?
- Y: ?

Then based on feedback, we can proceed.

Another word: ""JITTY"" not common, and T at position 3? J,I,T,T,Y two T's.

Invalid.

""BITTY"" invalid.

So I'll go with ""DITZY"".

But to be more common, what about ""MIXTY"" not a word.

Or ""VITZY"" not.

So ""DITZY"" is acceptable.

Perhaps ""DICKY"" but C and K? C is absent.

C is absent.

So no.

""DIKED"" E absent.

""DIKEY"" not common.

I think we have to use ""DITZY"".

But let's think of a different approach: maybe we don't put I in position 2? But we know I is fixed at position 2, so in our guess, we must have I at position 2 to avoid wasting a position? Because if we put I elsewhere, we know it will be - or x, but since it's fixed at 2, if we put it elsewhere, it will be - (because present but wrong position), which we already know, so it's better to keep it at position 2 to free up other positions for new letters.

In this case, for position 2, we must put I, because it's correct and we can get a ✓, which doesn't cost us information.

So position 2 must be I.

Then for T, we put it in a new position, say 3 or 4.

So ""DITZY"" is fine.

Another word: ""PITZA"" not a word.

""PIZZA"" has Z twice and A absent.

Not.

So I'll guess ""DITZY"".

But let's write it.

<guess>ditzy</guess>

But we have to make sure it's 5 letters.

D-I-T-Z-Y.

Yes.

Perhaps ""WIFTY"" not a word.

So I think that's it.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E.
   - **Guess 2 (""toils"")**: 
     - T is present but wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 1.
     - O, L, S are absent (x). Excluded letters: O, L, S.
     - I is present but wrong position (-), so I is in the word but not at position 3.
   - **Guess 3 (""fight"")**:
     - F, G, H are absent (x). Excluded letters: F, G, H.
     - I is correct position (✓), so I is in the word and fixed at position 2.
     - T is present but wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 5.
   
   **Summary**:
   - Excluded letters (15 total): A, C, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S (from guesses 1-3).
   - Confirmed letters: 
     - I is fixed at position 2 (from ""fight"" ✓).
     - T is present but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""toils"" - at pos 1 and ""fight"" - at pos 5). T must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Remaining letters available (not excluded and not yet used): B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Since I and T are confirmed, the word has 3 unknown letters from the remaining pool. No duplicates are assumed.

2. **Deduce Word Structure**:
   - Position 2 is fixed as I.
   - T must be in position 3 or 4 (positions 1 and 5 are ruled out for T).
   - Two possible patterns:
     - If T is in position 3: `_ I T _ _`
     - If T is in position 4: `_ I _ T _`
   - The unknown positions (1, 3/4, and 5) must be filled with letters from the available set (B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Prioritize testing T's position to resolve ambiguity (position 3 vs. 4) while introducing new high-frequency letters.
   - Place T in position 3 to test if it is correct (if not, T must be in position 4).
   - Fill other positions with common unused letters (e.g., D, Y, Z) to maximize information.
   - Avoid redundant placements (e.g., I is fixed at position 2, so no need to test elsewhere; T should not be placed in positions 1 or 5).

4. **Word Selection**:
   - Target pattern: `_ I T _ _` (to test T in position 3).
   - Possible words: ""DITZY"" fits the pattern and uses available letters (D, Z, Y are new and relatively common).
     - D in position 1 (new).
     - I in position 2 (fixed, will be ✓).
     - T in position 3 (testing for correctness).
     - Z in position 4 (new).
     - Y in position 5 (new).
   - ""DITZY"" is a valid English word (meaning silly or scatterbrained) and tests:
     - Whether T is in position 3 (✓ or -).
     - Presence of D, Z, Y (which could be in the word or absent).

5. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If T is in position 3: Feedback will show T(✓), confirming T's position.
   - If T is not in position 3: Feedback will show T(-), confirming T must be in position 4.
   - Feedback on D, Z, Y will reveal if any are present, narrowing possibilities for the next guess.

For an initial guess, selecting a word with common letters maximizes information gain.

The first guess was ""crane"" and all letters were marked as \'x\', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a word that does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n We need to pick a word with 5 new letters. We should aim for common letters that haven\'t been tried yet.\n\n Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C,R,A,N,E) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, etc.\n\n A good starting point might be to use a word with high-frequency letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let\'s consider words like: ""SLIMY"", ""TOUGH"", ""PUDGY"", etc. But we want to maximize coverage of new letters.\n\n Another popular second guess after eliminating 5 letters is to use another set of common letters.\n\n Let me think of a word that uses common letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}. For example:\n\n S, T, L, O, P, I, D, M, H, B, etc.\n\n I can try ""SPLIT"" but that has I and T which are common. However, let\'s check if we can get more coverage.\n\n Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has M, O, I, S, T — all common letters and none of the excluded ones.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.\n\n Since we have no information, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me choose ""MOIST"":\n\n M, O, I, S, T — all new.\n\n However, if we are avoiding the letters from the first guess, then yes.\n\n Another option: ""PUDGY"" — P, U, D, G, Y — but Y is less common.\n\n Or ""LUCKY"" — but we know C is already out? Yes, C is out.\n\n Actually, we must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So, ""MOIST"" is valid.\n\n But let\'s consider frequency. According to English letter frequency, after removing C,R,A,N,E, the next most common are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, H, etc.\n\n We can try to cover S, T, L, O, I.\n\n The word ""TOILS"" or ""SOILT"" — but ""SOILT"" is not a word. ""SLOTH"" is a word: S, L, O, T, H — that covers 5 new letters including H.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T.\n\n But I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T — which are all high frequency.\n\n However, note that we are in the second guess and we have 5 new letters. We want to maximize the chance of getting hits.\n\n Let me check: the most common letters in 5-letter words (without C,R,A,N,E) are:\n\n According to various sources, the top letters are: E, A, R, O, T, I, S, N, etc. but we have excluded E,A,R,N. So the next are O, T, I, S, L, C (but C is out), so O, T, I, S, L.\n\n So a word with O, T, I, S, L would be ideal. But we can\'t have all in one word? Let\'s see:\n\n Words: ""TOILS"" (T, O, I, L, S) — that\'s 5 letters. Is ""TOILS"" a valid word? Yes, it is (plural of toil? or third person present of toil? but in word games, it\'s accepted).\n\n Alternatively, ""SLOTH"" (S, L, O, T, H) — H is less common.\n\n Or ""POINT"" — but P is not as common as S or T? and we have O, I, N (but N is excluded) — wait, N is excluded, so we cannot use N.\n\n So ""POINT"" has N which is excluded.\n\n Therefore, ""TOILS"" is a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S.\n\n But let me confirm: T, O, I, L, S — none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}. So it\'s valid.\n\n Another option: ""BUOYS"" — B, U, O, Y, S — but Y and U are less common.\n\n I think ""TOILS"" is a strong choice.\n\n However, note that we are only on the second guess and we have 4 more after this. We can also consider words that have more vowels? We have O and I (vowels) in ""TOILS"", and we already tried A and E and they are not in the word, so the vowels left are O, I, U. We have O and I in ""TOILS"".\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""OUPHS"" — but that\'s obscure.\n\n I think ""TOILS"" is acceptable.\n\n But let me see if there\'s a word that includes U as well? We have to cover 5 letters, so we can\'t cover everything.\n\n We can stick with ""TOILS"".\n\n However, to be safe, I\'ll choose ""MOIST"" because it\'s a common word and we get M as well, which is a common consonant.\n\n But note: M is less common than L? Actually, L is the 12th most common letter in English, M is 14th, so L is slightly more common. But in ""TOILS"" we have L and in ""MOIST"" we have M.\n\n Since we have no information, either is fine.\n\n I\'ll go with ""TOILS"" because it uses the top letters we have available: S, T, L, O, I.\n\n So, my second guess is ""TOILS"".After the first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters (C, R, A, N, E) being marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. The new guess must avoid these letters and prioritize high-frequency English letters not yet tested. Common remaining letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, and H. \n\nThe word ""TOILS"" is chosen because:\n- It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters: T, O, I, L, S.\n- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.\n- It covers common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S), increasing the chance of hits.\n\nThis guess will help identify which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>toils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1.

T is not in position 1, I is not in position 3.\n- Since T and I are present, and the word is 5 letters.\n\nAlso, note that in ""toils"", T was in position 1 and I in position 3, but those positions are wrong for these letters. So T must be in positions 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions 2, 4, or 5? The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nBut T cannot be in position 1 (as in the guess). Similarly, I cannot be in position 3.\n\nNow, T is present but not in position 1, and I is present but not in position 3.\n\nWe need to form a guess that:\n- Does not use any excluded letters: so avoid C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.\n- Must include T and I (since we know they are in the word, we should reuse them to find their positions).\n- And we should try to include new letters to gain more information.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have to include T and I in every guess? Actually, no, we can guess without them, but since we know they are in the word, it\'s efficient to place them in positions we haven\'t tested to narrow down.\n\nMoreover, we have 3 letters unknown: since T and I are already present, there are 3 other letters in the word to discover.\n\nNow, what positions are available for T? It can be in 2, 3, 4, or 5? But we don\'t know about position 2 yet. In the second guess, T was in position 1, so position 1 is wrong. But that doesn\'t tell us about other positions. So T must appear in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? And similarly, I must appear in position 1,2,4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong).\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But we haven\'t seen any indication, so we\'ll assume no duplicates for now.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: excluding C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S, we have:\nB, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we know I and T are in the word, so they can be reused? But we don\'t yet know about others.\n\nNow, we want to form a word that includes T and I, and three new letters to test.\n\nWe also know that T cannot be in position 1 (from the first letter of guess 2), and I cannot be in position 3.\n\nIn our new guess, we can try placing T in a different position to see if we get a ✓ or a -.\n\nSimilarly for I.\n\nA good strategy: place T in position 2 or 4? Since position 1 is excluded for T, and in the second guess we didn\'t test T in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, for I: avoid position 3, so try in position 1,2,4, or 5.\n\nBut we also need to pick three new letters.\n\nLet me think of common words that fit.\n\nWe can aim for a word that has T and I and three common letters: like D, H, M, P, etc.\n\nFor example, pick letters: D, H, M, along with T and I.\n\nThen form a word: possible words?\n- Must be 5 letters, and avoid C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S.\n\nPossible word: ""THUMB""? But U is available? ""THUMB"" has T,H,U,M,B. But we need to include I? Oh, I forgot we must include I.\n\nSo we need a word that has T, I, and three other new letters.\n\nLet me try: ""MIGHT"" -> M,I,G,H,T. However, that has I in position 2 and T in position 5.\n\nBut position 3? We put G there.\n\nAvailable letters: we haven\'t excluded B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n""might"" is M-I-G-H-T.\n\nBut note: we know I cannot be in position 3? Actually, in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but in our guess, we can put I anywhere? We are testing new positions.\n\nIn this guess, we can put I in position 2? That\'s allowed because we haven\'t tested I in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, T in position 5.\n\nBut we aren\'t sure what positions they are in.\n\nAnother word: ""PITHY"" -> P,I,T,H,Y. But that has I in position 2 and T in position 3? We want to avoid putting I in position 3? Actually, no, we are guessing — we can put I in position 3? The feedback will tell us if it\'s correct or not.\n\nHowever, we know from previous feedback that the secret word\'s I is not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will get an x for sure? Actually, no: because we already know I is not in position 3? So we\'d get a - if it were present but in wrong position, but we put it in the wrong position? It might be inefficient.\n\nBut note the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, we get ✓. Otherwise, if it\'s in the word but wrong position, we get -.\n\nWe know I is in the word, but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will never get ✓, only - or x? Actually, since we know it\'s not position 3, if we put it there, it should give us - (because it is in the word but wrong position). So we wouldn\'t learn much except that it\'s not there, which we already know.\n\nSimilarly for T: we know it\'s not in position 1.\n\nTo avoid redundant information, we should avoid putting T in position 1 and I in position 3.\n\nTherefore, in our new guess, place T in positions 2,3,4,5 but not 1. And I in positions 1,2,4,5 but not 3.\n\nLet me think of a word that meets these conditions.\n\nAlso, we want to use common letters not yet tested.\n\nSo: for example, T in position 2: then ? T ? ? ?\n\nOr T in position 4: then ? ? ? T ?\n\nSimilarly for I.\n\nOne idea: put I in position 1 and T in position 4? Or to maximize information, put them in positions that we haven\'t ruled out.\n\nTry: I in position 1, T in position 5, and then three new letters.\n\nSo: I _ _ _ T\n\nWhat words? Like ""INPUT"" but N and P? N is excluded (from guess 1: N is not in word).\n\nN is excluded, so not available.\n\n""QUIET"" but Q and U? Also, E is excluded.\n\nAvoid E.\n\n""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T. That works: F, I, G, H, T.\n- Positions: I in position 2? ""FIGHT"" is F-I-G-H-T, so I is in position 2, T in position 5.\n\nThat works.\n\nAlso, ""FIGHT"" uses F which is new, G, H, T, I.\n\nT is reused, I is reused.\n\nAlso, positions: I is in position 2 (we haven\'t tested I in position 2), T in position 5 (we haven\'t tested T in position 5).\n\nMoreover, we haven\'t tested F, G, H.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nAnother word: ""MIGHT"" as before: M,I,G,H,T. Same positions.\n\nBut ""FIGHT"" is valid.\n\nIs there a word with T in position 2? Like ""BOTHY"" but O is excluded and we need I? Doesn\'t work.\n\n""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> positions: P in 1, I in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5.\nBut we have T in position 3? We haven\'t tested T in position 3.\n\nAnd I in position 2? Also fine.\n\nBut note: we know I is present and T is present, so both are in the word.\n\nIn ""PITHY"", if we put T in position 3, that might be acceptable because we haven\'t tested that position for T.\n\nBut we must avoid I in position 3? Not necessary for the guess? We can put T in position 3? But we don\'t know if T is in position 3? It could be.\n\nBut note: in the feedback rule, if it is in the correct position, we get ✓.\n\nSo it\'s acceptable.\n\nHowever, comparing ""FIGHT"" and ""PITHY"", both cover similar letters.\n\nBut ""FIGHT"" tests F, which might be less common? Actually, H is common.\n\nAlso, in ""PITHY"", we have Y which is less common.\n\nSo ""FIGHT"" might be better.\n\nAnother word: ""WIGHT"" (a mythical being) - but rare? Avoid rare words? We want common words.\n\n""FIGHT"" is common.\n\nAlternatively, ""DIGHT""? Not common.\n\n""TIGHT"" - but T in position 1: but we cannot have T in position 1! Because we know T is not in the correct position if placed first? Actually, we already got - for T in position 1, meaning it\'s present but not in first position. But we can put T in the first position? We would get a - again? Because we already know it\'s not first position.\n\nBut that would be inefficient: if we put T in position 1, we know it will be - for sure.\n\nSimilarly, avoid that.\n\nSo ""TIGHT"" starts with T -> position 1: T, but we know T isn\'t in position 1, so it would be - or x? Present but wrong position -> so we\'d get -, which we already know. So wasteful.\n\nTherefore, avoid placing T in position 1 and I in position 3.\n\nBack to ""FIGHT"": letters F,I,G,H,T.\n\nPositions: \n1: F (new)\n2: I (we haven\'t tested position 2 for I)\n3: G (new)\n4: H (new)\n5: T (we haven\'t tested position 5 for T)\n\nThis tests I in position 2 and T in position 5, which were not tested before.\n\nWe might get hits.\n\nAnother possibility: ""PUPIL"" but U is not very common? and L is excluded. Wait, L is excluded? From guess 2: L(x) -> not in word.\n\nSo we cannot use L.\n\n""MUMMY"" has duplicate M? Not efficient.\n\n""DUVET"" has D,U,V,E,T? But E is excluded.\n\nSo ""FIGHT"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if the word ""FIGHT"" is allowed: yes, it\'s a standard English word.\n\nFinal guess: ""FIGHT"".\n\nHowever, note: from feedback we have T(-) meaning T is in the word but not in first position. We haven\'t tested T in position 5, so we do that.\n\nSimilarly for I: in guess 2, I was in position 3 and got -, meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 3. Now we try it in position 2.\n\nWe also test F, G, H.\n\nThis maximizes new information.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.From the feedback:\n- In Guess 1 (""crane""), all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are excluded.\n- In Guess 2 (""toils""), T is present but in the wrong position (-), O is absent (x), I is present but in the wrong position (-), L is absent (x), and S is absent (x). This means O, L, and S are excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.  \nConfirmed present letters: T and I, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.\n\nThe new guess must include T and I (to locate their correct positions) and avoid excluded letters. T cannot be placed in position 1, and I cannot be placed in position 3. To maximize information gain, I placed I in position 2 (untested) and T in position 5 (untested), while introducing three new common letters: F, G, H.\n\nThe word ""FIGHT"" meets these criteria:  \n- Positions: F (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5).  \n- Avoids excluded letters and reuses T and I in new positions.  \n- Tests F, G, and H for the first time.\n\n<guess>fight</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: fight -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.\nGuess 2: ""toils"" -> \n  T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, not at position 1)\n  O: absent\n  I: present but wrong position (so I is in the word, not at position 3)\n  L: absent\n  S: absent\nThus, O, L, S are also absent.\n\nGuess 3: ""fight"" ->\n  F: absent\n  I: correct position (so I is in the word and at position 2)\n  G: absent\n  H: absent\n  T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)\n\nNow, we know:\n- I is in the word and is in position 2.

And position 2 is now taken by I, so T must be in position 3 or 4.\n\nAlso, we have the following letters absent: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S, F, G, H.\n\nSo the absent letters are: A, C, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S.\n\nNow, the word must contain I at position 2 and T in either position 3 or 4, and two other letters that we haven\'t tried yet.\n\nWe have used 11 letters that are absent, so the remaining letters are: B, D, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that I and T are already in the word, so we are looking for the other three letters? Actually, the word has 5 letters: we have I at position 2, T at either 3 or 4, and then three other positions: 1, and then either 4 and 5 or 3 and 5? Let me clarify:\n\nThe positions:\n- Position 2: I (fixed)\n- T must be in position 3 or 4.\n\nCase 1: T in position 3.\nThen the word is: _ I T _ _\n\nCase 2: T in position 4.\nThen the word is: _ I _ T _\n\nWe need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set, excluding the absent ones.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (and T and I are already used, but we can use them again? But we assume no duplicates? Since we haven\'t seen any duplicates so far, and it\'s common in Wordle, we assume no duplicates. So each letter only once.)\n\nTherefore, we cannot use T or I again. So the other letters must be from: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, we need to form a valid English word.\n\nAlso, we have two cases for T\'s position.\n\nWe should make a guess that helps us distinguish between these cases and also tests new letters.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess.\n\nWe can try to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.\n\nWe can try a word that has T in position 3 or 4? But we don\'t know which, so we might want to test one of the cases.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven\'t tested? But we have tested T in position 1 and 5, and we know it\'s not there. We haven\'t tested position 3 or 4.\n\nBut in our guess, we can place T in position 3 to see if it\'s correct? Or in position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so we can try one.\n\nWe can also try to include other common letters.\n\nLet me think of words that fit the pattern.\n\nFirst, if T is in position 3: pattern _ I T _ _\n\nPossible words: with available letters: e.g., ""BITTY"" but T repeated? Not allowed? We assume no duplicates. Also, Y is available.\n\n""BITTY"" has two T\'s, so invalid.\n\n""MITTS"" but S is absent.\n\n""PITTA"" but A is absent.\n\n""KITTY"" again two T\'s.\n\n""WITTY"" two T\'s.\n\nNot many common words with _ I T _ _ without the absent letters.\n\nWhat about ""DITZY""? D,I,T,Z,Y. Z and Y are available.\n\nBut ""DITZY"" is a word? Yes, meaning silly or scatterbrained.\n\nBut let\'s see the pattern: D I T Z Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:T, 4:Z, 5:Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if T is in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case: _ I _ T _\n\nPossible words: e.g., ""PITHY"" but H is absent and we have I in position 2? ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y, but T is in position 3, not 4. We need T in position 4.\n\nSo _ I _ T _ : e.g., ""DIXIT"" but X and I? ""DIXIT"" is D-I-X-I-T, has two I\'s? Not allowed.\n\n""JIVED"" but E is absent.\n\n""BIDET"" but E absent.\n\n""MINTS"" S absent.\n\n""PINTS"" S absent.\n\n""VISTA"" S and A absent.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAnother idea: ""MINTY"" but N absent? N is absent.\n\n""PUDGY"" but G absent? G is absent from guess 3.\n\nG is absent.\n\nPerhaps we should not fix T in the guess? But we know T is in the word, so we should use it to find the position.\n\nBut we have to avoid positions 1 and 5 for T.\n\nSo in our guess, we can put T in position 3 or 4.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit one of the patterns and use available letters.\n\nAvailable: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPattern 1: _ I T _ _ \n\nExamples:\n- D I T C H -> but C and H absent.\n- D I T Z Y -> ""DITZY"" as above.\n\nPattern 2: _ I _ T _\n\nExamples:\n- B I D T E -> E absent.\n- M I D T ? \n- P I P T ? \n- W I T T Y -> two T\'s.\n\n""JUMBO"" but no T? We need to include T.\n\nWe must include T because it\'s in the word.\n\nAnother word: ""QUIPT"" but Q and P, and T at the end? But T cannot be at position 5? We know T is not at 5, so if we put T at 5, we get a ""-"" again? But we want to test a new position.\n\nSo let\'s try to put T in position 3 or 4.\n\nHow about ""QUITE""? But E absent.\n\n""QUIT"" is 4 letters.\n\n""QUIET"" E absent.\n\n""BUILT"" U,I,L,T but L is absent.\n\n""GUILT"" G and L absent.\n\n""JUICY"" C absent.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nPerhaps we can use a word that has T in position 3 and common letters.\n\n""MITCH"" M,I,T,C,H -> C and H absent.\n\n""BITMAP"" too long.\n\n""PITON"" O absent.\n\n""KITBAG"" A absent.\n\n""WITAN"" A and N absent.\n\nMaybe ""DITZY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s consider the other case: if we put T in position 4.\n\nWord: _ I _ T _\n\nFor example, ""DIETY"" but E absent.\n\n""PIETY"" E absent.\n\n""BIZET"" Z, but E absent and T at the end? Position 5, but we know T is not at 5, so if we put T at 5, we get ""-"" which we already know, so it\'s wasteful.\n\nIn the pattern _ I _ T _, the T is at position 4, so that\'s fine.\n\nBut we need a word.\n\n""JIVET"" J,I,V,E,T -> E absent.\n\n""VIVID"" no T.\n\n""MINIM"" no T.\n\n""PIXIE"" E absent and I repeated.\n\n""WIZUT"" not a word.\n\n""YIETY"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""DIZZY"" no T.\n\nI think we need to consider that T might be in position 3, and use ""DITZY"".\n\nOr ""MITZY"" not a word.\n\nAnother idea: ""PITKY"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps we missed some letters. Available: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWhat about ""MIXUP"" no T.\n\n""QUIPU"" no T.\n\nWe must include T.\n\nLet\'s try to form ""JUDY T"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""DUVET"" but E and V? E absent.\n\nI think we have to go with ""DITZY"" for the pattern with T in position 3.\n\nBut let\'s check if there are other words.\n\n""BITTY"" invalid.\n\n""WITTY"" invalid.\n\n""KITTY"" invalid.\n\n""MITTY"" not common.\n\n""PITTY"" not common.\n\n""TITTY"" not appropriate.\n\nSo ""DITZY"" might be the best shot.\n\nBut we also have the possibility that T is in position 4.\n\nIf we guess ""DITZY"", with T in position 3, then if the word has T in position 3, we might get a hit, else we get a - or x.\n\nBut if we get a hit for T, then we know it\'s position 3.\n\nIf we get a - for T, then T must be in position 4.\n\nSo it\'s informative.\n\nSimilarly, for the other letters.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""DITZY"".\n\nBut is ""DITZY"" a valid word? Yes, it is in some dictionaries.\n\nTo be safe, we can choose a more common word.\n\nAnother word: ""PITHY"" but H absent and T in position 3? But H is absent.\n\n""WITHY"" W,I,T,H,Y -> H absent.\n\n""KITHY"" not a word.\n\n""ZITHER"" too long.\n\nPerhaps ""DITTO"" but O absent and two T\'s.\n\nO is absent.\n\n""BIGHT"" G and H absent? In guess 3, G and H are absent.\n\nG and H are absent.\n\nIn ""DITZY"", we have D, I, T, Z, Y. Z and Y are not common, but we have to use available letters.\n\nAnother common letter: U.\n\nWord with U and T.\n\nFor example, ""QUIET"" not.\n\n""BUILT"" L absent.\n\n""DUSTY"" S absent.\n\n""JUDGY"" G absent.\n\n""FUDGY"" F and G absent.\n\nI think ""DITZY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find a word with T in position 4.\n\nFor example, ""DIVOT"" O and V? O absent.\n\n""BIGOT"" G and O absent.\n\n""PIVOT"" O absent.\n\n""WIVED"" E absent.\n\n""JIVED"" E absent.\n\n""VIVID"" no T.\n\n""YIVIS"" not a word.\n\nSo it\'s hard.\n\nPerhaps ""MIXED"" E absent.\n\nI think we should go with ""DITZY"".\n\nBut there\'s another word: ""DIZZY"" but no T.\n\nOr ""JAZZY"" no T.\n\nSo ""DITZY"" it is.\n\nBut in ""DITZY"", we have:\n- Position 1: D\n- Position 2: I (but we know I is correct at position 2, so it will be ✓)\n- Position 3: T\n- Position 4: Z\n- Position 5: Y\n\nWe will get feedback on D, T, Z, Y.\n\nIf T is in position 3 in the secret word, we get T(✓), else if T is in position 4, we get T(-) because it\'s present but not at 3.\n\nAnd we test D, Z, Y.\n\nSo it\'s informative.\n\nWe can also consider ""PZAZZ"" not a word.\n\nSo I think ""DITZY"" is the best we can do.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we expect.\n\nSecret word has I at position 2, T at either 3 or 4, and three other letters from available set.\n\nIf we guess ""DITZY"":\n- D: could be absent or present? We don\'t know.\n- I: will be ✓ (position 2)\n- T: if secret word has T at position 3, then ✓, else if at position 4, then - (because present but not at 3)\n- Z: ?\n- Y: ?\n\nThen based on feedback, we can proceed.\n\nAnother word: ""JITTY"" not common, and T at position 3? J,I,T,T,Y two T\'s.\n\nInvalid.\n\n""BITTY"" invalid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DITZY"".\n\nBut to be more common, what about ""MIXTY"" not a word.\n\nOr ""VITZY"" not.\n\nSo ""DITZY"" is acceptable.\n\nPerhaps ""DICKY"" but C and K? C is absent.\n\nC is absent.\n\nSo no.\n\n""DIKED"" E absent.\n\n""DIKEY"" not common.\n\nI think we have to use ""DITZY"".\n\nBut let\'s think of a different approach: maybe we don\'t put I in position 2? But we know I is fixed at position 2, so in our guess, we must have I at position 2 to avoid wasting a position? Because if we put I elsewhere, we know it will be - or x, but since it\'s fixed at 2, if we put it elsewhere, it will be - (because present but wrong position), which we already know, so it\'s better to keep it at position 2 to free up other positions for new letters.\n\nIn this case, for position 2, we must put I, because it\'s correct and we can get a ✓, which doesn\'t cost us information.\n\nSo position 2 must be I.\n\nThen for T, we put it in a new position, say 3 or 4.\n\nSo ""DITZY"" is fine.\n\nAnother word: ""PITZA"" not a word.\n\n""PIZZA"" has Z twice and A absent.\n\nNot.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""DITZY"".\n\nBut let\'s write it.\n\n<guess>ditzy</guess>\n\nBut we have to make sure it\'s 5 letters.\n\nD-I-T-Z-Y.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps ""WIFTY"" not a word.\n\nSo I think that\'s it.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n   - **Guess 2 (""toils"")**: \n     - T is present but wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 1.\n     - O, L, S are absent (x). Excluded letters: O, L, S.\n     - I is present but wrong position (-), so I is in the word but not at position 3.\n   - **Guess 3 (""fight"")**:\n     - F, G, H are absent (x). Excluded letters: F, G, H.\n     - I is correct position (✓), so I is in the word and fixed at position 2.\n     - T is present but wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 5.\n   \n   **Summary**:\n   - Excluded letters (15 total): A, C, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S (from guesses 1-3).\n   - Confirmed letters: \n     - I is fixed at position 2 (from ""fight"" ✓).\n     - T is present but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""toils"" - at pos 1 and ""fight"" - at pos 5). T must be in position 3 or 4.\n   - Remaining letters available (not excluded and not yet used): B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n   - Since I and T are confirmed, the word has 3 unknown letters from the remaining pool. No duplicates are assumed.\n\n2. **Deduce Word Structure**:\n   - Position 2 is fixed as I.\n   - T must be in position 3 or 4 (positions 1 and 5 are ruled out for T).\n   - Two possible patterns:\n     - If T is in position 3: `_ I T _ _`\n     - If T is in position 4: `_ I _ T _`\n   - The unknown positions (1, 3/4, and 5) must be filled with letters from the available set (B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:\n   - Prioritize testing T\'s position to resolve ambiguity (position 3 vs. 4) while introducing new high-frequency letters.\n   - Place T in position 3 to test if it is correct (if not, T must be in position 4).\n   - Fill other positions with common unused letters (e.g., D, Y, Z) to maximize information.\n   - Avoid redundant placements (e.g., I is fixed at position 2, so no need to test elsewhere; T should not be placed in positions 1 or 5).\n\n4. **Word Selection**:\n   - Target pattern: `_ I T _ _` (to test T in position 3).\n   - Possible words: ""DITZY"" fits the pattern and uses available letters (D, Z, Y are new and relatively common).\n     - D in position 1 (new).\n     - I in position 2 (fixed, will be ✓).\n     - T in position 3 (testing for correctness).\n     - Z in position 4 (new).\n     - Y in position 5 (new).\n   - ""DITZY"" is a valid English word (meaning silly or scatterbrained) and tests:\n     - Whether T is in position 3 (✓ or -).\n     - Presence of D, Z, Y (which could be in the word or absent).\n\n5. **Expected Outcomes**:\n   - If T is in position 3: Feedback will show T(✓), confirming T\'s position.\n   - If T is not in position 3: Feedback will show T(-), confirming T must be in position 4.\n   - Feedback on D, Z, Y will reveal if any are present, narrowing possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>ditzy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: fight -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)\nGuess 4: ditzy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) T(✓) Z(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""ditzy"" -> D(x) I(✓) T(✓) Z(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- D: absent (so D is not in the word)
- I: correct and in position 2
- T: correct and in position 3
- Z: absent
- Y: correct and in position 5

So now we know:
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: T
- Position 5: Y
- Therefore, the word is _ I T _ Y

Also, we have the following letters excluded (from previous feedback):
- From Guess 1: C, R, A, N, E (all absent)
- From Guess 2: O, L, S (absent) and note T and I are present (but we now know their positions)
- From Guess 3: F, G, H (absent)
- From Guess 4: D, Z (absent)

So excluded letters: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S, Z (13 letters)

Available letters: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X

Now, the secret word is _ I T _ Y, and we need to fill the first and fourth positions with two letters from the available set, without duplicates (since all letters so far are distinct).

We must find a valid English word of the form [letter1] I T [letter2] Y.

Now, we test letter1 and letter2 from the available pool.

Common possibilities: we need words ending with ""ITY"", but with a letter in between? Actually, it's I T [letter2] Y, so the ending is ""T?Y"".

Pattern: * I T * Y

Let's think of common words:
- ""PITY"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.
- ""MITY""? Not common.
- ""CITY"" but C is excluded.
- ""KITTY"" has two T's and T is already in position 3? Also, K and Y: but we have position 1 and 4. ""KITTY"" is K-I-T-T-Y -> two T's so invalid because we assumed no duplicates.

Actually, we must avoid duplicates because we haven't seen any duplicate letters so far.

Possible words:
- ""B"" as first letter: ""BITY? What? ""B"" I T * Y -> e.g., ""BITTY"" has two T's -> invalid.
- ""M"" as first: ""MITY""? ""MITY"" is not a word. ""MISTY"" but S excluded and position 4 is T? No, position 4 must be empty.

Specifically, the word must be 5 letters: first letter, then I, T, fourth letter, Y.

So: ? I T ? Y

Common words: 
- ""PITHY"" but H and we have I? But ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y -> H is excluded (from guess 3: H absent). So not.
- ""WITTY"" has two T's -> invalid.
- ""DITTY"" D excluded and two T's -> no.

Available letters: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X.

Try P: ""PIT*Y"" -> possibilities: ""PITAY""? A excluded. ""PITEY""? E excluded. ""PITY"" is 4 letters. Not.

With M: ""MITY""? Not a word. ""MISTY"" S excluded.

J: ""J"" I T ? Y -> ""JITNY""? N excluded. ""JITHY""? H excluded. No common word.

K: ""K"" I T ? Y -> ""KITTY"" invalid duplicate. ""KITHY""? H excluded. ""KITSY""? S excluded.

Q: ""Q"" I T ? Y -> ""QIT"" not a word.

U: ""U"" I T ? Y -> ""UIT"" not. ""UNIT"" E? ""UNITY"" -> U-N-I-T-Y? But N is excluded. And positions: if ""UNITY"", it would be U(1), N(2) but we need I at position 2. Conflict.

V: ""V"" I T ? Y -> ""VIT*Y"". ""VITAY""? A excluded. ""VITY"" not 5 letters.

W: ""W"" I T ? Y -> ""WITTY"" duplicate. ""WITLY""? L excluded. ""WINDY"" N excluded and D excluded. ""WILLY"" L excluded and duplicate L? Not.

X: ""X"" I T ? Y -> ""XITY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""MINTY"" but N excluded and M-I-N-T-Y -> but position 2 should be I, so ""MINTY"" has M(1), I(2), but then N(3) but we need T at position 3. Conflict.

Wait, we have position 3 fixed as T. So the word is [letter1] I T [letter4] Y.

So ""M"" I T ""?"" Y: e.g., ""MITTY"" which is not common and has two T's? Not allowed.

Another idea: ""PITY"" extended? No.

Perhaps I missed a letter: U. ""U"" I T ? Y: ""UITWY"" no.

But note: available letters include B, so ""B"" I T ? Y -> ""BITBY""? No. ""BITSY""? S excluded.

Now, real English words: 
- ""BIGLY"" G and L excluded? Not.

Possible words: 
- ""PIETY"": P-I-E-T-Y -> but E is excluded, and T is in position 4? Wait, ""PIETY"" is P-I-E-T-Y -> positions: P1, I2, E3, T4, Y5? But we need T at position 3. So position 3 is E, but we need it as T. So conflict.

In ""PIETY"", T is at position 4, which would be our fourth slot? So pattern: P-I-E-T-Y? But in our case, position 3 must be T, so it can't be E. Therefore, not matching.

We need a word where after I is T. So the third letter is T.

For example, ""CITY"" is C-I-T-Y? That's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

The word ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y -> that's 5 letters: positions 1:P, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:Y. However, H is excluded (from Guess 3: H absent). So not.

Similarly, ""WITHY"" W-I-T-H-Y -> H absent.

""KITTY"" K-I-T-T-Y -> two T's -> not allowed.

""BATTY"" -> A and two T's? A excluded.

""MITT"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""DITTY"" -> D and two T's? D excluded.

But we have excluded so many letters.

Another possibility: ""POTTY"" O excluded and two T's.

We must find a word with the correct pattern and using only available letters.

Available: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X

Now, let's try ""MITBY"" not a word.

""BITMY"" not.

"" JIT "" not.

Perhaps ""VITAY"" not.

Wait, one word: ""PIXIE"" -> P-I-X-I-E -> but two I's? And E excluded. Not.

Another word: ""MIXUP"" U and P -> M-I-X-U-P -> positions: M1, I2, X3, U4, P5? But we need T at position 3? Here it is X. So unless X is T? No, T is required.

The only word I can think of is ""MISTY"" but S excluded.

Wait, perhaps ""WIGHT"" -> W-I-G-H-T -> but G and H absent? Also, T is at the end? But we need T at position 3? Here it is position 5: W1,I2,G3,H4,T5? But we need T at 3 and Y at 5? Not matching.

We need Y at position 5.

So words ending in Y with the pattern * I T * Y.

Common words: ""NITRY"" not common? ""NITTY"" N excluded and duplicate T.

""RITZY"" R excluded and Z excluded.

But we haven't used B, M, P, and some others.

Perhaps ""BINTY"" not a word.

""PINTY"" not.

""JUMBY"" J,U,M,B,Y -> but does it fit ""J"" I T ? Y -> no T.

We must have T at position 3.

Think of: city -> 4 letters. 
pity -> 4.

But there is ""PITHY"" which is 5, but H absent.

Another word: ""WIFTY"" not common, and F excluded.

Perhaps ""Z"" but Z absent.

I recall a word: ""ditzy"" was used, and now we need a new guess with the constraints.

Perhaps ""kitty"" is not allowed because duplicate.

Another word: ""MITTS"" is not allowed because duplicate T and S absent.

Wait, the only common word that fits is ""PITY"" but 4 letters? There must be one.

Let's list all English words of form [B J K M P Q U V W X] I T [B J K M P Q U V W X] Y

For example, with M: M I T ? Y

What can the fourth letter be? It has to form a word.

M I T H Y: h absent -> not.

M I T M Y: invalid duplicate if we avoid duplicates? We don't know for sure that there is a duplicate, but we haven't seen any duplicate so far, so we keep that assumption.

Similarly, M I T B Y: is ""MITBY"" a word? No.

M I T J Y: ""MITJY"" no.

Similarly for other starting letters.

With B: B I T B Y? ""BITBY"" not a word.

B I T J Y no.

With P: P I T B Y: ""PITBY"" not a word.

P I T P Y: duplicate.

P I T K Y: ""PITKY"" not a word.

With K: K I T K Y: duplicate.

K I T M Y: ""KITMY"" not.

With W: W I T B Y: ""WITBY"" not.

W I T M Y: ""WITMY"" not.

With U: U I T B Y: ""UITBY"" not.

Etc.

Perhaps ""BITTY"" is 5-letter: B-I-T-T-Y, but two T's -> not allowed.

The word ""pithy"" came to mind again, but H is excluded.

Another word: ""dirty"" D and R excluded.

""misty"" M-I-S-T-Y: S excluded.

""cattily"" too long.

Perhaps ""testy"" T at the beginning? Not pattern.

We must have T at position 3.

Maybe ""latin"" not.

Wait, perhaps ""METY"" not.

I think we have a limited pool.

Another uncommon word: ""vitry"" not English.

Perhaps ""brit"" is shorter.

Or ""witty"" has duplicate T.

Given the constraints, perhaps we missed a letter. Available letters include U, so ""QUIET"" not, but ""QUITE"" E excluded.

""QUINT"" N excluded.

""QUIT"" 4 letters.

""QUIM"" not helpful.

Perhaps The word is ""PITHY"" is not allowed.

But in the feedback, we already have excluded letters.

Another idea: what if there is a duplicate letter? But we haven't seen any, so we keep the no-duplicate assumption.

Perhaps ""BUTTY"" B-U-T-T-Y, but U and duplicate T, and also T at position 3? ""BUTTY"" is B-U-T-T-Y -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:T,4:T,5:Y -> two T's, so invalid.

 similarly.

Perhaps ""kithe"" not 5 and not.

After reevaluating feedback, we see that in Guess 4, we have Y at position 5 is correct. And we have I at 2 and T at 3 correct.

So the word is for sure * I T * Y.

Now, letters not excluded: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X.

For the fourth letter (position 4), it must be one of these, and it forms the word.

For example, ""MITY"" is not a word, but with a first letter: e.g., ""EMITY"" E excluded and no.

""AMITY"" A excluded.

""        "" 

Perhaps ""PIXY"" not, but """"PIXTY"" not a word.

But there is ""PIETY"" but E excluded and position 3 is E, not T? ""PIETY"" is P-I-E-T-Y -> position 3 is E, not T. But we need position 3 to be T, so it doesn't match.

Similarly, ""DUTY"" D excluded and shorter.

I think the only possibility is that our assumption of no duplicates is wrong, or we missed a word.

Let's think of words ending in ""ITY"": like ""CITY"" -> 4.

""MOBILITY"" too long.

""MAJESTY"" not matching pattern.

""BAY   "" not.

Another idea: ""BITTY"" might be accepted as a word? But it has two T's, and we haven't encountered a duplicate, but it's possible.

In Guess 4, ""ditzy"" has D,I,T,Z,Y — all distinct.

No indication of duplicates.

But perhaps in the secret word, there is a duplicate? Unlikely at this stage.

Perhaps Z is not excluded yet? No, in Guess 4, Z(x), so absent.

Let's list again the available letters: B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X.

Now, possible words:
- ""JUICY"" but C excluded and U-I-C-Y -> not.
- ""BUMPY"" M and P, but positions: B-U-M-P-Y -> not I at position 2 and T at 3.
- ""Jumpy"" J-U-M-P-Y -> no I and T at 2 and 3.

We need the second letter to be I, third to be T.

So must be: first letter and fourth letter from the list.

Common words I can find are rare, but one word: ""TIGHT"" T at position 1 and G and H absent.

Not.

""LIGHT"" L and G,H absent.

Another word: ""NIGHT"" N and H absent.

Perhaps ""fight"" was used, and G,H absent.

The only word I can think of is ""mity"" not, or "" bit my"" not.

Perhaps ""MID DY"" not.

We have to consider that position 4 might be U or something.

For example, ""U"" as fourth letter: ""? I T U Y""

English words: ""SITUY"" no. ""PITUY"" no.

Except for ""bitus"" not.

Perhaps ""VITUS"" not valid.

It's possible that the word is ""MITIS"" but S excluded and ""Mitis"" may not be common.

But let's look for an answer: perhaps ""PITHY"" is not the only option, but H is excluded.

I recall that in the feedback, we have I and T and Y fixed.

So the word must be like XITY, but 4 letters, or something 5.

Another word: ""BATTY"" has A and double T? B-A-T-T-Y -> A excluded and two T's.

 not.

""DITTO"" O excluded.

""TINTY"" T at position 1 and N excluded.

After research, I think ""WITTY"" is the only common word, but it has two T's.

Perhaps in this game, ""WITTY"" could be used, but we have not seen any duplicate, so it's risky.

Gather the known correct letters: positions 2,3,5: I, T, Y.

And we have to fill position 1 and 4.

Position 4 must be a letter that can form T*Y? But in English, words like: empty, but E excluded.

Ample not.

Perhaps ""Q"" Q I T ? Y? ""QITY"" or ""QUITY"" not words.

Another possibility: ""CITY"" is 4, but ""CITYe"" not.

I think we have to guess with the available letters.

For example, ""PITY"" is 4 letters, so not.

Perhaps ""MIGHT"" but G and H absent, and M-I-G-H-T -> position 3 G, not T.

Not matching.

Let's try ""KIPY"" not.

Perhaps ""JITNEY"" len 6.

I am out of ideas.

Another thought: perhaps the word is ""picky"" but C excluded and no T.

Our known letters require I at 2, T at 3.

So the word is [letter1] I T [letter4] Y

With letters4 from B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X.

The only common word I can now think of is ""PITKY"" but not a word, or ""MITBY"" not.

Perhaps ""W"" I T ""H Y"" with H? But H is excluded.

Wait, there is the word ""WITHY"" W-I-T-H-Y , which means a tough gn willow, and H is in it, but H was guess3 and is absent, so can't be.

But in Guess3, H(x) -> not in word, so cannot.

Similarly, ""PITHY"" not.

Let's double-check excluded letters:
- Guess1: C,R,A,N,E (x)
- Guess2: O,L,S (x), and T and I present
- Guess3: F,G,H (x)
- Guess4: D,Z (x)

So H is excluded.

We must use only the available letters.

Possibly "" B"" I T ""W"" Y -> ""BITWY"" not a word.
"" J"" I T ""M"" Y -> ""JITMY"" not.
"" M"" I T ""V"" Y -> ""MITVY"" not.
"" P"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""PITUY"" not.

 rare word ""quitz"" not.

Perhaps ""UM "" not.

I think we have to choose a word that exists, like ""MITTY"" even if rare, or accept duplication.

But let's look online or think harder.

Another word: ""KICKS"" not.

 perhaps ""bicep"" not.

I recall that ""party"" but A and R excluded.

"" ofالا

Perhaps ""PIXIE"" not matching.

One last idea: ""DITZY"" was used, but the secret word might be ""DIZZY"" but Z is excluded and D excluded, but in feedback for ""ditzy"", Z(x), so not in word, and D(x), so not. ""DIZZY"" has Z and D, both absent.

So not.

Given the difficulty, maybe the word is ""city"" but it's 4 letters, so must be 5.

Unless the puzzle allows plurals? But ""cities"" is 6.

 ""pits"" not.

I think we have to make a guess with the pattern and available letters.

For example, ""M"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""MITYU"" not a word.

Perhaps ""V"" I T ""A"" Y -> A excluded.

""B"" I T ""E"" Y -> E excluded.

""B"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""BITYU"" not.

The only letter left is why not ""U"" - like ""U"" I T ""B"" Y: ""UITYB"" not.

Perhaps the fourth letter is P: ""P"" I T ""P"" Y -> duplicate.

Or ""W"" I T ""W"" Y -> duplicate.

So with 10 available letters, none form a common word.

But there must be a word. We missed ""K"" for the fourth letter: ""K"" I T ""K"" Y -> ""KITKY"" not.

And ""B"" for fourth: ""B"" I T ""B"" Y -> ""BITBY"" not.

Perhaps ""J"" forfirst and ""B"" for fourth: ""J"" I T ""B"" Y -> ""JITBY"" not a word.

Similarly, ""J"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""JITYU"" not.

""P"" I T ""K"" Y -> ""PITKY"" not.

But "" PIT key"" not.

Another common word: ""MINTY"" not matching pattern.

Perhaps ""dirty"" but letters excluded.

 I think one English word is ""pithy"", but H is absent.

Or ""withy"", same thing.

Perhaps ""vughy"" not.

Given the constraints, perhaps the word is ""BITOKY"" not.

Or maybe in Allow, ""JITNEY"" is too long.

I see an error: position 4 is between T and Y, so the word is ? I T ? Y

Letters that can be for position 4: vowels like U, so ""ITUY"" not a syllable.

Perhaps ""ITEM"" not.

Let's search for 5-letter words ending in ""Y"" with third letter ""T"" and second letter ""I"".

For example, in English, we have:
- A little common: ""PITHY"", ""WITHY"", "" DITCHY"" not, ""KITTY"", "" BITTY"", ""WITTY"", "" MITTY"", ""NITTY"", ""PITTY"", ""TITTY"", ""ZITTY"", etc.

Among these, ""PITHY"" and ""WITHY"" have H, which is excluded.
""KITTY"", ""BITTY"", etc., have two T's, so if we allow duplicates, then ""KITTY"" could be, but it has T at position 3 and 4, so duplicate T.

But in the secret word, we know T is at position 3, so if there is another T at position 4, it would be duplicate.

Similarly, "" WITTY"" has T at position 3 and 4.

In Guess 4, we have ""ditzy"" dit zy, so D-I-T-Z-Y. If the secret word had two T's, then in position 4 is Z, which is absent, so we got Z(x), and for T at position 3, we got T(✓), but if there were another T, it would have shown in feedback? Let's review the feedback rules.

The feedback for ""ditzy"":
- D: absent (x)
- I: correct position (✓)
- T: correct position (✓)
- Z: absent (x)
- Y: correct position (✓)

If the secret word had another T, say at position 4, then when we placed Z at position 4, we would have expected a feedback for that position: the letter Y is at position 5 and is correct, but for position 4, we put Z, which is not T, but T is in the word not at that position? If secret has T at position 4, and we put Z, then the feedback for that position is 'x' for Z, and for the T in the word, since we already have one T that is correctly placed (position 3), and if there is another T, it should be marked as present if not correct.

But note: feedback only marks a letter as present (-) if it is in the word but not in that position, and if there are multiple, but in this case, for each guess position, only one symbol.

But in our guess, position 4 is Z and we got 'x', so Z is not in the word. If there were a T at position 4, then for the T overall, we have one T matched at position 3 with ✓, and another T could be elsewhere? But in our guess, we didn't place a T at position 4, so we would have a '-' for the T that is at position 4 only if we placed a T in another position and it got matched? It's complicated.

To simplify, in feedback, for each letter in the guess, it checks the secret word:

- For the T in position 3 of the guess, it matches the T in position 3 of the secret, so it's ✓.
- If there is another T in the secret at position 4, when we place Z at position 4, it will be 'x' because Z not present, and with no additional feedback since we didn't place T for the extra T.

So the feedback does not reveal the presence of duplicate letters in other positions if we don't guess those letters.

But for position 4, we guessed Z and it's 'x', so that position is not T in the secret? Not necessarily: it's 'x' means the secret does not have Z at any position, but the letter in position 4 of the secret could be something else.

If the secret had a T at position 4, then when we place Z at position 4, we get 'x' for not being T or present, but the T at position 4 is not reflected because we didn't put a T there.

In summary, the feedback does not indicate the presence of a letter in a position we didn't guess.

But for the letter T, we are only placing it at position 3, so if there is another T in the secret, we wouldn't know yet.

So it's possible that the secret has a duplicate T.

For example, secret word ""WITTY"" W-I-T-T-Y.

But in ""ditzy"", when we put T at position 3, it got ✓, and for position 4, we put Z (x), so that doesn't reveal the true letter at position 4.

Then position 1 is W, position 4 is T, position 5 is Y.

But ""WITTY"" has I at 2, T at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

Then with available letters, W is available.

Then for position 1, we have W, and position 4 should be T.

But T is already at position 3, so duplicate.

In guess 4, we put D for position 1, which is not W, so x.

So secret could be ""WITTY"" and it uses letters W, I, T, T, Y.

But feedback for Guess 4: for position 1, D (x) -> correct.
 position 2: I (✓)
 position 3: T (✓)
 position 4: Z (x) -> correct.
 position 5: Y (✓)

So it's compatible, but not revealed duplicate.

Similarly, ""KITTY"" K-I-T-T-Y, with K as position 1.

Or ""BITTY"" B-I-T-T-Y.

 etc.

So perhaps we should guess a word that has T at position 4 to test or accept duplicates.

Since we have positions 2,3,5 known, we for the fourth guess, we have to guess position 1 and 4.

To test, we can guess a word that has position 1 and 4 filled.

For example, ""W"" for position 1 and ""T"" for position 4: ""W I T T Y"", אבל this has two T's and we are guessing T at position 4, which might give - if not correct, or ✓ if correct.

But if the secret has T at position 4, we get T(✓), otherwise, etc.

Since we have only one guess left for positions let's say, but we have two guesses left overall.

We are at guess 4 feedback, so next is guess 5.

So for the fifth guess, we can try ""WITTY"" to test.

If it is, we win.

If not, etc.

Or ""KITTY"" etc.

But let's choose ""WITTY"" as a common word.

So guess: ""WITTY""

Then we will see.

 another common one is ""KITTY"".

But ""W"" is available.

So ""WITTY"" is W-I-T-T-Y.

We know I at 2, T at 3, Y at 5 will be correct, so feedback will show:
- W: position 1 -> ""W"" in secret? If yes, ✓ or -
- T: position 4 -> if T, then ✓, else if present, - or x.

But we already know T is present, so for position 4, if T, ✓, else - if present but wrong position? But if not, x.

In ""WITTY"", we put duplicate T, so the T at position 4 may be 'x' if not present? No, since T is in the word, if it's not in position 4, we get - if there is another occurrence to match? Feedback rules: each guess letter is evaluated; if the letter is in the word, but that position is wrong, we get -.

For the second T at position 4 in ""WITTY"", if the secret has a T at position 4, we get ✓ for that T. If not, we get - if there is another T position (which there isn't because position 3 is T, but it's already used), it might not get - because we already matched the T.

It's messy.

 the standard way: in feedback, for each letter in guess, it checks against the secret.

- Position 1: W. If the secret's position 1 is W, then ✓. Otherwise, if W is in the secret but not at position 1, then -.
- Position 2: I. Will be ✓.
- Position 3: T. Will be ✓.
- Position 4: T. If secret position 4 is T, then ✓. Otherwise, if there is another T not yet matched, then -.
- Position 5: Y. Will be ✓.

The secret has at least two T's. If not, feedback for position 4 will be x for the second T in the guess letter.

If the secret has exactly one T, then the T at position 4 will be x.

But in this case, for ""ditzy"", we had T at position 3 and got only one 'T' in feedback? We got T(✓) for position 3, and no indication of position 4 because we didn't put T there.

But it's possible that there is another T in position 4.

So to discredit, we can assume no duplicate and keep looking, or guess a word that assumes no duplicate.

Another possibility: ""JIVEY"" not.

I think we have to guess ""WITTY"" or similar.

Or ""PITAY"" not.

Perhaps the letter is U as in ""DUTY"" excluded.

Let's list all existing words that match the pattern.

From an English dictionary, words like:
- ""pithy""
- ""withy""
- ""ditty"" ( duplicate T? ""DITTY"" is D-I-T-T-Y -> two T's)
- ""kitty""
- "" bitty""

All these either have duplicate T or exclude letters.

Other words: "" city"" only 4.

So for the sake ofゲーム, we guess ""WITTY"".

<guess>WITTY</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Previous Feedback Analysis**:
   - **Guess 1: crane → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**:
     - Letters C, R, A, N, E are absent → Excluded: A, C, E, N, R.
   - **Guess 2: toils → FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)**:
     - T is present but not in position 1.
     - I is present but not in position 3.
     - O, L, S are absent → Excluded: L, O, S.
   - **Guess 3: fight → FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)**:
     - I is in position 2 (fixed).
     - T is present but not in position 5.
     - F, G, H are absent → Excluded: F, G, H.
   - **Guess 4: ditzy → FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) T(✓) Z(x) Y(✓)**:
     - I is in position 2 (confirmed).
     - T is in position 3 (fixed).
     - Y is in position 5 (fixed).
     - D and Z are absent → Excluded: D, Z.

2. **Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 2: I
     - Position 3: T
     - Position 5: Y
   - **Remaining Positions**: Position 1 and position 4 are unknown.
   - **Excluded Letters**: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S, Z (13 letters).
   - **Available Letters**: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X (10 letters).
   - **Word Pattern**: `[position1] I T [position4] Y`.
   - **No Duplicates Assumed**: No duplicate letters indicated in previous feedback.

3. **Word Selection**:
   - Goal: Fill position 1 and 4 with unused letters from the available pool.
   - Constraints:
     - Must be a valid English word.
     - Avoids excluded letters and duplicates.
     - Common words like ""PITHY"" (H excluded), ""WITHY"" (H excluded), ""KITTY"" (duplicate T), or ""BITTY"" (duplicate T) are invalid.
   - Challenge: No common words fit the pattern `[B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X] I T [B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X] Y`.
   - After reviewing:
     - Rare words (e.g., ""DITZY"" was used) are not helpful here.
     - ""WITTY"" is a common word that fits the pattern (W-I-T-T-Y) but introduces a duplicate T.
     - However:
       - Duplicate T is possible since feedback doesn't explicitly deny duplicates (e.g., ""ditzy"" gave T(✓) for only one position).
       - ""WITTY"" tests for a duplicate T scenario:
         - Position 1: W (new letter).
         - Position 4: T (potential duplicate).
         - If correct, W(✓) and T(✓) at position 4 confirms duplicate T.
         - If not, feedback will provide new information (e.g., x or - for T at position 4, revealing its true position).
   - ""WITTY"" uses high-frequency letters and is a strategic guess to resolve ambiguity:
     - W is available and commonly used.
     - Tests for duplicate T.

4. **Strategic Choice**:  
   - Guessing ""WITTY"" maximizes information gain for the final guess by:
     - Potentially confirming the secret word.
     - Revealing the status of position 1 (if W is correct/incorrect) and position 4 (if T is present there).
   - Alternative words like ""KITTY"" or ""BITTY"" are less optimal due to lower letter frequency.

<guess>witty</guess>",WITTY,"We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""ditzy"" -> D(x) I(✓) T(✓) Z(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- D: absent (so D is not in the word)
- I: correct and in position 2
- T: correct and in position 3
- Z: absent
- Y: correct and in position 5

So now we know:
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: T
- Position 5: Y
- Therefore, the word is _ I T _ Y

Also, we have the following letters excluded (from previous feedback):
- From Guess 1: C, R, A, N, E (all absent)
- From Guess 2: O, L, S (absent) and note T and I are present (but we now know their positions)
- From Guess 3: F, G, H (absent)
- From Guess 4: D, Z (absent)

So excluded letters: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S, Z (13 letters)

Available letters: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X

Now, the secret word is _ I T _ Y, and we need to fill the first and fourth positions with two letters from the available set, without duplicates (since all letters so far are distinct).

We must find a valid English word of the form [letter1] I T [letter2] Y.

Now, we test letter1 and letter2 from the available pool.

Common possibilities: we need words ending with ""ITY"", but with a letter in between? Actually, it's I T [letter2] Y, so the ending is ""T?Y"".

Pattern: * I T * Y

Let's think of common words:
- ""PITY"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.
- ""MITY""? Not common.
- ""CITY"" but C is excluded.
- ""KITTY"" has two T's and T is already in position 3? Also, K and Y: but we have position 1 and 4. ""KITTY"" is K-I-T-T-Y -> two T's so invalid because we assumed no duplicates.

Actually, we must avoid duplicates because we haven't seen any duplicate letters so far.

Possible words:
- ""B"" as first letter: ""BITY? What? ""B"" I T * Y -> e.g., ""BITTY"" has two T's -> invalid.
- ""M"" as first: ""MITY""? ""MITY"" is not a word. ""MISTY"" but S excluded and position 4 is T? No, position 4 must be empty.

Specifically, the word must be 5 letters: first letter, then I, T, fourth letter, Y.

So: ? I T ? Y

Common words: 
- ""PITHY"" but H and we have I? But ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y -> H is excluded (from guess 3: H absent). So not.
- ""WITTY"" has two T's -> invalid.
- ""DITTY"" D excluded and two T's -> no.

Available letters: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X.

Try P: ""PIT*Y"" -> possibilities: ""PITAY""? A excluded. ""PITEY""? E excluded. ""PITY"" is 4 letters. Not.

With M: ""MITY""? Not a word. ""MISTY"" S excluded.

J: ""J"" I T ? Y -> ""JITNY""? N excluded. ""JITHY""? H excluded. No common word.

K: ""K"" I T ? Y -> ""KITTY"" invalid duplicate. ""KITHY""? H excluded. ""KITSY""? S excluded.

Q: ""Q"" I T ? Y -> ""QIT"" not a word.

U: ""U"" I T ? Y -> ""UIT"" not. ""UNIT"" E? ""UNITY"" -> U-N-I-T-Y? But N is excluded. And positions: if ""UNITY"", it would be U(1), N(2) but we need I at position 2. Conflict.

V: ""V"" I T ? Y -> ""VIT*Y"". ""VITAY""? A excluded. ""VITY"" not 5 letters.

W: ""W"" I T ? Y -> ""WITTY"" duplicate. ""WITLY""? L excluded. ""WINDY"" N excluded and D excluded. ""WILLY"" L excluded and duplicate L? Not.

X: ""X"" I T ? Y -> ""XITY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""MINTY"" but N excluded and M-I-N-T-Y -> but position 2 should be I, so ""MINTY"" has M(1), I(2), but then N(3) but we need T at position 3. Conflict.

Wait, we have position 3 fixed as T. So the word is [letter1] I T [letter4] Y.

So ""M"" I T ""?"" Y: e.g., ""MITTY"" which is not common and has two T's? Not allowed.

Another idea: ""PITY"" extended? No.

Perhaps I missed a letter: U. ""U"" I T ? Y: ""UITWY"" no.

But note: available letters include B, so ""B"" I T ? Y -> ""BITBY""? No. ""BITSY""? S excluded.

Now, real English words: 
- ""BIGLY"" G and L excluded? Not.

Possible words: 
- ""PIETY"": P-I-E-T-Y -> but E is excluded, and T is in position 4? Wait, ""PIETY"" is P-I-E-T-Y -> positions: P1, I2, E3, T4, Y5? But we need T at position 3. So position 3 is E, but we need it as T. So conflict.

In ""PIETY"", T is at position 4, which would be our fourth slot? So pattern: P-I-E-T-Y? But in our case, position 3 must be T, so it can't be E. Therefore, not matching.

We need a word where after I is T. So the third letter is T.

For example, ""CITY"" is C-I-T-Y? That's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

The word ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y -> that's 5 letters: positions 1:P, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:Y. However, H is excluded (from Guess 3: H absent). So not.

Similarly, ""WITHY"" W-I-T-H-Y -> H absent.

""KITTY"" K-I-T-T-Y -> two T's -> not allowed.

""BATTY"" -> A and two T's? A excluded.

""MITT"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""DITTY"" -> D and two T's? D excluded.

But we have excluded so many letters.

Another possibility: ""POTTY"" O excluded and two T's.

We must find a word with the correct pattern and using only available letters.

Available: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X

Now, let's try ""MITBY"" not a word.

""BITMY"" not.

"" JIT "" not.

Perhaps ""VITAY"" not.

Wait, one word: ""PIXIE"" -> P-I-X-I-E -> but two I's? And E excluded. Not.

Another word: ""MIXUP"" U and P -> M-I-X-U-P -> positions: M1, I2, X3, U4, P5? But we need T at position 3? Here it is X. So unless X is T? No, T is required.

The only word I can think of is ""MISTY"" but S excluded.

Wait, perhaps ""WIGHT"" -> W-I-G-H-T -> but G and H absent? Also, T is at the end? But we need T at position 3? Here it is position 5: W1,I2,G3,H4,T5? But we need T at 3 and Y at 5? Not matching.

We need Y at position 5.

So words ending in Y with the pattern * I T * Y.

Common words: ""NITRY"" not common? ""NITTY"" N excluded and duplicate T.

""RITZY"" R excluded and Z excluded.

But we haven't used B, M, P, and some others.

Perhaps ""BINTY"" not a word.

""PINTY"" not.

""JUMBY"" J,U,M,B,Y -> but does it fit ""J"" I T ? Y -> no T.

We must have T at position 3.

Think of: city -> 4 letters. 
pity -> 4.

But there is ""PITHY"" which is 5, but H absent.

Another word: ""WIFTY"" not common, and F excluded.

Perhaps ""Z"" but Z absent.

I recall a word: ""ditzy"" was used, and now we need a new guess with the constraints.

Perhaps ""kitty"" is not allowed because duplicate.

Another word: ""MITTS"" is not allowed because duplicate T and S absent.

Wait, the only common word that fits is ""PITY"" but 4 letters? There must be one.

Let's list all English words of form [B J K M P Q U V W X] I T [B J K M P Q U V W X] Y

For example, with M: M I T ? Y

What can the fourth letter be? It has to form a word.

M I T H Y: h absent -> not.

M I T M Y: invalid duplicate if we avoid duplicates? We don't know for sure that there is a duplicate, but we haven't seen any duplicate so far, so we keep that assumption.

Similarly, M I T B Y: is ""MITBY"" a word? No.

M I T J Y: ""MITJY"" no.

Similarly for other starting letters.

With B: B I T B Y? ""BITBY"" not a word.

B I T J Y no.

With P: P I T B Y: ""PITBY"" not a word.

P I T P Y: duplicate.

P I T K Y: ""PITKY"" not a word.

With K: K I T K Y: duplicate.

K I T M Y: ""KITMY"" not.

With W: W I T B Y: ""WITBY"" not.

W I T M Y: ""WITMY"" not.

With U: U I T B Y: ""UITBY"" not.

Etc.

Perhaps ""BITTY"" is 5-letter: B-I-T-T-Y, but two T's -> not allowed.

The word ""pithy"" came to mind again, but H is excluded.

Another word: ""dirty"" D and R excluded.

""misty"" M-I-S-T-Y: S excluded.

""cattily"" too long.

Perhaps ""testy"" T at the beginning? Not pattern.

We must have T at position 3.

Maybe ""latin"" not.

Wait, perhaps ""METY"" not.

I think we have a limited pool.

Another uncommon word: ""vitry"" not English.

Perhaps ""brit"" is shorter.

Or ""witty"" has duplicate T.

Given the constraints, perhaps we missed a letter. Available letters include U, so ""QUIET"" not, but ""QUITE"" E excluded.

""QUINT"" N excluded.

""QUIT"" 4 letters.

""QUIM"" not helpful.

Perhaps The word is ""PITHY"" is not allowed.

But in the feedback, we already have excluded letters.

Another idea: what if there is a duplicate letter? But we haven't seen any, so we keep the no-duplicate assumption.

Perhaps ""BUTTY"" B-U-T-T-Y, but U and duplicate T, and also T at position 3? ""BUTTY"" is B-U-T-T-Y -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:T,4:T,5:Y -> two T's, so invalid.

 similarly.

Perhaps ""kithe"" not 5 and not.

After reevaluating feedback, we see that in Guess 4, we have Y at position 5 is correct. And we have I at 2 and T at 3 correct.

So the word is for sure * I T * Y.

Now, letters not excluded: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X.

For the fourth letter (position 4), it must be one of these, and it forms the word.

For example, ""MITY"" is not a word, but with a first letter: e.g., ""EMITY"" E excluded and no.

""AMITY"" A excluded.

""        "" 

Perhaps ""PIXY"" not, but """"PIXTY"" not a word.

But there is ""PIETY"" but E excluded and position 3 is E, not T? ""PIETY"" is P-I-E-T-Y -> position 3 is E, not T. But we need position 3 to be T, so it doesn't match.

Similarly, ""DUTY"" D excluded and shorter.

I think the only possibility is that our assumption of no duplicates is wrong, or we missed a word.

Let's think of words ending in ""ITY"": like ""CITY"" -> 4.

""MOBILITY"" too long.

""MAJESTY"" not matching pattern.

""BAY   "" not.

Another idea: ""BITTY"" might be accepted as a word? But it has two T's, and we haven't encountered a duplicate, but it's possible.

In Guess 4, ""ditzy"" has D,I,T,Z,Y — all distinct.

No indication of duplicates.

But perhaps in the secret word, there is a duplicate? Unlikely at this stage.

Perhaps Z is not excluded yet? No, in Guess 4, Z(x), so absent.

Let's list again the available letters: B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X.

Now, possible words:
- ""JUICY"" but C excluded and U-I-C-Y -> not.
- ""BUMPY"" M and P, but positions: B-U-M-P-Y -> not I at position 2 and T at 3.
- ""Jumpy"" J-U-M-P-Y -> no I and T at 2 and 3.

We need the second letter to be I, third to be T.

So must be: first letter and fourth letter from the list.

Common words I can find are rare, but one word: ""TIGHT"" T at position 1 and G and H absent.

Not.

""LIGHT"" L and G,H absent.

Another word: ""NIGHT"" N and H absent.

Perhaps ""fight"" was used, and G,H absent.

The only word I can think of is ""mity"" not, or "" bit my"" not.

Perhaps ""MID DY"" not.

We have to consider that position 4 might be U or something.

For example, ""U"" as fourth letter: ""? I T U Y""

English words: ""SITUY"" no. ""PITUY"" no.

Except for ""bitus"" not.

Perhaps ""VITUS"" not valid.

It's possible that the word is ""MITIS"" but S excluded and ""Mitis"" may not be common.

But let's look for an answer: perhaps ""PITHY"" is not the only option, but H is excluded.

I recall that in the feedback, we have I and T and Y fixed.

So the word must be like XITY, but 4 letters, or something 5.

Another word: ""BATTY"" has A and double T? B-A-T-T-Y -> A excluded and two T's.

 not.

""DITTO"" O excluded.

""TINTY"" T at position 1 and N excluded.

After research, I think ""WITTY"" is the only common word, but it has two T's.

Perhaps in this game, ""WITTY"" could be used, but we have not seen any duplicate, so it's risky.

Gather the known correct letters: positions 2,3,5: I, T, Y.

And we have to fill position 1 and 4.

Position 4 must be a letter that can form T*Y? But in English, words like: empty, but E excluded.

Ample not.

Perhaps ""Q"" Q I T ? Y? ""QITY"" or ""QUITY"" not words.

Another possibility: ""CITY"" is 4, but ""CITYe"" not.

I think we have to guess with the available letters.

For example, ""PITY"" is 4 letters, so not.

Perhaps ""MIGHT"" but G and H absent, and M-I-G-H-T -> position 3 G, not T.

Not matching.

Let's try ""KIPY"" not.

Perhaps ""JITNEY"" len 6.

I am out of ideas.

Another thought: perhaps the word is ""picky"" but C excluded and no T.

Our known letters require I at 2, T at 3.

So the word is [letter1] I T [letter4] Y

With letters4 from B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X.

The only common word I can now think of is ""PITKY"" but not a word, or ""MITBY"" not.

Perhaps ""W"" I T ""H Y"" with H? But H is excluded.

Wait, there is the word ""WITHY"" W-I-T-H-Y , which means a tough gn willow, and H is in it, but H was guess3 and is absent, so can't be.

But in Guess3, H(x) -> not in word, so cannot.

Similarly, ""PITHY"" not.

Let's double-check excluded letters:
- Guess1: C,R,A,N,E (x)
- Guess2: O,L,S (x), and T and I present
- Guess3: F,G,H (x)
- Guess4: D,Z (x)

So H is excluded.

We must use only the available letters.

Possibly "" B"" I T ""W"" Y -> ""BITWY"" not a word.
"" J"" I T ""M"" Y -> ""JITMY"" not.
"" M"" I T ""V"" Y -> ""MITVY"" not.
"" P"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""PITUY"" not.

 rare word ""quitz"" not.

Perhaps ""UM "" not.

I think we have to choose a word that exists, like ""MITTY"" even if rare, or accept duplication.

But let's look online or think harder.

Another word: ""KICKS"" not.

 perhaps ""bicep"" not.

I recall that ""party"" but A and R excluded.

"" ofالا

Perhaps ""PIXIE"" not matching.

One last idea: ""DITZY"" was used, but the secret word might be ""DIZZY"" but Z is excluded and D excluded, but in feedback for ""ditzy"", Z(x), so not in word, and D(x), so not. ""DIZZY"" has Z and D, both absent.

So not.

Given the difficulty, maybe the word is ""city"" but it's 4 letters, so must be 5.

Unless the puzzle allows plurals? But ""cities"" is 6.

 ""pits"" not.

I think we have to make a guess with the pattern and available letters.

For example, ""M"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""MITYU"" not a word.

Perhaps ""V"" I T ""A"" Y -> A excluded.

""B"" I T ""E"" Y -> E excluded.

""B"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""BITYU"" not.

The only letter left is why not ""U"" - like ""U"" I T ""B"" Y: ""UITYB"" not.

Perhaps the fourth letter is P: ""P"" I T ""P"" Y -> duplicate.

Or ""W"" I T ""W"" Y -> duplicate.

So with 10 available letters, none form a common word.

But there must be a word. We missed ""K"" for the fourth letter: ""K"" I T ""K"" Y -> ""KITKY"" not.

And ""B"" for fourth: ""B"" I T ""B"" Y -> ""BITBY"" not.

Perhaps ""J"" forfirst and ""B"" for fourth: ""J"" I T ""B"" Y -> ""JITBY"" not a word.

Similarly, ""J"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""JITYU"" not.

""P"" I T ""K"" Y -> ""PITKY"" not.

But "" PIT key"" not.

Another common word: ""MINTY"" not matching pattern.

Perhaps ""dirty"" but letters excluded.

 I think one English word is ""pithy"", but H is absent.

Or ""withy"", same thing.

Perhaps ""vughy"" not.

Given the constraints, perhaps the word is ""BITOKY"" not.

Or maybe in Allow, ""JITNEY"" is too long.

I see an error: position 4 is between T and Y, so the word is ? I T ? Y

Letters that can be for position 4: vowels like U, so ""ITUY"" not a syllable.

Perhaps ""ITEM"" not.

Let's search for 5-letter words ending in ""Y"" with third letter ""T"" and second letter ""I"".

For example, in English, we have:
- A little common: ""PITHY"", ""WITHY"", "" DITCHY"" not, ""KITTY"", "" BITTY"", ""WITTY"", "" MITTY"", ""NITTY"", ""PITTY"", ""TITTY"", ""ZITTY"", etc.

Among these, ""PITHY"" and ""WITHY"" have H, which is excluded.
""KITTY"", ""BITTY"", etc., have two T's, so if we allow duplicates, then ""KITTY"" could be, but it has T at position 3 and 4, so duplicate T.

But in the secret word, we know T is at position 3, so if there is another T at position 4, it would be duplicate.

Similarly, "" WITTY"" has T at position 3 and 4.

In Guess 4, we have ""ditzy"" dit zy, so D-I-T-Z-Y. If the secret word had two T's, then in position 4 is Z, which is absent, so we got Z(x), and for T at position 3, we got T(✓), but if there were another T, it would have shown in feedback? Let's review the feedback rules.

The feedback for ""ditzy"":
- D: absent (x)
- I: correct position (✓)
- T: correct position (✓)
- Z: absent (x)
- Y: correct position (✓)

If the secret word had another T, say at position 4, then when we placed Z at position 4, we would have expected a feedback for that position: the letter Y is at position 5 and is correct, but for position 4, we put Z, which is not T, but T is in the word not at that position? If secret has T at position 4, and we put Z, then the feedback for that position is 'x' for Z, and for the T in the word, since we already have one T that is correctly placed (position 3), and if there is another T, it should be marked as present if not correct.

But note: feedback only marks a letter as present (-) if it is in the word but not in that position, and if there are multiple, but in this case, for each guess position, only one symbol.

But in our guess, position 4 is Z and we got 'x', so Z is not in the word. If there were a T at position 4, then for the T overall, we have one T matched at position 3 with ✓, and another T could be elsewhere? But in our guess, we didn't place a T at position 4, so we would have a '-' for the T that is at position 4 only if we placed a T in another position and it got matched? It's complicated.

To simplify, in feedback, for each letter in the guess, it checks the secret word:

- For the T in position 3 of the guess, it matches the T in position 3 of the secret, so it's ✓.
- If there is another T in the secret at position 4, when we place Z at position 4, it will be 'x' because Z not present, and with no additional feedback since we didn't place T for the extra T.

So the feedback does not reveal the presence of duplicate letters in other positions if we don't guess those letters.

But for position 4, we guessed Z and it's 'x', so that position is not T in the secret? Not necessarily: it's 'x' means the secret does not have Z at any position, but the letter in position 4 of the secret could be something else.

If the secret had a T at position 4, then when we place Z at position 4, we get 'x' for not being T or present, but the T at position 4 is not reflected because we didn't put a T there.

In summary, the feedback does not indicate the presence of a letter in a position we didn't guess.

But for the letter T, we are only placing it at position 3, so if there is another T in the secret, we wouldn't know yet.

So it's possible that the secret has a duplicate T.

For example, secret word ""WITTY"" W-I-T-T-Y.

But in ""ditzy"", when we put T at position 3, it got ✓, and for position 4, we put Z (x), so that doesn't reveal the true letter at position 4.

Then position 1 is W, position 4 is T, position 5 is Y.

But ""WITTY"" has I at 2, T at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

Then with available letters, W is available.

Then for position 1, we have W, and position 4 should be T.

But T is already at position 3, so duplicate.

In guess 4, we put D for position 1, which is not W, so x.

So secret could be ""WITTY"" and it uses letters W, I, T, T, Y.

But feedback for Guess 4: for position 1, D (x) -> correct.
 position 2: I (✓)
 position 3: T (✓)
 position 4: Z (x) -> correct.
 position 5: Y (✓)

So it's compatible, but not revealed duplicate.

Similarly, ""KITTY"" K-I-T-T-Y, with K as position 1.

Or ""BITTY"" B-I-T-T-Y.

 etc.

So perhaps we should guess a word that has T at position 4 to test or accept duplicates.

Since we have positions 2,3,5 known, we for the fourth guess, we have to guess position 1 and 4.

To test, we can guess a word that has position 1 and 4 filled.

For example, ""W"" for position 1 and ""T"" for position 4: ""W I T T Y"", אבל this has two T's and we are guessing T at position 4, which might give - if not correct, or ✓ if correct.

But if the secret has T at position 4, we get T(✓), otherwise, etc.

Since we have only one guess left for positions let's say, but we have two guesses left overall.

We are at guess 4 feedback, so next is guess 5.

So for the fifth guess, we can try ""WITTY"" to test.

If it is, we win.

If not, etc.

Or ""KITTY"" etc.

But let's choose ""WITTY"" as a common word.

So guess: ""WITTY""

Then we will see.

 another common one is ""KITTY"".

But ""W"" is available.

So ""WITTY"" is W-I-T-T-Y.

We know I at 2, T at 3, Y at 5 will be correct, so feedback will show:
- W: position 1 -> ""W"" in secret? If yes, ✓ or -
- T: position 4 -> if T, then ✓, else if present, - or x.

But we already know T is present, so for position 4, if T, ✓, else - if present but wrong position? But if not, x.

In ""WITTY"", we put duplicate T, so the T at position 4 may be 'x' if not present? No, since T is in the word, if it's not in position 4, we get - if there is another occurrence to match? Feedback rules: each guess letter is evaluated; if the letter is in the word, but that position is wrong, we get -.

For the second T at position 4 in ""WITTY"", if the secret has a T at position 4, we get ✓ for that T. If not, we get - if there is another T position (which there isn't because position 3 is T, but it's already used), it might not get - because we already matched the T.

It's messy.

 the standard way: in feedback, for each letter in guess, it checks against the secret.

- Position 1: W. If the secret's position 1 is W, then ✓. Otherwise, if W is in the secret but not at position 1, then -.
- Position 2: I. Will be ✓.
- Position 3: T. Will be ✓.
- Position 4: T. If secret position 4 is T, then ✓. Otherwise, if there is another T not yet matched, then -.
- Position 5: Y. Will be ✓.

The secret has at least two T's. If not, feedback for position 4 will be x for the second T in the guess letter.

If the secret has exactly one T, then the T at position 4 will be x.

But in this case, for ""ditzy"", we had T at position 3 and got only one 'T' in feedback? We got T(✓) for position 3, and no indication of position 4 because we didn't put T there.

But it's possible that there is another T in position 4.

So to discredit, we can assume no duplicate and keep looking, or guess a word that assumes no duplicate.

Another possibility: ""JIVEY"" not.

I think we have to guess ""WITTY"" or similar.

Or ""PITAY"" not.

Perhaps the letter is U as in ""DUTY"" excluded.

Let's list all existing words that match the pattern.

From an English dictionary, words like:
- ""pithy""
- ""withy""
- ""ditty"" ( duplicate T? ""DITTY"" is D-I-T-T-Y -> two T's)
- ""kitty""
- "" bitty""

All these either have duplicate T or exclude letters.

Other words: "" city"" only 4.

So for the sake ofゲーム, we guess ""WITTY"".

<guess>WITTY</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Previous Feedback Analysis**:
   - **Guess 1: crane → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**:
     - Letters C, R, A, N, E are absent → Excluded: A, C, E, N, R.
   - **Guess 2: toils → FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)**:
     - T is present but not in position 1.
     - I is present but not in position 3.
     - O, L, S are absent → Excluded: L, O, S.
   - **Guess 3: fight → FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)**:
     - I is in position 2 (fixed).
     - T is present but not in position 5.
     - F, G, H are absent → Excluded: F, G, H.
   - **Guess 4: ditzy → FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) T(✓) Z(x) Y(✓)**:
     - I is in position 2 (confirmed).
     - T is in position 3 (fixed).
     - Y is in position 5 (fixed).
     - D and Z are absent → Excluded: D, Z.

2. **Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 2: I
     - Position 3: T
     - Position 5: Y
   - **Remaining Positions**: Position 1 and position 4 are unknown.
   - **Excluded Letters**: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S, Z (13 letters).
   - **Available Letters**: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X (10 letters).
   - **Word Pattern**: `[position1] I T [position4] Y`.
   - **No Duplicates Assumed**: No duplicate letters indicated in previous feedback.

3. **Word Selection**:
   - Goal: Fill position 1 and 4 with unused letters from the available pool.
   - Constraints:
     - Must be a valid English word.
     - Avoids excluded letters and duplicates.
     - Common words like ""PITHY"" (H excluded), ""WITHY"" (H excluded), ""KITTY"" (duplicate T), or ""BITTY"" (duplicate T) are invalid.
   - Challenge: No common words fit the pattern `[B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X] I T [B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X] Y`.
   - After reviewing:
     - Rare words (e.g., ""DITZY"" was used) are not helpful here.
     - ""WITTY"" is a common word that fits the pattern (W-I-T-T-Y) but introduces a duplicate T.
     - However:
       - Duplicate T is possible since feedback doesn't explicitly deny duplicates (e.g., ""ditzy"" gave T(✓) for only one position).
       - ""WITTY"" tests for a duplicate T scenario:
         - Position 1: W (new letter).
         - Position 4: T (potential duplicate).
         - If correct, W(✓) and T(✓) at position 4 confirms duplicate T.
         - If not, feedback will provide new information (e.g., x or - for T at position 4, revealing its true position).
   - ""WITTY"" uses high-frequency letters and is a strategic guess to resolve ambiguity:
     - W is available and commonly used.
     - Tests for duplicate T.

4. **Strategic Choice**:  
   - Guessing ""WITTY"" maximizes information gain for the final guess by:
     - Potentially confirming the secret word.
     - Revealing the status of position 1 (if W is correct/incorrect) and position 4 (if T is present there).
   - Alternative words like ""KITTY"" or ""BITTY"" are less optimal due to lower letter frequency.",Guess 5: WITTY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are just starting the game. We haven't any feedback yet, so we need to make a strategic first guess.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally 5 distinct letters to maximize information.

 Common starting words in word games include: CRANE, SLATE, ROAST, etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has common letters: C, R, A, N, E
 - All letters are distinct.

 So, I will guess ""CRANE"".I am starting the game with no prior feedback. For an initial guess, selecting a word with common letters maximizes information gain. ""CRANE"" is an optimal choice because it contains five distinct letters including frequent ones (A, E, R) and less common consonants (C, N). This spread helps efficiently reveal positional accuracy for the secret word.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are on the second guess. The first guess was ""crane"" and all letters were marked as 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

 Therefore, we must choose a word that does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 We need to pick a word with 5 new letters. We should aim for common letters that haven't been tried yet.

 Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C,R,A,N,E) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, etc.

 A good starting point might be to use a word with high-frequency letters that we haven't tried.

 Let's consider words like: ""SLIMY"", ""TOUGH"", ""PUDGY"", etc. But we want to maximize coverage of new letters.

 Another popular second guess after eliminating 5 letters is to use another set of common letters.

 Let me think of a word that uses common letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}. For example:

 S, T, L, O, P, I, D, M, H, B, etc.

 I can try ""SPLIT"" but that has I and T which are common. However, let's check if we can get more coverage.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has M, O, I, S, T — all common letters and none of the excluded ones.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.

 Since we have no information, we want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me choose ""MOIST"":

 M, O, I, S, T — all new.

 However, if we are avoiding the letters from the first guess, then yes.

 Another option: ""PUDGY"" — P, U, D, G, Y — but Y is less common.

 Or ""LUCKY"" — but we know C is already out? Yes, C is out.

 Actually, we must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 So, ""MOIST"" is valid.

 But let's consider frequency. According to English letter frequency, after removing C,R,A,N,E, the next most common are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, H, etc.

 We can try to cover S, T, L, O, I.

 The word ""TOILS"" or ""SOILT"" — but ""SOILT"" is not a word. ""SLOTH"" is a word: S, L, O, T, H — that covers 5 new letters including H.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T.

 But I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T — which are all high frequency.

 However, note that we are in the second guess and we have 5 new letters. We want to maximize the chance of getting hits.

 Let me check: the most common letters in 5-letter words (without C,R,A,N,E) are:

 According to various sources, the top letters are: E, A, R, O, T, I, S, N, etc. but we have excluded E,A,R,N. So the next are O, T, I, S, L, C (but C is out), so O, T, I, S, L.

 So a word with O, T, I, S, L would be ideal. But we can't have all in one word? Let's see:

 Words: ""TOILS"" (T, O, I, L, S) — that's 5 letters. Is ""TOILS"" a valid word? Yes, it is (plural of toil? or third person present of toil? but in word games, it's accepted).

 Alternatively, ""SLOTH"" (S, L, O, T, H) — H is less common.

 Or ""POINT"" — but P is not as common as S or T? and we have O, I, N (but N is excluded) — wait, N is excluded, so we cannot use N.

 So ""POINT"" has N which is excluded.

 Therefore, ""TOILS"" is a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S.

 But let me confirm: T, O, I, L, S — none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}. So it's valid.

 Another option: ""BUOYS"" — B, U, O, Y, S — but Y and U are less common.

 I think ""TOILS"" is a strong choice.

 However, note that we are only on the second guess and we have 4 more after this. We can also consider words that have more vowels? We have O and I (vowels) in ""TOILS"", and we already tried A and E and they are not in the word, so the vowels left are O, I, U. We have O and I in ""TOILS"".

 Alternatively, we could use ""OUPHS"" — but that's obscure.

 I think ""TOILS"" is acceptable.

 But let me see if there's a word that includes U as well? We have to cover 5 letters, so we can't cover everything.

 We can stick with ""TOILS"".

 However, to be safe, I'll choose ""MOIST"" because it's a common word and we get M as well, which is a common consonant.

 But note: M is less common than L? Actually, L is the 12th most common letter in English, M is 14th, so L is slightly more common. But in ""TOILS"" we have L and in ""MOIST"" we have M.

 Since we have no information, either is fine.

 I'll go with ""TOILS"" because it uses the top letters we have available: S, T, L, O, I.

 So, my second guess is ""TOILS"".After the first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters (C, R, A, N, E) being marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. The new guess must avoid these letters and prioritize high-frequency English letters not yet tested. Common remaining letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, and H. 

The word ""TOILS"" is chosen because:
- It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters: T, O, I, L, S.
- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.
- It covers common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S), increasing the chance of hits.

This guess will help identify which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.

- O is not in the word.
- I is in the word but not in the correct position (third position).
- L is not in the word.
- S is not in the word.

So, letters that are in the secret word: T and I (but not in positions 1 and 3 respectively).
Letters not in the word: O, L, S (and from guess 1: C, R, A, N, E).

Therefore, the set of excluded letters is: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.

Available letters: all others except these.

We know:
- The word contains T and I. T is not in position 1, I is not in position 3.
- Since T and I are present, and the word is 5 letters.

Also, note that in ""toils"", T was in position 1 and I in position 3, but those positions are wrong for these letters. So T must be in positions 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions 2, 4, or 5? The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

But T cannot be in position 1 (as in the guess). Similarly, I cannot be in position 3.

Now, T is present but not in position 1, and I is present but not in position 3.

We need to form a guess that:
- Does not use any excluded letters: so avoid C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.
- Must include T and I (since we know they are in the word, we should reuse them to find their positions).
- And we should try to include new letters to gain more information.

But note: we don't have to include T and I in every guess? Actually, no, we can guess without them, but since we know they are in the word, it's efficient to place them in positions we haven't tested to narrow down.

Moreover, we have 3 letters unknown: since T and I are already present, there are 3 other letters in the word to discover.

Now, what positions are available for T? It can be in 2, 3, 4, or 5? But we don't know about position 2 yet. In the second guess, T was in position 1, so position 1 is wrong. But that doesn't tell us about other positions. So T must appear in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? And similarly, I must appear in position 1,2,4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong).

But note: we don't know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But we haven't seen any indication, so we'll assume no duplicates for now.

Let's list the available letters: excluding C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S, we have:
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: we know I and T are in the word, so they can be reused? But we don't yet know about others.

Now, we want to form a word that includes T and I, and three new letters to test.

We also know that T cannot be in position 1 (from the first letter of guess 2), and I cannot be in position 3.

In our new guess, we can try placing T in a different position to see if we get a ✓ or a -.

Similarly for I.

A good strategy: place T in position 2 or 4? Since position 1 is excluded for T, and in the second guess we didn't test T in position 2.

Similarly, for I: avoid position 3, so try in position 1,2,4, or 5.

But we also need to pick three new letters.

Let me think of common words that fit.

We can aim for a word that has T and I and three common letters: like D, H, M, P, etc.

For example, pick letters: D, H, M, along with T and I.

Then form a word: possible words?
- Must be 5 letters, and avoid C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S.

Possible word: ""THUMB""? But U is available? ""THUMB"" has T,H,U,M,B. But we need to include I? Oh, I forgot we must include I.

So we need a word that has T, I, and three other new letters.

Let me try: ""MIGHT"" -> M,I,G,H,T. However, that has I in position 2 and T in position 5.

But position 3? We put G there.

Available letters: we haven't excluded B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

""might"" is M-I-G-H-T.

But note: we know I cannot be in position 3? Actually, in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but in our guess, we can put I anywhere? We are testing new positions.

In this guess, we can put I in position 2? That's allowed because we haven't tested I in position 2.

Similarly, T in position 5.

But we aren't sure what positions they are in.

Another word: ""PITHY"" -> P,I,T,H,Y. But that has I in position 2 and T in position 3? We want to avoid putting I in position 3? Actually, no, we are guessing — we can put I in position 3? The feedback will tell us if it's correct or not.

However, we know from previous feedback that the secret word's I is not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will get an x for sure? Actually, no: because we already know I is not in position 3? So we'd get a - if it were present but in wrong position, but we put it in the wrong position? It might be inefficient.

But note the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, we get ✓. Otherwise, if it's in the word but wrong position, we get -.

We know I is in the word, but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will never get ✓, only - or x? Actually, since we know it's not position 3, if we put it there, it should give us - (because it is in the word but wrong position). So we wouldn't learn much except that it's not there, which we already know.

Similarly for T: we know it's not in position 1.

To avoid redundant information, we should avoid putting T in position 1 and I in position 3.

Therefore, in our new guess, place T in positions 2,3,4,5 but not 1. And I in positions 1,2,4,5 but not 3.

Let me think of a word that meets these conditions.

Also, we want to use common letters not yet tested.

So: for example, T in position 2: then ? T ? ? ?

Or T in position 4: then ? ? ? T ?

Similarly for I.

One idea: put I in position 1 and T in position 4? Or to maximize information, put them in positions that we haven't ruled out.

Try: I in position 1, T in position 5, and then three new letters.

So: I _ _ _ T

What words? Like ""INPUT"" but N and P? N is excluded (from guess 1: N is not in word).

N is excluded, so not available.

""QUIET"" but Q and U? Also, E is excluded.

Avoid E.

""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T. That works: F, I, G, H, T.
- Positions: I in position 2? ""FIGHT"" is F-I-G-H-T, so I is in position 2, T in position 5.

That works.

Also, ""FIGHT"" uses F which is new, G, H, T, I.

T is reused, I is reused.

Also, positions: I is in position 2 (we haven't tested I in position 2), T in position 5 (we haven't tested T in position 5).

Moreover, we haven't tested F, G, H.

So this seems good.

Another word: ""MIGHT"" as before: M,I,G,H,T. Same positions.

But ""FIGHT"" is valid.

Is there a word with T in position 2? Like ""BOTHY"" but O is excluded and we need I? Doesn't work.

""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> positions: P in 1, I in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5.
But we have T in position 3? We haven't tested T in position 3.

And I in position 2? Also fine.

But note: we know I is present and T is present, so both are in the word.

In ""PITHY"", if we put T in position 3, that might be acceptable because we haven't tested that position for T.

But we must avoid I in position 3? Not necessary for the guess? We can put T in position 3? But we don't know if T is in position 3? It could be.

But note: in the feedback rule, if it is in the correct position, we get ✓.

So it's acceptable.

However, comparing ""FIGHT"" and ""PITHY"", both cover similar letters.

But ""FIGHT"" tests F, which might be less common? Actually, H is common.

Also, in ""PITHY"", we have Y which is less common.

So ""FIGHT"" might be better.

Another word: ""WIGHT"" (a mythical being) - but rare? Avoid rare words? We want common words.

""FIGHT"" is common.

Alternatively, ""DIGHT""? Not common.

""TIGHT"" - but T in position 1: but we cannot have T in position 1! Because we know T is not in the correct position if placed first? Actually, we already got - for T in position 1, meaning it's present but not in first position. But we can put T in the first position? We would get a - again? Because we already know it's not first position.

But that would be inefficient: if we put T in position 1, we know it will be - for sure.

Similarly, avoid that.

So ""TIGHT"" starts with T -> position 1: T, but we know T isn't in position 1, so it would be - or x? Present but wrong position -> so we'd get -, which we already know. So wasteful.

Therefore, avoid placing T in position 1 and I in position 3.

Back to ""FIGHT"": letters F,I,G,H,T.

Positions: 
1: F (new)
2: I (we haven't tested position 2 for I)
3: G (new)
4: H (new)
5: T (we haven't tested position 5 for T)

This tests I in position 2 and T in position 5, which were not tested before.

We might get hits.

Another possibility: ""PUPIL"" but U is not very common? and L is excluded. Wait, L is excluded? From guess 2: L(x) -> not in word.

So we cannot use L.

""MUMMY"" has duplicate M? Not efficient.

""DUVET"" has D,U,V,E,T? But E is excluded.

So ""FIGHT"" seems good.

But let me check if the word ""FIGHT"" is allowed: yes, it's a standard English word.

Final guess: ""FIGHT"".

However, note: from feedback we have T(-) meaning T is in the word but not in first position. We haven't tested T in position 5, so we do that.

Similarly for I: in guess 2, I was in position 3 and got -, meaning it's in the word but not in position 3. Now we try it in position 2.

We also test F, G, H.

This maximizes new information.

So let's go with that.From the feedback:
- In Guess 1 (""crane""), all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are excluded.
- In Guess 2 (""toils""), T is present but in the wrong position (-), O is absent (x), I is present but in the wrong position (-), L is absent (x), and S is absent (x). This means O, L, and S are excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.  
Confirmed present letters: T and I, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.

The new guess must include T and I (to locate their correct positions) and avoid excluded letters. T cannot be placed in position 1, and I cannot be placed in position 3. To maximize information gain, I placed I in position 2 (untested) and T in position 5 (untested), while introducing three new common letters: F, G, H.

The word ""FIGHT"" meets these criteria:  
- Positions: F (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5).  
- Avoids excluded letters and reuses T and I in new positions.  
- Tests F, G, and H for the first time.

<guess>fight</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)
Guess 3: fight -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
Guess 2: ""toils"" -> 
  T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, not at position 1)
  O: absent
  I: present but wrong position (so I is in the word, not at position 3)
  L: absent
  S: absent
Thus, O, L, S are also absent.

Guess 3: ""fight"" ->
  F: absent
  I: correct position (so I is in the word and at position 2)
  G: absent
  H: absent
  T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)

Now, we know:
- I is in the word and is in position 2. (from guess 3: I(✓) at position 2)
- T is in the word, but not at position 1 (from guess 2) and not at position 5 (from guess 3). So T must be in position 3 or 4? (since position 1 and 5 are ruled out, and position 2 is taken by I, so only 3 or 4 left for T? But wait, the word has positions 1,2,3,4,5. Position 2 is I, so T cannot be there. So T must be in position 3 or 4.

But note: in guess 3, we had T at position 5 and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but not at 5. We also know from guess 2 that T is not at position 1. And position 2 is now taken by I, so T must be in position 3 or 4.

Also, we have the following letters absent: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S, F, G, H.

So the absent letters are: A, C, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S.

Now, the word must contain I at position 2 and T in either position 3 or 4, and two other letters that we haven't tried yet.

We have used 11 letters that are absent, so the remaining letters are: B, D, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. But note that I and T are already in the word, so we are looking for the other three letters? Actually, the word has 5 letters: we have I at position 2, T at either 3 or 4, and then three other positions: 1, and then either 4 and 5 or 3 and 5? Let me clarify:

The positions:
- Position 2: I (fixed)
- T must be in position 3 or 4.

Case 1: T in position 3.
Then the word is: _ I T _ _

Case 2: T in position 4.
Then the word is: _ I _ T _

We need to fill the blanks with letters from the available set, excluding the absent ones.

Available letters: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. (and T and I are already used, but we can use them again? But we assume no duplicates? Since we haven't seen any duplicates so far, and it's common in Wordle, we assume no duplicates. So each letter only once.)

Therefore, we cannot use T or I again. So the other letters must be from: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a valid English word.

Also, we have two cases for T's position.

We should make a guess that helps us distinguish between these cases and also tests new letters.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess.

We can try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Common letters left: B, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.

We can try a word that has T in position 3 or 4? But we don't know which, so we might want to test one of the cases.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven't tested? But we have tested T in position 1 and 5, and we know it's not there. We haven't tested position 3 or 4.

But in our guess, we can place T in position 3 to see if it's correct? Or in position 4.

But we don't know, so we can try one.

We can also try to include other common letters.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern.

First, if T is in position 3: pattern _ I T _ _

Possible words: with available letters: e.g., ""BITTY"" but T repeated? Not allowed? We assume no duplicates. Also, Y is available.

""BITTY"" has two T's, so invalid.

""MITTS"" but S is absent.

""PITTA"" but A is absent.

""KITTY"" again two T's.

""WITTY"" two T's.

Not many common words with _ I T _ _ without the absent letters.

What about ""DITZY""? D,I,T,Z,Y. Z and Y are available.

But ""DITZY"" is a word? Yes, meaning silly or scatterbrained.

But let's see the pattern: D I T Z Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:T, 4:Z, 5:Y.

But we don't know if T is in position 3.

Similarly, for the other case: _ I _ T _

Possible words: e.g., ""PITHY"" but H is absent and we have I in position 2? ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y, but T is in position 3, not 4. We need T in position 4.

So _ I _ T _ : e.g., ""DIXIT"" but X and I? ""DIXIT"" is D-I-X-I-T, has two I's? Not allowed.

""JIVED"" but E is absent.

""BIDET"" but E absent.

""MINTS"" S absent.

""PINTS"" S absent.

""VISTA"" S and A absent.

This is tricky.

Another idea: ""MINTY"" but N absent? N is absent.

""PUDGY"" but G absent? G is absent from guess 3.

G is absent.

Perhaps we should not fix T in the guess? But we know T is in the word, so we should use it to find the position.

But we have to avoid positions 1 and 5 for T.

So in our guess, we can put T in position 3 or 4.

Let me list possible words that fit one of the patterns and use available letters.

Available: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Pattern 1: _ I T _ _ 

Examples:
- D I T C H -> but C and H absent.
- D I T Z Y -> ""DITZY"" as above.

Pattern 2: _ I _ T _

Examples:
- B I D T E -> E absent.
- M I D T ? 
- P I P T ? 
- W I T T Y -> two T's.

""JUMBO"" but no T? We need to include T.

We must include T because it's in the word.

Another word: ""QUIPT"" but Q and P, and T at the end? But T cannot be at position 5? We know T is not at 5, so if we put T at 5, we get a ""-"" again? But we want to test a new position.

So let's try to put T in position 3 or 4.

How about ""QUITE""? But E absent.

""QUIT"" is 4 letters.

""QUIET"" E absent.

""BUILT"" U,I,L,T but L is absent.

""GUILT"" G and L absent.

""JUICY"" C absent.

This is difficult.

Perhaps we can use a word that has T in position 3 and common letters.

""MITCH"" M,I,T,C,H -> C and H absent.

""BITMAP"" too long.

""PITON"" O absent.

""KITBAG"" A absent.

""WITAN"" A and N absent.

Maybe ""DITZY"" is acceptable.

But let's consider the other case: if we put T in position 4.

Word: _ I _ T _

For example, ""DIETY"" but E absent.

""PIETY"" E absent.

""BIZET"" Z, but E absent and T at the end? Position 5, but we know T is not at 5, so if we put T at 5, we get ""-"" which we already know, so it's wasteful.

In the pattern _ I _ T _, the T is at position 4, so that's fine.

But we need a word.

""JIVET"" J,I,V,E,T -> E absent.

""VIVID"" no T.

""MINIM"" no T.

""PIXIE"" E absent and I repeated.

""WIZUT"" not a word.

""YIETY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""DIZZY"" no T.

I think we need to consider that T might be in position 3, and use ""DITZY"".

Or ""MITZY"" not a word.

Another idea: ""PITKY"" not a word.

Perhaps we missed some letters. Available: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

What about ""MIXUP"" no T.

""QUIPU"" no T.

We must include T.

Let's try to form ""JUDY T"" not.

Perhaps ""DUVET"" but E and V? E absent.

I think we have to go with ""DITZY"" for the pattern with T in position 3.

But let's check if there are other words.

""BITTY"" invalid.

""WITTY"" invalid.

""KITTY"" invalid.

""MITTY"" not common.

""PITTY"" not common.

""TITTY"" not appropriate.

So ""DITZY"" might be the best shot.

But we also have the possibility that T is in position 4.

If we guess ""DITZY"", with T in position 3, then if the word has T in position 3, we might get a hit, else we get a - or x.

But if we get a hit for T, then we know it's position 3.

If we get a - for T, then T must be in position 4.

So it's informative.

Similarly, for the other letters.

So let's go with ""DITZY"".

But is ""DITZY"" a valid word? Yes, it is in some dictionaries.

To be safe, we can choose a more common word.

Another word: ""PITHY"" but H absent and T in position 3? But H is absent.

""WITHY"" W,I,T,H,Y -> H absent.

""KITHY"" not a word.

""ZITHER"" too long.

Perhaps ""DITTO"" but O absent and two T's.

O is absent.

""BIGHT"" G and H absent? In guess 3, G and H are absent.

G and H are absent.

In ""DITZY"", we have D, I, T, Z, Y. Z and Y are not common, but we have to use available letters.

Another common letter: U.

Word with U and T.

For example, ""QUIET"" not.

""BUILT"" L absent.

""DUSTY"" S absent.

""JUDGY"" G absent.

""FUDGY"" F and G absent.

I think ""DITZY"" is acceptable.

But let's see if we can find a word with T in position 4.

For example, ""DIVOT"" O and V? O absent.

""BIGOT"" G and O absent.

""PIVOT"" O absent.

""WIVED"" E absent.

""JIVED"" E absent.

""VIVID"" no T.

""YIVIS"" not a word.

So it's hard.

Perhaps ""MIXED"" E absent.

I think we should go with ""DITZY"".

But there's another word: ""DIZZY"" but no T.

Or ""JAZZY"" no T.

So ""DITZY"" it is.

But in ""DITZY"", we have:
- Position 1: D
- Position 2: I (but we know I is correct at position 2, so it will be ✓)
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: Z
- Position 5: Y

We will get feedback on D, T, Z, Y.

If T is in position 3 in the secret word, we get T(✓), else if T is in position 4, we get T(-) because it's present but not at 3.

And we test D, Z, Y.

So it's informative.

We can also consider ""PZAZZ"" not a word.

So I think ""DITZY"" is the best we can do.

But let's confirm the feedback we expect.

Secret word has I at position 2, T at either 3 or 4, and three other letters from available set.

If we guess ""DITZY"":
- D: could be absent or present? We don't know.
- I: will be ✓ (position 2)
- T: if secret word has T at position 3, then ✓, else if at position 4, then - (because present but not at 3)
- Z: ?
- Y: ?

Then based on feedback, we can proceed.

Another word: ""JITTY"" not common, and T at position 3? J,I,T,T,Y two T's.

Invalid.

""BITTY"" invalid.

So I'll go with ""DITZY"".

But to be more common, what about ""MIXTY"" not a word.

Or ""VITZY"" not.

So ""DITZY"" is acceptable.

Perhaps ""DICKY"" but C and K? C is absent.

C is absent.

So no.

""DIKED"" E absent.

""DIKEY"" not common.

I think we have to use ""DITZY"".

But let's think of a different approach: maybe we don't put I in position 2? But we know I is fixed at position 2, so in our guess, we must have I at position 2 to avoid wasting a position? Because if we put I elsewhere, we know it will be - or x, but since it's fixed at 2, if we put it elsewhere, it will be - (because present but wrong position), which we already know, so it's better to keep it at position 2 to free up other positions for new letters.

In this case, for position 2, we must put I, because it's correct and we can get a ✓, which doesn't cost us information.

So position 2 must be I.

Then for T, we put it in a new position, say 3 or 4.

So ""DITZY"" is fine.

Another word: ""PITZA"" not a word.

""PIZZA"" has Z twice and A absent.

Not.

So I'll guess ""DITZY"".

But let's write it.

<guess>ditzy</guess>

But we have to make sure it's 5 letters.

D-I-T-Z-Y.

Yes.

Perhaps ""WIFTY"" not a word.

So I think that's it.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E.
   - **Guess 2 (""toils"")**: 
     - T is present but wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 1.
     - O, L, S are absent (x). Excluded letters: O, L, S.
     - I is present but wrong position (-), so I is in the word but not at position 3.
   - **Guess 3 (""fight"")**:
     - F, G, H are absent (x). Excluded letters: F, G, H.
     - I is correct position (✓), so I is in the word and fixed at position 2.
     - T is present but wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 5.
   
   **Summary**:
   - Excluded letters (15 total): A, C, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S (from guesses 1-3).
   - Confirmed letters: 
     - I is fixed at position 2 (from ""fight"" ✓).
     - T is present but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""toils"" - at pos 1 and ""fight"" - at pos 5). T must be in position 3 or 4.
   - Remaining letters available (not excluded and not yet used): B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - Since I and T are confirmed, the word has 3 unknown letters from the remaining pool. No duplicates are assumed.

2. **Deduce Word Structure**:
   - Position 2 is fixed as I.
   - T must be in position 3 or 4 (positions 1 and 5 are ruled out for T).
   - Two possible patterns:
     - If T is in position 3: `_ I T _ _`
     - If T is in position 4: `_ I _ T _`
   - The unknown positions (1, 3/4, and 5) must be filled with letters from the available set (B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Prioritize testing T's position to resolve ambiguity (position 3 vs. 4) while introducing new high-frequency letters.
   - Place T in position 3 to test if it is correct (if not, T must be in position 4).
   - Fill other positions with common unused letters (e.g., D, Y, Z) to maximize information.
   - Avoid redundant placements (e.g., I is fixed at position 2, so no need to test elsewhere; T should not be placed in positions 1 or 5).

4. **Word Selection**:
   - Target pattern: `_ I T _ _` (to test T in position 3).
   - Possible words: ""DITZY"" fits the pattern and uses available letters (D, Z, Y are new and relatively common).
     - D in position 1 (new).
     - I in position 2 (fixed, will be ✓).
     - T in position 3 (testing for correctness).
     - Z in position 4 (new).
     - Y in position 5 (new).
   - ""DITZY"" is a valid English word (meaning silly or scatterbrained) and tests:
     - Whether T is in position 3 (✓ or -).
     - Presence of D, Z, Y (which could be in the word or absent).

5. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If T is in position 3: Feedback will show T(✓), confirming T's position.
   - If T is not in position 3: Feedback will show T(-), confirming T must be in position 4.
   - Feedback on D, Z, Y will reveal if any are present, narrowing possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>ditzy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)
Guess 3: fight -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)
Guess 4: ditzy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) T(✓) Z(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""ditzy"" -> D(x) I(✓) T(✓) Z(x) Y(✓)
This means:
- D: absent (so D is not in the word)
- I: correct and in position 2
- T: correct and in position 3
- Z: absent
- Y: correct and in position 5

So now we know:
- Position 2: I
- Position 3: T
- Position 5: Y
- Therefore, the word is _ I T _ Y

Also, we have the following letters excluded (from previous feedback):
- From Guess 1: C, R, A, N, E (all absent)
- From Guess 2: O, L, S (absent) and note T and I are present (but we now know their positions)
- From Guess 3: F, G, H (absent)
- From Guess 4: D, Z (absent)

So excluded letters: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S, Z (13 letters)

Available letters: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X

Now, the secret word is _ I T _ Y, and we need to fill the first and fourth positions with two letters from the available set, without duplicates (since all letters so far are distinct).

We must find a valid English word of the form [letter1] I T [letter2] Y.

Now, we test letter1 and letter2 from the available pool.

Common possibilities: we need words ending with ""ITY"", but with a letter in between? Actually, it's I T [letter2] Y, so the ending is ""T?Y"".

Pattern: * I T * Y

Let's think of common words:
- ""PITY"" but that's 4 letters. We need 5.
- ""MITY""? Not common.
- ""CITY"" but C is excluded.
- ""KITTY"" has two T's and T is already in position 3? Also, K and Y: but we have position 1 and 4. ""KITTY"" is K-I-T-T-Y -> two T's so invalid because we assumed no duplicates.

Actually, we must avoid duplicates because we haven't seen any duplicate letters so far.

Possible words:
- ""B"" as first letter: ""BITY? What? ""B"" I T * Y -> e.g., ""BITTY"" has two T's -> invalid.
- ""M"" as first: ""MITY""? ""MITY"" is not a word. ""MISTY"" but S excluded and position 4 is T? No, position 4 must be empty.

Specifically, the word must be 5 letters: first letter, then I, T, fourth letter, Y.

So: ? I T ? Y

Common words: 
- ""PITHY"" but H and we have I? But ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y -> H is excluded (from guess 3: H absent). So not.
- ""WITTY"" has two T's -> invalid.
- ""DITTY"" D excluded and two T's -> no.

Available letters: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X.

Try P: ""PIT*Y"" -> possibilities: ""PITAY""? A excluded. ""PITEY""? E excluded. ""PITY"" is 4 letters. Not.

With M: ""MITY""? Not a word. ""MISTY"" S excluded.

J: ""J"" I T ? Y -> ""JITNY""? N excluded. ""JITHY""? H excluded. No common word.

K: ""K"" I T ? Y -> ""KITTY"" invalid duplicate. ""KITHY""? H excluded. ""KITSY""? S excluded.

Q: ""Q"" I T ? Y -> ""QIT"" not a word.

U: ""U"" I T ? Y -> ""UIT"" not. ""UNIT"" E? ""UNITY"" -> U-N-I-T-Y? But N is excluded. And positions: if ""UNITY"", it would be U(1), N(2) but we need I at position 2. Conflict.

V: ""V"" I T ? Y -> ""VIT*Y"". ""VITAY""? A excluded. ""VITY"" not 5 letters.

W: ""W"" I T ? Y -> ""WITTY"" duplicate. ""WITLY""? L excluded. ""WINDY"" N excluded and D excluded. ""WILLY"" L excluded and duplicate L? Not.

X: ""X"" I T ? Y -> ""XITY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""MINTY"" but N excluded and M-I-N-T-Y -> but position 2 should be I, so ""MINTY"" has M(1), I(2), but then N(3) but we need T at position 3. Conflict.

Wait, we have position 3 fixed as T. So the word is [letter1] I T [letter4] Y.

So ""M"" I T ""?"" Y: e.g., ""MITTY"" which is not common and has two T's? Not allowed.

Another idea: ""PITY"" extended? No.

Perhaps I missed a letter: U. ""U"" I T ? Y: ""UITWY"" no.

But note: available letters include B, so ""B"" I T ? Y -> ""BITBY""? No. ""BITSY""? S excluded.

Now, real English words: 
- ""BIGLY"" G and L excluded? Not.

Possible words: 
- ""PIETY"": P-I-E-T-Y -> but E is excluded, and T is in position 4? Wait, ""PIETY"" is P-I-E-T-Y -> positions: P1, I2, E3, T4, Y5? But we need T at position 3. So position 3 is E, but we need it as T. So conflict.

In ""PIETY"", T is at position 4, which would be our fourth slot? So pattern: P-I-E-T-Y? But in our case, position 3 must be T, so it can't be E. Therefore, not matching.

We need a word where after I is T. So the third letter is T.

For example, ""CITY"" is C-I-T-Y? That's 4 letters. We need 5 letters.

The word ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y -> that's 5 letters: positions 1:P, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:Y. However, H is excluded (from Guess 3: H absent). So not.

Similarly, ""WITHY"" W-I-T-H-Y -> H absent.

""KITTY"" K-I-T-T-Y -> two T's -> not allowed.

""BATTY"" -> A and two T's? A excluded.

""MITT"" is 4 letters.

Perhaps ""DITTY"" -> D and two T's? D excluded.

But we have excluded so many letters.

Another possibility: ""POTTY"" O excluded and two T's.

We must find a word with the correct pattern and using only available letters.

Available: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X

Now, let's try ""MITBY"" not a word.

""BITMY"" not.

"" JIT "" not.

Perhaps ""VITAY"" not.

Wait, one word: ""PIXIE"" -> P-I-X-I-E -> but two I's? And E excluded. Not.

Another word: ""MIXUP"" U and P -> M-I-X-U-P -> positions: M1, I2, X3, U4, P5? But we need T at position 3? Here it is X. So unless X is T? No, T is required.

The only word I can think of is ""MISTY"" but S excluded.

Wait, perhaps ""WIGHT"" -> W-I-G-H-T -> but G and H absent? Also, T is at the end? But we need T at position 3? Here it is position 5: W1,I2,G3,H4,T5? But we need T at 3 and Y at 5? Not matching.

We need Y at position 5.

So words ending in Y with the pattern * I T * Y.

Common words: ""NITRY"" not common? ""NITTY"" N excluded and duplicate T.

""RITZY"" R excluded and Z excluded.

But we haven't used B, M, P, and some others.

Perhaps ""BINTY"" not a word.

""PINTY"" not.

""JUMBY"" J,U,M,B,Y -> but does it fit ""J"" I T ? Y -> no T.

We must have T at position 3.

Think of: city -> 4 letters. 
pity -> 4.

But there is ""PITHY"" which is 5, but H absent.

Another word: ""WIFTY"" not common, and F excluded.

Perhaps ""Z"" but Z absent.

I recall a word: ""ditzy"" was used, and now we need a new guess with the constraints.

Perhaps ""kitty"" is not allowed because duplicate.

Another word: ""MITTS"" is not allowed because duplicate T and S absent.

Wait, the only common word that fits is ""PITY"" but 4 letters? There must be one.

Let's list all English words of form [B J K M P Q U V W X] I T [B J K M P Q U V W X] Y

For example, with M: M I T ? Y

What can the fourth letter be? It has to form a word.

M I T H Y: h absent -> not.

M I T M Y: invalid duplicate if we avoid duplicates? We don't know for sure that there is a duplicate, but we haven't seen any duplicate so far, so we keep that assumption.

Similarly, M I T B Y: is ""MITBY"" a word? No.

M I T J Y: ""MITJY"" no.

Similarly for other starting letters.

With B: B I T B Y? ""BITBY"" not a word.

B I T J Y no.

With P: P I T B Y: ""PITBY"" not a word.

P I T P Y: duplicate.

P I T K Y: ""PITKY"" not a word.

With K: K I T K Y: duplicate.

K I T M Y: ""KITMY"" not.

With W: W I T B Y: ""WITBY"" not.

W I T M Y: ""WITMY"" not.

With U: U I T B Y: ""UITBY"" not.

Etc.

Perhaps ""BITTY"" is 5-letter: B-I-T-T-Y, but two T's -> not allowed.

The word ""pithy"" came to mind again, but H is excluded.

Another word: ""dirty"" D and R excluded.

""misty"" M-I-S-T-Y: S excluded.

""cattily"" too long.

Perhaps ""testy"" T at the beginning? Not pattern.

We must have T at position 3.

Maybe ""latin"" not.

Wait, perhaps ""METY"" not.

I think we have a limited pool.

Another uncommon word: ""vitry"" not English.

Perhaps ""brit"" is shorter.

Or ""witty"" has duplicate T.

Given the constraints, perhaps we missed a letter. Available letters include U, so ""QUIET"" not, but ""QUITE"" E excluded.

""QUINT"" N excluded.

""QUIT"" 4 letters.

""QUIM"" not helpful.

Perhaps The word is ""PITHY"" is not allowed.

But in the feedback, we already have excluded letters.

Another idea: what if there is a duplicate letter? But we haven't seen any, so we keep the no-duplicate assumption.

Perhaps ""BUTTY"" B-U-T-T-Y, but U and duplicate T, and also T at position 3? ""BUTTY"" is B-U-T-T-Y -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:T,4:T,5:Y -> two T's, so invalid.

 similarly.

Perhaps ""kithe"" not 5 and not.

After reevaluating feedback, we see that in Guess 4, we have Y at position 5 is correct. And we have I at 2 and T at 3 correct.

So the word is for sure * I T * Y.

Now, letters not excluded: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X.

For the fourth letter (position 4), it must be one of these, and it forms the word.

For example, ""MITY"" is not a word, but with a first letter: e.g., ""EMITY"" E excluded and no.

""AMITY"" A excluded.

""        "" 

Perhaps ""PIXY"" not, but """"PIXTY"" not a word.

But there is ""PIETY"" but E excluded and position 3 is E, not T? ""PIETY"" is P-I-E-T-Y -> position 3 is E, not T. But we need position 3 to be T, so it doesn't match.

Similarly, ""DUTY"" D excluded and shorter.

I think the only possibility is that our assumption of no duplicates is wrong, or we missed a word.

Let's think of words ending in ""ITY"": like ""CITY"" -> 4.

""MOBILITY"" too long.

""MAJESTY"" not matching pattern.

""BAY   "" not.

Another idea: ""BITTY"" might be accepted as a word? But it has two T's, and we haven't encountered a duplicate, but it's possible.

In Guess 4, ""ditzy"" has D,I,T,Z,Y — all distinct.

No indication of duplicates.

But perhaps in the secret word, there is a duplicate? Unlikely at this stage.

Perhaps Z is not excluded yet? No, in Guess 4, Z(x), so absent.

Let's list again the available letters: B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X.

Now, possible words:
- ""JUICY"" but C excluded and U-I-C-Y -> not.
- ""BUMPY"" M and P, but positions: B-U-M-P-Y -> not I at position 2 and T at 3.
- ""Jumpy"" J-U-M-P-Y -> no I and T at 2 and 3.

We need the second letter to be I, third to be T.

So must be: first letter and fourth letter from the list.

Common words I can find are rare, but one word: ""TIGHT"" T at position 1 and G and H absent.

Not.

""LIGHT"" L and G,H absent.

Another word: ""NIGHT"" N and H absent.

Perhaps ""fight"" was used, and G,H absent.

The only word I can think of is ""mity"" not, or "" bit my"" not.

Perhaps ""MID DY"" not.

We have to consider that position 4 might be U or something.

For example, ""U"" as fourth letter: ""? I T U Y""

English words: ""SITUY"" no. ""PITUY"" no.

Except for ""bitus"" not.

Perhaps ""VITUS"" not valid.

It's possible that the word is ""MITIS"" but S excluded and ""Mitis"" may not be common.

But let's look for an answer: perhaps ""PITHY"" is not the only option, but H is excluded.

I recall that in the feedback, we have I and T and Y fixed.

So the word must be like XITY, but 4 letters, or something 5.

Another word: ""BATTY"" has A and double T? B-A-T-T-Y -> A excluded and two T's.

 not.

""DITTO"" O excluded.

""TINTY"" T at position 1 and N excluded.

After research, I think ""WITTY"" is the only common word, but it has two T's.

Perhaps in this game, ""WITTY"" could be used, but we have not seen any duplicate, so it's risky.

Gather the known correct letters: positions 2,3,5: I, T, Y.

And we have to fill position 1 and 4.

Position 4 must be a letter that can form T*Y? But in English, words like: empty, but E excluded.

Ample not.

Perhaps ""Q"" Q I T ? Y? ""QITY"" or ""QUITY"" not words.

Another possibility: ""CITY"" is 4, but ""CITYe"" not.

I think we have to guess with the available letters.

For example, ""PITY"" is 4 letters, so not.

Perhaps ""MIGHT"" but G and H absent, and M-I-G-H-T -> position 3 G, not T.

Not matching.

Let's try ""KIPY"" not.

Perhaps ""JITNEY"" len 6.

I am out of ideas.

Another thought: perhaps the word is ""picky"" but C excluded and no T.

Our known letters require I at 2, T at 3.

So the word is [letter1] I T [letter4] Y

With letters4 from B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X.

The only common word I can now think of is ""PITKY"" but not a word, or ""MITBY"" not.

Perhaps ""W"" I T ""H Y"" with H? But H is excluded.

Wait, there is the word ""WITHY"" W-I-T-H-Y , which means a tough gn willow, and H is in it, but H was guess3 and is absent, so can't be.

But in Guess3, H(x) -> not in word, so cannot.

Similarly, ""PITHY"" not.

Let's double-check excluded letters:
- Guess1: C,R,A,N,E (x)
- Guess2: O,L,S (x), and T and I present
- Guess3: F,G,H (x)
- Guess4: D,Z (x)

So H is excluded.

We must use only the available letters.

Possibly "" B"" I T ""W"" Y -> ""BITWY"" not a word.
"" J"" I T ""M"" Y -> ""JITMY"" not.
"" M"" I T ""V"" Y -> ""MITVY"" not.
"" P"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""PITUY"" not.

 rare word ""quitz"" not.

Perhaps ""UM "" not.

I think we have to choose a word that exists, like ""MITTY"" even if rare, or accept duplication.

But let's look online or think harder.

Another word: ""KICKS"" not.

 perhaps ""bicep"" not.

I recall that ""party"" but A and R excluded.

"" ofالا

Perhaps ""PIXIE"" not matching.

One last idea: ""DITZY"" was used, but the secret word might be ""DIZZY"" but Z is excluded and D excluded, but in feedback for ""ditzy"", Z(x), so not in word, and D(x), so not. ""DIZZY"" has Z and D, both absent.

So not.

Given the difficulty, maybe the word is ""city"" but it's 4 letters, so must be 5.

Unless the puzzle allows plurals? But ""cities"" is 6.

 ""pits"" not.

I think we have to make a guess with the pattern and available letters.

For example, ""M"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""MITYU"" not a word.

Perhaps ""V"" I T ""A"" Y -> A excluded.

""B"" I T ""E"" Y -> E excluded.

""B"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""BITYU"" not.

The only letter left is why not ""U"" - like ""U"" I T ""B"" Y: ""UITYB"" not.

Perhaps the fourth letter is P: ""P"" I T ""P"" Y -> duplicate.

Or ""W"" I T ""W"" Y -> duplicate.

So with 10 available letters, none form a common word.

But there must be a word. We missed ""K"" for the fourth letter: ""K"" I T ""K"" Y -> ""KITKY"" not.

And ""B"" for fourth: ""B"" I T ""B"" Y -> ""BITBY"" not.

Perhaps ""J"" forfirst and ""B"" for fourth: ""J"" I T ""B"" Y -> ""JITBY"" not a word.

Similarly, ""J"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""JITYU"" not.

""P"" I T ""K"" Y -> ""PITKY"" not.

But "" PIT key"" not.

Another common word: ""MINTY"" not matching pattern.

Perhaps ""dirty"" but letters excluded.

 I think one English word is ""pithy"", but H is absent.

Or ""withy"", same thing.

Perhaps ""vughy"" not.

Given the constraints, perhaps the word is ""BITOKY"" not.

Or maybe in Allow, ""JITNEY"" is too long.

I see an error: position 4 is between T and Y, so the word is ? I T ? Y

Letters that can be for position 4: vowels like U, so ""ITUY"" not a syllable.

Perhaps ""ITEM"" not.

Let's search for 5-letter words ending in ""Y"" with third letter ""T"" and second letter ""I"".

For example, in English, we have:
- A little common: ""PITHY"", ""WITHY"", "" DITCHY"" not, ""KITTY"", "" BITTY"", ""WITTY"", "" MITTY"", ""NITTY"", ""PITTY"", ""TITTY"", ""ZITTY"", etc.

Among these, ""PITHY"" and ""WITHY"" have H, which is excluded.
""KITTY"", ""BITTY"", etc., have two T's, so if we allow duplicates, then ""KITTY"" could be, but it has T at position 3 and 4, so duplicate T.

But in the secret word, we know T is at position 3, so if there is another T at position 4, it would be duplicate.

Similarly, "" WITTY"" has T at position 3 and 4.

In Guess 4, we have ""ditzy"" dit zy, so D-I-T-Z-Y. If the secret word had two T's, then in position 4 is Z, which is absent, so we got Z(x), and for T at position 3, we got T(✓), but if there were another T, it would have shown in feedback? Let's review the feedback rules.

The feedback for ""ditzy"":
- D: absent (x)
- I: correct position (✓)
- T: correct position (✓)
- Z: absent (x)
- Y: correct position (✓)

If the secret word had another T, say at position 4, then when we placed Z at position 4, we would have expected a feedback for that position: the letter Y is at position 5 and is correct, but for position 4, we put Z, which is not T, but T is in the word not at that position? If secret has T at position 4, and we put Z, then the feedback for that position is 'x' for Z, and for the T in the word, since we already have one T that is correctly placed (position 3), and if there is another T, it should be marked as present if not correct.

But note: feedback only marks a letter as present (-) if it is in the word but not in that position, and if there are multiple, but in this case, for each guess position, only one symbol.

But in our guess, position 4 is Z and we got 'x', so Z is not in the word. If there were a T at position 4, then for the T overall, we have one T matched at position 3 with ✓, and another T could be elsewhere? But in our guess, we didn't place a T at position 4, so we would have a '-' for the T that is at position 4 only if we placed a T in another position and it got matched? It's complicated.

To simplify, in feedback, for each letter in the guess, it checks the secret word:

- For the T in position 3 of the guess, it matches the T in position 3 of the secret, so it's ✓.
- If there is another T in the secret at position 4, when we place Z at position 4, it will be 'x' because Z not present, and with no additional feedback since we didn't place T for the extra T.

So the feedback does not reveal the presence of duplicate letters in other positions if we don't guess those letters.

But for position 4, we guessed Z and it's 'x', so that position is not T in the secret? Not necessarily: it's 'x' means the secret does not have Z at any position, but the letter in position 4 of the secret could be something else.

If the secret had a T at position 4, then when we place Z at position 4, we get 'x' for not being T or present, but the T at position 4 is not reflected because we didn't put a T there.

In summary, the feedback does not indicate the presence of a letter in a position we didn't guess.

But for the letter T, we are only placing it at position 3, so if there is another T in the secret, we wouldn't know yet.

So it's possible that the secret has a duplicate T.

For example, secret word ""WITTY"" W-I-T-T-Y.

But in ""ditzy"", when we put T at position 3, it got ✓, and for position 4, we put Z (x), so that doesn't reveal the true letter at position 4.

Then position 1 is W, position 4 is T, position 5 is Y.

But ""WITTY"" has I at 2, T at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.

Then with available letters, W is available.

Then for position 1, we have W, and position 4 should be T.

But T is already at position 3, so duplicate.

In guess 4, we put D for position 1, which is not W, so x.

So secret could be ""WITTY"" and it uses letters W, I, T, T, Y.

But feedback for Guess 4: for position 1, D (x) -> correct.
 position 2: I (✓)
 position 3: T (✓)
 position 4: Z (x) -> correct.
 position 5: Y (✓)

So it's compatible, but not revealed duplicate.

Similarly, ""KITTY"" K-I-T-T-Y, with K as position 1.

Or ""BITTY"" B-I-T-T-Y.

 etc.

So perhaps we should guess a word that has T at position 4 to test or accept duplicates.

Since we have positions 2,3,5 known, we for the fourth guess, we have to guess position 1 and 4.

To test, we can guess a word that has position 1 and 4 filled.

For example, ""W"" for position 1 and ""T"" for position 4: ""W I T T Y"", אבל this has two T's and we are guessing T at position 4, which might give - if not correct, or ✓ if correct.

But if the secret has T at position 4, we get T(✓), otherwise, etc.

Since we have only one guess left for positions let's say, but we have two guesses left overall.

We are at guess 4 feedback, so next is guess 5.

So for the fifth guess, we can try ""WITTY"" to test.

If it is, we win.

If not, etc.

Or ""KITTY"" etc.

But let's choose ""WITTY"" as a common word.

So guess: ""WITTY""

Then we will see.

 another common one is ""KITTY"".

But ""W"" is available.

So ""WITTY"" is W-I-T-T-Y.

We know I at 2, T at 3, Y at 5 will be correct, so feedback will show:
- W: position 1 -> ""W"" in secret? If yes, ✓ or -
- T: position 4 -> if T, then ✓, else if present, - or x.

But we already know T is present, so for position 4, if T, ✓, else - if present but wrong position? But if not, x.

In ""WITTY"", we put duplicate T, so the T at position 4 may be 'x' if not present? No, since T is in the word, if it's not in position 4, we get - if there is another occurrence to match? Feedback rules: each guess letter is evaluated; if the letter is in the word, but that position is wrong, we get -.

For the second T at position 4 in ""WITTY"", if the secret has a T at position 4, we get ✓ for that T. If not, we get - if there is another T position (which there isn't because position 3 is T, but it's already used), it might not get - because we already matched the T.

It's messy.

 the standard way: in feedback, for each letter in guess, it checks against the secret.

- Position 1: W. If the secret's position 1 is W, then ✓. Otherwise, if W is in the secret but not at position 1, then -.
- Position 2: I. Will be ✓.
- Position 3: T. Will be ✓.
- Position 4: T. If secret position 4 is T, then ✓. Otherwise, if there is another T not yet matched, then -.
- Position 5: Y. Will be ✓.

The secret has at least two T's. If not, feedback for position 4 will be x for the second T in the guess letter.

If the secret has exactly one T, then the T at position 4 will be x.

But in this case, for ""ditzy"", we had T at position 3 and got only one 'T' in feedback? We got T(✓) for position 3, and no indication of position 4 because we didn't put T there.

But it's possible that there is another T in position 4.

So to discredit, we can assume no duplicate and keep looking, or guess a word that assumes no duplicate.

Another possibility: ""JIVEY"" not.

I think we have to guess ""WITTY"" or similar.

Or ""PITAY"" not.

Perhaps the letter is U as in ""DUTY"" excluded.

Let's list all existing words that match the pattern.

From an English dictionary, words like:
- ""pithy""
- ""withy""
- ""ditty"" ( duplicate T? ""DITTY"" is D-I-T-T-Y -> two T's)
- ""kitty""
- "" bitty""

All these either have duplicate T or exclude letters.

Other words: "" city"" only 4.

So for the sake ofゲーム, we guess ""WITTY"".

<guess>WITTY</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Previous Feedback Analysis**:
   - **Guess 1: crane → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**:
     - Letters C, R, A, N, E are absent → Excluded: A, C, E, N, R.
   - **Guess 2: toils → FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)**:
     - T is present but not in position 1.
     - I is present but not in position 3.
     - O, L, S are absent → Excluded: L, O, S.
   - **Guess 3: fight → FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)**:

     - T is in position 3 (fixed).
     - Y is in position 5 (fixed).
     - D and Z are absent → Excluded: D, Z.

2. **Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Positions**:
     - Position 2: I
     - Position 3: T
     - Position 5: Y
   - **Remaining Positions**: Position 1 and position 4 are unknown.
   - **Excluded Letters**: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S, Z (13 letters).
   - **Available Letters**: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X (10 letters).
   - **Word Pattern**: `[position1] I T [position4] Y`.
   - **No Duplicates Assumed**: No duplicate letters indicated in previous feedback.

3. **Word Selection**:
   - Goal: Fill position 1 and 4 with unused letters from the available pool.
   - Constraints:
     - Must be a valid English word.
     - Avoids excluded letters and duplicates.
     - Common words like ""PITHY"" (H excluded), ""WITHY"" (H excluded), ""KITTY"" (duplicate T), or ""BITTY"" (duplicate T) are invalid.
   - Challenge: No common words fit the pattern `[B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X] I T [B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X] Y`.
   - After reviewing:
     - Rare words (e.g., ""DITZY"" was used) are not helpful here.
     - ""WITTY"" is a common word that fits the pattern (W-I-T-T-Y) but introduces a duplicate T.
     - However:
       - Duplicate T is possible since feedback doesn't explicitly deny duplicates (e.g., ""ditzy"" gave T(✓) for only one position).
       - ""WITTY"" tests for a duplicate T scenario:
         - Position 1: W (new letter).
         - Position 4: T (potential duplicate).
         - If correct, W(✓) and T(✓) at position 4 confirms duplicate T.
         - If not, feedback will provide new information (e.g., x or - for T at position 4, revealing its true position).
   - ""WITTY"" uses high-frequency letters and is a strategic guess to resolve ambiguity:
     - W is available and commonly used.
     - Tests for duplicate T.

4. **Strategic Choice**:  
   - Guessing ""WITTY"" maximizes information gain for the final guess by:
     - Potentially confirming the secret word.
     - Revealing the status of position 1 (if W is correct/incorrect) and position 4 (if T is present there).
   - Alternative words like ""KITTY"" or ""BITTY"" are less optimal due to lower letter frequency.

The first guess was ""crane"" and all letters were marked as \'x\', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.\n\n Therefore, we must choose a word that does not contain any of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n We need to pick a word with 5 new letters. We should aim for common letters that haven\'t been tried yet.\n\n Common letters in English 5-letter words (excluding C,R,A,N,E) might include: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, H, G, B, etc.\n\n A good starting point might be to use a word with high-frequency letters that we haven\'t tried.\n\n Let\'s consider words like: ""SLIMY"", ""TOUGH"", ""PUDGY"", etc. But we want to maximize coverage of new letters.\n\n Another popular second guess after eliminating 5 letters is to use another set of common letters.\n\n Let me think of a word that uses common letters not in {C, R, A, N, E}. For example:\n\n S, T, L, O, P, I, D, M, H, B, etc.\n\n I can try ""SPLIT"" but that has I and T which are common. However, let\'s check if we can get more coverage.\n\n Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has M, O, I, S, T — all common letters and none of the excluded ones.\n\n But note: we have 6 tries, so we can be systematic.\n\n Since we have no information, we want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\n Let me choose ""MOIST"":\n\n M, O, I, S, T — all new.\n\n However, if we are avoiding the letters from the first guess, then yes.\n\n Another option: ""PUDGY"" — P, U, D, G, Y — but Y is less common.\n\n Or ""LUCKY"" — but we know C is already out? Yes, C is out.\n\n Actually, we must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n So, ""MOIST"" is valid.\n\n But let\'s consider frequency. According to English letter frequency, after removing C,R,A,N,E, the next most common are: S, T, L, O, I, D, M, P, H, etc.\n\n We can try to cover S, T, L, O, I.\n\n The word ""TOILS"" or ""SOILT"" — but ""SOILT"" is not a word. ""SLOTH"" is a word: S, L, O, T, H — that covers 5 new letters including H.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHOUT"": S, H, O, U, T.\n\n But I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has M, O, I, S, T — which are all high frequency.\n\n However, note that we are in the second guess and we have 5 new letters. We want to maximize the chance of getting hits.\n\n Let me check: the most common letters in 5-letter words (without C,R,A,N,E) are:\n\n According to various sources, the top letters are: E, A, R, O, T, I, S, N, etc. but we have excluded E,A,R,N. So the next are O, T, I, S, L, C (but C is out), so O, T, I, S, L.\n\n So a word with O, T, I, S, L would be ideal. But we can\'t have all in one word? Let\'s see:\n\n Words: ""TOILS"" (T, O, I, L, S) — that\'s 5 letters. Is ""TOILS"" a valid word? Yes, it is (plural of toil? or third person present of toil? but in word games, it\'s accepted).\n\n Alternatively, ""SLOTH"" (S, L, O, T, H) — H is less common.\n\n Or ""POINT"" — but P is not as common as S or T? and we have O, I, N (but N is excluded) — wait, N is excluded, so we cannot use N.\n\n So ""POINT"" has N which is excluded.\n\n Therefore, ""TOILS"" is a good candidate: T, O, I, L, S.\n\n But let me confirm: T, O, I, L, S — none of these are in {C, R, A, N, E}. So it\'s valid.\n\n Another option: ""BUOYS"" — B, U, O, Y, S — but Y and U are less common.\n\n I think ""TOILS"" is a strong choice.\n\n However, note that we are only on the second guess and we have 4 more after this. We can also consider words that have more vowels? We have O and I (vowels) in ""TOILS"", and we already tried A and E and they are not in the word, so the vowels left are O, I, U. We have O and I in ""TOILS"".\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""OUPHS"" — but that\'s obscure.\n\n I think ""TOILS"" is acceptable.\n\n But let me see if there\'s a word that includes U as well? We have to cover 5 letters, so we can\'t cover everything.\n\n We can stick with ""TOILS"".\n\n However, to be safe, I\'ll choose ""MOIST"" because it\'s a common word and we get M as well, which is a common consonant.\n\n But note: M is less common than L? Actually, L is the 12th most common letter in English, M is 14th, so L is slightly more common. But in ""TOILS"" we have L and in ""MOIST"" we have M.\n\n Since we have no information, either is fine.\n\n I\'ll go with ""TOILS"" because it uses the top letters we have available: S, T, L, O, I.\n\n So, my second guess is ""TOILS"".After the first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters (C, R, A, N, E) being marked as absent (x), these letters are eliminated from consideration. The new guess must avoid these letters and prioritize high-frequency English letters not yet tested. Common remaining letters include S, T, L, O, I, M, P, and H. \n\nThe word ""TOILS"" is chosen because:\n- It uses 5 new, high-frequency letters: T, O, I, L, S.\n- All letters are distinct, maximizing information gain.\n- It covers common vowels (O, I) and consonants (T, L, S), increasing the chance of hits.\n\nThis guess will help identify which of these letters are present and their positions, narrowing down possibilities for subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>toils</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n1.

T is not in position 1, I is not in position 3.\n- Since T and I are present, and the word is 5 letters.\n\nAlso, note that in ""toils"", T was in position 1 and I in position 3, but those positions are wrong for these letters. So T must be in positions 2, 4, or 5? Actually, positions 2, 4, or 5? The word has positions: 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nBut T cannot be in position 1 (as in the guess). Similarly, I cannot be in position 3.\n\nNow, T is present but not in position 1, and I is present but not in position 3.\n\nWe need to form a guess that:\n- Does not use any excluded letters: so avoid C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.\n- Must include T and I (since we know they are in the word, we should reuse them to find their positions).\n- And we should try to include new letters to gain more information.\n\nBut note: we don\'t have to include T and I in every guess? Actually, no, we can guess without them, but since we know they are in the word, it\'s efficient to place them in positions we haven\'t tested to narrow down.\n\nMoreover, we have 3 letters unknown: since T and I are already present, there are 3 other letters in the word to discover.\n\nNow, what positions are available for T? It can be in 2, 3, 4, or 5? But we don\'t know about position 2 yet. In the second guess, T was in position 1, so position 1 is wrong. But that doesn\'t tell us about other positions. So T must appear in position 2, 3, 4, or 5? And similarly, I must appear in position 1,2,4, or 5 (since position 3 is wrong).\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the secret word has duplicate letters? But we haven\'t seen any indication, so we\'ll assume no duplicates for now.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: excluding C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S, we have:\nB, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: we know I and T are in the word, so they can be reused? But we don\'t yet know about others.\n\nNow, we want to form a word that includes T and I, and three new letters to test.\n\nWe also know that T cannot be in position 1 (from the first letter of guess 2), and I cannot be in position 3.\n\nIn our new guess, we can try placing T in a different position to see if we get a ✓ or a -.\n\nSimilarly for I.\n\nA good strategy: place T in position 2 or 4? Since position 1 is excluded for T, and in the second guess we didn\'t test T in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, for I: avoid position 3, so try in position 1,2,4, or 5.\n\nBut we also need to pick three new letters.\n\nLet me think of common words that fit.\n\nWe can aim for a word that has T and I and three common letters: like D, H, M, P, etc.\n\nFor example, pick letters: D, H, M, along with T and I.\n\nThen form a word: possible words?\n- Must be 5 letters, and avoid C,R,A,N,E,O,L,S.\n\nPossible word: ""THUMB""? But U is available? ""THUMB"" has T,H,U,M,B. But we need to include I? Oh, I forgot we must include I.\n\nSo we need a word that has T, I, and three other new letters.\n\nLet me try: ""MIGHT"" -> M,I,G,H,T. However, that has I in position 2 and T in position 5.\n\nBut position 3? We put G there.\n\nAvailable letters: we haven\'t excluded B,D,F,G,H,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\n""might"" is M-I-G-H-T.\n\nBut note: we know I cannot be in position 3? Actually, in the secret word, I is not in position 3, but in our guess, we can put I anywhere? We are testing new positions.\n\nIn this guess, we can put I in position 2? That\'s allowed because we haven\'t tested I in position 2.\n\nSimilarly, T in position 5.\n\nBut we aren\'t sure what positions they are in.\n\nAnother word: ""PITHY"" -> P,I,T,H,Y. But that has I in position 2 and T in position 3? We want to avoid putting I in position 3? Actually, no, we are guessing — we can put I in position 3? The feedback will tell us if it\'s correct or not.\n\nHowever, we know from previous feedback that the secret word\'s I is not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will get an x for sure? Actually, no: because we already know I is not in position 3? So we\'d get a - if it were present but in wrong position, but we put it in the wrong position? It might be inefficient.\n\nBut note the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word and in the correct position, we get ✓. Otherwise, if it\'s in the word but wrong position, we get -.\n\nWe know I is in the word, but not in position 3. So if we put I in position 3, we will never get ✓, only - or x? Actually, since we know it\'s not position 3, if we put it there, it should give us - (because it is in the word but wrong position). So we wouldn\'t learn much except that it\'s not there, which we already know.\n\nSimilarly for T: we know it\'s not in position 1.\n\nTo avoid redundant information, we should avoid putting T in position 1 and I in position 3.\n\nTherefore, in our new guess, place T in positions 2,3,4,5 but not 1. And I in positions 1,2,4,5 but not 3.\n\nLet me think of a word that meets these conditions.\n\nAlso, we want to use common letters not yet tested.\n\nSo: for example, T in position 2: then ? T ? ? ?\n\nOr T in position 4: then ? ? ? T ?\n\nSimilarly for I.\n\nOne idea: put I in position 1 and T in position 4? Or to maximize information, put them in positions that we haven\'t ruled out.\n\nTry: I in position 1, T in position 5, and then three new letters.\n\nSo: I _ _ _ T\n\nWhat words? Like ""INPUT"" but N and P? N is excluded (from guess 1: N is not in word).\n\nN is excluded, so not available.\n\n""QUIET"" but Q and U? Also, E is excluded.\n\nAvoid E.\n\n""FIGHT"" -> F,I,G,H,T. That works: F, I, G, H, T.\n- Positions: I in position 2? ""FIGHT"" is F-I-G-H-T, so I is in position 2, T in position 5.\n\nThat works.\n\nAlso, ""FIGHT"" uses F which is new, G, H, T, I.\n\nT is reused, I is reused.\n\nAlso, positions: I is in position 2 (we haven\'t tested I in position 2), T in position 5 (we haven\'t tested T in position 5).\n\nMoreover, we haven\'t tested F, G, H.\n\nSo this seems good.\n\nAnother word: ""MIGHT"" as before: M,I,G,H,T. Same positions.\n\nBut ""FIGHT"" is valid.\n\nIs there a word with T in position 2? Like ""BOTHY"" but O is excluded and we need I? Doesn\'t work.\n\n""PITHY"": P,I,T,H,Y -> positions: P in 1, I in 2, T in 3, H in 4, Y in 5.\nBut we have T in position 3? We haven\'t tested T in position 3.\n\nAnd I in position 2? Also fine.\n\nBut note: we know I is present and T is present, so both are in the word.\n\nIn ""PITHY"", if we put T in position 3, that might be acceptable because we haven\'t tested that position for T.\n\nBut we must avoid I in position 3? Not necessary for the guess? We can put T in position 3? But we don\'t know if T is in position 3? It could be.\n\nBut note: in the feedback rule, if it is in the correct position, we get ✓.\n\nSo it\'s acceptable.\n\nHowever, comparing ""FIGHT"" and ""PITHY"", both cover similar letters.\n\nBut ""FIGHT"" tests F, which might be less common? Actually, H is common.\n\nAlso, in ""PITHY"", we have Y which is less common.\n\nSo ""FIGHT"" might be better.\n\nAnother word: ""WIGHT"" (a mythical being) - but rare? Avoid rare words? We want common words.\n\n""FIGHT"" is common.\n\nAlternatively, ""DIGHT""? Not common.\n\n""TIGHT"" - but T in position 1: but we cannot have T in position 1! Because we know T is not in the correct position if placed first? Actually, we already got - for T in position 1, meaning it\'s present but not in first position. But we can put T in the first position? We would get a - again? Because we already know it\'s not first position.\n\nBut that would be inefficient: if we put T in position 1, we know it will be - for sure.\n\nSimilarly, avoid that.\n\nSo ""TIGHT"" starts with T -> position 1: T, but we know T isn\'t in position 1, so it would be - or x? Present but wrong position -> so we\'d get -, which we already know. So wasteful.\n\nTherefore, avoid placing T in position 1 and I in position 3.\n\nBack to ""FIGHT"": letters F,I,G,H,T.\n\nPositions: \n1: F (new)\n2: I (we haven\'t tested position 2 for I)\n3: G (new)\n4: H (new)\n5: T (we haven\'t tested position 5 for T)\n\nThis tests I in position 2 and T in position 5, which were not tested before.\n\nWe might get hits.\n\nAnother possibility: ""PUPIL"" but U is not very common? and L is excluded. Wait, L is excluded? From guess 2: L(x) -> not in word.\n\nSo we cannot use L.\n\n""MUMMY"" has duplicate M? Not efficient.\n\n""DUVET"" has D,U,V,E,T? But E is excluded.\n\nSo ""FIGHT"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if the word ""FIGHT"" is allowed: yes, it\'s a standard English word.\n\nFinal guess: ""FIGHT"".\n\nHowever, note: from feedback we have T(-) meaning T is in the word but not in first position. We haven\'t tested T in position 5, so we do that.\n\nSimilarly for I: in guess 2, I was in position 3 and got -, meaning it\'s in the word but not in position 3. Now we try it in position 2.\n\nWe also test F, G, H.\n\nThis maximizes new information.\n\nSo let\'s go with that.From the feedback:\n- In Guess 1 (""crane""), all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are excluded.\n- In Guess 2 (""toils""), T is present but in the wrong position (-), O is absent (x), I is present but in the wrong position (-), L is absent (x), and S is absent (x). This means O, L, and S are excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, L, S.  \nConfirmed present letters: T and I, but not in positions 1 or 3 respectively.\n\nThe new guess must include T and I (to locate their correct positions) and avoid excluded letters. T cannot be placed in position 1, and I cannot be placed in position 3. To maximize information gain, I placed I in position 2 (untested) and T in position 5 (untested), while introducing three new common letters: F, G, H.\n\nThe word ""FIGHT"" meets these criteria:  \n- Positions: F (1), I (2), G (3), H (4), T (5).  \n- Avoids excluded letters and reuses T and I in new positions.  \n- Tests F, G, and H for the first time.\n\n<guess>fight</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: fight -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.\nGuess 2: ""toils"" -> \n  T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, not at position 1)\n  O: absent\n  I: present but wrong position (so I is in the word, not at position 3)\n  L: absent\n  S: absent\nThus, O, L, S are also absent.\n\nGuess 3: ""fight"" ->\n  F: absent\n  I: correct position (so I is in the word and at position 2)\n  G: absent\n  H: absent\n  T: present but wrong position (so T is in the word, but not at position 5)\n\nNow, we know:\n- I is in the word and is in position 2.

So the other letters must be from: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, we need to form a valid English word.\n\nAlso, we have two cases for T\'s position.\n\nWe should make a guess that helps us distinguish between these cases and also tests new letters.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 guesses left? We are on the fourth guess.\n\nWe can try to cover as many common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters left: B, D, M, P, U, Y, etc.\n\nWe can try a word that has T in position 3 or 4? But we don\'t know which, so we might want to test one of the cases.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has T in a position we haven\'t tested? But we have tested T in position 1 and 5, and we know it\'s not there. We haven\'t tested position 3 or 4.\n\nBut in our guess, we can place T in position 3 to see if it\'s correct? Or in position 4.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so we can try one.\n\nWe can also try to include other common letters.\n\nLet me think of words that fit the pattern.\n\nFirst, if T is in position 3: pattern _ I T _ _\n\nPossible words: with available letters: e.g., ""BITTY"" but T repeated? Not allowed? We assume no duplicates. Also, Y is available.\n\n""BITTY"" has two T\'s, so invalid.\n\n""MITTS"" but S is absent.\n\n""PITTA"" but A is absent.\n\n""KITTY"" again two T\'s.\n\n""WITTY"" two T\'s.\n\nNot many common words with _ I T _ _ without the absent letters.\n\nWhat about ""DITZY""? D,I,T,Z,Y. Z and Y are available.\n\nBut ""DITZY"" is a word? Yes, meaning silly or scatterbrained.\n\nBut let\'s see the pattern: D I T Z Y -> positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:T, 4:Z, 5:Y.\n\nBut we don\'t know if T is in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case: _ I _ T _\n\nPossible words: e.g., ""PITHY"" but H is absent and we have I in position 2? ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y, but T is in position 3, not 4. We need T in position 4.\n\nSo _ I _ T _ : e.g., ""DIXIT"" but X and I? ""DIXIT"" is D-I-X-I-T, has two I\'s? Not allowed.\n\n""JIVED"" but E is absent.\n\n""BIDET"" but E absent.\n\n""MINTS"" S absent.\n\n""PINTS"" S absent.\n\n""VISTA"" S and A absent.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAnother idea: ""MINTY"" but N absent? N is absent.\n\n""PUDGY"" but G absent? G is absent from guess 3.\n\nG is absent.\n\nPerhaps we should not fix T in the guess? But we know T is in the word, so we should use it to find the position.\n\nBut we have to avoid positions 1 and 5 for T.\n\nSo in our guess, we can put T in position 3 or 4.\n\nLet me list possible words that fit one of the patterns and use available letters.\n\nAvailable: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nPattern 1: _ I T _ _ \n\nExamples:\n- D I T C H -> but C and H absent.\n- D I T Z Y -> ""DITZY"" as above.\n\nPattern 2: _ I _ T _\n\nExamples:\n- B I D T E -> E absent.\n- M I D T ? \n- P I P T ? \n- W I T T Y -> two T\'s.\n\n""JUMBO"" but no T? We need to include T.\n\nWe must include T because it\'s in the word.\n\nAnother word: ""QUIPT"" but Q and P, and T at the end? But T cannot be at position 5? We know T is not at 5, so if we put T at 5, we get a ""-"" again? But we want to test a new position.\n\nSo let\'s try to put T in position 3 or 4.\n\nHow about ""QUITE""? But E absent.\n\n""QUIT"" is 4 letters.\n\n""QUIET"" E absent.\n\n""BUILT"" U,I,L,T but L is absent.\n\n""GUILT"" G and L absent.\n\n""JUICY"" C absent.\n\nThis is difficult.\n\nPerhaps we can use a word that has T in position 3 and common letters.\n\n""MITCH"" M,I,T,C,H -> C and H absent.\n\n""BITMAP"" too long.\n\n""PITON"" O absent.\n\n""KITBAG"" A absent.\n\n""WITAN"" A and N absent.\n\nMaybe ""DITZY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s consider the other case: if we put T in position 4.\n\nWord: _ I _ T _\n\nFor example, ""DIETY"" but E absent.\n\n""PIETY"" E absent.\n\n""BIZET"" Z, but E absent and T at the end? Position 5, but we know T is not at 5, so if we put T at 5, we get ""-"" which we already know, so it\'s wasteful.\n\nIn the pattern _ I _ T _, the T is at position 4, so that\'s fine.\n\nBut we need a word.\n\n""JIVET"" J,I,V,E,T -> E absent.\n\n""VIVID"" no T.\n\n""MINIM"" no T.\n\n""PIXIE"" E absent and I repeated.\n\n""WIZUT"" not a word.\n\n""YIETY"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""DIZZY"" no T.\n\nI think we need to consider that T might be in position 3, and use ""DITZY"".\n\nOr ""MITZY"" not a word.\n\nAnother idea: ""PITKY"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps we missed some letters. Available: B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWhat about ""MIXUP"" no T.\n\n""QUIPU"" no T.\n\nWe must include T.\n\nLet\'s try to form ""JUDY T"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""DUVET"" but E and V? E absent.\n\nI think we have to go with ""DITZY"" for the pattern with T in position 3.\n\nBut let\'s check if there are other words.\n\n""BITTY"" invalid.\n\n""WITTY"" invalid.\n\n""KITTY"" invalid.\n\n""MITTY"" not common.\n\n""PITTY"" not common.\n\n""TITTY"" not appropriate.\n\nSo ""DITZY"" might be the best shot.\n\nBut we also have the possibility that T is in position 4.\n\nIf we guess ""DITZY"", with T in position 3, then if the word has T in position 3, we might get a hit, else we get a - or x.\n\nBut if we get a hit for T, then we know it\'s position 3.\n\nIf we get a - for T, then T must be in position 4.\n\nSo it\'s informative.\n\nSimilarly, for the other letters.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""DITZY"".\n\nBut is ""DITZY"" a valid word? Yes, it is in some dictionaries.\n\nTo be safe, we can choose a more common word.\n\nAnother word: ""PITHY"" but H absent and T in position 3? But H is absent.\n\n""WITHY"" W,I,T,H,Y -> H absent.\n\n""KITHY"" not a word.\n\n""ZITHER"" too long.\n\nPerhaps ""DITTO"" but O absent and two T\'s.\n\nO is absent.\n\n""BIGHT"" G and H absent? In guess 3, G and H are absent.\n\nG and H are absent.\n\nIn ""DITZY"", we have D, I, T, Z, Y. Z and Y are not common, but we have to use available letters.\n\nAnother common letter: U.\n\nWord with U and T.\n\nFor example, ""QUIET"" not.\n\n""BUILT"" L absent.\n\n""DUSTY"" S absent.\n\n""JUDGY"" G absent.\n\n""FUDGY"" F and G absent.\n\nI think ""DITZY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s see if we can find a word with T in position 4.\n\nFor example, ""DIVOT"" O and V? O absent.\n\n""BIGOT"" G and O absent.\n\n""PIVOT"" O absent.\n\n""WIVED"" E absent.\n\n""JIVED"" E absent.\n\n""VIVID"" no T.\n\n""YIVIS"" not a word.\n\nSo it\'s hard.\n\nPerhaps ""MIXED"" E absent.\n\nI think we should go with ""DITZY"".\n\nBut there\'s another word: ""DIZZY"" but no T.\n\nOr ""JAZZY"" no T.\n\nSo ""DITZY"" it is.\n\nBut in ""DITZY"", we have:\n- Position 1: D\n- Position 2: I (but we know I is correct at position 2, so it will be ✓)\n- Position 3: T\n- Position 4: Z\n- Position 5: Y\n\nWe will get feedback on D, T, Z, Y.\n\nIf T is in position 3 in the secret word, we get T(✓), else if T is in position 4, we get T(-) because it\'s present but not at 3.\n\nAnd we test D, Z, Y.\n\nSo it\'s informative.\n\nWe can also consider ""PZAZZ"" not a word.\n\nSo I think ""DITZY"" is the best we can do.\n\nBut let\'s confirm the feedback we expect.\n\nSecret word has I at position 2, T at either 3 or 4, and three other letters from available set.\n\nIf we guess ""DITZY"":\n- D: could be absent or present? We don\'t know.\n- I: will be ✓ (position 2)\n- T: if secret word has T at position 3, then ✓, else if at position 4, then - (because present but not at 3)\n- Z: ?\n- Y: ?\n\nThen based on feedback, we can proceed.\n\nAnother word: ""JITTY"" not common, and T at position 3? J,I,T,T,Y two T\'s.\n\nInvalid.\n\n""BITTY"" invalid.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""DITZY"".\n\nBut to be more common, what about ""MIXTY"" not a word.\n\nOr ""VITZY"" not.\n\nSo ""DITZY"" is acceptable.\n\nPerhaps ""DICKY"" but C and K? C is absent.\n\nC is absent.\n\nSo no.\n\n""DIKED"" E absent.\n\n""DIKEY"" not common.\n\nI think we have to use ""DITZY"".\n\nBut let\'s think of a different approach: maybe we don\'t put I in position 2? But we know I is fixed at position 2, so in our guess, we must have I at position 2 to avoid wasting a position? Because if we put I elsewhere, we know it will be - or x, but since it\'s fixed at 2, if we put it elsewhere, it will be - (because present but wrong position), which we already know, so it\'s better to keep it at position 2 to free up other positions for new letters.\n\nIn this case, for position 2, we must put I, because it\'s correct and we can get a ✓, which doesn\'t cost us information.\n\nSo position 2 must be I.\n\nThen for T, we put it in a new position, say 3 or 4.\n\nSo ""DITZY"" is fine.\n\nAnother word: ""PITZA"" not a word.\n\n""PIZZA"" has Z twice and A absent.\n\nNot.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""DITZY"".\n\nBut let\'s write it.\n\n<guess>ditzy</guess>\n\nBut we have to make sure it\'s 5 letters.\n\nD-I-T-Z-Y.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps ""WIFTY"" not a word.\n\nSo I think that\'s it.### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E.\n   - **Guess 2 (""toils"")**: \n     - T is present but wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 1.\n     - O, L, S are absent (x). Excluded letters: O, L, S.\n     - I is present but wrong position (-), so I is in the word but not at position 3.\n   - **Guess 3 (""fight"")**:\n     - F, G, H are absent (x). Excluded letters: F, G, H.\n     - I is correct position (✓), so I is in the word and fixed at position 2.\n     - T is present but wrong position (-), so T is in the word but not at position 5.\n   \n   **Summary**:\n   - Excluded letters (15 total): A, C, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S (from guesses 1-3).\n   - Confirmed letters: \n     - I is fixed at position 2 (from ""fight"" ✓).\n     - T is present but not in positions 1 or 5 (from ""toils"" - at pos 1 and ""fight"" - at pos 5). T must be in position 3 or 4.\n   - Remaining letters available (not excluded and not yet used): B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n   - Since I and T are confirmed, the word has 3 unknown letters from the remaining pool. No duplicates are assumed.\n\n2. **Deduce Word Structure**:\n   - Position 2 is fixed as I.\n   - T must be in position 3 or 4 (positions 1 and 5 are ruled out for T).\n   - Two possible patterns:\n     - If T is in position 3: `_ I T _ _`\n     - If T is in position 4: `_ I _ T _`\n   - The unknown positions (1, 3/4, and 5) must be filled with letters from the available set (B, D, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\n3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:\n   - Prioritize testing T\'s position to resolve ambiguity (position 3 vs. 4) while introducing new high-frequency letters.\n   - Place T in position 3 to test if it is correct (if not, T must be in position 4).\n   - Fill other positions with common unused letters (e.g., D, Y, Z) to maximize information.\n   - Avoid redundant placements (e.g., I is fixed at position 2, so no need to test elsewhere; T should not be placed in positions 1 or 5).\n\n4. **Word Selection**:\n   - Target pattern: `_ I T _ _` (to test T in position 3).\n   - Possible words: ""DITZY"" fits the pattern and uses available letters (D, Z, Y are new and relatively common).\n     - D in position 1 (new).\n     - I in position 2 (fixed, will be ✓).\n     - T in position 3 (testing for correctness).\n     - Z in position 4 (new).\n     - Y in position 5 (new).\n   - ""DITZY"" is a valid English word (meaning silly or scatterbrained) and tests:\n     - Whether T is in position 3 (✓ or -).\n     - Presence of D, Z, Y (which could be in the word or absent).\n\n5. **Expected Outcomes**:\n   - If T is in position 3: Feedback will show T(✓), confirming T\'s position.\n   - If T is not in position 3: Feedback will show T(-), confirming T must be in position 4.\n   - Feedback on D, Z, Y will reveal if any are present, narrowing possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>ditzy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: fight -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)\nGuess 4: ditzy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) T(✓) Z(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for Guess 4: ""ditzy"" -> D(x) I(✓) T(✓) Z(x) Y(✓)\nThis means:\n- D: absent (so D is not in the word)\n- I: correct and in position 2\n- T: correct and in position 3\n- Z: absent\n- Y: correct and in position 5\n\nSo now we know:\n- Position 2: I\n- Position 3: T\n- Position 5: Y\n- Therefore, the word is _ I T _ Y\n\nAlso, we have the following letters excluded (from previous feedback):\n- From Guess 1: C, R, A, N, E (all absent)\n- From Guess 2: O, L, S (absent) and note T and I are present (but we now know their positions)\n- From Guess 3: F, G, H (absent)\n- From Guess 4: D, Z (absent)\n\nSo excluded letters: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S, Z (13 letters)\n\nAvailable letters: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X\n\nNow, the secret word is _ I T _ Y, and we need to fill the first and fourth positions with two letters from the available set, without duplicates (since all letters so far are distinct).\n\nWe must find a valid English word of the form [letter1] I T [letter2] Y.\n\nNow, we test letter1 and letter2 from the available pool.\n\nCommon possibilities: we need words ending with ""ITY"", but with a letter in between? Actually, it\'s I T [letter2] Y, so the ending is ""T?Y"".\n\nPattern: * I T * Y\n\nLet\'s think of common words:\n- ""PITY"" but that\'s 4 letters. We need 5.\n- ""MITY""? Not common.\n- ""CITY"" but C is excluded.\n- ""KITTY"" has two T\'s and T is already in position 3? Also, K and Y: but we have position 1 and 4. ""KITTY"" is K-I-T-T-Y -> two T\'s so invalid because we assumed no duplicates.\n\nActually, we must avoid duplicates because we haven\'t seen any duplicate letters so far.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""B"" as first letter: ""BITY? What? ""B"" I T * Y -> e.g., ""BITTY"" has two T\'s -> invalid.\n- ""M"" as first: ""MITY""? ""MITY"" is not a word. ""MISTY"" but S excluded and position 4 is T? No, position 4 must be empty.\n\nSpecifically, the word must be 5 letters: first letter, then I, T, fourth letter, Y.\n\nSo: ? I T ? Y\n\nCommon words: \n- ""PITHY"" but H and we have I? But ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y -> H is excluded (from guess 3: H absent). So not.\n- ""WITTY"" has two T\'s -> invalid.\n- ""DITTY"" D excluded and two T\'s -> no.\n\nAvailable letters: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X.\n\nTry P: ""PIT*Y"" -> possibilities: ""PITAY""? A excluded. ""PITEY""? E excluded. ""PITY"" is 4 letters. Not.\n\nWith M: ""MITY""? Not a word. ""MISTY"" S excluded.\n\nJ: ""J"" I T ? Y -> ""JITNY""? N excluded. ""JITHY""? H excluded. No common word.\n\nK: ""K"" I T ? Y -> ""KITTY"" invalid duplicate. ""KITHY""? H excluded. ""KITSY""? S excluded.\n\nQ: ""Q"" I T ? Y -> ""QIT"" not a word.\n\nU: ""U"" I T ? Y -> ""UIT"" not. ""UNIT"" E? ""UNITY"" -> U-N-I-T-Y? But N is excluded. And positions: if ""UNITY"", it would be U(1), N(2) but we need I at position 2. Conflict.\n\nV: ""V"" I T ? Y -> ""VIT*Y"". ""VITAY""? A excluded. ""VITY"" not 5 letters.\n\nW: ""W"" I T ? Y -> ""WITTY"" duplicate. ""WITLY""? L excluded. ""WINDY"" N excluded and D excluded. ""WILLY"" L excluded and duplicate L? Not.\n\nX: ""X"" I T ? Y -> ""XITY"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""MINTY"" but N excluded and M-I-N-T-Y -> but position 2 should be I, so ""MINTY"" has M(1), I(2), but then N(3) but we need T at position 3. Conflict.\n\nWait, we have position 3 fixed as T. So the word is [letter1] I T [letter4] Y.\n\nSo ""M"" I T ""?"" Y: e.g., ""MITTY"" which is not common and has two T\'s? Not allowed.\n\nAnother idea: ""PITY"" extended? No.\n\nPerhaps I missed a letter: U. ""U"" I T ? Y: ""UITWY"" no.\n\nBut note: available letters include B, so ""B"" I T ? Y -> ""BITBY""? No. ""BITSY""? S excluded.\n\nNow, real English words: \n- ""BIGLY"" G and L excluded? Not.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""PIETY"": P-I-E-T-Y -> but E is excluded, and T is in position 4? Wait, ""PIETY"" is P-I-E-T-Y -> positions: P1, I2, E3, T4, Y5? But we need T at position 3. So position 3 is E, but we need it as T. So conflict.\n\nIn ""PIETY"", T is at position 4, which would be our fourth slot? So pattern: P-I-E-T-Y? But in our case, position 3 must be T, so it can\'t be E. Therefore, not matching.\n\nWe need a word where after I is T. So the third letter is T.\n\nFor example, ""CITY"" is C-I-T-Y? That\'s 4 letters. We need 5 letters.\n\nThe word ""PITHY"" is P-I-T-H-Y -> that\'s 5 letters: positions 1:P, 2:I, 3:T, 4:H, 5:Y. However, H is excluded (from Guess 3: H absent). So not.\n\nSimilarly, ""WITHY"" W-I-T-H-Y -> H absent.\n\n""KITTY"" K-I-T-T-Y -> two T\'s -> not allowed.\n\n""BATTY"" -> A and two T\'s? A excluded.\n\n""MITT"" is 4 letters.\n\nPerhaps ""DITTY"" -> D and two T\'s? D excluded.\n\nBut we have excluded so many letters.\n\nAnother possibility: ""POTTY"" O excluded and two T\'s.\n\nWe must find a word with the correct pattern and using only available letters.\n\nAvailable: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X\n\nNow, let\'s try ""MITBY"" not a word.\n\n""BITMY"" not.\n\n"" JIT "" not.\n\nPerhaps ""VITAY"" not.\n\nWait, one word: ""PIXIE"" -> P-I-X-I-E -> but two I\'s? And E excluded. Not.\n\nAnother word: ""MIXUP"" U and P -> M-I-X-U-P -> positions: M1, I2, X3, U4, P5? But we need T at position 3? Here it is X. So unless X is T? No, T is required.\n\nThe only word I can think of is ""MISTY"" but S excluded.\n\nWait, perhaps ""WIGHT"" -> W-I-G-H-T -> but G and H absent? Also, T is at the end? But we need T at position 3? Here it is position 5: W1,I2,G3,H4,T5? But we need T at 3 and Y at 5? Not matching.\n\nWe need Y at position 5.\n\nSo words ending in Y with the pattern * I T * Y.\n\nCommon words: ""NITRY"" not common? ""NITTY"" N excluded and duplicate T.\n\n""RITZY"" R excluded and Z excluded.\n\nBut we haven\'t used B, M, P, and some others.\n\nPerhaps ""BINTY"" not a word.\n\n""PINTY"" not.\n\n""JUMBY"" J,U,M,B,Y -> but does it fit ""J"" I T ? Y -> no T.\n\nWe must have T at position 3.\n\nThink of: city -> 4 letters. \npity -> 4.\n\nBut there is ""PITHY"" which is 5, but H absent.\n\nAnother word: ""WIFTY"" not common, and F excluded.\n\nPerhaps ""Z"" but Z absent.\n\nI recall a word: ""ditzy"" was used, and now we need a new guess with the constraints.\n\nPerhaps ""kitty"" is not allowed because duplicate.\n\nAnother word: ""MITTS"" is not allowed because duplicate T and S absent.\n\nWait, the only common word that fits is ""PITY"" but 4 letters? There must be one.\n\nLet\'s list all English words of form [B J K M P Q U V W X] I T [B J K M P Q U V W X] Y\n\nFor example, with M: M I T ? Y\n\nWhat can the fourth letter be? It has to form a word.\n\nM I T H Y: h absent -> not.\n\nM I T M Y: invalid duplicate if we avoid duplicates? We don\'t know for sure that there is a duplicate, but we haven\'t seen any duplicate so far, so we keep that assumption.\n\nSimilarly, M I T B Y: is ""MITBY"" a word? No.\n\nM I T J Y: ""MITJY"" no.\n\nSimilarly for other starting letters.\n\nWith B: B I T B Y? ""BITBY"" not a word.\n\nB I T J Y no.\n\nWith P: P I T B Y: ""PITBY"" not a word.\n\nP I T P Y: duplicate.\n\nP I T K Y: ""PITKY"" not a word.\n\nWith K: K I T K Y: duplicate.\n\nK I T M Y: ""KITMY"" not.\n\nWith W: W I T B Y: ""WITBY"" not.\n\nW I T M Y: ""WITMY"" not.\n\nWith U: U I T B Y: ""UITBY"" not.\n\nEtc.\n\nPerhaps ""BITTY"" is 5-letter: B-I-T-T-Y, but two T\'s -> not allowed.\n\nThe word ""pithy"" came to mind again, but H is excluded.\n\nAnother word: ""dirty"" D and R excluded.\n\n""misty"" M-I-S-T-Y: S excluded.\n\n""cattily"" too long.\n\nPerhaps ""testy"" T at the beginning? Not pattern.\n\nWe must have T at position 3.\n\nMaybe ""latin"" not.\n\nWait, perhaps ""METY"" not.\n\nI think we have a limited pool.\n\nAnother uncommon word: ""vitry"" not English.\n\nPerhaps ""brit"" is shorter.\n\nOr ""witty"" has duplicate T.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps we missed a letter. Available letters include U, so ""QUIET"" not, but ""QUITE"" E excluded.\n\n""QUINT"" N excluded.\n\n""QUIT"" 4 letters.\n\n""QUIM"" not helpful.\n\nPerhaps The word is ""PITHY"" is not allowed.\n\nBut in the feedback, we already have excluded letters.\n\nAnother idea: what if there is a duplicate letter? But we haven\'t seen any, so we keep the no-duplicate assumption.\n\nPerhaps ""BUTTY"" B-U-T-T-Y, but U and duplicate T, and also T at position 3? ""BUTTY"" is B-U-T-T-Y -> positions:1:B,2:U,3:T,4:T,5:Y -> two T\'s, so invalid.\n\n similarly.\n\nPerhaps ""kithe"" not 5 and not.\n\nAfter reevaluating feedback, we see that in Guess 4, we have Y at position 5 is correct. And we have I at 2 and T at 3 correct.\n\nSo the word is for sure * I T * Y.\n\nNow, letters not excluded: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X.\n\nFor the fourth letter (position 4), it must be one of these, and it forms the word.\n\nFor example, ""MITY"" is not a word, but with a first letter: e.g., ""EMITY"" E excluded and no.\n\n""AMITY"" A excluded.\n\n""        "" \n\nPerhaps ""PIXY"" not, but """"PIXTY"" not a word.\n\nBut there is ""PIETY"" but E excluded and position 3 is E, not T? ""PIETY"" is P-I-E-T-Y -> position 3 is E, not T. But we need position 3 to be T, so it doesn\'t match.\n\nSimilarly, ""DUTY"" D excluded and shorter.\n\nI think the only possibility is that our assumption of no duplicates is wrong, or we missed a word.\n\nLet\'s think of words ending in ""ITY"": like ""CITY"" -> 4.\n\n""MOBILITY"" too long.\n\n""MAJESTY"" not matching pattern.\n\n""BAY   "" not.\n\nAnother idea: ""BITTY"" might be accepted as a word? But it has two T\'s, and we haven\'t encountered a duplicate, but it\'s possible.\n\nIn Guess 4, ""ditzy"" has D,I,T,Z,Y — all distinct.\n\nNo indication of duplicates.\n\nBut perhaps in the secret word, there is a duplicate? Unlikely at this stage.\n\nPerhaps Z is not excluded yet? No, in Guess 4, Z(x), so absent.\n\nLet\'s list again the available letters: B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X.\n\nNow, possible words:\n- ""JUICY"" but C excluded and U-I-C-Y -> not.\n- ""BUMPY"" M and P, but positions: B-U-M-P-Y -> not I at position 2 and T at 3.\n- ""Jumpy"" J-U-M-P-Y -> no I and T at 2 and 3.\n\nWe need the second letter to be I, third to be T.\n\nSo must be: first letter and fourth letter from the list.\n\nCommon words I can find are rare, but one word: ""TIGHT"" T at position 1 and G and H absent.\n\nNot.\n\n""LIGHT"" L and G,H absent.\n\nAnother word: ""NIGHT"" N and H absent.\n\nPerhaps ""fight"" was used, and G,H absent.\n\nThe only word I can think of is ""mity"" not, or "" bit my"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""MID DY"" not.\n\nWe have to consider that position 4 might be U or something.\n\nFor example, ""U"" as fourth letter: ""? I T U Y""\n\nEnglish words: ""SITUY"" no. ""PITUY"" no.\n\nExcept for ""bitus"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""VITUS"" not valid.\n\nIt\'s possible that the word is ""MITIS"" but S excluded and ""Mitis"" may not be common.\n\nBut let\'s look for an answer: perhaps ""PITHY"" is not the only option, but H is excluded.\n\nI recall that in the feedback, we have I and T and Y fixed.\n\nSo the word must be like XITY, but 4 letters, or something 5.\n\nAnother word: ""BATTY"" has A and double T? B-A-T-T-Y -> A excluded and two T\'s.\n\n not.\n\n""DITTO"" O excluded.\n\n""TINTY"" T at position 1 and N excluded.\n\nAfter research, I think ""WITTY"" is the only common word, but it has two T\'s.\n\nPerhaps in this game, ""WITTY"" could be used, but we have not seen any duplicate, so it\'s risky.\n\nGather the known correct letters: positions 2,3,5: I, T, Y.\n\nAnd we have to fill position 1 and 4.\n\nPosition 4 must be a letter that can form T*Y? But in English, words like: empty, but E excluded.\n\nAmple not.\n\nPerhaps ""Q"" Q I T ? Y? ""QITY"" or ""QUITY"" not words.\n\nAnother possibility: ""CITY"" is 4, but ""CITYe"" not.\n\nI think we have to guess with the available letters.\n\nFor example, ""PITY"" is 4 letters, so not.\n\nPerhaps ""MIGHT"" but G and H absent, and M-I-G-H-T -> position 3 G, not T.\n\nNot matching.\n\nLet\'s try ""KIPY"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""JITNEY"" len 6.\n\nI am out of ideas.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the word is ""picky"" but C excluded and no T.\n\nOur known letters require I at 2, T at 3.\n\nSo the word is [letter1] I T [letter4] Y\n\nWith letters4 from B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X.\n\nThe only common word I can now think of is ""PITKY"" but not a word, or ""MITBY"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""W"" I T ""H Y"" with H? But H is excluded.\n\nWait, there is the word ""WITHY"" W-I-T-H-Y , which means a tough gn willow, and H is in it, but H was guess3 and is absent, so can\'t be.\n\nBut in Guess3, H(x) -> not in word, so cannot.\n\nSimilarly, ""PITHY"" not.\n\nLet\'s double-check excluded letters:\n- Guess1: C,R,A,N,E (x)\n- Guess2: O,L,S (x), and T and I present\n- Guess3: F,G,H (x)\n- Guess4: D,Z (x)\n\nSo H is excluded.\n\nWe must use only the available letters.\n\nPossibly "" B"" I T ""W"" Y -> ""BITWY"" not a word.\n"" J"" I T ""M"" Y -> ""JITMY"" not.\n"" M"" I T ""V"" Y -> ""MITVY"" not.\n"" P"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""PITUY"" not.\n\n rare word ""quitz"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""UM "" not.\n\nI think we have to choose a word that exists, like ""MITTY"" even if rare, or accept duplication.\n\nBut let\'s look online or think harder.\n\nAnother word: ""KICKS"" not.\n\n perhaps ""bicep"" not.\n\nI recall that ""party"" but A and R excluded.\n\n"" ofالا\n\nPerhaps ""PIXIE"" not matching.\n\nOne last idea: ""DITZY"" was used, but the secret word might be ""DIZZY"" but Z is excluded and D excluded, but in feedback for ""ditzy"", Z(x), so not in word, and D(x), so not. ""DIZZY"" has Z and D, both absent.\n\nSo not.\n\nGiven the difficulty, maybe the word is ""city"" but it\'s 4 letters, so must be 5.\n\nUnless the puzzle allows plurals? But ""cities"" is 6.\n\n ""pits"" not.\n\nI think we have to make a guess with the pattern and available letters.\n\nFor example, ""M"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""MITYU"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""V"" I T ""A"" Y -> A excluded.\n\n""B"" I T ""E"" Y -> E excluded.\n\n""B"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""BITYU"" not.\n\nThe only letter left is why not ""U"" - like ""U"" I T ""B"" Y: ""UITYB"" not.\n\nPerhaps the fourth letter is P: ""P"" I T ""P"" Y -> duplicate.\n\nOr ""W"" I T ""W"" Y -> duplicate.\n\nSo with 10 available letters, none form a common word.\n\nBut there must be a word. We missed ""K"" for the fourth letter: ""K"" I T ""K"" Y -> ""KITKY"" not.\n\nAnd ""B"" for fourth: ""B"" I T ""B"" Y -> ""BITBY"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""J"" forfirst and ""B"" for fourth: ""J"" I T ""B"" Y -> ""JITBY"" not a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""J"" I T ""U"" Y -> ""JITYU"" not.\n\n""P"" I T ""K"" Y -> ""PITKY"" not.\n\nBut "" PIT key"" not.\n\nAnother common word: ""MINTY"" not matching pattern.\n\nPerhaps ""dirty"" but letters excluded.\n\n I think one English word is ""pithy"", but H is absent.\n\nOr ""withy"", same thing.\n\nPerhaps ""vughy"" not.\n\nGiven the constraints, perhaps the word is ""BITOKY"" not.\n\nOr maybe in Allow, ""JITNEY"" is too long.\n\nI see an error: position 4 is between T and Y, so the word is ? I T ? Y\n\nLetters that can be for position 4: vowels like U, so ""ITUY"" not a syllable.\n\nPerhaps ""ITEM"" not.\n\nLet\'s search for 5-letter words ending in ""Y"" with third letter ""T"" and second letter ""I"".\n\nFor example, in English, we have:\n- A little common: ""PITHY"", ""WITHY"", "" DITCHY"" not, ""KITTY"", "" BITTY"", ""WITTY"", "" MITTY"", ""NITTY"", ""PITTY"", ""TITTY"", ""ZITTY"", etc.\n\nAmong these, ""PITHY"" and ""WITHY"" have H, which is excluded.\n""KITTY"", ""BITTY"", etc., have two T\'s, so if we allow duplicates, then ""KITTY"" could be, but it has T at position 3 and 4, so duplicate T.\n\nBut in the secret word, we know T is at position 3, so if there is another T at position 4, it would be duplicate.\n\nSimilarly, "" WITTY"" has T at position 3 and 4.\n\nIn Guess 4, we have ""ditzy"" dit zy, so D-I-T-Z-Y. If the secret word had two T\'s, then in position 4 is Z, which is absent, so we got Z(x), and for T at position 3, we got T(✓), but if there were another T, it would have shown in feedback? Let\'s review the feedback rules.\n\nThe feedback for ""ditzy"":\n- D: absent (x)\n- I: correct position (✓)\n- T: correct position (✓)\n- Z: absent (x)\n- Y: correct position (✓)\n\nIf the secret word had another T, say at position 4, then when we placed Z at position 4, we would have expected a feedback for that position: the letter Y is at position 5 and is correct, but for position 4, we put Z, which is not T, but T is in the word not at that position? If secret has T at position 4, and we put Z, then the feedback for that position is \'x\' for Z, and for the T in the word, since we already have one T that is correctly placed (position 3), and if there is another T, it should be marked as present if not correct.\n\nBut note: feedback only marks a letter as present (-) if it is in the word but not in that position, and if there are multiple, but in this case, for each guess position, only one symbol.\n\nBut in our guess, position 4 is Z and we got \'x\', so Z is not in the word. If there were a T at position 4, then for the T overall, we have one T matched at position 3 with ✓, and another T could be elsewhere? But in our guess, we didn\'t place a T at position 4, so we would have a \'-\' for the T that is at position 4 only if we placed a T in another position and it got matched? It\'s complicated.\n\nTo simplify, in feedback, for each letter in the guess, it checks the secret word:\n\n- For the T in position 3 of the guess, it matches the T in position 3 of the secret, so it\'s ✓.\n- If there is another T in the secret at position 4, when we place Z at position 4, it will be \'x\' because Z not present, and with no additional feedback since we didn\'t place T for the extra T.\n\nSo the feedback does not reveal the presence of duplicate letters in other positions if we don\'t guess those letters.\n\nBut for position 4, we guessed Z and it\'s \'x\', so that position is not T in the secret? Not necessarily: it\'s \'x\' means the secret does not have Z at any position, but the letter in position 4 of the secret could be something else.\n\nIf the secret had a T at position 4, then when we place Z at position 4, we get \'x\' for not being T or present, but the T at position 4 is not reflected because we didn\'t put a T there.\n\nIn summary, the feedback does not indicate the presence of a letter in a position we didn\'t guess.\n\nBut for the letter T, we are only placing it at position 3, so if there is another T in the secret, we wouldn\'t know yet.\n\nSo it\'s possible that the secret has a duplicate T.\n\nFor example, secret word ""WITTY"" W-I-T-T-Y.\n\nBut in ""ditzy"", when we put T at position 3, it got ✓, and for position 4, we put Z (x), so that doesn\'t reveal the true letter at position 4.\n\nThen position 1 is W, position 4 is T, position 5 is Y.\n\nBut ""WITTY"" has I at 2, T at 3, T at 4, Y at 5.\n\nThen with available letters, W is available.\n\nThen for position 1, we have W, and position 4 should be T.\n\nBut T is already at position 3, so duplicate.\n\nIn guess 4, we put D for position 1, which is not W, so x.\n\nSo secret could be ""WITTY"" and it uses letters W, I, T, T, Y.\n\nBut feedback for Guess 4: for position 1, D (x) -> correct.\n position 2: I (✓)\n position 3: T (✓)\n position 4: Z (x) -> correct.\n position 5: Y (✓)\n\nSo it\'s compatible, but not revealed duplicate.\n\nSimilarly, ""KITTY"" K-I-T-T-Y, with K as position 1.\n\nOr ""BITTY"" B-I-T-T-Y.\n\n etc.\n\nSo perhaps we should guess a word that has T at position 4 to test or accept duplicates.\n\nSince we have positions 2,3,5 known, we for the fourth guess, we have to guess position 1 and 4.\n\nTo test, we can guess a word that has position 1 and 4 filled.\n\nFor example, ""W"" for position 1 and ""T"" for position 4: ""W I T T Y"", אבל this has two T\'s and we are guessing T at position 4, which might give - if not correct, or ✓ if correct.\n\nBut if the secret has T at position 4, we get T(✓), otherwise, etc.\n\nSince we have only one guess left for positions let\'s say, but we have two guesses left overall.\n\nWe are at guess 4 feedback, so next is guess 5.\n\nSo for the fifth guess, we can try ""WITTY"" to test.\n\nIf it is, we win.\n\nIf not, etc.\n\nOr ""KITTY"" etc.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""WITTY"" as a common word.\n\nSo guess: ""WITTY""\n\nThen we will see.\n\n another common one is ""KITTY"".\n\nBut ""W"" is available.\n\nSo ""WITTY"" is W-I-T-T-Y.\n\nWe know I at 2, T at 3, Y at 5 will be correct, so feedback will show:\n- W: position 1 -> ""W"" in secret? If yes, ✓ or -\n- T: position 4 -> if T, then ✓, else if present, - or x.\n\nBut we already know T is present, so for position 4, if T, ✓, else - if present but wrong position? But if not, x.\n\nIn ""WITTY"", we put duplicate T, so the T at position 4 may be \'x\' if not present? No, since T is in the word, if it\'s not in position 4, we get - if there is another occurrence to match? Feedback rules: each guess letter is evaluated; if the letter is in the word, but that position is wrong, we get -.\n\nFor the second T at position 4 in ""WITTY"", if the secret has a T at position 4, we get ✓ for that T. If not, we get - if there is another T position (which there isn\'t because position 3 is T, but it\'s already used), it might not get - because we already matched the T.\n\nIt\'s messy.\n\n the standard way: in feedback, for each letter in guess, it checks against the secret.\n\n- Position 1: W. If the secret\'s position 1 is W, then ✓. Otherwise, if W is in the secret but not at position 1, then -.\n- Position 2: I. Will be ✓.\n- Position 3: T. Will be ✓.\n- Position 4: T. If secret position 4 is T, then ✓. Otherwise, if there is another T not yet matched, then -.\n- Position 5: Y. Will be ✓.\n\nThe secret has at least two T\'s. If not, feedback for position 4 will be x for the second T in the guess letter.\n\nIf the secret has exactly one T, then the T at position 4 will be x.\n\nBut in this case, for ""ditzy"", we had T at position 3 and got only one \'T\' in feedback? We got T(✓) for position 3, and no indication of position 4 because we didn\'t put T there.\n\nBut it\'s possible that there is another T in position 4.\n\nSo to discredit, we can assume no duplicate and keep looking, or guess a word that assumes no duplicate.\n\nAnother possibility: ""JIVEY"" not.\n\nI think we have to guess ""WITTY"" or similar.\n\nOr ""PITAY"" not.\n\nPerhaps the letter is U as in ""DUTY"" excluded.\n\nLet\'s list all existing words that match the pattern.\n\nFrom an English dictionary, words like:\n- ""pithy""\n- ""withy""\n- ""ditty"" ( duplicate T? ""DITTY"" is D-I-T-T-Y -> two T\'s)\n- ""kitty""\n- "" bitty""\n\nAll these either have duplicate T or exclude letters.\n\nOther words: "" city"" only 4.\n\nSo for the sake ofゲーム, we guess ""WITTY"".\n\n<guess>WITTY</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Previous Feedback Analysis**:\n   - **Guess 1: crane → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**:\n     - Letters C, R, A, N, E are absent → Excluded: A, C, E, N, R.\n   - **Guess 2: toils → FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)**:\n     - T is present but not in position 1.\n     - I is present but not in position 3.\n     - O, L, S are absent → Excluded: L, O, S.\n   - **Guess 3: fight → FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)**:\n     - I is in position 2 (fixed).\n     - T is present but not in position 5.\n     - F, G, H are absent → Excluded: F, G, H.\n   - **Guess 4: ditzy → FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) T(✓) Z(x) Y(✓)**:\n     - I is in position 2 (confirmed).\n     - T is in position 3 (fixed).\n     - Y is in position 5 (fixed).\n     - D and Z are absent → Excluded: D, Z.\n\n2. **Deductions**:\n   - **Fixed Positions**:\n     - Position 2: I\n     - Position 3: T\n     - Position 5: Y\n   - **Remaining Positions**: Position 1 and position 4 are unknown.\n   - **Excluded Letters**: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S, Z (13 letters).\n   - **Available Letters**: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X (10 letters).\n   - **Word Pattern**: `[position1] I T [position4] Y`.\n   - **No Duplicates Assumed**: No duplicate letters indicated in previous feedback.\n\n3. **Word Selection**:\n   - Goal: Fill position 1 and 4 with unused letters from the available pool.\n   - Constraints:\n     - Must be a valid English word.\n     - Avoids excluded letters and duplicates.\n     - Common words like ""PITHY"" (H excluded), ""WITHY"" (H excluded), ""KITTY"" (duplicate T), or ""BITTY"" (duplicate T) are invalid.\n   - Challenge: No common words fit the pattern `[B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X] I T [B,J,K,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X] Y`.\n   - After reviewing:\n     - Rare words (e.g., ""DITZY"" was used) are not helpful here.\n     - ""WITTY"" is a common word that fits the pattern (W-I-T-T-Y) but introduces a duplicate T.\n     - However:\n       - Duplicate T is possible since feedback doesn\'t explicitly deny duplicates (e.g., ""ditzy"" gave T(✓) for only one position).\n       - ""WITTY"" tests for a duplicate T scenario:\n         - Position 1: W (new letter).\n         - Position 4: T (potential duplicate).\n         - If correct, W(✓) and T(✓) at position 4 confirms duplicate T.\n         - If not, feedback will provide new information (e.g., x or - for T at position 4, revealing its true position).\n   - ""WITTY"" uses high-frequency letters and is a strategic guess to resolve ambiguity:\n     - W is available and commonly used.\n     - Tests for duplicate T.\n\n4. **Strategic Choice**:  \n   - Guessing ""WITTY"" maximizes information gain for the final guess by:\n     - Potentially confirming the secret word.\n     - Revealing the status of position 1 (if W is correct/incorrect) and position 4 (if T is present there).\n   - Alternative words like ""KITTY"" or ""BITTY"" are less optimal due to lower letter frequency.\n\n<guess>WITTY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: toils -> FEEDBACK: T(-) O(x) I(-) L(x) S(x)\nGuess 3: fight -> FEEDBACK: F(x) I(✓) G(x) H(x) T(-)\nGuess 4: ditzy -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(✓) T(✓) Z(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 5: WITTY -> FEEDBACK: W(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for Guess 5: ""WITTY"" -> W(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
This means:
- W: absent (x) -> so W is not in the word.
- I: correct at position 2 (✓)
- First T (position 3): correct (✓) -> we already knew this.
- Second T (position 4): correct (✓) -> this is new! So T is also at position 4? But that would mean two T's in the word.
- Y: correct at position 5 (✓)

But note: the feedback shows T(✓) for both position 3 and position 4. This means the secret word has T at position 3 and T at position 4. So the word has duplicate T's.

Therefore, the secret word is: _ I T T Y

We know position 2: I, position 3: T, position 4: T, position 5: Y. Only position 1 is missing.

From feedback, we have:
- W is absent (from this guess), so position 1 is not W.

Also, from previous feedback, we have excluded letters: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S, Z, and now W.

Available letters: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X.

But the secret word has two T's and I and Y, so the only missing letter is for position 1, and it must be one of the available letters.

The word is [letter] I T T Y.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? I T T Y.

Common words: ""BITTY"", ""KITTY"", ""MITTY"", ""PITTY"", etc.

But we have to check which of these are valid and use an available letter for the first position.

Available for position 1: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X.

Now, ""BITTY"": B-I-T-T-Y -> B is available.
""KITTY"": K-I-T-T-Y -> K available.
""MITTY"": M-I-T-T-Y -> M available.
""PITTY"": P-I-T-T-Y -> P available.
Also, ""WITTY"" we tried and W is absent, so not.

Now, we need to choose one. Since we have only one position to guess, and we have multiple options, we can pick the most common one.

But note: we have only one guess left (if this is the sixth guess), so we must be correct.

We can list the possibilities: BITTY, KITTY, MITTY, PITTY.

But are there others? Like ""TITTY"" but T is already used twice? ""TITTY"" would have T at position 1, but we have two T's already, and position 1 is a new letter? ""TITTY"" is T-I-T-T-Y -> that would be three T's? Not likely, and T is not in the available list for new letters? We know T is in the word, but we are not introducing a new T.

The available letters are for a new letter, so position 1 must be a letter not yet used (except T is already used, but we can have it again? But we are not sure).

But in the available list, we have B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X. T is not in this list because we are considering new letters, but T is already known to be in the word.

For position 1, we need a letter that is either one of the available or T? But if we put T, it would be a third T? Unlikely.

So we assume position 1 is a new letter from the available set.

Now, which of BITTY, KITTY, MITTY, PITTY are valid words?

All are valid: 
- BITTY: meaning composed of bits or small pieces.
- KITTY: a fund or a young cat.
- MITTY: less common, but a surname or from ""Walter Mitty"".
- PITTY: variant of pity, but not standard; usually ""pity"".

""PITTY"" is not commonly accepted; the standard spelling is ""pity"" (4 letters). So we can exclude ""PITTY"".

Similarly, ""MITTY"" is not very common.

So between ""BITTY"" and ""KITTY"", both are common.

We have to choose one.

But we have no information to distinguish, so we can pick one arbitrarily.

Since we have not used B or K, both are possible.

But note: in the available letters, we have B and K.

We can guess ""KITTY"" because it is a very common word.

Or ""BITTY"".

But let's see if there is any clue.

In previous guesses, we have not tested B or K, so no direct information.

We can also consider the frequency: K is less common than B? But in word games, ""KITTY"" is a standard guess.

Since we have to choose, I'll go with ""KITTY"".

But wait, the feedback for ""WITTY"" showed that the secret word has T at position 4? Yes, because we got T(✓) at position 4.

So the secret word ends with ""ITTY"".

Therefore, we can guess ""KITTY"".

<guess>KITTY</guess>

But to be thorough, let's confirm the feedback we would get if it's ""KITTY"": 
- K: if position 1 is K, then ✓
- I: ✓
- T: ✓
- T: ✓
- Y: ✓

Similarly for ""BITTY"".

But since we have no way to know, we choose one.

Perhaps ""MITTY"" is also possible, but less common.

I think ""KITTY"" is a good choice.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). Excluded: C, R, A, N, E.
- **Guess 2: toils** → T is present but wrong position (-), O is absent (x), I is present but wrong position (-), L is absent (x), S is absent (x). Excluded: O, L, S. Confirmed: T and I are in the word (T not in position 1, I not in position 3).
- **Guess 3: fight** → F is absent (x), I is correct position (✓) at position 2, G is absent (x), H is absent (x), T is present but wrong position (-). Excluded: F, G, H. Confirmed: I is fixed at position 2, T is in the word but not in position 5.
- **Guess 4: ditzy** → D is absent (x), I is correct (✓) at position 2, T is correct (✓) at position 3, Z is absent (x), Y is correct (✓) at position 5. Excluded: D, Z. Confirmed: Word structure is `_ I T _ Y` (positions 2, 3, 5 fixed as I, T, Y).
- **Guess 5: WITTY** → W is absent (x), I is correct (✓) at position 2, first T is correct (✓) at position 3, second T is correct (✓) at position 4, Y is correct (✓) at position 5. Excluded: W. Confirmed: 
  - The secret word has duplicate T's (T is at positions 3 and 4).
  - The word structure is now `[position1] I T T Y`.

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**: 
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 3: T
  - Position 4: T (newly confirmed)
  - Position 5: Y
- **Unknown position**: Only position 1 remains.
- **Excluded letters (total 14)**: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S, W, Z.
- **Available letters for position 1**: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X.
- **Possible words**: The secret word must be a valid English word ending in `ITTY`. Common options include:
  - **BITTY** (meaning small or fragmented)
  - **KITTY** (meaning a fund or young cat)
  - **MITTY** (less common, e.g., from ""Walter Mitty"")
  - **PITTY** (rare variant of ""pity"", not standard)
- **Elimination**: 
  - ""PITTY"" is not a standard English word (usually ""pity"" is 4 letters).
  - ""MITTY"" is uncommon and may not be accepted in word games.
  - **BITTY** and **KITTY** are both valid and common. No prior feedback distinguishes them (B and K are untested).

### Strategy for Guess 6:
- We have one guess left. Since ""KITTY"" is a high-frequency word (more common than ""BITTY"" in everyday language), it is prioritized.
- Guessing ""KITTY"" tests position 1 with K. If correct, all positions match. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if K is present/absent, but the game ends here.

<guess>KITTY</guess>",KITTY,"We are given feedback for Guess 5: ""WITTY"" -> W(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓)
This means:
- W: absent (x) -> so W is not in the word.
- I: correct at position 2 (✓)
- First T (position 3): correct (✓) -> we already knew this.
- Second T (position 4): correct (✓) -> this is new! So T is also at position 4? But that would mean two T's in the word.
- Y: correct at position 5 (✓)

But note: the feedback shows T(✓) for both position 3 and position 4. This means the secret word has T at position 3 and T at position 4. So the word has duplicate T's.

Therefore, the secret word is: _ I T T Y

We know position 2: I, position 3: T, position 4: T, position 5: Y. Only position 1 is missing.

From feedback, we have:
- W is absent (from this guess), so position 1 is not W.

Also, from previous feedback, we have excluded letters: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S, Z, and now W.

Available letters: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X.

But the secret word has two T's and I and Y, so the only missing letter is for position 1, and it must be one of the available letters.

The word is [letter] I T T Y.

We need a 5-letter word of the form ? I T T Y.

Common words: ""BITTY"", ""KITTY"", ""MITTY"", ""PITTY"", etc.

But we have to check which of these are valid and use an available letter for the first position.

Available for position 1: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X.

Now, ""BITTY"": B-I-T-T-Y -> B is available.
""KITTY"": K-I-T-T-Y -> K available.
""MITTY"": M-I-T-T-Y -> M available.
""PITTY"": P-I-T-T-Y -> P available.
Also, ""WITTY"" we tried and W is absent, so not.

Now, we need to choose one. Since we have only one position to guess, and we have multiple options, we can pick the most common one.

But note: we have only one guess left (if this is the sixth guess), so we must be correct.

We can list the possibilities: BITTY, KITTY, MITTY, PITTY.

But are there others? Like ""TITTY"" but T is already used twice? ""TITTY"" would have T at position 1, but we have two T's already, and position 1 is a new letter? ""TITTY"" is T-I-T-T-Y -> that would be three T's? Not likely, and T is not in the available list for new letters? We know T is in the word, but we are not introducing a new T.

The available letters are for a new letter, so position 1 must be a letter not yet used (except T is already used, but we can have it again? But we are not sure).

But in the available list, we have B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X. T is not in this list because we are considering new letters, but T is already known to be in the word.

For position 1, we need a letter that is either one of the available or T? But if we put T, it would be a third T? Unlikely.

So we assume position 1 is a new letter from the available set.

Now, which of BITTY, KITTY, MITTY, PITTY are valid words?

All are valid: 
- BITTY: meaning composed of bits or small pieces.
- KITTY: a fund or a young cat.
- MITTY: less common, but a surname or from ""Walter Mitty"".
- PITTY: variant of pity, but not standard; usually ""pity"".

""PITTY"" is not commonly accepted; the standard spelling is ""pity"" (4 letters). So we can exclude ""PITTY"".

Similarly, ""MITTY"" is not very common.

So between ""BITTY"" and ""KITTY"", both are common.

We have to choose one.

But we have no information to distinguish, so we can pick one arbitrarily.

Since we have not used B or K, both are possible.

But note: in the available letters, we have B and K.

We can guess ""KITTY"" because it is a very common word.

Or ""BITTY"".

But let's see if there is any clue.

In previous guesses, we have not tested B or K, so no direct information.

We can also consider the frequency: K is less common than B? But in word games, ""KITTY"" is a standard guess.

Since we have to choose, I'll go with ""KITTY"".

But wait, the feedback for ""WITTY"" showed that the secret word has T at position 4? Yes, because we got T(✓) at position 4.

So the secret word ends with ""ITTY"".

Therefore, we can guess ""KITTY"".

<guess>KITTY</guess>

But to be thorough, let's confirm the feedback we would get if it's ""KITTY"": 
- K: if position 1 is K, then ✓
- I: ✓
- T: ✓
- T: ✓
- Y: ✓

Similarly for ""BITTY"".

But since we have no way to know, we choose one.

Perhaps ""MITTY"" is also possible, but less common.

I think ""KITTY"" is a good choice.### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x). Excluded: C, R, A, N, E.
- **Guess 2: toils** → T is present but wrong position (-), O is absent (x), I is present but wrong position (-), L is absent (x), S is absent (x). Excluded: O, L, S. Confirmed: T and I are in the word (T not in position 1, I not in position 3).
- **Guess 3: fight** → F is absent (x), I is correct position (✓) at position 2, G is absent (x), H is absent (x), T is present but wrong position (-). Excluded: F, G, H. Confirmed: I is fixed at position 2, T is in the word but not in position 5.
- **Guess 4: ditzy** → D is absent (x), I is correct (✓) at position 2, T is correct (✓) at position 3, Z is absent (x), Y is correct (✓) at position 5. Excluded: D, Z. Confirmed: Word structure is `_ I T _ Y` (positions 2, 3, 5 fixed as I, T, Y).
- **Guess 5: WITTY** → W is absent (x), I is correct (✓) at position 2, first T is correct (✓) at position 3, second T is correct (✓) at position 4, Y is correct (✓) at position 5. Excluded: W. Confirmed: 
  - The secret word has duplicate T's (T is at positions 3 and 4).
  - The word structure is now `[position1] I T T Y`.

### Deductions:
- **Fixed positions**: 
  - Position 2: I
  - Position 3: T
  - Position 4: T (newly confirmed)
  - Position 5: Y
- **Unknown position**: Only position 1 remains.
- **Excluded letters (total 14)**: A, C, D, E, F, G, H, L, N, O, R, S, W, Z.
- **Available letters for position 1**: B, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, X.
- **Possible words**: The secret word must be a valid English word ending in `ITTY`. Common options include:
  - **BITTY** (meaning small or fragmented)
  - **KITTY** (meaning a fund or young cat)
  - **MITTY** (less common, e.g., from ""Walter Mitty"")
  - **PITTY** (rare variant of ""pity"", not standard)
- **Elimination**: 
  - ""PITTY"" is not a standard English word (usually ""pity"" is 4 letters).
  - ""MITTY"" is uncommon and may not be accepted in word games.
  - **BITTY** and **KITTY** are both valid and common. No prior feedback distinguishes them (B and K are untested).

### Strategy for Guess 6:
- We have one guess left. Since ""KITTY"" is a high-frequency word (more common than ""BITTY"" in everyday language), it is prioritized.
- Guessing ""KITTY"" tests position 1 with K. If correct, all positions match. If incorrect, feedback will confirm if K is present/absent, but the game ends here.",Guess 6: KITTY -> FEEDBACK: K(x) I(✓) T(✓) T(✓) Y(✓),FAIL
