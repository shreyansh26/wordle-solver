We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback that for the first guess ""crane"", all letters are incorrect (x). 
 This means that the secret word contains none of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Therefore, we must choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain any of these letters.

 We need to avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words without these letters.

 Some common starting letters might be: S, T, B, L, P, etc.

 We can try words like ""sight"", ""plumb"", ""dough"", etc. But let's check:

 We must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's try to form a word with other common letters.

 Consider: S, T, L, I, O, U, M, P, B, D, G, H, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"" but let's check the letters: S, L, O, T, H -> none of the forbidden letters.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" has P, I, O, U, S -> also safe.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Since we have eliminated 5 letters, we have 21 left. We should try to use 5 new letters that are common.

 Let's list the frequency of letters in English words (without C, R, A, N, E). The most common remaining letters are: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 We can try ""TOILS"" or ""STOMP"" or ""PILOT"".

 However, note that we are in the second guess and we have no correct letters so far. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me choose ""SPLIT"": 
   S, P, L, I, T -> none of the forbidden letters (C,R,A,N,E). 

 But wait, is ""SPLIT"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is also a good candidate: M, O, I, S, T.

 Another one: ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L -> but we might want to avoid less common letters.

 Since we are early in the game, we should focus on common letters.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has common letters and we haven't tried M, O, I, S, T.

 But note: we are avoiding C,R,A,N,E, and MOIST doesn't have any of those.

 So, I'll go with ""MOIST"".

 However, let me double-check: 
   M: not in {C,R,A,N,E}
   O: not in
   I: not in
   S: not in
   T: not in

 Yes.

 Alternatively, we could use ""PIOUS"" but that has U which is less common. Or ""BUMPY"" but that has B,U,M,P,Y and Y is also less common.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""MOIST"".
</think>
After the first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters being incorrect (C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word), I need to choose a new word that avoids these letters entirely. The new guess should maximize coverage of common unused letters to gather more information. 

I considered words like ""sight,"" ""plumb,"" and ""dough,"" but settled on ""moist"" because:
- It uses common letters (M, O, I, S, T) not yet tested.
- None of its letters (M, O, I, S, T) overlap with the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- It covers vowels (O, I) and frequent consonants (M, S, T), increasing the chance of hits.

We have two guesses and their feedback:

1. ""crane"": All letters are incorrect (x). So the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.

2. ""moist"": 
   - M: x (not in the word at all)
   - O: - (in the word but wrong position)
   - I: x (not in the word)
   - S: - (in the word but wrong position)
   - T: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from ""moist"":
- O, S, T are in the word but in the wrong positions.
- M and I are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word contains O, S, T, and does not contain M, I, and also not C,R,A,N,E from the first guess.

Also, since O, S, T are present but not in the positions they were in ""moist"":
- Position 2: O is incorrect -> so O is not in position 2.
- Position 4: S is incorrect -> so S is not in position 4.
- Position 5: T is incorrect -> so T is not in position 5.

Moreover, from the first guess, we know that C, R, A, N, E, M, I are all absent.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Contains O, S, T (since we know they are in the word).
- Does not contain any of: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.
- And we must place O, S, T in positions that are not their original positions from ""moist"":
  - O cannot be in position 2.
  - S cannot be in position 4.
  - T cannot be in position 5.

Additionally, we need to include two more letters (since it's a 5-letter word) that are not in the excluded list.

We also know the positions from ""moist"":
- Position 1: M (wrong) -> we must avoid M and since it's absent, we cannot use M.
- Position 2: O (wrong position) -> we know O is present, but we must not put O at position 2 again, and we know it must be somewhere else.
- Position 3: I (absent) -> avoid I.
- Position 4: S (wrong position) -> so S is not at 4.
- Position 5: T (wrong position) -> so T is not at 5.

Now, let's list the known present letters: O, S, T.

We need to choose a word that has O, S, T, and two more letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I. So 7 letters excluded.

Available letters: all others: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes O, S, T and two others from the available set.

Moreover, we should avoid placing O at position 2, S at position 4, T at position 5.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let me try to think of words that contain O, S, T.

Some ideas:
- ""ghost"" -> but G,H,O,S,T. But O is at position 3, S at 4, T at 5? 
  - However, in ""moist"", we have S at position 4 and T at position 5 and they were marked wrong position. So in ""ghost"":
    - Position 4: S (but we cannot have S at position 4 because feedback said S is in the word but not at position 4).
    - Similarly, T is at position 5 which is not allowed.
  - So ""ghost"" is invalid because S and T are in the forbidden positions.

Alternatively, ""boost"" -> B,O,O,S,T. But two O's? Let's check:
  - Positions: B(1), O(2), O(3), S(4), T(5)
  - But O is at position 2 -> we cannot have O at position 2 (from ""moist"" feedback). Also S at 4 and T at 5 are forbidden. So not good.

""posts"" -> P,O,S,T,S -> but 5 letters? ""POSTS"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning stakes.
- Positions: P(1), O(2), S(3), T(4), S(5)
- Now, O is at position 2 -> forbidden for O. S is at position 3 and also at 5, but the feedback only says S is present and not at position 4. It doesn't say anything about other positions. However, we must avoid O at position 2. So post is O at 2 -> invalid.

We need a word where O is not in position 2, S not in position 4, T not in position 5.

Let me try to list positions:

We have O, S, T to place, each must be in a new position.

Possible positions for O: 1,3,4,5 (but not 2)
For S: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
For T: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

But they must be in a single word, so we need to assign positions to O, S, T and also two more letters.

Also, since S and T are present, and O, we have 3 known letters.

Now, we don't know if there is another O or something? But so far only one O indicated? But feedback doesn't say multiple. We have to be cautious.

In feedback, when a letter is repeated, it might be handled differently, but in this case we haven't encountered repetition.

Let me try to think of words:

- ""stomp"" -> but M is excluded. We cannot use M.

- ""stow"" is only 4 letters. We need 5.

- ""spots"": S, P, O, T, S -> but two S's? Let me see:
  Positions: S(1), P(2), O(3), T(4), S(5)
  Check against constraints:
    O at position 3: allowed (not position 2)
    S at position 1 and 5: allowed (only forbidden for S is position 4)
    T at position 4: allowed (forbidden only position 5 for T)

So ""spots"" might be a candidate. But note we have two S's. The feedback from ""moist"" had S present, but it didn't specify the count. It could be one or more.

However, we must avoid excluded letters: S, P, O, T, S -> letters: S, P, O, T. None of these are in the excluded set (C,R,A,N,E,M,I). So it's okay.

But let's check: the word ""spots"" has two S's. We don't know if the secret word has two S's or not. But it could be possible.

Alternatively, ""stout"": S, T, O, U, T -> two T's? Letters: S, T, O, U, T -> U is allowed? U is not excluded. Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), U(4), T(5)
Now constraints:
  O at 3: allowed (not 2)
  S at 1: allowed (not restricted except not position 4? and 1 is okay)
  T at 2 and 5: but T at 5 is forbidden? We cannot have T at position 5? Yes, so T at position 5 is not allowed. So ""stout"" has T at position 5 -> invalid.

""joust"": J, O, U, S, T -> positions: J(1), O(2) -> O cannot be at position 2 -> invalid.

""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> O at position 2 -> invalid.

""focus"": F, O, C, U, S -> but C is excluded! Cannot use C.

""fluid"": F, L, U, I, D -> but I is excluded.

""fonts"": F, O, N, T, S -> but N is excluded from first feedback -> N(x) so N not in word.

""knots"": K, N, O, T, S -> N excluded.

We need to avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I. So avoid any word with these.

Back to ""spots"": it seemed okay? Letters: S, P, O, T, S -> no excluded letters.

Positions: 
- S at 1: okay
- P at 2: not known, but allowed
- O at 3: okay (not position 2)
- T at 4: okay (forbidden is only position 5 for T)
- S at 5: okay

So ""spots"" meets the constraints.

Another candidate: ""posts"" is P,O,S,T,S -> same as ""spots"" but rearranged.

""posts"": P(1), O(2), S(3), T(4), S(5)
But O is at position 2 -> forbidden. So not allowed.

So ""posts"" has O at position 2 -> invalid.

But ""spots"" has S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 4, S at 5 -> no O at 2.

What about ""boots""? B,O,O,T,S? That has two O's? Positions: B(1),O(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)
O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.

""costs""? But C and S? C excluded.

""tousy""? Not a common word.

""stops"": S, T, O, P, S -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),P(4),S(5)
Check:
  O at 3: ok
  S at 1 and 5: ok (not position 4)
  T at 2: ok (only forbidden position for T is position 5)
Also, P at 4: we don't have any constraint against P at 4? So okay.

So ""stops"" seems valid? But it has S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3, P at 4, S at 5.

We need to compare with feedback: we know S is not at position 4, and T not at position 5, which is satisfied here.

Similarly, ""spots"" also: S(1),P(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)

Now, both ""spots"" and ""stops"" are candidates.

But note: we also have O, which is known to be present, and in ""stops"" O is at position 3, and in ""spots"" also at position 3.

Both have S at the beginning and end.

Other candidate: ""plots""? P,L,O,T,S -> positions: P(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)
Again, O at 3, T at 4, S at 5 -> S at position 5 is allowed? Only forbidden for S is position 4, so position 5 is okay.

But S is at position 5, not 4.

Similarly, all constraints satisfied.

Another candidate: ""shots"": S,H,O,T,S -> positions: S(1),H(2),O(3),T(4),S(5) -> same pattern.

All these seem okay? But we need to choose one.

We also can consider ""south"" or something? ""south"": S,O,U,T,H -> positions: S(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5)
But O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.

""fists""? No O.

We must include O, S, T.

So ""sloth"": S,L,O,T,H -> positions: S(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),H(5)
Again, L at position 2? That's allowed? O at 3, T at 4, H at 5: no constraint violated.

But ""sloth"" avoids excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I -> L,H,O,S,T are not excluded.

Yes.

Now, among these candidates: ""spots"", ""stops"", ""plots"", ""shots"", ""sloth"", etc.

Which one to choose? Since we have O, S, T as known, and we are trying to locate their positions, and test new letters.

We might want to test letters that have not been used yet to gain more information.

From first guess: we used C,R,A,N,E -> all absent.
Second guess: M,O,I,S,T -> O,S,T present, M,I absent.

So far, the letters we have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T.

Therefore, new letters would be: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

In ""spots"": it uses S,O,T (known present) and P (new) and again S.

Similarly, ""stops"": same letters: S,O,T,P and S.

""plots"": P,L,O,T,S -> S,O,T known, and P,L new.

""shots"": S,H,O,T,S -> S,O,T known, and H new.

""sloth"": S,L,O,T,H -> S,O,T known, and L,H new.

To maximize information, we should choose a word with as many new letters as possible, but since S,O,T are already present, we can test different positions and new letters.

Ideally, we cover new consonants in positions that might be correct.

Given that, ""plots"" uses two new letters: P and L.

""shots"" uses one new letter: H.

""sloth"" uses two: L and H.

""spots"" uses one new letter: P.

So words like ""plots"" or ""sloth"" are better because they test two new letters.

But in ""plots"": 
- Position 1: P (new)
- Position 2: L (new)
- Position 3: O (we know O is present, but we are testing if position 3 is correct for O? Not exactly, but if we get a ✓ for O at position 3, that's good; but if not, we know it's not at position 3 either)

Similarly with ""sloth"".

Another candidate: ""gloats""? But that would be 6 letters? ""gloat"" is 5? ""GLOAT"" is 5: G,L,O,A,T -> A is excluded! Cannot.

""blots"": B,L,O,T,S -> letters: B,L,O,T,S -> none excluded? Positions: B(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)

So ""blots"" is also a candidate: B and L new.

Now, let me list the candidates:
- spots: uses P (new), and S,O,T at positions: S1, O3, T4
- stops: S1,T2,O3,P4,S5 -> T at position 2? And P at 4? Let me not use stops because T is at position 2 which is new to test.
- but stops: letters S,T,O,P,S -> same as spots but different arrangement? Actually stops: S,T,O,P,S -> positions: S at1, T at2, O at3, P at4, S at5 -> so placing T at 2 and P at4.

Similarly, plots: positions P1,L2,O3,T4,S5 -> O and T fixed at 3 and 4? But we don't know if they are correct.

Actually, all these have O at position 3 and T at position 4? In plots, O at3, T at4? Yes.

But the feedback only said that O is not at position 2, but it could be at position 1,3,4,5? Similarly for others.

But in candidates like ""plots"", we are placing O at position 3. If the feedback shows ✓ for O, then it's correct; otherwise not.

I think it's fine.

But to be systematic, since O was in position 2 and was wrong, and now we try position 3.

Similarly, S was in position 4 and wrong, now in ""plots"" S is at position 5. T was in position 5 and wrong, now at position 4? Let's see:

In ""moist"":
   Position 4: S was wrong -> so S not at 4.
   Position 5: T was wrong -> so T not at 5.

In ""plots"":
   S is at position 5 -> not position 4, so okay.
   T is at position 4 -> not position 5, so okay.

But position 4 for T: now we don't know.

Similarly, O at position 3.

Also, we are testing L at position 2 and P at position 1.

I think ""plots"" is a good word.

Another candidate: ""fonts"" but N excluded -> invalid.

""pouts"": P,O,U,T,S -> positions: P1,O2,U3,T4,S5 -> but O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.

So, ""plots"" seems solid.

Let me confirm if ""plots"" is a valid word: yes, meaning small pieces of ground? Or schemes.

Therefore, I'll go with ""plots"".

Guessed word: plots

So the response should be: <guess>plots</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E excluded).
- ""moist"" showed:
  - M and I absent (so M and I are excluded).
  - O, S, and T present but in wrong positions (so O not in position 2, S not in position 4, T not in position 5).

The secret word must contain O, S, T (but not in their guessed positions) and avoid C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

For the next guess:
- Must include O, S, T properly placed (O ≠ pos2, S ≠ pos4, T ≠ pos5).
- Use new letters to test uncovered possibilities.
- Avoid excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

Optimal word choice: ""PLOTS""
- P and L are new letters (not tested before).
- Positions:
  - O in position 3 (not 2) → valid.
  - S in position 5 (not 4) → valid.
  - T in position 4 (not 5) → valid.
- Valid 5-letter word (e.g., defined as small areas or schemes).
- Maximizes information by introducing two new letters (P and L) while satisfying known constraints.

<guess>plots</guess>",plots,"We have two guesses and their feedback:

1. ""crane"": All letters are incorrect (x). So the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.

2. ""moist"": 
   - M: x (not in the word at all)
   - O: - (in the word but wrong position)
   - I: x (not in the word)
   - S: - (in the word but wrong position)
   - T: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from ""moist"":
- O, S, T are in the word but in the wrong positions.
- M and I are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word contains O, S, T, and does not contain M, I, and also not C,R,A,N,E from the first guess.

Also, since O, S, T are present but not in the positions they were in ""moist"":
- Position 2: O is incorrect -> so O is not in position 2.
- Position 4: S is incorrect -> so S is not in position 4.
- Position 5: T is incorrect -> so T is not in position 5.

Moreover, from the first guess, we know that C, R, A, N, E, M, I are all absent.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Contains O, S, T (since we know they are in the word).
- Does not contain any of: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.
- And we must place O, S, T in positions that are not their original positions from ""moist"":
  - O cannot be in position 2.
  - S cannot be in position 4.
  - T cannot be in position 5.

Additionally, we need to include two more letters (since it's a 5-letter word) that are not in the excluded list.

We also know the positions from ""moist"":
- Position 1: M (wrong) -> we must avoid M and since it's absent, we cannot use M.
- Position 2: O (wrong position) -> we know O is present, but we must not put O at position 2 again, and we know it must be somewhere else.
- Position 3: I (absent) -> avoid I.
- Position 4: S (wrong position) -> so S is not at 4.
- Position 5: T (wrong position) -> so T is not at 5.

Now, let's list the known present letters: O, S, T.

We need to choose a word that has O, S, T, and two more letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I. So 7 letters excluded.

Available letters: all others: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes O, S, T and two others from the available set.

Moreover, we should avoid placing O at position 2, S at position 4, T at position 5.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let me try to think of words that contain O, S, T.

Some ideas:
- ""ghost"" -> but G,H,O,S,T. But O is at position 3, S at 4, T at 5? 
  - However, in ""moist"", we have S at position 4 and T at position 5 and they were marked wrong position. So in ""ghost"":
    - Position 4: S (but we cannot have S at position 4 because feedback said S is in the word but not at position 4).
    - Similarly, T is at position 5 which is not allowed.
  - So ""ghost"" is invalid because S and T are in the forbidden positions.

Alternatively, ""boost"" -> B,O,O,S,T. But two O's? Let's check:
  - Positions: B(1), O(2), O(3), S(4), T(5)
  - But O is at position 2 -> we cannot have O at position 2 (from ""moist"" feedback). Also S at 4 and T at 5 are forbidden. So not good.

""posts"" -> P,O,S,T,S -> but 5 letters? ""POSTS"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning stakes.
- Positions: P(1), O(2), S(3), T(4), S(5)
- Now, O is at position 2 -> forbidden for O. S is at position 3 and also at 5, but the feedback only says S is present and not at position 4. It doesn't say anything about other positions. However, we must avoid O at position 2. So post is O at 2 -> invalid.

We need a word where O is not in position 2, S not in position 4, T not in position 5.

Let me try to list positions:

We have O, S, T to place, each must be in a new position.

Possible positions for O: 1,3,4,5 (but not 2)
For S: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
For T: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

But they must be in a single word, so we need to assign positions to O, S, T and also two more letters.

Also, since S and T are present, and O, we have 3 known letters.

Now, we don't know if there is another O or something? But so far only one O indicated? But feedback doesn't say multiple. We have to be cautious.

In feedback, when a letter is repeated, it might be handled differently, but in this case we haven't encountered repetition.

Let me try to think of words:

- ""stomp"" -> but M is excluded. We cannot use M.

- ""stow"" is only 4 letters. We need 5.

- ""spots"": S, P, O, T, S -> but two S's? Let me see:
  Positions: S(1), P(2), O(3), T(4), S(5)
  Check against constraints:
    O at position 3: allowed (not position 2)
    S at position 1 and 5: allowed (only forbidden for S is position 4)
    T at position 4: allowed (forbidden only position 5 for T)

So ""spots"" might be a candidate. But note we have two S's. The feedback from ""moist"" had S present, but it didn't specify the count. It could be one or more.

However, we must avoid excluded letters: S, P, O, T, S -> letters: S, P, O, T. None of these are in the excluded set (C,R,A,N,E,M,I). So it's okay.

But let's check: the word ""spots"" has two S's. We don't know if the secret word has two S's or not. But it could be possible.

Alternatively, ""stout"": S, T, O, U, T -> two T's? Letters: S, T, O, U, T -> U is allowed? U is not excluded. Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), U(4), T(5)
Now constraints:
  O at 3: allowed (not 2)
  S at 1: allowed (not restricted except not position 4? and 1 is okay)
  T at 2 and 5: but T at 5 is forbidden? We cannot have T at position 5? Yes, so T at position 5 is not allowed. So ""stout"" has T at position 5 -> invalid.

""joust"": J, O, U, S, T -> positions: J(1), O(2) -> O cannot be at position 2 -> invalid.

""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> O at position 2 -> invalid.

""focus"": F, O, C, U, S -> but C is excluded! Cannot use C.

""fluid"": F, L, U, I, D -> but I is excluded.

""fonts"": F, O, N, T, S -> but N is excluded from first feedback -> N(x) so N not in word.

""knots"": K, N, O, T, S -> N excluded.

We need to avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I. So avoid any word with these.

Back to ""spots"": it seemed okay? Letters: S, P, O, T, S -> no excluded letters.

Positions: 
- S at 1: okay
- P at 2: not known, but allowed
- O at 3: okay (not position 2)
- T at 4: okay (forbidden is only position 5 for T)
- S at 5: okay

So ""spots"" meets the constraints.

Another candidate: ""posts"" is P,O,S,T,S -> same as ""spots"" but rearranged.

""posts"": P(1), O(2), S(3), T(4), S(5)
But O is at position 2 -> forbidden. So not allowed.

So ""posts"" has O at position 2 -> invalid.

But ""spots"" has S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 4, S at 5 -> no O at 2.

What about ""boots""? B,O,O,T,S? That has two O's? Positions: B(1),O(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)
O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.

""costs""? But C and S? C excluded.

""tousy""? Not a common word.

""stops"": S, T, O, P, S -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),P(4),S(5)
Check:
  O at 3: ok
  S at 1 and 5: ok (not position 4)
  T at 2: ok (only forbidden position for T is position 5)
Also, P at 4: we don't have any constraint against P at 4? So okay.

So ""stops"" seems valid? But it has S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3, P at 4, S at 5.

We need to compare with feedback: we know S is not at position 4, and T not at position 5, which is satisfied here.

Similarly, ""spots"" also: S(1),P(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)

Now, both ""spots"" and ""stops"" are candidates.

But note: we also have O, which is known to be present, and in ""stops"" O is at position 3, and in ""spots"" also at position 3.

Both have S at the beginning and end.

Other candidate: ""plots""? P,L,O,T,S -> positions: P(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)
Again, O at 3, T at 4, S at 5 -> S at position 5 is allowed? Only forbidden for S is position 4, so position 5 is okay.

But S is at position 5, not 4.

Similarly, all constraints satisfied.

Another candidate: ""shots"": S,H,O,T,S -> positions: S(1),H(2),O(3),T(4),S(5) -> same pattern.

All these seem okay? But we need to choose one.

We also can consider ""south"" or something? ""south"": S,O,U,T,H -> positions: S(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5)
But O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.

""fists""? No O.

We must include O, S, T.

So ""sloth"": S,L,O,T,H -> positions: S(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),H(5)
Again, L at position 2? That's allowed? O at 3, T at 4, H at 5: no constraint violated.

But ""sloth"" avoids excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I -> L,H,O,S,T are not excluded.

Yes.

Now, among these candidates: ""spots"", ""stops"", ""plots"", ""shots"", ""sloth"", etc.

Which one to choose? Since we have O, S, T as known, and we are trying to locate their positions, and test new letters.

We might want to test letters that have not been used yet to gain more information.

From first guess: we used C,R,A,N,E -> all absent.
Second guess: M,O,I,S,T -> O,S,T present, M,I absent.

So far, the letters we have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T.

Therefore, new letters would be: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

In ""spots"": it uses S,O,T (known present) and P (new) and again S.

Similarly, ""stops"": same letters: S,O,T,P and S.

""plots"": P,L,O,T,S -> S,O,T known, and P,L new.

""shots"": S,H,O,T,S -> S,O,T known, and H new.

""sloth"": S,L,O,T,H -> S,O,T known, and L,H new.

To maximize information, we should choose a word with as many new letters as possible, but since S,O,T are already present, we can test different positions and new letters.

Ideally, we cover new consonants in positions that might be correct.

Given that, ""plots"" uses two new letters: P and L.

""shots"" uses one new letter: H.

""sloth"" uses two: L and H.

""spots"" uses one new letter: P.

So words like ""plots"" or ""sloth"" are better because they test two new letters.

But in ""plots"": 
- Position 1: P (new)
- Position 2: L (new)
- Position 3: O (we know O is present, but we are testing if position 3 is correct for O? Not exactly, but if we get a ✓ for O at position 3, that's good; but if not, we know it's not at position 3 either)

Similarly with ""sloth"".

Another candidate: ""gloats""? But that would be 6 letters? ""gloat"" is 5? ""GLOAT"" is 5: G,L,O,A,T -> A is excluded! Cannot.

""blots"": B,L,O,T,S -> letters: B,L,O,T,S -> none excluded? Positions: B(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)

So ""blots"" is also a candidate: B and L new.

Now, let me list the candidates:
- spots: uses P (new), and S,O,T at positions: S1, O3, T4
- stops: S1,T2,O3,P4,S5 -> T at position 2? And P at 4? Let me not use stops because T is at position 2 which is new to test.
- but stops: letters S,T,O,P,S -> same as spots but different arrangement? Actually stops: S,T,O,P,S -> positions: S at1, T at2, O at3, P at4, S at5 -> so placing T at 2 and P at4.

Similarly, plots: positions P1,L2,O3,T4,S5 -> O and T fixed at 3 and 4? But we don't know if they are correct.

Actually, all these have O at position 3 and T at position 4? In plots, O at3, T at4? Yes.

But the feedback only said that O is not at position 2, but it could be at position 1,3,4,5? Similarly for others.

But in candidates like ""plots"", we are placing O at position 3. If the feedback shows ✓ for O, then it's correct; otherwise not.

I think it's fine.

But to be systematic, since O was in position 2 and was wrong, and now we try position 3.

Similarly, S was in position 4 and wrong, now in ""plots"" S is at position 5. T was in position 5 and wrong, now at position 4? Let's see:

In ""moist"":
   Position 4: S was wrong -> so S not at 4.
   Position 5: T was wrong -> so T not at 5.

In ""plots"":
   S is at position 5 -> not position 4, so okay.
   T is at position 4 -> not position 5, so okay.

But position 4 for T: now we don't know.

Similarly, O at position 3.

Also, we are testing L at position 2 and P at position 1.

I think ""plots"" is a good word.

Another candidate: ""fonts"" but N excluded -> invalid.

""pouts"": P,O,U,T,S -> positions: P1,O2,U3,T4,S5 -> but O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.

So, ""plots"" seems solid.

Let me confirm if ""plots"" is a valid word: yes, meaning small pieces of ground? Or schemes.

Therefore, I'll go with ""plots"".

Guessed word: plots

So the response should be: <guess>plots</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E excluded).
- ""moist"" showed:
  - M and I absent (so M and I are excluded).
  - O, S, and T present but in wrong positions (so O not in position 2, S not in position 4, T not in position 5).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,STOOD,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback that for the first guess ""crane"", all letters are incorrect (x). 
 This means that the secret word contains none of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Therefore, we must choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain any of these letters.

 We need to avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words without these letters.

 Some common starting letters might be: S, T, B, L, P, etc.

 We can try words like ""sight"", ""plumb"", ""dough"", etc. But let's check:

 We must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's try to form a word with other common letters.

 Consider: S, T, L, I, O, U, M, P, B, D, G, H, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"" but let's check the letters: S, L, O, T, H -> none of the forbidden letters.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" has P, I, O, U, S -> also safe.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Since we have eliminated 5 letters, we have 21 left. We should try to use 5 new letters that are common.

 Let's list the frequency of letters in English words (without C, R, A, N, E). The most common remaining letters are: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 We can try ""TOILS"" or ""STOMP"" or ""PILOT"".

 However, note that we are in the second guess and we have no correct letters so far. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me choose ""SPLIT"": 
   S, P, L, I, T -> none of the forbidden letters (C,R,A,N,E). 

 But wait, is ""SPLIT"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is also a good candidate: M, O, I, S, T.

 Another one: ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L -> but we might want to avoid less common letters.

 Since we are early in the game, we should focus on common letters.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has common letters and we haven't tried M, O, I, S, T.

 But note: we are avoiding C,R,A,N,E, and MOIST doesn't have any of those.

 So, I'll go with ""MOIST"".

 However, let me double-check: 
   M: not in {C,R,A,N,E}
   O: not in
   I: not in
   S: not in
   T: not in

 Yes.

 Alternatively, we could use ""PIOUS"" but that has U which is less common. Or ""BUMPY"" but that has B,U,M,P,Y and Y is also less common.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""MOIST"".After the first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters being incorrect (C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word), I need to choose a new word that avoids these letters entirely. The new guess should maximize coverage of common unused letters to gather more information. 

I considered words like ""sight,"" ""plumb,"" and ""dough,"" but settled on ""moist"" because:
- It uses common letters (M, O, I, S, T) not yet tested.
- None of its letters (M, O, I, S, T) overlap with the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- It covers vowels (O, I) and frequent consonants (M, S, T), increasing the chance of hits.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

1. ""crane"": All letters are incorrect (x). So the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.

2. ""moist"": 
   - M: x (not in the word at all)
   - O: - (in the word but wrong position)
   - I: x (not in the word)
   - S: - (in the word but wrong position)
   - T: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from ""moist"":
- O, S, T are in the word but in the wrong positions.
- M and I are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word contains O, S, T, and does not contain M, I, and also not C,R,A,N,E from the first guess.

Also, since O, S, T are present but not in the positions they were in ""moist"":
- Position 2: O is incorrect -> so O is not in position 2.
- Position 4: S is incorrect -> so S is not in position 4.
- Position 5: T is incorrect -> so T is not in position 5.

Moreover, from the first guess, we know that C, R, A, N, E, M, I are all absent.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Contains O, S, T (since we know they are in the word).
- Does not contain any of: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.
- And we must place O, S, T in positions that are not their original positions from ""moist"":
  - O cannot be in position 2.
  - S cannot be in position 4.
  - T cannot be in position 5.

Additionally, we need to include two more letters (since it's a 5-letter word) that are not in the excluded list.

We also know the positions from ""moist"":
- Position 1: M (wrong) -> we must avoid M and since it's absent, we cannot use M.
- Position 2: O (wrong position) -> we know O is present, but we must not put O at position 2 again, and we know it must be somewhere else.
- Position 3: I (absent) -> avoid I.
- Position 4: S (wrong position) -> so S is not at 4.
- Position 5: T (wrong position) -> so T is not at 5.

Now, let's list the known present letters: O, S, T.

We need to choose a word that has O, S, T, and two more letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I. So 7 letters excluded.

Available letters: all others: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes O, S, T and two others from the available set.

Moreover, we should avoid placing O at position 2, S at position 4, T at position 5.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let me try to think of words that contain O, S, T.

Some ideas:
- ""ghost"" -> but G,H,O,S,T. But O is at position 3, S at 4, T at 5? 
  - However, in ""moist"", we have S at position 4 and T at position 5 and they were marked wrong position. So in ""ghost"":
    - Position 4: S (but we cannot have S at position 4 because feedback said S is in the word but not at position 4).
    - Similarly, T is at position 5 which is not allowed.
  - So ""ghost"" is invalid because S and T are in the forbidden positions.

Alternatively, ""boost"" -> B,O,O,S,T. But two O's? Let's check:
  - Positions: B(1), O(2), O(3), S(4), T(5)
  - But O is at position 2 -> we cannot have O at position 2 (from ""moist"" feedback). Also S at 4 and T at 5 are forbidden. So not good.

""posts"" -> P,O,S,T,S -> but 5 letters? ""POSTS"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning stakes.
- Positions: P(1), O(2), S(3), T(4), S(5)
- Now, O is at position 2 -> forbidden for O. S is at position 3 and also at 5, but the feedback only says S is present and not at position 4. It doesn't say anything about other positions. However, we must avoid O at position 2. So post is O at 2 -> invalid.

We need a word where O is not in position 2, S not in position 4, T not in position 5.

Let me try to list positions:

We have O, S, T to place, each must be in a new position.

Possible positions for O: 1,3,4,5 (but not 2)
For S: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
For T: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

But they must be in a single word, so we need to assign positions to O, S, T and also two more letters.

Also, since S and T are present, and O, we have 3 known letters.

Now, we don't know if there is another O or something? But so far only one O indicated? But feedback doesn't say multiple. We have to be cautious.

In feedback, when a letter is repeated, it might be handled differently, but in this case we haven't encountered repetition.

Let me try to think of words:

- ""stomp"" -> but M is excluded. We cannot use M.

- ""stow"" is only 4 letters. We need 5.

- ""spots"": S, P, O, T, S -> but two S's? Let me see:
  Positions: S(1), P(2), O(3), T(4), S(5)
  Check against constraints:
    O at position 3: allowed (not position 2)
    S at position 1 and 5: allowed (only forbidden for S is position 4)
    T at position 4: allowed (forbidden only position 5 for T)

So ""spots"" might be a candidate. But note we have two S's. The feedback from ""moist"" had S present, but it didn't specify the count. It could be one or more.

However, we must avoid excluded letters: S, P, O, T, S -> letters: S, P, O, T. None of these are in the excluded set (C,R,A,N,E,M,I). So it's okay.

But let's check: the word ""spots"" has two S's. We don't know if the secret word has two S's or not. But it could be possible.

Alternatively, ""stout"": S, T, O, U, T -> two T's? Letters: S, T, O, U, T -> U is allowed? U is not excluded. Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), U(4), T(5)
Now constraints:
  O at 3: allowed (not 2)
  S at 1: allowed (not restricted except not position 4? and 1 is okay)
  T at 2 and 5: but T at 5 is forbidden? We cannot have T at position 5? Yes, so T at position 5 is not allowed. So ""stout"" has T at position 5 -> invalid.

""joust"": J, O, U, S, T -> positions: J(1), O(2) -> O cannot be at position 2 -> invalid.

""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> O at position 2 -> invalid.

""focus"": F, O, C, U, S -> but C is excluded! Cannot use C.

""fluid"": F, L, U, I, D -> but I is excluded.

""fonts"": F, O, N, T, S -> but N is excluded from first feedback -> N(x) so N not in word.

""knots"": K, N, O, T, S -> N excluded.

We need to avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I. So avoid any word with these.

Back to ""spots"": it seemed okay? Letters: S, P, O, T, S -> no excluded letters.

Positions: 
- S at 1: okay
- P at 2: not known, but allowed
- O at 3: okay (not position 2)
- T at 4: okay (forbidden is only position 5 for T)
- S at 5: okay

So ""spots"" meets the constraints.

Another candidate: ""posts"" is P,O,S,T,S -> same as ""spots"" but rearranged.

""posts"": P(1), O(2), S(3), T(4), S(5)
But O is at position 2 -> forbidden. So not allowed.

So ""posts"" has O at position 2 -> invalid.

But ""spots"" has S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 4, S at 5 -> no O at 2.

What about ""boots""? B,O,O,T,S? That has two O's? Positions: B(1),O(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)
O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.

""costs""? But C and S? C excluded.

""tousy""? Not a common word.

""stops"": S, T, O, P, S -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),P(4),S(5)
Check:
  O at 3: ok
  S at 1 and 5: ok (not position 4)
  T at 2: ok (only forbidden position for T is position 5)
Also, P at 4: we don't have any constraint against P at 4? So okay.

So ""stops"" seems valid? But it has S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3, P at 4, S at 5.

We need to compare with feedback: we know S is not at position 4, and T not at position 5, which is satisfied here.

Similarly, ""spots"" also: S(1),P(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)

Now, both ""spots"" and ""stops"" are candidates.

But note: we also have O, which is known to be present, and in ""stops"" O is at position 3, and in ""spots"" also at position 3.

Both have S at the beginning and end.

Other candidate: ""plots""? P,L,O,T,S -> positions: P(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)
Again, O at 3, T at 4, S at 5 -> S at position 5 is allowed? Only forbidden for S is position 4, so position 5 is okay.

But S is at position 5, not 4.

Similarly, all constraints satisfied.

Another candidate: ""shots"": S,H,O,T,S -> positions: S(1),H(2),O(3),T(4),S(5) -> same pattern.

All these seem okay? But we need to choose one.

We also can consider ""south"" or something? ""south"": S,O,U,T,H -> positions: S(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5)
But O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.

""fists""? No O.

We must include O, S, T.

So ""sloth"": S,L,O,T,H -> positions: S(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),H(5)
Again, L at position 2? That's allowed? O at 3, T at 4, H at 5: no constraint violated.

But ""sloth"" avoids excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I -> L,H,O,S,T are not excluded.

Yes.

Now, among these candidates: ""spots"", ""stops"", ""plots"", ""shots"", ""sloth"", etc.

Which one to choose? Since we have O, S, T as known, and we are trying to locate their positions, and test new letters.

We might want to test letters that have not been used yet to gain more information.

From first guess: we used C,R,A,N,E -> all absent.
Second guess: M,O,I,S,T -> O,S,T present, M,I absent.

So far, the letters we have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T.

Therefore, new letters would be: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

In ""spots"": it uses S,O,T (known present) and P (new) and again S.

Similarly, ""stops"": same letters: S,O,T,P and S.

""plots"": P,L,O,T,S -> S,O,T known, and P,L new.

""shots"": S,H,O,T,S -> S,O,T known, and H new.

""sloth"": S,L,O,T,H -> S,O,T known, and L,H new.

To maximize information, we should choose a word with as many new letters as possible, but since S,O,T are already present, we can test different positions and new letters.

Ideally, we cover new consonants in positions that might be correct.

Given that, ""plots"" uses two new letters: P and L.

""shots"" uses one new letter: H.

""sloth"" uses two: L and H.

""spots"" uses one new letter: P.

So words like ""plots"" or ""sloth"" are better because they test two new letters.

But in ""plots"": 
- Position 1: P (new)
- Position 2: L (new)
- Position 3: O (we know O is present, but we are testing if position 3 is correct for O? Not exactly, but if we get a ✓ for O at position 3, that's good; but if not, we know it's not at position 3 either)

Similarly with ""sloth"".

Another candidate: ""gloats""? But that would be 6 letters? ""gloat"" is 5? ""GLOAT"" is 5: G,L,O,A,T -> A is excluded! Cannot.

""blots"": B,L,O,T,S -> letters: B,L,O,T,S -> none excluded? Positions: B(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)

So ""blots"" is also a candidate: B and L new.

Now, let me list the candidates:
- spots: uses P (new), and S,O,T at positions: S1, O3, T4
- stops: S1,T2,O3,P4,S5 -> T at position 2? And P at 4? Let me not use stops because T is at position 2 which is new to test.
- but stops: letters S,T,O,P,S -> same as spots but different arrangement? Actually stops: S,T,O,P,S -> positions: S at1, T at2, O at3, P at4, S at5 -> so placing T at 2 and P at4.

Similarly, plots: positions P1,L2,O3,T4,S5 -> O and T fixed at 3 and 4? But we don't know if they are correct.

Actually, all these have O at position 3 and T at position 4? In plots, O at3, T at4? Yes.

But the feedback only said that O is not at position 2, but it could be at position 1,3,4,5? Similarly for others.

But in candidates like ""plots"", we are placing O at position 3. If the feedback shows ✓ for O, then it's correct; otherwise not.

I think it's fine.

But to be systematic, since O was in position 2 and was wrong, and now we try position 3.

Similarly, S was in position 4 and wrong, now in ""plots"" S is at position 5. T was in position 5 and wrong, now at position 4? Let's see:

In ""moist"":
   Position 4: S was wrong -> so S not at 4.
   Position 5: T was wrong -> so T not at 5.

In ""plots"":
   S is at position 5 -> not position 4, so okay.
   T is at position 4 -> not position 5, so okay.

But position 4 for T: now we don't know.

Similarly, O at position 3.

Also, we are testing L at position 2 and P at position 1.

I think ""plots"" is a good word.

Another candidate: ""fonts"" but N excluded -> invalid.

""pouts"": P,O,U,T,S -> positions: P1,O2,U3,T4,S5 -> but O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.

So, ""plots"" seems solid.

Let me confirm if ""plots"" is a valid word: yes, meaning small pieces of ground? Or schemes.

Therefore, I'll go with ""plots"".

Guessed word: plots

So the response should be: <guess>plots</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E excluded).
- ""moist"" showed:
  - M and I absent (so M and I are excluded).
  - O, S, and T present but in wrong positions (so O not in position 2, S not in position 4, T not in position 5).

The secret word must contain O, S, T (but not in their guessed positions) and avoid C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

For the next guess:
- Must include O, S, T properly placed (O ≠ pos2, S ≠ pos4, T ≠ pos5).
- Use new letters to test uncovered possibilities.
- Avoid excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

Optimal word choice: ""PLOTS""
- P and L are new letters (not tested before).
- Positions:
  - O in position 3 (not 2) → valid.
  - S in position 5 (not 4) → valid.
  - T in position 4 (not 5) → valid.
- Valid 5-letter word (e.g., defined as small areas or schemes).
- Maximizes information by introducing two new letters (P and L) while satisfying known constraints.

The new guess should maximize coverage of common unused letters to gather more information. \n\nI considered words like ""sight,"" ""plumb,"" and ""dough,"" but settled on ""moist"" because:\n- It uses common letters (M, O, I, S, T) not yet tested.\n- None of its letters (M, O, I, S, T) overlap with the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).\n- It covers vowels (O, I) and frequent consonants (M, S, T), increasing the chance of hits.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\n1. ""crane"": All letters are incorrect (x). So the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.\n\n2. ""moist"": \n   - M: x (not in the word at all)\n   - O: - (in the word but wrong position)\n   - I: x (not in the word)\n   - S: - (in the word but wrong position)\n   - T: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, from ""moist"":\n- O, S, T are in the word but in the wrong positions.\n- M and I are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, the secret word contains O, S, T, and does not contain M, I, and also not C,R,A,N,E from the first guess.\n\nAlso, since O, S, T are present but not in the positions they were in ""moist"":\n- Position 2: O is incorrect -> so O is not in position 2.\n- Position 4: S is incorrect -> so S is not in position 4.\n- Position 5: T is incorrect -> so T is not in position 5.\n\nMoreover, from the first guess, we know that C, R, A, N, E, M, I are all absent.\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that:\n- Contains O, S, T (since we know they are in the word).\n- Does not contain any of: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.\n- And we must place O, S, T in positions that are not their original positions from ""moist"":\n  - O cannot be in position 2.\n  - S cannot be in position 4.\n  - T cannot be in position 5.\n\nAdditionally, we need to include two more letters (since it\'s a 5-letter word) that are not in the excluded list.\n\nWe also know the positions from ""moist"":\n- Position 1: M (wrong) -> we must avoid M and since it\'s absent, we cannot use M.\n- Position 2: O (wrong position) -> we know O is present, but we must not put O at position 2 again, and we know it must be somewhere else.\n- Position 3: I (absent) -> avoid I.\n- Position 4: S (wrong position) -> so S is not at 4.\n- Position 5: T (wrong position) -> so T is not at 5.\n\nNow, let\'s list the known present letters: O, S, T.\n\nWe need to choose a word that has O, S, T, and two more letters that are not excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I. So 7 letters excluded.\n\nAvailable letters: all others: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to form a 5-letter word that includes O, S, T and two others from the available set.\n\nMoreover, we should avoid placing O at position 2, S at position 4, T at position 5.\n\nAlso, note that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nLet me try to think of words that contain O, S, T.\n\nSome ideas:\n- ""ghost"" -> but G,H,O,S,T. But O is at position 3, S at 4, T at 5? \n  - However, in ""moist"", we have S at position 4 and T at position 5 and they were marked wrong position. So in ""ghost"":\n    - Position 4: S (but we cannot have S at position 4 because feedback said S is in the word but not at position 4).\n    - Similarly, T is at position 5 which is not allowed.\n  - So ""ghost"" is invalid because S and T are in the forbidden positions.\n\nAlternatively, ""boost"" -> B,O,O,S,T. But two O\'s? Let\'s check:\n  - Positions: B(1), O(2), O(3), S(4), T(5)\n  - But O is at position 2 -> we cannot have O at position 2 (from ""moist"" feedback). Also S at 4 and T at 5 are forbidden. So not good.\n\n""posts"" -> P,O,S,T,S -> but 5 letters? ""POSTS"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning stakes.\n- Positions: P(1), O(2), S(3), T(4), S(5)\n- Now, O is at position 2 -> forbidden for O. S is at position 3 and also at 5, but the feedback only says S is present and not at position 4. It doesn\'t say anything about other positions. However, we must avoid O at position 2. So post is O at 2 -> invalid.\n\nWe need a word where O is not in position 2, S not in position 4, T not in position 5.\n\nLet me try to list positions:\n\nWe have O, S, T to place, each must be in a new position.\n\nPossible positions for O: 1,3,4,5 (but not 2)\nFor S: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)\nFor T: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)\n\nBut they must be in a single word, so we need to assign positions to O, S, T and also two more letters.\n\nAlso, since S and T are present, and O, we have 3 known letters.\n\nNow, we don\'t know if there is another O or something? But so far only one O indicated? But feedback doesn\'t say multiple. We have to be cautious.\n\nIn feedback, when a letter is repeated, it might be handled differently, but in this case we haven\'t encountered repetition.\n\nLet me try to think of words:\n\n- ""stomp"" -> but M is excluded. We cannot use M.\n\n- ""stow"" is only 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n- ""spots"": S, P, O, T, S -> but two S\'s? Let me see:\n  Positions: S(1), P(2), O(3), T(4), S(5)\n  Check against constraints:\n    O at position 3: allowed (not position 2)\n    S at position 1 and 5: allowed (only forbidden for S is position 4)\n    T at position 4: allowed (forbidden only position 5 for T)\n\nSo ""spots"" might be a candidate. But note we have two S\'s. The feedback from ""moist"" had S present, but it didn\'t specify the count. It could be one or more.\n\nHowever, we must avoid excluded letters: S, P, O, T, S -> letters: S, P, O, T. None of these are in the excluded set (C,R,A,N,E,M,I). So it\'s okay.\n\nBut let\'s check: the word ""spots"" has two S\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s or not. But it could be possible.\n\nAlternatively, ""stout"": S, T, O, U, T -> two T\'s? Letters: S, T, O, U, T -> U is allowed? U is not excluded. Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), U(4), T(5)\nNow constraints:\n  O at 3: allowed (not 2)\n  S at 1: allowed (not restricted except not position 4? and 1 is okay)\n  T at 2 and 5: but T at 5 is forbidden? We cannot have T at position 5? Yes, so T at position 5 is not allowed. So ""stout"" has T at position 5 -> invalid.\n\n""joust"": J, O, U, S, T -> positions: J(1), O(2) -> O cannot be at position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> O at position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""focus"": F, O, C, U, S -> but C is excluded! Cannot use C.\n\n""fluid"": F, L, U, I, D -> but I is excluded.\n\n""fonts"": F, O, N, T, S -> but N is excluded from first feedback -> N(x) so N not in word.\n\n""knots"": K, N, O, T, S -> N excluded.\n\nWe need to avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I. So avoid any word with these.\n\nBack to ""spots"": it seemed okay? Letters: S, P, O, T, S -> no excluded letters.\n\nPositions: \n- S at 1: okay\n- P at 2: not known, but allowed\n- O at 3: okay (not position 2)\n- T at 4: okay (forbidden is only position 5 for T)\n- S at 5: okay\n\nSo ""spots"" meets the constraints.\n\nAnother candidate: ""posts"" is P,O,S,T,S -> same as ""spots"" but rearranged.\n\n""posts"": P(1), O(2), S(3), T(4), S(5)\nBut O is at position 2 -> forbidden. So not allowed.\n\nSo ""posts"" has O at position 2 -> invalid.\n\nBut ""spots"" has S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 4, S at 5 -> no O at 2.\n\nWhat about ""boots""? B,O,O,T,S? That has two O\'s? Positions: B(1),O(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)\nO at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""costs""? But C and S? C excluded.\n\n""tousy""? Not a common word.\n\n""stops"": S, T, O, P, S -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),P(4),S(5)\nCheck:\n  O at 3: ok\n  S at 1 and 5: ok (not position 4)\n  T at 2: ok (only forbidden position for T is position 5)\nAlso, P at 4: we don\'t have any constraint against P at 4? So okay.\n\nSo ""stops"" seems valid? But it has S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3, P at 4, S at 5.\n\nWe need to compare with feedback: we know S is not at position 4, and T not at position 5, which is satisfied here.\n\nSimilarly, ""spots"" also: S(1),P(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)\n\nNow, both ""spots"" and ""stops"" are candidates.\n\nBut note: we also have O, which is known to be present, and in ""stops"" O is at position 3, and in ""spots"" also at position 3.\n\nBoth have S at the beginning and end.\n\nOther candidate: ""plots""? P,L,O,T,S -> positions: P(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)\nAgain, O at 3, T at 4, S at 5 -> S at position 5 is allowed? Only forbidden for S is position 4, so position 5 is okay.\n\nBut S is at position 5, not 4.\n\nSimilarly, all constraints satisfied.\n\nAnother candidate: ""shots"": S,H,O,T,S -> positions: S(1),H(2),O(3),T(4),S(5) -> same pattern.\n\nAll these seem okay? But we need to choose one.\n\nWe also can consider ""south"" or something? ""south"": S,O,U,T,H -> positions: S(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5)\nBut O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""fists""? No O.\n\nWe must include O, S, T.\n\nSo ""sloth"": S,L,O,T,H -> positions: S(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),H(5)\nAgain, L at position 2? That\'s allowed? O at 3, T at 4, H at 5: no constraint violated.\n\nBut ""sloth"" avoids excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I -> L,H,O,S,T are not excluded.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, among these candidates: ""spots"", ""stops"", ""plots"", ""shots"", ""sloth"", etc.\n\nWhich one to choose? Since we have O, S, T as known, and we are trying to locate their positions, and test new letters.\n\nWe might want to test letters that have not been used yet to gain more information.\n\nFrom first guess: we used C,R,A,N,E -> all absent.\nSecond guess: M,O,I,S,T -> O,S,T present, M,I absent.\n\nSo far, the letters we have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T.\n\nTherefore, new letters would be: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nIn ""spots"": it uses S,O,T (known present) and P (new) and again S.\n\nSimilarly, ""stops"": same letters: S,O,T,P and S.\n\n""plots"": P,L,O,T,S -> S,O,T known, and P,L new.\n\n""shots"": S,H,O,T,S -> S,O,T known, and H new.\n\n""sloth"": S,L,O,T,H -> S,O,T known, and L,H new.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word with as many new letters as possible, but since S,O,T are already present, we can test different positions and new letters.\n\nIdeally, we cover new consonants in positions that might be correct.\n\nGiven that, ""plots"" uses two new letters: P and L.\n\n""shots"" uses one new letter: H.\n\n""sloth"" uses two: L and H.\n\n""spots"" uses one new letter: P.\n\nSo words like ""plots"" or ""sloth"" are better because they test two new letters.\n\nBut in ""plots"": \n- Position 1: P (new)\n- Position 2: L (new)\n- Position 3: O (we know O is present, but we are testing if position 3 is correct for O? Not exactly, but if we get a ✓ for O at position 3, that\'s good; but if not, we know it\'s not at position 3 either)\n\nSimilarly with ""sloth"".\n\nAnother candidate: ""gloats""? But that would be 6 letters? ""gloat"" is 5? ""GLOAT"" is 5: G,L,O,A,T -> A is excluded! Cannot.\n\n""blots"": B,L,O,T,S -> letters: B,L,O,T,S -> none excluded? Positions: B(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)\n\nSo ""blots"" is also a candidate: B and L new.\n\nNow, let me list the candidates:\n- spots: uses P (new), and S,O,T at positions: S1, O3, T4\n- stops: S1,T2,O3,P4,S5 -> T at position 2? And P at 4? Let me not use stops because T is at position 2 which is new to test.\n- but stops: letters S,T,O,P,S -> same as spots but different arrangement? Actually stops: S,T,O,P,S -> positions: S at1, T at2, O at3, P at4, S at5 -> so placing T at 2 and P at4.\n\nSimilarly, plots: positions P1,L2,O3,T4,S5 -> O and T fixed at 3 and 4? But we don\'t know if they are correct.\n\nActually, all these have O at position 3 and T at position 4? In plots, O at3, T at4? Yes.\n\nBut the feedback only said that O is not at position 2, but it could be at position 1,3,4,5? Similarly for others.\n\nBut in candidates like ""plots"", we are placing O at position 3. If the feedback shows ✓ for O, then it\'s correct; otherwise not.\n\nI think it\'s fine.\n\nBut to be systematic, since O was in position 2 and was wrong, and now we try position 3.\n\nSimilarly, S was in position 4 and wrong, now in ""plots"" S is at position 5. T was in position 5 and wrong, now at position 4? Let\'s see:\n\nIn ""moist"":\n   Position 4: S was wrong -> so S not at 4.\n   Position 5: T was wrong -> so T not at 5.\n\nIn ""plots"":\n   S is at position 5 -> not position 4, so okay.\n   T is at position 4 -> not position 5, so okay.\n\nBut position 4 for T: now we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, O at position 3.\n\nAlso, we are testing L at position 2 and P at position 1.\n\nI think ""plots"" is a good word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""fonts"" but N excluded -> invalid.\n\n""pouts"": P,O,U,T,S -> positions: P1,O2,U3,T4,S5 -> but O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.\n\nSo, ""plots"" seems solid.\n\nLet me confirm if ""plots"" is a valid word: yes, meaning small pieces of ground? Or schemes.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""plots"".\n\nGuessed word: plots\n\nSo the response should be: <guess>plots</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E excluded).\n- ""moist"" showed:\n  - M and I absent (so M and I are excluded).\n  - O, S, and T present but in wrong positions (so O not in position 2, S not in position 4, T not in position 5).\n\nThe secret word must contain O, S, T (but not in their guessed positions) and avoid C, R, A, N, E, M, I.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include O, S, T properly placed (O ≠ pos2, S ≠ pos4, T ≠ pos5).\n- Use new letters to test uncovered possibilities.\n- Avoid excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.\n\nOptimal word choice: ""PLOTS""\n- P and L are new letters (not tested before).\n- Positions:\n  - O in position 3 (not 2) → valid.\n  - S in position 5 (not 4) → valid.\n  - T in position 4 (not 5) → valid.\n- Valid 5-letter word (e.g., defined as small areas or schemes).\n- Maximizes information by introducing two new letters (P and L) while satisfying known constraints.\n\n<guess>plots</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(-)\nGuess 3: plots -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) O(✓) T(-) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have three guesses and their feedback:

1. ""crane"": All letters incorrect → Secret word contains no C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""moist"":
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: present but wrong position (-) → O is in the word, not at position 2.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: present but wrong position (-) → S in word, not at position 4.
   - T: present but wrong position (-) → T in word, not at position 5.
3. ""plots"":
   - P: absent (x) → P not in word.
   - L: absent (x) → L not in word.
   - O: correct position (✓) → O is at position 3.
   - T: present but wrong position (-) → T in word but not at position 4.
   - S: present but wrong position (-) → S in word but not at position 5.

Summary of knowns:
- Correct position: O is at position 3 (since it got ✓ in position 3 of ""plots"").
- Present letters (but position unknown): S and T are confirmed present, but their positions are not yet known. From ""plots"", T is not at position 4 and S is not at position 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L.
- From ""plots"": O is at position 3 (fixed), so positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are for other letters.

Secret word structure: _ _ O _ _

Now, we know:
- Letters in the word: O (at position 3), S, T, and two more letters not excluded.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L → So excluded so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we know S and T must be placed.

From feedback:
- In ""moist"", T was not at position 5 → T can be in positions 1,2,4. But in ""plots"", T was at position 4 and got (-), so T is not at position 4 either. Therefore, T cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Possible positions for T: 1 or 2.
- Similarly, S was not at position 4 in ""moist"", and not at position 5 in ""plots"". So S cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Possible positions for S: 1 or 2.

But positions 1 and 2 are only two positions, and we need to place both S and T? But there are two positions (1 and 2) and two letters (S and T), so they must be in positions 1 and 2, in some order.

However, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is O. Positions 4 and 5 are open for two more letters, but we have S and T to place? Wait no: S and T are the remaining confirmed letters, but we also need two more letters because the word has 5 letters and we only have O, S, T. So there must be two additional letters.

We have exactly 3 known present letters: O, S, T. But O is fixed at position 3. S and T must be placed in positions 1,2,4,5 but with constraints:
- S cannot be in position 4 or 5? From feedback:
  - ""moist"": S was at position 4 → (-), so not at 4.
  - ""plots"": S was at position 5 → (-), so not at 5.
  - Therefore S cannot be at positions 4 or 5 → must be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly T:
  - ""moist"": T at position 5 → (-), not at 5.
  - ""plots"": T at position 4 → (-), not at 4.
  - Therefore T cannot be at positions 4 or 5 → must be at position 1 or 2.

But positions 1 and 2 are the only options for both S and T? That would imply that S and T are occupying positions 1 and 2, but then positions 4 and 5 would need to have two more letters? But we only have O, S, T? No, we must have two more letters that are not yet identified.

Yes: the secret word has five distinct letters? Or could have repeats? We don't know, but so far no indication of repeats.

We have confirmed only three letters: O, S, T. But O is at position 3, and S and T must be in the word, but not in positions 4 or 5, so they must be in positions 1 or 2. However, positions 1 and 2 can't both hold two letters? Positions 1 and 2 are two positions, so one of them must have S and the other T? We can place S at 1 and T at 2, or S at 2 and T at 1.

Then positions 4 and 5 must be two new letters that are not S, T, O and not excluded.

Therefore, the word structure must be:
Position 1: either S or T
Position 2: either T or S
Position 3: O
Position 4: unknown letter (not S, T, O, and not excluded)
Position 5: unknown letter (not S, T, O, and not excluded)

Also, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L → available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- First, S and T must be at positions 1 and 2 in some order.
- Then, letters for positions 4 and 5 must be from the available list.

Let's consider possibilities:

Case 1: S at position 1, T at position 2 → word: S T O _ _
Case 2: T at position 1, S at position 2 → word: T S O _ _

Now, we need to fill the last two positions with letters from available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Moreover, the word must exist.

For Case 1: ""STO__"" words?
Common words: 
- ""STOCK"" → but C excluded.
- ""STONE"" → E excluded.
- ""STOVE"" → E excluded? Also V allowed.
- ""STOMP"" → M excluded.
- ""STOVE"" is invalid because E is excluded? First guess E(x).

Other possibilities: 
- ""STOUT"" → T repeated? But we don't know. Also U: not excluded? But positions: S T O U T → That would have T at positions 2 and 5? But in this case position 5 is T. However, we have feedback from ""moist"": T was at 5 and said wrong position → but if T is at 5, why would it be (-)? Only if there is another T? Or if a single T is not at 5? Actually, if T is at position 5, and we guessed T at position 5, it should be (✓). Therefore, since it was (-) in ""moist"", then T cannot be at position 5. So ""stout"" would have T at position 5 → which is forbidden? But if it is a repeated T and one is at 5, it might be marked differently? But the rules don't specify how repeats are handled, but probably for exact position if it matches it should be ✓.

Looking back at feedback:

In ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got (-), meaning that T is in the word but not at position 5. So regardless of repetition, position 5 cannot be T. Therefore, ""stout"" has T at position 5 → invalid if we need T to be absent from position 5.

Similarly, any word with T at position 5 is invalid.

Therefore, ""stout"" doesn't work due to T at position 5.

Similarly: ""STOMA"" → O at 3, but A is excluded? ""A"" was in ""crane"" and absent.

""STORE"" → R and E excluded.

So for ""STO__"": we need the last two letters from available.

Possible words: 
- ""STOBS"" → B is available? But ""STOBS"" is a word? Meaning short sticks? S,T,O,B,S → S at positions 1 and 5? And we need position 5 to be a new letter? But if S is already at position 1, having S at position 5 would be a repeat? But the feedback didn't indicate multiple S. However, it is possible.

But we need to check if S at position 5 is allowed: from previous, S cannot be at position 5? Because in ""plots"" we put S at position 5 and it was (-), meaning S is not at position 5. Therefore, we cannot have S at position 5.

Therefore, ""STOBS"" has S at position 5 → invalid.

Similarly, we cannot have S at position 4 or 5 → only positions 1 or 2. But here position 5 is not allowed.

Therefore, for ""STO__"" the last two positions cannot be S ∴ must be other available letters.

Similarly, T cannot be at position 4 or 5.

So the last two positions must be new letters that are not S or T.

Thus, possibilities:
""STOGY"": S,T,O,G,Y → positions: S1, T2, O3, G4, Y5 → letters: G and Y are available? Yes. And the word ""stogy"" is valid (cigars).

Another: ""STOUK""? U and K → ""stouk"" is Scottish? Maybe not common.

""STOUSH"" etc., but not standard.

""STOFF"" → F? Not great.

But ""stogy"" seems plausible.

Similarly, other words: ""STOUM"" but M excluded.

Case 2: ""TSO__"" → T S O _ _

Words like ""TSOTS""? Not valid.

""TSOOR""? Not familiar.

Common words: ""TSUBO"" → T,S,U,B,O → but O is at position 5? Positions: T1, S2, O3? But position 3 is O, so it would be T1,S2,O3,U4,B5 → and O at position 3 is correct? Yes.

So ""TSOUB""? Not familiar. But ""Tsubo"" might be accepted as unit, but let's stick to common words.

Another: ""TSADI"" → but A excluded? A absent.

""TSARS"" → S again? But we need to avoid S and T in positions 4-5.

""TSARS"" has S at position 4 and 5? But we cannot have S at position 4 → invalid.

""TSKED"" → E excluded.

Therefore, the most plausible for case 1 is ""STOGY"".

But we also have Case 2: T S O _ _, so letters after O: 4 and 5.

For example: ""TSOKE""? Not common.

Perhaps not many words in English start with ""TSO..."". 

We have ""TSOOR""? Scrabbly.

Common is ""tsaddik"" but longer.

Therefore, Case 1 ""STO..."" is more productive.

Other possibilities for STO__: 
- ""STOGY"" as above.
- ""STOPS"" → but S at end? We cannot have S at position 5 → invalid.
- ""STOPT"" → T at end? But T is forbidden at position 5 → invalid.
- ""STOUR"" → R excluded? R from ""crane"" is absent → invalid.
- ""STOUP"" → P excluded? P was guessed in ""plots"" and absent → invalid.
- ""STOOK"" → O and K? ""STOOK"": S,T,O,O,K → two O's? And O at position 3 and also position 4? But position 3 is O (fixed), position 4 cannot be O? Because we don't know.

Feedback never mentioned multiple O's, but it could be. But let's see if it breaks any constraint.

In ""moist"", O was at position 2 and got (-) → meaning O is in the word but not at position 2. If there is another O at position 4, that would be possible.

But in ""stook"": positions: S1, T2, O3, O4, K5 → O at position 4? But we have no constraint on O at position 4? Only that it is not at position 2.

Also, S at position 1: allowed? Yes.
T at position 2: allowed? Yes (only forbidden positions 4 and 5 for T? T cannot be at 4 or 5, but position 2 is allowed).
Then K at position 5: not excluded? K is available.

But in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got (-). Now, if the secret word has T only at position 2, then position 5 in ""moist"" was a wrong position? Yes.

Similarly, for ""stook"": 
- Position 4: O → if there is an O at position 4, when we guessed ""moist"" with O at position 2, why was it (-)? Because there is another O, but the feedback doesn't indicate multiplicity. So multiple O's are possible.

But we must check: in ""moist"", we had one O at position 2 and got (-). That means that O is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn't say anything about other instances.

Similarly, in ""plots"", O at position 3 got (✓), so position 3 is correct for one O. If there are multiple, that's fine.

Now, for ""stook"":
- We have S at position 1 → allowed.
- T at position 2 → allowed (since T cannot be at 4 or 5, but 2 is ok).
- O at position 3 → correct.
- O at position 4: no constraint? But we didn't test O at position 4? Actually, we tested O at position 2 and 3, but not 4. So it could be present? But the feedback didn't indicate it must be only one.
- K at position 5: must be a letter not excluded.

But we must consider: is O supposed to be at position 4? No constraint against it.

But in ""plots"", when we guessed it, we had O only at position 3, and got ✓, so position 3 is correct. But if there's another O, that would be fine.

Similarly, we need to see if the word exists: ""stook"" is valid (sheaves of grain).

But we have another constraint: what is position 4? In ""plots"", we put T at position 4 and got (-), meaning T is not at position 4. But it doesn't say about O at position 4? We didn't put O there.

Therefore, ""stook"" is possible.

Similarly, we have ""stows""? But S at end → position 5: S not allowed.

""stogs"" → S at end → invalid.

Given that, ""stogy"" (also spelled ""stogy"") and ""stook"" are candidates.

""stogy"": S T O G Y → all positions seem okay? G at position 4? No constraint.

Also, they use new letters: G and Y.

Similarly, ""stook"": O and K? But O is already present? So new letter K.

Now, another word: ""stogy"" is slightly more common? But both are acceptable.

To distinguish: we don't know the position of S and T exactly in ""stook"": S at 1, T at 2, which is same as ""stogy"".

But for position 4 and 5: in ""stogy"" they are G and Y; in ""stook"" they are O and K.

But we have limited guesses left, so we need to choose one.

Another possibility: ""stood"" → D? But O at position 4? But then S T O O D → similar to ""stook"". And ""stood"" has E? No, it doesn't. ""stood"" exists. But positions: S1,T2,O3,O4,D5 → so position 5 is D.

Now, D not excluded.

Therefore, possibilities for ""STO__"":

- ""STOGY"": positions:4=G, 5=Y
- ""STOOD"": positions:4=O, 5=D → O at position 4? That's a second O. And we have T at position 2, which is allowed.

But we also need to consider the other case: T S O _ _

For example: ""TSOES"" → E excluded, S at end and at start? Not good.

""TSOOR"" → O at position 4 again? Position 4: O? And position 5: R? But R excluded.

Not many words? So likely Case 1 is more promising.

Now, back to Case 1: ""STO__"" with 4th and 5th position: must choose from available letters and form valid word.

Other words: ""stoep"" → E excluded.

""stogy"", ""stook"", ""stood"", ""stowp"" → P excluded.

Therefore, good candidates: ""stogy"", ""stook"", ""stood"".

We need to test one.

Considering the feedback: we don't know if there is a second O or not.

Moreover, we have not used some vowels? But U is available.

""stour"" excluded? R not allowed.

Therefore, I'll go with ""stook"" because it uses K, which is a new letter, and we can see.

But ""stogy"" is also fine.

To maximize new letters, ""stogy"" introduces G and Y; ""stook"" introduces K and a second O? But O is already known, so new letter K.

Similarly, ""stood"" introduces D and a second O.

Perhaps ""stogy"" since Y is common?

But let's decide: since O is already known and position fixed, introducing entirely new letters like G and Y might be better than reusing O.

Also, ""stogy"" means cigars, acceptable.

So I'll choose ""stogy"".

But wait: ""stogy"" or ""stogy""? Correct spelling.

So guessed word: stogy

Therefore, <guess>stogy</guess>
</think>
**Thought Process:**

We have three guesses and feedback so far:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  All letters absent → Secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.

- **Guess 2: ""moist"" → FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(-)**  
  M and I absent → Exclude M and I.  
  O, S, T present but in wrong positions: O not pos 2, S not pos 4, T not pos 5.

- **Guess 3: ""plots"" → FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) O(✓) T(-) S(-)**  
  P and L absent → Exclude P and L.  
  O correct at position 3!  
  T and S present but wrong positions: T not pos 4, S not pos 5.

**Key deductions:**
- **Confirmed letters:**  
  - O is fixed at position 3 (from ""plots"" ✓).  
  - S and T are in the word (from ""moist"" and ""plots"" -), but positions unknown.
- **Known constraints for S and T:**  
  - S cannot be at pos 4 (from ""moist"") or pos 5 (from ""plots"") → S must be at pos 1 or 2.  
  - T cannot be at pos 4 (from ""plots"") or pos 5 (from ""moist"") → T must be at pos 1 or 2.  
- **Excluded letters:** C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L → 9 letters excluded.  
- **Available letters:** B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (14 letters).  
- **Secret word structure:**  
  Positions 1 and 2 must be filled by S and T (in some order), position 3 is O, positions 4 and 5 require two new letters from the available list.

**Possible secret words:**  
- **Case 1: S at position 1, T at position 2 → Structure: S T O _ _**  
  Words like ""STOGY"" (S,T,O,G,Y), ""STOOD"" (S,T,O,O,D), or ""STOOK"" (S,T,O,O,K). ""STOMP"" or ""STONE"" invalid due to excluded letters.  
- **Case 2: T at position 1, S at position 2 → Structure: T S O _ _**  
  Few valid options (e.g., ""TSOBO"" not common), so Case 1 is more promising.

**Selected guess: ""STOGY""**  
- **Why?**  
  - Tests the common S-first/T-second order.  
  - Uses two new available letters (G and Y) to maximize information.  
  - Avoids repeated letters and excluded characters.  
  - Valid English word (""stogy"" meaning a type of cigar).  
- **Positions:**  
  - S at pos 1 (allowed since S ≠ pos 4 or 5).  
  - T at pos 2 (allowed since T ≠ pos 4 or 5).  
  - O at pos 3 (confirmed correct).  
  - G at pos 4 and Y at pos 5 (both untested letters).  

If feedback shows ✓ for S or T positions, we lock in their locations. Otherwise, we confirm the alternative order (T S O _ _) for future guesses.

<guess>stogy</guess>",stogy,"We have three guesses and their feedback:

1. ""crane"": All letters incorrect → Secret word contains no C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""moist"":
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: present but wrong position (-) → O is in the word, not at position 2.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: present but wrong position (-) → S in word, not at position 4.
   - T: present but wrong position (-) → T in word, not at position 5.
3. ""plots"":
   - P: absent (x) → P not in word.
   - L: absent (x) → L not in word.
   - O: correct position (✓) → O is at position 3.
   - T: present but wrong position (-) → T in word but not at position 4.
   - S: present but wrong position (-) → S in word but not at position 5.

Summary of knowns:
- Correct position: O is at position 3 (since it got ✓ in position 3 of ""plots"").
- Present letters (but position unknown): S and T are confirmed present, but their positions are not yet known. From ""plots"", T is not at position 4 and S is not at position 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L.
- From ""plots"": O is at position 3 (fixed), so positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are for other letters.

Secret word structure: _ _ O _ _

Now, we know:
- Letters in the word: O (at position 3), S, T, and two more letters not excluded.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L → So excluded so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we know S and T must be placed.

From feedback:
- In ""moist"", T was not at position 5 → T can be in positions 1,2,4. But in ""plots"", T was at position 4 and got (-), so T is not at position 4 either. Therefore, T cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Possible positions for T: 1 or 2.
- Similarly, S was not at position 4 in ""moist"", and not at position 5 in ""plots"". So S cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Possible positions for S: 1 or 2.

But positions 1 and 2 are only two positions, and we need to place both S and T? But there are two positions (1 and 2) and two letters (S and T), so they must be in positions 1 and 2, in some order.

However, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is O. Positions 4 and 5 are open for two more letters, but we have S and T to place? Wait no: S and T are the remaining confirmed letters, but we also need two more letters because the word has 5 letters and we only have O, S, T. So there must be two additional letters.

We have exactly 3 known present letters: O, S, T. But O is fixed at position 3. S and T must be placed in positions 1,2,4,5 but with constraints:
- S cannot be in position 4 or 5? From feedback:
  - ""moist"": S was at position 4 → (-), so not at 4.
  - ""plots"": S was at position 5 → (-), so not at 5.
  - Therefore S cannot be at positions 4 or 5 → must be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly T:
  - ""moist"": T at position 5 → (-), not at 5.
  - ""plots"": T at position 4 → (-), not at 4.
  - Therefore T cannot be at positions 4 or 5 → must be at position 1 or 2.

But positions 1 and 2 are the only options for both S and T? That would imply that S and T are occupying positions 1 and 2, but then positions 4 and 5 would need to have two more letters? But we only have O, S, T? No, we must have two more letters that are not yet identified.

Yes: the secret word has five distinct letters? Or could have repeats? We don't know, but so far no indication of repeats.

We have confirmed only three letters: O, S, T. But O is at position 3, and S and T must be in the word, but not in positions 4 or 5, so they must be in positions 1 or 2. However, positions 1 and 2 can't both hold two letters? Positions 1 and 2 are two positions, so one of them must have S and the other T? We can place S at 1 and T at 2, or S at 2 and T at 1.

Then positions 4 and 5 must be two new letters that are not S, T, O and not excluded.

Therefore, the word structure must be:
Position 1: either S or T
Position 2: either T or S
Position 3: O
Position 4: unknown letter (not S, T, O, and not excluded)
Position 5: unknown letter (not S, T, O, and not excluded)

Also, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L → available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- First, S and T must be at positions 1 and 2 in some order.
- Then, letters for positions 4 and 5 must be from the available list.

Let's consider possibilities:

Case 1: S at position 1, T at position 2 → word: S T O _ _
Case 2: T at position 1, S at position 2 → word: T S O _ _

Now, we need to fill the last two positions with letters from available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Moreover, the word must exist.

For Case 1: ""STO__"" words?
Common words: 
- ""STOCK"" → but C excluded.
- ""STONE"" → E excluded.
- ""STOVE"" → E excluded? Also V allowed.
- ""STOMP"" → M excluded.
- ""STOVE"" is invalid because E is excluded? First guess E(x).

Other possibilities: 
- ""STOUT"" → T repeated? But we don't know. Also U: not excluded? But positions: S T O U T → That would have T at positions 2 and 5? But in this case position 5 is T. However, we have feedback from ""moist"": T was at 5 and said wrong position → but if T is at 5, why would it be (-)? Only if there is another T? Or if a single T is not at 5? Actually, if T is at position 5, and we guessed T at position 5, it should be (✓). Therefore, since it was (-) in ""moist"", then T cannot be at position 5. So ""stout"" would have T at position 5 → which is forbidden? But if it is a repeated T and one is at 5, it might be marked differently? But the rules don't specify how repeats are handled, but probably for exact position if it matches it should be ✓.

Looking back at feedback:

In ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got (-), meaning that T is in the word but not at position 5. So regardless of repetition, position 5 cannot be T. Therefore, ""stout"" has T at position 5 → invalid if we need T to be absent from position 5.

Similarly, any word with T at position 5 is invalid.

Therefore, ""stout"" doesn't work due to T at position 5.

Similarly: ""STOMA"" → O at 3, but A is excluded? ""A"" was in ""crane"" and absent.

""STORE"" → R and E excluded.

So for ""STO__"": we need the last two letters from available.

Possible words: 
- ""STOBS"" → B is available? But ""STOBS"" is a word? Meaning short sticks? S,T,O,B,S → S at positions 1 and 5? And we need position 5 to be a new letter? But if S is already at position 1, having S at position 5 would be a repeat? But the feedback didn't indicate multiple S. However, it is possible.

But we need to check if S at position 5 is allowed: from previous, S cannot be at position 5? Because in ""plots"" we put S at position 5 and it was (-), meaning S is not at position 5. Therefore, we cannot have S at position 5.

Therefore, ""STOBS"" has S at position 5 → invalid.

Similarly, we cannot have S at position 4 or 5 → only positions 1 or 2. But here position 5 is not allowed.

Therefore, for ""STO__"" the last two positions cannot be S ∴ must be other available letters.

Similarly, T cannot be at position 4 or 5.

So the last two positions must be new letters that are not S or T.

Thus, possibilities:
""STOGY"": S,T,O,G,Y → positions: S1, T2, O3, G4, Y5 → letters: G and Y are available? Yes. And the word ""stogy"" is valid (cigars).

Another: ""STOUK""? U and K → ""stouk"" is Scottish? Maybe not common.

""STOUSH"" etc., but not standard.

""STOFF"" → F? Not great.

But ""stogy"" seems plausible.

Similarly, other words: ""STOUM"" but M excluded.

Case 2: ""TSO__"" → T S O _ _

Words like ""TSOTS""? Not valid.

""TSOOR""? Not familiar.

Common words: ""TSUBO"" → T,S,U,B,O → but O is at position 5? Positions: T1, S2, O3? But position 3 is O, so it would be T1,S2,O3,U4,B5 → and O at position 3 is correct? Yes.

So ""TSOUB""? Not familiar. But ""Tsubo"" might be accepted as unit, but let's stick to common words.

Another: ""TSADI"" → but A excluded? A absent.

""TSARS"" → S again? But we need to avoid S and T in positions 4-5.

""TSARS"" has S at position 4 and 5? But we cannot have S at position 4 → invalid.

""TSKED"" → E excluded.

Therefore, the most plausible for case 1 is ""STOGY"".

But we also have Case 2: T S O _ _, so letters after O: 4 and 5.

For example: ""TSOKE""? Not common.

Perhaps not many words in English start with ""TSO..."". 

We have ""TSOOR""? Scrabbly.

Common is ""tsaddik"" but longer.

Therefore, Case 1 ""STO..."" is more productive.

Other possibilities for STO__: 
- ""STOGY"" as above.
- ""STOPS"" → but S at end? We cannot have S at position 5 → invalid.
- ""STOPT"" → T at end? But T is forbidden at position 5 → invalid.
- ""STOUR"" → R excluded? R from ""crane"" is absent → invalid.
- ""STOUP"" → P excluded? P was guessed in ""plots"" and absent → invalid.
- ""STOOK"" → O and K? ""STOOK"": S,T,O,O,K → two O's? And O at position 3 and also position 4? But position 3 is O (fixed), position 4 cannot be O? Because we don't know.

Feedback never mentioned multiple O's, but it could be. But let's see if it breaks any constraint.

In ""moist"", O was at position 2 and got (-) → meaning O is in the word but not at position 2. If there is another O at position 4, that would be possible.

But in ""stook"": positions: S1, T2, O3, O4, K5 → O at position 4? But we have no constraint on O at position 4? Only that it is not at position 2.

Also, S at position 1: allowed? Yes.
T at position 2: allowed? Yes (only forbidden positions 4 and 5 for T? T cannot be at 4 or 5, but position 2 is allowed).
Then K at position 5: not excluded? K is available.

But in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got (-). Now, if the secret word has T only at position 2, then position 5 in ""moist"" was a wrong position? Yes.

Similarly, for ""stook"": 
- Position 4: O → if there is an O at position 4, when we guessed ""moist"" with O at position 2, why was it (-)? Because there is another O, but the feedback doesn't indicate multiplicity. So multiple O's are possible.

But we must check: in ""moist"", we had one O at position 2 and got (-). That means that O is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn't say anything about other instances.

Similarly, in ""plots"", O at position 3 got (✓), so position 3 is correct for one O. If there are multiple, that's fine.

Now, for ""stook"":
- We have S at position 1 → allowed.
- T at position 2 → allowed (since T cannot be at 4 or 5, but 2 is ok).
- O at position 3 → correct.
- O at position 4: no constraint? But we didn't test O at position 4? Actually, we tested O at position 2 and 3, but not 4. So it could be present? But the feedback didn't indicate it must be only one.
- K at position 5: must be a letter not excluded.

But we must consider: is O supposed to be at position 4? No constraint against it.

But in ""plots"", when we guessed it, we had O only at position 3, and got ✓, so position 3 is correct. But if there's another O, that would be fine.

Similarly, we need to see if the word exists: ""stook"" is valid (sheaves of grain).

But we have another constraint: what is position 4? In ""plots"", we put T at position 4 and got (-), meaning T is not at position 4. But it doesn't say about O at position 4? We didn't put O there.

Therefore, ""stook"" is possible.

Similarly, we have ""stows""? But S at end → position 5: S not allowed.

""stogs"" → S at end → invalid.

Given that, ""stogy"" (also spelled ""stogy"") and ""stook"" are candidates.

""stogy"": S T O G Y → all positions seem okay? G at position 4? No constraint.

Also, they use new letters: G and Y.

Similarly, ""stook"": O and K? But O is already present? So new letter K.

Now, another word: ""stogy"" is slightly more common? But both are acceptable.

To distinguish: we don't know the position of S and T exactly in ""stook"": S at 1, T at 2, which is same as ""stogy"".

But for position 4 and 5: in ""stogy"" they are G and Y; in ""stook"" they are O and K.

But we have limited guesses left, so we need to choose one.

Another possibility: ""stood"" → D? But O at position 4? But then S T O O D → similar to ""stook"". And ""stood"" has E? No, it doesn't. ""stood"" exists. But positions: S1,T2,O3,O4,D5 → so position 5 is D.

Now, D not excluded.

Therefore, possibilities for ""STO__"":

- ""STOGY"": positions:4=G, 5=Y
- ""STOOD"": positions:4=O, 5=D → O at position 4? That's a second O. And we have T at position 2, which is allowed.

But we also need to consider the other case: T S O _ _

For example: ""TSOES"" → E excluded, S at end and at start? Not good.

""TSOOR"" → O at position 4 again? Position 4: O? And position 5: R? But R excluded.

Not many words? So likely Case 1 is more promising.

Now, back to Case 1: ""STO__"" with 4th and 5th position: must choose from available letters and form valid word.

Other words: ""stoep"" → E excluded.

""stogy"", ""stook"", ""stood"", ""stowp"" → P excluded.

Therefore, good candidates: ""stogy"", ""stook"", ""stood"".

We need to test one.

Considering the feedback: we don't know if there is a second O or not.

Moreover, we have not used some vowels? But U is available.

""stour"" excluded? R not allowed.

Therefore, I'll go with ""stook"" because it uses K, which is a new letter, and we can see.

But ""stogy"" is also fine.

To maximize new letters, ""stogy"" introduces G and Y; ""stook"" introduces K and a second O? But O is already known, so new letter K.

Similarly, ""stood"" introduces D and a second O.

Perhaps ""stogy"" since Y is common?

But let's decide: since O is already known and position fixed, introducing entirely new letters like G and Y might be better than reusing O.

Also, ""stogy"" means cigars, acceptable.

So I'll choose ""stogy"".

But wait: ""stogy"" or ""stogy""? Correct spelling.

So guessed word: stogy

We have three guesses and feedback so far:

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,STOOD,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common letters: I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback that for the first guess ""crane"", all letters are incorrect (x). 
 This means that the secret word contains none of the letters: C, R, A, N, E.

 Therefore, we must choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain any of these letters.

 We need to avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's think of common 5-letter words without these letters.

 Some common starting letters might be: S, T, B, L, P, etc.

 We can try words like ""sight"", ""plumb"", ""dough"", etc. But let's check:

 We must avoid: C, R, A, N, E.

 Let's try to form a word with other common letters.

 Consider: S, T, L, I, O, U, M, P, B, D, G, H, etc.

 A good candidate might be ""SLOTH"" but let's check the letters: S, L, O, T, H -> none of the forbidden letters.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" has P, I, O, U, S -> also safe.

 But note: we want to maximize information. We should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

 Since we have eliminated 5 letters, we have 21 left. We should try to use 5 new letters that are common.

 Let's list the frequency of letters in English words (without C, R, A, N, E). The most common remaining letters are: T, O, I, S, L, etc.

 We can try ""TOILS"" or ""STOMP"" or ""PILOT"".

 However, note that we are in the second guess and we have no correct letters so far. We want to test as many new letters as possible.

 Let me choose ""SPLIT"": 
   S, P, L, I, T -> none of the forbidden letters (C,R,A,N,E). 

 But wait, is ""SPLIT"" a valid word? Yes.

 Alternatively, ""MOIST"" is also a good candidate: M, O, I, S, T.

 Another one: ""GHOUL"" but that has G, H, O, U, L -> but we might want to avoid less common letters.

 Since we are early in the game, we should focus on common letters.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a good choice because it has common letters and we haven't tried M, O, I, S, T.

 But note: we are avoiding C,R,A,N,E, and MOIST doesn't have any of those.

 So, I'll go with ""MOIST"".

 However, let me double-check: 
   M: not in {C,R,A,N,E}
   O: not in
   I: not in
   S: not in
   T: not in

 Yes.

 Alternatively, we could use ""PIOUS"" but that has U which is less common. Or ""BUMPY"" but that has B,U,M,P,Y and Y is also less common.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice.

 Therefore, my second guess is ""MOIST"".After the first guess ""crane"" resulted in all letters being incorrect (C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word), I need to choose a new word that avoids these letters entirely. The new guess should maximize coverage of common unused letters to gather more information. 

I considered words like ""sight,"" ""plumb,"" and ""dough,"" but settled on ""moist"" because:
- It uses common letters (M, O, I, S, T) not yet tested.
- None of its letters (M, O, I, S, T) overlap with the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E).
- It covers vowels (O, I) and frequent consonants (M, S, T), increasing the chance of hits.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

1. ""crane"": All letters are incorrect (x). So the secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.

2. ""moist"": 
   - M: x (not in the word at all)
   - O: - (in the word but wrong position)
   - I: x (not in the word)
   - S: - (in the word but wrong position)
   - T: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from ""moist"":
- O, S, T are in the word but in the wrong positions.
- M and I are not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word contains O, S, T, and does not contain M, I, and also not C,R,A,N,E from the first guess.

Also, since O, S, T are present but not in the positions they were in ""moist"":
- Position 2: O is incorrect -> so O is not in position 2.
- Position 4: S is incorrect -> so S is not in position 4.
- Position 5: T is incorrect -> so T is not in position 5.

Moreover, from the first guess, we know that C, R, A, N, E, M, I are all absent.

Now, we need to guess a word that:
- Contains O, S, T (since we know they are in the word).
- Does not contain any of: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.
- And we must place O, S, T in positions that are not their original positions from ""moist"":
  - O cannot be in position 2.
  - S cannot be in position 4.
  - T cannot be in position 5.

Additionally, we need to include two more letters (since it's a 5-letter word) that are not in the excluded list.

We also know the positions from ""moist"":
- Position 1: M (wrong) -> we must avoid M and since it's absent, we cannot use M.
- Position 2: O (wrong position) -> we know O is present, but we must not put O at position 2 again, and we know it must be somewhere else.
- Position 3: I (absent) -> avoid I.
- Position 4: S (wrong position) -> so S is not at 4.
- Position 5: T (wrong position) -> so T is not at 5.

Now, let's list the known present letters: O, S, T.

We need to choose a word that has O, S, T, and two more letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I. So 7 letters excluded.

Available letters: all others: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to form a 5-letter word that includes O, S, T and two others from the available set.

Moreover, we should avoid placing O at position 2, S at position 4, T at position 5.

Also, note that the word must be a valid English word.

Let me try to think of words that contain O, S, T.

Some ideas:
- ""ghost"" -> but G,H,O,S,T. But O is at position 3, S at 4, T at 5? 
  - However, in ""moist"", we have S at position 4 and T at position 5 and they were marked wrong position. So in ""ghost"":
    - Position 4: S (but we cannot have S at position 4 because feedback said S is in the word but not at position 4).
    - Similarly, T is at position 5 which is not allowed.
  - So ""ghost"" is invalid because S and T are in the forbidden positions.

Alternatively, ""boost"" -> B,O,O,S,T. But two O's? Let's check:
  - Positions: B(1), O(2), O(3), S(4), T(5)
  - But O is at position 2 -> we cannot have O at position 2 (from ""moist"" feedback). Also S at 4 and T at 5 are forbidden. So not good.

""posts"" -> P,O,S,T,S -> but 5 letters? ""POSTS"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning stakes.
- Positions: P(1), O(2), S(3), T(4), S(5)
- Now, O is at position 2 -> forbidden for O. S is at position 3 and also at 5, but the feedback only says S is present and not at position 4. It doesn't say anything about other positions. However, we must avoid O at position 2. So post is O at 2 -> invalid.

We need a word where O is not in position 2, S not in position 4, T not in position 5.

Let me try to list positions:

We have O, S, T to place, each must be in a new position.

Possible positions for O: 1,3,4,5 (but not 2)
For S: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)
For T: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)

But they must be in a single word, so we need to assign positions to O, S, T and also two more letters.

Also, since S and T are present, and O, we have 3 known letters.

Now, we don't know if there is another O or something? But so far only one O indicated? But feedback doesn't say multiple. We have to be cautious.

In feedback, when a letter is repeated, it might be handled differently, but in this case we haven't encountered repetition.

Let me try to think of words:

- ""stomp"" -> but M is excluded. We cannot use M.

- ""stow"" is only 4 letters. We need 5.

- ""spots"": S, P, O, T, S -> but two S's? Let me see:
  Positions: S(1), P(2), O(3), T(4), S(5)
  Check against constraints:
    O at position 3: allowed (not position 2)
    S at position 1 and 5: allowed (only forbidden for S is position 4)
    T at position 4: allowed (forbidden only position 5 for T)

So ""spots"" might be a candidate. But note we have two S's. The feedback from ""moist"" had S present, but it didn't specify the count. It could be one or more.

However, we must avoid excluded letters: S, P, O, T, S -> letters: S, P, O, T. None of these are in the excluded set (C,R,A,N,E,M,I). So it's okay.

But let's check: the word ""spots"" has two S's. We don't know if the secret word has two S's or not. But it could be possible.

Alternatively, ""stout"": S, T, O, U, T -> two T's? Letters: S, T, O, U, T -> U is allowed? U is not excluded. Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), U(4), T(5)
Now constraints:
  O at 3: allowed (not 2)
  S at 1: allowed (not restricted except not position 4? and 1 is okay)
  T at 2 and 5: but T at 5 is forbidden? We cannot have T at position 5? Yes, so T at position 5 is not allowed. So ""stout"" has T at position 5 -> invalid.

""joust"": J, O, U, S, T -> positions: J(1), O(2) -> O cannot be at position 2 -> invalid.

""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> O at position 2 -> invalid.

""focus"": F, O, C, U, S -> but C is excluded! Cannot use C.

""fluid"": F, L, U, I, D -> but I is excluded.

""fonts"": F, O, N, T, S -> but N is excluded from first feedback -> N(x) so N not in word.

""knots"": K, N, O, T, S -> N excluded.

We need to avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I. So avoid any word with these.

Back to ""spots"": it seemed okay? Letters: S, P, O, T, S -> no excluded letters.

Positions: 
- S at 1: okay
- P at 2: not known, but allowed
- O at 3: okay (not position 2)
- T at 4: okay (forbidden is only position 5 for T)
- S at 5: okay

So ""spots"" meets the constraints.

Another candidate: ""posts"" is P,O,S,T,S -> same as ""spots"" but rearranged.

""posts"": P(1), O(2), S(3), T(4), S(5)
But O is at position 2 -> forbidden. So not allowed.

So ""posts"" has O at position 2 -> invalid.

But ""spots"" has S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 4, S at 5 -> no O at 2.

What about ""boots""? B,O,O,T,S? That has two O's? Positions: B(1),O(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)
O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.

""costs""? But C and S? C excluded.

""tousy""? Not a common word.

""stops"": S, T, O, P, S -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),P(4),S(5)
Check:
  O at 3: ok
  S at 1 and 5: ok (not position 4)
  T at 2: ok (only forbidden position for T is position 5)
Also, P at 4: we don't have any constraint against P at 4? So okay.

So ""stops"" seems valid? But it has S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3, P at 4, S at 5.

We need to compare with feedback: we know S is not at position 4, and T not at position 5, which is satisfied here.

Similarly, ""spots"" also: S(1),P(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)

Now, both ""spots"" and ""stops"" are candidates.

But note: we also have O, which is known to be present, and in ""stops"" O is at position 3, and in ""spots"" also at position 3.

Both have S at the beginning and end.

Other candidate: ""plots""? P,L,O,T,S -> positions: P(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)
Again, O at 3, T at 4, S at 5 -> S at position 5 is allowed? Only forbidden for S is position 4, so position 5 is okay.

But S is at position 5, not 4.

Similarly, all constraints satisfied.

Another candidate: ""shots"": S,H,O,T,S -> positions: S(1),H(2),O(3),T(4),S(5) -> same pattern.

All these seem okay? But we need to choose one.

We also can consider ""south"" or something? ""south"": S,O,U,T,H -> positions: S(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5)
But O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.

""fists""? No O.

We must include O, S, T.

So ""sloth"": S,L,O,T,H -> positions: S(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),H(5)
Again, L at position 2? That's allowed? O at 3, T at 4, H at 5: no constraint violated.

But ""sloth"" avoids excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I -> L,H,O,S,T are not excluded.

Yes.

Now, among these candidates: ""spots"", ""stops"", ""plots"", ""shots"", ""sloth"", etc.

Which one to choose? Since we have O, S, T as known, and we are trying to locate their positions, and test new letters.

We might want to test letters that have not been used yet to gain more information.

From first guess: we used C,R,A,N,E -> all absent.
Second guess: M,O,I,S,T -> O,S,T present, M,I absent.

So far, the letters we have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T.

Therefore, new letters would be: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

In ""spots"": it uses S,O,T (known present) and P (new) and again S.

Similarly, ""stops"": same letters: S,O,T,P and S.

""plots"": P,L,O,T,S -> S,O,T known, and P,L new.

""shots"": S,H,O,T,S -> S,O,T known, and H new.

""sloth"": S,L,O,T,H -> S,O,T known, and L,H new.

To maximize information, we should choose a word with as many new letters as possible, but since S,O,T are already present, we can test different positions and new letters.

Ideally, we cover new consonants in positions that might be correct.

Given that, ""plots"" uses two new letters: P and L.

""shots"" uses one new letter: H.

""sloth"" uses two: L and H.

""spots"" uses one new letter: P.

So words like ""plots"" or ""sloth"" are better because they test two new letters.

But in ""plots"": 
- Position 1: P (new)
- Position 2: L (new)
- Position 3: O (we know O is present, but we are testing if position 3 is correct for O? Not exactly, but if we get a ✓ for O at position 3, that's good; but if not, we know it's not at position 3 either)

Similarly with ""sloth"".

Another candidate: ""gloats""? But that would be 6 letters? ""gloat"" is 5? ""GLOAT"" is 5: G,L,O,A,T -> A is excluded! Cannot.

""blots"": B,L,O,T,S -> letters: B,L,O,T,S -> none excluded? Positions: B(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)

So ""blots"" is also a candidate: B and L new.

Now, let me list the candidates:
- spots: uses P (new), and S,O,T at positions: S1, O3, T4
- stops: S1,T2,O3,P4,S5 -> T at position 2? And P at 4? Let me not use stops because T is at position 2 which is new to test.
- but stops: letters S,T,O,P,S -> same as spots but different arrangement? Actually stops: S,T,O,P,S -> positions: S at1, T at2, O at3, P at4, S at5 -> so placing T at 2 and P at4.

Similarly, plots: positions P1,L2,O3,T4,S5 -> O and T fixed at 3 and 4? But we don't know if they are correct.

Actually, all these have O at position 3 and T at position 4? In plots, O at3, T at4? Yes.

But the feedback only said that O is not at position 2, but it could be at position 1,3,4,5? Similarly for others.

But in candidates like ""plots"", we are placing O at position 3. If the feedback shows ✓ for O, then it's correct; otherwise not.

I think it's fine.

But to be systematic, since O was in position 2 and was wrong, and now we try position 3.

Similarly, S was in position 4 and wrong, now in ""plots"" S is at position 5. T was in position 5 and wrong, now at position 4? Let's see:

In ""moist"":
   Position 4: S was wrong -> so S not at 4.
   Position 5: T was wrong -> so T not at 5.

In ""plots"":
   S is at position 5 -> not position 4, so okay.
   T is at position 4 -> not position 5, so okay.

But position 4 for T: now we don't know.

Similarly, O at position 3.

Also, we are testing L at position 2 and P at position 1.

I think ""plots"" is a good word.

Another candidate: ""fonts"" but N excluded -> invalid.

""pouts"": P,O,U,T,S -> positions: P1,O2,U3,T4,S5 -> but O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.

So, ""plots"" seems solid.

Let me confirm if ""plots"" is a valid word: yes, meaning small pieces of ground? Or schemes.

Therefore, I'll go with ""plots"".

Guessed word: plots

So the response should be: <guess>plots</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E excluded).
- ""moist"" showed:
  - M and I absent (so M and I are excluded).
  - O, S, and T present but in wrong positions (so O not in position 2, S not in position 4, T not in position 5).

The secret word must contain O, S, T (but not in their guessed positions) and avoid C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

For the next guess:
- Must include O, S, T properly placed (O ≠ pos2, S ≠ pos4, T ≠ pos5).
- Use new letters to test uncovered possibilities.
- Avoid excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.

Optimal word choice: ""PLOTS""
- P and L are new letters (not tested before).
- Positions:
  - O in position 3 (not 2) → valid.
  - S in position 5 (not 4) → valid.
  - T in position 4 (not 5) → valid.
- Valid 5-letter word (e.g., defined as small areas or schemes).
- Maximizes information by introducing two new letters (P and L) while satisfying known constraints.

<guess>plots</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(-)
Guess 3: plots -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) O(✓) T(-) S(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have three guesses and their feedback:

1. ""crane"": All letters incorrect → Secret word contains no C, R, A, N, E.
2. ""moist"":
   - M: absent (x)
   - O: present but wrong position (-) → O is in the word, not at position 2.
   - I: absent (x)
   - S: present but wrong position (-) → S in word, not at position 4.
   - T: present but wrong position (-) → T in word, not at position 5.
3. ""plots"":
   - P: absent (x) → P not in word.
   - L: absent (x) → L not in word.
   - O: correct position (✓) → O is at position 3.
   - T: present but wrong position (-) → T in word but not at position 4.
   - S: present but wrong position (-) → S in word but not at position 5.

Summary of knowns:
- Correct position: O is at position 3 (since it got ✓ in position 3 of ""plots"").
- Present letters (but position unknown): S and T are confirmed present, but their positions are not yet known. From ""plots"", T is not at position 4 and S is not at position 5.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L.
- From ""plots"": O is at position 3 (fixed), so positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are for other letters.

Secret word structure: _ _ O _ _

Now, we know:
- Letters in the word: O (at position 3), S, T, and two more letters not excluded.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L → So excluded so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we know S and T must be placed.

From feedback:
- In ""moist"", T was not at position 5 → T can be in positions 1,2,4. But in ""plots"", T was at position 4 and got (-), so T is not at position 4 either. Therefore, T cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Possible positions for T: 1 or 2.
- Similarly, S was not at position 4 in ""moist"", and not at position 5 in ""plots"". So S cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Possible positions for S: 1 or 2.

But positions 1 and 2 are only two positions, and we need to place both S and T? But there are two positions (1 and 2) and two letters (S and T), so they must be in positions 1 and 2, in some order.

However, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is O. Positions 4 and 5 are open for two more letters, but we have S and T to place? Wait no: S and T are the remaining confirmed letters, but we also need two more letters because the word has 5 letters and we only have O, S, T. So there must be two additional letters.

We have exactly 3 known present letters: O, S, T. But O is fixed at position 3. S and T must be placed in positions 1,2,4,5 but with constraints:
- S cannot be in position 4 or 5? From feedback:
  - ""moist"": S was at position 4 → (-), so not at 4.
  - ""plots"": S was at position 5 → (-), so not at 5.
  - Therefore S cannot be at positions 4 or 5 → must be at position 1 or 2.

Similarly T:
  - ""moist"": T at position 5 → (-), not at 5.
  - ""plots"": T at position 4 → (-), not at 4.
  - Therefore T cannot be at positions 4 or 5 → must be at position 1 or 2.

But positions 1 and 2 are the only options for both S and T? That would imply that S and T are occupying positions 1 and 2, but then positions 4 and 5 would need to have two more letters? But we only have O, S, T? No, we must have two more letters that are not yet identified.

Yes: the secret word has five distinct letters? Or could have repeats? We don't know, but so far no indication of repeats.

We have confirmed only three letters: O, S, T. But O is at position 3, and S and T must be in the word, but not in positions 4 or 5, so they must be in positions 1 or 2. However, positions 1 and 2 can't both hold two letters? Positions 1 and 2 are two positions, so one of them must have S and the other T? We can place S at 1 and T at 2, or S at 2 and T at 1.

Then positions 4 and 5 must be two new letters that are not S, T, O and not excluded.

Therefore, the word structure must be:
Position 1: either S or T
Position 2: either T or S
Position 3: O
Position 4: unknown letter (not S, T, O, and not excluded)
Position 5: unknown letter (not S, T, O, and not excluded)

Also, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L → available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits:
- First, S and T must be at positions 1 and 2 in some order.
- Then, letters for positions 4 and 5 must be from the available list.

Let's consider possibilities:

Case 1: S at position 1, T at position 2 → word: S T O _ _
Case 2: T at position 1, S at position 2 → word: T S O _ _

Now, we need to fill the last two positions with letters from available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Moreover, the word must exist.

For Case 1: ""STO__"" words?
Common words: 
- ""STOCK"" → but C excluded.
- ""STONE"" → E excluded.
- ""STOVE"" → E excluded? Also V allowed.
- ""STOMP"" → M excluded.
- ""STOVE"" is invalid because E is excluded? First guess E(x).

Other possibilities: 
- ""STOUT"" → T repeated? But we don't know. Also U: not excluded? But positions: S T O U T → That would have T at positions 2 and 5? But in this case position 5 is T. However, we have feedback from ""moist"": T was at 5 and said wrong position → but if T is at 5, why would it be (-)? Only if there is another T? Or if a single T is not at 5? Actually, if T is at position 5, and we guessed T at position 5, it should be (✓). Therefore, since it was (-) in ""moist"", then T cannot be at position 5. So ""stout"" would have T at position 5 → which is forbidden? But if it is a repeated T and one is at 5, it might be marked differently? But the rules don't specify how repeats are handled, but probably for exact position if it matches it should be ✓.

Looking back at feedback:

In ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got (-), meaning that T is in the word but not at position 5. So regardless of repetition, position 5 cannot be T. Therefore, ""stout"" has T at position 5 → invalid if we need T to be absent from position 5.

Similarly, any word with T at position 5 is invalid.

Therefore, ""stout"" doesn't work due to T at position 5.

Similarly: ""STOMA"" → O at 3, but A is excluded? ""A"" was in ""crane"" and absent.

""STORE"" → R and E excluded.

So for ""STO__"": we need the last two letters from available.

Possible words: 
- ""STOBS"" → B is available? But ""STOBS"" is a word? Meaning short sticks? S,T,O,B,S → S at positions 1 and 5? And we need position 5 to be a new letter? But if S is already at position 1, having S at position 5 would be a repeat? But the feedback didn't indicate multiple S. However, it is possible.

But we need to check if S at position 5 is allowed: from previous, S cannot be at position 5? Because in ""plots"" we put S at position 5 and it was (-), meaning S is not at position 5. Therefore, we cannot have S at position 5.

Therefore, ""STOBS"" has S at position 5 → invalid.

Similarly, we cannot have S at position 4 or 5 → only positions 1 or 2. But here position 5 is not allowed.

Therefore, for ""STO__"" the last two positions cannot be S ∴ must be other available letters.

Similarly, T cannot be at position 4 or 5.

So the last two positions must be new letters that are not S or T.

Thus, possibilities:
""STOGY"": S,T,O,G,Y → positions: S1, T2, O3, G4, Y5 → letters: G and Y are available? Yes. And the word ""stogy"" is valid (cigars).

Another: ""STOUK""? U and K → ""stouk"" is Scottish? Maybe not common.

""STOUSH"" etc., but not standard.

""STOFF"" → F? Not great.

But ""stogy"" seems plausible.

Similarly, other words: ""STOUM"" but M excluded.

Case 2: ""TSO__"" → T S O _ _

Words like ""TSOTS""? Not valid.

""TSOOR""? Not familiar.

Common words: ""TSUBO"" → T,S,U,B,O → but O is at position 5? Positions: T1, S2, O3? But position 3 is O, so it would be T1,S2,O3,U4,B5 → and O at position 3 is correct? Yes.

So ""TSOUB""? Not familiar. But ""Tsubo"" might be accepted as unit, but let's stick to common words.

Another: ""TSADI"" → but A excluded? A absent.

""TSARS"" → S again? But we need to avoid S and T in positions 4-5.

""TSARS"" has S at position 4 and 5? But we cannot have S at position 4 → invalid.

""TSKED"" → E excluded.

Therefore, the most plausible for case 1 is ""STOGY"".

But we also have Case 2: T S O _ _, so letters after O: 4 and 5.

For example: ""TSOKE""? Not common.

Perhaps not many words in English start with ""TSO..."". 

We have ""TSOOR""? Scrabbly.

Common is ""tsaddik"" but longer.

Therefore, Case 1 ""STO..."" is more productive.

Other possibilities for STO__: 
- ""STOGY"" as above.
- ""STOPS"" → but S at end? We cannot have S at position 5 → invalid.
- ""STOPT"" → T at end? But T is forbidden at position 5 → invalid.
- ""STOUR"" → R excluded? R from ""crane"" is absent → invalid.
- ""STOUP"" → P excluded? P was guessed in ""plots"" and absent → invalid.
- ""STOOK"" → O and K? ""STOOK"": S,T,O,O,K → two O's? And O at position 3 and also position 4? But position 3 is O (fixed), position 4 cannot be O? Because we don't know.

Feedback never mentioned multiple O's, but it could be. But let's see if it breaks any constraint.

In ""moist"", O was at position 2 and got (-) → meaning O is in the word but not at position 2. If there is another O at position 4, that would be possible.

But in ""stook"": positions: S1, T2, O3, O4, K5 → O at position 4? But we have no constraint on O at position 4? Only that it is not at position 2.

Also, S at position 1: allowed? Yes.
T at position 2: allowed? Yes (only forbidden positions 4 and 5 for T? T cannot be at 4 or 5, but position 2 is allowed).
Then K at position 5: not excluded? K is available.

But in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got (-). Now, if the secret word has T only at position 2, then position 5 in ""moist"" was a wrong position? Yes.

Similarly, for ""stook"": 
- Position 4: O → if there is an O at position 4, when we guessed ""moist"" with O at position 2, why was it (-)? Because there is another O, but the feedback doesn't indicate multiplicity. So multiple O's are possible.

But we must check: in ""moist"", we had one O at position 2 and got (-). That means that O is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn't say anything about other instances.

Similarly, in ""plots"", O at position 3 got (✓), so position 3 is correct for one O. If there are multiple, that's fine.

Now, for ""stook"":
- We have S at position 1 → allowed.
- T at position 2 → allowed (since T cannot be at 4 or 5, but 2 is ok).
- O at position 3 → correct.
- O at position 4: no constraint? But we didn't test O at position 4? Actually, we tested O at position 2 and 3, but not 4. So it could be present? But the feedback didn't indicate it must be only one.
- K at position 5: must be a letter not excluded.

But we must consider: is O supposed to be at position 4? No constraint against it.

But in ""plots"", when we guessed it, we had O only at position 3, and got ✓, so position 3 is correct. But if there's another O, that would be fine.

Similarly, we need to see if the word exists: ""stook"" is valid (sheaves of grain).

But we have another constraint: what is position 4? In ""plots"", we put T at position 4 and got (-), meaning T is not at position 4. But it doesn't say about O at position 4? We didn't put O there.

Therefore, ""stook"" is possible.

Similarly, we have ""stows""? But S at end → position 5: S not allowed.

""stogs"" → S at end → invalid.

Given that, ""stogy"" (also spelled ""stogy"") and ""stook"" are candidates.

""stogy"": S T O G Y → all positions seem okay? G at position 4? No constraint.

Also, they use new letters: G and Y.

Similarly, ""stook"": O and K? But O is already present? So new letter K.

Now, another word: ""stogy"" is slightly more common? But both are acceptable.

To distinguish: we don't know the position of S and T exactly in ""stook"": S at 1, T at 2, which is same as ""stogy"".

But for position 4 and 5: in ""stogy"" they are G and Y; in ""stook"" they are O and K.

But we have limited guesses left, so we need to choose one.

Another possibility: ""stood"" → D? But O at position 4? But then S T O O D → similar to ""stook"". And ""stood"" has E? No, it doesn't. ""stood"" exists. But positions: S1,T2,O3,O4,D5 → so position 5 is D.

Now, D not excluded.

Therefore, possibilities for ""STO__"":

- ""STOGY"": positions:4=G, 5=Y
- ""STOOD"": positions:4=O, 5=D → O at position 4? That's a second O. And we have T at position 2, which is allowed.

But we also need to consider the other case: T S O _ _

For example: ""TSOES"" → E excluded, S at end and at start? Not good.

""TSOOR"" → O at position 4 again? Position 4: O? And position 5: R? But R excluded.

Not many words? So likely Case 1 is more promising.

Now, back to Case 1: ""STO__"" with 4th and 5th position: must choose from available letters and form valid word.

Other words: ""stoep"" → E excluded.

""stogy"", ""stook"", ""stood"", ""stowp"" → P excluded.

Therefore, good candidates: ""stogy"", ""stook"", ""stood"".

We need to test one.

Considering the feedback: we don't know if there is a second O or not.

Moreover, we have not used some vowels? But U is available.

""stour"" excluded? R not allowed.

Therefore, I'll go with ""stook"" because it uses K, which is a new letter, and we can see.

But ""stogy"" is also fine.

To maximize new letters, ""stogy"" introduces G and Y; ""stook"" introduces K and a second O? But O is already known, so new letter K.

Similarly, ""stood"" introduces D and a second O.

Perhaps ""stogy"" since Y is common?

But let's decide: since O is already known and position fixed, introducing entirely new letters like G and Y might be better than reusing O.

Also, ""stogy"" means cigars, acceptable.

So I'll choose ""stogy"".

But wait: ""stogy"" or ""stogy""? Correct spelling.

So guessed word: stogy

Therefore, <guess>stogy</guess>**Thought Process:**

We have three guesses and feedback so far:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)**  
  All letters absent → Secret word contains none of: C, R, A, N, E.

- **Guess 2: ""moist"" → FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(-)**  
  M and I absent → Exclude M and I.  
  O, S, T present but in wrong positions: O not pos 2, S not pos 4, T not pos 5.

- **Guess 3: ""plots"" → FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) O(✓) T(-) S(-)**  
  P and L absent → Exclude P and L.  
  O correct at position 3!  
  T and S present but wrong positions: T not pos 4, S not pos 5.

**Key deductions:**
- **Confirmed letters:**  
  - O is fixed at position 3 (from ""plots"" ✓).  
  - S and T are in the word (from ""moist"" and ""plots"" -), but positions unknown.
- **Known constraints for S and T:**  
  - S cannot be at pos 4 (from ""moist"") or pos 5 (from ""plots"") → S must be at pos 1 or 2.  
  - T cannot be at pos 4 (from ""plots"") or pos 5 (from ""moist"") → T must be at pos 1 or 2.  
- **Excluded letters:** C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L → 9 letters excluded.  
- **Available letters:** B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (14 letters).  
- **Secret word structure:**  
  Positions 1 and 2 must be filled by S and T (in some order), position 3 is O, positions 4 and 5 require two new letters from the available list.

**Possible secret words:**  
- **Case 1: S at position 1, T at position 2 → Structure: S T O _ _**  
  Words like ""STOGY"" (S,T,O,G,Y), ""STOOD"" (S,T,O,O,D), or ""STOOK"" (S,T,O,O,K). ""STOMP"" or ""STONE"" invalid due to excluded letters.  
- **Case 2: T at position 1, S at position 2 → Structure: T S O _ _**  
  Few valid options (e.g., ""TSOBO"" not common), so Case 1 is more promising.

**Selected guess: ""STOGY""**  
- **Why?**  
  - Tests the common S-first/T-second order.  
  - Uses two new available letters (G and Y) to maximize information.  
  - Avoids repeated letters and excluded characters.  
  - Valid English word (""stogy"" meaning a type of cigar).  
- **Positions:**  
  - S at pos 1 (allowed since S ≠ pos 4 or 5).  
  - T at pos 2 (allowed since T ≠ pos 4 or 5).  
  - O at pos 3 (confirmed correct).  
  - G at pos 4 and Y at pos 5 (both untested letters).  

If feedback shows ✓ for S or T positions, we lock in their locations. Otherwise, we confirm the alternative order (T S O _ _) for future guesses.

But O is at position 3, S at 4, T at 5? \n  - However, in ""moist"", we have S at position 4 and T at position 5 and they were marked wrong position. So in ""ghost"":\n    - Position 4: S (but we cannot have S at position 4 because feedback said S is in the word but not at position 4).\n    - Similarly, T is at position 5 which is not allowed.\n  - So ""ghost"" is invalid because S and T are in the forbidden positions.\n\nAlternatively, ""boost"" -> B,O,O,S,T. But two O\'s? Let\'s check:\n  - Positions: B(1), O(2), O(3), S(4), T(5)\n  - But O is at position 2 -> we cannot have O at position 2 (from ""moist"" feedback). Also S at 4 and T at 5 are forbidden. So not good.\n\n""posts"" -> P,O,S,T,S -> but 5 letters? ""POSTS"" is a valid word? Yes, meaning stakes.\n- Positions: P(1), O(2), S(3), T(4), S(5)\n- Now, O is at position 2 -> forbidden for O. S is at position 3 and also at 5, but the feedback only says S is present and not at position 4. It doesn\'t say anything about other positions. However, we must avoid O at position 2. So post is O at 2 -> invalid.\n\nWe need a word where O is not in position 2, S not in position 4, T not in position 5.\n\nLet me try to list positions:\n\nWe have O, S, T to place, each must be in a new position.\n\nPossible positions for O: 1,3,4,5 (but not 2)\nFor S: 1,2,3,5 (but not 4)\nFor T: 1,2,3,4 (but not 5)\n\nBut they must be in a single word, so we need to assign positions to O, S, T and also two more letters.\n\nAlso, since S and T are present, and O, we have 3 known letters.\n\nNow, we don\'t know if there is another O or something? But so far only one O indicated? But feedback doesn\'t say multiple. We have to be cautious.\n\nIn feedback, when a letter is repeated, it might be handled differently, but in this case we haven\'t encountered repetition.\n\nLet me try to think of words:\n\n- ""stomp"" -> but M is excluded. We cannot use M.\n\n- ""stow"" is only 4 letters. We need 5.\n\n- ""spots"": S, P, O, T, S -> but two S\'s? Let me see:\n  Positions: S(1), P(2), O(3), T(4), S(5)\n  Check against constraints:\n    O at position 3: allowed (not position 2)\n    S at position 1 and 5: allowed (only forbidden for S is position 4)\n    T at position 4: allowed (forbidden only position 5 for T)\n\nSo ""spots"" might be a candidate. But note we have two S\'s. The feedback from ""moist"" had S present, but it didn\'t specify the count. It could be one or more.\n\nHowever, we must avoid excluded letters: S, P, O, T, S -> letters: S, P, O, T. None of these are in the excluded set (C,R,A,N,E,M,I). So it\'s okay.\n\nBut let\'s check: the word ""spots"" has two S\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two S\'s or not. But it could be possible.\n\nAlternatively, ""stout"": S, T, O, U, T -> two T\'s? Letters: S, T, O, U, T -> U is allowed? U is not excluded. Positions: S(1), T(2), O(3), U(4), T(5)\nNow constraints:\n  O at 3: allowed (not 2)\n  S at 1: allowed (not restricted except not position 4? and 1 is okay)\n  T at 2 and 5: but T at 5 is forbidden? We cannot have T at position 5? Yes, so T at position 5 is not allowed. So ""stout"" has T at position 5 -> invalid.\n\n""joust"": J, O, U, S, T -> positions: J(1), O(2) -> O cannot be at position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> O at position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""focus"": F, O, C, U, S -> but C is excluded! Cannot use C.\n\n""fluid"": F, L, U, I, D -> but I is excluded.\n\n""fonts"": F, O, N, T, S -> but N is excluded from first feedback -> N(x) so N not in word.\n\n""knots"": K, N, O, T, S -> N excluded.\n\nWe need to avoid C,R,A,N,E,M,I. So avoid any word with these.\n\nBack to ""spots"": it seemed okay? Letters: S, P, O, T, S -> no excluded letters.\n\nPositions: \n- S at 1: okay\n- P at 2: not known, but allowed\n- O at 3: okay (not position 2)\n- T at 4: okay (forbidden is only position 5 for T)\n- S at 5: okay\n\nSo ""spots"" meets the constraints.\n\nAnother candidate: ""posts"" is P,O,S,T,S -> same as ""spots"" but rearranged.\n\n""posts"": P(1), O(2), S(3), T(4), S(5)\nBut O is at position 2 -> forbidden. So not allowed.\n\nSo ""posts"" has O at position 2 -> invalid.\n\nBut ""spots"" has S at 1, P at 2, O at 3, T at 4, S at 5 -> no O at 2.\n\nWhat about ""boots""? B,O,O,T,S? That has two O\'s? Positions: B(1),O(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)\nO at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""costs""? But C and S? C excluded.\n\n""tousy""? Not a common word.\n\n""stops"": S, T, O, P, S -> positions: S(1),T(2),O(3),P(4),S(5)\nCheck:\n  O at 3: ok\n  S at 1 and 5: ok (not position 4)\n  T at 2: ok (only forbidden position for T is position 5)\nAlso, P at 4: we don\'t have any constraint against P at 4? So okay.\n\nSo ""stops"" seems valid? But it has S at position 1, T at 2, O at 3, P at 4, S at 5.\n\nWe need to compare with feedback: we know S is not at position 4, and T not at position 5, which is satisfied here.\n\nSimilarly, ""spots"" also: S(1),P(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)\n\nNow, both ""spots"" and ""stops"" are candidates.\n\nBut note: we also have O, which is known to be present, and in ""stops"" O is at position 3, and in ""spots"" also at position 3.\n\nBoth have S at the beginning and end.\n\nOther candidate: ""plots""? P,L,O,T,S -> positions: P(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)\nAgain, O at 3, T at 4, S at 5 -> S at position 5 is allowed? Only forbidden for S is position 4, so position 5 is okay.\n\nBut S is at position 5, not 4.\n\nSimilarly, all constraints satisfied.\n\nAnother candidate: ""shots"": S,H,O,T,S -> positions: S(1),H(2),O(3),T(4),S(5) -> same pattern.\n\nAll these seem okay? But we need to choose one.\n\nWe also can consider ""south"" or something? ""south"": S,O,U,T,H -> positions: S(1),O(2),U(3),T(4),H(5)\nBut O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.\n\n""fists""? No O.\n\nWe must include O, S, T.\n\nSo ""sloth"": S,L,O,T,H -> positions: S(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),H(5)\nAgain, L at position 2? That\'s allowed? O at 3, T at 4, H at 5: no constraint violated.\n\nBut ""sloth"" avoids excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,I -> L,H,O,S,T are not excluded.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, among these candidates: ""spots"", ""stops"", ""plots"", ""shots"", ""sloth"", etc.\n\nWhich one to choose? Since we have O, S, T as known, and we are trying to locate their positions, and test new letters.\n\nWe might want to test letters that have not been used yet to gain more information.\n\nFrom first guess: we used C,R,A,N,E -> all absent.\nSecond guess: M,O,I,S,T -> O,S,T present, M,I absent.\n\nSo far, the letters we have used: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,I,S,T.\n\nTherefore, new letters would be: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nIn ""spots"": it uses S,O,T (known present) and P (new) and again S.\n\nSimilarly, ""stops"": same letters: S,O,T,P and S.\n\n""plots"": P,L,O,T,S -> S,O,T known, and P,L new.\n\n""shots"": S,H,O,T,S -> S,O,T known, and H new.\n\n""sloth"": S,L,O,T,H -> S,O,T known, and L,H new.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word with as many new letters as possible, but since S,O,T are already present, we can test different positions and new letters.\n\nIdeally, we cover new consonants in positions that might be correct.\n\nGiven that, ""plots"" uses two new letters: P and L.\n\n""shots"" uses one new letter: H.\n\n""sloth"" uses two: L and H.\n\n""spots"" uses one new letter: P.\n\nSo words like ""plots"" or ""sloth"" are better because they test two new letters.\n\nBut in ""plots"": \n- Position 1: P (new)\n- Position 2: L (new)\n- Position 3: O (we know O is present, but we are testing if position 3 is correct for O? Not exactly, but if we get a ✓ for O at position 3, that\'s good; but if not, we know it\'s not at position 3 either)\n\nSimilarly with ""sloth"".\n\nAnother candidate: ""gloats""? But that would be 6 letters? ""gloat"" is 5? ""GLOAT"" is 5: G,L,O,A,T -> A is excluded! Cannot.\n\n""blots"": B,L,O,T,S -> letters: B,L,O,T,S -> none excluded? Positions: B(1),L(2),O(3),T(4),S(5)\n\nSo ""blots"" is also a candidate: B and L new.\n\nNow, let me list the candidates:\n- spots: uses P (new), and S,O,T at positions: S1, O3, T4\n- stops: S1,T2,O3,P4,S5 -> T at position 2? And P at 4? Let me not use stops because T is at position 2 which is new to test.\n- but stops: letters S,T,O,P,S -> same as spots but different arrangement? Actually stops: S,T,O,P,S -> positions: S at1, T at2, O at3, P at4, S at5 -> so placing T at 2 and P at4.\n\nSimilarly, plots: positions P1,L2,O3,T4,S5 -> O and T fixed at 3 and 4? But we don\'t know if they are correct.\n\nActually, all these have O at position 3 and T at position 4? In plots, O at3, T at4? Yes.\n\nBut the feedback only said that O is not at position 2, but it could be at position 1,3,4,5? Similarly for others.\n\nBut in candidates like ""plots"", we are placing O at position 3. If the feedback shows ✓ for O, then it\'s correct; otherwise not.\n\nI think it\'s fine.\n\nBut to be systematic, since O was in position 2 and was wrong, and now we try position 3.\n\nSimilarly, S was in position 4 and wrong, now in ""plots"" S is at position 5. T was in position 5 and wrong, now at position 4? Let\'s see:\n\nIn ""moist"":\n   Position 4: S was wrong -> so S not at 4.\n   Position 5: T was wrong -> so T not at 5.\n\nIn ""plots"":\n   S is at position 5 -> not position 4, so okay.\n   T is at position 4 -> not position 5, so okay.\n\nBut position 4 for T: now we don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly, O at position 3.\n\nAlso, we are testing L at position 2 and P at position 1.\n\nI think ""plots"" is a good word.\n\nAnother candidate: ""fonts"" but N excluded -> invalid.\n\n""pouts"": P,O,U,T,S -> positions: P1,O2,U3,T4,S5 -> but O at position 2 -> forbidden -> invalid.\n\nSo, ""plots"" seems solid.\n\nLet me confirm if ""plots"" is a valid word: yes, meaning small pieces of ground? Or schemes.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""plots"".\n\nGuessed word: plots\n\nSo the response should be: <guess>plots</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- ""crane"" had all letters incorrect (C, R, A, N, E excluded).\n- ""moist"" showed:\n  - M and I absent (so M and I are excluded).\n  - O, S, and T present but in wrong positions (so O not in position 2, S not in position 4, T not in position 5).\n\nThe secret word must contain O, S, T (but not in their guessed positions) and avoid C, R, A, N, E, M, I.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include O, S, T properly placed (O ≠ pos2, S ≠ pos4, T ≠ pos5).\n- Use new letters to test uncovered possibilities.\n- Avoid excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I.\n\nOptimal word choice: ""PLOTS""\n- P and L are new letters (not tested before).\n- Positions:\n  - O in position 3 (not 2) → valid.\n  - S in position 5 (not 4) → valid.\n  - T in position 4 (not 5) → valid.\n- Valid 5-letter word (e.g., defined as small areas or schemes).\n- Maximizes information by introducing two new letters (P and L) while satisfying known constraints.\n\n<guess>plots</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(-) I(x) S(-) T(-)\nGuess 3: plots -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) O(✓) T(-) S(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have three guesses and their feedback:\n\n1.

""plots"":\n   - P: absent (x) → P not in word.\n   - L: absent (x) → L not in word.\n   - O: correct position (✓) → O is at position 3.\n   - T: present but wrong position (-) → T in word but not at position 4.\n   - S: present but wrong position (-) → S in word but not at position 5.\n\nSummary of knowns:\n- Correct position: O is at position 3 (since it got ✓ in position 3 of ""plots"").\n- Present letters (but position unknown): S and T are confirmed present, but their positions are not yet known. From ""plots"", T is not at position 4 and S is not at position 5.\n- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L.\n- From ""plots"": O is at position 3 (fixed), so positions 1, 2, 4, 5 are for other letters.\n\nSecret word structure: _ _ O _ _\n\nNow, we know:\n- Letters in the word: O (at position 3), S, T, and two more letters not excluded.\n- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L → So excluded so far: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L.\n- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and we know S and T must be placed.\n\nFrom feedback:\n- In ""moist"", T was not at position 5 → T can be in positions 1,2,4. But in ""plots"", T was at position 4 and got (-), so T is not at position 4 either. Therefore, T cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Possible positions for T: 1 or 2.\n- Similarly, S was not at position 4 in ""moist"", and not at position 5 in ""plots"". So S cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Possible positions for S: 1 or 2.\n\nBut positions 1 and 2 are only two positions, and we need to place both S and T? But there are two positions (1 and 2) and two letters (S and T), so they must be in positions 1 and 2, in some order.\n\nHowever, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 3 is O. Positions 4 and 5 are open for two more letters, but we have S and T to place? Wait no: S and T are the remaining confirmed letters, but we also need two more letters because the word has 5 letters and we only have O, S, T. So there must be two additional letters.\n\nWe have exactly 3 known present letters: O, S, T. But O is fixed at position 3. S and T must be placed in positions 1,2,4,5 but with constraints:\n- S cannot be in position 4 or 5? From feedback:\n  - ""moist"": S was at position 4 → (-), so not at 4.\n  - ""plots"": S was at position 5 → (-), so not at 5.\n  - Therefore S cannot be at positions 4 or 5 → must be at position 1 or 2.\n\nSimilarly T:\n  - ""moist"": T at position 5 → (-), not at 5.\n  - ""plots"": T at position 4 → (-), not at 4.\n  - Therefore T cannot be at positions 4 or 5 → must be at position 1 or 2.\n\nBut positions 1 and 2 are the only options for both S and T? That would imply that S and T are occupying positions 1 and 2, but then positions 4 and 5 would need to have two more letters? But we only have O, S, T? No, we must have two more letters that are not yet identified.\n\nYes: the secret word has five distinct letters? Or could have repeats? We don\'t know, but so far no indication of repeats.\n\nWe have confirmed only three letters: O, S, T. But O is at position 3, and S and T must be in the word, but not in positions 4 or 5, so they must be in positions 1 or 2. However, positions 1 and 2 can\'t both hold two letters? Positions 1 and 2 are two positions, so one of them must have S and the other T? We can place S at 1 and T at 2, or S at 2 and T at 1.\n\nThen positions 4 and 5 must be two new letters that are not S, T, O and not excluded.\n\nTherefore, the word structure must be:\nPosition 1: either S or T\nPosition 2: either T or S\nPosition 3: O\nPosition 4: unknown letter (not S, T, O, and not excluded)\nPosition 5: unknown letter (not S, T, O, and not excluded)\n\nAlso, excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L → available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need a valid 5-letter word that fits:\n- First, S and T must be at positions 1 and 2 in some order.\n- Then, letters for positions 4 and 5 must be from the available list.\n\nLet\'s consider possibilities:\n\nCase 1: S at position 1, T at position 2 → word: S T O _ _\nCase 2: T at position 1, S at position 2 → word: T S O _ _\n\nNow, we need to fill the last two positions with letters from available: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nMoreover, the word must exist.\n\nFor Case 1: ""STO__"" words?\nCommon words: \n- ""STOCK"" → but C excluded.\n- ""STONE"" → E excluded.\n- ""STOVE"" → E excluded? Also V allowed.\n- ""STOMP"" → M excluded.\n- ""STOVE"" is invalid because E is excluded? First guess E(x).\n\nOther possibilities: \n- ""STOUT"" → T repeated? But we don\'t know. Also U: not excluded? But positions: S T O U T → That would have T at positions 2 and 5? But in this case position 5 is T. However, we have feedback from ""moist"": T was at 5 and said wrong position → but if T is at 5, why would it be (-)? Only if there is another T? Or if a single T is not at 5? Actually, if T is at position 5, and we guessed T at position 5, it should be (✓). Therefore, since it was (-) in ""moist"", then T cannot be at position 5. So ""stout"" would have T at position 5 → which is forbidden? But if it is a repeated T and one is at 5, it might be marked differently? But the rules don\'t specify how repeats are handled, but probably for exact position if it matches it should be ✓.\n\nLooking back at feedback:\n\nIn ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got (-), meaning that T is in the word but not at position 5. So regardless of repetition, position 5 cannot be T. Therefore, ""stout"" has T at position 5 → invalid if we need T to be absent from position 5.\n\nSimilarly, any word with T at position 5 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, ""stout"" doesn\'t work due to T at position 5.\n\nSimilarly: ""STOMA"" → O at 3, but A is excluded? ""A"" was in ""crane"" and absent.\n\n""STORE"" → R and E excluded.\n\nSo for ""STO__"": we need the last two letters from available.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""STOBS"" → B is available? But ""STOBS"" is a word? Meaning short sticks? S,T,O,B,S → S at positions 1 and 5? And we need position 5 to be a new letter? But if S is already at position 1, having S at position 5 would be a repeat? But the feedback didn\'t indicate multiple S. However, it is possible.\n\nBut we need to check if S at position 5 is allowed: from previous, S cannot be at position 5? Because in ""plots"" we put S at position 5 and it was (-), meaning S is not at position 5. Therefore, we cannot have S at position 5.\n\nTherefore, ""STOBS"" has S at position 5 → invalid.\n\nSimilarly, we cannot have S at position 4 or 5 → only positions 1 or 2. But here position 5 is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, for ""STO__"" the last two positions cannot be S ∴ must be other available letters.\n\nSimilarly, T cannot be at position 4 or 5.\n\nSo the last two positions must be new letters that are not S or T.\n\nThus, possibilities:\n""STOGY"": S,T,O,G,Y → positions: S1, T2, O3, G4, Y5 → letters: G and Y are available? Yes. And the word ""stogy"" is valid (cigars).\n\nAnother: ""STOUK""? U and K → ""stouk"" is Scottish? Maybe not common.\n\n""STOUSH"" etc., but not standard.\n\n""STOFF"" → F? Not great.\n\nBut ""stogy"" seems plausible.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""STOUM"" but M excluded.\n\nCase 2: ""TSO__"" → T S O _ _\n\nWords like ""TSOTS""? Not valid.\n\n""TSOOR""? Not familiar.\n\nCommon words: ""TSUBO"" → T,S,U,B,O → but O is at position 5? Positions: T1, S2, O3? But position 3 is O, so it would be T1,S2,O3,U4,B5 → and O at position 3 is correct? Yes.\n\nSo ""TSOUB""? Not familiar. But ""Tsubo"" might be accepted as unit, but let\'s stick to common words.\n\nAnother: ""TSADI"" → but A excluded? A absent.\n\n""TSARS"" → S again? But we need to avoid S and T in positions 4-5.\n\n""TSARS"" has S at position 4 and 5? But we cannot have S at position 4 → invalid.\n\n""TSKED"" → E excluded.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible for case 1 is ""STOGY"".\n\nBut we also have Case 2: T S O _ _, so letters after O: 4 and 5.\n\nFor example: ""TSOKE""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps not many words in English start with ""TSO..."". \n\nWe have ""TSOOR""? Scrabbly.\n\nCommon is ""tsaddik"" but longer.\n\nTherefore, Case 1 ""STO..."" is more productive.\n\nOther possibilities for STO__: \n- ""STOGY"" as above.\n- ""STOPS"" → but S at end? We cannot have S at position 5 → invalid.\n- ""STOPT"" → T at end? But T is forbidden at position 5 → invalid.\n- ""STOUR"" → R excluded? R from ""crane"" is absent → invalid.\n- ""STOUP"" → P excluded? P was guessed in ""plots"" and absent → invalid.\n- ""STOOK"" → O and K? ""STOOK"": S,T,O,O,K → two O\'s? And O at position 3 and also position 4? But position 3 is O (fixed), position 4 cannot be O? Because we don\'t know.\n\nFeedback never mentioned multiple O\'s, but it could be. But let\'s see if it breaks any constraint.\n\nIn ""moist"", O was at position 2 and got (-) → meaning O is in the word but not at position 2. If there is another O at position 4, that would be possible.\n\nBut in ""stook"": positions: S1, T2, O3, O4, K5 → O at position 4? But we have no constraint on O at position 4? Only that it is not at position 2.\n\nAlso, S at position 1: allowed? Yes.\nT at position 2: allowed? Yes (only forbidden positions 4 and 5 for T? T cannot be at 4 or 5, but position 2 is allowed).\nThen K at position 5: not excluded? K is available.\n\nBut in ""moist"", T was at position 5 and got (-). Now, if the secret word has T only at position 2, then position 5 in ""moist"" was a wrong position? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, for ""stook"": \n- Position 4: O → if there is an O at position 4, when we guessed ""moist"" with O at position 2, why was it (-)? Because there is another O, but the feedback doesn\'t indicate multiplicity. So multiple O\'s are possible.\n\nBut we must check: in ""moist"", we had one O at position 2 and got (-). That means that O is in the word but not at position 2. It doesn\'t say anything about other instances.\n\nSimilarly, in ""plots"", O at position 3 got (✓), so position 3 is correct for one O. If there are multiple, that\'s fine.\n\nNow, for ""stook"":\n- We have S at position 1 → allowed.\n- T at position 2 → allowed (since T cannot be at 4 or 5, but 2 is ok).\n- O at position 3 → correct.\n- O at position 4: no constraint? But we didn\'t test O at position 4? Actually, we tested O at position 2 and 3, but not 4. So it could be present? But the feedback didn\'t indicate it must be only one.\n- K at position 5: must be a letter not excluded.\n\nBut we must consider: is O supposed to be at position 4? No constraint against it.\n\nBut in ""plots"", when we guessed it, we had O only at position 3, and got ✓, so position 3 is correct. But if there\'s another O, that would be fine.\n\nSimilarly, we need to see if the word exists: ""stook"" is valid (sheaves of grain).\n\nBut we have another constraint: what is position 4? In ""plots"", we put T at position 4 and got (-), meaning T is not at position 4. But it doesn\'t say about O at position 4? We didn\'t put O there.\n\nTherefore, ""stook"" is possible.\n\nSimilarly, we have ""stows""? But S at end → position 5: S not allowed.\n\n""stogs"" → S at end → invalid.\n\nGiven that, ""stogy"" (also spelled ""stogy"") and ""stook"" are candidates.\n\n""stogy"": S T O G Y → all positions seem okay? G at position 4? No constraint.\n\nAlso, they use new letters: G and Y.\n\nSimilarly, ""stook"": O and K? But O is already present? So new letter K.\n\nNow, another word: ""stogy"" is slightly more common? But both are acceptable.\n\nTo distinguish: we don\'t know the position of S and T exactly in ""stook"": S at 1, T at 2, which is same as ""stogy"".\n\nBut for position 4 and 5: in ""stogy"" they are G and Y; in ""stook"" they are O and K.\n\nBut we have limited guesses left, so we need to choose one.\n\nAnother possibility: ""stood"" → D? But O at position 4? But then S T O O D → similar to ""stook"". And ""stood"" has E? No, it doesn\'t. ""stood"" exists. But positions: S1,T2,O3,O4,D5 → so position 5 is D.\n\nNow, D not excluded.\n\nTherefore, possibilities for ""STO__"":\n\n- ""STOGY"": positions:4=G, 5=Y\n- ""STOOD"": positions:4=O, 5=D → O at position 4? That\'s a second O. And we have T at position 2, which is allowed.\n\nBut we also need to consider the other case: T S O _ _\n\nFor example: ""TSOES"" → E excluded, S at end and at start? Not good.\n\n""TSOOR"" → O at position 4 again? Position 4: O? And position 5: R? But R excluded.\n\nNot many words? So likely Case 1 is more promising.\n\nNow, back to Case 1: ""STO__"" with 4th and 5th position: must choose from available letters and form valid word.\n\nOther words: ""stoep"" → E excluded.\n\n""stogy"", ""stook"", ""stood"", ""stowp"" → P excluded.\n\nTherefore, good candidates: ""stogy"", ""stook"", ""stood"".\n\nWe need to test one.\n\nConsidering the feedback: we don\'t know if there is a second O or not.\n\nMoreover, we have not used some vowels? But U is available.\n\n""stour"" excluded? R not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""stook"" because it uses K, which is a new letter, and we can see.\n\nBut ""stogy"" is also fine.\n\nTo maximize new letters, ""stogy"" introduces G and Y; ""stook"" introduces K and a second O? But O is already known, so new letter K.\n\nSimilarly, ""stood"" introduces D and a second O.\n\nPerhaps ""stogy"" since Y is common?\n\nBut let\'s decide: since O is already known and position fixed, introducing entirely new letters like G and Y might be better than reusing O.\n\nAlso, ""stogy"" means cigars, acceptable.\n\nSo I\'ll choose ""stogy"".\n\nBut wait: ""stogy"" or ""stogy""?

We have feedback from the fourth guess ""stogy"":
- S(✓) at position 1: correct and in position.
- T(✓) at position 2: correct and in position.
- O(✓) at position 3: correct and in position (already known).
- G(x) at position 4: absent, so G is not in the word.
- Y(x) at position 5: absent, so Y is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word starts with ""STO"" and has two more letters at positions 4 and 5.

We know:
- Positions 1,2,3: S, T, O (fixed).
- Positions 4 and 5: two letters that are not G, Y, and not any of the previously excluded letters.

Previously excluded letters: from guesses 1-4, we have excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L, G, Y.

List of excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L, G, Y.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (Note: S, T, O are in the word but already placed, so for positions 4 and 5, we need new letters from the available set.)

The secret word is ""STO"" followed by two letters from the available set.

We need to form a valid 5-letter word.

Possible words:
- ""STOAT"": but A is excluded (from ""crane"").
- ""STOBS"": B and S? But S is already at position 1, and we cannot have S at position 5? Also, in ""stogy"", we have Y at 5 absent, but S at 5 would be a repeat? However, we don't know if repeats are allowed. But in the feedback, we haven't seen any indication of repeats. Moreover, in ""stogy"", we got S(✓) at 1, so if there were another S, it might have been indicated? But the rules don't specify how repeats are handled. To be safe, we should avoid assuming repeats unless necessary.

But let's check: in ""stogy"", we guessed S at position 1 and got ✓, and we didn't have S elsewhere. Similarly, in previous guesses, no repeats. So perhaps the word has no repeats? But we cannot be sure.

However, to minimize risk, we can first try without repeats.

So for ""STO"" and then two distinct letters from available: B, D, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common words:
- ""STOVE"": but E excluded.
- ""STOOP"": O repeated? But we have O at position 3, so if we put O at position 4, that would be a repeat. But O is not excluded, so it could be. However, we have not tested O at position 4. But in ""stogy"", we didn't have O at 4, so we don't know. But ""STOOP"" has O at position 4? And P is excluded? P was in ""plots"" and absent, so excluded. So ""STOOP"" invalid.

""STOOD"": O at position 4 and D at position 5. But O is repeated? And D is available. But we have excluded? D is not excluded. But ""STOOD"" has two O's? Positions: S1, T2, O3, O4, D5. So O at position 4 is a repeat. But is that allowed? We don't know. Also, in ""moist"", we had O at position 2 and got (-), which doesn't rule out another O. Similarly, in ""plots"", O at 3 got ✓, so if there is another O, it might be at position 4? But we haven't tested it.

But we have to consider: in ""stogy"", we guessed G at position 4 and got (x), so position 4 is not G. Similarly, Y at 5 is not. But we didn't test O at position 4.

So ""STOOD"" is a candidate? But we have to check if O is allowed to be repeated? The feedback doesn't indicate that O is only once. So it could be.

Similarly, ""STOOK"": O at 4 and K at 5? But K is available. ""STOOK"" is a valid word.

But we have G and Y excluded, so ""stook"" is possible.

Other words without O repeat:
- ""STOBA"": A excluded.
- ""STOBI"": I excluded.
- ""STOEP"": E excluded.
- ""STOGY"" we just tried, so not.
- ""STOIC"": C and I excluded.
- ""STOLE"": L and E excluded.
- ""STOLN"": N excluded? N from ""crane"" absent.
- ""STOMA"": M and A excluded.
- ""STOND"": N excluded? N absent.
- ""STONK"": N excluded? ""STONK"" has N? S,T,O,N,K -> N is excluded, so invalid.

Without N: 
- ""STOUD"": not a word? 
- ""STOUP"": P excluded.
- ""STOUR"": R excluded.
- ""STOUT"": T at position 5? But T is already at position 2, and we cannot have T at position 5 because in ""moist"" T at 5 got (-). Also, in ""stogy"", we have T at 2 ✓, so if there is another T at 5, it might be possible? But the feedback for ""moist"" T at 5 was (-), meaning that T is not at position 5. So even if there is a second T, position 5 cannot be T? Actually, the feedback for a repeated letter: if there is one T and it's at position 2, then position 5 is not T, so (-) is correct. If there are two T's, one at 2 and one at 5, then position 5 should be (✓) if we guess T there? But in ""moist"", we guessed T at position 5 and got (-), which means that at position 5, it is not T. Therefore, even if there is a T at position 2, position 5 cannot be T. So ""stout"" is invalid because it has T at position 5.

Similarly, we cannot have T at position 5.

Therefore, for position 5, it cannot be T, and also not S (because S cannot be at position 5 from ""plots"" feedback: S at 5 got (-)).

So position 5 must be a new letter, not S, not T, not O? O could be? But we are considering.

But in ""STOOD"", position 5 is D, which is available.

Similarly, ""STOOK"" position 5 is K.

Now, without repeat: 
- ""STOBA"" invalid.
- ""STOBY"": Y excluded? We just excluded Y in ""stogy"".
- ""STOFA"": F? ""STOFA"" not a word.
- ""STOFF"": F? ""STOFF"" not common.
- ""STOGA"": A excluded.
- ""STOGY"" already tried.

Perhaps ""STUD"": too short.

""STOA"" too short.

So it seems we have to consider words with repeated O or other.

Another word: ""STOUN""? Not common.

""STOWP"": P excluded.

Therefore, the most common words are ""STOOD"" and ""STOOK"".

We also have ""STOVE"" but E excluded.

So between ""STOOD"" and ""STOOK"", we need to choose one.

We can also consider ""STUB"": not 5 letters.

""STUBS"": but S at position 5? We cannot have S at position 5 → invalid.

Similarly, ""STUFF"": F? But position 5 F? But ""STUFF"" has S,T,U,F,F → positions: S1,T2,U3,F4,F5? But we need position 3 to be O, not U. So not.

Therefore, we must have O at position 3.

So back to ""STO__"".

We have ""STOOD"" and ""STOOK"" as candidates.

Also, ""STOOR"": O at 4 and R? But R excluded.

""STOOP"": P excluded and O repeated.

So only a few options.

We can try ""STOOD"" or ""STOOK"".

Since we have no information about D or K, we need to guess.

To decide, we can think about frequency: D is more common than K? But both are possible.

We have not used D or K in previous guesses, so both are untested.

We can choose ""STOOD"" because it's a very common word.

But let's see the feedback: if we guess ""STOOD"", we might get:

- S(✓), T(✓), O(✓), O(?), D(?)

But for the second O at position 4: if it is present, it should be (✓) or (-)? But we don't know if it is in the word.

Similarly for ""STOOK"".

But we have to make a guess.

Since we have only two positions left, and we know the first three, we can guess one of these.

I think ""STOOD"" is a good guess.

But we must check: in ""stogy"", we got G(x) and Y(x), so G and Y are out.

Now, for ""STOOD"": 
- Position 4: O → if the secret word has O at position 4, it would be (✓) or (-)? Since we have O at position 3 already, and if there is another O, it might be marked as present but wrong position if not in the right spot? But position 4 is a new position.

The feedback rules: 
- ✓: correct letter in correct position.
- -: letter in the word but wrong position.
- x: letter not in the word.

So for ""STOOD"":
- Position 1: S → should be ✓ (since we know S is at 1)
- Position 2: T → ✓
- Position 3: O → ✓
- Position 4: O → if the secret word has an O at position 4, then it should be ✓? But if the secret word has only one O (at position 3), then position 4 O would be x? Or if there is a second O, it could be ✓ or -.

But we don't know if there is a second O.

Similarly, position 5: D → if D is in the word, it might be ✓ or -, else x.

But we are guessing to find the word.

Since we have limited options, we can guess ""STOOD"".

But let's see if there is a word without repeat.

Another possibility: ""STOUD""? Not a word.

""STOUND"": too long.

""STOUR"": R excluded.

So I think ""STOOD"" or ""STOOK"" are the main options.

We can also consider ""STOW"" but too short.

""STOWN"": N excluded.

Therefore, I'll go with ""STOOD"".

So guessed word: stood

But we must output in the format.

<guess>stood</guess>

Alternatively, to be safe, we can think of a word that doesn't repeat O? But we don't have many.

""STOIC"" excluded.

""STOMP"" excluded.

So I think ""STOOD"" is fine.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane"" → All letters absent (C, R, A, N, E excluded)**  
- **Guess 2: ""moist"" → M and I absent (excluded); O, S, T present but wrong positions (O not pos 2, S not pos 4, T not pos 5)**  
- **Guess 3: ""plots"" → P and L absent (excluded); O correct at position 3; T and S present but wrong positions (T not pos 4, S not pos 5)**  
- **Guess 4: ""stogy"" → S, T, O correct at positions 1, 2, 3; G and Y absent (excluded)**  

### Key Deductions:
- **Secret word structure:** Starts with ""STO"" (positions 1–3 confirmed).  
- **Excluded letters (13 total):** C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L, G, Y.  
- **Available letters for positions 4–5:** B, D, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Constraints for positions 4–5:**  
  - Cannot be S, T, or O (since positions 1–3 are fixed and no repeats are indicated yet).  
  - Must form a valid English word with ""STO"".  
- **Possible words:** Given constraints, common options include:  
  - ""STOOD"" (O at position 4, D at position 5)  
  - ""STOOK"" (O at position 4, K at position 5)  
  - ""STOUP"" (invalid, P excluded)  
  - ""STOUR"" (invalid, R excluded)  
  - ""STOIC"" (invalid, C and I excluded)  
- **Strategy:**  
  - ""STOOD"" is chosen as it tests a common word with a repeated O (possible but untested) and introduces D (new letter).  
  - If ""STOOD"" is incorrect, feedback on O (position 4) and D (position 5) will confirm/reject repeats or narrow options (e.g., ""STOOK"" as backup).  

<guess>stood</guess>",stood,"We have feedback from the fourth guess ""stogy"":
- S(✓) at position 1: correct and in position.

- G(x) at position 4: absent, so G is not in the word.

- Positions 4 and 5: two letters that are not G, Y, and not any of the previously excluded letters.

Previously excluded letters: from guesses 1-4, we have excluded: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L, G, Y.

List of excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, I, P, L, G, Y.

Available letters: B, D, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z. (Note: S, T, O are in the word but already placed, so for positions 4 and 5, we need new letters from the available set.)

The secret word is ""STO"" followed by two letters from the available set.

We need to form a valid 5-letter word.

Possible words:
- ""STOAT"": but A is excluded (from ""crane"").
- ""STOBS"": B and S? But S is already at position 1, and we cannot have S at position 5? Also, in ""stogy"", we have Y at 5 absent, but S at 5 would be a repeat?

So for ""STO"" and then two distinct letters from available: B, D, F, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.

Common words:
- ""STOVE"": but E excluded.
- ""STOOP"": O repeated? But we have O at position 3, so if we put O at position 4, that would be a repeat. But O is not excluded, so it could be. However, we have not tested O at position 4. But in ""stogy"", we didn't have O at 4, so we don't know. But ""STOOP"" has O at position 4? And P is excluded? P was in ""plots"" and absent, so excluded. So ""STOOP"" invalid.

""STOOD"": O at position 4 and D at position 5. But O is repeated? And D is available. But we have excluded? D is not excluded. But ""STOOD"" has two O's? Positions: S1, T2, O3, O4, D5. So O at position 4 is a repeat. But is that allowed? We don't know. Also, in ""moist"", we had O at position 2 and got (-), which doesn't rule out another O. Similarly, in ""plots"", O at 3 got ✓, so if there is another O, it might be at position 4? But we haven't tested it.

But we have to consider: in ""stogy"", we guessed G at position 4 and got (x), so position 4 is not G. Similarly, Y at 5 is not. But we didn't test O at position 4.

So ""STOOD"" is a candidate? But we have to check if O is allowed to be repeated? The feedback doesn't indicate that O is only once. So it could be.

Similarly, ""STOOK"": O at 4 and K at 5? But K is available. ""STOOK"" is a valid word.

But we have G and Y excluded, so ""stook"" is possible.

Other words without O repeat:

- ""STOEP"": E excluded.
- ""STOGY"" we just tried, so not.

Without N: 
- ""STOUD"": not a word? 
- ""STOUP"": P excluded.
- ""STOUR"": R excluded.
- ""STOUT"": T at position 5? But T is already at position 2, and we cannot have T at position 5 because in ""moist"" T at 5 got (-). Also, in ""stogy"", we have T at 2 ✓, so if there is another T at 5, it might be possible? But the feedback for ""moist"" T at 5 was (-), meaning that T is not at position 5. So even if there is a second T, position 5 cannot be T? Actually, the feedback for a repeated letter: if there is one T and it's at position 2, then position 5 is not T, so (-) is correct. If there are two T's, one at 2 and one at 5, then position 5 should be (✓) if we guess T there? But in ""moist"", we guessed T at position 5 and got (-), which means that at position 5, it is not T. Therefore, even if there is a T at position 2, position 5 cannot be T. So ""stout"" is invalid because it has T at position 5.

Similarly, we cannot have T at position 5.

Therefore, for position 5, it cannot be T, and also not S (because S cannot be at position 5 from ""plots"" feedback: S at 5 got (-)).

So position 5 must be a new letter, not S, not T, not O? O could be? But we are considering.

But in ""STOOD"", position 5 is D, which is available.

Similarly, ""STOOK"" position 5 is K.

Now, without repeat: 
- ""STOBA"" invalid.
- ""STOBY"": Y excluded? We just excluded Y in ""stogy"".
- ""STOFA"": F? ""STOFA"" not a word.
- ""STOFF"": F? ""STOFF"" not common.
- ""STOGA"": A excluded.
- ""STOGY"" already tried.

Perhaps ""STUD"": too short.

""STOA"" too short.

So it seems we have to consider words with repeated O or other.

Another word: ""STOUN""? Not common.

""STOWP"": P excluded.

Therefore, the most common words are ""STOOD"" and ""STOOK"".

We also have ""STOVE"" but E excluded.

So between ""STOOD"" and ""STOOK"", we need to choose one.

We can also consider ""STUB"": not 5 letters.

""STUBS"": but S at position 5? We cannot have S at position 5 → invalid.

Similarly, ""STUFF"": F? But position 5 F? But ""STUFF"" has S,T,U,F,F → positions: S1,T2,U3,F4,F5? But we need position 3 to be O, not U. So not.

Therefore, we must have O at position 3.

So back to ""STO__"".

We have ""STOOD"" and ""STOOK"" as candidates.

Also, ""STOOR"": O at 4 and R? But R excluded.
