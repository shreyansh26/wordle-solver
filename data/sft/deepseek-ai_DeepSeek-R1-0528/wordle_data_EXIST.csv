We are making the first guess. Since this is the beginning, we have no prior feedback.
 A good starting word is one that has common letters and maximizes the information gain. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""CRATE"" are often recommended by Wordle enthusiasts because they include common vowels and consonants.

 I am going to choose ""SLATE"" because:
 - It includes two common vowels: 'A' and 'E'
 - It includes three common consonants: 'S', 'L', 'T'
 - These letters are frequently found in 5-letter English words.

 Therefore, my first guess is ""SLATE"".

 We'll output it in the required format.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. 

The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- It contains three common vowels: 'A' and 'E' (with 'A' being the most frequently occurring vowel).
- It includes three common consonants: 'C', 'R', and 'N' (all ranked within the top 15 most frequent letters in English).
- The letters are distinct, which helps test five unique positions.

This choice efficiently narrows down potential secret words based on the feedback we receive.

We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since it was guessed in the last position and got a minus, meaning it's elsewhere).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are definitely not in the word.

 Since E is present but not in the last position, we should guess a word that includes E in one of the first four positions, and avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Also, we should aim to include other common letters to maximize information. Common letters not yet tested include: S, T, O, U, L, D, H, I, etc.

 Let's think of words that have E in positions 1-4 and contain other common untested letters.

 Possible positions for E: it can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know from the absence of C, R, A, N that the secret word cannot contain any of these.

 Since E is the only known letter so far, we need a word that uses E and adds new common letters.

 Example: 
   Trying a word with E in the second position? Like ""SLEPT"", but note we haven't tested S, L, P, T.

 However, let's check our constraints: 
 Cannot use: C, R, A, N.

 We can use: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we know E is in the word (somewhere except the last), let's prioritize words that place E in a different position than last.

 Let me list some candidate words:
   Positions for E: We want to try E in positions 1,2,3,4 to gain positional information.

 For instance:
   E in position 1 examples: 
     ""E"" _ _ _ _ -> e.g., ""EJECT"" has repeated E and uses J and T? But repeated E might not be ideal? Also, we don't know if there are multiple E's. However, let's avoid repeats for maximum information? But the word might have repeated letters.

 However, we can assume for now that the word might not have repeats? Actually, Wordle words can have repeated letters.

 But for efficiency, we might avoid repeats unless necessary.

 Let me think: 
   We know E is present. But we don't know if there's more than one E. So we should not rule that out.

 However, since we only have 6 tries, we should aim for words with 5 distinct letters to test more.

 Therefore, let's choose a word with E and four new distinct letters, all not C,R,A,N.

 Candidate: 
   Example: ""STEEL"" has repeated E -> not distinct. So skip.
   Another: ""OUCHY"" doesn't have E -> invalid.

 We must include E.

 Another: ""SLEEK"" has repeated E -> less informative.

 So I'll aim for words where E is included and the rest are distinct and new.

 Common word: ""TIMES"": 
   T, I, M, E, S -> distinct, has E in position 4? 
   But E was in position 5 in the first guess and now we are putting it in position 4? That might be good to test.

 However, we know E cannot be in position 5? Actually, the feedback said E was present but not in position 5, so position 5 is ruled out for E. But positions 1-4 are still possible.

 How about ""HOUSE""? 
   H, O, U, S, E -> distinct, E at end? But E cannot be at position 5? Actually, we cannot put E at position 5 because we already know it's not there. So HOUSE would have E in the last position again -> which we know is wrong -> it will give a ""-"" but we already know that. 

   So we should avoid putting E in the fifth position to avoid wasting a letter slot.

 Therefore, we should place E in one of the positions: 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let's try E in position 4? 
   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S T O L E: E is in position 5 -> same problem.

 We need to put E in positions 1,2, or 3? 

 Word: ""STEAM"" -> E in position 3? STEAM: 
   S, T, E, A, M -> but A is already ruled out! Because we got A(x) in first guess. 

 So we cannot use A.

 How about ""STEPS"": 
   S, T, E, P, S -> repeated S? And S at positions 1 and 5? That's two letters? So let's avoid repeats.

 Another: ""DEPOT"": 
   D, E, P, O, T -> distinct letters, E in position 2? This seems good.
   Letters: D, E, P, O, T -> none are C,R,A,N.

 But we haven't tested D, P, O, T yet. 

 Another good word: ""DOZEN"": 
   D, O, Z, E, N -> however, N is ruled out, so we can't use N.

 We must avoid N.

 How about ""PLEAD"": 
   P, L, E, A, D -> but A is ruled out.

 So let's avoid A.

 Another: ""MODEL"": 
   M, O, D, E, L -> distinct? M, O, D, E, L -> yes. And E is in position 4? 
   Positions: M (1), O (2), D (3), E (4), L (5). 
   Since E is in position 4 and we know it's not in 5, but position 4 might be a new position.

 However, note: the secret word has E in another position, but we don't know if position 4 is the correct one? So it's okay to test.

 But let me see if there's a better word: 
   ""MEDIC"" -> contains C, ruled out.

 Another: ""FIELD"": 
   F, I, E, L, D -> distinct, E in position 3?

 But let me think: we want to cover more vowels or common letters. 

 We haven't tried L, O, T? 

 Considering ""DOZEN"" is invalid (has N). How about ""WOVEN""? again has N.

 Another common word: ""OILED"": 
   O, I, L, E, D -> distinct, E in position 4? 
   Or ""TOWEL"": has E at position 4? 

 But note: ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> distinct, and E in position 4.

 How about ""POISE"": 
   P, O, I, S, E -> distinct? Yes. But E is at the end - position 5 -> not allowed.

 So words ending with E are no good for our purpose? Because we'll get an immediate ""minus"" but we already know E isn't in last.

 But if we put E in position 5 again, then we are wasting the last letter slot? So let's avoid.

 After avoiding position 5 for E, I can use words that have E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Now, let's find a word with E in position 1? 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" ... -> ""EPOXY"": E, P, O, X, Y -> distinct? Yes. And X and Y are less common? 
     ""ELITE"": repeated E -> less distinct letters.

 Another: ""ETHIC"": has C -> invalid.

 ""EDGES"": repeated E? And S at end? 
   But E at position 1 and then at the end? Avoid repeated? 

 How about ""ENSUE""? repeated E? 

 I think ""MODEL"" is a decent choice: positions 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L -> so E in position 4.

 Or ""DIET"": too short, need 5 letters.

 Let me go with ""MODEL"": 
   M, O, D, E, L -> all new distinct letters, E in position 4.

 But note: if E is in the secret word and is not in position 5, but we put it in position 4, we'll get:
   - If it is in position 4: then we get a ""✓""
   - If it is in position 1,2, or 3: then we get ""-"" for position 4.

 So we will get more information.

 Alternatively, we might try to put E in a completely different position? For example, first guess E was in position 5, so let's try position 1? 

 Another candidate: ""ELOPE"": E in position 1? But has repeated E? 

 ""ESCORT"" has C -> invalid.

 ""EXIST"": E in position 1? X, I, S, T -> distinct? Yes. 
   Letters: E, X, I, S, T -> avoid S? Why? We haven't tested S yet. 

 I think ""EXIST"" is a possible word.

 But note: we can use words even with less common letters? 

 Considering commonality: 
   Common letters: S, T, I, O, L, etc. 

 ""EXIST"" has E, X, I, S, T -> X is very infrequent.

 How about ""LOUIE"": has repeated I? Not distinct.

 Another: ""QUIET"": Q and E - Q is less common? 

 After review, I think ""MODEL"" is acceptable.

 But another idea: we might try ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> distinct? Yes. E in position 4? 
   Or ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E in position 5 -> not allowed.

 ""SPIEL"": E in position 4.

 ""SLIDE"": 
   S, L, I, D, E -> E in position 5? No.

 ""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E -> contains C and repeated E -> invalid.

 I'll go with ""MODEL"": 
   We test M, O, D, E, L -> E in position 4.

 Or ""POISE"" but ends with E -> avoid.

 Alternative: ""TIMER"": 
   T, I, M, E, R -> distinct? Yes. E in position 4? 
   But R was already ruled out by first guess! Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position 2 and got ""x"", so R is not in the word.

 So we cannot use R.

 So in my next guess I must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Therefore, ""TIMER"" is invalid because of R.

 Similarly, we must ensure we avoid C, R, A, N.

 Now, back to ""MODEL"": 
   Contains M, O, D, E, L -> safe.

 We can also consider ""BIKED"": but has K? 
   ""BIKED"": B, I, K, E, D -> distinct, E in position 4? 

 But note: we haven't tested B, I, K, D either.

 However, ""MODEL"" seems more common.

 Another common word: ""GOURD"": but missing E? 

 We must include E? Yes, because we need to figure out where E is.

 We are required to guess a valid English word. 

 After thinking, I'll choose ""MODEL"".

 Let me confirm if ""MODEL"" is a valid word: yes.

 So guess: MODEL
</think>
<thought>
Previous feedback for ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-).  
This means:  
- Letters C, R, A, N are ABSENT from the secret word.  
- Letter E is PRESENT but not in the 5th position (since it was guessed there and got ""-"").  
- The secret word contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.  

For the next guess:  
- Must include E in a position other than 5 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4) to test its location.  
- Must avoid using C, R, A, N entirely.  
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, D, I, M) to maximize information.  

Considering words with E in position 4 to test a new spot while including other common letters:  
- ""MODEL"": Places E in position 4 (new position to test), uses distinct unused letters (M, O, D, E, L), all valid.  
- Alternatives like ""TIMES"" (E in pos 4) invalid due to R; ""POISE"" (E in pos 5) invalid as E can't be in pos 5; ""STEAM"" invalid due to A.  
""MODEL"" efficiently tests E in position 4 and introduces M, O, D, L.

<guess>model</guess>",model,"We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since it was guessed in the last position and got a minus, meaning it's elsewhere).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are definitely not in the word.

 Since E is present but not in the last position, we should guess a word that includes E in one of the first four positions, and avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Possible positions for E: it can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know from the absence of C, R, A, N that the secret word cannot contain any of these.

 But for efficiency, we might avoid repeats unless necessary.

   We know E is present. But we don't know if there's more than one E. So we should not rule that out.

 However, since we only have 6 tries, we should aim for words with 5 distinct letters to test more.

 Therefore, let's choose a word with E and four new distinct letters, all not C,R,A,N.

 Candidate: 
   Example: ""STEEL"" has repeated E -> not distinct. So skip.
   Another: ""OUCHY"" doesn't have E -> invalid.

 We must include E.

 Another: ""SLEEK"" has repeated E -> less informative.

 So I'll aim for words where E is included and the rest are distinct and new.

 Common word: ""TIMES"": 
   T, I, M, E, S -> distinct, has E in position 4? 
   But E was in position 5 in the first guess and now we are putting it in position 4? That might be good to test.

 However, we know E cannot be in position 5? Actually, the feedback said E was present but not in position 5, so position 5 is ruled out for E. But positions 1-4 are still possible.

 How about ""HOUSE""? 
   H, O, U, S, E -> distinct, E at end? But E cannot be at position 5? Actually, we cannot put E at position 5 because we already know it's not there. So HOUSE would have E in the last position again -> which we know is wrong -> it will give a ""-"" but we already know that. 

   So we should avoid putting E in the fifth position to avoid wasting a letter slot.

 Therefore, we should place E in one of the positions: 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let's try E in position 4? 
   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S T O L E: E is in position 5 -> same problem.

 We need to put E in positions 1,2, or 3? 

 Word: ""STEAM"" -> E in position 3? STEAM: 
   S, T, E, A, M -> but A is already ruled out! Because we got A(x) in first guess. 

 So we cannot use A.

 How about ""STEPS"": 
   S, T, E, P, S -> repeated S? And S at positions 1 and 5? That's two letters? So let's avoid repeats.

 Another: ""DEPOT"": 
   D, E, P, O, T -> distinct letters, E in position 2? This seems good.
   Letters: D, E, P, O, T -> none are C,R,A,N.

 But we haven't tested D, P, O, T yet. 

 Another good word: ""DOZEN"": 
   D, O, Z, E, N -> however, N is ruled out, so we can't use N.

 We must avoid N.

 How about ""PLEAD"": 
   P, L, E, A, D -> but A is ruled out.

 So let's avoid A.

 Another: ""MODEL"": 
   M, O, D, E, L -> distinct? M, O, D, E, L -> yes. And E is in position 4? 
   Positions: M (1), O (2), D (3), E (4), L (5). 
   Since E is in position 4 and we know it's not in 5, but position 4 might be a new position.

 However, note: the secret word has E in another position, but we don't know if position 4 is the correct one? So it's okay to test.

 But let me see if there's a better word: 
   ""MEDIC"" -> contains C, ruled out.

 Another: ""FIELD"": 
   F, I, E, L, D -> distinct, E in position 3?

 But let me think: we want to cover more vowels or common letters. 

 We haven't tried L, O, T? 

 Considering ""DOZEN"" is invalid (has N). How about ""WOVEN""? again has N.

 Another common word: ""OILED"": 
   O, I, L, E, D -> distinct, E in position 4? 
   Or ""TOWEL"": has E at position 4? 

 But note: ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> distinct, and E in position 4.

 How about ""POISE"": 
   P, O, I, S, E -> distinct? Yes. But E is at the end - position 5 -> not allowed.

 So words ending with E are no good for our purpose? Because we'll get an immediate ""minus"" but we already know E isn't in last.

 But if we put E in position 5 again, then we are wasting the last letter slot? So let's avoid.

 After avoiding position 5 for E, I can use words that have E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Now, let's find a word with E in position 1? 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" ... -> ""EPOXY"": E, P, O, X, Y -> distinct? Yes. And X and Y are less common? 
     ""ELITE"": repeated E -> less distinct letters.

 Another: ""ETHIC"": has C -> invalid.

 ""EDGES"": repeated E? And S at end? 
   But E at position 1 and then at the end? Avoid repeated? 

 How about ""ENSUE""? repeated E? 

 I think ""MODEL"" is a decent choice: positions 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L -> so E in position 4.

 Or ""DIET"": too short, need 5 letters.

 Let me go with ""MODEL"": 
   M, O, D, E, L -> all new distinct letters, E in position 4.

 But note: if E is in the secret word and is not in position 5, but we put it in position 4, we'll get:
   - If it is in position 4: then we get a ""✓""
   - If it is in position 1,2, or 3: then we get ""-"" for position 4.

 So we will get more information.

 Alternatively, we might try to put E in a completely different position? For example, first guess E was in position 5, so let's try position 1? 

 Another candidate: ""ELOPE"": E in position 1? But has repeated E? 

 ""ESCORT"" has C -> invalid.

 ""EXIST"": E in position 1? X, I, S, T -> distinct? Yes. 
   Letters: E, X, I, S, T -> avoid S? Why? We haven't tested S yet. 

 I think ""EXIST"" is a possible word.

 But note: we can use words even with less common letters? 

 Considering commonality: 
   Common letters: S, T, I, O, L, etc. 

 ""EXIST"" has E, X, I, S, T -> X is very infrequent.

 How about ""LOUIE"": has repeated I? Not distinct.

 Another: ""QUIET"": Q and E - Q is less common? 

 After review, I think ""MODEL"" is acceptable.

 But another idea: we might try ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> distinct? Yes. E in position 4? 
   Or ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E in position 5 -> not allowed.

 ""SPIEL"": E in position 4.

 ""SLIDE"": 
   S, L, I, D, E -> E in position 5? No.

 ""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E -> contains C and repeated E -> invalid.

 I'll go with ""MODEL"": 
   We test M, O, D, E, L -> E in position 4.

 Or ""POISE"" but ends with E -> avoid.

 Alternative: ""TIMER"": 
   T, I, M, E, R -> distinct? Yes. E in position 4? 
   But R was already ruled out by first guess! Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position 2 and got ""x"", so R is not in the word.

 So we cannot use R.

 So in my next guess I must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Therefore, ""TIMER"" is invalid because of R.

 Similarly, we must ensure we avoid C, R, A, N.

 Now, back to ""MODEL"": 
   Contains M, O, D, E, L -> safe.

 We can also consider ""BIKED"": but has K? 
   ""BIKED"": B, I, K, E, D -> distinct, E in position 4? 

 But note: we haven't tested B, I, K, D either.

 However, ""MODEL"" seems more common.

 Another common word: ""GOURD"": but missing E? 

 We must include E? Yes, because we need to figure out where E is.

 We are required to guess a valid English word. 

 After thinking, I'll choose ""MODEL"".

 Let me confirm if ""MODEL"" is a valid word: yes.

 So guess: MODEL<thought>
Previous feedback for ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-).  
This means:  
- Letters C, R, A, N are ABSENT from the secret word.  
- Letter E is PRESENT but not in the 5th position (since it was guessed there and got ""-"").  
- The secret word contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.  

For the next guess:  
- Must include E in a position other than 5 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4) to test its location.  
- Must avoid using C, R, A, N entirely.  
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, D, I, M) to maximize information.  

Considering words with E in position 4 to test a new spot while including other common letters:  
- ""MODEL"": Places E in position 4 (new position to test), uses distinct unused letters (M, O, D, E, L), all valid.  
- Alternatives like ""TIMES"" (E in pos 4) invalid due to R; ""POISE"" (E in pos 5) invalid as E can't be in pos 5; ""STEAM"" invalid due to A.  
""MODEL"" efficiently tests E in position 4 and introduces M, O, D, L.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,EXIST,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since this is the beginning, we have no prior feedback.
 A good starting word is one that has common letters and maximizes the information gain. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""CRATE"" are often recommended by Wordle enthusiasts because they include common vowels and consonants.

 I am going to choose ""SLATE"" because:
 - It includes two common vowels: 'A' and 'E'
 - It includes three common consonants: 'S', 'L', 'T'
 - These letters are frequently found in 5-letter English words.

 Therefore, my first guess is ""SLATE"".

 We'll output it in the required format.<thought>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. 

The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- It contains three common vowels: 'A' and 'E' (with 'A' being the most frequently occurring vowel).
- It includes three common consonants: 'C', 'R', and 'N' (all ranked within the top 15 most frequent letters in English).
- The letters are distinct, which helps test five unique positions.

This choice efficiently narrows down potential secret words based on the feedback we receive.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since it was guessed in the last position and got a minus, meaning it's elsewhere).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are definitely not in the word.

 Since E is present but not in the last position, we should guess a word that includes E in one of the first four positions, and avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Also, we should aim to include other common letters to maximize information. Common letters not yet tested include: S, T, O, U, L, D, H, I, etc.

 Let's think of words that have E in positions 1-4 and contain other common untested letters.

 Possible positions for E: it can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know from the absence of C, R, A, N that the secret word cannot contain any of these.

 Since E is the only known letter so far, we need a word that uses E and adds new common letters.

 Example: 
   Trying a word with E in the second position? Like ""SLEPT"", but note we haven't tested S, L, P, T.

 However, let's check our constraints: 
 Cannot use: C, R, A, N.

 We can use: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we know E is in the word (somewhere except the last), let's prioritize words that place E in a different position than last.

 Let me list some candidate words:
   Positions for E: We want to try E in positions 1,2,3,4 to gain positional information.

 For instance:
   E in position 1 examples: 
     ""E"" _ _ _ _ -> e.g., ""EJECT"" has repeated E and uses J and T? But repeated E might not be ideal? Also, we don't know if there are multiple E's. However, let's avoid repeats for maximum information? But the word might have repeated letters.

 However, we can assume for now that the word might not have repeats? Actually, Wordle words can have repeated letters.

 But for efficiency, we might avoid repeats unless necessary.

 Let me think: 
   We know E is present. But we don't know if there's more than one E. So we should not rule that out.

 However, since we only have 6 tries, we should aim for words with 5 distinct letters to test more.

 Therefore, let's choose a word with E and four new distinct letters, all not C,R,A,N.

 Candidate: 
   Example: ""STEEL"" has repeated E -> not distinct. So skip.
   Another: ""OUCHY"" doesn't have E -> invalid.

 We must include E.

 Another: ""SLEEK"" has repeated E -> less informative.

 So I'll aim for words where E is included and the rest are distinct and new.

 Common word: ""TIMES"": 
   T, I, M, E, S -> distinct, has E in position 4? 
   But E was in position 5 in the first guess and now we are putting it in position 4? That might be good to test.

 However, we know E cannot be in position 5? Actually, the feedback said E was present but not in position 5, so position 5 is ruled out for E. But positions 1-4 are still possible.

 How about ""HOUSE""? 
   H, O, U, S, E -> distinct, E at end? But E cannot be at position 5? Actually, we cannot put E at position 5 because we already know it's not there. So HOUSE would have E in the last position again -> which we know is wrong -> it will give a ""-"" but we already know that. 

   So we should avoid putting E in the fifth position to avoid wasting a letter slot.

 Therefore, we should place E in one of the positions: 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let's try E in position 4? 
   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S T O L E: E is in position 5 -> same problem.

 We need to put E in positions 1,2, or 3? 

 Word: ""STEAM"" -> E in position 3? STEAM: 
   S, T, E, A, M -> but A is already ruled out! Because we got A(x) in first guess. 

 So we cannot use A.

 How about ""STEPS"": 
   S, T, E, P, S -> repeated S? And S at positions 1 and 5? That's two letters? So let's avoid repeats.

 Another: ""DEPOT"": 
   D, E, P, O, T -> distinct letters, E in position 2? This seems good.
   Letters: D, E, P, O, T -> none are C,R,A,N.

 But we haven't tested D, P, O, T yet. 

 Another good word: ""DOZEN"": 
   D, O, Z, E, N -> however, N is ruled out, so we can't use N.

 We must avoid N.

 How about ""PLEAD"": 
   P, L, E, A, D -> but A is ruled out.

 So let's avoid A.

 Another: ""MODEL"": 
   M, O, D, E, L -> distinct? M, O, D, E, L -> yes. And E is in position 4? 
   Positions: M (1), O (2), D (3), E (4), L (5). 
   Since E is in position 4 and we know it's not in 5, but position 4 might be a new position.

 However, note: the secret word has E in another position, but we don't know if position 4 is the correct one? So it's okay to test.

 But let me see if there's a better word: 
   ""MEDIC"" -> contains C, ruled out.

 Another: ""FIELD"": 
   F, I, E, L, D -> distinct, E in position 3?

 But let me think: we want to cover more vowels or common letters. 

 We haven't tried L, O, T? 

 Considering ""DOZEN"" is invalid (has N). How about ""WOVEN""? again has N.

 Another common word: ""OILED"": 
   O, I, L, E, D -> distinct, E in position 4? 
   Or ""TOWEL"": has E at position 4? 

 But note: ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> distinct, and E in position 4.

 How about ""POISE"": 
   P, O, I, S, E -> distinct? Yes. But E is at the end - position 5 -> not allowed.

 So words ending with E are no good for our purpose? Because we'll get an immediate ""minus"" but we already know E isn't in last.

 But if we put E in position 5 again, then we are wasting the last letter slot? So let's avoid.

 After avoiding position 5 for E, I can use words that have E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Now, let's find a word with E in position 1? 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" ... -> ""EPOXY"": E, P, O, X, Y -> distinct? Yes. And X and Y are less common? 
     ""ELITE"": repeated E -> less distinct letters.

 Another: ""ETHIC"": has C -> invalid.

 ""EDGES"": repeated E? And S at end? 
   But E at position 1 and then at the end? Avoid repeated? 

 How about ""ENSUE""? repeated E? 

 I think ""MODEL"" is a decent choice: positions 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L -> so E in position 4.

 Or ""DIET"": too short, need 5 letters.

 Let me go with ""MODEL"": 
   M, O, D, E, L -> all new distinct letters, E in position 4.

 But note: if E is in the secret word and is not in position 5, but we put it in position 4, we'll get:
   - If it is in position 4: then we get a ""✓""
   - If it is in position 1,2, or 3: then we get ""-"" for position 4.

 So we will get more information.

 Alternatively, we might try to put E in a completely different position? For example, first guess E was in position 5, so let's try position 1? 

 Another candidate: ""ELOPE"": E in position 1? But has repeated E? 

 ""ESCORT"" has C -> invalid.

 ""EXIST"": E in position 1? X, I, S, T -> distinct? Yes. 
   Letters: E, X, I, S, T -> avoid S? Why? We haven't tested S yet. 

 I think ""EXIST"" is a possible word.

 But note: we can use words even with less common letters? 

 Considering commonality: 
   Common letters: S, T, I, O, L, etc. 

 ""EXIST"" has E, X, I, S, T -> X is very infrequent.

 How about ""LOUIE"": has repeated I? Not distinct.

 Another: ""QUIET"": Q and E - Q is less common? 

 After review, I think ""MODEL"" is acceptable.

 But another idea: we might try ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> distinct? Yes. E in position 4? 
   Or ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E in position 5 -> not allowed.

 ""SPIEL"": E in position 4.

 ""SLIDE"": 
   S, L, I, D, E -> E in position 5? No.

 ""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E -> contains C and repeated E -> invalid.

 I'll go with ""MODEL"": 
   We test M, O, D, E, L -> E in position 4.

 Or ""POISE"" but ends with E -> avoid.

 Alternative: ""TIMER"": 
   T, I, M, E, R -> distinct? Yes. E in position 4? 
   But R was already ruled out by first guess! Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position 2 and got ""x"", so R is not in the word.

 So we cannot use R.

 So in my next guess I must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Therefore, ""TIMER"" is invalid because of R.

 Similarly, we must ensure we avoid C, R, A, N.

 Now, back to ""MODEL"": 
   Contains M, O, D, E, L -> safe.

 We can also consider ""BIKED"": but has K? 
   ""BIKED"": B, I, K, E, D -> distinct, E in position 4? 

 But note: we haven't tested B, I, K, D either.

 However, ""MODEL"" seems more common.

 Another common word: ""GOURD"": but missing E? 

 We must include E? Yes, because we need to figure out where E is.

 We are required to guess a valid English word. 

 After thinking, I'll choose ""MODEL"".

 Let me confirm if ""MODEL"" is a valid word: yes.

 So guess: MODEL<thought>

Avoid repeated? \n\n How about ""ENSUE""? repeated E? \n\n I think ""MODEL"" is a decent choice: positions 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L -> so E in position 4.\n\n Or ""DIET"": too short, need 5 letters.\n\n Let me go with ""MODEL"": \n   M, O, D, E, L -> all new distinct letters, E in position 4.\n\n But note: if E is in the secret word and is not in position 5, but we put it in position 4, we\'ll get:\n   - If it is in position 4: then we get a ""✓""\n   - If it is in position 1,2, or 3: then we get ""-"" for position 4.\n\n So we will get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we might try to put E in a completely different position? For example, first guess E was in position 5, so let\'s try position 1? \n\n Another candidate: ""ELOPE"": E in position 1? But has repeated E? \n\n ""ESCORT"" has C -> invalid.\n\n ""EXIST"": E in position 1? X, I, S, T -> distinct? Yes. \n   Letters: E, X, I, S, T -> avoid S? Why? We haven\'t tested S yet. \n\n I think ""EXIST"" is a possible word.\n\n But note: we can use words even with less common letters? \n\n Considering commonality: \n   Common letters: S, T, I, O, L, etc. \n\n ""EXIST"" has E, X, I, S, T -> X is very infrequent.\n\n How about ""LOUIE"": has repeated I? Not distinct.\n\n Another: ""QUIET"": Q and E - Q is less common? \n\n After review, I think ""MODEL"" is acceptable.\n\n But another idea: we might try ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> distinct? Yes. E in position 4? \n   Or ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E in position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n ""SPIEL"": E in position 4.\n\n ""SLIDE"": \n   S, L, I, D, E -> E in position 5? No.\n\n ""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E -> contains C and repeated E -> invalid.\n\n I\'ll go with ""MODEL"": \n   We test M, O, D, E, L -> E in position 4.\n\n Or ""POISE"" but ends with E -> avoid.\n\n Alternative: ""TIMER"": \n   T, I, M, E, R -> distinct? Yes. E in position 4? \n   But R was already ruled out by first guess! Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position 2 and got ""x"", so R is not in the word.\n\n So we cannot use R.\n\n So in my next guess I must avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Therefore, ""TIMER"" is invalid because of R.\n\n Similarly, we must ensure we avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Now, back to ""MODEL"": \n   Contains M, O, D, E, L -> safe.\n\n We can also consider ""BIKED"": but has K? \n   ""BIKED"": B, I, K, E, D -> distinct, E in position 4? \n\n But note: we haven\'t tested B, I, K, D either.\n\n However, ""MODEL"" seems more common.\n\n Another common word: ""GOURD"": but missing E? \n\n We must include E? Yes, because we need to figure out where E is.\n\n We are required to guess a valid English word. \n\n After thinking, I\'ll choose ""MODEL"".\n\n Let me confirm if ""MODEL"" is a valid word: yes.\n\n So guess: MODEL<thought>\nPrevious feedback for ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-).  \nThis means:  \n- Letters C, R, A, N are ABSENT from the secret word.  \n- Letter E is PRESENT but not in the 5th position (since it was guessed there and got ""-"").  \n- The secret word contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must include E in a position other than 5 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4) to test its location.  \n- Must avoid using C, R, A, N entirely.  \n- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, D, I, M) to maximize information.  \n\nConsidering words with E in position 4 to test a new spot while including other common letters:  \n- ""MODEL"": Places E in position 4 (new position to test), uses distinct unused letters (M, O, D, E, L), all valid.  \n- Alternatives like ""TIMES"" (E in pos 4) invalid due to R; ""POISE"" (E in pos 5) invalid as E can\'t be in pos 5; ""STEAM"" invalid due to A.  \n""MODEL"" efficiently tests E in position 4 and introduces M, O, D, L.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>model</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: model -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) D(x) E(-) L(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are absent (not in the word at all)
- E is present but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 and got ""-"")

Guess 2: ""model"" -> M(x), O(x), D(x), E(-), L(x)
Meaning:
- M, O, D, L are absent (not in the word at all)
- E is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 and got ""-"")

Combining the feedback:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L
- Present letter: E (but not in position 4 or 5)

Since E is present and not in position 4 or 5, it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We have used 8 letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L.

We need to guess a word that:
- Includes E in position 1, 2, or 3 (to find its correct position)
- Does not use any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L
- Uses new common letters to maximize information

Available common letters: We have not tested: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: E is the only known present letter so far.

We should try to place E in a new position: either 1, 2, or 3. Since we tried position 4 and 5, we have positions 1,2,3 left.

We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters left: S, T, P, U, I, B, F, G, H, etc.

Let's think of words that have E in position 1, 2, or 3 and use common letters.

Option 1: E in position 1
  Examples: 
    ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
    Words: ""EPOXY"" (but O is absent, so invalid), ""ETHIC"" (H and C, but C is absent) -> invalid.
    ""EJECT"" (E, J, E, C, T) -> repeated E and C absent -> invalid.
    ""EIGHT"" (E, I, G, H, T) -> all new letters? 
        Letters: E, I, G, H, T -> distinct, and I, G, H, T are new.

Option 2: E in position 2
  Examples:
    _ ""E"" _ _ _
    ""PENIS"" (P, E, N, I, S) -> but N is absent -> invalid.
    ""BESET"" (B, E, S, E, T) -> repeated E -> less informative? But we don't know if there are two E's? 
        However, we have only one E confirmed so far, but there could be two. But to maximize information, distinct letters are better.
    ""FETUS"" (F, E, T, U, S) -> distinct, new letters.

Option 3: E in position 3
  Examples:
    _ _ ""E"" _ _
    ""SPEED"" (S, P, E, E, D) -> repeated E and D is absent -> invalid.
    ""TWEET"" (T, W, E, E, T) -> repeated and T at both ends? 
    ""QUEEN"" (Q, U, E, E, N) -> repeated and N absent -> invalid.
    ""PIECE"" (P, I, E, C, E) -> repeated and C absent -> invalid.

After reviewing, let's consider:

For E in position 1: ""EIGHT"" seems valid: E, I, G, H, T -> all new and distinct.

For E in position 2: ""FETUS"": F, E, T, U, S -> distinct and new.

For E in position 3: It's harder to find a word without the absent letters. 
  ""SWEPT"" (S, W, E, P, T) -> but P and T are new? 
  However, note: we have not tested S, W, E, P, T -> all are available.

But ""SWEPT"" has E in position 3.

We can also consider ""SWEET"" but repeated E -> less informative.

Now, which one to choose? We want to cover more common letters.

Common letters: S, T, I, P, U, etc.

""EIGHT"" uses I, G, H, T -> G and H are less common? 
""FETUS"" uses F, T, U, S -> F and U are medium, S and T are very common.
""SWEPT"" uses S, W, E, P, T -> W is less common, but S, P, T are common.

We might also consider ""PIETY"": P, I, E, T, Y -> E in position 3? 
  But Y is at the end? 
  Letters: P, I, E, T, Y -> distinct, and we haven't tested P, I, T, Y.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,N,M,O,D,L.

""PIETY"" is valid? Yes, meaning piety.

Similarly, ""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T -> E in position 4? But we know E is not in position 4 (from guess 2: E in position 4 got ""-""). So we cannot put E in position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid position 4 and 5 for E.

Therefore, for E in position 3: ""PIETY"" has E in position 3? 
  P-I-E-T-Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:T, 5:Y -> so E is in position 3.

Similarly, ""SWEPT"": S-W-E-P-T -> E in position 3.

Now, comparing:

- ""EIGHT"": E in pos1, tests I,G,H,T
- ""FETUS"": E in pos2, tests F,T,U,S
- ""PIETY"": E in pos3, tests P,I,T,Y
- ""SWEPT"": E in pos3, tests S,W,E,P,T

We want to test the most common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A, O, N are absent. So T, I, S are very common.

""FETUS"" has S and T, and also U and F.
""PIETY"" has P, I, T, Y.
""SWEPT"" has S, W, P, T.

""FETUS"" and ""SWEPT"" both have S and T.

But note: we have two positions to test for E: 1,2,3. We haven't tested position 1 and 2 yet? We tested 4 and 5, so 1,2,3 are open.

We might want to test a position we haven't tried: position 1 or 2.

So ""EIGHT"" tests position 1, ""FETUS"" tests position 2, and ""PIETY"" or ""SWEPT"" test position 3.

Since we have no information about position 1 and 2, it might be better to test one of them.

I think ""FETUS"" is a good candidate because it tests E in position 2 and includes S and T, which are common.

But let's see if there's a word that tests E in position 1 and includes S and T? 

For example: ""ETUIS"" is not common? 
  ""ETHOS"" -> but H and O, O is absent -> invalid.
  ""ESTUS"" -> not a word? 
  ""EXIST"": E, X, I, S, T -> E in position 1, and X is a bit rare, but it's valid. 
  ""EXIST"" uses E, X, I, S, T -> distinct, and we test E in position 1, and I, S, T.

But X is less common, so ""FETUS"" might be better because it uses more common letters? 

However, ""FETUS"" has F and U, which are less common than S and T? But S and T are in ""FETUS"".

""FETUS"": F, E, T, U, S -> letters: F, T, U, S, and E.

""EXIST"": E, X, I, S, T -> E, X, I, S, T.

I think ""EXIST"" is acceptable, but let's see if we can find a word with E in position 1 and without rare letters.

Another: ""EDITS"": E, D, I, T, S -> but D is absent (from guess 2: D(x)) -> invalid.

""ESTOP"": E, S, T, O, P -> O is absent -> invalid.

""SPEED"" -> repeated E and D absent.

So ""EXIST"" might be one of the few options for E in position 1.

But we can also consider E in position 2 with more common letters: 

""BEST"": too short.
""JEST"": J is less common? 
""TESTY"": T, E, S, T, Y -> repeated T -> less informative.
""PEST"": too short.

""FETUS"" seems reasonable.

Alternatively, ""SUITE"": S, U, I, T, E -> but E is in position 5 -> we know E is not in position 5, so we should avoid. 

""SUITE"" would have E at the end -> not allowed.

So I think ""FETUS"" is a good choice.

But let's check the word: ""FETUS"" is a valid Wordle word.

We'll get feedback on E in position 2 and the letters F, T, U, S.

If E is in position 2, we get a ""✓"" for E? Or if not, we get a ""-"" and know it's in 1 or 3.

So I'll go with ""FETUS"".

But note: we have to output in the required format.

Another candidate: ""PIETY"" for E in position 3? But we haven't tested position 1 or 2 for E, so it might be better to test position 1 or 2 first.

We have limited guesses, so we need to maximize information.

I think testing E in position 2 is a good middle ground.

So guess: FETUS

But let me confirm the letters: F, E, T, U, S -> all not in the absent list.

Yes.

So the next guess is ""FETUS"".
</think>
<thought>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Letters C, R, A, N are ABSENT (x). E is PRESENT but not in position 5 (-).
- **Guess 2 (""model"")**: Letters M, O, D, L are ABSENT (x). E is PRESENT but not in position 4 (-).

**Key insights**:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but it cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (since both placements resulted in ""-""). Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Absent letters (cannot be used): C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L (8 letters eliminated).
- Present letters: Only E is confirmed so far (position unknown in 1–3).
- Goal: Test E in a new position (1, 2, or 3) while introducing common unused letters to maximize information.

**Strategy for next guess**:
- Place E in position 2 (untested position) to narrow its location.
- Use distinct, common unused letters: Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, P) and vowels (e.g., I, U) not yet tested.
- Avoid absent letters strictly.
- **Chosen word: ""FETUS""**  
  - F (new), E (position 2), T (new), U (new), S (new).  
  - Tests E in position 2 and introduces 4 new common letters (S, T, F, U).  
  - If E is in position 2, it gets ""✓""; if not, we rule out position 2 and learn E is in 1 or 3.  
  - S and T are highly frequent, increasing chances of hits.  

Alternatives like ""EXIST"" (E in pos 1) or ""PIETY"" (E in pos 3) were considered, but ""FETUS"" balances common letters and positional testing best.

    ""BESET"" (B, E, S, E, T) -> repeated E -> less informative? But we don't know if there are two E's? 
        However, we have only one E confirmed so far, but there could be two. But to maximize information, distinct letters are better.

    ""TWEET"" (T, W, E, E, T) -> repeated and T at both ends? 
    ""QUEEN"" (Q, U, E, E, N) -> repeated and N absent -> invalid.
    ""PIECE"" (P, I, E, C, E) -> repeated and C absent -> invalid.

After reviewing, let's consider:

For E in position 1: ""EIGHT"" seems valid: E, I, G, H, T -> all new and distinct.

For E in position 2: ""FETUS"": F, E, T, U, S -> distinct and new.

For E in position 3: It's harder to find a word without the absent letters. 
  ""SWEPT"" (S, W, E, P, T) -> but P and T are new? 
  However, note: we have not tested S, W, E, P, T -> all are available.

But ""SWEPT"" has E in position 3.

We can also consider ""SWEET"" but repeated E -> less informative.

Now, which one to choose? We want to cover more common letters.

Common letters: S, T, I, P, U, etc.

""EIGHT"" uses I, G, H, T -> G and H are less common? 
""FETUS"" uses F, T, U, S -> F and U are medium, S and T are very common.

We might also consider ""PIETY"": P, I, E, T, Y -> E in position 3? 
  But Y is at the end? 
  Letters: P, I, E, T, Y -> distinct, and we haven't tested P, I, T, Y.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,N,M,O,D,L.

""PIETY"" is valid? Yes, meaning piety.

Similarly, ""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T -> E in position 4? But we know E is not in position 4 (from guess 2: E in position 4 got ""-""). So we cannot put E in position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid position 4 and 5 for E.

Therefore, for E in position 3: ""PIETY"" has E in position 3? 
  P-I-E-T-Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:T, 5:Y -> so E is in position 3.

Similarly, ""SWEPT"": S-W-E-P-T -> E in position 3.

Now, comparing:

- ""EIGHT"": E in pos1, tests I,G,H,T
- ""FETUS"": E in pos2, tests F,T,U,S
- ""PIETY"": E in pos3, tests P,I,T,Y
- ""SWEPT"": E in pos3, tests S,W,E,P,T

We want to test the most common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A, O, N are absent. So T, I, S are very common.

""FETUS"" has S and T, and also U and F.
""PIETY"" has P, I, T, Y.
""SWEPT"" has S, W, P, T.

""FETUS"" and ""SWEPT"" both have S and T.

But note: we have two positions to test for E: 1,2,3. We haven't tested position 1 and 2 yet? We tested 4 and 5, so 1,2,3 are open.

We might want to test a position we haven't tried: position 1 or 2.

So ""EIGHT"" tests position 1, ""FETUS"" tests position 2, and ""PIETY"" or ""SWEPT"" test position 3.

Since we have no information about position 1 and 2, it might be better to test one of them.

I think ""FETUS"" is a good candidate because it tests E in position 2 and includes S and T, which are common.

But let's see if there's a word that tests E in position 1 and includes S and T? 

For example: ""ETUIS"" is not common? 
  ""ETHOS"" -> but H and O, O is absent -> invalid.
  ""ESTUS"" -> not a word? 
  ""EXIST"": E, X, I, S, T -> E in position 1, and X is a bit rare, but it's valid. 
  ""EXIST"" uses E, X, I, S, T -> distinct, and we test E in position 1, and I, S, T.

But X is less common, so ""FETUS"" might be better because it uses more common letters? 

However, ""FETUS"" has F and U, which are less common than S and T? But S and T are in ""FETUS"".

""FETUS"": F, E, T, U, S -> letters: F, T, U, S, and E.

""EXIST"": E, X, I, S, T -> E, X, I, S, T.

I think ""EXIST"" is acceptable, but let's see if we can find a word with E in position 1 and without rare letters.

Another: ""EDITS"": E, D, I, T, S -> but D is absent (from guess 2: D(x)) -> invalid.

""ESTOP"": E, S, T, O, P -> O is absent -> invalid.

""SPEED"" -> repeated E and D absent.

So ""EXIST"" might be one of the few options for E in position 1.

But we can also consider E in position 2 with more common letters: 

""BEST"": too short.
""JEST"": J is less common? 
""TESTY"": T, E, S, T, Y -> repeated T -> less informative.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since this is the beginning, we have no prior feedback.
 A good starting word is one that has common letters and maximizes the information gain. Words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", or ""CRATE"" are often recommended by Wordle enthusiasts because they include common vowels and consonants.

 I am going to choose ""SLATE"" because:
 - It includes two common vowels: 'A' and 'E'
 - It includes three common consonants: 'S', 'L', 'T'
 - These letters are frequently found in 5-letter English words.

 Therefore, my first guess is ""SLATE"".

 We'll output it in the required format.<thought>
For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that maximizes information gain. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants to cover a broad range of possibilities. 

The word ""CRANE"" is ideal because:
- It contains three common vowels: 'A' and 'E' (with 'A' being the most frequently occurring vowel).
- It includes three common consonants: 'C', 'R', and 'N' (all ranked within the top 15 most frequent letters in English).
- The letters are distinct, which helps test five unique positions.

This choice efficiently narrows down potential secret words based on the feedback we receive.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letter E is in the secret word, but not in the last position (since it was guessed in the last position and got a minus, meaning it's elsewhere).
 - The letters C, R, A, N are definitely not in the word.

 Since E is present but not in the last position, we should guess a word that includes E in one of the first four positions, and avoid using C, R, A, N.

 Also, we should aim to include other common letters to maximize information. Common letters not yet tested include: S, T, O, U, L, D, H, I, etc.

 Let's think of words that have E in positions 1-4 and contain other common untested letters.

 Possible positions for E: it can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We also know from the absence of C, R, A, N that the secret word cannot contain any of these.

 Since E is the only known letter so far, we need a word that uses E and adds new common letters.

 Example: 
   Trying a word with E in the second position? Like ""SLEPT"", but note we haven't tested S, L, P, T.

 However, let's check our constraints: 
 Cannot use: C, R, A, N.

 We can use: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Since we know E is in the word (somewhere except the last), let's prioritize words that place E in a different position than last.

 Let me list some candidate words:
   Positions for E: We want to try E in positions 1,2,3,4 to gain positional information.

 For instance:
   E in position 1 examples: 
     ""E"" _ _ _ _ -> e.g., ""EJECT"" has repeated E and uses J and T? But repeated E might not be ideal? Also, we don't know if there are multiple E's. However, let's avoid repeats for maximum information? But the word might have repeated letters.

 However, we can assume for now that the word might not have repeats? Actually, Wordle words can have repeated letters.

 But for efficiency, we might avoid repeats unless necessary.

 Let me think: 
   We know E is present. But we don't know if there's more than one E. So we should not rule that out.

 However, since we only have 6 tries, we should aim for words with 5 distinct letters to test more.

 Therefore, let's choose a word with E and four new distinct letters, all not C,R,A,N.

 Candidate: 
   Example: ""STEEL"" has repeated E -> not distinct. So skip.
   Another: ""OUCHY"" doesn't have E -> invalid.

 We must include E.

 Another: ""SLEEK"" has repeated E -> less informative.

 So I'll aim for words where E is included and the rest are distinct and new.

 Common word: ""TIMES"": 
   T, I, M, E, S -> distinct, has E in position 4? 
   But E was in position 5 in the first guess and now we are putting it in position 4? That might be good to test.

 However, we know E cannot be in position 5? Actually, the feedback said E was present but not in position 5, so position 5 is ruled out for E. But positions 1-4 are still possible.

 How about ""HOUSE""? 
   H, O, U, S, E -> distinct, E at end? But E cannot be at position 5? Actually, we cannot put E at position 5 because we already know it's not there. So HOUSE would have E in the last position again -> which we know is wrong -> it will give a ""-"" but we already know that. 

   So we should avoid putting E in the fifth position to avoid wasting a letter slot.

 Therefore, we should place E in one of the positions: 1,2,3, or 4.

 Let's try E in position 4? 
   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S T O L E: E is in position 5 -> same problem.

 We need to put E in positions 1,2, or 3? 

 Word: ""STEAM"" -> E in position 3? STEAM: 
   S, T, E, A, M -> but A is already ruled out! Because we got A(x) in first guess. 

 So we cannot use A.

 How about ""STEPS"": 
   S, T, E, P, S -> repeated S? And S at positions 1 and 5? That's two letters? So let's avoid repeats.

 Another: ""DEPOT"": 
   D, E, P, O, T -> distinct letters, E in position 2? This seems good.
   Letters: D, E, P, O, T -> none are C,R,A,N.

 But we haven't tested D, P, O, T yet. 

 Another good word: ""DOZEN"": 
   D, O, Z, E, N -> however, N is ruled out, so we can't use N.

 We must avoid N.

 How about ""PLEAD"": 
   P, L, E, A, D -> but A is ruled out.

 So let's avoid A.

 Another: ""MODEL"": 
   M, O, D, E, L -> distinct? M, O, D, E, L -> yes. And E is in position 4? 
   Positions: M (1), O (2), D (3), E (4), L (5). 
   Since E is in position 4 and we know it's not in 5, but position 4 might be a new position.

 However, note: the secret word has E in another position, but we don't know if position 4 is the correct one? So it's okay to test.

 But let me see if there's a better word: 
   ""MEDIC"" -> contains C, ruled out.

 Another: ""FIELD"": 
   F, I, E, L, D -> distinct, E in position 3?

 But let me think: we want to cover more vowels or common letters. 

 We haven't tried L, O, T? 

 Considering ""DOZEN"" is invalid (has N). How about ""WOVEN""? again has N.

 Another common word: ""OILED"": 
   O, I, L, E, D -> distinct, E in position 4? 
   Or ""TOWEL"": has E at position 4? 

 But note: ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> distinct, and E in position 4.

 How about ""POISE"": 
   P, O, I, S, E -> distinct? Yes. But E is at the end - position 5 -> not allowed.

 So words ending with E are no good for our purpose? Because we'll get an immediate ""minus"" but we already know E isn't in last.

 But if we put E in position 5 again, then we are wasting the last letter slot? So let's avoid.

 After avoiding position 5 for E, I can use words that have E in positions 1,2,3,4.

 Now, let's find a word with E in position 1? 
   Examples: 
     ""E"" ... -> ""EPOXY"": E, P, O, X, Y -> distinct? Yes. And X and Y are less common? 
     ""ELITE"": repeated E -> less distinct letters.

 Another: ""ETHIC"": has C -> invalid.

 ""EDGES"": repeated E? And S at end? 
   But E at position 1 and then at the end? Avoid repeated? 

 How about ""ENSUE""? repeated E? 

 I think ""MODEL"" is a decent choice: positions 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L -> so E in position 4.

 Or ""DIET"": too short, need 5 letters.

 Let me go with ""MODEL"": 
   M, O, D, E, L -> all new distinct letters, E in position 4.

 But note: if E is in the secret word and is not in position 5, but we put it in position 4, we'll get:
   - If it is in position 4: then we get a ""✓""
   - If it is in position 1,2, or 3: then we get ""-"" for position 4.

 So we will get more information.

 Alternatively, we might try to put E in a completely different position? For example, first guess E was in position 5, so let's try position 1? 

 Another candidate: ""ELOPE"": E in position 1? But has repeated E? 

 ""ESCORT"" has C -> invalid.

 ""EXIST"": E in position 1? X, I, S, T -> distinct? Yes. 
   Letters: E, X, I, S, T -> avoid S? Why? We haven't tested S yet. 

 I think ""EXIST"" is a possible word.

 But note: we can use words even with less common letters? 

 Considering commonality: 
   Common letters: S, T, I, O, L, etc. 

 ""EXIST"" has E, X, I, S, T -> X is very infrequent.

 How about ""LOUIE"": has repeated I? Not distinct.

 Another: ""QUIET"": Q and E - Q is less common? 

 After review, I think ""MODEL"" is acceptable.

 But another idea: we might try ""SPIEL"": 
   S, P, I, E, L -> distinct? Yes. E in position 4? 
   Or ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E in position 5 -> not allowed.

 ""SPIEL"": E in position 4.

 ""SLIDE"": 
   S, L, I, D, E -> E in position 5? No.

 ""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E -> contains C and repeated E -> invalid.

 I'll go with ""MODEL"": 
   We test M, O, D, E, L -> E in position 4.

 Or ""POISE"" but ends with E -> avoid.

 Alternative: ""TIMER"": 
   T, I, M, E, R -> distinct? Yes. E in position 4? 
   But R was already ruled out by first guess! Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position 2 and got ""x"", so R is not in the word.

 So we cannot use R.

 So in my next guess I must avoid C, R, A, N.

 Therefore, ""TIMER"" is invalid because of R.

 Similarly, we must ensure we avoid C, R, A, N.

 Now, back to ""MODEL"": 
   Contains M, O, D, E, L -> safe.

 We can also consider ""BIKED"": but has K? 
   ""BIKED"": B, I, K, E, D -> distinct, E in position 4? 

 But note: we haven't tested B, I, K, D either.

 However, ""MODEL"" seems more common.

 Another common word: ""GOURD"": but missing E? 

 We must include E? Yes, because we need to figure out where E is.

 We are required to guess a valid English word. 

 After thinking, I'll choose ""MODEL"".

 Let me confirm if ""MODEL"" is a valid word: yes.

 So guess: MODEL<thought>
Previous feedback for ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-).  
This means:  
- Letters C, R, A, N are ABSENT from the secret word.  
- Letter E is PRESENT but not in the 5th position (since it was guessed there and got ""-"").  
- The secret word contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.  

For the next guess:  
- Must include E in a position other than 5 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4) to test its location.  
- Must avoid using C, R, A, N entirely.  
- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, D, I, M) to maximize information.  

Considering words with E in position 4 to test a new spot while including other common letters:  
- ""MODEL"": Places E in position 4 (new position to test), uses distinct unused letters (M, O, D, E, L), all valid.  
- Alternatives like ""TIMES"" (E in pos 4) invalid due to R; ""POISE"" (E in pos 5) invalid as E can't be in pos 5; ""STEAM"" invalid due to A.  
""MODEL"" efficiently tests E in position 4 and introduces M, O, D, L.

<guess>model</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: model -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) D(x) E(-) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
Meaning:
- C, R, A, N are absent (not in the word at all)
- E is present but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 and got ""-"")

Guess 2: ""model"" -> M(x), O(x), D(x), E(-), L(x)
Meaning:
- M, O, D, L are absent (not in the word at all)
- E is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 and got ""-"")

Combining the feedback:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L
- Present letter: E (but not in position 4 or 5)

Since E is present and not in position 4 or 5, it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

We have used 8 letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L.

We need to guess a word that:
- Includes E in position 1, 2, or 3 (to find its correct position)
- Does not use any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L
- Uses new common letters to maximize information

Available common letters: We have not tested: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: E is the only known present letter so far.

We should try to place E in a new position: either 1, 2, or 3. Since we tried position 4 and 5, we have positions 1,2,3 left.

We also want to test as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters left: S, T, P, U, I, B, F, G, H, etc.

Let's think of words that have E in position 1, 2, or 3 and use common letters.

Option 1: E in position 1
  Examples: 
    ""E"" _ _ _ _ 
    Words: ""EPOXY"" (but O is absent, so invalid), ""ETHIC"" (H and C, but C is absent) -> invalid.
    ""EJECT"" (E, J, E, C, T) -> repeated E and C absent -> invalid.
    ""EIGHT"" (E, I, G, H, T) -> all new letters? 
        Letters: E, I, G, H, T -> distinct, and I, G, H, T are new.

Option 2: E in position 2
  Examples:
    _ ""E"" _ _ _
    ""PENIS"" (P, E, N, I, S) -> but N is absent -> invalid.
    ""BESET"" (B, E, S, E, T) -> repeated E -> less informative? But we don't know if there are two E's? 
        However, we have only one E confirmed so far, but there could be two. But to maximize information, distinct letters are better.
    ""FETUS"" (F, E, T, U, S) -> distinct, new letters.

Option 3: E in position 3
  Examples:
    _ _ ""E"" _ _
    ""SPEED"" (S, P, E, E, D) -> repeated E and D is absent -> invalid.
    ""TWEET"" (T, W, E, E, T) -> repeated and T at both ends? 
    ""QUEEN"" (Q, U, E, E, N) -> repeated and N absent -> invalid.
    ""PIECE"" (P, I, E, C, E) -> repeated and C absent -> invalid.

After reviewing, let's consider:

For E in position 1: ""EIGHT"" seems valid: E, I, G, H, T -> all new and distinct.

For E in position 2: ""FETUS"": F, E, T, U, S -> distinct and new.

For E in position 3: It's harder to find a word without the absent letters. 
  ""SWEPT"" (S, W, E, P, T) -> but P and T are new? 
  However, note: we have not tested S, W, E, P, T -> all are available.

But ""SWEPT"" has E in position 3.

We can also consider ""SWEET"" but repeated E -> less informative.

Now, which one to choose? We want to cover more common letters.

Common letters: S, T, I, P, U, etc.

""EIGHT"" uses I, G, H, T -> G and H are less common? 
""FETUS"" uses F, T, U, S -> F and U are medium, S and T are very common.
""SWEPT"" uses S, W, E, P, T -> W is less common, but S, P, T are common.

We might also consider ""PIETY"": P, I, E, T, Y -> E in position 3? 
  But Y is at the end? 
  Letters: P, I, E, T, Y -> distinct, and we haven't tested P, I, T, Y.

But note: we have to avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,N,M,O,D,L.

""PIETY"" is valid? Yes, meaning piety.

Similarly, ""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T -> E in position 4? But we know E is not in position 4 (from guess 2: E in position 4 got ""-""). So we cannot put E in position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it's not there. So we should avoid position 4 and 5 for E.

Therefore, for E in position 3: ""PIETY"" has E in position 3? 
  P-I-E-T-Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:T, 5:Y -> so E is in position 3.

Similarly, ""SWEPT"": S-W-E-P-T -> E in position 3.

Now, comparing:

- ""EIGHT"": E in pos1, tests I,G,H,T
- ""FETUS"": E in pos2, tests F,T,U,S
- ""PIETY"": E in pos3, tests P,I,T,Y
- ""SWEPT"": E in pos3, tests S,W,E,P,T

We want to test the most common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A, O, N are absent. So T, I, S are very common.

""FETUS"" has S and T, and also U and F.
""PIETY"" has P, I, T, Y.
""SWEPT"" has S, W, P, T.

""FETUS"" and ""SWEPT"" both have S and T.

But note: we have two positions to test for E: 1,2,3. We haven't tested position 1 and 2 yet? We tested 4 and 5, so 1,2,3 are open.

We might want to test a position we haven't tried: position 1 or 2.

So ""EIGHT"" tests position 1, ""FETUS"" tests position 2, and ""PIETY"" or ""SWEPT"" test position 3.

Since we have no information about position 1 and 2, it might be better to test one of them.

I think ""FETUS"" is a good candidate because it tests E in position 2 and includes S and T, which are common.

But let's see if there's a word that tests E in position 1 and includes S and T? 

For example: ""ETUIS"" is not common? 
  ""ETHOS"" -> but H and O, O is absent -> invalid.
  ""ESTUS"" -> not a word? 
  ""EXIST"": E, X, I, S, T -> E in position 1, and X is a bit rare, but it's valid. 
  ""EXIST"" uses E, X, I, S, T -> distinct, and we test E in position 1, and I, S, T.

But X is less common, so ""FETUS"" might be better because it uses more common letters? 

However, ""FETUS"" has F and U, which are less common than S and T? But S and T are in ""FETUS"".

""FETUS"": F, E, T, U, S -> letters: F, T, U, S, and E.

""EXIST"": E, X, I, S, T -> E, X, I, S, T.

I think ""EXIST"" is acceptable, but let's see if we can find a word with E in position 1 and without rare letters.

Another: ""EDITS"": E, D, I, T, S -> but D is absent (from guess 2: D(x)) -> invalid.

""ESTOP"": E, S, T, O, P -> O is absent -> invalid.

""SPEED"" -> repeated E and D absent.

So ""EXIST"" might be one of the few options for E in position 1.

But we can also consider E in position 2 with more common letters: 

""BEST"": too short.
""JEST"": J is less common? 
""TESTY"": T, E, S, T, Y -> repeated T -> less informative.
""PEST"": too short.

""FETUS"" seems reasonable.

Alternatively, ""SUITE"": S, U, I, T, E -> but E is in position 5 -> we know E is not in position 5, so we should avoid. 

""SUITE"" would have E at the end -> not allowed.

So I think ""FETUS"" is a good choice.

But let's check the word: ""FETUS"" is a valid Wordle word.

We'll get feedback on E in position 2 and the letters F, T, U, S.

If E is in position 2, we get a ""✓"" for E? Or if not, we get a ""-"" and know it's in 1 or 3.

So I'll go with ""FETUS"".

But note: we have to output in the required format.

Another candidate: ""PIETY"" for E in position 3? But we haven't tested position 1 or 2 for E, so it might be better to test position 1 or 2 first.

We have limited guesses, so we need to maximize information.

I think testing E in position 2 is a good middle ground.

So guess: FETUS

But let me confirm the letters: F, E, T, U, S -> all not in the absent list.

Yes.

So the next guess is ""FETUS"".<thought>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Letters C, R, A, N are ABSENT (x). E is PRESENT but not in position 5 (-).
- **Guess 2 (""model"")**: Letters M, O, D, L are ABSENT (x). E is PRESENT but not in position 4 (-).

**Key insights**:
- The secret word contains the letter E, but it cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (since both placements resulted in ""-""). Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Absent letters (cannot be used): C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L (8 letters eliminated).
- Present letters: Only E is confirmed so far (position unknown in 1–3).
- Goal: Test E in a new position (1, 2, or 3) while introducing common unused letters to maximize information.

**Strategy for next guess**:
- Place E in position 2 (untested position) to narrow its location.
- Use distinct, common unused letters: Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, P) and vowels (e.g., I, U) not yet tested.
- Avoid absent letters strictly.
- **Chosen word: ""FETUS""**  
  - F (new), E (position 2), T (new), U (new), S (new).  
  - Tests E in position 2 and introduces 4 new common letters (S, T, F, U).  
  - If E is in position 2, it gets ""✓""; if not, we rule out position 2 and learn E is in 1 or 3.  
  - S and T are highly frequent, increasing chances of hits.  

Alternatives like ""EXIST"" (E in pos 1) or ""PIETY"" (E in pos 3) were considered, but ""FETUS"" balances common letters and positional testing best.

Like ""SLEPT"", but note we haven\'t tested S, L, P, T.\n\n However, let\'s check our constraints: \n Cannot use: C, R, A, N.\n\n We can use: B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Since we know E is in the word (somewhere except the last), let\'s prioritize words that place E in a different position than last.\n\n Let me list some candidate words:\n   Positions for E: We want to try E in positions 1,2,3,4 to gain positional information.\n\n For instance:\n   E in position 1 examples: \n     ""E"" _ _ _ _ -> e.g., ""EJECT"" has repeated E and uses J and T? But repeated E might not be ideal? Also, we don\'t know if there are multiple E\'s. However, let\'s avoid repeats for maximum information? But the word might have repeated letters.\n\n However, we can assume for now that the word might not have repeats? Actually, Wordle words can have repeated letters.\n\n But for efficiency, we might avoid repeats unless necessary.\n\n Let me think: \n   We know E is present. But we don\'t know if there\'s more than one E. So we should not rule that out.\n\n However, since we only have 6 tries, we should aim for words with 5 distinct letters to test more.\n\n Therefore, let\'s choose a word with E and four new distinct letters, all not C,R,A,N.\n\n Candidate: \n   Example: ""STEEL"" has repeated E -> not distinct. So skip.\n   Another: ""OUCHY"" doesn\'t have E -> invalid.\n\n We must include E.\n\n Another: ""SLEEK"" has repeated E -> less informative.\n\n So I\'ll aim for words where E is included and the rest are distinct and new.\n\n Common word: ""TIMES"": \n   T, I, M, E, S -> distinct, has E in position 4? \n   But E was in position 5 in the first guess and now we are putting it in position 4? That might be good to test.\n\n However, we know E cannot be in position 5? Actually, the feedback said E was present but not in position 5, so position 5 is ruled out for E. But positions 1-4 are still possible.\n\n How about ""HOUSE""? \n   H, O, U, S, E -> distinct, E at end? But E cannot be at position 5? Actually, we cannot put E at position 5 because we already know it\'s not there. So HOUSE would have E in the last position again -> which we know is wrong -> it will give a ""-"" but we already know that. \n\n   So we should avoid putting E in the fifth position to avoid wasting a letter slot.\n\n Therefore, we should place E in one of the positions: 1,2,3, or 4.\n\n Let\'s try E in position 4? \n   Example: ""STOLE"" -> S T O L E: E is in position 5 -> same problem.\n\n We need to put E in positions 1,2, or 3? \n\n Word: ""STEAM"" -> E in position 3? STEAM: \n   S, T, E, A, M -> but A is already ruled out! Because we got A(x) in first guess. \n\n So we cannot use A.\n\n How about ""STEPS"": \n   S, T, E, P, S -> repeated S? And S at positions 1 and 5? That\'s two letters? So let\'s avoid repeats.\n\n Another: ""DEPOT"": \n   D, E, P, O, T -> distinct letters, E in position 2? This seems good.\n   Letters: D, E, P, O, T -> none are C,R,A,N.\n\n But we haven\'t tested D, P, O, T yet. \n\n Another good word: ""DOZEN"": \n   D, O, Z, E, N -> however, N is ruled out, so we can\'t use N.\n\n We must avoid N.\n\n How about ""PLEAD"": \n   P, L, E, A, D -> but A is ruled out.\n\n So let\'s avoid A.\n\n Another: ""MODEL"": \n   M, O, D, E, L -> distinct? M, O, D, E, L -> yes. And E is in position 4? \n   Positions: M (1), O (2), D (3), E (4), L (5). \n   Since E is in position 4 and we know it\'s not in 5, but position 4 might be a new position.\n\n However, note: the secret word has E in another position, but we don\'t know if position 4 is the correct one? So it\'s okay to test.\n\n But let me see if there\'s a better word: \n   ""MEDIC"" -> contains C, ruled out.\n\n Another: ""FIELD"": \n   F, I, E, L, D -> distinct, E in position 3?\n\n But let me think: we want to cover more vowels or common letters. \n\n We haven\'t tried L, O, T? \n\n Considering ""DOZEN"" is invalid (has N). How about ""WOVEN""? again has N.\n\n Another common word: ""OILED"": \n   O, I, L, E, D -> distinct, E in position 4? \n   Or ""TOWEL"": has E at position 4? \n\n But note: ""TOWEL"": T, O, W, E, L -> distinct, and E in position 4.\n\n How about ""POISE"": \n   P, O, I, S, E -> distinct? Yes. But E is at the end - position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n So words ending with E are no good for our purpose? Because we\'ll get an immediate ""minus"" but we already know E isn\'t in last.\n\n But if we put E in position 5 again, then we are wasting the last letter slot? So let\'s avoid.\n\n After avoiding position 5 for E, I can use words that have E in positions 1,2,3,4.\n\n Now, let\'s find a word with E in position 1? \n   Examples: \n     ""E"" ... -> ""EPOXY"": E, P, O, X, Y -> distinct? Yes. And X and Y are less common? \n     ""ELITE"": repeated E -> less distinct letters.\n\n Another: ""ETHIC"": has C -> invalid.\n\n ""EDGES"": repeated E? And S at end? \n   But E at position 1 and then at the end? Avoid repeated? \n\n How about ""ENSUE""? repeated E? \n\n I think ""MODEL"" is a decent choice: positions 1:M, 2:O, 3:D, 4:E, 5:L -> so E in position 4.\n\n Or ""DIET"": too short, need 5 letters.\n\n Let me go with ""MODEL"": \n   M, O, D, E, L -> all new distinct letters, E in position 4.\n\n But note: if E is in the secret word and is not in position 5, but we put it in position 4, we\'ll get:\n   - If it is in position 4: then we get a ""✓""\n   - If it is in position 1,2, or 3: then we get ""-"" for position 4.\n\n So we will get more information.\n\n Alternatively, we might try to put E in a completely different position? For example, first guess E was in position 5, so let\'s try position 1? \n\n Another candidate: ""ELOPE"": E in position 1? But has repeated E? \n\n ""ESCORT"" has C -> invalid.\n\n ""EXIST"": E in position 1? X, I, S, T -> distinct? Yes. \n   Letters: E, X, I, S, T -> avoid S? Why? We haven\'t tested S yet. \n\n I think ""EXIST"" is a possible word.\n\n But note: we can use words even with less common letters? \n\n Considering commonality: \n   Common letters: S, T, I, O, L, etc. \n\n ""EXIST"" has E, X, I, S, T -> X is very infrequent.\n\n How about ""LOUIE"": has repeated I? Not distinct.\n\n Another: ""QUIET"": Q and E - Q is less common? \n\n After review, I think ""MODEL"" is acceptable.\n\n But another idea: we might try ""SPIEL"": \n   S, P, I, E, L -> distinct? Yes. E in position 4? \n   Or ""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E -> E in position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n ""SPIEL"": E in position 4.\n\n ""SLIDE"": \n   S, L, I, D, E -> E in position 5? No.\n\n ""DEUCE"": D, E, U, C, E -> contains C and repeated E -> invalid.\n\n I\'ll go with ""MODEL"": \n   We test M, O, D, E, L -> E in position 4.\n\n Or ""POISE"" but ends with E -> avoid.\n\n Alternative: ""TIMER"": \n   T, I, M, E, R -> distinct? Yes. E in position 4? \n   But R was already ruled out by first guess! Because first guess ""crane"" had R at position 2 and got ""x"", so R is not in the word.\n\n So we cannot use R.\n\n So in my next guess I must avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Therefore, ""TIMER"" is invalid because of R.\n\n Similarly, we must ensure we avoid C, R, A, N.\n\n Now, back to ""MODEL"": \n   Contains M, O, D, E, L -> safe.\n\n We can also consider ""BIKED"": but has K? \n   ""BIKED"": B, I, K, E, D -> distinct, E in position 4? \n\n But note: we haven\'t tested B, I, K, D either.\n\n However, ""MODEL"" seems more common.\n\n Another common word: ""GOURD"": but missing E? \n\n We must include E? Yes, because we need to figure out where E is.\n\n We are required to guess a valid English word. \n\n After thinking, I\'ll choose ""MODEL"".\n\n Let me confirm if ""MODEL"" is a valid word: yes.\n\n So guess: MODEL<thought>\nPrevious feedback for ""crane"": C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-).  \nThis means:  \n- Letters C, R, A, N are ABSENT from the secret word.  \n- Letter E is PRESENT but not in the 5th position (since it was guessed there and got ""-"").  \n- The secret word contains E somewhere in positions 1-4.  \n\nFor the next guess:  \n- Must include E in a position other than 5 (positions 1, 2, 3, or 4) to test its location.  \n- Must avoid using C, R, A, N entirely.  \n- Should prioritize common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, L, D, I, M) to maximize information.  \n\nConsidering words with E in position 4 to test a new spot while including other common letters:  \n- ""MODEL"": Places E in position 4 (new position to test), uses distinct unused letters (M, O, D, E, L), all valid.  \n- Alternatives like ""TIMES"" (E in pos 4) invalid due to R; ""POISE"" (E in pos 5) invalid as E can\'t be in pos 5; ""STEAM"" invalid due to A.  \n""MODEL"" efficiently tests E in position 4 and introduces M, O, D, L.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>model</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: model -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) D(x) E(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have two guesses and their feedback:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C, R, A, N are absent (not in the word at all)\n- E is present but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 and got ""-"")\n\nGuess 2: ""model"" -> M(x), O(x), D(x), E(-), L(x)\nMeaning:\n- M, O, D, L are absent (not in the word at all)\n- E is present but not in position 4 (since it was in position 4 and got ""-"")\n\nCombining the feedback:\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L\n- Present letter: E (but not in position 4 or 5)\n\nSince E is present and not in position 4 or 5, it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n\nWe have used 8 letters that are absent: C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L.\n\nWe need to guess a word that:\n- Includes E in position 1, 2, or 3 (to find its correct position)\n- Does not use any of the absent letters: C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L\n- Uses new common letters to maximize information\n\nAvailable common letters: We have not tested: B, F, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: E is the only known present letter so far.\n\nWe should try to place E in a new position: either 1, 2, or 3.

We want to cover more common letters.\n\nCommon letters: S, T, I, P, U, etc.\n\n""EIGHT"" uses I, G, H, T -> G and H are less common? \n""FETUS"" uses F, T, U, S -> F and U are medium, S and T are very common.\n""SWEPT"" uses S, W, E, P, T -> W is less common, but S, P, T are common.\n\nWe might also consider ""PIETY"": P, I, E, T, Y -> E in position 3? \n  But Y is at the end? \n  Letters: P, I, E, T, Y -> distinct, and we haven\'t tested P, I, T, Y.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid the absent letters: C,R,A,N,M,O,D,L.\n\n""PIETY"" is valid? Yes, meaning piety.\n\nSimilarly, ""QUIET"": Q, U, I, E, T -> E in position 4? But we know E is not in position 4 (from guess 2: E in position 4 got ""-""). So we cannot put E in position 4 again? Actually, we can, but it would be a waste because we already know it\'s not there. So we should avoid position 4 and 5 for E.\n\nTherefore, for E in position 3: ""PIETY"" has E in position 3? \n  P-I-E-T-Y -> positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:E, 4:T, 5:Y -> so E is in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""SWEPT"": S-W-E-P-T -> E in position 3.\n\nNow, comparing:\n\n- ""EIGHT"": E in pos1, tests I,G,H,T\n- ""FETUS"": E in pos2, tests F,T,U,S\n- ""PIETY"": E in pos3, tests P,I,T,Y\n- ""SWEPT"": E in pos3, tests S,W,E,P,T\n\nWe want to test the most common letters. The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, ... but we know A, O, N are absent. So T, I, S are very common.\n\n""FETUS"" has S and T, and also U and F.\n""PIETY"" has P, I, T, Y.\n""SWEPT"" has S, W, P, T.\n\n""FETUS"" and ""SWEPT"" both have S and T.\n\nBut note: we have two positions to test for E: 1,2,3. We haven\'t tested position 1 and 2 yet? We tested 4 and 5, so 1,2,3 are open.\n\nWe might want to test a position we haven\'t tried: position 1 or 2.\n\nSo ""EIGHT"" tests position 1, ""FETUS"" tests position 2, and ""PIETY"" or ""SWEPT"" test position 3.\n\nSince we have no information about position 1 and 2, it might be better to test one of them.\n\nI think ""FETUS"" is a good candidate because it tests E in position 2 and includes S and T, which are common.\n\nBut let\'s see if there\'s a word that tests E in position 1 and includes S and T? \n\nFor example: ""ETUIS"" is not common? \n  ""ETHOS"" -> but H and O, O is absent -> invalid.\n  ""ESTUS"" -> not a word? \n  ""EXIST"": E, X, I, S, T -> E in position 1, and X is a bit rare, but it\'s valid. \n  ""EXIST"" uses E, X, I, S, T -> distinct, and we test E in position 1, and I, S, T.\n\nBut X is less common, so ""FETUS"" might be better because it uses more common letters? \n\nHowever, ""FETUS"" has F and U, which are less common than S and T? But S and T are in ""FETUS"".\n\n""FETUS"": F, E, T, U, S -> letters: F, T, U, S, and E.\n\n""EXIST"": E, X, I, S, T -> E, X, I, S, T.\n\nI think ""EXIST"" is acceptable, but let\'s see if we can find a word with E in position 1 and without rare letters.\n\nAnother: ""EDITS"": E, D, I, T, S -> but D is absent (from guess 2: D(x)) -> invalid.\n\n""ESTOP"": E, S, T, O, P -> O is absent -> invalid.\n\n""SPEED"" -> repeated E and D absent.\n\nSo ""EXIST"" might be one of the few options for E in position 1.\n\nBut we can also consider E in position 2 with more common letters: \n\n""BEST"": too short.\n""JEST"": J is less common? \n""TESTY"": T, E, S, T, Y -> repeated T -> less informative.\n""PEST"": too short.\n\n""FETUS"" seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, ""SUITE"": S, U, I, T, E -> but E is in position 5 -> we know E is not in position 5, so we should avoid. \n\n""SUITE"" would have E at the end -> not allowed.\n\nSo I think ""FETUS"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let\'s check the word: ""FETUS"" is a valid Wordle word.\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on E in position 2 and the letters F, T, U, S.\n\nIf E is in position 2, we get a ""✓"" for E? Or if not, we get a ""-"" and know it\'s in 1 or 3.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""FETUS"".\n\nBut note: we have to output in the required format.\n\nAnother candidate: ""PIETY"" for E in position 3? But we haven\'t tested position 1 or 2 for E, so it might be better to test position 1 or 2 first.\n\nWe have limited guesses, so we need to maximize information.\n\nI think testing E in position 2 is a good middle ground.\n\nSo guess: FETUS\n\nBut let me confirm the letters: F, E, T, U, S -> all not in the absent list.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the next guess is ""FETUS"".<thought>\nAfter analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Letters C, R, A, N are ABSENT (x). E is PRESENT but not in position 5 (-).\n- **Guess 2 (""model"")**: Letters M, O, D, L are ABSENT (x). E is PRESENT but not in position 4 (-).\n\n**Key insights**:\n- The secret word contains the letter E, but it cannot be in positions 4 or 5 (since both placements resulted in ""-""). Therefore, E must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- Absent letters (cannot be used): C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L (8 letters eliminated).\n- Present letters: Only E is confirmed so far (position unknown in 1–3).\n- Goal: Test E in a new position (1, 2, or 3) while introducing common unused letters to maximize information.\n\n**Strategy for next guess**:\n- Place E in position 2 (untested position) to narrow its location.\n- Use distinct, common unused letters: Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, T, P) and vowels (e.g., I, U) not yet tested.\n- Avoid absent letters strictly.\n- **Chosen word: ""FETUS""**  \n  - F (new), E (position 2), T (new), U (new), S (new).  \n  - Tests E in position 2 and introduces 4 new common letters (S, T, F, U).  \n  - If E is in position 2, it gets ""✓""; if not, we rule out position 2 and learn E is in 1 or 3.  \n  - S and T are highly frequent, increasing chances of hits.  \n\nAlternatives like ""EXIST"" (E in pos 1) or ""PIETY"" (E in pos 3) were considered, but ""FETUS"" balances common letters and positional testing best.\n</thought>\n\n<guess>fetus</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: model -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) D(x) E(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: fetus -> FEEDBACK: F(x) E(-) T(-) U(x) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have three guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
- So E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""model"" -> M(x), O(x), D(x), E(-), L(x)
- E is present but not in position 4.

Guess 3: ""fetus"" -> F(x), E(-), T(-), U(x), S(-)
- F and U are absent (x).
- E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and got ""-"").
- T is present but not in position 3 (since guessed in position 3, got ""-"").
- S is present but not in position 5 (since guessed in position 5, got ""-"").

Now, combining all:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L, F, U (all x)
- Present letters: E, T, S (all are in the word, but in wrong positions as per the guesses)

We know:
- E must be in position 1 or 3 (because it cannot be in 2,4,5 as per feedback).
- T must be in the word, but not in position 3 (from guess 3, position 3 got ""-"").
- S must be in the word, but not in position 5 (from guess 3, position 5 got ""-"").

From the feedback, E, T, S are all present.

Possible positions for E: only 1 or 3.

Let's recap positions:
- E was tried in position 5 (crane) -> wrong
- E was tried in position 4 (model) -> wrong
- E was tried in position 2 (fetus) -> wrong
So only positions 1 and 3 left.

Similarly, T was tried in position 3 (fetus) -> wrong, so T cannot be in position 3.
S was tried in position 5 (fetus) -> wrong, so S cannot be in position 5.

We need to guess a word that:
- Includes E, T, S (since they are present)
- Does not use any absent letters: C,R,A,N,M,O,D,L,F,U
- Places E in position 1 or 3? But also, we have to place T and S in positions where they haven't been tried before? Not exactly, but we know which positions are wrong for them.

Specifically:
- T cannot be in position 3 (from fetus)
- S cannot be in position 5 (from fetus)
- E must be in position 1 or 3.

Moreover, we need to include two more letters? Since the word has 5 letters and we have three already: E, T, S.

We have E, T, S present, so the word has these three plus two other letters which must be chosen from the remaining unused letters.

Available letters (not absent): B, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we must form a valid English word.

Also, we need to assign positions for E, T, S.

Let's consider cases:

Case 1: E in position 1.
Then the word: E _ _ _ _

We need to place T and S in positions other than their incorrect ones:
- T cannot be in position 3 -> so T can be in 2,4,5? But note: we haven't tried T in any position before? Only in position 3, which is bad. But other positions might be ok.
- S cannot be in position 5 -> so S can be in position 2,3,4.

Similarly, the other two letters must be chosen from the available pool.

Case 2: E in position 3.
Then the word: _ _ E _ _

And T and S must be placed with constraints.

Now, we can try both cases? But we have to pick one guess.

Moreover, we know that in the secret word:

- E is in 1 or 3.
- T is not in 3.
- S is not in 5.

Now, let's think of words that satisfy:

For Case 1: E in position 1.
Possible words: 
  E _ _ _ _
  Must include T and S.

For example: 
  ""E"" and then T in position 2? or 4 or 5? S in position 3 or 4? 

Also, the other two letters must be present? Actually, there might be repeated letters? But so far we haven't encountered any repeats.

We don't know if there are repeats, but for now we can assume distinct?

But E, T, S are distinct? Yes.

So the word has E,T,S and two other letters.

Example words with E at start:

  ""EDITS"" -> but D is absent -> invalid.
  ""EGEST"" -> E,G,E,S,T -> repeated E? And S at the end? But S cannot be in position 5 -> invalid because we know S is present and not in 5.

  ""EJECT"" -> contains C -> invalid.

So let's avoid the absent letters.

Possible words: 
  ""E"" and then: B, G, H, I, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

For example: ""EPICS"" -> P, I, C, S -> C absent -> invalid.

  ""ETHYL"" -> T, H, Y, L -> L absent -> invalid.

  ""EXPEL"" -> X, P, E, L -> L absent -> invalid.

  ""EIGHT"" -> we tried? Not exactly, but E in 1? We haven't tried ""EIGHT"" in previous guesses? 
    Guess 3 was ""fetus"", not ""eight"". 
    But ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> letters: E, I, G, H, T -> but we need S? Because S is present? 

  Wait, we know S is present, so we must include S.

The word must include S because S is present.

Similarly, must include E and T.

So we need a word with E, T, S.

Therefore, for E in position 1: the word must start with E, include T and S, and two other letters from available, and avoid absent letters.

Possible: E _ _ _ _

We need both T and S in the word.

For example: ""ETUIS"" -> not a valid common word? Etui is a word? Etui: a small case for items? 
  E-T-U-I-S? -> but U is absent -> invalid.

  ""ESTOP"" -> E-S-T-O-P -> O absent -> invalid.

  ""EKS"" -> no.

This is difficult.

Case 2: E in position 3.

Then: _ _ E _ _

Must include T and S.

Constraints: T cannot be in position 3 -> but position 3 is E, so T isn't there anyway? 
And S cannot be in position 5.

Possible positions for T: 1,2,4,5
For S: 1,2,4

But also, we need to fill with two more letters.

Example words:

  ""PISTE"" -> P,I,S,T,E -> S in position 3? But position 3 is E. 
  Positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:S, 4:T, 5:E -> but E is in position 5? But we know E cannot be in position 5 -> invalid.

  ""TIMES"" -> T,I,M,E,S -> M absent -> invalid.

  ""SITES"" -> S,I,T,E,S -> repeated S? And S in position 5? 
    If S is in position 5, we know it cannot be there -> invalid? 
    But we have S also in position 1? 
    ""SITES"": 
      Position 1: S -> S cannot be in position 5? It can be in 1? 
      Feedback from fetus was S in position 5: got ""-"", meaning S is not in position 5. So if we put S in position 1, that might be ok? 
      And E in position 4? But position 3 is not E? 
    Wait: the word is S-I-T-E-S -> position 3 is T, position 4 is E, position 5 is S.

    But E is in position 4 -> but we know E cannot be in position 4 (from model) -> invalid.

  ""BIKES"" -> B,I,K,E,S -> E in position 4 -> but E cannot be in position 4 -> invalid.

  ""YETIS"" -> Y,E,T,I,S -> E in position 2? But in the word ""YETIS"": positions: Y-1, E-2, T-3, I-4, S-5 -> but E cannot be in position 2? From fetus, we tried E in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning E is not in position 2? 
  And S cannot be in position 5? Guess ""yetiS"" has S in position 5 -> invalid because not allowed? 
  But also T is in position 3, which we know is not allowed? 

  We need to avoid:
    E in positions 2,4,5 -> so E can only be in 1 or 3.
    Similarly, T cannot be in position 3? Yes.

Therefore, for E in position 3, the word is: _ _ E _ _

Example: 
  ""  E  "" -> third letter E.

Let's think of ""STEPS"": S,T,E,P,S -> repeated S? And positions: S-1, T-2, E-3, P-4, S-5 -> but S in position 5 is bad? But S-5 is not allowed? 
But feedback for S was in position 5: ""-"", so S-5 is wrong, so we can't put S at 5, but this word puts S at 1 and 5? Position 1 S might be ok, but position 5 S is not allowed? Actually, the secret word might have S only once? We don't know.

But ""STEPS"": 
  We have S in position 1 and 5. Position 5 S is known to be wrong? So it will get a ""-"" again? But if the word has S only in position 1, then S at 5 is wrong and gets ""x""? 
  The feedback rules say: 
    If the letter is in the word but in wrong position: ""-"" 
    If not in word: ""x""
  But if the word has two S's, then it might be different? 

Since we know S is present, but if there is only one S, then in ""STEPS"" guessing S at position 5 when the word has S only at position 1, we'd get:
  Position 1 S: ✓ (if correct) 
  Position 5 S: x (if only one S and it's at 1)
But note: from guess 3 ""fetus"" with S in position 5, we got ""-"", meaning that S is present but not in position 5. So if the word has only one S, that S must be in a position other than 5, so position 5 in ""STEPS"" would get ""x"" if the S is only at position 1? Actually, the feedback system: 

  In ""fetus"", S was at position 5 and we got ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not at position 5. 
  So in a new guess, if we put S at position 5 again, we'd get ""-"" again? Only if there is another occurrence of S? But we don't know.

 To avoid confusion, we should not put S in position 5 because we know it's not there? Therefore, when guessing we should avoid positions we know are wrong for that letter? 

Specifically, for S: we know it's not in position 5, so we shouldn't put it there again? Similarly for E and T.

So for the new guess, we must:
  Put E in position 1 or 3? Not 2,4,5.
  Put S not in position 5.
  Put T not in position 3.

Now, for E in position 3: ""  E  ""

Then what words start with something, then something, then E, then something, then something? with T and S present.

Both T and S must appear in positions 1,2,4,5 for T? But T cannot be in 3? But position 3 is E, so ok.
For S: cannot be in 5? so positions 1,2,4.

Also, the other letters must be from available: B,G,H,I,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And no absent letters.

Let me list candidate words:

  ""SWEET"" -> S,W,E,E,T -> repeated E? And W and T? 
    But E first occurrence in position 3? 
    Positions: S1, W2, E3, E4, T5 -> 
      S in position 1 -> ok (since not 5)
      W new
      E in position 3 -> ok
      E in position 4 -> we know E cannot be in position 4? Contradiction? 
      So if we guess ""sweet"", at position 4 we have E, which we know is not possible -> so the secret word cannot be ""SWEET""? Because E cannot be in position 4? 
      From guess 2, E was tried in position 4 and got ""-"", so position 4 is not E? So ""SWEET"" has E in position 4 -> it would be incorrect? 
      But the actual secret word has only one E? Or two? We don't know.

  If the secret word has two E's: then it is possible? But we only have one E confirmed? But it might be two.

  Let's assume there could be two E's? 

  But from feedback, we know E is present, but we don't know if it appears more than once? 

  However, the feedback we get for duplicate letters is tricky? 

  But in previous guesses, we have had distinct letters? 

  But let's not assume.

  To be safe, we must consider that there might be two E's, but we know E is not in positions 2,4,5? 

E positions:

  Cannot be in 2,4,5 -> position 4 is out? So E can only be in 1 or 3? Or if two E's, a second E could be in 1 or 3 as well? Only positions 1 and 3 are available for E.

So position 4 cannot have E? Therefore, ""SWEET"" would be invalid if the secret word has E in position 4? But we know E is not in position 4? So the secret word cannot have E in position 4? Therefore, if we guess ""sweet"", the position 4 E would get an ""x"" or ""-""? 

  If the secret word has only one E and it is in position 3, then:
    Position 4 E: not in the word? Because only one E? So ""x"".
  If the secret word has two E's, but where? Only positions 1 or 3 for the first one, but the second could be only in one of the other positions? But positions 2,4,5 are out for E, so only positions 1 and 3 can have E? So the second E would have to be in the one not used for the first.

For example, secret word with E at 1 and 3? 
  Position 1: E
  Position 3: E
  Then when we guess ""sweet"", position 1: S? so not E? -> so we'd have:
    Position 1: S -> not E? but if the secret has E in position 1, then S would be compared with E? 

I'm confusing myself.

Perhaps it's better to avoid this complication and guess a word with only one E? Since we haven't had any indication of two E's? 

We only know that E is present, it could be one or more? 

But to simplify, let's assume distinct letters for now? And if not, we'll find out later.

The safe approach is to guess a word with E only in position 1 or 3, and include T and S.

For E in position 3:

  _ _ E _ _

  Have T and S in positions 1,2,4,5 but T not in 3, S not in 5.

  So T in 1,2,4,5? Avoid 3 -> position 3 is taken by E.
  S in 1,2,4.

  So possible assignments:

  Option: put S in position 1, T in position 2? But T in position 2 is ok? 
  Then word: S T E _ _
  Now, the last two letters: must be two new letters from available.

  For example: S T E P ? -> not a 5-letter word? We need 5 letters: positions 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:?, 5:?

  Position 4 and 5 must be two new letters.

  But the word would be ""STEEP""! But then E in position 4? -> not allowed? 
  ""STEEP"": S-T-E-E-P -> has E at position 4 -> bad.

  ""STREW"" -> S,T,R,E,W -> R is absent -> invalid.

  ""STYED"" -> S,T,Y,E,D -> D absent -> invalid.

  ""SPEWY"" -> not a word.

  How about ""STEEP"" is not good.

  Put S in position 4: _ _ E S _

  But then S in position 4? And we need T in 1,2,5? avoiding position 3? but position 3 is E.

  Example: let position 1 be T: T _ E S _ 
  Then positions 2 and 5 must be filled.

  Words: ""TIGES"" -> T,I,G,E,S -> E is in position 4? Not position 3. 
  ""T ** E S *"" is T?ES? not.

  ""T I E S S"" not a word.

  ""TUNES"" -> T,U,N,E,S -> U and N absent -> invalid.

  ""T K E S T"" not a word.

  ""SKEEP"" -> not a word.

  ""STEEK"" -> Scottish word? S not in position 4? S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, E at 4, K at 5 -> but E at 4 not allowed.

It's problematic.

Alternatively, put T in position 1? 

  T _ E _ _
  And S in position 2 or 4.

  If S in position 2: T S E _ _
  Then words: ""T  S  E  _   _"" 
  Example: "" T S E I S"" not valid. ""TSETSE"" -> too long? 
  ""TSETSE"" is 6 letters.

  "" T S E P  "" -> ""tsep""? not a word.

  S in position 4: T _ E S _
  Then we need to fill position 2 and 5.

  Words: ""TIES it's 4 letters? ""TIESS"" not valid.

  ""TWES the a word? 
  ""TWEAK"" -> T,W,E,A,K -> A absent -> invalid.

  ""TWERP"" -> T,W,E,R,P -> R absent -> invalid.

  ""THESP"" -> not a word.

Perhaps E in position 1.

We must try E in position 1.

So Case 1: E in position 1.

Then: E _ _ _ _

Must include T and S.

Constraints:
  S not in position 5 -> so S in 2,3,4.
  T not in position 3 -> so T in 2,4,5? Since position 1 is E.

Positions available: 2,3,4,5 for T and S and two other letters.

Example:
  Put T in position 2: E T _ _ _
  Then S in 3 or 4? Not 5? 
  If S in 3: E T S _ _ 
  If S in 4: E T _ S _ 

  Or put T in position 4: E _ _ T _
  Then S in 2 or 3: E S _ T _ or E _ S T _ 

  etc.

Let's try to find words:

  ""ETRUS"" not valid.
  ""ETC  "" too short.

  ""E  T  S  "" positions: E at 1, T at 5, S at 4? -> E _ _ S T -> but that's positions: 1:E, 2:?, 3:?, 4:S, 5:T
  S is in position 4 -> allowed? (since not 5)
  T is in position 5 -> no constraint on T being in position 5? Only that it cannot be in position 3? So position 5 is ok.

  So pattern: E _ _ S T

  Fill positions 2 and 3 with available letters.

  Available: B,G,H,I,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

  Examples: 
    ""E H S T"" not.
    ""EIGHTS"" -> not 5 letters.
    ""E T S T"" to ""ESTT"" not.

  ""E  something at 2, something at 3, S at 4, T at 5""

  ""E Q I S T"" -> ""equist"" not a word.

  ""E J S T"" not. 

  ""E G I S T"" -> ""egist"" not a common word? But ""egis"" is a word but 4 letters? Or ""egress"" is 6.

  ""ENTST"" not.

  ""EPIST"" -> epis is a prefix? ""epistle"" too long.

  ""EWEST"" -> not a word.

  ""EXIST"" -> E,X,I,S,T -> letters: E,X,I,S,T -> all distinct? 
  Positions: E-1, X-2, I-3, S-4, T-5 -> 
    S-4 -> not position 5? Allowed.
    T-5 -> allowed (no constraint on position 5 for T? Only not position 3)
  But we haven't tested X, I.

  And no absent letters? C,R,A,N,M,O,D,L,F,U are absent, but X and I are not used.

  ""EXIST"" is a valid word.

  Also, ""exist"" includes E at position 1, S at position 4 (not 5), T at position 5 (not 3).

  So it satisfies the constraints.

Similarly, are there other words? 

  ""EDIST"" -> D absent -> invalid.

  ""E G S T"" -> not a word.

  ""E W I S T"" -> ""ewist"" not a word? But ""twist"" not with E.

  ""EXIST"" seems good.

In guess 3, we got ""F(x) E(-) T(-) U(x) S(-)"" for ""fetus"", which means:

  E: present, but not in position 2? So in position 1 or 3.

  S: present, but not in position 5.

  T: present, but not in position 3.

""EXIST"" has:

  E in position 1: we don't know if it's correct or only present? but we'll see feedback.

  T in position 5: okay.

  S in position 4: okay.

  X and I are new.

So we can guess ""EXIST"". 

If the secret word has E in position 1, then we might get a ""✓"" for E? Or if E is in position 3, then position 1 might get a ""x"" or ""-""? We'll see.

But in this guess, we are testing Position 1 for E? Which is one of the two options.

Also, we are testing other letters.

So let's go with ""EXIST"".

But is it valid? Yes.

Another option: ""PIETY"" we considered earlier, but it doesn't include S.

We must include S.

Or ""piste"" but with the positions wrong.

So ""EXIST"" is a good choice.

Guess: EXIST

But we already used ""fetus"" with similar letters? Not exactly.

So output in the required format.
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Eliminated C, R, A, N (✓: E at pos 5 is wrong, so E is present elsewhere).
- **Guess 2 (""model"")**: Eliminated M, O, D, L (✓: E at pos 4 is wrong).
- **Guess 3 (""fetus"")**: Eliminated F, U. Confirmed E (-), T (-), S (-), with constraints:
  - E is present but not in positions 2, 4, or 5 → must be in position 1 or 3.
  - T is present but not in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
  - S is present but not in position 5 → must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Remaining letters must be from unused pool:  B, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

**Strategy for Guess 4**:
- Test E in position 1 (untested position) since position 3 may be harder to fit with T/S constraints.
- Prioritize high-frequency letters like I and S to maximize chances of hits.
- Avoid absent letters and wrong positions.
- **Chosen word: ""EXIST""**:
  - E in position 1 (tests E at untested pos 1).
  - S in position 4 (avoids pos 5, new position).
  - T in position 5 (avoids pos 3, new position).
  - Introduces new common letters I (position 3) and X (position 2).
  - Valid English word, efficient setup: if E is in pos 1, it gets ✓; else, rules out pos 1.

<guess>exist</guess>",exist,"We have three guesses and their feedback:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(-)
- So E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""model"" -> M(x), O(x), D(x), E(-), L(x)
- E is present but not in position 4.

Guess 3: ""fetus"" -> F(x), E(-), T(-), U(x), S(-)
- F and U are absent (x).
- E is present but not in position 2 (since it was guessed in position 2 and got ""-"").
- T is present but not in position 3 (since guessed in position 3, got ""-"").
- S is present but not in position 5 (since guessed in position 5, got ""-"").

Now, combining all:
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, M, O, D, L, F, U (all x)
- Present letters: E, T, S (all are in the word, but in wrong positions as per the guesses)

We know:
- E must be in position 1 or 3 (because it cannot be in 2,4,5 as per feedback).
- T must be in the word, but not in position 3 (from guess 3, position 3 got ""-"").
- S must be in the word, but not in position 5 (from guess 3, position 5 got ""-"").

From the feedback, E, T, S are all present.

Possible positions for E: only 1 or 3.

Let's recap positions:
- E was tried in position 5 (crane) -> wrong
- E was tried in position 4 (model) -> wrong
- E was tried in position 2 (fetus) -> wrong
So only positions 1 and 3 left.

Similarly, T was tried in position 3 (fetus) -> wrong, so T cannot be in position 3.
S was tried in position 5 (fetus) -> wrong, so S cannot be in position 5.

We need to guess a word that:
- Includes E, T, S (since they are present)
- Does not use any absent letters: C,R,A,N,M,O,D,L,F,U
- Places E in position 1 or 3? But also, we have to place T and S in positions where they haven't been tried before? Not exactly, but we know which positions are wrong for them.

Specifically:
- T cannot be in position 3 (from fetus)
- S cannot be in position 5 (from fetus)
- E must be in position 1 or 3.

Moreover, we need to include two more letters? Since the word has 5 letters and we have three already: E, T, S.

We have E, T, S present, so the word has these three plus two other letters which must be chosen from the remaining unused letters.

Available letters (not absent): B, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But we must form a valid English word.

Also, we need to assign positions for E, T, S.

Let's consider cases:

Case 1: E in position 1.
Then the word: E _ _ _ _

We need to place T and S in positions other than their incorrect ones:
- T cannot be in position 3 -> so T can be in 2,4,5? But note: we haven't tried T in any position before? Only in position 3, which is bad. But other positions might be ok.
- S cannot be in position 5 -> so S can be in position 2,3,4.

Similarly, the other two letters must be chosen from the available pool.

Case 2: E in position 3.
Then the word: _ _ E _ _

And T and S must be placed with constraints.

Now, we can try both cases? But we have to pick one guess.

Moreover, we know that in the secret word:

- E is in 1 or 3.
- T is not in 3.
- S is not in 5.

Now, let's think of words that satisfy:

For Case 1: E in position 1.
Possible words: 
  E _ _ _ _
  Must include T and S.

For example: 
  ""E"" and then T in position 2? or 4 or 5? S in position 3 or 4? 

Also, the other two letters must be present? Actually, there might be repeated letters? But so far we haven't encountered any repeats.

We don't know if there are repeats, but for now we can assume distinct?

But E, T, S are distinct? Yes.

So the word has E,T,S and two other letters.

Example words with E at start:

  ""EDITS"" -> but D is absent -> invalid.
  ""EGEST"" -> E,G,E,S,T -> repeated E? And S at the end? But S cannot be in position 5 -> invalid because we know S is present and not in 5.

  ""EJECT"" -> contains C -> invalid.

So let's avoid the absent letters.

Possible words: 
  ""E"" and then: B, G, H, I, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

For example: ""EPICS"" -> P, I, C, S -> C absent -> invalid.

  ""ETHYL"" -> T, H, Y, L -> L absent -> invalid.

  ""EXPEL"" -> X, P, E, L -> L absent -> invalid.

  ""EIGHT"" -> we tried? Not exactly, but E in 1? We haven't tried ""EIGHT"" in previous guesses? 
    Guess 3 was ""fetus"", not ""eight"". 
    But ""EIGHT"": E, I, G, H, T -> letters: E, I, G, H, T -> but we need S? Because S is present? 

  Wait, we know S is present, so we must include S.

The word must include S because S is present.

Similarly, must include E and T.

So we need a word with E, T, S.

Therefore, for E in position 1: the word must start with E, include T and S, and two other letters from available, and avoid absent letters.

Possible: E _ _ _ _

We need both T and S in the word.

For example: ""ETUIS"" -> not a valid common word? Etui is a word? Etui: a small case for items? 
  E-T-U-I-S? -> but U is absent -> invalid.

  ""ESTOP"" -> E-S-T-O-P -> O absent -> invalid.

  ""EKS"" -> no.

This is difficult.

Case 2: E in position 3.

Then: _ _ E _ _

Must include T and S.

Constraints: T cannot be in position 3 -> but position 3 is E, so T isn't there anyway? 
And S cannot be in position 5.

Possible positions for T: 1,2,4,5
For S: 1,2,4

But also, we need to fill with two more letters.

Example words:

  ""PISTE"" -> P,I,S,T,E -> S in position 3? But position 3 is E. 
  Positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:S, 4:T, 5:E -> but E is in position 5? But we know E cannot be in position 5 -> invalid.

  ""TIMES"" -> T,I,M,E,S -> M absent -> invalid.

  ""SITES"" -> S,I,T,E,S -> repeated S? And S in position 5? 
    If S is in position 5, we know it cannot be there -> invalid? 
    But we have S also in position 1? 
    ""SITES"": 
      Position 1: S -> S cannot be in position 5? It can be in 1? 
      Feedback from fetus was S in position 5: got ""-"", meaning S is not in position 5. So if we put S in position 1, that might be ok? 
      And E in position 4? But position 3 is not E? 
    Wait: the word is S-I-T-E-S -> position 3 is T, position 4 is E, position 5 is S.

    But E is in position 4 -> but we know E cannot be in position 4 (from model) -> invalid.

  ""BIKES"" -> B,I,K,E,S -> E in position 4 -> but E cannot be in position 4 -> invalid.

  ""YETIS"" -> Y,E,T,I,S -> E in position 2? But in the word ""YETIS"": positions: Y-1, E-2, T-3, I-4, S-5 -> but E cannot be in position 2? From fetus, we tried E in position 2 and got ""-"", meaning E is not in position 2? 
  And S cannot be in position 5? Guess ""yetiS"" has S in position 5 -> invalid because not allowed? 
  But also T is in position 3, which we know is not allowed? 

  We need to avoid:
    E in positions 2,4,5 -> so E can only be in 1 or 3.
    Similarly, T cannot be in position 3? Yes.

Therefore, for E in position 3, the word is: _ _ E _ _

Example: 
  ""  E  "" -> third letter E.

Let's think of ""STEPS"": S,T,E,P,S -> repeated S? And positions: S-1, T-2, E-3, P-4, S-5 -> but S in position 5 is bad? But S-5 is not allowed? 
But feedback for S was in position 5: ""-"", so S-5 is wrong, so we can't put S at 5, but this word puts S at 1 and 5? Position 1 S might be ok, but position 5 S is not allowed? Actually, the secret word might have S only once? We don't know.

But ""STEPS"": 
  We have S in position 1 and 5. Position 5 S is known to be wrong? So it will get a ""-"" again? But if the word has S only in position 1, then S at 5 is wrong and gets ""x""? 
  The feedback rules say: 
    If the letter is in the word but in wrong position: ""-"" 
    If not in word: ""x""
  But if the word has two S's, then it might be different? 

Since we know S is present, but if there is only one S, then in ""STEPS"" guessing S at position 5 when the word has S only at position 1, we'd get:
  Position 1 S: ✓ (if correct) 
  Position 5 S: x (if only one S and it's at 1)
But note: from guess 3 ""fetus"" with S in position 5, we got ""-"", meaning that S is present but not in position 5. So if the word has only one S, that S must be in a position other than 5, so position 5 in ""STEPS"" would get ""x"" if the S is only at position 1? Actually, the feedback system: 

  In ""fetus"", S was at position 5 and we got ""-"", meaning S is in the word but not at position 5. 
  So in a new guess, if we put S at position 5 again, we'd get ""-"" again? Only if there is another occurrence of S? But we don't know.

 To avoid confusion, we should not put S in position 5 because we know it's not there? Therefore, when guessing we should avoid positions we know are wrong for that letter? 

Specifically, for S: we know it's not in position 5, so we shouldn't put it there again? Similarly for E and T.

So for the new guess, we must:
  Put E in position 1 or 3? Not 2,4,5.
  Put S not in position 5.
  Put T not in position 3.

Now, for E in position 3: ""  E  ""

Then what words start with something, then something, then E, then something, then something? with T and S present.

Both T and S must appear in positions 1,2,4,5 for T? But T cannot be in 3? But position 3 is E, so ok.
For S: cannot be in 5? so positions 1,2,4.

Also, the other letters must be from available: B,G,H,I,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z.

And no absent letters.

Let me list candidate words:

  ""SWEET"" -> S,W,E,E,T -> repeated E? And W and T? 
    But E first occurrence in position 3? 
    Positions: S1, W2, E3, E4, T5 -> 
      S in position 1 -> ok (since not 5)
      W new
      E in position 3 -> ok
      E in position 4 -> we know E cannot be in position 4? Contradiction? 
      So if we guess ""sweet"", at position 4 we have E, which we know is not possible -> so the secret word cannot be ""SWEET""? Because E cannot be in position 4? 
      From guess 2, E was tried in position 4 and got ""-"", so position 4 is not E? So ""SWEET"" has E in position 4 -> it would be incorrect? 
      But the actual secret word has only one E? Or two? We don't know.

  If the secret word has two E's: then it is possible? But we only have one E confirmed? But it might be two.

  Let's assume there could be two E's? 

  But from feedback, we know E is present, but we don't know if it appears more than once? 

  However, the feedback we get for duplicate letters is tricky? 

  But in previous guesses, we have had distinct letters? 

  But let's not assume.

  To be safe, we must consider that there might be two E's, but we know E is not in positions 2,4,5? 

E positions:

  Cannot be in 2,4,5 -> position 4 is out? So E can only be in 1 or 3? Or if two E's, a second E could be in 1 or 3 as well? Only positions 1 and 3 are available for E.

So position 4 cannot have E? Therefore, ""SWEET"" would be invalid if the secret word has E in position 4? But we know E is not in position 4? So the secret word cannot have E in position 4? Therefore, if we guess ""sweet"", the position 4 E would get an ""x"" or ""-""? 

  If the secret word has only one E and it is in position 3, then:
    Position 4 E: not in the word? Because only one E? So ""x"".
  If the secret word has two E's, but where? Only positions 1 or 3 for the first one, but the second could be only in one of the other positions? But positions 2,4,5 are out for E, so only positions 1 and 3 can have E? So the second E would have to be in the one not used for the first.

For example, secret word with E at 1 and 3? 
  Position 1: E
  Position 3: E
  Then when we guess ""sweet"", position 1: S? so not E? -> so we'd have:
    Position 1: S -> not E? but if the secret has E in position 1, then S would be compared with E? 

I'm confusing myself.

Perhaps it's better to avoid this complication and guess a word with only one E? Since we haven't had any indication of two E's? 

We only know that E is present, it could be one or more? 

But to simplify, let's assume distinct letters for now? And if not, we'll find out later.

The safe approach is to guess a word with E only in position 1 or 3, and include T and S.

For E in position 3:

  _ _ E _ _

  Have T and S in positions 1,2,4,5 but T not in 3, S not in 5.

  So T in 1,2,4,5? Avoid 3 -> position 3 is taken by E.
  S in 1,2,4.

  So possible assignments:

  Option: put S in position 1, T in position 2? But T in position 2 is ok? 
  Then word: S T E _ _
  Now, the last two letters: must be two new letters from available.

  For example: S T E P ? -> not a 5-letter word? We need 5 letters: positions 1:S, 2:T, 3:E, 4:?, 5:?

  Position 4 and 5 must be two new letters.

  But the word would be ""STEEP""! But then E in position 4? -> not allowed? 
  ""STEEP"": S-T-E-E-P -> has E at position 4 -> bad.

  ""STREW"" -> S,T,R,E,W -> R is absent -> invalid.

  ""STYED"" -> S,T,Y,E,D -> D absent -> invalid.

  ""SPEWY"" -> not a word.

  How about ""STEEP"" is not good.

  Put S in position 4: _ _ E S _

  But then S in position 4? And we need T in 1,2,5? avoiding position 3? but position 3 is E.

  Example: let position 1 be T: T _ E S _ 
  Then positions 2 and 5 must be filled.

  Words: ""TIGES"" -> T,I,G,E,S -> E is in position 4? Not position 3. 
  ""T ** E S *"" is T?ES? not.

  ""T I E S S"" not a word.

  ""TUNES"" -> T,U,N,E,S -> U and N absent -> invalid.

  ""T K E S T"" not a word.

  ""SKEEP"" -> not a word.

  ""STEEK"" -> Scottish word? S not in position 4? S at 1, T at 2, E at 3, E at 4, K at 5 -> but E at 4 not allowed.

It's problematic.

Alternatively, put T in position 1? 

  T _ E _ _
  And S in position 2 or 4.

  If S in position 2: T S E _ _
  Then words: ""T  S  E  _   _"" 
  Example: "" T S E I S"" not valid. ""TSETSE"" -> too long? 
  ""TSETSE"" is 6 letters.

  "" T S E P  "" -> ""tsep""? not a word.

  S in position 4: T _ E S _
  Then we need to fill position 2 and 5.

  Words: ""TIES it's 4 letters? ""TIESS"" not valid.

  ""TWES the a word? 
  ""TWEAK"" -> T,W,E,A,K -> A absent -> invalid.

  ""TWERP"" -> T,W,E,R,P -> R absent -> invalid.

  ""THESP"" -> not a word.

Perhaps E in position 1.

We must try E in position 1.

So Case 1: E in position 1.

Then: E _ _ _ _

Must include T and S.

Constraints:
  S not in position 5 -> so S in 2,3,4.
  T not in position 3 -> so T in 2,4,5? Since position 1 is E.

Positions available: 2,3,4,5 for T and S and two other letters.

Example:
  Put T in position 2: E T _ _ _
  Then S in 3 or 4? Not 5? 
  If S in 3: E T S _ _ 
  If S in 4: E T _ S _ 

  Or put T in position 4: E _ _ T _
  Then S in 2 or 3: E S _ T _ or E _ S T _ 

  etc.

Let's try to find words:

  ""ETRUS"" not valid.
  ""ETC  "" too short.

  ""E  T  S  "" positions: E at 1, T at 5, S at 4? -> E _ _ S T -> but that's positions: 1:E, 2:?, 3:?, 4:S, 5:T
  S is in position 4 -> allowed? (since not 5)
  T is in position 5 -> no constraint on T being in position 5? Only that it cannot be in position 3? So position 5 is ok.

  So pattern: E _ _ S T

  Fill positions 2 and 3 with available letters.

  Available: B,G,H,I,J,K,P,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

  Examples: 
    ""E H S T"" not.
    ""EIGHTS"" -> not 5 letters.
    ""E T S T"" to ""ESTT"" not.

  ""E  something at 2, something at 3, S at 4, T at 5""

  ""E Q I S T"" -> ""equist"" not a word.

  ""E J S T"" not. 

  ""E G I S T"" -> ""egist"" not a common word? But ""egis"" is a word but 4 letters? Or ""egress"" is 6.

  ""ENTST"" not.

  ""EPIST"" -> epis is a prefix? ""epistle"" too long.

  ""EWEST"" -> not a word.

  ""EXIST"" -> E,X,I,S,T -> letters: E,X,I,S,T -> all distinct? 
  Positions: E-1, X-2, I-3, S-4, T-5 -> 
    S-4 -> not position 5? Allowed.
    T-5 -> allowed (no constraint on position 5 for T? Only not position 3)
  But we haven't tested X, I.

  And no absent letters? C,R,A,N,M,O,D,L,F,U are absent, but X and I are not used.

  ""EXIST"" is a valid word.

  Also, ""exist"" includes E at position 1, S at position 4 (not 5), T at position 5 (not 3).

  So it satisfies the constraints.

Similarly, are there other words? 

  ""EDIST"" -> D absent -> invalid.

  ""E G S T"" -> not a word.

  ""E W I S T"" -> ""ewist"" not a word? But ""twist"" not with E.

  ""EXIST"" seems good.

In guess 3, we got ""F(x) E(-) T(-) U(x) S(-)"" for ""fetus"", which means:

  E: present, but not in position 2? So in position 1 or 3.

  S: present, but not in position 5.

  T: present, but not in position 3.

""EXIST"" has:

  E in position 1: we don't know if it's correct or only present? but we'll see feedback.

  T in position 5: okay.

  S in position 4: okay.

  X and I are new.

So we can guess ""EXIST"". 

If the secret word has E in position 1, then we might get a ""✓"" for E? Or if E is in position 3, then position 1 might get a ""x"" or ""-""? We'll see.

But in this guess, we are testing Position 1 for E? Which is one of the two options.

Also, we are testing other letters.

So let's go with ""EXIST"".

But is it valid? Yes.

Another option: ""PIETY"" we considered earlier, but it doesn't include S.

We must include S.

Or ""piste"" but with the positions wrong.

So ""EXIST"" is a good choice.

Guess: EXIST

But we already used ""fetus"" with similar letters? Not exactly.

So output in the required format.After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: Eliminated C, R, A, N (✓: E at pos 5 is wrong, so E is present elsewhere).
- **Guess 2 (""model"")**: Eliminated M, O, D, L (✓: E at pos 4 is wrong).
- **Guess 3 (""fetus"")**: Eliminated F, U. Confirmed E (-), T (-), S (-), with constraints:
  - E is present but not in positions 2, 4, or 5 → must be in position 1 or 3.
  - T is present but not in position 3 → must be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
  - S is present but not in position 5 → must be in 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- Remaining letters must be from unused pool:  B, G, H, I, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

**Strategy for Guess 4**:
- Test E in position 1 (untested position) since position 3 may be harder to fit with T/S constraints.
- Prioritize high-frequency letters like I and S to maximize chances of hits.
- Avoid absent letters and wrong positions.
- **Chosen word: ""EXIST""**:
  - E in position 1 (tests E at untested pos 1).
  - S in position 4 (avoids pos 5, new position).
  - T in position 5 (avoids pos 3, new position).
  - Introduces new common letters I (position 3) and X (position 2).
  - Valid English word, efficient setup: if E is in pos 1, it gets ✓; else, rules out pos 1.",Guess 4: exist -> FEEDBACK: E(✓) X(✓) I(✓) S(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
