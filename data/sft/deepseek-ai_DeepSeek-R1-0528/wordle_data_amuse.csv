We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).
 The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and no repeated letters.
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one.

 However, I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning: the cumulative return on an investment over time) that is also used by some because it has common letters and is high scoring in terms of letter frequency.

 But let's stick with a more common one: ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

So, we know:
- The secret word ends with E.
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since it was in the second position in ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (because E is in the correct position at the end).
- Contains the letter A (but not in the second position).
- Does not contain C, R, or N.

Also, we should avoid repeating the letters we already know are absent (C, R, N) and the letter A that we know is present but not in position 2.

We have 5 more tries, so we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain A (but not in the second position). Also, we want to include other common consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Possible words:
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E. This ends with E, has A (in the third position, so not second). Also, it doesn't contain C, R, N. But note: we don't know if S, L, T are in the word. This would test three new letters.

However, we must consider that the A is already known to be in the word, but we don't know its position. In ""SLATE"", A is in the third position. Since in the first guess A was in the second position and was misplaced, it could be in the first, third, fourth, or fifth? But wait, the fifth is E and we know that's fixed. So A cannot be in the fifth. Also, it was not in the second, so it must be in the first, third, or fourth.

But note: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the second position. So we can try to put A in a different position.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A in the first position? But we don't know if that's correct. We want to test multiple possibilities.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the third or fourth position to see if it gets a check or a minus.

But also, we want to cover more letters. Since we have only one known letter (E at the end) and one known present letter (A), we need to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some words ending with E and containing A, without C, R, N.

Common words:
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> A is in position 3.
- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> similar to SLATE.
- ""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E -> A in position 3.
- ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A in position 3.

But note: we also have the letter E at the end, and we know it's correct. So we don't need to test E again? Actually, we can use it to form words.

Another idea: we can try to put A in the first position? For example:
- ""ABATE"": A, B, A, T, E -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we want to avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information.

But the word might have repeated letters? We don't know. So it's safer to use a word with distinct letters.

Let me think of words with A in the first position and ending with E, without C, R, N:
- ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E -> ends with E, A in first. But note: we don't know if I, K, L are in the word. Also, we avoid C, R, N.

But wait, we have the constraint that A is present and not in the second position. If we put A in the first, and if the secret word has A in the first, then we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know A is not in the first.

Similarly, we can try A in the third or fourth.

But we also want to test other common letters.

I think ""SLATE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, L, A, T. And A is in the third position, which is a new position.

Alternatively, we can try ""ADIEU"" but that doesn't end with E? We know the last letter is E, so we must have E at the end.

So, let's stick with words ending in E.

Another word: ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> but A is in the second position? We know that in the first guess, A was in the second position and it was misplaced. So if we put A in the second position again, it would be wrong again? But we don't know if the secret word has A in the second position? Actually, the feedback for A in the first guess was that it is in the word but not in the second position. So it cannot be in the second position. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the second position.

In ""SAUTE"", A is in the second position, so that would be a bad choice because we already know A is not in the second position.

So we must avoid putting A in the second position.

Therefore, in our next guess, we can put A in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now, let's consider:

Option 1: A in position 1: e.g., ""AGAPE"", ""ABASE"", ""ABATE"", ""ADAGE"", etc. But we want to avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use other letters.

But ""ABASE"": A, B, A, S, E -> has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, it uses B and S.

""ADAGE"": A, D, A, G, E -> again two A's.

""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> distinct letters. This is a good candidate.

Option 2: A in position 3: e.g., ""PLATE"", ""SLATE"", ""SHADE"", ""STAGE"", etc.

Option 3: A in position 4: e.g., ""LEAVE"", ""HEAVE"", ""WEAVE"", but note that these have E in the second position? We don't know about E in other positions. But we know the last letter is E, so position 5 is E.

""LEAVE"": L, E, A, V, E -> ends with E, but has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, E is in the second position? We don't know if that's correct.

But we know that E is in the word and in the last position. It might be in other positions too? We don't know.

We want to test new letters, so let's choose a word that has as many new common letters as possible and avoids the known absent letters (C, R, N) and avoids putting A in the second position.

I think ""SLATE"" is a solid choice because:
- It has S, L, T (common letters) and A (in position 3) and E (in position 5, which we know is correct).
- It doesn't contain C, R, N.

Alternatively, ""ALIVE"" is also good: A in position 1, and then L, I, V, E.

But note: we don't know if the first letter is A. If we use ""ALIVE"", we are testing A at the first position. If it gets a check, then we know the first letter is A. If it gets a minus, then we know A is not in the first position and must be in the third or fourth.

Similarly, with ""SLATE"", we are testing A in the third position.

Which one gives more information? Both are good. But ""SLATE"" tests three new consonants (S, L, T) while ""ALIVE"" tests L, I, V. S, L, T are more common than I and V? Actually, S and T are very common.

According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we already know R and N are absent, and A and E are present (E is fixed at the end). So we should test T, O, I, S, L, etc.

So ""SLATE"" has S, L, T, and A, E. We already know A and E, so we are testing S, L, T.

Similarly, ""TOWER"" but that has R? We know R is absent, so we cannot use R.

Another word: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E. This doesn't have A? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A? Actually, we don't have to include A in the next guess. We can leave it out to test other letters? But that might not be efficient because we know A is in the word and we need to find its position.

It's better to include A to get information about its position.

So we should include A and E (at the end) and three new letters.

Therefore, ""SLATE"" seems good.

But let me check if there's a word that includes more common letters and avoids the absent ones.

Another candidate: ""STALE"" -> S, T, A, L, E. Same as SLATE but with T and L swapped? Actually, in ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A is in the third position.

Or ""LEAST"" -> but that doesn't end with E? We need the last letter to be E.

So ""SLATE"" or ""STALE"" are both good.

I'll go with ""SLATE"".

So the next guess is ""SLATE"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (since E is confirmed in the 5th position).
- It must include A, but not in the 2nd position (since it was misplaced there in ""crane"").
- It should avoid C, R, and N (as they are absent).
- To maximize information, I'll prioritize common letters not yet tested (like S, L, T) and place A in a new position (e.g., 3rd) to test its location.

A good candidate is ""SLATE"":
- Ends with E.
- Places A in the 3rd position (new slot to test).
- Introduces new common letters: S, L, T.
- Avoids C, R, N and doesn't repeat misplaced positions for A.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).
 The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and no repeated letters.
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one.

 However, I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning: the cumulative return on an investment over time) that is also used by some because it has common letters and is high scoring in terms of letter frequency.

 But let's stick with a more common one: ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

So, we know:
- The secret word ends with E.
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since it was in the second position in ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (because E is in the correct position at the end).
- Contains the letter A (but not in the second position).
- Does not contain C, R, or N.

Also, we should avoid repeating the letters we already know are absent (C, R, N) and the letter A that we know is present but not in position 2.

We have 5 more tries, so we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain A (but not in the second position). Also, we want to include other common consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Possible words:
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E. This ends with E, has A (in the third position, so not second). Also, it doesn't contain C, R, N. But note: we don't know if S, L, T are in the word. This would test three new letters.

However, we must consider that the A is already known to be in the word, but we don't know its position. In ""SLATE"", A is in the third position. Since in the first guess A was in the second position and was misplaced, it could be in the first, third, fourth, or fifth? But wait, the fifth is E and we know that's fixed. So A cannot be in the fifth. Also, it was not in the second, so it must be in the first, third, or fourth.

But note: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the second position. So we can try to put A in a different position.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A in the first position? But we don't know if that's correct. We want to test multiple possibilities.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the third or fourth position to see if it gets a check or a minus.

But also, we want to cover more letters. Since we have only one known letter (E at the end) and one known present letter (A), we need to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some words ending with E and containing A, without C, R, N.

Common words:
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> A is in position 3.
- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> similar to SLATE.
- ""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E -> A in position 3.
- ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A in position 3.

But note: we also have the letter E at the end, and we know it's correct. So we don't need to test E again? Actually, we can use it to form words.

Another idea: we can try to put A in the first position? For example:
- ""ABATE"": A, B, A, T, E -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we want to avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information.

But the word might have repeated letters? We don't know. So it's safer to use a word with distinct letters.

Let me think of words with A in the first position and ending with E, without C, R, N:
- ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E -> ends with E, A in first. But note: we don't know if I, K, L are in the word. Also, we avoid C, R, N.

But wait, we have the constraint that A is present and not in the second position. If we put A in the first, and if the secret word has A in the first, then we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know A is not in the first.

Similarly, we can try A in the third or fourth.

But we also want to test other common letters.

I think ""SLATE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, L, A, T. And A is in the third position, which is a new position.

Alternatively, we can try ""ADIEU"" but that doesn't end with E? We know the last letter is E, so we must have E at the end.

So, let's stick with words ending in E.

Another word: ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> but A is in the second position? We know that in the first guess, A was in the second position and it was misplaced. So if we put A in the second position again, it would be wrong again? But we don't know if the secret word has A in the second position? Actually, the feedback for A in the first guess was that it is in the word but not in the second position. So it cannot be in the second position. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the second position.

In ""SAUTE"", A is in the second position, so that would be a bad choice because we already know A is not in the second position.

So we must avoid putting A in the second position.

Therefore, in our next guess, we can put A in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now, let's consider:

Option 1: A in position 1: e.g., ""AGAPE"", ""ABASE"", ""ABATE"", ""ADAGE"", etc. But we want to avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use other letters.

But ""ABASE"": A, B, A, S, E -> has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, it uses B and S.

""ADAGE"": A, D, A, G, E -> again two A's.

""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> distinct letters. This is a good candidate.

Option 2: A in position 3: e.g., ""PLATE"", ""SLATE"", ""SHADE"", ""STAGE"", etc.

Option 3: A in position 4: e.g., ""LEAVE"", ""HEAVE"", ""WEAVE"", but note that these have E in the second position? We don't know about E in other positions. But we know the last letter is E, so position 5 is E.

""LEAVE"": L, E, A, V, E -> ends with E, but has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, E is in the second position? We don't know if that's correct.

But we know that E is in the word and in the last position. It might be in other positions too? We don't know.

We want to test new letters, so let's choose a word that has as many new common letters as possible and avoids the known absent letters (C, R, N) and avoids putting A in the second position.

I think ""SLATE"" is a solid choice because:
- It has S, L, T (common letters) and A (in position 3) and E (in position 5, which we know is correct).
- It doesn't contain C, R, N.

Alternatively, ""ALIVE"" is also good: A in position 1, and then L, I, V, E.

But note: we don't know if the first letter is A. If we use ""ALIVE"", we are testing A at the first position. If it gets a check, then we know the first letter is A. If it gets a minus, then we know A is not in the first position and must be in the third or fourth.

Similarly, with ""SLATE"", we are testing A in the third position.

Which one gives more information? Both are good. But ""SLATE"" tests three new consonants (S, L, T) while ""ALIVE"" tests L, I, V. S, L, T are more common than I and V? Actually, S and T are very common.

According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we already know R and N are absent, and A and E are present (E is fixed at the end). So we should test T, O, I, S, L, etc.

So ""SLATE"" has S, L, T, and A, E. We already know A and E, so we are testing S, L, T.

Similarly, ""TOWER"" but that has R? We know R is absent, so we cannot use R.

Another word: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E. This doesn't have A? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A? Actually, we don't have to include A in the next guess. We can leave it out to test other letters? But that might not be efficient because we know A is in the word and we need to find its position.

It's better to include A to get information about its position.

So we should include A and E (at the end) and three new letters.

Therefore, ""SLATE"" seems good.

But let me check if there's a word that includes more common letters and avoids the absent ones.

Another candidate: ""STALE"" -> S, T, A, L, E. Same as SLATE but with T and L swapped? Actually, in ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A is in the third position.

Or ""LEAST"" -> but that doesn't end with E? We need the last letter to be E.

So ""SLATE"" or ""STALE"" are both good.

I'll go with ""SLATE"".

So the next guess is ""SLATE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (since E is confirmed in the 5th position).
- It must include A, but not in the 2nd position (since it was misplaced there in ""crane"").
- It should avoid C, R, and N (as they are absent).
- To maximize information, I'll prioritize common letters not yet tested (like S, L, T) and place A in a new position (e.g., 3rd) to test its location.

A good candidate is ""SLATE"":
- Ends with E.
- Places A in the 3rd position (new slot to test).
- Introduces new common letters: S, L, T.
- Avoids C, R, N and doesn't repeat misplaced positions for A.

We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, so last letter is E)

From Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3) – because we know A is in the word, and it was placed in position 3 here and got a minus, meaning it's not in position 3.
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, last letter E)

Now, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Given positions 5 is E, so A must be in position 1 or 4.
- S is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess).
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, L, T (from the x's).

Also, we have tested letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T.
Present: A, E, S (and E is fixed at the end).
Absent: C, R, N, L, T.

We have only 5 letters known to be absent, so the remaining alphabet (except these) could be present.

Now, we need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Includes A (in position 1 or 4, since it can't be 2 or 3 and 5 is E).
- Includes S (somewhere but not position 1).
- Avoids C, R, N, L, T.

Additionally, we need to test more letters to find the exact word.

Let's consider possible positions:
Since A can be in position 1 or 4, we should try to determine which one it is.

Also, S must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since not position 1 and position 5 is E).

We can try a word that puts A in position 1 and then tests S in another position, or put A in position 4 and test S elsewhere.

But we also want to introduce new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

List of common consonants not yet tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, and vowels: I, O, U (since we have A and E known).

We know E and A are present, and S is present. The secret word has 5 letters: positions 1 to 5, with 5 being E.

Possible cases:

Case 1: A at position 1.
Then the word is A ? ? ? E
And S is somewhere in positions 2,3,4 (since not 1 and not 5? Position 5 is E so S can't be at 5).

Case 2: A at position 4.
Then the word is ? ? ? A E
S must be in 2 or 3 (since not 1 and not 4? Wait, S can be in position 4? But if A is in position 4 then S can't be in position 4 unless they are the same? No. So if A is at 4, then S must be in 2 or 3? But we don't know if A and S are the same letter? But they are different. So S cannot be in position 4 if A is there. Therefore, S must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, to maximize information, we should try a word that tests both possibilities? But that might be tricky.

Alternatively, we can focus on one case and also test new letters.

Since we don't know which case (A at 1 or 4), we might choose a word that places A in position 4 to test that possibility? Or position 1?

If we assume A is in position 1, then we can try a word like ""ASKED"" – but we know D hasn't been tested, and it ends in D, not E? Must end with E.

So we need words ending with E and containing S and A, avoiding C,R,N,L,T.

Let's list possible words:

First, if A is in position 1: A _ _ _ E 
We know S must be in one of positions 2,3,4.

But we also need other letters.

Examples: 
- ""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> positions: A(1), B(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). 
But S is in position 4? That's allowed.

Check if it avoids absent letters: B,U,S,E – no C,R,N,L,T? L is absent? Yes, L is absent (from guess 2, L:x), so we cannot use L. But ""ABUSE"" has no L. It has B and U, which are new.

Other examples:
- ""AWAKE"": A, W, A, K, E – has double A? We don't know if that's allowed. But also K and W are new.
- ""APACE"": A, P, A, C, E – but C is absent? We cannot use C.

Well, no C.

""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E – S in position 4? And avoids bad letters.

Now, if A is in position 4: _ _ _ A E
Then the word must have S in position 2 or 3.

Examples:
- with S in position 2: ""? S ? A E"" -> e.g., ""USAGE"": U, S, A, G, E? But A is in position 3? Wait, not 4.

Let me correct: if the pattern is _ _ _ A E, then A is in position 4.

So: positions 1,2,3 are unknown, 4 is A, 5 is E.

And S must be in position 2 or 3.

For example:
- S in position 2: [letter] S [letter] A E -> e.g., ""ISSUE"": I, S, S, U, E? Not 5 letters? Wait, ""ISSUE"" is 5 letters: I,S,S,U,E. But has double S? And S is at position 2 and 3.
But we don't know if S appears twice.

Alternatively, ""PAUSE"": P, A, U, S, E? No, that would be A in position 2, but we know A cannot be in position 2.

For position 4: 
- ""HOUSE"": H, O, U, S, E? But S is in position 4? Then pattern: position 1:H, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E. But we are trying to put A in position 4? So actually, if we want A at position 4, then S cannot be at position 4. So it's confusing.

So, if the word has A at position 4, then S must be at position 2 or 3, so for position 2: ""WORD"" ?, e.g., ""BAS?E"" – but must end with E.

Pattern: [1] [2=S?] [3] [4=A] [5=E]

So: 1st letter unknown, 2nd S, 3rd unknown, then A, E.

Example: ""ASSAY"" doesn't end with E? ""ASSET"" but ends with T? We need E.

Hard: ""BASSE""? Not a common word.

""MASSE"" – but we don't know if M is available. ""MASSE"" ends with E, and has A? M,A,S,S,E? Positions: M(1), A(?), no, ""MASSE"": M,A,S,S,E? That's M(1),A(2),S(3),S(4),E(5). But A is in position 2, which we know it cannot be because from first guess A cannot be position 2.

So if we want S in position 2 and A in position 4, we need a word like [letter] S [letter] A E.

Examples: ""USAGE"" is U,S,A,G,E? But that has A in position 3? Not position 4.

I think I made a mistake. If A is in position 4 and S in position 2, then the word is [1] S [3] A E.

So [3] could be any letter, say X, then the word is ? S X A E.

Common words: 
- ""FUSEA"" – not a word? 
- ""MUSEA"" – plural of muse? Acceptable? But M might be okay.

But better common words: ""GUISE""? G,U,I,S,E – not A.

It's difficult to find common words with this pattern.

Instead, if S in position 3: pattern [1] [2] S [4=A] [5=E]

Then the word is ? ? S A E.

Examples: 
- ""PURSAE"" – not common.
- ""CAUSE"" has A at position 2? ""CAUSE"": C,A,U,S,E – A at position 2 is not allowed.

""HOUSE"": no A.

Perhaps ""PAWAE""? Not a word.

Common words are scarce. Better to consider ""ABUSE"" or ""AMUSE"" and other A-first words.

Given that, it might be more likely that A is in position 1? And the pattern is A _ _ _ E.

And S is in 2,3, or 4.

We can try ""ABUSE"": A(1), B(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). This places S in position 4.

This would test:
- A at position 1: if ✓, we know A is first letter.
- S at position 4: if ✓, we know S is fourth letter.

Also, introduces B and U (new letters).

But what if A is not at position 1? Then we get a minus for A, which would tell us that A must be at position 4 (the only remaining possibility). Similarly for S.

This seems efficient.

Another option: ""AMUSE"": A(1), M(2), U(3), S(4), E(5).

Same structure.

Or ""ADOBE"": but doesn't end with E? No.

I think ""ABUSE"" or ""AMUSE"" are good candidates.

But we must ensure the word is valid.

Also, we haven't used B, U, M, etc.

Let me choose ""ABUSE"". It has A at 1, S at 4, E at 5, and new letters B and U.

If the feedback shows:

- A is ✓ then A is at 1; if -, then A must be at 4.
- S is ✓ then S is at 4; if -, then S is elsewhere? But if A is not at 1, then S must be in position 2 or 3? But in this guess we placed S at position 4, so if S is not at 4, we get a minus and then we know S is in 2 or 3.

Additionally, B and U: if they get ✓ or -, we get info; if x, then they are not in the word.

Therefore, ""ABUSE"" seems like a solid guess.

But wait: is ""ABUSE"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

Therefore, I will go with ""ABUSE"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from both guesses:
- From ""crane"": E is confirmed in position 5 (✓), A is in the word but not in position 2 (-), and C, R, N are absent (x).
- From ""slate"": E is confirmed in position 5 (✓), S is in the word but not in position 1 (-), A is in the word but not in position 3 (-), and L, T are absent (x).

Key deductions:
- **E** is fixed at position 5.
- **A** must be in position 1 or 4 (since it cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5).
- **S** must be in position 2, 3, or 4 (as it cannot be in position 1 and position 5 is E).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L, T. Any new guess must exclude these.
- The goal is to test the position of A (1 vs. 4) and S while introducing new common letters.

For the next guess, I prioritize:
- Ending with **E**.
- Placing **A** in position 1 to test if it is correct (if not, A must be in position 4).
- Placing **S** in position 4 to test its location.
- Avoiding absent letters (C, R, N, L, T).
- Using new common letters like B and U to gather more information.

The word ""abuse"" fits perfectly:
- A (position 1): Tests if A is in position 1.
- B (position 2): New letter that hasn't been tested.
- U (position 3): New letter that hasn't been tested.
- S (position 4): Tests if S is in position 4.
- E (position 5): Confirmed ✓.

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities while covering key uncertainties.

<guess>abuse</guess>",abuse,"We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, so last letter is E)

From Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3) – because we know A is in the word, and it was placed in position 3 here and got a minus, meaning it's not in position 3.
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, last letter E)

Now, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Given positions 5 is E, so A must be in position 1 or 4.
- S is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess).
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, L, T (from the x's).

Also, we have tested letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T.
Present: A, E, S (and E is fixed at the end).
Absent: C, R, N, L, T.

We have only 5 letters known to be absent, so the remaining alphabet (except these) could be present.

Now, we need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Includes A (in position 1 or 4, since it can't be 2 or 3 and 5 is E).
- Includes S (somewhere but not position 1).
- Avoids C, R, N, L, T.

Additionally, we need to test more letters to find the exact word.

Let's consider possible positions:
Since A can be in position 1 or 4, we should try to determine which one it is.

Also, S must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since not position 1 and position 5 is E).

We can try a word that puts A in position 1 and then tests S in another position, or put A in position 4 and test S elsewhere.

But we also want to introduce new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

List of common consonants not yet tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, and vowels: I, O, U (since we have A and E known).

We know E and A are present, and S is present. The secret word has 5 letters: positions 1 to 5, with 5 being E.

Possible cases:

Case 1: A at position 1.
Then the word is A ? ? ? E
And S is somewhere in positions 2,3,4 (since not 1 and not 5? Position 5 is E so S can't be at 5).

Case 2: A at position 4.
Then the word is ? ? ? A E
S must be in 2 or 3 (since not 1 and not 4? Wait, S can be in position 4? But if A is in position 4 then S can't be in position 4 unless they are the same? No. So if A is at 4, then S must be in 2 or 3? But we don't know if A and S are the same letter? But they are different. So S cannot be in position 4 if A is there. Therefore, S must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, to maximize information, we should try a word that tests both possibilities? But that might be tricky.

Alternatively, we can focus on one case and also test new letters.

Since we don't know which case (A at 1 or 4), we might choose a word that places A in position 4 to test that possibility? Or position 1?

If we assume A is in position 1, then we can try a word like ""ASKED"" – but we know D hasn't been tested, and it ends in D, not E? Must end with E.

So we need words ending with E and containing S and A, avoiding C,R,N,L,T.

Let's list possible words:

First, if A is in position 1: A _ _ _ E 
We know S must be in one of positions 2,3,4.

But we also need other letters.

Examples: 
- ""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> positions: A(1), B(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). 
But S is in position 4? That's allowed.

Check if it avoids absent letters: B,U,S,E – no C,R,N,L,T? L is absent? Yes, L is absent (from guess 2, L:x), so we cannot use L. But ""ABUSE"" has no L. It has B and U, which are new.

Other examples:
- ""AWAKE"": A, W, A, K, E – has double A? We don't know if that's allowed. But also K and W are new.
- ""APACE"": A, P, A, C, E – but C is absent? We cannot use C.

Well, no C.

""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E – S in position 4? And avoids bad letters.

Now, if A is in position 4: _ _ _ A E
Then the word must have S in position 2 or 3.

Examples:
- with S in position 2: ""? S ? A E"" -> e.g., ""USAGE"": U, S, A, G, E? But A is in position 3? Wait, not 4.

Let me correct: if the pattern is _ _ _ A E, then A is in position 4.

So: positions 1,2,3 are unknown, 4 is A, 5 is E.

And S must be in position 2 or 3.

For example:
- S in position 2: [letter] S [letter] A E -> e.g., ""ISSUE"": I, S, S, U, E? Not 5 letters? Wait, ""ISSUE"" is 5 letters: I,S,S,U,E. But has double S? And S is at position 2 and 3.
But we don't know if S appears twice.

Alternatively, ""PAUSE"": P, A, U, S, E? No, that would be A in position 2, but we know A cannot be in position 2.

For position 4: 
- ""HOUSE"": H, O, U, S, E? But S is in position 4? Then pattern: position 1:H, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E. But we are trying to put A in position 4? So actually, if we want A at position 4, then S cannot be at position 4. So it's confusing.

So, if the word has A at position 4, then S must be at position 2 or 3, so for position 2: ""WORD"" ?, e.g., ""BAS?E"" – but must end with E.

Pattern: [1] [2=S?] [3] [4=A] [5=E]

So: 1st letter unknown, 2nd S, 3rd unknown, then A, E.

Example: ""ASSAY"" doesn't end with E? ""ASSET"" but ends with T? We need E.

Hard: ""BASSE""? Not a common word.

""MASSE"" – but we don't know if M is available. ""MASSE"" ends with E, and has A? M,A,S,S,E? Positions: M(1), A(?), no, ""MASSE"": M,A,S,S,E? That's M(1),A(2),S(3),S(4),E(5). But A is in position 2, which we know it cannot be because from first guess A cannot be position 2.

So if we want S in position 2 and A in position 4, we need a word like [letter] S [letter] A E.

Examples: ""USAGE"" is U,S,A,G,E? But that has A in position 3? Not position 4.

I think I made a mistake. If A is in position 4 and S in position 2, then the word is [1] S [3] A E.

So [3] could be any letter, say X, then the word is ? S X A E.

Common words: 
- ""FUSEA"" – not a word? 
- ""MUSEA"" – plural of muse? Acceptable? But M might be okay.

But better common words: ""GUISE""? G,U,I,S,E – not A.

It's difficult to find common words with this pattern.

Instead, if S in position 3: pattern [1] [2] S [4=A] [5=E]

Then the word is ? ? S A E.

Examples: 
- ""PURSAE"" – not common.
- ""CAUSE"" has A at position 2? ""CAUSE"": C,A,U,S,E – A at position 2 is not allowed.

""HOUSE"": no A.

Perhaps ""PAWAE""? Not a word.

Common words are scarce. Better to consider ""ABUSE"" or ""AMUSE"" and other A-first words.

Given that, it might be more likely that A is in position 1? And the pattern is A _ _ _ E.

And S is in 2,3, or 4.

We can try ""ABUSE"": A(1), B(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). This places S in position 4.

This would test:
- A at position 1: if ✓, we know A is first letter.
- S at position 4: if ✓, we know S is fourth letter.

Also, introduces B and U (new letters).

But what if A is not at position 1? Then we get a minus for A, which would tell us that A must be at position 4 (the only remaining possibility). Similarly for S.

This seems efficient.

- S is ✓ then S is at 4; if -, then S is elsewhere? But if A is not at 1, then S must be in position 2 or 3? But in this guess we placed S at position 4, so if S is not at 4, we get a minus and then we know S is in 2 or 3.

Additionally, B and U: if they get ✓ or -, we get info; if x, then they are not in the word.

Therefore, ""ABUSE"" seems like a solid guess.

But wait: is ""ABUSE"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

Therefore, I will go with ""ABUSE"".After analyzing the feedback from both guesses:
- From ""crane"": E is confirmed in position 5 (✓), A is in the word but not in position 2 (-), and C, R, N are absent (x).
- From ""slate"": E is confirmed in position 5 (✓), S is in the word but not in position 1 (-), A is in the word but not in position 3 (-), and L, T are absent (x).

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,amuse,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and ideally no repeated letters to maximize information.
 Common letters in English 5-letter words include vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N).
 The word ""CRANE"" is a popular starting word because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R) and no repeated letters.
 Alternatively, ""SLATE"" is also a good one.

 However, I recall that ""ROATE"" is a word (meaning: the cumulative return on an investment over time) that is also used by some because it has common letters and is high scoring in terms of letter frequency.

 But let's stick with a more common one: ""CRANE"".

 So, my first guess will be: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct position, so E is the last letter of the secret word)

So, we know:
- The secret word ends with E.
- The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since it was in the second position in ""crane"" and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
- The letters C, R, and N are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (because E is in the correct position at the end).
- Contains the letter A (but not in the second position).
- Does not contain C, R, or N.

Also, we should avoid repeating the letters we already know are absent (C, R, N) and the letter A that we know is present but not in position 2.

We have 5 more tries, so we want to test other common letters to get more information.

Let's think of words that end with E and contain A (but not in the second position). Also, we want to include other common consonants like S, T, L, etc.

Possible words:
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E. This ends with E, has A (in the third position, so not second). Also, it doesn't contain C, R, N. But note: we don't know if S, L, T are in the word. This would test three new letters.

However, we must consider that the A is already known to be in the word, but we don't know its position. In ""SLATE"", A is in the third position. Since in the first guess A was in the second position and was misplaced, it could be in the first, third, fourth, or fifth? But wait, the fifth is E and we know that's fixed. So A cannot be in the fifth. Also, it was not in the second, so it must be in the first, third, or fourth.

But note: the feedback for A was '-' meaning it's in the word but not in the second position. So we can try to put A in a different position.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A in the first position? But we don't know if that's correct. We want to test multiple possibilities.

Alternatively, we can try a word that has A in the third or fourth position to see if it gets a check or a minus.

But also, we want to cover more letters. Since we have only one known letter (E at the end) and one known present letter (A), we need to test as many new letters as possible.

Let me list some words ending with E and containing A, without C, R, N.

Common words:
- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> A is in position 3.
- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> similar to SLATE.
- ""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E -> A in position 3.
- ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A in position 3.

But note: we also have the letter E at the end, and we know it's correct. So we don't need to test E again? Actually, we can use it to form words.

Another idea: we can try to put A in the first position? For example:
- ""ABATE"": A, B, A, T, E -> but has two A's? We don't know if the word has two A's. Also, we want to avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information.

But the word might have repeated letters? We don't know. So it's safer to use a word with distinct letters.

Let me think of words with A in the first position and ending with E, without C, R, N:
- ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E -> ends with E, A in first. But note: we don't know if I, K, L are in the word. Also, we avoid C, R, N.

But wait, we have the constraint that A is present and not in the second position. If we put A in the first, and if the secret word has A in the first, then we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know A is not in the first.

Similarly, we can try A in the third or fourth.

But we also want to test other common letters.

I think ""SLATE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, L, A, T. And A is in the third position, which is a new position.

Alternatively, we can try ""ADIEU"" but that doesn't end with E? We know the last letter is E, so we must have E at the end.

So, let's stick with words ending in E.

Another word: ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> but A is in the second position? We know that in the first guess, A was in the second position and it was misplaced. So if we put A in the second position again, it would be wrong again? But we don't know if the secret word has A in the second position? Actually, the feedback for A in the first guess was that it is in the word but not in the second position. So it cannot be in the second position. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the second position.

In ""SAUTE"", A is in the second position, so that would be a bad choice because we already know A is not in the second position.

So we must avoid putting A in the second position.

Therefore, in our next guess, we can put A in position 1, 3, or 4.

Now, let's consider:

Option 1: A in position 1: e.g., ""AGAPE"", ""ABASE"", ""ABATE"", ""ADAGE"", etc. But we want to avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use other letters.

But ""ABASE"": A, B, A, S, E -> has two A's? And we don't know if the word has two A's. Also, it uses B and S.

""ADAGE"": A, D, A, G, E -> again two A's.

""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> distinct letters. This is a good candidate.

Option 2: A in position 3: e.g., ""PLATE"", ""SLATE"", ""SHADE"", ""STAGE"", etc.

Option 3: A in position 4: e.g., ""LEAVE"", ""HEAVE"", ""WEAVE"", but note that these have E in the second position? We don't know about E in other positions. But we know the last letter is E, so position 5 is E.

""LEAVE"": L, E, A, V, E -> ends with E, but has two E's? And we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, E is in the second position? We don't know if that's correct.

But we know that E is in the word and in the last position. It might be in other positions too? We don't know.

We want to test new letters, so let's choose a word that has as many new common letters as possible and avoids the known absent letters (C, R, N) and avoids putting A in the second position.

I think ""SLATE"" is a solid choice because:
- It has S, L, T (common letters) and A (in position 3) and E (in position 5, which we know is correct).
- It doesn't contain C, R, N.

Alternatively, ""ALIVE"" is also good: A in position 1, and then L, I, V, E.

But note: we don't know if the first letter is A. If we use ""ALIVE"", we are testing A at the first position. If it gets a check, then we know the first letter is A. If it gets a minus, then we know A is not in the first position and must be in the third or fourth.

Similarly, with ""SLATE"", we are testing A in the third position.

Which one gives more information? Both are good. But ""SLATE"" tests three new consonants (S, L, T) while ""ALIVE"" tests L, I, V. S, L, T are more common than I and V? Actually, S and T are very common.

According to letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we already know R and N are absent, and A and E are present (E is fixed at the end). So we should test T, O, I, S, L, etc.

So ""SLATE"" has S, L, T, and A, E. We already know A and E, so we are testing S, L, T.

Similarly, ""TOWER"" but that has R? We know R is absent, so we cannot use R.

Another word: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E. This doesn't have A? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A? Actually, we don't have to include A in the next guess. We can leave it out to test other letters? But that might not be efficient because we know A is in the word and we need to find its position.

It's better to include A to get information about its position.

So we should include A and E (at the end) and three new letters.

Therefore, ""SLATE"" seems good.

But let me check if there's a word that includes more common letters and avoids the absent ones.

Another candidate: ""STALE"" -> S, T, A, L, E. Same as SLATE but with T and L swapped? Actually, in ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A is in the third position.

Or ""LEAST"" -> but that doesn't end with E? We need the last letter to be E.

So ""SLATE"" or ""STALE"" are both good.

I'll go with ""SLATE"".

So the next guess is ""SLATE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).
- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.
- C, R, and N are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- The word must end with E (since E is confirmed in the 5th position).
- It must include A, but not in the 2nd position (since it was misplaced there in ""crane"").
- It should avoid C, R, and N (as they are absent).
- To maximize information, I'll prioritize common letters not yet tested (like S, L, T) and place A in a new position (e.g., 3rd) to test its location.

A good candidate is ""SLATE"":
- Ends with E.
- Places A in the 3rd position (new slot to test).
- Introduces new common letters: S, L, T.
- Avoids C, R, N and doesn't repeat misplaced positions for A.

<guess>slate</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

From Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, so last letter is E)

From Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: - (in the word, but not in position 1)
- L: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3) – because we know A is in the word, and it was placed in position 3 here and got a minus, meaning it's not in position 3.
- T: x (not in the word)
- E: ✓ (correct, last letter E)

Now, we know:
- The secret word ends with E (position 5).
- A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess). Given positions 5 is E, so A must be in position 1 or 4.
- S is in the word, but not in position 1 (from second guess).
- Letters not in the word: C, R, N, L, T (from the x's).

Also, we have tested letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, L, T.
Present: A, E, S (and E is fixed at the end).
Absent: C, R, N, L, T.

We have only 5 letters known to be absent, so the remaining alphabet (except these) could be present.

Now, we need to form a new 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5).
- Includes A (in position 1 or 4, since it can't be 2 or 3 and 5 is E).
- Includes S (somewhere but not position 1).
- Avoids C, R, N, L, T.

Additionally, we need to test more letters to find the exact word.

Let's consider possible positions:
Since A can be in position 1 or 4, we should try to determine which one it is.

Also, S must be in positions 2, 3, or 4 (since not position 1 and position 5 is E).

We can try a word that puts A in position 1 and then tests S in another position, or put A in position 4 and test S elsewhere.

But we also want to introduce new common letters to narrow down possibilities.

List of common consonants not yet tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, and vowels: I, O, U (since we have A and E known).

We know E and A are present, and S is present. The secret word has 5 letters: positions 1 to 5, with 5 being E.

Possible cases:

Case 1: A at position 1.
Then the word is A ? ? ? E
And S is somewhere in positions 2,3,4 (since not 1 and not 5? Position 5 is E so S can't be at 5).

Case 2: A at position 4.
Then the word is ? ? ? A E
S must be in 2 or 3 (since not 1 and not 4? Wait, S can be in position 4? But if A is in position 4 then S can't be in position 4 unless they are the same? No. So if A is at 4, then S must be in 2 or 3? But we don't know if A and S are the same letter? But they are different. So S cannot be in position 4 if A is there. Therefore, S must be in position 2 or 3.

Also, to maximize information, we should try a word that tests both possibilities? But that might be tricky.

Alternatively, we can focus on one case and also test new letters.

Since we don't know which case (A at 1 or 4), we might choose a word that places A in position 4 to test that possibility? Or position 1?

If we assume A is in position 1, then we can try a word like ""ASKED"" – but we know D hasn't been tested, and it ends in D, not E? Must end with E.

So we need words ending with E and containing S and A, avoiding C,R,N,L,T.

Let's list possible words:

First, if A is in position 1: A _ _ _ E 
We know S must be in one of positions 2,3,4.

But we also need other letters.

Examples: 
- ""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> positions: A(1), B(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). 
But S is in position 4? That's allowed.

Check if it avoids absent letters: B,U,S,E – no C,R,N,L,T? L is absent? Yes, L is absent (from guess 2, L:x), so we cannot use L. But ""ABUSE"" has no L. It has B and U, which are new.

Other examples:
- ""AWAKE"": A, W, A, K, E – has double A? We don't know if that's allowed. But also K and W are new.
- ""APACE"": A, P, A, C, E – but C is absent? We cannot use C.

Well, no C.

""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E – S in position 4? And avoids bad letters.

Now, if A is in position 4: _ _ _ A E
Then the word must have S in position 2 or 3.

Examples:
- with S in position 2: ""? S ? A E"" -> e.g., ""USAGE"": U, S, A, G, E? But A is in position 3? Wait, not 4.

Let me correct: if the pattern is _ _ _ A E, then A is in position 4.

So: positions 1,2,3 are unknown, 4 is A, 5 is E.

And S must be in position 2 or 3.

For example:
- S in position 2: [letter] S [letter] A E -> e.g., ""ISSUE"": I, S, S, U, E? Not 5 letters? Wait, ""ISSUE"" is 5 letters: I,S,S,U,E. But has double S? And S is at position 2 and 3.
But we don't know if S appears twice.

Alternatively, ""PAUSE"": P, A, U, S, E? No, that would be A in position 2, but we know A cannot be in position 2.

For position 4: 
- ""HOUSE"": H, O, U, S, E? But S is in position 4? Then pattern: position 1:H, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E. But we are trying to put A in position 4? So actually, if we want A at position 4, then S cannot be at position 4. So it's confusing.

So, if the word has A at position 4, then S must be at position 2 or 3, so for position 2: ""WORD"" ?, e.g., ""BAS?E"" – but must end with E.

Pattern: [1] [2=S?] [3] [4=A] [5=E]

So: 1st letter unknown, 2nd S, 3rd unknown, then A, E.

Example: ""ASSAY"" doesn't end with E? ""ASSET"" but ends with T? We need E.

Hard: ""BASSE""? Not a common word.

""MASSE"" – but we don't know if M is available. ""MASSE"" ends with E, and has A? M,A,S,S,E? Positions: M(1), A(?), no, ""MASSE"": M,A,S,S,E? That's M(1),A(2),S(3),S(4),E(5). But A is in position 2, which we know it cannot be because from first guess A cannot be position 2.

So if we want S in position 2 and A in position 4, we need a word like [letter] S [letter] A E.

Examples: ""USAGE"" is U,S,A,G,E? But that has A in position 3? Not position 4.

I think I made a mistake. If A is in position 4 and S in position 2, then the word is [1] S [3] A E.

So [3] could be any letter, say X, then the word is ? S X A E.

Common words: 
- ""FUSEA"" – not a word? 
- ""MUSEA"" – plural of muse? Acceptable? But M might be okay.

But better common words: ""GUISE""? G,U,I,S,E – not A.

It's difficult to find common words with this pattern.

Instead, if S in position 3: pattern [1] [2] S [4=A] [5=E]

Then the word is ? ? S A E.

Examples: 
- ""PURSAE"" – not common.
- ""CAUSE"" has A at position 2? ""CAUSE"": C,A,U,S,E – A at position 2 is not allowed.

""HOUSE"": no A.

Perhaps ""PAWAE""? Not a word.

Common words are scarce. Better to consider ""ABUSE"" or ""AMUSE"" and other A-first words.

Given that, it might be more likely that A is in position 1? And the pattern is A _ _ _ E.

And S is in 2,3, or 4.

We can try ""ABUSE"": A(1), B(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). This places S in position 4.

This would test:
- A at position 1: if ✓, we know A is first letter.
- S at position 4: if ✓, we know S is fourth letter.

Also, introduces B and U (new letters).

But what if A is not at position 1? Then we get a minus for A, which would tell us that A must be at position 4 (the only remaining possibility). Similarly for S.

This seems efficient.

Another option: ""AMUSE"": A(1), M(2), U(3), S(4), E(5).

Same structure.

Or ""ADOBE"": but doesn't end with E? No.

I think ""ABUSE"" or ""AMUSE"" are good candidates.

But we must ensure the word is valid.

Also, we haven't used B, U, M, etc.

Let me choose ""ABUSE"". It has A at 1, S at 4, E at 5, and new letters B and U.

If the feedback shows:

- A is ✓ then A is at 1; if -, then A must be at 4.
- S is ✓ then S is at 4; if -, then S is elsewhere? But if A is not at 1, then S must be in position 2 or 3? But in this guess we placed S at position 4, so if S is not at 4, we get a minus and then we know S is in 2 or 3.

Additionally, B and U: if they get ✓ or -, we get info; if x, then they are not in the word.

Therefore, ""ABUSE"" seems like a solid guess.

But wait: is ""ABUSE"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.

Therefore, I will go with ""ABUSE"".After analyzing the feedback from both guesses:
- From ""crane"": E is confirmed in position 5 (✓), A is in the word but not in position 2 (-), and C, R, N are absent (x).
- From ""slate"": E is confirmed in position 5 (✓), S is in the word but not in position 1 (-), A is in the word but not in position 3 (-), and L, T are absent (x).

Key deductions:
- **E** is fixed at position 5.
- **A** must be in position 1 or 4 (since it cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5).
- **S** must be in position 2, 3, or 4 (as it cannot be in position 1 and position 5 is E).
- Absent letters: C, R, N, L, T. Any new guess must exclude these.
- The goal is to test the position of A (1 vs. 4) and S while introducing new common letters.

For the next guess, I prioritize:
- Ending with **E**.
- Placing **A** in position 1 to test if it is correct (if not, A must be in position 4).
- Placing **S** in position 4 to test its location.
- Avoiding absent letters (C, R, N, L, T).
- Using new common letters like B and U to gather more information.

The word ""abuse"" fits perfectly:
- A (position 1): Tests if A is in position 1.
- B (position 2): New letter that hasn't been tested.
- U (position 3): New letter that hasn't been tested.
- S (position 4): Tests if S is in position 4.
- E (position 5): Confirmed ✓.

This guess efficiently narrows possibilities while covering key uncertainties.

This would test three new letters.\n\nHowever, we must consider that the A is already known to be in the word, but we don\'t know its position. In ""SLATE"", A is in the third position. Since in the first guess A was in the second position and was misplaced, it could be in the first, third, fourth, or fifth? But wait, the fifth is E and we know that\'s fixed. So A cannot be in the fifth. Also, it was not in the second, so it must be in the first, third, or fourth.\n\nBut note: the feedback for A was \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not in the second position.

We want to test multiple possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that has A in the third or fourth position to see if it gets a check or a minus.\n\nBut also, we want to cover more letters. Since we have only one known letter (E at the end) and one known present letter (A), we need to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet me list some words ending with E and containing A, without C, R, N.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""SLATE"": S, L, A, T, E -> A is in position 3.\n- ""PLATE"": P, L, A, T, E -> similar to SLATE.\n- ""SHADE"": S, H, A, D, E -> A in position 3.\n- ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A in position 3.\n\nBut note: we also have the letter E at the end, and we know it\'s correct. So we don\'t need to test E again? Actually, we can use it to form words.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to put A in the first position? For example:\n- ""ABATE"": A, B, A, T, E -> but has two A\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, we want to avoid repeating letters if possible to get more information.\n\nBut the word might have repeated letters? We don\'t know. So it\'s safer to use a word with distinct letters.\n\nLet me think of words with A in the first position and ending with E, without C, R, N:\n- ""ALIKE"": A, L, I, K, E -> ends with E, A in first. But note: we don\'t know if I, K, L are in the word. Also, we avoid C, R, N.\n\nBut wait, we have the constraint that A is present and not in the second position. If we put A in the first, and if the secret word has A in the first, then we get a check. If not, we get a minus and then we know A is not in the first.\n\nSimilarly, we can try A in the third or fourth.\n\nBut we also want to test other common letters.\n\nI think ""SLATE"" is a good candidate because it tests S, L, A, T. And A is in the third position, which is a new position.\n\nAlternatively, we can try ""ADIEU"" but that doesn\'t end with E? We know the last letter is E, so we must have E at the end.\n\nSo, let\'s stick with words ending in E.\n\nAnother word: ""SAUTE"": S, A, U, T, E -> but A is in the second position? We know that in the first guess, A was in the second position and it was misplaced. So if we put A in the second position again, it would be wrong again? But we don\'t know if the secret word has A in the second position? Actually, the feedback for A in the first guess was that it is in the word but not in the second position. So it cannot be in the second position. Therefore, we should avoid putting A in the second position.\n\nIn ""SAUTE"", A is in the second position, so that would be a bad choice because we already know A is not in the second position.\n\nSo we must avoid putting A in the second position.\n\nTherefore, in our next guess, we can put A in position 1, 3, or 4.\n\nNow, let\'s consider:\n\nOption 1: A in position 1: e.g., ""AGAPE"", ""ABASE"", ""ABATE"", ""ADAGE"", etc. But we want to avoid using letters we know are absent? We know C, R, N are absent. So we can use other letters.\n\nBut ""ABASE"": A, B, A, S, E -> has two A\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. Also, it uses B and S.\n\n""ADAGE"": A, D, A, G, E -> again two A\'s.\n\n""ALIVE"": A, L, I, V, E -> distinct letters. This is a good candidate.\n\nOption 2: A in position 3: e.g., ""PLATE"", ""SLATE"", ""SHADE"", ""STAGE"", etc.\n\nOption 3: A in position 4: e.g., ""LEAVE"", ""HEAVE"", ""WEAVE"", but note that these have E in the second position? We don\'t know about E in other positions. But we know the last letter is E, so position 5 is E.\n\n""LEAVE"": L, E, A, V, E -> ends with E, but has two E\'s? And we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, E is in the second position? We don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\nBut we know that E is in the word and in the last position. It might be in other positions too? We don\'t know.\n\nWe want to test new letters, so let\'s choose a word that has as many new common letters as possible and avoids the known absent letters (C, R, N) and avoids putting A in the second position.\n\nI think ""SLATE"" is a solid choice because:\n- It has S, L, T (common letters) and A (in position 3) and E (in position 5, which we know is correct).\n- It doesn\'t contain C, R, N.\n\nAlternatively, ""ALIVE"" is also good: A in position 1, and then L, I, V, E.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the first letter is A. If we use ""ALIVE"", we are testing A at the first position. If it gets a check, then we know the first letter is A. If it gets a minus, then we know A is not in the first position and must be in the third or fourth.\n\nSimilarly, with ""SLATE"", we are testing A in the third position.\n\nWhich one gives more information? Both are good. But ""SLATE"" tests three new consonants (S, L, T) while ""ALIVE"" tests L, I, V. S, L, T are more common than I and V? Actually, S and T are very common.\n\nAccording to letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. But we already know R and N are absent, and A and E are present (E is fixed at the end). So we should test T, O, I, S, L, etc.\n\nSo ""SLATE"" has S, L, T, and A, E. We already know A and E, so we are testing S, L, T.\n\nSimilarly, ""TOWER"" but that has R? We know R is absent, so we cannot use R.\n\nAnother word: ""SPITE"" -> S, P, I, T, E. This doesn\'t have A? But we know A is in the word, so we must include A? Actually, we don\'t have to include A in the next guess. We can leave it out to test other letters? But that might not be efficient because we know A is in the word and we need to find its position.\n\nIt\'s better to include A to get information about its position.\n\nSo we should include A and E (at the end) and three new letters.\n\nTherefore, ""SLATE"" seems good.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word that includes more common letters and avoids the absent ones.\n\nAnother candidate: ""STALE"" -> S, T, A, L, E. Same as SLATE but with T and L swapped? Actually, in ""STALE"": S, T, A, L, E -> A is in the third position.\n\nOr ""LEAST"" -> but that doesn\'t end with E? We need the last letter to be E.\n\nSo ""SLATE"" or ""STALE"" are both good.\n\nI\'ll go with ""SLATE"".\n\nSo the next guess is ""SLATE"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th letter).\n- A is in the word but not in the 2nd position.\n- C, R, and N are not in the word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- The word must end with E (since E is confirmed in the 5th position).\n- It must include A, but not in the 2nd position (since it was misplaced there in ""crane"").\n- It should avoid C, R, and N (as they are absent).\n- To maximize information, I\'ll prioritize common letters not yet tested (like S, L, T) and place A in a new position (e.g., 3rd) to test its location.\n\nA good candidate is ""SLATE"":\n- Ends with E.\n- Places A in the 3rd position (new slot to test).\n- Introduces new common letters: S, L, T.\n- Avoids C, R, N and doesn\'t repeat misplaced positions for A.\n\n<guess>slate</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 2)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct, so last letter is E)\n\nFrom Guess 2: ""slate""\n- S: - (in the word, but not in position 1)\n- L: x (not in the word)\n- A: - (in the word, but not in position 3) – because we know A is in the word, and it was placed in position 3 here and got a minus, meaning it\'s not in position 3.\n- T: x (not in the word)\n- E: ✓ (correct, last letter E)\n\nNow, we know:\n- The secret word ends with E (position 5).\n- A is in the word, but not in position 2 (from first guess) and not in position 3 (from second guess).

No. So if A is at 4, then S must be in 2 or 3? But we don\'t know if A and S are the same letter? But they are different. So S cannot be in position 4 if A is there. Therefore, S must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nAlso, to maximize information, we should try a word that tests both possibilities? But that might be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, we can focus on one case and also test new letters.\n\nSince we don\'t know which case (A at 1 or 4), we might choose a word that places A in position 4 to test that possibility? Or position 1?\n\nIf we assume A is in position 1, then we can try a word like ""ASKED"" – but we know D hasn\'t been tested, and it ends in D, not E? Must end with E.\n\nSo we need words ending with E and containing S and A, avoiding C,R,N,L,T.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\nFirst, if A is in position 1: A _ _ _ E \nWe know S must be in one of positions 2,3,4.\n\nBut we also need other letters.\n\nExamples: \n- ""ABUSE"": A, B, U, S, E -> positions: A(1), B(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). \nBut S is in position 4? That\'s allowed.\n\nCheck if it avoids absent letters: B,U,S,E – no C,R,N,L,T? L is absent? Yes, L is absent (from guess 2, L:x), so we cannot use L. But ""ABUSE"" has no L. It has B and U, which are new.\n\nOther examples:\n- ""AWAKE"": A, W, A, K, E – has double A? We don\'t know if that\'s allowed. But also K and W are new.\n- ""APACE"": A, P, A, C, E – but C is absent? We cannot use C.\n\nWell, no C.\n\n""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E – S in position 4? And avoids bad letters.\n\nNow, if A is in position 4: _ _ _ A E\nThen the word must have S in position 2 or 3.\n\nExamples:\n- with S in position 2: ""? S ? A E"" -> e.g., ""USAGE"": U, S, A, G, E? But A is in position 3? Wait, not 4.\n\nLet me correct: if the pattern is _ _ _ A E, then A is in position 4.\n\nSo: positions 1,2,3 are unknown, 4 is A, 5 is E.\n\nAnd S must be in position 2 or 3.\n\nFor example:\n- S in position 2: [letter] S [letter] A E -> e.g., ""ISSUE"": I, S, S, U, E? Not 5 letters? Wait, ""ISSUE"" is 5 letters: I,S,S,U,E. But has double S? And S is at position 2 and 3.\nBut we don\'t know if S appears twice.\n\nAlternatively, ""PAUSE"": P, A, U, S, E? No, that would be A in position 2, but we know A cannot be in position 2.\n\nFor position 4: \n- ""HOUSE"": H, O, U, S, E? But S is in position 4? Then pattern: position 1:H, 2:O, 3:U, 4:S, 5:E. But we are trying to put A in position 4? So actually, if we want A at position 4, then S cannot be at position 4. So it\'s confusing.\n\nSo, if the word has A at position 4, then S must be at position 2 or 3, so for position 2: ""WORD"" ?, e.g., ""BAS?E"" – but must end with E.\n\nPattern: [1] [2=S?] [3] [4=A] [5=E]\n\nSo: 1st letter unknown, 2nd S, 3rd unknown, then A, E.\n\nExample: ""ASSAY"" doesn\'t end with E? ""ASSET"" but ends with T? We need E.\n\nHard: ""BASSE""? Not a common word.\n\n""MASSE"" – but we don\'t know if M is available. ""MASSE"" ends with E, and has A? M,A,S,S,E? Positions: M(1), A(?), no, ""MASSE"": M,A,S,S,E? That\'s M(1),A(2),S(3),S(4),E(5). But A is in position 2, which we know it cannot be because from first guess A cannot be position 2.\n\nSo if we want S in position 2 and A in position 4, we need a word like [letter] S [letter] A E.\n\nExamples: ""USAGE"" is U,S,A,G,E? But that has A in position 3? Not position 4.\n\nI think I made a mistake. If A is in position 4 and S in position 2, then the word is [1] S [3] A E.\n\nSo [3] could be any letter, say X, then the word is ? S X A E.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""FUSEA"" – not a word? \n- ""MUSEA"" – plural of muse? Acceptable? But M might be okay.\n\nBut better common words: ""GUISE""? G,U,I,S,E – not A.\n\nIt\'s difficult to find common words with this pattern.\n\nInstead, if S in position 3: pattern [1] [2] S [4=A] [5=E]\n\nThen the word is ? ? S A E.\n\nExamples: \n- ""PURSAE"" – not common.\n- ""CAUSE"" has A at position 2? ""CAUSE"": C,A,U,S,E – A at position 2 is not allowed.\n\n""HOUSE"": no A.\n\nPerhaps ""PAWAE""? Not a word.\n\nCommon words are scarce. Better to consider ""ABUSE"" or ""AMUSE"" and other A-first words.\n\nGiven that, it might be more likely that A is in position 1? And the pattern is A _ _ _ E.\n\nAnd S is in 2,3, or 4.\n\nWe can try ""ABUSE"": A(1), B(2), U(3), S(4), E(5). This places S in position 4.\n\nThis would test:\n- A at position 1: if ✓, we know A is first letter.\n- S at position 4: if ✓, we know S is fourth letter.\n\nAlso, introduces B and U (new letters).\n\nBut what if A is not at position 1? Then we get a minus for A, which would tell us that A must be at position 4 (the only remaining possibility). Similarly for S.\n\nThis seems efficient.\n\nAnother option: ""AMUSE"": A(1), M(2), U(3), S(4), E(5).\n\nSame structure.\n\nOr ""ADOBE"": but doesn\'t end with E? No.\n\nI think ""ABUSE"" or ""AMUSE"" are good candidates.\n\nBut we must ensure the word is valid.\n\nAlso, we haven\'t used B, U, M, etc.\n\nLet me choose ""ABUSE"". It has A at 1, S at 4, E at 5, and new letters B and U.\n\nIf the feedback shows:\n\n- A is ✓ then A is at 1; if -, then A must be at 4.\n- S is ✓ then S is at 4; if -, then S is elsewhere? But if A is not at 1, then S must be in position 2 or 3? But in this guess we placed S at position 4, so if S is not at 4, we get a minus and then we know S is in 2 or 3.\n\nAdditionally, B and U: if they get ✓ or -, we get info; if x, then they are not in the word.\n\nTherefore, ""ABUSE"" seems like a solid guess.\n\nBut wait: is ""ABUSE"" a valid 5-letter word? Yes.\n\nTherefore, I will go with ""ABUSE"".After analyzing the feedback from both guesses:\n- From ""crane"": E is confirmed in position 5 (✓), A is in the word but not in position 2 (-), and C, R, N are absent (x).\n- From ""slate"": E is confirmed in position 5 (✓), S is in the word but not in position 1 (-), A is in the word but not in position 3 (-), and L, T are absent (x).\n\nKey deductions:\n- **E** is fixed at position 5.\n- **A** must be in position 1 or 4 (since it cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5).\n- **S** must be in position 2, 3, or 4 (as it cannot be in position 1 and position 5 is E).\n- Absent letters: C, R, N, L, T. Any new guess must exclude these.\n- The goal is to test the position of A (1 vs. 4) and S while introducing new common letters.\n\nFor the next guess, I prioritize:\n- Ending with **E**.\n- Placing **A** in position 1 to test if it is correct (if not, A must be in position 4).\n- Placing **S** in position 4 to test its location.\n- Avoiding absent letters (C, R, N, L, T).\n- Using new common letters like B and U to gather more information.\n\nThe word ""abuse"" fits perfectly:\n- A (position 1): Tests if A is in position 1.\n- B (position 2): New letter that hasn\'t been tested.\n- U (position 3): New letter that hasn\'t been tested.\n- S (position 4): Tests if S is in position 4.\n- E (position 5): Confirmed ✓.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows possibilities while covering key uncertainties.\n\n<guess>abuse</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: slate -> FEEDBACK: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)\nGuess 3: abuse -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) B(x) U(✓) S(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present but wrong position, specifically not pos 2)
- N: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct position, pos 5)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: - (present but not pos 1)
- L: x (absent)
- A: - (present but wrong position, specifically not pos 3) 
- T: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (pos 5)

Guess 3: ""abuse""
- A: ✓ (correct position, so pos 1)
- B: x (absent)
- U: ✓ (correct position, so pos 3)
- S: ✓ (correct position, so pos 4)
- E: ✓ (pos 5)

Now, putting all together:

Correct positions:
- Position 1: A (from abuse, A:✓)
- Position 3: U (from abuse, U:✓)
- Position 4: S (from abuse, S:✓)
- Position 5: E

Now the secret word is: A _ U S E

We only need to find the letter in position 2.

Also, from feedback, we know:
Absent letters: C, R, N, L, T, B (from the x's in each guess)

Additionally, we have information about the letter in position 2:

- From ""crane"": the A was in pos 2 and we know it was wrong (because it got - meaning misplaced), but since A is not in the word at pos 2? Actually, we now know A is at pos 1, so the letter at pos 2 is not A.

But more importantly, the letter we put in pos 2 in ""crane"" was R and it was absent (x). Then in ""slate"", we had L (absent) and in ""abuse"" we had B (absent). So we have tested R, L, B at pos 2 and they are absent.

Moreover, we know from the presence of S and A in other words but only in correct positions now.

Now, the secret word: A _ U S E

The unknown letter must be:
- Not any absent letter: so not C, R, N, L, T, B.

Also, we haven't tested many letters. Since we know four letters, and one missing, we need to consider what letters can go in position 2.

Moreover, from ""crane"", we had A in pos 2? Actually, ""crane"" had A in pos 2? ""crane"" is C R A N E, so positions: C(1), R(2), A(3)? Wait I think I miscounted:

In the beginning, I assumed:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)

So for crane: 
- Position 1: C (x absent)
- Position 2: R (x absent)
- Position 3: A (- present but wrong position)
- Position 4: N (x absent)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Then slate: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓) -> 
- Pos1: S (- present but wrong pos)
- Pos2: L (x absent)
- Pos3: A (- present but wrong pos for this guess)
- Pos4: T (x absent)
- Pos5: E (✓)

And abuse: A(✓) B(x) U(✓) S(✓) E(✓) -> 
- Pos1: A ✓
- Pos2: B x
- Pos3: U ✓
- Pos4: S ✓
- Pos5: E ✓

Now, for the secret word: since A is at pos1 (confirmed in abuse), U at pos3, S at pos4, E at pos5.

Therefore, position 2 is the only missing letter.

Now, we know:
- The letter in position 2 cannot be any of the absent letters: C, R, N (from guess1), L, T (from guess2), B (from guess3). Also, A is at pos1, so it can't be A? But we know it's a different letter.

Moreover, from the feedback in guess1 and guess2, but specifically:

In guess1, position 3 was A, which we know now is actually not in the word at position 3? Wait, no: we have A at pos1, so in guess1, A was in pos3 and it had a minus because it was misplaced; since the correct position is pos1, it makes sense.

Similarly, S in guess2 was at pos1? In guess2, S was at pos1 and got minus because the correct position for S is pos4? Yes.

Now, what about the unknown letter? Position 2 has not been guessed correctly, but we know:

- It must not be absent: so not C, R, N, L, T, B.

- It must be a letter that has not been used elsewhere? We have used A, U, S, E in the word, but it could be a repeated letter? We don't know yet.

But we need to consider that. The secret word might have duplicate letters? As of now, the known letters are A, U, S, E and one unknown.

From absence, we rule out C,R,N,L,T,B.

Also, we have not tested other common letters, so we should consider any letter from the alphabet except the absent ones.

Let me list available letters: All letters except absent: C,R,N,L,T,B and present: A,U,S,E. But A,U,S,E are already in the word, so for position 2, it could be a new letter or one of these if they can be duplicated? For example, the word might have double S? But S is at position 4, so if position 2 is S, then it would be S at multiple positions. But we don't know.

But let's see from past feedback:

In guess2, ""slate"" had S at pos1, L at pos2, A at pos3, T at pos4, E at pos5. We got S minus, meaning S is in the word but not at pos1. Now we know S is at pos4.

Similarly, there were no other minuses for S that would suggest it appears twice? Similarly for A.

In fact, in guess1: A was at pos3 and we got minus, meaning it appears once (probably) at another position? But since we now know it's at pos1.

Similarly, S in guess2 at pos1 got minus because it is at pos4.

Now, for position 2: it hasn't been directly filled with any letter that we know is absent or present with feedback.

However, in guess3, we placed B at position 2 and it was absent (x).

So position 2 is not B.

Similarly, in guess1, position 2 was R (x absent), in guess2, position 2 was L (x absent).

So we know position 2 can't be R, L, or B.

What about other possibilities? We need to find a 5-letter English word that starts with A, has U at pos3, S at pos4, E at pos5, and a letter at pos2 that is not C,R,N,L,T,B and not excluded elsewhere.

Now, since we have four letters fixed, we can list possible words.

Possible words: A X U S E, where X is a letter (consonant or vowel) not in the absent list.

Absent list: C, R, N, L, T, B.

Also, the word must be valid.

Common English words that fit:

- ""AWAKE"": but this is A,W,A,K,E? Pos1:A, pos2:W, pos3:A? But we have U at pos3? No, it must be A ? U S E, so pos3 must be U.

So A and then some letter, then U, S, E.

Words with A? U S E: 

- ""ABUSE"": but we guessed that already, and it's not the secret because only one letter correct? No, we guessed ""abuse"" and got A,U,S,E all correct except B was absent. But the secret word is not ""abuse"" because when we guessed it, only B was wrong? Actually, the feedback: A,U,S,E correct, B absent. So the secret word is almost ""abuse"" but without B? So it must be A ? U S E, where ? is a letter that is not B.

Some possibilities:

- ""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E -> but we haven't tested M.
- ""ADUSE"" — not a word?
- ""AGUSE"" — not a word?
- ""APAUSE"" — not 5 letters?

Common words:
- ""AMUSE""
- ""ARUSE"" — not a word?
- ""AWAKE"" doesn't fit because pos3 is A, not U.

Perhaps ""CAUSE"" but C is absent? and it starts with C? No.

Other: ""HOUSE"" — doesn't start with A.

So ""AMUSE"" seems a candidate: A, M, U, S, E.

Another: ""EXUSE"" not.

Or ""PAUSE"", which is P,A,U,S,E? But doesn't start with A? Pos1 is P? No.

So ""AMUSE"" is likely? Or ""ABIDE"" but ends with DE? Must end with SE? No.

Another one: ""AIRES""? But ends with ES, not SE? And pos4 is E? No.

Perhaps ""AISLE"": A,I,S,L,E? But L is absent? And positions: pos3 is S? No, we need pos3 U.

Specifically: must have U at pos3 and S at pos4.

So: A ? U S E

Possible:
- ""AMUSE"" : A, M, U, S, E
- ""ADIEU"" but ends with U? Must have E at end.

Perhaps ""AUGUE""? Not common.

Or ""ARGUE"": A,R,G,U,E? But R is absent? And positions: if ARGUE, then pos1:A, pos2:R, pos3:G? But we need U at pos3? No, pos3 must be U? In ""abuse"" we have U at pos3.

So the word is fixed as A ? U S E.

So ""AMUSE"" is one: A M U S E

Another: ""AZURE"": A Z U R E? But R is absent? And Z might be okay.

But ""AZURE"": has U? Yes. But ""AZURE"": positions A(1), Z(2), U(3), R(4), E(5). But pos4 is R? We need S at pos4? So not.

Similarly, ""HAUSE"" not starts with A.

So ""AMUSE"" seems the only common word? What about ""APTLY""? Doesn't end with SE.

Perhaps ""AQUSE""? Not a word.

Or ""AVOID""? Doesn't fit.

Therefore, ""AMUSE"" is a strong candidate.

Moreover, in ""AMUSE"", M has not been tested before. Since we haven't tested M, it could be present.

Also, in the feedback from previous guesses, M was not used, so no direct negative.

Thus, the secret word might be ""amuse"".

But we have one more thing: in guess1, we had A at position 3 and got minus. Now that we have A at pos1, it makes sense.

Similarly, in guess2, we had A at position 3 again? Guess2 was ""slate"": positions S,L,A,T,E. A was at pos3? And got minus because it was misplaced? Now, knowing A is at pos1, it's correctly identified not to be at pos3.

Also, with S at pos4.

Therefore, the word should be ""amuse"".

But let me double-check: 
Secret word: ? But we don't know, but based on deductions.

We have 3 tries left? But if we guess ""amuse"", we might win.

But to confirm: if we guess ""amuse"" and it is correct, then good.

Possibly other words: e.g., ""issue"" but starts with I, not A.

So I think ""amuse"" is the most likely.

Therefore, the next guess is ""amuse"".

In the context, since we have only position 2 missing and we know many absent letters, we can safely guess ""amuse"".

The step:

- Fixed: pos1=A, pos3=U, pos4=S, pos5=E
- Missing: pos2=? Must be one letter not absent, and forming a valid word.
- ""amuse"" fits: A M U S E

If it were ""abuse"", but B is absent, so no.

Other possibilities: ""AUNE""? Not word.

Therefore, I will guess ""amuse"".

Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)**  
   - E is in position 5 and correct.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - C, R, N are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: slate → Feedback: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)**  
   - E is confirmed in position 5.  
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - L and T are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: abuse → Feedback: A(✓) B(x) U(✓) S(✓) E(✓)**  
   - A is in position 1 and correct.  
   - U is in position 3 and correct.  
   - S is in position 4 and correct.  
   - E is confirmed in position 5.  
   - B is absent.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Fixed Letters**:  
  - Position 1: A  
  - Position 3: U  
  - Position 4: S  
  - Position 5: E  
- **Secret Word Pattern**: A _ U S E (where ""_"" is the missing letter in position 2).  
- **Absent Letters**: Based on ""x"" feedback: C, R, N, L, T, B. Any new guess must avoid these.  
- **Unknown Position**: Position 2 must be filled with a letter not yet excluded (not A, U, S, E due to fixed positions, and not the absent list).  
- **Possible Letters for Position 2**: All letters except absent ones or fixed duplicates. Common untested letters include D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, etc.  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Fill position 2 with a letter that completes a valid 5-letter English word, testing the most likely candidates based on common vocabulary.  
- **Pattern Matches**: The word must match A _ U S E. Common English words fitting this pattern:  
  - ""amuse"" (A M U S E)  
  - ""avulse"" (too long—6 letters, invalid)  
  - ""azure"" (A Z U R E—but R is absent) → invalid.  
- ""AMUSE"" is a valid word:  
  - Position 2: M (not absent in previous feedback, so it must be tested).  
  - If correct, it solves the game; if not, it provides new information (e.g., if M is absent or misplaced).  
- **Why ""AMUSE""?**  
  - Tests M—a common consonant not yet evaluated.  
  - Confirms the only plausible common word meeting the pattern and avoiding absent letters.  
  - Remaining attempts permit this high-confidence guess (only position 2 unknown).  
- If ""amuse"" is incorrect (e.g., M gets ""x""), the next guesses could test alternatives like D, G, or P, but ""amuse"" is optimal for efficiency.  

<guess>amuse</guess>",amuse,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (absent)
- R: x (absent)
- A: - (present but wrong position, specifically not pos 2)
- N: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (correct position, pos 5)

Guess 2: ""slate""
- S: - (present but not pos 1)
- L: x (absent)
- A: - (present but wrong position, specifically not pos 3) 
- T: x (absent)
- E: ✓ (pos 5)

- A: ✓ (correct position, so pos 1)
- B: x (absent)
- U: ✓ (correct position, so pos 3)
- S: ✓ (correct position, so pos 4)
- E: ✓ (pos 5)

Now, putting all together:

Correct positions:
- Position 1: A (from abuse, A:✓)
- Position 3: U (from abuse, U:✓)
- Position 4: S (from abuse, S:✓)
- Position 5: E

Now the secret word is: A _ U S E

We only need to find the letter in position 2.

Also, from feedback, we know:
Absent letters: C, R, N, L, T, B (from the x's in each guess)

Additionally, we have information about the letter in position 2:

- From ""crane"": the A was in pos 2 and we know it was wrong (because it got - meaning misplaced), but since A is not in the word at pos 2? Actually, we now know A is at pos 1, so the letter at pos 2 is not A.

But more importantly, the letter we put in pos 2 in ""crane"" was R and it was absent (x). Then in ""slate"", we had L (absent) and in ""abuse"" we had B (absent). So we have tested R, L, B at pos 2 and they are absent.

Moreover, we know from the presence of S and A in other words but only in correct positions now.

Now, the secret word: A _ U S E

The unknown letter must be:
- Not any absent letter: so not C, R, N, L, T, B.

Also, we haven't tested many letters. Since we know four letters, and one missing, we need to consider what letters can go in position 2.

Moreover, from ""crane"", we had A in pos 2? Actually, ""crane"" had A in pos 2? ""crane"" is C R A N E, so positions: C(1), R(2), A(3)? Wait I think I miscounted:

In the beginning, I assumed:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)

So for crane: 
- Position 1: C (x absent)
- Position 2: R (x absent)
- Position 3: A (- present but wrong position)
- Position 4: N (x absent)
- Position 5: E (✓)

Then slate: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓) -> 
- Pos1: S (- present but wrong pos)
- Pos2: L (x absent)
- Pos3: A (- present but wrong pos for this guess)
- Pos4: T (x absent)
- Pos5: E (✓)

And abuse: A(✓) B(x) U(✓) S(✓) E(✓) -> 
- Pos1: A ✓
- Pos2: B x
- Pos3: U ✓
- Pos4: S ✓
- Pos5: E ✓

Now, for the secret word: since A is at pos1 (confirmed in abuse), U at pos3, S at pos4, E at pos5.

Therefore, position 2 is the only missing letter.

Now, we know:
- The letter in position 2 cannot be any of the absent letters: C, R, N (from guess1), L, T (from guess2), B (from guess3). Also, A is at pos1, so it can't be A? But we know it's a different letter.

Moreover, from the feedback in guess1 and guess2, but specifically:

In guess1, position 3 was A, which we know now is actually not in the word at position 3? Wait, no: we have A at pos1, so in guess1, A was in pos3 and it had a minus because it was misplaced; since the correct position is pos1, it makes sense.

Similarly, S in guess2 was at pos1? In guess2, S was at pos1 and got minus because the correct position for S is pos4? Yes.

Now, what about the unknown letter? Position 2 has not been guessed correctly, but we know:

- It must not be absent: so not C, R, N, L, T, B.

- It must be a letter that has not been used elsewhere? We have used A, U, S, E in the word, but it could be a repeated letter? We don't know yet.

But we need to consider that. The secret word might have duplicate letters? As of now, the known letters are A, U, S, E and one unknown.

From absence, we rule out C,R,N,L,T,B.

Also, we have not tested other common letters, so we should consider any letter from the alphabet except the absent ones.

Let me list available letters: All letters except absent: C,R,N,L,T,B and present: A,U,S,E. But A,U,S,E are already in the word, so for position 2, it could be a new letter or one of these if they can be duplicated? For example, the word might have double S? But S is at position 4, so if position 2 is S, then it would be S at multiple positions. But we don't know.

But let's see from past feedback:

In guess2, ""slate"" had S at pos1, L at pos2, A at pos3, T at pos4, E at pos5. We got S minus, meaning S is in the word but not at pos1. Now we know S is at pos4.

Similarly, there were no other minuses for S that would suggest it appears twice? Similarly for A.

In fact, in guess1: A was at pos3 and we got minus, meaning it appears once (probably) at another position? But since we now know it's at pos1.

Similarly, S in guess2 at pos1 got minus because it is at pos4.

Now, for position 2: it hasn't been directly filled with any letter that we know is absent or present with feedback.

However, in guess3, we placed B at position 2 and it was absent (x).

So position 2 is not B.

Similarly, in guess1, position 2 was R (x absent), in guess2, position 2 was L (x absent).

So we know position 2 can't be R, L, or B.

What about other possibilities? We need to find a 5-letter English word that starts with A, has U at pos3, S at pos4, E at pos5, and a letter at pos2 that is not C,R,N,L,T,B and not excluded elsewhere.

Now, since we have four letters fixed, we can list possible words.

Possible words: A X U S E, where X is a letter (consonant or vowel) not in the absent list.

Absent list: C, R, N, L, T, B.

Also, the word must be valid.

Common English words that fit:

- ""AWAKE"": but this is A,W,A,K,E? Pos1:A, pos2:W, pos3:A? But we have U at pos3? No, it must be A ? U S E, so pos3 must be U.

So A and then some letter, then U, S, E.

Words with A? U S E: 

- ""ABUSE"": but we guessed that already, and it's not the secret because only one letter correct? No, we guessed ""abuse"" and got A,U,S,E all correct except B was absent. But the secret word is not ""abuse"" because when we guessed it, only B was wrong? Actually, the feedback: A,U,S,E correct, B absent. So the secret word is almost ""abuse"" but without B? So it must be A ? U S E, where ? is a letter that is not B.

Some possibilities:

- ""AMUSE"": A, M, U, S, E -> but we haven't tested M.
- ""ADUSE"" — not a word?
- ""AGUSE"" — not a word?
- ""APAUSE"" — not 5 letters?

Common words:
- ""AMUSE""
- ""ARUSE"" — not a word?
- ""AWAKE"" doesn't fit because pos3 is A, not U.

Perhaps ""CAUSE"" but C is absent? and it starts with C? No.

Other: ""HOUSE"" — doesn't start with A.

So ""AMUSE"" seems a candidate: A, M, U, S, E.

Another: ""EXUSE"" not.

Or ""PAUSE"", which is P,A,U,S,E? But doesn't start with A? Pos1 is P? No.

So ""AMUSE"" is likely? Or ""ABIDE"" but ends with DE? Must end with SE? No.

Another one: ""AIRES""? But ends with ES, not SE? And pos4 is E? No.

Perhaps ""AISLE"": A,I,S,L,E? But L is absent? And positions: pos3 is S? No, we need pos3 U.

Specifically: must have U at pos3 and S at pos4.

So: A ? U S E

Possible:
- ""AMUSE"" : A, M, U, S, E
- ""ADIEU"" but ends with U? Must have E at end.

Perhaps ""AUGUE""? Not common.

Or ""ARGUE"": A,R,G,U,E? But R is absent? And positions: if ARGUE, then pos1:A, pos2:R, pos3:G? But we need U at pos3? No, pos3 must be U? In ""abuse"" we have U at pos3.

So the word is fixed as A ? U S E.

So ""AMUSE"" is one: A M U S E

Another: ""AZURE"": A Z U R E? But R is absent? And Z might be okay.

But ""AZURE"": has U? Yes. But ""AZURE"": positions A(1), Z(2), U(3), R(4), E(5). But pos4 is R? We need S at pos4? So not.

Similarly, ""HAUSE"" not starts with A.

So ""AMUSE"" seems the only common word? What about ""APTLY""? Doesn't end with SE.

Perhaps ""AQUSE""? Not a word.

Or ""AVOID""? Doesn't fit.

Therefore, ""AMUSE"" is a strong candidate.

Moreover, in ""AMUSE"", M has not been tested before. Since we haven't tested M, it could be present.

Also, in the feedback from previous guesses, M was not used, so no direct negative.

Thus, the secret word might be ""amuse"".

But we have one more thing: in guess1, we had A at position 3 and got minus. Now that we have A at pos1, it makes sense.

Similarly, in guess2, we had A at position 3 again? Guess2 was ""slate"": positions S,L,A,T,E. A was at pos3? And got minus because it was misplaced? Now, knowing A is at pos1, it's correctly identified not to be at pos3.

Also, with S at pos4.

Therefore, the word should be ""amuse"".

But let me double-check: 
Secret word: ? But we don't know, but based on deductions.

We have 3 tries left? But if we guess ""amuse"", we might win.

But to confirm: if we guess ""amuse"" and it is correct, then good.

Possibly other words: e.g., ""issue"" but starts with I, not A.

So I think ""amuse"" is the most likely.

Therefore, the next guess is ""amuse"".

In the context, since we have only position 2 missing and we know many absent letters, we can safely guess ""amuse"".

The step:

- Fixed: pos1=A, pos3=U, pos4=S, pos5=E
- Missing: pos2=? Must be one letter not absent, and forming a valid word.
- ""amuse"" fits: A M U S E

If it were ""abuse"", but B is absent, so no.

Other possibilities: ""AUNE""? Not word.

Therefore, I will guess ""amuse"".Based on the feedback from all previous guesses:

1. **Guess 1: crane → Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(✓)**  
   - E is in position 5 and correct.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.  
   - C, R, N are absent.  

2. **Guess 2: slate → Feedback: S(-) L(x) A(-) T(x) E(✓)**  
   - E is confirmed in position 5.  
   - S is in the word but not in position 1.  
   - A is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - L and T are absent.  

3. **Guess 3: abuse → Feedback: A(✓) B(x) U(✓) S(✓) E(✓)**  
   - A is in position 1 and correct.  
   - U is in position 3 and correct.  
   - S is in position 4 and correct.  
   - E is confirmed in position 5.  
   - B is absent.  

### Key Deductions:
- **Fixed Letters**:  
  - Position 1: A  
  - Position 3: U  
  - Position 4: S  
  - Position 5: E  
- **Secret Word Pattern**: A _ U S E (where ""_"" is the missing letter in position 2).  
- **Absent Letters**: Based on ""x"" feedback: C, R, N, L, T, B. Any new guess must avoid these.  
- **Unknown Position**: Position 2 must be filled with a letter not yet excluded (not A, U, S, E due to fixed positions, and not the absent list).  
- **Possible Letters for Position 2**: All letters except absent ones or fixed duplicates. Common untested letters include D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W, Y, Z, etc.  

### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Fill position 2 with a letter that completes a valid 5-letter English word, testing the most likely candidates based on common vocabulary.  
- **Pattern Matches**: The word must match A _ U S E. Common English words fitting this pattern:  
  - ""amuse"" (A M U S E)  
  - ""avulse"" (too long—6 letters, invalid)  
  - ""azure"" (A Z U R E—but R is absent) → invalid.  
- ""AMUSE"" is a valid word:  
  - Position 2: M (not absent in previous feedback, so it must be tested).  
  - If correct, it solves the game; if not, it provides new information (e.g., if M is absent or misplaced).  
- **Why ""AMUSE""?**  
  - Tests M—a common consonant not yet evaluated.  
  - Confirms the only plausible common word meeting the pattern and avoiding absent letters.  
  - Remaining attempts permit this high-confidence guess (only position 2 unknown).  
- If ""amuse"" is incorrect (e.g., M gets ""x""), the next guesses could test alternatives like D, G, or P, but ""amuse"" is optimal for efficiency.",Guess 4: amuse -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(✓) U(✓) S(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
