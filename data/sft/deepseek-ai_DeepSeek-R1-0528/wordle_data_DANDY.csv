We are starting a new game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a strong starting word.
 A good starting word often has:
   - 5 different letters to maximize information.
   - Common letters to increase the chance of hitting some in the secret word.
 Examples of such words: ""CRANE"", ""SALET"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, my first guess is CRANE.
</think>
<thinking>
I'm starting a new game with no prior guesses or feedback. For an optimal first guess in Wordle, I should use a word that:
- Contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information
- Avoids repeated letters
- Has letters that frequently appear in English words

""CRANE"" is an excellent starting word because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N)
- Uses five distinct letters
- Covers frequently used letters like R, A, and E
- Has been statistically proven effective in Wordle strategies

This first guess will help establish which letters are present/absent and potentially reveal correct positions, setting up stronger subsequent guesses.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were in (position 3 and 4 respectively in ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and N (since they are present in the word)
- Does not include C, R, or E (since they are absent)
- Places A and N in positions different from the first guess (i.e., A cannot be in the 3rd position, N cannot be in the 4th position)

Additionally, we want to maximize information by:
- Using other common letters that haven't been tested yet (like T, O, I, S, L, etc.)
- Avoiding letters we already know are absent (C, R, E)

Let's think of words that contain A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible letters to use: We have 3 more letters to choose (since A and N are fixed). We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels: O, I, U (but we already have A, so maybe one more vowel?).

We also note that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4.

Let's try to form a word that has A and N, and also includes T, O, S, or other common letters.

Some candidate words:
- ""PLANT"": 
  - Contains A and N (and also P, L, T)
  - But note: in ""PLANT"", A is in position 3? Actually: 
      P L A N T -> A is in position 3, but in the first guess ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and we know it's not in that position. So we cannot put A in position 3 again. Therefore, ""PLANT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

- ""PAINT"": 
  - P A I N T -> A is in position 2, N is in position 4. 
  - But in the first guess, N was in position 4 and we know it's not in position 4. So we cannot put N in position 4. Therefore, ""PAINT"" is invalid.

- ""SAINT"": 
  - S A I N T -> A in position 2, N in position 4 -> again, N in position 4 is not allowed.

We need to avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

Let's try to put A in a new position and N in a new position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (since not 3)
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (since not 4)

Another candidate: ""MANGO"" -> but we cannot use E? Actually, we can only avoid C, R, E. But ""MANGO"" has O and G. However, we must avoid E? It doesn't have E. But wait, we are avoiding C, R, E. So ""MANGO"" is okay? But let's check positions:
  M A N G O -> A is in position 2 (okay, not 3), N is in position 3 (okay, not 4). 
But we also have to consider that the word must be valid. However, note that the feedback for the first guess said A and N are present, so we must include them.

But wait: ""MANGO"" has the letter O and G, which we haven't tested. However, we are allowed to use any letters except C, R, E.

But is ""MANGO"" a valid word? Yes.

But we can do better: we want to test more common letters. Also, we have two new letters: M and G and O. That's three new letters. But we might want to test more frequent letters.

Another candidate: ""STAND""
  S T A N D -> 
    A is in position 3? -> but we cannot put A in position 3. So invalid.

""TALON"": 
  T A L O N -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  Letters: T, A, L, O, N -> includes A and N, and new letters T, L, O. 
  Avoids C, R, E.

But note: we have two positions for A and N that are acceptable.

Another candidate: ""ALONG""
  A L O N G -> 
    A in position 1 (okay), N in position 4 -> but we cannot put N in position 4 (because in CRANE it was in 4 and was wrong). So invalid.

""ADMIN"": 
  A D M I N -> 
    A in position 1 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  Letters: A, D, M, I, N -> new letters D, M, I.

But we might prefer more common letters.

""DAUNT"": 
  D A U N T -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 4 -> not allowed (position 4 for N is invalid).

""NASTY"": 
  N A S T Y -> 
    N in position 1 (okay), A in position 2 (okay). 
  But note: we have to be cautious because we are putting N at the start and A at position 2. 
  This word uses S, T, Y as new letters.

This seems acceptable.

But let's check: 
  In ""NASTY"": 
    N is in position 1 (which is new, since previously N was in 4 and now we are trying 1)
    A is in position 2 (previously was in 3, now 2 is new)

So ""NASTY"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" we already saw is invalid because of N in 4.

""OCTAN"" -> but O is allowed? Yes, but it has C? C is not allowed (we know C is absent). So invalid.

""LANTS"" -> not a common word? Actually, we need a valid English word. ""LANT"" is not common, but ""SLANT"" is.

""SLANT"": 
  S L A N T -> 
    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because in CRANE, A was in 3 and it was wrong position, so it cannot be in 3 again). 
  So invalid.

""TAKEN"" -> but E is not allowed? We know E is absent, so we cannot use E. So invalid.

""TANGO"": 
  T A N G O -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 3 (okay). 
  This uses T, G, O.

But note: we are putting N in position 3, which is new (previously it was in 4). So that's acceptable.

However, we have two candidates: ""NASTY"" and ""TANGO"". 

We want to maximize information. In ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1 and A at position 2, and also S, T, Y. In ""TANGO"", we are testing T, A, N, G, O.

We also note that we have two letters we know are in the word (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions and also discover other letters.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated, such as S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

But we must avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.

Let me try to list words that have A and N, without C, R, E, and with A not in 3 and N not in 4.

- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> A in 2 (okay), but no N? We must include N. So invalid.

- ""PAINS"": P A I N S -> A in 2 (okay), N in 4 -> not allowed.

- ""MAINS"": same issue, N in 4.

- ""SAUNA"": S A U N A -> A in 2 and 5, N in 4 -> N in 4 is not allowed.

- ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses B, J, O.

But J is not very common. We might get less information.

- ""WAGON"": W A G O N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses W, G, O.

- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses H, D, Y.

- ""PANSY"": P A N S Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses P, S, Y.

""PANSY"" seems good: 
  Positions: 
    P (1), A (2), N (3), S (4), Y (5)
  A is in 2 (new, not 3) -> okay
  N is in 3 (new, not 4) -> okay
  We are testing P, S, Y which are common.

But note: we are putting N in position 3. Is that acceptable? Yes, because the feedback only said that N is not in position 4, but it could be in 3.

Similarly, A is in 2, which is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""NADIR"": but R is not allowed? We know R is absent. So invalid.

""LATIN"": L A T I N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses L, T, I.

But we don't have the letter S? We might want to test S because it's very common.

We have to choose one.

I think ""PANSY"" is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (P, S, Y) and places A and N in new positions.

Alternatively, ""NASTY"" is also good: 
  N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. 
  This tests N at the start (which we haven't tried) and A in 2, and also S, T, Y.

But note: in ""NASTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and N in position 1. We know that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4. So positions 1 and 2 for N and A are both new.

However, we are using two positions that we haven't tested for A and N. 

But we have to be cautious: if we put both A and N in new positions, we might get more information about their correct positions.

But also, we are testing three new letters: S, T, Y.

Similarly, ""PANSY"" tests P, S, Y and puts A in 2 and N in 3.

I think both are reasonable. But let me see which one covers more common letters.

The frequency of letters in English words (for 5-letter words) might help. Common letters: S, T, L, N (but we already know N), A (we know A), then P, O, I, etc.

S and T are very common. So both ""NASTY"" and ""PANSY"" have S and T? Actually, ""PANSY"" has S and Y, but not T. ""NASTY"" has S, T, and Y.

So ""NASTY"" tests T as well, which is more common than P.

Therefore, I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.

But wait: in ""NASTY"", we are putting N in position 1. We don't know if that is correct. Similarly, A in position 2. But that's the point: we are testing these positions.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put A and N in adjacent positions to get more positional information.

But I think ""NASTY"" is a solid choice.

Another candidate: ""STAIN"" -> 
  S T A I N -> 
    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.

""SATIN"": 
  S A T I N -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  This uses S, T, I.

But note: we are putting A in 2 and N in 5. This is acceptable.

And we are testing S, T, I.

But we are not testing Y? That's okay. We can test Y later.

""SATIN"" is also a good candidate because it uses very common letters.

But we already know that A and N are in the word, so we are focusing on finding their positions and discovering other letters.

Between ""NASTY"" and ""SATIN"", which one?

""NASTY"": tests N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.
""SATIN"": tests S in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, N in 5.

We know that A is not in 3, so in ""SATIN"", T is in 3 and that's a new letter in that position. Also, we are testing I.

But note: we have no information about I, so it's good to test.

However, in ""NASTY"", we are testing Y which is less common than I? Actually, I is more common.

But we are also testing T in both. 

I think ""SATIN"" might be better because it uses I (a common vowel) and avoids putting two known letters (A and N) in the first two positions, which might be less likely? Not necessarily.

But let's consider: we have two known letters (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions. In ""SATIN"", we are putting A in 2 and N in 5, which are two different positions. In ""NASTY"", we are putting both at the front.

We might get more information if we spread them out.

But I don't have a strong preference.

Another candidate: ""POINT"" -> but we must include A and N? We cannot leave out A or N because we know they are in the word. So we must include both.

Therefore, we must choose a word that contains both A and N.

After considering, I think ""SATIN"" is a good choice because:
- It uses common letters: S, A, T, I, N.
- It places A in position 2 (which is new) and N in position 5 (which is new, since previously N was in 4).
- It tests the vowel I, which is common.

Alternatively, ""TAINT"" -> but T is repeated? We want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information. ""TAINT"" has two T's. So not ideal.

""SAINT"" is invalid because N is in 4.

So I'll go with ""SATIN"".

But let me confirm: 
  S A T I N
  A is in position 2 (which is not 3, so okay)
  N is in position 5 (which is not 4, so okay)

And the word is valid.

We are testing S, T, I, and we already know A and N are present.

So we can get information about S, T, I and the positions of A and N.

Therefore, I choose ""SATIN"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are absent from the secret word.
- A and N are present but not in positions 3 or 4 (as indicated by the ""-"" symbols).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N (since they are in the secret word).
- Must exclude C, R, and E (since they are absent).
- A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4 (to avoid repeating invalid positions).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O) to maximize information.

After evaluating options:
- ""SATIN"" is chosen because:
  - Contains A (position 2) and N (position 5), both in new valid positions.
  - Tests new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I.
  - Avoids repeated letters and excluded letters (C, R, E).
  - Provides broad positional coverage for A and N while probing new consonants and a vowel.

<thinking>
Feedback from first guess: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
- Absent letters: C, R, E
- Present letters: A, N (but not in positions 3 or 4)
- A must be in a new position (not 3): valid positions are 1, 2, 4, 5.
- N must be in a new position (not 4): valid positions are 1, 2, 3, 5.

Goal for second guess:
- Include A and N in new positions.
- Exclude C, R, E.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O, D, M, P, Y).

Evaluated candidates:
- ""PLANT"": Invalid (A in position 3, which is disallowed).
- ""PAINT"": Invalid (N in position 4, disallowed).
- ""NASTY"": Valid (A in 2, N in 1; tests S, T, Y), but places A and N adjacently, potentially limiting positional info.
- ""TANGO"": Valid (A in 2, N in 3; tests T, G, O), but G is less common.
- ""SATIN"": Valid (A in 2, N in 5; tests S, T, I). Spreads A and N apart, tests high-frequency letters (S, T, I), and avoids redundancy.

""SATIN"" is optimal:
- Tests 3 new letters (S, T, I) with high information value.
- Positions A and N in untried slots (A in 2, N in 5).
- Complies with all constraints.
</thinking>

<guess>SATIN</guess>",SATIN,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were in (position 3 and 4 respectively in ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and N (since they are present in the word)
- Does not include C, R, or E (since they are absent)
- Places A and N in positions different from the first guess (i.e., A cannot be in the 3rd position, N cannot be in the 4th position)

Additionally, we want to maximize information by:
- Using other common letters that haven't been tested yet (like T, O, I, S, L, etc.)
- Avoiding letters we already know are absent (C, R, E)

Let's think of words that contain A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible letters to use: We have 3 more letters to choose (since A and N are fixed). We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels: O, I, U (but we already have A, so maybe one more vowel?).

We also note that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4.

Let's try to form a word that has A and N, and also includes T, O, S, or other common letters.

Some candidate words:
- ""PLANT"": 
  - Contains A and N (and also P, L, T)
  - But note: in ""PLANT"", A is in position 3? Actually: 
      P L A N T -> A is in position 3, but in the first guess ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and we know it's not in that position. So we cannot put A in position 3 again. Therefore, ""PLANT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

- ""PAINT"": 
  - P A I N T -> A is in position 2, N is in position 4. 
  - But in the first guess, N was in position 4 and we know it's not in position 4. So we cannot put N in position 4. Therefore, ""PAINT"" is invalid.

- ""SAINT"": 
  - S A I N T -> A in position 2, N in position 4 -> again, N in position 4 is not allowed.

We need to avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

Let's try to put A in a new position and N in a new position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (since not 3)
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (since not 4)

Another candidate: ""MANGO"" -> but we cannot use E? Actually, we can only avoid C, R, E. But ""MANGO"" has O and G. However, we must avoid E? It doesn't have E. But wait, we are avoiding C, R, E. So ""MANGO"" is okay? But let's check positions:
  M A N G O -> A is in position 2 (okay, not 3), N is in position 3 (okay, not 4). 
But we also have to consider that the word must be valid. However, note that the feedback for the first guess said A and N are present, so we must include them.

But wait: ""MANGO"" has the letter O and G, which we haven't tested. However, we are allowed to use any letters except C, R, E.

But is ""MANGO"" a valid word? Yes.

But we can do better: we want to test more common letters. Also, we have two new letters: M and G and O. That's three new letters. But we might want to test more frequent letters.

Another candidate: ""STAND""
  S T A N D -> 
    A is in position 3? -> but we cannot put A in position 3. So invalid.

""TALON"": 
  T A L O N -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  Letters: T, A, L, O, N -> includes A and N, and new letters T, L, O. 
  Avoids C, R, E.

But note: we have two positions for A and N that are acceptable.

Another candidate: ""ALONG""
  A L O N G -> 
    A in position 1 (okay), N in position 4 -> but we cannot put N in position 4 (because in CRANE it was in 4 and was wrong). So invalid.

""ADMIN"": 
  A D M I N -> 
    A in position 1 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  Letters: A, D, M, I, N -> new letters D, M, I.

But we might prefer more common letters.

""DAUNT"": 
  D A U N T -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 4 -> not allowed (position 4 for N is invalid).

""NASTY"": 
  N A S T Y -> 
    N in position 1 (okay), A in position 2 (okay). 
  But note: we have to be cautious because we are putting N at the start and A at position 2. 
  This word uses S, T, Y as new letters.

This seems acceptable.

But let's check: 
  In ""NASTY"": 
    N is in position 1 (which is new, since previously N was in 4 and now we are trying 1)
    A is in position 2 (previously was in 3, now 2 is new)

So ""NASTY"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" we already saw is invalid because of N in 4.

""OCTAN"" -> but O is allowed? Yes, but it has C? C is not allowed (we know C is absent). So invalid.

""LANTS"" -> not a common word? Actually, we need a valid English word. ""LANT"" is not common, but ""SLANT"" is.

""SLANT"": 
  S L A N T -> 
    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because in CRANE, A was in 3 and it was wrong position, so it cannot be in 3 again). 
  So invalid.

""TAKEN"" -> but E is not allowed? We know E is absent, so we cannot use E. So invalid.

""TANGO"": 
  T A N G O -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 3 (okay). 
  This uses T, G, O.

But note: we are putting N in position 3, which is new (previously it was in 4). So that's acceptable.

However, we have two candidates: ""NASTY"" and ""TANGO"". 

We want to maximize information. In ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1 and A at position 2, and also S, T, Y. In ""TANGO"", we are testing T, A, N, G, O.

We also note that we have two letters we know are in the word (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions and also discover other letters.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated, such as S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

But we must avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.

Let me try to list words that have A and N, without C, R, E, and with A not in 3 and N not in 4.

- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> A in 2 (okay), but no N? We must include N. So invalid.

- ""PAINS"": P A I N S -> A in 2 (okay), N in 4 -> not allowed.

- ""MAINS"": same issue, N in 4.

- ""SAUNA"": S A U N A -> A in 2 and 5, N in 4 -> N in 4 is not allowed.

- ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses B, J, O.

But J is not very common. We might get less information.

- ""WAGON"": W A G O N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses W, G, O.

- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses H, D, Y.

- ""PANSY"": P A N S Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses P, S, Y.

""PANSY"" seems good: 
  Positions: 
    P (1), A (2), N (3), S (4), Y (5)
  A is in 2 (new, not 3) -> okay
  N is in 3 (new, not 4) -> okay
  We are testing P, S, Y which are common.

But note: we are putting N in position 3. Is that acceptable? Yes, because the feedback only said that N is not in position 4, but it could be in 3.

Similarly, A is in 2, which is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""NADIR"": but R is not allowed? We know R is absent. So invalid.

""LATIN"": L A T I N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses L, T, I.

But we don't have the letter S? We might want to test S because it's very common.

We have to choose one.

I think ""PANSY"" is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (P, S, Y) and places A and N in new positions.

Alternatively, ""NASTY"" is also good: 
  N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. 
  This tests N at the start (which we haven't tried) and A in 2, and also S, T, Y.

But note: in ""NASTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and N in position 1. We know that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4. So positions 1 and 2 for N and A are both new.

However, we are using two positions that we haven't tested for A and N. 

But we have to be cautious: if we put both A and N in new positions, we might get more information about their correct positions.

But also, we are testing three new letters: S, T, Y.

Similarly, ""PANSY"" tests P, S, Y and puts A in 2 and N in 3.

I think both are reasonable. But let me see which one covers more common letters.

The frequency of letters in English words (for 5-letter words) might help. Common letters: S, T, L, N (but we already know N), A (we know A), then P, O, I, etc.

S and T are very common. So both ""NASTY"" and ""PANSY"" have S and T? Actually, ""PANSY"" has S and Y, but not T. ""NASTY"" has S, T, and Y.

So ""NASTY"" tests T as well, which is more common than P.

Therefore, I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.

But wait: in ""NASTY"", we are putting N in position 1. We don't know if that is correct. Similarly, A in position 2. But that's the point: we are testing these positions.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put A and N in adjacent positions to get more positional information.

But I think ""NASTY"" is a solid choice.

Another candidate: ""STAIN"" -> 
  S T A I N -> 
    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.

""SATIN"": 
  S A T I N -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  This uses S, T, I.

But note: we are putting A in 2 and N in 5. This is acceptable.

And we are testing S, T, I.

But we are not testing Y? That's okay. We can test Y later.

""SATIN"" is also a good candidate because it uses very common letters.

But we already know that A and N are in the word, so we are focusing on finding their positions and discovering other letters.

Between ""NASTY"" and ""SATIN"", which one?

""NASTY"": tests N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.
""SATIN"": tests S in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, N in 5.

We know that A is not in 3, so in ""SATIN"", T is in 3 and that's a new letter in that position. Also, we are testing I.

But note: we have no information about I, so it's good to test.

However, in ""NASTY"", we are testing Y which is less common than I? Actually, I is more common.

But we are also testing T in both. 

I think ""SATIN"" might be better because it uses I (a common vowel) and avoids putting two known letters (A and N) in the first two positions, which might be less likely? Not necessarily.

But let's consider: we have two known letters (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions. In ""SATIN"", we are putting A in 2 and N in 5, which are two different positions. In ""NASTY"", we are putting both at the front.

We might get more information if we spread them out.

But I don't have a strong preference.

Another candidate: ""POINT"" -> but we must include A and N? We cannot leave out A or N because we know they are in the word. So we must include both.

Therefore, we must choose a word that contains both A and N.

After considering, I think ""SATIN"" is a good choice because:
- It uses common letters: S, A, T, I, N.
- It places A in position 2 (which is new) and N in position 5 (which is new, since previously N was in 4).
- It tests the vowel I, which is common.

Alternatively, ""TAINT"" -> but T is repeated? We want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information. ""TAINT"" has two T's. So not ideal.

""SAINT"" is invalid because N is in 4.

So I'll go with ""SATIN"".

But let me confirm: 
  S A T I N
  A is in position 2 (which is not 3, so okay)
  N is in position 5 (which is not 4, so okay)

And the word is valid.

We are testing S, T, I, and we already know A and N are present.

So we can get information about S, T, I and the positions of A and N.

Therefore, I choose ""SATIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are absent from the secret word.
- A and N are present but not in positions 3 or 4 (as indicated by the ""-"" symbols).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N (since they are in the secret word).
- Must exclude C, R, and E (since they are absent).
- A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4 (to avoid repeating invalid positions).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O) to maximize information.

After evaluating options:
- ""SATIN"" is chosen because:
  - Contains A (position 2) and N (position 5), both in new valid positions.
  - Tests new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I.
  - Avoids repeated letters and excluded letters (C, R, E).
  - Provides broad positional coverage for A and N while probing new consonants and a vowel.

<thinking>
Feedback from first guess: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
- Absent letters: C, R, E
- Present letters: A, N (but not in positions 3 or 4)
- A must be in a new position (not 3): valid positions are 1, 2, 4, 5.
- N must be in a new position (not 4): valid positions are 1, 2, 3, 5.

Goal for second guess:
- Include A and N in new positions.
- Exclude C, R, E.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O, D, M, P, Y).

Evaluated candidates:
- ""PLANT"": Invalid (A in position 3, which is disallowed).
- ""PAINT"": Invalid (N in position 4, disallowed).
- ""NASTY"": Valid (A in 2, N in 1; tests S, T, Y), but places A and N adjacently, potentially limiting positional info.
- ""TANGO"": Valid (A in 2, N in 3; tests T, G, O), but G is less common.
- ""SATIN"": Valid (A in 2, N in 5; tests S, T, I). Spreads A and N apart, tests high-frequency letters (S, T, I), and avoids redundancy.

""SATIN"" is optimal:
- Tests 3 new letters (S, T, I) with high information value.
- Positions A and N in untried slots (A in 2, N in 5).
- Complies with all constraints.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,DANDY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a strong starting word.
 A good starting word often has:
   - 5 different letters to maximize information.
   - Common letters to increase the chance of hitting some in the secret word.
 Examples of such words: ""CRANE"", ""SALET"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, my first guess is CRANE.<thinking>
I'm starting a new game with no prior guesses or feedback. For an optimal first guess in Wordle, I should use a word that:
- Contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information
- Avoids repeated letters
- Has letters that frequently appear in English words

""CRANE"" is an excellent starting word because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N)
- Uses five distinct letters
- Covers frequently used letters like R, A, and E
- Has been statistically proven effective in Wordle strategies

This first guess will help establish which letters are present/absent and potentially reveal correct positions, setting up stronger subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were in (position 3 and 4 respectively in ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and N (since they are present in the word)
- Does not include C, R, or E (since they are absent)
- Places A and N in positions different from the first guess (i.e., A cannot be in the 3rd position, N cannot be in the 4th position)

Additionally, we want to maximize information by:
- Using other common letters that haven't been tested yet (like T, O, I, S, L, etc.)
- Avoiding letters we already know are absent (C, R, E)

Let's think of words that contain A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible letters to use: We have 3 more letters to choose (since A and N are fixed). We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels: O, I, U (but we already have A, so maybe one more vowel?).

We also note that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4.

Let's try to form a word that has A and N, and also includes T, O, S, or other common letters.

Some candidate words:
- ""PLANT"": 
  - Contains A and N (and also P, L, T)
  - But note: in ""PLANT"", A is in position 3? Actually: 
      P L A N T -> A is in position 3, but in the first guess ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and we know it's not in that position. So we cannot put A in position 3 again. Therefore, ""PLANT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

- ""PAINT"": 
  - P A I N T -> A is in position 2, N is in position 4. 
  - But in the first guess, N was in position 4 and we know it's not in position 4. So we cannot put N in position 4. Therefore, ""PAINT"" is invalid.

- ""SAINT"": 
  - S A I N T -> A in position 2, N in position 4 -> again, N in position 4 is not allowed.

We need to avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

Let's try to put A in a new position and N in a new position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (since not 3)
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (since not 4)

Another candidate: ""MANGO"" -> but we cannot use E? Actually, we can only avoid C, R, E. But ""MANGO"" has O and G. However, we must avoid E? It doesn't have E. But wait, we are avoiding C, R, E. So ""MANGO"" is okay? But let's check positions:
  M A N G O -> A is in position 2 (okay, not 3), N is in position 3 (okay, not 4). 
But we also have to consider that the word must be valid. However, note that the feedback for the first guess said A and N are present, so we must include them.

But wait: ""MANGO"" has the letter O and G, which we haven't tested. However, we are allowed to use any letters except C, R, E.

But is ""MANGO"" a valid word? Yes.

But we can do better: we want to test more common letters. Also, we have two new letters: M and G and O. That's three new letters. But we might want to test more frequent letters.

Another candidate: ""STAND""
  S T A N D -> 
    A is in position 3? -> but we cannot put A in position 3. So invalid.

""TALON"": 
  T A L O N -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  Letters: T, A, L, O, N -> includes A and N, and new letters T, L, O. 
  Avoids C, R, E.

But note: we have two positions for A and N that are acceptable.

Another candidate: ""ALONG""
  A L O N G -> 
    A in position 1 (okay), N in position 4 -> but we cannot put N in position 4 (because in CRANE it was in 4 and was wrong). So invalid.

""ADMIN"": 
  A D M I N -> 
    A in position 1 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  Letters: A, D, M, I, N -> new letters D, M, I.

But we might prefer more common letters.

""DAUNT"": 
  D A U N T -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 4 -> not allowed (position 4 for N is invalid).

""NASTY"": 
  N A S T Y -> 
    N in position 1 (okay), A in position 2 (okay). 
  But note: we have to be cautious because we are putting N at the start and A at position 2. 
  This word uses S, T, Y as new letters.

This seems acceptable.

But let's check: 
  In ""NASTY"": 
    N is in position 1 (which is new, since previously N was in 4 and now we are trying 1)
    A is in position 2 (previously was in 3, now 2 is new)

So ""NASTY"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" we already saw is invalid because of N in 4.

""OCTAN"" -> but O is allowed? Yes, but it has C? C is not allowed (we know C is absent). So invalid.

""LANTS"" -> not a common word? Actually, we need a valid English word. ""LANT"" is not common, but ""SLANT"" is.

""SLANT"": 
  S L A N T -> 
    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because in CRANE, A was in 3 and it was wrong position, so it cannot be in 3 again). 
  So invalid.

""TAKEN"" -> but E is not allowed? We know E is absent, so we cannot use E. So invalid.

""TANGO"": 
  T A N G O -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 3 (okay). 
  This uses T, G, O.

But note: we are putting N in position 3, which is new (previously it was in 4). So that's acceptable.

However, we have two candidates: ""NASTY"" and ""TANGO"". 

We want to maximize information. In ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1 and A at position 2, and also S, T, Y. In ""TANGO"", we are testing T, A, N, G, O.

We also note that we have two letters we know are in the word (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions and also discover other letters.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated, such as S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

But we must avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.

Let me try to list words that have A and N, without C, R, E, and with A not in 3 and N not in 4.

- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> A in 2 (okay), but no N? We must include N. So invalid.

- ""PAINS"": P A I N S -> A in 2 (okay), N in 4 -> not allowed.

- ""MAINS"": same issue, N in 4.

- ""SAUNA"": S A U N A -> A in 2 and 5, N in 4 -> N in 4 is not allowed.

- ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses B, J, O.

But J is not very common. We might get less information.

- ""WAGON"": W A G O N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses W, G, O.

- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses H, D, Y.

- ""PANSY"": P A N S Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses P, S, Y.

""PANSY"" seems good: 
  Positions: 
    P (1), A (2), N (3), S (4), Y (5)
  A is in 2 (new, not 3) -> okay
  N is in 3 (new, not 4) -> okay
  We are testing P, S, Y which are common.

But note: we are putting N in position 3. Is that acceptable? Yes, because the feedback only said that N is not in position 4, but it could be in 3.

Similarly, A is in 2, which is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""NADIR"": but R is not allowed? We know R is absent. So invalid.

""LATIN"": L A T I N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses L, T, I.

So we can get information about S, T, I and the positions of A and N.

Therefore, I choose ""SATIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are absent from the secret word.
- A and N are present but not in positions 3 or 4 (as indicated by the ""-"" symbols).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N (since they are in the secret word).
- Must exclude C, R, and E (since they are absent).
- A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4 (to avoid repeating invalid positions).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O) to maximize information.

After evaluating options:
- ""SATIN"" is chosen because:
  - Contains A (position 2) and N (position 5), both in new valid positions.
  - Tests new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I.
  - Avoids repeated letters and excluded letters (C, R, E).
  - Provides broad positional coverage for A and N while probing new consonants and a vowel.

<thinking>
Feedback from first guess: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
- Absent letters: C, R, E
- Present letters: A, N (but not in positions 3 or 4)
- A must be in a new position (not 3): valid positions are 1, 2, 4, 5.
- N must be in a new position (not 4): valid positions are 1, 2, 3, 5.

Goal for second guess:
- Include A and N in new positions.
- Exclude C, R, E.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O, D, M, P, Y).

Evaluated candidates:
- ""PLANT"": Invalid (A in position 3, which is disallowed).
- ""PAINT"": Invalid (N in position 4, disallowed).
- ""NASTY"": Valid (A in 2, N in 1; tests S, T, Y), but places A and N adjacently, potentially limiting positional info.
- ""TANGO"": Valid (A in 2, N in 3; tests T, G, O), but G is less common.
- ""SATIN"": Valid (A in 2, N in 5; tests S, T, I). Spreads A and N apart, tests high-frequency letters (S, T, I), and avoids redundancy.

""SATIN"" is optimal:
- Tests 3 new letters (S, T, I) with high information value.
- Positions A and N in untried slots (A in 2, N in 5).
- Complies with all constraints.

Actually, we can only avoid C, R, E. But ""MANGO"" has O and G. However, we must avoid E? It doesn\'t have E. But wait, we are avoiding C, R, E. So ""MANGO"" is okay? But let\'s check positions:\n  M A N G O -> A is in position 2 (okay, not 3), N is in position 3 (okay, not 4). \nBut we also have to consider that the word must be valid. However, note that the feedback for the first guess said A and N are present, so we must include them.\n\nBut wait: ""MANGO"" has the letter O and G, which we haven\'t tested. However, we are allowed to use any letters except C, R, E.\n\nBut is ""MANGO"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut we can do better: we want to test more common letters. Also, we have two new letters: M and G and O. That\'s three new letters.

We know E is absent, so we cannot use E. So invalid.\n\n""TANGO"": \n  T A N G O -> \n    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 3 (okay). \n  This uses T, G, O.\n\nBut note: we are putting N in position 3, which is new (previously it was in 4). So that\'s acceptable.\n\nHowever, we have two candidates: ""NASTY"" and ""TANGO"". \n\nWe want to maximize information. In ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1 and A at position 2, and also S, T, Y. In ""TANGO"", we are testing T, A, N, G, O.\n\nWe also note that we have two letters we know are in the word (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions and also discover other letters.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t eliminated, such as S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.\n\nBut we must avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.\n\nLet me try to list words that have A and N, without C, R, E, and with A not in 3 and N not in 4.\n\n- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> A in 2 (okay), but no N? We must include N.

This uses B, J, O.\n\nBut J is not very common. We might get less information.\n\n- ""WAGON"": W A G O N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses W, G, O.\n\n- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses H, D, Y.\n\n- ""PANSY"": P A N S Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses P, S, Y.\n\n""PANSY"" seems good: \n  Positions: \n    P (1), A (2), N (3), S (4), Y (5)\n  A is in 2 (new, not 3) -> okay\n  N is in 3 (new, not 4) -> okay\n  We are testing P, S, Y which are common.\n\nBut note: we are putting N in position 3. Is that acceptable? Yes, because the feedback only said that N is not in position 4, but it could be in 3.\n\nSimilarly, A is in 2, which is acceptable.\n\nAnother candidate: ""NADIR"": but R is not allowed? We know R is absent. So invalid.\n\n""LATIN"": L A T I N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses L, T, I.\n\nBut we don\'t have the letter S? We might want to test S because it\'s very common.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nI think ""PANSY"" is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (P, S, Y) and places A and N in new positions.\n\nAlternatively, ""NASTY"" is also good: \n  N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. \n  This tests N at the start (which we haven\'t tried) and A in 2, and also S, T, Y.\n\nBut note: in ""NASTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and N in position 1. We know that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4. So positions 1 and 2 for N and A are both new.\n\nHowever, we are using two positions that we haven\'t tested for A and N. \n\nBut we have to be cautious: if we put both A and N in new positions, we might get more information about their correct positions.\n\nBut also, we are testing three new letters: S, T, Y.\n\nSimilarly, ""PANSY"" tests P, S, Y and puts A in 2 and N in 3.\n\nI think both are reasonable. But let me see which one covers more common letters.\n\nThe frequency of letters in English words (for 5-letter words) might help. Common letters: S, T, L, N (but we already know N), A (we know A), then P, O, I, etc.\n\nS and T are very common. So both ""NASTY"" and ""PANSY"" have S and T? Actually, ""PANSY"" has S and Y, but not T. ""NASTY"" has S, T, and Y.\n\nSo ""NASTY"" tests T as well, which is more common than P.\n\nTherefore, I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.\n\nBut wait: in ""NASTY"", we are putting N in position 1. We don\'t know if that is correct. Similarly, A in position 2. But that\'s the point: we are testing these positions.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t put A and N in adjacent positions to get more positional information.\n\nBut I think ""NASTY"" is a solid choice.\n\nAnother candidate: ""STAIN"" -> \n  S T A I N -> \n    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.\n\n""SATIN"": \n  S A T I N -> \n    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). \n  This uses S, T, I.\n\nBut note: we are putting A in 2 and N in 5. This is acceptable.\n\nAnd we are testing S, T, I.\n\nBut we are not testing Y? That\'s okay. We can test Y later.\n\n""SATIN"" is also a good candidate because it uses very common letters.\n\nBut we already know that A and N are in the word, so we are focusing on finding their positions and discovering other letters.\n\nBetween ""NASTY"" and ""SATIN"", which one?\n\n""NASTY"": tests N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.\n""SATIN"": tests S in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, N in 5.\n\nWe know that A is not in 3, so in ""SATIN"", T is in 3 and that\'s a new letter in that position. Also, we are testing I.\n\nBut note: we have no information about I, so it\'s good to test.\n\nHowever, in ""NASTY"", we are testing Y which is less common than I? Actually, I is more common.\n\nBut we are also testing T in both. \n\nI think ""SATIN"" might be better because it uses I (a common vowel) and avoids putting two known letters (A and N) in the first two positions, which might be less likely? Not necessarily.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have two known letters (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions. In ""SATIN"", we are putting A in 2 and N in 5, which are two different positions. In ""NASTY"", we are putting both at the front.\n\nWe might get more information if we spread them out.\n\nBut I don\'t have a strong preference.\n\nAnother candidate: ""POINT"" -> but we must include A and N? We cannot leave out A or N because we know they are in the word. So we must include both.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word that contains both A and N.\n\nAfter considering, I think ""SATIN"" is a good choice because:\n- It uses common letters: S, A, T, I, N.\n- It places A in position 2 (which is new) and N in position 5 (which is new, since previously N was in 4).\n- It tests the vowel I, which is common.\n\nAlternatively, ""TAINT"" -> but T is repeated? We want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information. ""TAINT"" has two T\'s. So not ideal.\n\n""SAINT"" is invalid because N is in 4.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SATIN"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  S A T I N\n  A is in position 2 (which is not 3, so okay)\n  N is in position 5 (which is not 4, so okay)\n\nAnd the word is valid.\n\nWe are testing S, T, I, and we already know A and N are present.\n\nSo we can get information about S, T, I and the positions of A and N.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""SATIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, and E are absent from the secret word.\n- A and N are present but not in positions 3 or 4 (as indicated by the ""-"" symbols).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A and N (since they are in the secret word).\n- Must exclude C, R, and E (since they are absent).\n- A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4 (to avoid repeating invalid positions).\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O) to maximize information.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""SATIN"" is chosen because:\n  - Contains A (position 2) and N (position 5), both in new valid positions.\n  - Tests new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I.\n  - Avoids repeated letters and excluded letters (C, R, E).\n  - Provides broad positional coverage for A and N while probing new consonants and a vowel.\n\n<thinking>\nFeedback from first guess: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)\n- Absent letters: C, R, E\n- Present letters: A, N (but not in positions 3 or 4)\n- A must be in a new position (not 3): valid positions are 1, 2, 4, 5.\n- N must be in a new position (not 4): valid positions are 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\nGoal for second guess:\n- Include A and N in new positions.\n- Exclude C, R, E.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O, D, M, P, Y).\n\nEvaluated candidates:\n- ""PLANT"": Invalid (A in position 3, which is disallowed).\n- ""PAINT"": Invalid (N in position 4, disallowed).\n- ""NASTY"": Valid (A in 2, N in 1; tests S, T, Y), but places A and N adjacently, potentially limiting positional info.\n- ""TANGO"": Valid (A in 2, N in 3; tests T, G, O), but G is less common.\n- ""SATIN"": Valid (A in 2, N in 5; tests S, T, I).

We are given feedback for the second guess ""SATIN"":
  S: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is in position 2)
  T: x (not in the word)
  I: x (not in the word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word has A in the second position (position 2).
- The letter N is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in SATIN and marked as wrong position).
- The letters S, T, I are not in the word.
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know C, R, E are not in the word, and A is in the word (now we know it's in position 2) and N is in the word (but not in position 4 or 5).

Summary of absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I
Present letters: A (fixed at position 2), N (present but not in position 4 or 5)

Now, we must choose a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Includes N (but not in position 4 or 5, so positions 1, 2, or 3; but position 2 is taken by A, so N can be in 1 or 3).
- Does not include C, R, E, S, T, I.

We also want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

The secret word has 5 letters. We know one of them is A in position 2, and one is N (in position 1 or 3). So we have three more letters to discover.

Common letters not yet tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Since N can only be in position 1 or 3, we can consider two cases.

Let's try to form words with A in position 2 and N in position 1 or 3.

First, if N is in position 1:
  N _ A _ _ 
The third position is open, and then two more letters.

Second, if N is in position 3:
  _ _ N A _ 
But note: the second position is A, so if N is in position 3, then the word has: [letter1] A N [letter4] [letter5]

We don't know which case, so we might want to choose a word that tests one of these and also tests new letters.

But note: we have to include N, so we must choose one of the positions for N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 1 or 3 and also includes other new letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, try N in position 1:
  N _ A _ _ 
We need to fill the second blank (position 2 is A, so that's fixed) and positions 4 and 5.

But position 2 is A, so the word is: N A _ _ _

We need to choose three letters for positions 3,4,5, avoiding C,R,E,S,T,I and including N only once (since we don't have information about duplicates, but we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we don't know, but we haven't seen duplicates so we can assume none until we have evidence).

But note: the feedback for SATIN had N in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out that N might appear twice, but it's less likely. We'll assume no duplicates for efficiency.

So, for N in position 1: word pattern: N A _ _ _

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with letters that are not C,R,E,S,T,I and are not N (since we assume no duplicate).

Possible words:
- ""NAVAL"": but V and L are allowed? Yes, but let's check: N A V A L -> but A is repeated? We have A in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if A is repeated. The feedback for CRANE had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean there isn't another A. However, in SATIN, we had A in position 2 and it was correct, and no other A. But we don't know. To be safe, we should avoid assuming no duplicates for A? Actually, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we can try.

But let's see: in ""NAVAL"", we have A in position 2 (correct) and also in position 4. But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we are trying to guess, so it's acceptable. But we are also testing V and L.

But note: we are putting N in position 1, which is a possibility.

Another word: ""NADIR"" -> but R is absent (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.

""NASTY"" -> but S and T are absent, so invalid.

""NABOB"" -> B and O, but not a common word? And we have two B's? ""NABOB"" is a word, but we are testing B and O.

But we want common words.

""NAHAL"" -> not common.

""NAKED"" -> E is absent, so invalid.

""NAPPY"" -> P and Y. Word: N A P P Y -> but P repeated? And we are testing P and Y.

But we don't know if P is in the word.

Another word: ""NAVAL"" as above.

But let's consider the other case: N in position 3.

Pattern: _ _ N A _ 
That is: [letter1] A N [letter4] [letter5]  (since position 2 is A, position 3 is N)

So the word: ? A N ? ?

We need to choose letters for positions 1,4,5, avoiding C,R,E,S,T,I.

Possible words:
- ""BANAL"": B A N A L -> but A repeated? And we are testing B and L.
- ""CANAL"" -> C is absent, invalid.
- ""DANDY"" -> D and Y. Word: D A N D Y -> D repeated? And we are testing D and Y.
- ""FANCY"" -> F and C? C is absent, invalid.
- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> tests H, D, Y. No duplicates. This seems good.
- ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.
- ""PANDA"": P A N D A -> A repeated, and D.
- ""WANLY"": W A N L Y -> tests W, L, Y.

We have two main cases: N in position 1 (pattern N A _ _ _) or N in position 3 (pattern _ A N _ _).

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and tests new letters.

But note: we don't know which pattern is correct, so we might want to choose a word that helps distinguish between these cases and also tests new letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in one of the allowed positions and tests multiple new common letters.

Given that we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's list the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, and others.

We have 3 or 4 new letters to test (depending on the pattern).

But note: in the pattern for N in position 1, we have three blanks (positions 3,4,5). In the pattern for N in position 3, we have three blanks (positions 1,4,5). So in both cases, we have three new letters to find.

We can try to use a word that has N in position 1 or 3 and includes three new common letters.

But we must decide the position for N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix N to one position but tests both possibilities? That might be hard.

We know N must be in position 1 or 3. So we can choose a word that has N in one of these positions and then see the feedback.

I think it's better to pick one case and test it.

But which one? We don't have information to prefer one over the other.

We can choose a word that tests N in position 1 and also tests common letters, and if it's wrong, then N must be in position 3.

Similarly, we can do the opposite.

But we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has N in position 3 and also tests letters that are common, and then we can get information about the other positions.

Let me try to choose ""HANDY"": 
  H A N D Y
  This assumes N is in position 3 (so pattern _ A N _ _) and tests H, D, Y.

But if N is actually in position 1, then this word would not have N in position 3 and we would get feedback that N is not in the word? But we know N is in the word, so if we put N in position 3 and it's not there, then the feedback for N would be '-' (wrong position) or 'x' if it's not in the word at all? But we know it is in the word, so if we put it in position 3 and it's not there, it would be '-'. But we already know it's not in position 4 or 5, so if it's not in 3, then it must be in 1.

So by putting N in position 3, we can confirm if it is there or not.

Similarly, if we put N in position 1, we can see if it is there.

So let's choose a word that puts N in one of the positions, say position 3, and tests new letters.

I'll go with ""HANDY"": 
  H A N D Y
  - Position 1: H (new)
  - Position 2: A (correct, we know)
  - Position 3: N (we are testing if it is here)
  - Position 4: D (new)
  - Position 5: Y (new)

If N is in position 3, then we get a check for N. If not, then we get a '-' for N and we know it must be in position 1.

Additionally, we test H, D, Y.

But note: we are using a pattern that requires position 3 to be N. If it's not, then we know N is in 1.

But we are also testing three new letters.

Another candidate: ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.

But ""HANDY"" seems fine.

We could also test more common letters. For example, ""PANSY"" but S is absent, so invalid.

""BALDY"" -> B A L D Y -> but this doesn't have N? We must include N. So invalid.

We must include N.

So ""HANDY"" is a valid choice.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more common letters.

Common letters: L, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

What about ""ALONG""? But we don't have N in position 1 or 3? ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> but A is in position 1? But we need A in position 2. So invalid.

""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but I is absent, and also N is in position 5? But we know N is not in position 5 (from SATIN feedback: N in position 5 was wrong). So we cannot put N in 5. Also, I is absent.

""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> but T is absent, and N is in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4 (from CRANE: N in 4 was wrong). So invalid.

""LAUND"" -> not a word.

So ""HANDY"" seems reasonable.

Another option: ""BANAL"" -> B A N A L -> but A repeated? And we are testing B and L. But if there is no second A, then it might not be good. But we don't know.

""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> A repeated.

I think ""HANDY"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""HANDY"".Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from SATIN).
- N is present but not in position 5 (from SATIN) and not in position 4 (from CRANE), so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I.

Strategy for the next guess:
- Must include A in position 2 and N in either position 1 or 3.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., D, H, L, M, O, P, Y) while avoiding absent letters.

Chosen word: ""HANDY""
- Structure: H (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), N (position 3, testing if N is here), D (position 4), Y (position 5).
- Tests N in position 3 (if correct, we get confirmation; if not, N must be in position 1).
- Tests three new letters: H, D, Y (all common and untested).

<thinking>
Feedback from previous guesses:
1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x) → A and N present, but not in positions 3 and 4.
2. SATIN: S(x), A(✓), T(x), I(x), N(-) → A confirmed in position 2; N present but not in position 5; S, T, I absent.

Thus:
- A is fixed at position 2.
- N must be in position 1 or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are invalid per feedback).
- Absent letters: C, E, R, S, T, I.

""HANDY"" is selected because:
- Complies with A in position 2.
- Places N in position 3 (one of the two possible positions).
- Tests new letters H, D, Y (high value for information gain).
- If N is in position 3, we get confirmation; if not, we learn N must be in position 1.
- Avoids all absent letters and repeats.
</thinking>

<guess>HANDY</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(absent).  
- **Guess 2 (SATIN)**: S(absent), A(correct position), T(absent), I(absent), N(present but wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
- **A** is confirmed in **position 2** (from SATIN's ✓).
- **N** is present but **not in position 4** (from CRANE) or **position 5** (from SATIN), so it must be in **position 1 or 3**.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I (cannot be used).
- **Present letters**: A (fixed at position 2), N (must be in position 1 or 3).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **N in position 3** (to resolve its location—if not here, it must be in position 1).
- Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., **D, H, Y**) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters and respect A's fixed position.

### Chosen Guess: **HANDY**
- **H** (position 1): New letter test.
- **A** (position 2): Fixed (✓).
- **N** (position 3): Tests if N is here (if not, N must be in position 1).
- **D** (position 4): New letter test.
- **Y** (position 5): New letter test.

This guess efficiently narrows down N's position while probing three new common letters.

<guess>HANDY</guess>",HANDY,"We are given feedback for the second guess ""SATIN"":
  S: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is in position 2)
  T: x (not in the word)
  I: x (not in the word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word has A in the second position (position 2).
- The letter N is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in SATIN and marked as wrong position).
- The letters S, T, I are not in the word.
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know C, R, E are not in the word, and A is in the word (now we know it's in position 2) and N is in the word (but not in position 4 or 5).

Summary of absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I
Present letters: A (fixed at position 2), N (present but not in position 4 or 5)

Now, we must choose a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Includes N (but not in position 4 or 5, so positions 1, 2, or 3; but position 2 is taken by A, so N can be in 1 or 3).
- Does not include C, R, E, S, T, I.

We also want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

The secret word has 5 letters. We know one of them is A in position 2, and one is N (in position 1 or 3). So we have three more letters to discover.

Common letters not yet tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Since N can only be in position 1 or 3, we can consider two cases.

Let's try to form words with A in position 2 and N in position 1 or 3.

First, if N is in position 1:
  N _ A _ _ 
The third position is open, and then two more letters.

Second, if N is in position 3:
  _ _ N A _ 
But note: the second position is A, so if N is in position 3, then the word has: [letter1] A N [letter4] [letter5]

We don't know which case, so we might want to choose a word that tests one of these and also tests new letters.

But note: we have to include N, so we must choose one of the positions for N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 1 or 3 and also includes other new letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, try N in position 1:
  N _ A _ _ 
We need to fill the second blank (position 2 is A, so that's fixed) and positions 4 and 5.

But position 2 is A, so the word is: N A _ _ _

We need to choose three letters for positions 3,4,5, avoiding C,R,E,S,T,I and including N only once (since we don't have information about duplicates, but we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we don't know, but we haven't seen duplicates so we can assume none until we have evidence).

But note: the feedback for SATIN had N in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out that N might appear twice, but it's less likely. We'll assume no duplicates for efficiency.

So, for N in position 1: word pattern: N A _ _ _

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with letters that are not C,R,E,S,T,I and are not N (since we assume no duplicate).

Possible words:
- ""NAVAL"": but V and L are allowed? Yes, but let's check: N A V A L -> but A is repeated? We have A in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if A is repeated. The feedback for CRANE had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean there isn't another A. However, in SATIN, we had A in position 2 and it was correct, and no other A. But we don't know. To be safe, we should avoid assuming no duplicates for A? Actually, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we can try.

But let's see: in ""NAVAL"", we have A in position 2 (correct) and also in position 4. But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we are trying to guess, so it's acceptable. But we are also testing V and L.

But note: we are putting N in position 1, which is a possibility.

Another word: ""NADIR"" -> but R is absent (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.

""NASTY"" -> but S and T are absent, so invalid.

""NABOB"" -> B and O, but not a common word? And we have two B's? ""NABOB"" is a word, but we are testing B and O.

But we want common words.

""NAHAL"" -> not common.

""NAKED"" -> E is absent, so invalid.

""NAPPY"" -> P and Y. Word: N A P P Y -> but P repeated? And we are testing P and Y.

But we don't know if P is in the word.

Another word: ""NAVAL"" as above.

But let's consider the other case: N in position 3.

Pattern: _ _ N A _ 
That is: [letter1] A N [letter4] [letter5]  (since position 2 is A, position 3 is N)

So the word: ? A N ? ?

We need to choose letters for positions 1,4,5, avoiding C,R,E,S,T,I.

Possible words:
- ""BANAL"": B A N A L -> but A repeated? And we are testing B and L.
- ""CANAL"" -> C is absent, invalid.
- ""DANDY"" -> D and Y. Word: D A N D Y -> D repeated? And we are testing D and Y.
- ""FANCY"" -> F and C? C is absent, invalid.
- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> tests H, D, Y. No duplicates. This seems good.
- ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.
- ""PANDA"": P A N D A -> A repeated, and D.
- ""WANLY"": W A N L Y -> tests W, L, Y.

We have two main cases: N in position 1 (pattern N A _ _ _) or N in position 3 (pattern _ A N _ _).

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and tests new letters.

But note: we don't know which pattern is correct, so we might want to choose a word that helps distinguish between these cases and also tests new letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in one of the allowed positions and tests multiple new common letters.

Given that we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's list the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, and others.

We have 3 or 4 new letters to test (depending on the pattern).

But note: in the pattern for N in position 1, we have three blanks (positions 3,4,5). In the pattern for N in position 3, we have three blanks (positions 1,4,5). So in both cases, we have three new letters to find.

We can try to use a word that has N in position 1 or 3 and includes three new common letters.

But we must decide the position for N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix N to one position but tests both possibilities? That might be hard.

We know N must be in position 1 or 3. So we can choose a word that has N in one of these positions and then see the feedback.

I think it's better to pick one case and test it.

But which one? We don't have information to prefer one over the other.

We can choose a word that tests N in position 1 and also tests common letters, and if it's wrong, then N must be in position 3.

Similarly, we can do the opposite.

But we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has N in position 3 and also tests letters that are common, and then we can get information about the other positions.

Let me try to choose ""HANDY"": 
  H A N D Y
  This assumes N is in position 3 (so pattern _ A N _ _) and tests H, D, Y.

But if N is actually in position 1, then this word would not have N in position 3 and we would get feedback that N is not in the word? But we know N is in the word, so if we put N in position 3 and it's not there, then the feedback for N would be '-' (wrong position) or 'x' if it's not in the word at all? But we know it is in the word, so if we put it in position 3 and it's not there, it would be '-'. But we already know it's not in position 4 or 5, so if it's not in 3, then it must be in 1.

So by putting N in position 3, we can confirm if it is there or not.

Similarly, if we put N in position 1, we can see if it is there.

So let's choose a word that puts N in one of the positions, say position 3, and tests new letters.

I'll go with ""HANDY"": 
  H A N D Y
  - Position 1: H (new)
  - Position 2: A (correct, we know)
  - Position 3: N (we are testing if it is here)
  - Position 4: D (new)
  - Position 5: Y (new)

If N is in position 3, then we get a check for N. If not, then we get a '-' for N and we know it must be in position 1.

Additionally, we test H, D, Y.

But note: we are using a pattern that requires position 3 to be N. If it's not, then we know N is in 1.

But we are also testing three new letters.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a strong starting word.
 A good starting word often has:
   - 5 different letters to maximize information.
   - Common letters to increase the chance of hitting some in the secret word.
 Examples of such words: ""CRANE"", ""SALET"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, my first guess is CRANE.<thinking>
I'm starting a new game with no prior guesses or feedback. For an optimal first guess in Wordle, I should use a word that:
- Contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information
- Avoids repeated letters
- Has letters that frequently appear in English words

""CRANE"" is an excellent starting word because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N)
- Uses five distinct letters
- Covers frequently used letters like R, A, and E
- Has been statistically proven effective in Wordle strategies

This first guess will help establish which letters are present/absent and potentially reveal correct positions, setting up stronger subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were in (position 3 and 4 respectively in ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and N (since they are present in the word)
- Does not include C, R, or E (since they are absent)
- Places A and N in positions different from the first guess (i.e., A cannot be in the 3rd position, N cannot be in the 4th position)

Additionally, we want to maximize information by:
- Using other common letters that haven't been tested yet (like T, O, I, S, L, etc.)
- Avoiding letters we already know are absent (C, R, E)

Let's think of words that contain A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible letters to use: We have 3 more letters to choose (since A and N are fixed). We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels: O, I, U (but we already have A, so maybe one more vowel?).

We also note that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4.

Let's try to form a word that has A and N, and also includes T, O, S, or other common letters.

Some candidate words:
- ""PLANT"": 
  - Contains A and N (and also P, L, T)
  - But note: in ""PLANT"", A is in position 3? Actually: 
      P L A N T -> A is in position 3, but in the first guess ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and we know it's not in that position. So we cannot put A in position 3 again. Therefore, ""PLANT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

- ""PAINT"": 
  - P A I N T -> A is in position 2, N is in position 4. 
  - But in the first guess, N was in position 4 and we know it's not in position 4. So we cannot put N in position 4. Therefore, ""PAINT"" is invalid.

- ""SAINT"": 
  - S A I N T -> A in position 2, N in position 4 -> again, N in position 4 is not allowed.

We need to avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

Let's try to put A in a new position and N in a new position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (since not 3)
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (since not 4)

Another candidate: ""MANGO"" -> but we cannot use E? Actually, we can only avoid C, R, E. But ""MANGO"" has O and G. However, we must avoid E? It doesn't have E. But wait, we are avoiding C, R, E. So ""MANGO"" is okay? But let's check positions:
  M A N G O -> A is in position 2 (okay, not 3), N is in position 3 (okay, not 4). 
But we also have to consider that the word must be valid. However, note that the feedback for the first guess said A and N are present, so we must include them.

But wait: ""MANGO"" has the letter O and G, which we haven't tested. However, we are allowed to use any letters except C, R, E.

But is ""MANGO"" a valid word? Yes.

But we can do better: we want to test more common letters. Also, we have two new letters: M and G and O. That's three new letters. But we might want to test more frequent letters.

Another candidate: ""STAND""
  S T A N D -> 
    A is in position 3? -> but we cannot put A in position 3. So invalid.

""TALON"": 
  T A L O N -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  Letters: T, A, L, O, N -> includes A and N, and new letters T, L, O. 
  Avoids C, R, E.

But note: we have two positions for A and N that are acceptable.

Another candidate: ""ALONG""
  A L O N G -> 
    A in position 1 (okay), N in position 4 -> but we cannot put N in position 4 (because in CRANE it was in 4 and was wrong). So invalid.

""ADMIN"": 
  A D M I N -> 
    A in position 1 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  Letters: A, D, M, I, N -> new letters D, M, I.

But we might prefer more common letters.

""DAUNT"": 
  D A U N T -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 4 -> not allowed (position 4 for N is invalid).

""NASTY"": 
  N A S T Y -> 
    N in position 1 (okay), A in position 2 (okay). 
  But note: we have to be cautious because we are putting N at the start and A at position 2. 
  This word uses S, T, Y as new letters.

This seems acceptable.

But let's check: 
  In ""NASTY"": 
    N is in position 1 (which is new, since previously N was in 4 and now we are trying 1)
    A is in position 2 (previously was in 3, now 2 is new)

So ""NASTY"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" we already saw is invalid because of N in 4.

""OCTAN"" -> but O is allowed? Yes, but it has C? C is not allowed (we know C is absent). So invalid.

""LANTS"" -> not a common word? Actually, we need a valid English word. ""LANT"" is not common, but ""SLANT"" is.

""SLANT"": 
  S L A N T -> 
    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because in CRANE, A was in 3 and it was wrong position, so it cannot be in 3 again). 
  So invalid.

""TAKEN"" -> but E is not allowed? We know E is absent, so we cannot use E. So invalid.

""TANGO"": 
  T A N G O -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 3 (okay). 
  This uses T, G, O.

But note: we are putting N in position 3, which is new (previously it was in 4). So that's acceptable.

However, we have two candidates: ""NASTY"" and ""TANGO"". 

We want to maximize information. In ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1 and A at position 2, and also S, T, Y. In ""TANGO"", we are testing T, A, N, G, O.

We also note that we have two letters we know are in the word (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions and also discover other letters.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated, such as S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

But we must avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.

Let me try to list words that have A and N, without C, R, E, and with A not in 3 and N not in 4.

- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> A in 2 (okay), but no N? We must include N. So invalid.

- ""PAINS"": P A I N S -> A in 2 (okay), N in 4 -> not allowed.

- ""MAINS"": same issue, N in 4.

- ""SAUNA"": S A U N A -> A in 2 and 5, N in 4 -> N in 4 is not allowed.

- ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses B, J, O.

But J is not very common. We might get less information.

- ""WAGON"": W A G O N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses W, G, O.

- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses H, D, Y.

- ""PANSY"": P A N S Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses P, S, Y.

""PANSY"" seems good: 
  Positions: 
    P (1), A (2), N (3), S (4), Y (5)
  A is in 2 (new, not 3) -> okay
  N is in 3 (new, not 4) -> okay
  We are testing P, S, Y which are common.

But note: we are putting N in position 3. Is that acceptable? Yes, because the feedback only said that N is not in position 4, but it could be in 3.

Similarly, A is in 2, which is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""NADIR"": but R is not allowed? We know R is absent. So invalid.

""LATIN"": L A T I N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses L, T, I.

But we don't have the letter S? We might want to test S because it's very common.

We have to choose one.

I think ""PANSY"" is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (P, S, Y) and places A and N in new positions.

Alternatively, ""NASTY"" is also good: 
  N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. 
  This tests N at the start (which we haven't tried) and A in 2, and also S, T, Y.

But note: in ""NASTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and N in position 1. We know that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4. So positions 1 and 2 for N and A are both new.

However, we are using two positions that we haven't tested for A and N. 

But we have to be cautious: if we put both A and N in new positions, we might get more information about their correct positions.

But also, we are testing three new letters: S, T, Y.

Similarly, ""PANSY"" tests P, S, Y and puts A in 2 and N in 3.

I think both are reasonable. But let me see which one covers more common letters.

The frequency of letters in English words (for 5-letter words) might help. Common letters: S, T, L, N (but we already know N), A (we know A), then P, O, I, etc.

S and T are very common. So both ""NASTY"" and ""PANSY"" have S and T? Actually, ""PANSY"" has S and Y, but not T. ""NASTY"" has S, T, and Y.

So ""NASTY"" tests T as well, which is more common than P.

Therefore, I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.

But wait: in ""NASTY"", we are putting N in position 1. We don't know if that is correct. Similarly, A in position 2. But that's the point: we are testing these positions.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put A and N in adjacent positions to get more positional information.

But I think ""NASTY"" is a solid choice.

Another candidate: ""STAIN"" -> 
  S T A I N -> 
    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.

""SATIN"": 
  S A T I N -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  This uses S, T, I.

But note: we are putting A in 2 and N in 5. This is acceptable.

And we are testing S, T, I.

But we are not testing Y? That's okay. We can test Y later.

""SATIN"" is also a good candidate because it uses very common letters.

But we already know that A and N are in the word, so we are focusing on finding their positions and discovering other letters.

Between ""NASTY"" and ""SATIN"", which one?

""NASTY"": tests N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.
""SATIN"": tests S in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, N in 5.

We know that A is not in 3, so in ""SATIN"", T is in 3 and that's a new letter in that position. Also, we are testing I.

But note: we have no information about I, so it's good to test.

However, in ""NASTY"", we are testing Y which is less common than I? Actually, I is more common.

But we are also testing T in both. 

I think ""SATIN"" might be better because it uses I (a common vowel) and avoids putting two known letters (A and N) in the first two positions, which might be less likely? Not necessarily.

But let's consider: we have two known letters (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions. In ""SATIN"", we are putting A in 2 and N in 5, which are two different positions. In ""NASTY"", we are putting both at the front.

We might get more information if we spread them out.

But I don't have a strong preference.

Another candidate: ""POINT"" -> but we must include A and N? We cannot leave out A or N because we know they are in the word. So we must include both.

Therefore, we must choose a word that contains both A and N.

After considering, I think ""SATIN"" is a good choice because:
- It uses common letters: S, A, T, I, N.
- It places A in position 2 (which is new) and N in position 5 (which is new, since previously N was in 4).
- It tests the vowel I, which is common.

Alternatively, ""TAINT"" -> but T is repeated? We want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information. ""TAINT"" has two T's. So not ideal.

""SAINT"" is invalid because N is in 4.

So I'll go with ""SATIN"".

But let me confirm: 
  S A T I N
  A is in position 2 (which is not 3, so okay)
  N is in position 5 (which is not 4, so okay)

And the word is valid.

We are testing S, T, I, and we already know A and N are present.

So we can get information about S, T, I and the positions of A and N.

Therefore, I choose ""SATIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are absent from the secret word.
- A and N are present but not in positions 3 or 4 (as indicated by the ""-"" symbols).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N (since they are in the secret word).
- Must exclude C, R, and E (since they are absent).
- A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4 (to avoid repeating invalid positions).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O) to maximize information.

After evaluating options:
- ""SATIN"" is chosen because:
  - Contains A (position 2) and N (position 5), both in new valid positions.
  - Tests new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I.
  - Avoids repeated letters and excluded letters (C, R, E).
  - Provides broad positional coverage for A and N while probing new consonants and a vowel.

<thinking>
Feedback from first guess: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
- Absent letters: C, R, E
- Present letters: A, N (but not in positions 3 or 4)
- A must be in a new position (not 3): valid positions are 1, 2, 4, 5.
- N must be in a new position (not 4): valid positions are 1, 2, 3, 5.

Goal for second guess:
- Include A and N in new positions.
- Exclude C, R, E.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O, D, M, P, Y).

Evaluated candidates:
- ""PLANT"": Invalid (A in position 3, which is disallowed).
- ""PAINT"": Invalid (N in position 4, disallowed).
- ""NASTY"": Valid (A in 2, N in 1; tests S, T, Y), but places A and N adjacently, potentially limiting positional info.
- ""TANGO"": Valid (A in 2, N in 3; tests T, G, O), but G is less common.
- ""SATIN"": Valid (A in 2, N in 5; tests S, T, I). Spreads A and N apart, tests high-frequency letters (S, T, I), and avoids redundancy.

""SATIN"" is optimal:
- Tests 3 new letters (S, T, I) with high information value.
- Positions A and N in untried slots (A in 2, N in 5).
- Complies with all constraints.

<guess>SATIN</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SATIN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) T(x) I(x) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the second guess ""SATIN"":
  S: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is in position 2)
  T: x (not in the word)
  I: x (not in the word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word has A in the second position (position 2).
- The letter N is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in SATIN and marked as wrong position).
- The letters S, T, I are not in the word.
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know C, R, E are not in the word, and A is in the word (now we know it's in position 2) and N is in the word (but not in position 4 or 5).

Summary of absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I
Present letters: A (fixed at position 2), N (present but not in position 4 or 5)

Now, we must choose a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Includes N (but not in position 4 or 5, so positions 1, 2, or 3; but position 2 is taken by A, so N can be in 1 or 3).
- Does not include C, R, E, S, T, I.

We also want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

The secret word has 5 letters. We know one of them is A in position 2, and one is N (in position 1 or 3). So we have three more letters to discover.

Common letters not yet tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Since N can only be in position 1 or 3, we can consider two cases.

Let's try to form words with A in position 2 and N in position 1 or 3.

First, if N is in position 1:
  N _ A _ _ 
The third position is open, and then two more letters.

Second, if N is in position 3:
  _ _ N A _ 
But note: the second position is A, so if N is in position 3, then the word has: [letter1] A N [letter4] [letter5]

We don't know which case, so we might want to choose a word that tests one of these and also tests new letters.

But note: we have to include N, so we must choose one of the positions for N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 1 or 3 and also includes other new letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, try N in position 1:
  N _ A _ _ 
We need to fill the second blank (position 2 is A, so that's fixed) and positions 4 and 5.

But position 2 is A, so the word is: N A _ _ _

We need to choose three letters for positions 3,4,5, avoiding C,R,E,S,T,I and including N only once (since we don't have information about duplicates, but we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we don't know, but we haven't seen duplicates so we can assume none until we have evidence).

But note: the feedback for SATIN had N in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out that N might appear twice, but it's less likely. We'll assume no duplicates for efficiency.

So, for N in position 1: word pattern: N A _ _ _

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with letters that are not C,R,E,S,T,I and are not N (since we assume no duplicate).

Possible words:
- ""NAVAL"": but V and L are allowed? Yes, but let's check: N A V A L -> but A is repeated? We have A in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if A is repeated. The feedback for CRANE had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean there isn't another A. However, in SATIN, we had A in position 2 and it was correct, and no other A. But we don't know. To be safe, we should avoid assuming no duplicates for A? Actually, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we can try.

But let's see: in ""NAVAL"", we have A in position 2 (correct) and also in position 4. But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we are trying to guess, so it's acceptable. But we are also testing V and L.

But note: we are putting N in position 1, which is a possibility.

Another word: ""NADIR"" -> but R is absent (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.

""NASTY"" -> but S and T are absent, so invalid.

""NABOB"" -> B and O, but not a common word? And we have two B's? ""NABOB"" is a word, but we are testing B and O.

But we want common words.

""NAHAL"" -> not common.

""NAKED"" -> E is absent, so invalid.

""NAPPY"" -> P and Y. Word: N A P P Y -> but P repeated? And we are testing P and Y.

But we don't know if P is in the word.

Another word: ""NAVAL"" as above.

But let's consider the other case: N in position 3.

Pattern: _ _ N A _ 
That is: [letter1] A N [letter4] [letter5]  (since position 2 is A, position 3 is N)

So the word: ? A N ? ?

We need to choose letters for positions 1,4,5, avoiding C,R,E,S,T,I.

Possible words:
- ""BANAL"": B A N A L -> but A repeated? And we are testing B and L.
- ""CANAL"" -> C is absent, invalid.
- ""DANDY"" -> D and Y. Word: D A N D Y -> D repeated? And we are testing D and Y.
- ""FANCY"" -> F and C? C is absent, invalid.
- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> tests H, D, Y. No duplicates. This seems good.
- ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.
- ""PANDA"": P A N D A -> A repeated, and D.
- ""WANLY"": W A N L Y -> tests W, L, Y.

We have two main cases: N in position 1 (pattern N A _ _ _) or N in position 3 (pattern _ A N _ _).

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and tests new letters.

But note: we don't know which pattern is correct, so we might want to choose a word that helps distinguish between these cases and also tests new letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in one of the allowed positions and tests multiple new common letters.

Given that we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's list the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, and others.

We have 3 or 4 new letters to test (depending on the pattern).

But note: in the pattern for N in position 1, we have three blanks (positions 3,4,5). In the pattern for N in position 3, we have three blanks (positions 1,4,5). So in both cases, we have three new letters to find.

We can try to use a word that has N in position 1 or 3 and includes three new common letters.

But we must decide the position for N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix N to one position but tests both possibilities? That might be hard.

We know N must be in position 1 or 3. So we can choose a word that has N in one of these positions and then see the feedback.

I think it's better to pick one case and test it.

But which one? We don't have information to prefer one over the other.

We can choose a word that tests N in position 1 and also tests common letters, and if it's wrong, then N must be in position 3.

Similarly, we can do the opposite.

But we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has N in position 3 and also tests letters that are common, and then we can get information about the other positions.

Let me try to choose ""HANDY"": 
  H A N D Y
  This assumes N is in position 3 (so pattern _ A N _ _) and tests H, D, Y.

But if N is actually in position 1, then this word would not have N in position 3 and we would get feedback that N is not in the word? But we know N is in the word, so if we put N in position 3 and it's not there, then the feedback for N would be '-' (wrong position) or 'x' if it's not in the word at all? But we know it is in the word, so if we put it in position 3 and it's not there, it would be '-'. But we already know it's not in position 4 or 5, so if it's not in 3, then it must be in 1.

So by putting N in position 3, we can confirm if it is there or not.

Similarly, if we put N in position 1, we can see if it is there.

So let's choose a word that puts N in one of the positions, say position 3, and tests new letters.

I'll go with ""HANDY"": 
  H A N D Y
  - Position 1: H (new)
  - Position 2: A (correct, we know)
  - Position 3: N (we are testing if it is here)
  - Position 4: D (new)
  - Position 5: Y (new)

If N is in position 3, then we get a check for N. If not, then we get a '-' for N and we know it must be in position 1.

Additionally, we test H, D, Y.

But note: we are using a pattern that requires position 3 to be N. If it's not, then we know N is in 1.

But we are also testing three new letters.

Another candidate: ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.

But ""HANDY"" seems fine.

We could also test more common letters. For example, ""PANSY"" but S is absent, so invalid.

""BALDY"" -> B A L D Y -> but this doesn't have N? We must include N. So invalid.

We must include N.

So ""HANDY"" is a valid choice.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more common letters.

Common letters: L, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

What about ""ALONG""? But we don't have N in position 1 or 3? ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> but A is in position 1? But we need A in position 2. So invalid.

""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but I is absent, and also N is in position 5? But we know N is not in position 5 (from SATIN feedback: N in position 5 was wrong). So we cannot put N in 5. Also, I is absent.

""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> but T is absent, and N is in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4 (from CRANE: N in 4 was wrong). So invalid.

""LAUND"" -> not a word.

So ""HANDY"" seems reasonable.

Another option: ""BANAL"" -> B A N A L -> but A repeated? And we are testing B and L. But if there is no second A, then it might not be good. But we don't know.

""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> A repeated.

I think ""HANDY"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""HANDY"".Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from SATIN).
- N is present but not in position 5 (from SATIN) and not in position 4 (from CRANE), so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I.

Strategy for the next guess:
- Must include A in position 2 and N in either position 1 or 3.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., D, H, L, M, O, P, Y) while avoiding absent letters.

Chosen word: ""HANDY""
- Structure: H (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), N (position 3, testing if N is here), D (position 4), Y (position 5).
- Tests N in position 3 (if correct, we get confirmation; if not, N must be in position 1).
- Tests three new letters: H, D, Y (all common and untested).

<thinking>
Feedback from previous guesses:
1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x) → A and N present, but not in positions 3 and 4.
2. SATIN: S(x), A(✓), T(x), I(x), N(-) → A confirmed in position 2; N present but not in position 5; S, T, I absent.

Thus:
- A is fixed at position 2.
- N must be in position 1 or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are invalid per feedback).
- Absent letters: C, E, R, S, T, I.

""HANDY"" is selected because:
- Complies with A in position 2.
- Places N in position 3 (one of the two possible positions).
- Tests new letters H, D, Y (high value for information gain).
- If N is in position 3, we get confirmation; if not, we learn N must be in position 1.
- Avoids all absent letters and repeats.
</thinking>

<guess>HANDY</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(absent).  
- **Guess 2 (SATIN)**: S(absent), A(correct position), T(absent), I(absent), N(present but wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
- **A** is confirmed in **position 2** (from SATIN's ✓).
- **N** is present but **not in position 4** (from CRANE) or **position 5** (from SATIN), so it must be in **position 1 or 3**.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I (cannot be used).
- **Present letters**: A (fixed at position 2), N (must be in position 1 or 3).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **N in position 3** (to resolve its location—if not here, it must be in position 1).
- Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., **D, H, Y**) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters and respect A's fixed position.

### Chosen Guess: **HANDY**
- **H** (position 1): New letter test.
- **A** (position 2): Fixed (✓).
- **N** (position 3): Tests if N is here (if not, N must be in position 1).
- **D** (position 4): New letter test.
- **Y** (position 5): New letter test.

This guess efficiently narrows down N's position while probing three new common letters.

Actually: \n      P L A N T -> A is in position 3, but in the first guess ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and we know it\'s not in that position. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.

Actually, we can only avoid C, R, E. But ""MANGO"" has O and G. However, we must avoid E? It doesn\'t have E. But wait, we are avoiding C, R, E. So ""MANGO"" is okay? But let\'s check positions:\n  M A N G O -> A is in position 2 (okay, not 3), N is in position 3 (okay, not 4). \nBut we also have to consider that the word must be valid. However, note that the feedback for the first guess said A and N are present, so we must include them.\n\nBut wait: ""MANGO"" has the letter O and G, which we haven\'t tested. However, we are allowed to use any letters except C, R, E.\n\nBut is ""MANGO"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut we can do better: we want to test more common letters.

Yes, but it has C? C is not allowed (we know C is absent). So invalid.\n\n""LANTS"" -> not a common word? Actually, we need a valid English word. ""LANT"" is not common, but ""SLANT"" is.\n\n""SLANT"": \n  S L A N T -> \n    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because in CRANE, A was in 3 and it was wrong position, so it cannot be in 3 again). \n  So invalid.\n\n""TAKEN"" -> but E is not allowed?

So invalid.\n\n""TANGO"": \n  T A N G O -> \n    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 3 (okay). \n  This uses T, G, O.\n\nBut note: we are putting N in position 3, which is new (previously it was in 4). So that\'s acceptable.\n\nHowever, we have two candidates: ""NASTY"" and ""TANGO"". \n\nWe want to maximize information. In ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1 and A at position 2, and also S, T, Y. In ""TANGO"", we are testing T, A, N, G, O.\n\nWe also note that we have two letters we know are in the word (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions and also discover other letters.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t eliminated, such as S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.\n\nBut we must avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.\n\nLet me try to list words that have A and N, without C, R, E, and with A not in 3 and N not in 4.\n\n- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> A in 2 (okay), but no N? We must include N. So invalid.\n\n- ""PAINS"": P A I N S -> A in 2 (okay), N in 4 -> not allowed.\n\n- ""MAINS"": same issue, N in 4.\n\n- ""SAUNA"": S A U N A -> A in 2 and 5, N in 4 -> N in 4 is not allowed.\n\n- ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses B, J, O.\n\nBut J is not very common. We might get less information.\n\n- ""WAGON"": W A G O N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses W, G, O.\n\n- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses H, D, Y.\n\n- ""PANSY"": P A N S Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses P, S, Y.\n\n""PANSY"" seems good: \n  Positions: \n    P (1), A (2), N (3), S (4), Y (5)\n  A is in 2 (new, not 3) -> okay\n  N is in 3 (new, not 4) -> okay\n  We are testing P, S, Y which are common.\n\nBut note: we are putting N in position 3. Is that acceptable? Yes, because the feedback only said that N is not in position 4, but it could be in 3.\n\nSimilarly, A is in 2, which is acceptable.\n\nAnother candidate: ""NADIR"": but R is not allowed? We know R is absent. So invalid.\n\n""LATIN"": L A T I N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses L, T, I.\n\nBut we don\'t have the letter S? We might want to test S because it\'s very common.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nI think ""PANSY"" is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (P, S, Y) and places A and N in new positions.\n\nAlternatively, ""NASTY"" is also good: \n  N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. \n  This tests N at the start (which we haven\'t tried) and A in 2, and also S, T, Y.\n\nBut note: in ""NASTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and N in position 1. We know that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4. So positions 1 and 2 for N and A are both new.\n\nHowever, we are using two positions that we haven\'t tested for A and N. \n\nBut we have to be cautious: if we put both A and N in new positions, we might get more information about their correct positions.\n\nBut also, we are testing three new letters: S, T, Y.\n\nSimilarly, ""PANSY"" tests P, S, Y and puts A in 2 and N in 3.\n\nI think both are reasonable. But let me see which one covers more common letters.\n\nThe frequency of letters in English words (for 5-letter words) might help. Common letters: S, T, L, N (but we already know N), A (we know A), then P, O, I, etc.\n\nS and T are very common. So both ""NASTY"" and ""PANSY"" have S and T? Actually, ""PANSY"" has S and Y, but not T. ""NASTY"" has S, T, and Y.\n\nSo ""NASTY"" tests T as well, which is more common than P.\n\nTherefore, I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.\n\nBut wait: in ""NASTY"", we are putting N in position 1. We don\'t know if that is correct. Similarly, A in position 2. But that\'s the point: we are testing these positions.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t put A and N in adjacent positions to get more positional information.\n\nBut I think ""NASTY"" is a solid choice.\n\nAnother candidate: ""STAIN"" -> \n  S T A I N -> \n    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.\n\n""SATIN"": \n  S A T I N -> \n    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). \n  This uses S, T, I.\n\nBut note: we are putting A in 2 and N in 5. This is acceptable.\n\nAnd we are testing S, T, I.\n\nBut we are not testing Y? That\'s okay. We can test Y later.\n\n""SATIN"" is also a good candidate because it uses very common letters.\n\nBut we already know that A and N are in the word, so we are focusing on finding their positions and discovering other letters.\n\nBetween ""NASTY"" and ""SATIN"", which one?\n\n""NASTY"": tests N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.\n""SATIN"": tests S in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, N in 5.\n\nWe know that A is not in 3, so in ""SATIN"", T is in 3 and that\'s a new letter in that position. Also, we are testing I.\n\nBut note: we have no information about I, so it\'s good to test.\n\nHowever, in ""NASTY"", we are testing Y which is less common than I? Actually, I is more common.\n\nBut we are also testing T in both. \n\nI think ""SATIN"" might be better because it uses I (a common vowel) and avoids putting two known letters (A and N) in the first two positions, which might be less likely? Not necessarily.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have two known letters (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions. In ""SATIN"", we are putting A in 2 and N in 5, which are two different positions. In ""NASTY"", we are putting both at the front.\n\nWe might get more information if we spread them out.\n\nBut I don\'t have a strong preference.\n\nAnother candidate: ""POINT"" -> but we must include A and N? We cannot leave out A or N because we know they are in the word. So we must include both.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word that contains both A and N.\n\nAfter considering, I think ""SATIN"" is a good choice because:\n- It uses common letters: S, A, T, I, N.\n- It places A in position 2 (which is new) and N in position 5 (which is new, since previously N was in 4).\n- It tests the vowel I, which is common.\n\nAlternatively, ""TAINT"" -> but T is repeated? We want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information. ""TAINT"" has two T\'s. So not ideal.\n\n""SAINT"" is invalid because N is in 4.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SATIN"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  S A T I N\n  A is in position 2 (which is not 3, so okay)\n  N is in position 5 (which is not 4, so okay)\n\nAnd the word is valid.\n\nWe are testing S, T, I, and we already know A and N are present.\n\nSo we can get information about S, T, I and the positions of A and N.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""SATIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, and E are absent from the secret word.\n- A and N are present but not in positions 3 or 4 (as indicated by the ""-"" symbols).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A and N (since they are in the secret word).\n- Must exclude C, R, and E (since they are absent).\n- A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4 (to avoid repeating invalid positions).\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O) to maximize information.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""SATIN"" is chosen because:\n  - Contains A (position 2) and N (position 5), both in new valid positions.\n  - Tests new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I.\n  - Avoids repeated letters and excluded letters (C, R, E).\n  - Provides broad positional coverage for A and N while probing new consonants and a vowel.\n\n<thinking>\nFeedback from first guess: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)\n- Absent letters: C, R, E\n- Present letters: A, N (but not in positions 3 or 4)\n- A must be in a new position (not 3): valid positions are 1, 2, 4, 5.\n- N must be in a new position (not 4): valid positions are 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\nGoal for second guess:\n- Include A and N in new positions.\n- Exclude C, R, E.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O, D, M, P, Y).\n\nEvaluated candidates:\n- ""PLANT"": Invalid (A in position 3, which is disallowed).\n- ""PAINT"": Invalid (N in position 4, disallowed).\n- ""NASTY"": Valid (A in 2, N in 1; tests S, T, Y), but places A and N adjacently, potentially limiting positional info.\n- ""TANGO"": Valid (A in 2, N in 3; tests T, G, O), but G is less common.\n- ""SATIN"": Valid (A in 2, N in 5; tests S, T, I). Spreads A and N apart, tests high-frequency letters (S, T, I), and avoids redundancy.\n\n""SATIN"" is optimal:\n- Tests 3 new letters (S, T, I) with high information value.\n- Positions A and N in untried slots (A in 2, N in 5).\n- Complies with all constraints.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>SATIN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SATIN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) T(x) I(x) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the second guess ""SATIN"":\n  S: x (not in the word)\n  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is in position 2)\n  T: x (not in the word)\n  I: x (not in the word)\n  N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word has A in the second position (position 2).\n- The letter N is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in SATIN and marked as wrong position).\n- The letters S, T, I are not in the word.\n- Additionally, from the first guess, we know C, R, E are not in the word, and A is in the word (now we know it\'s in position 2) and N is in the word (but not in position 4 or 5).\n\nSummary of absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I\nPresent letters: A (fixed at position 2), N (present but not in position 4 or 5)\n\nNow, we must choose a word that:\n- Has A in position 2.\n- Includes N (but not in position 4 or 5, so positions 1, 2, or 3; but position 2 is taken by A, so N can be in 1 or 3).\n- Does not include C, R, E, S, T, I.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.\n\nThe secret word has 5 letters.

Yes, but let\'s check: N A V A L -> but A is repeated? We have A in position 2 and 4? But we don\'t know if A is repeated. The feedback for CRANE had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t mean there isn\'t another A. However, in SATIN, we had A in position 2 and it was correct, and no other A. But we don\'t know. To be safe, we should avoid assuming no duplicates for A? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates, so we can try.\n\nBut let\'s see: in ""NAVAL"", we have A in position 2 (correct) and also in position 4. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, we are trying to guess, so it\'s acceptable. But we are also testing V and L.\n\nBut note: we are putting N in position 1, which is a possibility.\n\nAnother word: ""NADIR"" -> but R is absent (we know R is not in the word).

A N ? ?\n\nWe need to choose letters for positions 1,4,5, avoiding C,R,E,S,T,I.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BANAL"": B A N A L -> but A repeated? And we are testing B and L.\n- ""CANAL"" -> C is absent, invalid.\n- ""DANDY"" -> D and Y. Word: D A N D Y -> D repeated? And we are testing D and Y.\n- ""FANCY"" -> F and C?

This seems good.\n- ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.\n- ""PANDA"": P A N D A -> A repeated, and D.\n- ""WANLY"": W A N L Y -> tests W, L, Y.\n\nWe have two main cases: N in position 1 (pattern N A _ _ _) or N in position 3 (pattern _ A N _ _).\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and tests new letters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which pattern is correct, so we might want to choose a word that helps distinguish between these cases and also tests new letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has N in one of the allowed positions and tests multiple new common letters.\n\nGiven that we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, and others.\n\nWe have 3 or 4 new letters to test (depending on the pattern).\n\nBut note: in the pattern for N in position 1, we have three blanks (positions 3,4,5). In the pattern for N in position 3, we have three blanks (positions 1,4,5). So in both cases, we have three new letters to find.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has N in position 1 or 3 and includes three new common letters.\n\nBut we must decide the position for N.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t fix N to one position but tests both possibilities? That might be hard.\n\nWe know N must be in position 1 or 3. So we can choose a word that has N in one of these positions and then see the feedback.\n\nI think it\'s better to pick one case and test it.\n\nBut which one? We don\'t have information to prefer one over the other.\n\nWe can choose a word that tests N in position 1 and also tests common letters, and if it\'s wrong, then N must be in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, we can do the opposite.\n\nBut we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has N in position 3 and also tests letters that are common, and then we can get information about the other positions.\n\nLet me try to choose ""HANDY"": \n  H A N D Y\n  This assumes N is in position 3 (so pattern _ A N _ _) and tests H, D, Y.\n\nBut if N is actually in position 1, then this word would not have N in position 3 and we would get feedback that N is not in the word? But we know N is in the word, so if we put N in position 3 and it\'s not there, then the feedback for N would be \'-\' (wrong position) or \'x\' if it\'s not in the word at all? But we know it is in the word, so if we put it in position 3 and it\'s not there, it would be \'-\'. But we already know it\'s not in position 4 or 5, so if it\'s not in 3, then it must be in 1.\n\nSo by putting N in position 3, we can confirm if it is there or not.\n\nSimilarly, if we put N in position 1, we can see if it is there.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word that puts N in one of the positions, say position 3, and tests new letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""HANDY"": \n  H A N D Y\n  - Position 1: H (new)\n  - Position 2: A (correct, we know)\n  - Position 3: N (we are testing if it is here)\n  - Position 4: D (new)\n  - Position 5: Y (new)\n\nIf N is in position 3, then we get a check for N. If not, then we get a \'-\' for N and we know it must be in position 1.\n\nAdditionally, we test H, D, Y.\n\nBut note: we are using a pattern that requires position 3 to be N. If it\'s not, then we know N is in 1.\n\nBut we are also testing three new letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.\n\nBut ""HANDY"" seems fine.\n\nWe could also test more common letters. For example, ""PANSY"" but S is absent, so invalid.\n\n""BALDY"" -> B A L D Y -> but this doesn\'t have N? We must include N.

But we don\'t have N in position 1 or 3? ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> but A is in position 1? But we need A in position 2.

We have received feedback for the third guess ""HANDY"":
  H(x) -> not in the word
  A(✓) -> correct position (position 2) [already knew this]
  N(✓) -> correct position (position 3) [now we know N is in position 3]
  D(✓) -> correct position (position 4)
  Y(✓) -> correct position (position 5)

So, the feedback tells us:
- H is absent.
- A, N, D, Y are correct and in the positions we guessed.

Therefore, the secret word must be: 
  Position 1: ? (unknown)
  Position 2: A (correct)
  Position 3: N (correct)
  Position 4: D (correct)
  Position 5: Y (correct)

So the word pattern is: _ A N D Y

We only need to find the first letter.

Constraints:
- The first letter cannot be any of the absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, H (from HANDY feedback).
- It must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated and must form a valid English word.

We need to find words that fit the pattern _ A N D Y.

Common possibilities:
- BANDY
- CANDY -> but C is absent? From first guess: C is absent. So invalid.
- DANDY -> but D is already in position 4? And we are using Y in 5. But ""DANDY"" would be D in position 1, but we have D in position 4. Would that be allowed? Actually, we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, in our feedback, we have D marked as correct in position 4. If we put D in position 1 as well, that might be possible, but we need to check.
  But note: in ""DANDY"", we have:
    Position 1: D
    Position 2: A
    Position 3: N
    Position 4: D
    Position 5: Y

  But we already know from the pattern that position 4 is D. So if the word has another D in position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we haven't tested for duplicates before? The feedback doesn't show duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess one in the correct position and one in a wrong position, it might show accordingly. But in HANDY, we had D in position 4 and it was correct. So if we try ""DANDY"", we are putting D in position 1 and position 4. If the word has D only once (at position 4), then position 1 would get an 'x' for D? Actually, no: because we are using D in two positions. The feedback might mark the one in position 4 as correct and the one in position 1 as absent (if there's only one D). But in our case, we know D is in position 4, so if there is no other D, then the D in position 1 would be marked absent.

  We haven't eliminated D for position 1? But we know D is in the word at position 4. So if the first letter is D, then the word has two D's. But we don't know if that's the case.

  We need to test.

  Alternatively, we can try another letter.

But first, let's list possible words ending in ""ANDY"" that are 5 letters.

Possible words:
- BANDY: B A N D Y
- CANDY: C A N D Y -> but C is absent? Yes, from first guess.
- DANDY: D A N D Y -> has two D's? But possible.
- FANDY: not a word? 
- GANDY: rare? 
- HANDY: we already tried, but H is absent, and we know the word isn't HANDY because H is absent and we didn't have it correct.
- MANDY: M A N D Y -> a valid word (e.g., a name or colloquial term).
- PANDY: P A N D Y -> valid in certain dialects (to strike on the palm) or as a name.
- RANDY: R A N D Y -> but R is absent? From first guess: R is absent. So invalid.
- SANDY: S A N D Y -> but S is absent? From SATIN: S is absent. So invalid.
- WANDY: not common? 
- VANDY: as in Vandy? abbreviation for Vanderbilt? Not universally recognized.

Common choices: BANDY, MANDY, PANDY, and DANDY.

But note:
- DANDY: has two D's. We know D is at position 4. If we try D in position 1, and if the word has only one D (at position 4), then position 1 would be marked absent. But if it has two D's, then position 1 might be marked correct or wrong position? We don't know.

We have limited guesses (we are at guess 4 of 6), so we can guess one of these.

Since we have multiple options, we should choose one that tests a new letter.

We haven't tested B, M, P, etc.

We don't know which one is correct.

But note: we know the first letter cannot be H, and cannot be any of the absent letters.

We can choose a word that has a single new letter for position 1, but we must form a valid word.

Alternatively, we can just guess one of the candidates.

But we have three possibilities: B, M, P for the first letter (and D, but that has duplication).

We should try the most common one or one that gives us information.

But since we are only missing the first letter, we can guess one.

Let me see the frequency: 
- ""BANDY"" means to pass from one to another, or have legs that curve outwards. 
- ""MANDY"" is a name.
- ""PANDY"" is a Scottish term for striking on the hand, or a name.
- ""DANDY"" is a well-known word.

""DANDY"" might be the most common.

But we need to check if D is allowed in position 1? We know D is in the word at position 4, so using D in position 1 might be acceptable if duplicated.

However, to be safe, we can choose a word that introduces a new letter.

I'll go with ""BANDY"" because it uses B, which hasn't been tested, and if it's not correct, we can eliminate B.

Similarly, if we try ""MANDY"", we test M.

But we have only one letter to guess, so we can pick one.

The system expects one guess.

Given that ""DANDY"" is a valid word and quite common, and we know the pattern is _ANDY, let's choose ""DANDY"". But note that if there is only one D, then the first letter D would be marked absent, and we would know it's not D.

But we can learn from that.

Alternatively, to avoid duplication, we can pick a word that doesn't use D in position 1.

Let me list: BANDY, MANDY, PANDY.

I think ""BANDY"" is a good choice because B is a common letter.

But we are only testing the first letter.

So I'll go ahead and choose ""BANDY"".

If it's not, then we try others.

But we have other options: LANDY? but L hasn't been tested? ""LANDY"" is not a standard word. Similarly, ""WANDY"" is not common.

So the realistic options are B, M, P, D.

We can pick ""BANDY"" as it tests B.

Therefore, I choose ""BANDY"".The secret word pattern is _ANDY, with A,N,D,Y confirmed in positions 2,3,4,5 respectively.  
From feedback:  
- All absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, H  
- Present letters: A, N, D, Y (fixed in positions 2-5).  

Thus:  
- Only position 1 is unknown.  
- Possible letters: Any unused consonants/vowels except absent letters.  
- Likely candidates: **B, M, P, D, G, etc.** but must form a valid word.  

Top valid options:  
1. **BANDY** (B in position 1)  
2. **DANDY** (D in position 1; possible duplicate D)  
3. **MANDY** (M in position 1)  
4. **PANDY** (P in position 1)  

Strategy:  
- Choose **BANDY** to test a new common letter (B) and avoid duplication risk.  
- If incorrect, proceed to test M or P next.  

<guess>BANDY</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - Guess 1 (CRANE): A and N are in the word but not in positions 3/4; C, R, E absent.
   - Guess 2 (SATIN): A is confirmed in position 2; N is present but not in position 5; S/T/I absent.
   - Guess 3 (HANDY): N in position 3, D in position 4, and Y in position 5 are correct; A (position 2) reconfirmed; H absent.

2. **Current Known Information**:
   - **Secret word pattern**: `_ A N D Y` (positions 2, 3, 4, 5 confirmed as A, N, D, Y respectively).
   - **Confirmed present letters**: A, N, D, Y (fixed positions).
   - **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I, H (excluded).
   - Position 1 must be a new letter (not absent) to form a valid English word.

3. **Deduction**:
   - Only position 1 is unknown.
   - Possible words: `?ANDY` (e.g., BANDY, DANDY, MANDY, PANDY, WANDY, etc.).
   - Common valid options: 
     - **BANDY** (B in position 1).
     - **DANDY** (D in position 1; risk of duplicate D but possible).
     - **MANDY** (M in position 1).
     - **PANDY** (P in position 1).
   - Test **BANDY**:
     - Uses B, a high-frequency unused consonant.
     - Avoids ambiguity (unlike DANDY, which may have duplicate D).
     - If incorrect, eliminates B and narrows to M/P/D in subsequent guesses.

So, the feedback tells us:
- H is absent.
- A, N, D, Y are correct and in the positions we guessed.

Therefore, the secret word must be: 
  Position 1: ? (unknown)

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a strong starting word.
 A good starting word often has:
   - 5 different letters to maximize information.
   - Common letters to increase the chance of hitting some in the secret word.
 Examples of such words: ""CRANE"", ""SALET"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, my first guess is CRANE.<thinking>
I'm starting a new game with no prior guesses or feedback. For an optimal first guess in Wordle, I should use a word that:
- Contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information
- Avoids repeated letters
- Has letters that frequently appear in English words

""CRANE"" is an excellent starting word because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N)
- Uses five distinct letters
- Covers frequently used letters like R, A, and E
- Has been statistically proven effective in Wordle strategies

This first guess will help establish which letters are present/absent and potentially reveal correct positions, setting up stronger subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were in (position 3 and 4 respectively in ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and N (since they are present in the word)
- Does not include C, R, or E (since they are absent)
- Places A and N in positions different from the first guess (i.e., A cannot be in the 3rd position, N cannot be in the 4th position)

Additionally, we want to maximize information by:
- Using other common letters that haven't been tested yet (like T, O, I, S, L, etc.)
- Avoiding letters we already know are absent (C, R, E)

Let's think of words that contain A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible letters to use: We have 3 more letters to choose (since A and N are fixed). We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels: O, I, U (but we already have A, so maybe one more vowel?).

We also note that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4.

Let's try to form a word that has A and N, and also includes T, O, S, or other common letters.

Some candidate words:
- ""PLANT"": 
  - Contains A and N (and also P, L, T)
  - But note: in ""PLANT"", A is in position 3? Actually: 
      P L A N T -> A is in position 3, but in the first guess ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and we know it's not in that position. So we cannot put A in position 3 again. Therefore, ""PLANT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

- ""PAINT"": 
  - P A I N T -> A is in position 2, N is in position 4. 
  - But in the first guess, N was in position 4 and we know it's not in position 4. So we cannot put N in position 4. Therefore, ""PAINT"" is invalid.

- ""SAINT"": 
  - S A I N T -> A in position 2, N in position 4 -> again, N in position 4 is not allowed.

We need to avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

Let's try to put A in a new position and N in a new position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (since not 3)
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (since not 4)

Another candidate: ""MANGO"" -> but we cannot use E? Actually, we can only avoid C, R, E. But ""MANGO"" has O and G. However, we must avoid E? It doesn't have E. But wait, we are avoiding C, R, E. So ""MANGO"" is okay? But let's check positions:
  M A N G O -> A is in position 2 (okay, not 3), N is in position 3 (okay, not 4). 
But we also have to consider that the word must be valid. However, note that the feedback for the first guess said A and N are present, so we must include them.

But wait: ""MANGO"" has the letter O and G, which we haven't tested. However, we are allowed to use any letters except C, R, E.

But is ""MANGO"" a valid word? Yes.

But we can do better: we want to test more common letters. Also, we have two new letters: M and G and O. That's three new letters. But we might want to test more frequent letters.

Another candidate: ""STAND""
  S T A N D -> 
    A is in position 3? -> but we cannot put A in position 3. So invalid.

""TALON"": 
  T A L O N -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  Letters: T, A, L, O, N -> includes A and N, and new letters T, L, O. 
  Avoids C, R, E.

But note: we have two positions for A and N that are acceptable.

Another candidate: ""ALONG""
  A L O N G -> 
    A in position 1 (okay), N in position 4 -> but we cannot put N in position 4 (because in CRANE it was in 4 and was wrong). So invalid.

""ADMIN"": 
  A D M I N -> 
    A in position 1 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  Letters: A, D, M, I, N -> new letters D, M, I.

But we might prefer more common letters.

""DAUNT"": 
  D A U N T -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 4 -> not allowed (position 4 for N is invalid).

""NASTY"": 
  N A S T Y -> 
    N in position 1 (okay), A in position 2 (okay). 
  But note: we have to be cautious because we are putting N at the start and A at position 2. 
  This word uses S, T, Y as new letters.

This seems acceptable.

But let's check: 
  In ""NASTY"": 
    N is in position 1 (which is new, since previously N was in 4 and now we are trying 1)
    A is in position 2 (previously was in 3, now 2 is new)

So ""NASTY"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" we already saw is invalid because of N in 4.

""OCTAN"" -> but O is allowed? Yes, but it has C? C is not allowed (we know C is absent). So invalid.

""LANTS"" -> not a common word? Actually, we need a valid English word. ""LANT"" is not common, but ""SLANT"" is.

""SLANT"": 
  S L A N T -> 
    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because in CRANE, A was in 3 and it was wrong position, so it cannot be in 3 again). 
  So invalid.

""TAKEN"" -> but E is not allowed? We know E is absent, so we cannot use E. So invalid.

""TANGO"": 
  T A N G O -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 3 (okay). 
  This uses T, G, O.

But note: we are putting N in position 3, which is new (previously it was in 4). So that's acceptable.

However, we have two candidates: ""NASTY"" and ""TANGO"". 

We want to maximize information. In ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1 and A at position 2, and also S, T, Y. In ""TANGO"", we are testing T, A, N, G, O.

We also note that we have two letters we know are in the word (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions and also discover other letters.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated, such as S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

But we must avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.

Let me try to list words that have A and N, without C, R, E, and with A not in 3 and N not in 4.

- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> A in 2 (okay), but no N? We must include N. So invalid.

- ""PAINS"": P A I N S -> A in 2 (okay), N in 4 -> not allowed.

- ""MAINS"": same issue, N in 4.

- ""SAUNA"": S A U N A -> A in 2 and 5, N in 4 -> N in 4 is not allowed.

- ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses B, J, O.

But J is not very common. We might get less information.

- ""WAGON"": W A G O N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses W, G, O.

- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses H, D, Y.

- ""PANSY"": P A N S Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses P, S, Y.

""PANSY"" seems good: 
  Positions: 
    P (1), A (2), N (3), S (4), Y (5)
  A is in 2 (new, not 3) -> okay
  N is in 3 (new, not 4) -> okay
  We are testing P, S, Y which are common.

But note: we are putting N in position 3. Is that acceptable? Yes, because the feedback only said that N is not in position 4, but it could be in 3.

Similarly, A is in 2, which is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""NADIR"": but R is not allowed? We know R is absent. So invalid.

""LATIN"": L A T I N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses L, T, I.

But we don't have the letter S? We might want to test S because it's very common.

We have to choose one.

I think ""PANSY"" is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (P, S, Y) and places A and N in new positions.

Alternatively, ""NASTY"" is also good: 
  N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. 
  This tests N at the start (which we haven't tried) and A in 2, and also S, T, Y.

But note: in ""NASTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and N in position 1. We know that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4. So positions 1 and 2 for N and A are both new.

However, we are using two positions that we haven't tested for A and N. 

But we have to be cautious: if we put both A and N in new positions, we might get more information about their correct positions.

But also, we are testing three new letters: S, T, Y.

Similarly, ""PANSY"" tests P, S, Y and puts A in 2 and N in 3.

I think both are reasonable. But let me see which one covers more common letters.

The frequency of letters in English words (for 5-letter words) might help. Common letters: S, T, L, N (but we already know N), A (we know A), then P, O, I, etc.

S and T are very common. So both ""NASTY"" and ""PANSY"" have S and T? Actually, ""PANSY"" has S and Y, but not T. ""NASTY"" has S, T, and Y.

So ""NASTY"" tests T as well, which is more common than P.

Therefore, I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.

But wait: in ""NASTY"", we are putting N in position 1. We don't know if that is correct. Similarly, A in position 2. But that's the point: we are testing these positions.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put A and N in adjacent positions to get more positional information.

But I think ""NASTY"" is a solid choice.

Another candidate: ""STAIN"" -> 
  S T A I N -> 
    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.

""SATIN"": 
  S A T I N -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  This uses S, T, I.

But note: we are putting A in 2 and N in 5. This is acceptable.

And we are testing S, T, I.

But we are not testing Y? That's okay. We can test Y later.

""SATIN"" is also a good candidate because it uses very common letters.

But we already know that A and N are in the word, so we are focusing on finding their positions and discovering other letters.

Between ""NASTY"" and ""SATIN"", which one?

""NASTY"": tests N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.
""SATIN"": tests S in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, N in 5.

We know that A is not in 3, so in ""SATIN"", T is in 3 and that's a new letter in that position. Also, we are testing I.

But note: we have no information about I, so it's good to test.

However, in ""NASTY"", we are testing Y which is less common than I? Actually, I is more common.

But we are also testing T in both. 

I think ""SATIN"" might be better because it uses I (a common vowel) and avoids putting two known letters (A and N) in the first two positions, which might be less likely? Not necessarily.

But let's consider: we have two known letters (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions. In ""SATIN"", we are putting A in 2 and N in 5, which are two different positions. In ""NASTY"", we are putting both at the front.

We might get more information if we spread them out.

But I don't have a strong preference.

Another candidate: ""POINT"" -> but we must include A and N? We cannot leave out A or N because we know they are in the word. So we must include both.

Therefore, we must choose a word that contains both A and N.

After considering, I think ""SATIN"" is a good choice because:
- It uses common letters: S, A, T, I, N.
- It places A in position 2 (which is new) and N in position 5 (which is new, since previously N was in 4).
- It tests the vowel I, which is common.

Alternatively, ""TAINT"" -> but T is repeated? We want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information. ""TAINT"" has two T's. So not ideal.

""SAINT"" is invalid because N is in 4.

So I'll go with ""SATIN"".

But let me confirm: 
  S A T I N
  A is in position 2 (which is not 3, so okay)
  N is in position 5 (which is not 4, so okay)

And the word is valid.

We are testing S, T, I, and we already know A and N are present.

So we can get information about S, T, I and the positions of A and N.

Therefore, I choose ""SATIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are absent from the secret word.
- A and N are present but not in positions 3 or 4 (as indicated by the ""-"" symbols).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N (since they are in the secret word).
- Must exclude C, R, and E (since they are absent).
- A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4 (to avoid repeating invalid positions).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O) to maximize information.

After evaluating options:
- ""SATIN"" is chosen because:
  - Contains A (position 2) and N (position 5), both in new valid positions.
  - Tests new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I.
  - Avoids repeated letters and excluded letters (C, R, E).
  - Provides broad positional coverage for A and N while probing new consonants and a vowel.

<thinking>
Feedback from first guess: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
- Absent letters: C, R, E
- Present letters: A, N (but not in positions 3 or 4)
- A must be in a new position (not 3): valid positions are 1, 2, 4, 5.
- N must be in a new position (not 4): valid positions are 1, 2, 3, 5.

Goal for second guess:
- Include A and N in new positions.
- Exclude C, R, E.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O, D, M, P, Y).

Evaluated candidates:
- ""PLANT"": Invalid (A in position 3, which is disallowed).
- ""PAINT"": Invalid (N in position 4, disallowed).
- ""NASTY"": Valid (A in 2, N in 1; tests S, T, Y), but places A and N adjacently, potentially limiting positional info.
- ""TANGO"": Valid (A in 2, N in 3; tests T, G, O), but G is less common.
- ""SATIN"": Valid (A in 2, N in 5; tests S, T, I). Spreads A and N apart, tests high-frequency letters (S, T, I), and avoids redundancy.

""SATIN"" is optimal:
- Tests 3 new letters (S, T, I) with high information value.
- Positions A and N in untried slots (A in 2, N in 5).
- Complies with all constraints.

<guess>SATIN</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SATIN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) T(x) I(x) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the second guess ""SATIN"":
  S: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is in position 2)
  T: x (not in the word)
  I: x (not in the word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word has A in the second position (position 2).
- The letter N is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in SATIN and marked as wrong position).
- The letters S, T, I are not in the word.
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know C, R, E are not in the word, and A is in the word (now we know it's in position 2) and N is in the word (but not in position 4 or 5).

Summary of absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I
Present letters: A (fixed at position 2), N (present but not in position 4 or 5)

Now, we must choose a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Includes N (but not in position 4 or 5, so positions 1, 2, or 3; but position 2 is taken by A, so N can be in 1 or 3).
- Does not include C, R, E, S, T, I.

We also want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

The secret word has 5 letters. We know one of them is A in position 2, and one is N (in position 1 or 3). So we have three more letters to discover.

Common letters not yet tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Since N can only be in position 1 or 3, we can consider two cases.

Let's try to form words with A in position 2 and N in position 1 or 3.

First, if N is in position 1:
  N _ A _ _ 
The third position is open, and then two more letters.

Second, if N is in position 3:
  _ _ N A _ 
But note: the second position is A, so if N is in position 3, then the word has: [letter1] A N [letter4] [letter5]

We don't know which case, so we might want to choose a word that tests one of these and also tests new letters.

But note: we have to include N, so we must choose one of the positions for N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 1 or 3 and also includes other new letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, try N in position 1:
  N _ A _ _ 
We need to fill the second blank (position 2 is A, so that's fixed) and positions 4 and 5.

But position 2 is A, so the word is: N A _ _ _

We need to choose three letters for positions 3,4,5, avoiding C,R,E,S,T,I and including N only once (since we don't have information about duplicates, but we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we don't know, but we haven't seen duplicates so we can assume none until we have evidence).

But note: the feedback for SATIN had N in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out that N might appear twice, but it's less likely. We'll assume no duplicates for efficiency.

So, for N in position 1: word pattern: N A _ _ _

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with letters that are not C,R,E,S,T,I and are not N (since we assume no duplicate).

Possible words:
- ""NAVAL"": but V and L are allowed? Yes, but let's check: N A V A L -> but A is repeated? We have A in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if A is repeated. The feedback for CRANE had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean there isn't another A. However, in SATIN, we had A in position 2 and it was correct, and no other A. But we don't know. To be safe, we should avoid assuming no duplicates for A? Actually, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we can try.

But let's see: in ""NAVAL"", we have A in position 2 (correct) and also in position 4. But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we are trying to guess, so it's acceptable. But we are also testing V and L.

But note: we are putting N in position 1, which is a possibility.

Another word: ""NADIR"" -> but R is absent (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.

""NASTY"" -> but S and T are absent, so invalid.

""NABOB"" -> B and O, but not a common word? And we have two B's? ""NABOB"" is a word, but we are testing B and O.

But we want common words.

""NAHAL"" -> not common.

""NAKED"" -> E is absent, so invalid.

""NAPPY"" -> P and Y. Word: N A P P Y -> but P repeated? And we are testing P and Y.

But we don't know if P is in the word.

Another word: ""NAVAL"" as above.

But let's consider the other case: N in position 3.

Pattern: _ _ N A _ 
That is: [letter1] A N [letter4] [letter5]  (since position 2 is A, position 3 is N)

So the word: ? A N ? ?

We need to choose letters for positions 1,4,5, avoiding C,R,E,S,T,I.

Possible words:
- ""BANAL"": B A N A L -> but A repeated? And we are testing B and L.
- ""CANAL"" -> C is absent, invalid.
- ""DANDY"" -> D and Y. Word: D A N D Y -> D repeated? And we are testing D and Y.
- ""FANCY"" -> F and C? C is absent, invalid.
- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> tests H, D, Y. No duplicates. This seems good.
- ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.
- ""PANDA"": P A N D A -> A repeated, and D.
- ""WANLY"": W A N L Y -> tests W, L, Y.

We have two main cases: N in position 1 (pattern N A _ _ _) or N in position 3 (pattern _ A N _ _).

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and tests new letters.

But note: we don't know which pattern is correct, so we might want to choose a word that helps distinguish between these cases and also tests new letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in one of the allowed positions and tests multiple new common letters.

Given that we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's list the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, and others.

We have 3 or 4 new letters to test (depending on the pattern).

But note: in the pattern for N in position 1, we have three blanks (positions 3,4,5). In the pattern for N in position 3, we have three blanks (positions 1,4,5). So in both cases, we have three new letters to find.

We can try to use a word that has N in position 1 or 3 and includes three new common letters.

But we must decide the position for N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix N to one position but tests both possibilities? That might be hard.

We know N must be in position 1 or 3. So we can choose a word that has N in one of these positions and then see the feedback.

I think it's better to pick one case and test it.

But which one? We don't have information to prefer one over the other.

We can choose a word that tests N in position 1 and also tests common letters, and if it's wrong, then N must be in position 3.

Similarly, we can do the opposite.

But we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has N in position 3 and also tests letters that are common, and then we can get information about the other positions.

Let me try to choose ""HANDY"": 
  H A N D Y
  This assumes N is in position 3 (so pattern _ A N _ _) and tests H, D, Y.

But if N is actually in position 1, then this word would not have N in position 3 and we would get feedback that N is not in the word? But we know N is in the word, so if we put N in position 3 and it's not there, then the feedback for N would be '-' (wrong position) or 'x' if it's not in the word at all? But we know it is in the word, so if we put it in position 3 and it's not there, it would be '-'. But we already know it's not in position 4 or 5, so if it's not in 3, then it must be in 1.

So by putting N in position 3, we can confirm if it is there or not.

Similarly, if we put N in position 1, we can see if it is there.

So let's choose a word that puts N in one of the positions, say position 3, and tests new letters.

I'll go with ""HANDY"": 
  H A N D Y
  - Position 1: H (new)
  - Position 2: A (correct, we know)
  - Position 3: N (we are testing if it is here)
  - Position 4: D (new)
  - Position 5: Y (new)

If N is in position 3, then we get a check for N. If not, then we get a '-' for N and we know it must be in position 1.

Additionally, we test H, D, Y.

But note: we are using a pattern that requires position 3 to be N. If it's not, then we know N is in 1.

But we are also testing three new letters.

Another candidate: ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.

But ""HANDY"" seems fine.

We could also test more common letters. For example, ""PANSY"" but S is absent, so invalid.

""BALDY"" -> B A L D Y -> but this doesn't have N? We must include N. So invalid.

We must include N.

So ""HANDY"" is a valid choice.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more common letters.

Common letters: L, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

What about ""ALONG""? But we don't have N in position 1 or 3? ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> but A is in position 1? But we need A in position 2. So invalid.

""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but I is absent, and also N is in position 5? But we know N is not in position 5 (from SATIN feedback: N in position 5 was wrong). So we cannot put N in 5. Also, I is absent.

""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> but T is absent, and N is in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4 (from CRANE: N in 4 was wrong). So invalid.

""LAUND"" -> not a word.

So ""HANDY"" seems reasonable.

Another option: ""BANAL"" -> B A N A L -> but A repeated? And we are testing B and L. But if there is no second A, then it might not be good. But we don't know.

""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> A repeated.

I think ""HANDY"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""HANDY"".Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from SATIN).
- N is present but not in position 5 (from SATIN) and not in position 4 (from CRANE), so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I.

Strategy for the next guess:
- Must include A in position 2 and N in either position 1 or 3.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., D, H, L, M, O, P, Y) while avoiding absent letters.

Chosen word: ""HANDY""
- Structure: H (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), N (position 3, testing if N is here), D (position 4), Y (position 5).
- Tests N in position 3 (if correct, we get confirmation; if not, N must be in position 1).
- Tests three new letters: H, D, Y (all common and untested).

<thinking>
Feedback from previous guesses:
1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x) → A and N present, but not in positions 3 and 4.
2. SATIN: S(x), A(✓), T(x), I(x), N(-) → A confirmed in position 2; N present but not in position 5; S, T, I absent.

Thus:
- A is fixed at position 2.
- N must be in position 1 or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are invalid per feedback).
- Absent letters: C, E, R, S, T, I.

""HANDY"" is selected because:
- Complies with A in position 2.
- Places N in position 3 (one of the two possible positions).
- Tests new letters H, D, Y (high value for information gain).
- If N is in position 3, we get confirmation; if not, we learn N must be in position 1.
- Avoids all absent letters and repeats.
</thinking>

<guess>HANDY</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(absent).  
- **Guess 2 (SATIN)**: S(absent), A(correct position), T(absent), I(absent), N(present but wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
- **A** is confirmed in **position 2** (from SATIN's ✓).
- **N** is present but **not in position 4** (from CRANE) or **position 5** (from SATIN), so it must be in **position 1 or 3**.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I (cannot be used).
- **Present letters**: A (fixed at position 2), N (must be in position 1 or 3).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **N in position 3** (to resolve its location—if not here, it must be in position 1).
- Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., **D, H, Y**) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters and respect A's fixed position.

### Chosen Guess: **HANDY**
- **H** (position 1): New letter test.
- **A** (position 2): Fixed (✓).
- **N** (position 3): Tests if N is here (if not, N must be in position 1).
- **D** (position 4): New letter test.
- **Y** (position 5): New letter test.

This guess efficiently narrows down N's position while probing three new common letters.

<guess>HANDY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SATIN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) T(x) I(x) N(-)
Guess 3: HANDY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have received feedback for the third guess ""HANDY"":
  H(x) -> not in the word
  A(✓) -> correct position (position 2) [already knew this]
  N(✓) -> correct position (position 3) [now we know N is in position 3]
  D(✓) -> correct position (position 4)
  Y(✓) -> correct position (position 5)

So, the feedback tells us:
- H is absent.
- A, N, D, Y are correct and in the positions we guessed.

Therefore, the secret word must be: 
  Position 1: ? (unknown)
  Position 2: A (correct)
  Position 3: N (correct)
  Position 4: D (correct)
  Position 5: Y (correct)

So the word pattern is: _ A N D Y

We only need to find the first letter.

Constraints:
- The first letter cannot be any of the absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, H (from HANDY feedback).
- It must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated and must form a valid English word.

We need to find words that fit the pattern _ A N D Y.

Common possibilities:
- BANDY
- CANDY -> but C is absent? From first guess: C is absent. So invalid.
- DANDY -> but D is already in position 4? And we are using Y in 5. But ""DANDY"" would be D in position 1, but we have D in position 4. Would that be allowed? Actually, we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, in our feedback, we have D marked as correct in position 4. If we put D in position 1 as well, that might be possible, but we need to check.
  But note: in ""DANDY"", we have:
    Position 1: D
    Position 2: A
    Position 3: N
    Position 4: D
    Position 5: Y

  But we already know from the pattern that position 4 is D. So if the word has another D in position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we haven't tested for duplicates before? The feedback doesn't show duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess one in the correct position and one in a wrong position, it might show accordingly. But in HANDY, we had D in position 4 and it was correct. So if we try ""DANDY"", we are putting D in position 1 and position 4. If the word has D only once (at position 4), then position 1 would get an 'x' for D? Actually, no: because we are using D in two positions. The feedback might mark the one in position 4 as correct and the one in position 1 as absent (if there's only one D). But in our case, we know D is in position 4, so if there is no other D, then the D in position 1 would be marked absent.

  We haven't eliminated D for position 1? But we know D is in the word at position 4. So if the first letter is D, then the word has two D's. But we don't know if that's the case.

  We need to test.

  Alternatively, we can try another letter.

But first, let's list possible words ending in ""ANDY"" that are 5 letters.

Possible words:
- BANDY: B A N D Y
- CANDY: C A N D Y -> but C is absent? Yes, from first guess.
- DANDY: D A N D Y -> has two D's? But possible.
- FANDY: not a word? 
- GANDY: rare? 
- HANDY: we already tried, but H is absent, and we know the word isn't HANDY because H is absent and we didn't have it correct.
- MANDY: M A N D Y -> a valid word (e.g., a name or colloquial term).
- PANDY: P A N D Y -> valid in certain dialects (to strike on the palm) or as a name.
- RANDY: R A N D Y -> but R is absent? From first guess: R is absent. So invalid.
- SANDY: S A N D Y -> but S is absent? From SATIN: S is absent. So invalid.
- WANDY: not common? 
- VANDY: as in Vandy? abbreviation for Vanderbilt? Not universally recognized.

Common choices: BANDY, MANDY, PANDY, and DANDY.

But note:
- DANDY: has two D's. We know D is at position 4. If we try D in position 1, and if the word has only one D (at position 4), then position 1 would be marked absent. But if it has two D's, then position 1 might be marked correct or wrong position? We don't know.

We have limited guesses (we are at guess 4 of 6), so we can guess one of these.

Since we have multiple options, we should choose one that tests a new letter.

We haven't tested B, M, P, etc.

We don't know which one is correct.

But note: we know the first letter cannot be H, and cannot be any of the absent letters.

We can choose a word that has a single new letter for position 1, but we must form a valid word.

Alternatively, we can just guess one of the candidates.

But we have three possibilities: B, M, P for the first letter (and D, but that has duplication).

We should try the most common one or one that gives us information.

But since we are only missing the first letter, we can guess one.

Let me see the frequency: 
- ""BANDY"" means to pass from one to another, or have legs that curve outwards. 
- ""MANDY"" is a name.
- ""PANDY"" is a Scottish term for striking on the hand, or a name.
- ""DANDY"" is a well-known word.

""DANDY"" might be the most common.

But we need to check if D is allowed in position 1? We know D is in the word at position 4, so using D in position 1 might be acceptable if duplicated.

However, to be safe, we can choose a word that introduces a new letter.

I'll go with ""BANDY"" because it uses B, which hasn't been tested, and if it's not correct, we can eliminate B.

Similarly, if we try ""MANDY"", we test M.

But we have only one letter to guess, so we can pick one.

The system expects one guess.

Given that ""DANDY"" is a valid word and quite common, and we know the pattern is _ANDY, let's choose ""DANDY"". But note that if there is only one D, then the first letter D would be marked absent, and we would know it's not D.

But we can learn from that.

Alternatively, to avoid duplication, we can pick a word that doesn't use D in position 1.

Let me list: BANDY, MANDY, PANDY.

I think ""BANDY"" is a good choice because B is a common letter.

But we are only testing the first letter.

So I'll go ahead and choose ""BANDY"".

If it's not, then we try others.

But we have other options: LANDY? but L hasn't been tested? ""LANDY"" is not a standard word. Similarly, ""WANDY"" is not common.

So the realistic options are B, M, P, D.

We can pick ""BANDY"" as it tests B.

Therefore, I choose ""BANDY"".The secret word pattern is _ANDY, with A,N,D,Y confirmed in positions 2,3,4,5 respectively.  
From feedback:  
- All absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, H  
- Present letters: A, N, D, Y (fixed in positions 2-5).  

Thus:  
- Only position 1 is unknown.  
- Possible letters: Any unused consonants/vowels except absent letters.  
- Likely candidates: **B, M, P, D, G, etc.** but must form a valid word.  

Top valid options:  
1. **BANDY** (B in position 1)  
2. **DANDY** (D in position 1; possible duplicate D)  
3. **MANDY** (M in position 1)  
4. **PANDY** (P in position 1)  

Strategy:  
- Choose **BANDY** to test a new common letter (B) and avoid duplication risk.  
- If incorrect, proceed to test M or P next.  

<guess>BANDY</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - Guess 1 (CRANE): A and N are in the word but not in positions 3/4; C, R, E absent.
   - Guess 2 (SATIN): A is confirmed in position 2; N is present but not in position 5; S/T/I absent.
   - Guess 3 (HANDY): N in position 3, D in position 4, and Y in position 5 are correct; A (position 2) reconfirmed; H absent.

2. **Current Known Information**:
   - **Secret word pattern**: `_ A N D Y` (positions 2, 3, 4, 5 confirmed as A, N, D, Y respectively).
   - **Confirmed present letters**: A, N, D, Y (fixed positions).
   - **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I, H (excluded).
   - Position 1 must be a new letter (not absent) to form a valid English word.

3. **Deduction**:
   - Only position 1 is unknown.
   - Possible words: `?ANDY` (e.g., BANDY, DANDY, MANDY, PANDY, WANDY, etc.).
   - Common valid options: 
     - **BANDY** (B in position 1).
     - **DANDY** (D in position 1; risk of duplicate D but possible).
     - **MANDY** (M in position 1).
     - **PANDY** (P in position 1).
   - Test **BANDY**:
     - Uses B, a high-frequency unused consonant.
     - Avoids ambiguity (unlike DANDY, which may have duplicate D).
     - If incorrect, eliminates B and narrows to M/P/D in subsequent guesses.

Actually: \n      P L A N T -> A is in position 3, but in the first guess ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and we know it\'s not in that position. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.

Actually, we can only avoid C, R, E. But ""MANGO"" has O and G. However, we must avoid E? It doesn\'t have E. But wait, we are avoiding C, R, E. So ""MANGO"" is okay? But let\'s check positions:\n  M A N G O -> A is in position 2 (okay, not 3), N is in position 3 (okay, not 4). \nBut we also have to consider that the word must be valid. However, note that the feedback for the first guess said A and N are present, so we must include them.\n\nBut wait: ""MANGO"" has the letter O and G, which we haven\'t tested. However, we are allowed to use any letters except C, R, E.\n\nBut is ""MANGO"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut we can do better: we want to test more common letters. Also, we have two new letters: M and G and O. That\'s three new letters.

Yes, but it has C? C is not allowed (we know C is absent). So invalid.\n\n""LANTS"" -> not a common word? Actually, we need a valid English word. ""LANT"" is not common, but ""SLANT"" is.\n\n""SLANT"": \n  S L A N T -> \n    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because in CRANE, A was in 3 and it was wrong position, so it cannot be in 3 again). \n  So invalid.\n\n""TAKEN"" -> but E is not allowed? We know E is absent, so we cannot use E. So invalid.\n\n""TANGO"": \n  T A N G O -> \n    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 3 (okay). \n  This uses T, G, O.\n\nBut note: we are putting N in position 3, which is new (previously it was in 4). So that\'s acceptable.\n\nHowever, we have two candidates: ""NASTY"" and ""TANGO"". \n\nWe want to maximize information. In ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1 and A at position 2, and also S, T, Y. In ""TANGO"", we are testing T, A, N, G, O.\n\nWe also note that we have two letters we know are in the word (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions and also discover other letters.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t eliminated, such as S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.\n\nBut we must avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.\n\nLet me try to list words that have A and N, without C, R, E, and with A not in 3 and N not in 4.\n\n- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> A in 2 (okay), but no N? We must include N. So invalid.\n\n- ""PAINS"": P A I N S -> A in 2 (okay), N in 4 -> not allowed.\n\n- ""MAINS"": same issue, N in 4.\n\n- ""SAUNA"": S A U N A -> A in 2 and 5, N in 4 -> N in 4 is not allowed.\n\n- ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses B, J, O.\n\nBut J is not very common. We might get less information.\n\n- ""WAGON"": W A G O N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses W, G, O.\n\n- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses H, D, Y.\n\n- ""PANSY"": P A N S Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses P, S, Y.\n\n""PANSY"" seems good: \n  Positions: \n    P (1), A (2), N (3), S (4), Y (5)\n  A is in 2 (new, not 3) -> okay\n  N is in 3 (new, not 4) -> okay\n  We are testing P, S, Y which are common.\n\nBut note: we are putting N in position 3. Is that acceptable? Yes, because the feedback only said that N is not in position 4, but it could be in 3.\n\nSimilarly, A is in 2, which is acceptable.\n\nAnother candidate: ""NADIR"": but R is not allowed? We know R is absent. So invalid.\n\n""LATIN"": L A T I N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses L, T, I.\n\nBut we don\'t have the letter S? We might want to test S because it\'s very common.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nI think ""PANSY"" is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (P, S, Y) and places A and N in new positions.\n\nAlternatively, ""NASTY"" is also good: \n  N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. \n  This tests N at the start (which we haven\'t tried) and A in 2, and also S, T, Y.\n\nBut note: in ""NASTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and N in position 1. We know that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4. So positions 1 and 2 for N and A are both new.\n\nHowever, we are using two positions that we haven\'t tested for A and N. \n\nBut we have to be cautious: if we put both A and N in new positions, we might get more information about their correct positions.\n\nBut also, we are testing three new letters: S, T, Y.\n\nSimilarly, ""PANSY"" tests P, S, Y and puts A in 2 and N in 3.\n\nI think both are reasonable. But let me see which one covers more common letters.\n\nThe frequency of letters in English words (for 5-letter words) might help. Common letters: S, T, L, N (but we already know N), A (we know A), then P, O, I, etc.\n\nS and T are very common. So both ""NASTY"" and ""PANSY"" have S and T? Actually, ""PANSY"" has S and Y, but not T. ""NASTY"" has S, T, and Y.\n\nSo ""NASTY"" tests T as well, which is more common than P.\n\nTherefore, I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.\n\nBut wait: in ""NASTY"", we are putting N in position 1. We don\'t know if that is correct. Similarly, A in position 2. But that\'s the point: we are testing these positions.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t put A and N in adjacent positions to get more positional information.\n\nBut I think ""NASTY"" is a solid choice.\n\nAnother candidate: ""STAIN"" -> \n  S T A I N -> \n    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.\n\n""SATIN"": \n  S A T I N -> \n    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). \n  This uses S, T, I.\n\nBut note: we are putting A in 2 and N in 5. This is acceptable.\n\nAnd we are testing S, T, I.\n\nBut we are not testing Y? That\'s okay. We can test Y later.\n\n""SATIN"" is also a good candidate because it uses very common letters.\n\nBut we already know that A and N are in the word, so we are focusing on finding their positions and discovering other letters.\n\nBetween ""NASTY"" and ""SATIN"", which one?\n\n""NASTY"": tests N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.\n""SATIN"": tests S in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, N in 5.\n\nWe know that A is not in 3, so in ""SATIN"", T is in 3 and that\'s a new letter in that position. Also, we are testing I.\n\nBut note: we have no information about I, so it\'s good to test.\n\nHowever, in ""NASTY"", we are testing Y which is less common than I? Actually, I is more common.\n\nBut we are also testing T in both. \n\nI think ""SATIN"" might be better because it uses I (a common vowel) and avoids putting two known letters (A and N) in the first two positions, which might be less likely? Not necessarily.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have two known letters (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions. In ""SATIN"", we are putting A in 2 and N in 5, which are two different positions. In ""NASTY"", we are putting both at the front.\n\nWe might get more information if we spread them out.\n\nBut I don\'t have a strong preference.\n\nAnother candidate: ""POINT"" -> but we must include A and N? We cannot leave out A or N because we know they are in the word. So we must include both.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word that contains both A and N.\n\nAfter considering, I think ""SATIN"" is a good choice because:\n- It uses common letters: S, A, T, I, N.\n- It places A in position 2 (which is new) and N in position 5 (which is new, since previously N was in 4).\n- It tests the vowel I, which is common.\n\nAlternatively, ""TAINT"" -> but T is repeated?

Yes, but let\'s check: N A V A L -> but A is repeated? We have A in position 2 and 4? But we don\'t know if A is repeated. The feedback for CRANE had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t mean there isn\'t another A. However, in SATIN, we had A in position 2 and it was correct, and no other A. But we don\'t know. To be safe, we should avoid assuming no duplicates for A? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates, so we can try.\n\nBut let\'s see: in ""NAVAL"", we have A in position 2 (correct) and also in position 4. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, we are trying to guess, so it\'s acceptable. But we are also testing V and L.\n\nBut note: we are putting N in position 1, which is a possibility.\n\nAnother word: ""NADIR"" -> but R is absent (we know R is not in the word).

In the pattern for N in position 3, we have three blanks (positions 1,4,5). So in both cases, we have three new letters to find.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has N in position 1 or 3 and includes three new common letters.\n\nBut we must decide the position for N.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t fix N to one position but tests both possibilities? That might be hard.\n\nWe know N must be in position 1 or 3. So we can choose a word that has N in one of these positions and then see the feedback.\n\nI think it\'s better to pick one case and test it.\n\nBut which one? We don\'t have information to prefer one over the other.\n\nWe can choose a word that tests N in position 1 and also tests common letters, and if it\'s wrong, then N must be in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, we can do the opposite.\n\nBut we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has N in position 3 and also tests letters that are common, and then we can get information about the other positions.\n\nLet me try to choose ""HANDY"": \n  H A N D Y\n  This assumes N is in position 3 (so pattern _ A N _ _) and tests H, D, Y.\n\nBut if N is actually in position 1, then this word would not have N in position 3 and we would get feedback that N is not in the word? But we know N is in the word, so if we put N in position 3 and it\'s not there, then the feedback for N would be \'-\' (wrong position) or \'x\' if it\'s not in the word at all? But we know it is in the word, so if we put it in position 3 and it\'s not there, it would be \'-\'. But we already know it\'s not in position 4 or 5, so if it\'s not in 3, then it must be in 1.\n\nSo by putting N in position 3, we can confirm if it is there or not.\n\nSimilarly, if we put N in position 1, we can see if it is there.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word that puts N in one of the positions, say position 3, and tests new letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""HANDY"": \n  H A N D Y\n  - Position 1: H (new)\n  - Position 2: A (correct, we know)\n  - Position 3: N (we are testing if it is here)\n  - Position 4: D (new)\n  - Position 5: Y (new)\n\nIf N is in position 3, then we get a check for N. If not, then we get a \'-\' for N and we know it must be in position 1.\n\nAdditionally, we test H, D, Y.\n\nBut note: we are using a pattern that requires position 3 to be N. If it\'s not, then we know N is in 1.\n\nBut we are also testing three new letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.\n\nBut ""HANDY"" seems fine.\n\nWe could also test more common letters. For example, ""PANSY"" but S is absent, so invalid.\n\n""BALDY"" -> B A L D Y -> but this doesn\'t have N? We must include N. So invalid.\n\nWe must include N.\n\nSo ""HANDY"" is a valid choice.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that tests more common letters.\n\nCommon letters: L, O, U, D, M, P, etc.\n\nWhat about ""ALONG""? But we don\'t have N in position 1 or 3? ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> but A is in position 1? But we need A in position 2. So invalid.\n\n""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but I is absent, and also N is in position 5? But we know N is not in position 5 (from SATIN feedback: N in position 5 was wrong). So we cannot put N in 5. Also, I is absent.\n\n""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> but T is absent, and N is in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4 (from CRANE: N in 4 was wrong). So invalid.\n\n""LAUND"" -> not a word.\n\nSo ""HANDY"" seems reasonable.\n\nAnother option: ""BANAL"" -> B A N A L -> but A repeated? And we are testing B and L. But if there is no second A, then it might not be good. But we don\'t know.\n\n""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> A repeated.\n\nI think ""HANDY"" is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HANDY"".Based on the feedback:\n- A is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from SATIN).\n- N is present but not in position 5 (from SATIN) and not in position 4 (from CRANE), so it must be in position 1 or 3.\n- Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I.\n\nStrategy for the next guess:\n- Must include A in position 2 and N in either position 1 or 3.\n- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., D, H, L, M, O, P, Y) while avoiding absent letters.\n\nChosen word: ""HANDY""\n- Structure: H (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), N (position 3, testing if N is here), D (position 4), Y (position 5).\n- Tests N in position 3 (if correct, we get confirmation; if not, N must be in position 1).\n- Tests three new letters: H, D, Y (all common and untested).\n\n<thinking>\nFeedback from previous guesses:\n1.

From first guess: C is absent. So invalid.\n- DANDY -> but D is already in position 4? And we are using Y in 5. But ""DANDY"" would be D in position 1, but we have D in position 4. Would that be allowed? Actually, we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. However, in our feedback, we have D marked as correct in position 4. If we put D in position 1 as well, that might be possible, but we need to check.\n  But note: in ""DANDY"", we have:\n    Position 1: D\n    Position 2: A\n    Position 3: N\n    Position 4: D\n    Position 5: Y\n\n  But we already know from the pattern that position 4 is D. So if the word has another D in position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we haven\'t tested for duplicates before? The feedback doesn\'t show duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess one in the correct position and one in a wrong position, it might show accordingly. But in HANDY, we had D in position 4 and it was correct. So if we try ""DANDY"", we are putting D in position 1 and position 4. If the word has D only once (at position 4), then position 1 would get an \'x\' for D? Actually, no: because we are using D in two positions. The feedback might mark the one in position 4 as correct and the one in position 1 as absent (if there\'s only one D). But in our case, we know D is in position 4, so if there is no other D, then the D in position 1 would be marked absent.\n\n  We haven\'t eliminated D for position 1? But we know D is in the word at position 4. So if the first letter is D, then the word has two D\'s. But we don\'t know if that\'s the case.\n\n  We need to test.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try another letter.\n\nBut first, let\'s list possible words ending in ""ANDY"" that are 5 letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- BANDY: B A N D Y\n- CANDY: C A N D Y -> but C is absent? Yes, from first guess.\n- DANDY: D A N D Y -> has two D\'s? But possible.\n- FANDY: not a word? \n- GANDY: rare? \n- HANDY: we already tried, but H is absent, and we know the word isn\'t HANDY because H is absent and we didn\'t have it correct.\n- MANDY: M A N D Y -> a valid word (e.g., a name or colloquial term).\n- PANDY: P A N D Y -> valid in certain dialects (to strike on the palm) or as a name.\n- RANDY: R A N D Y -> but R is absent? From first guess: R is absent. So invalid.\n- SANDY: S A N D Y -> but S is absent? From SATIN: S is absent. So invalid.\n- WANDY: not common? \n- VANDY: as in Vandy? abbreviation for Vanderbilt? Not universally recognized.\n\nCommon choices: BANDY, MANDY, PANDY, and DANDY.\n\nBut note:\n- DANDY: has two D\'s. We know D is at position 4. If we try D in position 1, and if the word has only one D (at position 4), then position 1 would be marked absent. But if it has two D\'s, then position 1 might be marked correct or wrong position? We don\'t know.\n\nWe have limited guesses (we are at guess 4 of 6), so we can guess one of these.\n\nSince we have multiple options, we should choose one that tests a new letter.\n\nWe haven\'t tested B, M, P, etc.\n\nWe don\'t know which one is correct.\n\nBut note: we know the first letter cannot be H, and cannot be any of the absent letters.\n\nWe can choose a word that has a single new letter for position 1, but we must form a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, we can just guess one of the candidates.\n\nBut we have three possibilities: B, M, P for the first letter (and D, but that has duplication).\n\nWe should try the most common one or one that gives us information.\n\nBut since we are only missing the first letter, we can guess one.\n\nLet me see the frequency: \n- ""BANDY"" means to pass from one to another, or have legs that curve outwards. \n- ""MANDY"" is a name.\n- ""PANDY"" is a Scottish term for striking on the hand, or a name.\n- ""DANDY"" is a well-known word.\n\n""DANDY"" might be the most common.\n\nBut we need to check if D is allowed in position 1? We know D is in the word at position 4, so using D in position 1 might be acceptable if duplicated.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we can choose a word that introduces a new letter.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BANDY"" because it uses B, which hasn\'t been tested, and if it\'s not correct, we can eliminate B.\n\nSimilarly, if we try ""MANDY"", we test M.\n\nBut we have only one letter to guess, so we can pick one.\n\nThe system expects one guess.\n\nGiven that ""DANDY"" is a valid word and quite common, and we know the pattern is _ANDY, let\'s choose ""DANDY"". But note that if there is only one D, then the first letter D would be marked absent, and we would know it\'s not D.\n\nBut we can learn from that.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid duplication, we can pick a word that doesn\'t use D in position 1.\n\nLet me list: BANDY, MANDY, PANDY.\n\nI think ""BANDY"" is a good choice because B is a common letter.\n\nBut we are only testing the first letter.\n\nSo I\'ll go ahead and choose ""BANDY"".\n\nIf it\'s not, then we try others.\n\nBut we have other options: LANDY? but L hasn\'t been tested? ""LANDY"" is not a standard word. Similarly, ""WANDY"" is not common.\n\nSo the realistic options are B, M, P, D.\n\nWe can pick ""BANDY"" as it tests B.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""BANDY"".The secret word pattern is _ANDY, with A,N,D,Y confirmed in positions 2,3,4,5 respectively.  \nFrom feedback:  \n- All absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, H  \n- Present letters: A, N, D, Y (fixed in positions 2-5).  \n\nThus:  \n- Only position 1 is unknown.  \n- Possible letters: Any unused consonants/vowels except absent letters.  \n- Likely candidates: **B, M, P, D, G, etc.** but must form a valid word.  \n\nTop valid options:  \n1. **BANDY** (B in position 1)  \n2. **DANDY** (D in position 1; possible duplicate D)  \n3. **MANDY** (M in position 1)  \n4. **PANDY** (P in position 1)  \n\nStrategy:  \n- Choose **BANDY** to test a new common letter (B) and avoid duplication risk.  \n- If incorrect, proceed to test M or P next.  \n\n<guess>BANDY</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Feedback from Previous Guesses**:\n   - Guess 1 (CRANE): A and N are in the word but not in positions 3/4; C, R, E absent.\n   - Guess 2 (SATIN): A is confirmed in position 2; N is present but not in position 5; S/T/I absent.\n   - Guess 3 (HANDY): N in position 3, D in position 4, and Y in position 5 are correct; A (position 2) reconfirmed; H absent.\n\n2. **Current Known Information**:\n   - **Secret word pattern**: `_ A N D Y` (positions 2, 3, 4, 5 confirmed as A, N, D, Y respectively).\n   - **Confirmed present letters**: A, N, D, Y (fixed positions).\n   - **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I, H (excluded).\n   - Position 1 must be a new letter (not absent) to form a valid English word.\n\n3. **Deduction**:\n   - Only position 1 is unknown.\n   - Possible words: `?ANDY` (e.g., BANDY, DANDY, MANDY, PANDY, WANDY, etc.).\n   - Common valid options: \n     - **BANDY** (B in position 1).\n     - **DANDY** (D in position 1; risk of duplicate D but possible).\n     - **MANDY** (M in position 1).\n     - **PANDY** (P in position 1).\n   - Test **BANDY**:\n     - Uses B, a high-frequency unused consonant.\n     - Avoids ambiguity (unlike DANDY, which may have duplicate D).\n     - If incorrect, eliminates B and narrows to M/P/D in subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>BANDY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SATIN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) T(x) I(x) N(-)\nGuess 3: HANDY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: BANDY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback for the fourth guess ""BANDY"":
  B(x) -> B is absent
  A(✓) -> correct (position 2)
  N(✓) -> correct (position 3)
  D(✓) -> correct (position 4)
  Y(✓) -> correct (position 5)

This tells us:
- B is not the first letter and not in the word at all.
- The secret word remains in the pattern: _ A N D Y

Now, we know that the first letter cannot be B and cannot be any of the previously absent letters (C, R, E, S, T, I, H, and now B).

We need to find a word that fits _ A N D Y, using a letter that hasn't been eliminated.

Previously, we considered options like DANDY, MANDY, PANDY, etc.

Now we know B is absent, so ""BANDY"" is eliminated.

Next common possibilities:
- ""DANDY"": D in position 1. But note: we have D already in position 4. If the word has only one D, then the D in position 1 would be incorrect. But if it has two D's, it might be valid.
- ""MANDY"": M in position 1.
- ""PANDY"": P in position 1.
- ""WANDY"": less common, but possible? ""Wandy"" is not standard; ""WANDY"" might be a name or rare.
- ""GANDY"": could be a surname or place name.
- ""VANDY"": abbreviation for Vanderbilt, but informal.

Common English words: DANDY, MANDY, PANDY.

Since B is now absent, we can try ""MANDY"" next.

But note: we have only 2 guesses left (this is guess 5, and we started with 6).

We might as well try ""MANDY"". If it's wrong, then we try ""PANDY"" or ""DANDY"".

Alternatively, we could try ""DANDY"" because it's a common word.

But let's check: if ""DANDY"" is the secret word, then it has two D's: one in position 1 and one in position 4. We haven't considered duplicate letters before. The feedback for HANDY showed D as present only in position 4, but that doesn't indicate duplicates. Similarly, in BANDY, only position 4 D was correct.

In HANDY, we had D only in position 4 and it was correct. In BANDY, same. There's no indication that D appears elsewhere.

But we don't know for sure.

We might test ""MANDY"" to avoid duplication unless necessary.

I think ""DANDY"" is a valid word and we should consider it.

But to be systematic, let's try ""MANDY"" next.

So I'll choose ""MANDY"".Based on the feedback:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ANDY` (positions 2-5: A, N, D, Y confirmed).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I, H, **B** (new from BANDY).

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Position 1 candidates** must be a letter not in the absent list and form a valid word.
   - Likely options: 
     - **DANDY** (D in position 1; risk of duplicate D but possible).
     - **MANDY** (M in position 1).
     - **PANDY** (P in position 1).
2. **Strategy**:
   - Test **MANDY** next: 
     - Uses a new common letter (M).
     - If correct: solved. If not, eliminates M and leaves D/P as options.
```json
{""thoughts"": ""Position 1 must be M, D, or P. Testing MANDY maximizes new information by covering a previously untested high-frequency consonant (M).""}
```

<guess>MANDY</guess>
</think>
The feedback confirms:
- The secret word is `_ A N D Y` (positions 2–5 are fixed as A, N, D, Y).
- New absent letter: **B** (from position 1 of ""BANDY"").
- Updated absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, H, B.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Eliminated letters** (absent):  
   C, R, E, S, T, I, H, B.  
2. **Remaining task**:  
   Deduce position 1 (unknown) from unused letters to form a valid ""?ANDY"" word.  
3. **Top candidates**:  
   - `DANDY` (D in position 1; possible duplicate D)  
   - `MANDY` (M in position 1)  
   - `PANDY` (P in position 1)  
4. **Strategy**:  
   Prioritize `MANDY` to test a new common consonant (**M**) and avoid duplication ambiguity (unlike `DANDY`).  
   If incorrect, `DANDY` or `PANDY` can be tried next.

<guess>MANDY</guess>",MANDY,"We have feedback for the fourth guess ""BANDY"":
  B(x) -> B is absent
  A(✓) -> correct (position 2)
  N(✓) -> correct (position 3)
  D(✓) -> correct (position 4)
  Y(✓) -> correct (position 5)

This tells us:
- B is not the first letter and not in the word at all.
- The secret word remains in the pattern: _ A N D Y

Now, we know that the first letter cannot be B and cannot be any of the previously absent letters (C, R, E, S, T, I, H, and now B).

We need to find a word that fits _ A N D Y, using a letter that hasn't been eliminated.

Previously, we considered options like DANDY, MANDY, PANDY, etc.

Now we know B is absent, so ""BANDY"" is eliminated.

Next common possibilities:
- ""DANDY"": D in position 1. But note: we have D already in position 4. If the word has only one D, then the D in position 1 would be incorrect. But if it has two D's, it might be valid.

deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,6,DANDY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting a new game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a strong starting word.
 A good starting word often has:
   - 5 different letters to maximize information.
   - Common letters to increase the chance of hitting some in the secret word.
 Examples of such words: ""CRANE"", ""SALET"", ""ROATE"", etc.

 I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, my first guess is CRANE.<thinking>
I'm starting a new game with no prior guesses or feedback. For an optimal first guess in Wordle, I should use a word that:
- Contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information
- Avoids repeated letters
- Has letters that frequently appear in English words

""CRANE"" is an excellent starting word because:
- It contains three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N)
- Uses five distinct letters
- Covers frequently used letters like R, A, and E
- Has been statistically proven effective in Wordle strategies

This first guess will help establish which letters are present/absent and potentially reveal correct positions, setting up stronger subsequent guesses.
</thinking>

<guess>CRANE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""CRANE"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were in (position 3 and 4 respectively in ""CRANE"").
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We must choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Includes A and N (since they are present in the word)
- Does not include C, R, or E (since they are absent)
- Places A and N in positions different from the first guess (i.e., A cannot be in the 3rd position, N cannot be in the 4th position)

Additionally, we want to maximize information by:
- Using other common letters that haven't been tested yet (like T, O, I, S, L, etc.)
- Avoiding letters we already know are absent (C, R, E)

Let's think of words that contain A and N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible letters to use: We have 3 more letters to choose (since A and N are fixed). We should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common consonants: T, S, L, D, M, P, etc.
Common vowels: O, I, U (but we already have A, so maybe one more vowel?).

We also note that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4.

Let's try to form a word that has A and N, and also includes T, O, S, or other common letters.

Some candidate words:
- ""PLANT"": 
  - Contains A and N (and also P, L, T)
  - But note: in ""PLANT"", A is in position 3? Actually: 
      P L A N T -> A is in position 3, but in the first guess ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and we know it's not in that position. So we cannot put A in position 3 again. Therefore, ""PLANT"" is invalid because A is in position 3.

- ""PAINT"": 
  - P A I N T -> A is in position 2, N is in position 4. 
  - But in the first guess, N was in position 4 and we know it's not in position 4. So we cannot put N in position 4. Therefore, ""PAINT"" is invalid.

- ""SAINT"": 
  - S A I N T -> A in position 2, N in position 4 -> again, N in position 4 is not allowed.

We need to avoid putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

Let's try to put A in a new position and N in a new position.

Possible positions for A: 1, 2, 4, 5 (since not 3)
Possible positions for N: 1, 2, 3, 5 (since not 4)

Another candidate: ""MANGO"" -> but we cannot use E? Actually, we can only avoid C, R, E. But ""MANGO"" has O and G. However, we must avoid E? It doesn't have E. But wait, we are avoiding C, R, E. So ""MANGO"" is okay? But let's check positions:
  M A N G O -> A is in position 2 (okay, not 3), N is in position 3 (okay, not 4). 
But we also have to consider that the word must be valid. However, note that the feedback for the first guess said A and N are present, so we must include them.

But wait: ""MANGO"" has the letter O and G, which we haven't tested. However, we are allowed to use any letters except C, R, E.

But is ""MANGO"" a valid word? Yes.

But we can do better: we want to test more common letters. Also, we have two new letters: M and G and O. That's three new letters. But we might want to test more frequent letters.

Another candidate: ""STAND""
  S T A N D -> 
    A is in position 3? -> but we cannot put A in position 3. So invalid.

""TALON"": 
  T A L O N -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  Letters: T, A, L, O, N -> includes A and N, and new letters T, L, O. 
  Avoids C, R, E.

But note: we have two positions for A and N that are acceptable.

Another candidate: ""ALONG""
  A L O N G -> 
    A in position 1 (okay), N in position 4 -> but we cannot put N in position 4 (because in CRANE it was in 4 and was wrong). So invalid.

""ADMIN"": 
  A D M I N -> 
    A in position 1 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  Letters: A, D, M, I, N -> new letters D, M, I.

But we might prefer more common letters.

""DAUNT"": 
  D A U N T -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 4 -> not allowed (position 4 for N is invalid).

""NASTY"": 
  N A S T Y -> 
    N in position 1 (okay), A in position 2 (okay). 
  But note: we have to be cautious because we are putting N at the start and A at position 2. 
  This word uses S, T, Y as new letters.

This seems acceptable.

But let's check: 
  In ""NASTY"": 
    N is in position 1 (which is new, since previously N was in 4 and now we are trying 1)
    A is in position 2 (previously was in 3, now 2 is new)

So ""NASTY"" is a candidate.

Another candidate: ""PAINT"" we already saw is invalid because of N in 4.

""OCTAN"" -> but O is allowed? Yes, but it has C? C is not allowed (we know C is absent). So invalid.

""LANTS"" -> not a common word? Actually, we need a valid English word. ""LANT"" is not common, but ""SLANT"" is.

""SLANT"": 
  S L A N T -> 
    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because in CRANE, A was in 3 and it was wrong position, so it cannot be in 3 again). 
  So invalid.

""TAKEN"" -> but E is not allowed? We know E is absent, so we cannot use E. So invalid.

""TANGO"": 
  T A N G O -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 3 (okay). 
  This uses T, G, O.

But note: we are putting N in position 3, which is new (previously it was in 4). So that's acceptable.

However, we have two candidates: ""NASTY"" and ""TANGO"". 

We want to maximize information. In ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1 and A at position 2, and also S, T, Y. In ""TANGO"", we are testing T, A, N, G, O.

We also note that we have two letters we know are in the word (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions and also discover other letters.

Another idea: we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters that we haven't eliminated, such as S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.

But we must avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.

Let me try to list words that have A and N, without C, R, E, and with A not in 3 and N not in 4.

- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> A in 2 (okay), but no N? We must include N. So invalid.

- ""PAINS"": P A I N S -> A in 2 (okay), N in 4 -> not allowed.

- ""MAINS"": same issue, N in 4.

- ""SAUNA"": S A U N A -> A in 2 and 5, N in 4 -> N in 4 is not allowed.

- ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses B, J, O.

But J is not very common. We might get less information.

- ""WAGON"": W A G O N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses W, G, O.

- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses H, D, Y.

- ""PANSY"": P A N S Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses P, S, Y.

""PANSY"" seems good: 
  Positions: 
    P (1), A (2), N (3), S (4), Y (5)
  A is in 2 (new, not 3) -> okay
  N is in 3 (new, not 4) -> okay
  We are testing P, S, Y which are common.

But note: we are putting N in position 3. Is that acceptable? Yes, because the feedback only said that N is not in position 4, but it could be in 3.

Similarly, A is in 2, which is acceptable.

Another candidate: ""NADIR"": but R is not allowed? We know R is absent. So invalid.

""LATIN"": L A T I N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses L, T, I.

But we don't have the letter S? We might want to test S because it's very common.

We have to choose one.

I think ""PANSY"" is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (P, S, Y) and places A and N in new positions.

Alternatively, ""NASTY"" is also good: 
  N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. 
  This tests N at the start (which we haven't tried) and A in 2, and also S, T, Y.

But note: in ""NASTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and N in position 1. We know that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4. So positions 1 and 2 for N and A are both new.

However, we are using two positions that we haven't tested for A and N. 

But we have to be cautious: if we put both A and N in new positions, we might get more information about their correct positions.

But also, we are testing three new letters: S, T, Y.

Similarly, ""PANSY"" tests P, S, Y and puts A in 2 and N in 3.

I think both are reasonable. But let me see which one covers more common letters.

The frequency of letters in English words (for 5-letter words) might help. Common letters: S, T, L, N (but we already know N), A (we know A), then P, O, I, etc.

S and T are very common. So both ""NASTY"" and ""PANSY"" have S and T? Actually, ""PANSY"" has S and Y, but not T. ""NASTY"" has S, T, and Y.

So ""NASTY"" tests T as well, which is more common than P.

Therefore, I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.

But wait: in ""NASTY"", we are putting N in position 1. We don't know if that is correct. Similarly, A in position 2. But that's the point: we are testing these positions.

Alternatively, we could choose a word that doesn't put A and N in adjacent positions to get more positional information.

But I think ""NASTY"" is a solid choice.

Another candidate: ""STAIN"" -> 
  S T A I N -> 
    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.

""SATIN"": 
  S A T I N -> 
    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). 
  This uses S, T, I.

But note: we are putting A in 2 and N in 5. This is acceptable.

And we are testing S, T, I.

But we are not testing Y? That's okay. We can test Y later.

""SATIN"" is also a good candidate because it uses very common letters.

But we already know that A and N are in the word, so we are focusing on finding their positions and discovering other letters.

Between ""NASTY"" and ""SATIN"", which one?

""NASTY"": tests N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.
""SATIN"": tests S in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, N in 5.

We know that A is not in 3, so in ""SATIN"", T is in 3 and that's a new letter in that position. Also, we are testing I.

But note: we have no information about I, so it's good to test.

However, in ""NASTY"", we are testing Y which is less common than I? Actually, I is more common.

But we are also testing T in both. 

I think ""SATIN"" might be better because it uses I (a common vowel) and avoids putting two known letters (A and N) in the first two positions, which might be less likely? Not necessarily.

But let's consider: we have two known letters (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions. In ""SATIN"", we are putting A in 2 and N in 5, which are two different positions. In ""NASTY"", we are putting both at the front.

We might get more information if we spread them out.

But I don't have a strong preference.

Another candidate: ""POINT"" -> but we must include A and N? We cannot leave out A or N because we know they are in the word. So we must include both.

Therefore, we must choose a word that contains both A and N.

After considering, I think ""SATIN"" is a good choice because:
- It uses common letters: S, A, T, I, N.
- It places A in position 2 (which is new) and N in position 5 (which is new, since previously N was in 4).
- It tests the vowel I, which is common.

Alternatively, ""TAINT"" -> but T is repeated? We want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information. ""TAINT"" has two T's. So not ideal.

""SAINT"" is invalid because N is in 4.

So I'll go with ""SATIN"".

But let me confirm: 
  S A T I N
  A is in position 2 (which is not 3, so okay)
  N is in position 5 (which is not 4, so okay)

And the word is valid.

We are testing S, T, I, and we already know A and N are present.

So we can get information about S, T, I and the positions of A and N.

Therefore, I choose ""SATIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- C, R, and E are absent from the secret word.
- A and N are present but not in positions 3 or 4 (as indicated by the ""-"" symbols).

For the next guess:
- Must include A and N (since they are in the secret word).
- Must exclude C, R, and E (since they are absent).
- A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4 (to avoid repeating invalid positions).
- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O) to maximize information.

After evaluating options:
- ""SATIN"" is chosen because:
  - Contains A (position 2) and N (position 5), both in new valid positions.
  - Tests new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I.
  - Avoids repeated letters and excluded letters (C, R, E).
  - Provides broad positional coverage for A and N while probing new consonants and a vowel.

<thinking>
Feedback from first guess: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
- Absent letters: C, R, E
- Present letters: A, N (but not in positions 3 or 4)
- A must be in a new position (not 3): valid positions are 1, 2, 4, 5.
- N must be in a new position (not 4): valid positions are 1, 2, 3, 5.

Goal for second guess:
- Include A and N in new positions.
- Exclude C, R, E.
- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O, D, M, P, Y).

Evaluated candidates:
- ""PLANT"": Invalid (A in position 3, which is disallowed).
- ""PAINT"": Invalid (N in position 4, disallowed).
- ""NASTY"": Valid (A in 2, N in 1; tests S, T, Y), but places A and N adjacently, potentially limiting positional info.
- ""TANGO"": Valid (A in 2, N in 3; tests T, G, O), but G is less common.
- ""SATIN"": Valid (A in 2, N in 5; tests S, T, I). Spreads A and N apart, tests high-frequency letters (S, T, I), and avoids redundancy.

""SATIN"" is optimal:
- Tests 3 new letters (S, T, I) with high information value.
- Positions A and N in untried slots (A in 2, N in 5).
- Complies with all constraints.

<guess>SATIN</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SATIN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) T(x) I(x) N(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the second guess ""SATIN"":
  S: x (not in the word)
  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is in position 2)
  T: x (not in the word)
  I: x (not in the word)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The secret word has A in the second position (position 2).
- The letter N is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in SATIN and marked as wrong position).
- The letters S, T, I are not in the word.
- Additionally, from the first guess, we know C, R, E are not in the word, and A is in the word (now we know it's in position 2) and N is in the word (but not in position 4 or 5).

Summary of absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I
Present letters: A (fixed at position 2), N (present but not in position 4 or 5)

Now, we must choose a word that:
- Has A in position 2.
- Includes N (but not in position 4 or 5, so positions 1, 2, or 3; but position 2 is taken by A, so N can be in 1 or 3).
- Does not include C, R, E, S, T, I.

We also want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.

The secret word has 5 letters. We know one of them is A in position 2, and one is N (in position 1 or 3). So we have three more letters to discover.

Common letters not yet tested: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We should try to cover as many common letters as possible.

Since N can only be in position 1 or 3, we can consider two cases.

Let's try to form words with A in position 2 and N in position 1 or 3.

First, if N is in position 1:
  N _ A _ _ 
The third position is open, and then two more letters.

Second, if N is in position 3:
  _ _ N A _ 
But note: the second position is A, so if N is in position 3, then the word has: [letter1] A N [letter4] [letter5]

We don't know which case, so we might want to choose a word that tests one of these and also tests new letters.

But note: we have to include N, so we must choose one of the positions for N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 1 or 3 and also includes other new letters.

Let's list possible words.

First, try N in position 1:
  N _ A _ _ 
We need to fill the second blank (position 2 is A, so that's fixed) and positions 4 and 5.

But position 2 is A, so the word is: N A _ _ _

We need to choose three letters for positions 3,4,5, avoiding C,R,E,S,T,I and including N only once (since we don't have information about duplicates, but we assume no duplicates for now? Actually, we don't know, but we haven't seen duplicates so we can assume none until we have evidence).

But note: the feedback for SATIN had N in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position. That doesn't rule out that N might appear twice, but it's less likely. We'll assume no duplicates for efficiency.

So, for N in position 1: word pattern: N A _ _ _

We need to fill positions 3,4,5 with letters that are not C,R,E,S,T,I and are not N (since we assume no duplicate).

Possible words:
- ""NAVAL"": but V and L are allowed? Yes, but let's check: N A V A L -> but A is repeated? We have A in position 2 and 4? But we don't know if A is repeated. The feedback for CRANE had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but that doesn't mean there isn't another A. However, in SATIN, we had A in position 2 and it was correct, and no other A. But we don't know. To be safe, we should avoid assuming no duplicates for A? Actually, the feedback doesn't indicate duplicates, so we can try.

But let's see: in ""NAVAL"", we have A in position 2 (correct) and also in position 4. But we don't know if the word has two A's. However, we are trying to guess, so it's acceptable. But we are also testing V and L.

But note: we are putting N in position 1, which is a possibility.

Another word: ""NADIR"" -> but R is absent (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.

""NASTY"" -> but S and T are absent, so invalid.

""NABOB"" -> B and O, but not a common word? And we have two B's? ""NABOB"" is a word, but we are testing B and O.

But we want common words.

""NAHAL"" -> not common.

""NAKED"" -> E is absent, so invalid.

""NAPPY"" -> P and Y. Word: N A P P Y -> but P repeated? And we are testing P and Y.

But we don't know if P is in the word.

Another word: ""NAVAL"" as above.

But let's consider the other case: N in position 3.

Pattern: _ _ N A _ 
That is: [letter1] A N [letter4] [letter5]  (since position 2 is A, position 3 is N)

So the word: ? A N ? ?

We need to choose letters for positions 1,4,5, avoiding C,R,E,S,T,I.

Possible words:
- ""BANAL"": B A N A L -> but A repeated? And we are testing B and L.
- ""CANAL"" -> C is absent, invalid.
- ""DANDY"" -> D and Y. Word: D A N D Y -> D repeated? And we are testing D and Y.
- ""FANCY"" -> F and C? C is absent, invalid.
- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> tests H, D, Y. No duplicates. This seems good.
- ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.
- ""PANDA"": P A N D A -> A repeated, and D.
- ""WANLY"": W A N L Y -> tests W, L, Y.

We have two main cases: N in position 1 (pattern N A _ _ _) or N in position 3 (pattern _ A N _ _).

We need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and tests new letters.

But note: we don't know which pattern is correct, so we might want to choose a word that helps distinguish between these cases and also tests new letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in one of the allowed positions and tests multiple new common letters.

Given that we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.

Let's list the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, and others.

We have 3 or 4 new letters to test (depending on the pattern).

But note: in the pattern for N in position 1, we have three blanks (positions 3,4,5). In the pattern for N in position 3, we have three blanks (positions 1,4,5). So in both cases, we have three new letters to find.

We can try to use a word that has N in position 1 or 3 and includes three new common letters.

But we must decide the position for N.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't fix N to one position but tests both possibilities? That might be hard.

We know N must be in position 1 or 3. So we can choose a word that has N in one of these positions and then see the feedback.

I think it's better to pick one case and test it.

But which one? We don't have information to prefer one over the other.

We can choose a word that tests N in position 1 and also tests common letters, and if it's wrong, then N must be in position 3.

Similarly, we can do the opposite.

But we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.

Another idea: we can choose a word that has N in position 3 and also tests letters that are common, and then we can get information about the other positions.

Let me try to choose ""HANDY"": 
  H A N D Y
  This assumes N is in position 3 (so pattern _ A N _ _) and tests H, D, Y.

But if N is actually in position 1, then this word would not have N in position 3 and we would get feedback that N is not in the word? But we know N is in the word, so if we put N in position 3 and it's not there, then the feedback for N would be '-' (wrong position) or 'x' if it's not in the word at all? But we know it is in the word, so if we put it in position 3 and it's not there, it would be '-'. But we already know it's not in position 4 or 5, so if it's not in 3, then it must be in 1.

So by putting N in position 3, we can confirm if it is there or not.

Similarly, if we put N in position 1, we can see if it is there.

So let's choose a word that puts N in one of the positions, say position 3, and tests new letters.

I'll go with ""HANDY"": 
  H A N D Y
  - Position 1: H (new)
  - Position 2: A (correct, we know)
  - Position 3: N (we are testing if it is here)
  - Position 4: D (new)
  - Position 5: Y (new)

If N is in position 3, then we get a check for N. If not, then we get a '-' for N and we know it must be in position 1.

Additionally, we test H, D, Y.

But note: we are using a pattern that requires position 3 to be N. If it's not, then we know N is in 1.

But we are also testing three new letters.

Another candidate: ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.

But ""HANDY"" seems fine.

We could also test more common letters. For example, ""PANSY"" but S is absent, so invalid.

""BALDY"" -> B A L D Y -> but this doesn't have N? We must include N. So invalid.

We must include N.

So ""HANDY"" is a valid choice.

But let's see if there is a word that tests more common letters.

Common letters: L, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

What about ""ALONG""? But we don't have N in position 1 or 3? ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> but A is in position 1? But we need A in position 2. So invalid.

""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but I is absent, and also N is in position 5? But we know N is not in position 5 (from SATIN feedback: N in position 5 was wrong). So we cannot put N in 5. Also, I is absent.

""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> but T is absent, and N is in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4 (from CRANE: N in 4 was wrong). So invalid.

""LAUND"" -> not a word.

So ""HANDY"" seems reasonable.

Another option: ""BANAL"" -> B A N A L -> but A repeated? And we are testing B and L. But if there is no second A, then it might not be good. But we don't know.

""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> A repeated.

I think ""HANDY"" is a good choice.

So I'll go with ""HANDY"".Based on the feedback:
- A is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from SATIN).
- N is present but not in position 5 (from SATIN) and not in position 4 (from CRANE), so it must be in position 1 or 3.
- Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I.

Strategy for the next guess:
- Must include A in position 2 and N in either position 1 or 3.
- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., D, H, L, M, O, P, Y) while avoiding absent letters.

Chosen word: ""HANDY""
- Structure: H (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), N (position 3, testing if N is here), D (position 4), Y (position 5).
- Tests N in position 3 (if correct, we get confirmation; if not, N must be in position 1).
- Tests three new letters: H, D, Y (all common and untested).

<thinking>
Feedback from previous guesses:
1. CRANE: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x) → A and N present, but not in positions 3 and 4.
2. SATIN: S(x), A(✓), T(x), I(x), N(-) → A confirmed in position 2; N present but not in position 5; S, T, I absent.

Thus:
- A is fixed at position 2.
- N must be in position 1 or 3 (since positions 4 and 5 are invalid per feedback).
- Absent letters: C, E, R, S, T, I.

""HANDY"" is selected because:
- Complies with A in position 2.
- Places N in position 3 (one of the two possible positions).
- Tests new letters H, D, Y (high value for information gain).
- If N is in position 3, we get confirmation; if not, we learn N must be in position 1.
- Avoids all absent letters and repeats.
</thinking>

<guess>HANDY</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (CRANE)**: C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(absent).  
- **Guess 2 (SATIN)**: S(absent), A(correct position), T(absent), I(absent), N(present but wrong position).  

### Key Insights:
- **A** is confirmed in **position 2** (from SATIN's ✓).
- **N** is present but **not in position 4** (from CRANE) or **position 5** (from SATIN), so it must be in **position 1 or 3**.
- **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I (cannot be used).
- **Present letters**: A (fixed at position 2), N (must be in position 1 or 3).

### Strategy for Guess 3:
- Test **N in position 3** (to resolve its location—if not here, it must be in position 1).
- Use new high-frequency letters (e.g., **D, H, Y**) to maximize information.
- Avoid absent letters and respect A's fixed position.

### Chosen Guess: **HANDY**
- **H** (position 1): New letter test.
- **A** (position 2): Fixed (✓).
- **N** (position 3): Tests if N is here (if not, N must be in position 1).
- **D** (position 4): New letter test.
- **Y** (position 5): New letter test.

This guess efficiently narrows down N's position while probing three new common letters.

<guess>HANDY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SATIN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) T(x) I(x) N(-)
Guess 3: HANDY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have received feedback for the third guess ""HANDY"":
  H(x) -> not in the word
  A(✓) -> correct position (position 2) [already knew this]
  N(✓) -> correct position (position 3) [now we know N is in position 3]
  D(✓) -> correct position (position 4)
  Y(✓) -> correct position (position 5)

So, the feedback tells us:
- H is absent.
- A, N, D, Y are correct and in the positions we guessed.

Therefore, the secret word must be: 
  Position 1: ? (unknown)
  Position 2: A (correct)
  Position 3: N (correct)
  Position 4: D (correct)
  Position 5: Y (correct)

So the word pattern is: _ A N D Y

We only need to find the first letter.

Constraints:
- The first letter cannot be any of the absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, H (from HANDY feedback).
- It must be a letter that hasn't been eliminated and must form a valid English word.

We need to find words that fit the pattern _ A N D Y.

Common possibilities:
- BANDY
- CANDY -> but C is absent? From first guess: C is absent. So invalid.
- DANDY -> but D is already in position 4? And we are using Y in 5. But ""DANDY"" would be D in position 1, but we have D in position 4. Would that be allowed? Actually, we don't know if there are duplicate letters. However, in our feedback, we have D marked as correct in position 4. If we put D in position 1 as well, that might be possible, but we need to check.
  But note: in ""DANDY"", we have:
    Position 1: D
    Position 2: A
    Position 3: N
    Position 4: D
    Position 5: Y

  But we already know from the pattern that position 4 is D. So if the word has another D in position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we haven't tested for duplicates before? The feedback doesn't show duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess one in the correct position and one in a wrong position, it might show accordingly. But in HANDY, we had D in position 4 and it was correct. So if we try ""DANDY"", we are putting D in position 1 and position 4. If the word has D only once (at position 4), then position 1 would get an 'x' for D? Actually, no: because we are using D in two positions. The feedback might mark the one in position 4 as correct and the one in position 1 as absent (if there's only one D). But in our case, we know D is in position 4, so if there is no other D, then the D in position 1 would be marked absent.

  We haven't eliminated D for position 1? But we know D is in the word at position 4. So if the first letter is D, then the word has two D's. But we don't know if that's the case.

  We need to test.

  Alternatively, we can try another letter.

But first, let's list possible words ending in ""ANDY"" that are 5 letters.

Possible words:
- BANDY: B A N D Y
- CANDY: C A N D Y -> but C is absent? Yes, from first guess.
- DANDY: D A N D Y -> has two D's? But possible.
- FANDY: not a word? 
- GANDY: rare? 
- HANDY: we already tried, but H is absent, and we know the word isn't HANDY because H is absent and we didn't have it correct.
- MANDY: M A N D Y -> a valid word (e.g., a name or colloquial term).
- PANDY: P A N D Y -> valid in certain dialects (to strike on the palm) or as a name.
- RANDY: R A N D Y -> but R is absent? From first guess: R is absent. So invalid.
- SANDY: S A N D Y -> but S is absent? From SATIN: S is absent. So invalid.
- WANDY: not common? 
- VANDY: as in Vandy? abbreviation for Vanderbilt? Not universally recognized.

Common choices: BANDY, MANDY, PANDY, and DANDY.

But note:
- DANDY: has two D's. We know D is at position 4. If we try D in position 1, and if the word has only one D (at position 4), then position 1 would be marked absent. But if it has two D's, then position 1 might be marked correct or wrong position? We don't know.

We have limited guesses (we are at guess 4 of 6), so we can guess one of these.

Since we have multiple options, we should choose one that tests a new letter.

We haven't tested B, M, P, etc.

We don't know which one is correct.

But note: we know the first letter cannot be H, and cannot be any of the absent letters.

We can choose a word that has a single new letter for position 1, but we must form a valid word.

Alternatively, we can just guess one of the candidates.

But we have three possibilities: B, M, P for the first letter (and D, but that has duplication).

We should try the most common one or one that gives us information.

But since we are only missing the first letter, we can guess one.

Let me see the frequency: 
- ""BANDY"" means to pass from one to another, or have legs that curve outwards. 
- ""MANDY"" is a name.
- ""PANDY"" is a Scottish term for striking on the hand, or a name.
- ""DANDY"" is a well-known word.

""DANDY"" might be the most common.

But we need to check if D is allowed in position 1? We know D is in the word at position 4, so using D in position 1 might be acceptable if duplicated.

However, to be safe, we can choose a word that introduces a new letter.

I'll go with ""BANDY"" because it uses B, which hasn't been tested, and if it's not correct, we can eliminate B.

Similarly, if we try ""MANDY"", we test M.

But we have only one letter to guess, so we can pick one.

The system expects one guess.

Given that ""DANDY"" is a valid word and quite common, and we know the pattern is _ANDY, let's choose ""DANDY"". But note that if there is only one D, then the first letter D would be marked absent, and we would know it's not D.

But we can learn from that.

Alternatively, to avoid duplication, we can pick a word that doesn't use D in position 1.

Let me list: BANDY, MANDY, PANDY.

I think ""BANDY"" is a good choice because B is a common letter.

But we are only testing the first letter.

So I'll go ahead and choose ""BANDY"".

If it's not, then we try others.

But we have other options: LANDY? but L hasn't been tested? ""LANDY"" is not a standard word. Similarly, ""WANDY"" is not common.

So the realistic options are B, M, P, D.

We can pick ""BANDY"" as it tests B.

Therefore, I choose ""BANDY"".The secret word pattern is _ANDY, with A,N,D,Y confirmed in positions 2,3,4,5 respectively.  
From feedback:  
- All absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, H  
- Present letters: A, N, D, Y (fixed in positions 2-5).  

Thus:  
- Only position 1 is unknown.  
- Possible letters: Any unused consonants/vowels except absent letters.  
- Likely candidates: **B, M, P, D, G, etc.** but must form a valid word.  

Top valid options:  
1. **BANDY** (B in position 1)  
2. **DANDY** (D in position 1; possible duplicate D)  
3. **MANDY** (M in position 1)  
4. **PANDY** (P in position 1)  

Strategy:  
- Choose **BANDY** to test a new common letter (B) and avoid duplication risk.  
- If incorrect, proceed to test M or P next.  

<guess>BANDY</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - Guess 1 (CRANE): A and N are in the word but not in positions 3/4; C, R, E absent.
   - Guess 2 (SATIN): A is confirmed in position 2; N is present but not in position 5; S/T/I absent.
   - Guess 3 (HANDY): N in position 3, D in position 4, and Y in position 5 are correct; A (position 2) reconfirmed; H absent.

2. **Current Known Information**:
   - **Secret word pattern**: `_ A N D Y` (positions 2, 3, 4, 5 confirmed as A, N, D, Y respectively).
   - **Confirmed present letters**: A, N, D, Y (fixed positions).
   - **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I, H (excluded).
   - Position 1 must be a new letter (not absent) to form a valid English word.

3. **Deduction**:
   - Only position 1 is unknown.
   - Possible words: `?ANDY` (e.g., BANDY, DANDY, MANDY, PANDY, WANDY, etc.).
   - Common valid options: 
     - **BANDY** (B in position 1).
     - **DANDY** (D in position 1; risk of duplicate D but possible).
     - **MANDY** (M in position 1).
     - **PANDY** (P in position 1).
   - Test **BANDY**:
     - Uses B, a high-frequency unused consonant.
     - Avoids ambiguity (unlike DANDY, which may have duplicate D).
     - If incorrect, eliminates B and narrows to M/P/D in subsequent guesses.

<guess>BANDY</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: SATIN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) T(x) I(x) N(-)
Guess 3: HANDY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)
Guess 4: BANDY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback for the fourth guess ""BANDY"":
  B(x) -> B is absent
  A(✓) -> correct (position 2)
  N(✓) -> correct (position 3)
  D(✓) -> correct (position 4)
  Y(✓) -> correct (position 5)

This tells us:
- B is not the first letter and not in the word at all.
- The secret word remains in the pattern: _ A N D Y

Now, we know that the first letter cannot be B and cannot be any of the previously absent letters (C, R, E, S, T, I, H, and now B).

We need to find a word that fits _ A N D Y, using a letter that hasn't been eliminated.

Previously, we considered options like DANDY, MANDY, PANDY, etc.

Now we know B is absent, so ""BANDY"" is eliminated.

Next common possibilities:
- ""DANDY"": D in position 1. But note: we have D already in position 4. If the word has only one D, then the D in position 1 would be incorrect. But if it has two D's, it might be valid.
- ""MANDY"": M in position 1.
- ""PANDY"": P in position 1.
- ""WANDY"": less common, but possible? ""Wandy"" is not standard; ""WANDY"" might be a name or rare.
- ""GANDY"": could be a surname or place name.
- ""VANDY"": abbreviation for Vanderbilt, but informal.

Common English words: DANDY, MANDY, PANDY.

Since B is now absent, we can try ""MANDY"" next.

But note: we have only 2 guesses left (this is guess 5, and we started with 6).

We might as well try ""MANDY"". If it's wrong, then we try ""PANDY"" or ""DANDY"".

Alternatively, we could try ""DANDY"" because it's a common word.

But let's check: if ""DANDY"" is the secret word, then it has two D's: one in position 1 and one in position 4. We haven't considered duplicate letters before. The feedback for HANDY showed D as present only in position 4, but that doesn't indicate duplicates. Similarly, in BANDY, only position 4 D was correct.

In HANDY, we had D only in position 4 and it was correct. In BANDY, same. There's no indication that D appears elsewhere.

But we don't know for sure.

We might test ""MANDY"" to avoid duplication unless necessary.

I think ""DANDY"" is a valid word and we should consider it.

But to be systematic, let's try ""MANDY"" next.

So I'll choose ""MANDY"".Based on the feedback:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ANDY` (positions 2-5: A, N, D, Y confirmed).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I, H, **B** (new from BANDY).

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Position 1 candidates** must be a letter not in the absent list and form a valid word.
   - Likely options: 
     - **DANDY** (D in position 1; risk of duplicate D but possible).
     - **MANDY** (M in position 1).
     - **PANDY** (P in position 1).
2. **Strategy**:
   - Test **MANDY** next: 
     - Uses a new common letter (M).
     - If correct: solved. If not, eliminates M and leaves D/P as options.
```json
{""thoughts"": ""Position 1 must be M, D, or P. Testing MANDY maximizes new information by covering a previously untested high-frequency consonant (M).""}
```

<guess>MANDY</guess>The feedback confirms:
- The secret word is `_ A N D Y` (positions 2–5 are fixed as A, N, D, Y).
- New absent letter: **B** (from position 1 of ""BANDY"").
- Updated absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, H, B.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Eliminated letters** (absent):  
   C, R, E, S, T, I, H, B.  
2. **Remaining task**:  
   Deduce position 1 (unknown) from unused letters to form a valid ""?ANDY"" word.  
3. **Top candidates**:  
   - `DANDY` (D in position 1; possible duplicate D)  
   - `MANDY` (M in position 1)  
   - `PANDY` (P in position 1)  
4. **Strategy**:  
   Prioritize `MANDY` to test a new common consonant (**M**) and avoid duplication ambiguity (unlike `DANDY`).  
   If incorrect, `DANDY` or `PANDY` can be tried next.

Actually: \n      P L A N T -> A is in position 3, but in the first guess ""CRANE"", A was in position 3 and we know it\'s not in that position. So we cannot put A in position 3 again.

Actually, we can only avoid C, R, E. But ""MANGO"" has O and G. However, we must avoid E? It doesn\'t have E. But wait, we are avoiding C, R, E. So ""MANGO"" is okay? But let\'s check positions:\n  M A N G O -> A is in position 2 (okay, not 3), N is in position 3 (okay, not 4). \nBut we also have to consider that the word must be valid. However, note that the feedback for the first guess said A and N are present, so we must include them.\n\nBut wait: ""MANGO"" has the letter O and G, which we haven\'t tested. However, we are allowed to use any letters except C, R, E.\n\nBut is ""MANGO"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nBut we can do better: we want to test more common letters. Also, we have two new letters: M and G and O. That\'s three new letters.

Yes, but it has C? C is not allowed (we know C is absent). So invalid.\n\n""LANTS"" -> not a common word? Actually, we need a valid English word. ""LANT"" is not common, but ""SLANT"" is.\n\n""SLANT"": \n  S L A N T -> \n    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because in CRANE, A was in 3 and it was wrong position, so it cannot be in 3 again). \n  So invalid.\n\n""TAKEN"" -> but E is not allowed? We know E is absent, so we cannot use E. So invalid.\n\n""TANGO"": \n  T A N G O -> \n    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 3 (okay). \n  This uses T, G, O.\n\nBut note: we are putting N in position 3, which is new (previously it was in 4). So that\'s acceptable.\n\nHowever, we have two candidates: ""NASTY"" and ""TANGO"". \n\nWe want to maximize information. In ""NASTY"", we are testing N at position 1 and A at position 2, and also S, T, Y. In ""TANGO"", we are testing T, A, N, G, O.\n\nWe also note that we have two letters we know are in the word (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions and also discover other letters.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to use a word that has A and N and also includes other common letters that we haven\'t eliminated, such as S, T, L, O, I, D, etc.\n\nBut we must avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N.\n\nLet me try to list words that have A and N, without C, R, E, and with A not in 3 and N not in 4.\n\n- ""DAISY"": D A I S Y -> A in 2 (okay), but no N? We must include N. So invalid.\n\n- ""PAINS"": P A I N S -> A in 2 (okay), N in 4 -> not allowed.\n\n- ""MAINS"": same issue, N in 4.\n\n- ""SAUNA"": S A U N A -> A in 2 and 5, N in 4 -> N in 4 is not allowed.\n\n- ""BANJO"": B A N J O -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses B, J, O.\n\nBut J is not very common. We might get less information.\n\n- ""WAGON"": W A G O N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses W, G, O.\n\n- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses H, D, Y.\n\n- ""PANSY"": P A N S Y -> A in 2 (okay), N in 3 (okay). This uses P, S, Y.\n\n""PANSY"" seems good: \n  Positions: \n    P (1), A (2), N (3), S (4), Y (5)\n  A is in 2 (new, not 3) -> okay\n  N is in 3 (new, not 4) -> okay\n  We are testing P, S, Y which are common.\n\nBut note: we are putting N in position 3. Is that acceptable? Yes, because the feedback only said that N is not in position 4, but it could be in 3.\n\nSimilarly, A is in 2, which is acceptable.\n\nAnother candidate: ""NADIR"": but R is not allowed? We know R is absent. So invalid.\n\n""LATIN"": L A T I N -> A in 2 (okay), N in 5 (okay). This uses L, T, I.\n\nBut we don\'t have the letter S? We might want to test S because it\'s very common.\n\nWe have to choose one.\n\nI think ""PANSY"" is a good choice because it tests three new common letters (P, S, Y) and places A and N in new positions.\n\nAlternatively, ""NASTY"" is also good: \n  N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5. \n  This tests N at the start (which we haven\'t tried) and A in 2, and also S, T, Y.\n\nBut note: in ""NASTY"", we are putting A in position 2 and N in position 1. We know that A is in the word but not in position 3, and N is in the word but not in position 4. So positions 1 and 2 for N and A are both new.\n\nHowever, we are using two positions that we haven\'t tested for A and N. \n\nBut we have to be cautious: if we put both A and N in new positions, we might get more information about their correct positions.\n\nBut also, we are testing three new letters: S, T, Y.\n\nSimilarly, ""PANSY"" tests P, S, Y and puts A in 2 and N in 3.\n\nI think both are reasonable. But let me see which one covers more common letters.\n\nThe frequency of letters in English words (for 5-letter words) might help. Common letters: S, T, L, N (but we already know N), A (we know A), then P, O, I, etc.\n\nS and T are very common. So both ""NASTY"" and ""PANSY"" have S and T? Actually, ""PANSY"" has S and Y, but not T. ""NASTY"" has S, T, and Y.\n\nSo ""NASTY"" tests T as well, which is more common than P.\n\nTherefore, I think ""NASTY"" is a better choice.\n\nBut wait: in ""NASTY"", we are putting N in position 1. We don\'t know if that is correct. Similarly, A in position 2. But that\'s the point: we are testing these positions.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose a word that doesn\'t put A and N in adjacent positions to get more positional information.\n\nBut I think ""NASTY"" is a solid choice.\n\nAnother candidate: ""STAIN"" -> \n  S T A I N -> \n    A in position 3 -> not allowed (because we know A is not in position 3). So invalid.\n\n""SATIN"": \n  S A T I N -> \n    A in position 2 (okay), N in position 5 (okay). \n  This uses S, T, I.\n\nBut note: we are putting A in 2 and N in 5. This is acceptable.\n\nAnd we are testing S, T, I.\n\nBut we are not testing Y? That\'s okay. We can test Y later.\n\n""SATIN"" is also a good candidate because it uses very common letters.\n\nBut we already know that A and N are in the word, so we are focusing on finding their positions and discovering other letters.\n\nBetween ""NASTY"" and ""SATIN"", which one?\n\n""NASTY"": tests N in 1, A in 2, S in 3, T in 4, Y in 5.\n""SATIN"": tests S in 1, A in 2, T in 3, I in 4, N in 5.\n\nWe know that A is not in 3, so in ""SATIN"", T is in 3 and that\'s a new letter in that position. Also, we are testing I.\n\nBut note: we have no information about I, so it\'s good to test.\n\nHowever, in ""NASTY"", we are testing Y which is less common than I? Actually, I is more common.\n\nBut we are also testing T in both. \n\nI think ""SATIN"" might be better because it uses I (a common vowel) and avoids putting two known letters (A and N) in the first two positions, which might be less likely? Not necessarily.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we have two known letters (A and N) and we are trying to find their positions. In ""SATIN"", we are putting A in 2 and N in 5, which are two different positions. In ""NASTY"", we are putting both at the front.\n\nWe might get more information if we spread them out.\n\nBut I don\'t have a strong preference.\n\nAnother candidate: ""POINT"" -> but we must include A and N? We cannot leave out A or N because we know they are in the word. So we must include both.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word that contains both A and N.\n\nAfter considering, I think ""SATIN"" is a good choice because:\n- It uses common letters: S, A, T, I, N.\n- It places A in position 2 (which is new) and N in position 5 (which is new, since previously N was in 4).\n- It tests the vowel I, which is common.\n\nAlternatively, ""TAINT"" -> but T is repeated? We want to avoid repeated letters to maximize information. ""TAINT"" has two T\'s. So not ideal.\n\n""SAINT"" is invalid because N is in 4.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SATIN"".\n\nBut let me confirm: \n  S A T I N\n  A is in position 2 (which is not 3, so okay)\n  N is in position 5 (which is not 4, so okay)\n\nAnd the word is valid.\n\nWe are testing S, T, I, and we already know A and N are present.\n\nSo we can get information about S, T, I and the positions of A and N.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""SATIN"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- C, R, and E are absent from the secret word.\n- A and N are present but not in positions 3 or 4 (as indicated by the ""-"" symbols).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include A and N (since they are in the secret word).\n- Must exclude C, R, and E (since they are absent).\n- A cannot be in position 3, and N cannot be in position 4 (to avoid repeating invalid positions).\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O) to maximize information.\n\nAfter evaluating options:\n- ""SATIN"" is chosen because:\n  - Contains A (position 2) and N (position 5), both in new valid positions.\n  - Tests new high-frequency letters: S, T, and I.\n  - Avoids repeated letters and excluded letters (C, R, E).\n  - Provides broad positional coverage for A and N while probing new consonants and a vowel.\n\n<thinking>\nFeedback from first guess: CRANE → C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)\n- Absent letters: C, R, E\n- Present letters: A, N (but not in positions 3 or 4)\n- A must be in a new position (not 3): valid positions are 1, 2, 4, 5.\n- N must be in a new position (not 4): valid positions are 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\nGoal for second guess:\n- Include A and N in new positions.\n- Exclude C, R, E.\n- Test new common letters (e.g., S, T, I, L, O, D, M, P, Y).\n\nEvaluated candidates:\n- ""PLANT"": Invalid (A in position 3, which is disallowed).\n- ""PAINT"": Invalid (N in position 4, disallowed).\n- ""NASTY"": Valid (A in 2, N in 1; tests S, T, Y), but places A and N adjacently, potentially limiting positional info.\n- ""TANGO"": Valid (A in 2, N in 3; tests T, G, O), but G is less common.\n- ""SATIN"": Valid (A in 2, N in 5; tests S, T, I). Spreads A and N apart, tests high-frequency letters (S, T, I), and avoids redundancy.\n\n""SATIN"" is optimal:\n- Tests 3 new letters (S, T, I) with high information value.\n- Positions A and N in untried slots (A in 2, N in 5).\n- Complies with all constraints.\n</thinking>\n\n<guess>SATIN</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SATIN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) T(x) I(x) N(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the second guess ""SATIN"":\n  S: x (not in the word)\n  A: ✓ (correct position, so A is in position 2)\n  T: x (not in the word)\n  I: x (not in the word)\n  N: - (in the word but wrong position)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word has A in the second position (position 2).\n- The letter N is in the word but not in position 5 (since it was in position 5 in SATIN and marked as wrong position).\n- The letters S, T, I are not in the word.\n- Additionally, from the first guess, we know C, R, E are not in the word, and A is in the word (now we know it\'s in position 2) and N is in the word (but not in position 4 or 5).\n\nSummary of absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I\nPresent letters: A (fixed at position 2), N (present but not in position 4 or 5)\n\nNow, we must choose a word that:\n- Has A in position 2.\n- Includes N (but not in position 4 or 5, so positions 1, 2, or 3; but position 2 is taken by A, so N can be in 1 or 3).\n- Does not include C, R, E, S, T, I.\n\nWe also want to test new common letters to find the remaining letters.\n\nThe secret word has 5 letters.

Actually, we don\'t know, but we haven\'t seen duplicates so we can assume none until we have evidence).\n\nBut note: the feedback for SATIN had N in position 5 and it was marked as present but wrong position.

Yes, but let\'s check: N A V A L -> but A is repeated? We have A in position 2 and 4? But we don\'t know if A is repeated. The feedback for CRANE had A in position 3 and it was wrong, but that doesn\'t mean there isn\'t another A. However, in SATIN, we had A in position 2 and it was correct, and no other A. But we don\'t know. To be safe, we should avoid assuming no duplicates for A? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t indicate duplicates, so we can try.\n\nBut let\'s see: in ""NAVAL"", we have A in position 2 (correct) and also in position 4. But we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. However, we are trying to guess, so it\'s acceptable. But we are also testing V and L.\n\nBut note: we are putting N in position 1, which is a possibility.\n\nAnother word: ""NADIR"" -> but R is absent (we know R is not in the word). So invalid.\n\n""NASTY"" -> but S and T are absent, so invalid.\n\n""NABOB"" -> B and O, but not a common word? And we have two B\'s? ""NABOB"" is a word, but we are testing B and O.\n\nBut we want common words.\n\n""NAHAL"" -> not common.\n\n""NAKED"" -> E is absent, so invalid.\n\n""NAPPY"" -> P and Y.

A N ? ?\n\nWe need to choose letters for positions 1,4,5, avoiding C,R,E,S,T,I.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BANAL"": B A N A L -> but A repeated? And we are testing B and L.\n- ""CANAL"" -> C is absent, invalid.\n- ""DANDY"" -> D and Y. Word: D A N D Y -> D repeated? And we are testing D and Y.\n- ""FANCY"" -> F and C? C is absent, invalid.\n- ""HANDY"": H A N D Y -> tests H, D, Y. No duplicates. This seems good.\n- ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.\n- ""PANDA"": P A N D A -> A repeated, and D.\n- ""WANLY"": W A N L Y -> tests W, L, Y.\n\nWe have two main cases: N in position 1 (pattern N A _ _ _) or N in position 3 (pattern _ A N _ _).\n\nWe need to choose a word that fits one of these patterns and tests new letters.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know which pattern is correct, so we might want to choose a word that helps distinguish between these cases and also tests new letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has N in one of the allowed positions and tests multiple new common letters.\n\nGiven that we have limited guesses, we should try to cover as many new letters as possible.\n\nLet\'s list the available letters: B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, U, V, W, Y, and others.\n\nWe have 3 or 4 new letters to test (depending on the pattern).\n\nBut note: in the pattern for N in position 1, we have three blanks (positions 3,4,5). In the pattern for N in position 3, we have three blanks (positions 1,4,5). So in both cases, we have three new letters to find.\n\nWe can try to use a word that has N in position 1 or 3 and includes three new common letters.\n\nBut we must decide the position for N.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t fix N to one position but tests both possibilities? That might be hard.\n\nWe know N must be in position 1 or 3. So we can choose a word that has N in one of these positions and then see the feedback.\n\nI think it\'s better to pick one case and test it.\n\nBut which one? We don\'t have information to prefer one over the other.\n\nWe can choose a word that tests N in position 1 and also tests common letters, and if it\'s wrong, then N must be in position 3.\n\nSimilarly, we can do the opposite.\n\nBut we have only 4 guesses left, so we need to be efficient.\n\nAnother idea: we can choose a word that has N in position 3 and also tests letters that are common, and then we can get information about the other positions.\n\nLet me try to choose ""HANDY"": \n  H A N D Y\n  This assumes N is in position 3 (so pattern _ A N _ _) and tests H, D, Y.\n\nBut if N is actually in position 1, then this word would not have N in position 3 and we would get feedback that N is not in the word? But we know N is in the word, so if we put N in position 3 and it\'s not there, then the feedback for N would be \'-\' (wrong position) or \'x\' if it\'s not in the word at all? But we know it is in the word, so if we put it in position 3 and it\'s not there, it would be \'-\'. But we already know it\'s not in position 4 or 5, so if it\'s not in 3, then it must be in 1.\n\nSo by putting N in position 3, we can confirm if it is there or not.\n\nSimilarly, if we put N in position 1, we can see if it is there.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word that puts N in one of the positions, say position 3, and tests new letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""HANDY"": \n  H A N D Y\n  - Position 1: H (new)\n  - Position 2: A (correct, we know)\n  - Position 3: N (we are testing if it is here)\n  - Position 4: D (new)\n  - Position 5: Y (new)\n\nIf N is in position 3, then we get a check for N. If not, then we get a \'-\' for N and we know it must be in position 1.\n\nAdditionally, we test H, D, Y.\n\nBut note: we are using a pattern that requires position 3 to be N. If it\'s not, then we know N is in 1.\n\nBut we are also testing three new letters.\n\nAnother candidate: ""MANLY"": M A N L Y -> tests M, L, Y.\n\nBut ""HANDY"" seems fine.\n\nWe could also test more common letters. For example, ""PANSY"" but S is absent, so invalid.\n\n""BALDY"" -> B A L D Y -> but this doesn\'t have N? We must include N.

But we don\'t have N in position 1 or 3? ""ALONG"": A L O N G -> but A is in position 1? But we need A in position 2. So invalid.\n\n""PLAIN"" -> P L A I N -> but I is absent, and also N is in position 5? But we know N is not in position 5 (from SATIN feedback: N in position 5 was wrong). So we cannot put N in 5. Also, I is absent.\n\n""DAUNT"" -> D A U N T -> but T is absent, and N is in position 4? But we know N is not in position 4 (from CRANE: N in 4 was wrong). So invalid.\n\n""LAUND"" -> not a word.\n\nSo ""HANDY"" seems reasonable.\n\nAnother option: ""BANAL"" -> B A N A L -> but A repeated? And we are testing B and L. But if there is no second A, then it might not be good. But we don\'t know.\n\n""MANGA"" -> M A N G A -> A repeated.\n\nI think ""HANDY"" is a good choice.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""HANDY"".Based on the feedback:\n- A is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from SATIN).\n- N is present but not in position 5 (from SATIN) and not in position 4 (from CRANE), so it must be in position 1 or 3.\n- Absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I.\n\nStrategy for the next guess:\n- Must include A in position 2 and N in either position 1 or 3.\n- Test new high-frequency letters (e.g., D, H, L, M, O, P, Y) while avoiding absent letters.\n\nChosen word: ""HANDY""\n- Structure: H (position 1), A (position 2, fixed), N (position 3, testing if N is here), D (position 4), Y (position 5).\n- Tests N in position 3 (if correct, we get confirmation; if not, N must be in position 1).\n- Tests three new letters: H, D, Y (all common and untested).\n\n<thinking>\nFeedback from previous guesses:\n1.

From first guess: C is absent. So invalid.\n- DANDY -> but D is already in position 4? And we are using Y in 5. But ""DANDY"" would be D in position 1, but we have D in position 4. Would that be allowed? Actually, we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. However, in our feedback, we have D marked as correct in position 4. If we put D in position 1 as well, that might be possible, but we need to check.\n  But note: in ""DANDY"", we have:\n    Position 1: D\n    Position 2: A\n    Position 3: N\n    Position 4: D\n    Position 5: Y\n\n  But we already know from the pattern that position 4 is D. So if the word has another D in position 1, that would be a duplicate. But we haven\'t tested for duplicates before? The feedback doesn\'t show duplicates explicitly? Actually, in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess one in the correct position and one in a wrong position, it might show accordingly. But in HANDY, we had D in position 4 and it was correct. So if we try ""DANDY"", we are putting D in position 1 and position 4. If the word has D only once (at position 4), then position 1 would get an \'x\' for D? Actually, no: because we are using D in two positions. The feedback might mark the one in position 4 as correct and the one in position 1 as absent (if there\'s only one D). But in our case, we know D is in position 4, so if there is no other D, then the D in position 1 would be marked absent.\n\n  We haven\'t eliminated D for position 1? But we know D is in the word at position 4. So if the first letter is D, then the word has two D\'s. But we don\'t know if that\'s the case.\n\n  We need to test.\n\n  Alternatively, we can try another letter.\n\nBut first, let\'s list possible words ending in ""ANDY"" that are 5 letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- BANDY: B A N D Y\n- CANDY: C A N D Y -> but C is absent? Yes, from first guess.\n- DANDY: D A N D Y -> has two D\'s? But possible.\n- FANDY: not a word? \n- GANDY: rare? \n- HANDY: we already tried, but H is absent, and we know the word isn\'t HANDY because H is absent and we didn\'t have it correct.\n- MANDY: M A N D Y -> a valid word (e.g., a name or colloquial term).\n- PANDY: P A N D Y -> valid in certain dialects (to strike on the palm) or as a name.\n- RANDY: R A N D Y -> but R is absent? From first guess: R is absent. So invalid.\n- SANDY: S A N D Y -> but S is absent? From SATIN: S is absent. So invalid.\n- WANDY: not common? \n- VANDY: as in Vandy? abbreviation for Vanderbilt? Not universally recognized.\n\nCommon choices: BANDY, MANDY, PANDY, and DANDY.\n\nBut note:\n- DANDY: has two D\'s. We know D is at position 4. If we try D in position 1, and if the word has only one D (at position 4), then position 1 would be marked absent. But if it has two D\'s, then position 1 might be marked correct or wrong position? We don\'t know.\n\nWe have limited guesses (we are at guess 4 of 6), so we can guess one of these.\n\nSince we have multiple options, we should choose one that tests a new letter.\n\nWe haven\'t tested B, M, P, etc.\n\nWe don\'t know which one is correct.\n\nBut note: we know the first letter cannot be H, and cannot be any of the absent letters.\n\nWe can choose a word that has a single new letter for position 1, but we must form a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, we can just guess one of the candidates.\n\nBut we have three possibilities: B, M, P for the first letter (and D, but that has duplication).\n\nWe should try the most common one or one that gives us information.\n\nBut since we are only missing the first letter, we can guess one.\n\nLet me see the frequency: \n- ""BANDY"" means to pass from one to another, or have legs that curve outwards. \n- ""MANDY"" is a name.\n- ""PANDY"" is a Scottish term for striking on the hand, or a name.\n- ""DANDY"" is a well-known word.\n\n""DANDY"" might be the most common.\n\nBut we need to check if D is allowed in position 1? We know D is in the word at position 4, so using D in position 1 might be acceptable if duplicated.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we can choose a word that introduces a new letter.\n\nI\'ll go with ""BANDY"" because it uses B, which hasn\'t been tested, and if it\'s not correct, we can eliminate B.\n\nSimilarly, if we try ""MANDY"", we test M.\n\nBut we have only one letter to guess, so we can pick one.\n\nThe system expects one guess.\n\nGiven that ""DANDY"" is a valid word and quite common, and we know the pattern is _ANDY, let\'s choose ""DANDY"". But note that if there is only one D, then the first letter D would be marked absent, and we would know it\'s not D.\n\nBut we can learn from that.\n\nAlternatively, to avoid duplication, we can pick a word that doesn\'t use D in position 1.\n\nLet me list: BANDY, MANDY, PANDY.\n\nI think ""BANDY"" is a good choice because B is a common letter.\n\nBut we are only testing the first letter.\n\nSo I\'ll go ahead and choose ""BANDY"".\n\nIf it\'s not, then we try others.\n\nBut we have other options: LANDY? but L hasn\'t been tested? ""LANDY"" is not a standard word. Similarly, ""WANDY"" is not common.\n\nSo the realistic options are B, M, P, D.\n\nWe can pick ""BANDY"" as it tests B.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""BANDY"".The secret word pattern is _ANDY, with A,N,D,Y confirmed in positions 2,3,4,5 respectively.  \nFrom feedback:  \n- All absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, H  \n- Present letters: A, N, D, Y (fixed in positions 2-5).  \n\nThus:  \n- Only position 1 is unknown.  \n- Possible letters: Any unused consonants/vowels except absent letters.  \n- Likely candidates: **B, M, P, D, G, etc.** but must form a valid word.  \n\nTop valid options:  \n1. **BANDY** (B in position 1)  \n2. **DANDY** (D in position 1; possible duplicate D)  \n3. **MANDY** (M in position 1)  \n4. **PANDY** (P in position 1)  \n\nStrategy:  \n- Choose **BANDY** to test a new common letter (B) and avoid duplication risk.  \n- If incorrect, proceed to test M or P next.  \n\n<guess>BANDY</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n1. **Feedback from Previous Guesses**:\n   - Guess 1 (CRANE): A and N are in the word but not in positions 3/4; C, R, E absent.\n   - Guess 2 (SATIN): A is confirmed in position 2; N is present but not in position 5; S/T/I absent.\n   - Guess 3 (HANDY): N in position 3, D in position 4, and Y in position 5 are correct; A (position 2) reconfirmed; H absent.\n\n2. **Current Known Information**:\n   - **Secret word pattern**: `_ A N D Y` (positions 2, 3, 4, 5 confirmed as A, N, D, Y respectively).\n   - **Confirmed present letters**: A, N, D, Y (fixed positions).\n   - **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I, H (excluded).\n   - Position 1 must be a new letter (not absent) to form a valid English word.\n\n3. **Deduction**:\n   - Only position 1 is unknown.\n   - Possible words: `?ANDY` (e.g., BANDY, DANDY, MANDY, PANDY, WANDY, etc.).\n   - Common valid options: \n     - **BANDY** (B in position 1).\n     - **DANDY** (D in position 1; risk of duplicate D but possible).\n     - **MANDY** (M in position 1).\n     - **PANDY** (P in position 1).\n   - Test **BANDY**:\n     - Uses B, a high-frequency unused consonant.\n     - Avoids ambiguity (unlike DANDY, which may have duplicate D).\n     - If incorrect, eliminates B and narrows to M/P/D in subsequent guesses.\n\n<guess>BANDY</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: CRANE -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SATIN -> FEEDBACK: S(x) A(✓) T(x) I(x) N(-)\nGuess 3: HANDY -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: BANDY -> FEEDBACK: B(x) A(✓) N(✓) D(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback for the fourth guess ""BANDY"":\n  B(x) -> B is absent\n  A(✓) -> correct (position 2)\n  N(✓) -> correct (position 3)\n  D(✓) -> correct (position 4)\n  Y(✓) -> correct (position 5)\n\nThis tells us:\n- B is not the first letter and not in the word at all.\n- The secret word remains in the pattern: _ A N D Y\n\nNow, we know that the first letter cannot be B and cannot be any of the previously absent letters (C, R, E, S, T, I, H, and now B).\n\nWe need to find a word that fits _ A N D Y, using a letter that hasn\'t been eliminated.\n\nPreviously, we considered options like DANDY, MANDY, PANDY, etc.\n\nNow we know B is absent, so ""BANDY"" is eliminated.\n\nNext common possibilities:\n- ""DANDY"": D in position 1. But note: we have D already in position 4. If the word has only one D, then the D in position 1 would be incorrect. But if it has two D\'s, it might be valid.\n- ""MANDY"": M in position 1.\n- ""PANDY"": P in position 1.\n- ""WANDY"": less common, but possible? ""Wandy"" is not standard; ""WANDY"" might be a name or rare.\n- ""GANDY"": could be a surname or place name.\n- ""VANDY"": abbreviation for Vanderbilt, but informal.\n\nCommon English words: DANDY, MANDY, PANDY.\n\nSince B is now absent, we can try ""MANDY"" next.\n\nBut note: we have only 2 guesses left (this is guess 5, and we started with 6).\n\nWe might as well try ""MANDY"". If it\'s wrong, then we try ""PANDY"" or ""DANDY"".\n\nAlternatively, we could try ""DANDY"" because it\'s a common word.\n\nBut let\'s check: if ""DANDY"" is the secret word, then it has two D\'s: one in position 1 and one in position 4. We haven\'t considered duplicate letters before. The feedback for HANDY showed D as present only in position 4, but that doesn\'t indicate duplicates. Similarly, in BANDY, only position 4 D was correct.\n\nIn HANDY, we had D only in position 4 and it was correct. In BANDY, same. There\'s no indication that D appears elsewhere.\n\nBut we don\'t know for sure.\n\nWe might test ""MANDY"" to avoid duplication unless necessary.\n\nI think ""DANDY"" is a valid word and we should consider it.\n\nBut to be systematic, let\'s try ""MANDY"" next.\n\nSo I\'ll choose ""MANDY"".Based on the feedback:\n- **Secret word pattern**: `_ANDY` (positions 2-5: A, N, D, Y confirmed).\n- **Absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I, H, **B** (new from BANDY).\n\n### Step-by-Step:\n1. **Position 1 candidates** must be a letter not in the absent list and form a valid word.\n   - Likely options: \n     - **DANDY** (D in position 1; risk of duplicate D but possible).\n     - **MANDY** (M in position 1).\n     - **PANDY** (P in position 1).\n2. **Strategy**:\n   - Test **MANDY** next: \n     - Uses a new common letter (M).\n     - If correct: solved.

So, the secret word remains: _ A N D Y

Now, we know M is absent, and we have previously eliminated B, C, E, H, I, R, S, T.

Updated list of absent letters: C, R, E, S, T, I, H, B, M.

We need to find a letter for position 1 that forms a valid English word, is not in the absent list, and fits the pattern.

Possible words:
- ""PANDY"": P in position 1. If we try this, we can test P.
- ""DANDY"": D in position 1. This would mean two D's in the word (if correct), which is possible since we've only seen D in position 4 and the feedback didn't indicate duplicates.
- ""WANDY"": Less common, but possible? ""Wandy"" is not a standard word; it might be a name.
- ""GANDY"": ""Gandy"" is a surname.
- ""VANDY"": Abbreviation for Vanderbilt.

Common words: ""DANDY"" is a word meaning a man very concerned about his clothes and appearance. ""PANDY"" is a lesser-known word (e.g., Scottish for a strike on the hand).

Since we have eliminated many letters, and ""DANDY"" is a common word, we should try that next.

We are on the sixth guess (last one), so we must make it count.

We know that if ""DANDY"" is correct, then position 1 is D. If not, we lose, but there might be other options? But we've eliminated most common letters.

Other possibilities? ""ANDY"" is 4 letters. We need 5.

""RANDY"" -> but R is absent.
""SANDY"" -> S absent.
""CANDY"" -> C absent.
""BANDY"" -> B absent.
""HANDY"" -> H absent.
""MANDY"" -> M absent.

So ""PANDY"" and ""DANDY"" are the main candidates.

We haven't tested P yet, so we could try ""PANDY"". But if we try one and it's wrong, we lose.

But we have to choose one.

Given that ""DANDY"" is a more common word than ""PANDY"", I think it's likely the secret word.

Therefore, I will guess ""DANDY"".

If it's not, we lose, but we have no other realistic choices.

So final guess: ""DANDY"".
</think>
The secret word remains `_ A N D Y`, with positions 2–5 confirmed as `A, N, D, Y`.  
- **New absent letter**: **M** (from ""MANDY"" position 1).  
- **Total absent letters**: C, R, E, S, T, I, H, B, M.  

### Deduction:
- Only position 1 is unknown, and it **cannot** be any absent letter.  
- Possible candidates:  
  - `DANDY` (D in position 1; valid duplicate D).  
  - `PANDY` (P in position 1).  
- `DANDY` is the most common valid word fitting the pattern.  

### Strategy:  
Guess `DANDY` to resolve position 1 (D), as duplicates are possible and consistent with existing feedback.  
- If correct, solved.  
- If incorrect, `PANDY` would be the last option (but only 6 guesses allowed; this is guess 6).
