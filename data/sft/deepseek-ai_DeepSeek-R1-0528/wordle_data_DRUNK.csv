We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
 This means:
   - R is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 2).
   - N is in the secret word and in the correct position (position 4).
   - C, A, and E are not in the secret word at all.

 So, the secret word has the form: _ R _ N _

 We know the letters C, A, E are not in the word. Also, note that the word must be 5 letters.

 Now, we need to make a second guess. We should try to use a word that:
   - Has R in the second position and N in the fourth position.
   - Does not use the letters C, A, E (since they are not in the word).
   - Uses other common letters to try to uncover more of the word.

 Let's think of possible letters for the other positions.

 We have to avoid: C, A, E (and also note that we already know R and N are in the word, so we don't need to test them again in the same positions, but we might test for other letters).

 The word structure: [1] R [3] N [5]

 We can try to use a word that has the same R and N in positions 2 and 4, and uses new letters for positions 1, 3, and 5.

 Since we have two correct letters already, we can focus on finding the remaining three.

 Let's list some common consonants and vowels that we haven't tried. We haven't used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 But note: we must avoid A, C, E.

 We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's try to think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ N _

 Some examples:
   - ""IRONY"" -> I, R, O, N, Y -> but we don't know if I, O, Y are in the word.
   - ""URBAN"" -> U, R, B, A, N -> but A is already excluded, so invalid.
   - ""GROIN"" -> G, R, O, I, N -> this fits: G at position 1, R at 2, O at 3, I at 4? Wait, no: position 4 must be N, so the fourth letter is N, so we need the third letter to be O and the fifth to be something? Actually, ""GROIN"" has N at position 5, not 4. So it doesn't fit the pattern.

 We need the fourth letter to be N. So the word must be: [1] R [3] N [5]

 Let me think of words that have R in the second position and N in the fourth:
   - ""CRANE"" was already tried and we know C and A are not in the word, and E is not.
   - ""DRINK"": D, R, I, N, K -> positions: D(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> this fits the pattern.
   - ""GRIND"": G, R, I, N, D -> G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> fits.
   - ""TRUNK"": T, R, U, N, K -> T(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> fits.

 But note: we must avoid the letters C, A, E. So all these words (DRINK, GRIND, TRUNK) are acceptable because they don't contain C, A, or E.

 We can choose one of these. Let's pick ""DRINK"" because it uses common letters.

 However, we also want to test as many new letters as possible. In ""DRINK"", we are testing D, I, K (and we already know R and N are in the word and in the correct positions). So we are testing three new letters: D, I, K.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a vowel we haven't tried (like O, U, I) and some consonants.

 Since we have two correct letters, we can also try to get information about the other positions.

 Let me see: the word ""PRONG"" -> P, R, O, N, G -> but the fifth letter is G, and we have O at position 3. This is a valid word? Actually, ""PRONG"" is a word.

 But note: we are avoiding A, C, E. So ""PRONG"" is acceptable.

 However, we have to consider that we are only on the second guess, so we can choose a word that might help us narrow down more possibilities.

 I think ""DRINK"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can see if D, I, or K are in the word.

 Alternatively, we could use ""TREND"" but note: the fourth letter must be N, and in ""TREND"" the fourth letter is D, not N. So that doesn't fit.

 Another option: ""BORNE"" -> but E is excluded, so we cannot use E.

 How about ""HORNS""? -> H, O, R, N, S -> but the R is at position 3, not 2. We need R at position 2.

 So let's stick with words that have R at position 2 and N at position 4.

 I'll go with ""DRINK"".

 So the second guess: ""drink""

 But note: we must make sure that the word is valid. ""drink"" is a valid 5-letter word.

 Therefore, we guess ""drink"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- R (position 2) and N (position 4) are correct and in the right spots.
- C, A, and E are absent from the secret word.

The secret word follows the pattern: _ R _ N _

For the second guess, I chose ""drink"" because:
- It maintains R in position 2 and N in position 4.
- It tests new common letters (D, I, K) not previously used.
- It avoids excluded letters (C, A, E).

<guess>drink</guess>",drink,"We are given feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(✓), E(x)

We should try to use a word that:\n   - Has R in the second position and N in the fourth position.\n   - Does not use the letters C, A, E (since they are not in the word).\n   - Uses other common letters to try to uncover more of the word.\n\n Let\'s think of possible letters for the other positions.\n\n We have to avoid: C, A, E (and also note that we already know R and N are in the word, so we don\'t need to test them again in the same positions, but we might test for other letters).\n\n The word structure: [1] R [3] N [5]\n\n We can try to use a word that has the same R and N in positions 2 and 4, and uses new letters for positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\n Since we have two correct letters already, we can focus on finding the remaining three.\n\n Let\'s list some common consonants and vowels that we haven\'t tried. We haven\'t used: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n But note: we must avoid A, C, E.\n\n We also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s try to think of words that fit the pattern _ R _ N _\n\n Some examples:\n   - ""IRONY"" -> I, R, O, N, Y -> but we don\'t know if I, O, Y are in the word.\n   - ""URBAN"" -> U, R, B, A, N -> but A is already excluded, so invalid.\n   - ""GROIN"" -> G, R, O, I, N -> this fits: G at position 1, R at 2, O at 3, I at 4? Wait, no: position 4 must be N, so the fourth letter is N, so we need the third letter to be O and the fifth to be something? Actually, ""GROIN"" has N at position 5, not 4. So it doesn\'t fit the pattern.\n\n We need the fourth letter to be N. So the word must be: [1] R [3] N [5]\n\n Let me think of words that have R in the second position and N in the fourth:\n   - ""CRANE"" was already tried and we know C and A are not in the word, and E is not.\n   - ""DRINK"": D, R, I, N, K -> positions: D(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> this fits the pattern.\n   - ""GRIND"": G, R, I, N, D -> G(1), R(2), I(3), N(4), D(5) -> fits.\n   - ""TRUNK"": T, R, U, N, K -> T(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), K(5) -> fits.\n\n But note: we must avoid the letters C, A, E. So all these words (DRINK, GRIND, TRUNK) are acceptable because they don\'t contain C, A, or E.\n\n We can choose one of these. Let\'s pick ""DRINK"" because it uses common letters.\n\n However, we also want to test as many new letters as possible. In ""DRINK"", we are testing D, I, K (and we already know R and N are in the word and in the correct positions). So we are testing three new letters: D, I, K.\n\n Alternatively, we could choose a word that has a vowel we haven\'t tried (like O, U, I) and some consonants.\n\n Since we have two correct letters, we can also try to get information about the other positions.\n\n Let me see: the word ""PRONG"" -> P, R, O, N, G -> but the fifth letter is G, and we have O at position 3. This is a valid word? Actually, ""PRONG"" is a word.\n\n But note: we are avoiding A, C, E. So ""PRONG"" is acceptable.\n\n However, we have to consider that we are only on the second guess, so we can choose a word that might help us narrow down more possibilities.\n\n I think ""DRINK"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and we can see if D, I, or K are in the word.\n\n Alternatively, we could use ""TREND"" but note: the fourth letter must be N, and in ""TREND"" the fourth letter is D, not N. So that doesn\'t fit.\n\n Another option: ""BORNE"" -> but E is excluded, so we cannot use E.\n\n How about ""HORNS""? -> H, O, R, N, S -> but the R is at position 3, not 2. We need R at position 2.\n\n So let\'s stick with words that have R at position 2 and N at position 4.\n\n I\'ll go with ""DRINK"".\n\n So the second guess: ""drink""\n\n But note: we must make sure that the word is valid. ""drink"" is a valid 5-letter word.\n\n Therefore, we guess ""drink"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- R (position 2) and N (position 4) are correct and in the right spots.\n- C, A, and E are absent from the secret word.\n\nThe secret word follows the pattern: _ R _ N _\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""drink"" because:\n- It maintains R in position 2 and N in position 4.\n- It tests new common letters (D, I, K) not previously used.\n- It avoids excluded letters (C, A, E).\n\n<guess>drink</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(✓) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: drink -> FEEDBACK: D(✓) R(✓) I(x) N(✓) K(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(✓), A(x), N(✓), E(x)
Meaning:
  - R is correct and in position 2.
  - N is correct and in position 4.
  - C, A, E are not in the word.

Guess 2: ""drink"" -> D(✓), R(✓), I(x), N(✓), K(✓)
Meaning:
  - D is correct and in position 1.
  - R is correct and in position 2 (we already knew this).
  - I is not in the word.
  - N is correct and in position 4 (we already knew this).
  - K is correct and in position 5.

So, putting it all together:
  Position 1: D (correct)
  Position 2: R (correct)
  Position 3: ? (unknown, but we know it's not I, and also not C, A, E from the first guess)
  Position 4: N (correct)
  Position 5: K (correct)

Therefore, the secret word is: D R _ N K

We only need to find the third letter.

What can the third letter be?
- It cannot be C, A, E (from first guess) or I (from second guess).
- It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""DR"" in the first two, ""NK"" at the end.

We know the word is ""DR"" + [letter] + ""NK"".

Let's think of possible letters for the third position that make a valid 5-letter word.

Possible words:
- DRANK: But A is excluded (from first guess: A is not in the word), so not possible.
- DRINK: We already tried, and I is excluded.
- DRUNK: U is a vowel we haven't tested. But note, we haven't ruled out U.
- DROWNK? -> Not a word.
- DROPK? -> Not a word.
- DRINK is out.

Other possibilities:
- ""DRUNK"": D, R, U, N, K -> positions: D(1), R(2), U(3), N(4), K(5). This is a valid word.

Are there others?
- ""DRAIN"": But A is excluded and also the last letter is N? No, ""DRAIN"" is D,R,A,I,N -> but A and I are excluded, and also the pattern requires the fourth letter to be N and fifth to be K, so it doesn't fit.
- ""DREAM"": E is excluded and doesn't end with NK.
- ""DRYNK""? Not a word.

Another one: ""DROWN"" -> but that's 5 letters? D,R,O,W,N -> but then the fifth letter is N, but we need the fifth to be K and the fourth to be N. So ""DROWN"" is D,R,O,W,N -> positions: 4 is W? No, actually: 
  D(1), R(2), O(3), W(4), N(5) -> but we need position 4 to be N and 5 to be K. So it doesn't fit.

What about ""DRANK""? Again, A is excluded.

Another possibility: ""DRINK"" we tried, ""DRUNK"" is one.

Is there ""DRONK""? Not a word.

Or ""DREK""? Not a word.

What about ""DRINK"" and ""DRUNK"" are the main ones? But ""DRINK"" we tried and I is not in the word.

So the only common word that fits the pattern and the constraints is ""DRUNK"".

But let me double-check: 
- The word must be D R ? N K, and the third letter must be a vowel or consonant that forms a word.

We have:
- DRUNK: U is the third letter.

Are there any other words?
- ""DROUK"" is not a word.
- ""DREK"" is not a word.
- ""DRACK"" -> but A is excluded and also the pattern: D R A C K -> but we need the fourth letter to be N, not C. So no.

Therefore, the only common word that fits is ""DRUNK"".

But note: we haven't used U before, and it hasn't been excluded. So it's a candidate.

So the secret word must be ""DRUNK"".

We can guess ""DRUNK"" as the third guess.

But let's confirm the feedback we would get if the word is ""DRUNK"" for our guess ""drink"":
- We guessed ""drink"": D(✓) R(✓) I(x) N(✓) K(✓) -> which matches the feedback.

And for ""drunk"":
- D is at position 1: correct.
- R at position 2: correct.
- U at position 3: we are about to test.
- N at position 4: correct.
- K at position 5: correct.

So if we guess ""DRUNK"", we expect:
  D(✓), R(✓), U(✓), N(✓), K(✓)

Therefore, we can confidently guess ""DRUNK"".

But note: we are only on the third guess, and we have three more tries, but if we are sure, we can solve it.

Is there any other word that fits? Let me think again.

What about ""DROWN""? But that ends with N, not K, and the fourth letter would be W, not N? Actually, in ""DROWN"", the fourth letter is W and fifth is N, so it doesn't fit the pattern of having N at position 4 and K at position 5.

Another word: ""DRAKE""? But A is excluded and E is excluded, and also the pattern: we need N at position 4, but ""DRAKE"" has A at 3 and K at 4? D(1), R(2), A(3), K(4), E(5) -> doesn't fit.

""DRINK"" is out because of I.

""DRANK"" is out because of A.

""DRONE"": D(1), R(2), O(3), N(4), E(5) -> but E is excluded, and also the fifth letter must be K, not E.

""DRUSE"": D(1), R(2), U(3), S(4), E(5) -> E is excluded, and we need N at 4 and K at 5.

So no.

""DRUMS"": D(1), R(2), U(3), M(4), S(5) -> but we need N at 4 and K at 5.

Therefore, ""DRUNK"" is the only common word that fits.

So we'll guess ""DRUNK"".

Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:
- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: R (position 2) and N (position 4) are correct and in the right spots. C, A, and E are absent from the secret word.
- **Guess 2 (""drink"")**: D (position 1), R (position 2), N (position 4), and K (position 5) are correct and in the right spots. I is absent.

This reveals the secret word pattern: **D R _ N K** (with only the 3rd letter missing).

Constraints for the 3rd letter:
- It cannot be C, A, E (from Guess 1) or I (from Guess 2).
- It must form a valid English word with ""DR"" at the start and ""NK"" at the end.

After evaluating possible words:
- ""DRANK"" is invalid (A is excluded).
- ""DRINK"" is invalid (I is excluded and already tested).
- ""DRONE"" is invalid (E is excluded and doesn't end with ""K"").
- ""DRAIN"" is invalid (A and I are excluded).
- **""DRUNK""** is valid and fits all constraints (U is a new, untested letter that completes the word).

Thus, the secret word must be **DRUNK**. This guess will confirm all positions.
