We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let's choose one that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). Also, it doesn't repeat any letters.

We are given feedback from the first guess:
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: x -> not in the word
- A: x -> not in the word
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, since positions are 1-indexed? Actually, in the example they showed the positions as given. But note: in ""crane"", the fourth letter is N, so N is in the secret word at position 4.

Since the feedback was for ""crane"": 
  C (x) -> not present
  R (x) -> not present
  A (x) -> not present
  N (✓) -> present and at position 4
  E (x) -> not present

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have letter 'N' at position 4.
- Must NOT contain the letters C, R, A, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should pick a word that:
1. Has 'N' in the fourth position (since it's fixed per the feedback).
2. Does not contain the letters C, R, A, E (as they are not in the word).
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Possible words with 'N' at position 4? Let's think of 5-letter words ending with ...N? Actually position 4 is the fourth letter. So the pattern is: ? ? ? N ?

Since the word must have an 'N' at position 4, and must avoid C, R, A, E.

We can consider words like:
- WINDY, but let's check: W I N D Y -> N at pos 3? Wait, no: positions in a 5-letter word: 
  Position 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

In ""windy"": 
  Pos1: W, Pos2: I, Pos3: N, Pos4: D, Pos5: Y -> doesn't have N at 4.

We need words where the fourth letter is N. Examples:
- ""BLANK"": letters B, L, A, N, K -> but A is already excluded (feedback said A not in word), so cannot use A.
- ""CLINK"": has C -> excluded.
- ""SKUNK"": but has K at position 5? And U? Also, we don't know about K yet. But S? We don't know. But we cannot use C,R,A,E. So S is allowed? Let's list words.

Actually, common words with N at position 4:
- ""POINT"": P O I N T -> has I and O? But we don't know about O or I or T.
- ""JOINT"": J O I N T -> similar.
- ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> O and U? 
- ""DAUNT"": D A U N T -> but A is excluded (we know A is not in the word).
- ""COUNT"": C O U N T -> has C -> excluded.

We must avoid A, C, E, R.

Other possibilities:
- ""BOUND"": B O U N D -> no A,C,E,R? But O and U are unknown. Also, D at the end.
- ""FOUND"": F O U N D -> same, but F?
- ""POUND"": same.
- ""WOUND"": W O U N D -> same.

But note: we haven't used the fact that we can test other common letters.

Also, words without the forbidden letters: so we can use B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (except A, C, E, R).

We want to maximize information. So we should use letters that are frequently used, and avoid repeating letters we already know are absent.

Another word: ""SHOWN"": S H O W N -> positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4)? Wait, in ""shown"", the fourth letter is W? Then fifth is N? No, ""SHOWN"" has 5 letters: S-H-O-W-N? Actually, no: it's S-H-O-W-N? Wait, let me check.

Actually, ""SHOWN"" is S-H-O-W-N? That would be S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). We need N at position 4? Here N is at position 5. So incorrect.

We need a word with the fourth letter as N. So the word pattern: _ _ _ N _

Let me try to think of words: 
- ""BLUNT"": B L U N T -> fourth letter is N. And letters: B,L,U,T -> none of A,C,E,R? Yes. So it's a candidate.
- ""GRUNT"": G R U N T -> but R is excluded? R is not allowed because feedback said R(x) -> not in the word. So no R.
- ""STUNG"": S T U N G -> positions: S(1),T(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) -> has N at position 4. Letters: S,T,U,G -> none forbidden.

So ""STUNG"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""SWUNG"": S W U N G -> same, but with W.

Also, ""DOING"": D O I N G -> position: D(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> that fits. Letters: D,O,I,G -> none forbidden.

But note: in ""DOING"", the word has 'O','I','G', and we don't know about them.

Another: ""GOING"": G O I N G -> same as above, but starts with G.

We should choose a word that has as many new letters as possible and avoids the known absent ones.

My goal is to cover common vowels and consonants. We haven't tested: O, I, U, and consonants like S, T, L, D, etc.

I am considering ""STUNG"": 
- It has S, T, U, N, G -> N is fixed at position 4. We avoid forbidden letters.

But note: ""STUNG"" has the letter U, which is a vowel, and S,T,G are common.

Alternatively, ""BLIND"": but position? B L I N D -> N is at position 4? B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). Okay. But we cannot use BLIND? Because it has I? But we don't know. And letters: B, L, I, N, D -> none forbidden.

However, we already know N is at position 4, so we can fix that.

But wait, in ""BLIND"", the word has 'I' and 'D'. We have to see which gives more coverage.

I could also consider ""POINT"" but it has O and I? But note: ""POINT"" is P O I N T -> N at position 4? P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.

But we don't know about O, I, P, T.

We want to avoid previously excluded letters? Only A,C,E,R are excluded.

So POINT is valid? Letters: P, O, I, N, T -> no A,C,E,R.

Similarly, JOINT, but J is less common.

Another word: ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> letters M, O, U, N, T -> no forbidden.

But U is in there.

I think either ""POINT"", ""STUNG"", or ""BLUNT"" would be good.

But note: we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4). We need to test other positions.

I am leaning toward ""POINT"" because it has common letters: P, O, I, T.

Alternatively, ""STUNG"" has S,T,U,N,G.

But since N is fixed at 4, in ""POINT"" we have:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N (known)
- Position 5: T

That gives us information about positions 1,2,3,5.

Similarly, ""STUNG"": 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G

We haven't tested S, T, U, G.

But ""POINT"" includes the vowels O and I, which might be more informative.

I recall that in Wordle strategy, we often want to cover vowels. In our first guess ""crane"", we tested A and E, both excluded. So the word must have other vowels: I,O,U or sometimes Y.

Therefore, testing O and I in ""POINT"" might be good.

But note: we don't know if the word has O or I. It could have U or something.

But for maximizing information, let's go with ""POINT"".

Another idea: since we know N at position 4, and we know the word doesn't have A,C,E,R, we might choose a word that uses the letter S? S is very common.

But ""POINT"" has no S.

Alternatively, we could do ""STINT"": S T I N T -> but then T is at positions 2 and 5? That would be S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But T at position 2 and 5? That's using T twice. Not good because we are wasting a slot on a repeated letter.

Better to use distinct letters.

So, ""POINT"" has distinct letters: P,O,I,N,T -> that's good.

Similarly, ""STUNG"" has distinct: S,T,U,N,G -> distinct.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.

But let's make sure: can we use ""POINT""? Yes.

So I'll go with ""POINT"".

Therefore, the second guess is ""POINT"".

Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where:
- C, R, A, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"")
- N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, marked with ""✓"")

The secret word:
- Must have ""N"" as the 4th letter
- Must not contain C, R, A, or E

For the second guess, I chose ""POINT"" because:
- It places ""N"" in the 4th position as required
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)
- It introduces new, common letters: P, O, I, T
- These letters cover vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T) to maximize information

We need to make a second guess. We should pick a word that:
1. Has 'N' in the fourth position (since it's fixed per the feedback).
2. Does not contain the letters C, R, A, E (as they are not in the word).
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Possible words with 'N' at position 4? Let's think of 5-letter words ending with ...N? Actually position 4 is the fourth letter. So the pattern is: ? ? ? N ?

Since the word must have an 'N' at position 4, and must avoid C, R, A, E.

We can consider words like:
- WINDY, but let's check: W I N D Y -> N at pos 3? Wait, no: positions in a 5-letter word: 
  Position 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

In ""windy"": 
  Pos1: W, Pos2: I, Pos3: N, Pos4: D, Pos5: Y -> doesn't have N at 4.

We need words where the fourth letter is N. Examples:
- ""BLANK"": letters B, L, A, N, K -> but A is already excluded (feedback said A not in word), so cannot use A.
- ""CLINK"": has C -> excluded.
- ""SKUNK"": but has K at position 5? And U? Also, we don't know about K yet. But S? We don't know. But we cannot use C,R,A,E. So S is allowed? Let's list words.

Actually, common words with N at position 4:
- ""POINT"": P O I N T -> has I and O? But we don't know about O or I or T.
- ""JOINT"": J O I N T -> similar.
- ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> O and U? 
- ""DAUNT"": D A U N T -> but A is excluded (we know A is not in the word).
- ""COUNT"": C O U N T -> has C -> excluded.

We must avoid A, C, E, R.

Other possibilities:
- ""BOUND"": B O U N D -> no A,C,E,R? But O and U are unknown. Also, D at the end.
- ""FOUND"": F O U N D -> same, but F?
- ""POUND"": same.
- ""WOUND"": W O U N D -> same.

But note: we haven't used the fact that we can test other common letters.

Also, words without the forbidden letters: so we can use B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (except A, C, E, R).

We want to maximize information. So we should use letters that are frequently used, and avoid repeating letters we already know are absent.

Another word: ""SHOWN"": S H O W N -> positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4)? Wait, in ""shown"", the fourth letter is W? Then fifth is N? No, ""SHOWN"" has 5 letters: S-H-O-W-N? Actually, no: it's S-H-O-W-N? Wait, let me check.

Actually, ""SHOWN"" is S-H-O-W-N? That would be S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). We need N at position 4? Here N is at position 5. So incorrect.

We need a word with the fourth letter as N. So the word pattern: _ _ _ N _

Let me try to think of words: 
- ""BLUNT"": B L U N T -> fourth letter is N. And letters: B,L,U,T -> none of A,C,E,R? Yes. So it's a candidate.
- ""GRUNT"": G R U N T -> but R is excluded? R is not allowed because feedback said R(x) -> not in the word. So no R.
- ""STUNG"": S T U N G -> positions: S(1),T(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) -> has N at position 4. Letters: S,T,U,G -> none forbidden.

So ""STUNG"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""SWUNG"": S W U N G -> same, but with W.

Also, ""DOING"": D O I N G -> position: D(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> that fits. Letters: D,O,I,G -> none forbidden.

But note: in ""DOING"", the word has 'O','I','G', and we don't know about them.

Another: ""GOING"": G O I N G -> same as above, but starts with G.

We should choose a word that has as many new letters as possible and avoids the known absent ones.

My goal is to cover common vowels and consonants. We haven't tested: O, I, U, and consonants like S, T, L, D, etc.

I am considering ""STUNG"": 
- It has S, T, U, N, G -> N is fixed at position 4. We avoid forbidden letters.

But note: ""STUNG"" has the letter U, which is a vowel, and S,T,G are common.

Alternatively, ""BLIND"": but position? B L I N D -> N is at position 4? B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). Okay. But we cannot use BLIND? Because it has I? But we don't know. And letters: B, L, I, N, D -> none forbidden.

However, we already know N is at position 4, so we can fix that.

But wait, in ""BLIND"", the word has 'I' and 'D'. We have to see which gives more coverage.

I could also consider ""POINT"" but it has O and I? But note: ""POINT"" is P O I N T -> N at position 4? P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.

But we don't know about O, I, P, T.

We want to avoid previously excluded letters? Only A,C,E,R are excluded.

So POINT is valid? Letters: P, O, I, N, T -> no A,C,E,R.

Similarly, JOINT, but J is less common.

Another word: ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> letters M, O, U, N, T -> no forbidden.

But U is in there.

I think either ""POINT"", ""STUNG"", or ""BLUNT"" would be good.

But note: we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4). We need to test other positions.

I am leaning toward ""POINT"" because it has common letters: P, O, I, T.

Alternatively, ""STUNG"" has S,T,U,N,G.

But since N is fixed at 4, in ""POINT"" we have:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N (known)
- Position 5: T

That gives us information about positions 1,2,3,5.

Similarly, ""STUNG"": 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G

We haven't tested S, T, U, G.

But ""POINT"" includes the vowels O and I, which might be more informative.

I recall that in Wordle strategy, we often want to cover vowels. In our first guess ""crane"", we tested A and E, both excluded. So the word must have other vowels: I,O,U or sometimes Y.

Therefore, testing O and I in ""POINT"" might be good.

But note: we don't know if the word has O or I. It could have U or something.

But for maximizing information, let's go with ""POINT"".

Another idea: since we know N at position 4, and we know the word doesn't have A,C,E,R, we might choose a word that uses the letter S? S is very common.

But ""POINT"" has no S.

Alternatively, we could do ""STINT"": S T I N T -> but then T is at positions 2 and 5? That would be S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But T at position 2 and 5? That's using T twice. Not good because we are wasting a slot on a repeated letter.

Better to use distinct letters.

So, ""POINT"" has distinct letters: P,O,I,N,T -> that's good.

Similarly, ""STUNG"" has distinct: S,T,U,N,G -> distinct.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.

But let's make sure: can we use ""POINT""? Yes.

So I'll go with ""POINT"".

Therefore, the second guess is ""POINT"".

Format: <guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where:
- C, R, A, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"")
- N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, marked with ""✓"")

The secret word:
- Must have ""N"" as the 4th letter
- Must not contain C, R, A, or E

For the second guess, I chose ""POINT"" because:
- It places ""N"" in the 4th position as required
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)
- It introduces new, common letters: P, O, I, T
- These letters cover vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T) to maximize information
- All letters are distinct to test more possibilities

We are given feedback from the second guess ""point"":
- P: x -> not in the word
- O: x -> not in the word
- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, since in ""point"", I is the third letter)
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, as before)
- T: x -> not in the word

So now we know:
- The secret word has ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, T (from both guesses).

Additionally, we know the word must be of the form: _ _ I N _

We need to avoid the letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use I and N, but they are already placed).

We must form a 5-letter word with the pattern _ _ I N _.

We should choose a word that uses common letters from the available set to maximize information.

Common letters to consider: S, U, L, D, M, H, G, B, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and use only the available letters.

Possible words:
- ""BLINK"": B L I N K -> but we have B, L, I, N, K. However, we don't know about B, L, K. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters? B, L, K are allowed. But wait, ""BLINK"" has I at position 3 and N at 4? 
  Positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> yes, matches.
  But we have to check if any letter is forbidden: B, L, K are not in the forbidden list (A,C,E,O,P,R,T). So it's allowed.

- ""CLINK"": but C is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""FLING"": F L I N G -> F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: F, L, G -> allowed? F, L, G are not forbidden. So yes.

- ""SLING"": S L I N G -> S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, L, G are allowed.

- ""STING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""SWING"": S W I N G -> S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, W, G allowed.

- ""BRING"": B R I N G -> but R is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""THING"": T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> D(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). D, Y, G allowed.

- ""FLINT"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""BLIND"": B L I N D -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). B, L, D allowed.

- ""BLIMP"": but P is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""GLINT"": T forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""QUINT"": Q U I N T -> T forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""JUIN?"": not a word.

We have several candidates: ""BLINK"", ""FLING"", ""SLING"", ""SWING"", ""DYING"", ""BLIND"".

We want to choose one that uses letters we haven't tested yet and are common.

We haven't tested: S, B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

In ""BLINK"": tests B, L, K (and I and N are known).
In ""FLING"": tests F, L, G.
In ""SLING"": tests S, L, G.
In ""SWING"": tests S, W, G.
In ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G.
In ""BLIND"": tests B, L, D.

We know I and N are fixed, so we are only testing the first, second, and fifth letters.

We should avoid using letters that might be less common? But we need to cover as many possibilities.

Note: We have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

I think ""SLING"" is a good candidate because S and L are very common letters.

Alternatively, ""SWING"" has W, which is less common, so maybe not.

""BLINK"" has K, which is also common.

But let's see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

We can also consider ""SHINY"": but position? S H I N Y -> I is at position 3? S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes. And letters: S, H, Y -> allowed? H and Y are not forbidden. So ""SHINY"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""WHINY"": W H I N Y -> same, W and H.

But we don't know about H.

Another: ""SKIN?"": but we need 5 letters. ""SKINS"" is 5 letters but ends with S? Pattern is _ _ I N _, so fifth letter must be something. ""SKINS"" is S K I N S -> but that has I at position 3? S(1), K(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But S is repeated? And we don't know if S is in the word. But it's allowed? The word must have the pattern, and S is at position 1 and 5. But we are testing, so it's okay? However, repeating S might not be efficient because if S is in the word, we might not know where. But since we are testing position 1 and 5, it could be useful? Actually, if S is in the word, we get feedback for both positions. But it's not ideal for information.

So better to avoid repeats.

Therefore, ""SKINS"" is not great because of the repeated S.

Stick with distinct letters.

Another word: ""BUILD"": but I is at position 3? B U I L D -> B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> but we need N at position 4, not L. So no.

We must have I at 3 and N at 4.

So the word must be: ? ? I N ?

I think ""SLING"" is a good choice: common letters S, L, G.

""FLING"" is also good: F, L, G.

But F is less common than S? S is more common.

Similarly, ""BLIND"" has B, L, D.

I think S is the most common consonant, so let's go with a word that has S.

""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> I and N known, so testing S, L, G.

We can also consider ""SHINS"": but repeated S? S H I N S -> repeated S and we don't know if S is in the word. Not ideal.

""SHINE"": but E is forbidden -> not allowed.

""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> distinct letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N known, so testing S, H, Y.

H and Y are less common? But we have to test them.

I think ""SLING"" is better because L is more common than H.

Another candidate: ""SMITH"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

""SPRIG"": P and R forbidden -> not allowed.

""SWING"": S W I N G -> testing S, W, G. W is less common.

""BLINK"": B L I N K -> testing B, L, K. B and K are common.

But S is more common than B? In English, S is the most common letter at the end, but we are at the beginning.

Since we are testing the first, second, and fifth letters, we should cover common letters for those positions.

For position 1: common letters: S, B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, etc.
For position 2: vowels or common consonants? But we don't have many vowels left: we have U and Y (and sometimes W, Y as vowels). We already know A, E, I, O are not in the word? We know A, E, O are not in the word, but I is in the word at position 3. So the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, because it could have U or Y.

But in 5-letter words, there is usually at least two vowels? Not always, but often.

We have I as one vowel. It might have U or Y.

In ""SLING"": the vowels are I only? L, G are consonants. So it has only one vowel? But that's possible, e.g., ""lynch"", but we have I.

Similarly, ""BLINK"" has I and that's it? B, L, I, N, K -> only I as vowel? But that might be acceptable.

But let's check: ""lynch"" has Y as vowel. In ""BLINK"", I is the only vowel, which is acceptable.

But we might want to test a vowel? We have U and Y available.

In ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> Y is a vowel? So it has two vowels: Y and I. That might be good because we can check if Y is in the word.

Similarly, ""SHINY"" has I and Y.

So ""DYING"" or ""SHINY"" might be better to test a vowel.

But we don't know if the word has a vowel at position 2 or 5? It could.

Given that we have only one vowel (I) so far, and the word might have another vowel (U or Y), it would be good to test one of them.

So let's consider ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G. Y is a vowel.

""SHINY"": tests S, H, Y. Also Y.

""JUINY"" not a word.

""BUYIN"" not a word.

""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: L, Y, G -> allowed. And it has Y as a vowel.

So ""LYING"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""TYING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

So we have ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""SHINY"".

Now, among these, which one to choose?

""DYING"": D, Y, G
""LYING"": L, Y, G
""SHINY"": S, H, Y

We want to test common letters. S is more common than D or L? S is very common.

But H is less common.

Also, we are testing Y in all.

I think ""SHINY"" is good because it tests S and H, and Y.

But ""LYING"" tests L and Y, G.

G is common.

But S is the most common, so let's go with ""SHINY"" to test S and H.

Alternatively, we can choose ""SLING"" to test S and L, but without a vowel.

But we have to consider that the word might not have Y, so testing Y might not be necessary.

But we don't know, so it's better to test a vowel if possible.

Since we are at the third guess, and we have three positions to test (1,2,5), we can test one vowel and two consonants.

In ""SHINY"", we test S (consonant), H (consonant), Y (vowel). That's a good mix.

In ""LYING"", we test L (consonant), Y (vowel), G (consonant). Also good.

But S is more common than L, so ""SHINY"" might be better? But H is less common than G? H is more common than G? Let me think.

In English, the frequency of letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... So S is 7th, H is 8th, L is 11th, G is 16th, Y is 20th, etc.

So S and H are both in the top 10.

In ""SHINY"", we test S and H, which are high frequency, and Y which is less common but a vowel.

In ""LYING"", we test L (11th), Y (20th), G (16th) — lower frequency.

So ""SHINY"" seems better for covering common letters.

Also, ""SHINY"" is a common word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SHINY"".

But let's confirm the pattern: S H I N Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I (correct), 4:N (correct), 5:Y.

And letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N are known, so we are testing S, H, Y.

And no forbidden letters.

So guess: ""SHINY""

But note: we have to make sure that Y is allowed at the end. Yes, it is.

So I think that's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could choose ""SLING"" to avoid the less common Y? But then we don't test a vowel.

But let's see: if we guess ""SLING"", and it turns out the word has Y, we might not find it.

But we have to make a choice.

I think testing a vowel is important, so ""SHINY"" is better.

Another candidate: ""SWING"" has W, which is less common than H? W is 15th, H is 8th, so H is better.

So I'll go with ""SHINY"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - **C, R, A, E** are not in the word.  
- **Guess 2: ""point""** → Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - **N** is confirmed again at position 4.  
  - **P, O, T** are not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I N _` (positions: 1, 2, 3=I, 4=N, 5).  
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **A, C, E, O, P, R, T**.  
- Available letters (not yet tested or confirmed): **B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
- Since the word must contain at least one vowel (besides I), and **A, E, O** are excluded, the remaining vowel possibilities are **U** or **Y** (or rarely, **W** as part of a diphthong).  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- **Goal:** Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, L, D) and the vowel **Y** (to cover vowel possibilities).  
- **Pattern constraint:** Must be `_ _ I N _`.  
- **Avoid:** Repeating excluded letters or known letters unnecessarily.  
- **Ideal word:** Uses distinct, untested letters to maximize information.  

### Why ""shiny""?
- **Fits the pattern:** `S H I N Y` → Positions 3 and 4 are fixed as **I** and **N**.  
- **Tests key letters:**  
  - **S** (high-frequency consonant, position 1).  
  - **H** (common consonant, position 2).  
  - **Y** (vowel candidate, position 5; tests if the word has a second vowel).  
- **Avoids excluded letters:** No A, C, E, O, P, R, T.  
- **Distinct letters:** All letters are unique, testing three new positions (1, 2, 5) efficiently.  
- **Common word:** ""Shiny"" is a valid English word, reducing the risk of invalid guesses.  

If ""shiny"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal:  
- Whether **S** is in the word (and if so, its position).  
- Whether **H** is in the word (and if so, its position).  
- Whether **Y** is in the word (and if so, its position).  

This will significantly narrow down possibilities for the next guess.  

<guess>shiny</guess>",shiny,"We are given feedback from the second guess ""point"":
- P: x -> not in the word
- O: x -> not in the word
- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, since in ""point"", I is the third letter)
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, as before)
- T: x -> not in the word

So now we know:
- The secret word has ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, T (from both guesses).

Additionally, we know the word must be of the form: _ _ I N _

We need to avoid the letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use I and N, but they are already placed).

We must form a 5-letter word with the pattern _ _ I N _.

We should choose a word that uses common letters from the available set to maximize information.

Common letters to consider: S, U, L, D, M, H, G, B, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and use only the available letters.

Possible words:
- ""BLINK"": B L I N K -> but we have B, L, I, N, K. However, we don't know about B, L, K. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters? B, L, K are allowed. But wait, ""BLINK"" has I at position 3 and N at 4? 
  Positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> yes, matches.
  But we have to check if any letter is forbidden: B, L, K are not in the forbidden list (A,C,E,O,P,R,T). So it's allowed.

- ""CLINK"": but C is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""FLING"": F L I N G -> F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: F, L, G -> allowed? F, L, G are not forbidden. So yes.

- ""SLING"": S L I N G -> S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, L, G are allowed.

- ""STING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""SWING"": S W I N G -> S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, W, G allowed.

- ""BRING"": B R I N G -> but R is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""THING"": T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> D(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). D, Y, G allowed.

- ""FLINT"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""BLIND"": B L I N D -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). B, L, D allowed.

- ""BLIMP"": but P is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""GLINT"": T forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""QUINT"": Q U I N T -> T forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""JUIN?"": not a word.

We have several candidates: ""BLINK"", ""FLING"", ""SLING"", ""SWING"", ""DYING"", ""BLIND"".

We want to choose one that uses letters we haven't tested yet and are common.

We haven't tested: S, B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

In ""BLINK"": tests B, L, K (and I and N are known).
In ""FLING"": tests F, L, G.
In ""SLING"": tests S, L, G.
In ""SWING"": tests S, W, G.
In ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G.
In ""BLIND"": tests B, L, D.

We know I and N are fixed, so we are only testing the first, second, and fifth letters.

We should avoid using letters that might be less common? But we need to cover as many possibilities.

Note: We have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

I think ""SLING"" is a good candidate because S and L are very common letters.

Alternatively, ""SWING"" has W, which is less common, so maybe not.

""BLINK"" has K, which is also common.

But let's see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

We can also consider ""SHINY"": but position? S H I N Y -> I is at position 3? S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes. And letters: S, H, Y -> allowed? H and Y are not forbidden. So ""SHINY"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""WHINY"": W H I N Y -> same, W and H.

But we don't know about H.

Another: ""SKIN?"": but we need 5 letters. ""SKINS"" is 5 letters but ends with S? Pattern is _ _ I N _, so fifth letter must be something. ""SKINS"" is S K I N S -> but that has I at position 3? S(1), K(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But S is repeated? And we don't know if S is in the word. But it's allowed? The word must have the pattern, and S is at position 1 and 5. But we are testing, so it's okay? However, repeating S might not be efficient because if S is in the word, we might not know where. But since we are testing position 1 and 5, it could be useful? Actually, if S is in the word, we get feedback for both positions. But it's not ideal for information.

So better to avoid repeats.

Therefore, ""SKINS"" is not great because of the repeated S.

Stick with distinct letters.

Another word: ""BUILD"": but I is at position 3? B U I L D -> B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> but we need N at position 4, not L. So no.

We must have I at 3 and N at 4.

So the word must be: ? ? I N ?

I think ""SLING"" is a good choice: common letters S, L, G.

""FLING"" is also good: F, L, G.

But F is less common than S? S is more common.

Similarly, ""BLIND"" has B, L, D.

I think S is the most common consonant, so let's go with a word that has S.

""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> I and N known, so testing S, L, G.

We can also consider ""SHINS"": but repeated S? S H I N S -> repeated S and we don't know if S is in the word. Not ideal.

""SHINE"": but E is forbidden -> not allowed.

""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> distinct letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N known, so testing S, H, Y.

H and Y are less common? But we have to test them.

I think ""SLING"" is better because L is more common than H.

Another candidate: ""SMITH"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

""SPRIG"": P and R forbidden -> not allowed.

""SWING"": S W I N G -> testing S, W, G. W is less common.

""BLINK"": B L I N K -> testing B, L, K. B and K are common.

But S is more common than B? In English, S is the most common letter at the end, but we are at the beginning.

Since we are testing the first, second, and fifth letters, we should cover common letters for those positions.

For position 1: common letters: S, B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, etc.
For position 2: vowels or common consonants? But we don't have many vowels left: we have U and Y (and sometimes W, Y as vowels). We already know A, E, I, O are not in the word? We know A, E, O are not in the word, but I is in the word at position 3. So the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, because it could have U or Y.

But in 5-letter words, there is usually at least two vowels? Not always, but often.

We have I as one vowel. It might have U or Y.

In ""SLING"": the vowels are I only? L, G are consonants. So it has only one vowel? But that's possible, e.g., ""lynch"", but we have I.

Similarly, ""BLINK"" has I and that's it? B, L, I, N, K -> only I as vowel? But that might be acceptable.

But let's check: ""lynch"" has Y as vowel. In ""BLINK"", I is the only vowel, which is acceptable.

But we might want to test a vowel? We have U and Y available.

In ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> Y is a vowel? So it has two vowels: Y and I. That might be good because we can check if Y is in the word.

Similarly, ""SHINY"" has I and Y.

So ""DYING"" or ""SHINY"" might be better to test a vowel.

But we don't know if the word has a vowel at position 2 or 5? It could.

Given that we have only one vowel (I) so far, and the word might have another vowel (U or Y), it would be good to test one of them.

So let's consider ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G. Y is a vowel.

""SHINY"": tests S, H, Y. Also Y.

""JUINY"" not a word.

""BUYIN"" not a word.

""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: L, Y, G -> allowed. And it has Y as a vowel.

So ""LYING"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""TYING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

So we have ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""SHINY"".

Now, among these, which one to choose?

""DYING"": D, Y, G
""LYING"": L, Y, G
""SHINY"": S, H, Y

We want to test common letters. S is more common than D or L? S is very common.

But H is less common.

Also, we are testing Y in all.

I think ""SHINY"" is good because it tests S and H, and Y.

But ""LYING"" tests L and Y, G.

G is common.

But S is the most common, so let's go with ""SHINY"" to test S and H.

Alternatively, we can choose ""SLING"" to test S and L, but without a vowel.

But we have to consider that the word might not have Y, so testing Y might not be necessary.

But we don't know, so it's better to test a vowel if possible.

Since we are at the third guess, and we have three positions to test (1,2,5), we can test one vowel and two consonants.

In ""SHINY"", we test S (consonant), H (consonant), Y (vowel). That's a good mix.

In ""LYING"", we test L (consonant), Y (vowel), G (consonant). Also good.

But S is more common than L, so ""SHINY"" might be better? But H is less common than G? H is more common than G? Let me think.

In English, the frequency of letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... So S is 7th, H is 8th, L is 11th, G is 16th, Y is 20th, etc.

So S and H are both in the top 10.

In ""SHINY"", we test S and H, which are high frequency, and Y which is less common but a vowel.

In ""LYING"", we test L (11th), Y (20th), G (16th) — lower frequency.

So ""SHINY"" seems better for covering common letters.

Also, ""SHINY"" is a common word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SHINY"".

But let's confirm the pattern: S H I N Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I (correct), 4:N (correct), 5:Y.

And letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N are known, so we are testing S, H, Y.

And no forbidden letters.

So guess: ""SHINY""

But note: we have to make sure that Y is allowed at the end. Yes, it is.

So I think that's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could choose ""SLING"" to avoid the less common Y? But then we don't test a vowel.

But let's see: if we guess ""SLING"", and it turns out the word has Y, we might not find it.

But we have to make a choice.

I think testing a vowel is important, so ""SHINY"" is better.

Another candidate: ""SWING"" has W, which is less common than H? W is 15th, H is 8th, so H is better.

So I'll go with ""SHINY"".

 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let's choose one that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). Also, it doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess:
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: x -> not in the word
- A: x -> not in the word
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, since positions are 1-indexed? Actually, in the example they showed the positions as given. But note: in ""crane"", the fourth letter is N, so N is in the secret word at position 4.

Since the feedback was for ""crane"": 
  C (x) -> not present
  R (x) -> not present
  A (x) -> not present
  N (✓) -> present and at position 4
  E (x) -> not present

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have letter 'N' at position 4.
- Must NOT contain the letters C, R, A, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should pick a word that:
1. Has 'N' in the fourth position (since it's fixed per the feedback).
2. Does not contain the letters C, R, A, E (as they are not in the word).
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Possible words with 'N' at position 4? Let's think of 5-letter words ending with ...N? Actually position 4 is the fourth letter. So the pattern is: ? ? ? N ?

Since the word must have an 'N' at position 4, and must avoid C, R, A, E.

We can consider words like:
- WINDY, but let's check: W I N D Y -> N at pos 3? Wait, no: positions in a 5-letter word: 
  Position 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

In ""windy"": 
  Pos1: W, Pos2: I, Pos3: N, Pos4: D, Pos5: Y -> doesn't have N at 4.

We need words where the fourth letter is N. Examples:
- ""BLANK"": letters B, L, A, N, K -> but A is already excluded (feedback said A not in word), so cannot use A.
- ""CLINK"": has C -> excluded.
- ""SKUNK"": but has K at position 5? And U? Also, we don't know about K yet. But S? We don't know. But we cannot use C,R,A,E. So S is allowed? Let's list words.

Actually, common words with N at position 4:
- ""POINT"": P O I N T -> has I and O? But we don't know about O or I or T.
- ""JOINT"": J O I N T -> similar.
- ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> O and U? 
- ""DAUNT"": D A U N T -> but A is excluded (we know A is not in the word).
- ""COUNT"": C O U N T -> has C -> excluded.

We must avoid A, C, E, R.

Other possibilities:
- ""BOUND"": B O U N D -> no A,C,E,R? But O and U are unknown. Also, D at the end.
- ""FOUND"": F O U N D -> same, but F?
- ""POUND"": same.
- ""WOUND"": W O U N D -> same.

But note: we haven't used the fact that we can test other common letters.

Also, words without the forbidden letters: so we can use B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (except A, C, E, R).

We want to maximize information. So we should use letters that are frequently used, and avoid repeating letters we already know are absent.

Another word: ""SHOWN"": S H O W N -> positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4)? Wait, in ""shown"", the fourth letter is W? Then fifth is N? No, ""SHOWN"" has 5 letters: S-H-O-W-N? Actually, no: it's S-H-O-W-N? Wait, let me check.

Actually, ""SHOWN"" is S-H-O-W-N? That would be S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). We need N at position 4? Here N is at position 5. So incorrect.

We need a word with the fourth letter as N. So the word pattern: _ _ _ N _

Let me try to think of words: 
- ""BLUNT"": B L U N T -> fourth letter is N. And letters: B,L,U,T -> none of A,C,E,R? Yes. So it's a candidate.
- ""GRUNT"": G R U N T -> but R is excluded? R is not allowed because feedback said R(x) -> not in the word. So no R.
- ""STUNG"": S T U N G -> positions: S(1),T(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) -> has N at position 4. Letters: S,T,U,G -> none forbidden.

So ""STUNG"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""SWUNG"": S W U N G -> same, but with W.

Also, ""DOING"": D O I N G -> position: D(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> that fits. Letters: D,O,I,G -> none forbidden.

But note: in ""DOING"", the word has 'O','I','G', and we don't know about them.

Another: ""GOING"": G O I N G -> same as above, but starts with G.

We should choose a word that has as many new letters as possible and avoids the known absent ones.

My goal is to cover common vowels and consonants. We haven't tested: O, I, U, and consonants like S, T, L, D, etc.

I am considering ""STUNG"": 
- It has S, T, U, N, G -> N is fixed at position 4. We avoid forbidden letters.

But note: ""STUNG"" has the letter U, which is a vowel, and S,T,G are common.

Alternatively, ""BLIND"": but position? B L I N D -> N is at position 4? B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). Okay. But we cannot use BLIND? Because it has I? But we don't know. And letters: B, L, I, N, D -> none forbidden.

However, we already know N is at position 4, so we can fix that.

But wait, in ""BLIND"", the word has 'I' and 'D'. We have to see which gives more coverage.

I could also consider ""POINT"" but it has O and I? But note: ""POINT"" is P O I N T -> N at position 4? P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.

But we don't know about O, I, P, T.

We want to avoid previously excluded letters? Only A,C,E,R are excluded.

So POINT is valid? Letters: P, O, I, N, T -> no A,C,E,R.

Similarly, JOINT, but J is less common.

Another word: ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> letters M, O, U, N, T -> no forbidden.

But U is in there.

I think either ""POINT"", ""STUNG"", or ""BLUNT"" would be good.

But note: we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4). We need to test other positions.

I am leaning toward ""POINT"" because it has common letters: P, O, I, T.

Alternatively, ""STUNG"" has S,T,U,N,G.

But since N is fixed at 4, in ""POINT"" we have:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N (known)
- Position 5: T

That gives us information about positions 1,2,3,5.

Similarly, ""STUNG"": 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G

We haven't tested S, T, U, G.

But ""POINT"" includes the vowels O and I, which might be more informative.

I recall that in Wordle strategy, we often want to cover vowels. In our first guess ""crane"", we tested A and E, both excluded. So the word must have other vowels: I,O,U or sometimes Y.

Therefore, testing O and I in ""POINT"" might be good.

But note: we don't know if the word has O or I. It could have U or something.

But for maximizing information, let's go with ""POINT"".

Another idea: since we know N at position 4, and we know the word doesn't have A,C,E,R, we might choose a word that uses the letter S? S is very common.

But ""POINT"" has no S.

Alternatively, we could do ""STINT"": S T I N T -> but then T is at positions 2 and 5? That would be S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But T at position 2 and 5? That's using T twice. Not good because we are wasting a slot on a repeated letter.

Better to use distinct letters.

So, ""POINT"" has distinct letters: P,O,I,N,T -> that's good.

Similarly, ""STUNG"" has distinct: S,T,U,N,G -> distinct.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.

But let's make sure: can we use ""POINT""? Yes.

So I'll go with ""POINT"".

Therefore, the second guess is ""POINT"".

Format: <guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where:
- C, R, A, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"")
- N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, marked with ""✓"")

The secret word:
- Must have ""N"" as the 4th letter
- Must not contain C, R, A, or E

For the second guess, I chose ""POINT"" because:
- It places ""N"" in the 4th position as required
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)
- It introduces new, common letters: P, O, I, T
- These letters cover vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T) to maximize information
- All letters are distinct to test more possibilities

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the second guess ""point"":
- P: x -> not in the word
- O: x -> not in the word
- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, since in ""point"", I is the third letter)
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, as before)
- T: x -> not in the word

So now we know:
- The secret word has ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, T (from both guesses).

Additionally, we know the word must be of the form: _ _ I N _

We need to avoid the letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use I and N, but they are already placed).

We must form a 5-letter word with the pattern _ _ I N _.

We should choose a word that uses common letters from the available set to maximize information.

Common letters to consider: S, U, L, D, M, H, G, B, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and use only the available letters.

Possible words:
- ""BLINK"": B L I N K -> but we have B, L, I, N, K. However, we don't know about B, L, K. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters? B, L, K are allowed. But wait, ""BLINK"" has I at position 3 and N at 4? 
  Positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> yes, matches.
  But we have to check if any letter is forbidden: B, L, K are not in the forbidden list (A,C,E,O,P,R,T). So it's allowed.

- ""CLINK"": but C is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""FLING"": F L I N G -> F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: F, L, G -> allowed? F, L, G are not forbidden. So yes.

- ""SLING"": S L I N G -> S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, L, G are allowed.

- ""STING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""SWING"": S W I N G -> S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, W, G allowed.

- ""BRING"": B R I N G -> but R is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""THING"": T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> D(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). D, Y, G allowed.

- ""FLINT"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""BLIND"": B L I N D -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). B, L, D allowed.

- ""BLIMP"": but P is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""GLINT"": T forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""QUINT"": Q U I N T -> T forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""JUIN?"": not a word.

We have several candidates: ""BLINK"", ""FLING"", ""SLING"", ""SWING"", ""DYING"", ""BLIND"".

We want to choose one that uses letters we haven't tested yet and are common.

We haven't tested: S, B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

In ""BLINK"": tests B, L, K (and I and N are known).
In ""FLING"": tests F, L, G.
In ""SLING"": tests S, L, G.
In ""SWING"": tests S, W, G.
In ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G.
In ""BLIND"": tests B, L, D.

We know I and N are fixed, so we are only testing the first, second, and fifth letters.

We should avoid using letters that might be less common? But we need to cover as many possibilities.

Note: We have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

I think ""SLING"" is a good candidate because S and L are very common letters.

Alternatively, ""SWING"" has W, which is less common, so maybe not.

""BLINK"" has K, which is also common.

But let's see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

We can also consider ""SHINY"": but position? S H I N Y -> I is at position 3? S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes. And letters: S, H, Y -> allowed? H and Y are not forbidden. So ""SHINY"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""WHINY"": W H I N Y -> same, W and H.

But we don't know about H.

Another: ""SKIN?"": but we need 5 letters. ""SKINS"" is 5 letters but ends with S? Pattern is _ _ I N _, so fifth letter must be something. ""SKINS"" is S K I N S -> but that has I at position 3? S(1), K(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But S is repeated? And we don't know if S is in the word. But it's allowed? The word must have the pattern, and S is at position 1 and 5. But we are testing, so it's okay? However, repeating S might not be efficient because if S is in the word, we might not know where. But since we are testing position 1 and 5, it could be useful? Actually, if S is in the word, we get feedback for both positions. But it's not ideal for information.

So better to avoid repeats.

Therefore, ""SKINS"" is not great because of the repeated S.

Stick with distinct letters.

Another word: ""BUILD"": but I is at position 3? B U I L D -> B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> but we need N at position 4, not L. So no.

We must have I at 3 and N at 4.

So the word must be: ? ? I N ?

I think ""SLING"" is a good choice: common letters S, L, G.

""FLING"" is also good: F, L, G.

But F is less common than S? S is more common.

Similarly, ""BLIND"" has B, L, D.

I think S is the most common consonant, so let's go with a word that has S.

""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> I and N known, so testing S, L, G.

We can also consider ""SHINS"": but repeated S? S H I N S -> repeated S and we don't know if S is in the word. Not ideal.

""SHINE"": but E is forbidden -> not allowed.

""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> distinct letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N known, so testing S, H, Y.

H and Y are less common? But we have to test them.

I think ""SLING"" is better because L is more common than H.

Another candidate: ""SMITH"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

""SPRIG"": P and R forbidden -> not allowed.

""SWING"": S W I N G -> testing S, W, G. W is less common.

""BLINK"": B L I N K -> testing B, L, K. B and K are common.

But S is more common than B? In English, S is the most common letter at the end, but we are at the beginning.

Since we are testing the first, second, and fifth letters, we should cover common letters for those positions.

For position 1: common letters: S, B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, etc.
For position 2: vowels or common consonants? But we don't have many vowels left: we have U and Y (and sometimes W, Y as vowels). We already know A, E, I, O are not in the word? We know A, E, O are not in the word, but I is in the word at position 3. So the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, because it could have U or Y.

But in 5-letter words, there is usually at least two vowels? Not always, but often.

We have I as one vowel. It might have U or Y.

In ""SLING"": the vowels are I only? L, G are consonants. So it has only one vowel? But that's possible, e.g., ""lynch"", but we have I.

Similarly, ""BLINK"" has I and that's it? B, L, I, N, K -> only I as vowel? But that might be acceptable.

But let's check: ""lynch"" has Y as vowel. In ""BLINK"", I is the only vowel, which is acceptable.

But we might want to test a vowel? We have U and Y available.

In ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> Y is a vowel? So it has two vowels: Y and I. That might be good because we can check if Y is in the word.

Similarly, ""SHINY"" has I and Y.

So ""DYING"" or ""SHINY"" might be better to test a vowel.

But we don't know if the word has a vowel at position 2 or 5? It could.

Given that we have only one vowel (I) so far, and the word might have another vowel (U or Y), it would be good to test one of them.

So let's consider ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G. Y is a vowel.

""SHINY"": tests S, H, Y. Also Y.

""JUINY"" not a word.

""BUYIN"" not a word.

""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: L, Y, G -> allowed. And it has Y as a vowel.

So ""LYING"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""TYING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

So we have ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""SHINY"".

Now, among these, which one to choose?

""DYING"": D, Y, G
""LYING"": L, Y, G
""SHINY"": S, H, Y

We want to test common letters. S is more common than D or L? S is very common.

But H is less common.

Also, we are testing Y in all.

I think ""SHINY"" is good because it tests S and H, and Y.

But ""LYING"" tests L and Y, G.

G is common.

But S is the most common, so let's go with ""SHINY"" to test S and H.

Alternatively, we can choose ""SLING"" to test S and L, but without a vowel.

But we have to consider that the word might not have Y, so testing Y might not be necessary.

But we don't know, so it's better to test a vowel if possible.

Since we are at the third guess, and we have three positions to test (1,2,5), we can test one vowel and two consonants.

In ""SHINY"", we test S (consonant), H (consonant), Y (vowel). That's a good mix.

In ""LYING"", we test L (consonant), Y (vowel), G (consonant). Also good.

But S is more common than L, so ""SHINY"" might be better? But H is less common than G? H is more common than G? Let me think.

In English, the frequency of letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... So S is 7th, H is 8th, L is 11th, G is 16th, Y is 20th, etc.

So S and H are both in the top 10.

In ""SHINY"", we test S and H, which are high frequency, and Y which is less common but a vowel.

In ""LYING"", we test L (11th), Y (20th), G (16th) — lower frequency.

So ""SHINY"" seems better for covering common letters.

Also, ""SHINY"" is a common word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SHINY"".

But let's confirm the pattern: S H I N Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I (correct), 4:N (correct), 5:Y.

And letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N are known, so we are testing S, H, Y.

And no forbidden letters.

So guess: ""SHINY""

But note: we have to make sure that Y is allowed at the end. Yes, it is.

So I think that's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could choose ""SLING"" to avoid the less common Y? But then we don't test a vowel.

But let's see: if we guess ""SLING"", and it turns out the word has Y, we might not find it.

But we have to make a choice.

I think testing a vowel is important, so ""SHINY"" is better.

Another candidate: ""SWING"" has W, which is less common than H? W is 15th, H is 8th, so H is better.

So I'll go with ""SHINY"".

<guess>shiny</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - **C, R, A, E** are not in the word.  
- **Guess 2: ""point""** → Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - **N** is confirmed again at position 4.  
  - **P, O, T** are not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I N _` (positions: 1, 2, 3=I, 4=N, 5).  
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **A, C, E, O, P, R, T**.  
- Available letters (not yet tested or confirmed): **B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
- Since the word must contain at least one vowel (besides I), and **A, E, O** are excluded, the remaining vowel possibilities are **U** or **Y** (or rarely, **W** as part of a diphthong).  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- **Goal:** Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, L, D) and the vowel **Y** (to cover vowel possibilities).  
- **Pattern constraint:** Must be `_ _ I N _`.  
- **Avoid:** Repeating excluded letters or known letters unnecessarily.  
- **Ideal word:** Uses distinct, untested letters to maximize information.  

### Why ""shiny""?
- **Fits the pattern:** `S H I N Y` → Positions 3 and 4 are fixed as **I** and **N**.  
- **Tests key letters:**  
  - **S** (high-frequency consonant, position 1).  
  - **H** (common consonant, position 2).  
  - **Y** (vowel candidate, position 5; tests if the word has a second vowel).  
- **Avoids excluded letters:** No A, C, E, O, P, R, T.  
- **Distinct letters:** All letters are unique, testing three new positions (1, 2, 5) efficiently.  
- **Common word:** ""Shiny"" is a valid English word, reducing the risk of invalid guesses.  

If ""shiny"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal:  
- Whether **S** is in the word (and if so, its position).  
- Whether **H** is in the word (and if so, its position).  
- Whether **Y** is in the word (and if so, its position).  

This will significantly narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

We need to test other positions.\n\nI am leaning toward ""POINT"" because it has common letters: P, O, I, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""STUNG"" has S,T,U,N,G.\n\nBut since N is fixed at 4, in ""POINT"" we have:\n- Position 1: P\n- Position 2: O\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: N (known)\n- Position 5: T\n\nThat gives us information about positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nSimilarly, ""STUNG"": \n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: T\n- Position 3: U\n- Position 4: N\n- Position 5: G\n\nWe haven\'t tested S, T, U, G.\n\nBut ""POINT"" includes the vowels O and I, which might be more informative.\n\nI recall that in Wordle strategy, we often want to cover vowels. In our first guess ""crane"", we tested A and E, both excluded. So the word must have other vowels: I,O,U or sometimes Y.\n\nTherefore, testing O and I in ""POINT"" might be good.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has O or I. It could have U or something.\n\nBut for maximizing information, let\'s go with ""POINT"".\n\nAnother idea: since we know N at position 4, and we know the word doesn\'t have A,C,E,R, we might choose a word that uses the letter S? S is very common.\n\nBut ""POINT"" has no S.\n\nAlternatively, we could do ""STINT"": S T I N T -> but then T is at positions 2 and 5? That would be S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But T at position 2 and 5? That\'s using T twice. Not good because we are wasting a slot on a repeated letter.\n\nBetter to use distinct letters.\n\nSo, ""POINT"" has distinct letters: P,O,I,N,T -> that\'s good.\n\nSimilarly, ""STUNG"" has distinct: S,T,U,N,G -> distinct.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let\'s make sure: can we use ""POINT""? Yes.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""POINT"".\n\nTherefore, the second guess is ""POINT"".\n\nFormat: <guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where:\n- C, R, A, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"")\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, marked with ""✓"")\n\nThe secret word:\n- Must have ""N"" as the 4th letter\n- Must not contain C, R, A, or E\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""POINT"" because:\n- It places ""N"" in the 4th position as required\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)\n- It introduces new, common letters: P, O, I, T\n- These letters cover vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T) to maximize information\n- All letters are distinct to test more possibilities\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the second guess ""point"":\n- P: x -> not in the word\n- O: x -> not in the word\n- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, since in ""point"", I is the third letter)\n- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, as before)\n- T: x -> not in the word\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, T (from both guesses).\n\nAdditionally, we know the word must be of the form: _ _ I N _\n\nWe need to avoid the letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use I and N, but they are already placed).\n\nWe must form a 5-letter word with the pattern _ _ I N _.\n\nWe should choose a word that uses common letters from the available set to maximize information.\n\nCommon letters to consider: S, U, L, D, M, H, G, B, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern and use only the available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BLINK"": B L I N K -> but we have B, L, I, N, K. However, we don\'t know about B, L, K. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters? B, L, K are allowed. But wait, ""BLINK"" has I at position 3 and N at 4? \n  Positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> yes, matches.\n  But we have to check if any letter is forbidden: B, L, K are not in the forbidden list (A,C,E,O,P,R,T). So it\'s allowed.\n\n- ""CLINK"": but C is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""FLING"": F L I N G -> F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: F, L, G -> allowed? F, L, G are not forbidden. So yes.\n\n- ""SLING"": S L I N G -> S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, L, G are allowed.\n\n- ""STING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""SWING"": S W I N G -> S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, W, G allowed.\n\n- ""BRING"": B R I N G -> but R is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""THING"": T is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> D(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). D, Y, G allowed.\n\n- ""FLINT"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""BLIND"": B L I N D -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). B, L, D allowed.\n\n- ""BLIMP"": but P is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""GLINT"": T forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""QUINT"": Q U I N T -> T forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""JUIN?"": not a word.\n\nWe have several candidates: ""BLINK"", ""FLING"", ""SLING"", ""SWING"", ""DYING"", ""BLIND"".\n\nWe want to choose one that uses letters we haven\'t tested yet and are common.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: S, B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nIn ""BLINK"": tests B, L, K (and I and N are known).\nIn ""FLING"": tests F, L, G.\nIn ""SLING"": tests S, L, G.\nIn ""SWING"": tests S, W, G.\nIn ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G.\nIn ""BLIND"": tests B, L, D.\n\nWe know I and N are fixed, so we are only testing the first, second, and fifth letters.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that might be less common? But we need to cover as many possibilities.\n\nNote: We have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.\n\nI think ""SLING"" is a good candidate because S and L are very common letters.\n\nAlternatively, ""SWING"" has W, which is less common, so maybe not.\n\n""BLINK"" has K, which is also common.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHINY"": but position? S H I N Y -> I is at position 3? S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes. And letters: S, H, Y -> allowed? H and Y are not forbidden. So ""SHINY"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""WHINY"": W H I N Y -> same, W and H.\n\nBut we don\'t know about H.\n\nAnother: ""SKIN?"": but we need 5 letters. ""SKINS"" is 5 letters but ends with S? Pattern is _ _ I N _, so fifth letter must be something. ""SKINS"" is S K I N S -> but that has I at position 3? S(1), K(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But S is repeated? And we don\'t know if S is in the word. But it\'s allowed? The word must have the pattern, and S is at position 1 and 5. But we are testing, so it\'s okay? However, repeating S might not be efficient because if S is in the word, we might not know where. But since we are testing position 1 and 5, it could be useful? Actually, if S is in the word, we get feedback for both positions. But it\'s not ideal for information.\n\nSo better to avoid repeats.\n\nTherefore, ""SKINS"" is not great because of the repeated S.\n\nStick with distinct letters.\n\nAnother word: ""BUILD"": but I is at position 3? B U I L D -> B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> but we need N at position 4, not L. So no.\n\nWe must have I at 3 and N at 4.\n\nSo the word must be: ? ? I N ?\n\nI think ""SLING"" is a good choice: common letters S, L, G.\n\n""FLING"" is also good: F, L, G.\n\nBut F is less common than S? S is more common.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLIND"" has B, L, D.\n\nI think S is the most common consonant, so let\'s go with a word that has S.\n\n""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> I and N known, so testing S, L, G.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHINS"": but repeated S? S H I N S -> repeated S and we don\'t know if S is in the word. Not ideal.\n\n""SHINE"": but E is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> distinct letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N known, so testing S, H, Y.\n\nH and Y are less common? But we have to test them.\n\nI think ""SLING"" is better because L is more common than H.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SMITH"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n""SPRIG"": P and R forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n""SWING"": S W I N G -> testing S, W, G. W is less common.\n\n""BLINK"": B L I N K -> testing B, L, K. B and K are common.\n\nBut S is more common than B? In English, S is the most common letter at the end, but we are at the beginning.\n\nSince we are testing the first, second, and fifth letters, we should cover common letters for those positions.\n\nFor position 1: common letters: S, B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, etc.\nFor position 2: vowels or common consonants? But we don\'t have many vowels left: we have U and Y (and sometimes W, Y as vowels). We already know A, E, I, O are not in the word? We know A, E, O are not in the word, but I is in the word at position 3. So the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, because it could have U or Y.\n\nBut in 5-letter words, there is usually at least two vowels? Not always, but often.\n\nWe have I as one vowel. It might have U or Y.\n\nIn ""SLING"": the vowels are I only? L, G are consonants. So it has only one vowel? But that\'s possible, e.g., ""lynch"", but we have I.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLINK"" has I and that\'s it? B, L, I, N, K -> only I as vowel? But that might be acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s check: ""lynch"" has Y as vowel. In ""BLINK"", I is the only vowel, which is acceptable.\n\nBut we might want to test a vowel? We have U and Y available.\n\nIn ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> Y is a vowel? So it has two vowels: Y and I. That might be good because we can check if Y is in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHINY"" has I and Y.\n\nSo ""DYING"" or ""SHINY"" might be better to test a vowel.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has a vowel at position 2 or 5? It could.\n\nGiven that we have only one vowel (I) so far, and the word might have another vowel (U or Y), it would be good to test one of them.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G. Y is a vowel.\n\n""SHINY"": tests S, H, Y. Also Y.\n\n""JUINY"" not a word.\n\n""BUYIN"" not a word.\n\n""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: L, Y, G -> allowed. And it has Y as a vowel.\n\nSo ""LYING"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""TYING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\nSo we have ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""SHINY"".\n\nNow, among these, which one to choose?\n\n""DYING"": D, Y, G\n""LYING"": L, Y, G\n""SHINY"": S, H, Y\n\nWe want to test common letters. S is more common than D or L? S is very common.\n\nBut H is less common.\n\nAlso, we are testing Y in all.\n\nI think ""SHINY"" is good because it tests S and H, and Y.\n\nBut ""LYING"" tests L and Y, G.\n\nG is common.\n\nBut S is the most common, so let\'s go with ""SHINY"" to test S and H.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""SLING"" to test S and L, but without a vowel.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might not have Y, so testing Y might not be necessary.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so it\'s better to test a vowel if possible.\n\nSince we are at the third guess, and we have three positions to test (1,2,5), we can test one vowel and two consonants.\n\nIn ""SHINY"", we test S (consonant), H (consonant), Y (vowel). That\'s a good mix.\n\nIn ""LYING"", we test L (consonant), Y (vowel), G (consonant). Also good.\n\nBut S is more common than L, so ""SHINY"" might be better? But H is less common than G? H is more common than G? Let me think.\n\nIn English, the frequency of letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... So S is 7th, H is 8th, L is 11th, G is 16th, Y is 20th, etc.\n\nSo S and H are both in the top 10.\n\nIn ""SHINY"", we test S and H, which are high frequency, and Y which is less common but a vowel.\n\nIn ""LYING"", we test L (11th), Y (20th), G (16th) — lower frequency.\n\nSo ""SHINY"" seems better for covering common letters.\n\nAlso, ""SHINY"" is a common word.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""SHINY"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: S H I N Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I (correct), 4:N (correct), 5:Y.\n\nAnd letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N are known, so we are testing S, H, Y.\n\nAnd no forbidden letters.\n\nSo guess: ""SHINY""\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that Y is allowed at the end. Yes, it is.\n\nSo I think that\'s a good guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose ""SLING"" to avoid the less common Y? But then we don\'t test a vowel.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""SLING"", and it turns out the word has Y, we might not find it.\n\nBut we have to make a choice.\n\nI think testing a vowel is important, so ""SHINY"" is better.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SWING"" has W, which is less common than H? W is 15th, H is 8th, so H is better.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SHINY"".\n\n<guess>shiny</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  \n  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.  \n  - **C, R, A, E** are not in the word.  \n- **Guess 2: ""point""** → Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  \n  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  \n  - **N** is confirmed again at position 4.  \n  - **P, O, T** are not in the word.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I N _` (positions: 1, 2, 3=I, 4=N, 5).  \n- Excluded letters (not in the word): **A, C, E, O, P, R, T**.  \n- Available letters (not yet tested or confirmed): **B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  \n- Since the word must contain at least one vowel (besides I), and **A, E, O** are excluded, the remaining vowel possibilities are **U** or **Y** (or rarely, **W** as part of a diphthong).  \n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n- **Goal:** Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, L, D) and the vowel **Y** (to cover vowel possibilities).  \n- **Pattern constraint:** Must be `_ _ I N _`.  \n- **Avoid:** Repeating excluded letters or known letters unnecessarily.  \n- **Ideal word:** Uses distinct, untested letters to maximize information.  \n\n### Why ""shiny""?\n- **Fits the pattern:** `S H I N Y` → Positions 3 and 4 are fixed as **I** and **N**.  \n- **Tests key letters:**  \n  - **S** (high-frequency consonant, position 1).  \n  - **H** (common consonant, position 2).  \n  - **Y** (vowel candidate, position 5; tests if the word has a second vowel).  \n- **Avoids excluded letters:** No A, C, E, O, P, R, T.  \n- **Distinct letters:** All letters are unique, testing three new positions (1, 2, 5) efficiently.  \n- **Common word:** ""Shiny"" is a valid English word, reducing the risk of invalid guesses.  \n\nIf ""shiny"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal:  \n- Whether **S** is in the word (and if so, its position).  \n- Whether **H** is in the word (and if so, its position).  \n- Whether **Y** is in the word (and if so, its position).  \n\nThis will significantly narrow down possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>shiny</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: shiny -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) Y(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback from the third guess ""shiny"":
- S: x -> not in the word
- H: x -> not in the word
- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter)
- Y: - -> in the word but in the wrong position

So, from this feedback:
- The secret word has the letter 'Y' but not at position 5 (since it's marked as ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).
- The letters S and H are not in the word.

Now, combining with previous feedback:

Excluded letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T, S, H (from guesses 1, 2, and 3)

Confirmed positions:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N

And we know the word has Y, but not at position 5.

Since Y is in the word but not at position 5, and the only positions left are 1, 2, and 5, but position 5 is not Y, so Y must be at position 1 or 2.

Pattern: _ _ I N _

We know Y is in the word and must be at position 1 or 2.

Also, the word does not contain: A, C, E, H, O, P, R, S, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but Y is already known to be in the word, so we can use it, but we need to place it at position 1 or 2).

We must form a word that has Y at position 1 or 2, and I at 3, N at 4, and the fifth letter is unknown.

Also, the word must not contain the excluded letters.

Now, for the fourth guess, we need to test possibilities for the remaining positions.

We know Y is at 1 or 2. We can try to fix Y at position 1 and see what words are possible, or at position 2.

But we need to make a guess that will help us distinguish.

We should also test other common letters for the remaining positions.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and constraints.

First, if Y is at position 1:
- Pattern: Y _ I N _
- The second letter can be one of the available letters, and the fifth letter one of the available letters, but not excluded.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Similarly, if Y is at position 2:
- Pattern: _ Y I N _

Now, we need to choose a guess that can test both possibilities? Or we can commit to one and see.

But we have three positions to determine: 1, 2, and 5, but with Y being at 1 or 2, so if we fix Y at one position, we can test the other.

We can also choose a word that has Y at position 1 and then test common letters for 2 and 5, or vice versa.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6).

We should try to cover as many letters as possible.

Since Y is the only vowel we know besides I, and we have to have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but the word might have U or other.

But we have Y, so that's covered.

Now, let's think of words that fit.

First, with Y at position 1: Y _ I N _

Possible words:
- ""YOGIN"": but O is excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUKIN"": not a word? 
- ""YULIN"": not a common word? 
- ""YAPON"": A and O excluded -> invalid.
- ""YAWIN"": A excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUCKY"": but C and K? C is excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUCKS"": C and S excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUGAS"": S excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUKKY"": K and Y repeated? But K is allowed? But ""YUKKY"" is not a word? 
- ""YULAN"": A excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUPON"": O and P excluded -> invalid.

It's hard to find words with Y at 1 and then a vowel? But we have U available.

""YUMMY"": M and Y repeated? But ""YUMMY"" has Y at 1 and 5, and U at 2? Pattern: Y U M M Y -> but position 3 is M, but we need I at 3? No, position 3 must be I, so ""YUMMY"" doesn't have I at 3.

We need the third letter to be I.

So, for Y at 1: Y ? I N ?

The second letter must be a consonant or vowel that can form a word.

Possible words:
- ""YDI?"": not a word.
- ""YF?"": not.

Actually, I can't think of many. Let me list valid English words.

Common words: 
- ""BEGIN"": but B E G I N -> E is excluded -> invalid.
- ""BLUIN"": not a word.

Perhaps ""LYING"": but we already guessed ""shiny"", and ""lying"" has Y at position 2? Not at 1.

With Y at 1, I think ""YOWIE"": but O and E excluded -> invalid.

""YUKON"": O excluded -> invalid.

""YUPON"": O and P excluded.

It seems difficult. Maybe Y at position 1 is not common.

Now, with Y at position 2: _ Y I N _

Pattern: ? Y I N ?

This is more promising.

For example:
- ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> this is a word. And D, G are not excluded? D and G are allowed.
- ""FLYING"": F L Y I N G -> but that's 6 letters? No, ""FLYING"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.
- ""TYING"": T excluded -> invalid.
- ""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L, Y, I, N, G -> L and G allowed? Yes. And we haven't tested L or G.
- ""VYING"": V Y I N G -> V is allowed? Yes. V, Y, I, N, G.
- ""MYTHS"": but T and H excluded -> invalid.
- ""GYPSY"": P and S excluded -> invalid.
- ""BYLAW"": but A and W? A excluded -> invalid.
- ""CYTON"": C excluded -> invalid.
- ""GYNIC"": C excluded -> invalid.
- ""SYNOD"": S and O excluded -> invalid.

So the common words with Y at position 2 and I at 3: ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

We also have ""PYLON"", but P and O excluded.

""HYMNS"": H excluded -> invalid.

So the candidates are: ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

Now, we also have the fifth letter to consider.

In ""DYING"": fifth letter is G.
In ""LYING"": fifth letter is G.
In ""VYING"": fifth letter is G.

All end with G? Not necessarily, but in these words they do.

Are there others? ""MYN?"": not a word.

""WYNDS"": but S excluded -> invalid.

""XYST?"": not common.

So the main candidates are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

We need to choose one to guess.

But note: we also have to consider that the fifth letter might not be G? But in the pattern, it could be something else.

For example, is there a word like ""XYLIC""? But C excluded and X Y L I C -> position 3 is L, not I? No.

Or ""BYSSI"": S excluded and not I at 3.

I think ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"" are the main ones.

But we know Y is in the word and not at position 5, so in these words, Y is at position 2, which is consistent.

Now, for the guess, we can choose one of these to test.

But if we guess one of them and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback.

But we need to maximize information.

We have not tested D, L, V, or G yet.

G is common, so if we guess one of these, we test G at position 5.

But if we guess ""DYING"", we test D at 1 and G at 5.

Similarly, ""LYING"" tests L at 1 and G at 5.

""VYING"" tests V at 1 and G at 5.

V is less common than D or L.

So we should choose between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"".

D and L are both common.

We can choose ""LYING"" because L is slightly more common than D? Or D?

Letter frequency: L is more common than D (L is 11th, D is 10th? Actually, D is 9th, L is 10th? Close).

But we can also consider that we might get information about the first letter.

Another thing: we know that the word has Y, so if we guess a word with Y at position 2, and if it's correct, we get confirmation.

But we already know Y is in the word, so the feedback will tell us if Y is at position 2 or not? Not exactly, because if we put Y at position 2 and it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get - or x? But we know Y is in the word, so if we put it at position 2 and it's not there, we still get - meaning it's elsewhere, but we know it must be at position 1 or 2, so if it's not at 2, it must be at 1.

Similarly, if we put it at 1 and it's not there, it must be at 2.

So we can use the guess to pin down the position of Y.

But in this case, for the fourth guess, we can choose to put Y at position 1 or 2.

But earlier we saw that words with Y at 1 are rare, so it's more likely at 2.

Therefore, we can guess one of ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

I think ""LYING"" is a good choice because L is common.

But we already have feedback that S and H are not in the word, so no issue.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has Y at position 1 to test that possibility, but it might be hard to find.

For example, is there a word like ""YINCE""? Not a word.

""YITIE""? Not.

""YLIKE""? Not.

I think it's safer to assume Y is at position 2.

So let's choose between ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

""VYING"" has V, which is less common, so we might avoid that.

Between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"", both are valid.

We can choose ""LYING"" because it uses L, which we haven't tested.

But we haven't tested D either.

We can also consider that in ""LYING"", if we guess it, and it's not correct, we get feedback on L and G.

Similarly for ""DYING"".

But note: we have to consider the fifth letter. In all these, it's G, so if G is not in the word, we know that none of these are the word, and Y must be at position 1? But we don't have a word for that.

But if G is not in the word, then we know the fifth letter is not G, and Y must be at position 1, and we need to find a word with Y at 1 and I at 3, N at 4, and a fifth letter.

But as we saw, such words are rare, so it might be that G is in the word.

We can also choose a word that has Y at position 1 to directly test that.

For example, is there a valid word with Y at 1? Let's search.

""YCLAD"": C excluded -> invalid.

""YDRAD"": not a word.

""YFERE"": E excluded -> invalid.

""YIKES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.

""YIRTH"": H excluded -> invalid.

""YLIKE"": not a word.

""YMOLT"": O excluded -> invalid.

""YMPES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.

""YOGIN"": O excluded -> invalid.

""YOKED"": O, E, D? O and E excluded -> invalid.

""YONIC"": O and C excluded -> invalid.

""YORES"": O, E, S excluded -> invalid.

""YOUKS"": O, U, K, S? O excluded -> invalid.

""YOURS"": O, U, R, S excluded -> invalid.

""YOWES"": O, E, S excluded -> invalid.

""YOWIE"": O, E, I? O and E excluded -> invalid.

""YRApt"": not a word.

""YRENT"": E excluded -> invalid.

""YRIVD"": not a word.

""YRNEH"": not a word.

""YSLUM"": S excluded -> invalid.

""YTOST"": O and T excluded -> invalid.

""YUANS"": A, U, S excluded -> invalid.

""YUCCH"": C and H excluded -> invalid.

""YUCKY"": C and K? C excluded -> invalid.

""YUGAS"": S excluded -> invalid.

""YUKKY"": K excluded? K is allowed, but ""YUKKY"" is not a standard word? It might be slang, but let's avoid.

""YULES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.

""YUMMY"": M and Y repeated, and no I at 3 -> invalid.

""YURTA"": U, R, T, A? A, R, T excluded -> invalid.

I cannot find a valid 5-letter word with Y at position 1, I at 3, N at 4, and without excluded letters.

Therefore, it is highly likely that Y is at position 2.

So the word must be of the form _ Y I N _

And the candidates are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"", and possibly others with different fifth letters.

But earlier I thought of only those three, but is there a word with a different fifth letter?

For example, ""MYTHI"": H and T excluded -> invalid.

""SYNCH"": S and H excluded -> invalid.

""WYNDS"": S excluded -> invalid.

""XYLIC"": C excluded -> invalid.

""BYNIN"": not a word.

""KYLIN"": K Y L I N -> but that's K at 1, Y at 2, L at 3? But we need I at 3, not L. ""KYLIN"" has I at position 4? K(1), Y(2), L(3), I(4), N(5) -> but we need I at 3 and N at 4, so position 4 is I, not N. So no.

""PYINS"": P and S excluded -> invalid.

""TYI?"": T excluded.

""ZYMIN"": M I N? Z Y M I N -> Z(1), Y(2), M(3), I(4), N(5) -> again, I at 4, not 3.

So no, the only common words are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

Therefore, we should guess one of these.

Now, to choose, we can pick ""LYING"" because L is more common than D or V? L is more common than V, but D and L are close.

Since we have three options, and we need to test, we can choose the most common one.

""LYING"" is a very common word.

We can also consider that if we guess ""LYING"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on L and G.

Similarly for others.

But let's see the frequency: ""LYING"" is more common than ""DYING"" or ""VYING"".

""DYING"" is also common.

But ""VYING"" is less common.

So between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"", I'll choose ""LYING"".

So the guess is ""LYING"".

But note: in ""LYING"", the letters are L, Y, I, N, G.

We know I and N are correct and in place.

Y is in the word but we are testing it at position 2.

L is at position 1, G at position 5.

If the word is ""LYING"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on L and G.

If L is not in the word, then we know the first letter must be D or V (from the candidates).

Similarly, if G is not in the word, then none of the candidates are valid, but we know Y must be at position 2, so the fifth letter must be something else, but we don't have a candidate, so it might be a rare word.

But let's hope it's one of the common ones.

So I'll go with ""LYING"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - **C, R, A, E** are not in the word.  
- **Guess 2: ""point""** → Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - **N** is confirmed again at position 4.  
  - **P, O, T** are not in the word.  
- **Guess 3: ""shiny""** → Feedback: S(x), H(x), I(✓), N(✓), Y(-)  
  - **I** and **N** are confirmed at positions 3 and 4.  
  - **S** and **H** are not in the word.  
  - **Y** is in the word but not at position 5.  

### Deductions:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ I N _` (positions: 1, 2, 3=I, 4=N, 5).  
- **Excluded letters** (not in the word): A, C, E, H, O, P, R, S, T.  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: I, N, Y.  
  - **Y** must be at position 1 or 2 (since it is in the word but not at position 5).  
- **Available letters** (not tested or confirmed): B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Key constraints**:  
  - Position 1: Must be one of B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but Y could be here).  
  - Position 2: Must be Y or another available letter (but Y must be at position 1 or 2).  
  - Position 5: Must be one of the available letters.  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test the position of **Y** (position 1 or 2) and cover common consonants for the remaining positions.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Since **Y** must be at position 1 or 2, and no valid 5-letter words exist with **Y** at position 1 (based on pattern `Y _ I N _` and excluded letters), **Y** is likely at position 2.  
  - Focus on words with the pattern `_ Y I N _` to test this.  
  - Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, D, G) for positions 1 and 5 to maximize information.  
- **Word choice**: ""lying"" fits perfectly:  
  - Pattern: `L Y I N G` → Tests **L** at position 1, **Y** at position 2, and **G** at position 5.  
  - Uses distinct, untested letters (L, G) and confirms **Y** placement.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  
- **Why not other candidates?**  
  - ""dying"" and ""vying"" are alternatives, but ""lying"" uses **L** (more common than **D** or **V**) and is a high-frequency word.  
  - If ""lying"" is incorrect, feedback on **L** and **G** will quickly narrow possibilities (e.g., if **L** is absent, position 1 must be **D** or **V**; if **G** is absent, position 5 is another letter).  

<guess>lying</guess>",lying,"We are given feedback from the third guess ""shiny"":
- S: x -> not in the word
- H: x -> not in the word
- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter)
- Y: - -> in the word but in the wrong position

So, from this feedback:
- The secret word has the letter 'Y' but not at position 5 (since it's marked as ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).
- The letters S and H are not in the word.

Now, combining with previous feedback:

Excluded letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T, S, H (from guesses 1, 2, and 3)

Confirmed positions:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N

And we know the word has Y, but not at position 5.

Since Y is in the word but not at position 5, and the only positions left are 1, 2, and 5, but position 5 is not Y, so Y must be at position 1 or 2.

Pattern: _ _ I N _

We know Y is in the word and must be at position 1 or 2.

Also, the word does not contain: A, C, E, H, O, P, R, S, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but Y is already known to be in the word, so we can use it, but we need to place it at position 1 or 2).

We must form a word that has Y at position 1 or 2, and I at 3, N at 4, and the fifth letter is unknown.

Also, the word must not contain the excluded letters.

Now, for the fourth guess, we need to test possibilities for the remaining positions.

We know Y is at 1 or 2. We can try to fix Y at position 1 and see what words are possible, or at position 2.

But we need to make a guess that will help us distinguish.

We should also test other common letters for the remaining positions.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and constraints.

First, if Y is at position 1:
- Pattern: Y _ I N _
- The second letter can be one of the available letters, and the fifth letter one of the available letters, but not excluded.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Similarly, if Y is at position 2:
- Pattern: _ Y I N _

Now, we need to choose a guess that can test both possibilities? Or we can commit to one and see.

But we have three positions to determine: 1, 2, and 5, but with Y being at 1 or 2, so if we fix Y at one position, we can test the other.

We can also choose a word that has Y at position 1 and then test common letters for 2 and 5, or vice versa.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6).

We should try to cover as many letters as possible.

Since Y is the only vowel we know besides I, and we have to have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but the word might have U or other.

But we have Y, so that's covered.

Now, let's think of words that fit.

First, with Y at position 1: Y _ I N _

Possible words:
- ""YOGIN"": but O is excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUKIN"": not a word? 
- ""YULIN"": not a common word? 
- ""YAPON"": A and O excluded -> invalid.
- ""YAWIN"": A excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUCKY"": but C and K? C is excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUCKS"": C and S excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUGAS"": S excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUKKY"": K and Y repeated? But K is allowed? But ""YUKKY"" is not a word? 
- ""YULAN"": A excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUPON"": O and P excluded -> invalid.

It's hard to find words with Y at 1 and then a vowel? But we have U available.

""YUMMY"": M and Y repeated? But ""YUMMY"" has Y at 1 and 5, and U at 2? Pattern: Y U M M Y -> but position 3 is M, but we need I at 3? No, position 3 must be I, so ""YUMMY"" doesn't have I at 3.

We need the third letter to be I.

So, for Y at 1: Y ? I N ?

The second letter must be a consonant or vowel that can form a word.

Possible words:
- ""YDI?"": not a word.
- ""YF?"": not.

Actually, I can't think of many. Let me list valid English words.

Common words: 
- ""BEGIN"": but B E G I N -> E is excluded -> invalid.
- ""BLUIN"": not a word.

Perhaps ""LYING"": but we already guessed ""shiny"", and ""lying"" has Y at position 2? Not at 1.

With Y at 1, I think ""YOWIE"": but O and E excluded -> invalid.

""YUKON"": O excluded -> invalid.

""YUPON"": O and P excluded.

It seems difficult. Maybe Y at position 1 is not common.

Now, with Y at position 2: _ Y I N _

Pattern: ? Y I N ?

This is more promising.

For example:
- ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> this is a word. And D, G are not excluded? D and G are allowed.
- ""FLYING"": F L Y I N G -> but that's 6 letters? No, ""FLYING"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.
- ""TYING"": T excluded -> invalid.
- ""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L, Y, I, N, G -> L and G allowed? Yes. And we haven't tested L or G.
- ""VYING"": V Y I N G -> V is allowed? Yes. V, Y, I, N, G.
- ""MYTHS"": but T and H excluded -> invalid.
- ""GYPSY"": P and S excluded -> invalid.
- ""BYLAW"": but A and W? A excluded -> invalid.
- ""CYTON"": C excluded -> invalid.
- ""GYNIC"": C excluded -> invalid.
- ""SYNOD"": S and O excluded -> invalid.

So the common words with Y at position 2 and I at 3: ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

We also have ""PYLON"", but P and O excluded.

""HYMNS"": H excluded -> invalid.

So the candidates are: ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

Now, we also have the fifth letter to consider.

In ""DYING"": fifth letter is G.
In ""LYING"": fifth letter is G.
In ""VYING"": fifth letter is G.

All end with G? Not necessarily, but in these words they do.

Are there others? ""MYN?"": not a word.

""WYNDS"": but S excluded -> invalid.

""XYST?"": not common.

So the main candidates are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

We need to choose one to guess.

But note: we also have to consider that the fifth letter might not be G? But in the pattern, it could be something else.

For example, is there a word like ""XYLIC""? But C excluded and X Y L I C -> position 3 is L, not I? No.

Or ""BYSSI"": S excluded and not I at 3.

I think ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"" are the main ones.

But we know Y is in the word and not at position 5, so in these words, Y is at position 2, which is consistent.

Now, for the guess, we can choose one of these to test.

But if we guess one of them and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback.

But we need to maximize information.

We have not tested D, L, V, or G yet.

G is common, so if we guess one of these, we test G at position 5.

But if we guess ""DYING"", we test D at 1 and G at 5.

Similarly, ""LYING"" tests L at 1 and G at 5.

""VYING"" tests V at 1 and G at 5.

V is less common than D or L.

So we should choose between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"".

D and L are both common.

We can choose ""LYING"" because L is slightly more common than D? Or D?

Letter frequency: L is more common than D (L is 11th, D is 10th? Actually, D is 9th, L is 10th? Close).

But we can also consider that we might get information about the first letter.

Another thing: we know that the word has Y, so if we guess a word with Y at position 2, and if it's correct, we get confirmation.

But we already know Y is in the word, so the feedback will tell us if Y is at position 2 or not? Not exactly, because if we put Y at position 2 and it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get - or x? But we know Y is in the word, so if we put it at position 2 and it's not there, we still get - meaning it's elsewhere, but we know it must be at position 1 or 2, so if it's not at 2, it must be at 1.

Similarly, if we put it at 1 and it's not there, it must be at 2.

So we can use the guess to pin down the position of Y.

But in this case, for the fourth guess, we can choose to put Y at position 1 or 2.

But earlier we saw that words with Y at 1 are rare, so it's more likely at 2.

Therefore, we can guess one of ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

I think ""LYING"" is a good choice because L is common.

But we already have feedback that S and H are not in the word, so no issue.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has Y at position 1 to test that possibility, but it might be hard to find.

For example, is there a word like ""YINCE""? Not a word.

""YITIE""? Not.

""YLIKE""? Not.

I think it's safer to assume Y is at position 2.

So let's choose between ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

""VYING"" has V, which is less common, so we might avoid that.

Between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"", both are valid.

We can choose ""LYING"" because it uses L, which we haven't tested.

But we haven't tested D either.

We can also consider that in ""LYING"", if we guess it, and it's not correct, we get feedback on L and G.

Similarly for ""DYING"".

But note: we have to consider the fifth letter. In all these, it's G, so if G is not in the word, we know that none of these are the word, and Y must be at position 1? But we don't have a word for that.

But if G is not in the word, then we know the fifth letter is not G, and Y must be at position 1, and we need to find a word with Y at 1 and I at 3, N at 4, and a fifth letter.

But as we saw, such words are rare, so it might be that G is in the word.

We can also choose a word that has Y at position 1 to directly test that.

For example, is there a valid word with Y at 1? Let's search.

""YCLAD"": C excluded -> invalid.

""YDRAD"": not a word.

""YFERE"": E excluded -> invalid.

""YIKES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.

""YIRTH"": H excluded -> invalid.

""YLIKE"": not a word.

""YMOLT"": O excluded -> invalid.

""YMPES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.

""YOGIN"": O excluded -> invalid.

""YOKED"": O, E, D? O and E excluded -> invalid.

""YONIC"": O and C excluded -> invalid.

""YORES"": O, E, S excluded -> invalid.

""YOUKS"": O, U, K, S? O excluded -> invalid.

""YOURS"": O, U, R, S excluded -> invalid.

""YOWES"": O, E, S excluded -> invalid.

""YOWIE"": O, E, I? O and E excluded -> invalid.

""YRApt"": not a word.

""YRENT"": E excluded -> invalid.

""YRIVD"": not a word.

""YRNEH"": not a word.

""YSLUM"": S excluded -> invalid.

""YTOST"": O and T excluded -> invalid.

""YUANS"": A, U, S excluded -> invalid.

""YUCCH"": C and H excluded -> invalid.

""YUCKY"": C and K? C excluded -> invalid.

""YUGAS"": S excluded -> invalid.

""YUKKY"": K excluded? K is allowed, but ""YUKKY"" is not a standard word? It might be slang, but let's avoid.

""YULES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.

""YUMMY"": M and Y repeated, and no I at 3 -> invalid.

""YURTA"": U, R, T, A? A, R, T excluded -> invalid.

I cannot find a valid 5-letter word with Y at position 1, I at 3, N at 4, and without excluded letters.

Therefore, it is highly likely that Y is at position 2.

So the word must be of the form _ Y I N _

And the candidates are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"", and possibly others with different fifth letters.

But earlier I thought of only those three, but is there a word with a different fifth letter?

For example, ""MYTHI"": H and T excluded -> invalid.

""SYNCH"": S and H excluded -> invalid.

""WYNDS"": S excluded -> invalid.

""XYLIC"": C excluded -> invalid.

""BYNIN"": not a word.

""KYLIN"": K Y L I N -> but that's K at 1, Y at 2, L at 3? But we need I at 3, not L. ""KYLIN"" has I at position 4? K(1), Y(2), L(3), I(4), N(5) -> but we need I at 3 and N at 4, so position 4 is I, not N. So no.

""PYINS"": P and S excluded -> invalid.

""TYI?"": T excluded.

""ZYMIN"": M I N? Z Y M I N -> Z(1), Y(2), M(3), I(4), N(5) -> again, I at 4, not 3.

So no, the only common words are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

Therefore, we should guess one of these.

Now, to choose, we can pick ""LYING"" because L is more common than D or V? L is more common than V, but D and L are close.

Since we have three options, and we need to test, we can choose the most common one.

""LYING"" is a very common word.

We can also consider that if we guess ""LYING"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on L and G.

Similarly for others.

But let's see the frequency: ""LYING"" is more common than ""DYING"" or ""VYING"".

""DYING"" is also common.

But ""VYING"" is less common.

So between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"", I'll choose ""LYING"".

So the guess is ""LYING"".

But note: in ""LYING"", the letters are L, Y, I, N, G.

We know I and N are correct and in place.

Y is in the word but we are testing it at position 2.

L is at position 1, G at position 5.

If the word is ""LYING"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on L and G.

If L is not in the word, then we know the first letter must be D or V (from the candidates).

Similarly, if G is not in the word, then none of the candidates are valid, but we know Y must be at position 2, so the fifth letter must be something else, but we don't have a candidate, so it might be a rare word.

But let's hope it's one of the common ones.

So I'll go with ""LYING"".

 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let's choose one that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). Also, it doesn't repeat any letters.

<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess:
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: x -> not in the word
- A: x -> not in the word
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, since positions are 1-indexed? Actually, in the example they showed the positions as given. But note: in ""crane"", the fourth letter is N, so N is in the secret word at position 4.

Since the feedback was for ""crane"": 
  C (x) -> not present
  R (x) -> not present
  A (x) -> not present
  N (✓) -> present and at position 4
  E (x) -> not present

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have letter 'N' at position 4.
- Must NOT contain the letters C, R, A, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should pick a word that:
1. Has 'N' in the fourth position (since it's fixed per the feedback).
2. Does not contain the letters C, R, A, E (as they are not in the word).
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Possible words with 'N' at position 4? Let's think of 5-letter words ending with ...N? Actually position 4 is the fourth letter. So the pattern is: ? ? ? N ?

Since the word must have an 'N' at position 4, and must avoid C, R, A, E.

We can consider words like:
- WINDY, but let's check: W I N D Y -> N at pos 3? Wait, no: positions in a 5-letter word: 
  Position 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

In ""windy"": 
  Pos1: W, Pos2: I, Pos3: N, Pos4: D, Pos5: Y -> doesn't have N at 4.

We need words where the fourth letter is N. Examples:
- ""BLANK"": letters B, L, A, N, K -> but A is already excluded (feedback said A not in word), so cannot use A.
- ""CLINK"": has C -> excluded.
- ""SKUNK"": but has K at position 5? And U? Also, we don't know about K yet. But S? We don't know. But we cannot use C,R,A,E. So S is allowed? Let's list words.

Actually, common words with N at position 4:
- ""POINT"": P O I N T -> has I and O? But we don't know about O or I or T.
- ""JOINT"": J O I N T -> similar.
- ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> O and U? 
- ""DAUNT"": D A U N T -> but A is excluded (we know A is not in the word).
- ""COUNT"": C O U N T -> has C -> excluded.

We must avoid A, C, E, R.

Other possibilities:
- ""BOUND"": B O U N D -> no A,C,E,R? But O and U are unknown. Also, D at the end.
- ""FOUND"": F O U N D -> same, but F?
- ""POUND"": same.
- ""WOUND"": W O U N D -> same.

But note: we haven't used the fact that we can test other common letters.

Also, words without the forbidden letters: so we can use B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (except A, C, E, R).

We want to maximize information. So we should use letters that are frequently used, and avoid repeating letters we already know are absent.

Another word: ""SHOWN"": S H O W N -> positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4)? Wait, in ""shown"", the fourth letter is W? Then fifth is N? No, ""SHOWN"" has 5 letters: S-H-O-W-N? Actually, no: it's S-H-O-W-N? Wait, let me check.

Actually, ""SHOWN"" is S-H-O-W-N? That would be S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). We need N at position 4? Here N is at position 5. So incorrect.

We need a word with the fourth letter as N. So the word pattern: _ _ _ N _

Let me try to think of words: 
- ""BLUNT"": B L U N T -> fourth letter is N. And letters: B,L,U,T -> none of A,C,E,R? Yes. So it's a candidate.
- ""GRUNT"": G R U N T -> but R is excluded? R is not allowed because feedback said R(x) -> not in the word. So no R.
- ""STUNG"": S T U N G -> positions: S(1),T(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) -> has N at position 4. Letters: S,T,U,G -> none forbidden.

So ""STUNG"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""SWUNG"": S W U N G -> same, but with W.

Also, ""DOING"": D O I N G -> position: D(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> that fits. Letters: D,O,I,G -> none forbidden.

But note: in ""DOING"", the word has 'O','I','G', and we don't know about them.

Another: ""GOING"": G O I N G -> same as above, but starts with G.

We should choose a word that has as many new letters as possible and avoids the known absent ones.

My goal is to cover common vowels and consonants. We haven't tested: O, I, U, and consonants like S, T, L, D, etc.

I am considering ""STUNG"": 
- It has S, T, U, N, G -> N is fixed at position 4. We avoid forbidden letters.

But note: ""STUNG"" has the letter U, which is a vowel, and S,T,G are common.

Alternatively, ""BLIND"": but position? B L I N D -> N is at position 4? B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). Okay. But we cannot use BLIND? Because it has I? But we don't know. And letters: B, L, I, N, D -> none forbidden.

However, we already know N is at position 4, so we can fix that.

But wait, in ""BLIND"", the word has 'I' and 'D'. We have to see which gives more coverage.

I could also consider ""POINT"" but it has O and I? But note: ""POINT"" is P O I N T -> N at position 4? P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.

But we don't know about O, I, P, T.

We want to avoid previously excluded letters? Only A,C,E,R are excluded.

So POINT is valid? Letters: P, O, I, N, T -> no A,C,E,R.

Similarly, JOINT, but J is less common.

Another word: ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> letters M, O, U, N, T -> no forbidden.

But U is in there.

I think either ""POINT"", ""STUNG"", or ""BLUNT"" would be good.

But note: we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4). We need to test other positions.

I am leaning toward ""POINT"" because it has common letters: P, O, I, T.

Alternatively, ""STUNG"" has S,T,U,N,G.

But since N is fixed at 4, in ""POINT"" we have:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N (known)
- Position 5: T

That gives us information about positions 1,2,3,5.

Similarly, ""STUNG"": 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G

We haven't tested S, T, U, G.

But ""POINT"" includes the vowels O and I, which might be more informative.

I recall that in Wordle strategy, we often want to cover vowels. In our first guess ""crane"", we tested A and E, both excluded. So the word must have other vowels: I,O,U or sometimes Y.

Therefore, testing O and I in ""POINT"" might be good.

But note: we don't know if the word has O or I. It could have U or something.

But for maximizing information, let's go with ""POINT"".

Another idea: since we know N at position 4, and we know the word doesn't have A,C,E,R, we might choose a word that uses the letter S? S is very common.

But ""POINT"" has no S.

Alternatively, we could do ""STINT"": S T I N T -> but then T is at positions 2 and 5? That would be S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But T at position 2 and 5? That's using T twice. Not good because we are wasting a slot on a repeated letter.

Better to use distinct letters.

So, ""POINT"" has distinct letters: P,O,I,N,T -> that's good.

Similarly, ""STUNG"" has distinct: S,T,U,N,G -> distinct.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.

But let's make sure: can we use ""POINT""? Yes.

So I'll go with ""POINT"".

Therefore, the second guess is ""POINT"".

Format: <guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where:
- C, R, A, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"")
- N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, marked with ""✓"")

The secret word:
- Must have ""N"" as the 4th letter
- Must not contain C, R, A, or E

For the second guess, I chose ""POINT"" because:
- It places ""N"" in the 4th position as required
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)
- It introduces new, common letters: P, O, I, T
- These letters cover vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T) to maximize information
- All letters are distinct to test more possibilities

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the second guess ""point"":
- P: x -> not in the word
- O: x -> not in the word
- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, since in ""point"", I is the third letter)
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, as before)
- T: x -> not in the word

So now we know:
- The secret word has ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, T (from both guesses).

Additionally, we know the word must be of the form: _ _ I N _

We need to avoid the letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use I and N, but they are already placed).

We must form a 5-letter word with the pattern _ _ I N _.

We should choose a word that uses common letters from the available set to maximize information.

Common letters to consider: S, U, L, D, M, H, G, B, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and use only the available letters.

Possible words:
- ""BLINK"": B L I N K -> but we have B, L, I, N, K. However, we don't know about B, L, K. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters? B, L, K are allowed. But wait, ""BLINK"" has I at position 3 and N at 4? 
  Positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> yes, matches.
  But we have to check if any letter is forbidden: B, L, K are not in the forbidden list (A,C,E,O,P,R,T). So it's allowed.

- ""CLINK"": but C is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""FLING"": F L I N G -> F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: F, L, G -> allowed? F, L, G are not forbidden. So yes.

- ""SLING"": S L I N G -> S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, L, G are allowed.

- ""STING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""SWING"": S W I N G -> S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, W, G allowed.

- ""BRING"": B R I N G -> but R is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""THING"": T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> D(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). D, Y, G allowed.

- ""FLINT"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""BLIND"": B L I N D -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). B, L, D allowed.

- ""BLIMP"": but P is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""GLINT"": T forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""QUINT"": Q U I N T -> T forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""JUIN?"": not a word.

We have several candidates: ""BLINK"", ""FLING"", ""SLING"", ""SWING"", ""DYING"", ""BLIND"".

We want to choose one that uses letters we haven't tested yet and are common.

We haven't tested: S, B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

In ""BLINK"": tests B, L, K (and I and N are known).
In ""FLING"": tests F, L, G.
In ""SLING"": tests S, L, G.
In ""SWING"": tests S, W, G.
In ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G.
In ""BLIND"": tests B, L, D.

We know I and N are fixed, so we are only testing the first, second, and fifth letters.

We should avoid using letters that might be less common? But we need to cover as many possibilities.

Note: We have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

I think ""SLING"" is a good candidate because S and L are very common letters.

Alternatively, ""SWING"" has W, which is less common, so maybe not.

""BLINK"" has K, which is also common.

But let's see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

We can also consider ""SHINY"": but position? S H I N Y -> I is at position 3? S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes. And letters: S, H, Y -> allowed? H and Y are not forbidden. So ""SHINY"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""WHINY"": W H I N Y -> same, W and H.

But we don't know about H.

Another: ""SKIN?"": but we need 5 letters. ""SKINS"" is 5 letters but ends with S? Pattern is _ _ I N _, so fifth letter must be something. ""SKINS"" is S K I N S -> but that has I at position 3? S(1), K(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But S is repeated? And we don't know if S is in the word. But it's allowed? The word must have the pattern, and S is at position 1 and 5. But we are testing, so it's okay? However, repeating S might not be efficient because if S is in the word, we might not know where. But since we are testing position 1 and 5, it could be useful? Actually, if S is in the word, we get feedback for both positions. But it's not ideal for information.

So better to avoid repeats.

Therefore, ""SKINS"" is not great because of the repeated S.

Stick with distinct letters.

Another word: ""BUILD"": but I is at position 3? B U I L D -> B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> but we need N at position 4, not L. So no.

We must have I at 3 and N at 4.

So the word must be: ? ? I N ?

I think ""SLING"" is a good choice: common letters S, L, G.

""FLING"" is also good: F, L, G.

But F is less common than S? S is more common.

Similarly, ""BLIND"" has B, L, D.

I think S is the most common consonant, so let's go with a word that has S.

""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> I and N known, so testing S, L, G.

We can also consider ""SHINS"": but repeated S? S H I N S -> repeated S and we don't know if S is in the word. Not ideal.

""SHINE"": but E is forbidden -> not allowed.

""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> distinct letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N known, so testing S, H, Y.

H and Y are less common? But we have to test them.

I think ""SLING"" is better because L is more common than H.

Another candidate: ""SMITH"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

""SPRIG"": P and R forbidden -> not allowed.

""SWING"": S W I N G -> testing S, W, G. W is less common.

""BLINK"": B L I N K -> testing B, L, K. B and K are common.

But S is more common than B? In English, S is the most common letter at the end, but we are at the beginning.

Since we are testing the first, second, and fifth letters, we should cover common letters for those positions.

For position 1: common letters: S, B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, etc.
For position 2: vowels or common consonants? But we don't have many vowels left: we have U and Y (and sometimes W, Y as vowels). We already know A, E, I, O are not in the word? We know A, E, O are not in the word, but I is in the word at position 3. So the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, because it could have U or Y.

But in 5-letter words, there is usually at least two vowels? Not always, but often.

We have I as one vowel. It might have U or Y.

In ""SLING"": the vowels are I only? L, G are consonants. So it has only one vowel? But that's possible, e.g., ""lynch"", but we have I.

Similarly, ""BLINK"" has I and that's it? B, L, I, N, K -> only I as vowel? But that might be acceptable.

But let's check: ""lynch"" has Y as vowel. In ""BLINK"", I is the only vowel, which is acceptable.

But we might want to test a vowel? We have U and Y available.

In ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> Y is a vowel? So it has two vowels: Y and I. That might be good because we can check if Y is in the word.

Similarly, ""SHINY"" has I and Y.

So ""DYING"" or ""SHINY"" might be better to test a vowel.

But we don't know if the word has a vowel at position 2 or 5? It could.

Given that we have only one vowel (I) so far, and the word might have another vowel (U or Y), it would be good to test one of them.

So let's consider ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G. Y is a vowel.

""SHINY"": tests S, H, Y. Also Y.

""JUINY"" not a word.

""BUYIN"" not a word.

""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: L, Y, G -> allowed. And it has Y as a vowel.

So ""LYING"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""TYING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

So we have ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""SHINY"".

Now, among these, which one to choose?

""DYING"": D, Y, G
""LYING"": L, Y, G
""SHINY"": S, H, Y

We want to test common letters. S is more common than D or L? S is very common.

But H is less common.

Also, we are testing Y in all.

I think ""SHINY"" is good because it tests S and H, and Y.

But ""LYING"" tests L and Y, G.

G is common.

But S is the most common, so let's go with ""SHINY"" to test S and H.

Alternatively, we can choose ""SLING"" to test S and L, but without a vowel.

But we have to consider that the word might not have Y, so testing Y might not be necessary.

But we don't know, so it's better to test a vowel if possible.

Since we are at the third guess, and we have three positions to test (1,2,5), we can test one vowel and two consonants.

In ""SHINY"", we test S (consonant), H (consonant), Y (vowel). That's a good mix.

In ""LYING"", we test L (consonant), Y (vowel), G (consonant). Also good.

But S is more common than L, so ""SHINY"" might be better? But H is less common than G? H is more common than G? Let me think.

In English, the frequency of letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... So S is 7th, H is 8th, L is 11th, G is 16th, Y is 20th, etc.

So S and H are both in the top 10.

In ""SHINY"", we test S and H, which are high frequency, and Y which is less common but a vowel.

In ""LYING"", we test L (11th), Y (20th), G (16th) — lower frequency.

So ""SHINY"" seems better for covering common letters.

Also, ""SHINY"" is a common word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SHINY"".

But let's confirm the pattern: S H I N Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I (correct), 4:N (correct), 5:Y.

And letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N are known, so we are testing S, H, Y.

And no forbidden letters.

So guess: ""SHINY""

But note: we have to make sure that Y is allowed at the end. Yes, it is.

So I think that's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could choose ""SLING"" to avoid the less common Y? But then we don't test a vowel.

But let's see: if we guess ""SLING"", and it turns out the word has Y, we might not find it.

But we have to make a choice.

I think testing a vowel is important, so ""SHINY"" is better.

Another candidate: ""SWING"" has W, which is less common than H? W is 15th, H is 8th, so H is better.

So I'll go with ""SHINY"".

<guess>shiny</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - **C, R, A, E** are not in the word.  
- **Guess 2: ""point""** → Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - **N** is confirmed again at position 4.  
  - **P, O, T** are not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I N _` (positions: 1, 2, 3=I, 4=N, 5).  
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **A, C, E, O, P, R, T**.  
- Available letters (not yet tested or confirmed): **B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
- Since the word must contain at least one vowel (besides I), and **A, E, O** are excluded, the remaining vowel possibilities are **U** or **Y** (or rarely, **W** as part of a diphthong).  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- **Goal:** Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, L, D) and the vowel **Y** (to cover vowel possibilities).  
- **Pattern constraint:** Must be `_ _ I N _`.  
- **Avoid:** Repeating excluded letters or known letters unnecessarily.  
- **Ideal word:** Uses distinct, untested letters to maximize information.  

### Why ""shiny""?
- **Fits the pattern:** `S H I N Y` → Positions 3 and 4 are fixed as **I** and **N**.  
- **Tests key letters:**  
  - **S** (high-frequency consonant, position 1).  
  - **H** (common consonant, position 2).  
  - **Y** (vowel candidate, position 5; tests if the word has a second vowel).  
- **Avoids excluded letters:** No A, C, E, O, P, R, T.  
- **Distinct letters:** All letters are unique, testing three new positions (1, 2, 5) efficiently.  
- **Common word:** ""Shiny"" is a valid English word, reducing the risk of invalid guesses.  

If ""shiny"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal:  
- Whether **S** is in the word (and if so, its position).  
- Whether **H** is in the word (and if so, its position).  
- Whether **Y** is in the word (and if so, its position).  

This will significantly narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>shiny</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: shiny -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) Y(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the third guess ""shiny"":
- S: x -> not in the word
- H: x -> not in the word
- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter)
- Y: - -> in the word but in the wrong position

So, from this feedback:
- The secret word has the letter 'Y' but not at position 5 (since it's marked as ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).
- The letters S and H are not in the word.

Now, combining with previous feedback:

Excluded letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T, S, H (from guesses 1, 2, and 3)

Confirmed positions:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N

And we know the word has Y, but not at position 5.

Since Y is in the word but not at position 5, and the only positions left are 1, 2, and 5, but position 5 is not Y, so Y must be at position 1 or 2.

Pattern: _ _ I N _

We know Y is in the word and must be at position 1 or 2.

Also, the word does not contain: A, C, E, H, O, P, R, S, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but Y is already known to be in the word, so we can use it, but we need to place it at position 1 or 2).

We must form a word that has Y at position 1 or 2, and I at 3, N at 4, and the fifth letter is unknown.

Also, the word must not contain the excluded letters.

Now, for the fourth guess, we need to test possibilities for the remaining positions.

We know Y is at 1 or 2. We can try to fix Y at position 1 and see what words are possible, or at position 2.

But we need to make a guess that will help us distinguish.

We should also test other common letters for the remaining positions.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and constraints.

First, if Y is at position 1:
- Pattern: Y _ I N _
- The second letter can be one of the available letters, and the fifth letter one of the available letters, but not excluded.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Similarly, if Y is at position 2:
- Pattern: _ Y I N _

Now, we need to choose a guess that can test both possibilities? Or we can commit to one and see.

But we have three positions to determine: 1, 2, and 5, but with Y being at 1 or 2, so if we fix Y at one position, we can test the other.

We can also choose a word that has Y at position 1 and then test common letters for 2 and 5, or vice versa.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6).

We should try to cover as many letters as possible.

Since Y is the only vowel we know besides I, and we have to have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but the word might have U or other.

But we have Y, so that's covered.

Now, let's think of words that fit.

First, with Y at position 1: Y _ I N _

Possible words:
- ""YOGIN"": but O is excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUKIN"": not a word? 
- ""YULIN"": not a common word? 
- ""YAPON"": A and O excluded -> invalid.
- ""YAWIN"": A excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUCKY"": but C and K? C is excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUCKS"": C and S excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUGAS"": S excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUKKY"": K and Y repeated? But K is allowed? But ""YUKKY"" is not a word? 
- ""YULAN"": A excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUPON"": O and P excluded -> invalid.

It's hard to find words with Y at 1 and then a vowel? But we have U available.

""YUMMY"": M and Y repeated? But ""YUMMY"" has Y at 1 and 5, and U at 2? Pattern: Y U M M Y -> but position 3 is M, but we need I at 3? No, position 3 must be I, so ""YUMMY"" doesn't have I at 3.

We need the third letter to be I.

So, for Y at 1: Y ? I N ?

The second letter must be a consonant or vowel that can form a word.

Possible words:
- ""YDI?"": not a word.
- ""YF?"": not.

Actually, I can't think of many. Let me list valid English words.

Common words: 
- ""BEGIN"": but B E G I N -> E is excluded -> invalid.
- ""BLUIN"": not a word.

Perhaps ""LYING"": but we already guessed ""shiny"", and ""lying"" has Y at position 2? Not at 1.

With Y at 1, I think ""YOWIE"": but O and E excluded -> invalid.

""YUKON"": O excluded -> invalid.

""YUPON"": O and P excluded.

It seems difficult. Maybe Y at position 1 is not common.

Now, with Y at position 2: _ Y I N _

Pattern: ? Y I N ?

This is more promising.

For example:
- ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> this is a word. And D, G are not excluded? D and G are allowed.
- ""FLYING"": F L Y I N G -> but that's 6 letters? No, ""FLYING"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.
- ""TYING"": T excluded -> invalid.
- ""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L, Y, I, N, G -> L and G allowed? Yes. And we haven't tested L or G.
- ""VYING"": V Y I N G -> V is allowed? Yes. V, Y, I, N, G.
- ""MYTHS"": but T and H excluded -> invalid.
- ""GYPSY"": P and S excluded -> invalid.
- ""BYLAW"": but A and W? A excluded -> invalid.
- ""CYTON"": C excluded -> invalid.
- ""GYNIC"": C excluded -> invalid.
- ""SYNOD"": S and O excluded -> invalid.

So the common words with Y at position 2 and I at 3: ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

We also have ""PYLON"", but P and O excluded.

""HYMNS"": H excluded -> invalid.

So the candidates are: ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

Now, we also have the fifth letter to consider.

In ""DYING"": fifth letter is G.
In ""LYING"": fifth letter is G.
In ""VYING"": fifth letter is G.

All end with G? Not necessarily, but in these words they do.

Are there others? ""MYN?"": not a word.

""WYNDS"": but S excluded -> invalid.

""XYST?"": not common.

So the main candidates are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

We need to choose one to guess.

But note: we also have to consider that the fifth letter might not be G? But in the pattern, it could be something else.

For example, is there a word like ""XYLIC""? But C excluded and X Y L I C -> position 3 is L, not I? No.

Or ""BYSSI"": S excluded and not I at 3.

I think ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"" are the main ones.

But we know Y is in the word and not at position 5, so in these words, Y is at position 2, which is consistent.

Now, for the guess, we can choose one of these to test.

But if we guess one of them and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback.

But we need to maximize information.

We have not tested D, L, V, or G yet.

G is common, so if we guess one of these, we test G at position 5.

But if we guess ""DYING"", we test D at 1 and G at 5.

Similarly, ""LYING"" tests L at 1 and G at 5.

""VYING"" tests V at 1 and G at 5.

V is less common than D or L.

So we should choose between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"".

D and L are both common.

We can choose ""LYING"" because L is slightly more common than D? Or D?

Letter frequency: L is more common than D (L is 11th, D is 10th? Actually, D is 9th, L is 10th? Close).

But we can also consider that we might get information about the first letter.

Another thing: we know that the word has Y, so if we guess a word with Y at position 2, and if it's correct, we get confirmation.

But we already know Y is in the word, so the feedback will tell us if Y is at position 2 or not? Not exactly, because if we put Y at position 2 and it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get - or x? But we know Y is in the word, so if we put it at position 2 and it's not there, we still get - meaning it's elsewhere, but we know it must be at position 1 or 2, so if it's not at 2, it must be at 1.

Similarly, if we put it at 1 and it's not there, it must be at 2.

So we can use the guess to pin down the position of Y.

But in this case, for the fourth guess, we can choose to put Y at position 1 or 2.

But earlier we saw that words with Y at 1 are rare, so it's more likely at 2.

Therefore, we can guess one of ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

I think ""LYING"" is a good choice because L is common.

But we already have feedback that S and H are not in the word, so no issue.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has Y at position 1 to test that possibility, but it might be hard to find.

For example, is there a word like ""YINCE""? Not a word.

""YITIE""? Not.

""YLIKE""? Not.

I think it's safer to assume Y is at position 2.

So let's choose between ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

""VYING"" has V, which is less common, so we might avoid that.

Between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"", both are valid.

We can choose ""LYING"" because it uses L, which we haven't tested.

But we haven't tested D either.

We can also consider that in ""LYING"", if we guess it, and it's not correct, we get feedback on L and G.

Similarly for ""DYING"".

But note: we have to consider the fifth letter. In all these, it's G, so if G is not in the word, we know that none of these are the word, and Y must be at position 1? But we don't have a word for that.

But if G is not in the word, then we know the fifth letter is not G, and Y must be at position 1, and we need to find a word with Y at 1 and I at 3, N at 4, and a fifth letter.

But as we saw, such words are rare, so it might be that G is in the word.

We can also choose a word that has Y at position 1 to directly test that.

For example, is there a valid word with Y at 1? Let's search.

""YCLAD"": C excluded -> invalid.

""YDRAD"": not a word.

""YFERE"": E excluded -> invalid.

""YIKES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.

""YIRTH"": H excluded -> invalid.

""YLIKE"": not a word.

""YMOLT"": O excluded -> invalid.

""YMPES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.

""YOGIN"": O excluded -> invalid.

""YOKED"": O, E, D? O and E excluded -> invalid.

""YONIC"": O and C excluded -> invalid.

""YORES"": O, E, S excluded -> invalid.

""YOUKS"": O, U, K, S? O excluded -> invalid.

""YOURS"": O, U, R, S excluded -> invalid.

""YOWES"": O, E, S excluded -> invalid.

""YOWIE"": O, E, I? O and E excluded -> invalid.

""YRApt"": not a word.

""YRENT"": E excluded -> invalid.

""YRIVD"": not a word.

""YRNEH"": not a word.

""YSLUM"": S excluded -> invalid.

""YTOST"": O and T excluded -> invalid.

""YUANS"": A, U, S excluded -> invalid.

""YUCCH"": C and H excluded -> invalid.

""YUCKY"": C and K? C excluded -> invalid.

""YUGAS"": S excluded -> invalid.

""YUKKY"": K excluded? K is allowed, but ""YUKKY"" is not a standard word? It might be slang, but let's avoid.

""YULES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.

""YUMMY"": M and Y repeated, and no I at 3 -> invalid.

""YURTA"": U, R, T, A? A, R, T excluded -> invalid.

I cannot find a valid 5-letter word with Y at position 1, I at 3, N at 4, and without excluded letters.

Therefore, it is highly likely that Y is at position 2.

So the word must be of the form _ Y I N _

And the candidates are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"", and possibly others with different fifth letters.

But earlier I thought of only those three, but is there a word with a different fifth letter?

For example, ""MYTHI"": H and T excluded -> invalid.

""SYNCH"": S and H excluded -> invalid.

""WYNDS"": S excluded -> invalid.

""XYLIC"": C excluded -> invalid.

""BYNIN"": not a word.

""KYLIN"": K Y L I N -> but that's K at 1, Y at 2, L at 3? But we need I at 3, not L. ""KYLIN"" has I at position 4? K(1), Y(2), L(3), I(4), N(5) -> but we need I at 3 and N at 4, so position 4 is I, not N. So no.

""PYINS"": P and S excluded -> invalid.

""TYI?"": T excluded.

""ZYMIN"": M I N? Z Y M I N -> Z(1), Y(2), M(3), I(4), N(5) -> again, I at 4, not 3.

So no, the only common words are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

Therefore, we should guess one of these.

Now, to choose, we can pick ""LYING"" because L is more common than D or V? L is more common than V, but D and L are close.

Since we have three options, and we need to test, we can choose the most common one.

""LYING"" is a very common word.

We can also consider that if we guess ""LYING"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on L and G.

Similarly for others.

But let's see the frequency: ""LYING"" is more common than ""DYING"" or ""VYING"".

""DYING"" is also common.

But ""VYING"" is less common.

So between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"", I'll choose ""LYING"".

So the guess is ""LYING"".

But note: in ""LYING"", the letters are L, Y, I, N, G.

We know I and N are correct and in place.

Y is in the word but we are testing it at position 2.

L is at position 1, G at position 5.

If the word is ""LYING"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on L and G.

If L is not in the word, then we know the first letter must be D or V (from the candidates).

Similarly, if G is not in the word, then none of the candidates are valid, but we know Y must be at position 2, so the fifth letter must be something else, but we don't have a candidate, so it might be a rare word.

But let's hope it's one of the common ones.

So I'll go with ""LYING"".

<guess>lying</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - **C, R, A, E** are not in the word.  
- **Guess 2: ""point""** → Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - **N** is confirmed again at position 4.  
  - **P, O, T** are not in the word.  
- **Guess 3: ""shiny""** → Feedback: S(x), H(x), I(✓), N(✓), Y(-)  
  - **I** and **N** are confirmed at positions 3 and 4.  
  - **S** and **H** are not in the word.  
  - **Y** is in the word but not at position 5.  

### Deductions:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ I N _` (positions: 1, 2, 3=I, 4=N, 5).  
- **Excluded letters** (not in the word): A, C, E, H, O, P, R, S, T.  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: I, N, Y.  
  - **Y** must be at position 1 or 2 (since it is in the word but not at position 5).  
- **Available letters** (not tested or confirmed): B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Key constraints**:  
  - Position 1: Must be one of B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but Y could be here).  
  - Position 2: Must be Y or another available letter (but Y must be at position 1 or 2).  
  - Position 5: Must be one of the available letters.  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test the position of **Y** (position 1 or 2) and cover common consonants for the remaining positions.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Since **Y** must be at position 1 or 2, and no valid 5-letter words exist with **Y** at position 1 (based on pattern `Y _ I N _` and excluded letters), **Y** is likely at position 2.  
  - Focus on words with the pattern `_ Y I N _` to test this.  
  - Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, D, G) for positions 1 and 5 to maximize information.  
- **Word choice**: ""lying"" fits perfectly:  
  - Pattern: `L Y I N G` → Tests **L** at position 1, **Y** at position 2, and **G** at position 5.  
  - Uses distinct, untested letters (L, G) and confirms **Y** placement.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  
- **Why not other candidates?**  
  - ""dying"" and ""vying"" are alternatives, but ""lying"" uses **L** (more common than **D** or **V**) and is a high-frequency word.  
  - If ""lying"" is incorrect, feedback on **L** and **G** will quickly narrow possibilities (e.g., if **L** is absent, position 1 must be **D** or **V**; if **G** is absent, position 5 is another letter).

Uses other common letters to gather more information.\n\nPossible words with \'N\' at position 4? Let\'s think of 5-letter words ending with ...N? Actually position 4 is the fourth letter. So the pattern is: ? ? ? N ?\n\nSince the word must have an \'N\' at position 4, and must avoid C, R, A, E.\n\nWe can consider words like:\n- WINDY, but let\'s check: W I N D Y -> N at pos 3? Wait, no: positions in a 5-letter word: \n  Position 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?\n\nIn ""windy"": \n  Pos1: W, Pos2: I, Pos3: N, Pos4: D, Pos5: Y -> doesn\'t have N at 4.\n\nWe need words where the fourth letter is N. Examples:\n- ""BLANK"": letters B, L, A, N, K -> but A is already excluded (feedback said A not in word), so cannot use A.\n- ""CLINK"": has C -> excluded.\n- ""SKUNK"": but has K at position 5? And U? Also, we don\'t know about K yet. But S? We don\'t know. But we cannot use C,R,A,E. So S is allowed? Let\'s list words.\n\nActually, common words with N at position 4:\n- ""POINT"": P O I N T -> has I and O? But we don\'t know about O or I or T.\n- ""JOINT"": J O I N T -> similar.\n- ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> O and U? \n- ""DAUNT"": D A U N T -> but A is excluded (we know A is not in the word).\n- ""COUNT"": C O U N T -> has C -> excluded.\n\nWe must avoid A, C, E, R.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""BOUND"": B O U N D -> no A,C,E,R? But O and U are unknown. Also, D at the end.\n- ""FOUND"": F O U N D -> same, but F?\n- ""POUND"": same.\n- ""WOUND"": W O U N D -> same.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t used the fact that we can test other common letters.\n\nAlso, words without the forbidden letters: so we can use B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (except A, C, E, R).\n\nWe want to maximize information. So we should use letters that are frequently used, and avoid repeating letters we already know are absent.\n\nAnother word: ""SHOWN"": S H O W N -> positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4)? Wait, in ""shown"", the fourth letter is W? Then fifth is N? No, ""SHOWN"" has 5 letters: S-H-O-W-N? Actually, no: it\'s S-H-O-W-N? Wait, let me check.\n\nActually, ""SHOWN"" is S-H-O-W-N? That would be S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). We need N at position 4? Here N is at position 5. So incorrect.\n\nWe need a word with the fourth letter as N. So the word pattern: _ _ _ N _\n\nLet me try to think of words: \n- ""BLUNT"": B L U N T -> fourth letter is N. And letters: B,L,U,T -> none of A,C,E,R? Yes. So it\'s a candidate.\n- ""GRUNT"": G R U N T -> but R is excluded? R is not allowed because feedback said R(x) -> not in the word. So no R.\n- ""STUNG"": S T U N G -> positions: S(1),T(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) -> has N at position 4. Letters: S,T,U,G -> none forbidden.\n\nSo ""STUNG"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""SWUNG"": S W U N G -> same, but with W.\n\nAlso, ""DOING"": D O I N G -> position: D(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> that fits. Letters: D,O,I,G -> none forbidden.\n\nBut note: in ""DOING"", the word has \'O\',\'I\',\'G\', and we don\'t know about them.\n\nAnother: ""GOING"": G O I N G -> same as above, but starts with G.\n\nWe should choose a word that has as many new letters as possible and avoids the known absent ones.\n\nMy goal is to cover common vowels and consonants. We haven\'t tested: O, I, U, and consonants like S, T, L, D, etc.\n\nI am considering ""STUNG"": \n- It has S, T, U, N, G -> N is fixed at position 4. We avoid forbidden letters.\n\nBut note: ""STUNG"" has the letter U, which is a vowel, and S,T,G are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""BLIND"": but position? B L I N D -> N is at position 4? B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). Okay. But we cannot use BLIND? Because it has I? But we don\'t know. And letters: B, L, I, N, D -> none forbidden.\n\nHowever, we already know N is at position 4, so we can fix that.\n\nBut wait, in ""BLIND"", the word has \'I\' and \'D\'. We have to see which gives more coverage.\n\nI could also consider ""POINT"" but it has O and I? But note: ""POINT"" is P O I N T -> N at position 4? P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.\n\nBut we don\'t know about O, I, P, T.\n\nWe want to avoid previously excluded letters? Only A,C,E,R are excluded.\n\nSo POINT is valid? Letters: P, O, I, N, T -> no A,C,E,R.\n\nSimilarly, JOINT, but J is less common.\n\nAnother word: ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> letters M, O, U, N, T -> no forbidden.\n\nBut U is in there.\n\nI think either ""POINT"", ""STUNG"", or ""BLUNT"" would be good.\n\nBut note: we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4). We need to test other positions.\n\nI am leaning toward ""POINT"" because it has common letters: P, O, I, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""STUNG"" has S,T,U,N,G.\n\nBut since N is fixed at 4, in ""POINT"" we have:\n- Position 1: P\n- Position 2: O\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: N (known)\n- Position 5: T\n\nThat gives us information about positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nSimilarly, ""STUNG"": \n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: T\n- Position 3: U\n- Position 4: N\n- Position 5: G\n\nWe haven\'t tested S, T, U, G.\n\nBut ""POINT"" includes the vowels O and I, which might be more informative.\n\nI recall that in Wordle strategy, we often want to cover vowels. In our first guess ""crane"", we tested A and E, both excluded. So the word must have other vowels: I,O,U or sometimes Y.\n\nTherefore, testing O and I in ""POINT"" might be good.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has O or I. It could have U or something.\n\nBut for maximizing information, let\'s go with ""POINT"".\n\nAnother idea: since we know N at position 4, and we know the word doesn\'t have A,C,E,R, we might choose a word that uses the letter S? S is very common.\n\nBut ""POINT"" has no S.\n\nAlternatively, we could do ""STINT"": S T I N T -> but then T is at positions 2 and 5? That would be S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But T at position 2 and 5? That\'s using T twice. Not good because we are wasting a slot on a repeated letter.\n\nBetter to use distinct letters.\n\nSo, ""POINT"" has distinct letters: P,O,I,N,T -> that\'s good.\n\nSimilarly, ""STUNG"" has distinct: S,T,U,N,G -> distinct.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let\'s make sure: can we use ""POINT""? Yes.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""POINT"".\n\nTherefore, the second guess is ""POINT"".\n\nFormat: <guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where:\n- C, R, A, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"")\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, marked with ""✓"")\n\nThe secret word:\n- Must have ""N"" as the 4th letter\n- Must not contain C, R, A, or E\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""POINT"" because:\n- It places ""N"" in the 4th position as required\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)\n- It introduces new, common letters: P, O, I, T\n- These letters cover vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T) to maximize information\n- All letters are distinct to test more possibilities\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the second guess ""point"":\n- P: x -> not in the word\n- O: x -> not in the word\n- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, since in ""point"", I is the third letter)\n- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, as before)\n- T: x -> not in the word\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, T (from both guesses).\n\nAdditionally, we know the word must be of the form: _ _ I N _\n\nWe need to avoid the letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use I and N, but they are already placed).\n\nWe must form a 5-letter word with the pattern _ _ I N _.\n\nWe should choose a word that uses common letters from the available set to maximize information.\n\nCommon letters to consider: S, U, L, D, M, H, G, B, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern and use only the available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BLINK"": B L I N K -> but we have B, L, I, N, K.

So yes.\n\n- ""SLING"": S L I N G -> S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, L, G are allowed.\n\n- ""STING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""SWING"": S W I N G -> S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, W, G allowed.\n\n- ""BRING"": B R I N G -> but R is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""THING"": T is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> D(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). D, Y, G allowed.\n\n- ""FLINT"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""BLIND"": B L I N D -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). B, L, D allowed.\n\n- ""BLIMP"": but P is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""GLINT"": T forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""QUINT"": Q U I N T -> T forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n- ""JUIN?"": not a word.\n\nWe have several candidates: ""BLINK"", ""FLING"", ""SLING"", ""SWING"", ""DYING"", ""BLIND"".\n\nWe want to choose one that uses letters we haven\'t tested yet and are common.\n\nWe haven\'t tested: S, B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.\n\nIn ""BLINK"": tests B, L, K (and I and N are known).\nIn ""FLING"": tests F, L, G.\nIn ""SLING"": tests S, L, G.\nIn ""SWING"": tests S, W, G.\nIn ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G.\nIn ""BLIND"": tests B, L, D.\n\nWe know I and N are fixed, so we are only testing the first, second, and fifth letters.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that might be less common? But we need to cover as many possibilities.\n\nNote: We have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.\n\nI think ""SLING"" is a good candidate because S and L are very common letters.\n\nAlternatively, ""SWING"" has W, which is less common, so maybe not.\n\n""BLINK"" has K, which is also common.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHINY"": but position? S H I N Y -> I is at position 3? S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes. And letters: S, H, Y -> allowed? H and Y are not forbidden. So ""SHINY"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""WHINY"": W H I N Y -> same, W and H.\n\nBut we don\'t know about H.\n\nAnother: ""SKIN?"": but we need 5 letters. ""SKINS"" is 5 letters but ends with S? Pattern is _ _ I N _, so fifth letter must be something. ""SKINS"" is S K I N S -> but that has I at position 3? S(1), K(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But S is repeated? And we don\'t know if S is in the word. But it\'s allowed? The word must have the pattern, and S is at position 1 and 5. But we are testing, so it\'s okay? However, repeating S might not be efficient because if S is in the word, we might not know where. But since we are testing position 1 and 5, it could be useful? Actually, if S is in the word, we get feedback for both positions. But it\'s not ideal for information.\n\nSo better to avoid repeats.\n\nTherefore, ""SKINS"" is not great because of the repeated S.\n\nStick with distinct letters.\n\nAnother word: ""BUILD"": but I is at position 3? B U I L D -> B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> but we need N at position 4, not L. So no.\n\nWe must have I at 3 and N at 4.\n\nSo the word must be: ? ? I N ?\n\nI think ""SLING"" is a good choice: common letters S, L, G.\n\n""FLING"" is also good: F, L, G.\n\nBut F is less common than S? S is more common.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLIND"" has B, L, D.\n\nI think S is the most common consonant, so let\'s go with a word that has S.\n\n""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> I and N known, so testing S, L, G.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHINS"": but repeated S? S H I N S -> repeated S and we don\'t know if S is in the word. Not ideal.\n\n""SHINE"": but E is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> distinct letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N known, so testing S, H, Y.\n\nH and Y are less common? But we have to test them.\n\nI think ""SLING"" is better because L is more common than H.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SMITH"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n""SPRIG"": P and R forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n""SWING"": S W I N G -> testing S, W, G. W is less common.\n\n""BLINK"": B L I N K -> testing B, L, K. B and K are common.\n\nBut S is more common than B? In English, S is the most common letter at the end, but we are at the beginning.\n\nSince we are testing the first, second, and fifth letters, we should cover common letters for those positions.\n\nFor position 1: common letters: S, B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, etc.\nFor position 2: vowels or common consonants? But we don\'t have many vowels left: we have U and Y (and sometimes W, Y as vowels). We already know A, E, I, O are not in the word? We know A, E, O are not in the word, but I is in the word at position 3. So the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, because it could have U or Y.\n\nBut in 5-letter words, there is usually at least two vowels? Not always, but often.\n\nWe have I as one vowel. It might have U or Y.\n\nIn ""SLING"": the vowels are I only? L, G are consonants. So it has only one vowel? But that\'s possible, e.g., ""lynch"", but we have I.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLINK"" has I and that\'s it? B, L, I, N, K -> only I as vowel? But that might be acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s check: ""lynch"" has Y as vowel. In ""BLINK"", I is the only vowel, which is acceptable.\n\nBut we might want to test a vowel? We have U and Y available.\n\nIn ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> Y is a vowel? So it has two vowels: Y and I. That might be good because we can check if Y is in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHINY"" has I and Y.\n\nSo ""DYING"" or ""SHINY"" might be better to test a vowel.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has a vowel at position 2 or 5? It could.\n\nGiven that we have only one vowel (I) so far, and the word might have another vowel (U or Y), it would be good to test one of them.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G. Y is a vowel.\n\n""SHINY"": tests S, H, Y. Also Y.\n\n""JUINY"" not a word.\n\n""BUYIN"" not a word.\n\n""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: L, Y, G -> allowed. And it has Y as a vowel.\n\nSo ""LYING"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""TYING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\nSo we have ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""SHINY"".\n\nNow, among these, which one to choose?\n\n""DYING"": D, Y, G\n""LYING"": L, Y, G\n""SHINY"": S, H, Y\n\nWe want to test common letters. S is more common than D or L? S is very common.\n\nBut H is less common.\n\nAlso, we are testing Y in all.\n\nI think ""SHINY"" is good because it tests S and H, and Y.\n\nBut ""LYING"" tests L and Y, G.\n\nG is common.\n\nBut S is the most common, so let\'s go with ""SHINY"" to test S and H.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""SLING"" to test S and L, but without a vowel.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might not have Y, so testing Y might not be necessary.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so it\'s better to test a vowel if possible.\n\nSince we are at the third guess, and we have three positions to test (1,2,5), we can test one vowel and two consonants.\n\nIn ""SHINY"", we test S (consonant), H (consonant), Y (vowel). That\'s a good mix.\n\nIn ""LYING"", we test L (consonant), Y (vowel), G (consonant). Also good.\n\nBut S is more common than L, so ""SHINY"" might be better? But H is less common than G? H is more common than G? Let me think.\n\nIn English, the frequency of letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... So S is 7th, H is 8th, L is 11th, G is 16th, Y is 20th, etc.\n\nSo S and H are both in the top 10.\n\nIn ""SHINY"", we test S and H, which are high frequency, and Y which is less common but a vowel.\n\nIn ""LYING"", we test L (11th), Y (20th), G (16th) — lower frequency.\n\nSo ""SHINY"" seems better for covering common letters.\n\nAlso, ""SHINY"" is a common word.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""SHINY"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: S H I N Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I (correct), 4:N (correct), 5:Y.\n\nAnd letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N are known, so we are testing S, H, Y.\n\nAnd no forbidden letters.\n\nSo guess: ""SHINY""\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that Y is allowed at the end. Yes, it is.\n\nSo I think that\'s a good guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose ""SLING"" to avoid the less common Y? But then we don\'t test a vowel.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""SLING"", and it turns out the word has Y, we might not find it.\n\nBut we have to make a choice.\n\nI think testing a vowel is important, so ""SHINY"" is better.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SWING"" has W, which is less common than H? W is 15th, H is 8th, so H is better.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SHINY"".\n\n<guess>shiny</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  \n  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.  \n  - **C, R, A, E** are not in the word.  \n- **Guess 2: ""point""** → Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  \n  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  \n  - **N** is confirmed again at position 4.  \n  - **P, O, T** are not in the word.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I N _` (positions: 1, 2, 3=I, 4=N, 5).  \n- Excluded letters (not in the word): **A, C, E, O, P, R, T**.  \n- Available letters (not yet tested or confirmed): **B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  \n- Since the word must contain at least one vowel (besides I), and **A, E, O** are excluded, the remaining vowel possibilities are **U** or **Y** (or rarely, **W** as part of a diphthong).  \n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n- **Goal:** Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, L, D) and the vowel **Y** (to cover vowel possibilities).  \n- **Pattern constraint:** Must be `_ _ I N _`.  \n- **Avoid:** Repeating excluded letters or known letters unnecessarily.  \n- **Ideal word:** Uses distinct, untested letters to maximize information.  \n\n### Why ""shiny""?\n- **Fits the pattern:** `S H I N Y` → Positions 3 and 4 are fixed as **I** and **N**.  \n- **Tests key letters:**  \n  - **S** (high-frequency consonant, position 1).  \n  - **H** (common consonant, position 2).  \n  - **Y** (vowel candidate, position 5; tests if the word has a second vowel).  \n- **Avoids excluded letters:** No A, C, E, O, P, R, T.  \n- **Distinct letters:** All letters are unique, testing three new positions (1, 2, 5) efficiently.  \n- **Common word:** ""Shiny"" is a valid English word, reducing the risk of invalid guesses.  \n\nIf ""shiny"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal:  \n- Whether **S** is in the word (and if so, its position).  \n- Whether **H** is in the word (and if so, its position).  \n- Whether **Y** is in the word (and if so, its position).  \n\nThis will significantly narrow down possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>shiny</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: shiny -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) Y(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the third guess ""shiny"":\n- S: x -> not in the word\n- H: x -> not in the word\n- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)\n- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter)\n- Y: - -> in the word but in the wrong position\n\nSo, from this feedback:\n- The secret word has the letter \'Y\' but not at position 5 (since it\'s marked as ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).\n- The letters S and H are not in the word.\n\nNow, combining with previous feedback:\n\nExcluded letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T, S, H (from guesses 1, 2, and 3)\n\nConfirmed positions:\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: N\n\nAnd we know the word has Y, but not at position 5.\n\nSince Y is in the word but not at position 5, and the only positions left are 1, 2, and 5, but position 5 is not Y, so Y must be at position 1 or 2.\n\nPattern: _ _ I N _\n\nWe know Y is in the word and must be at position 1 or 2.\n\nAlso, the word does not contain: A, C, E, H, O, P, R, S, T.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but Y is already known to be in the word, so we can use it, but we need to place it at position 1 or 2).\n\nWe must form a word that has Y at position 1 or 2, and I at 3, N at 4, and the fifth letter is unknown.\n\nAlso, the word must not contain the excluded letters.\n\nNow, for the fourth guess, we need to test possibilities for the remaining positions.\n\nWe know Y is at 1 or 2. We can try to fix Y at position 1 and see what words are possible, or at position 2.\n\nBut we need to make a guess that will help us distinguish.\n\nWe should also test other common letters for the remaining positions.\n\nLet\'s list possible words that fit the pattern and constraints.\n\nFirst, if Y is at position 1:\n- Pattern: Y _ I N _\n- The second letter can be one of the available letters, and the fifth letter one of the available letters, but not excluded.\n\nBut we have to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nSimilarly, if Y is at position 2:\n- Pattern: _ Y I N _\n\nNow, we need to choose a guess that can test both possibilities? Or we can commit to one and see.\n\nBut we have three positions to determine: 1, 2, and 5, but with Y being at 1 or 2, so if we fix Y at one position, we can test the other.\n\nWe can also choose a word that has Y at position 1 and then test common letters for 2 and 5, or vice versa.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6).\n\nWe should try to cover as many letters as possible.\n\nSince Y is the only vowel we know besides I, and we have to have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but the word might have U or other.\n\nBut we have Y, so that\'s covered.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that fit.\n\nFirst, with Y at position 1: Y _ I N _\n\nPossible words:\n- ""YOGIN"": but O is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YUKIN"": not a word? \n- ""YULIN"": not a common word? \n- ""YAPON"": A and O excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YAWIN"": A excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YUCKY"": but C and K? C is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YUCKS"": C and S excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YUGAS"": S excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YUKKY"": K and Y repeated? But K is allowed? But ""YUKKY"" is not a word? \n- ""YULAN"": A excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YUPON"": O and P excluded -> invalid.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words with Y at 1 and then a vowel? But we have U available.\n\n""YUMMY"": M and Y repeated? But ""YUMMY"" has Y at 1 and 5, and U at 2? Pattern: Y U M M Y -> but position 3 is M, but we need I at 3? No, position 3 must be I, so ""YUMMY"" doesn\'t have I at 3.\n\nWe need the third letter to be I.\n\nSo, for Y at 1: Y ? I N ?\n\nThe second letter must be a consonant or vowel that can form a word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""YDI?"": not a word.\n- ""YF?"": not.\n\nActually, I can\'t think of many. Let me list valid English words.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""BEGIN"": but B E G I N -> E is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""BLUIN"": not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""LYING"": but we already guessed ""shiny"", and ""lying"" has Y at position 2? Not at 1.\n\nWith Y at 1, I think ""YOWIE"": but O and E excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUKON"": O excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUPON"": O and P excluded.\n\nIt seems difficult. Maybe Y at position 1 is not common.\n\nNow, with Y at position 2: _ Y I N _\n\nPattern: ? Y I N ?\n\nThis is more promising.\n\nFor example:\n- ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> this is a word. And D, G are not excluded? D and G are allowed.\n- ""FLYING"": F L Y I N G -> but that\'s 6 letters? No, ""FLYING"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.\n- ""TYING"": T excluded -> invalid.\n- ""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L, Y, I, N, G -> L and G allowed? Yes. And we haven\'t tested L or G.\n- ""VYING"": V Y I N G -> V is allowed? Yes. V, Y, I, N, G.\n- ""MYTHS"": but T and H excluded -> invalid.\n- ""GYPSY"": P and S excluded -> invalid.\n- ""BYLAW"": but A and W? A excluded -> invalid.\n- ""CYTON"": C excluded -> invalid.\n- ""GYNIC"": C excluded -> invalid.\n- ""SYNOD"": S and O excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo the common words with Y at position 2 and I at 3: ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".\n\nWe also have ""PYLON"", but P and O excluded.\n\n""HYMNS"": H excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo the candidates are: ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".\n\nNow, we also have the fifth letter to consider.\n\nIn ""DYING"": fifth letter is G.\nIn ""LYING"": fifth letter is G.\nIn ""VYING"": fifth letter is G.\n\nAll end with G? Not necessarily, but in these words they do.\n\nAre there others? ""MYN?"": not a word.\n\n""WYNDS"": but S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""XYST?"": not common.\n\nSo the main candidates are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".\n\nWe need to choose one to guess.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the fifth letter might not be G? But in the pattern, it could be something else.\n\nFor example, is there a word like ""XYLIC""? But C excluded and X Y L I C -> position 3 is L, not I? No.\n\nOr ""BYSSI"": S excluded and not I at 3.\n\nI think ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"" are the main ones.\n\nBut we know Y is in the word and not at position 5, so in these words, Y is at position 2, which is consistent.\n\nNow, for the guess, we can choose one of these to test.\n\nBut if we guess one of them and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback.\n\nBut we need to maximize information.\n\nWe have not tested D, L, V, or G yet.\n\nG is common, so if we guess one of these, we test G at position 5.\n\nBut if we guess ""DYING"", we test D at 1 and G at 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""LYING"" tests L at 1 and G at 5.\n\n""VYING"" tests V at 1 and G at 5.\n\nV is less common than D or L.\n\nSo we should choose between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"".\n\nD and L are both common.\n\nWe can choose ""LYING"" because L is slightly more common than D? Or D?\n\nLetter frequency: L is more common than D (L is 11th, D is 10th? Actually, D is 9th, L is 10th? Close).\n\nBut we can also consider that we might get information about the first letter.\n\nAnother thing: we know that the word has Y, so if we guess a word with Y at position 2, and if it\'s correct, we get confirmation.\n\nBut we already know Y is in the word, so the feedback will tell us if Y is at position 2 or not? Not exactly, because if we put Y at position 2 and it\'s correct, we get ✓, if not, we get - or x? But we know Y is in the word, so if we put it at position 2 and it\'s not there, we still get - meaning it\'s elsewhere, but we know it must be at position 1 or 2, so if it\'s not at 2, it must be at 1.\n\nSimilarly, if we put it at 1 and it\'s not there, it must be at 2.\n\nSo we can use the guess to pin down the position of Y.\n\nBut in this case, for the fourth guess, we can choose to put Y at position 1 or 2.\n\nBut earlier we saw that words with Y at 1 are rare, so it\'s more likely at 2.\n\nTherefore, we can guess one of ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".\n\nI think ""LYING"" is a good choice because L is common.\n\nBut we already have feedback that S and H are not in the word, so no issue.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has Y at position 1 to test that possibility, but it might be hard to find.\n\nFor example, is there a word like ""YINCE""? Not a word.\n\n""YITIE""? Not.\n\n""YLIKE""? Not.\n\nI think it\'s safer to assume Y is at position 2.\n\nSo let\'s choose between ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".\n\n""VYING"" has V, which is less common, so we might avoid that.\n\nBetween ""DYING"" and ""LYING"", both are valid.\n\nWe can choose ""LYING"" because it uses L, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested D either.\n\nWe can also consider that in ""LYING"", if we guess it, and it\'s not correct, we get feedback on L and G.\n\nSimilarly for ""DYING"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider the fifth letter. In all these, it\'s G, so if G is not in the word, we know that none of these are the word, and Y must be at position 1? But we don\'t have a word for that.\n\nBut if G is not in the word, then we know the fifth letter is not G, and Y must be at position 1, and we need to find a word with Y at 1 and I at 3, N at 4, and a fifth letter.\n\nBut as we saw, such words are rare, so it might be that G is in the word.\n\nWe can also choose a word that has Y at position 1 to directly test that.\n\nFor example, is there a valid word with Y at 1? Let\'s search.\n\n""YCLAD"": C excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YDRAD"": not a word.\n\n""YFERE"": E excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YIKES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YIRTH"": H excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YLIKE"": not a word.\n\n""YMOLT"": O excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YMPES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YOGIN"": O excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YOKED"": O, E, D?

O excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YOURS"": O, U, R, S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YOWES"": O, E, S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YOWIE"": O, E, I? O and E excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YRApt"": not a word.\n\n""YRENT"": E excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YRIVD"": not a word.\n\n""YRNEH"": not a word.\n\n""YSLUM"": S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YTOST"": O and T excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUANS"": A, U, S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUCCH"": C and H excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUCKY"": C and K? C excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUGAS"": S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUKKY"": K excluded? K is allowed, but ""YUKKY"" is not a standard word? It might be slang, but let\'s avoid.\n\n""YULES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUMMY"": M and Y repeated, and no I at 3 -> invalid.\n\n""YURTA"": U, R, T, A? A, R, T excluded -> invalid.\n\nI cannot find a valid 5-letter word with Y at position 1, I at 3, N at 4, and without excluded letters.\n\nTherefore, it is highly likely that Y is at position 2.\n\nSo the word must be of the form _ Y I N _\n\nAnd the candidates are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"", and possibly others with different fifth letters.\n\nBut earlier I thought of only those three, but is there a word with a different fifth letter?\n\nFor example, ""MYTHI"": H and T excluded -> invalid.\n\n""SYNCH"": S and H excluded -> invalid.\n\n""WYNDS"": S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""XYLIC"": C excluded -> invalid.\n\n""BYNIN"": not a word.\n\n""KYLIN"": K Y L I N -> but that\'s K at 1, Y at 2, L at 3? But we need I at 3, not L. ""KYLIN"" has I at position 4? K(1), Y(2), L(3), I(4), N(5) -> but we need I at 3 and N at 4, so position 4 is I, not N.

So, summarizing the secret word:
- Position 2: Y
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G
- Only position 1 is unknown.

The word is: ? Y I N G

We know the first letter is missing, but we know which letters are excluded.

Excluded letters from previous feedback: A, C, E, H, O, P, R, T, S, L (from guesses 1 to 4). Specifically, from:
- Guess 1: C, R, A, E excluded
- Guess 2: P, O, T excluded
- Guess 3: S, H excluded
- Guess 4: L excluded

So excluded: A, C, E, H, L, O, P, R, S, T.

We need to find a letter for position 1 that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note:
- G is already at position 5, so it could be repeated? But we need a letter for position 1. However, G is allowed at position 1 unless excluded? But G is not excluded. Excluded are listed above.
- But we need to complete the word: ?YING

Common words ending with ""YING"": 
- ""DYING"": but D is available? Yes, but D is not excluded.
- ""EYING"": but E is excluded -> not possible.
- ""TYING"": T excluded -> not possible.
- ""HYING"": H excluded -> not possible.
- ""LYING"": we guessed it and L is excluded -> not possible.
- ""VYING"": V is available? Yes.

Also, other possibilities? 
- ""BYING"": is it a word? ""Buying"" is, but ""buying"" starts with B? Wait, ""BUYING""? But that would be B-U-Y-I-N-G? That's 6 letters? No, ""buying"" has 6 letters? Actually, ""buy"" is 3, ""buying"" is 6 letters. So not 5-letter.

We need 5-letter words.

The ending is ""YING"", and the word must be of the form X Y I N G.

Possible words:
- ""DYING"": D Y I N G
- ""VYING"": V Y I N G
- ""MYING""? Not a word.
- ""KYING""? Not a word.
- ""FYING""? Not a word.
- ""GYING"": G Y I N G -> but G repeated? And not a common word.

Valid English words: 
- ""Dying"" (to cease living)
- ""Vying"" (competing eagerly)

Also, ""Sying""? S excluded.

""Hying""? H excluded.

""Tying""? T excluded.

So only ""DYING"" and ""VYING"" are candidates.

We haven't tested D or V.

We are on the fifth guess. We have 2 guesses left.

We can guess either ""DYING"" or ""VYING"".

To maximize information? But we know if we guess one, and it's correct, we win. If not, the other must be correct.

Since we have two choices, we need to pick one.

We can guess ""DYING"" because D is more common than V? Or randomly.

Note: We don't have feedback on D or V.

But we can choose one, say ""DYING"".

Then, if it's not correct, we know it's ""VYING"".

So let's guess ""DYING"".

But note: we must avoid excluded letters: D is not excluded, so okay.

""EYING"": E excluded.

""PYING"": P excluded.

  - **N** confirmed at position 4.  
  - **C, R, A, E** excluded.  
- **Guess 2: ""point""** → Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - **I** confirmed at position 3, **N** reconfirmed at position 4.

### Deductions:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ Y I N G` (positions: 1, 2=Y, 3=I, 4=N, 5=G).  
- **Excluded letters**: A, C, E, H, L, O, P, R, S, T.  
- **Position 1 constraints**: Must be an untested letter (not excluded) that forms a valid English word. Remaining possibilities: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
  - **G** is at position 5 → Cannot repeat unless valid, but `GYING` is not a standard word.  
- **Valid candidates**: Only `DYING` (D at position 1) and `VYING` (V at position 1) fit the pattern and constraints.  

### Strategy for the Next Guess (Guess 5):
- **Goal**: Test one candidate (`DYING`) to resolve position 1, leveraging `D` as a high-frequency consonant. If incorrect, `VYING` must be the solution.  
- **Choice**: ""dying"" prioritizes `D` (more common than `V`) and resolves all uncertainty with one guess.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""ROAST"", etc. Let's choose one that has a good mix of common vowels and consonants.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has three common vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R, N). Also, it doesn't repeat any letters.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess:
- C: x -> not in the word
- R: x -> not in the word
- A: x -> not in the word
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, since positions are 1-indexed? Actually, in the example they showed the positions as given. But note: in ""crane"", the fourth letter is N, so N is in the secret word at position 4.

Since the feedback was for ""crane"": 
  C (x) -> not present
  R (x) -> not present
  A (x) -> not present
  N (✓) -> present and at position 4
  E (x) -> not present

Therefore, the secret word:
- Must have letter 'N' at position 4.
- Must NOT contain the letters C, R, A, E.

We need to make a second guess. We should pick a word that:
1. Has 'N' in the fourth position (since it's fixed per the feedback).
2. Does not contain the letters C, R, A, E (as they are not in the word).
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Possible words with 'N' at position 4? Let's think of 5-letter words ending with ...N? Actually position 4 is the fourth letter. So the pattern is: ? ? ? N ?

Since the word must have an 'N' at position 4, and must avoid C, R, A, E.

We can consider words like:
- WINDY, but let's check: W I N D Y -> N at pos 3? Wait, no: positions in a 5-letter word: 
  Position 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?

In ""windy"": 
  Pos1: W, Pos2: I, Pos3: N, Pos4: D, Pos5: Y -> doesn't have N at 4.

We need words where the fourth letter is N. Examples:
- ""BLANK"": letters B, L, A, N, K -> but A is already excluded (feedback said A not in word), so cannot use A.
- ""CLINK"": has C -> excluded.
- ""SKUNK"": but has K at position 5? And U? Also, we don't know about K yet. But S? We don't know. But we cannot use C,R,A,E. So S is allowed? Let's list words.

Actually, common words with N at position 4:
- ""POINT"": P O I N T -> has I and O? But we don't know about O or I or T.
- ""JOINT"": J O I N T -> similar.
- ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> O and U? 
- ""DAUNT"": D A U N T -> but A is excluded (we know A is not in the word).
- ""COUNT"": C O U N T -> has C -> excluded.

We must avoid A, C, E, R.

Other possibilities:
- ""BOUND"": B O U N D -> no A,C,E,R? But O and U are unknown. Also, D at the end.
- ""FOUND"": F O U N D -> same, but F?
- ""POUND"": same.
- ""WOUND"": W O U N D -> same.

But note: we haven't used the fact that we can test other common letters.

Also, words without the forbidden letters: so we can use B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (except A, C, E, R).

We want to maximize information. So we should use letters that are frequently used, and avoid repeating letters we already know are absent.

Another word: ""SHOWN"": S H O W N -> positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4)? Wait, in ""shown"", the fourth letter is W? Then fifth is N? No, ""SHOWN"" has 5 letters: S-H-O-W-N? Actually, no: it's S-H-O-W-N? Wait, let me check.

Actually, ""SHOWN"" is S-H-O-W-N? That would be S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). We need N at position 4? Here N is at position 5. So incorrect.

We need a word with the fourth letter as N. So the word pattern: _ _ _ N _

Let me try to think of words: 
- ""BLUNT"": B L U N T -> fourth letter is N. And letters: B,L,U,T -> none of A,C,E,R? Yes. So it's a candidate.
- ""GRUNT"": G R U N T -> but R is excluded? R is not allowed because feedback said R(x) -> not in the word. So no R.
- ""STUNG"": S T U N G -> positions: S(1),T(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) -> has N at position 4. Letters: S,T,U,G -> none forbidden.

So ""STUNG"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""SWUNG"": S W U N G -> same, but with W.

Also, ""DOING"": D O I N G -> position: D(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> that fits. Letters: D,O,I,G -> none forbidden.

But note: in ""DOING"", the word has 'O','I','G', and we don't know about them.

Another: ""GOING"": G O I N G -> same as above, but starts with G.

We should choose a word that has as many new letters as possible and avoids the known absent ones.

My goal is to cover common vowels and consonants. We haven't tested: O, I, U, and consonants like S, T, L, D, etc.

I am considering ""STUNG"": 
- It has S, T, U, N, G -> N is fixed at position 4. We avoid forbidden letters.

But note: ""STUNG"" has the letter U, which is a vowel, and S,T,G are common.

Alternatively, ""BLIND"": but position? B L I N D -> N is at position 4? B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). Okay. But we cannot use BLIND? Because it has I? But we don't know. And letters: B, L, I, N, D -> none forbidden.

However, we already know N is at position 4, so we can fix that.

But wait, in ""BLIND"", the word has 'I' and 'D'. We have to see which gives more coverage.

I could also consider ""POINT"" but it has O and I? But note: ""POINT"" is P O I N T -> N at position 4? P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.

But we don't know about O, I, P, T.

We want to avoid previously excluded letters? Only A,C,E,R are excluded.

So POINT is valid? Letters: P, O, I, N, T -> no A,C,E,R.

Similarly, JOINT, but J is less common.

Another word: ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> letters M, O, U, N, T -> no forbidden.

But U is in there.

I think either ""POINT"", ""STUNG"", or ""BLUNT"" would be good.

But note: we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4). We need to test other positions.

I am leaning toward ""POINT"" because it has common letters: P, O, I, T.

Alternatively, ""STUNG"" has S,T,U,N,G.

But since N is fixed at 4, in ""POINT"" we have:
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N (known)
- Position 5: T

That gives us information about positions 1,2,3,5.

Similarly, ""STUNG"": 
- Position 1: S
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: U
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G

We haven't tested S, T, U, G.

But ""POINT"" includes the vowels O and I, which might be more informative.

I recall that in Wordle strategy, we often want to cover vowels. In our first guess ""crane"", we tested A and E, both excluded. So the word must have other vowels: I,O,U or sometimes Y.

Therefore, testing O and I in ""POINT"" might be good.

But note: we don't know if the word has O or I. It could have U or something.

But for maximizing information, let's go with ""POINT"".

Another idea: since we know N at position 4, and we know the word doesn't have A,C,E,R, we might choose a word that uses the letter S? S is very common.

But ""POINT"" has no S.

Alternatively, we could do ""STINT"": S T I N T -> but then T is at positions 2 and 5? That would be S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But T at position 2 and 5? That's using T twice. Not good because we are wasting a slot on a repeated letter.

Better to use distinct letters.

So, ""POINT"" has distinct letters: P,O,I,N,T -> that's good.

Similarly, ""STUNG"" has distinct: S,T,U,N,G -> distinct.

I think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.

But let's make sure: can we use ""POINT""? Yes.

So I'll go with ""POINT"".

Therefore, the second guess is ""POINT"".

- N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, marked with ""✓"")

The secret word:
- Must have ""N"" as the 4th letter
- Must not contain C, R, A, or E

For the second guess, I chose ""POINT"" because:
- It places ""N"" in the 4th position as required
- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)
- It introduces new, common letters: P, O, I, T
- These letters cover vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T) to maximize information
- All letters are distinct to test more possibilities

<guess>point</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the second guess ""point"":
- P: x -> not in the word
- O: x -> not in the word
- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, since in ""point"", I is the third letter)
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, as before)
- T: x -> not in the word

So now we know:
- The secret word has ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4.
- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, T (from both guesses).

Additionally, we know the word must be of the form: _ _ I N _

We need to avoid the letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use I and N, but they are already placed).

We must form a 5-letter word with the pattern _ _ I N _.

We should choose a word that uses common letters from the available set to maximize information.

Common letters to consider: S, U, L, D, M, H, G, B, etc.

Let's think of words that fit the pattern and use only the available letters.

Possible words:
- ""BLINK"": B L I N K -> but we have B, L, I, N, K. However, we don't know about B, L, K. But note: we have to avoid the forbidden letters? B, L, K are allowed. But wait, ""BLINK"" has I at position 3 and N at 4? 
  Positions: B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), K(5) -> yes, matches.
  But we have to check if any letter is forbidden: B, L, K are not in the forbidden list (A,C,E,O,P,R,T). So it's allowed.

- ""CLINK"": but C is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""FLING"": F L I N G -> F(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: F, L, G -> allowed? F, L, G are not forbidden. So yes.

- ""SLING"": S L I N G -> S(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, L, G are allowed.

- ""STING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""SWING"": S W I N G -> S(1), W(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). S, W, G allowed.

- ""BRING"": B R I N G -> but R is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""THING"": T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> D(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). D, Y, G allowed.

- ""FLINT"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""BLIND"": B L I N D -> B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). B, L, D allowed.

- ""BLIMP"": but P is forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""GLINT"": T forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""QUINT"": Q U I N T -> T forbidden -> not allowed.

- ""JUIN?"": not a word.

We have several candidates: ""BLINK"", ""FLING"", ""SLING"", ""SWING"", ""DYING"", ""BLIND"".

We want to choose one that uses letters we haven't tested yet and are common.

We haven't tested: S, B, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, U, W, Y, etc.

In ""BLINK"": tests B, L, K (and I and N are known).
In ""FLING"": tests F, L, G.
In ""SLING"": tests S, L, G.
In ""SWING"": tests S, W, G.
In ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G.
In ""BLIND"": tests B, L, D.

We know I and N are fixed, so we are only testing the first, second, and fifth letters.

We should avoid using letters that might be less common? But we need to cover as many possibilities.

Note: We have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.

I think ""SLING"" is a good candidate because S and L are very common letters.

Alternatively, ""SWING"" has W, which is less common, so maybe not.

""BLINK"" has K, which is also common.

But let's see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.

We can also consider ""SHINY"": but position? S H I N Y -> I is at position 3? S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes. And letters: S, H, Y -> allowed? H and Y are not forbidden. So ""SHINY"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""WHINY"": W H I N Y -> same, W and H.

But we don't know about H.

Another: ""SKIN?"": but we need 5 letters. ""SKINS"" is 5 letters but ends with S? Pattern is _ _ I N _, so fifth letter must be something. ""SKINS"" is S K I N S -> but that has I at position 3? S(1), K(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But S is repeated? And we don't know if S is in the word. But it's allowed? The word must have the pattern, and S is at position 1 and 5. But we are testing, so it's okay? However, repeating S might not be efficient because if S is in the word, we might not know where. But since we are testing position 1 and 5, it could be useful? Actually, if S is in the word, we get feedback for both positions. But it's not ideal for information.

So better to avoid repeats.

Therefore, ""SKINS"" is not great because of the repeated S.

Stick with distinct letters.

Another word: ""BUILD"": but I is at position 3? B U I L D -> B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> but we need N at position 4, not L. So no.

We must have I at 3 and N at 4.

So the word must be: ? ? I N ?

I think ""SLING"" is a good choice: common letters S, L, G.

""FLING"" is also good: F, L, G.

But F is less common than S? S is more common.

Similarly, ""BLIND"" has B, L, D.

I think S is the most common consonant, so let's go with a word that has S.

""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> I and N known, so testing S, L, G.

We can also consider ""SHINS"": but repeated S? S H I N S -> repeated S and we don't know if S is in the word. Not ideal.

""SHINE"": but E is forbidden -> not allowed.

""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> distinct letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N known, so testing S, H, Y.

H and Y are less common? But we have to test them.

I think ""SLING"" is better because L is more common than H.

Another candidate: ""SMITH"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

""SPRIG"": P and R forbidden -> not allowed.

""SWING"": S W I N G -> testing S, W, G. W is less common.

""BLINK"": B L I N K -> testing B, L, K. B and K are common.

But S is more common than B? In English, S is the most common letter at the end, but we are at the beginning.

Since we are testing the first, second, and fifth letters, we should cover common letters for those positions.

For position 1: common letters: S, B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, etc.
For position 2: vowels or common consonants? But we don't have many vowels left: we have U and Y (and sometimes W, Y as vowels). We already know A, E, I, O are not in the word? We know A, E, O are not in the word, but I is in the word at position 3. So the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, because it could have U or Y.

But in 5-letter words, there is usually at least two vowels? Not always, but often.

We have I as one vowel. It might have U or Y.

In ""SLING"": the vowels are I only? L, G are consonants. So it has only one vowel? But that's possible, e.g., ""lynch"", but we have I.

Similarly, ""BLINK"" has I and that's it? B, L, I, N, K -> only I as vowel? But that might be acceptable.

But let's check: ""lynch"" has Y as vowel. In ""BLINK"", I is the only vowel, which is acceptable.

But we might want to test a vowel? We have U and Y available.

In ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> Y is a vowel? So it has two vowels: Y and I. That might be good because we can check if Y is in the word.

Similarly, ""SHINY"" has I and Y.

So ""DYING"" or ""SHINY"" might be better to test a vowel.

But we don't know if the word has a vowel at position 2 or 5? It could.

Given that we have only one vowel (I) so far, and the word might have another vowel (U or Y), it would be good to test one of them.

So let's consider ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G. Y is a vowel.

""SHINY"": tests S, H, Y. Also Y.

""JUINY"" not a word.

""BUYIN"" not a word.

""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: L, Y, G -> allowed. And it has Y as a vowel.

So ""LYING"" is a candidate.

Similarly, ""TYING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.

So we have ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""SHINY"".

Now, among these, which one to choose?

""DYING"": D, Y, G
""LYING"": L, Y, G
""SHINY"": S, H, Y

We want to test common letters. S is more common than D or L? S is very common.

But H is less common.

Also, we are testing Y in all.

I think ""SHINY"" is good because it tests S and H, and Y.

But ""LYING"" tests L and Y, G.

G is common.

But S is the most common, so let's go with ""SHINY"" to test S and H.

Alternatively, we can choose ""SLING"" to test S and L, but without a vowel.

But we have to consider that the word might not have Y, so testing Y might not be necessary.

But we don't know, so it's better to test a vowel if possible.

Since we are at the third guess, and we have three positions to test (1,2,5), we can test one vowel and two consonants.

In ""SHINY"", we test S (consonant), H (consonant), Y (vowel). That's a good mix.

In ""LYING"", we test L (consonant), Y (vowel), G (consonant). Also good.

But S is more common than L, so ""SHINY"" might be better? But H is less common than G? H is more common than G? Let me think.

In English, the frequency of letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... So S is 7th, H is 8th, L is 11th, G is 16th, Y is 20th, etc.

So S and H are both in the top 10.

In ""SHINY"", we test S and H, which are high frequency, and Y which is less common but a vowel.

In ""LYING"", we test L (11th), Y (20th), G (16th) — lower frequency.

So ""SHINY"" seems better for covering common letters.

Also, ""SHINY"" is a common word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""SHINY"".

But let's confirm the pattern: S H I N Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I (correct), 4:N (correct), 5:Y.

And letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N are known, so we are testing S, H, Y.

And no forbidden letters.

So guess: ""SHINY""

But note: we have to make sure that Y is allowed at the end. Yes, it is.

So I think that's a good guess.

Alternatively, we could choose ""SLING"" to avoid the less common Y? But then we don't test a vowel.

But let's see: if we guess ""SLING"", and it turns out the word has Y, we might not find it.

But we have to make a choice.

I think testing a vowel is important, so ""SHINY"" is better.

Another candidate: ""SWING"" has W, which is less common than H? W is 15th, H is 8th, so H is better.

So I'll go with ""SHINY"".

<guess>shiny</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - **C, R, A, E** are not in the word.  
- **Guess 2: ""point""** → Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - **N** is confirmed again at position 4.  
  - **P, O, T** are not in the word.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I N _` (positions: 1, 2, 3=I, 4=N, 5).  
- Excluded letters (not in the word): **A, C, E, O, P, R, T**.  
- Available letters (not yet tested or confirmed): **B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  
- Since the word must contain at least one vowel (besides I), and **A, E, O** are excluded, the remaining vowel possibilities are **U** or **Y** (or rarely, **W** as part of a diphthong).  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- **Goal:** Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, L, D) and the vowel **Y** (to cover vowel possibilities).  
- **Pattern constraint:** Must be `_ _ I N _`.  
- **Avoid:** Repeating excluded letters or known letters unnecessarily.  
- **Ideal word:** Uses distinct, untested letters to maximize information.  

### Why ""shiny""?
- **Fits the pattern:** `S H I N Y` → Positions 3 and 4 are fixed as **I** and **N**.  
- **Tests key letters:**  
  - **S** (high-frequency consonant, position 1).  
  - **H** (common consonant, position 2).  
  - **Y** (vowel candidate, position 5; tests if the word has a second vowel).  
- **Avoids excluded letters:** No A, C, E, O, P, R, T.  
- **Distinct letters:** All letters are unique, testing three new positions (1, 2, 5) efficiently.  
- **Common word:** ""Shiny"" is a valid English word, reducing the risk of invalid guesses.  

If ""shiny"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal:  
- Whether **S** is in the word (and if so, its position).  
- Whether **H** is in the word (and if so, its position).  
- Whether **Y** is in the word (and if so, its position).  

This will significantly narrow down possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>shiny</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: shiny -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) Y(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the third guess ""shiny"":
- S: x -> not in the word
- H: x -> not in the word
- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter)
- Y: - -> in the word but in the wrong position

So, from this feedback:
- The secret word has the letter 'Y' but not at position 5 (since it's marked as ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).
- The letters S and H are not in the word.

Now, combining with previous feedback:

Excluded letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T, S, H (from guesses 1, 2, and 3)

Confirmed positions:
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N

And we know the word has Y, but not at position 5.

Since Y is in the word but not at position 5, and the only positions left are 1, 2, and 5, but position 5 is not Y, so Y must be at position 1 or 2.

Pattern: _ _ I N _

We know Y is in the word and must be at position 1 or 2.

Also, the word does not contain: A, C, E, H, O, P, R, S, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but Y is already known to be in the word, so we can use it, but we need to place it at position 1 or 2).

We must form a word that has Y at position 1 or 2, and I at 3, N at 4, and the fifth letter is unknown.

Also, the word must not contain the excluded letters.

Now, for the fourth guess, we need to test possibilities for the remaining positions.

We know Y is at 1 or 2. We can try to fix Y at position 1 and see what words are possible, or at position 2.

But we need to make a guess that will help us distinguish.

We should also test other common letters for the remaining positions.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and constraints.

First, if Y is at position 1:
- Pattern: Y _ I N _
- The second letter can be one of the available letters, and the fifth letter one of the available letters, but not excluded.

But we have to avoid the excluded letters.

Similarly, if Y is at position 2:
- Pattern: _ Y I N _

Now, we need to choose a guess that can test both possibilities? Or we can commit to one and see.

But we have three positions to determine: 1, 2, and 5, but with Y being at 1 or 2, so if we fix Y at one position, we can test the other.

We can also choose a word that has Y at position 1 and then test common letters for 2 and 5, or vice versa.

But note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6).

We should try to cover as many letters as possible.

Since Y is the only vowel we know besides I, and we have to have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but the word might have U or other.

But we have Y, so that's covered.

Now, let's think of words that fit.

First, with Y at position 1: Y _ I N _

Possible words:
- ""YOGIN"": but O is excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUKIN"": not a word? 
- ""YULIN"": not a common word? 
- ""YAPON"": A and O excluded -> invalid.
- ""YAWIN"": A excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUCKY"": but C and K? C is excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUCKS"": C and S excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUGAS"": S excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUKKY"": K and Y repeated? But K is allowed? But ""YUKKY"" is not a word? 
- ""YULAN"": A excluded -> invalid.
- ""YUPON"": O and P excluded -> invalid.

It's hard to find words with Y at 1 and then a vowel? But we have U available.

""YUMMY"": M and Y repeated? But ""YUMMY"" has Y at 1 and 5, and U at 2? Pattern: Y U M M Y -> but position 3 is M, but we need I at 3? No, position 3 must be I, so ""YUMMY"" doesn't have I at 3.

We need the third letter to be I.

So, for Y at 1: Y ? I N ?

The second letter must be a consonant or vowel that can form a word.

Possible words:
- ""YDI?"": not a word.
- ""YF?"": not.

Actually, I can't think of many. Let me list valid English words.

Common words: 
- ""BEGIN"": but B E G I N -> E is excluded -> invalid.
- ""BLUIN"": not a word.

Perhaps ""LYING"": but we already guessed ""shiny"", and ""lying"" has Y at position 2? Not at 1.

With Y at 1, I think ""YOWIE"": but O and E excluded -> invalid.

""YUKON"": O excluded -> invalid.

""YUPON"": O and P excluded.

It seems difficult. Maybe Y at position 1 is not common.

Now, with Y at position 2: _ Y I N _

Pattern: ? Y I N ?

This is more promising.

For example:
- ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> this is a word. And D, G are not excluded? D and G are allowed.
- ""FLYING"": F L Y I N G -> but that's 6 letters? No, ""FLYING"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.
- ""TYING"": T excluded -> invalid.
- ""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L, Y, I, N, G -> L and G allowed? Yes. And we haven't tested L or G.
- ""VYING"": V Y I N G -> V is allowed? Yes. V, Y, I, N, G.
- ""MYTHS"": but T and H excluded -> invalid.
- ""GYPSY"": P and S excluded -> invalid.
- ""BYLAW"": but A and W? A excluded -> invalid.
- ""CYTON"": C excluded -> invalid.
- ""GYNIC"": C excluded -> invalid.
- ""SYNOD"": S and O excluded -> invalid.

So the common words with Y at position 2 and I at 3: ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

We also have ""PYLON"", but P and O excluded.

""HYMNS"": H excluded -> invalid.

So the candidates are: ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

Now, we also have the fifth letter to consider.

In ""DYING"": fifth letter is G.
In ""LYING"": fifth letter is G.
In ""VYING"": fifth letter is G.

All end with G? Not necessarily, but in these words they do.

Are there others? ""MYN?"": not a word.

""WYNDS"": but S excluded -> invalid.

""XYST?"": not common.

So the main candidates are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

We need to choose one to guess.

But note: we also have to consider that the fifth letter might not be G? But in the pattern, it could be something else.

For example, is there a word like ""XYLIC""? But C excluded and X Y L I C -> position 3 is L, not I? No.

Or ""BYSSI"": S excluded and not I at 3.

I think ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"" are the main ones.

But we know Y is in the word and not at position 5, so in these words, Y is at position 2, which is consistent.

Now, for the guess, we can choose one of these to test.

But if we guess one of them and it's correct, we win. If not, we get feedback.

But we need to maximize information.

We have not tested D, L, V, or G yet.

G is common, so if we guess one of these, we test G at position 5.

But if we guess ""DYING"", we test D at 1 and G at 5.

Similarly, ""LYING"" tests L at 1 and G at 5.

""VYING"" tests V at 1 and G at 5.

V is less common than D or L.

So we should choose between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"".

D and L are both common.

We can choose ""LYING"" because L is slightly more common than D? Or D?

Letter frequency: L is more common than D (L is 11th, D is 10th? Actually, D is 9th, L is 10th? Close).

But we can also consider that we might get information about the first letter.

Another thing: we know that the word has Y, so if we guess a word with Y at position 2, and if it's correct, we get confirmation.

But we already know Y is in the word, so the feedback will tell us if Y is at position 2 or not? Not exactly, because if we put Y at position 2 and it's correct, we get ✓, if not, we get - or x? But we know Y is in the word, so if we put it at position 2 and it's not there, we still get - meaning it's elsewhere, but we know it must be at position 1 or 2, so if it's not at 2, it must be at 1.

Similarly, if we put it at 1 and it's not there, it must be at 2.

So we can use the guess to pin down the position of Y.

But in this case, for the fourth guess, we can choose to put Y at position 1 or 2.

But earlier we saw that words with Y at 1 are rare, so it's more likely at 2.

Therefore, we can guess one of ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

I think ""LYING"" is a good choice because L is common.

But we already have feedback that S and H are not in the word, so no issue.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that has Y at position 1 to test that possibility, but it might be hard to find.

For example, is there a word like ""YINCE""? Not a word.

""YITIE""? Not.

""YLIKE""? Not.

I think it's safer to assume Y is at position 2.

So let's choose between ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

""VYING"" has V, which is less common, so we might avoid that.

Between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"", both are valid.

We can choose ""LYING"" because it uses L, which we haven't tested.

But we haven't tested D either.

We can also consider that in ""LYING"", if we guess it, and it's not correct, we get feedback on L and G.

Similarly for ""DYING"".

But note: we have to consider the fifth letter. In all these, it's G, so if G is not in the word, we know that none of these are the word, and Y must be at position 1? But we don't have a word for that.

But if G is not in the word, then we know the fifth letter is not G, and Y must be at position 1, and we need to find a word with Y at 1 and I at 3, N at 4, and a fifth letter.

But as we saw, such words are rare, so it might be that G is in the word.

We can also choose a word that has Y at position 1 to directly test that.

For example, is there a valid word with Y at 1? Let's search.

""YCLAD"": C excluded -> invalid.

""YDRAD"": not a word.

""YFERE"": E excluded -> invalid.

""YIKES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.

""YIRTH"": H excluded -> invalid.

""YLIKE"": not a word.

""YMOLT"": O excluded -> invalid.

""YMPES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.

""YOGIN"": O excluded -> invalid.

""YOKED"": O, E, D? O and E excluded -> invalid.

""YONIC"": O and C excluded -> invalid.

""YORES"": O, E, S excluded -> invalid.

""YOUKS"": O, U, K, S? O excluded -> invalid.

""YOURS"": O, U, R, S excluded -> invalid.

""YOWES"": O, E, S excluded -> invalid.

""YOWIE"": O, E, I? O and E excluded -> invalid.

""YRApt"": not a word.

""YRENT"": E excluded -> invalid.

""YRIVD"": not a word.

""YRNEH"": not a word.

""YSLUM"": S excluded -> invalid.

""YTOST"": O and T excluded -> invalid.

""YUANS"": A, U, S excluded -> invalid.

""YUCCH"": C and H excluded -> invalid.

""YUCKY"": C and K? C excluded -> invalid.

""YUGAS"": S excluded -> invalid.

""YUKKY"": K excluded? K is allowed, but ""YUKKY"" is not a standard word? It might be slang, but let's avoid.

""YULES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.

""YUMMY"": M and Y repeated, and no I at 3 -> invalid.

""YURTA"": U, R, T, A? A, R, T excluded -> invalid.

I cannot find a valid 5-letter word with Y at position 1, I at 3, N at 4, and without excluded letters.

Therefore, it is highly likely that Y is at position 2.

So the word must be of the form _ Y I N _

And the candidates are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"", and possibly others with different fifth letters.

But earlier I thought of only those three, but is there a word with a different fifth letter?

For example, ""MYTHI"": H and T excluded -> invalid.

""SYNCH"": S and H excluded -> invalid.

""WYNDS"": S excluded -> invalid.

""XYLIC"": C excluded -> invalid.

""BYNIN"": not a word.

""KYLIN"": K Y L I N -> but that's K at 1, Y at 2, L at 3? But we need I at 3, not L. ""KYLIN"" has I at position 4? K(1), Y(2), L(3), I(4), N(5) -> but we need I at 3 and N at 4, so position 4 is I, not N. So no.

""PYINS"": P and S excluded -> invalid.

""TYI?"": T excluded.

""ZYMIN"": M I N? Z Y M I N -> Z(1), Y(2), M(3), I(4), N(5) -> again, I at 4, not 3.

So no, the only common words are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".

Therefore, we should guess one of these.

Now, to choose, we can pick ""LYING"" because L is more common than D or V? L is more common than V, but D and L are close.

Since we have three options, and we need to test, we can choose the most common one.

""LYING"" is a very common word.

We can also consider that if we guess ""LYING"" and it's wrong, we get feedback on L and G.

Similarly for others.

But let's see the frequency: ""LYING"" is more common than ""DYING"" or ""VYING"".

""DYING"" is also common.

But ""VYING"" is less common.

So between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"", I'll choose ""LYING"".

So the guess is ""LYING"".

But note: in ""LYING"", the letters are L, Y, I, N, G.

We know I and N are correct and in place.

Y is in the word but we are testing it at position 2.

L is at position 1, G at position 5.

If the word is ""LYING"", we win.

If not, we get feedback on L and G.

If L is not in the word, then we know the first letter must be D or V (from the candidates).

Similarly, if G is not in the word, then none of the candidates are valid, but we know Y must be at position 2, so the fifth letter must be something else, but we don't have a candidate, so it might be a rare word.

But let's hope it's one of the common ones.

So I'll go with ""LYING"".

<guess>lying</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  
  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.  
  - **C, R, A, E** are not in the word.  
- **Guess 2: ""point""** → Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  
  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  
  - **N** is confirmed again at position 4.  
  - **P, O, T** are not in the word.  
- **Guess 3: ""shiny""** → Feedback: S(x), H(x), I(✓), N(✓), Y(-)  
  - **I** and **N** are confirmed at positions 3 and 4.  
  - **S** and **H** are not in the word.  
  - **Y** is in the word but not at position 5.  

### Deductions:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ I N _` (positions: 1, 2, 3=I, 4=N, 5).  
- **Excluded letters** (not in the word): A, C, E, H, O, P, R, S, T.  
- **Confirmed letters in the word**: I, N, Y.  
  - **Y** must be at position 1 or 2 (since it is in the word but not at position 5).  
- **Available letters** (not tested or confirmed): B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
- **Key constraints**:  
  - Position 1: Must be one of B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but Y could be here).  
  - Position 2: Must be Y or another available letter (but Y must be at position 1 or 2).  
  - Position 5: Must be one of the available letters.  

### Strategy for the Next Guess:
- **Goal**: Test the position of **Y** (position 1 or 2) and cover common consonants for the remaining positions.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Since **Y** must be at position 1 or 2, and no valid 5-letter words exist with **Y** at position 1 (based on pattern `Y _ I N _` and excluded letters), **Y** is likely at position 2.  
  - Focus on words with the pattern `_ Y I N _` to test this.  
  - Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, D, G) for positions 1 and 5 to maximize information.  
- **Word choice**: ""lying"" fits perfectly:  
  - Pattern: `L Y I N G` → Tests **L** at position 1, **Y** at position 2, and **G** at position 5.  
  - Uses distinct, untested letters (L, G) and confirms **Y** placement.  
  - Avoids all excluded letters.  
- **Why not other candidates?**  
  - ""dying"" and ""vying"" are alternatives, but ""lying"" uses **L** (more common than **D** or **V**) and is a high-frequency word.  
  - If ""lying"" is incorrect, feedback on **L** and **G** will quickly narrow possibilities (e.g., if **L** is absent, position 1 must be **D** or **V**; if **G** is absent, position 5 is another letter).

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)
Guess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)
Guess 3: shiny -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) Y(-)
Guess 4: lying -> FEEDBACK: L(x) Y(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the fourth guess ""lying"":
- L: x -> not in the word
- Y: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter)
- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter)
- G: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (5th letter)

So, summarizing the secret word:
- Position 2: Y
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G
- Only position 1 is unknown.

The word is: ? Y I N G

We know the first letter is missing, but we know which letters are excluded.

Excluded letters from previous feedback: A, C, E, H, O, P, R, T, S, L (from guesses 1 to 4). Specifically, from:
- Guess 1: C, R, A, E excluded
- Guess 2: P, O, T excluded
- Guess 3: S, H excluded
- Guess 4: L excluded

So excluded: A, C, E, H, L, O, P, R, S, T.

We need to find a letter for position 1 that is not excluded and forms a valid English word.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note:
- G is already at position 5, so it could be repeated? But we need a letter for position 1. However, G is allowed at position 1 unless excluded? But G is not excluded. Excluded are listed above.
- But we need to complete the word: ?YING

Common words ending with ""YING"": 
- ""DYING"": but D is available? Yes, but D is not excluded.
- ""EYING"": but E is excluded -> not possible.
- ""TYING"": T excluded -> not possible.
- ""HYING"": H excluded -> not possible.
- ""LYING"": we guessed it and L is excluded -> not possible.
- ""VYING"": V is available? Yes.

Also, other possibilities? 
- ""BYING"": is it a word? ""Buying"" is, but ""buying"" starts with B? Wait, ""BUYING""? But that would be B-U-Y-I-N-G? That's 6 letters? No, ""buying"" has 6 letters? Actually, ""buy"" is 3, ""buying"" is 6 letters. So not 5-letter.

We need 5-letter words.

The ending is ""YING"", and the word must be of the form X Y I N G.

Possible words:
- ""DYING"": D Y I N G
- ""VYING"": V Y I N G
- ""MYING""? Not a word.
- ""KYING""? Not a word.
- ""FYING""? Not a word.
- ""GYING"": G Y I N G -> but G repeated? And not a common word.

Valid English words: 
- ""Dying"" (to cease living)
- ""Vying"" (competing eagerly)

Also, ""Sying""? S excluded.

""Hying""? H excluded.

""Tying""? T excluded.

So only ""DYING"" and ""VYING"" are candidates.

We haven't tested D or V.

We are on the fifth guess. We have 2 guesses left.

We can guess either ""DYING"" or ""VYING"".

To maximize information? But we know if we guess one, and it's correct, we win. If not, the other must be correct.

Since we have two choices, we need to pick one.

We can guess ""DYING"" because D is more common than V? Or randomly.

Note: We don't have feedback on D or V.

But we can choose one, say ""DYING"".

Then, if it's not correct, we know it's ""VYING"".

So let's guess ""DYING"".

But note: we must avoid excluded letters: D is not excluded, so okay.

Format: <guess>dying</guess>

But let's be precise: is there any other word?

What about ""BYING""? No, not a word.

""EYING"": E excluded.

""PYING"": P excluded.

""RYING"": R excluded.

""SYING"": S excluded.

""TYING"": T excluded.

""WYING""? Not a word.

So only ""DYING"" and ""VYING"".

Therefore, guessing ""DYING"" now.

- **Position 1 constraints**: Must be an untested letter (not excluded) that forms a valid English word. Remaining possibilities: B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  
  - **G** is at position 5 → Cannot repeat unless valid, but `GYING` is not a standard word.  
- **Valid candidates**: Only `DYING` (D at position 1) and `VYING` (V at position 1) fit the pattern and constraints.  

### Strategy for the Next Guess (Guess 5):
- **Goal**: Test one candidate (`DYING`) to resolve position 1, leveraging `D` as a high-frequency consonant. If incorrect, `VYING` must be the solution.  
- **Choice**: ""dying"" prioritizes `D` (more common than `V`) and resolves all uncertainty with one guess.

We should pick a word that:\n1. Has \'N\' in the fourth position (since it\'s fixed per the feedback).\n2. Does not contain the letters C, R, A, E (as they are not in the word).\n3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.\n\nPossible words with \'N\' at position 4? Let\'s think of 5-letter words ending with ...N? Actually position 4 is the fourth letter. So the pattern is: ? ? ? N ?\n\nSince the word must have an \'N\' at position 4, and must avoid C, R, A, E.\n\nWe can consider words like:\n- WINDY, but let\'s check: W I N D Y -> N at pos 3? Wait, no: positions in a 5-letter word: \n  Position 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: ?, 4: N, 5: ?\n\nIn ""windy"": \n  Pos1: W, Pos2: I, Pos3: N, Pos4: D, Pos5: Y -> doesn\'t have N at 4.\n\nWe need words where the fourth letter is N.

And U? Also, we don\'t know about K yet. But S? We don\'t know. But we cannot use C,R,A,E. So S is allowed?

But we don\'t know about O or I or T.\n- ""JOINT"": J O I N T -> similar.\n- ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> O and U? \n- ""DAUNT"": D A U N T -> but A is excluded (we know A is not in the word).\n- ""COUNT"": C O U N T -> has C -> excluded.\n\nWe must avoid A, C, E, R.\n\nOther possibilities:\n- ""BOUND"": B O U N D -> no A,C,E,R? But O and U are unknown. Also, D at the end.\n- ""FOUND"": F O U N D -> same, but F?\n- ""POUND"": same.\n- ""WOUND"": W O U N D -> same.\n\nBut note: we haven\'t used the fact that we can test other common letters.\n\nAlso, words without the forbidden letters: so we can use B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z (except A, C, E, R).\n\nWe want to maximize information. So we should use letters that are frequently used, and avoid repeating letters we already know are absent.\n\nAnother word: ""SHOWN"": S H O W N -> positions: S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4)? Wait, in ""shown"", the fourth letter is W? Then fifth is N? No, ""SHOWN"" has 5 letters: S-H-O-W-N? Actually, no: it\'s S-H-O-W-N? Wait, let me check.\n\nActually, ""SHOWN"" is S-H-O-W-N? That would be S(1), H(2), O(3), W(4), N(5). We need N at position 4? Here N is at position 5. So incorrect.\n\nWe need a word with the fourth letter as N. So the word pattern: _ _ _ N _\n\nLet me try to think of words: \n- ""BLUNT"": B L U N T -> fourth letter is N. And letters: B,L,U,T -> none of A,C,E,R? Yes. So it\'s a candidate.\n- ""GRUNT"": G R U N T -> but R is excluded? R is not allowed because feedback said R(x) -> not in the word. So no R.\n- ""STUNG"": S T U N G -> positions: S(1),T(2),U(3),N(4),G(5) -> has N at position 4. Letters: S,T,U,G -> none forbidden.\n\nSo ""STUNG"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""SWUNG"": S W U N G -> same, but with W.\n\nAlso, ""DOING"": D O I N G -> position: D(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), G(5) -> that fits. Letters: D,O,I,G -> none forbidden.\n\nBut note: in ""DOING"", the word has \'O\',\'I\',\'G\', and we don\'t know about them.\n\nAnother: ""GOING"": G O I N G -> same as above, but starts with G.\n\nWe should choose a word that has as many new letters as possible and avoids the known absent ones.\n\nMy goal is to cover common vowels and consonants. We haven\'t tested: O, I, U, and consonants like S, T, L, D, etc.\n\nI am considering ""STUNG"": \n- It has S, T, U, N, G -> N is fixed at position 4. We avoid forbidden letters.\n\nBut note: ""STUNG"" has the letter U, which is a vowel, and S,T,G are common.\n\nAlternatively, ""BLIND"": but position? B L I N D -> N is at position 4? B(1), L(2), I(3), N(4), D(5). Okay. But we cannot use BLIND? Because it has I? But we don\'t know. And letters: B, L, I, N, D -> none forbidden.\n\nHowever, we already know N is at position 4, so we can fix that.\n\nBut wait, in ""BLIND"", the word has \'I\' and \'D\'. We have to see which gives more coverage.\n\nI could also consider ""POINT"" but it has O and I? But note: ""POINT"" is P O I N T -> N at position 4? P(1), O(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> yes.\n\nBut we don\'t know about O, I, P, T.\n\nWe want to avoid previously excluded letters? Only A,C,E,R are excluded.\n\nSo POINT is valid? Letters: P, O, I, N, T -> no A,C,E,R.\n\nSimilarly, JOINT, but J is less common.\n\nAnother word: ""MOUNT"": M O U N T -> letters M, O, U, N, T -> no forbidden.\n\nBut U is in there.\n\nI think either ""POINT"", ""STUNG"", or ""BLUNT"" would be good.\n\nBut note: we have only one letter fixed (N at position 4). We need to test other positions.\n\nI am leaning toward ""POINT"" because it has common letters: P, O, I, T.\n\nAlternatively, ""STUNG"" has S,T,U,N,G.\n\nBut since N is fixed at 4, in ""POINT"" we have:\n- Position 1: P\n- Position 2: O\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: N (known)\n- Position 5: T\n\nThat gives us information about positions 1,2,3,5.\n\nSimilarly, ""STUNG"": \n- Position 1: S\n- Position 2: T\n- Position 3: U\n- Position 4: N\n- Position 5: G\n\nWe haven\'t tested S, T, U, G.\n\nBut ""POINT"" includes the vowels O and I, which might be more informative.\n\nI recall that in Wordle strategy, we often want to cover vowels. In our first guess ""crane"", we tested A and E, both excluded. So the word must have other vowels: I,O,U or sometimes Y.\n\nTherefore, testing O and I in ""POINT"" might be good.\n\nBut note: we don\'t know if the word has O or I. It could have U or something.\n\nBut for maximizing information, let\'s go with ""POINT"".\n\nAnother idea: since we know N at position 4, and we know the word doesn\'t have A,C,E,R, we might choose a word that uses the letter S? S is very common.\n\nBut ""POINT"" has no S.\n\nAlternatively, we could do ""STINT"": S T I N T -> but then T is at positions 2 and 5? That would be S(1), T(2), I(3), N(4), T(5). But T at position 2 and 5? That\'s using T twice. Not good because we are wasting a slot on a repeated letter.\n\nBetter to use distinct letters.\n\nSo, ""POINT"" has distinct letters: P,O,I,N,T -> that\'s good.\n\nSimilarly, ""STUNG"" has distinct: S,T,U,N,G -> distinct.\n\nI think ""POINT"" is a solid choice.\n\nBut let\'s make sure: can we use ""POINT""? Yes.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""POINT"".\n\nTherefore, the second guess is ""POINT"".\n\nFormat: <guess>point</guess>Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" where:\n- C, R, A, and E are not in the word (marked with ""x"")\n- N is in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, marked with ""✓"")\n\nThe secret word:\n- Must have ""N"" as the 4th letter\n- Must not contain C, R, A, or E\n\nFor the second guess, I chose ""POINT"" because:\n- It places ""N"" in the 4th position as required\n- It avoids forbidden letters (C, R, A, E)\n- It introduces new, common letters: P, O, I, T\n- These letters cover vowels (O, I) and consonants (P, T) to maximize information\n- All letters are distinct to test more possibilities\n\n<guess>point</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the second guess ""point"":\n- P: x -> not in the word\n- O: x -> not in the word\n- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter, since in ""point"", I is the third letter)\n- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter, as before)\n- T: x -> not in the word\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has ""I"" at position 3 and ""N"" at position 4.\n- The secret word does not contain: C, R, A, E, P, O, T (from both guesses).\n\nAdditionally, we know the word must be of the form: _ _ I N _\n\nWe need to avoid the letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we can use I and N, but they are already placed).\n\nWe must form a 5-letter word with the pattern _ _ I N _.\n\nWe should choose a word that uses common letters from the available set to maximize information.\n\nCommon letters to consider: S, U, L, D, M, H, G, B, etc.\n\nLet\'s think of words that fit the pattern and use only the available letters.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""BLINK"": B L I N K -> but we have B, L, I, N, K.

But we need to cover as many possibilities.\n\nNote: We have only 6 guesses, and we are on the third guess. We want to maximize the chance of getting more feedback.\n\nI think ""SLING"" is a good candidate because S and L are very common letters.\n\nAlternatively, ""SWING"" has W, which is less common, so maybe not.\n\n""BLINK"" has K, which is also common.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency of letters in 5-letter words.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHINY"": but position? S H I N Y -> I is at position 3? S(1), H(2), I(3), N(4), Y(5). Yes. And letters: S, H, Y -> allowed? H and Y are not forbidden. So ""SHINY"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""WHINY"": W H I N Y -> same, W and H.\n\nBut we don\'t know about H.\n\nAnother: ""SKIN?"": but we need 5 letters. ""SKINS"" is 5 letters but ends with S? Pattern is _ _ I N _, so fifth letter must be something. ""SKINS"" is S K I N S -> but that has I at position 3? S(1), K(2), I(3), N(4), S(5). But S is repeated? And we don\'t know if S is in the word. But it\'s allowed? The word must have the pattern, and S is at position 1 and 5. But we are testing, so it\'s okay? However, repeating S might not be efficient because if S is in the word, we might not know where. But since we are testing position 1 and 5, it could be useful? Actually, if S is in the word, we get feedback for both positions. But it\'s not ideal for information.\n\nSo better to avoid repeats.\n\nTherefore, ""SKINS"" is not great because of the repeated S.\n\nStick with distinct letters.\n\nAnother word: ""BUILD"": but I is at position 3? B U I L D -> B(1), U(2), I(3), L(4), D(5) -> but we need N at position 4, not L. So no.\n\nWe must have I at 3 and N at 4.\n\nSo the word must be: ? ? I N ?\n\nI think ""SLING"" is a good choice: common letters S, L, G.\n\n""FLING"" is also good: F, L, G.\n\nBut F is less common than S? S is more common.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLIND"" has B, L, D.\n\nI think S is the most common consonant, so let\'s go with a word that has S.\n\n""SLING"": S, L, I, N, G -> I and N known, so testing S, L, G.\n\nWe can also consider ""SHINS"": but repeated S? S H I N S -> repeated S and we don\'t know if S is in the word. Not ideal.\n\n""SHINE"": but E is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n""SHINY"": S H I N Y -> distinct letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N known, so testing S, H, Y.\n\nH and Y are less common? But we have to test them.\n\nI think ""SLING"" is better because L is more common than H.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SMITH"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n""SPRIG"": P and R forbidden -> not allowed.\n\n""SWING"": S W I N G -> testing S, W, G. W is less common.\n\n""BLINK"": B L I N K -> testing B, L, K. B and K are common.\n\nBut S is more common than B? In English, S is the most common letter at the end, but we are at the beginning.\n\nSince we are testing the first, second, and fifth letters, we should cover common letters for those positions.\n\nFor position 1: common letters: S, B, D, F, G, H, L, M, W, etc.\nFor position 2: vowels or common consonants? But we don\'t have many vowels left: we have U and Y (and sometimes W, Y as vowels). We already know A, E, I, O are not in the word? We know A, E, O are not in the word, but I is in the word at position 3. So the word must have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, because it could have U or Y.\n\nBut in 5-letter words, there is usually at least two vowels? Not always, but often.\n\nWe have I as one vowel. It might have U or Y.\n\nIn ""SLING"": the vowels are I only? L, G are consonants. So it has only one vowel? But that\'s possible, e.g., ""lynch"", but we have I.\n\nSimilarly, ""BLINK"" has I and that\'s it? B, L, I, N, K -> only I as vowel? But that might be acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s check: ""lynch"" has Y as vowel. In ""BLINK"", I is the only vowel, which is acceptable.\n\nBut we might want to test a vowel? We have U and Y available.\n\nIn ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> Y is a vowel? So it has two vowels: Y and I. That might be good because we can check if Y is in the word.\n\nSimilarly, ""SHINY"" has I and Y.\n\nSo ""DYING"" or ""SHINY"" might be better to test a vowel.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has a vowel at position 2 or 5? It could.\n\nGiven that we have only one vowel (I) so far, and the word might have another vowel (U or Y), it would be good to test one of them.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""DYING"": tests D, Y, G. Y is a vowel.\n\n""SHINY"": tests S, H, Y. Also Y.\n\n""JUINY"" not a word.\n\n""BUYIN"" not a word.\n\n""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L(1), Y(2), I(3), N(4), G(5). Letters: L, Y, G -> allowed. And it has Y as a vowel.\n\nSo ""LYING"" is a candidate.\n\nSimilarly, ""TYING"": but T is forbidden -> not allowed.\n\nSo we have ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""SHINY"".\n\nNow, among these, which one to choose?\n\n""DYING"": D, Y, G\n""LYING"": L, Y, G\n""SHINY"": S, H, Y\n\nWe want to test common letters. S is more common than D or L? S is very common.\n\nBut H is less common.\n\nAlso, we are testing Y in all.\n\nI think ""SHINY"" is good because it tests S and H, and Y.\n\nBut ""LYING"" tests L and Y, G.\n\nG is common.\n\nBut S is the most common, so let\'s go with ""SHINY"" to test S and H.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose ""SLING"" to test S and L, but without a vowel.\n\nBut we have to consider that the word might not have Y, so testing Y might not be necessary.\n\nBut we don\'t know, so it\'s better to test a vowel if possible.\n\nSince we are at the third guess, and we have three positions to test (1,2,5), we can test one vowel and two consonants.\n\nIn ""SHINY"", we test S (consonant), H (consonant), Y (vowel). That\'s a good mix.\n\nIn ""LYING"", we test L (consonant), Y (vowel), G (consonant). Also good.\n\nBut S is more common than L, so ""SHINY"" might be better? But H is less common than G? H is more common than G? Let me think.\n\nIn English, the frequency of letters: E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U... So S is 7th, H is 8th, L is 11th, G is 16th, Y is 20th, etc.\n\nSo S and H are both in the top 10.\n\nIn ""SHINY"", we test S and H, which are high frequency, and Y which is less common but a vowel.\n\nIn ""LYING"", we test L (11th), Y (20th), G (16th) — lower frequency.\n\nSo ""SHINY"" seems better for covering common letters.\n\nAlso, ""SHINY"" is a common word.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""SHINY"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the pattern: S H I N Y -> positions: 1:S, 2:H, 3:I (correct), 4:N (correct), 5:Y.\n\nAnd letters: S, H, I, N, Y. I and N are known, so we are testing S, H, Y.\n\nAnd no forbidden letters.\n\nSo guess: ""SHINY""\n\nBut note: we have to make sure that Y is allowed at the end. Yes, it is.\n\nSo I think that\'s a good guess.\n\nAlternatively, we could choose ""SLING"" to avoid the less common Y? But then we don\'t test a vowel.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""SLING"", and it turns out the word has Y, we might not find it.\n\nBut we have to make a choice.\n\nI think testing a vowel is important, so ""SHINY"" is better.\n\nAnother candidate: ""SWING"" has W, which is less common than H? W is 15th, H is 8th, so H is better.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""SHINY"".\n\n<guess>shiny</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  \n  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.  \n  - **C, R, A, E** are not in the word.  \n- **Guess 2: ""point""** → Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  \n  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  \n  - **N** is confirmed again at position 4.  \n  - **P, O, T** are not in the word.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word has the pattern: `_ _ I N _` (positions: 1, 2, 3=I, 4=N, 5).  \n- Excluded letters (not in the word): **A, C, E, O, P, R, T**.  \n- Available letters (not yet tested or confirmed): **B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z**.  \n- Since the word must contain at least one vowel (besides I), and **A, E, O** are excluded, the remaining vowel possibilities are **U** or **Y** (or rarely, **W** as part of a diphthong).  \n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n- **Goal:** Test high-frequency consonants (e.g., S, L, D) and the vowel **Y** (to cover vowel possibilities).  \n- **Pattern constraint:** Must be `_ _ I N _`.  \n- **Avoid:** Repeating excluded letters or known letters unnecessarily.  \n- **Ideal word:** Uses distinct, untested letters to maximize information.  \n\n### Why ""shiny""?\n- **Fits the pattern:** `S H I N Y` → Positions 3 and 4 are fixed as **I** and **N**.  \n- **Tests key letters:**  \n  - **S** (high-frequency consonant, position 1).  \n  - **H** (common consonant, position 2).  \n  - **Y** (vowel candidate, position 5; tests if the word has a second vowel).  \n- **Avoids excluded letters:** No A, C, E, O, P, R, T.  \n- **Distinct letters:** All letters are unique, testing three new positions (1, 2, 5) efficiently.  \n- **Common word:** ""Shiny"" is a valid English word, reducing the risk of invalid guesses.  \n\nIf ""shiny"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal:  \n- Whether **S** is in the word (and if so, its position).  \n- Whether **H** is in the word (and if so, its position).  \n- Whether **Y** is in the word (and if so, its position).  \n\nThis will significantly narrow down possibilities for the next guess.\n\n<guess>shiny</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: shiny -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) Y(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the third guess ""shiny"":\n- S: x -> not in the word\n- H: x -> not in the word\n- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)\n- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter)\n- Y: - -> in the word but in the wrong position\n\nSo, from this feedback:\n- The secret word has the letter \'Y\' but not at position 5 (since it\'s marked as ""-"", meaning present but wrong position).\n- The letters S and H are not in the word.\n\nNow, combining with previous feedback:\n\nExcluded letters: A, C, E, O, P, R, T, S, H (from guesses 1, 2, and 3)\n\nConfirmed positions:\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: N\n\nAnd we know the word has Y, but not at position 5.\n\nSince Y is in the word but not at position 5, and the only positions left are 1, 2, and 5, but position 5 is not Y, so Y must be at position 1 or 2.\n\nPattern: _ _ I N _\n\nWe know Y is in the word and must be at position 1 or 2.\n\nAlso, the word does not contain: A, C, E, H, O, P, R, S, T.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (but Y is already known to be in the word, so we can use it, but we need to place it at position 1 or 2).\n\nWe must form a word that has Y at position 1 or 2, and I at 3, N at 4, and the fifth letter is unknown.\n\nAlso, the word must not contain the excluded letters.\n\nNow, for the fourth guess, we need to test possibilities for the remaining positions.\n\nWe know Y is at 1 or 2. We can try to fix Y at position 1 and see what words are possible, or at position 2.\n\nBut we need to make a guess that will help us distinguish.\n\nWe should also test other common letters for the remaining positions.\n\nLet\'s list possible words that fit the pattern and constraints.\n\nFirst, if Y is at position 1:\n- Pattern: Y _ I N _\n- The second letter can be one of the available letters, and the fifth letter one of the available letters, but not excluded.\n\nBut we have to avoid the excluded letters.\n\nSimilarly, if Y is at position 2:\n- Pattern: _ Y I N _\n\nNow, we need to choose a guess that can test both possibilities? Or we can commit to one and see.\n\nBut we have three positions to determine: 1, 2, and 5, but with Y being at 1 or 2, so if we fix Y at one position, we can test the other.\n\nWe can also choose a word that has Y at position 1 and then test common letters for 2 and 5, or vice versa.\n\nBut note: we have only 3 guesses left (since we are on guess 4 of 6).\n\nWe should try to cover as many letters as possible.\n\nSince Y is the only vowel we know besides I, and we have to have at least one more vowel? Not necessarily, but the word might have U or other.\n\nBut we have Y, so that\'s covered.\n\nNow, let\'s think of words that fit.\n\nFirst, with Y at position 1: Y _ I N _\n\nPossible words:\n- ""YOGIN"": but O is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YUKIN"": not a word? \n- ""YULIN"": not a common word? \n- ""YAPON"": A and O excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YAWIN"": A excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YUCKY"": but C and K? C is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YUCKS"": C and S excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YUGAS"": S excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YUKKY"": K and Y repeated? But K is allowed? But ""YUKKY"" is not a word? \n- ""YULAN"": A excluded -> invalid.\n- ""YUPON"": O and P excluded -> invalid.\n\nIt\'s hard to find words with Y at 1 and then a vowel? But we have U available.\n\n""YUMMY"": M and Y repeated? But ""YUMMY"" has Y at 1 and 5, and U at 2? Pattern: Y U M M Y -> but position 3 is M, but we need I at 3? No, position 3 must be I, so ""YUMMY"" doesn\'t have I at 3.\n\nWe need the third letter to be I.\n\nSo, for Y at 1: Y ? I N ?\n\nThe second letter must be a consonant or vowel that can form a word.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""YDI?"": not a word.\n- ""YF?"": not.\n\nActually, I can\'t think of many. Let me list valid English words.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""BEGIN"": but B E G I N -> E is excluded -> invalid.\n- ""BLUIN"": not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""LYING"": but we already guessed ""shiny"", and ""lying"" has Y at position 2? Not at 1.\n\nWith Y at 1, I think ""YOWIE"": but O and E excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUKON"": O excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUPON"": O and P excluded.\n\nIt seems difficult. Maybe Y at position 1 is not common.\n\nNow, with Y at position 2: _ Y I N _\n\nPattern: ? Y I N ?\n\nThis is more promising.\n\nFor example:\n- ""DYING"": D Y I N G -> this is a word. And D, G are not excluded? D and G are allowed.\n- ""FLYING"": F L Y I N G -> but that\'s 6 letters? No, ""FLYING"" is 6 letters. We need 5 letters.\n- ""TYING"": T excluded -> invalid.\n- ""LYING"": L Y I N G -> L, Y, I, N, G -> L and G allowed? Yes. And we haven\'t tested L or G.\n- ""VYING"": V Y I N G -> V is allowed? Yes. V, Y, I, N, G.\n- ""MYTHS"": but T and H excluded -> invalid.\n- ""GYPSY"": P and S excluded -> invalid.\n- ""BYLAW"": but A and W? A excluded -> invalid.\n- ""CYTON"": C excluded -> invalid.\n- ""GYNIC"": C excluded -> invalid.\n- ""SYNOD"": S and O excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo the common words with Y at position 2 and I at 3: ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".\n\nWe also have ""PYLON"", but P and O excluded.\n\n""HYMNS"": H excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo the candidates are: ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".\n\nNow, we also have the fifth letter to consider.\n\nIn ""DYING"": fifth letter is G.\nIn ""LYING"": fifth letter is G.\nIn ""VYING"": fifth letter is G.\n\nAll end with G? Not necessarily, but in these words they do.\n\nAre there others? ""MYN?"": not a word.\n\n""WYNDS"": but S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""XYST?"": not common.\n\nSo the main candidates are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".\n\nWe need to choose one to guess.\n\nBut note: we also have to consider that the fifth letter might not be G? But in the pattern, it could be something else.\n\nFor example, is there a word like ""XYLIC""? But C excluded and X Y L I C -> position 3 is L, not I? No.\n\nOr ""BYSSI"": S excluded and not I at 3.\n\nI think ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"" are the main ones.\n\nBut we know Y is in the word and not at position 5, so in these words, Y is at position 2, which is consistent.\n\nNow, for the guess, we can choose one of these to test.\n\nBut if we guess one of them and it\'s correct, we win. If not, we get feedback.\n\nBut we need to maximize information.\n\nWe have not tested D, L, V, or G yet.\n\nG is common, so if we guess one of these, we test G at position 5.\n\nBut if we guess ""DYING"", we test D at 1 and G at 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""LYING"" tests L at 1 and G at 5.\n\n""VYING"" tests V at 1 and G at 5.\n\nV is less common than D or L.\n\nSo we should choose between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"".\n\nD and L are both common.\n\nWe can choose ""LYING"" because L is slightly more common than D? Or D?\n\nLetter frequency: L is more common than D (L is 11th, D is 10th? Actually, D is 9th, L is 10th? Close).\n\nBut we can also consider that we might get information about the first letter.\n\nAnother thing: we know that the word has Y, so if we guess a word with Y at position 2, and if it\'s correct, we get confirmation.\n\nBut we already know Y is in the word, so the feedback will tell us if Y is at position 2 or not? Not exactly, because if we put Y at position 2 and it\'s correct, we get ✓, if not, we get - or x? But we know Y is in the word, so if we put it at position 2 and it\'s not there, we still get - meaning it\'s elsewhere, but we know it must be at position 1 or 2, so if it\'s not at 2, it must be at 1.\n\nSimilarly, if we put it at 1 and it\'s not there, it must be at 2.\n\nSo we can use the guess to pin down the position of Y.\n\nBut in this case, for the fourth guess, we can choose to put Y at position 1 or 2.\n\nBut earlier we saw that words with Y at 1 are rare, so it\'s more likely at 2.\n\nTherefore, we can guess one of ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".\n\nI think ""LYING"" is a good choice because L is common.\n\nBut we already have feedback that S and H are not in the word, so no issue.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that has Y at position 1 to test that possibility, but it might be hard to find.\n\nFor example, is there a word like ""YINCE""? Not a word.\n\n""YITIE""? Not.\n\n""YLIKE""? Not.\n\nI think it\'s safer to assume Y is at position 2.\n\nSo let\'s choose between ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".\n\n""VYING"" has V, which is less common, so we might avoid that.\n\nBetween ""DYING"" and ""LYING"", both are valid.\n\nWe can choose ""LYING"" because it uses L, which we haven\'t tested.\n\nBut we haven\'t tested D either.\n\nWe can also consider that in ""LYING"", if we guess it, and it\'s not correct, we get feedback on L and G.\n\nSimilarly for ""DYING"".\n\nBut note: we have to consider the fifth letter. In all these, it\'s G, so if G is not in the word, we know that none of these are the word, and Y must be at position 1? But we don\'t have a word for that.\n\nBut if G is not in the word, then we know the fifth letter is not G, and Y must be at position 1, and we need to find a word with Y at 1 and I at 3, N at 4, and a fifth letter.\n\nBut as we saw, such words are rare, so it might be that G is in the word.\n\nWe can also choose a word that has Y at position 1 to directly test that.\n\nFor example, is there a valid word with Y at 1? Let\'s search.\n\n""YCLAD"": C excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YDRAD"": not a word.\n\n""YFERE"": E excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YIKES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YIRTH"": H excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YLIKE"": not a word.\n\n""YMOLT"": O excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YMPES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YOGIN"": O excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YOKED"": O, E, D?

O excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YOURS"": O, U, R, S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YOWES"": O, E, S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YOWIE"": O, E, I? O and E excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YRApt"": not a word.\n\n""YRENT"": E excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YRIVD"": not a word.\n\n""YRNEH"": not a word.\n\n""YSLUM"": S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YTOST"": O and T excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUANS"": A, U, S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUCCH"": C and H excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUCKY"": C and K? C excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUGAS"": S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUKKY"": K excluded? K is allowed, but ""YUKKY"" is not a standard word? It might be slang, but let\'s avoid.\n\n""YULES"": E and S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""YUMMY"": M and Y repeated, and no I at 3 -> invalid.\n\n""YURTA"": U, R, T, A? A, R, T excluded -> invalid.\n\nI cannot find a valid 5-letter word with Y at position 1, I at 3, N at 4, and without excluded letters.\n\nTherefore, it is highly likely that Y is at position 2.\n\nSo the word must be of the form _ Y I N _\n\nAnd the candidates are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"", and possibly others with different fifth letters.\n\nBut earlier I thought of only those three, but is there a word with a different fifth letter?\n\nFor example, ""MYTHI"": H and T excluded -> invalid.\n\n""SYNCH"": S and H excluded -> invalid.\n\n""WYNDS"": S excluded -> invalid.\n\n""XYLIC"": C excluded -> invalid.\n\n""BYNIN"": not a word.\n\n""KYLIN"": K Y L I N -> but that\'s K at 1, Y at 2, L at 3? But we need I at 3, not L. ""KYLIN"" has I at position 4? K(1), Y(2), L(3), I(4), N(5) -> but we need I at 3 and N at 4, so position 4 is I, not N.

Z Y M I N -> Z(1), Y(2), M(3), I(4), N(5) -> again, I at 4, not 3.\n\nSo no, the only common words are ""DYING"", ""LYING"", ""VYING"".\n\nTherefore, we should guess one of these.\n\nNow, to choose, we can pick ""LYING"" because L is more common than D or V? L is more common than V, but D and L are close.\n\nSince we have three options, and we need to test, we can choose the most common one.\n\n""LYING"" is a very common word.\n\nWe can also consider that if we guess ""LYING"" and it\'s wrong, we get feedback on L and G.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nBut let\'s see the frequency: ""LYING"" is more common than ""DYING"" or ""VYING"".\n\n""DYING"" is also common.\n\nBut ""VYING"" is less common.\n\nSo between ""DYING"" and ""LYING"", I\'ll choose ""LYING"".\n\nSo the guess is ""LYING"".\n\nBut note: in ""LYING"", the letters are L, Y, I, N, G.\n\nWe know I and N are correct and in place.\n\nY is in the word but we are testing it at position 2.\n\nL is at position 1, G at position 5.\n\nIf the word is ""LYING"", we win.\n\nIf not, we get feedback on L and G.\n\nIf L is not in the word, then we know the first letter must be D or V (from the candidates).\n\nSimilarly, if G is not in the word, then none of the candidates are valid, but we know Y must be at position 2, so the fifth letter must be something else, but we don\'t have a candidate, so it might be a rare word.\n\nBut let\'s hope it\'s one of the common ones.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""LYING"".\n\n<guess>lying</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(✓), E(x)  \n  - **N** is in the word and correctly placed at position 4.  \n  - **C, R, A, E** are not in the word.  \n- **Guess 2: ""point""** → Feedback: P(x), O(x), I(✓), N(✓), T(x)  \n  - **I** is in the word and correctly placed at position 3.  \n  - **N** is confirmed again at position 4.  \n  - **P, O, T** are not in the word.  \n- **Guess 3: ""shiny""** → Feedback: S(x), H(x), I(✓), N(✓), Y(-)  \n  - **I** and **N** are confirmed at positions 3 and 4.  \n  - **S** and **H** are not in the word.  \n  - **Y** is in the word but not at position 5.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- **Secret word pattern**: `_ _ I N _` (positions: 1, 2, 3=I, 4=N, 5).  \n- **Excluded letters** (not in the word): A, C, E, H, O, P, R, S, T.  \n- **Confirmed letters in the word**: I, N, Y.  \n  - **Y** must be at position 1 or 2 (since it is in the word but not at position 5).  \n- **Available letters** (not tested or confirmed): B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z.  \n- **Key constraints**:  \n  - Position 1: Must be one of B, D, F, G, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (but Y could be here).  \n  - Position 2: Must be Y or another available letter (but Y must be at position 1 or 2).  \n  - Position 5: Must be one of the available letters.  \n\n### Strategy for the Next Guess:\n- **Goal**: Test the position of **Y** (position 1 or 2) and cover common consonants for the remaining positions.  \n- **Approach**:  \n  - Since **Y** must be at position 1 or 2, and no valid 5-letter words exist with **Y** at position 1 (based on pattern `Y _ I N _` and excluded letters), **Y** is likely at position 2.  \n  - Focus on words with the pattern `_ Y I N _` to test this.  \n  - Prioritize high-frequency consonants (e.g., L, D, G) for positions 1 and 5 to maximize information.  \n- **Word choice**: ""lying"" fits perfectly:  \n  - Pattern: `L Y I N G` → Tests **L** at position 1, **Y** at position 2, and **G** at position 5.  \n  - Uses distinct, untested letters (L, G) and confirms **Y** placement.  \n  - Avoids all excluded letters.  \n- **Why not other candidates?**  \n  - ""dying"" and ""vying"" are alternatives, but ""lying"" uses **L** (more common than **D** or **V**) and is a high-frequency word.  \n  - If ""lying"" is incorrect, feedback on **L** and **G** will quickly narrow possibilities (e.g., if **L** is absent, position 1 must be **D** or **V**; if **G** is absent, position 5 is another letter).\n\n<guess>lying</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)\nGuess 2: point -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)\nGuess 3: shiny -> FEEDBACK: S(x) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) Y(-)\nGuess 4: lying -> FEEDBACK: L(x) Y(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback from the fourth guess ""lying"":\n- L: x -> not in the word\n- Y: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter)\n- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)\n- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter)\n- G: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (5th letter)\n\nSo, summarizing the secret word:\n- Position 2: Y\n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: N\n- Position 5: G\n- Only position 1 is unknown.\n\nThe word is: ?

We are given feedback from the fifth guess ""dying"":
- D: x -> not in the word
- Y: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (2nd letter)
- I: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (3rd letter)
- N: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (4th letter)
- G: ✓ -> in the word and in the correct position (5th letter)

Therefore, the secret word is:
- Position 1: unknown, but D is excluded
- Position 2: Y
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: N
- Position 5: G

So the word is ? Y I N G

We know the first letter is not D, and from previous feedback, we have excluded:
- A, C, E, H, L, O, P, R, S, T, D

Total excluded letters: A, C, D, E, H, L, O, P, R, S, T

Available letters for position 1: B, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But Y is already at position 2, so we need to avoid repeating unless necessary, but there are no restrictions on repetition, so in theory, Y could be at position 1? But the word is ?YING, and if we have Y at position 1, it would be ""YYING"" which is not a valid English word. Similarly, G is at position 5, but at position 1: ""GYING"" is not a word.

Similarly, other letters.

Valid English words ending with ""YING"":
The only common 5-letter words ending with ""YING"" were ""dying"", ""lying"", ""vying"", ""eying"", ""tying"", ""hying"", ""sying"", etc.

But from exclusions:
- ""DYING"" we guessed and D is excluded -> not possible.
- ""LYING"" we guessed and L is excluded -> not possible.
- ""EYING"": E is excluded -> not possible.
- ""HYING"": H is excluded -> not possible.
- ""TYING"": T excluded -> not possible.
- ""SYING"": S excluded -> not possible.

The only remaining candidate is ""VYING"": V Y I N G

We haven't excluded V.

And V is available.

So the secret word must be ""VYING"".

Therefore, for the sixth guess, we must guess ""VYING"".

### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

#### 1. **Analyze Previous Feedback:**
   - **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: `C(x) R(x) A(x) N(✓) E(x)`  
     - `N` is confirmed at position 4.  
     - `C, R, A, E` are excluded (not in the word).  
   - **Guess 2: ""point""** → Feedback: `P(x) O(x) I(✓) N(✓) T(x)`  
     - `I` confirmed at position 3, `N` reconfirmed at position 4.  
     - `P, O, T` excluded.  
   - **Guess 3: ""shiny""** → Feedback: `S(x) H(x) I(✓) N(✓) Y(-)`  
     - `I` and `N` reconfirmed.  
     - `Y` is in the word but not at position 5 (wrong position).  
     - `S, H` excluded.  
   - **Guess 4: ""lying""** → Feedback: `L(x) Y(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)`  
     - `Y` confirmed at position 2, `I` at 3, `N` at 4, `G` at 5.  
     - `L` excluded.  
   - **Guess 5: ""dying""** → Feedback: `D(x) Y(✓) I(✓) N(✓) G(✓)`  
     - `Y, I, N, G` reconfirmed at positions 2, 3, 4, 5.
     - `D` excluded.

#### 2. **Current Deductions:**
   - **Confirmed pattern**: `[Position 1: ?] Y I N G` (`_ Y I N G`).  
     - Positions 2–5 are fully solved:  
       - Position 2: `Y`  
       - Position 3: `I`  
       - Position 4: `N`  
       - Position 5: `G`.  
   - **Excluded letters**: `A, C, D, E, H, L, O, P, R, S, T` (all absent from the word).  
     - Remaining possible letters for position 1: `B, F, G, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Z`.  
   - **Constraint**: The letter at position 1 must form a valid 5-letter English word ending in ""YING"".  

#### 3. **Evaluate Valid Candidates:**
   - Test all possible words fitting `_ Y I N G`:  
     - **""bying""**: Not a valid English word.  
     - **""fying""**: Not a word (e.g., ""flying"" is 6 letters).  
     - **""gying""**: Invalid (`G` repeated, not a standard word).  
     - **""jying""**: Not a word.  
     - **""kying""**: Not a word.  
     - **""mying""**: Not a word.  
     - **""qying""**: Not a word.  
     - **""uying""**: Not a word.  
     - **""vying""**: **Valid** (meaning ""competing eagerly""). Letter `V` is not excluded.  
     - **""wying""**: Not a word.  
     - **""xying""**: Not a word.  
     - **""zying""**: Not a word.  
   - **Conclusion**: ""vying"" is the **only valid candidate** remaining due to:  
     - Exclusion of all other letters (e.g., `D`, `L`, `T`, etc.).  
     - No other word fits the pattern and constraints.

#### 4. **Final Decision:**
   - Guess ""vying"" as the sixth and final attempt.  
   - Expected outcome: Correct based on deduction.
