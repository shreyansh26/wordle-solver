We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- The letters R and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

In ""crane"", R was in the 2nd position and E was in the 5th position. Since they are misplaced, R cannot be in the 2nd position and E cannot be in the 5th position.

We also know that the secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, A, N (since they are not in the word)
- Contains R and E (since they are in the word)
- Places R not in the 2nd position and E not in the 5th position.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use some of these.

We also know that R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We should avoid using the same positions for R and E.

Let me try to think of words that have R and E, and 3 new letters.

Some possibilities:
- ""ROBES"": R in 1st, E in 4th? But we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.
- ""TRIED"": R in 2nd? But wait, in our first guess R was in 2nd and it was wrong position. So if we put R in 2nd again, it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. We should avoid putting R in 2nd. Similarly, avoid E in 5th.

So let's avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E.

Possible words:
- ""RIPER"": But has two R's? And E in 4th. Also, we don't know about I and P. But note: we have only 5 letters and we need to use R and E. Also, we don't want to repeat letters unnecessarily because we want to test more letters.

But ""RIPER"" has two R's and the secret word might not have two R's. We don't know. It's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

So let's try to find a word with R, E, and three new distinct letters, and place R not in 2nd and E not in 5th.

Options:
- ""RODEO"": But has two O's and no E? Doesn't have E. So not.

- ""ROUSE"": R in 1st, O, U, S, E in 5th? But we cannot put E in 5th because the feedback said E is not in 5th. So avoid E in 5th.

- ""ROBES"": R in 1st, O, B, E in 4th, S. This seems okay: R in 1st (which is allowed), E in 4th (allowed). And we test O, B, S.

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters: C, A, N. ""ROBES"" doesn't have any of these.

Another option: ""TRIBE"" -> R in 2nd? We must avoid R in 2nd. So no.

""PRICE"": But has C? C is excluded. So no.

""DRIVE"": D, R in 2nd? Avoid R in 2nd.

""CREST"": But C is excluded.

""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E. R is in 4th position, E in 5th? But we cannot put E in 5th. So avoid.

""STARE"": But A is excluded.

""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E. But E is in 5th? Avoid.

We need E not in 5th. So let's look for words with E in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

Similarly, R in 1st, 3rd, 4th (avoid 2nd).

Let me try to list words with E in 1st to 4th and R in 1st,3rd,4th.

For example:
- ""RESET"": E in 1st and 3rd? But we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, S and T. But R is in 2nd? Avoid R in 2nd.

- ""REVEL"": R in 1st? Then E in 2nd and 4th? But again, two E's and R in 1st is okay. But we don't know about V and L.

But we want to test new letters.

Another: ""ROGUE"": R in 1st, O, G, U, E in 5th? Avoid E in 5th.

""RIDGE"": R in 1st, I, D, G, E in 5th? Avoid.

""RIFLE"": R in 1st, I, F, L, E in 5th? Avoid.

""RUMOR"": No E.

We need a word that has E in a position other than 5th.

How about ""ROUTE"": R in 1st, O, U, T, E in 5th? Avoid.

""RIPEN"": But N is excluded.

""RIPED"": Not a word? ""RIPED"" is not valid. The past tense is ""riped"" is not common, usually ""ripened"" but that's 7 letters.

Let's think of common words.

""ROBED"": R in 1st, O, B, E in 4th, D. This seems good: E is in 4th (allowed), R in 1st (allowed). Letters: R, O, B, E, D. All new except R and E, and no excluded letters.

But is ""ROBED"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to have put on robes.

Another option: ""ROLES"": R in 1st, O, L, E in 4th, S. E in 4th is allowed.

But we have two options: ""ROBED"" and ""ROLES"". Both are valid.

We could also consider ""RULES"": R in 1st, U, L, E in 4th, S.

But let's choose one that has common letters to test.

Alternatively, we can try to put R in a different position, not 1st, to get more information about R's position.

For example, put R in 3rd or 4th.

Similarly for E, put in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

Let me try to find a word with R in 3rd and E in 1st, for example.

""PERKY"": P, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, K, Y. But E in 1st is allowed. And R in 3rd is allowed. Letters: P, E, R, K, Y. All new and not excluded.

But we know E is in the word, so having E in 1st is okay.

Another: ""BERYL"": B, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, Y, L. But E in 1st? Actually, ""BERYL"" has E in 2nd? Let me spell: B-E-R-Y-L. So E in 2nd, R in 3rd. That's okay.

But we don't know about B, Y, L.

We can also consider ""TERSE"": T, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, S, E. But two E's? And E in 5th? The last E is in 5th, which we must avoid. So no.

""VERGE"": V, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, G, E in 5th? Avoid E in 5th.

""MERGE"": M, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, G, E in 5th? Avoid.

""JERKY"": J, E in 1st, R in 3rd, K, Y. This might be a good one: tests J, E, R, K, Y. But J is less common.

""FERAL"": F, E in 1st, R in 3rd, A? But A is excluded. So no.

""HERON"": H, E in 1st, R in 3rd, O, N? But N is excluded.

So it's tricky.

Another idea: ""ROBES"" as I thought earlier: R in 1st, O, B, E in 4th, S. This seems solid.

But let me check if there's a word with R in 4th and E in 2nd, for example.

""TORES"": T, O, R in 3rd? Then E in 4th? Wait, T-O-R-E-S. So R in 3rd, E in 4th. But E is in 4th, which is allowed. And R in 3rd is allowed. But we have S at the end. And we avoid E in 5th? Here E is in 4th, so okay.

But ""TORES"" has O, R, E, S, T. All new and not excluded.

Similarly, ""CORES"" has C? Excluded.

""PORES"": P, O, R in 3rd, E in 4th, S. This is good.

But we have two good candidates: ""ROBES"" and ""PORES"".

In ""ROBES"": R in 1st, O in 2nd, B in 3rd, E in 4th, S in 5th.
In ""PORES"": P in 1st, O in 2nd, R in 3rd, E in 4th, S in 5th.

We know that R is in the word but not in position 2, so in ""PORES"", R is in 3rd, which is a new position, so that might be better to test if R is in 3rd.

Similarly, E is in 4th in both, which is a new position (previously we had E in 5th, which was wrong).

In the first guess, E was in 5th and it was wrong, so E in 4th is a new position.

But we don't know if E can be in 4th or not.

I think ""PORES"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (3rd) and E in 4th, and we get to test P, O, S as well.

Another candidate: ""RIPES"" but R in 1st, I, P, E in 4th, S. But we have R in 1st, which we could test, but we already have a candidate with R in 1st.

But ""RIPES"" has I and P, which are new.

But I think ""PORES"" is better because it moves R to a different position.

We could also consider ""STREP"" but that's 5 letters? S-T-R-E-P. But ""strep"" is a valid word? It might be informal for streptococcus, but sometimes accepted. To be safe, let's stick to common words.

""PROSE"": P, R in 2nd? But we must avoid R in 2nd. So no.

""PRONE"": P, R in 2nd? Avoid.

""ROGUE"": E in 5th? Avoid.

So back to ""PORES"" or ""ROBES"".

I think I'll go with ""PORES"" because it tests R in position 3, which is a new position, and we avoid repeating the same position for R.

So my second guess: PORES

<guess>pores</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: not in word, R: in word but wrong position, A: not in word, N: not in word, E: in word but wrong position), the following is known:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively (since they were misplaced in ""crane"").
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word.
- The new guess must include R and E, avoid C, A, N, and place R in a position other than 2 and E in a position other than 5.
- To maximize information, the guess should use new letters and test R and E in new positions.

The word ""pores"" was chosen because:
- It includes R (in position 3, a new position to test) and E (in position 4, avoiding position 5).
- It introduces three new letters: P, O, S.
- It avoids excluded letters (C, A, N) and uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- Testing R in position 3 helps narrow down its correct placement, while E in position 4 provides new information.

<guess>pores</guess>",pores,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- The letters R and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

In ""crane"", R was in the 2nd position and E was in the 5th position. Since they are misplaced, R cannot be in the 2nd position and E cannot be in the 5th position.

We also know that the secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, A, N (since they are not in the word)
- Contains R and E (since they are in the word)
- Places R not in the 2nd position and E not in the 5th position.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use some of these.

We also know that R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We should avoid using the same positions for R and E.

Let me try to think of words that have R and E, and 3 new letters.

Some possibilities:
- ""ROBES"": R in 1st, E in 4th? But we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.
- ""TRIED"": R in 2nd? But wait, in our first guess R was in 2nd and it was wrong position. So if we put R in 2nd again, it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. We should avoid putting R in 2nd. Similarly, avoid E in 5th.

So let's avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E.

Possible words:
- ""RIPER"": But has two R's? And E in 4th. Also, we don't know about I and P. But note: we have only 5 letters and we need to use R and E. Also, we don't want to repeat letters unnecessarily because we want to test more letters.

But ""RIPER"" has two R's and the secret word might not have two R's. We don't know. It's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

So let's try to find a word with R, E, and three new distinct letters, and place R not in 2nd and E not in 5th.

Options:
- ""RODEO"": But has two O's and no E? Doesn't have E. So not.

- ""ROUSE"": R in 1st, O, U, S, E in 5th? But we cannot put E in 5th because the feedback said E is not in 5th. So avoid E in 5th.

- ""ROBES"": R in 1st, O, B, E in 4th, S. This seems okay: R in 1st (which is allowed), E in 4th (allowed). And we test O, B, S.

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters: C, A, N. ""ROBES"" doesn't have any of these.

""DRIVE"": D, R in 2nd? Avoid R in 2nd.

""CREST"": But C is excluded.

""STARE"": But A is excluded.

""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E. But E is in 5th? Avoid.

We need E not in 5th. So let's look for words with E in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

Similarly, R in 1st, 3rd, 4th (avoid 2nd).

Let me try to list words with E in 1st to 4th and R in 1st,3rd,4th.

For example:
- ""RESET"": E in 1st and 3rd? But we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, S and T. But R is in 2nd? Avoid R in 2nd.

- ""REVEL"": R in 1st? Then E in 2nd and 4th? But again, two E's and R in 1st is okay. But we don't know about V and L.

But we want to test new letters.

Another: ""ROGUE"": R in 1st, O, G, U, E in 5th? Avoid E in 5th.

""RIDGE"": R in 1st, I, D, G, E in 5th? Avoid.

""JERKY"": J, E in 1st, R in 3rd, K, Y. This might be a good one: tests J, E, R, K, Y. But J is less common.

""FERAL"": F, E in 1st, R in 3rd, A? But A is excluded. So no.

""HERON"": H, E in 1st, R in 3rd, O, N? But N is excluded.

So it's tricky.

But let me check if there's a word with R in 4th and E in 2nd, for example.

Similarly, ""CORES"" has C? Excluded.

""PORES"": P, O, R in 3rd, E in 4th, S. This is good.

But we have two good candidates: ""ROBES"" and ""PORES"".

""PRONE"": P, R in 2nd? Avoid.

""ROGUE"": E in 5th? Avoid.

So back to ""PORES"" or ""ROBES"".

I think I'll go with ""PORES"" because it tests R in position 3, which is a new position, and we avoid repeating the same position for R.

So my second guess: PORES

<guess>pores</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: not in word, R: in word but wrong position, A: not in word, N: not in word, E: in word but wrong position), the following is known:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively (since they were misplaced in ""crane"").
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word.
- The new guess must include R and E, avoid C, A, N, and place R in a position other than 2 and E in a position other than 5.
- To maximize information, the guess should use new letters and test R and E in new positions.

The word ""pores"" was chosen because:
- It includes R (in position 3, a new position to test) and E (in position 4, avoiding position 5).
- It introduces three new letters: P, O, S.
- It avoids excluded letters (C, A, N) and uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- Testing R in position 3 helps narrow down its correct placement, while E in position 4 provides new information.",Guess 2: pores -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓) S(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,utter,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- The letters R and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

In ""crane"", R was in the 2nd position and E was in the 5th position. Since they are misplaced, R cannot be in the 2nd position and E cannot be in the 5th position.

We also know that the secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, A, N (since they are not in the word)
- Contains R and E (since they are in the word)
- Places R not in the 2nd position and E not in the 5th position.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use some of these.

We also know that R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We should avoid using the same positions for R and E.

Let me try to think of words that have R and E, and 3 new letters.

Some possibilities:
- ""ROBES"": R in 1st, E in 4th? But we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.
- ""TRIED"": R in 2nd? But wait, in our first guess R was in 2nd and it was wrong position. So if we put R in 2nd again, it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. We should avoid putting R in 2nd. Similarly, avoid E in 5th.

So let's avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E.

Possible words:
- ""RIPER"": But has two R's? And E in 4th. Also, we don't know about I and P. But note: we have only 5 letters and we need to use R and E. Also, we don't want to repeat letters unnecessarily because we want to test more letters.

But ""RIPER"" has two R's and the secret word might not have two R's. We don't know. It's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

So let's try to find a word with R, E, and three new distinct letters, and place R not in 2nd and E not in 5th.

Options:
- ""RODEO"": But has two O's and no E? Doesn't have E. So not.

- ""ROUSE"": R in 1st, O, U, S, E in 5th? But we cannot put E in 5th because the feedback said E is not in 5th. So avoid E in 5th.

- ""ROBES"": R in 1st, O, B, E in 4th, S. This seems okay: R in 1st (which is allowed), E in 4th (allowed). And we test O, B, S.

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters: C, A, N. ""ROBES"" doesn't have any of these.

Another option: ""TRIBE"" -> R in 2nd? We must avoid R in 2nd. So no.

""PRICE"": But has C? C is excluded. So no.

""DRIVE"": D, R in 2nd? Avoid R in 2nd.

""CREST"": But C is excluded.

""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E. R is in 4th position, E in 5th? But we cannot put E in 5th. So avoid.

""STARE"": But A is excluded.

""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E. But E is in 5th? Avoid.

We need E not in 5th. So let's look for words with E in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

Similarly, R in 1st, 3rd, 4th (avoid 2nd).

Let me try to list words with E in 1st to 4th and R in 1st,3rd,4th.

For example:
- ""RESET"": E in 1st and 3rd? But we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, S and T. But R is in 2nd? Avoid R in 2nd.

- ""REVEL"": R in 1st? Then E in 2nd and 4th? But again, two E's and R in 1st is okay. But we don't know about V and L.

But we want to test new letters.

Another: ""ROGUE"": R in 1st, O, G, U, E in 5th? Avoid E in 5th.

""RIDGE"": R in 1st, I, D, G, E in 5th? Avoid.

""RIFLE"": R in 1st, I, F, L, E in 5th? Avoid.

""RUMOR"": No E.

We need a word that has E in a position other than 5th.

How about ""ROUTE"": R in 1st, O, U, T, E in 5th? Avoid.

""RIPEN"": But N is excluded.

""RIPED"": Not a word? ""RIPED"" is not valid. The past tense is ""riped"" is not common, usually ""ripened"" but that's 7 letters.

Let's think of common words.

""ROBED"": R in 1st, O, B, E in 4th, D. This seems good: E is in 4th (allowed), R in 1st (allowed). Letters: R, O, B, E, D. All new except R and E, and no excluded letters.

But is ""ROBED"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to have put on robes.

Another option: ""ROLES"": R in 1st, O, L, E in 4th, S. E in 4th is allowed.

But we have two options: ""ROBED"" and ""ROLES"". Both are valid.

We could also consider ""RULES"": R in 1st, U, L, E in 4th, S.

But let's choose one that has common letters to test.

Alternatively, we can try to put R in a different position, not 1st, to get more information about R's position.

For example, put R in 3rd or 4th.

Similarly for E, put in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

Let me try to find a word with R in 3rd and E in 1st, for example.

""PERKY"": P, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, K, Y. But E in 1st is allowed. And R in 3rd is allowed. Letters: P, E, R, K, Y. All new and not excluded.

But we know E is in the word, so having E in 1st is okay.

Another: ""BERYL"": B, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, Y, L. But E in 1st? Actually, ""BERYL"" has E in 2nd? Let me spell: B-E-R-Y-L. So E in 2nd, R in 3rd. That's okay.

But we don't know about B, Y, L.

We can also consider ""TERSE"": T, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, S, E. But two E's? And E in 5th? The last E is in 5th, which we must avoid. So no.

""VERGE"": V, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, G, E in 5th? Avoid E in 5th.

""MERGE"": M, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, G, E in 5th? Avoid.

""JERKY"": J, E in 1st, R in 3rd, K, Y. This might be a good one: tests J, E, R, K, Y. But J is less common.

""FERAL"": F, E in 1st, R in 3rd, A? But A is excluded. So no.

""HERON"": H, E in 1st, R in 3rd, O, N? But N is excluded.

So it's tricky.

Another idea: ""ROBES"" as I thought earlier: R in 1st, O, B, E in 4th, S. This seems solid.

But let me check if there's a word with R in 4th and E in 2nd, for example.

""TORES"": T, O, R in 3rd? Then E in 4th? Wait, T-O-R-E-S. So R in 3rd, E in 4th. But E is in 4th, which is allowed. And R in 3rd is allowed. But we have S at the end. And we avoid E in 5th? Here E is in 4th, so okay.

But ""TORES"" has O, R, E, S, T. All new and not excluded.

Similarly, ""CORES"" has C? Excluded.

""PORES"": P, O, R in 3rd, E in 4th, S. This is good.

But we have two good candidates: ""ROBES"" and ""PORES"".

In ""ROBES"": R in 1st, O in 2nd, B in 3rd, E in 4th, S in 5th.
In ""PORES"": P in 1st, O in 2nd, R in 3rd, E in 4th, S in 5th.

We know that R is in the word but not in position 2, so in ""PORES"", R is in 3rd, which is a new position, so that might be better to test if R is in 3rd.

Similarly, E is in 4th in both, which is a new position (previously we had E in 5th, which was wrong).

In the first guess, E was in 5th and it was wrong, so E in 4th is a new position.

But we don't know if E can be in 4th or not.

I think ""PORES"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (3rd) and E in 4th, and we get to test P, O, S as well.

Another candidate: ""RIPES"" but R in 1st, I, P, E in 4th, S. But we have R in 1st, which we could test, but we already have a candidate with R in 1st.

But ""RIPES"" has I and P, which are new.

But I think ""PORES"" is better because it moves R to a different position.

We could also consider ""STREP"" but that's 5 letters? S-T-R-E-P. But ""strep"" is a valid word? It might be informal for streptococcus, but sometimes accepted. To be safe, let's stick to common words.

""PROSE"": P, R in 2nd? But we must avoid R in 2nd. So no.

""PRONE"": P, R in 2nd? Avoid.

""ROGUE"": E in 5th? Avoid.

So back to ""PORES"" or ""ROBES"".

I think I'll go with ""PORES"" because it tests R in position 3, which is a new position, and we avoid repeating the same position for R.

So my second guess: PORES

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

So, from guess 1:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N
- R and E are in the word, but R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""pores""
- P: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from guess 2:
- Excluded letters: P, O, S (added to C, A, N from before)
- E is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, E is in position 4 (since in ""pores"", E is the 4th letter and got a check).

Also, R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was misplaced in position 3 of ""pores"").

Now, we know:
- E is fixed in position 4 (because we have E(✓) in the 4th position).
- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2). So R must be in position 1 or 5? But wait, positions are 1 to 5.

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

For R:
- Not in 2 (from ""crane"" position 2)
- Not in 3 (from ""pores"" position 3)

So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5? But position 4 is taken by E (we know E is fixed at position 4). So R cannot be in position 4 because E is there. Therefore, R must be in position 1 or 5.

But in the word, R and E are distinct, so position 4 is E, so R can only be in 1 or 5.

Also, we have excluded letters: C, A, N, P, O, S.

So the secret word has:
- E in position 4.
- R in position 1 or 5.
- And one more letter that we know: from guess 1, we have R and E, but we don't know about other letters.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we need to find the other three letters.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, P, O, S. So available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know R and E are in, but R is already accounted for).

But R is in the word, so we don't need to include it again if we are using it, but in the guess we have to include it if we are testing positions.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
- Have E in position 4 (since it's fixed).
- Include R, but place it in either position 1 or 5 to test which one it is.
- Use only letters that are not excluded, so avoid C, A, N, P, O, S.
- Also, we want to test other letters to find the remaining three.

The secret word has E in 4, R in 1 or 5, and three other letters from the available set.

We have two cases for R: either in 1 or in 5.

We can design a guess that tests one of these cases and also tests new letters.

For example, if we put R in position 1, then we can have a word like R _ _ E _, with the middle letters being new.

Similarly, if we put R in position 5, we have _ _ _ E R.

But we don't know which one, so we might choose one to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in position 1 and also tests other possibilities, or in position 5.

But we have to make a valid word.

Also, we have only 4 guesses left (since 2 used, total 6).

Let me list possible words that have E in position 4 and R in position 1 or 5.

First, with R in position 1 and E in 4: R ? ? E ?

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common words:
- ""RULER"": But L and E? R U L E R? That has two R's? And E in 4th. But we have excluded S, but L and U are available. However, ""RULER"" has R at the end too? Positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R. But we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are testing R in position 1 and 5? But we only need one R, but if the word has two, it's possible. But let's see feedback: we know E is in 4, so that's fixed. But if we guess ""RULER"", and the secret has only one R, it might be confusing.

But we don't know the letter counts. So it's risky.

- ""RIVER"": R I V E R? Again, two R's and E in 4th. Same issue.

- ""RIDER"": R I D E R? Two R's.

- ""RARER"": Multiple R's.

It might be hard to avoid if we put R at start and end.

What about words with R at 1 and E at 4, but no R at 5? For example, ""RIPEN"" but N is excluded.

""RIPED"" not a word.

""RICES"" but C and S excluded.

""RIFLE"": R I F L E? But E is in 5th? In ""RIFLE"", positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:F, 4:L, 5:E. But we need E in 4th, not 5th. Here E is in 5th, which we cannot do because we know E is fixed at 4.

We need E in position 4.

So the word must have the form: ? ? ? E ? with E in the fourth position.

For R in position 1: R ? ? E ?

For R in position 5: ? ? ? E R

Now, let's find words without excluded letters.

First, with R in 1: R ? ? E ?

Possible words:
- ""RUBLE"": R U B L E? But E is in 5th? 1:R,2:U,3:B,4:L,5:E -> E is in 5th, not 4th. We need the fourth letter to be E, so ""RUBLE"" has L in 4th and E in 5th, not good.

- ""RUMBLE"" is 6 letters.

- ""RIPED"" not valid.

- ""RIDGE"": R I D G E -> 1:R,2:I,3:D,4:G,5:E -> E in 5th, not 4th.

- ""RIFLE"": same, E in 5th.

- ""RUBLE"": same.

It seems difficult to have E in 4th with R in 1st because many words end with E.

What about ""RAREE""? Not common.

""RAMEE""? Not common.

Perhaps ""REBEL"": R E B E L? But E in 2nd and 4th? 1:R,2:E,3:B,4:E,5:L. So E is in 4th? Position 4 is E, yes. And position 2 is also E. So it has two E's? But we don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, we have E in 4th, which is fixed. But in this case, for ""REBEL"", we have E in 2nd and 4th.

But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are multiple.

But let's see: available letters, B and L are not excluded.

But we have E in 2nd, which we don't know about.

But we are trying to test R in 1st.

Similarly, ""ROWED"": but O excluded, and E in 4th? R O W E D -> 1:R,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:D. O is excluded, so not allowed.

""RACED"": C and A excluded.

So hard to find a word with R in 1 and E in 4.

Perhaps ""RIPEN"" but N excluded.

Another idea: ""RHEUM"" but E in 3rd? Not 4th.

Maybe we should consider R in position 5.

So form: ? ? ? E R

With E in 4 and R in 5.

Then the first three letters are from available set.

Common words:
- ""USHER"": U S H E R -> but S is excluded, and E in 4, R in 5. S excluded, so no.
- ""OTHER"": O T H E R -> O excluded.
- ""LATER"": L A T E R -> A excluded.
- ""METER"": M E T E R -> E in 2nd and 4th? 1:M,2:E,3:T,4:E,5:R. So E in 4th and R in 5th. But E is in 2nd as well. Available letters: M, T, E, R. E and R are known, M and T not excluded.
- ""METER"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""PETER"": P excluded.

""REFER"": R E F E R -> 1:R,2:E,3:F,4:E,5:R. But R in 1st and 5th, E in 2nd and 4th. But we have E in 4th, which is good, but we are testing R in 5th, but also R in 1st? And we don't know counts.

But ""METER"" might be acceptable.

Another: ""TIGER"": T I G E R -> 1:T,2:I,3:G,4:E,5:R. E in 4th, R in 5th. T, I, G not excluded.

""TIGER"" is a good word.

Similarly, ""RIDER"" has two R's and E not in 4th.

""TIGER"" has T, I, G, E, R.

E in 4th, R in 5th.

We can also consider ""HYPER"": H Y P E R -> but P excluded.

""CYBER"": C excluded.

""BOXER"": O excluded.

So ""TIGER"" is a candidate.

Another: ""LIVER"": L I V E R -> E in 4th? 1:L,2:I,3:V,4:E,5:R. Yes, and L, I, V not excluded.

""RIVER"" has R in 1st, which we might not want to test yet.

But in ""LIVER"", R is in 5th, which is one of the possibilities.

Similarly, ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> O excluded.

""HAZER"": H A Z E R -> A excluded.

""FEWER"": F E W E R -> E in 2nd and 4th, R in 5th. 1:F,2:E,3:W,4:E,5:R. E in 4th, so good. F, W not excluded.

But two E's.

We can choose ""TIGER"" or ""LIVER"".

Now, back to the case with R in 1st: we had trouble finding a word, but let's try ""REEDY"": R E E D Y -> 1:R,2:E,3:E,4:D,5:Y. But E is in 2nd and 3rd, and position 4 is D, not E. We need position 4 to be E.

""REBUS"": S excluded.

""RELIC"": R E L I C -> C excluded.

""REMIT"": R E M I T -> E in 2nd, not 4th.

It seems that having R in 1st and E in 4th is rare because the word would have to have a vowel or something in between.

""RABBI"": A and B? But A excluded, and E not present.

Perhaps ""ROUGE"": O and E in 5th? Not.

I think it's easier to go with R in 5th for now.

So let's choose a word with E in 4th and R in 5th, and three new letters.

For example, ""TIGER"": T in 1st, I in 2nd, G in 3rd, E in 4th, R in 5th.

This tests T, I, G in positions 1,2,3, and confirms if R is in 5th.

If R is in 5th, then we get R(✓) in 5th, and we know E is already ✓ in 4th.

If not, then R must be in 1st, and we'll know from the feedback.

In this guess, if R is not in 5th, then we will get R(-) or R(x)? But we know R is in the word, so if not in 5th, it must be misplaced, but since position 1,2,3 are occupied by T,I,G, if R is not in 5th, it might show as - in one of the first three? But we have only three positions.

The word has positions 1:T, 2:I, 3:G, 4:E, 5:R.

We know E is fixed at 4, so E will be ✓.

R is in 5th, so if the secret has R in 5th, we get ✓ for R.

If the secret has R in 1st, then in this guess, R is in 5th, which is wrong position, so we would get R(-) for position 5, and also, since R is in the word but not here, it might be in position 1, but position 1 has T, which might be x or something.

Let's simulate:

Case 1: secret has R in 5th.
Then feedback: T (x or -), I (x or -), G (x or -), E(✓), R(✓)

Case 2: secret has R in 1st (and not in 5th).
Then feedback: T (x or -), but R is in 1st, so for position 1, T is not R, so if T is not in word, x, or if T is in word but wrong position, -.
Similarly for I and G.
E(✓)
R is in 5th, but secret has R in 1st, so R is in the word but not in position 5, so we get R(-) for position 5.

Also, since R is in 1st, and we have T in 1st, if T is not R, which it isn't, so position 1: if T is not in word, x; if T is in word but not position 1, -.

But we don't know about T.

Similarly, if R is in 1st, then in the secret word, position 1 is R, so our guess has T in 1st, which is wrong, so we get x or - for T.

But we will get the feedback.

Moreover, by testing R in 5th, we can confirm or rule out that position.

We also test three new letters: T, I, G.

Another candidate: ""LIVER"": L in 1st, I in 2nd, V in 3rd, E in 4th, R in 5th.

Similarly, ""FIGHT"" no E.

""WIDEN"" but N excluded.

""QUEUE"" not.

I think ""TIGER"" is fine.

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Another word: ""DINER"": D I N E R -> but N excluded.

""FILER"": F I L E R -> E in 4th, R in 5th. F, I, L not excluded.

""FILER"" is a word, meaning one that files.

Similarly, ""TIMER"": T I M E R -> M not excluded.

""TIMER"" is good.

But ""TIGER"" is more common.

We can choose ""TIMER"" to test M instead of G.

But G and M are both plausible.

Since we have E fixed at 4, and we need to find R's position, let's go with ""TIGER"".

So guess: TIGER

But in ""TIGER"", we have E in 4th and R in 5th.

We know E is fixed at 4, so that will be ✓.

R in 5th: if it's correct, ✓; if not, -.

Also, we test T, I, G.

If R is not in 5th, then it must be in 1st, and we'll know for the next guess.

Moreover, if we get T, I, or G as present, we get more information.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: TIGER

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C, A, N are not in the word.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""pores""**  
  Feedback: P(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓) S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - P, O, S are not in the word.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - E is in the word and correctly placed in position 4.  

### Current Knowledge
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
  - E is fixed in position 4 (from ""pores"" feedback).  
- **Confirmed present but misplaced**:  
  - R is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""crane"" and ""pores""). Since E occupies position 4, R must be in position 1 or 5.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, P, O, S (not in the word).  
- **Available letters**: All letters except excluded ones (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
- **Word structure**: The secret word has the form `[letter1][letter2][letter3]E[letter5]`, with R in position 1 or 5.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Resolve R's position (1 or 5) while testing new letters for the remaining positions.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Place E in position 4 (fixed).  
  - Test R in position 5 to check if it is correct (if not, R must be in position 1).  
  - Use new, common letters for positions 1, 2, and 3 to maximize information.  
  - Avoid excluded letters.  
- **Chosen word: ""tiger""**  
  - Structure: T (position 1), I (position 2), G (position 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
  - Why ""tiger""?  
    - Tests R in position 5: If R is correct here, we confirm position 5. If not, R must be in position 1 (and we get a misplaced indicator).  
    - Tests three new letters (T, I, G) in positions 1–3.  
    - Uses common letters to cover frequent possibilities.  
    - Avoids excluded letters and repeats.  
  - Expected outcomes:  
    - If R is in position 5, feedback will show R(✓).  
    - If R is not in position 5, feedback will show R(-), confirming R is in position 1.  
    - Feedback for T, I, G will reveal if any are in the word and their positions.  

<guess>tiger</guess>",tiger,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

So, from guess 1:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N
- R and E are in the word, but R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""pores""
- P: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from guess 2:
- Excluded letters: P, O, S (added to C, A, N from before)
- E is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, E is in position 4 (since in ""pores"", E is the 4th letter and got a check).

Also, R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was misplaced in position 3 of ""pores"").

Now, we know:
- E is fixed in position 4 (because we have E(✓) in the 4th position).
- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2). So R must be in position 1 or 5? But wait, positions are 1 to 5.

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

For R:
- Not in 2 (from ""crane"" position 2)
- Not in 3 (from ""pores"" position 3)

So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5? But position 4 is taken by E (we know E is fixed at position 4). So R cannot be in position 4 because E is there. Therefore, R must be in position 1 or 5.

But in the word, R and E are distinct, so position 4 is E, so R can only be in 1 or 5.

Also, we have excluded letters: C, A, N, P, O, S.

So the secret word has:
- E in position 4.
- R in position 1 or 5.
- And one more letter that we know: from guess 1, we have R and E, but we don't know about other letters.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we need to find the other three letters.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, P, O, S. So available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know R and E are in, but R is already accounted for).

But R is in the word, so we don't need to include it again if we are using it, but in the guess we have to include it if we are testing positions.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
- Have E in position 4 (since it's fixed).
- Include R, but place it in either position 1 or 5 to test which one it is.
- Use only letters that are not excluded, so avoid C, A, N, P, O, S.
- Also, we want to test other letters to find the remaining three.

The secret word has E in 4, R in 1 or 5, and three other letters from the available set.

We have two cases for R: either in 1 or in 5.

We can design a guess that tests one of these cases and also tests new letters.

For example, if we put R in position 1, then we can have a word like R _ _ E _, with the middle letters being new.

Similarly, if we put R in position 5, we have _ _ _ E R.

But we don't know which one, so we might choose one to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in position 1 and also tests other possibilities, or in position 5.

But we have to make a valid word.

Also, we have only 4 guesses left (since 2 used, total 6).

Let me list possible words that have E in position 4 and R in position 1 or 5.

First, with R in position 1 and E in 4: R ? ? E ?

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common words:
- ""RULER"": But L and E? R U L E R? That has two R's? And E in 4th. But we have excluded S, but L and U are available. However, ""RULER"" has R at the end too? Positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R. But we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are testing R in position 1 and 5? But we only need one R, but if the word has two, it's possible. But let's see feedback: we know E is in 4, so that's fixed. But if we guess ""RULER"", and the secret has only one R, it might be confusing.

But we don't know the letter counts. So it's risky.

- ""RIVER"": R I V E R? Again, two R's and E in 4th. Same issue.

- ""RIDER"": R I D E R? Two R's.

- ""RARER"": Multiple R's.

It might be hard to avoid if we put R at start and end.

What about words with R at 1 and E at 4, but no R at 5? For example, ""RIPEN"" but N is excluded.

""RIPED"" not a word.

""RICES"" but C and S excluded.

""RIFLE"": R I F L E? But E is in 5th? In ""RIFLE"", positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:F, 4:L, 5:E. But we need E in 4th, not 5th. Here E is in 5th, which we cannot do because we know E is fixed at 4.

We need E in position 4.

So the word must have the form: ? ? ? E ? with E in the fourth position.

For R in position 1: R ? ? E ?

For R in position 5: ? ? ? E R

Now, let's find words without excluded letters.

First, with R in 1: R ? ? E ?

Possible words:
- ""RUBLE"": R U B L E? But E is in 5th? 1:R,2:U,3:B,4:L,5:E -> E is in 5th, not 4th. We need the fourth letter to be E, so ""RUBLE"" has L in 4th and E in 5th, not good.

- ""RUMBLE"" is 6 letters.

- ""RIPED"" not valid.

- ""RIDGE"": R I D G E -> 1:R,2:I,3:D,4:G,5:E -> E in 5th, not 4th.

- ""RIFLE"": same, E in 5th.

- ""RUBLE"": same.

It seems difficult to have E in 4th with R in 1st because many words end with E.

What about ""RAREE""? Not common.

""RAMEE""? Not common.

Perhaps ""REBEL"": R E B E L? But E in 2nd and 4th? 1:R,2:E,3:B,4:E,5:L. So E is in 4th? Position 4 is E, yes. And position 2 is also E. So it has two E's? But we don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, we have E in 4th, which is fixed. But in this case, for ""REBEL"", we have E in 2nd and 4th.

But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are multiple.

But let's see: available letters, B and L are not excluded.

But we have E in 2nd, which we don't know about.

But we are trying to test R in 1st.

Similarly, ""ROWED"": but O excluded, and E in 4th? R O W E D -> 1:R,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:D. O is excluded, so not allowed.

""RACED"": C and A excluded.

So hard to find a word with R in 1 and E in 4.

Perhaps ""RIPEN"" but N excluded.

Another idea: ""RHEUM"" but E in 3rd? Not 4th.

Maybe we should consider R in position 5.

So form: ? ? ? E R

With E in 4 and R in 5.

Then the first three letters are from available set.

Common words:
- ""USHER"": U S H E R -> but S is excluded, and E in 4, R in 5. S excluded, so no.
- ""OTHER"": O T H E R -> O excluded.
- ""LATER"": L A T E R -> A excluded.
- ""METER"": M E T E R -> E in 2nd and 4th? 1:M,2:E,3:T,4:E,5:R. So E in 4th and R in 5th. But E is in 2nd as well. Available letters: M, T, E, R. E and R are known, M and T not excluded.
- ""METER"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""PETER"": P excluded.

""REFER"": R E F E R -> 1:R,2:E,3:F,4:E,5:R. But R in 1st and 5th, E in 2nd and 4th. But we have E in 4th, which is good, but we are testing R in 5th, but also R in 1st? And we don't know counts.

But ""METER"" might be acceptable.

Another: ""TIGER"": T I G E R -> 1:T,2:I,3:G,4:E,5:R. E in 4th, R in 5th. T, I, G not excluded.

""TIGER"" is a good word.

Similarly, ""RIDER"" has two R's and E not in 4th.

""TIGER"" has T, I, G, E, R.

E in 4th, R in 5th.

We can also consider ""HYPER"": H Y P E R -> but P excluded.

""CYBER"": C excluded.

""BOXER"": O excluded.

So ""TIGER"" is a candidate.

Another: ""LIVER"": L I V E R -> E in 4th? 1:L,2:I,3:V,4:E,5:R. Yes, and L, I, V not excluded.

""RIVER"" has R in 1st, which we might not want to test yet.

But in ""LIVER"", R is in 5th, which is one of the possibilities.

Similarly, ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> O excluded.

""HAZER"": H A Z E R -> A excluded.

""FEWER"": F E W E R -> E in 2nd and 4th, R in 5th. 1:F,2:E,3:W,4:E,5:R. E in 4th, so good. F, W not excluded.

But two E's.

We can choose ""TIGER"" or ""LIVER"".

Now, back to the case with R in 1st: we had trouble finding a word, but let's try ""REEDY"": R E E D Y -> 1:R,2:E,3:E,4:D,5:Y. But E is in 2nd and 3rd, and position 4 is D, not E. We need position 4 to be E.

""REBUS"": S excluded.

""RELIC"": R E L I C -> C excluded.

""REMIT"": R E M I T -> E in 2nd, not 4th.

It seems that having R in 1st and E in 4th is rare because the word would have to have a vowel or something in between.

""RABBI"": A and B? But A excluded, and E not present.

Perhaps ""ROUGE"": O and E in 5th? Not.

I think it's easier to go with R in 5th for now.

So let's choose a word with E in 4th and R in 5th, and three new letters.

For example, ""TIGER"": T in 1st, I in 2nd, G in 3rd, E in 4th, R in 5th.

This tests T, I, G in positions 1,2,3, and confirms if R is in 5th.

If R is in 5th, then we get R(✓) in 5th, and we know E is already ✓ in 4th.

If not, then R must be in 1st, and we'll know from the feedback.

In this guess, if R is not in 5th, then we will get R(-) or R(x)? But we know R is in the word, so if not in 5th, it must be misplaced, but since position 1,2,3 are occupied by T,I,G, if R is not in 5th, it might show as - in one of the first three? But we have only three positions.

The word has positions 1:T, 2:I, 3:G, 4:E, 5:R.

We know E is fixed at 4, so E will be ✓.

R is in 5th, so if the secret has R in 5th, we get ✓ for R.

If the secret has R in 1st, then in this guess, R is in 5th, which is wrong position, so we would get R(-) for position 5, and also, since R is in the word but not here, it might be in position 1, but position 1 has T, which might be x or something.

Let's simulate:

Case 1: secret has R in 5th.
Then feedback: T (x or -), I (x or -), G (x or -), E(✓), R(✓)

Case 2: secret has R in 1st (and not in 5th).
Then feedback: T (x or -), but R is in 1st, so for position 1, T is not R, so if T is not in word, x, or if T is in word but wrong position, -.
Similarly for I and G.
E(✓)
R is in 5th, but secret has R in 1st, so R is in the word but not in position 5, so we get R(-) for position 5.

Also, since R is in 1st, and we have T in 1st, if T is not R, which it isn't, so position 1: if T is not in word, x; if T is in word but not position 1, -.

But we don't know about T.

Similarly, if R is in 1st, then in the secret word, position 1 is R, so our guess has T in 1st, which is wrong, so we get x or - for T.

But we will get the feedback.

Moreover, by testing R in 5th, we can confirm or rule out that position.

We also test three new letters: T, I, G.

Another candidate: ""LIVER"": L in 1st, I in 2nd, V in 3rd, E in 4th, R in 5th.

Similarly, ""FIGHT"" no E.

""WIDEN"" but N excluded.

""QUEUE"" not.

I think ""TIGER"" is fine.

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Another word: ""DINER"": D I N E R -> but N excluded.

""FILER"": F I L E R -> E in 4th, R in 5th. F, I, L not excluded.

""FILER"" is a word, meaning one that files.

Similarly, ""TIMER"": T I M E R -> M not excluded.

""TIMER"" is good.

But ""TIGER"" is more common.

We can choose ""TIMER"" to test M instead of G.

But G and M are both plausible.

Since we have E fixed at 4, and we need to find R's position, let's go with ""TIGER"".

So guess: TIGER

But in ""TIGER"", we have E in 4th and R in 5th.

We know E is fixed at 4, so that will be ✓.

R in 5th: if it's correct, ✓; if not, -.

Also, we test T, I, G.

If R is not in 5th, then it must be in 1st, and we'll know for the next guess.

Moreover, if we get T, I, or G as present, we get more information.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: TIGER

<guess>tiger</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C, A, N are not in the word.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""pores""**  
  Feedback: P(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓) S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - P, O, S are not in the word.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - E is in the word and correctly placed in position 4.  

### Current Knowledge
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
  - E is fixed in position 4 (from ""pores"" feedback).  
- **Confirmed present but misplaced**:  
  - R is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""crane"" and ""pores""). Since E occupies position 4, R must be in position 1 or 5.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, P, O, S (not in the word).  
- **Available letters**: All letters except excluded ones (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
- **Word structure**: The secret word has the form `[letter1][letter2][letter3]E[letter5]`, with R in position 1 or 5.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Resolve R's position (1 or 5) while testing new letters for the remaining positions.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Place E in position 4 (fixed).  
  - Test R in position 5 to check if it is correct (if not, R must be in position 1).  
  - Use new, common letters for positions 1, 2, and 3 to maximize information.  
  - Avoid excluded letters.  
- **Chosen word: ""tiger""**  
  - Structure: T (position 1), I (position 2), G (position 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
  - Why ""tiger""?  
    - Tests R in position 5: If R is correct here, we confirm position 5. If not, R must be in position 1 (and we get a misplaced indicator).  
    - Tests three new letters (T, I, G) in positions 1–3.  
    - Uses common letters to cover frequent possibilities.  
    - Avoids excluded letters and repeats.  
  - Expected outcomes:  
    - If R is in position 5, feedback will show R(✓).  
    - If R is not in position 5, feedback will show R(-), confirming R is in position 1.  
    - Feedback for T, I, G will reveal if any are in the word and their positions.",Guess 3: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(-) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.

 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 I will choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
C: x (not in the word)
R: - (in the word but wrong position)
A: x (not in the word)
N: x (not in the word)
E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, we know:
- The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word.
- The letters R and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

In ""crane"", R was in the 2nd position and E was in the 5th position. Since they are misplaced, R cannot be in the 2nd position and E cannot be in the 5th position.

We also know that the secret word contains R and E, and does not contain C, A, N.

We have 6 tries, and this is our second guess.

We need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
- Does not contain C, A, N (since they are not in the word)
- Contains R and E (since they are in the word)
- Places R not in the 2nd position and E not in the 5th position.

Additionally, we want to maximize information by trying new letters and positions.

Let's think of words that have R and E, and avoid C, A, N.

Common letters we haven't tried: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We can try to use some of these.

We also know that R is in the word but not in position 2. So R could be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.
Similarly, E is in the word but not in position 5, so E could be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We should avoid using the same positions for R and E.

Let me try to think of words that have R and E, and 3 new letters.

Some possibilities:
- ""ROBES"": R in 1st, E in 4th? But we don't know if O, B, S are in the word.
- ""TRIED"": R in 2nd? But wait, in our first guess R was in 2nd and it was wrong position. So if we put R in 2nd again, it would be the same position and we know it's wrong. We should avoid putting R in 2nd. Similarly, avoid E in 5th.

So let's avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E.

Possible words:
- ""RIPER"": But has two R's? And E in 4th. Also, we don't know about I and P. But note: we have only 5 letters and we need to use R and E. Also, we don't want to repeat letters unnecessarily because we want to test more letters.

But ""RIPER"" has two R's and the secret word might not have two R's. We don't know. It's better to use distinct letters to maximize information.

So let's try to find a word with R, E, and three new distinct letters, and place R not in 2nd and E not in 5th.

Options:
- ""RODEO"": But has two O's and no E? Doesn't have E. So not.

- ""ROUSE"": R in 1st, O, U, S, E in 5th? But we cannot put E in 5th because the feedback said E is not in 5th. So avoid E in 5th.

- ""ROBES"": R in 1st, O, B, E in 4th, S. This seems okay: R in 1st (which is allowed), E in 4th (allowed). And we test O, B, S.

But wait, we have to make sure we don't use any of the excluded letters: C, A, N. ""ROBES"" doesn't have any of these.

Another option: ""TRIBE"" -> R in 2nd? We must avoid R in 2nd. So no.

""PRICE"": But has C? C is excluded. So no.

""DRIVE"": D, R in 2nd? Avoid R in 2nd.

""CREST"": But C is excluded.

""STORE"": S, T, O, R, E. R is in 4th position, E in 5th? But we cannot put E in 5th. So avoid.

""STARE"": But A is excluded.

""STOLE"": S, T, O, L, E. But E is in 5th? Avoid.

We need E not in 5th. So let's look for words with E in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

Similarly, R in 1st, 3rd, 4th (avoid 2nd).

Let me try to list words with E in 1st to 4th and R in 1st,3rd,4th.

For example:
- ""RESET"": E in 1st and 3rd? But we don't know if the word has two E's. Also, S and T. But R is in 2nd? Avoid R in 2nd.

- ""REVEL"": R in 1st? Then E in 2nd and 4th? But again, two E's and R in 1st is okay. But we don't know about V and L.

But we want to test new letters.

Another: ""ROGUE"": R in 1st, O, G, U, E in 5th? Avoid E in 5th.

""RIDGE"": R in 1st, I, D, G, E in 5th? Avoid.

""RIFLE"": R in 1st, I, F, L, E in 5th? Avoid.

""RUMOR"": No E.

We need a word that has E in a position other than 5th.

How about ""ROUTE"": R in 1st, O, U, T, E in 5th? Avoid.

""RIPEN"": But N is excluded.

""RIPED"": Not a word? ""RIPED"" is not valid. The past tense is ""riped"" is not common, usually ""ripened"" but that's 7 letters.

Let's think of common words.

""ROBED"": R in 1st, O, B, E in 4th, D. This seems good: E is in 4th (allowed), R in 1st (allowed). Letters: R, O, B, E, D. All new except R and E, and no excluded letters.

But is ""ROBED"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to have put on robes.

Another option: ""ROLES"": R in 1st, O, L, E in 4th, S. E in 4th is allowed.

But we have two options: ""ROBED"" and ""ROLES"". Both are valid.

We could also consider ""RULES"": R in 1st, U, L, E in 4th, S.

But let's choose one that has common letters to test.

Alternatively, we can try to put R in a different position, not 1st, to get more information about R's position.

For example, put R in 3rd or 4th.

Similarly for E, put in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.

Let me try to find a word with R in 3rd and E in 1st, for example.

""PERKY"": P, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, K, Y. But E in 1st is allowed. And R in 3rd is allowed. Letters: P, E, R, K, Y. All new and not excluded.

But we know E is in the word, so having E in 1st is okay.

Another: ""BERYL"": B, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, Y, L. But E in 1st? Actually, ""BERYL"" has E in 2nd? Let me spell: B-E-R-Y-L. So E in 2nd, R in 3rd. That's okay.

But we don't know about B, Y, L.

We can also consider ""TERSE"": T, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, S, E. But two E's? And E in 5th? The last E is in 5th, which we must avoid. So no.

""VERGE"": V, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, G, E in 5th? Avoid E in 5th.

""MERGE"": M, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, G, E in 5th? Avoid.

""JERKY"": J, E in 1st, R in 3rd, K, Y. This might be a good one: tests J, E, R, K, Y. But J is less common.

""FERAL"": F, E in 1st, R in 3rd, A? But A is excluded. So no.

""HERON"": H, E in 1st, R in 3rd, O, N? But N is excluded.

So it's tricky.

Another idea: ""ROBES"" as I thought earlier: R in 1st, O, B, E in 4th, S. This seems solid.

But let me check if there's a word with R in 4th and E in 2nd, for example.

""TORES"": T, O, R in 3rd? Then E in 4th? Wait, T-O-R-E-S. So R in 3rd, E in 4th. But E is in 4th, which is allowed. And R in 3rd is allowed. But we have S at the end. And we avoid E in 5th? Here E is in 4th, so okay.

But ""TORES"" has O, R, E, S, T. All new and not excluded.

Similarly, ""CORES"" has C? Excluded.

""PORES"": P, O, R in 3rd, E in 4th, S. This is good.

But we have two good candidates: ""ROBES"" and ""PORES"".

In ""ROBES"": R in 1st, O in 2nd, B in 3rd, E in 4th, S in 5th.
In ""PORES"": P in 1st, O in 2nd, R in 3rd, E in 4th, S in 5th.

We know that R is in the word but not in position 2, so in ""PORES"", R is in 3rd, which is a new position, so that might be better to test if R is in 3rd.

Similarly, E is in 4th in both, which is a new position (previously we had E in 5th, which was wrong).

In the first guess, E was in 5th and it was wrong, so E in 4th is a new position.

But we don't know if E can be in 4th or not.

I think ""PORES"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (3rd) and E in 4th, and we get to test P, O, S as well.

Another candidate: ""RIPES"" but R in 1st, I, P, E in 4th, S. But we have R in 1st, which we could test, but we already have a candidate with R in 1st.

But ""RIPES"" has I and P, which are new.

But I think ""PORES"" is better because it moves R to a different position.

We could also consider ""STREP"" but that's 5 letters? S-T-R-E-P. But ""strep"" is a valid word? It might be informal for streptococcus, but sometimes accepted. To be safe, let's stick to common words.

""PROSE"": P, R in 2nd? But we must avoid R in 2nd. So no.

""PRONE"": P, R in 2nd? Avoid.

""ROGUE"": E in 5th? Avoid.

So back to ""PORES"" or ""ROBES"".

I think I'll go with ""PORES"" because it tests R in position 3, which is a new position, and we avoid repeating the same position for R.

So my second guess: PORES

<guess>pores</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: not in word, R: in word but wrong position, A: not in word, N: not in word, E: in word but wrong position), the following is known:
- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively (since they were misplaced in ""crane"").
- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word.
- The new guess must include R and E, avoid C, A, N, and place R in a position other than 2 and E in a position other than 5.
- To maximize information, the guess should use new letters and test R and E in new positions.

The word ""pores"" was chosen because:
- It includes R (in position 3, a new position to test) and E (in position 4, avoiding position 5).
- It introduces three new letters: P, O, S.
- It avoids excluded letters (C, A, N) and uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.
- Testing R in position 3 helps narrow down its correct placement, while E in position 4 provides new information.

<guess>pores</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: pores -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓) S(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- A: x (not in the word)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)

So, from guess 1:
- Excluded letters: C, A, N
- R and E are in the word, but R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.

Guess 2: ""pores""
- P: x (not in the word)
- O: x (not in the word)
- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)
- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)
- S: x (not in the word)

So, from guess 2:
- Excluded letters: P, O, S (added to C, A, N from before)
- E is in the word and in the correct position! Specifically, E is in position 4 (since in ""pores"", E is the 4th letter and got a check).

Also, R is in the word but not in position 3 (since it was misplaced in position 3 of ""pores"").

Now, we know:
- E is fixed in position 4 (because we have E(✓) in the 4th position).
- R is in the word, but not in position 2 (from guess 1) and not in position 3 (from guess 2). So R must be in position 1 or 5? But wait, positions are 1 to 5.

Positions: 1,2,3,4,5

For R:
- Not in 2 (from ""crane"" position 2)
- Not in 3 (from ""pores"" position 3)

So R must be in position 1, 4, or 5? But position 4 is taken by E (we know E is fixed at position 4). So R cannot be in position 4 because E is there. Therefore, R must be in position 1 or 5.

But in the word, R and E are distinct, so position 4 is E, so R can only be in 1 or 5.

Also, we have excluded letters: C, A, N, P, O, S.

So the secret word has:
- E in position 4.
- R in position 1 or 5.
- And one more letter that we know: from guess 1, we have R and E, but we don't know about other letters.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we need to find the other three letters.

Excluded letters: C, A, N, P, O, S. So available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know R and E are in, but R is already accounted for).

But R is in the word, so we don't need to include it again if we are using it, but in the guess we have to include it if we are testing positions.

Now, for the next guess, we need to:
- Have E in position 4 (since it's fixed).
- Include R, but place it in either position 1 or 5 to test which one it is.
- Use only letters that are not excluded, so avoid C, A, N, P, O, S.
- Also, we want to test other letters to find the remaining three.

The secret word has E in 4, R in 1 or 5, and three other letters from the available set.

We have two cases for R: either in 1 or in 5.

We can design a guess that tests one of these cases and also tests new letters.

For example, if we put R in position 1, then we can have a word like R _ _ E _, with the middle letters being new.

Similarly, if we put R in position 5, we have _ _ _ E R.

But we don't know which one, so we might choose one to test.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has R in position 1 and also tests other possibilities, or in position 5.

But we have to make a valid word.

Also, we have only 4 guesses left (since 2 used, total 6).

Let me list possible words that have E in position 4 and R in position 1 or 5.

First, with R in position 1 and E in 4: R ? ? E ?

Available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common words:
- ""RULER"": But L and E? R U L E R? That has two R's? And E in 4th. But we have excluded S, but L and U are available. However, ""RULER"" has R at the end too? Positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R. But we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we are testing R in position 1 and 5? But we only need one R, but if the word has two, it's possible. But let's see feedback: we know E is in 4, so that's fixed. But if we guess ""RULER"", and the secret has only one R, it might be confusing.

But we don't know the letter counts. So it's risky.

- ""RIVER"": R I V E R? Again, two R's and E in 4th. Same issue.

- ""RIDER"": R I D E R? Two R's.

- ""RARER"": Multiple R's.

It might be hard to avoid if we put R at start and end.

What about words with R at 1 and E at 4, but no R at 5? For example, ""RIPEN"" but N is excluded.

""RIPED"" not a word.

""RICES"" but C and S excluded.

""RIFLE"": R I F L E? But E is in 5th? In ""RIFLE"", positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:F, 4:L, 5:E. But we need E in 4th, not 5th. Here E is in 5th, which we cannot do because we know E is fixed at 4.

We need E in position 4.

So the word must have the form: ? ? ? E ? with E in the fourth position.

For R in position 1: R ? ? E ?

For R in position 5: ? ? ? E R

Now, let's find words without excluded letters.

First, with R in 1: R ? ? E ?

Possible words:
- ""RUBLE"": R U B L E? But E is in 5th? 1:R,2:U,3:B,4:L,5:E -> E is in 5th, not 4th. We need the fourth letter to be E, so ""RUBLE"" has L in 4th and E in 5th, not good.

- ""RUMBLE"" is 6 letters.

- ""RIPED"" not valid.

- ""RIDGE"": R I D G E -> 1:R,2:I,3:D,4:G,5:E -> E in 5th, not 4th.

- ""RIFLE"": same, E in 5th.

- ""RUBLE"": same.

It seems difficult to have E in 4th with R in 1st because many words end with E.

What about ""RAREE""? Not common.

""RAMEE""? Not common.

Perhaps ""REBEL"": R E B E L? But E in 2nd and 4th? 1:R,2:E,3:B,4:E,5:L. So E is in 4th? Position 4 is E, yes. And position 2 is also E. So it has two E's? But we don't know if the secret word has two E's. Also, we have E in 4th, which is fixed. But in this case, for ""REBEL"", we have E in 2nd and 4th.

But we know E is in the word, but we don't know if there are multiple.

But let's see: available letters, B and L are not excluded.

But we have E in 2nd, which we don't know about.

But we are trying to test R in 1st.

Similarly, ""ROWED"": but O excluded, and E in 4th? R O W E D -> 1:R,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:D. O is excluded, so not allowed.

""RACED"": C and A excluded.

So hard to find a word with R in 1 and E in 4.

Perhaps ""RIPEN"" but N excluded.

Another idea: ""RHEUM"" but E in 3rd? Not 4th.

Maybe we should consider R in position 5.

So form: ? ? ? E R

With E in 4 and R in 5.

Then the first three letters are from available set.

Common words:
- ""USHER"": U S H E R -> but S is excluded, and E in 4, R in 5. S excluded, so no.
- ""OTHER"": O T H E R -> O excluded.
- ""LATER"": L A T E R -> A excluded.
- ""METER"": M E T E R -> E in 2nd and 4th? 1:M,2:E,3:T,4:E,5:R. So E in 4th and R in 5th. But E is in 2nd as well. Available letters: M, T, E, R. E and R are known, M and T not excluded.
- ""METER"" is a valid word.

Similarly, ""PETER"": P excluded.

""REFER"": R E F E R -> 1:R,2:E,3:F,4:E,5:R. But R in 1st and 5th, E in 2nd and 4th. But we have E in 4th, which is good, but we are testing R in 5th, but also R in 1st? And we don't know counts.

But ""METER"" might be acceptable.

Another: ""TIGER"": T I G E R -> 1:T,2:I,3:G,4:E,5:R. E in 4th, R in 5th. T, I, G not excluded.

""TIGER"" is a good word.

Similarly, ""RIDER"" has two R's and E not in 4th.

""TIGER"" has T, I, G, E, R.

E in 4th, R in 5th.

We can also consider ""HYPER"": H Y P E R -> but P excluded.

""CYBER"": C excluded.

""BOXER"": O excluded.

So ""TIGER"" is a candidate.

Another: ""LIVER"": L I V E R -> E in 4th? 1:L,2:I,3:V,4:E,5:R. Yes, and L, I, V not excluded.

""RIVER"" has R in 1st, which we might not want to test yet.

But in ""LIVER"", R is in 5th, which is one of the possibilities.

Similarly, ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> O excluded.

""HAZER"": H A Z E R -> A excluded.

""FEWER"": F E W E R -> E in 2nd and 4th, R in 5th. 1:F,2:E,3:W,4:E,5:R. E in 4th, so good. F, W not excluded.

But two E's.

We can choose ""TIGER"" or ""LIVER"".

Now, back to the case with R in 1st: we had trouble finding a word, but let's try ""REEDY"": R E E D Y -> 1:R,2:E,3:E,4:D,5:Y. But E is in 2nd and 3rd, and position 4 is D, not E. We need position 4 to be E.

""REBUS"": S excluded.

""RELIC"": R E L I C -> C excluded.

""REMIT"": R E M I T -> E in 2nd, not 4th.

It seems that having R in 1st and E in 4th is rare because the word would have to have a vowel or something in between.

""RABBI"": A and B? But A excluded, and E not present.

Perhaps ""ROUGE"": O and E in 5th? Not.

I think it's easier to go with R in 5th for now.

So let's choose a word with E in 4th and R in 5th, and three new letters.

For example, ""TIGER"": T in 1st, I in 2nd, G in 3rd, E in 4th, R in 5th.

This tests T, I, G in positions 1,2,3, and confirms if R is in 5th.

If R is in 5th, then we get R(✓) in 5th, and we know E is already ✓ in 4th.

If not, then R must be in 1st, and we'll know from the feedback.

In this guess, if R is not in 5th, then we will get R(-) or R(x)? But we know R is in the word, so if not in 5th, it must be misplaced, but since position 1,2,3 are occupied by T,I,G, if R is not in 5th, it might show as - in one of the first three? But we have only three positions.

The word has positions 1:T, 2:I, 3:G, 4:E, 5:R.

We know E is fixed at 4, so E will be ✓.

R is in 5th, so if the secret has R in 5th, we get ✓ for R.

If the secret has R in 1st, then in this guess, R is in 5th, which is wrong position, so we would get R(-) for position 5, and also, since R is in the word but not here, it might be in position 1, but position 1 has T, which might be x or something.

Let's simulate:

Case 1: secret has R in 5th.
Then feedback: T (x or -), I (x or -), G (x or -), E(✓), R(✓)

Case 2: secret has R in 1st (and not in 5th).
Then feedback: T (x or -), but R is in 1st, so for position 1, T is not R, so if T is not in word, x, or if T is in word but wrong position, -.
Similarly for I and G.
E(✓)
R is in 5th, but secret has R in 1st, so R is in the word but not in position 5, so we get R(-) for position 5.

Also, since R is in 1st, and we have T in 1st, if T is not R, which it isn't, so position 1: if T is not in word, x; if T is in word but not position 1, -.

But we don't know about T.

Similarly, if R is in 1st, then in the secret word, position 1 is R, so our guess has T in 1st, which is wrong, so we get x or - for T.

But we will get the feedback.

Moreover, by testing R in 5th, we can confirm or rule out that position.

We also test three new letters: T, I, G.

Another candidate: ""LIVER"": L in 1st, I in 2nd, V in 3rd, E in 4th, R in 5th.

Similarly, ""FIGHT"" no E.

""WIDEN"" but N excluded.

""QUEUE"" not.

I think ""TIGER"" is fine.

But we have to make sure it's valid.

Another word: ""DINER"": D I N E R -> but N excluded.

""FILER"": F I L E R -> E in 4th, R in 5th. F, I, L not excluded.

""FILER"" is a word, meaning one that files.

Similarly, ""TIMER"": T I M E R -> M not excluded.

""TIMER"" is good.

But ""TIGER"" is more common.

We can choose ""TIMER"" to test M instead of G.

But G and M are both plausible.

Since we have E fixed at 4, and we need to find R's position, let's go with ""TIGER"".

So guess: TIGER

But in ""TIGER"", we have E in 4th and R in 5th.

We know E is fixed at 4, so that will be ✓.

R in 5th: if it's correct, ✓; if not, -.

Also, we test T, I, G.

If R is not in 5th, then it must be in 1st, and we'll know for the next guess.

Moreover, if we get T, I, or G as present, we get more information.

So I think it's a good guess.

Therefore, third guess: TIGER

<guess>tiger</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

From the feedback:
- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  
  Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C, A, N are not in the word.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: ""pores""**  
  Feedback: P(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓) S(x)  
  Interpretation:  
  - P, O, S are not in the word.  
  - R is in the word but not in position 3.  
  - E is in the word and correctly placed in position 4.  

### Current Knowledge
- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  
  - E is fixed in position 4 (from ""pores"" feedback).  
- **Confirmed present but misplaced**:  
  - R is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""crane"" and ""pores""). Since E occupies position 4, R must be in position 1 or 5.  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, P, O, S (not in the word).  
- **Available letters**: All letters except excluded ones (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
- **Word structure**: The secret word has the form `[letter1][letter2][letter3]E[letter5]`, with R in position 1 or 5.  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- **Goal**: Resolve R's position (1 or 5) while testing new letters for the remaining positions.  
- **Approach**:  
  - Place E in position 4 (fixed).  
  - Test R in position 5 to check if it is correct (if not, R must be in position 1).  
  - Use new, common letters for positions 1, 2, and 3 to maximize information.  
  - Avoid excluded letters.  
- **Chosen word: ""tiger""**  
  - Structure: T (position 1), I (position 2), G (position 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  
  - Why ""tiger""?  
    - Tests R in position 5: If R is correct here, we confirm position 5. If not, R must be in position 1 (and we get a misplaced indicator).  
    - Tests three new letters (T, I, G) in positions 1–3.  
    - Uses common letters to cover frequent possibilities.  
    - Avoids excluded letters and repeats.  
  - Expected outcomes:  
    - If R is in position 5, feedback will show R(✓).  
    - If R is not in position 5, feedback will show R(-), confirming R is in position 1.  
    - Feedback for T, I, G will reveal if any are in the word and their positions.

So if we put R in 2nd again, it would be the same position and we know it\'s wrong. We should avoid putting R in 2nd.

But note: we have only 5 letters and we need to use R and E. Also, we don\'t want to repeat letters unnecessarily because we want to test more letters.\n\nBut ""RIPER"" has two R\'s and the secret word might not have two R\'s. We don\'t know.

But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. Also, S and T. But R is in 2nd? Avoid R in 2nd.\n\n- ""REVEL"": R in 1st? Then E in 2nd and 4th? But again, two E\'s and R in 1st is okay.

Avoid.\n\n""RIFLE"": R in 1st, I, F, L, E in 5th? Avoid.\n\n""RUMOR"": No E.\n\nWe need a word that has E in a position other than 5th.\n\nHow about ""ROUTE"": R in 1st, O, U, T, E in 5th? Avoid.\n\n""RIPEN"": But N is excluded.\n\n""RIPED"": Not a word? ""RIPED"" is not valid. The past tense is ""riped"" is not common, usually ""ripened"" but that\'s 7 letters.\n\nLet\'s think of common words.\n\n""ROBED"": R in 1st, O, B, E in 4th, D. This seems good: E is in 4th (allowed), R in 1st (allowed). Letters: R, O, B, E, D. All new except R and E, and no excluded letters.\n\nBut is ""ROBED"" a valid word? Yes, meaning to have put on robes.\n\nAnother option: ""ROLES"": R in 1st, O, L, E in 4th, S. E in 4th is allowed.\n\nBut we have two options: ""ROBED"" and ""ROLES"". Both are valid.\n\nWe could also consider ""RULES"": R in 1st, U, L, E in 4th, S.\n\nBut let\'s choose one that has common letters to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put R in a different position, not 1st, to get more information about R\'s position.\n\nFor example, put R in 3rd or 4th.\n\nSimilarly for E, put in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.\n\nLet me try to find a word with R in 3rd and E in 1st, for example.\n\n""PERKY"": P, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, K, Y. But E in 1st is allowed. And R in 3rd is allowed. Letters: P, E, R, K, Y. All new and not excluded.\n\nBut we know E is in the word, so having E in 1st is okay.\n\nAnother: ""BERYL"": B, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, Y, L. But E in 1st? Actually, ""BERYL"" has E in 2nd? Let me spell: B-E-R-Y-L. So E in 2nd, R in 3rd. That\'s okay.\n\nBut we don\'t know about B, Y, L.\n\nWe can also consider ""TERSE"": T, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, S, E. But two E\'s? And E in 5th? The last E is in 5th, which we must avoid. So no.\n\n""VERGE"": V, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, G, E in 5th? Avoid E in 5th.\n\n""MERGE"": M, E in 1st? Then R in 3rd, G, E in 5th? Avoid.\n\n""JERKY"": J, E in 1st, R in 3rd, K, Y. This might be a good one: tests J, E, R, K, Y. But J is less common.\n\n""FERAL"": F, E in 1st, R in 3rd, A? But A is excluded. So no.\n\n""HERON"": H, E in 1st, R in 3rd, O, N? But N is excluded.\n\nSo it\'s tricky.\n\nAnother idea: ""ROBES"" as I thought earlier: R in 1st, O, B, E in 4th, S. This seems solid.\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a word with R in 4th and E in 2nd, for example.\n\n""TORES"": T, O, R in 3rd? Then E in 4th? Wait, T-O-R-E-S. So R in 3rd, E in 4th. But E is in 4th, which is allowed. And R in 3rd is allowed. But we have S at the end. And we avoid E in 5th? Here E is in 4th, so okay.\n\nBut ""TORES"" has O, R, E, S, T. All new and not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""CORES"" has C? Excluded.\n\n""PORES"": P, O, R in 3rd, E in 4th, S. This is good.\n\nBut we have two good candidates: ""ROBES"" and ""PORES"".\n\nIn ""ROBES"": R in 1st, O in 2nd, B in 3rd, E in 4th, S in 5th.\nIn ""PORES"": P in 1st, O in 2nd, R in 3rd, E in 4th, S in 5th.\n\nWe know that R is in the word but not in position 2, so in ""PORES"", R is in 3rd, which is a new position, so that might be better to test if R is in 3rd.\n\nSimilarly, E is in 4th in both, which is a new position (previously we had E in 5th, which was wrong).\n\nIn the first guess, E was in 5th and it was wrong, so E in 4th is a new position.\n\nBut we don\'t know if E can be in 4th or not.\n\nI think ""PORES"" is a good choice because it tests R in a new position (3rd) and E in 4th, and we get to test P, O, S as well.\n\nAnother candidate: ""RIPES"" but R in 1st, I, P, E in 4th, S. But we have R in 1st, which we could test, but we already have a candidate with R in 1st.\n\nBut ""RIPES"" has I and P, which are new.\n\nBut I think ""PORES"" is better because it moves R to a different position.\n\nWe could also consider ""STREP"" but that\'s 5 letters? S-T-R-E-P. But ""strep"" is a valid word? It might be informal for streptococcus, but sometimes accepted. To be safe, let\'s stick to common words.\n\n""PROSE"": P, R in 2nd? But we must avoid R in 2nd. So no.\n\n""PRONE"": P, R in 2nd? Avoid.\n\n""ROGUE"": E in 5th? Avoid.\n\nSo back to ""PORES"" or ""ROBES"".\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""PORES"" because it tests R in position 3, which is a new position, and we avoid repeating the same position for R.\n\nSo my second guess: PORES\n\n<guess>pores</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"" (C: not in word, R: in word but wrong position, A: not in word, N: not in word, E: in word but wrong position), the following is known:\n- The secret word contains the letters R and E, but not in positions 2 or 5 respectively (since they were misplaced in ""crane"").\n- The letters C, A, and N are not in the secret word.\n- The new guess must include R and E, avoid C, A, N, and place R in a position other than 2 and E in a position other than 5.\n- To maximize information, the guess should use new letters and test R and E in new positions.\n\nThe word ""pores"" was chosen because:\n- It includes R (in position 3, a new position to test) and E (in position 4, avoiding position 5).\n- It introduces three new letters: P, O, S.\n- It avoids excluded letters (C, A, N) and uses distinct letters to cover more possibilities.\n- Testing R in position 3 helps narrow down its correct placement, while E in position 4 provides new information.\n\n<guess>pores</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: pores -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓) S(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane""\n- C: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)\n- A: x (not in the word)\n- N: x (not in the word)\n- E: - (in the word, but wrong position)\n\nSo, from guess 1:\n- Excluded letters: C, A, N\n- R and E are in the word, but R is not in position 2, and E is not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: ""pores""\n- P: x (not in the word)\n- O: x (not in the word)\n- R: - (in the word, but wrong position)\n- E: ✓ (in the word and in the correct position)\n- S: x (not in the word)\n\nSo, from guess 2:\n- Excluded letters: P, O, S (added to C, A, N from before)\n- E is in the word and in the correct position!

But position 4 is taken by E (we know E is fixed at position 4). So R cannot be in position 4 because E is there. Therefore, R must be in position 1 or 5.\n\nBut in the word, R and E are distinct, so position 4 is E, so R can only be in 1 or 5.\n\nAlso, we have excluded letters: C, A, N, P, O, S.\n\nSo the secret word has:\n- E in position 4.\n- R in position 1 or 5.\n- And one more letter that we know: from guess 1, we have R and E, but we don\'t know about other letters.\n\nWe also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we need to find the other three letters.\n\nExcluded letters: C, A, N, P, O, S. So available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and we know R and E are in, but R is already accounted for).\n\nBut R is in the word, so we don\'t need to include it again if we are using it, but in the guess we have to include it if we are testing positions.\n\nNow, for the next guess, we need to:\n- Have E in position 4 (since it\'s fixed).\n- Include R, but place it in either position 1 or 5 to test which one it is.\n- Use only letters that are not excluded, so avoid C, A, N, P, O, S.\n- Also, we want to test other letters to find the remaining three.\n\nThe secret word has E in 4, R in 1 or 5, and three other letters from the available set.\n\nWe have two cases for R: either in 1 or in 5.\n\nWe can design a guess that tests one of these cases and also tests new letters.\n\nFor example, if we put R in position 1, then we can have a word like R _ _ E _, with the middle letters being new.\n\nSimilarly, if we put R in position 5, we have _ _ _ E R.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one, so we might choose one to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has R in position 1 and also tests other possibilities, or in position 5.\n\nBut we have to make a valid word.\n\nAlso, we have only 4 guesses left (since 2 used, total 6).\n\nLet me list possible words that have E in position 4 and R in position 1 or 5.\n\nFirst, with R in position 1 and E in 4: R ? ? E ?\n\nAvailable letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,K,L,M,Q,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nCommon words:\n- ""RULER"": But L and E? R U L E R? That has two R\'s? And E in 4th. But we have excluded S, but L and U are available. However, ""RULER"" has R at the end too? Positions: 1:R, 2:U, 3:L, 4:E, 5:R. But we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. Also, we are testing R in position 1 and 5? But we only need one R, but if the word has two, it\'s possible. But let\'s see feedback: we know E is in 4, so that\'s fixed. But if we guess ""RULER"", and the secret has only one R, it might be confusing.\n\nBut we don\'t know the letter counts. So it\'s risky.\n\n- ""RIVER"": R I V E R? Again, two R\'s and E in 4th. Same issue.\n\n- ""RIDER"": R I D E R? Two R\'s.\n\n- ""RARER"": Multiple R\'s.\n\nIt might be hard to avoid if we put R at start and end.\n\nWhat about words with R at 1 and E at 4, but no R at 5? For example, ""RIPEN"" but N is excluded.\n\n""RIPED"" not a word.\n\n""RICES"" but C and S excluded.\n\n""RIFLE"": R I F L E? But E is in 5th? In ""RIFLE"", positions: 1:R, 2:I, 3:F, 4:L, 5:E. But we need E in 4th, not 5th. Here E is in 5th, which we cannot do because we know E is fixed at 4.\n\nWe need E in position 4.\n\nSo the word must have the form: ? ? ? E ? with E in the fourth position.\n\nFor R in position 1: R ? ? E ?\n\nFor R in position 5: ? ? ? E R\n\nNow, let\'s find words without excluded letters.\n\nFirst, with R in 1: R ? ? E ?\n\nPossible words:\n- ""RUBLE"": R U B L E? But E is in 5th? 1:R,2:U,3:B,4:L,5:E -> E is in 5th, not 4th. We need the fourth letter to be E, so ""RUBLE"" has L in 4th and E in 5th, not good.\n\n- ""RUMBLE"" is 6 letters.\n\n- ""RIPED"" not valid.\n\n- ""RIDGE"": R I D G E -> 1:R,2:I,3:D,4:G,5:E -> E in 5th, not 4th.\n\n- ""RIFLE"": same, E in 5th.\n\n- ""RUBLE"": same.\n\nIt seems difficult to have E in 4th with R in 1st because many words end with E.\n\nWhat about ""RAREE""? Not common.\n\n""RAMEE""? Not common.\n\nPerhaps ""REBEL"": R E B E L? But E in 2nd and 4th? 1:R,2:E,3:B,4:E,5:L. So E is in 4th? Position 4 is E, yes. And position 2 is also E. So it has two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. Also, we have E in 4th, which is fixed. But in this case, for ""REBEL"", we have E in 2nd and 4th.\n\nBut we know E is in the word, but we don\'t know if there are multiple.\n\nBut let\'s see: available letters, B and L are not excluded.\n\nBut we have E in 2nd, which we don\'t know about.\n\nBut we are trying to test R in 1st.\n\nSimilarly, ""ROWED"": but O excluded, and E in 4th? R O W E D -> 1:R,2:O,3:W,4:E,5:D. O is excluded, so not allowed.\n\n""RACED"": C and A excluded.\n\nSo hard to find a word with R in 1 and E in 4.\n\nPerhaps ""RIPEN"" but N excluded.\n\nAnother idea: ""RHEUM"" but E in 3rd? Not 4th.\n\nMaybe we should consider R in position 5.\n\nSo form: ? ? ? E R\n\nWith E in 4 and R in 5.\n\nThen the first three letters are from available set.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""USHER"": U S H E R -> but S is excluded, and E in 4, R in 5. S excluded, so no.\n- ""OTHER"": O T H E R -> O excluded.\n- ""LATER"": L A T E R -> A excluded.\n- ""METER"": M E T E R -> E in 2nd and 4th? 1:M,2:E,3:T,4:E,5:R. So E in 4th and R in 5th. But E is in 2nd as well. Available letters: M, T, E, R. E and R are known, M and T not excluded.\n- ""METER"" is a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""PETER"": P excluded.\n\n""REFER"": R E F E R -> 1:R,2:E,3:F,4:E,5:R. But R in 1st and 5th, E in 2nd and 4th. But we have E in 4th, which is good, but we are testing R in 5th, but also R in 1st? And we don\'t know counts.\n\nBut ""METER"" might be acceptable.\n\nAnother: ""TIGER"": T I G E R -> 1:T,2:I,3:G,4:E,5:R. E in 4th, R in 5th. T, I, G not excluded.\n\n""TIGER"" is a good word.\n\nSimilarly, ""RIDER"" has two R\'s and E not in 4th.\n\n""TIGER"" has T, I, G, E, R.\n\nE in 4th, R in 5th.\n\nWe can also consider ""HYPER"": H Y P E R -> but P excluded.\n\n""CYBER"": C excluded.\n\n""BOXER"": O excluded.\n\nSo ""TIGER"" is a candidate.\n\nAnother: ""LIVER"": L I V E R -> E in 4th? 1:L,2:I,3:V,4:E,5:R. Yes, and L, I, V not excluded.\n\n""RIVER"" has R in 1st, which we might not want to test yet.\n\nBut in ""LIVER"", R is in 5th, which is one of the possibilities.\n\nSimilarly, ""MOVER"": M O V E R -> O excluded.\n\n""HAZER"": H A Z E R -> A excluded.\n\n""FEWER"": F E W E R -> E in 2nd and 4th, R in 5th. 1:F,2:E,3:W,4:E,5:R. E in 4th, so good. F, W not excluded.\n\nBut two E\'s.\n\nWe can choose ""TIGER"" or ""LIVER"".\n\nNow, back to the case with R in 1st: we had trouble finding a word, but let\'s try ""REEDY"": R E E D Y -> 1:R,2:E,3:E,4:D,5:Y. But E is in 2nd and 3rd, and position 4 is D, not E. We need position 4 to be E.\n\n""REBUS"": S excluded.\n\n""RELIC"": R E L I C -> C excluded.\n\n""REMIT"": R E M I T -> E in 2nd, not 4th.\n\nIt seems that having R in 1st and E in 4th is rare because the word would have to have a vowel or something in between.\n\n""RABBI"": A and B? But A excluded, and E not present.\n\nPerhaps ""ROUGE"": O and E in 5th? Not.\n\nI think it\'s easier to go with R in 5th for now.\n\nSo let\'s choose a word with E in 4th and R in 5th, and three new letters.\n\nFor example, ""TIGER"": T in 1st, I in 2nd, G in 3rd, E in 4th, R in 5th.\n\nThis tests T, I, G in positions 1,2,3, and confirms if R is in 5th.\n\nIf R is in 5th, then we get R(✓) in 5th, and we know E is already ✓ in 4th.\n\nIf not, then R must be in 1st, and we\'ll know from the feedback.\n\nIn this guess, if R is not in 5th, then we will get R(-) or R(x)? But we know R is in the word, so if not in 5th, it must be misplaced, but since position 1,2,3 are occupied by T,I,G, if R is not in 5th, it might show as - in one of the first three? But we have only three positions.\n\nThe word has positions 1:T, 2:I, 3:G, 4:E, 5:R.\n\nWe know E is fixed at 4, so E will be ✓.\n\nR is in 5th, so if the secret has R in 5th, we get ✓ for R.\n\nIf the secret has R in 1st, then in this guess, R is in 5th, which is wrong position, so we would get R(-) for position 5, and also, since R is in the word but not here, it might be in position 1, but position 1 has T, which might be x or something.\n\nLet\'s simulate:\n\nCase 1: secret has R in 5th.\nThen feedback: T (x or -), I (x or -), G (x or -), E(✓), R(✓)\n\nCase 2: secret has R in 1st (and not in 5th).\nThen feedback: T (x or -), but R is in 1st, so for position 1, T is not R, so if T is not in word, x, or if T is in word but wrong position, -.\nSimilarly for I and G.\nE(✓)\nR is in 5th, but secret has R in 1st, so R is in the word but not in position 5, so we get R(-) for position 5.\n\nAlso, since R is in 1st, and we have T in 1st, if T is not R, which it isn\'t, so position 1: if T is not in word, x; if T is in word but not position 1, -.\n\nBut we don\'t know about T.\n\nSimilarly, if R is in 1st, then in the secret word, position 1 is R, so our guess has T in 1st, which is wrong, so we get x or - for T.\n\nBut we will get the feedback.\n\nMoreover, by testing R in 5th, we can confirm or rule out that position.\n\nWe also test three new letters: T, I, G.\n\nAnother candidate: ""LIVER"": L in 1st, I in 2nd, V in 3rd, E in 4th, R in 5th.\n\nSimilarly, ""FIGHT"" no E.\n\n""WIDEN"" but N excluded.\n\n""QUEUE"" not.\n\nI think ""TIGER"" is fine.\n\nBut we have to make sure it\'s valid.\n\nAnother word: ""DINER"": D I N E R -> but N excluded.\n\n""FILER"": F I L E R -> E in 4th, R in 5th. F, I, L not excluded.\n\n""FILER"" is a word, meaning one that files.\n\nSimilarly, ""TIMER"": T I M E R -> M not excluded.\n\n""TIMER"" is good.\n\nBut ""TIGER"" is more common.\n\nWe can choose ""TIMER"" to test M instead of G.\n\nBut G and M are both plausible.\n\nSince we have E fixed at 4, and we need to find R\'s position, let\'s go with ""TIGER"".\n\nSo guess: TIGER\n\nBut in ""TIGER"", we have E in 4th and R in 5th.\n\nWe know E is fixed at 4, so that will be ✓.\n\nR in 5th: if it\'s correct, ✓; if not, -.\n\nAlso, we test T, I, G.\n\nIf R is not in 5th, then it must be in 1st, and we\'ll know for the next guess.\n\nMoreover, if we get T, I, or G as present, we get more information.\n\nSo I think it\'s a good guess.\n\nTherefore, third guess: TIGER\n\n<guess>tiger</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\nFrom the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: ""crane""**  \n  Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C, A, N are not in the word.  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 2.  \n  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  \n\n- **Guess 2: ""pores""**  \n  Feedback: P(x) O(x) R(-) E(✓) S(x)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - P, O, S are not in the word.  \n  - R is in the word but not in position 3.  \n  - E is in the word and correctly placed in position 4.  \n\n### Current Knowledge\n- **Confirmed letters and positions**:  \n  - E is fixed in position 4 (from ""pores"" feedback).  \n- **Confirmed present but misplaced**:  \n  - R is in the word but cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from ""crane"" and ""pores""). Since E occupies position 4, R must be in position 1 or 5.  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, P, O, S (not in the word).  \n- **Available letters**: All letters except excluded ones (B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).  \n- **Word structure**: The secret word has the form `[letter1][letter2][letter3]E[letter5]`, with R in position 1 or 5.  \n\n### Strategy for Next Guess\n- **Goal**: Resolve R\'s position (1 or 5) while testing new letters for the remaining positions.  \n- **Approach**:  \n  - Place E in position 4 (fixed).  \n  - Test R in position 5 to check if it is correct (if not, R must be in position 1).  \n  - Use new, common letters for positions 1, 2, and 3 to maximize information.  \n  - Avoid excluded letters.  \n- **Chosen word: ""tiger""**  \n  - Structure: T (position 1), I (position 2), G (position 3), E (position 4), R (position 5).  \n  - Why ""tiger""?  \n    - Tests R in position 5: If R is correct here, we confirm position 5.

We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: ""pores""
- P: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)
- S: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""tiger""
- T: - (in word, wrong position)
- I: x (not in word)
- G: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position) [this is position 4]
- R: ✓ (correct position) [this is position 5]

Now, from the feedback:

1. E is confirmed in position 4 (from guess 2 and 3).
2. R is now confirmed in position 5 (from guess 3, since we got ✓ for R in position 5).
   - Previously, R was misplaced in position 2 (guess 1) and position 3 (guess 2), so now we know R is fixed at position 5.

Additionally, from guess 3:
- T is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got T(-) for position 1).
- I is not in the word (x).
- G is not in the word (x).

Also, from previous guesses, we have excluded letters: C, A, N, P, O, S, I, G.

So excluded letters: C, A, N, P, O, S, I, G.

We also know that the secret word has:
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
- And T is in the word, but not in position 1.

The word structure: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E R

We need to find the first three letters, with T being one of them (but not in position 1), and the other two from the remaining available letters.

Available letters (not excluded and not already placed): 
Excluded: C, A, N, P, O, S, I, G.
We also have E and R placed, so we don't need to consider them for the missing positions.

Available: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But T is in the word, so T must be in one of positions 2 or 3 (since not in 1).

So the word has T in position 2 or 3, and two other letters from the available set in the remaining positions.

We have two positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, but T is in 2 or 3, so:
- If T is in position 2, then positions 1 and 3 are two other letters.
- If T is in position 3, then positions 1 and 2 are two other letters.

We need to make a guess that helps us find the missing letters and the position of T.

We have 3 guesses left (since 3 used, total 6).

For the next guess, we should try to cover common letters and positions.

We know the word ends with ""ER"".

Common words ending with ""ER"": like water, later, but A is excluded; other: maker, but A excluded; user, but S excluded; under, etc.

But we have constraints.

We can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 or 3, and uses common letters for the other positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we might want to test multiple possibilities.

But we can also try to confirm the position of T.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and constraints.

The word: [1] [2] [3] E R

Constraints:
- T is in the word, but not in position 1, so in 2 or 3.
- The letters in positions 1,2,3 must be from available: B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and T (but T only in 2 or 3).

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words:

First, if T is in position 2: [1] T [3] E R

Then [1] and [3] from available: B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Examples:
- ""UTTER"": U T T E R -> but has two T's? And U is available. But we don't know if T appears twice. Also, position 3 is T, which is the same as position 2? But in the secret, T might be only once? We don't know. But ""UTTER"" has T in 2 and 3, so if the secret has only one T, it might not be good. But we know T is in the word, but we don't know the count.

- ""UTTER"" might be possible, but let's see other options.

- ""ALTER"": but A excluded.

- ""ENTER"": E in position 1? But we have E in position 4, and ""ENTER"" has E in 1 and 4? 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but N excluded, and E in 1st? But we have E in 4th, but if E is also in 1st, it might be possible, but N is excluded.

- ""OTHER"": O excluded.

- ""UNDER"": U N D E R -> N excluded.

- ""UPPER"": P excluded.

- ""OFFER"": O and F? O excluded.

- ""EATER"": A excluded.

- ""METER"": M E T E R -> but E in 1st? 1:M,2:E,3:T,4:E,5:R. But E is in 2nd and 4th? We know E is in 4th, but if E is also in 2nd, it might be possible. But in this case, position 2 is E, which we don't know about. Also, M is available. But ""METER"" has E in 2nd, which is a new position. However, we are not sure if E is duplicated.

But we have to consider that E might be duplicated? But in the feedback so far, we only know one E is in position 4. There could be more.

Similarly, for T, we know it's present, but not how many.

But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates for now.

Another word: ""HUTER"" not a word.

""BUTER"" not a word.

""LATER"" A excluded.

""MATER"" A excluded.

""VOTER"" O excluded.

""FUTER"" not a word.

""KITER"" K I T E R -> I excluded? I is excluded from guess 3 (I:x). So I cannot be used.

Available letters: B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

So for [1] T [3] E R:

- ""HATER"" A excluded.

""BITER"" B I T E R -> I excluded.

""LITER"" L I T E R -> I excluded.

""MITER"" M I T E R -> I excluded.

""RUTER"" not common.

""TUTOR"" O excluded and T in 1st? Not, we are assuming T in 2nd.

Perhaps ""DUTER"" not a word.

""FUTER"" not.

Maybe ""MUTER"" not common.

""OUTER"" O excluded.

It's hard to find with T in 2nd.

Now, try T in position 3: [1] [2] T E R

Then [1] and [2] from available: B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Examples:
- ""BATTER"" but A excluded and two T's? 6 letters? ""BATTER"" is 6? B-A-T-T-E-R, 6 letters. No, 5: B1, A2, T3, T4, E5? No, positions: 1:B,2:A,3:T,4:E,5:R? But A excluded, and E should be in 4th? In ""BATER"" not a word.

- ""DATER"" A excluded.

- ""HATER"" A excluded.

- ""LATER"" A excluded.

- ""MATER"" A excluded.

- ""WATER"" A excluded.

- ""MITER"" but I excluded.

- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but I excluded, and positions: 1:L,2:I,3:T,4:R,5:E -> but we need E in 4th and R in 5th, here R is in 4th and E in 5th, not matching.

We need the pattern: [1][2]T E R, so position 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.

So words like:
- ""AFTER"" A excluded.
- ""ENTER"" E in 1st and N excluded.
- ""UNTER"" not common.
- ""INTER"" I excluded.
- ""OUTER"" O excluded.
- ""UPTER"" not a word.

""ALTER"" A excluded.

Perhaps ""DETER"": D E T E R -> 1:D,2:E,3:T,4:E,5:R. But E in 2nd and 4th? And D available. But we have E in 2nd, which might be possible.

Similarly, ""METER"": M E T E R, same as above.

""FETER"" not common.

""HEXER"": H E X E R -> E in 2nd and 4th.

But we don't know if E is duplicated.

Another possibility: ""DIVER"": D I V E R -> but I excluded.

""LIVER"" I excluded.

""COVER"" C and O excluded.

""MAKER"" A excluded.

""BAKER"" A excluded.

""JOKER"" O excluded.

""TOWER"" O excluded.

""SUPER"" S excluded.

""DUVET"" not ending with ER.

Perhaps we need to consider that T might not be the only letter, and we have to use the available letters.

List of possible words ending with ""TER"" (since position 3 is T, then E R, so the last three are T E R, so the word ends with ""TER"", but not necessarily, because position 3 is T, 4 is E, 5 is R, so the suffix is ""TER"", but ""TER"" as in T-E-R.

Common words ending with ""TER"": like after, alter, but A issues; enter, but E in 1st;  etc.

But with available letters, what about ""HUTER"" not word.

""LUTER"" not.

""KITTER"" has two T's and 6 letters.

Perhaps ""BUTLER"" is 6.

Maybe we missed some words.

Another idea: ""DEUCE"" not ending with ER.

Perhaps ""QUEER"" but Q and two E's: Q U E E R -> 1:Q,2:U,3:E,4:E,5:R. But position 4 is E, which is good, but position 3 is E? But we need position 3 to be T? No, in this case for T in position 3, we need [1][2]T E R, so position 3 is T.

In ""QUEER"", position 3 is E, not T.

Not matching.

Perhaps ""T is in position 2"" is more likely, but we had trouble finding words.

From guess 3, we have T in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2 or 3.

But in the secret word, position 4 is E, position 5 is R, so the first three letters are to be found.

We know T is one of them, in position 2 or 3.

Also, from available letters.

Perhaps we can guess a word that has T in position 2 or 3, and uses common letters for the other positions.

For example, let's put T in position 2 for the guess.

So guess: [1] T [3] E R

But E and R are fixed, so we need to choose [1] and [3] from available letters.

Available: B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common choices: U, D, L, M, etc.

Word: ""UTTER"" - but has two T's. If we guess ""UTTER"", it has U in 1, T in 2, T in 3, E in 4, R in 5.

But we know E and R are fixed, so feedback will tell us about U and the T's.

If the secret has only one T, then position 2 or 3 might be wrong.

But it's a valid guess to test.

Another word: ""METER"" but E in 2nd, which is not T.

"" DETER"": D E T E R -> E in 2nd, not T.

For position 2 to be T, we need a letter where the second letter is T.

Like ""UTERI"" not 5 letters.

""UTERUS"" too long.

Perhaps ""T is in position 3"" and we use ""DATER"" but A excluded.

I think we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters, or we might need to use a word that tests multiple things.

Another idea: since T is in the word and not in 1, we can guess a word with T in position 3 and two new letters in 1 and 2.

For example, ""HA TER"" not, ""HATER"" A excluded.

""LATER"" A excluded.

""MATER"" A excluded.

""WATER"" A excluded.

""BAKER"" A excluded.

All have A, which is excluded.

""F number"" not.

Perhaps ""DIVER"" but I excluded.

""LIKER"" I excluded.

""MAKER"" A excluded.

It's difficult.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words ending with ""ER"" that have E in 4th and R in 5th, and no excluded letters, and T in the word.

Excluded letters: C,A,N,P,O,S,I,G

So the word must contain T, and T in position 2 or 3.

Position 4 and 5 are E and R fixed.

So the word is: [1][2][3] E R

With [1], [2], [3] from B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and T in [2] or [3].

Possible combinations:

For T in [2]: [1] T [3] E R

[1] and [3] from B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Possible words:
- ""UTTER"" - U T T E R
- ""BUTLER"" too long.
- ""MUTER"" not common, but ""MUTER"" is not a standard word; ""muter"" is not common, usually ""mutter"" which is 6 letters.
- ""HUTED"" not.
- ""CITER"" C excluded.
- ""DIT R"" not.

Only ""UTTER"" seems common.

For T in [3]: [1][2] T E R

[1] and [2] from B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Possible words:
- ""DATER"" A excluded.
- ""HATER"" A excluded.
- ""LATER"" A excluded.
- ""MATER"" A excluded.
- ""WATER"" A excluded.
- ""BITER"" I excluded.
- ""LITER"" I excluded.
- ""MITER"" I excluded.
- ""TITER"" I excluded and T in 1st? T I T E R -> T in 1 and 3, I excluded.
- ""DETER"" D E T E R -> E in 2nd, which is not from available for [2], but E is already in the word, so it could be, but position 2 is E, which is a letter, but we are to use available letters, and E is not in the available list for new letters, but E is already known, so it could be duplicated.

In ""DETER"", we have D in 1, E in 2, T in 3, E in 4, R in 5.

So position 2 is E, which is the same as position 4.

But we know E is in position 4, but it might be in position 2 as well.

Similarly, ""METER"" M E T E R.

""FETER"" F E T E R.

""HEXER"" H E X E R.

""JEWER"" not.

""KEXES"" not.

""VET ER"" not.

So possible words: ""DETER"", ""METER"", ""FETER"" (less common), ""HEXER"" (less common).

Also, ""BEWER"" not.

""LEVER"" but E in 2nd and position, but L E V E R, V available, but E in 2nd.

But ""LEVER"" has V.

Similarly, ""FEVER"" F E V E R.

But in ""FEVER"", position 3 is V, not T.

We need position 3 to be T for this case.

For T in position 3, we need [1][2] T E R, so position 3 is T.

In ""DETER"", position 3 is T, position 2 is E.

Similarly for ""METER"".

So ""DETER"" and ""METER"" are valid.

Also, ""RETER"" not common.

""SETER"" S excluded.

So the possible secret words could be:
- ""UTTER"" (T in position 2 and 3)
- ""DETER"" (T in position 3, E in position 2)
- ""METER"" (T in position 3, E in position 2)
- ""FETER"" (less common)
- ""HEXER"" (less common)

But we have to guess one.

Since we have to make a guess, we can choose one that distinguishes.

For example, if we guess ""DETER"", it will tell us if it's correct or not.

But we can also guess a word that tests the position of T and other letters.

Another idea: guess a word that has T in position 3 and uses new letters for 1 and 2.

For example, ""HATER"" but A excluded.

Not possible.

""LUXER"" not word.

Perhaps ""DUVET"" not ending with ER.

I think we have to choose from the possible list.

Since ""UTTER"" is a common word, and ""METER"" is common, let's consider them.

But in ""UTTER"", T is in position 2 and 3, so if the secret has only one T, it might not be.

But we don't know.

From the feedback, in guess 3 ""tiger"", we had T in position 1 (misplaced), and I and G not in word, E and R correct.

So the secret has T, but not in 1, so in 2 or 3.

For the next guess, we can guess ""UTTER"" to test if T is in position 2 and if there is a U.

If we guess ""UTTER"":

- Position 1: U
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: E (fixed, will be ✓)
- Position 5: R (fixed, will be ✓)

Feedback:
- U: will be x if not in word, or - if in word but wrong position.
- T in position 2: if the secret has T in position 2, and only one T, then ✓, but if not, - or x.
- T in position 3: similarly.

But it might be messy.

Guess ""METER"": M E T E R

- Position 1: M
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: R (✓)

Feedback:
- M: x or -
- E in position 2: if E is also in position 2, then ✓, but if not, then - or x? But E is already in the word at position 4, so if E is not in position 2, we might get - for position 2 if E is only at 4, but since E is already known, if it's not in position 2, it might be x if no duplicate, but we don't know.

This is ambiguous.

To avoid duplication issues, perhaps guess a word without duplicate letters.

For example, for the pattern, with T in position 3, and new letters in 1 and 2 that are not E.

But from available, what word has [1][2] T E R with [1] and [2] not E and from available.

Like ""DU TER"" not.

""HA TER"" not.

""BA TER"" not.

""LY TER"" not.

""MY TER"" not.

""BY TER"" not.

""K Y TER"" not.

It seems impossible to find a word without using E in position 2 or having excluded letters.

Therefore, we might have to accept that E could be duplicated or T could be duplicated.

Perhaps the secret word is ""UTTER"".

Or ""DETER"", etc.

Another possibility: ""THYME"" not ending with ER.

I think we should guess ""UTTER"" because it tests U and the position of T.

So let's go with ""UTTER"".

Guess: UTTER

But in ""UTTER"", we have U in 1, T in 2, T in 3, E in 4, R in 5.

We know E and R will be correct.

If the secret is ""UTTER"", we win.

If not, feedback will help.

For example, if U is not in the word, we get U(x), T in 2 might be - or ✓, T in 3 similarly.

But it might give us information.

If we get T(✓) in position 2, then T is in 2, and position 3 might be something else.

But let's do it.

So fourth guess: UTTER

<guess>utter</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - C (x): Not in the word.
     - R (-): In the word, but wrong position (not position 2).
     - A (x): Not in the word.
     - N (x): Not in the word.
     - E (-): In the word, but wrong position (not position 5).
   - **Guess 2 (""pores"")**:
     - P (x): Not in the word.
     - O (x): Not in the word.
     - R (-): In the word, but wrong position (not position 3).
     - E (✓): Correct position (position 4).
     - S (x): Not in the word.
   - **Guess 3 (""tiger"")**:
     - T (-): In the word, but wrong position (not position 1).
     - I (x): Not in the word.
     - G (x): Not in the word.
     - E (✓): Correct position (position 4).
     - R (✓): Correct position (position 5).

2. **Consolidate Known Information**:
   - **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:
     - E is fixed in position 4.
     - R is fixed in position 5.
   - **Misplaced Letters**:
     - T is in the word but not in position 1. It must be in position 2 or 3.
   - **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, P, O, S, I, G (not in the word).
   - **Available Letters**: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word is `[letter1][letter2][letter3] E R`, with T in position 2 or 3.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Focus on resolving the position of T (position 2 or 3) and identifying the remaining letters.
   - Use a word that:
     - Retains E in position 4 and R in position 5 (fixed).
     - Tests T in position 2 (to confirm or rule it out).
     - Uses new, common letters from the available set for other positions to maximize information.
     - Avoids excluded letters and minimizes letter repetition.
   - ""UTTER"" is chosen because:
     - It tests T in position 2 (if T is correct here, it resolves its position; if not, T must be in position 3).
     - It tests U in position 1 (a new, common vowel).
     - It uses T in position 3 as well (which may help if T is duplicated, or provide feedback on position 3).
     - It fits the structure `U T T E R`, with E and R fixed.
     - All letters are valid (U and T are available; E and R are confirmed).
   - If ""UTTER"" is incorrect, feedback on U and the T positions will narrow down possibilities significantly (e.g., if U is absent, or if T is misplaced in position 2/3).

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If T is in position 2, feedback may show T(✓) for position 2.
   - If T is only in position 3, feedback may show T(-) for position 2 and T(✓) for position 3 (or other combinations).
   - Feedback on U will indicate if it is in the word.

<guess>utter</guess>",utter,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane""
- C: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- A: x (not in word)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: ""pores""
- P: x (not in word)
- O: x (not in word)
- R: - (in word, wrong position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)
- S: x (not in word)

Guess 3: ""tiger""
- T: - (in word, wrong position)
- I: x (not in word)
- G: x (not in word)
- E: ✓ (correct position) [this is position 4]
- R: ✓ (correct position) [this is position 5]

Now, from the feedback:

1. E is confirmed in position 4 (from guess 2 and 3).
2. R is now confirmed in position 5 (from guess 3, since we got ✓ for R in position 5).
   - Previously, R was misplaced in position 2 (guess 1) and position 3 (guess 2), so now we know R is fixed at position 5.

Additionally, from guess 3:
- T is in the word but not in position 1 (since we got T(-) for position 1).
- I is not in the word (x).
- G is not in the word (x).

Also, from previous guesses, we have excluded letters: C, A, N, P, O, S, I, G.

So excluded letters: C, A, N, P, O, S, I, G.

We also know that the secret word has:
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R
- And T is in the word, but not in position 1.

The word structure: [letter1] [letter2] [letter3] E R

We need to find the first three letters, with T being one of them (but not in position 1), and the other two from the remaining available letters.

Available letters (not excluded and not already placed): 
Excluded: C, A, N, P, O, S, I, G.
We also have E and R placed, so we don't need to consider them for the missing positions.

Available: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

But T is in the word, so T must be in one of positions 2 or 3 (since not in 1).

So the word has T in position 2 or 3, and two other letters from the available set in the remaining positions.

We have two positions to fill: 1, 2, 3, but T is in 2 or 3, so:
- If T is in position 2, then positions 1 and 3 are two other letters.
- If T is in position 3, then positions 1 and 2 are two other letters.

We need to make a guess that helps us find the missing letters and the position of T.

We have 3 guesses left (since 3 used, total 6).

For the next guess, we should try to cover common letters and positions.

We know the word ends with ""ER"".

Common words ending with ""ER"": like water, later, but A is excluded; other: maker, but A excluded; user, but S excluded; under, etc.

But we have constraints.

We can try to guess a word that has T in position 2 or 3, and uses common letters for the other positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we might want to test multiple possibilities.

But we can also try to confirm the position of T.

Let's list possible words that fit the pattern and constraints.

The word: [1] [2] [3] E R

Constraints:
- T is in the word, but not in position 1, so in 2 or 3.
- The letters in positions 1,2,3 must be from available: B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and T (but T only in 2 or 3).

Also, the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words:

First, if T is in position 2: [1] T [3] E R

Then [1] and [3] from available: B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Examples:
- ""UTTER"": U T T E R -> but has two T's? And U is available. But we don't know if T appears twice. Also, position 3 is T, which is the same as position 2? But in the secret, T might be only once? We don't know. But ""UTTER"" has T in 2 and 3, so if the secret has only one T, it might not be good. But we know T is in the word, but we don't know the count.

- ""UTTER"" might be possible, but let's see other options.

- ""ALTER"": but A excluded.

- ""ENTER"": E in position 1? But we have E in position 4, and ""ENTER"" has E in 1 and 4? 1:E, 2:N, 3:T, 4:E, 5:R -> but N excluded, and E in 1st? But we have E in 4th, but if E is also in 1st, it might be possible, but N is excluded.

- ""OTHER"": O excluded.

- ""UNDER"": U N D E R -> N excluded.

- ""UPPER"": P excluded.

- ""OFFER"": O and F? O excluded.

- ""EATER"": A excluded.

- ""METER"": M E T E R -> but E in 1st? 1:M,2:E,3:T,4:E,5:R. But E is in 2nd and 4th? We know E is in 4th, but if E is also in 2nd, it might be possible. But in this case, position 2 is E, which we don't know about. Also, M is available. But ""METER"" has E in 2nd, which is a new position. However, we are not sure if E is duplicated.

But we have to consider that E might be duplicated? But in the feedback so far, we only know one E is in position 4. There could be more.

Similarly, for T, we know it's present, but not how many.

But to be safe, let's avoid assuming duplicates for now.

Another word: ""HUTER"" not a word.

""BUTER"" not a word.

""LATER"" A excluded.

""MATER"" A excluded.

""VOTER"" O excluded.

""FUTER"" not a word.

""KITER"" K I T E R -> I excluded? I is excluded from guess 3 (I:x). So I cannot be used.

Available letters: B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

So for [1] T [3] E R:

- ""HATER"" A excluded.

""BITER"" B I T E R -> I excluded.

""LITER"" L I T E R -> I excluded.

""MITER"" M I T E R -> I excluded.

""RUTER"" not common.

""TUTOR"" O excluded and T in 1st? Not, we are assuming T in 2nd.

Perhaps ""DUTER"" not a word.

""FUTER"" not.

Maybe ""MUTER"" not common.

""OUTER"" O excluded.

It's hard to find with T in 2nd.

Now, try T in position 3: [1] [2] T E R

Then [1] and [2] from available: B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Examples:
- ""BATTER"" but A excluded and two T's? 6 letters? ""BATTER"" is 6? B-A-T-T-E-R, 6 letters. No, 5: B1, A2, T3, T4, E5? No, positions: 1:B,2:A,3:T,4:E,5:R? But A excluded, and E should be in 4th? In ""BATER"" not a word.

- ""DATER"" A excluded.

- ""HATER"" A excluded.

- ""LATER"" A excluded.

- ""MATER"" A excluded.

- ""WATER"" A excluded.

- ""MITER"" but I excluded.

- ""LITRE"" L I T R E -> but I excluded, and positions: 1:L,2:I,3:T,4:R,5:E -> but we need E in 4th and R in 5th, here R is in 4th and E in 5th, not matching.

We need the pattern: [1][2]T E R, so position 3:T, 4:E, 5:R.

So words like:
- ""AFTER"" A excluded.
- ""ENTER"" E in 1st and N excluded.
- ""UNTER"" not common.
- ""INTER"" I excluded.
- ""OUTER"" O excluded.
- ""UPTER"" not a word.

""ALTER"" A excluded.

Perhaps ""DETER"": D E T E R -> 1:D,2:E,3:T,4:E,5:R. But E in 2nd and 4th? And D available. But we have E in 2nd, which might be possible.

Similarly, ""METER"": M E T E R, same as above.

""FETER"" not common.

""HEXER"": H E X E R -> E in 2nd and 4th.

But we don't know if E is duplicated.

Another possibility: ""DIVER"": D I V E R -> but I excluded.

""LIVER"" I excluded.

""COVER"" C and O excluded.

""MAKER"" A excluded.

""BAKER"" A excluded.

""JOKER"" O excluded.

""TOWER"" O excluded.

""SUPER"" S excluded.

""DUVET"" not ending with ER.

Perhaps we need to consider that T might not be the only letter, and we have to use the available letters.

List of possible words ending with ""TER"" (since position 3 is T, then E R, so the last three are T E R, so the word ends with ""TER"", but not necessarily, because position 3 is T, 4 is E, 5 is R, so the suffix is ""TER"", but ""TER"" as in T-E-R.

Common words ending with ""TER"": like after, alter, but A issues; enter, but E in 1st;  etc.

But with available letters, what about ""HUTER"" not word.

""LUTER"" not.

""KITTER"" has two T's and 6 letters.

Perhaps ""BUTLER"" is 6.

Maybe we missed some words.

Another idea: ""DEUCE"" not ending with ER.

Perhaps ""QUEER"" but Q and two E's: Q U E E R -> 1:Q,2:U,3:E,4:E,5:R. But position 4 is E, which is good, but position 3 is E? But we need position 3 to be T? No, in this case for T in position 3, we need [1][2]T E R, so position 3 is T.

In ""QUEER"", position 3 is E, not T.

Not matching.

Perhaps ""T is in position 2"" is more likely, but we had trouble finding words.

From guess 3, we have T in the word but not in position 1, so it must be in 2 or 3.

But in the secret word, position 4 is E, position 5 is R, so the first three letters are to be found.

We know T is one of them, in position 2 or 3.

Also, from available letters.

Perhaps we can guess a word that has T in position 2 or 3, and uses common letters for the other positions.

For example, let's put T in position 2 for the guess.

So guess: [1] T [3] E R

But E and R are fixed, so we need to choose [1] and [3] from available letters.

Available: B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common choices: U, D, L, M, etc.

Word: ""UTTER"" - but has two T's. If we guess ""UTTER"", it has U in 1, T in 2, T in 3, E in 4, R in 5.

But we know E and R are fixed, so feedback will tell us about U and the T's.

If the secret has only one T, then position 2 or 3 might be wrong.

But it's a valid guess to test.

Another word: ""METER"" but E in 2nd, which is not T.

"" DETER"": D E T E R -> E in 2nd, not T.

For position 2 to be T, we need a letter where the second letter is T.

Like ""UTERI"" not 5 letters.

""UTERUS"" too long.

Perhaps ""T is in position 3"" and we use ""DATER"" but A excluded.

I think we have to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters, or we might need to use a word that tests multiple things.

Another idea: since T is in the word and not in 1, we can guess a word with T in position 3 and two new letters in 1 and 2.

For example, ""HA TER"" not, ""HATER"" A excluded.

""LATER"" A excluded.

""MATER"" A excluded.

""WATER"" A excluded.

""BAKER"" A excluded.

All have A, which is excluded.

""F number"" not.

Perhaps ""DIVER"" but I excluded.

""LIKER"" I excluded.

""MAKER"" A excluded.

It's difficult.

Let's list all possible 5-letter words ending with ""ER"" that have E in 4th and R in 5th, and no excluded letters, and T in the word.

Excluded letters: C,A,N,P,O,S,I,G

So the word must contain T, and T in position 2 or 3.

Position 4 and 5 are E and R fixed.

So the word is: [1][2][3] E R

With [1], [2], [3] from B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z and T in [2] or [3].

Possible combinations:

For T in [2]: [1] T [3] E R

[1] and [3] from B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Possible words:
- ""UTTER"" - U T T E R
- ""BUTLER"" too long.
- ""MUTER"" not common, but ""MUTER"" is not a standard word; ""muter"" is not common, usually ""mutter"" which is 6 letters.
- ""HUTED"" not.
- ""CITER"" C excluded.
- ""DIT R"" not.

Only ""UTTER"" seems common.

For T in [3]: [1][2] T E R

[1] and [2] from B,D,F,H,K,L,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

Possible words:
- ""DATER"" A excluded.
- ""HATER"" A excluded.
- ""LATER"" A excluded.
- ""MATER"" A excluded.
- ""WATER"" A excluded.
- ""BITER"" I excluded.
- ""LITER"" I excluded.
- ""MITER"" I excluded.
- ""TITER"" I excluded and T in 1st? T I T E R -> T in 1 and 3, I excluded.
- ""DETER"" D E T E R -> E in 2nd, which is not from available for [2], but E is already in the word, so it could be, but position 2 is E, which is a letter, but we are to use available letters, and E is not in the available list for new letters, but E is already known, so it could be duplicated.

In ""DETER"", we have D in 1, E in 2, T in 3, E in 4, R in 5.

So position 2 is E, which is the same as position 4.

But we know E is in position 4, but it might be in position 2 as well.

Similarly, ""METER"" M E T E R.

""FETER"" F E T E R.

""HEXER"" H E X E R.

""JEWER"" not.

""KEXES"" not.

""VET ER"" not.

So possible words: ""DETER"", ""METER"", ""FETER"" (less common), ""HEXER"" (less common).

Also, ""BEWER"" not.

""LEVER"" but E in 2nd and position, but L E V E R, V available, but E in 2nd.

But ""LEVER"" has V.

Similarly, ""FEVER"" F E V E R.

But in ""FEVER"", position 3 is V, not T.

We need position 3 to be T for this case.

For T in position 3, we need [1][2] T E R, so position 3 is T.

In ""DETER"", position 3 is T, position 2 is E.

Similarly for ""METER"".

So ""DETER"" and ""METER"" are valid.

Also, ""RETER"" not common.

""SETER"" S excluded.

So the possible secret words could be:
- ""UTTER"" (T in position 2 and 3)
- ""DETER"" (T in position 3, E in position 2)
- ""METER"" (T in position 3, E in position 2)
- ""FETER"" (less common)
- ""HEXER"" (less common)

But we have to guess one.

Since we have to make a guess, we can choose one that distinguishes.

For example, if we guess ""DETER"", it will tell us if it's correct or not.

But we can also guess a word that tests the position of T and other letters.

Another idea: guess a word that has T in position 3 and uses new letters for 1 and 2.

For example, ""HATER"" but A excluded.

Not possible.

""LUXER"" not word.

Perhaps ""DUVET"" not ending with ER.

I think we have to choose from the possible list.

Since ""UTTER"" is a common word, and ""METER"" is common, let's consider them.

But in ""UTTER"", T is in position 2 and 3, so if the secret has only one T, it might not be.

But we don't know.

From the feedback, in guess 3 ""tiger"", we had T in position 1 (misplaced), and I and G not in word, E and R correct.

So the secret has T, but not in 1, so in 2 or 3.

For the next guess, we can guess ""UTTER"" to test if T is in position 2 and if there is a U.

If we guess ""UTTER"":

- Position 1: U
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: E (fixed, will be ✓)
- Position 5: R (fixed, will be ✓)

Feedback:
- U: will be x if not in word, or - if in word but wrong position.
- T in position 2: if the secret has T in position 2, and only one T, then ✓, but if not, - or x.
- T in position 3: similarly.

But it might be messy.

Guess ""METER"": M E T E R

- Position 1: M
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: E (✓)
- Position 5: R (✓)

Feedback:
- M: x or -
- E in position 2: if E is also in position 2, then ✓, but if not, then - or x? But E is already in the word at position 4, so if E is not in position 2, we might get - for position 2 if E is only at 4, but since E is already known, if it's not in position 2, it might be x if no duplicate, but we don't know.

This is ambiguous.

To avoid duplication issues, perhaps guess a word without duplicate letters.

For example, for the pattern, with T in position 3, and new letters in 1 and 2 that are not E.

But from available, what word has [1][2] T E R with [1] and [2] not E and from available.

Like ""DU TER"" not.

""HA TER"" not.

""BA TER"" not.

""LY TER"" not.

""MY TER"" not.

""BY TER"" not.

""K Y TER"" not.

It seems impossible to find a word without using E in position 2 or having excluded letters.

Therefore, we might have to accept that E could be duplicated or T could be duplicated.

Perhaps the secret word is ""UTTER"".

Or ""DETER"", etc.

Another possibility: ""THYME"" not ending with ER.

I think we should guess ""UTTER"" because it tests U and the position of T.

So let's go with ""UTTER"".

Guess: UTTER

But in ""UTTER"", we have U in 1, T in 2, T in 3, E in 4, R in 5.

We know E and R will be correct.

If the secret is ""UTTER"", we win.

If not, feedback will help.

For example, if U is not in the word, we get U(x), T in 2 might be - or ✓, T in 3 similarly.

But it might give us information.

If we get T(✓) in position 2, then T is in 2, and position 3 might be something else.

But let's do it.

So fourth guess: UTTER

<guess>utter</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Feedback from Previous Guesses**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: 
     - C (x): Not in the word.
     - R (-): In the word, but wrong position (not position 2).
     - A (x): Not in the word.
     - N (x): Not in the word.
     - E (-): In the word, but wrong position (not position 5).
   - **Guess 2 (""pores"")**:
     - P (x): Not in the word.
     - O (x): Not in the word.
     - R (-): In the word, but wrong position (not position 3).
     - E (✓): Correct position (position 4).
     - S (x): Not in the word.
   - **Guess 3 (""tiger"")**:
     - T (-): In the word, but wrong position (not position 1).
     - I (x): Not in the word.
     - G (x): Not in the word.
     - E (✓): Correct position (position 4).
     - R (✓): Correct position (position 5).

2. **Consolidate Known Information**:
   - **Confirmed Letters & Positions**:
     - E is fixed in position 4.
     - R is fixed in position 5.
   - **Misplaced Letters**:
     - T is in the word but not in position 1. It must be in position 2 or 3.
   - **Excluded Letters**: C, A, N, P, O, S, I, G (not in the word).
   - **Available Letters**: B, D, F, H, K, L, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
   - **Word Structure**: The secret word is `[letter1][letter2][letter3] E R`, with T in position 2 or 3.

3. **Strategy for Next Guess**:
   - Focus on resolving the position of T (position 2 or 3) and identifying the remaining letters.
   - Use a word that:
     - Retains E in position 4 and R in position 5 (fixed).
     - Tests T in position 2 (to confirm or rule it out).
     - Uses new, common letters from the available set for other positions to maximize information.
     - Avoids excluded letters and minimizes letter repetition.
   - ""UTTER"" is chosen because:
     - It tests T in position 2 (if T is correct here, it resolves its position; if not, T must be in position 3).
     - It tests U in position 1 (a new, common vowel).
     - It uses T in position 3 as well (which may help if T is duplicated, or provide feedback on position 3).
     - It fits the structure `U T T E R`, with E and R fixed.
     - All letters are valid (U and T are available; E and R are confirmed).
   - If ""UTTER"" is incorrect, feedback on U and the T positions will narrow down possibilities significantly (e.g., if U is absent, or if T is misplaced in position 2/3).

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If T is in position 2, feedback may show T(✓) for position 2.
   - If T is only in position 3, feedback may show T(-) for position 2 and T(✓) for position 3 (or other combinations).
   - Feedback on U will indicate if it is in the word.",Guess 4: utter -> FEEDBACK: U(✓) T(✓) T(✓) E(✓) R(✓),SUCCESS
