We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> all letters are marked with 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Since none of these letters are in the word, we must avoid using any of the letters C, R, A, N, E in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 We should pick a word that uses common letters that haven't been tried yet. Common letters in English include S, T, O, I, L, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 Let's consider words that use these letters.

 Some options: 
 - ""south"": uses S, O, U, T, H
 - ""pilot"": uses P, I, L, O, T
 - ""built"": uses B, U, I, L, T
 - ""dumpy"": uses D, U, M, P, Y

 However, we also want to maximize the coverage of new letters.

 Let me think of more words without C,R,A,N,E.

 Another popular starting word that avoids these letters is ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T.

 But we can choose a word that uses more common letters.

 Consider ""point"": P, O, I, N, T ... but note we cannot use 'N' because it was excluded? Wait, feedback said N(x) meaning N is not in the word, so we should avoid N? Actually, in the feedback: ""N(x)"" meaning not in the word, so indeed we must avoid N.

 But wait: the feedback for ""crane"" was C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) -> so exclude C, R, A, N, E.

 Therefore, ""point"" has N, so that's not allowed.

 How about ""pilot""? P, I, L, O, T -> none of these are in the excluded list (C,R,A,N,E).

 Yes, that could be a good candidate.

 Also ""split"": S, P, L, I, T -> again, no excluded letters.

 However, let's check the commonality of letters.

 Alternatively, ""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> no excluded letters.

 But note we are not limited to just one word. We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common English letters (after removing C, R, A, N, E) might be: S, T, O, I, L, P, H, U, M, D, Y, W, F, G, etc.

 We can use a word that maximizes the usage of high frequency letters remaining.

 Since T and O are very common, perhaps ""toils"": T, O, I, L, S -> but wait, we are avoiding R, but R is excluded? Actually, R is excluded so that's okay.

 However, ""toils"" uses T, O, I, L, S -> all are allowed.

 But let me check if ""toils"" is a valid word? It is the plural of toil? In Wordle, plurals are sometimes allowed if they are common.

 Alternatively, ""spoil"": S, P, O, I, L -> same letters almost, but I thinks it's valid.

 Another option: ""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> also uses U and Y.

 We need to pick one. Let's try a word that includes S, T, O, L, I? Actually, we have limited spots.

 After excluding C,R,A,N,E, the most common letters are: S, T, O, I, L, P, etc.

 I'll pick ""spoil"" because it uses S, P, O, I, L which are all common.

 But note: S and O appear in many words. We are only on the second guess, so maximizing coverage is good.

 Another candidate is ""poult"" (a young bird) but that might be obscure? Better to use common words.

 A more popular word: ""shift"" -> S, H, I, F, T. But H and F are less common? It's acceptable.

 Or ""stomp"": S, T, O, M, P -> good letters, but O? Yes.

 However, to avoid potential duplication, let's choose ""pilot"" or ""split""?

 I think ""pilot"" is a good choice: letters P,I,L,O,T.

 Let me confirm: P not excluded? Yes. I, L, O, T are all not excluded? Correct.

 So I'll go with ""pilot"".

 But wait, what if we use a word that doesn't repeat any letters? ""pilot"" has unique letters.

 Alternatively, ""mouls"" is not common. Let's stick with a common word.

 Actually, ""pilot"" is a standard word.

 Therefore, I will guess ""pilot"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane""), none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, these letters must be avoided in the next guess. 

The new guess should include common letters not yet tested to maximize information. Suitable letters might include S, T, O, L, I, P, H, U, M, D, Y, etc. After evaluating options like ""spoil"" (S,P,O,I,L), ""split"" (S,P,L,I,T), ""pilot"" (P,I,L,O,T), and ""might"" (M,I,G,H,T), ""pilot"" is selected because:
- It uses 5 new, common letters: P, I, L, O, T
- It avoids excluded letters
- It is a valid English word with unique letters

We are only on the second guess, so maximizing coverage is good.\n\n Another candidate is ""poult"" (a young bird) but that might be obscure? Better to use common words.\n\n A more popular word: ""shift"" -> S, H, I, F, T. But H and F are less common? It\'s acceptable.\n\n Or ""stomp"": S, T, O, M, P -> good letters, but O? Yes.\n\n However, to avoid potential duplication, let\'s choose ""pilot"" or ""split""?\n\n I think ""pilot"" is a good choice: letters P,I,L,O,T.\n\n Let me confirm: P not excluded? Yes. I, L, O, T are all not excluded? Correct.\n\n So I\'ll go with ""pilot"".\n\n But wait, what if we use a word that doesn\'t repeat any letters? ""pilot"" has unique letters.\n\n Alternatively, ""mouls"" is not common. Let\'s stick with a common word.\n\n Actually, ""pilot"" is a standard word.\n\n Therefore, I will guess ""pilot"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane""), none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, these letters must be avoided in the next guess. \n\nThe new guess should include common letters not yet tested to maximize information. Suitable letters might include S, T, O, L, I, P, H, U, M, D, Y, etc. After evaluating options like ""spoil"" (S,P,O,I,L), ""split"" (S,P,L,I,T), ""pilot"" (P,I,L,O,T), and ""might"" (M,I,G,H,T), ""pilot"" is selected because:\n- It uses 5 new, common letters: P, I, L, O, T\n- It avoids excluded letters\n- It is a valid English word with unique letters\n\n<guess>pilot</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: pilot -> FEEDBACK: P(-) I(-) L(-) O(x) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:
1. First guess ""crane"": all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are marked with 'x', meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.
2. Second guess ""pilot"": 
   - P is marked with '-', meaning P is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - I is marked with '-', meaning I is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - L is marked with '-', meaning L is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - O and T are marked with 'x', meaning they are not in the word.

From the feedback of ""pilot"":
- The secret word contains the letters P, I, and L, but NOT O or T.
- Also, note from the first guess, we know C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.

So, we have:
- Confirmed letters in the word: P, I, L.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, T.

We must use a word that contains P, I, and L, and avoids the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,O,T.

Additionally, we know that all three letters P, I, L are in the secret word but in the wrong position as per the guess ""pilot"". 
- In ""pilot"", P was in position 1, I in position 2, L in position 3. But these positions are wrong for each of them.

Therefore, for the next guess:
- We need a 5-letter word that includes P, I, L (all must be present) and two other letters that are not excluded.
- The positions of P, I, L must not be the same as in ""pilot"" (i.e., P cannot be in position 1, I cannot be in position 2, L cannot be in position 3).

Excluded Letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, T.

Available Letters: We can use letters from the alphabet except these excluded ones. Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a word with P, I, L and two other letters from the available set.

We must choose a word where:
- P is not in position 1
- I is not in position 2
- L is not in position 3

We need to choose a word that rearranges P, I, L and includes two new letters.

Common letters to try: S, U, M, H, etc.

Possible words containing P, I, L:
- We need to position P, L, I in other indices.

Consider possible placements:

Example: 
- Position 1: cannot be P (because in ""pilot"" P was in pos1 and it was wrong). So pos1 must be a new letter.
- Similarly, pos2 cannot be I, and pos3 cannot be L.

So, the positions for P: must be in 2,3,4,5? But wait, in the word, P can be in any position except 1? Actually, the feedback says P is in the word but not in position 1. So P could be in 2,3,4,5. But note that if we put P in position 3, that might be okay because in ""pilot"" position 3 was L, not P.

Similarly for I: cannot be in position 2, so it can be in 1,3,4,5.
For L: cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1,2,4,5.

Now, we want to cover more letters. Let's think of words.

Some candidate words:
- ""spilt"": contains S,P,I,L,T -> but T is excluded? We have excluded T (from ""pilot"" T was marked 'x'). So ""spilt"" has T which is excluded -> invalid.

Alternative: ""split"": S,P,L,I,T -> again T excluded -> invalid.

We cannot use T. So let's avoid T.

What about ""blimp"": B,L,I,M,P -> letters: B, L, I, M, P. 
- Check excluded letters: none of these are in C,R,A,N,E,O,T -> okay.
- Positions: 
   - B in pos1, 
   - L in pos2 (but wait: L cannot be in position 3? But position 2 for L is okay? The constraint for L is that it cannot be in position 3 (from the feedback of ""pilot""). So position 2 is allowed? Yes, because the feedback only says that in position 3 it was wrong, but L is in the word and can be in another position.

Similarly, P was previously in position1 and was wrong, so now we put P in position5? Okay. 
I was previously in position2 and wrong, now in position3? That's a different position? But we don't know if position3 is correct? The feedback only says that in position2 it was wrong, but it can be in position3? Actually, it's allowed to be in position3 because the previous feedback was only about position2.

Wait, the feedback for I: it's in the word but not in position2. It can be in any other position. Same for L: not in position3, so it can be in others.

But note: the word ""blimp"": 
   pos1: B (new)
   pos2: L -> L is in position2: acceptable? Yes, since L was only forbidden from position3.
   pos3: I -> I is in position3: acceptable? Yes, because I was only forbidden from position2.
   pos4: M (new)
   pos5: P -> P is in position5: acceptable? Yes, because P was forbidden from position1.

So ""blimp"" is a candidate.

But is ""blimp"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a light airship.

Another candidate: ""guild"" but does not have P? We must have P.

We need P, I, L.

Another possibility: ""plink"" -> P,L,I,N,K -> but N is excluded (from first guess). Invalid.

""flips"": F,L,I,P,S -> letters: F, L, I, P, S. 
- Avoids excluded? Let's check: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,O,T. F,L,I,P,S are all allowed.
- Positions:
   ""flips"": 
        pos1: F -> new
        pos2: L -> L in pos2: allowed? Yes, since L cannot be in pos3 only? Actually, the feedback doesn't prevent L from being in pos2.
        pos3: I -> I in pos3: but I cannot be in pos2? That doesn't forbid pos3. So okay.
        pos4: P -> P in pos4: okay (not pos1)
        pos5: S -> new
But note: the feedback for ""pilot"" said P is in the word but not in pos1, I not in pos2, L not in pos3. This arrangement meets that.

So ""flips"" is also a candidate.

Another: ""slipp"" not a word.

""spill"": S,P,I,L,L -> but duplicate L? Not allowed? Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters, but here ""spill"" has two L's. But we must be cautious because we don't know if the word has duplicate L. However, in the feedback from ""pilot"", L was marked as '-' meaning at least one L is present. It doesn't tell us if there are more.

But ""spill"" is S,P,I,L,L. Now, S and L are the new letters? But we don't know if L may appear twice? We can't be sure. Also, ""spill"" has L in position 4 and 5? But position5: L. But we don't know if L can be in other positions? Actually, the feedback doesn't forbid multiple L.

But note: we know that L is in the word, but we don't know the count. So words with two L might be possible.

However, we have two L's in ""spill"". Let's check if it violates.

But in the feedback for ""pilot"": we had only one L and it was in position3 and wrong. So if the word has two L's, one might be in another position? We don't know.

But we are guessing, it's acceptable. However, let's see other words.

""milks"": M,I,L,K,S -> has K and S. But does it have P? No, we need P? Yes, P is required.

We must have P.

So we need a word that contains P, I, L. Both ""flips"" and ""blimp"" are candidates.

Another candidate: ""hipsy""? Not common. ""lipid""? L,I,P,I,D -> has two I's? And D. But we can check: L in pos1? Then I in pos2? But I cannot be in pos2? Because in ""pilot"", I was in pos2 and was wrong? So if we guess ""lipid"": 
   pos1: L (allowed? L forbidden only in pos3 -> okay)
   pos2: I -> forbidden! Because in the feedback, I cannot be in pos2. So we must not put I in pos2.

Thus, ""lipid"" is invalid because it puts I in pos2.

Similarly, any word putting I in pos2 is invalid.

In ""flips"": 
   pos1: F (new)
   pos2: L -> allowed? Since L is not forbidden from pos2, only from pos3 -> okay.
   pos3: I -> allowed? Because I was forbidden from pos2? Then pos3 is allowed? Yes.
   pos4: P -> allowed (not pos1)
   pos5: S (new)

So that seems fine. 

But wait, what about P: in ""pilot"" we put P in pos1 and wrong, so putting P in pos4 is okay? Yes.

Similarly, L: in ""pilot"" was in pos3 and wrong, so here in pos2 is okay? Yes.

I: in ""pilot"" was in pos2 and wrong, so in pos3 is okay? Yes.

So ""flips"" is valid.

Similarly, ""blimp"" was valid.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid, so we can pick either. Let's choose the one that uses more common letters or covers letters we haven't tried.

In ""blimp"": uses B, L, I, M, P. The new letters are B and M. We haven't tried B, M.

In ""flips"": uses F, L, I, P, S. The new letters are F and S.

S is a very common letter, so perhaps ""flips"" might be better to cover S.

Also, note that we might need to consider the pattern.

Another possibility: ""slyly"" but no P,I,L.

So I think ""flips"" is a good choice because S is common and F is less common but we cover it.

But note: the feedback might reveal positions.

So I'll select ""flips"".

However, let me see if there are words that have P, I, L and use even more common letters? For example, with H or U.

""build"" no P. ""phial"" -> P,H,I,A,L -> but A is excluded? From first guess, A is excluded? Yes, we saw A(x). So we cannot use A. ""phial"" has A -> excluded -> invalid.

""quipf"" not a word.

So I think ""flips"" is acceptable.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on guess 3.

Another candidate: ""wimp"": too short. Not 5 letters.

""plink"" had N -> excluded.

""blips"": B,L,I,P,S -> same as ""blimp"" but with S instead of M? Actually, ""blips"" is a word? It is the plural of blip? Yes.

""blips"": 
   pos1: B
   pos2: L -> allowed? L forbidden in pos3, so pos2 okay.
   pos3: I -> but I is forbidden in position 2? Then what about pos3? That's allowed. But note: if we put I in pos3, that's allowed. And L in pos2 is allowed.
   pos4: P -> okay (not pos1)
   pos5: S

But we must avoid putting L in pos3? No, L is forbidden only from pos3? Exactly, so we cannot put L in pos3? Wait, the feedback says L is in the word but not in pos3. So when we guess, we must not put L in pos3 because we know it's not there. Therefore, if we use a word that has L in pos3, that would be incorrect? Actually, no: the feedback tells us that in the secret word, L is not in pos3. Therefore, we must avoid putting L in pos3 because we know that position is incorrect. So if we put L in pos3, it would be explicitly against the feedback? Yes.

So in ""blips"", L is in pos2? Then it's okay? Yes.

Actually, ""blips"" has:
   pos1: B
   pos2: L (okay, because not pos3)
   pos3: I (okay, because not pos2)
   pos4: P (okay, because not pos1)
   pos5: S

So ""blips"" is also valid.

Between ""flips"", ""blimp"", and ""blips"": 

- ""flips"": letters F, L, I, P, S
- ""blimp"": B, L, I, M, P
- ""blips"": B, L, I, P, S

We might want to cover S because it's common, so ""blips"" or ""flips"". 

But ""blips"" uses B,L,I,P,S: same as ""blips"", so S is common? Yes.

Alternatively, since we are going to cover S in one of them, we can choose.

Let me pick ""blips"" because it uses B and S, and we avoid F which might be less common? Actually, both are good.

But note: we also want to check the positions: 

In the secret word, we know that P, I, L must be in positions different from ""pilot"". However, we don't have information about their correct placements yet. So we want to rearrange them to potential places.

We have to try a configuration we haven't guessed.

Positions:
In ""pilot"": P at 1, I at 2, L at 3 -> all wrong.

Now, in our next guess, let's assume we assign the positions arbitrarily? We can. 

Since we don't know, we could consider assigning I to position 3, L to position 2, P to position 4? As in ""blips""? That mixes them around.

Similarly, ""flips"" does: P at 4, I at 3, L at 2.

Actually, same rearrangement: L at 2, I at 3, P at 4.

So both ""blips"" and ""flips"" have L at 2, I at 3, P at 4. ""blimp"" has L at 2, I at 3, P at 5 (because ""blimp"" is B L I M P).

We could try a different permutation? 

For example, put L at position 1? 
To minimize conflict? 

But we don't know. 

Consider ""lipid"" -> but we cannot have I at 2, so that was invalid.

""pils"": not 5 letters.

""spild"" not a word.

""milp""? not word.

A word with L at 1: ""lip?"" too short. ""lumps"" -> L,U,M,P,S? But U? We haven't excluded U? 
""lumps"": L,U,M,P,S -> letters: L,U,M,P,S? We need I? We must have I? Because I is in the word, so without I? So ""lumps"" doesn't have I -> invalid.

Therefore, we must have I, so L at 1 and I? Then I must be at 3 or 4 or 5? But if we put L at 1, I at 3, we can't put L at 1? Why not? It's allowed? We have no feedback against L at 1.

But the word must contain P somewhere? 

Example: ""lip"" is too short.

""lipid"" was invalid because I must not be at 2.

Another word with L at 1: ""lysis"" no P.

""limps"": L,I,M,P,S -> 
   positions: 
     L at 1 -> okay? 
     I at 2 -> not okay? Because I cannot be at position2? 
        Therefore, putting I at position2 is explicitly against the feedback? So we cannot do that.

So if we have L at 1? Then where to put I? We can put I at 3,4,5? 

Example: ""lp"" not a word. It's hard to get a word with L at 1 and I not at 2? But then a word like ""livid"" but V and I? And D is available? ""livid"": L,I,V,I,D -> has two I's? 
But does it have P? No, P is required.

""pulps"" -> P,U,L,P,S -> duplicate P? And no I? So loses I.

Therefore, it's difficult to have L at position 1 without putting I at an improper position? Not exactly, but we must have I somewhere? 

Actually, if we put L at 1, we need I at 3,4, or5? And P at any except1? 

But P was forbidden from pos1, so we can put P at 2,3,4,5? 

For example: 
   Position 1: L
   Position 2: P -> allowed? Because P forbidden only from pos1? So yes.
   Position 3: I -> allowed? Because I forbidden only from pos2? Yes, so pos3 is okay.

But is there a word ""lpi"" not a word? 

Words? ""lapin"" excluded A and N.
""lapel"" excluded A and E? A excluded.

How about ""linux"" -> L,I,N,U,X -> N excluded? Invalid.

""lipid"" had I at2? That's forbidden.

But if we put I at position4? 

Example: ""lumpi"" not standard? 

So I think it's more efficient to go with either ""blips"" or ""flips"".

Since ""blips"" uses B and S, which are common, and ""flips"" uses F and S? Both S? Or ""blimp"" uses M...

But S is more common than M or F? So let's choose S.

Between ""blips"" and ""flips"": 
   ""blips"" uses B (less common) and ""flips"" uses F (also less common)? But S is common to both? Actually, ""blips"" uses B,L,I,P,S and ""flips"" uses F,L,I,P,S. Both have S? Yes.

But we don't have any information about S? So we might want to test it.

Therefore, either is fine.

I choose ""flips"": FLIPS (verb form of flip? Yes).
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From ""pilot"": 
  - P, I, L are in the word but in the wrong positions (P, I, L cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively).
  - O and T are not in the word.

The secret word must contain P, I, L and avoid the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, O, T). For the next guess:
- Must include P, I, L (in positions other than 1, 2, 3 as previously used).
- Letters must be chosen from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word should test new common letters to gather more positional information.

The word ""flips"" (F, L, I, P, S) is appropriate because:
- Contains the required P, I, L.
- Avoids excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, T.
- Positions reposition P, I, L: 
  - L at position 2 (not position 3, where it was incorrect before).
  - I at position 3 (not position 2, where it was incorrect before).
  - P at position 4 (not position 1, where it was incorrect before).
- Introduces new common letters: F and S (S is high-frequency).

<guess>flips</guess>",flips,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. First guess ""crane"": all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are marked with 'x', meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.
2. Second guess ""pilot"": 
   - P is marked with '-', meaning P is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - I is marked with '-', meaning I is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - L is marked with '-', meaning L is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - O and T are marked with 'x', meaning they are not in the word.

From the feedback of ""pilot"":
- The secret word contains the letters P, I, and L, but NOT O or T.
- Also, note from the first guess, we know C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.

So, we have:
- Confirmed letters in the word: P, I, L.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, T.

We must use a word that contains P, I, and L, and avoids the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,O,T.

Additionally, we know that all three letters P, I, L are in the secret word but in the wrong position as per the guess ""pilot"". 
- In ""pilot"", P was in position 1, I in position 2, L in position 3. But these positions are wrong for each of them.

Therefore, for the next guess:
- We need a 5-letter word that includes P, I, L (all must be present) and two other letters that are not excluded.
- The positions of P, I, L must not be the same as in ""pilot"" (i.e., P cannot be in position 1, I cannot be in position 2, L cannot be in position 3).

Excluded Letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, T.

Available Letters: We can use letters from the alphabet except these excluded ones. Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a word with P, I, L and two other letters from the available set.

We must choose a word where:
- P is not in position 1
- I is not in position 2
- L is not in position 3

We need to choose a word that rearranges P, I, L and includes two new letters.

Common letters to try: S, U, M, H, etc.

Possible words containing P, I, L:
- We need to position P, L, I in other indices.

Consider possible placements:

Example: 
- Position 1: cannot be P (because in ""pilot"" P was in pos1 and it was wrong). So pos1 must be a new letter.
- Similarly, pos2 cannot be I, and pos3 cannot be L.

So, the positions for P: must be in 2,3,4,5? But wait, in the word, P can be in any position except 1? Actually, the feedback says P is in the word but not in position 1. So P could be in 2,3,4,5. But note that if we put P in position 3, that might be okay because in ""pilot"" position 3 was L, not P.

Similarly for I: cannot be in position 2, so it can be in 1,3,4,5.
For L: cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1,2,4,5.

Now, we want to cover more letters. Let's think of words.

Some candidate words:
- ""spilt"": contains S,P,I,L,T -> but T is excluded? We have excluded T (from ""pilot"" T was marked 'x'). So ""spilt"" has T which is excluded -> invalid.

Alternative: ""split"": S,P,L,I,T -> again T excluded -> invalid.

We cannot use T. So let's avoid T.

What about ""blimp"": B,L,I,M,P -> letters: B, L, I, M, P. 
- Check excluded letters: none of these are in C,R,A,N,E,O,T -> okay.
- Positions: 
   - B in pos1, 
   - L in pos2 (but wait: L cannot be in position 3? But position 2 for L is okay? The constraint for L is that it cannot be in position 3 (from the feedback of ""pilot""). So position 2 is allowed? Yes, because the feedback only says that in position 3 it was wrong, but L is in the word and can be in another position.

Similarly, P was previously in position1 and was wrong, so now we put P in position5? Okay. 
I was previously in position2 and wrong, now in position3? That's a different position? But we don't know if position3 is correct? The feedback only says that in position2 it was wrong, but it can be in position3? Actually, it's allowed to be in position3 because the previous feedback was only about position2.

Wait, the feedback for I: it's in the word but not in position2. It can be in any other position. Same for L: not in position3, so it can be in others.

But note: the word ""blimp"": 
   pos1: B (new)
   pos2: L -> L is in position2: acceptable? Yes, since L was only forbidden from position3.
   pos3: I -> I is in position3: acceptable? Yes, because I was only forbidden from position2.
   pos4: M (new)
   pos5: P -> P is in position5: acceptable? Yes, because P was forbidden from position1.

So ""blimp"" is a candidate.

But is ""blimp"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a light airship.

Another candidate: ""guild"" but does not have P? We must have P.

We need P, I, L.

Another possibility: ""plink"" -> P,L,I,N,K -> but N is excluded (from first guess). Invalid.

""flips"": F,L,I,P,S -> letters: F, L, I, P, S. 
- Avoids excluded? Let's check: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,O,T. F,L,I,P,S are all allowed.
- Positions:
   ""flips"": 
        pos1: F -> new
        pos2: L -> L in pos2: allowed? Yes, since L cannot be in pos3 only? Actually, the feedback doesn't prevent L from being in pos2.
        pos3: I -> I in pos3: but I cannot be in pos2? That doesn't forbid pos3. So okay.
        pos4: P -> P in pos4: okay (not pos1)
        pos5: S -> new
But note: the feedback for ""pilot"" said P is in the word but not in pos1, I not in pos2, L not in pos3. This arrangement meets that.

So ""flips"" is also a candidate.

Another: ""slipp"" not a word.

""spill"": S,P,I,L,L -> but duplicate L? Not allowed? Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters, but here ""spill"" has two L's. But we must be cautious because we don't know if the word has duplicate L. However, in the feedback from ""pilot"", L was marked as '-' meaning at least one L is present. It doesn't tell us if there are more.

But ""spill"" is S,P,I,L,L. Now, S and L are the new letters? But we don't know if L may appear twice? We can't be sure. Also, ""spill"" has L in position 4 and 5? But position5: L. But we don't know if L can be in other positions? Actually, the feedback doesn't forbid multiple L.

But note: we know that L is in the word, but we don't know the count. So words with two L might be possible.

However, we have two L's in ""spill"". Let's check if it violates.

But in the feedback for ""pilot"": we had only one L and it was in position3 and wrong. So if the word has two L's, one might be in another position? We don't know.

But we are guessing, it's acceptable. However, let's see other words.

""milks"": M,I,L,K,S -> has K and S. But does it have P? No, we need P? Yes, P is required.

We must have P.

So we need a word that contains P, I, L. Both ""flips"" and ""blimp"" are candidates.

Another candidate: ""hipsy""? Not common. ""lipid""? L,I,P,I,D -> has two I's? And D. But we can check: L in pos1? Then I in pos2? But I cannot be in pos2? Because in ""pilot"", I was in pos2 and was wrong? So if we guess ""lipid"": 
   pos1: L (allowed? L forbidden only in pos3 -> okay)
   pos2: I -> forbidden! Because in the feedback, I cannot be in pos2. So we must not put I in pos2.

Thus, ""lipid"" is invalid because it puts I in pos2.

Similarly, any word putting I in pos2 is invalid.

In ""flips"": 
   pos1: F (new)
   pos2: L -> allowed? Since L is not forbidden from pos2, only from pos3 -> okay.
   pos3: I -> allowed? Because I was forbidden from pos2? Then pos3 is allowed? Yes.
   pos4: P -> allowed (not pos1)
   pos5: S (new)

So that seems fine. 

But wait, what about P: in ""pilot"" we put P in pos1 and wrong, so putting P in pos4 is okay? Yes.

Similarly, L: in ""pilot"" was in pos3 and wrong, so here in pos2 is okay? Yes.

I: in ""pilot"" was in pos2 and wrong, so in pos3 is okay? Yes.

So ""flips"" is valid.

Similarly, ""blimp"" was valid.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid, so we can pick either. Let's choose the one that uses more common letters or covers letters we haven't tried.

In ""blimp"": uses B, L, I, M, P. The new letters are B and M. We haven't tried B, M.

In ""flips"": uses F, L, I, P, S. The new letters are F and S.

S is a very common letter, so perhaps ""flips"" might be better to cover S.

Also, note that we might need to consider the pattern.

Another possibility: ""slyly"" but no P,I,L.

So I think ""flips"" is a good choice because S is common and F is less common but we cover it.

But note: the feedback might reveal positions.

So I'll select ""flips"".

However, let me see if there are words that have P, I, L and use even more common letters? For example, with H or U.

""build"" no P. ""phial"" -> P,H,I,A,L -> but A is excluded? From first guess, A is excluded? Yes, we saw A(x). So we cannot use A. ""phial"" has A -> excluded -> invalid.

""quipf"" not a word.

So I think ""flips"" is acceptable.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on guess 3.

Another candidate: ""wimp"": too short. Not 5 letters.

""plink"" had N -> excluded.

""blips"": B,L,I,P,S -> same as ""blimp"" but with S instead of M? Actually, ""blips"" is a word? It is the plural of blip? Yes.

""blips"": 
   pos1: B
   pos2: L -> allowed? L forbidden in pos3, so pos2 okay.
   pos3: I -> but I is forbidden in position 2? Then what about pos3? That's allowed. But note: if we put I in pos3, that's allowed. And L in pos2 is allowed.
   pos4: P -> okay (not pos1)
   pos5: S

But we must avoid putting L in pos3? No, L is forbidden only from pos3? Exactly, so we cannot put L in pos3? Wait, the feedback says L is in the word but not in pos3. So when we guess, we must not put L in pos3 because we know it's not there. Therefore, if we use a word that has L in pos3, that would be incorrect? Actually, no: the feedback tells us that in the secret word, L is not in pos3. Therefore, we must avoid putting L in pos3 because we know that position is incorrect. So if we put L in pos3, it would be explicitly against the feedback? Yes.

So in ""blips"", L is in pos2? Then it's okay? Yes.

Actually, ""blips"" has:
   pos1: B
   pos2: L (okay, because not pos3)
   pos3: I (okay, because not pos2)
   pos4: P (okay, because not pos1)
   pos5: S

So ""blips"" is also valid.

Between ""flips"", ""blimp"", and ""blips"": 

- ""flips"": letters F, L, I, P, S
- ""blimp"": B, L, I, M, P
- ""blips"": B, L, I, P, S

We might want to cover S because it's common, so ""blips"" or ""flips"". 

But ""blips"" uses B,L,I,P,S: same as ""blips"", so S is common? Yes.

Alternatively, since we are going to cover S in one of them, we can choose.

Let me pick ""blips"" because it uses B and S, and we avoid F which might be less common? Actually, both are good.

But note: we also want to check the positions: 

In the secret word, we know that P, I, L must be in positions different from ""pilot"". However, we don't have information about their correct placements yet. So we want to rearrange them to potential places.

We have to try a configuration we haven't guessed.

Positions:
In ""pilot"": P at 1, I at 2, L at 3 -> all wrong.

Now, in our next guess, let's assume we assign the positions arbitrarily? We can. 

Since we don't know, we could consider assigning I to position 3, L to position 2, P to position 4? As in ""blips""? That mixes them around.

Similarly, ""flips"" does: P at 4, I at 3, L at 2.

Actually, same rearrangement: L at 2, I at 3, P at 4.

So both ""blips"" and ""flips"" have L at 2, I at 3, P at 4. ""blimp"" has L at 2, I at 3, P at 5 (because ""blimp"" is B L I M P).

We could try a different permutation? 

For example, put L at position 1? 
To minimize conflict? 

But we don't know. 

Consider ""lipid"" -> but we cannot have I at 2, so that was invalid.

""pils"": not 5 letters.

""spild"" not a word.

""milp""? not word.

A word with L at 1: ""lip?"" too short. ""lumps"" -> L,U,M,P,S? But U? We haven't excluded U? 
""lumps"": L,U,M,P,S -> letters: L,U,M,P,S? We need I? We must have I? Because I is in the word, so without I? So ""lumps"" doesn't have I -> invalid.

Therefore, we must have I, so L at 1 and I? Then I must be at 3 or 4 or 5? But if we put L at 1, I at 3, we can't put L at 1? Why not? It's allowed? We have no feedback against L at 1.

But the word must contain P somewhere? 

Example: ""lip"" is too short.

""lipid"" was invalid because I must not be at 2.

Another word with L at 1: ""lysis"" no P.

""limps"": L,I,M,P,S -> 
   positions: 
     L at 1 -> okay? 
     I at 2 -> not okay? Because I cannot be at position2? 
        Therefore, putting I at position2 is explicitly against the feedback? So we cannot do that.

So if we have L at 1? Then where to put I? We can put I at 3,4,5? 

Example: ""lp"" not a word. It's hard to get a word with L at 1 and I not at 2? But then a word like ""livid"" but V and I? And D is available? ""livid"": L,I,V,I,D -> has two I's? 
But does it have P? No, P is required.

""pulps"" -> P,U,L,P,S -> duplicate P? And no I? So loses I.

Therefore, it's difficult to have L at position 1 without putting I at an improper position? Not exactly, but we must have I somewhere? 

Actually, if we put L at 1, we need I at 3,4, or5? And P at any except1? 

But P was forbidden from pos1, so we can put P at 2,3,4,5? 

For example: 
   Position 1: L
   Position 2: P -> allowed? Because P forbidden only from pos1? So yes.
   Position 3: I -> allowed? Because I forbidden only from pos2? Yes, so pos3 is okay.

But is there a word ""lpi"" not a word? 

Words? ""lapin"" excluded A and N.
""lapel"" excluded A and E? A excluded.

How about ""linux"" -> L,I,N,U,X -> N excluded? Invalid.

""lipid"" had I at2? That's forbidden.

But if we put I at position4? 

Example: ""lumpi"" not standard? 

So I think it's more efficient to go with either ""blips"" or ""flips"".

Since ""blips"" uses B and S, which are common, and ""flips"" uses F and S? Both S? Or ""blimp"" uses M...

But S is more common than M or F? So let's choose S.

Between ""blips"" and ""flips"": 
   ""blips"" uses B (less common) and ""flips"" uses F (also less common)? But S is common to both? Actually, ""blips"" uses B,L,I,P,S and ""flips"" uses F,L,I,P,S. Both have S? Yes.

But we don't have any information about S? So we might want to test it.

Therefore, either is fine.

I choose ""flips"": FLIPS (verb form of flip? Yes).Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From ""pilot"": 
  - P, I, L are in the word but in the wrong positions (P, I, L cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively).
  - O and T are not in the word.

The secret word must contain P, I, L and avoid the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, O, T). For the next guess:
- Must include P, I, L (in positions other than 1, 2, 3 as previously used).
- Letters must be chosen from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word should test new common letters to gather more positional information.

The word ""flips"" (F, L, I, P, S) is appropriate because:
- Contains the required P, I, L.
- Avoids excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, T.
- Positions reposition P, I, L: 
  - L at position 2 (not position 3, where it was incorrect before).
  - I at position 3 (not position 2, where it was incorrect before).
  - P at position 4 (not position 1, where it was incorrect before).
- Introduces new common letters: F and S (S is high-frequency).",Guess 3: flips -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) I(✓) P(-) S(-),FAIL

Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it is a popular starting word that covers common letters: C, R, A, N, E.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> all letters are marked with 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Since none of these letters are in the word, we must avoid using any of the letters C, R, A, N, E in our next guess.

 We need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.

 We should pick a word that uses common letters that haven't been tried yet. Common letters in English include S, T, O, I, L, D, H, U, M, P, etc.

 Let's consider words that use these letters.

 Some options: 
 - ""south"": uses S, O, U, T, H
 - ""pilot"": uses P, I, L, O, T
 - ""built"": uses B, U, I, L, T
 - ""dumpy"": uses D, U, M, P, Y

 However, we also want to maximize the coverage of new letters.

 Let me think of more words without C,R,A,N,E.

 Another popular starting word that avoids these letters is ""sight"": S, I, G, H, T.

 But we can choose a word that uses more common letters.

 Consider ""point"": P, O, I, N, T ... but note we cannot use 'N' because it was excluded? Wait, feedback said N(x) meaning N is not in the word, so we should avoid N? Actually, in the feedback: ""N(x)"" meaning not in the word, so indeed we must avoid N.

 But wait: the feedback for ""crane"" was C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) -> so exclude C, R, A, N, E.

 Therefore, ""point"" has N, so that's not allowed.

 How about ""pilot""? P, I, L, O, T -> none of these are in the excluded list (C,R,A,N,E).

 Yes, that could be a good candidate.

 Also ""split"": S, P, L, I, T -> again, no excluded letters.

 However, let's check the commonality of letters.

 Alternatively, ""might"": M, I, G, H, T -> no excluded letters.

 But note we are not limited to just one word. We want to cover as many common letters as possible.

 Common English letters (after removing C, R, A, N, E) might be: S, T, O, I, L, P, H, U, M, D, Y, W, F, G, etc.

 We can use a word that maximizes the usage of high frequency letters remaining.

 Since T and O are very common, perhaps ""toils"": T, O, I, L, S -> but wait, we are avoiding R, but R is excluded? Actually, R is excluded so that's okay.

 However, ""toils"" uses T, O, I, L, S -> all are allowed.

 But let me check if ""toils"" is a valid word? It is the plural of toil? In Wordle, plurals are sometimes allowed if they are common.

 Alternatively, ""spoil"": S, P, O, I, L -> same letters almost, but I thinks it's valid.

 Another option: ""lousy"": L, O, U, S, Y -> also uses U and Y.

 We need to pick one. Let's try a word that includes S, T, O, L, I? Actually, we have limited spots.

 After excluding C,R,A,N,E, the most common letters are: S, T, O, I, L, P, etc.

 I'll pick ""spoil"" because it uses S, P, O, I, L which are all common.

 But note: S and O appear in many words. We are only on the second guess, so maximizing coverage is good.

 Another candidate is ""poult"" (a young bird) but that might be obscure? Better to use common words.

 A more popular word: ""shift"" -> S, H, I, F, T. But H and F are less common? It's acceptable.

 Or ""stomp"": S, T, O, M, P -> good letters, but O? Yes.

 However, to avoid potential duplication, let's choose ""pilot"" or ""split""?

 I think ""pilot"" is a good choice: letters P,I,L,O,T.

 Let me confirm: P not excluded? Yes. I, L, O, T are all not excluded? Correct.

 So I'll go with ""pilot"".

 But wait, what if we use a word that doesn't repeat any letters? ""pilot"" has unique letters.

 Alternatively, ""mouls"" is not common. Let's stick with a common word.

 Actually, ""pilot"" is a standard word.

 Therefore, I will guess ""pilot"".Based on the feedback from the first guess (""crane""), none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, these letters must be avoided in the next guess. 

The new guess should include common letters not yet tested to maximize information. Suitable letters might include S, T, O, L, I, P, H, U, M, D, Y, etc. After evaluating options like ""spoil"" (S,P,O,I,L), ""split"" (S,P,L,I,T), ""pilot"" (P,I,L,O,T), and ""might"" (M,I,G,H,T), ""pilot"" is selected because:
- It uses 5 new, common letters: P, I, L, O, T
- It avoids excluded letters
- It is a valid English word with unique letters

<guess>pilot</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: pilot -> FEEDBACK: P(-) I(-) L(-) O(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. First guess ""crane"": all letters (C,R,A,N,E) are marked with 'x', meaning none of these letters are in the secret word.
2. Second guess ""pilot"": 
   - P is marked with '-', meaning P is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - I is marked with '-', meaning I is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - L is marked with '-', meaning L is in the word but in the wrong position.
   - O and T are marked with 'x', meaning they are not in the word.

From the feedback of ""pilot"":
- The secret word contains the letters P, I, and L, but NOT O or T.
- Also, note from the first guess, we know C,R,A,N,E are not in the word.

So, we have:
- Confirmed letters in the word: P, I, L.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, T.

We must use a word that contains P, I, and L, and avoids the excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,O,T.

Additionally, we know that all three letters P, I, L are in the secret word but in the wrong position as per the guess ""pilot"". 
- In ""pilot"", P was in position 1, I in position 2, L in position 3. But these positions are wrong for each of them.

Therefore, for the next guess:
- We need a 5-letter word that includes P, I, L (all must be present) and two other letters that are not excluded.
- The positions of P, I, L must not be the same as in ""pilot"" (i.e., P cannot be in position 1, I cannot be in position 2, L cannot be in position 3).

Excluded Letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, T.

Available Letters: We can use letters from the alphabet except these excluded ones. Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we need to form a word with P, I, L and two other letters from the available set.

We must choose a word where:
- P is not in position 1
- I is not in position 2
- L is not in position 3

We need to choose a word that rearranges P, I, L and includes two new letters.

Common letters to try: S, U, M, H, etc.

Possible words containing P, I, L:
- We need to position P, L, I in other indices.

Consider possible placements:

Example: 
- Position 1: cannot be P (because in ""pilot"" P was in pos1 and it was wrong). So pos1 must be a new letter.
- Similarly, pos2 cannot be I, and pos3 cannot be L.

So, the positions for P: must be in 2,3,4,5? But wait, in the word, P can be in any position except 1? Actually, the feedback says P is in the word but not in position 1. So P could be in 2,3,4,5. But note that if we put P in position 3, that might be okay because in ""pilot"" position 3 was L, not P.

Similarly for I: cannot be in position 2, so it can be in 1,3,4,5.
For L: cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1,2,4,5.

Now, we want to cover more letters. Let's think of words.

Some candidate words:
- ""spilt"": contains S,P,I,L,T -> but T is excluded? We have excluded T (from ""pilot"" T was marked 'x'). So ""spilt"" has T which is excluded -> invalid.

Alternative: ""split"": S,P,L,I,T -> again T excluded -> invalid.

We cannot use T. So let's avoid T.

What about ""blimp"": B,L,I,M,P -> letters: B, L, I, M, P. 
- Check excluded letters: none of these are in C,R,A,N,E,O,T -> okay.
- Positions: 
   - B in pos1, 
   - L in pos2 (but wait: L cannot be in position 3? But position 2 for L is okay? The constraint for L is that it cannot be in position 3 (from the feedback of ""pilot""). So position 2 is allowed? Yes, because the feedback only says that in position 3 it was wrong, but L is in the word and can be in another position.

Similarly, P was previously in position1 and was wrong, so now we put P in position5? Okay. 
I was previously in position2 and wrong, now in position3? That's a different position? But we don't know if position3 is correct? The feedback only says that in position2 it was wrong, but it can be in position3? Actually, it's allowed to be in position3 because the previous feedback was only about position2.

Wait, the feedback for I: it's in the word but not in position2. It can be in any other position. Same for L: not in position3, so it can be in others.

But note: the word ""blimp"": 
   pos1: B (new)
   pos2: L -> L is in position2: acceptable? Yes, since L was only forbidden from position3.
   pos3: I -> I is in position3: acceptable? Yes, because I was only forbidden from position2.
   pos4: M (new)
   pos5: P -> P is in position5: acceptable? Yes, because P was forbidden from position1.

So ""blimp"" is a candidate.

But is ""blimp"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a light airship.

Another candidate: ""guild"" but does not have P? We must have P.

We need P, I, L.

Another possibility: ""plink"" -> P,L,I,N,K -> but N is excluded (from first guess). Invalid.

""flips"": F,L,I,P,S -> letters: F, L, I, P, S. 
- Avoids excluded? Let's check: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,O,T. F,L,I,P,S are all allowed.
- Positions:
   ""flips"": 
        pos1: F -> new
        pos2: L -> L in pos2: allowed? Yes, since L cannot be in pos3 only? Actually, the feedback doesn't prevent L from being in pos2.
        pos3: I -> I in pos3: but I cannot be in pos2? That doesn't forbid pos3. So okay.
        pos4: P -> P in pos4: okay (not pos1)
        pos5: S -> new
But note: the feedback for ""pilot"" said P is in the word but not in pos1, I not in pos2, L not in pos3. This arrangement meets that.

So ""flips"" is also a candidate.

Another: ""slipp"" not a word.

""spill"": S,P,I,L,L -> but duplicate L? Not allowed? Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters, but here ""spill"" has two L's. But we must be cautious because we don't know if the word has duplicate L. However, in the feedback from ""pilot"", L was marked as '-' meaning at least one L is present. It doesn't tell us if there are more.

But ""spill"" is S,P,I,L,L. Now, S and L are the new letters? But we don't know if L may appear twice? We can't be sure. Also, ""spill"" has L in position 4 and 5? But position5: L. But we don't know if L can be in other positions? Actually, the feedback doesn't forbid multiple L.

But note: we know that L is in the word, but we don't know the count. So words with two L might be possible.

However, we have two L's in ""spill"". Let's check if it violates.

But in the feedback for ""pilot"": we had only one L and it was in position3 and wrong. So if the word has two L's, one might be in another position? We don't know.

But we are guessing, it's acceptable. However, let's see other words.

""milks"": M,I,L,K,S -> has K and S. But does it have P? No, we need P? Yes, P is required.

We must have P.

So we need a word that contains P, I, L. Both ""flips"" and ""blimp"" are candidates.

Another candidate: ""hipsy""? Not common. ""lipid""? L,I,P,I,D -> has two I's? And D. But we can check: L in pos1? Then I in pos2? But I cannot be in pos2? Because in ""pilot"", I was in pos2 and was wrong? So if we guess ""lipid"": 
   pos1: L (allowed? L forbidden only in pos3 -> okay)
   pos2: I -> forbidden! Because in the feedback, I cannot be in pos2. So we must not put I in pos2.

Thus, ""lipid"" is invalid because it puts I in pos2.

Similarly, any word putting I in pos2 is invalid.

In ""flips"": 
   pos1: F (new)
   pos2: L -> allowed? Since L is not forbidden from pos2, only from pos3 -> okay.
   pos3: I -> allowed? Because I was forbidden from pos2? Then pos3 is allowed? Yes.
   pos4: P -> allowed (not pos1)
   pos5: S (new)

So that seems fine. 

But wait, what about P: in ""pilot"" we put P in pos1 and wrong, so putting P in pos4 is okay? Yes.

Similarly, L: in ""pilot"" was in pos3 and wrong, so here in pos2 is okay? Yes.

I: in ""pilot"" was in pos2 and wrong, so in pos3 is okay? Yes.

So ""flips"" is valid.

Similarly, ""blimp"" was valid.

Now, which one to choose? Both are valid, so we can pick either. Let's choose the one that uses more common letters or covers letters we haven't tried.

In ""blimp"": uses B, L, I, M, P. The new letters are B and M. We haven't tried B, M.

In ""flips"": uses F, L, I, P, S. The new letters are F and S.

S is a very common letter, so perhaps ""flips"" might be better to cover S.

Also, note that we might need to consider the pattern.

Another possibility: ""slyly"" but no P,I,L.

So I think ""flips"" is a good choice because S is common and F is less common but we cover it.

But note: the feedback might reveal positions.

So I'll select ""flips"".

However, let me see if there are words that have P, I, L and use even more common letters? For example, with H or U.

""build"" no P. ""phial"" -> P,H,I,A,L -> but A is excluded? From first guess, A is excluded? Yes, we saw A(x). So we cannot use A. ""phial"" has A -> excluded -> invalid.

""quipf"" not a word.

So I think ""flips"" is acceptable.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on guess 3.

Another candidate: ""wimp"": too short. Not 5 letters.

""plink"" had N -> excluded.

""blips"": B,L,I,P,S -> same as ""blimp"" but with S instead of M? Actually, ""blips"" is a word? It is the plural of blip? Yes.

""blips"": 
   pos1: B
   pos2: L -> allowed? L forbidden in pos3, so pos2 okay.
   pos3: I -> but I is forbidden in position 2? Then what about pos3? That's allowed. But note: if we put I in pos3, that's allowed. And L in pos2 is allowed.
   pos4: P -> okay (not pos1)
   pos5: S

But we must avoid putting L in pos3? No, L is forbidden only from pos3? Exactly, so we cannot put L in pos3? Wait, the feedback says L is in the word but not in pos3. So when we guess, we must not put L in pos3 because we know it's not there. Therefore, if we use a word that has L in pos3, that would be incorrect? Actually, no: the feedback tells us that in the secret word, L is not in pos3. Therefore, we must avoid putting L in pos3 because we know that position is incorrect. So if we put L in pos3, it would be explicitly against the feedback? Yes.

So in ""blips"", L is in pos2? Then it's okay? Yes.

Actually, ""blips"" has:
   pos1: B
   pos2: L (okay, because not pos3)
   pos3: I (okay, because not pos2)
   pos4: P (okay, because not pos1)
   pos5: S

So ""blips"" is also valid.

Between ""flips"", ""blimp"", and ""blips"": 

- ""flips"": letters F, L, I, P, S
- ""blimp"": B, L, I, M, P
- ""blips"": B, L, I, P, S

We might want to cover S because it's common, so ""blips"" or ""flips"". 

But ""blips"" uses B,L,I,P,S: same as ""blips"", so S is common? Yes.

Alternatively, since we are going to cover S in one of them, we can choose.

Let me pick ""blips"" because it uses B and S, and we avoid F which might be less common? Actually, both are good.

But note: we also want to check the positions: 

In the secret word, we know that P, I, L must be in positions different from ""pilot"". However, we don't have information about their correct placements yet. So we want to rearrange them to potential places.

We have to try a configuration we haven't guessed.

Positions:
In ""pilot"": P at 1, I at 2, L at 3 -> all wrong.

Now, in our next guess, let's assume we assign the positions arbitrarily? We can. 

Since we don't know, we could consider assigning I to position 3, L to position 2, P to position 4? As in ""blips""? That mixes them around.

Similarly, ""flips"" does: P at 4, I at 3, L at 2.

Actually, same rearrangement: L at 2, I at 3, P at 4.

So both ""blips"" and ""flips"" have L at 2, I at 3, P at 4. ""blimp"" has L at 2, I at 3, P at 5 (because ""blimp"" is B L I M P).

We could try a different permutation? 

For example, put L at position 1? 
To minimize conflict? 

But we don't know. 

Consider ""lipid"" -> but we cannot have I at 2, so that was invalid.

""pils"": not 5 letters.

""spild"" not a word.

""milp""? not word.

A word with L at 1: ""lip?"" too short. ""lumps"" -> L,U,M,P,S? But U? We haven't excluded U? 
""lumps"": L,U,M,P,S -> letters: L,U,M,P,S? We need I? We must have I? Because I is in the word, so without I? So ""lumps"" doesn't have I -> invalid.

Therefore, we must have I, so L at 1 and I? Then I must be at 3 or 4 or 5? But if we put L at 1, I at 3, we can't put L at 1? Why not? It's allowed? We have no feedback against L at 1.

But the word must contain P somewhere? 

Example: ""lip"" is too short.

""lipid"" was invalid because I must not be at 2.

Another word with L at 1: ""lysis"" no P.

""limps"": L,I,M,P,S -> 
   positions: 
     L at 1 -> okay? 
     I at 2 -> not okay? Because I cannot be at position2? 
        Therefore, putting I at position2 is explicitly against the feedback? So we cannot do that.

So if we have L at 1? Then where to put I? We can put I at 3,4,5? 

Example: ""lp"" not a word. It's hard to get a word with L at 1 and I not at 2? But then a word like ""livid"" but V and I? And D is available? ""livid"": L,I,V,I,D -> has two I's? 
But does it have P? No, P is required.

""pulps"" -> P,U,L,P,S -> duplicate P? And no I? So loses I.

Therefore, it's difficult to have L at position 1 without putting I at an improper position? Not exactly, but we must have I somewhere? 

Actually, if we put L at 1, we need I at 3,4, or5? And P at any except1? 

But P was forbidden from pos1, so we can put P at 2,3,4,5? 

For example: 
   Position 1: L
   Position 2: P -> allowed? Because P forbidden only from pos1? So yes.
   Position 3: I -> allowed? Because I forbidden only from pos2? Yes, so pos3 is okay.

But is there a word ""lpi"" not a word? 

Words? ""lapin"" excluded A and N.
""lapel"" excluded A and E? A excluded.

How about ""linux"" -> L,I,N,U,X -> N excluded? Invalid.

""lipid"" had I at2? That's forbidden.

But if we put I at position4? 

Example: ""lumpi"" not standard? 

So I think it's more efficient to go with either ""blips"" or ""flips"".

Since ""blips"" uses B and S, which are common, and ""flips"" uses F and S? Both S? Or ""blimp"" uses M...

But S is more common than M or F? So let's choose S.

Between ""blips"" and ""flips"": 
   ""blips"" uses B (less common) and ""flips"" uses F (also less common)? But S is common to both? Actually, ""blips"" uses B,L,I,P,S and ""flips"" uses F,L,I,P,S. Both have S? Yes.

But we don't have any information about S? So we might want to test it.

Therefore, either is fine.

I choose ""flips"": FLIPS (verb form of flip? Yes).Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.
- From ""pilot"": 
  - P, I, L are in the word but in the wrong positions (P, I, L cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively).
  - O and T are not in the word.

The secret word must contain P, I, L and avoid the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, O, T). For the next guess:
- Must include P, I, L (in positions other than 1, 2, 3 as previously used).
- Letters must be chosen from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- The word should test new common letters to gather more positional information.

The word ""flips"" (F, L, I, P, S) is appropriate because:
- Contains the required P, I, L.
- Avoids excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, T.
- Positions reposition P, I, L: 
  - L at position 2 (not position 3, where it was incorrect before).
  - I at position 3 (not position 2, where it was incorrect before).
  - P at position 4 (not position 1, where it was incorrect before).
- Introduces new common letters: F and S (S is high-frequency).

Remaining letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we need to form a word with P, I, L and two other letters from the available set.\n\nWe must choose a word where:\n- P is not in position 1\n- I is not in position 2\n- L is not in position 3\n\nWe need to choose a word that rearranges P, I, L and includes two new letters.\n\nCommon letters to try: S, U, M, H, etc.\n\nPossible words containing P, I, L:\n- We need to position P, L, I in other indices.\n\nConsider possible placements:\n\nExample: \n- Position 1: cannot be P (because in ""pilot"" P was in pos1 and it was wrong). So pos1 must be a new letter.\n- Similarly, pos2 cannot be I, and pos3 cannot be L.\n\nSo, the positions for P: must be in 2,3,4,5? But wait, in the word, P can be in any position except 1? Actually, the feedback says P is in the word but not in position 1. So P could be in 2,3,4,5. But note that if we put P in position 3, that might be okay because in ""pilot"" position 3 was L, not P.\n\nSimilarly for I: cannot be in position 2, so it can be in 1,3,4,5.\nFor L: cannot be in position 3, so it can be in 1,2,4,5.\n\nNow, we want to cover more letters. Let\'s think of words.\n\nSome candidate words:\n- ""spilt"": contains S,P,I,L,T -> but T is excluded? We have excluded T (from ""pilot"" T was marked \'x\'). So ""spilt"" has T which is excluded -> invalid.\n\nAlternative: ""split"": S,P,L,I,T -> again T excluded -> invalid.\n\nWe cannot use T. So let\'s avoid T.\n\nWhat about ""blimp"": B,L,I,M,P -> letters: B, L, I, M, P. \n- Check excluded letters: none of these are in C,R,A,N,E,O,T -> okay.\n- Positions: \n   - B in pos1, \n   - L in pos2 (but wait: L cannot be in position 3? But position 2 for L is okay? The constraint for L is that it cannot be in position 3 (from the feedback of ""pilot""). So position 2 is allowed? Yes, because the feedback only says that in position 3 it was wrong, but L is in the word and can be in another position.\n\nSimilarly, P was previously in position1 and was wrong, so now we put P in position5? Okay. \nI was previously in position2 and wrong, now in position3? That\'s a different position? But we don\'t know if position3 is correct? The feedback only says that in position2 it was wrong, but it can be in position3? Actually, it\'s allowed to be in position3 because the previous feedback was only about position2.\n\nWait, the feedback for I: it\'s in the word but not in position2. It can be in any other position. Same for L: not in position3, so it can be in others.\n\nBut note: the word ""blimp"": \n   pos1: B (new)\n   pos2: L -> L is in position2: acceptable? Yes, since L was only forbidden from position3.\n   pos3: I -> I is in position3: acceptable? Yes, because I was only forbidden from position2.\n   pos4: M (new)\n   pos5: P -> P is in position5: acceptable? Yes, because P was forbidden from position1.\n\nSo ""blimp"" is a candidate.\n\nBut is ""blimp"" a valid word? Yes, meaning a light airship.\n\nAnother candidate: ""guild"" but does not have P? We must have P.\n\nWe need P, I, L.\n\nAnother possibility: ""plink"" -> P,L,I,N,K -> but N is excluded (from first guess). Invalid.\n\n""flips"": F,L,I,P,S -> letters: F, L, I, P, S. \n- Avoids excluded? Let\'s check: excluded are C,R,A,N,E,O,T. F,L,I,P,S are all allowed.\n- Positions:\n   ""flips"": \n        pos1: F -> new\n        pos2: L -> L in pos2: allowed? Yes, since L cannot be in pos3 only? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t prevent L from being in pos2.\n        pos3: I -> I in pos3: but I cannot be in pos2? That doesn\'t forbid pos3. So okay.\n        pos4: P -> P in pos4: okay (not pos1)\n        pos5: S -> new\nBut note: the feedback for ""pilot"" said P is in the word but not in pos1, I not in pos2, L not in pos3. This arrangement meets that.\n\nSo ""flips"" is also a candidate.\n\nAnother: ""slipp"" not a word.\n\n""spill"": S,P,I,L,L -> but duplicate L? Not allowed? Actually, the secret word might have duplicate letters, but here ""spill"" has two L\'s. But we must be cautious because we don\'t know if the word has duplicate L. However, in the feedback from ""pilot"", L was marked as \'-\' meaning at least one L is present. It doesn\'t tell us if there are more.\n\nBut ""spill"" is S,P,I,L,L. Now, S and L are the new letters? But we don\'t know if L may appear twice? We can\'t be sure. Also, ""spill"" has L in position 4 and 5? But position5: L. But we don\'t know if L can be in other positions? Actually, the feedback doesn\'t forbid multiple L.\n\nBut note: we know that L is in the word, but we don\'t know the count. So words with two L might be possible.\n\nHowever, we have two L\'s in ""spill"". Let\'s check if it violates.\n\nBut in the feedback for ""pilot"": we had only one L and it was in position3 and wrong. So if the word has two L\'s, one might be in another position? We don\'t know.\n\nBut we are guessing, it\'s acceptable. However, let\'s see other words.\n\n""milks"": M,I,L,K,S -> has K and S. But does it have P? No, we need P? Yes, P is required.\n\nWe must have P.\n\nSo we need a word that contains P, I, L. Both ""flips"" and ""blimp"" are candidates.\n\nAnother candidate: ""hipsy""? Not common. ""lipid""? L,I,P,I,D -> has two I\'s? And D. But we can check: L in pos1? Then I in pos2? But I cannot be in pos2? Because in ""pilot"", I was in pos2 and was wrong? So if we guess ""lipid"": \n   pos1: L (allowed? L forbidden only in pos3 -> okay)\n   pos2: I -> forbidden! Because in the feedback, I cannot be in pos2. So we must not put I in pos2.\n\nThus, ""lipid"" is invalid because it puts I in pos2.\n\nSimilarly, any word putting I in pos2 is invalid.\n\nIn ""flips"": \n   pos1: F (new)\n   pos2: L -> allowed? Since L is not forbidden from pos2, only from pos3 -> okay.\n   pos3: I -> allowed? Because I was forbidden from pos2? Then pos3 is allowed? Yes.\n   pos4: P -> allowed (not pos1)\n   pos5: S (new)\n\nSo that seems fine. \n\nBut wait, what about P: in ""pilot"" we put P in pos1 and wrong, so putting P in pos4 is okay? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, L: in ""pilot"" was in pos3 and wrong, so here in pos2 is okay? Yes.\n\nI: in ""pilot"" was in pos2 and wrong, so in pos3 is okay? Yes.\n\nSo ""flips"" is valid.\n\nSimilarly, ""blimp"" was valid.\n\nNow, which one to choose? Both are valid, so we can pick either. Let\'s choose the one that uses more common letters or covers letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nIn ""blimp"": uses B, L, I, M, P. The new letters are B and M. We haven\'t tried B, M.\n\nIn ""flips"": uses F, L, I, P, S. The new letters are F and S.\n\nS is a very common letter, so perhaps ""flips"" might be better to cover S.\n\nAlso, note that we might need to consider the pattern.\n\nAnother possibility: ""slyly"" but no P,I,L.\n\nSo I think ""flips"" is a good choice because S is common and F is less common but we cover it.\n\nBut note: the feedback might reveal positions.\n\nSo I\'ll select ""flips"".\n\nHowever, let me see if there are words that have P, I, L and use even more common letters? For example, with H or U.\n\n""build"" no P. ""phial"" -> P,H,I,A,L -> but A is excluded? From first guess, A is excluded? Yes, we saw A(x). So we cannot use A. ""phial"" has A -> excluded -> invalid.\n\n""quipf"" not a word.\n\nSo I think ""flips"" is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on guess 3.\n\nAnother candidate: ""wimp"": too short. Not 5 letters.\n\n""plink"" had N -> excluded.\n\n""blips"": B,L,I,P,S -> same as ""blimp"" but with S instead of M? Actually, ""blips"" is a word? It is the plural of blip? Yes.\n\n""blips"": \n   pos1: B\n   pos2: L -> allowed? L forbidden in pos3, so pos2 okay.\n   pos3: I -> but I is forbidden in position 2? Then what about pos3? That\'s allowed. But note: if we put I in pos3, that\'s allowed. And L in pos2 is allowed.\n   pos4: P -> okay (not pos1)\n   pos5: S\n\nBut we must avoid putting L in pos3? No, L is forbidden only from pos3? Exactly, so we cannot put L in pos3? Wait, the feedback says L is in the word but not in pos3. So when we guess, we must not put L in pos3 because we know it\'s not there. Therefore, if we use a word that has L in pos3, that would be incorrect? Actually, no: the feedback tells us that in the secret word, L is not in pos3. Therefore, we must avoid putting L in pos3 because we know that position is incorrect. So if we put L in pos3, it would be explicitly against the feedback? Yes.\n\nSo in ""blips"", L is in pos2? Then it\'s okay? Yes.\n\nActually, ""blips"" has:\n   pos1: B\n   pos2: L (okay, because not pos3)\n   pos3: I (okay, because not pos2)\n   pos4: P (okay, because not pos1)\n   pos5: S\n\nSo ""blips"" is also valid.\n\nBetween ""flips"", ""blimp"", and ""blips"": \n\n- ""flips"": letters F, L, I, P, S\n- ""blimp"": B, L, I, M, P\n- ""blips"": B, L, I, P, S\n\nWe might want to cover S because it\'s common, so ""blips"" or ""flips"". \n\nBut ""blips"" uses B,L,I,P,S: same as ""blips"", so S is common? Yes.\n\nAlternatively, since we are going to cover S in one of them, we can choose.\n\nLet me pick ""blips"" because it uses B and S, and we avoid F which might be less common? Actually, both are good.\n\nBut note: we also want to check the positions: \n\nIn the secret word, we know that P, I, L must be in positions different from ""pilot"". However, we don\'t have information about their correct placements yet. So we want to rearrange them to potential places.\n\nWe have to try a configuration we haven\'t guessed.\n\nPositions:\nIn ""pilot"": P at 1, I at 2, L at 3 -> all wrong.\n\nNow, in our next guess, let\'s assume we assign the positions arbitrarily? We can. \n\nSince we don\'t know, we could consider assigning I to position 3, L to position 2, P to position 4? As in ""blips""? That mixes them around.\n\nSimilarly, ""flips"" does: P at 4, I at 3, L at 2.\n\nActually, same rearrangement: L at 2, I at 3, P at 4.\n\nSo both ""blips"" and ""flips"" have L at 2, I at 3, P at 4. ""blimp"" has L at 2, I at 3, P at 5 (because ""blimp"" is B L I M P).\n\nWe could try a different permutation? \n\nFor example, put L at position 1? \nTo minimize conflict? \n\nBut we don\'t know. \n\nConsider ""lipid"" -> but we cannot have I at 2, so that was invalid.\n\n""pils"": not 5 letters.\n\n""spild"" not a word.\n\n""milp""? not word.\n\nA word with L at 1: ""lip?"" too short. ""lumps"" -> L,U,M,P,S? But U? We haven\'t excluded U? \n""lumps"": L,U,M,P,S -> letters: L,U,M,P,S? We need I? We must have I? Because I is in the word, so without I? So ""lumps"" doesn\'t have I -> invalid.\n\nTherefore, we must have I, so L at 1 and I? Then I must be at 3 or 4 or 5? But if we put L at 1, I at 3, we can\'t put L at 1? Why not? It\'s allowed? We have no feedback against L at 1.\n\nBut the word must contain P somewhere? \n\nExample: ""lip"" is too short.\n\n""lipid"" was invalid because I must not be at 2.\n\nAnother word with L at 1: ""lysis"" no P.\n\n""limps"": L,I,M,P,S -> \n   positions: \n     L at 1 -> okay? \n     I at 2 -> not okay? Because I cannot be at position2? \n        Therefore, putting I at position2 is explicitly against the feedback? So we cannot do that.\n\nSo if we have L at 1? Then where to put I? We can put I at 3,4,5? \n\nExample: ""lp"" not a word. It\'s hard to get a word with L at 1 and I not at 2? But then a word like ""livid"" but V and I? And D is available? ""livid"": L,I,V,I,D -> has two I\'s? \nBut does it have P? No, P is required.\n\n""pulps"" -> P,U,L,P,S -> duplicate P? And no I? So loses I.\n\nTherefore, it\'s difficult to have L at position 1 without putting I at an improper position? Not exactly, but we must have I somewhere? \n\nActually, if we put L at 1, we need I at 3,4, or5? And P at any except1? \n\nBut P was forbidden from pos1, so we can put P at 2,3,4,5? \n\nFor example: \n   Position 1: L\n   Position 2: P -> allowed? Because P forbidden only from pos1? So yes.\n   Position 3: I -> allowed? Because I forbidden only from pos2? Yes, so pos3 is okay.\n\nBut is there a word ""lpi"" not a word? \n\nWords? ""lapin"" excluded A and N.\n""lapel"" excluded A and E? A excluded.\n\nHow about ""linux"" -> L,I,N,U,X -> N excluded? Invalid.\n\n""lipid"" had I at2? That\'s forbidden.\n\nBut if we put I at position4? \n\nExample: ""lumpi"" not standard? \n\nSo I think it\'s more efficient to go with either ""blips"" or ""flips"".\n\nSince ""blips"" uses B and S, which are common, and ""flips"" uses F and S? Both S? Or ""blimp"" uses M...\n\nBut S is more common than M or F? So let\'s choose S.\n\nBetween ""blips"" and ""flips"": \n   ""blips"" uses B (less common) and ""flips"" uses F (also less common)? But S is common to both? Actually, ""blips"" uses B,L,I,P,S and ""flips"" uses F,L,I,P,S. Both have S? Yes.\n\nBut we don\'t have any information about S? So we might want to test it.\n\nTherefore, either is fine.\n\nI choose ""flips"": FLIPS (verb form of flip? Yes).Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n- From ""crane"": C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.\n- From ""pilot"": \n  - P, I, L are in the word but in the wrong positions (P, I, L cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3 respectively).\n  - O and T are not in the word.\n\nThe secret word must contain P, I, L and avoid the excluded letters (C, R, A, N, E, O, T). For the next guess:\n- Must include P, I, L (in positions other than 1, 2, 3 as previously used).\n- Letters must be chosen from B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n- The word should test new common letters to gather more positional information.\n\nThe word ""flips"" (F, L, I, P, S) is appropriate because:\n- Contains the required P, I, L.\n- Avoids excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, O, T.\n- Positions reposition P, I, L: \n  - L at position 2 (not position 3, where it was incorrect before).\n  - I at position 3 (not position 2, where it was incorrect before).\n  - P at position 4 (not position 1, where it was incorrect before).\n- Introduces new common letters: F and S (S is high-frequency).\n\n<guess>flips</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: pilot -> FEEDBACK: P(-) I(-) L(-) O(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: flips -> FEEDBACK: F(x) L(-) I(✓) P(-) S(-)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) → Excluded: C, R, A, N, E
2. **pilot**: P(-) I(-) L(-) O(x) T(x) → 
   - P is in the word but not position ①
   - I is in the word but not position ②
   - L is in the word but not position ③
   - O and T are excluded → Add O, T to exclusions
3. **flips**: F(x) L(-) I(✓) P(-) S(-) →
   - F is not in the word → Exclude F
   - L is in the word but not position ②? Wait, position details:
        flips: positions 
        1: F (x)
        2: L (-) → L is in word, but not position 2
        3: I (✓) → I is in word and correct position (so secret word has I at position 3)
        4: P (-) → P is in word, but not position 4
        5: S (-) → S is in word, but not position 5

Therefore, we know:
- **Position 3 must be I** (from ✓ in ""flips"").
- **Letters in the word**: P, I (already known), L, S (from S(-)), and the I is fixed at pos3.
- P is in the word but not in position 1 (from pilot) and not in position 4 (from flips).
- L is in the word but:
  - Not position ③ (from pilot: L was in pos3 and was wrong) 
  - Not position ② (from flips: L was in pos2 and was wrong again → because got ⇦)
- S is in the word but not position 5 (from flips).

So current constraints:
- Secret word has the letters: P, I, L, S and one unknown letter (since 5 letters).
- Fixed position: position ③ = I.
- Known incorrect positions:
  - P cannot be in positions ① (pilot) or ④ (flips).
  - L cannot be in positions ② (flips), ③ (pilot).
  - S cannot be in position ⑤ (flips).

Also, exclusions: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, F.

Remaining available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and note we also have S, L, P, but we know they are already in).

Since we need to fill 5 letters, with known: I at 3, P, L, S must be somewhere.

The secret word has exactly 5 letters: [?, ?, I, ?, ?] 
- The ? are to be filled with P, L, S, and one more letter from the available set.

We need to form a word that has:
- I in position ③.
- Contains P, L, S, and one additional letter not excluded.

Additionally:
- P not in pos① or pos④ → So P can be only in pos② or pos⑤? Because positions are: 1,2,3,4,5 and 3 is taken by I, so P can be in 2 or 5.
- L not in pos② or ③ → So L can be in pos①,④,⑤. But note: if P is in ②, then L cannot be in ②? So L can be in 1,4,5? Actually:

Possible slots for P: 2 or 5.
Possible slots for L: 1,4,5 (but we must avoid putting L in any position we have feedback against).
S not in pos⑤ → so S can be in pos①,②,④.

Now, we also have the fifth letter (let's call it X) which must be one of B, D, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Option A: P is in position ②.
Then positions available: 
  1: ? (must be L, S, or X? But L cannot be in 1? Wait: L can be in 1,4,5)
  4: ?
  5: ?

But S can be in 1,2,4? Wait: S can be anywhere except 5? But we have position 2 free? No: position 2 would be P.

If P at ②, then:
  Position 1: either L, S, or X? But L allowed in 1? Yes.
  Position 4: ?
  Position 5: ?

But S cannot be at ⑤ → so S must be in 1 or 4? Or 4? Because 2 is taken by P.

Same way.

Alternatively: P at ⑤.

Let's list:

Case 1: P at ② (position 2).
Then:
  Pos1: either L, S, or new X? But we have L and S and one new.
  Pos4: remaining?
  Pos5: remaining?

But constraints: 
  L can be in 1,4,5 (but pos5 is free?).
  S can be in 1,4 (because not 5 and not taken).
Also, we must put L and S somewhere.

If P at ②:
  Then:
      P at ② → allowed? But note: in this guess we haven't tested P at ② before? Not explicitly forbidden? Only P not at1 and not at4.

But in ""pilot"", P was at1: wrong. In ""flips"", P was at4: wrong. But at2: we don't know? So we can try.

Then:
  Position ①: possibilities: L, S, or new letter? 
  Position ⑤: possibilities?

But note: S cannot be at5 → so S cannot be in pos5. Therefore:

  If P at2 and I at3:
    Position 1: either L or X (if X is new) or S?
      But if we put S in pos1? That's okay? Yes, S can be in1.
    Position 4: either S or L or X (if not used) → but S can be there.
    Position 5: must be X? Because P at2, I at3, so we need L and S and X? Wait: we have three letters to place? Yes: L, S, and one new letter? 

Actually, the secret word has exactly five letters: [L, P, I, S, and one other]. So when we fix P at2 and I at3, the remaining three positions must be L, S, and a new letter? But we only have one new letter? 

But each slot must be filled. Therefore: the fifth letter is one unknown.

So for positions:
  1: 
  4: 
  5: 
will be L, S, and X? 

But we cannot put S at position 5 → therefore, position 5 cannot be S? So:

Alternative positions:
  If P at2:
      Pos1: can be L? Then S must be at pos4? Because S cannot at5? Then pos5 must be the new letter X? 

Or:
      Pos1: can be S? Then L must be at 4 or 5? But L can be at4 or5? So if L at4, then pos5: X? If L at5, then S at4? 
        But if L at5? That's okay? Because L not forbidden from5? Only from2 and3? 
        Then S would be at pos4? 

Also, another possibility: pos1 = X? Then we must put L and S in pos4 and pos5? But S cannot at5? So S must be at4 and L at5? 

Therefore, possible when P at2:
   Option A:
      pos1: L, then pos4: S, pos5: X   → but L in1: okay? 
        Then word: L, P, I, S, X
   Option B:
      pos1: S, then pos4: L, pos5: X   → no: then S at1? Okay, L at4? Okay? 
        Word: S, P, I, L, X?
   Option C:
      pos1: S, then pos4: X, pos5: L   → then L at5? And S at1? Okay? 
        Word: S, P, I, X, L?
        But note: S is allowed in1? And L allowed in5?
   Or:
   Option D:
      pos1: X, then pos4: S, pos5: L   → so X at1, S at4, L at5? 
        Word: X, P, I, S, L
   Also:
   Option E:
      pos1: X, then pos4: L, pos5: S → but S at5 forbidden? So invalid.

So only four possibilities? 
But we don't know X.

Case 2: P at position ⑤.
Then:
  Position 5: P → okay? Because P not forbidden at5? And S not forbidden? S cannot be at5 → but this position is P? So S is elsewhere? Okay? 
  Now, positions left: 1,2,4.
      Also fixed: I at3.
  So positions:
      1: ?
      2: ?
      4: ?

  We have L and S and X to place? 
  Constraints:
      L cannot be at2? And cannot at3? But 3 is fixed? So L not at2? So L can be at1 or4? 
      S cannot at5? But5 is taken? So S can be at1,2,4? 
      Position 2: cannot put L? And cannot put what? 

  So:
      Position 1: can be L? Then S at1 or not? Then:
          If L at1? Then position 2: must be S or X? But S can be at2? Yes? Then position4: the other? 
          Or X at2? 
          So possibilities:
            Option F: L at1, S at2, X at4   → but L at1? Okay? S at2? This is allowed? 
            Option G: L at1, X at2, S at4?
            But note: S at2? That's allowed? Because S never appeared at2 and got feedback? We only had S at5 which was wrong.

      Position 1: S? Then L at4? Then position2: X?
        Option H: S at1, X at2, L at4

      Or position1: S, position2: X, position4: L? 
        Option I: S at1, X at2, L at4 → same as H

      Or if position1: X, then:
          position2: S or X? Wait: X is one letter? So we don't have two X? Only one.
          So position2: must be S? Then L at4? 
             Option J: X at1, S at2, L at4?
          Or position2: L? But L cannot be at2 → forbidden? 
          Or position2: S? Then L at4? 
          Alternatively: position2: S? Then L at4? 
          But if position1: X, position2: S, position4: L → Option J: X,S,then I at3, then L and P at5? 
          Word: X, S, I, L, P? 

But we also have pos5=P? So:

In summary for P at5:

    Word: [1, 2, I, 4, P] 
        Option F: L at1, S at2, X at4 → word: L, S, I, X, P?
        Option G: L at1, X at2, S at4 → word: L, X, I, S, P?
        Option H: S at1, X at2, L at4 → word: S, X, I, L, P?
        Option I: same as H? 
        And Option J: X at1, S at2, L at4 → word: X, S, I, L, P?

L and S placements? Okay? 

But note: in Option F: L at1? Okay? S at2? Also new.

Now, given that we have two alternatives: P at2 or P at5? 

We need to pick one? Or find a word that uses available letters.

Also, note: the new letter X must come from available: B,D,G,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, let's think of actual words for each pattern.

First, P at2 pattern:

Option A: word pattern: [L, P, I, S, X] → example: ""LPISX"" → no, not a word.

What about real words? Pattern: L P I S ? 
But the only real words ending with ""IS"" + something? Not common? Or ""IP"" we already have ""IP"" at2-3? 

Consider: ""lapis""? But ""lapis"" has A? Excluded? Invalid.

""klips"" with K? But we haven't tried K. Pattern: with L at1? Then ""KLIPS?"" → not a word? 

""slips"" -> S L I P S? Duplicate S? And without X? But that doesn't use a new letter? We don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? But the secret word must be exactly 5 distinct? Not necessarily? 

But note: we have 5 specific letters? No: wait, we don't! The secret word has P, I, L, S, and one other! So if we don't use a new letter? But we don't know if there are duplicates? 

But from feedback? We had ""flips"" gave S(-) meaning S is present at least once? Doesn't say how many. Similarly for L? But our constraint is that we have at least P, I, L, S? So if we use a word that has, say, two S? It would require? But we don't know.

But for Option A: ""l p i s x"" → no words.

Option B: pattern S P I L ? → ""spilX"" → what words? ""spile"" excluded E? ""spill""? But ""spill"" has two L? Then the fifth letter? Not needed? Wait: ""spill"" (S,P,I,L,L) → does it work? 
    But we know L is in the word? Having two L might be possible? 
    Positions: pos1=S, pos2=P, pos3=I (fixed), pos4=L, pos5=L? But S is at1? L at4 and L at5? 
    Check constraints:
        P at2: okay? But P cannot be at1? But at2 we argued? So allowed? But we have feedback: P cannot be at1 and at4? P at2: not tested? So okay? 
        L: 
            in this pattern: L at4? Forbidden? Because L cannot be at4? Wait: no, we have that L cannot be at2 and at3? 
            But L at4 is fine? 
            Also L at5? That's new? Okay? 
        I? At3: fixed? 
        S? At1: okay? 

    But in the feedback? We haven't been told anything about L at4? So it might be correct? 

    However, ""spill"" is a word, but note: it has duplicate L? And missing a letter? Actually, the secret word is S,P,I,L,L → so the letters are: S,P,I,L → but we have five letters? Wait: it's S,P,I,L,L → so the distinct letters are S,P,I,L → but we know the secret word must have L? And we also have S? But that covers.

But wait: we received feedback that S is present? And L is present? In ""spill"", it's indeed present with duplicates? So possible.

But in Option B pattern? We were going to use a word that ends with L? Or X? 

Without duplicates: ""spild"" not a word.

So ""spill"" fits? But we have not excluded duplicates? 

But let's note: we are using a word that doesn't introduce a new letter? So we might not gain new information? 

Alternatively, back to Case 2: P at5?

Consider P at5 pattern:

Option F: pattern L S I X P? → for example, ""lsixp"" → not a word.

But ""slip?"" we need 5 letters? 

Option G: pattern L X I S P? → ""lisp"" → 4 letters? 

""gawds"" no I? 

Option H: pattern S X I L P? → ""sxilp"" not word. 

What about ""skill""? But K? And double L? And pattern: S,K,I,L? But that's only 4 distinct letters? And P missing? 

We need P? Because P must be in the word? 

Patterns must have P at5? So words ending with P?

For example:
  Option J: pattern X S I L P? → words?:
      B S I L P? → not word.
      G S I L P? → ""gsilp"" not word.
      H S I L P? → ""hsilp"" not word.
      K S I L P? → ""ksilp"" not word.
      M S I L P? → ""msilp"" not word.
      U S I L P? → ""usilp"" not word.

Maybe ""mis"" not? 

Another word: ""was"" not? 

Wait, perhaps ""basil""? But ends at L? L not P? 

Actually? Common words ending with P that have L and S? 

For example, ""crisp"" excluded? 

""grasp"" excluded? 

Or ""clasp"": C excluded? 

""wisp"": but W,I,S,P? And then? But pattern: W at1? S at2? I at3? Then L? There is no L? 

""wisp"" has W,I,S,P -> no L? 

But we need L? 

""lisp""? L,I,S,P -> too short? 

Expand to 5 letters? ""lisps"" -> L,I,S,P,S duplicate S? Word: ""lisps"" → likely not? But it's a word (verb form of lisp?).

""lisps"": L at1, I at2? But in our pattern for Option J: we have to have position 1=X, position 2=S? So ""X S I L P""? 

Therefore, for ""lisps"" → it's L at1, I S P S? Positions: 
  1:L, 2:I, 3:S, 4:P, 5:S? But we need position3=I? So only if position3 is I? But in ""lisps"" position3 is S? 

So mismatch? 

And we have fixed position3=I? 

So only if we put I at3? 

But ""lisps"" would be: 
 position1:L, position2: not I? 

So not working? 

Another word: ""blips""? But we tried? But wait: we haven't, but in our option?

With P at5? 

Or perhaps ""drips""? D,R excluded? 

So hard? 

Let's go back to the previous guess feedback.

We also have ""flips"" feedback: S is in the word but not at position5? And in our pattern it's fine? 

But perhaps we are missing something.

The fifth letter? How about we guess a word that have another common consonant? 

Based on which letter is common? H,K,M, etc.

Given the constraints, a potential word is ""spill"" as we thought? 

But in ""spill"": 
   positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=I, 4=L, 5=L? That's 5-letter? 
   S at1? okay? 
   P at2? but P was not allowed at1 or at4? At2: okay? 
   I at3? perfect.
   L at4? okay? 
   L at5? duplicate? 

But is a duplicate allowed? We are not sure? But Wordle may have duplicates? It is possible.

However, let's see the feedback: in ""pilot"": we had one L? We have L given as ⇦ in position3? Then in ""flips"": we had L at2 and ⇦? So if the secret word has two L's? Then one appears in a correct position? 

But in ""spill"", we have L at4 and L at5? Then if we guess ""spill"", we might get:

   S at1: unknown?
   P at2: unknown?
   I at3: ✓
   L at4: ? 
   L at5: ?

But we also know L is present? 

However, we don't know if L can be at4? No information.

Also, if there is a duplicate L? 

But it is possible? 

Alternatively, we can try ""slyph""? Not a real word.

""python"" excluded? 

Maybe we need to try a different approach.

Let's list all possible words with I at3? And containing P, L, S? and length 5? 

For example:
- ""spill"" - as above
- ""split""? But T excluded? 
- ""splint""? N and T excluded? 
- ""apply""? A excluded? 
- ""slipe""? E excluded? 
- ""blimp""? but we haven't tried? ""blimp"" has P and I and L, but not S? And no I at3? 

And in ""blimp"": positions not fixed for I at3? 

Or if we put the word ""bless""? not contain P? 

Hard? 

Another possibility: ""polyp"" not? 

Wait, perhaps ""slip"" + another letter? 

Or ""lispy"": L,I,S,P,Y? That might be a word? 

""lispy"": 
   positions: 1=L, 2=I, 3=S, 4=P, 5=Y? 
   But we need position3 to be I? Currently is S? 

So not.

""yappy"" not?

But if we have pattern with S at1: ""s"" and then at4: L? Or something?

Example: ""solid"" no I fixed? 

But we need pattern: ? ? I in3, then at4=P? But P cannot be at4? 

Or at2: P? So ""spild"" not.

With existing available letters, possible words might be:

""build"" no P? 

After researching: ""slips"" is a word? Or ""pliss"" not.

In desperation? ""spils"" is not common.

But let's consider the feedback on L:

We know L is in the word but not at position2 or position3? And position3 is fixed as I? So L must be at1,4, or5? 

And S is in the word, not at5? So S at1,2, or4? 

P at2 or5? 

And one new letter? 

Now, how about the word ""whips"": W,H,I,P,S? 
   positions: 1=W, 2=H, 3=I? But position3=I in the guess? But then at4=P? P cannot be at4! So invalid.

How about ""gassy"" not P.

It's tricky? 

Maybe we try to put P at5? And find a word.

For example: ""dilly"" no P.

Or ""bulky"" no P.

Or ""gulps"": G,U,L,P,S? But 
  positions: 1=G, 2=U, 3=L? But position3 must be I! So cannot.

For the secret word to have I at3, guess must have I at3.

So we must have a 5-letter with I at3, containing P, L, S, and one other? And avoid excluded letters? 

Let's get specific:

A common word: ""bliss""? B,L,I,S,S? -> no P? 

""flail"" has I at3? F,L,A,I,L -> A excluded and no P? 

""to"" not? 

Perhaps not a common word? 

Or ""quilt"" excluded T? 

Another: ""child"" no P? 

Since the letter in question we can choose? How about with H? 

""while"" E excluded? 

 or ""shill"": S,H,I,L,L? This has our letters? S (at1), H, I (at3? if positions: s h i l l), then position3=I? Yes? And L later? 
   Does it have P? No.

""shill"" has no P? 

 with P: ""plash"" A excluded? 

Or  ""shelf"" F excluded? But what about the new feedback? 

We exclude F? From ""flips"": F(x)? 

So F is excluded? 

Let me list: potential words? ""skimp"" has S,K,I,M,P? 
   positions: we can arrange as ? , ? , I, ?, P? Because P at5? 
   But where to put S and K and M? 

If P at5? And I at3? Then:
   positions: 1,2,3,4,5 = ?, ?, I, ?, P

We have letter: S, K, M for positions 1,2,4? 
   S can be at1,2,4? 
   Constraints: 
        If we put S at1? Then 2 must be K or M? And 4=M or K? 

But no specific constraint for K or M? 

So ""skimp"" can be:
   Option: S K I M P? 
      positions: 1=S, 2=K, 3=I, 4=M, 5=P? 
   Check constraints:
        P at5? Allowed? Because only not at1 and not at4? 
        L? We must have L? But we forgot! 

""skimp"" doesn't have L? 

So it misses L? 

Similarly, ""prism"" has R? Excluded? 

"" "" 

W e need L? 

The only word I can think of is ""spill"" with duplicate L? 

Or ""lisps"" with duplicate S and no L? 

Or ""slipp"" not a word. 

Thus, we might need to try ""spill"".

Other options? ""psyll""? Not.

""pupil"": has U,P,I,L? But 
   positions: P,U,P,I,L (or if pupil -> P,U,P,I,L) 
   issues: P at1? Not allowed? Because excluded position for P? In ""pilot"", we put P1 and got wrong? So if we put P at1 in this guess? It would also be wrong? But why put it? 
   But to avoid: we have to have P at safe position? 
   But in this word: we have P at1 and at3? At1 is forbidden? So we put it only at position3? But position3 must be I? 

""pupil"" has P at1 and P at3? But position3 is P? But we have I at3 fixed? 

So not.

Therefore, we must guess ""spill"": S P I L L? 

Let's define the guess: ""spill"" 

Then in terms of feedback? We will get? 
   Position1: S -> if S is in another position? We only know not at5? So might be correct or not? 
   Position2: P -> we know P is in the word, and this is a new position? Previously wrong at1 and4? So now at2? Can be wrong? 
   Position3: I -> ✓ 
   Position4: L -> L's status? We know L not at2 or3? At4? If it's correct? Or if it's in another position? 
   Position5: L -> duplicate? Might be extra? 

But in the secret word, it may not have duplicate L? 

But let's try it? 

Alternatively, we can choose ""blips"" again? But we already know from ""flips"" that I is at3? And ""blips"" does not position I at3? 

If we guess ""blips"" it has I at2? But I forbidden at2? And also at position2. 

So it would be invalid to guess again? 

No: we can guess? But the feedback fromflips tellsusthat I is at3? So we know secret word has I at3? 

So it's better to use that.

Thus, ""spill"" seems like the best bet.

But to be safe, another word: ""shpiel"" too long.

Perhaps ""simper"" long.

I think for now, we guess ""spill"".

But ""spill"" has duplicate L? And we don't know? 

Maybe there's a word with L and S and P and I at3? And a new letter? 

I recall: ""aspic"" excluded letters? 

Or ""crimp"" excluded.

After thinking, one word: ""gipsy"": G,I,P,S,Y? But we need I at3? ""g i p s y"" positions: if I at1? Not at3? 

We can construct: let's try a guess with new letter? 

For example, if we put P at5:
   Pattern: X, S, I, L, P? 

For X choose H: ""H S I L P?"" -> ""hsilp"" not word.

Choose K: ""ksilp"" -> not.

How about ""mis"" (not).

Another idea: what is the word ""fifth""? No.

Perhaps the available letters include U? 

"" U S I L P"" -> ""usilp"" not word.

""quiz"" not.

I think we have to go with ""spill"".

So we'll guess ""spill"".

But note: in ""spill"", L is at4 and L at5? We don't know at4. 

But for the sake of the game, we try it.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses and analysis:

- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, F (confirmed not in the word).
- **Confirmed letter positions**: 
  - I is in position ③ (fixed and correct).
- **Confirmed present letters but in wrong positions**: 
  - P (cannot be in positions ① or ④).
  - L (cannot be in positions ② or ③).
  - S (cannot be in position ⑤).
- **Secret word composition**: Must contain P, I, L, S, and one unknown letter from the available set (B, D, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

After evaluating possible words that satisfy the constraints:
- P must be in position ② or ⑤.
- L must be in position ①, ④, or ⑤.
- S must be in position ①, ②, or ④.
- The fifth letter is unknown.

One valid word that fits most constraints and tests new letters is **""spill""**:
- Positions:
  - S at ① (S cannot be at ⑤, so position ① is allowable and untested).
  - P at ② (P cannot be at ① or ④, so position ② is allowable and untested).
  - I at ③ (fixed and correct).
  - L at ④ (L cannot be at ② or ③, so position ④ is allowable).
  - L at ⑤ (possible duplicate, acceptable since duplicate letters are allowed in Wordle).
- Benefits: Tests repositioning of P and L, introduces potential new information, and is a common English word.

This guess addresses the constraints:
- P is only at allowable positions (②).
- L is at an allowable position (④).
- S cannot be at ⑤, and is tested at ①.

If ""spill"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal:
- If S is correctly placed at position ①.
- If P is correctly placed at position ②.
- If L is correctly placed at position ④ or if there are duplicate Ls.
- New clues about letter positions/the unknown fifth letter.

<guess>spill</guess>",spill,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x) → Excluded: C, R, A, N, E
2. **pilot**: P(-) I(-) L(-) O(x) T(x) → 
   - P is in the word but not position ①
   - I is in the word but not position ②
   - L is in the word but not position ③
   - O and T are excluded → Add O, T to exclusions
3. **flips**: F(x) L(-) I(✓) P(-) S(-) →
   - F is not in the word → Exclude F
   - L is in the word but not position ②? Wait, position details:
        flips: positions 
        1: F (x)
        2: L (-) → L is in word, but not position 2
        3: I (✓) → I is in word and correct position (so secret word has I at position 3)
        4: P (-) → P is in word, but not position 4
        5: S (-) → S is in word, but not position 5

Therefore, we know:
- **Position 3 must be I** (from ✓ in ""flips"").
- **Letters in the word**: P, I (already known), L, S (from S(-)), and the I is fixed at pos3.
- P is in the word but not in position 1 (from pilot) and not in position 4 (from flips).
- L is in the word but:
  - Not position ③ (from pilot: L was in pos3 and was wrong) 
  - Not position ② (from flips: L was in pos2 and was wrong again → because got ⇦)
- S is in the word but not position 5 (from flips).

So current constraints:
- Secret word has the letters: P, I, L, S and one unknown letter (since 5 letters).
- Fixed position: position ③ = I.
- Known incorrect positions:
  - P cannot be in positions ① (pilot) or ④ (flips).
  - L cannot be in positions ② (flips), ③ (pilot).
  - S cannot be in position ⑤ (flips).

Also, exclusions: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, F.

Remaining available letters: B, D, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z (and note we also have S, L, P, but we know they are already in).

Since we need to fill 5 letters, with known: I at 3, P, L, S must be somewhere.

The secret word has exactly 5 letters: [?, ?, I, ?, ?] 
- The ? are to be filled with P, L, S, and one more letter from the available set.

We need to form a word that has:
- I in position ③.
- Contains P, L, S, and one additional letter not excluded.

Additionally:
- P not in pos① or pos④ → So P can be only in pos② or pos⑤? Because positions are: 1,2,3,4,5 and 3 is taken by I, so P can be in 2 or 5.
- L not in pos② or ③ → So L can be in pos①,④,⑤. But note: if P is in ②, then L cannot be in ②? So L can be in 1,4,5? Actually:

Possible slots for P: 2 or 5.
Possible slots for L: 1,4,5 (but we must avoid putting L in any position we have feedback against).
S not in pos⑤ → so S can be in pos①,②,④.

Now, we also have the fifth letter (let's call it X) which must be one of B, D, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's consider the possibilities:

Option A: P is in position ②.
Then positions available: 
  1: ? (must be L, S, or X? But L cannot be in 1? Wait: L can be in 1,4,5)
  4: ?
  5: ?

But S can be in 1,2,4? Wait: S can be anywhere except 5? But we have position 2 free? No: position 2 would be P.

If P at ②, then:
  Position 1: either L, S, or X? But L allowed in 1? Yes.
  Position 4: ?
  Position 5: ?

But S cannot be at ⑤ → so S must be in 1 or 4? Or 4? Because 2 is taken by P.

Same way.

Alternatively: P at ⑤.

Let's list:

Case 1: P at ② (position 2).
Then:
  Pos1: either L, S, or new X? But we have L and S and one new.
  Pos4: remaining?
  Pos5: remaining?

But constraints: 
  L can be in 1,4,5 (but pos5 is free?).
  S can be in 1,4 (because not 5 and not taken).
Also, we must put L and S somewhere.

If P at ②:
  Then:
      P at ② → allowed? But note: in this guess we haven't tested P at ② before? Not explicitly forbidden? Only P not at1 and not at4.

But in ""pilot"", P was at1: wrong. In ""flips"", P was at4: wrong. But at2: we don't know? So we can try.

Then:
  Position ①: possibilities: L, S, or new letter? 
  Position ⑤: possibilities?

But note: S cannot be at5 → so S cannot be in pos5. Therefore:

  If P at2 and I at3:
    Position 1: either L or X (if X is new) or S?
      But if we put S in pos1? That's okay? Yes, S can be in1.
    Position 4: either S or L or X (if not used) → but S can be there.
    Position 5: must be X? Because P at2, I at3, so we need L and S and X? Wait: we have three letters to place? Yes: L, S, and one new letter? 

Actually, the secret word has exactly five letters: [L, P, I, S, and one other]. So when we fix P at2 and I at3, the remaining three positions must be L, S, and a new letter? But we only have one new letter? 

But each slot must be filled. Therefore: the fifth letter is one unknown.

So for positions:
  1: 
  4: 
  5: 
will be L, S, and X? 

But we cannot put S at position 5 → therefore, position 5 cannot be S? So:

Alternative positions:
  If P at2:
      Pos1: can be L? Then S must be at pos4? Because S cannot at5? Then pos5 must be the new letter X? 

Or:
      Pos1: can be S? Then L must be at 4 or 5? But L can be at4 or5? So if L at4, then pos5: X? If L at5, then S at4? 
        But if L at5? That's okay? Because L not forbidden from5? Only from2 and3? 
        Then S would be at pos4? 

Also, another possibility: pos1 = X? Then we must put L and S in pos4 and pos5? But S cannot at5? So S must be at4 and L at5? 

Therefore, possible when P at2:
   Option A:
      pos1: L, then pos4: S, pos5: X   → but L in1: okay? 
        Then word: L, P, I, S, X
   Option B:
      pos1: S, then pos4: L, pos5: X   → no: then S at1? Okay, L at4? Okay? 
        Word: S, P, I, L, X?
   Option C:
      pos1: S, then pos4: X, pos5: L   → then L at5? And S at1? Okay? 
        Word: S, P, I, X, L?
        But note: S is allowed in1? And L allowed in5?
   Or:
   Option D:
      pos1: X, then pos4: S, pos5: L   → so X at1, S at4, L at5? 
        Word: X, P, I, S, L
   Also:
   Option E:
      pos1: X, then pos4: L, pos5: S → but S at5 forbidden? So invalid.

So only four possibilities? 
But we don't know X.

Case 2: P at position ⑤.
Then:
  Position 5: P → okay? Because P not forbidden at5? And S not forbidden? S cannot be at5 → but this position is P? So S is elsewhere? Okay? 
  Now, positions left: 1,2,4.
      Also fixed: I at3.
  So positions:
      1: ?
      2: ?
      4: ?

  We have L and S and X to place? 
  Constraints:
      L cannot be at2? And cannot at3? But 3 is fixed? So L not at2? So L can be at1 or4? 
      S cannot at5? But5 is taken? So S can be at1,2,4? 
      Position 2: cannot put L? And cannot put what? 

  So:
      Position 1: can be L? Then S at1 or not? Then:
          If L at1? Then position 2: must be S or X? But S can be at2? Yes? Then position4: the other? 
          Or X at2? 
          So possibilities:
            Option F: L at1, S at2, X at4   → but L at1? Okay? S at2? This is allowed? 
            Option G: L at1, X at2, S at4?
            But note: S at2? That's allowed? Because S never appeared at2 and got feedback? We only had S at5 which was wrong.

      Position 1: S? Then L at4? Then position2: X?
        Option H: S at1, X at2, L at4

      Or position1: S, position2: X, position4: L? 
        Option I: S at1, X at2, L at4 → same as H

      Or if position1: X, then:
          position2: S or X? Wait: X is one letter? So we don't have two X? Only one.
          So position2: must be S? Then L at4? 
             Option J: X at1, S at2, L at4?
          Or position2: L? But L cannot be at2 → forbidden? 
          Or position2: S? Then L at4? 
          Alternatively: position2: S? Then L at4? 
          But if position1: X, position2: S, position4: L → Option J: X,S,then I at3, then L and P at5? 
          Word: X, S, I, L, P? 

But we also have pos5=P? So:

In summary for P at5:

    Word: [1, 2, I, 4, P] 
        Option F: L at1, S at2, X at4 → word: L, S, I, X, P?
        Option G: L at1, X at2, S at4 → word: L, X, I, S, P?
        Option H: S at1, X at2, L at4 → word: S, X, I, L, P?
        Option I: same as H? 
        And Option J: X at1, S at2, L at4 → word: X, S, I, L, P?

L and S placements? Okay? 

But note: in Option F: L at1? Okay? S at2? Also new.

Now, given that we have two alternatives: P at2 or P at5? 

We need to pick one? Or find a word that uses available letters.

Also, note: the new letter X must come from available: B,D,G,H,J,K,M,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, let's think of actual words for each pattern.

First, P at2 pattern:

Option A: word pattern: [L, P, I, S, X] → example: ""LPISX"" → no, not a word.

What about real words? Pattern: L P I S ? 
But the only real words ending with ""IS"" + something? Not common? Or ""IP"" we already have ""IP"" at2-3? 

Consider: ""lapis""? But ""lapis"" has A? Excluded? Invalid.

""klips"" with K? But we haven't tried K. Pattern: with L at1? Then ""KLIPS?"" → not a word? 

""slips"" -> S L I P S? Duplicate S? And without X? But that doesn't use a new letter? We don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? But the secret word must be exactly 5 distinct? Not necessarily? 

But note: we have 5 specific letters? No: wait, we don't! The secret word has P, I, L, S, and one other! So if we don't use a new letter? But we don't know if there are duplicates? 

But from feedback? We had ""flips"" gave S(-) meaning S is present at least once? Doesn't say how many. Similarly for L? But our constraint is that we have at least P, I, L, S? So if we use a word that has, say, two S? It would require? But we don't know.

But for Option A: ""l p i s x"" → no words.

Option B: pattern S P I L ? → ""spilX"" → what words? ""spile"" excluded E? ""spill""? But ""spill"" has two L? Then the fifth letter? Not needed? Wait: ""spill"" (S,P,I,L,L) → does it work? 
    But we know L is in the word? Having two L might be possible? 
    Positions: pos1=S, pos2=P, pos3=I (fixed), pos4=L, pos5=L? But S is at1? L at4 and L at5? 
    Check constraints:
        P at2: okay? But P cannot be at1? But at2 we argued? So allowed? But we have feedback: P cannot be at1 and at4? P at2: not tested? So okay? 
        L: 
            in this pattern: L at4? Forbidden? Because L cannot be at4? Wait: no, we have that L cannot be at2 and at3? 
            But L at4 is fine? 
            Also L at5? That's new? Okay? 
        I? At3: fixed? 
        S? At1: okay? 

    But in the feedback? We haven't been told anything about L at4? So it might be correct? 

    However, ""spill"" is a word, but note: it has duplicate L? And missing a letter? Actually, the secret word is S,P,I,L,L → so the letters are: S,P,I,L → but we have five letters? Wait: it's S,P,I,L,L → so the distinct letters are S,P,I,L → but we know the secret word must have L? And we also have S? But that covers.

But wait: we received feedback that S is present? And L is present? In ""spill"", it's indeed present with duplicates? So possible.

But in Option B pattern? We were going to use a word that ends with L? Or X? 

Without duplicates: ""spild"" not a word.

So ""spill"" fits? But we have not excluded duplicates? 

But let's note: we are using a word that doesn't introduce a new letter? So we might not gain new information? 

Alternatively, back to Case 2: P at5?

Consider P at5 pattern:

Option F: pattern L S I X P? → for example, ""lsixp"" → not a word.

But ""slip?"" we need 5 letters? 

Option G: pattern L X I S P? → ""lisp"" → 4 letters? 

""gawds"" no I? 

Option H: pattern S X I L P? → ""sxilp"" not word. 

What about ""skill""? But K? And double L? And pattern: S,K,I,L? But that's only 4 distinct letters? And P missing? 

We need P? Because P must be in the word? 

Patterns must have P at5? So words ending with P?

For example:
  Option J: pattern X S I L P? → words?:
      B S I L P? → not word.
      G S I L P? → ""gsilp"" not word.
      H S I L P? → ""hsilp"" not word.
      K S I L P? → ""ksilp"" not word.
      M S I L P? → ""msilp"" not word.
      U S I L P? → ""usilp"" not word.

Maybe ""mis"" not? 

Another word: ""was"" not? 

Wait, perhaps ""basil""? But ends at L? L not P? 

Actually? Common words ending with P that have L and S? 

For example, ""crisp"" excluded? 

""grasp"" excluded? 

Or ""clasp"": C excluded? 

""wisp"": but W,I,S,P? And then? But pattern: W at1? S at2? I at3? Then L? There is no L? 

""wisp"" has W,I,S,P -> no L? 

But we need L? 

""lisp""? L,I,S,P -> too short? 

Expand to 5 letters? ""lisps"" -> L,I,S,P,S duplicate S? Word: ""lisps"" → likely not? But it's a word (verb form of lisp?).

""lisps"": L at1, I at2? But in our pattern for Option J: we have to have position 1=X, position 2=S? So ""X S I L P""? 

Therefore, for ""lisps"" → it's L at1, I S P S? Positions: 
  1:L, 2:I, 3:S, 4:P, 5:S? But we need position3=I? So only if position3 is I? But in ""lisps"" position3 is S? 

So mismatch? 

And we have fixed position3=I? 

So only if we put I at3? 

But ""lisps"" would be: 
 position1:L, position2: not I? 

So not working? 

Another word: ""blips""? But we tried? But wait: we haven't, but in our option?

With P at5? 

Or perhaps ""drips""? D,R excluded? 

So hard? 

Let's go back to the previous guess feedback.

We also have ""flips"" feedback: S is in the word but not at position5? And in our pattern it's fine? 

But perhaps we are missing something.

The fifth letter? How about we guess a word that have another common consonant? 

Based on which letter is common? H,K,M, etc.

Given the constraints, a potential word is ""spill"" as we thought? 

But in ""spill"": 
   positions: 1=S, 2=P, 3=I, 4=L, 5=L? That's 5-letter? 
   S at1? okay? 
   P at2? but P was not allowed at1 or at4? At2: okay? 
   I at3? perfect.
   L at4? okay? 
   L at5? duplicate? 

But is a duplicate allowed? We are not sure? But Wordle may have duplicates? It is possible.

However, let's see the feedback: in ""pilot"": we had one L? We have L given as ⇦ in position3? Then in ""flips"": we had L at2 and ⇦? So if the secret word has two L's? Then one appears in a correct position? 

But in ""spill"", we have L at4 and L at5? Then if we guess ""spill"", we might get:

   S at1: unknown?
   P at2: unknown?
   I at3: ✓
   L at4: ? 
   L at5: ?

But we also know L is present? 

However, we don't know if L can be at4? No information.

Also, if there is a duplicate L? 

But it is possible? 

Alternatively, we can try ""slyph""? Not a real word.

""python"" excluded? 

Maybe we need to try a different approach.

Let's list all possible words with I at3? And containing P, L, S? and length 5? 

For example:
- ""spill"" - as above
- ""split""? But T excluded? 
- ""splint""? N and T excluded? 
- ""apply""? A excluded? 
- ""slipe""? E excluded? 
- ""blimp""? but we haven't tried? ""blimp"" has P and I and L, but not S? And no I at3? 

And in ""blimp"": positions not fixed for I at3? 

Or if we put the word ""bless""? not contain P? 

Hard? 

Another possibility: ""polyp"" not? 

Wait, perhaps ""slip"" + another letter? 

Or ""lispy"": L,I,S,P,Y? That might be a word? 

""lispy"": 
   positions: 1=L, 2=I, 3=S, 4=P, 5=Y? 
   But we need position3 to be I? Currently is S? 

So not.

""yappy"" not?

But if we have pattern with S at1: ""s"" and then at4: L? Or something?

Example: ""solid"" no I fixed? 

But we need pattern: ? ? I in3, then at4=P? But P cannot be at4? 

Or at2: P? So ""spild"" not.

With existing available letters, possible words might be:

""build"" no P? 

After researching: ""slips"" is a word? Or ""pliss"" not.

In desperation? ""spils"" is not common.

But let's consider the feedback on L:

We know L is in the word but not at position2 or position3? And position3 is fixed as I? So L must be at1,4, or5? 

And S is in the word, not at5? So S at1,2, or4? 

P at2 or5? 

And one new letter? 

Now, how about the word ""whips"": W,H,I,P,S? 
   positions: 1=W, 2=H, 3=I? But position3=I in the guess? But then at4=P? P cannot be at4! So invalid.

How about ""gassy"" not P.

It's tricky? 

Maybe we try to put P at5? And find a word.

For example: ""dilly"" no P.

Or ""bulky"" no P.

Or ""gulps"": G,U,L,P,S? But 
  positions: 1=G, 2=U, 3=L? But position3 must be I! So cannot.

For the secret word to have I at3, guess must have I at3.

So we must have a 5-letter with I at3, containing P, L, S, and one other? And avoid excluded letters? 

Let's get specific:

A common word: ""bliss""? B,L,I,S,S? -> no P? 

""flail"" has I at3? F,L,A,I,L -> A excluded and no P? 

""to"" not? 

Perhaps not a common word? 

Or ""quilt"" excluded T? 

Another: ""child"" no P? 

Since the letter in question we can choose? How about with H? 

""while"" E excluded? 

 or ""shill"": S,H,I,L,L? This has our letters? S (at1), H, I (at3? if positions: s h i l l), then position3=I? Yes? And L later? 
   Does it have P? No.

""shill"" has no P? 

 with P: ""plash"" A excluded? 

Or  ""shelf"" F excluded? But what about the new feedback? 

We exclude F? From ""flips"": F(x)? 

So F is excluded? 

Let me list: potential words? ""skimp"" has S,K,I,M,P? 
   positions: we can arrange as ? , ? , I, ?, P? Because P at5? 
   But where to put S and K and M? 

If P at5? And I at3? Then:
   positions: 1,2,3,4,5 = ?, ?, I, ?, P

We have letter: S, K, M for positions 1,2,4? 
   S can be at1,2,4? 
   Constraints: 
        If we put S at1? Then 2 must be K or M? And 4=M or K? 

But no specific constraint for K or M? 

So ""skimp"" can be:
   Option: S K I M P? 
      positions: 1=S, 2=K, 3=I, 4=M, 5=P? 
   Check constraints:
        P at5? Allowed? Because only not at1 and not at4? 
        L? We must have L? But we forgot! 

""skimp"" doesn't have L? 

So it misses L? 

Similarly, ""prism"" has R? Excluded? 

"" "" 

W e need L? 

The only word I can think of is ""spill"" with duplicate L? 

Or ""lisps"" with duplicate S and no L? 

Or ""slipp"" not a word. 

Thus, we might need to try ""spill"".

Other options? ""psyll""? Not.

""pupil"": has U,P,I,L? But 
   positions: P,U,P,I,L (or if pupil -> P,U,P,I,L) 
   issues: P at1? Not allowed? Because excluded position for P? In ""pilot"", we put P1 and got wrong? So if we put P at1 in this guess? It would also be wrong? But why put it? 
   But to avoid: we have to have P at safe position? 
   But in this word: we have P at1 and at3? At1 is forbidden? So we put it only at position3? But position3 must be I? 

""pupil"" has P at1 and P at3? But position3 is P? But we have I at3 fixed? 

So not.

Therefore, we must guess ""spill"": S P I L L? 

Let's define the guess: ""spill"" 

Then in terms of feedback? We will get? 
   Position1: S -> if S is in another position? We only know not at5? So might be correct or not? 
   Position2: P -> we know P is in the word, and this is a new position? Previously wrong at1 and4? So now at2? Can be wrong? 
   Position3: I -> ✓ 
   Position4: L -> L's status? We know L not at2 or3? At4? If it's correct? Or if it's in another position? 
   Position5: L -> duplicate? Might be extra? 

But in the secret word, it may not have duplicate L? 

But let's try it? 

Alternatively, we can choose ""blips"" again? But we already know from ""flips"" that I is at3? And ""blips"" does not position I at3? 

If we guess ""blips"" it has I at2? But I forbidden at2? And also at position2. 

So it would be invalid to guess again? 

No: we can guess? But the feedback fromflips tellsusthat I is at3? So we know secret word has I at3? 

So it's better to use that.

Thus, ""spill"" seems like the best bet.

But to be safe, another word: ""shpiel"" too long.

Perhaps ""simper"" long.

I think for now, we guess ""spill"".

But ""spill"" has duplicate L? And we don't know? 

Maybe there's a word with L and S and P and I at3? And a new letter? 

I recall: ""aspic"" excluded letters? 

Or ""crimp"" excluded.

After thinking, one word: ""gipsy"": G,I,P,S,Y? But we need I at3? ""g i p s y"" positions: if I at1? Not at3? 

We can construct: let's try a guess with new letter? 

For example, if we put P at5:
   Pattern: X, S, I, L, P? 

For X choose H: ""H S I L P?"" -> ""hsilp"" not word.

Choose K: ""ksilp"" -> not.

How about ""mis"" (not).

Another idea: what is the word ""fifth""? No.

Perhaps the available letters include U? 

"" U S I L P"" -> ""usilp"" not word.

""quiz"" not.

I think we have to go with ""spill"".

So we'll guess ""spill"".

But note: in ""spill"", L is at4 and L at5? We don't know at4. 

But for the sake of the game, we try it.Based on the feedback from previous guesses and analysis:

- **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, O, T, F (confirmed not in the word).
- **Confirmed letter positions**: 
  - I is in position ③ (fixed and correct).
- **Confirmed present letters but in wrong positions**: 
  - P (cannot be in positions ① or ④).
  - L (cannot be in positions ② or ③).
  - S (cannot be in position ⑤).
- **Secret word composition**: Must contain P, I, L, S, and one unknown letter from the available set (B, D, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

After evaluating possible words that satisfy the constraints:
- P must be in position ② or ⑤.
- L must be in position ①, ④, or ⑤.
- S must be in position ①, ②, or ④.
- The fifth letter is unknown.

One valid word that fits most constraints and tests new letters is **""spill""**:
- Positions:
  - S at ① (S cannot be at ⑤, so position ① is allowable and untested).
  - P at ② (P cannot be at ① or ④, so position ② is allowable and untested).
  - I at ③ (fixed and correct).
  - L at ④ (L cannot be at ② or ③, so position ④ is allowable).
  - L at ⑤ (possible duplicate, acceptable since duplicate letters are allowed in Wordle).
- Benefits: Tests repositioning of P and L, introduces potential new information, and is a common English word.

This guess addresses the constraints:
- P is only at allowable positions (②).
- L is at an allowable position (④).
- S cannot be at ⑤, and is tested at ①.

If ""spill"" is incorrect, the feedback will reveal:
- If S is correctly placed at position ①.
- If P is correctly placed at position ②.
- If L is correctly placed at position ④ or if there are duplicate Ls.
- New clues about letter positions/the unknown fifth letter.",Guess 4: spill -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) P(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
