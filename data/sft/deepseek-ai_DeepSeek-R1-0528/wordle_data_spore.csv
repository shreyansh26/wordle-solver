We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - The letters are all distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

 Let's interpret the feedback:
 - E is correct and in the correct position (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
 - R is present but in the wrong position. So R is in the word, but not in position 2.
 - C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
 - Must end with E: ... E (5th letter is E)
 - Contains the letter R, but not in the 2nd position.
 - Does not contain C, A, N.

 Since R is not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: the word is 5 letters.

 We also know that E is at position 5, so R cannot be at position 5.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4.

 We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
 - Ends with E (so the 5th letter is E)
 - Includes R (but not in the 2nd position)
 - Does not use C, A, N.

 Also, we should avoid reusing letters that are known not to be in the word (C,A,N). However, we can reuse E and R because:
 - E is already confirmed at the end, but note that there might be another E? The feedback only tells us that we have one E in the correct position. There could be more.

 But let me note: the feedback tells us:
   - E(✓) means letter E is at position 5 and also the word has at least one E (but could have more).
   - R(-) means the word has at least one R, but not at position 2.

 We should try to use other common letters that haven't been used. We have used: C,R,A,N,E.

 Available letters: We avoid C,A,N. But note: we can use R again? Actually, in a new guess we can repeat R because we know R is in the word and we are trying to find its position.

 However, we should avoid repeating the same position for R if we know it's not in that position? But we don't know the position yet.

 The goal is to test other positions and include other common letters to eliminate possibilities.

 Let me think of words ending with E that include R, exclude C,A,N, and also try to cover new letters.

 Common letters besides the ones we've already tried: B, D, E (but we already have it at the end), F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Note: We have E at the end. But we don't know about other positions.

 We should avoid putting R in the second position again because we know it's wrong.

 Possible words:

 We need a word structure: 
   Letter1, Letter2, Letter3, Letter4, E

 Constraints:
   Letter2 cannot be R (but it wasn't in our previous guess? In our first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Actually, we know R is not at position 2).

 So positions: 
   Position 2 must not be R.

 And the word must have R in either position 1, 3, or 4.

 Let me think of words that end with E and have R somewhere else than position 2.

 Examples: 
   STORE: S T O R E -> ends with E, has R at position 4. Also, new letters: S, T, O.
   But note: we don't know if T and O are in the word.

 However, we must be cautious: we don't want to use any of the disallowed letters: C, A, N.

 STORE: letters are S,T,O,R,E -> no C, A, N. So this is a candidate.

 Another possibility: PRICE -> but we cannot use C. So not allowed.

 Other words: 
   BRUTE: B R U T E -> ends with E, has R at position 2? But wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that's not correct. In BRUTE, R is at position 2 -> so that would be invalid because we know the secret word does not have R at position 2.

 So we must avoid putting R at position 2.

 Therefore, acceptable word: SHIRE? 
   S H I R E -> R is at position 4? And no C,A,N. And ends with E? Yes.

 However, SHIRE: S H I R E -> R at position 4? Actually positions: 
   Position1: S, Position2: H, Position3: I, Position4: R, Position5: E.

 So R at position4 -> okay.

 Another: STIRE? Maybe not a word? Let me think valid words.

 Instead, let's choose a word that has R in position 1? For example: 
   ROUTE: R O U T E -> R at position1? And ends with E. But note: position2 is O? And we avoid A, C, N? Yes. But is it valid? ROUTE is a valid word.

 But let me think: in ROUTE, the R is at position1. Then O, U, T, E. 

 Why not? It uses new letters: O, U, T. Also, we have the E at the end.

 But we already know that E is at the end? So that's confirmed. We are going to get E(✓) again? Yes, which is expected.

 However, let me consider: we also have the possibility that the secret word might have repeated letters? But no feedback indicates duplicates so far.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in position3? For example: 
   STREP? But note: it ends with A? No. We need it to end with E.

 Words ending with E and R at position3: 
   FORTE: F O R T E -> R at position3? But let me check: 
      F at1, O at2, R at3, T at4, E at5 -> yes.

 But FORTE: letters F,O,R,T,E -> no C,A,N.

 We could try to choose a word that doesn't have R? But wait, we know R is in the word, so we must include R? Actually, we can omit R? But then we wouldn't learn about the position. It's better to include R because we already know it's in the word and we need to locate its position.

 Also, we don't know about the existence of other letters? So including new letters would help.

 So let me think: which word maximizes new information?

 We have 6 tries. So we should try to cover more ground.

 But note: we must avoid A, C, N because they are not in the word.

 Let me list: 
   STORE: letters S, T, O, R, E -> and positions: R is at position4? We want to test position4 for R? 
   ROUTE: R at position1? That tests position1 for R? 
   FORTE: R at position3? That tests position3 for R?

 We might want to test multiple possibilities? But we have to pick one.

 Alternatively, a word that could cover R in position1 and then also test other letters? But we cannot know without trying.

 Since we know E is fixed at the end, we might also test the presence of other vowels? 

 Another idea: We haven't used I? Or S? T? L? etc.

 I think STORE is a good candidate: 
   S: new letter
   T: new letter
   O: new vowel? Actually vowel? O is vowel, we haven't tested any O yet.
   R: we know it's in the word, and putting at position4 (so not position2, which we avoid).
   E: known to be at the end.

 We can check: STORE -> letters: S, T, O, R, E -> all valid.

 Let me confirm: the previous feedback said E is at position5, so STORE ends with E -> position5 is E (that matches). 

 So I'll go with ""STORE"".

 Feedback from STORE would tell us:
   If the first letter is S: if correct we get S(✓), else if present but in other position S(-), else S(x). Similarly for T (position2), O (position3), R (position4), and E (position5) which we already know so it will be (✓) again.

 But note: we expect E to be marked correct again.

 After this we might get more positions narrowed down.

 So the next guess: STORE

 However, note: the feedback from the first guess showed that R is in the word but not at position2. In STORE, R is at position4. So if the secret word has R at position4, we'll get R(✓). If not, then R might be at position1 or position3? Then we will get R(-) and know that position4 is not it.

 Alternatively, if we get R(-) that means R is in the word but not at position4? Then we would know it must be at position1 or position3? Because we already know it's not at position2.

 But wait: what if the word has more than one R? We don't know. It's possible. So we have to be cautious.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put R in position4? To avoid possibly marking it correctly while leaving position1 and position3 untested? But we want to test multiple positions.

 I think STORE is a safe choice because it tests S at position1, T at position2, O at position3, R at position4, and E at position5.

 Moreover, we are testing several new letters.

 Another candidate: ROUTE. Then we would have R at position1, so we test whether R is at the beginning? Then we'd get either (✓) for R at position1 or (->) meaning it's present elsewhere? But if we get (-) on R, it would have to be in position3 or position4? Because position2 we already know is not R? 

 But we don't know about position5? However, position5 is E? So R couldn't be at position5? So if we put R at position1 and it is actually at position3 or 4, then we would get (-) for R? 

 Similarly, with STORE: if R is at position1 or position3, then we will get R(->) for position4? Exactly.

 So I think STORE is good.

 Let me see if STORE is a valid word? It is: STORE is a 5-letter word.

 Therefore, I'll guess STORE.
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **E(✓)** in position 5 means the secret word ends with ""E"".
- **R(-)** confirms ""R"" is in the word but not in position 2.
- **C(x)**, **A(x)**, and **N(x)** mean these letters are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- Must end with **E** (position 5).
- Must include **R**, but not in position 2 (so possible positions are 1, 3, or 4).
- Must exclude **C**, **A**, and **N** to avoid wasted guesses.
- Should introduce new common letters to test their presence/positions.

After considering options like ""ROUTE"" (R at start) and ""FORTE"" (R in position 3), ""STORE"" is chosen because:
- Ends with ""E"" (position 5).
- Places ""R"" in position 4 to test that location.
- Uses new common letters (**S**, **T**, **O**) not yet tested.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).

This guess will provide critical feedback on the positions of S, T, O, and R, while leveraging the known E.

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - The letters are all distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

 Let's interpret the feedback:
 - E is correct and in the correct position (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
 - R is present but in the wrong position. So R is in the word, but not in position 2.
 - C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
 - Must end with E: ... E (5th letter is E)
 - Contains the letter R, but not in the 2nd position.
 - Does not contain C, A, N.

 Since R is not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: the word is 5 letters.

 We also know that E is at position 5, so R cannot be at position 5.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4.

 We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
 - Ends with E (so the 5th letter is E)
 - Includes R (but not in the 2nd position)
 - Does not use C, A, N.

 Also, we should avoid reusing letters that are known not to be in the word (C,A,N). However, we can reuse E and R because:
 - E is already confirmed at the end, but note that there might be another E? The feedback only tells us that we have one E in the correct position. There could be more.

 But let me note: the feedback tells us:
   - E(✓) means letter E is at position 5 and also the word has at least one E (but could have more).
   - R(-) means the word has at least one R, but not at position 2.

 We should try to use other common letters that haven't been used. We have used: C,R,A,N,E.

 Available letters: We avoid C,A,N. But note: we can use R again? Actually, in a new guess we can repeat R because we know R is in the word and we are trying to find its position.

 However, we should avoid repeating the same position for R if we know it's not in that position? But we don't know the position yet.

 The goal is to test other positions and include other common letters to eliminate possibilities.

 Let me think of words ending with E that include R, exclude C,A,N, and also try to cover new letters.

 Common letters besides the ones we've already tried: B, D, E (but we already have it at the end), F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Note: We have E at the end. But we don't know about other positions.

 We should avoid putting R in the second position again because we know it's wrong.

 Possible words:

 We need a word structure: 
   Letter1, Letter2, Letter3, Letter4, E

 Constraints:
   Letter2 cannot be R (but it wasn't in our previous guess? In our first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Actually, we know R is not at position 2).

 So positions: 
   Position 2 must not be R.

 And the word must have R in either position 1, 3, or 4.

 Let me think of words that end with E and have R somewhere else than position 2.

 Examples: 
   STORE: S T O R E -> ends with E, has R at position 4. Also, new letters: S, T, O.
   But note: we don't know if T and O are in the word.

 However, we must be cautious: we don't want to use any of the disallowed letters: C, A, N.

 STORE: letters are S,T,O,R,E -> no C, A, N. So this is a candidate.

 Another possibility: PRICE -> but we cannot use C. So not allowed.

 Other words: 
   BRUTE: B R U T E -> ends with E, has R at position 2? But wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that's not correct. In BRUTE, R is at position 2 -> so that would be invalid because we know the secret word does not have R at position 2.

 So we must avoid putting R at position 2.

 Therefore, acceptable word: SHIRE? 
   S H I R E -> R is at position 4? And no C,A,N. And ends with E? Yes.

 However, SHIRE: S H I R E -> R at position 4? Actually positions: 
   Position1: S, Position2: H, Position3: I, Position4: R, Position5: E.

 So R at position4 -> okay.

 Another: STIRE? Maybe not a word? Let me think valid words.

 Instead, let's choose a word that has R in position 1? For example: 
   ROUTE: R O U T E -> R at position1? And ends with E. But note: position2 is O? And we avoid A, C, N? Yes. But is it valid? ROUTE is a valid word.

 But let me think: in ROUTE, the R is at position1. Then O, U, T, E. 

 Why not? It uses new letters: O, U, T. Also, we have the E at the end.

 But we already know that E is at the end? So that's confirmed. We are going to get E(✓) again? Yes, which is expected.

 However, let me consider: we also have the possibility that the secret word might have repeated letters? But no feedback indicates duplicates so far.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in position3? For example: 
   STREP? But note: it ends with A? No. We need it to end with E.

 Words ending with E and R at position3: 
   FORTE: F O R T E -> R at position3? But let me check: 
      F at1, O at2, R at3, T at4, E at5 -> yes.

 But FORTE: letters F,O,R,T,E -> no C,A,N.

 We could try to choose a word that doesn't have R? But wait, we know R is in the word, so we must include R? Actually, we can omit R? But then we wouldn't learn about the position. It's better to include R because we already know it's in the word and we need to locate its position.

 Also, we don't know about the existence of other letters? So including new letters would help.

 So let me think: which word maximizes new information?

 We have 6 tries. So we should try to cover more ground.

 But note: we must avoid A, C, N because they are not in the word.

 Let me list: 
   STORE: letters S, T, O, R, E -> and positions: R is at position4? We want to test position4 for R? 
   ROUTE: R at position1? That tests position1 for R? 
   FORTE: R at position3? That tests position3 for R?

 We might want to test multiple possibilities? But we have to pick one.

 Alternatively, a word that could cover R in position1 and then also test other letters? But we cannot know without trying.

 Since we know E is fixed at the end, we might also test the presence of other vowels? 

 Another idea: We haven't used I? Or S? T? L? etc.

 I think STORE is a good candidate: 
   S: new letter
   T: new letter
   O: new vowel? Actually vowel? O is vowel, we haven't tested any O yet.
   R: we know it's in the word, and putting at position4 (so not position2, which we avoid).
   E: known to be at the end.

 We can check: STORE -> letters: S, T, O, R, E -> all valid.

 Let me confirm: the previous feedback said E is at position5, so STORE ends with E -> position5 is E (that matches). 

 So I'll go with ""STORE"".

 Feedback from STORE would tell us:
   If the first letter is S: if correct we get S(✓), else if present but in other position S(-), else S(x). Similarly for T (position2), O (position3), R (position4), and E (position5) which we already know so it will be (✓) again.

 But note: we expect E to be marked correct again.

 After this we might get more positions narrowed down.

 So the next guess: STORE

 However, note: the feedback from the first guess showed that R is in the word but not at position2. In STORE, R is at position4. So if the secret word has R at position4, we'll get R(✓). If not, then R might be at position1 or position3? Then we will get R(-) and know that position4 is not it.

 Alternatively, if we get R(-) that means R is in the word but not at position4? Then we would know it must be at position1 or position3? Because we already know it's not at position2.

 But wait: what if the word has more than one R? We don't know. It's possible. So we have to be cautious.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put R in position4? To avoid possibly marking it correctly while leaving position1 and position3 untested? But we want to test multiple positions.

 I think STORE is a safe choice because it tests S at position1, T at position2, O at position3, R at position4, and E at position5.

 Moreover, we are testing several new letters.

 Another candidate: ROUTE. Then we would have R at position1, so we test whether R is at the beginning? Then we'd get either (✓) for R at position1 or (->) meaning it's present elsewhere? But if we get (-) on R, it would have to be in position3 or position4? Because position2 we already know is not R? 

 But we don't know about position5? However, position5 is E? So R couldn't be at position5? So if we put R at position1 and it is actually at position3 or 4, then we would get (-) for R? 

 Similarly, with STORE: if R is at position1 or position3, then we will get R(->) for position4? Exactly.

 So I think STORE is good.

 Let me see if STORE is a valid word? It is: STORE is a 5-letter word.

 Therefore, I'll guess STORE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **E(✓)** in position 5 means the secret word ends with ""E"".
- **R(-)** confirms ""R"" is in the word but not in position 2.
- **C(x)**, **A(x)**, and **N(x)** mean these letters are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- Must end with **E** (position 5).
- Must include **R**, but not in position 2 (so possible positions are 1, 3, or 4).
- Must exclude **C**, **A**, and **N** to avoid wasted guesses.
- Should introduce new common letters to test their presence/positions.

After considering options like ""ROUTE"" (R at start) and ""FORTE"" (R in position 3), ""STORE"" is chosen because:
- Ends with ""E"" (position 5).
- Places ""R"" in position 4 to test that location.
- Uses new common letters (**S**, **T**, **O**) not yet tested.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).

This guess will provide critical feedback on the positions of S, T, O, and R, while leveraging the known E.

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed there).
- C, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: store -> S(✓) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- S is in the correct position (1st). So the secret word starts with S.
- O is in the correct position (3rd). So position 3 is O.
- R is in the correct position (4th). So position 4 is R.
- E is in the correct position (5th). This we already knew.
- T is not in the word (x). So T is absent.

Therefore, from the feedback so far, we know:
- Positions: 1:S, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E
- Missing letter: Position 2 is unknown.
- Letters excluded: C, A, N, T (and also from the first guess, we excluded these).
- Included letters: R is now at position 4 (correct), and we have S, O, R, E in their correct positions.

The secret word structure is: S _ O R E

We need to find the second letter. It must be a letter that is not excluded and hasn't been guessed incorrectly.

Excluded letters so far: C, A, N, T. Also, from our correct positions, we have used S, O, R, E.

We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but so far in feedback we haven't seen any duplicate markings.

Possible letters for the second position: all English letters except excluded ones (C,A,N,T) and not conflicting with any known.

However, we should also consider that we might not have encountered all letters present? But we know the secret word is S? ORE.

What common English words fit S?ORE? 

Examples: 
- STORE? But we guessed STORE and got T(x), so T is not in the word. Therefore, STORE is not the word (and Store would have T, which is excluded).
- We need words like: SHORE, SCORE, SNORE, SPORE, etc.

But let's consider the exclusions: 
- T is excluded, so ""STORE"" is eliminated? Actually, we guessed STORE and got T missing? Therefore, words with T are out? But also:
  - We know SCORE would have C from the first guess? But C was excluded in the first guess (C(x)). So SCORE? But C is excluded? SCORE has C -> not possible? Because C is not in the word.
  - Similarly, SNORE? Has N? But N was excluded? So SNORE is not possible? Because N is excluded (N(x)).
  - SAORE? Not a word.
  - SHORE: H is not excluded? So SHORE is a candidate? 

What about other words:
- SPORE? P is not excluded? 
- SWORE? W?
- SOREX? Not a common word? Sorex is a genus, but let's stick to common words.

Candidate words: 
- SHORE: letters S,H,O,R,E -> H is new and not excluded? 
- SPORE: S,P,O,R,E -> P new.
- SWORE: S,W,O,R,E -> W new.

But note: we must ensure that the guess is a 5-letter English word. Also, since we already have S,O,R,E confirmed, the only unknown is the second letter.

So our goal is to test possible letters for position 2? But note: we have limited tries? We have 4 tries left? (since 2 used).

But also, we can potentially solve the word in the next guess? Because we know four letters.

Therefore, we can make a guess using one of the candidates? 

However, we must check if there are multiple candidates? 

List of common words ending in ORE? 
- SHORE
- SCORE (excluded by C)
- SNORE (excluded by N)
- SPORE
- STORE (excluded by T)
- SWORE
- ADORE? But doesn't start with S? And we have S at position1.
- CORE? But not 5 letters?
- We are looking for S?ORE: mainly SHORE, SPORE, SWORE, and maybe SLOVE? No SLOVE? Instead, there's ""SHOVE""? But that ends with VE? Not ORE.

Other possibilities: SHIRE? But that is SHIR? Not ORE? We have fixed O at position3? 

Wait, the structure is S? O R E -> so possible words: 
- SHORE
- SPORE
- SWORE
- and perhaps SLORE? Not common? 
- Also, SOARE? Which is an old word for hawk? Not very common. We should avoid rare words.

So common ones: SHORE, SPORE, SWORE.

Now, we need to eliminate or guess. We have 3 possibilities? But also, more if we consider less common? But let's assume common words.

We have only 1 incorrect letter we know? We also know that the letters used so far: 
- First guess: C,R,A,N,E -> C,A,N excluded, R and E present.
- Second guess: S,T,O,R,E -> T excluded, S,O,R,E correct.

We don't know about other letters? We need to test the second position to see if it's present? But we have no previous info.

Therefore, we can guess one of the candidate words? 

But note: the risk? If we guess SHORE and it's not right, then we waste a turn? However, we have 4 tries left? And there are about 3-4 candidates? 

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests several possible letters? But that might not be possible because the positions are fixed? We have to fill position2? 

But note: we can use the previous incorrect letters? 

We could guess a word that includes several candidate letters? But the word must have the pattern S?ORE? But we can't change the pattern? Because then we break the known positions? 

Unless we are testing to see if the pattern is correct? Actually, we have multiple (✓) for S,O,R,E so they are fixed? So the word can only be changed in the second letter?

Therefore, we must guess a word that has S in position1, O in position3, R in position4, E in position5, and an unknown letter in position2? 

Therefore, the guess will necessarily be one of the candidate words: SHORE, SPORE, SWORE, or others? 

But let's list: 
- H: we haven't tested H? So if we guess SHORE:
   - Similarly, SPORE: test P?
   - SWORE: test W?

But note: we also have the possibility that there might be other letters? For example, if the second letter is a letter we haven't thought of? 

But we can test by guessing one? 

Since we have multiple candidates, we should pick one? 

Let me consider frequency: 
- H is more common than W? 
- SHORE is a very common word? 

However, to maximize information? But we cannot test multiple at once? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that might reveal the second letter? But we are forced to put a letter at position2? 

Therefore, we guess SHORE first? 

But note: if SHORE is wrong, we learn that H is not present? Then we can try SPORE? And if SPORE is wrong? Then SWORE? 

But we don't know how many possibilities? 

However, in Wordle, the goal is to guess the word? So we can try one? 

But we have 4 tries? So even if we are wrong once? We can still guess?

But to be efficient? Since we are in the third guess? 

Alternatively, we can think: are there any other constraints? 

From previous feedback? We haven't checked? 

But note: the first guess: crane had R marked as present in the wrong position? At position2? We now know that R is now at position4? So at the time of the first guess, R was present but not at position2? Its position was not known? Now we know it's at position4? 

But the word did not have any other R? Because we now have it at position4. 

Therefore, the secret word doesn't have a second R? 

Also, with the structure S?ORE, if we use SHORE, and the word is actually SPORE, then we get information that H is absent? 

Therefore, let us choose SHORE as a guess? 

But note: SPORE has P? Which is common? And SHORE? 

I think SHORE is reasonable? 

But let me see: perhaps we can use a word that doesn't repeat letters? 

Another candidate: SABRE? But then we break the pattern? Because O and R would not be in position? 

We cannot break the pattern? We have to put O at position3 and R at position4? 

So we must use one of the ? in position2? 

Therefore, we pick ""SHORE"" as the next guess? 

But note: SHORE? That is S, H, O, R, E. 

If we guess SHORE, the feedback will tell us: 
- Position1: S? already known? So will be ✓
- Position2: H? if correct then marked ✓? Otherwise, if H is present but in wrong position? But there's no other position? Since the word has fixed letters? Or if H is not in the word, marked x? 
- Similarly, O, R, E will be ✓ because fixed? 

This gives us immediately: if position2 is H? Then we get all ✓. Otherwise, if H is wrong, we get S(✓) H(?) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)? And we know H was tested? 

But if the word is SPORE, and we guess SHORE, then H will be marked either:
- If H is in the word? Then (-)? But would it be? Because SPORE does not have H? So H(x)? 
- Then we know that position2 is not H? 

Similarly, we can try SPORE next? 

But perhaps we can choose a word that tests two possibilities? But that's not possible? 

Alternatively, we can choose a different word? Not fitting the pattern? For example, ""SHIRE""? But that has I? And E at position5? But then position3: I? But we know position3 is O? So SHIRE would mean that I is at position3? But we know that position3 is O? So SHIRE cannot be? 

Therefore, we must stick with S?ORE? 

Thus, I choose ""SHORE"" for the next guess? 

But let me consider: SWORE is also common? 

But why not? 

I think SHORE is a good candidate? 

Alternatively, SPORE? 

But let me see frequency? Common words: SHORE is more common? 

Perhaps we can consider: the word must be a common five-letter word? 

Given that, I'll pick SHORE? 

So guess: ""shore""

But note: we must avoid excluded letters? 
In SHORE: H is not excluded? So okay?

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - E(✓) at position 5 → Secret word ends with **E**.  
  - R(-) at position 2 → **R** is in the word, but not at position 2.  
  - C(x), A(x), N(x) → **C**, **A**, **N** are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (store)**:  
  - S(✓) at position 1 → Secret word starts with **S**.  
  - O(✓) at position 3 → Position 3 is **O**.  
  - R(✓) at position 4 → Position 4 is **R**.  
  - E(✓) at position 5 (confirms prior).  
  - T(x) → **T** is absent.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the structure: **S _ O R E** (unknown at position 2).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, T.  
- **Confirmed letters**: S (position 1), O (position 3), R (position 4), E (position 5).  
- **Position constraints for R**: Initially ruled out position 2 (from Guess 1), now confirmed at position 4 (from Guess 2).  

### Strategy:
- Only position 2 remains unknown, so focus on finding the missing letter.  
- Candidates for position 2 include:  
  - Common English words: **SHORE**, **SPORE**, **SWORE**, etc.  
  - Exclude improbable options:  
    - **SCORE** (C excluded), **SNORE** (N excluded).  
- Prioritize **SHORE**:  
  - Tests **H**, a frequent consonant not yet evaluated.  
  - Highly probable word due to commonality.  
- If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject **H** and reduce candidates (e.g., **SPORE** or **SWORE** next).  

<guess>shore</guess>",shore,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed there).
- C, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: store -> S(✓) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- S is in the correct position (1st). So the secret word starts with S.
- O is in the correct position (3rd). So position 3 is O.
- R is in the correct position (4th). So position 4 is R.
- E is in the correct position (5th). This we already knew.
- T is not in the word (x). So T is absent.

Therefore, from the feedback so far, we know:
- Positions: 1:S, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E
- Missing letter: Position 2 is unknown.
- Letters excluded: C, A, N, T (and also from the first guess, we excluded these).
- Included letters: R is now at position 4 (correct), and we have S, O, R, E in their correct positions.

The secret word structure is: S _ O R E

We need to find the second letter. It must be a letter that is not excluded and hasn't been guessed incorrectly.

Excluded letters so far: C, A, N, T. Also, from our correct positions, we have used S, O, R, E.

We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but so far in feedback we haven't seen any duplicate markings.

Possible letters for the second position: all English letters except excluded ones (C,A,N,T) and not conflicting with any known.

However, we should also consider that we might not have encountered all letters present? But we know the secret word is S? ORE.

What common English words fit S?ORE? 

Examples: 
- STORE? But we guessed STORE and got T(x), so T is not in the word. Therefore, STORE is not the word (and Store would have T, which is excluded).
- We need words like: SHORE, SCORE, SNORE, SPORE, etc.

But let's consider the exclusions: 
- T is excluded, so ""STORE"" is eliminated? Actually, we guessed STORE and got T missing? Therefore, words with T are out? But also:
  - We know SCORE would have C from the first guess? But C was excluded in the first guess (C(x)). So SCORE? But C is excluded? SCORE has C -> not possible? Because C is not in the word.
  - Similarly, SNORE? Has N? But N was excluded? So SNORE is not possible? Because N is excluded (N(x)).
  - SAORE? Not a word.
  - SHORE: H is not excluded? So SHORE is a candidate? 

What about other words:
- SPORE? P is not excluded? 
- SWORE? W?
- SOREX? Not a common word? Sorex is a genus, but let's stick to common words.

Candidate words: 
- SHORE: letters S,H,O,R,E -> H is new and not excluded? 
- SPORE: S,P,O,R,E -> P new.
- SWORE: S,W,O,R,E -> W new.

But note: we must ensure that the guess is a 5-letter English word. Also, since we already have S,O,R,E confirmed, the only unknown is the second letter.

So our goal is to test possible letters for position 2? But note: we have limited tries? We have 4 tries left? (since 2 used).

But also, we can potentially solve the word in the next guess? Because we know four letters.

Therefore, we can make a guess using one of the candidates? 

However, we must check if there are multiple candidates? 

List of common words ending in ORE? 
- SHORE
- SCORE (excluded by C)
- SNORE (excluded by N)
- SPORE
- STORE (excluded by T)
- SWORE
- ADORE? But doesn't start with S? And we have S at position1.
- CORE? But not 5 letters?
- We are looking for S?ORE: mainly SHORE, SPORE, SWORE, and maybe SLOVE? No SLOVE? Instead, there's ""SHOVE""? But that ends with VE? Not ORE.

Other possibilities: SHIRE? But that is SHIR? Not ORE? We have fixed O at position3? 

Wait, the structure is S? O R E -> so possible words: 
- SHORE
- SPORE
- SWORE
- and perhaps SLORE? Not common? 
- Also, SOARE? Which is an old word for hawk? Not very common. We should avoid rare words.

So common ones: SHORE, SPORE, SWORE.

Now, we need to eliminate or guess. We have 3 possibilities? But also, more if we consider less common? But let's assume common words.

We have only 1 incorrect letter we know? We also know that the letters used so far:

But note: SHORE? That is S, H, O, R, E.

- Position2: H? if correct then marked ✓? Otherwise, if H is present but in wrong position? But there's no other position? Since the word has fixed letters? Or if H is not in the word, marked x?

This gives us immediately: if position2 is H? Then we get all ✓. Otherwise, if H is wrong, we get S(✓) H(?) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)? And we know H was tested? 

But if the word is SPORE, and we guess SHORE, then H will be marked either:
- If H is in the word? Then (-)? But would it be? Because SPORE does not have H? So H(x)? 
- Then we know that position2 is not H? 

Similarly, we can try SPORE next? 

But perhaps we can choose a word that tests two possibilities? But that's not possible? 

Alternatively, we can choose a different word? Not fitting the pattern? For example, ""SHIRE""? But that has I? And E at position5? But then position3: I? But we know position3 is O? So SHIRE would mean that I is at position3? But we know that position3 is O? So SHIRE cannot be?

<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose a word that has common vowels and consonants. I'll go with ""CRANE"" because:
 - It has three vowels (A, E) and two common consonants (C, R).
 - The letters are all distinct.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback from the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)

 Let's interpret the feedback:
 - E is correct and in the correct position (position 5). So the secret word ends with E.
 - R is present but in the wrong position. So R is in the word, but not in position 2.
 - C, A, N are not in the word at all.

 Therefore, the secret word:
 - Must end with E: ... E (5th letter is E)
 - Contains the letter R, but not in the 2nd position.
 - Does not contain C, A, N.

 Since R is not in position 2, it could be in position 1, 3, or 4? But note: the word is 5 letters.

 We also know that E is at position 5, so R cannot be at position 5.

 Possible positions for R: 1, 3, or 4.

 We need to guess a 5-letter word that:
 - Ends with E (so the 5th letter is E)
 - Includes R (but not in the 2nd position)
 - Does not use C, A, N.

 Also, we should avoid reusing letters that are known not to be in the word (C,A,N). However, we can reuse E and R because:
 - E is already confirmed at the end, but note that there might be another E? The feedback only tells us that we have one E in the correct position. There could be more.

 But let me note: the feedback tells us:
   - E(✓) means letter E is at position 5 and also the word has at least one E (but could have more).
   - R(-) means the word has at least one R, but not at position 2.

 We should try to use other common letters that haven't been used. We have used: C,R,A,N,E.

 Available letters: We avoid C,A,N. But note: we can use R again? Actually, in a new guess we can repeat R because we know R is in the word and we are trying to find its position.

 However, we should avoid repeating the same position for R if we know it's not in that position? But we don't know the position yet.

 The goal is to test other positions and include other common letters to eliminate possibilities.

 Let me think of words ending with E that include R, exclude C,A,N, and also try to cover new letters.

 Common letters besides the ones we've already tried: B, D, E (but we already have it at the end), F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 Note: We have E at the end. But we don't know about other positions.

 We should avoid putting R in the second position again because we know it's wrong.

 Possible words:

 We need a word structure: 
   Letter1, Letter2, Letter3, Letter4, E

 Constraints:
   Letter2 cannot be R (but it wasn't in our previous guess? In our first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Actually, we know R is not at position 2).

 So positions: 
   Position 2 must not be R.

 And the word must have R in either position 1, 3, or 4.

 Let me think of words that end with E and have R somewhere else than position 2.

 Examples: 
   STORE: S T O R E -> ends with E, has R at position 4. Also, new letters: S, T, O.
   But note: we don't know if T and O are in the word.

 However, we must be cautious: we don't want to use any of the disallowed letters: C, A, N.

 STORE: letters are S,T,O,R,E -> no C, A, N. So this is a candidate.

 Another possibility: PRICE -> but we cannot use C. So not allowed.

 Other words: 
   BRUTE: B R U T E -> ends with E, has R at position 2? But wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that's not correct. In BRUTE, R is at position 2 -> so that would be invalid because we know the secret word does not have R at position 2.

 So we must avoid putting R at position 2.

 Therefore, acceptable word: SHIRE? 
   S H I R E -> R is at position 4? And no C,A,N. And ends with E? Yes.

 However, SHIRE: S H I R E -> R at position 4? Actually positions: 
   Position1: S, Position2: H, Position3: I, Position4: R, Position5: E.

 So R at position4 -> okay.

 Another: STIRE? Maybe not a word? Let me think valid words.

 Instead, let's choose a word that has R in position 1? For example: 
   ROUTE: R O U T E -> R at position1? And ends with E. But note: position2 is O? And we avoid A, C, N? Yes. But is it valid? ROUTE is a valid word.

 But let me think: in ROUTE, the R is at position1. Then O, U, T, E. 

 Why not? It uses new letters: O, U, T. Also, we have the E at the end.

 But we already know that E is at the end? So that's confirmed. We are going to get E(✓) again? Yes, which is expected.

 However, let me consider: we also have the possibility that the secret word might have repeated letters? But no feedback indicates duplicates so far.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in position3? For example: 
   STREP? But note: it ends with A? No. We need it to end with E.

 Words ending with E and R at position3: 
   FORTE: F O R T E -> R at position3? But let me check: 
      F at1, O at2, R at3, T at4, E at5 -> yes.

 But FORTE: letters F,O,R,T,E -> no C,A,N.

 We could try to choose a word that doesn't have R? But wait, we know R is in the word, so we must include R? Actually, we can omit R? But then we wouldn't learn about the position. It's better to include R because we already know it's in the word and we need to locate its position.

 Also, we don't know about the existence of other letters? So including new letters would help.

 So let me think: which word maximizes new information?

 We have 6 tries. So we should try to cover more ground.

 But note: we must avoid A, C, N because they are not in the word.

 Let me list: 
   STORE: letters S, T, O, R, E -> and positions: R is at position4? We want to test position4 for R? 
   ROUTE: R at position1? That tests position1 for R? 
   FORTE: R at position3? That tests position3 for R?

 We might want to test multiple possibilities? But we have to pick one.

 Alternatively, a word that could cover R in position1 and then also test other letters? But we cannot know without trying.

 Since we know E is fixed at the end, we might also test the presence of other vowels? 

 Another idea: We haven't used I? Or S? T? L? etc.

 I think STORE is a good candidate: 
   S: new letter
   T: new letter
   O: new vowel? Actually vowel? O is vowel, we haven't tested any O yet.
   R: we know it's in the word, and putting at position4 (so not position2, which we avoid).
   E: known to be at the end.

 We can check: STORE -> letters: S, T, O, R, E -> all valid.

 Let me confirm: the previous feedback said E is at position5, so STORE ends with E -> position5 is E (that matches). 

 So I'll go with ""STORE"".

 Feedback from STORE would tell us:
   If the first letter is S: if correct we get S(✓), else if present but in other position S(-), else S(x). Similarly for T (position2), O (position3), R (position4), and E (position5) which we already know so it will be (✓) again.

 But note: we expect E to be marked correct again.

 After this we might get more positions narrowed down.

 So the next guess: STORE

 However, note: the feedback from the first guess showed that R is in the word but not at position2. In STORE, R is at position4. So if the secret word has R at position4, we'll get R(✓). If not, then R might be at position1 or position3? Then we will get R(-) and know that position4 is not it.

 Alternatively, if we get R(-) that means R is in the word but not at position4? Then we would know it must be at position1 or position3? Because we already know it's not at position2.

 But wait: what if the word has more than one R? We don't know. It's possible. So we have to be cautious.

 Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put R in position4? To avoid possibly marking it correctly while leaving position1 and position3 untested? But we want to test multiple positions.

 I think STORE is a safe choice because it tests S at position1, T at position2, O at position3, R at position4, and E at position5.

 Moreover, we are testing several new letters.

 Another candidate: ROUTE. Then we would have R at position1, so we test whether R is at the beginning? Then we'd get either (✓) for R at position1 or (->) meaning it's present elsewhere? But if we get (-) on R, it would have to be in position3 or position4? Because position2 we already know is not R? 

 But we don't know about position5? However, position5 is E? So R couldn't be at position5? So if we put R at position1 and it is actually at position3 or 4, then we would get (-) for R? 

 Similarly, with STORE: if R is at position1 or position3, then we will get R(->) for position4? Exactly.

 So I think STORE is good.

 Let me see if STORE is a valid word? It is: STORE is a 5-letter word.

 Therefore, I'll guess STORE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":
- **E(✓)** in position 5 means the secret word ends with ""E"".
- **R(-)** confirms ""R"" is in the word but not in position 2.
- **C(x)**, **A(x)**, and **N(x)** mean these letters are not in the word.

For the next guess:
- Must end with **E** (position 5).
- Must include **R**, but not in position 2 (so possible positions are 1, 3, or 4).
- Must exclude **C**, **A**, and **N** to avoid wasted guesses.
- Should introduce new common letters to test their presence/positions.

After considering options like ""ROUTE"" (R at start) and ""FORTE"" (R in position 3), ""STORE"" is chosen because:
- Ends with ""E"" (position 5).
- Places ""R"" in position 4 to test that location.
- Uses new common letters (**S**, **T**, **O**) not yet tested.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).

This guess will provide critical feedback on the positions of S, T, O, and R, while leveraging the known E.

<guess>store</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Guess 2: store -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).
- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed there).
- C, A, N are not in the word.

Guess 2: store -> S(✓) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- S is in the correct position (1st). So the secret word starts with S.
- O is in the correct position (3rd). So position 3 is O.
- R is in the correct position (4th). So position 4 is R.
- E is in the correct position (5th). This we already knew.
- T is not in the word (x). So T is absent.

Therefore, from the feedback so far, we know:
- Positions: 1:S, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E
- Missing letter: Position 2 is unknown.
- Letters excluded: C, A, N, T (and also from the first guess, we excluded these).
- Included letters: R is now at position 4 (correct), and we have S, O, R, E in their correct positions.

The secret word structure is: S _ O R E

We need to find the second letter. It must be a letter that is not excluded and hasn't been guessed incorrectly.

Excluded letters so far: C, A, N, T. Also, from our correct positions, we have used S, O, R, E.

We don't know if the word has repeated letters, but so far in feedback we haven't seen any duplicate markings.

Possible letters for the second position: all English letters except excluded ones (C,A,N,T) and not conflicting with any known.

However, we should also consider that we might not have encountered all letters present? But we know the secret word is S? ORE.

What common English words fit S?ORE? 

Examples: 
- STORE? But we guessed STORE and got T(x), so T is not in the word. Therefore, STORE is not the word (and Store would have T, which is excluded).
- We need words like: SHORE, SCORE, SNORE, SPORE, etc.

But let's consider the exclusions: 
- T is excluded, so ""STORE"" is eliminated? Actually, we guessed STORE and got T missing? Therefore, words with T are out? But also:
  - We know SCORE would have C from the first guess? But C was excluded in the first guess (C(x)). So SCORE? But C is excluded? SCORE has C -> not possible? Because C is not in the word.
  - Similarly, SNORE? Has N? But N was excluded? So SNORE is not possible? Because N is excluded (N(x)).
  - SAORE? Not a word.
  - SHORE: H is not excluded? So SHORE is a candidate? 

What about other words:
- SPORE? P is not excluded? 
- SWORE? W?
- SOREX? Not a common word? Sorex is a genus, but let's stick to common words.

Candidate words: 
- SHORE: letters S,H,O,R,E -> H is new and not excluded? 
- SPORE: S,P,O,R,E -> P new.
- SWORE: S,W,O,R,E -> W new.

But note: we must ensure that the guess is a 5-letter English word. Also, since we already have S,O,R,E confirmed, the only unknown is the second letter.

So our goal is to test possible letters for position 2? But note: we have limited tries? We have 4 tries left? (since 2 used).

But also, we can potentially solve the word in the next guess? Because we know four letters.

Therefore, we can make a guess using one of the candidates? 

However, we must check if there are multiple candidates? 

List of common words ending in ORE? 
- SHORE
- SCORE (excluded by C)
- SNORE (excluded by N)
- SPORE
- STORE (excluded by T)
- SWORE
- ADORE? But doesn't start with S? And we have S at position1.
- CORE? But not 5 letters?
- We are looking for S?ORE: mainly SHORE, SPORE, SWORE, and maybe SLOVE? No SLOVE? Instead, there's ""SHOVE""? But that ends with VE? Not ORE.

Other possibilities: SHIRE? But that is SHIR? Not ORE? We have fixed O at position3? 

Wait, the structure is S? O R E -> so possible words: 
- SHORE
- SPORE
- SWORE
- and perhaps SLORE? Not common? 
- Also, SOARE? Which is an old word for hawk? Not very common. We should avoid rare words.

So common ones: SHORE, SPORE, SWORE.

Now, we need to eliminate or guess. We have 3 possibilities? But also, more if we consider less common? But let's assume common words.

We have only 1 incorrect letter we know? We also know that the letters used so far: 
- First guess: C,R,A,N,E -> C,A,N excluded, R and E present.
- Second guess: S,T,O,R,E -> T excluded, S,O,R,E correct.

We don't know about other letters? We need to test the second position to see if it's present? But we have no previous info.

Therefore, we can guess one of the candidate words? 

But note: the risk? If we guess SHORE and it's not right, then we waste a turn? However, we have 4 tries left? And there are about 3-4 candidates? 

Alternatively, we could guess a word that tests several possible letters? But that might not be possible because the positions are fixed? We have to fill position2? 

But note: we can use the previous incorrect letters? 

We could guess a word that includes several candidate letters? But the word must have the pattern S?ORE? But we can't change the pattern? Because then we break the known positions? 

Unless we are testing to see if the pattern is correct? Actually, we have multiple (✓) for S,O,R,E so they are fixed? So the word can only be changed in the second letter?

Therefore, we must guess a word that has S in position1, O in position3, R in position4, E in position5, and an unknown letter in position2? 

Therefore, the guess will necessarily be one of the candidate words: SHORE, SPORE, SWORE, or others? 

But let's list: 
- H: we haven't tested H? So if we guess SHORE:
   - Similarly, SPORE: test P?
   - SWORE: test W?

But note: we also have the possibility that there might be other letters? For example, if the second letter is a letter we haven't thought of? 

But we can test by guessing one? 

Since we have multiple candidates, we should pick one? 

Let me consider frequency: 
- H is more common than W? 
- SHORE is a very common word? 

However, to maximize information? But we cannot test multiple at once? 

Alternatively, we can choose a word that might reveal the second letter? But we are forced to put a letter at position2? 

Therefore, we guess SHORE first? 

But note: if SHORE is wrong, we learn that H is not present? Then we can try SPORE? And if SPORE is wrong? Then SWORE? 

But we don't know how many possibilities? 

However, in Wordle, the goal is to guess the word? So we can try one? 

But we have 4 tries? So even if we are wrong once? We can still guess?

But to be efficient? Since we are in the third guess? 

Alternatively, we can think: are there any other constraints? 

From previous feedback? We haven't checked? 

But note: the first guess: crane had R marked as present in the wrong position? At position2? We now know that R is now at position4? So at the time of the first guess, R was present but not at position2? Its position was not known? Now we know it's at position4? 

But the word did not have any other R? Because we now have it at position4. 

Therefore, the secret word doesn't have a second R? 

Also, with the structure S?ORE, if we use SHORE, and the word is actually SPORE, then we get information that H is absent? 

Therefore, let us choose SHORE as a guess? 

But note: SPORE has P? Which is common? And SHORE? 

I think SHORE is reasonable? 

But let me see: perhaps we can use a word that doesn't repeat letters? 

Another candidate: SABRE? But then we break the pattern? Because O and R would not be in position? 

We cannot break the pattern? We have to put O at position3 and R at position4? 

So we must use one of the ? in position2? 

Therefore, we pick ""SHORE"" as the next guess? 

But note: SHORE? That is S, H, O, R, E. 

If we guess SHORE, the feedback will tell us: 
- Position1: S? already known? So will be ✓
- Position2: H? if correct then marked ✓? Otherwise, if H is present but in wrong position? But there's no other position? Since the word has fixed letters? Or if H is not in the word, marked x? 
- Similarly, O, R, E will be ✓ because fixed? 

This gives us immediately: if position2 is H? Then we get all ✓. Otherwise, if H is wrong, we get S(✓) H(?) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)? And we know H was tested? 

But if the word is SPORE, and we guess SHORE, then H will be marked either:
- If H is in the word? Then (-)? But would it be? Because SPORE does not have H? So H(x)? 
- Then we know that position2 is not H? 

Similarly, we can try SPORE next? 

But perhaps we can choose a word that tests two possibilities? But that's not possible? 

Alternatively, we can choose a different word? Not fitting the pattern? For example, ""SHIRE""? But that has I? And E at position5? But then position3: I? But we know position3 is O? So SHIRE would mean that I is at position3? But we know that position3 is O? So SHIRE cannot be? 

Therefore, we must stick with S?ORE? 

Thus, I choose ""SHORE"" for the next guess? 

But let me consider: SWORE is also common? 

But why not? 

I think SHORE is a good candidate? 

Alternatively, SPORE? 

But let me see frequency? Common words: SHORE is more common? 

Perhaps we can consider: the word must be a common five-letter word? 

Given that, I'll pick SHORE? 

So guess: ""shore""

But note: we must avoid excluded letters? 
In SHORE: H is not excluded? So okay?### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  - E(✓) at position 5 → Secret word ends with **E**.  
  - R(-) at position 2 → **R** is in the word, but not at position 2.  
  - C(x), A(x), N(x) → **C**, **A**, **N** are absent.  
- **Guess 2 (store)**:  
  - S(✓) at position 1 → Secret word starts with **S**.  
  - O(✓) at position 3 → Position 3 is **O**.  
  - R(✓) at position 4 → Position 4 is **R**.  
  - E(✓) at position 5 (confirms prior).  
  - T(x) → **T** is absent.  

### Deductions:
- The secret word has the structure: **S _ O R E** (unknown at position 2).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, T.  
- **Confirmed letters**: S (position 1), O (position 3), R (position 4), E (position 5).  
- **Position constraints for R**: Initially ruled out position 2 (from Guess 1), now confirmed at position 4 (from Guess 2).  

### Strategy:
- Only position 2 remains unknown, so focus on finding the missing letter.  
- Candidates for position 2 include:  
  - Common English words: **SHORE**, **SPORE**, **SWORE**, etc.  
  - Exclude improbable options:  
    - **SCORE** (C excluded), **SNORE** (N excluded).  
- Prioritize **SHORE**:  
  - Tests **H**, a frequent consonant not yet evaluated.  
  - Highly probable word due to commonality.  
- If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject **H** and reduce candidates (e.g., **SPORE** or **SWORE** next).

There could be more.\n\n But let me note: the feedback tells us:\n   - E(✓) means letter E is at position 5 and also the word has at least one E (but could have more).\n   - R(-) means the word has at least one R, but not at position 2.\n\n We should try to use other common letters that haven\'t been used. We have used: C,R,A,N,E.\n\n Available letters: We avoid C,A,N. But note: we can use R again?

But we don\'t know the position yet.\n\n The goal is to test other positions and include other common letters to eliminate possibilities.\n\n Let me think of words ending with E that include R, exclude C,A,N, and also try to cover new letters.\n\n Common letters besides the ones we\'ve already tried: B, D, E (but we already have it at the end), F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\n Note: We have E at the end. But we don\'t know about other positions.\n\n We should avoid putting R in the second position again because we know it\'s wrong.\n\n Possible words:\n\n We need a word structure: \n   Letter1, Letter2, Letter3, Letter4, E\n\n Constraints:\n   Letter2 cannot be R (but it wasn\'t in our previous guess? In our first guess, we had R in position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. Actually, we know R is not at position 2).\n\n So positions: \n   Position 2 must not be R.\n\n And the word must have R in either position 1, 3, or 4.\n\n Let me think of words that end with E and have R somewhere else than position 2.\n\n Examples: \n   STORE: S T O R E -> ends with E, has R at position 4. Also, new letters: S, T, O.\n   But note: we don\'t know if T and O are in the word.\n\n However, we must be cautious: we don\'t want to use any of the disallowed letters: C, A, N.\n\n STORE: letters are S,T,O,R,E -> no C, A, N. So this is a candidate.\n\n Another possibility: PRICE -> but we cannot use C. So not allowed.\n\n Other words: \n   BRUTE: B R U T E -> ends with E, has R at position 2? But wait, we cannot put R at position 2 because we know that\'s not correct. In BRUTE, R is at position 2 -> so that would be invalid because we know the secret word does not have R at position 2.\n\n So we must avoid putting R at position 2.\n\n Therefore, acceptable word: SHIRE? \n   S H I R E -> R is at position 4? And no C,A,N. And ends with E? Yes.\n\n However, SHIRE: S H I R E -> R at position 4? Actually positions: \n   Position1: S, Position2: H, Position3: I, Position4: R, Position5: E.\n\n So R at position4 -> okay.\n\n Another: STIRE? Maybe not a word? Let me think valid words.\n\n Instead, let\'s choose a word that has R in position 1? For example: \n   ROUTE: R O U T E -> R at position1? And ends with E. But note: position2 is O? And we avoid A, C, N? Yes. But is it valid? ROUTE is a valid word.\n\n But let me think: in ROUTE, the R is at position1. Then O, U, T, E. \n\n Why not? It uses new letters: O, U, T. Also, we have the E at the end.\n\n But we already know that E is at the end? So that\'s confirmed. We are going to get E(✓) again? Yes, which is expected.\n\n However, let me consider: we also have the possibility that the secret word might have repeated letters? But no feedback indicates duplicates so far.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that puts R in position3? For example: \n   STREP? But note: it ends with A? No. We need it to end with E.\n\n Words ending with E and R at position3: \n   FORTE: F O R T E -> R at position3? But let me check: \n      F at1, O at2, R at3, T at4, E at5 -> yes.\n\n But FORTE: letters F,O,R,T,E -> no C,A,N.\n\n We could try to choose a word that doesn\'t have R? But wait, we know R is in the word, so we must include R? Actually, we can omit R? But then we wouldn\'t learn about the position. It\'s better to include R because we already know it\'s in the word and we need to locate its position.\n\n Also, we don\'t know about the existence of other letters? So including new letters would help.\n\n So let me think: which word maximizes new information?\n\n We have 6 tries. So we should try to cover more ground.\n\n But note: we must avoid A, C, N because they are not in the word.\n\n Let me list: \n   STORE: letters S, T, O, R, E -> and positions: R is at position4? We want to test position4 for R? \n   ROUTE: R at position1? That tests position1 for R? \n   FORTE: R at position3? That tests position3 for R?\n\n We might want to test multiple possibilities? But we have to pick one.\n\n Alternatively, a word that could cover R in position1 and then also test other letters? But we cannot know without trying.\n\n Since we know E is fixed at the end, we might also test the presence of other vowels? \n\n Another idea: We haven\'t used I? Or S? T? L? etc.\n\n I think STORE is a good candidate: \n   S: new letter\n   T: new letter\n   O: new vowel? Actually vowel? O is vowel, we haven\'t tested any O yet.\n   R: we know it\'s in the word, and putting at position4 (so not position2, which we avoid).\n   E: known to be at the end.\n\n We can check: STORE -> letters: S, T, O, R, E -> all valid.\n\n Let me confirm: the previous feedback said E is at position5, so STORE ends with E -> position5 is E (that matches). \n\n So I\'ll go with ""STORE"".\n\n Feedback from STORE would tell us:\n   If the first letter is S: if correct we get S(✓), else if present but in other position S(-), else S(x). Similarly for T (position2), O (position3), R (position4), and E (position5) which we already know so it will be (✓) again.\n\n But note: we expect E to be marked correct again.\n\n After this we might get more positions narrowed down.\n\n So the next guess: STORE\n\n However, note: the feedback from the first guess showed that R is in the word but not at position2. In STORE, R is at position4. So if the secret word has R at position4, we\'ll get R(✓). If not, then R might be at position1 or position3? Then we will get R(-) and know that position4 is not it.\n\n Alternatively, if we get R(-) that means R is in the word but not at position4? Then we would know it must be at position1 or position3? Because we already know it\'s not at position2.\n\n But wait: what if the word has more than one R? We don\'t know. It\'s possible. So we have to be cautious.\n\n Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put R in position4? To avoid possibly marking it correctly while leaving position1 and position3 untested? But we want to test multiple positions.\n\n I think STORE is a safe choice because it tests S at position1, T at position2, O at position3, R at position4, and E at position5.\n\n Moreover, we are testing several new letters.\n\n Another candidate: ROUTE. Then we would have R at position1, so we test whether R is at the beginning? Then we\'d get either (✓) for R at position1 or (->) meaning it\'s present elsewhere? But if we get (-) on R, it would have to be in position3 or position4? Because position2 we already know is not R? \n\n But we don\'t know about position5? However, position5 is E? So R couldn\'t be at position5? So if we put R at position1 and it is actually at position3 or 4, then we would get (-) for R? \n\n Similarly, with STORE: if R is at position1 or position3, then we will get R(->) for position4? Exactly.\n\n So I think STORE is good.\n\n Let me see if STORE is a valid word? It is: STORE is a 5-letter word.\n\n Therefore, I\'ll guess STORE.Based on the feedback from the first guess ""CRANE"":\n- **E(✓)** in position 5 means the secret word ends with ""E"".\n- **R(-)** confirms ""R"" is in the word but not in position 2.\n- **C(x)**, **A(x)**, and **N(x)** mean these letters are not in the word.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must end with **E** (position 5).\n- Must include **R**, but not in position 2 (so possible positions are 1, 3, or 4).\n- Must exclude **C**, **A**, and **N** to avoid wasted guesses.\n- Should introduce new common letters to test their presence/positions.\n\nAfter considering options like ""ROUTE"" (R at start) and ""FORTE"" (R in position 3), ""STORE"" is chosen because:\n- Ends with ""E"" (position 5).\n- Places ""R"" in position 4 to test that location.\n- Uses new common letters (**S**, **T**, **O**) not yet tested.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).\n\nThis guess will provide critical feedback on the positions of S, T, O, and R, while leveraging the known E.\n\n<guess>store</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: store -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nInterpretation:\n- E is in the word and in the correct position (5th).\n- R is in the word but not in position 2 (since it was guessed there).\n- C, A, N are not in the word.\n\nGuess 2: store -> S(✓) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\nInterpretation:\n- S is in the correct position (1st).

So T is absent.\n\nTherefore, from the feedback so far, we know:\n- Positions: 1:S, 3:O, 4:R, 5:E\n- Missing letter: Position 2 is unknown.\n- Letters excluded: C, A, N, T (and also from the first guess, we excluded these).\n- Included letters: R is now at position 4 (correct), and we have S, O, R, E in their correct positions.\n\nThe secret word structure is: S _ O R E\n\nWe need to find the second letter. It must be a letter that is not excluded and hasn\'t been guessed incorrectly.\n\nExcluded letters so far: C, A, N, T. Also, from our correct positions, we have used S, O, R, E.\n\nWe don\'t know if the word has repeated letters, but so far in feedback we haven\'t seen any duplicate markings.\n\nPossible letters for the second position: all English letters except excluded ones (C,A,N,T) and not conflicting with any known.\n\nHowever, we should also consider that we might not have encountered all letters present? But we know the secret word is S? ORE.\n\nWhat common English words fit S?ORE? \n\nExamples: \n- STORE? But we guessed STORE and got T(x), so T is not in the word. Therefore, STORE is not the word (and Store would have T, which is excluded).\n- We need words like: SHORE, SCORE, SNORE, SPORE, etc.\n\nBut let\'s consider the exclusions: \n- T is excluded, so ""STORE"" is eliminated? Actually, we guessed STORE and got T missing? Therefore, words with T are out? But also:\n  - We know SCORE would have C from the first guess? But C was excluded in the first guess (C(x)). So SCORE? But C is excluded? SCORE has C -> not possible? Because C is not in the word.\n  - Similarly, SNORE? Has N? But N was excluded? So SNORE is not possible? Because N is excluded (N(x)).\n  - SAORE? Not a word.\n  - SHORE: H is not excluded? So SHORE is a candidate? \n\nWhat about other words:\n- SPORE? P is not excluded? \n- SWORE? W?\n- SOREX? Not a common word? Sorex is a genus, but let\'s stick to common words.\n\nCandidate words: \n- SHORE: letters S,H,O,R,E -> H is new and not excluded? \n- SPORE: S,P,O,R,E -> P new.\n- SWORE: S,W,O,R,E -> W new.\n\nBut note: we must ensure that the guess is a 5-letter English word. Also, since we already have S,O,R,E confirmed, the only unknown is the second letter.\n\nSo our goal is to test possible letters for position 2? But note: we have limited tries? We have 4 tries left? (since 2 used).\n\nBut also, we can potentially solve the word in the next guess? Because we know four letters.\n\nTherefore, we can make a guess using one of the candidates? \n\nHowever, we must check if there are multiple candidates? \n\nList of common words ending in ORE? \n- SHORE\n- SCORE (excluded by C)\n- SNORE (excluded by N)\n- SPORE\n- STORE (excluded by T)\n- SWORE\n- ADORE? But doesn\'t start with S? And we have S at position1.\n- CORE? But not 5 letters?\n- We are looking for S?ORE: mainly SHORE, SPORE, SWORE, and maybe SLOVE? No SLOVE? Instead, there\'s ""SHOVE""? But that ends with VE? Not ORE.\n\nOther possibilities: SHIRE? But that is SHIR? Not ORE? We have fixed O at position3? \n\nWait, the structure is S? O R E -> so possible words: \n- SHORE\n- SPORE\n- SWORE\n- and perhaps SLORE? Not common? \n- Also, SOARE? Which is an old word for hawk? Not very common. We should avoid rare words.\n\nSo common ones: SHORE, SPORE, SWORE.\n\nNow, we need to eliminate or guess. We have 3 possibilities? But also, more if we consider less common? But let\'s assume common words.\n\nWe have only 1 incorrect letter we know? We also know that the letters used so far: \n- First guess: C,R,A,N,E -> C,A,N excluded, R and E present.\n- Second guess: S,T,O,R,E -> T excluded, S,O,R,E correct.\n\nWe don\'t know about other letters? We need to test the second position to see if it\'s present? But we have no previous info.\n\nTherefore, we can guess one of the candidate words? \n\nBut note: the risk? If we guess SHORE and it\'s not right, then we waste a turn? However, we have 4 tries left? And there are about 3-4 candidates? \n\nAlternatively, we could guess a word that tests several possible letters? But that might not be possible because the positions are fixed? We have to fill position2? \n\nBut note: we can use the previous incorrect letters? \n\nWe could guess a word that includes several candidate letters? But the word must have the pattern S?ORE? But we can\'t change the pattern? Because then we break the known positions? \n\nUnless we are testing to see if the pattern is correct? Actually, we have multiple (✓) for S,O,R,E so they are fixed? So the word can only be changed in the second letter?\n\nTherefore, we must guess a word that has S in position1, O in position3, R in position4, E in position5, and an unknown letter in position2? \n\nTherefore, the guess will necessarily be one of the candidate words: SHORE, SPORE, SWORE, or others? \n\nBut let\'s list: \n- H: we haven\'t tested H? So if we guess SHORE:\n   - Similarly, SPORE: test P?\n   - SWORE: test W?\n\nBut note: we also have the possibility that there might be other letters? For example, if the second letter is a letter we haven\'t thought of? \n\nBut we can test by guessing one? \n\nSince we have multiple candidates, we should pick one? \n\nLet me consider frequency: \n- H is more common than W? \n- SHORE is a very common word? \n\nHowever, to maximize information? But we cannot test multiple at once? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that might reveal the second letter? But we are forced to put a letter at position2? \n\nTherefore, we guess SHORE first? \n\nBut note: if SHORE is wrong, we learn that H is not present? Then we can try SPORE? And if SPORE is wrong? Then SWORE? \n\nBut we don\'t know how many possibilities? \n\nHowever, in Wordle, the goal is to guess the word? So we can try one? \n\nBut we have 4 tries? So even if we are wrong once? We can still guess?\n\nBut to be efficient? Since we are in the third guess? \n\nAlternatively, we can think: are there any other constraints? \n\nFrom previous feedback? We haven\'t checked? \n\nBut note: the first guess: crane had R marked as present in the wrong position? At position2? We now know that R is now at position4? So at the time of the first guess, R was present but not at position2? Its position was not known? Now we know it\'s at position4? \n\nBut the word did not have any other R? Because we now have it at position4. \n\nTherefore, the secret word doesn\'t have a second R? \n\nAlso, with the structure S?ORE, if we use SHORE, and the word is actually SPORE, then we get information that H is absent? \n\nTherefore, let us choose SHORE as a guess? \n\nBut note: SPORE has P? Which is common? And SHORE? \n\nI think SHORE is reasonable? \n\nBut let me see: perhaps we can use a word that doesn\'t repeat letters? \n\nAnother candidate: SABRE? But then we break the pattern? Because O and R would not be in position? \n\nWe cannot break the pattern? We have to put O at position3 and R at position4? \n\nSo we must use one of the ? in position2? \n\nTherefore, we pick ""SHORE"" as the next guess? \n\nBut note: SHORE? That is S, H, O, R, E. \n\nIf we guess SHORE, the feedback will tell us: \n- Position1: S? already known? So will be ✓\n- Position2: H? if correct then marked ✓? Otherwise, if H is present but in wrong position? But there\'s no other position? Since the word has fixed letters? Or if H is not in the word, marked x? \n- Similarly, O, R, E will be ✓ because fixed? \n\nThis gives us immediately: if position2 is H? Then we get all ✓. Otherwise, if H is wrong, we get S(✓) H(?) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)? And we know H was tested? \n\nBut if the word is SPORE, and we guess SHORE, then H will be marked either:\n- If H is in the word? Then (-)? But would it be? Because SPORE does not have H? So H(x)? \n- Then we know that position2 is not H? \n\nSimilarly, we can try SPORE next? \n\nBut perhaps we can choose a word that tests two possibilities? But that\'s not possible? \n\nAlternatively, we can choose a different word? Not fitting the pattern? For example, ""SHIRE""? But that has I? And E at position5? But then position3: I? But we know position3 is O? So SHIRE would mean that I is at position3? But we know that position3 is O? So SHIRE cannot be? \n\nTherefore, we must stick with S?ORE? \n\nThus, I choose ""SHORE"" for the next guess? \n\nBut let me consider: SWORE is also common? \n\nBut why not? \n\nI think SHORE is a good candidate? \n\nAlternatively, SPORE? \n\nBut let me see frequency? Common words: SHORE is more common? \n\nPerhaps we can consider: the word must be a common five-letter word? \n\nGiven that, I\'ll pick SHORE? \n\nSo guess: ""shore""\n\nBut note: we must avoid excluded letters? \nIn SHORE: H is not excluded? So okay?### Analysis of Previous Feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  \n  - E(✓) at position 5 → Secret word ends with **E**.  \n  - R(-) at position 2 → **R** is in the word, but not at position 2.  \n  - C(x), A(x), N(x) → **C**, **A**, **N** are absent.  \n- **Guess 2 (store)**:  \n  - S(✓) at position 1 → Secret word starts with **S**.  \n  - O(✓) at position 3 → Position 3 is **O**.  \n  - R(✓) at position 4 → Position 4 is **R**.  \n  - E(✓) at position 5 (confirms prior).  \n  - T(x) → **T** is absent.  \n\n### Deductions:\n- The secret word has the structure: **S _ O R E** (unknown at position 2).  \n- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, T.  \n- **Confirmed letters**: S (position 1), O (position 3), R (position 4), E (position 5).  \n- **Position constraints for R**: Initially ruled out position 2 (from Guess 1), now confirmed at position 4 (from Guess 2).  \n\n### Strategy:\n- Only position 2 remains unknown, so focus on finding the missing letter.  \n- Candidates for position 2 include:  \n  - Common English words: **SHORE**, **SPORE**, **SWORE**, etc.  \n  - Exclude improbable options:  \n    - **SCORE** (C excluded), **SNORE** (N excluded).  \n- Prioritize **SHORE**:  \n  - Tests **H**, a frequent consonant not yet evaluated.  \n  - Highly probable word due to commonality.  \n- If incorrect, feedback will confirm/reject **H** and reduce candidates (e.g., **SPORE** or **SWORE** next).\n\n<guess>shore</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)\nGuess 2: store -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\nGuess 3: shore -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given the feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- E is at position 5 and correct.
- R is present in the word but not at position 2 (where it was guessed).
- C, A, N are absent.

Guess 2: store -> S(✓) T(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- S is at position 1 and correct.
- O is at position 3 and correct.
- R is at position 4 and correct (which matches the R from guess 1).
- E at position 5 is correct (already known).
- T is absent.

Guess 3: shore -> S(✓) H(x) O(✓) R(✓) E(✓)
Interpretation:
- S, O, R, E are all in their correct positions (as confirmed).
- H is absent.

Therefore, the secret word is S _ O R E, where the blank is the second letter.

We know the word has exactly these five letters: S at 1, unknown at 2, O at 3, R at 4, E at 5.

The missing letter in position 2 must be a letter that:
- Is not excluded: C, A, N, T, H (now excluded because H(x) in guess 3).
- And must form a valid English word.

From the previous deductions, the candidates were SHORE, SPORE, SWORE, etc.

But now:
- SHORE was guessed and produced H(x), so H is not present. Therefore, SHORE is ruled out.
- Remaining candidates: SPORE, SWORE, and other valid words with the pattern S?ORE.

Common words:
- SPORE: using P? P has not been tested and is not excluded.
- SWORE: using W? W has not been tested and is not excluded.
- Other possibilities: SLOVE? No, because position 3 must be O. STORE? But T is excluded. Other rare words might exist, but we'll focus on common ones.

So the most common options are SPORE and SWORE.

We need to choose one? 

Strategy: 
- We have 3 tries left (after 3 guesses)? Actually, we have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 more.
- Guessing SPORE: 
  - If correct, we win.
  - If not, and we get P(x), then we know P is absent, and we can guess SWORE next? 
- Similarly, if we guess SWORE and it's incorrect, we learn about W.

But note: could there be other possibilities? 
- For example: ""SOREE"" (with double E?) but we have E at the end and no other E? And pattern S?ORE? Actually, SOREE would not be S?ORE? The pattern is fixed: second letter unknown, then O, R, E.

Alternatively, ""SOARE"" (old word for hawk) but not common. Wordle typically uses common words? 

Another word: ""SCORE"" is excluded because C is excluded? Similarly, ""SNORE"" excluded.

Perhaps ""STORE"" was already tried and T excluded? 

So we are left with SPORE and SWORE? 

But note: SWORE? That's the past tense of swear? Yes. SPORE is a biological term? 

We can choose SPORE? 

But let me consider letter frequency? P is more common than W? Not necessarily? 

To minimize risk? There are only two realistic candidates? 

We can guess SPORE? And if it's not correct, then we guess SWORE? 

Alternatively, we can use a guess that tests multiple possibilities? But how? The word must be of the pattern S?ORE? And we can only test one letter per guess? 

Therefore, I'll choose SPORE? But let's be systematic: 

If we guess ""spore"", then the feedback will be:
- S(✓) (position 1)
- P(?) (position 2) -> if P is correct, it will be ✓. Otherwise, if absent, x? Then O, R, E will be ✓. 

If P is correct, the word is SPORE? 

If not, then we know P is absent, so the word must be SWORE? 

Therefore, we can guess SPORE? 

But note: SWORE? What if the word is not SPORE? It could be SWORE? And then after SPORE fails, we guess SWORE? 

We have tries? So it's acceptable? 

But in Wordle, sometimes there might be multiple answers? But probably not? 

Therefore, we guess ""spore""? 

Actually, let's see: the structure S?ORE? The candidates are limited? 

We could also consider ""SKORE"" (variant of score) but K not excluded? However, SKORE is not common? 

Similarly, ""SMORE"" (not common)? 

Sticking to common words, we stick with SPORE and SWORE? 

Therefore, I choose SPORE? 

But note: SWORE? We haven't tested W? So we don't know? 

So, let's go with SPORE? 

The guessed word: spore

<guess>spore</guess>

In the response format? 

But note: the previous feedback? 

After guessing SHORE we had H(x), so we know H is not the second letter? 

Now we are guessing P? 

If I guess SPORE? Yes. 

Final decision.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback:
- **Guess 1 (crane)**:  
  E(✓) → Secret word ends with **E**.  
  R(-) → **R** exists in the word, but not position 2.  
  C/A/N(x) → Absent.  
- **Guess 2 (store)**:  
  S(✓)/O(✓)/R(✓)/E(✓) → Positions 1, 3, 4, 5 confirmed as **S**, **O**, **R**, **E**.  
  T(x) → Absent.  
- **Guess 3 (shore)**:  
  S(✓)/O(✓)/R(✓)/E(✓) → Confirms fixed positions again.  
  H(x) → **H** absent.  

### Deductions:

- **Excluded letters**: C, A, N, T, H (all marked ""x"" in prior feedback).  
- **Position 2 candidates**:  
  - Must form a valid English word with ""S?ORE"".  
  - Common options: **S P O R E** (spore) or **S W O R E** (swore).  
  - Ruled out:  
    - SHORE (H excluded)  
    - SCORE (C excluded)  
    - SNORE (N excluded)  
    - STORE (T excluded)  

### Strategy:
- Prioritize **SPORE**:  
  - Tests **P** (high-frequency consonant) for position 2.  
  - If correct → Solved. If incorrect → Position 2 must be **W** (SWORE).  
- Optimizes remaining guesses (3 tries left).
