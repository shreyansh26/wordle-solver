We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has:
   - Common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) to maximize information.
   - Avoid repeating letters to cover more distinct letters.

 Some effective starting words in Wordle are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose one that includes two vowels and three consonants, and avoid rare letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.

I'm starting the game and need my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starter words include common vowels (like A and E) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T). Words like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""ROAST"" work well. I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it covers three consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), helping identify multiple potential matches.

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Since A was in position 3 and N in position 4, they cannot be in those positions in the secret word.
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We must avoid using C, R, E in our next guess.

We also know that A and N are present, so our next guess must include A and N, but not in the 3rd and 4th positions respectively.

We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that uses common letters and avoids the excluded ones (C, R, E) and also avoids putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

We can also consider that the word might have other common letters. Since we have two known letters (A and N), we can try to use them in different positions and also introduce new common letters to test.

Possible positions for A: it cannot be in position 3. So it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
Similarly, N cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We should also avoid using the same positions for A and N as in the first guess because we know they are wrong.

We can look for words that have A and N, and also include other common letters (like S, T, L, I, O, D, H, etc.) but avoid C, R, E.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and are 5 letters.

We can try to put A in position 1 and N in position 2? But we don't know. We need to test.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A and N in positions that we haven't tried and also include other letters we haven't tested.

We have not tested the letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters in English: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Let's try to form a word that includes A and N and three new common letters.

Possible words:

- ""saint"": S, A, I, N, T -> but A is in position 2 and N in position 4? Wait, let's break it:
  S (1), A (2), I (3), N (4), T (5)
  However, in the feedback, we know that A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and that was wrong. But in this word, A is in position 2, which is allowed. Similarly, N was in position 4 in the first guess and that was wrong, but in this word, N is in position 4 again? That would be the same position as before, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put N in position 4.

Therefore, we must avoid putting N in position 4. So ""saint"" is invalid because N is in position 4.

We need a word where N is not in position 4 and A is not in position 3.

Another word: ""stand"" -> S, T, A, N, D
Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5)
But A is in position 3? We know from feedback that A cannot be in position 3. So that's invalid.

Another word: ""tansy"" (a plant) -> T, A, N, S, Y
Positions: T(1), A(2), N(3), S(4), Y(5)
This avoids position 3 for A (A is in 2) and position 4 for N (N is in 3). So that's acceptable.

But we are not sure if ""tansy"" is common. We can try more common words.

Another word: ""plain"" -> P, L, A, I, N
Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)
But A is in position 3? That's the same as the first guess and we know it's wrong. So invalid.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

How about ""panel""? But E is excluded, so we cannot use E.

We cannot use E.

Another word: ""manic"" -> M, A, N, I, C -> but C is excluded. So no.

We must avoid C, R, E.

Another word: ""sandy"" -> S, A, N, D, Y
Positions: S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5)
This is good because A is in 2 (not 3) and N is in 3 (not 4). Also, we are testing S, A, N, D, Y.

But we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""sandy"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""handy"": H, A, N, D, Y -> A in position 2, N in position 3. Also valid.

We can also consider ""latin"" but L, A, T, I, N -> A in position 2, N in position 5. That's acceptable because N is not in 4. But we have to check the positions: 
Position 1: L (new)
Position 2: A (allowed)
Position 3: T (new)
Position 4: I (new)
Position 5: N (allowed, since previously N was in 4 and that was wrong, but 5 is new)

So ""latin"" is acceptable.

But we are testing more letters with ""latin"": L, T, I, and we already know A and N.

We can also consider ""piano"", but that has O and is 5 letters? P-I-A-N-O -> but that has O, and we haven't tested O. However, we are limited by the known letters.

But note: we are trying to find the secret word, and we know it has A and N. We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""stain"" -> S, T, A, I, N -> but A is in position 3? That's not allowed. So no.

""train"" has R and we know R is excluded.

""plain"" has A in position 3 and we cannot use that.

How about ""adorn""? But that's 5 letters? A, D, O, R, N -> but R is excluded, so no.

We must avoid R.

Another word: ""daunt"" -> D, A, U, N, T -> positions: D(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), T(5)
But N is in position 4? We know that N cannot be in position 4 because in the first guess it was in 4 and was wrong. So we cannot use N in position 4. Therefore, ""daunt"" is invalid.

We need to avoid putting N in position 4.

Let me try to list words that have A and N, and avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible words:

- ""sandy"": S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> N is in 3, which is new. A is in 2, which is new.
- ""handy"": H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> same as above but with H.
- ""latin"": L(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), N(5) -> A in 2, N in 5 (new positions).
- ""mania"": M(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. Also, we are testing M, A, N, I. But A is in 2 and 5? We know A is at least once in the word, but maybe twice? We don't have information. However, we are allowed to guess duplicate letters. But in this case, we are testing only 4 distinct letters: M, A, N, I. And we are using A twice.

But we don't know if the word has two A's. It might be inefficient.

Another word: ""paint"" -> P, A, I, N, T -> positions: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but N is in position 4? That's not allowed. So invalid.

""taint"": T, A, I, N, T -> A in position 2, N in position 4 -> invalid because of N in 4.

""nasty"": N, A, S, T, Y -> positions: N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). This is acceptable because A is in 2 (not 3) and N is in 1 (not 4). So we can use ""nasty"".

But note: we are putting N in position 1, which we haven't tried before. And A in 2.

We can also consider ""salsa"" but that has two S's and no N? We need to include N.

We must include both A and N.

After considering, I think ""latin"" is a good choice because it tests L, T, I and places A and N in new positions.

But let's see the feedback we got: we have A and N in the word, so we are trying to find their correct positions and also discover other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A and N in the same positions as before and uses common letters.

I'll go with ""latin"": 
  L (new), A (in word but not in position 3, so we put in 2), T (new), I (new), N (in word but not in position 4, so we put in 5).

This way, we test three new letters and the positions for A and N.

So my next guess is ""latin"".

But note: we are not forced to use both known letters. However, we know the word has A and N, so if we don't include them, we might waste a guess. It's better to include them to get more information about their positions.

Therefore, I choose ""latin"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A and N **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - A cannot be in position 3 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").
  - N cannot be in position 4 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **N** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A in position 3 or N in position 4.
- Must **avoid** using C, R, or E.
- Should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, I, D, O) to maximize information.

After evaluating options, ""latin"" is a strong choice:
- **L** (new), **A** (in position 2, avoiding position 3), **T** (new), **I** (new), **N** (in position 5, avoiding position 4).
- Tests three new common letters (L, T, I) while respecting the known constraints for A and N.

But note: we are not forced to use both known letters. However, we know the word has A and N, so if we don't include them, we might waste a guess. It's better to include them to get more information about their positions.

Therefore, I choose ""latin"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A and N **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - A cannot be in position 3 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").
  - N cannot be in position 4 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **N** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A in position 3 or N in position 4.
- Must **avoid** using C, R, or E.
- Should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, I, D, O) to maximize information.

After evaluating options, ""latin"" is a strong choice:
- **L** (new), **A** (in position 2, avoiding position 3), **T** (new), **I** (new), **N** (in position 5, avoiding position 4).
- Tests three new common letters (L, T, I) while respecting the known constraints for A and N.",Guess 2: latin -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(x) I(-) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,AXION,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has:
   - Common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) to maximize information.
   - Avoid repeating letters to cover more distinct letters.

 Some effective starting words in Wordle are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose one that includes two vowels and three consonants, and avoid rare letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.I'm starting the game and need my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starter words include common vowels (like A and E) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T). Words like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""ROAST"" work well. I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it covers three consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), helping identify multiple potential matches.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Since A was in position 3 and N in position 4, they cannot be in those positions in the secret word.
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We must avoid using C, R, E in our next guess.

We also know that A and N are present, so our next guess must include A and N, but not in the 3rd and 4th positions respectively.

We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that uses common letters and avoids the excluded ones (C, R, E) and also avoids putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

We can also consider that the word might have other common letters. Since we have two known letters (A and N), we can try to use them in different positions and also introduce new common letters to test.

Possible positions for A: it cannot be in position 3. So it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
Similarly, N cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We should also avoid using the same positions for A and N as in the first guess because we know they are wrong.

We can look for words that have A and N, and also include other common letters (like S, T, L, I, O, D, H, etc.) but avoid C, R, E.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and are 5 letters.

We can try to put A in position 1 and N in position 2? But we don't know. We need to test.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A and N in positions that we haven't tried and also include other letters we haven't tested.

We have not tested the letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters in English: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Let's try to form a word that includes A and N and three new common letters.

Possible words:

- ""saint"": S, A, I, N, T -> but A is in position 2 and N in position 4? Wait, let's break it:
  S (1), A (2), I (3), N (4), T (5)
  However, in the feedback, we know that A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and that was wrong. But in this word, A is in position 2, which is allowed. Similarly, N was in position 4 in the first guess and that was wrong, but in this word, N is in position 4 again? That would be the same position as before, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put N in position 4.

Therefore, we must avoid putting N in position 4. So ""saint"" is invalid because N is in position 4.

We need a word where N is not in position 4 and A is not in position 3.

Another word: ""stand"" -> S, T, A, N, D
Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5)
But A is in position 3? We know from feedback that A cannot be in position 3. So that's invalid.

Another word: ""tansy"" (a plant) -> T, A, N, S, Y
Positions: T(1), A(2), N(3), S(4), Y(5)
This avoids position 3 for A (A is in 2) and position 4 for N (N is in 3). So that's acceptable.

But we are not sure if ""tansy"" is common. We can try more common words.

Another word: ""plain"" -> P, L, A, I, N
Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)
But A is in position 3? That's the same as the first guess and we know it's wrong. So invalid.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

How about ""panel""? But E is excluded, so we cannot use E.

We cannot use E.

Another word: ""manic"" -> M, A, N, I, C -> but C is excluded. So no.

We must avoid C, R, E.

Another word: ""sandy"" -> S, A, N, D, Y
Positions: S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5)
This is good because A is in 2 (not 3) and N is in 3 (not 4). Also, we are testing S, A, N, D, Y.

But we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""sandy"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""handy"": H, A, N, D, Y -> A in position 2, N in position 3. Also valid.

We can also consider ""latin"" but L, A, T, I, N -> A in position 2, N in position 5. That's acceptable because N is not in 4. But we have to check the positions: 
Position 1: L (new)
Position 2: A (allowed)
Position 3: T (new)
Position 4: I (new)
Position 5: N (allowed, since previously N was in 4 and that was wrong, but 5 is new)

So ""latin"" is acceptable.

But we are testing more letters with ""latin"": L, T, I, and we already know A and N.

We can also consider ""piano"", but that has O and is 5 letters? P-I-A-N-O -> but that has O, and we haven't tested O. However, we are limited by the known letters.

But note: we are trying to find the secret word, and we know it has A and N. We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""stain"" -> S, T, A, I, N -> but A is in position 3? That's not allowed. So no.

""train"" has R and we know R is excluded.

""plain"" has A in position 3 and we cannot use that.

How about ""adorn""? But that's 5 letters? A, D, O, R, N -> but R is excluded, so no.

We must avoid R.

Another word: ""daunt"" -> D, A, U, N, T -> positions: D(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), T(5)
But N is in position 4? We know that N cannot be in position 4 because in the first guess it was in 4 and was wrong. So we cannot use N in position 4. Therefore, ""daunt"" is invalid.

We need to avoid putting N in position 4.

Let me try to list words that have A and N, and avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible words:

- ""sandy"": S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> N is in 3, which is new. A is in 2, which is new.
- ""handy"": H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> same as above but with H.
- ""latin"": L(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), N(5) -> A in 2, N in 5 (new positions).
- ""mania"": M(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. Also, we are testing M, A, N, I. But A is in 2 and 5? We know A is at least once in the word, but maybe twice? We don't have information. However, we are allowed to guess duplicate letters. But in this case, we are testing only 4 distinct letters: M, A, N, I. And we are using A twice.

But we don't know if the word has two A's. It might be inefficient.

Another word: ""paint"" -> P, A, I, N, T -> positions: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but N is in position 4? That's not allowed. So invalid.

""taint"": T, A, I, N, T -> A in position 2, N in position 4 -> invalid because of N in 4.

""nasty"": N, A, S, T, Y -> positions: N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). This is acceptable because A is in 2 (not 3) and N is in 1 (not 4). So we can use ""nasty"".

But note: we are putting N in position 1, which we haven't tried before. And A in 2.

We can also consider ""salsa"" but that has two S's and no N? We need to include N.

We must include both A and N.

After considering, I think ""latin"" is a good choice because it tests L, T, I and places A and N in new positions.

But let's see the feedback we got: we have A and N in the word, so we are trying to find their correct positions and also discover other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A and N in the same positions as before and uses common letters.

I'll go with ""latin"": 
  L (new), A (in word but not in position 3, so we put in 2), T (new), I (new), N (in word but not in position 4, so we put in 5).

This way, we test three new letters and the positions for A and N.

So my next guess is ""latin"".

But note: we are not forced to use both known letters. However, we know the word has A and N, so if we don't include them, we might waste a guess. It's better to include them to get more information about their positions.

Therefore, I choose ""latin"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A and N **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - A cannot be in position 3 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").
  - N cannot be in position 4 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **N** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A in position 3 or N in position 4.
- Must **avoid** using C, R, or E.
- Should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, I, D, O) to maximize information.

- Tests three new common letters (L, T, I) while respecting the known constraints for A and N.

We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess ""crane"":
   - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
   → So, letters C, R, E are not in the secret word.
   → A and N are in the word but in wrong positions. Specifically, A was in position 3 and N in position 4 of ""crane"", so the secret word has A but not in position 3, and N but not in position 4.

2. Guess ""latin"":
   - L(x), A(-), T(x), I(-), N(✓)
   → L and T are not in the word (since x).
   → A is in the word but not in position 2 (since it showed as '-' for position 2 in ""latin"").
   → I is in the word but not in position 4 (since '-' for position 4).
   → N is correct in position 5 (since ✓). So the secret word has N as the fifth letter.

   - A is in the word, but not at position 2 (and also not at position 3, from previous guess).
   - I is in the word, but not at position 4.

Also, we know the secret word has A, I, and N (from the two feedbacks). And N is fixed at position 5.

Now, let's consolidate known information:
- Position 5: N (fixed)
- Excluded letters: C, R, E, L, T (from both guesses, all marked x)
- Present letters (must be in the word): A, I, and of course N (but N is already placed).
- A cannot be in position 2 or 3.
- I cannot be in position 4.

Since N is at position 5, the word is _ _ _ _ N.

We have two more letters to discover (since the word is 5 letters and we only know A and I are in it, but there are two more we haven't found because we only have A, I, N so far, and we need five letters).

We know the word contains A, I, and N. Since we have three confirmed letters (A, I, N) and the word is five letters, there are two more letters we haven't identified yet.

We have tested the following letters: C, R, A, N, E (first guess) and L, A, T, I, N (second guess). So the letters we have tested and are excluded: C, R, E, L, T.

We need to choose a word that:
1. Has N at the end (position 5).
2. Contains A and I (and two other letters we haven't tried).
3. A is not in position 2 or 3 (and also not in position 5 because that's N). So A can only be in position 1 or 4? The positions in the word: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 5 is taken by N. So A can be in position 1 or 4? But note: from ""latin"", A was in position 2 (and was wrong) and from ""crane"" in position 3 (wrong). So A cannot be in 2 or 3. Position 5 is N, so indeed A can only be in position 1 or 4.

Similarly, I is not in position 4? Wait, in ""latin"", I was in position 4 and it was marked '-', meaning it is present but not in that position. So I cannot be in position 4. Also, we don't know about other positions. So I can be in 1,2, or 3? But position 5 is N.

So:
- Position for A: only 1 or 4.
- Position for I: only 1,2,3 (but 5 is taken).

Now, if A is in position 1, that leaves I in position 2 or 3? Or if A is in position 4, then I can be in 1,2,3.

We also have two other letters to include.

We need to avoid the excluded letters: C, E, R, L, T.

We should use common letters not tried: for example, S, O, D, M, P, U, B, etc.

Let me try to think of words ending in N and containing A and I.

First, if A is in position 1: then we have A _ _ _ N. And the word must contain I and two other letters.

Possible words: 
- ""ADMIN"" but D, M are new? But ""admin"" is a common word. However, we have to check: 
  - A at 1? Allowed.
  - I: must be in the word, and in ""admin"", I is at position 4? But wait, position 4: I? But we cannot put I in position 4 because feedback says it's not in that position? Wait, in ""latin"", I was in position 4 and it was marked '-', meaning I is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put I in position 4 in a new word, it would be incorrect? Actually, no: the secret word cannot have I in position 4. So in ""admin"", if we try it, and I is in position 4, that would contradict because we know I cannot be at position 4.

Therefore, ""admin"" is invalid because it has I at position 4, which is disallowed.

Similarly, other words: e.g., ""AKING"" is not a word.

""AVAIL"" but ends with L and L is excluded? Also L is excluded, so we cannot use L.

How about ""ASIAN""? Let's check:
  A in position 1? Allowed.
  I: must be in the word. In ""asian"", I is in position 4? Again position 4, which is disallowed. So invalid.

Position for I must be 1,2,3 only. Since position 5 is N and position 4 cannot hold I.

Therefore, if A is in 1 and I in 2 or 3.

For example, ""ALIEN"" but E is excluded and L excluded? And it has E? E is not allowed.

We must avoid E.

Another possibility: ""AMINO"" but O? ""amino"" is a word. But:
  A at position 1? Allowed.
  I: at position 3? That's allowed because position 3 is okay for I? (Yes, since we only know it can't be in position 4).
  But the word ends with O, not N? ""amino"" ends with O? We need to end with N. So not.

Now, other pattern: A in position 4? Then the word is _ _ _ A N.

And I must be in one of positions 1,2,3.

So the word would be _ _ _ A N.

And I can be at 1,2, or 3.

Also, we have two other letters.

Common words: e.g., ""URBAN"" but U and B? But avoids exclusions? 
  U(1), R? R is excluded. So cannot use R.

""Human""? H, U, M, A, N -> but M is allowed? However, U? But E is excluded, R is excluded, but R not here. However, ""human"" has H, U, M, A, N. R is not used, but wait: in first guess R is excluded so we cannot use R? Actually, in ""urban"" we saw R excluded. So ""urban"" not allowed. For ""human"": no excluded letters? We excluded C, R, E, L, T. So H, U, M are new and okay.

But in ""human"", I is not present? The word must contain I? We know I must be in the word. ""human"" has H,U,M,A,N — no I. So we cannot guess that because I is missing.

We must include I.

So words ending with AN and containing I.

For example, ""urban"" has R excluded.

""ROBIN"" has R excluded.

""VIXEN"" has E and X? E excluded.

""CHAIR"" has R and C? Excluded.

A better idea: let's list common words ending with N and containing A and I, and avoid excluded letters.

Excluded: C, E, R, L, T

We can use: S, O, D, M, P, U, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:

- ""SABIN"" (like vaccine) - S,A,B,I,N → forms: S(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), N(5). But note: I is in position 4? We know I cannot be in position 4, because from ""latin"" feedback, I was in position 4 and marked '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put I in position 4. Thus, ""sabin"" would be invalid because it puts I in position 4.

- ""PAIN"" — that's 4 letters, we need 5.

Another: ""MAINS"" — but that ends with S? We need ending with N.

Perhaps ""KIWAN"" — not a valid word.

How about ""DEVIN""? But E excluded? E is excluded.

""BLIND"" — ends with D? Not N.

Perhaps ""BRAIN"" — has R, excluded.

""DAISY"" — ends with Y? Not N.

This is tricky.

Another pattern: A in position 4. So the word is ... A N at end. And I must be in position 1,2, or 3.

For example: a word like X X I A N -> positions: 1,2,3,4,5: N already set. So [1][2][3] A N.

And I at 1,2, or 3.

For instance, ""VIXEN"" -> V, I, X, E, N -> but E excluded and ends with N? X and E is excluded? E is excluded, so invalid.

""ANIM U"" — not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""OXBOW"" — no I and no A? And not ending with N.

Let's think: ""BASIN"" -> B, A, S, I, N -> but I is at position 4? Not allowed. 
Similarly, ""ROSIN"" has R excluded.

How about ""MAIDEN""? Too long.

5-letter? ""OCTAN"" not a common word.

Another: ""ADMIN"" we already saw has I in position 4? ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N → I is at position 4? Disallowed.

But we need I not in position 4.

So maybe I in position 2 or 3.

For example, with A at 4: 
- Position 1: put I? Then I(1), then position 2,3 are new letters, A(4), N(5). So I _ _ A N.

But can we have I at position 1? We don't know until we try.

For instance: ""IRAQ N"" not valid.

""ISL AN"" but L excluded and not a word.

""IMAGN"" not a word.

Maybe without I at 1? With I at position 2: for example, X I X A N.

And no excluded letters.

So for position 1, we can put S: ""S I T A N"" but T is excluded? T is marked x in second guess. So we cannot use T.

Similarly, D: ""D I V A N"" → DIVAN is a word? D(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), N(5). This might work. Avoiding excluded letters: D, V not excluded? Only C,E,R,L,T excluded.

So DIVAN: 
- D not tested, 
- I: in position 2? We have no information that I cannot be at position 2? We only know it cannot be at position 4. So position 2 is allowed.
- V new, 
- A in position 4: and we said A can be in position 4? Yes.
- N at 5.

So DIVAN could be a guess.

Similarly, ""P I C A N"" but C excluded? Or ""WICAN"" not a word.

Another word: ""W I D A N"" not a word.

""DIVAN"" seems valid.

But is ""divan"" common? It means a sofa.

We could try ""S I M A N"" but not a word? We have ""simian"" but that's 6 letters? Simian is 6? S-I-M-I-A-N, 6 letters.

No, 5-letter: SIMAN is not a valid word.

Other possibilities: ""B I D A N"" not a word.

""IVYAN"" not a word.

So ""divan"" is a possibility.

Another structure: A not in position 4, but in position 1? Earlier we considered.

Position 1: A, and then I at position 3? So A _ I _ N.

With position 2 and 4 are new.

Words: ""ALIGN"" but L excluded and G? L excluded.

""AXION"": A, X, I, O, N → positions: A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). This seems good. 
- A at position 1: allowed.
- I at position 3: we have no restriction against position 3 for I? Only position 4 is forbidden. 
- Avoids excluded letters? X, O not excluded? Only C,E,R,L,T excluded.

""Axion"" is a word (physics term).

So ""axion"" could be another guess.

We also have ""avion"" but that's French, usually ""avion"" is not English word? We need English word. ""Axion"" is English.

Similarly, ""PRION"" has R excluded.

""DENIM"" ends with M? Not N.

So possibilities: ""divan"" or ""axion"".

But ""axion"" tests more common letters? X is less common.

We can also consider ""admin"" but invalid because of I in position 4.

Another common word: ""RAIN"" has only 4.

We already have ""divan"" and ""axion"".

But let's see if there is a better word? We want to test common letters.

Letters not tested: S has not been tested? We haven't used S.

In first guess: crane had no S.
Second guess: latin had no S.

Similarly, O, D, M, P, U, B, G, H, Y, etc.

So perhaps we should include S to test.

Why not a word with S and O or something.

For example, with A in position 1 and I in position 3? We have A _ I _ N.

So positions: [1]=A, [3]=I, [5]=N, then [2] and [4] to fill.

We need to choose two letters. Avoid excluded C,E,R,L,T.

Possible: [2]=S, [4]=O? Then ""ASION""? But ""asion"" is not a word.

[2]=O, [4]=S: ""A O I S N"" → ""aoisn"" not a word.

[2]=M, [4]=S: ""AMIS N"" → ""amiss"" ends with SS? Not N.

N is at 5.

Another: [2]=D, [4]=O: ""ADION"" not a word.

""ADMIN"" becomes invalid.

Perhaps with A in position 4.

As before: _ _ _ A N, with I in one of the first three.

And including S.

For example: position 1=S, position 2=I, position 3=O, then ""S I O A N"" → ""sion a n""? Not a word.

Position 1=O, position 2=I, position 3=S: ""O I S A N"" → ""o is a n"" not a word.

Perhaps ""DAISY"" does not end with N.

But we have ""doing"" not end with N.

Another word: ""SPAIN"" has P, but I at position 4? ""spain"": S(1), P(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). 
But:
- A is at position 3? From first guess with ""crane"", A in position 3 was wrong. We cannot put A in position 3. So ""spain"" would have A in position 3, invalid.

Similarly, ""train"" has R.

""MAINS"" is M,A,I,N,S → ends with S? S is at position 5 but we need position 5=N.

So not.

Considering ""divan"" and ""axion"", both are valid and satisfy the constraints.

Alternatively, ""damn"" is 4 letters.

""Pagan"" ends with N? G,A,N → but pag a n? P A G A N -> that has two A's? And it ends with N? But we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? We don't have information against that.

""pagan"": P(1), A(2), G(3), A(4), N(5). But note: A is in position 2, which from ""latin"" we know A cannot be in position 2 (because in ""latin"" A was in position 2 and marked '-', meaning it is in the word but wrong position). So we cannot put A in position 2? Exactly.

In ""pagan"", A is in position 2: that is disallowed because we already tried A in position 2 and it was not correct.

Similarly, A is in position 4? Which is okay? But the word has two A's? Possibly? But position 4 for A is allowed because we haven't tried it? The only positions A cannot be are 2 and 3.

So ""Pagan"": 
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: A (not allowed because we know from guess 2 that position 2 has A and it was wrong)
- Position 3: G
- Position 4: A (allowed, because we haven't tried position 4 yet)
- Position 5: N

But in the word ""pagan"", position 2 also has A? However, the feedback would show for position 2: A in position 2 is disallowed? Specifically, we know from ""latin"" that when we put A in position 2, it was incorrect. Therefore, we cannot use that in a new word? Unless we are testing for duplicate: the word might have two A's? But position 2 cannot have A because we already know it's wrong.

So when we say 'disallowed', it means that in the secret word, position 2 is not A? Because it was tried and marked as wrong position. So the secret word does not have A in position 2.

Therefore, ""pagan"" would be invalid for guess because it puts A in position 2.

So we discard.

Back to ""divan"" or ""axion"".

Since we haven't tested S, perhaps we can look for a word that includes S and avoids positions.

For example, if A is in position 4, then we have _ _ _ A N.

And I in position 1,2, or 3.

With S? For example, ""USN IA N"" not a word.

"" MAS A N"" with I? e.g., ""MAJOR"" not ending with N.

Another common ending: ""woman"" W O M A N? Ends with N? That's a valid word: W(1), O(2), M(3), A(4), N(5). 
- And we have A at position 4: allowed.
- Does it have I? No, ""woman"" has no I? But we must include I? The secret word has I? From feedback: in ""latin"", I was marked in the word (since '-')? Yes, I is in the secret word. But ""woman"" has W,O,M,A,N — no I. So we cannot choose it.

Similarly, ""human"" no I.

So we must have a word with I.

Now, let's try to find words like ""vista n"" not.

Perhaps ""divan"" is the best choice? Or ""axion"".

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that has more common letters? ""divan"" has D, I, V, A, N; we know A and N, but D and V are new. And I is tested for position 2.

Similarly, ""axion"" has A, X, I, O, N; X is less common? But O is common.

Another idea: ""SHIN"" is 4 letters.

""Begin"" has G? ""begin"" B,E,G,I,N → but E excluded? E is excluded.

""piano"" not ending in N.

I think our best bets are ""divan"" or ""axion"". We can also consider ""diana"" but ends with A? Not with N.

Let's choose ""divan"": D, I, V, A, N → positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:V, 4:A, 5:N.

This satisfies:
- N at 5.
- A at position 4: which is allowed (A can be at 1 or 4).
- I at position 2: we have no restriction against position 2? Only that I cannot be at position 4? So position 2 is okay.
- Avoids excluded letters: no C,E,R,L,T.

So guess ""divan"".

Alternatively, to test more vowels? ""axion"" might be less common.

Another word: ""rabid"" not ending with N.

Perhaps ""koine"" but E excluded.

So I'll go with ""divan"".
</think>
After reviewing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
  → This eliminates C, R, E as possible letters.  
  → Confirms A and N are in the secret word, but not in positions 3 or 4 (since A was guessed in position 3 and N in position 4, both marked wrong).
  
- **Guess 2: latin**  
  Feedback: L(x), A(-), T(x), I(-), N(✓)  
  → This eliminates L and T as possible letters.  
  → Confirms A is not in position 2 (as it was marked wrong here), and I is not in position 4 (marked wrong) but is present in the word.  
  → Confirms N is in position 5 (✓ in position 5).

**Consolidated Insights**:
- Secret word contains: **A**, **I**, and **N** (with **N** fixed at position 5).
- The word ends with **N** (position 5).
- **A** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from previous feedback).
- **I** cannot be in position 4 (from previous feedback).
- Excluded letters: **C, E, R, L, T**.
- Known letter positions:  
Position 5: **N** (confirmed).  
A must be in position 1 or 4 (only available options since positions 2/3 are invalid, and position 5 is taken by N).  
I must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (only options since position 4/5 are invalid/taken).  
- Need to identify two additional letters for the unknown positions (since only A, I, and N are confirmed).

For the next guess, the word **DIVAN** is chosen because it:  
- Includes **A** (in position 4, allowed) and **I** (in position 2, allowed).  
- Includes N at position 5 (confirmed).  
- Uses new common letters (**D** and **V**) not tested before.  
- Avoids all excluded letters (C, E, R, L, T).  
- Tests potential positions for A (position 4) and I (position 2).  
- Is a valid English word meaning a type of sofa or council chamber.  

This guess will help narrow down the possible letters and positions further.

<guess>divan</guess>",divan,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess ""crane"":
   - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
   → So, letters C, R, E are not in the secret word.
   → A and N are in the word but in wrong positions. Specifically, A was in position 3 and N in position 4 of ""crane"", so the secret word has A but not in position 3, and N but not in position 4.

2. Guess ""latin"":
   - L(x), A(-), T(x), I(-), N(✓)
   → L and T are not in the word (since x).
   → A is in the word but not in position 2 (since it showed as '-' for position 2 in ""latin"").
   → I is in the word but not in position 4 (since '-' for position 4).
   → N is correct in position 5 (since ✓). So the secret word has N as the fifth letter.

From guess 2, we know:
   - The secret word ends with N (position 5).
   - A is in the word, but not at position 2 (and also not at position 3, from previous guess).
   - I is in the word, but not at position 4.

Also, we know the secret word has A, I, and N (from the two feedbacks). And N is fixed at position 5.

Now, let's consolidate known information:
- Position 5: N (fixed)
- Excluded letters: C, R, E, L, T (from both guesses, all marked x)
- Present letters (must be in the word): A, I, and of course N (but N is already placed).
- A cannot be in position 2 or 3.
- I cannot be in position 4.

Since N is at position 5, the word is _ _ _ _ N.

We have two more letters to discover (since the word is 5 letters and we only know A and I are in it, but there are two more we haven't found because we only have A, I, N so far, and we need five letters).

We know the word contains A, I, and N. Since we have three confirmed letters (A, I, N) and the word is five letters, there are two more letters we haven't identified yet.

We have tested the following letters: C, R, A, N, E (first guess) and L, A, T, I, N (second guess). So the letters we have tested and are excluded: C, R, E, L, T.

We need to choose a word that:
1. Has N at the end (position 5).
2. Contains A and I (and two other letters we haven't tried).
3. A is not in position 2 or 3 (and also not in position 5 because that's N). So A can only be in position 1 or 4? The positions in the word: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 5 is taken by N. So A can be in position 1 or 4? But note: from ""latin"", A was in position 2 (and was wrong) and from ""crane"" in position 3 (wrong). So A cannot be in 2 or 3. Position 5 is N, so indeed A can only be in position 1 or 4.

Similarly, I is not in position 4? Wait, in ""latin"", I was in position 4 and it was marked '-', meaning it is present but not in that position. So I cannot be in position 4. Also, we don't know about other positions. So I can be in 1,2, or 3? But position 5 is N.

So:
- Position for A: only 1 or 4.
- Position for I: only 1,2,3 (but 5 is taken).

Now, if A is in position 1, that leaves I in position 2 or 3? Or if A is in position 4, then I can be in 1,2,3.

We also have two other letters to include.

We need to avoid the excluded letters: C, E, R, L, T.

We should use common letters not tried: for example, S, O, D, M, P, U, B, etc.

Let me try to think of words ending in N and containing A and I.

First, if A is in position 1: then we have A _ _ _ N. And the word must contain I and two other letters.

Possible words: 
- ""ADMIN"" but D, M are new? But ""admin"" is a common word. However, we have to check: 
  - A at 1? Allowed.
  - I: must be in the word, and in ""admin"", I is at position 4? But wait, position 4: I? But we cannot put I in position 4 because feedback says it's not in that position? Wait, in ""latin"", I was in position 4 and it was marked '-', meaning I is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put I in position 4 in a new word, it would be incorrect? Actually, no: the secret word cannot have I in position 4. So in ""admin"", if we try it, and I is in position 4, that would contradict because we know I cannot be at position 4.

Therefore, ""admin"" is invalid because it has I at position 4, which is disallowed.

Similarly, other words: e.g., ""AKING"" is not a word.

""AVAIL"" but ends with L and L is excluded? Also L is excluded, so we cannot use L.

How about ""ASIAN""? Let's check:
  A in position 1? Allowed.
  I: must be in the word. In ""asian"", I is in position 4? Again position 4, which is disallowed. So invalid.

Position for I must be 1,2,3 only. Since position 5 is N and position 4 cannot hold I.

Therefore, if A is in 1 and I in 2 or 3.

For example, ""ALIEN"" but E is excluded and L excluded? And it has E? E is not allowed.

We must avoid E.

Another possibility: ""AMINO"" but O? ""amino"" is a word. But:
  A at position 1? Allowed.
  I: at position 3? That's allowed because position 3 is okay for I? (Yes, since we only know it can't be in position 4).
  But the word ends with O, not N? ""amino"" ends with O? We need to end with N. So not.

Now, other pattern: A in position 4? Then the word is _ _ _ A N.

And I must be in one of positions 1,2,3.

So the word would be _ _ _ A N.

And I can be at 1,2, or 3.

Also, we have two other letters.

Common words: e.g., ""URBAN"" but U and B? But avoids exclusions? 
  U(1), R? R is excluded. So cannot use R.

""Human""? H, U, M, A, N -> but M is allowed? However, U? But E is excluded, R is excluded, but R not here. However, ""human"" has H, U, M, A, N. R is not used, but wait: in first guess R is excluded so we cannot use R? Actually, in ""urban"" we saw R excluded. So ""urban"" not allowed. For ""human"": no excluded letters? We excluded C, R, E, L, T. So H, U, M are new and okay.

But in ""human"", I is not present? The word must contain I? We know I must be in the word. ""human"" has H,U,M,A,N — no I. So we cannot guess that because I is missing.

We must include I.

So words ending with AN and containing I.

For example, ""urban"" has R excluded.

""ROBIN"" has R excluded.

""VIXEN"" has E and X? E excluded.

""CHAIR"" has R and C? Excluded.

A better idea: let's list common words ending with N and containing A and I, and avoid excluded letters.

Excluded: C, E, R, L, T

We can use: S, O, D, M, P, U, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:

- ""SABIN"" (like vaccine) - S,A,B,I,N → forms: S(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), N(5). But note: I is in position 4? We know I cannot be in position 4, because from ""latin"" feedback, I was in position 4 and marked '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put I in position 4. Thus, ""sabin"" would be invalid because it puts I in position 4.

- ""PAIN"" — that's 4 letters, we need 5.

Another: ""MAINS"" — but that ends with S? We need ending with N.

Perhaps ""KIWAN"" — not a valid word.

How about ""DEVIN""? But E excluded? E is excluded.

""BLIND"" — ends with D? Not N.

Perhaps ""BRAIN"" — has R, excluded.

""DAISY"" — ends with Y? Not N.

This is tricky.

Another pattern: A in position 4. So the word is ... A N at end. And I must be in position 1,2, or 3.

For example: a word like X X I A N -> positions: 1,2,3,4,5: N already set. So [1][2][3] A N.

And I at 1,2, or 3.

For instance, ""VIXEN"" -> V, I, X, E, N -> but E excluded and ends with N? X and E is excluded? E is excluded, so invalid.

""ANIM U"" — not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""OXBOW"" — no I and no A? And not ending with N.

Let's think: ""BASIN"" -> B, A, S, I, N -> but I is at position 4? Not allowed. 
Similarly, ""ROSIN"" has R excluded.

How about ""MAIDEN""? Too long.

5-letter? ""OCTAN"" not a common word.

Another: ""ADMIN"" we already saw has I in position 4? ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N → I is at position 4? Disallowed.

But we need I not in position 4.

So maybe I in position 2 or 3.

For example, with A at 4: 
- Position 1: put I? Then I(1), then position 2,3 are new letters, A(4), N(5). So I _ _ A N.

But can we have I at position 1? We don't know until we try.

For instance: ""IRAQ N"" not valid.

""ISL AN"" but L excluded and not a word.

""IMAGN"" not a word.

Maybe without I at 1? With I at position 2: for example, X I X A N.

And no excluded letters.

So for position 1, we can put S: ""S I T A N"" but T is excluded? T is marked x in second guess. So we cannot use T.

Similarly, D: ""D I V A N"" → DIVAN is a word? D(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), N(5). This might work. Avoiding excluded letters: D, V not excluded? Only C,E,R,L,T excluded.

So DIVAN: 
- D not tested, 
- I: in position 2? We have no information that I cannot be at position 2? We only know it cannot be at position 4. So position 2 is allowed.
- V new, 
- A in position 4: and we said A can be in position 4? Yes.
- N at 5.

So DIVAN could be a guess.

Similarly, ""P I C A N"" but C excluded? Or ""WICAN"" not a word.

Another word: ""W I D A N"" not a word.

""DIVAN"" seems valid.

But is ""divan"" common? It means a sofa.

We could try ""S I M A N"" but not a word? We have ""simian"" but that's 6 letters? Simian is 6? S-I-M-I-A-N, 6 letters.

No, 5-letter: SIMAN is not a valid word.

Other possibilities: ""B I D A N"" not a word.

""IVYAN"" not a word.

So ""divan"" is a possibility.

Another structure: A not in position 4, but in position 1? Earlier we considered.

Position 1: A, and then I at position 3? So A _ I _ N.

With position 2 and 4 are new.

Words: ""ALIGN"" but L excluded and G? L excluded.

""AXION"": A, X, I, O, N → positions: A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). This seems good. 
- A at position 1: allowed.
- I at position 3: we have no restriction against position 3 for I? Only position 4 is forbidden. 
- Avoids excluded letters? X, O not excluded? Only C,E,R,L,T excluded.

""Axion"" is a word (physics term).

So ""axion"" could be another guess.

We also have ""avion"" but that's French, usually ""avion"" is not English word? We need English word. ""Axion"" is English.

Similarly, ""PRION"" has R excluded.

""DENIM"" ends with M? Not N.

So possibilities: ""divan"" or ""axion"".

But ""axion"" tests more common letters? X is less common.

We can also consider ""admin"" but invalid because of I in position 4.

Another common word: ""RAIN"" has only 4.

We already have ""divan"" and ""axion"".

But let's see if there is a better word? We want to test common letters.

Letters not tested: S has not been tested? We haven't used S.

In first guess: crane had no S.
Second guess: latin had no S.

Similarly, O, D, M, P, U, B, G, H, Y, etc.

So perhaps we should include S to test.

Why not a word with S and O or something.

For example, with A in position 1 and I in position 3? We have A _ I _ N.

So positions: [1]=A, [3]=I, [5]=N, then [2] and [4] to fill.

We need to choose two letters. Avoid excluded C,E,R,L,T.

Possible: [2]=S, [4]=O? Then ""ASION""? But ""asion"" is not a word.

[2]=O, [4]=S: ""A O I S N"" → ""aoisn"" not a word.

[2]=M, [4]=S: ""AMIS N"" → ""amiss"" ends with SS? Not N.

N is at 5.

Another: [2]=D, [4]=O: ""ADION"" not a word.

""ADMIN"" becomes invalid.

Perhaps with A in position 4.

As before: _ _ _ A N, with I in one of the first three.

And including S.

For example: position 1=S, position 2=I, position 3=O, then ""S I O A N"" → ""sion a n""? Not a word.

Position 1=O, position 2=I, position 3=S: ""O I S A N"" → ""o is a n"" not a word.

Perhaps ""DAISY"" does not end with N.

But we have ""doing"" not end with N.

Another word: ""SPAIN"" has P, but I at position 4? ""spain"": S(1), P(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). 
But:
- A is at position 3? From first guess with ""crane"", A in position 3 was wrong. We cannot put A in position 3. So ""spain"" would have A in position 3, invalid.

Similarly, ""train"" has R.

""MAINS"" is M,A,I,N,S → ends with S? S is at position 5 but we need position 5=N.

So not.

Considering ""divan"" and ""axion"", both are valid and satisfy the constraints.

Alternatively, ""damn"" is 4 letters.

""Pagan"" ends with N? G,A,N → but pag a n? P A G A N -> that has two A's? And it ends with N? But we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? We don't have information against that.

""pagan"": P(1), A(2), G(3), A(4), N(5). But note: A is in position 2, which from ""latin"" we know A cannot be in position 2 (because in ""latin"" A was in position 2 and marked '-', meaning it is in the word but wrong position). So we cannot put A in position 2? Exactly.

In ""pagan"", A is in position 2: that is disallowed because we already tried A in position 2 and it was not correct.

Similarly, A is in position 4? Which is okay? But the word has two A's? Possibly? But position 4 for A is allowed because we haven't tried it? The only positions A cannot be are 2 and 3.

So ""Pagan"": 
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: A (not allowed because we know from guess 2 that position 2 has A and it was wrong)
- Position 3: G
- Position 4: A (allowed, because we haven't tried position 4 yet)
- Position 5: N

But in the word ""pagan"", position 2 also has A? However, the feedback would show for position 2: A in position 2 is disallowed? Specifically, we know from ""latin"" that when we put A in position 2, it was incorrect. Therefore, we cannot use that in a new word? Unless we are testing for duplicate: the word might have two A's? But position 2 cannot have A because we already know it's wrong.

So when we say 'disallowed', it means that in the secret word, position 2 is not A? Because it was tried and marked as wrong position. So the secret word does not have A in position 2.

Therefore, ""pagan"" would be invalid for guess because it puts A in position 2.

So we discard.

Back to ""divan"" or ""axion"".

Since we haven't tested S, perhaps we can look for a word that includes S and avoids positions.

For example, if A is in position 4, then we have _ _ _ A N.

And I in position 1,2, or 3.

With S? For example, ""USN IA N"" not a word.

"" MAS A N"" with I? e.g., ""MAJOR"" not ending with N.

Another common ending: ""woman"" W O M A N? Ends with N? That's a valid word: W(1), O(2), M(3), A(4), N(5). 
- And we have A at position 4: allowed.
- Does it have I? No, ""woman"" has no I? But we must include I? The secret word has I? From feedback: in ""latin"", I was marked in the word (since '-')? Yes, I is in the secret word. But ""woman"" has W,O,M,A,N — no I. So we cannot choose it.

Similarly, ""human"" no I.

So we must have a word with I.

Now, let's try to find words like ""vista n"" not.

Perhaps ""divan"" is the best choice? Or ""axion"".

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that has more common letters? ""divan"" has D, I, V, A, N; we know A and N, but D and V are new. And I is tested for position 2.

Similarly, ""axion"" has A, X, I, O, N; X is less common? But O is common.

Another idea: ""SHIN"" is 4 letters.

""Begin"" has G? ""begin"" B,E,G,I,N → but E excluded? E is excluded.

""piano"" not ending in N.

I think our best bets are ""divan"" or ""axion"". We can also consider ""diana"" but ends with A? Not with N.

Let's choose ""divan"": D, I, V, A, N → positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:V, 4:A, 5:N.

This satisfies:
- N at 5.
- A at position 4: which is allowed (A can be at 1 or 4).
- I at position 2: we have no restriction against position 2? Only that I cannot be at position 4? So position 2 is okay.
- Avoids excluded letters: no C,E,R,L,T.

So guess ""divan"".

Alternatively, to test more vowels? ""axion"" might be less common.

Another word: ""rabid"" not ending with N.

Perhaps ""koine"" but E excluded.

So I'll go with ""divan"".After reviewing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
  → This eliminates C, R, E as possible letters.  
  → Confirms A and N are in the secret word, but not in positions 3 or 4 (since A was guessed in position 3 and N in position 4, both marked wrong).
  
- **Guess 2: latin**  
  Feedback: L(x), A(-), T(x), I(-), N(✓)  
  → This eliminates L and T as possible letters.  
  → Confirms A is not in position 2 (as it was marked wrong here), and I is not in position 4 (marked wrong) but is present in the word.  
  → Confirms N is in position 5 (✓ in position 5).

**Consolidated Insights**:
- Secret word contains: **A**, **I**, and **N** (with **N** fixed at position 5).
- The word ends with **N** (position 5).
- **A** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from previous feedback).
- **I** cannot be in position 4 (from previous feedback).
- Excluded letters: **C, E, R, L, T**.
- Known letter positions:  
Position 5: **N** (confirmed).  
A must be in position 1 or 4 (only available options since positions 2/3 are invalid, and position 5 is taken by N).  
I must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (only options since position 4/5 are invalid/taken).  
- Need to identify two additional letters for the unknown positions (since only A, I, and N are confirmed).

For the next guess, the word **DIVAN** is chosen because it:  
- Includes **A** (in position 4, allowed) and **I** (in position 2, allowed).  
- Includes N at position 5 (confirmed).  
- Uses new common letters (**D** and **V**) not tested before.  
- Avoids all excluded letters (C, E, R, L, T).  
- Tests potential positions for A (position 4) and I (position 2).  
- Is a valid English word meaning a type of sofa or council chamber.  

This guess will help narrow down the possible letters and positions further.",Guess 3: divan -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(-) V(x) A(-) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,AXION,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has:
   - Common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) to maximize information.
   - Avoid repeating letters to cover more distinct letters.

 Some effective starting words in Wordle are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose one that includes two vowels and three consonants, and avoid rare letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.I'm starting the game and need my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starter words include common vowels (like A and E) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T). Words like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""ROAST"" work well. I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it covers three consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), helping identify multiple potential matches.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Since A was in position 3 and N in position 4, they cannot be in those positions in the secret word.
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We must avoid using C, R, E in our next guess.

We also know that A and N are present, so our next guess must include A and N, but not in the 3rd and 4th positions respectively.

We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that uses common letters and avoids the excluded ones (C, R, E) and also avoids putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

We can also consider that the word might have other common letters. Since we have two known letters (A and N), we can try to use them in different positions and also introduce new common letters to test.

Possible positions for A: it cannot be in position 3. So it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
Similarly, N cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We should also avoid using the same positions for A and N as in the first guess because we know they are wrong.

We can look for words that have A and N, and also include other common letters (like S, T, L, I, O, D, H, etc.) but avoid C, R, E.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and are 5 letters.

We can try to put A in position 1 and N in position 2? But we don't know. We need to test.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A and N in positions that we haven't tried and also include other letters we haven't tested.

We have not tested the letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters in English: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Let's try to form a word that includes A and N and three new common letters.

Possible words:

- ""saint"": S, A, I, N, T -> but A is in position 2 and N in position 4? Wait, let's break it:
  S (1), A (2), I (3), N (4), T (5)
  However, in the feedback, we know that A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and that was wrong. But in this word, A is in position 2, which is allowed. Similarly, N was in position 4 in the first guess and that was wrong, but in this word, N is in position 4 again? That would be the same position as before, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put N in position 4.

Therefore, we must avoid putting N in position 4. So ""saint"" is invalid because N is in position 4.

We need a word where N is not in position 4 and A is not in position 3.

Another word: ""stand"" -> S, T, A, N, D
Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5)
But A is in position 3? We know from feedback that A cannot be in position 3. So that's invalid.

Another word: ""tansy"" (a plant) -> T, A, N, S, Y
Positions: T(1), A(2), N(3), S(4), Y(5)
This avoids position 3 for A (A is in 2) and position 4 for N (N is in 3). So that's acceptable.

But we are not sure if ""tansy"" is common. We can try more common words.

Another word: ""plain"" -> P, L, A, I, N
Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)
But A is in position 3? That's the same as the first guess and we know it's wrong. So invalid.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

How about ""panel""? But E is excluded, so we cannot use E.

We cannot use E.

Another word: ""manic"" -> M, A, N, I, C -> but C is excluded. So no.

We must avoid C, R, E.

Another word: ""sandy"" -> S, A, N, D, Y
Positions: S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5)
This is good because A is in 2 (not 3) and N is in 3 (not 4). Also, we are testing S, A, N, D, Y.

But we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""sandy"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""handy"": H, A, N, D, Y -> A in position 2, N in position 3. Also valid.

We can also consider ""latin"" but L, A, T, I, N -> A in position 2, N in position 5. That's acceptable because N is not in 4. But we have to check the positions: 
Position 1: L (new)
Position 2: A (allowed)
Position 3: T (new)
Position 4: I (new)
Position 5: N (allowed, since previously N was in 4 and that was wrong, but 5 is new)

So ""latin"" is acceptable.

But we are testing more letters with ""latin"": L, T, I, and we already know A and N.

We can also consider ""piano"", but that has O and is 5 letters? P-I-A-N-O -> but that has O, and we haven't tested O. However, we are limited by the known letters.

But note: we are trying to find the secret word, and we know it has A and N. We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""stain"" -> S, T, A, I, N -> but A is in position 3? That's not allowed. So no.

""train"" has R and we know R is excluded.

""plain"" has A in position 3 and we cannot use that.

How about ""adorn""? But that's 5 letters? A, D, O, R, N -> but R is excluded, so no.

We must avoid R.

Another word: ""daunt"" -> D, A, U, N, T -> positions: D(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), T(5)
But N is in position 4? We know that N cannot be in position 4 because in the first guess it was in 4 and was wrong. So we cannot use N in position 4. Therefore, ""daunt"" is invalid.

We need to avoid putting N in position 4.

Let me try to list words that have A and N, and avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible words:

- ""sandy"": S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> N is in 3, which is new. A is in 2, which is new.
- ""handy"": H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> same as above but with H.
- ""latin"": L(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), N(5) -> A in 2, N in 5 (new positions).
- ""mania"": M(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. Also, we are testing M, A, N, I. But A is in 2 and 5? We know A is at least once in the word, but maybe twice? We don't have information. However, we are allowed to guess duplicate letters. But in this case, we are testing only 4 distinct letters: M, A, N, I. And we are using A twice.

But we don't know if the word has two A's. It might be inefficient.

Another word: ""paint"" -> P, A, I, N, T -> positions: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but N is in position 4? That's not allowed. So invalid.

""taint"": T, A, I, N, T -> A in position 2, N in position 4 -> invalid because of N in 4.

""nasty"": N, A, S, T, Y -> positions: N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). This is acceptable because A is in 2 (not 3) and N is in 1 (not 4). So we can use ""nasty"".

But note: we are putting N in position 1, which we haven't tried before. And A in 2.

We can also consider ""salsa"" but that has two S's and no N? We need to include N.

We must include both A and N.

After considering, I think ""latin"" is a good choice because it tests L, T, I and places A and N in new positions.

But let's see the feedback we got: we have A and N in the word, so we are trying to find their correct positions and also discover other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A and N in the same positions as before and uses common letters.

I'll go with ""latin"": 
  L (new), A (in word but not in position 3, so we put in 2), T (new), I (new), N (in word but not in position 4, so we put in 5).

This way, we test three new letters and the positions for A and N.

So my next guess is ""latin"".

But note: we are not forced to use both known letters. However, we know the word has A and N, so if we don't include them, we might waste a guess. It's better to include them to get more information about their positions.

Therefore, I choose ""latin"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A and N **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - A cannot be in position 3 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").
  - N cannot be in position 4 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **N** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A in position 3 or N in position 4.
- Must **avoid** using C, R, or E.
- Should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, I, D, O) to maximize information.

After evaluating options, ""latin"" is a strong choice:
- **L** (new), **A** (in position 2, avoiding position 3), **T** (new), **I** (new), **N** (in position 5, avoiding position 4).
- Tests three new common letters (L, T, I) while respecting the known constraints for A and N.

<guess>latin</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: latin -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(x) I(-) N(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess ""crane"":
   - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
   → So, letters C, R, E are not in the secret word.
   → A and N are in the word but in wrong positions. Specifically, A was in position 3 and N in position 4 of ""crane"", so the secret word has A but not in position 3, and N but not in position 4.

2. Guess ""latin"":
   - L(x), A(-), T(x), I(-), N(✓)
   → L and T are not in the word (since x).
   → A is in the word but not in position 2 (since it showed as '-' for position 2 in ""latin"").
   → I is in the word but not in position 4 (since '-' for position 4).
   → N is correct in position 5 (since ✓). So the secret word has N as the fifth letter.

From guess 2, we know:
   - The secret word ends with N (position 5).
   - A is in the word, but not at position 2 (and also not at position 3, from previous guess).
   - I is in the word, but not at position 4.

Also, we know the secret word has A, I, and N (from the two feedbacks). And N is fixed at position 5.

Now, let's consolidate known information:
- Position 5: N (fixed)
- Excluded letters: C, R, E, L, T (from both guesses, all marked x)
- Present letters (must be in the word): A, I, and of course N (but N is already placed).
- A cannot be in position 2 or 3.
- I cannot be in position 4.

Since N is at position 5, the word is _ _ _ _ N.

We have two more letters to discover (since the word is 5 letters and we only know A and I are in it, but there are two more we haven't found because we only have A, I, N so far, and we need five letters).

We know the word contains A, I, and N. Since we have three confirmed letters (A, I, N) and the word is five letters, there are two more letters we haven't identified yet.

We have tested the following letters: C, R, A, N, E (first guess) and L, A, T, I, N (second guess). So the letters we have tested and are excluded: C, R, E, L, T.

We need to choose a word that:
1. Has N at the end (position 5).
2. Contains A and I (and two other letters we haven't tried).
3. A is not in position 2 or 3 (and also not in position 5 because that's N). So A can only be in position 1 or 4? The positions in the word: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 5 is taken by N. So A can be in position 1 or 4? But note: from ""latin"", A was in position 2 (and was wrong) and from ""crane"" in position 3 (wrong). So A cannot be in 2 or 3. Position 5 is N, so indeed A can only be in position 1 or 4.

Similarly, I is not in position 4? Wait, in ""latin"", I was in position 4 and it was marked '-', meaning it is present but not in that position. So I cannot be in position 4. Also, we don't know about other positions. So I can be in 1,2, or 3? But position 5 is N.

So:
- Position for A: only 1 or 4.
- Position for I: only 1,2,3 (but 5 is taken).

Now, if A is in position 1, that leaves I in position 2 or 3? Or if A is in position 4, then I can be in 1,2,3.

We also have two other letters to include.

We need to avoid the excluded letters: C, E, R, L, T.

We should use common letters not tried: for example, S, O, D, M, P, U, B, etc.

Let me try to think of words ending in N and containing A and I.

First, if A is in position 1: then we have A _ _ _ N. And the word must contain I and two other letters.

Possible words: 
- ""ADMIN"" but D, M are new? But ""admin"" is a common word. However, we have to check: 
  - A at 1? Allowed.
  - I: must be in the word, and in ""admin"", I is at position 4? But wait, position 4: I? But we cannot put I in position 4 because feedback says it's not in that position? Wait, in ""latin"", I was in position 4 and it was marked '-', meaning I is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put I in position 4 in a new word, it would be incorrect? Actually, no: the secret word cannot have I in position 4. So in ""admin"", if we try it, and I is in position 4, that would contradict because we know I cannot be at position 4.

Therefore, ""admin"" is invalid because it has I at position 4, which is disallowed.

Similarly, other words: e.g., ""AKING"" is not a word.

""AVAIL"" but ends with L and L is excluded? Also L is excluded, so we cannot use L.

How about ""ASIAN""? Let's check:
  A in position 1? Allowed.
  I: must be in the word. In ""asian"", I is in position 4? Again position 4, which is disallowed. So invalid.

Position for I must be 1,2,3 only. Since position 5 is N and position 4 cannot hold I.

Therefore, if A is in 1 and I in 2 or 3.

For example, ""ALIEN"" but E is excluded and L excluded? And it has E? E is not allowed.

We must avoid E.

Another possibility: ""AMINO"" but O? ""amino"" is a word. But:
  A at position 1? Allowed.
  I: at position 3? That's allowed because position 3 is okay for I? (Yes, since we only know it can't be in position 4).
  But the word ends with O, not N? ""amino"" ends with O? We need to end with N. So not.

Now, other pattern: A in position 4? Then the word is _ _ _ A N.

And I must be in one of positions 1,2,3.

So the word would be _ _ _ A N.

And I can be at 1,2, or 3.

Also, we have two other letters.

Common words: e.g., ""URBAN"" but U and B? But avoids exclusions? 
  U(1), R? R is excluded. So cannot use R.

""Human""? H, U, M, A, N -> but M is allowed? However, U? But E is excluded, R is excluded, but R not here. However, ""human"" has H, U, M, A, N. R is not used, but wait: in first guess R is excluded so we cannot use R? Actually, in ""urban"" we saw R excluded. So ""urban"" not allowed. For ""human"": no excluded letters? We excluded C, R, E, L, T. So H, U, M are new and okay.

But in ""human"", I is not present? The word must contain I? We know I must be in the word. ""human"" has H,U,M,A,N — no I. So we cannot guess that because I is missing.

We must include I.

So words ending with AN and containing I.

For example, ""urban"" has R excluded.

""ROBIN"" has R excluded.

""VIXEN"" has E and X? E excluded.

""CHAIR"" has R and C? Excluded.

A better idea: let's list common words ending with N and containing A and I, and avoid excluded letters.

Excluded: C, E, R, L, T

We can use: S, O, D, M, P, U, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:

- ""SABIN"" (like vaccine) - S,A,B,I,N → forms: S(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), N(5). But note: I is in position 4? We know I cannot be in position 4, because from ""latin"" feedback, I was in position 4 and marked '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put I in position 4. Thus, ""sabin"" would be invalid because it puts I in position 4.

- ""PAIN"" — that's 4 letters, we need 5.

Another: ""MAINS"" — but that ends with S? We need ending with N.

Perhaps ""KIWAN"" — not a valid word.

How about ""DEVIN""? But E excluded? E is excluded.

""BLIND"" — ends with D? Not N.

Perhaps ""BRAIN"" — has R, excluded.

""DAISY"" — ends with Y? Not N.

This is tricky.

Another pattern: A in position 4. So the word is ... A N at end. And I must be in position 1,2, or 3.

For example: a word like X X I A N -> positions: 1,2,3,4,5: N already set. So [1][2][3] A N.

And I at 1,2, or 3.

For instance, ""VIXEN"" -> V, I, X, E, N -> but E excluded and ends with N? X and E is excluded? E is excluded, so invalid.

""ANIM U"" — not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""OXBOW"" — no I and no A? And not ending with N.

Let's think: ""BASIN"" -> B, A, S, I, N -> but I is at position 4? Not allowed. 
Similarly, ""ROSIN"" has R excluded.

How about ""MAIDEN""? Too long.

5-letter? ""OCTAN"" not a common word.

Another: ""ADMIN"" we already saw has I in position 4? ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N → I is at position 4? Disallowed.

But we need I not in position 4.

So maybe I in position 2 or 3.

For example, with A at 4: 
- Position 1: put I? Then I(1), then position 2,3 are new letters, A(4), N(5). So I _ _ A N.

But can we have I at position 1? We don't know until we try.

For instance: ""IRAQ N"" not valid.

""ISL AN"" but L excluded and not a word.

""IMAGN"" not a word.

Maybe without I at 1? With I at position 2: for example, X I X A N.

And no excluded letters.

So for position 1, we can put S: ""S I T A N"" but T is excluded? T is marked x in second guess. So we cannot use T.

Similarly, D: ""D I V A N"" → DIVAN is a word? D(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), N(5). This might work. Avoiding excluded letters: D, V not excluded? Only C,E,R,L,T excluded.

So DIVAN: 
- D not tested, 
- I: in position 2? We have no information that I cannot be at position 2? We only know it cannot be at position 4. So position 2 is allowed.
- V new, 
- A in position 4: and we said A can be in position 4? Yes.
- N at 5.

So DIVAN could be a guess.

Similarly, ""P I C A N"" but C excluded? Or ""WICAN"" not a word.

Another word: ""W I D A N"" not a word.

""DIVAN"" seems valid.

But is ""divan"" common? It means a sofa.

We could try ""S I M A N"" but not a word? We have ""simian"" but that's 6 letters? Simian is 6? S-I-M-I-A-N, 6 letters.

No, 5-letter: SIMAN is not a valid word.

Other possibilities: ""B I D A N"" not a word.

""IVYAN"" not a word.

So ""divan"" is a possibility.

Another structure: A not in position 4, but in position 1? Earlier we considered.

Position 1: A, and then I at position 3? So A _ I _ N.

With position 2 and 4 are new.

Words: ""ALIGN"" but L excluded and G? L excluded.

""AXION"": A, X, I, O, N → positions: A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). This seems good. 
- A at position 1: allowed.
- I at position 3: we have no restriction against position 3 for I? Only position 4 is forbidden. 
- Avoids excluded letters? X, O not excluded? Only C,E,R,L,T excluded.

""Axion"" is a word (physics term).

So ""axion"" could be another guess.

We also have ""avion"" but that's French, usually ""avion"" is not English word? We need English word. ""Axion"" is English.

Similarly, ""PRION"" has R excluded.

""DENIM"" ends with M? Not N.

So possibilities: ""divan"" or ""axion"".

But ""axion"" tests more common letters? X is less common.

We can also consider ""admin"" but invalid because of I in position 4.

Another common word: ""RAIN"" has only 4.

We already have ""divan"" and ""axion"".

But let's see if there is a better word? We want to test common letters.

Letters not tested: S has not been tested? We haven't used S.

In first guess: crane had no S.
Second guess: latin had no S.

Similarly, O, D, M, P, U, B, G, H, Y, etc.

So perhaps we should include S to test.

Why not a word with S and O or something.

For example, with A in position 1 and I in position 3? We have A _ I _ N.

So positions: [1]=A, [3]=I, [5]=N, then [2] and [4] to fill.

We need to choose two letters. Avoid excluded C,E,R,L,T.

Possible: [2]=S, [4]=O? Then ""ASION""? But ""asion"" is not a word.

[2]=O, [4]=S: ""A O I S N"" → ""aoisn"" not a word.

[2]=M, [4]=S: ""AMIS N"" → ""amiss"" ends with SS? Not N.

N is at 5.

Another: [2]=D, [4]=O: ""ADION"" not a word.

""ADMIN"" becomes invalid.

Perhaps with A in position 4.

As before: _ _ _ A N, with I in one of the first three.

And including S.

For example: position 1=S, position 2=I, position 3=O, then ""S I O A N"" → ""sion a n""? Not a word.

Position 1=O, position 2=I, position 3=S: ""O I S A N"" → ""o is a n"" not a word.

Perhaps ""DAISY"" does not end with N.

But we have ""doing"" not end with N.

Another word: ""SPAIN"" has P, but I at position 4? ""spain"": S(1), P(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). 
But:
- A is at position 3? From first guess with ""crane"", A in position 3 was wrong. We cannot put A in position 3. So ""spain"" would have A in position 3, invalid.

Similarly, ""train"" has R.

""MAINS"" is M,A,I,N,S → ends with S? S is at position 5 but we need position 5=N.

So not.

Considering ""divan"" and ""axion"", both are valid and satisfy the constraints.

Alternatively, ""damn"" is 4 letters.

""Pagan"" ends with N? G,A,N → but pag a n? P A G A N -> that has two A's? And it ends with N? But we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? We don't have information against that.

""pagan"": P(1), A(2), G(3), A(4), N(5). But note: A is in position 2, which from ""latin"" we know A cannot be in position 2 (because in ""latin"" A was in position 2 and marked '-', meaning it is in the word but wrong position). So we cannot put A in position 2? Exactly.

In ""pagan"", A is in position 2: that is disallowed because we already tried A in position 2 and it was not correct.

Similarly, A is in position 4? Which is okay? But the word has two A's? Possibly? But position 4 for A is allowed because we haven't tried it? The only positions A cannot be are 2 and 3.

So ""Pagan"": 
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: A (not allowed because we know from guess 2 that position 2 has A and it was wrong)
- Position 3: G
- Position 4: A (allowed, because we haven't tried position 4 yet)
- Position 5: N

But in the word ""pagan"", position 2 also has A? However, the feedback would show for position 2: A in position 2 is disallowed? Specifically, we know from ""latin"" that when we put A in position 2, it was incorrect. Therefore, we cannot use that in a new word? Unless we are testing for duplicate: the word might have two A's? But position 2 cannot have A because we already know it's wrong.

So when we say 'disallowed', it means that in the secret word, position 2 is not A? Because it was tried and marked as wrong position. So the secret word does not have A in position 2.

Therefore, ""pagan"" would be invalid for guess because it puts A in position 2.

So we discard.

Back to ""divan"" or ""axion"".

Since we haven't tested S, perhaps we can look for a word that includes S and avoids positions.

For example, if A is in position 4, then we have _ _ _ A N.

And I in position 1,2, or 3.

With S? For example, ""USN IA N"" not a word.

"" MAS A N"" with I? e.g., ""MAJOR"" not ending with N.

Another common ending: ""woman"" W O M A N? Ends with N? That's a valid word: W(1), O(2), M(3), A(4), N(5). 
- And we have A at position 4: allowed.
- Does it have I? No, ""woman"" has no I? But we must include I? The secret word has I? From feedback: in ""latin"", I was marked in the word (since '-')? Yes, I is in the secret word. But ""woman"" has W,O,M,A,N — no I. So we cannot choose it.

Similarly, ""human"" no I.

So we must have a word with I.

Now, let's try to find words like ""vista n"" not.

Perhaps ""divan"" is the best choice? Or ""axion"".

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that has more common letters? ""divan"" has D, I, V, A, N; we know A and N, but D and V are new. And I is tested for position 2.

Similarly, ""axion"" has A, X, I, O, N; X is less common? But O is common.

Another idea: ""SHIN"" is 4 letters.

""Begin"" has G? ""begin"" B,E,G,I,N → but E excluded? E is excluded.

""piano"" not ending in N.

I think our best bets are ""divan"" or ""axion"". We can also consider ""diana"" but ends with A? Not with N.

Let's choose ""divan"": D, I, V, A, N → positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:V, 4:A, 5:N.

This satisfies:
- N at 5.
- A at position 4: which is allowed (A can be at 1 or 4).
- I at position 2: we have no restriction against position 2? Only that I cannot be at position 4? So position 2 is okay.
- Avoids excluded letters: no C,E,R,L,T.

So guess ""divan"".

Alternatively, to test more vowels? ""axion"" might be less common.

Another word: ""rabid"" not ending with N.

Perhaps ""koine"" but E excluded.

So I'll go with ""divan"".After reviewing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
  → This eliminates C, R, E as possible letters.  
  → Confirms A and N are in the secret word, but not in positions 3 or 4 (since A was guessed in position 3 and N in position 4, both marked wrong).
  
- **Guess 2: latin**  
  Feedback: L(x), A(-), T(x), I(-), N(✓)  
  → This eliminates L and T as possible letters.  
  → Confirms A is not in position 2 (as it was marked wrong here), and I is not in position 4 (marked wrong) but is present in the word.  
  → Confirms N is in position 5 (✓ in position 5).

**Consolidated Insights**:
- Secret word contains: **A**, **I**, and **N** (with **N** fixed at position 5).
- The word ends with **N** (position 5).
- **A** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from previous feedback).
- **I** cannot be in position 4 (from previous feedback).
- Excluded letters: **C, E, R, L, T**.
- Known letter positions:  
Position 5: **N** (confirmed).  
A must be in position 1 or 4 (only available options since positions 2/3 are invalid, and position 5 is taken by N).  
I must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (only options since position 4/5 are invalid/taken).  
- Need to identify two additional letters for the unknown positions (since only A, I, and N are confirmed).

For the next guess, the word **DIVAN** is chosen because it:  
- Includes **A** (in position 4, allowed) and **I** (in position 2, allowed).  
- Includes N at position 5 (confirmed).  
- Uses new common letters (**D** and **V**) not tested before.  
- Avoids all excluded letters (C, E, R, L, T).  
- Tests potential positions for A (position 4) and I (position 2).  
- Is a valid English word meaning a type of sofa or council chamber.  

This guess will help narrow down the possible letters and positions further.

But in this word, A is in position 2, which is allowed. Similarly, N was in position 4 in the first guess and that was wrong, but in this word, N is in position 4 again? That would be the same position as before, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put N in position 4.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid putting N in position 4.

So that\'s invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""tansy"" (a plant) -> T, A, N, S, Y\nPositions: T(1), A(2), N(3), S(4), Y(5)\nThis avoids position 3 for A (A is in 2) and position 4 for N (N is in 3).

Also, we are testing S, A, N, D, Y.\n\nBut we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. ""sandy"" is a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, ""handy"": H, A, N, D, Y -> A in position 2, N in position 3. Also valid.\n\nWe can also consider ""latin"" but L, A, T, I, N -> A in position 2, N in position 5. That\'s acceptable because N is not in 4.

So no.\n\n""train"" has R and we know R is excluded.\n\n""plain"" has A in position 3 and we cannot use that.\n\nHow about ""adorn""? But that\'s 5 letters? A, D, O, R, N -> but R is excluded, so no.\n\nWe must avoid R.\n\nAnother word: ""daunt"" -> D, A, U, N, T -> positions: D(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), T(5)\nBut N is in position 4? We know that N cannot be in position 4 because in the first guess it was in 4 and was wrong. So we cannot use N in position 4. Therefore, ""daunt"" is invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid putting N in position 4.\n\nLet me try to list words that have A and N, and avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N, and avoid C, R, E.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""sandy"": S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> N is in 3, which is new. A is in 2, which is new.\n- ""handy"": H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> same as above but with H.\n- ""latin"": L(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), N(5) -> A in 2, N in 5 (new positions).\n- ""mania"": M(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5) -> but we have two A\'s? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. Also, we are testing M, A, N, I. But A is in 2 and 5? We know A is at least once in the word, but maybe twice? We don\'t have information. However, we are allowed to guess duplicate letters. But in this case, we are testing only 4 distinct letters: M, A, N, I. And we are using A twice.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. It might be inefficient.\n\nAnother word: ""paint"" -> P, A, I, N, T -> positions: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but N is in position 4? That\'s not allowed. So invalid.\n\n""taint"": T, A, I, N, T -> A in position 2, N in position 4 -> invalid because of N in 4.\n\n""nasty"": N, A, S, T, Y -> positions: N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). This is acceptable because A is in 2 (not 3) and N is in 1 (not 4). So we can use ""nasty"".\n\nBut note: we are putting N in position 1, which we haven\'t tried before. And A in 2.\n\nWe can also consider ""salsa"" but that has two S\'s and no N? We need to include N.\n\nWe must include both A and N.\n\nAfter considering, I think ""latin"" is a good choice because it tests L, T, I and places A and N in new positions.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we got: we have A and N in the word, so we are trying to find their correct positions and also discover other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put A and N in the same positions as before and uses common letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""latin"": \n  L (new), A (in word but not in position 3, so we put in 2), T (new), I (new), N (in word but not in position 4, so we put in 5).\n\nThis way, we test three new letters and the positions for A and N.\n\nSo my next guess is ""latin"".\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use both known letters. However, we know the word has A and N, so if we don\'t include them, we might waste a guess. It\'s better to include them to get more information about their positions.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""latin"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- A and N **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:\n  - A cannot be in position 3 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").\n  - N cannot be in position 4 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** and **N** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A in position 3 or N in position 4.\n- Must **avoid** using C, R, or E.\n- Should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, I, D, O) to maximize information.\n\nAfter evaluating options, ""latin"" is a strong choice:\n- **L** (new), **A** (in position 2, avoiding position 3), **T** (new), **I** (new), **N** (in position 5, avoiding position 4).\n- Tests three new common letters (L, T, I) while respecting the known constraints for A and N.\n\n<guess>latin</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: latin -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(x) I(-) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. Guess ""crane"":\n   - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)\n   → So, letters C, R, E are not in the secret word.\n   → A and N are in the word but in wrong positions. Specifically, A was in position 3 and N in position 4 of ""crane"", so the secret word has A but not in position 3, and N but not in position 4.\n\n2. Guess ""latin"":\n   - L(x), A(-), T(x), I(-), N(✓)\n   → L and T are not in the word (since x).\n   → A is in the word but not in position 2 (since it showed as \'-\' for position 2 in ""latin"").\n   → I is in the word but not in position 4 (since \'-\' for position 4).\n   → N is correct in position 5 (since ✓). So the secret word has N as the fifth letter.\n\nFrom guess 2, we know:\n   - The secret word ends with N (position 5).\n   - A is in the word, but not at position 2 (and also not at position 3, from previous guess).\n   - I is in the word, but not at position 4.\n\nAlso, we know the secret word has A, I, and N (from the two feedbacks). And N is fixed at position 5.\n\nNow, let\'s consolidate known information:\n- Position 5: N (fixed)\n- Excluded letters: C, R, E, L, T (from both guesses, all marked x)\n- Present letters (must be in the word): A, I, and of course N (but N is already placed).\n- A cannot be in position 2 or 3.\n- I cannot be in position 4.\n\nSince N is at position 5, the word is _ _ _ _ N.\n\nWe have two more letters to discover (since the word is 5 letters and we only know A and I are in it, but there are two more we haven\'t found because we only have A, I, N so far, and we need five letters).\n\nWe know the word contains A, I, and N. Since we have three confirmed letters (A, I, N) and the word is five letters, there are two more letters we haven\'t identified yet.\n\nWe have tested the following letters: C, R, A, N, E (first guess) and L, A, T, I, N (second guess). So the letters we have tested and are excluded: C, R, E, L, T.\n\nWe need to choose a word that:\n1. Has N at the end (position 5).\n2. Contains A and I (and two other letters we haven\'t tried).\n3. A is not in position 2 or 3 (and also not in position 5 because that\'s N). So A can only be in position 1 or 4? The positions in the word: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 5 is taken by N. So A can be in position 1 or 4? But note: from ""latin"", A was in position 2 (and was wrong) and from ""crane"" in position 3 (wrong). So A cannot be in 2 or 3. Position 5 is N, so indeed A can only be in position 1 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, I is not in position 4? Wait, in ""latin"", I was in position 4 and it was marked \'-\', meaning it is present but not in that position. So I cannot be in position 4. Also, we don\'t know about other positions. So I can be in 1,2, or 3? But position 5 is N.\n\nSo:\n- Position for A: only 1 or 4.\n- Position for I: only 1,2,3 (but 5 is taken).\n\nNow, if A is in position 1, that leaves I in position 2 or 3? Or if A is in position 4, then I can be in 1,2,3.\n\nWe also have two other letters to include.\n\nWe need to avoid the excluded letters: C, E, R, L, T.\n\nWe should use common letters not tried: for example, S, O, D, M, P, U, B, etc.\n\nLet me try to think of words ending in N and containing A and I.\n\nFirst, if A is in position 1: then we have A _ _ _ N. And the word must contain I and two other letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""ADMIN"" but D, M are new? But ""admin"" is a common word. However, we have to check: \n  - A at 1? Allowed.\n  - I: must be in the word, and in ""admin"", I is at position 4? But wait, position 4: I? But we cannot put I in position 4 because feedback says it\'s not in that position? Wait, in ""latin"", I was in position 4 and it was marked \'-\', meaning I is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put I in position 4 in a new word, it would be incorrect? Actually, no: the secret word cannot have I in position 4. So in ""admin"", if we try it, and I is in position 4, that would contradict because we know I cannot be at position 4.\n\nTherefore, ""admin"" is invalid because it has I at position 4, which is disallowed.\n\nSimilarly, other words: e.g., ""AKING"" is not a word.\n\n""AVAIL"" but ends with L and L is excluded? Also L is excluded, so we cannot use L.\n\nHow about ""ASIAN""? Let\'s check:\n  A in position 1? Allowed.\n  I: must be in the word. In ""asian"", I is in position 4? Again position 4, which is disallowed. So invalid.\n\nPosition for I must be 1,2,3 only. Since position 5 is N and position 4 cannot hold I.\n\nTherefore, if A is in 1 and I in 2 or 3.\n\nFor example, ""ALIEN"" but E is excluded and L excluded? And it has E? E is not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nAnother possibility: ""AMINO"" but O? ""amino"" is a word. But:\n  A at position 1? Allowed.\n  I: at position 3? That\'s allowed because position 3 is okay for I? (Yes, since we only know it can\'t be in position 4).\n  But the word ends with O, not N? ""amino"" ends with O? We need to end with N. So not.\n\nNow, other pattern: A in position 4? Then the word is _ _ _ A N.\n\nAnd I must be in one of positions 1,2,3.\n\nSo the word would be _ _ _ A N.\n\nAnd I can be at 1,2, or 3.\n\nAlso, we have two other letters.\n\nCommon words: e.g., ""URBAN"" but U and B? But avoids exclusions? \n  U(1), R? R is excluded. So cannot use R.\n\n""Human""? H, U, M, A, N -> but M is allowed? However, U? But E is excluded, R is excluded, but R not here. However, ""human"" has H, U, M, A, N. R is not used, but wait: in first guess R is excluded so we cannot use R? Actually, in ""urban"" we saw R excluded. So ""urban"" not allowed. For ""human"": no excluded letters? We excluded C, R, E, L, T. So H, U, M are new and okay.\n\nBut in ""human"", I is not present? The word must contain I? We know I must be in the word. ""human"" has H,U,M,A,N — no I. So we cannot guess that because I is missing.\n\nWe must include I.\n\nSo words ending with AN and containing I.\n\nFor example, ""urban"" has R excluded.\n\n""ROBIN"" has R excluded.\n\n""VIXEN"" has E and X? E excluded.\n\n""CHAIR"" has R and C? Excluded.\n\nA better idea: let\'s list common words ending with N and containing A and I, and avoid excluded letters.\n\nExcluded: C, E, R, L, T\n\nWe can use: S, O, D, M, P, U, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""SABIN"" (like vaccine) - S,A,B,I,N → forms: S(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), N(5). But note: I is in position 4? We know I cannot be in position 4, because from ""latin"" feedback, I was in position 4 and marked \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put I in position 4. Thus, ""sabin"" would be invalid because it puts I in position 4.\n\n- ""PAIN"" — that\'s 4 letters, we need 5.\n\nAnother: ""MAINS"" — but that ends with S? We need ending with N.\n\nPerhaps ""KIWAN"" — not a valid word.\n\nHow about ""DEVIN""? But E excluded? E is excluded.\n\n""BLIND"" — ends with D? Not N.\n\nPerhaps ""BRAIN"" — has R, excluded.\n\n""DAISY"" — ends with Y? Not N.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAnother pattern: A in position 4. So the word is ... A N at end. And I must be in position 1,2, or 3.\n\nFor example: a word like X X I A N -> positions: 1,2,3,4,5: N already set. So [1][2][3] A N.\n\nAnd I at 1,2, or 3.\n\nFor instance, ""VIXEN"" -> V, I, X, E, N -> but E excluded and ends with N? X and E is excluded? E is excluded, so invalid.\n\n""ANIM U"" — not 5 letters.\n\nPerhaps ""OXBOW"" — no I and no A? And not ending with N.\n\nLet\'s think: ""BASIN"" -> B, A, S, I, N -> but I is at position 4? Not allowed. \nSimilarly, ""ROSIN"" has R excluded.\n\nHow about ""MAIDEN""? Too long.\n\n5-letter? ""OCTAN"" not a common word.\n\nAnother: ""ADMIN"" we already saw has I in position 4? ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N → I is at position 4? Disallowed.\n\nBut we need I not in position 4.\n\nSo maybe I in position 2 or 3.\n\nFor example, with A at 4: \n- Position 1: put I? Then I(1), then position 2,3 are new letters, A(4), N(5). So I _ _ A N.\n\nBut can we have I at position 1? We don\'t know until we try.\n\nFor instance: ""IRAQ N"" not valid.\n\n""ISL AN"" but L excluded and not a word.\n\n""IMAGN"" not a word.\n\nMaybe without I at 1? With I at position 2: for example, X I X A N.\n\nAnd no excluded letters.\n\nSo for position 1, we can put S: ""S I T A N"" but T is excluded? T is marked x in second guess. So we cannot use T.\n\nSimilarly, D: ""D I V A N"" → DIVAN is a word? D(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), N(5). This might work. Avoiding excluded letters: D, V not excluded? Only C,E,R,L,T excluded.\n\nSo DIVAN: \n- D not tested, \n- I: in position 2? We have no information that I cannot be at position 2? We only know it cannot be at position 4. So position 2 is allowed.\n- V new, \n- A in position 4: and we said A can be in position 4? Yes.\n- N at 5.\n\nSo DIVAN could be a guess.\n\nSimilarly, ""P I C A N"" but C excluded? Or ""WICAN"" not a word.\n\nAnother word: ""W I D A N"" not a word.\n\n""DIVAN"" seems valid.\n\nBut is ""divan"" common? It means a sofa.\n\nWe could try ""S I M A N"" but not a word? We have ""simian"" but that\'s 6 letters? Simian is 6? S-I-M-I-A-N, 6 letters.\n\nNo, 5-letter: SIMAN is not a valid word.\n\nOther possibilities: ""B I D A N"" not a word.\n\n""IVYAN"" not a word.\n\nSo ""divan"" is a possibility.\n\nAnother structure: A not in position 4, but in position 1? Earlier we considered.\n\nPosition 1: A, and then I at position 3? So A _ I _ N.\n\nWith position 2 and 4 are new.\n\nWords: ""ALIGN"" but L excluded and G? L excluded.\n\n""AXION"": A, X, I, O, N → positions: A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). This seems good. \n- A at position 1: allowed.\n- I at position 3: we have no restriction against position 3 for I? Only position 4 is forbidden. \n- Avoids excluded letters? X, O not excluded? Only C,E,R,L,T excluded.\n\n""Axion"" is a word (physics term).\n\nSo ""axion"" could be another guess.\n\nWe also have ""avion"" but that\'s French, usually ""avion"" is not English word? We need English word. ""Axion"" is English.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRION"" has R excluded.\n\n""DENIM"" ends with M? Not N.\n\nSo possibilities: ""divan"" or ""axion"".\n\nBut ""axion"" tests more common letters? X is less common.\n\nWe can also consider ""admin"" but invalid because of I in position 4.\n\nAnother common word: ""RAIN"" has only 4.\n\nWe already have ""divan"" and ""axion"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a better word? We want to test common letters.\n\nLetters not tested: S has not been tested? We haven\'t used S.\n\nIn first guess: crane had no S.\nSecond guess: latin had no S.\n\nSimilarly, O, D, M, P, U, B, G, H, Y, etc.\n\nSo perhaps we should include S to test.\n\nWhy not a word with S and O or something.\n\nFor example, with A in position 1 and I in position 3? We have A _ I _ N.\n\nSo positions: [1]=A, [3]=I, [5]=N, then [2] and [4] to fill.\n\nWe need to choose two letters. Avoid excluded C,E,R,L,T.\n\nPossible: [2]=S, [4]=O? Then ""ASION""? But ""asion"" is not a word.\n\n[2]=O, [4]=S: ""A O I S N"" → ""aoisn"" not a word.\n\n[2]=M, [4]=S: ""AMIS N"" → ""amiss"" ends with SS? Not N.\n\nN is at 5.\n\nAnother: [2]=D, [4]=O: ""ADION"" not a word.\n\n""ADMIN"" becomes invalid.\n\nPerhaps with A in position 4.\n\nAs before: _ _ _ A N, with I in one of the first three.\n\nAnd including S.\n\nFor example: position 1=S, position 2=I, position 3=O, then ""S I O A N"" → ""sion a n""? Not a word.\n\nPosition 1=O, position 2=I, position 3=S: ""O I S A N"" → ""o is a n"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""DAISY"" does not end with N.\n\nBut we have ""doing"" not end with N.\n\nAnother word: ""SPAIN"" has P, but I at position 4? ""spain"": S(1), P(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). \nBut:\n- A is at position 3? From first guess with ""crane"", A in position 3 was wrong. We cannot put A in position 3. So ""spain"" would have A in position 3, invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""train"" has R.\n\n""MAINS"" is M,A,I,N,S → ends with S? S is at position 5 but we need position 5=N.\n\nSo not.\n\nConsidering ""divan"" and ""axion"", both are valid and satisfy the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, ""damn"" is 4 letters.\n\n""Pagan"" ends with N? G,A,N → but pag a n? P A G A N -> that has two A\'s? And it ends with N? But we don\'t know if duplicate letters are allowed? We don\'t have information against that.\n\n""pagan"": P(1), A(2), G(3), A(4), N(5). But note: A is in position 2, which from ""latin"" we know A cannot be in position 2 (because in ""latin"" A was in position 2 and marked \'-\', meaning it is in the word but wrong position). So we cannot put A in position 2? Exactly.\n\nIn ""pagan"", A is in position 2: that is disallowed because we already tried A in position 2 and it was not correct.\n\nSimilarly, A is in position 4? Which is okay? But the word has two A\'s? Possibly? But position 4 for A is allowed because we haven\'t tried it? The only positions A cannot be are 2 and 3.\n\nSo ""Pagan"": \n- Position 1: P\n- Position 2: A (not allowed because we know from guess 2 that position 2 has A and it was wrong)\n- Position 3: G\n- Position 4: A (allowed, because we haven\'t tried position 4 yet)\n- Position 5: N\n\nBut in the word ""pagan"", position 2 also has A? However, the feedback would show for position 2: A in position 2 is disallowed? Specifically, we know from ""latin"" that when we put A in position 2, it was incorrect. Therefore, we cannot use that in a new word? Unless we are testing for duplicate: the word might have two A\'s? But position 2 cannot have A because we already know it\'s wrong.\n\nSo when we say \'disallowed\', it means that in the secret word, position 2 is not A? Because it was tried and marked as wrong position. So the secret word does not have A in position 2.\n\nTherefore, ""pagan"" would be invalid for guess because it puts A in position 2.\n\nSo we discard.\n\nBack to ""divan"" or ""axion"".\n\nSince we haven\'t tested S, perhaps we can look for a word that includes S and avoids positions.\n\nFor example, if A is in position 4, then we have _ _ _ A N.\n\nAnd I in position 1,2, or 3.\n\nWith S? For example, ""USN IA N"" not a word.\n\n"" MAS A N"" with I? e.g., ""MAJOR"" not ending with N.\n\nAnother common ending: ""woman"" W O M A N? Ends with N? That\'s a valid word: W(1), O(2), M(3), A(4), N(5). \n- And we have A at position 4: allowed.\n- Does it have I? No, ""woman"" has no I? But we must include I? The secret word has I? From feedback: in ""latin"", I was marked in the word (since \'-\')? Yes, I is in the secret word. But ""woman"" has W,O,M,A,N — no I. So we cannot choose it.\n\nSimilarly, ""human"" no I.\n\nSo we must have a word with I.\n\nNow, let\'s try to find words like ""vista n"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""divan"" is the best choice? Or ""axion"".\n\nBut to maximize information, we can choose a word that has more common letters? ""divan"" has D, I, V, A, N; we know A and N, but D and V are new. And I is tested for position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""axion"" has A, X, I, O, N; X is less common? But O is common.\n\nAnother idea: ""SHIN"" is 4 letters.\n\n""Begin"" has G? ""begin"" B,E,G,I,N → but E excluded? E is excluded.\n\n""piano"" not ending in N.\n\nI think our best bets are ""divan"" or ""axion"". We can also consider ""diana"" but ends with A? Not with N.\n\nLet\'s choose ""divan"": D, I, V, A, N → positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:V, 4:A, 5:N.\n\nThis satisfies:\n- N at 5.\n- A at position 4: which is allowed (A can be at 1 or 4).\n- I at position 2: we have no restriction against position 2? Only that I cannot be at position 4? So position 2 is okay.\n- Avoids excluded letters: no C,E,R,L,T.\n\nSo guess ""divan"".\n\nAlternatively, to test more vowels? ""axion"" might be less common.\n\nAnother word: ""rabid"" not ending with N.\n\nPerhaps ""koine"" but E excluded.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""divan"".After reviewing the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane**  \n  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  \n  → This eliminates C, R, E as possible letters.  \n  → Confirms A and N are in the secret word, but not in positions 3 or 4 (since A was guessed in position 3 and N in position 4, both marked wrong).\n  \n- **Guess 2: latin**  \n  Feedback: L(x), A(-), T(x), I(-), N(✓)  \n  → This eliminates L and T as possible letters.  \n  → Confirms A is not in position 2 (as it was marked wrong here), and I is not in position 4 (marked wrong) but is present in the word.  \n  → Confirms N is in position 5 (✓ in position 5).\n\n**Consolidated Insights**:\n- Secret word contains: **A**, **I**, and **N** (with **N** fixed at position 5).\n- The word ends with **N** (position 5).\n- **A** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from previous feedback).\n- **I** cannot be in position 4 (from previous feedback).\n- Excluded letters: **C, E, R, L, T**.\n- Known letter positions:  \nPosition 5: **N** (confirmed).  \nA must be in position 1 or 4 (only available options since positions 2/3 are invalid, and position 5 is taken by N).  \nI must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (only options since position 4/5 are invalid/taken).  \n- Need to identify two additional letters for the unknown positions (since only A, I, and N are confirmed).\n\nFor the next guess, the word **DIVAN** is chosen because it:  \n- Includes **A** (in position 4, allowed) and **I** (in position 2, allowed).  \n- Includes N at position 5 (confirmed).  \n- Uses new common letters (**D** and **V**) not tested before.  \n- Avoids all excluded letters (C, E, R, L, T).  \n- Tests potential positions for A (position 4) and I (position 2).  \n- Is a valid English word meaning a type of sofa or council chamber.  \n\nThis guess will help narrow down the possible letters and positions further.\n\n<guess>divan</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: latin -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(x) I(-) N(✓)\nGuess 3: divan -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(-) V(x) A(-) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(absent)
   - Thus, the word contains A and N, but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively (since in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N in position 4).
   - Excluded letters: C, R, E.

2. **latin**: L(absent), A(present but wrong position), T(absent), I(present but wrong position), N(correct position at 5)
   - N is fixed at position 5.
   - A is not at position 2 (since it was guessed there and marked wrong position).
   - I is not at position 4 (marked wrong position).
   - Excluded letters: L, T (added to previous exclusions: C, E, R, L, T).
   - Present letters: A, I, N.

3. **divan**: D(absent), I(present but wrong position), V(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(correct position at 5)
   - D and V are absent, so add to excluded letters: D, V.
   - I is in the word but not at position 2 (since it was in position 2 of ""divan"" and marked '-').
   - A is in the word but not at position 4 (since it was in position 4 and marked '-').

Consolidating:
- **Confirmed positions**: Position 5 is N.
- **Confirmed present letters**: A, I, N (N is at position 5, so we focus on A and I).
- **Letters that must be in the word**: A, I (since they are present).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, L, T, D, V.

Now, constraints on positions:
- A cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from guess 1 and 2), and now also not position 4 (from guess 3). Therefore, A must be in position 1? The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 5 is N, so A can only be in 1 or 4? But now we know A is not in 4? From ""divan"", A was in position 4 and marked '-'? So A is not in position 4. Thus, only position 1 is left for A? So A must be in position 1.

Similarly for I:
- I cannot be in position 4 (from ""latin"") and also not in position 2 (from ""divan""). Therefore, I can be in position 1 or 3? But position 1: if A is there? Conflict? 

Wait, A and I both need positions. Since A must be in position 1? Then what about I? It must be in position 3? Because:
- Positions available: 1,2,3,4,5 (5 is taken by N).
- A: must be 1? Since it can't be 2,3,4? And 5 is taken? So only position 1 for A.
- Then I: cannot be in position 4 (known) and cannot be in position 2 (from ""divan""). So I must be in position 3? Because positions 1 and 2 are excluded for I? Position 1 has A? So I cannot be there? So position 3 is the only option? Then position 2 and 4 are the remaining unknown letters? And we have two unknown letters? Of course, total 5 letters: position 1=A, position 2=?, position 3=I, position 4=?, position 5=N.

Now, the word has form: A ? I ? N

Where ? are the missing letters? But wait, we only have A, I, N, we need two more letters? And we know they are not among the excluded? So letters left? But we haven't tried many.

Also, we know the secret word has exactly these letters? Not exactly? We only know that A, I, N are present? And from tests, we have used only limited letters? But there are two more to be guessed.

Therefore, the word structure is A _ I _ N? And we need to determine the letters at positions 2 and 4? And they must be letters not excluded? Excluded letters: C, E, R, L, T, D, V.

So possible letters: from English alphabet, minus excluded? Common letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to choose two letters? And form a valid English word.

Also, we must avoid positions? For the unknown positions, we don't have known constraints.

Therefore, we have to guess a word that starts with A, has I in position 3, ends with N, and positions 2 and 4 are unknown? With the specified letters.

But now, we also have to ensure that the word has not any excluded letters? And of course, must be a valid English word.

Let's find such words:

Pattern: A ? I ? N

Possible words:
- ""AGAIN"": But ""again"" has G? Positions: A(1), G(2), A(3), I? But no I? ""again"" is A,G,A,I,N? Wait: positions: A(1), G(2), A? No, ""again"" has two A's? Letter at position 3: A? But we need I at position 3? However, the word ""again"" has A at position 3? Not I? And it has I at position 4? But we need I at position 3? So not? ""again"": A(1),G(2),A(3),I(4),N(5) → I is at position 4? But we require I at position 3? So this does not match? We are guessing that I must be at position 3? Based on our deduction? So for our guess, if we believe that, then positions: 1=A, 2=?, 3=I, 4=?, 5=N? Then ""again"" which is A,G,A,I,N would not fit? Because it has I at 4? Not at 3.

Similarly, ""ADMIN"" has D excluded? And M at position 2? And I at position 4? Not at 3? But D excluded? Anyway, doesn't have I at position 3.

""ALIGN"" has L excluded? And L at position 2? And I? Position? ""align"": A(1),L(2),I(3),G(4),N(5)? But L excluded? Cannot use? But if not excluded, it matches? But L is excluded, so invalid? And we know L is absent? So cannot be used.

So find a word: A ? I ? N, with position 3: I? So words like ""AXIOM"" has O? But ends with M? Not N? ""axiom"" is A,X,I,O,M → ends with M? Not N.

""BEGIN"": B,E,G,I,N → E excluded? E is not allowed.

""BITING"": 6 letters? Too long? We need 5-letter.

""CAVIN"": C excluded? Cannot.

Valid words? For example: ""ASPIN""? Not a word? Or ""AVIAN"": A(1),V(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? But V excluded? We tried V? From ""divan"", V is absent? So excluded? Cannot use V.

""HEMIN"": H,E,M,I,N → E excluded.

""KABIN""? Not a word? ""cabin"" has C excluded.

Perhaps ""MAIN"" has only 4.

A common word: ""OPINE"" ends with E? Not N.

Another: ""QUINS"" plural? But ends with S? Not N.

Word like ""AXION"": we considered earlier? A,X,I,O,N → positions: A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). This matches: A at 1, I at 3, N at 5? And X and O? Both not excluded? And is a valid word? (physics term).

So ""axion"" could be a candidate? But let's see if other common words?

Another: ""PAG IN"" not? ""pagan"" is P,A,G,A,N → no I? And fails our structure.

""RAJ IN"" not.

""ROBIN"" has R excluded.

""STAIN"" has T excluded? And S? But ""stain"": S(1),T(2),A? No I at position 3? If we put as S,T,A,I,N → then I at position 4? Not matching? We need I at position 3? So ""stain"" has positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)? But A at position 3? Also, A should not be at position 3? From ""crane"" we know A cannot be at position 3? So invalid? And T excluded.

So ""axion"" seems possible? Or ""anion""? ""anion"": A(1),N(2),I(3),O(4),N(5)? But N at position 2? And we have I at position 3? But N is already at position 5? And we don't know about position 2? But ""anion"" is A,N,I,O,N → so has two N's? Position 2: N? But we don't know? And position 5: N? Which we know.

But the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know? So possible.

But ""anion"": 
- A at position 1: allowed? Yes.
- I at position 3: as required? Yes.
- N at position 5: correct? But also N at position 2? Is that possible? We need to check if N can be at position 2.

Well, our deduction is that A must be at position 1 and I at position 3? Let's confirm.

From feedback:
- From ""crane"": A was in position 3 (wrong)? So A not at 3.
- From ""latin"": A was in position 2 (wrong)? So A not at 2.
- From ""divan"": A was in position 4 (wrong)? So A not at 4?
- Since position 5 is N? So A can only be at position 1.

Similarly for I:
- From ""latin"": I was in position 4? Wrong position? So secret word has I but not at position 4.
- From ""divan"": I was in position 2? Wrong position? So secret word has I not at position 2.
- Therefore, I can be at position 1 or 3? But position 1 must be A? So I must be at position 3? Yes.

Therefore, structure: position 1: A, position 3: I, position 5: N? With positions 2 and 4 unknown? And both must not be in the excluded list.

So we have A _ I _ N.

Possible words:
- ""again"": as above, has A(1), G(2), A(3) but we need I at position 3? Not A? ""again"" has A,G,A,I,N? A at position 1, G at 2, A at 3, I at 4, N at 5? But position 3 is A? But we need I at position 3? So doesn't match.

Similarly, ""avion"": not English? Meaning aircraft?

- ""anion"": A(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5) → so anion? Yes, valid? ""anion"" is a word? Meaning negatively charged ion.

Check excluded letters: N? But N is not excluded? We know N is in the word? And at position 5, but here it has N at positions 2 and 5? Duplicate N possible? From previous feedback, we haven't ruled out duplicate letters? So it could be.

Similarly, ""axion"": A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5) → contains X and O? Not excluded.

Other words:
- ""abrin"": A(1),B(2),R? R excluded? Cannot.
- ""actin"": A(1),C? C excluded? Cannot.
- ""admin"": D excluded? Cannot.
- ""aizin""? Not a word.
- ""algid"": ends with D? not N? Or ""algid n"" not.

Common word: ""anion"" or ""axion""? Or perhaps ""tapir"" not ending with N.

Another: ""barin"" not a word.

""Cumin"": but C excluded? And U? Not N? ""cumin"" ends with N? C,U,M,I,N? So C(1),U(2),M(3),I(4),N(5)? But I in position 4? But we need at 3? And C excluded? So invalid.

So valid words: ""anion"" and ""axion""?

But ""anion"" has N at position 2? But we already know N is in the word? And at position 5? But having an extra N? Possible? Yes.

Similarly, ""axion"" might be less common.

But another common word: ""amino""? A,M,I,N,O → positions: A(1), M(2), I(3), N? Position 4 must be N? Then O at 5? But we require N at position 5? So A,M,I,N,O → N at position 4? But position 3 is I? Position 4: N? Then O at 5? But N is at position 4 and 5? ""amino"" is A(1),M(2),I(3),N(4),O(5)? So ends with O? Not N? So not matching? Because we need position 5: N? So this word is A,M,I,N,O → so position 4 is N? Position 5 is O? Not N at end.

But we know the secret word ends with N? So ""amino"" does not end with N? So invalid? Unless we have a word like ""amin n"" not.

But we need the word to end with N? So ""amino"" doesn't work? Similarly, ""amine"" ends with E.

So back to ""anion""?
- ""anion"": A(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5)? Position 5: N? Position 3: I? So it fits? And O not excluded.

Similarly, ""axion"": A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5)? X and O not excluded.

Are there others? Like ""apian""? A,P,I,A,N → positions: A(1),P(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? Also fits? ""apian"" means relating to bees? Valid? But A is also at position 4? But that's allowed? As long as no contradiction.

In our guess, the letter at position 4? We don't have constraint? So A? But the word has two A's? Possible? But we know A is present? Could be duplicate? From feedback? First guess ""crane"" had one A? But we don't know? So possible.

Similarly? Among ""anion"", ""axion"", ""apian""?

But ""apian"" has two A's? But we haven't tested? 

Similarly, ""avian"": A,V,I,A,N → but V excluded? From ""divan"", V is absent? So excluded? So cannot use? Position 2: V? Excluded? So invalid.

Therefore? Candidates: ""anion"", ""axion"", and ""apian""?

But first, we must ensure? Also possible? ""stain"" not? As before.

""Ordin"" not a word? But ""organ"" not end N.

So? We need to choose one.

To maximize information? We have used O in the pattern? But both contain O? ""anion"" and ""axion"" have O? ""apian"" has no O.

But to test? We have not used S? But we don't have a word with S? Since A?I?N? With S? For example, ""ASIAN""? I in position 4? Not allowed? And S? But we need I at position 3? ""Asian"": A,S,I,A,N → positions: A(1),S(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? So this could work? But it has I at position 3? And A at position 1 and 4? So possible? But ""asian"" is valid? But we have duplicate A? But allowed? And S not excluded? So ""asian"" also matches? But wait: in ""asian"", position 4 is A? But from ""divan"", we know that A in position 4 is wrong? For the secret word? Because in ""divan"", A was in position 4 and marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position? So the secret word does not have A in position 4? Therefore, ""asian"" with A in position 4? Cannot be guessed? Because we know A cannot be in position 4? Similarly, we deduced A must be at position 1? So?

For ""asian"": position 4: A? But we concluded A is at position 1? And cannot be at position 4? So ""asian"" would have A at position 1 and 4, but position 4 is disallowed? So it would be invalid.

Therefore, A is at position 1? So we don't want a duplicate at 4? Unless the secret word has two A's? But the position 4 for A? We already tested and got wrong? So no? Secret word has A not in position 4? So if we have a word with A at position 1 and something else at position 4? Like ""a s i o n"" but ""asion"" not word? Or ""anion"" or ""axion"".

Thus? ""asian"" is invalid because of possible duplicate and A in position 4? But if we don't have duplicate? But ""asian"" has A at position 1 and position 4? So position 4 A is disallowed? So secret word cannot have A in position 4? So ""asian"" would be incorrect? So we discard? 

Thus only ""anion"" and ""axion""? Or ""apian""?

""apian"": A,P,I,A,N → positions: A(1),P(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? Position 4: A? But we know from ""divan"" that position 4 cannot have A? Because ""divan"" had A at 4? and it was marked wrong? So the secret word does not have A in position 4? Thus ""apian"" has A at position 4? Cannot be? So we must not guess it.

Therefore, only ""anion"" and ""axion"" do not have A in position 4? They have O and X? And N and O respectively? 

In ""anion"": position 4 is O? Position 2 is N? But we are testing a word that has N at position 2? But we haven't ruled out duplicate N? Possible.

Similarly, ""axion"": position 2 is X, position 4 is O.

So we have two choices? Now, which one to guess? Perhaps ""anion"" is more common? Or we can choose? 

We can also consider ""aspin"" not a word? ""krait"" not ending N.

But let's choose ""anion"" as it uses more common letters? X is less common? 

But actually? In Wordle, both are valid? But perhaps ""anion"" is less obscure? Or ""axion""? 

We might also need to consider that the letter at position 2 and 4 might not be excluded? And we haven't tested O? Or X? 

So to test? We can choose? Since position 2 in ""anion"" is N? But N is already known? So we wouldn't gain information? Whereas in ""axion"", position 2 is new letter X? Position 4 is O? Which is new? 

But we can also consider? We have only tried limited letters? Exclude C,E,R,L,T,D,V? So many left? 

But to maximize information? Perhaps we should guess a word that uses letters not tried? And common? 

Thus? ""anion"" has O? But N is repeated? And we know N? So we wouldn't learn? But it could confirm if duplicate exists? 

But ""axion"" tests X and O? Both new? 

But there is no other common word? How about ""amine"" but E excluded.

I think we should go with ""anion""? Because it is a valid word? And if incorrect? We get information.

Or ""fagin""? But ""fagin"" ends with N? F,A,G,I,N → positions: F(1),A(2),G(3),I(4),N(5)? But A in position 2? Disallowed? And I in position 4? Also disallowed? So invalid.

Similarly? ""BEGIN"" has E? Excluded.

Therefore, we decide between ""anion"" and ""axion"".

Since our deduction requires the pattern A _ I _ N? So let's guess ""anion"".

We can feedback? I think ""anion"" is more common than ""axion"".

But both are valid, so we'll go with ""anion"".

### Step-by-Step Thought Process

1. **Reviewing Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane):**  
     Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)  
     → Eliminates **C, R, E** from the word.  
     → Confirms **A** and **N** are present but not in positions 3 or 4 (A was guessed in position 3, N in position 4).  
   - **Guess 2 (latin):**  
     Feedback: L(x) A(-) T(x) I(-) N(✓)  
     → Eliminates **L, T** (added to exclusions: C, E, R, L, T).  
     → Confirms **N** is in position 5 (fixed).  
     → Confirms **A** is not in position 2 (marked wrong position).  
     → Confirms **I** is present but not in position 4 (marked wrong position).  
   - **Guess 3 (divan):**  
     Feedback: D(x) I(-) V(x) A(-) N(✓)  
     → Eliminates **D, V** (added to exclusions: C, E, R, L, T, D, V).  
     → Confirms **N** in position 5 remains fixed.  
     → **I** is not in position 2 (marked wrong position).  
     → **A** is not in position 4 (marked wrong position).  

2. **Consolidating Position Constraints:**
   - **A**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from guesses 1 and 2), and not in position 4 (from guess 3). Position 5 is N, so **A must be in position 1**.
   - **I**: Cannot be in position 4 (from guess 2) and not in position 2 (from guess 3). With position 1 taken by A and position 5 by N, **I must be in position 3**.
   - **N**: Fixed in position 5.
   - Excluded letters: **C, E, R, L, T, D, V**.
   - Secret word structure: **A (1) ? I (3) ? N (5)**. Positions 2 and 4 need new letters not excluded.

3. **Identifying Remaining Letters:**
   - The word must be a valid English 5-letter word.
   - Available letters (not excluded or tested): **B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z**.
   - Possible words fitting **A ? I ? N**:
     - **anion** (A, N, I, O, N) → Valid (meaning: negatively charged ion), with N at position 2 (duplicate possible) and O at position 4.
     - **axion** (A, X, I, O, N) → Valid (physics term), with X at position 2 and O at position 4.
     - **apian** (A, P, I, A, N) → Invalid—uses A at position 4, but A cannot be in position 4 (from guess 3 feedback).
     - **avian** (A, V, I, A, N) → Invalid—V is excluded.
     - **asian** (A, S, I, A, N) → Invalid—uses A at position 4, barred by feedback.
     - Other tested words like ""admin"" or ""stain"" include excluded letters or mismatched I position.
   - **Final candidates**: **anion** or **axion**.

4. **Selecting the Guess:**
   - Both **anion** and **axion** satisfy all position constraints and avoid excluded letters.
   - **anion** is prioritized as it contains more common letters (O) and includes a duplicate N, which could yield informative feedback if correct or incorrect.
   - Guessing **anion** tests the deduced pattern and leverages feedback efficiently.

<guess>anion</guess>",anion,"We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(absent)
   - Thus, the word contains A and N, but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively (since in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N in position 4).
   - Excluded letters: C, R, E.

2. **latin**: L(absent), A(present but wrong position), T(absent), I(present but wrong position), N(correct position at 5)
   - N is fixed at position 5.
   - A is not at position 2 (since it was guessed there and marked wrong position).
   - I is not at position 4 (marked wrong position).
   - Excluded letters: L, T (added to previous exclusions: C, E, R, L, T).
   - Present letters: A, I, N.

3. **divan**: D(absent), I(present but wrong position), V(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(correct position at 5)
   - D and V are absent, so add to excluded letters: D, V.
   - I is in the word but not at position 2 (since it was in position 2 of ""divan"" and marked '-').
   - A is in the word but not at position 4 (since it was in position 4 and marked '-').

Consolidating:
- **Confirmed positions**: Position 5 is N.
- **Confirmed present letters**: A, I, N (N is at position 5, so we focus on A and I).
- **Letters that must be in the word**: A, I (since they are present).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, L, T, D, V.

Now, constraints on positions:
- A cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from guess 1 and 2), and now also not position 4 (from guess 3). Therefore, A must be in position 1? The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 5 is N, so A can only be in 1 or 4? But now we know A is not in 4? From ""divan"", A was in position 4 and marked '-'? So A is not in position 4. Thus, only position 1 is left for A? So A must be in position 1.

Similarly for I:
- I cannot be in position 4 (from ""latin"") and also not in position 2 (from ""divan""). Therefore, I can be in position 1 or 3? But position 1: if A is there? Conflict? 

Wait, A and I both need positions. Since A must be in position 1? Then what about I? It must be in position 3? Because:
- Positions available: 1,2,3,4,5 (5 is taken by N).
- A: must be 1? Since it can't be 2,3,4? And 5 is taken? So only position 1 for A.
- Then I: cannot be in position 4 (known) and cannot be in position 2 (from ""divan""). So I must be in position 3? Because positions 1 and 2 are excluded for I? Position 1 has A? So I cannot be there? So position 3 is the only option? Then position 2 and 4 are the remaining unknown letters? And we have two unknown letters? Of course, total 5 letters: position 1=A, position 2=?, position 3=I, position 4=?, position 5=N.

Now, the word has form: A ? I ? N

Where ? are the missing letters? But wait, we only have A, I, N, we need two more letters? And we know they are not among the excluded? So letters left? But we haven't tried many.

Also, we know the secret word has exactly these letters? Not exactly? We only know that A, I, N are present? And from tests, we have used only limited letters? But there are two more to be guessed.

Therefore, the word structure is A _ I _ N? And we need to determine the letters at positions 2 and 4? And they must be letters not excluded? Excluded letters: C, E, R, L, T, D, V.

So possible letters: from English alphabet, minus excluded? Common letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to choose two letters? And form a valid English word.

Also, we must avoid positions? For the unknown positions, we don't have known constraints.

Therefore, we have to guess a word that starts with A, has I in position 3, ends with N, and positions 2 and 4 are unknown? With the specified letters.

But now, we also have to ensure that the word has not any excluded letters? And of course, must be a valid English word.

Let's find such words:

Pattern: A ? I ? N

Possible words:
- ""AGAIN"": But ""again"" has G? Positions: A(1), G(2), A(3), I? But no I? ""again"" is A,G,A,I,N? Wait: positions: A(1), G(2), A? No, ""again"" has two A's? Letter at position 3: A? But we need I at position 3? However, the word ""again"" has A at position 3? Not I? And it has I at position 4? But we need I at position 3? So not? ""again"": A(1),G(2),A(3),I(4),N(5) → I is at position 4? But we require I at position 3? So this does not match? We are guessing that I must be at position 3? Based on our deduction? So for our guess, if we believe that, then positions: 1=A, 2=?, 3=I, 4=?, 5=N? Then ""again"" which is A,G,A,I,N would not fit? Because it has I at 4? Not at 3.

Similarly, ""ADMIN"" has D excluded? And M at position 2? And I at position 4? Not at 3? But D excluded? Anyway, doesn't have I at position 3.

""ALIGN"" has L excluded? And L at position 2? And I? Position? ""align"": A(1),L(2),I(3),G(4),N(5)? But L excluded? Cannot use? But if not excluded, it matches? But L is excluded, so invalid? And we know L is absent? So cannot be used.

So find a word: A ? I ? N, with position 3: I? So words like ""AXIOM"" has O? But ends with M? Not N? ""axiom"" is A,X,I,O,M → ends with M? Not N.

""BEGIN"": B,E,G,I,N → E excluded? E is not allowed.

""BITING"": 6 letters? Too long? We need 5-letter.

""CAVIN"": C excluded? Cannot.

Valid words? For example: ""ASPIN""? Not a word? Or ""AVIAN"": A(1),V(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? But V excluded? We tried V? From ""divan"", V is absent? So excluded? Cannot use V.

""HEMIN"": H,E,M,I,N → E excluded.

""KABIN""? Not a word? ""cabin"" has C excluded.

Perhaps ""MAIN"" has only 4.

A common word: ""OPINE"" ends with E? Not N.

Another: ""QUINS"" plural? But ends with S? Not N.

Word like ""AXION"": we considered earlier? A,X,I,O,N → positions: A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). This matches: A at 1, I at 3, N at 5? And X and O? Both not excluded? And is a valid word? (physics term).

So ""axion"" could be a candidate? But let's see if other common words?

Another: ""PAG IN"" not? ""pagan"" is P,A,G,A,N → no I? And fails our structure.

""RAJ IN"" not.

""ROBIN"" has R excluded.

""STAIN"" has T excluded? And S? But ""stain"": S(1),T(2),A? No I at position 3? If we put as S,T,A,I,N → then I at position 4? Not matching? We need I at position 3? So ""stain"" has positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)? But A at position 3? Also, A should not be at position 3? From ""crane"" we know A cannot be at position 3? So invalid? And T excluded.

So ""axion"" seems possible? Or ""anion""? ""anion"": A(1),N(2),I(3),O(4),N(5)? But N at position 2? And we have I at position 3? But N is already at position 5? And we don't know about position 2? But ""anion"" is A,N,I,O,N → so has two N's? Position 2: N? But we don't know? And position 5: N? Which we know.

But the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know? So possible.

But ""anion"": 
- A at position 1: allowed? Yes.
- I at position 3: as required? Yes.
- N at position 5: correct? But also N at position 2? Is that possible? We need to check if N can be at position 2.

Well, our deduction is that A must be at position 1 and I at position 3? Let's confirm.

From feedback:
- From ""crane"": A was in position 3 (wrong)? So A not at 3.
- From ""latin"": A was in position 2 (wrong)? So A not at 2.
- From ""divan"": A was in position 4 (wrong)? So A not at 4?
- Since position 5 is N? So A can only be at position 1.

Similarly for I:
- From ""latin"": I was in position 4? Wrong position? So secret word has I but not at position 4.
- From ""divan"": I was in position 2? Wrong position? So secret word has I not at position 2.
- Therefore, I can be at position 1 or 3? But position 1 must be A? So I must be at position 3? Yes.

Therefore, structure: position 1: A, position 3: I, position 5: N? With positions 2 and 4 unknown? And both must not be in the excluded list.

So we have A _ I _ N.

Possible words:
- ""again"": as above, has A(1), G(2), A(3) but we need I at position 3? Not A? ""again"" has A,G,A,I,N? A at position 1, G at 2, A at 3, I at 4, N at 5? But position 3 is A? But we need I at position 3? So doesn't match.

Similarly, ""avion"": not English? Meaning aircraft?

- ""anion"": A(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5) → so anion? Yes, valid? ""anion"" is a word? Meaning negatively charged ion.

Check excluded letters: N? But N is not excluded? We know N is in the word? And at position 5, but here it has N at positions 2 and 5? Duplicate N possible? From previous feedback, we haven't ruled out duplicate letters? So it could be.

Similarly, ""axion"": A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5) → contains X and O? Not excluded.

Other words:
- ""abrin"": A(1),B(2),R? R excluded? Cannot.
- ""actin"": A(1),C? C excluded? Cannot.
- ""admin"": D excluded? Cannot.
- ""aizin""? Not a word.
- ""algid"": ends with D? not N? Or ""algid n"" not.

Common word: ""anion"" or ""axion""? Or perhaps ""tapir"" not ending with N.

Another: ""barin"" not a word.

""Cumin"": but C excluded? And U? Not N? ""cumin"" ends with N? C,U,M,I,N? So C(1),U(2),M(3),I(4),N(5)? But I in position 4? But we need at 3? And C excluded? So invalid.

So valid words: ""anion"" and ""axion""?

But ""anion"" has N at position 2? But we already know N is in the word? And at position 5? But having an extra N? Possible? Yes.

Similarly, ""axion"" might be less common.

But another common word: ""amino""? A,M,I,N,O → positions: A(1), M(2), I(3), N? Position 4 must be N? Then O at 5? But we require N at position 5? So A,M,I,N,O → N at position 4? But position 3 is I? Position 4: N? Then O at 5? But N is at position 4 and 5? ""amino"" is A(1),M(2),I(3),N(4),O(5)? So ends with O? Not N? So not matching? Because we need position 5: N? So this word is A,M,I,N,O → so position 4 is N? Position 5 is O? Not N at end.

But we know the secret word ends with N? So ""amino"" does not end with N? So invalid? Unless we have a word like ""amin n"" not.

But we need the word to end with N? So ""amino"" doesn't work? Similarly, ""amine"" ends with E.

So back to ""anion""?
- ""anion"": A(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5)? Position 5: N? Position 3: I? So it fits? And O not excluded.

Similarly, ""axion"": A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5)? X and O not excluded.

Are there others? Like ""apian""? A,P,I,A,N → positions: A(1),P(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? Also fits? ""apian"" means relating to bees? Valid? But A is also at position 4? But that's allowed? As long as no contradiction.

In our guess, the letter at position 4? We don't have constraint? So A? But the word has two A's? Possible? But we know A is present? Could be duplicate? From feedback? First guess ""crane"" had one A? But we don't know? So possible.

Similarly? Among ""anion"", ""axion"", ""apian""?

But ""apian"" has two A's? But we haven't tested? 

Similarly, ""avian"": A,V,I,A,N → but V excluded? From ""divan"", V is absent? So excluded? So cannot use? Position 2: V? Excluded? So invalid.

Therefore? Candidates: ""anion"", ""axion"", and ""apian""?

But first, we must ensure? Also possible? ""stain"" not? As before.

""Ordin"" not a word? But ""organ"" not end N.

So? We need to choose one.

To maximize information? We have used O in the pattern? But both contain O? ""anion"" and ""axion"" have O? ""apian"" has no O.

But to test? We have not used S? But we don't have a word with S? Since A?I?N? With S? For example, ""ASIAN""? I in position 4? Not allowed? And S? But we need I at position 3? ""Asian"": A,S,I,A,N → positions: A(1),S(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? So this could work? But it has I at position 3? And A at position 1 and 4? So possible? But ""asian"" is valid? But we have duplicate A? But allowed? And S not excluded? So ""asian"" also matches? But wait: in ""asian"", position 4 is A? But from ""divan"", we know that A in position 4 is wrong? For the secret word? Because in ""divan"", A was in position 4 and marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position? So the secret word does not have A in position 4? Therefore, ""asian"" with A in position 4? Cannot be guessed? Because we know A cannot be in position 4? Similarly, we deduced A must be at position 1? So?

For ""asian"": position 4: A? But we concluded A is at position 1? And cannot be at position 4? So ""asian"" would have A at position 1 and 4, but position 4 is disallowed? So it would be invalid.

Therefore, A is at position 1? So we don't want a duplicate at 4? Unless the secret word has two A's? But the position 4 for A? We already tested and got wrong? So no? Secret word has A not in position 4? So if we have a word with A at position 1 and something else at position 4? Like ""a s i o n"" but ""asion"" not word? Or ""anion"" or ""axion"".

Thus? ""asian"" is invalid because of possible duplicate and A in position 4? But if we don't have duplicate? But ""asian"" has A at position 1 and position 4? So position 4 A is disallowed? So secret word cannot have A in position 4? So ""asian"" would be incorrect? So we discard? 

Thus only ""anion"" and ""axion""? Or ""apian""?

""apian"": A,P,I,A,N → positions: A(1),P(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? Position 4: A? But we know from ""divan"" that position 4 cannot have A? Because ""divan"" had A at 4? and it was marked wrong? So the secret word does not have A in position 4? Thus ""apian"" has A at position 4? Cannot be? So we must not guess it.

Therefore, only ""anion"" and ""axion"" do not have A in position 4? They have O and X? And N and O respectively? 

In ""anion"": position 4 is O? Position 2 is N? But we are testing a word that has N at position 2? But we haven't ruled out duplicate N? Possible.

Similarly, ""axion"": position 2 is X, position 4 is O.

So we have two choices? Now, which one to guess? Perhaps ""anion"" is more common? Or we can choose? 

We can also consider ""aspin"" not a word? ""krait"" not ending N.

But let's choose ""anion"" as it uses more common letters? X is less common? 

But actually? In Wordle, both are valid? But perhaps ""anion"" is less obscure? Or ""axion""? 

We might also need to consider that the letter at position 2 and 4 might not be excluded? And we haven't tested O? Or X? 

So to test? We can choose? Since position 2 in ""anion"" is N? But N is already known? So we wouldn't gain information? Whereas in ""axion"", position 2 is new letter X? Position 4 is O? Which is new? 

But we can also consider? We have only tried limited letters? Exclude C,E,R,L,T,D,V? So many left? 

But to maximize information? Perhaps we should guess a word that uses letters not tried? And common? 

Thus? ""anion"" has O? But N is repeated? And we know N? So we wouldn't learn? But it could confirm if duplicate exists? 

But ""axion"" tests X and O? Both new? 

But there is no other common word? How about ""amine"" but E excluded.

I think we should go with ""anion""? Because it is a valid word? And if incorrect? We get information.

Or ""fagin""? But ""fagin"" ends with N? F,A,G,I,N → positions: F(1),A(2),G(3),I(4),N(5)? But A in position 2? Disallowed? And I in position 4? Also disallowed? So invalid.

Similarly? ""BEGIN"" has E? Excluded.

Therefore, we decide between ""anion"" and ""axion"".

Since our deduction requires the pattern A _ I _ N? So let's guess ""anion"".

We can feedback? I think ""anion"" is more common than ""axion"".

But both are valid, so we'll go with ""anion"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process

1. **Reviewing Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane):**  
     Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)  
     → Eliminates **C, R, E** from the word.  
     → Confirms **A** and **N** are present but not in positions 3 or 4 (A was guessed in position 3, N in position 4).  
   - **Guess 2 (latin):**  
     Feedback: L(x) A(-) T(x) I(-) N(✓)  
     → Eliminates **L, T** (added to exclusions: C, E, R, L, T).  
     → Confirms **N** is in position 5 (fixed).  
     → Confirms **A** is not in position 2 (marked wrong position).  
     → Confirms **I** is present but not in position 4 (marked wrong position).  
   - **Guess 3 (divan):**  
     Feedback: D(x) I(-) V(x) A(-) N(✓)  
     → Eliminates **D, V** (added to exclusions: C, E, R, L, T, D, V).  
     → Confirms **N** in position 5 remains fixed.  
     → **I** is not in position 2 (marked wrong position).  
     → **A** is not in position 4 (marked wrong position).  

2. **Consolidating Position Constraints:**
   - **A**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from guesses 1 and 2), and not in position 4 (from guess 3). Position 5 is N, so **A must be in position 1**.
   - **I**: Cannot be in position 4 (from guess 2) and not in position 2 (from guess 3). With position 1 taken by A and position 5 by N, **I must be in position 3**.
   - **N**: Fixed in position 5.
   - Excluded letters: **C, E, R, L, T, D, V**.
   - Secret word structure: **A (1) ? I (3) ? N (5)**. Positions 2 and 4 need new letters not excluded.

3. **Identifying Remaining Letters:**
   - The word must be a valid English 5-letter word.
   - Available letters (not excluded or tested): **B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z**.
   - Possible words fitting **A ? I ? N**:
     - **anion** (A, N, I, O, N) → Valid (meaning: negatively charged ion), with N at position 2 (duplicate possible) and O at position 4.
     - **axion** (A, X, I, O, N) → Valid (physics term), with X at position 2 and O at position 4.
     - **apian** (A, P, I, A, N) → Invalid—uses A at position 4, but A cannot be in position 4 (from guess 3 feedback).
     - **avian** (A, V, I, A, N) → Invalid—V is excluded.
     - **asian** (A, S, I, A, N) → Invalid—uses A at position 4, barred by feedback.
     - Other tested words like ""admin"" or ""stain"" include excluded letters or mismatched I position.
   - **Final candidates**: **anion** or **axion**.

4. **Selecting the Guess:**
   - Both **anion** and **axion** satisfy all position constraints and avoid excluded letters.
   - **anion** is prioritized as it contains more common letters (O) and includes a duplicate N, which could yield informative feedback if correct or incorrect.
   - Guessing **anion** tests the deduced pattern and leverages feedback efficiently.",Guess 4: anion -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(-) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,AXION,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has:
   - Common letters (vowels and frequent consonants) to maximize information.
   - Avoid repeating letters to cover more distinct letters.

 Some effective starting words in Wordle are: ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose one that includes two vowels and three consonants, and avoid rare letters.

 I'll go with ""CRANE"". It has the letters: C, R, A, N, E. These are common letters.

 Therefore, my first guess will be ""CRANE"".

 But note: the problem says the word must be a valid 5-letter English word. ""CRANE"" is valid.I'm starting the game and need my first guess. Since I have no prior feedback, I should choose a word that maximizes information gain. Ideal starter words include common vowels (like A and E) and frequent consonants (like R, S, T). Words like ""CRANE,"" ""SLATE,"" or ""ROAST"" work well. I'll choose ""CRANE"" because it covers three consonants (C, R, N) and two vowels (A, E), helping identify multiple potential matches.

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
  C: x (not in the word)
  R: x (not in the word)
  A: - (in the word but wrong position)
  N: - (in the word but wrong position)
  E: x (not in the word)

So, we know:
- The secret word contains the letters A and N, but not in the positions they were in ""crane"". Since A was in position 3 and N in position 4, they cannot be in those positions in the secret word.
- The letters C, R, and E are not in the word at all.

We must avoid using C, R, E in our next guess.

We also know that A and N are present, so our next guess must include A and N, but not in the 3rd and 4th positions respectively.

We have 6 tries, so we want to make a guess that uses common letters and avoids the excluded ones (C, R, E) and also avoids putting A in position 3 and N in position 4.

We can also consider that the word might have other common letters. Since we have two known letters (A and N), we can try to use them in different positions and also introduce new common letters to test.

Possible positions for A: it cannot be in position 3. So it can be in 1, 2, 4, or 5.
Similarly, N cannot be in position 4, so it can be in 1, 2, 3, or 5.

We should also avoid using the same positions for A and N as in the first guess because we know they are wrong.

We can look for words that have A and N, and also include other common letters (like S, T, L, I, O, D, H, etc.) but avoid C, R, E.

Let's think of words that have A and N, and are 5 letters.

We can try to put A in position 1 and N in position 2? But we don't know. We need to test.

Alternatively, we can use a word that has A and N in positions that we haven't tried and also include other letters we haven't tested.

We have not tested the letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.

Common letters in English: S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Let's try to form a word that includes A and N and three new common letters.

Possible words:

- ""saint"": S, A, I, N, T -> but A is in position 2 and N in position 4? Wait, let's break it:
  S (1), A (2), I (3), N (4), T (5)
  However, in the feedback, we know that A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and that was wrong. But in this word, A is in position 2, which is allowed. Similarly, N was in position 4 in the first guess and that was wrong, but in this word, N is in position 4 again? That would be the same position as before, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put N in position 4.

Therefore, we must avoid putting N in position 4. So ""saint"" is invalid because N is in position 4.

We need a word where N is not in position 4 and A is not in position 3.

Another word: ""stand"" -> S, T, A, N, D
Positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5)
But A is in position 3? We know from feedback that A cannot be in position 3. So that's invalid.

Another word: ""tansy"" (a plant) -> T, A, N, S, Y
Positions: T(1), A(2), N(3), S(4), Y(5)
This avoids position 3 for A (A is in 2) and position 4 for N (N is in 3). So that's acceptable.

But we are not sure if ""tansy"" is common. We can try more common words.

Another word: ""plain"" -> P, L, A, I, N
Positions: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)
But A is in position 3? That's the same as the first guess and we know it's wrong. So invalid.

We need to avoid position 3 for A.

How about ""panel""? But E is excluded, so we cannot use E.

We cannot use E.

Another word: ""manic"" -> M, A, N, I, C -> but C is excluded. So no.

We must avoid C, R, E.

Another word: ""sandy"" -> S, A, N, D, Y
Positions: S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5)
This is good because A is in 2 (not 3) and N is in 3 (not 4). Also, we are testing S, A, N, D, Y.

But we have to make sure it's a valid word. ""sandy"" is a valid word.

Alternatively, ""handy"": H, A, N, D, Y -> A in position 2, N in position 3. Also valid.

We can also consider ""latin"" but L, A, T, I, N -> A in position 2, N in position 5. That's acceptable because N is not in 4. But we have to check the positions: 
Position 1: L (new)
Position 2: A (allowed)
Position 3: T (new)
Position 4: I (new)
Position 5: N (allowed, since previously N was in 4 and that was wrong, but 5 is new)

So ""latin"" is acceptable.

But we are testing more letters with ""latin"": L, T, I, and we already know A and N.

We can also consider ""piano"", but that has O and is 5 letters? P-I-A-N-O -> but that has O, and we haven't tested O. However, we are limited by the known letters.

But note: we are trying to find the secret word, and we know it has A and N. We also want to test as many new letters as possible.

Another common word: ""stain"" -> S, T, A, I, N -> but A is in position 3? That's not allowed. So no.

""train"" has R and we know R is excluded.

""plain"" has A in position 3 and we cannot use that.

How about ""adorn""? But that's 5 letters? A, D, O, R, N -> but R is excluded, so no.

We must avoid R.

Another word: ""daunt"" -> D, A, U, N, T -> positions: D(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), T(5)
But N is in position 4? We know that N cannot be in position 4 because in the first guess it was in 4 and was wrong. So we cannot use N in position 4. Therefore, ""daunt"" is invalid.

We need to avoid putting N in position 4.

Let me try to list words that have A and N, and avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N, and avoid C, R, E.

Possible words:

- ""sandy"": S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> N is in 3, which is new. A is in 2, which is new.
- ""handy"": H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> same as above but with H.
- ""latin"": L(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), N(5) -> A in 2, N in 5 (new positions).
- ""mania"": M(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5) -> but we have two A's? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know. Also, we are testing M, A, N, I. But A is in 2 and 5? We know A is at least once in the word, but maybe twice? We don't have information. However, we are allowed to guess duplicate letters. But in this case, we are testing only 4 distinct letters: M, A, N, I. And we are using A twice.

But we don't know if the word has two A's. It might be inefficient.

Another word: ""paint"" -> P, A, I, N, T -> positions: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but N is in position 4? That's not allowed. So invalid.

""taint"": T, A, I, N, T -> A in position 2, N in position 4 -> invalid because of N in 4.

""nasty"": N, A, S, T, Y -> positions: N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). This is acceptable because A is in 2 (not 3) and N is in 1 (not 4). So we can use ""nasty"".

But note: we are putting N in position 1, which we haven't tried before. And A in 2.

We can also consider ""salsa"" but that has two S's and no N? We need to include N.

We must include both A and N.

After considering, I think ""latin"" is a good choice because it tests L, T, I and places A and N in new positions.

But let's see the feedback we got: we have A and N in the word, so we are trying to find their correct positions and also discover other letters.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't put A and N in the same positions as before and uses common letters.

I'll go with ""latin"": 
  L (new), A (in word but not in position 3, so we put in 2), T (new), I (new), N (in word but not in position 4, so we put in 5).

This way, we test three new letters and the positions for A and N.

So my next guess is ""latin"".

But note: we are not forced to use both known letters. However, we know the word has A and N, so if we don't include them, we might waste a guess. It's better to include them to get more information about their positions.

Therefore, I choose ""latin"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").
- A and N **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:
  - A cannot be in position 3 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").
  - N cannot be in position 4 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").

For the next guess:
- Must include **A** and **N** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A in position 3 or N in position 4.
- Must **avoid** using C, R, or E.
- Should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, I, D, O) to maximize information.

After evaluating options, ""latin"" is a strong choice:
- **L** (new), **A** (in position 2, avoiding position 3), **T** (new), **I** (new), **N** (in position 5, avoiding position 4).
- Tests three new common letters (L, T, I) while respecting the known constraints for A and N.

<guess>latin</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: latin -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(x) I(-) N(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess ""crane"":
   - C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)
   → So, letters C, R, E are not in the secret word.
   → A and N are in the word but in wrong positions. Specifically, A was in position 3 and N in position 4 of ""crane"", so the secret word has A but not in position 3, and N but not in position 4.

2. Guess ""latin"":
   - L(x), A(-), T(x), I(-), N(✓)
   → L and T are not in the word (since x).
   → A is in the word but not in position 2 (since it showed as '-' for position 2 in ""latin"").
   → I is in the word but not in position 4 (since '-' for position 4).
   → N is correct in position 5 (since ✓). So the secret word has N as the fifth letter.

From guess 2, we know:
   - The secret word ends with N (position 5).
   - A is in the word, but not at position 2 (and also not at position 3, from previous guess).
   - I is in the word, but not at position 4.

Also, we know the secret word has A, I, and N (from the two feedbacks). And N is fixed at position 5.

Now, let's consolidate known information:
- Position 5: N (fixed)
- Excluded letters: C, R, E, L, T (from both guesses, all marked x)
- Present letters (must be in the word): A, I, and of course N (but N is already placed).
- A cannot be in position 2 or 3.
- I cannot be in position 4.

Since N is at position 5, the word is _ _ _ _ N.

We have two more letters to discover (since the word is 5 letters and we only know A and I are in it, but there are two more we haven't found because we only have A, I, N so far, and we need five letters).

We know the word contains A, I, and N. Since we have three confirmed letters (A, I, N) and the word is five letters, there are two more letters we haven't identified yet.

We have tested the following letters: C, R, A, N, E (first guess) and L, A, T, I, N (second guess). So the letters we have tested and are excluded: C, R, E, L, T.

We need to choose a word that:
1. Has N at the end (position 5).
2. Contains A and I (and two other letters we haven't tried).
3. A is not in position 2 or 3 (and also not in position 5 because that's N). So A can only be in position 1 or 4? The positions in the word: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 5 is taken by N. So A can be in position 1 or 4? But note: from ""latin"", A was in position 2 (and was wrong) and from ""crane"" in position 3 (wrong). So A cannot be in 2 or 3. Position 5 is N, so indeed A can only be in position 1 or 4.

Similarly, I is not in position 4? Wait, in ""latin"", I was in position 4 and it was marked '-', meaning it is present but not in that position. So I cannot be in position 4. Also, we don't know about other positions. So I can be in 1,2, or 3? But position 5 is N.

So:
- Position for A: only 1 or 4.
- Position for I: only 1,2,3 (but 5 is taken).

Now, if A is in position 1, that leaves I in position 2 or 3? Or if A is in position 4, then I can be in 1,2,3.

We also have two other letters to include.

We need to avoid the excluded letters: C, E, R, L, T.

We should use common letters not tried: for example, S, O, D, M, P, U, B, etc.

Let me try to think of words ending in N and containing A and I.

First, if A is in position 1: then we have A _ _ _ N. And the word must contain I and two other letters.

Possible words: 
- ""ADMIN"" but D, M are new? But ""admin"" is a common word. However, we have to check: 
  - A at 1? Allowed.
  - I: must be in the word, and in ""admin"", I is at position 4? But wait, position 4: I? But we cannot put I in position 4 because feedback says it's not in that position? Wait, in ""latin"", I was in position 4 and it was marked '-', meaning I is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put I in position 4 in a new word, it would be incorrect? Actually, no: the secret word cannot have I in position 4. So in ""admin"", if we try it, and I is in position 4, that would contradict because we know I cannot be at position 4.

Therefore, ""admin"" is invalid because it has I at position 4, which is disallowed.

Similarly, other words: e.g., ""AKING"" is not a word.

""AVAIL"" but ends with L and L is excluded? Also L is excluded, so we cannot use L.

How about ""ASIAN""? Let's check:
  A in position 1? Allowed.
  I: must be in the word. In ""asian"", I is in position 4? Again position 4, which is disallowed. So invalid.

Position for I must be 1,2,3 only. Since position 5 is N and position 4 cannot hold I.

Therefore, if A is in 1 and I in 2 or 3.

For example, ""ALIEN"" but E is excluded and L excluded? And it has E? E is not allowed.

We must avoid E.

Another possibility: ""AMINO"" but O? ""amino"" is a word. But:
  A at position 1? Allowed.
  I: at position 3? That's allowed because position 3 is okay for I? (Yes, since we only know it can't be in position 4).
  But the word ends with O, not N? ""amino"" ends with O? We need to end with N. So not.

Now, other pattern: A in position 4? Then the word is _ _ _ A N.

And I must be in one of positions 1,2,3.

So the word would be _ _ _ A N.

And I can be at 1,2, or 3.

Also, we have two other letters.

Common words: e.g., ""URBAN"" but U and B? But avoids exclusions? 
  U(1), R? R is excluded. So cannot use R.

""Human""? H, U, M, A, N -> but M is allowed? However, U? But E is excluded, R is excluded, but R not here. However, ""human"" has H, U, M, A, N. R is not used, but wait: in first guess R is excluded so we cannot use R? Actually, in ""urban"" we saw R excluded. So ""urban"" not allowed. For ""human"": no excluded letters? We excluded C, R, E, L, T. So H, U, M are new and okay.

But in ""human"", I is not present? The word must contain I? We know I must be in the word. ""human"" has H,U,M,A,N — no I. So we cannot guess that because I is missing.

We must include I.

So words ending with AN and containing I.

For example, ""urban"" has R excluded.

""ROBIN"" has R excluded.

""VIXEN"" has E and X? E excluded.

""CHAIR"" has R and C? Excluded.

A better idea: let's list common words ending with N and containing A and I, and avoid excluded letters.

Excluded: C, E, R, L, T

We can use: S, O, D, M, P, U, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Possible words:

- ""SABIN"" (like vaccine) - S,A,B,I,N → forms: S(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), N(5). But note: I is in position 4? We know I cannot be in position 4, because from ""latin"" feedback, I was in position 4 and marked '-' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put I in position 4. Thus, ""sabin"" would be invalid because it puts I in position 4.

- ""PAIN"" — that's 4 letters, we need 5.

Another: ""MAINS"" — but that ends with S? We need ending with N.

Perhaps ""KIWAN"" — not a valid word.

How about ""DEVIN""? But E excluded? E is excluded.

""BLIND"" — ends with D? Not N.

Perhaps ""BRAIN"" — has R, excluded.

""DAISY"" — ends with Y? Not N.

This is tricky.

Another pattern: A in position 4. So the word is ... A N at end. And I must be in position 1,2, or 3.

For example: a word like X X I A N -> positions: 1,2,3,4,5: N already set. So [1][2][3] A N.

And I at 1,2, or 3.

For instance, ""VIXEN"" -> V, I, X, E, N -> but E excluded and ends with N? X and E is excluded? E is excluded, so invalid.

""ANIM U"" — not 5 letters.

Perhaps ""OXBOW"" — no I and no A? And not ending with N.

Let's think: ""BASIN"" -> B, A, S, I, N -> but I is at position 4? Not allowed. 
Similarly, ""ROSIN"" has R excluded.

How about ""MAIDEN""? Too long.

5-letter? ""OCTAN"" not a common word.

Another: ""ADMIN"" we already saw has I in position 4? ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N → I is at position 4? Disallowed.

But we need I not in position 4.

So maybe I in position 2 or 3.

For example, with A at 4: 
- Position 1: put I? Then I(1), then position 2,3 are new letters, A(4), N(5). So I _ _ A N.

But can we have I at position 1? We don't know until we try.

For instance: ""IRAQ N"" not valid.

""ISL AN"" but L excluded and not a word.

""IMAGN"" not a word.

Maybe without I at 1? With I at position 2: for example, X I X A N.

And no excluded letters.

So for position 1, we can put S: ""S I T A N"" but T is excluded? T is marked x in second guess. So we cannot use T.

Similarly, D: ""D I V A N"" → DIVAN is a word? D(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), N(5). This might work. Avoiding excluded letters: D, V not excluded? Only C,E,R,L,T excluded.

So DIVAN: 
- D not tested, 
- I: in position 2? We have no information that I cannot be at position 2? We only know it cannot be at position 4. So position 2 is allowed.
- V new, 
- A in position 4: and we said A can be in position 4? Yes.
- N at 5.

So DIVAN could be a guess.

Similarly, ""P I C A N"" but C excluded? Or ""WICAN"" not a word.

Another word: ""W I D A N"" not a word.

""DIVAN"" seems valid.

But is ""divan"" common? It means a sofa.

We could try ""S I M A N"" but not a word? We have ""simian"" but that's 6 letters? Simian is 6? S-I-M-I-A-N, 6 letters.

No, 5-letter: SIMAN is not a valid word.

Other possibilities: ""B I D A N"" not a word.

""IVYAN"" not a word.

So ""divan"" is a possibility.

Another structure: A not in position 4, but in position 1? Earlier we considered.

Position 1: A, and then I at position 3? So A _ I _ N.

With position 2 and 4 are new.

Words: ""ALIGN"" but L excluded and G? L excluded.

""AXION"": A, X, I, O, N → positions: A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). This seems good. 
- A at position 1: allowed.
- I at position 3: we have no restriction against position 3 for I? Only position 4 is forbidden. 
- Avoids excluded letters? X, O not excluded? Only C,E,R,L,T excluded.

""Axion"" is a word (physics term).

So ""axion"" could be another guess.

We also have ""avion"" but that's French, usually ""avion"" is not English word? We need English word. ""Axion"" is English.

Similarly, ""PRION"" has R excluded.

""DENIM"" ends with M? Not N.

So possibilities: ""divan"" or ""axion"".

But ""axion"" tests more common letters? X is less common.

We can also consider ""admin"" but invalid because of I in position 4.

Another common word: ""RAIN"" has only 4.

We already have ""divan"" and ""axion"".

But let's see if there is a better word? We want to test common letters.

Letters not tested: S has not been tested? We haven't used S.

In first guess: crane had no S.
Second guess: latin had no S.

Similarly, O, D, M, P, U, B, G, H, Y, etc.

So perhaps we should include S to test.

Why not a word with S and O or something.

For example, with A in position 1 and I in position 3? We have A _ I _ N.

So positions: [1]=A, [3]=I, [5]=N, then [2] and [4] to fill.

We need to choose two letters. Avoid excluded C,E,R,L,T.

Possible: [2]=S, [4]=O? Then ""ASION""? But ""asion"" is not a word.

[2]=O, [4]=S: ""A O I S N"" → ""aoisn"" not a word.

[2]=M, [4]=S: ""AMIS N"" → ""amiss"" ends with SS? Not N.

N is at 5.

Another: [2]=D, [4]=O: ""ADION"" not a word.

""ADMIN"" becomes invalid.

Perhaps with A in position 4.

As before: _ _ _ A N, with I in one of the first three.

And including S.

For example: position 1=S, position 2=I, position 3=O, then ""S I O A N"" → ""sion a n""? Not a word.

Position 1=O, position 2=I, position 3=S: ""O I S A N"" → ""o is a n"" not a word.

Perhaps ""DAISY"" does not end with N.

But we have ""doing"" not end with N.

Another word: ""SPAIN"" has P, but I at position 4? ""spain"": S(1), P(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). 
But:
- A is at position 3? From first guess with ""crane"", A in position 3 was wrong. We cannot put A in position 3. So ""spain"" would have A in position 3, invalid.

Similarly, ""train"" has R.

""MAINS"" is M,A,I,N,S → ends with S? S is at position 5 but we need position 5=N.

So not.

Considering ""divan"" and ""axion"", both are valid and satisfy the constraints.

Alternatively, ""damn"" is 4 letters.

""Pagan"" ends with N? G,A,N → but pag a n? P A G A N -> that has two A's? And it ends with N? But we don't know if duplicate letters are allowed? We don't have information against that.

""pagan"": P(1), A(2), G(3), A(4), N(5). But note: A is in position 2, which from ""latin"" we know A cannot be in position 2 (because in ""latin"" A was in position 2 and marked '-', meaning it is in the word but wrong position). So we cannot put A in position 2? Exactly.

In ""pagan"", A is in position 2: that is disallowed because we already tried A in position 2 and it was not correct.

Similarly, A is in position 4? Which is okay? But the word has two A's? Possibly? But position 4 for A is allowed because we haven't tried it? The only positions A cannot be are 2 and 3.

So ""Pagan"": 
- Position 1: P
- Position 2: A (not allowed because we know from guess 2 that position 2 has A and it was wrong)
- Position 3: G
- Position 4: A (allowed, because we haven't tried position 4 yet)
- Position 5: N

But in the word ""pagan"", position 2 also has A? However, the feedback would show for position 2: A in position 2 is disallowed? Specifically, we know from ""latin"" that when we put A in position 2, it was incorrect. Therefore, we cannot use that in a new word? Unless we are testing for duplicate: the word might have two A's? But position 2 cannot have A because we already know it's wrong.

So when we say 'disallowed', it means that in the secret word, position 2 is not A? Because it was tried and marked as wrong position. So the secret word does not have A in position 2.

Therefore, ""pagan"" would be invalid for guess because it puts A in position 2.

So we discard.

Back to ""divan"" or ""axion"".

Since we haven't tested S, perhaps we can look for a word that includes S and avoids positions.

For example, if A is in position 4, then we have _ _ _ A N.

And I in position 1,2, or 3.

With S? For example, ""USN IA N"" not a word.

"" MAS A N"" with I? e.g., ""MAJOR"" not ending with N.

Another common ending: ""woman"" W O M A N? Ends with N? That's a valid word: W(1), O(2), M(3), A(4), N(5). 
- And we have A at position 4: allowed.
- Does it have I? No, ""woman"" has no I? But we must include I? The secret word has I? From feedback: in ""latin"", I was marked in the word (since '-')? Yes, I is in the secret word. But ""woman"" has W,O,M,A,N — no I. So we cannot choose it.

Similarly, ""human"" no I.

So we must have a word with I.

Now, let's try to find words like ""vista n"" not.

Perhaps ""divan"" is the best choice? Or ""axion"".

But to maximize information, we can choose a word that has more common letters? ""divan"" has D, I, V, A, N; we know A and N, but D and V are new. And I is tested for position 2.

Similarly, ""axion"" has A, X, I, O, N; X is less common? But O is common.

Another idea: ""SHIN"" is 4 letters.

""Begin"" has G? ""begin"" B,E,G,I,N → but E excluded? E is excluded.

""piano"" not ending in N.

I think our best bets are ""divan"" or ""axion"". We can also consider ""diana"" but ends with A? Not with N.

Let's choose ""divan"": D, I, V, A, N → positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:V, 4:A, 5:N.

This satisfies:
- N at 5.
- A at position 4: which is allowed (A can be at 1 or 4).
- I at position 2: we have no restriction against position 2? Only that I cannot be at position 4? So position 2 is okay.
- Avoids excluded letters: no C,E,R,L,T.

So guess ""divan"".

Alternatively, to test more vowels? ""axion"" might be less common.

Another word: ""rabid"" not ending with N.

Perhaps ""koine"" but E excluded.

So I'll go with ""divan"".After reviewing the feedback:
- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
  → This eliminates C, R, E as possible letters.  
  → Confirms A and N are in the secret word, but not in positions 3 or 4 (since A was guessed in position 3 and N in position 4, both marked wrong).
  
- **Guess 2: latin**  
  Feedback: L(x), A(-), T(x), I(-), N(✓)  
  → This eliminates L and T as possible letters.  
  → Confirms A is not in position 2 (as it was marked wrong here), and I is not in position 4 (marked wrong) but is present in the word.  
  → Confirms N is in position 5 (✓ in position 5).

**Consolidated Insights**:
- Secret word contains: **A**, **I**, and **N** (with **N** fixed at position 5).
- The word ends with **N** (position 5).
- **A** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from previous feedback).
- **I** cannot be in position 4 (from previous feedback).
- Excluded letters: **C, E, R, L, T**.
- Known letter positions:  
Position 5: **N** (confirmed).  
A must be in position 1 or 4 (only available options since positions 2/3 are invalid, and position 5 is taken by N).  
I must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (only options since position 4/5 are invalid/taken).  
- Need to identify two additional letters for the unknown positions (since only A, I, and N are confirmed).

For the next guess, the word **DIVAN** is chosen because it:  
- Includes **A** (in position 4, allowed) and **I** (in position 2, allowed).  
- Includes N at position 5 (confirmed).  
- Uses new common letters (**D** and **V**) not tested before.  
- Avoids all excluded letters (C, E, R, L, T).  
- Tests potential positions for A (position 4) and I (position 2).  
- Is a valid English word meaning a type of sofa or council chamber.  

This guess will help narrow down the possible letters and positions further.

<guess>divan</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)
Guess 2: latin -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(x) I(-) N(✓)
Guess 3: divan -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(-) V(x) A(-) N(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from three guesses:

1. **crane**: C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(absent)
   - Thus, the word contains A and N, but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively (since in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N in position 4).
   - Excluded letters: C, R, E.

2. **latin**: L(absent), A(present but wrong position), T(absent), I(present but wrong position), N(correct position at 5)
   - N is fixed at position 5.
   - A is not at position 2 (since it was guessed there and marked wrong position).
   - I is not at position 4 (marked wrong position).
   - Excluded letters: L, T (added to previous exclusions: C, E, R, L, T).
   - Present letters: A, I, N.

3. **divan**: D(absent), I(present but wrong position), V(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(correct position at 5)
   - D and V are absent, so add to excluded letters: D, V.
   - I is in the word but not at position 2 (since it was in position 2 of ""divan"" and marked '-').
   - A is in the word but not at position 4 (since it was in position 4 and marked '-').

Consolidating:
- **Confirmed positions**: Position 5 is N.
- **Confirmed present letters**: A, I, N (N is at position 5, so we focus on A and I).
- **Letters that must be in the word**: A, I (since they are present).
- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, L, T, D, V.

Now, constraints on positions:
- A cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from guess 1 and 2), and now also not position 4 (from guess 3). Therefore, A must be in position 1? The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 5 is N, so A can only be in 1 or 4? But now we know A is not in 4? From ""divan"", A was in position 4 and marked '-'? So A is not in position 4. Thus, only position 1 is left for A? So A must be in position 1.

Similarly for I:
- I cannot be in position 4 (from ""latin"") and also not in position 2 (from ""divan""). Therefore, I can be in position 1 or 3? But position 1: if A is there? Conflict? 

Wait, A and I both need positions. Since A must be in position 1? Then what about I? It must be in position 3? Because:
- Positions available: 1,2,3,4,5 (5 is taken by N).
- A: must be 1? Since it can't be 2,3,4? And 5 is taken? So only position 1 for A.
- Then I: cannot be in position 4 (known) and cannot be in position 2 (from ""divan""). So I must be in position 3? Because positions 1 and 2 are excluded for I? Position 1 has A? So I cannot be there? So position 3 is the only option? Then position 2 and 4 are the remaining unknown letters? And we have two unknown letters? Of course, total 5 letters: position 1=A, position 2=?, position 3=I, position 4=?, position 5=N.

Now, the word has form: A ? I ? N

Where ? are the missing letters? But wait, we only have A, I, N, we need two more letters? And we know they are not among the excluded? So letters left? But we haven't tried many.

Also, we know the secret word has exactly these letters? Not exactly? We only know that A, I, N are present? And from tests, we have used only limited letters? But there are two more to be guessed.

Therefore, the word structure is A _ I _ N? And we need to determine the letters at positions 2 and 4? And they must be letters not excluded? Excluded letters: C, E, R, L, T, D, V.

So possible letters: from English alphabet, minus excluded? Common letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.

We need to choose two letters? And form a valid English word.

Also, we must avoid positions? For the unknown positions, we don't have known constraints.

Therefore, we have to guess a word that starts with A, has I in position 3, ends with N, and positions 2 and 4 are unknown? With the specified letters.

But now, we also have to ensure that the word has not any excluded letters? And of course, must be a valid English word.

Let's find such words:

Pattern: A ? I ? N

Possible words:
- ""AGAIN"": But ""again"" has G? Positions: A(1), G(2), A(3), I? But no I? ""again"" is A,G,A,I,N? Wait: positions: A(1), G(2), A? No, ""again"" has two A's? Letter at position 3: A? But we need I at position 3? However, the word ""again"" has A at position 3? Not I? And it has I at position 4? But we need I at position 3? So not? ""again"": A(1),G(2),A(3),I(4),N(5) → I is at position 4? But we require I at position 3? So this does not match? We are guessing that I must be at position 3? Based on our deduction? So for our guess, if we believe that, then positions: 1=A, 2=?, 3=I, 4=?, 5=N? Then ""again"" which is A,G,A,I,N would not fit? Because it has I at 4? Not at 3.

Similarly, ""ADMIN"" has D excluded? And M at position 2? And I at position 4? Not at 3? But D excluded? Anyway, doesn't have I at position 3.

""ALIGN"" has L excluded? And L at position 2? And I? Position? ""align"": A(1),L(2),I(3),G(4),N(5)? But L excluded? Cannot use? But if not excluded, it matches? But L is excluded, so invalid? And we know L is absent? So cannot be used.

So find a word: A ? I ? N, with position 3: I? So words like ""AXIOM"" has O? But ends with M? Not N? ""axiom"" is A,X,I,O,M → ends with M? Not N.

""BEGIN"": B,E,G,I,N → E excluded? E is not allowed.

""BITING"": 6 letters? Too long? We need 5-letter.

""CAVIN"": C excluded? Cannot.

Valid words? For example: ""ASPIN""? Not a word? Or ""AVIAN"": A(1),V(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? But V excluded? We tried V? From ""divan"", V is absent? So excluded? Cannot use V.

""HEMIN"": H,E,M,I,N → E excluded.

""KABIN""? Not a word? ""cabin"" has C excluded.

Perhaps ""MAIN"" has only 4.

A common word: ""OPINE"" ends with E? Not N.

Another: ""QUINS"" plural? But ends with S? Not N.

Word like ""AXION"": we considered earlier? A,X,I,O,N → positions: A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). This matches: A at 1, I at 3, N at 5? And X and O? Both not excluded? And is a valid word? (physics term).

So ""axion"" could be a candidate? But let's see if other common words?

Another: ""PAG IN"" not? ""pagan"" is P,A,G,A,N → no I? And fails our structure.

""RAJ IN"" not.

""ROBIN"" has R excluded.

""STAIN"" has T excluded? And S? But ""stain"": S(1),T(2),A? No I at position 3? If we put as S,T,A,I,N → then I at position 4? Not matching? We need I at position 3? So ""stain"" has positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)? But A at position 3? Also, A should not be at position 3? From ""crane"" we know A cannot be at position 3? So invalid? And T excluded.

So ""axion"" seems possible? Or ""anion""? ""anion"": A(1),N(2),I(3),O(4),N(5)? But N at position 2? And we have I at position 3? But N is already at position 5? And we don't know about position 2? But ""anion"" is A,N,I,O,N → so has two N's? Position 2: N? But we don't know? And position 5: N? Which we know.

But the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know? So possible.

But ""anion"": 
- A at position 1: allowed? Yes.
- I at position 3: as required? Yes.
- N at position 5: correct? But also N at position 2? Is that possible? We need to check if N can be at position 2.

Well, our deduction is that A must be at position 1 and I at position 3? Let's confirm.

From feedback:
- From ""crane"": A was in position 3 (wrong)? So A not at 3.
- From ""latin"": A was in position 2 (wrong)? So A not at 2.
- From ""divan"": A was in position 4 (wrong)? So A not at 4?
- Since position 5 is N? So A can only be at position 1.

Similarly for I:
- From ""latin"": I was in position 4? Wrong position? So secret word has I but not at position 4.
- From ""divan"": I was in position 2? Wrong position? So secret word has I not at position 2.
- Therefore, I can be at position 1 or 3? But position 1 must be A? So I must be at position 3? Yes.

Therefore, structure: position 1: A, position 3: I, position 5: N? With positions 2 and 4 unknown? And both must not be in the excluded list.

So we have A _ I _ N.

Possible words:
- ""again"": as above, has A(1), G(2), A(3) but we need I at position 3? Not A? ""again"" has A,G,A,I,N? A at position 1, G at 2, A at 3, I at 4, N at 5? But position 3 is A? But we need I at position 3? So doesn't match.

Similarly, ""avion"": not English? Meaning aircraft?

- ""anion"": A(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5) → so anion? Yes, valid? ""anion"" is a word? Meaning negatively charged ion.

Check excluded letters: N? But N is not excluded? We know N is in the word? And at position 5, but here it has N at positions 2 and 5? Duplicate N possible? From previous feedback, we haven't ruled out duplicate letters? So it could be.

Similarly, ""axion"": A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5) → contains X and O? Not excluded.

Other words:
- ""abrin"": A(1),B(2),R? R excluded? Cannot.
- ""actin"": A(1),C? C excluded? Cannot.
- ""admin"": D excluded? Cannot.
- ""aizin""? Not a word.
- ""algid"": ends with D? not N? Or ""algid n"" not.

Common word: ""anion"" or ""axion""? Or perhaps ""tapir"" not ending with N.

Another: ""barin"" not a word.

""Cumin"": but C excluded? And U? Not N? ""cumin"" ends with N? C,U,M,I,N? So C(1),U(2),M(3),I(4),N(5)? But I in position 4? But we need at 3? And C excluded? So invalid.

So valid words: ""anion"" and ""axion""?

But ""anion"" has N at position 2? But we already know N is in the word? And at position 5? But having an extra N? Possible? Yes.

Similarly, ""axion"" might be less common.

But another common word: ""amino""? A,M,I,N,O → positions: A(1), M(2), I(3), N? Position 4 must be N? Then O at 5? But we require N at position 5? So A,M,I,N,O → N at position 4? But position 3 is I? Position 4: N? Then O at 5? But N is at position 4 and 5? ""amino"" is A(1),M(2),I(3),N(4),O(5)? So ends with O? Not N? So not matching? Because we need position 5: N? So this word is A,M,I,N,O → so position 4 is N? Position 5 is O? Not N at end.

But we know the secret word ends with N? So ""amino"" does not end with N? So invalid? Unless we have a word like ""amin n"" not.

But we need the word to end with N? So ""amino"" doesn't work? Similarly, ""amine"" ends with E.

So back to ""anion""?
- ""anion"": A(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5)? Position 5: N? Position 3: I? So it fits? And O not excluded.

Similarly, ""axion"": A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5)? X and O not excluded.

Are there others? Like ""apian""? A,P,I,A,N → positions: A(1),P(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? Also fits? ""apian"" means relating to bees? Valid? But A is also at position 4? But that's allowed? As long as no contradiction.

In our guess, the letter at position 4? We don't have constraint? So A? But the word has two A's? Possible? But we know A is present? Could be duplicate? From feedback? First guess ""crane"" had one A? But we don't know? So possible.

Similarly? Among ""anion"", ""axion"", ""apian""?

But ""apian"" has two A's? But we haven't tested? 

Similarly, ""avian"": A,V,I,A,N → but V excluded? From ""divan"", V is absent? So excluded? So cannot use? Position 2: V? Excluded? So invalid.

Therefore? Candidates: ""anion"", ""axion"", and ""apian""?

But first, we must ensure? Also possible? ""stain"" not? As before.

""Ordin"" not a word? But ""organ"" not end N.

So? We need to choose one.

To maximize information? We have used O in the pattern? But both contain O? ""anion"" and ""axion"" have O? ""apian"" has no O.

But to test? We have not used S? But we don't have a word with S? Since A?I?N? With S? For example, ""ASIAN""? I in position 4? Not allowed? And S? But we need I at position 3? ""Asian"": A,S,I,A,N → positions: A(1),S(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? So this could work? But it has I at position 3? And A at position 1 and 4? So possible? But ""asian"" is valid? But we have duplicate A? But allowed? And S not excluded? So ""asian"" also matches? But wait: in ""asian"", position 4 is A? But from ""divan"", we know that A in position 4 is wrong? For the secret word? Because in ""divan"", A was in position 4 and marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position? So the secret word does not have A in position 4? Therefore, ""asian"" with A in position 4? Cannot be guessed? Because we know A cannot be in position 4? Similarly, we deduced A must be at position 1? So?

For ""asian"": position 4: A? But we concluded A is at position 1? And cannot be at position 4? So ""asian"" would have A at position 1 and 4, but position 4 is disallowed? So it would be invalid.

Therefore, A is at position 1? So we don't want a duplicate at 4? Unless the secret word has two A's? But the position 4 for A? We already tested and got wrong? So no? Secret word has A not in position 4? So if we have a word with A at position 1 and something else at position 4? Like ""a s i o n"" but ""asion"" not word? Or ""anion"" or ""axion"".

Thus? ""asian"" is invalid because of possible duplicate and A in position 4? But if we don't have duplicate? But ""asian"" has A at position 1 and position 4? So position 4 A is disallowed? So secret word cannot have A in position 4? So ""asian"" would be incorrect? So we discard? 

Thus only ""anion"" and ""axion""? Or ""apian""?

""apian"": A,P,I,A,N → positions: A(1),P(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? Position 4: A? But we know from ""divan"" that position 4 cannot have A? Because ""divan"" had A at 4? and it was marked wrong? So the secret word does not have A in position 4? Thus ""apian"" has A at position 4? Cannot be? So we must not guess it.

Therefore, only ""anion"" and ""axion"" do not have A in position 4? They have O and X? And N and O respectively? 

In ""anion"": position 4 is O? Position 2 is N? But we are testing a word that has N at position 2? But we haven't ruled out duplicate N? Possible.

Similarly, ""axion"": position 2 is X, position 4 is O.

So we have two choices? Now, which one to guess? Perhaps ""anion"" is more common? Or we can choose? 

We can also consider ""aspin"" not a word? ""krait"" not ending N.

But let's choose ""anion"" as it uses more common letters? X is less common? 

But actually? In Wordle, both are valid? But perhaps ""anion"" is less obscure? Or ""axion""? 

We might also need to consider that the letter at position 2 and 4 might not be excluded? And we haven't tested O? Or X? 

So to test? We can choose? Since position 2 in ""anion"" is N? But N is already known? So we wouldn't gain information? Whereas in ""axion"", position 2 is new letter X? Position 4 is O? Which is new? 

But we can also consider? We have only tried limited letters? Exclude C,E,R,L,T,D,V? So many left? 

But to maximize information? Perhaps we should guess a word that uses letters not tried? And common? 

Thus? ""anion"" has O? But N is repeated? And we know N? So we wouldn't learn? But it could confirm if duplicate exists? 

But ""axion"" tests X and O? Both new? 

But there is no other common word? How about ""amine"" but E excluded.

I think we should go with ""anion""? Because it is a valid word? And if incorrect? We get information.

Or ""fagin""? But ""fagin"" ends with N? F,A,G,I,N → positions: F(1),A(2),G(3),I(4),N(5)? But A in position 2? Disallowed? And I in position 4? Also disallowed? So invalid.

Similarly? ""BEGIN"" has E? Excluded.

Therefore, we decide between ""anion"" and ""axion"".

Since our deduction requires the pattern A _ I _ N? So let's guess ""anion"".

We can feedback? I think ""anion"" is more common than ""axion"".

But both are valid, so we'll go with ""anion"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process

1. **Reviewing Feedback from Previous Guesses:**
   - **Guess 1 (crane):**  
     Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)  
     → Eliminates **C, R, E** from the word.  
     → Confirms **A** and **N** are present but not in positions 3 or 4 (A was guessed in position 3, N in position 4).  
   - **Guess 2 (latin):**  
     Feedback: L(x) A(-) T(x) I(-) N(✓)  
     → Eliminates **L, T** (added to exclusions: C, E, R, L, T).  
     → Confirms **N** is in position 5 (fixed).  
     → Confirms **A** is not in position 2 (marked wrong position).  
     → Confirms **I** is present but not in position 4 (marked wrong position).  
   - **Guess 3 (divan):**  
     Feedback: D(x) I(-) V(x) A(-) N(✓)  
     → Eliminates **D, V** (added to exclusions: C, E, R, L, T, D, V).  
     → Confirms **N** in position 5 remains fixed.  
     → **I** is not in position 2 (marked wrong position).  
     → **A** is not in position 4 (marked wrong position).  

2. **Consolidating Position Constraints:**
   - **A**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from guesses 1 and 2), and not in position 4 (from guess 3). Position 5 is N, so **A must be in position 1**.
   - **I**: Cannot be in position 4 (from guess 2) and not in position 2 (from guess 3). With position 1 taken by A and position 5 by N, **I must be in position 3**.
   - **N**: Fixed in position 5.
   - Excluded letters: **C, E, R, L, T, D, V**.
   - Secret word structure: **A (1) ? I (3) ? N (5)**. Positions 2 and 4 need new letters not excluded.

3. **Identifying Remaining Letters:**
   - The word must be a valid English 5-letter word.
   - Available letters (not excluded or tested): **B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z**.
   - Possible words fitting **A ? I ? N**:
     - **anion** (A, N, I, O, N) → Valid (meaning: negatively charged ion), with N at position 2 (duplicate possible) and O at position 4.
     - **axion** (A, X, I, O, N) → Valid (physics term), with X at position 2 and O at position 4.
     - **apian** (A, P, I, A, N) → Invalid—uses A at position 4, but A cannot be in position 4 (from guess 3 feedback).
     - **avian** (A, V, I, A, N) → Invalid—V is excluded.
     - **asian** (A, S, I, A, N) → Invalid—uses A at position 4, barred by feedback.
     - Other tested words like ""admin"" or ""stain"" include excluded letters or mismatched I position.
   - **Final candidates**: **anion** or **axion**.

4. **Selecting the Guess:**
   - Both **anion** and **axion** satisfy all position constraints and avoid excluded letters.
   - **anion** is prioritized as it contains more common letters (O) and includes a duplicate N, which could yield informative feedback if correct or incorrect.
   - Guessing **anion** tests the deduced pattern and leverages feedback efficiently.

But we don\'t know. We need to test.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a word that has A and N in positions that we haven\'t tried and also include other letters we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe have not tested the letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe want to maximize information, so we should try to cover as many new common letters as possible.\n\nCommon letters in English: S, T, L, O, I, etc.\n\nLet\'s try to form a word that includes A and N and three new common letters.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""saint"": S, A, I, N, T -> but A is in position 2 and N in position 4? Wait, let\'s break it:\n  S (1), A (2), I (3), N (4), T (5)\n  However, in the feedback, we know that A cannot be in position 3? Actually, in the first guess, A was in position 3 and that was wrong. But in this word, A is in position 2, which is allowed. Similarly, N was in position 4 in the first guess and that was wrong, but in this word, N is in position 4 again? That would be the same position as before, which we know is wrong. So we cannot put N in position 4.\n\nTherefore, we must avoid putting N in position 4. So ""saint"" is invalid because N is in position 4.\n\nWe need a word where N is not in position 4 and A is not in position 3.\n\nAnother word: ""stand"" -> S, T, A, N, D\nPositions: S(1), T(2), A(3), N(4), D(5)\nBut A is in position 3? We know from feedback that A cannot be in position 3. So that\'s invalid.\n\nAnother word: ""tansy"" (a plant) -> T, A, N, S, Y\nPositions: T(1), A(2), N(3), S(4), Y(5)\nThis avoids position 3 for A (A is in 2) and position 4 for N (N is in 3). So that\'s acceptable.\n\nBut we are not sure if ""tansy"" is common. We can try more common words.\n\nAnother word: ""plain"" -> P, L, A, I, N\nPositions: P(1), L(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)\nBut A is in position 3? That\'s the same as the first guess and we know it\'s wrong. So invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid position 3 for A.\n\nHow about ""panel""? But E is excluded, so we cannot use E.\n\nWe cannot use E.\n\nAnother word: ""manic"" -> M, A, N, I, C -> but C is excluded. So no.\n\nWe must avoid C, R, E.\n\nAnother word: ""sandy"" -> S, A, N, D, Y\nPositions: S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5)\nThis is good because A is in 2 (not 3) and N is in 3 (not 4). Also, we are testing S, A, N, D, Y.\n\nBut we have to make sure it\'s a valid word. ""sandy"" is a valid word.\n\nAlternatively, ""handy"": H, A, N, D, Y -> A in position 2, N in position 3. Also valid.\n\nWe can also consider ""latin"" but L, A, T, I, N -> A in position 2, N in position 5. That\'s acceptable because N is not in 4. But we have to check the positions: \nPosition 1: L (new)\nPosition 2: A (allowed)\nPosition 3: T (new)\nPosition 4: I (new)\nPosition 5: N (allowed, since previously N was in 4 and that was wrong, but 5 is new)\n\nSo ""latin"" is acceptable.\n\nBut we are testing more letters with ""latin"": L, T, I, and we already know A and N.\n\nWe can also consider ""piano"", but that has O and is 5 letters? P-I-A-N-O -> but that has O, and we haven\'t tested O. However, we are limited by the known letters.\n\nBut note: we are trying to find the secret word, and we know it has A and N. We also want to test as many new letters as possible.\n\nAnother common word: ""stain"" -> S, T, A, I, N -> but A is in position 3? That\'s not allowed. So no.\n\n""train"" has R and we know R is excluded.\n\n""plain"" has A in position 3 and we cannot use that.\n\nHow about ""adorn""? But that\'s 5 letters? A, D, O, R, N -> but R is excluded, so no.\n\nWe must avoid R.\n\nAnother word: ""daunt"" -> D, A, U, N, T -> positions: D(1), A(2), U(3), N(4), T(5)\nBut N is in position 4? We know that N cannot be in position 4 because in the first guess it was in 4 and was wrong. So we cannot use N in position 4. Therefore, ""daunt"" is invalid.\n\nWe need to avoid putting N in position 4.\n\nLet me try to list words that have A and N, and avoid positions 3 for A and 4 for N, and avoid C, R, E.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""sandy"": S(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> N is in 3, which is new. A is in 2, which is new.\n- ""handy"": H(1), A(2), N(3), D(4), Y(5) -> same as above but with H.\n- ""latin"": L(1), A(2), T(3), I(4), N(5) -> A in 2, N in 5 (new positions).\n- ""mania"": M(1), A(2), N(3), I(4), A(5) -> but we have two A\'s? The secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know. Also, we are testing M, A, N, I. But A is in 2 and 5? We know A is at least once in the word, but maybe twice? We don\'t have information. However, we are allowed to guess duplicate letters. But in this case, we are testing only 4 distinct letters: M, A, N, I. And we are using A twice.\n\nBut we don\'t know if the word has two A\'s. It might be inefficient.\n\nAnother word: ""paint"" -> P, A, I, N, T -> positions: P(1), A(2), I(3), N(4), T(5) -> but N is in position 4? That\'s not allowed. So invalid.\n\n""taint"": T, A, I, N, T -> A in position 2, N in position 4 -> invalid because of N in 4.\n\n""nasty"": N, A, S, T, Y -> positions: N(1), A(2), S(3), T(4), Y(5). This is acceptable because A is in 2 (not 3) and N is in 1 (not 4). So we can use ""nasty"".\n\nBut note: we are putting N in position 1, which we haven\'t tried before. And A in 2.\n\nWe can also consider ""salsa"" but that has two S\'s and no N? We need to include N.\n\nWe must include both A and N.\n\nAfter considering, I think ""latin"" is a good choice because it tests L, T, I and places A and N in new positions.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we got: we have A and N in the word, so we are trying to find their correct positions and also discover other letters.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that doesn\'t put A and N in the same positions as before and uses common letters.\n\nI\'ll go with ""latin"": \n  L (new), A (in word but not in position 3, so we put in 2), T (new), I (new), N (in word but not in position 4, so we put in 5).\n\nThis way, we test three new letters and the positions for A and N.\n\nSo my next guess is ""latin"".\n\nBut note: we are not forced to use both known letters. However, we know the word has A and N, so if we don\'t include them, we might waste a guess. It\'s better to include them to get more information about their positions.\n\nTherefore, I choose ""latin"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, R, and E are **not** in the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- A and N **are** in the word but in the wrong positions (marked ""-""). Specifically:\n  - A cannot be in position 3 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").\n  - N cannot be in position 4 (since it was wrong there in ""crane"").\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A** and **N** (since they are in the secret word), but avoid placing A in position 3 or N in position 4.\n- Must **avoid** using C, R, or E.\n- Should prioritize common letters not yet tested (e.g., S, T, L, I, D, O) to maximize information.\n\nAfter evaluating options, ""latin"" is a strong choice:\n- **L** (new), **A** (in position 2, avoiding position 3), **T** (new), **I** (new), **N** (in position 5, avoiding position 4).\n- Tests three new common letters (L, T, I) while respecting the known constraints for A and N.\n\n<guess>latin</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: latin -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(x) I(-) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1.

Since we have three confirmed letters (A, I, N) and the word is five letters, there are two more letters we haven\'t identified yet.\n\nWe have tested the following letters: C, R, A, N, E (first guess) and L, A, T, I, N (second guess).

A is not in position 2 or 3 (and also not in position 5 because that\'s N). So A can only be in position 1 or 4? The positions in the word: 1,2,3,4,5. Position 5 is taken by N. So A can be in position 1 or 4? But note: from ""latin"", A was in position 2 (and was wrong) and from ""crane"" in position 3 (wrong). So A cannot be in 2 or 3. Position 5 is N, so indeed A can only be in position 1 or 4.\n\nSimilarly, I is not in position 4?

Or if A is in position 4, then I can be in 1,2,3.\n\nWe also have two other letters to include.\n\nWe need to avoid the excluded letters: C, E, R, L, T.\n\nWe should use common letters not tried: for example, S, O, D, M, P, U, B, etc.\n\nLet me try to think of words ending in N and containing A and I.\n\nFirst, if A is in position 1: then we have A _ _ _ N. And the word must contain I and two other letters.\n\nPossible words: \n- ""ADMIN"" but D, M are new? But ""admin"" is a common word. However, we have to check: \n  - A at 1? Allowed.\n  - I: must be in the word, and in ""admin"", I is at position 4? But wait, position 4: I? But we cannot put I in position 4 because feedback says it\'s not in that position? Wait, in ""latin"", I was in position 4 and it was marked \'-\', meaning I is in the word but not in position 4. So if we put I in position 4 in a new word, it would be incorrect? Actually, no: the secret word cannot have I in position 4. So in ""admin"", if we try it, and I is in position 4, that would contradict because we know I cannot be at position 4.\n\nTherefore, ""admin"" is invalid because it has I at position 4, which is disallowed.\n\nSimilarly, other words: e.g., ""AKING"" is not a word.\n\n""AVAIL"" but ends with L and L is excluded? Also L is excluded, so we cannot use L.\n\nHow about ""ASIAN""? Let\'s check:\n  A in position 1? Allowed.\n  I: must be in the word. In ""asian"", I is in position 4? Again position 4, which is disallowed. So invalid.\n\nPosition for I must be 1,2,3 only. Since position 5 is N and position 4 cannot hold I.\n\nTherefore, if A is in 1 and I in 2 or 3.\n\nFor example, ""ALIEN"" but E is excluded and L excluded? And it has E? E is not allowed.\n\nWe must avoid E.\n\nAnother possibility: ""AMINO"" but O? ""amino"" is a word. But:\n  A at position 1? Allowed.\n  I: at position 3? That\'s allowed because position 3 is okay for I? (Yes, since we only know it can\'t be in position 4).\n  But the word ends with O, not N? ""amino"" ends with O? We need to end with N. So not.\n\nNow, other pattern: A in position 4? Then the word is _ _ _ A N.\n\nAnd I must be in one of positions 1,2,3.\n\nSo the word would be _ _ _ A N.\n\nAnd I can be at 1,2, or 3.\n\nAlso, we have two other letters.\n\nCommon words: e.g., ""URBAN"" but U and B? But avoids exclusions? \n  U(1), R? R is excluded. So cannot use R.\n\n""Human""? H, U, M, A, N -> but M is allowed? However, U? But E is excluded, R is excluded, but R not here. However, ""human"" has H, U, M, A, N. R is not used, but wait: in first guess R is excluded so we cannot use R? Actually, in ""urban"" we saw R excluded. So ""urban"" not allowed. For ""human"": no excluded letters? We excluded C, R, E, L, T. So H, U, M are new and okay.\n\nBut in ""human"", I is not present? The word must contain I? We know I must be in the word. ""human"" has H,U,M,A,N — no I. So we cannot guess that because I is missing.\n\nWe must include I.\n\nSo words ending with AN and containing I.\n\nFor example, ""urban"" has R excluded.\n\n""ROBIN"" has R excluded.\n\n""VIXEN"" has E and X? E excluded.\n\n""CHAIR"" has R and C? Excluded.\n\nA better idea: let\'s list common words ending with N and containing A and I, and avoid excluded letters.\n\nExcluded: C, E, R, L, T\n\nWe can use: S, O, D, M, P, U, B, G, H, K, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""SABIN"" (like vaccine) - S,A,B,I,N → forms: S(1), A(2), B(3), I(4), N(5). But note: I is in position 4? We know I cannot be in position 4, because from ""latin"" feedback, I was in position 4 and marked \'-\' meaning it is in the word but not at position 4. So we cannot put I in position 4. Thus, ""sabin"" would be invalid because it puts I in position 4.\n\n- ""PAIN"" — that\'s 4 letters, we need 5.\n\nAnother: ""MAINS"" — but that ends with S? We need ending with N.\n\nPerhaps ""KIWAN"" — not a valid word.\n\nHow about ""DEVIN""? But E excluded? E is excluded.\n\n""BLIND"" — ends with D? Not N.\n\nPerhaps ""BRAIN"" — has R, excluded.\n\n""DAISY"" — ends with Y? Not N.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAnother pattern: A in position 4. So the word is ... A N at end. And I must be in position 1,2, or 3.\n\nFor example: a word like X X I A N -> positions: 1,2,3,4,5: N already set. So [1][2][3] A N.\n\nAnd I at 1,2, or 3.\n\nFor instance, ""VIXEN"" -> V, I, X, E, N -> but E excluded and ends with N? X and E is excluded? E is excluded, so invalid.\n\n""ANIM U"" — not 5 letters.\n\nPerhaps ""OXBOW"" — no I and no A? And not ending with N.\n\nLet\'s think: ""BASIN"" -> B, A, S, I, N -> but I is at position 4? Not allowed. \nSimilarly, ""ROSIN"" has R excluded.\n\nHow about ""MAIDEN""? Too long.\n\n5-letter? ""OCTAN"" not a common word.\n\nAnother: ""ADMIN"" we already saw has I in position 4? ADMIN: A, D, M, I, N → I is at position 4? Disallowed.\n\nBut we need I not in position 4.\n\nSo maybe I in position 2 or 3.\n\nFor example, with A at 4: \n- Position 1: put I? Then I(1), then position 2,3 are new letters, A(4), N(5). So I _ _ A N.\n\nBut can we have I at position 1? We don\'t know until we try.\n\nFor instance: ""IRAQ N"" not valid.\n\n""ISL AN"" but L excluded and not a word.\n\n""IMAGN"" not a word.\n\nMaybe without I at 1? With I at position 2: for example, X I X A N.\n\nAnd no excluded letters.\n\nSo for position 1, we can put S: ""S I T A N"" but T is excluded? T is marked x in second guess. So we cannot use T.\n\nSimilarly, D: ""D I V A N"" → DIVAN is a word? D(1), I(2), V(3), A(4), N(5). This might work. Avoiding excluded letters: D, V not excluded? Only C,E,R,L,T excluded.\n\nSo DIVAN: \n- D not tested, \n- I: in position 2? We have no information that I cannot be at position 2? We only know it cannot be at position 4. So position 2 is allowed.\n- V new, \n- A in position 4: and we said A can be in position 4? Yes.\n- N at 5.\n\nSo DIVAN could be a guess.\n\nSimilarly, ""P I C A N"" but C excluded? Or ""WICAN"" not a word.\n\nAnother word: ""W I D A N"" not a word.\n\n""DIVAN"" seems valid.\n\nBut is ""divan"" common? It means a sofa.\n\nWe could try ""S I M A N"" but not a word? We have ""simian"" but that\'s 6 letters? Simian is 6? S-I-M-I-A-N, 6 letters.\n\nNo, 5-letter: SIMAN is not a valid word.\n\nOther possibilities: ""B I D A N"" not a word.\n\n""IVYAN"" not a word.\n\nSo ""divan"" is a possibility.\n\nAnother structure: A not in position 4, but in position 1? Earlier we considered.\n\nPosition 1: A, and then I at position 3? So A _ I _ N.\n\nWith position 2 and 4 are new.\n\nWords: ""ALIGN"" but L excluded and G? L excluded.\n\n""AXION"": A, X, I, O, N → positions: A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). This seems good. \n- A at position 1: allowed.\n- I at position 3: we have no restriction against position 3 for I? Only position 4 is forbidden. \n- Avoids excluded letters? X, O not excluded? Only C,E,R,L,T excluded.\n\n""Axion"" is a word (physics term).\n\nSo ""axion"" could be another guess.\n\nWe also have ""avion"" but that\'s French, usually ""avion"" is not English word? We need English word. ""Axion"" is English.\n\nSimilarly, ""PRION"" has R excluded.\n\n""DENIM"" ends with M? Not N.\n\nSo possibilities: ""divan"" or ""axion"".\n\nBut ""axion"" tests more common letters? X is less common.\n\nWe can also consider ""admin"" but invalid because of I in position 4.\n\nAnother common word: ""RAIN"" has only 4.\n\nWe already have ""divan"" and ""axion"".\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a better word? We want to test common letters.\n\nLetters not tested: S has not been tested? We haven\'t used S.\n\nIn first guess: crane had no S.\nSecond guess: latin had no S.\n\nSimilarly, O, D, M, P, U, B, G, H, Y, etc.\n\nSo perhaps we should include S to test.\n\nWhy not a word with S and O or something.\n\nFor example, with A in position 1 and I in position 3? We have A _ I _ N.\n\nSo positions: [1]=A, [3]=I, [5]=N, then [2] and [4] to fill.\n\nWe need to choose two letters. Avoid excluded C,E,R,L,T.\n\nPossible: [2]=S, [4]=O? Then ""ASION""? But ""asion"" is not a word.\n\n[2]=O, [4]=S: ""A O I S N"" → ""aoisn"" not a word.\n\n[2]=M, [4]=S: ""AMIS N"" → ""amiss"" ends with SS? Not N.\n\nN is at 5.\n\nAnother: [2]=D, [4]=O: ""ADION"" not a word.\n\n""ADMIN"" becomes invalid.\n\nPerhaps with A in position 4.\n\nAs before: _ _ _ A N, with I in one of the first three.\n\nAnd including S.\n\nFor example: position 1=S, position 2=I, position 3=O, then ""S I O A N"" → ""sion a n""? Not a word.\n\nPosition 1=O, position 2=I, position 3=S: ""O I S A N"" → ""o is a n"" not a word.\n\nPerhaps ""DAISY"" does not end with N.\n\nBut we have ""doing"" not end with N.\n\nAnother word: ""SPAIN"" has P, but I at position 4? ""spain"": S(1), P(2), A(3), I(4), N(5). \nBut:\n- A is at position 3? From first guess with ""crane"", A in position 3 was wrong. We cannot put A in position 3. So ""spain"" would have A in position 3, invalid.\n\nSimilarly, ""train"" has R.\n\n""MAINS"" is M,A,I,N,S → ends with S? S is at position 5 but we need position 5=N.\n\nSo not.\n\nConsidering ""divan"" and ""axion"", both are valid and satisfy the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, ""damn"" is 4 letters.\n\n""Pagan"" ends with N? G,A,N → but pag a n? P A G A N -> that has two A\'s? And it ends with N? But we don\'t know if duplicate letters are allowed? We don\'t have information against that.\n\n""pagan"": P(1), A(2), G(3), A(4), N(5). But note: A is in position 2, which from ""latin"" we know A cannot be in position 2 (because in ""latin"" A was in position 2 and marked \'-\', meaning it is in the word but wrong position). So we cannot put A in position 2? Exactly.\n\nIn ""pagan"", A is in position 2: that is disallowed because we already tried A in position 2 and it was not correct.\n\nSimilarly, A is in position 4? Which is okay? But the word has two A\'s? Possibly? But position 4 for A is allowed because we haven\'t tried it? The only positions A cannot be are 2 and 3.\n\nSo ""Pagan"": \n- Position 1: P\n- Position 2: A (not allowed because we know from guess 2 that position 2 has A and it was wrong)\n- Position 3: G\n- Position 4: A (allowed, because we haven\'t tried position 4 yet)\n- Position 5: N\n\nBut in the word ""pagan"", position 2 also has A? However, the feedback would show for position 2: A in position 2 is disallowed? Specifically, we know from ""latin"" that when we put A in position 2, it was incorrect. Therefore, we cannot use that in a new word? Unless we are testing for duplicate: the word might have two A\'s? But position 2 cannot have A because we already know it\'s wrong.\n\nSo when we say \'disallowed\', it means that in the secret word, position 2 is not A? Because it was tried and marked as wrong position. So the secret word does not have A in position 2.\n\nTherefore, ""pagan"" would be invalid for guess because it puts A in position 2.\n\nSo we discard.\n\nBack to ""divan"" or ""axion"".\n\nSince we haven\'t tested S, perhaps we can look for a word that includes S and avoids positions.\n\nFor example, if A is in position 4, then we have _ _ _ A N.\n\nAnd I in position 1,2, or 3.\n\nWith S? For example, ""USN IA N"" not a word.\n\n"" MAS A N"" with I? e.g., ""MAJOR"" not ending with N.\n\nAnother common ending: ""woman"" W O M A N? Ends with N? That\'s a valid word: W(1), O(2), M(3), A(4), N(5). \n- And we have A at position 4: allowed.\n- Does it have I? No, ""woman"" has no I? But we must include I? The secret word has I? From feedback: in ""latin"", I was marked in the word (since \'-\')? Yes, I is in the secret word. But ""woman"" has W,O,M,A,N — no I. So we cannot choose it.\n\nSimilarly, ""human"" no I.\n\nSo we must have a word with I.\n\nNow, let\'s try to find words like ""vista n"" not.\n\nPerhaps ""divan"" is the best choice? Or ""axion"".\n\nBut to maximize information, we can choose a word that has more common letters? ""divan"" has D, I, V, A, N; we know A and N, but D and V are new. And I is tested for position 2.\n\nSimilarly, ""axion"" has A, X, I, O, N; X is less common? But O is common.\n\nAnother idea: ""SHIN"" is 4 letters.\n\n""Begin"" has G? ""begin"" B,E,G,I,N → but E excluded? E is excluded.\n\n""piano"" not ending in N.\n\nI think our best bets are ""divan"" or ""axion"". We can also consider ""diana"" but ends with A? Not with N.\n\nLet\'s choose ""divan"": D, I, V, A, N → positions: 1:D, 2:I, 3:V, 4:A, 5:N.\n\nThis satisfies:\n- N at 5.\n- A at position 4: which is allowed (A can be at 1 or 4).\n- I at position 2: we have no restriction against position 2? Only that I cannot be at position 4? So position 2 is okay.\n- Avoids excluded letters: no C,E,R,L,T.\n\nSo guess ""divan"".\n\nAlternatively, to test more vowels? ""axion"" might be less common.\n\nAnother word: ""rabid"" not ending with N.\n\nPerhaps ""koine"" but E excluded.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""divan"".After reviewing the feedback:\n- **Guess 1: crane**  \n  Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  \n  → This eliminates C, R, E as possible letters.  \n  → Confirms A and N are in the secret word, but not in positions 3 or 4 (since A was guessed in position 3 and N in position 4, both marked wrong).\n  \n- **Guess 2: latin**  \n  Feedback: L(x), A(-), T(x), I(-), N(✓)  \n  → This eliminates L and T as possible letters.  \n  → Confirms A is not in position 2 (as it was marked wrong here), and I is not in position 4 (marked wrong) but is present in the word.  \n  → Confirms N is in position 5 (✓ in position 5).\n\n**Consolidated Insights**:\n- Secret word contains: **A**, **I**, and **N** (with **N** fixed at position 5).\n- The word ends with **N** (position 5).\n- **A** cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (from previous feedback).\n- **I** cannot be in position 4 (from previous feedback).\n- Excluded letters: **C, E, R, L, T**.\n- Known letter positions:  \nPosition 5: **N** (confirmed).  \nA must be in position 1 or 4 (only available options since positions 2/3 are invalid, and position 5 is taken by N).  \nI must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (only options since position 4/5 are invalid/taken).  \n- Need to identify two additional letters for the unknown positions (since only A, I, and N are confirmed).\n\nFor the next guess, the word **DIVAN** is chosen because it:  \n- Includes **A** (in position 4, allowed) and **I** (in position 2, allowed).  \n- Includes N at position 5 (confirmed).  \n- Uses new common letters (**D** and **V**) not tested before.  \n- Avoids all excluded letters (C, E, R, L, T).  \n- Tests potential positions for A (position 4) and I (position 2).  \n- Is a valid English word meaning a type of sofa or council chamber.  \n\nThis guess will help narrow down the possible letters and positions further.\n\n<guess>divan</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: latin -> FEEDBACK: L(x) A(-) T(x) I(-) N(✓)\nGuess 3: divan -> FEEDBACK: D(x) I(-) V(x) A(-) N(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from three guesses:\n\n1. **crane**: C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(absent)\n   - Thus, the word contains A and N, but not at positions 3 and 4 respectively (since in ""crane"", A was in position 3 and N in position 4).\n   - Excluded letters: C, R, E.\n\n2. **latin**: L(absent), A(present but wrong position), T(absent), I(present but wrong position), N(correct position at 5)\n   - N is fixed at position 5.\n   - A is not at position 2 (since it was guessed there and marked wrong position).\n   - I is not at position 4 (marked wrong position).\n   - Excluded letters: L, T (added to previous exclusions: C, E, R, L, T).\n   - Present letters: A, I, N.\n\n3. **divan**: D(absent), I(present but wrong position), V(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(correct position at 5)\n   - D and V are absent, so add to excluded letters: D, V.\n   - I is in the word but not at position 2 (since it was in position 2 of ""divan"" and marked \'-\').\n   - A is in the word but not at position 4 (since it was in position 4 and marked \'-\').\n\nConsolidating:\n- **Confirmed positions**: Position 5 is N.\n- **Confirmed present letters**: A, I, N (N is at position 5, so we focus on A and I).\n- **Letters that must be in the word**: A, I (since they are present).\n- **Excluded letters**: C, R, E, L, T, D, V.\n\nNow, constraints on positions:\n- A cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from guess 1 and 2), and now also not position 4 (from guess 3). Therefore, A must be in position 1? The positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 5 is N, so A can only be in 1 or 4? But now we know A is not in 4? From ""divan"", A was in position 4 and marked \'-\'? So A is not in position 4. Thus, only position 1 is left for A? So A must be in position 1.\n\nSimilarly for I:\n- I cannot be in position 4 (from ""latin"") and also not in position 2 (from ""divan""). Therefore, I can be in position 1 or 3? But position 1: if A is there? Conflict? \n\nWait, A and I both need positions. Since A must be in position 1? Then what about I? It must be in position 3? Because:\n- Positions available: 1,2,3,4,5 (5 is taken by N).\n- A: must be 1? Since it can\'t be 2,3,4? And 5 is taken? So only position 1 for A.\n- Then I: cannot be in position 4 (known) and cannot be in position 2 (from ""divan""). So I must be in position 3? Because positions 1 and 2 are excluded for I? Position 1 has A? So I cannot be there? So position 3 is the only option? Then position 2 and 4 are the remaining unknown letters? And we have two unknown letters? Of course, total 5 letters: position 1=A, position 2=?, position 3=I, position 4=?, position 5=N.\n\nNow, the word has form: A ? I ? N\n\nWhere ? are the missing letters? But wait, we only have A, I, N, we need two more letters? And we know they are not among the excluded? So letters left? But we haven\'t tried many.\n\nAlso, we know the secret word has exactly these letters? Not exactly? We only know that A, I, N are present? And from tests, we have used only limited letters? But there are two more to be guessed.\n\nTherefore, the word structure is A _ I _ N? And we need to determine the letters at positions 2 and 4? And they must be letters not excluded? Excluded letters: C, E, R, L, T, D, V.\n\nSo possible letters: from English alphabet, minus excluded? Common letters left: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe need to choose two letters? And form a valid English word.\n\nAlso, we must avoid positions? For the unknown positions, we don\'t have known constraints.\n\nTherefore, we have to guess a word that starts with A, has I in position 3, ends with N, and positions 2 and 4 are unknown? With the specified letters.\n\nBut now, we also have to ensure that the word has not any excluded letters? And of course, must be a valid English word.\n\nLet\'s find such words:\n\nPattern: A ? I ? N\n\nPossible words:\n- ""AGAIN"": But ""again"" has G? Positions: A(1), G(2), A(3), I? But no I? ""again"" is A,G,A,I,N? Wait: positions: A(1), G(2), A? No, ""again"" has two A\'s? Letter at position 3: A? But we need I at position 3? However, the word ""again"" has A at position 3? Not I? And it has I at position 4? But we need I at position 3? So not? ""again"": A(1),G(2),A(3),I(4),N(5) → I is at position 4? But we require I at position 3? So this does not match? We are guessing that I must be at position 3? Based on our deduction? So for our guess, if we believe that, then positions: 1=A, 2=?, 3=I, 4=?, 5=N? Then ""again"" which is A,G,A,I,N would not fit? Because it has I at 4? Not at 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""ADMIN"" has D excluded? And M at position 2? And I at position 4? Not at 3? But D excluded? Anyway, doesn\'t have I at position 3.\n\n""ALIGN"" has L excluded? And L at position 2? And I? Position? ""align"": A(1),L(2),I(3),G(4),N(5)? But L excluded? Cannot use? But if not excluded, it matches? But L is excluded, so invalid? And we know L is absent? So cannot be used.\n\nSo find a word: A ? I ? N, with position 3: I? So words like ""AXIOM"" has O? But ends with M? Not N? ""axiom"" is A,X,I,O,M → ends with M? Not N.\n\n""BEGIN"": B,E,G,I,N → E excluded? E is not allowed.\n\n""BITING"": 6 letters? Too long? We need 5-letter.\n\n""CAVIN"": C excluded? Cannot.\n\nValid words? For example: ""ASPIN""? Not a word? Or ""AVIAN"": A(1),V(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? But V excluded? We tried V? From ""divan"", V is absent? So excluded? Cannot use V.\n\n""HEMIN"": H,E,M,I,N → E excluded.\n\n""KABIN""? Not a word? ""cabin"" has C excluded.\n\nPerhaps ""MAIN"" has only 4.\n\nA common word: ""OPINE"" ends with E? Not N.\n\nAnother: ""QUINS"" plural? But ends with S? Not N.\n\nWord like ""AXION"": we considered earlier? A,X,I,O,N → positions: A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5). This matches: A at 1, I at 3, N at 5? And X and O? Both not excluded? And is a valid word? (physics term).\n\nSo ""axion"" could be a candidate? But let\'s see if other common words?\n\nAnother: ""PAG IN"" not? ""pagan"" is P,A,G,A,N → no I? And fails our structure.\n\n""RAJ IN"" not.\n\n""ROBIN"" has R excluded.\n\n""STAIN"" has T excluded? And S? But ""stain"": S(1),T(2),A? No I at position 3? If we put as S,T,A,I,N → then I at position 4? Not matching? We need I at position 3? So ""stain"" has positions: S(1), T(2), A(3), I(4), N(5)? But A at position 3? Also, A should not be at position 3? From ""crane"" we know A cannot be at position 3? So invalid? And T excluded.\n\nSo ""axion"" seems possible? Or ""anion""? ""anion"": A(1),N(2),I(3),O(4),N(5)? But N at position 2? And we have I at position 3? But N is already at position 5? And we don\'t know about position 2? But ""anion"" is A,N,I,O,N → so has two N\'s? Position 2: N? But we don\'t know? And position 5: N? Which we know.\n\nBut the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know? So possible.\n\nBut ""anion"": \n- A at position 1: allowed? Yes.\n- I at position 3: as required? Yes.\n- N at position 5: correct? But also N at position 2? Is that possible? We need to check if N can be at position 2.\n\nWell, our deduction is that A must be at position 1 and I at position 3? Let\'s confirm.\n\nFrom feedback:\n- From ""crane"": A was in position 3 (wrong)? So A not at 3.\n- From ""latin"": A was in position 2 (wrong)? So A not at 2.\n- From ""divan"": A was in position 4 (wrong)? So A not at 4?\n- Since position 5 is N? So A can only be at position 1.\n\nSimilarly for I:\n- From ""latin"": I was in position 4? Wrong position? So secret word has I but not at position 4.\n- From ""divan"": I was in position 2? Wrong position? So secret word has I not at position 2.\n- Therefore, I can be at position 1 or 3? But position 1 must be A? So I must be at position 3? Yes.\n\nTherefore, structure: position 1: A, position 3: I, position 5: N? With positions 2 and 4 unknown? And both must not be in the excluded list.\n\nSo we have A _ I _ N.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""again"": as above, has A(1), G(2), A(3) but we need I at position 3? Not A? ""again"" has A,G,A,I,N? A at position 1, G at 2, A at 3, I at 4, N at 5? But position 3 is A? But we need I at position 3? So doesn\'t match.\n\nSimilarly, ""avion"": not English? Meaning aircraft?\n\n- ""anion"": A(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5) → so anion? Yes, valid? ""anion"" is a word? Meaning negatively charged ion.\n\nCheck excluded letters: N? But N is not excluded? We know N is in the word? And at position 5, but here it has N at positions 2 and 5? Duplicate N possible? From previous feedback, we haven\'t ruled out duplicate letters? So it could be.\n\nSimilarly, ""axion"": A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5) → contains X and O? Not excluded.\n\nOther words:\n- ""abrin"": A(1),B(2),R? R excluded? Cannot.\n- ""actin"": A(1),C? C excluded? Cannot.\n- ""admin"": D excluded? Cannot.\n- ""aizin""? Not a word.\n- ""algid"": ends with D? not N? Or ""algid n"" not.\n\nCommon word: ""anion"" or ""axion""? Or perhaps ""tapir"" not ending with N.\n\nAnother: ""barin"" not a word.\n\n""Cumin"": but C excluded? And U? Not N? ""cumin"" ends with N? C,U,M,I,N? So C(1),U(2),M(3),I(4),N(5)? But I in position 4? But we need at 3? And C excluded? So invalid.\n\nSo valid words: ""anion"" and ""axion""?\n\nBut ""anion"" has N at position 2? But we already know N is in the word? And at position 5? But having an extra N? Possible? Yes.\n\nSimilarly, ""axion"" might be less common.\n\nBut another common word: ""amino""? A,M,I,N,O → positions: A(1), M(2), I(3), N? Position 4 must be N? Then O at 5? But we require N at position 5? So A,M,I,N,O → N at position 4? But position 3 is I? Position 4: N? Then O at 5? But N is at position 4 and 5? ""amino"" is A(1),M(2),I(3),N(4),O(5)? So ends with O? Not N? So not matching? Because we need position 5: N? So this word is A,M,I,N,O → so position 4 is N? Position 5 is O? Not N at end.\n\nBut we know the secret word ends with N? So ""amino"" does not end with N? So invalid? Unless we have a word like ""amin n"" not.\n\nBut we need the word to end with N? So ""amino"" doesn\'t work? Similarly, ""amine"" ends with E.\n\nSo back to ""anion""?\n- ""anion"": A(1), N(2), I(3), O(4), N(5)? Position 5: N? Position 3: I? So it fits? And O not excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""axion"": A(1), X(2), I(3), O(4), N(5)? X and O not excluded.\n\nAre there others? Like ""apian""? A,P,I,A,N → positions: A(1),P(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? Also fits? ""apian"" means relating to bees? Valid? But A is also at position 4? But that\'s allowed? As long as no contradiction.\n\nIn our guess, the letter at position 4? We don\'t have constraint? So A? But the word has two A\'s? Possible? But we know A is present? Could be duplicate? From feedback? First guess ""crane"" had one A? But we don\'t know? So possible.\n\nSimilarly? Among ""anion"", ""axion"", ""apian""?\n\nBut ""apian"" has two A\'s? But we haven\'t tested? \n\nSimilarly, ""avian"": A,V,I,A,N → but V excluded? From ""divan"", V is absent? So excluded? So cannot use? Position 2: V? Excluded? So invalid.\n\nTherefore? Candidates: ""anion"", ""axion"", and ""apian""?\n\nBut first, we must ensure? Also possible? ""stain"" not? As before.\n\n""Ordin"" not a word? But ""organ"" not end N.\n\nSo? We need to choose one.\n\nTo maximize information? We have used O in the pattern? But both contain O? ""anion"" and ""axion"" have O? ""apian"" has no O.\n\nBut to test? We have not used S? But we don\'t have a word with S? Since A?I?N? With S? For example, ""ASIAN""? I in position 4? Not allowed? And S? But we need I at position 3? ""Asian"": A,S,I,A,N → positions: A(1),S(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? So this could work? But it has I at position 3? And A at position 1 and 4? So possible? But ""asian"" is valid? But we have duplicate A? But allowed? And S not excluded? So ""asian"" also matches? But wait: in ""asian"", position 4 is A? But from ""divan"", we know that A in position 4 is wrong? For the secret word? Because in ""divan"", A was in position 4 and marked as \'-\' meaning present but wrong position? So the secret word does not have A in position 4? Therefore, ""asian"" with A in position 4? Cannot be guessed? Because we know A cannot be in position 4? Similarly, we deduced A must be at position 1? So?\n\nFor ""asian"": position 4: A? But we concluded A is at position 1? And cannot be at position 4? So ""asian"" would have A at position 1 and 4, but position 4 is disallowed? So it would be invalid.\n\nTherefore, A is at position 1? So we don\'t want a duplicate at 4? Unless the secret word has two A\'s? But the position 4 for A? We already tested and got wrong? So no? Secret word has A not in position 4? So if we have a word with A at position 1 and something else at position 4? Like ""a s i o n"" but ""asion"" not word? Or ""anion"" or ""axion"".\n\nThus? ""asian"" is invalid because of possible duplicate and A in position 4? But if we don\'t have duplicate? But ""asian"" has A at position 1 and position 4? So position 4 A is disallowed? So secret word cannot have A in position 4? So ""asian"" would be incorrect? So we discard? \n\nThus only ""anion"" and ""axion""? Or ""apian""?\n\n""apian"": A,P,I,A,N → positions: A(1),P(2),I(3),A(4),N(5)? Position 4: A? But we know from ""divan"" that position 4 cannot have A? Because ""divan"" had A at 4? and it was marked wrong? So the secret word does not have A in position 4? Thus ""apian"" has A at position 4? Cannot be? So we must not guess it.\n\nTherefore, only ""anion"" and ""axion"" do not have A in position 4? They have O and X? And N and O respectively? \n\nIn ""anion"": position 4 is O? Position 2 is N? But we are testing a word that has N at position 2? But we haven\'t ruled out duplicate N? Possible.\n\nSimilarly, ""axion"": position 2 is X, position 4 is O.\n\nSo we have two choices? Now, which one to guess? Perhaps ""anion"" is more common? Or we can choose? \n\nWe can also consider ""aspin"" not a word? ""krait"" not ending N.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""anion"" as it uses more common letters? X is less common? \n\nBut actually? In Wordle, both are valid? But perhaps ""anion"" is less obscure? Or ""axion""? \n\nWe might also need to consider that the letter at position 2 and 4 might not be excluded? And we haven\'t tested O? Or X? \n\nSo to test? We can choose? Since position 2 in ""anion"" is N? But N is already known? So we wouldn\'t gain information? Whereas in ""axion"", position 2 is new letter X? Position 4 is O? Which is new? \n\nBut we can also consider? We have only tried limited letters? Exclude C,E,R,L,T,D,V? So many left? \n\nBut to maximize information? Perhaps we should guess a word that uses letters not tried? And common? \n\nThus? ""anion"" has O? But N is repeated? And we know N? So we wouldn\'t learn? But it could confirm if duplicate exists? \n\nBut ""axion"" tests X and O? Both new? \n\nBut there is no other common word? How about ""amine"" but E excluded.\n\nI think we should go with ""anion""? Because it is a valid word? And if incorrect? We get information.\n\nOr ""fagin""? But ""fagin"" ends with N? F,A,G,I,N → positions: F(1),A(2),G(3),I(4),N(5)? But A in position 2? Disallowed? And I in position 4? Also disallowed? So invalid.\n\nSimilarly? ""BEGIN"" has E? Excluded.\n\nTherefore, we decide between ""anion"" and ""axion"".\n\nSince our deduction requires the pattern A _ I _ N? So let\'s guess ""anion"".\n\nWe can feedback? I think ""anion"" is more common than ""axion"".\n\nBut both are valid, so we\'ll go with ""anion"".### Step-by-Step Thought Process\n\n1. **Reviewing Feedback from Previous Guesses:**\n   - **Guess 1 (crane):**  \n     Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(x)  \n     → Eliminates **C, R, E** from the word.  \n     → Confirms **A** and **N** are present but not in positions 3 or 4 (A was guessed in position 3, N in position 4).  \n   - **Guess 2 (latin):**  \n     Feedback: L(x) A(-) T(x) I(-) N(✓)  \n     → Eliminates **L, T** (added to exclusions: C, E, R, L, T).  \n     → Confirms **N** is in position 5 (fixed).  \n     → Confirms **A** is not in position 2 (marked wrong position).  \n     → Confirms **I** is present but not in position 4 (marked wrong position).  \n   - **Guess 3 (divan):**  \n     Feedback: D(x) I(-) V(x) A(-) N(✓)  \n     → Eliminates **D, V** (added to exclusions: C, E, R, L, T, D, V).  \n     → Confirms **N** in position 5 remains fixed.  \n     → **I** is not in position 2 (marked wrong position).  \n     → **A** is not in position 4 (marked wrong position).  \n\n2. **Consolidating Position Constraints:**\n   - **A**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3 (from guesses 1 and 2), and not in position 4 (from guess 3).

We have feedback from the fourth guess ""anion"":
- A(✓) at position 1: correct, so A is fixed at position 1.
- N(-) at position 2: N is in the word but not in position 2. Since we know N is at position 5 (from guess 2), this means there is another N? But position 2 is not N, which we already knew because in ""anion"" we put N at position 2 and it was marked wrong. But note: the feedback says N(-) for position 2, meaning N is in the word but not at position 2. But we already know N is at position 5, so this doesn't add new information about existence, only that position 2 is not N.
- I(✓) at position 3: correct, so I is fixed at position 3.
- O(✓) at position 4: correct, so O is fixed at position 4.
- N(✓) at position 5: we already knew N is at position 5, so confirmed.

So the feedback for ""anion"" is:
  Position 1: A (correct)
  Position 2: N (wrong position, but we know N is at 5, so this is consistent and tells us that the N at position 2 is not correct, but we already have N at 5, so the word must have at least two N's? Or is it the same N? But the feedback for position 2 is marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position, and position 5 is marked as correct. So if there was only one N, then the N at position 2 would be the same as the one at 5, but since position 5 is fixed, the N at position 2 would be an extra? Actually, no: the feedback for position 2 says that the letter N is in the word but not at position 2. Since we have N at position 5, that satisfies the presence. So the '-' at position 2 just means that the letter N (which is at position 5) is not at position 2. It doesn't necessarily mean there is a second N. However, the feedback symbol for position 2 is '-' which typically means that the letter is present elsewhere, not necessarily that there is a duplicate. But in this case, since we have the same letter N at two positions, and one is correct (position 5) and the other (position 2) is marked as present but wrong position, that would imply that there is a second N? Because if there was only one N (at position 5), then the N at position 2 would be marked as absent (x) because that N is not present elsewhere? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but not in that position, it's marked '-'. If the letter is not in the word at all, it's marked 'x'. 

In this case, for ""anion"":
- We have N at position 2 and N at position 5.
- The secret word has N at position 5 (so the N at position 5 is correct).
- The N at position 2: if the secret word has only one N (at position 5), then the N at position 2 should be marked as absent (x) because that occurrence of N is not in the secret word (since the only N is already at position 5). But the feedback says N at position 2 is marked as '-' (present but wrong position). This implies that the secret word must have at least two N's: one at position 5 and one elsewhere (not at position 2). Therefore, the secret word has two N's.

So from ""anion"" feedback:
- A is at position 1 (correct).
- I is at position 3 (correct).
- O is at position 4 (correct).
- N is at position 5 (correct).
- And the N at position 2 is present but wrong position, meaning there is a second N in the word (since the one at position 5 is already accounted for).

Therefore, the secret word has the following fixed:
  Position 1: A
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: O
  Position 5: N

And position 2 must be a letter that is not N (because if it were N, it would be correct, but it's marked wrong position) and also, we know the word has a second N? But wait, the second N must be at position 2? Because the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is A, 3 is I, 4 is O, 5 is N. So the only position left is 2. But we cannot put N at position 2 because the feedback says it's not there? And we have a second N to place? But there is no other position? This is a contradiction? 

Let me reexamine:

The secret word has: 
  Pos1: A (fixed)
  Pos2: ? 
  Pos3: I (fixed)
  Pos4: O (fixed)
  Pos5: N (fixed)

But the feedback for ""anion"" at position 2: we put N and got '-', meaning that N is in the word but not at position 2. But the secret word already has N at position 5. So if the secret word has only one N, then the N at position 2 in the guess should be marked as absent (x) because that N is not in the secret word (the only N is at position 5). But it was marked as present but wrong position ('-'), which means that the secret word must have an additional N (a second N) that is not at position 2. However, the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Positions 1,3,4,5 are fixed and are A, I, O, N respectively. So the only position that can hold the second N is position 2? But we cannot put N at position 2 because the feedback says it's not there? Contradiction.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the secret word does not have a second N? But then why was the N at position 2 marked as '-'? 

Alternatively, perhaps the feedback system does not mark duplicates in that way? Let me recall the rules: in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback is given per occurrence. For example, if the secret word has one N and you guess two N's, then one N will be marked as correct (if in the right position) or present (if in the wrong position) and the extra N will be marked as absent. 

In this case, the secret word has one N (at position 5). In the guess ""anion"", we have:
- Position 2: N (this is an extra N, not in the secret word) -> should be marked as absent (x)
- Position 5: N (correct) -> marked as correct (✓)

But the feedback we got for position 2 is '-' (present but wrong position), not 'x'. So that would be inconsistent if the secret word has only one N.

Therefore, the secret word must have two N's. But then, where is the second N? The positions 1,3,4,5 are fixed as A, I, O, N. So the second N must be at position 2? But the feedback says position 2 is not N? 

This is a puzzle.

Unless the fixed positions are not all correct? But we have:

From guess 2: N is at position 5 (✓)
From guess 4: A at position 1 (✓), I at position 3 (✓), O at position 4 (✓), N at position 5 (✓)

So the only position left is position 2. And we have to put a letter there. But the feedback for position 2 in ""anion"" was N and it was marked as present but wrong position. But if the secret word has two N's, one at position 5 and one at position 2, then when we put N at position 2, it should be marked as correct (✓) if it is indeed at position 2. But it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So it cannot be at position 2.

The only way out is that the secret word has two N's, but one is at position 5 and the other is at a position that is not 2. But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is A, 3 is I, 4 is O, 5 is N. So the second N must be at position 2? But then it should be marked as correct, not '-'.

This is a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in the feedback interpretation.

Let me re-read the feedback for guess 4: anion -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(-) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓)

The feedback is given per letter in the guess. The guess ""anion"" has:
  Letter 1: A -> ✓
  Letter 2: N -> -
  Letter 3: I -> ✓
  Letter 4: O -> ✓
  Letter 5: N -> ✓

The secret word is A _ I O N. The only unknown is position 2.

The feedback for the second letter (N) is '-', which means that N is in the secret word but not at position 2. But the secret word has N at position 5. So if there is only one N, then the N at position 2 in the guess should be marked as absent (x) because that specific occurrence is not in the secret word (since the only N is at position 5 and is already accounted for by the fifth letter). But it is marked as '-', which is a problem.

Therefore, the secret word must have two N's: one at position 5 and one at another position. The only possible position for the second N is position 2. But then, when we put N at position 2, it should be marked as correct (✓) because it is in the correct position. But it is marked as '-', which is wrong position. This is impossible.

Unless the feedback is not per occurrence but per letter? But in Wordle, it is per occurrence.

Perhaps the secret word has two N's, but one of them is not at position 5? But we have confirmation that position 5 is N from guess 2 and guess 4.

Another possibility: the feedback for position 2 is '-' because there is a second N at a different position, but the only position available is position 2? No.

I think there is a mistake in the feedback provided? Or in our deduction.

Let me double-check the feedback history:

Guess 2: latin -> N(✓) at position 5. So position 5 is N.
Guess 4: anion -> N(✓) at position 5, which is consistent.

In guess 4, we have N at position 2 and position 5. The secret word has at least one N at position 5. If it has only one N, then the N at position 2 should be marked as absent (x). But it is marked as present but wrong position ('-'), so there must be a second N in the secret word. But where? The only position available is position 2, but if it is at position 2, then it should be marked as correct (✓), not '-'.

This is a logical impossibility.

Unless the secret word has the second N at a position that is not 2, but we have fixed positions 1,3,4,5. For example, could position 1 be N? But position 1 is A, fixed. Position 3 is I, fixed. Position 4 is O, fixed. Position 5 is N, fixed. So no.

Perhaps the secret word has three N's? But then, in guess 4, we have two N's: one at position 2 (marked '-') and one at position 5 (marked '✓'). So the secret word would have N at position 5 and two more N's? But there are only 5 positions, and positions 1,3,4 are fixed as A, I, O. So no room for two more N's.

Therefore, the only possibility is that the feedback for position 2 in guess 4 should have been 'x' (absent) because there is only one N (at position 5). But it was given as '-', which is a mistake? Or perhaps I misread the feedback.

Looking back at the user's message: ""Guess 4: anion -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(-) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓)""

This feedback is provided by the system. We have to trust it.

Perhaps the secret word is ""AXIOM"" but that doesn't end with N.

Another idea: maybe the secret word has O at position 4 and N at position 5, but position 1 is not A? But we have A at position 1 marked as correct in guess 4.

I think there's a flaw in our earlier deduction that A must be at position 1 and I at position 3. Let me revisit that.

From guess 3 (divan): A was at position 4 and marked as '-', so A is not at position 4.
From guess 2 (latin): A was at position 2 and marked as '-', so A is not at position 2.
From guess 1 (crane): A was at position 3 and marked as '-', so A is not at position 3.
Position 5 is N, so A must be at position 1. That seems solid.

Similarly for I:
From guess 2 (latin): I was at position 4 and marked as '-', so I is not at position 4.
From guess 3 (divan): I was at position 2 and marked as '-', so I is not at position 2.
Position 5 is N, so I can only be at position 1 or 3.
But position 1 is A, so I must be at position 3.

This seems airtight.

But then the feedback for guess 4 is impossible. So the only explanation is that the secret word has two N's, and the second N is at position 2, but the feedback for position 2 in guess 4 should have been '✓', not '-'. But it was given as '-', so perhaps there's a typo in the feedback or in the word.

Perhaps ""anion"" is not the secret word, but the feedback for position 2 is '-' because the second N is at a different position, but there is no other position.

Unless the secret word has duplicate letters in a way that we haven't guessed. For example, if the secret word is ""ANNOY"", but then position 4 is O? ""ANNOY"" is A,N,N,O,Y -> positions: A(1),N(2),N(3),O(4),Y(5). But then in guess 4 ""anion"", we have A(1),N(2),I(3),O(4),N(5). 
For position 3: we have I, but the secret word has N, so it should be marked as absent or present? The secret word has no I, so I should be marked as absent. But in feedback, I is marked as correct (✓) at position 3. Contradiction.

Another secret word: ""ANION"" itself, but then position 2 should be N and marked as correct, not '-'.

I think there is a mistake in the feedback provided for guess 4. It should be: for position 2, if the secret word is ""A?ION"" with ? not N, then the N at position 2 should be marked as absent (x), not '-', because there is only one N at position 5.

But the user said: ""N(-)"" for position 2.

Perhaps the user meant 'x' but wrote '-'. But we have to work with what is given.

Maybe the secret word has a letter that is N at a different position, but we have fixed positions.

Another possibility: in guess 4, the feedback for position 2 is '-' because there is an N in the word but not at position 2, and that N is at position 5, but since position 5 is already correct, the system still marks the position 2 N as '-' to indicate that there is an N in the word (at position 5) but not at position 2. But that is not how Wordle works. In Wordle, if you have a duplicate letter in the guess and the secret word has only one, the extra is marked as absent.

For example, if secret is ""APPLE"" and you guess ""PAPER"", then the first P is marked as present (because there is a P in the secret but not at position 1), the A is correct, the second P is absent (because the secret has only one P, already matched), etc.

So in our case, if secret is ""A?ION"" with only one N at position 5, then in guess ""anion"":
- Position 1: A correct.
- Position 2: N -> absent (x) because the secret has only one N and it's at position 5, not 2.
- Position 3: I correct.
- Position 4: O correct.
- Position 5: N correct.

But the feedback says position 2 is '-', which is present but wrong position. This implies that the secret word has a second N somewhere.

But there is no room for a second N because positions 1,3,4,5 are fixed and are not N (except position 5 is N, but that's one).

Unless the secret word has N at position 5 and another N at position 2, but then position 2 should be correct.

I think we have to assume the feedback is correct and that the secret word has two N's, and the second N is not at position 2, but then where? The only possibility is that one of the fixed positions is not fixed? But that can't be.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 4 is for a different word? But the user said ""anion"".

Let's ignore the contradiction for a moment and assume the feedback is as given.

So from guess 4: A(✓) N(-) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓)

This means:
- A at 1: correct
- N at 2: present but wrong position (so there is an N not at position 2, but we know one at 5, so there must be another N)
- I at 3: correct
- O at 4: correct
- N at 5: correct

So the secret word has at least two N's: one at 5 and one at another position. The only position that can be is position 2, but then it should be correct, not '-'. 

Unless the secret word has the second N at a position that is not 2, but we have no other positions. 

Perhaps the secret word is ""ANNEX"" but then position 4 is not O.

Or ""INION"" but position 1 is I, not A.

I think there's a mistake. Perhaps in the feedback, the 'N(-)' for position 2 means that it is not in the word? But the symbol is '-', which is defined as ""in the word but wrong position"", not 'x' for absent.

In the initial rules, '-' means ""in the word but wrong position"", 'x' means not in the word.

So it must be that the secret word has two N's.

But then, the only logical conclusion is that the secret word has N at position 2 and position 5, but then in guess 4, position 2 should be marked as correct, not '-'.

This is unresolvable.

Perhaps the feedback for position 2 is for the letter, not considering the duplicate. But that's not standard.

Another idea: in some interpretations, if the secret word has one N and you guess two N's, the first N that is not in the correct position might be marked as '-', and the second N (at the correct position) as '✓', but the first N might be marked as '-' if it's in the word but not that position, but since there's only one, it should be marked as 'x' for the extra.

I think we have to proceed with the given feedback and assume that the secret word has two N's, and the second N is not at position 2, but must be at a position that is not fixed? But all positions are fixed except position 2.

Unless the fixed positions are not all occupied by the letters we think.

For example, from guess 2: N is at position 5, but in guess 4, we have O at position 4 and it is marked correct, so position 4 is O.

Similarly, position 1 is A, position 3 is I.

So no.

Perhaps the secret word is ""ANNOY"", but then position 3 is N, not I, so in guess 4, position 3 should not be I, but it is marked as correct, so it must be I.

I give up. Perhaps there is a typo in the feedback.

Maybe "" anion"" is not the guess, but the user said it is.

Another possibility: the feedback for position 2 is 'x', but the user wrote '-' by mistake. If we assume that, then the feedback would be:
  A(✓) N(x) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓)

Then it makes sense: the secret word is A _ I O N, with position 2 being a letter that is not N and not in the excluded list.

Then we can guess a word like ""audio"" but ""audio"" is 5 letters: A,U,D,I,O -> positions: A(1),U(2),D(3),I(4),O(5) -> but we need position 3=I and position 4=O, so it would be A, U, I, O, N? ""auion"" not a word.

The word must be A, ?, I, O, N.

With ? not in excluded letters and not N.

Excluded letters: C, E, R, L, T, D, V.

So available: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words: 
- "" basin"" but B,A,S,I,N -> positions: A(1),B(2),S(3),I(4),N(5) -> but we need position 3=I and position 4=O, so not.
- ""cabin"" C excluded.
- "" again"" A,G,A,I,N -> position 3=A, not I.
- ""admin"" D excluded.
- ""amino"" ends with O, not N.
- ""amigo"" not ending with N.
- ""avion"" V excluded.
- ""axion"" A,X,I,O,N -> positions: A(1),X(2),I(3),O(4),N(5) -> this fits.

So if the feedback for position 2 in ""anion"" was 'x', then ""axion"" would be the word.

Given the feedback says '-' for position 2, but perhaps it's a mistake, and we should guess ""axion"".

Or ""union"" but position 1 is U, not A.

So ""axion"" is a candidate.

Perhaps ""prion"" R excluded.

So I think we should guess ""axion"" as the next guess, hoping that the feedback for position 2 in ""anion"" was meant to be 'x' or that ""axion"" is the word.

Alternatively, if the feedback is correct as given, then we have a contradiction, so we must proceed with the information.

Perhaps the secret word is ""ONION"" but position 1 is O, not A.

Or "" anion"" with position 2 not N, but then why is position 2 N marked as '-'?

I think for the sake of continuing, we'll assume that the feedback for position 2 in ""anion"" should have been 'x', and guess ""axion"".

So the next guess is ""axion"".

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

1. **Guess 1: crane**  
   - Feedback: C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(x)  
     - Excludes **C, R, E** from the word.  
     - Confirms **A** and **N** are present but not in positions 3 or 4.

2. **Guess 2: latin**  
   - Feedback: L(x), A(-), T(x), I(-), N(✓)  
     - Excludes **L, T** (added to exclusions: C, E, R, L, T).  
     - Confirms **N** is in position 5 (fixed).  
     - Confirms **A** is not in position 2.  
     - Confirms **I** is present but not in position 4.

3. **Guess 3: divan**  
   - Feedback: D(x), I(-), V(x), A(-), N(✓)  
     - Excludes **D, V** (added to exclusions: C, E, R, L, T, D, V).  
     - Confirms **N** in position 5 remains fixed.  
     - Confirms **I** is not in position 2.  
     - Confirms **A** is not in position 4.

4. **Guess 4: anion**  
   - Feedback: A(✓), N(-), I(✓), O(✓), N(✓)  
     - Confirms **A** is fixed at position 1.  
     - Confirms **I** is fixed at position 3.  
     - Confirms **O** is fixed at position 4.  
     - Confirms **N** is fixed at position 5.  
     - **N at position 2 is marked as present but wrong position (N(-))**. This is inconsistent with the fixed positions (A at 1, I at 3, O at 4, N at 5), as there is no room for a second N. After careful review, this appears to be a feedback anomaly. Given the constraints:
       - The secret word must have **A, I, O, N** at positions 1, 3, 4, 5.
       - Position 2 must be a new letter (not N, and not excluded).
       - The N at position 2 in ""anion"" should logically be marked as absent (x) if there is no second N, but the feedback shows '-'. This suggests a potential feedback error or edge case in duplicate letter handling.
     - Proceeding with the fixed structure: **A ? I O N**, where position 2 is the only unknown.

### Deductions for the Next Guess
- **Secret word structure**: A (1) ? (2) I (3) O (4) N (5).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, E, R, L, T, D, V (from previous feedback).  
- **Position 2 constraints**: 
  - Cannot be N (feedback from guess 4 shows N is not in position 2).
  - Must be a letter not excluded and not yet tested in position 2.
- **Available letters for position 2**: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z (common unused letters: S, M, P, U, etc.).  
- **Valid word requirement**: Must be a 5-letter English word fitting **A ? I O N**.

### Selecting the Guess
- The only common word that fits the structure **A ? I O N** and avoids excluded letters is **AXION** (A, X, I, O, N).  
  - **A** at position 1: Confirmed correct.  
  - **X** at position 2: New letter, not excluded.  
  - **I** at position 3: Confirmed correct.  
  - **O** at position 4: Confirmed correct.  
  - **N** at position 5: Confirmed correct.  
- **Why AXION?**  
  - Tests the only remaining unknown (position 2) with a plausible letter (X).  
  - Resolves the feedback anomaly: If correct, it confirms the structure. If not, it provides critical data on position 2.

<guess>axion</guess>",axion,"We have feedback from the fourth guess ""anion"":
- A(✓) at position 1: correct, so A is fixed at position 1.
- N(-) at position 2: N is in the word but not in position 2. Since we know N is at position 5 (from guess 2), this means there is another N? But position 2 is not N, which we already knew because in ""anion"" we put N at position 2 and it was marked wrong. But note: the feedback says N(-) for position 2, meaning N is in the word but not at position 2. But we already know N is at position 5, so this doesn't add new information about existence, only that position 2 is not N.
- I(✓) at position 3: correct, so I is fixed at position 3.
- O(✓) at position 4: correct, so O is fixed at position 4.
- N(✓) at position 5: we already knew N is at position 5, so confirmed.

So the feedback for ""anion"" is:
  Position 1: A (correct)
  Position 2: N (wrong position, but we know N is at 5, so this is consistent and tells us that the N at position 2 is not correct, but we already have N at 5, so the word must have at least two N's? Or is it the same N? But the feedback for position 2 is marked as '-' meaning present but wrong position, and position 5 is marked as correct. So if there was only one N, then the N at position 2 would be the same as the one at 5, but since position 5 is fixed, the N at position 2 would be an extra? Actually, no: the feedback for position 2 says that the letter N is in the word but not at position 2. Since we have N at position 5, that satisfies the presence. So the '-' at position 2 just means that the letter N (which is at position 5) is not at position 2. It doesn't necessarily mean there is a second N. However, the feedback symbol for position 2 is '-' which typically means that the letter is present elsewhere, not necessarily that there is a duplicate. But in this case, since we have the same letter N at two positions, and one is correct (position 5) and the other (position 2) is marked as present but wrong position, that would imply that there is a second N? Because if there was only one N (at position 5), then the N at position 2 would be marked as absent (x) because that N is not present elsewhere? But wait, the feedback rules: if the letter is in the word but not in that position, it's marked '-'. If the letter is not in the word at all, it's marked 'x'. 

In this case, for ""anion"":
- We have N at position 2 and N at position 5.
- The secret word has N at position 5 (so the N at position 5 is correct).
- The N at position 2: if the secret word has only one N (at position 5), then the N at position 2 should be marked as absent (x) because that occurrence of N is not in the secret word (since the only N is already at position 5). But the feedback says N at position 2 is marked as '-' (present but wrong position). This implies that the secret word must have at least two N's: one at position 5 and one elsewhere (not at position 2). Therefore, the secret word has two N's.

So from ""anion"" feedback:
- A is at position 1 (correct).
- I is at position 3 (correct).
- O is at position 4 (correct).
- N is at position 5 (correct).
- And the N at position 2 is present but wrong position, meaning there is a second N in the word (since the one at position 5 is already accounted for).

Therefore, the secret word has the following fixed:
  Position 1: A
  Position 3: I
  Position 4: O
  Position 5: N

And position 2 must be a letter that is not N (because if it were N, it would be correct, but it's marked wrong position) and also, we know the word has a second N? But wait, the second N must be at position 2? Because the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is A, 3 is I, 4 is O, 5 is N. So the only position left is 2. But we cannot put N at position 2 because the feedback says it's not there? And we have a second N to place? But there is no other position? This is a contradiction? 

Let me reexamine:

The secret word has: 
  Pos1: A (fixed)
  Pos2: ? 
  Pos3: I (fixed)
  Pos4: O (fixed)
  Pos5: N (fixed)

But the feedback for ""anion"" at position 2: we put N and got '-', meaning that N is in the word but not at position 2. But the secret word already has N at position 5. So if the secret word has only one N, then the N at position 2 in the guess should be marked as absent (x) because that N is not in the secret word (the only N is at position 5). But it was marked as present but wrong position ('-'), which means that the secret word must have an additional N (a second N) that is not at position 2. However, the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Positions 1,3,4,5 are fixed and are A, I, O, N respectively. So the only position that can hold the second N is position 2? But we cannot put N at position 2 because the feedback says it's not there? Contradiction.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the secret word does not have a second N? But then why was the N at position 2 marked as '-'? 

Alternatively, perhaps the feedback system does not mark duplicates in that way? Let me recall the rules: in Wordle, if a letter appears multiple times, the feedback is given per occurrence. For example, if the secret word has one N and you guess two N's, then one N will be marked as correct (if in the right position) or present (if in the wrong position) and the extra N will be marked as absent. 

In this case, the secret word has one N (at position 5). In the guess ""anion"", we have:
- Position 2: N (this is an extra N, not in the secret word) -> should be marked as absent (x)
- Position 5: N (correct) -> marked as correct (✓)

But the feedback we got for position 2 is '-' (present but wrong position), not 'x'. So that would be inconsistent if the secret word has only one N.

Therefore, the secret word must have two N's. But then, where is the second N? The positions 1,3,4,5 are fixed as A, I, O, N. So the second N must be at position 2? But the feedback says position 2 is not N? 

This is a puzzle.

Unless the fixed positions are not all correct? But we have:

From guess 2: N is at position 5 (✓)
From guess 4: A at position 1 (✓), I at position 3 (✓), O at position 4 (✓), N at position 5 (✓)

So the only position left is position 2. And we have to put a letter there. But the feedback for position 2 in ""anion"" was N and it was marked as present but wrong position. But if the secret word has two N's, one at position 5 and one at position 2, then when we put N at position 2, it should be marked as correct (✓) if it is indeed at position 2. But it was marked as '-' meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So it cannot be at position 2.

The only way out is that the secret word has two N's, but one is at position 5 and the other is at a position that is not 2. But the only positions are 1,2,3,4,5. Position 1 is A, 3 is I, 4 is O, 5 is N. So the second N must be at position 2? But then it should be marked as correct, not '-'.

This is a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in the feedback interpretation.

Let me re-read the feedback for guess 4: anion -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(-) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓)

The feedback is given per letter in the guess. The guess ""anion"" has:
  Letter 1: A -> ✓
  Letter 2: N -> -
  Letter 3: I -> ✓
  Letter 4: O -> ✓
  Letter 5: N -> ✓

The secret word is A _ I O N. The only unknown is position 2.

The feedback for the second letter (N) is '-', which means that N is in the secret word but not at position 2. But the secret word has N at position 5. So if there is only one N, then the N at position 2 in the guess should be marked as absent (x) because that specific occurrence is not in the secret word (since the only N is at position 5 and is already accounted for by the fifth letter). But it is marked as '-', which is a problem.

Therefore, the secret word must have two N's: one at position 5 and one at another position. The only possible position for the second N is position 2. But then, when we put N at position 2, it should be marked as correct (✓) because it is in the correct position. But it is marked as '-', which is wrong position. This is impossible.

Unless the feedback is not per occurrence but per letter? But in Wordle, it is per occurrence.

Perhaps the secret word has two N's, but one of them is not at position 5? But we have confirmation that position 5 is N from guess 2 and guess 4.

Another possibility: the feedback for position 2 is '-' because there is a second N at a different position, but the only position available is position 2? No.

I think there is a mistake in the feedback provided? Or in our deduction.

Let me double-check the feedback history:

Guess 2: latin -> N(✓) at position 5. So position 5 is N.
Guess 4: anion -> N(✓) at position 5, which is consistent.

In guess 4, we have N at position 2 and position 5. The secret word has at least one N at position 5. If it has only one N, then the N at position 2 should be marked as absent (x). But it is marked as present but wrong position ('-'), so there must be a second N in the secret word. But where? The only position available is position 2, but if it is at position 2, then it should be marked as correct (✓), not '-'.

This is a logical impossibility.

Unless the secret word has the second N at a position that is not 2, but we have fixed positions 1,3,4,5. For example, could position 1 be N? But position 1 is A, fixed. Position 3 is I, fixed. Position 4 is O, fixed. Position 5 is N, fixed. So no.

Perhaps the secret word has three N's? But then, in guess 4, we have two N's: one at position 2 (marked '-') and one at position 5 (marked '✓'). So the secret word would have N at position 5 and two more N's? But there are only 5 positions, and positions 1,3,4 are fixed as A, I, O. So no room for two more N's.

Therefore, the only possibility is that the feedback for position 2 in guess 4 should have been 'x' (absent) because there is only one N (at position 5). But it was given as '-', which is a mistake? Or perhaps I misread the feedback.

Looking back at the user's message: ""Guess 4: anion -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(-) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓)""

This feedback is provided by the system. We have to trust it.

Perhaps the secret word is ""AXIOM"" but that doesn't end with N.

Another idea: maybe the secret word has O at position 4 and N at position 5, but position 1 is not A? But we have A at position 1 marked as correct in guess 4.

I think there's a flaw in our earlier deduction that A must be at position 1 and I at position 3. Let me revisit that.

From guess 3 (divan): A was at position 4 and marked as '-', so A is not at position 4.
From guess 2 (latin): A was at position 2 and marked as '-', so A is not at position 2.
From guess 1 (crane): A was at position 3 and marked as '-', so A is not at position 3.
Position 5 is N, so A must be at position 1. That seems solid.

Similarly for I:
From guess 2 (latin): I was at position 4 and marked as '-', so I is not at position 4.
From guess 3 (divan): I was at position 2 and marked as '-', so I is not at position 2.
Position 5 is N, so I can only be at position 1 or 3.
But position 1 is A, so I must be at position 3.

This seems airtight.

But then the feedback for guess 4 is impossible. So the only explanation is that the secret word has two N's, and the second N is at position 2, but the feedback for position 2 in guess 4 should have been '✓', not '-'. But it was given as '-', so perhaps there's a typo in the feedback or in the word.

Perhaps ""anion"" is not the secret word, but the feedback for position 2 is '-' because the second N is at a different position, but there is no other position.

Unless the secret word has duplicate letters in a way that we haven't guessed. For example, if the secret word is ""ANNOY"", but then position 4 is O? ""ANNOY"" is A,N,N,O,Y -> positions: A(1),N(2),N(3),O(4),Y(5). But then in guess 4 ""anion"", we have A(1),N(2),I(3),O(4),N(5). 
For position 3: we have I, but the secret word has N, so it should be marked as absent or present? The secret word has no I, so I should be marked as absent. But in feedback, I is marked as correct (✓) at position 3. Contradiction.

Another secret word: ""ANION"" itself, but then position 2 should be N and marked as correct, not '-'.

I think there is a mistake in the feedback provided for guess 4. It should be: for position 2, if the secret word is ""A?ION"" with ? not N, then the N at position 2 should be marked as absent (x), not '-', because there is only one N at position 5.

But the user said: ""N(-)"" for position 2.

Perhaps the user meant 'x' but wrote '-'. But we have to work with what is given.

Maybe the secret word has a letter that is N at a different position, but we have fixed positions.

Another possibility: in guess 4, the feedback for position 2 is '-' because there is an N in the word but not at position 2, and that N is at position 5, but since position 5 is already correct, the system still marks the position 2 N as '-' to indicate that there is an N in the word (at position 5) but not at position 2. But that is not how Wordle works. In Wordle, if you have a duplicate letter in the guess and the secret word has only one, the extra is marked as absent.

For example, if secret is ""APPLE"" and you guess ""PAPER"", then the first P is marked as present (because there is a P in the secret but not at position 1), the A is correct, the second P is absent (because the secret has only one P, already matched), etc.

So in our case, if secret is ""A?ION"" with only one N at position 5, then in guess ""anion"":
- Position 1: A correct.
- Position 2: N -> absent (x) because the secret has only one N and it's at position 5, not 2.
- Position 3: I correct.
- Position 4: O correct.
- Position 5: N correct.

But the feedback says position 2 is '-', which is present but wrong position. This implies that the secret word has a second N somewhere.

But there is no room for a second N because positions 1,3,4,5 are fixed and are not N (except position 5 is N, but that's one).

Unless the secret word has N at position 5 and another N at position 2, but then position 2 should be correct.

I think we have to assume the feedback is correct and that the secret word has two N's, and the second N is not at position 2, but then where? The only possibility is that one of the fixed positions is not fixed? But that can't be.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 4 is for a different word? But the user said ""anion"".

Let's ignore the contradiction for a moment and assume the feedback is as given.

So from guess 4: A(✓) N(-) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓)

This means:
- A at 1: correct
- N at 2: present but wrong position (so there is an N not at position 2, but we know one at 5, so there must be another N)
- I at 3: correct
- O at 4: correct
- N at 5: correct

So the secret word has at least two N's: one at 5 and one at another position. The only position that can be is position 2, but then it should be correct, not '-'. 

Unless the secret word has the second N at a position that is not 2, but we have no other positions. 

Perhaps the secret word is ""ANNEX"" but then position 4 is not O.

Or ""INION"" but position 1 is I, not A.

I think there's a mistake. Perhaps in the feedback, the 'N(-)' for position 2 means that it is not in the word? But the symbol is '-', which is defined as ""in the word but wrong position"", not 'x' for absent.

In the initial rules, '-' means ""in the word but wrong position"", 'x' means not in the word.

So it must be that the secret word has two N's.

But then, the only logical conclusion is that the secret word has N at position 2 and position 5, but then in guess 4, position 2 should be marked as correct, not '-'.

This is unresolvable.

Perhaps the feedback for position 2 is for the letter, not considering the duplicate. But that's not standard.

Another idea: in some interpretations, if the secret word has one N and you guess two N's, the first N that is not in the correct position might be marked as '-', and the second N (at the correct position) as '✓', but the first N might be marked as '-' if it's in the word but not that position, but since there's only one, it should be marked as 'x' for the extra.

I think we have to proceed with the given feedback and assume that the secret word has two N's, and the second N is not at position 2, but must be at a position that is not fixed? But all positions are fixed except position 2.

Unless the fixed positions are not all occupied by the letters we think.

For example, from guess 2: N is at position 5, but in guess 4, we have O at position 4 and it is marked correct, so position 4 is O.

Similarly, position 1 is A, position 3 is I.

So no.

Perhaps the secret word is ""ANNOY"", but then position 3 is N, not I, so in guess 4, position 3 should not be I, but it is marked as correct, so it must be I.

I give up. Perhaps there is a typo in the feedback.

Maybe "" anion"" is not the guess, but the user said it is.

Another possibility: the feedback for position 2 is 'x', but the user wrote '-' by mistake. If we assume that, then the feedback would be:
  A(✓) N(x) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓)

Then it makes sense: the secret word is A _ I O N, with position 2 being a letter that is not N and not in the excluded list.

Then we can guess a word like ""audio"" but ""audio"" is 5 letters: A,U,D,I,O -> positions: A(1),U(2),D(3),I(4),O(5) -> but we need position 3=I and position 4=O, so it would be A, U, I, O, N? ""auion"" not a word.

The word must be A, ?, I, O, N.

With ? not in excluded letters and not N.

Excluded letters: C, E, R, L, T, D, V.

So available: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z.

Possible words: 
- "" basin"" but B,A,S,I,N -> positions: A(1),B(2),S(3),I(4),N(5) -> but we need position 3=I and position 4=O, so not.
- ""cabin"" C excluded.
- "" again"" A,G,A,I,N -> position 3=A, not I.
- ""admin"" D excluded.
- ""amino"" ends with O, not N.
- ""amigo"" not ending with N.
- ""avion"" V excluded.
- ""axion"" A,X,I,O,N -> positions: A(1),X(2),I(3),O(4),N(5) -> this fits.

So if the feedback for position 2 in ""anion"" was 'x', then ""axion"" would be the word.

Given the feedback says '-' for position 2, but perhaps it's a mistake, and we should guess ""axion"".

Or ""union"" but position 1 is U, not A.

So ""axion"" is a candidate.

Perhaps ""prion"" R excluded.

So I think we should guess ""axion"" as the next guess, hoping that the feedback for position 2 in ""anion"" was meant to be 'x' or that ""axion"" is the word.

Alternatively, if the feedback is correct as given, then we have a contradiction, so we must proceed with the information.

Perhaps the secret word is ""ONION"" but position 1 is O, not A.

Or "" anion"" with position 2 not N, but then why is position 2 N marked as '-'?

I think for the sake of continuing, we'll assume that the feedback for position 2 in ""anion"" should have been 'x', and guess ""axion"".

So the next guess is ""axion"".### Analysis of Previous Feedback

4. **Guess 4: anion**  
   - Feedback: A(✓), N(-), I(✓), O(✓), N(✓)  
     - Confirms **A** is fixed at position 1.  
     - Confirms **I** is fixed at position 3.  
     - Confirms **O** is fixed at position 4.  
     - Confirms **N** is fixed at position 5.  
     - **N at position 2 is marked as present but wrong position (N(-))**. This is inconsistent with the fixed positions (A at 1, I at 3, O at 4, N at 5), as there is no room for a second N. After careful review, this appears to be a feedback anomaly. Given the constraints:
       - The secret word must have **A, I, O, N** at positions 1, 3, 4, 5.
       - Position 2 must be a new letter (not N, and not excluded).
       - The N at position 2 in ""anion"" should logically be marked as absent (x) if there is no second N, but the feedback shows '-'. This suggests a potential feedback error or edge case in duplicate letter handling.
     - Proceeding with the fixed structure: **A ? I O N**, where position 2 is the only unknown.

### Deductions for the Next Guess
- **Secret word structure**: A (1) ? (2) I (3) O (4) N (5).  
- **Excluded letters**: C, E, R, L, T, D, V (from previous feedback).  
- **Position 2 constraints**: 
  - Cannot be N (feedback from guess 4 shows N is not in position 2).
  - Must be a letter not excluded and not yet tested in position 2.
- **Available letters for position 2**: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, S, U, W, X, Y, Z (common unused letters: S, M, P, U, etc.).  
- **Valid word requirement**: Must be a 5-letter English word fitting **A ? I O N**.

### Selecting the Guess
- The only common word that fits the structure **A ? I O N** and avoids excluded letters is **AXION** (A, X, I, O, N).  
  - **A** at position 1: Confirmed correct.  
  - **X** at position 2: New letter, not excluded.  
  - **I** at position 3: Confirmed correct.  
  - **O** at position 4: Confirmed correct.  
  - **N** at position 5: Confirmed correct.  
- **Why AXION?**  
  - Tests the only remaining unknown (position 2) with a plausible letter (X).  
  - Resolves the feedback anomaly: If correct, it confirms the structure. If not, it provides critical data on position 2.",Guess 5: axion -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) X(✓) I(✓) O(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
