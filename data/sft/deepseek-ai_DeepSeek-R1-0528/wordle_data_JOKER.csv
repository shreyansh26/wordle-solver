We are making the first guess. There's no prior feedback to go on, so we want to pick a word that can provide a lot of information.
 Common strategies for the first word include using words with common letters and letters that are distinct to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback.
 For example, words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are often chosen because they contain common vowels and consonants.
 However, note that the game uses English 5-letter words.

 Let me think of a word that has letters that frequently appear in English words.
 Some popular starting words: ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"". 

 I'll choose ""RAISE"": 
   - It has two vowels (A, I, E) and three consonants (R, S) which are common.
   - It has distinct letters so we get information about five different letters.

We previously guessed RAISE and got feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- R is in the word but not in the first position.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the last position? Note: In RAISE, E is the fifth letter, so the feedback E(-) means E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Important deductions:
1. The letters A, I, S are ABSENT from the secret word. So we must avoid words containing A, I, or S.
2. R and E are present in the word, but:
   - R is not in position 1 (where we guessed it).
   - E is not in position 5 (where we guessed it).

We know the secret word contains R and E, but not A, I, S.

Since there are no other letters reported, the word must consist of letters other than A, I, S. But note: we might have missed letters that weren't in RAISE.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Excludes A, I, S.
- Includes R and E (since they are present).
- Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

Additionally, we want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also consider that perhaps the word has double letters? But since we got only two ""presents"" (R and E) and three absent (A,I,S), the word might have other letters we haven't tested.

We have 6 tries, so we need to cover more ground.

Idea: Use a word that has R and E in positions other than 1 and 5, and include three new common consonants.

But note: position matters. We know R can't be first, E can't be last.

Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5 (or possibly 1? no, because we got R(-) meaning it's misplaced, so not position 1). Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.

Also, since R and E are both in the word, we can try to put them in positions we haven't ruled out.

For example, if we put R in position 2, but we don't know if that's correct. We want to minimize conflicts.

Let's think of words without A,I,S, and containing R and E.

First, avoid A,I,S.

Consider vowels: we know the word does not contain A or I, so the vowels can only be E (which we have), O, U, and sometimes Y.

We already know E is in the word. What other vowels might be present? Let's try to include O and U to test.

Some words that come to mind:

Option: PRONE? But P is new and O is new. However, PRONE: 
- P, R, O, N, E
But E is in position 5? We can't put E in position 5 because our feedback said E is not in position 5. But PRONE puts E in position 5 -> that's invalid. We must avoid putting E at the end.

Option: RENEW? But has E twice? Also, S? No, avoid S. RENEW has double E? But not in the database necessarily.

List of words with R and E, excluding A,I,S:

We can try words like:
- BERGY: but not a common word? 
- Other words: CLEAR? But CLEAR has A -> invalid because A is ruled out.

Let me think: 
- ""OLDER"": O,L,D,E,R -> letters: O,L,D,E,R -> contains R and E, and E not at end? O L D E R -> E is at position 4? Position indices: 1:O, 2:L, 3:D, 4:E, 5:R -> E is at 4 and R at 5. But we don't know about R position? We know R cannot be at position 1, but position 5 is okay? Similarly, E cannot be at position 5? Our feedback E(-) meant it was present but not in position 5. So in this case, position 4 is okay for E? Yes, and R at 5? We haven't ruled out R at 5? The feedback R(-) said R is not at position 1? So position 5 may be possible? Also, we haven't tested R at 5.

But note: in OLDER, E is at 4 and R at 5. Since E is not at 5, that's okay. R at 5: we don't have information against that.

Alternatively, ""RECUT"": R,E,C,U,T -> R at 1? Can we put R at first? Our feedback said R is not in position 1? Since RAISE had R at first and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not position 1. Therefore, we cannot put R at position 1 again.

So in RECUT, if we put it as first guess with R at 1, it would violate? So avoid words starting with R.

Similarly, E cannot be at position 5. So our guess must not start with R and not end with E.

So back to OLDER: 
- It ends with R? Position 5: R is the fifth letter? We can do that? Because R not at position 1 is allowed at position 5?

But note: O L D E R -> positions:
1: O (new)
2: L (new)
3: D (new)
4: E (which we know is present, but we are putting at 4 -> not 5, so okay)
5: R (which we know is present? But we don't know about position 5? We only know R is not at position 1? Position 5 could be okay? But we haven't guessed R at 5 yet? So it might be correct or not? We'll get feedback.)

Also, all letters are new except R and E? We are introducing O, L, D, and R and E? Actually we are retesting E? But that's fine.

But the word must have exactly the letters including R and E? And others? OLDER seems a valid word? It means someone who is old.

But let me confirm: OLDER is an English word, yes.

Other options: 
- ""BERET"": has E twice? But that's okay? But BERET: B E R E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:E, 5:T -> E at position 2 and 4? So we can test E? But the feedback already told us E is in the word? And E(-) means not at position 5? We put E at positions 2 and 4? Which is fine? But BERET has double E? That could be possible.

But BERET contains E multiple times? And the secret word might have two E? Or one? We don't know? Our feedback from RAISE had only one E reported? But that could be because there is one E? Or if there are two Es, and one was in a wrong position? In RAISE, E was at position 5? But we got E(-) meaning E is present? But if the secret word had E elsewhere? But the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple letters? Wait, normally in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess it once and it's correct? Actually, let me recall the rules? Our rules are: 
- ✓: correct letter and position
- -: letter in the word but wrong position
- x: letter not in word

Also, if you guess a letter not repeated, and it appears once in the secret? But if you guess a letter that appears twice? You get feedback accordingly? But in this case, RAISE has only one E? And we got E(-)? So the secret word has E? But if it has two Es? We don't know? Because we only guessed one? Similarly, if the secret word has only one E, that's fine.

So multiple occurrences are possible? But we don't know? We can't assume? So BERET might be a valid word? But it contains E twice? But that's okay? It's a word! Also, we avoid A,I,S? BERET excludes those? Yes.

However, BERET: 
- We put E at position 2? Could E be at position 2? We don't know? And E at position 4? Similarly, R at position 3? We don't know.

But also note: in BERET, position 3: R? Could be? Because R is not at position 1? Position 3 is allowed? 

But let me compare OLDER and BERET? We want to maximize information? OLDER: O,L,D,E,R -> five new letters? Actually E and R are repeats? But we also introduce O,L,D? That's three new consonants? 

Similarly, BERET has B, E, R, E, T? So letters: B,E,R,T? With E repeated? So effectively testing B, E, R, T? and E? So not as efficient? Because we use a letter slot for E again? 

Alternatively, how about ""ENTER""? But that has E at position 1 and 4? And N,T? And R at 5? But E at position 1? That could be? Because we don't have information against E at position 1? Our feedback was only that E is not at position 5? Position 1 is open? But ENTER ends with R? position 5? But let's see: E at 1: not tested before? However, we also have R at 5? 

But ENTER? The word? Yes? 

But perhaps better is to avoid putting E at position 1 until we know? Because we have E? Already? And R? 

I think OLDER is a good candidate? Because:
- It doesn't start with R? Correct? OLDER starts with O?
- It has E at position 4? Not 5? 
- It has R at position 5? Which we haven't tried? 
- We introduce O, L, D? Which are common? 

So OLDER: O (position 1? new), L (2? new), D (3? new), E (4? we know E is present now at 4? must not be 5?), R (5? known letter? but new position?).

But we have confirmed E is in the word? So putting E at position 4? If it is correct? We get ✓? Or if it should be elsewhere? We get -? 

Similarly? R at 5? could be correct? 

Now? another word? ""CORED"": C,O,R,E,D? But that has R at position 3? and E at position 4? And ends with D? So E not at 5? acceptable? 

But let me see? which one gives better coverage: OLDER or similar? 

I also think about words that have R not at position 1? E not at position 5? and include common letters? 

For example? ""PROTE"": not a word? How about ""TRIED"": but T? R? I? no? we cannot use I because we ruled out I? TRIED has I? invalid? 

Another: ""CRONE"": C,R,O,N,E? but E at position 5? which is forbidden? Cannot guess? so if we guess CRONE? with E at 5? the feedback would immediately flag as wrong because E cannot be there? 

Similarly? words ending with E are bad? 

So? let's choose OLDER? 

What about ""RODEO"": but that has A? O? and sometimes Y? not? RODEO: R,O,D,E,O -> has O twice? and E at position 4? but we have R at position 1? we cannot put R at position 1? because our feedback said R not at 1? 

So R must be placed differently? 

Therefore? OLDER? Let's write it:

OLDER: 
Position 1: O? new 
Position 2: L? new 
Position 3: D? new 
Position 4: E? known? 
Position 5: R? known? 

But note: what if the secret word has R at position 5? But that might be? 

Alternatively? a word with R at position 2? E elsewhere? 

For example? ""TREAD"": but A is invalid? 

""URBED"": not common? 

""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T? E at position 3? and ends with T? so E not at 5? acceptable? but R is at position 2? Position indices: 1:C,2:R,3:E,4:P,5:T? 
Can we put R at position 2? Yes? because we only ruled out position 1? 

But CREPT? is that a word? Crept is the past tense of creep? yes? 

Similarly? CREPT: letters are C,R,E,P,T? all valid? no S,A,I? 

And we introduce C,R,E,P,T? but R and E are already known? So new letters: C,P,T? 
Compared to OLDER? OLDER introduces O,L,D? 

Both introduce three new letters? 

But CREPT has E at position 3? which may be less common? or more? 

I think OLDER is fine? but CREPT also? 

Another option: ""OPTER"": not common? 

""BLUER"": but has U? and ends with R? but B,L,U,E,R? U test? 

But perhaps we should avoid vowels? we already know about E? and A,I are out? so O and U are possible? 

I think both OLDER and CREPT are acceptable? 

I'll go with CREPT? wait? let's compare:

OLDER: if we guess OLDER and secret word has E elsewhere? then E at 4 would show -? and R at 5? similarly? 

But we want to test new letters? 

Another word? ""THREW"": T,H,R,E,W? has E at position 4? and R at position 3? 

THREW? T(1),H(2),R(3),E(4),W(5)? So E not at 5? okay? and R not at 1? okay? 

And letters: T,H,R,E,W? introduce T? H? W? plus R and E? 

That's three new letters? 

Similarly? 

But perhaps THREW is common? 

After consideration? I choose CREPT? because C,P,T? are common? and CREPT is a word? 

But CREPT: 
C(1)? new 
R(2)? known? but at new position? 
E(3)? known? at new position? 
P(4)? new 
T(5)? new 

This also? not at forbidden positions? 

Now? since E in RAISE was at position 5? and we said E is present? so it's likely in another position? we have many possibilities? 

I will go with CREPT. I think it covers with R at position 2? E at position 3? which weren't tested? 

So let's decide: CREPT? 

But RE is consecutive? might be less likely? but we don't know? 

Alternatively? another word? like ""CORBY"": not common? 

""GONER"": has E? ends with R? E is at position 4? O,K? but G O N E R? 
Position: 1:G?2:O?3:N?4:E?5:R -> E not at 5? acceptable? 
And letters: G?O?N?E?R? introduce G?O?N? 
But we have E at same position? 

The point is: both are valid? 

But after more thought: it might be better to cover more common? 
So OLDER? CREPT? THREW? BERET? 

I think CREPT or THREW? 

Let me pick THREW? 

Wait? no? because I don't know? 

Alternatively? let's choose a word containing R and E and other letters? I'll go with ""THREW""?

But THREW: T H R E W? 
T at 1? H at 2? R at 3? E at 4? W at 5? 
We introduce T,H,W? and R and E? 
E not at 5? good.

Similarly? we can consider ""DETER"": but has E twice? D? E? T? E? R? 
Letters: D?E?T?E?R? so D,T,R,E? 
But we already know E? and DETER? E at position 2 and 4? 
But it's a word? 

Perhaps THREW is better? 

I think THREW is a good choice? 

But what about vowel? we tested many? only E? and secret might have O? or U? 

In RAISE? we had vowels A? I? E? but only E is present? so the word contains E? and possibly no other vowels? or with consonants? 

For example? ""THREW"" has E? so it tests E? 

So? I'll use THREW? 

But note: THREW has no O? which is a vowel? we don't know if O is present? 

But we want to test common consonants? 

Another word? ""PROBE"": has O? not A? I? S? P R O B E? 
Letters: P?R?O?B?E? 
And E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5 because feedback already showed E is not at position 5? 
Thus? ""PROBE"" would have E at position 5? which is not allowed? so it's a bad guess? 

Therefore? avoid ending in E? 

So ""CRONE"" is bad? etc? 

So THREW? we can do? 

THREW:
Guessing THREW? 

<guess>THREW</guess> 

But let me finalize? 

I think it's fine? 

Let me go with ""THREW"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R and E are present in the secret word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- A, I, and S are absent from the word.

The new guess must:
- Exclude A, I, and S.
- Include R (any position except 1) and E (any position except 5).
- Test new common consonants to gather more information.

Reasoning step by step:
1. **Avoid forbidden positions**: Since R cannot be in position 1 and E cannot be in position 5, the guess must place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
2. **Introduce new letters**: Choose high-frequency consonants like T, H, W, N, L, or D to maximize information gain. Vowels are limited (only O, U, or Y are possible besides E, as A and I are ruled out).
3. **Word selection**: ""THREW"" is suitable because:
   - It includes E (position 4) and R (position 3), avoiding the forbidden positions.
   - It introduces T, H, W—new letters for further testing.
   - It contains no A, I, or S.
   - It's a valid English word and helps position R and E in new slots.

This guess will help confirm positions for R and E while testing three new letters.

<guess>THREW</guess>",THREW,"We previously guessed RAISE and got feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- R is in the word but not in the first position.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the last position? Note: In RAISE, E is the fifth letter, so the feedback E(-) means E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Important deductions:
1. The letters A, I, S are ABSENT from the secret word. So we must avoid words containing A, I, or S.
2. R and E are present in the word, but:
   - R is not in position 1 (where we guessed it).

Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5 (or possibly 1? no, because we got R(-) meaning it's misplaced, so not position 1). Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.

Also, since R and E are both in the word, we can try to put them in positions we haven't ruled out.

For example, if we put R in position 2, but we don't know if that's correct. We want to minimize conflicts.

Let's think of words without A,I,S, and containing R and E.

First, avoid A,I,S.

Consider vowels: we know the word does not contain A or I, so the vowels can only be E (which we have), O, U, and sometimes Y.

We already know E is in the word. What other vowels might be present? Let's try to include O and U to test.

Some words that come to mind:

Option: PRONE? But P is new and O is new. However, PRONE: 
- P, R, O, N, E
But E is in position 5? We can't put E in position 5 because our feedback said E is not in position 5. But PRONE puts E in position 5 -> that's invalid. We must avoid putting E at the end.

Option: RENEW? But has E twice? Also, S? No, avoid S. RENEW has double E? But not in the database necessarily.

List of words with R and E, excluding A,I,S:

We can try words like:
- BERGY: but not a common word? 
- Other words: CLEAR? But CLEAR has A -> invalid because A is ruled out.

Let me think: 
- ""OLDER"": O,L,D,E,R -> letters: O,L,D,E,R -> contains R and E, and E not at end? O L D E R -> E is at position 4? Position indices: 1:O, 2:L, 3:D, 4:E, 5:R -> E is at 4 and R at 5. But we don't know about R position? We know R cannot be at position 1, but position 5 is okay? Similarly, E cannot be at position 5? Our feedback E(-) meant it was present but not in position 5. So in this case, position 4 is okay for E? Yes, and R at 5? We haven't ruled out R at 5? The feedback R(-) said R is not at position 1? So position 5 may be possible? Also, we haven't tested R at 5.

But note: in OLDER, E is at 4 and R at 5. Since E is not at 5, that's okay. R at 5: we don't have information against that.

Alternatively, ""RECUT"": R,E,C,U,T -> R at 1? Can we put R at first? Our feedback said R is not in position 1? Since RAISE had R at first and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not position 1. Therefore, we cannot put R at position 1 again.

So in RECUT, if we put it as first guess with R at 1, it would violate? So avoid words starting with R.

Similarly, E cannot be at position 5. So our guess must not start with R and not end with E.

So back to OLDER: 
- It ends with R? Position 5: R is the fifth letter? We can do that? Because R not at position 1 is allowed at position 5?

But note: O L D E R -> positions:
1: O (new)
2: L (new)
3: D (new)
4: E (which we know is present, but we are putting at 4 -> not 5, so okay)
5: R (which we know is present? But we don't know about position 5? We only know R is not at position 1? Position 5 could be okay? But we haven't guessed R at 5 yet? So it might be correct or not? We'll get feedback.)

Also, all letters are new except R and E? We are introducing O, L, D, and R and E? Actually we are retesting E? But that's fine.

But the word must have exactly the letters including R and E? And others? OLDER seems a valid word? It means someone who is old.

But let me confirm: OLDER is an English word, yes.

Other options: 
- ""BERET"": has E twice? But that's okay? But BERET: B E R E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:E, 5:T -> E at position 2 and 4? So we can test E? But the feedback already told us E is in the word? And E(-) means not at position 5? We put E at positions 2 and 4? Which is fine? But BERET has double E? That could be possible.

But BERET contains E multiple times? And the secret word might have two E? Or one? We don't know? Our feedback from RAISE had only one E reported? But that could be because there is one E? Or if there are two Es, and one was in a wrong position? In RAISE, E was at position 5? But we got E(-) meaning E is present? But if the secret word had E elsewhere? But the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple letters? Wait, normally in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess it once and it's correct? Actually, let me recall the rules? Our rules are: 
- ✓: correct letter and position
- -: letter in the word but wrong position
- x: letter not in word

Also, if you guess a letter not repeated, and it appears once in the secret? But if you guess a letter that appears twice? You get feedback accordingly? But in this case, RAISE has only one E? And we got E(-)? So the secret word has E? But if it has two Es? We don't know? Because we only guessed one? Similarly, if the secret word has only one E, that's fine.

So multiple occurrences are possible? But we don't know? We can't assume? So BERET might be a valid word? But it contains E twice? But that's okay? It's a word! Also, we avoid A,I,S? BERET excludes those? Yes.

However, BERET: 
- We put E at position 2? Could E be at position 2? We don't know? And E at position 4? Similarly, R at position 3? We don't know.

But also note: in BERET, position 3: R? Could be? Because R is not at position 1? Position 3 is allowed? 

But let me compare OLDER and BERET? We want to maximize information? OLDER: O,L,D,E,R -> five new letters? Actually E and R are repeats? But we also introduce O,L,D? That's three new consonants? 

Similarly, BERET has B, E, R, E, T? So letters: B,E,R,T? With E repeated? So effectively testing B, E, R, T? and E? So not as efficient? Because we use a letter slot for E again? 

Alternatively, how about ""ENTER""? But that has E at position 1 and 4? And N,T? And R at 5? But E at position 1? That could be? Because we don't have information against E at position 1? Our feedback was only that E is not at position 5? Position 1 is open? But ENTER ends with R? position 5? But let's see: E at 1: not tested before? However, we also have R at 5? 

But ENTER? The word? Yes? 

But perhaps better is to avoid putting E at position 1 until we know? Because we have E? Already? And R? 

I think OLDER is a good candidate? Because:
- It doesn't start with R? Correct? OLDER starts with O?
- It has E at position 4? Not 5? 
- It has R at position 5? Which we haven't tried? 
- We introduce O, L, D? Which are common? 

So OLDER: O (position 1? new), L (2? new), D (3? new), E (4? we know E is present now at 4? must not be 5?), R (5? known letter? but new position?).

But we have confirmed E is in the word? So putting E at position 4? If it is correct? We get ✓? Or if it should be elsewhere? We get -? 

Similarly? R at 5? could be correct? 

Now? another word? ""CORED"": C,O,R,E,D? But that has R at position 3? and E at position 4? And ends with D? So E not at 5? acceptable? 

But let me see? which one gives better coverage: OLDER or similar? 

I also think about words that have R not at position 1? E not at position 5? and include common letters? 

For example? ""PROTE"": not a word? How about ""TRIED"": but T? R? I? no? we cannot use I because we ruled out I? TRIED has I? invalid? 

Another: ""CRONE"": C,R,O,N,E? but E at position 5? which is forbidden? Cannot guess? so if we guess CRONE? with E at 5? the feedback would immediately flag as wrong because E cannot be there? 

Similarly? words ending with E are bad? 

So? let's choose OLDER? 

What about ""RODEO"": but that has A? O? and sometimes Y? not? RODEO: R,O,D,E,O -> has O twice? and E at position 4? but we have R at position 1? we cannot put R at position 1? because our feedback said R not at 1? 

So R must be placed differently? 

Therefore? OLDER? Let's write it:

OLDER: 
Position 1: O? new 
Position 2: L? new 
Position 3: D? new 
Position 4: E? known? 
Position 5: R? known? 

But note: what if the secret word has R at position 5? But that might be? 

Alternatively? a word with R at position 2? E elsewhere? 

For example? ""TREAD"": but A is invalid? 

""URBED"": not common? 

""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T? E at position 3? and ends with T? so E not at 5? acceptable? but R is at position 2? Position indices: 1:C,2:R,3:E,4:P,5:T? 
Can we put R at position 2? Yes? because we only ruled out position 1? 

But CREPT? is that a word? Crept is the past tense of creep? yes? 

Similarly? CREPT: letters are C,R,E,P,T? all valid? no S,A,I? 

And we introduce C,R,E,P,T? but R and E are already known? So new letters: C,P,T? 
Compared to OLDER? OLDER introduces O,L,D? 

Both introduce three new letters? 

But CREPT has E at position 3? which may be less common? or more? 

I think OLDER is fine? but CREPT also? 

Another option: ""OPTER"": not common? 

""BLUER"": but has U? and ends with R? but B,L,U,E,R? U test? 

But perhaps we should avoid vowels? we already know about E? and A,I are out? so O and U are possible? 

I think both OLDER and CREPT are acceptable? 

I'll go with CREPT? wait? let's compare:

OLDER: if we guess OLDER and secret word has E elsewhere? then E at 4 would show -? and R at 5? similarly? 

But we want to test new letters? 

Another word? ""THREW"": T,H,R,E,W? has E at position 4? and R at position 3? 

THREW? T(1),H(2),R(3),E(4),W(5)? So E not at 5? okay? and R not at 1? okay? 

And letters: T,H,R,E,W? introduce T? H? W? plus R and E? 

That's three new letters? 

Similarly? 

But perhaps THREW is common? 

After consideration? I choose CREPT? because C,P,T? are common? and CREPT is a word? 

But CREPT: 
C(1)? new 
R(2)? known? but at new position? 
E(3)? known? at new position? 
P(4)? new 
T(5)? new 

This also? not at forbidden positions? 

Now? since E in RAISE was at position 5? and we said E is present? so it's likely in another position? we have many possibilities? 

I will go with CREPT. I think it covers with R at position 2? E at position 3? which weren't tested? 

So let's decide: CREPT? 

But RE is consecutive? might be less likely? but we don't know? 

Alternatively? another word? like ""CORBY"": not common? 

""GONER"": has E? ends with R? E is at position 4? O,K? but G O N E R? 
Position: 1:G?2:O?3:N?4:E?5:R -> E not at 5? acceptable? 
And letters: G?O?N?E?R? introduce G?O?N? 
But we have E at same position? 

The point is: both are valid? 

But after more thought: it might be better to cover more common? 
So OLDER? CREPT? THREW? BERET? 

I think CREPT or THREW? 

Let me pick THREW? 

Wait? no? because I don't know? 

Alternatively? let's choose a word containing R and E and other letters? I'll go with ""THREW""?

But THREW: T H R E W? 
T at 1? H at 2? R at 3? E at 4? W at 5? 
We introduce T,H,W? and R and E? 
E not at 5? good.

Similarly? we can consider ""DETER"": but has E twice? D? E? T? E? R? 
Letters: D?E?T?E?R? so D,T,R,E? 
But we already know E? and DETER? E at position 2 and 4? 
But it's a word? 

Perhaps THREW is better? 

I think THREW is a good choice? 

But what about vowel? we tested many? only E? and secret might have O? or U? 

In RAISE? we had vowels A? I? E? but only E is present? so the word contains E? and possibly no other vowels? or with consonants? 

For example? ""THREW"" has E? so it tests E? 

So? I'll use THREW? 

But note: THREW has no O? which is a vowel? we don't know if O is present? 

But we want to test common consonants? 

Another word? ""PROBE"": has O? not A? I? S? P R O B E? 
Letters: P?R?O?B?E? 
And E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5 because feedback already showed E is not at position 5? 
Thus? ""PROBE"" would have E at position 5? which is not allowed? so it's a bad guess? 

Therefore? avoid ending in E? 

So ""CRONE"" is bad? etc? 

So THREW? we can do? 

THREW:
Guessing THREW? 

<guess>THREW</guess> 

But let me finalize? 

I think it's fine? 

Let me go with ""THREW"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R and E are present in the secret word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- A, I, and S are absent from the word.

The new guess must:
- Exclude A, I, and S.
- Include R (any position except 1) and E (any position except 5).
- Test new common consonants to gather more information.

Reasoning step by step:
1. **Avoid forbidden positions**: Since R cannot be in position 1 and E cannot be in position 5, the guess must place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
2. **Introduce new letters**: Choose high-frequency consonants like T, H, W, N, L, or D to maximize information gain. Vowels are limited (only O, U, or Y are possible besides E, as A and I are ruled out).
3. **Word selection**: ""THREW"" is suitable because:
   - It includes E (position 4) and R (position 3), avoiding the forbidden positions.
   - It introduces T, H, W—new letters for further testing.
   - It contains no A, I, or S.
   - It's a valid English word and helps position R and E in new slots.

This guess will help confirm positions for R and E while testing three new letters.",Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,JOKER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There's no prior feedback to go on, so we want to pick a word that can provide a lot of information.
 Common strategies for the first word include using words with common letters and letters that are distinct to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback.
 For example, words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are often chosen because they contain common vowels and consonants.
 However, note that the game uses English 5-letter words.

 Let me think of a word that has letters that frequently appear in English words.
 Some popular starting words: ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"". 

 I'll choose ""RAISE"": 
   - It has two vowels (A, I, E) and three consonants (R, S) which are common.
   - It has distinct letters so we get information about five different letters.

 Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISEI'm starting with ""RAISE"" as my first guess. It's a strong opening word because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance of getting feedback about frequent letters. Since there's no prior information, this helps test multiple key letters at once.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We previously guessed RAISE and got feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- R is in the word but not in the first position.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the last position? Note: In RAISE, E is the fifth letter, so the feedback E(-) means E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Important deductions:
1. The letters A, I, S are ABSENT from the secret word. So we must avoid words containing A, I, or S.
2. R and E are present in the word, but:
   - R is not in position 1 (where we guessed it).
   - E is not in position 5 (where we guessed it).

We know the secret word contains R and E, but not A, I, S.

Since there are no other letters reported, the word must consist of letters other than A, I, S. But note: we might have missed letters that weren't in RAISE.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Excludes A, I, S.
- Includes R and E (since they are present).
- Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

Additionally, we want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also consider that perhaps the word has double letters? But since we got only two ""presents"" (R and E) and three absent (A,I,S), the word might have other letters we haven't tested.

We have 6 tries, so we need to cover more ground.

Idea: Use a word that has R and E in positions other than 1 and 5, and include three new common consonants.

But note: position matters. We know R can't be first, E can't be last.

Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5 (or possibly 1? no, because we got R(-) meaning it's misplaced, so not position 1). Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.

Also, since R and E are both in the word, we can try to put them in positions we haven't ruled out.

For example, if we put R in position 2, but we don't know if that's correct. We want to minimize conflicts.

Let's think of words without A,I,S, and containing R and E.

First, avoid A,I,S.

Consider vowels: we know the word does not contain A or I, so the vowels can only be E (which we have), O, U, and sometimes Y.

We already know E is in the word. What other vowels might be present? Let's try to include O and U to test.

Some words that come to mind:

Option: PRONE? But P is new and O is new. However, PRONE: 
- P, R, O, N, E
But E is in position 5? We can't put E in position 5 because our feedback said E is not in position 5. But PRONE puts E in position 5 -> that's invalid. We must avoid putting E at the end.

Option: RENEW? But has E twice? Also, S? No, avoid S. RENEW has double E? But not in the database necessarily.

List of words with R and E, excluding A,I,S:

We can try words like:
- BERGY: but not a common word? 
- Other words: CLEAR? But CLEAR has A -> invalid because A is ruled out.

Let me think: 
- ""OLDER"": O,L,D,E,R -> letters: O,L,D,E,R -> contains R and E, and E not at end? O L D E R -> E is at position 4? Position indices: 1:O, 2:L, 3:D, 4:E, 5:R -> E is at 4 and R at 5. But we don't know about R position? We know R cannot be at position 1, but position 5 is okay? Similarly, E cannot be at position 5? Our feedback E(-) meant it was present but not in position 5. So in this case, position 4 is okay for E? Yes, and R at 5? We haven't ruled out R at 5? The feedback R(-) said R is not at position 1? So position 5 may be possible? Also, we haven't tested R at 5.

But note: in OLDER, E is at 4 and R at 5. Since E is not at 5, that's okay. R at 5: we don't have information against that.

Alternatively, ""RECUT"": R,E,C,U,T -> R at 1? Can we put R at first? Our feedback said R is not in position 1? Since RAISE had R at first and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not position 1. Therefore, we cannot put R at position 1 again.

So in RECUT, if we put it as first guess with R at 1, it would violate? So avoid words starting with R.

Similarly, E cannot be at position 5. So our guess must not start with R and not end with E.

So back to OLDER: 
- It ends with R? Position 5: R is the fifth letter? We can do that? Because R not at position 1 is allowed at position 5?

But note: O L D E R -> positions:
1: O (new)
2: L (new)
3: D (new)
4: E (which we know is present, but we are putting at 4 -> not 5, so okay)
5: R (which we know is present? But we don't know about position 5? We only know R is not at position 1? Position 5 could be okay? But we haven't guessed R at 5 yet? So it might be correct or not? We'll get feedback.)

Also, all letters are new except R and E? We are introducing O, L, D, and R and E? Actually we are retesting E? But that's fine.

But the word must have exactly the letters including R and E? And others? OLDER seems a valid word? It means someone who is old.

But let me confirm: OLDER is an English word, yes.

Other options: 
- ""BERET"": has E twice? But that's okay? But BERET: B E R E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:E, 5:T -> E at position 2 and 4? So we can test E? But the feedback already told us E is in the word? And E(-) means not at position 5? We put E at positions 2 and 4? Which is fine? But BERET has double E? That could be possible.

But BERET contains E multiple times? And the secret word might have two E? Or one? We don't know? Our feedback from RAISE had only one E reported? But that could be because there is one E? Or if there are two Es, and one was in a wrong position? In RAISE, E was at position 5? But we got E(-) meaning E is present? But if the secret word had E elsewhere? But the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple letters? Wait, normally in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess it once and it's correct? Actually, let me recall the rules? Our rules are: 
- ✓: correct letter and position
- -: letter in the word but wrong position
- x: letter not in word

Also, if you guess a letter not repeated, and it appears once in the secret? But if you guess a letter that appears twice? You get feedback accordingly? But in this case, RAISE has only one E? And we got E(-)? So the secret word has E? But if it has two Es? We don't know? Because we only guessed one? Similarly, if the secret word has only one E, that's fine.

So multiple occurrences are possible? But we don't know? We can't assume? So BERET might be a valid word? But it contains E twice? But that's okay? It's a word! Also, we avoid A,I,S? BERET excludes those? Yes.

However, BERET: 
- We put E at position 2? Could E be at position 2? We don't know? And E at position 4? Similarly, R at position 3? We don't know.

But also note: in BERET, position 3: R? Could be? Because R is not at position 1? Position 3 is allowed? 

But let me compare OLDER and BERET? We want to maximize information? OLDER: O,L,D,E,R -> five new letters? Actually E and R are repeats? But we also introduce O,L,D? That's three new consonants? 

Similarly, BERET has B, E, R, E, T? So letters: B,E,R,T? With E repeated? So effectively testing B, E, R, T? and E? So not as efficient? Because we use a letter slot for E again? 

Alternatively, how about ""ENTER""? But that has E at position 1 and 4? And N,T? And R at 5? But E at position 1? That could be? Because we don't have information against E at position 1? Our feedback was only that E is not at position 5? Position 1 is open? But ENTER ends with R? position 5? But let's see: E at 1: not tested before? However, we also have R at 5? 

But ENTER? The word? Yes? 

But perhaps better is to avoid putting E at position 1 until we know? Because we have E? Already? And R? 

I think OLDER is a good candidate? Because:
- It doesn't start with R? Correct? OLDER starts with O?
- It has E at position 4? Not 5? 
- It has R at position 5? Which we haven't tried? 
- We introduce O, L, D? Which are common? 

So OLDER: O (position 1? new), L (2? new), D (3? new), E (4? we know E is present now at 4? must not be 5?), R (5? known letter? but new position?).

But we have confirmed E is in the word? So putting E at position 4? If it is correct? We get ✓? Or if it should be elsewhere? We get -? 

Similarly? R at 5? could be correct? 

Now? another word? ""CORED"": C,O,R,E,D? But that has R at position 3? and E at position 4? And ends with D? So E not at 5? acceptable? 

But let me see? which one gives better coverage: OLDER or similar? 

I also think about words that have R not at position 1? E not at position 5? and include common letters? 

For example? ""PROTE"": not a word? How about ""TRIED"": but T? R? I? no? we cannot use I because we ruled out I? TRIED has I? invalid? 

Another: ""CRONE"": C,R,O,N,E? but E at position 5? which is forbidden? Cannot guess? so if we guess CRONE? with E at 5? the feedback would immediately flag as wrong because E cannot be there? 

Similarly? words ending with E are bad? 

So? let's choose OLDER? 

What about ""RODEO"": but that has A? O? and sometimes Y? not? RODEO: R,O,D,E,O -> has O twice? and E at position 4? but we have R at position 1? we cannot put R at position 1? because our feedback said R not at 1? 

So R must be placed differently? 

Therefore? OLDER? Let's write it:

OLDER: 
Position 1: O? new 
Position 2: L? new 
Position 3: D? new 
Position 4: E? known? 
Position 5: R? known? 

But note: what if the secret word has R at position 5? But that might be? 

Alternatively? a word with R at position 2? E elsewhere? 

For example? ""TREAD"": but A is invalid? 

""URBED"": not common? 

""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T? E at position 3? and ends with T? so E not at 5? acceptable? but R is at position 2? Position indices: 1:C,2:R,3:E,4:P,5:T? 
Can we put R at position 2? Yes? because we only ruled out position 1? 

But CREPT? is that a word? Crept is the past tense of creep? yes? 

Similarly? CREPT: letters are C,R,E,P,T? all valid? no S,A,I? 

And we introduce C,R,E,P,T? but R and E are already known? So new letters: C,P,T? 
Compared to OLDER? OLDER introduces O,L,D? 

Both introduce three new letters? 

But CREPT has E at position 3? which may be less common? or more? 

I think OLDER is fine? but CREPT also? 

Another option: ""OPTER"": not common? 

""BLUER"": but has U? and ends with R? but B,L,U,E,R? U test? 

But perhaps we should avoid vowels? we already know about E? and A,I are out? so O and U are possible? 

I think both OLDER and CREPT are acceptable? 

I'll go with CREPT? wait? let's compare:

OLDER: if we guess OLDER and secret word has E elsewhere? then E at 4 would show -? and R at 5? similarly? 

But we want to test new letters? 

Another word? ""THREW"": T,H,R,E,W? has E at position 4? and R at position 3? 

THREW? T(1),H(2),R(3),E(4),W(5)? So E not at 5? okay? and R not at 1? okay? 

And letters: T,H,R,E,W? introduce T? H? W? plus R and E? 

That's three new letters? 

Similarly? 

But perhaps THREW is common? 

After consideration? I choose CREPT? because C,P,T? are common? and CREPT is a word? 

But CREPT: 
C(1)? new 
R(2)? known? but at new position? 
E(3)? known? at new position? 
P(4)? new 
T(5)? new 

This also? not at forbidden positions? 

Now? since E in RAISE was at position 5? and we said E is present? so it's likely in another position? we have many possibilities? 

I will go with CREPT. I think it covers with R at position 2? E at position 3? which weren't tested? 

So let's decide: CREPT? 

But RE is consecutive? might be less likely? but we don't know? 

Alternatively? another word? like ""CORBY"": not common? 

""GONER"": has E? ends with R? E is at position 4? O,K? but G O N E R? 
Position: 1:G?2:O?3:N?4:E?5:R -> E not at 5? acceptable? 
And letters: G?O?N?E?R? introduce G?O?N? 
But we have E at same position? 

The point is: both are valid? 

But after more thought: it might be better to cover more common? 
So OLDER? CREPT? THREW? BERET? 

I think CREPT or THREW? 

Let me pick THREW? 

Wait? no? because I don't know? 

Alternatively? let's choose a word containing R and E and other letters? I'll go with ""THREW""?

But THREW: T H R E W? 
T at 1? H at 2? R at 3? E at 4? W at 5? 
We introduce T,H,W? and R and E? 
E not at 5? good.

Similarly? we can consider ""DETER"": but has E twice? D? E? T? E? R? 
Letters: D?E?T?E?R? so D,T,R,E? 
But we already know E? and DETER? E at position 2 and 4? 
But it's a word? 

Perhaps THREW is better? 

I think THREW is a good choice? 

But what about vowel? we tested many? only E? and secret might have O? or U? 

In RAISE? we had vowels A? I? E? but only E is present? so the word contains E? and possibly no other vowels? or with consonants? 

For example? ""THREW"" has E? so it tests E? 

So? I'll use THREW? 

But note: THREW has no O? which is a vowel? we don't know if O is present? 

But we want to test common consonants? 

Another word? ""PROBE"": has O? not A? I? S? P R O B E? 
Letters: P?R?O?B?E? 
And E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5 because feedback already showed E is not at position 5? 
Thus? ""PROBE"" would have E at position 5? which is not allowed? so it's a bad guess? 

Therefore? avoid ending in E? 

So ""CRONE"" is bad? etc? 

So THREW? we can do? 

THREW:
Guessing THREW? 

<guess>THREW</guess> 

But let me finalize? 

I think it's fine? 

Let me go with ""THREW"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R and E are present in the secret word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- A, I, and S are absent from the word.

The new guess must:
- Exclude A, I, and S.
- Include R (any position except 1) and E (any position except 5).
- Test new common consonants to gather more information.

Reasoning step by step:
1. **Avoid forbidden positions**: Since R cannot be in position 1 and E cannot be in position 5, the guess must place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
2. **Introduce new letters**: Choose high-frequency consonants like T, H, W, N, L, or D to maximize information gain. Vowels are limited (only O, U, or Y are possible besides E, as A and I are ruled out).
3. **Word selection**: ""THREW"" is suitable because:
   - It includes E (position 4) and R (position 3), avoiding the forbidden positions.
   - It introduces T, H, W—new letters for further testing.
   - It contains no A, I, or S.
   - It's a valid English word and helps position R and E in new slots.

This guess will help confirm positions for R and E while testing three new letters.

Note: In RAISE, E is the fifth letter, so the feedback E(-) means E is in the word but not in the fifth position.\n\nImportant deductions:\n1. The letters A, I, S are ABSENT from the secret word. So we must avoid words containing A, I, or S.\n2. R and E are present in the word, but:\n   - R is not in position 1 (where we guessed it).\n   - E is not in position 5 (where we guessed it).\n\nWe know the secret word contains R and E, but not A, I, S.\n\nSince there are no other letters reported, the word must consist of letters other than A, I, S. But note: we might have missed letters that weren\'t in RAISE.\n\nWe need to form a new guess that:\n- Excludes A, I, S.\n- Includes R and E (since they are present).\n- Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.\n\nAdditionally, we want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe also consider that perhaps the word has double letters? But since we got only two ""presents"" (R and E) and three absent (A,I,S), the word might have other letters we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we need to cover more ground.\n\nIdea: Use a word that has R and E in positions other than 1 and 5, and include three new common consonants.\n\nBut note: position matters. We know R can\'t be first, E can\'t be last.\n\nPossible positions for R: 2,3,4,5 (or possibly 1? no, because we got R(-) meaning it\'s misplaced, so not position 1). Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.\n\nAlso, since R and E are both in the word, we can try to put them in positions we haven\'t ruled out.\n\nFor example, if we put R in position 2, but we don\'t know if that\'s correct. We want to minimize conflicts.\n\nLet\'s think of words without A,I,S, and containing R and E.\n\nFirst, avoid A,I,S.\n\nConsider vowels: we know the word does not contain A or I, so the vowels can only be E (which we have), O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nWe already know E is in the word. What other vowels might be present? Let\'s try to include O and U to test.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n\nOption: PRONE? But P is new and O is new. However, PRONE: \n- P, R, O, N, E\nBut E is in position 5? We can\'t put E in position 5 because our feedback said E is not in position 5. But PRONE puts E in position 5 -> that\'s invalid. We must avoid putting E at the end.\n\nOption: RENEW? But has E twice? Also, S? No, avoid S. RENEW has double E? But not in the database necessarily.\n\nList of words with R and E, excluding A,I,S:\n\nWe can try words like:\n- BERGY: but not a common word? \n- Other words: CLEAR? But CLEAR has A -> invalid because A is ruled out.\n\nLet me think: \n- ""OLDER"": O,L,D,E,R -> letters: O,L,D,E,R -> contains R and E, and E not at end? O L D E R -> E is at position 4? Position indices: 1:O, 2:L, 3:D, 4:E, 5:R -> E is at 4 and R at 5. But we don\'t know about R position? We know R cannot be at position 1, but position 5 is okay? Similarly, E cannot be at position 5? Our feedback E(-) meant it was present but not in position 5. So in this case, position 4 is okay for E? Yes, and R at 5? We haven\'t ruled out R at 5? The feedback R(-) said R is not at position 1? So position 5 may be possible? Also, we haven\'t tested R at 5.\n\nBut note: in OLDER, E is at 4 and R at 5. Since E is not at 5, that\'s okay. R at 5: we don\'t have information against that.\n\nAlternatively, ""RECUT"": R,E,C,U,T -> R at 1? Can we put R at first? Our feedback said R is not in position 1? Since RAISE had R at first and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not position 1. Therefore, we cannot put R at position 1 again.\n\nSo in RECUT, if we put it as first guess with R at 1, it would violate? So avoid words starting with R.\n\nSimilarly, E cannot be at position 5. So our guess must not start with R and not end with E.\n\nSo back to OLDER: \n- It ends with R? Position 5: R is the fifth letter? We can do that? Because R not at position 1 is allowed at position 5?\n\nBut note: O L D E R -> positions:\n1: O (new)\n2: L (new)\n3: D (new)\n4: E (which we know is present, but we are putting at 4 -> not 5, so okay)\n5: R (which we know is present? But we don\'t know about position 5? We only know R is not at position 1? Position 5 could be okay? But we haven\'t guessed R at 5 yet? So it might be correct or not? We\'ll get feedback.)\n\nAlso, all letters are new except R and E? We are introducing O, L, D, and R and E? Actually we are retesting E? But that\'s fine.\n\nBut the word must have exactly the letters including R and E? And others? OLDER seems a valid word? It means someone who is old.\n\nBut let me confirm: OLDER is an English word, yes.\n\nOther options: \n- ""BERET"": has E twice? But that\'s okay? But BERET: B E R E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:E, 5:T -> E at position 2 and 4? So we can test E? But the feedback already told us E is in the word? And E(-) means not at position 5? We put E at positions 2 and 4? Which is fine? But BERET has double E? That could be possible.\n\nBut BERET contains E multiple times? And the secret word might have two E? Or one? We don\'t know? Our feedback from RAISE had only one E reported? But that could be because there is one E? Or if there are two Es, and one was in a wrong position? In RAISE, E was at position 5? But we got E(-) meaning E is present? But if the secret word had E elsewhere? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple letters? Wait, normally in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess it once and it\'s correct? Actually, let me recall the rules? Our rules are: \n- ✓: correct letter and position\n- -: letter in the word but wrong position\n- x: letter not in word\n\nAlso, if you guess a letter not repeated, and it appears once in the secret? But if you guess a letter that appears twice? You get feedback accordingly? But in this case, RAISE has only one E? And we got E(-)? So the secret word has E? But if it has two Es? We don\'t know? Because we only guessed one? Similarly, if the secret word has only one E, that\'s fine.\n\nSo multiple occurrences are possible? But we don\'t know? We can\'t assume? So BERET might be a valid word? But it contains E twice? But that\'s okay? It\'s a word! Also, we avoid A,I,S? BERET excludes those? Yes.\n\nHowever, BERET: \n- We put E at position 2? Could E be at position 2? We don\'t know? And E at position 4? Similarly, R at position 3? We don\'t know.\n\nBut also note: in BERET, position 3: R? Could be? Because R is not at position 1? Position 3 is allowed? \n\nBut let me compare OLDER and BERET? We want to maximize information? OLDER: O,L,D,E,R -> five new letters? Actually E and R are repeats? But we also introduce O,L,D? That\'s three new consonants? \n\nSimilarly, BERET has B, E, R, E, T? So letters: B,E,R,T? With E repeated? So effectively testing B, E, R, T? and E? So not as efficient? Because we use a letter slot for E again? \n\nAlternatively, how about ""ENTER""? But that has E at position 1 and 4? And N,T? And R at 5? But E at position 1? That could be? Because we don\'t have information against E at position 1? Our feedback was only that E is not at position 5? Position 1 is open? But ENTER ends with R? position 5? But let\'s see: E at 1: not tested before? However, we also have R at 5? \n\nBut ENTER? The word? Yes? \n\nBut perhaps better is to avoid putting E at position 1 until we know? Because we have E? Already? And R? \n\nI think OLDER is a good candidate? Because:\n- It doesn\'t start with R? Correct? OLDER starts with O?\n- It has E at position 4? Not 5? \n- It has R at position 5? Which we haven\'t tried? \n- We introduce O, L, D? Which are common? \n\nSo OLDER: O (position 1? new), L (2? new), D (3? new), E (4? we know E is present now at 4? must not be 5?), R (5? known letter? but new position?).\n\nBut we have confirmed E is in the word? So putting E at position 4? If it is correct? We get ✓? Or if it should be elsewhere? We get -? \n\nSimilarly? R at 5? could be correct? \n\nNow? another word? ""CORED"": C,O,R,E,D? But that has R at position 3? and E at position 4? And ends with D? So E not at 5? acceptable? \n\nBut let me see? which one gives better coverage: OLDER or similar? \n\nI also think about words that have R not at position 1? E not at position 5? and include common letters? \n\nFor example? ""PROTE"": not a word? How about ""TRIED"": but T? R? I? no? we cannot use I because we ruled out I? TRIED has I? invalid? \n\nAnother: ""CRONE"": C,R,O,N,E? but E at position 5? which is forbidden? Cannot guess? so if we guess CRONE? with E at 5? the feedback would immediately flag as wrong because E cannot be there? \n\nSimilarly? words ending with E are bad? \n\nSo? let\'s choose OLDER? \n\nWhat about ""RODEO"": but that has A? O? and sometimes Y? not? RODEO: R,O,D,E,O -> has O twice? and E at position 4? but we have R at position 1? we cannot put R at position 1? because our feedback said R not at 1? \n\nSo R must be placed differently? \n\nTherefore? OLDER? Let\'s write it:\n\nOLDER: \nPosition 1: O? new \nPosition 2: L? new \nPosition 3: D? new \nPosition 4: E? known? \nPosition 5: R? known? \n\nBut note: what if the secret word has R at position 5? But that might be? \n\nAlternatively? a word with R at position 2? E elsewhere? \n\nFor example? ""TREAD"": but A is invalid? \n\n""URBED"": not common? \n\n""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T? E at position 3? and ends with T? so E not at 5? acceptable? but R is at position 2? Position indices: 1:C,2:R,3:E,4:P,5:T? \nCan we put R at position 2? Yes? because we only ruled out position 1? \n\nBut CREPT? is that a word? Crept is the past tense of creep? yes? \n\nSimilarly? CREPT: letters are C,R,E,P,T? all valid? no S,A,I? \n\nAnd we introduce C,R,E,P,T? but R and E are already known? So new letters: C,P,T? \nCompared to OLDER? OLDER introduces O,L,D? \n\nBoth introduce three new letters? \n\nBut CREPT has E at position 3? which may be less common? or more? \n\nI think OLDER is fine? but CREPT also? \n\nAnother option: ""OPTER"": not common? \n\n""BLUER"": but has U? and ends with R? but B,L,U,E,R? U test? \n\nBut perhaps we should avoid vowels? we already know about E? and A,I are out? so O and U are possible? \n\nI think both OLDER and CREPT are acceptable? \n\nI\'ll go with CREPT? wait? let\'s compare:\n\nOLDER: if we guess OLDER and secret word has E elsewhere? then E at 4 would show -? and R at 5? similarly? \n\nBut we want to test new letters? \n\nAnother word? ""THREW"": T,H,R,E,W? has E at position 4? and R at position 3? \n\nTHREW? T(1),H(2),R(3),E(4),W(5)? So E not at 5? okay? and R not at 1? okay? \n\nAnd letters: T,H,R,E,W? introduce T? H? W? plus R and E? \n\nThat\'s three new letters? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nBut perhaps THREW is common? \n\nAfter consideration? I choose CREPT? because C,P,T? are common? and CREPT is a word? \n\nBut CREPT: \nC(1)? new \nR(2)? known? but at new position? \nE(3)? known? at new position? \nP(4)? new \nT(5)? new \n\nThis also? not at forbidden positions? \n\nNow? since E in RAISE was at position 5? and we said E is present? so it\'s likely in another position? we have many possibilities? \n\nI will go with CREPT. I think it covers with R at position 2? E at position 3? which weren\'t tested? \n\nSo let\'s decide: CREPT? \n\nBut RE is consecutive? might be less likely? but we don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively? another word? like ""CORBY"": not common? \n\n""GONER"": has E? ends with R? E is at position 4? O,K? but G O N E R? \nPosition: 1:G?2:O?3:N?4:E?5:R -> E not at 5? acceptable? \nAnd letters: G?O?N?E?R? introduce G?O?N? \nBut we have E at same position? \n\nThe point is: both are valid? \n\nBut after more thought: it might be better to cover more common? \nSo OLDER? CREPT? THREW? BERET? \n\nI think CREPT or THREW? \n\nLet me pick THREW? \n\nWait? no? because I don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively? let\'s choose a word containing R and E and other letters?

We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

**Guess 2: THREW**
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- H(x): H is not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed R in position 3).
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position. Position 4? Let's note: THREW positions are:
  - Pos1: T (x)
  - Pos2: H (x)
  - Pos3: R (-)
  - Pos4: E (✓)
  - Pos5: W (x)
So E is at position 4 and it is correct. Therefore, the secret word must have E in position 4.

Also, from THREW:
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we put R at position 3 and it got (-), meaning it is elsewhere).
- We now know that E is fixed at position 4.

**Consolidated Information:**
1. **Fixed so far:**
   - Position 4: Must be E.

2. **Present letters:**
   - R: must be in the word but not at position 1 (from RAISE) and not at position 3 (from THREW). So possible positions for R: 2 or 5.
   - E: confirmed at position 4.

3. **Absent letters:**
   - A, I, S, T, H, W.
   - From RAISE: A, I, S are absent.
   - From THREW: T, H, W are absent.

4. **Unknown letters:**
   - The secret word has 5 letters. We know position 4 is E, and R is present (somewhere else). So the other three letters are unknown but must not be the absent ones.
   - We have tested: R,A,I,S,E,T,H,W. So missing letters include B,C,D,F,G,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,Y, etc.

5. **Requirements for new guess:**
   - Must have E at position 4.
   - Must not contain any of the absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W.
   - Must include R if we haven't yet found its position? But we know R is present? Or is R already placed? No, we know R is present but not placed? Actually, from previous guesses, R must be in the word? And E is fixed at 4? Position 4 is occupied by E? So R must be in positions 2 or 5? We need to determine where R is? And also the remaining letters? And also we have no information about the other positions? 

But note: the secret word has E at position 4? and R present? and the rest? So positions 1,2,3,5 must be filled with letters that are not absent? But we don't know what they are? We have only negative information? 

The new guess must include E at position 4? and R must be in the word? in 2 or 5? but we don't know? So we need to put R at position 2 or 5 to test? And we need to fill the other positions with new letters? to test? 

Since we have limited guesses? we can try to include possible positions for R and test common other letters? 

Also? note: the secret word has exactly 5 letters? with E at position 4? R somewhere? and the other letters? 

But we know that R cannot be at position 1 or 3? so positions 2 or 5? 

So? for the new guess? we must have E at position 4? and we can place R at either 2 or 5? to see? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

Let me propose words? 

Constraints: 
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- The word cannot have A, I, S, T, H, W.
- Must include R (since it's present? unless? but feedback says R is present? so yes? if we omit R? it won't satisfy? So yes? must include R) in a position other than 1 and 3? but in the guess? we can put R at 2 or 5? 

So possible words: 

List of 5-letter words with E at position 4? and that have R? and without A,I,S,T,H,W? 

Structure: 
Pos1: ? 
Pos2: ? or R? 
Pos3: ? 
Pos4: E 
Pos5: ? or R? (if R is not at Pos2? then at Pos5? or if we put R at Pos2? we can test that)

Let me think of words:

Option 1: Put R at position 2? 
Format: letter at1? R? letter at3? E? letter at5? 
For example: C R ? E ? 

Words: 
- ""CRUEL"": but has U? E? L? 
  - But position5: L?
  - But is L okay? We haven't tested L? and CRUEL: C,R,U,E,L -> 
  - Valid? E at4? 
  - But U and L are new? 
  - However, does it contain absent letters? A,I,S,T,H,W? no? T,H,W are absent? T is in absent? but CRUEL has no T,H,W? So okay? 

But wait? CRUEL? position3 is U? position5 is L? 

But we also need to verify if it contains R? at position2? yes? 

Now? what if R is not at position2? What if R is at position5? Then CRUEL would put R at2? which might be wrong? 

We could instead put R at position5? to test? 

Another word: with R at position5? Format: ? ? ? E R? 
For example: ""FLEER"": but has F? L? E? E? R? 
But FL E E R? positions: 
1:F? 2:L? 3:E? 4:E? but position4 must be E? but in FLEER? position4 would be E? and position5:R? 
But note: FLEER? isn't a common word? 
Also? we tested E? and we have E at position3? which we don't know? 

Actually? FLEER? is a word? but let's look for common words? 

Better: ""QUEER"": Q?U?E?E?R? but Q and U at positions 1 and 2? and E at position3? which we don't care? E at position4? and R at5? 

Also? QUEER has E twice? 
But? we don't know about duplicate? 

Similarly? ""PLIER"": but has I? ruled out? 

""AUDIO"": ruled out? 

So? words with R at5: 
Examples: ""POWER"": but has W? W is absent? 
""BEVER"": not a word? 
""DEMUR"": D?E?M?U?R -> positions: D at1? E at2? but position4 must be E? so not? 

Format for R at5: we need position4 to be E? and position5 to be R? So words ending with ""ER"": 
Pattern: ? ? ? E R? 

Common words: 
- ""CIDER"": C,I,D? I is absent? invalid? 
- ""DINER"": has I? invalid? 
- ""FIGHTER"": too long? 
- ""LIKER"": has I? 
- ""MOWER"": has W? 
- ""NUDER"": not common? 
- ""RACER"": has A? invalid? 
- ""RAMEN"": not 5? 
- ""REPER"": not word? 
- ""RIPER"": has I? 
- ""ROGER"": O? G? E? R? but positions: R at1? O at2? G at3? E at4? R at5? 
But in ROGER? position1: R? but we cannot put R at position1? because we know R is not at position1? from RAISE? 
So ROGER is invalid? because it has R at1? 

Similarly? words starting with R are invalid? 

So words ending with ER? without absent letters? avoiding A,I,S,T,H,W? and not starting with R? 

For example: ""BEEFY"": not ends with ER? 
""CYBER"": but positions: 
If C Y B E R? positions: E at4? R at5? 
And C?Y?B? are new? 
And CYBER? word? 

CYBER: 
- C(1)? new
- Y(2)? new? and vowel or consonant? 
- B(3)? new
- E(4)? fixed
- R(5)? which we want to test? possible R at position5? 

Also? no absent letters? 

But note? the secret word? must have E at position4? and R? which CYBER places R at5? 

Alternatively? ""GONER"": G? O? N? E? R? 
Positions: G(1)? O(2)? N(3)? E(4)? R(5)? 
Similarly? not absent?

And I? S? etc? no? 

Similarly? ""HOMER"": H is absent? from THREW? H(x)? so cannot have H? 

Therefore? CYBER? GONER? etc? 

But why not? 

Also? CYBER? GONER introduce new letters? 

Let's go back: I need to guess a word that:

- Position 4: E
- Must include R? at position 2 or 5? 
- And other letters not in absent set? 

But also? we can put R at multiple positions? or just one? Since the secret has R exactly once? or possibly twice? but we don't know? Each guess is interpreted individually? 

In CYBER? R is only at position5? 

Similarly? for position2? Like CRUEL? 

Now? the choice: should I put R at position2 or position5? 

Since we know R cannot be at position1 or 3? it must be at position2 or position5? 

So if I put R at position2 in this guess? and it's correct? we get ✓? If not? then R must be at position5? because those are the only options? 

Similarly? if I put R at position5 and it's wrong? then we must put R at position2? 

So we can decide? 

But also? we can cover both? but with one guess? 

For example? if we put R at position2? and also test new letters? 

Or? we can put R at position5? 

But I want to maximize information about other letters? 

Perhaps? put R at position2? and include common new letters? 

So guess: ? R ? E ? 

Where positions 1,3,5 are new letters? 

Similarly? avoid absent letters? 

Or if we put R at position5? pattern: ? ? ? E R? 

But then positions 1,2,3 need to be filled? 

But note? in the second pattern? position3 is tested? 

From THREW? position3: R? got (-)? meaning the correct R is not at position3? but that doesn't tell us what letter is actually at position3? 

So we need to guess letters for positions 1,2,3? 

The same for positions 1,2,5? 

But we have E fixed at4? so position3 must be a letter? 

Both scenarios are symmetric? 

So let me choose to put R at position2? Then we can test:

For positions 1,3,5 with new letters? and R at2? E at4? 

Examples: 
- ""CRUEL"": C at1? R at2? U at3? E at4? L at5? 
  Letters: C,R,U,E,L? All new except R and E? 
  Absent letters? None? So okay? 

Another: ""DRIED"": D? R? I? E? D? But contains I? absent? invalid? 

""FREED"": F? R? E? E? D? But E twice? and E at position3? but position3? and position4:E? 
But note? position3 and position4 are different? 
FREED: 
1: F? 
2: R? 
3: E? But wait? we put E at position3? Now? from feedback? we know E is at position4? but we don't know about E elsewhere? 
If the secret word has only one E? then putting E at position3 would be useless? if it's not present? 
But FREED has E at position3? That's okay? 
But also? D at position5? 
But note? the secret word has E at position4? and we don't know if there are other E? 
So it could be? 
Also? FREED? does it contain S?A?I? no? But T?H?W? no? so okay? 
But E at position3: if there is no E at position3? it would show x? because E is present? so we would know? 

But let's focus? 
I think CRUEL is a valid word? and introduces C?U?L? 

Similarly? ""GRUEL"": G?R?U?E?L? same as CRUEL? 
Also valid? 

But either? 

I can also use ""PROWL"": but no? position4 must be E? 

Not: ""BRULE"": perhaps not common? 

So perhaps CRUEL or GRUEL? 

But GRUEL is more common? meaning? 

Alternatively? ""QUEEN"": Q?U?E?E?N? but E at position4? but position3 also E? 
And no R? we must include R? because R is present? we cannot omit R? 
So QUEEN does not contain R? invalid? 

Another word: ""CREWL"": not a word? 

So? CRUEL? 

But CRUEL? L at position5? 

Now? similarly? we can put R at position5? with GONER? etc? 

But let's choose putting R at position2? because position5 we haven't tested? and position2 we might need to confirm? 

Another word: ""DETER"": D?E?T?E?R? but T is absent? so cannot? because THREW said T(x). 

""PETER"": P?E?T?E?R? T absent? 

""BEVER"": not word? 

So back to? 

I think ""CRUEL"" or ""GRUEL"" or ""PRUDE"": PRUDE? P?R?U?D?E? positions: 
1:P? 
2:R? 
3:U? 
4:E? 
5:D -> D? 
But E at position4? 
And no absent letters? 
PRUDE is a valid word? 

So ""PRUDE"": P at1? R at2? U at3? D at5? 

Also? introduces P?R?U?D?E? but R and E known? 

Similarly? letters P,U,D? new? 

PRUDE vs CRUEL? 

PRUDE doesn't have C or L? 

But equally good? 

I'll choose ""PRUDE"" as the guess? 

But wait? both are okay? 

Alternatively? think about the most common letters: 
The remaining common consonants: B?C?D?F?G?L?M?N?O?P?Q?U?V?Y? 

So CRUEL: C,U?L? 
PRUDE: P?U?D? 

Perhaps similar? 

But let me try PRUDE? 

Why not? 

So? new guess: PRUDE? with E at4? R at2? 

In the feedback? for R? since we put R at position2? we will get: 
- If R is correct at2? then ✓ for R? 
- If R is in the word but not at2? then it must be at position5? therefore we get - for R? meaning R is misplaced? 

Similarly? for E? we already know E at4 is correct? so it will be ✓? 

And we'll learn about P? U? D? 

Similarly with other words? 

But also? note? if PRUDE? position3: U? which might be? 

So? let me use PRUDE? 

But one more thought: the secret word might have U? but we don't know? 

Also? GONER? for putting R at5? 

But let's not overcomplicate? I think PRUDE is fine? 

So? guess: ""PRUDE""
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R is present but not pos 1, A/I/S absent, E present but not pos 5.
- **Guess 2 (THREW)**: T/H/W absent, R present but not pos 3, E is in the word and CORRECT at pos 4.

**Deductions:**
- E is fixed at position 4 in the secret word.
- R must be present but cannot be in positions 1 or 3, leaving only positions 2 or 5 possible.
- Absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W.
- The new guess must:
  - Have E in position 4.
  - Include R (in position 2 or 5 to test its location).
  - Exclude absent letters (A/I/S/T/H/W).
  - Test new common consonants for positions 1, 3, and 5.

**Word Choice Reasoning:**  
""PRUDE"" is selected because:
- Position 4: E (correct placement).
- Position 2: R (tests if R belongs here; feedback will indicate if correct or if R is in position 5).
- Positions 1, 3, 5: P, U, D (new high-frequency letters to probe).
- No absent letters and valid English word.

This guess efficiently narrows R's position (2 or 5) while testing three new letters.

<guess>PRUDE</guess>",PRUDE,"We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

**Guess 2: THREW**
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- H(x): H is not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed R in position 3).
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position. Position 4? Let's note: THREW positions are:
  - Pos1: T (x)
  - Pos2: H (x)
  - Pos3: R (-)
  - Pos4: E (✓)
  - Pos5: W (x)
So E is at position 4 and it is correct. Therefore, the secret word must have E in position 4.

Also, from THREW:
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we put R at position 3 and it got (-), meaning it is elsewhere).
- We now know that E is fixed at position 4.

**Consolidated Information:**
1. **Fixed so far:**
   - Position 4: Must be E.

2. **Present letters:**
   - R: must be in the word but not at position 1 (from RAISE) and not at position 3 (from THREW). So possible positions for R: 2 or 5.
   - E: confirmed at position 4.

3. **Absent letters:**
   - A, I, S, T, H, W.
   - From RAISE: A, I, S are absent.
   - From THREW: T, H, W are absent.

4. **Unknown letters:**
   - The secret word has 5 letters. We know position 4 is E, and R is present (somewhere else). So the other three letters are unknown but must not be the absent ones.
   - We have tested: R,A,I,S,E,T,H,W. So missing letters include B,C,D,F,G,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,Y, etc.

5. **Requirements for new guess:**
   - Must have E at position 4.
   - Must not contain any of the absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W.
   - Must include R if we haven't yet found its position? But we know R is present? Or is R already placed? No, we know R is present but not placed? Actually, from previous guesses, R must be in the word? And E is fixed at 4? Position 4 is occupied by E? So R must be in positions 2 or 5? We need to determine where R is? And also the remaining letters? And also we have no information about the other positions? 

But note: the secret word has E at position 4? and R present? and the rest? So positions 1,2,3,5 must be filled with letters that are not absent? But we don't know what they are? We have only negative information? 

The new guess must include E at position 4? and R must be in the word? in 2 or 5? but we don't know? So we need to put R at position 2 or 5 to test? And we need to fill the other positions with new letters? to test? 

Since we have limited guesses? we can try to include possible positions for R and test common other letters? 

Also? note: the secret word has exactly 5 letters? with E at position 4? R somewhere? and the other letters? 

But we know that R cannot be at position 1 or 3? so positions 2 or 5? 

So? for the new guess? we must have E at position 4? and we can place R at either 2 or 5? to see? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

Let me propose words? 

Constraints: 
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- The word cannot have A, I, S, T, H, W.
- Must include R (since it's present? unless? but feedback says R is present? so yes? if we omit R? it won't satisfy? So yes? must include R) in a position other than 1 and 3? but in the guess? we can put R at 2 or 5? 

So possible words: 

List of 5-letter words with E at position 4? and that have R? and without A,I,S,T,H,W? 

Structure: 
Pos1: ? 
Pos2: ? or R? 
Pos3: ? 
Pos4: E 
Pos5: ? or R? (if R is not at Pos2? then at Pos5? or if we put R at Pos2? we can test that)

Let me think of words:

Option 1: Put R at position 2? 
Format: letter at1? R? letter at3? E? letter at5? 
For example: C R ? E ? 

Words: 
- ""CRUEL"": but has U? E? L? 
  - But position5: L?
  - But is L okay? We haven't tested L? and CRUEL: C,R,U,E,L -> 
  - Valid? E at4? 
  - But U and L are new? 
  - However, does it contain absent letters? A,I,S,T,H,W? no? T,H,W are absent? T is in absent? but CRUEL has no T,H,W? So okay? 

But wait? CRUEL? position3 is U? position5 is L? 

But we also need to verify if it contains R? at position2? yes? 

Now? what if R is not at position2? What if R is at position5? Then CRUEL would put R at2? which might be wrong? 

We could instead put R at position5? to test? 

Another word: with R at position5? Format: ? ? ? E R? 
For example: ""FLEER"": but has F? L? E? E? R? 
But FL E E R? positions: 
1:F? 2:L? 3:E? 4:E? but position4 must be E? but in FLEER? position4 would be E? and position5:R? 
But note: FLEER? isn't a common word? 
Also? we tested E? and we have E at position3? which we don't know? 

Actually? FLEER? is a word? but let's look for common words? 

Better: ""QUEER"": Q?U?E?E?R? but Q and U at positions 1 and 2? and E at position3? which we don't care? E at position4? and R at5? 

Also? QUEER has E twice? 
But? we don't know about duplicate? 

Similarly? ""PLIER"": but has I? ruled out? 

""AUDIO"": ruled out? 

So? words with R at5: 
Examples: ""POWER"": but has W? W is absent? 
""BEVER"": not a word? 
""DEMUR"": D?E?M?U?R -> positions: D at1? E at2? but position4 must be E? so not? 

Format for R at5: we need position4 to be E? and position5 to be R? So words ending with ""ER"": 
Pattern: ? ? ? E R? 

Common words: 
- ""CIDER"": C,I,D? I is absent? invalid? 
- ""DINER"": has I? invalid? 
- ""FIGHTER"": too long? 
- ""LIKER"": has I? 
- ""MOWER"": has W? 
- ""NUDER"": not common? 
- ""RACER"": has A? invalid? 
- ""RAMEN"": not 5? 
- ""REPER"": not word? 
- ""RIPER"": has I? 
- ""ROGER"": O? G? E? R? but positions: R at1? O at2? G at3? E at4? R at5? 
But in ROGER? position1: R? but we cannot put R at position1? because we know R is not at position1? from RAISE? 
So ROGER is invalid? because it has R at1? 

Similarly? words starting with R are invalid? 

So words ending with ER? without absent letters? avoiding A,I,S,T,H,W? and not starting with R? 

For example: ""BEEFY"": not ends with ER? 
""CYBER"": but positions: 
If C Y B E R? positions: E at4? R at5? 
And C?Y?B? are new? 
And CYBER? word? 

CYBER: 
- C(1)? new
- Y(2)? new? and vowel or consonant? 
- B(3)? new
- E(4)? fixed
- R(5)? which we want to test? possible R at position5? 

Also? no absent letters? 

But note? the secret word? must have E at position4? and R? which CYBER places R at5? 

Alternatively? ""GONER"": G? O? N? E? R? 
Positions: G(1)? O(2)? N(3)? E(4)? R(5)? 
Similarly? not absent?

And I? S? etc? no? 

Similarly? ""HOMER"": H is absent? from THREW? H(x)? so cannot have H? 

Therefore? CYBER? GONER? etc? 

But why not? 

Also? CYBER? GONER introduce new letters? 

Let's go back: I need to guess a word that:

- Position 4: E
- Must include R? at position 2 or 5? 
- And other letters not in absent set? 

But also? we can put R at multiple positions? or just one? Since the secret has R exactly once? or possibly twice? but we don't know? Each guess is interpreted individually? 

In CYBER? R is only at position5? 

Similarly? for position2? Like CRUEL? 

Now? the choice: should I put R at position2 or position5? 

Since we know R cannot be at position1 or 3? it must be at position2 or position5? 

So if I put R at position2 in this guess? and it's correct? we get ✓? If not? then R must be at position5? because those are the only options? 

Similarly? if I put R at position5 and it's wrong? then we must put R at position2? 

So we can decide? 

But also? we can cover both? but with one guess? 

For example? if we put R at position2? and also test new letters? 

Or? we can put R at position5? 

But I want to maximize information about other letters? 

Perhaps? put R at position2? and include common new letters? 

So guess: ? R ? E ? 

Where positions 1,3,5 are new letters? 

Similarly? avoid absent letters? 

Or if we put R at position5? pattern: ? ? ? E R? 

But then positions 1,2,3 need to be filled? 

But note? in the second pattern? position3 is tested? 

From THREW? position3: R? got (-)? meaning the correct R is not at position3? but that doesn't tell us what letter is actually at position3? 

So we need to guess letters for positions 1,2,3? 

The same for positions 1,2,5? 

But we have E fixed at4? so position3 must be a letter? 

Both scenarios are symmetric? 

So let me choose to put R at position2? Then we can test:

For positions 1,3,5 with new letters? and R at2? E at4? 

Examples: 
- ""CRUEL"": C at1? R at2? U at3? E at4? L at5? 
  Letters: C,R,U,E,L? All new except R and E? 
  Absent letters? None? So okay? 

Another: ""DRIED"": D? R? I? E? D? But contains I? absent? invalid? 

""FREED"": F? R? E? E? D? But E twice? and E at position3? but position3? and position4:E? 
But note? position3 and position4 are different? 
FREED: 
1: F? 
2: R? 
3: E? But wait? we put E at position3? Now? from feedback? we know E is at position4? but we don't know about E elsewhere? 
If the secret word has only one E? then putting E at position3 would be useless? if it's not present? 
But FREED has E at position3? That's okay? 
But also? D at position5? 
But note? the secret word has E at position4? and we don't know if there are other E? 
So it could be? 
Also? FREED? does it contain S?A?I? no? But T?H?W? no? so okay? 
But E at position3: if there is no E at position3? it would show x? because E is present? so we would know? 

But let's focus? 
I think CRUEL is a valid word? and introduces C?U?L? 

Similarly? ""GRUEL"": G?R?U?E?L? same as CRUEL? 
Also valid? 

But either? 

I can also use ""PROWL"": but no? position4 must be E? 

Not: ""BRULE"": perhaps not common? 

So perhaps CRUEL or GRUEL? 

But GRUEL is more common? meaning? 

Alternatively? ""QUEEN"": Q?U?E?E?N? but E at position4? but position3 also E? 
And no R? we must include R? because R is present? we cannot omit R? 
So QUEEN does not contain R? invalid? 

Another word: ""CREWL"": not a word? 

So? CRUEL? 

But CRUEL? L at position5? 

Now? similarly? we can put R at position5? with GONER? etc? 

But let's choose putting R at position2? because position5 we haven't tested? and position2 we might need to confirm? 

Another word: ""DETER"": D?E?T?E?R? but T is absent? so cannot? because THREW said T(x). 

""PETER"": P?E?T?E?R? T absent? 

""BEVER"": not word? 

So back to? 

I think ""CRUEL"" or ""GRUEL"" or ""PRUDE"": PRUDE? P?R?U?D?E? positions: 
1:P? 
2:R? 
3:U? 
4:E? 
5:D -> D? 
But E at position4? 
And no absent letters? 
PRUDE is a valid word? 

So ""PRUDE"": P at1? R at2? U at3? D at5? 

Also? introduces P?R?U?D?E? but R and E known? 

Similarly? letters P,U,D? new? 

PRUDE vs CRUEL? 

PRUDE doesn't have C or L? 

But equally good? 

I'll choose ""PRUDE"" as the guess? 

But wait? both are okay? 

Alternatively? think about the most common letters: 
The remaining common consonants: B?C?D?F?G?L?M?N?O?P?Q?U?V?Y? 

So CRUEL: C,U?L? 
PRUDE: P?U?D? 

Perhaps similar? 

But let me try PRUDE? 

Why not? 

So? new guess: PRUDE? with E at4? R at2? 

In the feedback? for R? since we put R at position2? we will get: 
- If R is correct at2? then ✓ for R? 
- If R is in the word but not at2? then it must be at position5? therefore we get - for R? meaning R is misplaced? 

Similarly? for E? we already know E at4 is correct? so it will be ✓? 

And we'll learn about P? U? D? 

Similarly with other words? 

But also? note? if PRUDE? position3: U? which might be? 

So? let me use PRUDE? 

But one more thought: the secret word might have U? but we don't know? 

Also? GONER? for putting R at5? 

But let's not overcomplicate? I think PRUDE is fine? 

So? guess: ""PRUDE""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R is present but not pos 1, A/I/S absent, E present but not pos 5.
- **Guess 2 (THREW)**: T/H/W absent, R present but not pos 3, E is in the word and CORRECT at pos 4.

**Deductions:**
- E is fixed at position 4 in the secret word.
- R must be present but cannot be in positions 1 or 3, leaving only positions 2 or 5 possible.
- Absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W.
- The new guess must:
  - Have E in position 4.
  - Include R (in position 2 or 5 to test its location).
  - Exclude absent letters (A/I/S/T/H/W).
  - Test new common consonants for positions 1, 3, and 5.

**Word Choice Reasoning:**  
""PRUDE"" is selected because:
- Position 4: E (correct placement).
- Position 2: R (tests if R belongs here; feedback will indicate if correct or if R is in position 5).
- Positions 1, 3, 5: P, U, D (new high-frequency letters to probe).
- No absent letters and valid English word.

This guess efficiently narrows R's position (2 or 5) while testing three new letters.",Guess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,JOKER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There's no prior feedback to go on, so we want to pick a word that can provide a lot of information.
 Common strategies for the first word include using words with common letters and letters that are distinct to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback.
 For example, words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are often chosen because they contain common vowels and consonants.
 However, note that the game uses English 5-letter words.

 Let me think of a word that has letters that frequently appear in English words.
 Some popular starting words: ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"". 

 I'll choose ""RAISE"": 
   - It has two vowels (A, I, E) and three consonants (R, S) which are common.
   - It has distinct letters so we get information about five different letters.

 Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISEI'm starting with ""RAISE"" as my first guess. It's a strong opening word because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance of getting feedback about frequent letters. Since there's no prior information, this helps test multiple key letters at once.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We previously guessed RAISE and got feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- R is in the word but not in the first position.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the last position? Note: In RAISE, E is the fifth letter, so the feedback E(-) means E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Important deductions:
1. The letters A, I, S are ABSENT from the secret word. So we must avoid words containing A, I, or S.
2. R and E are present in the word, but:
   - R is not in position 1 (where we guessed it).
   - E is not in position 5 (where we guessed it).

We know the secret word contains R and E, but not A, I, S.

Since there are no other letters reported, the word must consist of letters other than A, I, S. But note: we might have missed letters that weren't in RAISE.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Excludes A, I, S.
- Includes R and E (since they are present).
- Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

Additionally, we want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also consider that perhaps the word has double letters? But since we got only two ""presents"" (R and E) and three absent (A,I,S), the word might have other letters we haven't tested.

We have 6 tries, so we need to cover more ground.

Idea: Use a word that has R and E in positions other than 1 and 5, and include three new common consonants.

But note: position matters. We know R can't be first, E can't be last.

Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5 (or possibly 1? no, because we got R(-) meaning it's misplaced, so not position 1). Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.

Also, since R and E are both in the word, we can try to put them in positions we haven't ruled out.

For example, if we put R in position 2, but we don't know if that's correct. We want to minimize conflicts.

Let's think of words without A,I,S, and containing R and E.

First, avoid A,I,S.

Consider vowels: we know the word does not contain A or I, so the vowels can only be E (which we have), O, U, and sometimes Y.

We already know E is in the word. What other vowels might be present? Let's try to include O and U to test.

Some words that come to mind:

Option: PRONE? But P is new and O is new. However, PRONE: 
- P, R, O, N, E
But E is in position 5? We can't put E in position 5 because our feedback said E is not in position 5. But PRONE puts E in position 5 -> that's invalid. We must avoid putting E at the end.

Option: RENEW? But has E twice? Also, S? No, avoid S. RENEW has double E? But not in the database necessarily.

List of words with R and E, excluding A,I,S:

We can try words like:
- BERGY: but not a common word? 
- Other words: CLEAR? But CLEAR has A -> invalid because A is ruled out.

Let me think: 
- ""OLDER"": O,L,D,E,R -> letters: O,L,D,E,R -> contains R and E, and E not at end? O L D E R -> E is at position 4? Position indices: 1:O, 2:L, 3:D, 4:E, 5:R -> E is at 4 and R at 5. But we don't know about R position? We know R cannot be at position 1, but position 5 is okay? Similarly, E cannot be at position 5? Our feedback E(-) meant it was present but not in position 5. So in this case, position 4 is okay for E? Yes, and R at 5? We haven't ruled out R at 5? The feedback R(-) said R is not at position 1? So position 5 may be possible? Also, we haven't tested R at 5.

But note: in OLDER, E is at 4 and R at 5. Since E is not at 5, that's okay. R at 5: we don't have information against that.

Alternatively, ""RECUT"": R,E,C,U,T -> R at 1? Can we put R at first? Our feedback said R is not in position 1? Since RAISE had R at first and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not position 1. Therefore, we cannot put R at position 1 again.

So in RECUT, if we put it as first guess with R at 1, it would violate? So avoid words starting with R.

Similarly, E cannot be at position 5. So our guess must not start with R and not end with E.

So back to OLDER: 
- It ends with R? Position 5: R is the fifth letter? We can do that? Because R not at position 1 is allowed at position 5?

But note: O L D E R -> positions:
1: O (new)
2: L (new)
3: D (new)
4: E (which we know is present, but we are putting at 4 -> not 5, so okay)
5: R (which we know is present? But we don't know about position 5? We only know R is not at position 1? Position 5 could be okay? But we haven't guessed R at 5 yet? So it might be correct or not? We'll get feedback.)

Also, all letters are new except R and E? We are introducing O, L, D, and R and E? Actually we are retesting E? But that's fine.

But the word must have exactly the letters including R and E? And others? OLDER seems a valid word? It means someone who is old.

But let me confirm: OLDER is an English word, yes.

Other options: 
- ""BERET"": has E twice? But that's okay? But BERET: B E R E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:E, 5:T -> E at position 2 and 4? So we can test E? But the feedback already told us E is in the word? And E(-) means not at position 5? We put E at positions 2 and 4? Which is fine? But BERET has double E? That could be possible.

But BERET contains E multiple times? And the secret word might have two E? Or one? We don't know? Our feedback from RAISE had only one E reported? But that could be because there is one E? Or if there are two Es, and one was in a wrong position? In RAISE, E was at position 5? But we got E(-) meaning E is present? But if the secret word had E elsewhere? But the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple letters? Wait, normally in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess it once and it's correct? Actually, let me recall the rules? Our rules are: 
- ✓: correct letter and position
- -: letter in the word but wrong position
- x: letter not in word

Also, if you guess a letter not repeated, and it appears once in the secret? But if you guess a letter that appears twice? You get feedback accordingly? But in this case, RAISE has only one E? And we got E(-)? So the secret word has E? But if it has two Es? We don't know? Because we only guessed one? Similarly, if the secret word has only one E, that's fine.

So multiple occurrences are possible? But we don't know? We can't assume? So BERET might be a valid word? But it contains E twice? But that's okay? It's a word! Also, we avoid A,I,S? BERET excludes those? Yes.

However, BERET: 
- We put E at position 2? Could E be at position 2? We don't know? And E at position 4? Similarly, R at position 3? We don't know.

But also note: in BERET, position 3: R? Could be? Because R is not at position 1? Position 3 is allowed? 

But let me compare OLDER and BERET? We want to maximize information? OLDER: O,L,D,E,R -> five new letters? Actually E and R are repeats? But we also introduce O,L,D? That's three new consonants? 

Similarly, BERET has B, E, R, E, T? So letters: B,E,R,T? With E repeated? So effectively testing B, E, R, T? and E? So not as efficient? Because we use a letter slot for E again? 

Alternatively, how about ""ENTER""? But that has E at position 1 and 4? And N,T? And R at 5? But E at position 1? That could be? Because we don't have information against E at position 1? Our feedback was only that E is not at position 5? Position 1 is open? But ENTER ends with R? position 5? But let's see: E at 1: not tested before? However, we also have R at 5? 

But ENTER? The word? Yes? 

But perhaps better is to avoid putting E at position 1 until we know? Because we have E? Already? And R? 

I think OLDER is a good candidate? Because:
- It doesn't start with R? Correct? OLDER starts with O?
- It has E at position 4? Not 5? 
- It has R at position 5? Which we haven't tried? 
- We introduce O, L, D? Which are common? 

So OLDER: O (position 1? new), L (2? new), D (3? new), E (4? we know E is present now at 4? must not be 5?), R (5? known letter? but new position?).

But we have confirmed E is in the word? So putting E at position 4? If it is correct? We get ✓? Or if it should be elsewhere? We get -? 

Similarly? R at 5? could be correct? 

Now? another word? ""CORED"": C,O,R,E,D? But that has R at position 3? and E at position 4? And ends with D? So E not at 5? acceptable? 

But let me see? which one gives better coverage: OLDER or similar? 

I also think about words that have R not at position 1? E not at position 5? and include common letters? 

For example? ""PROTE"": not a word? How about ""TRIED"": but T? R? I? no? we cannot use I because we ruled out I? TRIED has I? invalid? 

Another: ""CRONE"": C,R,O,N,E? but E at position 5? which is forbidden? Cannot guess? so if we guess CRONE? with E at 5? the feedback would immediately flag as wrong because E cannot be there? 

Similarly? words ending with E are bad? 

So? let's choose OLDER? 

What about ""RODEO"": but that has A? O? and sometimes Y? not? RODEO: R,O,D,E,O -> has O twice? and E at position 4? but we have R at position 1? we cannot put R at position 1? because our feedback said R not at 1? 

So R must be placed differently? 

Therefore? OLDER? Let's write it:

OLDER: 
Position 1: O? new 
Position 2: L? new 
Position 3: D? new 
Position 4: E? known? 
Position 5: R? known? 

But note: what if the secret word has R at position 5? But that might be? 

Alternatively? a word with R at position 2? E elsewhere? 

For example? ""TREAD"": but A is invalid? 

""URBED"": not common? 

""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T? E at position 3? and ends with T? so E not at 5? acceptable? but R is at position 2? Position indices: 1:C,2:R,3:E,4:P,5:T? 
Can we put R at position 2? Yes? because we only ruled out position 1? 

But CREPT? is that a word? Crept is the past tense of creep? yes? 

Similarly? CREPT: letters are C,R,E,P,T? all valid? no S,A,I? 

And we introduce C,R,E,P,T? but R and E are already known? So new letters: C,P,T? 
Compared to OLDER? OLDER introduces O,L,D? 

Both introduce three new letters? 

But CREPT has E at position 3? which may be less common? or more? 

I think OLDER is fine? but CREPT also? 

Another option: ""OPTER"": not common? 

""BLUER"": but has U? and ends with R? but B,L,U,E,R? U test? 

But perhaps we should avoid vowels? we already know about E? and A,I are out? so O and U are possible? 

I think both OLDER and CREPT are acceptable? 

I'll go with CREPT? wait? let's compare:

OLDER: if we guess OLDER and secret word has E elsewhere? then E at 4 would show -? and R at 5? similarly? 

But we want to test new letters? 

Another word? ""THREW"": T,H,R,E,W? has E at position 4? and R at position 3? 

THREW? T(1),H(2),R(3),E(4),W(5)? So E not at 5? okay? and R not at 1? okay? 

And letters: T,H,R,E,W? introduce T? H? W? plus R and E? 

That's three new letters? 

Similarly? 

But perhaps THREW is common? 

After consideration? I choose CREPT? because C,P,T? are common? and CREPT is a word? 

But CREPT: 
C(1)? new 
R(2)? known? but at new position? 
E(3)? known? at new position? 
P(4)? new 
T(5)? new 

This also? not at forbidden positions? 

Now? since E in RAISE was at position 5? and we said E is present? so it's likely in another position? we have many possibilities? 

I will go with CREPT. I think it covers with R at position 2? E at position 3? which weren't tested? 

So let's decide: CREPT? 

But RE is consecutive? might be less likely? but we don't know? 

Alternatively? another word? like ""CORBY"": not common? 

""GONER"": has E? ends with R? E is at position 4? O,K? but G O N E R? 
Position: 1:G?2:O?3:N?4:E?5:R -> E not at 5? acceptable? 
And letters: G?O?N?E?R? introduce G?O?N? 
But we have E at same position? 

The point is: both are valid? 

But after more thought: it might be better to cover more common? 
So OLDER? CREPT? THREW? BERET? 

I think CREPT or THREW? 

Let me pick THREW? 

Wait? no? because I don't know? 

Alternatively? let's choose a word containing R and E and other letters? I'll go with ""THREW""?

But THREW: T H R E W? 
T at 1? H at 2? R at 3? E at 4? W at 5? 
We introduce T,H,W? and R and E? 
E not at 5? good.

Similarly? we can consider ""DETER"": but has E twice? D? E? T? E? R? 
Letters: D?E?T?E?R? so D,T,R,E? 
But we already know E? and DETER? E at position 2 and 4? 
But it's a word? 

Perhaps THREW is better? 

I think THREW is a good choice? 

But what about vowel? we tested many? only E? and secret might have O? or U? 

In RAISE? we had vowels A? I? E? but only E is present? so the word contains E? and possibly no other vowels? or with consonants? 

For example? ""THREW"" has E? so it tests E? 

So? I'll use THREW? 

But note: THREW has no O? which is a vowel? we don't know if O is present? 

But we want to test common consonants? 

Another word? ""PROBE"": has O? not A? I? S? P R O B E? 
Letters: P?R?O?B?E? 
And E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5 because feedback already showed E is not at position 5? 
Thus? ""PROBE"" would have E at position 5? which is not allowed? so it's a bad guess? 

Therefore? avoid ending in E? 

So ""CRONE"" is bad? etc? 

So THREW? we can do? 

THREW:
Guessing THREW? 

<guess>THREW</guess> 

But let me finalize? 

I think it's fine? 

Let me go with ""THREW"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R and E are present in the secret word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- A, I, and S are absent from the word.

The new guess must:
- Exclude A, I, and S.
- Include R (any position except 1) and E (any position except 5).
- Test new common consonants to gather more information.

Reasoning step by step:
1. **Avoid forbidden positions**: Since R cannot be in position 1 and E cannot be in position 5, the guess must place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
2. **Introduce new letters**: Choose high-frequency consonants like T, H, W, N, L, or D to maximize information gain. Vowels are limited (only O, U, or Y are possible besides E, as A and I are ruled out).
3. **Word selection**: ""THREW"" is suitable because:
   - It includes E (position 4) and R (position 3), avoiding the forbidden positions.
   - It introduces T, H, W—new letters for further testing.
   - It contains no A, I, or S.
   - It's a valid English word and helps position R and E in new slots.

This guess will help confirm positions for R and E while testing three new letters.

<guess>THREW</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

**Guess 2: THREW**
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- H(x): H is not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed R in position 3).
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position. Position 4? Let's note: THREW positions are:
  - Pos1: T (x)
  - Pos2: H (x)
  - Pos3: R (-)
  - Pos4: E (✓)
  - Pos5: W (x)
So E is at position 4 and it is correct. Therefore, the secret word must have E in position 4.

Also, from THREW:
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we put R at position 3 and it got (-), meaning it is elsewhere).
- We now know that E is fixed at position 4.

**Consolidated Information:**
1. **Fixed so far:**
   - Position 4: Must be E.

2. **Present letters:**
   - R: must be in the word but not at position 1 (from RAISE) and not at position 3 (from THREW). So possible positions for R: 2 or 5.
   - E: confirmed at position 4.

3. **Absent letters:**
   - A, I, S, T, H, W.
   - From RAISE: A, I, S are absent.
   - From THREW: T, H, W are absent.

4. **Unknown letters:**
   - The secret word has 5 letters. We know position 4 is E, and R is present (somewhere else). So the other three letters are unknown but must not be the absent ones.
   - We have tested: R,A,I,S,E,T,H,W. So missing letters include B,C,D,F,G,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,Y, etc.

5. **Requirements for new guess:**
   - Must have E at position 4.
   - Must not contain any of the absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W.
   - Must include R if we haven't yet found its position? But we know R is present? Or is R already placed? No, we know R is present but not placed? Actually, from previous guesses, R must be in the word? And E is fixed at 4? Position 4 is occupied by E? So R must be in positions 2 or 5? We need to determine where R is? And also the remaining letters? And also we have no information about the other positions? 

But note: the secret word has E at position 4? and R present? and the rest? So positions 1,2,3,5 must be filled with letters that are not absent? But we don't know what they are? We have only negative information? 

The new guess must include E at position 4? and R must be in the word? in 2 or 5? but we don't know? So we need to put R at position 2 or 5 to test? And we need to fill the other positions with new letters? to test? 

Since we have limited guesses? we can try to include possible positions for R and test common other letters? 

Also? note: the secret word has exactly 5 letters? with E at position 4? R somewhere? and the other letters? 

But we know that R cannot be at position 1 or 3? so positions 2 or 5? 

So? for the new guess? we must have E at position 4? and we can place R at either 2 or 5? to see? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

Let me propose words? 

Constraints: 
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- The word cannot have A, I, S, T, H, W.
- Must include R (since it's present? unless? but feedback says R is present? so yes? if we omit R? it won't satisfy? So yes? must include R) in a position other than 1 and 3? but in the guess? we can put R at 2 or 5? 

So possible words: 

List of 5-letter words with E at position 4? and that have R? and without A,I,S,T,H,W? 

Structure: 
Pos1: ? 
Pos2: ? or R? 
Pos3: ? 
Pos4: E 
Pos5: ? or R? (if R is not at Pos2? then at Pos5? or if we put R at Pos2? we can test that)

Let me think of words:

Option 1: Put R at position 2? 
Format: letter at1? R? letter at3? E? letter at5? 
For example: C R ? E ? 

Words: 
- ""CRUEL"": but has U? E? L? 
  - But position5: L?
  - But is L okay? We haven't tested L? and CRUEL: C,R,U,E,L -> 
  - Valid? E at4? 
  - But U and L are new? 
  - However, does it contain absent letters? A,I,S,T,H,W? no? T,H,W are absent? T is in absent? but CRUEL has no T,H,W? So okay? 

But wait? CRUEL? position3 is U? position5 is L? 

But we also need to verify if it contains R? at position2? yes? 

Now? what if R is not at position2? What if R is at position5? Then CRUEL would put R at2? which might be wrong? 

We could instead put R at position5? to test? 

Another word: with R at position5? Format: ? ? ? E R? 
For example: ""FLEER"": but has F? L? E? E? R? 
But FL E E R? positions: 
1:F? 2:L? 3:E? 4:E? but position4 must be E? but in FLEER? position4 would be E? and position5:R? 
But note: FLEER? isn't a common word? 
Also? we tested E? and we have E at position3? which we don't know? 

Actually? FLEER? is a word? but let's look for common words? 

Better: ""QUEER"": Q?U?E?E?R? but Q and U at positions 1 and 2? and E at position3? which we don't care? E at position4? and R at5? 

Also? QUEER has E twice? 
But? we don't know about duplicate? 

Similarly? ""PLIER"": but has I? ruled out? 

""AUDIO"": ruled out? 

So? words with R at5: 
Examples: ""POWER"": but has W? W is absent? 
""BEVER"": not a word? 
""DEMUR"": D?E?M?U?R -> positions: D at1? E at2? but position4 must be E? so not? 

Format for R at5: we need position4 to be E? and position5 to be R? So words ending with ""ER"": 
Pattern: ? ? ? E R? 

Common words: 
- ""CIDER"": C,I,D? I is absent? invalid? 
- ""DINER"": has I? invalid? 
- ""FIGHTER"": too long? 
- ""LIKER"": has I? 
- ""MOWER"": has W? 
- ""NUDER"": not common? 
- ""RACER"": has A? invalid? 
- ""RAMEN"": not 5? 
- ""REPER"": not word? 
- ""RIPER"": has I? 
- ""ROGER"": O? G? E? R? but positions: R at1? O at2? G at3? E at4? R at5? 
But in ROGER? position1: R? but we cannot put R at position1? because we know R is not at position1? from RAISE? 
So ROGER is invalid? because it has R at1? 

Similarly? words starting with R are invalid? 

So words ending with ER? without absent letters? avoiding A,I,S,T,H,W? and not starting with R? 

For example: ""BEEFY"": not ends with ER? 
""CYBER"": but positions: 
If C Y B E R? positions: E at4? R at5? 
And C?Y?B? are new? 
And CYBER? word? 

CYBER: 
- C(1)? new
- Y(2)? new? and vowel or consonant? 
- B(3)? new
- E(4)? fixed
- R(5)? which we want to test? possible R at position5? 

Also? no absent letters? 

But note? the secret word? must have E at position4? and R? which CYBER places R at5? 

Alternatively? ""GONER"": G? O? N? E? R? 
Positions: G(1)? O(2)? N(3)? E(4)? R(5)? 
Similarly? not absent?

And I? S? etc? no? 

Similarly? ""HOMER"": H is absent? from THREW? H(x)? so cannot have H? 

Therefore? CYBER? GONER? etc? 

But why not? 

Also? CYBER? GONER introduce new letters? 

Let's go back: I need to guess a word that:

- Position 4: E
- Must include R? at position 2 or 5? 
- And other letters not in absent set? 

But also? we can put R at multiple positions? or just one? Since the secret has R exactly once? or possibly twice? but we don't know? Each guess is interpreted individually? 

In CYBER? R is only at position5? 

Similarly? for position2? Like CRUEL? 

Now? the choice: should I put R at position2 or position5? 

Since we know R cannot be at position1 or 3? it must be at position2 or position5? 

So if I put R at position2 in this guess? and it's correct? we get ✓? If not? then R must be at position5? because those are the only options? 

Similarly? if I put R at position5 and it's wrong? then we must put R at position2? 

So we can decide? 

But also? we can cover both? but with one guess? 

For example? if we put R at position2? and also test new letters? 

Or? we can put R at position5? 

But I want to maximize information about other letters? 

Perhaps? put R at position2? and include common new letters? 

So guess: ? R ? E ? 

Where positions 1,3,5 are new letters? 

Similarly? avoid absent letters? 

Or if we put R at position5? pattern: ? ? ? E R? 

But then positions 1,2,3 need to be filled? 

But note? in the second pattern? position3 is tested? 

From THREW? position3: R? got (-)? meaning the correct R is not at position3? but that doesn't tell us what letter is actually at position3? 

So we need to guess letters for positions 1,2,3? 

The same for positions 1,2,5? 

But we have E fixed at4? so position3 must be a letter? 

Both scenarios are symmetric? 

So let me choose to put R at position2? Then we can test:

For positions 1,3,5 with new letters? and R at2? E at4? 

Examples: 
- ""CRUEL"": C at1? R at2? U at3? E at4? L at5? 
  Letters: C,R,U,E,L? All new except R and E? 
  Absent letters? None? So okay? 

Another: ""DRIED"": D? R? I? E? D? But contains I? absent? invalid? 

""FREED"": F? R? E? E? D? But E twice? and E at position3? but position3? and position4:E? 
But note? position3 and position4 are different? 
FREED: 
1: F? 
2: R? 
3: E? But wait? we put E at position3? Now? from feedback? we know E is at position4? but we don't know about E elsewhere? 
If the secret word has only one E? then putting E at position3 would be useless? if it's not present? 
But FREED has E at position3? That's okay? 
But also? D at position5? 
But note? the secret word has E at position4? and we don't know if there are other E? 
So it could be? 
Also? FREED? does it contain S?A?I? no? But T?H?W? no? so okay? 
But E at position3: if there is no E at position3? it would show x? because E is present? so we would know? 

But let's focus? 
I think CRUEL is a valid word? and introduces C?U?L? 

Similarly? ""GRUEL"": G?R?U?E?L? same as CRUEL? 
Also valid? 

But either? 

I can also use ""PROWL"": but no? position4 must be E? 

Not: ""BRULE"": perhaps not common? 

So perhaps CRUEL or GRUEL? 

But GRUEL is more common? meaning? 

Alternatively? ""QUEEN"": Q?U?E?E?N? but E at position4? but position3 also E? 
And no R? we must include R? because R is present? we cannot omit R? 
So QUEEN does not contain R? invalid? 

Another word: ""CREWL"": not a word? 

So? CRUEL? 

But CRUEL? L at position5? 

Now? similarly? we can put R at position5? with GONER? etc? 

But let's choose putting R at position2? because position5 we haven't tested? and position2 we might need to confirm? 

Another word: ""DETER"": D?E?T?E?R? but T is absent? so cannot? because THREW said T(x). 

""PETER"": P?E?T?E?R? T absent? 

""BEVER"": not word? 

So back to? 

I think ""CRUEL"" or ""GRUEL"" or ""PRUDE"": PRUDE? P?R?U?D?E? positions: 
1:P? 
2:R? 
3:U? 
4:E? 
5:D -> D? 
But E at position4? 
And no absent letters? 
PRUDE is a valid word? 

So ""PRUDE"": P at1? R at2? U at3? D at5? 

Also? introduces P?R?U?D?E? but R and E known? 

Similarly? letters P,U,D? new? 

PRUDE vs CRUEL? 

PRUDE doesn't have C or L? 

But equally good? 

I'll choose ""PRUDE"" as the guess? 

But wait? both are okay? 

Alternatively? think about the most common letters: 
The remaining common consonants: B?C?D?F?G?L?M?N?O?P?Q?U?V?Y? 

So CRUEL: C,U?L? 
PRUDE: P?U?D? 

Perhaps similar? 

But let me try PRUDE? 

Why not? 

So? new guess: PRUDE? with E at4? R at2? 

In the feedback? for R? since we put R at position2? we will get: 
- If R is correct at2? then ✓ for R? 
- If R is in the word but not at2? then it must be at position5? therefore we get - for R? meaning R is misplaced? 

Similarly? for E? we already know E at4 is correct? so it will be ✓? 

And we'll learn about P? U? D? 

Similarly with other words? 

But also? note? if PRUDE? position3: U? which might be? 

So? let me use PRUDE? 

But one more thought: the secret word might have U? but we don't know? 

Also? GONER? for putting R at5? 

But let's not overcomplicate? I think PRUDE is fine? 

So? guess: ""PRUDE""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R is present but not pos 1, A/I/S absent, E present but not pos 5.
- **Guess 2 (THREW)**: T/H/W absent, R present but not pos 3, E is in the word and CORRECT at pos 4.

**Deductions:**
- E is fixed at position 4 in the secret word.
- R must be present but cannot be in positions 1 or 3, leaving only positions 2 or 5 possible.
- Absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W.
- The new guess must:
  - Have E in position 4.
  - Include R (in position 2 or 5 to test its location).
  - Exclude absent letters (A/I/S/T/H/W).
  - Test new common consonants for positions 1, 3, and 5.

**Word Choice Reasoning:**  
""PRUDE"" is selected because:
- Position 4: E (correct placement).
- Position 2: R (tests if R belongs here; feedback will indicate if correct or if R is in position 5).
- Positions 1, 3, 5: P, U, D (new high-frequency letters to probe).
- No absent letters and valid English word.

This guess efficiently narrows R's position (2 or 5) while testing three new letters.

There\'s no prior feedback to go on, so we want to pick a word that can provide a lot of information.\n Common strategies for the first word include using words with common letters and letters that are distinct to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback.\n For example, words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are often chosen because they contain common vowels and consonants.\n However, note that the game uses English 5-letter words.\n\n Let me think of a word that has letters that frequently appear in English words.\n Some popular starting words: ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"". \n\n I\'ll choose ""RAISE"": \n   - It has two vowels (A, I, E) and three consonants (R, S) which are common.\n   - It has distinct letters so we get information about five different letters.\n\n Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISEI\'m starting with ""RAISE"" as my first guess.

Note: In RAISE, E is the fifth letter, so the feedback E(-) means E is in the word but not in the fifth position.\n\nImportant deductions:\n1. The letters A, I, S are ABSENT from the secret word. So we must avoid words containing A, I, or S.\n2. R and E are present in the word, but:\n   - R is not in position 1 (where we guessed it).\n   - E is not in position 5 (where we guessed it).\n\nWe know the secret word contains R and E, but not A, I, S.\n\nSince there are no other letters reported, the word must consist of letters other than A, I, S. But note: we might have missed letters that weren\'t in RAISE.\n\nWe need to form a new guess that:\n- Excludes A, I, S.\n- Includes R and E (since they are present).\n- Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.\n\nAdditionally, we want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe also consider that perhaps the word has double letters? But since we got only two ""presents"" (R and E) and three absent (A,I,S), the word might have other letters we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we need to cover more ground.\n\nIdea: Use a word that has R and E in positions other than 1 and 5, and include three new common consonants.\n\nBut note: position matters. We know R can\'t be first, E can\'t be last.\n\nPossible positions for R: 2,3,4,5 (or possibly 1? no, because we got R(-) meaning it\'s misplaced, so not position 1). Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.\n\nAlso, since R and E are both in the word, we can try to put them in positions we haven\'t ruled out.\n\nFor example, if we put R in position 2, but we don\'t know if that\'s correct. We want to minimize conflicts.\n\nLet\'s think of words without A,I,S, and containing R and E.\n\nFirst, avoid A,I,S.\n\nConsider vowels: we know the word does not contain A or I, so the vowels can only be E (which we have), O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nWe already know E is in the word. What other vowels might be present? Let\'s try to include O and U to test.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n\nOption: PRONE? But P is new and O is new. However, PRONE: \n- P, R, O, N, E\nBut E is in position 5? We can\'t put E in position 5 because our feedback said E is not in position 5. But PRONE puts E in position 5 -> that\'s invalid. We must avoid putting E at the end.\n\nOption: RENEW? But has E twice? Also, S? No, avoid S. RENEW has double E? But not in the database necessarily.\n\nList of words with R and E, excluding A,I,S:\n\nWe can try words like:\n- BERGY: but not a common word? \n- Other words: CLEAR? But CLEAR has A -> invalid because A is ruled out.\n\nLet me think: \n- ""OLDER"": O,L,D,E,R -> letters: O,L,D,E,R -> contains R and E, and E not at end? O L D E R -> E is at position 4? Position indices: 1:O, 2:L, 3:D, 4:E, 5:R -> E is at 4 and R at 5. But we don\'t know about R position? We know R cannot be at position 1, but position 5 is okay? Similarly, E cannot be at position 5? Our feedback E(-) meant it was present but not in position 5. So in this case, position 4 is okay for E? Yes, and R at 5? We haven\'t ruled out R at 5? The feedback R(-) said R is not at position 1? So position 5 may be possible? Also, we haven\'t tested R at 5.\n\nBut note: in OLDER, E is at 4 and R at 5. Since E is not at 5, that\'s okay. R at 5: we don\'t have information against that.\n\nAlternatively, ""RECUT"": R,E,C,U,T -> R at 1? Can we put R at first? Our feedback said R is not in position 1? Since RAISE had R at first and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not position 1. Therefore, we cannot put R at position 1 again.\n\nSo in RECUT, if we put it as first guess with R at 1, it would violate? So avoid words starting with R.\n\nSimilarly, E cannot be at position 5. So our guess must not start with R and not end with E.\n\nSo back to OLDER: \n- It ends with R? Position 5: R is the fifth letter? We can do that? Because R not at position 1 is allowed at position 5?\n\nBut note: O L D E R -> positions:\n1: O (new)\n2: L (new)\n3: D (new)\n4: E (which we know is present, but we are putting at 4 -> not 5, so okay)\n5: R (which we know is present? But we don\'t know about position 5? We only know R is not at position 1? Position 5 could be okay? But we haven\'t guessed R at 5 yet? So it might be correct or not? We\'ll get feedback.)\n\nAlso, all letters are new except R and E? We are introducing O, L, D, and R and E? Actually we are retesting E? But that\'s fine.\n\nBut the word must have exactly the letters including R and E? And others? OLDER seems a valid word? It means someone who is old.\n\nBut let me confirm: OLDER is an English word, yes.\n\nOther options: \n- ""BERET"": has E twice? But that\'s okay? But BERET: B E R E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:E, 5:T -> E at position 2 and 4? So we can test E? But the feedback already told us E is in the word? And E(-) means not at position 5? We put E at positions 2 and 4? Which is fine? But BERET has double E? That could be possible.\n\nBut BERET contains E multiple times? And the secret word might have two E? Or one? We don\'t know? Our feedback from RAISE had only one E reported? But that could be because there is one E? Or if there are two Es, and one was in a wrong position? In RAISE, E was at position 5? But we got E(-) meaning E is present? But if the secret word had E elsewhere? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple letters? Wait, normally in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess it once and it\'s correct? Actually, let me recall the rules? Our rules are: \n- ✓: correct letter and position\n- -: letter in the word but wrong position\n- x: letter not in word\n\nAlso, if you guess a letter not repeated, and it appears once in the secret? But if you guess a letter that appears twice? You get feedback accordingly? But in this case, RAISE has only one E? And we got E(-)? So the secret word has E? But if it has two Es? We don\'t know? Because we only guessed one? Similarly, if the secret word has only one E, that\'s fine.\n\nSo multiple occurrences are possible? But we don\'t know? We can\'t assume? So BERET might be a valid word? But it contains E twice? But that\'s okay? It\'s a word! Also, we avoid A,I,S? BERET excludes those? Yes.\n\nHowever, BERET: \n- We put E at position 2? Could E be at position 2? We don\'t know? And E at position 4? Similarly, R at position 3? We don\'t know.\n\nBut also note: in BERET, position 3: R? Could be? Because R is not at position 1? Position 3 is allowed? \n\nBut let me compare OLDER and BERET? We want to maximize information? OLDER: O,L,D,E,R -> five new letters? Actually E and R are repeats? But we also introduce O,L,D? That\'s three new consonants? \n\nSimilarly, BERET has B, E, R, E, T? So letters: B,E,R,T? With E repeated? So effectively testing B, E, R, T? and E? So not as efficient? Because we use a letter slot for E again? \n\nAlternatively, how about ""ENTER""? But that has E at position 1 and 4? And N,T? And R at 5? But E at position 1? That could be? Because we don\'t have information against E at position 1? Our feedback was only that E is not at position 5? Position 1 is open? But ENTER ends with R? position 5? But let\'s see: E at 1: not tested before? However, we also have R at 5? \n\nBut ENTER? The word? Yes? \n\nBut perhaps better is to avoid putting E at position 1 until we know? Because we have E? Already? And R? \n\nI think OLDER is a good candidate? Because:\n- It doesn\'t start with R? Correct? OLDER starts with O?\n- It has E at position 4? Not 5? \n- It has R at position 5? Which we haven\'t tried? \n- We introduce O, L, D? Which are common? \n\nSo OLDER: O (position 1? new), L (2? new), D (3? new), E (4? we know E is present now at 4? must not be 5?), R (5? known letter? but new position?).\n\nBut we have confirmed E is in the word? So putting E at position 4? If it is correct? We get ✓? Or if it should be elsewhere? We get -? \n\nSimilarly? R at 5? could be correct? \n\nNow? another word? ""CORED"": C,O,R,E,D? But that has R at position 3? and E at position 4? And ends with D? So E not at 5? acceptable? \n\nBut let me see? which one gives better coverage: OLDER or similar? \n\nI also think about words that have R not at position 1? E not at position 5? and include common letters? \n\nFor example? ""PROTE"": not a word? How about ""TRIED"": but T? R? I? no? we cannot use I because we ruled out I? TRIED has I? invalid? \n\nAnother: ""CRONE"": C,R,O,N,E? but E at position 5? which is forbidden? Cannot guess? so if we guess CRONE? with E at 5? the feedback would immediately flag as wrong because E cannot be there? \n\nSimilarly? words ending with E are bad? \n\nSo? let\'s choose OLDER? \n\nWhat about ""RODEO"": but that has A? O? and sometimes Y? not? RODEO: R,O,D,E,O -> has O twice? and E at position 4? but we have R at position 1? we cannot put R at position 1? because our feedback said R not at 1? \n\nSo R must be placed differently? \n\nTherefore? OLDER? Let\'s write it:\n\nOLDER: \nPosition 1: O? new \nPosition 2: L? new \nPosition 3: D? new \nPosition 4: E? known? \nPosition 5: R? known? \n\nBut note: what if the secret word has R at position 5? But that might be? \n\nAlternatively? a word with R at position 2? E elsewhere? \n\nFor example? ""TREAD"": but A is invalid? \n\n""URBED"": not common? \n\n""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T? E at position 3? and ends with T? so E not at 5? acceptable? but R is at position 2? Position indices: 1:C,2:R,3:E,4:P,5:T? \nCan we put R at position 2? Yes? because we only ruled out position 1? \n\nBut CREPT? is that a word? Crept is the past tense of creep? yes? \n\nSimilarly? CREPT: letters are C,R,E,P,T? all valid? no S,A,I? \n\nAnd we introduce C,R,E,P,T? but R and E are already known? So new letters: C,P,T? \nCompared to OLDER? OLDER introduces O,L,D? \n\nBoth introduce three new letters? \n\nBut CREPT has E at position 3? which may be less common? or more? \n\nI think OLDER is fine? but CREPT also? \n\nAnother option: ""OPTER"": not common? \n\n""BLUER"": but has U? and ends with R? but B,L,U,E,R? U test? \n\nBut perhaps we should avoid vowels? we already know about E? and A,I are out? so O and U are possible? \n\nI think both OLDER and CREPT are acceptable? \n\nI\'ll go with CREPT? wait? let\'s compare:\n\nOLDER: if we guess OLDER and secret word has E elsewhere? then E at 4 would show -? and R at 5? similarly? \n\nBut we want to test new letters? \n\nAnother word? ""THREW"": T,H,R,E,W? has E at position 4? and R at position 3? \n\nTHREW? T(1),H(2),R(3),E(4),W(5)? So E not at 5? okay? and R not at 1? okay? \n\nAnd letters: T,H,R,E,W? introduce T? H? W? plus R and E? \n\nThat\'s three new letters? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nBut perhaps THREW is common? \n\nAfter consideration? I choose CREPT? because C,P,T? are common? and CREPT is a word? \n\nBut CREPT: \nC(1)? new \nR(2)? known? but at new position? \nE(3)? known? at new position? \nP(4)? new \nT(5)? new \n\nThis also? not at forbidden positions? \n\nNow? since E in RAISE was at position 5? and we said E is present? so it\'s likely in another position? we have many possibilities? \n\nI will go with CREPT. I think it covers with R at position 2? E at position 3? which weren\'t tested? \n\nSo let\'s decide: CREPT? \n\nBut RE is consecutive? might be less likely? but we don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively? another word? like ""CORBY"": not common? \n\n""GONER"": has E? ends with R? E is at position 4? O,K? but G O N E R? \nPosition: 1:G?2:O?3:N?4:E?5:R -> E not at 5? acceptable? \nAnd letters: G?O?N?E?R? introduce G?O?N? \nBut we have E at same position? \n\nThe point is: both are valid? \n\nBut after more thought: it might be better to cover more common? \nSo OLDER? CREPT? THREW? BERET? \n\nI think CREPT or THREW? \n\nLet me pick THREW? \n\nWait? no? because I don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively? let\'s choose a word containing R and E and other letters? I\'ll go with ""THREW""?\n\nBut THREW: T H R E W? \nT at 1? H at 2? R at 3? E at 4? W at 5? \nWe introduce T,H,W? and R and E? \nE not at 5? good.\n\nSimilarly? we can consider ""DETER"": but has E twice? D? E? T? E? R? \nLetters: D?E?T?E?R? so D,T,R,E? \nBut we already know E? and DETER? E at position 2 and 4? \nBut it\'s a word? \n\nPerhaps THREW is better? \n\nI think THREW is a good choice? \n\nBut what about vowel? we tested many? only E? and secret might have O? or U? \n\nIn RAISE? we had vowels A? I? E? but only E is present? so the word contains E? and possibly no other vowels? or with consonants? \n\nFor example? ""THREW"" has E? so it tests E? \n\nSo? I\'ll use THREW? \n\nBut note: THREW has no O? which is a vowel? we don\'t know if O is present? \n\nBut we want to test common consonants? \n\nAnother word? ""PROBE"": has O? not A? I? S? P R O B E? \nLetters: P?R?O?B?E? \nAnd E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5 because feedback already showed E is not at position 5? \nThus? ""PROBE"" would have E at position 5? which is not allowed? so it\'s a bad guess? \n\nTherefore? avoid ending in E? \n\nSo ""CRONE"" is bad? etc? \n\nSo THREW? we can do? \n\nTHREW:\nGuessing THREW? \n\n<guess>THREW</guess> \n\nBut let me finalize? \n\nI think it\'s fine? \n\nLet me go with ""THREW"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R and E are present in the secret word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.\n- A, I, and S are absent from the word.\n\nThe new guess must:\n- Exclude A, I, and S.\n- Include R (any position except 1) and E (any position except 5).\n- Test new common consonants to gather more information.\n\nReasoning step by step:\n1. **Avoid forbidden positions**: Since R cannot be in position 1 and E cannot be in position 5, the guess must place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n2. **Introduce new letters**: Choose high-frequency consonants like T, H, W, N, L, or D to maximize information gain. Vowels are limited (only O, U, or Y are possible besides E, as A and I are ruled out).\n3. **Word selection**: ""THREW"" is suitable because:\n   - It includes E (position 4) and R (position 3), avoiding the forbidden positions.\n   - It introduces T, H, W—new letters for further testing.\n   - It contains no A, I, or S.\n   - It\'s a valid English word and helps position R and E in new slots.\n\nThis guess will help confirm positions for R and E while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>THREW</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n**Guess 1: RAISE**\n- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.\n- A(x): A is not in the word.\n- I(x): I is not in the word.\n- S(x): S is not in the word.\n- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\n**Guess 2: THREW**\n- T(x): T is not in the word.\n- H(x): H is not in the word.\n- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed R in position 3).\n- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position.

GONER introduce new letters? \n\nLet\'s go back: I need to guess a word that:\n\n- Position 4: E\n- Must include R? at position 2 or 5? \n- And other letters not in absent set? \n\nBut also? we can put R at multiple positions? or just one? Since the secret has R exactly once? or possibly twice? but we don\'t know? Each guess is interpreted individually? \n\nIn CYBER? R is only at position5? \n\nSimilarly? for position2? Like CRUEL? \n\nNow? the choice: should I put R at position2 or position5? \n\nSince we know R cannot be at position1 or 3? it must be at position2 or position5? \n\nSo if I put R at position2 in this guess? and it\'s correct? we get ✓? If not? then R must be at position5? because those are the only options? \n\nSimilarly? if I put R at position5 and it\'s wrong? then we must put R at position2? \n\nSo we can decide? \n\nBut also? we can cover both? but with one guess? \n\nFor example? if we put R at position2? and also test new letters? \n\nOr? we can put R at position5? \n\nBut I want to maximize information about other letters? \n\nPerhaps? put R at position2? and include common new letters? \n\nSo guess: ? R ? E ? \n\nWhere positions 1,3,5 are new letters? \n\nSimilarly? avoid absent letters? \n\nOr if we put R at position5? pattern: ? ? ? E R? \n\nBut then positions 1,2,3 need to be filled? \n\nBut note? in the second pattern? position3 is tested? \n\nFrom THREW? position3: R? got (-)? meaning the correct R is not at position3? but that doesn\'t tell us what letter is actually at position3? \n\nSo we need to guess letters for positions 1,2,3? \n\nThe same for positions 1,2,5? \n\nBut we have E fixed at4? so position3 must be a letter? \n\nBoth scenarios are symmetric? \n\nSo let me choose to put R at position2? Then we can test:\n\nFor positions 1,3,5 with new letters? and R at2? E at4? \n\nExamples: \n- ""CRUEL"": C at1? R at2? U at3? E at4? L at5? \n  Letters: C,R,U,E,L?

Now? from feedback? we know E is at position4? but we don\'t know about E elsewhere? \nIf the secret word has only one E? then putting E at position3 would be useless? if it\'s not present? \nBut FREED has E at position3?

But T?H?W? no? so okay? \nBut E at position3: if there is no E at position3? it would show x? because E is present? so we would know? \n\nBut let\'s focus? \nI think CRUEL is a valid word? and introduces C?U?L? \n\nSimilarly?

""QUEEN"": Q?U?E?E?N? but E at position4? but position3 also E? \nAnd no R? we must include R? because R is present? we cannot omit R? \nSo QUEEN does not contain R? invalid? \n\nAnother word: ""CREWL"": not a word? \n\nSo?

R at2? \n\nIn the feedback? for R? since we put R at position2? we will get: \n- If R is correct at2? then ✓ for R? \n- If R is in the word but not at2? then it must be at position5? therefore we get - for R? meaning R is misplaced? \n\nSimilarly? for E? we already know E at4 is correct? so it will be ✓? \n\nAnd we\'ll learn about P?

We have the following feedback history:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: present but not in position 1 (so R is in the word, but not at index 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present but not in position 5 (so E is in the word, but not at index 5)

Guess 2: THREW
- T: absent
- H: absent
- R: present but not in position 3 (so R is in the word, but not at index 3)
- E: correct at position 4 (so the secret word has E at position 4)
- W: absent

Guess 3: PRUDE
- P: absent
- R: present but not in position 2 (so R is in the word, but not at index 2)
- U: absent
- D: absent
- E: present but not in position 4? Wait, this is confusing because in PRUDE, E is at position 4, but the feedback says E(-) meaning it is present but not in the correct position? But we already know from guess 2 that E is correct at position 4.

This is a contradiction. Let me reexamine:

In guess 2 (THREW), we had E at position 4 marked as correct (✓). That means the secret word has E at position 4.

In guess 3 (PRUDE), we also put E at position 4. Since the secret word has E at position 4, the feedback for E in PRUDE should be ✓, not (-). But the feedback says E(-), which would mean that E is in the word but not at position 4. This contradicts the previous feedback.

There must be a misunderstanding. Let me clarify the feedback format.

The feedback for PRUDE: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)

But E is at position 4 in PRUDE. If the secret word has E at position 4, then E should be marked as correct (✓), not (-). The (-) for E in PRUDE would imply that E is not at position 4 in the secret word? But that can't be because we already have E(✓) at position 4 from THREW.

This suggests an error in the feedback or in our understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is incorrect? Or maybe the secret word has only one E? But in THREW, E was at position 4 and correct, so it must be there.

Another possibility: the feedback for PRUDE's E is a mistake? But let's assume the feedback is correct.

Wait, the feedback for PRUDE: E(-) means that E is in the word but not at position 4? But that contradicts the fact that we have E at position 4 from THREW.

Unless... the secret word has multiple E's? For example, if the secret word has E at position 4 and another E elsewhere, then in PRUDE, we have E at position 4 which is correct, so it should be ✓, and if there is another E, then the E in PRUDE at position 4 would still be ✓ because it's the correct letter in the correct position.

The feedback symbol ✓ means correct letter and correct position, regardless of duplicates.

So if the secret word has E at position 4, then any guess that has E at position 4 must get a ✓ for that position.

Therefore, the feedback for E in PRUDE should be ✓, not (-). But it's given as (-), which is inconsistent.

This implies that the secret word does not have E at position 4? But that contradicts guess 2's feedback.

Perhaps I misremembered the position? Let's list the positions:

THREW: positions
1: T
2: H
3: R
4: E (marked ✓)
5: W

So E is at position 4 and correct.

PRUDE: positions
1: P
2: R
3: U
4: E
5: D

Feedback for PRUDE: P(x), R(-), U(x), D(x), E(-)

E at position 4 is marked as (-), meaning present but not at position 4? But that can't be if position 4 is E in the secret word.

Unless the feedback for E in PRUDE is for the letter E, but since it's at position 4 and the secret has E at position 4, it should be ✓.

This is a problem. Perhaps there is a misunderstanding of the feedback format.

Let me re-read the initial rules:

""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.""

In the case of PRUDE, if the secret word has E at position 4, then the E in position 4 of the guess must be ✓. But the feedback says E(-), which is wrong position. This is inconsistent.

Perhaps the secret word does not have E at position 4? But guess 2 said E(✓) at position 4.

Another idea: maybe the feedback for guess 2 was for THREW, and the secret word changed? But no, it's the same secret word.

Perhaps I have a bug in the interpretation.

Let's look at the feedback string for guess 3: ""P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)""

For E, it's (-), which means the letter E is in the word but not at position 4. But from guess 2, we know E is at position 4. Contradiction.

Unless in guess 2, the E was not at position 4? But the feedback said E(✓) for position 4.

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback provided, or in my reasoning.

Perhaps the position indexing is off? But I think it's standard.

Another possibility: in guess 2, THREW, the E was at position 4 and marked ✓, so that's fixed.

In guess 3, PRUDE, we have E at position 4, so it should be ✓. But the feedback says E(-), which is impossible.

Therefore, I must conclude that the feedback for E in PRUDE is incorrect as reported, or there is a misunderstanding.

But let's assume the feedback is correct and reexamine guess 2.

Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)

The feedback is given as ""E(✓)"", which should mean that the letter in the position of E in THREW (which is position 4) is correct.

Similarly, for PRUDE, ""E(-)"" means that the letter E in position 4 of PRUDE is not correct, but present elsewhere.

This is a direct contradiction.

Unless the secret word has two E's? Let's consider that.

Suppose the secret word has two E's. In THREW, we have E at position 4, which is one of the E's, so it gets ✓. In PRUDE, we have E at position 4, but if the secret word has E at position 4, it should be ✓. If the secret word has E at position 4, then PRUDE's E at 4 must be ✓.

The only way for PRUDE's E to be (-) is if the secret word has an E, but not at position 4. But that contradicts the ✓ from THREW.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the feedback for guess 3 is misreported or there is an error.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 2 was not E(✓) but something else? But it's given as E(✓).

Let's read the user's message: ""Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)""

Yes, E(✓).

For guess 3: ""Guess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)""

E(-).

This is inconsistent.

Perhaps the positions are 1-based, but maybe the feedback is per letter without position? But the feedback is for each letter in order.

I think I have to accept the feedback as given and assume that the secret word does not have E at position 4, which means the feedback for guess 2 was misinterpreted.

But that doesn't make sense.

Another idea: in guess 2, the feedback ""E(✓)"" might mean that E is in the word and in some position, but not necessarily position 4? No, the feedback is for the specific position.

The feedback is given for each letter in the order of the guess, so for THREW, the fourth letter E is correct.

Similarly for PRUDE, the fourth letter E is not correct, but E is in the word elsewhere.

This is impossible.

Unless the secret word changed, but it's the same game.

I think there might be a typo in the feedback for guess 3. Perhaps it's not E(-) but E(✓)? Or something else.

But I have to work with what's given.

Perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is for the letter, but since it's the same as position 4, it should be ✓.

I'm stuck.

Let's ignore the contradiction for a moment and list what we know.

From guess 1:
- R is in the word, not at position 1.
- A, I, S are absent.
- E is in the word, not at position 5.

From guess 2:
- T, H, W are absent.
- R is in the word, not at position 3.
- E is in the word and at position 4? But then from guess 3, E at position 4 is not correct, so let's not assume.

From guess 2 feedback E(✓), we must have E at position 4.

From guess 3 feedback E(-), we have that E is in the word but not at position 4.

Contradiction.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 3 is ""E(✓)"" but written as ""E(-)"" by mistake? That might be the case.

Or perhaps in the context, the E in PRUDE is at position 4, and if it's (-), it means that the secret word has E, but not at position 4, which contradicts.

I think I have to assume that the feedback for guess 3 is incorrect or that there's a misunderstanding of the position.

Another possibility: the feedback for PRUDE is for the letters, not positions? But the format is per position.

Let's read the initial example: ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)"" so it's for each letter in order.

Similarly, for PRUDE, ""P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)"" means:
- P at position 1: absent
- R at position 2: present but wrong position
- U at position 3: absent
- D at position 4: absent? Wait, no, D is at position 5? Let's see:

PRUDE: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: R
Position 3: U
Position 4: E
Position 5: D

Feedback: P(x) for position 1, R(-) for position 2, U(x) for position 3, D(x) for position 5? But the feedback says ""D(x) E(-)"", so D(x) is for position 5, and E(-) for position 4.

E at position 4 is marked as (-), meaning present but not at position 4.

But from guess 2, position 4 is E and correct.

This is the contradiction.

Unless in guess 2, the E was not at position 4? But it was.

I think I have to proceed by ignoring the E feedback from guess 3 or something.

Perhaps the secret word has only one E, and in guess 2, E at position 4 was correct, so in guess 3, E at position 4 should be correct, so the feedback must be E(✓), but it's given as E(-), so maybe it's a typo and it's E(✓).

Otherwise, the game is inconsistent.

For the sake of progressing, I will assume that the feedback for E in PRUDE is a mistake and it should be E(✓), because of the previous feedback.

Perhaps the user meant E(✓) but typed E(-) by error.

Because otherwise, it's impossible.

So I'll assume that for PRUDE, E should be E(✓), and the feedback is misstated.

So corrected feedback for PRUDE: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(✓)

Then it makes sense.

Because E at position 4 is correct.

Then R at position 2 is present but not at 2, so R is not at position 2.

P, U, D are absent.

So let's assume that.

Otherwise, we can't proceed.

So from now on, I'll assume the feedback for E in PRUDE is ✓.

So:

Guess 3: PRUDE feedback: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(✓)

Then:

- P: absent
- R: present but not at position 2 (so R not at 2)
- U: absent
- D: absent
- E: correct at position 4

Now, from previous:

- R is present, not at position 1 (from RAISE), not at position 3 (from THREW), not at position 2 (from PRUDE), so R must be at position 5.

Positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

R cannot be at 1,2,3, so only position 5 left.

Also, E is at position 4.

Absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D.

Present letters: R, E, and three others.

R must be at position 5.

So secret word: _ _ _ E R

Positions: 1,2,3 are unknown, 4:E, 5:R.

Letters to fill: three letters, not in absent set.

Absent: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D

So available letters: B,C,F,G,L,M,N,O,Q,V,Y,Z, etc. But common letters.

We need to guess a word of the form _ _ _ E R, with the first three letters not absent.

New guess must have E at 4, R at 5, and positions 1,2,3 with new letters.

For example, ""BOXER"", but X might not be common.

""BOXER"": B,O,X,E,R

Check absent: B not absent, O not absent, X not tested, E and R known.

But X is less common.

""JOKER"": J,O,K,E,R

J and K not tested.

But let's think of common letters.

Since we have few guesses left, we can try to cover common letters.

Available common consonants: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, Y

Vowels: O, and sometimes Y.

But we have position 1,2,3 to fill.

For example, ""LONER"": L,O,N,E,R

But N is common.

LONER: positions 1:L, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R

Check absent: L not absent, O not absent, N not absent.

Similarly, ""GONER"": G,O,N,E,R

G not absent.

But G was not tested.

Another: ""MINER"": but M not absent, but I is absent, so invalid.

I is absent, so no.

""COVER"": C,O,V,E,R

C, O, V not absent.

V is less common.

""BOXER"" is a word.

But let's list possible words: _ _ _ E R

With the first three letters from: B,C,F,G,L,M,N,O,Q,V,Y

Common words: 
- LOVER: L,O,V,E,R -> V is not common, but valid.
- MOWER: but W is absent.
- POWER: W absent.
- HOMER: H absent.
- So not.

""BAKER"": B,A,K,E,R but A absent.

A is absent.

""MAKER"": A absent.

""RACER"": A absent.

So no A.

""FEWER"": F,E,W,E,R but W absent and E repeated.

W absent.

""JEWEL"": not E R ending.

So perhaps ""BOXER"", ""JOKER"", ""CODER"" but D absent.

D is absent from PRUDE feedback.

D(x) so absent.

So no D.

""COVER"" is good.

Or ""LOVER"".

But let's choose ""COVER"": C,O,V,E,R

Introduces C,O,V.

But V is not very common, but it's a word.

""COMER"": C,O,M,E,R

M not absent.

""COMER"" is a word.

Similarly, ""CORER"": but O at position 2, R at position 3? But R is at position 5, and we have only one R? But ""CORER"" has two R's? C,O,R,E,R -> positions: 1:C,2:O,3:R,4:E,5:R

But we have R at position 3 and 5. But from feedback, R is present, but we don't know about duplicates.

In this case, if we guess ""CORER"", and secret has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked differently.

But it's messy.

Better to avoid duplicates for now.

So ""COMER"": C,O,M,E,R

Positions: 1:C,2:O,3:M,4:E,5:R

All new letters except E and R.

And C,O,M not absent.

Similarly, ""COVER"" has V.

I think ""COMER"" is better.

But ""COMER"" is a word? It means one who comes, like in ""newcomer"", but as a standalone, it might be accepted.

Another common word: ""BOXER"" or ""JOKER"".

""JOKER"" is common.

J is not absent.

So let's go with ""JOKER"".

Guess: JOKER

But J is not very common, but it's a valid guess.

To maximize information, we can choose a word with common letters.

Available common letters: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, O, Y

For example, ""LONER"": L,O,N,E,R

L, O, N are common.

Similarly, ""GONER"": G,O,N,E,R

G and N common.

Or ""BONER"": B,O,N,E,R - also a word.

But let's choose ""LONER"".

So new guess: LONER

Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R

We will get feedback on L, O, N.

If any are correct or present.

But since we have to guess, and we know E and R are fixed.

So <guess>LONER</guess>

But we have the contradiction issue.

Perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is correct, and we have to rethink.

But I think for the sake of continuing, I'll go with LONER.

So in the response, I'll assume the feedback for E in PRUDE is E(✓) implicitly.

So summary for new guess:

Secret word has E at 4, R at 5, and positions 1,2,3 to be guessed.

Absent letters: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D

So guess ""LONER"" to test L, O, N.

<guess>LONER</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:
     - R: Present but not in position 1.
     - A, I, S: Absent.
     - E: Present but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (THREW)**:
     - T, H, W: Absent.
     - R: Present but not in position 3.
     - E: Correct at position 4 (secret word has E in position 4).
   - **Guess 3 (PRUDE)**:
     - P, U, D: Absent.
     - R: Present but not in position 2.
     - E: Feedback is ""E(-)"", but this conflicts with Guess 2's ""E(✓)"" at position 4. After re-evaluating, the feedback for E in PRUDE must be inconsistent due to a possible error, as E cannot be both correct at position 4 (from THREW) and misplaced in the same position (PRUDE). For consistency, I'll treat E as correct at position 4, as established by Guess 2.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **E is fixed at position 4**: Confirmed by Guess 2's feedback.
   - **R must be at position 5**: 
     - R is present but cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE), position 3 (from THREW), or position 2 (from PRUDE). The only remaining position is 5.
   - **Absent letters**: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D (from all feedback).
   - **Secret word structure**: The secret word is `_ _ _ E R`, with positions 1, 2, and 3 unknown.
   - **Available letters**: Must be from the remaining letters not absent (B, C, F, G, L, M, N, O, Q, V, Y, etc.). Common consonants like B, C, F, G, L, M, N and vowels like O, Y are prioritized for information gain.

3. **Strategy for New Guess**:
   - The new guess must have E at position 4 and R at position 5 to confirm R's placement.
   - Positions 1, 2, and 3 should test new high-frequency letters to maximize information (e.g., L, O, N, M, C).
   - Avoid absent letters and reuse of known letters (only E and R are confirmed present).
   - ""LONER"" is chosen because:
     - Structure: `L O N E R` (E at 4, R at 5).
     - Tests L (position 1), O (position 2), and N (position 3)—all common letters not yet tested.
     - Valid English word, fitting the pattern `_ _ _ E R`.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If L, O, or N are correct, we narrow down the secret word quickly.
   - If all are absent, we eliminate three common letters and focus on other options (e.g., C, M, G).

<guess>LONER</guess>",LONER,"We have the following feedback history:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: present but not in position 1 (so R is in the word, but not at index 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present but not in position 5 (so E is in the word, but not at index 5)

Guess 2: THREW
- T: absent
- H: absent
- R: present but not in position 3 (so R is in the word, but not at index 3)
- E: correct at position 4 (so the secret word has E at position 4)
- W: absent

Guess 3: PRUDE
- P: absent
- R: present but not in position 2 (so R is in the word, but not at index 2)
- U: absent
- D: absent
- E: present but not in position 4? Wait, this is confusing because in PRUDE, E is at position 4, but the feedback says E(-) meaning it is present but not in the correct position? But we already know from guess 2 that E is correct at position 4.

This is a contradiction. Let me reexamine:

In guess 2 (THREW), we had E at position 4 marked as correct (✓). That means the secret word has E at position 4.

In guess 3 (PRUDE), we also put E at position 4. Since the secret word has E at position 4, the feedback for E in PRUDE should be ✓, not (-). But the feedback says E(-), which would mean that E is in the word but not at position 4. This contradicts the previous feedback.

There must be a misunderstanding. Let me clarify the feedback format.

The feedback for PRUDE: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)

But E is at position 4 in PRUDE. If the secret word has E at position 4, then E should be marked as correct (✓), not (-). The (-) for E in PRUDE would imply that E is not at position 4 in the secret word? But that can't be because we already have E(✓) at position 4 from THREW.

This suggests an error in the feedback or in our understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is incorrect? Or maybe the secret word has only one E? But in THREW, E was at position 4 and correct, so it must be there.

Another possibility: the feedback for PRUDE's E is a mistake? But let's assume the feedback is correct.

Wait, the feedback for PRUDE: E(-) means that E is in the word but not at position 4? But that contradicts the fact that we have E at position 4 from THREW.

Unless... the secret word has multiple E's? For example, if the secret word has E at position 4 and another E elsewhere, then in PRUDE, we have E at position 4 which is correct, so it should be ✓, and if there is another E, then the E in PRUDE at position 4 would still be ✓ because it's the correct letter in the correct position.

The feedback symbol ✓ means correct letter and correct position, regardless of duplicates.

So if the secret word has E at position 4, then any guess that has E at position 4 must get a ✓ for that position.

Therefore, the feedback for E in PRUDE should be ✓, not (-). But it's given as (-), which is inconsistent.

This implies that the secret word does not have E at position 4? But that contradicts guess 2's feedback.

Perhaps I misremembered the position? Let's list the positions:

THREW: positions
1: T
2: H
3: R
4: E (marked ✓)
5: W

So E is at position 4 and correct.

PRUDE: positions
1: P
2: R
3: U
4: E
5: D

Feedback for PRUDE: P(x), R(-), U(x), D(x), E(-)

E at position 4 is marked as (-), meaning present but not at position 4? But that can't be if position 4 is E in the secret word.

Unless the feedback for E in PRUDE is for the letter E, but since it's at position 4 and the secret has E at position 4, it should be ✓.

This is a problem. Perhaps there is a misunderstanding of the feedback format.

Let me re-read the initial rules:

""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.""

In the case of PRUDE, if the secret word has E at position 4, then the E in position 4 of the guess must be ✓. But the feedback says E(-), which is wrong position. This is inconsistent.

Perhaps the secret word does not have E at position 4? But guess 2 said E(✓) at position 4.

Another idea: maybe the feedback for guess 2 was for THREW, and the secret word changed? But no, it's the same secret word.

Perhaps I have a bug in the interpretation.

Let's look at the feedback string for guess 3: ""P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)""

For E, it's (-), which means the letter E is in the word but not at position 4. But from guess 2, we know E is at position 4. Contradiction.

Unless in guess 2, the E was not at position 4? But the feedback said E(✓) for position 4.

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback provided, or in my reasoning.

Perhaps the position indexing is off? But I think it's standard.

Another possibility: in guess 2, THREW, the E was at position 4 and marked ✓, so that's fixed.

In guess 3, PRUDE, we have E at position 4, so it should be ✓. But the feedback says E(-), which is impossible.

Therefore, I must conclude that the feedback for E in PRUDE is incorrect as reported, or there is a misunderstanding.

But let's assume the feedback is correct and reexamine guess 2.

Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)

The feedback is given as ""E(✓)"", which should mean that the letter in the position of E in THREW (which is position 4) is correct.

Similarly, for PRUDE, ""E(-)"" means that the letter E in position 4 of PRUDE is not correct, but present elsewhere.

This is a direct contradiction.

Unless the secret word has two E's? Let's consider that.

Suppose the secret word has two E's. In THREW, we have E at position 4, which is one of the E's, so it gets ✓. In PRUDE, we have E at position 4, but if the secret word has E at position 4, it should be ✓. If the secret word has E at position 4, then PRUDE's E at 4 must be ✓.

The only way for PRUDE's E to be (-) is if the secret word has an E, but not at position 4. But that contradicts the ✓ from THREW.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the feedback for guess 3 is misreported or there is an error.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 2 was not E(✓) but something else? But it's given as E(✓).

Let's read the user's message: ""Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)""

Yes, E(✓).

For guess 3: ""Guess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)""

E(-).

This is inconsistent.

Perhaps the positions are 1-based, but maybe the feedback is per letter without position? But the feedback is for each letter in order.

I think I have to accept the feedback as given and assume that the secret word does not have E at position 4, which means the feedback for guess 2 was misinterpreted.

But that doesn't make sense.

Another idea: in guess 2, the feedback ""E(✓)"" might mean that E is in the word and in some position, but not necessarily position 4? No, the feedback is for the specific position.

The feedback is given for each letter in the order of the guess, so for THREW, the fourth letter E is correct.

Similarly for PRUDE, the fourth letter E is not correct, but E is in the word elsewhere.

This is impossible.

Unless the secret word changed, but it's the same game.

I think there might be a typo in the feedback for guess 3. Perhaps it's not E(-) but E(✓)? Or something else.

But I have to work with what's given.

Perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is for the letter, but since it's the same as position 4, it should be ✓.

I'm stuck.

Let's ignore the contradiction for a moment and list what we know.

From guess 1:
- R is in the word, not at position 1.
- A, I, S are absent.
- E is in the word, not at position 5.

From guess 2:
- T, H, W are absent.
- R is in the word, not at position 3.
- E is in the word and at position 4? But then from guess 3, E at position 4 is not correct, so let's not assume.

From guess 2 feedback E(✓), we must have E at position 4.

From guess 3 feedback E(-), we have that E is in the word but not at position 4.

Contradiction.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 3 is ""E(✓)"" but written as ""E(-)"" by mistake? That might be the case.

Or perhaps in the context, the E in PRUDE is at position 4, and if it's (-), it means that the secret word has E, but not at position 4, which contradicts.

I think I have to assume that the feedback for guess 3 is incorrect or that there's a misunderstanding of the position.

Another possibility: the feedback for PRUDE is for the letters, not positions? But the format is per position.

Let's read the initial example: ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)"" so it's for each letter in order.

Similarly, for PRUDE, ""P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)"" means:
- P at position 1: absent
- R at position 2: present but wrong position
- U at position 3: absent
- D at position 4: absent? Wait, no, D is at position 5? Let's see:

PRUDE: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: R
Position 3: U
Position 4: E
Position 5: D

Feedback: P(x) for position 1, R(-) for position 2, U(x) for position 3, D(x) for position 5? But the feedback says ""D(x) E(-)"", so D(x) is for position 5, and E(-) for position 4.

E at position 4 is marked as (-), meaning present but not at position 4.

But from guess 2, position 4 is E and correct.

This is the contradiction.

Unless in guess 2, the E was not at position 4? But it was.

I think I have to proceed by ignoring the E feedback from guess 3 or something.

Perhaps the secret word has only one E, and in guess 2, E at position 4 was correct, so in guess 3, E at position 4 should be correct, so the feedback must be E(✓), but it's given as E(-), so maybe it's a typo and it's E(✓).

Otherwise, the game is inconsistent.

For the sake of progressing, I will assume that the feedback for E in PRUDE is a mistake and it should be E(✓), because of the previous feedback.

Perhaps the user meant E(✓) but typed E(-) by error.

Because otherwise, it's impossible.

So I'll assume that for PRUDE, E should be E(✓), and the feedback is misstated.

So corrected feedback for PRUDE: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(✓)

Then it makes sense.

Because E at position 4 is correct.

Then R at position 2 is present but not at 2, so R is not at position 2.

P, U, D are absent.

So let's assume that.

Otherwise, we can't proceed.

So from now on, I'll assume the feedback for E in PRUDE is ✓.

So:

Guess 3: PRUDE feedback: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(✓)

Then:

- P: absent
- R: present but not at position 2 (so R not at 2)
- U: absent
- D: absent
- E: correct at position 4

Now, from previous:

- R is present, not at position 1 (from RAISE), not at position 3 (from THREW), not at position 2 (from PRUDE), so R must be at position 5.

Positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

R cannot be at 1,2,3, so only position 5 left.

Also, E is at position 4.

Absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D.

Present letters: R, E, and three others.

R must be at position 5.

So secret word: _ _ _ E R

Positions: 1,2,3 are unknown, 4:E, 5:R.

Letters to fill: three letters, not in absent set.

Absent: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D

So available letters: B,C,F,G,L,M,N,O,Q,V,Y,Z, etc. But common letters.

We need to guess a word of the form _ _ _ E R, with the first three letters not absent.

New guess must have E at 4, R at 5, and positions 1,2,3 with new letters.

For example, ""BOXER"", but X might not be common.

""BOXER"": B,O,X,E,R

Check absent: B not absent, O not absent, X not tested, E and R known.

But X is less common.

""JOKER"": J,O,K,E,R

J and K not tested.

But let's think of common letters.

Since we have few guesses left, we can try to cover common letters.

Available common consonants: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, Y

Vowels: O, and sometimes Y.

But we have position 1,2,3 to fill.

For example, ""LONER"": L,O,N,E,R

But N is common.

LONER: positions 1:L, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R

Check absent: L not absent, O not absent, N not absent.

Similarly, ""GONER"": G,O,N,E,R

G not absent.

But G was not tested.

Another: ""MINER"": but M not absent, but I is absent, so invalid.

I is absent, so no.

""COVER"": C,O,V,E,R

C, O, V not absent.

V is less common.

""BOXER"" is a word.

But let's list possible words: _ _ _ E R

With the first three letters from: B,C,F,G,L,M,N,O,Q,V,Y

Common words: 
- LOVER: L,O,V,E,R -> V is not common, but valid.
- MOWER: but W is absent.
- POWER: W absent.
- HOMER: H absent.
- So not.

""BAKER"": B,A,K,E,R but A absent.

A is absent.

""MAKER"": A absent.

""RACER"": A absent.

So no A.

""FEWER"": F,E,W,E,R but W absent and E repeated.

W absent.

""JEWEL"": not E R ending.

So perhaps ""BOXER"", ""JOKER"", ""CODER"" but D absent.

D is absent from PRUDE feedback.

D(x) so absent.

So no D.

""COVER"" is good.

Or ""LOVER"".

But let's choose ""COVER"": C,O,V,E,R

Introduces C,O,V.

But V is not very common, but it's a word.

""COMER"": C,O,M,E,R

M not absent.

""COMER"" is a word.

Similarly, ""CORER"": but O at position 2, R at position 3? But R is at position 5, and we have only one R? But ""CORER"" has two R's? C,O,R,E,R -> positions: 1:C,2:O,3:R,4:E,5:R

But we have R at position 3 and 5. But from feedback, R is present, but we don't know about duplicates.

In this case, if we guess ""CORER"", and secret has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked differently.

But it's messy.

Better to avoid duplicates for now.

So ""COMER"": C,O,M,E,R

Positions: 1:C,2:O,3:M,4:E,5:R

All new letters except E and R.

And C,O,M not absent.

Similarly, ""COVER"" has V.

I think ""COMER"" is better.

But ""COMER"" is a word? It means one who comes, like in ""newcomer"", but as a standalone, it might be accepted.

Another common word: ""BOXER"" or ""JOKER"".

""JOKER"" is common.

J is not absent.

So let's go with ""JOKER"".

Guess: JOKER

But J is not very common, but it's a valid guess.

To maximize information, we can choose a word with common letters.

Available common letters: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, O, Y

For example, ""LONER"": L,O,N,E,R

L, O, N are common.

Similarly, ""GONER"": G,O,N,E,R

G and N common.

Or ""BONER"": B,O,N,E,R - also a word.

But let's choose ""LONER"".

So new guess: LONER

Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R

We will get feedback on L, O, N.

If any are correct or present.

But since we have to guess, and we know E and R are fixed.

So <guess>LONER</guess>

But we have the contradiction issue.

Perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is correct, and we have to rethink.

But I think for the sake of continuing, I'll go with LONER.

So in the response, I'll assume the feedback for E in PRUDE is E(✓) implicitly.

So summary for new guess:

Secret word has E at 4, R at 5, and positions 1,2,3 to be guessed.

Absent letters: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D

So guess ""LONER"" to test L, O, N.

<guess>LONER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:
     - R: Present but not in position 1.
     - A, I, S: Absent.
     - E: Present but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (THREW)**:
     - T, H, W: Absent.
     - R: Present but not in position 3.
     - E: Correct at position 4 (secret word has E in position 4).
   - **Guess 3 (PRUDE)**:
     - P, U, D: Absent.
     - R: Present but not in position 2.
     - E: Feedback is ""E(-)"", but this conflicts with Guess 2's ""E(✓)"" at position 4. After re-evaluating, the feedback for E in PRUDE must be inconsistent due to a possible error, as E cannot be both correct at position 4 (from THREW) and misplaced in the same position (PRUDE). For consistency, I'll treat E as correct at position 4, as established by Guess 2.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **E is fixed at position 4**: Confirmed by Guess 2's feedback.
   - **R must be at position 5**: 
     - R is present but cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE), position 3 (from THREW), or position 2 (from PRUDE). The only remaining position is 5.
   - **Absent letters**: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D (from all feedback).
   - **Secret word structure**: The secret word is `_ _ _ E R`, with positions 1, 2, and 3 unknown.
   - **Available letters**: Must be from the remaining letters not absent (B, C, F, G, L, M, N, O, Q, V, Y, etc.). Common consonants like B, C, F, G, L, M, N and vowels like O, Y are prioritized for information gain.

3. **Strategy for New Guess**:
   - The new guess must have E at position 4 and R at position 5 to confirm R's placement.
   - Positions 1, 2, and 3 should test new high-frequency letters to maximize information (e.g., L, O, N, M, C).
   - Avoid absent letters and reuse of known letters (only E and R are confirmed present).
   - ""LONER"" is chosen because:
     - Structure: `L O N E R` (E at 4, R at 5).
     - Tests L (position 1), O (position 2), and N (position 3)—all common letters not yet tested.
     - Valid English word, fitting the pattern `_ _ _ E R`.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If L, O, or N are correct, we narrow down the secret word quickly.
   - If all are absent, we eliminate three common letters and focus on other options (e.g., C, M, G).",Guess 4: LONER -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,JOKER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There's no prior feedback to go on, so we want to pick a word that can provide a lot of information.
 Common strategies for the first word include using words with common letters and letters that are distinct to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback.
 For example, words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are often chosen because they contain common vowels and consonants.
 However, note that the game uses English 5-letter words.

 Let me think of a word that has letters that frequently appear in English words.
 Some popular starting words: ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"". 

 I'll choose ""RAISE"": 
   - It has two vowels (A, I, E) and three consonants (R, S) which are common.
   - It has distinct letters so we get information about five different letters.

 Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISEI'm starting with ""RAISE"" as my first guess. It's a strong opening word because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance of getting feedback about frequent letters. Since there's no prior information, this helps test multiple key letters at once.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We previously guessed RAISE and got feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- R is in the word but not in the first position.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the last position? Note: In RAISE, E is the fifth letter, so the feedback E(-) means E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Important deductions:
1. The letters A, I, S are ABSENT from the secret word. So we must avoid words containing A, I, or S.
2. R and E are present in the word, but:
   - R is not in position 1 (where we guessed it).
   - E is not in position 5 (where we guessed it).

We know the secret word contains R and E, but not A, I, S.

Since there are no other letters reported, the word must consist of letters other than A, I, S. But note: we might have missed letters that weren't in RAISE.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Excludes A, I, S.
- Includes R and E (since they are present).
- Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

Additionally, we want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also consider that perhaps the word has double letters? But since we got only two ""presents"" (R and E) and three absent (A,I,S), the word might have other letters we haven't tested.

We have 6 tries, so we need to cover more ground.

Idea: Use a word that has R and E in positions other than 1 and 5, and include three new common consonants.

But note: position matters. We know R can't be first, E can't be last.

Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5 (or possibly 1? no, because we got R(-) meaning it's misplaced, so not position 1). Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.

Also, since R and E are both in the word, we can try to put them in positions we haven't ruled out.

For example, if we put R in position 2, but we don't know if that's correct. We want to minimize conflicts.

Let's think of words without A,I,S, and containing R and E.

First, avoid A,I,S.

Consider vowels: we know the word does not contain A or I, so the vowels can only be E (which we have), O, U, and sometimes Y.

We already know E is in the word. What other vowels might be present? Let's try to include O and U to test.

Some words that come to mind:

Option: PRONE? But P is new and O is new. However, PRONE: 
- P, R, O, N, E
But E is in position 5? We can't put E in position 5 because our feedback said E is not in position 5. But PRONE puts E in position 5 -> that's invalid. We must avoid putting E at the end.

Option: RENEW? But has E twice? Also, S? No, avoid S. RENEW has double E? But not in the database necessarily.

List of words with R and E, excluding A,I,S:

We can try words like:
- BERGY: but not a common word? 
- Other words: CLEAR? But CLEAR has A -> invalid because A is ruled out.

Let me think: 
- ""OLDER"": O,L,D,E,R -> letters: O,L,D,E,R -> contains R and E, and E not at end? O L D E R -> E is at position 4? Position indices: 1:O, 2:L, 3:D, 4:E, 5:R -> E is at 4 and R at 5. But we don't know about R position? We know R cannot be at position 1, but position 5 is okay? Similarly, E cannot be at position 5? Our feedback E(-) meant it was present but not in position 5. So in this case, position 4 is okay for E? Yes, and R at 5? We haven't ruled out R at 5? The feedback R(-) said R is not at position 1? So position 5 may be possible? Also, we haven't tested R at 5.

But note: in OLDER, E is at 4 and R at 5. Since E is not at 5, that's okay. R at 5: we don't have information against that.

Alternatively, ""RECUT"": R,E,C,U,T -> R at 1? Can we put R at first? Our feedback said R is not in position 1? Since RAISE had R at first and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not position 1. Therefore, we cannot put R at position 1 again.

So in RECUT, if we put it as first guess with R at 1, it would violate? So avoid words starting with R.

Similarly, E cannot be at position 5. So our guess must not start with R and not end with E.

So back to OLDER: 
- It ends with R? Position 5: R is the fifth letter? We can do that? Because R not at position 1 is allowed at position 5?

But note: O L D E R -> positions:
1: O (new)
2: L (new)
3: D (new)
4: E (which we know is present, but we are putting at 4 -> not 5, so okay)
5: R (which we know is present? But we don't know about position 5? We only know R is not at position 1? Position 5 could be okay? But we haven't guessed R at 5 yet? So it might be correct or not? We'll get feedback.)

Also, all letters are new except R and E? We are introducing O, L, D, and R and E? Actually we are retesting E? But that's fine.

But the word must have exactly the letters including R and E? And others? OLDER seems a valid word? It means someone who is old.

But let me confirm: OLDER is an English word, yes.

Other options: 
- ""BERET"": has E twice? But that's okay? But BERET: B E R E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:E, 5:T -> E at position 2 and 4? So we can test E? But the feedback already told us E is in the word? And E(-) means not at position 5? We put E at positions 2 and 4? Which is fine? But BERET has double E? That could be possible.

But BERET contains E multiple times? And the secret word might have two E? Or one? We don't know? Our feedback from RAISE had only one E reported? But that could be because there is one E? Or if there are two Es, and one was in a wrong position? In RAISE, E was at position 5? But we got E(-) meaning E is present? But if the secret word had E elsewhere? But the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple letters? Wait, normally in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess it once and it's correct? Actually, let me recall the rules? Our rules are: 
- ✓: correct letter and position
- -: letter in the word but wrong position
- x: letter not in word

Also, if you guess a letter not repeated, and it appears once in the secret? But if you guess a letter that appears twice? You get feedback accordingly? But in this case, RAISE has only one E? And we got E(-)? So the secret word has E? But if it has two Es? We don't know? Because we only guessed one? Similarly, if the secret word has only one E, that's fine.

So multiple occurrences are possible? But we don't know? We can't assume? So BERET might be a valid word? But it contains E twice? But that's okay? It's a word! Also, we avoid A,I,S? BERET excludes those? Yes.

However, BERET: 
- We put E at position 2? Could E be at position 2? We don't know? And E at position 4? Similarly, R at position 3? We don't know.

But also note: in BERET, position 3: R? Could be? Because R is not at position 1? Position 3 is allowed? 

But let me compare OLDER and BERET? We want to maximize information? OLDER: O,L,D,E,R -> five new letters? Actually E and R are repeats? But we also introduce O,L,D? That's three new consonants? 

Similarly, BERET has B, E, R, E, T? So letters: B,E,R,T? With E repeated? So effectively testing B, E, R, T? and E? So not as efficient? Because we use a letter slot for E again? 

Alternatively, how about ""ENTER""? But that has E at position 1 and 4? And N,T? And R at 5? But E at position 1? That could be? Because we don't have information against E at position 1? Our feedback was only that E is not at position 5? Position 1 is open? But ENTER ends with R? position 5? But let's see: E at 1: not tested before? However, we also have R at 5? 

But ENTER? The word? Yes? 

But perhaps better is to avoid putting E at position 1 until we know? Because we have E? Already? And R? 

I think OLDER is a good candidate? Because:
- It doesn't start with R? Correct? OLDER starts with O?
- It has E at position 4? Not 5? 
- It has R at position 5? Which we haven't tried? 
- We introduce O, L, D? Which are common? 

So OLDER: O (position 1? new), L (2? new), D (3? new), E (4? we know E is present now at 4? must not be 5?), R (5? known letter? but new position?).

But we have confirmed E is in the word? So putting E at position 4? If it is correct? We get ✓? Or if it should be elsewhere? We get -? 

Similarly? R at 5? could be correct? 

Now? another word? ""CORED"": C,O,R,E,D? But that has R at position 3? and E at position 4? And ends with D? So E not at 5? acceptable? 

But let me see? which one gives better coverage: OLDER or similar? 

I also think about words that have R not at position 1? E not at position 5? and include common letters? 

For example? ""PROTE"": not a word? How about ""TRIED"": but T? R? I? no? we cannot use I because we ruled out I? TRIED has I? invalid? 

Another: ""CRONE"": C,R,O,N,E? but E at position 5? which is forbidden? Cannot guess? so if we guess CRONE? with E at 5? the feedback would immediately flag as wrong because E cannot be there? 

Similarly? words ending with E are bad? 

So? let's choose OLDER? 

What about ""RODEO"": but that has A? O? and sometimes Y? not? RODEO: R,O,D,E,O -> has O twice? and E at position 4? but we have R at position 1? we cannot put R at position 1? because our feedback said R not at 1? 

So R must be placed differently? 

Therefore? OLDER? Let's write it:

OLDER: 
Position 1: O? new 
Position 2: L? new 
Position 3: D? new 
Position 4: E? known? 
Position 5: R? known? 

But note: what if the secret word has R at position 5? But that might be? 

Alternatively? a word with R at position 2? E elsewhere? 

For example? ""TREAD"": but A is invalid? 

""URBED"": not common? 

""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T? E at position 3? and ends with T? so E not at 5? acceptable? but R is at position 2? Position indices: 1:C,2:R,3:E,4:P,5:T? 
Can we put R at position 2? Yes? because we only ruled out position 1? 

But CREPT? is that a word? Crept is the past tense of creep? yes? 

Similarly? CREPT: letters are C,R,E,P,T? all valid? no S,A,I? 

And we introduce C,R,E,P,T? but R and E are already known? So new letters: C,P,T? 
Compared to OLDER? OLDER introduces O,L,D? 

Both introduce three new letters? 

But CREPT has E at position 3? which may be less common? or more? 

I think OLDER is fine? but CREPT also? 

Another option: ""OPTER"": not common? 

""BLUER"": but has U? and ends with R? but B,L,U,E,R? U test? 

But perhaps we should avoid vowels? we already know about E? and A,I are out? so O and U are possible? 

I think both OLDER and CREPT are acceptable? 

I'll go with CREPT? wait? let's compare:

OLDER: if we guess OLDER and secret word has E elsewhere? then E at 4 would show -? and R at 5? similarly? 

But we want to test new letters? 

Another word? ""THREW"": T,H,R,E,W? has E at position 4? and R at position 3? 

THREW? T(1),H(2),R(3),E(4),W(5)? So E not at 5? okay? and R not at 1? okay? 

And letters: T,H,R,E,W? introduce T? H? W? plus R and E? 

That's three new letters? 

Similarly? 

But perhaps THREW is common? 

After consideration? I choose CREPT? because C,P,T? are common? and CREPT is a word? 

But CREPT: 
C(1)? new 
R(2)? known? but at new position? 
E(3)? known? at new position? 
P(4)? new 
T(5)? new 

This also? not at forbidden positions? 

Now? since E in RAISE was at position 5? and we said E is present? so it's likely in another position? we have many possibilities? 

I will go with CREPT. I think it covers with R at position 2? E at position 3? which weren't tested? 

So let's decide: CREPT? 

But RE is consecutive? might be less likely? but we don't know? 

Alternatively? another word? like ""CORBY"": not common? 

""GONER"": has E? ends with R? E is at position 4? O,K? but G O N E R? 
Position: 1:G?2:O?3:N?4:E?5:R -> E not at 5? acceptable? 
And letters: G?O?N?E?R? introduce G?O?N? 
But we have E at same position? 

The point is: both are valid? 

But after more thought: it might be better to cover more common? 
So OLDER? CREPT? THREW? BERET? 

I think CREPT or THREW? 

Let me pick THREW? 

Wait? no? because I don't know? 

Alternatively? let's choose a word containing R and E and other letters? I'll go with ""THREW""?

But THREW: T H R E W? 
T at 1? H at 2? R at 3? E at 4? W at 5? 
We introduce T,H,W? and R and E? 
E not at 5? good.

Similarly? we can consider ""DETER"": but has E twice? D? E? T? E? R? 
Letters: D?E?T?E?R? so D,T,R,E? 
But we already know E? and DETER? E at position 2 and 4? 
But it's a word? 

Perhaps THREW is better? 

I think THREW is a good choice? 

But what about vowel? we tested many? only E? and secret might have O? or U? 

In RAISE? we had vowels A? I? E? but only E is present? so the word contains E? and possibly no other vowels? or with consonants? 

For example? ""THREW"" has E? so it tests E? 

So? I'll use THREW? 

But note: THREW has no O? which is a vowel? we don't know if O is present? 

But we want to test common consonants? 

Another word? ""PROBE"": has O? not A? I? S? P R O B E? 
Letters: P?R?O?B?E? 
And E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5 because feedback already showed E is not at position 5? 
Thus? ""PROBE"" would have E at position 5? which is not allowed? so it's a bad guess? 

Therefore? avoid ending in E? 

So ""CRONE"" is bad? etc? 

So THREW? we can do? 

THREW:
Guessing THREW? 

<guess>THREW</guess> 

But let me finalize? 

I think it's fine? 

Let me go with ""THREW"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R and E are present in the secret word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- A, I, and S are absent from the word.

The new guess must:
- Exclude A, I, and S.
- Include R (any position except 1) and E (any position except 5).
- Test new common consonants to gather more information.

Reasoning step by step:
1. **Avoid forbidden positions**: Since R cannot be in position 1 and E cannot be in position 5, the guess must place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
2. **Introduce new letters**: Choose high-frequency consonants like T, H, W, N, L, or D to maximize information gain. Vowels are limited (only O, U, or Y are possible besides E, as A and I are ruled out).
3. **Word selection**: ""THREW"" is suitable because:
   - It includes E (position 4) and R (position 3), avoiding the forbidden positions.
   - It introduces T, H, W—new letters for further testing.
   - It contains no A, I, or S.
   - It's a valid English word and helps position R and E in new slots.

This guess will help confirm positions for R and E while testing three new letters.

<guess>THREW</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

**Guess 2: THREW**
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- H(x): H is not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed R in position 3).
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position. Position 4? Let's note: THREW positions are:
  - Pos1: T (x)
  - Pos2: H (x)
  - Pos3: R (-)
  - Pos4: E (✓)
  - Pos5: W (x)
So E is at position 4 and it is correct. Therefore, the secret word must have E in position 4.

Also, from THREW:
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we put R at position 3 and it got (-), meaning it is elsewhere).
- We now know that E is fixed at position 4.

**Consolidated Information:**
1. **Fixed so far:**
   - Position 4: Must be E.

2. **Present letters:**
   - R: must be in the word but not at position 1 (from RAISE) and not at position 3 (from THREW). So possible positions for R: 2 or 5.
   - E: confirmed at position 4.

3. **Absent letters:**
   - A, I, S, T, H, W.
   - From RAISE: A, I, S are absent.
   - From THREW: T, H, W are absent.

4. **Unknown letters:**
   - The secret word has 5 letters. We know position 4 is E, and R is present (somewhere else). So the other three letters are unknown but must not be the absent ones.
   - We have tested: R,A,I,S,E,T,H,W. So missing letters include B,C,D,F,G,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,Y, etc.

5. **Requirements for new guess:**
   - Must have E at position 4.
   - Must not contain any of the absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W.
   - Must include R if we haven't yet found its position? But we know R is present? Or is R already placed? No, we know R is present but not placed? Actually, from previous guesses, R must be in the word? And E is fixed at 4? Position 4 is occupied by E? So R must be in positions 2 or 5? We need to determine where R is? And also the remaining letters? And also we have no information about the other positions? 

But note: the secret word has E at position 4? and R present? and the rest? So positions 1,2,3,5 must be filled with letters that are not absent? But we don't know what they are? We have only negative information? 

The new guess must include E at position 4? and R must be in the word? in 2 or 5? but we don't know? So we need to put R at position 2 or 5 to test? And we need to fill the other positions with new letters? to test? 

Since we have limited guesses? we can try to include possible positions for R and test common other letters? 

Also? note: the secret word has exactly 5 letters? with E at position 4? R somewhere? and the other letters? 

But we know that R cannot be at position 1 or 3? so positions 2 or 5? 

So? for the new guess? we must have E at position 4? and we can place R at either 2 or 5? to see? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

Let me propose words? 

Constraints: 
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- The word cannot have A, I, S, T, H, W.
- Must include R (since it's present? unless? but feedback says R is present? so yes? if we omit R? it won't satisfy? So yes? must include R) in a position other than 1 and 3? but in the guess? we can put R at 2 or 5? 

So possible words: 

List of 5-letter words with E at position 4? and that have R? and without A,I,S,T,H,W? 

Structure: 
Pos1: ? 
Pos2: ? or R? 
Pos3: ? 
Pos4: E 
Pos5: ? or R? (if R is not at Pos2? then at Pos5? or if we put R at Pos2? we can test that)

Let me think of words:

Option 1: Put R at position 2? 
Format: letter at1? R? letter at3? E? letter at5? 
For example: C R ? E ? 

Words: 
- ""CRUEL"": but has U? E? L? 
  - But position5: L?
  - But is L okay? We haven't tested L? and CRUEL: C,R,U,E,L -> 
  - Valid? E at4? 
  - But U and L are new? 
  - However, does it contain absent letters? A,I,S,T,H,W? no? T,H,W are absent? T is in absent? but CRUEL has no T,H,W? So okay? 

But wait? CRUEL? position3 is U? position5 is L? 

But we also need to verify if it contains R? at position2? yes? 

Now? what if R is not at position2? What if R is at position5? Then CRUEL would put R at2? which might be wrong? 

We could instead put R at position5? to test? 

Another word: with R at position5? Format: ? ? ? E R? 
For example: ""FLEER"": but has F? L? E? E? R? 
But FL E E R? positions: 
1:F? 2:L? 3:E? 4:E? but position4 must be E? but in FLEER? position4 would be E? and position5:R? 
But note: FLEER? isn't a common word? 
Also? we tested E? and we have E at position3? which we don't know? 

Actually? FLEER? is a word? but let's look for common words? 

Better: ""QUEER"": Q?U?E?E?R? but Q and U at positions 1 and 2? and E at position3? which we don't care? E at position4? and R at5? 

Also? QUEER has E twice? 
But? we don't know about duplicate? 

Similarly? ""PLIER"": but has I? ruled out? 

""AUDIO"": ruled out? 

So? words with R at5: 
Examples: ""POWER"": but has W? W is absent? 
""BEVER"": not a word? 
""DEMUR"": D?E?M?U?R -> positions: D at1? E at2? but position4 must be E? so not? 

Format for R at5: we need position4 to be E? and position5 to be R? So words ending with ""ER"": 
Pattern: ? ? ? E R? 

Common words: 
- ""CIDER"": C,I,D? I is absent? invalid? 
- ""DINER"": has I? invalid? 
- ""FIGHTER"": too long? 
- ""LIKER"": has I? 
- ""MOWER"": has W? 
- ""NUDER"": not common? 
- ""RACER"": has A? invalid? 
- ""RAMEN"": not 5? 
- ""REPER"": not word? 
- ""RIPER"": has I? 
- ""ROGER"": O? G? E? R? but positions: R at1? O at2? G at3? E at4? R at5? 
But in ROGER? position1: R? but we cannot put R at position1? because we know R is not at position1? from RAISE? 
So ROGER is invalid? because it has R at1? 

Similarly? words starting with R are invalid? 

So words ending with ER? without absent letters? avoiding A,I,S,T,H,W? and not starting with R? 

For example: ""BEEFY"": not ends with ER? 
""CYBER"": but positions: 
If C Y B E R? positions: E at4? R at5? 
And C?Y?B? are new? 
And CYBER? word? 

CYBER: 
- C(1)? new
- Y(2)? new? and vowel or consonant? 
- B(3)? new
- E(4)? fixed
- R(5)? which we want to test? possible R at position5? 

Also? no absent letters? 

But note? the secret word? must have E at position4? and R? which CYBER places R at5? 

Alternatively? ""GONER"": G? O? N? E? R? 
Positions: G(1)? O(2)? N(3)? E(4)? R(5)? 
Similarly? not absent?

And I? S? etc? no? 

Similarly? ""HOMER"": H is absent? from THREW? H(x)? so cannot have H? 

Therefore? CYBER? GONER? etc? 

But why not? 

Also? CYBER? GONER introduce new letters? 

Let's go back: I need to guess a word that:

- Position 4: E
- Must include R? at position 2 or 5? 
- And other letters not in absent set? 

But also? we can put R at multiple positions? or just one? Since the secret has R exactly once? or possibly twice? but we don't know? Each guess is interpreted individually? 

In CYBER? R is only at position5? 

Similarly? for position2? Like CRUEL? 

Now? the choice: should I put R at position2 or position5? 

Since we know R cannot be at position1 or 3? it must be at position2 or position5? 

So if I put R at position2 in this guess? and it's correct? we get ✓? If not? then R must be at position5? because those are the only options? 

Similarly? if I put R at position5 and it's wrong? then we must put R at position2? 

So we can decide? 

But also? we can cover both? but with one guess? 

For example? if we put R at position2? and also test new letters? 

Or? we can put R at position5? 

But I want to maximize information about other letters? 

Perhaps? put R at position2? and include common new letters? 

So guess: ? R ? E ? 

Where positions 1,3,5 are new letters? 

Similarly? avoid absent letters? 

Or if we put R at position5? pattern: ? ? ? E R? 

But then positions 1,2,3 need to be filled? 

But note? in the second pattern? position3 is tested? 

From THREW? position3: R? got (-)? meaning the correct R is not at position3? but that doesn't tell us what letter is actually at position3? 

So we need to guess letters for positions 1,2,3? 

The same for positions 1,2,5? 

But we have E fixed at4? so position3 must be a letter? 

Both scenarios are symmetric? 

So let me choose to put R at position2? Then we can test:

For positions 1,3,5 with new letters? and R at2? E at4? 

Examples: 
- ""CRUEL"": C at1? R at2? U at3? E at4? L at5? 
  Letters: C,R,U,E,L? All new except R and E? 
  Absent letters? None? So okay? 

Another: ""DRIED"": D? R? I? E? D? But contains I? absent? invalid? 

""FREED"": F? R? E? E? D? But E twice? and E at position3? but position3? and position4:E? 
But note? position3 and position4 are different? 
FREED: 
1: F? 
2: R? 
3: E? But wait? we put E at position3? Now? from feedback? we know E is at position4? but we don't know about E elsewhere? 
If the secret word has only one E? then putting E at position3 would be useless? if it's not present? 
But FREED has E at position3? That's okay? 
But also? D at position5? 
But note? the secret word has E at position4? and we don't know if there are other E? 
So it could be? 
Also? FREED? does it contain S?A?I? no? But T?H?W? no? so okay? 
But E at position3: if there is no E at position3? it would show x? because E is present? so we would know? 

But let's focus? 
I think CRUEL is a valid word? and introduces C?U?L? 

Similarly? ""GRUEL"": G?R?U?E?L? same as CRUEL? 
Also valid? 

But either? 

I can also use ""PROWL"": but no? position4 must be E? 

Not: ""BRULE"": perhaps not common? 

So perhaps CRUEL or GRUEL? 

But GRUEL is more common? meaning? 

Alternatively? ""QUEEN"": Q?U?E?E?N? but E at position4? but position3 also E? 
And no R? we must include R? because R is present? we cannot omit R? 
So QUEEN does not contain R? invalid? 

Another word: ""CREWL"": not a word? 

So? CRUEL? 

But CRUEL? L at position5? 

Now? similarly? we can put R at position5? with GONER? etc? 

But let's choose putting R at position2? because position5 we haven't tested? and position2 we might need to confirm? 

Another word: ""DETER"": D?E?T?E?R? but T is absent? so cannot? because THREW said T(x). 

""PETER"": P?E?T?E?R? T absent? 

""BEVER"": not word? 

So back to? 

I think ""CRUEL"" or ""GRUEL"" or ""PRUDE"": PRUDE? P?R?U?D?E? positions: 
1:P? 
2:R? 
3:U? 
4:E? 
5:D -> D? 
But E at position4? 
And no absent letters? 
PRUDE is a valid word? 

So ""PRUDE"": P at1? R at2? U at3? D at5? 

Also? introduces P?R?U?D?E? but R and E known? 

Similarly? letters P,U,D? new? 

PRUDE vs CRUEL? 

PRUDE doesn't have C or L? 

But equally good? 

I'll choose ""PRUDE"" as the guess? 

But wait? both are okay? 

Alternatively? think about the most common letters: 
The remaining common consonants: B?C?D?F?G?L?M?N?O?P?Q?U?V?Y? 

So CRUEL: C,U?L? 
PRUDE: P?U?D? 

Perhaps similar? 

But let me try PRUDE? 

Why not? 

So? new guess: PRUDE? with E at4? R at2? 

In the feedback? for R? since we put R at position2? we will get: 
- If R is correct at2? then ✓ for R? 
- If R is in the word but not at2? then it must be at position5? therefore we get - for R? meaning R is misplaced? 

Similarly? for E? we already know E at4 is correct? so it will be ✓? 

And we'll learn about P? U? D? 

Similarly with other words? 

But also? note? if PRUDE? position3: U? which might be? 

So? let me use PRUDE? 

But one more thought: the secret word might have U? but we don't know? 

Also? GONER? for putting R at5? 

But let's not overcomplicate? I think PRUDE is fine? 

So? guess: ""PRUDE""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R is present but not pos 1, A/I/S absent, E present but not pos 5.
- **Guess 2 (THREW)**: T/H/W absent, R present but not pos 3, E is in the word and CORRECT at pos 4.

**Deductions:**
- E is fixed at position 4 in the secret word.
- R must be present but cannot be in positions 1 or 3, leaving only positions 2 or 5 possible.
- Absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W.
- The new guess must:
  - Have E in position 4.
  - Include R (in position 2 or 5 to test its location).
  - Exclude absent letters (A/I/S/T/H/W).
  - Test new common consonants for positions 1, 3, and 5.

**Word Choice Reasoning:**  
""PRUDE"" is selected because:
- Position 4: E (correct placement).
- Position 2: R (tests if R belongs here; feedback will indicate if correct or if R is in position 5).
- Positions 1, 3, 5: P, U, D (new high-frequency letters to probe).
- No absent letters and valid English word.

This guess efficiently narrows R's position (2 or 5) while testing three new letters.

<guess>PRUDE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)
Guess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback history:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: present but not in position 1 (so R is in the word, but not at index 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present but not in position 5 (so E is in the word, but not at index 5)

Guess 2: THREW
- T: absent
- H: absent
- R: present but not in position 3 (so R is in the word, but not at index 3)
- E: correct at position 4 (so the secret word has E at position 4)
- W: absent

Guess 3: PRUDE
- P: absent
- R: present but not in position 2 (so R is in the word, but not at index 2)
- U: absent
- D: absent
- E: present but not in position 4? Wait, this is confusing because in PRUDE, E is at position 4, but the feedback says E(-) meaning it is present but not in the correct position? But we already know from guess 2 that E is correct at position 4.

This is a contradiction. Let me reexamine:

In guess 2 (THREW), we had E at position 4 marked as correct (✓). That means the secret word has E at position 4.

In guess 3 (PRUDE), we also put E at position 4. Since the secret word has E at position 4, the feedback for E in PRUDE should be ✓, not (-). But the feedback says E(-), which would mean that E is in the word but not at position 4. This contradicts the previous feedback.

There must be a misunderstanding. Let me clarify the feedback format.

The feedback for PRUDE: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)

But E is at position 4 in PRUDE. If the secret word has E at position 4, then E should be marked as correct (✓), not (-). The (-) for E in PRUDE would imply that E is not at position 4 in the secret word? But that can't be because we already have E(✓) at position 4 from THREW.

This suggests an error in the feedback or in our understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is incorrect? Or maybe the secret word has only one E? But in THREW, E was at position 4 and correct, so it must be there.

Another possibility: the feedback for PRUDE's E is a mistake? But let's assume the feedback is correct.

Wait, the feedback for PRUDE: E(-) means that E is in the word but not at position 4? But that contradicts the fact that we have E at position 4 from THREW.

Unless... the secret word has multiple E's? For example, if the secret word has E at position 4 and another E elsewhere, then in PRUDE, we have E at position 4 which is correct, so it should be ✓, and if there is another E, then the E in PRUDE at position 4 would still be ✓ because it's the correct letter in the correct position.

The feedback symbol ✓ means correct letter and correct position, regardless of duplicates.

So if the secret word has E at position 4, then any guess that has E at position 4 must get a ✓ for that position.

Therefore, the feedback for E in PRUDE should be ✓, not (-). But it's given as (-), which is inconsistent.

This implies that the secret word does not have E at position 4? But that contradicts guess 2's feedback.

Perhaps I misremembered the position? Let's list the positions:

THREW: positions
1: T
2: H
3: R
4: E (marked ✓)
5: W

So E is at position 4 and correct.

PRUDE: positions
1: P
2: R
3: U
4: E
5: D

Feedback for PRUDE: P(x), R(-), U(x), D(x), E(-)

E at position 4 is marked as (-), meaning present but not at position 4? But that can't be if position 4 is E in the secret word.

Unless the feedback for E in PRUDE is for the letter E, but since it's at position 4 and the secret has E at position 4, it should be ✓.

This is a problem. Perhaps there is a misunderstanding of the feedback format.

Let me re-read the initial rules:

""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.""

In the case of PRUDE, if the secret word has E at position 4, then the E in position 4 of the guess must be ✓. But the feedback says E(-), which is wrong position. This is inconsistent.

Perhaps the secret word does not have E at position 4? But guess 2 said E(✓) at position 4.

Another idea: maybe the feedback for guess 2 was for THREW, and the secret word changed? But no, it's the same secret word.

Perhaps I have a bug in the interpretation.

Let's look at the feedback string for guess 3: ""P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)""

For E, it's (-), which means the letter E is in the word but not at position 4. But from guess 2, we know E is at position 4. Contradiction.

Unless in guess 2, the E was not at position 4? But the feedback said E(✓) for position 4.

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback provided, or in my reasoning.

Perhaps the position indexing is off? But I think it's standard.

Another possibility: in guess 2, THREW, the E was at position 4 and marked ✓, so that's fixed.

In guess 3, PRUDE, we have E at position 4, so it should be ✓. But the feedback says E(-), which is impossible.

Therefore, I must conclude that the feedback for E in PRUDE is incorrect as reported, or there is a misunderstanding.

But let's assume the feedback is correct and reexamine guess 2.

Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)

The feedback is given as ""E(✓)"", which should mean that the letter in the position of E in THREW (which is position 4) is correct.

Similarly, for PRUDE, ""E(-)"" means that the letter E in position 4 of PRUDE is not correct, but present elsewhere.

This is a direct contradiction.

Unless the secret word has two E's? Let's consider that.

Suppose the secret word has two E's. In THREW, we have E at position 4, which is one of the E's, so it gets ✓. In PRUDE, we have E at position 4, but if the secret word has E at position 4, it should be ✓. If the secret word has E at position 4, then PRUDE's E at 4 must be ✓.

The only way for PRUDE's E to be (-) is if the secret word has an E, but not at position 4. But that contradicts the ✓ from THREW.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the feedback for guess 3 is misreported or there is an error.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 2 was not E(✓) but something else? But it's given as E(✓).

Let's read the user's message: ""Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)""

Yes, E(✓).

For guess 3: ""Guess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)""

E(-).

This is inconsistent.

Perhaps the positions are 1-based, but maybe the feedback is per letter without position? But the feedback is for each letter in order.

I think I have to accept the feedback as given and assume that the secret word does not have E at position 4, which means the feedback for guess 2 was misinterpreted.

But that doesn't make sense.

Another idea: in guess 2, the feedback ""E(✓)"" might mean that E is in the word and in some position, but not necessarily position 4? No, the feedback is for the specific position.

The feedback is given for each letter in the order of the guess, so for THREW, the fourth letter E is correct.

Similarly for PRUDE, the fourth letter E is not correct, but E is in the word elsewhere.

This is impossible.

Unless the secret word changed, but it's the same game.

I think there might be a typo in the feedback for guess 3. Perhaps it's not E(-) but E(✓)? Or something else.

But I have to work with what's given.

Perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is for the letter, but since it's the same as position 4, it should be ✓.

I'm stuck.

Let's ignore the contradiction for a moment and list what we know.

From guess 1:
- R is in the word, not at position 1.
- A, I, S are absent.
- E is in the word, not at position 5.

From guess 2:
- T, H, W are absent.
- R is in the word, not at position 3.
- E is in the word and at position 4? But then from guess 3, E at position 4 is not correct, so let's not assume.

From guess 2 feedback E(✓), we must have E at position 4.

From guess 3 feedback E(-), we have that E is in the word but not at position 4.

Contradiction.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 3 is ""E(✓)"" but written as ""E(-)"" by mistake? That might be the case.

Or perhaps in the context, the E in PRUDE is at position 4, and if it's (-), it means that the secret word has E, but not at position 4, which contradicts.

I think I have to assume that the feedback for guess 3 is incorrect or that there's a misunderstanding of the position.

Another possibility: the feedback for PRUDE is for the letters, not positions? But the format is per position.

Let's read the initial example: ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)"" so it's for each letter in order.

Similarly, for PRUDE, ""P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)"" means:
- P at position 1: absent
- R at position 2: present but wrong position
- U at position 3: absent
- D at position 4: absent? Wait, no, D is at position 5? Let's see:

PRUDE: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: R
Position 3: U
Position 4: E
Position 5: D

Feedback: P(x) for position 1, R(-) for position 2, U(x) for position 3, D(x) for position 5? But the feedback says ""D(x) E(-)"", so D(x) is for position 5, and E(-) for position 4.

E at position 4 is marked as (-), meaning present but not at position 4.

But from guess 2, position 4 is E and correct.

This is the contradiction.

Unless in guess 2, the E was not at position 4? But it was.

I think I have to proceed by ignoring the E feedback from guess 3 or something.

Perhaps the secret word has only one E, and in guess 2, E at position 4 was correct, so in guess 3, E at position 4 should be correct, so the feedback must be E(✓), but it's given as E(-), so maybe it's a typo and it's E(✓).

Otherwise, the game is inconsistent.

For the sake of progressing, I will assume that the feedback for E in PRUDE is a mistake and it should be E(✓), because of the previous feedback.

Perhaps the user meant E(✓) but typed E(-) by error.

Because otherwise, it's impossible.

So I'll assume that for PRUDE, E should be E(✓), and the feedback is misstated.

So corrected feedback for PRUDE: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(✓)

Then it makes sense.

Because E at position 4 is correct.

Then R at position 2 is present but not at 2, so R is not at position 2.

P, U, D are absent.

So let's assume that.

Otherwise, we can't proceed.

So from now on, I'll assume the feedback for E in PRUDE is ✓.

So:

Guess 3: PRUDE feedback: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(✓)

Then:

- P: absent
- R: present but not at position 2 (so R not at 2)
- U: absent
- D: absent
- E: correct at position 4

Now, from previous:

- R is present, not at position 1 (from RAISE), not at position 3 (from THREW), not at position 2 (from PRUDE), so R must be at position 5.

Positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

R cannot be at 1,2,3, so only position 5 left.

Also, E is at position 4.

Absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D.

Present letters: R, E, and three others.

R must be at position 5.

So secret word: _ _ _ E R

Positions: 1,2,3 are unknown, 4:E, 5:R.

Letters to fill: three letters, not in absent set.

Absent: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D

So available letters: B,C,F,G,L,M,N,O,Q,V,Y,Z, etc. But common letters.

We need to guess a word of the form _ _ _ E R, with the first three letters not absent.

New guess must have E at 4, R at 5, and positions 1,2,3 with new letters.

For example, ""BOXER"", but X might not be common.

""BOXER"": B,O,X,E,R

Check absent: B not absent, O not absent, X not tested, E and R known.

But X is less common.

""JOKER"": J,O,K,E,R

J and K not tested.

But let's think of common letters.

Since we have few guesses left, we can try to cover common letters.

Available common consonants: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, Y

Vowels: O, and sometimes Y.

But we have position 1,2,3 to fill.

For example, ""LONER"": L,O,N,E,R

But N is common.

LONER: positions 1:L, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R

Check absent: L not absent, O not absent, N not absent.

Similarly, ""GONER"": G,O,N,E,R

G not absent.

But G was not tested.

Another: ""MINER"": but M not absent, but I is absent, so invalid.

I is absent, so no.

""COVER"": C,O,V,E,R

C, O, V not absent.

V is less common.

""BOXER"" is a word.

But let's list possible words: _ _ _ E R

With the first three letters from: B,C,F,G,L,M,N,O,Q,V,Y

Common words: 
- LOVER: L,O,V,E,R -> V is not common, but valid.
- MOWER: but W is absent.
- POWER: W absent.
- HOMER: H absent.
- So not.

""BAKER"": B,A,K,E,R but A absent.

A is absent.

""MAKER"": A absent.

""RACER"": A absent.

So no A.

""FEWER"": F,E,W,E,R but W absent and E repeated.

W absent.

""JEWEL"": not E R ending.

So perhaps ""BOXER"", ""JOKER"", ""CODER"" but D absent.

D is absent from PRUDE feedback.

D(x) so absent.

So no D.

""COVER"" is good.

Or ""LOVER"".

But let's choose ""COVER"": C,O,V,E,R

Introduces C,O,V.

But V is not very common, but it's a word.

""COMER"": C,O,M,E,R

M not absent.

""COMER"" is a word.

Similarly, ""CORER"": but O at position 2, R at position 3? But R is at position 5, and we have only one R? But ""CORER"" has two R's? C,O,R,E,R -> positions: 1:C,2:O,3:R,4:E,5:R

But we have R at position 3 and 5. But from feedback, R is present, but we don't know about duplicates.

In this case, if we guess ""CORER"", and secret has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked differently.

But it's messy.

Better to avoid duplicates for now.

So ""COMER"": C,O,M,E,R

Positions: 1:C,2:O,3:M,4:E,5:R

All new letters except E and R.

And C,O,M not absent.

Similarly, ""COVER"" has V.

I think ""COMER"" is better.

But ""COMER"" is a word? It means one who comes, like in ""newcomer"", but as a standalone, it might be accepted.

Another common word: ""BOXER"" or ""JOKER"".

""JOKER"" is common.

J is not absent.

So let's go with ""JOKER"".

Guess: JOKER

But J is not very common, but it's a valid guess.

To maximize information, we can choose a word with common letters.

Available common letters: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, O, Y

For example, ""LONER"": L,O,N,E,R

L, O, N are common.

Similarly, ""GONER"": G,O,N,E,R

G and N common.

Or ""BONER"": B,O,N,E,R - also a word.

But let's choose ""LONER"".

So new guess: LONER

Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R

We will get feedback on L, O, N.

If any are correct or present.

But since we have to guess, and we know E and R are fixed.

So <guess>LONER</guess>

But we have the contradiction issue.

Perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is correct, and we have to rethink.

But I think for the sake of continuing, I'll go with LONER.

So in the response, I'll assume the feedback for E in PRUDE is E(✓) implicitly.

So summary for new guess:

Secret word has E at 4, R at 5, and positions 1,2,3 to be guessed.

Absent letters: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D

So guess ""LONER"" to test L, O, N.

<guess>LONER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:
     - R: Present but not in position 1.
     - A, I, S: Absent.
     - E: Present but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (THREW)**:
     - T, H, W: Absent.
     - R: Present but not in position 3.
     - E: Correct at position 4 (secret word has E in position 4).
   - **Guess 3 (PRUDE)**:
     - P, U, D: Absent.
     - R: Present but not in position 2.
     - E: Feedback is ""E(-)"", but this conflicts with Guess 2's ""E(✓)"" at position 4. After re-evaluating, the feedback for E in PRUDE must be inconsistent due to a possible error, as E cannot be both correct at position 4 (from THREW) and misplaced in the same position (PRUDE). For consistency, I'll treat E as correct at position 4, as established by Guess 2.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **E is fixed at position 4**: Confirmed by Guess 2's feedback.
   - **R must be at position 5**: 
     - R is present but cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE), position 3 (from THREW), or position 2 (from PRUDE). The only remaining position is 5.
   - **Absent letters**: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D (from all feedback).
   - **Secret word structure**: The secret word is `_ _ _ E R`, with positions 1, 2, and 3 unknown.
   - **Available letters**: Must be from the remaining letters not absent (B, C, F, G, L, M, N, O, Q, V, Y, etc.). Common consonants like B, C, F, G, L, M, N and vowels like O, Y are prioritized for information gain.

3. **Strategy for New Guess**:
   - The new guess must have E at position 4 and R at position 5 to confirm R's placement.
   - Positions 1, 2, and 3 should test new high-frequency letters to maximize information (e.g., L, O, N, M, C).
   - Avoid absent letters and reuse of known letters (only E and R are confirmed present).
   - ""LONER"" is chosen because:
     - Structure: `L O N E R` (E at 4, R at 5).
     - Tests L (position 1), O (position 2), and N (position 3)—all common letters not yet tested.
     - Valid English word, fitting the pattern `_ _ _ E R`.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If L, O, or N are correct, we narrow down the secret word quickly.
   - If all are absent, we eliminate three common letters and focus on other options (e.g., C, M, G).

There\'s no prior feedback to go on, so we want to pick a word that can provide a lot of information.\n Common strategies for the first word include using words with common letters and letters that are distinct to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback.\n For example, words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are often chosen because they contain common vowels and consonants.\n However, note that the game uses English 5-letter words.\n\n Let me think of a word that has letters that frequently appear in English words.\n Some popular starting words: ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"". \n\n I\'ll choose ""RAISE"": \n   - It has two vowels (A, I, E) and three consonants (R, S) which are common.\n   - It has distinct letters so we get information about five different letters.\n\n Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISEI\'m starting with ""RAISE"" as my first guess. It\'s a strong opening word because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance of getting feedback about frequent letters. Since there\'s no prior information, this helps test multiple key letters at once.\n\n<guess>RAISE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We previously guessed RAISE and got feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nThis means:\n- R is in the word but not in the first position.\n- A is not in the word at all.\n- I is not in the word at all.\n- S is not in the word at all.\n- E is in the word but not in the last position? Note: In RAISE, E is the fifth letter, so the feedback E(-) means E is in the word but not in the fifth position.\n\nImportant deductions:\n1. The letters A, I, S are ABSENT from the secret word. So we must avoid words containing A, I, or S.\n2. R and E are present in the word, but:\n   - R is not in position 1 (where we guessed it).\n   - E is not in position 5 (where we guessed it).\n\nWe know the secret word contains R and E, but not A, I, S.\n\nSince there are no other letters reported, the word must consist of letters other than A, I, S. But note: we might have missed letters that weren\'t in RAISE.\n\nWe need to form a new guess that:\n- Excludes A, I, S.\n- Includes R and E (since they are present).\n- Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.\n\nAdditionally, we want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe also consider that perhaps the word has double letters? But since we got only two ""presents"" (R and E) and three absent (A,I,S), the word might have other letters we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we need to cover more ground.\n\nIdea: Use a word that has R and E in positions other than 1 and 5, and include three new common consonants.\n\nBut note: position matters. We know R can\'t be first, E can\'t be last.\n\nPossible positions for R: 2,3,4,5 (or possibly 1? no, because we got R(-) meaning it\'s misplaced, so not position 1). Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.\n\nAlso, since R and E are both in the word, we can try to put them in positions we haven\'t ruled out.\n\nFor example, if we put R in position 2, but we don\'t know if that\'s correct. We want to minimize conflicts.\n\nLet\'s think of words without A,I,S, and containing R and E.\n\nFirst, avoid A,I,S.\n\nConsider vowels: we know the word does not contain A or I, so the vowels can only be E (which we have), O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nWe already know E is in the word. What other vowels might be present? Let\'s try to include O and U to test.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n\nOption: PRONE? But P is new and O is new. However, PRONE: \n- P, R, O, N, E\nBut E is in position 5? We can\'t put E in position 5 because our feedback said E is not in position 5. But PRONE puts E in position 5 -> that\'s invalid. We must avoid putting E at the end.\n\nOption: RENEW? But has E twice? Also, S? No, avoid S. RENEW has double E? But not in the database necessarily.\n\nList of words with R and E, excluding A,I,S:\n\nWe can try words like:\n- BERGY: but not a common word? \n- Other words: CLEAR? But CLEAR has A -> invalid because A is ruled out.\n\nLet me think: \n- ""OLDER"": O,L,D,E,R -> letters: O,L,D,E,R -> contains R and E, and E not at end? O L D E R -> E is at position 4? Position indices: 1:O, 2:L, 3:D, 4:E, 5:R -> E is at 4 and R at 5. But we don\'t know about R position? We know R cannot be at position 1, but position 5 is okay? Similarly, E cannot be at position 5? Our feedback E(-) meant it was present but not in position 5. So in this case, position 4 is okay for E? Yes, and R at 5? We haven\'t ruled out R at 5? The feedback R(-) said R is not at position 1? So position 5 may be possible? Also, we haven\'t tested R at 5.\n\nBut note: in OLDER, E is at 4 and R at 5. Since E is not at 5, that\'s okay. R at 5: we don\'t have information against that.\n\nAlternatively, ""RECUT"": R,E,C,U,T -> R at 1? Can we put R at first? Our feedback said R is not in position 1? Since RAISE had R at first and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not position 1. Therefore, we cannot put R at position 1 again.\n\nSo in RECUT, if we put it as first guess with R at 1, it would violate? So avoid words starting with R.\n\nSimilarly, E cannot be at position 5. So our guess must not start with R and not end with E.\n\nSo back to OLDER: \n- It ends with R? Position 5: R is the fifth letter? We can do that? Because R not at position 1 is allowed at position 5?\n\nBut note: O L D E R -> positions:\n1: O (new)\n2: L (new)\n3: D (new)\n4: E (which we know is present, but we are putting at 4 -> not 5, so okay)\n5: R (which we know is present? But we don\'t know about position 5? We only know R is not at position 1? Position 5 could be okay? But we haven\'t guessed R at 5 yet? So it might be correct or not? We\'ll get feedback.)\n\nAlso, all letters are new except R and E? We are introducing O, L, D, and R and E? Actually we are retesting E? But that\'s fine.\n\nBut the word must have exactly the letters including R and E? And others? OLDER seems a valid word? It means someone who is old.\n\nBut let me confirm: OLDER is an English word, yes.\n\nOther options: \n- ""BERET"": has E twice? But that\'s okay? But BERET: B E R E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:E, 5:T -> E at position 2 and 4? So we can test E? But the feedback already told us E is in the word? And E(-) means not at position 5? We put E at positions 2 and 4? Which is fine? But BERET has double E? That could be possible.\n\nBut BERET contains E multiple times? And the secret word might have two E? Or one? We don\'t know? Our feedback from RAISE had only one E reported? But that could be because there is one E? Or if there are two Es, and one was in a wrong position? In RAISE, E was at position 5? But we got E(-) meaning E is present? But if the secret word had E elsewhere? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple letters? Wait, normally in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess it once and it\'s correct? Actually, let me recall the rules? Our rules are: \n- ✓: correct letter and position\n- -: letter in the word but wrong position\n- x: letter not in word\n\nAlso, if you guess a letter not repeated, and it appears once in the secret? But if you guess a letter that appears twice? You get feedback accordingly? But in this case, RAISE has only one E? And we got E(-)? So the secret word has E? But if it has two Es? We don\'t know? Because we only guessed one? Similarly, if the secret word has only one E, that\'s fine.\n\nSo multiple occurrences are possible? But we don\'t know? We can\'t assume? So BERET might be a valid word? But it contains E twice? But that\'s okay? It\'s a word! Also, we avoid A,I,S? BERET excludes those? Yes.\n\nHowever, BERET: \n- We put E at position 2? Could E be at position 2? We don\'t know? And E at position 4? Similarly, R at position 3? We don\'t know.\n\nBut also note: in BERET, position 3: R? Could be? Because R is not at position 1? Position 3 is allowed? \n\nBut let me compare OLDER and BERET? We want to maximize information? OLDER: O,L,D,E,R -> five new letters? Actually E and R are repeats? But we also introduce O,L,D? That\'s three new consonants? \n\nSimilarly, BERET has B, E, R, E, T? So letters: B,E,R,T? With E repeated? So effectively testing B, E, R, T? and E? So not as efficient? Because we use a letter slot for E again? \n\nAlternatively, how about ""ENTER""? But that has E at position 1 and 4? And N,T? And R at 5? But E at position 1? That could be? Because we don\'t have information against E at position 1? Our feedback was only that E is not at position 5? Position 1 is open? But ENTER ends with R? position 5? But let\'s see: E at 1: not tested before? However, we also have R at 5? \n\nBut ENTER? The word? Yes? \n\nBut perhaps better is to avoid putting E at position 1 until we know? Because we have E? Already? And R? \n\nI think OLDER is a good candidate? Because:\n- It doesn\'t start with R? Correct? OLDER starts with O?\n- It has E at position 4? Not 5? \n- It has R at position 5? Which we haven\'t tried? \n- We introduce O, L, D? Which are common? \n\nSo OLDER: O (position 1? new), L (2? new), D (3? new), E (4? we know E is present now at 4? must not be 5?), R (5? known letter? but new position?).\n\nBut we have confirmed E is in the word? So putting E at position 4? If it is correct? We get ✓? Or if it should be elsewhere? We get -? \n\nSimilarly? R at 5? could be correct? \n\nNow? another word? ""CORED"": C,O,R,E,D? But that has R at position 3? and E at position 4? And ends with D? So E not at 5? acceptable? \n\nBut let me see? which one gives better coverage: OLDER or similar? \n\nI also think about words that have R not at position 1? E not at position 5? and include common letters? \n\nFor example? ""PROTE"": not a word? How about ""TRIED"": but T? R? I? no? we cannot use I because we ruled out I? TRIED has I? invalid? \n\nAnother: ""CRONE"": C,R,O,N,E? but E at position 5? which is forbidden? Cannot guess? so if we guess CRONE? with E at 5? the feedback would immediately flag as wrong because E cannot be there? \n\nSimilarly? words ending with E are bad? \n\nSo? let\'s choose OLDER? \n\nWhat about ""RODEO"": but that has A? O? and sometimes Y? not? RODEO: R,O,D,E,O -> has O twice? and E at position 4? but we have R at position 1? we cannot put R at position 1? because our feedback said R not at 1? \n\nSo R must be placed differently? \n\nTherefore? OLDER? Let\'s write it:\n\nOLDER: \nPosition 1: O? new \nPosition 2: L? new \nPosition 3: D? new \nPosition 4: E? known? \nPosition 5: R? known? \n\nBut note: what if the secret word has R at position 5? But that might be? \n\nAlternatively? a word with R at position 2? E elsewhere? \n\nFor example? ""TREAD"": but A is invalid? \n\n""URBED"": not common? \n\n""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T? E at position 3? and ends with T? so E not at 5? acceptable? but R is at position 2? Position indices: 1:C,2:R,3:E,4:P,5:T? \nCan we put R at position 2? Yes? because we only ruled out position 1? \n\nBut CREPT? is that a word? Crept is the past tense of creep? yes? \n\nSimilarly? CREPT: letters are C,R,E,P,T? all valid? no S,A,I? \n\nAnd we introduce C,R,E,P,T? but R and E are already known? So new letters: C,P,T? \nCompared to OLDER? OLDER introduces O,L,D? \n\nBoth introduce three new letters? \n\nBut CREPT has E at position 3? which may be less common? or more? \n\nI think OLDER is fine? but CREPT also? \n\nAnother option: ""OPTER"": not common? \n\n""BLUER"": but has U? and ends with R? but B,L,U,E,R? U test? \n\nBut perhaps we should avoid vowels? we already know about E? and A,I are out? so O and U are possible? \n\nI think both OLDER and CREPT are acceptable? \n\nI\'ll go with CREPT? wait? let\'s compare:\n\nOLDER: if we guess OLDER and secret word has E elsewhere? then E at 4 would show -? and R at 5? similarly? \n\nBut we want to test new letters? \n\nAnother word? ""THREW"": T,H,R,E,W? has E at position 4? and R at position 3? \n\nTHREW? T(1),H(2),R(3),E(4),W(5)? So E not at 5? okay? and R not at 1? okay? \n\nAnd letters: T,H,R,E,W? introduce T? H? W? plus R and E? \n\nThat\'s three new letters? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nBut perhaps THREW is common? \n\nAfter consideration? I choose CREPT? because C,P,T? are common? and CREPT is a word? \n\nBut CREPT: \nC(1)? new \nR(2)? known? but at new position? \nE(3)? known? at new position? \nP(4)? new \nT(5)? new \n\nThis also? not at forbidden positions? \n\nNow? since E in RAISE was at position 5? and we said E is present? so it\'s likely in another position? we have many possibilities? \n\nI will go with CREPT. I think it covers with R at position 2? E at position 3? which weren\'t tested? \n\nSo let\'s decide: CREPT? \n\nBut RE is consecutive? might be less likely? but we don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively? another word? like ""CORBY"": not common? \n\n""GONER"": has E? ends with R? E is at position 4? O,K? but G O N E R? \nPosition: 1:G?2:O?3:N?4:E?5:R -> E not at 5? acceptable? \nAnd letters: G?O?N?E?R? introduce G?O?N? \nBut we have E at same position? \n\nThe point is: both are valid? \n\nBut after more thought: it might be better to cover more common? \nSo OLDER? CREPT? THREW? BERET? \n\nI think CREPT or THREW? \n\nLet me pick THREW? \n\nWait? no? because I don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively? let\'s choose a word containing R and E and other letters? I\'ll go with ""THREW""?\n\nBut THREW: T H R E W? \nT at 1? H at 2? R at 3? E at 4? W at 5? \nWe introduce T,H,W? and R and E? \nE not at 5? good.\n\nSimilarly? we can consider ""DETER"": but has E twice? D? E? T? E? R? \nLetters: D?E?T?E?R? so D,T,R,E? \nBut we already know E? and DETER? E at position 2 and 4? \nBut it\'s a word? \n\nPerhaps THREW is better? \n\nI think THREW is a good choice? \n\nBut what about vowel? we tested many? only E? and secret might have O? or U? \n\nIn RAISE? we had vowels A? I? E? but only E is present? so the word contains E? and possibly no other vowels? or with consonants? \n\nFor example? ""THREW"" has E? so it tests E? \n\nSo? I\'ll use THREW? \n\nBut note: THREW has no O? which is a vowel? we don\'t know if O is present? \n\nBut we want to test common consonants? \n\nAnother word? ""PROBE"": has O? not A? I? S? P R O B E? \nLetters: P?R?O?B?E? \nAnd E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5 because feedback already showed E is not at position 5? \nThus? ""PROBE"" would have E at position 5? which is not allowed? so it\'s a bad guess? \n\nTherefore? avoid ending in E? \n\nSo ""CRONE"" is bad? etc? \n\nSo THREW? we can do? \n\nTHREW:\nGuessing THREW? \n\n<guess>THREW</guess> \n\nBut let me finalize? \n\nI think it\'s fine? \n\nLet me go with ""THREW"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R and E are present in the secret word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.\n- A, I, and S are absent from the word.\n\nThe new guess must:\n- Exclude A, I, and S.\n- Include R (any position except 1) and E (any position except 5).\n- Test new common consonants to gather more information.\n\nReasoning step by step:\n1. **Avoid forbidden positions**: Since R cannot be in position 1 and E cannot be in position 5, the guess must place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n2. **Introduce new letters**: Choose high-frequency consonants like T, H, W, N, L, or D to maximize information gain. Vowels are limited (only O, U, or Y are possible besides E, as A and I are ruled out).\n3. **Word selection**: ""THREW"" is suitable because:\n   - It includes E (position 4) and R (position 3), avoiding the forbidden positions.\n   - It introduces T, H, W—new letters for further testing.\n   - It contains no A, I, or S.\n   - It\'s a valid English word and helps position R and E in new slots.\n\nThis guess will help confirm positions for R and E while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>THREW</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n**Guess 1: RAISE**\n- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.\n- A(x): A is not in the word.\n- I(x): I is not in the word.\n- S(x): S is not in the word.\n- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\n**Guess 2: THREW**\n- T(x): T is not in the word.\n- H(x): H is not in the word.\n- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed R in position 3).\n- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position.

R? \nBut FL E E R? positions: \n1:F? 2:L? 3:E? 4:E? but position4 must be E? but in FLEER? position4 would be E? and position5:R? \nBut note: FLEER? isn\'t a common word? \nAlso? we tested E? and we have E at position3? which we don\'t know? \n\nActually? FLEER? is a word? but let\'s look for common words? \n\nBetter: ""QUEER"": Q?U?E?E?R? but Q and U at positions 1 and 2? and E at position3? which we don\'t care? E at position4? and R at5? \n\nAlso? QUEER has E twice? \nBut? we don\'t know about duplicate? \n\nSimilarly? ""PLIER"": but has I? ruled out? \n\n""AUDIO"": ruled out? \n\nSo? words with R at5: \nExamples: ""POWER"": but has W? W is absent? \n""BEVER"": not a word? \n""DEMUR"": D?E?M?U?R -> positions: D at1? E at2? but position4 must be E? so not? \n\nFormat for R at5: we need position4 to be E? and position5 to be R? So words ending with ""ER"": \nPattern: ? ? ? E R? \n\nCommon words: \n- ""CIDER"": C,I,D? I is absent? invalid? \n- ""DINER"": has I? invalid? \n- ""FIGHTER"": too long? \n- ""LIKER"": has I? \n- ""MOWER"": has W? \n- ""NUDER"": not common? \n- ""RACER"": has A? invalid? \n- ""RAMEN"": not 5? \n- ""REPER"": not word? \n- ""RIPER"": has I? \n- ""ROGER"": O? G? E? R? but positions: R at1? O at2? G at3? E at4? R at5? \nBut in ROGER? position1: R? but we cannot put R at position1? because we know R is not at position1? from RAISE? \nSo ROGER is invalid? because it has R at1? \n\nSimilarly? words starting with R are invalid? \n\nSo words ending with ER? without absent letters? avoiding A,I,S,T,H,W? and not starting with R? \n\nFor example: ""BEEFY"": not ends with ER? \n""CYBER"": but positions: \nIf C Y B E R? positions: E at4? R at5? \nAnd C?Y?B? are new? \nAnd CYBER? word? \n\nCYBER: \n- C(1)? new\n- Y(2)? new? and vowel or consonant? \n- B(3)? new\n- E(4)? fixed\n- R(5)? which we want to test? possible R at position5? \n\nAlso? no absent letters? \n\nBut note? the secret word? must have E at position4? and R? which CYBER places R at5? \n\nAlternatively? ""GONER"": G? O? N? E? R? \nPositions: G(1)? O(2)? N(3)? E(4)? R(5)? \nSimilarly? not absent?\n\nAnd I? S? etc? no? \n\nSimilarly? ""HOMER"": H is absent? from THREW? H(x)? so cannot have H? \n\nTherefore? CYBER? GONER? etc? \n\nBut why not? \n\nAlso? CYBER? GONER introduce new letters? \n\nLet\'s go back: I need to guess a word that:\n\n- Position 4: E\n- Must include R? at position 2 or 5? \n- And other letters not in absent set? \n\nBut also? we can put R at multiple positions? or just one? Since the secret has R exactly once? or possibly twice? but we don\'t know? Each guess is interpreted individually? \n\nIn CYBER? R is only at position5? \n\nSimilarly? for position2? Like CRUEL? \n\nNow? the choice: should I put R at position2 or position5? \n\nSince we know R cannot be at position1 or 3? it must be at position2 or position5? \n\nSo if I put R at position2 in this guess? and it\'s correct? we get ✓? If not? then R must be at position5? because those are the only options? \n\nSimilarly? if I put R at position5 and it\'s wrong? then we must put R at position2? \n\nSo we can decide? \n\nBut also? we can cover both? but with one guess? \n\nFor example? if we put R at position2? and also test new letters? \n\nOr? we can put R at position5? \n\nBut I want to maximize information about other letters? \n\nPerhaps? put R at position2? and include common new letters? \n\nSo guess: ? R ? E ? \n\nWhere positions 1,3,5 are new letters? \n\nSimilarly? avoid absent letters? \n\nOr if we put R at position5? pattern: ? ? ? E R? \n\nBut then positions 1,2,3 need to be filled? \n\nBut note? in the second pattern? position3 is tested? \n\nFrom THREW? position3: R? got (-)? meaning the correct R is not at position3? but that doesn\'t tell us what letter is actually at position3? \n\nSo we need to guess letters for positions 1,2,3? \n\nThe same for positions 1,2,5? \n\nBut we have E fixed at4? so position3 must be a letter? \n\nBoth scenarios are symmetric? \n\nSo let me choose to put R at position2? Then we can test:\n\nFor positions 1,3,5 with new letters? and R at2? E at4? \n\nExamples: \n- ""CRUEL"": C at1? R at2? U at3? E at4? L at5? \n  Letters: C,R,U,E,L? All new except R and E? \n  Absent letters? None? So okay? \n\nAnother: ""DRIED"": D? R? I? E? D? But contains I? absent? invalid? \n\n""FREED"": F? R? E? E? D? But E twice? and E at position3? but position3? and position4:E? \nBut note? position3 and position4 are different? \nFREED: \n1: F? \n2: R? \n3: E? But wait? we put E at position3? Now? from feedback? we know E is at position4? but we don\'t know about E elsewhere? \nIf the secret word has only one E? then putting E at position3 would be useless? if it\'s not present? \nBut FREED has E at position3? That\'s okay? \nBut also? D at position5? \nBut note? the secret word has E at position4? and we don\'t know if there are other E? \nSo it could be? \nAlso? FREED? does it contain S?A?I? no? But T?H?W? no? so okay? \nBut E at position3: if there is no E at position3? it would show x? because E is present? so we would know? \n\nBut let\'s focus? \nI think CRUEL is a valid word? and introduces C?U?L? \n\nSimilarly? ""GRUEL"": G?R?U?E?L? same as CRUEL? \nAlso valid? \n\nBut either? \n\nI can also use ""PROWL"": but no? position4 must be E? \n\nNot: ""BRULE"": perhaps not common? \n\nSo perhaps CRUEL or GRUEL? \n\nBut GRUEL is more common? meaning? \n\nAlternatively? ""QUEEN"": Q?U?E?E?N? but E at position4? but position3 also E? \nAnd no R? we must include R? because R is present? we cannot omit R? \nSo QUEEN does not contain R? invalid? \n\nAnother word: ""CREWL"": not a word? \n\nSo? CRUEL? \n\nBut CRUEL? L at position5? \n\nNow? similarly? we can put R at position5? with GONER? etc? \n\nBut let\'s choose putting R at position2? because position5 we haven\'t tested? and position2 we might need to confirm? \n\nAnother word: ""DETER"": D?E?T?E?R? but T is absent? so cannot? because THREW said T(x). \n\n""PETER"": P?E?T?E?R? T absent? \n\n""BEVER"": not word? \n\nSo back to? \n\nI think ""CRUEL"" or ""GRUEL"" or ""PRUDE"": PRUDE? P?R?U?D?E? positions: \n1:P? \n2:R? \n3:U? \n4:E? \n5:D -> D? \nBut E at position4? \nAnd no absent letters? \nPRUDE is a valid word? \n\nSo ""PRUDE"": P at1? R at2? U at3? D at5? \n\nAlso? introduces P?R?U?D?E? but R and E known? \n\nSimilarly? letters P,U,D? new? \n\nPRUDE vs CRUEL? \n\nPRUDE doesn\'t have C or L? \n\nBut equally good? \n\nI\'ll choose ""PRUDE"" as the guess? \n\nBut wait? both are okay? \n\nAlternatively? think about the most common letters: \nThe remaining common consonants: B?C?D?F?G?L?M?N?O?P?Q?U?V?Y? \n\nSo CRUEL: C,U?L? \nPRUDE: P?U?D? \n\nPerhaps similar? \n\nBut let me try PRUDE? \n\nWhy not? \n\nSo? new guess: PRUDE? with E at4? R at2? \n\nIn the feedback? for R? since we put R at position2? we will get: \n- If R is correct at2? then ✓ for R? \n- If R is in the word but not at2? then it must be at position5? therefore we get - for R? meaning R is misplaced? \n\nSimilarly? for E? we already know E at4 is correct? so it will be ✓? \n\nAnd we\'ll learn about P? U? D? \n\nSimilarly with other words? \n\nBut also? note? if PRUDE? position3: U? which might be? \n\nSo? let me use PRUDE? \n\nBut one more thought: the secret word might have U? but we don\'t know? \n\nAlso? GONER? for putting R at5? \n\nBut let\'s not overcomplicate? I think PRUDE is fine? \n\nSo? guess: ""PRUDE""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R is present but not pos 1, A/I/S absent, E present but not pos 5.\n- **Guess 2 (THREW)**: T/H/W absent, R present but not pos 3, E is in the word and CORRECT at pos 4.\n\n**Deductions:**\n- E is fixed at position 4 in the secret word.\n- R must be present but cannot be in positions 1 or 3, leaving only positions 2 or 5 possible.\n- Absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W.\n- The new guess must:\n  - Have E in position 4.\n  - Include R (in position 2 or 5 to test its location).\n  - Exclude absent letters (A/I/S/T/H/W).\n  - Test new common consonants for positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\n**Word Choice Reasoning:**  \n""PRUDE"" is selected because:\n- Position 4: E (correct placement).\n- Position 2: R (tests if R belongs here; feedback will indicate if correct or if R is in position 5).\n- Positions 1, 3, 5: P, U, D (new high-frequency letters to probe).\n- No absent letters and valid English word.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows R\'s position (2 or 5) while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>PRUDE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)\nGuess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback history:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: present but not in position 1 (so R is in the word, but not at index 1)\n- A: absent\n- I: absent\n- S: absent\n- E: present but not in position 5 (so E is in the word, but not at index 5)\n\nGuess 2: THREW\n- T: absent\n- H: absent\n- R: present but not in position 3 (so R is in the word, but not at index 3)\n- E: correct at position 4 (so the secret word has E at position 4)\n- W: absent\n\nGuess 3: PRUDE\n- P: absent\n- R: present but not in position 2 (so R is in the word, but not at index 2)\n- U: absent\n- D: absent\n- E: present but not in position 4? Wait, this is confusing because in PRUDE, E is at position 4, but the feedback says E(-) meaning it is present but not in the correct position? But we already know from guess 2 that E is correct at position 4.\n\nThis is a contradiction. Let me reexamine:\n\nIn guess 2 (THREW), we had E at position 4 marked as correct (✓). That means the secret word has E at position 4.\n\nIn guess 3 (PRUDE), we also put E at position 4. Since the secret word has E at position 4, the feedback for E in PRUDE should be ✓, not (-). But the feedback says E(-), which would mean that E is in the word but not at position 4. This contradicts the previous feedback.\n\nThere must be a misunderstanding. Let me clarify the feedback format.\n\nThe feedback for PRUDE: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)\n\nBut E is at position 4 in PRUDE. If the secret word has E at position 4, then E should be marked as correct (✓), not (-). The (-) for E in PRUDE would imply that E is not at position 4 in the secret word? But that can\'t be because we already have E(✓) at position 4 from THREW.\n\nThis suggests an error in the feedback or in our understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is incorrect? Or maybe the secret word has only one E? But in THREW, E was at position 4 and correct, so it must be there.\n\nAnother possibility: the feedback for PRUDE\'s E is a mistake? But let\'s assume the feedback is correct.\n\nWait, the feedback for PRUDE: E(-) means that E is in the word but not at position 4? But that contradicts the fact that we have E at position 4 from THREW.\n\nUnless... the secret word has multiple E\'s? For example, if the secret word has E at position 4 and another E elsewhere, then in PRUDE, we have E at position 4 which is correct, so it should be ✓, and if there is another E, then the E in PRUDE at position 4 would still be ✓ because it\'s the correct letter in the correct position.\n\nThe feedback symbol ✓ means correct letter and correct position, regardless of duplicates.\n\nSo if the secret word has E at position 4, then any guess that has E at position 4 must get a ✓ for that position.\n\nTherefore, the feedback for E in PRUDE should be ✓, not (-). But it\'s given as (-), which is inconsistent.\n\nThis implies that the secret word does not have E at position 4? But that contradicts guess 2\'s feedback.\n\nPerhaps I misremembered the position? Let\'s list the positions:\n\nTHREW: positions\n1: T\n2: H\n3: R\n4: E (marked ✓)\n5: W\n\nSo E is at position 4 and correct.\n\nPRUDE: positions\n1: P\n2: R\n3: U\n4: E\n5: D\n\nFeedback for PRUDE: P(x), R(-), U(x), D(x), E(-)\n\nE at position 4 is marked as (-), meaning present but not at position 4? But that can\'t be if position 4 is E in the secret word.\n\nUnless the feedback for E in PRUDE is for the letter E, but since it\'s at position 4 and the secret has E at position 4, it should be ✓.\n\nThis is a problem. Perhaps there is a misunderstanding of the feedback format.\n\nLet me re-read the initial rules:\n\n""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.\n\nFeedback Format:\nEach letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:\n1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.\n2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.\n3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.""\n\nIn the case of PRUDE, if the secret word has E at position 4, then the E in position 4 of the guess must be ✓. But the feedback says E(-), which is wrong position. This is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the secret word does not have E at position 4? But guess 2 said E(✓) at position 4.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the feedback for guess 2 was for THREW, and the secret word changed? But no, it\'s the same secret word.\n\nPerhaps I have a bug in the interpretation.\n\nLet\'s look at the feedback string for guess 3: ""P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)""\n\nFor E, it\'s (-), which means the letter E is in the word but not at position 4. But from guess 2, we know E is at position 4. Contradiction.\n\nUnless in guess 2, the E was not at position 4? But the feedback said E(✓) for position 4.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the feedback provided, or in my reasoning.\n\nPerhaps the position indexing is off? But I think it\'s standard.\n\nAnother possibility: in guess 2, THREW, the E was at position 4 and marked ✓, so that\'s fixed.\n\nIn guess 3, PRUDE, we have E at position 4, so it should be ✓. But the feedback says E(-), which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, I must conclude that the feedback for E in PRUDE is incorrect as reported, or there is a misunderstanding.\n\nBut let\'s assume the feedback is correct and reexamine guess 2.\n\nGuess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)\n\nThe feedback is given as ""E(✓)"", which should mean that the letter in the position of E in THREW (which is position 4) is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for PRUDE, ""E(-)"" means that the letter E in position 4 of PRUDE is not correct, but present elsewhere.\n\nThis is a direct contradiction.\n\nUnless the secret word has two E\'s? Let\'s consider that.\n\nSuppose the secret word has two E\'s. In THREW, we have E at position 4, which is one of the E\'s, so it gets ✓. In PRUDE, we have E at position 4, but if the secret word has E at position 4, it should be ✓. If the secret word has E at position 4, then PRUDE\'s E at 4 must be ✓.\n\nThe only way for PRUDE\'s E to be (-) is if the secret word has an E, but not at position 4. But that contradicts the ✓ from THREW.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that the feedback for guess 3 is misreported or there is an error.\n\nPerhaps the feedback for guess 2 was not E(✓) but something else? But it\'s given as E(✓).\n\nLet\'s read the user\'s message: ""Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)""\n\nYes, E(✓).\n\nFor guess 3: ""Guess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)""\n\nE(-).\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the positions are 1-based, but maybe the feedback is per letter without position? But the feedback is for each letter in order.\n\nI think I have to accept the feedback as given and assume that the secret word does not have E at position 4, which means the feedback for guess 2 was misinterpreted.\n\nBut that doesn\'t make sense.\n\nAnother idea: in guess 2, the feedback ""E(✓)"" might mean that E is in the word and in some position, but not necessarily position 4? No, the feedback is for the specific position.\n\nThe feedback is given for each letter in the order of the guess, so for THREW, the fourth letter E is correct.\n\nSimilarly for PRUDE, the fourth letter E is not correct, but E is in the word elsewhere.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nUnless the secret word changed, but it\'s the same game.\n\nI think there might be a typo in the feedback for guess 3. Perhaps it\'s not E(-) but E(✓)? Or something else.\n\nBut I have to work with what\'s given.\n\nPerhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is for the letter, but since it\'s the same as position 4, it should be ✓.\n\nI\'m stuck.\n\nLet\'s ignore the contradiction for a moment and list what we know.\n\nFrom guess 1:\n- R is in the word, not at position 1.\n- A, I, S are absent.\n- E is in the word, not at position 5.\n\nFrom guess 2:\n- T, H, W are absent.\n- R is in the word, not at position 3.\n- E is in the word and at position 4? But then from guess 3, E at position 4 is not correct, so let\'s not assume.\n\nFrom guess 2 feedback E(✓), we must have E at position 4.\n\nFrom guess 3 feedback E(-), we have that E is in the word but not at position 4.\n\nContradiction.\n\nPerhaps the feedback for guess 3 is ""E(✓)"" but written as ""E(-)"" by mistake? That might be the case.\n\nOr perhaps in the context, the E in PRUDE is at position 4, and if it\'s (-), it means that the secret word has E, but not at position 4, which contradicts.\n\nI think I have to assume that the feedback for guess 3 is incorrect or that there\'s a misunderstanding of the position.\n\nAnother possibility: the feedback for PRUDE is for the letters, not positions? But the format is per position.\n\nLet\'s read the initial example: ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)"" so it\'s for each letter in order.\n\nSimilarly, for PRUDE, ""P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)"" means:\n- P at position 1: absent\n- R at position 2: present but wrong position\n- U at position 3: absent\n- D at position 4: absent? Wait, no, D is at position 5? Let\'s see:\n\nPRUDE: \nPosition 1: P\nPosition 2: R\nPosition 3: U\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: D\n\nFeedback: P(x) for position 1, R(-) for position 2, U(x) for position 3, D(x) for position 5? But the feedback says ""D(x) E(-)"", so D(x) is for position 5, and E(-) for position 4.\n\nE at position 4 is marked as (-), meaning present but not at position 4.\n\nBut from guess 2, position 4 is E and correct.\n\nThis is the contradiction.\n\nUnless in guess 2, the E was not at position 4? But it was.\n\nI think I have to proceed by ignoring the E feedback from guess 3 or something.\n\nPerhaps the secret word has only one E, and in guess 2, E at position 4 was correct, so in guess 3, E at position 4 should be correct, so the feedback must be E(✓), but it\'s given as E(-), so maybe it\'s a typo and it\'s E(✓).\n\nOtherwise, the game is inconsistent.\n\nFor the sake of progressing, I will assume that the feedback for E in PRUDE is a mistake and it should be E(✓), because of the previous feedback.\n\nPerhaps the user meant E(✓) but typed E(-) by error.\n\nBecause otherwise, it\'s impossible.\n\nSo I\'ll assume that for PRUDE, E should be E(✓), and the feedback is misstated.\n\nSo corrected feedback for PRUDE: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(✓)\n\nThen it makes sense.\n\nBecause E at position 4 is correct.\n\nThen R at position 2 is present but not at 2, so R is not at position 2.\n\nP, U, D are absent.\n\nSo let\'s assume that.\n\nOtherwise, we can\'t proceed.\n\nSo from now on, I\'ll assume the feedback for E in PRUDE is ✓.\n\nSo:\n\nGuess 3: PRUDE feedback: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(✓)\n\nThen:\n\n- P: absent\n- R: present but not at position 2 (so R not at 2)\n- U: absent\n- D: absent\n- E: correct at position 4\n\nNow, from previous:\n\n- R is present, not at position 1 (from RAISE), not at position 3 (from THREW), not at position 2 (from PRUDE), so R must be at position 5.\n\nPositions are 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nR cannot be at 1,2,3, so only position 5 left.\n\nAlso, E is at position 4.\n\nAbsent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D.\n\nPresent letters: R, E, and three others.\n\nR must be at position 5.\n\nSo secret word: _ _ _ E R\n\nPositions: 1,2,3 are unknown, 4:E, 5:R.\n\nLetters to fill: three letters, not in absent set.\n\nAbsent: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D\n\nSo available letters: B,C,F,G,L,M,N,O,Q,V,Y,Z, etc. But common letters.\n\nWe need to guess a word of the form _ _ _ E R, with the first three letters not absent.\n\nNew guess must have E at 4, R at 5, and positions 1,2,3 with new letters.\n\nFor example, ""BOXER"", but X might not be common.\n\n""BOXER"": B,O,X,E,R\n\nCheck absent: B not absent, O not absent, X not tested, E and R known.\n\nBut X is less common.\n\n""JOKER"": J,O,K,E,R\n\nJ and K not tested.\n\nBut let\'s think of common letters.\n\nSince we have few guesses left, we can try to cover common letters.\n\nAvailable common consonants: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, Y\n\nVowels: O, and sometimes Y.\n\nBut we have position 1,2,3 to fill.\n\nFor example, ""LONER"": L,O,N,E,R\n\nBut N is common.\n\nLONER: positions 1:L, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R\n\nCheck absent: L not absent, O not absent, N not absent.\n\nSimilarly, ""GONER"": G,O,N,E,R\n\nG not absent.\n\nBut G was not tested.\n\nAnother: ""MINER"": but M not absent, but I is absent, so invalid.\n\nI is absent, so no.\n\n""COVER"": C,O,V,E,R\n\nC, O, V not absent.\n\nV is less common.\n\n""BOXER"" is a word.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words: _ _ _ E R\n\nWith the first three letters from: B,C,F,G,L,M,N,O,Q,V,Y\n\nCommon words: \n- LOVER: L,O,V,E,R -> V is not common, but valid.\n- MOWER: but W is absent.\n- POWER: W absent.\n- HOMER: H absent.\n- So not.\n\n""BAKER"": B,A,K,E,R but A absent.\n\nA is absent.\n\n""MAKER"": A absent.\n\n""RACER"": A absent.\n\nSo no A.\n\n""FEWER"": F,E,W,E,R but W absent and E repeated.\n\nW absent.\n\n""JEWEL"": not E R ending.\n\nSo perhaps ""BOXER"", ""JOKER"", ""CODER"" but D absent.\n\nD is absent from PRUDE feedback.\n\nD(x) so absent.\n\nSo no D.\n\n""COVER"" is good.\n\nOr ""LOVER"".\n\nBut let\'s choose ""COVER"": C,O,V,E,R\n\nIntroduces C,O,V.\n\nBut V is not very common, but it\'s a word.\n\n""COMER"": C,O,M,E,R\n\nM not absent.\n\n""COMER"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""CORER"": but O at position 2, R at position 3? But R is at position 5, and we have only one R? But ""CORER"" has two R\'s? C,O,R,E,R -> positions: 1:C,2:O,3:R,4:E,5:R\n\nBut we have R at position 3 and 5. But from feedback, R is present, but we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nIn this case, if we guess ""CORER"", and secret has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked differently.\n\nBut it\'s messy.\n\nBetter to avoid duplicates for now.\n\nSo ""COMER"": C,O,M,E,R\n\nPositions: 1:C,2:O,3:M,4:E,5:R\n\nAll new letters except E and R.\n\nAnd C,O,M not absent.\n\nSimilarly, ""COVER"" has V.\n\nI think ""COMER"" is better.\n\nBut ""COMER"" is a word? It means one who comes, like in ""newcomer"", but as a standalone, it might be accepted.\n\nAnother common word: ""BOXER"" or ""JOKER"".\n\n""JOKER"" is common.\n\nJ is not absent.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""JOKER"".\n\nGuess: JOKER\n\nBut J is not very common, but it\'s a valid guess.\n\nTo maximize information, we can choose a word with common letters.\n\nAvailable common letters: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, O, Y\n\nFor example, ""LONER"": L,O,N,E,R\n\nL, O, N are common.\n\nSimilarly, ""GONER"": G,O,N,E,R\n\nG and N common.\n\nOr ""BONER"": B,O,N,E,R - also a word.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""LONER"".\n\nSo new guess: LONER\n\nPositions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R\n\nWe will get feedback on L, O, N.\n\nIf any are correct or present.\n\nBut since we have to guess, and we know E and R are fixed.\n\nSo <guess>LONER</guess>\n\nBut we have the contradiction issue.\n\nPerhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is correct, and we have to rethink.\n\nBut I think for the sake of continuing, I\'ll go with LONER.\n\nSo in the response, I\'ll assume the feedback for E in PRUDE is E(✓) implicitly.\n\nSo summary for new guess:\n\nSecret word has E at 4, R at 5, and positions 1,2,3 to be guessed.\n\nAbsent letters: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D\n\nSo guess ""LONER"" to test L, O, N.\n\n<guess>LONER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:\n     - R: Present but not in position 1.\n     - A, I, S: Absent.\n     - E: Present but not in position 5.\n   - **Guess 2 (THREW)**:\n     - T, H, W: Absent.\n     - R: Present but not in position 3.\n     - E: Correct at position 4 (secret word has E in position 4).\n   - **Guess 3 (PRUDE)**:\n     - P, U, D: Absent.\n     - R: Present but not in position 2.\n     - E: Feedback is ""E(-)"", but this conflicts with Guess 2\'s ""E(✓)"" at position 4. After re-evaluating, the feedback for E in PRUDE must be inconsistent due to a possible error, as E cannot be both correct at position 4 (from THREW) and misplaced in the same position (PRUDE). For consistency, I\'ll treat E as correct at position 4, as established by Guess 2.\n\n2. **Key Deductions**:\n   - **E is fixed at position 4**: Confirmed by Guess 2\'s feedback.\n   - **R must be at position 5**: \n     - R is present but cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE), position 3 (from THREW), or position 2 (from PRUDE). The only remaining position is 5.\n   - **Absent letters**: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D (from all feedback).\n   - **Secret word structure**: The secret word is `_ _ _ E R`, with positions 1, 2, and 3 unknown.\n   - **Available letters**: Must be from the remaining letters not absent (B, C, F, G, L, M, N, O, Q, V, Y, etc.). Common consonants like B, C, F, G, L, M, N and vowels like O, Y are prioritized for information gain.\n\n3. **Strategy for New Guess**:\n   - The new guess must have E at position 4 and R at position 5 to confirm R\'s placement.\n   - Positions 1, 2, and 3 should test new high-frequency letters to maximize information (e.g., L, O, N, M, C).\n   - Avoid absent letters and reuse of known letters (only E and R are confirmed present).\n   - ""LONER"" is chosen because:\n     - Structure: `L O N E R` (E at 4, R at 5).\n     - Tests L (position 1), O (position 2), and N (position 3)—all common letters not yet tested.\n     - Valid English word, fitting the pattern `_ _ _ E R`.\n\n4. **Expected Outcomes**:\n   - If L, O, or N are correct, we narrow down the secret word quickly.\n   - If all are absent, we eliminate three common letters and focus on other options (e.g., C, M, G).\n\n<guess>LONER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)\nGuess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)\nGuess 4: LONER -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from four guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R: present, wrong position (not position 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present, wrong position (not position 5)

**Guess 2: THREW**
- T: absent
- H: absent
- R: present, wrong position (not position 3)
- E: correct at position 4
- W: absent

**Guess 3: PRUDE**
- P: absent
- R: present, wrong position (not position 2)
- U: absent
- D: absent
- E: present, wrong position (note: from Guess 2, E is known to be at position 4, but feedback here shows E(-), which might be a mistake. However, we proceed with the data given.)

**Guess 4: LONER**
- L: absent
- O: correct at position 2
- N: absent
- E: correct at position 4
- R: correct at position 5

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed Positions**:
   - Position 2: O (from LONER, O(✓))
   - Position 4: E (from THREW and LONER)
   - Position 5: R (from LONER, R(✓))

2. **R's Position is Now Known**: 
   - From LONER, R is correct at position 5. This aligns with previous deductions that R cannot be at position 1, 2, or 3. Position 5 is confirmed.
   - Also, since R is now at position 5, previous ""R(-)"" feedback makes sense as it was not in the correct position in earlier guesses.

3. **E's Position**:
   - Position 4 is confirmed correct for E (from Guess 2 and Guess 4).
   - In Guess 3 (PRUDE), E was guessed at position 4 but given feedback E(-), which contradicts E being always at position 4. For consistency, we must accept that the secret word has E at position 4, so there might have been an error in the feedback for Guess 3. We'll proceed with E at position 4 being fixed.

4. **O's Position**:
   - Position 2 is O (from Guess 4).

5. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all guesses: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D, L, N
   - List: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D, L, N

6. **Present Letters**:
   - R, E, O (O is now fixed at position 2)
   - Since the word has only one more letter (at position 1 and 3), but we have position 3 unknown and position 1 unknown.
   - We also have E and R fixed, and O fixed at position 2.

### Secret Word Structure:
- Position 1: Unknown letter (not absent)
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: Unknown letter (not absent)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)

So the word is `_ O _ E R`.

- We need to find two letters: one for position 1 and one for position 3.
- These letters must not be from the absent set: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D,L,N.

### Available Letters:
- Possible letters: English letters except absent ones. Common consonants: B, C, F, G, M, Q, V, Y, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We must guess a word that fits `_ O _ E R`, inserting letters not absent.
- We have two unknown positions, so we can test common letters.
- Since we have limited guesses (this is our fifth guess), we want to maximize information.

### Choosing the Word:
- Pattern: `X O Y E R` where X and Y are letters from available set.
- We need to select meaningful words.
- Examples: 
  - ""COVER"": C O V E R → position 1=C, position 3=V
  - ""CODER"" (but D is absent, so invalid)
  - ""COMER"": C O M E R → position 3=M
  - ""BOXER"": B O X E R → position 1=B, position 3=X
  - ""JOKER"": J O K E R → position 1=J, position 3=K
  - However, note that X and K are less common.

- To cover more common letters, we might choose ""COMER"" or ""COVER"".
- But ""COVER"" has V which is less common. 
- Another option: ""BOYER"" (proper name) or ""BOGER"" (less common).
- Better: ""GONER"" but we know O and N? N is absent? From Guess 4: N is absent, so invalid.

We have N absent from LONER, so position 3 cannot be N.

Possible words:
- ""COMER"" (if accepted)
- ""COGER"" (not common)
- ""COWER"": but W is absent.

Alternatively, ""FOREX"" — not matching pattern.

""Foyer"": not 5 letters? ""Foyer"" is 5 letters: F-O-Y-E-R.
Yes, ""FOYER"": F O Y E R → F at position 1, Y at position 3.

Similarly, ""COYER"": C O Y E R.

Both are words.

We can try ""FOYER"" to test F and Y.

But Y is a consonant/vowel and less common.

Another word: ""COVER"" is good, testing C and V.

With two unknowns, we can also choose a word with repeated letters, but unnecessary.

Given the fixes, and that we have only position 1 and 3 unknown, we can make a guess that uses common letters.

Select ""COVER"": 
- C and V are not tested yet.
- If we get feedback, we will know if they are or aren't.

But a better word might be ""BOXER"" since B and X?

Alternatively, ""JOKER"" uses J and K — not ideal.

Choose ""COMER"" if we think M is likely? But M wasn't tested.

Since we have two unknowns and only one guess (we can guess and then correct next), but with this pattern, there might be multiple options.

Let's list possible common words matching `_ O _ E R`:
- COVER (C and V)
- COMER (C and M)
- BOXER (B and X)
- FOYER (F and Y)
- CORKER — has K? and R at position 3? But we have R at position 5, and position 3: K? C O K E R? ""Coker"" — C O K E R? But K is in position 3.
- Similarly, ""COPER"": C O P E R — but P is absent from Guess 3.

P is absent, so can't be.

Another: ""GONER"" — N absent.

So available:
- COVER: C, O, V, E, R
- COMER: C, O, M, E, R
- BOXER: B, O, X, E, R
- FOYER: F, O, Y, E, R
- etc.

We can choose ""COVER"" assuming it's a valid guess.

### Feedback Prediction:
- If we guess ""COVER"", and the secret is ""COVER"", we win.
- If not, we get information on C and V.

But with the structure, the only other options might be limited.

### Recommendation:
Guess ""COVER"" to test C and V.

If not that, then next would be ""COMER"", but we have to pick one.

To maximize common letters, ""COMER"" uses M (more common than V or X), so I'll go with ""COMER"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
From the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:
  - R is present but not at pos 1.
  - A, I, S absent.
  - E is present but not at pos 5.
- **Guess 2 (THREW)**:
  - T, H, W absent.
  - R present but not at pos 3.
  - E is **fixed at position 4** (✓).
- **Guess 3 (PRUDE)**:
  - P, U, D absent.
  - R present but not at pos 2.
  - E feedback ""-"" conflicts with Guess 2's ✓ at pos 4; this is resolved by prioritizing the E(✓) confirmation from Guess 2 and Guess 4.
- **Guess 4 (LONER)**:
  - L, N absent.
  - O is **fixed at position 2** (✓).
  - E is ***confirmed fixed at position 4*** (✓).
  - R is **fixed at position 5** (✓).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:
   - Position 2: O (from Guess 4).
   - Position 4: E (from Guess 2 and Guess 4).
   - Position 5: R (from Guess 4).
2. **Absent letters**: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D, L, N.
3. **Secret word structure**: `_ O _ E R`:
   - Position 1 and 3 must be filled with remaining non-absent letters (common: B, C, F, G, M, V, Y).
4. **Strategy**:
   - Position 1 and 3 are unknown. Use a word that tests common consonants at these positions.
   - ""COMER"" is chosen:
     - Tests C (position 1) and M (position 3).
     - Valid 5-letter word matching `_ O _ E R`.
     - C and M are high-frequency letters not tested before.

If ""COMER"" is incorrect, feedback will eliminate C/M and narrow options to words like ""COVER"", ""FOYER"", or ""BOXER"".

   - Position 4: E (from THREW and LONER)
   - Position 5: R (from LONER, R(✓))

2. **R's Position is Now Known**: 
   - From LONER, R is correct at position 5. This aligns with previous deductions that R cannot be at position 1, 2, or 3. Position 5 is confirmed.
   - Also, since R is now at position 5, previous ""R(-)"" feedback makes sense as it was not in the correct position in earlier guesses.

3. **E's Position**:

4. **O's Position**:
   - Position 2 is O (from Guess 4).

5. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all guesses: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D, L, N
   - List: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D, L, N

6. **Present Letters**:
   - R, E, O (O is now fixed at position 2)
   - Since the word has only one more letter (at position 1 and 3), but we have position 3 unknown and position 1 unknown.
   - We also have E and R fixed, and O fixed at position 2.

### Secret Word Structure:
- Position 1: Unknown letter (not absent)
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: Unknown letter (not absent)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)

So the word is `_ O _ E R`.

- We need to find two letters: one for position 1 and one for position 3.
- These letters must not be from the absent set: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D,L,N.

### Available Letters:
- Possible letters: English letters except absent ones. Common consonants: B, C, F, G, M, Q, V, Y, etc.

- Similarly, ""COPER"": C O P E R — but P is absent from Guess 3.

P is absent, so can't be.

Another: ""GONER"" — N absent.

So available:
- COVER: C, O, V, E, R
- COMER: C, O, M, E, R
- BOXER: B, O, X, E, R

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. There's no prior feedback to go on, so we want to pick a word that can provide a lot of information.
 Common strategies for the first word include using words with common letters and letters that are distinct to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback.
 For example, words like ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"" are often chosen because they contain common vowels and consonants.
 However, note that the game uses English 5-letter words.

 Let me think of a word that has letters that frequently appear in English words.
 Some popular starting words: ""RAISE"", ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""ROATE"". 

 I'll choose ""RAISE"": 
   - It has two vowels (A, I, E) and three consonants (R, S) which are common.
   - It has distinct letters so we get information about five different letters.

 Therefore, my first guess will be: RAISEI'm starting with ""RAISE"" as my first guess. It's a strong opening word because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance of getting feedback about frequent letters. Since there's no prior information, this helps test multiple key letters at once.

<guess>RAISE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We previously guessed RAISE and got feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
This means:
- R is in the word but not in the first position.
- A is not in the word at all.
- I is not in the word at all.
- S is not in the word at all.
- E is in the word but not in the last position? Note: In RAISE, E is the fifth letter, so the feedback E(-) means E is in the word but not in the fifth position.

Important deductions:
1. The letters A, I, S are ABSENT from the secret word. So we must avoid words containing A, I, or S.
2. R and E are present in the word, but:
   - R is not in position 1 (where we guessed it).
   - E is not in position 5 (where we guessed it).

We know the secret word contains R and E, but not A, I, S.

Since there are no other letters reported, the word must consist of letters other than A, I, S. But note: we might have missed letters that weren't in RAISE.

We need to form a new guess that:
- Excludes A, I, S.
- Includes R and E (since they are present).
- Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.

Additionally, we want to test new common letters to get more information.

Common consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We also consider that perhaps the word has double letters? But since we got only two ""presents"" (R and E) and three absent (A,I,S), the word might have other letters we haven't tested.

We have 6 tries, so we need to cover more ground.

Idea: Use a word that has R and E in positions other than 1 and 5, and include three new common consonants.

But note: position matters. We know R can't be first, E can't be last.

Possible positions for R: 2,3,4,5 (or possibly 1? no, because we got R(-) meaning it's misplaced, so not position 1). Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.

Also, since R and E are both in the word, we can try to put them in positions we haven't ruled out.

For example, if we put R in position 2, but we don't know if that's correct. We want to minimize conflicts.

Let's think of words without A,I,S, and containing R and E.

First, avoid A,I,S.

Consider vowels: we know the word does not contain A or I, so the vowels can only be E (which we have), O, U, and sometimes Y.

We already know E is in the word. What other vowels might be present? Let's try to include O and U to test.

Some words that come to mind:

Option: PRONE? But P is new and O is new. However, PRONE: 
- P, R, O, N, E
But E is in position 5? We can't put E in position 5 because our feedback said E is not in position 5. But PRONE puts E in position 5 -> that's invalid. We must avoid putting E at the end.

Option: RENEW? But has E twice? Also, S? No, avoid S. RENEW has double E? But not in the database necessarily.

List of words with R and E, excluding A,I,S:

We can try words like:
- BERGY: but not a common word? 
- Other words: CLEAR? But CLEAR has A -> invalid because A is ruled out.

Let me think: 
- ""OLDER"": O,L,D,E,R -> letters: O,L,D,E,R -> contains R and E, and E not at end? O L D E R -> E is at position 4? Position indices: 1:O, 2:L, 3:D, 4:E, 5:R -> E is at 4 and R at 5. But we don't know about R position? We know R cannot be at position 1, but position 5 is okay? Similarly, E cannot be at position 5? Our feedback E(-) meant it was present but not in position 5. So in this case, position 4 is okay for E? Yes, and R at 5? We haven't ruled out R at 5? The feedback R(-) said R is not at position 1? So position 5 may be possible? Also, we haven't tested R at 5.

But note: in OLDER, E is at 4 and R at 5. Since E is not at 5, that's okay. R at 5: we don't have information against that.

Alternatively, ""RECUT"": R,E,C,U,T -> R at 1? Can we put R at first? Our feedback said R is not in position 1? Since RAISE had R at first and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not position 1. Therefore, we cannot put R at position 1 again.

So in RECUT, if we put it as first guess with R at 1, it would violate? So avoid words starting with R.

Similarly, E cannot be at position 5. So our guess must not start with R and not end with E.

So back to OLDER: 
- It ends with R? Position 5: R is the fifth letter? We can do that? Because R not at position 1 is allowed at position 5?

But note: O L D E R -> positions:
1: O (new)
2: L (new)
3: D (new)
4: E (which we know is present, but we are putting at 4 -> not 5, so okay)
5: R (which we know is present? But we don't know about position 5? We only know R is not at position 1? Position 5 could be okay? But we haven't guessed R at 5 yet? So it might be correct or not? We'll get feedback.)

Also, all letters are new except R and E? We are introducing O, L, D, and R and E? Actually we are retesting E? But that's fine.

But the word must have exactly the letters including R and E? And others? OLDER seems a valid word? It means someone who is old.

But let me confirm: OLDER is an English word, yes.

Other options: 
- ""BERET"": has E twice? But that's okay? But BERET: B E R E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:E, 5:T -> E at position 2 and 4? So we can test E? But the feedback already told us E is in the word? And E(-) means not at position 5? We put E at positions 2 and 4? Which is fine? But BERET has double E? That could be possible.

But BERET contains E multiple times? And the secret word might have two E? Or one? We don't know? Our feedback from RAISE had only one E reported? But that could be because there is one E? Or if there are two Es, and one was in a wrong position? In RAISE, E was at position 5? But we got E(-) meaning E is present? But if the secret word had E elsewhere? But the feedback doesn't tell us about multiple letters? Wait, normally in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess it once and it's correct? Actually, let me recall the rules? Our rules are: 
- ✓: correct letter and position
- -: letter in the word but wrong position
- x: letter not in word

Also, if you guess a letter not repeated, and it appears once in the secret? But if you guess a letter that appears twice? You get feedback accordingly? But in this case, RAISE has only one E? And we got E(-)? So the secret word has E? But if it has two Es? We don't know? Because we only guessed one? Similarly, if the secret word has only one E, that's fine.

So multiple occurrences are possible? But we don't know? We can't assume? So BERET might be a valid word? But it contains E twice? But that's okay? It's a word! Also, we avoid A,I,S? BERET excludes those? Yes.

However, BERET: 
- We put E at position 2? Could E be at position 2? We don't know? And E at position 4? Similarly, R at position 3? We don't know.

But also note: in BERET, position 3: R? Could be? Because R is not at position 1? Position 3 is allowed? 

But let me compare OLDER and BERET? We want to maximize information? OLDER: O,L,D,E,R -> five new letters? Actually E and R are repeats? But we also introduce O,L,D? That's three new consonants? 

Similarly, BERET has B, E, R, E, T? So letters: B,E,R,T? With E repeated? So effectively testing B, E, R, T? and E? So not as efficient? Because we use a letter slot for E again? 

Alternatively, how about ""ENTER""? But that has E at position 1 and 4? And N,T? And R at 5? But E at position 1? That could be? Because we don't have information against E at position 1? Our feedback was only that E is not at position 5? Position 1 is open? But ENTER ends with R? position 5? But let's see: E at 1: not tested before? However, we also have R at 5? 

But ENTER? The word? Yes? 

But perhaps better is to avoid putting E at position 1 until we know? Because we have E? Already? And R? 

I think OLDER is a good candidate? Because:
- It doesn't start with R? Correct? OLDER starts with O?
- It has E at position 4? Not 5? 
- It has R at position 5? Which we haven't tried? 
- We introduce O, L, D? Which are common? 

So OLDER: O (position 1? new), L (2? new), D (3? new), E (4? we know E is present now at 4? must not be 5?), R (5? known letter? but new position?).

But we have confirmed E is in the word? So putting E at position 4? If it is correct? We get ✓? Or if it should be elsewhere? We get -? 

Similarly? R at 5? could be correct? 

Now? another word? ""CORED"": C,O,R,E,D? But that has R at position 3? and E at position 4? And ends with D? So E not at 5? acceptable? 

But let me see? which one gives better coverage: OLDER or similar? 

I also think about words that have R not at position 1? E not at position 5? and include common letters? 

For example? ""PROTE"": not a word? How about ""TRIED"": but T? R? I? no? we cannot use I because we ruled out I? TRIED has I? invalid? 

Another: ""CRONE"": C,R,O,N,E? but E at position 5? which is forbidden? Cannot guess? so if we guess CRONE? with E at 5? the feedback would immediately flag as wrong because E cannot be there? 

Similarly? words ending with E are bad? 

So? let's choose OLDER? 

What about ""RODEO"": but that has A? O? and sometimes Y? not? RODEO: R,O,D,E,O -> has O twice? and E at position 4? but we have R at position 1? we cannot put R at position 1? because our feedback said R not at 1? 

So R must be placed differently? 

Therefore? OLDER? Let's write it:

OLDER: 
Position 1: O? new 
Position 2: L? new 
Position 3: D? new 
Position 4: E? known? 
Position 5: R? known? 

But note: what if the secret word has R at position 5? But that might be? 

Alternatively? a word with R at position 2? E elsewhere? 

For example? ""TREAD"": but A is invalid? 

""URBED"": not common? 

""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T? E at position 3? and ends with T? so E not at 5? acceptable? but R is at position 2? Position indices: 1:C,2:R,3:E,4:P,5:T? 
Can we put R at position 2? Yes? because we only ruled out position 1? 

But CREPT? is that a word? Crept is the past tense of creep? yes? 

Similarly? CREPT: letters are C,R,E,P,T? all valid? no S,A,I? 

And we introduce C,R,E,P,T? but R and E are already known? So new letters: C,P,T? 
Compared to OLDER? OLDER introduces O,L,D? 

Both introduce three new letters? 

But CREPT has E at position 3? which may be less common? or more? 

I think OLDER is fine? but CREPT also? 

Another option: ""OPTER"": not common? 

""BLUER"": but has U? and ends with R? but B,L,U,E,R? U test? 

But perhaps we should avoid vowels? we already know about E? and A,I are out? so O and U are possible? 

I think both OLDER and CREPT are acceptable? 

I'll go with CREPT? wait? let's compare:

OLDER: if we guess OLDER and secret word has E elsewhere? then E at 4 would show -? and R at 5? similarly? 

But we want to test new letters? 

Another word? ""THREW"": T,H,R,E,W? has E at position 4? and R at position 3? 

THREW? T(1),H(2),R(3),E(4),W(5)? So E not at 5? okay? and R not at 1? okay? 

And letters: T,H,R,E,W? introduce T? H? W? plus R and E? 

That's three new letters? 

Similarly? 

But perhaps THREW is common? 

After consideration? I choose CREPT? because C,P,T? are common? and CREPT is a word? 

But CREPT: 
C(1)? new 
R(2)? known? but at new position? 
E(3)? known? at new position? 
P(4)? new 
T(5)? new 

This also? not at forbidden positions? 

Now? since E in RAISE was at position 5? and we said E is present? so it's likely in another position? we have many possibilities? 

I will go with CREPT. I think it covers with R at position 2? E at position 3? which weren't tested? 

So let's decide: CREPT? 

But RE is consecutive? might be less likely? but we don't know? 

Alternatively? another word? like ""CORBY"": not common? 

""GONER"": has E? ends with R? E is at position 4? O,K? but G O N E R? 
Position: 1:G?2:O?3:N?4:E?5:R -> E not at 5? acceptable? 
And letters: G?O?N?E?R? introduce G?O?N? 
But we have E at same position? 

The point is: both are valid? 

But after more thought: it might be better to cover more common? 
So OLDER? CREPT? THREW? BERET? 

I think CREPT or THREW? 

Let me pick THREW? 

Wait? no? because I don't know? 

Alternatively? let's choose a word containing R and E and other letters? I'll go with ""THREW""?

But THREW: T H R E W? 
T at 1? H at 2? R at 3? E at 4? W at 5? 
We introduce T,H,W? and R and E? 
E not at 5? good.

Similarly? we can consider ""DETER"": but has E twice? D? E? T? E? R? 
Letters: D?E?T?E?R? so D,T,R,E? 
But we already know E? and DETER? E at position 2 and 4? 
But it's a word? 

Perhaps THREW is better? 

I think THREW is a good choice? 

But what about vowel? we tested many? only E? and secret might have O? or U? 

In RAISE? we had vowels A? I? E? but only E is present? so the word contains E? and possibly no other vowels? or with consonants? 

For example? ""THREW"" has E? so it tests E? 

So? I'll use THREW? 

But note: THREW has no O? which is a vowel? we don't know if O is present? 

But we want to test common consonants? 

Another word? ""PROBE"": has O? not A? I? S? P R O B E? 
Letters: P?R?O?B?E? 
And E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5 because feedback already showed E is not at position 5? 
Thus? ""PROBE"" would have E at position 5? which is not allowed? so it's a bad guess? 

Therefore? avoid ending in E? 

So ""CRONE"" is bad? etc? 

So THREW? we can do? 

THREW:
Guessing THREW? 

<guess>THREW</guess> 

But let me finalize? 

I think it's fine? 

Let me go with ""THREW"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":
- R and E are present in the secret word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.
- A, I, and S are absent from the word.

The new guess must:
- Exclude A, I, and S.
- Include R (any position except 1) and E (any position except 5).
- Test new common consonants to gather more information.

Reasoning step by step:
1. **Avoid forbidden positions**: Since R cannot be in position 1 and E cannot be in position 5, the guess must place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
2. **Introduce new letters**: Choose high-frequency consonants like T, H, W, N, L, or D to maximize information gain. Vowels are limited (only O, U, or Y are possible besides E, as A and I are ruled out).
3. **Word selection**: ""THREW"" is suitable because:
   - It includes E (position 4) and R (position 3), avoiding the forbidden positions.
   - It introduces T, H, W—new letters for further testing.
   - It contains no A, I, or S.
   - It's a valid English word and helps position R and E in new slots.

This guess will help confirm positions for R and E while testing three new letters.

<guess>THREW</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- I(x): I is not in the word.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.

**Guess 2: THREW**
- T(x): T is not in the word.
- H(x): H is not in the word.
- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed R in position 3).
- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position. Position 4? Let's note: THREW positions are:
  - Pos1: T (x)
  - Pos2: H (x)
  - Pos3: R (-)
  - Pos4: E (✓)
  - Pos5: W (x)
So E is at position 4 and it is correct. Therefore, the secret word must have E in position 4.

Also, from THREW:
- R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we put R at position 3 and it got (-), meaning it is elsewhere).
- We now know that E is fixed at position 4.

**Consolidated Information:**
1. **Fixed so far:**
   - Position 4: Must be E.

2. **Present letters:**
   - R: must be in the word but not at position 1 (from RAISE) and not at position 3 (from THREW). So possible positions for R: 2 or 5.
   - E: confirmed at position 4.

3. **Absent letters:**
   - A, I, S, T, H, W.
   - From RAISE: A, I, S are absent.
   - From THREW: T, H, W are absent.

4. **Unknown letters:**
   - The secret word has 5 letters. We know position 4 is E, and R is present (somewhere else). So the other three letters are unknown but must not be the absent ones.
   - We have tested: R,A,I,S,E,T,H,W. So missing letters include B,C,D,F,G,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,Y, etc.

5. **Requirements for new guess:**
   - Must have E at position 4.
   - Must not contain any of the absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W.
   - Must include R if we haven't yet found its position? But we know R is present? Or is R already placed? No, we know R is present but not placed? Actually, from previous guesses, R must be in the word? And E is fixed at 4? Position 4 is occupied by E? So R must be in positions 2 or 5? We need to determine where R is? And also the remaining letters? And also we have no information about the other positions? 

But note: the secret word has E at position 4? and R present? and the rest? So positions 1,2,3,5 must be filled with letters that are not absent? But we don't know what they are? We have only negative information? 

The new guess must include E at position 4? and R must be in the word? in 2 or 5? but we don't know? So we need to put R at position 2 or 5 to test? And we need to fill the other positions with new letters? to test? 

Since we have limited guesses? we can try to include possible positions for R and test common other letters? 

Also? note: the secret word has exactly 5 letters? with E at position 4? R somewhere? and the other letters? 

But we know that R cannot be at position 1 or 3? so positions 2 or 5? 

So? for the new guess? we must have E at position 4? and we can place R at either 2 or 5? to see? 

But we also want to test new letters? 

Let me propose words? 

Constraints: 
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- The word cannot have A, I, S, T, H, W.
- Must include R (since it's present? unless? but feedback says R is present? so yes? if we omit R? it won't satisfy? So yes? must include R) in a position other than 1 and 3? but in the guess? we can put R at 2 or 5? 

So possible words: 

List of 5-letter words with E at position 4? and that have R? and without A,I,S,T,H,W? 

Structure: 
Pos1: ? 
Pos2: ? or R? 
Pos3: ? 
Pos4: E 
Pos5: ? or R? (if R is not at Pos2? then at Pos5? or if we put R at Pos2? we can test that)

Let me think of words:

Option 1: Put R at position 2? 
Format: letter at1? R? letter at3? E? letter at5? 
For example: C R ? E ? 

Words: 
- ""CRUEL"": but has U? E? L? 
  - But position5: L?
  - But is L okay? We haven't tested L? and CRUEL: C,R,U,E,L -> 
  - Valid? E at4? 
  - But U and L are new? 
  - However, does it contain absent letters? A,I,S,T,H,W? no? T,H,W are absent? T is in absent? but CRUEL has no T,H,W? So okay? 

But wait? CRUEL? position3 is U? position5 is L? 

But we also need to verify if it contains R? at position2? yes? 

Now? what if R is not at position2? What if R is at position5? Then CRUEL would put R at2? which might be wrong? 

We could instead put R at position5? to test? 

Another word: with R at position5? Format: ? ? ? E R? 
For example: ""FLEER"": but has F? L? E? E? R? 
But FL E E R? positions: 
1:F? 2:L? 3:E? 4:E? but position4 must be E? but in FLEER? position4 would be E? and position5:R? 
But note: FLEER? isn't a common word? 
Also? we tested E? and we have E at position3? which we don't know? 

Actually? FLEER? is a word? but let's look for common words? 

Better: ""QUEER"": Q?U?E?E?R? but Q and U at positions 1 and 2? and E at position3? which we don't care? E at position4? and R at5? 

Also? QUEER has E twice? 
But? we don't know about duplicate? 

Similarly? ""PLIER"": but has I? ruled out? 

""AUDIO"": ruled out? 

So? words with R at5: 
Examples: ""POWER"": but has W? W is absent? 
""BEVER"": not a word? 
""DEMUR"": D?E?M?U?R -> positions: D at1? E at2? but position4 must be E? so not? 

Format for R at5: we need position4 to be E? and position5 to be R? So words ending with ""ER"": 
Pattern: ? ? ? E R? 

Common words: 
- ""CIDER"": C,I,D? I is absent? invalid? 
- ""DINER"": has I? invalid? 
- ""FIGHTER"": too long? 
- ""LIKER"": has I? 
- ""MOWER"": has W? 
- ""NUDER"": not common? 
- ""RACER"": has A? invalid? 
- ""RAMEN"": not 5? 
- ""REPER"": not word? 
- ""RIPER"": has I? 
- ""ROGER"": O? G? E? R? but positions: R at1? O at2? G at3? E at4? R at5? 
But in ROGER? position1: R? but we cannot put R at position1? because we know R is not at position1? from RAISE? 
So ROGER is invalid? because it has R at1? 

Similarly? words starting with R are invalid? 

So words ending with ER? without absent letters? avoiding A,I,S,T,H,W? and not starting with R? 

For example: ""BEEFY"": not ends with ER? 
""CYBER"": but positions: 
If C Y B E R? positions: E at4? R at5? 
And C?Y?B? are new? 
And CYBER? word? 

CYBER: 
- C(1)? new
- Y(2)? new? and vowel or consonant? 
- B(3)? new
- E(4)? fixed
- R(5)? which we want to test? possible R at position5? 

Also? no absent letters? 

But note? the secret word? must have E at position4? and R? which CYBER places R at5? 

Alternatively? ""GONER"": G? O? N? E? R? 
Positions: G(1)? O(2)? N(3)? E(4)? R(5)? 
Similarly? not absent?

And I? S? etc? no? 

Similarly? ""HOMER"": H is absent? from THREW? H(x)? so cannot have H? 

Therefore? CYBER? GONER? etc? 

But why not? 

Also? CYBER? GONER introduce new letters? 

Let's go back: I need to guess a word that:

- Position 4: E
- Must include R? at position 2 or 5? 
- And other letters not in absent set? 

But also? we can put R at multiple positions? or just one? Since the secret has R exactly once? or possibly twice? but we don't know? Each guess is interpreted individually? 

In CYBER? R is only at position5? 

Similarly? for position2? Like CRUEL? 

Now? the choice: should I put R at position2 or position5? 

Since we know R cannot be at position1 or 3? it must be at position2 or position5? 

So if I put R at position2 in this guess? and it's correct? we get ✓? If not? then R must be at position5? because those are the only options? 

Similarly? if I put R at position5 and it's wrong? then we must put R at position2? 

So we can decide? 

But also? we can cover both? but with one guess? 

For example? if we put R at position2? and also test new letters? 

Or? we can put R at position5? 

But I want to maximize information about other letters? 

Perhaps? put R at position2? and include common new letters? 

So guess: ? R ? E ? 

Where positions 1,3,5 are new letters? 

Similarly? avoid absent letters? 

Or if we put R at position5? pattern: ? ? ? E R? 

But then positions 1,2,3 need to be filled? 

But note? in the second pattern? position3 is tested? 

From THREW? position3: R? got (-)? meaning the correct R is not at position3? but that doesn't tell us what letter is actually at position3? 

So we need to guess letters for positions 1,2,3? 

The same for positions 1,2,5? 

But we have E fixed at4? so position3 must be a letter? 

Both scenarios are symmetric? 

So let me choose to put R at position2? Then we can test:

For positions 1,3,5 with new letters? and R at2? E at4? 

Examples: 
- ""CRUEL"": C at1? R at2? U at3? E at4? L at5? 
  Letters: C,R,U,E,L? All new except R and E? 
  Absent letters? None? So okay? 

Another: ""DRIED"": D? R? I? E? D? But contains I? absent? invalid? 

""FREED"": F? R? E? E? D? But E twice? and E at position3? but position3? and position4:E? 
But note? position3 and position4 are different? 
FREED: 
1: F? 
2: R? 
3: E? But wait? we put E at position3? Now? from feedback? we know E is at position4? but we don't know about E elsewhere? 
If the secret word has only one E? then putting E at position3 would be useless? if it's not present? 
But FREED has E at position3? That's okay? 
But also? D at position5? 
But note? the secret word has E at position4? and we don't know if there are other E? 
So it could be? 
Also? FREED? does it contain S?A?I? no? But T?H?W? no? so okay? 
But E at position3: if there is no E at position3? it would show x? because E is present? so we would know? 

But let's focus? 
I think CRUEL is a valid word? and introduces C?U?L? 

Similarly? ""GRUEL"": G?R?U?E?L? same as CRUEL? 
Also valid? 

But either? 

I can also use ""PROWL"": but no? position4 must be E? 

Not: ""BRULE"": perhaps not common? 

So perhaps CRUEL or GRUEL? 

But GRUEL is more common? meaning? 

Alternatively? ""QUEEN"": Q?U?E?E?N? but E at position4? but position3 also E? 
And no R? we must include R? because R is present? we cannot omit R? 
So QUEEN does not contain R? invalid? 

Another word: ""CREWL"": not a word? 

So? CRUEL? 

But CRUEL? L at position5? 

Now? similarly? we can put R at position5? with GONER? etc? 

But let's choose putting R at position2? because position5 we haven't tested? and position2 we might need to confirm? 

Another word: ""DETER"": D?E?T?E?R? but T is absent? so cannot? because THREW said T(x). 

""PETER"": P?E?T?E?R? T absent? 

""BEVER"": not word? 

So back to? 

I think ""CRUEL"" or ""GRUEL"" or ""PRUDE"": PRUDE? P?R?U?D?E? positions: 
1:P? 
2:R? 
3:U? 
4:E? 
5:D -> D? 
But E at position4? 
And no absent letters? 
PRUDE is a valid word? 

So ""PRUDE"": P at1? R at2? U at3? D at5? 

Also? introduces P?R?U?D?E? but R and E known? 

Similarly? letters P,U,D? new? 

PRUDE vs CRUEL? 

PRUDE doesn't have C or L? 

But equally good? 

I'll choose ""PRUDE"" as the guess? 

But wait? both are okay? 

Alternatively? think about the most common letters: 
The remaining common consonants: B?C?D?F?G?L?M?N?O?P?Q?U?V?Y? 

So CRUEL: C,U?L? 
PRUDE: P?U?D? 

Perhaps similar? 

But let me try PRUDE? 

Why not? 

So? new guess: PRUDE? with E at4? R at2? 

In the feedback? for R? since we put R at position2? we will get: 
- If R is correct at2? then ✓ for R? 
- If R is in the word but not at2? then it must be at position5? therefore we get - for R? meaning R is misplaced? 

Similarly? for E? we already know E at4 is correct? so it will be ✓? 

And we'll learn about P? U? D? 

Similarly with other words? 

But also? note? if PRUDE? position3: U? which might be? 

So? let me use PRUDE? 

But one more thought: the secret word might have U? but we don't know? 

Also? GONER? for putting R at5? 

But let's not overcomplicate? I think PRUDE is fine? 

So? guess: ""PRUDE""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R is present but not pos 1, A/I/S absent, E present but not pos 5.
- **Guess 2 (THREW)**: T/H/W absent, R present but not pos 3, E is in the word and CORRECT at pos 4.

**Deductions:**
- E is fixed at position 4 in the secret word.
- R must be present but cannot be in positions 1 or 3, leaving only positions 2 or 5 possible.
- Absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W.
- The new guess must:
  - Have E in position 4.
  - Include R (in position 2 or 5 to test its location).
  - Exclude absent letters (A/I/S/T/H/W).
  - Test new common consonants for positions 1, 3, and 5.

**Word Choice Reasoning:**  
""PRUDE"" is selected because:
- Position 4: E (correct placement).
- Position 2: R (tests if R belongs here; feedback will indicate if correct or if R is in position 5).
- Positions 1, 3, 5: P, U, D (new high-frequency letters to probe).
- No absent letters and valid English word.

This guess efficiently narrows R's position (2 or 5) while testing three new letters.

<guess>PRUDE</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)
Guess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the following feedback history:

Guess 1: RAISE
- R: present but not in position 1 (so R is in the word, but not at index 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present but not in position 5 (so E is in the word, but not at index 5)

Guess 2: THREW
- T: absent
- H: absent
- R: present but not in position 3 (so R is in the word, but not at index 3)
- E: correct at position 4 (so the secret word has E at position 4)
- W: absent

Guess 3: PRUDE
- P: absent
- R: present but not in position 2 (so R is in the word, but not at index 2)
- U: absent
- D: absent
- E: present but not in position 4? Wait, this is confusing because in PRUDE, E is at position 4, but the feedback says E(-) meaning it is present but not in the correct position? But we already know from guess 2 that E is correct at position 4.

This is a contradiction. Let me reexamine:

In guess 2 (THREW), we had E at position 4 marked as correct (✓). That means the secret word has E at position 4.

In guess 3 (PRUDE), we also put E at position 4. Since the secret word has E at position 4, the feedback for E in PRUDE should be ✓, not (-). But the feedback says E(-), which would mean that E is in the word but not at position 4. This contradicts the previous feedback.

There must be a misunderstanding. Let me clarify the feedback format.

The feedback for PRUDE: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)

But E is at position 4 in PRUDE. If the secret word has E at position 4, then E should be marked as correct (✓), not (-). The (-) for E in PRUDE would imply that E is not at position 4 in the secret word? But that can't be because we already have E(✓) at position 4 from THREW.

This suggests an error in the feedback or in our understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is incorrect? Or maybe the secret word has only one E? But in THREW, E was at position 4 and correct, so it must be there.

Another possibility: the feedback for PRUDE's E is a mistake? But let's assume the feedback is correct.

Wait, the feedback for PRUDE: E(-) means that E is in the word but not at position 4? But that contradicts the fact that we have E at position 4 from THREW.

Unless... the secret word has multiple E's? For example, if the secret word has E at position 4 and another E elsewhere, then in PRUDE, we have E at position 4 which is correct, so it should be ✓, and if there is another E, then the E in PRUDE at position 4 would still be ✓ because it's the correct letter in the correct position.

The feedback symbol ✓ means correct letter and correct position, regardless of duplicates.

So if the secret word has E at position 4, then any guess that has E at position 4 must get a ✓ for that position.

Therefore, the feedback for E in PRUDE should be ✓, not (-). But it's given as (-), which is inconsistent.

This implies that the secret word does not have E at position 4? But that contradicts guess 2's feedback.

Perhaps I misremembered the position? Let's list the positions:

THREW: positions
1: T
2: H
3: R
4: E (marked ✓)
5: W

So E is at position 4 and correct.

PRUDE: positions
1: P
2: R
3: U
4: E
5: D

Feedback for PRUDE: P(x), R(-), U(x), D(x), E(-)

E at position 4 is marked as (-), meaning present but not at position 4? But that can't be if position 4 is E in the secret word.

Unless the feedback for E in PRUDE is for the letter E, but since it's at position 4 and the secret has E at position 4, it should be ✓.

This is a problem. Perhaps there is a misunderstanding of the feedback format.

Let me re-read the initial rules:

""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.""

In the case of PRUDE, if the secret word has E at position 4, then the E in position 4 of the guess must be ✓. But the feedback says E(-), which is wrong position. This is inconsistent.

Perhaps the secret word does not have E at position 4? But guess 2 said E(✓) at position 4.

Another idea: maybe the feedback for guess 2 was for THREW, and the secret word changed? But no, it's the same secret word.

Perhaps I have a bug in the interpretation.

Let's look at the feedback string for guess 3: ""P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)""

For E, it's (-), which means the letter E is in the word but not at position 4. But from guess 2, we know E is at position 4. Contradiction.

Unless in guess 2, the E was not at position 4? But the feedback said E(✓) for position 4.

I think there might be a mistake in the feedback provided, or in my reasoning.

Perhaps the position indexing is off? But I think it's standard.

Another possibility: in guess 2, THREW, the E was at position 4 and marked ✓, so that's fixed.

In guess 3, PRUDE, we have E at position 4, so it should be ✓. But the feedback says E(-), which is impossible.

Therefore, I must conclude that the feedback for E in PRUDE is incorrect as reported, or there is a misunderstanding.

But let's assume the feedback is correct and reexamine guess 2.

Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)

The feedback is given as ""E(✓)"", which should mean that the letter in the position of E in THREW (which is position 4) is correct.

Similarly, for PRUDE, ""E(-)"" means that the letter E in position 4 of PRUDE is not correct, but present elsewhere.

This is a direct contradiction.

Unless the secret word has two E's? Let's consider that.

Suppose the secret word has two E's. In THREW, we have E at position 4, which is one of the E's, so it gets ✓. In PRUDE, we have E at position 4, but if the secret word has E at position 4, it should be ✓. If the secret word has E at position 4, then PRUDE's E at 4 must be ✓.

The only way for PRUDE's E to be (-) is if the secret word has an E, but not at position 4. But that contradicts the ✓ from THREW.

Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the feedback for guess 3 is misreported or there is an error.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 2 was not E(✓) but something else? But it's given as E(✓).

Let's read the user's message: ""Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)""

Yes, E(✓).

For guess 3: ""Guess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)""

E(-).

This is inconsistent.

Perhaps the positions are 1-based, but maybe the feedback is per letter without position? But the feedback is for each letter in order.

I think I have to accept the feedback as given and assume that the secret word does not have E at position 4, which means the feedback for guess 2 was misinterpreted.

But that doesn't make sense.

Another idea: in guess 2, the feedback ""E(✓)"" might mean that E is in the word and in some position, but not necessarily position 4? No, the feedback is for the specific position.

The feedback is given for each letter in the order of the guess, so for THREW, the fourth letter E is correct.

Similarly for PRUDE, the fourth letter E is not correct, but E is in the word elsewhere.

This is impossible.

Unless the secret word changed, but it's the same game.

I think there might be a typo in the feedback for guess 3. Perhaps it's not E(-) but E(✓)? Or something else.

But I have to work with what's given.

Perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is for the letter, but since it's the same as position 4, it should be ✓.

I'm stuck.

Let's ignore the contradiction for a moment and list what we know.

From guess 1:
- R is in the word, not at position 1.
- A, I, S are absent.
- E is in the word, not at position 5.

From guess 2:
- T, H, W are absent.
- R is in the word, not at position 3.
- E is in the word and at position 4? But then from guess 3, E at position 4 is not correct, so let's not assume.

From guess 2 feedback E(✓), we must have E at position 4.

From guess 3 feedback E(-), we have that E is in the word but not at position 4.

Contradiction.

Perhaps the feedback for guess 3 is ""E(✓)"" but written as ""E(-)"" by mistake? That might be the case.

Or perhaps in the context, the E in PRUDE is at position 4, and if it's (-), it means that the secret word has E, but not at position 4, which contradicts.

I think I have to assume that the feedback for guess 3 is incorrect or that there's a misunderstanding of the position.

Another possibility: the feedback for PRUDE is for the letters, not positions? But the format is per position.

Let's read the initial example: ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)"" so it's for each letter in order.

Similarly, for PRUDE, ""P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)"" means:
- P at position 1: absent
- R at position 2: present but wrong position
- U at position 3: absent
- D at position 4: absent? Wait, no, D is at position 5? Let's see:

PRUDE: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: R
Position 3: U
Position 4: E
Position 5: D

Feedback: P(x) for position 1, R(-) for position 2, U(x) for position 3, D(x) for position 5? But the feedback says ""D(x) E(-)"", so D(x) is for position 5, and E(-) for position 4.

E at position 4 is marked as (-), meaning present but not at position 4.

But from guess 2, position 4 is E and correct.

This is the contradiction.

Unless in guess 2, the E was not at position 4? But it was.

I think I have to proceed by ignoring the E feedback from guess 3 or something.

Perhaps the secret word has only one E, and in guess 2, E at position 4 was correct, so in guess 3, E at position 4 should be correct, so the feedback must be E(✓), but it's given as E(-), so maybe it's a typo and it's E(✓).

Otherwise, the game is inconsistent.

For the sake of progressing, I will assume that the feedback for E in PRUDE is a mistake and it should be E(✓), because of the previous feedback.

Perhaps the user meant E(✓) but typed E(-) by error.

Because otherwise, it's impossible.

So I'll assume that for PRUDE, E should be E(✓), and the feedback is misstated.

So corrected feedback for PRUDE: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(✓)

Then it makes sense.

Because E at position 4 is correct.

Then R at position 2 is present but not at 2, so R is not at position 2.

P, U, D are absent.

So let's assume that.

Otherwise, we can't proceed.

So from now on, I'll assume the feedback for E in PRUDE is ✓.

So:

Guess 3: PRUDE feedback: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(✓)

Then:

- P: absent
- R: present but not at position 2 (so R not at 2)
- U: absent
- D: absent
- E: correct at position 4

Now, from previous:

- R is present, not at position 1 (from RAISE), not at position 3 (from THREW), not at position 2 (from PRUDE), so R must be at position 5.

Positions are 1,2,3,4,5.

R cannot be at 1,2,3, so only position 5 left.

Also, E is at position 4.

Absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D.

Present letters: R, E, and three others.

R must be at position 5.

So secret word: _ _ _ E R

Positions: 1,2,3 are unknown, 4:E, 5:R.

Letters to fill: three letters, not in absent set.

Absent: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D

So available letters: B,C,F,G,L,M,N,O,Q,V,Y,Z, etc. But common letters.

We need to guess a word of the form _ _ _ E R, with the first three letters not absent.

New guess must have E at 4, R at 5, and positions 1,2,3 with new letters.

For example, ""BOXER"", but X might not be common.

""BOXER"": B,O,X,E,R

Check absent: B not absent, O not absent, X not tested, E and R known.

But X is less common.

""JOKER"": J,O,K,E,R

J and K not tested.

But let's think of common letters.

Since we have few guesses left, we can try to cover common letters.

Available common consonants: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, Y

Vowels: O, and sometimes Y.

But we have position 1,2,3 to fill.

For example, ""LONER"": L,O,N,E,R

But N is common.

LONER: positions 1:L, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R

Check absent: L not absent, O not absent, N not absent.

Similarly, ""GONER"": G,O,N,E,R

G not absent.

But G was not tested.

Another: ""MINER"": but M not absent, but I is absent, so invalid.

I is absent, so no.

""COVER"": C,O,V,E,R

C, O, V not absent.

V is less common.

""BOXER"" is a word.

But let's list possible words: _ _ _ E R

With the first three letters from: B,C,F,G,L,M,N,O,Q,V,Y

Common words: 
- LOVER: L,O,V,E,R -> V is not common, but valid.
- MOWER: but W is absent.
- POWER: W absent.
- HOMER: H absent.
- So not.

""BAKER"": B,A,K,E,R but A absent.

A is absent.

""MAKER"": A absent.

""RACER"": A absent.

So no A.

""FEWER"": F,E,W,E,R but W absent and E repeated.

W absent.

""JEWEL"": not E R ending.

So perhaps ""BOXER"", ""JOKER"", ""CODER"" but D absent.

D is absent from PRUDE feedback.

D(x) so absent.

So no D.

""COVER"" is good.

Or ""LOVER"".

But let's choose ""COVER"": C,O,V,E,R

Introduces C,O,V.

But V is not very common, but it's a word.

""COMER"": C,O,M,E,R

M not absent.

""COMER"" is a word.

Similarly, ""CORER"": but O at position 2, R at position 3? But R is at position 5, and we have only one R? But ""CORER"" has two R's? C,O,R,E,R -> positions: 1:C,2:O,3:R,4:E,5:R

But we have R at position 3 and 5. But from feedback, R is present, but we don't know about duplicates.

In this case, if we guess ""CORER"", and secret has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked differently.

But it's messy.

Better to avoid duplicates for now.

So ""COMER"": C,O,M,E,R

Positions: 1:C,2:O,3:M,4:E,5:R

All new letters except E and R.

And C,O,M not absent.

Similarly, ""COVER"" has V.

I think ""COMER"" is better.

But ""COMER"" is a word? It means one who comes, like in ""newcomer"", but as a standalone, it might be accepted.

Another common word: ""BOXER"" or ""JOKER"".

""JOKER"" is common.

J is not absent.

So let's go with ""JOKER"".

Guess: JOKER

But J is not very common, but it's a valid guess.

To maximize information, we can choose a word with common letters.

Available common letters: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, O, Y

For example, ""LONER"": L,O,N,E,R

L, O, N are common.

Similarly, ""GONER"": G,O,N,E,R

G and N common.

Or ""BONER"": B,O,N,E,R - also a word.

But let's choose ""LONER"".

So new guess: LONER

Positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R

We will get feedback on L, O, N.

If any are correct or present.

But since we have to guess, and we know E and R are fixed.

So <guess>LONER</guess>

But we have the contradiction issue.

Perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is correct, and we have to rethink.

But I think for the sake of continuing, I'll go with LONER.

So in the response, I'll assume the feedback for E in PRUDE is E(✓) implicitly.

So summary for new guess:

Secret word has E at 4, R at 5, and positions 1,2,3 to be guessed.

Absent letters: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D

So guess ""LONER"" to test L, O, N.

<guess>LONER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:
     - R: Present but not in position 1.
     - A, I, S: Absent.
     - E: Present but not in position 5.
   - **Guess 2 (THREW)**:
     - T, H, W: Absent.
     - R: Present but not in position 3.
     - E: Correct at position 4 (secret word has E in position 4).
   - **Guess 3 (PRUDE)**:
     - P, U, D: Absent.
     - R: Present but not in position 2.
     - E: Feedback is ""E(-)"", but this conflicts with Guess 2's ""E(✓)"" at position 4. After re-evaluating, the feedback for E in PRUDE must be inconsistent due to a possible error, as E cannot be both correct at position 4 (from THREW) and misplaced in the same position (PRUDE). For consistency, I'll treat E as correct at position 4, as established by Guess 2.

2. **Key Deductions**:
   - **E is fixed at position 4**: Confirmed by Guess 2's feedback.
   - **R must be at position 5**: 
     - R is present but cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE), position 3 (from THREW), or position 2 (from PRUDE). The only remaining position is 5.
   - **Absent letters**: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D (from all feedback).
   - **Secret word structure**: The secret word is `_ _ _ E R`, with positions 1, 2, and 3 unknown.
   - **Available letters**: Must be from the remaining letters not absent (B, C, F, G, L, M, N, O, Q, V, Y, etc.). Common consonants like B, C, F, G, L, M, N and vowels like O, Y are prioritized for information gain.

3. **Strategy for New Guess**:
   - The new guess must have E at position 4 and R at position 5 to confirm R's placement.
   - Positions 1, 2, and 3 should test new high-frequency letters to maximize information (e.g., L, O, N, M, C).
   - Avoid absent letters and reuse of known letters (only E and R are confirmed present).
   - ""LONER"" is chosen because:
     - Structure: `L O N E R` (E at 4, R at 5).
     - Tests L (position 1), O (position 2), and N (position 3)—all common letters not yet tested.
     - Valid English word, fitting the pattern `_ _ _ E R`.

4. **Expected Outcomes**:
   - If L, O, or N are correct, we narrow down the secret word quickly.
   - If all are absent, we eliminate three common letters and focus on other options (e.g., C, M, G).

<guess>LONER</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)
Guess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)
Guess 4: LONER -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from four guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R: present, wrong position (not position 1)
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present, wrong position (not position 5)

**Guess 2: THREW**
- T: absent
- H: absent
- R: present, wrong position (not position 3)
- E: correct at position 4
- W: absent

**Guess 3: PRUDE**
- P: absent
- R: present, wrong position (not position 2)
- U: absent
- D: absent
- E: present, wrong position (note: from Guess 2, E is known to be at position 4, but feedback here shows E(-), which might be a mistake. However, we proceed with the data given.)

**Guess 4: LONER**
- L: absent
- O: correct at position 2
- N: absent
- E: correct at position 4
- R: correct at position 5

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed Positions**:
   - Position 2: O (from LONER, O(✓))
   - Position 4: E (from THREW and LONER)
   - Position 5: R (from LONER, R(✓))

2. **R's Position is Now Known**: 
   - From LONER, R is correct at position 5. This aligns with previous deductions that R cannot be at position 1, 2, or 3. Position 5 is confirmed.
   - Also, since R is now at position 5, previous ""R(-)"" feedback makes sense as it was not in the correct position in earlier guesses.

3. **E's Position**:
   - Position 4 is confirmed correct for E (from Guess 2 and Guess 4).
   - In Guess 3 (PRUDE), E was guessed at position 4 but given feedback E(-), which contradicts E being always at position 4. For consistency, we must accept that the secret word has E at position 4, so there might have been an error in the feedback for Guess 3. We'll proceed with E at position 4 being fixed.

4. **O's Position**:
   - Position 2 is O (from Guess 4).

5. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all guesses: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D, L, N
   - List: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D, L, N

6. **Present Letters**:
   - R, E, O (O is now fixed at position 2)
   - Since the word has only one more letter (at position 1 and 3), but we have position 3 unknown and position 1 unknown.
   - We also have E and R fixed, and O fixed at position 2.

### Secret Word Structure:
- Position 1: Unknown letter (not absent)
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Position 3: Unknown letter (not absent)
- Position 4: E (fixed)
- Position 5: R (fixed)

So the word is `_ O _ E R`.

- We need to find two letters: one for position 1 and one for position 3.
- These letters must not be from the absent set: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D,L,N.

### Available Letters:
- Possible letters: English letters except absent ones. Common consonants: B, C, F, G, M, Q, V, Y, etc.

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We must guess a word that fits `_ O _ E R`, inserting letters not absent.
- We have two unknown positions, so we can test common letters.
- Since we have limited guesses (this is our fifth guess), we want to maximize information.

### Choosing the Word:
- Pattern: `X O Y E R` where X and Y are letters from available set.
- We need to select meaningful words.
- Examples: 
  - ""COVER"": C O V E R → position 1=C, position 3=V
  - ""CODER"" (but D is absent, so invalid)
  - ""COMER"": C O M E R → position 3=M
  - ""BOXER"": B O X E R → position 1=B, position 3=X
  - ""JOKER"": J O K E R → position 1=J, position 3=K
  - However, note that X and K are less common.

- To cover more common letters, we might choose ""COMER"" or ""COVER"".
- But ""COVER"" has V which is less common. 
- Another option: ""BOYER"" (proper name) or ""BOGER"" (less common).
- Better: ""GONER"" but we know O and N? N is absent? From Guess 4: N is absent, so invalid.

We have N absent from LONER, so position 3 cannot be N.

Possible words:
- ""COMER"" (if accepted)
- ""COGER"" (not common)
- ""COWER"": but W is absent.

Alternatively, ""FOREX"" — not matching pattern.

""Foyer"": not 5 letters? ""Foyer"" is 5 letters: F-O-Y-E-R.
Yes, ""FOYER"": F O Y E R → F at position 1, Y at position 3.

Similarly, ""COYER"": C O Y E R.

Both are words.

We can try ""FOYER"" to test F and Y.

But Y is a consonant/vowel and less common.

Another word: ""COVER"" is good, testing C and V.

With two unknowns, we can also choose a word with repeated letters, but unnecessary.

Given the fixes, and that we have only position 1 and 3 unknown, we can make a guess that uses common letters.

Select ""COVER"": 
- C and V are not tested yet.
- If we get feedback, we will know if they are or aren't.

But a better word might be ""BOXER"" since B and X?

Alternatively, ""JOKER"" uses J and K — not ideal.

Choose ""COMER"" if we think M is likely? But M wasn't tested.

Since we have two unknowns and only one guess (we can guess and then correct next), but with this pattern, there might be multiple options.

Let's list possible common words matching `_ O _ E R`:
- COVER (C and V)
- COMER (C and M)
- BOXER (B and X)
- FOYER (F and Y)
- CORKER — has K? and R at position 3? But we have R at position 5, and position 3: K? C O K E R? ""Coker"" — C O K E R? But K is in position 3.
- Similarly, ""COPER"": C O P E R — but P is absent from Guess 3.

P is absent, so can't be.

Another: ""GONER"" — N absent.

So available:
- COVER: C, O, V, E, R
- COMER: C, O, M, E, R
- BOXER: B, O, X, E, R
- FOYER: F, O, Y, E, R
- etc.

We can choose ""COVER"" assuming it's a valid guess.

### Feedback Prediction:
- If we guess ""COVER"", and the secret is ""COVER"", we win.
- If not, we get information on C and V.

But with the structure, the only other options might be limited.

### Recommendation:
Guess ""COVER"" to test C and V.

If not that, then next would be ""COMER"", but we have to pick one.

To maximize common letters, ""COMER"" uses M (more common than V or X), so I'll go with ""COMER"".

<guess>COMER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
From the feedback:
- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:
  - R is present but not at pos 1.
  - A, I, S absent.
  - E is present but not at pos 5.
- **Guess 2 (THREW)**:
  - T, H, W absent.
  - R present but not at pos 3.
  - E is **fixed at position 4** (✓).
- **Guess 3 (PRUDE)**:
  - P, U, D absent.
  - R present but not at pos 2.
  - E feedback ""-"" conflicts with Guess 2's ✓ at pos 4; this is resolved by prioritizing the E(✓) confirmation from Guess 2 and Guess 4.
- **Guess 4 (LONER)**:
  - L, N absent.
  - O is **fixed at position 2** (✓).
  - E is ***confirmed fixed at position 4*** (✓).
  - R is **fixed at position 5** (✓).

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed positions**:
   - Position 2: O (from Guess 4).
   - Position 4: E (from Guess 2 and Guess 4).
   - Position 5: R (from Guess 4).
2. **Absent letters**: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D, L, N.
3. **Secret word structure**: `_ O _ E R`:
   - Position 1 and 3 must be filled with remaining non-absent letters (common: B, C, F, G, M, V, Y).
4. **Strategy**:
   - Position 1 and 3 are unknown. Use a word that tests common consonants at these positions.
   - ""COMER"" is chosen:
     - Tests C (position 1) and M (position 3).
     - Valid 5-letter word matching `_ O _ E R`.
     - C and M are high-frequency letters not tested before.

If ""COMER"" is incorrect, feedback will eliminate C/M and narrow options to words like ""COVER"", ""FOYER"", or ""BOXER"".

It\'s a strong opening word because it includes three vowels (A, I, E) and two common consonants (R, S), maximizing the chance of getting feedback about frequent letters.

Note: In RAISE, E is the fifth letter, so the feedback E(-) means E is in the word but not in the fifth position.\n\nImportant deductions:\n1. The letters A, I, S are ABSENT from the secret word. So we must avoid words containing A, I, or S.\n2. R and E are present in the word, but:\n   - R is not in position 1 (where we guessed it).\n   - E is not in position 5 (where we guessed it).\n\nWe know the secret word contains R and E, but not A, I, S.\n\nSince there are no other letters reported, the word must consist of letters other than A, I, S. But note: we might have missed letters that weren\'t in RAISE.\n\nWe need to form a new guess that:\n- Excludes A, I, S.\n- Includes R and E (since they are present).\n- Places R not in position 1 and E not in position 5.\n\nAdditionally, we want to test new common letters to get more information.\n\nCommon consonants left: B, C, D, F, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.\n\nWe also consider that perhaps the word has double letters? But since we got only two ""presents"" (R and E) and three absent (A,I,S), the word might have other letters we haven\'t tested.\n\nWe have 6 tries, so we need to cover more ground.\n\nIdea: Use a word that has R and E in positions other than 1 and 5, and include three new common consonants.\n\nBut note: position matters. We know R can\'t be first, E can\'t be last.\n\nPossible positions for R: 2,3,4,5 (or possibly 1? no, because we got R(-) meaning it\'s misplaced, so not position 1). Similarly, E can be in 1,2,3,4.\n\nAlso, since R and E are both in the word, we can try to put them in positions we haven\'t ruled out.\n\nFor example, if we put R in position 2, but we don\'t know if that\'s correct. We want to minimize conflicts.\n\nLet\'s think of words without A,I,S, and containing R and E.\n\nFirst, avoid A,I,S.\n\nConsider vowels: we know the word does not contain A or I, so the vowels can only be E (which we have), O, U, and sometimes Y.\n\nWe already know E is in the word. What other vowels might be present? Let\'s try to include O and U to test.\n\nSome words that come to mind:\n\nOption: PRONE? But P is new and O is new. However, PRONE: \n- P, R, O, N, E\nBut E is in position 5? We can\'t put E in position 5 because our feedback said E is not in position 5. But PRONE puts E in position 5 -> that\'s invalid. We must avoid putting E at the end.\n\nOption: RENEW? But has E twice? Also, S? No, avoid S. RENEW has double E? But not in the database necessarily.\n\nList of words with R and E, excluding A,I,S:\n\nWe can try words like:\n- BERGY: but not a common word? \n- Other words: CLEAR? But CLEAR has A -> invalid because A is ruled out.\n\nLet me think: \n- ""OLDER"": O,L,D,E,R -> letters: O,L,D,E,R -> contains R and E, and E not at end? O L D E R -> E is at position 4? Position indices: 1:O, 2:L, 3:D, 4:E, 5:R -> E is at 4 and R at 5. But we don\'t know about R position? We know R cannot be at position 1, but position 5 is okay? Similarly, E cannot be at position 5? Our feedback E(-) meant it was present but not in position 5. So in this case, position 4 is okay for E? Yes, and R at 5? We haven\'t ruled out R at 5? The feedback R(-) said R is not at position 1? So position 5 may be possible? Also, we haven\'t tested R at 5.\n\nBut note: in OLDER, E is at 4 and R at 5. Since E is not at 5, that\'s okay. R at 5: we don\'t have information against that.\n\nAlternatively, ""RECUT"": R,E,C,U,T -> R at 1? Can we put R at first? Our feedback said R is not in position 1? Since RAISE had R at first and got (-), meaning R is in the word but not position 1. Therefore, we cannot put R at position 1 again.\n\nSo in RECUT, if we put it as first guess with R at 1, it would violate? So avoid words starting with R.\n\nSimilarly, E cannot be at position 5. So our guess must not start with R and not end with E.\n\nSo back to OLDER: \n- It ends with R? Position 5: R is the fifth letter? We can do that? Because R not at position 1 is allowed at position 5?\n\nBut note: O L D E R -> positions:\n1: O (new)\n2: L (new)\n3: D (new)\n4: E (which we know is present, but we are putting at 4 -> not 5, so okay)\n5: R (which we know is present? But we don\'t know about position 5? We only know R is not at position 1? Position 5 could be okay? But we haven\'t guessed R at 5 yet? So it might be correct or not? We\'ll get feedback.)\n\nAlso, all letters are new except R and E? We are introducing O, L, D, and R and E? Actually we are retesting E? But that\'s fine.\n\nBut the word must have exactly the letters including R and E? And others? OLDER seems a valid word? It means someone who is old.\n\nBut let me confirm: OLDER is an English word, yes.\n\nOther options: \n- ""BERET"": has E twice? But that\'s okay? But BERET: B E R E T -> positions: 1:B, 2:E, 3:R, 4:E, 5:T -> E at position 2 and 4? So we can test E? But the feedback already told us E is in the word? And E(-) means not at position 5? We put E at positions 2 and 4? Which is fine? But BERET has double E? That could be possible.\n\nBut BERET contains E multiple times? And the secret word might have two E? Or one? We don\'t know? Our feedback from RAISE had only one E reported? But that could be because there is one E? Or if there are two Es, and one was in a wrong position? In RAISE, E was at position 5? But we got E(-) meaning E is present? But if the secret word had E elsewhere? But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about multiple letters? Wait, normally in Wordle, if a letter appears twice, and you guess it once and it\'s correct? Actually, let me recall the rules? Our rules are: \n- ✓: correct letter and position\n- -: letter in the word but wrong position\n- x: letter not in word\n\nAlso, if you guess a letter not repeated, and it appears once in the secret? But if you guess a letter that appears twice? You get feedback accordingly? But in this case, RAISE has only one E? And we got E(-)? So the secret word has E? But if it has two Es? We don\'t know? Because we only guessed one? Similarly, if the secret word has only one E, that\'s fine.\n\nSo multiple occurrences are possible? But we don\'t know? We can\'t assume? So BERET might be a valid word? But it contains E twice? But that\'s okay? It\'s a word! Also, we avoid A,I,S? BERET excludes those? Yes.\n\nHowever, BERET: \n- We put E at position 2? Could E be at position 2? We don\'t know? And E at position 4? Similarly, R at position 3? We don\'t know.\n\nBut also note: in BERET, position 3: R? Could be? Because R is not at position 1? Position 3 is allowed? \n\nBut let me compare OLDER and BERET? We want to maximize information? OLDER: O,L,D,E,R -> five new letters? Actually E and R are repeats? But we also introduce O,L,D? That\'s three new consonants? \n\nSimilarly, BERET has B, E, R, E, T? So letters: B,E,R,T? With E repeated? So effectively testing B, E, R, T? and E? So not as efficient? Because we use a letter slot for E again? \n\nAlternatively, how about ""ENTER""? But that has E at position 1 and 4? And N,T? And R at 5? But E at position 1? That could be? Because we don\'t have information against E at position 1? Our feedback was only that E is not at position 5? Position 1 is open? But ENTER ends with R? position 5? But let\'s see: E at 1: not tested before? However, we also have R at 5? \n\nBut ENTER? The word? Yes? \n\nBut perhaps better is to avoid putting E at position 1 until we know? Because we have E? Already? And R? \n\nI think OLDER is a good candidate? Because:\n- It doesn\'t start with R? Correct? OLDER starts with O?\n- It has E at position 4? Not 5? \n- It has R at position 5? Which we haven\'t tried? \n- We introduce O, L, D? Which are common? \n\nSo OLDER: O (position 1? new), L (2? new), D (3? new), E (4? we know E is present now at 4? must not be 5?), R (5? known letter? but new position?).\n\nBut we have confirmed E is in the word? So putting E at position 4? If it is correct? We get ✓? Or if it should be elsewhere? We get -? \n\nSimilarly? R at 5? could be correct? \n\nNow? another word? ""CORED"": C,O,R,E,D? But that has R at position 3? and E at position 4? And ends with D? So E not at 5? acceptable? \n\nBut let me see? which one gives better coverage: OLDER or similar? \n\nI also think about words that have R not at position 1? E not at position 5? and include common letters? \n\nFor example? ""PROTE"": not a word? How about ""TRIED"": but T? R? I? no? we cannot use I because we ruled out I? TRIED has I? invalid? \n\nAnother: ""CRONE"": C,R,O,N,E? but E at position 5? which is forbidden? Cannot guess? so if we guess CRONE? with E at 5? the feedback would immediately flag as wrong because E cannot be there? \n\nSimilarly? words ending with E are bad? \n\nSo? let\'s choose OLDER? \n\nWhat about ""RODEO"": but that has A? O? and sometimes Y? not? RODEO: R,O,D,E,O -> has O twice? and E at position 4? but we have R at position 1? we cannot put R at position 1? because our feedback said R not at 1? \n\nSo R must be placed differently? \n\nTherefore? OLDER? Let\'s write it:\n\nOLDER: \nPosition 1: O? new \nPosition 2: L? new \nPosition 3: D? new \nPosition 4: E? known? \nPosition 5: R? known? \n\nBut note: what if the secret word has R at position 5? But that might be? \n\nAlternatively? a word with R at position 2? E elsewhere? \n\nFor example? ""TREAD"": but A is invalid? \n\n""URBED"": not common? \n\n""CREPT"": C,R,E,P,T? E at position 3? and ends with T? so E not at 5? acceptable? but R is at position 2? Position indices: 1:C,2:R,3:E,4:P,5:T? \nCan we put R at position 2? Yes? because we only ruled out position 1? \n\nBut CREPT? is that a word? Crept is the past tense of creep? yes? \n\nSimilarly? CREPT: letters are C,R,E,P,T? all valid? no S,A,I? \n\nAnd we introduce C,R,E,P,T? but R and E are already known? So new letters: C,P,T? \nCompared to OLDER? OLDER introduces O,L,D? \n\nBoth introduce three new letters? \n\nBut CREPT has E at position 3? which may be less common? or more? \n\nI think OLDER is fine? but CREPT also? \n\nAnother option: ""OPTER"": not common? \n\n""BLUER"": but has U? and ends with R? but B,L,U,E,R? U test? \n\nBut perhaps we should avoid vowels? we already know about E? and A,I are out? so O and U are possible? \n\nI think both OLDER and CREPT are acceptable? \n\nI\'ll go with CREPT? wait? let\'s compare:\n\nOLDER: if we guess OLDER and secret word has E elsewhere? then E at 4 would show -? and R at 5? similarly? \n\nBut we want to test new letters? \n\nAnother word? ""THREW"": T,H,R,E,W? has E at position 4? and R at position 3? \n\nTHREW? T(1),H(2),R(3),E(4),W(5)? So E not at 5? okay? and R not at 1? okay? \n\nAnd letters: T,H,R,E,W? introduce T? H? W? plus R and E? \n\nThat\'s three new letters? \n\nSimilarly? \n\nBut perhaps THREW is common? \n\nAfter consideration? I choose CREPT? because C,P,T? are common? and CREPT is a word? \n\nBut CREPT: \nC(1)? new \nR(2)? known? but at new position? \nE(3)? known? at new position? \nP(4)? new \nT(5)? new \n\nThis also? not at forbidden positions? \n\nNow? since E in RAISE was at position 5? and we said E is present? so it\'s likely in another position? we have many possibilities? \n\nI will go with CREPT. I think it covers with R at position 2? E at position 3? which weren\'t tested? \n\nSo let\'s decide: CREPT? \n\nBut RE is consecutive? might be less likely? but we don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively? another word? like ""CORBY"": not common? \n\n""GONER"": has E? ends with R? E is at position 4? O,K? but G O N E R? \nPosition: 1:G?2:O?3:N?4:E?5:R -> E not at 5? acceptable? \nAnd letters: G?O?N?E?R? introduce G?O?N? \nBut we have E at same position? \n\nThe point is: both are valid? \n\nBut after more thought: it might be better to cover more common? \nSo OLDER? CREPT? THREW? BERET? \n\nI think CREPT or THREW? \n\nLet me pick THREW? \n\nWait? no? because I don\'t know? \n\nAlternatively? let\'s choose a word containing R and E and other letters? I\'ll go with ""THREW""?\n\nBut THREW: T H R E W? \nT at 1? H at 2? R at 3? E at 4? W at 5? \nWe introduce T,H,W? and R and E? \nE not at 5? good.\n\nSimilarly? we can consider ""DETER"": but has E twice? D? E? T? E? R? \nLetters: D?E?T?E?R? so D,T,R,E? \nBut we already know E? and DETER? E at position 2 and 4? \nBut it\'s a word? \n\nPerhaps THREW is better? \n\nI think THREW is a good choice? \n\nBut what about vowel? we tested many? only E? and secret might have O? or U? \n\nIn RAISE? we had vowels A? I? E? but only E is present? so the word contains E? and possibly no other vowels? or with consonants? \n\nFor example? ""THREW"" has E? so it tests E? \n\nSo? I\'ll use THREW? \n\nBut note: THREW has no O? which is a vowel? we don\'t know if O is present? \n\nBut we want to test common consonants? \n\nAnother word? ""PROBE"": has O? not A? I? S? P R O B E? \nLetters: P?R?O?B?E? \nAnd E at position 5? But we cannot put E at position 5 because feedback already showed E is not at position 5? \nThus? ""PROBE"" would have E at position 5? which is not allowed? so it\'s a bad guess? \n\nTherefore? avoid ending in E? \n\nSo ""CRONE"" is bad? etc? \n\nSo THREW? we can do? \n\nTHREW:\nGuessing THREW? \n\n<guess>THREW</guess> \n\nBut let me finalize? \n\nI think it\'s fine? \n\nLet me go with ""THREW"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""RAISE"":\n- R and E are present in the secret word but not in positions 1 and 5 respectively.\n- A, I, and S are absent from the word.\n\nThe new guess must:\n- Exclude A, I, and S.\n- Include R (any position except 1) and E (any position except 5).\n- Test new common consonants to gather more information.\n\nReasoning step by step:\n1. **Avoid forbidden positions**: Since R cannot be in position 1 and E cannot be in position 5, the guess must place R in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n2. **Introduce new letters**: Choose high-frequency consonants like T, H, W, N, L, or D to maximize information gain. Vowels are limited (only O, U, or Y are possible besides E, as A and I are ruled out).\n3. **Word selection**: ""THREW"" is suitable because:\n   - It includes E (position 4) and R (position 3), avoiding the forbidden positions.\n   - It introduces T, H, W—new letters for further testing.\n   - It contains no A, I, or S.\n   - It\'s a valid English word and helps position R and E in new slots.\n\nThis guess will help confirm positions for R and E while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>THREW</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n**Guess 1: RAISE**\n- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 1.\n- A(x): A is not in the word.\n- I(x): I is not in the word.\n- S(x): S is not in the word.\n- E(-): E is in the word but not in position 5.\n\n**Guess 2: THREW**\n- T(x): T is not in the word.\n- H(x): H is not in the word.\n- R(-): R is in the word but not in position 3 (since we guessed R in position 3).\n- E(✓): E is in the word and in the correct position.

We know position 4 is E, and R is present (somewhere else). So the other three letters are unknown but must not be the absent ones.\n   - We have tested: R,A,I,S,E,T,H,W. So missing letters include B,C,D,F,G,L,M,N,O,P,Q,U,V,Y, etc.\n\n5. **Requirements for new guess:**\n   - Must have E at position 4.\n   - Must not contain any of the absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W.\n   - Must include R if we haven\'t yet found its position? But we know R is present? Or is R already placed? No, we know R is present but not placed? Actually, from previous guesses, R must be in the word? And E is fixed at 4? Position 4 is occupied by E? So R must be in positions 2 or 5? We need to determine where R is? And also the remaining letters? And also we have no information about the other positions? \n\nBut note: the secret word has E at position 4? and R present? and the rest?

R somewhere? and the other letters? \n\nBut we know that R cannot be at position 1 or 3? so positions 2 or 5? \n\nSo? for the new guess? we must have E at position 4? and we can place R at either 2 or 5? to see? \n\nBut we also want to test new letters? \n\nLet me propose words? \n\nConstraints: \n- Position 4: E (fixed)\n- The word cannot have A, I, S, T, H, W.\n- Must include R (since it\'s present? unless? but feedback says R is present? so yes? if we omit R? it won\'t satisfy? So yes? must include R) in a position other than 1 and 3? but in the guess? we can put R at 2 or 5? \n\nSo possible words: \n\nList of 5-letter words with E at position 4? and that have R? and without A,I,S,T,H,W? \n\nStructure: \nPos1: ? \nPos2: ? or R? \nPos3: ? \nPos4: E \nPos5: ? or R? (if R is not at Pos2? then at Pos5? or if we put R at Pos2? we can test that)\n\nLet me think of words:\n\nOption 1: Put R at position 2? \nFormat: letter at1? R? letter at3? E? letter at5? \nFor example: C R ? E ? \n\nWords: \n- ""CRUEL"": but has U? E? L? \n  - But position5: L?\n  - But is L okay? We haven\'t tested L? and CRUEL: C,R,U,E,L -> \n  - Valid? E at4? \n  - But U and L are new? \n  - However, does it contain absent letters? A,I,S,T,H,W? no? T,H,W are absent? T is in absent? but CRUEL has no T,H,W? So okay? \n\nBut wait? CRUEL? position3 is U? position5 is L? \n\nBut we also need to verify if it contains R? at position2? yes? \n\nNow? what if R is not at position2? What if R is at position5? Then CRUEL would put R at2? which might be wrong? \n\nWe could instead put R at position5? to test? \n\nAnother word: with R at position5? Format: ? ? ? E R? \nFor example: ""FLEER"": but has F? L? E? E? R? \nBut FL E E R? positions: \n1:F? 2:L? 3:E? 4:E? but position4 must be E? but in FLEER? position4 would be E? and position5:R? \nBut note: FLEER? isn\'t a common word? \nAlso? we tested E? and we have E at position3? which we don\'t know? \n\nActually? FLEER? is a word? but let\'s look for common words? \n\nBetter: ""QUEER"": Q?U?E?E?R? but Q and U at positions 1 and 2? and E at position3? which we don\'t care? E at position4? and R at5? \n\nAlso? QUEER has E twice? \nBut? we don\'t know about duplicate? \n\nSimilarly? ""PLIER"": but has I? ruled out? \n\n""AUDIO"": ruled out? \n\nSo? words with R at5: \nExamples: ""POWER"": but has W? W is absent? \n""BEVER"": not a word? \n""DEMUR"": D?E?M?U?R -> positions: D at1? E at2? but position4 must be E? so not? \n\nFormat for R at5: we need position4 to be E? and position5 to be R? So words ending with ""ER"": \nPattern: ? ? ? E R? \n\nCommon words: \n- ""CIDER"": C,I,D? I is absent? invalid? \n- ""DINER"": has I? invalid? \n- ""FIGHTER"": too long? \n- ""LIKER"": has I? \n- ""MOWER"": has W? \n- ""NUDER"": not common? \n- ""RACER"": has A? invalid? \n- ""RAMEN"": not 5? \n- ""REPER"": not word? \n- ""RIPER"": has I? \n- ""ROGER"": O? G? E? R? but positions: R at1? O at2? G at3? E at4? R at5? \nBut in ROGER? position1: R? but we cannot put R at position1? because we know R is not at position1? from RAISE? \nSo ROGER is invalid? because it has R at1? \n\nSimilarly? words starting with R are invalid? \n\nSo words ending with ER? without absent letters? avoiding A,I,S,T,H,W? and not starting with R? \n\nFor example: ""BEEFY"": not ends with ER? \n""CYBER"": but positions: \nIf C Y B E R? positions: E at4? R at5? \nAnd C?Y?B? are new? \nAnd CYBER? word? \n\nCYBER: \n- C(1)? new\n- Y(2)? new? and vowel or consonant? \n- B(3)? new\n- E(4)? fixed\n- R(5)? which we want to test? possible R at position5? \n\nAlso? no absent letters? \n\nBut note? the secret word? must have E at position4? and R? which CYBER places R at5? \n\nAlternatively? ""GONER"": G? O? N? E? R? \nPositions: G(1)? O(2)? N(3)? E(4)? R(5)? \nSimilarly? not absent?\n\nAnd I? S? etc? no? \n\nSimilarly? ""HOMER"": H is absent? from THREW? H(x)? so cannot have H? \n\nTherefore? CYBER? GONER? etc? \n\nBut why not? \n\nAlso? CYBER? GONER introduce new letters? \n\nLet\'s go back: I need to guess a word that:\n\n- Position 4: E\n- Must include R? at position 2 or 5? \n- And other letters not in absent set? \n\nBut also? we can put R at multiple positions? or just one? Since the secret has R exactly once? or possibly twice? but we don\'t know? Each guess is interpreted individually? \n\nIn CYBER? R is only at position5? \n\nSimilarly? for position2? Like CRUEL? \n\nNow? the choice: should I put R at position2 or position5? \n\nSince we know R cannot be at position1 or 3? it must be at position2 or position5? \n\nSo if I put R at position2 in this guess? and it\'s correct? we get ✓? If not? then R must be at position5? because those are the only options? \n\nSimilarly? if I put R at position5 and it\'s wrong? then we must put R at position2? \n\nSo we can decide? \n\nBut also? we can cover both? but with one guess? \n\nFor example? if we put R at position2? and also test new letters? \n\nOr? we can put R at position5? \n\nBut I want to maximize information about other letters? \n\nPerhaps? put R at position2? and include common new letters? \n\nSo guess: ? R ? E ? \n\nWhere positions 1,3,5 are new letters? \n\nSimilarly? avoid absent letters? \n\nOr if we put R at position5? pattern: ? ? ? E R? \n\nBut then positions 1,2,3 need to be filled? \n\nBut note? in the second pattern? position3 is tested? \n\nFrom THREW? position3: R? got (-)? meaning the correct R is not at position3? but that doesn\'t tell us what letter is actually at position3? \n\nSo we need to guess letters for positions 1,2,3? \n\nThe same for positions 1,2,5? \n\nBut we have E fixed at4? so position3 must be a letter? \n\nBoth scenarios are symmetric? \n\nSo let me choose to put R at position2? Then we can test:\n\nFor positions 1,3,5 with new letters? and R at2? E at4? \n\nExamples: \n- ""CRUEL"": C at1? R at2? U at3? E at4? L at5? \n  Letters: C,R,U,E,L? All new except R and E? \n  Absent letters? None? So okay? \n\nAnother: ""DRIED"": D? R? I? E? D? But contains I? absent? invalid? \n\n""FREED"": F? R? E? E? D? But E twice? and E at position3? but position3? and position4:E? \nBut note? position3 and position4 are different? \nFREED: \n1: F? \n2: R? \n3: E? But wait? we put E at position3? Now? from feedback? we know E is at position4? but we don\'t know about E elsewhere? \nIf the secret word has only one E? then putting E at position3 would be useless? if it\'s not present? \nBut FREED has E at position3? That\'s okay? \nBut also? D at position5? \nBut note? the secret word has E at position4? and we don\'t know if there are other E? \nSo it could be? \nAlso? FREED? does it contain S?A?I? no? But T?H?W? no? so okay? \nBut E at position3: if there is no E at position3? it would show x? because E is present? so we would know? \n\nBut let\'s focus? \nI think CRUEL is a valid word? and introduces C?U?L? \n\nSimilarly? ""GRUEL"": G?R?U?E?L? same as CRUEL? \nAlso valid? \n\nBut either? \n\nI can also use ""PROWL"": but no? position4 must be E? \n\nNot: ""BRULE"": perhaps not common? \n\nSo perhaps CRUEL or GRUEL? \n\nBut GRUEL is more common? meaning? \n\nAlternatively? ""QUEEN"": Q?U?E?E?N? but E at position4? but position3 also E? \nAnd no R? we must include R? because R is present? we cannot omit R? \nSo QUEEN does not contain R? invalid? \n\nAnother word: ""CREWL"": not a word? \n\nSo? CRUEL? \n\nBut CRUEL? L at position5? \n\nNow? similarly? we can put R at position5? with GONER? etc? \n\nBut let\'s choose putting R at position2? because position5 we haven\'t tested? and position2 we might need to confirm? \n\nAnother word: ""DETER"": D?E?T?E?R? but T is absent? so cannot? because THREW said T(x). \n\n""PETER"": P?E?T?E?R? T absent? \n\n""BEVER"": not word? \n\nSo back to? \n\nI think ""CRUEL"" or ""GRUEL"" or ""PRUDE"": PRUDE? P?R?U?D?E? positions: \n1:P? \n2:R? \n3:U? \n4:E? \n5:D -> D? \nBut E at position4? \nAnd no absent letters? \nPRUDE is a valid word? \n\nSo ""PRUDE"": P at1? R at2? U at3? D at5? \n\nAlso? introduces P?R?U?D?E? but R and E known? \n\nSimilarly? letters P,U,D? new? \n\nPRUDE vs CRUEL? \n\nPRUDE doesn\'t have C or L? \n\nBut equally good? \n\nI\'ll choose ""PRUDE"" as the guess? \n\nBut wait? both are okay? \n\nAlternatively? think about the most common letters: \nThe remaining common consonants: B?C?D?F?G?L?M?N?O?P?Q?U?V?Y? \n\nSo CRUEL: C,U?L? \nPRUDE: P?U?D? \n\nPerhaps similar? \n\nBut let me try PRUDE? \n\nWhy not? \n\nSo? new guess: PRUDE? with E at4? R at2? \n\nIn the feedback? for R? since we put R at position2? we will get: \n- If R is correct at2? then ✓ for R? \n- If R is in the word but not at2? then it must be at position5? therefore we get - for R? meaning R is misplaced? \n\nSimilarly? for E? we already know E at4 is correct? so it will be ✓? \n\nAnd we\'ll learn about P? U? D? \n\nSimilarly with other words? \n\nBut also? note? if PRUDE? position3: U? which might be? \n\nSo? let me use PRUDE? \n\nBut one more thought: the secret word might have U? but we don\'t know? \n\nAlso? GONER? for putting R at5? \n\nBut let\'s not overcomplicate? I think PRUDE is fine? \n\nSo? guess: ""PRUDE""Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**: R is present but not pos 1, A/I/S absent, E present but not pos 5.\n- **Guess 2 (THREW)**: T/H/W absent, R present but not pos 3, E is in the word and CORRECT at pos 4.\n\n**Deductions:**\n- E is fixed at position 4 in the secret word.\n- R must be present but cannot be in positions 1 or 3, leaving only positions 2 or 5 possible.\n- Absent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W.\n- The new guess must:\n  - Have E in position 4.\n  - Include R (in position 2 or 5 to test its location).\n  - Exclude absent letters (A/I/S/T/H/W).\n  - Test new common consonants for positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\n**Word Choice Reasoning:**  \n""PRUDE"" is selected because:\n- Position 4: E (correct placement).\n- Position 2: R (tests if R belongs here; feedback will indicate if correct or if R is in position 5).\n- Positions 1, 3, 5: P, U, D (new high-frequency letters to probe).\n- No absent letters and valid English word.\n\nThis guess efficiently narrows R\'s position (2 or 5) while testing three new letters.\n\n<guess>PRUDE</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)\nGuess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the following feedback history:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\n- R: present but not in position 1 (so R is in the word, but not at index 1)\n- A: absent\n- I: absent\n- S: absent\n- E: present but not in position 5 (so E is in the word, but not at index 5)\n\nGuess 2: THREW\n- T: absent\n- H: absent\n- R: present but not in position 3 (so R is in the word, but not at index 3)\n- E: correct at position 4 (so the secret word has E at position 4)\n- W: absent\n\nGuess 3: PRUDE\n- P: absent\n- R: present but not in position 2 (so R is in the word, but not at index 2)\n- U: absent\n- D: absent\n- E: present but not in position 4? Wait, this is confusing because in PRUDE, E is at position 4, but the feedback says E(-) meaning it is present but not in the correct position? But we already know from guess 2 that E is correct at position 4.\n\nThis is a contradiction. Let me reexamine:\n\nIn guess 2 (THREW), we had E at position 4 marked as correct (✓). That means the secret word has E at position 4.\n\nIn guess 3 (PRUDE), we also put E at position 4. Since the secret word has E at position 4, the feedback for E in PRUDE should be ✓, not (-). But the feedback says E(-), which would mean that E is in the word but not at position 4. This contradicts the previous feedback.\n\nThere must be a misunderstanding. Let me clarify the feedback format.\n\nThe feedback for PRUDE: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)\n\nBut E is at position 4 in PRUDE. If the secret word has E at position 4, then E should be marked as correct (✓), not (-). The (-) for E in PRUDE would imply that E is not at position 4 in the secret word? But that can\'t be because we already have E(✓) at position 4 from THREW.\n\nThis suggests an error in the feedback or in our understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is incorrect? Or maybe the secret word has only one E? But in THREW, E was at position 4 and correct, so it must be there.\n\nAnother possibility: the feedback for PRUDE\'s E is a mistake? But let\'s assume the feedback is correct.\n\nWait, the feedback for PRUDE: E(-) means that E is in the word but not at position 4? But that contradicts the fact that we have E at position 4 from THREW.\n\nUnless... the secret word has multiple E\'s? For example, if the secret word has E at position 4 and another E elsewhere, then in PRUDE, we have E at position 4 which is correct, so it should be ✓, and if there is another E, then the E in PRUDE at position 4 would still be ✓ because it\'s the correct letter in the correct position.\n\nThe feedback symbol ✓ means correct letter and correct position, regardless of duplicates.\n\nSo if the secret word has E at position 4, then any guess that has E at position 4 must get a ✓ for that position.\n\nTherefore, the feedback for E in PRUDE should be ✓, not (-). But it\'s given as (-), which is inconsistent.\n\nThis implies that the secret word does not have E at position 4? But that contradicts guess 2\'s feedback.\n\nPerhaps I misremembered the position? Let\'s list the positions:\n\nTHREW: positions\n1: T\n2: H\n3: R\n4: E (marked ✓)\n5: W\n\nSo E is at position 4 and correct.\n\nPRUDE: positions\n1: P\n2: R\n3: U\n4: E\n5: D\n\nFeedback for PRUDE: P(x), R(-), U(x), D(x), E(-)\n\nE at position 4 is marked as (-), meaning present but not at position 4? But that can\'t be if position 4 is E in the secret word.\n\nUnless the feedback for E in PRUDE is for the letter E, but since it\'s at position 4 and the secret has E at position 4, it should be ✓.\n\nThis is a problem. Perhaps there is a misunderstanding of the feedback format.\n\nLet me re-read the initial rules:\n\n""After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.\n\nFeedback Format:\nEach letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:\n1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.\n2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.\n3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.""\n\nIn the case of PRUDE, if the secret word has E at position 4, then the E in position 4 of the guess must be ✓. But the feedback says E(-), which is wrong position. This is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the secret word does not have E at position 4? But guess 2 said E(✓) at position 4.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the feedback for guess 2 was for THREW, and the secret word changed? But no, it\'s the same secret word.\n\nPerhaps I have a bug in the interpretation.\n\nLet\'s look at the feedback string for guess 3: ""P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)""\n\nFor E, it\'s (-), which means the letter E is in the word but not at position 4. But from guess 2, we know E is at position 4. Contradiction.\n\nUnless in guess 2, the E was not at position 4? But the feedback said E(✓) for position 4.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the feedback provided, or in my reasoning.\n\nPerhaps the position indexing is off? But I think it\'s standard.\n\nAnother possibility: in guess 2, THREW, the E was at position 4 and marked ✓, so that\'s fixed.\n\nIn guess 3, PRUDE, we have E at position 4, so it should be ✓. But the feedback says E(-), which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, I must conclude that the feedback for E in PRUDE is incorrect as reported, or there is a misunderstanding.\n\nBut let\'s assume the feedback is correct and reexamine guess 2.\n\nGuess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)\n\nThe feedback is given as ""E(✓)"", which should mean that the letter in the position of E in THREW (which is position 4) is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for PRUDE, ""E(-)"" means that the letter E in position 4 of PRUDE is not correct, but present elsewhere.\n\nThis is a direct contradiction.\n\nUnless the secret word has two E\'s? Let\'s consider that.\n\nSuppose the secret word has two E\'s. In THREW, we have E at position 4, which is one of the E\'s, so it gets ✓. In PRUDE, we have E at position 4, but if the secret word has E at position 4, it should be ✓. If the secret word has E at position 4, then PRUDE\'s E at 4 must be ✓.\n\nThe only way for PRUDE\'s E to be (-) is if the secret word has an E, but not at position 4. But that contradicts the ✓ from THREW.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that the feedback for guess 3 is misreported or there is an error.\n\nPerhaps the feedback for guess 2 was not E(✓) but something else? But it\'s given as E(✓).\n\nLet\'s read the user\'s message: ""Guess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)""\n\nYes, E(✓).\n\nFor guess 3: ""Guess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)""\n\nE(-).\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the positions are 1-based, but maybe the feedback is per letter without position? But the feedback is for each letter in order.\n\nI think I have to accept the feedback as given and assume that the secret word does not have E at position 4, which means the feedback for guess 2 was misinterpreted.\n\nBut that doesn\'t make sense.\n\nAnother idea: in guess 2, the feedback ""E(✓)"" might mean that E is in the word and in some position, but not necessarily position 4? No, the feedback is for the specific position.\n\nThe feedback is given for each letter in the order of the guess, so for THREW, the fourth letter E is correct.\n\nSimilarly for PRUDE, the fourth letter E is not correct, but E is in the word elsewhere.\n\nThis is impossible.\n\nUnless the secret word changed, but it\'s the same game.\n\nI think there might be a typo in the feedback for guess 3. Perhaps it\'s not E(-) but E(✓)? Or something else.\n\nBut I have to work with what\'s given.\n\nPerhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is for the letter, but since it\'s the same as position 4, it should be ✓.\n\nI\'m stuck.\n\nLet\'s ignore the contradiction for a moment and list what we know.\n\nFrom guess 1:\n- R is in the word, not at position 1.\n- A, I, S are absent.\n- E is in the word, not at position 5.\n\nFrom guess 2:\n- T, H, W are absent.\n- R is in the word, not at position 3.\n- E is in the word and at position 4? But then from guess 3, E at position 4 is not correct, so let\'s not assume.\n\nFrom guess 2 feedback E(✓), we must have E at position 4.\n\nFrom guess 3 feedback E(-), we have that E is in the word but not at position 4.\n\nContradiction.\n\nPerhaps the feedback for guess 3 is ""E(✓)"" but written as ""E(-)"" by mistake? That might be the case.\n\nOr perhaps in the context, the E in PRUDE is at position 4, and if it\'s (-), it means that the secret word has E, but not at position 4, which contradicts.\n\nI think I have to assume that the feedback for guess 3 is incorrect or that there\'s a misunderstanding of the position.\n\nAnother possibility: the feedback for PRUDE is for the letters, not positions? But the format is per position.\n\nLet\'s read the initial example: ""Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)"" so it\'s for each letter in order.\n\nSimilarly, for PRUDE, ""P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)"" means:\n- P at position 1: absent\n- R at position 2: present but wrong position\n- U at position 3: absent\n- D at position 4: absent? Wait, no, D is at position 5? Let\'s see:\n\nPRUDE: \nPosition 1: P\nPosition 2: R\nPosition 3: U\nPosition 4: E\nPosition 5: D\n\nFeedback: P(x) for position 1, R(-) for position 2, U(x) for position 3, D(x) for position 5? But the feedback says ""D(x) E(-)"", so D(x) is for position 5, and E(-) for position 4.\n\nE at position 4 is marked as (-), meaning present but not at position 4.\n\nBut from guess 2, position 4 is E and correct.\n\nThis is the contradiction.\n\nUnless in guess 2, the E was not at position 4? But it was.\n\nI think I have to proceed by ignoring the E feedback from guess 3 or something.\n\nPerhaps the secret word has only one E, and in guess 2, E at position 4 was correct, so in guess 3, E at position 4 should be correct, so the feedback must be E(✓), but it\'s given as E(-), so maybe it\'s a typo and it\'s E(✓).\n\nOtherwise, the game is inconsistent.\n\nFor the sake of progressing, I will assume that the feedback for E in PRUDE is a mistake and it should be E(✓), because of the previous feedback.\n\nPerhaps the user meant E(✓) but typed E(-) by error.\n\nBecause otherwise, it\'s impossible.\n\nSo I\'ll assume that for PRUDE, E should be E(✓), and the feedback is misstated.\n\nSo corrected feedback for PRUDE: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(✓)\n\nThen it makes sense.\n\nBecause E at position 4 is correct.\n\nThen R at position 2 is present but not at 2, so R is not at position 2.\n\nP, U, D are absent.\n\nSo let\'s assume that.\n\nOtherwise, we can\'t proceed.\n\nSo from now on, I\'ll assume the feedback for E in PRUDE is ✓.\n\nSo:\n\nGuess 3: PRUDE feedback: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(✓)\n\nThen:\n\n- P: absent\n- R: present but not at position 2 (so R not at 2)\n- U: absent\n- D: absent\n- E: correct at position 4\n\nNow, from previous:\n\n- R is present, not at position 1 (from RAISE), not at position 3 (from THREW), not at position 2 (from PRUDE), so R must be at position 5.\n\nPositions are 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nR cannot be at 1,2,3, so only position 5 left.\n\nAlso, E is at position 4.\n\nAbsent letters: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D.\n\nPresent letters: R, E, and three others.\n\nR must be at position 5.\n\nSo secret word: _ _ _ E R\n\nPositions: 1,2,3 are unknown, 4:E, 5:R.\n\nLetters to fill: three letters, not in absent set.\n\nAbsent: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D\n\nSo available letters: B,C,F,G,L,M,N,O,Q,V,Y,Z, etc. But common letters.\n\nWe need to guess a word of the form _ _ _ E R, with the first three letters not absent.\n\nNew guess must have E at 4, R at 5, and positions 1,2,3 with new letters.\n\nFor example, ""BOXER"", but X might not be common.\n\n""BOXER"": B,O,X,E,R\n\nCheck absent: B not absent, O not absent, X not tested, E and R known.\n\nBut X is less common.\n\n""JOKER"": J,O,K,E,R\n\nJ and K not tested.\n\nBut let\'s think of common letters.\n\nSince we have few guesses left, we can try to cover common letters.\n\nAvailable common consonants: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, Y\n\nVowels: O, and sometimes Y.\n\nBut we have position 1,2,3 to fill.\n\nFor example, ""LONER"": L,O,N,E,R\n\nBut N is common.\n\nLONER: positions 1:L, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R\n\nCheck absent: L not absent, O not absent, N not absent.\n\nSimilarly, ""GONER"": G,O,N,E,R\n\nG not absent.\n\nBut G was not tested.\n\nAnother: ""MINER"": but M not absent, but I is absent, so invalid.\n\nI is absent, so no.\n\n""COVER"": C,O,V,E,R\n\nC, O, V not absent.\n\nV is less common.\n\n""BOXER"" is a word.\n\nBut let\'s list possible words: _ _ _ E R\n\nWith the first three letters from: B,C,F,G,L,M,N,O,Q,V,Y\n\nCommon words: \n- LOVER: L,O,V,E,R -> V is not common, but valid.\n- MOWER: but W is absent.\n- POWER: W absent.\n- HOMER: H absent.\n- So not.\n\n""BAKER"": B,A,K,E,R but A absent.\n\nA is absent.\n\n""MAKER"": A absent.\n\n""RACER"": A absent.\n\nSo no A.\n\n""FEWER"": F,E,W,E,R but W absent and E repeated.\n\nW absent.\n\n""JEWEL"": not E R ending.\n\nSo perhaps ""BOXER"", ""JOKER"", ""CODER"" but D absent.\n\nD is absent from PRUDE feedback.\n\nD(x) so absent.\n\nSo no D.\n\n""COVER"" is good.\n\nOr ""LOVER"".\n\nBut let\'s choose ""COVER"": C,O,V,E,R\n\nIntroduces C,O,V.\n\nBut V is not very common, but it\'s a word.\n\n""COMER"": C,O,M,E,R\n\nM not absent.\n\n""COMER"" is a word.\n\nSimilarly, ""CORER"": but O at position 2, R at position 3? But R is at position 5, and we have only one R? But ""CORER"" has two R\'s? C,O,R,E,R -> positions: 1:C,2:O,3:R,4:E,5:R\n\nBut we have R at position 3 and 5. But from feedback, R is present, but we don\'t know about duplicates.\n\nIn this case, if we guess ""CORER"", and secret has only one R, then the R at position 3 might be marked differently.\n\nBut it\'s messy.\n\nBetter to avoid duplicates for now.\n\nSo ""COMER"": C,O,M,E,R\n\nPositions: 1:C,2:O,3:M,4:E,5:R\n\nAll new letters except E and R.\n\nAnd C,O,M not absent.\n\nSimilarly, ""COVER"" has V.\n\nI think ""COMER"" is better.\n\nBut ""COMER"" is a word? It means one who comes, like in ""newcomer"", but as a standalone, it might be accepted.\n\nAnother common word: ""BOXER"" or ""JOKER"".\n\n""JOKER"" is common.\n\nJ is not absent.\n\nSo let\'s go with ""JOKER"".\n\nGuess: JOKER\n\nBut J is not very common, but it\'s a valid guess.\n\nTo maximize information, we can choose a word with common letters.\n\nAvailable common letters: B, C, F, G, L, M, N, O, Y\n\nFor example, ""LONER"": L,O,N,E,R\n\nL, O, N are common.\n\nSimilarly, ""GONER"": G,O,N,E,R\n\nG and N common.\n\nOr ""BONER"": B,O,N,E,R - also a word.\n\nBut let\'s choose ""LONER"".\n\nSo new guess: LONER\n\nPositions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:N, 4:E, 5:R\n\nWe will get feedback on L, O, N.\n\nIf any are correct or present.\n\nBut since we have to guess, and we know E and R are fixed.\n\nSo <guess>LONER</guess>\n\nBut we have the contradiction issue.\n\nPerhaps the feedback for E in PRUDE is correct, and we have to rethink.\n\nBut I think for the sake of continuing, I\'ll go with LONER.\n\nSo in the response, I\'ll assume the feedback for E in PRUDE is E(✓) implicitly.\n\nSo summary for new guess:\n\nSecret word has E at 4, R at 5, and positions 1,2,3 to be guessed.\n\nAbsent letters: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D\n\nSo guess ""LONER"" to test L, O, N.\n\n<guess>LONER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Review Previous Feedback**:\n   - **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:\n     - R: Present but not in position 1.\n     - A, I, S: Absent.\n     - E: Present but not in position 5.\n   - **Guess 2 (THREW)**:\n     - T, H, W: Absent.\n     - R: Present but not in position 3.\n     - E: Correct at position 4 (secret word has E in position 4).\n   - **Guess 3 (PRUDE)**:\n     - P, U, D: Absent.\n     - R: Present but not in position 2.\n     - E: Feedback is ""E(-)"", but this conflicts with Guess 2\'s ""E(✓)"" at position 4. After re-evaluating, the feedback for E in PRUDE must be inconsistent due to a possible error, as E cannot be both correct at position 4 (from THREW) and misplaced in the same position (PRUDE). For consistency, I\'ll treat E as correct at position 4, as established by Guess 2.\n\n2. **Key Deductions**:\n   - **E is fixed at position 4**: Confirmed by Guess 2\'s feedback.\n   - **R must be at position 5**: \n     - R is present but cannot be in position 1 (from RAISE), position 3 (from THREW), or position 2 (from PRUDE). The only remaining position is 5.\n   - **Absent letters**: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D (from all feedback).\n   - **Secret word structure**: The secret word is `_ _ _ E R`, with positions 1, 2, and 3 unknown.\n   - **Available letters**: Must be from the remaining letters not absent (B, C, F, G, L, M, N, O, Q, V, Y, etc.). Common consonants like B, C, F, G, L, M, N and vowels like O, Y are prioritized for information gain.\n\n3. **Strategy for New Guess**:\n   - The new guess must have E at position 4 and R at position 5 to confirm R\'s placement.\n   - Positions 1, 2, and 3 should test new high-frequency letters to maximize information (e.g., L, O, N, M, C).\n   - Avoid absent letters and reuse of known letters (only E and R are confirmed present).\n   - ""LONER"" is chosen because:\n     - Structure: `L O N E R` (E at 4, R at 5).\n     - Tests L (position 1), O (position 2), and N (position 3)—all common letters not yet tested.\n     - Valid English word, fitting the pattern `_ _ _ E R`.\n\n4. **Expected Outcomes**:\n   - If L, O, or N are correct, we narrow down the secret word quickly.\n   - If all are absent, we eliminate three common letters and focus on other options (e.g., C, M, G).\n\n<guess>LONER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)\nGuess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)\nGuess 4: LONER -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from four guesses:\n\n**Guess 1: RAISE**\n- R: present, wrong position (not position 1)\n- A: absent\n- I: absent\n- S: absent\n- E: present, wrong position (not position 5)\n\n**Guess 2: THREW**\n- T: absent\n- H: absent\n- R: present, wrong position (not position 3)\n- E: correct at position 4\n- W: absent\n\n**Guess 3: PRUDE**\n- P: absent\n- R: present, wrong position (not position 2)\n- U: absent\n- D: absent\n- E: present, wrong position (note: from Guess 2, E is known to be at position 4, but feedback here shows E(-), which might be a mistake. However, we proceed with the data given.)\n\n**Guess 4: LONER**\n- L: absent\n- O: correct at position 2\n- N: absent\n- E: correct at position 4\n- R: correct at position 5\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Fixed Positions**:\n   - Position 2: O (from LONER, O(✓))\n   - Position 4: E (from THREW and LONER)\n   - Position 5: R (from LONER, R(✓))\n\n2. **R\'s Position is Now Known**: \n   - From LONER, R is correct at position 5. This aligns with previous deductions that R cannot be at position 1, 2, or 3. Position 5 is confirmed.\n   - Also, since R is now at position 5, previous ""R(-)"" feedback makes sense as it was not in the correct position in earlier guesses.\n\n3. **E\'s Position**:\n   - Position 4 is confirmed correct for E (from Guess 2 and Guess 4).\n   - In Guess 3 (PRUDE), E was guessed at position 4 but given feedback E(-), which contradicts E being always at position 4. For consistency, we must accept that the secret word has E at position 4, so there might have been an error in the feedback for Guess 3. We\'ll proceed with E at position 4 being fixed.\n\n4. **O\'s Position**:\n   - Position 2 is O (from Guess 4).\n\n5. **Absent Letters**:\n   - From all guesses: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D, L, N\n   - List: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D, L, N\n\n6. **Present Letters**:\n   - R, E, O (O is now fixed at position 2)\n   - Since the word has only one more letter (at position 1 and 3), but we have position 3 unknown and position 1 unknown.\n   - We also have E and R fixed, and O fixed at position 2.\n\n### Secret Word Structure:\n- Position 1: Unknown letter (not absent)\n- Position 2: O (fixed)\n- Position 3: Unknown letter (not absent)\n- Position 4: E (fixed)\n- Position 5: R (fixed)\n\nSo the word is `_ O _ E R`.\n\n- We need to find two letters: one for position 1 and one for position 3.\n- These letters must not be from the absent set: A,I,S,T,H,W,P,U,D,L,N.\n\n### Available Letters:\n- Possible letters: English letters except absent ones. Common consonants: B, C, F, G, M, Q, V, Y, etc.\n\n### Strategy for Next Guess:\n- We must guess a word that fits `_ O _ E R`, inserting letters not absent.\n- We have two unknown positions, so we can test common letters.\n- Since we have limited guesses (this is our fifth guess), we want to maximize information.\n\n### Choosing the Word:\n- Pattern: `X O Y E R` where X and Y are letters from available set.\n- We need to select meaningful words.\n- Examples: \n  - ""COVER"": C O V E R → position 1=C, position 3=V\n  - ""CODER"" (but D is absent, so invalid)\n  - ""COMER"": C O M E R → position 3=M\n  - ""BOXER"": B O X E R → position 1=B, position 3=X\n  - ""JOKER"": J O K E R → position 1=J, position 3=K\n  - However, note that X and K are less common.\n\n- To cover more common letters, we might choose ""COMER"" or ""COVER"".\n- But ""COVER"" has V which is less common. \n- Another option: ""BOYER"" (proper name) or ""BOGER"" (less common).\n- Better: ""GONER"" but we know O and N? N is absent? From Guess 4: N is absent, so invalid.\n\nWe have N absent from LONER, so position 3 cannot be N.\n\nPossible words:\n- ""COMER"" (if accepted)\n- ""COGER"" (not common)\n- ""COWER"": but W is absent.\n\nAlternatively, ""FOREX"" — not matching pattern.\n\n""Foyer"": not 5 letters? ""Foyer"" is 5 letters: F-O-Y-E-R.\nYes, ""FOYER"": F O Y E R → F at position 1, Y at position 3.\n\nSimilarly, ""COYER"": C O Y E R.\n\nBoth are words.\n\nWe can try ""FOYER"" to test F and Y.\n\nBut Y is a consonant/vowel and less common.\n\nAnother word: ""COVER"" is good, testing C and V.\n\nWith two unknowns, we can also choose a word with repeated letters, but unnecessary.\n\nGiven the fixes, and that we have only position 1 and 3 unknown, we can make a guess that uses common letters.\n\nSelect ""COVER"": \n- C and V are not tested yet.\n- If we get feedback, we will know if they are or aren\'t.\n\nBut a better word might be ""BOXER"" since B and X?\n\nAlternatively, ""JOKER"" uses J and K — not ideal.\n\nChoose ""COMER"" if we think M is likely? But M wasn\'t tested.\n\nSince we have two unknowns and only one guess (we can guess and then correct next), but with this pattern, there might be multiple options.\n\nLet\'s list possible common words matching `_ O _ E R`:\n- COVER (C and V)\n- COMER (C and M)\n- BOXER (B and X)\n- FOYER (F and Y)\n- CORKER — has K? and R at position 3? But we have R at position 5, and position 3: K? C O K E R? ""Coker"" — C O K E R? But K is in position 3.\n- Similarly, ""COPER"": C O P E R — but P is absent from Guess 3.\n\nP is absent, so can\'t be.\n\nAnother: ""GONER"" — N absent.\n\nSo available:\n- COVER: C, O, V, E, R\n- COMER: C, O, M, E, R\n- BOXER: B, O, X, E, R\n- FOYER: F, O, Y, E, R\n- etc.\n\nWe can choose ""COVER"" assuming it\'s a valid guess.\n\n### Feedback Prediction:\n- If we guess ""COVER"", and the secret is ""COVER"", we win.\n- If not, we get information on C and V.\n\nBut with the structure, the only other options might be limited.\n\n### Recommendation:\nGuess ""COVER"" to test C and V.\n\nIf not that, then next would be ""COMER"", but we have to pick one.\n\nTo maximize common letters, ""COMER"" uses M (more common than V or X), so I\'ll go with ""COMER"".\n\n<guess>COMER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:\nFrom the feedback:\n- **Guess 1 (RAISE)**:\n  - R is present but not at pos 1.\n  - A, I, S absent.\n  - E is present but not at pos 5.\n- **Guess 2 (THREW)**:\n  - T, H, W absent.\n  - R present but not at pos 3.\n  - E is **fixed at position 4** (✓).\n- **Guess 3 (PRUDE)**:\n  - P, U, D absent.\n  - R present but not at pos 2.\n  - E feedback ""-"" conflicts with Guess 2\'s ✓ at pos 4; this is resolved by prioritizing the E(✓) confirmation from Guess 2 and Guess 4.\n- **Guess 4 (LONER)**:\n  - L, N absent.\n  - O is **fixed at position 2** (✓).\n  - E is ***confirmed fixed at position 4*** (✓).\n  - R is **fixed at position 5** (✓).\n\n### Deductions:\n1. **Fixed positions**:\n   - Position 2: O (from Guess 4).\n   - Position 4: E (from Guess 2 and Guess 4).\n   - Position 5: R (from Guess 4).\n2. **Absent letters**: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D, L, N.\n3. **Secret word structure**: `_ O _ E R`:\n   - Position 1 and 3 must be filled with remaining non-absent letters (common: B, C, F, G, M, V, Y).\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - Position 1 and 3 are unknown. Use a word that tests common consonants at these positions.\n   - ""COMER"" is chosen:\n     - Tests C (position 1) and M (position 3).\n     - Valid 5-letter word matching `_ O _ E R`.\n     - C and M are high-frequency letters not tested before.\n\nIf ""COMER"" is incorrect, feedback will eliminate C/M and narrow options to words like ""COVER"", ""FOYER"", or ""BOXER"".\n\n<guess>COMER</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: THREW -> FEEDBACK: T(x) H(x) R(-) E(✓) W(x)\nGuess 3: PRUDE -> FEEDBACK: P(x) R(-) U(x) D(x) E(-)\nGuess 4: LONER -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) N(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 5: COMER -> FEEDBACK: C(x) O(✓) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from five guesses:

**Guess 1: RAISE**
- R: present, not position 1
- A: absent
- I: absent
- S: absent
- E: present, not position 5

**Guess 2: THREW**
- T: absent
- H: absent
- R: present, not position 3
- E: correct at position 4
- W: absent

**Guess 3: PRUDE**
- P: absent
- R: present, not position 2
- U: absent
- D: absent
- E: present, not position 4? But this conflicts with Guess 2. However, we proceed with the data.

**Guess 4: LONER**
- L: absent
- O: correct at position 2
- N: absent
- E: correct at position 4
- R: correct at position 5

**Guess 5: COMER**
- C: absent
- O: correct at position 2
- M: absent
- E: correct at position 4
- R: correct at position 5

### Deductions:
1. **Fixed Positions**:
   - Position 2: O (from Guess 4 and 5)
   - Position 4: E (from Guess 2, 4, 5)
   - Position 5: R (from Guess 4 and 5)

2. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all guesses: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D, L, N, C, M
   - Full list: A, C, D, H, I, L, M, N, P, S, T, U, W

3. **Present Letters**:
   - R, E, O are fixed and known.
   - The only other present letter must be for position 1 and 3, but we have no other known present letters. Since the word has 5 letters, and we have O, E, R fixed, the other two positions (1 and 3) must be filled with two new letters that are not absent.

4. **Secret Word Structure**:
   - The word is `X O Y E R`, where X is position 1 and Y is position 3.
   - X and Y must be letters not in the absent list and not O, E, R (since those are fixed and we don't have duplicates indicated).

5. **Available Letters**:
   - Remaining letters: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but common ones: B, F, G, V, Y)

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to guess a word of the form `X O Y E R` with X and Y from the available letters.
- Since we have only one guess left (6th guess), we must choose a word that could be the solution or narrow it down.
- Possible words: 
  - ""BOXER"": B O X E R → tests B and X
  - ""FOYER"": F O Y E R → tests F and Y
  - ""JOKER"": J O K E R → tests J and K
  - ""GONER"": but N is absent, invalid
  - ""COVER"": C is absent, invalid
  - ""HOMER"": H absent, invalid
  - ""POKER"": P absent, invalid

- Common options: ""BOXER"", ""FOYER"", ""JOKER"", ""VOTER"" (but T absent), etc.

- ""FOYER"" is a valid word (meaning an entrance hall) and uses F and Y, which are plausible.
- ""BOXER"" is also common (a type of dog or fighter).
- ""JOKER"" is common (playing card or person).

- Since we have no information, we can choose one arbitrarily. Let's pick ""FOYER"" to test F and Y.

### Final Guess:
- If ""FOYER"" is correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on F and Y, and can deduce the word in the next guess (but we have only one guess left? Actually, this is the 6th guess? We started with 1,2,3,4,5, so this is the 6th and final guess).

We have to make the best guess.

Alternatively, we can consider the frequency of letters. F is more common than J or X, so ""FOYER"" might be better.

But let's choose ""FOYER"".

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback and Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Positions** (from Guess 4 and 5):
     - Position 2: **O** (✓ in LONER and COMER).
     - Position 4: **E** (✓ in THREW, LONER, COMER).
     - Position 5: **R** (✓ in LONER and COMER).
   - **Absent Letters** (from all feedback):
     - A, I, S (Guess 1), T, H, W (Guess 2), P, U, D (Guess 3), L, N (Guess 4), C, M (Guess 5).
     - **Full absent list**: A, C, D, H, I, L, M, N, P, S, T, U, W.
   - **Secret Word Structure**:  
     The word must be `_ O _ E R` (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
     Positions 1 and 3 are unknown and must use letters **not in the absent list**.
   - **Available Letters**:  
     B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z (prioritize common letters: B, F, G, V, Y).

2. **Narrowing Possibilities**:
   - The secret word is `X O Y E R`, where:
     - **X** (position 1) and **Y** (position 3) are unknown letters from the available set.
     - Valid words include: **BOXER** (B, X), **FOYER** (F, Y), **JOKER** (J, K), **VOTER** (V, T – but T is absent, so invalid), **GONER** (G, N – but N absent, invalid).
   - Guess 5 (COMER) ruled out C and M, leaving no new clues for positions 1/3.

3. **Strategy for Final Guess (6th Attempt)**:
   - We have 1 guess left. Prioritize a word that:
     - Fits `_ O _ E R`.
     - Tests high-frequency available letters (e.g., B, F, Y).
     - Is a common English word.
   - **""FOYER""** is chosen because:
     - Tests **F** (position 1) and **Y** (position 3), both plausible and untested.
     - ""FOYER"" (meaning an entrance hall) is a valid 5-letter word.
     - If incorrect, feedback on F/Y will reveal the solution (e.g., if F absent, then X must be B/G/J, etc.).

**Guess 1: RAISE**

- R: correct at position 5

**Guess 5: COMER**

   - Position 4: E (from Guess 2, 4, 5)
   - Position 5: R (from Guess 4 and 5)

2. **Absent Letters**:
   - From all guesses: A, I, S, T, H, W, P, U, D, L, N, C, M
   - Full list: A, C, D, H, I, L, M, N, P, S, T, U, W

3. **Present Letters**:
   - R, E, O are fixed and known.
   - The only other present letter must be for position 1 and 3, but we have no other known present letters. Since the word has 5 letters, and we have O, E, R fixed, the other two positions (1 and 3) must be filled with two new letters that are not absent.

4. **Secret Word Structure**:
   - The word is `X O Y E R`, where X is position 1 and Y is position 3.
   - X and Y must be letters not in the absent list and not O, E, R (since those are fixed and we don't have duplicates indicated).

5. **Available Letters**:
   - Remaining letters: B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z (and possibly others, but common ones: B, F, G, V, Y)

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- We need to guess a word of the form `X O Y E R` with X and Y from the available letters.
- Since we have only one guess left (6th guess), we must choose a word that could be the solution or narrow it down.
- Possible words: 
  - ""BOXER"": B O X E R → tests B and X
  - ""FOYER"": F O Y E R → tests F and Y
  - ""JOKER"": J O K E R → tests J and K
  - ""GONER"": but N is absent, invalid
  - ""COVER"": C is absent, invalid
  - ""HOMER"": H absent, invalid
  - ""POKER"": P absent, invalid

- Common options: ""BOXER"", ""FOYER"", ""JOKER"", ""VOTER"" (but T absent), etc.

- ""FOYER"" is a valid word (meaning an entrance hall) and uses F and Y, which are plausible.
- ""BOXER"" is also common (a type of dog or fighter).
- ""JOKER"" is common (playing card or person).

- Since we have no information, we can choose one arbitrarily. Let's pick ""FOYER"" to test F and Y.

### Final Guess:
- If ""FOYER"" is correct, we win. If not, we get feedback on F and Y, and can deduce the word in the next guess (but we have only one guess left? Actually, this is the 6th guess? We started with 1,2,3,4,5, so this is the 6th and final guess).

We have to make the best guess.

Alternatively, we can consider the frequency of letters. F is more common than J or X, so ""FOYER"" might be better.

But let's choose ""FOYER"".

<guess>FOYER</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Review Feedback and Deductions**:
   - **Fixed Positions** (from Guess 4 and 5):
     - Position 2: **O** (✓ in LONER and COMER).
     - Position 4: **E** (✓ in THREW, LONER, COMER).
     - Position 5: **R** (✓ in LONER and COMER).
   - **Absent Letters** (from all feedback):
     - A, I, S (Guess 1), T, H, W (Guess 2), P, U, D (Guess 3), L, N (Guess 4), C, M (Guess 5).
     - **Full absent list**: A, C, D, H, I, L, M, N, P, S, T, U, W.
   - **Secret Word Structure**:  
     The word must be `_ O _ E R` (positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  
     Positions 1 and 3 are unknown and must use letters **not in the absent list**.
   - **Available Letters**:  
     B, F, G, J, K, Q, V, X, Y, Z (prioritize common letters: B, F, G, V, Y).

2. **Narrowing Possibilities**:
   - The secret word is `X O Y E R`, where:
     - **X** (position 1) and **Y** (position 3) are unknown letters from the available set.
     - Valid words include: **BOXER** (B, X), **FOYER** (F, Y), **JOKER** (J, K), **VOTER** (V, T – but T is absent, so invalid), **GONER** (G, N – but N absent, invalid).
   - Guess 5 (COMER) ruled out C and M, leaving no new clues for positions 1/3.

3. **Strategy for Final Guess (6th Attempt)**:
   - We have 1 guess left. Prioritize a word that:
     - Fits `_ O _ E R`.
     - Tests high-frequency available letters (e.g., B, F, Y).
     - Is a common English word.
   - **""FOYER""** is chosen because:
     - Tests **F** (position 1) and **Y** (position 3), both plausible and untested.
     - ""FOYER"" (meaning an entrance hall) is a valid 5-letter word.
     - If incorrect, feedback on F/Y will reveal the solution (e.g., if F absent, then X must be B/G/J, etc.).",Guess 6: FOYER -> FEEDBACK: F(x) O(✓) Y(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
