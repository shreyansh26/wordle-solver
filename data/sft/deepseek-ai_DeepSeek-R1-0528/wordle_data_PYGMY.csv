We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

Okay, let me tackle this next guess. The previous feedback shows that none of the letters in ""crane"" are in the secret word. That means C, R, A, N, and E are all eliminated.

We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""stomp"" -> 
   - S, T, O are absent (x)
   - M is present and in the correct position (✓) -> so the 4th letter is M (since in ""stomp"", M is the 4th letter)
   - P is present but in the wrong position (-)

From ""stomp"" feedback:
- The 4th letter is M (because M got ✓, so it's correct and in position 4).
- P is somewhere in the word but not at the 5th position (since P was guessed at the 5th position and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but misplaced).

Therefore, the word has the letter M in the 4th position and the letter P somewhere (either in position 1, 2, 3, or not 5). But since P is misplaced at position 5, it must be in one of the first three positions? No, wait: because the positions are fixed. But note that the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
- Position 4: M

And we know the word contains the letter P, but it's not at position 5. Also, because we got a ""-"" for P at position 5, P must be present somewhere else (either position 1,2,3). However, note that it could potentially be in the other positions except 4 (which is M) and 5 (since it was misplaced). But we don't know positions 1,2,3,5 yet.

But also, from ""crane"" we know C,R,A,N,E are absent.

Now, in ""stomp"", we also learned S,T,O are absent.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O.

Present letters we know: M and P (and M is fixed at position 4, and P is somewhere not at 5).

Therefore, the word must contain P and M, and three other letters that are not among the absent ones.

Now, we need to form a word of 5 letters that has M at position 4 and P in one of positions 1,2,3 (since not 4 or 5). But wait, it could be at position 5? But in the feedback for ""stomp"", P was at position 5 and got ""-"", which means P is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, P is NOT at position 5. Therefore, P must be in position 1,2, or 3.

Also, the word must have an M at position 4.

So our word structure: 
- Position 1: unknown, but must be a letter not in {C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O}, and it could be P? yes
- Position 2: unknown, not in the absent set, could be P? yes
- Position 3: unknown, not in the absent set, could be P? yes
- Position 4: M (fixed)
- Position 5: unknown, but not any of the absent letters and cannot be P (since P isn't at 5). Also, because we know P is in the word, position 5 is a different letter.

Now, what letters are available? The alphabet excluding absent: 
Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O.

So available letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note M and P are already used, but they can appear in the word multiple times? Feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates. We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in ""stomp"" we only have one P and one M. The feedback for M was ✓ and for P was -, so M was correctly placed and P is present elsewhere. So duplicate letters: if the word has two Ps, it's possible? But our feedback only shows that there is at least one P, and it wasn't at position 5.

So, we need to think of a word that has M at position 4 and at least one P in positions 1,2, or 3.

Furthermore, we need a word that uses only the available letters.

Let me brainstorm words that have M as the fourth letter and P somewhere in front:

For example:
- Letter patterns: _ _ _ M _
We need P to be in one of the first three.

Possible words:

Consider common words:

- PLUM? But has L,U. U is available? Let's see: available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. Yes, U is available.

PLUM: if we think PLUM, but the positions: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: L
Position 3: U
Position 4: M -> fixed
Position 5: ? But PLUM only has 4 letters? PLUMM? Not valid. The word is 5 letters. So PLUM is 4 letters. Not valid.

5-letter words with M at 4:

I recall words like ""GRIME"", ""PRIME"", ""TRUMP"", etc., but note TRUMP contains R,T which are absent (from ""crane"" we have R and T absent). T is absent from ""stomp"" and ""crane"", R is absent from ""crane"".

TRUMP: position 4 is M? 
T R U M P -> position 4 is M? 
Position 1:T (absent, from stomp -> T is absent), position 2:R (absent from crane), position 4:M, position 5:P.

But T and R are absent, so no.

Similarly, let's look for words ending in ""M"". Actually, we are looking for words with M at position 4.

Examples of words with fourth letter M and containing P:

- ""GRUMP"": 
  G (1), R (2) -> R is absent (from crane), so no.
- ""CLAMP"": 
  C (1) -> absent (crane), L (2), A (3) -> absent (crane). Not good.
- ""PROM?"" But PROM is 4 letters? 
What about: ""PRISM""?
PRISM: positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5) -> but our M is at position 4, not 5. So no.

We need M at position 4.

Another one: ""CRAMP"" -> C and R absent.

""TEMPO"": but T and O absent.

Let's try words that have P in the beginning and M at the end? Position 4 is the third letter? Wait, indices: position 1,2,3,4,5.

So position 4 is M.

So words like: ...M.

Common patterns: 
- Words ending with ""M"": so the fifth letter would be ...? But position 4 is M, then position 5 is something.

For example: ""DOGMA"" -> positions: D(1), O(2) -> absent? O is absent (from stomp), G(3), M(4), A(5) -> A absent.

Not suitable.

""GUMMY"": but has double M? Position 4 is M, so if we say G U M M Y, but then position 4 is the second M? Let's count:
1: G
2: U
3: M
4: M? -> wait, but we need M at position 4, so the fourth letter must be M. In ""GUMMY"", position 3 is M and position 4 is M? Actually, G-U-M-M-Y: so position 3: M, position 4: M, position 5: Y. Actually, positions: 
1: G
2: U
3: M
4: M
5: Y

But for ""GUMMY"", if the secret word had M at position 4, then our guess ""stomp"" had M at position 4 which matched. But ""GUMMY"" has M at position 3 as well? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters. But we don't know for sure.

However, in our feedback for ""stomp"", we only have M at position 4 and P at position 5 (which was misplaced). For ""GUMMY"", M is at positions 3 and 4. So if the secret word has M only at position 4, then when we guessed ""stomp"" which has M only at position 4, it's correct.

But if the secret word had double M, like ""GUMMY"", then in ""stomp"", we guessed M at position 4 which is correct (since there is an M at position 4), and the second M? Well, we didn't guess M at other positions, so feedback would still only show the correct for position 4. Similarly, for P, in ""GUMMY"", there is no P, but our feedback from ""stomp"" said P was present. So if the secret word is ""GUMMY"", it doesn't have P, but feedback said P is present. Therefore, the word must have P.

Therefore, ""GUMMY"" doesn't have P, so it's invalid.

Back to available letters: 
Possible words: 
Think of a word with P and M at position 4.

Common words: 
""OPIUM""? 
O is absent (from stomp), so positions: O(1) absent, P(2), I(3), U(4)? M is position 4? Actually, O-P-I-U-M: position 4 is U? Then position 5: M. But we need M at position 4, not 5.

""PRIM?"" Only 4 letters.

""PRIME"": 
P(1), R(2) -> R absent? From ""crane"", R is absent. Yes, so R not allowed.

""PLUMB""?
P(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), B(5) -> yes, that looks good.

Letters: P, L, U, M, B.
Check absent letters: L, U, B are all available? 
Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O -> none of L,U,B in there.

So ""PLUMB"" seems like a candidate.

Another one: ""GUIMP""? Not a common word.

""PLUMY""? Not standard.

Or ""BIOM?"" Not 5 letters.

Another common word: ""CLIMB""? 
C is absent? From ""crane"", C absent.

But we have ""PLUMB"" which seems valid.

Also, ""CRUMB""? C is absent.

So ""PLUMB"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
We guess ""PLUMB"", meaning:
- Position 1: P -> if the word has P, and we are putting P at position 1, which must be correct if P is at position 1? We don't know. But we know P is in the word, but not at position 5. It could be at position 1.

We want to test? We might get a match.

Also, note that in ""stomp"", P was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning P is present and not at 5. So in ""PLUMB"", P is at position 1. If the word has P at position 1, we would get ✓. If P is at position 2, we would get a ""-"" for P at 1? That is, if P is at 2 or 3, then putting at 1 would give ""-"".

So with ""PLUMB"" we can quickly check.

Alternatively, another word: ""PRISM"" doesn't have M at 4.

""SPAM""? Only 4 letters.

""JUMPY"": 
J-U-M-P-Y -> positions: 
1:J, 2:U, 3:M, 4:P, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be M? So no.

""PUMMY""? Not a word.

So ""PLUMB"" looks promising.

Also, let's consider if there's a word with P at position 2 or 3.

For example, words with M at position 4 and P at position 2: 
? P ? M ? 
Like ""OPIUM"" but O absent, and structure incorrect.

Another: ""APPLE""? Has P at 1 and 2? But also A and E absent? A and E absent from crane.

Not good.

Words with P at position 3: 
? ? P M ? 
Like ""WHUMP""? Not common? ""CHUMP"" has C and H? C absent, H available? Available letters: H is allowed. But C absent? CHUMP: C at 1, absent.

""THUMP"": T is absent? Wait, T is absent from ""stomp"".

Not good.

Therefore, ""PLUMB"" seems one of the best words to guess.

Also, we can think of ""GYMP?"" Not a word.

So I will guess ""PLUMB"".

But let me list out: PLUMB is a valid English word meaning to measure depth? Also, we ensure all letters are available.

Yes.

Therefore, next guess: PLUMB.

We have tried ""crane"" and ""stomp"". Next is third guess.

So guess ""plumb"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- In ""crane"", all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.
- In ""stomp"", S, T, and O are absent; M is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4; P is present but misplaced (not in position 5).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must have M in position 4.
- The secret word includes P, but not in position 5—meaning P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O. All future guesses must avoid these.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The goal is to test the placement of P and verify other letters. A strategic guess is ""PLUMB"":
- P is in position 1 to test if it's correctly placed there.
- L, U, M, B are all available letters and fit the constraints.
- M is in position 4 (confirming its placement).
- This word efficiently tests for P in position 1, while introducing new common letters (L, U, B) for more feedback.

<guess>plumb</guess>",plumb,"We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""stomp"" -> 
   - S, T, O are absent (x)
   - M is present and in the correct position (✓) -> so the 4th letter is M (since in ""stomp"", M is the 4th letter)
   - P is present but in the wrong position (-)

From ""stomp"" feedback:
- The 4th letter is M (because M got ✓, so it's correct and in position 4).
- P is somewhere in the word but not at the 5th position (since P was guessed at the 5th position and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but misplaced).

Therefore, the word has the letter M in the 4th position and the letter P somewhere (either in position 1, 2, 3, or not 5). But since P is misplaced at position 5, it must be in one of the first three positions? No, wait: because the positions are fixed. But note that the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
- Position 4: M

And we know the word contains the letter P, but it's not at position 5. Also, because we got a ""-"" for P at position 5, P must be present somewhere else (either position 1,2,3). However, note that it could potentially be in the other positions except 4 (which is M) and 5 (since it was misplaced). But we don't know positions 1,2,3,5 yet.

But also, from ""crane"" we know C,R,A,N,E are absent.

Now, in ""stomp"", we also learned S,T,O are absent.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O.

Present letters we know: M and P (and M is fixed at position 4, and P is somewhere not at 5).

Therefore, the word must contain P and M, and three other letters that are not among the absent ones.

Now, we need to form a word of 5 letters that has M at position 4 and P in one of positions 1,2,3 (since not 4 or 5). But wait, it could be at position 5? But in the feedback for ""stomp"", P was at position 5 and got ""-"", which means P is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, P is NOT at position 5. Therefore, P must be in position 1,2, or 3.

Also, the word must have an M at position 4.

So our word structure: 
- Position 1: unknown, but must be a letter not in {C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O}, and it could be P? yes
- Position 2: unknown, not in the absent set, could be P? yes
- Position 3: unknown, not in the absent set, could be P? yes
- Position 4: M (fixed)
- Position 5: unknown, but not any of the absent letters and cannot be P (since P isn't at 5). Also, because we know P is in the word, position 5 is a different letter.

Now, what letters are available? The alphabet excluding absent: 
Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O.

So available letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note M and P are already used, but they can appear in the word multiple times? Feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates. We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in ""stomp"" we only have one P and one M. The feedback for M was ✓ and for P was -, so M was correctly placed and P is present elsewhere. So duplicate letters: if the word has two Ps, it's possible? But our feedback only shows that there is at least one P, and it wasn't at position 5.

So, we need to think of a word that has M at position 4 and at least one P in positions 1,2, or 3.

Furthermore, we need a word that uses only the available letters.

Let me brainstorm words that have M as the fourth letter and P somewhere in front:

For example:
- Letter patterns: _ _ _ M _
We need P to be in one of the first three.

Possible words:

Consider common words:

- PLUM? But has L,U. U is available? Let's see: available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. Yes, U is available.

PLUM: if we think PLUM, but the positions: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: L
Position 3: U
Position 4: M -> fixed
Position 5: ? But PLUM only has 4 letters? PLUMM? Not valid. The word is 5 letters. So PLUM is 4 letters. Not valid.

5-letter words with M at 4:

I recall words like ""GRIME"", ""PRIME"", ""TRUMP"", etc., but note TRUMP contains R,T which are absent (from ""crane"" we have R and T absent). T is absent from ""stomp"" and ""crane"", R is absent from ""crane"".

TRUMP: position 4 is M? 
T R U M P -> position 4 is M? 
Position 1:T (absent, from stomp -> T is absent), position 2:R (absent from crane), position 4:M, position 5:P.

But T and R are absent, so no.

Similarly, let's look for words ending in ""M"". Actually, we are looking for words with M at position 4.

Examples of words with fourth letter M and containing P:

- ""GRUMP"": 
  G (1), R (2) -> R is absent (from crane), so no.
- ""CLAMP"": 
  C (1) -> absent (crane), L (2), A (3) -> absent (crane). Not good.
- ""PROM?"" But PROM is 4 letters? 
What about: ""PRISM""?
PRISM: positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5) -> but our M is at position 4, not 5. So no.

We need M at position 4.

Another one: ""CRAMP"" -> C and R absent.

""TEMPO"": but T and O absent.

Let's try words that have P in the beginning and M at the end? Position 4 is the third letter? Wait, indices: position 1,2,3,4,5.

So position 4 is M.

So words like: ...M.

Common patterns: 
- Words ending with ""M"": so the fifth letter would be ...? But position 4 is M, then position 5 is something.

For example: ""DOGMA"" -> positions: D(1), O(2) -> absent? O is absent (from stomp), G(3), M(4), A(5) -> A absent.

Not suitable.

""GUMMY"": but has double M? Position 4 is M, so if we say G U M M Y, but then position 4 is the second M? Let's count:
1: G
2: U
3: M
4: M? -> wait, but we need M at position 4, so the fourth letter must be M. In ""GUMMY"", position 3 is M and position 4 is M? Actually, G-U-M-M-Y: so position 3: M, position 4: M, position 5: Y. Actually, positions: 
1: G
2: U
3: M
4: M
5: Y

But for ""GUMMY"", if the secret word had M at position 4, then our guess ""stomp"" had M at position 4 which matched. But ""GUMMY"" has M at position 3 as well? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters. But we don't know for sure.

However, in our feedback for ""stomp"", we only have M at position 4 and P at position 5 (which was misplaced). For ""GUMMY"", M is at positions 3 and 4. So if the secret word has M only at position 4, then when we guessed ""stomp"" which has M only at position 4, it's correct.

But if the secret word had double M, like ""GUMMY"", then in ""stomp"", we guessed M at position 4 which is correct (since there is an M at position 4), and the second M? Well, we didn't guess M at other positions, so feedback would still only show the correct for position 4. Similarly, for P, in ""GUMMY"", there is no P, but our feedback from ""stomp"" said P was present. So if the secret word is ""GUMMY"", it doesn't have P, but feedback said P is present. Therefore, the word must have P.

Therefore, ""GUMMY"" doesn't have P, so it's invalid.

Back to available letters: 
Possible words: 
Think of a word with P and M at position 4.

Common words: 
""OPIUM""? 
O is absent (from stomp), so positions: O(1) absent, P(2), I(3), U(4)? M is position 4? Actually, O-P-I-U-M: position 4 is U? Then position 5: M. But we need M at position 4, not 5.

""PRIM?"" Only 4 letters.

""PRIME"": 
P(1), R(2) -> R absent? From ""crane"", R is absent. Yes, so R not allowed.

""PLUMB""?
P(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), B(5) -> yes, that looks good.

Letters: P, L, U, M, B.
Check absent letters: L, U, B are all available? 
Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O -> none of L,U,B in there.

So ""PLUMB"" seems like a candidate.

Another one: ""GUIMP""? Not a common word.

""PLUMY""? Not standard.

Or ""BIOM?"" Not 5 letters.

Another common word: ""CLIMB""? 
C is absent? From ""crane"", C absent.

But we have ""PLUMB"" which seems valid.

Also, ""CRUMB""? C is absent.

So ""PLUMB"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
We guess ""PLUMB"", meaning:
- Position 1: P -> if the word has P, and we are putting P at position 1, which must be correct if P is at position 1? We don't know. But we know P is in the word, but not at position 5. It could be at position 1.

We want to test? We might get a match.

Also, note that in ""stomp"", P was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning P is present and not at 5. So in ""PLUMB"", P is at position 1. If the word has P at position 1, we would get ✓. If P is at position 2, we would get a ""-"" for P at 1? That is, if P is at 2 or 3, then putting at 1 would give ""-"".

So with ""PLUMB"" we can quickly check.

Alternatively, another word: ""PRISM"" doesn't have M at 4.

""SPAM""? Only 4 letters.

""JUMPY"": 
J-U-M-P-Y -> positions: 
1:J, 2:U, 3:M, 4:P, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be M? So no.

""PUMMY""? Not a word.

So ""PLUMB"" looks promising.

Also, let's consider if there's a word with P at position 2 or 3.

For example, words with M at position 4 and P at position 2: 
? P ? M ? 
Like ""OPIUM"" but O absent, and structure incorrect.

Another: ""APPLE""? Has P at 1 and 2? But also A and E absent? A and E absent from crane.

Not good.

Words with P at position 3: 
? ? P M ? 
Like ""WHUMP""? Not common? ""CHUMP"" has C and H? C absent, H available? Available letters: H is allowed. But C absent? CHUMP: C at 1, absent.

""THUMP"": T is absent? Wait, T is absent from ""stomp"".

Not good.

Therefore, ""PLUMB"" seems one of the best words to guess.

Also, we can think of ""GYMP?"" Not a word.

So I will guess ""PLUMB"".

But let me list out: PLUMB is a valid English word meaning to measure depth? Also, we ensure all letters are available.

Yes.

Therefore, next guess: PLUMB.

We have tried ""crane"" and ""stomp"". Next is third guess.

So guess ""plumb"".Based on the previous feedback:
- In ""crane"", all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.
- In ""stomp"", S, T, and O are absent; M is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4; P is present but misplaced (not in position 5).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must have M in position 4.
- The secret word includes P, but not in position 5—meaning P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O. All future guesses must avoid these.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The goal is to test the placement of P and verify other letters. A strategic guess is ""PLUMB"":
- P is in position 1 to test if it's correctly placed there.
- L, U, M, B are all available letters and fit the constraints.
- M is in position 4 (confirming its placement).
- This word efficiently tests for P in position 1, while introducing new common letters (L, U, B) for more feedback.",Guess 3: plumb -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(x) U(x) M(✓) B(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,PYGMY,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, let me tackle this next guess. The previous feedback shows that none of the letters in ""crane"" are in the secret word. That means C, R, A, N, and E are all eliminated. 

Hmm, that's actually quite helpful because it narrows down the possible letters significantly. I need to choose a word that avoids these letters entirely. 

The alphabet minus C, R, A, N, E leaves us with letters like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

I should pick something common and with varied letters. ""Stomp"" comes to mind - S, T, O, M, P. None of these were in ""crane"", so they're all possible candidates. 

Let me double-check: S isn't C/R/A/N/E, same for T, O, M, P. Perfect. This will efficiently test five new common letters. 

If any match, the feedback will help triangulate further. If not, it eliminates more letters.After the feedback for ""crane"" showed that none of the letters (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word, all future guesses must exclude these letters. For a second guess, I should choose a word with entirely new, common letters to maximize information. ""Stomp"" uses five frequent consonants (S, T, M, P) and a vowel (O), all untested, making it a strong candidate to probe for matching letters.

<guess>stomp</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stomp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) M(✓) P(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""stomp"" -> 
   - S, T, O are absent (x)
   - M is present and in the correct position (✓) -> so the 4th letter is M (since in ""stomp"", M is the 4th letter)
   - P is present but in the wrong position (-)

From ""stomp"" feedback:
- The 4th letter is M (because M got ✓, so it's correct and in position 4).
- P is somewhere in the word but not at the 5th position (since P was guessed at the 5th position and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but misplaced).

Therefore, the word has the letter M in the 4th position and the letter P somewhere (either in position 1, 2, 3, or not 5). But since P is misplaced at position 5, it must be in one of the first three positions? No, wait: because the positions are fixed. But note that the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
- Position 4: M

And we know the word contains the letter P, but it's not at position 5. Also, because we got a ""-"" for P at position 5, P must be present somewhere else (either position 1,2,3). However, note that it could potentially be in the other positions except 4 (which is M) and 5 (since it was misplaced). But we don't know positions 1,2,3,5 yet.

But also, from ""crane"" we know C,R,A,N,E are absent.

Now, in ""stomp"", we also learned S,T,O are absent.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O.

Present letters we know: M and P (and M is fixed at position 4, and P is somewhere not at 5).

Therefore, the word must contain P and M, and three other letters that are not among the absent ones.

Now, we need to form a word of 5 letters that has M at position 4 and P in one of positions 1,2,3 (since not 4 or 5). But wait, it could be at position 5? But in the feedback for ""stomp"", P was at position 5 and got ""-"", which means P is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, P is NOT at position 5. Therefore, P must be in position 1,2, or 3.

Also, the word must have an M at position 4.

So our word structure: 
- Position 1: unknown, but must be a letter not in {C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O}, and it could be P? yes
- Position 2: unknown, not in the absent set, could be P? yes
- Position 3: unknown, not in the absent set, could be P? yes
- Position 4: M (fixed)
- Position 5: unknown, but not any of the absent letters and cannot be P (since P isn't at 5). Also, because we know P is in the word, position 5 is a different letter.

Now, what letters are available? The alphabet excluding absent: 
Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O.

So available letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note M and P are already used, but they can appear in the word multiple times? Feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates. We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in ""stomp"" we only have one P and one M. The feedback for M was ✓ and for P was -, so M was correctly placed and P is present elsewhere. So duplicate letters: if the word has two Ps, it's possible? But our feedback only shows that there is at least one P, and it wasn't at position 5.

So, we need to think of a word that has M at position 4 and at least one P in positions 1,2, or 3.

Furthermore, we need a word that uses only the available letters.

Let me brainstorm words that have M as the fourth letter and P somewhere in front:

For example:
- Letter patterns: _ _ _ M _
We need P to be in one of the first three.

Possible words:

Consider common words:

- PLUM? But has L,U. U is available? Let's see: available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. Yes, U is available.

PLUM: if we think PLUM, but the positions: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: L
Position 3: U
Position 4: M -> fixed
Position 5: ? But PLUM only has 4 letters? PLUMM? Not valid. The word is 5 letters. So PLUM is 4 letters. Not valid.

5-letter words with M at 4:

I recall words like ""GRIME"", ""PRIME"", ""TRUMP"", etc., but note TRUMP contains R,T which are absent (from ""crane"" we have R and T absent). T is absent from ""stomp"" and ""crane"", R is absent from ""crane"".

TRUMP: position 4 is M? 
T R U M P -> position 4 is M? 
Position 1:T (absent, from stomp -> T is absent), position 2:R (absent from crane), position 4:M, position 5:P.

But T and R are absent, so no.

Similarly, let's look for words ending in ""M"". Actually, we are looking for words with M at position 4.

Examples of words with fourth letter M and containing P:

- ""GRUMP"": 
  G (1), R (2) -> R is absent (from crane), so no.
- ""CLAMP"": 
  C (1) -> absent (crane), L (2), A (3) -> absent (crane). Not good.
- ""PROM?"" But PROM is 4 letters? 
What about: ""PRISM""?
PRISM: positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5) -> but our M is at position 4, not 5. So no.

We need M at position 4.

Another one: ""CRAMP"" -> C and R absent.

""TEMPO"": but T and O absent.

Let's try words that have P in the beginning and M at the end? Position 4 is the third letter? Wait, indices: position 1,2,3,4,5.

So position 4 is M.

So words like: ...M.

Common patterns: 
- Words ending with ""M"": so the fifth letter would be ...? But position 4 is M, then position 5 is something.

For example: ""DOGMA"" -> positions: D(1), O(2) -> absent? O is absent (from stomp), G(3), M(4), A(5) -> A absent.

Not suitable.

""GUMMY"": but has double M? Position 4 is M, so if we say G U M M Y, but then position 4 is the second M? Let's count:
1: G
2: U
3: M
4: M? -> wait, but we need M at position 4, so the fourth letter must be M. In ""GUMMY"", position 3 is M and position 4 is M? Actually, G-U-M-M-Y: so position 3: M, position 4: M, position 5: Y. Actually, positions: 
1: G
2: U
3: M
4: M
5: Y

But for ""GUMMY"", if the secret word had M at position 4, then our guess ""stomp"" had M at position 4 which matched. But ""GUMMY"" has M at position 3 as well? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters. But we don't know for sure.

However, in our feedback for ""stomp"", we only have M at position 4 and P at position 5 (which was misplaced). For ""GUMMY"", M is at positions 3 and 4. So if the secret word has M only at position 4, then when we guessed ""stomp"" which has M only at position 4, it's correct.

But if the secret word had double M, like ""GUMMY"", then in ""stomp"", we guessed M at position 4 which is correct (since there is an M at position 4), and the second M? Well, we didn't guess M at other positions, so feedback would still only show the correct for position 4. Similarly, for P, in ""GUMMY"", there is no P, but our feedback from ""stomp"" said P was present. So if the secret word is ""GUMMY"", it doesn't have P, but feedback said P is present. Therefore, the word must have P.

Therefore, ""GUMMY"" doesn't have P, so it's invalid.

Back to available letters: 
Possible words: 
Think of a word with P and M at position 4.

Common words: 
""OPIUM""? 
O is absent (from stomp), so positions: O(1) absent, P(2), I(3), U(4)? M is position 4? Actually, O-P-I-U-M: position 4 is U? Then position 5: M. But we need M at position 4, not 5.

""PRIM?"" Only 4 letters.

""PRIME"": 
P(1), R(2) -> R absent? From ""crane"", R is absent. Yes, so R not allowed.

""PLUMB""?
P(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), B(5) -> yes, that looks good.

Letters: P, L, U, M, B.
Check absent letters: L, U, B are all available? 
Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O -> none of L,U,B in there.

So ""PLUMB"" seems like a candidate.

Another one: ""GUIMP""? Not a common word.

""PLUMY""? Not standard.

Or ""BIOM?"" Not 5 letters.

Another common word: ""CLIMB""? 
C is absent? From ""crane"", C absent.

But we have ""PLUMB"" which seems valid.

Also, ""CRUMB""? C is absent.

So ""PLUMB"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
We guess ""PLUMB"", meaning:
- Position 1: P -> if the word has P, and we are putting P at position 1, which must be correct if P is at position 1? We don't know. But we know P is in the word, but not at position 5. It could be at position 1.

We want to test? We might get a match.

Also, note that in ""stomp"", P was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning P is present and not at 5. So in ""PLUMB"", P is at position 1. If the word has P at position 1, we would get ✓. If P is at position 2, we would get a ""-"" for P at 1? That is, if P is at 2 or 3, then putting at 1 would give ""-"".

So with ""PLUMB"" we can quickly check.

Alternatively, another word: ""PRISM"" doesn't have M at 4.

""SPAM""? Only 4 letters.

""JUMPY"": 
J-U-M-P-Y -> positions: 
1:J, 2:U, 3:M, 4:P, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be M? So no.

""PUMMY""? Not a word.

So ""PLUMB"" looks promising.

Also, let's consider if there's a word with P at position 2 or 3.

For example, words with M at position 4 and P at position 2: 
? P ? M ? 
Like ""OPIUM"" but O absent, and structure incorrect.

Another: ""APPLE""? Has P at 1 and 2? But also A and E absent? A and E absent from crane.

Not good.

Words with P at position 3: 
? ? P M ? 
Like ""WHUMP""? Not common? ""CHUMP"" has C and H? C absent, H available? Available letters: H is allowed. But C absent? CHUMP: C at 1, absent.

""THUMP"": T is absent? Wait, T is absent from ""stomp"".

Not good.

Therefore, ""PLUMB"" seems one of the best words to guess.

Also, we can think of ""GYMP?"" Not a word.

So I will guess ""PLUMB"".

But let me list out: PLUMB is a valid English word meaning to measure depth? Also, we ensure all letters are available.

Yes.

Therefore, next guess: PLUMB.

We have tried ""crane"" and ""stomp"". Next is third guess.

So guess ""plumb"".Based on the previous feedback:
- In ""crane"", all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.
- In ""stomp"", S, T, and O are absent; M is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4; P is present but misplaced (not in position 5).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must have M in position 4.
- The secret word includes P, but not in position 5—meaning P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O. All future guesses must avoid these.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The goal is to test the placement of P and verify other letters. A strategic guess is ""PLUMB"":
- P is in position 1 to test if it's correctly placed there.
- L, U, M, B are all available letters and fit the constraints.
- M is in position 4 (confirming its placement).
- This word efficiently tests for P in position 1, while introducing new common letters (L, U, B) for more feedback.

But since P is misplaced at position 5, it must be in one of the first three positions? No, wait: because the positions are fixed. But note that the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:\n- Position 4: M\n\nAnd we know the word contains the letter P, but it\'s not at position 5. Also, because we got a ""-"" for P at position 5, P must be present somewhere else (either position 1,2,3). However, note that it could potentially be in the other positions except 4 (which is M) and 5 (since it was misplaced). But we don\'t know positions 1,2,3,5 yet.\n\nBut also, from ""crane"" we know C,R,A,N,E are absent.\n\nNow, in ""stomp"", we also learned S,T,O are absent.\n\nSo absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O.\n\nPresent letters we know: M and P (and M is fixed at position 4, and P is somewhere not at 5).\n\nTherefore, the word must contain P and M, and three other letters that are not among the absent ones.\n\nNow, we need to form a word of 5 letters that has M at position 4 and P in one of positions 1,2,3 (since not 4 or 5). But wait, it could be at position 5? But in the feedback for ""stomp"", P was at position 5 and got ""-"", which means P is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, P is NOT at position 5. Therefore, P must be in position 1,2, or 3.\n\nAlso, the word must have an M at position 4.\n\nSo our word structure: \n- Position 1: unknown, but must be a letter not in {C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O}, and it could be P? yes\n- Position 2: unknown, not in the absent set, could be P? yes\n- Position 3: unknown, not in the absent set, could be P? yes\n- Position 4: M (fixed)\n- Position 5: unknown, but not any of the absent letters and cannot be P (since P isn\'t at 5). Also, because we know P is in the word, position 5 is a different letter.\n\nNow, what letters are available? The alphabet excluding absent: \nAbsent: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O.\n\nSo available letters: \nB, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note M and P are already used, but they can appear in the word multiple times? Feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicates. We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in ""stomp"" we only have one P and one M. The feedback for M was ✓ and for P was -, so M was correctly placed and P is present elsewhere. So duplicate letters: if the word has two Ps, it\'s possible? But our feedback only shows that there is at least one P, and it wasn\'t at position 5.\n\nSo, we need to think of a word that has M at position 4 and at least one P in positions 1,2, or 3.\n\nFurthermore, we need a word that uses only the available letters.\n\nLet me brainstorm words that have M as the fourth letter and P somewhere in front:\n\nFor example:\n- Letter patterns: _ _ _ M _\nWe need P to be in one of the first three.\n\nPossible words:\n\nConsider common words:\n\n- PLUM? But has L,U. U is available? Let\'s see: available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. Yes, U is available.\n\nPLUM: if we think PLUM, but the positions: \nPosition 1: P\nPosition 2: L\nPosition 3: U\nPosition 4: M -> fixed\nPosition 5: ? But PLUM only has 4 letters? PLUMM? Not valid. The word is 5 letters. So PLUM is 4 letters. Not valid.\n\n5-letter words with M at 4:\n\nI recall words like ""GRIME"", ""PRIME"", ""TRUMP"", etc., but note TRUMP contains R,T which are absent (from ""crane"" we have R and T absent). T is absent from ""stomp"" and ""crane"", R is absent from ""crane"".\n\nTRUMP: position 4 is M? \nT R U M P -> position 4 is M? \nPosition 1:T (absent, from stomp -> T is absent), position 2:R (absent from crane), position 4:M, position 5:P.\n\nBut T and R are absent, so no.\n\nSimilarly, let\'s look for words ending in ""M"". Actually, we are looking for words with M at position 4.\n\nExamples of words with fourth letter M and containing P:\n\n- ""GRUMP"": \n  G (1), R (2) -> R is absent (from crane), so no.\n- ""CLAMP"": \n  C (1) -> absent (crane), L (2), A (3) -> absent (crane). Not good.\n- ""PROM?"" But PROM is 4 letters? \nWhat about: ""PRISM""?\nPRISM: positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5) -> but our M is at position 4, not 5. So no.\n\nWe need M at position 4.\n\nAnother one: ""CRAMP"" -> C and R absent.\n\n""TEMPO"": but T and O absent.\n\nLet\'s try words that have P in the beginning and M at the end? Position 4 is the third letter? Wait, indices: position 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nSo position 4 is M.\n\nSo words like: ...M.\n\nCommon patterns: \n- Words ending with ""M"": so the fifth letter would be ...? But position 4 is M, then position 5 is something.\n\nFor example: ""DOGMA"" -> positions: D(1), O(2) -> absent? O is absent (from stomp), G(3), M(4), A(5) -> A absent.\n\nNot suitable.\n\n""GUMMY"": but has double M? Position 4 is M, so if we say G U M M Y, but then position 4 is the second M? Let\'s count:\n1: G\n2: U\n3: M\n4: M? -> wait, but we need M at position 4, so the fourth letter must be M. In ""GUMMY"", position 3 is M and position 4 is M? Actually, G-U-M-M-Y: so position 3: M, position 4: M, position 5: Y. Actually, positions: \n1: G\n2: U\n3: M\n4: M\n5: Y\n\nBut for ""GUMMY"", if the secret word had M at position 4, then our guess ""stomp"" had M at position 4 which matched. But ""GUMMY"" has M at position 3 as well? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicate letters. But we don\'t know for sure.\n\nHowever, in our feedback for ""stomp"", we only have M at position 4 and P at position 5 (which was misplaced). For ""GUMMY"", M is at positions 3 and 4. So if the secret word has M only at position 4, then when we guessed ""stomp"" which has M only at position 4, it\'s correct.\n\nBut if the secret word had double M, like ""GUMMY"", then in ""stomp"", we guessed M at position 4 which is correct (since there is an M at position 4), and the second M? Well, we didn\'t guess M at other positions, so feedback would still only show the correct for position 4. Similarly, for P, in ""GUMMY"", there is no P, but our feedback from ""stomp"" said P was present. So if the secret word is ""GUMMY"", it doesn\'t have P, but feedback said P is present. Therefore, the word must have P.\n\nTherefore, ""GUMMY"" doesn\'t have P, so it\'s invalid.\n\nBack to available letters: \nPossible words: \nThink of a word with P and M at position 4.\n\nCommon words: \n""OPIUM""? \nO is absent (from stomp), so positions: O(1) absent, P(2), I(3), U(4)? M is position 4? Actually, O-P-I-U-M: position 4 is U? Then position 5: M. But we need M at position 4, not 5.\n\n""PRIM?"" Only 4 letters.\n\n""PRIME"": \nP(1), R(2) -> R absent? From ""crane"", R is absent. Yes, so R not allowed.\n\n""PLUMB""?\nP(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), B(5) -> yes, that looks good.\n\nLetters: P, L, U, M, B.\nCheck absent letters: L, U, B are all available? \nAbsent: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O -> none of L,U,B in there.\n\nSo ""PLUMB"" seems like a candidate.\n\nAnother one: ""GUIMP""? Not a common word.\n\n""PLUMY""? Not standard.\n\nOr ""BIOM?"" Not 5 letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""CLIMB""? \nC is absent? From ""crane"", C absent.\n\nBut we have ""PLUMB"" which seems valid.\n\nAlso, ""CRUMB""? C is absent.\n\nSo ""PLUMB"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: \nWe guess ""PLUMB"", meaning:\n- Position 1: P -> if the word has P, and we are putting P at position 1, which must be correct if P is at position 1? We don\'t know. But we know P is in the word, but not at position 5. It could be at position 1.\n\nWe want to test? We might get a match.\n\nAlso, note that in ""stomp"", P was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning P is present and not at 5. So in ""PLUMB"", P is at position 1. If the word has P at position 1, we would get ✓. If P is at position 2, we would get a ""-"" for P at 1? That is, if P is at 2 or 3, then putting at 1 would give ""-"".\n\nSo with ""PLUMB"" we can quickly check.\n\nAlternatively, another word: ""PRISM"" doesn\'t have M at 4.\n\n""SPAM""? Only 4 letters.\n\n""JUMPY"": \nJ-U-M-P-Y -> positions: \n1:J, 2:U, 3:M, 4:P, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be M? So no.\n\n""PUMMY""? Not a word.\n\nSo ""PLUMB"" looks promising.\n\nAlso, let\'s consider if there\'s a word with P at position 2 or 3.\n\nFor example, words with M at position 4 and P at position 2: \n? P ? M ? \nLike ""OPIUM"" but O absent, and structure incorrect.\n\nAnother: ""APPLE""? Has P at 1 and 2? But also A and E absent? A and E absent from crane.\n\nNot good.\n\nWords with P at position 3: \n? ? P M ? \nLike ""WHUMP""? Not common? ""CHUMP"" has C and H? C absent, H available? Available letters: H is allowed. But C absent? CHUMP: C at 1, absent.\n\n""THUMP"": T is absent? Wait, T is absent from ""stomp"".\n\nNot good.\n\nTherefore, ""PLUMB"" seems one of the best words to guess.\n\nAlso, we can think of ""GYMP?"" Not a word.\n\nSo I will guess ""PLUMB"".\n\nBut let me list out: PLUMB is a valid English word meaning to measure depth? Also, we ensure all letters are available.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, next guess: PLUMB.\n\nWe have tried ""crane"" and ""stomp"". Next is third guess.\n\nSo guess ""plumb"".Based on the previous feedback:\n- In ""crane"", all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.\n- In ""stomp"", S, T, and O are absent; M is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4; P is present but misplaced (not in position 5).\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word must have M in position 4.\n- The secret word includes P, but not in position 5—meaning P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- Absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O. All future guesses must avoid these.\n- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nThe goal is to test the placement of P and verify other letters. A strategic guess is ""PLUMB"":\n- P is in position 1 to test if it\'s correctly placed there.\n- L, U, M, B are all available letters and fit the constraints.\n- M is in position 4 (confirming its placement).\n- This word efficiently tests for P in position 1, while introducing new common letters (L, U, B) for more feedback.\n\n<guess>plumb</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stomp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) M(✓) P(-)\nGuess 3: plumb -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(x) U(x) M(✓) B(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the third guess ""plumb"":
- P(✓): P is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- L(x): L is not in the word.
- U(x): U is not in the word.
- M(✓): M is correct and in the right position (position 4). We already knew this.
- B(x): B is not in the word.

So now we know:
- Position 1: P (fixed)
- Position 4: M (fixed)
- The word contains P and M (with P at position 1 and M at position 4).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L, U, B (from previous feedbacks).

Also, from ""stomp"", we knew P is present but not at position 5, and now we know it is at position 1.

Now, the word structure is:
Position 1: P
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not in the absent list)
Position 3: ? (must be a letter not in the absent list)
Position 4: M
Position 5: ? (must be a letter not in the absent list and not P, since P is at 1 and we don't know about duplicates, but we haven't seen any duplicates so far)

We also know that the word must have exactly 5 letters, and we have two unknown positions: 2, 3, and 5.

Available letters (excluding absent ones):
Absent: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L, U, B
So available: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: M and P are already in the word. We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't encountered any yet. Since we have P at position 1 and M at position 4, and the feedback for ""plumb"" showed that L, U, B are absent, we can assume that the word does not have duplicate P or M for now, unless feedback suggests otherwise.

Therefore, for positions 2, 3, and 5, we need to choose from the available letters excluding P and M? Not necessarily, because duplicates might be possible, but without evidence, it's safer to avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

But note: in the feedback for ""stomp"", we had M at position 4 correct and P at position 5 was misplaced. Now we know P is at position 1, so if the word had another P, it might have been indicated? But in ""stomp"", we only put P at position 5, and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one P, but it could be that there is only one P (at position 1) and that's why position 5 was marked as present but wrong. Similarly for M, we only have one M at position 4.

So to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

Therefore, for positions 2, 3, 5, we choose from: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since M and P are already used and we avoid duplicates).

Now, we need to form a word that starts with P, has M at position 4, and uses three distinct letters from the available set for positions 2,3,5.

Common words that fit:
- P _ _ M _
Examples: 
- ""PYGMY""? But G and Y are available? Let's check: 
  P(1), Y(2), G(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but Y is repeated? And we are avoiding duplicates. Also, position 5 is Y, which is available. But ""PYGMY"" has two Y's? Actually, ""PYGMY"" is a word? It's not standard. The word is ""PYGMY"" meaning a member of certain peoples, but it has 5 letters: P-Y-G-M-Y. So positions: 1:P, 2:Y, 3:G, 4:M, 5:Y. But we have two Y's. And we are avoiding duplicates? Also, in our available letters, Y is available. But we don't know if the word has duplicate Y. However, we are trying to avoid duplicates in our guess to get more information.

But we can consider it? But let's see if there are better options.

Another word: ""PAGED""? But A is absent? From ""crane"", A is absent.

""PIGMY"" is variant of ""PYGMY"", same issue.

""PIKED""? But E is absent? From ""crane"", E absent.

""PICKY""? C is absent? From ""crane"", C absent.

""PITHY"": 
P(1), I(2), T(3) -> T is absent? From ""stomp"", T is absent. So no.

""PINKY"": N is absent? From ""crane"", N absent.

""PUDGY"": U is absent? From ""plumb"", U absent.

""PADDY"": A and D? A absent? From ""crane"", A absent.

""PADDY"" has A, which is absent.

""PODGY"": O is absent? From ""stomp"", O absent.

""PIGGY"": G and Y? But has two G's? And we are avoiding duplicates? Also, G is available.

But let's list without duplicates.

Another: ""PIXIE""? But E is absent? And it has 5 letters: P-I-X-I-E -> but E absent and I repeated? Not good.

""PIXEL"": E and L? E absent and L absent? From ""plumb"", L absent.

""PINEY"": N and E absent? From ""crane"", both absent.

""PINEY"" is not possible.

""PICKY"": C and K? C absent? From ""crane"", C absent.

""PINKY"": N absent? From ""crane"", N absent.

""PARKA"": A and R and K? A and R absent? From ""crane"", both absent.

""PARKA"" not possible.

""PARKY"": A and R absent? Same.

""PARKY"" not standard.

""PADDY"": A absent.

""PADDY"" not possible.

""PUDGY"": U absent? From ""plumb"", U absent.

""PUDGY"" not possible.

""PUGGY"": U absent? And two G's? Not good.

""PIGGY"": two G's? And G is available? But we avoid duplicates.

""PIGGY"" is a word? Meaning like a pig, but informal.

But let's think of words with P, then two letters, then M, then one letter.

Common words: 
- ""PRISM"": but R and S absent? From ""crane"" R absent, ""stomp"" S absent? So no.
- ""PRIME"": R absent? From ""crane"", R absent.
- ""PLUME"": L and E absent? From ""plumb"", L absent, and ""crane"", E absent? So no.
- ""PLUMB"": we already tried, and L and B absent.

Another: ""PHASE"": H and A and E? A and E absent? From ""crane"", both absent.

""PHONE"": H, O, E? O absent from ""stomp"", E absent from ""crane""? So no.

""PHYME""? Not a word.

""PHYLA"": H, Y, L, A? L absent? From ""plumb"", L absent, and A absent? So no.

""PHYLA"" is plural of phylum, but L and A absent.

""DIARY"": but D, I, A, R, Y? A and R absent? So no.

We need to use available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to form words:

Possible: P, then one of [D,F,G,H,I,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z], then one of the same, then M, then one of the same.

For example:
- P, I, G, M, Y -> ""PIGMY"" (variant of pygmy) but not standard? Or ""PIGMY"" is accepted in some dictionaries? But it has 5 letters.

But we can use ""PIGMY"" if it's valid? But let's see if there's a better one.

Another: P, H, Y, M, S? But S absent? From ""stomp"", S absent.

P, H, Y, M, ? -> ""PHYMA""? Not a word.

P, I, M, M, ? -> but M at position 3? We need M at position 4, so position 3 cannot be M? Because we have M at position 4, and we are avoiding duplicates? So position 3 should not be M.

So position 3 must be a different letter.

Another: P, A, G, M, A? But A absent.

P, E, D, M, ? -> E absent.

P, I, D, M, ? -> ""PIDM?"" not a word.

P, I, K, M, ? -> ""PIKEM""? Not a word.

P, I, K, M, S -> but S absent.

P, I, K, M, Y -> ""PIKMY""? Not a word.

P, I, F, M, ? -> ""PIFM?"" not a word.

P, I, V, M, ? -> ""PIVMY""? Not a word.

P, I, G, M, Y -> ""PIGMY"" or ""PIGMY"" is sometimes written as ""pygmy"", which is 5 letters: P-Y-G-M-Y.

But in ""pygmy"", the letters are P, Y, G, M, Y. So it has two Y's? Actually, it's P-Y-G-M-Y, so positions: 1:P, 2:Y, 3:G, 4:M, 5:Y. So the letter Y is repeated.

But in our available letters, Y is available. And we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in our guess, we can use duplicate letters? But we are trying to avoid to get more information? But if we use duplicate, we might not get information about other letters.

But let's see: if we guess ""PYGMY"", we are testing Y at position 2 and 5, G at 3. If the word has Y, we might get feedback on both positions.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We have used 3, so we have 3 more? Wordle has 6 guesses.

But we want to be efficient.

Another word: ""PICKY"" not possible.

""PINKY"" not possible.

""PUNKY"": U absent? From ""plumb"", U absent.

""PECKY"": E absent.

""POCKY"": O absent.

""PECKY"" not possible.

""PACKY"": A absent.

""PACKY"" not possible.

""PADDY"" not possible.

""PUDGY"" not possible.

""PODGY"" not possible.

""PIGGY"": P-I-G-G-Y. This is a word? Informal for piggy bank or something. But it has two G's.

Positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:G, 4:G, 5:Y. But we need position 4 to be M, not G. So no.

We need position 4 to be M.

So ""PIGGY"" has G at position 4, not M.

Not good.

Another idea: ""PZAZZ""? Not a word, and Z repeated.

""PFFFT""? Not a word.

Let's think of words like ""PYXIS""? But S absent? And X and I? ""PYXIS"" has S, which is absent.

""PYXIS"" not possible.

""PYINS""? S absent.

""PYINS"" not possible.

""PIMPS"": S absent? And has two P's? But we have P at position 1, and if we put P at position 4? But position 4 is M, so not. ""PIMPS"" is P-I-M-P-S, so positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:M, 4:P, 5:S. But we need position 4 to be M, but in ""PIMPS"" position 4 is P, not M. So no.

""PJAMAS""? But A and S absent? A absent, S absent.

""PJAMAS"" not possible.

""PKdng"" not a word.

Perhaps I missed some words.

What about ""P D M"" with letters in between? Position 2 and 3 and 5.

For example, ""P D ? M ?"" but we need to fill.

""PDM"" is not a common start.

""POMBE"" not common.

""POMOS"": O and S? Both absent.

""POMOS"" not common.

""POMPY"": O and P? O absent, and P is at position 1, but we are avoiding duplicate P? ""POMPY"" has P at position 4? But position 4 is M, so not.

""POMPY"" is P-O-M-P-Y, so position 4 is P, not M. So no.

We need position 4 to be M.

So back to ""PYGMY"". It is a valid word and fits the pattern.

Another word: ""GYPPO""? But G and Y and P and O? O absent, and P is at position 1, but ""GYPPO"" has P at position 4? G-Y-P-P-O, position 4 is P, not M. So no.

""GYPPO"" not possible.

""PYGMY"" seems to be the only common word that fits.

Or ""PIGMY"", same thing.

So I think we have to go with ""PYGMY"".

But let's check the available letters: P, Y, G, M, Y. M is already used, but we are using it again at position 4, which is fixed. And Y is used twice.

In terms of feedback, it will tell us about Y and G.

If we guess ""PYGMY"", and the word is something else, we might get feedback.

Another word: ""P W Y M Y""? Not a word.

""P H Y M E""? Not a word.

""P I G M Y"" is the same as ""PYGMY"".

Perhaps ""P D G M D"" not a word.

I think ""PYGMY"" is our best bet.

So let's go with that.

Guess: ""PYGMY""

But in the response format, we need to output in <guess> tags.

So <guess>pygmy</guess>

But let's double-check the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""PYGMY"", then we win.

If not, we get feedback on Y at 2, G at 3, and Y at 5.

For example, if Y is in the word, we might get a match or misplaced.

Similarly for G.

But we have to try.

Another word: ""P D G M S"" but S absent.

""P D G M D"" not a word.

""P F G M F"" not.

""P H G M H"" not.

""P I G M I"" not a word.

""P J G M J"" not.

""P K G M K"" not.

""P Q G M Q"" not.

""P V G M V"" not.

""P W G M W"" not.

""P X G M X"" not.

""P Y G M Y"" is ""PYGMY"".

""P Z G M Z"" not a word.

So I think ""PYGMY"" is the only option.

Therefore, we guess ""pygmy"".
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. This eliminates these letters.
- **Guess 2: stomp** → S, T, O are absent; M is correct and in position 4; P is present but misplaced (not in position 5).
- **Guess 3: plumb** → P is correct and in position 1; L, U, B are absent; M is correct and in position 4 (already known).

### Key Deductions:
- **Position 1 is P** (from ""plumb"" feedback).
- **Position 4 is M** (from ""stomp"" and confirmed in ""plumb"").
- **P must be in position 1, 2, or 3** (from ""stomp"" feedback, P is present but not in position 5; now confirmed at position 1).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L, U, B (all eliminated from previous feedback).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (M and P are used but may have duplicates; however, no evidence of duplicates yet, so we avoid them for maximum information).
- **Word structure**: P _ _ M _ (positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown and must use available letters).

Given the constraints, the only common 5-letter English word that fits the pattern (P _ _ M _) and uses available letters is **PYGMY** (P-Y-G-M-Y). This guess tests:
- Y in positions 2 and 5.
- G in position 3.
- Confirms the fixed P and M positions.

If ""PYGMY"" is not the secret word, the feedback will provide critical information about Y and G, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>pygmy</guess>","tags.

So <guess>pygmy","We have the feedback from the third guess ""plumb"":
- P(✓): P is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- L(x): L is not in the word.
- U(x): U is not in the word.
- M(✓): M is correct and in the right position (position 4). We already knew this.
- B(x): B is not in the word.

So now we know:
- Position 1: P (fixed)
- Position 4: M (fixed)
- The word contains P and M (with P at position 1 and M at position 4).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L, U, B (from previous feedbacks).

Also, from ""stomp"", we knew P is present but not at position 5, and now we know it is at position 1.

Now, the word structure is:
Position 1: P
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not in the absent list)
Position 3: ? (must be a letter not in the absent list)
Position 4: M
Position 5: ? (must be a letter not in the absent list and not P, since P is at 1 and we don't know about duplicates, but we haven't seen any duplicates so far)

We also know that the word must have exactly 5 letters, and we have two unknown positions: 2, 3, and 5.

Available letters (excluding absent ones):
Absent: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L, U, B
So available: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: M and P are already in the word. We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't encountered any yet. Since we have P at position 1 and M at position 4, and the feedback for ""plumb"" showed that L, U, B are absent, we can assume that the word does not have duplicate P or M for now, unless feedback suggests otherwise.

Therefore, for positions 2, 3, and 5, we need to choose from the available letters excluding P and M? Not necessarily, because duplicates might be possible, but without evidence, it's safer to avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

But note: in the feedback for ""stomp"", we had M at position 4 correct and P at position 5 was misplaced. Now we know P is at position 1, so if the word had another P, it might have been indicated? But in ""stomp"", we only put P at position 5, and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one P, but it could be that there is only one P (at position 1) and that's why position 5 was marked as present but wrong. Similarly for M, we only have one M at position 4.

So to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

Therefore, for positions 2, 3, 5, we choose from: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since M and P are already used and we avoid duplicates).

Now, we need to form a word that starts with P, has M at position 4, and uses three distinct letters from the available set for positions 2,3,5.

Common words that fit:
- P _ _ M _
Examples: 
- ""PYGMY""? But G and Y are available? Let's check: 
  P(1), Y(2), G(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but Y is repeated? And we are avoiding duplicates. Also, position 5 is Y, which is available. But ""PYGMY"" has two Y's? Actually, ""PYGMY"" is a word? It's not standard. The word is ""PYGMY"" meaning a member of certain peoples, but it has 5 letters: P-Y-G-M-Y. So positions: 1:P, 2:Y, 3:G, 4:M, 5:Y. But we have two Y's. And we are avoiding duplicates? Also, in our available letters, Y is available. But we don't know if the word has duplicate Y. However, we are trying to avoid duplicates in our guess to get more information.

But we can consider it? But let's see if there are better options.

Another word: ""PAGED""? But A is absent? From ""crane"", A is absent.

""PIGMY"" is variant of ""PYGMY"", same issue.

""PIKED""? But E is absent? From ""crane"", E absent.

""PICKY""? C is absent? From ""crane"", C absent.

""PITHY"": 
P(1), I(2), T(3) -> T is absent? From ""stomp"", T is absent. So no.

""PINKY"": N is absent? From ""crane"", N absent.

""PUDGY"": U is absent? From ""plumb"", U absent.

""PADDY"": A and D? A absent? From ""crane"", A absent.

""PADDY"" has A, which is absent.

""PODGY"": O is absent? From ""stomp"", O absent.

""PIGGY"": G and Y? But has two G's? And we are avoiding duplicates? Also, G is available.

But let's list without duplicates.

Another: ""PIXIE""? But E is absent? And it has 5 letters: P-I-X-I-E -> but E absent and I repeated? Not good.

""PIXEL"": E and L? E absent and L absent? From ""plumb"", L absent.

""PINEY"": N and E absent? From ""crane"", both absent.

""PINEY"" is not possible.

""PICKY"": C and K? C absent? From ""crane"", C absent.

""PINKY"": N absent? From ""crane"", N absent.

""PARKA"": A and R and K? A and R absent? From ""crane"", both absent.

""PARKA"" not possible.

""PARKY"": A and R absent? Same.

""PARKY"" not standard.

""PADDY"": A absent.

""PADDY"" not possible.

""PUDGY"": U absent? From ""plumb"", U absent.

""PUDGY"" not possible.

""PUGGY"": U absent? And two G's? Not good.

""PIGGY"": two G's? And G is available? But we avoid duplicates.

""PIGGY"" is a word? Meaning like a pig, but informal.

But let's think of words with P, then two letters, then M, then one letter.

Common words: 
- ""PRISM"": but R and S absent? From ""crane"" R absent, ""stomp"" S absent? So no.
- ""PRIME"": R absent? From ""crane"", R absent.
- ""PLUME"": L and E absent? From ""plumb"", L absent, and ""crane"", E absent? So no.
- ""PLUMB"": we already tried, and L and B absent.

Another: ""PHASE"": H and A and E? A and E absent? From ""crane"", both absent.

""PHONE"": H, O, E? O absent from ""stomp"", E absent from ""crane""? So no.

""PHYME""? Not a word.

""PHYLA"": H, Y, L, A? L absent? From ""plumb"", L absent, and A absent? So no.

""PHYLA"" is plural of phylum, but L and A absent.

""DIARY"": but D, I, A, R, Y? A and R absent? So no.

We need to use available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to form words:

Possible: P, then one of [D,F,G,H,I,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z], then one of the same, then M, then one of the same.

For example:
- P, I, G, M, Y -> ""PIGMY"" (variant of pygmy) but not standard? Or ""PIGMY"" is accepted in some dictionaries? But it has 5 letters.

But we can use ""PIGMY"" if it's valid? But let's see if there's a better one.

Another: P, H, Y, M, S? But S absent? From ""stomp"", S absent.

P, H, Y, M, ? -> ""PHYMA""? Not a word.

P, I, M, M, ? -> but M at position 3? We need M at position 4, so position 3 cannot be M? Because we have M at position 4, and we are avoiding duplicates? So position 3 should not be M.

So position 3 must be a different letter.

Another: P, A, G, M, A? But A absent.

P, E, D, M, ? -> E absent.

P, I, D, M, ? -> ""PIDM?"" not a word.

P, I, K, M, ? -> ""PIKEM""? Not a word.

P, I, K, M, S -> but S absent.

P, I, K, M, Y -> ""PIKMY""? Not a word.

P, I, F, M, ? -> ""PIFM?"" not a word.

P, I, V, M, ? -> ""PIVMY""? Not a word.

P, I, G, M, Y -> ""PIGMY"" or ""PIGMY"" is sometimes written as ""pygmy"", which is 5 letters: P-Y-G-M-Y.

But in ""pygmy"", the letters are P, Y, G, M, Y. So it has two Y's? Actually, it's P-Y-G-M-Y, so positions: 1:P, 2:Y, 3:G, 4:M, 5:Y. So the letter Y is repeated.

But in our available letters, Y is available. And we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in our guess, we can use duplicate letters? But we are trying to avoid to get more information? But if we use duplicate, we might not get information about other letters.

But let's see: if we guess ""PYGMY"", we are testing Y at position 2 and 5, G at 3. If the word has Y, we might get feedback on both positions.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We have used 3, so we have 3 more? Wordle has 6 guesses.

But we want to be efficient.

Another word: ""PICKY"" not possible.

""PINKY"" not possible.

""PUNKY"": U absent? From ""plumb"", U absent.

""PECKY"": E absent.

""POCKY"": O absent.

""PECKY"" not possible.

""PACKY"": A absent.

""PACKY"" not possible.

""PADDY"" not possible.

""PUDGY"" not possible.

""PODGY"" not possible.

""PIGGY"": P-I-G-G-Y. This is a word? Informal for piggy bank or something. But it has two G's.

Positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:G, 4:G, 5:Y. But we need position 4 to be M, not G. So no.

We need position 4 to be M.

So ""PIGGY"" has G at position 4, not M.

Not good.

Another idea: ""PZAZZ""? Not a word, and Z repeated.

""PFFFT""? Not a word.

Let's think of words like ""PYXIS""? But S absent? And X and I? ""PYXIS"" has S, which is absent.

""PYXIS"" not possible.

""PILLY"": L absent? And L is in the word? Not possible.

""PILLY"" not possible.

""PILMY"": L absent? And M at position 4? ""PILMY"" would be P-I-L-M-Y, but L is absent, so not possible.

""PILMY"" not possible.

""PIMAS"": S absent? And A absent? So no.

""PIMAS"" not possible.

""PIMPS"": S absent? And has two P's? But we have P at position 1, and if we put P at position 4? But position 4 is M, so not. ""PIMPS"" is P-I-M-P-S, so positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:M, 4:P, 5:S. But we need position 4 to be M, but in ""PIMPS"" position 4 is P, not M. So no.

We need position 4 to be M.

So words like ""P_ _M_"".

""PHIZZ"" not valid.

""PJAMAS""? But A and S absent? A absent, S absent.

""PJAMAS"" not possible.

Perhaps I missed some words.

What about ""P D M"" with letters in between? Position 2 and 3 and 5.

For example, ""P D ? M ?"" but we need to fill.

""POMOS"": O and S? Both absent.

""POMOS"" not common.

""POMPY"": O and P? O absent, and P is at position 1, but we are avoiding duplicate P? ""POMPY"" has P at position 4? But position 4 is M, so not.

""POMPY"" is P-O-M-P-Y, so position 4 is P, not M. So no.

We need position 4 to be M.

So back to ""PYGMY"". It is a valid word and fits the pattern.

Another word: ""GYPPO""? But G and Y and P and O? O absent, and P is at position 1, but ""GYPPO"" has P at position 4? G-Y-P-P-O, position 4 is P, not M. So no.

""GYPPO"" not possible.

""PYGMY"" seems to be the only common word that fits.

Or ""PIGMY"", same thing.

So I think we have to go with ""PYGMY"".

But let's check the available letters: P, Y, G, M, Y. M is already used, but we are using it again at position 4, which is fixed. And Y is used twice.

In terms of feedback, it will tell us about Y and G.

If we guess ""PYGMY"", and the word is something else, we might get feedback.

Another word: ""P W Y M Y""? Not a word.

""P H Y M E""? Not a word.

""P I G M Y"" is the same as ""PYGMY"".

Perhaps ""P D G M D"" not a word.

I think ""PYGMY"" is our best bet.

So let's go with that.

Guess: ""PYGMY""

But in the response format, we need to output in <guess> tags.

So <guess>pygmy</guess>

But let's double-check the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""PYGMY"", then we win.

If not, we get feedback on Y at 2, G at 3, and Y at 5.

For example, if Y is in the word, we might get a match or misplaced.

Similarly for G.

But we have to try.

Another word: ""P D G M S"" but S absent.

""P D G M D"" not a word.

""P F G M F"" not.

""P H G M H"" not.

""P I G M I"" not a word.

""P J G M J"" not.

""P K G M K"" not.

""P Q G M Q"" not.

""P V G M V"" not.

""P W G M W"" not.

""P X G M X"" not.

""P Y G M Y"" is ""PYGMY"".

""P Z G M Z"" not a word.

So I think ""PYGMY"" is the only option.

Therefore, we guess ""pygmy"".After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. This eliminates these letters.
- **Guess 2: stomp** → S, T, O are absent; M is correct and in position 4; P is present but misplaced (not in position 5).
- **Guess 3: plumb** → P is correct and in position 1; L, U, B are absent; M is correct and in position 4 (already known).

### Key Deductions:
- **Position 1 is P** (from ""plumb"" feedback).
- **Position 4 is M** (from ""stomp"" and confirmed in ""plumb"").
- **P must be in position 1, 2, or 3** (from ""stomp"" feedback, P is present but not in position 5; now confirmed at position 1).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L, U, B (all eliminated from previous feedback).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (M and P are used but may have duplicates; however, no evidence of duplicates yet, so we avoid them for maximum information).
- **Word structure**: P _ _ M _ (positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown and must use available letters).

Given the constraints, the only common 5-letter English word that fits the pattern (P _ _ M _) and uses available letters is **PYGMY** (P-Y-G-M-Y). This guess tests:
- Y in positions 2 and 5.
- G in position 3.
- Confirms the fixed P and M positions.

If ""PYGMY"" is not the secret word, the feedback will provide critical information about Y and G, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.","Guess 4: tags.

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more possibilities.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all are distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>Okay, let me tackle this next guess. The previous feedback shows that none of the letters in ""crane"" are in the secret word. That means C, R, A, N, and E are all eliminated. 

Hmm, that's actually quite helpful because it narrows down the possible letters significantly. I need to choose a word that avoids these letters entirely. 

The alphabet minus C, R, A, N, E leaves us with letters like B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. 

I should pick something common and with varied letters. ""Stomp"" comes to mind - S, T, O, M, P. None of these were in ""crane"", so they're all possible candidates. 

Let me double-check: S isn't C/R/A/N/E, same for T, O, M, P. Perfect. This will efficiently test five new common letters. 

If any match, the feedback will help triangulate further. If not, it eliminates more letters.After the feedback for ""crane"" showed that none of the letters (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word, all future guesses must exclude these letters. For a second guess, I should choose a word with entirely new, common letters to maximize information. ""Stomp"" uses five frequent consonants (S, T, M, P) and a vowel (O), all untested, making it a strong candidate to probe for matching letters.

<guess>stomp</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stomp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) M(✓) P(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:
1. ""crane"" -> all letters are absent: C, R, A, N, E are not in the word.
2. ""stomp"" -> 
   - S, T, O are absent (x)
   - M is present and in the correct position (✓) -> so the 4th letter is M (since in ""stomp"", M is the 4th letter)
   - P is present but in the wrong position (-)

From ""stomp"" feedback:
- The 4th letter is M (because M got ✓, so it's correct and in position 4).
- P is somewhere in the word but not at the 5th position (since P was guessed at the 5th position and got a ""-"", meaning it's present but misplaced).

Therefore, the word has the letter M in the 4th position and the letter P somewhere (either in position 1, 2, 3, or not 5). But since P is misplaced at position 5, it must be in one of the first three positions? No, wait: because the positions are fixed. But note that the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:
- Position 4: M

And we know the word contains the letter P, but it's not at position 5. Also, because we got a ""-"" for P at position 5, P must be present somewhere else (either position 1,2,3). However, note that it could potentially be in the other positions except 4 (which is M) and 5 (since it was misplaced). But we don't know positions 1,2,3,5 yet.

But also, from ""crane"" we know C,R,A,N,E are absent.

Now, in ""stomp"", we also learned S,T,O are absent.

So absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O.

Present letters we know: M and P (and M is fixed at position 4, and P is somewhere not at 5).

Therefore, the word must contain P and M, and three other letters that are not among the absent ones.

Now, we need to form a word of 5 letters that has M at position 4 and P in one of positions 1,2,3 (since not 4 or 5). But wait, it could be at position 5? But in the feedback for ""stomp"", P was at position 5 and got ""-"", which means P is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, P is NOT at position 5. Therefore, P must be in position 1,2, or 3.

Also, the word must have an M at position 4.

So our word structure: 
- Position 1: unknown, but must be a letter not in {C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O}, and it could be P? yes
- Position 2: unknown, not in the absent set, could be P? yes
- Position 3: unknown, not in the absent set, could be P? yes
- Position 4: M (fixed)
- Position 5: unknown, but not any of the absent letters and cannot be P (since P isn't at 5). Also, because we know P is in the word, position 5 is a different letter.

Now, what letters are available? The alphabet excluding absent: 
Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O.

So available letters: 
B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note M and P are already used, but they can appear in the word multiple times? Feedback doesn't say anything about duplicates. We don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in ""stomp"" we only have one P and one M. The feedback for M was ✓ and for P was -, so M was correctly placed and P is present elsewhere. So duplicate letters: if the word has two Ps, it's possible? But our feedback only shows that there is at least one P, and it wasn't at position 5.

So, we need to think of a word that has M at position 4 and at least one P in positions 1,2, or 3.

Furthermore, we need a word that uses only the available letters.

Let me brainstorm words that have M as the fourth letter and P somewhere in front:

For example:
- Letter patterns: _ _ _ M _
We need P to be in one of the first three.

Possible words:

Consider common words:

- PLUM? But has L,U. U is available? Let's see: available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. Yes, U is available.

PLUM: if we think PLUM, but the positions: 
Position 1: P
Position 2: L
Position 3: U
Position 4: M -> fixed
Position 5: ? But PLUM only has 4 letters? PLUMM? Not valid. The word is 5 letters. So PLUM is 4 letters. Not valid.

5-letter words with M at 4:

I recall words like ""GRIME"", ""PRIME"", ""TRUMP"", etc., but note TRUMP contains R,T which are absent (from ""crane"" we have R and T absent). T is absent from ""stomp"" and ""crane"", R is absent from ""crane"".

TRUMP: position 4 is M? 
T R U M P -> position 4 is M? 
Position 1:T (absent, from stomp -> T is absent), position 2:R (absent from crane), position 4:M, position 5:P.

But T and R are absent, so no.

Similarly, let's look for words ending in ""M"". Actually, we are looking for words with M at position 4.

Examples of words with fourth letter M and containing P:

- ""GRUMP"": 
  G (1), R (2) -> R is absent (from crane), so no.
- ""CLAMP"": 
  C (1) -> absent (crane), L (2), A (3) -> absent (crane). Not good.
- ""PROM?"" But PROM is 4 letters? 
What about: ""PRISM""?
PRISM: positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5) -> but our M is at position 4, not 5. So no.

We need M at position 4.

Another one: ""CRAMP"" -> C and R absent.

""TEMPO"": but T and O absent.

Let's try words that have P in the beginning and M at the end? Position 4 is the third letter? Wait, indices: position 1,2,3,4,5.

So position 4 is M.

So words like: ...M.

Common patterns: 
- Words ending with ""M"": so the fifth letter would be ...? But position 4 is M, then position 5 is something.

For example: ""DOGMA"" -> positions: D(1), O(2) -> absent? O is absent (from stomp), G(3), M(4), A(5) -> A absent.

Not suitable.

""GUMMY"": but has double M? Position 4 is M, so if we say G U M M Y, but then position 4 is the second M? Let's count:
1: G
2: U
3: M
4: M? -> wait, but we need M at position 4, so the fourth letter must be M. In ""GUMMY"", position 3 is M and position 4 is M? Actually, G-U-M-M-Y: so position 3: M, position 4: M, position 5: Y. Actually, positions: 
1: G
2: U
3: M
4: M
5: Y

But for ""GUMMY"", if the secret word had M at position 4, then our guess ""stomp"" had M at position 4 which matched. But ""GUMMY"" has M at position 3 as well? The feedback doesn't say anything about duplicate letters. But we don't know for sure.

However, in our feedback for ""stomp"", we only have M at position 4 and P at position 5 (which was misplaced). For ""GUMMY"", M is at positions 3 and 4. So if the secret word has M only at position 4, then when we guessed ""stomp"" which has M only at position 4, it's correct.

But if the secret word had double M, like ""GUMMY"", then in ""stomp"", we guessed M at position 4 which is correct (since there is an M at position 4), and the second M? Well, we didn't guess M at other positions, so feedback would still only show the correct for position 4. Similarly, for P, in ""GUMMY"", there is no P, but our feedback from ""stomp"" said P was present. So if the secret word is ""GUMMY"", it doesn't have P, but feedback said P is present. Therefore, the word must have P.

Therefore, ""GUMMY"" doesn't have P, so it's invalid.

Back to available letters: 
Possible words: 
Think of a word with P and M at position 4.

Common words: 
""OPIUM""? 
O is absent (from stomp), so positions: O(1) absent, P(2), I(3), U(4)? M is position 4? Actually, O-P-I-U-M: position 4 is U? Then position 5: M. But we need M at position 4, not 5.

""PRIM?"" Only 4 letters.

""PRIME"": 
P(1), R(2) -> R absent? From ""crane"", R is absent. Yes, so R not allowed.

""PLUMB""?
P(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), B(5) -> yes, that looks good.

Letters: P, L, U, M, B.
Check absent letters: L, U, B are all available? 
Absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O -> none of L,U,B in there.

So ""PLUMB"" seems like a candidate.

Another one: ""GUIMP""? Not a common word.

""PLUMY""? Not standard.

Or ""BIOM?"" Not 5 letters.

Another common word: ""CLIMB""? 
C is absent? From ""crane"", C absent.

But we have ""PLUMB"" which seems valid.

Also, ""CRUMB""? C is absent.

So ""PLUMB"" is a good choice.

But let me confirm: 
We guess ""PLUMB"", meaning:
- Position 1: P -> if the word has P, and we are putting P at position 1, which must be correct if P is at position 1? We don't know. But we know P is in the word, but not at position 5. It could be at position 1.

We want to test? We might get a match.

Also, note that in ""stomp"", P was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning P is present and not at 5. So in ""PLUMB"", P is at position 1. If the word has P at position 1, we would get ✓. If P is at position 2, we would get a ""-"" for P at 1? That is, if P is at 2 or 3, then putting at 1 would give ""-"".

So with ""PLUMB"" we can quickly check.

Alternatively, another word: ""PRISM"" doesn't have M at 4.

""SPAM""? Only 4 letters.

""JUMPY"": 
J-U-M-P-Y -> positions: 
1:J, 2:U, 3:M, 4:P, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be M? So no.

""PUMMY""? Not a word.

So ""PLUMB"" looks promising.

Also, let's consider if there's a word with P at position 2 or 3.

For example, words with M at position 4 and P at position 2: 
? P ? M ? 
Like ""OPIUM"" but O absent, and structure incorrect.

Another: ""APPLE""? Has P at 1 and 2? But also A and E absent? A and E absent from crane.

Not good.

Words with P at position 3: 
? ? P M ? 
Like ""WHUMP""? Not common? ""CHUMP"" has C and H? C absent, H available? Available letters: H is allowed. But C absent? CHUMP: C at 1, absent.

""THUMP"": T is absent? Wait, T is absent from ""stomp"".

Not good.

Therefore, ""PLUMB"" seems one of the best words to guess.

Also, we can think of ""GYMP?"" Not a word.

So I will guess ""PLUMB"".

But let me list out: PLUMB is a valid English word meaning to measure depth? Also, we ensure all letters are available.

Yes.

Therefore, next guess: PLUMB.

We have tried ""crane"" and ""stomp"". Next is third guess.

So guess ""plumb"".Based on the previous feedback:
- In ""crane"", all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.
- In ""stomp"", S, T, and O are absent; M is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4; P is present but misplaced (not in position 5).

Key deductions:
- The secret word must have M in position 4.
- The secret word includes P, but not in position 5—meaning P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
- Absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O. All future guesses must avoid these.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

The goal is to test the placement of P and verify other letters. A strategic guess is ""PLUMB"":
- P is in position 1 to test if it's correctly placed there.
- L, U, M, B are all available letters and fit the constraints.
- M is in position 4 (confirming its placement).
- This word efficiently tests for P in position 1, while introducing new common letters (L, U, B) for more feedback.

<guess>plumb</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: stomp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) M(✓) P(-)
Guess 3: plumb -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(x) U(x) M(✓) B(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from the third guess ""plumb"":
- P(✓): P is correct and in the right position (position 1).
- L(x): L is not in the word.
- U(x): U is not in the word.
- M(✓): M is correct and in the right position (position 4). We already knew this.
- B(x): B is not in the word.

So now we know:
- Position 1: P (fixed)
- Position 4: M (fixed)
- The word contains P and M (with P at position 1 and M at position 4).
- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L, U, B (from previous feedbacks).

Also, from ""stomp"", we knew P is present but not at position 5, and now we know it is at position 1.

Now, the word structure is:
Position 1: P
Position 2: ? (must be a letter not in the absent list)
Position 3: ? (must be a letter not in the absent list)
Position 4: M
Position 5: ? (must be a letter not in the absent list and not P, since P is at 1 and we don't know about duplicates, but we haven't seen any duplicates so far)

We also know that the word must have exactly 5 letters, and we have two unknown positions: 2, 3, and 5.

Available letters (excluding absent ones):
Absent: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L, U, B
So available: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

But note: M and P are already in the word. We don't know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven't encountered any yet. Since we have P at position 1 and M at position 4, and the feedback for ""plumb"" showed that L, U, B are absent, we can assume that the word does not have duplicate P or M for now, unless feedback suggests otherwise.

Therefore, for positions 2, 3, and 5, we need to choose from the available letters excluding P and M? Not necessarily, because duplicates might be possible, but without evidence, it's safer to avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

But note: in the feedback for ""stomp"", we had M at position 4 correct and P at position 5 was misplaced. Now we know P is at position 1, so if the word had another P, it might have been indicated? But in ""stomp"", we only put P at position 5, and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one P, but it could be that there is only one P (at position 1) and that's why position 5 was marked as present but wrong. Similarly for M, we only have one M at position 4.

So to be safe, let's avoid duplicates for now.

Therefore, for positions 2, 3, 5, we choose from: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since M and P are already used and we avoid duplicates).

Now, we need to form a word that starts with P, has M at position 4, and uses three distinct letters from the available set for positions 2,3,5.

Common words that fit:
- P _ _ M _
Examples: 
- ""PYGMY""? But G and Y are available? Let's check: 
  P(1), Y(2), G(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but Y is repeated? And we are avoiding duplicates. Also, position 5 is Y, which is available. But ""PYGMY"" has two Y's? Actually, ""PYGMY"" is a word? It's not standard. The word is ""PYGMY"" meaning a member of certain peoples, but it has 5 letters: P-Y-G-M-Y. So positions: 1:P, 2:Y, 3:G, 4:M, 5:Y. But we have two Y's. And we are avoiding duplicates? Also, in our available letters, Y is available. But we don't know if the word has duplicate Y. However, we are trying to avoid duplicates in our guess to get more information.

But we can consider it? But let's see if there are better options.

Another word: ""PAGED""? But A is absent? From ""crane"", A is absent.

""PIGMY"" is variant of ""PYGMY"", same issue.

""PIKED""? But E is absent? From ""crane"", E absent.

""PICKY""? C is absent? From ""crane"", C absent.

""PITHY"": 
P(1), I(2), T(3) -> T is absent? From ""stomp"", T is absent. So no.

""PINKY"": N is absent? From ""crane"", N absent.

""PUDGY"": U is absent? From ""plumb"", U absent.

""PADDY"": A and D? A absent? From ""crane"", A absent.

""PADDY"" has A, which is absent.

""PODGY"": O is absent? From ""stomp"", O absent.

""PIGGY"": G and Y? But has two G's? And we are avoiding duplicates? Also, G is available.

But let's list without duplicates.

Another: ""PIXIE""? But E is absent? And it has 5 letters: P-I-X-I-E -> but E absent and I repeated? Not good.

""PIXEL"": E and L? E absent and L absent? From ""plumb"", L absent.

""PINEY"": N and E absent? From ""crane"", both absent.

""PINEY"" is not possible.

""PICKY"": C and K? C absent? From ""crane"", C absent.

""PINKY"": N absent? From ""crane"", N absent.

""PARKA"": A and R and K? A and R absent? From ""crane"", both absent.

""PARKA"" not possible.

""PARKY"": A and R absent? Same.

""PARKY"" not standard.

""PADDY"": A absent.

""PADDY"" not possible.

""PUDGY"": U absent? From ""plumb"", U absent.

""PUDGY"" not possible.

""PUGGY"": U absent? And two G's? Not good.

""PIGGY"": two G's? And G is available? But we avoid duplicates.

""PIGGY"" is a word? Meaning like a pig, but informal.

But let's think of words with P, then two letters, then M, then one letter.

Common words: 
- ""PRISM"": but R and S absent? From ""crane"" R absent, ""stomp"" S absent? So no.
- ""PRIME"": R absent? From ""crane"", R absent.
- ""PLUME"": L and E absent? From ""plumb"", L absent, and ""crane"", E absent? So no.
- ""PLUMB"": we already tried, and L and B absent.

Another: ""PHASE"": H and A and E? A and E absent? From ""crane"", both absent.

""PHONE"": H, O, E? O absent from ""stomp"", E absent from ""crane""? So no.

""PHYME""? Not a word.

""PHYLA"": H, Y, L, A? L absent? From ""plumb"", L absent, and A absent? So no.

""PHYLA"" is plural of phylum, but L and A absent.

""DIARY"": but D, I, A, R, Y? A and R absent? So no.

We need to use available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try to form words:

Possible: P, then one of [D,F,G,H,I,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z], then one of the same, then M, then one of the same.

For example:
- P, I, G, M, Y -> ""PIGMY"" (variant of pygmy) but not standard? Or ""PIGMY"" is accepted in some dictionaries? But it has 5 letters.

But we can use ""PIGMY"" if it's valid? But let's see if there's a better one.

Another: P, H, Y, M, S? But S absent? From ""stomp"", S absent.

P, H, Y, M, ? -> ""PHYMA""? Not a word.

P, I, M, M, ? -> but M at position 3? We need M at position 4, so position 3 cannot be M? Because we have M at position 4, and we are avoiding duplicates? So position 3 should not be M.

So position 3 must be a different letter.

Another: P, A, G, M, A? But A absent.

P, E, D, M, ? -> E absent.

P, I, D, M, ? -> ""PIDM?"" not a word.

P, I, K, M, ? -> ""PIKEM""? Not a word.

P, I, K, M, S -> but S absent.

P, I, K, M, Y -> ""PIKMY""? Not a word.

P, I, F, M, ? -> ""PIFM?"" not a word.

P, I, V, M, ? -> ""PIVMY""? Not a word.

P, I, G, M, Y -> ""PIGMY"" or ""PIGMY"" is sometimes written as ""pygmy"", which is 5 letters: P-Y-G-M-Y.

But in ""pygmy"", the letters are P, Y, G, M, Y. So it has two Y's? Actually, it's P-Y-G-M-Y, so positions: 1:P, 2:Y, 3:G, 4:M, 5:Y. So the letter Y is repeated.

But in our available letters, Y is available. And we don't know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in our guess, we can use duplicate letters? But we are trying to avoid to get more information? But if we use duplicate, we might not get information about other letters.

But let's see: if we guess ""PYGMY"", we are testing Y at position 2 and 5, G at 3. If the word has Y, we might get feedback on both positions.

But we have only 3 guesses left? We have used 3, so we have 3 more? Wordle has 6 guesses.

But we want to be efficient.

Another word: ""PICKY"" not possible.

""PINKY"" not possible.

""PUNKY"": U absent? From ""plumb"", U absent.

""PECKY"": E absent.

""POCKY"": O absent.

""PECKY"" not possible.

""PACKY"": A absent.

""PACKY"" not possible.

""PADDY"" not possible.

""PUDGY"" not possible.

""PODGY"" not possible.

""PIGGY"": P-I-G-G-Y. This is a word? Informal for piggy bank or something. But it has two G's.

Positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:G, 4:G, 5:Y. But we need position 4 to be M, not G. So no.

We need position 4 to be M.

So ""PIGGY"" has G at position 4, not M.

Not good.

Another idea: ""PZAZZ""? Not a word, and Z repeated.

""PFFFT""? Not a word.

Let's think of words like ""PYXIS""? But S absent? And X and I? ""PYXIS"" has S, which is absent.

""PYXIS"" not possible.

""PYINS""? S absent.

""PYINS"" not possible.

""PYGAL""? L absent? From ""plumb"", L absent.

""PYGAL"" not possible.

""PIKED"": E absent? From ""crane"", E absent.

""PIKED"" not possible.

""PIKUL""? U and L? U absent, L absent? So no.

""PIKUL"" not common.

""PILUM""? L and U? Both absent? From ""plumb"", L and U absent.

""PILUM"" not possible.

""PILAF"": L and A? Both absent? From ""plumb"" L absent, ""crane"" A absent.

""PILAF"" not possible.

""PILAW"": L and A? Same.

""PILAW"" not possible.

""PILCH""? L absent.

""PILCH"" not common.

""PILEA"": L and E and A? All absent? So no.

""PILEI"": L and E? E absent.

""PILEI"" not common.

""PILIS""? L and S? Both absent.

""PILIS"" not possible.

""PILLY"": L absent? And L is in the word? Not possible.

""PILLY"" not possible.

""PILMY"": L absent? And M at position 4? ""PILMY"" would be P-I-L-M-Y, but L is absent, so not possible.

""PILMY"" not possible.

""PIMAS"": S absent? And A absent? So no.

""PIMAS"" not possible.

""PIMPS"": S absent? And has two P's? But we have P at position 1, and if we put P at position 4? But position 4 is M, so not. ""PIMPS"" is P-I-M-P-S, so positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:M, 4:P, 5:S. But we need position 4 to be M, but in ""PIMPS"" position 4 is P, not M. So no.

We need position 4 to be M.

So words like ""P_ _M_"".

Another common word: ""PUDUM""? U absent.

""PUDUM"" not a word.

""PUDUM"" not standard.

""PUMAS"": U and S? U absent, S absent? So no.

I am considering ""PYGMY"" despite the duplicate Y. It is a valid word in English.

Another word: ""PZAZZ"" is not valid.

""PFFFT"" not valid.

""PHIZZ"" not valid.

""PJAMAS""? But A and S absent? A absent, S absent.

""PJAMAS"" not possible.

""PKdng"" not a word.

Perhaps I missed some words.

What about ""P D M"" with letters in between? Position 2 and 3 and 5.

For example, ""P D ? M ?"" but we need to fill.

""PDM"" is not a common start.

Another common word: ""PODEX""? O absent.

""PODEX"" not possible.

""PODGY"" O absent.

""PODGY"" not possible.

""POGGY""? O absent? And two G's? Not good.

""POKEY"": O and K and E and Y? O and E absent.

""POLIS"": O and L and S? All absent.

""POLIS"" not possible.

""POLJE"": O and L and J and E? All absent except J? J is available, but O, L, E absent.

""POLKA"" not possible.

""POLLY"": O and L? O and L absent.

""POLLY"" not possible.

""POLOS"": O and L and S? All absent.

""POLOS"" not possible.

""POLYP"": O and L and Y? O and L absent.

""POLYP"" not possible.

""POLYS"": O and L and S? All absent.

""POLYS"" not possible.

""POMBE"": O and E? Both absent.

""POMBE"" not common.

""POMOS"": O and S? Both absent.

""POMOS"" not common.

""POMPY"": O and P? O absent, and P is at position 1, but we are avoiding duplicate P? ""POMPY"" has P at position 4? But position 4 is M, so not.

""POMPY"" is P-O-M-P-Y, so position 4 is P, not M. So no.

We need position 4 to be M.

So back to ""PYGMY"". It is a valid word and fits the pattern.

Another word: ""GYPPO""? But G and Y and P and O? O absent, and P is at position 1, but ""GYPPO"" has P at position 4? G-Y-P-P-O, position 4 is P, not M. So no.

""GYPPO"" not possible.

""PYGMY"" seems to be the only common word that fits.

Or ""PIGMY"", same thing.

So I think we have to go with ""PYGMY"".

But let's check the available letters: P, Y, G, M, Y. M is already used, but we are using it again at position 4, which is fixed. And Y is used twice.

In terms of feedback, it will tell us about Y and G.

If we guess ""PYGMY"", and the word is something else, we might get feedback.

Another word: ""P W Y M Y""? Not a word.

""P H Y M E""? Not a word.

""P I G M Y"" is the same as ""PYGMY"".

Perhaps ""P D G M D"" not a word.

I think ""PYGMY"" is our best bet.

So let's go with that.

Guess: ""PYGMY""

But in the response format, we need to output in <guess> tags.

So <guess>pygmy</guess>

But let's double-check the feedback we might get.

If the word is ""PYGMY"", then we win.

If not, we get feedback on Y at 2, G at 3, and Y at 5.

For example, if Y is in the word, we might get a match or misplaced.

Similarly for G.

But we have to try.

Another word: ""P D G M S"" but S absent.

""P D G M D"" not a word.

""P F G M F"" not.

""P H G M H"" not.

""P I G M I"" not a word.

""P J G M J"" not.

""P K G M K"" not.

""P Q G M Q"" not.

""P V G M V"" not.

""P W G M W"" not.

""P X G M X"" not.

""P Y G M Y"" is ""PYGMY"".

""P Z G M Z"" not a word.

So I think ""PYGMY"" is the only option.

Therefore, we guess ""pygmy"".After analyzing the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. This eliminates these letters.
- **Guess 2: stomp** → S, T, O are absent; M is correct and in position 4; P is present but misplaced (not in position 5).
- **Guess 3: plumb** → P is correct and in position 1; L, U, B are absent; M is correct and in position 4 (already known).

### Key Deductions:
- **Position 1 is P** (from ""plumb"" feedback).
- **Position 4 is M** (from ""stomp"" and confirmed in ""plumb"").
- **P must be in position 1, 2, or 3** (from ""stomp"" feedback, P is present but not in position 5; now confirmed at position 1).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L, U, B (all eliminated from previous feedback).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (M and P are used but may have duplicates; however, no evidence of duplicates yet, so we avoid them for maximum information).
- **Word structure**: P _ _ M _ (positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown and must use available letters).

Given the constraints, the only common 5-letter English word that fits the pattern (P _ _ M _) and uses available letters is **PYGMY** (P-Y-G-M-Y). This guess tests:
- Y in positions 2 and 5.
- G in position 3.
- Confirms the fixed P and M positions.

If ""PYGMY"" is not the secret word, the feedback will provide critical information about Y and G, narrowing down possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>tags.

So <guess>pygmy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

But since P is misplaced at position 5, it must be in one of the first three positions? No, wait: because the positions are fixed. But note that the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5. We know:\n- Position 4: M\n\nAnd we know the word contains the letter P, but it\'s not at position 5. Also, because we got a ""-"" for P at position 5, P must be present somewhere else (either position 1,2,3). However, note that it could potentially be in the other positions except 4 (which is M) and 5 (since it was misplaced). But we don\'t know positions 1,2,3,5 yet.\n\nBut also, from ""crane"" we know C,R,A,N,E are absent.\n\nNow, in ""stomp"", we also learned S,T,O are absent.\n\nSo absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O.\n\nPresent letters we know: M and P (and M is fixed at position 4, and P is somewhere not at 5).\n\nTherefore, the word must contain P and M, and three other letters that are not among the absent ones.\n\nNow, we need to form a word of 5 letters that has M at position 4 and P in one of positions 1,2,3 (since not 4 or 5). But wait, it could be at position 5? But in the feedback for ""stomp"", P was at position 5 and got ""-"", which means P is in the word but not at that position. Therefore, P is NOT at position 5. Therefore, P must be in position 1,2, or 3.\n\nAlso, the word must have an M at position 4.\n\nSo our word structure: \n- Position 1: unknown, but must be a letter not in {C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O}, and it could be P? yes\n- Position 2: unknown, not in the absent set, could be P? yes\n- Position 3: unknown, not in the absent set, could be P? yes\n- Position 4: M (fixed)\n- Position 5: unknown, but not any of the absent letters and cannot be P (since P isn\'t at 5). Also, because we know P is in the word, position 5 is a different letter.\n\nNow, what letters are available? The alphabet excluding absent: \nAbsent: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O.\n\nSo available letters: \nB, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note M and P are already used, but they can appear in the word multiple times? Feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicates. We don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in ""stomp"" we only have one P and one M. The feedback for M was ✓ and for P was -, so M was correctly placed and P is present elsewhere. So duplicate letters: if the word has two Ps, it\'s possible? But our feedback only shows that there is at least one P, and it wasn\'t at position 5.\n\nSo, we need to think of a word that has M at position 4 and at least one P in positions 1,2, or 3.\n\nFurthermore, we need a word that uses only the available letters.\n\nLet me brainstorm words that have M as the fourth letter and P somewhere in front:\n\nFor example:\n- Letter patterns: _ _ _ M _\nWe need P to be in one of the first three.\n\nPossible words:\n\nConsider common words:\n\n- PLUM? But has L,U. U is available? Let\'s see: available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z. Yes, U is available.\n\nPLUM: if we think PLUM, but the positions: \nPosition 1: P\nPosition 2: L\nPosition 3: U\nPosition 4: M -> fixed\nPosition 5: ? But PLUM only has 4 letters? PLUMM? Not valid. The word is 5 letters. So PLUM is 4 letters. Not valid.\n\n5-letter words with M at 4:\n\nI recall words like ""GRIME"", ""PRIME"", ""TRUMP"", etc., but note TRUMP contains R,T which are absent (from ""crane"" we have R and T absent). T is absent from ""stomp"" and ""crane"", R is absent from ""crane"".\n\nTRUMP: position 4 is M? \nT R U M P -> position 4 is M? \nPosition 1:T (absent, from stomp -> T is absent), position 2:R (absent from crane), position 4:M, position 5:P.\n\nBut T and R are absent, so no.\n\nSimilarly, let\'s look for words ending in ""M"". Actually, we are looking for words with M at position 4.\n\nExamples of words with fourth letter M and containing P:\n\n- ""GRUMP"": \n  G (1), R (2) -> R is absent (from crane), so no.\n- ""CLAMP"": \n  C (1) -> absent (crane), L (2), A (3) -> absent (crane). Not good.\n- ""PROM?"" But PROM is 4 letters? \nWhat about: ""PRISM""?\nPRISM: positions: P(1), R(2), I(3), S(4), M(5) -> but our M is at position 4, not 5. So no.\n\nWe need M at position 4.\n\nAnother one: ""CRAMP"" -> C and R absent.\n\n""TEMPO"": but T and O absent.\n\nLet\'s try words that have P in the beginning and M at the end? Position 4 is the third letter? Wait, indices: position 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nSo position 4 is M.\n\nSo words like: ...M.\n\nCommon patterns: \n- Words ending with ""M"": so the fifth letter would be ...? But position 4 is M, then position 5 is something.\n\nFor example: ""DOGMA"" -> positions: D(1), O(2) -> absent? O is absent (from stomp), G(3), M(4), A(5) -> A absent.\n\nNot suitable.\n\n""GUMMY"": but has double M? Position 4 is M, so if we say G U M M Y, but then position 4 is the second M? Let\'s count:\n1: G\n2: U\n3: M\n4: M? -> wait, but we need M at position 4, so the fourth letter must be M. In ""GUMMY"", position 3 is M and position 4 is M? Actually, G-U-M-M-Y: so position 3: M, position 4: M, position 5: Y. Actually, positions: \n1: G\n2: U\n3: M\n4: M\n5: Y\n\nBut for ""GUMMY"", if the secret word had M at position 4, then our guess ""stomp"" had M at position 4 which matched. But ""GUMMY"" has M at position 3 as well? The feedback doesn\'t say anything about duplicate letters. But we don\'t know for sure.\n\nHowever, in our feedback for ""stomp"", we only have M at position 4 and P at position 5 (which was misplaced). For ""GUMMY"", M is at positions 3 and 4. So if the secret word has M only at position 4, then when we guessed ""stomp"" which has M only at position 4, it\'s correct.\n\nBut if the secret word had double M, like ""GUMMY"", then in ""stomp"", we guessed M at position 4 which is correct (since there is an M at position 4), and the second M? Well, we didn\'t guess M at other positions, so feedback would still only show the correct for position 4. Similarly, for P, in ""GUMMY"", there is no P, but our feedback from ""stomp"" said P was present. So if the secret word is ""GUMMY"", it doesn\'t have P, but feedback said P is present. Therefore, the word must have P.\n\nTherefore, ""GUMMY"" doesn\'t have P, so it\'s invalid.\n\nBack to available letters: \nPossible words: \nThink of a word with P and M at position 4.\n\nCommon words: \n""OPIUM""? \nO is absent (from stomp), so positions: O(1) absent, P(2), I(3), U(4)? M is position 4? Actually, O-P-I-U-M: position 4 is U? Then position 5: M. But we need M at position 4, not 5.\n\n""PRIM?"" Only 4 letters.\n\n""PRIME"": \nP(1), R(2) -> R absent? From ""crane"", R is absent. Yes, so R not allowed.\n\n""PLUMB""?\nP(1), L(2), U(3), M(4), B(5) -> yes, that looks good.\n\nLetters: P, L, U, M, B.\nCheck absent letters: L, U, B are all available? \nAbsent: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O -> none of L,U,B in there.\n\nSo ""PLUMB"" seems like a candidate.\n\nAnother one: ""GUIMP""? Not a common word.\n\n""PLUMY""? Not standard.\n\nOr ""BIOM?"" Not 5 letters.\n\nAnother common word: ""CLIMB""? \nC is absent? From ""crane"", C absent.\n\nBut we have ""PLUMB"" which seems valid.\n\nAlso, ""CRUMB""? C is absent.\n\nSo ""PLUMB"" is a good choice.\n\nBut let me confirm: \nWe guess ""PLUMB"", meaning:\n- Position 1: P -> if the word has P, and we are putting P at position 1, which must be correct if P is at position 1? We don\'t know. But we know P is in the word, but not at position 5. It could be at position 1.\n\nWe want to test? We might get a match.\n\nAlso, note that in ""stomp"", P was at position 5 and got ""-"", meaning P is present and not at 5. So in ""PLUMB"", P is at position 1. If the word has P at position 1, we would get ✓. If P is at position 2, we would get a ""-"" for P at 1? That is, if P is at 2 or 3, then putting at 1 would give ""-"".\n\nSo with ""PLUMB"" we can quickly check.\n\nAlternatively, another word: ""PRISM"" doesn\'t have M at 4.\n\n""SPAM""? Only 4 letters.\n\n""JUMPY"": \nJ-U-M-P-Y -> positions: \n1:J, 2:U, 3:M, 4:P, 5:Y -> but we need position 4 to be M? So no.\n\n""PUMMY""? Not a word.\n\nSo ""PLUMB"" looks promising.\n\nAlso, let\'s consider if there\'s a word with P at position 2 or 3.\n\nFor example, words with M at position 4 and P at position 2: \n? P ? M ? \nLike ""OPIUM"" but O absent, and structure incorrect.\n\nAnother: ""APPLE""? Has P at 1 and 2? But also A and E absent? A and E absent from crane.\n\nNot good.\n\nWords with P at position 3: \n? ? P M ? \nLike ""WHUMP""? Not common? ""CHUMP"" has C and H? C absent, H available? Available letters: H is allowed. But C absent? CHUMP: C at 1, absent.\n\n""THUMP"": T is absent? Wait, T is absent from ""stomp"".\n\nNot good.\n\nTherefore, ""PLUMB"" seems one of the best words to guess.\n\nAlso, we can think of ""GYMP?"" Not a word.\n\nSo I will guess ""PLUMB"".\n\nBut let me list out: PLUMB is a valid English word meaning to measure depth? Also, we ensure all letters are available.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, next guess: PLUMB.\n\nWe have tried ""crane"" and ""stomp"". Next is third guess.\n\nSo guess ""plumb"".Based on the previous feedback:\n- In ""crane"", all letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent from the secret word.\n- In ""stomp"", S, T, and O are absent; M is in the secret word and correctly placed in position 4; P is present but misplaced (not in position 5).\n\nKey deductions:\n- The secret word must have M in position 4.\n- The secret word includes P, but not in position 5—meaning P must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- Absent letters so far: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O. All future guesses must avoid these.\n- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nThe goal is to test the placement of P and verify other letters. A strategic guess is ""PLUMB"":\n- P is in position 1 to test if it\'s correctly placed there.\n- L, U, M, B are all available letters and fit the constraints.\n- M is in position 4 (confirming its placement).\n- This word efficiently tests for P in position 1, while introducing new common letters (L, U, B) for more feedback.\n\n<guess>plumb</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: stomp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) M(✓) P(-)\nGuess 3: plumb -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(x) U(x) M(✓) B(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from the third guess ""plumb"":\n- P(✓): P is correct and in the right position (position 1).\n- L(x): L is not in the word.\n- U(x): U is not in the word.\n- M(✓): M is correct and in the right position (position 4). We already knew this.\n- B(x): B is not in the word.\n\nSo now we know:\n- Position 1: P (fixed)\n- Position 4: M (fixed)\n- The word contains P and M (with P at position 1 and M at position 4).\n- Absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L, U, B (from previous feedbacks).\n\nAlso, from ""stomp"", we knew P is present but not at position 5, and now we know it is at position 1.\n\nNow, the word structure is:\nPosition 1: P\nPosition 2: ? (must be a letter not in the absent list)\nPosition 3: ? (must be a letter not in the absent list)\nPosition 4: M\nPosition 5: ? (must be a letter not in the absent list and not P, since P is at 1 and we don\'t know about duplicates, but we haven\'t seen any duplicates so far)\n\nWe also know that the word must have exactly 5 letters, and we have two unknown positions: 2, 3, and 5.\n\nAvailable letters (excluding absent ones):\nAbsent: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L, U, B\nSo available: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nBut note: M and P are already in the word. We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed, but we haven\'t encountered any yet. Since we have P at position 1 and M at position 4, and the feedback for ""plumb"" showed that L, U, B are absent, we can assume that the word does not have duplicate P or M for now, unless feedback suggests otherwise.\n\nTherefore, for positions 2, 3, and 5, we need to choose from the available letters excluding P and M? Not necessarily, because duplicates might be possible, but without evidence, it\'s safer to avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\nBut note: in the feedback for ""stomp"", we had M at position 4 correct and P at position 5 was misplaced. Now we know P is at position 1, so if the word had another P, it might have been indicated? But in ""stomp"", we only put P at position 5, and it was marked as present but wrong position. That means there is at least one P, but it could be that there is only one P (at position 1) and that\'s why position 5 was marked as present but wrong. Similarly for M, we only have one M at position 4.\n\nSo to be safe, let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\nTherefore, for positions 2, 3, 5, we choose from: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (since M and P are already used and we avoid duplicates).\n\nNow, we need to form a word that starts with P, has M at position 4, and uses three distinct letters from the available set for positions 2,3,5.\n\nCommon words that fit:\n- P _ _ M _\nExamples: \n- ""PYGMY""? But G and Y are available? Let\'s check: \n  P(1), Y(2), G(3), M(4), Y(5) -> but Y is repeated? And we are avoiding duplicates. Also, position 5 is Y, which is available. But ""PYGMY"" has two Y\'s? Actually, ""PYGMY"" is a word? It\'s not standard. The word is ""PYGMY"" meaning a member of certain peoples, but it has 5 letters: P-Y-G-M-Y. So positions: 1:P, 2:Y, 3:G, 4:M, 5:Y. But we have two Y\'s. And we are avoiding duplicates? Also, in our available letters, Y is available. But we don\'t know if the word has duplicate Y. However, we are trying to avoid duplicates in our guess to get more information.\n\nBut we can consider it? But let\'s see if there are better options.\n\nAnother word: ""PAGED""? But A is absent? From ""crane"", A is absent.\n\n""PIGMY"" is variant of ""PYGMY"", same issue.\n\n""PIKED""? But E is absent? From ""crane"", E absent.\n\n""PICKY""? C is absent? From ""crane"", C absent.\n\n""PITHY"": \nP(1), I(2), T(3) -> T is absent? From ""stomp"", T is absent. So no.\n\n""PINKY"": N is absent? From ""crane"", N absent.\n\n""PUDGY"": U is absent? From ""plumb"", U absent.\n\n""PADDY"": A and D? A absent? From ""crane"", A absent.\n\n""PADDY"" has A, which is absent.\n\n""PODGY"": O is absent? From ""stomp"", O absent.\n\n""PIGGY"": G and Y? But has two G\'s? And we are avoiding duplicates? Also, G is available.\n\nBut let\'s list without duplicates.\n\nAnother: ""PIXIE""? But E is absent? And it has 5 letters: P-I-X-I-E -> but E absent and I repeated? Not good.\n\n""PIXEL"": E and L? E absent and L absent? From ""plumb"", L absent.\n\n""PINEY"": N and E absent? From ""crane"", both absent.\n\n""PINEY"" is not possible.\n\n""PICKY"": C and K? C absent? From ""crane"", C absent.\n\n""PINKY"": N absent? From ""crane"", N absent.\n\n""PARKA"": A and R and K? A and R absent? From ""crane"", both absent.\n\n""PARKA"" not possible.\n\n""PARKY"": A and R absent? Same.\n\n""PARKY"" not standard.\n\n""PADDY"": A absent.\n\n""PADDY"" not possible.\n\n""PUDGY"": U absent? From ""plumb"", U absent.\n\n""PUDGY"" not possible.\n\n""PUGGY"": U absent? And two G\'s? Not good.\n\n""PIGGY"": two G\'s? And G is available? But we avoid duplicates.\n\n""PIGGY"" is a word? Meaning like a pig, but informal.\n\nBut let\'s think of words with P, then two letters, then M, then one letter.\n\nCommon words: \n- ""PRISM"": but R and S absent? From ""crane"" R absent, ""stomp"" S absent? So no.\n- ""PRIME"": R absent? From ""crane"", R absent.\n- ""PLUME"": L and E absent? From ""plumb"", L absent, and ""crane"", E absent? So no.\n- ""PLUMB"": we already tried, and L and B absent.\n\nAnother: ""PHASE"": H and A and E? A and E absent? From ""crane"", both absent.\n\n""PHONE"": H, O, E? O absent from ""stomp"", E absent from ""crane""? So no.\n\n""PHYME""? Not a word.\n\n""PHYLA"": H, Y, L, A? L absent? From ""plumb"", L absent, and A absent? So no.\n\n""PHYLA"" is plural of phylum, but L and A absent.\n\n""DIARY"": but D, I, A, R, Y? A and R absent? So no.\n\nWe need to use available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nLet\'s try to form words:\n\nPossible: P, then one of [D,F,G,H,I,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z], then one of the same, then M, then one of the same.\n\nFor example:\n- P, I, G, M, Y -> ""PIGMY"" (variant of pygmy) but not standard? Or ""PIGMY"" is accepted in some dictionaries? But it has 5 letters.\n\nBut we can use ""PIGMY"" if it\'s valid? But let\'s see if there\'s a better one.\n\nAnother: P, H, Y, M, S? But S absent? From ""stomp"", S absent.\n\nP, H, Y, M, ? -> ""PHYMA""? Not a word.\n\nP, I, M, M, ? -> but M at position 3? We need M at position 4, so position 3 cannot be M? Because we have M at position 4, and we are avoiding duplicates? So position 3 should not be M.\n\nSo position 3 must be a different letter.\n\nAnother: P, A, G, M, A? But A absent.\n\nP, E, D, M, ? -> E absent.\n\nP, I, D, M, ? -> ""PIDM?"" not a word.\n\nP, I, K, M, ? -> ""PIKEM""? Not a word.\n\nP, I, K, M, S -> but S absent.\n\nP, I, K, M, Y -> ""PIKMY""? Not a word.\n\nP, I, F, M, ? -> ""PIFM?"" not a word.\n\nP, I, V, M, ? -> ""PIVMY""? Not a word.\n\nP, I, G, M, Y -> ""PIGMY"" or ""PIGMY"" is sometimes written as ""pygmy"", which is 5 letters: P-Y-G-M-Y.\n\nBut in ""pygmy"", the letters are P, Y, G, M, Y. So it has two Y\'s? Actually, it\'s P-Y-G-M-Y, so positions: 1:P, 2:Y, 3:G, 4:M, 5:Y. So the letter Y is repeated.\n\nBut in our available letters, Y is available. And we don\'t know if the word has duplicate letters. However, in our guess, we can use duplicate letters? But we are trying to avoid to get more information? But if we use duplicate, we might not get information about other letters.\n\nBut let\'s see: if we guess ""PYGMY"", we are testing Y at position 2 and 5, G at 3. If the word has Y, we might get feedback on both positions.\n\nBut we have only 3 guesses left? We have used 3, so we have 3 more? Wordle has 6 guesses.\n\nBut we want to be efficient.\n\nAnother word: ""PICKY"" not possible.\n\n""PINKY"" not possible.\n\n""PUNKY"": U absent? From ""plumb"", U absent.\n\n""PECKY"": E absent.\n\n""POCKY"": O absent.\n\n""PECKY"" not possible.\n\n""PACKY"": A absent.\n\n""PACKY"" not possible.\n\n""PADDY"" not possible.\n\n""PUDGY"" not possible.\n\n""PODGY"" not possible.\n\n""PIGGY"": P-I-G-G-Y. This is a word? Informal for piggy bank or something. But it has two G\'s.\n\nPositions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:G, 4:G, 5:Y. But we need position 4 to be M, not G. So no.\n\nWe need position 4 to be M.\n\nSo ""PIGGY"" has G at position 4, not M.\n\nNot good.\n\nAnother idea: ""PZAZZ""? Not a word, and Z repeated.\n\n""PFFFT""? Not a word.\n\nLet\'s think of words like ""PYXIS""? But S absent? And X and I? ""PYXIS"" has S, which is absent.\n\n""PYXIS"" not possible.\n\n""PYINS""? S absent.\n\n""PYINS"" not possible.\n\n""PYGAL""? L absent? From ""plumb"", L absent.\n\n""PYGAL"" not possible.\n\n""PHYLA"" not possible.\n\n""PHYLE""? E absent.\n\n""PHYLE"" not possible.\n\n""PHLOX""? L and O? L absent, O absent? So no.\n\n""PHLOX"" not possible.\n\n""PHIZZ""? Not a word.\n\n""PHIZZ"" not standard.\n\n""PIXIE"": E absent?

Not possible.\n\n""PILLY"" not possible.\n\n""PILMY"": L absent? And M at position 4? ""PILMY"" would be P-I-L-M-Y, but L is absent, so not possible.\n\n""PILMY"" not possible.\n\n""PIMAS"": S absent? And A absent? So no.\n\n""PIMAS"" not possible.\n\n""PIMPS"": S absent? And has two P\'s? But we have P at position 1, and if we put P at position 4? But position 4 is M, so not. ""PIMPS"" is P-I-M-P-S, so positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:M, 4:P, 5:S. But we need position 4 to be M, but in ""PIMPS"" position 4 is P, not M. So no.\n\nWe need position 4 to be M.\n\nSo words like ""P_ _M_"".\n\nAnother common word: ""PUDUM""? U absent.\n\n""PUDUM"" not a word.\n\n""PUDUM"" not standard.\n\n""PUMAS"": U and S? U absent, S absent? So no.\n\n""PUMAS"" not possible.\n\n""PUMIE""? U and E?

We are in the middle of a Wordle game. The previous feedback is:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)  [all letters absent]
Guess 2: stomp -> FEEDBACK: S(x) T(x) O(x) M(✓) P(-)  [M is correct and in position 4; P is present but in the wrong position (not at 5)]
Guess 3: plumb -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) L(x) U(x) M(✓) B(x)  [P is correct at position 1; M is correct at position 4; L, U, B absent]

We then attempted to guess ""pygmy"", but the system says: ""Model answer is not five letters."" This is an error because ""pygmy"" is a valid 5-letter word. However, perhaps the system is case-sensitive or has a specific dictionary. Let me check: ""pygmy"" is indeed 5 letters: P-Y-G-M-Y.

But the feedback says: ""Model answer is not five letters."" This might be a mistake in the simulation. Alternatively, perhaps the system expects uppercase? But in previous guesses we used lowercase.

Looking back at the history:
- Guess 1: crane (lowercase)
- Guess 2: stomp (lowercase)
- Guess 3: plumb (lowercase)
- Then we said: <guess>pygmy</guess> but the system responded with ""Model answer is not five letters.""

This is confusing. Perhaps the system is referring to the secret word? But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe there was a formatting issue.

But the instruction says: ""return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>""

We did that for ""pygmy"". However, the system's response is: ""Make a new 5-letter word guess. Here is some previous feedback: ... Guess 4: tags. So <guess>pygmy -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.""

This seems like an error. But to proceed, we must make a new guess.

Alternatively, perhaps ""pygmy"" is not in the word list? But it is a valid word. However, to avoid this issue, let's choose a different word that fits the criteria.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Starts with P (position 1)
- Has M at position 4
- Uses only available letters (excluding absent: C,R,A,N,E,S,T,O,L,U,B)
- And avoids duplicates for now (since we have no evidence of duplicates)

Available letters: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5.

We tried ""pygmy"" but it was rejected. So let's try to find another word.

Possible words:

- ""PIGMY"" (variant of pygmy) - same as pygmy, might be rejected too.
- ""PZAZZ"" - not a word.
- ""PFFFT"" - not a word.

Another idea: ""PHYMY""? Not a word.

""PIGMY"" is the same as ""PYGMY"".

Perhaps ""PYXMY"" not a word.

What about ""P D H M Y""? Not a word.

""P H Y M S"" - S is absent.

""P I G M Y"" is the same.

Another word: ""P D G M S"" - S absent.

""P F G M F"" not a word.

""P H G M H"" not.

""P I G M I"" not.

""P J G M J"" not.

""P K G M K"" not.

""P Q G M Q"" not.

""P V G M V"" not.

""P W G M W"" not.

""P X G M X"" not.

""P Y G M Y"" is the only one we have.

Perhaps we can use a word with duplicate M? But position 4 is M, and we don't know if there is another M. But we have no evidence.

For example, ""P I M M Y"" -> ""PIMMY"" not a word.

""P A M M Y"" -> A absent.

""P E M M Y"" -> E absent.

""P U M M Y"" -> U absent.

""P O M M Y"" -> O absent.

""P Y M M Y"" -> ""PYMMY"" not a word.

Another common word: ""P R I M O"" -> R and O absent.

Not possible.

""P R A M S"" -> R, A, S absent.

No.

Perhaps ""P D I M E"" -> E absent.

No.

""P D I M Y"" -> ""PDIMY"" not a word.

""P H I M S"" -> S absent.

""P H I M Y"" -> ""PHIMY"" not a word.

""P K I M S"" -> S absent.

""P K I M Y"" -> ""PKIMY"" not a word.

""P Y I M S"" -> S absent.

""P Y I M Y"" -> ""PYIMY"" not a word.

""P Y K M Y"" -> ""PYKMY"" not a word.

""P Y V M Y"" -> ""PYVMY"" not a word.

""P Y Z M Y"" -> ""PYZMY"" not a word.

This is difficult. Maybe we need to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we have no indication.

Another idea: perhaps the letter in position 5 is the same as position 2 or 3, but we don't know.

But we need a valid word.

Let's list all possible words from the dictionary that fit P _ _ M _ and use only available letters.

Available letters for positions 2,3,5: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Common words that fit:
- ""PYGMY"" (rejected, but it should be valid)
- ""PUDUM"" (not a word)
- ""POMUM"" (not a word)

Perhaps ""PALMY"" -> but A and L absent.

Not possible.

""PODGY"" -> O absent.

""PUDGY"" -> U absent.

""PENNY"" -> E and N absent.

""PINNY"" -> N absent.

""PUNNY"" -> U and N absent.

""FUNKY"" -> F is available, but we start with P.

We start with P.

Another word: ""P D M"" not followed.

Perhaps ""P A D M E"" -> A, E absent.

No.

I recall the word ""PYGMY"" is valid. But since it was rejected, maybe the system has a different word list.

Perhaps we can try ""PIGGY"" but that has G at position 4, not M.

Not.

""P DIM M"" not.

Let's think of ""P I G M E"" -> E absent.

No.

""P I G M A"" -> A absent.

No.

""P I G M P"" -> duplicate P, and position 4 is M, position 5 is P. But in ""stomp"", P was misplaced at position 5, so P cannot be at position 5. So position 5 cannot be P.

So we cannot have P at position 5.

Similarly, M at position 4, so position 5 cannot be M either? We don't know, but we are avoiding duplicates.

But in ""stomp"", P at 5 was misplaced, so P is not at 5, but it could be at 1,2,3. Now we know it's at 1.

For M, we have no information about other positions.

But let's assume no duplicate M for now.

So position 5 cannot be P or M.

Available letters for position 5: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Similarly for 2 and 3.

Another word: ""P Y K M S"" -> S absent.

No.

""P Y H M S"" -> S absent.

No.

""P Y D M S"" -> S absent.

No.

""P Y D M Y"" -> ""PYDMY"" not a word.

""P Y G M Y"" is the only one.

Perhaps ""P H Y M E"" -> E absent.

No.

""P H Y M P"" -> duplicate P, and position 5 cannot be P.

Not allowed.

""P I Y M P"" -> same.

Not.

I think we have to try a different approach. Maybe the secret word has a duplicate letter, but we haven't guessed it yet.

For example, perhaps the word has two M's? But then in ""stomp"" and ""plumb"", we only have one M, and it was correct at position 4. If there was another M, it might not have been revealed because we didn't guess it. But in ""stomp"", we guessed M only at position 4, so if there is another M, it wouldn't show. Similarly in ""plumb"", M only at position 4.

So it's possible.

For example, a word like ""P U M M Y"" -> U absent.

""P A M M Y"" -> A absent.

""P O M M Y"" -> O absent.

""P I M M Y"" -> ""PIMMY"" not a word.

""P E M M Y"" -> E absent.

""P Y M M Y"" -> ""PYMMY"" not a word.

""P L M M Y"" -> L absent.

""P B M M Y"" -> B absent.

""P G M M Y"" -> ""PGMMY"" not a word.

""P D M M Y"" -> ""PDMMY"" not a word.

""P F M M Y"" -> not.

""P H M M Y"" -> ""PHMMY"" not a word.

""P J M M Y"" -> not.

""P K M M Y"" -> not.

""P Q M M Y"" -> not.

""P V M M Y"" -> not.

""P W M M Y"" -> not.

""P X M M Y"" -> not.

""P Z M M Y"" -> not.

So no.

Perhaps the word has a different letter at position 3.

Another idea: ""P R E M S"" -> R,E,S absent.

No.

""P D E M O"" -> D,E,O absent.

No.

""P I E M S"" -> E,S absent.

No.

""P I V M S"" -> S absent.

No.

""P I V M Y"" -> ""PIVMY"" not a word.

""P I W M Y"" -> ""PIWMY"" not a word.

""P I X M Y"" -> ""PIXMY"" not a word.

""P I Z M Y"" -> ""PIZMY"" not a word.

""P Y W M Y"" -> ""PYWMY"" not a word.

""P Y X M Y"" -> ""PYXMY"" not a word.

I think we have to use ""PYGMY"" again or accept that it might be the only possibility.

Perhaps the system made a mistake, and we should try a different word that is 5 letters.

Another common word: ""P D G M S"" not.

""P H G M S"" not.

""P H G M D"" -> ""PHGMD"" not a word.

""P D G M D"" not.

""P F G M D"" not.

Perhaps ""P D I M S"" not.

Let's search for words ending with ""MY"" and starting with ""P"", with 5 letters, and M at position 4.

So pattern: P ? ? M Y

Then position 2 and 3 are unknown.

Available letters for position 2 and 3: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z (Y is at position 5, so for position 2 and 3, we can use other letters, including G, etc.)

For example:
- P, G, G, M, Y -> ""PGGMY"" not a word.
- P, H, H, M, Y -> ""PHHMY"" not.
- P, I, I, M, Y -> ""PIIMY"" not.
- P, D, D, M, Y -> ""PDDMY"" not.
- P, F, F, M, Y -> ""PFFMY"" not.
- P, K, K, M, Y -> ""PKKMY"" not.
- P, V, V, M, Y -> ""PVVMY"" not.
- P, W, W, M, Y -> ""PWWMY"" not.
- P, X, X, M, Y -> ""PXXMY"" not.
- P, Z, Z, M, Y -> ""PZZMY"" not.

Or mixed:
- P, D, G, M, Y -> ""PDGMY"" not a word.
- P, G, D, M, Y -> ""PGDMY"" not.
- P, H, G, M, Y -> ""PHGMY"" not.
- P, G, H, M, Y -> ""PGHMY"" not.
- P, I, G, M, Y -> ""PIGMY"" which is the same as ""PYGMY"", just different order? ""PIGMY"" would be P-I-G-M-Y, which is different from P-Y-G-M-Y.

""PIGMY"" is a variant spelling of ""pygmy"", but it might be accepted.

Let's try ""PIGMY"".

So guess: ""PIGMY""

But it's essentially the same as ""PYGMY"", just with I and Y swapped.

In ""PIGMY"", positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:G, 4:M, 5:Y.

This uses available letters: I, G, Y are available.

And no duplicates.

So this should be valid.

Perhaps the system will accept it.

So let's guess ""pigmy"".

<guess>pigmy</guess>

But in the previous, we had ""pygmy"" which was rejected, so ""pigmy"" might be too.

Perhaps it's not in the word list.

Another word: ""P D A M N"" -> A and N absent.

No.

""P D E M P"" -> E absent and duplicate P.

No.

I think we have to go with ""pigmy"".

Or perhaps ""PYXIS"" but S absent.

No.

""PYGAL"" L absent.

No.

""PHYLA"" L and A absent.

No.

""PHYLE"" E absent.

No.

""P D G M P"" -> duplicate P and position 5 cannot be P.

No.

""P F G M P"" same.

No.

""P Y G M P"" -> position 5 cannot be P.

No.

So I think ""pigmy"" is worth a try.

If not, we might need to consider that the secret word has a letter we haven't tried.

Perhaps we missed a word.

Another possibility: ""P D M P H"" not a word.

""P H M P D"" not.

""P I M P S"" -> S absent.

No.

""P I M P Y"" -> ""PIMPY"" is a word? Meaning resembling a pimp. But position 4 is M, and in ""PIMPY"", position 3 is M? P-I-M-P-Y, so position 3 is M, position 4 is P. But we need position 4 to be M, so not.

Not good.

""P Y M P Y"" -> ""PYMPY"" not a word.

I think we must use ""pigmy"".

So let's guess that.
</think>
After reviewing the feedback and the rejection of ""pygmy"" as an invalid word (despite it being a valid English word), I need to select a different 5-letter word that fits the constraints. The feedback from previous guesses is:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent.
- **Guess 2: stomp** → S, T, O are absent; M is correct and in position 4; P is present but misplaced (not in position 5).
- **Guess 3: plumb** → P is correct and in position 1; L, U, B are absent; M is correct and in position 4 (confirmed).

### Key Deductions:
- **Position 1 is P** (from ""plumb"" feedback).
- **Position 4 is M** (from ""stomp"" and confirmed in ""plumb"").
- **P must be in position 1, 2, or 3** (from ""stomp"" feedback, P is present but not in position 5; now confirmed at position 1).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L, U, B (all eliminated from previous feedback).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (M and P are used, but no duplicates indicated yet, so we avoid them for maximum information).
- **Word structure**: P _ _ M _ (positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown and must use available letters).

Since ""pygmy"" was rejected, I need an alternative word that fits the pattern and uses only available letters. After exploring options, the word **PIGMY** (a variant spelling of ""pygmy"") is a valid 5-letter word that meets the criteria:
- P (position 1), I (position 2), G (position 3), M (position 4), Y (position 5).
- All letters are from the available set (I, G, Y are available and not duplicates of P or M).
- This guess tests new letters (I, G, Y) and confirms the fixed P and M positions.

If ""PIGMY"" is not the secret word, the feedback will provide information on I, G, and Y, helping to narrow down the possibilities for the next guess.

<guess>pigmy</guess>",pygmy,"We are in the middle of a Wordle game. The previous feedback is:

We then attempted to guess ""pygmy"", but the system says: ""Model answer is not five letters."" This is an error because ""pygmy"" is a valid 5-letter word. However, perhaps the system is case-sensitive or has a specific dictionary. Let me check: ""pygmy"" is indeed 5 letters: P-Y-G-M-Y.

This is difficult. Maybe we need to consider that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we have no indication.

Another idea: perhaps the letter in position 5 is the same as position 2 or 3, but we don't know.

But we need a valid word.

Let's list all possible words from the dictionary that fit P _ _ M _ and use only available letters.

Perhaps we can try ""PIGGY"" but that has G at position 4, not M.

Not.

""P DIM M"" not.

Let's think of ""P I G M E"" -> E absent.

No.

""P I G M A"" -> A absent.

No.

""P I G M P"" -> duplicate P, and position 4 is M, position 5 is P. But in ""stomp"", P was misplaced at position 5, so P cannot be at position 5. So position 5 cannot be P.

So we cannot have P at position 5.

Similarly, M at position 4, so position 5 cannot be M either? We don't know, but we are avoiding duplicates.

But in ""stomp"", P at 5 was misplaced, so P is not at 5, but it could be at 1,2,3. Now we know it's at 1.

For M, we have no information about other positions.

But let's assume no duplicate M for now.

So position 5 cannot be P or M.

Available letters for position 5: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Y,Z

Similarly for 2 and 3.

Another word: ""P Y K M S"" -> S absent.

No.

""P Y H M S"" -> S absent.

No.

""P Y D M S"" -> S absent.

No.

""P Y D M Y"" -> ""PYDMY"" not a word.

Perhaps ""P H Y M E"" -> E absent.

No.

""P H Y M P"" -> duplicate P, and position 5 cannot be P.

Not allowed.

Not.

I think we have to try a different approach. Maybe the secret word has a duplicate letter, but we haven't guessed it yet.

For example, perhaps the word has two M's? But then in ""stomp"" and ""plumb"", we only have one M, and it was correct at position 4. If there was another M, it might not have been revealed because we didn't guess it. But in ""stomp"", we guessed M only at position 4, so if there is another M, it wouldn't show.

""P Q M M Y"" -> not.

""P V M M Y"" -> not.

""P W M M Y"" -> not.

""P X M M Y"" -> not.

""P Z M M Y"" -> not.

So no.

Perhaps the word has a different letter at position 3.

Another idea: ""P R E M S"" -> R,E,S absent.

No.

""P D E M O"" -> D,E,O absent.

No.

""P I E M S"" -> E,S absent.

No.

""P I V M S"" -> S absent.

No.

""P I V M Y"" -> ""PIVMY"" not a word.

""P I W M Y"" -> ""PIWMY"" not a word.

""P I X M Y"" -> ""PIXMY"" not a word.

""P I Z M Y"" -> ""PIZMY"" not a word.

""P Y W M Y"" -> ""PYWMY"" not a word.

""P Y X M Y"" -> ""PYXMY"" not a word.

I think we have to use ""PYGMY"" again or accept that it might be the only possibility.

Perhaps the system made a mistake, and we should try a different word that is 5 letters.

Another common word: ""P D G M S"" not.

""P H G M S"" not.

""P H G M D"" -> ""PHGMD"" not a word.

""P D G M D"" not.

""P F G M D"" not.

Perhaps ""P D I M S"" not.

Let's search for words ending with ""MY"" and starting with ""P"", with 5 letters, and M at position 4.

So pattern: P ? ? M Y

Then position 2 and 3 are unknown.

Available letters for position 2 and 3: D,F,G,H,I,J,K,Q,V,W,X,Z (Y is at position 5, so for position 2 and 3, we can use other letters, including G, etc.)

For example:
- P, G, G, M, Y -> ""PGGMY"" not a word.
- P, H, H, M, Y -> ""PHHMY"" not.
- P, I, I, M, Y -> ""PIIMY"" not.
- P, D, D, M, Y -> ""PDDMY"" not.
- P, F, F, M, Y -> ""PFFMY"" not.
- P, K, K, M, Y -> ""PKKMY"" not.
- P, V, V, M, Y -> ""PVVMY"" not.
- P, W, W, M, Y -> ""PWWMY"" not.
- P, X, X, M, Y -> ""PXXMY"" not.
- P, Z, Z, M, Y -> ""PZZMY"" not.

Or mixed:
- P, D, G, M, Y -> ""PDGMY"" not a word.
- P, G, D, M, Y -> ""PGDMY"" not.
- P, H, G, M, Y -> ""PHGMY"" not.
- P, G, H, M, Y -> ""PGHMY"" not.
- P, I, G, M, Y -> ""PIGMY"" which is the same as ""PYGMY"", just different order? ""PIGMY"" would be P-I-G-M-Y, which is different from P-Y-G-M-Y.

""PIGMY"" is a variant spelling of ""pygmy"", but it might be accepted.

Let's try ""PIGMY"".

So guess: ""PIGMY""

But it's essentially the same as ""PYGMY"", just with I and Y swapped.

In ""PIGMY"", positions: 1:P, 2:I, 3:G, 4:M, 5:Y.

This uses available letters: I, G, Y are available.

And no duplicates.

So this should be valid.

Perhaps the system will accept it.

So let's guess ""pigmy"".

<guess>pigmy</guess>

But in the previous, we had ""pygmy"" which was rejected, so ""pigmy"" might be too.

Perhaps it's not in the word list.

Another word: ""P D A M N"" -> A and N absent.

No.

""P D E M P"" -> E absent and duplicate P.

No.

I think we have to go with ""pigmy"".

Or perhaps ""PYXIS"" but S absent.

No.

""PYGAL"" L absent.

No.

""PHYLA"" L and A absent.

No.

""PHYLE"" E absent.

No.

""P D G M P"" -> duplicate P and position 5 cannot be P.

No.

""P F G M P"" same.

No.

""P Y G M P"" -> position 5 cannot be P.

No.

So I think ""pigmy"" is worth a try.

If not, we might need to consider that the secret word has a letter we haven't tried.

Perhaps we missed a word.

Another possibility: ""P D M P H"" not a word.

""P H M P D"" not.

""P I M P S"" -> S absent.

No.

""P I M P Y"" -> ""PIMPY"" is a word? Meaning resembling a pimp. But position 4 is M, and in ""PIMPY"", position 3 is M? P-I-M-P-Y, so position 3 is M, position 4 is P. But we need position 4 to be M, so not.

Not good.

""P Y M P Y"" -> ""PYMPY"" not a word.

I think we must use ""pigmy"".

So let's guess that.After reviewing the feedback and the rejection of ""pygmy"" as an invalid word (despite it being a valid English word), I need to select a different 5-letter word that fits the constraints. The feedback from previous guesses is:

- **Guess 1: crane** → All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent.
- **Guess 2: stomp** → S, T, O are absent; M is correct and in position 4; P is present but misplaced (not in position 5).
- **Guess 3: plumb** → P is correct and in position 1; L, U, B are absent; M is correct and in position 4 (confirmed).

### Key Deductions:
- **Position 1 is P** (from ""plumb"" feedback).
- **Position 4 is M** (from ""stomp"" and confirmed in ""plumb"").
- **P must be in position 1, 2, or 3** (from ""stomp"" feedback, P is present but not in position 5; now confirmed at position 1).
- **Absent letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, T, O, L, U, B (all eliminated from previous feedback).
- **Available letters**: D, F, G, H, I, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (M and P are used, but no duplicates indicated yet, so we avoid them for maximum information).
- **Word structure**: P _ _ M _ (positions 2, 3, and 5 are unknown and must use available letters).

Since ""pygmy"" was rejected, I need an alternative word that fits the pattern and uses only available letters. After exploring options, the word **PIGMY** (a variant spelling of ""pygmy"") is a valid 5-letter word that meets the criteria:
- P (position 1), I (position 2), G (position 3), M (position 4), Y (position 5).
- All letters are from the available set (I, G, Y are available and not duplicates of P or M).
- This guess tests new letters (I, G, Y) and confirms the fixed P and M positions.

If ""PIGMY"" is not the secret word, the feedback will provide information on I, G, and Y, helping to narrow down the possibilities for the next guess.",Guess 5: pygmy -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) Y(✓) G(✓) M(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
