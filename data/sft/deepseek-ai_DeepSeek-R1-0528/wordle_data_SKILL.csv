We start with the initial guess ""crane"" and the feedback was all 'x'. That means none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
So we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We need a new 5-letter word that doesn't contain C, R, A, N, or E.

Now, to maximize information, we should try another set of common letters. Let's think of common letters not in the excluded set.

The excluded letters so far: C, R, A, N, E.

Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available vowels: O, I, U (since A, E are excluded)

Vowels are important. The word must contain some vowels. Common vowels include A, E, I, O, U. But A and E are out, so we focus on I, O, U.

We also want to use high-frequency consonants. Some common consonants in English: S, T, L, etc.

We should pick a word that uses novel letters to test as many as possible.

One common starting word, when avoiding these letters, might be ""SPOIL"" but let's check: 
SPOIL: S, P, O, I, L. None of these are in the excluded list? 
- S: not excluded
- P: not excluded
- O: not excluded
- I: not excluded
- L: not excluded

But actually, we have excluded C, R, A, N, E. So S,P,O,I,L are all available.

Alternatively, we could use ""TOILS"" or ""GHOUL"", but let's think of words that have more common letters.

Another word: ""BUOYS"" - B, U, O, Y, S. But B, U, O, Y, S are available. However, Y is sometimes a vowel, but it's allowed.

But perhaps we can choose a word with more common letters.

Word list possibilities: ""LIGHT"", ""MOIST"", ""BUOYS"", ""SPOIL"", etc.

We also don't want to include any excluded letters.

List of available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We want to cover vowels: O, I, U are available. Also Y can act as a vowel.

Common words:
- ""SPOIL"": letters S,P,O,I,L -> all available
- ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T -> available
- ""LIGHT"": L,I,G,H,T -> available
- ""DOUBT"": D,O,U,B,T -> available

But note: we want a word that doesn't repeat letters to maximize coverage.

I think ""SPOIL"" or ""MOIST"" are good choices.

Another classic one is ""ADIEU"" but A and E are excluded, so we cannot use that.

We could also try ""GHOUL"": G,H,O,U,L -> available.

But let me see frequency wise: S, T, L, and O are very common.

After excluding C,R,A,N,E, we can try a word with S, T, L, O, etc.

Word: ""SLOTH"" - S,L,O,T,H -> all available.

Another: ""TOUGH"" - T,O,U,G,H -> available.

But let's pick one that maximizes new letters.

We have 20 letters left, but we can only use five.

I recall that in Wordle, after eliminating some vowels, it's good to cover remaining vowels and common consonants.

Goal: find a word that uses I, O, U if possible? Not necessarily, but getting info about vowels is critical.

Vowels available: O, I, U. Also, sometimes Y.

We also need consonants.

So, let's choose a word that has two vowels and three consonants from the available letters.

For example: ""POINT"" -> P,O,I,N,T -> but N is excluded? Wait, guess1 feedback N was x, so N is excluded. So we cannot use ""POINT"" because N is excluded.

Similarly, we must avoid C,R,A,N,E.

So ""POINT"" has N -> excluded.

Similarly, ""QUERY"" has Q,U,E,R,Y -> but E and R are excluded -> invalid.

So avoiding the excluded letters.

Word: ""MOULD"" -> M,O,U,L,D -> all available? E is excluded, but O,U are vowels.

We can use ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T.
- M: available
- O: available
- I: available
- S: available
- T: available

Another option: ""SPOUT"" -> S,P,O,U,T -> O and U vowels.

But maybe ""MOIST"" is better because we cover O and I, which are common vowels.

Let's compare:
- ""MOIST"": M (less common? but used), O, I, S, T. S and T are very common consonants.
- ""SPOIL"": S,P,O,I,L. P and L are common too.

Another: ""BUILD"" -> B,U,I,L,D -> available.

But let's pick ""MOIST"" as a reasonable second guess.

We'll get feedback on M,O,I,S,T.

After this guess, we'll know if any of these are in the word and in which positions or not.

So, I'll go with ""moist"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, to maximize information gain, the next guess should avoid these letters entirely and introduce new common letters. ""MOIST"" uses five novel letters (M, O, I, S, T) that haven't been tested yet, including two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (M, S, T). This provides a broad coverage of high-frequency English letters and positions.

However, Y is sometimes a vowel, but it\'s allowed.\n\nBut perhaps we can choose a word with more common letters.\n\nWord list possibilities: ""LIGHT"", ""MOIST"", ""BUOYS"", ""SPOIL"", etc.\n\nWe also don\'t want to include any excluded letters.\n\nList of available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\n\nWe want to cover vowels: O, I, U are available. Also Y can act as a vowel.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""SPOIL"": letters S,P,O,I,L -> all available\n- ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T -> available\n- ""LIGHT"": L,I,G,H,T -> available\n- ""DOUBT"": D,O,U,B,T -> available\n\nBut note: we want a word that doesn\'t repeat letters to maximize coverage.\n\nI think ""SPOIL"" or ""MOIST"" are good choices.\n\nAnother classic one is ""ADIEU"" but A and E are excluded, so we cannot use that.\n\nWe could also try ""GHOUL"": G,H,O,U,L -> available.\n\nBut let me see frequency wise: S, T, L, and O are very common.\n\nAfter excluding C,R,A,N,E, we can try a word with S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nWord: ""SLOTH"" - S,L,O,T,H -> all available.\n\nAnother: ""TOUGH"" - T,O,U,G,H -> available.\n\nBut let\'s pick one that maximizes new letters.\n\nWe have 20 letters left, but we can only use five.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, after eliminating some vowels, it\'s good to cover remaining vowels and common consonants.\n\nGoal: find a word that uses I, O, U if possible? Not necessarily, but getting info about vowels is critical.\n\nVowels available: O, I, U. Also, sometimes Y.\n\nWe also need consonants.\n\nSo, let\'s choose a word that has two vowels and three consonants from the available letters.\n\nFor example: ""POINT"" -> P,O,I,N,T -> but N is excluded? Wait, guess1 feedback N was x, so N is excluded. So we cannot use ""POINT"" because N is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid C,R,A,N,E.\n\nSo ""POINT"" has N -> excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""QUERY"" has Q,U,E,R,Y -> but E and R are excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo avoiding the excluded letters.\n\nWord: ""MOULD"" -> M,O,U,L,D -> all available? E is excluded, but O,U are vowels.\n\nWe can use ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T.\n- M: available\n- O: available\n- I: available\n- S: available\n- T: available\n\nAnother option: ""SPOUT"" -> S,P,O,U,T -> O and U vowels.\n\nBut maybe ""MOIST"" is better because we cover O and I, which are common vowels.\n\nLet\'s compare:\n- ""MOIST"": M (less common? but used), O, I, S, T. S and T are very common consonants.\n- ""SPOIL"": S,P,O,I,L. P and L are common too.\n\nAnother: ""BUILD"" -> B,U,I,L,D -> available.\n\nBut let\'s pick ""MOIST"" as a reasonable second guess.\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on M,O,I,S,T.\n\nAfter this guess, we\'ll know if any of these are in the word and in which positions or not.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""moist"".Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, to maximize information gain, the next guess should avoid these letters entirely and introduce new common letters. ""MOIST"" uses five novel letters (M, O, I, S, T) that haven\'t been tested yet, including two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (M, S, T). This provides a broad coverage of high-frequency English letters and positions.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) T(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So none of C,R,A,N,E are in the secret word.

2. Guess 2: ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), T(x)

This means:
- I is correct and in the third position (since I was in position 3 of ""moist"" and got a ✓). So the secret word has I as its third letter.
- S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since S was in position 4 and got a -). So S is present elsewhere in the word.
- M, O, and T are not in the word at all (all x).

Therefore, we now know:
- The third letter must be I.
- The word contains S, but not in the fourth position. Since the third position is I, S cannot be there. So S must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Also, the word does not contain M, O, T (from the x's in guess 2) and already we know it doesn't contain C,R,A,N,E (from guess 1).

Excluded letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T

Included letters: S (somewhere, not in position 4) and definitely I in position 3.

We must form a 5-letter word with:
- Position 3: I
- S must be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (but not 3 or 4).

Also, the word cannot have any excluded letters.

Available letters: We can use any letters except: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T.

List of available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
Available vowels: I,U (since I is already used, but can have another? But I is in position 3, and we can have another I? The feedback doesn't necessarily rule out multiple I's. However, in the previous guess, if there were two I's, we might have gotten a feedback for the other I? But in ""moist"", there's only one I. So we don't know if there are multiple I's. But typically, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters.

However, to be safe, we should consider the possibility of repeated letters.

But let's proceed.

We need to form a word that has:
- Third letter: I
- Contains S, in position 1, 2, or 5.
- No letters from the excluded set.

Possible words:

We can try to pick words that test new letters while incorporating the known I and S.

Since S must be placed in position 1, 2, or 5, we can consider each case separately? But we don't know yet.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in one of these positions and includes new letters for the other positions.

Available vowels: I and U (a is excluded, e excluded, o excluded). Also, Y can sometimes be used as a vowel.

We should consider words that use U as a vowel if possible.

What are possible examples?

Start with:

- Position 1: ? (any available letter)
- Position 2: ? 
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

With S being one of positions 1,2,5.

We also want to include new letters to get more information.

So, let's think of words with I in the third position and S present.

List of possible words:
- Possible: ... with pattern: _S_I_ ? But S must not be in position 4? And position 3 fixed.

Examples:

- S in position 1: Words like ""S?I??"": e.g., ""SKILL"", but K is available? But ""skill"" has double L? Also, ""skill"" has S in first position and I in third? Wait: S,K,I,L,L -> positions: S(1), K(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). But we know S must be present and in a wrong position? Actually, in guess 2, S was in position 4 and got a minus, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. In this word ""skill"" if S is in position 1, that's acceptable. But wait, we got a minus for S, meaning that S is in the word but not where we placed it (position 4). Then, in this new guess, placing S in position 1 would be okay.

But in ""skill"", we have S at position 1 and L at 4 and 5. But we don't know if L is in the word.

Similarly, other words: ""SPIKE"" -> but E is excluded.

""SPIKY"" -> I in third? S(1),P(2),I(3),K(4),Y(5). This uses P,K,Y which are available? And S in position 1.

Then, the word would have S in position 1? But in guess 2, S was marked as present but in wrong position (position 4). If we guess a word with S in position 1, then:
- If the actual word has S and its correct position is 1, we should get a check for S at position 1.
- If S's true position is somewhere else, then it might get a minus if we put it at 1 and it should be elsewhere.

Similarly, if we put S in position 2, etc.

We need to avoid S in position 4 because we know it's not there.

Another word: ""SWIFT"" -> S(1),W(2),I(3),F(4),T(5). But T is excluded? From guess 2, T got (x), so T is not in the word. So ""SWIFT"" has T -> invalid.

Similarly, cannot use T.

Another: We'll avoid T.

Possible words:

Option: Put S in position 5? Like __I_S

Words: ""ALIBS"" but A excluded.

""GUILD"" -> G,U,I,L,D -> I is in position 3. S is not present? We must include S because it's in the word. Our guess must contain S? No, not necessarily. Our guess doesn't have to contain S, but since we know S is in the word, if we don't include it, we might get an S x, but we already know S is present. However, to confirm its position, we can try to place S in another spot.

But ideally, we want to include S to verify where it goes.

Similarly, we can test other positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to find the S location.

But we have letter constraints.

Let me list words with I in third position and S included.

Possible words:

- S in position 1: e.g., ""SPIKY"" (if Y allowed), or ""SHIP?"" ... but 5 letters.

5-letter words with pattern S?I??

- ""SKIMP"": S,K,I,M,P -> but M is excluded? Guess 2 said M(x). So M not in word.
- ""SKILL"": S,K,I,L,L -> K and L available? Yes. But we have double L? The word can have repeated letters? Possible.
- ""SKINT"": but N and T excluded.
- ""SKIRT"": R excluded.
- ""SHIFT"": F and T? T excluded.
- ""SHILL"": S,H,I,L,L -> H,L available? Yes.
- ""SHING"" not a word.
- ""SPILL"": S,P,I,L,L -> P and L available? Yes.

But S is placed in position 1.

Now, position 5: we can have S? If we put S in a new position.

But recall, in guess 2, S was placed in position 4 and got a minus. So if in secret S is also in position 4? No, the minus means S is not in position 4. So placement of S in position 1 might get check or minus.

Similarly, S in position 2: words like ?S?I?

- ""USING"": U,S,I,N,G -> N excluded? Guess 1, N(x).
- ""PSIGN"" not a word.
- ""BASIC"": B,A,S,I,C -> A and C excluded.

Not many.

S in position 5: pattern ???IS? No, ???I_? with S at the end? So pattern __I_S

Words:
- ""TWINS"" but T excluded.
- ""GUILS"" not a word? ""GUILD"" no S.
- ""FLAIS"" not a word.
- ""POLIS"" O excluded? Guess 2 O(x).
- ""VALID"" A excluded.
- ""BLIPS"" but L,I,P,S: B,L,I,P,S -> positions: B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). I is at position 3? Yes.

""BLIPS"" -> B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). Now, S is in position 5. Also, avoid excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> B,L,P,S,I: are these excluded? B not excluded, L not, P not, I not excluded (but we know I is in word?), S not excluded.

In the secret word, we know I is at position 3 and S is present (somewhere else). So ""BLIPS"" has I at position 3 and S at position 5. We don't know about B,L,P.

Also, S is placed at position 5: if S is at position 5 in the secret, we get a check; if S is somewhere else (like position 1 or 2) then putting it at 5 would get a minus? Because it would be wrong position.

Similarly, if S is at position 5, we get ✓ for S.

Now, other words: ""KLUTZ"" but K,L,U,T,Z -> T excluded.

Another: ""JUICE"" E excluded.

""QUIPS"" -> Q,U,I,P,S -> positions: Q(1),U(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). Q,U,P,S available? Yes.

But Q is less common.

""KLUIS"" not standard.

Also, note that in ""moist"", position 4 got S(-), meaning S is present elsewhere. So it could be at position 1,2 or 5.

Now, with available letters, let me choose a word that includes S and I at position 3, and tests new letters.

One good word might be ""PULIS"" but that's not standard; usually ""PULIS"" is not recognized. Or ""DOUOS"" no.

Standard words: ""SUSHI"" -> S,U,S,H,I -> positions: S(1),U(2),S(3),H(4),I(5). I is at position 5? But we need I at position 3. So not.

""SPIKE"" E excluded.

""SHILY"" -> S,H,I,L,Y -> positions: S(1),H(2),I(3),L(4),Y(5). This seems valid: S at 1, I at 3.

Letters: S,H,L,Y available and not excluded.

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> H,L,Y available? Yes.

But in this word:
- Position 1: S -> if S is at position 1 in secret, we get ✓; otherwise -
- Position 3: I ✓ (we know that)
- Position 4: L -> this is a new letter, so if L is at position 4 in secret, we get information.
- Position 5: Y -> new letter.

Position 2: H -> new.

But if we place S at position 1 and it turns out S is not at 1, we might get - or x? Since S is present, if not at position 1, it would get a minus because it exists elsewhere. But we already know S is in the word, so if S is at position 1 and correct, it will be ✓; if S is at position 2 or 5 in secret, then placing S at position 1 would get a minus (wrong position).

Similarly for ""BLIPS"" etc.

Another word: ""BLISS"" -> B,L,I,S,S. Double S? But I at position 3? B(1),L(2),I(3),S(4),S(5). But position 4: S, but in guess 2 S was at position 4 and got a minus, meaning S is not at position 4. Placing S again at position 4 would likely also get a minus? But if the word has S only once, then putting S at position 4 might get x if S is not present, but we know S is present. So the feedback for position 4 would be - or ✓? It would depend.

Actually, since we know S is in the word, and we're testing position 4 again? But initially, we were told S is not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4 again, it will still get a minus because the correct position is elsewhere. And we might not learn anything new.

In fact, if S is not at position 4, putting S anywhere else that's not the correct position would get a minus. Only if we put it in the correct position we get ✓.

Therefore, to test position 1,2 or 5 for S, we can place S there and see if we get ✓.

In this guess, we can put S in position 1, for example, to see if it's correct.

Similarly, position 2 or 5.

Also, we need to avoid position 4.

Given the letters available, let's find common words.

Possible word with S in position 1: ""SHINY"" but H,I,N,Y: N excluded? Yes, guess 1 N(x).

Not.

""SHILY"": S,H,I,L,Y -> H(2), L(4), Y(5). Available letters? H,L,Y available.

Can we use ""shily""? Meaning: in a shy manner? It's a valid word.

Similarly, alternatives: ""SKILLY"" too many letters? No.

""SLILY"" S,L,I,L,Y: S(1),L(2),I(3),L(4),Y(5). Double L? Possible.

""SLIMY"" but M excluded.

So ""SHILY"" seems decent.

With S at position 1: if the secret word has S at position 1, we get ✓ for S; if S is at position 2, we get - for S (since it's present but wrong position if placed at 1); similarly for position 5? No: placing S at 1, if S should be at 5, then S at position 1 is wrong position, so minus.

Therefore, by placing S at position 1, we can distinguish between S being at position 1 or elsewhere (minus means S must be at position 2 or 5).

Similarly, we get info about H,L,Y.

But Y may be less common; we could test more common consonants.

Another option: Put S in position 2.

For example, ""PSYCH"" too long.

""PSION"" P,S,I,O,N -> O excluded, N excluded.

Not.

""USUAL"" U,S,U,A,L -> A excluded and double U.

Not.

""EXPEL"" E and X? E excluded.

Not.

Put S in position 5: pattern ???IS

Words: 
- ""BITES"" E excluded.
- ""WILLIS"" too long.
- ""PENIS"" E excluded? And P,E,N,I,S: E and N excluded.
- ""LUPUS"" L,U,P,U,S -> double U. U is available, but double U? Uncommon.
- ""FOCUS"" O excluded.
- ""GENUS"" E and G? E excluded.

Perhaps ""BLISS"" as mentioned earlier? But S in position 4 and 5? And position 4 S would get minus again? Avoid position 4.

So words with S at position 5 and no S elsewhere? And I at position 3.

Pattern: ??I?S

Examples:
- ""HUMUS"" H,U,M,U,S -> M excluded.
- ""TIBBS"" T excluded.
- ""DILLS"" D,I,L,L,S -> I at position 2? No, position 3 needed. ??I?S: so letter 3 must be I? So D?I?S? ""DILIS""? Not a word.

Words like: with letters 1,2,4 available and 5=S.

So for example: _ _ I _ S

What words? ""AXIIS"" not, A excluded.

""KILPS"" K,I,L,P,S -> positions: K(1),I(2)? No, I must be at 3.

So it must be letter 3 is I, so pattern: first letter: ?, second letter: ?, third: I, fourth: ?, fifth: S.

Words: ""POINT"" O excluded.
""QUAIS"" Q,U,A,I,S -> A excluded.
""GUILS"" G,U,I,L,S -> positions: G(1),U(2),I(3),L(4),S(5). Yes, L at position 4.

S at position 5. Avoid S at position 4, which we do.

Letters: G,U,I,L,S. But I and S already known? G,U,L new.

Excluded letters? C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T — G,U,L are available.

""GUILS"" is a word? ""Guils"" might be plural of ""guil"" — not standard. ""GUIL"" is not a common word. Better to go with ""GUILD"" but D available? ""GUILD"" has no S.

Is there a word ""GUI LS""? No.

Another: ""BUILT"" U,I,L,T -> T excluded? Guess 2 T(x), cannot.

""FLUID"" F,L,U,I,D -> I at position 4? F(1),L(2),U(3),I(4),D(5). But need I at position 3. Not.

So the word must have I at position 3.

Common word: ""BLIPS"" again? B,L,I,P,S -> S at 5? B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). Or ""QUIPS"" Q,U,I,P,S.

But BLIPS: B,L,I,P,S

We can use ""BLIPS"" even though P is less common.

Perhaps ""SHIPS"" -> S,H,I,P,S -> double S? And S at position 1 and 5? But we have S at position 1? Let's see: S(1),H(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). But position 4: P? And S also at 5.

But position 4: P. We could get feedback for P.

Drawback: S appears twice? But in the secret word, we know S is at least once. Could there be two S?

We don't know.

But ""SHIPS"" has S at position 1 and 5. If we guess, position 1 S: if S is at position 1, we get ✓; else -? But if S is also at position 5, and we have S at position 5, if that's correct, we get ✓ for it.

But this might complicate.

Perhaps choose a word without repeated letters to simplify.

Back to ""SHILY"": S,H,I,L,Y -> all distinct letters: S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

This seems reasonable.

Another word: ""WHISK"" W,H,I,S,K -> positions: W(1),H(2),I(3),S(4),K(5). But position 4: S? We were told S is not in position 4? In ""moist"" we guessed S at position 4 and got minus, meaning S is not at position 4. Therefore, in this guess, if we put S at position 4 again, it will also get minus (or if there are two S, it might be different, but risky). So better to avoid position 4 for S.

So ""WHISK"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.

Therefore, ""SHILY"" with S at position 1, or ""GUILS"" if we assume it's valid? No, ""GUILS"" is not standard.

Standard words: ""SHULS"" S,H,U,L,S? Double S and structure.

Perhaps ""DAISY"" D,A,I,S,Y -> A excluded.

""FUSIL"": F,U,S,I,L -> positions: F(1),U(2),S(3),I(4),L(5). But I is at position 4, not 3? Need I at position 3.

Not.

""USUAL"" has no I.

I think ""SHILY"" or ""BLIPS"" or ""QUIPS"" are options.

""BLIPS"" seems valid: B,L,I,P,S -> positions: B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5)

S is at position 5.

Similarly, ""PULIS"" not good.

Another word: ""GLIBS"" -> G,L,I,B,S? G(1),L(2),I(3),B(4),S(5)

Or ""SPIVS"" -> S at 1, but double S at end? And P,I,V,S — V available.

But V uncommon.

Perhaps ""SHILY"" is better.

Or, to include U? ""QUIPS"" Q,U,I,P,S -> Q(1),U(2),I(3),P(4),S(5)

Using Q is very rare; so not ideal for information gain.

Therefore, I'll go with ""BLIPS"" or ""SHILY"".

Let's choose ""SHILY"".

Or ""BLISS"" but avoid position 4 S.

How about ""SWISH""? S at 1 and 5? S(1),W(2),I(3),S(4),H(5). Again S at position 4 -> avoid.

Position 4 we should avoid for S? Only if we suspect S might be there, we know it's not. So if we put S at position 4, we get a minus, which is expected, so we don't test new position.

So we should avoid position 4 for S in this guess? To potentially find S's position.

Thus, words with S at position 1,2, or 5.

Another word: S in position 2, like ""FSILS"" not word.

""ASIDE"" A excluded.

I think ""SHILY"" is a good choice.

Meaning of ""SHILY"": adverb, shyly? Sometimes spelled ""shily"".

In Wordle, it might be accepted.

To be safe, ""BLIPS"" is a valid word meaning something.

I'll choose ""BLIPS"".

But you have to test position 4 with P.

Either is fine.

Since we have position 3 fixed, and S must be placed, and feedback will give info on the position of S.

For example, with ""SHILY"":

- If S is at position 1, S in guess should be ✓.
- If S is at position 2 or 5, S in position 1 should be - (since present but wrong position).

Similarly for other placements.

Also, L at position 4: if the secret word has L at position 4, we get a new ✓; if L is present elsewhere, we get -; if not, x.

But we don't know about L.

Similarly, Y at position 5: same.

But Y is less common; so maybe ""BLIPS"" with more common letters? B,L,I,P,S — P is less common than Y? Perhaps.

Another word: ""SLICK"" but C excluded? C is excluded.

""SLIVY"" not a word.

""SHIPS"" — but has S at position 1 and P at 4? Position 4: P. Then S at 1 and at 5? ""SHIPS"" is S,H,I,P,S — but 5-letter are positions: S(1),H(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). So it has two S.

But that's acceptable if we allow double L.

But in terms of feedback, if we put P at position 4, we get information about P.

Similarly, for the second S at 5? But if S is only one, then S at position 5 might be x or -, but if the secret has two S, etc.

Complicated.

Stick with distinct letters: ""SHILY"" or ""BLIPS"".

I'll go with ""SHILY"".

But ""SHILY"" contains Y which can be both vowel and consonant, but should be fine.

Perhaps ""BUILD"" but no S.

Not.

Decision: guess ""SHILY"".

After feedback we'll know more.

So:

<guess>shily</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- No letters from ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word.
- None of M, O, T are in the secret word.
- The third letter is I (✓ from ""moist"").
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (- from ""moist"").

Therefore, for the next guess:
- Must have I in position 3.
- Must include S in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 4 is invalid).
- Must avoid letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, etc.).

""SHILY"" was chosen because:
- It places S in position 1 to test if S belongs at position 1 (✓ or - feedback).
- It has I in position 3 (known to be correct).
- It introduces new letters: H (position 2), L (position 4), Y (position 5), all of which are available and common.
- It uses distinct letters to maximize information.

<guess>shily</guess>",shily,"We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So none of C,R,A,N,E are in the secret word.

2. Guess 2: ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), T(x)

This means:
- I is correct and in the third position (since I was in position 3 of ""moist"" and got a ✓). So the secret word has I as its third letter.
- S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since S was in position 4 and got a -). So S is present elsewhere in the word.
- M, O, and T are not in the word at all (all x).

Therefore, we now know:
- The third letter must be I.
- The word contains S, but not in the fourth position. Since the third position is I, S cannot be there. So S must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Also, the word does not contain M, O, T (from the x's in guess 2) and already we know it doesn't contain C,R,A,N,E (from guess 1).

Excluded letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T

Included letters: S (somewhere, not in position 4) and definitely I in position 3.

We must form a 5-letter word with:
- Position 3: I
- S must be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (but not 3 or 4).

Also, the word cannot have any excluded letters.

Available letters: We can use any letters except: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T.

List of available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
Available vowels: I,U (since I is already used, but can have another? But I is in position 3, and we can have another I? The feedback doesn't necessarily rule out multiple I's. However, in the previous guess, if there were two I's, we might have gotten a feedback for the other I? But in ""moist"", there's only one I. So we don't know if there are multiple I's. But typically, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters.

However, to be safe, we should consider the possibility of repeated letters.

But let's proceed.

We need to form a word that has:
- Third letter: I
- Contains S, in position 1, 2, or 5.
- No letters from the excluded set.

Possible words:

We can try to pick words that test new letters while incorporating the known I and S.

Since S must be placed in position 1, 2, or 5, we can consider each case separately? But we don't know yet.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in one of these positions and includes new letters for the other positions.

Available vowels: I and U (a is excluded, e excluded, o excluded). Also, Y can sometimes be used as a vowel.

We should consider words that use U as a vowel if possible.

What are possible examples?

Start with:

- Position 1: ? (any available letter)
- Position 2: ? 
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

With S being one of positions 1,2,5.

We also want to include new letters to get more information.

So, let's think of words with I in the third position and S present.

List of possible words:
- Possible: ... with pattern: _S_I_ ? But S must not be in position 4? And position 3 fixed.

Examples:

- S in position 1: Words like ""S?I??"": e.g., ""SKILL"", but K is available? But ""skill"" has double L? Also, ""skill"" has S in first position and I in third? Wait: S,K,I,L,L -> positions: S(1), K(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). But we know S must be present and in a wrong position? Actually, in guess 2, S was in position 4 and got a minus, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. In this word ""skill"" if S is in position 1, that's acceptable. But wait, we got a minus for S, meaning that S is in the word but not where we placed it (position 4). Then, in this new guess, placing S in position 1 would be okay.

But in ""skill"", we have S at position 1 and L at 4 and 5. But we don't know if L is in the word.

Similarly, other words: ""SPIKE"" -> but E is excluded.

""SPIKY"" -> I in third? S(1),P(2),I(3),K(4),Y(5). This uses P,K,Y which are available? And S in position 1.

Then, the word would have S in position 1? But in guess 2, S was marked as present but in wrong position (position 4). If we guess a word with S in position 1, then:
- If the actual word has S and its correct position is 1, we should get a check for S at position 1.
- If S's true position is somewhere else, then it might get a minus if we put it at 1 and it should be elsewhere.

Similarly, if we put S in position 2, etc.

We need to avoid S in position 4 because we know it's not there.

Another word: ""SWIFT"" -> S(1),W(2),I(3),F(4),T(5). But T is excluded? From guess 2, T got (x), so T is not in the word. So ""SWIFT"" has T -> invalid.

Similarly, cannot use T.

Another: We'll avoid T.

Possible words:

Option: Put S in position 5? Like __I_S

Words: ""ALIBS"" but A excluded.

""GUILD"" -> G,U,I,L,D -> I is in position 3. S is not present? We must include S because it's in the word. Our guess must contain S? No, not necessarily. Our guess doesn't have to contain S, but since we know S is in the word, if we don't include it, we might get an S x, but we already know S is present. However, to confirm its position, we can try to place S in another spot.

But ideally, we want to include S to verify where it goes.

Similarly, we can test other positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to find the S location.

But we have letter constraints.

Let me list words with I in third position and S included.

Possible words:

- S in position 1: e.g., ""SPIKY"" (if Y allowed), or ""SHIP?"" ... but 5 letters.

5-letter words with pattern S?I??

- ""SKIMP"": S,K,I,M,P -> but M is excluded? Guess 2 said M(x). So M not in word.
- ""SKILL"": S,K,I,L,L -> K and L available? Yes. But we have double L? The word can have repeated letters? Possible.
- ""SKINT"": but N and T excluded.
- ""SKIRT"": R excluded.
- ""SHIFT"": F and T? T excluded.
- ""SHILL"": S,H,I,L,L -> H,L available? Yes.
- ""SHING"" not a word.
- ""SPILL"": S,P,I,L,L -> P and L available? Yes.

But S is placed in position 1.

Now, position 5: we can have S? If we put S in a new position.

But recall, in guess 2, S was placed in position 4 and got a minus. So if in secret S is also in position 4? No, the minus means S is not in position 4. So placement of S in position 1 might get check or minus.

Similarly, S in position 2: words like ?S?I?

- ""USING"": U,S,I,N,G -> N excluded? Guess 1, N(x).
- ""PSIGN"" not a word.
- ""BASIC"": B,A,S,I,C -> A and C excluded.

Not many.

S in position 5: pattern ???IS? No, ???I_? with S at the end? So pattern __I_S

Words:
- ""TWINS"" but T excluded.
- ""GUILS"" not a word? ""GUILD"" no S.
- ""FLAIS"" not a word.
- ""POLIS"" O excluded? Guess 2 O(x).
- ""VALID"" A excluded.
- ""BLIPS"" but L,I,P,S: B,L,I,P,S -> positions: B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). I is at position 3? Yes.

""BLIPS"" -> B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). Now, S is in position 5. Also, avoid excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> B,L,P,S,I: are these excluded? B not excluded, L not, P not, I not excluded (but we know I is in word?), S not excluded.

In the secret word, we know I is at position 3 and S is present (somewhere else). So ""BLIPS"" has I at position 3 and S at position 5. We don't know about B,L,P.

Also, S is placed at position 5: if S is at position 5 in the secret, we get a check; if S is somewhere else (like position 1 or 2) then putting it at 5 would get a minus? Because it would be wrong position.

Similarly, if S is at position 5, we get ✓ for S.

Now, other words: ""KLUTZ"" but K,L,U,T,Z -> T excluded.

Another: ""JUICE"" E excluded.

""QUIPS"" -> Q,U,I,P,S -> positions: Q(1),U(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). Q,U,P,S available? Yes.

But Q is less common.

""KLUIS"" not standard.

Also, note that in ""moist"", position 4 got S(-), meaning S is present elsewhere. So it could be at position 1,2 or 5.

Now, with available letters, let me choose a word that includes S and I at position 3, and tests new letters.

One good word might be ""PULIS"" but that's not standard; usually ""PULIS"" is not recognized. Or ""DOUOS"" no.

Standard words: ""SUSHI"" -> S,U,S,H,I -> positions: S(1),U(2),S(3),H(4),I(5). I is at position 5? But we need I at position 3. So not.

""SPIKE"" E excluded.

""SHILY"" -> S,H,I,L,Y -> positions: S(1),H(2),I(3),L(4),Y(5). This seems valid: S at 1, I at 3.

Letters: S,H,L,Y available and not excluded.

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> H,L,Y available? Yes.

But in this word:
- Position 1: S -> if S is at position 1 in secret, we get ✓; otherwise -
- Position 3: I ✓ (we know that)
- Position 4: L -> this is a new letter, so if L is at position 4 in secret, we get information.
- Position 5: Y -> new letter.

Position 2: H -> new.

But if we place S at position 1 and it turns out S is not at 1, we might get - or x? Since S is present, if not at position 1, it would get a minus because it exists elsewhere. But we already know S is in the word, so if S is at position 1 and correct, it will be ✓; if S is at position 2 or 5 in secret, then placing S at position 1 would get a minus (wrong position).

Similarly for ""BLIPS"" etc.

Another word: ""BLISS"" -> B,L,I,S,S. Double S? But I at position 3? B(1),L(2),I(3),S(4),S(5). But position 4: S, but in guess 2 S was at position 4 and got a minus, meaning S is not at position 4. Placing S again at position 4 would likely also get a minus? But if the word has S only once, then putting S at position 4 might get x if S is not present, but we know S is present. So the feedback for position 4 would be - or ✓? It would depend.

Actually, since we know S is in the word, and we're testing position 4 again? But initially, we were told S is not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4 again, it will still get a minus because the correct position is elsewhere. And we might not learn anything new.

In fact, if S is not at position 4, putting S anywhere else that's not the correct position would get a minus. Only if we put it in the correct position we get ✓.

Therefore, to test position 1,2 or 5 for S, we can place S there and see if we get ✓.

In this guess, we can put S in position 1, for example, to see if it's correct.

Similarly, position 2 or 5.

Also, we need to avoid position 4.

Given the letters available, let's find common words.

Possible word with S in position 1: ""SHINY"" but H,I,N,Y: N excluded? Yes, guess 1 N(x).

Not.

""SHILY"": S,H,I,L,Y -> H(2), L(4), Y(5). Available letters? H,L,Y available.

Can we use ""shily""? Meaning: in a shy manner? It's a valid word.

Similarly, alternatives: ""SKILLY"" too many letters? No.

""SLILY"" S,L,I,L,Y: S(1),L(2),I(3),L(4),Y(5). Double L? Possible.

""SLIMY"" but M excluded.

So ""SHILY"" seems decent.

With S at position 1: if the secret word has S at position 1, we get ✓ for S; if S is at position 2, we get - for S (since it's present but wrong position if placed at 1); similarly for position 5? No: placing S at 1, if S should be at 5, then S at position 1 is wrong position, so minus.

Therefore, by placing S at position 1, we can distinguish between S being at position 1 or elsewhere (minus means S must be at position 2 or 5).

Similarly, we get info about H,L,Y.

But Y may be less common; we could test more common consonants.

Another option: Put S in position 2.

For example, ""PSYCH"" too long.

""PSION"" P,S,I,O,N -> O excluded, N excluded.

Not.

""USUAL"" U,S,U,A,L -> A excluded and double U.

Not.

""EXPEL"" E and X? E excluded.

Not.

Put S in position 5: pattern ???IS

Words: 
- ""BITES"" E excluded.
- ""WILLIS"" too long.
- ""PENIS"" E excluded? And P,E,N,I,S: E and N excluded.
- ""LUPUS"" L,U,P,U,S -> double U. U is available, but double U? Uncommon.
- ""FOCUS"" O excluded.
- ""GENUS"" E and G? E excluded.

Perhaps ""BLISS"" as mentioned earlier? But S in position 4 and 5? And position 4 S would get minus again? Avoid position 4.

So words with S at position 5 and no S elsewhere? And I at position 3.

Pattern: ??I?S

Examples:
- ""HUMUS"" H,U,M,U,S -> M excluded.
- ""TIBBS"" T excluded.
- ""DILLS"" D,I,L,L,S -> I at position 2? No, position 3 needed. ??I?S: so letter 3 must be I? So D?I?S? ""DILIS""? Not a word.

Words like: with letters 1,2,4 available and 5=S.

So for example: _ _ I _ S

What words? ""AXIIS"" not, A excluded.

""KILPS"" K,I,L,P,S -> positions: K(1),I(2)? No, I must be at 3.

So it must be letter 3 is I, so pattern: first letter: ?, second letter: ?, third: I, fourth: ?, fifth: S.

Words: ""POINT"" O excluded.
""QUAIS"" Q,U,A,I,S -> A excluded.
""GUILS"" G,U,I,L,S -> positions: G(1),U(2),I(3),L(4),S(5). Yes, L at position 4.

S at position 5. Avoid S at position 4, which we do.

Letters: G,U,I,L,S. But I and S already known? G,U,L new.

Excluded letters? C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T — G,U,L are available.

""GUILS"" is a word? ""Guils"" might be plural of ""guil"" — not standard. ""GUIL"" is not a common word. Better to go with ""GUILD"" but D available? ""GUILD"" has no S.

Is there a word ""GUI LS""? No.

Another: ""BUILT"" U,I,L,T -> T excluded? Guess 2 T(x), cannot.

""FLUID"" F,L,U,I,D -> I at position 4? F(1),L(2),U(3),I(4),D(5). But need I at position 3. Not.

So the word must have I at position 3.

Common word: ""BLIPS"" again? B,L,I,P,S -> S at 5? B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). Or ""QUIPS"" Q,U,I,P,S.

But BLIPS: B,L,I,P,S

We can use ""BLIPS"" even though P is less common.

Perhaps ""SHIPS"" -> S,H,I,P,S -> double S? And S at position 1 and 5? But we have S at position 1? Let's see: S(1),H(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). But position 4: P? And S also at 5.

But position 4: P. We could get feedback for P.

Drawback: S appears twice? But in the secret word, we know S is at least once. Could there be two S?

We don't know.

But ""SHIPS"" has S at position 1 and 5. If we guess, position 1 S: if S is at position 1, we get ✓; else -? But if S is also at position 5, and we have S at position 5, if that's correct, we get ✓ for it.

But this might complicate.

Perhaps choose a word without repeated letters to simplify.

Back to ""SHILY"": S,H,I,L,Y -> all distinct letters: S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

This seems reasonable.

Another word: ""WHISK"" W,H,I,S,K -> positions: W(1),H(2),I(3),S(4),K(5). But position 4: S? We were told S is not in position 4? In ""moist"" we guessed S at position 4 and got minus, meaning S is not at position 4. Therefore, in this guess, if we put S at position 4 again, it will also get minus (or if there are two S, it might be different, but risky). So better to avoid position 4 for S.

So ""WHISK"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.

Therefore, ""SHILY"" with S at position 1, or ""GUILS"" if we assume it's valid? No, ""GUILS"" is not standard.

Standard words: ""SHULS"" S,H,U,L,S? Double S and structure.

Perhaps ""DAISY"" D,A,I,S,Y -> A excluded.

""FUSIL"": F,U,S,I,L -> positions: F(1),U(2),S(3),I(4),L(5). But I is at position 4, not 3? Need I at position 3.

Not.

""USUAL"" has no I.

I think ""SHILY"" or ""BLIPS"" or ""QUIPS"" are options.

""BLIPS"" seems valid: B,L,I,P,S -> positions: B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5)

S is at position 5.

Similarly, ""PULIS"" not good.

Another word: ""GLIBS"" -> G,L,I,B,S? G(1),L(2),I(3),B(4),S(5)

Or ""SPIVS"" -> S at 1, but double S at end? And P,I,V,S — V available.

But V uncommon.

Perhaps ""SHILY"" is better.

Or, to include U? ""QUIPS"" Q,U,I,P,S -> Q(1),U(2),I(3),P(4),S(5)

Using Q is very rare; so not ideal for information gain.

Therefore, I'll go with ""BLIPS"" or ""SHILY"".

Let's choose ""SHILY"".

Or ""BLISS"" but avoid position 4 S.

How about ""SWISH""? S at 1 and 5? S(1),W(2),I(3),S(4),H(5). Again S at position 4 -> avoid.

Position 4 we should avoid for S? Only if we suspect S might be there, we know it's not. So if we put S at position 4, we get a minus, which is expected, so we don't test new position.

So we should avoid position 4 for S in this guess? To potentially find S's position.

Thus, words with S at position 1,2, or 5.

Another word: S in position 2, like ""FSILS"" not word.

""ASIDE"" A excluded.

I think ""SHILY"" is a good choice.

Meaning of ""SHILY"": adverb, shyly? Sometimes spelled ""shily"".

In Wordle, it might be accepted.

To be safe, ""BLIPS"" is a valid word meaning something.

I'll choose ""BLIPS"".

But you have to test position 4 with P.

Either is fine.

Since we have position 3 fixed, and S must be placed, and feedback will give info on the position of S.

For example, with ""SHILY"":

- If S is at position 1, S in guess should be ✓.
- If S is at position 2 or 5, S in position 1 should be - (since present but wrong position).

Similarly for other placements.

Also, L at position 4: if the secret word has L at position 4, we get a new ✓; if L is present elsewhere, we get -; if not, x.

But we don't know about L.

Similarly, Y at position 5: same.

But Y is less common; so maybe ""BLIPS"" with more common letters? B,L,I,P,S — P is less common than Y? Perhaps.

Another word: ""SLICK"" but C excluded? C is excluded.

""SLIVY"" not a word.

""SHIPS"" — but has S at position 1 and P at 4? Position 4: P. Then S at 1 and at 5? ""SHIPS"" is S,H,I,P,S — but 5-letter are positions: S(1),H(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). So it has two S.

But that's acceptable if we allow double L.

But in terms of feedback, if we put P at position 4, we get information about P.

Similarly, for the second S at 5? But if S is only one, then S at position 5 might be x or -, but if the secret has two S, etc.

Complicated.

Stick with distinct letters: ""SHILY"" or ""BLIPS"".

I'll go with ""SHILY"".

But ""SHILY"" contains Y which can be both vowel and consonant, but should be fine.

Perhaps ""BUILD"" but no S.

Not.

Decision: guess ""SHILY"".

After feedback we'll know more.

So:

<guess>shily</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- No letters from ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word.
- None of M, O, T are in the secret word.
- The third letter is I (✓ from ""moist"").
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (- from ""moist"").

Therefore, for the next guess:
- Must have I in position 3.
- Must include S in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 4 is invalid).
- Must avoid letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, etc.).

""SHILY"" was chosen because:
- It places S in position 1 to test if S belongs at position 1 (✓ or - feedback).
- It has I in position 3 (known to be correct).
- It introduces new letters: H (position 2), L (position 4), Y (position 5), all of which are available and common.
- It uses distinct letters to maximize information.",Guess 3: shily -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) H(x) I(✓) L(✓) Y(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,SKILL,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information we get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let me choose ""CRANE"" as it has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels (A, E) and common consonants (C, R, N).

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We start with the initial guess ""crane"" and the feedback was all 'x'. That means none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
So we must avoid using these letters in our next guess.

We need a new 5-letter word that doesn't contain C, R, A, N, or E.

Now, to maximize information, we should try another set of common letters. Let's think of common letters not in the excluded set.

The excluded letters so far: C, R, A, N, E.

Available consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
Available vowels: O, I, U (since A, E are excluded)

Vowels are important. The word must contain some vowels. Common vowels include A, E, I, O, U. But A and E are out, so we focus on I, O, U.

We also want to use high-frequency consonants. Some common consonants in English: S, T, L, etc.

We should pick a word that uses novel letters to test as many as possible.

One common starting word, when avoiding these letters, might be ""SPOIL"" but let's check: 
SPOIL: S, P, O, I, L. None of these are in the excluded list? 
- S: not excluded
- P: not excluded
- O: not excluded
- I: not excluded
- L: not excluded

But actually, we have excluded C, R, A, N, E. So S,P,O,I,L are all available.

Alternatively, we could use ""TOILS"" or ""GHOUL"", but let's think of words that have more common letters.

Another word: ""BUOYS"" - B, U, O, Y, S. But B, U, O, Y, S are available. However, Y is sometimes a vowel, but it's allowed.

But perhaps we can choose a word with more common letters.

Word list possibilities: ""LIGHT"", ""MOIST"", ""BUOYS"", ""SPOIL"", etc.

We also don't want to include any excluded letters.

List of available letters: B,D,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,O,P,Q,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z

We want to cover vowels: O, I, U are available. Also Y can act as a vowel.

Common words:
- ""SPOIL"": letters S,P,O,I,L -> all available
- ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T -> available
- ""LIGHT"": L,I,G,H,T -> available
- ""DOUBT"": D,O,U,B,T -> available

But note: we want a word that doesn't repeat letters to maximize coverage.

I think ""SPOIL"" or ""MOIST"" are good choices.

Another classic one is ""ADIEU"" but A and E are excluded, so we cannot use that.

We could also try ""GHOUL"": G,H,O,U,L -> available.

But let me see frequency wise: S, T, L, and O are very common.

After excluding C,R,A,N,E, we can try a word with S, T, L, O, etc.

Word: ""SLOTH"" - S,L,O,T,H -> all available.

Another: ""TOUGH"" - T,O,U,G,H -> available.

But let's pick one that maximizes new letters.

We have 20 letters left, but we can only use five.

I recall that in Wordle, after eliminating some vowels, it's good to cover remaining vowels and common consonants.

Goal: find a word that uses I, O, U if possible? Not necessarily, but getting info about vowels is critical.

Vowels available: O, I, U. Also, sometimes Y.

We also need consonants.

So, let's choose a word that has two vowels and three consonants from the available letters.

For example: ""POINT"" -> P,O,I,N,T -> but N is excluded? Wait, guess1 feedback N was x, so N is excluded. So we cannot use ""POINT"" because N is excluded.

Similarly, we must avoid C,R,A,N,E.

So ""POINT"" has N -> excluded.

Similarly, ""QUERY"" has Q,U,E,R,Y -> but E and R are excluded -> invalid.

So avoiding the excluded letters.

Word: ""MOULD"" -> M,O,U,L,D -> all available? E is excluded, but O,U are vowels.

We can use ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T.
- M: available
- O: available
- I: available
- S: available
- T: available

Another option: ""SPOUT"" -> S,P,O,U,T -> O and U vowels.

But maybe ""MOIST"" is better because we cover O and I, which are common vowels.

Let's compare:
- ""MOIST"": M (less common? but used), O, I, S, T. S and T are very common consonants.
- ""SPOIL"": S,P,O,I,L. P and L are common too.

Another: ""BUILD"" -> B,U,I,L,D -> available.

But let's pick ""MOIST"" as a reasonable second guess.

We'll get feedback on M,O,I,S,T.

After this guess, we'll know if any of these are in the word and in which positions or not.

So, I'll go with ""moist"".Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, to maximize information gain, the next guess should avoid these letters entirely and introduce new common letters. ""MOIST"" uses five novel letters (M, O, I, S, T) that haven't been tested yet, including two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (M, S, T). This provides a broad coverage of high-frequency English letters and positions.

<guess>moist</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

1. Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So none of C,R,A,N,E are in the secret word.

2. Guess 2: ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), T(x)

This means:
- I is correct and in the third position (since I was in position 3 of ""moist"" and got a ✓). So the secret word has I as its third letter.
- S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since S was in position 4 and got a -). So S is present elsewhere in the word.
- M, O, and T are not in the word at all (all x).

Therefore, we now know:
- The third letter must be I.
- The word contains S, but not in the fourth position. Since the third position is I, S cannot be there. So S must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.
- Also, the word does not contain M, O, T (from the x's in guess 2) and already we know it doesn't contain C,R,A,N,E (from guess 1).

Excluded letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T

Included letters: S (somewhere, not in position 4) and definitely I in position 3.

We must form a 5-letter word with:
- Position 3: I
- S must be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (but not 3 or 4).

Also, the word cannot have any excluded letters.

Available letters: We can use any letters except: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T.

List of available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z
Available vowels: I,U (since I is already used, but can have another? But I is in position 3, and we can have another I? The feedback doesn't necessarily rule out multiple I's. However, in the previous guess, if there were two I's, we might have gotten a feedback for the other I? But in ""moist"", there's only one I. So we don't know if there are multiple I's. But typically, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters.

However, to be safe, we should consider the possibility of repeated letters.

But let's proceed.

We need to form a word that has:
- Third letter: I
- Contains S, in position 1, 2, or 5.
- No letters from the excluded set.

Possible words:

We can try to pick words that test new letters while incorporating the known I and S.

Since S must be placed in position 1, 2, or 5, we can consider each case separately? But we don't know yet.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has S in one of these positions and includes new letters for the other positions.

Available vowels: I and U (a is excluded, e excluded, o excluded). Also, Y can sometimes be used as a vowel.

We should consider words that use U as a vowel if possible.

What are possible examples?

Start with:

- Position 1: ? (any available letter)
- Position 2: ? 
- Position 3: I
- Position 4: ?
- Position 5: ?

With S being one of positions 1,2,5.

We also want to include new letters to get more information.

So, let's think of words with I in the third position and S present.

List of possible words:
- Possible: ... with pattern: _S_I_ ? But S must not be in position 4? And position 3 fixed.

Examples:

- S in position 1: Words like ""S?I??"": e.g., ""SKILL"", but K is available? But ""skill"" has double L? Also, ""skill"" has S in first position and I in third? Wait: S,K,I,L,L -> positions: S(1), K(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). But we know S must be present and in a wrong position? Actually, in guess 2, S was in position 4 and got a minus, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. In this word ""skill"" if S is in position 1, that's acceptable. But wait, we got a minus for S, meaning that S is in the word but not where we placed it (position 4). Then, in this new guess, placing S in position 1 would be okay.

But in ""skill"", we have S at position 1 and L at 4 and 5. But we don't know if L is in the word.

Similarly, other words: ""SPIKE"" -> but E is excluded.

""SPIKY"" -> I in third? S(1),P(2),I(3),K(4),Y(5). This uses P,K,Y which are available? And S in position 1.

Then, the word would have S in position 1? But in guess 2, S was marked as present but in wrong position (position 4). If we guess a word with S in position 1, then:
- If the actual word has S and its correct position is 1, we should get a check for S at position 1.
- If S's true position is somewhere else, then it might get a minus if we put it at 1 and it should be elsewhere.

Similarly, if we put S in position 2, etc.

We need to avoid S in position 4 because we know it's not there.

Another word: ""SWIFT"" -> S(1),W(2),I(3),F(4),T(5). But T is excluded? From guess 2, T got (x), so T is not in the word. So ""SWIFT"" has T -> invalid.

Similarly, cannot use T.

Another: We'll avoid T.

Possible words:

Option: Put S in position 5? Like __I_S

Words: ""ALIBS"" but A excluded.

""GUILD"" -> G,U,I,L,D -> I is in position 3. S is not present? We must include S because it's in the word. Our guess must contain S? No, not necessarily. Our guess doesn't have to contain S, but since we know S is in the word, if we don't include it, we might get an S x, but we already know S is present. However, to confirm its position, we can try to place S in another spot.

But ideally, we want to include S to verify where it goes.

Similarly, we can test other positions.

Since we have limited guesses, we should try to find the S location.

But we have letter constraints.

Let me list words with I in third position and S included.

Possible words:

- S in position 1: e.g., ""SPIKY"" (if Y allowed), or ""SHIP?"" ... but 5 letters.

5-letter words with pattern S?I??

- ""SKIMP"": S,K,I,M,P -> but M is excluded? Guess 2 said M(x). So M not in word.
- ""SKILL"": S,K,I,L,L -> K and L available? Yes. But we have double L? The word can have repeated letters? Possible.
- ""SKINT"": but N and T excluded.
- ""SKIRT"": R excluded.
- ""SHIFT"": F and T? T excluded.
- ""SHILL"": S,H,I,L,L -> H,L available? Yes.
- ""SHING"" not a word.
- ""SPILL"": S,P,I,L,L -> P and L available? Yes.

But S is placed in position 1.

Now, position 5: we can have S? If we put S in a new position.

But recall, in guess 2, S was placed in position 4 and got a minus. So if in secret S is also in position 4? No, the minus means S is not in position 4. So placement of S in position 1 might get check or minus.

Similarly, S in position 2: words like ?S?I?

- ""USING"": U,S,I,N,G -> N excluded? Guess 1, N(x).
- ""PSIGN"" not a word.
- ""BASIC"": B,A,S,I,C -> A and C excluded.

Not many.

S in position 5: pattern ???IS? No, ???I_? with S at the end? So pattern __I_S

Words:
- ""TWINS"" but T excluded.
- ""GUILS"" not a word? ""GUILD"" no S.
- ""FLAIS"" not a word.
- ""POLIS"" O excluded? Guess 2 O(x).
- ""VALID"" A excluded.
- ""BLIPS"" but L,I,P,S: B,L,I,P,S -> positions: B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). I is at position 3? Yes.

""BLIPS"" -> B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). Now, S is in position 5. Also, avoid excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> B,L,P,S,I: are these excluded? B not excluded, L not, P not, I not excluded (but we know I is in word?), S not excluded.

In the secret word, we know I is at position 3 and S is present (somewhere else). So ""BLIPS"" has I at position 3 and S at position 5. We don't know about B,L,P.

Also, S is placed at position 5: if S is at position 5 in the secret, we get a check; if S is somewhere else (like position 1 or 2) then putting it at 5 would get a minus? Because it would be wrong position.

Similarly, if S is at position 5, we get ✓ for S.

Now, other words: ""KLUTZ"" but K,L,U,T,Z -> T excluded.

Another: ""JUICE"" E excluded.

""QUIPS"" -> Q,U,I,P,S -> positions: Q(1),U(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). Q,U,P,S available? Yes.

But Q is less common.

""KLUIS"" not standard.

Also, note that in ""moist"", position 4 got S(-), meaning S is present elsewhere. So it could be at position 1,2 or 5.

Now, with available letters, let me choose a word that includes S and I at position 3, and tests new letters.

One good word might be ""PULIS"" but that's not standard; usually ""PULIS"" is not recognized. Or ""DOUOS"" no.

Standard words: ""SUSHI"" -> S,U,S,H,I -> positions: S(1),U(2),S(3),H(4),I(5). I is at position 5? But we need I at position 3. So not.

""SPIKE"" E excluded.

""SHILY"" -> S,H,I,L,Y -> positions: S(1),H(2),I(3),L(4),Y(5). This seems valid: S at 1, I at 3.

Letters: S,H,L,Y available and not excluded.

Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> H,L,Y available? Yes.

But in this word:
- Position 1: S -> if S is at position 1 in secret, we get ✓; otherwise -
- Position 3: I ✓ (we know that)
- Position 4: L -> this is a new letter, so if L is at position 4 in secret, we get information.
- Position 5: Y -> new letter.

Position 2: H -> new.

But if we place S at position 1 and it turns out S is not at 1, we might get - or x? Since S is present, if not at position 1, it would get a minus because it exists elsewhere. But we already know S is in the word, so if S is at position 1 and correct, it will be ✓; if S is at position 2 or 5 in secret, then placing S at position 1 would get a minus (wrong position).

Similarly for ""BLIPS"" etc.

Another word: ""BLISS"" -> B,L,I,S,S. Double S? But I at position 3? B(1),L(2),I(3),S(4),S(5). But position 4: S, but in guess 2 S was at position 4 and got a minus, meaning S is not at position 4. Placing S again at position 4 would likely also get a minus? But if the word has S only once, then putting S at position 4 might get x if S is not present, but we know S is present. So the feedback for position 4 would be - or ✓? It would depend.

Actually, since we know S is in the word, and we're testing position 4 again? But initially, we were told S is not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4 again, it will still get a minus because the correct position is elsewhere. And we might not learn anything new.

In fact, if S is not at position 4, putting S anywhere else that's not the correct position would get a minus. Only if we put it in the correct position we get ✓.

Therefore, to test position 1,2 or 5 for S, we can place S there and see if we get ✓.

In this guess, we can put S in position 1, for example, to see if it's correct.

Similarly, position 2 or 5.

Also, we need to avoid position 4.

Given the letters available, let's find common words.

Possible word with S in position 1: ""SHINY"" but H,I,N,Y: N excluded? Yes, guess 1 N(x).

Not.

""SHILY"": S,H,I,L,Y -> H(2), L(4), Y(5). Available letters? H,L,Y available.

Can we use ""shily""? Meaning: in a shy manner? It's a valid word.

Similarly, alternatives: ""SKILLY"" too many letters? No.

""SLILY"" S,L,I,L,Y: S(1),L(2),I(3),L(4),Y(5). Double L? Possible.

""SLIMY"" but M excluded.

So ""SHILY"" seems decent.

With S at position 1: if the secret word has S at position 1, we get ✓ for S; if S is at position 2, we get - for S (since it's present but wrong position if placed at 1); similarly for position 5? No: placing S at 1, if S should be at 5, then S at position 1 is wrong position, so minus.

Therefore, by placing S at position 1, we can distinguish between S being at position 1 or elsewhere (minus means S must be at position 2 or 5).

Similarly, we get info about H,L,Y.

But Y may be less common; we could test more common consonants.

Another option: Put S in position 2.

For example, ""PSYCH"" too long.

""PSION"" P,S,I,O,N -> O excluded, N excluded.

Not.

""USUAL"" U,S,U,A,L -> A excluded and double U.

Not.

""EXPEL"" E and X? E excluded.

Not.

Put S in position 5: pattern ???IS

Words: 
- ""BITES"" E excluded.
- ""WILLIS"" too long.
- ""PENIS"" E excluded? And P,E,N,I,S: E and N excluded.
- ""LUPUS"" L,U,P,U,S -> double U. U is available, but double U? Uncommon.
- ""FOCUS"" O excluded.
- ""GENUS"" E and G? E excluded.

Perhaps ""BLISS"" as mentioned earlier? But S in position 4 and 5? And position 4 S would get minus again? Avoid position 4.

So words with S at position 5 and no S elsewhere? And I at position 3.

Pattern: ??I?S

Examples:
- ""HUMUS"" H,U,M,U,S -> M excluded.
- ""TIBBS"" T excluded.
- ""DILLS"" D,I,L,L,S -> I at position 2? No, position 3 needed. ??I?S: so letter 3 must be I? So D?I?S? ""DILIS""? Not a word.

Words like: with letters 1,2,4 available and 5=S.

So for example: _ _ I _ S

What words? ""AXIIS"" not, A excluded.

""KILPS"" K,I,L,P,S -> positions: K(1),I(2)? No, I must be at 3.

So it must be letter 3 is I, so pattern: first letter: ?, second letter: ?, third: I, fourth: ?, fifth: S.

Words: ""POINT"" O excluded.
""QUAIS"" Q,U,A,I,S -> A excluded.
""GUILS"" G,U,I,L,S -> positions: G(1),U(2),I(3),L(4),S(5). Yes, L at position 4.

S at position 5. Avoid S at position 4, which we do.

Letters: G,U,I,L,S. But I and S already known? G,U,L new.

Excluded letters? C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T — G,U,L are available.

""GUILS"" is a word? ""Guils"" might be plural of ""guil"" — not standard. ""GUIL"" is not a common word. Better to go with ""GUILD"" but D available? ""GUILD"" has no S.

Is there a word ""GUI LS""? No.

Another: ""BUILT"" U,I,L,T -> T excluded? Guess 2 T(x), cannot.

""FLUID"" F,L,U,I,D -> I at position 4? F(1),L(2),U(3),I(4),D(5). But need I at position 3. Not.

So the word must have I at position 3.

Common word: ""BLIPS"" again? B,L,I,P,S -> S at 5? B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). Or ""QUIPS"" Q,U,I,P,S.

But BLIPS: B,L,I,P,S

We can use ""BLIPS"" even though P is less common.

Perhaps ""SHIPS"" -> S,H,I,P,S -> double S? And S at position 1 and 5? But we have S at position 1? Let's see: S(1),H(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). But position 4: P? And S also at 5.

But position 4: P. We could get feedback for P.

Drawback: S appears twice? But in the secret word, we know S is at least once. Could there be two S?

We don't know.

But ""SHIPS"" has S at position 1 and 5. If we guess, position 1 S: if S is at position 1, we get ✓; else -? But if S is also at position 5, and we have S at position 5, if that's correct, we get ✓ for it.

But this might complicate.

Perhaps choose a word without repeated letters to simplify.

Back to ""SHILY"": S,H,I,L,Y -> all distinct letters: S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.

This seems reasonable.

Another word: ""WHISK"" W,H,I,S,K -> positions: W(1),H(2),I(3),S(4),K(5). But position 4: S? We were told S is not in position 4? In ""moist"" we guessed S at position 4 and got minus, meaning S is not at position 4. Therefore, in this guess, if we put S at position 4 again, it will also get minus (or if there are two S, it might be different, but risky). So better to avoid position 4 for S.

So ""WHISK"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.

Therefore, ""SHILY"" with S at position 1, or ""GUILS"" if we assume it's valid? No, ""GUILS"" is not standard.

Standard words: ""SHULS"" S,H,U,L,S? Double S and structure.

Perhaps ""DAISY"" D,A,I,S,Y -> A excluded.

""FUSIL"": F,U,S,I,L -> positions: F(1),U(2),S(3),I(4),L(5). But I is at position 4, not 3? Need I at position 3.

Not.

""USUAL"" has no I.

I think ""SHILY"" or ""BLIPS"" or ""QUIPS"" are options.

""BLIPS"" seems valid: B,L,I,P,S -> positions: B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5)

S is at position 5.

Similarly, ""PULIS"" not good.

Another word: ""GLIBS"" -> G,L,I,B,S? G(1),L(2),I(3),B(4),S(5)

Or ""SPIVS"" -> S at 1, but double S at end? And P,I,V,S — V available.

But V uncommon.

Perhaps ""SHILY"" is better.

Or, to include U? ""QUIPS"" Q,U,I,P,S -> Q(1),U(2),I(3),P(4),S(5)

Using Q is very rare; so not ideal for information gain.

Therefore, I'll go with ""BLIPS"" or ""SHILY"".

Let's choose ""SHILY"".

Or ""BLISS"" but avoid position 4 S.

How about ""SWISH""? S at 1 and 5? S(1),W(2),I(3),S(4),H(5). Again S at position 4 -> avoid.

Position 4 we should avoid for S? Only if we suspect S might be there, we know it's not. So if we put S at position 4, we get a minus, which is expected, so we don't test new position.

So we should avoid position 4 for S in this guess? To potentially find S's position.

Thus, words with S at position 1,2, or 5.

Another word: S in position 2, like ""FSILS"" not word.

""ASIDE"" A excluded.

I think ""SHILY"" is a good choice.

Meaning of ""SHILY"": adverb, shyly? Sometimes spelled ""shily"".

In Wordle, it might be accepted.

To be safe, ""BLIPS"" is a valid word meaning something.

I'll choose ""BLIPS"".

But you have to test position 4 with P.

Either is fine.

Since we have position 3 fixed, and S must be placed, and feedback will give info on the position of S.

For example, with ""SHILY"":

- If S is at position 1, S in guess should be ✓.
- If S is at position 2 or 5, S in position 1 should be - (since present but wrong position).

Similarly for other placements.

Also, L at position 4: if the secret word has L at position 4, we get a new ✓; if L is present elsewhere, we get -; if not, x.

But we don't know about L.

Similarly, Y at position 5: same.

But Y is less common; so maybe ""BLIPS"" with more common letters? B,L,I,P,S — P is less common than Y? Perhaps.

Another word: ""SLICK"" but C excluded? C is excluded.

""SLIVY"" not a word.

""SHIPS"" — but has S at position 1 and P at 4? Position 4: P. Then S at 1 and at 5? ""SHIPS"" is S,H,I,P,S — but 5-letter are positions: S(1),H(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). So it has two S.

But that's acceptable if we allow double L.

But in terms of feedback, if we put P at position 4, we get information about P.

Similarly, for the second S at 5? But if S is only one, then S at position 5 might be x or -, but if the secret has two S, etc.

Complicated.

Stick with distinct letters: ""SHILY"" or ""BLIPS"".

I'll go with ""SHILY"".

But ""SHILY"" contains Y which can be both vowel and consonant, but should be fine.

Perhaps ""BUILD"" but no S.

Not.

Decision: guess ""SHILY"".

After feedback we'll know more.

So:

<guess>shily</guess>Based on the feedback from previous guesses:
- No letters from ""CRANE"" (C, R, A, N, E) are in the secret word.
- None of M, O, T are in the secret word.
- The third letter is I (✓ from ""moist"").
- S is in the word but not in position 4 (- from ""moist"").

Therefore, for the next guess:
- Must have I in position 3.
- Must include S in position 1, 2, or 5 (since position 4 is invalid).
- Must avoid letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T.
- Aim to test new common letters (e.g., B, D, F, G, H, L, P, U, etc.).

""SHILY"" was chosen because:
- It places S in position 1 to test if S belongs at position 1 (✓ or - feedback).
- It has I in position 3 (known to be correct).
- It introduces new letters: H (position 2), L (position 4), Y (position 5), all of which are available and common.
- It uses distinct letters to maximize information.

Also Y can act as a vowel.\n\nCommon words:\n- ""SPOIL"": letters S,P,O,I,L -> all available\n- ""MOIST"": M,O,I,S,T -> available\n- ""LIGHT"": L,I,G,H,T -> available\n- ""DOUBT"": D,O,U,B,T -> available\n\nBut note: we want a word that doesn\'t repeat letters to maximize coverage.\n\nI think ""SPOIL"" or ""MOIST"" are good choices.\n\nAnother classic one is ""ADIEU"" but A and E are excluded, so we cannot use that.\n\nWe could also try ""GHOUL"": G,H,O,U,L -> available.\n\nBut let me see frequency wise: S, T, L, and O are very common.\n\nAfter excluding C,R,A,N,E, we can try a word with S, T, L, O, etc.\n\nWord: ""SLOTH"" - S,L,O,T,H -> all available.\n\nAnother: ""TOUGH"" - T,O,U,G,H -> available.\n\nBut let\'s pick one that maximizes new letters.\n\nWe have 20 letters left, but we can only use five.\n\nI recall that in Wordle, after eliminating some vowels, it\'s good to cover remaining vowels and common consonants.\n\nGoal: find a word that uses I, O, U if possible? Not necessarily, but getting info about vowels is critical.\n\nVowels available: O, I, U. Also, sometimes Y.\n\nWe also need consonants.\n\nSo, let\'s choose a word that has two vowels and three consonants from the available letters.\n\nFor example: ""POINT"" -> P,O,I,N,T -> but N is excluded? Wait, guess1 feedback N was x, so N is excluded. So we cannot use ""POINT"" because N is excluded.\n\nSimilarly, we must avoid C,R,A,N,E.\n\nSo ""POINT"" has N -> excluded.\n\nSimilarly, ""QUERY"" has Q,U,E,R,Y -> but E and R are excluded -> invalid.\n\nSo avoiding the excluded letters.\n\nWord: ""MOULD"" -> M,O,U,L,D -> all available? E is excluded, but O,U are vowels.\n\nWe can use ""MOIST"": M, O, I, S, T.\n- M: available\n- O: available\n- I: available\n- S: available\n- T: available\n\nAnother option: ""SPOUT"" -> S,P,O,U,T -> O and U vowels.\n\nBut maybe ""MOIST"" is better because we cover O and I, which are common vowels.\n\nLet\'s compare:\n- ""MOIST"": M (less common? but used), O, I, S, T. S and T are very common consonants.\n- ""SPOIL"": S,P,O,I,L. P and L are common too.\n\nAnother: ""BUILD"" -> B,U,I,L,D -> available.\n\nBut let\'s pick ""MOIST"" as a reasonable second guess.\n\nWe\'ll get feedback on M,O,I,S,T.\n\nAfter this guess, we\'ll know if any of these are in the word and in which positions or not.\n\nSo, I\'ll go with ""moist"".Based on the previous feedback, none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word. Therefore, to maximize information gain, the next guess should avoid these letters entirely and introduce new common letters. ""MOIST"" uses five novel letters (M, O, I, S, T) that haven\'t been tested yet, including two vowels (O and I) and three consonants (M, S, T). This provides a broad coverage of high-frequency English letters and positions.\n\n<guess>moist</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: moist -> FEEDBACK: M(x) O(x) I(✓) S(-) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\n1. Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters incorrect: C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x). So none of C,R,A,N,E are in the secret word.\n\n2. Guess 2: ""moist"" -> Feedback: M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), T(x)\n\nThis means:\n- I is correct and in the third position (since I was in position 3 of ""moist"" and got a ✓). So the secret word has I as its third letter.\n- S is in the word but not in the fourth position (since S was in position 4 and got a -). So S is present elsewhere in the word.\n- M, O, and T are not in the word at all (all x).\n\nTherefore, we now know:\n- The third letter must be I.\n- The word contains S, but not in the fourth position. Since the third position is I, S cannot be there. So S must be in one of positions 1, 2, or 5.\n- Also, the word does not contain M, O, T (from the x\'s in guess 2) and already we know it doesn\'t contain C,R,A,N,E (from guess 1).\n\nExcluded letters so far: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T\n\nIncluded letters: S (somewhere, not in position 4) and definitely I in position 3.\n\nWe must form a 5-letter word with:\n- Position 3: I\n- S must be in positions 1, 2, or 5 (but not 3 or 4).\n\nAlso, the word cannot have any excluded letters.\n\nAvailable letters: We can use any letters except: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T.\n\nList of available consonants: B,D,F,G,H,J,K,L,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\nAvailable vowels: I,U (since I is already used, but can have another? But I is in position 3, and we can have another I? The feedback doesn\'t necessarily rule out multiple I\'s. However, in the previous guess, if there were two I\'s, we might have gotten a feedback for the other I? But in ""moist"", there\'s only one I. So we don\'t know if there are multiple I\'s. But typically, in Wordle, words can have repeated letters.\n\nHowever, to be safe, we should consider the possibility of repeated letters.\n\nBut let\'s proceed.\n\nWe need to form a word that has:\n- Third letter: I\n- Contains S, in position 1, 2, or 5.\n- No letters from the excluded set.\n\nPossible words:\n\nWe can try to pick words that test new letters while incorporating the known I and S.\n\nSince S must be placed in position 1, 2, or 5, we can consider each case separately? But we don\'t know yet.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that has S in one of these positions and includes new letters for the other positions.\n\nAvailable vowels: I and U (a is excluded, e excluded, o excluded). Also, Y can sometimes be used as a vowel.\n\nWe should consider words that use U as a vowel if possible.\n\nWhat are possible examples?\n\nStart with:\n\n- Position 1: ? (any available letter)\n- Position 2: ? \n- Position 3: I\n- Position 4: ?\n- Position 5: ?\n\nWith S being one of positions 1,2,5.\n\nWe also want to include new letters to get more information.\n\nSo, let\'s think of words with I in the third position and S present.\n\nList of possible words:\n- Possible: ... with pattern: _S_I_ ? But S must not be in position 4? And position 3 fixed.\n\nExamples:\n\n- S in position 1: Words like ""S?I??"": e.g., ""SKILL"", but K is available? But ""skill"" has double L? Also, ""skill"" has S in first position and I in third? Wait: S,K,I,L,L -> positions: S(1), K(2), I(3), L(4), L(5). But we know S must be present and in a wrong position? Actually, in guess 2, S was in position 4 and got a minus, meaning S is in the word but not in position 4. In this word ""skill"" if S is in position 1, that\'s acceptable. But wait, we got a minus for S, meaning that S is in the word but not where we placed it (position 4). Then, in this new guess, placing S in position 1 would be okay.\n\nBut in ""skill"", we have S at position 1 and L at 4 and 5. But we don\'t know if L is in the word.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""SPIKE"" -> but E is excluded.\n\n""SPIKY"" -> I in third? S(1),P(2),I(3),K(4),Y(5). This uses P,K,Y which are available? And S in position 1.\n\nThen, the word would have S in position 1? But in guess 2, S was marked as present but in wrong position (position 4). If we guess a word with S in position 1, then:\n- If the actual word has S and its correct position is 1, we should get a check for S at position 1.\n- If S\'s true position is somewhere else, then it might get a minus if we put it at 1 and it should be elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, if we put S in position 2, etc.\n\nWe need to avoid S in position 4 because we know it\'s not there.\n\nAnother word: ""SWIFT"" -> S(1),W(2),I(3),F(4),T(5). But T is excluded? From guess 2, T got (x), so T is not in the word. So ""SWIFT"" has T -> invalid.\n\nSimilarly, cannot use T.\n\nAnother: We\'ll avoid T.\n\nPossible words:\n\nOption: Put S in position 5? Like __I_S\n\nWords: ""ALIBS"" but A excluded.\n\n""GUILD"" -> G,U,I,L,D -> I is in position 3. S is not present? We must include S because it\'s in the word. Our guess must contain S? No, not necessarily. Our guess doesn\'t have to contain S, but since we know S is in the word, if we don\'t include it, we might get an S x, but we already know S is present. However, to confirm its position, we can try to place S in another spot.\n\nBut ideally, we want to include S to verify where it goes.\n\nSimilarly, we can test other positions.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we should try to find the S location.\n\nBut we have letter constraints.\n\nLet me list words with I in third position and S included.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- S in position 1: e.g., ""SPIKY"" (if Y allowed), or ""SHIP?"" ... but 5 letters.\n\n5-letter words with pattern S?I??\n\n- ""SKIMP"": S,K,I,M,P -> but M is excluded? Guess 2 said M(x). So M not in word.\n- ""SKILL"": S,K,I,L,L -> K and L available? Yes. But we have double L? The word can have repeated letters? Possible.\n- ""SKINT"": but N and T excluded.\n- ""SKIRT"": R excluded.\n- ""SHIFT"": F and T? T excluded.\n- ""SHILL"": S,H,I,L,L -> H,L available? Yes.\n- ""SHING"" not a word.\n- ""SPILL"": S,P,I,L,L -> P and L available? Yes.\n\nBut S is placed in position 1.\n\nNow, position 5: we can have S? If we put S in a new position.\n\nBut recall, in guess 2, S was placed in position 4 and got a minus. So if in secret S is also in position 4? No, the minus means S is not in position 4. So placement of S in position 1 might get check or minus.\n\nSimilarly, S in position 2: words like ?S?I?\n\n- ""USING"": U,S,I,N,G -> N excluded? Guess 1, N(x).\n- ""PSIGN"" not a word.\n- ""BASIC"": B,A,S,I,C -> A and C excluded.\n\nNot many.\n\nS in position 5: pattern ???IS? No, ???I_? with S at the end? So pattern __I_S\n\nWords:\n- ""TWINS"" but T excluded.\n- ""GUILS"" not a word? ""GUILD"" no S.\n- ""FLAIS"" not a word.\n- ""POLIS"" O excluded? Guess 2 O(x).\n- ""VALID"" A excluded.\n- ""BLIPS"" but L,I,P,S: B,L,I,P,S -> positions: B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). I is at position 3? Yes.\n\n""BLIPS"" -> B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). Now, S is in position 5. Also, avoid excluded letters? Excluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> B,L,P,S,I: are these excluded? B not excluded, L not, P not, I not excluded (but we know I is in word?), S not excluded.\n\nIn the secret word, we know I is at position 3 and S is present (somewhere else). So ""BLIPS"" has I at position 3 and S at position 5. We don\'t know about B,L,P.\n\nAlso, S is placed at position 5: if S is at position 5 in the secret, we get a check; if S is somewhere else (like position 1 or 2) then putting it at 5 would get a minus? Because it would be wrong position.\n\nSimilarly, if S is at position 5, we get ✓ for S.\n\nNow, other words: ""KLUTZ"" but K,L,U,T,Z -> T excluded.\n\nAnother: ""JUICE"" E excluded.\n\n""QUIPS"" -> Q,U,I,P,S -> positions: Q(1),U(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). Q,U,P,S available? Yes.\n\nBut Q is less common.\n\n""KLUIS"" not standard.\n\nAlso, note that in ""moist"", position 4 got S(-), meaning S is present elsewhere. So it could be at position 1,2 or 5.\n\nNow, with available letters, let me choose a word that includes S and I at position 3, and tests new letters.\n\nOne good word might be ""PULIS"" but that\'s not standard; usually ""PULIS"" is not recognized. Or ""DOUOS"" no.\n\nStandard words: ""SUSHI"" -> S,U,S,H,I -> positions: S(1),U(2),S(3),H(4),I(5). I is at position 5? But we need I at position 3. So not.\n\n""SPIKE"" E excluded.\n\n""SHILY"" -> S,H,I,L,Y -> positions: S(1),H(2),I(3),L(4),Y(5). This seems valid: S at 1, I at 3.\n\nLetters: S,H,L,Y available and not excluded.\n\nExcluded: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T -> H,L,Y available? Yes.\n\nBut in this word:\n- Position 1: S -> if S is at position 1 in secret, we get ✓; otherwise -\n- Position 3: I ✓ (we know that)\n- Position 4: L -> this is a new letter, so if L is at position 4 in secret, we get information.\n- Position 5: Y -> new letter.\n\nPosition 2: H -> new.\n\nBut if we place S at position 1 and it turns out S is not at 1, we might get - or x? Since S is present, if not at position 1, it would get a minus because it exists elsewhere. But we already know S is in the word, so if S is at position 1 and correct, it will be ✓; if S is at position 2 or 5 in secret, then placing S at position 1 would get a minus (wrong position).\n\nSimilarly for ""BLIPS"" etc.\n\nAnother word: ""BLISS"" -> B,L,I,S,S. Double S? But I at position 3? B(1),L(2),I(3),S(4),S(5). But position 4: S, but in guess 2 S was at position 4 and got a minus, meaning S is not at position 4. Placing S again at position 4 would likely also get a minus? But if the word has S only once, then putting S at position 4 might get x if S is not present, but we know S is present. So the feedback for position 4 would be - or ✓? It would depend.\n\nActually, since we know S is in the word, and we\'re testing position 4 again? But initially, we were told S is not in position 4. So if we put S in position 4 again, it will still get a minus because the correct position is elsewhere. And we might not learn anything new.\n\nIn fact, if S is not at position 4, putting S anywhere else that\'s not the correct position would get a minus. Only if we put it in the correct position we get ✓.\n\nTherefore, to test position 1,2 or 5 for S, we can place S there and see if we get ✓.\n\nIn this guess, we can put S in position 1, for example, to see if it\'s correct.\n\nSimilarly, position 2 or 5.\n\nAlso, we need to avoid position 4.\n\nGiven the letters available, let\'s find common words.\n\nPossible word with S in position 1: ""SHINY"" but H,I,N,Y: N excluded? Yes, guess 1 N(x).\n\nNot.\n\n""SHILY"": S,H,I,L,Y -> H(2), L(4), Y(5). Available letters? H,L,Y available.\n\nCan we use ""shily""? Meaning: in a shy manner? It\'s a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, alternatives: ""SKILLY"" too many letters? No.\n\n""SLILY"" S,L,I,L,Y: S(1),L(2),I(3),L(4),Y(5). Double L? Possible.\n\n""SLIMY"" but M excluded.\n\nSo ""SHILY"" seems decent.\n\nWith S at position 1: if the secret word has S at position 1, we get ✓ for S; if S is at position 2, we get - for S (since it\'s present but wrong position if placed at 1); similarly for position 5? No: placing S at 1, if S should be at 5, then S at position 1 is wrong position, so minus.\n\nTherefore, by placing S at position 1, we can distinguish between S being at position 1 or elsewhere (minus means S must be at position 2 or 5).\n\nSimilarly, we get info about H,L,Y.\n\nBut Y may be less common; we could test more common consonants.\n\nAnother option: Put S in position 2.\n\nFor example, ""PSYCH"" too long.\n\n""PSION"" P,S,I,O,N -> O excluded, N excluded.\n\nNot.\n\n""USUAL"" U,S,U,A,L -> A excluded and double U.\n\nNot.\n\n""EXPEL"" E and X? E excluded.\n\nNot.\n\nPut S in position 5: pattern ???IS\n\nWords: \n- ""BITES"" E excluded.\n- ""WILLIS"" too long.\n- ""PENIS"" E excluded? And P,E,N,I,S: E and N excluded.\n- ""LUPUS"" L,U,P,U,S -> double U. U is available, but double U? Uncommon.\n- ""FOCUS"" O excluded.\n- ""GENUS"" E and G? E excluded.\n\nPerhaps ""BLISS"" as mentioned earlier? But S in position 4 and 5? And position 4 S would get minus again? Avoid position 4.\n\nSo words with S at position 5 and no S elsewhere? And I at position 3.\n\nPattern: ??I?S\n\nExamples:\n- ""HUMUS"" H,U,M,U,S -> M excluded.\n- ""TIBBS"" T excluded.\n- ""DILLS"" D,I,L,L,S -> I at position 2? No, position 3 needed. ??I?S: so letter 3 must be I? So D?I?S? ""DILIS""? Not a word.\n\nWords like: with letters 1,2,4 available and 5=S.\n\nSo for example: _ _ I _ S\n\nWhat words? ""AXIIS"" not, A excluded.\n\n""KILPS"" K,I,L,P,S -> positions: K(1),I(2)? No, I must be at 3.\n\nSo it must be letter 3 is I, so pattern: first letter: ?, second letter: ?, third: I, fourth: ?, fifth: S.\n\nWords: ""POINT"" O excluded.\n""QUAIS"" Q,U,A,I,S -> A excluded.\n""GUILS"" G,U,I,L,S -> positions: G(1),U(2),I(3),L(4),S(5). Yes, L at position 4.\n\nS at position 5. Avoid S at position 4, which we do.\n\nLetters: G,U,I,L,S. But I and S already known? G,U,L new.\n\nExcluded letters? C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T — G,U,L are available.\n\n""GUILS"" is a word? ""Guils"" might be plural of ""guil"" — not standard. ""GUIL"" is not a common word. Better to go with ""GUILD"" but D available? ""GUILD"" has no S.\n\nIs there a word ""GUI LS""? No.\n\nAnother: ""BUILT"" U,I,L,T -> T excluded? Guess 2 T(x), cannot.\n\n""FLUID"" F,L,U,I,D -> I at position 4? F(1),L(2),U(3),I(4),D(5). But need I at position 3. Not.\n\nSo the word must have I at position 3.\n\nCommon word: ""BLIPS"" again? B,L,I,P,S -> S at 5? B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). Or ""QUIPS"" Q,U,I,P,S.\n\nBut BLIPS: B,L,I,P,S\n\nWe can use ""BLIPS"" even though P is less common.\n\nPerhaps ""SHIPS"" -> S,H,I,P,S -> double S? And S at position 1 and 5? But we have S at position 1? Let\'s see: S(1),H(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). But position 4: P? And S also at 5.\n\nBut position 4: P. We could get feedback for P.\n\nDrawback: S appears twice? But in the secret word, we know S is at least once. Could there be two S?\n\nWe don\'t know.\n\nBut ""SHIPS"" has S at position 1 and 5. If we guess, position 1 S: if S is at position 1, we get ✓; else -? But if S is also at position 5, and we have S at position 5, if that\'s correct, we get ✓ for it.\n\nBut this might complicate.\n\nPerhaps choose a word without repeated letters to simplify.\n\nBack to ""SHILY"": S,H,I,L,Y -> all distinct letters: S at 1, H at 2, I at 3, L at 4, Y at 5.\n\nThis seems reasonable.\n\nAnother word: ""WHISK"" W,H,I,S,K -> positions: W(1),H(2),I(3),S(4),K(5). But position 4: S? We were told S is not in position 4? In ""moist"" we guessed S at position 4 and got minus, meaning S is not at position 4. Therefore, in this guess, if we put S at position 4 again, it will also get minus (or if there are two S, it might be different, but risky). So better to avoid position 4 for S.\n\nSo ""WHISK"" has S at position 4 -> avoid.\n\nTherefore, ""SHILY"" with S at position 1, or ""GUILS"" if we assume it\'s valid? No, ""GUILS"" is not standard.\n\nStandard words: ""SHULS"" S,H,U,L,S? Double S and structure.\n\nPerhaps ""DAISY"" D,A,I,S,Y -> A excluded.\n\n""FUSIL"": F,U,S,I,L -> positions: F(1),U(2),S(3),I(4),L(5). But I is at position 4, not 3? Need I at position 3.\n\nNot.\n\n""USUAL"" has no I.\n\nI think ""SHILY"" or ""BLIPS"" or ""QUIPS"" are options.\n\n""BLIPS"" seems valid: B,L,I,P,S -> positions: B(1),L(2),I(3),P(4),S(5)\n\nS is at position 5.\n\nSimilarly, ""PULIS"" not good.\n\nAnother word: ""GLIBS"" -> G,L,I,B,S? G(1),L(2),I(3),B(4),S(5)\n\nOr ""SPIVS"" -> S at 1, but double S at end? And P,I,V,S — V available.\n\nBut V uncommon.\n\nPerhaps ""SHILY"" is better.\n\nOr, to include U? ""QUIPS"" Q,U,I,P,S -> Q(1),U(2),I(3),P(4),S(5)\n\nUsing Q is very rare; so not ideal for information gain.\n\nTherefore, I\'ll go with ""BLIPS"" or ""SHILY"".\n\nLet\'s choose ""SHILY"".\n\nOr ""BLISS"" but avoid position 4 S.\n\nHow about ""SWISH""? S at 1 and 5? S(1),W(2),I(3),S(4),H(5). Again S at position 4 -> avoid.\n\nPosition 4 we should avoid for S? Only if we suspect S might be there, we know it\'s not. So if we put S at position 4, we get a minus, which is expected, so we don\'t test new position.\n\nSo we should avoid position 4 for S in this guess? To potentially find S\'s position.\n\nThus, words with S at position 1,2, or 5.\n\nAnother word: S in position 2, like ""FSILS"" not word.\n\n""ASIDE"" A excluded.\n\nI think ""SHILY"" is a good choice.\n\nMeaning of ""SHILY"": adverb, shyly? Sometimes spelled ""shily"".\n\nIn Wordle, it might be accepted.\n\nTo be safe, ""BLIPS"" is a valid word meaning something.\n\nI\'ll choose ""BLIPS"".\n\nBut you have to test position 4 with P.\n\nEither is fine.\n\nSince we have position 3 fixed, and S must be placed, and feedback will give info on the position of S.\n\nFor example, with ""SHILY"":\n\n- If S is at position 1, S in guess should be ✓.\n- If S is at position 2 or 5, S in position 1 should be - (since present but wrong position).\n\nSimilarly for other placements.\n\nAlso, L at position 4: if the secret word has L at position 4, we get a new ✓; if L is present elsewhere, we get -; if not, x.\n\nBut we don\'t know about L.\n\nSimilarly, Y at position 5: same.\n\nBut Y is less common; so maybe ""BLIPS"" with more common letters? B,L,I,P,S — P is less common than Y? Perhaps.\n\nAnother word: ""SLICK"" but C excluded? C is excluded.\n\n""SLIVY"" not a word.\n\n""SHIPS"" — but has S at position 1 and P at 4? Position 4: P. Then S at 1 and at 5? ""SHIPS"" is S,H,I,P,S — but 5-letter are positions: S(1),H(2),I(3),P(4),S(5). So it has two S.\n\nBut that\'s acceptable if we allow double L.\n\nBut in terms of feedback, if we put P at position 4, we get information about P.\n\nSimilarly, for the second S at 5?

Guess 1: ""crane"" gave C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → So letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.

Guess 2: ""moist"" gave M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), T(x) → Therefore:
- I is in the word and in position 3 (that's the only I in the guess, so it must be the correct letter and position).
- S is in the word, but not in position 4. Since I is at position 3, S cannot be at position 3 either. So S must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- M, O, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""shily"" gave S(✓), H(x), I(✓), L(✓), Y(x) → Therefore:
- S is in position 1 and correct (✓). So the first letter of the secret word is S.
- I is in position 3 and correct (we already knew this).
- L is in position 4 and correct (✓). So the fourth letter is L.
- H and Y are not in the word (x).

We also know that the third letter is I and fourth is L. So the word is S _ I L _.

From the feedback of guess 2, S is in the word and not in position 4, and now we know it's in position 1. Also, the ✓ for S in position 1 confirms that.

Now, missing positions: position 2 and position 5.

We know the secret word has the pattern: S ? I L ?

We have also excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T, H, Y.

And from the feedback, no other information except the positions.

Now, letters that are in the word: S, I, L. And they are fixed in positions: S(1), I(3), L(4).

We need to find the letter for position 2 and position 5.

Also, note that from the previous feedback, all excluded letters are not in the word. So our available letters are: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z and vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are either excluded or used; I is used but we could have another I? But position 3 is I, so position 2 or 5 could be I? Possible repeated letters? However, in guess 3, we guessed S,H,I,L,Y. The I was at position 3 and got ✓, which only confirms that position. But if there were another I in the word, it wasn't tested because we didn't put it in the guess. Similarly, with L.

So we cannot rule out repeated letters? But let's see.

We have to form a word: S ? I L ?

Now, possible words:

- The fifth letter could be the same as one of the existing? Or different.

Common English words: SILKY? But K and Y: Y is excluded? From guess 3, Y(x). Cannot be.

SILLY? S,I,L,L,Y. But Y excluded and L repeated? Pattern: S(1), I(2), L(3), L(4), ? But we have I at position 3? So S(1), ?(2), I(3), L(4), ?(5). So ""SILLY"" does not fit because I is at position 2, not 3.

Similarly, ""SKILL"" — S(1),K(2),I(3),L(4),L(5). Pattern fits? S(1), K(2), I(3), L(4), ? ; but L is only at position 4? Then fifth letter? In ""SKILL"", it ends with double L? So S(1),K(2),I(3),L(4),L(5). So L is repeated? And position 4 and 5 are both L? But we have position 4 is L but position 5 might be different.

In our pattern: position 4 is L, so in ""SKILL"", after I at position 3, then L at position 4? And L again at position 5? But the pattern is fixed: position 1=S, position 3=I, position 4=L. Position 2 and 5 missing. So ""SKILL"" would be S(1),K(2),I(3),L(4),L(5). So if the fifth letter is L, that's possible? Then the word would have two L's? But have we tested L only once? In guess 3, we guessed L at position 4 and got ✓, meaning L is at position 4. If the word has L at position 5 too, then when we guessed ""shily"", L was only at position 4, so if there is another L at position 5, we didn't test it? So we don't know about that.

Therefore, we must consider the possibility? But also, S is only at position 1? Or could be doubled? We don't know.

But let's list possible words matching the pattern S? I L?, where ? are letters not excluded.

Also, the word must be 5 letters and English words.

So candidate words:

- ""SKILL"": S,K,I,L,L → K for position 2, L for position 5? But pattern: positions: S(1),K(2),I(3),L(4),L(5). So letter at position 5 is L. So we need to consider repeated letters? Yes.

Similarly, other words:

- ""SPILL"": S,P,I,L,L → P at 2, L at 5→ but P and L.

- ""SPIFF""? S,P,I,F,F → F can be? But pattern has L at position 4? In ""SPIFF"", positions: S(1),P(2),I(3),F(4),F(5). But we know position 4 must be L, so 'F(4)' would be wrong? So for position 4, we have L fixed.

Therefore, the word must have L at position 4? So the pattern is fixed: letter 1=S, letter 3=I, letter 4=L.

So possible English words: S _ I L _

Fill in the blanks.

Position 2: any letter except excluded? And position 5: any letter except excluded.

And the letters must form a word.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T,H,Y → we cannot use these.

Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

Also, vowels: U and sometimes Y, but Y excluded.

Also, I is in position 3, so maybe position 2 or 5 can be vowel U? Or consonants.

Now, possible words:

- ""SKILL"": S(1),K(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → K and L? Position 5 is L? Possible? The word ""skill"" ends with double L? Actually, ""skill"" is S-K-I-L-L? Yes.

- ""SPILL"": S(1),P(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → P at 2, L at 5.

- ""STILL"": S(1),T(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → T excluded? Guess 2 T(x) → cannot.

- ""SWILL"": S(1),W(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → W available? Yes.

- ""SHILL"": S(1),H(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → but H is excluded? Guess 3 H(x) → H not in word → cannot.

- ""DRILL"": D,R,I,L,L → R excluded? Cannot.

- ""GRIL? ""GRILL"" → G(1),R(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → R excluded.

- ""QUILL"": Q,U,I,L,L → positions: Q(1),U(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → but position 1 must be S? So not.

We need position 1=S fixed? Yes.

So: only words like SKILL, SPILL, SWILL, or with position 5 not L.

Position 5 doesn't necessarily have to be L; it can be a different letter.

For example:

- ""SOLID"": S,O,L,I,D → O excluded, and position 3=L? Not.

- ""SPILE"": S,P,I,L,E → E excluded.

- ""SPILT"": S,P,I,L,T → T excluded.

- ""SPIKY"": S,P,I,K,Y → Y excluded and no L at position 4? Position 4 must be L? This guess has K at position 4? Not.

Pattern: letter 4 must be L? From feedback, position 4 is L.

So we must have L at position 4.

Therefore, words ending with IL? No: pattern S? I L ? → so position 5 can be anything.

Examples: 

- ""SKILT"" not a word.

- ""SKULK"" S,K,U,L,K → position 3: U? Not I.

Position 3 must be I, so ""S K I L K""? ""SKILK"" not a word.

- ""SPI?L"" — we have position 4 L, so position 5 is separate.

Possible words:

- ""SPIEL"": S,P,I,E,L → E excluded and structure: positions S(1),P(2),I(3),E(4),L(5)? But L must be position 4? Here L is position 5? Not.

- ""STILE"": T and E excluded and L at position 4? S,T,I,L,E → position 4 L, position 5 E: E excluded.

- Perhaps ""SVIZL"" not a word.

With L at position 4:

- ""STAIL""? Not standard.

Common words: 

- ""SMILY"" but M excluded and Y excluded? And position 5 Y? Not.

Actually, from the pattern, let's think of English words that start with S, third letter I, fourth letter L.

So: S ? I L ?

Letters available: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

Now, possible:

- If position 5 is L: as in SKILL, SPILL, SWILL. Then position 2: K, P, W respectively.

- If position 5 is not L:

  - ""B"": ""SKILB"" not word.

  - ""D"": ""build"" is B,U,I,L,D → not starting with S.

  - S?ILD → S? I L D? But letter 2 must be filled.

  For example: ""GILD"" not S.

  ""SKILD"" not word.

  - ""F"": ""SKILF"" no.

  Perhaps ""U"": S? I L U? Like ""SIGLU""?

Not common.

Or ""V"": ""SPILV"" no.

So hard to find with position 5 not L.

Perhaps: ""SHUL?"" but H excluded.

Another word: ""SULKS"" but U? S(1),U(2),L(3),K(4),S(5) → position 3: L? But we need I at position 3? Not.

Position 3 must be I? Fixed.

Therefore, the common words are SKILL, SPILL, SWILL, etc., where position 5 is L? Meaning double L at the end.

But ""SKILL"" is a valid word.

Also, ""STILL"" but T excluded.

"" BUILD"" no.

Therefore, possible candidates: 
- SKILL: positions: S(1),K(2),I(3),L(4),L(5)
- SPILL: S(1),P(2),I(3),L(4),L(5)
- SWILL: S(1),W(2),I(3),L(4),L(5)
- Also, ""SPILL"" and ""SKILL"" are more common.

Now, we need to find which one? We don't have info about position 2 and position 5? But position 5 is likely L? But we have to confirm the letter at position 2.

Also, what about letter at position 5? If it is L, but that's duplicated? But L is included.

In terms of feedback: if we guess a word with two L's, and L at position 4 is correct, then L at position 5 might get ✓ or -, depending on if there is another L? However, we don't know if there is a repeated L.

Since we think the word might be among SKILL, SPILL, SWILL, but SWILL? W available? Yes.

We can choose one of them for our guess? But we have only a few guesses left? We have 3 guesses done; 3 left? We started guess 1,2,3; this is guess 4.

We also have GU?, but GUILD has U? But U for position 2? But pattern S?IL? So position 2 must be the same.

For example, ""SUILS"" not standard word.

Perhaps ""KILPS"" no.

I think we have to choose one of SKILL, SPILL, SWILL.

But SWILL: S,W,I,L,L? W is common? Not very.

Also available words: perhaps ""DIALS"" but already fixed.

Or we can guess a word that uses non-repeated letters to test? For example, if we can find a word with S?I L ? with ? a different letter.

But ""SIGIL"" — S,I,G,I,L → positions: S(1),I(2),G(3),I(4),L(5). But we need I at position 3? Not; position 3: G? But we need position 3=I fixed? So not.

Another: ""SILKS"" — S,I,L,K,S? Positions: S(1),I(2),L(3),K(4),S(5). But position 3: L? But we need I at position 3? Not.

Position 3 must be I? From the feedback.

So, it seems rare to have position 5 not L.

But let me search: ""SQUIB"" no L? Must have L at position 4? Not.

I think we must accept that position 5 is L? And the word is S K I L L or S P I L L or S W I L L? But all valid.

Now, which consonant for position 2?

We need to test what? But in the feedback we have L only once? With ""shily"" we guessed L at position 4 and got ✓, but that doesn't tell if there's another L? If we guess a word with L at position 5 and if it's also correct, we get ✓ for both? But if not, we get L at position 5 as x or -? But since we already know L is in the word? Position 4 L is ✓, so L is in word? Then, if we put L at position 5, it should be - or ✓.

Possible:

If we guess ""SKILL"", and the word is ""SKILL"", we get all ✓.

But if the word is ""SPILL"", then K would be x, but S and I are both ✓? Then feedback for S(✓), K(x), I(✓), L(✓), L(?) if position 5 L also ✓? Or if position 5 L is not in the word? But it is.

If the word is ""SPILL"", and guess ""SKILL"": 
- S(1): same? ✓
- K(2): but position 2 of ""SPILL"" is P → not K, so if K not in word? x? But K not excluded? So probably x
- I(3): same ✓
- L(4): same ✓
- L(5): L is in word? If the word is ""SPILL"", it has only one L? Then position 5 L of guess is L, but if secret has only one L at position 4, then L at position 5 is not in the word? No, L is in word, so L at position 5 should get minus? Because letter L is in word, but at wrong position? Since position 4 is already taken? But Wordle feedback for repeated letters: each instance evaluated independently.

For example: secret word, say, ""SPILL"" has two L's? No, ""SPILL"" is S,P,I,L,L — so two L's: at positions 4 and 5.

If we guess ""SKILL"" with K at position 2? And positions 5 is L? Then feedback: S(✓), K( may be x if K not in word), I(✓), L(✓), L( could be ✓ if position 5 L, or minus?).

But if secret word ""SPILL"" has L at position 4 and 5? Then when we guess ""SKILL"" with L at position 4 and 5? Then both L? Secret S,P,I,L,L:

- Guess: S,K,I,L,L

- S(1) vs S(1) → ✓
- K(2) vs P(2) → if P != K, and K not in secret? Then x
- I(3) vs I(3) → ✓
- L(4) vs L(4) → ✓
- L(5) vs L(5) → ✓? But ""SPILL"" has L at position 5? Yes.

So all L? But K is wrong.

If the secret were ""SKILL"" then all ✓.

But if the secret is ""SPILL"", then we get only K wrong? But we guessed K, and the secret has P? So K not in word? Then position 2: x? And others ✓? But position 5 L would be ✓?

Feedback depends on the actual word.

So we can guess one of them: SKILL or SPILL.

Since we have to choose, let's think about available letters.

We haven't tested many: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,U,V,W,X,Z

P and K are common? Both possible.

We could also guess a word that has different letters at position 2 and 5 to get more information.

For example, position 2: unknown, position 5: unknown.

But we think it's likely L at position 5? But not necessarily.

Perhaps ""SQUIZ"" not, or other? Not.

Another word: ""SULPH"" but H excluded and U? Not with I at position 3? S U L P H? No.

Perhaps "" SKIMP"" but M excluded.

Rare word: ""SCULP"" not S?I?L.

I think we have to accept double L.

Maybe ""PUBIS"" no L.

Perhaps ""IDLES"" not starting with S.

Let's list one: ""SPLIT"" T excluded and no L at position 4? Position 4: I? Not L.

Not.

Therefore, we are limited to SKILL, SPILL, SWILL? SWILL with W.

W is less common? SWILL means a type of feed? Yes.

K: SKILL, P: SPILL

We can guess ""SPINK"" not a word.

Better to choose SPILL or SKILL.

Or, since position 5 is likely L, we can assume that? And focus on position 2.

Using the available letters, we can guess a word that has a letter at position 2 that is common, and position 5 L? But we are guessing the word, not just testing? Because we only have 6 guesses? We want to get it in this or next? But we must guess.

Also, in previous guesses, we haven't tested B, D, F, G, etc.? But in this pattern, position 2 and 5 have constraints.

Guess ""BUILT"" but T excluded.

Perhaps ""SKULK"" not.

So, I suggest guessing ""SPILL"" as it is a common word.

Or ""SKILL"".

But let's see: if we guess correctly, we win.

If not, we get feedback: which position is wrong? Then we re.

For example, guess ""SKILL"":

- If secret is ""SKILL"", all ✓.
- If secret is ""SPILL"", we get S(✓), K(x) if K not in secret? But K not excluded? Then position 2: K? Secret has P? So K not in word? x? Then position 5: L? Secret has L at position 5? Then L? But we have L at position 4 and 5? Secret SPILL has L at 4 and? 5? So guess L at position 5 vs L at position 5: ✓? So feedback: S(✓), K(x), I(✓), L(✓), L(✓)? But the last L is ✓ because position 5 L is correct? Even though it is repeated? Yes.

Similarly, if secret is ""SPILL"", we get for ""SKILL"": S(✓), K(x), I(✓), L(✓), L(✓) —— positions: L at position 4: ✓, L at position 5: ✓.

K: x? But K not in secret? So x.

Similarly, we would know K is not in position 2? To be tried with P or W.

But only with one guess? We waste.

To conserve, we can guess a word that doesn't assume position 5 is L? But for that, need a word with position 5 a new letter.

For example, S? I L ? with ? a novel letter.

For instance, ""SKELM"" not, or ""STILP"" not.

Perhaps ""GUILE"" G,U,I,L,E → E excluded, and position 2 U? But pattern S?I L? Not.

Not starting with S.

Only possibility with position 5 not L might be ""SIZ?L"" but not.

""STILB"" not word.

Therefore, I think the most probable are SKILL, SPILL, SWILL.

But SWILL: S,W,I,L,L? W is available.

Now, we have not tested W yet? So if we guess SKILL or SPILL, we might test K or P, both common.

We can guess ""SKULS"" not word.

Or guess ""SWILL"" to test W? If it's incorrect, we know the letter at position 2 is W or not? But we can then rule out W.

Similarly, guess ""SPILL"" to test P.

But in one guess, if we guess wrong, we use a guess.

Since we know S, L, I, and the pattern is S? I L ?, with position 5 likely L, I'll guess SKILL for position 2 K.

But K is common? Not necessarily.

Another word: ""SHILL"" but H excluded.

We can choose a word that uses a new vowel or consonant.

Position 2 can be U: ""SUIL?"" not standard? ""SULPH"" no or ""SUITE"" not S?I L?.

""SUITE"" has E excluded.

Not.

Therefore, I'll go with SKILL.

Guess ""SKILL"".

So the answer should be one of SKILL, SPILL, SWILL. Let's hope.
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses, the secret word must:
- Include the letters S (at position 1), I (at position 3), and L (at position 4) as confirmed by ✓ marks.
- Exclude letters C, R, A, N, E (from Guess 1), M, O, T (from Guess 2), H, Y (from Guess 3).
- Have S at position 1 (✓ in Guess 3) and L at position 4 (✓), with I locked in position 3 (✓ from both Guess 2 and Guess 3).
- Avoid placing S in position 4 (known from Guess 2), which is not relevant anymore since S is at position 1.

Given the pattern S _ I L _ for the secret word (positions: 1=S, 3=I, 4=L), possible candidates include words like ""SKILL"", ""SPILL"", or ""SWILL"" (all with L at position 5). Given the constraints, ""SKILL"" is a common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters. Guessing ""SKILL"" will confirm if K is in position 2 and if position 5 is L, or provide feedback for refinement.

<guess>skill</guess>",skill,"We have feedback from three guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" gave C(x), R(x), A(x), N(x), E(x) → So letters C, R, A, N, E are not in the secret word.

Guess 2: ""moist"" gave M(x), O(x), I(✓), S(-), T(x) → Therefore:
- I is in the word and in position 3 (that's the only I in the guess, so it must be the correct letter and position).
- S is in the word, but not in position 4. Since I is at position 3, S cannot be at position 3 either. So S must be in positions 1, 2, or 5.
- M, O, T are not in the word.

Guess 3: ""shily"" gave S(✓), H(x), I(✓), L(✓), Y(x) → Therefore:
- S is in position 1 and correct (✓). So the first letter of the secret word is S.
- I is in position 3 and correct (we already knew this).
- L is in position 4 and correct (✓). So the fourth letter is L.
- H and Y are not in the word (x).

We also know that the third letter is I and fourth is L. So the word is S _ I L _.

From the feedback of guess 2, S is in the word and not in position 4, and now we know it's in position 1. Also, the ✓ for S in position 1 confirms that.

Now, missing positions: position 2 and position 5.

We know the secret word has the pattern: S ? I L ?

We have also excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, M, O, T, H, Y.

And from the feedback, no other information except the positions.

Now, letters that are in the word: S, I, L. And they are fixed in positions: S(1), I(3), L(4).

We need to find the letter for position 2 and position 5.

Also, note that from the previous feedback, all excluded letters are not in the word. So our available letters are: B, D, F, G, J, K, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z and vowels: U (since A, E, I, O are either excluded or used; I is used but we could have another I? But position 3 is I, so position 2 or 5 could be I? Possible repeated letters? However, in guess 3, we guessed S,H,I,L,Y. The I was at position 3 and got ✓, which only confirms that position. But if there were another I in the word, it wasn't tested because we didn't put it in the guess. Similarly, with L.

So we cannot rule out repeated letters? But let's see.

We have to form a word: S ? I L ?

Now, possible words:

- The fifth letter could be the same as one of the existing? Or different.

Common English words: SILKY? But K and Y: Y is excluded? From guess 3, Y(x). Cannot be.

SILLY? S,I,L,L,Y. But Y excluded and L repeated? Pattern: S(1), I(2), L(3), L(4), ? But we have I at position 3? So S(1), ?(2), I(3), L(4), ?(5). So ""SILLY"" does not fit because I is at position 2, not 3.

Similarly, ""SKILL"" — S(1),K(2),I(3),L(4),L(5). Pattern fits? S(1), K(2), I(3), L(4), ? ; but L is only at position 4? Then fifth letter? In ""SKILL"", it ends with double L? So S(1),K(2),I(3),L(4),L(5). So L is repeated? And position 4 and 5 are both L? But we have position 4 is L but position 5 might be different.

In our pattern: position 4 is L, so in ""SKILL"", after I at position 3, then L at position 4? And L again at position 5? But the pattern is fixed: position 1=S, position 3=I, position 4=L. Position 2 and 5 missing. So ""SKILL"" would be S(1),K(2),I(3),L(4),L(5). So if the fifth letter is L, that's possible? Then the word would have two L's? But have we tested L only once? In guess 3, we guessed L at position 4 and got ✓, meaning L is at position 4. If the word has L at position 5 too, then when we guessed ""shily"", L was only at position 4, so if there is another L at position 5, we didn't test it? So we don't know about that.

Therefore, we must consider the possibility? But also, S is only at position 1? Or could be doubled? We don't know.

But let's list possible words matching the pattern S? I L?, where ? are letters not excluded.

Also, the word must be 5 letters and English words.

So candidate words:

- ""SKILL"": S,K,I,L,L → K for position 2, L for position 5? But pattern: positions: S(1),K(2),I(3),L(4),L(5). So letter at position 5 is L. So we need to consider repeated letters? Yes.

Similarly, other words:

- ""SPILL"": S,P,I,L,L → P at 2, L at 5→ but P and L.

- ""SPIFF""? S,P,I,F,F → F can be? But pattern has L at position 4? In ""SPIFF"", positions: S(1),P(2),I(3),F(4),F(5). But we know position 4 must be L, so 'F(4)' would be wrong? So for position 4, we have L fixed.

Therefore, the word must have L at position 4? So the pattern is fixed: letter 1=S, letter 3=I, letter 4=L.

So possible English words: S _ I L _

Fill in the blanks.

Position 2: any letter except excluded? And position 5: any letter except excluded.

And the letters must form a word.

Excluded letters: C,R,A,N,E,M,O,T,H,Y → we cannot use these.

Available: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

Also, vowels: U and sometimes Y, but Y excluded.

Also, I is in position 3, so maybe position 2 or 5 can be vowel U? Or consonants.

Now, possible words:

- ""SKILL"": S(1),K(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → K and L? Position 5 is L? Possible? The word ""skill"" ends with double L? Actually, ""skill"" is S-K-I-L-L? Yes.

- ""SPILL"": S(1),P(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → P at 2, L at 5.

- ""STILL"": S(1),T(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → T excluded? Guess 2 T(x) → cannot.

- ""SWILL"": S(1),W(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → W available? Yes.

- ""SHILL"": S(1),H(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → but H is excluded? Guess 3 H(x) → H not in word → cannot.

- ""DRILL"": D,R,I,L,L → R excluded? Cannot.

- ""GRIL? ""GRILL"" → G(1),R(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → R excluded.

- ""QUILL"": Q,U,I,L,L → positions: Q(1),U(2),I(3),L(4),L(5) → but position 1 must be S? So not.

We need position 1=S fixed? Yes.

So: only words like SKILL, SPILL, SWILL, or with position 5 not L.

Position 5 doesn't necessarily have to be L; it can be a different letter.

For example:

- ""SOLID"": S,O,L,I,D → O excluded, and position 3=L? Not.

- ""SPILE"": S,P,I,L,E → E excluded.

- ""SPILT"": S,P,I,L,T → T excluded.

- ""SPIKY"": S,P,I,K,Y → Y excluded and no L at position 4? Position 4 must be L? This guess has K at position 4? Not.

Pattern: letter 4 must be L? From feedback, position 4 is L.

So we must have L at position 4.

Therefore, words ending with IL? No: pattern S? I L ? → so position 5 can be anything.

Examples: 

- ""SKILT"" not a word.

- ""SKULK"" S,K,U,L,K → position 3: U? Not I.

Position 3 must be I, so ""S K I L K""? ""SKILK"" not a word.

- ""SPI?L"" — we have position 4 L, so position 5 is separate.

Possible words:

- ""SPIEL"": S,P,I,E,L → E excluded and structure: positions S(1),P(2),I(3),E(4),L(5)? But L must be position 4? Here L is position 5? Not.

- ""STILE"": T and E excluded and L at position 4? S,T,I,L,E → position 4 L, position 5 E: E excluded.

- Perhaps ""SVIZL"" not a word.

With L at position 4:

- ""STAIL""? Not standard.

Common words: 

- ""SMILY"" but M excluded and Y excluded? And position 5 Y? Not.

Actually, from the pattern, let's think of English words that start with S, third letter I, fourth letter L.

So: S ? I L ?

Letters available: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Z

Now, possible:

- If position 5 is L: as in SKILL, SPILL, SWILL. Then position 2: K, P, W respectively.

- If position 5 is not L:

  - ""B"": ""SKILB"" not word.

  - ""D"": ""build"" is B,U,I,L,D → not starting with S.

  - S?ILD → S? I L D? But letter 2 must be filled.

  For example: ""GILD"" not S.

  ""SKILD"" not word.

  - ""F"": ""SKILF"" no.

  Perhaps ""U"": S? I L U? Like ""SIGLU""?

Not common.

Or ""V"": ""SPILV"" no.

So hard to find with position 5 not L.

Perhaps: ""SHUL?"" but H excluded.

Another word: ""SULKS"" but U? S(1),U(2),L(3),K(4),S(5) → position 3: L? But we need I at position 3? Not.

Position 3 must be I? Fixed.

Therefore, the common words are SKILL, SPILL, SWILL, etc., where position 5 is L? Meaning double L at the end.

But ""SKILL"" is a valid word.

Also, ""STILL"" but T excluded.

"" BUILD"" no.

Therefore, possible candidates: 
- SKILL: positions: S(1),K(2),I(3),L(4),L(5)
- SPILL: S(1),P(2),I(3),L(4),L(5)
- SWILL: S(1),W(2),I(3),L(4),L(5)
- Also, ""SPILL"" and ""SKILL"" are more common.

Now, we need to find which one? We don't have info about position 2 and position 5? But position 5 is likely L? But we have to confirm the letter at position 2.

Also, what about letter at position 5? If it is L, but that's duplicated? But L is included.

In terms of feedback: if we guess a word with two L's, and L at position 4 is correct, then L at position 5 might get ✓ or -, depending on if there is another L? However, we don't know if there is a repeated L.

Since we think the word might be among SKILL, SPILL, SWILL, but SWILL? W available? Yes.

We can choose one of them for our guess? But we have only a few guesses left? We have 3 guesses done; 3 left? We started guess 1,2,3; this is guess 4.

We also have GU?, but GUILD has U? But U for position 2? But pattern S?IL? So position 2 must be the same.

For example, ""SUILS"" not standard word.

Perhaps ""KILPS"" no.

I think we have to choose one of SKILL, SPILL, SWILL.

But SWILL: S,W,I,L,L? W is common? Not very.

Also available words: perhaps ""DIALS"" but already fixed.

Or we can guess a word that uses non-repeated letters to test? For example, if we can find a word with S?I L ? with ? a different letter.

But ""SIGIL"" — S,I,G,I,L → positions: S(1),I(2),G(3),I(4),L(5). But we need I at position 3? Not; position 3: G? But we need position 3=I fixed? So not.

Another: ""SILKS"" — S,I,L,K,S? Positions: S(1),I(2),L(3),K(4),S(5). But position 3: L? But we need I at position 3? Not.

Position 3 must be I? From the feedback.

So, it seems rare to have position 5 not L.

But let me search: ""SQUIB"" no L? Must have L at position 4? Not.

I think we must accept that position 5 is L? And the word is S K I L L or S P I L L or S W I L L? But all valid.

Now, which consonant for position 2?

We need to test what? But in the feedback we have L only once? With ""shily"" we guessed L at position 4 and got ✓, but that doesn't tell if there's another L? If we guess a word with L at position 5 and if it's also correct, we get ✓ for both? But if not, we get L at position 5 as x or -? But since we already know L is in the word? Position 4 L is ✓, so L is in word? Then, if we put L at position 5, it should be - or ✓.

Possible:

If we guess ""SKILL"", and the word is ""SKILL"", we get all ✓.

But if the word is ""SPILL"", then K would be x, but S and I are both ✓? Then feedback for S(✓), K(x), I(✓), L(✓), L(?) if position 5 L also ✓? Or if position 5 L is not in the word? But it is.

If the word is ""SPILL"", and guess ""SKILL"": 
- S(1): same? ✓
- K(2): but position 2 of ""SPILL"" is P → not K, so if K not in word? x? But K not excluded? So probably x
- I(3): same ✓
- L(4): same ✓
- L(5): L is in word? If the word is ""SPILL"", it has only one L? Then position 5 L of guess is L, but if secret has only one L at position 4, then L at position 5 is not in the word? No, L is in word, so L at position 5 should get minus? Because letter L is in word, but at wrong position? Since position 4 is already taken? But Wordle feedback for repeated letters: each instance evaluated independently.

For example: secret word, say, ""SPILL"" has two L's? No, ""SPILL"" is S,P,I,L,L — so two L's: at positions 4 and 5.

If we guess ""SKILL"" with K at position 2? And positions 5 is L? Then feedback: S(✓), K( may be x if K not in word), I(✓), L(✓), L( could be ✓ if position 5 L, or minus?).

But if secret word ""SPILL"" has L at position 4 and 5? Then when we guess ""SKILL"" with L at position 4 and 5? Then both L? Secret S,P,I,L,L:

- Guess: S,K,I,L,L

- S(1) vs S(1) → ✓
- K(2) vs P(2) → if P != K, and K not in secret? Then x
- I(3) vs I(3) → ✓
- L(4) vs L(4) → ✓
- L(5) vs L(5) → ✓? But ""SPILL"" has L at position 5? Yes.

So all L? But K is wrong.

If the secret were ""SKILL"" then all ✓.

But if the secret is ""SPILL"", then we get only K wrong? But we guessed K, and the secret has P? So K not in word? Then position 2: x? And others ✓? But position 5 L would be ✓?

Feedback depends on the actual word.

So we can guess one of them: SKILL or SPILL.

Since we have to choose, let's think about available letters.

We haven't tested many: B,D,F,G,J,K,P,U,V,W,X,Z

P and K are common? Both possible.

We could also guess a word that has different letters at position 2 and 5 to get more information.

For example, position 2: unknown, position 5: unknown.

But we think it's likely L at position 5? But not necessarily.

Perhaps ""SQUIZ"" not, or other? Not.

Another word: ""SULPH"" but H excluded and U? Not with I at position 3? S U L P H? No.

Perhaps "" SKIMP"" but M excluded.

Rare word: ""SCULP"" not S?I?L.

I think we have to accept double L.

Maybe ""PUBIS"" no L.

Perhaps ""IDLES"" not starting with S.

Let's list one: ""SPLIT"" T excluded and no L at position 4? Position 4: I? Not L.

Not.

Therefore, we are limited to SKILL, SPILL, SWILL? SWILL with W.

W is less common? SWILL means a type of feed? Yes.

K: SKILL, P: SPILL

We can guess ""SPINK"" not a word.

Better to choose SPILL or SKILL.

Or, since position 5 is likely L, we can assume that? And focus on position 2.

Using the available letters, we can guess a word that has a letter at position 2 that is common, and position 5 L? But we are guessing the word, not just testing? Because we only have 6 guesses? We want to get it in this or next? But we must guess.

Also, in previous guesses, we haven't tested B, D, F, G, etc.? But in this pattern, position 2 and 5 have constraints.

Guess ""BUILT"" but T excluded.

Perhaps ""SKULK"" not.

So, I suggest guessing ""SPILL"" as it is a common word.

Or ""SKILL"".

But let's see: if we guess correctly, we win.

If not, we get feedback: which position is wrong? Then we re.

For example, guess ""SKILL"":

- If secret is ""SKILL"", all ✓.
- If secret is ""SPILL"", we get S(✓), K(x) if K not in secret? But K not excluded? Then position 2: K? Secret has P? So K not in word? x? Then position 5: L? Secret has L at position 5? Then L? But we have L at position 4 and 5? Secret SPILL has L at 4 and? 5? So guess L at position 5 vs L at position 5: ✓? So feedback: S(✓), K(x), I(✓), L(✓), L(✓)? But the last L is ✓ because position 5 L is correct? Even though it is repeated? Yes.

Similarly, if secret is ""SPILL"", we get for ""SKILL"": S(✓), K(x), I(✓), L(✓), L(✓) —— positions: L at position 4: ✓, L at position 5: ✓.

K: x? But K not in secret? So x.

Similarly, we would know K is not in position 2? To be tried with P or W.

But only with one guess? We waste.

To conserve, we can guess a word that doesn't assume position 5 is L? But for that, need a word with position 5 a new letter.

For example, S? I L ? with ? a novel letter.

For instance, ""SKELM"" not, or ""STILP"" not.

Perhaps ""GUILE"" G,U,I,L,E → E excluded, and position 2 U? But pattern S?I L? Not.

Not starting with S.

Only possibility with position 5 not L might be ""SIZ?L"" but not.

""STILB"" not word.

Therefore, I think the most probable are SKILL, SPILL, SWILL.

But SWILL: S,W,I,L,L? W is available.

Now, we have not tested W yet? So if we guess SKILL or SPILL, we might test K or P, both common.

We can guess ""SKULS"" not word.

Or guess ""SWILL"" to test W? If it's incorrect, we know the letter at position 2 is W or not? But we can then rule out W.

Similarly, guess ""SPILL"" to test P.

But in one guess, if we guess wrong, we use a guess.

Since we know S, L, I, and the pattern is S? I L ?, with position 5 likely L, I'll guess SKILL for position 2 K.

But K is common? Not necessarily.

Another word: ""SHILL"" but H excluded.

We can choose a word that uses a new vowel or consonant.

Position 2 can be U: ""SUIL?"" not standard? ""SULPH"" no or ""SUITE"" not S?I L?.

""SUITE"" has E excluded.

Not.

Therefore, I'll go with SKILL.

Guess ""SKILL"".

So the answer should be one of SKILL, SPILL, SWILL. Let's hope.Based on the feedback from previous guesses, the secret word must:
- Include the letters S (at position 1), I (at position 3), and L (at position 4) as confirmed by ✓ marks.
- Exclude letters C, R, A, N, E (from Guess 1), M, O, T (from Guess 2), H, Y (from Guess 3).
- Have S at position 1 (✓ in Guess 3) and L at position 4 (✓), with I locked in position 3 (✓ from both Guess 2 and Guess 3).
- Avoid placing S in position 4 (known from Guess 2), which is not relevant anymore since S is at position 1.

Given the pattern S _ I L _ for the secret word (positions: 1=S, 3=I, 4=L), possible candidates include words like ""SKILL"", ""SPILL"", or ""SWILL"" (all with L at position 5). Given the constraints, ""SKILL"" is a common word that fits the pattern and uses available letters. Guessing ""SKILL"" will confirm if K is in position 2 and if position 5 is L, or provide feedback for refinement.",Guess 4: skill -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) K(✓) I(✓) L(✓) L(✓),SUCCESS
