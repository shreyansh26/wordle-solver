We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, since we have three incorrect letters (C, A, N) and two correct letters (R and E) but in the wrong positions, we can use this to form our next guess.

 Important: The secret word must contain R and E, but not C, A, N.

 Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 1. Does not contain C, A, N.
 2. Contains R and E (but not in the positions we already tried for them? Actually, we know R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5, but they could be in other positions).

 We also want to try to place R and E in new positions and include other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think about the positions:
 - R was in position 2 in ""crane"" -> so in the secret word, R is not in position 2. Therefore, R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 - E was in position 5 in ""crane"" -> so in the secret word, E is not in position 5. Therefore, E must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We can also consider that the word has 5 letters and we have two of them (R and E) but we don't know the other three.

 Since we have eliminated C, A, N, we can avoid those.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and E, and uses other common letters (like S, T, L, O, etc.) and that doesn't have C, A, N.

 We also want to try to place R and E in positions we haven't tried for them. For example, we can try R in position 1, 3, or 4 and E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not the same as R).

 Some words that come to mind:

 Option 1: ""ROLES"" -> 
   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R, since previously we had it in position 2 and now we try position 1)
   O is a new letter
   L is new
   E in position 4 (previously we had E in position 5, so position 4 is new for E)
   S is new

 But note: we don't know if O, L, S are in the word or not.

 Option 2: ""STORE"" -> 
   S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, R in 4, E in 5 -> but wait, we know E is not in position 5 (from previous feedback). So we cannot put E in position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting E in position 5.

 So let's avoid putting E in position 5 and R in position 2.

 Another option: ""TRIED"" -> 
   T in 1, R in 2 -> but we know R is not in position 2? Actually, we had R in position 2 and got a '-' meaning it's present but not in that position. So we should avoid putting R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So better to put R in a new position.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E.

 I think ""ROLES"" is a good candidate because:
   R is in position 1 (new for R)
   E is in position 4 (new for E, previously we had it in 5)
   We are testing O, L, S.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RICES"" but that has C and we know C is not in the word. So we must avoid C, A, N.

 Another word: ""ROUTE"" -> 
   R in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, E in 5 -> but E is in position 5 which we know is wrong. So avoid.

 How about ""RIPER""? But that has two R's and we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we have only one R so far. But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. Actually, the feedback might not account for duplicates properly. So it's better to avoid duplicates for now.

 Another idea: ""RISES"" -> but we have S twice? And we don't know if S is in the word. Also, R in position 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we are avoiding E in 5? Actually, E is in 4, which is good. But we have two S's. Let's avoid duplicates for now.

 How about ""ROBES""? 
   R in 1, O in 2, B in 3, E in 4, S in 5 -> E is in 4 (good) and S in 5 (new). But we are testing O and B.

 But note: we don't know if the word has O or B.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position and R in a different position, and also test other common letters.

 Another common word: ""TIGER"" -> 
   T in 1, I in 2, G in 3, E in 4, R in 5 -> 
   Here, R is in position 5 (which is new for R) and E is in position 4 (new for E). Also, we test T, I, G.

 But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. T, I, G are not in the forbidden list.

 However, we have to make sure the word is valid.

 Let me check: ""TIGER"" is a valid word.

 But wait: we are putting R in position 5 and E in position 4. We know from the first guess that E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is a good try. And R is not in position 2, so position 5 is a new position for R.

 So ""TIGER"" seems good.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RIPEN"" but that has N which we know is not in the word. So avoid.

 Another option: ""ROBES"" as above.

 But I think ""TIGER"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, G and places R and E in new positions.

 However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 Let's go with ""TIGER"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has the letter E in position 4? Then we get a check. Similarly for R in position 5.

 We are also testing three new letters: T, I, G.

 So, next guess: ""TIGER""

<guess>tiger</guess>

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.
- R is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R and E** (in positions other than 2 and 5, respectively).
- Must exclude C, A, N.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, G) to gather more information.

The word **""tiger""** fits these criteria:
- Places R in position 5 (new position for R).
- Places E in position 4 (new position for E).
- Tests new letters T, I, G.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).

 But wait: we are putting R in position 5 and E in position 4. We know from the first guess that E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is a good try. And R is not in position 2, so position 5 is a new position for R.

 So ""TIGER"" seems good.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RIPEN"" but that has N which we know is not in the word. So avoid.

 Another option: ""ROBES"" as above.

 But I think ""TIGER"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, G and places R and E in new positions.

 However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 Let's go with ""TIGER"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has the letter E in position 4? Then we get a check. Similarly for R in position 5.

 We are also testing three new letters: T, I, G.

 So, next guess: ""TIGER""

<guess>tiger</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.
- R is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R and E** (in positions other than 2 and 5, respectively).
- Must exclude C, A, N.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, G) to gather more information.

The word **""tiger""** fits these criteria:
- Places R in position 5 (new position for R).
- Places E in position 4 (new position for E).
- Tests new letters T, I, G.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).

We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C: not in word
- R: in word but not position 2
- A: not in word
- N: not in word
- E: in word but not position 5

Guess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
- T: not in word
- I: not in word
- G: not in word
- E: correct and in position 4 (since we placed E in position 4 and got ✓)
- R: correct and in position 5 (since we placed R in position 5 and got ✓)

So now we know:
- The secret word has E in the fourth position and R in the fifth position. So the word ends with ""E R"".
- The third letter of the secret word is not G, and also not N (from first guess), and not I or any other eliminated letters.
- The first letter is not C, A, T, or G (all eliminated).
- Available letters: We know E and R are fixed at positions 4 and 5.

We also know from the first feedback that E is in the word (but not position 5, which we now know is position 4 fixed) and R is in the word (not position 2, and we now know it's in position 5).

The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ E R

We have eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G

Now, we need to guess a word that fits _ _ _ E R and uses only letters that haven't been eliminated. We know that the missing three letters cannot be C, A, N, T, I, G.

Also, from the first guess, we had R in position 2 as a wrong position (but now we know R is in position 5, so that's consistent). We also had E in position 5 as wrong (now fixed at 4).

So we are missing the first three letters.

We must avoid: C, A, N, T, I, G.

We also know that R and E are already placed correctly, so the first three letters must not be R or E? Actually, they can be other occurrences? 

But wait: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. In the feedback, we only got one R and one E marked. For example, in the first guess, we had only one R (at position 2) and one E (at position 5). Now in the second guess, we have E and R at positions 4 and 5 correct.

If there were duplicates, the feedback might not have shown them? Actually, the feedback would have shown duplicates. For instance, if the secret word had two R's, then if we guess one R in the correct position and one R in the wrong position, both would get marked accordingly. But in our case, we only have one R found. Similarly, only one E found.

So probably, there are no duplicates for R and E, meaning the first three letters are neither R nor E.

Therefore, we must choose a word with three distinct letters (not eliminated, and not E or R) for the first three positions.

Let's recall common English letters: We have vowels left: O, U. Consonants: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters to maximize information.

Let's form a word that ends with ""ER"".

We have to guess the first three letters.

Possible words: 
For example: LUMBER -> but we have U? And it's 6 letters? No, we need 5 letters: first three.

List some 5-letter words ending with ""ER"":

- Answer: AN?ER but A and N are eliminated, so not.
- UDDER: but U, D, D -> D is available? And we can try U and D.

But let's think of common words.

Actually, we need to use available letters.

We know the following letters are eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G.

So available: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid using letters that are very rare? But let's find a valid word.

We can consider:

- SOWER: S, O, W, E, R -> so pattern S O W E R -> positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:W

But we don't know if S, O, W are in the word.

Similarly, another word: ""POWER"" -> P, O, W, E, R.

Or ""LOWER"" -> L, O, W, E, R.

But we have multiple options. We need to choose one that tests letters we haven't tried.

Since we know positions 4 and 5 are fixed, we only need to get the first three.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that includes common letters that haven't been tested.

Already tested letters (in first two guesses): C, R, A, N, E, T, I, G.

So untested common letters: S, L, O, U, D, M, B, etc.

So we can try a word that has several of these.

For example, with S, O, and L: we have ""SOLER""? Is that a word? Soler is not common. No.

""SOBER"": S, O, B, E, R -> but E and R at 4 and 5 fixed? In ""SOBER"", E and R are at positions 4 and 5? Let's see:
S at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> perfect.

And S, O, B are letters we haven't tested yet.

Similarly, other words: ""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R -> V not tested.

But ""SOBER"" is a valid word meaning not intoxicated.

Another option: ""BOXER"", but we have X? Also, O and X.

But ""SOBER"" seems good.

Alternatively, ""MOWER"": M, O, W, E, R -> M, W not tested.

But ""SOBER"" tests S, O, B.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to get information.

Also, we must remember that the secret word must have the R and E, which we already have.

Now, are there any constraints from the first guess? 

In the first guess (crane), we had R at position 2 marked as present (but not placed). But now we have R at position 5. Since R is only present once, and now at 5, so that should be fine. The misplaced R at position 2 doesn't conflict because we have it at 5.

Similarly for E: in first guess E was at position 5 and misplaced, but now correctly placed at 4? 

Wait, no. In the secret word, E is at position 4, so in the first guess we put E at position 5, which is wrong. And now we have it at 4. So all consistent.

Therefore, a valid guess is ""SOBER"".

But we should consider that the first letter cannot be one of the eliminated? We must not use eliminated letters: so S, O, B are not eliminated (eliminated are C, A, N, T, I, G).

So ""SOBER"" uses S, O, B, all allowed.

Moreover, if we get feedback, we can see which letters are correct.

Another word: ""JOKER"" but J and K are less common. Also, J not eliminated? But we might avoid less common.

""SOBER"" seems good.

Another common word: ""SUPER"" -> S, U, P, E, R -> tests U and P.

But ""SOBER"" tests O and B as well.

I think ""SOBER"" is fine.

So we'll guess ""SOBER"".

But note: we have to be cautious. The word must have exactly the pattern _ _ _ E R.

So: <guess>sober</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from ""crane"" and ""tiger"":
- E and R are confirmed in positions 4 and 5, respectively (word ends with ""ER"").
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G (confirmed absent from the secret word).
- The first three letters must use untested common letters (avoiding E and R duplicates).

The word **""sober""** fits perfectly:
- Tests **S**, **O**, and **B** (common letters not previously tried).
- Maintains E in position 4 and R in position 5.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

This choice will efficiently narrow down possibilities for positions 1–3 while leveraging known correct placements.

<guess>sober</guess>",sober,"We have feedback from two guesses:

 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, since we have three incorrect letters (C, A, N) and two correct letters (R and E) but in the wrong positions, we can use this to form our next guess.

 Important: The secret word must contain R and E, but not C, A, N.

 Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 1. Does not contain C, A, N.
 2. Contains R and E (but not in the positions we already tried for them? Actually, we know R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5, but they could be in other positions).

 We also want to try to place R and E in new positions and include other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think about the positions:
 - R was in position 2 in ""crane"" -> so in the secret word, R is not in position 2. Therefore, R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 - E was in position 5 in ""crane"" -> so in the secret word, E is not in position 5. Therefore, E must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We can also consider that the word has 5 letters and we have two of them (R and E) but we don't know the other three.

 Since we have eliminated C, A, N, we can avoid those.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and E, and uses other common letters (like S, T, L, O, etc.) and that doesn't have C, A, N.

 We also want to try to place R and E in positions we haven't tried for them. For example, we can try R in position 1, 3, or 4 and E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not the same as R).

 Some words that come to mind:

 Option 1: ""ROLES"" -> 
   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R, since previously we had it in position 2 and now we try position 1)
   O is a new letter
   L is new
   E in position 4 (previously we had E in position 5, so position 4 is new for E)
   S is new

 But note: we don't know if O, L, S are in the word or not.

 Option 2: ""STORE"" -> 
   S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, R in 4, E in 5 -> but wait, we know E is not in position 5 (from previous feedback). So we cannot put E in position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting E in position 5.

 So let's avoid putting E in position 5 and R in position 2.

 Another option: ""TRIED"" -> 
   T in 1, R in 2 -> but we know R is not in position 2? Actually, we had R in position 2 and got a '-' meaning it's present but not in that position. So we should avoid putting R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So better to put R in a new position.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E.

 I think ""ROLES"" is a good candidate because:
   R is in position 1 (new for R)
   E is in position 4 (new for E, previously we had it in 5)
   We are testing O, L, S.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RICES"" but that has C and we know C is not in the word. So we must avoid C, A, N.

 Another word: ""ROUTE"" -> 
   R in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, E in 5 -> but E is in position 5 which we know is wrong. So avoid.

 How about ""RIPER""? But that has two R's and we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we have only one R so far. But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. Actually, the feedback might not account for duplicates properly. So it's better to avoid duplicates for now.

 Another idea: ""RISES"" -> but we have S twice? And we don't know if S is in the word. Also, R in position 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we are avoiding E in 5? Actually, E is in 4, which is good. But we have two S's. Let's avoid duplicates for now.

 How about ""ROBES""? 
   R in 1, O in 2, B in 3, E in 4, S in 5 -> E is in 4 (good) and S in 5 (new). But we are testing O and B.

 But note: we don't know if the word has O or B.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position and R in a different position, and also test other common letters.

 Another common word: ""TIGER"" -> 
   T in 1, I in 2, G in 3, E in 4, R in 5 -> 
   Here, R is in position 5 (which is new for R) and E is in position 4 (new for E). Also, we test T, I, G.

 But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. T, I, G are not in the forbidden list.

 However, we have to make sure the word is valid.

 Let me check: ""TIGER"" is a valid word.

 But wait: we are putting R in position 5 and E in position 4. We know from the first guess that E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is a good try. And R is not in position 2, so position 5 is a new position for R.

 So ""TIGER"" seems good.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RIPEN"" but that has N which we know is not in the word. So avoid.

 Another option: ""ROBES"" as above.

 But I think ""TIGER"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, G and places R and E in new positions.

 However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 Let's go with ""TIGER"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has the letter E in position 4? Then we get a check. Similarly for R in position 5.

 We are also testing three new letters: T, I, G.

 So, next guess: ""TIGER""

<guess>tiger</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.
- R is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R and E** (in positions other than 2 and 5, respectively).
- Must exclude C, A, N.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, G) to gather more information.

The word **""tiger""** fits these criteria:
- Places R in position 5 (new position for R).
- Places E in position 4 (new position for E).
- Tests new letters T, I, G.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).

<guess>tiger</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C: not in word
- R: in word but not position 2
- A: not in word
- N: not in word
- E: in word but not position 5

Guess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
- T: not in word
- I: not in word
- G: not in word
- E: correct and in position 4 (since we placed E in position 4 and got ✓)
- R: correct and in position 5 (since we placed R in position 5 and got ✓)

So now we know:
- The secret word has E in the fourth position and R in the fifth position. So the word ends with ""E R"".
- The third letter of the secret word is not G, and also not N (from first guess), and not I or any other eliminated letters.
- The first letter is not C, A, T, or G (all eliminated).
- Available letters: We know E and R are fixed at positions 4 and 5.

We also know from the first feedback that E is in the word (but not position 5, which we now know is position 4 fixed) and R is in the word (not position 2, and we now know it's in position 5).

The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ E R

We have eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G

Now, we need to guess a word that fits _ _ _ E R and uses only letters that haven't been eliminated. We know that the missing three letters cannot be C, A, N, T, I, G.

Also, from the first guess, we had R in position 2 as a wrong position (but now we know R is in position 5, so that's consistent). We also had E in position 5 as wrong (now fixed at 4).

So we are missing the first three letters.

We must avoid: C, A, N, T, I, G.

We also know that R and E are already placed correctly, so the first three letters must not be R or E? Actually, they can be other occurrences? 

But wait: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. In the feedback, we only got one R and one E marked. For example, in the first guess, we had only one R (at position 2) and one E (at position 5). Now in the second guess, we have E and R at positions 4 and 5 correct.

If there were duplicates, the feedback might not have shown them? Actually, the feedback would have shown duplicates. For instance, if the secret word had two R's, then if we guess one R in the correct position and one R in the wrong position, both would get marked accordingly. But in our case, we only have one R found. Similarly, only one E found.

So probably, there are no duplicates for R and E, meaning the first three letters are neither R nor E.

Therefore, we must choose a word with three distinct letters (not eliminated, and not E or R) for the first three positions.

Let's recall common English letters: We have vowels left: O, U. Consonants: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters to maximize information.

Let's form a word that ends with ""ER"".

We have to guess the first three letters.

Possible words: 
For example: LUMBER -> but we have U? And it's 6 letters? No, we need 5 letters: first three.

List some 5-letter words ending with ""ER"":

- Answer: AN?ER but A and N are eliminated, so not.
- UDDER: but U, D, D -> D is available? And we can try U and D.

But let's think of common words.

Actually, we need to use available letters.

We know the following letters are eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G.

So available: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid using letters that are very rare? But let's find a valid word.

We can consider:

- SOWER: S, O, W, E, R -> so pattern S O W E R -> positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:W

But we don't know if S, O, W are in the word.

Similarly, another word: ""POWER"" -> P, O, W, E, R.

Or ""LOWER"" -> L, O, W, E, R.

But we have multiple options. We need to choose one that tests letters we haven't tried.

Since we know positions 4 and 5 are fixed, we only need to get the first three.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that includes common letters that haven't been tested.

Already tested letters (in first two guesses): C, R, A, N, E, T, I, G.

So untested common letters: S, L, O, U, D, M, B, etc.

So we can try a word that has several of these.

For example, with S, O, and L: we have ""SOLER""? Is that a word? Soler is not common. No.

""SOBER"": S, O, B, E, R -> but E and R at 4 and 5 fixed? In ""SOBER"", E and R are at positions 4 and 5? Let's see:
S at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> perfect.

And S, O, B are letters we haven't tested yet.

Similarly, other words: ""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R -> V not tested.

But ""SOBER"" is a valid word meaning not intoxicated.

Another option: ""BOXER"", but we have X? Also, O and X.

But ""SOBER"" seems good.

Alternatively, ""MOWER"": M, O, W, E, R -> M, W not tested.

But ""SOBER"" tests S, O, B.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to get information.

Also, we must remember that the secret word must have the R and E, which we already have.

Now, are there any constraints from the first guess? 

In the first guess (crane), we had R at position 2 marked as present (but not placed). But now we have R at position 5. Since R is only present once, and now at 5, so that should be fine. The misplaced R at position 2 doesn't conflict because we have it at 5.

Similarly for E: in first guess E was at position 5 and misplaced, but now correctly placed at 4? 

Wait, no. In the secret word, E is at position 4, so in the first guess we put E at position 5, which is wrong. And now we have it at 4. So all consistent.

Therefore, a valid guess is ""SOBER"".

But we should consider that the first letter cannot be one of the eliminated? We must not use eliminated letters: so S, O, B are not eliminated (eliminated are C, A, N, T, I, G).

So ""SOBER"" uses S, O, B, all allowed.

Moreover, if we get feedback, we can see which letters are correct.

Another word: ""JOKER"" but J and K are less common. Also, J not eliminated? But we might avoid less common.

""SOBER"" seems good.

Another common word: ""SUPER"" -> S, U, P, E, R -> tests U and P.

But ""SOBER"" tests O and B as well.

I think ""SOBER"" is fine.

So we'll guess ""SOBER"".

But note: we have to be cautious. The word must have exactly the pattern _ _ _ E R.

So: <guess>sober</guess>Based on the feedback from ""crane"" and ""tiger"":
- E and R are confirmed in positions 4 and 5, respectively (word ends with ""ER"").
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G (confirmed absent from the secret word).
- The first three letters must use untested common letters (avoiding E and R duplicates).

The word **""sober""** fits perfectly:
- Tests **S**, **O**, and **B** (common letters not previously tried).
- Maintains E in position 4 and R in position 5.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

This choice will efficiently narrow down possibilities for positions 1–3 while leveraging known correct placements.

But let\'s find a valid word.\n\nWe can consider:\n\n- SOWER: S, O, W, E, R -> so pattern S O W E R -> positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:W\n\nBut we don\'t know if S, O, W are in the word.\n\nSimilarly, another word: ""POWER"" -> P, O, W, E, R.\n\nOr ""LOWER"" -> L, O, W, E, R.\n\nBut we have multiple options. We need to choose one that tests letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nSince we know positions 4 and 5 are fixed, we only need to get the first three.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that includes common letters that haven\'t been tested.\n\nAlready tested letters (in first two guesses): C, R, A, N, E, T, I, G.\n\nSo untested common letters: S, L, O, U, D, M, B, etc.\n\nSo we can try a word that has several of these.\n\nFor example, with S, O, and L: we have ""SOLER""? Is that a word? Soler is not common. No.\n\n""SOBER"": S, O, B, E, R -> but E and R at 4 and 5 fixed? In ""SOBER"", E and R are at positions 4 and 5? Let\'s see:\nS at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> perfect.\n\nAnd S, O, B are letters we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R -> V not tested.\n\nBut ""SOBER"" is a valid word meaning not intoxicated.\n\nAnother option: ""BOXER"", but we have X? Also, O and X.\n\nBut ""SOBER"" seems good.\n\nAlternatively, ""MOWER"": M, O, W, E, R -> M, W not tested.\n\nBut ""SOBER"" tests S, O, B.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we want to get information.\n\nAlso, we must remember that the secret word must have the R and E, which we already have.\n\nNow, are there any constraints from the first guess? \n\nIn the first guess (crane), we had R at position 2 marked as present (but not placed). But now we have R at position 5. Since R is only present once, and now at 5, so that should be fine. The misplaced R at position 2 doesn\'t conflict because we have it at 5.\n\nSimilarly for E: in first guess E was at position 5 and misplaced, but now correctly placed at 4? \n\nWait, no. In the secret word, E is at position 4, so in the first guess we put E at position 5, which is wrong. And now we have it at 4. So all consistent.\n\nTherefore, a valid guess is ""SOBER"".\n\nBut we should consider that the first letter cannot be one of the eliminated? We must not use eliminated letters: so S, O, B are not eliminated (eliminated are C, A, N, T, I, G).\n\nSo ""SOBER"" uses S, O, B, all allowed.\n\nMoreover, if we get feedback, we can see which letters are correct.\n\nAnother word: ""JOKER"" but J and K are less common. Also, J not eliminated? But we might avoid less common.\n\n""SOBER"" seems good.\n\nAnother common word: ""SUPER"" -> S, U, P, E, R -> tests U and P.\n\nBut ""SOBER"" tests O and B as well.\n\nI think ""SOBER"" is fine.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""SOBER"".\n\nBut note: we have to be cautious. The word must have exactly the pattern _ _ _ E R.\n\nSo: <guess>sober</guess>Based on the feedback from ""crane"" and ""tiger"":\n- E and R are confirmed in positions 4 and 5, respectively (word ends with ""ER"").\n- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G (confirmed absent from the secret word).\n- The first three letters must use untested common letters (avoiding E and R duplicates).\n\nThe word **""sober""** fits perfectly:\n- Tests **S**, **O**, and **B** (common letters not previously tried).\n- Maintains E in position 4 and R in position 5.\n- Avoids all eliminated letters.\n\nThis choice will efficiently narrow down possibilities for positions 1–3 while leveraging known correct placements.\n\n<guess>sober</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 3: sober -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C: absent
- R: present but wrong position (not position 2)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: present but wrong position (not position 5)

Guess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
- T: absent
- I: absent
- G: absent
- E: correct at position 4
- R: correct at position 5

So the secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. The word is _ _ _ E R.

Also, eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G.

Guess 3: sober -> Feedback: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
- S: absent
- O: correct at position 2 (since we put O in position 2 and it's marked correct)
- B: absent
- E: correct at position 4 (already known)
- R: correct at position 5 (already known)

Now, the secret word pattern is: _ O _ E R

We have:
- Position 2: O (now confirmed)
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

We need to find the first and third letters.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B (from guesses 1 and 3).

Also, we know that R and E are placed correctly, so the first and third positions cannot be R or E (unless duplicates, but feedback has not indicated any duplicates so far).

From guess 1, R was misplaced at position 2, but now we have O at position 2. Also, R is at position 5, so no duplicate R. Similarly, E is only at position 4.

So, the first and third positions must be letters that are not eliminated and not E, R, or O (since O is only in position 2).

Eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B.

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word with the pattern: _ O _ E R.

The word must be valid English word.

We are missing the first and third letters.

So, we can list possible words:

For example:
- HOVER: H O V E R -> V not tested, but H is available? H, O, V? H at pos1, V at pos3? But we have O at 2? 
  Pattern: H O V E R -> positions: 1:H, 3:V.

Similarly:
- MOVER: M O V E R -> M at 1, V at 3.
- LOVER: L O V E R -> L at 1, V at 3.
- ROVER? But R is already at position 5, and we must avoid duplicate R? But we don't know. Also, in this case, if we try R at position 1, but R is in the word? We have R at position 5, so if there's another R, it might appear.

But from feedback, we didn't see duplicate R. In the first guess (crane) we had R at position 2 and got a '-', which already confirms at least one R. In the second guess (tiger) we had R at position 5 and got ✓. In the third guess (sober) we had R again at position 5 and ✓. But we didn't try R in multiple positions at the same guess, so we don't know if duplicate exists.

In guess1, if there were two R's, then putting one R in position 2 (if there was one R in position 2) would show one ✓ if correct? But it wasn't.

Actually, the feedback would show each occurrence. For example, if the word had two R's, and we guess one in the wrong position, it would show '-', and if we guess one in the correct position, it would show '✓'. But we have not guessed R in any position other than 2 and 5. Position 2 had '-' meaning that position was wrong and there might be another R? But we now have R at position 5, so the R in position 2 was wrong, but that doesn't necessarily imply two R's. It could be one R that is at position 5 and was masked as misplaced in position 2.

Actually, Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, it might mark both accordingly? But in this case, if there had been two R's, in the second guess when we put R only in position 5, it should show only one ✓? And if there was an additional R not guessed, it wouldn't show? Actually, no. The feedback marks only for letters present. If a letter appears twice in the secret word, and you guess it once, it will show the feedback only for the one you guessed? But I think it marks every occurrence.

Recall: in Wordle, if the secret word has a duplicate letter, and you guess that letter in one position, it might be marked once if only one instance is present? Actually, the feedback goes by the letter counts. So to be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.

But for efficiency, we can guess without duplicates for now.

So, we are looking for words of the form: [first] O [third] E R, with first and third from available letters: D,F,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, common words:
- HOVER: uses H and V.
- LOVER: uses L and V.
- MOVER: uses M and V.
- POWER: but P and W? Also, available? P yes, W yes? But note: P and W not eliminated. ""POWER"": P O W E R -> positions: P:1, W:3.
- However, we have not eliminated W? So it's possible.

But wait, let's list:

Common possibilities:
- HOVER: H and V
- JOKER: but J and K? And O? Position 2 is O? But JOKER: J O K E R, so J at 1, K at 3? But K? We haven't eliminated K? Guess: J and K are available? K not tested? But note, ""tiger"" had G eliminated, but not K? And ""sober"" had B and S eliminated but not K? So K is still available? Wait, is K eliminated? We eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B. So K is available.

Similarly, U is available? For LOVER? L O V E R -> L and V available? L not eliminated? V not eliminated?

Valid words:

- POWER: P O W E R -> P at 1, W at 3
- BOXER: but B is eliminated? No, in ""sober"" we got B(x) -> absent, so B is eliminated. So we cannot use B.

Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B.

Available: D,F,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Words:

- LOVER: L O V E R -> L at 1, V at 3 -> valid
- MOVER: M O V E R -> M at 1, V at 3 -> valid
- HOVER: H O V E R -> H at 1, V at 3 -> valid
- POWER: P O W E R -> P at 1, W at 3 -> valid
- MOWER: M O W E R -> M at 1, W at 3 -> valid
- JOKER: J O K E R -> J at 1, K at 3 -> valid
- COVER: but C is eliminated? C in cover is first letter? Eliminated, cannot.
- ROVER: R O V E R -> R at 1? But we already have R at 5? So duplicate R? And R in position 1? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? We can try, but we don't get extra information? And if R appears twice, but from previous feedback we saw only one R marked each time? Actually, in ""tiger"", we had R only at position 5 and it was marked ✓, but if there was a duplicate R at position 1, it wouldn't be marked because we didn't guess it? So we don't know.

But ""ROVER"" has two R's? And if we try it, we might get information about duplicate.

But let's avoid for now? We can test one of the letters.

Since we have only two positions open, and we know the word, we can test one and next guess the other.

But we want to get it in as few guesses as possible.

Another word: ""FOWLER""? Too long.

Only 5 letters.

We have limited choices: first letter can be any available except O,E,R? And third letter any available except O,E,R.

We can choose words that test common letters? 

We need to guess both positions simultaneously? Because we have two guesses left? Wait, we have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 left? But we want to be efficient.

Given available letters, try to cover more common letters? For example, we haven't tested L, M, P, V, W, etc.

We can guess a word with L? Or M? Or more?

But we guess only one letter for each position? 

Since there are multiple possibilities, we can try a word that might help differentiate? 

But we need to pick a word that fits the pattern? Let's list possible words:

Possible words:
- HOVER
- JOKER
- LOVER
- MOVER
- POWER
- MOWER
- TOWER? But T is eliminated? T is gone, so no.

- DOVER? D O V E R -> D and V available? D? D not tested? Valid? Place name, I think.

But let's stick to common words.

- POWER, LOVER, MOVER are common.

We need to choose one? How about ""LOVER""? Uses L and V? Or ""MOVER""? or ""POWER""?

But we also have to avoid putting eliminated letters.

We can choose ""POWER"" to test P and W? Or ""LOVER"" to test L and V? Etc.

Now, if we choose ""POWER"" and the feedback shows P correct? Then we know P is at position1? But we are trying to get the first letter?

Similarly, we can choose a word that includes a vowel? But position1 and 3? Consonants or vowels.

Vowels left: U? And sometimes Y.

But we have U? Like in ""MOURNER""? Not 5 letters.

We can choose ""LOVER"", which uses L and V? Then if L is absent? Then we eliminate V? Or something?

But we get feedback per letter? Meaning:

If we guess ""LOVER"", feedback for:
- L: either ✓ if first position correct? or '-' if misplaced? or x if absent.
- O: already known and confirmed ✓ (we already know it's correct, so feedback for O will be ✓ again? but that's redundant).
- V: for third position?
- E and R: known ✓.

So we get new feedback for L and V.

Similarly for other guesses.

We can choose any word? But we must have O, E, R in positions 2,4,5.

So we can pick:

Option 1: ""LOVER"" -> guess: L O V E R
Then feedback:
- Position 1: L: will tell if L is in the word? And if at position 1?
- Position 3: V: similarly.

If L is ✓ at position1, we solved; if x, then L not present? But if it is misplaced? Then L is in the word but not at position 1? Then we have to use it in another position? But the only unknown positions are 1 and 3? And position 3 would be for V? But if L is misplaced? Then it should be at position 3? Which conflicts with V? Actually, we are putting L at position1 and V at position3. If L should be at position3, then we'd get L: '-' for position1, and V: x or etc.

But there are words: for example, if the word is ""MOVER"", then ""LOVER"" would have:
- L: x (since M at position1)
- V: ? 

But the secret word ""MOVER"": third letter is V? So for ""LOVER"" guessing on MOVER? Then:
- L at position1: absent? Secret has M at position1? So L:x? 
- V at position3: secret has V? At position3? So ✓? Then feedback: L(x), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓), R(✓)

And we know the first letter is wrong? Then next guess we try alternatives: M?

But we have a small list.

Similarly, if we guess ""LOVER"" and the feedback is:
- L: ✓? Then solved: LOVER is the word? Then all ✓? Or if L: '-'? Then L might be at position3? Then the word would have to be something like ? O L E R? For example, ""DOLLER""? Not a common word? Or ""POLER""? But P? Or ""DROLL""? Not pattern? So probably not?

But let's list words that end with O?ER? Actually, the pattern is first letter unknown, second O, third unknown, fourth E, fifth R.

So words: POWER, MOVER, HOVER, LOVER, JOKER, MOWER, COVER but C eliminated, DOVER, ROVER.

With ROVER: duplicate R? But possible? R at1 and R at5? Then the feedback for ""ROVER"" would have two ✓ for R? One at position1? And one at position5? But in previous guesses, when we had one R, it showed one? But now? Let's be cautious.

We already have R at position5, so R at position1 would be a duplicate? The secret word could be ""ROVER""?

But from the first guess: ""crane"" had R at position2? And feedback was '-'? Meaning there is an R not at position2? If the secret word is ""ROVER"", it has R at positions 1 and 5? Then in ""crane"", we guessed R at position2? Which is not correct? And R at position2? But secret has R at position1? Then feedback should have one '-' for R? Which it did? And the other R was not guessed? So it didn't show? So possible.

Similarly, E: only one? At position4? In ""ROVER"", E is at position4? So pattern matches.

So ""ROVER"" is a possibility? But R at position1? And in the first guess? We didn't guess position1? So how would we know? It's a possibility.

Similarly, other words.

But ""ROVER"" uses R? Which we haven't placed at position1? We eliminated? R is present? But we are putting it again? So it's a test.

To avoid duplicates? But sometimes Wordle allows duplicates.

Since we have eliminated many letters, the possibilities are:

Common words fitting the pattern:
- POWER (if P and W not eliminated)
- MOVER (M and V)
- LOVER (L and V)
- HOVER (H and V)
- JOKER (J and K)
- MOWER (M and W)
- DOVER (D and V) – Dover is a place name
- ROVER (duplicate R)

We also know from guess1 that R was misplaced at position2? But now in ROVER? R at position1: if we had guessed ""crane"" with R at2? Secret is ROVER: position1 R? And position5 R? So the R in ""crane"" position2? Compared to secret: position2 in secret is O? So no R there? So it is misplaced (should be position1)? So '-' is correct? And the duplicate R at position5? Not guessed? So no problem? So possible.

Similarly, is ""ROVER"" a valid word? Yes.

Now, we have to choose one word to guess.

We can choose a word that uses letters we haven't seen? And avoid rare letters? For example, ROVER uses R again? Which we already know? So it doesn't test new letters? Unless we want to confirm duplicate? But better to test new letters? Then POWER, LOVER, etc.

Given that we don't know L, V, M? Etc.

How about we guess ""MOVER""? Uses M and V? Both new.

Similarly, ""POWER"" uses P and W.

But we have used? Let's see feedback we can get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tries only one new letter? But that might not help? Because we have two positions.

The best is to pick one that we think is likely? But we don't have frequency.

We can choose ""POWER"" because P and W are common letters? Or ""LOVER""?

But note that we have two guesses left? So we can risk one possibility? 

Actually, we should maximize information? But the word might be one of these.

We know the third letter? In the pattern? We need to find it.

Let's look at guess1: we had E as present? But not at position5? But we have it at4? R as present? Not at2? But at5? So we didn't guess position1 and 3? So we can try any.

Option: guess ""JOKER""? J Q K? J rare? So probably not.

But let's be systematic.

We can eliminate by commonality? For example, ""HOVER"", ""MOVER"", ""POWER"", ""LOVER"", ""MOWER"" are common.

We don't know? How about ""LOVER"" as it has LV? Which are common.

But we can also see if there is a word that uses a letter we might have from before? Not really.

With six guesses, we have tries? We have used 3, so we have 3 left? But to be safe, we should try to solve.

We can guess ""POWER"" and see if we get PW.

So, i choose ""LOVER""? Let's don't.

Another constraint? From first guess: We had E misplaced? But in LOVER, E is at4? And that's fixed.

Similarly, all set.

I think ""MOVER"" is a good choice? Because M and V are common? Or perhaps ""POWER""?

But let's look at the available letters? We have P and W, both common.

""POWER"" is more common than ""MOVER""? According to frequency? But I don't know? 

To decide: we can choose ""POWER"" because if it's not that, we can try others?

So, let's guess ""POWER"".

Pattern: P O W E R

So, guess: <guess>power</guess> 

But we must check: P is not eliminated? W is not eliminated? Correct? Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B. So P and W are allowed.

And if feedback? For ""POWER"" guessed on, say, a secret word ""MOVER""? Then feedback:
- P: x? (since M at 1)
- O? ✓
- W: x? since V at 3? 
- E✓, R✓

But W not in the word? Then we know not POWER? Then next guess? But we have three positions? Only one and three? M and so we guess MOVER? Or similar.

Alternatively, if we guess ""LOVER"" and secret is ""MOVER"", then:
- L: x? 
- O✓
- V: but secret has V? At position3? Then ✓? So feedback: L(x), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> so we know the word is ? O V E R? With ? not L? So first letter could be H, M, etc? Then we guess MOVER? Then?

Similarly? I think ""POWER"" or ""LOVER"" are fine.

Let's go with ""POWER"".
</think>
From the feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in position 4 and **R** in position 5 (word ends with ""ER"").
- **O** is now confirmed in position 2, so the word pattern is **? O ? E R**.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B (absent from the word).
- Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

This leaves the first and third positions to be solved. Common words fitting the pattern include:
- **POWER**: Tests **P** and **W** (both untested common letters).  
- **LOVER**: Tests **L** and **V**.  
- **MOVER**: Tests **M** and **V**.  
- **HOVER**: Tests **H** and **V**.  

Guessing **""POWER""** maximizes information by:
- Testing **P** (position 1) and **W** (position 3), which are high-frequency consonants.  
- Covering the pattern without duplicates (since duplicate R isn't indicated by feedback).  

If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., LOVER/MOVER) efficiently.

<guess>power</guess>",power,"We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C: absent
- R: present but wrong position (not position 2)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: present but wrong position (not position 5)

Guess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
- T: absent
- I: absent
- G: absent
- E: correct at position 4
- R: correct at position 5

So the secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. The word is _ _ _ E R.

Also, eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G.

Guess 3: sober -> Feedback: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
- S: absent
- O: correct at position 2 (since we put O in position 2 and it's marked correct)
- B: absent
- E: correct at position 4 (already known)
- R: correct at position 5 (already known)

Now, the secret word pattern is: _ O _ E R

We have:
- Position 2: O (now confirmed)
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

We need to find the first and third letters.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B (from guesses 1 and 3).

Also, we know that R and E are placed correctly, so the first and third positions cannot be R or E (unless duplicates, but feedback has not indicated any duplicates so far).

From guess 1, R was misplaced at position 2, but now we have O at position 2. Also, R is at position 5, so no duplicate R. Similarly, E is only at position 4.

So, the first and third positions must be letters that are not eliminated and not E, R, or O (since O is only in position 2).

Eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B.

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word with the pattern: _ O _ E R.

The word must be valid English word.

We are missing the first and third letters.

So, we can list possible words:

For example:
- HOVER: H O V E R -> V not tested, but H is available? H, O, V? H at pos1, V at pos3? But we have O at 2? 
  Pattern: H O V E R -> positions: 1:H, 3:V.

Similarly:
- MOVER: M O V E R -> M at 1, V at 3.
- LOVER: L O V E R -> L at 1, V at 3.
- ROVER? But R is already at position 5, and we must avoid duplicate R? But we don't know. Also, in this case, if we try R at position 1, but R is in the word? We have R at position 5, so if there's another R, it might appear.

But from feedback, we didn't see duplicate R. In the first guess (crane) we had R at position 2 and got a '-', which already confirms at least one R. In the second guess (tiger) we had R at position 5 and got ✓. In the third guess (sober) we had R again at position 5 and ✓. But we didn't try R in multiple positions at the same guess, so we don't know if duplicate exists.

In guess1, if there were two R's, then putting one R in position 2 (if there was one R in position 2) would show one ✓ if correct? But it wasn't.

Actually, the feedback would show each occurrence. For example, if the word had two R's, and we guess one in the wrong position, it would show '-', and if we guess one in the correct position, it would show '✓'. But we have not guessed R in any position other than 2 and 5. Position 2 had '-' meaning that position was wrong and there might be another R? But we now have R at position 5, so the R in position 2 was wrong, but that doesn't necessarily imply two R's. It could be one R that is at position 5 and was masked as misplaced in position 2.

Actually, Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, it might mark both accordingly? But in this case, if there had been two R's, in the second guess when we put R only in position 5, it should show only one ✓? And if there was an additional R not guessed, it wouldn't show? Actually, no. The feedback marks only for letters present. If a letter appears twice in the secret word, and you guess it once, it will show the feedback only for the one you guessed? But I think it marks every occurrence.

Recall: in Wordle, if the secret word has a duplicate letter, and you guess that letter in one position, it might be marked once if only one instance is present? Actually, the feedback goes by the letter counts. So to be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.

But for efficiency, we can guess without duplicates for now.

So, we are looking for words of the form: [first] O [third] E R, with first and third from available letters: D,F,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, common words:
- HOVER: uses H and V.
- LOVER: uses L and V.
- MOVER: uses M and V.
- POWER: but P and W? Also, available? P yes, W yes? But note: P and W not eliminated. ""POWER"": P O W E R -> positions: P:1, W:3.
- However, we have not eliminated W? So it's possible.

But wait, let's list:

Common possibilities:
- HOVER: H and V
- JOKER: but J and K? And O? Position 2 is O? But JOKER: J O K E R, so J at 1, K at 3? But K? We haven't eliminated K? Guess: J and K are available? K not tested? But note, ""tiger"" had G eliminated, but not K? And ""sober"" had B and S eliminated but not K? So K is still available? Wait, is K eliminated? We eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B. So K is available.

Similarly, U is available? For LOVER? L O V E R -> L and V available? L not eliminated? V not eliminated?

Valid words:

- POWER: P O W E R -> P at 1, W at 3
- BOXER: but B is eliminated? No, in ""sober"" we got B(x) -> absent, so B is eliminated. So we cannot use B.

Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B.

Available: D,F,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Words:

- LOVER: L O V E R -> L at 1, V at 3 -> valid
- MOVER: M O V E R -> M at 1, V at 3 -> valid
- HOVER: H O V E R -> H at 1, V at 3 -> valid
- POWER: P O W E R -> P at 1, W at 3 -> valid
- MOWER: M O W E R -> M at 1, W at 3 -> valid
- JOKER: J O K E R -> J at 1, K at 3 -> valid
- COVER: but C is eliminated? C in cover is first letter? Eliminated, cannot.
- ROVER: R O V E R -> R at 1? But we already have R at 5? So duplicate R? And R in position 1? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? We can try, but we don't get extra information? And if R appears twice, but from previous feedback we saw only one R marked each time? Actually, in ""tiger"", we had R only at position 5 and it was marked ✓, but if there was a duplicate R at position 1, it wouldn't be marked because we didn't guess it? So we don't know.

But ""ROVER"" has two R's? And if we try it, we might get information about duplicate.

But let's avoid for now? We can test one of the letters.

Since we have only two positions open, and we know the word, we can test one and next guess the other.

But we want to get it in as few guesses as possible.

Another word: ""FOWLER""? Too long.

Only 5 letters.

We have limited choices: first letter can be any available except O,E,R? And third letter any available except O,E,R.

We can choose words that test common letters? 

We need to guess both positions simultaneously? Because we have two guesses left? Wait, we have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 left? But we want to be efficient.

Given available letters, try to cover more common letters? For example, we haven't tested L, M, P, V, W, etc.

We can guess a word with L? Or M? Or more?

But we guess only one letter for each position? 

Since there are multiple possibilities, we can try a word that might help differentiate? 

But we need to pick a word that fits the pattern? Let's list possible words:

Possible words:
- HOVER
- JOKER
- LOVER
- MOVER
- POWER
- MOWER
- TOWER? But T is eliminated? T is gone, so no.

- DOVER? D O V E R -> D and V available? D? D not tested? Valid? Place name, I think.

But let's stick to common words.

- POWER, LOVER, MOVER are common.

We need to choose one? How about ""LOVER""? Uses L and V? Or ""MOVER""? or ""POWER""?

But we also have to avoid putting eliminated letters.

We can choose ""POWER"" to test P and W? Or ""LOVER"" to test L and V? Etc.

Now, if we choose ""POWER"" and the feedback shows P correct? Then we know P is at position1? But we are trying to get the first letter?

Similarly, we can choose a word that includes a vowel? But position1 and 3? Consonants or vowels.

Vowels left: U? And sometimes Y.

But we have U? Like in ""MOURNER""? Not 5 letters.

We can choose ""LOVER"", which uses L and V? Then if L is absent? Then we eliminate V? Or something?

But we get feedback per letter? Meaning:

If we guess ""LOVER"", feedback for:
- L: either ✓ if first position correct? or '-' if misplaced? or x if absent.
- O: already known and confirmed ✓ (we already know it's correct, so feedback for O will be ✓ again? but that's redundant).
- V: for third position?
- E and R: known ✓.

So we get new feedback for L and V.

Similarly for other guesses.

We can choose any word? But we must have O, E, R in positions 2,4,5.

So we can pick:

Option 1: ""LOVER"" -> guess: L O V E R
Then feedback:
- Position 1: L: will tell if L is in the word? And if at position 1?
- Position 3: V: similarly.

If L is ✓ at position1, we solved; if x, then L not present? But if it is misplaced? Then L is in the word but not at position 1? Then we have to use it in another position? But the only unknown positions are 1 and 3? And position 3 would be for V? But if L is misplaced? Then it should be at position 3? Which conflicts with V? Actually, we are putting L at position1 and V at position3. If L should be at position3, then we'd get L: '-' for position1, and V: x or etc.

But there are words: for example, if the word is ""MOVER"", then ""LOVER"" would have:
- L: x (since M at position1)
- V: ? 

But the secret word ""MOVER"": third letter is V? So for ""LOVER"" guessing on MOVER? Then:
- L at position1: absent? Secret has M at position1? So L:x? 
- V at position3: secret has V? At position3? So ✓? Then feedback: L(x), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓), R(✓)

And we know the first letter is wrong? Then next guess we try alternatives: M?

But we have a small list.

Similarly, if we guess ""LOVER"" and the feedback is:
- L: ✓? Then solved: LOVER is the word? Then all ✓? Or if L: '-'? Then L might be at position3? Then the word would have to be something like ? O L E R? For example, ""DOLLER""? Not a common word? Or ""POLER""? But P? Or ""DROLL""? Not pattern? So probably not?

But let's list words that end with O?ER? Actually, the pattern is first letter unknown, second O, third unknown, fourth E, fifth R.

So words: POWER, MOVER, HOVER, LOVER, JOKER, MOWER, COVER but C eliminated, DOVER, ROVER.

With ROVER: duplicate R? But possible? R at1 and R at5? Then the feedback for ""ROVER"" would have two ✓ for R? One at position1? And one at position5? But in previous guesses, when we had one R, it showed one? But now? Let's be cautious.

We already have R at position5, so R at position1 would be a duplicate? The secret word could be ""ROVER""?

But from the first guess: ""crane"" had R at position2? And feedback was '-'? Meaning there is an R not at position2? If the secret word is ""ROVER"", it has R at positions 1 and 5? Then in ""crane"", we guessed R at position2? Which is not correct? And R at position2? But secret has R at position1? Then feedback should have one '-' for R? Which it did? And the other R was not guessed? So it didn't show? So possible.

Similarly, E: only one? At position4? In ""ROVER"", E is at position4? So pattern matches.

So ""ROVER"" is a possibility? But R at position1? And in the first guess? We didn't guess position1? So how would we know? It's a possibility.

Similarly, other words.

But ""ROVER"" uses R? Which we haven't placed at position1? We eliminated? R is present? But we are putting it again? So it's a test.

To avoid duplicates? But sometimes Wordle allows duplicates.

Since we have eliminated many letters, the possibilities are:

Common words fitting the pattern:
- POWER (if P and W not eliminated)
- MOVER (M and V)
- LOVER (L and V)
- HOVER (H and V)
- JOKER (J and K)
- MOWER (M and W)
- DOVER (D and V) – Dover is a place name
- ROVER (duplicate R)

We also know from guess1 that R was misplaced at position2? But now in ROVER? R at position1: if we had guessed ""crane"" with R at2? Secret is ROVER: position1 R? And position5 R? So the R in ""crane"" position2? Compared to secret: position2 in secret is O? So no R there? So it is misplaced (should be position1)? So '-' is correct? And the duplicate R at position5? Not guessed? So no problem? So possible.

Similarly, is ""ROVER"" a valid word? Yes.

Now, we have to choose one word to guess.

We can choose a word that uses letters we haven't seen? And avoid rare letters? For example, ROVER uses R again? Which we already know? So it doesn't test new letters? Unless we want to confirm duplicate? But better to test new letters? Then POWER, LOVER, etc.

Given that we don't know L, V, M? Etc.

How about we guess ""MOVER""? Uses M and V? Both new.

Similarly, ""POWER"" uses P and W.

But we have used? Let's see feedback we can get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tries only one new letter? But that might not help? Because we have two positions.

The best is to pick one that we think is likely? But we don't have frequency.

We can choose ""POWER"" because P and W are common letters? Or ""LOVER""?

But note that we have two guesses left? So we can risk one possibility? 

Actually, we should maximize information? But the word might be one of these.

We know the third letter? In the pattern? We need to find it.

Let's look at guess1: we had E as present? But not at position5? But we have it at4? R as present? Not at2? But at5? So we didn't guess position1 and 3? So we can try any.

Option: guess ""JOKER""? J Q K? J rare? So probably not.

But let's be systematic.

We can eliminate by commonality? For example, ""HOVER"", ""MOVER"", ""POWER"", ""LOVER"", ""MOWER"" are common.

We don't know? How about ""LOVER"" as it has LV? Which are common.

But we can also see if there is a word that uses a letter we might have from before? Not really.

With six guesses, we have tries? We have used 3, so we have 3 left? But to be safe, we should try to solve.

We can guess ""POWER"" and see if we get PW.

So, i choose ""LOVER""? Let's don't.

Another constraint? From first guess: We had E misplaced? But in LOVER, E is at4? And that's fixed.

Similarly, all set.

I think ""MOVER"" is a good choice? Because M and V are common? Or perhaps ""POWER""?

But let's look at the available letters? We have P and W, both common.

""POWER"" is more common than ""MOVER""? According to frequency? But I don't know? 

To decide: we can choose ""POWER"" because if it's not that, we can try others?

So, let's guess ""POWER"".

Pattern: P O W E R

So, guess: <guess>power</guess> 

But we must check: P is not eliminated? W is not eliminated? Correct? Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B. So P and W are allowed.

And if feedback? For ""POWER"" guessed on, say, a secret word ""MOVER""? Then feedback:
- P: x? (since M at 1)
- O? ✓
- W: x? since V at 3? 
- E✓, R✓

But W not in the word? Then we know not POWER? Then next guess? But we have three positions? Only one and three? M and so we guess MOVER? Or similar.

Alternatively, if we guess ""LOVER"" and secret is ""MOVER"", then:
- L: x? 
- O✓
- V: but secret has V? At position3? Then ✓? So feedback: L(x), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> so we know the word is ? O V E R? With ? not L? So first letter could be H, M, etc? Then we guess MOVER? Then?

Similarly? I think ""POWER"" or ""LOVER"" are fine.

Let's go with ""POWER"".From the feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in position 4 and **R** in position 5 (word ends with ""ER"").
- **O** is now confirmed in position 2, so the word pattern is **? O ? E R**.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B (absent from the word).
- Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

This leaves the first and third positions to be solved. Common words fitting the pattern include:
- **POWER**: Tests **P** and **W** (both untested common letters).  
- **LOVER**: Tests **L** and **V**.  
- **MOVER**: Tests **M** and **V**.  
- **HOVER**: Tests **H** and **V**.  

Guessing **""POWER""** maximizes information by:
- Testing **P** (position 1) and **W** (position 3), which are high-frequency consonants.  
- Covering the pattern without duplicates (since duplicate R isn't indicated by feedback).  

If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., LOVER/MOVER) efficiently.",Guess 4: power -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,ROWER,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, since we have three incorrect letters (C, A, N) and two correct letters (R and E) but in the wrong positions, we can use this to form our next guess.

 Important: The secret word must contain R and E, but not C, A, N.

 Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 1. Does not contain C, A, N.
 2. Contains R and E (but not in the positions we already tried for them? Actually, we know R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5, but they could be in other positions).

 We also want to try to place R and E in new positions and include other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think about the positions:
 - R was in position 2 in ""crane"" -> so in the secret word, R is not in position 2. Therefore, R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 - E was in position 5 in ""crane"" -> so in the secret word, E is not in position 5. Therefore, E must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We can also consider that the word has 5 letters and we have two of them (R and E) but we don't know the other three.

 Since we have eliminated C, A, N, we can avoid those.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and E, and uses other common letters (like S, T, L, O, etc.) and that doesn't have C, A, N.

 We also want to try to place R and E in positions we haven't tried for them. For example, we can try R in position 1, 3, or 4 and E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not the same as R).

 Some words that come to mind:

 Option 1: ""ROLES"" -> 
   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R, since previously we had it in position 2 and now we try position 1)
   O is a new letter
   L is new
   E in position 4 (previously we had E in position 5, so position 4 is new for E)
   S is new

 But note: we don't know if O, L, S are in the word or not.

 Option 2: ""STORE"" -> 
   S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, R in 4, E in 5 -> but wait, we know E is not in position 5 (from previous feedback). So we cannot put E in position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting E in position 5.

 So let's avoid putting E in position 5 and R in position 2.

 Another option: ""TRIED"" -> 
   T in 1, R in 2 -> but we know R is not in position 2? Actually, we had R in position 2 and got a '-' meaning it's present but not in that position. So we should avoid putting R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So better to put R in a new position.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E.

 I think ""ROLES"" is a good candidate because:
   R is in position 1 (new for R)
   E is in position 4 (new for E, previously we had it in 5)
   We are testing O, L, S.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RICES"" but that has C and we know C is not in the word. So we must avoid C, A, N.

 Another word: ""ROUTE"" -> 
   R in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, E in 5 -> but E is in position 5 which we know is wrong. So avoid.

 How about ""RIPER""? But that has two R's and we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we have only one R so far. But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. Actually, the feedback might not account for duplicates properly. So it's better to avoid duplicates for now.

 Another idea: ""RISES"" -> but we have S twice? And we don't know if S is in the word. Also, R in position 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we are avoiding E in 5? Actually, E is in 4, which is good. But we have two S's. Let's avoid duplicates for now.

 How about ""ROBES""? 
   R in 1, O in 2, B in 3, E in 4, S in 5 -> E is in 4 (good) and S in 5 (new). But we are testing O and B.

 But note: we don't know if the word has O or B.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position and R in a different position, and also test other common letters.

 Another common word: ""TIGER"" -> 
   T in 1, I in 2, G in 3, E in 4, R in 5 -> 
   Here, R is in position 5 (which is new for R) and E is in position 4 (new for E). Also, we test T, I, G.

 But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. T, I, G are not in the forbidden list.

 However, we have to make sure the word is valid.

 Let me check: ""TIGER"" is a valid word.

 But wait: we are putting R in position 5 and E in position 4. We know from the first guess that E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is a good try. And R is not in position 2, so position 5 is a new position for R.

 So ""TIGER"" seems good.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RIPEN"" but that has N which we know is not in the word. So avoid.

 Another option: ""ROBES"" as above.

 But I think ""TIGER"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, G and places R and E in new positions.

 However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 Let's go with ""TIGER"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has the letter E in position 4? Then we get a check. Similarly for R in position 5.

 We are also testing three new letters: T, I, G.

 So, next guess: ""TIGER""

<guess>tiger</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.
- R is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R and E** (in positions other than 2 and 5, respectively).
- Must exclude C, A, N.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, G) to gather more information.

The word **""tiger""** fits these criteria:
- Places R in position 5 (new position for R).
- Places E in position 4 (new position for E).
- Tests new letters T, I, G.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).

<guess>tiger</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C: not in word
- R: in word but not position 2
- A: not in word
- N: not in word
- E: in word but not position 5

Guess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
- T: not in word
- I: not in word
- G: not in word
- E: correct and in position 4 (since we placed E in position 4 and got ✓)
- R: correct and in position 5 (since we placed R in position 5 and got ✓)

So now we know:
- The secret word has E in the fourth position and R in the fifth position. So the word ends with ""E R"".
- The third letter of the secret word is not G, and also not N (from first guess), and not I or any other eliminated letters.
- The first letter is not C, A, T, or G (all eliminated).
- Available letters: We know E and R are fixed at positions 4 and 5.

We also know from the first feedback that E is in the word (but not position 5, which we now know is position 4 fixed) and R is in the word (not position 2, and we now know it's in position 5).

The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ E R

We have eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G

Now, we need to guess a word that fits _ _ _ E R and uses only letters that haven't been eliminated. We know that the missing three letters cannot be C, A, N, T, I, G.

Also, from the first guess, we had R in position 2 as a wrong position (but now we know R is in position 5, so that's consistent). We also had E in position 5 as wrong (now fixed at 4).

So we are missing the first three letters.

We must avoid: C, A, N, T, I, G.

We also know that R and E are already placed correctly, so the first three letters must not be R or E? Actually, they can be other occurrences? 

But wait: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. In the feedback, we only got one R and one E marked. For example, in the first guess, we had only one R (at position 2) and one E (at position 5). Now in the second guess, we have E and R at positions 4 and 5 correct.

If there were duplicates, the feedback might not have shown them? Actually, the feedback would have shown duplicates. For instance, if the secret word had two R's, then if we guess one R in the correct position and one R in the wrong position, both would get marked accordingly. But in our case, we only have one R found. Similarly, only one E found.

So probably, there are no duplicates for R and E, meaning the first three letters are neither R nor E.

Therefore, we must choose a word with three distinct letters (not eliminated, and not E or R) for the first three positions.

Let's recall common English letters: We have vowels left: O, U. Consonants: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters to maximize information.

Let's form a word that ends with ""ER"".

We have to guess the first three letters.

Possible words: 
For example: LUMBER -> but we have U? And it's 6 letters? No, we need 5 letters: first three.

List some 5-letter words ending with ""ER"":

- Answer: AN?ER but A and N are eliminated, so not.
- UDDER: but U, D, D -> D is available? And we can try U and D.

But let's think of common words.

Actually, we need to use available letters.

We know the following letters are eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G.

So available: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid using letters that are very rare? But let's find a valid word.

We can consider:

- SOWER: S, O, W, E, R -> so pattern S O W E R -> positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:W

But we don't know if S, O, W are in the word.

Similarly, another word: ""POWER"" -> P, O, W, E, R.

Or ""LOWER"" -> L, O, W, E, R.

But we have multiple options. We need to choose one that tests letters we haven't tried.

Since we know positions 4 and 5 are fixed, we only need to get the first three.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that includes common letters that haven't been tested.

Already tested letters (in first two guesses): C, R, A, N, E, T, I, G.

So untested common letters: S, L, O, U, D, M, B, etc.

So we can try a word that has several of these.

For example, with S, O, and L: we have ""SOLER""? Is that a word? Soler is not common. No.

""SOBER"": S, O, B, E, R -> but E and R at 4 and 5 fixed? In ""SOBER"", E and R are at positions 4 and 5? Let's see:
S at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> perfect.

And S, O, B are letters we haven't tested yet.

Similarly, other words: ""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R -> V not tested.

But ""SOBER"" is a valid word meaning not intoxicated.

Another option: ""BOXER"", but we have X? Also, O and X.

But ""SOBER"" seems good.

Alternatively, ""MOWER"": M, O, W, E, R -> M, W not tested.

But ""SOBER"" tests S, O, B.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to get information.

Also, we must remember that the secret word must have the R and E, which we already have.

Now, are there any constraints from the first guess? 

In the first guess (crane), we had R at position 2 marked as present (but not placed). But now we have R at position 5. Since R is only present once, and now at 5, so that should be fine. The misplaced R at position 2 doesn't conflict because we have it at 5.

Similarly for E: in first guess E was at position 5 and misplaced, but now correctly placed at 4? 

Wait, no. In the secret word, E is at position 4, so in the first guess we put E at position 5, which is wrong. And now we have it at 4. So all consistent.

Therefore, a valid guess is ""SOBER"".

But we should consider that the first letter cannot be one of the eliminated? We must not use eliminated letters: so S, O, B are not eliminated (eliminated are C, A, N, T, I, G).

So ""SOBER"" uses S, O, B, all allowed.

Moreover, if we get feedback, we can see which letters are correct.

Another word: ""JOKER"" but J and K are less common. Also, J not eliminated? But we might avoid less common.

""SOBER"" seems good.

Another common word: ""SUPER"" -> S, U, P, E, R -> tests U and P.

But ""SOBER"" tests O and B as well.

I think ""SOBER"" is fine.

So we'll guess ""SOBER"".

But note: we have to be cautious. The word must have exactly the pattern _ _ _ E R.

So: <guess>sober</guess>Based on the feedback from ""crane"" and ""tiger"":
- E and R are confirmed in positions 4 and 5, respectively (word ends with ""ER"").
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G (confirmed absent from the secret word).
- The first three letters must use untested common letters (avoiding E and R duplicates).

The word **""sober""** fits perfectly:
- Tests **S**, **O**, and **B** (common letters not previously tried).
- Maintains E in position 4 and R in position 5.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

This choice will efficiently narrow down possibilities for positions 1–3 while leveraging known correct placements.

<guess>sober</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 3: sober -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C: absent
- R: present but wrong position (not position 2)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: present but wrong position (not position 5)

Guess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
- T: absent
- I: absent
- G: absent
- E: correct at position 4
- R: correct at position 5

So the secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. The word is _ _ _ E R.

Also, eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G.

Guess 3: sober -> Feedback: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
- S: absent
- O: correct at position 2 (since we put O in position 2 and it's marked correct)
- B: absent
- E: correct at position 4 (already known)
- R: correct at position 5 (already known)

Now, the secret word pattern is: _ O _ E R

We have:
- Position 2: O (now confirmed)
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

We need to find the first and third letters.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B (from guesses 1 and 3).

Also, we know that R and E are placed correctly, so the first and third positions cannot be R or E (unless duplicates, but feedback has not indicated any duplicates so far).

From guess 1, R was misplaced at position 2, but now we have O at position 2. Also, R is at position 5, so no duplicate R. Similarly, E is only at position 4.

So, the first and third positions must be letters that are not eliminated and not E, R, or O (since O is only in position 2).

Eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B.

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word with the pattern: _ O _ E R.

The word must be valid English word.

We are missing the first and third letters.

So, we can list possible words:

For example:
- HOVER: H O V E R -> V not tested, but H is available? H, O, V? H at pos1, V at pos3? But we have O at 2? 
  Pattern: H O V E R -> positions: 1:H, 3:V.

Similarly:
- MOVER: M O V E R -> M at 1, V at 3.
- LOVER: L O V E R -> L at 1, V at 3.
- ROVER? But R is already at position 5, and we must avoid duplicate R? But we don't know. Also, in this case, if we try R at position 1, but R is in the word? We have R at position 5, so if there's another R, it might appear.

But from feedback, we didn't see duplicate R. In the first guess (crane) we had R at position 2 and got a '-', which already confirms at least one R. In the second guess (tiger) we had R at position 5 and got ✓. In the third guess (sober) we had R again at position 5 and ✓. But we didn't try R in multiple positions at the same guess, so we don't know if duplicate exists.

In guess1, if there were two R's, then putting one R in position 2 (if there was one R in position 2) would show one ✓ if correct? But it wasn't.

Actually, the feedback would show each occurrence. For example, if the word had two R's, and we guess one in the wrong position, it would show '-', and if we guess one in the correct position, it would show '✓'. But we have not guessed R in any position other than 2 and 5. Position 2 had '-' meaning that position was wrong and there might be another R? But we now have R at position 5, so the R in position 2 was wrong, but that doesn't necessarily imply two R's. It could be one R that is at position 5 and was masked as misplaced in position 2.

Actually, Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, it might mark both accordingly? But in this case, if there had been two R's, in the second guess when we put R only in position 5, it should show only one ✓? And if there was an additional R not guessed, it wouldn't show? Actually, no. The feedback marks only for letters present. If a letter appears twice in the secret word, and you guess it once, it will show the feedback only for the one you guessed? But I think it marks every occurrence.

Recall: in Wordle, if the secret word has a duplicate letter, and you guess that letter in one position, it might be marked once if only one instance is present? Actually, the feedback goes by the letter counts. So to be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.

But for efficiency, we can guess without duplicates for now.

So, we are looking for words of the form: [first] O [third] E R, with first and third from available letters: D,F,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, common words:
- HOVER: uses H and V.
- LOVER: uses L and V.
- MOVER: uses M and V.
- POWER: but P and W? Also, available? P yes, W yes? But note: P and W not eliminated. ""POWER"": P O W E R -> positions: P:1, W:3.
- However, we have not eliminated W? So it's possible.

But wait, let's list:

Common possibilities:
- HOVER: H and V
- JOKER: but J and K? And O? Position 2 is O? But JOKER: J O K E R, so J at 1, K at 3? But K? We haven't eliminated K? Guess: J and K are available? K not tested? But note, ""tiger"" had G eliminated, but not K? And ""sober"" had B and S eliminated but not K? So K is still available? Wait, is K eliminated? We eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B. So K is available.

Similarly, U is available? For LOVER? L O V E R -> L and V available? L not eliminated? V not eliminated?

Valid words:

- POWER: P O W E R -> P at 1, W at 3
- BOXER: but B is eliminated? No, in ""sober"" we got B(x) -> absent, so B is eliminated. So we cannot use B.

Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B.

Available: D,F,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Words:

- LOVER: L O V E R -> L at 1, V at 3 -> valid
- MOVER: M O V E R -> M at 1, V at 3 -> valid
- HOVER: H O V E R -> H at 1, V at 3 -> valid
- POWER: P O W E R -> P at 1, W at 3 -> valid
- MOWER: M O W E R -> M at 1, W at 3 -> valid
- JOKER: J O K E R -> J at 1, K at 3 -> valid
- COVER: but C is eliminated? C in cover is first letter? Eliminated, cannot.
- ROVER: R O V E R -> R at 1? But we already have R at 5? So duplicate R? And R in position 1? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? We can try, but we don't get extra information? And if R appears twice, but from previous feedback we saw only one R marked each time? Actually, in ""tiger"", we had R only at position 5 and it was marked ✓, but if there was a duplicate R at position 1, it wouldn't be marked because we didn't guess it? So we don't know.

But ""ROVER"" has two R's? And if we try it, we might get information about duplicate.

But let's avoid for now? We can test one of the letters.

Since we have only two positions open, and we know the word, we can test one and next guess the other.

But we want to get it in as few guesses as possible.

Another word: ""FOWLER""? Too long.

Only 5 letters.

We have limited choices: first letter can be any available except O,E,R? And third letter any available except O,E,R.

We can choose words that test common letters? 

We need to guess both positions simultaneously? Because we have two guesses left? Wait, we have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 left? But we want to be efficient.

Given available letters, try to cover more common letters? For example, we haven't tested L, M, P, V, W, etc.

We can guess a word with L? Or M? Or more?

But we guess only one letter for each position? 

Since there are multiple possibilities, we can try a word that might help differentiate? 

But we need to pick a word that fits the pattern? Let's list possible words:

Possible words:
- HOVER
- JOKER
- LOVER
- MOVER
- POWER
- MOWER
- TOWER? But T is eliminated? T is gone, so no.

- DOVER? D O V E R -> D and V available? D? D not tested? Valid? Place name, I think.

But let's stick to common words.

- POWER, LOVER, MOVER are common.

We need to choose one? How about ""LOVER""? Uses L and V? Or ""MOVER""? or ""POWER""?

But we also have to avoid putting eliminated letters.

We can choose ""POWER"" to test P and W? Or ""LOVER"" to test L and V? Etc.

Now, if we choose ""POWER"" and the feedback shows P correct? Then we know P is at position1? But we are trying to get the first letter?

Similarly, we can choose a word that includes a vowel? But position1 and 3? Consonants or vowels.

Vowels left: U? And sometimes Y.

But we have U? Like in ""MOURNER""? Not 5 letters.

We can choose ""LOVER"", which uses L and V? Then if L is absent? Then we eliminate V? Or something?

But we get feedback per letter? Meaning:

If we guess ""LOVER"", feedback for:
- L: either ✓ if first position correct? or '-' if misplaced? or x if absent.
- O: already known and confirmed ✓ (we already know it's correct, so feedback for O will be ✓ again? but that's redundant).
- V: for third position?
- E and R: known ✓.

So we get new feedback for L and V.

Similarly for other guesses.

We can choose any word? But we must have O, E, R in positions 2,4,5.

So we can pick:

Option 1: ""LOVER"" -> guess: L O V E R
Then feedback:
- Position 1: L: will tell if L is in the word? And if at position 1?
- Position 3: V: similarly.

If L is ✓ at position1, we solved; if x, then L not present? But if it is misplaced? Then L is in the word but not at position 1? Then we have to use it in another position? But the only unknown positions are 1 and 3? And position 3 would be for V? But if L is misplaced? Then it should be at position 3? Which conflicts with V? Actually, we are putting L at position1 and V at position3. If L should be at position3, then we'd get L: '-' for position1, and V: x or etc.

But there are words: for example, if the word is ""MOVER"", then ""LOVER"" would have:
- L: x (since M at position1)
- V: ? 

But the secret word ""MOVER"": third letter is V? So for ""LOVER"" guessing on MOVER? Then:
- L at position1: absent? Secret has M at position1? So L:x? 
- V at position3: secret has V? At position3? So ✓? Then feedback: L(x), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓), R(✓)

And we know the first letter is wrong? Then next guess we try alternatives: M?

But we have a small list.

Similarly, if we guess ""LOVER"" and the feedback is:
- L: ✓? Then solved: LOVER is the word? Then all ✓? Or if L: '-'? Then L might be at position3? Then the word would have to be something like ? O L E R? For example, ""DOLLER""? Not a common word? Or ""POLER""? But P? Or ""DROLL""? Not pattern? So probably not?

But let's list words that end with O?ER? Actually, the pattern is first letter unknown, second O, third unknown, fourth E, fifth R.

So words: POWER, MOVER, HOVER, LOVER, JOKER, MOWER, COVER but C eliminated, DOVER, ROVER.

With ROVER: duplicate R? But possible? R at1 and R at5? Then the feedback for ""ROVER"" would have two ✓ for R? One at position1? And one at position5? But in previous guesses, when we had one R, it showed one? But now? Let's be cautious.

We already have R at position5, so R at position1 would be a duplicate? The secret word could be ""ROVER""?

But from the first guess: ""crane"" had R at position2? And feedback was '-'? Meaning there is an R not at position2? If the secret word is ""ROVER"", it has R at positions 1 and 5? Then in ""crane"", we guessed R at position2? Which is not correct? And R at position2? But secret has R at position1? Then feedback should have one '-' for R? Which it did? And the other R was not guessed? So it didn't show? So possible.

Similarly, E: only one? At position4? In ""ROVER"", E is at position4? So pattern matches.

So ""ROVER"" is a possibility? But R at position1? And in the first guess? We didn't guess position1? So how would we know? It's a possibility.

Similarly, other words.

But ""ROVER"" uses R? Which we haven't placed at position1? We eliminated? R is present? But we are putting it again? So it's a test.

To avoid duplicates? But sometimes Wordle allows duplicates.

Since we have eliminated many letters, the possibilities are:

Common words fitting the pattern:
- POWER (if P and W not eliminated)
- MOVER (M and V)
- LOVER (L and V)
- HOVER (H and V)
- JOKER (J and K)
- MOWER (M and W)
- DOVER (D and V) – Dover is a place name
- ROVER (duplicate R)

We also know from guess1 that R was misplaced at position2? But now in ROVER? R at position1: if we had guessed ""crane"" with R at2? Secret is ROVER: position1 R? And position5 R? So the R in ""crane"" position2? Compared to secret: position2 in secret is O? So no R there? So it is misplaced (should be position1)? So '-' is correct? And the duplicate R at position5? Not guessed? So no problem? So possible.

Similarly, is ""ROVER"" a valid word? Yes.

Now, we have to choose one word to guess.

We can choose a word that uses letters we haven't seen? And avoid rare letters? For example, ROVER uses R again? Which we already know? So it doesn't test new letters? Unless we want to confirm duplicate? But better to test new letters? Then POWER, LOVER, etc.

Given that we don't know L, V, M? Etc.

How about we guess ""MOVER""? Uses M and V? Both new.

Similarly, ""POWER"" uses P and W.

But we have used? Let's see feedback we can get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tries only one new letter? But that might not help? Because we have two positions.

The best is to pick one that we think is likely? But we don't have frequency.

We can choose ""POWER"" because P and W are common letters? Or ""LOVER""?

But note that we have two guesses left? So we can risk one possibility? 

Actually, we should maximize information? But the word might be one of these.

We know the third letter? In the pattern? We need to find it.

Let's look at guess1: we had E as present? But not at position5? But we have it at4? R as present? Not at2? But at5? So we didn't guess position1 and 3? So we can try any.

Option: guess ""JOKER""? J Q K? J rare? So probably not.

But let's be systematic.

We can eliminate by commonality? For example, ""HOVER"", ""MOVER"", ""POWER"", ""LOVER"", ""MOWER"" are common.

We don't know? How about ""LOVER"" as it has LV? Which are common.

But we can also see if there is a word that uses a letter we might have from before? Not really.

With six guesses, we have tries? We have used 3, so we have 3 left? But to be safe, we should try to solve.

We can guess ""POWER"" and see if we get PW.

So, i choose ""LOVER""? Let's don't.

Another constraint? From first guess: We had E misplaced? But in LOVER, E is at4? And that's fixed.

Similarly, all set.

I think ""MOVER"" is a good choice? Because M and V are common? Or perhaps ""POWER""?

But let's look at the available letters? We have P and W, both common.

""POWER"" is more common than ""MOVER""? According to frequency? But I don't know? 

To decide: we can choose ""POWER"" because if it's not that, we can try others?

So, let's guess ""POWER"".

Pattern: P O W E R

So, guess: <guess>power</guess> 

But we must check: P is not eliminated? W is not eliminated? Correct? Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B. So P and W are allowed.

And if feedback? For ""POWER"" guessed on, say, a secret word ""MOVER""? Then feedback:
- P: x? (since M at 1)
- O? ✓
- W: x? since V at 3? 
- E✓, R✓

But W not in the word? Then we know not POWER? Then next guess? But we have three positions? Only one and three? M and so we guess MOVER? Or similar.

Alternatively, if we guess ""LOVER"" and secret is ""MOVER"", then:
- L: x? 
- O✓
- V: but secret has V? At position3? Then ✓? So feedback: L(x), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> so we know the word is ? O V E R? With ? not L? So first letter could be H, M, etc? Then we guess MOVER? Then?

Similarly? I think ""POWER"" or ""LOVER"" are fine.

Let's go with ""POWER"".From the feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in position 4 and **R** in position 5 (word ends with ""ER"").
- **O** is now confirmed in position 2, so the word pattern is **? O ? E R**.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B (absent from the word).
- Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

This leaves the first and third positions to be solved. Common words fitting the pattern include:
- **POWER**: Tests **P** and **W** (both untested common letters).  
- **LOVER**: Tests **L** and **V**.  
- **MOVER**: Tests **M** and **V**.  
- **HOVER**: Tests **H** and **V**.  

Guessing **""POWER""** maximizes information by:
- Testing **P** (position 1) and **W** (position 3), which are high-frequency consonants.  
- Covering the pattern without duplicates (since duplicate R isn't indicated by feedback).  

If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., LOVER/MOVER) efficiently.

But that has two R\'s and we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. Also, we have only one R so far. But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. Actually, the feedback might not account for duplicates properly. So it\'s better to avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another idea: ""RISES"" -> but we have S twice? And we don\'t know if S is in the word. Also, R in position 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we are avoiding E in 5? Actually, E is in 4, which is good. But we have two S\'s. Let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n How about ""ROBES""? \n   R in 1, O in 2, B in 3, E in 4, S in 5 -> E is in 4 (good) and S in 5 (new).

Also, we test T, I, G.\n\n But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. T, I, G are not in the forbidden list.\n\n However, we have to make sure the word is valid.\n\n Let me check: ""TIGER"" is a valid word.\n\n But wait: we are putting R in position 5 and E in position 4. We know from the first guess that E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is a good try. And R is not in position 2, so position 5 is a new position for R.\n\n So ""TIGER"" seems good.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RIPEN"" but that has N which we know is not in the word. So avoid.\n\n Another option: ""ROBES"" as above.\n\n But I think ""TIGER"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, G and places R and E in new positions.\n\n However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n Let\'s go with ""TIGER"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has the letter E in position 4? Then we get a check. Similarly for R in position 5.\n\n We are also testing three new letters: T, I, G.\n\n So, next guess: ""TIGER""\n\n<guess>tiger</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.\n- R is in the word but **not in position 2**.\n- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R and E** (in positions other than 2 and 5, respectively).\n- Must exclude C, A, N.\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, G) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""tiger""** fits these criteria:\n- Places R in position 5 (new position for R).\n- Places E in position 4 (new position for E).\n- Tests new letters T, I, G.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).\n\n<guess>tiger</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C: not in word\n- R: in word but not position 2\n- A: not in word\n- N: not in word\n- E: in word but not position 5\n\nGuess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nMeaning:\n- T: not in word\n- I: not in word\n- G: not in word\n- E: correct and in position 4 (since we placed E in position 4 and got ✓)\n- R: correct and in position 5 (since we placed R in position 5 and got ✓)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has E in the fourth position and R in the fifth position. So the word ends with ""E R"".\n- The third letter of the secret word is not G, and also not N (from first guess), and not I or any other eliminated letters.\n- The first letter is not C, A, T, or G (all eliminated).\n- Available letters: We know E and R are fixed at positions 4 and 5.\n\nWe also know from the first feedback that E is in the word (but not position 5, which we now know is position 4 fixed) and R is in the word (not position 2, and we now know it\'s in position 5).\n\nThe secret word pattern is: _ _ _ E R\n\nWe have eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that fits _ _ _ E R and uses only letters that haven\'t been eliminated. We know that the missing three letters cannot be C, A, N, T, I, G.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we had R in position 2 as a wrong position (but now we know R is in position 5, so that\'s consistent). We also had E in position 5 as wrong (now fixed at 4).\n\nSo we are missing the first three letters.\n\nWe must avoid: C, A, N, T, I, G.\n\nWe also know that R and E are already placed correctly, so the first three letters must not be R or E? Actually, they can be other occurrences? \n\nBut wait: we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. In the feedback, we only got one R and one E marked. For example, in the first guess, we had only one R (at position 2) and one E (at position 5). Now in the second guess, we have E and R at positions 4 and 5 correct.\n\nIf there were duplicates, the feedback might not have shown them? Actually, the feedback would have shown duplicates. For instance, if the secret word had two R\'s, then if we guess one R in the correct position and one R in the wrong position, both would get marked accordingly. But in our case, we only have one R found. Similarly, only one E found.\n\nSo probably, there are no duplicates for R and E, meaning the first three letters are neither R nor E.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word with three distinct letters (not eliminated, and not E or R) for the first three positions.\n\nLet\'s recall common English letters: We have vowels left: O, U. Consonants: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want common letters to maximize information.\n\nLet\'s form a word that ends with ""ER"".\n\nWe have to guess the first three letters.\n\nPossible words: \nFor example: LUMBER -> but we have U? And it\'s 6 letters? No, we need 5 letters: first three.\n\nList some 5-letter words ending with ""ER"":\n\n- Answer: AN?ER but A and N are eliminated, so not.\n- UDDER: but U, D, D -> D is available? And we can try U and D.\n\nBut let\'s think of common words.\n\nActually, we need to use available letters.\n\nWe know the following letters are eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G.\n\nSo available: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that are very rare? But let\'s find a valid word.\n\nWe can consider:\n\n- SOWER: S, O, W, E, R -> so pattern S O W E R -> positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:W\n\nBut we don\'t know if S, O, W are in the word.\n\nSimilarly, another word: ""POWER"" -> P, O, W, E, R.\n\nOr ""LOWER"" -> L, O, W, E, R.\n\nBut we have multiple options. We need to choose one that tests letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nSince we know positions 4 and 5 are fixed, we only need to get the first three.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that includes common letters that haven\'t been tested.\n\nAlready tested letters (in first two guesses): C, R, A, N, E, T, I, G.\n\nSo untested common letters: S, L, O, U, D, M, B, etc.\n\nSo we can try a word that has several of these.\n\nFor example, with S, O, and L: we have ""SOLER""? Is that a word? Soler is not common. No.\n\n""SOBER"": S, O, B, E, R -> but E and R at 4 and 5 fixed? In ""SOBER"", E and R are at positions 4 and 5? Let\'s see:\nS at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> perfect.\n\nAnd S, O, B are letters we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R -> V not tested.\n\nBut ""SOBER"" is a valid word meaning not intoxicated.\n\nAnother option: ""BOXER"", but we have X? Also, O and X.\n\nBut ""SOBER"" seems good.\n\nAlternatively, ""MOWER"": M, O, W, E, R -> M, W not tested.\n\nBut ""SOBER"" tests S, O, B.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we want to get information.\n\nAlso, we must remember that the secret word must have the R and E, which we already have.\n\nNow, are there any constraints from the first guess? \n\nIn the first guess (crane), we had R at position 2 marked as present (but not placed). But now we have R at position 5. Since R is only present once, and now at 5, so that should be fine. The misplaced R at position 2 doesn\'t conflict because we have it at 5.\n\nSimilarly for E: in first guess E was at position 5 and misplaced, but now correctly placed at 4? \n\nWait, no. In the secret word, E is at position 4, so in the first guess we put E at position 5, which is wrong. And now we have it at 4. So all consistent.\n\nTherefore, a valid guess is ""SOBER"".\n\nBut we should consider that the first letter cannot be one of the eliminated? We must not use eliminated letters: so S, O, B are not eliminated (eliminated are C, A, N, T, I, G).\n\nSo ""SOBER"" uses S, O, B, all allowed.\n\nMoreover, if we get feedback, we can see which letters are correct.\n\nAnother word: ""JOKER"" but J and K are less common. Also, J not eliminated? But we might avoid less common.\n\n""SOBER"" seems good.\n\nAnother common word: ""SUPER"" -> S, U, P, E, R -> tests U and P.\n\nBut ""SOBER"" tests O and B as well.\n\nI think ""SOBER"" is fine.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""SOBER"".\n\nBut note: we have to be cautious. The word must have exactly the pattern _ _ _ E R.\n\nSo: <guess>sober</guess>Based on the feedback from ""crane"" and ""tiger"":\n- E and R are confirmed in positions 4 and 5, respectively (word ends with ""ER"").\n- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G (confirmed absent from the secret word).\n- The first three letters must use untested common letters (avoiding E and R duplicates).\n\nThe word **""sober""** fits perfectly:\n- Tests **S**, **O**, and **B** (common letters not previously tried).\n- Maintains E in position 4 and R in position 5.\n- Avoids all eliminated letters.\n\nThis choice will efficiently narrow down possibilities for positions 1–3 while leveraging known correct placements.\n\n<guess>sober</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 3: sober -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C: absent\n- R: present but wrong position (not position 2)\n- A: absent\n- N: absent\n- E: present but wrong position (not position 5)\n\nGuess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nMeaning:\n- T: absent\n- I: absent\n- G: absent\n- E: correct at position 4\n- R: correct at position 5\n\nSo the secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. The word is _ _ _ E R.\n\nAlso, eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G.\n\nGuess 3: sober -> Feedback: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nMeaning:\n- S: absent\n- O: correct at position 2 (since we put O in position 2 and it\'s marked correct)\n- B: absent\n- E: correct at position 4 (already known)\n- R: correct at position 5 (already known)\n\nNow, the secret word pattern is: _ O _ E R\n\nWe have:\n- Position 2: O (now confirmed)\n- Position 4: E\n- Position 5: R\n\nWe need to find the first and third letters.\n\nEliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B (from guesses 1 and 3).\n\nAlso, we know that R and E are placed correctly, so the first and third positions cannot be R or E (unless duplicates, but feedback has not indicated any duplicates so far).\n\nFrom guess 1, R was misplaced at position 2, but now we have O at position 2. Also, R is at position 5, so no duplicate R. Similarly, E is only at position 4.\n\nSo, the first and third positions must be letters that are not eliminated and not E, R, or O (since O is only in position 2).\n\nEliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B.\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, we need to form a 5-letter word with the pattern: _ O _ E R.\n\nThe word must be valid English word.\n\nWe are missing the first and third letters.\n\nSo, we can list possible words:\n\nFor example:\n- HOVER: H O V E R -> V not tested, but H is available? H, O, V? H at pos1, V at pos3? But we have O at 2? \n  Pattern: H O V E R -> positions: 1:H, 3:V.\n\nSimilarly:\n- MOVER: M O V E R -> M at 1, V at 3.\n- LOVER: L O V E R -> L at 1, V at 3.\n- ROVER? But R is already at position 5, and we must avoid duplicate R? But we don\'t know. Also, in this case, if we try R at position 1, but R is in the word? We have R at position 5, so if there\'s another R, it might appear.\n\nBut from feedback, we didn\'t see duplicate R. In the first guess (crane) we had R at position 2 and got a \'-\', which already confirms at least one R. In the second guess (tiger) we had R at position 5 and got ✓. In the third guess (sober) we had R again at position 5 and ✓. But we didn\'t try R in multiple positions at the same guess, so we don\'t know if duplicate exists.\n\nIn guess1, if there were two R\'s, then putting one R in position 2 (if there was one R in position 2) would show one ✓ if correct? But it wasn\'t.\n\nActually, the feedback would show each occurrence. For example, if the word had two R\'s, and we guess one in the wrong position, it would show \'-\', and if we guess one in the correct position, it would show \'✓\'. But we have not guessed R in any position other than 2 and 5. Position 2 had \'-\' meaning that position was wrong and there might be another R? But we now have R at position 5, so the R in position 2 was wrong, but that doesn\'t necessarily imply two R\'s. It could be one R that is at position 5 and was masked as misplaced in position 2.\n\nActually, Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, it might mark both accordingly? But in this case, if there had been two R\'s, in the second guess when we put R only in position 5, it should show only one ✓? And if there was an additional R not guessed, it wouldn\'t show? Actually, no. The feedback marks only for letters present. If a letter appears twice in the secret word, and you guess it once, it will show the feedback only for the one you guessed? But I think it marks every occurrence.\n\nRecall: in Wordle, if the secret word has a duplicate letter, and you guess that letter in one position, it might be marked once if only one instance is present? Actually, the feedback goes by the letter counts. So to be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.\n\nBut for efficiency, we can guess without duplicates for now.\n\nSo, we are looking for words of the form: [first] O [third] E R, with first and third from available letters: D,F,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nNow, common words:\n- HOVER: uses H and V.\n- LOVER: uses L and V.\n- MOVER: uses M and V.\n- POWER: but P and W? Also, available? P yes, W yes? But note: P and W not eliminated. ""POWER"": P O W E R -> positions: P:1, W:3.\n- However, we have not eliminated W? So it\'s possible.\n\nBut wait, let\'s list:\n\nCommon possibilities:\n- HOVER: H and V\n- JOKER: but J and K? And O? Position 2 is O? But JOKER: J O K E R, so J at 1, K at 3? But K? We haven\'t eliminated K? Guess: J and K are available? K not tested? But note, ""tiger"" had G eliminated, but not K? And ""sober"" had B and S eliminated but not K? So K is still available? Wait, is K eliminated? We eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B. So K is available.\n\nSimilarly, U is available? For LOVER? L O V E R -> L and V available? L not eliminated? V not eliminated?\n\nValid words:\n\n- POWER: P O W E R -> P at 1, W at 3\n- BOXER: but B is eliminated? No, in ""sober"" we got B(x) -> absent, so B is eliminated. So we cannot use B.\n\nEliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B.\n\nAvailable: D,F,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWords:\n\n- LOVER: L O V E R -> L at 1, V at 3 -> valid\n- MOVER: M O V E R -> M at 1, V at 3 -> valid\n- HOVER: H O V E R -> H at 1, V at 3 -> valid\n- POWER: P O W E R -> P at 1, W at 3 -> valid\n- MOWER: M O W E R -> M at 1, W at 3 -> valid\n- JOKER: J O K E R -> J at 1, K at 3 -> valid\n- COVER: but C is eliminated? C in cover is first letter? Eliminated, cannot.\n- ROVER: R O V E R -> R at 1? But we already have R at 5? So duplicate R? And R in position 1? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? We can try, but we don\'t get extra information? And if R appears twice, but from previous feedback we saw only one R marked each time? Actually, in ""tiger"", we had R only at position 5 and it was marked ✓, but if there was a duplicate R at position 1, it wouldn\'t be marked because we didn\'t guess it? So we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""ROVER"" has two R\'s? And if we try it, we might get information about duplicate.\n\nBut let\'s avoid for now? We can test one of the letters.\n\nSince we have only two positions open, and we know the word, we can test one and next guess the other.\n\nBut we want to get it in as few guesses as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""FOWLER""? Too long.\n\nOnly 5 letters.\n\nWe have limited choices: first letter can be any available except O,E,R? And third letter any available except O,E,R.\n\nWe can choose words that test common letters? \n\nWe need to guess both positions simultaneously? Because we have two guesses left? Wait, we have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 left? But we want to be efficient.\n\nGiven available letters, try to cover more common letters? For example, we haven\'t tested L, M, P, V, W, etc.\n\nWe can guess a word with L? Or M? Or more?\n\nBut we guess only one letter for each position? \n\nSince there are multiple possibilities, we can try a word that might help differentiate? \n\nBut we need to pick a word that fits the pattern? Let\'s list possible words:\n\nPossible words:\n- HOVER\n- JOKER\n- LOVER\n- MOVER\n- POWER\n- MOWER\n- TOWER? But T is eliminated? T is gone, so no.\n\n- DOVER? D O V E R -> D and V available? D? D not tested? Valid? Place name, I think.\n\nBut let\'s stick to common words.\n\n- POWER, LOVER, MOVER are common.\n\nWe need to choose one? How about ""LOVER""? Uses L and V? Or ""MOVER""? or ""POWER""?\n\nBut we also have to avoid putting eliminated letters.\n\nWe can choose ""POWER"" to test P and W? Or ""LOVER"" to test L and V? Etc.\n\nNow, if we choose ""POWER"" and the feedback shows P correct? Then we know P is at position1? But we are trying to get the first letter?\n\nSimilarly, we can choose a word that includes a vowel? But position1 and 3? Consonants or vowels.\n\nVowels left: U? And sometimes Y.\n\nBut we have U? Like in ""MOURNER""? Not 5 letters.\n\nWe can choose ""LOVER"", which uses L and V? Then if L is absent? Then we eliminate V? Or something?\n\nBut we get feedback per letter? Meaning:\n\nIf we guess ""LOVER"", feedback for:\n- L: either ✓ if first position correct? or \'-\' if misplaced? or x if absent.\n- O: already known and confirmed ✓ (we already know it\'s correct, so feedback for O will be ✓ again? but that\'s redundant).\n- V: for third position?\n- E and R: known ✓.\n\nSo we get new feedback for L and V.\n\nSimilarly for other guesses.\n\nWe can choose any word? But we must have O, E, R in positions 2,4,5.\n\nSo we can pick:\n\nOption 1: ""LOVER"" -> guess: L O V E R\nThen feedback:\n- Position 1: L: will tell if L is in the word? And if at position 1?\n- Position 3: V: similarly.\n\nIf L is ✓ at position1, we solved; if x, then L not present? But if it is misplaced? Then L is in the word but not at position 1? Then we have to use it in another position? But the only unknown positions are 1 and 3? And position 3 would be for V? But if L is misplaced? Then it should be at position 3? Which conflicts with V? Actually, we are putting L at position1 and V at position3. If L should be at position3, then we\'d get L: \'-\' for position1, and V: x or etc.\n\nBut there are words: for example, if the word is ""MOVER"", then ""LOVER"" would have:\n- L: x (since M at position1)\n- V: ? \n\nBut the secret word ""MOVER"": third letter is V? So for ""LOVER"" guessing on MOVER? Then:\n- L at position1: absent? Secret has M at position1? So L:x? \n- V at position3: secret has V? At position3? So ✓? Then feedback: L(x), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓), R(✓)\n\nAnd we know the first letter is wrong? Then next guess we try alternatives: M?\n\nBut we have a small list.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""LOVER"" and the feedback is:\n- L: ✓? Then solved: LOVER is the word? Then all ✓? Or if L: \'-\'? Then L might be at position3? Then the word would have to be something like ? O L E R? For example, ""DOLLER""? Not a common word? Or ""POLER""? But P? Or ""DROLL""? Not pattern? So probably not?\n\nBut let\'s list words that end with O?ER? Actually, the pattern is first letter unknown, second O, third unknown, fourth E, fifth R.\n\nSo words: POWER, MOVER, HOVER, LOVER, JOKER, MOWER, COVER but C eliminated, DOVER, ROVER.\n\nWith ROVER: duplicate R? But possible? R at1 and R at5? Then the feedback for ""ROVER"" would have two ✓ for R? One at position1? And one at position5? But in previous guesses, when we had one R, it showed one? But now? Let\'s be cautious.\n\nWe already have R at position5, so R at position1 would be a duplicate? The secret word could be ""ROVER""?\n\nBut from the first guess: ""crane"" had R at position2? And feedback was \'-\'? Meaning there is an R not at position2? If the secret word is ""ROVER"", it has R at positions 1 and 5? Then in ""crane"", we guessed R at position2? Which is not correct? And R at position2? But secret has R at position1? Then feedback should have one \'-\' for R? Which it did? And the other R was not guessed? So it didn\'t show? So possible.\n\nSimilarly, E: only one? At position4? In ""ROVER"", E is at position4? So pattern matches.\n\nSo ""ROVER"" is a possibility? But R at position1? And in the first guess? We didn\'t guess position1? So how would we know? It\'s a possibility.\n\nSimilarly, other words.\n\nBut ""ROVER"" uses R? Which we haven\'t placed at position1? We eliminated? R is present? But we are putting it again? So it\'s a test.\n\nTo avoid duplicates? But sometimes Wordle allows duplicates.\n\nSince we have eliminated many letters, the possibilities are:\n\nCommon words fitting the pattern:\n- POWER (if P and W not eliminated)\n- MOVER (M and V)\n- LOVER (L and V)\n- HOVER (H and V)\n- JOKER (J and K)\n- MOWER (M and W)\n- DOVER (D and V) – Dover is a place name\n- ROVER (duplicate R)\n\nWe also know from guess1 that R was misplaced at position2? But now in ROVER? R at position1: if we had guessed ""crane"" with R at2? Secret is ROVER: position1 R? And position5 R? So the R in ""crane"" position2? Compared to secret: position2 in secret is O? So no R there? So it is misplaced (should be position1)? So \'-\' is correct? And the duplicate R at position5? Not guessed? So no problem? So possible.\n\nSimilarly, is ""ROVER"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nNow, we have to choose one word to guess.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses letters we haven\'t seen? And avoid rare letters? For example, ROVER uses R again? Which we already know? So it doesn\'t test new letters? Unless we want to confirm duplicate? But better to test new letters? Then POWER, LOVER, etc.\n\nGiven that we don\'t know L, V, M? Etc.\n\nHow about we guess ""MOVER""? Uses M and V? Both new.\n\nSimilarly, ""POWER"" uses P and W.\n\nBut we have used? Let\'s see feedback we can get.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tries only one new letter? But that might not help? Because we have two positions.\n\nThe best is to pick one that we think is likely? But we don\'t have frequency.\n\nWe can choose ""POWER"" because P and W are common letters? Or ""LOVER""?\n\nBut note that we have two guesses left? So we can risk one possibility? \n\nActually, we should maximize information? But the word might be one of these.\n\nWe know the third letter? In the pattern? We need to find it.\n\nLet\'s look at guess1: we had E as present? But not at position5? But we have it at4? R as present? Not at2? But at5? So we didn\'t guess position1 and 3? So we can try any.\n\nOption: guess ""JOKER""? J Q K? J rare? So probably not.\n\nBut let\'s be systematic.\n\nWe can eliminate by commonality? For example, ""HOVER"", ""MOVER"", ""POWER"", ""LOVER"", ""MOWER"" are common.\n\nWe don\'t know? How about ""LOVER"" as it has LV? Which are common.\n\nBut we can also see if there is a word that uses a letter we might have from before? Not really.\n\nWith six guesses, we have tries? We have used 3, so we have 3 left? But to be safe, we should try to solve.\n\nWe can guess ""POWER"" and see if we get PW.\n\nSo, i choose ""LOVER""? Let\'s don\'t.\n\nAnother constraint? From first guess: We had E misplaced? But in LOVER, E is at4? And that\'s fixed.\n\nSimilarly, all set.\n\nI think ""MOVER"" is a good choice? Because M and V are common? Or perhaps ""POWER""?\n\nBut let\'s look at the available letters? We have P and W, both common.\n\n""POWER"" is more common than ""MOVER""? According to frequency? But I don\'t know? \n\nTo decide: we can choose ""POWER"" because if it\'s not that, we can try others?\n\nSo, let\'s guess ""POWER"".\n\nPattern: P O W E R\n\nSo, guess: <guess>power</guess> \n\nBut we must check: P is not eliminated? W is not eliminated? Correct? Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B. So P and W are allowed.\n\nAnd if feedback? For ""POWER"" guessed on, say, a secret word ""MOVER""? Then feedback:\n- P: x? (since M at 1)\n- O? ✓\n- W: x? since V at 3? \n- E✓, R✓\n\nBut W not in the word? Then we know not POWER? Then next guess? But we have three positions? Only one and three? M and so we guess MOVER? Or similar.\n\nAlternatively, if we guess ""LOVER"" and secret is ""MOVER"", then:\n- L: x? \n- O✓\n- V: but secret has V? At position3? Then ✓? So feedback: L(x), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> so we know the word is ? O V E R? With ? not L? So first letter could be H, M, etc? Then we guess MOVER? Then?\n\nSimilarly? I think ""POWER"" or ""LOVER"" are fine.\n\nLet\'s go with ""POWER"".From the feedback:\n- **E** is confirmed in position 4 and **R** in position 5 (word ends with ""ER"").\n- **O** is now confirmed in position 2, so the word pattern is **?

We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning: 
  - C, A, N are absent.
  - R is present but not in position 2.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - T, I, G are absent.
  - E is correct at position 4.
  - R is correct at position 5.

So the secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5: pattern _ _ _ E R.

Guess 3: sober -> Feedback: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - S and B are absent.
  - O is correct at position 2.
  - E and R are correct (positions 4 and 5, already known).

So now the pattern is _ O _ E R.

Guess 4: power -> Feedback: P(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - P is absent.
  - O is correct at position 2 (already known).
  - W is correct at position 3 (since we placed W in position 3 and got ✓).
  - E and R are correct (positions 4 and 5).

So now we know:
  - The secret word has W in position 3.
  - The pattern is _ O W E R.

We only need to find the first letter.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B, P (from all feedback).

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But the first letter must be one that forms a valid English word with ""OWER"" (since positions 2,3,4,5 are O,W,E,R).

We know the word ends with ""OWER"", so the first letter must be a letter that makes a 5-letter word.

Common words: 
  - POWER (but P is eliminated, and we just guessed it and P is absent, so not POWER)
  - TOWER (T is eliminated)
  - LOWER: L is available? L not eliminated? Yes, so LOWER is a possibility.
  - MOWER: M available? Yes.
  - COVER: C eliminated.
  - HOVER: H available? Yes.
  - JOKER: J and K? But the pattern is O W E R? JOKER is J O K E R, but we have W at position 3? So not? Because we have W at position 3? So the word must be ? O W E R.

So the third letter is W, so the word is ? O W E R.

What words have the pattern ?OWER? 

- LOWER: L O W E R
- MOWER: M O W E R
- SOWER: S is eliminated? S was absent in guess3.
- TOWER: T eliminated.
- BOWER: B eliminated.
- POWER: P eliminated.
- COVER: C eliminated and also pattern is C O V E R, not O W E R? So no.

So the only common words are LOWER and MOWER? 

But are there others? 
- DOWER: D O W E R? D is available? D not eliminated? And DOWER is a word (meaning a widow's share of property or to endow).
- HOWER? Not a word.
- JOWER? Not a word.
- KOWER? Not a word.
- VOWER? Not a word.
- ROWER: R O W E R? But R is at position 5? So duplicate R? And R at position 1? But we have R at position 5? So ROWER? Is that a word? Yes, meaning one who rows a boat.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But from feedback, we haven't seen duplicate R? But it's possible.

Similarly, FOWER? Not a word? Or YOWER? Not common.

So possible words: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.

But we have eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B,P.

So available: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

So L, M, D, R (but R is already present? So ROWER would have two R's) are possible.

But we must choose one? We have two guesses left? We can try one.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2? And it was misplaced? If the secret word is ROWER, then R at position 1? And position 5? So in the first guess, we put R at position 2? Which is not correct? So it was marked as present but wrong position? And the R at position 1 was not guessed? So it didn't show? So possible? But we also have to consider that in the secret word, position 2 is O? So in ""crane"", position 2 was R? But secret has O? So R at position 2 is wrong? So the '-' is correct? So ROWER is a possibility.

Similarly, for LOWER, MOWER, DOWER.

Now, we need to guess one? How to choose? We can try LOWER? Because L is a common letter? Or MOWER? M is common.

But we can also consider that we have not tested L, M, D? So we can try one.

But if we guess LOWER and it's wrong? Then we know it's one of the others? But we have two guesses left? So we can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't used? But we only have one letter to guess? The first letter? So we have to pick one.

We can try ""LOWER"" first? Then if not, ""MOWER"" next? Or ""DOWER""? 

But let's see if there is a word that can test multiple? But we can't? Because the pattern is fixed: ?OWER.

So we must guess one of the possibilities.

I think ""LOWER"" is a common word? So let's try that.

But we must check: L is not eliminated? Correct? So:

Guess: LOWER

But LOWER: L O W E R -> positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R.

If the secret word is LOWER, we get all ✓? If not, then we get feedback on L? If L is absent? Or misplaced? But if absent, then we know L is not the first letter? And not in the word? Then we can try MOWER? Or DOWER? Or ROWER.

But if L is absent? Then the word must be MOWER or DOWER or ROWER? But we have to see the feedback.

But in the feedback for LOWER, if L is absent, then we get:
- L: x
- O: ✓
- W: ✓
- E: ✓
- R: ✓

Then we know the first letter is not L? And L is absent? So the word must be MOWER, DOWER, or ROWER? Then we can try MOWER next? If MOWER is wrong? Then DOWER or ROWER? But we have one guess left? So we might not get it? But we have two guesses after this? We have used 4, so 2 left? So we can try two? But if we have three possibilities? We might not get it in two? But we have two guesses? So if we guess LOWER and it's wrong? Then we have two possibilities? Then we can try one? And if wrong? Then the last one? But we have only one guess left? So we can only try one? Then if wrong? We lose? But we have two guesses left? After guess4, we have two guesses? So we can make two more? So we can try two of the three? But we have three possibilities? So we might not get it? But let's list:

Possibilities: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? Four? Oh, I forgot ROWER.

So four possibilities? But we have two guesses? So we might not cover all? But we can try to choose a word that is not one of them? But we have to fit the pattern? We cannot? Because the pattern is fixed? We have to guess a word that has O W E R in positions 2,3,4,5? So the only freedom is the first letter? And we have to choose from the available letters that form words.

But we don't know which letters form words? We have to rely on common words.

Common words: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? And maybe others? But I think that's it.

But we can try to guess a word that has a different first letter? But that is not a valid word? Then it would be invalid? So we must guess one of the valid words.

So we have to choose one? And hope? Or choose one that covers more information? But we can't? Because the only information is the first letter.

So let's try the most common one? LOWER? Or MOWER?

According to word frequency? LOWER is more common? Or MOWER? I think both are common.

But we can consider the first guess? We had R at position2? And it was misplaced? If the word is ROWER, then R at position1? So we might have a duplicate? But we don't know? So perhaps avoid ROWER for now? Because duplicates are less common? So try LOWER or MOWER first.

But we have to choose? Let's try LOWER.

So guess: <guess>lower</guess>

But if it's wrong? Then we have MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? Then we can try MOWER? If wrong? Then we have DOWER and ROWER? But we have only one guess left? So we have to choose between DOWER and ROWER? And we might be wrong? But DOWER is less common? So we might choose ROWER? But it's risky.

Alternatively, we can try a word that is not of the pattern? But we know the pattern? So we must use the pattern? Because we know O,W,E,R are fixed? So we have to guess the first letter? So we cannot avoid.

But we can try to guess a word that has the same letters? But no? Because the positions are fixed.

So we have to guess one of the possibilities.

But note: in the feedback for ""power"", we got W(✓) at position3? So W is fixed? So we cannot change.

So I think we must guess one of LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.

But to be safe? We can try a word that uses a letter that is not in the possibilities? But that would be invalid? Because the first letter must be one that forms a word.

So let's list the possible first letters: L, M, D, R.

We have not tested L, M, D? R is known to be in the word? But at position5? So if we use R at position1? It might be duplicate.

But we can try ""ROWER"" as a guess? Because if it's correct? We win? If not? Then we get feedback? If R is absent? Then we know no duplicate? Then the word must be LOWER, MOWER, or DOWER? But then we have three possibilities and one guess? We cannot cover? So we lose? So it's risky.

If we guess ""ROWER"" and it's not the word? Then feedback:
- R: if the word has no duplicate? Then R at position1 is absent? So x? Then we know R is only at position5? Then the word is LOWER, MOWER, or DOWER? But we have one guess left? We have to choose one? And we might be wrong.

So better to guess a word that is not ROWER? So that if it's wrong? We eliminate one letter? Then we have two guesses for the remaining? But we have only one guess left after that? So we can cover two? But there are three? So we might not.

But let's count the possibilities: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? Four? But we have two guesses? So we can cover two? But if we guess one? And it's wrong? Then we have three left? And one guess? We can only cover one? So we lose? Unless we guess correctly.

But we don't know which one? So we need a different strategy? But we cannot? Because the pattern is fixed.

Perhaps there is another word? For example, ""VOWER""? Not a word? Or ""HOWE R""? Not.

Or ""FOW E R""? Not.

I think the only common words are LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.

But DOWER is less common? So perhaps we can ignore it? Or not.

Another word: ""SOWER"" but S is eliminated? So not.

""TOWER"" T eliminated.

""BOWER"" B eliminated.

So only LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.

But DOWER is a valid word? Yes.

Now, to maximize our chances? We can guess the most common one? According to word frequency? 

In English, ""lower"" is more common than ""mower"", ""dower"", ""rower"".

For example, ""lower"" is an adjective, verb? Common.

""Mower"" is a noun, less common.

""Dower"" is legal term, less common.

""Rower"" is a person, less common.

So we should guess ""LOWER"" first.

If it's not, then we guess ""MOWER"" next? Then if not, we have DOWER and ROWER? But we have only two guesses? After LOWER, if wrong, we have one guess? Then we can guess ""MOWER""? If wrong, we lose? But we have two possibilities left? DOWER and ROWER? So we cannot cover? So we might lose.

But we have to hope that it's LOWER or MOWER? Or we can guess a word that is not of the pattern? But we cannot? Because we know the pattern.

Unless we guess a word that has the same letters but different positions? But we know the positions of O,W,E,R? So we cannot change? Because they are fixed.

For example, if we guess ""MOWER"" and it's not the word? Then we get feedback? If M is absent? Then we know M is not first? And not in the word? Then we can try LOWER? Or if M is present but not at position1? But position1 is the only unknown? So if M is absent? Then we know M is not the first letter? And not in the word? Then we can try LOWER? But LOWER might be the word? Or DOWER? Or ROWER.

But if we guess ""MOWER"" and get:
- M: x? Then M is absent? So the word is not MOWER? And M not in word? Then we try LOWER? If LOWER is not? Then we have DOWER and ROWER? But one guess left? We can only try one? So we might lose.

Similarly, if we guess ""LOWER"" and get L: x? Then L absent? Then we try MOWER? If MOWER is not? Then we have DOWER and ROWER? Same problem.

So to avoid this? We can try to guess a word that has a letter that is in multiple possibilities? But the first letter is different for each? So we cannot.

Another idea: guess a word that is not in the possibilities? But that has the pattern? But we have to guess a valid word? And we listed the valid ones.

Perhaps ""COWER""? But C eliminated? And pattern is C O W E R? But we have W at position3? So it fits? But C is eliminated? So not.

Or ""HOWE R""? Not 5 letters? ""HOWER"" not a word.

So I think we have to guess one? And hope.

But let's see the feedback from guess1: we had E and R present? But we have them fixed? And O and W are new? But we have them fixed.

Perhaps we can consider that in the first guess, we had no information about position1 and 3? But now we have position3 fixed as W.

So I think we must guess.

Let's guess ""LOWER"" as it is the most common.

So <guess>lower</guess>

### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C, A, N are **absent** from the word.  
  - R is **present** but not in position 2.  
  - E is **present** but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: tiger**  
  Feedback: T(x), I(x), G(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - T, I, G are **absent**.  
  - E is **correct** at position 4.  
  - R is **correct** at position 5.  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ E R`.  

- **Guess 3: sober**  
  Feedback: S(x), O(✓), B(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S and B are **absent**.  
  - O is **correct** at position 2.  
  - E and R are **correct** (positions 4 and 5).  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ O _ E R`.  

- **Guess 4: power**  
  Feedback: P(x), O(✓), W(✓), E(✓), R(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - P is **absent**.  
  - O is **correct** at position 2 (already known).  
  - W is **correct** at position 3.  
  - E and R are **correct** (positions 4 and 5).  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ O W E R`.  

### Current Knowledge
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 2: **O**  
  - Position 3: **W**  
  - Position 4: **E**  
  - Position 5: **R**  
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B, P (all marked ""x"" in previous feedback).  
- **Available letters for position 1**: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (not eliminated and not already placed).  
- **Secret word pattern**: `? O W E R`.  
- **Possible words**: Only valid English words fitting `?OWER` with the first letter from the available set. Common options:  
  - `LOWER` (L is available and common).  
  - `MOWER` (M is available).  
  - `DOWER` (D is available, but less common).  
  - `ROWER` (R is available, but duplicate R; possible but less likely based on feedback).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- We need to guess the first letter. With only one unknown position, we must test one of the possible words.  
- **Why not guess a non-pattern word?**  
  The pattern `?OWER` is fixed (positions 2–5 confirmed), so any guess must match this to be valid. Guessing a non-pattern word would waste a turn and not provide useful information for position 1.  
- **Prioritization**:  
  - `LOWER` is the most common word fitting the pattern (e.g., ""lower"" as an adjective/verb).  
  - If `LOWER` is incorrect, feedback will confirm if L is absent or misplaced, narrowing to `MOWER`, `DOWER`, or `ROWER` for the final guess.  
- **Risk assessment**:  
  - We have 2 guesses left (after this one). If `LOWER` is wrong, feedback will eliminate L, and we can guess `MOWER` next (as the next most common option).  
  - If both `LOWER` and `MOWER` fail, `DOWER` or `ROWER` would be the last resort, but this is unlikely given their lower frequency.  

### Next Guess: `LOWER`
- Tests L in position 1.  
- If correct, we solve the puzzle.  
- If incorrect, feedback on L (absent or misplaced) will directly identify the first letter from the remaining options.  

<guess>lower</guess>",lower,"We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning: 
  - C, A, N are absent.
  - R is present but not in position 2.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - T, I, G are absent.
  - E is correct at position 4.
  - R is correct at position 5.

So the secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5: pattern _ _ _ E R.

Guess 3: sober -> Feedback: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - S and B are absent.
  - O is correct at position 2.
  - E and R are correct (positions 4 and 5, already known).

So now the pattern is _ O _ E R.

Guess 4: power -> Feedback: P(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - P is absent.
  - O is correct at position 2 (already known).
  - W is correct at position 3 (since we placed W in position 3 and got ✓).
  - E and R are correct (positions 4 and 5).

So now we know:
  - The secret word has W in position 3.
  - The pattern is _ O W E R.

We only need to find the first letter.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B, P (from all feedback).

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But the first letter must be one that forms a valid English word with ""OWER"" (since positions 2,3,4,5 are O,W,E,R).

We know the word ends with ""OWER"", so the first letter must be a letter that makes a 5-letter word.

Common words: 
  - POWER (but P is eliminated, and we just guessed it and P is absent, so not POWER)
  - TOWER (T is eliminated)
  - LOWER: L is available? L not eliminated? Yes, so LOWER is a possibility.
  - MOWER: M available? Yes.
  - COVER: C eliminated.
  - HOVER: H available? Yes.
  - JOKER: J and K? But the pattern is O W E R? JOKER is J O K E R, but we have W at position 3? So not? Because we have W at position 3? So the word must be ? O W E R.

So the third letter is W, so the word is ? O W E R.

What words have the pattern ?OWER? 

- LOWER: L O W E R
- MOWER: M O W E R
- SOWER: S is eliminated? S was absent in guess3.
- TOWER: T eliminated.
- BOWER: B eliminated.
- POWER: P eliminated.
- COVER: C eliminated and also pattern is C O V E R, not O W E R? So no.

So the only common words are LOWER and MOWER? 

But are there others? 
- DOWER: D O W E R? D is available? D not eliminated? And DOWER is a word (meaning a widow's share of property or to endow).
- HOWER? Not a word.
- JOWER? Not a word.
- KOWER? Not a word.
- VOWER? Not a word.
- ROWER: R O W E R? But R is at position 5? So duplicate R? And R at position 1? But we have R at position 5? So ROWER? Is that a word? Yes, meaning one who rows a boat.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But from feedback, we haven't seen duplicate R? But it's possible.

Similarly, FOWER? Not a word? Or YOWER? Not common.

So possible words: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.

But we have eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B,P.

So available: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

So L, M, D, R (but R is already present? So ROWER would have two R's) are possible.

But we must choose one? We have two guesses left? We can try one.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2? And it was misplaced? If the secret word is ROWER, then R at position 1? And position 5? So in the first guess, we put R at position 2? Which is not correct? So it was marked as present but wrong position? And the R at position 1 was not guessed? So it didn't show? So possible? But we also have to consider that in the secret word, position 2 is O? So in ""crane"", position 2 was R? But secret has O? So R at position 2 is wrong? So the '-' is correct? So ROWER is a possibility.

Similarly, for LOWER, MOWER, DOWER.

Now, we need to guess one? How to choose? We can try LOWER? Because L is a common letter? Or MOWER? M is common.

But we can also consider that we have not tested L, M, D? So we can try one.

But if we guess LOWER and it's wrong? Then we know it's one of the others? But we have two guesses left? So we can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't used? But we only have one letter to guess? The first letter? So we have to pick one.

We can try ""LOWER"" first? Then if not, ""MOWER"" next? Or ""DOWER""? 

But let's see if there is a word that can test multiple? But we can't? Because the pattern is fixed: ?OWER.

So we must guess one of the possibilities.

I think ""LOWER"" is a common word? So let's try that.

But we must check: L is not eliminated? Correct? So:

Guess: LOWER

But LOWER: L O W E R -> positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R.

If the secret word is LOWER, we get all ✓? If not, then we get feedback on L? If L is absent? Or misplaced? But if absent, then we know L is not the first letter? And not in the word? Then we can try MOWER? Or DOWER? Or ROWER.

But if L is absent? Then the word must be MOWER or DOWER or ROWER? But we have to see the feedback.

But in the feedback for LOWER, if L is absent, then we get:
- L: x
- O: ✓
- W: ✓
- E: ✓
- R: ✓

Then we know the first letter is not L? And L is absent? So the word must be MOWER, DOWER, or ROWER? Then we can try MOWER next? If MOWER is wrong? Then DOWER or ROWER? But we have one guess left? So we might not get it? But we have two guesses after this? We have used 4, so 2 left? So we can try two? But if we have three possibilities? We might not get it in two? But we have two guesses? So if we guess LOWER and it's wrong? Then we have two possibilities? Then we can try one? And if wrong? Then the last one? But we have only one guess left? So we can only try one? Then if wrong? We lose? But we have two guesses left? After guess4, we have two guesses? So we can make two more? So we can try two of the three? But we have three possibilities? So we might not get it? But let's list:

Possibilities: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? Four? Oh, I forgot ROWER.

So four possibilities? But we have two guesses? So we might not cover all? But we can try to choose a word that is not one of them? But we have to fit the pattern? We cannot? Because the pattern is fixed? We have to guess a word that has O W E R in positions 2,3,4,5? So the only freedom is the first letter? And we have to choose from the available letters that form words.

But we don't know which letters form words? We have to rely on common words.

Common words: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? And maybe others? But I think that's it.

But we can try to guess a word that has a different first letter? But that is not a valid word? Then it would be invalid? So we must guess one of the valid words.

So we have to choose one? And hope? Or choose one that covers more information? But we can't? Because the only information is the first letter.

So let's try the most common one? LOWER? Or MOWER?

According to word frequency? LOWER is more common? Or MOWER? I think both are common.

But we can consider the first guess? We had R at position2? And it was misplaced? If the word is ROWER, then R at position1? So we might have a duplicate? But we don't know? So perhaps avoid ROWER for now? Because duplicates are less common? So try LOWER or MOWER first.

But we have to choose? Let's try LOWER.

So guess: <guess>lower</guess>

But if it's wrong? Then we have MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? Then we can try MOWER? If wrong? Then we have DOWER and ROWER? But we have only one guess left? So we have to choose between DOWER and ROWER? And we might be wrong? But DOWER is less common? So we might choose ROWER? But it's risky.

Alternatively, we can try a word that is not of the pattern? But we know the pattern? So we must use the pattern? Because we know O,W,E,R are fixed? So we have to guess the first letter? So we cannot avoid.

But we can try to guess a word that has the same letters? But no? Because the positions are fixed.

So we have to guess one of the possibilities.

But note: in the feedback for ""power"", we got W(✓) at position3? So W is fixed? So we cannot change.

So I think we must guess one of LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.

But to be safe? We can try a word that uses a letter that is not in the possibilities? But that would be invalid? Because the first letter must be one that forms a word.

So let's list the possible first letters: L, M, D, R.

We have not tested L, M, D? R is known to be in the word? But at position5? So if we use R at position1? It might be duplicate.

But we can try ""ROWER"" as a guess? Because if it's correct? We win? If not? Then we get feedback? If R is absent? Then we know no duplicate? Then the word must be LOWER, MOWER, or DOWER? But then we have three possibilities and one guess? We cannot cover? So we lose? So it's risky.

If we guess ""ROWER"" and it's not the word? Then feedback:
- R: if the word has no duplicate? Then R at position1 is absent? So x? Then we know R is only at position5? Then the word is LOWER, MOWER, or DOWER? But we have one guess left? We have to choose one? And we might be wrong.

So better to guess a word that is not ROWER? So that if it's wrong? We eliminate one letter? Then we have two guesses for the remaining? But we have only one guess left after that? So we can cover two? But there are three? So we might not.

But let's count the possibilities: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? Four? But we have two guesses? So we can cover two? But if we guess one? And it's wrong? Then we have three left? And one guess? We can only cover one? So we lose? Unless we guess correctly.

But we don't know which one? So we need a different strategy? But we cannot? Because the pattern is fixed.

Perhaps there is another word? For example, ""VOWER""? Not a word? Or ""HOWE R""? Not.

Or ""FOW E R""? Not.

I think the only common words are LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.

But DOWER is less common? So perhaps we can ignore it? Or not.

Another word: ""SOWER"" but S is eliminated? So not.

""TOWER"" T eliminated.

""BOWER"" B eliminated.

So only LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.

But DOWER is a valid word? Yes.

Now, to maximize our chances? We can guess the most common one? According to word frequency? 

In English, ""lower"" is more common than ""mower"", ""dower"", ""rower"".

For example, ""lower"" is an adjective, verb? Common.

""Mower"" is a noun, less common.

""Dower"" is legal term, less common.

""Rower"" is a person, less common.

So we should guess ""LOWER"" first.

If it's not, then we guess ""MOWER"" next? Then if not, we have DOWER and ROWER? But we have only two guesses? After LOWER, if wrong, we have one guess? Then we can guess ""MOWER""? If wrong, we lose? But we have two possibilities left? DOWER and ROWER? So we cannot cover? So we might lose.

But we have to hope that it's LOWER or MOWER? Or we can guess a word that is not of the pattern? But we cannot? Because we know the pattern.

Unless we guess a word that has the same letters but different positions? But we know the positions of O,W,E,R? So we cannot change? Because they are fixed.

For example, if we guess ""MOWER"" and it's not the word? Then we get feedback? If M is absent? Then we know M is not first? And not in the word? Then we can try LOWER? Or if M is present but not at position1? But position1 is the only unknown? So if M is absent? Then we know M is not the first letter? And not in the word? Then we can try LOWER? But LOWER might be the word? Or DOWER? Or ROWER.

But if we guess ""MOWER"" and get:
- M: x? Then M is absent? So the word is not MOWER? And M not in word? Then we try LOWER? If LOWER is not? Then we have DOWER and ROWER? But one guess left? We can only try one? So we might lose.

Similarly, if we guess ""LOWER"" and get L: x? Then L absent? Then we try MOWER? If MOWER is not? Then we have DOWER and ROWER? Same problem.

So to avoid this? We can try to guess a word that has a letter that is in multiple possibilities? But the first letter is different for each? So we cannot.

Another idea: guess a word that is not in the possibilities? But that has the pattern? But we have to guess a valid word? And we listed the valid ones.

Perhaps ""COWER""? But C eliminated? And pattern is C O W E R? But we have W at position3? So it fits? But C is eliminated? So not.

Or ""HOWE R""? Not 5 letters? ""HOWER"" not a word.

So I think we have to guess one? And hope.

But let's see the feedback from guess1: we had E and R present? But we have them fixed? And O and W are new? But we have them fixed.

Perhaps we can consider that in the first guess, we had no information about position1 and 3? But now we have position3 fixed as W.

So I think we must guess.

Let's guess ""LOWER"" as it is the most common.

- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C, A, N are **absent** from the word.  
  - R is **present** but not in position 2.  
  - E is **present** but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: tiger**  
  Feedback: T(x), I(x), G(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - T, I, G are **absent**.  
  - E is **correct** at position 4.  
  - R is **correct** at position 5.  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ E R`.  

- **Guess 3: sober**  
  Feedback: S(x), O(✓), B(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S and B are **absent**.  
  - O is **correct** at position 2.  
  - E and R are **correct** (positions 4 and 5).  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ O _ E R`.  

- **Guess 4: power**  
  Feedback: P(x), O(✓), W(✓), E(✓), R(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - P is **absent**.  
  - O is **correct** at position 2 (already known).  
  - W is **correct** at position 3.  
  - E and R are **correct** (positions 4 and 5).  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ O W E R`.  

### Current Knowledge
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 2: **O**  
  - Position 3: **W**  
  - Position 4: **E**  
  - Position 5: **R**  
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B, P (all marked ""x"" in previous feedback).  
- **Available letters for position 1**: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (not eliminated and not already placed).  
- **Secret word pattern**: `? O W E R`.  
- **Possible words**: Only valid English words fitting `?OWER` with the first letter from the available set. Common options:  
  - `LOWER` (L is available and common).  
  - `MOWER` (M is available).  
  - `DOWER` (D is available, but less common).  
  - `ROWER` (R is available, but duplicate R; possible but less likely based on feedback).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- We need to guess the first letter. With only one unknown position, we must test one of the possible words.  
- **Why not guess a non-pattern word?**  
  The pattern `?OWER` is fixed (positions 2–5 confirmed), so any guess must match this to be valid. Guessing a non-pattern word would waste a turn and not provide useful information for position 1.  
- **Prioritization**:  
  - `LOWER` is the most common word fitting the pattern (e.g., ""lower"" as an adjective/verb).  
  - If `LOWER` is incorrect, feedback will confirm if L is absent or misplaced, narrowing to `MOWER`, `DOWER`, or `ROWER` for the final guess.  
- **Risk assessment**:  
  - We have 2 guesses left (after this one). If `LOWER` is wrong, feedback will eliminate L, and we can guess `MOWER` next (as the next most common option).  
  - If both `LOWER` and `MOWER` fail, `DOWER` or `ROWER` would be the last resort, but this is unlikely given their lower frequency.  

### Next Guess: `LOWER`
- Tests L in position 1.  
- If correct, we solve the puzzle.  
- If incorrect, feedback on L (absent or misplaced) will directly identify the first letter from the remaining options.",Guess 5: lower -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: - (in the word but wrong position)
 A: x (not in the word)
 N: x (not in the word)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C, A, N are not in the secret word.
 - The letter R is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it in the second position and got a '-' meaning it's present but misplaced).
 - The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

 Also, since we have three incorrect letters (C, A, N) and two correct letters (R and E) but in the wrong positions, we can use this to form our next guess.

 Important: The secret word must contain R and E, but not C, A, N.

 Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that:
 1. Does not contain C, A, N.
 2. Contains R and E (but not in the positions we already tried for them? Actually, we know R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5, but they could be in other positions).

 We also want to try to place R and E in new positions and include other common letters to get more information.

 Let's think about the positions:
 - R was in position 2 in ""crane"" -> so in the secret word, R is not in position 2. Therefore, R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.
 - E was in position 5 in ""crane"" -> so in the secret word, E is not in position 5. Therefore, E must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

 We can also consider that the word has 5 letters and we have two of them (R and E) but we don't know the other three.

 Since we have eliminated C, A, N, we can avoid those.

 Let's think of a word that includes R and E, and uses other common letters (like S, T, L, O, etc.) and that doesn't have C, A, N.

 We also want to try to place R and E in positions we haven't tried for them. For example, we can try R in position 1, 3, or 4 and E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not the same as R).

 Some words that come to mind:

 Option 1: ""ROLES"" -> 
   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R, since previously we had it in position 2 and now we try position 1)
   O is a new letter
   L is new
   E in position 4 (previously we had E in position 5, so position 4 is new for E)
   S is new

 But note: we don't know if O, L, S are in the word or not.

 Option 2: ""STORE"" -> 
   S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, R in 4, E in 5 -> but wait, we know E is not in position 5 (from previous feedback). So we cannot put E in position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it's not there so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting E in position 5.

 So let's avoid putting E in position 5 and R in position 2.

 Another option: ""TRIED"" -> 
   T in 1, R in 2 -> but we know R is not in position 2? Actually, we had R in position 2 and got a '-' meaning it's present but not in that position. So we should avoid putting R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it's not there. So better to put R in a new position.

 Therefore, let's avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E.

 I think ""ROLES"" is a good candidate because:
   R is in position 1 (new for R)
   E is in position 4 (new for E, previously we had it in 5)
   We are testing O, L, S.

 Alternatively, we could try ""RICES"" but that has C and we know C is not in the word. So we must avoid C, A, N.

 Another word: ""ROUTE"" -> 
   R in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, E in 5 -> but E is in position 5 which we know is wrong. So avoid.

 How about ""RIPER""? But that has two R's and we don't know if the word has two R's. Also, we have only one R so far. But the feedback doesn't tell us about duplicates. Actually, the feedback might not account for duplicates properly. So it's better to avoid duplicates for now.

 Another idea: ""RISES"" -> but we have S twice? And we don't know if S is in the word. Also, R in position 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we are avoiding E in 5? Actually, E is in 4, which is good. But we have two S's. Let's avoid duplicates for now.

 How about ""ROBES""? 
   R in 1, O in 2, B in 3, E in 4, S in 5 -> E is in 4 (good) and S in 5 (new). But we are testing O and B.

 But note: we don't know if the word has O or B.

 Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position and R in a different position, and also test other common letters.

 Another common word: ""TIGER"" -> 
   T in 1, I in 2, G in 3, E in 4, R in 5 -> 
   Here, R is in position 5 (which is new for R) and E is in position 4 (new for E). Also, we test T, I, G.

 But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. T, I, G are not in the forbidden list.

 However, we have to make sure the word is valid.

 Let me check: ""TIGER"" is a valid word.

 But wait: we are putting R in position 5 and E in position 4. We know from the first guess that E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is a good try. And R is not in position 2, so position 5 is a new position for R.

 So ""TIGER"" seems good.

 Alternatively, we can try ""RIPEN"" but that has N which we know is not in the word. So avoid.

 Another option: ""ROBES"" as above.

 But I think ""TIGER"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, G and places R and E in new positions.

 However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.

 Let's go with ""TIGER"".

 But wait: what if the secret word has the letter E in position 4? Then we get a check. Similarly for R in position 5.

 We are also testing three new letters: T, I, G.

 So, next guess: ""TIGER""

<guess>tiger</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.
- R is in the word but **not in position 2**.
- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.

For the next guess:
- Must include **R and E** (in positions other than 2 and 5, respectively).
- Must exclude C, A, N.
- Should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, G) to gather more information.

The word **""tiger""** fits these criteria:
- Places R in position 5 (new position for R).
- Places E in position 4 (new position for E).
- Tests new letters T, I, G.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).

<guess>tiger</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C: not in word
- R: in word but not position 2
- A: not in word
- N: not in word
- E: in word but not position 5

Guess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
- T: not in word
- I: not in word
- G: not in word
- E: correct and in position 4 (since we placed E in position 4 and got ✓)
- R: correct and in position 5 (since we placed R in position 5 and got ✓)

So now we know:
- The secret word has E in the fourth position and R in the fifth position. So the word ends with ""E R"".
- The third letter of the secret word is not G, and also not N (from first guess), and not I or any other eliminated letters.
- The first letter is not C, A, T, or G (all eliminated).
- Available letters: We know E and R are fixed at positions 4 and 5.

We also know from the first feedback that E is in the word (but not position 5, which we now know is position 4 fixed) and R is in the word (not position 2, and we now know it's in position 5).

The secret word pattern is: _ _ _ E R

We have eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G

Now, we need to guess a word that fits _ _ _ E R and uses only letters that haven't been eliminated. We know that the missing three letters cannot be C, A, N, T, I, G.

Also, from the first guess, we had R in position 2 as a wrong position (but now we know R is in position 5, so that's consistent). We also had E in position 5 as wrong (now fixed at 4).

So we are missing the first three letters.

We must avoid: C, A, N, T, I, G.

We also know that R and E are already placed correctly, so the first three letters must not be R or E? Actually, they can be other occurrences? 

But wait: we don't know if there are duplicate letters. In the feedback, we only got one R and one E marked. For example, in the first guess, we had only one R (at position 2) and one E (at position 5). Now in the second guess, we have E and R at positions 4 and 5 correct.

If there were duplicates, the feedback might not have shown them? Actually, the feedback would have shown duplicates. For instance, if the secret word had two R's, then if we guess one R in the correct position and one R in the wrong position, both would get marked accordingly. But in our case, we only have one R found. Similarly, only one E found.

So probably, there are no duplicates for R and E, meaning the first three letters are neither R nor E.

Therefore, we must choose a word with three distinct letters (not eliminated, and not E or R) for the first three positions.

Let's recall common English letters: We have vowels left: O, U. Consonants: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But we want common letters to maximize information.

Let's form a word that ends with ""ER"".

We have to guess the first three letters.

Possible words: 
For example: LUMBER -> but we have U? And it's 6 letters? No, we need 5 letters: first three.

List some 5-letter words ending with ""ER"":

- Answer: AN?ER but A and N are eliminated, so not.
- UDDER: but U, D, D -> D is available? And we can try U and D.

But let's think of common words.

Actually, we need to use available letters.

We know the following letters are eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G.

So available: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We should avoid using letters that are very rare? But let's find a valid word.

We can consider:

- SOWER: S, O, W, E, R -> so pattern S O W E R -> positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:W

But we don't know if S, O, W are in the word.

Similarly, another word: ""POWER"" -> P, O, W, E, R.

Or ""LOWER"" -> L, O, W, E, R.

But we have multiple options. We need to choose one that tests letters we haven't tried.

Since we know positions 4 and 5 are fixed, we only need to get the first three.

To maximize information, we should choose a word that includes common letters that haven't been tested.

Already tested letters (in first two guesses): C, R, A, N, E, T, I, G.

So untested common letters: S, L, O, U, D, M, B, etc.

So we can try a word that has several of these.

For example, with S, O, and L: we have ""SOLER""? Is that a word? Soler is not common. No.

""SOBER"": S, O, B, E, R -> but E and R at 4 and 5 fixed? In ""SOBER"", E and R are at positions 4 and 5? Let's see:
S at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> perfect.

And S, O, B are letters we haven't tested yet.

Similarly, other words: ""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R -> V not tested.

But ""SOBER"" is a valid word meaning not intoxicated.

Another option: ""BOXER"", but we have X? Also, O and X.

But ""SOBER"" seems good.

Alternatively, ""MOWER"": M, O, W, E, R -> M, W not tested.

But ""SOBER"" tests S, O, B.

Since we have limited guesses, we want to get information.

Also, we must remember that the secret word must have the R and E, which we already have.

Now, are there any constraints from the first guess? 

In the first guess (crane), we had R at position 2 marked as present (but not placed). But now we have R at position 5. Since R is only present once, and now at 5, so that should be fine. The misplaced R at position 2 doesn't conflict because we have it at 5.

Similarly for E: in first guess E was at position 5 and misplaced, but now correctly placed at 4? 

Wait, no. In the secret word, E is at position 4, so in the first guess we put E at position 5, which is wrong. And now we have it at 4. So all consistent.

Therefore, a valid guess is ""SOBER"".

But we should consider that the first letter cannot be one of the eliminated? We must not use eliminated letters: so S, O, B are not eliminated (eliminated are C, A, N, T, I, G).

So ""SOBER"" uses S, O, B, all allowed.

Moreover, if we get feedback, we can see which letters are correct.

Another word: ""JOKER"" but J and K are less common. Also, J not eliminated? But we might avoid less common.

""SOBER"" seems good.

Another common word: ""SUPER"" -> S, U, P, E, R -> tests U and P.

But ""SOBER"" tests O and B as well.

I think ""SOBER"" is fine.

So we'll guess ""SOBER"".

But note: we have to be cautious. The word must have exactly the pattern _ _ _ E R.

So: <guess>sober</guess>Based on the feedback from ""crane"" and ""tiger"":
- E and R are confirmed in positions 4 and 5, respectively (word ends with ""ER"").
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G (confirmed absent from the secret word).
- The first three letters must use untested common letters (avoiding E and R duplicates).

The word **""sober""** fits perfectly:
- Tests **S**, **O**, and **B** (common letters not previously tried).
- Maintains E in position 4 and R in position 5.
- Avoids all eliminated letters.

This choice will efficiently narrow down possibilities for positions 1–3 while leveraging known correct placements.

Guess 3: sober -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for three guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning:
- C: absent
- R: present but wrong position (not position 2)
- A: absent
- N: absent
- E: present but wrong position (not position 5)

Guess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
- T: absent
- I: absent
- G: absent
- E: correct at position 4
- R: correct at position 5

So the secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5. The word is _ _ _ E R.

Also, eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G.

Guess 3: sober -> Feedback: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
- S: absent
- O: correct at position 2 (since we put O in position 2 and it's marked correct)
- B: absent
- E: correct at position 4 (already known)
- R: correct at position 5 (already known)

Now, the secret word pattern is: _ O _ E R

We have:
- Position 2: O (now confirmed)
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

We need to find the first and third letters.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B (from guesses 1 and 3).

Also, we know that R and E are placed correctly, so the first and third positions cannot be R or E (unless duplicates, but feedback has not indicated any duplicates so far).

From guess 1, R was misplaced at position 2, but now we have O at position 2. Also, R is at position 5, so no duplicate R. Similarly, E is only at position 4.

So, the first and third positions must be letters that are not eliminated and not E, R, or O (since O is only in position 2).

Eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B.

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Now, we need to form a 5-letter word with the pattern: _ O _ E R.

The word must be valid English word.

We are missing the first and third letters.

So, we can list possible words:

For example:
- HOVER: H O V E R -> V not tested, but H is available? H, O, V? H at pos1, V at pos3? But we have O at 2? 
  Pattern: H O V E R -> positions: 1:H, 3:V.

Similarly:
- MOVER: M O V E R -> M at 1, V at 3.
- LOVER: L O V E R -> L at 1, V at 3.
- ROVER? But R is already at position 5, and we must avoid duplicate R? But we don't know. Also, in this case, if we try R at position 1, but R is in the word? We have R at position 5, so if there's another R, it might appear.

But from feedback, we didn't see duplicate R. In the first guess (crane) we had R at position 2 and got a '-', which already confirms at least one R. In the second guess (tiger) we had R at position 5 and got ✓. In the third guess (sober) we had R again at position 5 and ✓. But we didn't try R in multiple positions at the same guess, so we don't know if duplicate exists.

In guess1, if there were two R's, then putting one R in position 2 (if there was one R in position 2) would show one ✓ if correct? But it wasn't.

Actually, the feedback would show each occurrence. For example, if the word had two R's, and we guess one in the wrong position, it would show '-', and if we guess one in the correct position, it would show '✓'. But we have not guessed R in any position other than 2 and 5. Position 2 had '-' meaning that position was wrong and there might be another R? But we now have R at position 5, so the R in position 2 was wrong, but that doesn't necessarily imply two R's. It could be one R that is at position 5 and was masked as misplaced in position 2.

Actually, Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, it might mark both accordingly? But in this case, if there had been two R's, in the second guess when we put R only in position 5, it should show only one ✓? And if there was an additional R not guessed, it wouldn't show? Actually, no. The feedback marks only for letters present. If a letter appears twice in the secret word, and you guess it once, it will show the feedback only for the one you guessed? But I think it marks every occurrence.

Recall: in Wordle, if the secret word has a duplicate letter, and you guess that letter in one position, it might be marked once if only one instance is present? Actually, the feedback goes by the letter counts. So to be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.

But for efficiency, we can guess without duplicates for now.

So, we are looking for words of the form: [first] O [third] E R, with first and third from available letters: D,F,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Now, common words:
- HOVER: uses H and V.
- LOVER: uses L and V.
- MOVER: uses M and V.
- POWER: but P and W? Also, available? P yes, W yes? But note: P and W not eliminated. ""POWER"": P O W E R -> positions: P:1, W:3.
- However, we have not eliminated W? So it's possible.

But wait, let's list:

Common possibilities:
- HOVER: H and V
- JOKER: but J and K? And O? Position 2 is O? But JOKER: J O K E R, so J at 1, K at 3? But K? We haven't eliminated K? Guess: J and K are available? K not tested? But note, ""tiger"" had G eliminated, but not K? And ""sober"" had B and S eliminated but not K? So K is still available? Wait, is K eliminated? We eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B. So K is available.

Similarly, U is available? For LOVER? L O V E R -> L and V available? L not eliminated? V not eliminated?

Valid words:

- POWER: P O W E R -> P at 1, W at 3
- BOXER: but B is eliminated? No, in ""sober"" we got B(x) -> absent, so B is eliminated. So we cannot use B.

Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B.

Available: D,F,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.

Words:

- LOVER: L O V E R -> L at 1, V at 3 -> valid
- MOVER: M O V E R -> M at 1, V at 3 -> valid
- HOVER: H O V E R -> H at 1, V at 3 -> valid
- POWER: P O W E R -> P at 1, W at 3 -> valid
- MOWER: M O W E R -> M at 1, W at 3 -> valid
- JOKER: J O K E R -> J at 1, K at 3 -> valid
- COVER: but C is eliminated? C in cover is first letter? Eliminated, cannot.
- ROVER: R O V E R -> R at 1? But we already have R at 5? So duplicate R? And R in position 1? We don't know if duplicates are allowed? We can try, but we don't get extra information? And if R appears twice, but from previous feedback we saw only one R marked each time? Actually, in ""tiger"", we had R only at position 5 and it was marked ✓, but if there was a duplicate R at position 1, it wouldn't be marked because we didn't guess it? So we don't know.

But ""ROVER"" has two R's? And if we try it, we might get information about duplicate.

But let's avoid for now? We can test one of the letters.

Since we have only two positions open, and we know the word, we can test one and next guess the other.

But we want to get it in as few guesses as possible.

Another word: ""FOWLER""? Too long.

Only 5 letters.

We have limited choices: first letter can be any available except O,E,R? And third letter any available except O,E,R.

We can choose words that test common letters? 

We need to guess both positions simultaneously? Because we have two guesses left? Wait, we have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 left? But we want to be efficient.

Given available letters, try to cover more common letters? For example, we haven't tested L, M, P, V, W, etc.

We can guess a word with L? Or M? Or more?

But we guess only one letter for each position? 

Since there are multiple possibilities, we can try a word that might help differentiate? 

But we need to pick a word that fits the pattern? Let's list possible words:

Possible words:
- HOVER
- JOKER
- LOVER
- MOVER
- POWER
- MOWER
- TOWER? But T is eliminated? T is gone, so no.

- DOVER? D O V E R -> D and V available? D? D not tested? Valid? Place name, I think.

But let's stick to common words.

- POWER, LOVER, MOVER are common.

We need to choose one? How about ""LOVER""? Uses L and V? Or ""MOVER""? or ""POWER""?

But we also have to avoid putting eliminated letters.

We can choose ""POWER"" to test P and W? Or ""LOVER"" to test L and V? Etc.

Now, if we choose ""POWER"" and the feedback shows P correct? Then we know P is at position1? But we are trying to get the first letter?

Similarly, we can choose a word that includes a vowel? But position1 and 3? Consonants or vowels.

Vowels left: U? And sometimes Y.

But we have U? Like in ""MOURNER""? Not 5 letters.

We can choose ""LOVER"", which uses L and V? Then if L is absent? Then we eliminate V? Or something?

But we get feedback per letter? Meaning:

If we guess ""LOVER"", feedback for:
- L: either ✓ if first position correct? or '-' if misplaced? or x if absent.
- O: already known and confirmed ✓ (we already know it's correct, so feedback for O will be ✓ again? but that's redundant).
- V: for third position?
- E and R: known ✓.

So we get new feedback for L and V.

Similarly for other guesses.

We can choose any word? But we must have O, E, R in positions 2,4,5.

So we can pick:

Option 1: ""LOVER"" -> guess: L O V E R
Then feedback:
- Position 1: L: will tell if L is in the word? And if at position 1?
- Position 3: V: similarly.

If L is ✓ at position1, we solved; if x, then L not present? But if it is misplaced? Then L is in the word but not at position 1? Then we have to use it in another position? But the only unknown positions are 1 and 3? And position 3 would be for V? But if L is misplaced? Then it should be at position 3? Which conflicts with V? Actually, we are putting L at position1 and V at position3. If L should be at position3, then we'd get L: '-' for position1, and V: x or etc.

But there are words: for example, if the word is ""MOVER"", then ""LOVER"" would have:
- L: x (since M at position1)
- V: ? 

But the secret word ""MOVER"": third letter is V? So for ""LOVER"" guessing on MOVER? Then:
- L at position1: absent? Secret has M at position1? So L:x? 
- V at position3: secret has V? At position3? So ✓? Then feedback: L(x), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓), R(✓)

And we know the first letter is wrong? Then next guess we try alternatives: M?

But we have a small list.

Similarly, if we guess ""LOVER"" and the feedback is:
- L: ✓? Then solved: LOVER is the word? Then all ✓? Or if L: '-'? Then L might be at position3? Then the word would have to be something like ? O L E R? For example, ""DOLLER""? Not a common word? Or ""POLER""? But P? Or ""DROLL""? Not pattern? So probably not?

But let's list words that end with O?ER? Actually, the pattern is first letter unknown, second O, third unknown, fourth E, fifth R.

So words: POWER, MOVER, HOVER, LOVER, JOKER, MOWER, COVER but C eliminated, DOVER, ROVER.

With ROVER: duplicate R? But possible? R at1 and R at5? Then the feedback for ""ROVER"" would have two ✓ for R? One at position1? And one at position5? But in previous guesses, when we had one R, it showed one? But now? Let's be cautious.

We already have R at position5, so R at position1 would be a duplicate? The secret word could be ""ROVER""?

But from the first guess: ""crane"" had R at position2? And feedback was '-'? Meaning there is an R not at position2? If the secret word is ""ROVER"", it has R at positions 1 and 5? Then in ""crane"", we guessed R at position2? Which is not correct? And R at position2? But secret has R at position1? Then feedback should have one '-' for R? Which it did? And the other R was not guessed? So it didn't show? So possible.

Similarly, E: only one? At position4? In ""ROVER"", E is at position4? So pattern matches.

So ""ROVER"" is a possibility? But R at position1? And in the first guess? We didn't guess position1? So how would we know? It's a possibility.

Similarly, other words.

But ""ROVER"" uses R? Which we haven't placed at position1? We eliminated? R is present? But we are putting it again? So it's a test.

To avoid duplicates? But sometimes Wordle allows duplicates.

Since we have eliminated many letters, the possibilities are:

Common words fitting the pattern:
- POWER (if P and W not eliminated)
- MOVER (M and V)
- LOVER (L and V)
- HOVER (H and V)
- JOKER (J and K)
- MOWER (M and W)
- DOVER (D and V) – Dover is a place name
- ROVER (duplicate R)

We also know from guess1 that R was misplaced at position2? But now in ROVER? R at position1: if we had guessed ""crane"" with R at2? Secret is ROVER: position1 R? And position5 R? So the R in ""crane"" position2? Compared to secret: position2 in secret is O? So no R there? So it is misplaced (should be position1)? So '-' is correct? And the duplicate R at position5? Not guessed? So no problem? So possible.

Similarly, is ""ROVER"" a valid word? Yes.

Now, we have to choose one word to guess.

We can choose a word that uses letters we haven't seen? And avoid rare letters? For example, ROVER uses R again? Which we already know? So it doesn't test new letters? Unless we want to confirm duplicate? But better to test new letters? Then POWER, LOVER, etc.

Given that we don't know L, V, M? Etc.

How about we guess ""MOVER""? Uses M and V? Both new.

Similarly, ""POWER"" uses P and W.

But we have used? Let's see feedback we can get.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that tries only one new letter? But that might not help? Because we have two positions.

The best is to pick one that we think is likely? But we don't have frequency.

We can choose ""POWER"" because P and W are common letters? Or ""LOVER""?

But note that we have two guesses left? So we can risk one possibility? 

Actually, we should maximize information? But the word might be one of these.

We know the third letter? In the pattern? We need to find it.

Let's look at guess1: we had E as present? But not at position5? But we have it at4? R as present? Not at2? But at5? So we didn't guess position1 and 3? So we can try any.

Option: guess ""JOKER""? J Q K? J rare? So probably not.

But let's be systematic.

We can eliminate by commonality? For example, ""HOVER"", ""MOVER"", ""POWER"", ""LOVER"", ""MOWER"" are common.

We don't know? How about ""LOVER"" as it has LV? Which are common.

But we can also see if there is a word that uses a letter we might have from before? Not really.

With six guesses, we have tries? We have used 3, so we have 3 left? But to be safe, we should try to solve.

We can guess ""POWER"" and see if we get PW.

So, i choose ""LOVER""? Let's don't.

Another constraint? From first guess: We had E misplaced? But in LOVER, E is at4? And that's fixed.

Similarly, all set.

I think ""MOVER"" is a good choice? Because M and V are common? Or perhaps ""POWER""?

But let's look at the available letters? We have P and W, both common.

""POWER"" is more common than ""MOVER""? According to frequency? But I don't know? 

To decide: we can choose ""POWER"" because if it's not that, we can try others?

So, let's guess ""POWER"".

Pattern: P O W E R

So, guess: <guess>power</guess> 

But we must check: P is not eliminated? W is not eliminated? Correct? Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B. So P and W are allowed.

And if feedback? For ""POWER"" guessed on, say, a secret word ""MOVER""? Then feedback:
- P: x? (since M at 1)
- O? ✓
- W: x? since V at 3? 
- E✓, R✓

But W not in the word? Then we know not POWER? Then next guess? But we have three positions? Only one and three? M and so we guess MOVER? Or similar.

Alternatively, if we guess ""LOVER"" and secret is ""MOVER"", then:
- L: x? 
- O✓
- V: but secret has V? At position3? Then ✓? So feedback: L(x), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> so we know the word is ? O V E R? With ? not L? So first letter could be H, M, etc? Then we guess MOVER? Then?

Similarly? I think ""POWER"" or ""LOVER"" are fine.

Let's go with ""POWER"".From the feedback:
- **E** is confirmed in position 4 and **R** in position 5 (word ends with ""ER"").
- **O** is now confirmed in position 2, so the word pattern is **? O ? E R**.
- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B (absent from the word).
- Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

This leaves the first and third positions to be solved. Common words fitting the pattern include:
- **POWER**: Tests **P** and **W** (both untested common letters).  
- **LOVER**: Tests **L** and **V**.  
- **MOVER**: Tests **M** and **V**.  
- **HOVER**: Tests **H** and **V**.  

Guessing **""POWER""** maximizes information by:
- Testing **P** (position 1) and **W** (position 3), which are high-frequency consonants.  
- Covering the pattern without duplicates (since duplicate R isn't indicated by feedback).  

If incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., LOVER/MOVER) efficiently.

<guess>power</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Guess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 3: sober -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Guess 4: power -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have the feedback from four guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning: 
  - C, A, N are absent.
  - R is present but not in position 2.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - T, I, G are absent.
  - E is correct at position 4.
  - R is correct at position 5.

So the secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5: pattern _ _ _ E R.

Guess 3: sober -> Feedback: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - S and B are absent.
  - O is correct at position 2.
  - E and R are correct (positions 4 and 5, already known).

So now the pattern is _ O _ E R.

Guess 4: power -> Feedback: P(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - P is absent.
  - O is correct at position 2 (already known).
  - W is correct at position 3 (since we placed W in position 3 and got ✓).
  - E and R are correct (positions 4 and 5).

So now we know:
  - The secret word has W in position 3.
  - The pattern is _ O W E R.

We only need to find the first letter.

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B, P (from all feedback).

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

But the first letter must be one that forms a valid English word with ""OWER"" (since positions 2,3,4,5 are O,W,E,R).

We know the word ends with ""OWER"", so the first letter must be a letter that makes a 5-letter word.

Common words: 
  - POWER (but P is eliminated, and we just guessed it and P is absent, so not POWER)
  - TOWER (T is eliminated)
  - LOWER: L is available? L not eliminated? Yes, so LOWER is a possibility.
  - MOWER: M available? Yes.
  - COVER: C eliminated.
  - HOVER: H available? Yes.
  - JOKER: J and K? But the pattern is O W E R? JOKER is J O K E R, but we have W at position 3? So not? Because we have W at position 3? So the word must be ? O W E R.

So the third letter is W, so the word is ? O W E R.

What words have the pattern ?OWER? 

- LOWER: L O W E R
- MOWER: M O W E R
- SOWER: S is eliminated? S was absent in guess3.
- TOWER: T eliminated.
- BOWER: B eliminated.
- POWER: P eliminated.
- COVER: C eliminated and also pattern is C O V E R, not O W E R? So no.

So the only common words are LOWER and MOWER? 

But are there others? 
- DOWER: D O W E R? D is available? D not eliminated? And DOWER is a word (meaning a widow's share of property or to endow).
- HOWER? Not a word.
- JOWER? Not a word.
- KOWER? Not a word.
- VOWER? Not a word.
- ROWER: R O W E R? But R is at position 5? So duplicate R? And R at position 1? But we have R at position 5? So ROWER? Is that a word? Yes, meaning one who rows a boat.

But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But from feedback, we haven't seen duplicate R? But it's possible.

Similarly, FOWER? Not a word? Or YOWER? Not common.

So possible words: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.

But we have eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B,P.

So available: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

So L, M, D, R (but R is already present? So ROWER would have two R's) are possible.

But we must choose one? We have two guesses left? We can try one.

But note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2? And it was misplaced? If the secret word is ROWER, then R at position 1? And position 5? So in the first guess, we put R at position 2? Which is not correct? So it was marked as present but wrong position? And the R at position 1 was not guessed? So it didn't show? So possible? But we also have to consider that in the secret word, position 2 is O? So in ""crane"", position 2 was R? But secret has O? So R at position 2 is wrong? So the '-' is correct? So ROWER is a possibility.

Similarly, for LOWER, MOWER, DOWER.

Now, we need to guess one? How to choose? We can try LOWER? Because L is a common letter? Or MOWER? M is common.

But we can also consider that we have not tested L, M, D? So we can try one.

But if we guess LOWER and it's wrong? Then we know it's one of the others? But we have two guesses left? So we can try.

Alternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven't used? But we only have one letter to guess? The first letter? So we have to pick one.

We can try ""LOWER"" first? Then if not, ""MOWER"" next? Or ""DOWER""? 

But let's see if there is a word that can test multiple? But we can't? Because the pattern is fixed: ?OWER.

So we must guess one of the possibilities.

I think ""LOWER"" is a common word? So let's try that.

But we must check: L is not eliminated? Correct? So:

Guess: LOWER

But LOWER: L O W E R -> positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R.

If the secret word is LOWER, we get all ✓? If not, then we get feedback on L? If L is absent? Or misplaced? But if absent, then we know L is not the first letter? And not in the word? Then we can try MOWER? Or DOWER? Or ROWER.

But if L is absent? Then the word must be MOWER or DOWER or ROWER? But we have to see the feedback.

But in the feedback for LOWER, if L is absent, then we get:
- L: x
- O: ✓
- W: ✓
- E: ✓
- R: ✓

Then we know the first letter is not L? And L is absent? So the word must be MOWER, DOWER, or ROWER? Then we can try MOWER next? If MOWER is wrong? Then DOWER or ROWER? But we have one guess left? So we might not get it? But we have two guesses after this? We have used 4, so 2 left? So we can try two? But if we have three possibilities? We might not get it in two? But we have two guesses? So if we guess LOWER and it's wrong? Then we have two possibilities? Then we can try one? And if wrong? Then the last one? But we have only one guess left? So we can only try one? Then if wrong? We lose? But we have two guesses left? After guess4, we have two guesses? So we can make two more? So we can try two of the three? But we have three possibilities? So we might not get it? But let's list:

Possibilities: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? Four? Oh, I forgot ROWER.

So four possibilities? But we have two guesses? So we might not cover all? But we can try to choose a word that is not one of them? But we have to fit the pattern? We cannot? Because the pattern is fixed? We have to guess a word that has O W E R in positions 2,3,4,5? So the only freedom is the first letter? And we have to choose from the available letters that form words.

But we don't know which letters form words? We have to rely on common words.

Common words: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? And maybe others? But I think that's it.

But we can try to guess a word that has a different first letter? But that is not a valid word? Then it would be invalid? So we must guess one of the valid words.

So we have to choose one? And hope? Or choose one that covers more information? But we can't? Because the only information is the first letter.

So let's try the most common one? LOWER? Or MOWER?

According to word frequency? LOWER is more common? Or MOWER? I think both are common.

But we can consider the first guess? We had R at position2? And it was misplaced? If the word is ROWER, then R at position1? So we might have a duplicate? But we don't know? So perhaps avoid ROWER for now? Because duplicates are less common? So try LOWER or MOWER first.

But we have to choose? Let's try LOWER.

So guess: <guess>lower</guess>

But if it's wrong? Then we have MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? Then we can try MOWER? If wrong? Then we have DOWER and ROWER? But we have only one guess left? So we have to choose between DOWER and ROWER? And we might be wrong? But DOWER is less common? So we might choose ROWER? But it's risky.

Alternatively, we can try a word that is not of the pattern? But we know the pattern? So we must use the pattern? Because we know O,W,E,R are fixed? So we have to guess the first letter? So we cannot avoid.

But we can try to guess a word that has the same letters? But no? Because the positions are fixed.

So we have to guess one of the possibilities.

But note: in the feedback for ""power"", we got W(✓) at position3? So W is fixed? So we cannot change.

So I think we must guess one of LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.

But to be safe? We can try a word that uses a letter that is not in the possibilities? But that would be invalid? Because the first letter must be one that forms a word.

So let's list the possible first letters: L, M, D, R.

We have not tested L, M, D? R is known to be in the word? But at position5? So if we use R at position1? It might be duplicate.

But we can try ""ROWER"" as a guess? Because if it's correct? We win? If not? Then we get feedback? If R is absent? Then we know no duplicate? Then the word must be LOWER, MOWER, or DOWER? But then we have three possibilities and one guess? We cannot cover? So we lose? So it's risky.

If we guess ""ROWER"" and it's not the word? Then feedback:
- R: if the word has no duplicate? Then R at position1 is absent? So x? Then we know R is only at position5? Then the word is LOWER, MOWER, or DOWER? But we have one guess left? We have to choose one? And we might be wrong.

So better to guess a word that is not ROWER? So that if it's wrong? We eliminate one letter? Then we have two guesses for the remaining? But we have only one guess left after that? So we can cover two? But there are three? So we might not.

But let's count the possibilities: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? Four? But we have two guesses? So we can cover two? But if we guess one? And it's wrong? Then we have three left? And one guess? We can only cover one? So we lose? Unless we guess correctly.

But we don't know which one? So we need a different strategy? But we cannot? Because the pattern is fixed.

Perhaps there is another word? For example, ""VOWER""? Not a word? Or ""HOWE R""? Not.

Or ""FOW E R""? Not.

I think the only common words are LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.

But DOWER is less common? So perhaps we can ignore it? Or not.

Another word: ""SOWER"" but S is eliminated? So not.

""TOWER"" T eliminated.

""BOWER"" B eliminated.

So only LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.

But DOWER is a valid word? Yes.

Now, to maximize our chances? We can guess the most common one? According to word frequency? 

In English, ""lower"" is more common than ""mower"", ""dower"", ""rower"".

For example, ""lower"" is an adjective, verb? Common.

""Mower"" is a noun, less common.

""Dower"" is legal term, less common.

""Rower"" is a person, less common.

So we should guess ""LOWER"" first.

If it's not, then we guess ""MOWER"" next? Then if not, we have DOWER and ROWER? But we have only two guesses? After LOWER, if wrong, we have one guess? Then we can guess ""MOWER""? If wrong, we lose? But we have two possibilities left? DOWER and ROWER? So we cannot cover? So we might lose.

But we have to hope that it's LOWER or MOWER? Or we can guess a word that is not of the pattern? But we cannot? Because we know the pattern.

Unless we guess a word that has the same letters but different positions? But we know the positions of O,W,E,R? So we cannot change? Because they are fixed.

For example, if we guess ""MOWER"" and it's not the word? Then we get feedback? If M is absent? Then we know M is not first? And not in the word? Then we can try LOWER? Or if M is present but not at position1? But position1 is the only unknown? So if M is absent? Then we know M is not the first letter? And not in the word? Then we can try LOWER? But LOWER might be the word? Or DOWER? Or ROWER.

But if we guess ""MOWER"" and get:
- M: x? Then M is absent? So the word is not MOWER? And M not in word? Then we try LOWER? If LOWER is not? Then we have DOWER and ROWER? But one guess left? We can only try one? So we might lose.

Similarly, if we guess ""LOWER"" and get L: x? Then L absent? Then we try MOWER? If MOWER is not? Then we have DOWER and ROWER? Same problem.

So to avoid this? We can try to guess a word that has a letter that is in multiple possibilities? But the first letter is different for each? So we cannot.

Another idea: guess a word that is not in the possibilities? But that has the pattern? But we have to guess a valid word? And we listed the valid ones.

Perhaps ""COWER""? But C eliminated? And pattern is C O W E R? But we have W at position3? So it fits? But C is eliminated? So not.

Or ""HOWE R""? Not 5 letters? ""HOWER"" not a word.

So I think we have to guess one? And hope.

But let's see the feedback from guess1: we had E and R present? But we have them fixed? And O and W are new? But we have them fixed.

Perhaps we can consider that in the first guess, we had no information about position1 and 3? But now we have position3 fixed as W.

So I think we must guess.

Let's guess ""LOWER"" as it is the most common.

So <guess>lower</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback

- **Guess 1: crane**  
  Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  
  Interpretation:  
  - C, A, N are **absent** from the word.  
  - R is **present** but not in position 2.  
  - E is **present** but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: tiger**  
  Feedback: T(x), I(x), G(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - T, I, G are **absent**.  
  - E is **correct** at position 4.  
  - R is **correct** at position 5.  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ E R`.  

- **Guess 3: sober**  
  Feedback: S(x), O(✓), B(x), E(✓), R(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - S and B are **absent**.  
  - O is **correct** at position 2.  
  - E and R are **correct** (positions 4 and 5).  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ O _ E R`.  

- **Guess 4: power**  
  Feedback: P(x), O(✓), W(✓), E(✓), R(✓)  
  Interpretation:  
  - P is **absent**.  
  - O is **correct** at position 2 (already known).  
  - W is **correct** at position 3.  
  - E and R are **correct** (positions 4 and 5).  
  - Secret word pattern: `_ O W E R`.  

### Current Knowledge
- **Confirmed positions**:  
  - Position 2: **O**  
  - Position 3: **W**  
  - Position 4: **E**  
  - Position 5: **R**  
- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B, P (all marked ""x"" in previous feedback).  
- **Available letters for position 1**: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (not eliminated and not already placed).  
- **Secret word pattern**: `? O W E R`.  
- **Possible words**: Only valid English words fitting `?OWER` with the first letter from the available set. Common options:  
  - `LOWER` (L is available and common).  
  - `MOWER` (M is available).  
  - `DOWER` (D is available, but less common).  
  - `ROWER` (R is available, but duplicate R; possible but less likely based on feedback).  

### Strategy for Next Guess
- We need to guess the first letter. With only one unknown position, we must test one of the possible words.  
- **Why not guess a non-pattern word?**  
  The pattern `?OWER` is fixed (positions 2–5 confirmed), so any guess must match this to be valid. Guessing a non-pattern word would waste a turn and not provide useful information for position 1.  
- **Prioritization**:  
  - `LOWER` is the most common word fitting the pattern (e.g., ""lower"" as an adjective/verb).  
  - If `LOWER` is incorrect, feedback will confirm if L is absent or misplaced, narrowing to `MOWER`, `DOWER`, or `ROWER` for the final guess.  
- **Risk assessment**:  
  - We have 2 guesses left (after this one). If `LOWER` is wrong, feedback will eliminate L, and we can guess `MOWER` next (as the next most common option).  
  - If both `LOWER` and `MOWER` fail, `DOWER` or `ROWER` would be the last resort, but this is unlikely given their lower frequency.  

### Next Guess: `LOWER`
- Tests L in position 1.  
- If correct, we solve the puzzle.  
- If incorrect, feedback on L (absent or misplaced) will directly identify the first letter from the remaining options.

Does not contain C, A, N.\n 2. Contains R and E (but not in the positions we already tried for them? Actually, we know R is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5, but they could be in other positions).\n\n We also want to try to place R and E in new positions and include other common letters to get more information.\n\n Let\'s think about the positions:\n - R was in position 2 in ""crane"" -> so in the secret word, R is not in position 2. Therefore, R must be in one of positions 1, 3, 4, or 5.\n - E was in position 5 in ""crane"" -> so in the secret word, E is not in position 5. Therefore, E must be in one of positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n We can also consider that the word has 5 letters and we have two of them (R and E) but we don\'t know the other three.\n\n Since we have eliminated C, A, N, we can avoid those.\n\n Let\'s think of a word that includes R and E, and uses other common letters (like S, T, L, O, etc.) and that doesn\'t have C, A, N.\n\n We also want to try to place R and E in positions we haven\'t tried for them. For example, we can try R in position 1, 3, or 4 and E in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but not the same as R).\n\n Some words that come to mind:\n\n Option 1: ""ROLES"" -> \n   R in position 1 (which is a new position for R, since previously we had it in position 2 and now we try position 1)\n   O is a new letter\n   L is new\n   E in position 4 (previously we had E in position 5, so position 4 is new for E)\n   S is new\n\n But note: we don\'t know if O, L, S are in the word or not.\n\n Option 2: ""STORE"" -> \n   S in 1, T in 2, O in 3, R in 4, E in 5 -> but wait, we know E is not in position 5 (from previous feedback). So we cannot put E in position 5 again? Actually, we can, but we know it\'s not there so it would be a waste. We should avoid putting E in position 5.\n\n So let\'s avoid putting E in position 5 and R in position 2.\n\n Another option: ""TRIED"" -> \n   T in 1, R in 2 -> but we know R is not in position 2? Actually, we had R in position 2 and got a \'-\' meaning it\'s present but not in that position. So we should avoid putting R in position 2 again? Actually, we can, but it would be inefficient because we know it\'s not there. So better to put R in a new position.\n\n Therefore, let\'s avoid position 2 for R and position 5 for E.\n\n I think ""ROLES"" is a good candidate because:\n   R is in position 1 (new for R)\n   E is in position 4 (new for E, previously we had it in 5)\n   We are testing O, L, S.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""RICES"" but that has C and we know C is not in the word. So we must avoid C, A, N.\n\n Another word: ""ROUTE"" -> \n   R in 1, O in 2, U in 3, T in 4, E in 5 -> but E is in position 5 which we know is wrong. So avoid.\n\n How about ""RIPER""? But that has two R\'s and we don\'t know if the word has two R\'s. Also, we have only one R so far. But the feedback doesn\'t tell us about duplicates. Actually, the feedback might not account for duplicates properly. So it\'s better to avoid duplicates for now.\n\n Another idea: ""RISES"" -> but we have S twice? And we don\'t know if S is in the word. Also, R in position 1, I in 2, S in 3, E in 4, S in 5. But we are avoiding E in 5? Actually, E is in 4, which is good. But we have two S\'s. Let\'s avoid duplicates for now.\n\n How about ""ROBES""? \n   R in 1, O in 2, B in 3, E in 4, S in 5 -> E is in 4 (good) and S in 5 (new). But we are testing O and B.\n\n But note: we don\'t know if the word has O or B.\n\n Alternatively, we can try a word that has E in a different position and R in a different position, and also test other common letters.\n\n Another common word: ""TIGER"" -> \n   T in 1, I in 2, G in 3, E in 4, R in 5 -> \n   Here, R is in position 5 (which is new for R) and E is in position 4 (new for E). Also, we test T, I, G.\n\n But note: we have to avoid A, C, N. T, I, G are not in the forbidden list.\n\n However, we have to make sure the word is valid.\n\n Let me check: ""TIGER"" is a valid word.\n\n But wait: we are putting R in position 5 and E in position 4. We know from the first guess that E is in the word but not in position 5, so position 4 is a good try. And R is not in position 2, so position 5 is a new position for R.\n\n So ""TIGER"" seems good.\n\n Alternatively, we can try ""RIPEN"" but that has N which we know is not in the word. So avoid.\n\n Another option: ""ROBES"" as above.\n\n But I think ""TIGER"" is a good choice because it tests T, I, G and places R and E in new positions.\n\n However, note that the secret word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have any indication of duplicates so far, so we assume no duplicates for now.\n\n Let\'s go with ""TIGER"".\n\n But wait: what if the secret word has the letter E in position 4? Then we get a check. Similarly for R in position 5.\n\n We are also testing three new letters: T, I, G.\n\n So, next guess: ""TIGER""\n\n<guess>tiger</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C, A, and N are **not** in the secret word.\n- R is in the word but **not in position 2**.\n- E is in the word but **not in position 5**.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **R and E** (in positions other than 2 and 5, respectively).\n- Must exclude C, A, N.\n- Should test new common letters (e.g., T, I, G) to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""tiger""** fits these criteria:\n- Places R in position 5 (new position for R).\n- Places E in position 4 (new position for E).\n- Tests new letters T, I, G.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, A, N).\n\n<guess>tiger</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C: not in word\n- R: in word but not position 2\n- A: not in word\n- N: not in word\n- E: in word but not position 5\n\nGuess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nMeaning:\n- T: not in word\n- I: not in word\n- G: not in word\n- E: correct and in position 4 (since we placed E in position 4 and got ✓)\n- R: correct and in position 5 (since we placed R in position 5 and got ✓)\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word has E in the fourth position and R in the fifth position. So the word ends with ""E R"".\n- The third letter of the secret word is not G, and also not N (from first guess), and not I or any other eliminated letters.\n- The first letter is not C, A, T, or G (all eliminated).\n- Available letters: We know E and R are fixed at positions 4 and 5.\n\nWe also know from the first feedback that E is in the word (but not position 5, which we now know is position 4 fixed) and R is in the word (not position 2, and we now know it\'s in position 5).\n\nThe secret word pattern is: _ _ _ E R\n\nWe have eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G\n\nNow, we need to guess a word that fits _ _ _ E R and uses only letters that haven\'t been eliminated. We know that the missing three letters cannot be C, A, N, T, I, G.\n\nAlso, from the first guess, we had R in position 2 as a wrong position (but now we know R is in position 5, so that\'s consistent). We also had E in position 5 as wrong (now fixed at 4).\n\nSo we are missing the first three letters.\n\nWe must avoid: C, A, N, T, I, G.\n\nWe also know that R and E are already placed correctly, so the first three letters must not be R or E? Actually, they can be other occurrences? \n\nBut wait: we don\'t know if there are duplicate letters. In the feedback, we only got one R and one E marked. For example, in the first guess, we had only one R (at position 2) and one E (at position 5). Now in the second guess, we have E and R at positions 4 and 5 correct.\n\nIf there were duplicates, the feedback might not have shown them? Actually, the feedback would have shown duplicates. For instance, if the secret word had two R\'s, then if we guess one R in the correct position and one R in the wrong position, both would get marked accordingly. But in our case, we only have one R found. Similarly, only one E found.\n\nSo probably, there are no duplicates for R and E, meaning the first three letters are neither R nor E.\n\nTherefore, we must choose a word with three distinct letters (not eliminated, and not E or R) for the first three positions.\n\nLet\'s recall common English letters: We have vowels left: O, U. Consonants: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut we want common letters to maximize information.\n\nLet\'s form a word that ends with ""ER"".\n\nWe have to guess the first three letters.\n\nPossible words: \nFor example: LUMBER -> but we have U? And it\'s 6 letters? No, we need 5 letters: first three.\n\nList some 5-letter words ending with ""ER"":\n\n- Answer: AN?ER but A and N are eliminated, so not.\n- UDDER: but U, D, D -> D is available? And we can try U and D.\n\nBut let\'s think of common words.\n\nActually, we need to use available letters.\n\nWe know the following letters are eliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G.\n\nSo available: B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nWe should avoid using letters that are very rare? But let\'s find a valid word.\n\nWe can consider:\n\n- SOWER: S, O, W, E, R -> so pattern S O W E R -> positions: 1:S, 2:O, 3:W\n\nBut we don\'t know if S, O, W are in the word.\n\nSimilarly, another word: ""POWER"" -> P, O, W, E, R.\n\nOr ""LOWER"" -> L, O, W, E, R.\n\nBut we have multiple options. We need to choose one that tests letters we haven\'t tried.\n\nSince we know positions 4 and 5 are fixed, we only need to get the first three.\n\nTo maximize information, we should choose a word that includes common letters that haven\'t been tested.\n\nAlready tested letters (in first two guesses): C, R, A, N, E, T, I, G.\n\nSo untested common letters: S, L, O, U, D, M, B, etc.\n\nSo we can try a word that has several of these.\n\nFor example, with S, O, and L: we have ""SOLER""? Is that a word? Soler is not common. No.\n\n""SOBER"": S, O, B, E, R -> but E and R at 4 and 5 fixed? In ""SOBER"", E and R are at positions 4 and 5? Let\'s see:\nS at 1, O at 2, B at 3, E at 4, R at 5 -> perfect.\n\nAnd S, O, B are letters we haven\'t tested yet.\n\nSimilarly, other words: ""LOVER"": L, O, V, E, R -> V not tested.\n\nBut ""SOBER"" is a valid word meaning not intoxicated.\n\nAnother option: ""BOXER"", but we have X? Also, O and X.\n\nBut ""SOBER"" seems good.\n\nAlternatively, ""MOWER"": M, O, W, E, R -> M, W not tested.\n\nBut ""SOBER"" tests S, O, B.\n\nSince we have limited guesses, we want to get information.\n\nAlso, we must remember that the secret word must have the R and E, which we already have.\n\nNow, are there any constraints from the first guess? \n\nIn the first guess (crane), we had R at position 2 marked as present (but not placed). But now we have R at position 5. Since R is only present once, and now at 5, so that should be fine. The misplaced R at position 2 doesn\'t conflict because we have it at 5.\n\nSimilarly for E: in first guess E was at position 5 and misplaced, but now correctly placed at 4? \n\nWait, no. In the secret word, E is at position 4, so in the first guess we put E at position 5, which is wrong. And now we have it at 4. So all consistent.\n\nTherefore, a valid guess is ""SOBER"".\n\nBut we should consider that the first letter cannot be one of the eliminated? We must not use eliminated letters: so S, O, B are not eliminated (eliminated are C, A, N, T, I, G).\n\nSo ""SOBER"" uses S, O, B, all allowed.\n\nMoreover, if we get feedback, we can see which letters are correct.\n\nAnother word: ""JOKER"" but J and K are less common. Also, J not eliminated? But we might avoid less common.\n\n""SOBER"" seems good.\n\nAnother common word: ""SUPER"" -> S, U, P, E, R -> tests U and P.\n\nBut ""SOBER"" tests O and B as well.\n\nI think ""SOBER"" is fine.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""SOBER"".\n\nBut note: we have to be cautious. The word must have exactly the pattern _ _ _ E R.\n\nSo: <guess>sober</guess>Based on the feedback from ""crane"" and ""tiger"":\n- E and R are confirmed in positions 4 and 5, respectively (word ends with ""ER"").\n- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G (confirmed absent from the secret word).\n- The first three letters must use untested common letters (avoiding E and R duplicates).\n\nThe word **""sober""** fits perfectly:\n- Tests **S**, **O**, and **B** (common letters not previously tried).\n- Maintains E in position 4 and R in position 5.\n- Avoids all eliminated letters.\n\nThis choice will efficiently narrow down possibilities for positions 1–3 while leveraging known correct placements.\n\n<guess>sober</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 3: sober -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for three guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning:\n- C: absent\n- R: present but wrong position (not position 2)\n- A: absent\n- N: absent\n- E: present but wrong position (not position 5)\n\nGuess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nMeaning:\n- T: absent\n- I: absent\n- G: absent\n- E: correct at position 4\n- R: correct at position 5\n\nSo the secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5.

Also, R is at position 5, so no duplicate R. Similarly, E is only at position 4.\n\nSo, the first and third positions must be letters that are not eliminated and not E, R, or O (since O is only in position 2).\n\nEliminated: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B.\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nNow, we need to form a 5-letter word with the pattern: _ O _ E R.\n\nThe word must be valid English word.\n\nWe are missing the first and third letters.\n\nSo, we can list possible words:\n\nFor example:\n- HOVER: H O V E R -> V not tested, but H is available? H, O, V? H at pos1, V at pos3? But we have O at 2? \n  Pattern: H O V E R -> positions: 1:H, 3:V.\n\nSimilarly:\n- MOVER: M O V E R -> M at 1, V at 3.\n- LOVER: L O V E R -> L at 1, V at 3.\n- ROVER? But R is already at position 5, and we must avoid duplicate R? But we don\'t know. Also, in this case, if we try R at position 1, but R is in the word? We have R at position 5, so if there\'s another R, it might appear.\n\nBut from feedback, we didn\'t see duplicate R. In the first guess (crane) we had R at position 2 and got a \'-\', which already confirms at least one R. In the second guess (tiger) we had R at position 5 and got ✓. In the third guess (sober) we had R again at position 5 and ✓. But we didn\'t try R in multiple positions at the same guess, so we don\'t know if duplicate exists.\n\nIn guess1, if there were two R\'s, then putting one R in position 2 (if there was one R in position 2) would show one ✓ if correct? But it wasn\'t.\n\nActually, the feedback would show each occurrence. For example, if the word had two R\'s, and we guess one in the wrong position, it would show \'-\', and if we guess one in the correct position, it would show \'✓\'. But we have not guessed R in any position other than 2 and 5. Position 2 had \'-\' meaning that position was wrong and there might be another R? But we now have R at position 5, so the R in position 2 was wrong, but that doesn\'t necessarily imply two R\'s. It could be one R that is at position 5 and was masked as misplaced in position 2.\n\nActually, Wordle rules: for duplicate letters, it might mark both accordingly? But in this case, if there had been two R\'s, in the second guess when we put R only in position 5, it should show only one ✓? And if there was an additional R not guessed, it wouldn\'t show? Actually, no. The feedback marks only for letters present. If a letter appears twice in the secret word, and you guess it once, it will show the feedback only for the one you guessed? But I think it marks every occurrence.\n\nRecall: in Wordle, if the secret word has a duplicate letter, and you guess that letter in one position, it might be marked once if only one instance is present? Actually, the feedback goes by the letter counts. So to be safe, we should avoid assuming duplicates until necessary.\n\nBut for efficiency, we can guess without duplicates for now.\n\nSo, we are looking for words of the form: [first] O [third] E R, with first and third from available letters: D,F,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nNow, common words:\n- HOVER: uses H and V.\n- LOVER: uses L and V.\n- MOVER: uses M and V.\n- POWER: but P and W? Also, available? P yes, W yes? But note: P and W not eliminated. ""POWER"": P O W E R -> positions: P:1, W:3.\n- However, we have not eliminated W? So it\'s possible.\n\nBut wait, let\'s list:\n\nCommon possibilities:\n- HOVER: H and V\n- JOKER: but J and K? And O? Position 2 is O? But JOKER: J O K E R, so J at 1, K at 3? But K? We haven\'t eliminated K? Guess: J and K are available? K not tested? But note, ""tiger"" had G eliminated, but not K? And ""sober"" had B and S eliminated but not K? So K is still available? Wait, is K eliminated? We eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B. So K is available.\n\nSimilarly, U is available? For LOVER? L O V E R -> L and V available? L not eliminated? V not eliminated?\n\nValid words:\n\n- POWER: P O W E R -> P at 1, W at 3\n- BOXER: but B is eliminated? No, in ""sober"" we got B(x) -> absent, so B is eliminated. So we cannot use B.\n\nEliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B.\n\nAvailable: D,F,H,J,K,L,M,P,Q,U,V,W,X,Y,Z.\n\nWords:\n\n- LOVER: L O V E R -> L at 1, V at 3 -> valid\n- MOVER: M O V E R -> M at 1, V at 3 -> valid\n- HOVER: H O V E R -> H at 1, V at 3 -> valid\n- POWER: P O W E R -> P at 1, W at 3 -> valid\n- MOWER: M O W E R -> M at 1, W at 3 -> valid\n- JOKER: J O K E R -> J at 1, K at 3 -> valid\n- COVER: but C is eliminated? C in cover is first letter? Eliminated, cannot.\n- ROVER: R O V E R -> R at 1? But we already have R at 5? So duplicate R? And R in position 1? We don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? We can try, but we don\'t get extra information? And if R appears twice, but from previous feedback we saw only one R marked each time? Actually, in ""tiger"", we had R only at position 5 and it was marked ✓, but if there was a duplicate R at position 1, it wouldn\'t be marked because we didn\'t guess it? So we don\'t know.\n\nBut ""ROVER"" has two R\'s? And if we try it, we might get information about duplicate.\n\nBut let\'s avoid for now? We can test one of the letters.\n\nSince we have only two positions open, and we know the word, we can test one and next guess the other.\n\nBut we want to get it in as few guesses as possible.\n\nAnother word: ""FOWLER""? Too long.\n\nOnly 5 letters.\n\nWe have limited choices: first letter can be any available except O,E,R? And third letter any available except O,E,R.\n\nWe can choose words that test common letters? \n\nWe need to guess both positions simultaneously? Because we have two guesses left? Wait, we have used 3 guesses, so we have 3 left? But we want to be efficient.\n\nGiven available letters, try to cover more common letters? For example, we haven\'t tested L, M, P, V, W, etc.\n\nWe can guess a word with L? Or M? Or more?\n\nBut we guess only one letter for each position? \n\nSince there are multiple possibilities, we can try a word that might help differentiate? \n\nBut we need to pick a word that fits the pattern? Let\'s list possible words:\n\nPossible words:\n- HOVER\n- JOKER\n- LOVER\n- MOVER\n- POWER\n- MOWER\n- TOWER? But T is eliminated? T is gone, so no.\n\n- DOVER? D O V E R -> D and V available? D? D not tested? Valid? Place name, I think.\n\nBut let\'s stick to common words.\n\n- POWER, LOVER, MOVER are common.\n\nWe need to choose one? How about ""LOVER""? Uses L and V? Or ""MOVER""? or ""POWER""?\n\nBut we also have to avoid putting eliminated letters.\n\nWe can choose ""POWER"" to test P and W? Or ""LOVER"" to test L and V? Etc.\n\nNow, if we choose ""POWER"" and the feedback shows P correct? Then we know P is at position1? But we are trying to get the first letter?\n\nSimilarly, we can choose a word that includes a vowel? But position1 and 3? Consonants or vowels.\n\nVowels left: U? And sometimes Y.\n\nBut we have U? Like in ""MOURNER""? Not 5 letters.\n\nWe can choose ""LOVER"", which uses L and V? Then if L is absent? Then we eliminate V? Or something?\n\nBut we get feedback per letter? Meaning:\n\nIf we guess ""LOVER"", feedback for:\n- L: either ✓ if first position correct? or \'-\' if misplaced? or x if absent.\n- O: already known and confirmed ✓ (we already know it\'s correct, so feedback for O will be ✓ again? but that\'s redundant).\n- V: for third position?\n- E and R: known ✓.\n\nSo we get new feedback for L and V.\n\nSimilarly for other guesses.\n\nWe can choose any word? But we must have O, E, R in positions 2,4,5.\n\nSo we can pick:\n\nOption 1: ""LOVER"" -> guess: L O V E R\nThen feedback:\n- Position 1: L: will tell if L is in the word? And if at position 1?\n- Position 3: V: similarly.\n\nIf L is ✓ at position1, we solved; if x, then L not present? But if it is misplaced? Then L is in the word but not at position 1? Then we have to use it in another position? But the only unknown positions are 1 and 3? And position 3 would be for V? But if L is misplaced? Then it should be at position 3? Which conflicts with V? Actually, we are putting L at position1 and V at position3. If L should be at position3, then we\'d get L: \'-\' for position1, and V: x or etc.\n\nBut there are words: for example, if the word is ""MOVER"", then ""LOVER"" would have:\n- L: x (since M at position1)\n- V: ? \n\nBut the secret word ""MOVER"": third letter is V? So for ""LOVER"" guessing on MOVER? Then:\n- L at position1: absent? Secret has M at position1? So L:x? \n- V at position3: secret has V? At position3? So ✓? Then feedback: L(x), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓), R(✓)\n\nAnd we know the first letter is wrong? Then next guess we try alternatives: M?\n\nBut we have a small list.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""LOVER"" and the feedback is:\n- L: ✓? Then solved: LOVER is the word? Then all ✓? Or if L: \'-\'? Then L might be at position3? Then the word would have to be something like ? O L E R? For example, ""DOLLER""? Not a common word? Or ""POLER""? But P? Or ""DROLL""? Not pattern? So probably not?\n\nBut let\'s list words that end with O?ER? Actually, the pattern is first letter unknown, second O, third unknown, fourth E, fifth R.\n\nSo words: POWER, MOVER, HOVER, LOVER, JOKER, MOWER, COVER but C eliminated, DOVER, ROVER.\n\nWith ROVER: duplicate R? But possible? R at1 and R at5? Then the feedback for ""ROVER"" would have two ✓ for R? One at position1? And one at position5? But in previous guesses, when we had one R, it showed one? But now? Let\'s be cautious.\n\nWe already have R at position5, so R at position1 would be a duplicate? The secret word could be ""ROVER""?\n\nBut from the first guess: ""crane"" had R at position2? And feedback was \'-\'? Meaning there is an R not at position2? If the secret word is ""ROVER"", it has R at positions 1 and 5? Then in ""crane"", we guessed R at position2? Which is not correct? And R at position2? But secret has R at position1? Then feedback should have one \'-\' for R? Which it did? And the other R was not guessed? So it didn\'t show? So possible.\n\nSimilarly, E: only one? At position4? In ""ROVER"", E is at position4? So pattern matches.\n\nSo ""ROVER"" is a possibility? But R at position1? And in the first guess? We didn\'t guess position1? So how would we know? It\'s a possibility.\n\nSimilarly, other words.\n\nBut ""ROVER"" uses R? Which we haven\'t placed at position1? We eliminated? R is present? But we are putting it again? So it\'s a test.\n\nTo avoid duplicates? But sometimes Wordle allows duplicates.\n\nSince we have eliminated many letters, the possibilities are:\n\nCommon words fitting the pattern:\n- POWER (if P and W not eliminated)\n- MOVER (M and V)\n- LOVER (L and V)\n- HOVER (H and V)\n- JOKER (J and K)\n- MOWER (M and W)\n- DOVER (D and V) – Dover is a place name\n- ROVER (duplicate R)\n\nWe also know from guess1 that R was misplaced at position2? But now in ROVER? R at position1: if we had guessed ""crane"" with R at2? Secret is ROVER: position1 R? And position5 R? So the R in ""crane"" position2? Compared to secret: position2 in secret is O? So no R there? So it is misplaced (should be position1)? So \'-\' is correct? And the duplicate R at position5? Not guessed? So no problem? So possible.\n\nSimilarly, is ""ROVER"" a valid word? Yes.\n\nNow, we have to choose one word to guess.\n\nWe can choose a word that uses letters we haven\'t seen? And avoid rare letters? For example, ROVER uses R again? Which we already know? So it doesn\'t test new letters? Unless we want to confirm duplicate? But better to test new letters? Then POWER, LOVER, etc.\n\nGiven that we don\'t know L, V, M? Etc.\n\nHow about we guess ""MOVER""? Uses M and V? Both new.\n\nSimilarly, ""POWER"" uses P and W.\n\nBut we have used? Let\'s see feedback we can get.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word that tries only one new letter? But that might not help? Because we have two positions.\n\nThe best is to pick one that we think is likely? But we don\'t have frequency.\n\nWe can choose ""POWER"" because P and W are common letters? Or ""LOVER""?\n\nBut note that we have two guesses left? So we can risk one possibility? \n\nActually, we should maximize information? But the word might be one of these.\n\nWe know the third letter? In the pattern? We need to find it.\n\nLet\'s look at guess1: we had E as present? But not at position5? But we have it at4? R as present? Not at2? But at5? So we didn\'t guess position1 and 3? So we can try any.\n\nOption: guess ""JOKER""? J Q K? J rare? So probably not.\n\nBut let\'s be systematic.\n\nWe can eliminate by commonality? For example, ""HOVER"", ""MOVER"", ""POWER"", ""LOVER"", ""MOWER"" are common.\n\nWe don\'t know? How about ""LOVER"" as it has LV? Which are common.\n\nBut we can also see if there is a word that uses a letter we might have from before? Not really.\n\nWith six guesses, we have tries? We have used 3, so we have 3 left? But to be safe, we should try to solve.\n\nWe can guess ""POWER"" and see if we get PW.\n\nSo, i choose ""LOVER""? Let\'s don\'t.\n\nAnother constraint? From first guess: We had E misplaced? But in LOVER, E is at4? And that\'s fixed.\n\nSimilarly, all set.\n\nI think ""MOVER"" is a good choice? Because M and V are common? Or perhaps ""POWER""?\n\nBut let\'s look at the available letters? We have P and W, both common.\n\n""POWER"" is more common than ""MOVER""? According to frequency? But I don\'t know? \n\nTo decide: we can choose ""POWER"" because if it\'s not that, we can try others?\n\nSo, let\'s guess ""POWER"".\n\nPattern: P O W E R\n\nSo, guess: <guess>power</guess> \n\nBut we must check: P is not eliminated? W is not eliminated? Correct? Eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B. So P and W are allowed.\n\nAnd if feedback? For ""POWER"" guessed on, say, a secret word ""MOVER""? Then feedback:\n- P: x? (since M at 1)\n- O? ✓\n- W: x? since V at 3? \n- E✓, R✓\n\nBut W not in the word? Then we know not POWER? Then next guess? But we have three positions? Only one and three? M and so we guess MOVER? Or similar.\n\nAlternatively, if we guess ""LOVER"" and secret is ""MOVER"", then:\n- L: x? \n- O✓\n- V: but secret has V? At position3? Then ✓? So feedback: L(x), O(✓), V(✓), E(✓), R(✓) -> so we know the word is ? O V E R? With ? not L? So first letter could be H, M, etc? Then we guess MOVER? Then?\n\nSimilarly? I think ""POWER"" or ""LOVER"" are fine.\n\nLet\'s go with ""POWER"".From the feedback:\n- **E** is confirmed in position 4 and **R** in position 5 (word ends with ""ER"").\n- **O** is now confirmed in position 2, so the word pattern is **? O ? E R**.\n- Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B (absent from the word).\n- Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nThis leaves the first and third positions to be solved. Common words fitting the pattern include:\n- **POWER**: Tests **P** and **W** (both untested common letters).  \n- **LOVER**: Tests **L** and **V**.  \n- **MOVER**: Tests **M** and **V**.  \n- **HOVER**: Tests **H** and **V**.  \n\nGuessing **""POWER""** maximizes information by:\n- Testing **P** (position 1) and **W** (position 3), which are high-frequency consonants.  \n- Covering the pattern without duplicates (since duplicate R isn\'t indicated by feedback).  \n\nIf incorrect, the feedback will help narrow down the remaining possibilities (e.g., LOVER/MOVER) efficiently.\n\n<guess>power</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 3: sober -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: power -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have the feedback from four guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nMeaning: \n  - C, A, N are absent.\n  - R is present but not in position 2.\n  - E is present but not in position 5.\n\nGuess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nMeaning:\n  - T, I, G are absent.\n  - E is correct at position 4.\n  - R is correct at position 5.\n\nSo the secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5: pattern _ _ _ E R.\n\nGuess 3: sober -> Feedback: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nMeaning:\n  - S and B are absent.\n  - O is correct at position 2.\n  - E and R are correct (positions 4 and 5, already known).\n\nSo now the pattern is _ O _ E R.\n\nGuess 4: power -> Feedback: P(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)\nMeaning:\n  - P is absent.\n  - O is correct at position 2 (already known).\n  - W is correct at position 3 (since we placed W in position 3 and got ✓).\n  - E and R are correct (positions 4 and 5).\n\nSo now we know:\n  - The secret word has W in position 3.\n  - The pattern is _ O W E R.\n\nWe only need to find the first letter.\n\nEliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B, P (from all feedback).\n\nAvailable letters: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut the first letter must be one that forms a valid English word with ""OWER"" (since positions 2,3,4,5 are O,W,E,R).\n\nWe know the word ends with ""OWER"", so the first letter must be a letter that makes a 5-letter word.\n\nCommon words: \n  - POWER (but P is eliminated, and we just guessed it and P is absent, so not POWER)\n  - TOWER (T is eliminated)\n  - LOWER: L is available? L not eliminated? Yes, so LOWER is a possibility.\n  - MOWER: M available? Yes.\n  - COVER: C eliminated.\n  - HOVER: H available? Yes.\n  - JOKER: J and K? But the pattern is O W E R? JOKER is J O K E R, but we have W at position 3? So not? Because we have W at position 3? So the word must be ? O W E R.\n\nSo the third letter is W, so the word is ? O W E R.\n\nWhat words have the pattern ?OWER? \n\n- LOWER: L O W E R\n- MOWER: M O W E R\n- SOWER: S is eliminated? S was absent in guess3.\n- TOWER: T eliminated.\n- BOWER: B eliminated.\n- POWER: P eliminated.\n- COVER: C eliminated and also pattern is C O V E R, not O W E R? So no.\n\nSo the only common words are LOWER and MOWER? \n\nBut are there others? \n- DOWER: D O W E R? D is available? D not eliminated? And DOWER is a word (meaning a widow\'s share of property or to endow).\n- HOWER? Not a word.\n- JOWER? Not a word.\n- KOWER? Not a word.\n- VOWER? Not a word.\n- ROWER: R O W E R? But R is at position 5? So duplicate R? And R at position 1? But we have R at position 5? So ROWER? Is that a word? Yes, meaning one who rows a boat.\n\nBut we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? But from feedback, we haven\'t seen duplicate R? But it\'s possible.\n\nSimilarly, FOWER? Not a word? Or YOWER? Not common.\n\nSo possible words: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.\n\nBut we have eliminated: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B,P.\n\nSo available: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.\n\nSo L, M, D, R (but R is already present? So ROWER would have two R\'s) are possible.\n\nBut we must choose one? We have two guesses left? We can try one.\n\nBut note: in the first guess, we had R at position 2? And it was misplaced? If the secret word is ROWER, then R at position 1? And position 5? So in the first guess, we put R at position 2? Which is not correct? So it was marked as present but wrong position? And the R at position 1 was not guessed? So it didn\'t show? So possible? But we also have to consider that in the secret word, position 2 is O? So in ""crane"", position 2 was R? But secret has O? So R at position 2 is wrong? So the \'-\' is correct? So ROWER is a possibility.\n\nSimilarly, for LOWER, MOWER, DOWER.\n\nNow, we need to guess one? How to choose? We can try LOWER? Because L is a common letter? Or MOWER? M is common.\n\nBut we can also consider that we have not tested L, M, D? So we can try one.\n\nBut if we guess LOWER and it\'s wrong? Then we know it\'s one of the others? But we have two guesses left? So we can try.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that uses a letter we haven\'t used? But we only have one letter to guess? The first letter? So we have to pick one.\n\nWe can try ""LOWER"" first? Then if not, ""MOWER"" next? Or ""DOWER""? \n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that can test multiple? But we can\'t? Because the pattern is fixed: ?OWER.\n\nSo we must guess one of the possibilities.\n\nI think ""LOWER"" is a common word? So let\'s try that.\n\nBut we must check: L is not eliminated? Correct? So:\n\nGuess: LOWER\n\nBut LOWER: L O W E R -> positions: 1:L, 2:O, 3:W, 4:E, 5:R.\n\nIf the secret word is LOWER, we get all ✓? If not, then we get feedback on L? If L is absent? Or misplaced? But if absent, then we know L is not the first letter? And not in the word? Then we can try MOWER? Or DOWER? Or ROWER.\n\nBut if L is absent? Then the word must be MOWER or DOWER or ROWER? But we have to see the feedback.\n\nBut in the feedback for LOWER, if L is absent, then we get:\n- L: x\n- O: ✓\n- W: ✓\n- E: ✓\n- R: ✓\n\nThen we know the first letter is not L? And L is absent? So the word must be MOWER, DOWER, or ROWER? Then we can try MOWER next? If MOWER is wrong? Then DOWER or ROWER? But we have one guess left? So we might not get it? But we have two guesses after this? We have used 4, so 2 left? So we can try two? But if we have three possibilities? We might not get it in two? But we have two guesses? So if we guess LOWER and it\'s wrong? Then we have two possibilities? Then we can try one? And if wrong? Then the last one? But we have only one guess left? So we can only try one? Then if wrong? We lose? But we have two guesses left? After guess4, we have two guesses? So we can make two more? So we can try two of the three? But we have three possibilities? So we might not get it? But let\'s list:\n\nPossibilities: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? Four? Oh, I forgot ROWER.\n\nSo four possibilities? But we have two guesses? So we might not cover all? But we can try to choose a word that is not one of them? But we have to fit the pattern? We cannot? Because the pattern is fixed? We have to guess a word that has O W E R in positions 2,3,4,5? So the only freedom is the first letter? And we have to choose from the available letters that form words.\n\nBut we don\'t know which letters form words? We have to rely on common words.\n\nCommon words: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? And maybe others? But I think that\'s it.\n\nBut we can try to guess a word that has a different first letter? But that is not a valid word? Then it would be invalid? So we must guess one of the valid words.\n\nSo we have to choose one? And hope? Or choose one that covers more information? But we can\'t? Because the only information is the first letter.\n\nSo let\'s try the most common one? LOWER? Or MOWER?\n\nAccording to word frequency? LOWER is more common? Or MOWER? I think both are common.\n\nBut we can consider the first guess? We had R at position2? And it was misplaced? If the word is ROWER, then R at position1? So we might have a duplicate? But we don\'t know? So perhaps avoid ROWER for now? Because duplicates are less common? So try LOWER or MOWER first.\n\nBut we have to choose? Let\'s try LOWER.\n\nSo guess: <guess>lower</guess>\n\nBut if it\'s wrong? Then we have MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? Then we can try MOWER? If wrong? Then we have DOWER and ROWER? But we have only one guess left? So we have to choose between DOWER and ROWER? And we might be wrong? But DOWER is less common? So we might choose ROWER? But it\'s risky.\n\nAlternatively, we can try a word that is not of the pattern? But we know the pattern? So we must use the pattern? Because we know O,W,E,R are fixed? So we have to guess the first letter? So we cannot avoid.\n\nBut we can try to guess a word that has the same letters? But no? Because the positions are fixed.\n\nSo we have to guess one of the possibilities.\n\nBut note: in the feedback for ""power"", we got W(✓) at position3? So W is fixed? So we cannot change.\n\nSo I think we must guess one of LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.\n\nBut to be safe? We can try a word that uses a letter that is not in the possibilities? But that would be invalid? Because the first letter must be one that forms a word.\n\nSo let\'s list the possible first letters: L, M, D, R.\n\nWe have not tested L, M, D? R is known to be in the word? But at position5? So if we use R at position1? It might be duplicate.\n\nBut we can try ""ROWER"" as a guess? Because if it\'s correct? We win? If not? Then we get feedback? If R is absent? Then we know no duplicate? Then the word must be LOWER, MOWER, or DOWER? But then we have three possibilities and one guess? We cannot cover? So we lose? So it\'s risky.\n\nIf we guess ""ROWER"" and it\'s not the word? Then feedback:\n- R: if the word has no duplicate? Then R at position1 is absent? So x? Then we know R is only at position5? Then the word is LOWER, MOWER, or DOWER? But we have one guess left? We have to choose one? And we might be wrong.\n\nSo better to guess a word that is not ROWER? So that if it\'s wrong? We eliminate one letter? Then we have two guesses for the remaining? But we have only one guess left after that? So we can cover two? But there are three? So we might not.\n\nBut let\'s count the possibilities: LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? Four? But we have two guesses? So we can cover two? But if we guess one? And it\'s wrong? Then we have three left? And one guess? We can only cover one? So we lose? Unless we guess correctly.\n\nBut we don\'t know which one? So we need a different strategy? But we cannot? Because the pattern is fixed.\n\nPerhaps there is another word? For example, ""VOWER""? Not a word? Or ""HOWE R""? Not.\n\nOr ""FOW E R""? Not.\n\nI think the only common words are LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.\n\nBut DOWER is less common? So perhaps we can ignore it? Or not.\n\nAnother word: ""SOWER"" but S is eliminated? So not.\n\n""TOWER"" T eliminated.\n\n""BOWER"" B eliminated.\n\nSo only LOWER, MOWER, DOWER, ROWER.\n\nBut DOWER is a valid word? Yes.\n\nNow, to maximize our chances? We can guess the most common one? According to word frequency? \n\nIn English, ""lower"" is more common than ""mower"", ""dower"", ""rower"".\n\nFor example, ""lower"" is an adjective, verb? Common.\n\n""Mower"" is a noun, less common.\n\n""Dower"" is legal term, less common.\n\n""Rower"" is a person, less common.\n\nSo we should guess ""LOWER"" first.\n\nIf it\'s not, then we guess ""MOWER"" next? Then if not, we have DOWER and ROWER? But we have only two guesses? After LOWER, if wrong, we have one guess? Then we can guess ""MOWER""? If wrong, we lose? But we have two possibilities left? DOWER and ROWER? So we cannot cover? So we might lose.\n\nBut we have to hope that it\'s LOWER or MOWER? Or we can guess a word that is not of the pattern? But we cannot? Because we know the pattern.\n\nUnless we guess a word that has the same letters but different positions? But we know the positions of O,W,E,R? So we cannot change? Because they are fixed.\n\nFor example, if we guess ""MOWER"" and it\'s not the word? Then we get feedback? If M is absent? Then we know M is not first? And not in the word? Then we can try LOWER? Or if M is present but not at position1? But position1 is the only unknown? So if M is absent? Then we know M is not the first letter? And not in the word? Then we can try LOWER? But LOWER might be the word? Or DOWER? Or ROWER.\n\nBut if we guess ""MOWER"" and get:\n- M: x? Then M is absent? So the word is not MOWER? And M not in word? Then we try LOWER? If LOWER is not? Then we have DOWER and ROWER? But one guess left? We can only try one? So we might lose.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""LOWER"" and get L: x? Then L absent? Then we try MOWER? If MOWER is not? Then we have DOWER and ROWER? Same problem.\n\nSo to avoid this? We can try to guess a word that has a letter that is in multiple possibilities? But the first letter is different for each? So we cannot.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that is not in the possibilities? But that has the pattern? But we have to guess a valid word? And we listed the valid ones.\n\nPerhaps ""COWER""? But C eliminated? And pattern is C O W E R? But we have W at position3? So it fits? But C is eliminated? So not.\n\nOr ""HOWE R""? Not 5 letters? ""HOWER"" not a word.\n\nSo I think we have to guess one? And hope.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback from guess1: we had E and R present? But we have them fixed? And O and W are new? But we have them fixed.\n\nPerhaps we can consider that in the first guess, we had no information about position1 and 3? But now we have position3 fixed as W.\n\nSo I think we must guess.\n\nLet\'s guess ""LOWER"" as it is the most common.\n\nSo <guess>lower</guess>### Analysis of Previous Feedback\n\n- **Guess 1: crane**  \n  Feedback: C(x), R(-), A(x), N(x), E(-)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - C, A, N are **absent** from the word.  \n  - R is **present** but not in position 2.  \n  - E is **present** but not in position 5.  \n\n- **Guess 2: tiger**  \n  Feedback: T(x), I(x), G(x), E(✓), R(✓)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - T, I, G are **absent**.  \n  - E is **correct** at position 4.  \n  - R is **correct** at position 5.  \n  - Secret word pattern: `_ _ _ E R`.  \n\n- **Guess 3: sober**  \n  Feedback: S(x), O(✓), B(x), E(✓), R(✓)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - S and B are **absent**.  \n  - O is **correct** at position 2.  \n  - E and R are **correct** (positions 4 and 5).  \n  - Secret word pattern: `_ O _ E R`.  \n\n- **Guess 4: power**  \n  Feedback: P(x), O(✓), W(✓), E(✓), R(✓)  \n  Interpretation:  \n  - P is **absent**.  \n  - O is **correct** at position 2 (already known).  \n  - W is **correct** at position 3.  \n  - E and R are **correct** (positions 4 and 5).  \n  - Secret word pattern: `_ O W E R`.  \n\n### Current Knowledge\n- **Confirmed positions**:  \n  - Position 2: **O**  \n  - Position 3: **W**  \n  - Position 4: **E**  \n  - Position 5: **R**  \n- **Eliminated letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B, P (all marked ""x"" in previous feedback).  \n- **Available letters for position 1**: D, F, H, J, K, L, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z (not eliminated and not already placed).  \n- **Secret word pattern**: `?

If `LOWER` is wrong, feedback will eliminate L, and we can guess `MOWER` next (as the next most common option).  \n  - If both `LOWER` and `MOWER` fail, `DOWER` or `ROWER` would be the last resort, but this is unlikely given their lower frequency.  \n\n### Next Guess: `LOWER`\n- Tests L in position 1.  \n- If correct, we solve the puzzle.  \n- If incorrect, feedback on L (absent or misplaced) will directly identify the first letter from the remaining options.\n\n<guess>lower</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: tiger -> FEEDBACK: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 3: sober -> FEEDBACK: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 4: power -> FEEDBACK: P(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)\nGuess 5: lower -> FEEDBACK: L(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from five guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning: 
  - C, A, N are absent.
  - R is present but not in position 2.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - T, I, G are absent.
  - E is correct at position 4.
  - R is correct at position 5.

So the secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5: pattern _ _ _ E R.

Guess 3: sober -> Feedback: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - S and B are absent.
  - O is correct at position 2.
  - E and R are correct (positions 4 and 5).

So pattern: _ O _ E R.

Guess 4: power -> Feedback: P(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - P is absent.
  - O is correct at position 2 (already known).
  - W is correct at position 3.
  - E and R are correct.

So pattern: _ O W E R.

Guess 5: lower -> Feedback: L(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - L is absent.
  - O, W, E, R are correct (positions 2,3,4,5).

So now we know:
  - The secret word is ? O W E R.
  - The first letter is not L (and not any of the previously eliminated letters: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B,P,L).

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B, P, L.

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form ?OWER, where the first letter is one of the available letters.

Possible words:
- MOWER: M O W E R -> M is available? Yes, M not eliminated.
- DOWER: D O W E R -> D available? Yes.
- ROWER: R O W E R -> R is already in the word at position 5? So duplicate R? But R is not eliminated? We can try? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback hasn't indicated duplicate? But it's possible.
- Other? HOWER? Not a word. JOWER? Not. KOWER? Not. VOWER? Not. Etc.

So the only common words are MOWER, DOWER, and ROWER.

We have one guess left? We have used 5 guesses? So we have one more? So we must choose one of these.

Which one to choose?

We can consider:
- MOWER: M is a common letter? And we haven't tested M? So if we guess MOWER and it's wrong? Then we lose? But we have only one guess? So we must be correct.

But we don't know? So we have to pick the most likely.

Also, from the first guess: we had R at position2? And it was misplaced? If the word is ROWER, then R at position1? So duplicate R? Then in the first guess, we had R at position2? Which is not correct? So it was marked as present? But the R at position1 was not guessed? So it didn't show? So possible? But in the secret word, position2 is O? So R at position2 is wrong? So the '-' is correct? So ROWER is possible.

But let's see the frequency? MOWER is more common than DOWER? And ROWER is a noun? Also common? But MOWER (lawn mower) is common.

But we can also consider that in the feedback, we have not seen any duplicate? But we haven't tested.

Another thing: in the first guess, we had E at position5? And it was misplaced? But now we have E at position4? So if the word is ROWER? E is at position4? So that's fine.

But we have to choose? We can try MOWER? Because M is more common? Or DOWER is less common? So MOWER is better.

But let's see if there is a way? We have no more guesses to test? So we must guess.

I think MOWER is a good choice? Because DOWER is less common? And ROWER has duplicate? Which might be less likely? But we don't know.

But in the absence of information, we go with MOWER.

So guess: MOWER

But we must check: M is not eliminated? Correct? So:

<guess>mower</guess>

If it's not? Then we lose? But we have to try.

But let's list all possibilities: MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? And maybe others? But I think that's it.

So we choose MOWER.

### Analysis of Previous Feedback
- **Pattern Confirmed**: The secret word is `? O W E R` (positions 2–5 are fixed: **O**, **W**, **E**, **R**).  
- **Eliminated Letters**: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B, P, L (all marked ""x"" in feedback).  
- **Available Letters for Position 1**: D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.  
- **Possible Words**:  
  - `MOWER` (common: e.g., lawnmower).  
  - `DOWER` (less common: legal term for a widow's inheritance).  
  - `ROWER` (possible but less likely: duplicate R, as R is confirmed at position 5).  

### Strategy for Final Guess
- Only **one guess remains**, so we must choose the most probable word.  
- `MOWER` is the **most common word** fitting the pattern (higher frequency than `DOWER` or `ROWER`).  
- `ROWER` is riskier due to potential duplicate R (no prior feedback suggests duplicates).  
- If `MOWER` is incorrect, the answer is likely `DOWER` (though `ROWER` is possible).  

### Final Guess: `MOWER`
- Tests **M** in position 1.  
- If correct, the puzzle is solved. If not, `DOWER` or `ROWER` would be the answer (but we have no more guesses).  

<guess>mower</guess>",mower,"We have the feedback from five guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> Feedback: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(-)
Meaning: 
  - C, A, N are absent.
  - R is present but not in position 2.
  - E is present but not in position 5.

Guess 2: tiger -> Feedback: T(x) I(x) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - T, I, G are absent.
  - E is correct at position 4.
  - R is correct at position 5.

So the secret word has E at position 4 and R at position 5: pattern _ _ _ E R.

Guess 3: sober -> Feedback: S(x) O(✓) B(x) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - S and B are absent.
  - O is correct at position 2.
  - E and R are correct (positions 4 and 5).

So pattern: _ O _ E R.

Guess 4: power -> Feedback: P(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - P is absent.
  - O is correct at position 2 (already known).
  - W is correct at position 3.
  - E and R are correct.

So pattern: _ O W E R.

Guess 5: lower -> Feedback: L(x) O(✓) W(✓) E(✓) R(✓)
Meaning:
  - L is absent.
  - O, W, E, R are correct (positions 2,3,4,5).

So now we know:
  - The secret word is ? O W E R.
  - The first letter is not L (and not any of the previously eliminated letters: C,A,N,T,I,G,S,B,P,L).

Eliminated letters: C, A, N, T, I, G, S, B, P, L.

Available letters: D, F, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, X, Y, Z.

We need to find a 5-letter word of the form ?OWER, where the first letter is one of the available letters.

Possible words:
- MOWER: M O W E R -> M is available? Yes, M not eliminated.
- DOWER: D O W E R -> D available? Yes.
- ROWER: R O W E R -> R is already in the word at position 5? So duplicate R? But R is not eliminated? We can try? But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? But the feedback hasn't indicated duplicate? But it's possible.
- Other? HOWER? Not a word. JOWER? Not. KOWER? Not. VOWER? Not. Etc.

So the only common words are MOWER, DOWER, and ROWER.

We have one guess left? We have used 5 guesses? So we have one more? So we must choose one of these.

Which one to choose?

We can consider:
- MOWER: M is a common letter? And we haven't tested M? So if we guess MOWER and it's wrong? Then we lose? But we have only one guess? So we must be correct.

But we don't know? So we have to pick the most likely.

Also, from the first guess: we had R at position2? And it was misplaced? If the word is ROWER, then R at position1? So duplicate R? Then in the first guess, we had R at position2? Which is not correct? So it was marked as present? But the R at position1 was not guessed? So it didn't show? So possible? But in the secret word, position2 is O? So R at position2 is wrong? So the '-' is correct? So ROWER is possible.

But let's see the frequency? MOWER is more common than DOWER? And ROWER is a noun? Also common? But MOWER (lawn mower) is common.

But we can also consider that in the feedback, we have not seen any duplicate? But we haven't tested.

Another thing: in the first guess, we had E at position5? And it was misplaced? But now we have E at position4? So if the word is ROWER? E is at position4? So that's fine.

But we have to choose? We can try MOWER? Because M is more common? Or DOWER is less common? So MOWER is better.

But let's see if there is a way? We have no more guesses to test? So we must guess.

I think MOWER is a good choice? Because DOWER is less common? And ROWER has duplicate? Which might be less likely? But we don't know.

But in the absence of information, we go with MOWER.

So guess: MOWER

But we must check: M is not eliminated? Correct? So:

<guess>mower</guess>

If it's not? Then we lose? But we have to try.

But let's list all possibilities: MOWER, DOWER, ROWER? And maybe others? But I think that's it.

So we choose MOWER.### Analysis of Previous Feedback
