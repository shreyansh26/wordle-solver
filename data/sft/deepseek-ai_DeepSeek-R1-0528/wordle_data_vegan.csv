We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letters A, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know A, N, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 3, 4, 5 respectively in ""crane""), we must place them in other positions.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or R.

 Our next guess should:
 1. Include the letters A, N, E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
 2. Avoid using C and R.
 3. We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 In the first guess, we had:
   Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C, and also not R? Actually, we know R is not in the word at all, so the first letter cannot be R either.

 But note: the feedback for R was x, meaning R is not in the word at all. Similarly for C.

 We also know that A, N, E are in the word. So we have at least three letters: A, N, E.

 We need to form a 5-letter word that includes A, N, E and two new letters (avoiding C and R).

 Let's think of positions:
 In ""crane"", the A was in position 3, so in the new word we must not put A in position 3.
 Similarly, N was in position 4, so avoid position 4 for N.
 E was in position 5, so avoid position 5 for E.

 We have to place A, N, E in positions 1,2,3,4,5 but with restrictions:
   A: not in position 3
   N: not in position 4
   E: not in position 5

 Also, we don't know the other two letters. We should try to use common consonants that we haven't tried yet, such as T, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that meets these criteria.

 One idea: We can try to put A in position 1, but we don't know if that's allowed. However, we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""anode"", but note:
   - A in position 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A)
   - N in position 2 (which is not position 4, okay for N)
   - O is new
   - D is new
   - E in position 5 -> but we cannot put E in position 5 because in the first guess E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at that position. So we must avoid position 5 for E.

 Therefore, ""anode"" is invalid because E is at position 5.

 Another idea: ""anise""
   A at 1 (okay, not 3)
   N at 2 (okay, not 4)
   I at 3 (new)
   S at 4 (new)
   E at 5 -> again, position 5 for E is not allowed.

 We need to put E not at position 5. How about ""eaten""?
   E at 1 -> but we don't know if E can be at 1? The feedback only said E is in the word but not at position 5. So position 1 is allowed for E.
   A at 2 (not 3, okay)
   T at 3 (new)
   E at 4? Wait, we have two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. It could be that the word has only one E. However, we don't know.

 But note: the word ""eaten"" has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. It's possible.

 However, we must avoid using C and R. ""eaten"" doesn't have C or R.

 Let's check the positions for the known letters in ""eaten"":
   E: at position 1 and 4. We know that E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn't mean there can't be two. However, the feedback for the first guess would have shown two minuses if there were two E's? Actually, no: in the first guess we only had one E, so we only got one minus. If the word has two E's and we guess one, we only get one minus. But if we guess two E's and the word has two, then we would get two minuses (or one check and one minus, etc).

 So ""eaten"" is a possibility, but let's see if we can avoid double letters for now to get more information.

 Alternatively, how about ""plane""? 
   P, L, A, N, E.
   But note: in ""plane"", 
     A is at position 3 -> but we cannot put A at position 3 (because in the first guess A was at 3 and we got a minus, meaning it's not at 3). So that's invalid.

 How about ""panel""?
   P at 1
   A at 2 (okay, because previously A was at 3, now at 2 is different)
   N at 3 (but wait: in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because the feedback only said N is not at position 4, but it could be at 3.
   E at 4 (previously E was at 5, so position 4 is new and allowed)
   L at 5.

 Also, we are avoiding C and R.

 So ""panel"" seems like a good candidate.

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for A, N, E that we already know are wrong.

 In ""panel"":
   A: position 2 (previously was 3 -> okay)
   N: position 3 (previously was 4 -> okay, because we are changing from 4 to 3)
   E: position 4 (previously was 5 -> okay)

 And we introduce two new letters: P and L.

 So let's go with ""panel"".

 However, we must also consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

 Alternatively, we could try ""slant"", but that doesn't have E. We know E is in the word, so we must include E.

 Another word: ""snake"" -> but S at 1, N at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is not allowed (because in first guess A was at 3 and we got a minus). So invalid.

 Another: ""adobe"" -> 
   A at 1 (okay)
   D at 2 (new)
   O at 3 (new)
   B at 4 (new)
   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E was at 5 in first guess and we got minus). So invalid.

 Another: ""inane"" -> 
   I at 1
   N at 2 (okay, not 4)
   A at 3 -> not allowed (A cannot be at 3)
   N at 4 -> but we know N is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at 4? Wait, the feedback for the first guess said N was at 4 and got a minus, meaning it's not at 4. So we cannot put N at 4. Also, we have two N's? We don't know if the word has two N's.

 But in ""inane"", the first N is at position 2 (which is allowed) and the second N is at position 4 (which is not allowed). So we cannot use that.

 After considering, ""panel"" seems a good choice.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's go with ""panel"".

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess also told us that the secret word does not have C or R. So we are safe with P and L.

 So the next guess: ""panel""

 We'll see what feedback we get.

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **R** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A**, **N**, and **E** are present but misplaced (marked ""-""):
  - **A** cannot be in position 3.
  - **N** cannot be in position 4.
  - **E** cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include **A**, **N**, and **E** in new positions.
- Avoid **C** and **R** entirely.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

The word **""panel""** fits perfectly:
- **A** is in position 2 (not 3).
- **N** is in position 3 (not 4).
- **E** is in position 4 (not 5).
- New letters **P** and **L** are tested.

 Therefore, ""anode"" is invalid because E is at position 5.

 Another idea: ""anise""
   A at 1 (okay, not 3)
   N at 2 (okay, not 4)
   I at 3 (new)
   S at 4 (new)
   E at 5 -> again, position 5 for E is not allowed.

 We need to put E not at position 5. How about ""eaten""?
   E at 1 -> but we don't know if E can be at 1? The feedback only said E is in the word but not at position 5. So position 1 is allowed for E.
   A at 2 (not 3, okay)
   T at 3 (new)
   E at 4? Wait, we have two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. It could be that the word has only one E. However, we don't know.

 But note: the word ""eaten"" has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. It's possible.

 However, we must avoid using C and R. ""eaten"" doesn't have C or R.

 Let's check the positions for the known letters in ""eaten"":
   E: at position 1 and 4. We know that E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn't mean there can't be two. However, the feedback for the first guess would have shown two minuses if there were two E's? Actually, no: in the first guess we only had one E, so we only got one minus. If the word has two E's and we guess one, we only get one minus. But if we guess two E's and the word has two, then we would get two minuses (or one check and one minus, etc).

 So ""eaten"" is a possibility, but let's see if we can avoid double letters for now to get more information.

 Alternatively, how about ""plane""? 
   P, L, A, N, E.
   But note: in ""plane"", 
     A is at position 3 -> but we cannot put A at position 3 (because in the first guess A was at 3 and we got a minus, meaning it's not at 3). So that's invalid.

 How about ""panel""?
   P at 1
   A at 2 (okay, because previously A was at 3, now at 2 is different)
   N at 3 (but wait: in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because the feedback only said N is not at position 4, but it could be at 3.
   E at 4 (previously E was at 5, so position 4 is new and allowed)
   L at 5.

 Also, we are avoiding C and R.

 So ""panel"" seems like a good candidate.

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for A, N, E that we already know are wrong.

 In ""panel"":
   A: position 2 (previously was 3 -> okay)
   N: position 3 (previously was 4 -> okay, because we are changing from 4 to 3)
   E: position 4 (previously was 5 -> okay)

 And we introduce two new letters: P and L.

 So let's go with ""panel"".

 However, we must also consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

 Alternatively, we could try ""slant"", but that doesn't have E. We know E is in the word, so we must include E.

 Another word: ""snake"" -> but S at 1, N at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is not allowed (because in first guess A was at 3 and we got a minus). So invalid.

 Another: ""adobe"" -> 
   A at 1 (okay)
   D at 2 (new)
   O at 3 (new)
   B at 4 (new)
   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E was at 5 in first guess and we got minus). So invalid.

 Another: ""inane"" -> 
   I at 1
   N at 2 (okay, not 4)
   A at 3 -> not allowed (A cannot be at 3)
   N at 4 -> but we know N is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at 4? Wait, the feedback for the first guess said N was at 4 and got a minus, meaning it's not at 4. So we cannot put N at 4. Also, we have two N's? We don't know if the word has two N's.

 But in ""inane"", the first N is at position 2 (which is allowed) and the second N is at position 4 (which is not allowed). So we cannot use that.

 After considering, ""panel"" seems a good choice.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's go with ""panel"".

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess also told us that the secret word does not have C or R. So we are safe with P and L.

 So the next guess: ""panel""

 We'll see what feedback we get.

<guess>panel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **R** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A**, **N**, and **E** are present but misplaced (marked ""-""):
  - **A** cannot be in position 3.
  - **N** cannot be in position 4.
  - **E** cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include **A**, **N**, and **E** in new positions.
- Avoid **C** and **R** entirely.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

The word **""panel""** fits perfectly:
- **A** is in position 2 (not 3).
- **N** is in position 3 (not 4).
- **E** is in position 4 (not 5).
- New letters **P** and **L** are tested.
- Valid English word, no disallowed letters.

We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
  C: not in the word
  R: not in the word
  A: in the word but not in position 3
  N: in the word but not in position 4
  E: in the word but not in position 5

Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)
Meaning:
  P: not in the word
  A: in the word but not in position 2 (because in panel, A is at position 2 and we got a minus)
  N: in the word but not in position 3 (because in panel, N is at position 3 and we got a minus)
  E: in the word but not in position 4 (because in panel, E is at position 4 and we got a minus)
  L: not in the word

So now we know:
- The secret word contains A, N, E (from both guesses, confirmed by minuses).
- The secret word does not contain C, R, P, L.
- We also know the positions where A, N, E cannot be:
  A: cannot be in position 3 (from crane) and cannot be in position 2 (from panel).
  N: cannot be in position 4 (from crane) and cannot be in position 3 (from panel).
  E: cannot be in position 5 (from crane) and cannot be in position 4 (from panel).

We have three confirmed letters: A, N, E.

The secret word is 5 letters and must have two more letters that we haven't tested yet (or possibly we have tested others? We've tested C,R,P,L and they are out).

We used two guesses and have four tries left.

We need to form a word that:
  - Contains A, N, E.
  - Avoids C, R, P, L.
  - Places A not in position 2 or 3.
  - Places N not in position 3 or 4.
  - Places E not in position 4 or 5.

What positions are available for each?
  For A: can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5? (since we have eliminated 2 and 3).
  For N: can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5? (since we have eliminated 3 and 4).
  For E: can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3? (since we have eliminated 4 and 5).

But note: each of A, N, E must appear in the word exactly once? Or could there be duplicates? We don't have information about duplicates because we haven't seen any duplicates in our guesses. However, it's possible that the word has duplicate letters? But we only know at least one A, one N, one E.

We must also introduce two new letters (since we know 3 letters, but not the other two).

Let's list the possible positions for A: 1,4,5
For N: 1,2,5
For E: 1,2,3

But note: the positions must be distinct because we assume one letter per box? Actually, the word might have repeated letters? But if there were repeated letters, we don't have evidence. Also, in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate letters so far. So we'll assume each letter is unique for now.

We have to assign distinct positions to A, N, E.

Now, we need to form a word that satisfies these constraints and uses two new letters (not C,R,P,L) for the remaining positions.

Consider possible words:

First, assign positions:

Try placing A in position 1: then A at 1.
Then N can be at 2 or 5 (since 1 is taken by A, so 1 is not available for N).
Then E must be at 2,3? But if N is at 2 then E cannot be at 2? Conflict if N is at 2.

Case 1: A at 1.
  Then positions left: 2,3,4,5.
  N must be in {1,2,5} -> but 1 taken, so {2,5}. 
  E must be in {1,2,3} -> 1 taken, so {2,3}.

  So two subcases:

  Subcase 1a: N at 2.
    Then E must be at 3 (since only {2,3} but 2 taken by N).
    Then the word has A at 1, N at 2, E at 3.
    Then positions 4 and 5 must be filled with two new letters (say X and Y).
    Word so far: A N E _ _
    So ""ANE??"". We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""ANE"" and uses letters not in {C,R,P,L} and avoids duplicates? We don't know about duplicates.

    Example words: ""anode"", but O and D? But we must avoid positions? Remember, E is at 3? But we know E cannot be at position 3? No: wait, we have no feedback that E cannot be at 3? Let's see:

    For E: we only know it cannot be at 4 and 5. Position 3 is allowed.

    However, in this structure, the word is ""ANExy"", where x and y are the last two letters.

    Example words: ""anent"" -> but ""anent"" has E at 3? Yes. But note: ""anent"" has two N's? First N at 2, then another N at 4? We need to check.

    ""anent"": A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5? But we have an N at 4, but we know N cannot be in position 4? From first guess crane: N was in position 4 and we got a minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So if we put ""anent"", we are putting N at both 2 and 4? But position 4 is not allowed for N. So we cannot have an N at position 4.

    So ""anent"" is invalid because of the N at position 4.

    Another word: ""anew""? Not 5 letters.

    ""anemia""? Not 5 letters.

    ""anear"" -> but that has R, which is disallowed.

    ""anele"" -> 5 letters? Meaning: to anoint. But note: this has two E's? A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, L at 4? But L is disallowed (because in panel, L was at 5 and we got x, so L is not in the word). Also, E at 5? We cannot put E at 5? Wait: the word is ""anele"": 
      A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, L at 4 (invalid because L not allowed), E at 5 (invalid because E cannot be at 5).

    So cannot use ""anele"".

    Another: ""anise"" -> but S is acceptable? But in ""anise"": 
      A at 1, N at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is not allowed.

    ""antes"": wait, A at 1, then N? No, ""antes"" is A at 1, N at 2? N at 2? Then T at 3, E at 4? But E cannot be at position 4 -> forbidden by panel's feedback.

    In this structure (A at 1, N at 2, E at 3), we need letters for positions 4 and 5. But E at 3 is okay.

    Possible: ""anise"" fails because E must be at 3? But ""anise"" has E at 5? So we need a word that has E at 3? And then two new consonants at 4 and 5.

    What words have the pattern A N E _ _? 
      Examples: ""anent"" is invalid (double N and position 4 forbidden).
                ""anear"" has R -> invalid.
                ""anela"" -> not English.

    Not common. Maybe this placement is difficult.

  Alternatively, in subcase 1a we have A1, N2, E3 and then positions 4 and 5: we can use two new letters. But we need a word. Let me think of ""anent"" being invalid. How about ""aneze""? Not English.

  It might be hard. Let's try subcase 1b: A at 1, N at 5.

    Then E must be at 2 or 3? Since {2,3} available and E cannot be at 4 or 5? 5 taken by N, so only 2 or 3.

    So two possibilities:

      E at 2: then the word is A E ... N? Positions: 1: A, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: N.
        Word pattern: A E ? ? N
        We need a word that starts with ""AE"", which is rare? But let's see.

        Example: ""aeons"": not 5? ""aegis"" has G and S? But S is okay. 
          ""aegis"": A at 1, E at 2, G at 3, I at 4, S at 5. 
          Then we have G and I as new letters? Okay.

        But note: we must avoid C,R,P,L. Also, the letter N is at position 5? Which was forbidden? For N, we said it cannot be at 3 or 4? 5 is allowed.

        And for E at 2: allowed? We only know E cannot be at 4 or 5.

        However, in this word ""aegis"", we don't have the letter N? Wait, we need N! In this placement, we are putting N at 5? So we must use N at 5? Yes.

        So the word is A, E, then two letters, then N: ""aegis"" does not end with N. 

        How about ""aedon""? Not English.

        ""aeons"": A E O N S -> but then N is at position 4? But N cannot be at 4! Forbidden by crane.

        And also, we are putting N at 4? That is disallowed.

        If E is at 2 and N at 5, then the word must be A E X X N. Valid words: ""agent"": A G E N T -> but that's A at 1, G at 2? Wait, no: ""agent"" is A at 1, G at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5. But N at 4 is forbidden.

        ""women"": W O M E N -> not starting with A E.

        This pattern is challenging.

      Or E at 3: then the word is A ? E ? N -> pattern: A _ E _ N
        Examples: ""agent"": A G E N T -> but again, N at 4 is forbidden? Here N is at 5? ""agent"" has N at 4? Not 5.

        ""allen"" but has L -> disallowed.

        ""adren"" but R disallowed.

        ""atone"": A T O N E -> A at 1, T at 2, O at 3, N at 4? N at 4 forbidden -> invalid.

        ""aisne"" -> not English.

        ""ashen"": A S H E N -> A at 1, S at 2, H at 3, E at 4, N at 5? But E cannot be at 4 -> forbidden.

        ""axmen"": not common.

        It seems difficult to find a word with A at 1 and N at 5.

So maybe placing A at 1 is not fruitful. 

Next, place A at 4? Because A can be at 1,4,5. We tried 1. Let's try 4.

Case 2: A at 4.
  Then positions left: 1,2,3,5.
  N can be at 1,2,5 (avoiding 3,4) -> note 4 taken by A, so 1,2,5.
  E can be at 1,2,3 (avoiding 4,5) -> 4 taken, so 1,2,3.

  So we must assign N and E to different positions from {1,2,5} and {1,2,3}.

  Possible assignments:

    If we put E at 3: then N can be at 1,2,5.
      Then the word pattern: for position 4, we have A. Position 3: E.
      So the word looks like: ? ? E A ? 
      But we have N to place: at positions 1,2, or 5.

      If N at 1: then word: N ? E A ? -> ""N?EA?""
        Examples: ""steak"" but S,T,E,A,K -> E is at position 3 and A at 4? Then N at 1? So must start with N? ""N?EA?"" -> like ""nikea""? Not English. ""urea"" is 4 letters.

        ""arena"": A R E N A -> but R not allowed and also A in position 1? We have A at 4? But ""arena"" has A at 1 and 5? And we already have A at 4? So duplicate? But now position 1: A? But we are putting N at 1? No, conflict.

        Actually, we are putting N at 1. So word: N, ?, then E at 3, A at 4, and then the fifth letter. 
        Example: ""niter"": but we don't know the word? ""niter"" is N I T E R? But that doesn't have A? And R is disallowed.

        ""atnea""? Not valid.

    If N at 2: then word: ? N E A ? 
      Examples: ""oneal""? O N E A L? But L is disallowed.

      ""uneaf""? Not common.

      ""inept"": I N E P T? But P is disallowed? And we have E at 3, A at 4, so pattern: ? N E A ? -> so the first letter cannot be I? Actually, if we put in: first letter ?, then N at 2, E at 3, A at 4. Then the fifth letter.

      Possible letters: not C,R,P,L. So let's think of words ending with EA? ... Not many.

    If N at 5: then word: ? ? E A N
      Pattern: ??EAN
      Examples: ""stean""? Not English?
      ""ocean"": O C E A N -> but O is new? But C is disallowed? Yes, C is disallowed -> invalid.

      ""yeast"": Y E A S T -> but E at position 2? We need E at 3? Pattern: first two letters must be such that E is at 3? Then E at 3, A at 4, N at 5: so pattern: ??EAN.

      Words: ""swean""? Not common. ""glean"": G L E A N -> L disallowed? And we have L disallowed.

      ""quean"": Q U E A N -> Q and U? Then Q not forbidden? ""quean"" is valid? But let's see: it avoids C,R,P,L? Yes? But we haven't tested Q and U.

      Similarly, ""spean""? Not common.

      ""dearn""? D E A R N -> R disallowed.

      It might be hard.

  Alternatively, don't put E at 3? If we put E at 1: then word: E at 1, then positions 2 and 3 available for the letters? And then A at 4.

    Then N must be at 1,2,5? But 1 taken by E, so N at 2 or 5.

    So if N at 2: word: E, N, ?, A, ? -> pattern: EN?A?
      Examples: ""entry"": E N T R Y -> R disallowed? Also, R is disallowed.

      ""endow"": E N D O W -> O and W acceptable? But we don't have A? Where is A? We must have A at 4? So the word must be ""ENsomethingA..."" -> but that's ""EN?A?"" meaning fourth letter A? So ""E N ? A ?"".

      ""entia"" is a word? E N T I A -> that is E at 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4, A at 5? But we want A at 4? So that doesn't match.

      We need the fourth letter to be A? So ""entia"" has A at 5.

      How about ""envoy""? No A.

      We need A at position 4? Not at 5.

      ""entra"": but has R.

    Or if N at 5: then word: E ? ? A N -> pattern: E??AN
      Examples: ""again""? A G A I N -> but A at 1? And we have E? Conflict? The word must start with E.

      ""eatan""? Not English.

      ""beman""? Not English.

      But we have to fill with two letters. Example: ""eolian"": too long.

      ""expan"": not word.

So perhaps putting A at 4 is hard too.

Now, place A at 5? Last position.

Case 3: A at 5.
  Then positions left: 1,2,3,4.
  N must be at 1,2,5? But 5 taken, so at 1 or 2? (avoiding 3,4).
  E must be at 1,2,3? (avoiding 4,5).

  And A at 5.

  So assign N and E.

  Possibilities:

    N at 1: then word: N _ _ _ A
        And E must be at 1,2,3? 1 taken, so 2 or 3.
        If E at 2: word: N E ? ? A -> pattern: NE?..A.
        If E at 3: word: N ? E ? A -> pattern: N?E?A.

    N at 2: then word: _ N _ _ A.
        E at 1 or 3? 

Let's try N at 1 and E at 2: then word: N E ? ? A -> ""NE??A""
  Examples: ""never"" -> N E V E R? But R disallowed and also E at position 2 and 4? The second E? Also, the pattern requires last letter A? Not R.

  ""needs"": N E E D S? Last letter S, not A.

  ""neria"": not common.

  ""necza"": not word.

Not easy.

Try N at 1 and E at 3: then word: N ? E ? A -> ""N?E?A""
  Examples: ""noema""? Note O E M A -> but at positions: N at 1, O at 2, E at 3, M at 4, A at 5? E at 3 is allowed.

  And M is a new letter? So ""noema"" might be a word? It's valid? Yes, meaning a thought or concept.

  But does it meet all:
    - Contains A, N, E.
    - Avoids C,R,P,L? O, E, M: yes.
    - Positions:
        A at 5 -> this is the first time A is at 5? We know from crane: A cannot be at 3 -> 5 is allowed. And in this guess, A is at 5 -> allowed? Yes, because we only have restrictions from the minuses: A cannot be at 2 or 3? 5 is okay.
        N at 1 -> allowed? We only know N cannot be at 3 or 4? 1 is okay.
        E at 3 -> allowed (E only cannot be at 4 or 5? 3 is okay).

  Then the letters: O (new) and M (new) are used.

  But we have to make sure that the word ""noema"" doesn't have any disallowed letter? It has O,E,M,A,N: all allowed? Avoid C,R,P,L.

  So ""noema"" is a possibility.

Another example: ""nisei""? S and I? But S and I are new? But then we don't have E? No, it's N at1, I at2, S at3, E? wait no, we require E at3. ""nisei"": N I S E I -> then E is at 4? We need E at position 3? So no.

""noted"": N O T E D -> E is at 4? But E cannot be at 4 -> forbidden.

""named"": N A M E D -> A at 2? Not allowed? A must be at 5? Here A is at 2? Forbidden by previous feedback.

""naveo""? Not English.

""nema"" too short?

""noema"" seems a good candidate.

But is it English? I think noema is an English word? Or a valid variant?

To ensure commonality, try a more common word.

How about ""cause""? But C disallowed.

Another: ""movie""? M O V I E -> doesn't start with N.

Back to N at 2? If we don't use N at 1, we can do:

  If N at 2: then word: ? N ? ? A
  And E must be at 1 or 2 or 3? But 2 taken by N, so 1 or 3.

  So two subcases:

      E at 1: then word: E N ? ? A -> pattern: EN??A

      E at 3: then word: ? N E ? A -> pattern: ?N E?A

  For pattern EN??A: words: ""enter"": not ending with A.
            ""envya"": ENVYA? V,Y,A? but last letter Y? Wait: ""envya"": E,N,V,Y,A -> positions: E at1, N at2, V at3, Y at4, A at5? Yes.

            But we don't have restrictions on V and Y? And we haven't used them? They are new.

            So ""envya"" is a word? I think it might not be standard.

            ""enough"" -> not ending with A.

            ""enema"": E N E M A -> but this has E at 1 and 3? But our pattern has the fifth letter A? Yes: positions: E at1, N at2, E at3, M at4, A at5. But we have two E's? And the feedback so far has only shown distinct versions? It is word.

            Check the positions for existing letters:
              A: at 5 -> allowed? We only forbidden positions 2 and 3 -> allowed.
              N: at 2 -> allowed? We only forbidden positions 3 and 4 -> allowed.
              E: at 1 and 3 -> 
                 E cannot be at 4 or 5? 1 and 3 are allowed? Yes.

            And avoid P,L,R,C: yes.

            So ""enema"" is a valid word: letters E, N, E, M, A.

            We may get an issue with the feedback? Because we have two E's? But that's okay.

  Let's compare with ""noema"". Also, ""enema"" is commonly known.

But in ""enema"", E is at position 1 and 3. And for the letter E, we know it is in the word, but the secret word might have two E's? It's possible.

However, we used ""crane"" and ""panel"", both had one E? So we had minuses for E? But if we guess ""enema"", we might get:

  If the secret word has only one E? Then one of the E's would be marked as not in the word? But we know that the word has at least one E. We don't know whether two E's? However, our feedback and deductions do not rule out two E's.

So let's consider ""enema"" as an option.

But compare with ""noema"": ""noema"" has been recognized as part of the English language? Let's prefer common words.

""enema"" is more common than ""noema"".

But are there other common words? 

Perhaps ""inane""? But we considered earlier and it had problems. Let me recall: ""inane"" is I N A N E -> but A cannot be at position 3? Because crane had A at 3 minus. And in ""inane"", A is at 3? So invalid.

Alternative: ""usage""? But U,S,A,G,E? But A is at 3? not allowed. And we have to include A and E and N? ""usage"" has A,E,N? Actually, ""usage"": U S A G E -> 
  A is at position 3? -> not allowed? And also we don't have N? So invalid.

Another: ""stage""? S T A G E -> A at 3? not allowed.

""agent"": we considered -> N at 4? not allowed.

Given our constraints, we have two candidates: ""noema"" and ""enema"". ""enema"" is a more common word.

So let's propose ""enema"".

But note: we haven't tested for duplicate E? But the feedback will tell us.

Alternatively, we can choose a word with only one E? But we know that we must have at least one E. And we are forced to put E at an allowed position.

Another word: ""taken"": T A K E N -> A at position 2? Not allowed? From panel feedback: A cannot be at 2 -> forbidden. And N is at 5? But T is new? Also, A at2: disallowed.

""baned"": B A N E D -> A at2: disallowed.

 So we go with ""enema"".

However, let's double-check the feedback for ""enema"":
  The secret word contains A, N, E? Yes.
  The positions: 
    E at1: we don't know if that is correct? But we are guessing.
    N at2: okay
    E at3: okay
    M at4: first time testing M
    A at5: okay? But crane also had minuses for A and E? So crane had A at position 3: that is why A cannot be there? Now we are putting A at5: that is different.

So we'll guess ""enema"".

If we do ""enema"", we are using two E's? Not forbidden.

But we have another option: we could try a word with only one E? For example, we haven't tried assigning A at 4 again? Or other possibilities.

But we are limited by time and common words.

After consideration, I choose ""enema"" because it meets all the constraints and is a valid English word.

So next guess: enema

Let's hope it works.

But note: we also haven't tested many new letters. We are testing E again? But in new positions? Also new letters M and not others.

But it's okay.

Alternatively, if we want to use all five positions effectively, we can try to avoid duplication? But it's not necessary.

Let's go.

<guess>enema</guess>
</think>
After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:

- **Crane**: C (x), R (x), A (-), N (-), E (-)  
  → A, N, and E are present but misplaced; C and R are absent.
- **Panel**: P (x), A (-), N (-), E (-), L (x)  
  → A, N, and E remain misplaced; P and L are absent.

### Key insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**: A, N, E are in the secret word.
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, P, L are excluded.
3. **Position constraints**:
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
   - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
   - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
4. Only positions 1, 4, and 5 are possible for A; positions 1, 2, and 5 for N; and positions 1, 2, and 3 for E.

Given these constraints and the goal to test new letters while including A, N, E, the word **""enema""** fits:
- Positions: E (1), N (2), E (3), M (4), A (5)  
  - A at position 5 (allowed).
  - N at position 2 (allowed).
  - E at positions 1 and 3 (allowed positions; may indicate duplicated E).
- New letters tested: M.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, P, L).

<guess>enema</guess>",enema,"We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
  C: not in the word
  R: not in the word
  A: in the word but not in position 3
  N: in the word but not in position 4
  E: in the word but not in position 5

Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)
Meaning:
  P: not in the word
  A: in the word but not in position 2 (because in panel, A is at position 2 and we got a minus)
  N: in the word but not in position 3 (because in panel, N is at position 3 and we got a minus)
  E: in the word but not in position 4 (because in panel, E is at position 4 and we got a minus)
  L: not in the word

So now we know:
- The secret word contains A, N, E (from both guesses, confirmed by minuses).
- The secret word does not contain C, R, P, L.
- We also know the positions where A, N, E cannot be:
  A: cannot be in position 3 (from crane) and cannot be in position 2 (from panel).
  N: cannot be in position 4 (from crane) and cannot be in position 3 (from panel).
  E: cannot be in position 5 (from crane) and cannot be in position 4 (from panel).

We have three confirmed letters: A, N, E.

The secret word is 5 letters and must have two more letters that we haven't tested yet (or possibly we have tested others? We've tested C,R,P,L and they are out).

We used two guesses and have four tries left.

We need to form a word that:
  - Contains A, N, E.
  - Avoids C, R, P, L.
  - Places A not in position 2 or 3.
  - Places N not in position 3 or 4.
  - Places E not in position 4 or 5.

What positions are available for each?
  For A: can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5? (since we have eliminated 2 and 3).
  For N: can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5? (since we have eliminated 3 and 4).
  For E: can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3? (since we have eliminated 4 and 5).

But note: each of A, N, E must appear in the word exactly once? Or could there be duplicates? We don't have information about duplicates because we haven't seen any duplicates in our guesses. However, it's possible that the word has duplicate letters? But we only know at least one A, one N, one E.

We must also introduce two new letters (since we know 3 letters, but not the other two).

Let's list the possible positions for A: 1,4,5
For N: 1,2,5
For E: 1,2,3

But note: the positions must be distinct because we assume one letter per box? Actually, the word might have repeated letters? But if there were repeated letters, we don't have evidence. Also, in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate letters so far. So we'll assume each letter is unique for now.

We have to assign distinct positions to A, N, E.

Now, we need to form a word that satisfies these constraints and uses two new letters (not C,R,P,L) for the remaining positions.

Consider possible words:

First, assign positions:

Try placing A in position 1: then A at 1.
Then N can be at 2 or 5 (since 1 is taken by A, so 1 is not available for N).
Then E must be at 2,3? But if N is at 2 then E cannot be at 2? Conflict if N is at 2.

Case 1: A at 1.
  Then positions left: 2,3,4,5.
  N must be in {1,2,5} -> but 1 taken, so {2,5}. 
  E must be in {1,2,3} -> 1 taken, so {2,3}.

  So two subcases:

  Subcase 1a: N at 2.
    Then E must be at 3 (since only {2,3} but 2 taken by N).
    Then the word has A at 1, N at 2, E at 3.
    Then positions 4 and 5 must be filled with two new letters (say X and Y).
    Word so far: A N E _ _
    So ""ANE??"". We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""ANE"" and uses letters not in {C,R,P,L} and avoids duplicates? We don't know about duplicates.

    Example words: ""anode"", but O and D? But we must avoid positions? Remember, E is at 3? But we know E cannot be at position 3? No: wait, we have no feedback that E cannot be at 3? Let's see:

    For E: we only know it cannot be at 4 and 5. Position 3 is allowed.

    However, in this structure, the word is ""ANExy"", where x and y are the last two letters.

    Example words: ""anent"" -> but ""anent"" has E at 3? Yes. But note: ""anent"" has two N's? First N at 2, then another N at 4? We need to check.

    ""anent"": A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5? But we have an N at 4, but we know N cannot be in position 4? From first guess crane: N was in position 4 and we got a minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So if we put ""anent"", we are putting N at both 2 and 4? But position 4 is not allowed for N. So we cannot have an N at position 4.

    So ""anent"" is invalid because of the N at position 4.

    Another word: ""anew""? Not 5 letters.

    ""anemia""? Not 5 letters.

    ""anear"" -> but that has R, which is disallowed.

    ""anele"" -> 5 letters? Meaning: to anoint. But note: this has two E's? A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, L at 4? But L is disallowed (because in panel, L was at 5 and we got x, so L is not in the word). Also, E at 5? We cannot put E at 5? Wait: the word is ""anele"": 
      A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, L at 4 (invalid because L not allowed), E at 5 (invalid because E cannot be at 5).

    So cannot use ""anele"".

    Another: ""anise"" -> but S is acceptable? But in ""anise"": 
      A at 1, N at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is not allowed.

    ""antes"": wait, A at 1, then N? No, ""antes"" is A at 1, N at 2? N at 2? Then T at 3, E at 4? But E cannot be at position 4 -> forbidden by panel's feedback.

    In this structure (A at 1, N at 2, E at 3), we need letters for positions 4 and 5. But E at 3 is okay.

    Possible: ""anise"" fails because E must be at 3? But ""anise"" has E at 5? So we need a word that has E at 3? And then two new consonants at 4 and 5.

    What words have the pattern A N E _ _? 
      Examples: ""anent"" is invalid (double N and position 4 forbidden).
                ""anear"" has R -> invalid.
                ""anela"" -> not English.

    Not common. Maybe this placement is difficult.

  Alternatively, in subcase 1a we have A1, N2, E3 and then positions 4 and 5: we can use two new letters. But we need a word. Let me think of ""anent"" being invalid. How about ""aneze""? Not English.

  It might be hard. Let's try subcase 1b: A at 1, N at 5.

    Then E must be at 2 or 3? Since {2,3} available and E cannot be at 4 or 5? 5 taken by N, so only 2 or 3.

    So two possibilities:

      E at 2: then the word is A E ... N? Positions: 1: A, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: N.
        Word pattern: A E ? ? N
        We need a word that starts with ""AE"", which is rare? But let's see.

        Example: ""aeons"": not 5? ""aegis"" has G and S? But S is okay. 
          ""aegis"": A at 1, E at 2, G at 3, I at 4, S at 5. 
          Then we have G and I as new letters? Okay.

        But note: we must avoid C,R,P,L. Also, the letter N is at position 5? Which was forbidden? For N, we said it cannot be at 3 or 4? 5 is allowed.

        And for E at 2: allowed? We only know E cannot be at 4 or 5.

        However, in this word ""aegis"", we don't have the letter N? Wait, we need N! In this placement, we are putting N at 5? So we must use N at 5? Yes.

        So the word is A, E, then two letters, then N: ""aegis"" does not end with N. 

        How about ""aedon""? Not English.

        ""aeons"": A E O N S -> but then N is at position 4? But N cannot be at 4! Forbidden by crane.

        And also, we are putting N at 4? That is disallowed.

        If E is at 2 and N at 5, then the word must be A E X X N. Valid words: ""agent"": A G E N T -> but that's A at 1, G at 2? Wait, no: ""agent"" is A at 1, G at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5. But N at 4 is forbidden.

        ""women"": W O M E N -> not starting with A E.

        This pattern is challenging.

      Or E at 3: then the word is A ? E ? N -> pattern: A _ E _ N
        Examples: ""agent"": A G E N T -> but again, N at 4 is forbidden? Here N is at 5? ""agent"" has N at 4? Not 5.

        ""allen"" but has L -> disallowed.

        ""adren"" but R disallowed.

        ""atone"": A T O N E -> A at 1, T at 2, O at 3, N at 4? N at 4 forbidden -> invalid.

        ""aisne"" -> not English.

        ""ashen"": A S H E N -> A at 1, S at 2, H at 3, E at 4, N at 5? But E cannot be at 4 -> forbidden.

        ""axmen"": not common.

        It seems difficult to find a word with A at 1 and N at 5.

So maybe placing A at 1 is not fruitful. 

Next, place A at 4? Because A can be at 1,4,5. We tried 1. Let's try 4.

Case 2: A at 4.
  Then positions left: 1,2,3,5.
  N can be at 1,2,5 (avoiding 3,4) -> note 4 taken by A, so 1,2,5.
  E can be at 1,2,3 (avoiding 4,5) -> 4 taken, so 1,2,3.

  So we must assign N and E to different positions from {1,2,5} and {1,2,3}.

  Possible assignments:

    If we put E at 3: then N can be at 1,2,5.
      Then the word pattern: for position 4, we have A. Position 3: E.
      So the word looks like: ? ? E A ? 
      But we have N to place: at positions 1,2, or 5.

      If N at 1: then word: N ? E A ? -> ""N?EA?""
        Examples: ""steak"" but S,T,E,A,K -> E is at position 3 and A at 4? Then N at 1? So must start with N? ""N?EA?"" -> like ""nikea""? Not English. ""urea"" is 4 letters.

        ""arena"": A R E N A -> but R not allowed and also A in position 1? We have A at 4? But ""arena"" has A at 1 and 5? And we already have A at 4? So duplicate? But now position 1: A? But we are putting N at 1? No, conflict.

        Actually, we are putting N at 1. So word: N, ?, then E at 3, A at 4, and then the fifth letter. 
        Example: ""niter"": but we don't know the word? ""niter"" is N I T E R? But that doesn't have A? And R is disallowed.

        ""atnea""? Not valid.

    If N at 2: then word: ? N E A ? 
      Examples: ""oneal""? O N E A L? But L is disallowed.

      ""uneaf""? Not common.

      ""inept"": I N E P T? But P is disallowed? And we have E at 3, A at 4, so pattern: ? N E A ? -> so the first letter cannot be I? Actually, if we put in: first letter ?, then N at 2, E at 3, A at 4. Then the fifth letter.

      Possible letters: not C,R,P,L. So let's think of words ending with EA? ... Not many.

    If N at 5: then word: ? ? E A N
      Pattern: ??EAN
      Examples: ""stean""? Not English?
      ""ocean"": O C E A N -> but O is new? But C is disallowed? Yes, C is disallowed -> invalid.

      ""yeast"": Y E A S T -> but E at position 2? We need E at 3? Pattern: first two letters must be such that E is at 3? Then E at 3, A at 4, N at 5: so pattern: ??EAN.

      Words: ""swean""? Not common. ""glean"": G L E A N -> L disallowed? And we have L disallowed.

      ""quean"": Q U E A N -> Q and U? Then Q not forbidden? ""quean"" is valid? But let's see: it avoids C,R,P,L? Yes? But we haven't tested Q and U.

      Similarly, ""spean""? Not common.

      ""dearn""? D E A R N -> R disallowed.

      It might be hard.

  Alternatively, don't put E at 3? If we put E at 1: then word: E at 1, then positions 2 and 3 available for the letters? And then A at 4.

    Then N must be at 1,2,5? But 1 taken by E, so N at 2 or 5.

    So if N at 2: word: E, N, ?, A, ? -> pattern: EN?A?
      Examples: ""entry"": E N T R Y -> R disallowed? Also, R is disallowed.

      ""endow"": E N D O W -> O and W acceptable? But we don't have A? Where is A? We must have A at 4? So the word must be ""ENsomethingA..."" -> but that's ""EN?A?"" meaning fourth letter A? So ""E N ? A ?"".

      ""entia"" is a word? E N T I A -> that is E at 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4, A at 5? But we want A at 4? So that doesn't match.

      We need the fourth letter to be A? So ""entia"" has A at 5.

      How about ""envoy""? No A.

      We need A at position 4? Not at 5.

      ""entra"": but has R.

    Or if N at 5: then word: E ? ? A N -> pattern: E??AN
      Examples: ""again""? A G A I N -> but A at 1? And we have E? Conflict? The word must start with E.

      ""eatan""? Not English.

      ""beman""? Not English.

      But we have to fill with two letters. Example: ""eolian"": too long.

      ""expan"": not word.

So perhaps putting A at 4 is hard too.

Now, place A at 5? Last position.

Case 3: A at 5.
  Then positions left: 1,2,3,4.
  N must be at 1,2,5? But 5 taken, so at 1 or 2? (avoiding 3,4).
  E must be at 1,2,3? (avoiding 4,5).

  And A at 5.

  So assign N and E.

  Possibilities:

    N at 1: then word: N _ _ _ A
        And E must be at 1,2,3? 1 taken, so 2 or 3.
        If E at 2: word: N E ? ? A -> pattern: NE?..A.
        If E at 3: word: N ? E ? A -> pattern: N?E?A.

    N at 2: then word: _ N _ _ A.
        E at 1 or 3? 

Let's try N at 1 and E at 2: then word: N E ? ? A -> ""NE??A""
  Examples: ""never"" -> N E V E R? But R disallowed and also E at position 2 and 4? The second E? Also, the pattern requires last letter A? Not R.

  ""needs"": N E E D S? Last letter S, not A.

  ""neria"": not common.

  ""necza"": not word.

Not easy.

Try N at 1 and E at 3: then word: N ? E ? A -> ""N?E?A""
  Examples: ""noema""? Note O E M A -> but at positions: N at 1, O at 2, E at 3, M at 4, A at 5? E at 3 is allowed.

  And M is a new letter? So ""noema"" might be a word? It's valid? Yes, meaning a thought or concept.

  But does it meet all:
    - Contains A, N, E.
    - Avoids C,R,P,L? O, E, M: yes.
    - Positions:
        A at 5 -> this is the first time A is at 5? We know from crane: A cannot be at 3 -> 5 is allowed. And in this guess, A is at 5 -> allowed? Yes, because we only have restrictions from the minuses: A cannot be at 2 or 3? 5 is okay.
        N at 1 -> allowed? We only know N cannot be at 3 or 4? 1 is okay.
        E at 3 -> allowed (E only cannot be at 4 or 5? 3 is okay).

  Then the letters: O (new) and M (new) are used.

  But we have to make sure that the word ""noema"" doesn't have any disallowed letter? It has O,E,M,A,N: all allowed? Avoid C,R,P,L.

  So ""noema"" is a possibility.

Another example: ""nisei""? S and I? But S and I are new? But then we don't have E? No, it's N at1, I at2, S at3, E? wait no, we require E at3. ""nisei"": N I S E I -> then E is at 4? We need E at position 3? So no.

""noted"": N O T E D -> E is at 4? But E cannot be at 4 -> forbidden.

""named"": N A M E D -> A at 2? Not allowed? A must be at 5? Here A is at 2? Forbidden by previous feedback.

""naveo""? Not English.

""nema"" too short?

""noema"" seems a good candidate.

But is it English? I think noema is an English word? Or a valid variant?

To ensure commonality, try a more common word.

How about ""cause""? But C disallowed.

Another: ""movie""? M O V I E -> doesn't start with N.

Back to N at 2? If we don't use N at 1, we can do:

  If N at 2: then word: ? N ? ? A
  And E must be at 1 or 2 or 3? But 2 taken by N, so 1 or 3.

  So two subcases:

      E at 1: then word: E N ? ? A -> pattern: EN??A

      E at 3: then word: ? N E ? A -> pattern: ?N E?A

  For pattern EN??A: words: ""enter"": not ending with A.
            ""envya"": ENVYA? V,Y,A? but last letter Y? Wait: ""envya"": E,N,V,Y,A -> positions: E at1, N at2, V at3, Y at4, A at5? Yes.

            But we don't have restrictions on V and Y? And we haven't used them? They are new.

            So ""envya"" is a word? I think it might not be standard.

            ""enough"" -> not ending with A.

            ""enema"": E N E M A -> but this has E at 1 and 3? But our pattern has the fifth letter A? Yes: positions: E at1, N at2, E at3, M at4, A at5. But we have two E's? And the feedback so far has only shown distinct versions? It is word.

            Check the positions for existing letters:
              A: at 5 -> allowed? We only forbidden positions 2 and 3 -> allowed.
              N: at 2 -> allowed? We only forbidden positions 3 and 4 -> allowed.
              E: at 1 and 3 -> 
                 E cannot be at 4 or 5? 1 and 3 are allowed? Yes.

            And avoid P,L,R,C: yes.

            So ""enema"" is a valid word: letters E, N, E, M, A.

            We may get an issue with the feedback? Because we have two E's? But that's okay.

  Let's compare with ""noema"". Also, ""enema"" is commonly known.

But in ""enema"", E is at position 1 and 3. And for the letter E, we know it is in the word, but the secret word might have two E's? It's possible.

However, we used ""crane"" and ""panel"", both had one E? So we had minuses for E? But if we guess ""enema"", we might get:

  If the secret word has only one E? Then one of the E's would be marked as not in the word? But we know that the word has at least one E. We don't know whether two E's? However, our feedback and deductions do not rule out two E's.

So let's consider ""enema"" as an option.

But compare with ""noema"": ""noema"" has been recognized as part of the English language? Let's prefer common words.

""enema"" is more common than ""noema"".

But are there other common words? 

Perhaps ""inane""? But we considered earlier and it had problems. Let me recall: ""inane"" is I N A N E -> but A cannot be at position 3? Because crane had A at 3 minus. And in ""inane"", A is at 3? So invalid.

Alternative: ""usage""? But U,S,A,G,E? But A is at 3? not allowed. And we have to include A and E and N? ""usage"" has A,E,N? Actually, ""usage"": U S A G E -> 
  A is at position 3? -> not allowed? And also we don't have N? So invalid.

Another: ""stage""? S T A G E -> A at 3? not allowed.

""agent"": we considered -> N at 4? not allowed.

Given our constraints, we have two candidates: ""noema"" and ""enema"". ""enema"" is a more common word.

So let's propose ""enema"".

But note: we haven't tested for duplicate E? But the feedback will tell us.

Alternatively, we can choose a word with only one E? But we know that we must have at least one E. And we are forced to put E at an allowed position.

Another word: ""taken"": T A K E N -> A at position 2? Not allowed? From panel feedback: A cannot be at 2 -> forbidden. And N is at 5? But T is new? Also, A at2: disallowed.

""baned"": B A N E D -> A at2: disallowed.

 So we go with ""enema"".

However, let's double-check the feedback for ""enema"":
  The secret word contains A, N, E? Yes.
  The positions: 
    E at1: we don't know if that is correct? But we are guessing.
    N at2: okay
    E at3: okay
    M at4: first time testing M
    A at5: okay? But crane also had minuses for A and E? So crane had A at position 3: that is why A cannot be there? Now we are putting A at5: that is different.

So we'll guess ""enema"".

If we do ""enema"", we are using two E's? Not forbidden.

But we have another option: we could try a word with only one E? For example, we haven't tried assigning A at 4 again? Or other possibilities.

But we are limited by time and common words.

After consideration, I choose ""enema"" because it meets all the constraints and is a valid English word.

So next guess: enema

Let's hope it works.

But note: we also haven't tested many new letters. We are testing E again? But in new positions? Also new letters M and not others.

But it's okay.

Alternatively, if we want to use all five positions effectively, we can try to avoid duplication? But it's not necessary.

Let's go.

<guess>enema</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:

- **Crane**: C (x), R (x), A (-), N (-), E (-)  
  → A, N, and E are present but misplaced; C and R are absent.
- **Panel**: P (x), A (-), N (-), E (-), L (x)  
  → A, N, and E remain misplaced; P and L are absent.

### Key insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**: A, N, E are in the secret word.
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, P, L are excluded.
3. **Position constraints**:
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
   - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
   - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
4. Only positions 1, 4, and 5 are possible for A; positions 1, 2, and 5 for N; and positions 1, 2, and 3 for E.

Given these constraints and the goal to test new letters while including A, N, E, the word **""enema""** fits:
- Positions: E (1), N (2), E (3), M (4), A (5)  
  - A at position 5 (allowed).
  - N at position 2 (allowed).
  - E at positions 1 and 3 (allowed positions; may indicate duplicated E).
- New letters tested: M.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, P, L).",Guess 3: enema -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) E(-) M(x) A(-),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,vegan,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letters A, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know A, N, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 3, 4, 5 respectively in ""crane""), we must place them in other positions.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or R.

 Our next guess should:
 1. Include the letters A, N, E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
 2. Avoid using C and R.
 3. We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 In the first guess, we had:
   Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C, and also not R? Actually, we know R is not in the word at all, so the first letter cannot be R either.

 But note: the feedback for R was x, meaning R is not in the word at all. Similarly for C.

 We also know that A, N, E are in the word. So we have at least three letters: A, N, E.

 We need to form a 5-letter word that includes A, N, E and two new letters (avoiding C and R).

 Let's think of positions:
 In ""crane"", the A was in position 3, so in the new word we must not put A in position 3.
 Similarly, N was in position 4, so avoid position 4 for N.
 E was in position 5, so avoid position 5 for E.

 We have to place A, N, E in positions 1,2,3,4,5 but with restrictions:
   A: not in position 3
   N: not in position 4
   E: not in position 5

 Also, we don't know the other two letters. We should try to use common consonants that we haven't tried yet, such as T, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that meets these criteria.

 One idea: We can try to put A in position 1, but we don't know if that's allowed. However, we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""anode"", but note:
   - A in position 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A)
   - N in position 2 (which is not position 4, okay for N)
   - O is new
   - D is new
   - E in position 5 -> but we cannot put E in position 5 because in the first guess E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at that position. So we must avoid position 5 for E.

 Therefore, ""anode"" is invalid because E is at position 5.

 Another idea: ""anise""
   A at 1 (okay, not 3)
   N at 2 (okay, not 4)
   I at 3 (new)
   S at 4 (new)
   E at 5 -> again, position 5 for E is not allowed.

 We need to put E not at position 5. How about ""eaten""?
   E at 1 -> but we don't know if E can be at 1? The feedback only said E is in the word but not at position 5. So position 1 is allowed for E.
   A at 2 (not 3, okay)
   T at 3 (new)
   E at 4? Wait, we have two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. It could be that the word has only one E. However, we don't know.

 But note: the word ""eaten"" has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. It's possible.

 However, we must avoid using C and R. ""eaten"" doesn't have C or R.

 Let's check the positions for the known letters in ""eaten"":
   E: at position 1 and 4. We know that E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn't mean there can't be two. However, the feedback for the first guess would have shown two minuses if there were two E's? Actually, no: in the first guess we only had one E, so we only got one minus. If the word has two E's and we guess one, we only get one minus. But if we guess two E's and the word has two, then we would get two minuses (or one check and one minus, etc).

 So ""eaten"" is a possibility, but let's see if we can avoid double letters for now to get more information.

 Alternatively, how about ""plane""? 
   P, L, A, N, E.
   But note: in ""plane"", 
     A is at position 3 -> but we cannot put A at position 3 (because in the first guess A was at 3 and we got a minus, meaning it's not at 3). So that's invalid.

 How about ""panel""?
   P at 1
   A at 2 (okay, because previously A was at 3, now at 2 is different)
   N at 3 (but wait: in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because the feedback only said N is not at position 4, but it could be at 3.
   E at 4 (previously E was at 5, so position 4 is new and allowed)
   L at 5.

 Also, we are avoiding C and R.

 So ""panel"" seems like a good candidate.

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for A, N, E that we already know are wrong.

 In ""panel"":
   A: position 2 (previously was 3 -> okay)
   N: position 3 (previously was 4 -> okay, because we are changing from 4 to 3)
   E: position 4 (previously was 5 -> okay)

 And we introduce two new letters: P and L.

 So let's go with ""panel"".

 However, we must also consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

 Alternatively, we could try ""slant"", but that doesn't have E. We know E is in the word, so we must include E.

 Another word: ""snake"" -> but S at 1, N at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is not allowed (because in first guess A was at 3 and we got a minus). So invalid.

 Another: ""adobe"" -> 
   A at 1 (okay)
   D at 2 (new)
   O at 3 (new)
   B at 4 (new)
   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E was at 5 in first guess and we got minus). So invalid.

 Another: ""inane"" -> 
   I at 1
   N at 2 (okay, not 4)
   A at 3 -> not allowed (A cannot be at 3)
   N at 4 -> but we know N is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at 4? Wait, the feedback for the first guess said N was at 4 and got a minus, meaning it's not at 4. So we cannot put N at 4. Also, we have two N's? We don't know if the word has two N's.

 But in ""inane"", the first N is at position 2 (which is allowed) and the second N is at position 4 (which is not allowed). So we cannot use that.

 After considering, ""panel"" seems a good choice.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's go with ""panel"".

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess also told us that the secret word does not have C or R. So we are safe with P and L.

 So the next guess: ""panel""

 We'll see what feedback we get.

<guess>panel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **R** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A**, **N**, and **E** are present but misplaced (marked ""-""):
  - **A** cannot be in position 3.
  - **N** cannot be in position 4.
  - **E** cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include **A**, **N**, and **E** in new positions.
- Avoid **C** and **R** entirely.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

The word **""panel""** fits perfectly:
- **A** is in position 2 (not 3).
- **N** is in position 3 (not 4).
- **E** is in position 4 (not 5).
- New letters **P** and **L** are tested.
- Valid English word, no disallowed letters.

<guess>panel</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
  C: not in the word
  R: not in the word
  A: in the word but not in position 3
  N: in the word but not in position 4
  E: in the word but not in position 5

Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)
Meaning:
  P: not in the word
  A: in the word but not in position 2 (because in panel, A is at position 2 and we got a minus)
  N: in the word but not in position 3 (because in panel, N is at position 3 and we got a minus)
  E: in the word but not in position 4 (because in panel, E is at position 4 and we got a minus)
  L: not in the word

So now we know:
- The secret word contains A, N, E (from both guesses, confirmed by minuses).
- The secret word does not contain C, R, P, L.
- We also know the positions where A, N, E cannot be:
  A: cannot be in position 3 (from crane) and cannot be in position 2 (from panel).
  N: cannot be in position 4 (from crane) and cannot be in position 3 (from panel).
  E: cannot be in position 5 (from crane) and cannot be in position 4 (from panel).

We have three confirmed letters: A, N, E.

The secret word is 5 letters and must have two more letters that we haven't tested yet (or possibly we have tested others? We've tested C,R,P,L and they are out).

We used two guesses and have four tries left.

We need to form a word that:
  - Contains A, N, E.
  - Avoids C, R, P, L.
  - Places A not in position 2 or 3.
  - Places N not in position 3 or 4.
  - Places E not in position 4 or 5.

What positions are available for each?
  For A: can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5? (since we have eliminated 2 and 3).
  For N: can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5? (since we have eliminated 3 and 4).
  For E: can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3? (since we have eliminated 4 and 5).

But note: each of A, N, E must appear in the word exactly once? Or could there be duplicates? We don't have information about duplicates because we haven't seen any duplicates in our guesses. However, it's possible that the word has duplicate letters? But we only know at least one A, one N, one E.

We must also introduce two new letters (since we know 3 letters, but not the other two).

Let's list the possible positions for A: 1,4,5
For N: 1,2,5
For E: 1,2,3

But note: the positions must be distinct because we assume one letter per box? Actually, the word might have repeated letters? But if there were repeated letters, we don't have evidence. Also, in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate letters so far. So we'll assume each letter is unique for now.

We have to assign distinct positions to A, N, E.

Now, we need to form a word that satisfies these constraints and uses two new letters (not C,R,P,L) for the remaining positions.

Consider possible words:

First, assign positions:

Try placing A in position 1: then A at 1.
Then N can be at 2 or 5 (since 1 is taken by A, so 1 is not available for N).
Then E must be at 2,3? But if N is at 2 then E cannot be at 2? Conflict if N is at 2.

Case 1: A at 1.
  Then positions left: 2,3,4,5.
  N must be in {1,2,5} -> but 1 taken, so {2,5}. 
  E must be in {1,2,3} -> 1 taken, so {2,3}.

  So two subcases:

  Subcase 1a: N at 2.
    Then E must be at 3 (since only {2,3} but 2 taken by N).
    Then the word has A at 1, N at 2, E at 3.
    Then positions 4 and 5 must be filled with two new letters (say X and Y).
    Word so far: A N E _ _
    So ""ANE??"". We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""ANE"" and uses letters not in {C,R,P,L} and avoids duplicates? We don't know about duplicates.

    Example words: ""anode"", but O and D? But we must avoid positions? Remember, E is at 3? But we know E cannot be at position 3? No: wait, we have no feedback that E cannot be at 3? Let's see:

    For E: we only know it cannot be at 4 and 5. Position 3 is allowed.

    However, in this structure, the word is ""ANExy"", where x and y are the last two letters.

    Example words: ""anent"" -> but ""anent"" has E at 3? Yes. But note: ""anent"" has two N's? First N at 2, then another N at 4? We need to check.

    ""anent"": A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5? But we have an N at 4, but we know N cannot be in position 4? From first guess crane: N was in position 4 and we got a minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So if we put ""anent"", we are putting N at both 2 and 4? But position 4 is not allowed for N. So we cannot have an N at position 4.

    So ""anent"" is invalid because of the N at position 4.

    Another word: ""anew""? Not 5 letters.

    ""anemia""? Not 5 letters.

    ""anear"" -> but that has R, which is disallowed.

    ""anele"" -> 5 letters? Meaning: to anoint. But note: this has two E's? A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, L at 4? But L is disallowed (because in panel, L was at 5 and we got x, so L is not in the word). Also, E at 5? We cannot put E at 5? Wait: the word is ""anele"": 
      A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, L at 4 (invalid because L not allowed), E at 5 (invalid because E cannot be at 5).

    So cannot use ""anele"".

    Another: ""anise"" -> but S is acceptable? But in ""anise"": 
      A at 1, N at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is not allowed.

    ""antes"": wait, A at 1, then N? No, ""antes"" is A at 1, N at 2? N at 2? Then T at 3, E at 4? But E cannot be at position 4 -> forbidden by panel's feedback.

    In this structure (A at 1, N at 2, E at 3), we need letters for positions 4 and 5. But E at 3 is okay.

    Possible: ""anise"" fails because E must be at 3? But ""anise"" has E at 5? So we need a word that has E at 3? And then two new consonants at 4 and 5.

    What words have the pattern A N E _ _? 
      Examples: ""anent"" is invalid (double N and position 4 forbidden).
                ""anear"" has R -> invalid.
                ""anela"" -> not English.

    Not common. Maybe this placement is difficult.

  Alternatively, in subcase 1a we have A1, N2, E3 and then positions 4 and 5: we can use two new letters. But we need a word. Let me think of ""anent"" being invalid. How about ""aneze""? Not English.

  It might be hard. Let's try subcase 1b: A at 1, N at 5.

    Then E must be at 2 or 3? Since {2,3} available and E cannot be at 4 or 5? 5 taken by N, so only 2 or 3.

    So two possibilities:

      E at 2: then the word is A E ... N? Positions: 1: A, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: N.
        Word pattern: A E ? ? N
        We need a word that starts with ""AE"", which is rare? But let's see.

        Example: ""aeons"": not 5? ""aegis"" has G and S? But S is okay. 
          ""aegis"": A at 1, E at 2, G at 3, I at 4, S at 5. 
          Then we have G and I as new letters? Okay.

        But note: we must avoid C,R,P,L. Also, the letter N is at position 5? Which was forbidden? For N, we said it cannot be at 3 or 4? 5 is allowed.

        And for E at 2: allowed? We only know E cannot be at 4 or 5.

        However, in this word ""aegis"", we don't have the letter N? Wait, we need N! In this placement, we are putting N at 5? So we must use N at 5? Yes.

        So the word is A, E, then two letters, then N: ""aegis"" does not end with N. 

        How about ""aedon""? Not English.

        ""aeons"": A E O N S -> but then N is at position 4? But N cannot be at 4! Forbidden by crane.

        And also, we are putting N at 4? That is disallowed.

        If E is at 2 and N at 5, then the word must be A E X X N. Valid words: ""agent"": A G E N T -> but that's A at 1, G at 2? Wait, no: ""agent"" is A at 1, G at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5. But N at 4 is forbidden.

        ""women"": W O M E N -> not starting with A E.

        This pattern is challenging.

      Or E at 3: then the word is A ? E ? N -> pattern: A _ E _ N
        Examples: ""agent"": A G E N T -> but again, N at 4 is forbidden? Here N is at 5? ""agent"" has N at 4? Not 5.

        ""allen"" but has L -> disallowed.

        ""adren"" but R disallowed.

        ""atone"": A T O N E -> A at 1, T at 2, O at 3, N at 4? N at 4 forbidden -> invalid.

        ""aisne"" -> not English.

        ""ashen"": A S H E N -> A at 1, S at 2, H at 3, E at 4, N at 5? But E cannot be at 4 -> forbidden.

        ""axmen"": not common.

        It seems difficult to find a word with A at 1 and N at 5.

So maybe placing A at 1 is not fruitful. 

Next, place A at 4? Because A can be at 1,4,5. We tried 1. Let's try 4.

Case 2: A at 4.
  Then positions left: 1,2,3,5.
  N can be at 1,2,5 (avoiding 3,4) -> note 4 taken by A, so 1,2,5.
  E can be at 1,2,3 (avoiding 4,5) -> 4 taken, so 1,2,3.

  So we must assign N and E to different positions from {1,2,5} and {1,2,3}.

  Possible assignments:

    If we put E at 3: then N can be at 1,2,5.
      Then the word pattern: for position 4, we have A. Position 3: E.
      So the word looks like: ? ? E A ? 
      But we have N to place: at positions 1,2, or 5.

      If N at 1: then word: N ? E A ? -> ""N?EA?""
        Examples: ""steak"" but S,T,E,A,K -> E is at position 3 and A at 4? Then N at 1? So must start with N? ""N?EA?"" -> like ""nikea""? Not English. ""urea"" is 4 letters.

        ""arena"": A R E N A -> but R not allowed and also A in position 1? We have A at 4? But ""arena"" has A at 1 and 5? And we already have A at 4? So duplicate? But now position 1: A? But we are putting N at 1? No, conflict.

        Actually, we are putting N at 1. So word: N, ?, then E at 3, A at 4, and then the fifth letter. 
        Example: ""niter"": but we don't know the word? ""niter"" is N I T E R? But that doesn't have A? And R is disallowed.

        ""atnea""? Not valid.

    If N at 2: then word: ? N E A ? 
      Examples: ""oneal""? O N E A L? But L is disallowed.

      ""uneaf""? Not common.

      ""inept"": I N E P T? But P is disallowed? And we have E at 3, A at 4, so pattern: ? N E A ? -> so the first letter cannot be I? Actually, if we put in: first letter ?, then N at 2, E at 3, A at 4. Then the fifth letter.

      Possible letters: not C,R,P,L. So let's think of words ending with EA? ... Not many.

    If N at 5: then word: ? ? E A N
      Pattern: ??EAN
      Examples: ""stean""? Not English?
      ""ocean"": O C E A N -> but O is new? But C is disallowed? Yes, C is disallowed -> invalid.

      ""yeast"": Y E A S T -> but E at position 2? We need E at 3? Pattern: first two letters must be such that E is at 3? Then E at 3, A at 4, N at 5: so pattern: ??EAN.

      Words: ""swean""? Not common. ""glean"": G L E A N -> L disallowed? And we have L disallowed.

      ""quean"": Q U E A N -> Q and U? Then Q not forbidden? ""quean"" is valid? But let's see: it avoids C,R,P,L? Yes? But we haven't tested Q and U.

      Similarly, ""spean""? Not common.

      ""dearn""? D E A R N -> R disallowed.

      It might be hard.

  Alternatively, don't put E at 3? If we put E at 1: then word: E at 1, then positions 2 and 3 available for the letters? And then A at 4.

    Then N must be at 1,2,5? But 1 taken by E, so N at 2 or 5.

    So if N at 2: word: E, N, ?, A, ? -> pattern: EN?A?
      Examples: ""entry"": E N T R Y -> R disallowed? Also, R is disallowed.

      ""endow"": E N D O W -> O and W acceptable? But we don't have A? Where is A? We must have A at 4? So the word must be ""ENsomethingA..."" -> but that's ""EN?A?"" meaning fourth letter A? So ""E N ? A ?"".

      ""entia"" is a word? E N T I A -> that is E at 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4, A at 5? But we want A at 4? So that doesn't match.

      We need the fourth letter to be A? So ""entia"" has A at 5.

      How about ""envoy""? No A.

      We need A at position 4? Not at 5.

      ""entra"": but has R.

    Or if N at 5: then word: E ? ? A N -> pattern: E??AN
      Examples: ""again""? A G A I N -> but A at 1? And we have E? Conflict? The word must start with E.

      ""eatan""? Not English.

      ""beman""? Not English.

      But we have to fill with two letters. Example: ""eolian"": too long.

      ""expan"": not word.

So perhaps putting A at 4 is hard too.

Now, place A at 5? Last position.

Case 3: A at 5.
  Then positions left: 1,2,3,4.
  N must be at 1,2,5? But 5 taken, so at 1 or 2? (avoiding 3,4).
  E must be at 1,2,3? (avoiding 4,5).

  And A at 5.

  So assign N and E.

  Possibilities:

    N at 1: then word: N _ _ _ A
        And E must be at 1,2,3? 1 taken, so 2 or 3.
        If E at 2: word: N E ? ? A -> pattern: NE?..A.
        If E at 3: word: N ? E ? A -> pattern: N?E?A.

    N at 2: then word: _ N _ _ A.
        E at 1 or 3? 

Let's try N at 1 and E at 2: then word: N E ? ? A -> ""NE??A""
  Examples: ""never"" -> N E V E R? But R disallowed and also E at position 2 and 4? The second E? Also, the pattern requires last letter A? Not R.

  ""needs"": N E E D S? Last letter S, not A.

  ""neria"": not common.

  ""necza"": not word.

Not easy.

Try N at 1 and E at 3: then word: N ? E ? A -> ""N?E?A""
  Examples: ""noema""? Note O E M A -> but at positions: N at 1, O at 2, E at 3, M at 4, A at 5? E at 3 is allowed.

  And M is a new letter? So ""noema"" might be a word? It's valid? Yes, meaning a thought or concept.

  But does it meet all:
    - Contains A, N, E.
    - Avoids C,R,P,L? O, E, M: yes.
    - Positions:
        A at 5 -> this is the first time A is at 5? We know from crane: A cannot be at 3 -> 5 is allowed. And in this guess, A is at 5 -> allowed? Yes, because we only have restrictions from the minuses: A cannot be at 2 or 3? 5 is okay.
        N at 1 -> allowed? We only know N cannot be at 3 or 4? 1 is okay.
        E at 3 -> allowed (E only cannot be at 4 or 5? 3 is okay).

  Then the letters: O (new) and M (new) are used.

  But we have to make sure that the word ""noema"" doesn't have any disallowed letter? It has O,E,M,A,N: all allowed? Avoid C,R,P,L.

  So ""noema"" is a possibility.

Another example: ""nisei""? S and I? But S and I are new? But then we don't have E? No, it's N at1, I at2, S at3, E? wait no, we require E at3. ""nisei"": N I S E I -> then E is at 4? We need E at position 3? So no.

""noted"": N O T E D -> E is at 4? But E cannot be at 4 -> forbidden.

""named"": N A M E D -> A at 2? Not allowed? A must be at 5? Here A is at 2? Forbidden by previous feedback.

""naveo""? Not English.

""nema"" too short?

""noema"" seems a good candidate.

But is it English? I think noema is an English word? Or a valid variant?

To ensure commonality, try a more common word.

How about ""cause""? But C disallowed.

Another: ""movie""? M O V I E -> doesn't start with N.

Back to N at 2? If we don't use N at 1, we can do:

  If N at 2: then word: ? N ? ? A
  And E must be at 1 or 2 or 3? But 2 taken by N, so 1 or 3.

  So two subcases:

      E at 1: then word: E N ? ? A -> pattern: EN??A

      E at 3: then word: ? N E ? A -> pattern: ?N E?A

  For pattern EN??A: words: ""enter"": not ending with A.
            ""envya"": ENVYA? V,Y,A? but last letter Y? Wait: ""envya"": E,N,V,Y,A -> positions: E at1, N at2, V at3, Y at4, A at5? Yes.

            But we don't have restrictions on V and Y? And we haven't used them? They are new.

            So ""envya"" is a word? I think it might not be standard.

            ""enough"" -> not ending with A.

            ""enema"": E N E M A -> but this has E at 1 and 3? But our pattern has the fifth letter A? Yes: positions: E at1, N at2, E at3, M at4, A at5. But we have two E's? And the feedback so far has only shown distinct versions? It is word.

            Check the positions for existing letters:
              A: at 5 -> allowed? We only forbidden positions 2 and 3 -> allowed.
              N: at 2 -> allowed? We only forbidden positions 3 and 4 -> allowed.
              E: at 1 and 3 -> 
                 E cannot be at 4 or 5? 1 and 3 are allowed? Yes.

            And avoid P,L,R,C: yes.

            So ""enema"" is a valid word: letters E, N, E, M, A.

            We may get an issue with the feedback? Because we have two E's? But that's okay.

  Let's compare with ""noema"". Also, ""enema"" is commonly known.

But in ""enema"", E is at position 1 and 3. And for the letter E, we know it is in the word, but the secret word might have two E's? It's possible.

However, we used ""crane"" and ""panel"", both had one E? So we had minuses for E? But if we guess ""enema"", we might get:

  If the secret word has only one E? Then one of the E's would be marked as not in the word? But we know that the word has at least one E. We don't know whether two E's? However, our feedback and deductions do not rule out two E's.

So let's consider ""enema"" as an option.

But compare with ""noema"": ""noema"" has been recognized as part of the English language? Let's prefer common words.

""enema"" is more common than ""noema"".

But are there other common words? 

Perhaps ""inane""? But we considered earlier and it had problems. Let me recall: ""inane"" is I N A N E -> but A cannot be at position 3? Because crane had A at 3 minus. And in ""inane"", A is at 3? So invalid.

Alternative: ""usage""? But U,S,A,G,E? But A is at 3? not allowed. And we have to include A and E and N? ""usage"" has A,E,N? Actually, ""usage"": U S A G E -> 
  A is at position 3? -> not allowed? And also we don't have N? So invalid.

Another: ""stage""? S T A G E -> A at 3? not allowed.

""agent"": we considered -> N at 4? not allowed.

Given our constraints, we have two candidates: ""noema"" and ""enema"". ""enema"" is a more common word.

So let's propose ""enema"".

But note: we haven't tested for duplicate E? But the feedback will tell us.

Alternatively, we can choose a word with only one E? But we know that we must have at least one E. And we are forced to put E at an allowed position.

Another word: ""taken"": T A K E N -> A at position 2? Not allowed? From panel feedback: A cannot be at 2 -> forbidden. And N is at 5? But T is new? Also, A at2: disallowed.

""baned"": B A N E D -> A at2: disallowed.

 So we go with ""enema"".

However, let's double-check the feedback for ""enema"":
  The secret word contains A, N, E? Yes.
  The positions: 
    E at1: we don't know if that is correct? But we are guessing.
    N at2: okay
    E at3: okay
    M at4: first time testing M
    A at5: okay? But crane also had minuses for A and E? So crane had A at position 3: that is why A cannot be there? Now we are putting A at5: that is different.

So we'll guess ""enema"".

If we do ""enema"", we are using two E's? Not forbidden.

But we have another option: we could try a word with only one E? For example, we haven't tried assigning A at 4 again? Or other possibilities.

But we are limited by time and common words.

After consideration, I choose ""enema"" because it meets all the constraints and is a valid English word.

So next guess: enema

Let's hope it works.

But note: we also haven't tested many new letters. We are testing E again? But in new positions? Also new letters M and not others.

But it's okay.

Alternatively, if we want to use all five positions effectively, we can try to avoid duplication? But it's not necessary.

Let's go.

<guess>enema</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:

- **Crane**: C (x), R (x), A (-), N (-), E (-)  
  → A, N, and E are present but misplaced; C and R are absent.
- **Panel**: P (x), A (-), N (-), E (-), L (x)  
  → A, N, and E remain misplaced; P and L are absent.

### Key insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**: A, N, E are in the secret word.
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, P, L are excluded.
3. **Position constraints**:
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
   - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
   - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
4. Only positions 1, 4, and 5 are possible for A; positions 1, 2, and 5 for N; and positions 1, 2, and 3 for E.

Given these constraints and the goal to test new letters while including A, N, E, the word **""enema""** fits:
- Positions: E (1), N (2), E (3), M (4), A (5)  
  - A at position 5 (allowed).
  - N at position 2 (allowed).
  - E at positions 1 and 3 (allowed positions; may indicate duplicated E).
- New letters tested: M.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, P, L).

So we must avoid position 5 for E.\n\n Therefore, ""anode"" is invalid because E is at position 5.\n\n Another idea: ""anise""\n   A at 1 (okay, not 3)\n   N at 2 (okay, not 4)\n   I at 3 (new)\n   S at 4 (new)\n   E at 5 -> again, position 5 for E is not allowed.\n\n We need to put E not at position 5.

So position 1 is allowed for E.\n   A at 2 (not 3, okay)\n   T at 3 (new)\n   E at 4? Wait, we have two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. It could be that the word has only one E. However, we don\'t know.\n\n But note: the word ""eaten"" has two E\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. It\'s possible.\n\n However, we must avoid using C and R. ""eaten"" doesn\'t have C or R.\n\n Let\'s check the positions for the known letters in ""eaten"":\n   E: at position 1 and 4. We know that E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn\'t mean there can\'t be two. However, the feedback for the first guess would have shown two minuses if there were two E\'s? Actually, no: in the first guess we only had one E, so we only got one minus. If the word has two E\'s and we guess one, we only get one minus. But if we guess two E\'s and the word has two, then we would get two minuses (or one check and one minus, etc).\n\n So ""eaten"" is a possibility, but let\'s see if we can avoid double letters for now to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, how about ""plane""? \n   P, L, A, N, E.\n   But note: in ""plane"", \n     A is at position 3 -> but we cannot put A at position 3 (because in the first guess A was at 3 and we got a minus, meaning it\'s not at 3). So that\'s invalid.\n\n How about ""panel""?\n   P at 1\n   A at 2 (okay, because previously A was at 3, now at 2 is different)\n   N at 3 (but wait: in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because the feedback only said N is not at position 4, but it could be at 3.\n   E at 4 (previously E was at 5, so position 4 is new and allowed)\n   L at 5.\n\n Also, we are avoiding C and R.\n\n So ""panel"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for A, N, E that we already know are wrong.\n\n In ""panel"":\n   A: position 2 (previously was 3 -> okay)\n   N: position 3 (previously was 4 -> okay, because we are changing from 4 to 3)\n   E: position 4 (previously was 5 -> okay)\n\n And we introduce two new letters: P and L.\n\n So let\'s go with ""panel"".\n\n However, we must also consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t have any indication of that yet.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""slant"", but that doesn\'t have E. We know E is in the word, so we must include E.\n\n Another word: ""snake"" -> but S at 1, N at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is not allowed (because in first guess A was at 3 and we got a minus). So invalid.\n\n Another: ""adobe"" -> \n   A at 1 (okay)\n   D at 2 (new)\n   O at 3 (new)\n   B at 4 (new)\n   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E was at 5 in first guess and we got minus). So invalid.\n\n Another: ""inane"" -> \n   I at 1\n   N at 2 (okay, not 4)\n   A at 3 -> not allowed (A cannot be at 3)\n   N at 4 -> but we know N is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be at 4? Wait, the feedback for the first guess said N was at 4 and got a minus, meaning it\'s not at 4. So we cannot put N at 4. Also, we have two N\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two N\'s.\n\n But in ""inane"", the first N is at position 2 (which is allowed) and the second N is at position 4 (which is not allowed). So we cannot use that.\n\n After considering, ""panel"" seems a good choice.\n\n But note: we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s go with ""panel"".\n\n However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess also told us that the secret word does not have C or R. So we are safe with P and L.\n\n So the next guess: ""panel""\n\n We\'ll see what feedback we get.\n\n<guess>panel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** and **R** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **A**, **N**, and **E** are present but misplaced (marked ""-""):\n  - **A** cannot be in position 3.\n  - **N** cannot be in position 4.\n  - **E** cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A**, **N**, and **E** in new positions.\n- Avoid **C** and **R** entirely.\n- Introduce new letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""panel""** fits perfectly:\n- **A** is in position 2 (not 3).\n- **N** is in position 3 (not 4).\n- **E** is in position 4 (not 5).\n- New letters **P** and **L** are tested.\n- Valid English word, no disallowed letters.\n\n<guess>panel</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nMeaning:\n  C: not in the word\n  R: not in the word\n  A: in the word but not in position 3\n  N: in the word but not in position 4\n  E: in the word but not in position 5\n\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)\nMeaning:\n  P: not in the word\n  A: in the word but not in position 2 (because in panel, A is at position 2 and we got a minus)\n  N: in the word but not in position 3 (because in panel, N is at position 3 and we got a minus)\n  E: in the word but not in position 4 (because in panel, E is at position 4 and we got a minus)\n  L: not in the word\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word contains A, N, E (from both guesses, confirmed by minuses).\n- The secret word does not contain C, R, P, L.\n- We also know the positions where A, N, E cannot be:\n  A: cannot be in position 3 (from crane) and cannot be in position 2 (from panel).\n  N: cannot be in position 4 (from crane) and cannot be in position 3 (from panel).\n  E: cannot be in position 5 (from crane) and cannot be in position 4 (from panel).\n\nWe have three confirmed letters: A, N, E.\n\nThe secret word is 5 letters and must have two more letters that we haven\'t tested yet (or possibly we have tested others? We\'ve tested C,R,P,L and they are out).\n\nWe used two guesses and have four tries left.\n\nWe need to form a word that:\n  - Contains A, N, E.\n  - Avoids C, R, P, L.\n  - Places A not in position 2 or 3.\n  - Places N not in position 3 or 4.\n  - Places E not in position 4 or 5.\n\nWhat positions are available for each?\n  For A: can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5? (since we have eliminated 2 and 3).\n  For N: can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5? (since we have eliminated 3 and 4).\n  For E: can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3? (since we have eliminated 4 and 5).\n\nBut note: each of A, N, E must appear in the word exactly once? Or could there be duplicates? We don\'t have information about duplicates because we haven\'t seen any duplicates in our guesses. However, it\'s possible that the word has duplicate letters? But we only know at least one A, one N, one E.\n\nWe must also introduce two new letters (since we know 3 letters, but not the other two).\n\nLet\'s list the possible positions for A: 1,4,5\nFor N: 1,2,5\nFor E: 1,2,3\n\nBut note: the positions must be distinct because we assume one letter per box? Actually, the word might have repeated letters? But if there were repeated letters, we don\'t have evidence. Also, in our feedback, we haven\'t seen any duplicate letters so far. So we\'ll assume each letter is unique for now.\n\nWe have to assign distinct positions to A, N, E.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that satisfies these constraints and uses two new letters (not C,R,P,L) for the remaining positions.\n\nConsider possible words:\n\nFirst, assign positions:\n\nTry placing A in position 1: then A at 1.\nThen N can be at 2 or 5 (since 1 is taken by A, so 1 is not available for N).\nThen E must be at 2,3? But if N is at 2 then E cannot be at 2? Conflict if N is at 2.\n\nCase 1: A at 1.\n  Then positions left: 2,3,4,5.\n  N must be in {1,2,5} -> but 1 taken, so {2,5}. \n  E must be in {1,2,3} -> 1 taken, so {2,3}.\n\n  So two subcases:\n\n  Subcase 1a: N at 2.\n    Then E must be at 3 (since only {2,3} but 2 taken by N).\n    Then the word has A at 1, N at 2, E at 3.\n    Then positions 4 and 5 must be filled with two new letters (say X and Y).\n    Word so far: A N E _ _\n    So ""ANE??"". We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""ANE"" and uses letters not in {C,R,P,L} and avoids duplicates? We don\'t know about duplicates.\n\n    Example words: ""anode"", but O and D? But we must avoid positions? Remember, E is at 3? But we know E cannot be at position 3? No: wait, we have no feedback that E cannot be at 3? Let\'s see:\n\n    For E: we only know it cannot be at 4 and 5. Position 3 is allowed.\n\n    However, in this structure, the word is ""ANExy"", where x and y are the last two letters.\n\n    Example words: ""anent"" -> but ""anent"" has E at 3? Yes. But note: ""anent"" has two N\'s? First N at 2, then another N at 4? We need to check.\n\n    ""anent"": A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5? But we have an N at 4, but we know N cannot be in position 4? From first guess crane: N was in position 4 and we got a minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So if we put ""anent"", we are putting N at both 2 and 4? But position 4 is not allowed for N. So we cannot have an N at position 4.\n\n    So ""anent"" is invalid because of the N at position 4.\n\n    Another word: ""anew""? Not 5 letters.\n\n    ""anemia""? Not 5 letters.\n\n    ""anear"" -> but that has R, which is disallowed.\n\n    ""anele"" -> 5 letters? Meaning: to anoint. But note: this has two E\'s? A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, L at 4? But L is disallowed (because in panel, L was at 5 and we got x, so L is not in the word). Also, E at 5? We cannot put E at 5? Wait: the word is ""anele"": \n      A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, L at 4 (invalid because L not allowed), E at 5 (invalid because E cannot be at 5).\n\n    So cannot use ""anele"".\n\n    Another: ""anise"" -> but S is acceptable? But in ""anise"": \n      A at 1, N at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n    ""antes"": wait, A at 1, then N? No, ""antes"" is A at 1, N at 2? N at 2? Then T at 3, E at 4? But E cannot be at position 4 -> forbidden by panel\'s feedback.\n\n    In this structure (A at 1, N at 2, E at 3), we need letters for positions 4 and 5. But E at 3 is okay.\n\n    Possible: ""anise"" fails because E must be at 3? But ""anise"" has E at 5? So we need a word that has E at 3? And then two new consonants at 4 and 5.\n\n    What words have the pattern A N E _ _? \n      Examples: ""anent"" is invalid (double N and position 4 forbidden).\n                ""anear"" has R -> invalid.\n                ""anela"" -> not English.\n\n    Not common. Maybe this placement is difficult.\n\n  Alternatively, in subcase 1a we have A1, N2, E3 and then positions 4 and 5: we can use two new letters. But we need a word. Let me think of ""anent"" being invalid. How about ""aneze""? Not English.\n\n  It might be hard. Let\'s try subcase 1b: A at 1, N at 5.\n\n    Then E must be at 2 or 3? Since {2,3} available and E cannot be at 4 or 5? 5 taken by N, so only 2 or 3.\n\n    So two possibilities:\n\n      E at 2: then the word is A E ... N? Positions: 1: A, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: N.\n        Word pattern: A E ? ? N\n        We need a word that starts with ""AE"", which is rare? But let\'s see.\n\n        Example: ""aeons"": not 5? ""aegis"" has G and S? But S is okay. \n          ""aegis"": A at 1, E at 2, G at 3, I at 4, S at 5. \n          Then we have G and I as new letters? Okay.\n\n        But note: we must avoid C,R,P,L. Also, the letter N is at position 5? Which was forbidden? For N, we said it cannot be at 3 or 4? 5 is allowed.\n\n        And for E at 2: allowed? We only know E cannot be at 4 or 5.\n\n        However, in this word ""aegis"", we don\'t have the letter N? Wait, we need N! In this placement, we are putting N at 5? So we must use N at 5? Yes.\n\n        So the word is A, E, then two letters, then N: ""aegis"" does not end with N. \n\n        How about ""aedon""? Not English.\n\n        ""aeons"": A E O N S -> but then N is at position 4? But N cannot be at 4! Forbidden by crane.\n\n        And also, we are putting N at 4? That is disallowed.\n\n        If E is at 2 and N at 5, then the word must be A E X X N. Valid words: ""agent"": A G E N T -> but that\'s A at 1, G at 2? Wait, no: ""agent"" is A at 1, G at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5. But N at 4 is forbidden.\n\n        ""women"": W O M E N -> not starting with A E.\n\n        This pattern is challenging.\n\n      Or E at 3: then the word is A ? E ? N -> pattern: A _ E _ N\n        Examples: ""agent"": A G E N T -> but again, N at 4 is forbidden? Here N is at 5? ""agent"" has N at 4? Not 5.\n\n        ""allen"" but has L -> disallowed.\n\n        ""adren"" but R disallowed.\n\n        ""atone"": A T O N E -> A at 1, T at 2, O at 3, N at 4? N at 4 forbidden -> invalid.\n\n        ""aisne"" -> not English.\n\n        ""ashen"": A S H E N -> A at 1, S at 2, H at 3, E at 4, N at 5? But E cannot be at 4 -> forbidden.\n\n        ""axmen"": not common.\n\n        It seems difficult to find a word with A at 1 and N at 5.\n\nSo maybe placing A at 1 is not fruitful. \n\nNext, place A at 4? Because A can be at 1,4,5. We tried 1. Let\'s try 4.\n\nCase 2: A at 4.\n  Then positions left: 1,2,3,5.\n  N can be at 1,2,5 (avoiding 3,4) -> note 4 taken by A, so 1,2,5.\n  E can be at 1,2,3 (avoiding 4,5) -> 4 taken, so 1,2,3.\n\n  So we must assign N and E to different positions from {1,2,5} and {1,2,3}.\n\n  Possible assignments:\n\n    If we put E at 3: then N can be at 1,2,5.\n      Then the word pattern: for position 4, we have A. Position 3: E.\n      So the word looks like: ? ? E A ? \n      But we have N to place: at positions 1,2, or 5.\n\n      If N at 1: then word: N ? E A ? -> ""N?EA?""\n        Examples: ""steak"" but S,T,E,A,K -> E is at position 3 and A at 4? Then N at 1? So must start with N? ""N?EA?"" -> like ""nikea""? Not English. ""urea"" is 4 letters.\n\n        ""arena"": A R E N A -> but R not allowed and also A in position 1? We have A at 4? But ""arena"" has A at 1 and 5? And we already have A at 4? So duplicate? But now position 1: A? But we are putting N at 1? No, conflict.\n\n        Actually, we are putting N at 1. So word: N, ?, then E at 3, A at 4, and then the fifth letter. \n        Example: ""niter"": but we don\'t know the word? ""niter"" is N I T E R? But that doesn\'t have A? And R is disallowed.\n\n        ""atnea""? Not valid.\n\n    If N at 2: then word: ? N E A ? \n      Examples: ""oneal""? O N E A L? But L is disallowed.\n\n      ""uneaf""? Not common.\n\n      ""inept"": I N E P T? But P is disallowed? And we have E at 3, A at 4, so pattern: ? N E A ? -> so the first letter cannot be I? Actually, if we put in: first letter ?, then N at 2, E at 3, A at 4. Then the fifth letter.\n\n      Possible letters: not C,R,P,L. So let\'s think of words ending with EA? ... Not many.\n\n    If N at 5: then word: ? ? E A N\n      Pattern: ??EAN\n      Examples: ""stean""? Not English?\n      ""ocean"": O C E A N -> but O is new? But C is disallowed? Yes, C is disallowed -> invalid.\n\n      ""yeast"": Y E A S T -> but E at position 2? We need E at 3? Pattern: first two letters must be such that E is at 3? Then E at 3, A at 4, N at 5: so pattern: ??EAN.\n\n      Words: ""swean""? Not common. ""glean"": G L E A N -> L disallowed? And we have L disallowed.\n\n      ""quean"": Q U E A N -> Q and U? Then Q not forbidden? ""quean"" is valid? But let\'s see: it avoids C,R,P,L? Yes? But we haven\'t tested Q and U.\n\n      Similarly, ""spean""? Not common.\n\n      ""dearn""? D E A R N -> R disallowed.\n\n      It might be hard.\n\n  Alternatively, don\'t put E at 3? If we put E at 1: then word: E at 1, then positions 2 and 3 available for the letters? And then A at 4.\n\n    Then N must be at 1,2,5? But 1 taken by E, so N at 2 or 5.\n\n    So if N at 2: word: E, N, ?, A, ? -> pattern: EN?A?\n      Examples: ""entry"": E N T R Y -> R disallowed? Also, R is disallowed.\n\n      ""endow"": E N D O W -> O and W acceptable? But we don\'t have A? Where is A? We must have A at 4? So the word must be ""ENsomethingA..."" -> but that\'s ""EN?A?"" meaning fourth letter A? So ""E N ? A ?"".\n\n      ""entia"" is a word? E N T I A -> that is E at 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4, A at 5? But we want A at 4? So that doesn\'t match.\n\n      We need the fourth letter to be A? So ""entia"" has A at 5.\n\n      How about ""envoy""? No A.\n\n      We need A at position 4? Not at 5.\n\n      ""entra"": but has R.\n\n    Or if N at 5: then word: E ? ? A N -> pattern: E??AN\n      Examples: ""again""? A G A I N -> but A at 1? And we have E? Conflict? The word must start with E.\n\n      ""eatan""? Not English.\n\n      ""beman""? Not English.\n\n      But we have to fill with two letters. Example: ""eolian"": too long.\n\n      ""expan"": not word.\n\nSo perhaps putting A at 4 is hard too.\n\nNow, place A at 5? Last position.\n\nCase 3: A at 5.\n  Then positions left: 1,2,3,4.\n  N must be at 1,2,5? But 5 taken, so at 1 or 2? (avoiding 3,4).\n  E must be at 1,2,3? (avoiding 4,5).\n\n  And A at 5.\n\n  So assign N and E.\n\n  Possibilities:\n\n    N at 1: then word: N _ _ _ A\n        And E must be at 1,2,3? 1 taken, so 2 or 3.\n        If E at 2: word: N E ? ? A -> pattern: NE?..A.\n        If E at 3: word: N ? E ? A -> pattern: N?E?A.\n\n    N at 2: then word: _ N _ _ A.\n        E at 1 or 3? \n\nLet\'s try N at 1 and E at 2: then word: N E ? ? A -> ""NE??A""\n  Examples: ""never"" -> N E V E R? But R disallowed and also E at position 2 and 4? The second E? Also, the pattern requires last letter A? Not R.\n\n  ""needs"": N E E D S? Last letter S, not A.\n\n  ""neria"": not common.\n\n  ""necza"": not word.\n\nNot easy.\n\nTry N at 1 and E at 3: then word: N ? E ? A -> ""N?E?A""\n  Examples: ""noema""? Note O E M A -> but at positions: N at 1, O at 2, E at 3, M at 4, A at 5? E at 3 is allowed.\n\n  And M is a new letter? So ""noema"" might be a word? It\'s valid? Yes, meaning a thought or concept.\n\n  But does it meet all:\n    - Contains A, N, E.\n    - Avoids C,R,P,L? O, E, M: yes.\n    - Positions:\n        A at 5 -> this is the first time A is at 5? We know from crane: A cannot be at 3 -> 5 is allowed. And in this guess, A is at 5 -> allowed? Yes, because we only have restrictions from the minuses: A cannot be at 2 or 3? 5 is okay.\n        N at 1 -> allowed? We only know N cannot be at 3 or 4? 1 is okay.\n        E at 3 -> allowed (E only cannot be at 4 or 5? 3 is okay).\n\n  Then the letters: O (new) and M (new) are used.\n\n  But we have to make sure that the word ""noema"" doesn\'t have any disallowed letter? It has O,E,M,A,N: all allowed? Avoid C,R,P,L.\n\n  So ""noema"" is a possibility.\n\nAnother example: ""nisei""? S and I? But S and I are new? But then we don\'t have E? No, it\'s N at1, I at2, S at3, E? wait no, we require E at3. ""nisei"": N I S E I -> then E is at 4? We need E at position 3? So no.\n\n""noted"": N O T E D -> E is at 4? But E cannot be at 4 -> forbidden.\n\n""named"": N A M E D -> A at 2? Not allowed? A must be at 5? Here A is at 2? Forbidden by previous feedback.\n\n""naveo""? Not English.\n\n""nema"" too short?\n\n""noema"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut is it English? I think noema is an English word? Or a valid variant?\n\nTo ensure commonality, try a more common word.\n\nHow about ""cause""? But C disallowed.\n\nAnother: ""movie""? M O V I E -> doesn\'t start with N.\n\nBack to N at 2? If we don\'t use N at 1, we can do:\n\n  If N at 2: then word: ? N ? ? A\n  And E must be at 1 or 2 or 3? But 2 taken by N, so 1 or 3.\n\n  So two subcases:\n\n      E at 1: then word: E N ? ? A -> pattern: EN??A\n\n      E at 3: then word: ? N E ? A -> pattern: ?N E?A\n\n  For pattern EN??A: words: ""enter"": not ending with A.\n            ""envya"": ENVYA? V,Y,A? but last letter Y? Wait: ""envya"": E,N,V,Y,A -> positions: E at1, N at2, V at3, Y at4, A at5? Yes.\n\n            But we don\'t have restrictions on V and Y? And we haven\'t used them? They are new.\n\n            So ""envya"" is a word? I think it might not be standard.\n\n            ""enough"" -> not ending with A.\n\n            ""enema"": E N E M A -> but this has E at 1 and 3? But our pattern has the fifth letter A? Yes: positions: E at1, N at2, E at3, M at4, A at5. But we have two E\'s? And the feedback so far has only shown distinct versions? It is word.\n\n            Check the positions for existing letters:\n              A: at 5 -> allowed? We only forbidden positions 2 and 3 -> allowed.\n              N: at 2 -> allowed? We only forbidden positions 3 and 4 -> allowed.\n              E: at 1 and 3 -> \n                 E cannot be at 4 or 5? 1 and 3 are allowed? Yes.\n\n            And avoid P,L,R,C: yes.\n\n            So ""enema"" is a valid word: letters E, N, E, M, A.\n\n            We may get an issue with the feedback? Because we have two E\'s? But that\'s okay.\n\n  Let\'s compare with ""noema"". Also, ""enema"" is commonly known.\n\nBut in ""enema"", E is at position 1 and 3. And for the letter E, we know it is in the word, but the secret word might have two E\'s? It\'s possible.\n\nHowever, we used ""crane"" and ""panel"", both had one E? So we had minuses for E? But if we guess ""enema"", we might get:\n\n  If the secret word has only one E? Then one of the E\'s would be marked as not in the word? But we know that the word has at least one E. We don\'t know whether two E\'s? However, our feedback and deductions do not rule out two E\'s.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""enema"" as an option.\n\nBut compare with ""noema"": ""noema"" has been recognized as part of the English language? Let\'s prefer common words.\n\n""enema"" is more common than ""noema"".\n\nBut are there other common words? \n\nPerhaps ""inane""? But we considered earlier and it had problems. Let me recall: ""inane"" is I N A N E -> but A cannot be at position 3? Because crane had A at 3 minus. And in ""inane"", A is at 3? So invalid.\n\nAlternative: ""usage""? But U,S,A,G,E? But A is at 3? not allowed. And we have to include A and E and N? ""usage"" has A,E,N? Actually, ""usage"": U S A G E -> \n  A is at position 3? -> not allowed? And also we don\'t have N? So invalid.\n\nAnother: ""stage""? S T A G E -> A at 3? not allowed.\n\n""agent"": we considered -> N at 4? not allowed.\n\nGiven our constraints, we have two candidates: ""noema"" and ""enema"". ""enema"" is a more common word.\n\nSo let\'s propose ""enema"".\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested for duplicate E? But the feedback will tell us.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word with only one E? But we know that we must have at least one E. And we are forced to put E at an allowed position.\n\nAnother word: ""taken"": T A K E N -> A at position 2? Not allowed? From panel feedback: A cannot be at 2 -> forbidden. And N is at 5? But T is new? Also, A at2: disallowed.\n\n""baned"": B A N E D -> A at2: disallowed.\n\n So we go with ""enema"".\n\nHowever, let\'s double-check the feedback for ""enema"":\n  The secret word contains A, N, E? Yes.\n  The positions: \n    E at1: we don\'t know if that is correct? But we are guessing.\n    N at2: okay\n    E at3: okay\n    M at4: first time testing M\n    A at5: okay? But crane also had minuses for A and E? So crane had A at position 3: that is why A cannot be there? Now we are putting A at5: that is different.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""enema"".\n\nIf we do ""enema"", we are using two E\'s? Not forbidden.\n\nBut we have another option: we could try a word with only one E? For example, we haven\'t tried assigning A at 4 again? Or other possibilities.\n\nBut we are limited by time and common words.\n\nAfter consideration, I choose ""enema"" because it meets all the constraints and is a valid English word.\n\nSo next guess: enema\n\nLet\'s hope it works.\n\nBut note: we also haven\'t tested many new letters. We are testing E again? But in new positions? Also new letters M and not others.\n\nBut it\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to use all five positions effectively, we can try to avoid duplication? But it\'s not necessary.\n\nLet\'s go.\n\n<guess>enema</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:\n\n- **Crane**: C (x), R (x), A (-), N (-), E (-)  \n  → A, N, and E are present but misplaced; C and R are absent.\n- **Panel**: P (x), A (-), N (-), E (-), L (x)  \n  → A, N, and E remain misplaced; P and L are absent.\n\n### Key insights:\n1. **Confirmed letters**: A, N, E are in the secret word.\n2. **Absent letters**: C, R, P, L are excluded.\n3. **Position constraints**:\n   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.\n   - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.\n   - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.\n4. Only positions 1, 4, and 5 are possible for A; positions 1, 2, and 5 for N; and positions 1, 2, and 3 for E.\n\nGiven these constraints and the goal to test new letters while including A, N, E, the word **""enema""** fits:\n- Positions: E (1), N (2), E (3), M (4), A (5)  \n  - A at position 5 (allowed).\n  - N at position 2 (allowed).\n  - E at positions 1 and 3 (allowed positions; may indicate duplicated E).\n- New letters tested: M.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, P, L).\n\n<guess>enema</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: enema -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) E(-) M(x) A(-)\n'}]","<think>
We are given feedback for the third guess ""enema"":
  E(-) at position 1: E is in the word but not at position 1.
  N(-) at position 2: N is in the word but not at position 2.
  E(-) at position 3: E is in the word but not at position 3.
  M(x) at position 4: M is not in the word.
  A(-) at position 5: A is in the word but not at position 5.

Now we summarize all we know:

Confirmed letters in the word: A, N, E (from all feedback) and no others? Because we have feedback that excludes C,R,P,L,M.

Therefore, the secret word must contain exactly the letters A, N, E, and two additional letters (since we haven't found them yet).

But wait: we know only three letters are confirmed, and we used all three in enema? However, we got minuses for A, N, E in enema? Meaning they are in the word but not in those positions? And we also got two minuses for E? Meaning there might be two E's? But in enema, we had E at 1, N at 2, E at 3, M at 4 (absent), A at 5.

But from the feedback: all occurrences of E got minuses? So E is not at position 1, not at position 3? So E must be in a different position? But the only positions left are 2,4? But wait: position 4 we tried M? But E must be in the word? How many E's are there?

We also know from enema that A is not at 5? So A must be at a position that hasn't been tried? Similarly for N at 2? Not allowed.

Now, let's collect all position constraints:

For A:
  Cannot be at 2 (from panel) and 3 (from crane) and 5 (from enema).
  Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 4.

For N:
  Cannot be at 3 (from panel) and 4 (from crane) and 2 (from enema).
  Therefore, N must be at position 1 or 5.

For E:
  Cannot be at 5 (from crane) and 4 (from panel) and now also not at 1 (enema) and not at 3 (enema).
  So E must be at position 2? Because that is the only allowed position left? Because positions available: 1,2,3,4,5; we exclude 1,3 (enema), 4 (panel) and 5 (crane) -> so only position 2.

Therefore, E must be at position 2? Because that is the only possible position for E.

But note: we have E(minus) at position 1 and 3 in enema? But that doesn't preclude E from being at position 2? Actually, yes: the feedback says E is in the word but not at 1 and not at 3? So if there is one E? Then it must be at 2? Or if there are two E's? Then we have an issue? Because we already ruled out positions 4 and 5 for E? And positions 1 and 3 are also not allowed? Then position 2 is the only option? But what about duplicates? The secret word has only one E? Or two?

But if there is only one E? Then it must be at position 2? Because all other positions are forbidden.

If there are two E's? Then we have a problem because we don't have enough positions? But let's see: the secret word contains E? And we know it must be somewhere? If there is one E? Then it must be at 2? If there are two E's? Then one could be at 2? And the other? But there is no other position? Because all other positions for E are forbidden? We cannot put E at 1,3,4,5? Then we must have exactly one E? At position 2.

Therefore, we know that E is at position 2? Yes? So the secret word has E in the second position? And only one E? Because if there were two, one would have been placed at an forbidden position? But the feedback only shows E as present but in the wrong positions? It doesn't tell us how many? But if we have two E? Then we must place two? But we cannot? So we assume one E? At position 2.

But note: in enema? We had two E's? And we got two minuses? Meaning both were not in the correct position? But we also know there is an E? So having an E at position 2? Then when we guessed enema, we put E at 1 and 3? Which were both wrong? So we should get minuses? And if E is also present at position 2? Then we already have an E at 2? But we didn't guess E at 2? We guessed enema? So no symbol for E at position 2? That's okay? Because we guessed E at positions 1 and 3? And the E at position 2? Doesn't affect our guess? Because we didn't put a letter there? No? Wait: in enema? We put E at 1, N at 2, E at 3? So at position 2: we put N? So that is a different letter? So E at position 2? Then we had E at 1 and 3? Which are incorrect? So we get minuses? And position 4: we put M? And position 5: A? And we got minuses for A as well.

But we didn't get anything for position 2? Because we put N? And we got a minus for N? Because N is in the word but not at position 2? Which we already know? So that's consistent.

Now, with E fixed at position 2? We assign A and N:

A must be at position 1 or 4.
N must be at position 1 or 5.

Wait? Can they both be at 1? No? Only one letter per position.

Therefore, we must assign:
  Option 1: A at position 4? And N at position 5? Then position 1 and 3 are for the remaining two letters? And position 2 is E? Already set.

  Option 2: A at position 1? And then N can be at position 5? But if A is at 1, then N cannot be at 1? So N must be at 5? Then position 3 and 4 are for remaining letters? Right? Position 2 is E? Position 1: A? Position 5: N? Positions left: 3 and 4.

  Option 3: A at position 1? N at position 5? Also? That's Option2.

  Option 4: A at position 4? N at position 1? Then we have position 3 and 5 to fill.

So three distinct cases:

Case A:
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: E
  Position 5: N
  Then positions 3 and 4: two new letters? Say X and Y.

Case B:
  Position 1: N
  Position 2: E
  Position 4: A
  Then positions 3 and 5: two new letters.

Case C:
  Position 1: ... not A or N? If we do:
  Position 1: N
  Position 2: E
  Position 5: N? But position 5: we put N? But we only have one N? Because N(minus) at position 2? Doesn't say how many? So it could be more? But we don't know? So we don't assume duplicates? Or?

But from N(minus) in previous guesses? We think there is one N? So probably Case B: Position 1: N, 2: E, 4: A? Then positions 3 and 5: two letters.

But Case A is also valid: position 1: A, 2: E, 5: N? Then positions 3 and 4.

And Case D? Only these two? Because if we do A at 1 and N at 5? That's Case A? Or A at 4 and N at 5? Then position 1 is another letter? And position 3? So:

Case D:
  Position 4: A
  Position 2: E
  Position 5: N
  Then positions 1 and 3: two letters.

But note N must be at 1 or 5? So in Case D: we put N at position 5? Which is allowed? And A at 4? Allowed.

So we have three main cases:

Case A: A in 1, E in 2, N in 5? Then the pattern: A E ? ? N

Case B: N in 1, E in 2, A in 4? Then the pattern: N E ? A ?

Case C: E in 2, A in 4, N in 5? Then pattern: ? E ? A N

We must avoid C,R,P,L,M? And we haven't tested other letters? So the new letters must be in the English alphabet? But not in the forbidden list.

We need to form a valid word for each case? Then see which one has words? Or use the fact that we have only six tries? So we make a guess that tests these possibilities.

But we also need to include the two unknown letters? And we have to guess a word that uses the known constraints.

Let's try to form words for each case:

Case A: A E ? ? N
  The word starts with AE and ends with N? With two letters in between.

  Examples: ""aeion""? Not English.
  ""aesin""? Not word.
  ""taken"": T A K E N? But A is at position 2? Not position 1? Here we need A at 1? Then E at 2? And N at 5? With two letters at 3 and 4? So pattern: A E ? ? N? 
    ""aegin""? Not common? ""amber"": A M B E R? Not ... 
    ""agent"": A G E N T? Not A E ... then N? because E at 2? Here E is at 3? So no.

    ""aesne""? Not word.

  How about ""athen""? Not English? 
    Actually, ""aeons"" is not? 
    ""adren"": R disallowed.

  It might be hard.

Case B: N E ? A ?
  Examples: ""never""? N E V E R? R disallowed? And also E at position 4? But we put A at position 4? Then V,E? But E at 3? Then R disallowed? Also, ""never"" has E twice? Not necessarily a problem? But R disallowed.

  ""nerva"": N E R V A? R disallowed? And V and A? At positions? 
    N at1, E at2, R at3, V at4? But we need A at4? So if we put A at4? V? We put A at4? But V at4? Not same? 
    Also A at4? Then the pattern would be N E ? A ? -> so if we have a word like N E X A Y?

  How about ""netra""? But R disallowed? 
    ""newsa""? Not word? 
    ""neala"": N E A L A? But L disallowed? And also positions: we need N at1, E at2, and then A cannot be at3? Because we have A at position 4? So the third letter must be something else? Then A at4? Then fifth? 
    ""neata""? Not English.

  How common: ""neats"": N E A T S? But that's A at position 3? But we need A at position 4? So not.

  ""needs"": N E E D S? If A were at4? But we don't put A at4? Unless? We are forced: we designated position 4 for A? So ""needs"" has E at3 and D at4? So we put D at4? But we need A at4? So inconsistent.

  So it has to be a word with ""ne"" followed by two letters? Then A? Then any letter? Like ""ne? A?""

  Words: ""nebula""? N E B U L A? But L and not A at4? 
    ""nebata"" -> not word.

  Perhaps ""nexus"": N E X U S? But no A? But we must have A? So no.

Case C: ? E ? A N
  Pattern: two letters? Then E? Then any? Then A? Then N? Or specifically: position 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: A, 5: N? So _ E _ A N.

  Example words: ""depart"": D E P A R? But R and disallowed? Also, last letter T? Not N? 
    ""delay"": too short? 
    ""began"": B E G A N? 
      Positions: B at1, E at2, G at3, A at4, N at5? 
      But does it avoid C,R,P,L,M? Yes? G and B? new. 
      And positions meet: 
        A at4? We allowed A at4? Yes? 
        N at5? Allowed? 
        E at2? Must? Yes? 
        Also, the constraints: 
          Crane: N at position 4? We put N at5? So not 4? good. 
          Panel: E at position 4? But we put E at2? not 4? good. 
          Enema: E at position 1 and 3? But we don't have E at1? We have E at2? so this E at2 is correct? But wait: we are guessing E at2? So if the pattern is _ E _ A N? Then ""began"" fits.

  But is that the feedback? We haven't guessed ""began""? But let's see: we know E at2? So if we guess ""began"", we get:
    Position 1: B? If B is in the word? 
    Position 2: E? If E is at2? So we would get a check? 
    Position 3: G? 
    Position 4: A? So we might get a minus? Since A cannot be at4? Wait: why can't A be at4? We said A can be at position 4? Because A cannot be at2,3,5? So only 1 and 4? And we are putting A at4? So that is the only other possibility? So it's fine.

  But let's see: we haven't told that B or G are in the word? We don't know? But we must try.

  Similarly, other words? ""human"": H U M A N? 
    Positions: H at1, U at2, M at3, A at4, N at5? 
    But U at2? But position 2 is E? Must be E? So we cannot have U at2.

  ""began"" has E at2? And A at4? N at5? And we avoid C,R,P,L,M? Yes.

  Also, ""began"" has been used in previous Wordle games? So it is valid.

  Another word: ""woman"": W O M A N? But M is disallowed? Because in enema? M at4 got x? So M not in word? Disallowed.

  ""begin"": B E G I N? Not _ E _ A N? Because it has I and N? Not A.

  How about ""sedan"": S E D A N? 
    Positions: S at1, E at2, D at3, A at4, N at5? 
    Avoid C,R,P,L,M? Yes? S and D? new.

  So ""sedan"" also fits.

  ""weigh"": not ... no A.

  So two options: ""began"" and ""sedan"".

But in both words, E is at position 2? And A at4? N at5.

Also, Case C? We have E at2? So the E must be at2? Because it is fixed? So if we guess ""began"" or ""sedan"", we are covering this case.

But what about Case B? Case B was N E ? A ?? With N at1, E at2, A at4? And we didn't find a word? But what if the word exists?

Example: ""neala"": not word? 
  ""neesa""? Not? 
  ""nevia"": N E V I A? Then at4? We put I? But in the pattern: position 4 must be A? So we put A at4? So unless the word is like ""new a"" but not? 
  How about ""neater"": too long? 
  ""neara"": Not? 
  ""nejati"": no.

So probably no common word? So we focus on Case C.

Now? What about Case A? We haven't found a word for A? But Case A is: A E ? ? N? 
  ""aesip""? Not? 
  ""aetyn""? Not? 
  ""aexit""? Not.

  The only common word I think of: ""aeons""? But that's A E O N S? Then O at3? N at4? But we need the word to end with N? And two letters in between? But ""aeons"" is A E O N S? Then N is at4? Which is forbidden? Because N cannot be at4? From crane? So invalid.

  Also: ""agent"": A G E N T? Then E at3? N at4? And positions? But we said N cannot be at4? This is forbidden.

  Therefore, Case A is unlikely? So Case C is more likely.

Therefore, we guess a word fitting the pattern: _ E _ A N? Avoiding C,R,P,L,M? And the same letter set?

Of course, we have ""began"", ""sedan"", ""rebeg"" not? Or ""defat"" not?

Others: ""detain""? But T not allowed? Position? ""detan"" not? 

But we must avoid M,L,R,P,C? So ""began"": B E G A N? Avoid these.
  ""sedan"": S E D A N? Avoid these.

Also: ""taxed"": T A X E D? Not pattern _ E _ A N? Wrong.

  ""apart"": has A in wrong positions.

We choose between ""began"" and ""sedan"".

Since both are valid? And we are on the fourth guess? We can choose one? And if not? Next guess? But we prefer to guess the word that might give us more info? Or solve? But we might not succeed? So we choose one.

How about we consider the first guess ""crane"" had A and N minuses? But didn't tell positions? And we haven't tested B, G, S, D? Before? So ""began"" tests B and G? ""sedan"" tests S and D? 

But both are good? But we didn't test any B or S? Or D? Or G? 

To maximize information? But we want to solve the puzzle? Since we are limited to 6 guesses? And we have to use 4? So we guess one.

We can also think: if we guess ""began"", and it's not the word, we get feedback? Then we know? Similarly for ""sedan"". But we have two choices? Or more? How about ""pecan""? P disallowed? 

Another: ""tread"": T R E A D? R disallowed? 

So let's go with ""sedan""? Because S and D are common? Or ""began""? 

Wait? We need the word to be accepted? Both are valid English words? And 5 letters? 

Another option: ""weald"": W E A L D? But L disallowed? No? L not allowed? From panel: L(x) disallowed? So cannot.

I'll choose ""began"" as a guess.

But ""began"": 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: E (should be correct? Because we fixed E at2)
  Position 3: G
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: N

So if E is fixed at 2? Then we should get a check for position 2? And for position 5? N? And if A at4 is correct? Also a check? Then we would solve? But we don't know if A at4 is the correct? We only know that A must be at position 4 if it isn't at position 1? But we are not sure? Because Case B? But Case B seems unlikely? So high chance.

Also? What if E at2 is correct? Then position 2 is E? And we have it? Then the whole word might be ""began""? 

So guess ""began"".

Alternatively? We have another constraints? For example? In crane? Position 3 was A? And we got minus? Now we put G at3? If G is new? Then it might be present? Or absent? We don't know.

Similarly? Panel: we had A at2? Minus? And now we have A at4? So if A is at4? We should get a check? Or wait: in this? 

Actually? We are guessing? So let's just guess ""began"".

So next guess: began

Note: but we also have the possibility of Case B? With N E ? A ?? And we haven't found a word? So probably Case C is correct.

So <guess>began</guess>
</think>
After gathering feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Crane**: Eliminated C, R; confirmed A, N, E are present but misplaced.
- **Panel**: Eliminated P, L; confirmed A, N, E remain misplaced (positions 2, 3, 4 excluded for A, N, E respectively).
- **Enema**: Eliminated M; confirmed:
  - E cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (added to existing constraints).
  - A cannot be in position 5 (added to constraints).
  - All occurrences of E in ""enema"" were misplaced, suggesting E is limited to position 2 (the only remaining valid position).

### Position constraints summary:
- **A**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → must be in position 1 or 4.
- **N**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → must be in position 1 or 5.
- **E**: Cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 → must be in position 2.
- Excluded letters: C, R, P, L, M.

### Deduction:
E is fixed at position 2. All valid word solutions must fit one of these patterns:
1. **A E _ _ N** (A at 1, N at 5)  
2. **N E _ A _** (N at 1, A at 4)  
3. **\_ E _ A N** (A at 4, N at 5)

After testing possible words against the constraints and excluded letters, the pattern **\_ E _ A N** yields the most feasible solution. The word **""began""** fits this pattern perfectly:
- **B** (position 1, new letter)  
- **E** (position 2, correct placement)  
- **G** (position 3, new letter)  
- **A** (position 4, satisfies constraints)  
- **N** (position 5, satisfies constraints)  

""Began"" uses valid English letters, avoids excluded characters (C, R, P, L, M), and adheres to all positional constraints.

<guess>began</guess>",began,"We are given feedback for the third guess ""enema"":
  E(-) at position 1: E is in the word but not at position 1.
  N(-) at position 2: N is in the word but not at position 2.
  E(-) at position 3: E is in the word but not at position 3.
  M(x) at position 4: M is not in the word.
  A(-) at position 5: A is in the word but not at position 5.

Now we summarize all we know:

Confirmed letters in the word: A, N, E (from all feedback) and no others? Because we have feedback that excludes C,R,P,L,M.

Therefore, the secret word must contain exactly the letters A, N, E, and two additional letters (since we haven't found them yet).

But wait: we know only three letters are confirmed, and we used all three in enema? However, we got minuses for A, N, E in enema? Meaning they are in the word but not in those positions? And we also got two minuses for E? Meaning there might be two E's? But in enema, we had E at 1, N at 2, E at 3, M at 4 (absent), A at 5.

But from the feedback: all occurrences of E got minuses? So E is not at position 1, not at position 3? So E must be in a different position? But the only positions left are 2,4? But wait: position 4 we tried M? But E must be in the word? How many E's are there?

We also know from enema that A is not at 5? So A must be at a position that hasn't been tried? Similarly for N at 2? Not allowed.

Now, let's collect all position constraints:

For A:
  Cannot be at 2 (from panel) and 3 (from crane) and 5 (from enema).
  Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 4.

For N:
  Cannot be at 3 (from panel) and 4 (from crane) and 2 (from enema).
  Therefore, N must be at position 1 or 5.

For E:
  Cannot be at 5 (from crane) and 4 (from panel) and now also not at 1 (enema) and not at 3 (enema).
  So E must be at position 2? Because that is the only allowed position left? Because positions available: 1,2,3,4,5; we exclude 1,3 (enema), 4 (panel) and 5 (crane) -> so only position 2.

Therefore, E must be at position 2? Because that is the only possible position for E.

But note: we have E(minus) at position 1 and 3 in enema? But that doesn't preclude E from being at position 2? Actually, yes: the feedback says E is in the word but not at 1 and not at 3? So if there is one E? Then it must be at 2? Or if there are two E's? Then we have an issue? Because we already ruled out positions 4 and 5 for E? And positions 1 and 3 are also not allowed? Then position 2 is the only option? But what about duplicates? The secret word has only one E? Or two?

But if there is only one E? Then it must be at position 2? Because all other positions are forbidden.

If there are two E's? Then we have a problem because we don't have enough positions? But let's see: the secret word contains E? And we know it must be somewhere? If there is one E? Then it must be at 2? If there are two E's? Then one could be at 2? And the other? But there is no other position? Because all other positions for E are forbidden? We cannot put E at 1,3,4,5? Then we must have exactly one E? At position 2.

Therefore, we know that E is at position 2? Yes? So the secret word has E in the second position? And only one E? Because if there were two, one would have been placed at an forbidden position? But the feedback only shows E as present but in the wrong positions? It doesn't tell us how many? But if we have two E? Then we must place two? But we cannot? So we assume one E? At position 2.

But note: in enema? We had two E's? And we got two minuses? Meaning both were not in the correct position? But we also know there is an E? So having an E at position 2? Then when we guessed enema, we put E at 1 and 3? Which were both wrong? So we should get minuses? And if E is also present at position 2? Then we already have an E at 2? But we didn't guess E at 2? We guessed enema? So no symbol for E at position 2? That's okay? Because we guessed E at positions 1 and 3? And the E at position 2? Doesn't affect our guess? Because we didn't put a letter there? No? Wait: in enema? We put E at 1, N at 2, E at 3? So at position 2: we put N? So that is a different letter? So E at position 2? Then we had E at 1 and 3? Which are incorrect? So we get minuses? And position 4: we put M? And position 5: A? And we got minuses for A as well.

But we didn't get anything for position 2? Because we put N? And we got a minus for N? Because N is in the word but not at position 2? Which we already know? So that's consistent.

Now, with E fixed at position 2? We assign A and N:

A must be at position 1 or 4.
N must be at position 1 or 5.

Wait? Can they both be at 1? No? Only one letter per position.

Therefore, we must assign:
  Option 1: A at position 4? And N at position 5? Then position 1 and 3 are for the remaining two letters? And position 2 is E? Already set.

  Option 2: A at position 1? And then N can be at position 5? But if A is at 1, then N cannot be at 1? So N must be at 5? Then position 3 and 4 are for remaining letters? Right? Position 2 is E? Position 1: A? Position 5: N? Positions left: 3 and 4.

  Option 3: A at position 1? N at position 5? Also? That's Option2.

  Option 4: A at position 4? N at position 1? Then we have position 3 and 5 to fill.

So three distinct cases:

Case A:
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: E
  Position 5: N
  Then positions 3 and 4: two new letters? Say X and Y.

Case B:
  Position 1: N
  Position 2: E
  Position 4: A
  Then positions 3 and 5: two new letters.

Case C:
  Position 1: ... not A or N? If we do:
  Position 1: N
  Position 2: E
  Position 5: N? But position 5: we put N? But we only have one N? Because N(minus) at position 2? Doesn't say how many? So it could be more? But we don't know? So we don't assume duplicates? Or?

But from N(minus) in previous guesses? We think there is one N? So probably Case B: Position 1: N, 2: E, 4: A? Then positions 3 and 5: two letters.

But Case A is also valid: position 1: A, 2: E, 5: N? Then positions 3 and 4.

And Case D? Only these two? Because if we do A at 1 and N at 5? That's Case A? Or A at 4 and N at 5? Then position 1 is another letter? And position 3? So:

Case D:
  Position 4: A
  Position 2: E
  Position 5: N
  Then positions 1 and 3: two letters.

But note N must be at 1 or 5? So in Case D: we put N at position 5? Which is allowed? And A at 4? Allowed.

So we have three main cases:

Case A: A in 1, E in 2, N in 5? Then the pattern: A E ? ? N

Case B: N in 1, E in 2, A in 4? Then the pattern: N E ? A ?

Case C: E in 2, A in 4, N in 5? Then pattern: ? E ? A N

We must avoid C,R,P,L,M? And we haven't tested other letters? So the new letters must be in the English alphabet? But not in the forbidden list.

We need to form a valid word for each case? Then see which one has words? Or use the fact that we have only six tries? So we make a guess that tests these possibilities.

But we also need to include the two unknown letters? And we have to guess a word that uses the known constraints.

Let's try to form words for each case:

Case A: A E ? ? N
  The word starts with AE and ends with N? With two letters in between.

  Examples: ""aeion""? Not English.
  ""aesin""? Not word.
  ""taken"": T A K E N? But A is at position 2? Not position 1? Here we need A at 1? Then E at 2? And N at 5? With two letters at 3 and 4? So pattern: A E ? ? N? 
    ""aegin""? Not common? ""amber"": A M B E R? Not ... 
    ""agent"": A G E N T? Not A E ... then N? because E at 2? Here E is at 3? So no.

    ""aesne""? Not word.

  How about ""athen""? Not English? 
    Actually, ""aeons"" is not? 
    ""adren"": R disallowed.

  It might be hard.

Case B: N E ? A ?
  Examples: ""never""? N E V E R? R disallowed? And also E at position 4? But we put A at position 4? Then V,E? But E at 3? Then R disallowed? Also, ""never"" has E twice? Not necessarily a problem? But R disallowed.

  ""nerva"": N E R V A? R disallowed? And V and A? At positions? 
    N at1, E at2, R at3, V at4? But we need A at4? So if we put A at4? V? We put A at4? But V at4? Not same? 
    Also A at4? Then the pattern would be N E ? A ? -> so if we have a word like N E X A Y?

  How about ""netra""? But R disallowed? 
    ""newsa""? Not word? 
    ""neala"": N E A L A? But L disallowed? And also positions: we need N at1, E at2, and then A cannot be at3? Because we have A at position 4? So the third letter must be something else? Then A at4? Then fifth? 
    ""neata""? Not English.

  How common: ""neats"": N E A T S? But that's A at position 3? But we need A at position 4? So not.

  ""needs"": N E E D S? If A were at4? But we don't put A at4? Unless? We are forced: we designated position 4 for A? So ""needs"" has E at3 and D at4? So we put D at4? But we need A at4? So inconsistent.

  So it has to be a word with ""ne"" followed by two letters? Then A? Then any letter? Like ""ne? A?""

  Words: ""nebula""? N E B U L A? But L and not A at4? 
    ""nebata"" -> not word.

  Perhaps ""nexus"": N E X U S? But no A? But we must have A? So no.

Case C: ? E ? A N
  Pattern: two letters? Then E? Then any? Then A? Then N? Or specifically: position 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: A, 5: N? So _ E _ A N.

  Example words: ""depart"": D E P A R? But R and disallowed? Also, last letter T? Not N? 
    ""delay"": too short? 
    ""began"": B E G A N? 
      Positions: B at1, E at2, G at3, A at4, N at5? 
      But does it avoid C,R,P,L,M? Yes? G and B? new. 
      And positions meet: 
        A at4? We allowed A at4? Yes? 
        N at5? Allowed? 
        E at2? Must? Yes? 
        Also, the constraints: 
          Crane: N at position 4? We put N at5? So not 4? good. 
          Panel: E at position 4? But we put E at2? not 4? good. 
          Enema: E at position 1 and 3? But we don't have E at1? We have E at2? so this E at2 is correct? But wait: we are guessing E at2? So if the pattern is _ E _ A N? Then ""began"" fits.

  But is that the feedback? We haven't guessed ""began""? But let's see: we know E at2? So if we guess ""began"", we get:
    Position 1: B? If B is in the word? 
    Position 2: E? If E is at2? So we would get a check? 
    Position 3: G? 
    Position 4: A? So we might get a minus? Since A cannot be at4? Wait: why can't A be at4? We said A can be at position 4? Because A cannot be at2,3,5? So only 1 and 4? And we are putting A at4? So that is the only other possibility? So it's fine.

  But let's see: we haven't told that B or G are in the word? We don't know? But we must try.

  Similarly, other words? ""human"": H U M A N? 
    Positions: H at1, U at2, M at3, A at4, N at5? 
    But U at2? But position 2 is E? Must be E? So we cannot have U at2.

  ""began"" has E at2? And A at4? N at5? And we avoid C,R,P,L,M? Yes.

  Also, ""began"" has been used in previous Wordle games? So it is valid.

  Another word: ""woman"": W O M A N? But M is disallowed? Because in enema? M at4 got x? So M not in word? Disallowed.

  ""begin"": B E G I N? Not _ E _ A N? Because it has I and N? Not A.

  How about ""sedan"": S E D A N? 
    Positions: S at1, E at2, D at3, A at4, N at5? 
    Avoid C,R,P,L,M? Yes? S and D? new.

  So ""sedan"" also fits.

  ""weigh"": not ... no A.

  So two options: ""began"" and ""sedan"".

But in both words, E is at position 2? And A at4? N at5.

Also, Case C? We have E at2? So the E must be at2? Because it is fixed? So if we guess ""began"" or ""sedan"", we are covering this case.

But what about Case B? Case B was N E ? A ?? With N at1, E at2, A at4? And we didn't find a word? But what if the word exists?

Example: ""neala"": not word? 
  ""neesa""? Not? 
  ""nevia"": N E V I A? Then at4? We put I? But in the pattern: position 4 must be A? So we put A at4? So unless the word is like ""new a"" but not? 
  How about ""neater"": too long? 
  ""neara"": Not? 
  ""nejati"": no.

So probably no common word? So we focus on Case C.

Now? What about Case A? We haven't found a word for A? But Case A is: A E ? ? N? 
  ""aesip""? Not? 
  ""aetyn""? Not? 
  ""aexit""? Not.

  The only common word I think of: ""aeons""? But that's A E O N S? Then O at3? N at4? But we need the word to end with N? And two letters in between? But ""aeons"" is A E O N S? Then N is at4? Which is forbidden? Because N cannot be at4? From crane? So invalid.

  Also: ""agent"": A G E N T? Then E at3? N at4? And positions? But we said N cannot be at4? This is forbidden.

  Therefore, Case A is unlikely? So Case C is more likely.

Therefore, we guess a word fitting the pattern: _ E _ A N? Avoiding C,R,P,L,M? And the same letter set?

Of course, we have ""began"", ""sedan"", ""rebeg"" not? Or ""defat"" not?

Others: ""detain""? But T not allowed? Position? ""detan"" not? 

But we must avoid M,L,R,P,C? So ""began"": B E G A N? Avoid these.
  ""sedan"": S E D A N? Avoid these.

Also: ""taxed"": T A X E D? Not pattern _ E _ A N? Wrong.

  ""apart"": has A in wrong positions.

We choose between ""began"" and ""sedan"".

Since both are valid? And we are on the fourth guess? We can choose one? And if not? Next guess? But we prefer to guess the word that might give us more info? Or solve? But we might not succeed? So we choose one.

How about we consider the first guess ""crane"" had A and N minuses? But didn't tell positions? And we haven't tested B, G, S, D? Before? So ""began"" tests B and G? ""sedan"" tests S and D? 

But both are good? But we didn't test any B or S? Or D? Or G? 

To maximize information? But we want to solve the puzzle? Since we are limited to 6 guesses? And we have to use 4? So we guess one.

We can also think: if we guess ""began"", and it's not the word, we get feedback? Then we know? Similarly for ""sedan"". But we have two choices? Or more? How about ""pecan""? P disallowed? 

Another: ""tread"": T R E A D? R disallowed? 

So let's go with ""sedan""? Because S and D are common? Or ""began""? 

Wait? We need the word to be accepted? Both are valid English words? And 5 letters? 

Another option: ""weald"": W E A L D? But L disallowed? No? L not allowed? From panel: L(x) disallowed? So cannot.

I'll choose ""began"" as a guess.

But ""began"": 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: E (should be correct? Because we fixed E at2)
  Position 3: G
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: N

So if E is fixed at 2? Then we should get a check for position 2? And for position 5? N? And if A at4 is correct? Also a check? Then we would solve? But we don't know if A at4 is the correct? We only know that A must be at position 4 if it isn't at position 1? But we are not sure? Because Case B? But Case B seems unlikely? So high chance.

Also? What if E at2 is correct? Then position 2 is E? And we have it? Then the whole word might be ""began""? 

So guess ""began"".

Alternatively? We have another constraints? For example? In crane? Position 3 was A? And we got minus? Now we put G at3? If G is new? Then it might be present? Or absent? We don't know.

Similarly? Panel: we had A at2? Minus? And now we have A at4? So if A is at4? We should get a check? Or wait: in this? 

Actually? We are guessing? So let's just guess ""began"".

So next guess: began

Note: but we also have the possibility of Case B? With N E ? A ?? And we haven't found a word? So probably Case C is correct.

So <guess>began</guess>After gathering feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Crane**: Eliminated C, R; confirmed A, N, E are present but misplaced.
- **Panel**: Eliminated P, L; confirmed A, N, E remain misplaced (positions 2, 3, 4 excluded for A, N, E respectively).
- **Enema**: Eliminated M; confirmed:
  - E cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (added to existing constraints).
  - A cannot be in position 5 (added to constraints).
  - All occurrences of E in ""enema"" were misplaced, suggesting E is limited to position 2 (the only remaining valid position).

### Position constraints summary:
- **A**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → must be in position 1 or 4.
- **N**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → must be in position 1 or 5.
- **E**: Cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 → must be in position 2.
- Excluded letters: C, R, P, L, M.

### Deduction:
E is fixed at position 2. All valid word solutions must fit one of these patterns:
1. **A E _ _ N** (A at 1, N at 5)  
2. **N E _ A _** (N at 1, A at 4)  
3. **\_ E _ A N** (A at 4, N at 5)

After testing possible words against the constraints and excluded letters, the pattern **\_ E _ A N** yields the most feasible solution. The word **""began""** fits this pattern perfectly:
- **B** (position 1, new letter)  
- **E** (position 2, correct placement)  
- **G** (position 3, new letter)  
- **A** (position 4, satisfies constraints)  
- **N** (position 5, satisfies constraints)  

""Began"" uses valid English letters, avoids excluded characters (C, R, P, L, M), and adheres to all positional constraints.",Guess 4: began -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) G(✓) A(✓) N(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,5,vegan,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are common letters.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
 C: x (not in the word)
 R: x (not in the word)
 A: - (in the word but wrong position)
 N: - (in the word but wrong position)
 E: - (in the word but wrong position)

 So, we know:
 - The letters C and R are not in the secret word at all.
 - The letters A, N, and E are in the secret word, but not in the positions we guessed.

 Since we know A, N, E are in the word, but not in the positions we had (which were positions 3, 4, 5 respectively in ""crane""), we must place them in other positions.

 Also, note that the secret word does not contain C or R.

 Our next guess should:
 1. Include the letters A, N, E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".
 2. Avoid using C and R.
 3. We can try to use other common letters to get more information.

 In the first guess, we had:
   Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C, and also not R? Actually, we know R is not in the word at all, so the first letter cannot be R either.

 But note: the feedback for R was x, meaning R is not in the word at all. Similarly for C.

 We also know that A, N, E are in the word. So we have at least three letters: A, N, E.

 We need to form a 5-letter word that includes A, N, E and two new letters (avoiding C and R).

 Let's think of positions:
 In ""crane"", the A was in position 3, so in the new word we must not put A in position 3.
 Similarly, N was in position 4, so avoid position 4 for N.
 E was in position 5, so avoid position 5 for E.

 We have to place A, N, E in positions 1,2,3,4,5 but with restrictions:
   A: not in position 3
   N: not in position 4
   E: not in position 5

 Also, we don't know the other two letters. We should try to use common consonants that we haven't tried yet, such as T, S, L, etc.

 Let's try to form a word that meets these criteria.

 One idea: We can try to put A in position 1, but we don't know if that's allowed. However, we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong.

 Example words:
 - We could try ""anode"", but note:
   - A in position 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A)
   - N in position 2 (which is not position 4, okay for N)
   - O is new
   - D is new
   - E in position 5 -> but we cannot put E in position 5 because in the first guess E was at position 5 and we got a '-' meaning it's in the word but not at that position. So we must avoid position 5 for E.

 Therefore, ""anode"" is invalid because E is at position 5.

 Another idea: ""anise""
   A at 1 (okay, not 3)
   N at 2 (okay, not 4)
   I at 3 (new)
   S at 4 (new)
   E at 5 -> again, position 5 for E is not allowed.

 We need to put E not at position 5. How about ""eaten""?
   E at 1 -> but we don't know if E can be at 1? The feedback only said E is in the word but not at position 5. So position 1 is allowed for E.
   A at 2 (not 3, okay)
   T at 3 (new)
   E at 4? Wait, we have two E's? But we don't know if the word has two E's. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. It could be that the word has only one E. However, we don't know.

 But note: the word ""eaten"" has two E's. We don't know if the secret word has two E's. It's possible.

 However, we must avoid using C and R. ""eaten"" doesn't have C or R.

 Let's check the positions for the known letters in ""eaten"":
   E: at position 1 and 4. We know that E is in the word, but we don't know if it appears twice. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn't mean there can't be two. However, the feedback for the first guess would have shown two minuses if there were two E's? Actually, no: in the first guess we only had one E, so we only got one minus. If the word has two E's and we guess one, we only get one minus. But if we guess two E's and the word has two, then we would get two minuses (or one check and one minus, etc).

 So ""eaten"" is a possibility, but let's see if we can avoid double letters for now to get more information.

 Alternatively, how about ""plane""? 
   P, L, A, N, E.
   But note: in ""plane"", 
     A is at position 3 -> but we cannot put A at position 3 (because in the first guess A was at 3 and we got a minus, meaning it's not at 3). So that's invalid.

 How about ""panel""?
   P at 1
   A at 2 (okay, because previously A was at 3, now at 2 is different)
   N at 3 (but wait: in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because the feedback only said N is not at position 4, but it could be at 3.
   E at 4 (previously E was at 5, so position 4 is new and allowed)
   L at 5.

 Also, we are avoiding C and R.

 So ""panel"" seems like a good candidate.

 But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for A, N, E that we already know are wrong.

 In ""panel"":
   A: position 2 (previously was 3 -> okay)
   N: position 3 (previously was 4 -> okay, because we are changing from 4 to 3)
   E: position 4 (previously was 5 -> okay)

 And we introduce two new letters: P and L.

 So let's go with ""panel"".

 However, we must also consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication of that yet.

 Alternatively, we could try ""slant"", but that doesn't have E. We know E is in the word, so we must include E.

 Another word: ""snake"" -> but S at 1, N at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is not allowed (because in first guess A was at 3 and we got a minus). So invalid.

 Another: ""adobe"" -> 
   A at 1 (okay)
   D at 2 (new)
   O at 3 (new)
   B at 4 (new)
   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E was at 5 in first guess and we got minus). So invalid.

 Another: ""inane"" -> 
   I at 1
   N at 2 (okay, not 4)
   A at 3 -> not allowed (A cannot be at 3)
   N at 4 -> but we know N is in the word, but we don't know if it can be at 4? Wait, the feedback for the first guess said N was at 4 and got a minus, meaning it's not at 4. So we cannot put N at 4. Also, we have two N's? We don't know if the word has two N's.

 But in ""inane"", the first N is at position 2 (which is allowed) and the second N is at position 4 (which is not allowed). So we cannot use that.

 After considering, ""panel"" seems a good choice.

 But note: we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

 Let's go with ""panel"".

 However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess also told us that the secret word does not have C or R. So we are safe with P and L.

 So the next guess: ""panel""

 We'll see what feedback we get.

<guess>panel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- **C** and **R** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").
- **A**, **N**, and **E** are present but misplaced (marked ""-""):
  - **A** cannot be in position 3.
  - **N** cannot be in position 4.
  - **E** cannot be in position 5.

For the next guess:
- Must include **A**, **N**, and **E** in new positions.
- Avoid **C** and **R** entirely.
- Introduce new letters to gather more information.

The word **""panel""** fits perfectly:
- **A** is in position 2 (not 3).
- **N** is in position 3 (not 4).
- **E** is in position 4 (not 5).
- New letters **P** and **L** are tested.
- Valid English word, no disallowed letters.

<guess>panel</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for two guesses:

Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Meaning:
  C: not in the word
  R: not in the word
  A: in the word but not in position 3
  N: in the word but not in position 4
  E: in the word but not in position 5

Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)
Meaning:
  P: not in the word
  A: in the word but not in position 2 (because in panel, A is at position 2 and we got a minus)
  N: in the word but not in position 3 (because in panel, N is at position 3 and we got a minus)
  E: in the word but not in position 4 (because in panel, E is at position 4 and we got a minus)
  L: not in the word

So now we know:
- The secret word contains A, N, E (from both guesses, confirmed by minuses).
- The secret word does not contain C, R, P, L.
- We also know the positions where A, N, E cannot be:
  A: cannot be in position 3 (from crane) and cannot be in position 2 (from panel).
  N: cannot be in position 4 (from crane) and cannot be in position 3 (from panel).
  E: cannot be in position 5 (from crane) and cannot be in position 4 (from panel).

We have three confirmed letters: A, N, E.

The secret word is 5 letters and must have two more letters that we haven't tested yet (or possibly we have tested others? We've tested C,R,P,L and they are out).

We used two guesses and have four tries left.

We need to form a word that:
  - Contains A, N, E.
  - Avoids C, R, P, L.
  - Places A not in position 2 or 3.
  - Places N not in position 3 or 4.
  - Places E not in position 4 or 5.

What positions are available for each?
  For A: can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5? (since we have eliminated 2 and 3).
  For N: can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5? (since we have eliminated 3 and 4).
  For E: can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3? (since we have eliminated 4 and 5).

But note: each of A, N, E must appear in the word exactly once? Or could there be duplicates? We don't have information about duplicates because we haven't seen any duplicates in our guesses. However, it's possible that the word has duplicate letters? But we only know at least one A, one N, one E.

We must also introduce two new letters (since we know 3 letters, but not the other two).

Let's list the possible positions for A: 1,4,5
For N: 1,2,5
For E: 1,2,3

But note: the positions must be distinct because we assume one letter per box? Actually, the word might have repeated letters? But if there were repeated letters, we don't have evidence. Also, in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicate letters so far. So we'll assume each letter is unique for now.

We have to assign distinct positions to A, N, E.

Now, we need to form a word that satisfies these constraints and uses two new letters (not C,R,P,L) for the remaining positions.

Consider possible words:

First, assign positions:

Try placing A in position 1: then A at 1.
Then N can be at 2 or 5 (since 1 is taken by A, so 1 is not available for N).
Then E must be at 2,3? But if N is at 2 then E cannot be at 2? Conflict if N is at 2.

Case 1: A at 1.
  Then positions left: 2,3,4,5.
  N must be in {1,2,5} -> but 1 taken, so {2,5}. 
  E must be in {1,2,3} -> 1 taken, so {2,3}.

  So two subcases:

  Subcase 1a: N at 2.
    Then E must be at 3 (since only {2,3} but 2 taken by N).
    Then the word has A at 1, N at 2, E at 3.
    Then positions 4 and 5 must be filled with two new letters (say X and Y).
    Word so far: A N E _ _
    So ""ANE??"". We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""ANE"" and uses letters not in {C,R,P,L} and avoids duplicates? We don't know about duplicates.

    Example words: ""anode"", but O and D? But we must avoid positions? Remember, E is at 3? But we know E cannot be at position 3? No: wait, we have no feedback that E cannot be at 3? Let's see:

    For E: we only know it cannot be at 4 and 5. Position 3 is allowed.

    However, in this structure, the word is ""ANExy"", where x and y are the last two letters.

    Example words: ""anent"" -> but ""anent"" has E at 3? Yes. But note: ""anent"" has two N's? First N at 2, then another N at 4? We need to check.

    ""anent"": A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5? But we have an N at 4, but we know N cannot be in position 4? From first guess crane: N was in position 4 and we got a minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So if we put ""anent"", we are putting N at both 2 and 4? But position 4 is not allowed for N. So we cannot have an N at position 4.

    So ""anent"" is invalid because of the N at position 4.

    Another word: ""anew""? Not 5 letters.

    ""anemia""? Not 5 letters.

    ""anear"" -> but that has R, which is disallowed.

    ""anele"" -> 5 letters? Meaning: to anoint. But note: this has two E's? A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, L at 4? But L is disallowed (because in panel, L was at 5 and we got x, so L is not in the word). Also, E at 5? We cannot put E at 5? Wait: the word is ""anele"": 
      A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, L at 4 (invalid because L not allowed), E at 5 (invalid because E cannot be at 5).

    So cannot use ""anele"".

    Another: ""anise"" -> but S is acceptable? But in ""anise"": 
      A at 1, N at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is not allowed.

    ""antes"": wait, A at 1, then N? No, ""antes"" is A at 1, N at 2? N at 2? Then T at 3, E at 4? But E cannot be at position 4 -> forbidden by panel's feedback.

    In this structure (A at 1, N at 2, E at 3), we need letters for positions 4 and 5. But E at 3 is okay.

    Possible: ""anise"" fails because E must be at 3? But ""anise"" has E at 5? So we need a word that has E at 3? And then two new consonants at 4 and 5.

    What words have the pattern A N E _ _? 
      Examples: ""anent"" is invalid (double N and position 4 forbidden).
                ""anear"" has R -> invalid.
                ""anela"" -> not English.

    Not common. Maybe this placement is difficult.

  Alternatively, in subcase 1a we have A1, N2, E3 and then positions 4 and 5: we can use two new letters. But we need a word. Let me think of ""anent"" being invalid. How about ""aneze""? Not English.

  It might be hard. Let's try subcase 1b: A at 1, N at 5.

    Then E must be at 2 or 3? Since {2,3} available and E cannot be at 4 or 5? 5 taken by N, so only 2 or 3.

    So two possibilities:

      E at 2: then the word is A E ... N? Positions: 1: A, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: N.
        Word pattern: A E ? ? N
        We need a word that starts with ""AE"", which is rare? But let's see.

        Example: ""aeons"": not 5? ""aegis"" has G and S? But S is okay. 
          ""aegis"": A at 1, E at 2, G at 3, I at 4, S at 5. 
          Then we have G and I as new letters? Okay.

        But note: we must avoid C,R,P,L. Also, the letter N is at position 5? Which was forbidden? For N, we said it cannot be at 3 or 4? 5 is allowed.

        And for E at 2: allowed? We only know E cannot be at 4 or 5.

        However, in this word ""aegis"", we don't have the letter N? Wait, we need N! In this placement, we are putting N at 5? So we must use N at 5? Yes.

        So the word is A, E, then two letters, then N: ""aegis"" does not end with N. 

        How about ""aedon""? Not English.

        ""aeons"": A E O N S -> but then N is at position 4? But N cannot be at 4! Forbidden by crane.

        And also, we are putting N at 4? That is disallowed.

        If E is at 2 and N at 5, then the word must be A E X X N. Valid words: ""agent"": A G E N T -> but that's A at 1, G at 2? Wait, no: ""agent"" is A at 1, G at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5. But N at 4 is forbidden.

        ""women"": W O M E N -> not starting with A E.

        This pattern is challenging.

      Or E at 3: then the word is A ? E ? N -> pattern: A _ E _ N
        Examples: ""agent"": A G E N T -> but again, N at 4 is forbidden? Here N is at 5? ""agent"" has N at 4? Not 5.

        ""allen"" but has L -> disallowed.

        ""adren"" but R disallowed.

        ""atone"": A T O N E -> A at 1, T at 2, O at 3, N at 4? N at 4 forbidden -> invalid.

        ""aisne"" -> not English.

        ""ashen"": A S H E N -> A at 1, S at 2, H at 3, E at 4, N at 5? But E cannot be at 4 -> forbidden.

        ""axmen"": not common.

        It seems difficult to find a word with A at 1 and N at 5.

So maybe placing A at 1 is not fruitful. 

Next, place A at 4? Because A can be at 1,4,5. We tried 1. Let's try 4.

Case 2: A at 4.
  Then positions left: 1,2,3,5.
  N can be at 1,2,5 (avoiding 3,4) -> note 4 taken by A, so 1,2,5.
  E can be at 1,2,3 (avoiding 4,5) -> 4 taken, so 1,2,3.

  So we must assign N and E to different positions from {1,2,5} and {1,2,3}.

  Possible assignments:

    If we put E at 3: then N can be at 1,2,5.
      Then the word pattern: for position 4, we have A. Position 3: E.
      So the word looks like: ? ? E A ? 
      But we have N to place: at positions 1,2, or 5.

      If N at 1: then word: N ? E A ? -> ""N?EA?""
        Examples: ""steak"" but S,T,E,A,K -> E is at position 3 and A at 4? Then N at 1? So must start with N? ""N?EA?"" -> like ""nikea""? Not English. ""urea"" is 4 letters.

        ""arena"": A R E N A -> but R not allowed and also A in position 1? We have A at 4? But ""arena"" has A at 1 and 5? And we already have A at 4? So duplicate? But now position 1: A? But we are putting N at 1? No, conflict.

        Actually, we are putting N at 1. So word: N, ?, then E at 3, A at 4, and then the fifth letter. 
        Example: ""niter"": but we don't know the word? ""niter"" is N I T E R? But that doesn't have A? And R is disallowed.

        ""atnea""? Not valid.

    If N at 2: then word: ? N E A ? 
      Examples: ""oneal""? O N E A L? But L is disallowed.

      ""uneaf""? Not common.

      ""inept"": I N E P T? But P is disallowed? And we have E at 3, A at 4, so pattern: ? N E A ? -> so the first letter cannot be I? Actually, if we put in: first letter ?, then N at 2, E at 3, A at 4. Then the fifth letter.

      Possible letters: not C,R,P,L. So let's think of words ending with EA? ... Not many.

    If N at 5: then word: ? ? E A N
      Pattern: ??EAN
      Examples: ""stean""? Not English?
      ""ocean"": O C E A N -> but O is new? But C is disallowed? Yes, C is disallowed -> invalid.

      ""yeast"": Y E A S T -> but E at position 2? We need E at 3? Pattern: first two letters must be such that E is at 3? Then E at 3, A at 4, N at 5: so pattern: ??EAN.

      Words: ""swean""? Not common. ""glean"": G L E A N -> L disallowed? And we have L disallowed.

      ""quean"": Q U E A N -> Q and U? Then Q not forbidden? ""quean"" is valid? But let's see: it avoids C,R,P,L? Yes? But we haven't tested Q and U.

      Similarly, ""spean""? Not common.

      ""dearn""? D E A R N -> R disallowed.

      It might be hard.

  Alternatively, don't put E at 3? If we put E at 1: then word: E at 1, then positions 2 and 3 available for the letters? And then A at 4.

    Then N must be at 1,2,5? But 1 taken by E, so N at 2 or 5.

    So if N at 2: word: E, N, ?, A, ? -> pattern: EN?A?
      Examples: ""entry"": E N T R Y -> R disallowed? Also, R is disallowed.

      ""endow"": E N D O W -> O and W acceptable? But we don't have A? Where is A? We must have A at 4? So the word must be ""ENsomethingA..."" -> but that's ""EN?A?"" meaning fourth letter A? So ""E N ? A ?"".

      ""entia"" is a word? E N T I A -> that is E at 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4, A at 5? But we want A at 4? So that doesn't match.

      We need the fourth letter to be A? So ""entia"" has A at 5.

      How about ""envoy""? No A.

      We need A at position 4? Not at 5.

      ""entra"": but has R.

    Or if N at 5: then word: E ? ? A N -> pattern: E??AN
      Examples: ""again""? A G A I N -> but A at 1? And we have E? Conflict? The word must start with E.

      ""eatan""? Not English.

      ""beman""? Not English.

      But we have to fill with two letters. Example: ""eolian"": too long.

      ""expan"": not word.

So perhaps putting A at 4 is hard too.

Now, place A at 5? Last position.

Case 3: A at 5.
  Then positions left: 1,2,3,4.
  N must be at 1,2,5? But 5 taken, so at 1 or 2? (avoiding 3,4).
  E must be at 1,2,3? (avoiding 4,5).

  And A at 5.

  So assign N and E.

  Possibilities:

    N at 1: then word: N _ _ _ A
        And E must be at 1,2,3? 1 taken, so 2 or 3.
        If E at 2: word: N E ? ? A -> pattern: NE?..A.
        If E at 3: word: N ? E ? A -> pattern: N?E?A.

    N at 2: then word: _ N _ _ A.
        E at 1 or 3? 

Let's try N at 1 and E at 2: then word: N E ? ? A -> ""NE??A""
  Examples: ""never"" -> N E V E R? But R disallowed and also E at position 2 and 4? The second E? Also, the pattern requires last letter A? Not R.

  ""needs"": N E E D S? Last letter S, not A.

  ""neria"": not common.

  ""necza"": not word.

Not easy.

Try N at 1 and E at 3: then word: N ? E ? A -> ""N?E?A""
  Examples: ""noema""? Note O E M A -> but at positions: N at 1, O at 2, E at 3, M at 4, A at 5? E at 3 is allowed.

  And M is a new letter? So ""noema"" might be a word? It's valid? Yes, meaning a thought or concept.

  But does it meet all:
    - Contains A, N, E.
    - Avoids C,R,P,L? O, E, M: yes.
    - Positions:
        A at 5 -> this is the first time A is at 5? We know from crane: A cannot be at 3 -> 5 is allowed. And in this guess, A is at 5 -> allowed? Yes, because we only have restrictions from the minuses: A cannot be at 2 or 3? 5 is okay.
        N at 1 -> allowed? We only know N cannot be at 3 or 4? 1 is okay.
        E at 3 -> allowed (E only cannot be at 4 or 5? 3 is okay).

  Then the letters: O (new) and M (new) are used.

  But we have to make sure that the word ""noema"" doesn't have any disallowed letter? It has O,E,M,A,N: all allowed? Avoid C,R,P,L.

  So ""noema"" is a possibility.

Another example: ""nisei""? S and I? But S and I are new? But then we don't have E? No, it's N at1, I at2, S at3, E? wait no, we require E at3. ""nisei"": N I S E I -> then E is at 4? We need E at position 3? So no.

""noted"": N O T E D -> E is at 4? But E cannot be at 4 -> forbidden.

""named"": N A M E D -> A at 2? Not allowed? A must be at 5? Here A is at 2? Forbidden by previous feedback.

""naveo""? Not English.

""nema"" too short?

""noema"" seems a good candidate.

But is it English? I think noema is an English word? Or a valid variant?

To ensure commonality, try a more common word.

How about ""cause""? But C disallowed.

Another: ""movie""? M O V I E -> doesn't start with N.

Back to N at 2? If we don't use N at 1, we can do:

  If N at 2: then word: ? N ? ? A
  And E must be at 1 or 2 or 3? But 2 taken by N, so 1 or 3.

  So two subcases:

      E at 1: then word: E N ? ? A -> pattern: EN??A

      E at 3: then word: ? N E ? A -> pattern: ?N E?A

  For pattern EN??A: words: ""enter"": not ending with A.
            ""envya"": ENVYA? V,Y,A? but last letter Y? Wait: ""envya"": E,N,V,Y,A -> positions: E at1, N at2, V at3, Y at4, A at5? Yes.

            But we don't have restrictions on V and Y? And we haven't used them? They are new.

            So ""envya"" is a word? I think it might not be standard.

            ""enough"" -> not ending with A.

            ""enema"": E N E M A -> but this has E at 1 and 3? But our pattern has the fifth letter A? Yes: positions: E at1, N at2, E at3, M at4, A at5. But we have two E's? And the feedback so far has only shown distinct versions? It is word.

            Check the positions for existing letters:
              A: at 5 -> allowed? We only forbidden positions 2 and 3 -> allowed.
              N: at 2 -> allowed? We only forbidden positions 3 and 4 -> allowed.
              E: at 1 and 3 -> 
                 E cannot be at 4 or 5? 1 and 3 are allowed? Yes.

            And avoid P,L,R,C: yes.

            So ""enema"" is a valid word: letters E, N, E, M, A.

            We may get an issue with the feedback? Because we have two E's? But that's okay.

  Let's compare with ""noema"". Also, ""enema"" is commonly known.

But in ""enema"", E is at position 1 and 3. And for the letter E, we know it is in the word, but the secret word might have two E's? It's possible.

However, we used ""crane"" and ""panel"", both had one E? So we had minuses for E? But if we guess ""enema"", we might get:

  If the secret word has only one E? Then one of the E's would be marked as not in the word? But we know that the word has at least one E. We don't know whether two E's? However, our feedback and deductions do not rule out two E's.

So let's consider ""enema"" as an option.

But compare with ""noema"": ""noema"" has been recognized as part of the English language? Let's prefer common words.

""enema"" is more common than ""noema"".

But are there other common words? 

Perhaps ""inane""? But we considered earlier and it had problems. Let me recall: ""inane"" is I N A N E -> but A cannot be at position 3? Because crane had A at 3 minus. And in ""inane"", A is at 3? So invalid.

Alternative: ""usage""? But U,S,A,G,E? But A is at 3? not allowed. And we have to include A and E and N? ""usage"" has A,E,N? Actually, ""usage"": U S A G E -> 
  A is at position 3? -> not allowed? And also we don't have N? So invalid.

Another: ""stage""? S T A G E -> A at 3? not allowed.

""agent"": we considered -> N at 4? not allowed.

Given our constraints, we have two candidates: ""noema"" and ""enema"". ""enema"" is a more common word.

So let's propose ""enema"".

But note: we haven't tested for duplicate E? But the feedback will tell us.

Alternatively, we can choose a word with only one E? But we know that we must have at least one E. And we are forced to put E at an allowed position.

Another word: ""taken"": T A K E N -> A at position 2? Not allowed? From panel feedback: A cannot be at 2 -> forbidden. And N is at 5? But T is new? Also, A at2: disallowed.

""baned"": B A N E D -> A at2: disallowed.

 So we go with ""enema"".

However, let's double-check the feedback for ""enema"":
  The secret word contains A, N, E? Yes.
  The positions: 
    E at1: we don't know if that is correct? But we are guessing.
    N at2: okay
    E at3: okay
    M at4: first time testing M
    A at5: okay? But crane also had minuses for A and E? So crane had A at position 3: that is why A cannot be there? Now we are putting A at5: that is different.

So we'll guess ""enema"".

If we do ""enema"", we are using two E's? Not forbidden.

But we have another option: we could try a word with only one E? For example, we haven't tried assigning A at 4 again? Or other possibilities.

But we are limited by time and common words.

After consideration, I choose ""enema"" because it meets all the constraints and is a valid English word.

So next guess: enema

Let's hope it works.

But note: we also haven't tested many new letters. We are testing E again? But in new positions? Also new letters M and not others.

But it's okay.

Alternatively, if we want to use all five positions effectively, we can try to avoid duplication? But it's not necessary.

Let's go.

<guess>enema</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:

- **Crane**: C (x), R (x), A (-), N (-), E (-)  
  → A, N, and E are present but misplaced; C and R are absent.
- **Panel**: P (x), A (-), N (-), E (-), L (x)  
  → A, N, and E remain misplaced; P and L are absent.

### Key insights:
1. **Confirmed letters**: A, N, E are in the secret word.
2. **Absent letters**: C, R, P, L are excluded.
3. **Position constraints**:
   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.
   - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.
   - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.
4. Only positions 1, 4, and 5 are possible for A; positions 1, 2, and 5 for N; and positions 1, 2, and 3 for E.

Given these constraints and the goal to test new letters while including A, N, E, the word **""enema""** fits:
- Positions: E (1), N (2), E (3), M (4), A (5)  
  - A at position 5 (allowed).
  - N at position 2 (allowed).
  - E at positions 1 and 3 (allowed positions; may indicate duplicated E).
- New letters tested: M.
- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, P, L).

<guess>enema</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)
Guess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)
Guess 3: enema -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) E(-) M(x) A(-)

  E(-) at position 1: E is in the word but not at position 1.

Confirmed letters in the word: A, N, E (from all feedback) and no others? Because we have feedback that excludes C,R,P,L,M.

Therefore, the secret word must contain exactly the letters A, N, E, and two additional letters (since we haven't found them yet).

But wait: we know only three letters are confirmed, and we used all three in enema? However, we got minuses for A, N, E in enema? Meaning they are in the word but not in those positions? And we also got two minuses for E? Meaning there might be two E's? But in enema, we had E at 1, N at 2, E at 3, M at 4 (absent), A at 5.

But from the feedback: all occurrences of E got minuses? So E is not at position 1, not at position 3? So E must be in a different position? But the only positions left are 2,4? But wait: position 4 we tried M? But E must be in the word? How many E's are there?

We also know from enema that A is not at 5? So A must be at a position that hasn't been tried? Similarly for N at 2? Not allowed.

Now, let's collect all position constraints:

For A:
  Cannot be at 2 (from panel) and 3 (from crane) and 5 (from enema).
  Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 4.

For N:
  Cannot be at 3 (from panel) and 4 (from crane) and 2 (from enema).
  Therefore, N must be at position 1 or 5.

For E:
  Cannot be at 5 (from crane) and 4 (from panel) and now also not at 1 (enema) and not at 3 (enema).
  So E must be at position 2? Because that is the only allowed position left? Because positions available: 1,2,3,4,5; we exclude 1,3 (enema), 4 (panel) and 5 (crane) -> so only position 2.

Therefore, E must be at position 2? Because that is the only possible position for E.

But note: we have E(minus) at position 1 and 3 in enema? But that doesn't preclude E from being at position 2? Actually, yes: the feedback says E is in the word but not at 1 and not at 3? So if there is one E? Then it must be at 2? Or if there are two E's? Then we have an issue? Because we already ruled out positions 4 and 5 for E? And positions 1 and 3 are also not allowed? Then position 2 is the only option? But what about duplicates? The secret word has only one E? Or two?

But if there is only one E? Then it must be at position 2? Because all other positions are forbidden.

If there are two E's? Then we have a problem because we don't have enough positions? But let's see: the secret word contains E? And we know it must be somewhere? If there is one E? Then it must be at 2? If there are two E's? Then one could be at 2? And the other? But there is no other position? Because all other positions for E are forbidden? We cannot put E at 1,3,4,5? Then we must have exactly one E? At position 2.

Therefore, we know that E is at position 2? Yes? So the secret word has E in the second position? And only one E? Because if there were two, one would have been placed at an forbidden position? But the feedback only shows E as present but in the wrong positions? It doesn't tell us how many? But if we have two E? Then we must place two? But we cannot? So we assume one E? At position 2.

But note: in enema? We had two E's? And we got two minuses? Meaning both were not in the correct position? But we also know there is an E? So having an E at position 2? Then when we guessed enema, we put E at 1 and 3? Which were both wrong? So we should get minuses? And if E is also present at position 2? Then we already have an E at 2? But we didn't guess E at 2? We guessed enema? So no symbol for E at position 2? That's okay? Because we guessed E at positions 1 and 3? And the E at position 2? Doesn't affect our guess? Because we didn't put a letter there? No? Wait: in enema? We put E at 1, N at 2, E at 3? So at position 2: we put N? So that is a different letter? So E at position 2? Then we had E at 1 and 3? Which are incorrect? So we get minuses? And position 4: we put M? And position 5: A? And we got minuses for A as well.

But we didn't get anything for position 2? Because we put N? And we got a minus for N? Because N is in the word but not at position 2? Which we already know? So that's consistent.

Now, with E fixed at position 2? We assign A and N:

A must be at position 1 or 4.
N must be at position 1 or 5.

Wait? Can they both be at 1? No? Only one letter per position.

Therefore, we must assign:
  Option 1: A at position 4? And N at position 5? Then position 1 and 3 are for the remaining two letters? And position 2 is E? Already set.

  Option 2: A at position 1? And then N can be at position 5? But if A is at 1, then N cannot be at 1? So N must be at 5? Then position 3 and 4 are for remaining letters? Right? Position 2 is E? Position 1: A? Position 5: N? Positions left: 3 and 4.

  Option 3: A at position 1? N at position 5? Also? That's Option2.

  Option 4: A at position 4? N at position 1? Then we have position 3 and 5 to fill.

So three distinct cases:

Case A:
  Position 1: A
  Position 2: E
  Position 5: N
  Then positions 3 and 4: two new letters? Say X and Y.

Case B:
  Position 1: N
  Position 2: E
  Position 4: A
  Then positions 3 and 5: two new letters.

Case C:
  Position 1: ... not A or N? If we do:
  Position 1: N
  Position 2: E
  Position 5: N? But position 5: we put N? But we only have one N? Because N(minus) at position 2? Doesn't say how many? So it could be more? But we don't know? So we don't assume duplicates? Or?

But from N(minus) in previous guesses? We think there is one N? So probably Case B: Position 1: N, 2: E, 4: A? Then positions 3 and 5: two letters.

But Case A is also valid: position 1: A, 2: E, 5: N? Then positions 3 and 4.

And Case D? Only these two? Because if we do A at 1 and N at 5? That's Case A? Or A at 4 and N at 5? Then position 1 is another letter? And position 3? So:

Case D:
  Position 4: A
  Position 2: E
  Position 5: N
  Then positions 1 and 3: two letters.

But note N must be at 1 or 5? So in Case D: we put N at position 5? Which is allowed? And A at 4? Allowed.

So we have three main cases:

Case A: A in 1, E in 2, N in 5? Then the pattern: A E ? ? N

Case B: N in 1, E in 2, A in 4? Then the pattern: N E ? A ?

Case C: E in 2, A in 4, N in 5? Then pattern: ? E ? A N

We must avoid C,R,P,L,M? And we haven't tested other letters? So the new letters must be in the English alphabet? But not in the forbidden list.

We need to form a valid word for each case? Then see which one has words? Or use the fact that we have only six tries? So we make a guess that tests these possibilities.

But we also need to include the two unknown letters? And we have to guess a word that uses the known constraints.

Let's try to form words for each case:

Case A: A E ? ? N
  The word starts with AE and ends with N? With two letters in between.

  Examples: ""aeion""? Not English.
  ""aesin""? Not word.
  ""taken"": T A K E N? But A is at position 2? Not position 1? Here we need A at 1? Then E at 2? And N at 5? With two letters at 3 and 4? So pattern: A E ? ? N? 
    ""aegin""? Not common? ""amber"": A M B E R? Not ... 
    ""agent"": A G E N T? Not A E ... then N? because E at 2? Here E is at 3? So no.

    ""aesne""? Not word.

  How about ""athen""? Not English? 
    Actually, ""aeons"" is not? 
    ""adren"": R disallowed.

  It might be hard.

Case B: N E ? A ?
  Examples: ""never""? N E V E R? R disallowed? And also E at position 4? But we put A at position 4? Then V,E? But E at 3? Then R disallowed? Also, ""never"" has E twice? Not necessarily a problem? But R disallowed.

  ""nerva"": N E R V A? R disallowed? And V and A? At positions? 
    N at1, E at2, R at3, V at4? But we need A at4? So if we put A at4? V? We put A at4? But V at4? Not same? 
    Also A at4? Then the pattern would be N E ? A ? -> so if we have a word like N E X A Y?

  How about ""netra""? But R disallowed? 
    ""newsa""? Not word? 
    ""neala"": N E A L A? But L disallowed? And also positions: we need N at1, E at2, and then A cannot be at3? Because we have A at position 4? So the third letter must be something else? Then A at4? Then fifth? 
    ""neata""? Not English.

  How common: ""neats"": N E A T S? But that's A at position 3? But we need A at position 4? So not.

  ""needs"": N E E D S? If A were at4? But we don't put A at4? Unless? We are forced: we designated position 4 for A? So ""needs"" has E at3 and D at4? So we put D at4? But we need A at4? So inconsistent.

  So it has to be a word with ""ne"" followed by two letters? Then A? Then any letter? Like ""ne? A?""

  Words: ""nebula""? N E B U L A? But L and not A at4? 
    ""nebata"" -> not word.

  Perhaps ""nexus"": N E X U S? But no A? But we must have A? So no.

Case C: ? E ? A N
  Pattern: two letters? Then E? Then any? Then A? Then N? Or specifically: position 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: A, 5: N? So _ E _ A N.

  Example words: ""depart"": D E P A R? But R and disallowed? Also, last letter T? Not N? 
    ""delay"": too short? 
    ""began"": B E G A N? 
      Positions: B at1, E at2, G at3, A at4, N at5? 
      But does it avoid C,R,P,L,M? Yes? G and B? new. 
      And positions meet: 
        A at4? We allowed A at4? Yes? 
        N at5? Allowed? 
        E at2? Must? Yes? 
        Also, the constraints: 
          Crane: N at position 4? We put N at5? So not 4? good. 
          Panel: E at position 4? But we put E at2? not 4? good. 
          Enema: E at position 1 and 3? But we don't have E at1? We have E at2? so this E at2 is correct? But wait: we are guessing E at2? So if the pattern is _ E _ A N? Then ""began"" fits.

  But is that the feedback? We haven't guessed ""began""? But let's see: we know E at2? So if we guess ""began"", we get:
    Position 1: B? If B is in the word? 
    Position 2: E? If E is at2? So we would get a check? 
    Position 3: G? 
    Position 4: A? So we might get a minus? Since A cannot be at4? Wait: why can't A be at4? We said A can be at position 4? Because A cannot be at2,3,5? So only 1 and 4? And we are putting A at4? So that is the only other possibility? So it's fine.

  But let's see: we haven't told that B or G are in the word? We don't know? But we must try.

  Similarly, other words? ""human"": H U M A N? 
    Positions: H at1, U at2, M at3, A at4, N at5? 
    But U at2? But position 2 is E? Must be E? So we cannot have U at2.

  ""began"" has E at2? And A at4? N at5? And we avoid C,R,P,L,M? Yes.

  Also, ""began"" has been used in previous Wordle games? So it is valid.

  Another word: ""woman"": W O M A N? But M is disallowed? Because in enema? M at4 got x? So M not in word? Disallowed.

  ""begin"": B E G I N? Not _ E _ A N? Because it has I and N? Not A.

  How about ""sedan"": S E D A N? 
    Positions: S at1, E at2, D at3, A at4, N at5? 
    Avoid C,R,P,L,M? Yes? S and D? new.

  So ""sedan"" also fits.

  ""weigh"": not ... no A.

  So two options: ""began"" and ""sedan"".

But in both words, E is at position 2? And A at4? N at5.

Also, Case C? We have E at2? So the E must be at2? Because it is fixed? So if we guess ""began"" or ""sedan"", we are covering this case.

But what about Case B? Case B was N E ? A ?? With N at1, E at2, A at4? And we didn't find a word? But what if the word exists?

Example: ""neala"": not word? 
  ""neesa""? Not? 
  ""nevia"": N E V I A? Then at4? We put I? But in the pattern: position 4 must be A? So we put A at4? So unless the word is like ""new a"" but not? 
  How about ""neater"": too long? 
  ""neara"": Not? 
  ""nejati"": no.

So probably no common word? So we focus on Case C.

Now? What about Case A? We haven't found a word for A? But Case A is: A E ? ? N? 
  ""aesip""? Not? 
  ""aetyn""? Not? 
  ""aexit""? Not.

  The only common word I think of: ""aeons""? But that's A E O N S? Then O at3? N at4? But we need the word to end with N? And two letters in between? But ""aeons"" is A E O N S? Then N is at4? Which is forbidden? Because N cannot be at4? From crane? So invalid.

  Also: ""agent"": A G E N T? Then E at3? N at4? And positions? But we said N cannot be at4? This is forbidden.

  Therefore, Case A is unlikely? So Case C is more likely.

Therefore, we guess a word fitting the pattern: _ E _ A N? Avoiding C,R,P,L,M? And the same letter set?

Of course, we have ""began"", ""sedan"", ""rebeg"" not? Or ""defat"" not?

Others: ""detain""? But T not allowed? Position? ""detan"" not? 

But we must avoid M,L,R,P,C? So ""began"": B E G A N? Avoid these.
  ""sedan"": S E D A N? Avoid these.

Also: ""taxed"": T A X E D? Not pattern _ E _ A N? Wrong.

  ""apart"": has A in wrong positions.

We choose between ""began"" and ""sedan"".

Since both are valid? And we are on the fourth guess? We can choose one? And if not? Next guess? But we prefer to guess the word that might give us more info? Or solve? But we might not succeed? So we choose one.

How about we consider the first guess ""crane"" had A and N minuses? But didn't tell positions? And we haven't tested B, G, S, D? Before? So ""began"" tests B and G? ""sedan"" tests S and D? 

But both are good? But we didn't test any B or S? Or D? Or G? 

To maximize information? But we want to solve the puzzle? Since we are limited to 6 guesses? And we have to use 4? So we guess one.

We can also think: if we guess ""began"", and it's not the word, we get feedback? Then we know? Similarly for ""sedan"". But we have two choices? Or more? How about ""pecan""? P disallowed? 

Another: ""tread"": T R E A D? R disallowed? 

So let's go with ""sedan""? Because S and D are common? Or ""began""? 

Wait? We need the word to be accepted? Both are valid English words? And 5 letters? 

Another option: ""weald"": W E A L D? But L disallowed? No? L not allowed? From panel: L(x) disallowed? So cannot.

I'll choose ""began"" as a guess.

But ""began"": 
  Position 1: B
  Position 2: E (should be correct? Because we fixed E at2)
  Position 3: G
  Position 4: A
  Position 5: N

So if E is fixed at 2? Then we should get a check for position 2? And for position 5? N? And if A at4 is correct? Also a check? Then we would solve? But we don't know if A at4 is the correct? We only know that A must be at position 4 if it isn't at position 1? But we are not sure? Because Case B? But Case B seems unlikely? So high chance.

Also? What if E at2 is correct? Then position 2 is E? And we have it? Then the whole word might be ""began""? 

So guess ""began"".

Alternatively? We have another constraints? For example? In crane? Position 3 was A? And we got minus? Now we put G at3? If G is new? Then it might be present? Or absent? We don't know.

Similarly? Panel: we had A at2? Minus? And now we have A at4? So if A is at4? We should get a check? Or wait: in this? 

Actually? We are guessing? So let's just guess ""began"".

So next guess: began

Note: but we also have the possibility of Case B? With N E ? A ?? And we haven't found a word? So probably Case C is correct.

So <guess>began</guess>After gathering feedback from all previous guesses:

- **Crane**: Eliminated C, R; confirmed A, N, E are present but misplaced.
- **Panel**: Eliminated P, L; confirmed A, N, E remain misplaced (positions 2, 3, 4 excluded for A, N, E respectively).
- **Enema**: Eliminated M; confirmed:
  - E cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (added to existing constraints).
  - A cannot be in position 5 (added to constraints).
  - All occurrences of E in ""enema"" were misplaced, suggesting E is limited to position 2 (the only remaining valid position).

### Position constraints summary:
- **A**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → must be in position 1 or 4.
- **N**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → must be in position 1 or 5.
- **E**: Cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 → must be in position 2.
- Excluded letters: C, R, P, L, M.

### Deduction:
E is fixed at position 2. All valid word solutions must fit one of these patterns:
1. **A E _ _ N** (A at 1, N at 5)  
2. **N E _ A _** (N at 1, A at 4)  
3. **\_ E _ A N** (A at 4, N at 5)

After testing possible words against the constraints and excluded letters, the pattern **\_ E _ A N** yields the most feasible solution. The word **""began""** fits this pattern perfectly:
- **B** (position 1, new letter)  
- **E** (position 2, correct placement)  
- **G** (position 3, new letter)  
- **A** (position 4, satisfies constraints)  
- **N** (position 5, satisfies constraints)  

""Began"" uses valid English letters, avoids excluded characters (C, R, P, L, M), and adheres to all positional constraints.

Include the letters A, N, E (since they are in the word) but in different positions than in ""crane"".\n 2. Avoid using C and R.\n 3. We can try to use other common letters to get more information.\n\n In the first guess, we had:\n   Position 1: C (x) -> so the first letter is not C, and also not R? Actually, we know R is not in the word at all, so the first letter cannot be R either.\n\n But note: the feedback for R was x, meaning R is not in the word at all. Similarly for C.\n\n We also know that A, N, E are in the word. So we have at least three letters: A, N, E.\n\n We need to form a 5-letter word that includes A, N, E and two new letters (avoiding C and R).\n\n Let\'s think of positions:\n In ""crane"", the A was in position 3, so in the new word we must not put A in position 3.\n Similarly, N was in position 4, so avoid position 4 for N.\n E was in position 5, so avoid position 5 for E.\n\n We have to place A, N, E in positions 1,2,3,4,5 but with restrictions:\n   A: not in position 3\n   N: not in position 4\n   E: not in position 5\n\n Also, we don\'t know the other two letters. We should try to use common consonants that we haven\'t tried yet, such as T, S, L, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to form a word that meets these criteria.\n\n One idea: We can try to put A in position 1, but we don\'t know if that\'s allowed. However, we have to avoid the positions we know are wrong.\n\n Example words:\n - We could try ""anode"", but note:\n   - A in position 1 (which is not position 3, so okay for A)\n   - N in position 2 (which is not position 4, okay for N)\n   - O is new\n   - D is new\n   - E in position 5 -> but we cannot put E in position 5 because in the first guess E was at position 5 and we got a \'-\' meaning it\'s in the word but not at that position. So we must avoid position 5 for E.\n\n Therefore, ""anode"" is invalid because E is at position 5.\n\n Another idea: ""anise""\n   A at 1 (okay, not 3)\n   N at 2 (okay, not 4)\n   I at 3 (new)\n   S at 4 (new)\n   E at 5 -> again, position 5 for E is not allowed.\n\n We need to put E not at position 5. How about ""eaten""?\n   E at 1 -> but we don\'t know if E can be at 1? The feedback only said E is in the word but not at position 5. So position 1 is allowed for E.\n   A at 2 (not 3, okay)\n   T at 3 (new)\n   E at 4? Wait, we have two E\'s? But we don\'t know if the word has two E\'s. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E and it was marked as present but wrong position. It could be that the word has only one E. However, we don\'t know.\n\n But note: the word ""eaten"" has two E\'s. We don\'t know if the secret word has two E\'s. It\'s possible.\n\n However, we must avoid using C and R. ""eaten"" doesn\'t have C or R.\n\n Let\'s check the positions for the known letters in ""eaten"":\n   E: at position 1 and 4. We know that E is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears twice. The feedback for the first guess only showed one E, but that doesn\'t mean there can\'t be two. However, the feedback for the first guess would have shown two minuses if there were two E\'s? Actually, no: in the first guess we only had one E, so we only got one minus. If the word has two E\'s and we guess one, we only get one minus. But if we guess two E\'s and the word has two, then we would get two minuses (or one check and one minus, etc).\n\n So ""eaten"" is a possibility, but let\'s see if we can avoid double letters for now to get more information.\n\n Alternatively, how about ""plane""? \n   P, L, A, N, E.\n   But note: in ""plane"", \n     A is at position 3 -> but we cannot put A at position 3 (because in the first guess A was at 3 and we got a minus, meaning it\'s not at 3). So that\'s invalid.\n\n How about ""panel""?\n   P at 1\n   A at 2 (okay, because previously A was at 3, now at 2 is different)\n   N at 3 (but wait: in the first guess, N was at position 4 and we got a minus. Now we are putting N at position 3. Is that allowed? Yes, because the feedback only said N is not at position 4, but it could be at 3.\n   E at 4 (previously E was at 5, so position 4 is new and allowed)\n   L at 5.\n\n Also, we are avoiding C and R.\n\n So ""panel"" seems like a good candidate.\n\n But note: we have to make sure that we are not repeating the positions for A, N, E that we already know are wrong.\n\n In ""panel"":\n   A: position 2 (previously was 3 -> okay)\n   N: position 3 (previously was 4 -> okay, because we are changing from 4 to 3)\n   E: position 4 (previously was 5 -> okay)\n\n And we introduce two new letters: P and L.\n\n So let\'s go with ""panel"".\n\n However, we must also consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don\'t have any indication of that yet.\n\n Alternatively, we could try ""slant"", but that doesn\'t have E. We know E is in the word, so we must include E.\n\n Another word: ""snake"" -> but S at 1, N at 2, A at 3 -> A at 3 is not allowed (because in first guess A was at 3 and we got a minus). So invalid.\n\n Another: ""adobe"" -> \n   A at 1 (okay)\n   D at 2 (new)\n   O at 3 (new)\n   B at 4 (new)\n   E at 5 -> not allowed (because E was at 5 in first guess and we got minus). So invalid.\n\n Another: ""inane"" -> \n   I at 1\n   N at 2 (okay, not 4)\n   A at 3 -> not allowed (A cannot be at 3)\n   N at 4 -> but we know N is in the word, but we don\'t know if it can be at 4? Wait, the feedback for the first guess said N was at 4 and got a minus, meaning it\'s not at 4. So we cannot put N at 4. Also, we have two N\'s? We don\'t know if the word has two N\'s.\n\n But in ""inane"", the first N is at position 2 (which is allowed) and the second N is at position 4 (which is not allowed). So we cannot use that.\n\n After considering, ""panel"" seems a good choice.\n\n But note: we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.\n\n Let\'s go with ""panel"".\n\n However, we must be cautious: the feedback for the first guess also told us that the secret word does not have C or R. So we are safe with P and L.\n\n So the next guess: ""panel""\n\n We\'ll see what feedback we get.\n\n<guess>panel</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- **C** and **R** are absent from the secret word (marked ""x"").\n- **A**, **N**, and **E** are present but misplaced (marked ""-""):\n  - **A** cannot be in position 3.\n  - **N** cannot be in position 4.\n  - **E** cannot be in position 5.\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include **A**, **N**, and **E** in new positions.\n- Avoid **C** and **R** entirely.\n- Introduce new letters to gather more information.\n\nThe word **""panel""** fits perfectly:\n- **A** is in position 2 (not 3).\n- **N** is in position 3 (not 4).\n- **E** is in position 4 (not 5).\n- New letters **P** and **L** are tested.\n- Valid English word, no disallowed letters.\n\n<guess>panel</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nMeaning:\n  C: not in the word\n  R: not in the word\n  A: in the word but not in position 3\n  N: in the word but not in position 4\n  E: in the word but not in position 5\n\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)\nMeaning:\n  P: not in the word\n  A: in the word but not in position 2 (because in panel, A is at position 2 and we got a minus)\n  N: in the word but not in position 3 (because in panel, N is at position 3 and we got a minus)\n  E: in the word but not in position 4 (because in panel, E is at position 4 and we got a minus)\n  L: not in the word\n\nSo now we know:\n- The secret word contains A, N, E (from both guesses, confirmed by minuses).\n- The secret word does not contain C, R, P, L.\n- We also know the positions where A, N, E cannot be:\n  A: cannot be in position 3 (from crane) and cannot be in position 2 (from panel).\n  N: cannot be in position 4 (from crane) and cannot be in position 3 (from panel).\n  E: cannot be in position 5 (from crane) and cannot be in position 4 (from panel).\n\nWe have three confirmed letters: A, N, E.\n\nThe secret word is 5 letters and must have two more letters that we haven\'t tested yet (or possibly we have tested others? We\'ve tested C,R,P,L and they are out).\n\nWe used two guesses and have four tries left.\n\nWe need to form a word that:\n  - Contains A, N, E.\n  - Avoids C, R, P, L.\n  - Places A not in position 2 or 3.\n  - Places N not in position 3 or 4.\n  - Places E not in position 4 or 5.\n\nWhat positions are available for each?\n  For A: can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5? (since we have eliminated 2 and 3).\n  For N: can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5? (since we have eliminated 3 and 4).\n  For E: can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3? (since we have eliminated 4 and 5).\n\nBut note: each of A, N, E must appear in the word exactly once? Or could there be duplicates? We don\'t have information about duplicates because we haven\'t seen any duplicates in our guesses. However, it\'s possible that the word has duplicate letters? But we only know at least one A, one N, one E.\n\nWe must also introduce two new letters (since we know 3 letters, but not the other two).\n\nLet\'s list the possible positions for A: 1,4,5\nFor N: 1,2,5\nFor E: 1,2,3\n\nBut note: the positions must be distinct because we assume one letter per box? Actually, the word might have repeated letters? But if there were repeated letters, we don\'t have evidence. Also, in our feedback, we haven\'t seen any duplicate letters so far. So we\'ll assume each letter is unique for now.\n\nWe have to assign distinct positions to A, N, E.\n\nNow, we need to form a word that satisfies these constraints and uses two new letters (not C,R,P,L) for the remaining positions.\n\nConsider possible words:\n\nFirst, assign positions:\n\nTry placing A in position 1: then A at 1.\nThen N can be at 2 or 5 (since 1 is taken by A, so 1 is not available for N).\nThen E must be at 2,3? But if N is at 2 then E cannot be at 2? Conflict if N is at 2.\n\nCase 1: A at 1.\n  Then positions left: 2,3,4,5.\n  N must be in {1,2,5} -> but 1 taken, so {2,5}. \n  E must be in {1,2,3} -> 1 taken, so {2,3}.\n\n  So two subcases:\n\n  Subcase 1a: N at 2.\n    Then E must be at 3 (since only {2,3} but 2 taken by N).\n    Then the word has A at 1, N at 2, E at 3.\n    Then positions 4 and 5 must be filled with two new letters (say X and Y).\n    Word so far: A N E _ _\n    So ""ANE??"". We need a 5-letter word that starts with ""ANE"" and uses letters not in {C,R,P,L} and avoids duplicates? We don\'t know about duplicates.\n\n    Example words: ""anode"", but O and D? But we must avoid positions? Remember, E is at 3? But we know E cannot be at position 3? No: wait, we have no feedback that E cannot be at 3? Let\'s see:\n\n    For E: we only know it cannot be at 4 and 5. Position 3 is allowed.\n\n    However, in this structure, the word is ""ANExy"", where x and y are the last two letters.\n\n    Example words: ""anent"" -> but ""anent"" has E at 3? Yes. But note: ""anent"" has two N\'s? First N at 2, then another N at 4? We need to check.\n\n    ""anent"": A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5? But we have an N at 4, but we know N cannot be in position 4? From first guess crane: N was in position 4 and we got a minus, meaning N cannot be at position 4. So if we put ""anent"", we are putting N at both 2 and 4? But position 4 is not allowed for N. So we cannot have an N at position 4.\n\n    So ""anent"" is invalid because of the N at position 4.\n\n    Another word: ""anew""? Not 5 letters.\n\n    ""anemia""? Not 5 letters.\n\n    ""anear"" -> but that has R, which is disallowed.\n\n    ""anele"" -> 5 letters? Meaning: to anoint. But note: this has two E\'s? A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, L at 4? But L is disallowed (because in panel, L was at 5 and we got x, so L is not in the word). Also, E at 5? We cannot put E at 5? Wait: the word is ""anele"": \n      A at 1, N at 2, E at 3, L at 4 (invalid because L not allowed), E at 5 (invalid because E cannot be at 5).\n\n    So cannot use ""anele"".\n\n    Another: ""anise"" -> but S is acceptable? But in ""anise"": \n      A at 1, N at 2, I at 3, S at 4, E at 5 -> E at 5 is not allowed.\n\n    ""antes"": wait, A at 1, then N? No, ""antes"" is A at 1, N at 2? N at 2? Then T at 3, E at 4? But E cannot be at position 4 -> forbidden by panel\'s feedback.\n\n    In this structure (A at 1, N at 2, E at 3), we need letters for positions 4 and 5. But E at 3 is okay.\n\n    Possible: ""anise"" fails because E must be at 3? But ""anise"" has E at 5? So we need a word that has E at 3? And then two new consonants at 4 and 5.\n\n    What words have the pattern A N E _ _? \n      Examples: ""anent"" is invalid (double N and position 4 forbidden).\n                ""anear"" has R -> invalid.\n                ""anela"" -> not English.\n\n    Not common. Maybe this placement is difficult.\n\n  Alternatively, in subcase 1a we have A1, N2, E3 and then positions 4 and 5: we can use two new letters. But we need a word. Let me think of ""anent"" being invalid. How about ""aneze""? Not English.\n\n  It might be hard. Let\'s try subcase 1b: A at 1, N at 5.\n\n    Then E must be at 2 or 3? Since {2,3} available and E cannot be at 4 or 5? 5 taken by N, so only 2 or 3.\n\n    So two possibilities:\n\n      E at 2: then the word is A E ... N? Positions: 1: A, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: ?, 5: N.\n        Word pattern: A E ? ? N\n        We need a word that starts with ""AE"", which is rare? But let\'s see.\n\n        Example: ""aeons"": not 5? ""aegis"" has G and S? But S is okay. \n          ""aegis"": A at 1, E at 2, G at 3, I at 4, S at 5. \n          Then we have G and I as new letters? Okay.\n\n        But note: we must avoid C,R,P,L. Also, the letter N is at position 5? Which was forbidden? For N, we said it cannot be at 3 or 4? 5 is allowed.\n\n        And for E at 2: allowed? We only know E cannot be at 4 or 5.\n\n        However, in this word ""aegis"", we don\'t have the letter N? Wait, we need N! In this placement, we are putting N at 5? So we must use N at 5? Yes.\n\n        So the word is A, E, then two letters, then N: ""aegis"" does not end with N. \n\n        How about ""aedon""? Not English.\n\n        ""aeons"": A E O N S -> but then N is at position 4? But N cannot be at 4! Forbidden by crane.\n\n        And also, we are putting N at 4? That is disallowed.\n\n        If E is at 2 and N at 5, then the word must be A E X X N. Valid words: ""agent"": A G E N T -> but that\'s A at 1, G at 2? Wait, no: ""agent"" is A at 1, G at 2, E at 3, N at 4, T at 5. But N at 4 is forbidden.\n\n        ""women"": W O M E N -> not starting with A E.\n\n        This pattern is challenging.\n\n      Or E at 3: then the word is A ? E ? N -> pattern: A _ E _ N\n        Examples: ""agent"": A G E N T -> but again, N at 4 is forbidden? Here N is at 5? ""agent"" has N at 4? Not 5.\n\n        ""allen"" but has L -> disallowed.\n\n        ""adren"" but R disallowed.\n\n        ""atone"": A T O N E -> A at 1, T at 2, O at 3, N at 4? N at 4 forbidden -> invalid.\n\n        ""aisne"" -> not English.\n\n        ""ashen"": A S H E N -> A at 1, S at 2, H at 3, E at 4, N at 5? But E cannot be at 4 -> forbidden.\n\n        ""axmen"": not common.\n\n        It seems difficult to find a word with A at 1 and N at 5.\n\nSo maybe placing A at 1 is not fruitful. \n\nNext, place A at 4? Because A can be at 1,4,5. We tried 1. Let\'s try 4.\n\nCase 2: A at 4.\n  Then positions left: 1,2,3,5.\n  N can be at 1,2,5 (avoiding 3,4) -> note 4 taken by A, so 1,2,5.\n  E can be at 1,2,3 (avoiding 4,5) -> 4 taken, so 1,2,3.\n\n  So we must assign N and E to different positions from {1,2,5} and {1,2,3}.\n\n  Possible assignments:\n\n    If we put E at 3: then N can be at 1,2,5.\n      Then the word pattern: for position 4, we have A. Position 3: E.\n      So the word looks like: ? ? E A ? \n      But we have N to place: at positions 1,2, or 5.\n\n      If N at 1: then word: N ? E A ? -> ""N?EA?""\n        Examples: ""steak"" but S,T,E,A,K -> E is at position 3 and A at 4? Then N at 1? So must start with N? ""N?EA?"" -> like ""nikea""? Not English. ""urea"" is 4 letters.\n\n        ""arena"": A R E N A -> but R not allowed and also A in position 1? We have A at 4? But ""arena"" has A at 1 and 5? And we already have A at 4? So duplicate? But now position 1: A? But we are putting N at 1? No, conflict.\n\n        Actually, we are putting N at 1. So word: N, ?, then E at 3, A at 4, and then the fifth letter. \n        Example: ""niter"": but we don\'t know the word? ""niter"" is N I T E R? But that doesn\'t have A? And R is disallowed.\n\n        ""atnea""? Not valid.\n\n    If N at 2: then word: ? N E A ? \n      Examples: ""oneal""? O N E A L? But L is disallowed.\n\n      ""uneaf""? Not common.\n\n      ""inept"": I N E P T? But P is disallowed? And we have E at 3, A at 4, so pattern: ? N E A ? -> so the first letter cannot be I? Actually, if we put in: first letter ?, then N at 2, E at 3, A at 4. Then the fifth letter.\n\n      Possible letters: not C,R,P,L. So let\'s think of words ending with EA? ... Not many.\n\n    If N at 5: then word: ? ? E A N\n      Pattern: ??EAN\n      Examples: ""stean""? Not English?\n      ""ocean"": O C E A N -> but O is new? But C is disallowed? Yes, C is disallowed -> invalid.\n\n      ""yeast"": Y E A S T -> but E at position 2? We need E at 3? Pattern: first two letters must be such that E is at 3? Then E at 3, A at 4, N at 5: so pattern: ??EAN.\n\n      Words: ""swean""? Not common. ""glean"": G L E A N -> L disallowed? And we have L disallowed.\n\n      ""quean"": Q U E A N -> Q and U? Then Q not forbidden? ""quean"" is valid? But let\'s see: it avoids C,R,P,L? Yes? But we haven\'t tested Q and U.\n\n      Similarly, ""spean""? Not common.\n\n      ""dearn""? D E A R N -> R disallowed.\n\n      It might be hard.\n\n  Alternatively, don\'t put E at 3? If we put E at 1: then word: E at 1, then positions 2 and 3 available for the letters? And then A at 4.\n\n    Then N must be at 1,2,5? But 1 taken by E, so N at 2 or 5.\n\n    So if N at 2: word: E, N, ?, A, ? -> pattern: EN?A?\n      Examples: ""entry"": E N T R Y -> R disallowed? Also, R is disallowed.\n\n      ""endow"": E N D O W -> O and W acceptable? But we don\'t have A? Where is A? We must have A at 4? So the word must be ""ENsomethingA..."" -> but that\'s ""EN?A?"" meaning fourth letter A? So ""E N ? A ?"".\n\n      ""entia"" is a word? E N T I A -> that is E at 1, N at 2, T at 3, I at 4, A at 5? But we want A at 4? So that doesn\'t match.\n\n      We need the fourth letter to be A? So ""entia"" has A at 5.\n\n      How about ""envoy""? No A.\n\n      We need A at position 4? Not at 5.\n\n      ""entra"": but has R.\n\n    Or if N at 5: then word: E ? ? A N -> pattern: E??AN\n      Examples: ""again""? A G A I N -> but A at 1? And we have E? Conflict? The word must start with E.\n\n      ""eatan""? Not English.\n\n      ""beman""? Not English.\n\n      But we have to fill with two letters. Example: ""eolian"": too long.\n\n      ""expan"": not word.\n\nSo perhaps putting A at 4 is hard too.\n\nNow, place A at 5? Last position.\n\nCase 3: A at 5.\n  Then positions left: 1,2,3,4.\n  N must be at 1,2,5? But 5 taken, so at 1 or 2? (avoiding 3,4).\n  E must be at 1,2,3? (avoiding 4,5).\n\n  And A at 5.\n\n  So assign N and E.\n\n  Possibilities:\n\n    N at 1: then word: N _ _ _ A\n        And E must be at 1,2,3? 1 taken, so 2 or 3.\n        If E at 2: word: N E ? ? A -> pattern: NE?..A.\n        If E at 3: word: N ? E ? A -> pattern: N?E?A.\n\n    N at 2: then word: _ N _ _ A.\n        E at 1 or 3? \n\nLet\'s try N at 1 and E at 2: then word: N E ? ? A -> ""NE??A""\n  Examples: ""never"" -> N E V E R? But R disallowed and also E at position 2 and 4? The second E? Also, the pattern requires last letter A? Not R.\n\n  ""needs"": N E E D S? Last letter S, not A.\n\n  ""neria"": not common.\n\n  ""necza"": not word.\n\nNot easy.\n\nTry N at 1 and E at 3: then word: N ? E ? A -> ""N?E?A""\n  Examples: ""noema""? Note O E M A -> but at positions: N at 1, O at 2, E at 3, M at 4, A at 5? E at 3 is allowed.\n\n  And M is a new letter? So ""noema"" might be a word? It\'s valid? Yes, meaning a thought or concept.\n\n  But does it meet all:\n    - Contains A, N, E.\n    - Avoids C,R,P,L? O, E, M: yes.\n    - Positions:\n        A at 5 -> this is the first time A is at 5? We know from crane: A cannot be at 3 -> 5 is allowed. And in this guess, A is at 5 -> allowed? Yes, because we only have restrictions from the minuses: A cannot be at 2 or 3? 5 is okay.\n        N at 1 -> allowed? We only know N cannot be at 3 or 4? 1 is okay.\n        E at 3 -> allowed (E only cannot be at 4 or 5? 3 is okay).\n\n  Then the letters: O (new) and M (new) are used.\n\n  But we have to make sure that the word ""noema"" doesn\'t have any disallowed letter? It has O,E,M,A,N: all allowed? Avoid C,R,P,L.\n\n  So ""noema"" is a possibility.\n\nAnother example: ""nisei""? S and I? But S and I are new? But then we don\'t have E? No, it\'s N at1, I at2, S at3, E? wait no, we require E at3. ""nisei"": N I S E I -> then E is at 4? We need E at position 3? So no.\n\n""noted"": N O T E D -> E is at 4? But E cannot be at 4 -> forbidden.\n\n""named"": N A M E D -> A at 2? Not allowed? A must be at 5? Here A is at 2? Forbidden by previous feedback.\n\n""naveo""? Not English.\n\n""nema"" too short?\n\n""noema"" seems a good candidate.\n\nBut is it English? I think noema is an English word? Or a valid variant?\n\nTo ensure commonality, try a more common word.\n\nHow about ""cause""? But C disallowed.\n\nAnother: ""movie""? M O V I E -> doesn\'t start with N.\n\nBack to N at 2? If we don\'t use N at 1, we can do:\n\n  If N at 2: then word: ? N ? ? A\n  And E must be at 1 or 2 or 3? But 2 taken by N, so 1 or 3.\n\n  So two subcases:\n\n      E at 1: then word: E N ? ? A -> pattern: EN??A\n\n      E at 3: then word: ? N E ? A -> pattern: ?N E?A\n\n  For pattern EN??A: words: ""enter"": not ending with A.\n            ""envya"": ENVYA? V,Y,A? but last letter Y? Wait: ""envya"": E,N,V,Y,A -> positions: E at1, N at2, V at3, Y at4, A at5? Yes.\n\n            But we don\'t have restrictions on V and Y? And we haven\'t used them? They are new.\n\n            So ""envya"" is a word? I think it might not be standard.\n\n            ""enough"" -> not ending with A.\n\n            ""enema"": E N E M A -> but this has E at 1 and 3? But our pattern has the fifth letter A? Yes: positions: E at1, N at2, E at3, M at4, A at5. But we have two E\'s? And the feedback so far has only shown distinct versions? It is word.\n\n            Check the positions for existing letters:\n              A: at 5 -> allowed? We only forbidden positions 2 and 3 -> allowed.\n              N: at 2 -> allowed? We only forbidden positions 3 and 4 -> allowed.\n              E: at 1 and 3 -> \n                 E cannot be at 4 or 5? 1 and 3 are allowed? Yes.\n\n            And avoid P,L,R,C: yes.\n\n            So ""enema"" is a valid word: letters E, N, E, M, A.\n\n            We may get an issue with the feedback? Because we have two E\'s? But that\'s okay.\n\n  Let\'s compare with ""noema"". Also, ""enema"" is commonly known.\n\nBut in ""enema"", E is at position 1 and 3. And for the letter E, we know it is in the word, but the secret word might have two E\'s? It\'s possible.\n\nHowever, we used ""crane"" and ""panel"", both had one E? So we had minuses for E? But if we guess ""enema"", we might get:\n\n  If the secret word has only one E? Then one of the E\'s would be marked as not in the word? But we know that the word has at least one E. We don\'t know whether two E\'s? However, our feedback and deductions do not rule out two E\'s.\n\nSo let\'s consider ""enema"" as an option.\n\nBut compare with ""noema"": ""noema"" has been recognized as part of the English language? Let\'s prefer common words.\n\n""enema"" is more common than ""noema"".\n\nBut are there other common words? \n\nPerhaps ""inane""? But we considered earlier and it had problems. Let me recall: ""inane"" is I N A N E -> but A cannot be at position 3? Because crane had A at 3 minus. And in ""inane"", A is at 3? So invalid.\n\nAlternative: ""usage""? But U,S,A,G,E? But A is at 3? not allowed. And we have to include A and E and N? ""usage"" has A,E,N? Actually, ""usage"": U S A G E -> \n  A is at position 3? -> not allowed? And also we don\'t have N? So invalid.\n\nAnother: ""stage""? S T A G E -> A at 3? not allowed.\n\n""agent"": we considered -> N at 4? not allowed.\n\nGiven our constraints, we have two candidates: ""noema"" and ""enema"". ""enema"" is a more common word.\n\nSo let\'s propose ""enema"".\n\nBut note: we haven\'t tested for duplicate E? But the feedback will tell us.\n\nAlternatively, we can choose a word with only one E? But we know that we must have at least one E. And we are forced to put E at an allowed position.\n\nAnother word: ""taken"": T A K E N -> A at position 2? Not allowed? From panel feedback: A cannot be at 2 -> forbidden. And N is at 5? But T is new? Also, A at2: disallowed.\n\n""baned"": B A N E D -> A at2: disallowed.\n\n So we go with ""enema"".\n\nHowever, let\'s double-check the feedback for ""enema"":\n  The secret word contains A, N, E? Yes.\n  The positions: \n    E at1: we don\'t know if that is correct? But we are guessing.\n    N at2: okay\n    E at3: okay\n    M at4: first time testing M\n    A at5: okay? But crane also had minuses for A and E? So crane had A at position 3: that is why A cannot be there? Now we are putting A at5: that is different.\n\nSo we\'ll guess ""enema"".\n\nIf we do ""enema"", we are using two E\'s? Not forbidden.\n\nBut we have another option: we could try a word with only one E? For example, we haven\'t tried assigning A at 4 again? Or other possibilities.\n\nBut we are limited by time and common words.\n\nAfter consideration, I choose ""enema"" because it meets all the constraints and is a valid English word.\n\nSo next guess: enema\n\nLet\'s hope it works.\n\nBut note: we also haven\'t tested many new letters. We are testing E again? But in new positions? Also new letters M and not others.\n\nBut it\'s okay.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to use all five positions effectively, we can try to avoid duplication? But it\'s not necessary.\n\nLet\'s go.\n\n<guess>enema</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first two guesses:\n\n- **Crane**: C (x), R (x), A (-), N (-), E (-)  \n  → A, N, and E are present but misplaced; C and R are absent.\n- **Panel**: P (x), A (-), N (-), E (-), L (x)  \n  → A, N, and E remain misplaced; P and L are absent.\n\n### Key insights:\n1. **Confirmed letters**: A, N, E are in the secret word.\n2. **Absent letters**: C, R, P, L are excluded.\n3. **Position constraints**:\n   - A cannot be in positions 2 or 3.\n   - N cannot be in positions 3 or 4.\n   - E cannot be in positions 4 or 5.\n4. Only positions 1, 4, and 5 are possible for A; positions 1, 2, and 5 for N; and positions 1, 2, and 3 for E.\n\nGiven these constraints and the goal to test new letters while including A, N, E, the word **""enema""** fits:\n- Positions: E (1), N (2), E (3), M (4), A (5)  \n  - A at position 5 (allowed).\n  - N at position 2 (allowed).\n  - E at positions 1 and 3 (allowed positions; may indicate duplicated E).\n- New letters tested: M.\n- Avoids forbidden letters (C, R, P, L).\n\n<guess>enema</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: enema -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) E(-) M(x) A(-)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We are given feedback for the third guess ""enema"":\n  E(-) at position 1: E is in the word but not at position 1.\n  N(-) at position 2: N is in the word but not at position 2.\n  E(-) at position 3: E is in the word but not at position 3.\n  M(x) at position 4: M is not in the word.\n  A(-) at position 5: A is in the word but not at position 5.\n\nNow we summarize all we know:\n\nConfirmed letters in the word: A, N, E (from all feedback) and no others? Because we have feedback that excludes C,R,P,L,M.\n\nTherefore, the secret word must contain exactly the letters A, N, E, and two additional letters (since we haven\'t found them yet).\n\nBut wait: we know only three letters are confirmed, and we used all three in enema? However, we got minuses for A, N, E in enema? Meaning they are in the word but not in those positions? And we also got two minuses for E? Meaning there might be two E\'s? But in enema, we had E at 1, N at 2, E at 3, M at 4 (absent), A at 5.\n\nBut from the feedback: all occurrences of E got minuses? So E is not at position 1, not at position 3? So E must be in a different position? But the only positions left are 2,4? But wait: position 4 we tried M? But E must be in the word? How many E\'s are there?\n\nWe also know from enema that A is not at 5? So A must be at a position that hasn\'t been tried? Similarly for N at 2? Not allowed.\n\nNow, let\'s collect all position constraints:\n\nFor A:\n  Cannot be at 2 (from panel) and 3 (from crane) and 5 (from enema).\n  Therefore, A must be at position 1 or 4.\n\nFor N:\n  Cannot be at 3 (from panel) and 4 (from crane) and 2 (from enema).\n  Therefore, N must be at position 1 or 5.\n\nFor E:\n  Cannot be at 5 (from crane) and 4 (from panel) and now also not at 1 (enema) and not at 3 (enema).\n  So E must be at position 2? Because that is the only allowed position left? Because positions available: 1,2,3,4,5; we exclude 1,3 (enema), 4 (panel) and 5 (crane) -> so only position 2.\n\nTherefore, E must be at position 2? Because that is the only possible position for E.\n\nBut note: we have E(minus) at position 1 and 3 in enema? But that doesn\'t preclude E from being at position 2? Actually, yes: the feedback says E is in the word but not at 1 and not at 3? So if there is one E? Then it must be at 2? Or if there are two E\'s? Then we have an issue? Because we already ruled out positions 4 and 5 for E? And positions 1 and 3 are also not allowed? Then position 2 is the only option? But what about duplicates? The secret word has only one E? Or two?\n\nBut if there is only one E? Then it must be at position 2? Because all other positions are forbidden.\n\nIf there are two E\'s? Then we have a problem because we don\'t have enough positions? But let\'s see: the secret word contains E? And we know it must be somewhere? If there is one E? Then it must be at 2? If there are two E\'s? Then one could be at 2? And the other? But there is no other position? Because all other positions for E are forbidden? We cannot put E at 1,3,4,5? Then we must have exactly one E? At position 2.\n\nTherefore, we know that E is at position 2? Yes? So the secret word has E in the second position? And only one E? Because if there were two, one would have been placed at an forbidden position? But the feedback only shows E as present but in the wrong positions? It doesn\'t tell us how many? But if we have two E? Then we must place two? But we cannot? So we assume one E? At position 2.\n\nBut note: in enema? We had two E\'s? And we got two minuses? Meaning both were not in the correct position? But we also know there is an E? So having an E at position 2? Then when we guessed enema, we put E at 1 and 3? Which were both wrong? So we should get minuses? And if E is also present at position 2? Then we already have an E at 2? But we didn\'t guess E at 2? We guessed enema? So no symbol for E at position 2? That\'s okay? Because we guessed E at positions 1 and 3? And the E at position 2? Doesn\'t affect our guess? Because we didn\'t put a letter there? No? Wait: in enema? We put E at 1, N at 2, E at 3? So at position 2: we put N? So that is a different letter? So E at position 2? Then we had E at 1 and 3? Which are incorrect? So we get minuses? And position 4: we put M? And position 5: A? And we got minuses for A as well.\n\nBut we didn\'t get anything for position 2? Because we put N? And we got a minus for N? Because N is in the word but not at position 2? Which we already know? So that\'s consistent.\n\nNow, with E fixed at position 2? We assign A and N:\n\nA must be at position 1 or 4.\nN must be at position 1 or 5.\n\nWait? Can they both be at 1? No? Only one letter per position.\n\nTherefore, we must assign:\n  Option 1: A at position 4? And N at position 5? Then position 1 and 3 are for the remaining two letters? And position 2 is E? Already set.\n\n  Option 2: A at position 1? And then N can be at position 5? But if A is at 1, then N cannot be at 1? So N must be at 5? Then position 3 and 4 are for remaining letters? Right? Position 2 is E? Position 1: A? Position 5: N? Positions left: 3 and 4.\n\n  Option 3: A at position 1? N at position 5? Also? That\'s Option2.\n\n  Option 4: A at position 4? N at position 1? Then we have position 3 and 5 to fill.\n\nSo three distinct cases:\n\nCase A:\n  Position 1: A\n  Position 2: E\n  Position 5: N\n  Then positions 3 and 4: two new letters? Say X and Y.\n\nCase B:\n  Position 1: N\n  Position 2: E\n  Position 4: A\n  Then positions 3 and 5: two new letters.\n\nCase C:\n  Position 1: ... not A or N? If we do:\n  Position 1: N\n  Position 2: E\n  Position 5: N? But position 5: we put N? But we only have one N? Because N(minus) at position 2? Doesn\'t say how many? So it could be more? But we don\'t know? So we don\'t assume duplicates? Or?\n\nBut from N(minus) in previous guesses? We think there is one N? So probably Case B: Position 1: N, 2: E, 4: A? Then positions 3 and 5: two letters.\n\nBut Case A is also valid: position 1: A, 2: E, 5: N? Then positions 3 and 4.\n\nAnd Case D? Only these two? Because if we do A at 1 and N at 5? That\'s Case A? Or A at 4 and N at 5? Then position 1 is another letter? And position 3? So:\n\nCase D:\n  Position 4: A\n  Position 2: E\n  Position 5: N\n  Then positions 1 and 3: two letters.\n\nBut note N must be at 1 or 5? So in Case D: we put N at position 5? Which is allowed? And A at 4? Allowed.\n\nSo we have three main cases:\n\nCase A: A in 1, E in 2, N in 5? Then the pattern: A E ? ? N\n\nCase B: N in 1, E in 2, A in 4? Then the pattern: N E ? A ?\n\nCase C: E in 2, A in 4, N in 5? Then pattern: ? E ? A N\n\nWe must avoid C,R,P,L,M? And we haven\'t tested other letters? So the new letters must be in the English alphabet? But not in the forbidden list.\n\nWe need to form a valid word for each case? Then see which one has words? Or use the fact that we have only six tries? So we make a guess that tests these possibilities.\n\nBut we also need to include the two unknown letters? And we have to guess a word that uses the known constraints.\n\nLet\'s try to form words for each case:\n\nCase A: A E ? ? N\n  The word starts with AE and ends with N? With two letters in between.\n\n  Examples: ""aeion""? Not English.\n  ""aesin""? Not word.\n  ""taken"": T A K E N? But A is at position 2? Not position 1? Here we need A at 1? Then E at 2? And N at 5? With two letters at 3 and 4? So pattern: A E ? ? N? \n    ""aegin""? Not common? ""amber"": A M B E R? Not ... \n    ""agent"": A G E N T? Not A E ... then N? because E at 2? Here E is at 3? So no.\n\n    ""aesne""? Not word.\n\n  How about ""athen""? Not English? \n    Actually, ""aeons"" is not? \n    ""adren"": R disallowed.\n\n  It might be hard.\n\nCase B: N E ? A ?\n  Examples: ""never""? N E V E R? R disallowed? And also E at position 4? But we put A at position 4? Then V,E? But E at 3? Then R disallowed? Also, ""never"" has E twice? Not necessarily a problem? But R disallowed.\n\n  ""nerva"": N E R V A? R disallowed? And V and A? At positions? \n    N at1, E at2, R at3, V at4? But we need A at4? So if we put A at4? V? We put A at4? But V at4? Not same? \n    Also A at4? Then the pattern would be N E ? A ? -> so if we have a word like N E X A Y?\n\n  How about ""netra""? But R disallowed? \n    ""newsa""? Not word? \n    ""neala"": N E A L A? But L disallowed? And also positions: we need N at1, E at2, and then A cannot be at3? Because we have A at position 4? So the third letter must be something else? Then A at4? Then fifth? \n    ""neata""? Not English.\n\n  How common: ""neats"": N E A T S? But that\'s A at position 3? But we need A at position 4? So not.\n\n  ""needs"": N E E D S? If A were at4? But we don\'t put A at4? Unless? We are forced: we designated position 4 for A? So ""needs"" has E at3 and D at4? So we put D at4? But we need A at4? So inconsistent.\n\n  So it has to be a word with ""ne"" followed by two letters? Then A? Then any letter? Like ""ne? A?""\n\n  Words: ""nebula""? N E B U L A? But L and not A at4? \n    ""nebata"" -> not word.\n\n  Perhaps ""nexus"": N E X U S? But no A? But we must have A? So no.\n\nCase C: ? E ? A N\n  Pattern: two letters? Then E? Then any? Then A? Then N? Or specifically: position 1: ?, 2: E, 3: ?, 4: A, 5: N? So _ E _ A N.\n\n  Example words: ""depart"": D E P A R? But R and disallowed? Also, last letter T? Not N? \n    ""delay"": too short? \n    ""began"": B E G A N? \n      Positions: B at1, E at2, G at3, A at4, N at5? \n      But does it avoid C,R,P,L,M? Yes? G and B? new. \n      And positions meet: \n        A at4? We allowed A at4? Yes? \n        N at5? Allowed? \n        E at2? Must? Yes? \n        Also, the constraints: \n          Crane: N at position 4? We put N at5? So not 4? good. \n          Panel: E at position 4? But we put E at2? not 4? good. \n          Enema: E at position 1 and 3? But we don\'t have E at1? We have E at2? so this E at2 is correct? But wait: we are guessing E at2? So if the pattern is _ E _ A N? Then ""began"" fits.\n\n  But is that the feedback? We haven\'t guessed ""began""? But let\'s see: we know E at2? So if we guess ""began"", we get:\n    Position 1: B? If B is in the word? \n    Position 2: E? If E is at2? So we would get a check? \n    Position 3: G? \n    Position 4: A? So we might get a minus? Since A cannot be at4? Wait: why can\'t A be at4? We said A can be at position 4? Because A cannot be at2,3,5? So only 1 and 4? And we are putting A at4? So that is the only other possibility? So it\'s fine.\n\n  But let\'s see: we haven\'t told that B or G are in the word? We don\'t know? But we must try.\n\n  Similarly, other words? ""human"": H U M A N? \n    Positions: H at1, U at2, M at3, A at4, N at5? \n    But U at2? But position 2 is E? Must be E? So we cannot have U at2.\n\n  ""began"" has E at2? And A at4? N at5? And we avoid C,R,P,L,M? Yes.\n\n  Also, ""began"" has been used in previous Wordle games? So it is valid.\n\n  Another word: ""woman"": W O M A N? But M is disallowed? Because in enema? M at4 got x? So M not in word? Disallowed.\n\n  ""begin"": B E G I N? Not _ E _ A N? Because it has I and N? Not A.\n\n  How about ""sedan"": S E D A N? \n    Positions: S at1, E at2, D at3, A at4, N at5? \n    Avoid C,R,P,L,M? Yes? S and D? new.\n\n  So ""sedan"" also fits.\n\n  ""weigh"": not ... no A.\n\n  So two options: ""began"" and ""sedan"".\n\nBut in both words, E is at position 2? And A at4? N at5.\n\nAlso, Case C? We have E at2? So the E must be at2? Because it is fixed? So if we guess ""began"" or ""sedan"", we are covering this case.\n\nBut what about Case B? Case B was N E ? A ?? With N at1, E at2, A at4? And we didn\'t find a word? But what if the word exists?\n\nExample: ""neala"": not word? \n  ""neesa""? Not? \n  ""nevia"": N E V I A? Then at4? We put I? But in the pattern: position 4 must be A? So we put A at4? So unless the word is like ""new a"" but not? \n  How about ""neater"": too long? \n  ""neara"": Not? \n  ""nejati"": no.\n\nSo probably no common word? So we focus on Case C.\n\nNow? What about Case A? We haven\'t found a word for A? But Case A is: A E ? ? N? \n  ""aesip""? Not? \n  ""aetyn""? Not? \n  ""aexit""? Not.\n\n  The only common word I think of: ""aeons""? But that\'s A E O N S? Then O at3? N at4? But we need the word to end with N? And two letters in between? But ""aeons"" is A E O N S? Then N is at4? Which is forbidden? Because N cannot be at4? From crane? So invalid.\n\n  Also: ""agent"": A G E N T? Then E at3? N at4? And positions? But we said N cannot be at4? This is forbidden.\n\n  Therefore, Case A is unlikely? So Case C is more likely.\n\nTherefore, we guess a word fitting the pattern: _ E _ A N? Avoiding C,R,P,L,M? And the same letter set?\n\nOf course, we have ""began"", ""sedan"", ""rebeg"" not? Or ""defat"" not?\n\nOthers: ""detain""? But T not allowed? Position? ""detan"" not? \n\nBut we must avoid M,L,R,P,C? So ""began"": B E G A N? Avoid these.\n  ""sedan"": S E D A N? Avoid these.\n\nAlso: ""taxed"": T A X E D? Not pattern _ E _ A N? Wrong.\n\n  ""apart"": has A in wrong positions.\n\nWe choose between ""began"" and ""sedan"".\n\nSince both are valid? And we are on the fourth guess? We can choose one? And if not? Next guess? But we prefer to guess the word that might give us more info? Or solve? But we might not succeed? So we choose one.\n\nHow about we consider the first guess ""crane"" had A and N minuses? But didn\'t tell positions? And we haven\'t tested B, G, S, D? Before? So ""began"" tests B and G? ""sedan"" tests S and D? \n\nBut both are good? But we didn\'t test any B or S? Or D? Or G? \n\nTo maximize information? But we want to solve the puzzle? Since we are limited to 6 guesses? And we have to use 4? So we guess one.\n\nWe can also think: if we guess ""began"", and it\'s not the word, we get feedback? Then we know? Similarly for ""sedan"". But we have two choices? Or more? How about ""pecan""? P disallowed? \n\nAnother: ""tread"": T R E A D? R disallowed? \n\nSo let\'s go with ""sedan""? Because S and D are common? Or ""began""? \n\nWait? We need the word to be accepted? Both are valid English words? And 5 letters? \n\nAnother option: ""weald"": W E A L D? But L disallowed? No? L not allowed? From panel: L(x) disallowed? So cannot.\n\nI\'ll choose ""began"" as a guess.\n\nBut ""began"": \n  Position 1: B\n  Position 2: E (should be correct? Because we fixed E at2)\n  Position 3: G\n  Position 4: A\n  Position 5: N\n\nSo if E is fixed at 2? Then we should get a check for position 2? And for position 5? N? And if A at4 is correct? Also a check? Then we would solve? But we don\'t know if A at4 is the correct? We only know that A must be at position 4 if it isn\'t at position 1? But we are not sure? Because Case B? But Case B seems unlikely? So high chance.\n\nAlso? What if E at2 is correct? Then position 2 is E? And we have it? Then the whole word might be ""began""? \n\nSo guess ""began"".\n\nAlternatively? We have another constraints? For example? In crane? Position 3 was A? And we got minus? Now we put G at3? If G is new? Then it might be present? Or absent? We don\'t know.\n\nSimilarly? Panel: we had A at2? Minus? And now we have A at4? So if A is at4? We should get a check? Or wait: in this? \n\nActually? We are guessing? So let\'s just guess ""began"".\n\nSo next guess: began\n\nNote: but we also have the possibility of Case B? With N E ? A ?? And we haven\'t found a word? So probably Case C is correct.\n\nSo <guess>began</guess>After gathering feedback from all previous guesses:\n\n- **Crane**: Eliminated C, R; confirmed A, N, E are present but misplaced.\n- **Panel**: Eliminated P, L; confirmed A, N, E remain misplaced (positions 2, 3, 4 excluded for A, N, E respectively).\n- **Enema**: Eliminated M; confirmed:\n  - E cannot be in positions 1 or 3 (added to existing constraints).\n  - A cannot be in position 5 (added to constraints).\n  - All occurrences of E in ""enema"" were misplaced, suggesting E is limited to position 2 (the only remaining valid position).\n\n### Position constraints summary:\n- **A**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 5 → must be in position 1 or 4.\n- **N**: Cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4 → must be in position 1 or 5.\n- **E**: Cannot be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 → must be in position 2.\n- Excluded letters: C, R, P, L, M.\n\n### Deduction:\nE is fixed at position 2.

The word **""began""** fits this pattern perfectly:\n- **B** (position 1, new letter)  \n- **E** (position 2, correct placement)  \n- **G** (position 3, new letter)  \n- **A** (position 4, satisfies constraints)  \n- **N** (position 5, satisfies constraints)  \n\n""Began"" uses valid English letters, avoids excluded characters (C, R, P, L, M), and adheres to all positional constraints.\n\n<guess>began</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(-) N(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: panel -> FEEDBACK: P(x) A(-) N(-) E(-) L(x)\nGuess 3: enema -> FEEDBACK: E(-) N(-) E(-) M(x) A(-)\nGuess 4: began -> FEEDBACK: B(x) E(✓) G(✓) A(✓) N(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback for the fourth guess ""began"":
  B(x) at position 1: B is not in the word.
  E(✓) at position 2: E is in the word and in the correct position.
  G(✓) at position 3: G is in the word and in the correct position.
  A(✓) at position 4: A is in the word and in the correct position.
  N(✓) at position 5: N is in the word and in the correct position.

So the feedback tells us:
  - The secret word has E at position 2, G at position 3, A at position 4, and N at position 5.
  - The letter B is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ E G A N

We only need to find the first letter. It must be a letter that is not B and not in the excluded letters (C, R, P, L, M) from previous guesses.

Excluded letters so far: C, R, P, L, M, B.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for the first position: any letter except B, C, R, P, L, M. And it must form a valid 5-letter word ending with ""EGAN"".

Common words ending with ""egan"":
  - vegan
  - pegan (not common, and P is excluded)
  - megan (but M is excluded)
  - segant? Not 5 letters.

So ""vegan"" is a common word. Let's check the letters:
  V is not excluded? We haven't used V before? And it's not in the excluded list? So V is allowed.

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""vegan"".

But let's confirm:
  Positions: 
    1: V (new, not excluded)
    2: E (correct)
    3: G (correct)
    4: A (correct)
    5: N (correct)

And we avoid all excluded letters.

So we guess ""vegan"".

But note: we have only one guess left? Actually, we are on the fifth guess? But we can solve.

So <guess>vegan</guess>

Based on the feedback from Guess 4 (""began"" → B(x) E(✓) G(✓) A(✓) N(✓)):  
- **E, G, A, N** are confirmed in positions **2, 3, 4, 5** respectively.  
- **B** is absent from the word.  
- The secret word pattern is: `_ E G A N`.  

### Deduction:  
- The first letter must be a valid English letter (not **B**, and not excluded letters **C, R, P, L, M** from prior feedback).  
- The only common 5-letter word fitting `_ E G A N` is **""vegan""**:  
  - **V** (position 1, new letter)  
  - **E** (position 2, correct)  
  - **G** (position 3, correct)  
  - **A** (position 4, correct)  
  - **N** (position 5, correct)  

""Vegan"" satisfies all constraints and uses no excluded letters.

  - The secret word has E at position 2, G at position 3, A at position 4, and N at position 5.
  - The letter B is not in the word.

Therefore, the secret word is of the form: _ E G A N

We only need to find the first letter. It must be a letter that is not B and not in the excluded letters (C, R, P, L, M) from previous guesses.

Excluded letters so far: C, R, P, L, M, B.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible letters for the first position: any letter except B, C, R, P, L, M. And it must form a valid 5-letter word ending with ""EGAN"".

Common words ending with ""egan"":
  - vegan
  - pegan (not common, and P is excluded)
  - megan (but M is excluded)
  - segant? Not 5 letters.

So ""vegan"" is a common word. Let's check the letters:
  V is not excluded? We haven't used V before? And it's not in the excluded list? So V is allowed.

Therefore, the secret word is likely ""vegan"".

But let's confirm:
  Positions: 
    1: V (new, not excluded)
    2: E (correct)
    3: G (correct)
    4: A (correct)
    5: N (correct)

And we avoid all excluded letters.

So we guess ""vegan"".

But note: we have only one guess left? Actually, we are on the fifth guess? But we can solve.

So <guess>vegan</guess>Based on the feedback from Guess 4 (""began"" → B(x) E(✓) G(✓) A(✓) N(✓)):  
- **E, G, A, N** are confirmed in positions **2, 3, 4, 5** respectively.  
- **B** is absent from the word.  
- The secret word pattern is: `_ E G A N`.  

### Deduction:  
- The first letter must be a valid English letter (not **B**, and not excluded letters **C, R, P, L, M** from prior feedback).  
- The only common 5-letter word fitting `_ E G A N` is **""vegan""**:  
  - **V** (position 1, new letter)  
  - **E** (position 2, correct)  
  - **G** (position 3, correct)  
  - **A** (position 4, correct)  
  - **N** (position 5, correct)  

""Vegan"" satisfies all constraints and uses no excluded letters.",Guess 5: vegan -> FEEDBACK: V(✓) E(✓) G(✓) A(✓) N(✓),SUCCESS
