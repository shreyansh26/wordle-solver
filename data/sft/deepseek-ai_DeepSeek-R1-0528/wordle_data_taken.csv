We are making the first guess. Since we have no prior information, we want a word that maximizes the information we can get.
 A good starting word should have common letters and avoid repeating letters to cover more ground.
 Common starting words in Wordle include ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose ""CRANE"" because it has common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and all distinct.

 So, the first guess is ""CRANE"".

We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" -> C(x), R(x), A(-), N(-), E(-)
 Interpretation:
   - C is not in the secret word at all.
   - R is not in the secret word at all.
   - A is in the word but not in the first position (since it was position 1 in ""crane"", but now it's marked as wrong position).
   - N is in the word but not in the fourth position (was position 4 in ""crane"").
   - E is in the word but not in the fifth position (was position 5).

 Therefore, we know:
   - The secret word contains A, N, and E, but not necessarily in the positions we guessed.
   - The secret word does NOT contain C or R.

 We also note that A, N, and E are present, and we need to find their correct positions.

 Since we have three confirmed letters (A, N, E), we should try a word that rearranges these and adds two new letters to test.

 Constraints:
   - The word must not contain C or R (since they are absent).
   - The word must include A, N, E, but not in the positions we had in ""crane"" (since they were marked wrong positions).

 However, note the feedback for A: it was in position 1, but was marked as wrong position. So A cannot be in position 1.
 Similarly, N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.

 Let's think about positions:
   - A was in position 1: so A must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5 in the secret word.
   - N was in position 4: so N must be in one of positions 1,2,3,5 (but note we can't have it in 4).
   - E was in position 5: so E must be in one of positions 1,2,3,4.

 Also, the word is 5 letters.

 Now, we want to make a second guess that:
   - Uses A, N, E in new positions (so that we can narrow down their correct spots).
   - Introduces two new letters to test for presence.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

 Let me try to list some words that have A, N, E and two new letters, and also avoid placing A, N, E in the forbidden positions (i.e., A not in 1, N not in 4, E not in 5).

 Possible words:

 We need to avoid using C and R.

 Let's think about common letters: maybe try S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 Example: ""SANER"" -> but R is disallowed, so skip any word with R or C.

 Another: ""SALINE"" -> 6 letters, too long.

 We need 5 letters: how about ""STANE""? But that may not be a word. Let me think of actual words.

 Possible words: 
   - ""PAINT"" -> but missing E? Must have A, N, E? Actually, it doesn't have E.

 We must have A, N, E.

 Consider ""ANODE"": 
   - Letters: A, N, O, D, E -> includes A, N, E and two new (O, D).
   - Positions: A in 1? But we cannot put A in position 1 because feedback said A is not in position 1. So avoid.

 Consider ""LEANS"": 
   - L, E, A, N, S -> includes E, A, N and new letters L, S.
   - Positions: 
        Position 1: L (new)
        Position 2: E -> note E was previously in position 5 and wrong, so E might be here? We don't know yet.
        Position 3: A -> previously A was in 1, so 3 is different -> okay
        Position 4: N -> but N cannot be in position 4? Previous feedback said N was in position 4 and was marked as wrong position, so we must not put N in 4.
   - So ""LEANS"" has N in position 4 -> not allowed.

 We also cannot put A in position 1, N in position 4, or E in position 5.

 Another word: ""STAIN"" -> has A, N but missing E.

 We need a word that has A, N, E and avoids forbidden positions.

 Let me try ""SNAKE"":
   - S, N, A, K, E -> has N, A, E and new letters S, K.
   - Positions:
        N in position 2 (not 4, okay)
        A in position 3 (not 1, okay)
        E in position 5 -> but feedback said E was in position 5 and was wrong? So we cannot have E in position 5? 
        Therefore, E must not be in position 5 -> skip.

 How about ""MANES"":
   - M, A, N, E, S -> has A, N, E and new M, S.
   - Positions:
        A in position 2 (not 1: okay)
        N in position 3 (not 4: okay)
        E in position 4 (not 5: okay) -> but note E can be in 4 because previous E was in 5 and marked wrong, but position 4 is new.
        And E wasn't in position 4 before? It's a new position so maybe okay.

 So ""MANES"" satisfies the position constraints.

 But note: the secret word has A, N, E and we are using them in positions 2,3,4. However, we are also introducing M and S.

 Alternatively, consider ""ANTE"": only 4 letters.

 How about ""PLANE"":
   - P, L, A, N, E -> includes A, N, E and new P, L.
   - Positions:
        A in position 3 (avoided position 1) -> okay
        N in position 4 -> forbidden! So skip.

 How about ""ALIKE"":
   - Missing N.

 We must have a word with A, N, E in non-forbidden positions.

 Another idea: ""LATEN""? Not a word.

 Consider ""ANENT"": but has two N's? And E is missing? Wait, A, N, E: ""ANENT"" has A and two N's and T, no E.

 Another: ""EATEN"":
   - E, A, T, E, N -> has E and A and N, but note E repeated? Actually, ""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N -> so two E's? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters? However, the feedback doesn't indicate repeated letters? The rules don't mention duplicate letters. In fact, Wordle allows repeated letters? But typically we avoid duplicates initially to maximize information.

 But note: our previous feedback didn't have duplicates. Since we don't know, avoid duplicates if possible.

 ""EATEN"" has two E's? Actually: 
   - First letter E: position 1 -> but we don't have a reason to avoid E at position 1? Because in the first guess E was at position 5 and marked wrong, meaning there is an E somewhere else. It could be at position 1? But note: if E were at position 1, then in the first guess (crane) the E was at the end and was wrong (so that's consistent) but then in the secret word the E at position 1 would cause the feedback for E to possibly be '-' if we guess it again? Actually, the word ""EATEN"" has E twice? So:
   - Let's check: the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know.

 We should avoid repetition for now to maximize information.

 So back to ""MANES"":
   - Letters: M, A, N, E, S -> all distinct? Yes.

 Positions in ""MANES"":
   Position 1: M (new)
   Position 2: A (not 1: okay)
   Position 3: N (not 4: okay)
   Position 4: E (not 5: okay) -> and we are testing E in a new position (since in first guess it was at 5)
   Position 5: S (new)

 This seems acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""SNEAD"" (a name?) or regular words? We want common words.

 Let me try ""LEANS"" again: but we saw N in position 4 is forbidden. So no.

 ""NEAPS""? Meaning: to sail closer to the wind than? Not common.

 ""WEANS""? Meaning: to detach from dependence? Not very common.

 ""MEANS"": 
   - M, E, A, N, S -> same as ""MANES"" but positions: 
        E at position 2 -> then A at 3, N at 4 -> Problem: N at 4 is forbidden! 

 So ""MANES"" is better because it puts N in position 3 (not 4) and E in position 4 (not 5) and A in position 2 (not 1).

 Therefore, let me choose ""MANES"".

 But note: what if the secret word doesn't have M or S? Then we will get feedback that they are absent, which is also information.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses A, N, E but in positions we haven't tried for each? We haven't tried A in 2,3,5? But in ""MANES"" we are trying A in 2. We haven't tried N in 1,2,3,5? Here we try N in 3. We haven't tried E in 1,2,3,4? Here we try in 4.

 So let's go with ""manes"".

After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""C"" and ""R"" are not in the secret word.
- ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are in the word but in incorrect positions (A cannot be position 1, N cannot be position 4, E cannot be position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include A, N, and E in new positions (since their positions were incorrect in ""crane"").
- Avoid using C or R.
- Test new letters to gather more information.
- Chose ""manes"" because it:
  - Places A in position 2 (not position 1).
  - Places N in position 3 (not position 4).
  - Places E in position 4 (not position 5).

 Since we have three confirmed letters (A, N, E), we should try a word that rearranges these and adds two new letters to test.

 Constraints:
   - The word must not contain C or R (since they are absent).
   - The word must include A, N, E, but not in the positions we had in ""crane"" (since they were marked wrong positions).

 However, note the feedback for A: it was in position 1, but was marked as wrong position. So A cannot be in position 1.
 Similarly, N cannot be in position 4 and E cannot be in position 5.

 Let's think about positions:
   - A was in position 1: so A must be in one of positions 2,3,4,5 in the secret word.
   - N was in position 4: so N must be in one of positions 1,2,3,5 (but note we can't have it in 4).
   - E was in position 5: so E must be in one of positions 1,2,3,4.

 Also, the word is 5 letters.

 Now, we want to make a second guess that:
   - Uses A, N, E in new positions (so that we can narrow down their correct spots).
   - Introduces two new letters to test for presence.

 But note: we have 6 tries, so we can afford to test.

 Let me try to list some words that have A, N, E and two new letters, and also avoid placing A, N, E in the forbidden positions (i.e., A not in 1, N not in 4, E not in 5).

 Possible words:

 We need to avoid using C and R.

 Let's think about common letters: maybe try S, T, L, I, O, etc.

 Example: ""SANER"" -> but R is disallowed, so skip any word with R or C.

 Another: ""SALINE"" -> 6 letters, too long.

 We need 5 letters: how about ""STANE""? But that may not be a word. Let me think of actual words.

 Possible words: 
   - ""PAINT"" -> but missing E? Must have A, N, E? Actually, it doesn't have E.

 We must have A, N, E.

 Consider ""ANODE"": 
   - Letters: A, N, O, D, E -> includes A, N, E and two new (O, D).
   - Positions: A in 1? But we cannot put A in position 1 because feedback said A is not in position 1. So avoid.

 Consider ""LEANS"": 
   - L, E, A, N, S -> includes E, A, N and new letters L, S.
   - Positions: 
        Position 1: L (new)
        Position 2: E -> note E was previously in position 5 and wrong, so E might be here? We don't know yet.
        Position 3: A -> previously A was in 1, so 3 is different -> okay
        Position 4: N -> but N cannot be in position 4? Previous feedback said N was in position 4 and was marked as wrong position, so we must not put N in 4.
   - So ""LEANS"" has N in position 4 -> not allowed.

 We also cannot put A in position 1, N in position 4, or E in position 5.

 Another word: ""STAIN"" -> has A, N but missing E.

 We need a word that has A, N, E and avoids forbidden positions.

 Let me try ""SNAKE"":
   - S, N, A, K, E -> has N, A, E and new letters S, K.
   - Positions:
        N in position 2 (not 4, okay)
        A in position 3 (not 1, okay)
        E in position 5 -> but feedback said E was in position 5 and was wrong? So we cannot have E in position 5? 
        Therefore, E must not be in position 5 -> skip.

 How about ""MANES"":
   - M, A, N, E, S -> has A, N, E and new M, S.
   - Positions:
        A in position 2 (not 1: okay)
        N in position 3 (not 4: okay)
        E in position 4 (not 5: okay) -> but note E can be in 4 because previous E was in 5 and marked wrong, but position 4 is new.
        And E wasn't in position 4 before? It's a new position so maybe okay.

 So ""MANES"" satisfies the position constraints.

 But note: the secret word has A, N, E and we are using them in positions 2,3,4. However, we are also introducing M and S.

 Alternatively, consider ""ANTE"": only 4 letters.

 How about ""PLANE"":
   - P, L, A, N, E -> includes A, N, E and new P, L.
   - Positions:
        A in position 3 (avoided position 1) -> okay
        N in position 4 -> forbidden! So skip.

 How about ""ALIKE"":
   - Missing N.

 We must have a word with A, N, E in non-forbidden positions.

 Another idea: ""LATEN""? Not a word.

 Consider ""ANENT"": but has two N's? And E is missing? Wait, A, N, E: ""ANENT"" has A and two N's and T, no E.

 Another: ""EATEN"":
   - E, A, T, E, N -> has E and A and N, but note E repeated? Actually, ""EATEN"": E, A, T, E, N -> so two E's? But we don't know if the word has repeated letters? However, the feedback doesn't indicate repeated letters? The rules don't mention duplicate letters. In fact, Wordle allows repeated letters? But typically we avoid duplicates initially to maximize information.

 But note: our previous feedback didn't have duplicates. Since we don't know, avoid duplicates if possible.

 ""EATEN"" has two E's? Actually: 
   - First letter E: position 1 -> but we don't have a reason to avoid E at position 1? Because in the first guess E was at position 5 and marked wrong, meaning there is an E somewhere else. It could be at position 1? But note: if E were at position 1, then in the first guess (crane) the E was at the end and was wrong (so that's consistent) but then in the secret word the E at position 1 would cause the feedback for E to possibly be '-' if we guess it again? Actually, the word ""EATEN"" has E twice? So:
   - Let's check: the secret word might have repeated letters? We don't know.

 We should avoid repetition for now to maximize information.

 So back to ""MANES"":
   - Letters: M, A, N, E, S -> all distinct? Yes.

 Positions in ""MANES"":
   Position 1: M (new)
   Position 2: A (not 1: okay)
   Position 3: N (not 4: okay)
   Position 4: E (not 5: okay) -> and we are testing E in a new position (since in first guess it was at 5)
   Position 5: S (new)

 This seems acceptable.

 Alternatively, ""SNEAD"" (a name?) or regular words? We want common words.

 Let me try ""LEANS"" again: but we saw N in position 4 is forbidden. So no.

 ""NEAPS""? Meaning: to sail closer to the wind than? Not common.

 ""WEANS""? Meaning: to detach from dependence? Not very common.

 ""MEANS"": 
   - M, E, A, N, S -> same as ""MANES"" but positions: 
        E at position 2 -> then A at 3, N at 4 -> Problem: N at 4 is forbidden! 

 So ""MANES"" is better because it puts N in position 3 (not 4) and E in position 4 (not 5) and A in position 2 (not 1).

 Therefore, let me choose ""MANES"".

 But note: what if the secret word doesn't have M or S? Then we will get feedback that they are absent, which is also information.

 Alternatively, we could choose a word that uses A, N, E but in positions we haven't tried for each? We haven't tried A in 2,3,5? But in ""MANES"" we are trying A in 2. We haven't tried N in 1,2,3,5? Here we try N in 3. We haven't tried E in 1,2,3,4? Here we try in 4.

 So let's go with ""manes"".

<guess>manes</guess>After analyzing the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- ""C"" and ""R"" are not in the secret word.
- ""A"", ""N"", and ""E"" are in the word but in incorrect positions (A cannot be position 1, N cannot be position 4, E cannot be position 5).

For the next guess:
- Must include A, N, and E in new positions (since their positions were incorrect in ""crane"").
- Avoid using C or R.
- Test new letters to gather more information.
- Chose ""manes"" because it:
  - Places A in position 2 (not position 1).
  - Places N in position 3 (not position 4).
  - Places E in position 4 (not position 5).
  - Introduces new letters M and S for testing.
  - Is a valid English word.

We have feedback from the second guess ""manes"": M(x), A(✓), N(-), E(✓), S(x)

Interpretation:
- M is not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3 in the secret word).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- S is not in the secret word at all.

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, M, S
Present letters: A (position 2), E (position 4), and N (somewhere but not position 3 or 4? Note: in ""manes"", N was in position 3 and marked wrong, so N is not in position 3. Also, E is in position 4, so N cannot be there either. Also, from first guess, N was in position 4 and marked wrong, so we already knew N not in 4. Now we also know not in 3.)

Additionally, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 1, but now we know A is fixed in position 2.

Similarly, E is fixed in position 4.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ A _ E _

And it must contain N, which cannot be in position 1 (because if it were in position 1, then in the first guess ""crane"" it was in position 4? Wait, no: in the first guess, N was in position 4 and marked wrong. But now we have more constraints: N cannot be in position 3 (from ""manes"") and cannot be in position 4 (from both). Also, position 2 is taken by A and position 4 by E, so N must be in position 1 or 5.

But note: in the first guess, when we had ""crane"", N was in position 4 and marked wrong. Now we know position 4 is E, so that's consistent. Also, in ""manes"", N was in position 3 and marked wrong, so N is not in 3.

Therefore, N must be in position 1 or 5.

We also have two more letters to find: one in position 1 (if N is not there) and one in position 3, and one in position 5 (if N is not there). Actually, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Positions:
1: unknown (could be N or a new letter)
2: A (fixed)
3: unknown (but cannot be N, and we don't know what else)
4: E (fixed)
5: unknown (could be N or a new letter)

And we know the word contains N, which must be in position 1 or 5.

We also have absent letters: C, R, M, S. So we must avoid these.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We want to test the possibilities for N and also test new letters.

We have two main cases:
Case 1: N is in position 1 -> then the word is N A _ E _
Case 2: N is in position 5 -> then the word is _ A _ E N

We also need to fill position 3 and the other position (if case 1, then position 5 is free; if case 2, position 1 is free).

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we can try to cover both possibilities in one guess? Or we can try to guess a word that helps us distinguish.

We also need to test new letters to find the remaining letters.

List of available letters: we have used C,R,A,N,E,M,S. So absent: C,R,M,S. We have A,N,E present. We need to find two more letters (if N is in position 1, then we need two more; if N is in position 5, we also need two more? Actually, the word has 5 letters: we have A and E fixed, and N must be present, so the remaining two letters are the ones in the unknown positions and one of them might be N? Actually, we have:

- If N is in position 1: then positions 3 and 5 are two new letters.
- If N is in position 5: then positions 1 and 3 are two new letters.

So in either case, we have two new letters to find.

We should try a word that has N in either position 1 or 5, and also tests common letters for the other positions.

But note: we cannot use C,R,M,S.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and use common letters.

First, if we assume N is in position 1, then the word is N A ? E ? 
We need to fill ? in position 3 and 5.

Possible words: 
- NAPES? But S is absent -> invalid.
- NAKED: K and D are new. But D is a common letter? 
- NAMED: M is absent -> invalid.
- NAKES? Not a word.

If N is in position 5, then the word is ? A ? E N
Possible words:
- HAZEN? Not common.
- WAXEN: W and X? 
- BAKEN? Not a word.
- TAKEN: T and K -> T is common, K is common.

""TAKEN"": 
- T in position 1, A in 2, K in 3, E in 4, N in 5.

But note: we don't know if N is in 5. But if we guess ""TAKEN"", then:
- If the secret word is ""TAKEN"", we win.
- Otherwise, we get feedback that tells us about T and K and also about the position of N.

But we must avoid using absent letters: T and K are new and not in the absent list (C,R,M,S). So they are allowed.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that has N in position 1 to test that case.

But we can also try to cover both possibilities? For example, a word that has N in position 1 and then tests common letters for the other positions, but also if the secret word has N in 5, then we will see that N is present but in the wrong position? 

Let me try to find a word that has N in position 1 and uses common letters for 3 and 5, and also avoids absent letters.

For example: ""NAVEL"": 
- N, A, V, E, L -> but E is already fixed in position 4? In ""NAVEL"", E is in position 4? Actually: 
  Position 1: N
  Position 2: A (good)
  Position 3: V
  Position 4: E (good)
  Position 5: L

But note: we are not sure if N is in position 1. Also, we are testing V and L.

But the problem: if the secret word has N in position 5, then in this guess, N would be in position 1 and marked as wrong position? Because if the secret word has N in 5, then position 1 is not N.

So by guessing ""NAVEL"", we can get feedback on N: if N is in the word but not position 1, then we know it must be in 5 (since that's the only other option). And we also test V and L.

Similarly, if we get N marked as correct in position 1, then we know the case.

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication so far.

Another word: ""NADIR"": but R is absent -> invalid.

""NAIAD"": not common, and has multiple A's? But we don't know if A is repeated? But we have A fixed in position 2.

But let's avoid rare words.

Another: ""NAPPY"": but P is new, and Y is new. But we have two P's? Actually, ""NAPPY"" has two P's. We want to avoid repetition? But if we get feedback, it might be okay.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have N in position 1 or 5? But we know N must be in 1 or 5. So if we put N in a different position, it would be wrong and we know it's not there, but we already know it must be in 1 or 5. So that doesn't help.

So we should put N in either 1 or 5 to test.

Let me list possible words for both cases:

Case 1: N in 1 -> word: N A ? E ? 
  We need to fill ? with letters not in {C,R,M,S} and not A,E (but A and E are already placed, so we can use other letters). But note: the word must be a valid English word.

  Possibilities: 
    N in 1, A in 2, then position 3: any letter (not C,R,M,S) and position 5: any letter (not C,R,M,S). And the word must be valid.

  Examples: 
    ""NAIVE"": I and V -> but I and V are new.
    ""NAVEL"": V and L -> as above.
    ""NADIR"": R is absent -> invalid.
    ""NASTY"": S is absent -> invalid.
    ""NAVAL"": V and A? But A is repeated? ""NAVAL"" has two A's? Position 1: N, 2: A, 3: V, 4: A -> but we have E fixed in position 4? So cannot have A in 4. So invalid.

  So ""NAIVE"" and ""NAVEL"" are candidates.

Case 2: N in 5 -> word: ? A ? E N
  Examples:
    ""TAKEN"": T and K
    ""WAKEN"": W and K
    ""BAKEN"": not a word.
    ""HAZEN"": not common.
    ""FAKEN"": not a word.
    ""MAZEN"": not common.
    ""RAVEN"": R absent -> invalid.
    ""PAYEN"": not common.

  So ""TAKEN"" and ""WAKEN"" are candidates.

Now, we can choose a guess that is one of these words? But we don't know which case.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 5 to test that case, and also tests common letters.

But note: we have two fixed letters: A in 2 and E in 4. So we can try ""TAKEN"" as a guess.

If we guess ""TAKEN"":
- If the secret word is ""TAKEN"", we win.
- If not, we get feedback on T, A, K, E, N.

Specifically:
- A and E are fixed and will be correct (✓).
- N is in position 5: if the secret word has N in position 5, then N will be ✓. If the secret word has N in position 1, then N in position 5 will be marked as absent? Or wrong position? 

But note: the secret word has N, but if it is in position 1, then in ""TAKEN"" we have N in position 5, which is not the correct position, so it would be marked as '-'. Also, we would get that T and K are either present or absent.

So by guessing ""TAKEN"", we can distinguish:

- If N is marked ✓ in position 5, then we know the word ends with N, and we have T and K to check.
- If N is marked '-' in position 5, then we know N must be in position 1 (since it's the only other possibility), and then we get feedback on T and K: if they are present or not.

Also, we test T and K.

Similarly, if we guess ""NAVEL"" (with N in 1), we get:
- If N is ✓ in 1, then we know the word starts with N, and we test V and L.
- If N is '-' in 1, then we know N must be in 5, and we test V and L.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can afford to test.

Which one to choose? We can choose a word that uses more common letters.

""TAKEN"" uses T and K, which are common. ""NAVEL"" uses V and L, which are less common.

Also, ""TAKEN"" is a very common word.

But let's see the feedback we got so far: we have A in 2 and E in 4, and N must be in 1 or 5. So the word is either:

  [N or ?] A [ ? ] E [ ? or N]

If we guess ""TAKEN"", we are testing:
  T in 1, A in 2, K in 3, E in 4, N in 5.

If the secret word is ""TAKEN"", we win.

If the secret word has N in 1, then the word is N A ? E ? 
In ""TAKEN"", we have:
  T in 1: but the secret word has N in 1, so T is absent? Or if T is in the word elsewhere? But we don't know. The feedback will be:
  T: if the secret word has T? We don't know. But if the secret word has T, then T might be in another position? But in our guess, T is in 1, so if the secret word has T in, say, position 3, then T would be marked as '-'. But we don't know.

But note: we are trying to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that doesn't commit to one case but tests both? But that's hard.

Another idea: guess a word that has N in position 1 and also tests a common letter for position 5? But we have to fill position 3 as well.

But we don't have to have a real word that fits the pattern? We just need to test.

But we must guess a valid word.

I think ""TAKEN"" is a good choice because it's a common word and it tests the N in 5 case and also tests T and K.

If we get lucky, we win. Otherwise, we get good information.

So let's go with ""TAKEN"".

But note: we must avoid absent letters. T and K are not in {C,R,M,S}, so okay.

Therefore, third guess: ""TAKEN""

<guess>taken</guess>
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: ""crane""** → Feedback: C(absent), R(absent), A(present but wrong position), N(present but wrong position), E(present but wrong position).  
  - This means:  
    - C and R are **not** in the secret word.  
    - A, N, and E **are** in the secret word, but not in positions 1, 4, or 5 (respectively).  

- **Guess 2: ""manes""** → Feedback: M(absent), A(correct position), N(present but wrong position), E(correct position), S(absent).  
  - This means:  
    - M and S are **not** in the secret word.  
    - A is **correctly placed in position 2**.  
    - E is **correctly placed in position 4**.  
    - N is in the word but **not in position 3** (since it was guessed there and marked wrong).  

### Current Knowledge:
- **Secret word pattern**: `_ A _ E _` (positions 2 and 4 are fixed as A and E).  
- **Confirmed present letters**: A, N, E.  
- **Confirmed absent letters**: C, R, M, S.  
- **Constraints for N**:  
  - Cannot be in position 3 (from ""manes"" feedback).  
  - Cannot be in position 4 (from ""crane"" feedback, and position 4 is now fixed as E).  
  - Must be in **position 1 or 5** (only remaining possibilities).  
- **Unknown positions**: 1, 3, and 5 (with N occupying either 1 or 5).  

### Strategy for Next Guess:
- Test the two cases for N (position 1 or 5) while introducing new common letters for the remaining positions.  
- Choose a word that:  
  - Fits the pattern `_ A _ E _`.  
  - Places N in position 5 (to test the ""N in 5"" case, as ""N in 1"" was not tested in previous guesses).  
  - Uses common letters not yet tested (avoiding C, R, M, S).  
- **""taken""** is a strong candidate:  
  - Structure: `T A K E N` (tests N in position 5).  
  - Tests new letters: T (position 1) and K (position 3).  
  - If correct, we win. If not, feedback will:  
    - Confirm if N is in position 5 (✓) or not (-/x, indicating N must be in position 1).  
    - Reveal if T or K are present/absent.  

<guess>taken</guess>",taken,"We have feedback from the second guess ""manes"": M(x), A(✓), N(-), E(✓), S(x)

Interpretation:
- M is not in the secret word at all.
- A is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
- N is in the word but in the wrong position (it was in position 3, so it cannot be in position 3 in the secret word).
- E is in the word and in the correct position (position 4).
- S is not in the secret word at all.

So, from both guesses, we know:

Absent letters: C, R, M, S
Present letters: A (position 2), E (position 4), and N (somewhere but not position 3 or 4? Note: in ""manes"", N was in position 3 and marked wrong, so N is not in position 3. Also, E is in position 4, so N cannot be there either. Also, from first guess, N was in position 4 and marked wrong, so we already knew N not in 4. Now we also know not in 3.)

Additionally, from the first guess, we know A is not in position 1, but now we know A is fixed in position 2.

Similarly, E is fixed in position 4.

Now, the secret word has the form: _ A _ E _

And it must contain N, which cannot be in position 1 (because if it were in position 1, then in the first guess ""crane"" it was in position 4? Wait, no: in the first guess, N was in position 4 and marked wrong. But now we have more constraints: N cannot be in position 3 (from ""manes"") and cannot be in position 4 (from both). Also, position 2 is taken by A and position 4 by E, so N must be in position 1 or 5.

But note: in the first guess, when we had ""crane"", N was in position 4 and marked wrong. Now we know position 4 is E, so that's consistent. Also, in ""manes"", N was in position 3 and marked wrong, so N is not in 3.

Therefore, N must be in position 1 or 5.

We also have two more letters to find: one in position 1 (if N is not there) and one in position 3, and one in position 5 (if N is not there). Actually, the word has 5 positions: 1,2,3,4,5.

Positions:
1: unknown (could be N or a new letter)
2: A (fixed)
3: unknown (but cannot be N, and we don't know what else)
4: E (fixed)
5: unknown (could be N or a new letter)

And we know the word contains N, which must be in position 1 or 5.

We also have absent letters: C, R, M, S. So we must avoid these.

Now, we need to make a third guess. We want to test the possibilities for N and also test new letters.

We have two main cases:
Case 1: N is in position 1 -> then the word is N A _ E _
Case 2: N is in position 5 -> then the word is _ A _ E N

We also need to fill position 3 and the other position (if case 1, then position 5 is free; if case 2, position 1 is free).

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we can try to cover both possibilities in one guess? Or we can try to guess a word that helps us distinguish.

We also need to test new letters to find the remaining letters.

List of available letters: we have used C,R,A,N,E,M,S. So absent: C,R,M,S. We have A,N,E present. We need to find two more letters (if N is in position 1, then we need two more; if N is in position 5, we also need two more? Actually, the word has 5 letters: we have A and E fixed, and N must be present, so the remaining two letters are the ones in the unknown positions and one of them might be N? Actually, we have:

- If N is in position 1: then positions 3 and 5 are two new letters.
- If N is in position 5: then positions 1 and 3 are two new letters.

So in either case, we have two new letters to find.

We should try a word that has N in either position 1 or 5, and also tests common letters for the other positions.

But note: we cannot use C,R,M,S.

Let me think of words that fit the pattern and use common letters.

First, if we assume N is in position 1, then the word is N A ? E ? 
We need to fill ? in position 3 and 5.

Possible words: 
- NAPES? But S is absent -> invalid.
- NAKED: K and D are new. But D is a common letter? 
- NAMED: M is absent -> invalid.
- NAKES? Not a word.

If N is in position 5, then the word is ? A ? E N
Possible words:
- HAZEN? Not common.
- WAXEN: W and X? 
- BAKEN? Not a word.
- TAKEN: T and K -> T is common, K is common.

""TAKEN"": 
- T in position 1, A in 2, K in 3, E in 4, N in 5.

But note: we don't know if N is in 5. But if we guess ""TAKEN"", then:
- If the secret word is ""TAKEN"", we win.
- Otherwise, we get feedback that tells us about T and K and also about the position of N.

But we must avoid using absent letters: T and K are new and not in the absent list (C,R,M,S). So they are allowed.

Alternatively, we could guess a word that has N in position 1 to test that case.

But we can also try to cover both possibilities? For example, a word that has N in position 1 and then tests common letters for the other positions, but also if the secret word has N in 5, then we will see that N is present but in the wrong position? 

Let me try to find a word that has N in position 1 and uses common letters for 3 and 5, and also avoids absent letters.

For example: ""NAVEL"": 
- N, A, V, E, L -> but E is already fixed in position 4? In ""NAVEL"", E is in position 4? Actually: 
  Position 1: N
  Position 2: A (good)
  Position 3: V
  Position 4: E (good)
  Position 5: L

But note: we are not sure if N is in position 1. Also, we are testing V and L.

But the problem: if the secret word has N in position 5, then in this guess, N would be in position 1 and marked as wrong position? Because if the secret word has N in 5, then position 1 is not N.

So by guessing ""NAVEL"", we can get feedback on N: if N is in the word but not position 1, then we know it must be in 5 (since that's the only other option). And we also test V and L.

Similarly, if we get N marked as correct in position 1, then we know the case.

But note: we also have to consider that the secret word might have repeated letters? But we don't have any indication so far.

Another word: ""NADIR"": but R is absent -> invalid.

""NAIAD"": not common, and has multiple A's? But we don't know if A is repeated? But we have A fixed in position 2.

But let's avoid rare words.

Another: ""NAPPY"": but P is new, and Y is new. But we have two P's? Actually, ""NAPPY"" has two P's. We want to avoid repetition? But if we get feedback, it might be okay.

But note: we have only 6 tries, so we want to maximize information.

Alternatively, we can try a word that doesn't have N in position 1 or 5? But we know N must be in 1 or 5. So if we put N in a different position, it would be wrong and we know it's not there, but we already know it must be in 1 or 5. So that doesn't help.

So we should put N in either 1 or 5 to test.

Let me list possible words for both cases:

Case 1: N in 1 -> word: N A ? E ? 
  We need to fill ? with letters not in {C,R,M,S} and not A,E (but A and E are already placed, so we can use other letters). But note: the word must be a valid English word.

  Possibilities: 
    N in 1, A in 2, then position 3: any letter (not C,R,M,S) and position 5: any letter (not C,R,M,S). And the word must be valid.

  Examples: 
    ""NAIVE"": I and V -> but I and V are new.
    ""NAVEL"": V and L -> as above.
    ""NADIR"": R is absent -> invalid.
    ""NASTY"": S is absent -> invalid.
    ""NAVAL"": V and A? But A is repeated? ""NAVAL"" has two A's? Position 1: N, 2: A, 3: V, 4: A -> but we have E fixed in position 4? So cannot have A in 4. So invalid.

  So ""NAIVE"" and ""NAVEL"" are candidates.

Case 2: N in 5 -> word: ? A ? E N
  Examples:
    ""TAKEN"": T and K
    ""WAKEN"": W and K
    ""BAKEN"": not a word.
    ""HAZEN"": not common.
    ""FAKEN"": not a word.
    ""MAZEN"": not common.
    ""RAVEN"": R absent -> invalid.
    ""PAYEN"": not common.

  So ""TAKEN"" and ""WAKEN"" are candidates.

Now, we can choose a guess that is one of these words? But we don't know which case.

Alternatively, we can choose a word that has N in position 5 to test that case, and also tests common letters.

But note: we have two fixed letters: A in 2 and E in 4. So we can try ""TAKEN"" as a guess.

If we guess ""TAKEN"":
- If the secret word is ""TAKEN"", we win.
- If not, we get feedback on T, A, K, E, N.

Specifically:
- A and E are fixed and will be correct (✓).
- N is in position 5: if the secret word has N in position 5, then N will be ✓. If the secret word has N in position 1, then N in position 5 will be marked as absent? Or wrong position? 

But note: the secret word has N, but if it is in position 1, then in ""TAKEN"" we have N in position 5, which is not the correct position, so it would be marked as '-'. Also, we would get that T and K are either present or absent.

So by guessing ""TAKEN"", we can distinguish:

- If N is marked ✓ in position 5, then we know the word ends with N, and we have T and K to check.
- If N is marked '-' in position 5, then we know N must be in position 1 (since it's the only other possibility), and then we get feedback on T and K: if they are present or not.

Also, we test T and K.

Similarly, if we guess ""NAVEL"" (with N in 1), we get:
- If N is ✓ in 1, then we know the word starts with N, and we test V and L.
- If N is '-' in 1, then we know N must be in 5, and we test V and L.

But note: we have only 6 tries, and we are on the third guess. We can afford to test.

Which one to choose? We can choose a word that uses more common letters.

""TAKEN"" uses T and K, which are common. ""NAVEL"" uses V and L, which are less common.

Also, ""TAKEN"" is a very common word.

But let's see the feedback we got so far: we have A in 2 and E in 4, and N must be in 1 or 5. So the word is either:

  [N or ?] A [ ? ] E [ ? or N]

If we guess ""TAKEN"", we are testing:
  T in 1, A in 2, K in 3, E in 4, N in 5.

If the secret word is ""TAKEN"", we win.

If the secret word has N in 1, then the word is N A ? E ? 
In ""TAKEN"", we have:
  T in 1: but the secret word has N in 1, so T is absent? Or if T is in the word elsewhere? But we don't know. The feedback will be:
  T: if the secret word has T? We don't know. But if the secret word has T, then T might be in another position? But in our guess, T is in 1, so if the secret word has T in, say, position 3, then T would be marked as '-'. But we don't know.
