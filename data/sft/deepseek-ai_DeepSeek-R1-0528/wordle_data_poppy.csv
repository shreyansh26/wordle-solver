We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in all letters marked with 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid these letters entirely in our next guess.

 Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.
 Let's think about other common vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels remaining: O, U, I (and sometimes Y)
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but I is a vowel, and Y can be both)

 Since A and E are out, we should focus on O and U for vowels, and common consonants like S, T, L, etc.

 A good second guess might include other high-frequency letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's consider words with letters like S, T, L, O, U, P, M, H, etc.

 Possible words:
 - ""TOILS"" but that has I and S, but let's see if we can find one without the excluded letters.

 Alternatively, let's try ""SPOUT"":
   S, P, O, U, T -> none of C, R, A, N, E.

 But we want to maximize new information. Another common word might be ""GHOUL"", but it has G, H, O, U, L.

 However, a word that covers more common letters: ""MOUTH"" has M, O, U, T, H.

 But let's think of words that might have letters like S, L, T, O, U.

 After excluding C, R, A, N, E, the most common letters in English are S, T, L, O, etc.

 We can use a word like ""SOUPY"" but Y might be less common.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" has P, I, O, U, S.

 But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Let me list a few options:
 1. ""SPLIT"" - S, P, L, I, T -> no C,R,A,N,E.
 2. ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T -> same.
 3. ""BUOYS"" - B, U, O, Y, S -> but Y is less common.
 4. ""GHOUL"" - G, H, O, U, L -> includes U and O.

 Considering coverage, ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has M, O, I, S, T.

 But note that in the previous feedback we know nothing about the secret word. We need to maximize the chance of hitting some letters.

 Since the secret word has no C, R, A, N, E, it must be composed of letters from the remaining set.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice for the second guess.

 Alternatively, ""PYLON"" has Y (which is not excluded) and N is excluded? Wait no, N was in the first guess and we got x for N, so N is out. PYLON has N, which is excluded. So invalid.

 Another option: ""LOUTS"" - L, O, U, T, S -> no excluded letters.

 Or ""TULIP"" - T, U, L, I, P.

 However, I recall that ""SLIPT"" is not a common word, so ""SPLIT"" is better.

 Another popular one: ""FUDGY"" but Y is less common and we might avoid it.

 Perhaps ""HOIST"" has H, O, I, S, T.

 I think ""HOIST"" or ""MOIST"" are both good. Let's choose ""HOIST"".

 But note: we haven't tested H, O, I, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"" is a word: S, H, O, U, T.

 We want to include U? It might be less common than I. But U appears in many words.

 After excluding C, R, A, N, E, the frequency order might change.

 Considering standard English letter frequency after removing C, R, A, N, E:

 Remaining letters by frequency in English: 
 S, T, L, O, M, U, P, D, G, H, I, B, Y, F, V, K, W, X, Z, J, Q.

 So we want to cover the top remaining: S, T, L, O, M, U, P, etc.

 Let's try to include S, T, L, O, U? But in a 5-letter word, it's hard to get all.

 We can choose:

 Option 1: ""SLOUT"" -> but ""SLOUT"" might not be a valid word? Actually, ""LOUTS"" is valid.

 Option 2: ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S -> covers S, P, O, U, I. I is a vowel and might be useful.

 But note that we don't have L or T in that.

 How about ""STOMP""? S, T, O, M, P. This has S, T, O, M, P, which are all high-frequency.

 But we don't have U or I? It's okay because we are trying to get more common letters.

 However, ""STOMP"" is valid.

 But note: we must avoid E, A, N, R, C. STOMP: S, T, O, M, P -> none of the excluded.

 So I think ""STOMP"" is a good choice.

 Alternatively, ""SPOUT"" is also valid: S, P, O, U, T.

 Which one? ""STOMP"" avoids U and uses M which is common. ""SPOUT"" gives us U.

 Since we have no information, and U is the 6th most common vowel after A, E, I, O (and A,E are excluded), we might consider U.

 But M is more common than U? In fact, in standard frequency, M is more common than U.

 Let me check (approximate frequencies):
 - T: 9.1, S: 6.5, L: 4.0, O: 7.5, M: 2.4, U: 2.8 -> U is slightly more common than M? Actually, U is more common than M: wait, according to standard frequencies:

 Order: T (9%), A (8%), S (6%), H (6%), I (5%) ... then O (5%), M (3%), U (3%), ... 

 But we removed A and E? Then after A and E are removed, the next vowels are I and O, then U. 

 Since we have to avoid A and E, words without I or U might be possible? But we don't know.

 Given that, we choose a word that covers multiple high-frequency letters.

 I think ""SPOUT"" has S, P, O, U, T -> very high frequency letters: T, S, O, U, and P is also common.

 Alternatively, ""STOMP"" has S, T, O, M, P -> but M might be less common than U? Actually U is about 2.8% and M is 2.4%, so U is slightly more common.

 But also, P is in both.

 I would go with ""SPOUT"" because it gets U and avoids the less common M? But M is common too. Wait, we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"" but E is excluded -> so invalid.

 Similarly, ""HOMES"" has E -> invalid.

 Then ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H -> valid? Yes, and it has S, P, L, U, H. L is common.

 But in feedback, we want positions as well.

 Since we don't have any constraints on positions, any word without excluded letters is okay.

 I'll decide to use ""SPOUT"". It uses S, P, O, U, T, which are all common and avoids the excluded letters.

 So my second guess is ""SPOUT"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word, I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters entirely. I'll select a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, U, P) to maximize information.

My next guess is **SPOUT** (S, P, O, U, T), which contains high-frequency letters while avoiding the excluded set.

 - T: 9.1, S: 6.5, L: 4.0, O: 7.5, M: 2.4, U: 2.8 -> U is slightly more common than M? Actually, U is more common than M: wait, according to standard frequencies:

 Order: T (9%), A (8%), S (6%), H (6%), I (5%) ... then O (5%), M (3%), U (3%), ... 

 But we removed A and E? Then after A and E are removed, the next vowels are I and O, then U. 

 Since we have to avoid A and E, words without I or U might be possible? But we don't know.

 Given that, we choose a word that covers multiple high-frequency letters.

 I think ""SPOUT"" has S, P, O, U, T -> very high frequency letters: T, S, O, U, and P is also common.

 Alternatively, ""STOMP"" has S, T, O, M, P -> but M might be less common than U? Actually U is about 2.8% and M is 2.4%, so U is slightly more common.

 But also, P is in both.

 I would go with ""SPOUT"" because it gets U and avoids the less common M? But M is common too. Wait, we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"" but E is excluded -> so invalid.

 Similarly, ""HOMES"" has E -> invalid.

 Then ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H -> valid? Yes, and it has S, P, L, U, H. L is common.

 But in feedback, we want positions as well.

 Since we don't have any constraints on positions, any word without excluded letters is okay.

 I'll decide to use ""SPOUT"". It uses S, P, O, U, T, which are all common and avoids the excluded letters.

 So my second guess is ""SPOUT"".Based on the previous feedback that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word, I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters entirely. I'll select a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, U, P) to maximize information.

My next guess is **SPOUT** (S, P, O, U, T), which contains high-frequency letters while avoiding the excluded set.

We have feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters marked 'x', meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

Guess 2: ""spout"" -> 
  S(x) -> S is not in the word
  P(-) -> P is in the word but in the wrong position
  O(-) -> O is in the word but in the wrong position
  U(x) -> U is not in the word
  T(x) -> T is not in the word

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word contains P and O, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""spout"". Specifically, P was in position 2 and O in position 3, so in the secret word, P is not at position 2 and O is not at position 3.
- Additionally, the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.

We also know the word must be 5 letters and composed of letters not in the excluded set.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: P and O are in the word, so we must include them. The word has exactly 5 letters, so we have 3 more letters to choose from the available set, but we must avoid the excluded ones.

We also know the positions: 
- P is not at position 2 (index 1, if we index from 0).
- O is not at position 3 (index 2).

Now, we need to form a word that includes P and O, and three other letters from the available set, and then assign them to positions such that P is not at position 2 and O is not at position 3.

We should also consider the frequency of the remaining letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters left: L, I, M, H, G, B, F, Y, etc.

We can try to form words that have P and O, and then use common letters like L, I, H, M, etc.

Possible words:

- We know P and O must be in the word. Let's think of words that have P and O, and avoid the excluded letters.

For example:
- ""POLKA"": P, O, L, K, A -> but A is excluded (from guess1: A(x)), so invalid.
- ""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P -> but P repeated? And Y is allowed. However, we have two P's? The word ""polyp"" has two P's. But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, in our feedback, for ""spout"", we had only one P and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the secret word had two P's, then we might have seen two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we only guessed one P, we only get one mark. So it's possible that the word has two P's? But we don't have evidence. We should avoid assuming duplicates for now.

But note: the feedback for ""spout"" had only one P marked, so if the secret word has two P's, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no. The feedback is per letter in the guess. Since we only provided one P, we only get one mark for P, even if the word has two. But if the secret word has two P's and we guess one, we only get one mark. Similarly, if we guess two and the word has one, we get one mark and one miss.

But to keep it simple, let's avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

So, words with P and O, and three other distinct letters from the available set.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P (but we already have one P, so we can have another? but we are avoiding duplicates for now), O (already one, so avoid another O?).

But note: we are not forced to avoid duplicates, but to minimize complexity, we can.

So, let's look for words with P, O, and three other distinct letters from {B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}, without repeating P or O.

But P and O are already in the word, so we can have one each.

Now, the word must have 5 letters: so we need three more.

Possible words:

- ""POLKA"": invalid because of A.
- ""POLLY"": P, O, L, L, Y -> has duplicate L? Actually, ""polly"" has two L's. We are avoiding duplicates? But L is a common letter. However, we can consider it if necessary.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N and T are excluded (from guess1: N(x) and guess2: T(x)), so invalid.
- ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> U and N excluded, invalid.
- ""PODGY"": P, O, D, G, Y -> D, G, Y are available. So this is a candidate: PODGY.
- ""POKEY"": P, O, K, E, Y -> E excluded, invalid.
- ""PIGMY"": P, I, G, M, Y -> but no O? We must have O. So invalid.
- ""LOOPY"": L, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O and we are avoiding duplicates? Also, O is repeated. But we know O is in the word, but we don't know if it's repeated. However, to avoid complexity, we skip.

Another one: ""PHOTO"": P, H, O, T, O -> T excluded and duplicate O, invalid.

""BOOTY"": B, O, O, T, Y -> T excluded and duplicate O.

""FOOTY"": same, F, O, O, T, Y -> T excluded.

""GOOPY"": G, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O.

""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> duplicate B, and no P? We need P.

We must have P and O.

""PLOY"": too short.

We need 5 letters.

""POLLY"": P, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L. But let's consider if we don't avoid duplicates.

But we are trying to avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Another word: ""POOCH"": P, O, O, C, H -> C excluded and duplicate O.

""POOH"": too short.

""POINT"" is invalid.

""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> A excluded.

""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> U excluded.

""PODGY"": P, O, D, G, Y -> this seems valid: P, O, D, G, Y. No duplicates, and D, G, Y are available.

Is ""PODGY"" a word? It means a short and fat person, but it's a valid English word.

Another one: ""POXED"": P, O, X, E, D -> E excluded.

""POMMY"": P, O, M, M, Y -> duplicate M.

""POMBE"": P, O, M, B, E -> E excluded.

""POMBO"": not a word.

""POMELO"": too long.

""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P -> duplicate P. We have two P's? The word ""polyp"" has two P's? Actually, ""polyp"" is spelled P-O-L-Y-P, so it has two P's. But we are avoiding duplicates.

But let's consider: we know P is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. Similarly for O.

However, in the feedback for ""spout"", we had P marked as present, but we don't know if there is another P. So if we guess a word with two P's, we might get more information, but it might be less efficient.

To keep it simple, I'll go with ""PODGY"" for now.

But we have to consider the position constraints:

In ""spout"", P was at position 2 (index 1) and O at position 3 (index 2). So in the secret word, P cannot be at position 1 (index 1) and O cannot be at position 2 (index 2).

In ""PODGY"", the positions are:
P at position 1 (index 0)
O at position 2 (index 1)
D at position 3 (index 2)
G at position 4 (index 3)
Y at position 5 (index 4)

But the constraint: O cannot be at position 2 (index 1) because in ""spout"" it was at index 2 and was marked as present but wrong position? Wait, let me clarify:

In ""spout"":
- Position 1: S (index0) -> x
- Position 2: P (index1) -> - (present but wrong position)
- Position 3: O (index2) -> - (present but wrong position)
- Position 4: U (index3) -> x
- Position 5: T (index4) -> x

So the feedback says:
- P is in the word but not at index1.
- O is in the word but not at index2.

Therefore, in our new guess ""PODGY"":
- We are putting P at index0. This is allowed because the constraint is only that it cannot be at index1. It can be at index0.
- We are putting O at index1. But the constraint says O cannot be at index2? The constraint is that O is not at index2 (which was the position in ""spout""). But in ""PODGY"", we are putting O at index1, which is a different position. So that's allowed? The constraint is only that it is not at the position we guessed (index2). It can be at any other position.

So ""PODGY"" is acceptable.

But note: we are putting O at index1, which is not index2, so that's fine.

Similarly, P at index0 is not index1, so that's fine.

But we are also testing D, G, Y.

Alternatively, we can try other words.

Another word: ""BIPOD"" -> B, I, P, O, D -> but P is at index2? And we have P and O. But the word ""bipod"" has P at index2 and O at index3. But we don't have constraints on P at index2? The constraint for P is that it cannot be at index1. Index2 is allowed. Similarly for O, it cannot be at index2? In ""bipod"", O is at index3, which is not index2, so allowed.

But ""bipod"" is a valid word (a stand for a camera, etc.).

But it has P at index2 and O at index3.

But we don't know if that's correct.

However, we are trying to get more information.

But ""bipod"" uses B, I, P, O, D. All are available.

But we also have to consider that we are testing more common letters? D and I are common.

But ""PODGY"" has D, G, Y. G and Y are less common? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""GIPON"" -> but N excluded.

""DOLLY"" -> no P.

""DOGMA"" -> A excluded.

""DOZEN"" -> E and N excluded.

""DOILY"" -> D, O, I, L, Y -> but no P? We must have P.

We must have both P and O.

""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> N and E excluded.

""OPTED"": O, P, T, E, D -> T and E excluded.

""OOPED"": O, O, P, E, D -> duplicate O and E excluded.

""PLUMB"": P, L, U, M, B -> U excluded.

""PLUMY"": P, L, U, M, Y -> U excluded.

""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H -> has P, but no O? We need O.

""PYGMY"": P, Y, G, M, Y -> duplicate Y, and no O.

""PODIA"": P, O, D, I, A -> A excluded.

""PODGY"" seems a reasonable choice.

Another one: ""POIND"" - not common.

""POINT"" invalid.

""YMPES"" - not a word.

I think ""PODGY"" is acceptable.

But let's check if there is a word with more common letters.

Common letters left: L, I, H, M, B, D, G, F, etc.

How about ""POLED"": P, O, L, E, D -> E excluded.

""POLER"": P, O, L, E, R -> E and R excluded.

""PILOT"": P, I, L, O, T -> T excluded.

""PILOT"" has T, which is excluded.

""PITHY"": P, I, T, H, Y -> T excluded.

""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> N excluded.

""PICKY"": P, I, C, K, Y -> C excluded.

""PIGMY"" without O.

""BLOOP"": B, L, O, O, P -> duplicate O.

""BLOOM"": B, L, O, O, M -> duplicate O, and no P.

""BLOBS"": B, L, O, B, S -> duplicate B, S excluded.

""BLOOP"" is a word? It might be, but duplicate O.

""FLOPY"": F, L, O, P, Y -> has P and O, and F, L, Y. But ""flopy"" is not a word? The common spelling is ""floppy"", which is 6 letters. ""Flop"" is 4. So invalid.

""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> U excluded.

""GLOOP"": G, L, O, O, P -> duplicate O.

""GLOPY"": not a word.

""HIPPY"": H, I, P, P, Y -> duplicate P, and no O.

""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> duplicate B, no P.

""HOLLY"": H, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L, no P.

""JUMBO"": J, U, M, B, O -> U excluded.

""LOAMY"": L, O, A, M, Y -> A excluded.

""LOOPY"": L, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O.

""MOLLY"": M, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L, no P.

""POPPY"": duplicate P, and no O? P,O,P,P,Y -> has O? P-O-P-P-Y, so O is there, but three P's? Not good.

""PUDDY"": P, U, D, D, Y -> U excluded and duplicate D.

""PULPY"": P, U, L, P, Y -> U excluded and duplicate P.

""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> no O.

""YAPOK"": Y, A, P, O, K -> A excluded.

""YOKED"": Y, O, K, E, D -> E excluded.

""YOLKY"": Y, O, L, K, Y -> duplicate Y, no P.

So after this, ""PODGY"" seems a valid option.

Another word: ""BODGY"" - not common, but ""bodgy"" is a word? Meaning inferior, but I think it's acceptable. But it has B, O, D, G, Y -> no P? We need P.

""PODGY"" has P.

""DOGGY"" has no P or O? D,O,G,G,Y -> has O, but no P and duplicate G.

So I think ""PODGY"" is a good choice.

We can also consider ""DOZYP"" - not a word.

Or ""PYOID"" - not common.

So I'll go with ""PODGY"".

But let's confirm the positions:

In ""PODGY"":
- P at position 1 (index0) -> allowed because the constraint is only that P is not at index1.
- O at position 2 (index1) -> but the constraint for O is that it is not at index2 (from ""spout"" where it was at index2). Here it is at index1, which is different, so allowed.

We are also testing D at index2, G at index3, Y at index4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has P and O in positions that are not forbidden and that are different from the previous guess to test new positions.

In ""spout"", P was at index1 and O at index2, so we are now trying P at index0 and O at index1.

That's fine.

Another word: ""OPING"" - O, P, I, N, G -> N excluded.

""OPIUM"": O, P, I, U, M -> U excluded.

""OPTIC"": O, P, T, I, C -> T and C excluded.

""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R and T excluded.

""ORDER"": O, R, D, E, R -> multiple exclusions.

I think ""PODGY"" is acceptable.

So I'll guess ""PODGY"".
</think>
Based on the previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane"") had all letters marked as absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
- Guess 2 (""spout"") had:
  - S absent (x)
  - P present but wrong position (-)
  - O present but wrong position (-)
  - U absent (x)
  - T absent (x)

This means:
- The secret word contains P and O, but P is not in position 2 (index 1) and O is not in position 3 (index 2).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.
- Available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (with O and P confirmed present).

For the next guess:
- Must include P and O (since they are confirmed present).
- P cannot be in position 2, and O cannot in position 3.
- Avoid the excluded letters and prioritize common unused letters (e.g., D, G, Y, L, I) to maximize information.
- Avoid letter repetition for now to test more letters.

After evaluating possible words, ""PODGY"" (P, O, D, G, Y) fits:
- Contains P and O.
- P is in position 1 (index 0), which is allowed (not position 2).
- O is in position 2 (index 1), which is allowed (not position 3).
- Tests new common letters: D, G, Y.
- All letters are distinct and from the available set.

<guess>podgy</guess>",podgy,"We have feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters marked 'x', meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

Guess 2: ""spout"" -> 
  S(x) -> S is not in the word
  P(-) -> P is in the word but in the wrong position
  O(-) -> O is in the word but in the wrong position
  U(x) -> U is not in the word
  T(x) -> T is not in the word

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word contains P and O, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""spout"". Specifically, P was in position 2 and O in position 3, so in the secret word, P is not at position 2 and O is not at position 3.
- Additionally, the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.

We also know the word must be 5 letters and composed of letters not in the excluded set.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: P and O are in the word, so we must include them. The word has exactly 5 letters, so we have 3 more letters to choose from the available set, but we must avoid the excluded ones.

We also know the positions: 
- P is not at position 2 (index 1, if we index from 0).
- O is not at position 3 (index 2).

Now, we need to form a word that includes P and O, and three other letters from the available set, and then assign them to positions such that P is not at position 2 and O is not at position 3.

We should also consider the frequency of the remaining letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters left: L, I, M, H, G, B, F, Y, etc.

We can try to form words that have P and O, and then use common letters like L, I, H, M, etc.

Possible words:

- We know P and O must be in the word. Let's think of words that have P and O, and avoid the excluded letters.

For example:
- ""POLKA"": P, O, L, K, A -> but A is excluded (from guess1: A(x)), so invalid.
- ""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P -> but P repeated? And Y is allowed. However, we have two P's? The word ""polyp"" has two P's. But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, in our feedback, for ""spout"", we had only one P and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the secret word had two P's, then we might have seen two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we only guessed one P, we only get one mark. So it's possible that the word has two P's? But we don't have evidence. We should avoid assuming duplicates for now.

But note: the feedback for ""spout"" had only one P marked, so if the secret word has two P's, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no. The feedback is per letter in the guess. Since we only provided one P, we only get one mark for P, even if the word has two. But if the secret word has two P's and we guess one, we only get one mark. Similarly, if we guess two and the word has one, we get one mark and one miss.

But to keep it simple, let's avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

So, words with P and O, and three other distinct letters from the available set.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P (but we already have one P, so we can have another? but we are avoiding duplicates for now), O (already one, so avoid another O?).

But note: we are not forced to avoid duplicates, but to minimize complexity, we can.

So, let's look for words with P, O, and three other distinct letters from {B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}, without repeating P or O.

But P and O are already in the word, so we can have one each.

Now, the word must have 5 letters: so we need three more.

Possible words:

- ""POLKA"": invalid because of A.
- ""POLLY"": P, O, L, L, Y -> has duplicate L? Actually, ""polly"" has two L's. We are avoiding duplicates? But L is a common letter. However, we can consider it if necessary.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N and T are excluded (from guess1: N(x) and guess2: T(x)), so invalid.
- ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> U and N excluded, invalid.
- ""PODGY"": P, O, D, G, Y -> D, G, Y are available. So this is a candidate: PODGY.
- ""POKEY"": P, O, K, E, Y -> E excluded, invalid.
- ""PIGMY"": P, I, G, M, Y -> but no O? We must have O. So invalid.
- ""LOOPY"": L, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O and we are avoiding duplicates? Also, O is repeated. But we know O is in the word, but we don't know if it's repeated. However, to avoid complexity, we skip.

Another one: ""PHOTO"": P, H, O, T, O -> T excluded and duplicate O, invalid.

""BOOTY"": B, O, O, T, Y -> T excluded and duplicate O.

""FOOTY"": same, F, O, O, T, Y -> T excluded.

""GOOPY"": G, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O.

""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> duplicate B, and no P? We need P.

We must have P and O.

""PLOY"": too short.

We need 5 letters.

""POLLY"": P, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L. But let's consider if we don't avoid duplicates.

But we are trying to avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Another word: ""POOCH"": P, O, O, C, H -> C excluded and duplicate O.

""POOH"": too short.

""POINT"" is invalid.

""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> A excluded.

""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> U excluded.

""PODGY"": P, O, D, G, Y -> this seems valid: P, O, D, G, Y. No duplicates, and D, G, Y are available.

Is ""PODGY"" a word? It means a short and fat person, but it's a valid English word.

Another one: ""POXED"": P, O, X, E, D -> E excluded.

""POMMY"": P, O, M, M, Y -> duplicate M.

""POMBE"": P, O, M, B, E -> E excluded.

""POMBO"": not a word.

""POMELO"": too long.

""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P -> duplicate P. We have two P's? The word ""polyp"" has two P's? Actually, ""polyp"" is spelled P-O-L-Y-P, so it has two P's. But we are avoiding duplicates.

But let's consider: we know P is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. Similarly for O.

However, in the feedback for ""spout"", we had P marked as present, but we don't know if there is another P. So if we guess a word with two P's, we might get more information, but it might be less efficient.

To keep it simple, I'll go with ""PODGY"" for now.

But we have to consider the position constraints:

In ""spout"", P was at position 2 (index 1) and O at position 3 (index 2). So in the secret word, P cannot be at position 1 (index 1) and O cannot be at position 2 (index 2).

In ""PODGY"", the positions are:
P at position 1 (index 0)
O at position 2 (index 1)
D at position 3 (index 2)
G at position 4 (index 3)
Y at position 5 (index 4)

But the constraint: O cannot be at position 2 (index 1) because in ""spout"" it was at index 2 and was marked as present but wrong position? Wait, let me clarify:

In ""spout"":
- Position 1: S (index0) -> x
- Position 2: P (index1) -> - (present but wrong position)
- Position 3: O (index2) -> - (present but wrong position)
- Position 4: U (index3) -> x
- Position 5: T (index4) -> x

So the feedback says:
- P is in the word but not at index1.
- O is in the word but not at index2.

Therefore, in our new guess ""PODGY"":
- We are putting P at index0. This is allowed because the constraint is only that it cannot be at index1. It can be at index0.
- We are putting O at index1. But the constraint says O cannot be at index2? The constraint is that O is not at index2 (which was the position in ""spout""). But in ""PODGY"", we are putting O at index1, which is a different position. So that's allowed? The constraint is only that it is not at the position we guessed (index2). It can be at any other position.

So ""PODGY"" is acceptable.

But note: we are putting O at index1, which is not index2, so that's fine.

Similarly, P at index0 is not index1, so that's fine.

But we are also testing D, G, Y.

Alternatively, we can try other words.

Another word: ""BIPOD"" -> B, I, P, O, D -> but P is at index2? And we have P and O. But the word ""bipod"" has P at index2 and O at index3. But we don't have constraints on P at index2? The constraint for P is that it cannot be at index1. Index2 is allowed. Similarly for O, it cannot be at index2? In ""bipod"", O is at index3, which is not index2, so allowed.

But ""bipod"" is a valid word (a stand for a camera, etc.).

But it has P at index2 and O at index3.

But we don't know if that's correct.

However, we are trying to get more information.

But ""bipod"" uses B, I, P, O, D. All are available.

But we also have to consider that we are testing more common letters? D and I are common.

But ""PODGY"" has D, G, Y. G and Y are less common? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""GIPON"" -> but N excluded.

""DOLLY"" -> no P.

""DOGMA"" -> A excluded.

""DOZEN"" -> E and N excluded.

""DOILY"" -> D, O, I, L, Y -> but no P? We must have P.

We must have both P and O.

""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> N and E excluded.

""OPTED"": O, P, T, E, D -> T and E excluded.

""OOPED"": O, O, P, E, D -> duplicate O and E excluded.

""PLUMB"": P, L, U, M, B -> U excluded.

""PLUMY"": P, L, U, M, Y -> U excluded.

""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H -> has P, but no O? We need O.

""PYGMY"": P, Y, G, M, Y -> duplicate Y, and no O.

""PODIA"": P, O, D, I, A -> A excluded.

""PODGY"" seems a reasonable choice.

Another one: ""POIND"" - not common.

""POINT"" invalid.

""YMPES"" - not a word.

I think ""PODGY"" is acceptable.

But let's check if there is a word with more common letters.

Common letters left: L, I, H, M, B, D, G, F, etc.

How about ""POLED"": P, O, L, E, D -> E excluded.

""POLER"": P, O, L, E, R -> E and R excluded.

""PILOT"": P, I, L, O, T -> T excluded.

""PILOT"" has T, which is excluded.

""PITHY"": P, I, T, H, Y -> T excluded.

""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> N excluded.

""PICKY"": P, I, C, K, Y -> C excluded.

""PIGMY"" without O.

""BLOOP"": B, L, O, O, P -> duplicate O.

""BLOOM"": B, L, O, O, M -> duplicate O, and no P.

""BLOBS"": B, L, O, B, S -> duplicate B, S excluded.

""BLOOP"" is a word? It might be, but duplicate O.

""FLOPY"": F, L, O, P, Y -> has P and O, and F, L, Y. But ""flopy"" is not a word? The common spelling is ""floppy"", which is 6 letters. ""Flop"" is 4. So invalid.

""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> U excluded.

""GLOOP"": G, L, O, O, P -> duplicate O.

""GLOPY"": not a word.

""HIPPY"": H, I, P, P, Y -> duplicate P, and no O.

""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> duplicate B, no P.

""HOLLY"": H, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L, no P.

""JUMBO"": J, U, M, B, O -> U excluded.

""LOAMY"": L, O, A, M, Y -> A excluded.

""LOOPY"": L, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O.

""MOLLY"": M, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L, no P.

""POPPY"": duplicate P, and no O? P,O,P,P,Y -> has O? P-O-P-P-Y, so O is there, but three P's? Not good.

""PUDDY"": P, U, D, D, Y -> U excluded and duplicate D.

""PULPY"": P, U, L, P, Y -> U excluded and duplicate P.

""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> no O.

""YAPOK"": Y, A, P, O, K -> A excluded.

""YOKED"": Y, O, K, E, D -> E excluded.

""YOLKY"": Y, O, L, K, Y -> duplicate Y, no P.

So after this, ""PODGY"" seems a valid option.

Another word: ""BODGY"" - not common, but ""bodgy"" is a word? Meaning inferior, but I think it's acceptable. But it has B, O, D, G, Y -> no P? We need P.

""PODGY"" has P.

""DOGGY"" has no P or O? D,O,G,G,Y -> has O, but no P and duplicate G.

So I think ""PODGY"" is a good choice.

We can also consider ""DOZYP"" - not a word.

Or ""PYOID"" - not common.

So I'll go with ""PODGY"".

But let's confirm the positions:

In ""PODGY"":
- P at position 1 (index0) -> allowed because the constraint is only that P is not at index1.
- O at position 2 (index1) -> but the constraint for O is that it is not at index2 (from ""spout"" where it was at index2). Here it is at index1, which is different, so allowed.

We are also testing D at index2, G at index3, Y at index4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has P and O in positions that are not forbidden and that are different from the previous guess to test new positions.

In ""spout"", P was at index1 and O at index2, so we are now trying P at index0 and O at index1.

That's fine.

Another word: ""OPING"" - O, P, I, N, G -> N excluded.

""OPIUM"": O, P, I, U, M -> U excluded.

""OPTIC"": O, P, T, I, C -> T and C excluded.

""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R and T excluded.

""ORDER"": O, R, D, E, R -> multiple exclusions.

I think ""PODGY"" is acceptable.

So I'll guess ""PODGY"".Based on the previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane"") had all letters marked as absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
- Guess 2 (""spout"") had:
  - S absent (x)
  - P present but wrong position (-)
  - O present but wrong position (-)
  - U absent (x)
  - T absent (x)

This means:
- The secret word contains P and O, but P is not in position 2 (index 1) and O is not in position 3 (index 2).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.
- Available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (with O and P confirmed present).

For the next guess:
- Must include P and O (since they are confirmed present).
- P cannot be in position 2, and O cannot in position 3.
- Avoid the excluded letters and prioritize common unused letters (e.g., D, G, Y, L, I) to maximize information.
- Avoid letter repetition for now to test more letters.

After evaluating possible words, ""PODGY"" (P, O, D, G, Y) fits:
- Contains P and O.
- P is in position 1 (index 0), which is allowed (not position 2).
- O is in position 2 (index 1), which is allowed (not position 3).
- Tests new common letters: D, G, Y.
- All letters are distinct and from the available set.",Guess 3: podgy -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) D(x) G(x) Y(✓),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,4,poppy,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in all letters marked with 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid these letters entirely in our next guess.

 Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.
 Let's think about other common vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels remaining: O, U, I (and sometimes Y)
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but I is a vowel, and Y can be both)

 Since A and E are out, we should focus on O and U for vowels, and common consonants like S, T, L, etc.

 A good second guess might include other high-frequency letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's consider words with letters like S, T, L, O, U, P, M, H, etc.

 Possible words:
 - ""TOILS"" but that has I and S, but let's see if we can find one without the excluded letters.

 Alternatively, let's try ""SPOUT"":
   S, P, O, U, T -> none of C, R, A, N, E.

 But we want to maximize new information. Another common word might be ""GHOUL"", but it has G, H, O, U, L.

 However, a word that covers more common letters: ""MOUTH"" has M, O, U, T, H.

 But let's think of words that might have letters like S, L, T, O, U.

 After excluding C, R, A, N, E, the most common letters in English are S, T, L, O, etc.

 We can use a word like ""SOUPY"" but Y might be less common.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" has P, I, O, U, S.

 But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Let me list a few options:
 1. ""SPLIT"" - S, P, L, I, T -> no C,R,A,N,E.
 2. ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T -> same.
 3. ""BUOYS"" - B, U, O, Y, S -> but Y is less common.
 4. ""GHOUL"" - G, H, O, U, L -> includes U and O.

 Considering coverage, ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has M, O, I, S, T.

 But note that in the previous feedback we know nothing about the secret word. We need to maximize the chance of hitting some letters.

 Since the secret word has no C, R, A, N, E, it must be composed of letters from the remaining set.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice for the second guess.

 Alternatively, ""PYLON"" has Y (which is not excluded) and N is excluded? Wait no, N was in the first guess and we got x for N, so N is out. PYLON has N, which is excluded. So invalid.

 Another option: ""LOUTS"" - L, O, U, T, S -> no excluded letters.

 Or ""TULIP"" - T, U, L, I, P.

 However, I recall that ""SLIPT"" is not a common word, so ""SPLIT"" is better.

 Another popular one: ""FUDGY"" but Y is less common and we might avoid it.

 Perhaps ""HOIST"" has H, O, I, S, T.

 I think ""HOIST"" or ""MOIST"" are both good. Let's choose ""HOIST"".

 But note: we haven't tested H, O, I, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"" is a word: S, H, O, U, T.

 We want to include U? It might be less common than I. But U appears in many words.

 After excluding C, R, A, N, E, the frequency order might change.

 Considering standard English letter frequency after removing C, R, A, N, E:

 Remaining letters by frequency in English: 
 S, T, L, O, M, U, P, D, G, H, I, B, Y, F, V, K, W, X, Z, J, Q.

 So we want to cover the top remaining: S, T, L, O, M, U, P, etc.

 Let's try to include S, T, L, O, U? But in a 5-letter word, it's hard to get all.

 We can choose:

 Option 1: ""SLOUT"" -> but ""SLOUT"" might not be a valid word? Actually, ""LOUTS"" is valid.

 Option 2: ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S -> covers S, P, O, U, I. I is a vowel and might be useful.

 But note that we don't have L or T in that.

 How about ""STOMP""? S, T, O, M, P. This has S, T, O, M, P, which are all high-frequency.

 But we don't have U or I? It's okay because we are trying to get more common letters.

 However, ""STOMP"" is valid.

 But note: we must avoid E, A, N, R, C. STOMP: S, T, O, M, P -> none of the excluded.

 So I think ""STOMP"" is a good choice.

 Alternatively, ""SPOUT"" is also valid: S, P, O, U, T.

 Which one? ""STOMP"" avoids U and uses M which is common. ""SPOUT"" gives us U.

 Since we have no information, and U is the 6th most common vowel after A, E, I, O (and A,E are excluded), we might consider U.

 But M is more common than U? In fact, in standard frequency, M is more common than U.

 Let me check (approximate frequencies):
 - T: 9.1, S: 6.5, L: 4.0, O: 7.5, M: 2.4, U: 2.8 -> U is slightly more common than M? Actually, U is more common than M: wait, according to standard frequencies:

 Order: T (9%), A (8%), S (6%), H (6%), I (5%) ... then O (5%), M (3%), U (3%), ... 

 But we removed A and E? Then after A and E are removed, the next vowels are I and O, then U. 

 Since we have to avoid A and E, words without I or U might be possible? But we don't know.

 Given that, we choose a word that covers multiple high-frequency letters.

 I think ""SPOUT"" has S, P, O, U, T -> very high frequency letters: T, S, O, U, and P is also common.

 Alternatively, ""STOMP"" has S, T, O, M, P -> but M might be less common than U? Actually U is about 2.8% and M is 2.4%, so U is slightly more common.

 But also, P is in both.

 I would go with ""SPOUT"" because it gets U and avoids the less common M? But M is common too. Wait, we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"" but E is excluded -> so invalid.

 Similarly, ""HOMES"" has E -> invalid.

 Then ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H -> valid? Yes, and it has S, P, L, U, H. L is common.

 But in feedback, we want positions as well.

 Since we don't have any constraints on positions, any word without excluded letters is okay.

 I'll decide to use ""SPOUT"". It uses S, P, O, U, T, which are all common and avoids the excluded letters.

 So my second guess is ""SPOUT"".Based on the previous feedback that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word, I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters entirely. I'll select a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, U, P) to maximize information.

My next guess is **SPOUT** (S, P, O, U, T), which contains high-frequency letters while avoiding the excluded set.

<guess>spout</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: spout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) O(-) U(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters marked 'x', meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

Guess 2: ""spout"" -> 
  S(x) -> S is not in the word
  P(-) -> P is in the word but in the wrong position
  O(-) -> O is in the word but in the wrong position
  U(x) -> U is not in the word
  T(x) -> T is not in the word

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word contains P and O, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""spout"". Specifically, P was in position 2 and O in position 3, so in the secret word, P is not at position 2 and O is not at position 3.
- Additionally, the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.

We also know the word must be 5 letters and composed of letters not in the excluded set.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: P and O are in the word, so we must include them. The word has exactly 5 letters, so we have 3 more letters to choose from the available set, but we must avoid the excluded ones.

We also know the positions: 
- P is not at position 2 (index 1, if we index from 0).
- O is not at position 3 (index 2).

Now, we need to form a word that includes P and O, and three other letters from the available set, and then assign them to positions such that P is not at position 2 and O is not at position 3.

We should also consider the frequency of the remaining letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters left: L, I, M, H, G, B, F, Y, etc.

We can try to form words that have P and O, and then use common letters like L, I, H, M, etc.

Possible words:

- We know P and O must be in the word. Let's think of words that have P and O, and avoid the excluded letters.

For example:
- ""POLKA"": P, O, L, K, A -> but A is excluded (from guess1: A(x)), so invalid.
- ""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P -> but P repeated? And Y is allowed. However, we have two P's? The word ""polyp"" has two P's. But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, in our feedback, for ""spout"", we had only one P and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the secret word had two P's, then we might have seen two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we only guessed one P, we only get one mark. So it's possible that the word has two P's? But we don't have evidence. We should avoid assuming duplicates for now.

But note: the feedback for ""spout"" had only one P marked, so if the secret word has two P's, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no. The feedback is per letter in the guess. Since we only provided one P, we only get one mark for P, even if the word has two. But if the secret word has two P's and we guess one, we only get one mark. Similarly, if we guess two and the word has one, we get one mark and one miss.

But to keep it simple, let's avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

So, words with P and O, and three other distinct letters from the available set.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P (but we already have one P, so we can have another? but we are avoiding duplicates for now), O (already one, so avoid another O?).

But note: we are not forced to avoid duplicates, but to minimize complexity, we can.

So, let's look for words with P, O, and three other distinct letters from {B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}, without repeating P or O.

But P and O are already in the word, so we can have one each.

Now, the word must have 5 letters: so we need three more.

Possible words:

- ""POLKA"": invalid because of A.
- ""POLLY"": P, O, L, L, Y -> has duplicate L? Actually, ""polly"" has two L's. We are avoiding duplicates? But L is a common letter. However, we can consider it if necessary.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N and T are excluded (from guess1: N(x) and guess2: T(x)), so invalid.
- ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> U and N excluded, invalid.
- ""PODGY"": P, O, D, G, Y -> D, G, Y are available. So this is a candidate: PODGY.
- ""POKEY"": P, O, K, E, Y -> E excluded, invalid.
- ""PIGMY"": P, I, G, M, Y -> but no O? We must have O. So invalid.
- ""LOOPY"": L, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O and we are avoiding duplicates? Also, O is repeated. But we know O is in the word, but we don't know if it's repeated. However, to avoid complexity, we skip.

Another one: ""PHOTO"": P, H, O, T, O -> T excluded and duplicate O, invalid.

""BOOTY"": B, O, O, T, Y -> T excluded and duplicate O.

""FOOTY"": same, F, O, O, T, Y -> T excluded.

""GOOPY"": G, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O.

""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> duplicate B, and no P? We need P.

We must have P and O.

""PLOY"": too short.

We need 5 letters.

""POLLY"": P, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L. But let's consider if we don't avoid duplicates.

But we are trying to avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Another word: ""POOCH"": P, O, O, C, H -> C excluded and duplicate O.

""POOH"": too short.

""POINT"" is invalid.

""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> A excluded.

""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> U excluded.

""PODGY"": P, O, D, G, Y -> this seems valid: P, O, D, G, Y. No duplicates, and D, G, Y are available.

Is ""PODGY"" a word? It means a short and fat person, but it's a valid English word.

Another one: ""POXED"": P, O, X, E, D -> E excluded.

""POMMY"": P, O, M, M, Y -> duplicate M.

""POMBE"": P, O, M, B, E -> E excluded.

""POMBO"": not a word.

""POMELO"": too long.

""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P -> duplicate P. We have two P's? The word ""polyp"" has two P's? Actually, ""polyp"" is spelled P-O-L-Y-P, so it has two P's. But we are avoiding duplicates.

But let's consider: we know P is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. Similarly for O.

However, in the feedback for ""spout"", we had P marked as present, but we don't know if there is another P. So if we guess a word with two P's, we might get more information, but it might be less efficient.

To keep it simple, I'll go with ""PODGY"" for now.

But we have to consider the position constraints:

In ""spout"", P was at position 2 (index 1) and O at position 3 (index 2). So in the secret word, P cannot be at position 1 (index 1) and O cannot be at position 2 (index 2).

In ""PODGY"", the positions are:
P at position 1 (index 0)
O at position 2 (index 1)
D at position 3 (index 2)
G at position 4 (index 3)
Y at position 5 (index 4)

But the constraint: O cannot be at position 2 (index 1) because in ""spout"" it was at index 2 and was marked as present but wrong position? Wait, let me clarify:

In ""spout"":
- Position 1: S (index0) -> x
- Position 2: P (index1) -> - (present but wrong position)
- Position 3: O (index2) -> - (present but wrong position)
- Position 4: U (index3) -> x
- Position 5: T (index4) -> x

So the feedback says:
- P is in the word but not at index1.
- O is in the word but not at index2.

Therefore, in our new guess ""PODGY"":
- We are putting P at index0. This is allowed because the constraint is only that it cannot be at index1. It can be at index0.
- We are putting O at index1. But the constraint says O cannot be at index2? The constraint is that O is not at index2 (which was the position in ""spout""). But in ""PODGY"", we are putting O at index1, which is a different position. So that's allowed? The constraint is only that it is not at the position we guessed (index2). It can be at any other position.

So ""PODGY"" is acceptable.

But note: we are putting O at index1, which is not index2, so that's fine.

Similarly, P at index0 is not index1, so that's fine.

But we are also testing D, G, Y.

Alternatively, we can try other words.

Another word: ""BIPOD"" -> B, I, P, O, D -> but P is at index2? And we have P and O. But the word ""bipod"" has P at index2 and O at index3. But we don't have constraints on P at index2? The constraint for P is that it cannot be at index1. Index2 is allowed. Similarly for O, it cannot be at index2? In ""bipod"", O is at index3, which is not index2, so allowed.

But ""bipod"" is a valid word (a stand for a camera, etc.).

But it has P at index2 and O at index3.

But we don't know if that's correct.

However, we are trying to get more information.

But ""bipod"" uses B, I, P, O, D. All are available.

But we also have to consider that we are testing more common letters? D and I are common.

But ""PODGY"" has D, G, Y. G and Y are less common? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""GIPON"" -> but N excluded.

""DOLLY"" -> no P.

""DOGMA"" -> A excluded.

""DOZEN"" -> E and N excluded.

""DOILY"" -> D, O, I, L, Y -> but no P? We must have P.

We must have both P and O.

""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> N and E excluded.

""OPTED"": O, P, T, E, D -> T and E excluded.

""OOPED"": O, O, P, E, D -> duplicate O and E excluded.

""PLUMB"": P, L, U, M, B -> U excluded.

""PLUMY"": P, L, U, M, Y -> U excluded.

""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H -> has P, but no O? We need O.

""PYGMY"": P, Y, G, M, Y -> duplicate Y, and no O.

""PODIA"": P, O, D, I, A -> A excluded.

""PODGY"" seems a reasonable choice.

Another one: ""POIND"" - not common.

""POINT"" invalid.

""YMPES"" - not a word.

I think ""PODGY"" is acceptable.

But let's check if there is a word with more common letters.

Common letters left: L, I, H, M, B, D, G, F, etc.

How about ""POLED"": P, O, L, E, D -> E excluded.

""POLER"": P, O, L, E, R -> E and R excluded.

""PILOT"": P, I, L, O, T -> T excluded.

""PILOT"" has T, which is excluded.

""PITHY"": P, I, T, H, Y -> T excluded.

""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> N excluded.

""PICKY"": P, I, C, K, Y -> C excluded.

""PIGMY"" without O.

""BLOOP"": B, L, O, O, P -> duplicate O.

""BLOOM"": B, L, O, O, M -> duplicate O, and no P.

""BLOBS"": B, L, O, B, S -> duplicate B, S excluded.

""BLOOP"" is a word? It might be, but duplicate O.

""FLOPY"": F, L, O, P, Y -> has P and O, and F, L, Y. But ""flopy"" is not a word? The common spelling is ""floppy"", which is 6 letters. ""Flop"" is 4. So invalid.

""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> U excluded.

""GLOOP"": G, L, O, O, P -> duplicate O.

""GLOPY"": not a word.

""HIPPY"": H, I, P, P, Y -> duplicate P, and no O.

""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> duplicate B, no P.

""HOLLY"": H, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L, no P.

""JUMBO"": J, U, M, B, O -> U excluded.

""LOAMY"": L, O, A, M, Y -> A excluded.

""LOOPY"": L, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O.

""MOLLY"": M, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L, no P.

""POPPY"": duplicate P, and no O? P,O,P,P,Y -> has O? P-O-P-P-Y, so O is there, but three P's? Not good.

""PUDDY"": P, U, D, D, Y -> U excluded and duplicate D.

""PULPY"": P, U, L, P, Y -> U excluded and duplicate P.

""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> no O.

""YAPOK"": Y, A, P, O, K -> A excluded.

""YOKED"": Y, O, K, E, D -> E excluded.

""YOLKY"": Y, O, L, K, Y -> duplicate Y, no P.

So after this, ""PODGY"" seems a valid option.

Another word: ""BODGY"" - not common, but ""bodgy"" is a word? Meaning inferior, but I think it's acceptable. But it has B, O, D, G, Y -> no P? We need P.

""PODGY"" has P.

""DOGGY"" has no P or O? D,O,G,G,Y -> has O, but no P and duplicate G.

So I think ""PODGY"" is a good choice.

We can also consider ""DOZYP"" - not a word.

Or ""PYOID"" - not common.

So I'll go with ""PODGY"".

But let's confirm the positions:

In ""PODGY"":
- P at position 1 (index0) -> allowed because the constraint is only that P is not at index1.
- O at position 2 (index1) -> but the constraint for O is that it is not at index2 (from ""spout"" where it was at index2). Here it is at index1, which is different, so allowed.

We are also testing D at index2, G at index3, Y at index4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has P and O in positions that are not forbidden and that are different from the previous guess to test new positions.

In ""spout"", P was at index1 and O at index2, so we are now trying P at index0 and O at index1.

That's fine.

Another word: ""OPING"" - O, P, I, N, G -> N excluded.

""OPIUM"": O, P, I, U, M -> U excluded.

""OPTIC"": O, P, T, I, C -> T and C excluded.

""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R and T excluded.

""ORDER"": O, R, D, E, R -> multiple exclusions.

I think ""PODGY"" is acceptable.

So I'll guess ""PODGY"".Based on the previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane"") had all letters marked as absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
- Guess 2 (""spout"") had:
  - S absent (x)
  - P present but wrong position (-)
  - O present but wrong position (-)
  - U absent (x)
  - T absent (x)

This means:
- The secret word contains P and O, but P is not in position 2 (index 1) and O is not in position 3 (index 2).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.
- Available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (with O and P confirmed present).

For the next guess:
- Must include P and O (since they are confirmed present).
- P cannot be in position 2, and O cannot in position 3.
- Avoid the excluded letters and prioritize common unused letters (e.g., D, G, Y, L, I) to maximize information.
- Avoid letter repetition for now to test more letters.

After evaluating possible words, ""PODGY"" (P, O, D, G, Y) fits:
- Contains P and O.
- P is in position 1 (index 0), which is allowed (not position 2).
- O is in position 2 (index 1), which is allowed (not position 3).
- Tests new common letters: D, G, Y.
- All letters are distinct and from the available set.

Let\'s choose ""HOIST"".\n\n But note: we haven\'t tested H, O, I, S, T.\n\n Alternatively, ""SHOUT"" is a word: S, H, O, U, T.\n\n We want to include U? It might be less common than I. But U appears in many words.\n\n After excluding C, R, A, N, E, the frequency order might change.\n\n Considering standard English letter frequency after removing C, R, A, N, E:\n\n Remaining letters by frequency in English: \n S, T, L, O, M, U, P, D, G, H, I, B, Y, F, V, K, W, X, Z, J, Q.\n\n So we want to cover the top remaining: S, T, L, O, M, U, P, etc.\n\n Let\'s try to include S, T, L, O, U? But in a 5-letter word, it\'s hard to get all.\n\n We can choose:\n\n Option 1: ""SLOUT"" -> but ""SLOUT"" might not be a valid word? Actually, ""LOUTS"" is valid.\n\n Option 2: ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S -> covers S, P, O, U, I. I is a vowel and might be useful.\n\n But note that we don\'t have L or T in that.\n\n How about ""STOMP""? S, T, O, M, P. This has S, T, O, M, P, which are all high-frequency.\n\n But we don\'t have U or I? It\'s okay because we are trying to get more common letters.\n\n However, ""STOMP"" is valid.\n\n But note: we must avoid E, A, N, R, C. STOMP: S, T, O, M, P -> none of the excluded.\n\n So I think ""STOMP"" is a good choice.\n\n Alternatively, ""SPOUT"" is also valid: S, P, O, U, T.\n\n Which one? ""STOMP"" avoids U and uses M which is common. ""SPOUT"" gives us U.\n\n Since we have no information, and U is the 6th most common vowel after A, E, I, O (and A,E are excluded), we might consider U.\n\n But M is more common than U? In fact, in standard frequency, M is more common than U.\n\n Let me check (approximate frequencies):\n - T: 9.1, S: 6.5, L: 4.0, O: 7.5, M: 2.4, U: 2.8 -> U is slightly more common than M? Actually, U is more common than M: wait, according to standard frequencies:\n\n Order: T (9%), A (8%), S (6%), H (6%), I (5%) ... then O (5%), M (3%), U (3%), ... \n\n But we removed A and E? Then after A and E are removed, the next vowels are I and O, then U. \n\n Since we have to avoid A and E, words without I or U might be possible? But we don\'t know.\n\n Given that, we choose a word that covers multiple high-frequency letters.\n\n I think ""SPOUT"" has S, P, O, U, T -> very high frequency letters: T, S, O, U, and P is also common.\n\n Alternatively, ""STOMP"" has S, T, O, M, P -> but M might be less common than U? Actually U is about 2.8% and M is 2.4%, so U is slightly more common.\n\n But also, P is in both.\n\n I would go with ""SPOUT"" because it gets U and avoids the less common M? But M is common too. Wait, we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"" but E is excluded -> so invalid.\n\n Similarly, ""HOMES"" has E -> invalid.\n\n Then ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H -> valid? Yes, and it has S, P, L, U, H. L is common.\n\n But in feedback, we want positions as well.\n\n Since we don\'t have any constraints on positions, any word without excluded letters is okay.\n\n I\'ll decide to use ""SPOUT"". It uses S, P, O, U, T, which are all common and avoids the excluded letters.\n\n So my second guess is ""SPOUT"".Based on the previous feedback that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word, I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters entirely. I\'ll select a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, U, P) to maximize information.\n\nMy next guess is **SPOUT** (S, P, O, U, T), which contains high-frequency letters while avoiding the excluded set.\n\n<guess>spout</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) O(-) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters marked \'x\', meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.\n\nGuess 2: ""spout"" -> \n  S(x) -> S is not in the word\n  P(-) -> P is in the word but in the wrong position\n  O(-) -> O is in the word but in the wrong position\n  U(x) -> U is not in the word\n  T(x) -> T is not in the word\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n- The secret word contains P and O, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""spout"".

And Y is allowed. However, we have two P\'s? The word ""polyp"" has two P\'s. But we don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, in our feedback, for ""spout"", we had only one P and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the secret word had two P\'s, then we might have seen two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we only guessed one P, we only get one mark. So it\'s possible that the word has two P\'s? But we don\'t have evidence. We should avoid assuming duplicates for now.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""spout"" had only one P marked, so if the secret word has two P\'s, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no. The feedback is per letter in the guess. Since we only provided one P, we only get one mark for P, even if the word has two. But if the secret word has two P\'s and we guess one, we only get one mark.

Actually, ""polly"" has two L\'s. We are avoiding duplicates? But L is a common letter. However, we can consider it if necessary.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\n- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N and T are excluded (from guess1: N(x) and guess2: T(x)), so invalid.\n- ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> U and N excluded, invalid.\n- ""PODGY"": P, O, D, G, Y -> D, G, Y are available. So this is a candidate: PODGY.\n- ""POKEY"": P, O, K, E, Y -> E excluded, invalid.\n- ""PIGMY"": P, I, G, M, Y -> but no O? We must have O. So invalid.\n- ""LOOPY"": L, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O and we are avoiding duplicates? Also, O is repeated. But we know O is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s repeated. However, to avoid complexity, we skip.\n\nAnother one: ""PHOTO"": P, H, O, T, O -> T excluded and duplicate O, invalid.\n\n""BOOTY"": B, O, O, T, Y -> T excluded and duplicate O.\n\n""FOOTY"": same, F, O, O, T, Y -> T excluded.\n\n""GOOPY"": G, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O.\n\n""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> duplicate B, and no P? We need P.\n\nWe must have P and O.\n\n""PLOY"": too short.\n\nWe need 5 letters.\n\n""POLLY"": P, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L. But let\'s consider if we don\'t avoid duplicates.\n\nBut we are trying to avoid duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nAnother word: ""POOCH"": P, O, O, C, H -> C excluded and duplicate O.\n\n""POOH"": too short.\n\n""POINT"" is invalid.\n\n""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> A excluded.\n\n""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> U excluded.\n\n""PODGY"": P, O, D, G, Y -> this seems valid: P, O, D, G, Y. No duplicates, and D, G, Y are available.\n\nIs ""PODGY"" a word? It means a short and fat person, but it\'s a valid English word.\n\nAnother one: ""POXED"": P, O, X, E, D -> E excluded.\n\n""POMMY"": P, O, M, M, Y -> duplicate M.\n\n""POMBE"": P, O, M, B, E -> E excluded.\n\n""POMBO"": not a word.\n\n""POMELO"": too long.\n\n""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P -> duplicate P. We have two P\'s? The word ""polyp"" has two P\'s? Actually, ""polyp"" is spelled P-O-L-Y-P, so it has two P\'s. But we are avoiding duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we know P is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears once or twice. Similarly for O.\n\nHowever, in the feedback for ""spout"", we had P marked as present, but we don\'t know if there is another P. So if we guess a word with two P\'s, we might get more information, but it might be less efficient.\n\nTo keep it simple, I\'ll go with ""PODGY"" for now.\n\nBut we have to consider the position constraints:\n\nIn ""spout"", P was at position 2 (index 1) and O at position 3 (index 2). So in the secret word, P cannot be at position 1 (index 1) and O cannot be at position 2 (index 2).\n\nIn ""PODGY"", the positions are:\nP at position 1 (index 0)\nO at position 2 (index 1)\nD at position 3 (index 2)\nG at position 4 (index 3)\nY at position 5 (index 4)\n\nBut the constraint: O cannot be at position 2 (index 1) because in ""spout"" it was at index 2 and was marked as present but wrong position? Wait, let me clarify:\n\nIn ""spout"":\n- Position 1: S (index0) -> x\n- Position 2: P (index1) -> - (present but wrong position)\n- Position 3: O (index2) -> - (present but wrong position)\n- Position 4: U (index3) -> x\n- Position 5: T (index4) -> x\n\nSo the feedback says:\n- P is in the word but not at index1.\n- O is in the word but not at index2.\n\nTherefore, in our new guess ""PODGY"":\n- We are putting P at index0. This is allowed because the constraint is only that it cannot be at index1. It can be at index0.\n- We are putting O at index1. But the constraint says O cannot be at index2? The constraint is that O is not at index2 (which was the position in ""spout""). But in ""PODGY"", we are putting O at index1, which is a different position. So that\'s allowed? The constraint is only that it is not at the position we guessed (index2). It can be at any other position.\n\nSo ""PODGY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we are putting O at index1, which is not index2, so that\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, P at index0 is not index1, so that\'s fine.\n\nBut we are also testing D, G, Y.\n\nAlternatively, we can try other words.\n\nAnother word: ""BIPOD"" -> B, I, P, O, D -> but P is at index2? And we have P and O. But the word ""bipod"" has P at index2 and O at index3. But we don\'t have constraints on P at index2? The constraint for P is that it cannot be at index1. Index2 is allowed. Similarly for O, it cannot be at index2? In ""bipod"", O is at index3, which is not index2, so allowed.\n\nBut ""bipod"" is a valid word (a stand for a camera, etc.).\n\nBut it has P at index2 and O at index3.\n\nBut we don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\nHowever, we are trying to get more information.\n\nBut ""bipod"" uses B, I, P, O, D. All are available.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we are testing more common letters? D and I are common.\n\nBut ""PODGY"" has D, G, Y. G and Y are less common? But we don\'t have many options.\n\nAnother word: ""GIPON"" -> but N excluded.\n\n""DOLLY"" -> no P.\n\n""DOGMA"" -> A excluded.\n\n""DOZEN"" -> E and N excluded.\n\n""DOILY"" -> D, O, I, L, Y -> but no P? We must have P.\n\nWe must have both P and O.\n\n""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> N and E excluded.\n\n""OPTED"": O, P, T, E, D -> T and E excluded.\n\n""OOPED"": O, O, P, E, D -> duplicate O and E excluded.\n\n""PLUMB"": P, L, U, M, B -> U excluded.\n\n""PLUMY"": P, L, U, M, Y -> U excluded.\n\n""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H -> has P, but no O? We need O.\n\n""PYGMY"": P, Y, G, M, Y -> duplicate Y, and no O.\n\n""PODIA"": P, O, D, I, A -> A excluded.\n\n""PODGY"" seems a reasonable choice.\n\nAnother one: ""POIND"" - not common.\n\n""POINT"" invalid.\n\n""YMPES"" - not a word.\n\nI think ""PODGY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s check if there is a word with more common letters.\n\nCommon letters left: L, I, H, M, B, D, G, F, etc.\n\nHow about ""POLED"": P, O, L, E, D -> E excluded.\n\n""POLER"": P, O, L, E, R -> E and R excluded.\n\n""PILOT"": P, I, L, O, T -> T excluded.\n\n""PILOT"" has T, which is excluded.\n\n""PITHY"": P, I, T, H, Y -> T excluded.\n\n""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> N excluded.\n\n""PICKY"": P, I, C, K, Y -> C excluded.\n\n""PIGMY"" without O.\n\n""BLOOP"": B, L, O, O, P -> duplicate O.\n\n""BLOOM"": B, L, O, O, M -> duplicate O, and no P.\n\n""BLOBS"": B, L, O, B, S -> duplicate B, S excluded.\n\n""BLOOP"" is a word? It might be, but duplicate O.\n\n""FLOPY"": F, L, O, P, Y -> has P and O, and F, L, Y. But ""flopy"" is not a word? The common spelling is ""floppy"", which is 6 letters. ""Flop"" is 4. So invalid.\n\n""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> U excluded.\n\n""GLOOP"": G, L, O, O, P -> duplicate O.\n\n""GLOPY"": not a word.\n\n""HIPPY"": H, I, P, P, Y -> duplicate P, and no O.\n\n""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> duplicate B, no P.\n\n""HOLLY"": H, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L, no P.\n\n""JUMBO"": J, U, M, B, O -> U excluded.\n\n""LOAMY"": L, O, A, M, Y -> A excluded.\n\n""LOOPY"": L, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O.\n\n""MOLLY"": M, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L, no P.\n\n""POPPY"": duplicate P, and no O? P,O,P,P,Y -> has O? P-O-P-P-Y, so O is there, but three P\'s? Not good.\n\n""PUDDY"": P, U, D, D, Y -> U excluded and duplicate D.\n\n""PULPY"": P, U, L, P, Y -> U excluded and duplicate P.\n\n""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> no O.\n\n""YAPOK"": Y, A, P, O, K -> A excluded.\n\n""YOKED"": Y, O, K, E, D -> E excluded.\n\n""YOLKY"": Y, O, L, K, Y -> duplicate Y, no P.\n\nSo after this, ""PODGY"" seems a valid option.\n\nAnother word: ""BODGY"" - not common, but ""bodgy"" is a word? Meaning inferior, but I think it\'s acceptable. But it has B, O, D, G, Y -> no P? We need P.\n\n""PODGY"" has P.\n\n""DOGGY"" has no P or O? D,O,G,G,Y -> has O, but no P and duplicate G.\n\nSo I think ""PODGY"" is a good choice.\n\nWe can also consider ""DOZYP"" - not a word.\n\nOr ""PYOID"" - not common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""PODGY"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the positions:\n\nIn ""PODGY"":\n- P at position 1 (index0) -> allowed because the constraint is only that P is not at index1.\n- O at position 2 (index1) -> but the constraint for O is that it is not at index2 (from ""spout"" where it was at index2). Here it is at index1, which is different, so allowed.\n\nWe are also testing D at index2, G at index3, Y at index4.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that has P and O in positions that are not forbidden and that are different from the previous guess to test new positions.\n\nIn ""spout"", P was at index1 and O at index2, so we are now trying P at index0 and O at index1.\n\nThat\'s fine.\n\nAnother word: ""OPING"" - O, P, I, N, G -> N excluded.\n\n""OPIUM"": O, P, I, U, M -> U excluded.\n\n""OPTIC"": O, P, T, I, C -> T and C excluded.\n\n""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R and T excluded.\n\n""ORDER"": O, R, D, E, R -> multiple exclusions.\n\nI think ""PODGY"" is acceptable.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""PODGY"".Based on the previous feedback:\n- Guess 1 (""crane"") had all letters marked as absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).\n- Guess 2 (""spout"") had:\n  - S absent (x)\n  - P present but wrong position (-)\n  - O present but wrong position (-)\n  - U absent (x)\n  - T absent (x)\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word contains P and O, but P is not in position 2 (index 1) and O is not in position 3 (index 2).\n- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.\n- Available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (with O and P confirmed present).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include P and O (since they are confirmed present).\n- P cannot be in position 2, and O cannot in position 3.\n- Avoid the excluded letters and prioritize common unused letters (e.g., D, G, Y, L, I) to maximize information.\n- Avoid letter repetition for now to test more letters.\n\nAfter evaluating possible words, ""PODGY"" (P, O, D, G, Y) fits:\n- Contains P and O.\n- P is in position 1 (index 0), which is allowed (not position 2).\n- O is in position 2 (index 1), which is allowed (not position 3).\n- Tests new common letters: D, G, Y.\n- All letters are distinct and from the available set.\n\n<guess>podgy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) O(-) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: podgy -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) D(x) G(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from the third guess: ""podgy"" resulted in:
  P(✓) - correct and in the right position (position 1, index 0)
  O(✓) - correct and in the right position (position 2, index 1)
  D(x) - not in the word
  G(x) - not in the word
  Y(✓) - correct and in the right position (position 5, index 4)

So, we know:
- The secret word has P at position 1 (index 0), O at position 2 (index 1), and Y at position 5 (index 4).
- The secret word does not contain D or G.
- Additionally, from previous guesses, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G.

Now, the secret word pattern is: P _ O _ Y, where the second and fourth positions are unknown.

We need to fill the blanks (positions 3 and 4, index 2 and 3) with letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G.

Available letters: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note that P and O and Y are already used and in place. However, the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates so far. Since we have P, O, Y in place, and we are missing two letters, we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we have three confirmed: P, O, Y at positions 1,2,5. So positions 3 and 4 (index 2 and 3) are missing.

We need two letters from the available set: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words of the form P?O??Y:

Let's think of words that start with ""PO"", then a letter, then another letter, and end with ""Y"".

Common patterns:

- POL?Y -> but L is available, but then we have ""POLKY""? Not a word. ""POLY"" is 4 letters. ""POLY"" words are usually longer.

- POM?Y -> ""POM"" is a root, but ""POMBY"" not a word. ""POMMY"" is a word? But we have G excluded and M is available. ""POMMY"" has two M's? P-O-M-M-Y. But we have position 3 (index2) and 4 (index3) to fill. So if we put M at index2 and M at index3, we get ""POMMY"". But is that valid? ""Pommy"" is a slang word for a British person. And it has duplicate M. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates.

But in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates yet, so it's possible.

But let's check the feedback for duplicates: in previous guesses, we didn't have duplicates, and the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates. But we can't rule it out.

However, to be safe, let's first try without duplicates.

So, the word is P _ O _ Y, with two distinct letters in the middle.

Possible letters for position 3 (index2) and position 4 (index3): from {B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z}

We need to form a valid word.

Let's list possible words:

- ""POLKY"" -> not a word.
- ""POLLY"" -> P-O-L-L-Y -> but then position 3 (index2) is L and position 4 (index3) is L? That would be duplicate L. And ""POLLY"" is a valid word. But we have duplicate L. Also, we have to check if L is available: yes, L is not excluded.

But if we avoid duplicates, we skip.

- ""POKEY"" -> P-O-K-E-Y -> but E is excluded, invalid.
- ""PONKY"" -> not a word.
- ""POXEY"" -> not common.
- ""POBBY"" -> not a word.
- ""POF?Y"" -> no.
- ""POH?Y"" -> ""POH"" is not common, ""POHLY"" not a word.
- ""POILY"" -> P-O-I-L-Y -> that would be ""POILY"", which might not be a word? But ""oily"" is a word, so ""POILY"" isn't standard.

Another idea: ""POPPY"" -> but that's P-O-P-P-Y, which has duplicate P and we already have P at the start. But the secret word has P at the start, so if there is another P, it would be duplicate. But in ""POPPY"", the second P is at position 3 (index2) and third P at index3? P-O-P-P-Y. So positions: index0: P, index1: O, index2: P, index3: P, index4: Y. But we have O at index1, which is correct, and Y at index4, correct. But we have two more P's. However, we don't know if the word has multiple P's. But in our second guess ""spout"", we had P marked as present but wrong position, and we only guessed one P. If the word had multiple P's, we might have seen multiple marks? But the feedback only marks the letters that are in the word, and for each guessed P, if it is in the word, it gets a mark. Since we guessed one P, we only get one mark. So it's possible that there are multiple P's.

But let's see: if the word is ""POPPY"", then in ""spout"", we had P at index1, which in ""POPPY"" the P's are at index0,2,3. So at index1, there is O, not P. So the P in ""spout"" at index1 was not in the correct position, but there is a P in the word (at index0,2,3). So the feedback for P in ""spout"" would be present but wrong position, which matches. Similarly, in ""podgy"", we had P at index0 correct, and if the word is ""POPPY"", then we also have P at index2 and index3, but we didn't guess them, so we don't know.

But in ""podgy"", we guessed D at index2 and G at index3, which were marked absent. So if the word is ""POPPY"", then at index2 and index3, it should be P, but we guessed D and G, so they are absent, which is consistent. And Y at index4 is correct.

So ""POPPY"" is a candidate? But we have to check the letters: P, O, P, P, Y. But we have three P's? And O and Y.

But the excluded letters: D and G are absent, which is good. And other exclusions: no C,R,A,N,E,S,U,T.

But ""POPPY"" has only three distinct letters: P, O, Y.

But it is a valid word.

However, in our third guess, we had Y at index4 correct, and P at index0 correct, O at index1 correct. So the word must have P at 0, O at 1, and Y at 4. The middle two positions are unknown.

In ""POPPY"", the middle two are both P. So it fits the pattern.

But we need to confirm if it's possible. The feedback for ""podgy"" had D and G absent, which is consistent with ""POPPY"".

But we don't know for sure.

Another candidate: ""POLLY"" - P-O-L-L-Y. This has L at index2 and index3. And L is not excluded. And in ""podgy"", we had D and G absent, which is consistent.

Similarly, ""POLLY"" is a valid word.

Another one: ""JOLTY"" -> but T is excluded.

""MOLLY"" -> M-O-L-L-Y, but no P? We need P at the start.

""HOLLY"" -> no P.

""FILLY"" -> no P.

So for the pattern P_O_ _Y, we have:

- ""POLLY"" (P-O-L-L-Y)
- ""POPPY"" (P-O-P-P-Y)
- ""PALLY"" -> P-A-L-L-Y, but A is excluded.
- ""PULPY"" -> U excluded.
- ""PURPY"" -> not a word.
- ""PIXEY"" -> not common, but ""pixie"" is 5 letters? P-I-X-I-E, but E excluded and not ending with Y.
- ""PICKY"" -> C and K? C excluded, and K is available, but ""PICKY"" is P-I-C-K-Y, C excluded.
- ""PINKY"" -> N excluded.
- ""PIETY"" -> E excluded.
- ""WIFEY"" -> W-I-F-E-Y, E excluded.
- ""WILLY"" -> no P.
- ""BILLY"" -> no P.
- ""HILLY"" -> no P.
- ""LOLLY"" -> no P.
- ""DOLLY"" -> no P.

What about ""POKEY""? E excluded.

""POKY"" is 4 letters.

""POMEY"" -> not a word.

""POMBE"" -> E excluded.

""POMEL"" -> not a word.

""POMLY"" -> not a word.

""PONCY"" -> N excluded? P-O-N-C-Y, N and C excluded.

""POOVY"" -> O at index1 and index2? P-O-O-V-Y, but we have O at index1, and then O at index2? But we need O only at index1. And V is available. But ""POOVY"" is not a word.

""POOTY"" -> O at index1 and index2? and T excluded.

""POOHY"" -> O at index1 and index2? and H is available. ""Poohy"" might be informal, but not standard.

""POOPY"" -> P-O-O-P-Y, which has O at index1 and index2? And P at index0 and index3. But we have Y at index4. So ""POOPY"" is P-O-O-P-Y. Then positions: index0: P, index1: O, index2: O, index3: P, index4: Y. But we have O at index1 (correct) and also at index2? And P at index0 and index3. But in our pattern, we have O at index1, but the word has O at index2 as well? That's allowed, but we don't have a constraint. However, in ""podgy"", we had O at index1, which is correct, but if the word has O at index2, we didn't guess it. But in ""spout"", we had O at index2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word has O at index2, then in ""spout"" when we put O at index2, it should have been marked correct (✓), not wrong position (-). But in guess2, for O, we got (-), meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So if the word had O at index2, then when we guessed O at index2, it should be correct. But it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that the O is not at index2. Therefore, the secret word does not have O at index2. So in ""POOPY"", if it has O at index2, that would contradict the feedback from guess2.

Similarly, for ""POPPY"", it has P at index2 and index3, but in guess2, we had P at index1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word has P at index2, then when we put P at index1, it is wrong position, which is fine, and we didn't test index2 in guess2. But for O in guess2: we put O at index2 and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that the O is not at index2. So the secret word has O, but not at index2. Therefore, in the secret word, O is at index1 (as we now know from guess3) and not at index2.

So for the secret word, position index2 cannot be O. Similarly, position index3 cannot be O? We don't know, but we have O only at index1.

Therefore, in our pattern P _ O _ Y, the first blank is index2 and the second is index3. We know index2 cannot be O (from guess2 feedback), and we now know it is not D or G (from guess3), and not any excluded.

Similarly, index3 cannot be O? We don't have direct constraint, but we know O is only at index1.

But the word might have multiple O's? For example, if the word has O at index1 and index3, that would be allowed. But in guess2, when we put O at index2, it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word has O at index3, then when we put O at index2, it is not at the correct position, so it would be marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent. So it is possible to have O at index3.

But in our current pattern, we have O at index1, and we are looking for index2 and index3.

So index2 cannot be O (because if it were, in guess2 when we put O at index2, it would be correct, but it was marked as wrong position). Therefore, index2 is not O.

Index3 could be O? But we don't have information. However, in guess3, we put D at index2 and G at index3, and they were absent, so index3 is not G, but it could be O.

But if index3 is O, then the word would be P _ O O Y, but with O at index1 and index3? Then the pattern is P-O-?-O-Y? No: positions: index0: P, index1: O, index2: ?, index3: O, index4: Y. But we have O at index1 and index3.

But in the pattern, we have O at index1, and we are to fill index2 and index3. So if index3 is O, then the word has two O's.

But we don't know.

However, let's list possible words:

- ""POLLY"": P-O-L-L-Y -> index2: L, index3: L. L is not excluded. And O is only at index1, so index2 is not O, which is good. And index3 is L, not O.
- ""POPPY"": P-O-P-P-Y -> index2: P, index3: P. P is not excluded, and index2 is not O (it's P), so that's good.
- ""POILY"": P-O-I-L-Y -> index2: I, index3: L. I and L are available. But is ""POILY"" a word? It doesn't seem standard; ""oily"" is a word, but ""poily"" isn't.
- ""POKEY"": not valid due to E.
- ""POMEY"": not a word.
- ""POBBY"": not a word.
- ""POOFY"": P-O-O-F-Y -> but then index2 is O? But we said index2 cannot be O. Because if index2 is O, then in guess2 when we put O at index2, it should be correct, but it was marked as wrong position. So ""POOFY"" has O at index2, which is invalid. Similarly, any word with O at index2 is invalid.
- ""POOPY"": P-O-O-P-Y -> index2 is O, invalid.
- ""POLKY"": not a word.
- ""POWDY"": not a word.
- ""JOWLY"": J-O-W-L-Y -> but no P at start? We have P at start.

We need P at index0.

""POWRY""? not a word.

""POWAY"" - proper noun.

""POXEY"" - not common.

""POZKY"" - not a word.

So the only common words I can think of are ""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"".

Now, we have to choose between them.

We also have other possibilities, like ""PALLY"", but A excluded.

""PUDDY"" - U excluded.

""PURPY"" - not a word.

""PURSY"" - U excluded? P-U-R-S-Y, U,R,S excluded.

""PYGMY"" - no O.

So likely, the word is either ""POLLY"" or ""POPPY"".

To distinguish, we can guess a word that tests L and P in the middle positions.

But we are constrained by the known positions.

We know P at 0, O at 1, Y at 4. So we must have a word that starts with ""PO"" and ends with ""Y"".

We can guess ""POLLY"" or ""POPPY"" directly.

But we have 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4.

If we guess ""POLLY"" and it's wrong, we still have two more guesses.

Similarly for ""POPPY"".

But to maximize information, we could guess a word that has L and P in positions 3 and 4, but we have fixed positions 0,1,4.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses other letters to test.

But we have only two positions to fill, and we know the other three.

We can guess ""POLLY"" to test.

But let's see the feedback we would get.

If we guess ""POLLY"":
- P at 0: correct (we know)
- O at 1: correct (we know)
- L at 2: to be determined
- L at 3: to be determined
- Y at 4: correct (we know)

If the word is ""POLLY"", we get all correct.

If the word is ""POPPY"", then at index2 we have L but should be P, so L would be absent? Or if the word has no L, it would be absent. Similarly for index3.

Similarly, if we guess ""POPPY"", and the word is ""POLLY"", then at index2 we have P but should be L, so P would be marked as absent (if no other P) or present if there is another P, but we have P at index0.

In ""POLLY"", there is only one P at index0. So if we guess ""POPPY"" and the word is ""POLLY"", then:
- P at index0: correct
- O at index1: correct
- P at index2: not in the word (since ""POLLY"" has no P at index2, and only one P at index0) -> so marked absent (x)
- P at index3: absent (x)
- Y at index4: correct

So we would get: P(✓) O(✓) P(x) P(x) Y(✓)

Similarly, if we guess ""POLLY"" and the word is ""POPPY"":
- P(✓) O(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓)

So in either case, we get two x's in the middle.

But we can use this to distinguish.

However, we might guess a word that has different letters to test more.

For example, guess a word like ""PALLY"", but A excluded.

""PILKY"" - not a word.

""PILMY"" - not a word.

""PIMPY"" - not common.

""PINNY"" - N excluded.

""PIPPY"" - P-O-?-P-Y, but we need to fill index2 and index3. ""PIPPY"" is P-I-P-P-Y, so index0:P, index1:I, index2:P, index3:P, index4:Y. But we need O at index1, so it must be P-O-?-?-Y. So ""PIPPY"" doesn't have O at index1.

We must have O at index1.

So we are limited.

Another word: ""POLYP"" - P-O-L-Y-P, but then it ends with P, not Y. We need Y at index4.

""POLYP"" is P-O-L-Y-P, so index4 is P, not Y.

So not.

""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"" are the main candidates.

But there is also ""POWDY""? Not a word.

""POWLY""? Not a word.

""POLEY""? P-O-L-E-Y, E excluded.

""POTTY"" - T excluded.

""POTSY"" - T excluded.

""POMEY"" - not a word.

""POMLY"" - not a word.

""PONKY"" - not a word.

""JOLTY"" - T excluded.

""FOLLY"" - no P.

So I think we have to choose between ""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"".

To break the tie, we can consider letter frequency or just guess one.

Since we are at guess 4, we can guess ""POLLY"" and see.

But let's see if there is a word that can test both.

For example, if we guess a word that has L in position 3 and P in position 2, but we have fixed positions.

We can't because the first two and last are fixed.

Another idea: guess a word that is not of the form, but that would violate the known correct positions, which we shouldn't do because we know P, O, Y are fixed.

So we must guess a word that has P at 0, O at 1, Y at 4.

So the only flexibility is positions 2 and 3.

We can guess ""PULPY"" but U excluded.

""PALMY"" - A excluded.

""PELMY"" - E excluded.

""PIMPY"" - not common.

I think we have to go with one of the two.

Let's choose ""POLLY"" because L is more common than having duplicate P.

Or ""POPPY"" is also common.

But in terms of frequency, L is more common than P, but we already have one P.

Perhaps ""POLLY"" is more likely.

But let's look for the answer.

We can guess ""POLLY"".

If it's not, then it must be ""POPPY"".

So I'll guess ""POLLY"".

But in the feedback from guess2, we had O at index2 marked as present but wrong position. If the word is ""POLLY"", then O is only at index1, so when we put O at index2 in guess2, it was wrong position, which is consistent. Similarly for ""POPPY"".

Both are consistent.

So let's try ""POLLY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are not in the secret word.
- **Guess 2 (""spout"")**: 
  - S is absent (x).
  - P is present but in the wrong position (-).
  - O is present but in the wrong position (-).
  - U is absent (x).
  - T is absent (x).
- **Guess 3 (""podgy"")**:
  - P is correct and in the right position (✓) at index 0.
  - O is correct and in the right position (✓) at index 1.
  - D is absent (x).
  - G is absent (x).
  - Y is correct and in the right position (✓) at index 4.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: **P _ O _ Y** (positions: index 0 = P, index 1 = O, index 4 = Y).
- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G.
- Available letters for the unknown positions (index 2 and 3) are: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- From Guess 2, O cannot be at index 2 (since it was marked as present but wrong position when guessed there), so index 2 cannot be O.
- The word must be a valid English word. Common candidates fitting the pattern include ""POLLY"" (P-O-L-L-Y) and ""POPPY"" (P-O-P-P-Y), but other possibilities are limited due to exclusions.

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters from the available set that form a valid word.
- ""POLLY"" is a strong candidate because:
  - It uses L (a high-frequency letter) for positions 2 and 3.
  - L is not excluded and hasn't been tested yet.
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, it provides critical information to distinguish between ""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"" (e.g., if L is absent, ""POPPY"" becomes the likely candidate).
- Given the fixed positions (P, O, Y) and exclusions, ""POLLY"" maximizes the chance of solving or making progress with minimal guesses.

Thus, the next guess is **POLLY**.

<guess>polly</guess>",polly,"We have feedback from the third guess: ""podgy"" resulted in:
  P(✓) - correct and in the right position (position 1, index 0)
  O(✓) - correct and in the right position (position 2, index 1)
  D(x) - not in the word
  G(x) - not in the word
  Y(✓) - correct and in the right position (position 5, index 4)

So, we know:
- The secret word has P at position 1 (index 0), O at position 2 (index 1), and Y at position 5 (index 4).
- The secret word does not contain D or G.
- Additionally, from previous guesses, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G.

Now, the secret word pattern is: P _ O _ Y, where the second and fourth positions are unknown.

We need to fill the blanks (positions 3 and 4, index 2 and 3) with letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G.

Available letters: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note that P and O and Y are already used and in place. However, the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates so far. Since we have P, O, Y in place, and we are missing two letters, we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we have three confirmed: P, O, Y at positions 1,2,5. So positions 3 and 4 (index 2 and 3) are missing.

We need two letters from the available set: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words of the form P?O??Y:

Let's think of words that start with ""PO"", then a letter, then another letter, and end with ""Y"".

Common patterns:

- POL?Y -> but L is available, but then we have ""POLKY""? Not a word. ""POLY"" is 4 letters. ""POLY"" words are usually longer.

- POM?Y -> ""POM"" is a root, but ""POMBY"" not a word. ""POMMY"" is a word? But we have G excluded and M is available. ""POMMY"" has two M's? P-O-M-M-Y. But we have position 3 (index2) and 4 (index3) to fill. So if we put M at index2 and M at index3, we get ""POMMY"". But is that valid? ""Pommy"" is a slang word for a British person. And it has duplicate M. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates.

But in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates yet, so it's possible.

But let's check the feedback for duplicates: in previous guesses, we didn't have duplicates, and the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates. But we can't rule it out.

However, to be safe, let's first try without duplicates.

So, the word is P _ O _ Y, with two distinct letters in the middle.

Possible letters for position 3 (index2) and position 4 (index3): from {B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z}

We need to form a valid word.

Let's list possible words:

- ""POLKY"" -> not a word.
- ""POLLY"" -> P-O-L-L-Y -> but then position 3 (index2) is L and position 4 (index3) is L? That would be duplicate L. And ""POLLY"" is a valid word. But we have duplicate L. Also, we have to check if L is available: yes, L is not excluded.

But if we avoid duplicates, we skip.

- ""POKEY"" -> P-O-K-E-Y -> but E is excluded, invalid.
- ""PONKY"" -> not a word.
- ""POXEY"" -> not common.
- ""POBBY"" -> not a word.
- ""POF?Y"" -> no.
- ""POH?Y"" -> ""POH"" is not common, ""POHLY"" not a word.
- ""POILY"" -> P-O-I-L-Y -> that would be ""POILY"", which might not be a word? But ""oily"" is a word, so ""POILY"" isn't standard.

Another idea: ""POPPY"" -> but that's P-O-P-P-Y, which has duplicate P and we already have P at the start. But the secret word has P at the start, so if there is another P, it would be duplicate. But in ""POPPY"", the second P is at position 3 (index2) and third P at index3? P-O-P-P-Y. So positions: index0: P, index1: O, index2: P, index3: P, index4: Y. But we have O at index1, which is correct, and Y at index4, correct. But we have two more P's. However, we don't know if the word has multiple P's. But in our second guess ""spout"", we had P marked as present but wrong position, and we only guessed one P. If the word had multiple P's, we might have seen multiple marks? But the feedback only marks the letters that are in the word, and for each guessed P, if it is in the word, it gets a mark. Since we guessed one P, we only get one mark. So it's possible that there are multiple P's.

But let's see: if the word is ""POPPY"", then in ""spout"", we had P at index1, which in ""POPPY"" the P's are at index0,2,3. So at index1, there is O, not P. So the P in ""spout"" at index1 was not in the correct position, but there is a P in the word (at index0,2,3). So the feedback for P in ""spout"" would be present but wrong position, which matches. Similarly, in ""podgy"", we had P at index0 correct, and if the word is ""POPPY"", then we also have P at index2 and index3, but we didn't guess them, so we don't know.

But in ""podgy"", we guessed D at index2 and G at index3, which were marked absent. So if the word is ""POPPY"", then at index2 and index3, it should be P, but we guessed D and G, so they are absent, which is consistent. And Y at index4 is correct.

So ""POPPY"" is a candidate? But we have to check the letters: P, O, P, P, Y. But we have three P's? And O and Y.

But the excluded letters: D and G are absent, which is good. And other exclusions: no C,R,A,N,E,S,U,T.

But ""POPPY"" has only three distinct letters: P, O, Y.

But it is a valid word.

However, in our third guess, we had Y at index4 correct, and P at index0 correct, O at index1 correct. So the word must have P at 0, O at 1, and Y at 4. The middle two positions are unknown.

In ""POPPY"", the middle two are both P. So it fits the pattern.

But we need to confirm if it's possible. The feedback for ""podgy"" had D and G absent, which is consistent with ""POPPY"".

But we don't know for sure.

Another candidate: ""POLLY"" - P-O-L-L-Y. This has L at index2 and index3. And L is not excluded. And in ""podgy"", we had D and G absent, which is consistent.

Similarly, ""POLLY"" is a valid word.

Another one: ""JOLTY"" -> but T is excluded.

""MOLLY"" -> M-O-L-L-Y, but no P? We need P at the start.

""HOLLY"" -> no P.

""FILLY"" -> no P.

So for the pattern P_O_ _Y, we have:

- ""POLLY"" (P-O-L-L-Y)
- ""POPPY"" (P-O-P-P-Y)
- ""PALLY"" -> P-A-L-L-Y, but A is excluded.
- ""PULPY"" -> U excluded.
- ""PURPY"" -> not a word.
- ""PIXEY"" -> not common, but ""pixie"" is 5 letters? P-I-X-I-E, but E excluded and not ending with Y.
- ""PICKY"" -> C and K? C excluded, and K is available, but ""PICKY"" is P-I-C-K-Y, C excluded.
- ""PINKY"" -> N excluded.
- ""PIETY"" -> E excluded.
- ""WIFEY"" -> W-I-F-E-Y, E excluded.
- ""WILLY"" -> no P.
- ""BILLY"" -> no P.
- ""HILLY"" -> no P.
- ""LOLLY"" -> no P.
- ""DOLLY"" -> no P.

What about ""POKEY""? E excluded.

""POKY"" is 4 letters.

""POMEY"" -> not a word.

""POMBE"" -> E excluded.

""POMEL"" -> not a word.

""POMLY"" -> not a word.

""PONCY"" -> N excluded? P-O-N-C-Y, N and C excluded.

""POOVY"" -> O at index1 and index2? P-O-O-V-Y, but we have O at index1, and then O at index2? But we need O only at index1. And V is available. But ""POOVY"" is not a word.

""POOTY"" -> O at index1 and index2? and T excluded.

""POOHY"" -> O at index1 and index2? and H is available. ""Poohy"" might be informal, but not standard.

""POOPY"" -> P-O-O-P-Y, which has O at index1 and index2? And P at index0 and index3. But we have Y at index4. So ""POOPY"" is P-O-O-P-Y. Then positions: index0: P, index1: O, index2: O, index3: P, index4: Y. But we have O at index1 (correct) and also at index2? And P at index0 and index3. But in our pattern, we have O at index1, but the word has O at index2 as well? That's allowed, but we don't have a constraint. However, in ""podgy"", we had O at index1, which is correct, but if the word has O at index2, we didn't guess it. But in ""spout"", we had O at index2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word has O at index2, then in ""spout"" when we put O at index2, it should have been marked correct (✓), not wrong position (-). But in guess2, for O, we got (-), meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So if the word had O at index2, then when we guessed O at index2, it should be correct. But it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that the O is not at index2. Therefore, the secret word does not have O at index2. So in ""POOPY"", if it has O at index2, that would contradict the feedback from guess2.

Similarly, for ""POPPY"", it has P at index2 and index3, but in guess2, we had P at index1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word has P at index2, then when we put P at index1, it is wrong position, which is fine, and we didn't test index2 in guess2. But for O in guess2: we put O at index2 and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that the O is not at index2. So the secret word has O, but not at index2. Therefore, in the secret word, O is at index1 (as we now know from guess3) and not at index2.

So for the secret word, position index2 cannot be O. Similarly, position index3 cannot be O? We don't know, but we have O only at index1.

Therefore, in our pattern P _ O _ Y, the first blank is index2 and the second is index3. We know index2 cannot be O (from guess2 feedback), and we now know it is not D or G (from guess3), and not any excluded.

Similarly, index3 cannot be O? We don't have direct constraint, but we know O is only at index1.

But the word might have multiple O's? For example, if the word has O at index1 and index3, that would be allowed. But in guess2, when we put O at index2, it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word has O at index3, then when we put O at index2, it is not at the correct position, so it would be marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent. So it is possible to have O at index3.

But in our current pattern, we have O at index1, and we are looking for index2 and index3.

So index2 cannot be O (because if it were, in guess2 when we put O at index2, it would be correct, but it was marked as wrong position). Therefore, index2 is not O.

Index3 could be O? But we don't have information. However, in guess3, we put D at index2 and G at index3, and they were absent, so index3 is not G, but it could be O.

But if index3 is O, then the word would be P _ O O Y, but with O at index1 and index3? Then the pattern is P-O-?-O-Y? No: positions: index0: P, index1: O, index2: ?, index3: O, index4: Y. But we have O at index1 and index3.

But in the pattern, we have O at index1, and we are to fill index2 and index3. So if index3 is O, then the word has two O's.

But we don't know.

However, let's list possible words:

- ""POLLY"": P-O-L-L-Y -> index2: L, index3: L. L is not excluded. And O is only at index1, so index2 is not O, which is good. And index3 is L, not O.
- ""POPPY"": P-O-P-P-Y -> index2: P, index3: P. P is not excluded, and index2 is not O (it's P), so that's good.
- ""POILY"": P-O-I-L-Y -> index2: I, index3: L. I and L are available. But is ""POILY"" a word? It doesn't seem standard; ""oily"" is a word, but ""poily"" isn't.
- ""POKEY"": not valid due to E.
- ""POMEY"": not a word.
- ""POBBY"": not a word.
- ""POOFY"": P-O-O-F-Y -> but then index2 is O? But we said index2 cannot be O. Because if index2 is O, then in guess2 when we put O at index2, it should be correct, but it was marked as wrong position. So ""POOFY"" has O at index2, which is invalid. Similarly, any word with O at index2 is invalid.
- ""POOPY"": P-O-O-P-Y -> index2 is O, invalid.
- ""POLKY"": not a word.
- ""POWDY"": not a word.
- ""JOWLY"": J-O-W-L-Y -> but no P at start? We have P at start.

We need P at index0.

""POWRY""? not a word.

""POWAY"" - proper noun.

""POXEY"" - not common.

""POZKY"" - not a word.

So the only common words I can think of are ""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"".

Now, we have to choose between them.

We also have other possibilities, like ""PALLY"", but A excluded.

""PUDDY"" - U excluded.

""PURPY"" - not a word.

""PURSY"" - U excluded? P-U-R-S-Y, U,R,S excluded.

""PYGMY"" - no O.

So likely, the word is either ""POLLY"" or ""POPPY"".

To distinguish, we can guess a word that tests L and P in the middle positions.

But we are constrained by the known positions.

We know P at 0, O at 1, Y at 4. So we must have a word that starts with ""PO"" and ends with ""Y"".

We can guess ""POLLY"" or ""POPPY"" directly.

But we have 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4.

If we guess ""POLLY"" and it's wrong, we still have two more guesses.

Similarly for ""POPPY"".

But to maximize information, we could guess a word that has L and P in positions 3 and 4, but we have fixed positions 0,1,4.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses other letters to test.

But we have only two positions to fill, and we know the other three.

We can guess ""POLLY"" to test.

But let's see the feedback we would get.

If we guess ""POLLY"":
- P at 0: correct (we know)
- O at 1: correct (we know)
- L at 2: to be determined
- L at 3: to be determined
- Y at 4: correct (we know)

If the word is ""POLLY"", we get all correct.

If the word is ""POPPY"", then at index2 we have L but should be P, so L would be absent? Or if the word has no L, it would be absent. Similarly for index3.

Similarly, if we guess ""POPPY"", and the word is ""POLLY"", then at index2 we have P but should be L, so P would be marked as absent (if no other P) or present if there is another P, but we have P at index0.

In ""POLLY"", there is only one P at index0. So if we guess ""POPPY"" and the word is ""POLLY"", then:
- P at index0: correct
- O at index1: correct
- P at index2: not in the word (since ""POLLY"" has no P at index2, and only one P at index0) -> so marked absent (x)
- P at index3: absent (x)
- Y at index4: correct

So we would get: P(✓) O(✓) P(x) P(x) Y(✓)

Similarly, if we guess ""POLLY"" and the word is ""POPPY"":
- P(✓) O(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓)

So in either case, we get two x's in the middle.

But we can use this to distinguish.

However, we might guess a word that has different letters to test more.

For example, guess a word like ""PALLY"", but A excluded.

""PILKY"" - not a word.

""PILMY"" - not a word.

""PIMPY"" - not common.

""PINNY"" - N excluded.

""PIPPY"" - P-O-?-P-Y, but we need to fill index2 and index3. ""PIPPY"" is P-I-P-P-Y, so index0:P, index1:I, index2:P, index3:P, index4:Y. But we need O at index1, so it must be P-O-?-?-Y. So ""PIPPY"" doesn't have O at index1.

We must have O at index1.

So we are limited.

Another word: ""POLYP"" - P-O-L-Y-P, but then it ends with P, not Y. We need Y at index4.

""POLYP"" is P-O-L-Y-P, so index4 is P, not Y.

So not.

""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"" are the main candidates.

But there is also ""POWDY""? Not a word.

""POWLY""? Not a word.

""POLEY""? P-O-L-E-Y, E excluded.

""POTTY"" - T excluded.

""POTSY"" - T excluded.

""POMEY"" - not a word.

""POMLY"" - not a word.

""PONKY"" - not a word.

""JOLTY"" - T excluded.

""FOLLY"" - no P.

So I think we have to choose between ""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"".

To break the tie, we can consider letter frequency or just guess one.

Since we are at guess 4, we can guess ""POLLY"" and see.

But let's see if there is a word that can test both.

For example, if we guess a word that has L in position 3 and P in position 2, but we have fixed positions.

We can't because the first two and last are fixed.

Another idea: guess a word that is not of the form, but that would violate the known correct positions, which we shouldn't do because we know P, O, Y are fixed.

So we must guess a word that has P at 0, O at 1, Y at 4.

So the only flexibility is positions 2 and 3.

We can guess ""PULPY"" but U excluded.

""PALMY"" - A excluded.

""PELMY"" - E excluded.

""PIMPY"" - not common.

I think we have to go with one of the two.

Let's choose ""POLLY"" because L is more common than having duplicate P.

Or ""POPPY"" is also common.

But in terms of frequency, L is more common than P, but we already have one P.

Perhaps ""POLLY"" is more likely.

But let's look for the answer.

We can guess ""POLLY"".

If it's not, then it must be ""POPPY"".

So I'll guess ""POLLY"".

But in the feedback from guess2, we had O at index2 marked as present but wrong position. If the word is ""POLLY"", then O is only at index1, so when we put O at index2 in guess2, it was wrong position, which is consistent. Similarly for ""POPPY"".

Both are consistent.

So let's try ""POLLY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are not in the secret word.
- **Guess 2 (""spout"")**: 
  - S is absent (x).
  - P is present but in the wrong position (-).
  - O is present but in the wrong position (-).
  - U is absent (x).
  - T is absent (x).
- **Guess 3 (""podgy"")**:
  - P is correct and in the right position (✓) at index 0.
  - O is correct and in the right position (✓) at index 1.
  - D is absent (x).
  - G is absent (x).
  - Y is correct and in the right position (✓) at index 4.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: **P _ O _ Y** (positions: index 0 = P, index 1 = O, index 4 = Y).
- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G.
- Available letters for the unknown positions (index 2 and 3) are: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- From Guess 2, O cannot be at index 2 (since it was marked as present but wrong position when guessed there), so index 2 cannot be O.
- The word must be a valid English word. Common candidates fitting the pattern include ""POLLY"" (P-O-L-L-Y) and ""POPPY"" (P-O-P-P-Y), but other possibilities are limited due to exclusions.

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters from the available set that form a valid word.
- ""POLLY"" is a strong candidate because:
  - It uses L (a high-frequency letter) for positions 2 and 3.
  - L is not excluded and hasn't been tested yet.
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, it provides critical information to distinguish between ""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"" (e.g., if L is absent, ""POPPY"" becomes the likely candidate).
- Given the fixed positions (P, O, Y) and exclusions, ""POLLY"" maximizes the chance of solving or making progress with minimal guesses.

Thus, the next guess is **POLLY**.",Guess 4: polly -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓),FAIL

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word typically has common letters and a mix of vowels and consonants.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common vowels and consonants.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has the common letters C, R, A, N, E.

 So, my first guess is ""CRANE"".

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first guess: ""crane"" resulted in all letters marked with 'x', meaning none of the letters C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.
 Therefore, we must avoid these letters entirely in our next guess.

 Now, we need to choose a new 5-letter word that does not contain C, R, A, N, or E.
 Let's think about other common vowels and consonants.

 Common vowels remaining: O, U, I (and sometimes Y)
 Consonants: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but I is a vowel, and Y can be both)

 Since A and E are out, we should focus on O and U for vowels, and common consonants like S, T, L, etc.

 A good second guess might include other high-frequency letters that we haven't tried yet.

 Let's consider words with letters like S, T, L, O, U, P, M, H, etc.

 Possible words:
 - ""TOILS"" but that has I and S, but let's see if we can find one without the excluded letters.

 Alternatively, let's try ""SPOUT"":
   S, P, O, U, T -> none of C, R, A, N, E.

 But we want to maximize new information. Another common word might be ""GHOUL"", but it has G, H, O, U, L.

 However, a word that covers more common letters: ""MOUTH"" has M, O, U, T, H.

 But let's think of words that might have letters like S, L, T, O, U.

 After excluding C, R, A, N, E, the most common letters in English are S, T, L, O, etc.

 We can use a word like ""SOUPY"" but Y might be less common.

 Alternatively, ""PIOUS"" has P, I, O, U, S.

 But note: the word must be 5 letters and valid.

 Let me list a few options:
 1. ""SPLIT"" - S, P, L, I, T -> no C,R,A,N,E.
 2. ""MOIST"" - M, O, I, S, T -> same.
 3. ""BUOYS"" - B, U, O, Y, S -> but Y is less common.
 4. ""GHOUL"" - G, H, O, U, L -> includes U and O.

 Considering coverage, ""MOIST"" is a good candidate because it has M, O, I, S, T.

 But note that in the previous feedback we know nothing about the secret word. We need to maximize the chance of hitting some letters.

 Since the secret word has no C, R, A, N, E, it must be composed of letters from the remaining set.

 I think ""MOIST"" is a solid choice for the second guess.

 Alternatively, ""PYLON"" has Y (which is not excluded) and N is excluded? Wait no, N was in the first guess and we got x for N, so N is out. PYLON has N, which is excluded. So invalid.

 Another option: ""LOUTS"" - L, O, U, T, S -> no excluded letters.

 Or ""TULIP"" - T, U, L, I, P.

 However, I recall that ""SLIPT"" is not a common word, so ""SPLIT"" is better.

 Another popular one: ""FUDGY"" but Y is less common and we might avoid it.

 Perhaps ""HOIST"" has H, O, I, S, T.

 I think ""HOIST"" or ""MOIST"" are both good. Let's choose ""HOIST"".

 But note: we haven't tested H, O, I, S, T.

 Alternatively, ""SHOUT"" is a word: S, H, O, U, T.

 We want to include U? It might be less common than I. But U appears in many words.

 After excluding C, R, A, N, E, the frequency order might change.

 Considering standard English letter frequency after removing C, R, A, N, E:

 Remaining letters by frequency in English: 
 S, T, L, O, M, U, P, D, G, H, I, B, Y, F, V, K, W, X, Z, J, Q.

 So we want to cover the top remaining: S, T, L, O, M, U, P, etc.

 Let's try to include S, T, L, O, U? But in a 5-letter word, it's hard to get all.

 We can choose:

 Option 1: ""SLOUT"" -> but ""SLOUT"" might not be a valid word? Actually, ""LOUTS"" is valid.

 Option 2: ""PIOUS"" -> P, I, O, U, S -> covers S, P, O, U, I. I is a vowel and might be useful.

 But note that we don't have L or T in that.

 How about ""STOMP""? S, T, O, M, P. This has S, T, O, M, P, which are all high-frequency.

 But we don't have U or I? It's okay because we are trying to get more common letters.

 However, ""STOMP"" is valid.

 But note: we must avoid E, A, N, R, C. STOMP: S, T, O, M, P -> none of the excluded.

 So I think ""STOMP"" is a good choice.

 Alternatively, ""SPOUT"" is also valid: S, P, O, U, T.

 Which one? ""STOMP"" avoids U and uses M which is common. ""SPOUT"" gives us U.

 Since we have no information, and U is the 6th most common vowel after A, E, I, O (and A,E are excluded), we might consider U.

 But M is more common than U? In fact, in standard frequency, M is more common than U.

 Let me check (approximate frequencies):
 - T: 9.1, S: 6.5, L: 4.0, O: 7.5, M: 2.4, U: 2.8 -> U is slightly more common than M? Actually, U is more common than M: wait, according to standard frequencies:

 Order: T (9%), A (8%), S (6%), H (6%), I (5%) ... then O (5%), M (3%), U (3%), ... 

 But we removed A and E? Then after A and E are removed, the next vowels are I and O, then U. 

 Since we have to avoid A and E, words without I or U might be possible? But we don't know.

 Given that, we choose a word that covers multiple high-frequency letters.

 I think ""SPOUT"" has S, P, O, U, T -> very high frequency letters: T, S, O, U, and P is also common.

 Alternatively, ""STOMP"" has S, T, O, M, P -> but M might be less common than U? Actually U is about 2.8% and M is 2.4%, so U is slightly more common.

 But also, P is in both.

 I would go with ""SPOUT"" because it gets U and avoids the less common M? But M is common too. Wait, we don't know.

 Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"" but E is excluded -> so invalid.

 Similarly, ""HOMES"" has E -> invalid.

 Then ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H -> valid? Yes, and it has S, P, L, U, H. L is common.

 But in feedback, we want positions as well.

 Since we don't have any constraints on positions, any word without excluded letters is okay.

 I'll decide to use ""SPOUT"". It uses S, P, O, U, T, which are all common and avoids the excluded letters.

 So my second guess is ""SPOUT"".Based on the previous feedback that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word, I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters entirely. I'll select a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, U, P) to maximize information.

My next guess is **SPOUT** (S, P, O, U, T), which contains high-frequency letters while avoiding the excluded set.

<guess>spout</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: spout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) O(-) U(x) T(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the first two guesses:

Guess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters marked 'x', meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.

Guess 2: ""spout"" -> 
  S(x) -> S is not in the word
  P(-) -> P is in the word but in the wrong position
  O(-) -> O is in the word but in the wrong position
  U(x) -> U is not in the word
  T(x) -> T is not in the word

So, from this, we know:
- The secret word contains P and O, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""spout"". Specifically, P was in position 2 and O in position 3, so in the secret word, P is not at position 2 and O is not at position 3.
- Additionally, the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.

We also know the word must be 5 letters and composed of letters not in the excluded set.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

But note: P and O are in the word, so we must include them. The word has exactly 5 letters, so we have 3 more letters to choose from the available set, but we must avoid the excluded ones.

We also know the positions: 
- P is not at position 2 (index 1, if we index from 0).
- O is not at position 3 (index 2).

Now, we need to form a word that includes P and O, and three other letters from the available set, and then assign them to positions such that P is not at position 2 and O is not at position 3.

We should also consider the frequency of the remaining letters to maximize the chance of hitting.

Common letters left: L, I, M, H, G, B, F, Y, etc.

We can try to form words that have P and O, and then use common letters like L, I, H, M, etc.

Possible words:

- We know P and O must be in the word. Let's think of words that have P and O, and avoid the excluded letters.

For example:
- ""POLKA"": P, O, L, K, A -> but A is excluded (from guess1: A(x)), so invalid.
- ""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P -> but P repeated? And Y is allowed. However, we have two P's? The word ""polyp"" has two P's. But we don't know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, in our feedback, for ""spout"", we had only one P and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the secret word had two P's, then we might have seen two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we only guessed one P, we only get one mark. So it's possible that the word has two P's? But we don't have evidence. We should avoid assuming duplicates for now.

But note: the feedback for ""spout"" had only one P marked, so if the secret word has two P's, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no. The feedback is per letter in the guess. Since we only provided one P, we only get one mark for P, even if the word has two. But if the secret word has two P's and we guess one, we only get one mark. Similarly, if we guess two and the word has one, we get one mark and one miss.

But to keep it simple, let's avoid words with duplicate letters for now.

So, words with P and O, and three other distinct letters from the available set.

Available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P (but we already have one P, so we can have another? but we are avoiding duplicates for now), O (already one, so avoid another O?).

But note: we are not forced to avoid duplicates, but to minimize complexity, we can.

So, let's look for words with P, O, and three other distinct letters from {B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}, without repeating P or O.

But P and O are already in the word, so we can have one each.

Now, the word must have 5 letters: so we need three more.

Possible words:

- ""POLKA"": invalid because of A.
- ""POLLY"": P, O, L, L, Y -> has duplicate L? Actually, ""polly"" has two L's. We are avoiding duplicates? But L is a common letter. However, we can consider it if necessary.

But let's avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N and T are excluded (from guess1: N(x) and guess2: T(x)), so invalid.
- ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> U and N excluded, invalid.
- ""PODGY"": P, O, D, G, Y -> D, G, Y are available. So this is a candidate: PODGY.
- ""POKEY"": P, O, K, E, Y -> E excluded, invalid.
- ""PIGMY"": P, I, G, M, Y -> but no O? We must have O. So invalid.
- ""LOOPY"": L, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O and we are avoiding duplicates? Also, O is repeated. But we know O is in the word, but we don't know if it's repeated. However, to avoid complexity, we skip.

Another one: ""PHOTO"": P, H, O, T, O -> T excluded and duplicate O, invalid.

""BOOTY"": B, O, O, T, Y -> T excluded and duplicate O.

""FOOTY"": same, F, O, O, T, Y -> T excluded.

""GOOPY"": G, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O.

""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> duplicate B, and no P? We need P.

We must have P and O.

""PLOY"": too short.

We need 5 letters.

""POLLY"": P, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L. But let's consider if we don't avoid duplicates.

But we are trying to avoid duplicates for now to get more information.

Another word: ""POOCH"": P, O, O, C, H -> C excluded and duplicate O.

""POOH"": too short.

""POINT"" is invalid.

""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> A excluded.

""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> U excluded.

""PODGY"": P, O, D, G, Y -> this seems valid: P, O, D, G, Y. No duplicates, and D, G, Y are available.

Is ""PODGY"" a word? It means a short and fat person, but it's a valid English word.

Another one: ""POXED"": P, O, X, E, D -> E excluded.

""POMMY"": P, O, M, M, Y -> duplicate M.

""POMBE"": P, O, M, B, E -> E excluded.

""POMBO"": not a word.

""POMELO"": too long.

""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P -> duplicate P. We have two P's? The word ""polyp"" has two P's? Actually, ""polyp"" is spelled P-O-L-Y-P, so it has two P's. But we are avoiding duplicates.

But let's consider: we know P is in the word, but we don't know if it appears once or twice. Similarly for O.

However, in the feedback for ""spout"", we had P marked as present, but we don't know if there is another P. So if we guess a word with two P's, we might get more information, but it might be less efficient.

To keep it simple, I'll go with ""PODGY"" for now.

But we have to consider the position constraints:

In ""spout"", P was at position 2 (index 1) and O at position 3 (index 2). So in the secret word, P cannot be at position 1 (index 1) and O cannot be at position 2 (index 2).

In ""PODGY"", the positions are:
P at position 1 (index 0)
O at position 2 (index 1)
D at position 3 (index 2)
G at position 4 (index 3)
Y at position 5 (index 4)

But the constraint: O cannot be at position 2 (index 1) because in ""spout"" it was at index 2 and was marked as present but wrong position? Wait, let me clarify:

In ""spout"":
- Position 1: S (index0) -> x
- Position 2: P (index1) -> - (present but wrong position)
- Position 3: O (index2) -> - (present but wrong position)
- Position 4: U (index3) -> x
- Position 5: T (index4) -> x

So the feedback says:
- P is in the word but not at index1.
- O is in the word but not at index2.

Therefore, in our new guess ""PODGY"":
- We are putting P at index0. This is allowed because the constraint is only that it cannot be at index1. It can be at index0.
- We are putting O at index1. But the constraint says O cannot be at index2? The constraint is that O is not at index2 (which was the position in ""spout""). But in ""PODGY"", we are putting O at index1, which is a different position. So that's allowed? The constraint is only that it is not at the position we guessed (index2). It can be at any other position.

So ""PODGY"" is acceptable.

But note: we are putting O at index1, which is not index2, so that's fine.

Similarly, P at index0 is not index1, so that's fine.

But we are also testing D, G, Y.

Alternatively, we can try other words.

Another word: ""BIPOD"" -> B, I, P, O, D -> but P is at index2? And we have P and O. But the word ""bipod"" has P at index2 and O at index3. But we don't have constraints on P at index2? The constraint for P is that it cannot be at index1. Index2 is allowed. Similarly for O, it cannot be at index2? In ""bipod"", O is at index3, which is not index2, so allowed.

But ""bipod"" is a valid word (a stand for a camera, etc.).

But it has P at index2 and O at index3.

But we don't know if that's correct.

However, we are trying to get more information.

But ""bipod"" uses B, I, P, O, D. All are available.

But we also have to consider that we are testing more common letters? D and I are common.

But ""PODGY"" has D, G, Y. G and Y are less common? But we don't have many options.

Another word: ""GIPON"" -> but N excluded.

""DOLLY"" -> no P.

""DOGMA"" -> A excluded.

""DOZEN"" -> E and N excluded.

""DOILY"" -> D, O, I, L, Y -> but no P? We must have P.

We must have both P and O.

""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> N and E excluded.

""OPTED"": O, P, T, E, D -> T and E excluded.

""OOPED"": O, O, P, E, D -> duplicate O and E excluded.

""PLUMB"": P, L, U, M, B -> U excluded.

""PLUMY"": P, L, U, M, Y -> U excluded.

""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H -> has P, but no O? We need O.

""PYGMY"": P, Y, G, M, Y -> duplicate Y, and no O.

""PODIA"": P, O, D, I, A -> A excluded.

""PODGY"" seems a reasonable choice.

Another one: ""POIND"" - not common.

""POINT"" invalid.

""YMPES"" - not a word.

I think ""PODGY"" is acceptable.

But let's check if there is a word with more common letters.

Common letters left: L, I, H, M, B, D, G, F, etc.

How about ""POLED"": P, O, L, E, D -> E excluded.

""POLER"": P, O, L, E, R -> E and R excluded.

""PILOT"": P, I, L, O, T -> T excluded.

""PILOT"" has T, which is excluded.

""PITHY"": P, I, T, H, Y -> T excluded.

""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> N excluded.

""PICKY"": P, I, C, K, Y -> C excluded.

""PIGMY"" without O.

""BLOOP"": B, L, O, O, P -> duplicate O.

""BLOOM"": B, L, O, O, M -> duplicate O, and no P.

""BLOBS"": B, L, O, B, S -> duplicate B, S excluded.

""BLOOP"" is a word? It might be, but duplicate O.

""FLOPY"": F, L, O, P, Y -> has P and O, and F, L, Y. But ""flopy"" is not a word? The common spelling is ""floppy"", which is 6 letters. ""Flop"" is 4. So invalid.

""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> U excluded.

""GLOOP"": G, L, O, O, P -> duplicate O.

""GLOPY"": not a word.

""HIPPY"": H, I, P, P, Y -> duplicate P, and no O.

""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> duplicate B, no P.

""HOLLY"": H, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L, no P.

""JUMBO"": J, U, M, B, O -> U excluded.

""LOAMY"": L, O, A, M, Y -> A excluded.

""LOOPY"": L, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O.

""MOLLY"": M, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L, no P.

""POPPY"": duplicate P, and no O? P,O,P,P,Y -> has O? P-O-P-P-Y, so O is there, but three P's? Not good.

""PUDDY"": P, U, D, D, Y -> U excluded and duplicate D.

""PULPY"": P, U, L, P, Y -> U excluded and duplicate P.

""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> no O.

""YAPOK"": Y, A, P, O, K -> A excluded.

""YOKED"": Y, O, K, E, D -> E excluded.

""YOLKY"": Y, O, L, K, Y -> duplicate Y, no P.

So after this, ""PODGY"" seems a valid option.

Another word: ""BODGY"" - not common, but ""bodgy"" is a word? Meaning inferior, but I think it's acceptable. But it has B, O, D, G, Y -> no P? We need P.

""PODGY"" has P.

""DOGGY"" has no P or O? D,O,G,G,Y -> has O, but no P and duplicate G.

So I think ""PODGY"" is a good choice.

We can also consider ""DOZYP"" - not a word.

Or ""PYOID"" - not common.

So I'll go with ""PODGY"".

But let's confirm the positions:

In ""PODGY"":
- P at position 1 (index0) -> allowed because the constraint is only that P is not at index1.
- O at position 2 (index1) -> but the constraint for O is that it is not at index2 (from ""spout"" where it was at index2). Here it is at index1, which is different, so allowed.

We are also testing D at index2, G at index3, Y at index4.

If we get feedback, we can narrow down.

But note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.

Alternatively, we might choose a word that has P and O in positions that are not forbidden and that are different from the previous guess to test new positions.

In ""spout"", P was at index1 and O at index2, so we are now trying P at index0 and O at index1.

That's fine.

Another word: ""OPING"" - O, P, I, N, G -> N excluded.

""OPIUM"": O, P, I, U, M -> U excluded.

""OPTIC"": O, P, T, I, C -> T and C excluded.

""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R and T excluded.

""ORDER"": O, R, D, E, R -> multiple exclusions.

I think ""PODGY"" is acceptable.

So I'll guess ""PODGY"".Based on the previous feedback:
- Guess 1 (""crane"") had all letters marked as absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).
- Guess 2 (""spout"") had:
  - S absent (x)
  - P present but wrong position (-)
  - O present but wrong position (-)
  - U absent (x)
  - T absent (x)

This means:
- The secret word contains P and O, but P is not in position 2 (index 1) and O is not in position 3 (index 2).
- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.
- Available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (with O and P confirmed present).

For the next guess:
- Must include P and O (since they are confirmed present).
- P cannot be in position 2, and O cannot in position 3.
- Avoid the excluded letters and prioritize common unused letters (e.g., D, G, Y, L, I) to maximize information.
- Avoid letter repetition for now to test more letters.

After evaluating possible words, ""PODGY"" (P, O, D, G, Y) fits:
- Contains P and O.
- P is in position 1 (index 0), which is allowed (not position 2).
- O is in position 2 (index 1), which is allowed (not position 3).
- Tests new common letters: D, G, Y.
- All letters are distinct and from the available set.

<guess>podgy</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: spout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) O(-) U(x) T(x)
Guess 3: podgy -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) D(x) G(x) Y(✓)
<｜Assistant｜>We have feedback from the third guess: ""podgy"" resulted in:
  P(✓) - correct and in the right position (position 1, index 0)
  O(✓) - correct and in the right position (position 2, index 1)
  D(x) - not in the word
  G(x) - not in the word
  Y(✓) - correct and in the right position (position 5, index 4)

So, we know:
- The secret word has P at position 1 (index 0), O at position 2 (index 1), and Y at position 5 (index 4).
- The secret word does not contain D or G.
- Additionally, from previous guesses, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G.

Now, the secret word pattern is: P _ O _ Y, where the second and fourth positions are unknown.

We need to fill the blanks (positions 3 and 4, index 2 and 3) with letters that are not excluded.

Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G.

Available letters: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note that P and O and Y are already used and in place. However, the word might have duplicate letters? But we don't have evidence of duplicates so far. Since we have P, O, Y in place, and we are missing two letters, we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.

But note: the word has 5 letters, and we have three confirmed: P, O, Y at positions 1,2,5. So positions 3 and 4 (index 2 and 3) are missing.

We need two letters from the available set: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

We also know that the word must be a valid English word.

Possible words of the form P?O??Y:

Let's think of words that start with ""PO"", then a letter, then another letter, and end with ""Y"".

Common patterns:

- POL?Y -> but L is available, but then we have ""POLKY""? Not a word. ""POLY"" is 4 letters. ""POLY"" words are usually longer.

- POM?Y -> ""POM"" is a root, but ""POMBY"" not a word. ""POMMY"" is a word? But we have G excluded and M is available. ""POMMY"" has two M's? P-O-M-M-Y. But we have position 3 (index2) and 4 (index3) to fill. So if we put M at index2 and M at index3, we get ""POMMY"". But is that valid? ""Pommy"" is a slang word for a British person. And it has duplicate M. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates.

But in our feedback, we haven't seen any duplicates yet, so it's possible.

But let's check the feedback for duplicates: in previous guesses, we didn't have duplicates, and the feedback didn't indicate any duplicates. But we can't rule it out.

However, to be safe, let's first try without duplicates.

So, the word is P _ O _ Y, with two distinct letters in the middle.

Possible letters for position 3 (index2) and position 4 (index3): from {B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z}

We need to form a valid word.

Let's list possible words:

- ""POLKY"" -> not a word.
- ""POLLY"" -> P-O-L-L-Y -> but then position 3 (index2) is L and position 4 (index3) is L? That would be duplicate L. And ""POLLY"" is a valid word. But we have duplicate L. Also, we have to check if L is available: yes, L is not excluded.

But if we avoid duplicates, we skip.

- ""POKEY"" -> P-O-K-E-Y -> but E is excluded, invalid.
- ""PONKY"" -> not a word.
- ""POXEY"" -> not common.
- ""POBBY"" -> not a word.
- ""POF?Y"" -> no.
- ""POH?Y"" -> ""POH"" is not common, ""POHLY"" not a word.
- ""POILY"" -> P-O-I-L-Y -> that would be ""POILY"", which might not be a word? But ""oily"" is a word, so ""POILY"" isn't standard.

Another idea: ""POPPY"" -> but that's P-O-P-P-Y, which has duplicate P and we already have P at the start. But the secret word has P at the start, so if there is another P, it would be duplicate. But in ""POPPY"", the second P is at position 3 (index2) and third P at index3? P-O-P-P-Y. So positions: index0: P, index1: O, index2: P, index3: P, index4: Y. But we have O at index1, which is correct, and Y at index4, correct. But we have two more P's. However, we don't know if the word has multiple P's. But in our second guess ""spout"", we had P marked as present but wrong position, and we only guessed one P. If the word had multiple P's, we might have seen multiple marks? But the feedback only marks the letters that are in the word, and for each guessed P, if it is in the word, it gets a mark. Since we guessed one P, we only get one mark. So it's possible that there are multiple P's.

But let's see: if the word is ""POPPY"", then in ""spout"", we had P at index1, which in ""POPPY"" the P's are at index0,2,3. So at index1, there is O, not P. So the P in ""spout"" at index1 was not in the correct position, but there is a P in the word (at index0,2,3). So the feedback for P in ""spout"" would be present but wrong position, which matches. Similarly, in ""podgy"", we had P at index0 correct, and if the word is ""POPPY"", then we also have P at index2 and index3, but we didn't guess them, so we don't know.

But in ""podgy"", we guessed D at index2 and G at index3, which were marked absent. So if the word is ""POPPY"", then at index2 and index3, it should be P, but we guessed D and G, so they are absent, which is consistent. And Y at index4 is correct.

So ""POPPY"" is a candidate? But we have to check the letters: P, O, P, P, Y. But we have three P's? And O and Y.

But the excluded letters: D and G are absent, which is good. And other exclusions: no C,R,A,N,E,S,U,T.

But ""POPPY"" has only three distinct letters: P, O, Y.

But it is a valid word.

However, in our third guess, we had Y at index4 correct, and P at index0 correct, O at index1 correct. So the word must have P at 0, O at 1, and Y at 4. The middle two positions are unknown.

In ""POPPY"", the middle two are both P. So it fits the pattern.

But we need to confirm if it's possible. The feedback for ""podgy"" had D and G absent, which is consistent with ""POPPY"".

But we don't know for sure.

Another candidate: ""POLLY"" - P-O-L-L-Y. This has L at index2 and index3. And L is not excluded. And in ""podgy"", we had D and G absent, which is consistent.

Similarly, ""POLLY"" is a valid word.

Another one: ""JOLTY"" -> but T is excluded.

""MOLLY"" -> M-O-L-L-Y, but no P? We need P at the start.

""HOLLY"" -> no P.

""FILLY"" -> no P.

So for the pattern P_O_ _Y, we have:

- ""POLLY"" (P-O-L-L-Y)
- ""POPPY"" (P-O-P-P-Y)
- ""PALLY"" -> P-A-L-L-Y, but A is excluded.
- ""PULPY"" -> U excluded.
- ""PURPY"" -> not a word.
- ""PIXEY"" -> not common, but ""pixie"" is 5 letters? P-I-X-I-E, but E excluded and not ending with Y.
- ""PICKY"" -> C and K? C excluded, and K is available, but ""PICKY"" is P-I-C-K-Y, C excluded.
- ""PINKY"" -> N excluded.
- ""PIETY"" -> E excluded.
- ""WIFEY"" -> W-I-F-E-Y, E excluded.
- ""WILLY"" -> no P.
- ""BILLY"" -> no P.
- ""HILLY"" -> no P.
- ""LOLLY"" -> no P.
- ""DOLLY"" -> no P.

What about ""POKEY""? E excluded.

""POKY"" is 4 letters.

""POMEY"" -> not a word.

""POMBE"" -> E excluded.

""POMEL"" -> not a word.

""POMLY"" -> not a word.

""PONCY"" -> N excluded? P-O-N-C-Y, N and C excluded.

""POOVY"" -> O at index1 and index2? P-O-O-V-Y, but we have O at index1, and then O at index2? But we need O only at index1. And V is available. But ""POOVY"" is not a word.

""POOTY"" -> O at index1 and index2? and T excluded.

""POOHY"" -> O at index1 and index2? and H is available. ""Poohy"" might be informal, but not standard.

""POOPY"" -> P-O-O-P-Y, which has O at index1 and index2? And P at index0 and index3. But we have Y at index4. So ""POOPY"" is P-O-O-P-Y. Then positions: index0: P, index1: O, index2: O, index3: P, index4: Y. But we have O at index1 (correct) and also at index2? And P at index0 and index3. But in our pattern, we have O at index1, but the word has O at index2 as well? That's allowed, but we don't have a constraint. However, in ""podgy"", we had O at index1, which is correct, but if the word has O at index2, we didn't guess it. But in ""spout"", we had O at index2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word has O at index2, then in ""spout"" when we put O at index2, it should have been marked correct (✓), not wrong position (-). But in guess2, for O, we got (-), meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So if the word had O at index2, then when we guessed O at index2, it should be correct. But it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that the O is not at index2. Therefore, the secret word does not have O at index2. So in ""POOPY"", if it has O at index2, that would contradict the feedback from guess2.

Similarly, for ""POPPY"", it has P at index2 and index3, but in guess2, we had P at index1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word has P at index2, then when we put P at index1, it is wrong position, which is fine, and we didn't test index2 in guess2. But for O in guess2: we put O at index2 and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that the O is not at index2. So the secret word has O, but not at index2. Therefore, in the secret word, O is at index1 (as we now know from guess3) and not at index2.

So for the secret word, position index2 cannot be O. Similarly, position index3 cannot be O? We don't know, but we have O only at index1.

Therefore, in our pattern P _ O _ Y, the first blank is index2 and the second is index3. We know index2 cannot be O (from guess2 feedback), and we now know it is not D or G (from guess3), and not any excluded.

Similarly, index3 cannot be O? We don't have direct constraint, but we know O is only at index1.

But the word might have multiple O's? For example, if the word has O at index1 and index3, that would be allowed. But in guess2, when we put O at index2, it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word has O at index3, then when we put O at index2, it is not at the correct position, so it would be marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent. So it is possible to have O at index3.

But in our current pattern, we have O at index1, and we are looking for index2 and index3.

So index2 cannot be O (because if it were, in guess2 when we put O at index2, it would be correct, but it was marked as wrong position). Therefore, index2 is not O.

Index3 could be O? But we don't have information. However, in guess3, we put D at index2 and G at index3, and they were absent, so index3 is not G, but it could be O.

But if index3 is O, then the word would be P _ O O Y, but with O at index1 and index3? Then the pattern is P-O-?-O-Y? No: positions: index0: P, index1: O, index2: ?, index3: O, index4: Y. But we have O at index1 and index3.

But in the pattern, we have O at index1, and we are to fill index2 and index3. So if index3 is O, then the word has two O's.

But we don't know.

However, let's list possible words:

- ""POLLY"": P-O-L-L-Y -> index2: L, index3: L. L is not excluded. And O is only at index1, so index2 is not O, which is good. And index3 is L, not O.
- ""POPPY"": P-O-P-P-Y -> index2: P, index3: P. P is not excluded, and index2 is not O (it's P), so that's good.
- ""POILY"": P-O-I-L-Y -> index2: I, index3: L. I and L are available. But is ""POILY"" a word? It doesn't seem standard; ""oily"" is a word, but ""poily"" isn't.
- ""POKEY"": not valid due to E.
- ""POMEY"": not a word.
- ""POBBY"": not a word.
- ""POOFY"": P-O-O-F-Y -> but then index2 is O? But we said index2 cannot be O. Because if index2 is O, then in guess2 when we put O at index2, it should be correct, but it was marked as wrong position. So ""POOFY"" has O at index2, which is invalid. Similarly, any word with O at index2 is invalid.
- ""POOPY"": P-O-O-P-Y -> index2 is O, invalid.
- ""POLKY"": not a word.
- ""POWDY"": not a word.
- ""JOWLY"": J-O-W-L-Y -> but no P at start? We have P at start.

We need P at index0.

""POWRY""? not a word.

""POWAY"" - proper noun.

""POXEY"" - not common.

""POZKY"" - not a word.

So the only common words I can think of are ""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"".

Now, we have to choose between them.

We also have other possibilities, like ""PALLY"", but A excluded.

""PUDDY"" - U excluded.

""PURPY"" - not a word.

""PURSY"" - U excluded? P-U-R-S-Y, U,R,S excluded.

""PYGMY"" - no O.

So likely, the word is either ""POLLY"" or ""POPPY"".

To distinguish, we can guess a word that tests L and P in the middle positions.

But we are constrained by the known positions.

We know P at 0, O at 1, Y at 4. So we must have a word that starts with ""PO"" and ends with ""Y"".

We can guess ""POLLY"" or ""POPPY"" directly.

But we have 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4.

If we guess ""POLLY"" and it's wrong, we still have two more guesses.

Similarly for ""POPPY"".

But to maximize information, we could guess a word that has L and P in positions 3 and 4, but we have fixed positions 0,1,4.

Alternatively, we can guess a word that uses other letters to test.

But we have only two positions to fill, and we know the other three.

We can guess ""POLLY"" to test.

But let's see the feedback we would get.

If we guess ""POLLY"":
- P at 0: correct (we know)
- O at 1: correct (we know)
- L at 2: to be determined
- L at 3: to be determined
- Y at 4: correct (we know)

If the word is ""POLLY"", we get all correct.

If the word is ""POPPY"", then at index2 we have L but should be P, so L would be absent? Or if the word has no L, it would be absent. Similarly for index3.

Similarly, if we guess ""POPPY"", and the word is ""POLLY"", then at index2 we have P but should be L, so P would be marked as absent (if no other P) or present if there is another P, but we have P at index0.

In ""POLLY"", there is only one P at index0. So if we guess ""POPPY"" and the word is ""POLLY"", then:
- P at index0: correct
- O at index1: correct
- P at index2: not in the word (since ""POLLY"" has no P at index2, and only one P at index0) -> so marked absent (x)
- P at index3: absent (x)
- Y at index4: correct

So we would get: P(✓) O(✓) P(x) P(x) Y(✓)

Similarly, if we guess ""POLLY"" and the word is ""POPPY"":
- P(✓) O(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓)

So in either case, we get two x's in the middle.

But we can use this to distinguish.

However, we might guess a word that has different letters to test more.

For example, guess a word like ""PALLY"", but A excluded.

""PILKY"" - not a word.

""PILMY"" - not a word.

""PIMPY"" - not common.

""PINNY"" - N excluded.

""PIPPY"" - P-O-?-P-Y, but we need to fill index2 and index3. ""PIPPY"" is P-I-P-P-Y, so index0:P, index1:I, index2:P, index3:P, index4:Y. But we need O at index1, so it must be P-O-?-?-Y. So ""PIPPY"" doesn't have O at index1.

We must have O at index1.

So we are limited.

Another word: ""POLYP"" - P-O-L-Y-P, but then it ends with P, not Y. We need Y at index4.

""POLYP"" is P-O-L-Y-P, so index4 is P, not Y.

So not.

""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"" are the main candidates.

But there is also ""POWDY""? Not a word.

""POWLY""? Not a word.

""POLEY""? P-O-L-E-Y, E excluded.

""POTTY"" - T excluded.

""POTSY"" - T excluded.

""POMEY"" - not a word.

""POMLY"" - not a word.

""PONKY"" - not a word.

""JOLTY"" - T excluded.

""FOLLY"" - no P.

So I think we have to choose between ""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"".

To break the tie, we can consider letter frequency or just guess one.

Since we are at guess 4, we can guess ""POLLY"" and see.

But let's see if there is a word that can test both.

For example, if we guess a word that has L in position 3 and P in position 2, but we have fixed positions.

We can't because the first two and last are fixed.

Another idea: guess a word that is not of the form, but that would violate the known correct positions, which we shouldn't do because we know P, O, Y are fixed.

So we must guess a word that has P at 0, O at 1, Y at 4.

So the only flexibility is positions 2 and 3.

We can guess ""PULPY"" but U excluded.

""PALMY"" - A excluded.

""PELMY"" - E excluded.

""PIMPY"" - not common.

I think we have to go with one of the two.

Let's choose ""POLLY"" because L is more common than having duplicate P.

Or ""POPPY"" is also common.

But in terms of frequency, L is more common than P, but we already have one P.

Perhaps ""POLLY"" is more likely.

But let's look for the answer.

We can guess ""POLLY"".

If it's not, then it must be ""POPPY"".

So I'll guess ""POLLY"".

But in the feedback from guess2, we had O at index2 marked as present but wrong position. If the word is ""POLLY"", then O is only at index1, so when we put O at index2 in guess2, it was wrong position, which is consistent. Similarly for ""POPPY"".

Both are consistent.

So let's try ""POLLY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are not in the secret word.
- **Guess 2 (""spout"")**: 
  - S is absent (x).
  - P is present but in the wrong position (-).
  - O is present but in the wrong position (-).
  - U is absent (x).
  - T is absent (x).
- **Guess 3 (""podgy"")**:
  - P is correct and in the right position (✓) at index 0.
  - O is correct and in the right position (✓) at index 1.
  - D is absent (x).
  - G is absent (x).
  - Y is correct and in the right position (✓) at index 4.

### Key Insights:
- The secret word has the pattern: **P _ O _ Y** (positions: index 0 = P, index 1 = O, index 4 = Y).
- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G.
- Available letters for the unknown positions (index 2 and 3) are: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- From Guess 2, O cannot be at index 2 (since it was marked as present but wrong position when guessed there), so index 2 cannot be O.
- The word must be a valid English word. Common candidates fitting the pattern include ""POLLY"" (P-O-L-L-Y) and ""POPPY"" (P-O-P-P-Y), but other possibilities are limited due to exclusions.

### Reasoning for the Next Guess:
- We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters from the available set that form a valid word.
- ""POLLY"" is a strong candidate because:
  - It uses L (a high-frequency letter) for positions 2 and 3.
  - L is not excluded and hasn't been tested yet.
  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, it provides critical information to distinguish between ""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"" (e.g., if L is absent, ""POPPY"" becomes the likely candidate).
- Given the fixed positions (P, O, Y) and exclusions, ""POLLY"" maximizes the chance of solving or making progress with minimal guesses.

Thus, the next guess is **POLLY**.

I is a vowel and might be useful.\n\n But note that we don\'t have L or T in that.\n\n How about ""STOMP""? S, T, O, M, P.

""STOMP"" avoids U and uses M which is common. ""SPOUT"" gives us U.\n\n Since we have no information, and U is the 6th most common vowel after A, E, I, O (and A,E are excluded), we might consider U.\n\n But M is more common than U? In fact, in standard frequency, M is more common than U.\n\n Let me check (approximate frequencies):\n - T: 9.1, S: 6.5, L: 4.0, O: 7.5, M: 2.4, U: 2.8 -> U is slightly more common than M? Actually, U is more common than M: wait, according to standard frequencies:\n\n Order: T (9%), A (8%), S (6%), H (6%), I (5%) ... then O (5%), M (3%), U (3%), ... \n\n But we removed A and E? Then after A and E are removed, the next vowels are I and O, then U. \n\n Since we have to avoid A and E, words without I or U might be possible? But we don\'t know.\n\n Given that, we choose a word that covers multiple high-frequency letters.\n\n I think ""SPOUT"" has S, P, O, U, T -> very high frequency letters: T, S, O, U, and P is also common.\n\n Alternatively, ""STOMP"" has S, T, O, M, P -> but M might be less common than U? Actually U is about 2.8% and M is 2.4%, so U is slightly more common.\n\n But also, P is in both.\n\n I would go with ""SPOUT"" because it gets U and avoids the less common M? But M is common too. Wait, we don\'t know.\n\n Alternatively, we can use ""HOUSE"" but E is excluded -> so invalid.\n\n Similarly, ""HOMES"" has E -> invalid.\n\n Then ""PLUSH"" - P, L, U, S, H -> valid? Yes, and it has S, P, L, U, H. L is common.\n\n But in feedback, we want positions as well.\n\n Since we don\'t have any constraints on positions, any word without excluded letters is okay.\n\n I\'ll decide to use ""SPOUT"". It uses S, P, O, U, T, which are all common and avoids the excluded letters.\n\n So my second guess is ""SPOUT"".Based on the previous feedback that none of the letters C, R, A, N, or E are in the secret word, I need to choose a new guess that avoids these letters entirely. I\'ll select a word with common unused letters (e.g., S, T, O, U, P) to maximize information.\n\nMy next guess is **SPOUT** (S, P, O, U, T), which contains high-frequency letters while avoiding the excluded set.\n\n<guess>spout</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) O(-) U(x) T(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the first two guesses:\n\nGuess 1: ""crane"" -> all letters marked \'x\', meaning none of C, R, A, N, E are in the secret word.\n\nGuess 2: ""spout"" -> \n  S(x) -> S is not in the word\n  P(-) -> P is in the word but in the wrong position\n  O(-) -> O is in the word but in the wrong position\n  U(x) -> U is not in the word\n  T(x) -> T is not in the word\n\nSo, from this, we know:\n- The secret word contains P and O, but not in the positions they were guessed in ""spout"". Specifically, P was in position 2 and O in position 3, so in the secret word, P is not at position 2 and O is not at position 3.\n- Additionally, the secret word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.\n\nWe also know the word must be 5 letters and composed of letters not in the excluded set.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.\n\nAvailable letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, O, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nBut note: P and O are in the word, so we must include them. The word has exactly 5 letters, so we have 3 more letters to choose from the available set, but we must avoid the excluded ones.\n\nWe also know the positions: \n- P is not at position 2 (index 1, if we index from 0).\n- O is not at position 3 (index 2).\n\nNow, we need to form a word that includes P and O, and three other letters from the available set, and then assign them to positions such that P is not at position 2 and O is not at position 3.\n\nWe should also consider the frequency of the remaining letters to maximize the chance of hitting.\n\nCommon letters left: L, I, M, H, G, B, F, Y, etc.\n\nWe can try to form words that have P and O, and then use common letters like L, I, H, M, etc.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- We know P and O must be in the word. Let\'s think of words that have P and O, and avoid the excluded letters.\n\nFor example:\n- ""POLKA"": P, O, L, K, A -> but A is excluded (from guess1: A(x)), so invalid.\n- ""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P -> but P repeated? And Y is allowed. However, we have two P\'s? The word ""polyp"" has two P\'s. But we don\'t know if the secret word has repeated letters. However, in our feedback, for ""spout"", we had only one P and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the secret word had two P\'s, then we might have seen two marks? But the feedback only marks each occurrence. Since we only guessed one P, we only get one mark. So it\'s possible that the word has two P\'s? But we don\'t have evidence. We should avoid assuming duplicates for now.\n\nBut note: the feedback for ""spout"" had only one P marked, so if the secret word has two P\'s, then we would have seen two marks? Actually, no. The feedback is per letter in the guess. Since we only provided one P, we only get one mark for P, even if the word has two. But if the secret word has two P\'s and we guess one, we only get one mark. Similarly, if we guess two and the word has one, we get one mark and one miss.\n\nBut to keep it simple, let\'s avoid words with duplicate letters for now.\n\nSo, words with P and O, and three other distinct letters from the available set.\n\nAvailable: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P (but we already have one P, so we can have another? but we are avoiding duplicates for now), O (already one, so avoid another O?).\n\nBut note: we are not forced to avoid duplicates, but to minimize complexity, we can.\n\nSo, let\'s look for words with P, O, and three other distinct letters from {B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z}, without repeating P or O.\n\nBut P and O are already in the word, so we can have one each.\n\nNow, the word must have 5 letters: so we need three more.\n\nPossible words:\n\n- ""POLKA"": invalid because of A.\n- ""POLLY"": P, O, L, L, Y -> has duplicate L? Actually, ""polly"" has two L\'s. We are avoiding duplicates? But L is a common letter. However, we can consider it if necessary.\n\nBut let\'s avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\n- ""POINT"": P, O, I, N, T -> but N and T are excluded (from guess1: N(x) and guess2: T(x)), so invalid.\n- ""POUND"": P, O, U, N, D -> U and N excluded, invalid.\n- ""PODGY"": P, O, D, G, Y -> D, G, Y are available. So this is a candidate: PODGY.\n- ""POKEY"": P, O, K, E, Y -> E excluded, invalid.\n- ""PIGMY"": P, I, G, M, Y -> but no O? We must have O. So invalid.\n- ""LOOPY"": L, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O and we are avoiding duplicates? Also, O is repeated. But we know O is in the word, but we don\'t know if it\'s repeated. However, to avoid complexity, we skip.\n\nAnother one: ""PHOTO"": P, H, O, T, O -> T excluded and duplicate O, invalid.\n\n""BOOTY"": B, O, O, T, Y -> T excluded and duplicate O.\n\n""FOOTY"": same, F, O, O, T, Y -> T excluded.\n\n""GOOPY"": G, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O.\n\n""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> duplicate B, and no P? We need P.\n\nWe must have P and O.\n\n""PLOY"": too short.\n\nWe need 5 letters.\n\n""POLLY"": P, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L. But let\'s consider if we don\'t avoid duplicates.\n\nBut we are trying to avoid duplicates for now to get more information.\n\nAnother word: ""POOCH"": P, O, O, C, H -> C excluded and duplicate O.\n\n""POOH"": too short.\n\n""POINT"" is invalid.\n\n""PADDY"": P, A, D, D, Y -> A excluded.\n\n""PUDGY"": P, U, D, G, Y -> U excluded.\n\n""PODGY"": P, O, D, G, Y -> this seems valid: P, O, D, G, Y. No duplicates, and D, G, Y are available.\n\nIs ""PODGY"" a word? It means a short and fat person, but it\'s a valid English word.\n\nAnother one: ""POXED"": P, O, X, E, D -> E excluded.\n\n""POMMY"": P, O, M, M, Y -> duplicate M.\n\n""POMBE"": P, O, M, B, E -> E excluded.\n\n""POMBO"": not a word.\n\n""POMELO"": too long.\n\n""POLYP"": P, O, L, Y, P -> duplicate P. We have two P\'s? The word ""polyp"" has two P\'s? Actually, ""polyp"" is spelled P-O-L-Y-P, so it has two P\'s. But we are avoiding duplicates.\n\nBut let\'s consider: we know P is in the word, but we don\'t know if it appears once or twice. Similarly for O.\n\nHowever, in the feedback for ""spout"", we had P marked as present, but we don\'t know if there is another P. So if we guess a word with two P\'s, we might get more information, but it might be less efficient.\n\nTo keep it simple, I\'ll go with ""PODGY"" for now.\n\nBut we have to consider the position constraints:\n\nIn ""spout"", P was at position 2 (index 1) and O at position 3 (index 2). So in the secret word, P cannot be at position 1 (index 1) and O cannot be at position 2 (index 2).\n\nIn ""PODGY"", the positions are:\nP at position 1 (index 0)\nO at position 2 (index 1)\nD at position 3 (index 2)\nG at position 4 (index 3)\nY at position 5 (index 4)\n\nBut the constraint: O cannot be at position 2 (index 1) because in ""spout"" it was at index 2 and was marked as present but wrong position? Wait, let me clarify:\n\nIn ""spout"":\n- Position 1: S (index0) -> x\n- Position 2: P (index1) -> - (present but wrong position)\n- Position 3: O (index2) -> - (present but wrong position)\n- Position 4: U (index3) -> x\n- Position 5: T (index4) -> x\n\nSo the feedback says:\n- P is in the word but not at index1.\n- O is in the word but not at index2.\n\nTherefore, in our new guess ""PODGY"":\n- We are putting P at index0. This is allowed because the constraint is only that it cannot be at index1. It can be at index0.\n- We are putting O at index1. But the constraint says O cannot be at index2? The constraint is that O is not at index2 (which was the position in ""spout""). But in ""PODGY"", we are putting O at index1, which is a different position. So that\'s allowed? The constraint is only that it is not at the position we guessed (index2). It can be at any other position.\n\nSo ""PODGY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut note: we are putting O at index1, which is not index2, so that\'s fine.\n\nSimilarly, P at index0 is not index1, so that\'s fine.\n\nBut we are also testing D, G, Y.\n\nAlternatively, we can try other words.\n\nAnother word: ""BIPOD"" -> B, I, P, O, D -> but P is at index2? And we have P and O. But the word ""bipod"" has P at index2 and O at index3. But we don\'t have constraints on P at index2? The constraint for P is that it cannot be at index1. Index2 is allowed. Similarly for O, it cannot be at index2? In ""bipod"", O is at index3, which is not index2, so allowed.\n\nBut ""bipod"" is a valid word (a stand for a camera, etc.).\n\nBut it has P at index2 and O at index3.\n\nBut we don\'t know if that\'s correct.\n\nHowever, we are trying to get more information.\n\nBut ""bipod"" uses B, I, P, O, D. All are available.\n\nBut we also have to consider that we are testing more common letters? D and I are common.\n\nBut ""PODGY"" has D, G, Y. G and Y are less common? But we don\'t have many options.\n\nAnother word: ""GIPON"" -> but N excluded.\n\n""DOLLY"" -> no P.\n\n""DOGMA"" -> A excluded.\n\n""DOZEN"" -> E and N excluded.\n\n""DOILY"" -> D, O, I, L, Y -> but no P? We must have P.\n\nWe must have both P and O.\n\n""OPINE"": O, P, I, N, E -> N and E excluded.\n\n""OPTED"": O, P, T, E, D -> T and E excluded.\n\n""OOPED"": O, O, P, E, D -> duplicate O and E excluded.\n\n""PLUMB"": P, L, U, M, B -> U excluded.\n\n""PLUMY"": P, L, U, M, Y -> U excluded.\n\n""GLYPH"": G, L, Y, P, H -> has P, but no O? We need O.\n\n""PYGMY"": P, Y, G, M, Y -> duplicate Y, and no O.\n\n""PODIA"": P, O, D, I, A -> A excluded.\n\n""PODGY"" seems a reasonable choice.\n\nAnother one: ""POIND"" - not common.\n\n""POINT"" invalid.\n\n""YMPES"" - not a word.\n\nI think ""PODGY"" is acceptable.\n\nBut let\'s check if there is a word with more common letters.\n\nCommon letters left: L, I, H, M, B, D, G, F, etc.\n\nHow about ""POLED"": P, O, L, E, D -> E excluded.\n\n""POLER"": P, O, L, E, R -> E and R excluded.\n\n""PILOT"": P, I, L, O, T -> T excluded.\n\n""PILOT"" has T, which is excluded.\n\n""PITHY"": P, I, T, H, Y -> T excluded.\n\n""PINKY"": P, I, N, K, Y -> N excluded.\n\n""PICKY"": P, I, C, K, Y -> C excluded.\n\n""PIGMY"" without O.\n\n""BLOOP"": B, L, O, O, P -> duplicate O.\n\n""BLOOM"": B, L, O, O, M -> duplicate O, and no P.\n\n""BLOBS"": B, L, O, B, S -> duplicate B, S excluded.\n\n""BLOOP"" is a word? It might be, but duplicate O.\n\n""FLOPY"": F, L, O, P, Y -> has P and O, and F, L, Y. But ""flopy"" is not a word? The common spelling is ""floppy"", which is 6 letters. ""Flop"" is 4. So invalid.\n\n""FLUID"": F, L, U, I, D -> U excluded.\n\n""GLOOP"": G, L, O, O, P -> duplicate O.\n\n""GLOPY"": not a word.\n\n""HIPPY"": H, I, P, P, Y -> duplicate P, and no O.\n\n""HOBBY"": H, O, B, B, Y -> duplicate B, no P.\n\n""HOLLY"": H, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L, no P.\n\n""JUMBO"": J, U, M, B, O -> U excluded.\n\n""LOAMY"": L, O, A, M, Y -> A excluded.\n\n""LOOPY"": L, O, O, P, Y -> duplicate O.\n\n""MOLLY"": M, O, L, L, Y -> duplicate L, no P.\n\n""POPPY"": duplicate P, and no O? P,O,P,P,Y -> has O? P-O-P-P-Y, so O is there, but three P\'s? Not good.\n\n""PUDDY"": P, U, D, D, Y -> U excluded and duplicate D.\n\n""PULPY"": P, U, L, P, Y -> U excluded and duplicate P.\n\n""WIMPY"": W, I, M, P, Y -> no O.\n\n""YAPOK"": Y, A, P, O, K -> A excluded.\n\n""YOKED"": Y, O, K, E, D -> E excluded.\n\n""YOLKY"": Y, O, L, K, Y -> duplicate Y, no P.\n\nSo after this, ""PODGY"" seems a valid option.\n\nAnother word: ""BODGY"" - not common, but ""bodgy"" is a word? Meaning inferior, but I think it\'s acceptable. But it has B, O, D, G, Y -> no P? We need P.\n\n""PODGY"" has P.\n\n""DOGGY"" has no P or O? D,O,G,G,Y -> has O, but no P and duplicate G.\n\nSo I think ""PODGY"" is a good choice.\n\nWe can also consider ""DOZYP"" - not a word.\n\nOr ""PYOID"" - not common.\n\nSo I\'ll go with ""PODGY"".\n\nBut let\'s confirm the positions:\n\nIn ""PODGY"":\n- P at position 1 (index0) -> allowed because the constraint is only that P is not at index1.\n- O at position 2 (index1) -> but the constraint for O is that it is not at index2 (from ""spout"" where it was at index2). Here it is at index1, which is different, so allowed.\n\nWe are also testing D at index2, G at index3, Y at index4.\n\nIf we get feedback, we can narrow down.\n\nBut note: we have only 6 guesses, and we are on guess 3.\n\nAlternatively, we might choose a word that has P and O in positions that are not forbidden and that are different from the previous guess to test new positions.\n\nIn ""spout"", P was at index1 and O at index2, so we are now trying P at index0 and O at index1.\n\nThat\'s fine.\n\nAnother word: ""OPING"" - O, P, I, N, G -> N excluded.\n\n""OPIUM"": O, P, I, U, M -> U excluded.\n\n""OPTIC"": O, P, T, I, C -> T and C excluded.\n\n""ORBIT"": O, R, B, I, T -> R and T excluded.\n\n""ORDER"": O, R, D, E, R -> multiple exclusions.\n\nI think ""PODGY"" is acceptable.\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""PODGY"".Based on the previous feedback:\n- Guess 1 (""crane"") had all letters marked as absent (C, R, A, N, E are not in the word).\n- Guess 2 (""spout"") had:\n  - S absent (x)\n  - P present but wrong position (-)\n  - O present but wrong position (-)\n  - U absent (x)\n  - T absent (x)\n\nThis means:\n- The secret word contains P and O, but P is not in position 2 (index 1) and O is not in position 3 (index 2).\n- The word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T.\n- Available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z (with O and P confirmed present).\n\nFor the next guess:\n- Must include P and O (since they are confirmed present).\n- P cannot be in position 2, and O cannot in position 3.\n- Avoid the excluded letters and prioritize common unused letters (e.g., D, G, Y, L, I) to maximize information.\n- Avoid letter repetition for now to test more letters.\n\nAfter evaluating possible words, ""PODGY"" (P, O, D, G, Y) fits:\n- Contains P and O.\n- P is in position 1 (index 0), which is allowed (not position 2).\n- O is in position 2 (index 1), which is allowed (not position 3).\n- Tests new common letters: D, G, Y.\n- All letters are distinct and from the available set.\n\n<guess>podgy</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) O(-) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: podgy -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) D(x) G(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'We have feedback from the third guess: ""podgy"" resulted in:\n  P(✓) - correct and in the right position (position 1, index 0)\n  O(✓) - correct and in the right position (position 2, index 1)\n  D(x) - not in the word\n  G(x) - not in the word\n  Y(✓) - correct and in the right position (position 5, index 4)\n\nSo, we know:\n- The secret word has P at position 1 (index 0), O at position 2 (index 1), and Y at position 5 (index 4).\n- The secret word does not contain D or G.\n- Additionally, from previous guesses, we know the word does not contain: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G.\n\nNow, the secret word pattern is: P _ O _ Y, where the second and fourth positions are unknown.\n\nWe need to fill the blanks (positions 3 and 4, index 2 and 3) with letters that are not excluded.\n\nExcluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G.\n\nAvailable letters: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note that P and O and Y are already used and in place. However, the word might have duplicate letters? But we don\'t have evidence of duplicates so far. Since we have P, O, Y in place, and we are missing two letters, we should avoid duplicates for now to maximize information.\n\nBut note: the word has 5 letters, and we have three confirmed: P, O, Y at positions 1,2,5. So positions 3 and 4 (index 2 and 3) are missing.\n\nWe need two letters from the available set: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n\nWe also know that the word must be a valid English word.\n\nPossible words of the form P?O??Y:\n\nLet\'s think of words that start with ""PO"", then a letter, then another letter, and end with ""Y"".\n\nCommon patterns:\n\n- POL?Y -> but L is available, but then we have ""POLKY""? Not a word. ""POLY"" is 4 letters. ""POLY"" words are usually longer.\n\n- POM?Y -> ""POM"" is a root, but ""POMBY"" not a word. ""POMMY"" is a word? But we have G excluded and M is available. ""POMMY"" has two M\'s? P-O-M-M-Y. But we have position 3 (index2) and 4 (index3) to fill. So if we put M at index2 and M at index3, we get ""POMMY"". But is that valid? ""Pommy"" is a slang word for a British person. And it has duplicate M. But we don\'t know if duplicates are allowed? The secret word might have duplicates.\n\nBut in our feedback, we haven\'t seen any duplicates yet, so it\'s possible.\n\nBut let\'s check the feedback for duplicates: in previous guesses, we didn\'t have duplicates, and the feedback didn\'t indicate any duplicates. But we can\'t rule it out.\n\nHowever, to be safe, let\'s first try without duplicates.\n\nSo, the word is P _ O _ Y, with two distinct letters in the middle.\n\nPossible letters for position 3 (index2) and position 4 (index3): from {B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z}\n\nWe need to form a valid word.\n\nLet\'s list possible words:\n\n- ""POLKY"" -> not a word.\n- ""POLLY"" -> P-O-L-L-Y -> but then position 3 (index2) is L and position 4 (index3) is L? That would be duplicate L. And ""POLLY"" is a valid word. But we have duplicate L. Also, we have to check if L is available: yes, L is not excluded.\n\nBut if we avoid duplicates, we skip.\n\n- ""POKEY"" -> P-O-K-E-Y -> but E is excluded, invalid.\n- ""PONKY"" -> not a word.\n- ""POXEY"" -> not common.\n- ""POBBY"" -> not a word.\n- ""POF?Y"" -> no.\n- ""POH?Y"" -> ""POH"" is not common, ""POHLY"" not a word.\n- ""POILY"" -> P-O-I-L-Y -> that would be ""POILY"", which might not be a word? But ""oily"" is a word, so ""POILY"" isn\'t standard.\n\nAnother idea: ""POPPY"" -> but that\'s P-O-P-P-Y, which has duplicate P and we already have P at the start. But the secret word has P at the start, so if there is another P, it would be duplicate. But in ""POPPY"", the second P is at position 3 (index2) and third P at index3? P-O-P-P-Y. So positions: index0: P, index1: O, index2: P, index3: P, index4: Y. But we have O at index1, which is correct, and Y at index4, correct. But we have two more P\'s. However, we don\'t know if the word has multiple P\'s. But in our second guess ""spout"", we had P marked as present but wrong position, and we only guessed one P. If the word had multiple P\'s, we might have seen multiple marks? But the feedback only marks the letters that are in the word, and for each guessed P, if it is in the word, it gets a mark. Since we guessed one P, we only get one mark. So it\'s possible that there are multiple P\'s.\n\nBut let\'s see: if the word is ""POPPY"", then in ""spout"", we had P at index1, which in ""POPPY"" the P\'s are at index0,2,3. So at index1, there is O, not P. So the P in ""spout"" at index1 was not in the correct position, but there is a P in the word (at index0,2,3). So the feedback for P in ""spout"" would be present but wrong position, which matches. Similarly, in ""podgy"", we had P at index0 correct, and if the word is ""POPPY"", then we also have P at index2 and index3, but we didn\'t guess them, so we don\'t know.\n\nBut in ""podgy"", we guessed D at index2 and G at index3, which were marked absent. So if the word is ""POPPY"", then at index2 and index3, it should be P, but we guessed D and G, so they are absent, which is consistent. And Y at index4 is correct.\n\nSo ""POPPY"" is a candidate? But we have to check the letters: P, O, P, P, Y. But we have three P\'s? And O and Y.\n\nBut the excluded letters: D and G are absent, which is good. And other exclusions: no C,R,A,N,E,S,U,T.\n\nBut ""POPPY"" has only three distinct letters: P, O, Y.\n\nBut it is a valid word.\n\nHowever, in our third guess, we had Y at index4 correct, and P at index0 correct, O at index1 correct. So the word must have P at 0, O at 1, and Y at 4. The middle two positions are unknown.\n\nIn ""POPPY"", the middle two are both P. So it fits the pattern.\n\nBut we need to confirm if it\'s possible. The feedback for ""podgy"" had D and G absent, which is consistent with ""POPPY"".\n\nBut we don\'t know for sure.\n\nAnother candidate: ""POLLY"" - P-O-L-L-Y. This has L at index2 and index3. And L is not excluded. And in ""podgy"", we had D and G absent, which is consistent.\n\nSimilarly, ""POLLY"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother one: ""JOLTY"" -> but T is excluded.\n\n""MOLLY"" -> M-O-L-L-Y, but no P? We need P at the start.\n\n""HOLLY"" -> no P.\n\n""FILLY"" -> no P.\n\nSo for the pattern P_O_ _Y, we have:\n\n- ""POLLY"" (P-O-L-L-Y)\n- ""POPPY"" (P-O-P-P-Y)\n- ""PALLY"" -> P-A-L-L-Y, but A is excluded.\n- ""PULPY"" -> U excluded.\n- ""PURPY"" -> not a word.\n- ""PIXEY"" -> not common, but ""pixie"" is 5 letters? P-I-X-I-E, but E excluded and not ending with Y.\n- ""PICKY"" -> C and K? C excluded, and K is available, but ""PICKY"" is P-I-C-K-Y, C excluded.\n- ""PINKY"" -> N excluded.\n- ""PIETY"" -> E excluded.\n- ""WIFEY"" -> W-I-F-E-Y, E excluded.\n- ""WILLY"" -> no P.\n- ""BILLY"" -> no P.\n- ""HILLY"" -> no P.\n- ""LOLLY"" -> no P.\n- ""DOLLY"" -> no P.\n\nWhat about ""POKEY""? E excluded.\n\n""POKY"" is 4 letters.\n\n""POMEY"" -> not a word.\n\n""POMBE"" -> E excluded.\n\n""POMEL"" -> not a word.\n\n""POMLY"" -> not a word.\n\n""PONCY"" -> N excluded? P-O-N-C-Y, N and C excluded.\n\n""POOVY"" -> O at index1 and index2? P-O-O-V-Y, but we have O at index1, and then O at index2? But we need O only at index1. And V is available. But ""POOVY"" is not a word.\n\n""POOTY"" -> O at index1 and index2? and T excluded.\n\n""POOHY"" -> O at index1 and index2? and H is available. ""Poohy"" might be informal, but not standard.\n\n""POOPY"" -> P-O-O-P-Y, which has O at index1 and index2? And P at index0 and index3. But we have Y at index4. So ""POOPY"" is P-O-O-P-Y. Then positions: index0: P, index1: O, index2: O, index3: P, index4: Y. But we have O at index1 (correct) and also at index2? And P at index0 and index3. But in our pattern, we have O at index1, but the word has O at index2 as well? That\'s allowed, but we don\'t have a constraint. However, in ""podgy"", we had O at index1, which is correct, but if the word has O at index2, we didn\'t guess it. But in ""spout"", we had O at index2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word has O at index2, then in ""spout"" when we put O at index2, it should have been marked correct (✓), not wrong position (-). But in guess2, for O, we got (-), meaning it is in the word but not at that position. So if the word had O at index2, then when we guessed O at index2, it should be correct. But it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that the O is not at index2. Therefore, the secret word does not have O at index2. So in ""POOPY"", if it has O at index2, that would contradict the feedback from guess2.\n\nSimilarly, for ""POPPY"", it has P at index2 and index3, but in guess2, we had P at index1 and it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word has P at index2, then when we put P at index1, it is wrong position, which is fine, and we didn\'t test index2 in guess2. But for O in guess2: we put O at index2 and it was marked as present but wrong position, meaning that the O is not at index2. So the secret word has O, but not at index2. Therefore, in the secret word, O is at index1 (as we now know from guess3) and not at index2.\n\nSo for the secret word, position index2 cannot be O. Similarly, position index3 cannot be O? We don\'t know, but we have O only at index1.\n\nTherefore, in our pattern P _ O _ Y, the first blank is index2 and the second is index3. We know index2 cannot be O (from guess2 feedback), and we now know it is not D or G (from guess3), and not any excluded.\n\nSimilarly, index3 cannot be O? We don\'t have direct constraint, but we know O is only at index1.\n\nBut the word might have multiple O\'s? For example, if the word has O at index1 and index3, that would be allowed. But in guess2, when we put O at index2, it was marked as present but wrong position. If the word has O at index3, then when we put O at index2, it is not at the correct position, so it would be marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent. So it is possible to have O at index3.\n\nBut in our current pattern, we have O at index1, and we are looking for index2 and index3.\n\nSo index2 cannot be O (because if it were, in guess2 when we put O at index2, it would be correct, but it was marked as wrong position). Therefore, index2 is not O.\n\nIndex3 could be O? But we don\'t have information. However, in guess3, we put D at index2 and G at index3, and they were absent, so index3 is not G, but it could be O.\n\nBut if index3 is O, then the word would be P _ O O Y, but with O at index1 and index3? Then the pattern is P-O-?-O-Y? No: positions: index0: P, index1: O, index2: ?, index3: O, index4: Y. But we have O at index1 and index3.\n\nBut in the pattern, we have O at index1, and we are to fill index2 and index3. So if index3 is O, then the word has two O\'s.\n\nBut we don\'t know.\n\nHowever, let\'s list possible words:\n\n- ""POLLY"": P-O-L-L-Y -> index2: L, index3: L. L is not excluded. And O is only at index1, so index2 is not O, which is good. And index3 is L, not O.\n- ""POPPY"": P-O-P-P-Y -> index2: P, index3: P. P is not excluded, and index2 is not O (it\'s P), so that\'s good.\n- ""POILY"": P-O-I-L-Y -> index2: I, index3: L. I and L are available. But is ""POILY"" a word? It doesn\'t seem standard; ""oily"" is a word, but ""poily"" isn\'t.\n- ""POKEY"": not valid due to E.\n- ""POMEY"": not a word.\n- ""POBBY"": not a word.\n- ""POOFY"": P-O-O-F-Y -> but then index2 is O? But we said index2 cannot be O. Because if index2 is O, then in guess2 when we put O at index2, it should be correct, but it was marked as wrong position. So ""POOFY"" has O at index2, which is invalid. Similarly, any word with O at index2 is invalid.\n- ""POOPY"": P-O-O-P-Y -> index2 is O, invalid.\n- ""POLKY"": not a word.\n- ""POWDY"": not a word.\n- ""JOWLY"": J-O-W-L-Y -> but no P at start? We have P at start.\n\nWe need P at index0.\n\n""POWRY""? not a word.\n\n""POWAY"" - proper noun.\n\n""POXEY"" - not common.\n\n""POZKY"" - not a word.\n\nSo the only common words I can think of are ""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"".\n\nNow, we have to choose between them.\n\nWe also have other possibilities, like ""PALLY"", but A excluded.\n\n""PUDDY"" - U excluded.\n\n""PURPY"" - not a word.\n\n""PURSY"" - U excluded? P-U-R-S-Y, U,R,S excluded.\n\n""PYGMY"" - no O.\n\nSo likely, the word is either ""POLLY"" or ""POPPY"".\n\nTo distinguish, we can guess a word that tests L and P in the middle positions.\n\nBut we are constrained by the known positions.\n\nWe know P at 0, O at 1, Y at 4. So we must have a word that starts with ""PO"" and ends with ""Y"".\n\nWe can guess ""POLLY"" or ""POPPY"" directly.\n\nBut we have 6 guesses, and we are on guess 4.\n\nIf we guess ""POLLY"" and it\'s wrong, we still have two more guesses.\n\nSimilarly for ""POPPY"".\n\nBut to maximize information, we could guess a word that has L and P in positions 3 and 4, but we have fixed positions 0,1,4.\n\nAlternatively, we can guess a word that uses other letters to test.\n\nBut we have only two positions to fill, and we know the other three.\n\nWe can guess ""POLLY"" to test.\n\nBut let\'s see the feedback we would get.\n\nIf we guess ""POLLY"":\n- P at 0: correct (we know)\n- O at 1: correct (we know)\n- L at 2: to be determined\n- L at 3: to be determined\n- Y at 4: correct (we know)\n\nIf the word is ""POLLY"", we get all correct.\n\nIf the word is ""POPPY"", then at index2 we have L but should be P, so L would be absent? Or if the word has no L, it would be absent. Similarly for index3.\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""POPPY"", and the word is ""POLLY"", then at index2 we have P but should be L, so P would be marked as absent (if no other P) or present if there is another P, but we have P at index0.\n\nIn ""POLLY"", there is only one P at index0. So if we guess ""POPPY"" and the word is ""POLLY"", then:\n- P at index0: correct\n- O at index1: correct\n- P at index2: not in the word (since ""POLLY"" has no P at index2, and only one P at index0) -> so marked absent (x)\n- P at index3: absent (x)\n- Y at index4: correct\n\nSo we would get: P(✓) O(✓) P(x) P(x) Y(✓)\n\nSimilarly, if we guess ""POLLY"" and the word is ""POPPY"":\n- P(✓) O(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓)\n\nSo in either case, we get two x\'s in the middle.\n\nBut we can use this to distinguish.\n\nHowever, we might guess a word that has different letters to test more.\n\nFor example, guess a word like ""PALLY"", but A excluded.\n\n""PILKY"" - not a word.\n\n""PILMY"" - not a word.\n\n""PIMPY"" - not common.\n\n""PINNY"" - N excluded.\n\n""PIPPY"" - P-O-?-P-Y, but we need to fill index2 and index3. ""PIPPY"" is P-I-P-P-Y, so index0:P, index1:I, index2:P, index3:P, index4:Y. But we need O at index1, so it must be P-O-?-?-Y. So ""PIPPY"" doesn\'t have O at index1.\n\nWe must have O at index1.\n\nSo we are limited.\n\nAnother word: ""POLYP"" - P-O-L-Y-P, but then it ends with P, not Y. We need Y at index4.\n\n""POLYP"" is P-O-L-Y-P, so index4 is P, not Y.\n\nSo not.\n\n""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"" are the main candidates.\n\nBut there is also ""POWDY""? Not a word.\n\n""POWLY""? Not a word.\n\n""POLEY""? P-O-L-E-Y, E excluded.\n\n""POTTY"" - T excluded.\n\n""POTSY"" - T excluded.\n\n""POMEY"" - not a word.\n\n""POMLY"" - not a word.\n\n""PONKY"" - not a word.\n\n""JOLTY"" - T excluded.\n\n""FOLLY"" - no P.\n\nSo I think we have to choose between ""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"".\n\nTo break the tie, we can consider letter frequency or just guess one.\n\nSince we are at guess 4, we can guess ""POLLY"" and see.\n\nBut let\'s see if there is a word that can test both.\n\nFor example, if we guess a word that has L in position 3 and P in position 2, but we have fixed positions.\n\nWe can\'t because the first two and last are fixed.\n\nAnother idea: guess a word that is not of the form, but that would violate the known correct positions, which we shouldn\'t do because we know P, O, Y are fixed.\n\nSo we must guess a word that has P at 0, O at 1, Y at 4.\n\nSo the only flexibility is positions 2 and 3.\n\nWe can guess ""PULPY"" but U excluded.\n\n""PALMY"" - A excluded.\n\n""PELMY"" - E excluded.\n\n""PIMPY"" - not common.\n\nI think we have to go with one of the two.\n\nLet\'s choose ""POLLY"" because L is more common than having duplicate P.\n\nOr ""POPPY"" is also common.\n\nBut in terms of frequency, L is more common than P, but we already have one P.\n\nPerhaps ""POLLY"" is more likely.\n\nBut let\'s look for the answer.\n\nWe can guess ""POLLY"".\n\nIf it\'s not, then it must be ""POPPY"".\n\nSo I\'ll guess ""POLLY"".\n\nBut in the feedback from guess2, we had O at index2 marked as present but wrong position. If the word is ""POLLY"", then O is only at index1, so when we put O at index2 in guess2, it was wrong position, which is consistent. Similarly for ""POPPY"".\n\nBoth are consistent.\n\nSo let\'s try ""POLLY"".Based on the feedback from previous guesses:\n\n- **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent (x), so they are not in the secret word.\n- **Guess 2 (""spout"")**: \n  - S is absent (x).\n  - P is present but in the wrong position (-).\n  - O is present but in the wrong position (-).\n  - U is absent (x).\n  - T is absent (x).\n- **Guess 3 (""podgy"")**:\n  - P is correct and in the right position (✓) at index 0.\n  - O is correct and in the right position (✓) at index 1.\n  - D is absent (x).\n  - G is absent (x).\n  - Y is correct and in the right position (✓) at index 4.\n\n### Key Insights:\n- The secret word has the pattern: **P _ O _ Y** (positions: index 0 = P, index 1 = O, index 4 = Y).\n- Confirmed absent letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G.\n- Available letters for the unknown positions (index 2 and 3) are: B, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.\n- From Guess 2, O cannot be at index 2 (since it was marked as present but wrong position when guessed there), so index 2 cannot be O.\n- The word must be a valid English word. Common candidates fitting the pattern include ""POLLY"" (P-O-L-L-Y) and ""POPPY"" (P-O-P-P-Y), but other possibilities are limited due to exclusions.\n\n### Reasoning for the Next Guess:\n- We need to fill positions 2 and 3 with letters from the available set that form a valid word.\n- ""POLLY"" is a strong candidate because:\n  - It uses L (a high-frequency letter) for positions 2 and 3.\n  - L is not excluded and hasn\'t been tested yet.\n  - If correct, it solves the puzzle. If incorrect, it provides critical information to distinguish between ""POLLY"" and ""POPPY"" (e.g., if L is absent, ""POPPY"" becomes the likely candidate).\n- Given the fixed positions (P, O, Y) and exclusions, ""POLLY"" maximizes the chance of solving or making progress with minimal guesses.\n\nThus, the next guess is **POLLY**.\n\n<guess>polly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: spout -> FEEDBACK: S(x) P(-) O(-) U(x) T(x)\nGuess 3: podgy -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) D(x) G(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 4: polly -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) L(x) L(x) Y(✓)\n'}]","<think>
We have the feedback from the fourth guess: ""polly"" resulted in:
  P(✓) - correct and in the right position (index 0)
  O(✓) - correct and in the right position (index 1)
  L(x) - not in the word (for the first L at index 2)
  L(x) - not in the word (for the second L at index 3)
  Y(✓) - correct and in the right position (index 4)

So, the L's are not in the word. Therefore, we can exclude L.

Now, the secret word pattern is: P O _ _ Y

We know:
- The secret word has P at index 0, O at index 1, and Y at index 4.
- The letters at index 2 and 3 are unknown, but they are not L (and not any of the previously excluded letters).

Previously excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G, and now L.

Available letters: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Note: P, O, Y are in the word but already placed, so for the missing positions, we need two new distinct letters? Or possibly duplicates? But we have no evidence of duplicates yet.)

From the feedback, we know that the secret word does not contain L, so the two middle positions must be filled with two letters from the available set.

We also know from guess 2 that O is not at index 2 (which we already used) and P is not at index 1 (but we have P at index 0, so that's fine).

Now, the word must be a valid English word of the form ""PO??Y"".

Given the exclusions, what words are possible?

Let's list possible words:

- ""POPPY"": P-O-P-P-Y. This has P at index 2 and index 3. But we have excluded? We haven't excluded P, but we already have P at index 0. If the word has P at index 2 and 3, that would be duplicate P. But we don't have any feedback that rules out duplicate letters.

In fact, in guess 3, we had P at index 0 correct, and we didn't test other positions for P. In guess 2, we had P at index 1 marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent with P being at index 0 or index 2 or 3. But we now know P is at index 0, so the P in guess 2 (at index 1) was not correct, but there might be another P? However, in ""POPPY"", there are three P's.

But in the feedback for ""polly"", we had L absent, so if the word is ""POPPY"", then at index 2 and 3 we have P, not L, so the L's being absent is consistent.

Similarly, in ""podgy"", we had D and G absent, which is also consistent.

So ""POPPY"" is a candidate.

Are there other candidates?

- ""POMMY"": P-O-M-M-Y. M is available. ""Pommy"" is a word (slang for British person). But we have duplicate M? And we haven't excluded M.

- ""POBBY"": not a word.

- ""POZZY"": not common, but ""pozzy"" is a slang word for a position or place. It has Z, which is less common.

- ""POKEY"": but E is excluded.

- ""POWDY"": not a word.

- ""POOFY"": but we have O at index1, and if we put O at index2, that would be invalid because from guess2, O cannot be at index2. ""POOFY"" has O at index1 and index2? P-O-O-F-Y -> index2 is O, which is invalid because of guess2 feedback.

Similarly, any word with O at index2 is invalid.

- ""POOPY"": same issue, O at index2.

- ""POOHY"": O at index2? P-O-O-H-Y -> index2 is O, invalid.

- ""JOWLY"": no P at start.

- ""PUDGY"": U and D excluded.

- ""PIGMY"": no O? We have O at index1.

""PIGMY"" is P-I-G-M-Y, no O.

- ""PITHY"": I, T, H, Y -> T excluded.

- ""PINNY"": N excluded.

- ""PIPPY"": P-I-P-P-Y -> no O at index1.

We need O at index1.

So the only common words I can think of are ""POPPY"" and ""POMMY"".

""POMMY"" has M at index2 and index3.

In ""POMMY"", the letters are P, O, M, M, Y.

We haven't tested M yet.

Similarly, ""POPPY"" has P at index2 and index3.

Now, in the feedback from ""polly"", we have L absent, which is consistent with both.

But we need to choose one.

We can guess ""POPPY"" to test.

If we guess ""POPPY"", and the word is ""POPPY"", we win.

If the word is ""POMMY"", then when we guess ""POPPY"", we would get:
- P at index0: correct
- O at index1: correct
- P at index2: but if the word has M at index2, then P is not there, and since the word ""POMMY"" has only one P (at index0), then P at index2 and index3 would be absent. So we get P(✓) O(✓) P(x) P(x) Y(✓)

Similarly, if we guess ""POMMY"" and the word is ""POPPY"", we get P(✓) O(✓) M(x) M(x) Y(✓)

So we can distinguish.

But we are at guess 5, so we have two guesses left. We can guess one of them.

Since ""POPPY"" is a very common word, I'll go with that.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What about ""POWMY""? Not a word.

""POMBE"": E excluded.

""POMBO"": not a word.

""POMEY"": not a word.

""POMLY"": not a word.

""PONGO"": no Y.

""PONGY"": G excluded? P-O-N-G-Y, N and G excluded.

""PONZY"": not a word.

""POOVY"": O at index2? invalid.

""POPSY"": P-O-P-S-Y -> but S is excluded.

""POPPY"" is valid.

""POMMY"" is valid but less common.

Another one: ""POXED"": E excluded.

""POZZY"": P-O-Z-Z-Y. ""Pozzy"" is a word (military slang for jam or a position). Z is available.

So ""POZZY"" is a candidate: P-O-Z-Z-Y.

Similarly, ""POZZY"" has Z at index2 and index3.

We haven't tested Z.

But ""POZZY"" is obscure.

Similarly, ""JAZZY"" no P.

So the main candidates are ""POPPY"", ""POMMY"", and maybe ""POZZY"".

But ""POPPY"" is the most common.

Given that in guess2, we had P marked as present but wrong position. If the word is ""POPPY"", then there is a P at index0 (which we now know) and also at index2 and/or index3. So when we put P at index1 in guess2, it was wrong position, which is consistent because the P is at index0,2,3 but not at index1.

Similarly, for O, it was at index1 in the secret word, and we put it at index2 in guess2, so it was wrong position, which is consistent.

In ""POMMY"", there is only one P at index0, so when we put P at index1 in guess2, it was wrong position (since P is at index0), which is also consistent.

But we have no way to distinguish without guessing.

Since we are at guess 5, I'll guess ""POPPY"".

If it's not, then we can guess ""POMMY"" next.

But let's see the feedback from guess4: we guessed ""polly"" and got L absent. So if the word is ""POPPY"", then the middle letters are P and P, not L. Similarly for ""POMMY"", M and M.

So I think ""POPPY"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I'll go with ""POPPY"".Based on the feedback:

- The secret word has the fixed pattern **P O _ _ Y**.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G, L.
- Available letters for positions 2 and 3: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- From Guess 2, O cannot be at position 3 (index 2) — already accounted for by the fixed O at index 1.
- Common words fitting the pattern and constraints include ""POPPY"" (P-O-P-P-Y) and ""POMMY"" (P-O-M-M-Y). ""POPPY"" is more common and uses P (which is already confirmed but may appear again) for the middle positions.

### Reasoning:
- ""POLLY"" was tested and ruled out (L is absent), leaving ""POPPY"" as a top candidate.
- Guessing ""POPPY"" directly can solve the puzzle if correct. If incorrect, it will confirm whether P appears again and guide the final guess (e.g., ""POMMY"" or ""POZZY"").
- With only 2 unknown positions and limited options, ""POPPY"" is the most efficient guess.

<guess>poppy</guess>
</think>
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. Exclude these letters.
   - **Guess 2 (""spout"")**: 
     - S and U are absent → Exclude S and U.
     - P and O are present but in the wrong positions → P and O are in the word, but not at index 1 (P) or index 2 (O).
     - T is absent → Exclude T.
   - **Guess 3 (""podgy"")**:
     - P is correct at index 0 → Secret word has P at position 1.
     - O is correct at index 1 → Secret word has O at position 2.
     - D and G are absent → Exclude D and G.
     - Y is correct at index 4 → Secret word has Y at position 5.
   - **Guess 4 (""polly"")**:
     - P is correct at index 0 (already known).
     - O is correct at index 1 (already known).
     - Both L's (at index 2 and 3) are absent → Exclude L.
     - Y is correct at index 4 (already known).

2. **Current Knowledge**:
   - **Secret word pattern**: `P O _ _ Y` (positions: 1=P, 2=O, 5=Y).
   - **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G, L (11 letters).
   - **Available letters for positions 3 and 4 (index 2 and 3)**: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
     - Note: P is already confirmed at position 1 but could repeat. O and Y are fixed and unlikely to repeat (no evidence yet).
   - **Constraints from Guess 2**: 
     - O cannot be at position 3 (index 2) → Already satisfied since O is fixed at position 2.
     - P cannot be at position 2 (index 1) → Already satisfied since P is fixed at position 1.

3. **Possible Words**:
   - The secret word must fit `PO??Y` and use only available letters.
   - Top candidates:
     - **""POPPY""**: Fits `P O P P Y`. Uses P (which may repeat) for positions 3 and 4. Common word.
     - **""POMMY""**: Fits `P O M M Y`. Uses M (untested) for positions 3 and 4. Less common but valid (slang for a British person).
     - **""POZZY""**: Fits `P O Z Z Y`. Uses Z (rare) for positions 3 and 4. Valid but obscure (military slang).
   - Other options like ""POBBY"" or ""POFFY"" are invalid words. ""POKEY"" has E (excluded), and ""POLLY"" was already tested.

4. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - Prioritize **""POPPY""** because:
     - It is the most common word matching the pattern.
     - It tests for duplicate P, which is plausible (no feedback rules out repeats).
     - If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback on P in positions 3/4 will confirm if P repeats or if another letter (e.g., M or Z) is needed for the final guess.

5. **Final Decision**:
   - Guess **""POPPY""** to resolve the unknown positions efficiently.

<guess>poppy</guess>",poppy,"We have the feedback from the fourth guess: ""polly"" resulted in:
  P(✓) - correct and in the right position (index 0)
  O(✓) - correct and in the right position (index 1)
  L(x) - not in the word (for the first L at index 2)
  L(x) - not in the word (for the second L at index 3)
  Y(✓) - correct and in the right position (index 4)

So, the L's are not in the word. Therefore, we can exclude L.

Now, the secret word pattern is: P O _ _ Y

We know:
- The secret word has P at index 0, O at index 1, and Y at index 4.
- The letters at index 2 and 3 are unknown, but they are not L (and not any of the previously excluded letters).

Previously excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G, and now L.

Available letters: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z. (Note: P, O, Y are in the word but already placed, so for the missing positions, we need two new distinct letters? Or possibly duplicates? But we have no evidence of duplicates yet.)

From the feedback, we know that the secret word does not contain L, so the two middle positions must be filled with two letters from the available set.

We also know from guess 2 that O is not at index 2 (which we already used) and P is not at index 1 (but we have P at index 0, so that's fine).

Now, the word must be a valid English word of the form ""PO??Y"".

Given the exclusions, what words are possible?

Let's list possible words:

- ""POPPY"": P-O-P-P-Y. This has P at index 2 and index 3. But we have excluded? We haven't excluded P, but we already have P at index 0. If the word has P at index 2 and 3, that would be duplicate P. But we don't have any feedback that rules out duplicate letters.

In fact, in guess 3, we had P at index 0 correct, and we didn't test other positions for P. In guess 2, we had P at index 1 marked as present but wrong position, which is consistent with P being at index 0 or index 2 or 3. But we now know P is at index 0, so the P in guess 2 (at index 1) was not correct, but there might be another P? However, in ""POPPY"", there are three P's.

But in the feedback for ""polly"", we had L absent, so if the word is ""POPPY"", then at index 2 and 3 we have P, not L, so the L's being absent is consistent.

Similarly, in ""podgy"", we had D and G absent, which is also consistent.

So ""POPPY"" is a candidate.

Are there other candidates?

- ""POMMY"": P-O-M-M-Y. M is available. ""Pommy"" is a word (slang for British person). But we have duplicate M? And we haven't excluded M.

- ""POBBY"": not a word.

- ""POZZY"": not common, but ""pozzy"" is a slang word for a position or place. It has Z, which is less common.

- ""POKEY"": but E is excluded.

- ""POWDY"": not a word.

- ""POOFY"": but we have O at index1, and if we put O at index2, that would be invalid because from guess2, O cannot be at index2. ""POOFY"" has O at index1 and index2? P-O-O-F-Y -> index2 is O, which is invalid because of guess2 feedback.

Similarly, any word with O at index2 is invalid.

- ""POOPY"": same issue, O at index2.

- ""POOHY"": O at index2? P-O-O-H-Y -> index2 is O, invalid.

- ""JOWLY"": no P at start.

- ""PUDGY"": U and D excluded.

- ""PIGMY"": no O? We have O at index1.

""PIGMY"" is P-I-G-M-Y, no O.

- ""PITHY"": I, T, H, Y -> T excluded.

- ""PINNY"": N excluded.

- ""PIPPY"": P-I-P-P-Y -> no O at index1.

We need O at index1.

So the only common words I can think of are ""POPPY"" and ""POMMY"".

""POMMY"" has M at index2 and index3.

In ""POMMY"", the letters are P, O, M, M, Y.

We haven't tested M yet.

Similarly, ""POPPY"" has P at index2 and index3.

Now, in the feedback from ""polly"", we have L absent, which is consistent with both.

But we need to choose one.

We can guess ""POPPY"" to test.

If we guess ""POPPY"", and the word is ""POPPY"", we win.

If the word is ""POMMY"", then when we guess ""POPPY"", we would get:
- P at index0: correct
- O at index1: correct
- P at index2: but if the word has M at index2, then P is not there, and since the word ""POMMY"" has only one P (at index0), then P at index2 and index3 would be absent. So we get P(✓) O(✓) P(x) P(x) Y(✓)

Similarly, if we guess ""POMMY"" and the word is ""POPPY"", we get P(✓) O(✓) M(x) M(x) Y(✓)

So we can distinguish.

But we are at guess 5, so we have two guesses left. We can guess one of them.

Since ""POPPY"" is a very common word, I'll go with that.

But let's see if there are other possibilities.

What about ""POWMY""? Not a word.

""POMBE"": E excluded.

""POMBO"": not a word.

""POMEY"": not a word.

""POMLY"": not a word.

""PONGO"": no Y.

""PONGY"": G excluded? P-O-N-G-Y, N and G excluded.

""PONZY"": not a word.

""POOVY"": O at index2? invalid.

""POPSY"": P-O-P-S-Y -> but S is excluded.

""POPPY"" is valid.

""POMMY"" is valid but less common.

Another one: ""POXED"": E excluded.

""POZZY"": P-O-Z-Z-Y. ""Pozzy"" is a word (military slang for jam or a position). Z is available.

So ""POZZY"" is a candidate: P-O-Z-Z-Y.

Similarly, ""POZZY"" has Z at index2 and index3.

We haven't tested Z.

But ""POZZY"" is obscure.

Similarly, ""JAZZY"" no P.

So the main candidates are ""POPPY"", ""POMMY"", and maybe ""POZZY"".

But ""POPPY"" is the most common.

Given that in guess2, we had P marked as present but wrong position. If the word is ""POPPY"", then there is a P at index0 (which we now know) and also at index2 and/or index3. So when we put P at index1 in guess2, it was wrong position, which is consistent because the P is at index0,2,3 but not at index1.

Similarly, for O, it was at index1 in the secret word, and we put it at index2 in guess2, so it was wrong position, which is consistent.

In ""POMMY"", there is only one P at index0, so when we put P at index1 in guess2, it was wrong position (since P is at index0), which is also consistent.

But we have no way to distinguish without guessing.

Since we are at guess 5, I'll guess ""POPPY"".

If it's not, then we can guess ""POMMY"" next.

But let's see the feedback from guess4: we guessed ""polly"" and got L absent. So if the word is ""POPPY"", then the middle letters are P and P, not L. Similarly for ""POMMY"", M and M.

So I think ""POPPY"" is a good guess.

Therefore, I'll go with ""POPPY"".Based on the feedback:

- The secret word has the fixed pattern **P O _ _ Y**.
- Excluded letters: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G, L.
- Available letters for positions 2 and 3: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.
- From Guess 2, O cannot be at position 3 (index 2) — already accounted for by the fixed O at index 1.
- Common words fitting the pattern and constraints include ""POPPY"" (P-O-P-P-Y) and ""POMMY"" (P-O-M-M-Y). ""POPPY"" is more common and uses P (which is already confirmed but may appear again) for the middle positions.

### Reasoning:
- ""POLLY"" was tested and ruled out (L is absent), leaving ""POPPY"" as a top candidate.
- Guessing ""POPPY"" directly can solve the puzzle if correct. If incorrect, it will confirm whether P appears again and guide the final guess (e.g., ""POMMY"" or ""POZZY"").
- With only 2 unknown positions and limited options, ""POPPY"" is the most efficient guess.

<guess>poppy</guess>### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Analyze Previous Feedback**:
   - **Guess 1 (""crane"")**: All letters (C, R, A, N, E) are absent. Exclude these letters.
   - **Guess 2 (""spout"")**: 
     - S and U are absent → Exclude S and U.
     - P and O are present but in the wrong positions → P and O are in the word, but not at index 1 (P) or index 2 (O).
     - T is absent → Exclude T.
   - **Guess 3 (""podgy"")**:
     - P is correct at index 0 → Secret word has P at position 1.
     - O is correct at index 1 → Secret word has O at position 2.
     - D and G are absent → Exclude D and G.
     - Y is correct at index 4 → Secret word has Y at position 5.
   - **Guess 4 (""polly"")**:
     - P is correct at index 0 (already known).
     - O is correct at index 1 (already known).
     - Both L's (at index 2 and 3) are absent → Exclude L.
     - Y is correct at index 4 (already known).

2. **Current Knowledge**:
   - **Secret word pattern**: `P O _ _ Y` (positions: 1=P, 2=O, 5=Y).
   - **Excluded letters**: C, R, A, N, E, S, U, T, D, G, L (11 letters).
   - **Available letters for positions 3 and 4 (index 2 and 3)**: B, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.
     - Note: P is already confirmed at position 1 but could repeat. O and Y are fixed and unlikely to repeat (no evidence yet).
   - **Constraints from Guess 2**: 
     - O cannot be at position 3 (index 2) → Already satisfied since O is fixed at position 2.
     - P cannot be at position 2 (index 1) → Already satisfied since P is fixed at position 1.

3. **Possible Words**:
   - The secret word must fit `PO??Y` and use only available letters.
   - Top candidates:
     - **""POPPY""**: Fits `P O P P Y`. Uses P (which may repeat) for positions 3 and 4. Common word.
     - **""POMMY""**: Fits `P O M M Y`. Uses M (untested) for positions 3 and 4. Less common but valid (slang for a British person).
     - **""POZZY""**: Fits `P O Z Z Y`. Uses Z (rare) for positions 3 and 4. Valid but obscure (military slang).
   - Other options like ""POBBY"" or ""POFFY"" are invalid words. ""POKEY"" has E (excluded), and ""POLLY"" was already tested.

4. **Strategy for Guess 5**:
   - Prioritize **""POPPY""** because:
     - It is the most common word matching the pattern.
     - It tests for duplicate P, which is plausible (no feedback rules out repeats).
     - If correct, the game ends. If incorrect, feedback on P in positions 3/4 will confirm if P repeats or if another letter (e.g., M or Z) is needed for the final guess.

5. **Final Decision**:
   - Guess **""POPPY""** to resolve the unknown positions efficiently.",Guess 5: poppy -> FEEDBACK: P(✓) O(✓) P(✓) P(✓) Y(✓),SUCCESS
