We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
2. The letter R is not in the word at all.
3. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it there and it was marked as wrong position).
4. The letter N is not in the word.
5. The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Also, note that the secret word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

We can now think about the constraints for the next guess:
- The word must start with C.
- The word must contain A and E, but not in the positions we tried (so A cannot be at position 2, and E cannot be at position 5).
- The word must not contain R or N.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we have:
Position 1: C (fixed)
Position 2: ? (cannot be A, and cannot be R or N; also, since A is in the word but not here, we must place A elsewhere)
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: ? (cannot be E)

We need to form a word that starts with C, has A and E (but not at position 2 and 5 respectively), and without R and N.

Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with C.

We know A must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5? But wait, position 5 cannot be E? Actually, position 5 cannot be E because in the first guess we had E at position 5 and it was marked as wrong position. But note: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So E must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4? But wait, we have constraints on position 2: we cannot put A there, but E might be allowed at position 2? However, we also have to consider that the word must have A and E.

But note: we cannot put E at position 5, but we can put it at 2, 3, or 4. However, we must also place A somewhere (positions 3,4,5) but not at 2.

But wait: the feedback for A was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A must be in the word, but not at position 2. Similarly, E must be in the word, but not at position 5.

Now, we also know that the word does not have R or N.

So, let's try to come up with a word that starts with C, and then has A and E in positions 3,4, or 5 (for A) and 2,3,4 (for E) but note that the same position cannot have two letters.

Possible positions for A: 3,4,5 (but if we put A at 5, that's okay because the feedback only said E cannot be at 5, not A).
Similarly, E can be at 2,3,4.

But we must avoid R and N.

Let me list some words:

Common words starting with C: 
- cake, came, cape, care, case, cave, ... but note: we cannot have R (so care is out) and we cannot have N (so cane is out).

But we know from feedback that the word has A and E. So we need a word with A and E.

Let's think of words that start with C, have A and E, and without R and N.

Possible words:
- cease: but that has two E's? Let's check: C E A S E. But we have E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at position 5? So if we use ""cease"", then position 5 is E, which is not allowed. So no.

- crate: but has R and T? We don't know about T, but R is not allowed. So no.

- chafe: C H A F E -> but E is at position 5, which is not allowed. So no.

- cable: C A B L E -> but we have A at position 2, which is not allowed (because in the first guess, A was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning A is in the word but not at position 2). So we cannot put A at position 2. So ""cable"" is invalid because it puts A at position 2.

- camel: C A M E L -> again, A at position 2 is not allowed. Also, we cannot have N? Camel has no N, but it has A at position 2 -> invalid.

- cape: too short.

We need 5 letters.

Let me try: 
- clade: C L A D E -> but E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

- cade: too short.

- cease: already considered.

- chape: not a common word? And E at 5.

We need to avoid E at 5 and A at 2.

So let's try to put A at position 3 or 4, and E at position 2 or 3 or 4 (but not the same as A).

For example:
- ceas? ... but we cannot have E at 5? So how about ""cease"" without the last E? Not 5 letters.

Another idea: place E at position 2? Then we can have a word like ""ce__a"" but then we need to fill the middle and the last letter must not be E.

But we have to have A in the word, so if we put A at position 4 or 5.

Example: 
- ""ceiba"" -> C E I B A. This is a word (a type of tree). 
  - Position 1: C (correct)
  - Position 2: E (we don't know if that's allowed for E? The feedback only said E is in the word but not at position 5, so it can be at 2)
  - Position 5: A (which is allowed because the feedback didn't say anything about A at 5, only that it's not at 2)

But does ""ceiba"" have any forbidden letters? R and N? No. So it's a candidate.

But we also have to consider that the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 2. In ""ceiba"", A is at position 5, which is fine.

Similarly, E is at position 2, which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 5.

But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that E is in the word, but not at position 5. It didn't say anything about position 2. So E can be at 2.

So ""ceiba"" is a valid guess.

But let me check if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""cameo"" -> C A M E O -> but A is at position 2, which is not allowed. So invalid.

""caveo"" -> not a word.

""cable"" -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""cagey"" -> C A G E Y -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""cajeput"" -> too long.

""calesa"" -> too long.

""cameo"" -> invalid.

""capex"" -> C A P E X -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""carex"" -> has R -> invalid.

""carte"" -> has R -> invalid.

""cause"" -> C A U S E -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""cavie"" -> not common, and A at 2 -> invalid.

So words without A at position 2 and without E at position 5, and without R and N, and having both A and E.

Another candidate: ""cadet"" -> C A D E T -> but A is at position 2 -> invalid.

""caked"" -> C A K E D -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""calve"" -> C A L V E -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""camel"" -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""caned"" -> has N -> invalid.

""caped"" -> C A P E D -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""cared"" -> has R -> invalid.

""cased"" -> C A S E D -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""caved"" -> A at 2 -> invalid.

So it's hard to find words without A at position 2.

Perhaps we should try a word that has A at position 3 or 4.

For example, ""cheap"": C H E A P -> 
- Position 1: C (good)
- Position 2: H (unknown)
- Position 3: E (we don't know if E can be at 3? The feedback only said E is not at 5, so 3 is okay)
- Position 4: A (okay, because A is not at 2 and we are putting it at 4)
- Position 5: P (unknown)

But does ""cheap"" have R or N? No. So it's a valid word.

Similarly, ""chela"": C H E L A -> 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: A

This also avoids A at 2 and E at 5.

Another one: ""cleat"" -> C L E A T -> 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: T

But we don't know if T is in the word? But that's okay.

But note: we have to avoid R and N, which we are.

However, we have two candidates: ""ceiba"", ""cheap"", ""chela"", ""cleat"".

But we also have to consider that the word must have the letters A and E, which they all do.

But we don't have any information about other letters. So we can choose any.

But we want to maximize information. We know the first letter is C, and we know A and E are in the word. We don't know the other two letters.

In ""ceiba"", we are testing E at position 2 and A at position 5, and also the letters I and B.

In ""cheap"", we are testing H, E at 3, A at 4, and P.

In ""cleat"", we are testing L, E at 3, A at 4, and T.

We might want to avoid repeating the same positions for A and E? But we don't have much choice.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has new letters to get more information.

But note: we have only used the letters C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid R and N, but we can use other consonants.

Let me think of a word that has A and E in new positions and uses common consonants.

Another candidate: ""chase"" -> but E at 5 -> not allowed.

""chafe"" -> E at 5 -> not allowed.

""cable"" -> A at 2 -> not allowed.

""cadge"" -> C A D G E -> A at 2 -> not allowed.

""cella"" -> C E L L A -> 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: A

This is a word (meaning a cell in a convent). It has A at 5 and E at 2, and two L's. But we don't know if L is in the word? But that's okay.

But it has duplicate L's? That might be okay.

But let's compare: ""ceiba"" and ""cella"" both have E at 2 and A at 5.

But ""ceiba"" has I and B, which are less common? Maybe.

Another word: ""cecal"" -> C E C A L -> but duplicate C? And the first letter is C, so the second C would be a duplicate? But the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

But in our first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was correct, so if the word has another C, then in the first guess we would have seen two C's? But we only had one C and it was at position 1. The feedback for the first guess: we had only one C and it was marked correct. So if the word had two C's, then the other C would have been marked as well? But we didn't have another C in the guess. So we don't know if there is a duplicate C.

But to be safe, we might avoid duplicate letters for now.

So ""cecal"" has two C's -> might be confusing.

Another candidate: ""cesta"" -> C E S T A -> 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: A

This is a word (a basket used in jai alai). It has E at 2 and A at 5, and S and T.

This seems good.

Similarly, ""ceiba"" is also good.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information.

I think ""cesta"" is a bit obscure. ""cheap"" is more common.

But in ""cheap"", we have E at position 3 and A at position 4, which are new positions (we haven't tested E at 3 or A at 4 in the first guess).

In the first guess, we had A at position 2 and E at position 5. Now we are testing A at 4 and E at 3.

This might give us more information about the positions of A and E.

Whereas if we put E at 2 and A at 5 (like in ""ceiba"" or ""cesta""), we are testing new positions too.

But I think ""cheap"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests the middle positions.

Another common word: ""cleat"" as I thought earlier.

But let me see: ""cheap"" vs ""cleat"".

We don't have any information about H, P, L, T, etc.

I think either is fine.

But note: we must avoid R and N, which both do.

I'll go with ""cheap"" because it's a common word.

So my next guess is ""cheap"".

But let me double-check: 
- C at 1: should be correct (but we are guessing, so it will be confirmed by feedback)
- H: new letter
- E: we know E is in the word, but we are putting it at position 3 (which is a new position, so if it's correct we get a check, if not we know it's elsewhere)
- A: at position 4 (new position)
- P: new letter

This should give us good information.

So the guess is ""cheap"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Constraints for the next guess:
- The word must start with C.
- The word must contain A and E, but A cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- The word must not contain R or N.
- A and E must be placed in new positions (positions 3, 4, or 2/3/4 respectively) to test their correct locations.

Considering common 5-letter words that fit these constraints, ""cheap"" is a valid choice:
- Starts with C (position 1).
- Places E in position 3 (a new position to test).
- Places A in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Avoids R and N.
- Uses new letters (H, P) for additional information.

This guess maximizes feedback on the positions of A and E while exploring new consonants.

<guess>cheap</guess>",cheap,"We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
2. The letter R is not in the word at all.
3. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it there and it was marked as wrong position).

Now, we also know that the word does not have R or N.

So, let's try to come up with a word that starts with C, and then has A and E in positions 3,4, or 5 (for A) and 2,3,4 (for E) but note that the same position cannot have two letters.

For example, ""cheap"": C H E A P -> 
- Position 1: C (good)
- Position 2: H (unknown)
- Position 3: E (we don't know if E can be at 3? The feedback only said E is not at 5, so 3 is okay)
- Position 4: A (okay, because A is not at 2 and we are putting it at 4)
- Position 5: P (unknown)

But does ""cheap"" have R or N? No. So it's a valid word.

Similarly, ""chela"": C H E L A -> 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: A

This also avoids A at 2 and E at 5.

Another one: ""cleat"" -> C L E A T -> 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: T

But we don't know if T is in the word? But that's okay.

But note: we have to avoid R and N, which we are.

However, we have two candidates: ""ceiba"", ""cheap"", ""chela"", ""cleat"".

But we also have to consider that the word must have the letters A and E, which they all do.

But we don't have any information about other letters. So we can choose any.

But we want to maximize information. We know the first letter is C, and we know A and E are in the word. We don't know the other two letters.

In ""ceiba"", we are testing E at position 2 and A at position 5, and also the letters I and B.

In ""cheap"", we are testing H, E at 3, A at 4, and P.

In ""cleat"", we are testing L, E at 3, A at 4, and T.

We might want to avoid repeating the same positions for A and E? But we don't have much choice.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has new letters to get more information.

But note: we have only used the letters C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid R and N, but we can use other consonants.

Let me think of a word that has A and E in new positions and uses common consonants.

Another candidate: ""chase"" -> but E at 5 -> not allowed.

""chafe"" -> E at 5 -> not allowed.

""cable"" -> A at 2 -> not allowed.

""cadge"" -> C A D G E -> A at 2 -> not allowed.

""cella"" -> C E L L A -> 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: A

This is a word (meaning a cell in a convent). It has A at 5 and E at 2, and two L's. But we don't know if L is in the word? But that's okay.

But it has duplicate L's? That might be okay.

But let's compare: ""ceiba"" and ""cella"" both have E at 2 and A at 5.

But ""ceiba"" has I and B, which are less common? Maybe.

Another word: ""cecal"" -> C E C A L -> but duplicate C? And the first letter is C, so the second C would be a duplicate? But the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

But in our first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was correct, so if the word has another C, then in the first guess we would have seen two C's? But we only had one C and it was at position 1. The feedback for the first guess: we had only one C and it was marked correct. So if the word had two C's, then the other C would have been marked as well? But we didn't have another C in the guess. So we don't know if there is a duplicate C.

But to be safe, we might avoid duplicate letters for now.

So ""cecal"" has two C's -> might be confusing.

Another candidate: ""cesta"" -> C E S T A -> 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: A

This is a word (a basket used in jai alai). It has E at 2 and A at 5, and S and T.

This seems good.

Similarly, ""ceiba"" is also good.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information.

I think ""cesta"" is a bit obscure. ""cheap"" is more common.

But in ""cheap"", we have E at position 3 and A at position 4, which are new positions (we haven't tested E at 3 or A at 4 in the first guess).

In the first guess, we had A at position 2 and E at position 5. Now we are testing A at 4 and E at 3.

This might give us more information about the positions of A and E.

Whereas if we put E at 2 and A at 5 (like in ""ceiba"" or ""cesta""), we are testing new positions too.

But I think ""cheap"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests the middle positions.

Another common word: ""cleat"" as I thought earlier.

But let me see: ""cheap"" vs ""cleat"".

We don't have any information about H, P, L, T, etc.

I think either is fine.

But note: we must avoid R and N, which both do.

I'll go with ""cheap"" because it's a common word.

So my next guess is ""cheap"".

But let me double-check: 
- C at 1: should be correct (but we are guessing, so it will be confirmed by feedback)
- H: new letter
- E: we know E is in the word, but we are putting it at position 3 (which is a new position, so if it's correct we get a check, if not we know it's elsewhere)
- A: at position 4 (new position)
- P: new letter

This should give us good information.

So the guess is ""cheap"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Constraints for the next guess:
- The word must start with C.
- The word must contain A and E, but A cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- The word must not contain R or N.
- A and E must be placed in new positions (positions 3, 4, or 2/3/4 respectively) to test their correct locations.

Considering common 5-letter words that fit these constraints, ""cheap"" is a valid choice:
- Starts with C (position 1).
- Places E in position 3 (a new position to test).
- Places A in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Avoids R and N.
- Uses new letters (H, P) for additional information.

This guess maximizes feedback on the positions of A and E while exploring new consonants.",Guess 2: cheap -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) E(✓) A(✓) P(x),FAIL
deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-0528,3,CHEAT,"<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.
<｜User｜>Make your first 5-letter word guess.<｜Assistant｜>We are starting the game. We have no prior feedback, so we need to choose a good starting word.
 A good starting word should have a mix of common vowels and consonants to maximize information.
 Common starting words in Wordle include words like ""CRANE"", ""SLATE"", ""TRACE"", ""ROAST"", etc.

 Let's choose a word that has 5 distinct letters and includes common letters.
 I'll go with ""CRANE"" because it has C, R, A, N, E which are fairly common.

 So, my first guess is: CRANE

<guess>crane</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)
<｜Assistant｜>We are given feedback for the first guess ""crane"":
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in the word but wrong position)
- N: x (not in the word)
- E: - (in the word but wrong position)

So, from this feedback, we know:
1. The first letter is C. So the secret word starts with C.
2. The letter R is not in the word at all.
3. The letter A is in the word, but not in the second position (since we guessed it there and it was marked as wrong position).
4. The letter N is not in the word.
5. The letter E is in the word, but not in the fifth position.

Also, note that the secret word is 5 letters and must be a valid English word.

We can now think about the constraints for the next guess:
- The word must start with C.
- The word must contain A and E, but not in the positions we tried (so A cannot be at position 2, and E cannot be at position 5).
- The word must not contain R or N.

We also know that the word has exactly 5 letters, so we have:
Position 1: C (fixed)
Position 2: ? (cannot be A, and cannot be R or N; also, since A is in the word but not here, we must place A elsewhere)
Position 3: ?
Position 4: ?
Position 5: ? (cannot be E)

We need to form a word that starts with C, has A and E (but not at position 2 and 5 respectively), and without R and N.

Let's think of common 5-letter words starting with C.

We know A must be in one of positions 3, 4, or 5? But wait, position 5 cannot be E? Actually, position 5 cannot be E because in the first guess we had E at position 5 and it was marked as wrong position. But note: the feedback for E was ""-"", meaning E is in the word but not at position 5. So E must be in one of positions 2, 3, or 4? But wait, we have constraints on position 2: we cannot put A there, but E might be allowed at position 2? However, we also have to consider that the word must have A and E.

But note: we cannot put E at position 5, but we can put it at 2, 3, or 4. However, we must also place A somewhere (positions 3,4,5) but not at 2.

But wait: the feedback for A was at position 2 and it was marked as present but wrong position. So A must be in the word, but not at position 2. Similarly, E must be in the word, but not at position 5.

Now, we also know that the word does not have R or N.

So, let's try to come up with a word that starts with C, and then has A and E in positions 3,4, or 5 (for A) and 2,3,4 (for E) but note that the same position cannot have two letters.

Possible positions for A: 3,4,5 (but if we put A at 5, that's okay because the feedback only said E cannot be at 5, not A).
Similarly, E can be at 2,3,4.

But we must avoid R and N.

Let me list some words:

Common words starting with C: 
- cake, came, cape, care, case, cave, ... but note: we cannot have R (so care is out) and we cannot have N (so cane is out).

But we know from feedback that the word has A and E. So we need a word with A and E.

Let's think of words that start with C, have A and E, and without R and N.

Possible words:
- cease: but that has two E's? Let's check: C E A S E. But we have E at position 2 and 5? But we cannot have E at position 5? So if we use ""cease"", then position 5 is E, which is not allowed. So no.

- crate: but has R and T? We don't know about T, but R is not allowed. So no.

- chafe: C H A F E -> but E is at position 5, which is not allowed. So no.

- cable: C A B L E -> but we have A at position 2, which is not allowed (because in the first guess, A was at position 2 and it was marked as wrong position, meaning A is in the word but not at position 2). So we cannot put A at position 2. So ""cable"" is invalid because it puts A at position 2.

- camel: C A M E L -> again, A at position 2 is not allowed. Also, we cannot have N? Camel has no N, but it has A at position 2 -> invalid.

- cape: too short.

We need 5 letters.

Let me try: 
- clade: C L A D E -> but E is at position 5 -> not allowed.

- cade: too short.

- cease: already considered.

- chape: not a common word? And E at 5.

We need to avoid E at 5 and A at 2.

So let's try to put A at position 3 or 4, and E at position 2 or 3 or 4 (but not the same as A).

For example:
- ceas? ... but we cannot have E at 5? So how about ""cease"" without the last E? Not 5 letters.

Another idea: place E at position 2? Then we can have a word like ""ce__a"" but then we need to fill the middle and the last letter must not be E.

But we have to have A in the word, so if we put A at position 4 or 5.

Example: 
- ""ceiba"" -> C E I B A. This is a word (a type of tree). 
  - Position 1: C (correct)
  - Position 2: E (we don't know if that's allowed for E? The feedback only said E is in the word but not at position 5, so it can be at 2)
  - Position 5: A (which is allowed because the feedback didn't say anything about A at 5, only that it's not at 2)

But does ""ceiba"" have any forbidden letters? R and N? No. So it's a candidate.

But we also have to consider that the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 2. In ""ceiba"", A is at position 5, which is fine.

Similarly, E is at position 2, which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 5.

But wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that E is in the word, but not at position 5. It didn't say anything about position 2. So E can be at 2.

So ""ceiba"" is a valid guess.

But let me check if there are other possibilities.

Another word: ""cameo"" -> C A M E O -> but A is at position 2, which is not allowed. So invalid.

""caveo"" -> not a word.

""cable"" -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""cagey"" -> C A G E Y -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""cajeput"" -> too long.

""calesa"" -> too long.

""cameo"" -> invalid.

""capex"" -> C A P E X -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""carex"" -> has R -> invalid.

""carte"" -> has R -> invalid.

""cause"" -> C A U S E -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""cavie"" -> not common, and A at 2 -> invalid.

So words without A at position 2 and without E at position 5, and without R and N, and having both A and E.

Another candidate: ""cadet"" -> C A D E T -> but A is at position 2 -> invalid.

""caked"" -> C A K E D -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""calve"" -> C A L V E -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""camel"" -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""caned"" -> has N -> invalid.

""caped"" -> C A P E D -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""cared"" -> has R -> invalid.

""cased"" -> C A S E D -> A at 2 -> invalid.

""caved"" -> A at 2 -> invalid.

So it's hard to find words without A at position 2.

Perhaps we should try a word that has A at position 3 or 4.

For example, ""cheap"": C H E A P -> 
- Position 1: C (good)
- Position 2: H (unknown)
- Position 3: E (we don't know if E can be at 3? The feedback only said E is not at 5, so 3 is okay)
- Position 4: A (okay, because A is not at 2 and we are putting it at 4)
- Position 5: P (unknown)

But does ""cheap"" have R or N? No. So it's a valid word.

Similarly, ""chela"": C H E L A -> 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: A

This also avoids A at 2 and E at 5.

Another one: ""cleat"" -> C L E A T -> 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: L
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: T

But we don't know if T is in the word? But that's okay.

But note: we have to avoid R and N, which we are.

However, we have two candidates: ""ceiba"", ""cheap"", ""chela"", ""cleat"".

But we also have to consider that the word must have the letters A and E, which they all do.

But we don't have any information about other letters. So we can choose any.

But we want to maximize information. We know the first letter is C, and we know A and E are in the word. We don't know the other two letters.

In ""ceiba"", we are testing E at position 2 and A at position 5, and also the letters I and B.

In ""cheap"", we are testing H, E at 3, A at 4, and P.

In ""cleat"", we are testing L, E at 3, A at 4, and T.

We might want to avoid repeating the same positions for A and E? But we don't have much choice.

Alternatively, we can try to use a word that has new letters to get more information.

But note: we have only used the letters C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid R and N, but we can use other consonants.

Let me think of a word that has A and E in new positions and uses common consonants.

Another candidate: ""chase"" -> but E at 5 -> not allowed.

""chafe"" -> E at 5 -> not allowed.

""cable"" -> A at 2 -> not allowed.

""cadge"" -> C A D G E -> A at 2 -> not allowed.

""cella"" -> C E L L A -> 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: L
- Position 4: L
- Position 5: A

This is a word (meaning a cell in a convent). It has A at 5 and E at 2, and two L's. But we don't know if L is in the word? But that's okay.

But it has duplicate L's? That might be okay.

But let's compare: ""ceiba"" and ""cella"" both have E at 2 and A at 5.

But ""ceiba"" has I and B, which are less common? Maybe.

Another word: ""cecal"" -> C E C A L -> but duplicate C? And the first letter is C, so the second C would be a duplicate? But the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don't know.

But in our first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was correct, so if the word has another C, then in the first guess we would have seen two C's? But we only had one C and it was at position 1. The feedback for the first guess: we had only one C and it was marked correct. So if the word had two C's, then the other C would have been marked as well? But we didn't have another C in the guess. So we don't know if there is a duplicate C.

But to be safe, we might avoid duplicate letters for now.

So ""cecal"" has two C's -> might be confusing.

Another candidate: ""cesta"" -> C E S T A -> 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: E
- Position 3: S
- Position 4: T
- Position 5: A

This is a word (a basket used in jai alai). It has E at 2 and A at 5, and S and T.

This seems good.

Similarly, ""ceiba"" is also good.

But let's choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information.

I think ""cesta"" is a bit obscure. ""cheap"" is more common.

But in ""cheap"", we have E at position 3 and A at position 4, which are new positions (we haven't tested E at 3 or A at 4 in the first guess).

In the first guess, we had A at position 2 and E at position 5. Now we are testing A at 4 and E at 3.

This might give us more information about the positions of A and E.

Whereas if we put E at 2 and A at 5 (like in ""ceiba"" or ""cesta""), we are testing new positions too.

But I think ""cheap"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests the middle positions.

Another common word: ""cleat"" as I thought earlier.

But let me see: ""cheap"" vs ""cleat"".

We don't have any information about H, P, L, T, etc.

I think either is fine.

But note: we must avoid R and N, which both do.

I'll go with ""cheap"" because it's a common word.

So my next guess is ""cheap"".

But let me double-check: 
- C at 1: should be correct (but we are guessing, so it will be confirmed by feedback)
- H: new letter
- E: we know E is in the word, but we are putting it at position 3 (which is a new position, so if it's correct we get a check, if not we know it's elsewhere)
- A: at position 4 (new position)
- P: new letter

This should give us good information.

So the guess is ""cheap"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).
- R is not in the word (x).
- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-).
- N is not in the word (x).
- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).

Constraints for the next guess:
- The word must start with C.
- The word must contain A and E, but A cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.
- The word must not contain R or N.
- A and E must be placed in new positions (positions 3, 4, or 2/3/4 respectively) to test their correct locations.

Considering common 5-letter words that fit these constraints, ""cheap"" is a valid choice:
- Starts with C (position 1).
- Places E in position 3 (a new position to test).
- Places A in position 4 (a new position to test).
- Avoids R and N.
- Uses new letters (H, P) for additional information.

This guess maximizes feedback on the positions of A and E while exploring new consonants.

So we cannot put A at position 2. So ""cable"" is invalid because it puts A at position 2.\n\n- camel: C A M E L -> again, A at position 2 is not allowed. Also, we cannot have N? Camel has no N, but it has A at position 2 -> invalid.\n\n- cape: too short.\n\nWe need 5 letters.\n\nLet me try: \n- clade: C L A D E -> but E is at position 5 -> not allowed.\n\n- cade: too short.\n\n- cease: already considered.\n\n- chape: not a common word? And E at 5.\n\nWe need to avoid E at 5 and A at 2.\n\nSo let\'s try to put A at position 3 or 4, and E at position 2 or 3 or 4 (but not the same as A).\n\nFor example:\n- ceas? ... but we cannot have E at 5? So how about ""cease"" without the last E? Not 5 letters.\n\nAnother idea: place E at position 2? Then we can have a word like ""ce__a"" but then we need to fill the middle and the last letter must not be E.\n\nBut we have to have A in the word, so if we put A at position 4 or 5.\n\nExample: \n- ""ceiba"" -> C E I B A. This is a word (a type of tree). \n  - Position 1: C (correct)\n  - Position 2: E (we don\'t know if that\'s allowed for E? The feedback only said E is in the word but not at position 5, so it can be at 2)\n  - Position 5: A (which is allowed because the feedback didn\'t say anything about A at 5, only that it\'s not at 2)\n\nBut does ""ceiba"" have any forbidden letters? R and N? No. So it\'s a candidate.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the feedback for A was that it is in the word but not at position 2. In ""ceiba"", A is at position 5, which is fine.\n\nSimilarly, E is at position 2, which is allowed because the feedback only said E is not at 5.\n\nBut wait: the feedback for the first guess told us that E is in the word, but not at position 5. It didn\'t say anything about position 2. So E can be at 2.\n\nSo ""ceiba"" is a valid guess.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possibilities.\n\nAnother word: ""cameo"" -> C A M E O -> but A is at position 2, which is not allowed. So invalid.\n\n""caveo"" -> not a word.\n\n""cable"" -> A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n""cagey"" -> C A G E Y -> A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n""cajeput"" -> too long.\n\n""calesa"" -> too long.\n\n""cameo"" -> invalid.\n\n""capex"" -> C A P E X -> A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n""carex"" -> has R -> invalid.\n\n""carte"" -> has R -> invalid.\n\n""cause"" -> C A U S E -> A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n""cavie"" -> not common, and A at 2 -> invalid.\n\nSo words without A at position 2 and without E at position 5, and without R and N, and having both A and E.\n\nAnother candidate: ""cadet"" -> C A D E T -> but A is at position 2 -> invalid.\n\n""caked"" -> C A K E D -> A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n""calve"" -> C A L V E -> A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n""camel"" -> A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n""caned"" -> has N -> invalid.\n\n""caped"" -> C A P E D -> A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n""cared"" -> has R -> invalid.\n\n""cased"" -> C A S E D -> A at 2 -> invalid.\n\n""caved"" -> A at 2 -> invalid.\n\nSo it\'s hard to find words without A at position 2.\n\nPerhaps we should try a word that has A at position 3 or 4.\n\nFor example, ""cheap"": C H E A P -> \n- Position 1: C (good)\n- Position 2: H (unknown)\n- Position 3: E (we don\'t know if E can be at 3? The feedback only said E is not at 5, so 3 is okay)\n- Position 4: A (okay, because A is not at 2 and we are putting it at 4)\n- Position 5: P (unknown)\n\nBut does ""cheap"" have R or N? No. So it\'s a valid word.\n\nSimilarly, ""chela"": C H E L A -> \n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: H\n- Position 3: E\n- Position 4: L\n- Position 5: A\n\nThis also avoids A at 2 and E at 5.\n\nAnother one: ""cleat"" -> C L E A T -> \n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: L\n- Position 3: E\n- Position 4: A\n- Position 5: T\n\nBut we don\'t know if T is in the word? But that\'s okay.\n\nBut note: we have to avoid R and N, which we are.\n\nHowever, we have two candidates: ""ceiba"", ""cheap"", ""chela"", ""cleat"".\n\nBut we also have to consider that the word must have the letters A and E, which they all do.\n\nBut we don\'t have any information about other letters. So we can choose any.\n\nBut we want to maximize information. We know the first letter is C, and we know A and E are in the word. We don\'t know the other two letters.\n\nIn ""ceiba"", we are testing E at position 2 and A at position 5, and also the letters I and B.\n\nIn ""cheap"", we are testing H, E at 3, A at 4, and P.\n\nIn ""cleat"", we are testing L, E at 3, A at 4, and T.\n\nWe might want to avoid repeating the same positions for A and E? But we don\'t have much choice.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use a word that has new letters to get more information.\n\nBut note: we have only used the letters C, R, A, N, E. So we should avoid R and N, but we can use other consonants.\n\nLet me think of a word that has A and E in new positions and uses common consonants.\n\nAnother candidate: ""chase"" -> but E at 5 -> not allowed.\n\n""chafe"" -> E at 5 -> not allowed.\n\n""cable"" -> A at 2 -> not allowed.\n\n""cadge"" -> C A D G E -> A at 2 -> not allowed.\n\n""cella"" -> C E L L A -> \n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: L\n- Position 4: L\n- Position 5: A\n\nThis is a word (meaning a cell in a convent). It has A at 5 and E at 2, and two L\'s. But we don\'t know if L is in the word? But that\'s okay.\n\nBut it has duplicate L\'s? That might be okay.\n\nBut let\'s compare: ""ceiba"" and ""cella"" both have E at 2 and A at 5.\n\nBut ""ceiba"" has I and B, which are less common? Maybe.\n\nAnother word: ""cecal"" -> C E C A L -> but duplicate C? And the first letter is C, so the second C would be a duplicate? But the secret word might have duplicate letters? We don\'t know.\n\nBut in our first guess, we had C at position 1 and it was correct, so if the word has another C, then in the first guess we would have seen two C\'s? But we only had one C and it was at position 1. The feedback for the first guess: we had only one C and it was marked correct. So if the word had two C\'s, then the other C would have been marked as well? But we didn\'t have another C in the guess. So we don\'t know if there is a duplicate C.\n\nBut to be safe, we might avoid duplicate letters for now.\n\nSo ""cecal"" has two C\'s -> might be confusing.\n\nAnother candidate: ""cesta"" -> C E S T A -> \n- Position 1: C\n- Position 2: E\n- Position 3: S\n- Position 4: T\n- Position 5: A\n\nThis is a word (a basket used in jai alai). It has E at 2 and A at 5, and S and T.\n\nThis seems good.\n\nSimilarly, ""ceiba"" is also good.\n\nBut let\'s choose a word that uses common letters to maximize information.\n\nI think ""cesta"" is a bit obscure. ""cheap"" is more common.\n\nBut in ""cheap"", we have E at position 3 and A at position 4, which are new positions (we haven\'t tested E at 3 or A at 4 in the first guess).\n\nIn the first guess, we had A at position 2 and E at position 5. Now we are testing A at 4 and E at 3.\n\nThis might give us more information about the positions of A and E.\n\nWhereas if we put E at 2 and A at 5 (like in ""ceiba"" or ""cesta""), we are testing new positions too.\n\nBut I think ""cheap"" is a good choice because it uses common letters and tests the middle positions.\n\nAnother common word: ""cleat"" as I thought earlier.\n\nBut let me see: ""cheap"" vs ""cleat"".\n\nWe don\'t have any information about H, P, L, T, etc.\n\nI think either is fine.\n\nBut note: we must avoid R and N, which both do.\n\nI\'ll go with ""cheap"" because it\'s a common word.\n\nSo my next guess is ""cheap"".\n\nBut let me double-check: \n- C at 1: should be correct (but we are guessing, so it will be confirmed by feedback)\n- H: new letter\n- E: we know E is in the word, but we are putting it at position 3 (which is a new position, so if it\'s correct we get a check, if not we know it\'s elsewhere)\n- A: at position 4 (new position)\n- P: new letter\n\nThis should give us good information.\n\nSo the guess is ""cheap"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":\n- C is correct and in position 1 (✓).\n- R is not in the word (x).\n- A is in the word but not in position 2 (-).\n- N is not in the word (x).\n- E is in the word but not in position 5 (-).\n\nConstraints for the next guess:\n- The word must start with C.\n- The word must contain A and E, but A cannot be in position 2, and E cannot be in position 5.\n- The word must not contain R or N.\n- A and E must be placed in new positions (positions 3, 4, or 2/3/4 respectively) to test their correct locations.\n\nConsidering common 5-letter words that fit these constraints, ""cheap"" is a valid choice:\n- Starts with C (position 1).\n- Places E in position 3 (a new position to test).\n- Places A in position 4 (a new position to test).\n- Avoids R and N.\n- Uses new letters (H, P) for additional information.\n\nThis guess maximizes feedback on the positions of A and E while exploring new consonants.\n\n<guess>cheap</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)\nGuess 2: cheap -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) E(✓) A(✓) P(x)\n'}]","<think>
We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: CHEAP
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- H: ✓ (correct position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- P: x (not in word)

From Guess 1, we know:
- The first letter is C.
- A is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- R and N are not in the word.

From Guess 2:
- The first letter is C (confirmed again).
- The second letter is H (correct position).
- The third letter is E (correct position).
- The fourth letter is A (correct position).
- P is not in the word.

So, putting it together:
- The secret word starts with ""C"", has ""H"" in the second position, ""E"" in the third, and ""A"" in the fourth.
- The word must have five letters, so we are missing the fifth letter.
- We know the fifth letter cannot be E (from Guess 1) and cannot be P (from Guess 2). Also, it cannot be R or N (from Guess 1).

Therefore, the word so far is: C H E A ?

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: ""C H E A ?"" and the last letter is not E, P, R, or N.

Additionally, from Guess 1, we know that A is not in position 2 (which is now H) and E is not in position 5 (which we are about to fill). Since we have A in position 4 and E in position 3, that satisfies the conditions from the first guess.

Now, what can the last letter be? It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""CHEA"" at the beginning.

Possible words:
- CHECK: but that would be C H E C K -> but we have two C's? The first C is fixed, and if we put C at the end, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the first guess, we had only one C and it was correct, so if there were another C, it might have been indicated? But we didn't have a second C in the guess. So it's possible. But let's see the feedback: in Guess 2, we have C at position 1 and no other C, so if the word had a C at the end, it wouldn't have been revealed. But also, in Guess 2, we have all but the last letter correct, and P is not in the word. So CHECK would have K at the end. But CHECK is a word. However, we have to check if K is allowed? We don't have any information against K.

But note: the last letter must not be E, P, R, or N. K is none of these.

Other possibilities:
- CHEAT: C H E A T -> T at the end. But we don't know about T? And T is not forbidden. CHEAT is a word.
- CHEAP: we already guessed and P is not in the word, so CHEAP is not the word.
- CHEWY: C H E W Y -> but then the fourth letter is W? No, we have A fixed at position 4. So CHEWY is C H E W Y, which doesn't have A at position 4. So no.
- CHELA: C H E L A -> but then the fifth letter is A? That would be two A's? But we have A at position 4, so if we put A at position 5, that would be a duplicate. But the word is ""chela"", which is C H E L A, so positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:L, 5:A. But in our case, we have A at position 4, so CHELA has L at position 4 and A at 5. But we need A at position 4, so that doesn't match.

We have fixed positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A. So the word must be ""C H E A ?"".

So the only letter we are missing is the fifth letter.

So the word is ""CHEA"" + one letter.

What letters can we add to ""CHEA"" to form a word?

- CHEAP: we know P is not in the word, so not this.
- CHEAT: T at the end -> ""CHEAT"" is a word.
- CHECK: K at the end -> ""CHECK"" is a word.
- CHEWY: doesn't fit because we need the fourth letter to be A, but CHEWY has W at 4 and Y at 5? No, CHEWY is C-H-E-W-Y, so position 4 is W, not A. So no.
- CHEVY: C H E V Y -> again, position 4 is V, not A. No.
- CHESS: C H E S S -> position 4 is S, not A. No.

So the only common words I can think of are:
- CHEAT (with T)
- CHECK (with K)

Are there others?
- CHEAP is out because of P.
- CHEEK: C H E E K -> but that has two E's? And position 4 is E, but we need A at position 4. So no.
- CHEER: similar, and also has R which is forbidden.
- CHEMO: C H E M O -> position 4 is M, not A. No.
- CHERT: has R and T, but position 4 is T? No, CHERT is C-H-E-R-T, so position 4 is R, not A. And R is forbidden.

So only CHEAT and CHECK come to mind.

But we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Now, from the feedback, we know that in the first guess, we had A in the word but not at position 2, and now we have A at position 4, which is consistent. Similarly, E is at position 3, which is consistent with not being at position 5.

Now, for the fifth letter, it must be a letter that is not E, P, R, or N.

So T and K are both possible.

But we need to choose one. However, we are to make a guess, so we can guess one of them.

But note: we have only one missing letter, so we can try to guess it.

But we have two possibilities: CHEAT and CHECK.

We need to see which one is more likely or if there are more.

Another word: CHEVY? No, as above.

Or CHELA? But CHELA is C-H-E-L-A, so if we put L at position 4 and A at 5, but we need A at position 4. So no.

What about ""CHEAP"" we already tried.

Perhaps ""CHERA"" is not a word.

So I think the only common words are CHEAT and CHECK.

But there's also ""CHEAP"" but P is excluded.

Another one: ""CHEFS"" -> C H E F S -> position 4 is F, not A. No.

So we have two candidates: CHEAT and CHECK.

Now, we have to choose one. We can use the fact that in the first guess, we had the letter E in the word but not at position 5. In CHEAT, the last letter is T, which is not E, so that's fine. Similarly for CHECK.

But we don't have any other information to distinguish.

We might also consider that CHECK has two C's. Is that possible? The first letter is C, and if the last letter is K, then there is no duplicate C? CHECK is C-H-E-C-K? Oh, wait! I think I made a mistake.

CHECK: 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: C? 
- Position 5: K

But in our pattern, we need position 4 to be A. But in CHECK, position 4 is C, not A. So that doesn't match.

I see, I confused myself.

We need the word to have A at position 4. So CHECK has C at position 4, not A. So CHECK is not a candidate.

Similarly, CHEAT has A at position 4? CHEAT: C-H-E-A-T, so:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: T

Yes, that matches.

Are there any other words?

What about ""CHEAP"" but P is out.

""CHERT"" has R and position 4 is R? No.

""CHESS"" has S at 4.

So is there another word ending with something else?

What about ""CHEVY""? C-H-E-V-Y -> position 4 is V, not A.

""CHINA"": C-H-I-N-A -> but N is forbidden, and position 3 is I, not E.

We need position 3 to be E.

So the word must be C H E A ?

So the only common word I can think of is CHEAT.

But is there ""CHEAM""? I don't think that's a word.

Or ""CHEAL""? Not a word.

""CHETA""? Not common.

So CHEAT seems to be the only common word.

But let me confirm: 
- CHEAT: a valid English word.

And it satisfies:
- Starts with C
- Second letter H (correct)
- Third letter E (correct)
- Fourth letter A (correct)
- Fifth letter T (which is not E, P, R, or N)

Also, from the first guess: 
- A is in the word and not at position 2: in CHEAT, A is at position 4, so correct.
- E is in the word and not at position 5: in CHEAT, E is at position 3, not 5, so correct.

And no R, N, or P.

So I think CHEAT is the word.

But we are to make a guess, so we can guess CHEAT.

But note: we have only one try? We have had two guesses, so we have four more? But we might solve it now.

But let's be cautious. Is there any other possibility?

Another word: ""CHEAP"" is out.

""CHERE""? C-H-E-R-E -> has R, and position 4 is R? No, and R is forbidden.

""CHIDE"": C-H-I-D-E -> position 3 is I, not E.

""CHASE"": C-H-A-S-E -> but position 3 is A? No, and also A is at position 3, but we need A at position 4? And position 4 is S. Also, in this word, A is at position 3, but we have E at position 5, which is forbidden? From first guess, E cannot be at position 5. But in CHASE, E is at position 5, so it would be invalid because of that.

Similarly, any word with E at position 5 is invalid.

So I think CHEAT is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we should guess CHEAT.

But to be thorough, let's see if there are any other words.

- CHEAP: invalid because of P and also we tried it.
- CHEAT: valid.
- CHECK: has C at position 4, not A.
- CHEEK: has E at position 4, not A.
- CHERE: has R and E at 5? C-H-E-R-E: position 4 is R, position 5 is E -> E at 5 is invalid and R is forbidden.
- CHERT: has R and position 4 is R? C-H-E-R-T -> position 4 is R, which is forbidden.
- CHESS: position 4 is S, not A.
- CHEST: position 4 is S, not A.
- CHEWY: position 4 is W, not A.

So no, I think CHEAT is the only one.

Therefore, we guess CHEAT.

Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - R and N are not in the word.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: CHEAP** → C(✓) H(✓) E(✓) A(✓) P(x)  
  - C, H, E, and A are all correct and in their respective positions (1, 2, 3, 4).  
  - P is not in the word.  

### Analysis:
- The secret word starts with **C**, has **H** in position 2, **E** in position 3, and **A** in position 4.  
- The word must be in the format: **C H E A ?** (only the 5th letter is unknown).  
- The 5th letter cannot be:  
  - **E** (from Guess 1 feedback: E not in position 5).  
  - **P** (from Guess 2 feedback: P not in word).  
  - **R** or **N** (from Guess 1 feedback: not in word).  
- The 5th letter must form a valid English word with ""CHEA"".  

### Possible Words:
- **CHEAT**: Ends with T, which is not excluded (T is not E, P, R, or N).  
- Other possibilities (e.g., CHEAP, CHECK) are invalid:  
  - CHEAP ends with P (excluded).  
  - CHECK has ""C"" in position 4 (not A) and is invalid.  
- No other common English words fit the pattern ""C H E A ?"" without using excluded letters.  

### Conclusion:
The only common English word that fits all constraints is **CHEAT**. This guess tests the only remaining unknown letter (T) and could solve the game if correct.

<guess>cheat</guess>",cheat,"We have feedback from two guesses:

Guess 1: CRANE
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- R: x (not in the word)
- A: - (in word, wrong position)
- N: x (not in word)
- E: - (in word, wrong position)

Guess 2: CHEAP
- C: ✓ (correct position)
- H: ✓ (correct position)
- E: ✓ (correct position)
- A: ✓ (correct position)
- P: x (not in word)

From Guess 1, we know:
- The first letter is C.
- A is in the word but not in position 2.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- R and N are not in the word.

From Guess 2:
- The first letter is C (confirmed again).
- The second letter is H (correct position).
- The third letter is E (correct position).
- The fourth letter is A (correct position).
- P is not in the word.

So, putting it together:
- The secret word starts with ""C"", has ""H"" in the second position, ""E"" in the third, and ""A"" in the fourth.
- The word must have five letters, so we are missing the fifth letter.
- We know the fifth letter cannot be E (from Guess 1) and cannot be P (from Guess 2). Also, it cannot be R or N (from Guess 1).

Therefore, the word so far is: C H E A ?

We need to find a 5-letter word that fits: ""C H E A ?"" and the last letter is not E, P, R, or N.

Additionally, from Guess 1, we know that A is not in position 2 (which is now H) and E is not in position 5 (which we are about to fill). Since we have A in position 4 and E in position 3, that satisfies the conditions from the first guess.

Now, what can the last letter be? It must be a letter that forms a valid English word with ""CHEA"" at the beginning.

Possible words:
- CHECK: but that would be C H E C K -> but we have two C's? The first C is fixed, and if we put C at the end, that would be a duplicate. But we don't know if duplicates are allowed? However, in the first guess, we had only one C and it was correct, so if there were another C, it might have been indicated? But we didn't have a second C in the guess. So it's possible. But let's see the feedback: in Guess 2, we have C at position 1 and no other C, so if the word had a C at the end, it wouldn't have been revealed. But also, in Guess 2, we have all but the last letter correct, and P is not in the word. So CHECK would have K at the end. But CHECK is a word. However, we have to check if K is allowed? We don't have any information against K.

But note: the last letter must not be E, P, R, or N. K is none of these.

Other possibilities:
- CHEAT: C H E A T -> T at the end. But we don't know about T? And T is not forbidden. CHEAT is a word.
- CHEAP: we already guessed and P is not in the word, so CHEAP is not the word.
- CHEWY: C H E W Y -> but then the fourth letter is W? No, we have A fixed at position 4. So CHEWY is C H E W Y, which doesn't have A at position 4. So no.
- CHELA: C H E L A -> but then the fifth letter is A? That would be two A's? But we have A at position 4, so if we put A at position 5, that would be a duplicate. But the word is ""chela"", which is C H E L A, so positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:L, 5:A. But in our case, we have A at position 4, so CHELA has L at position 4 and A at 5. But we need A at position 4, so that doesn't match.

We have fixed positions: 1:C, 2:H, 3:E, 4:A. So the word must be ""C H E A ?"".

So the only letter we are missing is the fifth letter.

So the word is ""CHEA"" + one letter.

What letters can we add to ""CHEA"" to form a word?

- CHEAP: we know P is not in the word, so not this.
- CHEAT: T at the end -> ""CHEAT"" is a word.
- CHECK: K at the end -> ""CHECK"" is a word.
- CHEWY: doesn't fit because we need the fourth letter to be A, but CHEWY has W at 4 and Y at 5? No, CHEWY is C-H-E-W-Y, so position 4 is W, not A. So no.
- CHEVY: C H E V Y -> again, position 4 is V, not A. No.
- CHESS: C H E S S -> position 4 is S, not A. No.

So the only common words I can think of are:
- CHEAT (with T)
- CHECK (with K)

Are there others?
- CHEAP is out because of P.
- CHEEK: C H E E K -> but that has two E's? And position 4 is E, but we need A at position 4. So no.
- CHEER: similar, and also has R which is forbidden.
- CHEMO: C H E M O -> position 4 is M, not A. No.
- CHERT: has R and T, but position 4 is T? No, CHERT is C-H-E-R-T, so position 4 is R, not A. And R is forbidden.

So only CHEAT and CHECK come to mind.

But we also have to consider that the word must be a valid English word.

Now, from the feedback, we know that in the first guess, we had A in the word but not at position 2, and now we have A at position 4, which is consistent. Similarly, E is at position 3, which is consistent with not being at position 5.

Now, for the fifth letter, it must be a letter that is not E, P, R, or N.

So T and K are both possible.

But we need to choose one. However, we are to make a guess, so we can guess one of them.

But note: we have only one missing letter, so we can try to guess it.

But we have two possibilities: CHEAT and CHECK.

We need to see which one is more likely or if there are more.

Another word: CHEVY? No, as above.

Or CHELA? But CHELA is C-H-E-L-A, so if we put L at position 4 and A at 5, but we need A at position 4. So no.

What about ""CHEAP"" we already tried.

Perhaps ""CHERA"" is not a word.

So I think the only common words are CHEAT and CHECK.

But there's also ""CHEAP"" but P is excluded.

Another one: ""CHEFS"" -> C H E F S -> position 4 is F, not A. No.

So we have two candidates: CHEAT and CHECK.

Now, we have to choose one. We can use the fact that in the first guess, we had the letter E in the word but not at position 5. In CHEAT, the last letter is T, which is not E, so that's fine. Similarly for CHECK.

But we don't have any other information to distinguish.

We might also consider that CHECK has two C's. Is that possible? The first letter is C, and if the last letter is K, then there is no duplicate C? CHECK is C-H-E-C-K? Oh, wait! I think I made a mistake.

CHECK: 
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: C? 
- Position 5: K

But in our pattern, we need position 4 to be A. But in CHECK, position 4 is C, not A. So that doesn't match.

I see, I confused myself.

We need the word to have A at position 4. So CHECK has C at position 4, not A. So CHECK is not a candidate.

Similarly, CHEAT has A at position 4? CHEAT: C-H-E-A-T, so:
- Position 1: C
- Position 2: H
- Position 3: E
- Position 4: A
- Position 5: T

Yes, that matches.

Are there any other words?

What about ""CHEAP"" but P is out.

""CHERT"" has R and position 4 is R? No.

""CHESS"" has S at 4.

So is there another word ending with something else?

What about ""CHEVY""? C-H-E-V-Y -> position 4 is V, not A.

""CHINA"": C-H-I-N-A -> but N is forbidden, and position 3 is I, not E.

We need position 3 to be E.

So the word must be C H E A ?

So the only common word I can think of is CHEAT.

But is there ""CHEAM""? I don't think that's a word.

Or ""CHEAL""? Not a word.

""CHETA""? Not common.

So CHEAT seems to be the only common word.

But let me confirm: 
- CHEAT: a valid English word.

And it satisfies:
- Starts with C
- Second letter H (correct)
- Third letter E (correct)
- Fourth letter A (correct)
- Fifth letter T (which is not E, P, R, or N)

Also, from the first guess: 
- A is in the word and not at position 2: in CHEAT, A is at position 4, so correct.
- E is in the word and not at position 5: in CHEAT, E is at position 3, not 5, so correct.

And no R, N, or P.

So I think CHEAT is the word.

But we are to make a guess, so we can guess CHEAT.

But note: we have only one try? We have had two guesses, so we have four more? But we might solve it now.

But let's be cautious. Is there any other possibility?

Another word: ""CHEAP"" is out.

""CHERE""? C-H-E-R-E -> has R, and position 4 is R? No, and R is forbidden.

""CHIDE"": C-H-I-D-E -> position 3 is I, not E.

""CHASE"": C-H-A-S-E -> but position 3 is A? No, and also A is at position 3, but we need A at position 4? And position 4 is S. Also, in this word, A is at position 3, but we have E at position 5, which is forbidden? From first guess, E cannot be at position 5. But in CHASE, E is at position 5, so it would be invalid because of that.

Similarly, any word with E at position 5 is invalid.

So I think CHEAT is the only common word that fits.

Therefore, we should guess CHEAT.

But to be thorough, let's see if there are any other words.

- CHEAP: invalid because of P and also we tried it.
- CHEAT: valid.
- CHECK: has C at position 4, not A.
- CHEEK: has E at position 4, not A.
- CHERE: has R and E at 5? C-H-E-R-E: position 4 is R, position 5 is E -> E at 5 is invalid and R is forbidden.
- CHERT: has R and position 4 is R? C-H-E-R-T -> position 4 is R, which is forbidden.
- CHESS: position 4 is S, not A.
- CHEST: position 4 is S, not A.
- CHEWY: position 4 is W, not A.

So no, I think CHEAT is the only one.

Therefore, we guess CHEAT.Based on the feedback from the previous guesses:

- **Guess 1: CRANE** → C(✓) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(-)  
  - C is correct and in position 1.  
  - R and N are not in the word.  
  - A is in the word but not in position 2.  
  - E is in the word but not in position 5.  

- **Guess 2: CHEAP** → C(✓) H(✓) E(✓) A(✓) P(x)  
  - C, H, E, and A are all correct and in their respective positions (1, 2, 3, 4).  
  - P is not in the word.  

### Analysis:
- The secret word starts with **C**, has **H** in position 2, **E** in position 3, and **A** in position 4.  
- The word must be in the format: **C H E A ?** (only the 5th letter is unknown).  
- The 5th letter cannot be:  
  - **E** (from Guess 1 feedback: E not in position 5).  
  - **P** (from Guess 2 feedback: P not in word).  
  - **R** or **N** (from Guess 1 feedback: not in word).  
- The 5th letter must form a valid English word with ""CHEA"".  

### Possible Words:
- **CHEAT**: Ends with T, which is not excluded (T is not E, P, R, or N).  
- Other possibilities (e.g., CHEAP, CHECK) are invalid:  
  - CHEAP ends with P (excluded).  
  - CHECK has ""C"" in position 4 (not A) and is invalid.  
- No other common English words fit the pattern ""C H E A ?"" without using excluded letters.  

### Conclusion:
The only common English word that fits all constraints is **CHEAT**. This guess tests the only remaining unknown letter (T) and could solve the game if correct.",Guess 3: cheat -> FEEDBACK: C(✓) H(✓) E(✓) A(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
