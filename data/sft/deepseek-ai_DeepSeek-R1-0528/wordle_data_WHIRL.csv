We are given feedback on the first guess ""crane"": 
 C(x) -> C is not in the secret word.
 R(-) -> R is in the word but not in the first position (since the feedback symbol is '-' meaning wrong position).
 A(x) -> A is not in the word.
 N(x) -> N is not in the word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the word.

 So, what we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position (because in ""crane"", R is in the second position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since R is present but not in the second position, it could be in the first, third, fourth, or fifth position.

 We must make a second guess that is a valid 5-letter word.

 We should avoid using C, A, N, E because they are absent.

 We know that R must be in the word but not in the second position. So we can try to place R in a different position.

 Also, we should use other common letters that haven't been tried yet. Since we've eliminated C, A, N, E, we can focus on other vowels and consonants.

 Remaining vowels: O, U, I (but note that A and E are out, so the vowel in the word might be one of O, U, I or even Y?).

 Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try a word that includes R in either the first, third, fourth, or fifth position, and uses other common letters.

 One idea: try R in the first position? But note the first letter of our guess ""crane"" was C and it was absent, so the first letter isn't C.

 Let's think of words that start with R? But we don't know if R is in the first position or not. We only know it's not in the second.

 Alternative: try to put R in the third position? 

 Example words: 
   Let's choose a word with R in the first position? For example, ""ROUST"" but we don't know if that's valid.

 We want to maximize information. We should try other common letters that we haven't tested.

 Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, etc.

 We can choose a word that has R and also includes S, T, L, O (for example).

 Since R must be present, we should include it in our next guess. We must avoid the second position for R.

 Possibilities: 
   Position 1: R _ _ _ _
   Position 3: _ _ R _ _
   Position 4: _ _ _ R _
   Position 5: _ _ _ _ R

 Since we have limited tries, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 I propose to place R in the first position to check if it's the first letter. If it is, we get a ✓, if not, then we know it's in another position.

 Let's try a word with R at the beginning and then use new common letters.

 Example: ""ROAST""
 But note: A is already eliminated (from the first feedback: A(x)), so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A. So ""ROAST"" is invalid because it has A.

 Another idea: ""ROTLS"" is not a word. Let's think of a valid word.

 How about ""RUSTY""? 
   R in first position, and letters U, S, T, Y. None of those have been tested (except we know S, T haven't been tested).

 But note: we haven't tested U, S, T, Y.

 Alternatively: ""ROOMY"" - but that has two O's and we don't want duplicates necessarily? Also, we don't know if O is in the word.

 Since we don't have much information, let's pick a word that uses all new letters and has R in a different position.

 But note: we must include R because we know it's present.

 Let me propose: 
   Place R in the third position? So the pattern: _ _ R _ _

 Example word: ""BIRTH"" - B, I, R, T, H. All new letters.

 But wait, the feedback said A(x) but we don't know about I? 

 However, we must consider: we haven't tested I, so it might be present.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPRIT"" but that's not a common word. Let me think of common words.

 Another idea: ""TRIES"" - T, R, I, E, S. But E is eliminated (feedback on first guess: E(x)), so we cannot use E.

 We must avoid E.

 Good point: avoid eliminated letters: C, A, N, E.

 So, ""TRIES"" has E -> invalid.

 How about ""TRIPS""? T, R, I, P, S.

 Let's check: 
   T: hasn't been tested.
   R: we know is present, and we'll put it in the second position? But wait, in ""crane"" we had R in the second position and it was wrong. Now in ""TRIPS"", R is in the second position again? But the feedback already said that R is not in the second position.

 Therefore, if we put R in the second position again, it would still be wrong. So that doesn't help.

 We need to try R in a different position.

 How about putting R in the first position? Then we test if R is the starting letter.

 Word: ""RHYME"" - but we have E (eliminated) and H and Y? 

 Without E: ""RHYMS"" is not a word.

 Another word: ""ROWDY"" - R, O, W, D, Y. 

 This uses O, W, D, Y, which are new.

 But note: we don't know about O.

 Alternatively: ""RUSTS"" - but duplicate S? Let me avoid duplicates for now.

 We want to maximize distinct letters.

 I'll pick ""ROWDY"": 
   R at position 1 (to test if the first letter is R)
   O: new letter (vowel alternative)
   W, D, Y: new letters.

 But wait, the word must be 5 letters. ""ROWDS"" isn't a word. What about ""ROWED""? But ""ROWED"" has E (eliminated).

 How about ""RUSTY"" again? It doesn't have eliminated letters: R, U, S, T, Y.

 Let me choose ""RUSTY"". 

 In ""RUSTY"": 
   R is in the first position -> if the secret word has R in the first, then we'll get a check. Otherwise, we'll know it's elsewhere.
   U, S, T, Y are all new and we'll get information about them.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that R is present but not in the second position. So if we put R in the first and it's the first letter of the secret, then we'll get a ✓. If not, then we'll get a '-' meaning it's in the word but wrong position (so then we know R is not in the first and not in the second, so it must be in 3,4, or 5).

 Also, we test U, S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, what about ""SPORT""? 
   S at first, P, O, R (at fourth position), T.

 That puts R in the fourth position. And we test S, P, O, R, T.

 But note: we already know R is present, so we are testing S, P, O, T.

 I think ""RUSTY"" is good because we test R in the first position and four new letters.

 Let me decide: guess ""RUSTY"".

 However, note that the secret word is 5 letters and we know one of them is R (but not at position 2). What if it has duplicate letters? We don't know.

 But ""RUSTY"" has no duplicates.

 So, next guess: ""RUSTY"".
</think>
Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are **not** in the secret word (x).
- R is in the word but **not in the second position** (-).

For the second guess:
- Must include R in a position other than the second (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Avoid C, A, N, E entirely.
- Use common untested letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, Y) to maximize information.
- Ideal word: Places R in a new position and includes new vowels/consonants.

Selected ""RUSTY"" because:
- Places R in position 1 (tests if R is the starting letter).
- Contains new letters U, S, T, Y (all untested).
- Valid 5-letter word, no duplicates or eliminated letters.

 Good point: avoid eliminated letters: C, A, N, E.

 So, ""TRIES"" has E -> invalid.

 How about ""TRIPS""? T, R, I, P, S.

 Let's check: 
   T: hasn't been tested.
   R: we know is present, and we'll put it in the second position? But wait, in ""crane"" we had R in the second position and it was wrong. Now in ""TRIPS"", R is in the second position again? But the feedback already said that R is not in the second position.

 Therefore, if we put R in the second position again, it would still be wrong. So that doesn't help.

 We need to try R in a different position.

 How about putting R in the first position? Then we test if R is the starting letter.

 Word: ""RHYME"" - but we have E (eliminated) and H and Y? 

 Without E: ""RHYMS"" is not a word.

 Another word: ""ROWDY"" - R, O, W, D, Y. 

 This uses O, W, D, Y, which are new.

 But note: we don't know about O.

 Alternatively: ""RUSTS"" - but duplicate S? Let me avoid duplicates for now.

 We want to maximize distinct letters.

 I'll pick ""ROWDY"": 
   R at position 1 (to test if the first letter is R)
   O: new letter (vowel alternative)
   W, D, Y: new letters.

 But wait, the word must be 5 letters. ""ROWDS"" isn't a word. What about ""ROWED""? But ""ROWED"" has E (eliminated).

 How about ""RUSTY"" again? It doesn't have eliminated letters: R, U, S, T, Y.

 Let me choose ""RUSTY"". 

 In ""RUSTY"": 
   R is in the first position -> if the secret word has R in the first, then we'll get a check. Otherwise, we'll know it's elsewhere.
   U, S, T, Y are all new and we'll get information about them.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that R is present but not in the second position. So if we put R in the first and it's the first letter of the secret, then we'll get a ✓. If not, then we'll get a '-' meaning it's in the word but wrong position (so then we know R is not in the first and not in the second, so it must be in 3,4, or 5).

 Also, we test U, S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, what about ""SPORT""? 
   S at first, P, O, R (at fourth position), T.

 That puts R in the fourth position. And we test S, P, O, R, T.

 But note: we already know R is present, so we are testing S, P, O, T.

 I think ""RUSTY"" is good because we test R in the first position and four new letters.

 Let me decide: guess ""RUSTY"".

 However, note that the secret word is 5 letters and we know one of them is R (but not at position 2). What if it has duplicate letters? We don't know.

 But ""RUSTY"" has no duplicates.

 So, next guess: ""RUSTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are **not** in the secret word (x).
- R is in the word but **not in the second position** (-).

For the second guess:
- Must include R in a position other than the second (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Avoid C, A, N, E entirely.
- Use common untested letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, Y) to maximize information.
- Ideal word: Places R in a new position and includes new vowels/consonants.

Selected ""RUSTY"" because:
- Places R in position 1 (tests if R is the starting letter).
- Contains new letters U, S, T, Y (all untested).
- Valid 5-letter word, no duplicates or eliminated letters.

We have two guesses and feedback:
1. ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x) → R is present but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
2. ""rusty"": R(-) U(x) S(x) T(x) Y(x) → R is present but not in position 1 (since we got '-' for R in the first position). U, S, T, Y are absent.

What we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but it is not in position 1 or 2. So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, Y. So the secret word uses only letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Since R is present and must be in positions 3, 4, or 5, we need to form a word that includes R in one of these positions and uses only the available letters.

Moreover, we have no information about other letters, so we should test as many new common letters as possible from the remaining set.

Common letters in the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, W. (We can avoid very rare letters like J, Q, X, Z for now.)

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (but common ones preferred).

Options:
- R in position 3: pattern _ _ R _ _
  - Examples: ""FIREW"" not a word; ""PIROG"" not common; ""MORPH"" — let's check: M, O, R, P, H. All available letters. Also, ""MORPH"" is a valid English word.
- R in position 4: pattern _ _ _ R _
  - Examples: ""LINER"" but E is absent (invalid); ""HUMOR"" but U is absent (invalid). Since E and U are out, we need words without these. ""VOTER"" has E (invalid). ""MAJOR"" — J might be uncommon? We can try ""FLOOR"" but duplicate O? ""FLORA"" — but A is absent. So difficult for position 4.
- R in position 5: pattern _ _ _ _ R
  - Examples: ""VENIR"" not a word; ""TAPIR"" but A is absent; ""MANOR"" — but M, A, N: A and N are absent. ""FLOUR"" but U is absent. ""CHOIR"" has C and H; C is absent. So also difficult.

Given the constraints, placing R in position 3 might be easier. Therefore, ""MORPH"" is a candidate.

Let me verify if ""MORPH"" is acceptable:
- Letters: M, O, R, P, H. All are in the available set? Yes, because we haven't tested them and C,A,N,E,U,S,T,Y are out.
- Position: R in position 3.

Alternatively, another word: ""BORIC"" — but C is absent. ""FORMY"" not a word. ""WORRY"" has double R? But R is already known to be present, so duplicates might be possible? However, feedback doesn’t indicate duplicates unless the secret has duplicates. Since we don't know, we can avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""LIRIP"" not a word. ""MOREL"" but has E (invalid). ""PORCH"" has C (invalid).

So ""MORPH"" seems good.

We could try ""GROWL"" — G, R, O, W, L. But R in position 2? But we must avoid position 2 because feedback on ""crane"" said R is not in position 2, and ""rusty"" confirmed R not in position 1. In ""GROWL"", R is in position 2? So we wouldn't get ✓ for R? And position 2 is already bad, so we should not put R in position 2.

In ""MORPH"": R is in position 3, so if the secret word has R in position 3, it will be ✓. If not, it will be '-' only if R is in the word but not in that position? But we know R is in the word, and it must be in 3,4, or5. So if not in position 3, then it must be in 4 or 5. But the feedback will tell us by a '-' or ✓.

Another candidate: ""FORUM"" has U (invalid). ""MILOR"" not common. ""DROPS"" has S (invalid). ""PROBE"" has E (invalid). So ""MORPH"" is valid.

Alternatively, ""HORDE"" has E (invalid). ""FORKS"" has S (invalid).

Therefore, I'll choose ""MORPH"".

But let me consider if there's a better word to test more common letters. In ""MORPH"", we test M, O, P, H (and R). We haven't tested any of these.

We could try ""GROIN"" — but O is new, I is new, but N is absent? N was eliminated in first guess. ""GROIN"" has N -> invalid.

""FLORA"" has A -> invalid.

So ""MORPH"" seems a good choice.

We could also consider ""ROWDY"" but we didn't use it last time, and it has Y? But Y was tested in ""rusty"" and is absent. So we can't use Y.

Therefore, final decision: guess ""MORPH""

Thought process summary:
- R must be in positions 3,4, or5.
- Eliminated letters: C,A,N,E,U,S,T,Y.
- Chose ""MORPH"" because it places R in position 3 and uses new letters M,O,P,H, all from available set.

- From ""crane"": R is in the secret word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.

 N(x) -> N is not in the word.
 E(x) -> E is not in the word.

 So, what we know:
 - The secret word contains the letter R, but not in the second position (because in ""crane"", R is in the second position).
 - The letters C, A, N, E are not in the secret word at all.

 Since R is present but not in the second position, it could be in the first, third, fourth, or fifth position.

 We must make a second guess that is a valid 5-letter word.

 We should avoid using C, A, N, E because they are absent.

 We know that R must be in the word but not in the second position. So we can try to place R in a different position.

 Also, we should use other common letters that haven't been tried yet. Since we've eliminated C, A, N, E, we can focus on other vowels and consonants.

 Remaining vowels: O, U, I (but note that A and E are out, so the vowel in the word might be one of O, U, I or even Y?).

 Common consonants left: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

 We can try a word that includes R in either the first, third, fourth, or fifth position, and uses other common letters.

 One idea: try R in the first position? But note the first letter of our guess ""crane"" was C and it was absent, so the first letter isn't C.

 Let's think of words that start with R? But we don't know if R is in the first position or not. We only know it's not in the second.

 Alternative: try to put R in the third position? 

 Example words: 
   Let's choose a word with R in the first position? For example, ""ROUST"" but we don't know if that's valid.

 We want to maximize information. We should try other common letters that we haven't tested.

 Common letters not yet tested: S, T, L, etc.

 We can choose a word that has R and also includes S, T, L, O (for example).

 Since R must be present, we should include it in our next guess. We must avoid the second position for R.

 Possibilities: 
   Position 1: R _ _ _ _
   Position 3: _ _ R _ _
   Position 4: _ _ _ R _
   Position 5: _ _ _ _ R

 Since we have limited tries, we want to cover as many new letters as possible.

 I propose to place R in the first position to check if it's the first letter. If it is, we get a ✓, if not, then we know it's in another position.

 Let's try a word with R at the beginning and then use new common letters.

 Example: ""ROAST""
 But note: A is already eliminated (from the first feedback: A(x)), so we cannot use A.

 We must avoid A. So ""ROAST"" is invalid because it has A.

 Another idea: ""ROTLS"" is not a word. Let's think of a valid word.

 How about ""RUSTY""? 
   R in first position, and letters U, S, T, Y. None of those have been tested (except we know S, T haven't been tested).

 But note: we haven't tested U, S, T, Y.

 Alternatively: ""ROOMY"" - but that has two O's and we don't want duplicates necessarily? Also, we don't know if O is in the word.

 Since we don't have much information, let's pick a word that uses all new letters and has R in a different position.

 But note: we must include R because we know it's present.

 Let me propose: 
   Place R in the third position? So the pattern: _ _ R _ _

 Example word: ""BIRTH"" - B, I, R, T, H. All new letters.

 But wait, the feedback said A(x) but we don't know about I? 

 However, we must consider: we haven't tested I, so it might be present.

 Alternatively, we can try ""SPRIT"" but that's not a common word. Let me think of common words.

 Another idea: ""TRIES"" - T, R, I, E, S. But E is eliminated (feedback on first guess: E(x)), so we cannot use E.

 We must avoid E.

 Good point: avoid eliminated letters: C, A, N, E.

 So, ""TRIES"" has E -> invalid.

 How about ""TRIPS""? T, R, I, P, S.

 Let's check: 
   T: hasn't been tested.
   R: we know is present, and we'll put it in the second position? But wait, in ""crane"" we had R in the second position and it was wrong. Now in ""TRIPS"", R is in the second position again? But the feedback already said that R is not in the second position.

 Therefore, if we put R in the second position again, it would still be wrong. So that doesn't help.

 We need to try R in a different position.

 How about putting R in the first position? Then we test if R is the starting letter.

 Word: ""RHYME"" - but we have E (eliminated) and H and Y? 

 Without E: ""RHYMS"" is not a word.

 Another word: ""ROWDY"" - R, O, W, D, Y. 

 This uses O, W, D, Y, which are new.

 But note: we don't know about O.

 Alternatively: ""RUSTS"" - but duplicate S? Let me avoid duplicates for now.

 We want to maximize distinct letters.

 I'll pick ""ROWDY"": 
   R at position 1 (to test if the first letter is R)
   O: new letter (vowel alternative)
   W, D, Y: new letters.

 But wait, the word must be 5 letters. ""ROWDS"" isn't a word. What about ""ROWED""? But ""ROWED"" has E (eliminated).

 How about ""RUSTY"" again? It doesn't have eliminated letters: R, U, S, T, Y.

 Let me choose ""RUSTY"". 

 In ""RUSTY"": 
   R is in the first position -> if the secret word has R in the first, then we'll get a check. Otherwise, we'll know it's elsewhere.
   U, S, T, Y are all new and we'll get information about them.

 But note: the feedback for ""crane"" told us that R is present but not in the second position. So if we put R in the first and it's the first letter of the secret, then we'll get a ✓. If not, then we'll get a '-' meaning it's in the word but wrong position (so then we know R is not in the first and not in the second, so it must be in 3,4, or 5).

 Also, we test U, S, T, Y.

 Alternatively, what about ""SPORT""? 
   S at first, P, O, R (at fourth position), T.

 That puts R in the fourth position. And we test S, P, O, R, T.

 But note: we already know R is present, so we are testing S, P, O, T.

 I think ""RUSTY"" is good because we test R in the first position and four new letters.

 Let me decide: guess ""RUSTY"".

 However, note that the secret word is 5 letters and we know one of them is R (but not at position 2). What if it has duplicate letters? We don't know.

 But ""RUSTY"" has no duplicates.

 So, next guess: ""RUSTY"".Based on the feedback from the first guess ""crane"":
- C, A, N, and E are **not** in the secret word (x).
- R is in the word but **not in the second position** (-).

For the second guess:
- Must include R in a position other than the second (positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).
- Avoid C, A, N, E entirely.
- Use common untested letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, U, Y) to maximize information.
- Ideal word: Places R in a new position and includes new vowels/consonants.

Selected ""RUSTY"" because:
- Places R in position 1 (tests if R is the starting letter).
- Contains new letters U, S, T, Y (all untested).
- Valid 5-letter word, no duplicates or eliminated letters.

<guess>rusty</guess><｜end▁of▁sentence｜><｜User｜>Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: crane -> FEEDBACK: C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x)
Guess 2: rusty -> FEEDBACK: R(-) U(x) S(x) T(x) Y(x)
<｜Assistant｜>We have two guesses and feedback:
1. ""crane"": C(x) R(-) A(x) N(x) E(x) → R is present but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
2. ""rusty"": R(-) U(x) S(x) T(x) Y(x) → R is present but not in position 1 (since we got '-' for R in the first position). U, S, T, Y are absent.

What we know:
- The secret word contains the letter R, but it is not in position 1 or 2. So R must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, Y. So the secret word uses only letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Since R is present and must be in positions 3, 4, or 5, we need to form a word that includes R in one of these positions and uses only the available letters.

Moreover, we have no information about other letters, so we should test as many new common letters as possible from the remaining set.

Common letters in the remaining set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, W. (We can avoid very rare letters like J, Q, X, Z for now.)

We need a word that:
- Has R in position 3, 4, or 5.
- Uses letters from the available set: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z (but common ones preferred).

Options:
- R in position 3: pattern _ _ R _ _
  - Examples: ""FIREW"" not a word; ""PIROG"" not common; ""MORPH"" — let's check: M, O, R, P, H. All available letters. Also, ""MORPH"" is a valid English word.
- R in position 4: pattern _ _ _ R _
  - Examples: ""LINER"" but E is absent (invalid); ""HUMOR"" but U is absent (invalid). Since E and U are out, we need words without these. ""VOTER"" has E (invalid). ""MAJOR"" — J might be uncommon? We can try ""FLOOR"" but duplicate O? ""FLORA"" — but A is absent. So difficult for position 4.
- R in position 5: pattern _ _ _ _ R
  - Examples: ""VENIR"" not a word; ""TAPIR"" but A is absent; ""MANOR"" — but M, A, N: A and N are absent. ""FLOUR"" but U is absent. ""CHOIR"" has C and H; C is absent. So also difficult.

Given the constraints, placing R in position 3 might be easier. Therefore, ""MORPH"" is a candidate.

Let me verify if ""MORPH"" is acceptable:
- Letters: M, O, R, P, H. All are in the available set? Yes, because we haven't tested them and C,A,N,E,U,S,T,Y are out.
- Position: R in position 3.

Alternatively, another word: ""BORIC"" — but C is absent. ""FORMY"" not a word. ""WORRY"" has double R? But R is already known to be present, so duplicates might be possible? However, feedback doesn’t indicate duplicates unless the secret has duplicates. Since we don't know, we can avoid duplicates for now.

Another word: ""LIRIP"" not a word. ""MOREL"" but has E (invalid). ""PORCH"" has C (invalid).

So ""MORPH"" seems good.

We could try ""GROWL"" — G, R, O, W, L. But R in position 2? But we must avoid position 2 because feedback on ""crane"" said R is not in position 2, and ""rusty"" confirmed R not in position 1. In ""GROWL"", R is in position 2? So we wouldn't get ✓ for R? And position 2 is already bad, so we should not put R in position 2.

In ""MORPH"": R is in position 3, so if the secret word has R in position 3, it will be ✓. If not, it will be '-' only if R is in the word but not in that position? But we know R is in the word, and it must be in 3,4, or5. So if not in position 3, then it must be in 4 or 5. But the feedback will tell us by a '-' or ✓.

Another candidate: ""FORUM"" has U (invalid). ""MILOR"" not common. ""DROPS"" has S (invalid). ""PROBE"" has E (invalid). So ""MORPH"" is valid.

Alternatively, ""HORDE"" has E (invalid). ""FORKS"" has S (invalid).

Therefore, I'll choose ""MORPH"".

But let me consider if there's a better word to test more common letters. In ""MORPH"", we test M, O, P, H (and R). We haven't tested any of these.

We could try ""GROIN"" — but O is new, I is new, but N is absent? N was eliminated in first guess. ""GROIN"" has N -> invalid.

""FLORA"" has A -> invalid.

So ""MORPH"" seems a good choice.

We could also consider ""ROWDY"" but we didn't use it last time, and it has Y? But Y was tested in ""rusty"" and is absent. So we can't use Y.

Therefore, final decision: guess ""MORPH""

Thought process summary:
- R must be in positions 3,4, or5.
- Eliminated letters: C,A,N,E,U,S,T,Y.
- Chose ""MORPH"" because it places R in position 3 and uses new letters M,O,P,H, all from available set.Based on the previous feedback:
- From ""crane"": R is in the secret word but not in position 2. C, A, N, E are absent.
- From ""rusty"": R is not in position 1. U, S, T, Y are absent.
- Therefore, R must be in position 3, 4, or 5 of the secret word.
- Absent letters: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, Y.
- Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

For the third guess:
- Must include R in position 3, 4, or 5 to test its location.
- Use common untested letters from the available set to maximize information.
- Selected ""MORPH"" because:
  - R is in position 3 (testing if R is in position 3; if not, it will reveal position 4 or 5).
  - Letters M, O, P, H are all new and common untested in the available set.
  - Valid 5-letter word with no duplicates or eliminated letters.

""FORKS"" has S (invalid).\n\nTherefore, I\'ll choose ""MORPH"".\n\nBut let me consider if there\'s a better word to test more common letters. In ""MORPH"", we test M, O, P, H (and R). We haven\'t tested any of these.\n\nWe could try ""GROIN"" — but O is new, I is new, but N is absent? N was eliminated in first guess. ""GROIN"" has N -> invalid.\n\n""FLORA"" has A -> invalid.\n\nSo ""MORPH"" seems a good choice.\n\nWe could also consider ""ROWDY"" but we didn\'t use it last time, and it has Y?

We have three guesses and their feedback:

1. ""crane"": 
   - C(x) → not in word
   - R(-) → in word, but not in position 2
   - A(x) → not in word
   - N(x) → not in word
   - E(x) → not in word

2. ""rusty"":
   - R(-) → in word, but not in position 1 (since position 1 gave '-', meaning wrong position)
   - U(x) → not in word
   - S(x) → not in word
   - T(x) → not in word
   - Y(x) → not in word

3. ""morph"":
   - M(x) → not in word
   - O(x) → not in word
   - R(-) → in word, but not in position 3 (since R is the third letter in ""morph"" and feedback is '-')
   - P(x) → not in word
   - H(-) → in word, but not in position 5 (since H is the fifth letter in ""morph"" and feedback is '-')

From all feedback, we know:

- **Letters not in the word:** C, A, N, E, U, S, T, Y, M, O, P. So absent letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, P, S, T, U, Y.

- **Letters in the word:** 
  - R: present, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since from ""crane"" position 2 was wrong, from ""rusty"" position 1 was wrong, and from ""morph"" position 3 was wrong). So R must be in position 4 or 5.
  - H: present, but not in position 5 (from ""morph"" feedback). Since H is present and not in position 5, and the word is 5-letter, H must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We have only two known present letters: R and H.

Also, we know the secret word does not contain any of the absent letters, so available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note H is already known present.

However, we have only tested H and R so far? Actually, we haven't tested B, D, F, G, I, K, L, etc., except for the letters we know are absent.

Let me list the available alphabet: B, D, F, G, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z, and H is confirmed present but position unknown, and R is present and must be in position 4 or 5.

We also know H cannot be in position 5 (from ""morph""). So positions for H: 1, 2, or 3? Or 4? Since position 5 is ruled out.

But R is in 4 or 5. If R is in 4, then H cannot be in 4 because two letters can't occupy the same position? But we don't know if duplicates exist. So far, we have no evidence of duplicates.

We should avoid assuming no duplicates unless necessary.

Given this, let's think:

- Position 4: Could have R or H? Or both? But they are different letters.

- Position 5: Only if R is there, but if R is in position 5, then position 4 could have H? 

We must find a word containing H and R, with R in position 4 or 5, and H in one of the other positions except 5 (since H cannot be in 5). Also, use other available letters.

Moreover, since R is in position 4 or 5:

Case 1: R in position 4 → secret word pattern: _ _ _ R _
Case 2: R in position 5 → secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ R

And H must be in another position: 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but if R is in 4, then H cannot be in 4). Similarly, if R is in 5, then H could be in 4?

But from feedback, H cannot be in position 5. So:

- If R in position 4, then H can be in position 1, 2, or 3 (position 4 taken by R, position 5 invalid for H).
- If R in position 5, then H can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also have to find a valid word using only available letters: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,Q,V,W,X,Z (and H,R).

We should test additional common letters to get more information.

Since we know H and R are present, we can try a word that:

- Places R in position 4 or 5 (we need to guess which one).
- Places H in one of the first three positions if R is in 4, or anywhere but 5 if R is in 5.
- And uses three new letters from the available set to test them.

But to cover more possibilities, we can focus on R in position 5 first? Or position 4?

Let me look for words with R in position 5: e.g., pattern ending with R.

Words: _ _ _ _ R → and contain H in 1,2,3, or 4.

Examples:
- ""BLHIR"" not a word.
- ""LAVHR"" not a word.
- ""VIGHR"" not a word.

We need valid words. Let me try words ending in R:

Common words: ""PAPER"" but contains A and E? Absent.
Other words: ""LADER"" not a word, and contains E? ""BAGER"" no.

Words without absent letters: available consonants B,D,F,G,K,L,V,W etc., and vowels? Vowels left: I, O? But O is absent? Yes, O is absent (from ""morph"" feedback: O(x)). So vowels available: only I? Because A, E, O, U are absent? U is absent from ""rusty"", A,E,O absent.

So only possible vowel is I? Or sometimes Y but Y is absent. So words must use I as vowel? And possibly no vowel? Not necessarily.

Available vowels: Only I. Because Y is absent (from ""rusty""). And sometimes W might act as vowel? But doubtful.

So the secret word likely contains the letter I? We don't know. We haven't tested I yet.

Therefore, we should test I as well? But we can't test all letters at once.

Similarly, let's look for words with R in position 4: pattern _ _ _ R _

Words: three letters before R, one after. The H must be in one of the first three positions.

Example: fill with H in position 1: H _ _ R _ → e.g., ""HILDR"" not word, ""HIBER"" has E? ""HAF R"" no.

Without E: ""WHIRL"" → W, H, I, R, L → but position: H is in position 2? And R in 4? 

Word: ""WHIRL"": 
  W at 1? 
  H at 2? 
  I at 3? 
  R at 4? 
  L at 5? 

But this uses W, H, I, R, L.

Check letters: H and R we know are in, I, W, L are new.

Also, all letters are available (W, H, I, R, L) — H is okay because we know it's present, but we're testing its position.

In ""WHIRL"":
  - Position 2: H? We don't know yet.
  - Position 4: R? We are testing R in position 4.

This seems plausible.

Another option with R in position 4: ""ZEBRA"" but E absent and A absent? ""THIRD"" has T? T is absent from ""rusty""? Wait, from ""rusty"" T(x), so absent. So ""THIRD"" has T? Invalid.

How about ""FLORA""? A absent.

Another word: ""DRINK"" has D,R,I,N,K — N is absent? Yes, from ""crane"" N(x). So invalid.

""FIRED"" has E? Absent.

""GLORY"" has O and Y? Both absent.

So ""WHIRL"" might work.

With R in position 5: try ""BLOOD"" but O absent? And not R? Let's find words ending R.

""AVAIL"" no R? ""JIGOR"" not word. ""VIZIR"" not common. ""VALIDR"" too long.

More common: ""LABOR"" has A? Absent. ""RADAR"" has A? Absent. ""DEMUR"" has E? Absent. ""PURER"" has U and E? Both absent. ""GIVER"" has E? Absent. ""BRIAR"" has A? Absent.

So words ending in R without absent letters are few? Another: ""FLAIR"" has A? Absent. ""STAIR"" has A,S,T? All absent.

Therefore, words with R in position 4 might be easier to find? So I'll go with ""WHIRL"".

In ""WHIRL"":
- Position 2: H. We know H is present but not in position 5? So position 2 is fine? We don't know if position 2 is correct, but it might be.
- Position 4: R. If the secret word has R in position 4, this will get a check? If R is in position 5, then R at position 4 will be marked '-' meaning wrong position, but since we know R is present, and if it's not in 4, it must be in 5? Then we'll confirm R in 5.

Then we can test it? Also, we test W, I, L.

But note: if we place H in position 2 and it's correct, we get a check? Otherwise '-' meaning H present but wrong position.

So we can get information.

Alternatively, if we are unsure about R in position 4, we can choose a word where R is in position 5? But earlier I couldn't find many valid words.

Another word with R in position 5: How about ""DEAR "" with E? Invalid.

""HAIR ""? But need 5 letters. ""HAIK"" not 5 letters.

""GHORR"" not word.

Perhaps ""CHOIR"" has C? Absent.

""QUAIR"" not common? ""BRINR"" no.

Actually, good word: ""KWIRL"" not word. ""WHIRL"" is for R in position 4? 

Another idea: ""HIDER"" but E absent? And R at end? Actually, ""HIDER"" has E? Not valid.

So perhaps ""WHIRL"" is our best bet? But W might be uncommon? But it's a valid English word.

Another word: ""VIRAL"" has A? Absent.

""LIBRA"" has A? Absent.

So instead of ""WHIRL"", what about ""FRISK""? But F,R,I,S,K — S is absent? From ""rusty"" S(x)? Yes, S absent. So invalid.

""BLIND"" no R? Needs R.

So ""WHIRL"" seems okay.

But let's consider if R is in position 5, what word? ""MUHIR"" not word. ""GUIR?"" no.

Perhaps ""WIR R"" no. Difficult.

I think ""WHIRL"" is acceptable.

Therefore, next guess: ""WHIRL"" 

But note: in feedback from ""morph"", H was marked '-' at position 5? We know H cannot be in position 5? In ""WHIRL"", H is in position 2? That's fine.

Also, the word ""whirl"" uses W, H, I, R, L — all available or required (H and R).

No absent letters.

So it's valid.

Let me confirm: 
- W: not tested, so we'll learn if it's present.
- H: we know present, testing position 2.
- I: new letter.
- R: in position 4? We test R at position 4.
- L: new letter.

Good.

But note: if R is in position 5, then in ""WHIRL"", R is in position 4? So we'll get '-' meaning R is present but not in position 4? Then we'll know R must be in position 5? And similarly for H: if we get '-' or ✓.

So informative.

Thus, I'll go with ""WHIRL"".

But the pattern: if secret word has R in position 5, and H in position 2? But wait, the secret word might not have H in position 2? We're testing.

It's fine.

So next guess: ""whirl""

But in uppercase: ""WHIRL""

</think>
Based on the feedback from previous guesses:

- **Absent Letters**: C, A, N, E, U, S, T, Y, M, O, P (from ""x"" feedback).
- **Present Letters**: 
  - R is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from positions 2, 1, and 3 being ""-"" in ""crane"", ""rusty"", and ""morph"" respectively). R must be in position 4 or 5.
  - H is in the word but not in position 5 (from ""-"" at position 5 in ""morph""). H must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Since R is in position 4 or 5, and H is in another position, the chosen guess tests:
- R in position 4 (to check if R is in position 4 vs. 5).
- H in position 2 (a plausible position since position 1 hasn't been tested yet for H).
- Includes new letters W, I, and L (untested and available) to maximize information.
- Uses only allowed letters from the remaining alphabet: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W X, Z.

The word ""WHIRL"" was selected because:
- It is a valid 5-letter word with no duplicated or absent letters.
- It places R in position 4 and H in position 2 for testing.
- Letters W, I, and L cover common untested options.

<guess>WHIRL</guess>",WHIRL,"We have three guesses and their feedback:

1. ""crane"": 
   - C(x) → not in word
   - R(-) → in word, but not in position 2
   - A(x) → not in word
   - N(x) → not in word
   - E(x) → not in word

2. ""rusty"":
   - R(-) → in word, but not in position 1 (since position 1 gave '-', meaning wrong position)
   - U(x) → not in word
   - S(x) → not in word
   - T(x) → not in word
   - Y(x) → not in word

3. ""morph"":
   - M(x) → not in word
   - O(x) → not in word
   - R(-) → in word, but not in position 3 (since R is the third letter in ""morph"" and feedback is '-')
   - P(x) → not in word
   - H(-) → in word, but not in position 5 (since H is the fifth letter in ""morph"" and feedback is '-')

From all feedback, we know:

- **Letters not in the word:** C, A, N, E, U, S, T, Y, M, O, P. So absent letters: A, C, E, M, N, O, P, S, T, U, Y.

- **Letters in the word:** 
  - R: present, but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since from ""crane"" position 2 was wrong, from ""rusty"" position 1 was wrong, and from ""morph"" position 3 was wrong). So R must be in position 4 or 5.
  - H: present, but not in position 5 (from ""morph"" feedback). Since H is present and not in position 5, and the word is 5-letter, H must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We have only two known present letters: R and H.

Also, we know the secret word does not contain any of the absent letters, so available letters are: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, V, W, X, Z. But note H is already known present.

However, we have only tested H and R so far? Actually, we haven't tested B, D, F, G, I, K, L, etc., except for the letters we know are absent.

We also know H cannot be in position 5 (from ""morph""). So positions for H: 1, 2, or 3? Or 4? Since position 5 is ruled out.

But R is in 4 or 5. If R is in 4, then H cannot be in 4 because two letters can't occupy the same position? But we don't know if duplicates exist. So far, we have no evidence of duplicates.

We should avoid assuming no duplicates unless necessary.

Given this, let's think:

- Position 4: Could have R or H? Or both? But they are different letters.

- Position 5: Only if R is there, but if R is in position 5, then position 4 could have H? 

We must find a word containing H and R, with R in position 4 or 5, and H in one of the other positions except 5 (since H cannot be in 5). Also, use other available letters.

Moreover, since R is in position 4 or 5:

Case 1: R in position 4 → secret word pattern: _ _ _ R _
Case 2: R in position 5 → secret word pattern: _ _ _ _ R

And H must be in another position: 1, 2, 3, or 4 (but if R is in 4, then H cannot be in 4). Similarly, if R is in 5, then H could be in 4?

But from feedback, H cannot be in position 5. So:

- If R in position 4, then H can be in position 1, 2, or 3 (position 4 taken by R, position 5 invalid for H).
- If R in position 5, then H can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

We also have to find a valid word using only available letters: B,D,F,G,I,J,K,L,Q,V,W,X,Z (and H,R).

We should test additional common letters to get more information.
