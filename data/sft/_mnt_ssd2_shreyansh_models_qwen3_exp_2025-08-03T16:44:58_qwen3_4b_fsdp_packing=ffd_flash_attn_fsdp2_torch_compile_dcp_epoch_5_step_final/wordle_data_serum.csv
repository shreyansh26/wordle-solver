### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions to test.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so R is not in position 1)
- A, I are NOT in the word
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is not in position 4)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is not in position 5)

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: R, S, E
- Letters NOT in the word: A, I
- Positions to avoid for these letters:
  - R cannot be in position 1
  - S cannot be in position 4
  - E cannot be in position 5

I need a new 5-letter word that contains R, S, E (each at least once) and does not contain A or I. Also, I need to place R, S, E in different positions than the ones tried before.

Let me think of a word that fits these constraints. ""STORE"" comes to mind:
- Contains S, T, O, R, E
- Does not contain A or I
- R is in position 4 (was in position 1 before, so new position)
- S is in position 1 (was in position 4 before, so new position)
- E is in position 5 (but this is the same position as before, which was marked wrong, so this is bad)

""TRIES"" might work:
- T, R, I, E, S
- But I is not allowed (was marked x in feedback)

""STARE"" has A, which is not allowed.

""SERVE"":
- S, E, R, V, E
- Contains E twice, but that's okay
- R in position 3 (new)
- S in position 1 (new)
- E in position 2 and 5 (but E cannot be in position 5, so this is bad)

""REACT"" has A, which is not allowed.

""CRSER"" is not a valid word.

""TRIES"" has I, which is not allowed.

""EXTRA"" has A, which is not allowed.

""ERST"" is 4 letters.

""STERN"":
- S, T, E, R, N

From the combined feedback:

Letters we know are in the word: S (fixed in position 1), R, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, I, T, N  

Positions still unknown for R and E:  
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 4  
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5  

The word so far looks like:  
S _ _ _ _  

We need to place R and E plus two more distinct letters (cannot be A, I, T, N).  
Good remaining consonants: D, L, C, H, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A and I are out, and E is already in).

Let’s try to keep R and E in new positions and test two fresh consonants.  
A promising pattern is S _ E _ _ or S _ _ E _ , but E can’t be in 5.  
Let’s try S _ _ E _ , but E in 4 is allowed.  

Word that fits:  
S C O R E  
- S in 1 (✓)  
- C, O new letters  
- R in 4 (was in 1 and 4 in earlier guesses, but feedback for 4 was “-” so 4 is wrong for R; thus R must be in 2 or 3)  
Wait, R cannot be in 4 (from STERN feedback R(-) in 4), and cannot be in 1 (from RAISE feedback R(-) in 1). So R must be in 2 or 3.  

Let’s try R in 2: S R _ _ _  
Then place E somewhere E can go (not 3 or 5). Possible positions: 3 is out for E (feedback from RAISE: E(-) in 5, but 3 wasn’t tested yet). Wait, E was only marked wrong in 5 (from RAISE) and in 3 (from STERN). So E can be in 2 or 4.  

But R needs to be in 2 or 3.  
Option 1: R in 2, E in 4 → S R _ E _  
Need two new consonants for 3 and 5, not A, I, T, N. Good choices: D, L, C, etc.  
Word: S R O E D → not valid.  
Word: S R I E D → I is out.  
Word: S R O E K → not common.  

Option 2: R in 3, E in 2 → S _ R E _  
Need letters for 2 and 5. 2 can be any unused consonant, 5 can be another.  
Word: S C R E D → valid and uses new letters C and D.  

Check constraints:  
- S in 1 ✓  
- C new  
- R in 3 (allowed)  
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- D new  
No forbidden letters (A, I, T, N).

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions to test.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so R is not in position 1)
- A, I are NOT in the word
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is not in position 4)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is not in position 5)

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: R, S, E
- Letters NOT in the word: A, I
- Positions to avoid for these letters:
  - R cannot be in position 1
  - S cannot be in position 4
  - E cannot be in position 5

I need a new 5-letter word that contains R, S, E (each at least once) and does not contain A or I. Also, I need to place R, S, E in different positions than the ones tried before.

Let me think of a word that fits these constraints. ""STORE"" comes to mind:
- Contains S, T, O, R, E
- Does not contain A or I
- R is in position 4 (was in position 1 before, so new position)
- S is in position 1 (was in position 4 before, so new position)
- E is in position 5 (but this is the same position as before, which was marked wrong, so this is bad)

""TRIES"" might work:
- T, R, I, E, S
- But I is not allowed (was marked x in feedback)

""STARE"" has A, which is not allowed.

""SERVE"":
- S, E, R, V, E
- Contains E twice, but that's okay
- R in position 3 (new)
- S in position 1 (new)
- E in position 2 and 5 (but E cannot be in position 5, so this is bad)

""REACT"" has A, which is not allowed.

""CRSER"" is not a valid word.

""TRIES"" has I, which is not allowed.

""EXTRA"" has A, which is not allowed.

""ERST"" is 4 letters.

""STERN"":
- S, T, E, R, N
- Contains S, E, R
- Does not contain A or I
- Positions:
  - S in position 1 (was in position 4 before, so new)
  - E in position 3 (was in position 5 before, so new)
  - R in position 4 (was in position 1 before, so new)
- T and N are new letters to test

This seems like a good choice.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: STERN -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) T(x) E(-) R(-) N(x)
<|im_end|>

From the combined feedback:

Letters we know are in the word: S (fixed in position 1), R, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, I, T, N  

Positions still unknown for R and E:  
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 4  
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5  

The word so far looks like:  
S _ _ _ _  

We need to place R and E plus two more distinct letters (cannot be A, I, T, N).  
Good remaining consonants: D, L, C, H, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A and I are out, and E is already in).

Let’s try to keep R and E in new positions and test two fresh consonants.  
A promising pattern is S _ E _ _ or S _ _ E _ , but E can’t be in 5.  
Let’s try S _ _ E _ , but E in 4 is allowed.  

Word that fits:  
S C O R E  
- S in 1 (✓)  
- C, O new letters  
- R in 4 (was in 1 and 4 in earlier guesses, but feedback for 4 was “-” so 4 is wrong for R; thus R must be in 2 or 3)  
Wait, R cannot be in 4 (from STERN feedback R(-) in 4), and cannot be in 1 (from RAISE feedback R(-) in 1). So R must be in 2 or 3.  

Let’s try R in 2: S R _ _ _  
Then place E somewhere E can go (not 3 or 5). Possible positions: 3 is out for E (feedback from RAISE: E(-) in 5, but 3 wasn’t tested yet). Wait, E was only marked wrong in 5 (from RAISE) and in 3 (from STERN). So E can be in 2 or 4.  

But R needs to be in 2 or 3.  
Option 1: R in 2, E in 4 → S R _ E _  
Need two new consonants for 3 and 5, not A, I, T, N. Good choices: D, L, C, etc.  
Word: S R O E D → not valid.  
Word: S R I E D → I is out.  
Word: S R O E K → not common.  

Option 2: R in 3, E in 2 → S _ R E _  
Need letters for 2 and 5. 2 can be any unused consonant, 5 can be another.  
Word: S C R E D → valid and uses new letters C and D.  

Check constraints:  
- S in 1 ✓  
- C new  
- R in 3 (allowed)  
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- D new  
No forbidden letters (A, I, T, N).  

This seems optimal.

From the feedback so far:

Letters we know are in the word but whose positions are not yet fixed:
- R (cannot be in positions 1, 4, 5)
- E (cannot be in positions 3, 5)

So R must be in position 2 or 3, and E must be in position 2 or 4.

We need a 5-letter word that starts with S, contains R and E exactly once each, does not contain any of A, I, T, N, C, O, and places R and E in allowed positions.

- SRLEM (not a word)
- S RUED (not a word)
- S L E D (but E is in 4, not 2)

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Let me think of other valid words.

- Contains E and R
- But E is in 2 and 4, which would violate the feedback (E cannot be in 5, but 2 is allowed)
But ""SHEER"" has E in 2 and 4, which would mean E is in 2 (allowed) and 4 (allowed). But the word must have exactly one R and one E, so this might be valid.

But ""SHEER"" has E in 2 and 4, which would be two E's. The word can have repeated letters, but we have no information about duplicates. However, the feedback only indicated one E in the word.

Alternatively, let's try ""SHRED"":

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently used consonants and vowels. The word ""RAISE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains:
- R (very common consonant)
- A (common vowel)
- I (common vowel)
- S (very common consonant)
- E (most common vowel)

This combination gives me good coverage of common letters and positions to test.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(-) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R is in the word but in the wrong position (so R is not in position 1)
- A, I are NOT in the word
- S is in the word but in the wrong position (so S is not in position 4)
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (so E is not in position 5)

So far we know:
- Letters in the word: R, S, E
- Letters NOT in the word: A, I
- Positions to avoid for these letters:
  - R cannot be in position 1
  - S cannot be in position 4
  - E cannot be in position 5

I need a new 5-letter word that contains R, S, E (each at least once) and does not contain A or I. Also, I need to place R, S, E in different positions than the ones tried before.

Let me think of a word that fits these constraints. ""STORE"" comes to mind:
- Contains S, T, O, R, E
- Does not contain A or I
- R is in position 4 (was in position 1 before, so new position)
- S is in position 1 (was in position 4 before, so new position)
- E is in position 5 (but this is the same position as before, which was marked wrong, so this is bad)

""TRIES"" might work:
- T, R, I, E, S
- But I is not allowed (was marked x in feedback)

""STARE"" has A, which is not allowed.

""SERVE"":
- S, E, R, V, E
- Contains E twice, but that's okay
- R in position 3 (new)
- S in position 1 (new)
- E in position 2 and 5 (but E cannot be in position 5, so this is bad)

""REACT"" has A, which is not allowed.

""CRSER"" is not a valid word.

""TRIES"" has I, which is not allowed.

""EXTRA"" has A, which is not allowed.

""ERST"" is 4 letters.

""STERN"":
- S, T, E, R, N
- Contains S, E, R
- Does not contain A or I
- Positions:
  - S in position 1 (was in position 4 before, so new)
  - E in position 3 (was in position 5 before, so new)
  - R in position 4 (was in position 1 before, so new)
- T and N are new letters to test

This seems like a good choice.

From the combined feedback:

Letters we know are in the word: S (fixed in position 1), R, E  
Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, I, T, N  

Positions still unknown for R and E:  
- R cannot be in positions 1 or 4  
- E cannot be in positions 3 or 5  

The word so far looks like:  
S _ _ _ _  

We need to place R and E plus two more distinct letters (cannot be A, I, T, N).  
Good remaining consonants: D, L, C, H, M, P, etc.  
Good remaining vowels: O, U (since A and I are out, and E is already in).

Let’s try to keep R and E in new positions and test two fresh consonants.  
A promising pattern is S _ E _ _ or S _ _ E _ , but E can’t be in 5.  
Let’s try S _ _ E _ , but E in 4 is allowed.  

Word that fits:  
S C O R E  
- S in 1 (✓)  
- C, O new letters  
- R in 4 (was in 1 and 4 in earlier guesses, but feedback for 4 was “-” so 4 is wrong for R; thus R must be in 2 or 3)  
Wait, R cannot be in 4 (from STERN feedback R(-) in 4), and cannot be in 1 (from RAISE feedback R(-) in 1). So R must be in 2 or 3.  

Let’s try R in 2: S R _ _ _  
Then place E somewhere E can go (not 3 or 5). Possible positions: 3 is out for E (feedback from RAISE: E(-) in 5, but 3 wasn’t tested yet). Wait, E was only marked wrong in 5 (from RAISE) and in 3 (from STERN). So E can be in 2 or 4.  

But R needs to be in 2 or 3.  
Option 1: R in 2, E in 4 → S R _ E _  
Need two new consonants for 3 and 5, not A, I, T, N. Good choices: D, L, C, etc.  
Word: S R O E D → not valid.  
Word: S R I E D → I is out.  
Word: S R O E K → not common.  

Option 2: R in 3, E in 2 → S _ R E _  
Need letters for 2 and 5. 2 can be any unused consonant, 5 can be another.  
Word: S C R E D → valid and uses new letters C and D.  

Check constraints:  
- S in 1 ✓  
- C new  
- R in 3 (allowed)  
- E in 2 (allowed)  
- D new  
No forbidden letters (A, I, T, N).  

This seems optimal.

From the latest feedback on SHRED:
- S(✓) – S is correctly placed in position 1.
- H(x) – H is not in the word at all.
- R(✓) – R is correctly placed in position 3.
- E(-) – E is in the word but NOT in position 4.
- D(x) – D is not in the word at all.

So far we know the word looks like:
S _ R _ _

Letters we know are NOT in the word: A, I, T, N, C, O, H, D.

Letters we know are in the word and where they sit:
- S in position 1 (fixed)
- R in position 3 (fixed)
- E somewhere, but not position 4 or 5 (from feedback: cannot be in 5 from RAISE, and cannot be in 4 from SHRED). So E must be in position 2.

Thus the word must be:
S E R _ _

We need one more letter for position 5. Available letters (not already ruled out and not used yet): B, F, G, K, L, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Looking for valid 5-letter English words that fit SER _ _:

- SERUM (but U is in position 4, which would be wrong because E must be in 2)
- SERFS
- SERGE
- SEREN (not a word)
- SERUM (already considered)
- SERVS

Valid options: SERFS, SERGE, SERVS.

Among these, ""SERGE"" is a valid English word (a type of fabric) and uses G, which hasn't been ruled out.

So the next logical guess is SERGE.
