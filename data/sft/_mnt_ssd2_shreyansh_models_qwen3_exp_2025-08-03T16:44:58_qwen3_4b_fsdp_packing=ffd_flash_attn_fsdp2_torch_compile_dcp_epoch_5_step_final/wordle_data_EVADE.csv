For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of vowels and common consonants.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides excellent coverage of common letters.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- E is in the correct final position.  
- A is in the word but not in the first position.  
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E, contains A somewhere (but not at the start), and does not contain R, O, S.

Letters still possible: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
- keeps the known E at the end,  
- uses the known A in a different spot,  
- introduces several fresh common consonants,  
- avoids R, O, S.

A good candidate is “TALKE”:
- T and K are common consonants we haven’t tested.  
- L is another common untested consonant.  
- A moves from position 1 to position 2.  
- E stays fixed at position 5.

This gives us four new letters (T, A, L, K, E) with A and E already partially known, and positions for A and E updated.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with distinct common letters. ""AROSE"" is often recommended as a strong starting word because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and no duplicates. This gives us good coverage to identify which letters are in the secret word.

Another good option could be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of vowels and common consonants.

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it provides excellent coverage of common letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- E is in the correct final position.  
- A is in the word but not in the first position.  
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E, contains A somewhere (but not at the start), and does not contain R, O, S.

Letters still possible: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
- keeps the known E at the end,  
- uses the known A in a different spot,  
- introduces several fresh common consonants,  
- avoids R, O, S.

A good candidate is “TALKE”:
- T and K are common consonants we haven’t tested.  
- L is another common untested consonant.  
- A moves from position 1 to position 2.  
- E stays fixed at position 5.

This gives us four new letters (T, A, L, K, E) with A and E already partially known, and positions for A and E updated.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. E is definitely in the 5th position (✓ both times).
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (- both times).
3. Letters that are OUT: R, O, S, T, L, K.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ E  
and it must contain A somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and it cannot contain R, O, S, T, L, K.

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
- Ends in E  
- Has A in position 3 or 4  
- Uses only the allowed letters

Good candidates:
- If A is in position 3: _ _ A _ E → e.g., CABLE (but L is out), so CABE? (invalid)  
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A E → e.g., HUMAE (but U and M are allowed), or PINEA (but P, I, N, A, E – P, I, N, A, E are all allowed).

Let’s pick “HUMAE” because it introduces H, U, M, A, E.  
- H, U, M are new and common.  
- A is in position 4 (allowed).  
- E is fixed at position 5.

This should tell us about three new consonants (H, U, M) and confirm A’s position.

Current knowledge:
- E is locked in position 5 (✓ every time).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 3 (has been “-” in all four spots so far).  
  → A has only one possible position left: position 2.
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, T, L, K, H, U, M, B, I.
- Remaining unused common letters: C, D, F, G, N, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

So the word must look like: _ A _ _ E  
and the only untested consonants we need for positions 1, 3, 4 are from C, D, F, G, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.

We also know D appeared in guess 4 and was marked “-” (in the word but wrong spot).  
Since D is “-” in position 3, it must appear somewhere else: either position 1 or 4.

Let’s try placing D in position 1 and pick two other unused consonants for positions 3 and 4.  
A good candidate is “DANCE”:
- D in position 1 (new).  
- A in position 2 (must be).  
- N, C, E in positions 3, 4, 5 (all letters are still possible).  
This tests D, N, C and confirms placement.

But wait: D was marked “-” in position 3 (guess 4), so D cannot be in position 3.  
However, in “DANCE” D is in position 1, which is new for D.  
N and C have never been tested.  
This seems valid.

Another quick check: no other letter conflicts.  
So “DANCE” is a strong next guess.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- E is in the correct final position.  
- A is in the word but not in the first position.  
- R, O, S are not in the word at all.

So the secret word ends in E, contains A somewhere (but not at the start), and does not contain R, O, S.

Letters still possible: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word that:
- keeps the known E at the end,  
- uses the known A in a different spot,  
- introduces several fresh common consonants,  
- avoids R, O, S.

A good candidate is “TALKE”:
- T and K are common consonants we haven’t tested.  
- L is another common untested consonant.  
- A moves from position 1 to position 2.  
- E stays fixed at position 5.

1. E is definitely in the 5th position (✓ both times).
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (- both times).
3. Letters that are OUT: R, O, S, T, L, K.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ _ _ E  
and it must contain A somewhere in positions 3 or 4, and it cannot contain R, O, S, T, L, K.

Remaining unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word that:
- Ends in E  
- Has A in position 3 or 4  
- Uses only the allowed letters

Good candidates:
- If A is in position 3: _ _ A _ E → e.g., CABLE (but L is out), so CABE? (invalid)  
- If A is in position 4: _ _ _ A E → e.g., HUMAE (but U and M are allowed), or PINEA (but P, I, N, A, E – P, I, N, A, E are all allowed).

Let’s pick “HUMAE” because it introduces H, U, M, A, E.  
- H, U, M are new and common.  
- A is in position 4 (allowed).  
- E is fixed at position 5.

This should tell us about three new consonants (H, U, M) and confirm A’s position.

So far we know:
- E is fixed in position 5 (✓ in every guess).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 4 (- in every guess it has appeared in those spots).
- Letters definitely excluded: R, O, S, T, L, K, H, U, M.

Therefore:
- A must be in position 3.
- The word has the form: _ _ A _ E
- Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): B, C, D, F, G, I, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need two new consonants (positions 1 and 2) and one vowel (position 4) that haven’t been tested yet.  
Common vowels still available: I, E (but E is already used), so I is the only untested vowel.

Common consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, N, P, V, W, etc.

Let’s pick a word that:
- Places A in position 3 and E in position 5.
- Uses two new consonants in positions 1 and 2.
- Uses the only remaining common vowel I in position 4.

A good candidate is “BIDAE”:
- B and D are new consonants.
- I is the new vowel.
- A is in position 3, E in 5.

This will test B, I, D, A, E and confirm A in position 3.

Current knowledge:
- E is locked in position 5 (✓ every time).
- A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 4, or 3 (has been “-” in all four spots so far).  
  → A has only one possible position left: position 2.
- Letters already ruled out: R, O, S, T, L, K, H, U, M, B, I.
- Remaining unused common letters: C, D, F, G, N, P, Q, V, W, Y, Z.

So the word must look like: _ A _ _ E  
and the only untested consonants we need for positions 1, 3, 4 are from C, D, F, G, N, P, V, W, Y, Z.

We also know D appeared in guess 4 and was marked “-” (in the word but wrong spot).  
Since D is “-” in position 3, it must appear somewhere else: either position 1 or 4.

Let’s try placing D in position 1 and pick two other unused consonants for positions 3 and 4.  
A good candidate is “DANCE”:
- D in position 1 (new).  
- A in position 2 (must be).  
- N, C, E in positions 3, 4, 5 (all letters are still possible).  
This tests D, N, C and confirms placement.

But wait: D was marked “-” in position 3 (guess 4), so D cannot be in position 3.  
However, in “DANCE” D is in position 1, which is new for D.  
N and C have never been tested.  
This seems valid.

Another quick check: no other letter conflicts.  
So “DANCE” is a strong next guess.

Let's update what we now know after the fifth guess:

1. E is definitely in position 5 (✓ every time).
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (has been “-” in all four spots).  
   → A has no possible positions left! This is impossible, so the only explanation is that our previous interpretation was wrong.  
   Re-examining the feedback:  
   - Guess 4: bidae → B(x) I(x) D(-) A(-) E(✓)  
     Here, A is in position 4 and marked “-”, meaning A is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - Guess 5: dance → D(-) A(-) N(x) C(x) E(✓)  
     Here, A is in position 2 and marked “-”, meaning A is in the word but not in position 2.

   So A is NOT in positions 2 or 4, but it has appeared in both positions 2 and 4 and was always marked “-”.  
   The only way this can happen is if the feedback symbol applies to the letter’s position in that specific guess, not globally.  
   Therefore, A is allowed in positions 2 and 4, just not confirmed yet.  
   (This was a misinterpretation earlier; the “-” only rules out the letter in that exact position for that guess.)

3. Letters definitely excluded so far: R, O, S, T, L, K, H, U, M, B, I, N, C.  
   Remaining unused common letters: D, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. From guess 4: D is in the word but not in position 3.  
   From guess 5: D is in position 1 and marked “-”, so D is not in position 1.

   Therefore, D must be in position 4.

5. So far the word pattern is: _ _ _ D E  
   and it must contain A somewhere (positions 2 or 3, since 1, 4, 5 are ruled out).  
   But position 4 is now fixed as D, and position 5 as E, so A must be in position 2 or 3.

6. Let’s consider both cases:
   - Case 1: A in position 2 → _ A _ D E  
     Remaining letters for positions 1 and 3 must be from the unused pool (F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
     Common consonants: F, G, V, P.

     Possible words:  
     - F A V D E → “favde” – not a valid word.  
     - G A V D E → “gavde” – invalid.  
     - P A V D E → “pavde” – invalid.  
     - F A J D E → “fajde” – invalid.  
     - G A J D E → “gajde” – invalid.

   - Case 2: A in position 3 → _ _ A D E  
     Remaining letters for positions 1 and 2 must be from the unused pool.  
     Possible combinations:  
     - F J A D E → “fjade” – invalid.  
     - G J A D E → “gjade” – invalid.  
     - V J A D E → “vjade” – invalid.  
     - P J A D E → “pjade” – invalid.  
     - F G A D E → “fgade” – invalid.  
     - V G A D E → “vgade” – invalid.  
     - P G A D E → “pgade” – invalid.

   None of the above combinations form valid English words.  
   This suggests we need to try a word that places A in position 2 and D in position 4, with valid consonants.

   Let’s try:  
   - F A R D E – but R is excluded.  
   - P A R D E – R excluded.  
   - G A R D E – R excluded.  
   - V A R D E – R excluded.  
   - F A V D E – already considered.

   Another approach: perhaps D is not in position 4.  
   Re-examining the feedback:  
   - Guess 4: bidae → D(-) means D is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - Guess 5: dance → D(-) means D is in the word but not in position 1.

   So D could be in position 2 or 3 or 4, but not 1.  
   But position 4 is where D appeared in guess 4 and was marked “-”, so D cannot be in position 4.  
   Similarly, D cannot be in position 1.  
   So D must be in position 2 or 3.

   Let’s re-evaluate with D in position 2 or 3.

   Possible patterns:  
   - _ D A _ E (D in 2, A in 3)  
   - _ A D _ E (A in 2, D in 3) – but D cannot be in 3 because in guess 4 D was in 3 and marked “-”.

   So only possible pattern is: _ D A _ E  
   With D in position 2 and A in position 3.

   Then positions 1 and 4 must be filled with unused letters (F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
   Valid English words fitting _ D A _ E:  
   - F D A A E – invalid.  
   - G D A A E – invalid.  
   - V D A A E – invalid.  
   - P D A A E – invalid.  
   - F D A V E – “fadev” – invalid.  
   - G D A V E – “gadve” – invalid.  
   - V D A V E – invalid.  
   - P D A V E – invalid.

   Another valid word: “grade” – but R is excluded.  
   “grade” has G, R, A, D, E – R is excluded.

   “gavel” – L is excluded.  
   “paved” – V, E, D – but A is in 3, D in 4, E in 5.  
   “paved” is P, A, V, E, D – positions: P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5).  
   But we know E must be in 5, so this doesn’t fit.

   Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting _ D A _ E with letters from F, G, J, P, V, W, Y, Z:

   - “fadge” – but G and E must be in specific positions.  
   - “gadge” – invalid.  
   - “vadge” – invalid.  
   - “padge” – invalid.

   Actually, the only valid word I can find is “gavel”, but L is excluded.  
   Another possibility: “wadey” – but Y is sometimes considered vowel, but word may not fit.

   Let me try:  
   - F A D E – too short.  
   - P A D E – too short.  
   - G A D E – too short.

   Realizing that with current constraints, a valid word is “gavel” (but L excluded).  
   Next possible is “faded” – but D is already used.

   Actually, the word “gaped” – but P is allowed, A in 2, D in 3, E in 5, but pattern is _ _ A D E.

   Let me try:  
   - G A P D E – “gaped” – but A is in 2, D in 4, E in 5.  
   - G A P D E – letters: G, A, P, D, E – all allowed (G, P from unused, A, D, E known).  
   - Check if G, A, P, D, E form a valid word: yes, “gaped”.

   So the correct guess is “gaped”.
</think>

Based on the latest feedback, the word must end in “DE” (positions 4 and 5), contain A (which has only two possible positions left: 2 or 3), and use only the letters not yet excluded. The only valid 5-letter word fitting these constraints is:

<guess>gaped</guess>",gaped,"Let's update what we now know after the fifth guess:

1. E is definitely in position 5 (✓ every time).
2. A is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (has been “-” in all four spots).  
   → A has no possible positions left! This is impossible, so the only explanation is that our previous interpretation was wrong.  
   Re-examining the feedback:  
   - Guess 4: bidae → B(x) I(x) D(-) A(-) E(✓)  
     Here, A is in position 4 and marked “-”, meaning A is in the word but not in position 4.  
   - Guess 5: dance → D(-) A(-) N(x) C(x) E(✓)  
     Here, A is in position 2 and marked “-”, meaning A is in the word but not in position 2.

   So A is NOT in positions 2 or 4, but it has appeared in both positions 2 and 4 and was always marked “-”.  
   The only way this can happen is if the feedback symbol applies to the letter’s position in that specific guess, not globally.  
   Therefore, A is allowed in positions 2 and 4, just not confirmed yet.  
   (This was a misinterpretation earlier; the “-” only rules out the letter in that exact position for that guess.)

3. Letters definitely excluded so far: R, O, S, T, L, K, H, U, M, B, I, N, C.  
   Remaining unused common letters: D, F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

4. From guess 4: D is in the word but not in position 3.  
   From guess 5: D is in position 1 and marked “-”, so D is not in position 1.

   Therefore, D must be in position 4.

5. So far the word pattern is: _ _ _ D E  
   and it must contain A somewhere (positions 2 or 3, since 1, 4, 5 are ruled out).  
   But position 4 is now fixed as D, and position 5 as E, so A must be in position 2 or 3.

6. Let’s consider both cases:
   - Case 1: A in position 2 → _ A _ D E  
     Remaining letters for positions 1 and 3 must be from the unused pool (F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
     Common consonants: F, G, V, P.

     Possible words:  
     - F A V D E → “favde” – not a valid word.  
     - G A V D E → “gavde” – invalid.  
     - P A V D E → “pavde” – invalid.  
     - F A J D E → “fajde” – invalid.  
     - G A J D E → “gajde” – invalid.

   - Case 2: A in position 3 → _ _ A D E  
     Remaining letters for positions 1 and 2 must be from the unused pool.  
     Possible combinations:  
     - F J A D E → “fjade” – invalid.  
     - G J A D E → “gjade” – invalid.  
     - V J A D E → “vjade” – invalid.  
     - P J A D E → “pjade” – invalid.  
     - F G A D E → “fgade” – invalid.  
     - V G A D E → “vgade” – invalid.  
     - P G A D E → “pgade” – invalid.

   None of the above combinations form valid English words.  
   This suggests we need to try a word that places A in position 2 and D in position 4, with valid consonants.

   Let’s try:  
   - F A R D E – but R is excluded.  
   - P A R D E – R excluded.  
   - G A R D E – R excluded.  
   - V A R D E – R excluded.  
   - F A V D E – already considered.

   Another approach: perhaps D is not in position 4.  
   Re-examining the feedback:  
   - Guess 4: bidae → D(-) means D is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - Guess 5: dance → D(-) means D is in the word but not in position 1.

   So D could be in position 2 or 3 or 4, but not 1.  
   But position 4 is where D appeared in guess 4 and was marked “-”, so D cannot be in position 4.  
   Similarly, D cannot be in position 1.  
   So D must be in position 2 or 3.

   Let’s re-evaluate with D in position 2 or 3.

   Possible patterns:  
   - _ D A _ E (D in 2, A in 3)  
   - _ A D _ E (A in 2, D in 3) – but D cannot be in 3 because in guess 4 D was in 3 and marked “-”.

   So only possible pattern is: _ D A _ E  
   With D in position 2 and A in position 3.

   Then positions 1 and 4 must be filled with unused letters (F, G, J, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z).  
   Valid English words fitting _ D A _ E:  
   - F D A A E – invalid.  
   - G D A A E – invalid.  
   - V D A A E – invalid.  
   - P D A A E – invalid.  
   - F D A V E – “fadev” – invalid.  
   - G D A V E – “gadve” – invalid.  
   - V D A V E – invalid.  
   - P D A V E – invalid.

   Another valid word: “grade” – but R is excluded.  
   “grade” has G, R, A, D, E – R is excluded.

   “gavel” – L is excluded.  
   “paved” – V, E, D – but A is in 3, D in 4, E in 5.  
   “paved” is P, A, V, E, D – positions: P(1), A(2), V(3), E(4), D(5).  
   But we know E must be in 5, so this doesn’t fit.

   Wait, let’s list valid 5-letter words fitting _ D A _ E with letters from F, G, J, P, V, W, Y, Z:

   - “fadge” – but G and E must be in specific positions.  
   - “gadge” – invalid.  
   - “vadge” – invalid.  
   - “padge” – invalid.

   Actually, the only valid word I can find is “gavel”, but L is excluded.  
   Another possibility: “wadey” – but Y is sometimes considered vowel, but word may not fit.

   Let me try:  
   - F A D E – too short.  
   - P A D E – too short.  
   - G A D E – too short.

   Realizing that with current constraints, a valid word is “gavel” (but L excluded).  
   Next possible is “faded” – but D is already used.

   Actually, the word “gaped” – but P is allowed, A in 2, D in 3, E in 5, but pattern is _ _ A D E.

   Let me try:  
   - G A P D E – “gaped” – but A is in 2, D in 4, E in 5.  
   - G A P D E – letters: G, A, P, D, E – all allowed (G, P from unused, A, D, E known).  
   - Check if G, A, P, D, E form a valid word: yes, “gaped”.

   So the correct guess is “gaped”.Based on the latest feedback, the word must end in “DE” (positions 4 and 5), contain A (which has only two possible positions left: 2 or 3), and use only the letters not yet excluded. The only valid 5-letter word fitting these constraints is:",Guess 6: gaped -> FEEDBACK: G(x) A(-) P(x) E(-) D(-),FAIL
