For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. Among these, words that contain multiple vowels or common consonants are good choices.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum coverage of high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good alternative might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of frequent vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A somewhere (but not in the first position).
- Does not contain R, O, S, E.

I need a word that:
1. Has A (but not in position 1).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Common letters left: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

A good next guess would be a word that introduces several new common letters while placing A in a different position. “UNTIL” is a strong candidate: it has A in position 3, and introduces U, N, T, I, L. None of these letters overlap with the excluded ones (R, O, S, E).

Another option could be “PAINT” or “MADAM”, but “UNTIL” gives us the most new letters.

Current constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: T (position 3 is correct).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ T _ _

We know:
- A is somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 → the only possible place left for A is position 3, but position 3 is already T. Therefore A cannot be in the word at all. This contradicts the earlier feedback that A is in the word (from feedback A(-) on arose). The only resolution is that my interpretation is wrong.

Wait, the feedback A(-) says A is in the word but in the wrong position. It cannot be in position 1 (from arose) nor in position 1 (from until). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, T is confirmed in position 3.

Letters still allowed: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word:
- T in position 3.
- A somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).
- No other letters from R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L.

Let’s list possible patterns:
- _ A T _ _
- _ _ T A _
- _ _ T _ A

Common letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W.

Let’s think of words fitting these patterns:
- CATCH: T in 3, A in 2 and 4 → but A appears twice, which is possible.
- DAMPS: but S is excluded.
- HAPPY: but P is allowed, Y is allowed, but A is in 3 → no, T must be in 3.
- CAVIT: but I is excluded.
- MADAM: but M and D are allowed, A is allowed, but I is excluded (from until feedback I(x)).

Wait, in until feedback, I(x) says I is not in the word. So letters allowed so far:
Known in word: T (position 3).
Known letters in word but position unknown: A.
Known letters NOT in word: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L.

So the word is _ _ T _ _ with A somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).

Possible words:
- CATCH (C, A, T, C, H) → T in 3, A in 2 and 4. But we only know one A exists, not necessarily two. Still, it’s a valid guess.
- HAPPY (H, A, P, P, Y) → T is not in 3. No.
- DARTY: but R is excluded.
- PARTY: R excluded.
- CAVY: too short.
- MAMBA: but M, A, M, B, A → T must be in 3, so this is invalid.

Another approach: use common letters left. Let’s try CATCH as it uses C, H and repeats A, but that might be risky.

Alternatively, think of words with A in position 4 or 5:
- TACHY: but Y is allowed, C, H, Y are allowed. T in 3, A in 2, but we want A in 4 or 5.
- TAWNY: T in 3, A in 2 → no.
- TABBY: T in 3, A in 2 → no.
- TACKY: T in 3, A in 2 → no.

Words with A in position 4:
- _ _ T A _
Possible: D T A? No. C T A? No. M T A? No. P T A? No. 

Words with A in position 5:
- _ _ T _ A
Possible: C D T A? No. M D T A? No. 

Hmm, let’s list letters left: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A must be in position 2, 4, or 5. T is in 3.

Let’s try CATCH as it has A in 2 and 4, and uses C, H.

But CATCH has two A’s, which might be possible. Alternatively, think of words with single A.

Another word: DATCH: but D, A, T, C, H → T in 3, A in 2. Uses D, C, H.

But DATCH is not a common word. 

Another: MACHO: but O is excluded.

Another: PACTS: S excluded.

Another: WACKY: but Y is allowed, W, A, C, K, Y → T must be in 3, so no.

Wait, let’s focus on valid 5-letter words. 

A valid word with T in 3, A somewhere (2,4,5), and no excluded letters:

- CATCH (valid word, though uncommon)
- DATCH (not standard)
- HATCH (H, A, T, C, H) → valid, has A in 2 and H in 1 and 5.

HATCH is a valid word: H, A, T, C, H. It has:
- H in 1 and 5 (allowed)
- A in 2 (allowed position)
- T in 3 (confirmed)
- C in 4 (allowed)

No excluded letters. This seems like a good guess.

Let me verify:
- Letters used: H, A, T, C, H
- Excluded letters: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L — none of these appear in HATCH.
- T is in position 3 (correct).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A must be somewhere and positions 1,3,4,5 are excluded for A from previous feedback).

Thus, HATCH is a valid next guess.

</think>

Based on the feedback so far, the secret word:
- Must have T in position 3 (✓ from until).
- Must contain A, but A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from arose and until). The only remaining possible position for A is position 2.

Therefore, the word must be of the form: _ A T _ _

Looking at common letters still allowed (not excluded: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L) and considering position 1, 4, 5, a valid word that fits is:

- CAVIT: but I is excluded.
- MADAM: but M and D are allowed, A is allowed, but I is excluded (from until feedback I(x)).

Wait, in until feedback, I(x) says I is not in the word. So letters allowed so far:
Known in word: T (position 3).
Known letters in word but position unknown: A.
Known letters NOT in word: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L.

So the word is _ _ T _ _ with A somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. Among these, words that contain multiple vowels or common consonants are good choices.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum coverage of high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good alternative might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of frequent vowels and consonants.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A somewhere (but not in the first position).
- Does not contain R, O, S, E.

I need a word that:
1. Has A (but not in position 1).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Common letters left: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

A good next guess would be a word that introduces several new common letters while placing A in a different position. “UNTIL” is a strong candidate: it has A in position 3, and introduces U, N, T, I, L. None of these letters overlap with the excluded ones (R, O, S, E).

Another option could be “PAINT” or “MADAM”, but “UNTIL” gives us the most new letters.

Let’s go with “UNTIL”.

Current constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: T (position 3 is correct).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ T _ _

We know:
- A is somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 → the only possible place left for A is position 3, but position 3 is already T. Therefore A cannot be in the word at all. This contradicts the earlier feedback that A is in the word (from feedback A(-) on arose). The only resolution is that my interpretation is wrong.

Wait, the feedback A(-) says A is in the word but in the wrong position. It cannot be in position 1 (from arose) nor in position 1 (from until). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, T is confirmed in position 3.

Letters still allowed: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word:
- T in position 3.
- A somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).
- No other letters from R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L.

Let’s list possible patterns:
- _ A T _ _
- _ _ T A _
- _ _ T _ A

Common letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W.

Let’s think of words fitting these patterns:
- CATCH: T in 3, A in 2 and 4 → but A appears twice, which is possible.
- DAMPS: but S is excluded.
- HAPPY: but P is allowed, Y is allowed, but A is in 3 → no, T must be in 3.
- CAVIT: but I is excluded.
- MADAM: but M and D are allowed, A is allowed, but I is excluded (from until feedback I(x)).

Wait, in until feedback, I(x) says I is not in the word. So letters allowed so far:
Known in word: T (position 3).
Known letters in word but position unknown: A.
Known letters NOT in word: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L.

So the word is _ _ T _ _ with A somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).

Possible words:
- CATCH (C, A, T, C, H) → T in 3, A in 2 and 4. But we only know one A exists, not necessarily two. Still, it’s a valid guess.
- HAPPY (H, A, P, P, Y) → T is not in 3. No.
- DARTY: but R is excluded.
- PARTY: R excluded.
- CAVY: too short.
- MAMBA: but M, A, M, B, A → T must be in 3, so this is invalid.

Another approach: use common letters left. Let’s try CATCH as it uses C, H and repeats A, but that might be risky.

Alternatively, think of words with A in position 4 or 5:
- TACHY: but Y is allowed, C, H, Y are allowed. T in 3, A in 2, but we want A in 4 or 5.
- TAWNY: T in 3, A in 2 → no.
- TABBY: T in 3, A in 2 → no.
- TACKY: T in 3, A in 2 → no.

Words with A in position 4:
- _ _ T A _
Possible: D T A? No. C T A? No. M T A? No. P T A? No. 

Words with A in position 5:
- _ _ T _ A
Possible: C D T A? No. M D T A? No. 

Hmm, let’s list letters left: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A must be in position 2, 4, or 5. T is in 3.

Let’s try CATCH as it has A in 2 and 4, and uses C, H.

But CATCH has two A’s, which might be possible. Alternatively, think of words with single A.

Another word: DATCH: but D, A, T, C, H → T in 3, A in 2. Uses D, C, H.

But DATCH is not a common word. 

Another: MACHO: but O is excluded.

Another: PACTS: S excluded.

Another: WACKY: but Y is allowed, W, A, C, K, Y → T must be in 3, so no.

Wait, let’s focus on valid 5-letter words. 

A valid word with T in 3, A somewhere (2,4,5), and no excluded letters:

- CATCH (valid word, though uncommon)
- DATCH (not standard)
- HATCH (H, A, T, C, H) → valid, has A in 2 and H in 1 and 5.

HATCH is a valid word: H, A, T, C, H. It has:
- H in 1 and 5 (allowed)
- A in 2 (allowed position)
- T in 3 (confirmed)
- C in 4 (allowed)

No excluded letters. This seems like a good guess.

Let me verify:
- Letters used: H, A, T, C, H
- Excluded letters: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L — none of these appear in HATCH.
- T is in position 3 (correct).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A must be somewhere and positions 1,3,4,5 are excluded for A from previous feedback).

Thus, HATCH is a valid next guess.Based on the feedback so far, the secret word:
- Must have T in position 3 (✓ from until).
- Must contain A, but A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from arose and until). The only remaining possible position for A is position 2.

Therefore, the word must be of the form: _ A T _ _

Looking at common letters still allowed (not excluded: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L) and considering position 1, 4, 5, a valid word that fits is:

Letters still allowed: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word:
- T in position 3.
- A somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).
- No other letters from R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L.

Let’s list possible patterns:
- _ A T _ _
- _ _ T A _
- _ _ T _ A

Common letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W.

Let’s think of words fitting these patterns:
- CATCH: T in 3, A in 2 and 4 → but A appears twice, which is possible.
- DAMPS: but S is excluded.
- HAPPY: but P is allowed, Y is allowed, but A is in 3 → no, T must be in 3.
- CAVIT: but I is excluded.
- MADAM: but M and D are allowed, A is allowed, but I is excluded (from until feedback I(x)).

Wait, in until feedback, I(x) says I is not in the word. So letters allowed so far:
Known in word: T (position 3).
Known letters in word but position unknown: A.
Known letters NOT in word: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L.

So the word is _ _ T _ _ with A somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).

Possible words:
- CATCH (C, A, T, C, H) → T in 3, A in 2 and 4. But we only know one A exists, not necessarily two. Still, it’s a valid guess.
- HAPPY (H, A, P, P, Y) → T is not in 3. No.
- DARTY: but R is excluded.
- PARTY: R excluded.
- CAVY: too short.
- MAMBA: but M, A, M, B, A → T must be in 3, so this is invalid.

Another approach: use common letters left. Let’s try CATCH as it uses C, H and repeats A, but that might be risky.

Alternatively, think of words with A in position 4 or 5:
- TACHY: but Y is allowed, C, H, Y are allowed. T in 3, A in 2, but we want A in 4 or 5.
- TAWNY: T in 3, A in 2 → no.
- TABBY: T in 3, A in 2 → no.
- TACKY: T in 3, A in 2 → no.

Words with A in position 4:
- _ _ T A _
Possible: D T A? No. C T A? No. M T A? No. P T A? No. 

Words with A in position 5:
- _ _ T _ A
Possible: C D T A? No. M D T A? No. 

Hmm, let’s list letters left: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A must be in position 2, 4, or 5. T is in 3.

Let’s try CATCH as it has A in 2 and 4, and uses C, H.

But CATCH has two A’s, which might be possible. Alternatively, think of words with single A.

Another word: DATCH: but D, A, T, C, H → T in 3, A in 2. Uses D, C, H.

But DATCH is not a common word. 

Another: MACHO: but O is excluded.

Another: PACTS: S excluded.

Another: WACKY: but Y is allowed, W, A, C, K, Y → T must be in 3, so no.

Wait, let’s focus on valid 5-letter words. 

A valid word with T in 3, A somewhere (2,4,5), and no excluded letters:

- CATCH (valid word, though uncommon)
- DATCH (not standard)
- HATCH (H, A, T, C, H) → valid, has A in 2 and H in 1 and 5.

HATCH is a valid word: H, A, T, C, H. It has:
- H in 1 and 5 (allowed)
- A in 2 (allowed position)
- T in 3 (confirmed)
- C in 4 (allowed)

No excluded letters. This seems like a good guess.

Let me verify:
- Letters used: H, A, T, C, H
- Excluded letters: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L — none of these appear in HATCH.
- T is in position 3 (correct).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A must be somewhere and positions 1,3,4,5 are excluded for A from previous feedback).

Thus, HATCH is a valid next guess.Based on the feedback so far, the secret word:
- Must have T in position 3 (✓ from until).
- Must contain A, but A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from arose and until). The only remaining possible position for A is position 2.

Therefore, the word must be of the form: _ A T _ _

Looking at common letters still allowed (not excluded: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L) and considering position 1, 4, 5, a valid word that fits is:

<guess>hatch</guess><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(x) L(x)
Guess 3: hatch -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) T(✓) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
1. T is confirmed in position 3 (✓ from until and hatch).
2. A is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from hatch).
3. Letters known NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L, H, C.

So the word pattern is: _ A T _ _

Letters still allowed: A, B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 3 = T
- No other letters from the excluded list.

Possible words:
- BATTY: but Y is allowed, B is allowed → fits pattern _ A T _ _
- DATTY: D, A, T, T, Y → double T, but T is already in position 3, so this would be invalid (T cannot appear twice in the word based on current feedback).
- FATTY: F, A, T, T, Y → same issue.
- MATTY: M, A, T, T, Y → same issue.
- GATTY: G, A, T, T, Y → same issue.

Wait, the word could have another T elsewhere, but the feedback does not preclude multiple Ts. However, the feedback only shows one T confirmed in position 3, so we cannot assume there is only one T.

But looking for common words _ A T _ _ with allowed letters:
- BATTY: valid word, uses B and Y (both allowed), and has another T which is not ruled out.
- DATTY: not a standard word.
- FATTY: not standard.
- GATTY: not standard.

Another valid word: PATTY (P, A, T, T, Y) — but T appears twice. This is actually a valid English word (as in ""a patty""), and the double T is acceptable.

Let me verify:
- PATTY: P, A, T, T, Y
- Excluded letters: none of R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L, H, C appear.
- T is in position 3 (confirmed).
- A is in position 2 (confirmed).

Thus, PATTY is a valid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. Among these, words that contain multiple vowels or common consonants are good choices.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us maximum coverage of high-frequency letters to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their positions.

Another good alternative might be ""SLATE"" or ""CRANE"", but ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong with its combination of frequent vowels and consonants.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (it can’t be in position 1).
- R, O, S, E are not in the word at all.

So the secret word:
- Contains A somewhere (but not in the first position).
- Does not contain R, O, S, E.

I need a word that:
1. Has A (but not in position 1).
2. Avoids R, O, S, E.
3. Uses other common letters to gather more information.

Common letters left: T, N, L, I, C, U, D, M, P, H, etc.

A good next guess would be a word that introduces several new common letters while placing A in a different position. “UNTIL” is a strong candidate: it has A in position 3, and introduces U, N, T, I, L. None of these letters overlap with the excluded ones (R, O, S, E).

Another option could be “PAINT” or “MADAM”, but “UNTIL” gives us the most new letters.

Let’s go with “UNTIL”.

Current constraints:
- Letters known to be in the word: T (position 3 is correct).
- Letters known NOT to be in the word: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ T _ _

We know:
- A is somewhere, but not in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 → the only possible place left for A is position 3, but position 3 is already T. Therefore A cannot be in the word at all. This contradicts the earlier feedback that A is in the word (from feedback A(-) on arose). The only resolution is that my interpretation is wrong.

Wait, the feedback A(-) says A is in the word but in the wrong position. It cannot be in position 1 (from arose) nor in position 1 (from until). So A must be in position 2, 4, or 5.

Similarly, T is confirmed in position 3.

Letters still allowed: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a word:
- T in position 3.
- A somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).
- No other letters from R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L.

Let’s list possible patterns:
- _ A T _ _
- _ _ T A _
- _ _ T _ A

Common letters left: C, D, F, G, H, K, M, P, V, W.

Let’s think of words fitting these patterns:
- CATCH: T in 3, A in 2 and 4 → but A appears twice, which is possible.
- DAMPS: but S is excluded.
- HAPPY: but P is allowed, Y is allowed, but A is in 3 → no, T must be in 3.
- CAVIT: but I is excluded.
- MADAM: but M and D are allowed, A is allowed, but I is excluded (from until feedback I(x)).

Wait, in until feedback, I(x) says I is not in the word. So letters allowed so far:
Known in word: T (position 3).
Known letters in word but position unknown: A.
Known letters NOT in word: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L.

So the word is _ _ T _ _ with A somewhere (positions 2, 4, or 5).

Possible words:
- CATCH (C, A, T, C, H) → T in 3, A in 2 and 4. But we only know one A exists, not necessarily two. Still, it’s a valid guess.
- HAPPY (H, A, P, P, Y) → T is not in 3. No.
- DARTY: but R is excluded.
- PARTY: R excluded.
- CAVY: too short.
- MAMBA: but M, A, M, B, A → T must be in 3, so this is invalid.

Another approach: use common letters left. Let’s try CATCH as it uses C, H and repeats A, but that might be risky.

Alternatively, think of words with A in position 4 or 5:
- TACHY: but Y is allowed, C, H, Y are allowed. T in 3, A in 2, but we want A in 4 or 5.
- TAWNY: T in 3, A in 2 → no.
- TABBY: T in 3, A in 2 → no.
- TACKY: T in 3, A in 2 → no.

Words with A in position 4:
- _ _ T A _
Possible: D T A? No. C T A? No. M T A? No. P T A? No. 

Words with A in position 5:
- _ _ T _ A
Possible: C D T A? No. M D T A? No. 

Hmm, let’s list letters left: A, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A must be in position 2, 4, or 5. T is in 3.

Let’s try CATCH as it has A in 2 and 4, and uses C, H.

But CATCH has two A’s, which might be possible. Alternatively, think of words with single A.

Another word: DATCH: but D, A, T, C, H → T in 3, A in 2. Uses D, C, H.

But DATCH is not a common word. 

Another: MACHO: but O is excluded.

Another: PACTS: S excluded.

Another: WACKY: but Y is allowed, W, A, C, K, Y → T must be in 3, so no.

Wait, let’s focus on valid 5-letter words. 

A valid word with T in 3, A somewhere (2,4,5), and no excluded letters:

- CATCH (valid word, though uncommon)
- DATCH (not standard)
- HATCH (H, A, T, C, H) → valid, has A in 2 and H in 1 and 5.

HATCH is a valid word: H, A, T, C, H. It has:
- H in 1 and 5 (allowed)
- A in 2 (allowed position)
- T in 3 (confirmed)
- C in 4 (allowed)

No excluded letters. This seems like a good guess.

Let me verify:
- Letters used: H, A, T, C, H
- Excluded letters: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L — none of these appear in HATCH.
- T is in position 3 (correct).
- A is in position 2 (allowed, since A must be somewhere and positions 1,3,4,5 are excluded for A from previous feedback).

Thus, HATCH is a valid next guess.Based on the feedback so far, the secret word:
- Must have T in position 3 (✓ from until).
- Must contain A, but A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (from arose and until). The only remaining possible position for A is position 2.

Therefore, the word must be of the form: _ A T _ _

Looking at common letters still allowed (not excluded: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L) and considering position 1, 4, 5, a valid word that fits is:

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: until -> FEEDBACK: U(x) N(x) T(✓) I(x) L(x)
Guess 3: hatch -> FEEDBACK: H(x) A(✓) T(✓) C(x) H(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Current constraints:
1. T is confirmed in position 3 (✓ from until and hatch).
2. A is confirmed in position 2 (✓ from hatch).
3. Letters known NOT in the word: R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L, H, C.

So the word pattern is: _ A T _ _

Letters still allowed: A, B, D, F, G, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a valid 5-letter word with:
- Position 2 = A
- Position 3 = T
- No other letters from the excluded list.

Possible words:
- BATTY: but Y is allowed, B is allowed → fits pattern _ A T _ _
- DATTY: D, A, T, T, Y → double T, but T is already in position 3, so this would be invalid (T cannot appear twice in the word based on current feedback).
- FATTY: F, A, T, T, Y → same issue.
- MATTY: M, A, T, T, Y → same issue.
- GATTY: G, A, T, T, Y → same issue.

Wait, the word could have another T elsewhere, but the feedback does not preclude multiple Ts. However, the feedback only shows one T confirmed in position 3, so we cannot assume there is only one T.

But looking for common words _ A T _ _ with allowed letters:
- BATTY: valid word, uses B and Y (both allowed), and has another T which is not ruled out.
- DATTY: not a standard word.
- FATTY: not standard.
- GATTY: not standard.

Another valid word: PATTY (P, A, T, T, Y) — but T appears twice. This is actually a valid English word (as in ""a patty""), and the double T is acceptable.

Let me verify:
- PATTY: P, A, T, T, Y
- Excluded letters: none of R, O, S, E, U, N, I, L, H, C appear.
- T is in position 3 (confirmed).
- A is in position 2 (confirmed).

Thus, PATTY is a valid next guess.

The only unknown position is the first letter. It must be a letter not in the forbidden set and must create a valid 5-letter English word. Available letters (excluding the forbidden ones) include: A, B, D, F, G, J, K, M, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Looking for real words that fit “?ATTY”:

- BATTY  – valid (colloquial, but accepted in Scrabble lists)
- DATTY  – not a standard word
- FATTY  – not standard
- GATTY  – not standard
- JATTY  – not standard
- KATTY  – not standard
- MATTY  – valid (common nickname)
- VATTY  – not standard
- WATTY  – not standard
- XATTY  – not standard
- ZATTY  – not standard

The two dictionary-valid candidates are BATTY and MATTY. Between them, MATTY is more common.
