### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This typically means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:

- SLATE: Contains S, L, A, T, E (very common letters)
- CRANE: Contains C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: Contains A, D, I, E, U (many vowels)
- RAISE: Contains R, A, I, S, E

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. R and S are very common consonants in English words
2. It has three vowels (A, I, E) which helps test for vowel positions
3. It covers a good range of letters without too much overlap

So, ""RAISE"" is a strong first guess to maximize information gain.

- MOUNT: same issue, no A.
- PLANT: has A (position 3), and P, L, N, T are new letters.
- CHALK: has A (position 2) – but A is currently in position 2 in RAISE and was marked “-” meaning it’s in the word but wrong position, so position 2 is wrong. We should avoid position 2 for A.

From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R, I, S, E are out of the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - All other letters (R, I, S, E) are out.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(-) T(-)
   - P and L are out.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it was marked “-” again).
   - N and T are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely excluded: R, I, S, E, P, L
- Letters definitely included: A, N, T
- Positions:
   – A is in the word but NOT at positions 2 or 3.
   – N is in the word but NOT at position 4.
   – T is in the word but NOT at position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, N, T (each once).
- A must be in position 1, 4 or 5.
- N must be in position 1, 2, 3 or 5.
- T must be in position 1, 2, 3 or 4.
- May not contain any of the excluded letters: R, I, S, E, P, L.

Let’s list possible placements:
- A can be at 1, 4, 5
- N can be at 1, 2, 3, 5
- T can be at 1, 2, 3, 4

We want to find a valid combination. Trying A at position 1:
A _ _ _ _  
Then N and T must be in positions 2,3,4 (but N can also be 5, T can also be 5, but A is already 1).  
Trying A=1, N=2, T=3,4:  
- A N T ? ?  → but we need 5 letters, and A,N,T must appear once each.  
Trying A=1, N=4, T=2,3:  
- A T N ? ?  → but then we have A,T,N and need two more letters.  
But we already have A,T,N in the word, so the remaining two letters must be from the unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We need to pick two new letters that are not yet used.  

A simple candidate: A T N ? ?  
But we need to fill positions 4 and 5 with new letters not yet used.  
For example: A T N O M → but this is 5 letters, contains A,T,N,O,M.  
But we know N is in the word but not at position 4, so N could be at 5.  
Trying A=1, N=5, T=2,3,4:  
- A T _ N _  or A _ T N _  or A _ _ N T  
But A is at 1, N at 5, so T must be in 2,3,4.  
Trying A=1, T=2, N=5:  
- A T _ _ N  
We need two new letters in positions 3 and 4.  
Possible: A T O M N → but M and O are new, and this satisfies:  
- A(1) – allowed (position 1)  
- T(2) – allowed (position 2)  
- N(5) – allowed (position 5)  
And the word ATONN is invalid (double N).  
Trying A=1, T=3, N=5:  
- A _ T _ N → A C T O N → C and O are new, ACTON is a valid word.  
Checking constraints:  
- A(1) – allowed (not 2 or 3)  
- T(3) – allowed (not 5)  
- N(5) – allowed (not 4)  
And ACTON uses only allowed letters and includes A,T,N once each.  

Therefore, ACTON is a good next guess.

We need to pick two new letters that are not yet used.  

A simple candidate: A T N ? ?  
But we need to fill positions 4 and 5 with new letters not yet used.  
For example: A T N O M → but this is 5 letters, contains A,T,N,O,M.  
But we know N is in the word but not at position 4, so N could be at 5.  
Trying A=1, N=5, T=2,3,4:  
- A T _ N _  or A _ T N _  or A _ _ N T  
But A is at 1, N at 5, so T must be in 2,3,4.  
Trying A=1, T=2, N=5:  
- A T _ _ N  
We need two new letters in positions 3 and 4.  
Possible: A T O M N → but M and O are new, and this satisfies:

- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This typically means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:

- SLATE: Contains S, L, A, T, E (very common letters)
- CRANE: Contains C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: Contains A, D, I, E, U (many vowels)
- RAISE: Contains R, A, I, S, E

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. R and S are very common consonants in English words
2. It has three vowels (A, I, E) which helps test for vowel positions
3. It covers a good range of letters without too much overlap

So, ""RAISE"" is a strong first guess to maximize information gain.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 2).
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely excluded: R, I, S, E
- Letter definitely included: A (but not in position 2)
- Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, O, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, U, etc.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 2)
2. Does not contain R, I, S, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good candidates:
- COUNT: has A? No, but it has O, U, N, T – we could try this if we wanted to test more consonants.
- MOUNT: same issue, no A.
- PLANT: has A (position 3), and P, L, N, T are new letters.
- CHALK: has A (position 2) – but A is currently in position 2 in RAISE and was marked “-” meaning it’s in the word but wrong position, so position 2 is wrong. We should avoid position 2 for A.
- BLOAT: has A (position 4), and B, L, O, T are new.

“PLANT” seems good because:
- A is in position 3 (not 2, so compatible with “-” feedback)
- Includes P, L, N, T – all new letters
- Avoids R, I, S, E

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R, I, S, E are out of the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - All other letters (R, I, S, E) are out.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(-) T(-)
   - P and L are out.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it was marked “-” again).
   - N and T are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely excluded: R, I, S, E, P, L
- Letters definitely included: A, N, T
- Positions:
   – A is in the word but NOT at positions 2 or 3.
   – N is in the word but NOT at position 4.
   – T is in the word but NOT at position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, N, T (each once).
- A must be in position 1, 4 or 5.
- N must be in position 1, 2, 3 or 5.
- T must be in position 1, 2, 3 or 4.
- May not contain any of the excluded letters: R, I, S, E, P, L.

Let’s list possible placements:
- A can be at 1, 4, 5
- N can be at 1, 2, 3, 5
- T can be at 1, 2, 3, 4

We want to find a valid combination. Trying A at position 1:
A _ _ _ _  
Then N and T must be in positions 2,3,4 (but N can also be 5, T can also be 5, but A is already 1).  
Trying A=1, N=2, T=3,4:  
- A N T ? ?  → but we need 5 letters, and A,N,T must appear once each.  
Trying A=1, N=4, T=2,3:  
- A T N ? ?  → but then we have A,T,N and need two more letters.  
But we already have A,T,N in the word, so the remaining two letters must be from the unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We need to pick two new letters that are not yet used.  

A simple candidate: A T N ? ?  
But we need to fill positions 4 and 5 with new letters not yet used.  
For example: A T N O M → but this is 5 letters, contains A,T,N,O,M.  
But we know N is in the word but not at position 4, so N could be at 5.  
Trying A=1, N=5, T=2,3,4:  
- A T _ N _  or A _ T N _  or A _ _ N T  
But A is at 1, N at 5, so T must be in 2,3,4.  
Trying A=1, T=2, N=5:  
- A T _ _ N  
We need two new letters in positions 3 and 4.  
Possible: A T O M N → but M and O are new, and this satisfies:  
- A(1) – allowed (position 1)  
- T(2) – allowed (position 2)  
- N(5) – allowed (position 5)  
And the word ATONN is invalid (double N).  
Trying A=1, T=3, N=5:  
- A _ T _ N → A C T O N → C and O are new, ACTON is a valid word.  
Checking constraints:  
- A(1) – allowed (not 2 or 3)  
- T(3) – allowed (not 5)  
- N(5) – allowed (not 4)  
And ACTON uses only allowed letters and includes A,T,N once each.  

Therefore, ACTON is a good next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Excluded letters: R, I, S, E, P, L, C  
Included letters: A, N, T, O

Position constraints after each guess:
- A: not in positions 2, 3, 1 (from RAISE, PLANT, ACTON)  
  ⇒ A must be in position 4 or 5.

- N: not in positions 4, 5 (from PLANT, ACTON)  
  ⇒ N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

- T: not in positions 3, 5 (from PLANT, ACTON)  
  ⇒ T must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

- O: not in position 4 (from ACTON)  
  ⇒ O must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains exactly one each of A, N, T, O and one additional unused letter.
2. Places these four required letters in allowed positions.
3. Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Unused common letters not yet tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place the four known letters first while respecting their position bans.

Option 1: A in position 4  
Then:
- N must be in 1, 2, or 3
- T must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 is taken by A) ⇒ T in 1, 2, or 3
- O must be in 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is free)

We need to fit N, T, O into remaining slots while avoiding banned positions.

Example arrangement:
- Position 1: T (allowed)
- Position 2: N (allowed)
- Position 3: O (allowed)
- Position 4: A (required)
- Position 5: one unused letter (e.g., M)

This gives the word T N O A M → TN OAM → but we need a valid English word.  
""TONAM"" is invalid.  

Option 2: A in position 5  
Then:
- N must be in 1, 2, or 3
- T must be in 1, 2, or 4
- O must be in 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is taken by A) ⇒ O in 1, 2, or 4

Let’s try:
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: one unused letter (e.g., D)
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: A

This gives N T D O A → NTOOA → invalid (double O and A at 5).  

Another arrangement:
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: one unused letter (e.g., M)
- Position 5: A

This gives N O T M A → NOTMA → invalid.  

Another arrangement:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: one unused letter (e.g., D)
- Position 5: A

This gives O N T D A → ONTDA → invalid.  

Another arrangement:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: one unused letter (e.g., D)
- Position 5: A

This gives O T N D A → OTNDA → invalid.  

We need a valid English word. Let’s look for known 5-letter words that contain A, N, T, O once each, plus one more letter, and fit the position bans.

Looking at the constraints:
- A must be 4 or 5
- N must be 1, 2, or 3
- T must be 1, 2, or 4
- O must be 1, 2, or 5

One valid word that meets these constraints is ""ANTON"":
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- N is in position 1 (allowed)
- T is in position 3 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- The fifth letter is another N, but we already have N in 1 – this would be invalid (double N).

Next candidate: ""TANGO"":
- T in 1 (allowed)
- A in 2 – but A cannot be in 2 (from RAISE) – invalid.

Next candidate: ""TONAL"":
- T in 1 (allowed)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- A in 4 (allowed)
- L is excluded – invalid.

Next candidate: ""NO TAL"" – L excluded.

Next candidate: ""DONAT"":
- D is unused
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- A in 4 (allowed)
- T in 5 – but T cannot be in 5 (from PLANT) – invalid.

Next candidate: ""ADMON"":
- A in 1 – but A cannot be in 1 (from ACTON) – invalid.

Next candidate: ""MONTA"":
- M is unused
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- T in 4 (allowed)
- A in 5 (allowed)
This fits all constraints:
- Excluded letters: none of M, O, N, T, A are excluded.
- Position checks:
  - A (5) – allowed (not 2,3,1)
  - N (3) – allowed (not 4,5)
  - T (4) – allowed (not 3,5)
  - O (2) – allowed (not 4)
  - M is a new unused letter.

""MONTA"" is a valid English word (variant spelling of ""mountain"" in some dialects, and recognized in Scrabble lists).

Therefore, MONTA is a good next guess.

For the first guess, we want to choose a word that maximizes the information gained. This typically means selecting a word with common letters that can help eliminate many possibilities. Common starting words include:

- SLATE: Contains S, L, A, T, E (very common letters)
- CRANE: Contains C, R, A, N, E
- ADIEU: Contains A, D, I, E, U (many vowels)
- RAISE: Contains R, A, I, S, E

Among these, ""RAISE"" is particularly good because:
1. R and S are very common consonants in English words
2. It has three vowels (A, I, E) which helps test for vowel positions
3. It covers a good range of letters without too much overlap

So, ""RAISE"" is a strong first guess to maximize information gain.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 2).
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(x) → E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely excluded: R, I, S, E
- Letter definitely included: A (but not in position 2)
- Remaining common letters we haven’t tried yet: T, O, N, L, C, D, M, P, B, U, etc.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains A (but not in position 2)
2. Does not contain R, I, S, E
3. Uses other common letters to maximize information

Good candidates:
- COUNT: has A? No, but it has O, U, N, T – we could try this if we wanted to test more consonants.
- MOUNT: same issue, no A.
- PLANT: has A (position 3), and P, L, N, T are new letters.
- CHALK: has A (position 2) – but A is currently in position 2 in RAISE and was marked “-” meaning it’s in the word but wrong position, so position 2 is wrong. We should avoid position 2 for A.
- BLOAT: has A (position 4), and B, L, O, T are new.

“PLANT” seems good because:
- A is in position 3 (not 2, so compatible with “-” feedback)
- Includes P, L, N, T – all new letters
- Avoids R, I, S, E

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: RAISE -> FEEDBACK: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
Guess 2: PLANT -> FEEDBACK: P(x) L(x) A(-) N(-) T(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. RAISE → R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(x)
   - R, I, S, E are out of the word.
   - A is in the word but not in position 2.
   - All other letters (R, I, S, E) are out.

2. PLANT → P(x) L(x) A(-) N(-) T(-)
   - P and L are out.
   - A is in the word but not in position 3 (it was marked “-” again).
   - N and T are in the word but in the wrong positions.

So we now know:
- Letters definitely excluded: R, I, S, E, P, L
- Letters definitely included: A, N, T
- Positions:
   – A is in the word but NOT at positions 2 or 3.
   – N is in the word but NOT at position 4.
   – T is in the word but NOT at position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Contains A, N, T (each once).
- A must be in position 1, 4 or 5.
- N must be in position 1, 2, 3 or 5.
- T must be in position 1, 2, 3 or 4.
- May not contain any of the excluded letters: R, I, S, E, P, L.

Let’s list possible placements:
- A can be at 1, 4, 5
- N can be at 1, 2, 3, 5
- T can be at 1, 2, 3, 4

We want to find a valid combination. Trying A at position 1:
A _ _ _ _  
Then N and T must be in positions 2,3,4 (but N can also be 5, T can also be 5, but A is already 1).  
Trying A=1, N=2, T=3,4:  
- A N T ? ?  → but we need 5 letters, and A,N,T must appear once each.  
Trying A=1, N=4, T=2,3:  
- A T N ? ?  → but then we have A,T,N and need two more letters.  
But we already have A,T,N in the word, so the remaining two letters must be from the unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
We need to pick two new letters that are not yet used.  

A simple candidate: A T N ? ?  
But we need to fill positions 4 and 5 with new letters not yet used.  
For example: A T N O M → but this is 5 letters, contains A,T,N,O,M.  
But we know N is in the word but not at position 4, so N could be at 5.  
Trying A=1, N=5, T=2,3,4:  
- A T _ N _  or A _ T N _  or A _ _ N T  
But A is at 1, N at 5, so T must be in 2,3,4.  
Trying A=1, T=2, N=5:  
- A T _ _ N  
We need two new letters in positions 3 and 4.  
Possible: A T O M N → but M and O are new, and this satisfies:  
- A(1) – allowed (position 1)  
- T(2) – allowed (position 2)  
- N(5) – allowed (position 5)  
And the word ATONN is invalid (double N).  
Trying A=1, T=3, N=5:  
- A _ T _ N → A C T O N → C and O are new, ACTON is a valid word.  
Checking constraints:  
- A(1) – allowed (not 2 or 3)  
- T(3) – allowed (not 5)  
- N(5) – allowed (not 4)  
And ACTON uses only allowed letters and includes A,T,N once each.  

Therefore, ACTON is a good next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Excluded letters: R, I, S, E, P, L, C  
Included letters: A, N, T, O  
(All four of these must appear exactly once in the final word.)

Position constraints after each guess:
- A: not in positions 2, 3, 1 (from RAISE, PLANT, ACTON)  
  ⇒ A must be in position 4 or 5.

- N: not in positions 4, 5 (from PLANT, ACTON)  
  ⇒ N must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

- T: not in positions 3, 5 (from PLANT, ACTON)  
  ⇒ T must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

- O: not in position 4 (from ACTON)  
  ⇒ O must be in position 1, 2, or 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains exactly one each of A, N, T, O and one additional unused letter.
2. Places these four required letters in allowed positions.
3. Uses only letters not yet excluded.

Unused common letters not yet tried: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let’s try to place the four known letters first while respecting their position bans.

Option 1: A in position 4  
Then:
- N must be in 1, 2, or 3
- T must be in 1, 2, or 4 (but 4 is taken by A) ⇒ T in 1, 2, or 3
- O must be in 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is free)

We need to fit N, T, O into remaining slots while avoiding banned positions.

Example arrangement:
- Position 1: T (allowed)
- Position 2: N (allowed)
- Position 3: O (allowed)
- Position 4: A (required)
- Position 5: one unused letter (e.g., M)

This gives the word T N O A M → TN OAM → but we need a valid English word.  
""TONAM"" is invalid.  

Option 2: A in position 5  
Then:
- N must be in 1, 2, or 3
- T must be in 1, 2, or 4
- O must be in 1, 2, or 5 (but 5 is taken by A) ⇒ O in 1, 2, or 4

Let’s try:
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: one unused letter (e.g., D)
- Position 4: O
- Position 5: A

This gives N T D O A → NTOOA → invalid (double O and A at 5).  

Another arrangement:
- Position 1: N
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: one unused letter (e.g., M)
- Position 5: A

This gives N O T M A → NOTMA → invalid.  

Another arrangement:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: N
- Position 3: T
- Position 4: one unused letter (e.g., D)
- Position 5: A

This gives O N T D A → ONTDA → invalid.  

Another arrangement:
- Position 1: O
- Position 2: T
- Position 3: N
- Position 4: one unused letter (e.g., D)
- Position 5: A

This gives O T N D A → OTNDA → invalid.  

We need a valid English word. Let’s look for known 5-letter words that contain A, N, T, O once each, plus one more letter, and fit the position bans.

Looking at the constraints:
- A must be 4 or 5
- N must be 1, 2, or 3
- T must be 1, 2, or 4
- O must be 1, 2, or 5

One valid word that meets these constraints is ""ANTON"":
- A is in position 4 (allowed)
- N is in position 1 (allowed)
- T is in position 3 (allowed)
- O is in position 2 (allowed)
- The fifth letter is another N, but we already have N in 1 – this would be invalid (double N).

Next candidate: ""TANGO"":
- T in 1 (allowed)
- A in 2 – but A cannot be in 2 (from RAISE) – invalid.

Next candidate: ""TONAL"":
- T in 1 (allowed)
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- A in 4 (allowed)
- L is excluded – invalid.

Next candidate: ""NO TAL"" – L excluded.

Next candidate: ""DONAT"":
- D is unused
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- A in 4 (allowed)
- T in 5 – but T cannot be in 5 (from PLANT) – invalid.

Next candidate: ""ADMON"":
- A in 1 – but A cannot be in 1 (from ACTON) – invalid.

Next candidate: ""MONTA"":
- M is unused
- O in 2 (allowed)
- N in 3 (allowed)
- T in 4 (allowed)
- A in 5 (allowed)
This fits all constraints:
- Excluded letters: none of M, O, N, T, A are excluded.
- Position checks:
  - A (5) – allowed (not 2,3,1)
  - N (3) – allowed (not 4,5)
  - T (4) – allowed (not 3,5)
  - O (2) – allowed (not 4)
  - M is a new unused letter.

""MONTA"" is a valid English word (variant spelling of ""mountain"" in some dialects, and recognized in Scrabble lists).

Therefore, MONTA is a good next guess.

  – A is in position 5 (✓).
  – T is in the word but NOT in position 4 (because in MONTA it was marked “-” at position 4, so it must be elsewhere).

Letters already excluded: R, I, S, E, P, L, C, M.

So T must be in position 1 or 2, but position 2 is already O, hence T must be in position 1.

Hence the word must be T O N _ A, with the blank being a letter not yet excluded.

Available letters (not yet excluded and not yet used): B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter English word that starts with TON and ends with A, with one letter in between.

Possible valid words:
- TONGA – but G is available and not excluded.
- TONIA – but I is excluded.
- TONNA – but N is already used once (and we have only one N confirmed so far).
- TONFA – F is available.
- TONGA, TONFA, TONHA, etc.

Looking for the most common among these, TONGA (a ridge in the brain) is valid, but let’s pick the more everyday TONFA (a type of handlebar mustache).

However, TONFA might not be widely recognized. The most common everyday word fitting is TONGA, but let’s check:

TONGA is valid (Scrabble word list), but let’s pick the more common TONFA.

Actually, the most common everyday word is TONIA, but I is excluded.

Next best is TONGA.

But let’s double-check: TONGA is valid.

Another option is TONDA – but D is available.

Wait, let me quickly scan: TON_A with N in 3, O in 2, A in 5, T in 1.

Possible: T O N _ A.

Available letters: B, D, F, G, H, J, K, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Valid English words:
- TONGA
- TONFA
- TONHA
- TONDA
- TONVA

Among these, TONGA is the most common.

So the next logical guess is TONGA.
