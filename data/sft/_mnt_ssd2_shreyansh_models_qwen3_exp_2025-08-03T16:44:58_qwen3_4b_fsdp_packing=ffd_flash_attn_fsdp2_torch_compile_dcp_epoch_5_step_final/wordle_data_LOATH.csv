For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should have a mix of these vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- CRANE (uses C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (uses S, L, A, T, E)
- CRATE (uses C, R, A, T, E)
- RAISE (uses R, A, I, S, E)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it covers 5 of the most common letters (C, R, A, N, E) and provides good coverage for consonants and vowels.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) – C is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- A(✓) – A is in the word and in the correct position (3rd spot).
- N(x) – N is not in the word.
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Word pattern: _ _ A _ _
- Letters definitely excluded: C, R, N, E
- We still need to test other common letters (S, T, L, O, I, U, D, M, etc.) to find the remaining consonants and vowels.

A good next guess should:
1. Keep A in the 3rd position.
2. Use new letters we haven’t tested yet.
3. Avoid C, R, N, E.

Popular patterns that fit: STAIR, SLASH, PLANK, PLAYS, STAMP, etc.  
I’ll pick “STAIR” because it tests S, T, I, and R (but R is already ruled out). Oops, R is excluded. Let’s try “PLAYS” – P, L, Y, S. But Y is less common. “SLASH” – S, L, S, H. Two S’s, but S is frequent. “STAMP” – S, T, M, P. Also good. I’ll go with STAMP.

Another check: CRANE feedback shows A is locked in 3rd, so STAMP fits _ _ A _ _ only if we consider the 3rd letter as A. Actually, STAMP is S T A M P, so the 3rd letter is A, and the rest are new letters. Perfect.

From the two guesses we have:

1. CRANE → C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(x)
   - A is fixed in the 3rd position.

   - S, M, P are not in the word.
   - New exclusions: S, M, P.

- T must appear somewhere (not in position 2).
- Letters definitely out: C, R, N, E, S, M, P.

Remaining common letters to test: D, L, B, G, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Since T must appear and isn’t in position 2, let’s try a word that places T in position 1, 4, or 5, while introducing new common consonants and vowels.

A good candidate is “TOWER”:
- T in position 1 (possible for T).
- O new vowel.
- W new consonant.
- E but E is already ruled out. Oops.

Next candidate: “TOADY” – Y is acceptable, but D is new, A is fixed, but T is in position 1. However, “TOADY” has A in position 3, so it’s _ _ A _ _.

Wait, “TOADY” is T O A D Y – A is in position 3, T in 1, O in 2, D in 4, Y in 5. This tests O, D, Y, and places T in position 1. This seems good.

Another check: no ruled-out letters are used. T is allowed in position 1.

Thus, TOADY is a valid next guess.

So far we know:
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _
- T must appear somewhere (not in position 2).
- Letters definitely out: C, R, N, E, S, M, P.

Remaining common letters to test: D, L, B, G, K, V, W, Y, etc.

Since T must appear and isn’t in position 2, let’s try a word that places T in position 1, 4, or 5, while introducing new common consonants and vowels.

A good candidate is “TOWER”:
- T in position 1 (possible for T).
- O new vowel.
- W new consonant.
- E but E is already ruled out. Oops.

Next candidate: “TOADY” – Y is acceptable, but D is new, A is fixed, but T is in position 1. However, “TOADY” has A in position 3, so it’s _ _ A _ _.

Wait, “TOADY” is T O A D Y – A is in position 3, T in 1, O in 2, D in 4, Y in 5. This tests O, D, Y, and places T in position 1. This seems good.

Another check: no ruled-out letters are used. T is allowed in position 1.

Thus, TOADY is a valid next guess.

Current knowledge:

1. Position 3 is A (locked).
2. O is in the word and in the correct position (position 2).
3. T is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from feedback: T(-) in both STAMP and TOADY).
   Therefore T must be in position 4 or 5.
4. Letters ruled out so far: C, R, N, E, S, M, P, D, Y.

So the pattern is now:
- Position 2: O
- Position 3: A
- Position 4 or 5: T
- Positions 1, 4/5: must be from remaining common letters (B, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, Q, U, V, W, X, Z)

We need a 5-letter English word that fits:
_ O A _ _ with T in position 4 or 5.

Possible candidates:
- BOAT_ : but we need T, so BOAT_ doesn’t work.
- FOAT_ : same issue.
- GOAT_ : same.
- HOAG_ : H O A G _, but T isn’t placed.
- Looking for words like _ O A T _ or _ O A _ T.

Common words fitting _ O A _ T:
- GOATE (but E is ruled out)
- HOAGT (not a word)
- LOATH (but H is allowed, and T is in position 5)
- BOAST (but S is ruled out)
- FOAT_ doesn’t exist.
- VOAT_ doesn’t exist.

Looking at _ O A T _:
- GOAT_ doesn’t fit.
- BOAT_ doesn’t fit.

Looking at _ O A _ T:
- LOATH is L O A T H, but H is allowed, and T is in position 5. However, LOATH is a valid word (archaic, but acceptable in Scrabble lists).
- Another is BOAT_ doesn’t fit.
- HOAGT is invalid.
- COAT_ invalid (C ruled out).
- VOAT_ invalid.

Actually, let me think differently: _ O A _ T.

Valid words:
- LOATH (L O A T H) – H is allowed.
- GOAT_ doesn’t fit.
- BOAT_ doesn’t fit.

Is LOATH acceptable? Yes, it’s in many word lists.

Another check: letters used in LOATH – L, O, A, T, H – none are ruled out except H is new but that’s fine.

Thus, LOATH is a good next guess.
