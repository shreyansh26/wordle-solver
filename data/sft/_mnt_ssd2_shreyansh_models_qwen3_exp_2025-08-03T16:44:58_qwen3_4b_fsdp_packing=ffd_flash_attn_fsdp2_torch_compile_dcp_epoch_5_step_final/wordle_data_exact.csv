Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to make a strategic choice. The best opening words in Wordle typically use common letters and provide good coverage of vowels and consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (covers many vowels but not great consonants)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R: Very common consonant, often at word endings
- A: Most common vowel
- I: Another common vowel
- S: Common consonant, often pluralizes words
- E: Most common letter in English

This gives good coverage of common letters and positions.

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is not in the word.

- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: R, I, S
- Letters definitely present: A, E
- A is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E
2. Does not contain R, I, or S
3. Has A not in position 2 and E not in position 5

Good candidate letters (excluding R, I, S): A, E, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Words with A and E, avoiding R, I, S, and E not in position 5:
- MUST have A and E
- MUST NOT have R, I, S
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4

Combining the constraints:
- Letters definitely absent: R, I, S, B, Y
- Letters definitely present: A, E
- A cannot be in positions 1 or 2
- E cannot be in positions 4 or 5

So A must be in position 3, 4, or 5
And E must be in position 1, 2, or 3

Possible positions:
Let’s list valid placements of A and E:

A could be at 3, 4, 5
E could be at 1, 2, 3

We need a 5-letter word with A and E, no R, I, S, B, Y, and respecting the positions above.

Looking for words:
- If E is at 1, A could be at 3, 4, 5
- If E is at 2, A could be at 3, 4, 5
- If E is at 3, A could be at 3 (but can’t be same position), 4, 5

Let’s try E at 1, A at 3:
E _ A _ _

Possible letters left (excluding R,I,S,B,Y): C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Z

- E L A N E → E L A N E → ELANE? Not valid
- E L A V E → E L A V E → ELAVE? Not valid

Let me check constraints for ELATE:
- Letters: E, L, A, T, E
- R, I, S, B, Y not present → OK
- Contains A and E → OK
- A is at position 3 (not 1 or 2) → OK

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to make a strategic choice. The best opening words in Wordle typically use common letters and provide good coverage of vowels and consonants. 

Some popular starting words include:
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- RAISE (covers R, A, I, S, E)
- ADIEU (covers many vowels but not great consonants)

I'll choose ""RAISE"" because it includes:
- R: Very common consonant, often at word endings
- A: Most common vowel
- I: Another common vowel
- S: Common consonant, often pluralizes words
- E: Most common letter in English

This gives good coverage of common letters and positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

From the feedback on RAISE:
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 2.
- I(x) → I is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: R, I, S
- Letters definitely present: A, E
- A is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both A and E
2. Does not contain R, I, or S
3. Has A not in position 2 and E not in position 5

Good candidate letters (excluding R, I, S): A, E, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z

Let me think of words that fit:
- Must have A and E
- Must not have R, I, S
- Must have A not in position 2 and E not in position 5

Possible candidates:
- TABLE: A in 2, E in 5 → reject (A is position 2, E is position 5)
- CABLE: A in 2, E in 5 → reject
- HEAVE: A in 3, E in 5 → reject (E is position 5)
- BAKE: 4 letters → reject
- LANCE: A in 2, E in 5 → reject
- CANOE: A in 2, E in 5 → reject
- PEACH: A in 3, E in 5 → reject (E is position 5)
- PLATE: A in 2, E in 5 → reject
- CLATE: A in 2, E in 5 → reject
- GLOVE: no A → reject
- CHAFE: A in 3, E in 5 → reject (E is position 5)
- DRAPE: has R → reject
- GRAPE: has R → reject
- CRANE: has R → reject

- LEAVE: E in 5 → reject
- BEEPS: no A → reject
- MELON: no A → reject
- PEONS: no A → reject
- BEGUM: no A → reject
- AGING: no E → reject
- ABODE: A in 1, E in 5 → reject (E is position 5)
- AGAVE: E in 5 → reject
- ALONE: E in 5 → reject
- ABOVE: E in 5 → reject
- ADOBE: E in 5 → reject
- AGAVE: E in 5 → reject
- AFOGE: E in 5 → reject
- AGREE: has R → reject
- AGAVE: E in 5 → reject
- AGING: no E → reject
- AGAVE: E in 5 → reject
- AGAVE: E in 5 → reject

I'm having trouble finding words with A and E, without R, I, S, and with E not in position 5. Let me broaden the search.

Words with A and E, avoiding R, I, S, and E not in position 5:
- MUST have A and E
- MUST NOT have R, I, S
- E can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4
- A can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (since it can't be in position 2)

Possible candidates:
- AMBLE: A in 1, E in 5 → reject (E is position 5)
- ABBEY: A in 1, E in 4 → valid (E is position 4, A is position 1)
- ABBEY: has B, B, E, Y - but we need 5 letters
- ABBEY: valid word, but let's check letters: A, B, B, E, Y - no R, I, S, contains A and E, positions: A in 1 (allowed), E in 4 (allowed)

ABBEY seems valid:
- Contains A and E
- Does not contain R, I, S
- A is in position 1 (allowed)
- E is in position 4 (allowed)

Another candidate:
- ABBOT: no E → reject
- ABLE: 4 letters → reject
- ABODE: E in 5 → reject
- AFOGE: E in 5 → reject
- AGAVE: E in 5 → reject
- ALONE: E in 5 → reject
- ABOVE: E in 5 → reject
- ADOBE: E in 5 → reject
- ABBEY: seems the only valid word fitting the constraints

Let me confirm:
ABBEY:
- A in 1 (not 2) ✓
- E in 4 (not 5) ✓
- No R, I, S ✓
- Contains A and E ✓
- Valid 5-letter word ✓

Therefore, ABBEY is a good next guess.Based on the feedback from RAISE, we know:
- R, I, S are not in the word.
- A and E are in the word, but A is not in position 2 and E is not in position 5.

A good next guess is ABBEY, as it:
1. Contains both A and E.
2. Does not contain R, I, or S.
3. Has A in position 1 (not 2) and E in position 4 (not 5).

Let's digest the new feedback from ELATE:

E(✓)  – E is correct in position 1.
L(x)  – L is not in the word at all.
A(✓)  – A is correct in position 3.
T(-)  – T is in the word but not in position 4.
E(-)  – The second E is in the word but not in position 5.

So far we know:

Letters fixed:
1: E  
3: A  

Letters definitely present but misplaced:
- T (cannot be at 4)
- E (cannot be at 5)

Letters definitely absent:
R, I, S, B, Y, L

Letters still available (excluding the above): C, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, U, V, W, X, Z

We have the pattern:
E _ A _ _

We know T must appear somewhere, and it can only be in positions 2 or 5 (since position 4 is now excluded).

We also know there must be exactly one more E somewhere, and it cannot be at 5 (from the feedback), so the second E must be at position 2 or 4. But position 4 is already taken by the feedback indicator, so the second E must be at position 2.

Thus, we have:
E E A _ _

Now we just need to decide where T goes. It cannot be at 4, so it must be at position 5.

So the word must be:
E E A _ T

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits this pattern. The only common English word that fits is:

E E A V T → but that’s not a word.
E E A N T → e.e.n.t. Not valid.
E E A G T → e.e.g.t. Not valid.

Wait, let me think of actual words:
- ""EAGET"" – not valid
- ""EAVET"" – not valid
- ""EANET"" – not valid
- ""EASET"" – not valid
- ""EAFET"" – not valid

Hmm, none of these are valid. This suggests I may have made an error in placement.

Let me re-examine the feedback:

ELATE → E(✓) L(x) A(✓) T(-) E(-)

The feedback symbols are given for each letter in order. So:

- Position 1: E is correct (✓)
- Position 2: L is incorrect (x)
- Position 3: A is correct (✓)
- Position 4: T is in word but wrong position (-)
- Position 5: E is in word but wrong position (-)

This means:
- Word starts with E
- Has A in position 3
- Contains T somewhere (not position 4)
- Contains E somewhere (not position 5)

So possible positions:
E _ A _ _

T can be at position 2 or 5 (since 1,3,4 are taken or excluded)
E can be at position 2 or 4 (since 1,3,5 are excluded)

Let's consider possibilities:

Case 1: T at position 2
E T A _ _

Then E must be at position 4 (since it can't be at 5)
E T A E _

We need a valid word in the pattern E T A E _. The only common word is:

E T A E D – but that’s not valid.
E T A E R – invalid.
E T A E N – invalid.
Actually, ""ETAGE"" is a valid word (though uncommon), but let me check if there's a more common one.

Case 2: T at position 5
E _ A _ T

Then E must be at position 2 or 4. Position 2 is E, so:
E E A _ T – but we need a letter in position 4. Possible letters from remaining set.

Looking at valid words:
- ""EAGET"" – invalid
- ""EANET"" – invalid
- ""EAVET"" – invalid
- ""EAFET"" – invalid
- ""EAKET"" – invalid
- ""EAMET"" – invalid
- ""EAPET"" – invalid
- ""EAS ET"" – invalid

Wait, let me think of actual words that fit E _ A _ T:
- ""ECLAT"" – but L is already excluded.
- ""EXACT"" – but X is allowed, C is allowed, but let's check:
EXACT:
1: E ✓
2: X (allowed)
3: A ✓
4: C (allowed)
5: T ✓ (since T must be in word, and position 5 is allowed)

But we have to ensure T is in the word. In this case, T is at position 5, which satisfies ""T is in word but not at position 4"". This seems valid.

Let me check if there are any conflicts:
- Letters used: E, X, A, C, T
- All letters are allowed (no R, I, S, B, Y, L)
- Positions:
1: E ✓
2: X (no constraint)
3: A ✓
4: C (no constraint)
5: T ✓ (since T must appear somewhere, and this is allowed)

This seems to satisfy all constraints.

Based on the feedback:
- E is fixed in position 1
- A is fixed in position 3
- T must appear somewhere (not position 4)
- Another E must appear somewhere (not position 5)
- L is eliminated

The pattern E _ A _ _ with T and E fitting the constraints leads to the valid word EXACT.
