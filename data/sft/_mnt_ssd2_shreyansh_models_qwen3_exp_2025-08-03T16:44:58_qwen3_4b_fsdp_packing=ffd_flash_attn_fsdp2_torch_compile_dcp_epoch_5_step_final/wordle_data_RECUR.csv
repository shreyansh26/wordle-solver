For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us coverage of 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the information we can get from the feedback.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S
- R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, S
3. Has R not in position 2 and E not in position 5

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A and O are out)

Let’s try to place R and E in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- U and I are new vowels
- N, T are new consonants
- Contains E (but E is in position 4, which is allowed since it’s not position 5)
- Contains R (but R is in position 3, which is allowed since it’s not position 2)
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S)

However, ""UNTIE"" might not be the best because E is in position 4 and R in 3, but we need to check if this leads to more information. Another option is ""TREND"":
- T, N, D are new letters
- R in position 2 (but R cannot be in position 2 from feedback)
So this is invalid.

Better option: ""CRUEL"":
- C, U, L are new letters
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- R in position 2 (invalid, R cannot be in position 2)

Next option: ""MERIT"":
- M, I, T are new letters
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 4 (allowed)
This seems good.

But let’s verify:
- Letters: M, E, R, I, T
- Contains R and E
- No A, O, S
- R is in position 4 (allowed)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)

This is a strong candidate. Alternatively, ""URINE"":
- U, I, N are new letters
- R in position 2 (invalid)

""INERT"":
- I, N, T are new letters
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
This is also good.

Between MERIT and INERT, both seem strong. ""INERT"" might be slightly better as it places E in position 4 and R in 5, which are both allowed and common positions.

But let me think of a word that places E and R in more informative positions. ""ENTER"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- N, T are new letters
- R in position 5 (allowed)
This is valid and covers E in position 1 and R in position 5, which are both allowed by the feedback.

This seems like the best choice.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Letters in the word: R (fixed in position 5), E (somewhere else, not position 1 or 5).

Letters NOT in the word: A, O, S, N, T.

Remaining consonants that might appear: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.  
Remaining vowels: I, U.

Good candidate structure: _ _ _ E R or _ _ E _ R or _ E _ _ R

- CEDER – but “CEDER” is not a standard word.
- FERER – not valid.
- MERER – not valid.
- PERER – not valid.
- BERER – not valid.
- DERER – not valid.
- HERR… – needs a valid 5-letter word.

A valid word is “HERRY” but Y is allowed (not ruled out). However, “HERRY” has two R’s and we already know R is in position 5, so this would duplicate R, which is possible but less informative.

Another valid word: “PERCH” – but T is already ruled out, and H, C, P are allowed. However, this doesn’t use E.

We must include E. Let’s try:
- “PERCH” – no E.
- “CHEER” – has two E’s, one in position 3, one in 4. Valid word, uses E and places it in 3, and R is fixed in 5. Letters used: C, H, E, E, R. No forbidden letters.

“CHEER” seems perfect:
- R in position 5 (✓)
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- C, H are new letters

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us coverage of 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the information we can get from the feedback.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S
- R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, S
3. Has R not in position 2 and E not in position 5

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A and O are out)

Let’s try to place R and E in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- U and I are new vowels
- N, T are new consonants
- Contains E (but E is in position 4, which is allowed since it’s not position 5)
- Contains R (but R is in position 3, which is allowed since it’s not position 2)
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S)

However, ""UNTIE"" might not be the best because E is in position 4 and R in 3, but we need to check if this leads to more information. Another option is ""TREND"":
- T, N, D are new letters
- R in position 2 (but R cannot be in position 2 from feedback)
So this is invalid.

Better option: ""CRUEL"":
- C, U, L are new letters
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- R in position 2 (invalid, R cannot be in position 2)

Next option: ""MERIT"":
- M, I, T are new letters
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 4 (allowed)
This seems good.

But let’s verify:
- Letters: M, E, R, I, T
- Contains R and E
- No A, O, S
- R is in position 4 (allowed)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)

This is a strong candidate. Alternatively, ""URINE"":
- U, I, N are new letters
- R in position 2 (invalid)

""INERT"":
- I, N, T are new letters
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
This is also good.

Between MERIT and INERT, both seem strong. ""INERT"" might be slightly better as it places E in position 4 and R in 5, which are both allowed and common positions.

But let me think of a word that places E and R in more informative positions. ""ENTER"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- N, T are new letters
- R in position 5 (allowed)
This is valid and covers E in position 1 and R in position 5, which are both allowed by the feedback.

This seems like the best choice.

From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

Remaining consonants that might appear: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A valid word is “HERRY” but Y is allowed (not ruled out). However, “HERRY” has two R’s and we already know R is in position 5, so this would duplicate R, which is possible but less informative.

Another valid word: “PERCH” – but T is already ruled out, and H, C, P are allowed. However, this doesn’t use E.

We must include E. Let’s try:
- “PERCH” – no E.
- “CHEER” – has two E’s, one in position 3, one in 4. Valid word, uses E and places it in 3, and R is fixed in 5. Letters used: C, H, E, E, R. No forbidden letters.

“CHEER” seems perfect:
- R in position 5 (✓)
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- C, H are new letters

Let’s update what we now know after the three guesses.

Letters in the word (must be true):

- E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from Guess 1, 2, 3)
  → E must be in position 2

Letters NOT in the word (x feedback):
- A, O, S, N, T, H

So the pattern so far is:

- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: any letter except A, O, S, N, T, H
- Position 4: any letter except A, O, S, N, T, H

Vowels: I, U  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2
2. Has R in position 5
3. Uses only the remaining letters
4. Is a real English word

Candidate structure: _ E _ _ R

- Position 1: any letter except A, O, S, N, T, H
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: any letter except A, O, S, N, T, H
- Position 4: any letter except A, O, S, N, T, H
- Position 5: R (fixed)

Remaining usable letters (not yet ruled out):
Vowels: I, U  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2
2. Has R in position 5
3. Uses only the remaining letters
4. Is a real English word

Candidate structure: _ E _ _ R

Let’s look for real words fitting this:
- B E G E R → “BEGER” is not valid.
- D E V E R → “DEV ER” is not valid.
- F E V E R → “FEVER” is valid.
- L E V E R → “LEVER” is valid.
- M E V E R → not valid.
- P E V E R → not valid.
- V E V E R → not valid.
- W E V E R → not valid.

Between FEWER and LEVER:
- FEWER: F, E, W, E, R → W is allowed (not yet ruled out), and F is allowed.
- LEVER: L, E, V, E, R → L and V are allowed.

Both are valid, but FEWER introduces F and W, while LEVER introduces L and V. Either is good, but FEWER is more common.

Let’s go with FEWER.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently appearing letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

The word ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us coverage of 5 different letters that appear frequently in English words, maximizing the information we can get from the feedback.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x) → O is not in the word.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: R, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, O, S
- R is not in position 2, E is not in position 5.

We need a new 5-letter word that:
1. Contains R and E
2. Does not contain A, O, S
3. Has R not in position 2 and E not in position 5

Good remaining consonants to try: T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, etc.
Good remaining vowels to try: I, U (since A and O are out)

Let’s try to place R and E in new positions while introducing new common letters. A good candidate is ""UNTIE"":
- U and I are new vowels
- N, T are new consonants
- Contains E (but E is in position 4, which is allowed since it’s not position 5)
- Contains R (but R is in position 3, which is allowed since it’s not position 2)
- No forbidden letters (A, O, S)

However, ""UNTIE"" might not be the best because E is in position 4 and R in 3, but we need to check if this leads to more information. Another option is ""TREND"":
- T, N, D are new letters
- R in position 2 (but R cannot be in position 2 from feedback)
So this is invalid.

Better option: ""CRUEL"":
- C, U, L are new letters
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- R in position 2 (invalid, R cannot be in position 2)

Next option: ""MERIT"":
- M, I, T are new letters
- E in position 2 (allowed)
- R in position 4 (allowed)
This seems good.

But let’s verify:
- Letters: M, E, R, I, T
- Contains R and E
- No A, O, S
- R is in position 4 (allowed)
- E is in position 2 (allowed)

This is a strong candidate. Alternatively, ""URINE"":
- U, I, N are new letters
- R in position 2 (invalid)

""INERT"":
- I, N, T are new letters
- E in position 4 (allowed)
- R in position 5 (allowed)
This is also good.

Between MERIT and INERT, both seem strong. ""INERT"" might be slightly better as it places E in position 4 and R in 5, which are both allowed and common positions.

But let me think of a word that places E and R in more informative positions. ""ENTER"":
- E in position 1 (allowed)
- N, T are new letters
- R in position 5 (allowed)
This is valid and covers E in position 1 and R in position 5, which are both allowed by the feedback.

This seems like the best choice.

Good candidate structure: _ _ _ E R or _ _ E _ R or _ E _ _ R

Let’s look for common words that fit:
- CEDER – but “CEDER” is not a standard word.
- FERER – not valid.
- MERER – not valid.
- PERER – not valid.
- BERER – not valid.
- DERER – not valid.
- HERR… – needs a valid 5-letter word.

A valid word is “HERRY” but Y is allowed (not ruled out). However, “HERRY” has two R’s and we already know R is in position 5, so this would duplicate R, which is possible but less informative.

Another valid word: “PERCH” – but T is already ruled out, and H, C, P are allowed. However, this doesn’t use E.

We must include E. Let’s try:
- “PERCH” – no E.
- “CHEER” – has two E’s, one in position 3, one in 4. Valid word, uses E and places it in 3, and R is fixed in 5. Letters used: C, H, E, E, R. No forbidden letters.

“CHEER” seems perfect:
- R in position 5 (✓)
- E in position 3 (allowed)
- C, H are new letters
- No A, O, S, N, T
- Valid 5-letter word

Let’s verify:
- C: new
- H: new
- E: must be in 3 (since 1 and 5 are ruled out)
- E: second occurrence is fine
- R: must be in 5 (✓)

- E is in the word but NOT in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (from Guess 1, 2, 3)
  → E must be in position 2

Letters NOT in the word (x feedback):
- A, O, S, N, T, H

So the pattern so far is:
- Position 1: any letter except A, O, S, N, T, H
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: any letter except A, O, S, N, T, H
- Position 4: any letter except A, O, S, N, T, H
- Position 5: R (fixed)

Remaining usable letters (not yet ruled out):
Vowels: I, U  
Consonants: B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2
2. Has R in position 5
3. Uses only the remaining letters
4. Is a real English word

Candidate structure: _ E _ _ R

Let’s look for real words fitting this:
- B E G E R → “BEGER” is not valid.
- D E V E R → “DEV ER” is not valid.
- F E V E R → “FEVER” is valid.
- L E V E R → “LEVER” is valid.
- M E V E R → not valid.
- P E V E R → not valid.
- V E V E R → not valid.

Between FEWER and LEVER:
- FEWER: F, E, W, E, R → W is allowed (not yet ruled out), and F is allowed.
- LEVER: L, E, V, E, R → L and V are allowed.

Both are valid, but FEWER introduces F and W, while LEVER introduces L and V. Either is good, but FEWER is more common.

- Position 1: any of B, C, D, G, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, I, U
- Position 2: E (fixed)
- Position 3: any of B, C, D, G, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, I, U
- Position 4: any of B, C, D, G, K, L, M, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z, I, U
- Position 5: R (fixed)

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits _ E _ _ R.

Real words fitting this pattern:
- B E G E R → invalid (no E in position 4)
- C E D E R → invalid
- D E V E R → invalid
- L E V E R → invalid
- M E D E R → invalid
- V E V E R → invalid
- P E C E R → invalid
- C E V E R → invalid
- K E V E R → invalid
- G E V E R → invalid
- B E V E R → invalid
- D E V E R → invalid
- L E V E R → valid

Wait, only ""LEVER"" seems valid among these. Let me double-check:

- L, E, V, E, R: L and V are allowed (not yet ruled out), E is allowed in position 2 (fixed), R is fixed in position 5. The word ""LEVER"" is indeed valid.

No other common word fits _ E _ _ R with only allowed letters. Thus, ""LEVER"" is our only remaining candidate.

Letters already ruled out (x feedback):  
A, O, S, N, T, H, F, W, L, V

Remaining possible letters for positions 1, 3, 4:  
B, C, D, G, K, M, P, Q, X, Y, Z, I, U

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches _ E _ _ R using only these letters.

Scanning the remaining letters for any valid word:

- B, C, D, G, K, M, P, Q, X, Y, Z, I, U

The only common English word that fits is:

M E D E R → but D and E are allowed, and MEDER is a valid (though rare) word.

Another possibility is:

B E D E R → B and D and E and R are allowed, and ""BEDER"" is a valid word.

But ""BEDER"" is more common than ""MEDER"".

However, let me double-check: is ""BEDER"" a valid word? Yes, it's an old variant spelling of ""bider"" or can describe a type of wood.

But perhaps there's a simpler, more common word. 

Looking again:

With letters left: B, C, D, G, K, M, P, Q, X, Y, Z, I, U.

The most straightforward valid word is:
