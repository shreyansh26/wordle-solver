- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, I, O, T, N, S, L, C. A good starting word should cover several of these. 

Some popular strong starting words include:
- CRANE (covers C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (covers S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (covers C, R, I, S, P)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's widely considered a good starting word due to its use of very common letters in key positions.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C: not in the word (x)
- R: not in the word (x)
- A: correct position (✓) at position 3
- N: not in the word (x)
- E: in the word but wrong position (-)

So we know:
1. The word has A in the 3rd position.
2. It contains E somewhere, but not at position 5.
3. It does NOT contain C, R, or N.

Letters still available: B, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, O, P, Q, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since E cannot be at position 5, it must be at 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is excluded), so 1, 2, or 4. A is locked at 3.

I want a word with A in position 3, E somewhere else, and avoiding C, R, N. Good letters to try next include S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Possible candidates:
- SLATE: but N is already excluded, and L/T are good. However, A is not in position 3 here (it's 2nd). Wait no, SLATE is S L A T E, so A is 3rd. But E is 5th, which is excluded. So SLATE is invalid.
- PLATE: P L A T E, same issue with E at 5th.
- GLADE: G L A D E, E at 5th again excluded.
- LEAPT: E at 1st, A at 3rd. Letters: L, E, A, P, T. No C, R, N. This could work.

But let me think of a better word. Maybe something with E at 2nd or 4th. 

""BEACH"" has A in 3rd, E in 2nd, and avoids C, R, N. But H is okay. 
- B E A C H: C is excluded, so this is invalid.

""PEACH"": same issue with C.

""HEADY"": H E A D Y, A at 3rd, E at 2nd, no C/R/N. This seems good. 

But is ""HEADY"" a valid word? Yes, it means relating to or resembling a head.

Another option: ""LEAFY"" - but Y is okay, and avoids C/R/N. 
- L E A F Y: A at 3rd, E at 2nd. 

But ""LEAFY"" has Y at 5th, which is allowed. 

Alternatively, ""DESKY"" - but S is okay, K is okay. 
- D E S K Y: A is not in 3rd here.

Wait, I need A in 3rd. So ""HEADY"" or ""LEAFY"" are better. 

""HEADY"" uses H, D, Y which are all allowed. 

Another candidate: ""PEACH"" - but C is excluded. 

""HEART"": but R is excluded. 

""PEAKY"": P E A K Y, A at 3rd, E at 2nd, no C/R/N. 

This seems strong.

Based on the feedback from CRANE, we know:
- A is correctly placed in position 3.
- E is in the word but not in position 5.
- C, R, N are not in the word.

A good next word should have A in position 3, include E elsewhere, and use new letters. ""PEAKY"" fits these criteria:
- P, E, A, K, Y are all new letters.
- A is in position 3.
- E is in position 2 (valid since E just needs to be somewhere, not position 5).

So far we know:

- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, P, K, Y  
- Remaining common letters to try: S, L, T, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, B, F, etc.

2. Uses only allowed letters (not C, R, N, P, K, Y).  
3. Introduces new, high-value letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, U).

Candidate words:
- SLATE: S L A T E → pattern _ _ A _ E, not _ E A _ _  
- STAGE: S T A G E → pattern _ _ A _ E  
- LEASE: L E A S E → pattern _ E A _ E (but E is already known to be in position 2)  
- HEAST: H E A S T → fits _ E A _ _ and uses H, S, T (all allowed).  

""HEAST"" is valid (though rare), but let’s pick a more common word with the same pattern.  
""STEAM"" doesn’t fit the pattern.  
""BEAST"" fits: B E A S T.  

Check letters: B, E, A, S, T.  
- Forbidden letters: none of B, S, T are forbidden.  
- Pattern: _ E A _ _ → B E A S T has B at 1 and S at 4, T at 5.  

This looks perfect.

<guess>BEAST</guess>",BEAST,"From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: CRANE  
Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(✓) N(x) E(-)  
- A is fixed in position 3.  
- E is in the word but not in position 5.  

Guess 2: PEAKY  
Feedback: P(x) E(✓) A(✓) K(x) Y(x)  
- E is now fixed in position 2.  
- A remains in position 3.  
- P, K, Y are not in the word.  

So far we know:
- Positions: _ E A _ _  
- Forbidden letters: C, R, N, P, K, Y  
- Remaining common letters to try: S, L, T, I, O, U, D, G, H, M, B, F, etc.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has the pattern _ E A _ _  
2. Uses only allowed letters (not C, R, N, P, K, Y).  
3. Introduces new, high-value letters (e.g., S, T, L, O, U).

Candidate words:
- SLATE: S L A T E → pattern _ _ A _ E, not _ E A _ _  
- STAGE: S T A G E → pattern _ _ A _ E  
- LEASE: L E A S E → pattern _ E A _ E (but E is already known to be in position 2)  
- HEAST: H E A S T → fits _ E A _ _ and uses H, S, T (all allowed).  

""HEAST"" is valid (though rare), but let’s pick a more common word with the same pattern.  
""STEAM"" doesn’t fit the pattern.  
""BEAST"" fits: B E A S T.  

Check letters: B, E, A, S, T.  
- Forbidden letters: none of B, S, T are forbidden.  
- Pattern: _ E A _ _ → B E A S T has B at 1 and S at 4, T at 5.  

This looks perfect.",Guess 3: BEAST -> FEEDBACK: B(✓) E(✓) A(✓) S(✓) T(✓),SUCCESS
