### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and vowels to maximize information gain. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

All five letters A, R, O, S, E are not in the secret word (each got “x”), so I must pick a word that avoids these entirely.  
I need a fresh set of high-frequency letters. The next-most-common consonants left are T, N, L, C, D, H, M, P, B, F, G, U, Y, K, V, W, X, Z, Q, J.  
The most common vowel still in play is I (since A, O, E are ruled out).  
A good starting word that uses only still-possible letters is “UNTIL” (U, N, T, I, L).  
Another candidate is “BUILD” (B, U, I, L, D).  
I’ll choose “UNTIL” because it hits several common consonants and the remaining vowels.

(If the feedback shows any hits, I can refine from there.)

So far we know:
- Letters already ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
- From guess 2 we learned:
  – I and L are both in the word but in wrong positions (they showed “-”).

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains both I and L (and only letters not yet ruled out).
2. Places I and L in different positions than they had in UNTIL (I≠4, L≠5).
3. Uses other common remaining letters to maximize information.

Candidate words:
- LIVED  (L, I, V, E, D) – but E is already ruled out.
- BILGE  (B, I, L, G, E) – E ruled out.
- CLIMB  (C, L, I, M, B) – uses C, L, I, M, B; positions: I≠4, L≠5.
- FLICK  (F, L, I, C, K) – uses F, L, I, C, K; positions: I≠4, L≠5.
- GUILD  (G, U, I, L, D) – U ruled out.
- BLIMP  (B, L, I, M, P) – uses B, L, I, M, P; positions: I≠4, L≠5.

Among these, “CLIMB” and “FLICK” are strong. I’ll choose “FLICK” because it introduces F, C, K and keeps I and L in new positions (I≠4, L≠5).

In F L I C K:
- F: new letter, any position.
- L: was in position 5 (UNTIL), now in position 2 – different.

Current knowledge:
- Letters ruled out: A, R, O, S, E, U, N, T, C, K
- Letters confirmed: F (correct in 1st position)
- Letters known to be in the word but not yet placed: I, L
- Remaining unused letters: B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z

We have the pattern: F _ _ _ _

We know I and L must appear somewhere in positions 2-5, and they cannot be in the same positions they had in previous guesses:
- I cannot be in position 3 (from FLICK)
- I cannot be in position 4 (from UNTIL)
- L cannot be in position 2 (from FLICK)
- L cannot be in position 5 (from UNTIL)

So possible positions:
- I can be in positions 2 or 5
- L can be in positions 3 or 4

We need a 5-letter word starting with F, containing I and L, with I in 2 or 5, and L in 3 or 4, and using only allowed letters.

Possible combinations:
1. F I L _ _
   - Need two more letters. Possible letters left: B, D, G, H, J, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z
   - Need to pick two letters that form a valid word. Possible endings: ""IL"" + something
   - ""FILMY"" - uses F, I, L, M, Y
   - ""FILCH"" - uses F, I, L, C, H - but C is ruled out
   - ""FILIP"" - uses F, I, L, I, P - but I is already used
   - ""FILGA"" - invalid (A ruled out)
   - ""FILMY"" seems valid

2. F _ L _ _
   - I must be in position 5
   - Need letters in positions 2 and 3, and 4
   - Possible: F _ L _ I
   - Need letters not ruled out
   - ""FULGI"" - U is ruled out
   - ""FELLI"" - E is ruled out
   - ""FALGI"" - A is ruled out
   - ""FORLI"" - O is ruled out
   - ""FOLGI"" - O is ruled out
   - ""FILGI"" - I is already in position 3 (but I can be in position 2 or 5)
   - ""FILMI"" - I is in position 3, but I can be in position 2 or 5
   - ""FILMY"" seems better as it places I in position 2 and L in position 3

""FILMY"" fits all constraints:
- Starts with F (correct position)
- Contains I and L
- I is in position 2 (new position)
- L is in position 3 (new position)
- Uses allowed letters M and Y
