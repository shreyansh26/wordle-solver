### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This combination will help quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

   - E, which was already fixed in position 5, is now shown as “in the word but wrong position” – this is expected because the feedback system checks each guess independently. It does not change the known fact that E must be in position 5.
   - T, N, Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Letters definitely NOT present: A, R, S, T, N, Y
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not yet ruled out).

Next move:
- Fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with new letters that fit _ O _ _ E and avoid the forbidden set.
- Common patterns that fit: 
  - B O _ _ E (e.g., BOGIE, BOWEL)

  - D O _ _ E (e.g., DOGME, DOPEY – but P, E, Y; Y is forbidden)

  - M O _ _ E (e.g., MOLE, MOLE – L, E allowed)
  - P O _ _ E (e.g., POEM, POESY – S, Y forbidden)

A valid word that fits _ O _ _ E and avoids all forbidden letters is “MOLE”:

- Fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with new letters that fit _ O _ _ E and avoid the forbidden set.
- Common patterns that fit: 
  - B O _ _ E (e.g., BOGIE, BOWEL)
  - C O _ _ E (e.g., CLOWN is invalid because W is allowed but N is forbidden)
  - D O _ _ E (e.g., DOGME, DOPEY – but P, E, Y; Y is forbidden)
  - F O _ _ E (e.g., FORGE, FORGE – R is forbidden)
  - G O _ _ E (e.g., GLOBE, GLOBE – L, B allowed)
  - H O _ _ E (e.g., HOPEY – P, Y; Y forbidden)
  - K O _ _ E (e.g., KNOLE – N forbidden)
  - L O _ _ E (e.g., LOBES, LOVER – V, R forbidden)
  - M O _ _ E (e.g., MOLE, MOLE – L, E allowed)
  - P O _ _ E (e.g., POEM, POESY – S, Y forbidden)

A valid word that fits _ O _ _ E and avoids all forbidden letters is “MOLE”:
- M, O, L, E – but MOLE is 4 letters, so invalid.
Another: “GLOBE” – G, L, O, B, E – all allowed letters, and it fits _ O _ _ E.

Check GLOBE:
- G (allowed), L (allowed), O (fixed at position 2), B (allowed), E (fixed at position 5).
- No forbidden letters used.

So “GLOBE” is a good next guess.

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. toney → T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
   - O is confirmed in position 2.
   - E is still in position 5 (the “-” here only tells us E is elsewhere, which is already known to be in position 5, so no new info).
   - T, N, Y are out.

3. globe → G(-) L(x) O(-) B(x) E(✓)
   - G is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, B are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent with earlier).
   - E is still in position 5.

So far:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Letters confirmed: O (position 2), E (position 5), G (somewhere, not position 1)
- Letters ruled out: A, R, S, T, N, Y, L, B
- G must be in position 3 or 4.

Possible words fitting _ O _ _ E:
- G must be in position 3 or 4.
- Other positions must use allowed letters (C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).

Let's list:
- _ O G _ E: e.g., DOGME (M allowed, but E is already in position 5)
- _ O _ G E: e.g., MOGUE (M, U allowed) – but Mogue is not a common word.

Looking for common words:
- DOGME – not a word.
- FOGIE – F, I allowed, but E is already at end.
- HOGUE – H, U allowed, but not a standard word.
- MOGUE – same issue.
- POGUE – P, U allowed, but again not a standard word.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe G is in position 4:
- _ O _ G E: e.g., MOGGE – not valid.
- _ O _ G E: e.g., DOGGE – not valid.
- _ O _ G E: e.g., FOGEY – F, J, Y – but Y is ruled out.
- _ O _ G E: e.g., HOGEY – H, Y – Y ruled out.
- _ O _ G E: e.g., WOGUE – W, U, G, E – W and U allowed, but WOGUE is not a standard word.

Hmm, maybe G is in position 3:
- _ O G _ E: e.g., DOGME – not a word.
- _ O G _ E: e.g., FOGEY – Y ruled out.
- _ O G _ E: e.g., MOGGE – not a word.
- _ O G _ E: e.g., COGGE – not a word.

Let me reconsider. Perhaps I missed a word. Let's list all _ O _ _ E words with G in position 3 or 4, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus O and E already placed).

Looking for common words:
- DOGME – no.
- FOGIE – F, I, E – but E is at position 5, so FOGIE is F O G I E – that's 5 letters, and G is in position 3. Is FOGIE a word? Yes, it's a variant spelling of ""fogey"".

But FOGIE uses I, which is allowed, and F, G, I, E – all allowed letters. Let me check if any letters are ruled out: F, I, G, E are all allowed.

So FOGIE seems valid:
- F O G I E
- G is in position 3 (allowed), O in 2, E in 5.

Is there a better common word? Let me think of others:
- MOGUE – not common.
- HOGEY – not common.
- WOGUE – not common.

FOGIE seems the most plausible common word fitting the constraints.

Therefore, my next guess is FOGIE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This combination will help quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 3).
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (currently at position 5).

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains O somewhere, but not in position 3.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
I want a word that:
1. Has E in position 5 (already fixed).
2. Places O in a different position (not 3).
3. Avoids A, R, S.
4. Introduces new common consonants and vowels.

A good candidate is ""TONEY"":
- T, O, N, E, Y.
- E is in position 5 (✓).
- O is in position 2 (different from position 3).
- Avoids A, R, S.
- Introduces T, N, Y.

Let me check if TONEY is a valid 5-letter word: yes, it is (a nickname for ""tony"" or ""toney"" as an archaic variant of ""tongue"").

Let's update the state after the fourth guess.

Current confirmed facts:
- Positions: _ O _ _ E
- Letters confirmed: O (pos 2), E (pos 5)
- Letters confirmed present but position unknown: G (not in pos 1, not in pos 4)
- Letters ruled out: A, R, S, T, N, Y, L, B, F, I

So:
- G must be in position 3 or 4, but from feedback:
  - G(-) in guess 3 (not in pos 1)
  - G(-) in guess 4 (not in pos 4)
  Therefore G must be in position 3.

Hence the pattern is: _ O G _ E

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

We need a 5-letter word with:
- pos 1: any of C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
- pos 3: G
- pos 5: E
- pos 2: O
- pos 4: any of allowed letters (but must form a valid word)

Looking for common words matching _ O G _ E:
- DOGME – not a word
- MOGGE – not a word
- HOGUE – not a word
- COGGE – not a word
- WOGUE – not a word
- JOGGE – Jogging without the 'n'... not a standard word
- DOGGE – not a word
- MOGIE – not a word
- HOGEY – not a word

Wait, let's think of actual valid words:
- MOGUL – but ends with L (ruled out)
- DOGMY – not a word
- COGUM – not a word

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing. Let me list all valid _ O G _ E words with allowed letters.

Valid English words fitting _ O G _ E with letters from remaining allowed set:
- MOGUE – but 'U' is allowed, and 'M' is allowed. Is Mogue valid? Yes, it's a variant spelling of 'mogul' or can refer to a mugger.

But Mogue uses U and M, both allowed. Let me check:
- M O G U E – all letters allowed, forms a valid word.

Is there a more common word? Let me see:
- DOGUE – not a word
- COGUE – not a word
- HOGUE – not a word
- JOGUE – not a word
- WOGUE – not a word

Mogue seems to be the only valid word left fitting the pattern with allowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess is MOGUE.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to maximize information gain.

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent first guess because it contains:
- 3 vowels (A, O, E)
- 2 very common consonants (R, S)

This combination will help quickly identify which vowels and consonants are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- O(-) → O is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 3).
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in the correct position (currently at position 5).

So far we know:
- The word ends with E.
- It contains O somewhere, but not in position 3.
- It does NOT contain A, R, or S.

Good letters to try next: T, N, L, C, D, G, H, I, K, M, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.
I want a word that:
1. Has E in position 5 (already fixed).
2. Places O in a different position (not 3).
3. Avoids A, R, S.
4. Introduces new common consonants and vowels.

A good candidate is ""TONEY"":
- T, O, N, E, Y.
- E is in position 5 (✓).
- O is in position 2 (different from position 3).
- Avoids A, R, S.
- Introduces T, N, Y.

Let me check if TONEY is a valid 5-letter word: yes, it is (a nickname for ""tony"" or ""toney"" as an archaic variant of ""tongue"").

From the two rounds of feedback:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. toney → T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
   - O is now confirmed in position 2.
   - E, which was already fixed in position 5, is now shown as “in the word but wrong position” – this is expected because the feedback system checks each guess independently. It does not change the known fact that E must be in position 5.
   - T, N, Y are not in the word.

So far we know:
- Word pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Letters definitely NOT present: A, R, S, T, N, Y
- Letters still possible: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus any others not yet ruled out).

Next move:
- Fill positions 1, 3, and 4 with new letters that fit _ O _ _ E and avoid the forbidden set.
- Common patterns that fit: 
  - B O _ _ E (e.g., BOGIE, BOWEL)
  - C O _ _ E (e.g., CLOWN is invalid because W is allowed but N is forbidden)
  - D O _ _ E (e.g., DOGME, DOPEY – but P, E, Y; Y is forbidden)
  - F O _ _ E (e.g., FORGE, FORGE – R is forbidden)
  - G O _ _ E (e.g., GLOBE, GLOBE – L, B allowed)
  - H O _ _ E (e.g., HOPEY – P, Y; Y forbidden)
  - K O _ _ E (e.g., KNOLE – N forbidden)
  - L O _ _ E (e.g., LOBES, LOVER – V, R forbidden)
  - M O _ _ E (e.g., MOLE, MOLE – L, E allowed)
  - P O _ _ E (e.g., POEM, POESY – S, Y forbidden)

A valid word that fits _ O _ _ E and avoids all forbidden letters is “MOLE”:
- M, O, L, E – but MOLE is 4 letters, so invalid.
Another: “GLOBE” – G, L, O, B, E – all allowed letters, and it fits _ O _ _ E.

Check GLOBE:
- G (allowed), L (allowed), O (fixed at position 2), B (allowed), E (fixed at position 5).
- No forbidden letters used.

So “GLOBE” is a good next guess.

Let's consolidate what we now know after three guesses.

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
   - E is fixed in position 5.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3.

2. toney → T(x) O(✓) N(x) E(-) Y(x)
   - O is confirmed in position 2.
   - E is still in position 5 (the “-” here only tells us E is elsewhere, which is already known to be in position 5, so no new info).
   - T, N, Y are out.

3. globe → G(-) L(x) O(-) B(x) E(✓)
   - G is in the word but not in position 1.
   - L, B are out.
   - O is in the word but not in position 3 (consistent with earlier).
   - E is still in position 5.

So far:
- Pattern: _ O _ _ E
- Letters confirmed: O (position 2), E (position 5), G (somewhere, not position 1)
- Letters ruled out: A, R, S, T, N, Y, L, B
- G must be in position 3 or 4.

Possible words fitting _ O _ _ E:
- G must be in position 3 or 4.
- Other positions must use allowed letters (C, D, F, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z).

Let's list:
- _ O G _ E: e.g., DOGME (M allowed, but E is already in position 5)
- _ O _ G E: e.g., MOGUE (M, U allowed) – but Mogue is not a common word.

Looking for common words:
- DOGME – not a word.
- FOGIE – F, I allowed, but E is already at end.
- HOGUE – H, U allowed, but not a standard word.
- MOGUE – same issue.
- POGUE – P, U allowed, but again not a standard word.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe G is in position 4:
- _ O _ G E: e.g., MOGGE – not valid.
- _ O _ G E: e.g., DOGGE – not valid.
- _ O _ G E: e.g., FOGEY – F, J, Y – but Y is ruled out.
- _ O _ G E: e.g., HOGEY – H, Y – Y ruled out.
- _ O _ G E: e.g., WOGUE – W, U, G, E – W and U allowed, but WOGUE is not a standard word.

Hmm, maybe G is in position 3:
- _ O G _ E: e.g., DOGME – not a word.
- _ O G _ E: e.g., FOGEY – Y ruled out.
- _ O G _ E: e.g., MOGGE – not a word.
- _ O G _ E: e.g., COGGE – not a word.

Let me reconsider. Perhaps I missed a word. Let's list all _ O _ _ E words with G in position 3 or 4, avoiding ruled-out letters.

Allowed letters: C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z (plus O and E already placed).

Looking for common words:
- DOGME – no.
- FOGIE – F, I, E – but E is at position 5, so FOGIE is F O G I E – that's 5 letters, and G is in position 3. Is FOGIE a word? Yes, it's a variant spelling of ""fogey"".

But FOGIE uses I, which is allowed, and F, G, I, E – all allowed letters. Let me check if any letters are ruled out: F, I, G, E are all allowed.

So FOGIE seems valid:
- F O G I E
- G is in position 3 (allowed), O in 2, E in 5.

Is there a better common word? Let me think of others:
- MOGUE – not common.
- HOGEY – not common.
- WOGUE – not common.

FOGIE seems the most plausible common word fitting the constraints.

Therefore, my next guess is FOGIE.

Current confirmed facts:

- Letters confirmed present but position unknown: G (not in pos 1, not in pos 4)
- Letters ruled out: A, R, S, T, N, Y, L, B, F, I

So:
- G must be in position 3 or 4, but from feedback:
  - G(-) in guess 3 (not in pos 1)
  - G(-) in guess 4 (not in pos 4)
  Therefore G must be in position 3.

Hence the pattern is: _ O G _ E

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): C, D, H, J, K, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

- pos 3: G

- COGUM – not a word

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing. Let me list all valid _ O G _ E words with allowed letters.

Valid English words fitting _ O G _ E with letters from remaining allowed set:
- MOGUE – but 'U' is allowed, and 'M' is allowed. Is Mogue valid? Yes, it's a variant spelling of 'mogul' or can refer to a mugger.

But Mogue uses U and M, both allowed. Let me check:
- M O G U E – all letters allowed, forms a valid word.

Is there a more common word? Let me see:
- DOGUE – not a word
- COGUE – not a word
- HOGUE – not a word
- JOGUE – not a word
- WOGUE – not a word

Mogue seems to be the only valid word left fitting the pattern with allowed letters.

Therefore, the next guess is MOGUE.

We now know:

- Pattern: _ O G _ E  
  (O in pos 2, G in pos 3, E in pos 5)

- Letters ruled out so far:  
  A, R, S, T, N, Y, L, B, F, I, M, U

- Letters still allowed for positions 1 and 4:  
  C, D, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z

We need a valid 5-letter English word that matches _ O G _ E using only these remaining letters.

Scanning the pattern:

- C O G _ E → COGNE (not a word)  
- D O G _ E → DOGME (not a word)  
- H O G _ E → HOGE? (needs a valid letter)  
- J O G _ E → JOGGE (valid word “jogging” without the n)  
- K O G _ E → KOGE? (invalid)  
- P O G _ E → POGE? (invalid)  
- V O G _ E → VOGE? (invalid)  
- W O G _ E → WOGGE (invalid)  
- X O G _ E → XOG?E (invalid)  
- Z O G _ E → ZOGE? (invalid)

The only remaining valid English word that fits is J O G G E (short for jogging).  
All letters (J, O, G, G, E) are allowed by the constraints.

So the next logical guess is JOGGE.
