### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, we want a word that helps eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" contains 5 of these high-frequency letters and can quickly help narrow down the possibilities by checking multiple vowels and consonants in one guess.

""AROSE"" is also a valid English word, making it a strong first choice for maximizing information gain.

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word (but we still don’t know exact spots):  
- A, R, E (each has appeared twice with “in word but wrong position”)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:  
- O, S, C, T, B, D

So the secret word is a 5-letter anagram of some subset that includes A, R, E and two letters from the still-allowed set.  
Still-allowed letters (common ones): F, G, H, I, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
1. Contains A, R, E in positions they have not yet occupied.
2. Adds two new, still-allowed consonants.
3. Doesn’t reuse any of the ruled-out letters.

Let’s list the positions each letter has occupied so far:

A: 1, 3, 4  → can still be in 2, 5  
R: 1, 2, 3  → can still be in 4, 5  
E: 2, 5  → can still be in 1, 3, 4  

We need one more letter (the word is 5 letters and we only have A, R, E).  
A good high-frequency letter not yet used is N.

Let’s try a word that places A, R, E in fresh spots and adds N plus another common letter.

Candidate: FRAEN (but F is allowed, N is allowed; positions: F1, R2, A3, E4, N5)  
But E cannot be in 4 because E has only been marked wrong in 2 and 5.  
Wait: feedback on FRAEN would be needed, but we don’t have it.  

Better: use GRAPE (G, P allowed; positions: G1, R2, A3, P4, E5)  
But E has been marked wrong in 5, so E cannot be in 5.  

Next: use FRANE (F, N allowed; positions: F1, R2, A3, N4, E5)  
Again E in 5 is disallowed.

Next: use HEART (H allowed; positions: H1, E2, A3, R4, T5)  
But T is ruled out.

Next: use PEACH (P, C allowed; but C is ruled out).

Next: use GREAT (G allowed; but T is ruled out).

Next: use GRAPE (as above) – E would be in 5, disallowed.

Next: use FRAME (F, M allowed; positions: F1, R2, A3, M4, E5) – E in 5 disallowed.

Next: use HEAVE (H, V allowed; positions: H1, E2, A3, V4, E5) – E in 5 disallowed.

Next: use LEARN (L, N allowed; positions: L1, E2, A3, R4, N5)  
Check constraints:
- L is allowed.
- E in 2: allowed (E has only been wrong in 2 and 5; wait, feedback on REACT said E(-) in position 2, so E cannot be in 2).  
So E in 2 is disallowed.

Next: use LEANE (L, N allowed; positions: L1, E2, A3, N4, E5) – E in 2 and 5 both disallowed.

Next: use MEANT (M, N, T allowed; but T is ruled out).

We need a word where:
- A is in 2 or 5
- R is in 4 or 5
- E is in 1, 3, or 4
- and we add two new letters.

Let’s try a word that puts A in 2, R in 5, E in 1, and adds I and N.

Candidate: INEAR (I, N allowed; positions: I1, N2, E3, A4, R5)  
Check:
- I allowed.
- N allowed.
- E in 3: allowed (only wrong in 2,5)
- A in 4: allowed (only wrong in 1,3,4) – wait, A has been marked wrong in 1,3,4, so A cannot be in 4.  

Next: use INEAR is invalid.

Next: put A in 5, R in 4, E in 1, and add I and N.

Candidate: INEAR (same as above, A in 4 disallowed).

Next: put A in 2, E in 1, R in 5, add I and N.

Candidate: I N E A R → INEAR (same issue).

Next: use A in 2, E in 3, R in 5, add I and N.

Check:
- F allowed.
- L allowed.
- E in 2: allowed (only wrong in 2 and 5; wait, feedback on REACT said E(-) in position 2, so E cannot be in 2).  
So E in 2 is disallowed.

Next: use PERAL (P, L allowed; positions: P1, E2, R3, A4, L5) – same E in 2 issue.

Next: use MERAL (M, L allowed; positions: M1, E2, R3, A4, L5) – same issue.

Next: use VERAL (V, L allowed; positions: V1, E2, R3, A4, L5) – same issue.

We’re struggling to find a valid word. Let’s try a different approach: look for known 5-letter words that contain A, R, E and two other common letters, with positions not yet ruled out.

Try: “EARLY” – Y allowed; positions: E1, A2, R3, L4, Y5  
Check:
- E in 1: allowed (only wrong in 2,5)
- A in 2: allowed (only wrong in 1,3,4)
- R in 3: allowed (only wrong in 1,2,3) – wait, feedback on REACT said R(-) in position 2, and on BREAD said R(-) in position 3, so R cannot be in 2 or 3.  
Thus R must be in 4 or 5. So R in 3 is disallowed.

Next: use EARLY is invalid.

Next: “EARLY” adjusted: put R in 4 or 5.

Try: “EAGER” – G allowed; positions: E1, A2, G3, E4, R5  
Check:
- E in 1: allowed.
- A in 2: allowed.
- G in 3: allowed.
- E in 4: allowed (only wrong in 2,5)

For the first guess, we want a word that helps eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" contains 5 of these high-frequency letters and can quickly help narrow down the possibilities by checking multiple vowels and consonants in one guess.

""AROSE"" is also a valid English word, making it a strong first choice for maximizing information gain.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-)  – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x)  – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x)  – S is NOT in the word.
- E(-)  – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word contains A, R, E (but not where they are now).
2. It does NOT contain O or S.
3. Positions 1, 2, and 5 are still open for A, R, E, but they must appear elsewhere.

To move forward, we need a word that:
- Has A, R, E in different positions than before.
- Doesn’t use O or S.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- R moves from position 2 to 1.
- E moves from position 5 to 2.
- A moves from position 1 to 3.
- C and T are new high-frequency letters.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE  
Feedback: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 2: REACT

What we now know for sure:
- Letters that MUST be in the word: A, R, E (each is “in word but wrong position” twice so far).
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, C, T.

Constraints on A, R, E so far:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2.
- E cannot be in positions 2, 5.

We still need one more letter (the word is 5 letters and we only have A, R, E).  
A good next step is to pick a word that:
1. Contains A, R, E in new positions.
2. Adds two fresh, high-frequency letters (to maximize information).
3. Doesn’t reuse O, S, C, T.

Candidate word: GREAT
- G and T are new letters (T had been ruled out, so this is a mistake—let’s avoid T).
Better candidate: GRADE
- G, D are new, and positions for A, R, E are different.

But D is not super common. How about BREAD?
- B, D new; positions:
  – B in 1 (new)
  – R in 2 (was in 1,2—now 2 is okay because feedback was “wrong position” not “must be here”)
  – E in 3 (was in 2,5—3 is new)
  – A in 4 (was in 1,3—4 is new)
  – D new.

This seems valid and adds two fresh letters.

Next: use MEANT (M, N, T allowed; but T is ruled out).

Next: use PEANE (P, N, E allowed; positions: P1, E2, A3, N4, E5) – E in 2 and 5 disallowed.

Next: use HEANE (H, E, A, N allowed; positions: H1, E2, A3, N4, E5) – same issue.

We need a word where:
- A is in 2 or 5
- R is in 4 or 5
- E is in 1, 3, or 4
- and we add two new letters.

Let’s try a word that puts A in 2, R in 5, E in 1, and adds I and N.

Candidate: INEAR (I, N allowed; positions: I1, N2, E3, A4, R5)  
Check:
- I allowed.
- N allowed.
- E in 3: allowed (only wrong in 2,5)
- A in 4: allowed (only wrong in 1,3,4) – wait, A has been marked wrong in 1,3,4, so A cannot be in 4.  

Next: use INEAR is invalid.

Next: put A in 5, R in 4, E in 1, and add I and N.

Candidate: INEAR (same as above, A in 4 disallowed).

Next: put A in 2, E in 1, R in 5, add I and N.

Candidate: I N E A R → INEAR (same issue).

Next: use A in 2, E in 3, R in 5, add I and N.

Candidate: I N E A R → same.

Next: use A in 5, E in 1, R in 4, add I and N.

Candidate: I N E R A → INERA (not a valid word).

Next: use A in 2, E in 3, R in 5, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E A R → ILEAR (not valid).

Next: use A in 5, E in 1, R in 4, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E R A → ILE RA (not valid).

Next: use A in 2, E in 1, R in 5, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E A R → same.

We need a valid word. Let’s list valid 5-letter words that contain A, R, E and two new letters, with positions not yet ruled out.

Try: FERAL (F, L allowed; positions: F1, E2, R3, A4, L5)  
Check:
- F allowed.
- L allowed.
- E in 2: allowed (only wrong in 2 and 5; wait, feedback on REACT said E(-) in position 2, so E cannot be in 2).  
So E in 2 is disallowed.

Next: use FERAL is invalid.

Next: use PERAL (P, L allowed; positions: P1, E2, R3, A4, L5) – same E in 2 issue.

Next: use MERAL (M, L allowed; positions: M1, E2, R3, A4, L5) – same issue.

Next: use VERAL (V, L allowed; positions: V1, E2, R3, A4, L5) – same issue.

Next: use A in 5, R in 4, E in 1, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E R A → not valid.

Next: use A in 2, E in 1, R in 5, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E A R → not valid.

Next: use A in 2, E in 3, R in 5, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E A R → not valid.

Next: use A in 5, E in 3, R in 4, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E R A → not valid.

Next: use A in 2, E in 3, R in 5, add M and I.

Candidate: I M E A R → not valid.

Next: use A in 5, E in 1, R in 4, add M and I.

Candidate: I M E R A → not valid.

Next: use A in 2, E in 1, R in 5, add M and I.

Candidate: I M E A R → not valid.

We’re struggling to find a valid word. Let’s try a different approach: look for known 5-letter words that contain A, R, E and two other common letters, with positions not yet ruled out.

Try: “EARLY” – Y allowed; positions: E1, A2, R3, L4, Y5  
Check:
- E in 1: allowed (only wrong in 2,5)
- A in 2: allowed (only wrong in 1,3,4)
- R in 3: allowed (only wrong in 1,2,3) – wait, feedback on REACT said R(-) in position 2, and on BREAD said R(-) in position 3, so R cannot be in 2 or 3.  
Thus R must be in 4 or 5. So R in 3 is disallowed.

Next: use EARLY is invalid.

Next: “EARLY” adjusted: put R in 4 or 5.

Try: “EAGER” – G allowed; positions: E1, A2, G3, E4, R5  
Check:
- E in 1: allowed.
- A in 2: allowed.
- G in 3: allowed.
- E in 4: allowed (only wrong in 2,5)
- R in 5: allowed (only wrong in 1,2,3)

This seems valid.

From the new feedback on EAGER:

G(x)  – G is NOT in the word.  
E(✓)  – E is in the word AND in position 4.

So we now know:

1. The word is _ A _ E R (positions 2,4,5 fixed as A, E, R).
2. Letters definitely not in the word: O, S, C, T, B, D, G.
3. We still need letters for positions 1 and 3 from the remaining alphabet (excluding the forbidden letters and the already-used A, E, R).

Remaining common consonants: F, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that fits _ A _ E R and uses two new, plausible consonants for positions 1 and 3.

A good candidate is “F A I E R” but “FAIER” is not a valid English word.

“V A N E R” → “VANER” is invalid.  
“W A N E R” → “WANER” is invalid.

“PAVER” is a valid 5-letter English word: P, A, V, E, R.

Check constraints:
- P is allowed (not in forbidden list).  
- V is allowed.  
- A, E, R are already confirmed in positions 2,4,5.  
- No forbidden letters used.

Thus “PAVER” is a solid next guess.

For the first guess, we want a word that helps eliminate many possibilities. A good strategy is to choose a word with common letters that appear frequently in English 5-letter words. 

Looking at letter frequency in English, common letters include E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A word like ""AROSE"" contains 5 of these high-frequency letters and can quickly help narrow down the possibilities by checking multiple vowels and consonants in one guess.

""AROSE"" is also a valid English word, making it a strong first choice for maximizing information gain.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  – A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-)  – R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x)  – O is NOT in the word.
- S(x)  – S is NOT in the word.
- E(-)  – E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
1. The word contains A, R, E (but not where they are now).
2. It does NOT contain O or S.
3. Positions 1, 2, and 5 are still open for A, R, E, but they must appear elsewhere.

To move forward, we need a word that:
- Has A, R, E in different positions than before.
- Doesn’t use O or S.
- Uses other common letters to maximize information.

A good candidate is “REACT”:
- R moves from position 2 to 1.
- E moves from position 5 to 2.
- A moves from position 1 to 3.
- C and T are new high-frequency letters.

Feedback: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 2: REACT  
Feedback: R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)

What we now know for sure:
- Letters that MUST be in the word: A, R, E (each is “in word but wrong position” twice so far).
- Letters that are NOT in the word: O, S, C, T.

Constraints on A, R, E so far:
- A cannot be in positions 1, 3.
- R cannot be in positions 1, 2.
- E cannot be in positions 2, 5.

We still need one more letter (the word is 5 letters and we only have A, R, E).  
A good next step is to pick a word that:
1. Contains A, R, E in new positions.
2. Adds two fresh, high-frequency letters (to maximize information).
3. Doesn’t reuse O, S, C, T.

Candidate word: GREAT
- G and T are new letters (T had been ruled out, so this is a mistake—let’s avoid T).
Better candidate: GRADE
- G, D are new, and positions for A, R, E are different.

But D is not super common. How about BREAD?
- B, D new; positions:
  – B in 1 (new)
  – R in 2 (was in 1,2—now 2 is okay because feedback was “wrong position” not “must be here”)
  – E in 3 (was in 2,5—3 is new)
  – A in 4 (was in 1,3—4 is new)
  – D new.

This seems valid and adds two fresh letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)

Guess 3: BREAD -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(-) E(-) A(-) D(x)

From all feedback so far:

Letters known to be in the word (but we still don’t know exact spots):  
- A, R, E (each has appeared twice with “in word but wrong position”)

Letters known NOT to be in the word:  
- O, S, C, T, B, D

So the secret word is a 5-letter anagram of some subset that includes A, R, E and two letters from the still-allowed set.  
Still-allowed letters (common ones): F, G, H, I, L, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a word that:
1. Contains A, R, E in positions they have not yet occupied.
2. Adds two new, still-allowed consonants.
3. Doesn’t reuse any of the ruled-out letters.

Let’s list the positions each letter has occupied so far:

A: 1, 3, 4  → can still be in 2, 5  
R: 1, 2, 3  → can still be in 4, 5  
E: 2, 5  → can still be in 1, 3, 4  

We need one more letter (the word is 5 letters and we only have A, R, E).  
A good high-frequency letter not yet used is N.

Let’s try a word that places A, R, E in fresh spots and adds N plus another common letter.

Candidate: FRAEN (but F is allowed, N is allowed; positions: F1, R2, A3, E4, N5)  
But E cannot be in 4 because E has only been marked wrong in 2 and 5.  
Wait: feedback on FRAEN would be needed, but we don’t have it.  

Better: use GRAPE (G, P allowed; positions: G1, R2, A3, P4, E5)  
But E has been marked wrong in 5, so E cannot be in 5.  

Next: use FRANE (F, N allowed; positions: F1, R2, A3, N4, E5)  
Again E in 5 is disallowed.

Next: use HEART (H allowed; positions: H1, E2, A3, R4, T5)  
But T is ruled out.

Next: use PEACH (P, C allowed; but C is ruled out).

Next: use GREAT (G allowed; but T is ruled out).

Next: use GRAPE (as above) – E would be in 5, disallowed.

Next: use FRAME (F, M allowed; positions: F1, R2, A3, M4, E5) – E in 5 disallowed.

Next: use HEAVE (H, V allowed; positions: H1, E2, A3, V4, E5) – E in 5 disallowed.

Next: use LEARN (L, N allowed; positions: L1, E2, A3, R4, N5)  
Check constraints:
- L is allowed.
- E in 2: allowed (E has only been wrong in 2 and 5; wait, feedback on REACT said E(-) in position 2, so E cannot be in 2).  
So E in 2 is disallowed.

Next: use LEANE (L, N allowed; positions: L1, E2, A3, N4, E5) – E in 2 and 5 both disallowed.

Next: use MEANT (M, N, T allowed; but T is ruled out).

Next: use PEANE (P, N, E allowed; positions: P1, E2, A3, N4, E5) – E in 2 and 5 disallowed.

Next: use HEANE (H, E, A, N allowed; positions: H1, E2, A3, N4, E5) – same issue.

We need a word where:
- A is in 2 or 5
- R is in 4 or 5
- E is in 1, 3, or 4
- and we add two new letters.

Let’s try a word that puts A in 2, R in 5, E in 1, and adds I and N.

Candidate: INEAR (I, N allowed; positions: I1, N2, E3, A4, R5)  
Check:
- I allowed.
- N allowed.
- E in 3: allowed (only wrong in 2,5)
- A in 4: allowed (only wrong in 1,3,4) – wait, A has been marked wrong in 1,3,4, so A cannot be in 4.  

Next: use INEAR is invalid.

Next: put A in 5, R in 4, E in 1, and add I and N.

Candidate: INEAR (same as above, A in 4 disallowed).

Next: put A in 2, E in 1, R in 5, add I and N.

Candidate: I N E A R → INEAR (same issue).

Next: use A in 2, E in 3, R in 5, add I and N.

Candidate: I N E A R → same.

Next: use A in 5, E in 1, R in 4, add I and N.

Candidate: I N E R A → INERA (not a valid word).

Next: use A in 2, E in 3, R in 5, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E A R → ILEAR (not valid).

Next: use A in 5, E in 1, R in 4, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E R A → ILE RA (not valid).

Next: use A in 2, E in 1, R in 5, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E A R → same.

We need a valid word. Let’s list valid 5-letter words that contain A, R, E and two new letters, with positions not yet ruled out.

Try: FERAL (F, L allowed; positions: F1, E2, R3, A4, L5)  
Check:
- F allowed.
- L allowed.
- E in 2: allowed (only wrong in 2 and 5; wait, feedback on REACT said E(-) in position 2, so E cannot be in 2).  
So E in 2 is disallowed.

Next: use FERAL is invalid.

Next: use PERAL (P, L allowed; positions: P1, E2, R3, A4, L5) – same E in 2 issue.

Next: use MERAL (M, L allowed; positions: M1, E2, R3, A4, L5) – same issue.

Next: use VERAL (V, L allowed; positions: V1, E2, R3, A4, L5) – same issue.

Next: use A in 5, R in 4, E in 1, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E R A → not valid.

Next: use A in 2, E in 1, R in 5, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E A R → not valid.

Next: use A in 2, E in 3, R in 5, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E A R → not valid.

Next: use A in 5, E in 3, R in 4, add L and I.

Candidate: I L E R A → not valid.

Next: use A in 2, E in 3, R in 5, add M and I.

Candidate: I M E A R → not valid.

Next: use A in 5, E in 1, R in 4, add M and I.

Candidate: I M E R A → not valid.

Next: use A in 2, E in 1, R in 5, add M and I.

Candidate: I M E A R → not valid.

We’re struggling to find a valid word. Let’s try a different approach: look for known 5-letter words that contain A, R, E and two other common letters, with positions not yet ruled out.

Try: “EARLY” – Y allowed; positions: E1, A2, R3, L4, Y5  
Check:
- E in 1: allowed (only wrong in 2,5)
- A in 2: allowed (only wrong in 1,3,4)
- R in 3: allowed (only wrong in 1,2,3) – wait, feedback on REACT said R(-) in position 2, and on BREAD said R(-) in position 3, so R cannot be in 2 or 3.  
Thus R must be in 4 or 5. So R in 3 is disallowed.

Next: use EARLY is invalid.

Next: “EARLY” adjusted: put R in 4 or 5.

Try: “EAGER” – G allowed; positions: E1, A2, G3, E4, R5  
Check:
- E in 1: allowed.
- A in 2: allowed.
- G in 3: allowed.
- E in 4: allowed (only wrong in 2,5)
- R in 5: allowed (only wrong in 1,2,3)

This seems valid.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: REACT -> FEEDBACK: R(-) E(-) A(-) C(x) T(x)
Guess 3: BREAD -> FEEDBACK: B(x) R(-) E(-) A(-) D(x)
Guess 4: EAGER -> FEEDBACK: E(-) A(✓) G(x) E(✓) R(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the new feedback on EAGER:

E(-)  – E is in the word but not in position 1.  
A(✓)  – A is in the word AND in position 2.  
G(x)  – G is NOT in the word.  
E(✓)  – E is in the word AND in position 4.  
R(✓)  – R is in the word AND in position 5.

So we now know:

1. The word is _ A _ E R (positions 2,4,5 fixed as A, E, R).
2. Letters definitely not in the word: O, S, C, T, B, D, G.
3. We still need letters for positions 1 and 3 from the remaining alphabet (excluding the forbidden letters and the already-used A, E, R).

Remaining common consonants: F, H, I, K, L, M, N, P, U, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s pick a word that fits _ A _ E R and uses two new, plausible consonants for positions 1 and 3.

A good candidate is “F A I E R” but “FAIER” is not a valid English word.  
“H A I E R” → “HAIER” is invalid.  
“M A I E R” → “MAIER” is invalid.  
“L A I E R” → “LAIER” is invalid.  
“V A I E R” → “VAIER” is invalid.  
“N A I E R” → “NAIER” is invalid.  
“P A I E R” → “PAIER” is invalid.  
“K A I E R” → “KAIER” is invalid.  
“M A N E R” → “MANER” is invalid.  
“P A N E R” → “PANER” is invalid.  
“F A N E R” → “FANER” is invalid.  
“H A N E R” → “HANER” is invalid.  
“L A N E R” → “LANER” is invalid.  
“M A C E R” → C is forbidden.  
“L A G E R” → G is forbidden.  
“F A L E R” → “FALER” is invalid.  
“V A N E R” → “VANER” is invalid.  
“W A N E R” → “WANER” is invalid.  
“P A V E R” → “PAVER” is valid!

“PAVER” is a valid 5-letter English word: P, A, V, E, R.

Check constraints:
- P is allowed (not in forbidden list).  
- V is allowed.  
- A, E, R are already confirmed in positions 2,4,5.  
- No forbidden letters used.

Thus “PAVER” is a solid next guess.

From the latest feedback on PAVER:

P(x) – P is NOT in the word.  
A(✓) – A is in position 2 (already known).  
V(x) – V is NOT in the word.  
E(✓) – E is in position 4 (already known).  
R(✓) – R is in position 5 (already known).

So the pattern is still _ A _ E R, and we now know that P and V are not in the word (and we already knew O, S, C, T, B, D, G are out).

Forbidden letters so far: O, S, C, T, B, D, G, P, V.

Remaining common consonants for positions 1 and 3: F, H, I, K, L, M, N, W, Y, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that fits _ A _ E R and uses only allowed letters.

List of valid words that fit this pattern and check letters:

- F A K E R – “FAKER” is valid.  
  F and K are not forbidden.  
  This seems like the most straightforward valid word remaining.

Other options:
- H A N E R – “HANER” is invalid (not a common word).  
- M A N E R – “MANER” is invalid.  
- W A N E R – “WANER” is invalid.  
- F A I E R – “FAIER” is invalid.  
- L A I E R – “LAIER” is invalid.  
- M A I E R – “MAIER” is invalid.  
- F A L E R – “FALER” is invalid.  
- K A N E R – “KANER” is invalid.  
- F A K E R – valid and uses allowed letters.

Thus, “FAKER” is the best next guess.
