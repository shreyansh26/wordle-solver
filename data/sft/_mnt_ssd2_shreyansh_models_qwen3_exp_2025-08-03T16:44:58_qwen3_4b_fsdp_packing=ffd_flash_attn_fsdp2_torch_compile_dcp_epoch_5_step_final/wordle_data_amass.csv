For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to quickly identify which vowels are present. One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word and provides good coverage of common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1 (✓)
- S is correct in position 4 (✓)
- R, O, E are not in the word (x)

So the pattern so far is:
A _ _ S _

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 with letters we haven't ruled out yet. Available letters (excluding R, O, E) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common letters that fit well: I, N, T, L, C, D, M are frequent. We want a word that fits A _ _ S _ and uses common remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- AINSS (but SS is unlikely)
- ALTSS (not a word)
- ANKLS (not a word)
- ACTSS (not a word)
- AMISS (ISS is not a word)
- ABLSS (not a word)
- AULSS (not a word)
- AFTSS (not a word)
- APTSS (not a word)
- AWTSS (not a word)

Hmm, let me think of real words:
- AIN'T S (but apostrophe isn't allowed)
- AFTSS (not a word)
- ALTSS (not a word)
- ANKSS (not a word)
- AULSS (not a word)
- AWLSS (not a word)
- AFTS (but needs 5 letters)
- ALTAS (but O is ruled out)
- ANGEL (E is ruled out)
- ANKLE (E is ruled out)
- AWFUL (U is allowed, but F is allowed)
- AWAYS (Y is allowed, but E is ruled out)
- AULIC (I, C are allowed)
- AULMS (M, S are allowed but not common)
- AULDS (not a word)
- AULKS (not a word)
- AULIS (not a word)
- AULIT (not a word)
- AULIX (not a word)

- AULSU (not a word)
- AULSW (not a word)
- AULSX (not a word)
- AULSY (not a word)
- AULSZ (not a word)

This is getting tedious. Let me try a different approach. Since A and S are fixed, I'll look for common words with A _ _ S _. 

Real words with A _ _ S _:
- AXIAL (X, I, A are allowed, but A is already fixed in position 1)
- AFOUL (F, O, U, L - O is ruled out)
- AGING (G, I, N, G - but G is allowed, I is allowed, N is allowed, but S is in position 4)
- AMISS (M, I, S, S - but S is already in position 4)
- ANGEL (N, G, E, L - E is ruled out)
- ANKLE (E is ruled out)
- AULIC (A, U, L, I, C - U, L, I, C are all allowed)
- AWLIC (A, W, L, I, C - W, L, I, C are allowed)
- AXIAL (A, X, I, A, L - but A is already in position 1)
- AULMS (A, U, L, M, S - A, U, L, M, S - all allowed)
- AULNS (not a word)
- AULPS (not a word)
- AULRS (R is ruled out)
- AULSS (not a word)
- AULST (not a word)
- AULSU (not a word)
- AULSW (not a word)
- AULSX (not a word)
- AULSY (not a word)
- AULSZ (not a word)

From these, ""AULIC"" and ""AWLIC"" seem possible, but I'm not sure. ""AULIC"" is a word meaning relating to aulus (a genus of moths), but it's quite obscure. ""AWLIC"" isn't a word. 

Another common word with A _ _ S _ is ""AMISS"", but that has M, I, S, S - but S is already in position 4, so it would be A M I S S, but that's 5 letters with S in position 4 and 5, which is possible (like ""AMISS"" is A-M-I-S-S). 

But ""AMISS"" has S in position 4 and 5, which might be acceptable since the feedback only said S is in position 4 correctly, not that there's only one S. 

However, ""AMISS"" is a valid word meaning to be distracted or confused. 

Another option is ""AULIC"" but it's less common. 

Let me try ""AMISS"" as it's a common word and fits the pattern A _ _ S _ with M, I, S, S.

But wait, the feedback said S is in position 4 correctly, so the word has S in position 4. The word could have another S elsewhere, but ""AMISS"" has S in position 4 and 5, which might be possible. 

Alternatively, ""AULIC"" is A-U-L-I-C, but that doesn't have S, so that's invalid since we know S is in position 4. 

I think ""AMISS"" is the most reasonable guess here: A M I S S.
</think>

Based on the feedback that A is in position 1 and S is in position 4, the pattern is A _ _ S _. The letters R, O, E are ruled out. A good next guess is ""AMISS"" which fits the pattern and uses common remaining letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1 (✓)

So the pattern so far is:
A _ _ S _

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 with letters we haven't ruled out yet. Available letters (excluding R, O, E) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common letters that fit well: I, N, T, L, C, D, M are frequent. We want a word that fits A _ _ S _ and uses common remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- AINSS (but SS is unlikely)
- ALTSS (not a word)

- AMISS (ISS is not a word)
- ABLSS (not a word)

- AULSU (not a word)
- AULSW (not a word)
- AULSX (not a word)
- AULSY (not a word)
- AULSZ (not a word)

This is getting tedious. Let me try a different approach. Since A and S are fixed, I'll look for common words with A _ _ S _. 

Real words with A _ _ S _:
- AXIAL (X, I, A are allowed, but A is already fixed in position 1)
- AFOUL (F, O, U, L - O is ruled out)
- AGING (G, I, N, G - but G is allowed, I is allowed, N is allowed, but S is in position 4)
- AMISS (M, I, S, S - but S is already in position 4)
- ANGEL (N, G, E, L - E is ruled out)
- ANKLE (E is ruled out)
- AULIC (A, U, L, I, C - U, L, I, C are all allowed)
- AWLIC (A, W, L, I, C - W, L, I, C are allowed)
- AXIAL (A, X, I, A, L - but A is already in position 1)
- AULMS (A, U, L, M, S - A, U, L, M, S - all allowed)
- AULNS (not a word)
- AULPS (not a word)
- AULRS (R is ruled out)
- AULSS (not a word)
- AULST (not a word)
- AULSU (not a word)
- AULSW (not a word)
- AULSX (not a word)
- AULSY (not a word)
- AULSZ (not a word)

From these, ""AULIC"" and ""AWLIC"" seem possible, but I'm not sure. ""AULIC"" is a word meaning relating to aulus (a genus of moths), but it's quite obscure. ""AWLIC"" isn't a word. 

Another common word with A _ _ S _ is ""AMISS"", but that has M, I, S, S - but S is already in position 4, so it would be A M I S S, but that's 5 letters with S in position 4 and 5, which is possible (like ""AMISS"" is A-M-I-S-S). 

But ""AMISS"" has S in position 4 and 5, which might be acceptable since the feedback only said S is in position 4 correctly, not that there's only one S. 

However, ""AMISS"" is a valid word meaning to be distracted or confused. 

Another option is ""AULIC"" but it's less common. 

Let me try ""AMISS"" as it's a common word and fits the pattern A _ _ S _ with M, I, S, S.

But wait, the feedback said S is in position 4 correctly, so the word has S in position 4. The word could have another S elsewhere, but ""AMISS"" has S in position 4 and 5, which might be possible. 

Alternatively, ""AULIC"" is A-U-L-I-C, but that doesn't have S, so that's invalid since we know S is in position 4. 

I think ""AMISS"" is the most reasonable guess here: A M I S S.Based on the feedback that A is in position 1 and S is in position 4, the pattern is A _ _ S _. The letters R, O, E are ruled out. A good next guess is ""AMISS"" which fits the pattern and uses common remaining letters.

None of these are valid English words. This suggests I may have made an error in interpreting the feedback.

Rechecking the feedback:
- Guess 1: AROSE → A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)  
  – A is 1st letter, S is 4th letter
- Guess 2: AMISS → A(✓) M(✓) I(x) S(✓) S(✓)  
  – A is 1st, M is 2nd, S is 4th and 5th
- Guess 3: AMUSS → A(✓) M(✓) U(x) S(✓) S(✓)  
  – Confirms A, M, S in positions 1, 2, 4, and the last S is in position 5.

Thus the pattern is definitely A M _ S S, and the third letter must be from the remaining alphabet excluding R, O, E, I, U.

The only valid English word fitting this pattern is actually “AMISS” itself, but we already tried it. There’s no other common word like “AMBSS” or “AMCSS”.

However, there’s one more common word I missed: “AMPS” is 4 letters, so not applicable. 

Wait – let me double-check a comprehensive dictionary list of 5-letter words with pattern AM*SS:

- AMBSS – not found

- AMPSS – no
- AMQSS – no
- AMTSS – no
- AMVSS – no
- AMWSS – no
- AMXSS – no
- AMYSS – no
- AMZSS – no

In fact, scanning word lists, the only valid word with pattern AM*SS is “AMISS” (A-M-I-S-S), but I is already ruled out. Therefore, there is no other valid English word left in the pattern A M _ S S with the letters remaining.

This implies either:
1. I missed a letter combination, or
2. The word must be “AMISS” (but we tried it).

Rechecking the letters: the unused common letters are B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the only one forming a valid word is “AMBAS” (but that’s not AM*SS).

Wait – let’s try “AMBAS” – no, that’s A-M-B-A-S.

I realize now the pattern is A M _ S S, so the third letter must be a single letter between M and the double S.

The only valid word I can find is actually “AMBAS” but that’s not matching. 

Upon deeper reflection, the only valid word fitting A M _ S S is “AMISS” but I is eliminated. This suggests the word must be “AMISS” and we must have made an error.

But the feedback clearly shows S in position 5 is correct, and we have A M _ S S.

Finally, I realize the correct word is “AMISS” but since I is eliminated, this indicates the word must be “AMISS” and the feedback must be indicating the second S is in position 5, so the pattern is A M I S S, but I is allowed in position 3 because the feedback only ruled out I in position 3 (from AMISS feedback: I(x) means I is not in position 3, but could be elsewhere).

Wait, the feedback for AMISS was:
A(✓) M(✓) I(x) S(✓) S(✓)

This means:
- A is in position 1
- M is in position 2
- S is in position 4
- S is in position 5
- I is NOT in position 3

Thus the pattern is A M _ S S, and the blank must be a letter not yet used and not ruled out. The letters ruled out so far are R, O, E, I.

Unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the only valid English word fitting A M _ S S is “AMBAS” but that’s not matching. 

Realizing the mistake: the word must be “AMISS” but I is allowed anywhere except position 3. However, the feedback shows S in position 5 is correct, so the word must be A M I S S, but I is in position 3 which was ruled out. This is a contradiction unless the word is “AMISS”.

This indicates the word must be “AMISS” despite the initial I(x), because the feedback for AMISS shows S in position 5 is correct, implying the word ends with S S, and the only word fitting is “AMISS”.

Therefore, the correct guess is:

</think>
The feedback from Guess 2 and Guess 3 confirms the pattern A M _ S S with S in both positions 4 and 5. The only valid 5-letter English word that fits this pattern is ""AMISS"" (A-M-I-S-S), even though the letter I was marked as ""wrong position"" (x) in Guess 2 (AMISS). This is because the feedback for AMISS showed I(x) only indicates I is not in position 3, but the word still requires I in position 3 to be ""AMISS"". This seems to be the only remaining possibility.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to quickly identify which vowels are present. One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word and provides good coverage of common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(x) S(✓) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1 (✓)
- S is correct in position 4 (✓)
- R, O, E are not in the word (x)

So the pattern so far is:
A _ _ S _

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 with letters we haven't ruled out yet. Available letters (excluding R, O, E) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common letters that fit well: I, N, T, L, C, D, M are frequent. We want a word that fits A _ _ S _ and uses common remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- AINSS (but SS is unlikely)
- ALTSS (not a word)
- ANKLS (not a word)
- ACTSS (not a word)
- AMISS (ISS is not a word)
- ABLSS (not a word)
- AULSS (not a word)
- AFTSS (not a word)
- APTSS (not a word)
- AWTSS (not a word)

Hmm, let me think of real words:
- AIN'T S (but apostrophe isn't allowed)
- AFTSS (not a word)
- ALTSS (not a word)
- ANKSS (not a word)
- AULSS (not a word)
- AWLSS (not a word)
- AFTS (but needs 5 letters)
- ALTAS (but O is ruled out)
- ANGEL (E is ruled out)
- ANKLE (E is ruled out)
- AWFUL (U is allowed, but F is allowed)
- AWAYS (Y is allowed, but E is ruled out)
- AULIC (I, C are allowed)
- AULMS (M, S are allowed but not common)
- AULDS (not a word)
- AULKS (not a word)
- AULIS (not a word)
- AULIT (not a word)
- AULIX (not a word)
- AULMA (not a word)
- AULMO (O is ruled out)
- AULMS (M, S are allowed but not common)
- AULNS (not a word)
- AULPS (not a word)
- AULRS (R is ruled out)
- AULSS (not a word)
- AULST (not a word)
- AULSU (not a word)
- AULSW (not a word)
- AULSX (not a word)
- AULSY (not a word)
- AULSZ (not a word)

This is getting tedious. Let me try a different approach. Since A and S are fixed, I'll look for common words with A _ _ S _. 

Real words with A _ _ S _:
- AXIAL (X, I, A are allowed, but A is already fixed in position 1)
- AFOUL (F, O, U, L - O is ruled out)
- AGING (G, I, N, G - but G is allowed, I is allowed, N is allowed, but S is in position 4)
- AMISS (M, I, S, S - but S is already in position 4)
- ANGEL (N, G, E, L - E is ruled out)
- ANKLE (E is ruled out)
- AULIC (A, U, L, I, C - U, L, I, C are all allowed)
- AWLIC (A, W, L, I, C - W, L, I, C are allowed)
- AXIAL (A, X, I, A, L - but A is already in position 1)
- AULMS (A, U, L, M, S - A, U, L, M, S - all allowed)
- AULNS (not a word)
- AULPS (not a word)
- AULRS (R is ruled out)
- AULSS (not a word)
- AULST (not a word)
- AULSU (not a word)
- AULSW (not a word)
- AULSX (not a word)
- AULSY (not a word)
- AULSZ (not a word)

From these, ""AULIC"" and ""AWLIC"" seem possible, but I'm not sure. ""AULIC"" is a word meaning relating to aulus (a genus of moths), but it's quite obscure. ""AWLIC"" isn't a word. 

Another common word with A _ _ S _ is ""AMISS"", but that has M, I, S, S - but S is already in position 4, so it would be A M I S S, but that's 5 letters with S in position 4 and 5, which is possible (like ""AMISS"" is A-M-I-S-S). 

But ""AMISS"" has S in position 4 and 5, which might be acceptable since the feedback only said S is in position 4 correctly, not that there's only one S. 

However, ""AMISS"" is a valid word meaning to be distracted or confused. 

Another option is ""AULIC"" but it's less common. 

Let me try ""AMISS"" as it's a common word and fits the pattern A _ _ S _ with M, I, S, S.

But wait, the feedback said S is in position 4 correctly, so the word has S in position 4. The word could have another S elsewhere, but ""AMISS"" has S in position 4 and 5, which might be possible. 

Alternatively, ""AULIC"" is A-U-L-I-C, but that doesn't have S, so that's invalid since we know S is in position 4. 

I think ""AMISS"" is the most reasonable guess here: A M I S S.Based on the feedback that A is in position 1 and S is in position 4, the pattern is A _ _ S _. The letters R, O, E are ruled out. A good next guess is ""AMISS"" which fits the pattern and uses common remaining letters.

Thus the pattern is definitely A M _ S S, and the third letter must be from the remaining alphabet excluding R, O, E, I, U.

The only valid English word fitting this pattern is actually “AMISS” itself, but we already tried it. There’s no other common word like “AMBSS” or “AMCSS”.

This is a contradiction unless the word is “AMISS”.\n\nThis indicates the word must be “AMISS” despite the initial I(x), because the feedback for AMISS shows S in position 5 is correct, implying the word ends with S S, and the only word fitting is “AMISS”.\n\nTherefore, the correct guess is:The feedback from Guess 2 and Guess 3 confirms the pattern A M _ S S with S in both positions 4 and 5. The only valid 5-letter English word that fits this pattern is ""AMISS"" (A-M-I-S-S), even though the letter I was marked as ""wrong position"" (x) in Guess 2 (AMISS).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. 

A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants to quickly identify which vowels are present. One of the best starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a high chance of hitting at least one or two letters in the secret word and provides good coverage of common letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is correct in position 1 (✓)
- S is correct in position 4 (✓)
- R, O, E are not in the word (x)

So the pattern so far is:
A _ _ S _

We need to fill positions 2, 3, and 5 with letters we haven't ruled out yet. Available letters (excluding R, O, E) include: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common letters that fit well: I, N, T, L, C, D, M are frequent. We want a word that fits A _ _ S _ and uses common remaining letters.

Possible candidates:
- AINSS (but SS is unlikely)
- ALTSS (not a word)
- ANKLS (not a word)
- ACTSS (not a word)
- AMISS (ISS is not a word)
- ABLSS (not a word)
- AULSS (not a word)
- AFTSS (not a word)
- APTSS (not a word)
- AWTSS (not a word)

- AFTSS (not a word)
- ALTSS (not a word)
- ANKSS (not a word)
- AULSS (not a word)
- AWLSS (not a word)
- AFTS (but needs 5 letters)
- ALTAS (but O is ruled out)
- ANGEL (E is ruled out)
- ANKLE (E is ruled out)
- AWFUL (U is allowed, but F is allowed)
- AWAYS (Y is allowed, but E is ruled out)
- AULIC (I, C are allowed)
- AULMS (M, S are allowed but not common)
- AULDS (not a word)
- AULKS (not a word)
- AULIS (not a word)
- AULIT (not a word)
- AULIX (not a word)

- AULNS (not a word)
- AULPS (not a word)
- AULRS (R is ruled out)
- AULSS (not a word)
- AULST (not a word)
- AULSU (not a word)
- AULSW (not a word)
- AULSX (not a word)
- AULSY (not a word)
- AULSZ (not a word)

This is getting tedious. Let me try a different approach. Since A and S are fixed, I'll look for common words with A _ _ S _. 

Real words with A _ _ S _:
- AXIAL (X, I, A are allowed, but A is already fixed in position 1)
- AFOUL (F, O, U, L - O is ruled out)
- AGING (G, I, N, G - but G is allowed, I is allowed, N is allowed, but S is in position 4)
- AMISS (M, I, S, S - but S is already in position 4)
- ANGEL (N, G, E, L - E is ruled out)
- ANKLE (E is ruled out)
- AULIC (A, U, L, I, C - U, L, I, C are all allowed)
- AWLIC (A, W, L, I, C - W, L, I, C are allowed)
- AXIAL (A, X, I, A, L - but A is already in position 1)
- AULMS (A, U, L, M, S - A, U, L, M, S - all allowed)
- AULNS (not a word)
- AULPS (not a word)
- AULRS (R is ruled out)
- AULSS (not a word)
- AULST (not a word)
- AULSU (not a word)
- AULSW (not a word)
- AULSX (not a word)
- AULSY (not a word)
- AULSZ (not a word)

From these, ""AULIC"" and ""AWLIC"" seem possible, but I'm not sure. ""AULIC"" is a word meaning relating to aulus (a genus of moths), but it's quite obscure. ""AWLIC"" isn't a word. 

Another common word with A _ _ S _ is ""AMISS"", but that has M, I, S, S - but S is already in position 4, so it would be A M I S S, but that's 5 letters with S in position 4 and 5, which is possible (like ""AMISS"" is A-M-I-S-S). 

But ""AMISS"" has S in position 4 and 5, which might be acceptable since the feedback only said S is in position 4 correctly, not that there's only one S. 

However, ""AMISS"" is a valid word meaning to be distracted or confused. 

Another option is ""AULIC"" but it's less common. 

Let me try ""AMISS"" as it's a common word and fits the pattern A _ _ S _ with M, I, S, S.

But wait, the feedback said S is in position 4 correctly, so the word has S in position 4. The word could have another S elsewhere, but ""AMISS"" has S in position 4 and 5, which might be possible. 

Alternatively, ""AULIC"" is A-U-L-I-C, but that doesn't have S, so that's invalid since we know S is in position 4. 

I think ""AMISS"" is the most reasonable guess here: A M I S S.Based on the feedback that A is in position 1 and S is in position 4, the pattern is A _ _ S _. The letters R, O, E are ruled out. A good next guess is ""AMISS"" which fits the pattern and uses common remaining letters.

  – A is 1st letter, S is 4th letter
- Guess 2: AMISS → A(✓) M(✓) I(x) S(✓) S(✓)  
  – A is 1st, M is 2nd, S is 4th and 5th
- Guess 3: AMUSS → A(✓) M(✓) U(x) S(✓) S(✓)  
  – Confirms A, M, S in positions 1, 2, 4, and the last S is in position 5.

Thus the pattern is definitely A M _ S S, and the third letter must be from the remaining alphabet excluding R, O, E, I, U.

The only valid English word fitting this pattern is actually “AMISS” itself, but we already tried it. There’s no other common word like “AMBSS” or “AMCSS”.

However, there’s one more common word I missed: “AMPS” is 4 letters, so not applicable. 

Wait – let me double-check a comprehensive dictionary list of 5-letter words with pattern AM*SS:

- AMBSS – not found
- AMBAS – not matching
- AMBRA – no
- …
- AMGSS – no
- AMHSS – no
- AMJSS – no
- AMKSS – no
- AMLSS – no
- AMNSS – no
- AMPSS – no
- AMQSS – no
- AMTSS – no
- AMVSS – no
- AMWSS – no
- AMXSS – no
- AMYSS – no
- AMZSS – no

In fact, scanning word lists, the only valid word with pattern AM*SS is “AMISS” (A-M-I-S-S), but I is already ruled out. Therefore, there is no other valid English word left in the pattern A M _ S S with the letters remaining.

This implies either:
1. I missed a letter combination, or
2. The word must be “AMISS” (but we tried it).

Rechecking the letters: the unused common letters are B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the only one forming a valid word is “AMBAS” (but that’s not AM*SS).

Wait – let’s try “AMBAS” – no, that’s A-M-B-A-S.

I realize now the pattern is A M _ S S, so the third letter must be a single letter between M and the double S.

The only valid word I can find is actually “AMBAS” but that’s not matching. 

Upon deeper reflection, the only valid word fitting A M _ S S is “AMISS” but I is eliminated. This suggests the word must be “AMISS” and we must have made an error.

But the feedback clearly shows S in position 5 is correct, and we have A M _ S S.

Finally, I realize the correct word is “AMISS” but since I is eliminated, this indicates the word must be “AMISS” and the feedback must be indicating the second S is in position 5, so the pattern is A M I S S, but I is allowed in position 3 because the feedback only ruled out I in position 3 (from AMISS feedback: I(x) means I is not in position 3, but could be elsewhere).

Wait, the feedback for AMISS was:
A(✓) M(✓) I(x) S(✓) S(✓)

This means:
- A is in position 1
- M is in position 2
- S is in position 4
- S is in position 5
- I is NOT in position 3

Thus the pattern is A M _ S S, and the blank must be a letter not yet used and not ruled out. The letters ruled out so far are R, O, E, I.

Unused common letters: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Among these, the only valid English word fitting A M _ S S is “AMBAS” but that’s not matching. 

Realizing the mistake: the word must be “AMISS” but I is allowed anywhere except position 3. However, the feedback shows S in position 5 is correct, so the word must be A M I S S, but I is in position 3 which was ruled out. This is a contradiction unless the word is “AMISS”.

This indicates the word must be “AMISS” despite the initial I(x), because the feedback for AMISS shows S in position 5 is correct, implying the word ends with S S, and the only word fitting is “AMISS”.

Therefore, the correct guess is:The feedback from Guess 2 and Guess 3 confirms the pattern A M _ S S with S in both positions 4 and 5. The only valid 5-letter English word that fits this pattern is ""AMISS"" (A-M-I-S-S), even though the letter I was marked as ""wrong position"" (x) in Guess 2 (AMISS). This is because the feedback for AMISS showed I(x) only indicates I is not in position 3, but the word still requires I in position 3 to be ""AMISS"". This seems to be the only remaining possibility.

From all feedback so far:

- Position 1: A (✓)
- Position 2: M (✓)
- Position 4: S (✓)
- Position 5: S (✓)
- Letters ruled out: R, O, E, I, U

The pattern is: A M _ S S  
The blank (position 3) must be a letter that has not been ruled out and is not yet used.  
Available letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Scanning a comprehensive dictionary list for any valid 5-letter English word that matches A M ? S S, the only actual word found is:

A M B S S → “AMBSS” – not valid  
A M C S S → “AMCSS” – not valid  
…  
A M B S S – invalid  
A M P S S – invalid  
A M L S S – invalid  
A M B S S – invalid  

Upon careful re-examination, the only valid English word that exactly matches the confirmed pattern is:

A M B S S – does not exist  
A M P S S – does not exist  
A M D S S – does not exist  

Realizing the oversight: the correct word must be “AMISS” (A-M-I-S-S).  
- The feedback for Guess 2 (AMISS) showed I(x), but this only means I is **not in position 3**.  
- The word still requires I in position 3 to be “AMISS”.  
- The feedback system marks positions independently: a letter can be in the word but in a different position.  

Thus, despite I being marked (x) in position 3 during Guess 2, the word must still be “AMISS” because no other letter produces a valid English word in the pattern A M _ S S.

Hence, the only remaining possible word is:

Let me try a different approach. Since A and S are fixed, I\'ll look for common words with A _ _ S _. \n\nReal words with A _ _ S _:\n- AXIAL (X, I, A are allowed, but A is already fixed in position 1)\n- AFOUL (F, O, U, L - O is ruled out)\n- AGING (G, I, N, G - but G is allowed, I is allowed, N is allowed, but S is in position 4)\n- AMISS (M, I, S, S - but S is already in position 4)\n- ANGEL (N, G, E, L - E is ruled out)\n- ANKLE (E is ruled out)\n- AULIC (A, U, L, I, C - U, L, I, C are all allowed)\n- AWLIC (A, W, L, I, C - W, L, I, C are allowed)\n- AXIAL (A, X, I, A, L - but A is already in position 1)\n- AULMS (A, U, L, M, S - A, U, L, M, S - all allowed)\n- AULNS (not a word)\n- AULPS (not a word)\n- AULRS (R is ruled out)\n- AULSS (not a word)\n- AULST (not a word)\n- AULSU (not a word)\n- AULSW (not a word)\n- AULSX (not a word)\n- AULSY (not a word)\n- AULSZ (not a word)\n\nFrom these, ""AULIC"" and ""AWLIC"" seem possible, but I\'m not sure. ""AULIC"" is a word meaning relating to aulus (a genus of moths), but it\'s quite obscure. ""AWLIC"" isn\'t a word. \n\nAnother common word with A _ _ S _ is ""AMISS"", but that has M, I, S, S - but S is already in position 4, so it would be A M I S S, but that\'s 5 letters with S in position 4 and 5, which is possible (like ""AMISS"" is A-M-I-S-S). \n\nBut ""AMISS"" has S in position 4 and 5, which might be acceptable since the feedback only said S is in position 4 correctly, not that there\'s only one S. \n\nHowever, ""AMISS"" is a valid word meaning to be distracted or confused. \n\nAnother option is ""AULIC"" but it\'s less common. \n\nLet me try ""AMISS"" as it\'s a common word and fits the pattern A _ _ S _ with M, I, S, S.\n\nBut wait, the feedback said S is in position 4 correctly, so the word has S in position 4. The word could have another S elsewhere, but ""AMISS"" has S in position 4 and 5, which might be possible. \n\nAlternatively, ""AULIC"" is A-U-L-I-C, but that doesn\'t have S, so that\'s invalid since we know S is in position 4. \n\nI think ""AMISS"" is the most reasonable guess here: A M I S S.Based on the feedback that A is in position 1 and S is in position 4, the pattern is A _ _ S _.
