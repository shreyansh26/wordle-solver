Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to make a strategic choice. A good first guess should:
1. Include common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize the information gained
3. Cover a broad range of possible letters

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good mix would include several of these.

A strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 5 unique letters
- It includes very common letters: A, R, O, S, E
- These letters can help quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions

This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- A is in the word but in the wrong place.
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong place.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S (each once) and does not contain R, O, E.
- A cannot be in position 1 (it was first in position 1 and marked “-”).
- S cannot be in position 4 (it was first in position 4 and marked “-”).

We still need to test positions for A and S, and we need to find the other three letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, O, E). Good remaining letters to test include T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, etc.

A smart next guess would:
1. Keep A and S but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce three new high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s try “STAIN”:
- S is now in position 1 (new position for S).
- T, I, N are new letters not yet eliminated.
- A is now in position 3 (new position for A).
This tests new positions for A and S while adding T, I, N to the mix.

However, let’s double-check: the feedback said S is in the word but in the wrong place, and in “arose” S was in position 4. So S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, A could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it was in position 1 and marked “-”).

Another candidate is “SALTY”:
- S in position 1 (new for S).
- A in position 2 (new for A).
- L, T, Y are new letters.

But Y is less common as a vowel substitute. Let’s stick with “STAIN”.

Yet, let’s consider that we want to maximize information. Instead of “STAIN”, maybe “SALTY” is better because:
- S in 1, A in 2 (both new positions).
- L, T, Y are all new letters.

But let’s check another angle: the letters not yet used and not yet eliminated are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Among these, high-frequency ones are C, D, I, L, N, T, Y.

Let’s try “SALTY” as it introduces four new letters (S and A are already known to be in the word, so we need three more). Actually, “SALTY” has S, A, L, T, Y – but S and A are already confirmed, so we’re adding L, T, Y. This seems good.

But let’s also ensure that we’re not repeating any positions. Since A was in position 1 (wrong), and S was in position 4 (wrong), we can safely put them in new positions.

Let’s go with “SALTY”:
- S in position 1 (new for S).
- A in position 2 (new for A).
- L, T, Y are new letters.

However, let’s double-check: the feedback said S is in the word but in the wrong place, and in “arose” S was in position 4. So S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, A could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it was in position 1 and marked “-”).

Another good candidate is “SALTY” because it tests S in position 1 and A in position 2, which are both acceptable given the constraints.

Let’s confirm: “SALTY” is a valid 5-letter word, and it meets all constraints:
- Contains S and A (known to be in word), and does not contain R, O, E.
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so acceptable).
- A is in position 2 (not 1, so acceptable).
- L, T, Y are new letters.

Therefore, “SALTY” is a solid next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to make a strategic choice. A good first guess should:
1. Include common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize the information gained
3. Cover a broad range of possible letters

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good mix would include several of these.

A strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 5 unique letters
- It includes very common letters: A, R, O, S, E
- These letters can help quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions

This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- A is in the word but in the wrong place.
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong place.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S (each once) and does not contain R, O, E.
- A cannot be in position 1 (it was first in position 1 and marked “-”).
- S cannot be in position 4 (it was first in position 4 and marked “-”).

We still need to test positions for A and S, and we need to find the other three letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, O, E). Good remaining letters to test include T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, etc.

A smart next guess would:
1. Keep A and S but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce three new high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s try “STAIN”:
- S is now in position 1 (new position for S).
- T, I, N are new letters not yet eliminated.
- A is now in position 3 (new position for A).
This tests new positions for A and S while adding T, I, N to the mix.

However, let’s double-check: the feedback said S is in the word but in the wrong place, and in “arose” S was in position 4. So S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, A could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it was in position 1 and marked “-”).

Another candidate is “SALTY”:
- S in position 1 (new for S).
- A in position 2 (new for A).
- L, T, Y are new letters.

But Y is less common as a vowel substitute. Let’s stick with “STAIN”.

Yet, let’s consider that we want to maximize information. Instead of “STAIN”, maybe “SALTY” is better because:
- S in 1, A in 2 (both new positions).
- L, T, Y are all new letters.

But let’s check another angle: the letters not yet used and not yet eliminated are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Among these, high-frequency ones are C, D, I, L, N, T, Y.

Let’s try “SALTY” as it introduces four new letters (S and A are already known to be in the word, so we need three more). Actually, “SALTY” has S, A, L, T, Y – but S and A are already confirmed, so we’re adding L, T, Y. This seems good.

But let’s also ensure that we’re not repeating any positions. Since A was in position 1 (wrong), and S was in position 4 (wrong), we can safely put them in new positions.

Let’s go with “SALTY”:
- S in position 1 (new for S).
- A in position 2 (new for A).
- L, T, Y are new letters.

However, let’s double-check: the feedback said S is in the word but in the wrong place, and in “arose” S was in position 4. So S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, A could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it was in position 1 and marked “-”).

Another good candidate is “SALTY” because it tests S in position 1 and A in position 2, which are both acceptable given the constraints.

Let’s confirm: “SALTY” is a valid 5-letter word, and it meets all constraints:
- Contains S and A (known to be in word), and does not contain R, O, E.
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so acceptable).
- A is in position 2 (not 1, so acceptable).
- L, T, Y are new letters.

Therefore, “SALTY” is a solid next guess.

Step 1 – Extract what we now know  
- S is locked in position 1.  
- L is locked in position 3.  
- Y is locked in position 5.  
- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because in Guess 2 it was marked “✓” in position 2, so we must move it).  
- C and T are not in the word.  
- Letters already placed: S, L, Y.  
- Letters already known to be in the word: A (must appear somewhere other than position 2).  
- Letters still available (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, etc.

Step 2 – Build the pattern  
Word shape: S _ L _ Y  
We know A must appear somewhere in the remaining two blanks (positions 2 or 4), but position 2 is not allowed for A (from Guess 2 feedback). Therefore A must be in position 4.  
So the word must be: S _ L A Y.

Step 3 – Determine the missing letter (position 2)  
We need a single letter that hasn’t been ruled out and forms a valid word.  
Letters ruled out so far: R, O, E, T, C.  
A valid word that fits S _ L A Y is SMALL.  
Check:  
- S M L A Y – all letters allowed and not yet eliminated.  
- M hasn’t been tested yet.  

Therefore, the next guess is SMALL.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, I need to make a strategic choice. A good first guess should:
1. Include common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words
2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize the information gained
3. Cover a broad range of possible letters

Looking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good mix would include several of these.

A strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:
- It contains 5 unique letters
- It includes very common letters: A, R, O, S, E
- These letters can help quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions

This should give us good coverage for the first guess.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose” we now know:

- A is in the word but in the wrong place.
- R, O, E are not in the word at all.
- S is in the word but in the wrong place.

So the secret word:
- Contains A and S (each once) and does not contain R, O, E.
- A cannot be in position 1 (it was first in position 1 and marked “-”).
- S cannot be in position 4 (it was first in position 4 and marked “-”).

We still need to test positions for A and S, and we need to find the other three letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, O, E). Good remaining letters to test include T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, etc.

A smart next guess would:
1. Keep A and S but move them to new positions.
2. Introduce three new high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested yet.

Let’s try “STAIN”:
- S is now in position 1 (new position for S).
- T, I, N are new letters not yet eliminated.
- A is now in position 3 (new position for A).
This tests new positions for A and S while adding T, I, N to the mix.

However, let’s double-check: the feedback said S is in the word but in the wrong place, and in “arose” S was in position 4. So S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, A could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it was in position 1 and marked “-”).

Another candidate is “SALTY”:
- S in position 1 (new for S).
- A in position 2 (new for A).
- L, T, Y are new letters.

But Y is less common as a vowel substitute. Let’s stick with “STAIN”.

Yet, let’s consider that we want to maximize information. Instead of “STAIN”, maybe “SALTY” is better because:
- S in 1, A in 2 (both new positions).
- L, T, Y are all new letters.

But let’s check another angle: the letters not yet used and not yet eliminated are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Among these, high-frequency ones are C, D, I, L, N, T, Y.

Let’s try “SALTY” as it introduces four new letters (S and A are already known to be in the word, so we need three more). Actually, “SALTY” has S, A, L, T, Y – but S and A are already confirmed, so we’re adding L, T, Y. This seems good.

But let’s also ensure that we’re not repeating any positions. Since A was in position 1 (wrong), and S was in position 4 (wrong), we can safely put them in new positions.

Let’s go with “SALTY”:
- S in position 1 (new for S).
- A in position 2 (new for A).
- L, T, Y are new letters.

However, let’s double-check: the feedback said S is in the word but in the wrong place, and in “arose” S was in position 4. So S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, A could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it was in position 1 and marked “-”).

Another good candidate is “SALTY” because it tests S in position 1 and A in position 2, which are both acceptable given the constraints.

Let’s confirm: “SALTY” is a valid 5-letter word, and it meets all constraints:
- Contains S and A (known to be in word), and does not contain R, O, E.
- S is in position 1 (not 4, so acceptable).
- A is in position 2 (not 1, so acceptable).
- L, T, Y are new letters.

Therefore, “SALTY” is a solid next guess.

- A is in the correct position (position 2).
- L is in the correct position (position 3).
- Y is in the correct position (position 5).
- T is NOT in the word at all.

So the secret word looks like: S A L _ Y

Letters already used: S, A, L, Y  

Remaining possible letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, etc.

- SCALY  
- SLALY (not a real word)  
- SLUMY (not common)  
- SLIMY  
- SLANK (not a word)  
- SCALY is the most obvious real word.

Let’s check:  
- S A L C Y → all letters are allowed and not yet eliminated.  
- C hasn’t been tested yet, so it’s a valid candidate.

Therefore, the next guess should be SCALY.

- Letters already known to be in the word: A (must appear somewhere other than position 2).  
- Letters still available (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, etc.

Step 2 – Build the pattern  
Word shape: S _ L _ Y  
We know A must appear somewhere in the remaining two blanks (positions 2 or 4), but position 2 is not allowed for A (from Guess 2 feedback). Therefore A must be in position 4.  
So the word must be: S _ L A Y.

Step 3 – Determine the missing letter (position 2)  
We need a single letter that hasn’t been ruled out and forms a valid word.  
Letters ruled out so far: R, O, E, T, C.  
A valid word that fits S _ L A Y is SMALL.  
Check:  
- S M L A Y – all letters allowed and not yet eliminated.

A good first guess should:\n1. Include common letters that appear frequently in 5-letter words\n2. Avoid repeating letters to maximize the information gained\n3. Cover a broad range of possible letters\n\nLooking at letter frequency in English, the most common letters are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good mix would include several of these.\n\nA strong candidate is ""AROSE"" because:\n- It contains 5 unique letters\n- It includes very common letters: A, R, O, S, E\n- These letters can help quickly identify which letters are in the word and their positions\n\nThis should give us good coverage for the first guess.\n\n<guess>arose</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the feedback on “arose” we now know:\n\n- A is in the word but in the wrong place.\n- R, O, E are not in the word at all.\n- S is in the word but in the wrong place.\n\nSo the secret word:\n- Contains A and S (each once) and does not contain R, O, E.\n- A cannot be in position 1 (it was first in position 1 and marked “-”).\n- S cannot be in position 4 (it was first in position 4 and marked “-”).\n\nWe still need to test positions for A and S, and we need to find the other three letters from the remaining alphabet (excluding R, O, E). Good remaining letters to test include T, L, N, I, C, U, D, M, etc.\n\nA smart next guess would:\n1. Keep A and S but move them to new positions.\n2. Introduce three new high-frequency letters that haven’t been tested yet.\n\nLet’s try “STAIN”:\n- S is now in position 1 (new position for S).\n- T, I, N are new letters not yet eliminated.\n- A is now in position 3 (new position for A).\nThis tests new positions for A and S while adding T, I, N to the mix.\n\nHowever, let’s double-check: the feedback said S is in the word but in the wrong place, and in “arose” S was in position 4. So S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, A could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it was in position 1 and marked “-”).\n\nAnother candidate is “SALTY”:\n- S in position 1 (new for S).\n- A in position 2 (new for A).\n- L, T, Y are new letters.\n\nBut Y is less common as a vowel substitute. Let’s stick with “STAIN”.\n\nYet, let’s consider that we want to maximize information. Instead of “STAIN”, maybe “SALTY” is better because:\n- S in 1, A in 2 (both new positions).\n- L, T, Y are all new letters.\n\nBut let’s check another angle: the letters not yet used and not yet eliminated are: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Among these, high-frequency ones are C, D, I, L, N, T, Y.\n\nLet’s try “SALTY” as it introduces four new letters (S and A are already known to be in the word, so we need three more). Actually, “SALTY” has S, A, L, T, Y – but S and A are already confirmed, so we’re adding L, T, Y. This seems good.\n\nBut let’s also ensure that we’re not repeating any positions. Since A was in position 1 (wrong), and S was in position 4 (wrong), we can safely put them in new positions.\n\nLet’s go with “SALTY”:\n- S in position 1 (new for S).\n- A in position 2 (new for A).\n- L, T, Y are new letters.\n\nHowever, let’s double-check: the feedback said S is in the word but in the wrong place, and in “arose” S was in position 4. So S could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5. Similarly, A could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (since it was in position 1 and marked “-”).\n\nAnother good candidate is “SALTY” because it tests S in position 1 and A in position 2, which are both acceptable given the constraints.\n\nLet’s confirm: “SALTY” is a valid 5-letter word, and it meets all constraints:\n- Contains S and A (known to be in word), and does not contain R, O, E.\n- S is in position 1 (not 4, so acceptable).\n- A is in position 2 (not 1, so acceptable).\n- L, T, Y are new letters.\n\nTherefore, “SALTY” is a solid next guess.\n\n<guess>salty</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) T(x) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'From the new feedback on “salty” we now know:\n\n- S is in the correct position (position 1).\n- A is in the correct position (position 2).\n- L is in the correct position (position 3).\n- Y is in the correct position (position 5).\n- T is NOT in the word at all.\n\nSo the secret word looks like: S A L _ Y\n\nWe just need to determine the 4th letter.  \nLetters already ruled out: R, O, E, T  \nLetters already used: S, A, L, Y  \n\nRemaining possible letters (common ones): B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, etc.\n\nCommon 5-letter words that fit S A L _ Y:\n- SCALY  \n- SLALY (not a real word)  \n- SLUMY (not common)  \n- SLIMY  \n- SLANK (not a word)  \n- SCALY is the most obvious real word.\n\nLet’s check:  \n- S A L C Y → all letters are allowed and not yet eliminated.  \n- C hasn’t been tested yet, so it’s a valid candidate.\n\nTherefore, the next guess should be SCALY.\n\n<guess>scaly</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(x) O(x) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: salty -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) T(x) Y(✓)\nGuess 3: scaly -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) C(x) A(-) L(✓) Y(✓)\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Step 1 – Extract what we now know  \n- S is locked in position 1.  \n- L is locked in position 3.  \n- Y is locked in position 5.  \n- A is in the word but NOT in position 2 (because in Guess 2 it was marked “✓” in position 2, so we must move it).  \n- C and T are not in the word.  \n- Letters already placed: S, L, Y.  \n- Letters already known to be in the word: A (must appear somewhere other than position 2).  \n- Letters still available (common ones): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, M, N, P, U, V, W, etc.\n\nStep 2 – Build the pattern  \nWord shape: S _ L _ Y  \nWe know A must appear somewhere in the remaining two blanks (positions 2 or 4), but position 2 is not allowed for A (from Guess 2 feedback).

Let’s summarize the constraints after five guesses:

1. Letters fixed by ✓ feedback:
   - S in position 1
   - L in position 3
   - Y in position 5

2. Letters known to be in the word but whose exact positions are still uncertain:
   - A (from arose, salty, scaly, small, splay: in every case, A is marked “-” except when it should have been “✓”)

   Wait: re-examining the feedback:
   - Guess 1 arose → A(-) … so A is in the word but not in position 1.
   - Guess 2 salty → A(✓) in position 2.  That would lock A in position 2.
   - Guess 3 scaly → A(-) … which would contradict that unless I misread.

   Let me re-examine carefully:

   Guess 2: salty → S(✓) A(✓) L(✓) T(x) Y(✓)  →  A is ✓ in position 2 → so A must be in position 2.

   Guess 3: scaly → S(✓) C(x) A(-) L(✓) Y(✓) → A is now (-) in position 3, but we already have A locked in position 2 from Guess 2.  This is impossible unless I misread.

   Actually, the feedback for Guess 3 is:
   - S(✓)  → position 1 fixed
   - C(x)  → C not in word
   - A(-)  → A is in word but NOT in position 3 (it is already fixed in position 2)
   - L(✓)  → position 3 fixed (L)
   - Y(✓)  → position 5 fixed (Y)

   So the word shape is:
   S A L _ Y

   And the only unknown is position 4.

   Letters already ruled out: R, O, E, T, C, M, P.

   Possible letters for position 4 (common, not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, N, U, V, W, etc.

   Real 5-letter words that fit S A L _ Y:
   - S A L B Y  – not a word
   - S A L D Y  – not a word
   - S A L F Y  – not a word
   - S A L G Y  – not a word
   - S A L H Y  – not a word
   - S A L I Y  – not a word
   - S A L K Y  – not a word
   - S A L N Y  – not a word
   - S A L U Y  – not a word
   - S A L V Y  – not a word
   - S A L W Y  – not a word

   The only real word left is S A L V Y (but that’s not valid).  Actually, the correct word is S A L V Y → not valid.

   Wait, let me double-check: is there any valid English word that is S A L _ Y?

   Yes: S A L V Y is not a word, but S A L V Y → no.

   Actually, the valid word is S A L V Y → not found.

   Let me check again: is S A L V Y valid?  No.

   Another candidate: S A L L Y → but L is already in position 3.

   The only valid word that fits is S A L L Y, but that would have L in position 4, and we already have L in position 3.  But the word cannot have two L’s (since letters are typically unique in such puzzles unless stated otherwise).

   Therefore, the only remaining possibility is S A L L Y, but that would have L in position 4, and we already have L in position 3.  That would be a valid word (as in the game “Sally”), but let’s check if L has been ruled out.

   L is in position 3 and marked ✓, so it is allowed to appear again.  Therefore, the word could be S A L L Y.

   Let me confirm: S A L L Y is a valid 5-letter word.

   So the next guess is S A L L Y.
