For my first guess, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help me quickly identify which letters might be in the secret word. A good strategy is to use a word with frequently occurring letters in English, such as vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and common consonants (R, S, T, L, N, etc.).

Looking at common 5-letter words, ""AROSE"" is an excellent choice because it contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 very common consonants (R, S). This will give us good coverage to determine which letters are present in the secret word and their possible positions.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-) → A is in the word but in the wrong position (not first)
- R(-) → R is in the word but in the wrong position (not second)
- O, S, E → all absent

So the secret word:
- contains A and R somewhere (but not in positions 1 or 2 respectively)
- does not contain O, S, or E
- must be 5 letters

I need a word that:
1. has A and R
2. doesn’t use O, S, or E
3. places A not in position 1 and R not in position 2

Good candidate letters left: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

A useful next guess should test new common consonants and possible positions for A and R. ""TRAIN"" fits:
- contains A and R
- uses T, I, N which haven’t been tested
- places A in position 2 and R in position 4 (both positions are new)

This will help narrow down the possible positions for A and R and test new consonants.

Let's update the constraints from all feedback:

1. A is in the word and must be in position 3 (✓ in guess 2).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from guess 2 and 3).
3. T is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from guess 2 and 3).
4. Letters definitely absent: O, S, E, I, N, B, Y.
5. Current pattern: _ _ A _ _

Possible positions left for R: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions left for T: 3, 4, 5 (but A is already in 3), so T can be in 4 or 5

We need a word with:
- A in position 3
- R in 1, 4, or 5
- T in 4 or 5
- No O, S, E, I, N, B, Y
- Other letters must be from remaining: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Let's list possible combinations:
- If R is in position 1: R _ A _ _
  - T must be in 4 or 5
  - Possible: R A A _ _ (invalid), R _ A T _, R _ A _ T
  - Valid words: RAKET (but E is out), RATCH (invalid), RAPID (I is out), RAVET (invalid), RAKED (E out), etc. None seem valid.

- If R is in position 4: _ _ A R _
  - T must be in 5
  - Pattern: _ _ A R T
  - Possible letters for first two positions: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
  - Valid words: CRART (invalid), DRART (invalid), FRART (invalid), GRART (invalid), HRART (invalid), etc. None valid.

- If R is in position 5: _ _ A _ R
  - T must be in 4
  - Pattern: _ _ A T R
  - Possible first two letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
  - Valid words: CATTY (Y out), DATTY (Y out), FATTY (Y out), etc. None valid.

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Let me reconsider:

Wait, in guess 3 (bartY), the feedback was:
B(x) A(-) R(-) T(-) Y(x)
This means:
- B and Y are not in the word
- A is in word but wrong position (but we have ✓ in guess 2 that A is in position 3, so this must be correct)
- R is in word but wrong position (from guess 3, it's not in position 3, which we already knew)
- T is in word but wrong position (from guess 3, it's not in position 4)

So updated constraints:
- A is fixed in position 3
- R is in word, not in positions 2 or 3
- T is in word, not in positions 1, 2, or 4
- Letters out: O, S, E, I, N, B, Y
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _

Now positions:
- R can be in 1 or 5 (since 2,3 are out)
- T must be in 5 (since 1,2,4 are out, and 3 is A)
- So T is in 5, R must be in 1 or 5, but T is in 5, so R must be in 1

Thus the word must be: R _ A _ T

Now fill positions 2 and 4 from remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible valid words:
- RADGT (invalid)
- RAMAT (invalid)
- RAPAT (invalid)
- RAKAT (invalid)
- RAVAT (invalid)
- RUFAT (invalid)
- RULAT (invalid)
- RUMAT (invalid)
- RUPAT (invalid)

None of these are valid. Let me think differently - maybe T is in 3, but A is in 3. No.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me re-examine:

From guess 3:
- T is in word but wrong position (not 4)
From guess 2:
- T is in word but wrong position (not 2)
From guess 1:
- T is not in arose feedback, so not in 1

So T must be in 3 or 5, but A is in 3, so T must be in 5.

Thus:
_ _ A _ T

R must be in 1 or 5, but 5 is T, so R must be in 1:

R _ A _ T

Now position 2 and 4 must be filled with letters not used yet (C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z)

Looking for valid 5-letter words:
- RACUT (invalid)
- RADUT (invalid)
- RAGUT (invalid)
- RAHUT (invalid)
- RAKUT (invalid)
- RAMUT (invalid)
- RAPUT (invalid)
- RAQUT (invalid)
- RAVUT (invalid)
- RAWUT (invalid)
- RAXUT (invalid)
- RAZUT (invalid)

Hmm, none. Maybe position 4 can be U?

- RACUT - no
- RADUT - no
- RAGUT - no
- RAHUT - no
- RIKUT - no
- RUMT - too short
- RAPUT - no

Wait, let me try:
- RAKUT - no
- RAVT - no
- RAPT - no
- RAKT - no

This seems problematic. Maybe I made an error in assuming R must be in 1. Let me re-examine:

From guess 3 (bartY):
- R(-) means R is in word but not in position 3 (which we already knew)
From guess 2 (train):
- R(-) means R is in word but not in position 2
Thus R can be in 1, 4, or 5

From guess 3:
- T(-) means T is in word but not in position 4
From guess 2:
- T(-) means T is in word but not in position 2
From guess 1:
- T not present in arose
Thus T can be in 1, 3, or 5, but:
- 1: not ruled out
- 3: A is here
- 5: possible

Thus T must be in 1 or 5

Let's consider both cases:

Case 1: T in 1
Pattern: T _ A _ _
R must be in 4 or 5 (since 2,3 are out)
Letters out: O, S, E, I, N, B, Y
Remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible:
- T R A _ _ (invalid, R would be in 2 which is out)
- T _ A R _
  - T _ A R _
  - Position 2 and 5 must be filled with remaining letters
  - Valid words: T C A R _ (need 5th letter)
  - T C A R D - T C A R D is invalid
  - T C A R G - invalid
  - T C A R M - invalid
  - T C A R P - invalid
  - T C A R U - invalid
  - T C A R V - invalid
  - T C A R Z - invalid
  - T F A R _ - similar issues
  - T H A R _ - T H A R D - invalid
  - T H A R P - invalid
  - T H A R K - invalid
  - T H A R V - invalid
  - T H A R M - invalid
  - T L A R _ - no
  - T M A R _ - T M A R K - invalid
  - T P A R _ - T P A R K - invalid
  - T V A R _ - invalid
  - T W A R _ - invalid

Case 2: T in 5
Pattern: _ _ A _ T
R must be in 1, 4 (but 4 would be T's position if R is in 4, but T is in 5)
Wait:
- R can be in 1 or 4 (since 2,3,5 are out for R from previous feedback)
From guess 3 (bartY):
- R(-) means not in position 3 (already)
- From guess 2 (train):
- R(-) means not in position 2
Thus R can be in 1, 4, or 5
But T is in 5, so R must be in 1 or 4

Thus:

Thus, the next guess should be ""CHART"".

<guess>chart</guess>",chart,"Let's update the constraints from all feedback:

1. A is in the word and must be in position 3 (✓ in guess 2).
2. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2 or 3 (from guess 2 and 3).
3. T is in the word but NOT in positions 1 or 2 (from guess 2 and 3).
4. Letters definitely absent: O, S, E, I, N, B, Y.
5. Current pattern: _ _ A _ _

Possible positions left for R: 1, 4, 5
Possible positions left for T: 3, 4, 5 (but A is already in 3), so T can be in 4 or 5

We need a word with:
- A in position 3
- R in 1, 4, or 5
- T in 4 or 5
- No O, S, E, I, N, B, Y
- Other letters must be from remaining: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Let's list possible combinations:
- If R is in position 1: R _ A _ _
  - T must be in 4 or 5
  - Possible: R A A _ _ (invalid), R _ A T _, R _ A _ T
  - Valid words: RAKET (but E is out), RATCH (invalid), RAPID (I is out), RAVET (invalid), RAKED (E out), etc. None seem valid.

- If R is in position 4: _ _ A R _
  - T must be in 5
  - Pattern: _ _ A R T
  - Possible letters for first two positions: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z
  - Valid words: CRART (invalid), DRART (invalid), FRART (invalid), GRART (invalid), HRART (invalid), etc. None valid.

- If R is in position 5: _ _ A _ R

  - Valid words: CATTY (Y out), DATTY (Y out), FATTY (Y out), etc. None valid.

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Let me reconsider:

Wait, in guess 3 (bartY), the feedback was:
B(x) A(-) R(-) T(-) Y(x)
This means:
- B and Y are not in the word
- A is in word but wrong position (but we have ✓ in guess 2 that A is in position 3, so this must be correct)
- R is in word but wrong position (from guess 3, it's not in position 3, which we already knew)
- T is in word but wrong position (from guess 3, it's not in position 4)

So updated constraints:
- A is fixed in position 3
- R is in word, not in positions 2 or 3
- T is in word, not in positions 1, 2, or 4
- Letters out: O, S, E, I, N, B, Y
- Pattern: _ _ A _ _

Now positions:
- R can be in 1 or 5 (since 2,3 are out)
- T must be in 5 (since 1,2,4 are out, and 3 is A)
- So T is in 5, R must be in 1 or 5, but T is in 5, so R must be in 1

Thus the word must be: R _ A _ T

Now fill positions 2 and 4 from remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible valid words:
- RADGT (invalid)

- RAPAT (invalid)
- RAKAT (invalid)
- RAVAT (invalid)
- RUFAT (invalid)
- RULAT (invalid)
- RUMAT (invalid)

None of these are valid. Let me think differently - maybe T is in 3, but A is in 3. No.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me re-examine:

From guess 3:
- T is in word but wrong position (not 4)
From guess 2:
- T is in word but wrong position (not 2)
From guess 1:
- T is not in arose feedback, so not in 1

So T must be in 3 or 5, but A is in 3, so T must be in 5.

Thus:
_ _ A _ T

R must be in 1 or 5, but 5 is T, so R must be in 1:

R _ A _ T

Now position 2 and 4 must be filled with letters not used yet (C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z)

Wait, let me try:

This seems problematic. Maybe I made an error in assuming R must be in 1. Let me re-examine:

From guess 3 (bartY):
- R(-) means R is in word but not in position 3 (which we already knew)
From guess 2 (train):
- R(-) means R is in word but not in position 2
Thus R can be in 1, 4, or 5

From guess 3:
- T(-) means T is in word but not in position 4
From guess 2:
- T(-) means T is in word but not in position 2
From guess 1:
- T not present in arose
Thus T can be in 1, 3, or 5, but:
- 1: not ruled out
- 3: A is here
- 5: possible

Thus T must be in 1 or 5

Let's consider both cases:

Case 1: T in 1
Pattern: T _ A _ _
R must be in 4 or 5 (since 2,3 are out)
Letters out: O, S, E, I, N, B, Y
Remaining letters: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Z

Possible:
- T R A _ _ (invalid, R would be in 2 which is out)
- T _ A R _
  - T _ A R _
  - Position 2 and 5 must be filled with remaining letters
  - Valid words: T C A R _ (need 5th letter)

  - T M A R _ - T M A R K - invalid
  - T P A R _ - T P A R K - invalid
  - T V A R _ - invalid
  - T W A R _ - invalid

Case 2: T in 5
Pattern: _ _ A _ T
R must be in 1, 4 (but 4 would be T's position if R is in 4, but T is in 5)
Wait:
- R can be in 1 or 4 (since 2,3,5 are out for R from previous feedback)
From guess 3 (bartY):
- R(-) means not in position 3 (already)
- From guess 2 (train):
- R(-) means not in position 2
Thus R can be in 1, 4, or 5
But T is in 5, so R must be in 1 or 4
