For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C appear most frequently in English words, so a good starting word should include several of these.

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", and ""STARE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. This should give us strong initial feedback about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- O, S, E are in the word and in the correct positions (3rd, 4th, 5th letters).
- A and R are not in the word at all.

So we know the secret word looks like: _ _ O S E

Next, we want a word that fits this pattern and uses other common letters. Common consonants not yet tried include T, N, L, D, C, M, etc. Common vowels not yet tried include I, U.

Let’s try a word like “MOOSE” – but M and O are possible, but O is already known to be in position 3, and we don’t know if M is in the word. Another option is “DOSES” – but S is already in position 4, and we don’t know if D is in the word. A better option is “TOUSE” – T, O, U, S, E. But O is in position 3, S in 4, E in 5, and T and U are new letters. However, “TOUSE” might not be a valid 5-letter word. 

Another valid word is “POSE” – but it’s 4 letters. Need 5 letters. 

“COUSE” is valid, but C is less common. 

“LOOSE” is valid, but O is already in position 3, and we don’t know if L is in the word. 

“DOUSE” is valid – D, O, U, S, E. This seems good because it introduces D and U, which are common letters not yet tried, while keeping O, S, E in their known correct positions.

So the next guess will be “DOUSE”.

2. DOUSE → D(x) O(✓) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)

   Adds that D and U are NOT in the word.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ O S E  
Letters already ruled out: A, R, D, U.

Letters still possible for positions 1 and 2: any of B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we can ignore S, D, U, A, R since they’re already ruled out).

Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.  
Common vowels left: I, Y (Y can act as a vowel).

We want a common 5-letter word that ends in OSE. Possible candidates:
- HOSE?  – but needs 5 letters, and “HOSE” is 4 letters.
- MOSE?  – not a word.
- NOSE?  – again 4 letters.
- POSE?  – 4 letters.
- COVE?  – ends in E, not OSE.
- HOVE?  – ends in E.
- LOSE?  – “LOSE” is a word, but it’s 4 letters.
- MOUSE – 5 letters, ends in OSE.  But U is already ruled out.
- BOSE?  – 4 letters.
- FOSE?  – not a word.
- GOSE?  – archaic.
- JOSE?  – 4 letters.
- KOSE?  – not a word.
- NOSE?  – 4 letters.
- POSE?  – 4 letters.
- SOSE?  – not a word.
- TOSE?  – not a word.
- VOSE?  – not a word.
- WOSE?  – not a word.
- YOSE?  – 4 letters.

Wait, let me double-check: “MOUSE” is 5 letters, ends in OSE, and doesn’t use any ruled-out letters (M, O, U, S, E). But U is ruled out from DOUSE feedback. So MOUSE is invalid because of U.

Next common 5-letter word ending in OSE: “POSE” is 4 letters. “COOSE” – not a word. “GOOSE” – has O in position 3 (correct), S in 4 (correct), E in 5 (correct), and G and O – but O is already in position 3, and we have no info on G yet. And O is allowed in position 1. So “GOOSE” is valid.

Let’s try “GOOSE”:
- G: new letter, possible.
- O: in position 1 (new position), but feedback says O is in position 3, so this would be wrong. So “GOOSE” is invalid.

Next: “JOSE” is 4 letters. “NOSE” is 4 letters. “BOSE” is 4 letters. “HOSE” is 4 letters. “LOSE” is 4 letters. “MOSE” is not a word. “YOSE” is 4 letters.

Hmm, seems limited. Maybe I missed. Let me think differently: the pattern is _ _ O S E, 5 letters. Common words with this pattern: “VOICE” – but ends in E, not OSE. “MOOSE” – U is ruled out. “POSE” – 4 letters. 

Wait, “NOOSE” – has O in position 3, S in 4, E in 5, and N and O. But O is already in position 3, and we have no issue with O in position 1. So “NOOSE” is 5 letters, ends in OSE, and uses N and O. But O is already confirmed in position 3, so this would place O in position 1 and 3, which is allowed (double letters). And N is new.

So “NOOSE” seems valid:
- N: new letter.
- O: in position 1 (new position), but feedback doesn’t prevent this; the only O info is position 3 is correct.
- O: position 3 is correct.
- S: position 4 is correct.
- E: position 5 is correct.

Thus, “NOOSE” is a valid candidate.

Another: “JOSE” is 4 letters. “KOSE” is not a word. “HOSE” is 4 letters. “BOSE” is 4 letters. 

“NOOSE” seems the best next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback, we know the word ends in “OSE” (positions 3-5) and that letters A, R, D, U are not in the word. The most common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is “NOOSE,” which introduces the new letter N while keeping the confirmed O, S, E.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C appear most frequently in English words, so a good starting word should include several of these.

After considering options like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", ""AROSE"", and ""STARE"", I'll go with ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) and has a good mix of vowels and consonants. This should give us strong initial feedback about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- O, S, E are in the word and in the correct positions (3rd, 4th, 5th letters).
- A and R are not in the word at all.

So we know the secret word looks like: _ _ O S E

Next, we want a word that fits this pattern and uses other common letters. Common consonants not yet tried include T, N, L, D, C, M, etc. Common vowels not yet tried include I, U.

Let’s try a word like “MOOSE” – but M and O are possible, but O is already known to be in position 3, and we don’t know if M is in the word. Another option is “DOSES” – but S is already in position 4, and we don’t know if D is in the word. A better option is “TOUSE” – T, O, U, S, E. But O is in position 3, S in 4, E in 5, and T and U are new letters. However, “TOUSE” might not be a valid 5-letter word. 

Another valid word is “POSE” – but it’s 4 letters. Need 5 letters. 

“COUSE” is valid, but C is less common. 

“LOOSE” is valid, but O is already in position 3, and we don’t know if L is in the word. 

“DOUSE” is valid – D, O, U, S, E. This seems good because it introduces D and U, which are common letters not yet tried, while keeping O, S, E in their known correct positions.

So the next guess will be “DOUSE”.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)
Guess 2: DOUSE -> FEEDBACK: D(x) O(✓) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(✓) S(✓) E(✓)  
   Pattern: _ _ O S E

2. DOUSE → D(x) O(✓) U(x) S(✓) E(✓)  
   Confirms O, S, E are still correct in positions 3, 4, 5.  
   Adds that D and U are NOT in the word.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ O S E  
Letters already ruled out: A, R, D, U.

Letters still possible for positions 1 and 2: any of B, C, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z (but we can ignore S, D, U, A, R since they’re already ruled out).

Common consonants left: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, N, P, T, etc.  
Common vowels left: I, Y (Y can act as a vowel).

We want a common 5-letter word that ends in OSE. Possible candidates:
- HOSE?  – but needs 5 letters, and “HOSE” is 4 letters.
- MOSE?  – not a word.
- NOSE?  – again 4 letters.
- POSE?  – 4 letters.
- COVE?  – ends in E, not OSE.
- HOVE?  – ends in E.
- LOSE?  – “LOSE” is a word, but it’s 4 letters.
- MOUSE – 5 letters, ends in OSE.  But U is already ruled out.
- BOSE?  – 4 letters.
- FOSE?  – not a word.
- GOSE?  – archaic.
- JOSE?  – 4 letters.
- KOSE?  – not a word.
- NOSE?  – 4 letters.
- POSE?  – 4 letters.
- SOSE?  – not a word.
- TOSE?  – not a word.
- VOSE?  – not a word.
- WOSE?  – not a word.
- YOSE?  – 4 letters.

Wait, let me double-check: “MOUSE” is 5 letters, ends in OSE, and doesn’t use any ruled-out letters (M, O, U, S, E). But U is ruled out from DOUSE feedback. So MOUSE is invalid because of U.

Next common 5-letter word ending in OSE: “POSE” is 4 letters. “COOSE” – not a word. “GOOSE” – has O in position 3 (correct), S in 4 (correct), E in 5 (correct), and G and O – but O is already in position 3, and we have no info on G yet. And O is allowed in position 1. So “GOOSE” is valid.

Let’s try “GOOSE”:
- G: new letter, possible.
- O: in position 1 (new position), but feedback says O is in position 3, so this would be wrong. So “GOOSE” is invalid.

Next: “JOSE” is 4 letters. “NOSE” is 4 letters. “BOSE” is 4 letters. “HOSE” is 4 letters. “LOSE” is 4 letters. “MOSE” is not a word. “YOSE” is 4 letters.

Hmm, seems limited. Maybe I missed. Let me think differently: the pattern is _ _ O S E, 5 letters. Common words with this pattern: “VOICE” – but ends in E, not OSE. “MOOSE” – U is ruled out. “POSE” – 4 letters. 

Wait, “NOOSE” – has O in position 3, S in 4, E in 5, and N and O. But O is already in position 3, and we have no issue with O in position 1. So “NOOSE” is 5 letters, ends in OSE, and uses N and O. But O is already confirmed in position 3, so this would place O in position 1 and 3, which is allowed (double letters). And N is new.

So “NOOSE” seems valid:
- N: new letter.
- O: in position 1 (new position), but feedback doesn’t prevent this; the only O info is position 3 is correct.
- O: position 3 is correct.
- S: position 4 is correct.
- E: position 5 is correct.

Thus, “NOOSE” is a valid candidate.

Another: “JOSE” is 4 letters. “KOSE” is not a word. “HOSE” is 4 letters. “BOSE” is 4 letters. 

“NOOSE” seems the best next guess.Based on the feedback, we know the word ends in “OSE” (positions 3-5) and that letters A, R, D, U are not in the word. The most common 5-letter word fitting this pattern is “NOOSE,” which introduces the new letter N while keeping the confirmed O, S, E.

From the three guesses we now know:

2. Letters NOT in the word: A, R, D, U, N

   - First O(✓) → the O in position 3 is correct.
   - Second O(✓) → the O in position 4 is correct.
   - S(✓) and E(✓) remain as before.

So the secret word looks like: _ _ O S E

Remaining common consonants: B, C, F, G, H, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y, Z  
Remaining common vowels: I, Y

- SOSE? – not a word.
- TOSE? – not a word.
- VOSE? – not a word.
- WOSE? – not a word.
- YOSE? – 4 letters.

Wait, let me double-check: “MOOSE” was ruled out due to U.  
“POSE” is 4 letters.  
“GOOSE” was ruled out because the O in position 1 would conflict with the O in position 3 (but feedback allows multiple O’s).  

Actually, “GOOSE” has G, O, O, S, E – the first O would be in position 1, but feedback only guarantees the O in position 3 is correct. There’s no rule against having another O in position 1. So “GOOSE” is still possible.

Similarly, “HOSE” is 4 letters.  
“JOSE” is 4 letters.  
“KOSE” is not a word.  
“LOSE” is 4 letters.  
“MOSE” is not a word.  
“POSE” is 4 letters.  
“SOSE” is not a word.  
“TOSE” is not a word.  
“VOSE” is not a word.  
“WOSE” is not a word.  
“YOSE” is 4 letters.

Another candidate: “VOICE” – but ends in E, not OSE.  

“GOOSE” seems the only common 5-letter word left that fits _ _ O S E and hasn’t been ruled out entirely. Let’s try it.

GOOSE:
- G: new letter.
- O: position 1 (new position).
- O: position 2 (new position).
- S: position 3 (correct).
- E: position 4 (correct).

But wait, the pattern is _ _ O S E, so positions 3-5 must be O S E. Therefore, “GOOSE” has O in positions 1 and 2, S in 3, E in 4 – but we need S in 4 and E in 5. So “GOOSE” is G O O S E, which fits _ _ O S E with G and O in positions 1 and 2. But O is already confirmed in position 3, so this would have O in positions 1, 2, 3 – but the word can’t have O in positions 1 and 2 because the feedback only guarantees position 3 is correct. There’s no restriction on other O’s, but “GOOSE” has O in positions 1 and 2, which is allowed by the rules.

However, the most straightforward word fitting _ _ O S E is “GOOSE”.

But let me reconsider: the pattern is positions 3-5 = O S E. So the word is [1][2]O S E. Common words with this form:
- BOSE? – 4 letters.
- COSE? – not a word.
- FOSE? – not a word.
- GOSE? – archaic.
- HOSE? – 4 letters.
- JOSE? – 4 letters.
- KOSE? – not a word.

- POSE? – 4 letters.
- SOSE? – not a word.
- TOSE? – not a word.
- VOSE? – not a word.
- WOSE? – not a word.
- YOSE? – 4 letters.

It appears “GOOSE” is actually the only common 5-letter word left in standard English that fits [1][2]O S E. Even though it has O in positions 1 and 2, the rules don’t forbid it, and it hasn’t been ruled out. So “GOOSE” is the logical next guess.

But wait, “GOOSE” has G in position 1 and O in position 2, then O S E. This would be G O O S E, which has O in positions 2 and 3. The feedback only guarantees position 3 (O) and position 4 (S) and position 5 (E) are correct. There’s no issue with an extra O in position 2. So “GOOSE” is valid.

Therefore, the next guess is “GOOSE”.
