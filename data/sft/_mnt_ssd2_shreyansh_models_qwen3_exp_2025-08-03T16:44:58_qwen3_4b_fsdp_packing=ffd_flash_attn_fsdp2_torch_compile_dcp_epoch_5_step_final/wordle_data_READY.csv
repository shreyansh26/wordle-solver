### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess and I have no prior information about the secret word, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters in English to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. A good starting word should have:

1. Common vowels (A, E, I, O, U)
2. Common consonants (like R, S, T, L, N)
3. No repeated letters to maximize the number of distinct letters tested

Some popular starting words include:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRISP (C, R, I, S, P)
- ADIEU (A, D, I, E, U)

I'll go with ""CRANE"" as it's widely considered an effective starting word due to its use of very common letters.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C is NOT in the word (x)
- R is in the word but wrong position (-)
- A is in the correct position (✓) – so the word is _ _ A _ _
- N is NOT in the word (x)
- E is in the word but wrong position (-)

So the secret word:
- Has A in the 3rd spot.
- Contains R and E somewhere, but not in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
- Does NOT contain C, N, or any other letters already ruled out.

Good letters to try next: S, T, L, I, O, U, D, M, P, etc.

I need a word with:
- A in position 3
- Must include R and E (but R cannot be in position 2 and E cannot be in position 5)
- No C, N

Possible candidates:
- STARE (but E is in position 5 which is invalid)
- TRAIL (but A is not in position 3)
- LEARN (but N is invalid)
- GREAT (R in 2, E in 5 – both positions are invalid)
- STARE is invalid because E can’t be in position 5.
- PEARS: P E A R S – A is in position 3, R is in 4 (not 2), E is in 2 (not 5) – this satisfies all constraints.

PEARS:
- P (new letter)
- E (in word, position 2 – allowed since it’s not position 5)

Current known facts:
1. Pattern: _ E A _ _
2. Letters in word somewhere: R (not in position 4), E (correct in position 2), A (correct in position 3)
3. Letters ruled out: C, N, P, S
4. Still need to test other common consonants and vowels.

Good remaining letters: T, L, D, M, B, G, K, F, H, Y, etc.

We need a word fitting:
- E in position 2
- A in position 3
- Contains R (but not in position 4)
- No C, N, P, S

Possible R positions: 1, 3, 4, 5 (but 3 is A, so 1, 4, 5). However, from CRANE feedback, R was in position 2 and marked as wrong position, so R cannot be in position 2. From PEARS feedback, R was in position 4 and marked as wrong position, so R cannot be in position 4. Thus R must be in position 1 or 5.

So possible patterns:
- R E A _ _
- _ E A _ R

Let's think of words fitting these patterns, using remaining letters.

First pattern: R E A _ _
Possible: REACT (but C is ruled out), READY (D is still possible), REACT (invalid), REBEL (B, L allowed), REBID (B, D allowed), RECAB (invalid), REDOX (invalid), REEFS (invalid), RERUN (invalid), RAVEN (A is in position 3, but word would be A in position 3, E in 2, R in 1: R E A _ _), but we need A in position 3.

Wait, the pattern is _ E A _ _ from the feedback, so:
- First pattern: R E A _ _
- Second pattern: _ E A _ R

Let's list possible words:
- R E A _ _: READY (D, Y), REBEL (B, E), but E is already in position 2. REBEL has E in position 4 which is allowed since E is only required to be in position 2. READY has D, A, Y.
- _ E A _ R: T E A _ R (T, E, A, _, R) – TEA is 3 letters, need 5. Possible: TEARD (D), TEACH (invalid), TEAKY (invalid), TEBRA (invalid), TEBAR (invalid), TEBRA is invalid, TEKRA (invalid), TELAR (invalid), TEMAR (invalid), TEPAR (invalid), TEVRA (invalid), TEWAR (invalid), TEXAR (invalid), TEYAR (invalid).

From these, READY seems like a good candidate:
- R E A D Y
- Letters: R (position 1), E (position 2 ✓), A (position 3 ✓), D (new), Y (new)
- No ruled-out letters used (C, N, P, S absent)
- R is in position 1 (allowed)
- E and A are correctly placed

Another candidate could be REBEL, but B and L are less common than D and Y.

READY seems optimal.
