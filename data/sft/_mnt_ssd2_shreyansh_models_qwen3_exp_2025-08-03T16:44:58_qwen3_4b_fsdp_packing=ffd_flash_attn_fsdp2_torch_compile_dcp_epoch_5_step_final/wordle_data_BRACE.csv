### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R is in the correct position (2nd letter).
- O and S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).

So we know the pattern is: _ R _ _ E
We also know A appears somewhere in the word (but not in position 1).
Letters NOT in the word: O, S.

Good next guesses should use the known letters R and E in their correct positions, include A in a different spot, and avoid O and S. A strong candidate is ""RANGE"":
- R is already locked in position 2.
- A could be in position 3 or 4 (not 1).
- N and G are common letters not yet tested.
- E is locked in position 5.
This should give us more information about A's correct placement and test new consonants.

Let's digest the new feedback from RANGE:
- R appears in the feedback as (-), so R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (it was position 2 in AROSE and still marked (-) in RANGE, which is impossible unless the feedback system is relative—probably R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2).  
- A appears as (-) again, so A is in the word but not in position 2.  
- N and G are marked (x), so they are NOT in the word.  
- E is still (✓) in position 5.

Combining with prior:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E  
- Letters in word: A, R (each must appear once)  
- Letters not in word: O, S, N, G  
- Positions so far:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from AROSE and RANGE feedback).  
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from RANGE feedback).  
  – E is fixed at position 5.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing both A and R exactly once, avoiding O, S, N, G.  
Common remaining letters: T, I, L, C, H, M, D, B, etc.

Let’s try to place A and R in valid spots:
- A could be in positions 3 or 4.  
- R could be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E), so positions 3 or 4.

Let’s construct candidates:
- If A is in 3: _ _ A _ E, then R must be in 4: _ _ A R E → e.g., “CARET” (invalid: T not yet tested, but C and T are allowed).  
- If A is in 4: _ _ _ A E, then R must be in 3: _ _ R A E → e.g., “CRAVE” (V is untested, but allowed).

“CRAVE” uses C, R, A, V, E. It ends in E, includes R and A in new positions (3 and 4), and avoids all excluded letters. It tests V, which is a high-frequency consonant.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(✓) O(x) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position.
- R is in the correct position (2nd letter).
- O and S are not in the word at all.
- E is in the correct position (5th letter).

So we know the pattern is: _ R _ _ E
We also know A appears somewhere in the word (but not in position 1).
Letters NOT in the word: O, S.

Good next guesses should use the known letters R and E in their correct positions, include A in a different spot, and avoid O and S. A strong candidate is ""RANGE"":
- R is already locked in position 2.
- A could be in position 3 or 4 (not 1).
- N and G are common letters not yet tested.
- E is locked in position 5.
This should give us more information about A's correct placement and test new consonants.

Guess 2: RANGE -> FEEDBACK: R(-) A(-) N(x) G(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Let's digest the new feedback from RANGE:
- R appears in the feedback as (-), so R is in the word but NOT in position 1 (it was position 2 in AROSE and still marked (-) in RANGE, which is impossible unless the feedback system is relative—probably R is in the word but not in position 1 or 2).  
- A appears as (-) again, so A is in the word but not in position 2.  
- N and G are marked (x), so they are NOT in the word.  
- E is still (✓) in position 5.

Combining with prior:
- Pattern: _ _ _ _ E  
- Letters in word: A, R (each must appear once)  
- Letters not in word: O, S, N, G  
- Positions so far:
  – A cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from AROSE and RANGE feedback).  
  – R cannot be in positions 1 or 2 (from RANGE feedback).  
  – E is fixed at position 5.

We need a 5-letter word ending in E, containing both A and R exactly once, avoiding O, S, N, G.  
Common remaining letters: T, I, L, C, H, M, D, B, etc.

Let’s try to place A and R in valid spots:
- A could be in positions 3 or 4.  
- R could be in positions 3, 4, or 5 (but 5 is E), so positions 3 or 4.

Let’s construct candidates:
- If A is in 3: _ _ A _ E, then R must be in 4: _ _ A R E → e.g., “CARET” (invalid: T not yet tested, but C and T are allowed).  
- If A is in 4: _ _ _ A E, then R must be in 3: _ _ R A E → e.g., “CRAVE” (V is untested, but allowed).

“CRAVE” uses C, R, A, V, E. It ends in E, includes R and A in new positions (3 and 4), and avoids all excluded letters. It tests V, which is a high-frequency consonant.

Let’s go with CRAVE.
