For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it covers common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

- _ O R _ E: might get “CORER” (but C and R already used), “GONER” (G, N allowed), “LONER” (L, N allowed), “MONER” (not a word), “TONER” (T, N allowed). “GONER” and “LONER” are both valid.
- _ O _ R E: might get “DORER” (double R), “GONER” again, “HONER” (H, N allowed), “MONER” (not valid), “TONER” again.

4. The letters A, S, W are NOT in the word (x in their guesses).

So the pattern so far is:
_ O _ _ E   (positions 2 and 5 locked)

and the word must contain R somewhere in positions 1, 3, or 4.

Also, no A, S, W.

Let’s list possible placements of R:
- R in position 1 → R O _ _ E
- R in position 3 → _ O R _ E
- R in position 4 → _ O _ R E

We need to pick a valid 5-letter English word that fits one of these patterns and doesn’t contain A, S, W.

Check each case:
- R O _ _ E: possible words like RODGE (but G and D may work) – but RODGE is obscure.
- _ O R _ E: might get “CORER” (but C and R already used), “GONER” (G, N allowed), “LONER” (L, N allowed), “MONER” (not a word), “TONER” (T, N allowed). “GONER” and “LONER” are both valid.
- _ O _ R E: might get “DORER” (double R), “GONER” again, “HONER” (H, N allowed), “MONER” (not valid), “TONER” again.

The most common, valid words here are “GONER” and “LONER”. Between these, I’ll choose “GONER” because G, O, N, E, R are all allowed and common letters.

Let’s consolidate what we now know after the three guesses.

1. E is in position 5 (✓ in guesses 1 and 2).
2. O is in position 2 (✓ in guess 2).
3. R is in the word but NOT in positions 2, 4, or 5 (it was (-) in all those positions).
   So R must be in position 1 or 3.
4. Letters that are NOT in the word: A, S, W, N.

Current pattern:
[?] O [?] [?] E   (positions 2 and 5 locked)

and R must appear in position 1 or 3.

Also, we have:
- G(-) in guess 3 → G is in the word but not in position 1.
- E(-) in guess 3 → E is in the word but not in position 4 (we already knew it was in position 5, so this is redundant).

So the word must contain:
- O in position 2
- E in position 5
- R in position 1 or 3
- G somewhere (but not in position 1 if R is in 1, and not in position 1 at all if R is in 3)

Let’s explore the two possible placements of R:

Case 1: R in position 1
Pattern: R O _ _ E
We need to place G in one of the remaining positions (3 or 4), and fill the other with a valid letter (not A, S, W, N, and not O or E which are already used).

Possible words:
- R O G _ E → R O G ? E. The missing letter must be common and not excluded. Possible: R O G E ? No, E is already in 5. R O G ? E → R O G A E (invalid, A excluded), R O G U E (valid word “ROUGE” but U is allowed).
- R O _ G E → R O ? G E. The missing letter must be valid. Possible: R O B G E (invalid), R O M G E (invalid), R O T G E (invalid), R O D G E (invalid), R O C G E (invalid), R O V G E (invalid). No valid English word here.

Case 2: R in position 3
Pattern: _ O R _ E
We need to place G in one of the remaining positions (1 or 4), and fill the other with a valid letter.

Subcase 2a: G in position 1
Pattern: G O R _ E
The missing letter must be valid and not excluded. Possible: G O R B E (invalid), G O R D E (invalid), G O R F E (invalid), G O R I E (valid word “GORIE” is not common), G O R K E (invalid), G O R L E (invalid), G O R M E (invalid), G O R P E (invalid), G O R T E (invalid), G O R V E (invalid). The only common word here is “GORIE” but it’s not standard.

Subcase 2b: G in position 4
Pattern: _ O R G E
The missing letter must be valid and not excluded. Possible first letters: B, C, D, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Looking for common English words:
- B O R G E → “BORGE” is not a standard word.
- C O R G E → “CORGE” is not standard.
- D O R G E → “DORGE” is not standard.
- F O R G E → “FORGE” is a valid word.
- H O R G E → “HORGE” is not standard.
- L O R G E → “LORGE” is not standard.
- M O R G E → “MORGE” is not standard.
- P O R G E → “PORGE” is not standard.
- T O R G E → “TORGE” is not standard.

The only valid word we can find is “FORGE”.

Let’s verify:
- F is not excluded (not in any x feedback).
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- R is in position 3 (allowed, since it was (-) only in positions 2,4,5 and now in 3 which is new).

For my first guess in Wordle, I want to choose a word that uses common letters and can help eliminate many possibilities. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it covers common consonants (S, L, T) and vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E).

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A: not in the word (x)
- R: in the word but wrong position (-)
- O: in the word but wrong position (-)
- S: not in the word (x)
- E: correct position and letter (✓)

So far we know:
1. The word must contain E in position 5 (E is the last letter).
2. The word must contain R and O, but neither R nor O is in their original positions (R was position 2, O was position 3).
3. The word does not contain A or S.

I need a 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E
- Contains R and O somewhere not in positions 2 or 3 respectively
- Does not contain A or S

Possible positions for R: 1, 3, 4 (but O can't be in 3)
Possible positions for O: 1, 2, 4 (but R can't be in 2)

Let me think of words that fit:
- Could be ""ROUTE"" but O is in position 2 which is allowed since O was in position 3 before.
- ""DROVE"" - O in position 2, R in position 2 is not allowed (R can't be in position 2)
- ""GROPE"" - O in position 3 is not allowed (O can't be in position 3)
- ""BROKE"" - O in position 2, R in position 2 is not allowed
- ""TROPE"" - O in position 2, R in position 2 is not allowed
- ""CRORE"" - but R is in position 2 which is not allowed
- ""FRORE"" - same issue with R in position 2
- ""GORED"" - ends with D, not E
- ""MORED"" - same issue
- ""WORSE"" - ends with E, O in position 2, R in position 4 - this seems valid:
  - Ends with E (position 5)
  - Contains O in position 2 (was originally in 3, now allowed)
  - Contains R in position 4 (was originally in 2, now allowed)

From the latest feedback on FORGE:
- F(x) – F is not in the word.
- O(✓) – O is correctly placed in position 2.
- R(-) – R is in the word but NOT in position 3 (it was (-) in positions 2,3,4,5 so far).
- G(✓) – G is correctly placed in position 4.
- E(✓) – E is correctly placed in position 5.

So we now know the pattern: _ O _ G E  
and the word must contain R somewhere in the remaining blanks (positions 1 or 3), and the letters already eliminated are: A, S, W, N, F.

Also, letters not yet used that are still possible: B, C, D, H, I, J, K, L, M, P, Q, T, U, V, X, Y, Z.

Because R cannot be in position 3 (it was (-) there in FORGE), R must be in position 1.  
Thus the pattern becomes: R O _ G E.

The only unknown is the third letter, which must be a valid consonant not yet ruled out.  
Looking for common English 5-letter words that fit R O ? G E:

- R O B G E → invalid (ROBGE not a word)
- R O C G E → invalid
- R O D G E → invalid
- R O K G E → invalid
- R O T G E → invalid
- R O M G E → invalid
- R O L G E → invalid
- R O P G E → invalid
- R O H G E → invalid
- R O V G E → invalid

The only actual word that fits is R O G U E (but U is allowed and not yet excluded).  
However, R O G U E is valid and satisfies all constraints:
- R O G U E
- Position 1: R (must be here, since it couldn’t be in 3)
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: G (but G is already known to be in position 4 – wait, this is impossible)

Wait, let’s double-check: the pattern is _ O _ G E, and we determined R must be in position 1, making the word R O _ G E.  
The only valid word that fits is R O U G E (ROUGH E), but that’s not a word.  
Actually, the correct word is R O U G E (French-derived spelling), but in English the valid word is R O U G E → “ROUGE”.  

But “ROUGE” is indeed a valid English word (a type of rouge powder).  
Let’s verify:
- R O U G E
- Position 1: R (must be here, since it couldn’t be in 3)
- Position 2: O (✓)
- Position 3: U (allowed, not excluded)
- Position 4: G (✓)
- Position 5: E (✓)

All constraints satisfied.
