For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

One of the most recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). However, another popular choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common. 

After considering options, ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong due to the inclusion of O, which is very common and often overlooked in starting words. It also contains S and E, two of the most frequent letters. Therefore, ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess to maximize information about the secret word's letters.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S
- Position of E is fixed at position 5.
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already taken by E), so O must be in 1, 2, or 4.

We need a new guess that:
1. Keeps E in position 5.
2. Places O in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, or 4).
3. Avoids A, R, S.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible common letters to try: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's try ""OCEAN"":
- O in position 1 (valid since O can be in 1, 2, or 4)
- C, E, A, N - but A is already known to be absent, so this is bad.

Next try ""OFTEN"":
- O in position 1
- F, T, E, N - avoids forbidden letters and tests new ones
- E is correctly placed at position 5

This seems good as it keeps E in place, moves O to position 1, and tests F, T, N which are common and untested.

Another check: ""DOING"":
- D, O, I, N, G - but E is not in position 5 here, so invalid.

Best choice seems ""OFTEN"".

The feedback on Guess 2 (""OF TEN"") says the model answer is not five letters, so ""OF TEN"" is not considered a valid 5-letter word for this puzzle. I need to correct that and choose a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E (E is in position 5).
2. Contains O in one of positions 1, 2, or 4 (since O is in the word but not in position 3).
3. Does not contain A, R, or S.
4. Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good candidate letters to test now: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A word that fits these requirements is ""OFTEN"" but since it's invalid, I'll try ""OPIUM"" - but that ends with M, not E. Next, ""OLIVE"" - ends with E, has O in position 1, and tests L, I, V. But V is less common. 

Better to test more common letters: ""OFTEN"" is invalid, so ""ONSET"" is invalid (has S). ""OCEAN"" invalid (has A). ""ONION"" - ends with N, not E. 

Best valid option seems ""OLIVE"" but let me check - yes, OLIVE is 5 letters, ends with E, has O in position 1, and tests L, I, V. Although V is less common, it's acceptable. 

Another option: ""OCEAN"" invalid (A), ""ONCER"" invalid (R), ""OFTEN"" invalid (already noted). 

""OLIVE"" is valid and meets all constraints. 

But let me think of a word that tests more common letters: ""ONION"" invalid (ends with N), ""OVINE"" - ends with E, has O in position 1, tests V, I, N. V is okay, but OVINE might be too obscure.

Better: ""OFTEN"" invalid, so ""OPIES"" - but S is invalid. 

Actually, ""OFTEN"" is invalid, so I need to try ""OLIVE"" or similar. 

But let me re-examine: the feedback says ""Model answer is not five letters"" when I wrote ""OF TEN"". So ""OF TEN"" is not a valid guess here. 

I need to choose a valid 5-letter word ending with E, containing O not in position 3, avoiding A, R, S. 

Good options:
- ""OFTEN"" - invalid (not a word)
- ""OLIVE"" - valid, ends with E, O in position 1, tests L, I, V
- ""ONION"" - invalid (ends with N)
- ""OVINE"" - valid, ends with E, O in position 1, tests V, I, N

""OLIVE"" seems best as it tests L, I, V - all common letters.

But wait, ""OVINE"" is more common as a word (relating to sheep), and tests V, I, N.

Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S
- Position of E is fixed at position 5.
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already taken by E), so O must be in 1, 2, or 4.

We need a new guess that:
1. Keeps E in position 5.
2. Places O in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, or 4).
3. Avoids A, R, S.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible common letters to try: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's try ""OCEAN"":
- O in position 1 (valid since O can be in 1, 2, or 4)
- C, E, A, N - but A is already known to be absent, so this is bad.

Next try ""OFTEN"":
- O in position 1
- F, T, E, N - avoids forbidden letters and tests new ones
- E is correctly placed at position 5

This seems good as it keeps E in place, moves O to position 1, and tests F, T, N which are common and untested.

Another check: ""DOING"":
- D, O, I, N, G - but E is not in position 5 here, so invalid.

Best choice seems ""OFTEN"".

Guess 2: OF TEN -> FEEDBACK: Model answer is not five letters.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback on Guess 2 (""OF TEN"") says the model answer is not five letters, so ""OF TEN"" is not considered a valid 5-letter word for this puzzle. I need to correct that and choose a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E (E is in position 5).
2. Contains O in one of positions 1, 2, or 4 (since O is in the word but not in position 3).
3. Does not contain A, R, or S.
4. Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good candidate letters to test now: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A word that fits these requirements is ""OFTEN"" but since it's invalid, I'll try ""OPIUM"" - but that ends with M, not E. Next, ""OLIVE"" - ends with E, has O in position 1, and tests L, I, V. But V is less common. 

Better to test more common letters: ""OFTEN"" is invalid, so ""ONSET"" is invalid (has S). ""OCEAN"" invalid (has A). ""ONION"" - ends with N, not E. 

Best valid option seems ""OLIVE"" but let me check - yes, OLIVE is 5 letters, ends with E, has O in position 1, and tests L, I, V. Although V is less common, it's acceptable. 

Another option: ""OCEAN"" invalid (A), ""ONCER"" invalid (R), ""OFTEN"" invalid (already noted). 

""OLIVE"" is valid and meets all constraints. 

But let me think of a word that tests more common letters: ""ONION"" invalid (ends with N), ""OVINE"" - ends with E, has O in position 1, tests V, I, N. V is okay, but OVINE might be too obscure.

Better: ""OFTEN"" invalid, so ""OPIES"" - but S is invalid. 

Actually, ""OFTEN"" is invalid, so I need to try ""OLIVE"" or similar. 

But let me re-examine: the feedback says ""Model answer is not five letters"" when I wrote ""OF TEN"". So ""OF TEN"" is not a valid guess here. 

I need to choose a valid 5-letter word ending with E, containing O not in position 3, avoiding A, R, S. 

Good options:
- ""OFTEN"" - invalid (not a word)
- ""OLIVE"" - valid, ends with E, O in position 1, tests L, I, V
- ""ONION"" - invalid (ends with N)
- ""OVINE"" - valid, ends with E, O in position 1, tests V, I, N

""OLIVE"" seems best as it tests L, I, V - all common letters.

But wait, ""OVINE"" is more common as a word (relating to sheep), and tests V, I, N. 

I'll go with ""OVINE"".

From all feedback so far:

“MOTEL” is the clearest valid word here.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

One of the most recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). However, another popular choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common. 

After considering options, ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong due to the inclusion of O, which is very common and often overlooked in starting words.

Rules:
- Position 5 must be E (from Guess 1).  
- O is now confirmed in position 2 (✓).  
- E is in the word but NOT in position 5 (from Guess 4) … yet we already know E must be in position 5 (from Guess 1).  
  That’s a contradiction unless the feedback is interpreted as:  
  – E is in the word but its current placement (position 4) is wrong.  
  – So E must still be in position 5, and the feedback for Guess 4 simply shows E is not in position 4.

Thus:
- Positions: _ O _ _ E  
- Letters ruled out so far: A, R, S, V, I, N, M, T  
- Still usable: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, P, U, W, Y, etc.

Another scan: **BOGEY** (5 letters), but Y is allowed and not yet banned.

Check B, O, G, E, Y – none are in the banned list.  
“BOGEY” is a recognized word (British English variant of “bother”).  
It places O in position 2 and E in position 5, satisfying both constraints.

Therefore, BogeY is the logical next guess.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequent letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good starting word should use as many of these as possible while being a valid 5-letter word. 

One of the most recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E). However, another popular choice is ""SLATE"" which covers S, L, A, T, E - also very common. 

After considering options, ""AROSE"" seems particularly strong due to the inclusion of O, which is very common and often overlooked in starting words. It also contains S and E, two of the most frequent letters. Therefore, ""AROSE"" is a strong first guess to maximize information about the secret word's letters.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(x) E(✓)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x): A is not in the word.
- R(x): R is not in the word.
- O(-): O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x): S is not in the word.
- E(✓): E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Letters definitely in the word: O, E
- Letters definitely NOT in the word: A, R, S
- Position of E is fixed at position 5.
- O can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (but 5 is already taken by E), so O must be in 1, 2, or 4.

We need a new guess that:
1. Keeps E in position 5.
2. Places O in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, or 4).
3. Avoids A, R, S.
4. Uses other common letters to maximize information.

Possible common letters to try: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let's try ""OCEAN"":
- O in position 1 (valid since O can be in 1, 2, or 4)
- C, E, A, N - but A is already known to be absent, so this is bad.

Next try ""OFTEN"":
- O in position 1
- F, T, E, N - avoids forbidden letters and tests new ones
- E is correctly placed at position 5

This seems good as it keeps E in place, moves O to position 1, and tests F, T, N which are common and untested.

Another check: ""DOING"":
- D, O, I, N, G - but E is not in position 5 here, so invalid.

Best choice seems ""OFTEN"".

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The feedback on Guess 2 (""OF TEN"") says the model answer is not five letters, so ""OF TEN"" is not considered a valid 5-letter word for this puzzle. I need to correct that and choose a valid 5-letter word that:
1. Ends with E (E is in position 5).
2. Contains O in one of positions 1, 2, or 4 (since O is in the word but not in position 3).
3. Does not contain A, R, or S.
4. Uses other common letters to gain more information.

Good candidate letters to test now: T, L, N, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

A word that fits these requirements is ""OFTEN"" but since it's invalid, I'll try ""OPIUM"" - but that ends with M, not E. Next, ""OLIVE"" - ends with E, has O in position 1, and tests L, I, V. But V is less common. 

Better to test more common letters: ""OFTEN"" is invalid, so ""ONSET"" is invalid (has S). ""OCEAN"" invalid (has A). ""ONION"" - ends with N, not E. 

Best valid option seems ""OLIVE"" but let me check - yes, OLIVE is 5 letters, ends with E, has O in position 1, and tests L, I, V. Although V is less common, it's acceptable. 

Another option: ""OCEAN"" invalid (A), ""ONCER"" invalid (R), ""OFTEN"" invalid (already noted). 

""OLIVE"" is valid and meets all constraints. 

But let me think of a word that tests more common letters: ""ONION"" invalid (ends with N), ""OVINE"" - ends with E, has O in position 1, tests V, I, N. V is okay, but OVINE might be too obscure.

Better: ""OFTEN"" invalid, so ""OPIES"" - but S is invalid. 

Actually, ""OFTEN"" is invalid, so I need to try ""OLIVE"" or similar. 

But let me re-examine: the feedback says ""Model answer is not five letters"" when I wrote ""OF TEN"". So ""OF TEN"" is not a valid guess here. 

I need to choose a valid 5-letter word ending with E, containing O not in position 3, avoiding A, R, S. 

Good options:
- ""OFTEN"" - invalid (not a word)
- ""OLIVE"" - valid, ends with E, O in position 1, tests L, I, V
- ""ONION"" - invalid (ends with N)
- ""OVINE"" - valid, ends with E, O in position 1, tests V, I, N

""OLIVE"" seems best as it tests L, I, V - all common letters.

But wait, ""OVINE"" is more common as a word (relating to sheep), and tests V, I, N. 

I'll go with ""OVINE"".

4. Remaining common untested letters: T, L, C, D, M, P, U, G, B, H, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Ends with E (position 5 = E).
- Contains O in position 2 or 4.
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate structures:
- _ O _ _ E  (O in position 2)
- _ _ _ O E  (O in position 4)

Let’s test _ O _ _ E first.  
Simple common letters: T, L, C, D, M, P.

Possible words:
- MOTEL  (M, O, T, E, L) – all letters allowed, common word.
- POTEE  (invalid – double E not helpful, and P is okay but not common)
- BOTHE  (invalid – H not ruled out, but word is obscure)
- GOTEL  (invalid – G, O, T, E, L – but “GOTEL” isn’t a standard word)

“MOTEL” is the clearest valid word here.

Check against constraints:
- Ends with E ✔
- Contains O in position 2 ✔
- Letters M, O, T, E, L – none are in the banned list (A, R, S, V, I, N) ✔

Therefore, MOTEL is the optimal next guess.

Let’s carefully re-examine the constraints after the fifth guess.

Current known facts:
1. Position 5 must be E (from Guess 1 and 2).  
2. O is fixed in position 2 (✓ from Guess 4).  
3. Letters we have ruled out:  
   A, R, S, V, I, N, M, T, B, Y  
4. From Guess 5 (BOGEY → B(x) O(✓) G(-) E(-) Y(x)):  
   - G is in the word but not in position 3.  
   - E is in the word but not in position 4 (we already know it must be in position 5, so this is consistent).

So the pattern is:  
_ O _ _ E  
with G somewhere in positions 1, 4 (cannot be 3, and 2 and 5 are already taken by O and E).

Available letters (not yet ruled out):  
C, D, F, H, J, K, L, P, U, W, G (with G allowed in positions 1 or 4).

We need a valid 5-letter English word that fits:  
- Position 2 = O  
- Position 5 = E  
- G appears once, in position 1 or 4  
- Other positions filled with letters from C, D, F, H, J, K, L, P, U, W

Candidate words:
- G O _ _ E: Need two more letters from allowed set.  
  – G O C K E – valid word “GOCKE” is not common.  
  – G O F F E – invalid (double F not helpful).  
  – G O L D E – “GOLDE” is not a standard spelling.  
  – G O P E E – invalid.  
- _ O G _ E: Need letters in positions 1 and 4 from allowed set.  
  – C O G E – too short.  
  – F O G E – too short.  
  – L O G E – too short.  
  – P O G E – too short.  
  – C O G E – again too short.  
  – H O G E – again too short.  
  – J O G E – again too short.  
  – K O G E – again too short.  
  – W O G E – again too short.  
  – C O G E – again too short.  

Wait, let’s list all valid 5-letter English words fitting _ O G _ E with letters from allowed set:
- COGUE – but U is allowed and not yet ruled out.  
  Check: C, O, G, U, E – none are in the banned list.  
  “COGUE” is a valid variant spelling of “cogue” (British English for “cough”).  

Another possibility:
- FOULE – but F is allowed, U is allowed, L is allowed.  
  Check: F, O, U, L, E – none banned.  
  “FOULE” is a valid word (French-derived adjective meaning “covered in flour”).  

But we need to choose the most common word. Between “COGUE” and “FOULE”, “FOULE” is slightly more common.

Therefore, the best next guess is:

<guess>FOULE</guess>
