### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good feedback on 5 different common letters.

Looking for common endings: “SAR” is the start, need two more letters. Possible words:
- SARDO – but O is out
- SARAN – but N is out
- SARAT – T is still possible
- SARDY – Y is possible
- SARGY – G, Y possible

The most common among these is “SARDY” (though not a dictionary word). Another valid dictionary word is “SARDO” but O is eliminated.

Next, test A in position 4: S _ R A _

Possible words:
- SCRAB – but C, B are possible
- SHRAP – but H is possible
- SPRAW – P, W possible
- STRAW – T, W possible (T is very common)

“STRAW” is a valid word and uses only allowed letters.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C. A good strategy is to pick a word with these letters while avoiding duplicates to test as many letters as possible.

One such word is ""AROSE"" - it contains A, R, O, S, E which are all very common letters. This will give us good feedback on 5 different common letters.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(-)  → A is in the word but not in position 1.
- R(-)  → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(x)  → O is NOT in the word.
- S(-)  → S is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(x)  → E is NOT in the word.

So far we know:
- Letters present: A, R, S
- Letters absent: O, E
- Possible positions for A: 2-5 (not 1)
- Possible positions for R: 1, 3-5 (not 2)
- Possible positions for S: 1-3, 5 (not 4)

We need a word that contains A, R, S and avoids O, E. A good next guess should place these letters in new positions to narrow down possibilities.

A word that fits these constraints and tests new positions for all three letters is ""RAISE"":
- R in position 1 (new for R)
- A in position 2 (new for A)
- I (new letter)
- S in position 4 (but S cannot be in position 4 from feedback, so this is bad)

Let me try ""SARIN"":
- S in position 1 (new for S)
- A in position 2 (new for A)
- R in position 3 (new for R)
- I (new letter)
- N (new letter)

This avoids O, E and tests new positions for A, R, S.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: sarin -> FEEDBACK: S(✓) A(-) R(✓) I(x) N(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: arose → A(-) R(-) O(x) S(-) E(x)  
Guess 2: sarin → S(✓) A(-) R(✓) I(x) N(x)

What we now know for sure:

1. Letters that are in the word: S (position 1), R (position 3), and A (somewhere, but not position 1 or 2).
2. Letters that are NOT in the word: O, E, I, N.

So the pattern so far is:
S _ R _ _

A must appear in either position 2, 4, or 5.

The remaining unused common letters (avoiding O, E, I, N) are: T, L, D, C, K, B, G, H, U, M, Y, F, etc.

We need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Starts with S
- Has R in position 3
- Contains A in position 2, 4, or 5
- Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Let’s test A in position 2: S A R _ _

Looking for common endings: “SAR” is the start, need two more letters. Possible words:
- SARDO – but O is out
- SARAN – but N is out
- SARAT – T is still possible
- SARDY – Y is possible
- SARGY – G, Y possible

The most common among these is “SARDY” (though not a dictionary word). Another valid dictionary word is “SARDO” but O is eliminated.

Next, test A in position 4: S _ R A _

Possible words:
- SCRAB – but C, B are possible
- SHRAP – but H is possible
- SPRAW – P, W possible
- STRAW – T, W possible (T is very common)

“STRAW” is a valid word and uses only allowed letters.

Let me check:
- S(✓) in position 1
- T (new letter)
- R(✓) in position 3
- A (must be in word, and here it’s in position 4 – allowed)
- W (new letter)

This seems optimal.
