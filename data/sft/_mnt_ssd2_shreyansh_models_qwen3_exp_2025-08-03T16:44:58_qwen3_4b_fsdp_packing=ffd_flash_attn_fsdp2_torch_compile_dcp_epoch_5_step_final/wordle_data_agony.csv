For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L

One of the most recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a high chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and gathering useful feedback.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters across different positions. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to Wordle analysis.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (no ✓, so it must be in positions 2-5)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with A
2. Contains O somewhere in positions 2-5
3. Does not contain R, S, E

Next steps:
- Keep A in position 1
- Try to place O in different positions (2,3,4,5)
- Introduce new common consonants and vowels not yet tried (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.)

Good candidate words:
- A _ O _ _ : could be ALOOF, AMBIT, ANGEL (but E is out), ARBOR (but R is out)
- A _ _ O _ : could be ACTOR (R out), AMBIT (but I is new), ANGEL (E out)
- A _ _ _ O : could be ABBOT, ADDIO, AGONY, AMBIT

Looking at common 5-letter words fitting these patterns, ""AMBIT"" looks promising:
- Starts with A
- Has O in position 4 (new position for O)
- Introduces new letters M, B, I, T

But let's check if any letters are ruled out: M, B, I, T are all still possible.

Another good option is ""AGONY"":
- A fixed in position 1
- O in position 4 (new position)
- G, N, Y are new letters

But ""AGONY"" is less common. ""AMBIT"" seems more straightforward.

However, let's also consider ""AFOOT"" - but double O might be unlikely.

After reconsidering, ""AMBIT"" is still the best choice for introducing new common letters while respecting the constraints.

   - AROSE: A(✓) in position 1, O(✓) in position 3.  
   - AMBIT: A(✓) in position 1, O was not marked ✓, and wasn’t in position 4.  
   So O must be in position 3 (from AROSE) and also not in position 4 (from AMBIT), but that’s already satisfied.  
   Therefore O is definitely in position 3.

3. Letters ruled out so far: R, S, E, M, B, I, T.

Available consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: U (since A and O are already used, and E, I are ruled out)

- ANKLE  (E ruled out)  
- AFOOT  (double O, unlikely)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with A
2. Contains O somewhere in positions 2-5
3. Does not contain R, S, E

Next steps:
- Keep A in position 1
- Try to place O in different positions (2,3,4,5)
- Introduce new common consonants and vowels not yet tried (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.)

Good candidate words:
- A _ O _ _ : could be ALOOF, AMBIT, ANGEL (but E is out), ARBOR (but R is out)
- A _ _ O _ : could be ACTOR (R out), AMBIT (but I is new), ANGEL (E out)
- A _ _ _ O : could be ABBOT, ADDIO, AGONY, AMBIT

Looking at common 5-letter words fitting these patterns, ""AMBIT"" looks promising:
- Starts with A
- Has O in position 4 (new position for O)
- Introduces new letters M, B, I, T

But let's check if any letters are ruled out: M, B, I, T are all still possible.

Another good option is ""AGONY"":
- A fixed in position 1
- O in position 4 (new position)
- G, N, Y are new letters

But ""AGONY"" is less common. ""AMBIT"" seems more straightforward.

However, let's also consider ""AFOOT"" - but double O might be unlikely.

After reconsidering, ""AMBIT"" is still the best choice for introducing new common letters while respecting the constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: AMBIT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(x) B(x) I(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with A (A(✓) in both guesses).
2. O is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4 or 5 (from AMBIT feedback: O wasn’t marked ✓, and in AROSE it wasn’t in position 2).  
   Therefore O must be in position 1, but position 1 is already A, so this seems impossible.  
   Wait — let’s re-read carefully:

   - AROSE: A(✓) in position 1, O(✓) in position 3.  
   - AMBIT: A(✓) in position 1, O was not marked ✓, and wasn’t in position 4.  
   So O must be in position 3 (from AROSE) and also not in position 4 (from AMBIT), but that’s already satisfied.  
   Therefore O is definitely in position 3.

3. Letters ruled out so far: R, S, E, M, B, I, T.

So the pattern is now:
A _ O _ _

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out.  
Available consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: U (since A and O are already used, and E, I are ruled out)

Let’s look for common 5-letter words matching A _ O _ _.

Examples:
- ACOID  (but I is ruled out)  
- AGOON  (but O is already used in position 3)  
- AFOUL  (F and U are still possible)  
- ALOUD  (A already used, L, O, U, D possible)  
- ANGEL  (E ruled out)  
- ANKLE  (E ruled out)  
- AFOOT  (double O, unlikely)  
- AULIC  (not common)  
- ALOOF  (O already used in position 3)  

The most common and valid word left is “ALOUD”:
- A ✓ _ O _ D  
- But position 2 is L, position 4 is U, and D is position 5.  
  Check letters: L and U have not been ruled out, and D hasn’t been used yet.

Another candidate is “AFOUL”:
- A ✓ F O U L  
But we need to check if all letters are still possible: F, U, L are allowed.

However, “ALOUD” is more common and fits the pattern perfectly.

Therefore, the next best guess is:

ALOUD

From all feedback so far:

1. A is fixed in position 1 (✓ in every guess).
2. O is fixed in position 3 (✓ in AROSE and not ruled out in subsequent guesses).
3. Letters ruled out: R, S, E, M, B, I, T, L, U, D.

So the pattern is:
A _ O _ _

We still need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters not yet eliminated.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and the vowel A (but A is already used in position 1).

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L

One of the most recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a high chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and gathering useful feedback.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters across different positions. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to Wordle analysis.

For the first guess, it's strategic to choose a word that contains common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. The goal is to quickly identify which letters are in the word and their possible positions. 

A good starting word typically includes:
- Common vowels like A, E, I, O, U
- Common consonants like S, T, R, N, L

One of the most recommended starting words is ""AROSE"" because it contains three vowels (A, O, E) and two very common consonants (R, S). This gives us a high chance of hitting at least some letters in the secret word and gathering useful feedback.

Another excellent choice is ""SLATE"" for similar reasons - it covers common letters across different positions. However, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it has slightly better letter frequency coverage according to Wordle analysis.

Make a new 5-letter word guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) R(x) O(✓) S(x) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word and in the correct first position (✓)
- R is not in the word (x)
- O is in the word but in the wrong position (no ✓, so it must be in positions 2-5)
- S is not in the word (x)
- E is not in the word (x)

So far we know:
1. Word starts with A
2. Contains O somewhere in positions 2-5
3. Does not contain R, S, E

Next steps:
- Keep A in position 1
- Try to place O in different positions (2,3,4,5)
- Introduce new common consonants and vowels not yet tried (like T, N, L, C, D, etc.)

Good candidate words:
- A _ O _ _ : could be ALOOF, AMBIT, ANGEL (but E is out), ARBOR (but R is out)
- A _ _ O _ : could be ACTOR (R out), AMBIT (but I is new), ANGEL (E out)
- A _ _ _ O : could be ABBOT, ADDIO, AGONY, AMBIT

Looking at common 5-letter words fitting these patterns, ""AMBIT"" looks promising:
- Starts with A
- Has O in position 4 (new position for O)
- Introduces new letters M, B, I, T

But let's check if any letters are ruled out: M, B, I, T are all still possible.

Another good option is ""AGONY"":
- A fixed in position 1
- O in position 4 (new position)
- G, N, Y are new letters

But ""AGONY"" is less common. ""AMBIT"" seems more straightforward.

However, let's also consider ""AFOOT"" - but double O might be unlikely.

After reconsidering, ""AMBIT"" is still the best choice for introducing new common letters while respecting the constraints.

Here is some previous feedback:

Guess 2: AMBIT -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) M(x) B(x) I(x) T(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the two rounds of feedback we now know:

1. The word starts with A (A(✓) in both guesses).
2. O is in the word but not in positions 2, 3, 4 or 5 (from AMBIT feedback: O wasn’t marked ✓, and in AROSE it wasn’t in position 2).  
   Therefore O must be in position 1, but position 1 is already A, so this seems impossible.  
   Wait — let’s re-read carefully:

   - AROSE: A(✓) in position 1, O(✓) in position 3.  
   - AMBIT: A(✓) in position 1, O was not marked ✓, and wasn’t in position 4.  
   So O must be in position 3 (from AROSE) and also not in position 4 (from AMBIT), but that’s already satisfied.  
   Therefore O is definitely in position 3.

3. Letters ruled out so far: R, S, E, M, B, I, T.

So the pattern is now:
A _ O _ _

We need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters not yet ruled out.  
Available consonants: C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Available vowels: U (since A and O are already used, and E, I are ruled out)

Let’s look for common 5-letter words matching A _ O _ _.

Examples:
- ACOID  (but I is ruled out)  
- AGOON  (but O is already used in position 3)  
- AFOUL  (F and U are still possible)  
- ALOUD  (A already used, L, O, U, D possible)  
- ANGEL  (E ruled out)  
- ANKLE  (E ruled out)  
- AFOOT  (double O, unlikely)  
- AULIC  (not common)  
- ALOOF  (O already used in position 3)  

The most common and valid word left is “ALOUD”:
- A ✓ _ O _ D  
- But position 2 is L, position 4 is U, and D is position 5.  
  Check letters: L and U have not been ruled out, and D hasn’t been used yet.

Another candidate is “AFOUL”:
- A ✓ F O U L  
But we need to check if all letters are still possible: F, U, L are allowed.

However, “ALOUD” is more common and fits the pattern perfectly.

Therefore, the next best guess is:

ALOUD

From all feedback so far:

1. A is fixed in position 1 (✓ in every guess).
2. O is fixed in position 3 (✓ in AROSE and not ruled out in subsequent guesses).
3. Letters ruled out: R, S, E, M, B, I, T, L, U, D.

So the pattern is:
A _ O _ _

We still need to fill positions 2 and 4 with letters not yet eliminated.  
Allowed letters (not yet ruled out): C, F, G, H, J, K, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z, and the vowel A (but A is already used in position 1).

Common consonants for these positions: C, F, G, H, K, N, P, V, W.

Looking for common 5-letter words matching A _ O _ _ with these letters:

- ACOOK  (but K is allowed, and O is already in position 3)  
- AFORK  (but R is ruled out)  
- AGOON  (O is already in position 3)  
- AFOOT  (O is already in position 3)  
- AHOOP  (H and P are allowed)  
- ANKOU  (but U is ruled out)  
- ANGEL  (E is ruled out)  
- ANKLE  (E is ruled out)  
- AFOUL  (U is ruled out)  
- ALOUD  (already tried)  
- ACOID  (I is ruled out)  

The only remaining common word that fits is “ACOOK”:
A C O O K  
But this has a double O (positions 3 and 4), and we already know O is in position 3.  
However, the feedback for ALOUD showed D(x), but didn’t comment on double letters.  
Since no feedback yet rules out double O, and all letters C, O, K are still valid, this seems acceptable.

But let’s check if any other simple word exists.  
Another possibility is “ACORN” but R is ruled out.  
“AFKOO” is not a word.  

“ACOOK” appears to be the only valid common word left fitting the pattern and letter constraints.

Therefore, the next guess is:

From all feedback so far:

1. A is fixed in position 1 (✓ in every guess).
2. O is fixed in position 3 (✓ in AROSE and not ruled out in subsequent guesses).
3. We now know the word has two O’s: one in position 3 and one in position 5 (because the second O in AFOGO was marked “-” in position 4, and the O in position 5 was also “-”; however, “-” only indicates the letter is in the word but NOT in that position, so position 5 O is actually confirmed to be in the word, meaning the second O must be in position 5).
