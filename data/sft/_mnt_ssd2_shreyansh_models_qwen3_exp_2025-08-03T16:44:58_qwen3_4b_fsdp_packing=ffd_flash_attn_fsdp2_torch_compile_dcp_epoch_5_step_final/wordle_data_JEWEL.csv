For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. Among these, I'll pick a word that uses several high-frequency letters in common positions to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

A good starting word should also avoid repetition to test as many unique letters as possible. After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", I'll go with one that has 5 unique common letters. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) without repetition, giving us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.  
- R(x) – R is not in the word.  
- O(x) – O is not in the word.  
- S(x) – S is not in the word.  
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 5).

So far we know:
- The word must contain the letter E somewhere, but not at the end (since it’s marked “-” in the 5th spot).
- It definitely does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

To maximize new information, I want a word that:
1. Places E in a different position (positions 1–4).
2. Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (e.g., T, N, L, I, C, H, U, D).
3. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

A good candidate is “UNTIE”:
- It has E in position 4 (new position).
- It introduces U, N, T, I (all high-frequency letters not yet tested).
- It contains no ruled-out letters.

This should efficiently narrow down remaining possibilities.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most frequently used letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. Among these, I'll pick a word that uses several high-frequency letters in common positions to quickly identify which letters are in the secret word.

A good starting word should also avoid repetition to test as many unique letters as possible. After considering options like ""AROSE"", ""SLATE"", or ""CRANE"", I'll go with one that has 5 unique common letters. 

""AROSE"" is an excellent first choice because it contains 5 of the most common letters (A, R, O, S, E) without repetition, giving us maximum information about which letters are present in the secret word.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: arose -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on “arose”:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.  
- R(x) – R is not in the word.  
- O(x) – O is not in the word.  
- S(x) – S is not in the word.  
- E(-) – E is in the word but in the wrong position (currently at position 5).

So far we know:
- The word must contain the letter E somewhere, but not at the end (since it’s marked “-” in the 5th spot).
- It definitely does NOT contain A, R, O, or S.

To maximize new information, I want a word that:
1. Places E in a different position (positions 1–4).
2. Uses other common letters that haven’t been ruled out (e.g., T, N, L, I, C, H, U, D).
3. Avoids A, R, O, S entirely.

A good candidate is “UNTIE”:
- It has E in position 4 (new position).
- It introduces U, N, T, I (all high-frequency letters not yet tested).
- It contains no ruled-out letters.

This should efficiently narrow down remaining possibilities.

<|im_end|>

From the two guesses we have:

1. arose → A(x) R(x) O(x) S(x) E(-)  
   – E is in the word but not in position 5.

2. untie → U(x) N(x) T(x) I(x) E(-)  
   – E is still in the word but not in position 5 (confirmed again), and none of U, N, T, I are in the word at all.

Letters we now know are NOT in the word: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I.

Letters we know ARE in the word: E (somewhere, but not position 5).

Remaining high-frequency letters not yet tested: D, L, C, G, H, M, P, B, F, K, Y, W, V, etc.

To place E in a new position (1–4) and test several fresh common letters, a good word is “DECKY”:
- Contains E in position 2.
- Introduces D, C, K, Y (all new, none ruled out).
- Uses no excluded letters.

This maximizes information by checking four new common letters while positioning E in a different spot.

Known pattern: _ E _ _ _

Still-unused high-frequency letters: B, F, G, H, L, M, P, W, V, J, Q, X, Z (though the last few are rare).

We need a 5-letter word with E fixed in position 2 and no other ruled-out letters.  
A good next step is to test several fresh common consonants in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

Consider “BEMF” – but that’s not a valid word.  
“FEMUR” contains R (ruled out).  
“HEMAL” contains A (ruled out).  
“BLOKE” contains K (ruled out).  
“PHEW” contains W and P, both still possible.

“PHEW” is a valid word, uses P and W (not yet tested), and keeps E in position 2.

Another candidate is “GUESS” but S is ruled out.  
“L E M P S” – invalid or too obscure.

“PHEW” seems ideal: valid, simple, tests two new letters, and respects all constraints.

Therefore, I will guess “PHEW”.

I made a mistake – “phew” is only 4 letters.  
I need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2 (confirmed).  
- Contains none of the ruled-out letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, D, C, K, Y, P.  
- Uses fresh letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

Available letters left: B, F, G, H, L, M, V, W, Z, J, Q, X (but only common ones).

Try “BEMF” – invalid.  
“FEM” – too short.  
“GUESS” – S ruled out.  
“HEM” – too short.  
“JEWEL” – J, E, W, E, L – E appears twice, but we already know E is in position 2; second E would be in position 4. Is a double E allowed? The rules don’t forbid it, and we haven’t ruled out double letters. Also, J and L are still possible.

“JEWEL” is a valid 5-letter word, uses J and L (not yet tested), keeps E in position 2, and doesn’t reuse any ruled-out letters.

Another candidate: “GUELL” – U ruled out.  
“BELGA” – A ruled out.  
“FEMUR” – U, R ruled out.  
“JEWEL” seems the best.

Let’s go with “JEWEL”.

I made two errors:
1. “phew” is 4 letters, not 5.  
2. “journal” is 7 letters, not 5.

To fix this, I need a valid 5-letter word that:
- Has E in position 2 (confirmed).  
- Contains none of the ruled-out letters: A, R, O, S, U, N, T, I, D, C, K, Y, P, J.  
- Uses fresh letters in positions 1, 3, 4, 5.

Available letters left: B, F, G, H, L, M, V, W, Z, Q, X (only common ones).

Possible candidates:
- “BEMF” – invalid.  
- “FEM” – too short.  
- “HEM” – too short.  
- “GUELL” – U ruled out.  
- “BELGA” – A ruled out.  
- “FEMUR” – U, R ruled out.  
- “GEM” – too short.  
- “BEM” – too short.

Looking at valid 5-letter words with E in position 2 and no ruled-out letters:
- “BEM” is invalid.  
- “FEM” is invalid.  
- “H” + “E” + “M” combinations are too short.  
- “G” + “E” + “M” combinations are too short.

Wait, let me list all valid 5-letter words with E in position 2 and check letters:
- “BEMF” – invalid.  
- “FEM” – invalid.  
- “HEM” – invalid.  
- “JEWEL” – J, E, W, E, L – J and L are still possible, but E appears twice. The rules don’t forbid doubles, and we haven’t ruled out E elsewhere. Also, W is still possible.

“JEWEL” is 5 letters, has E in position 2, uses J and L (not ruled out), and the second E is allowed.

Let me verify:
- J: not ruled out.  
- E: allowed (confirmed in position 2).  
- W: not ruled out.  
- E: allowed (double).  
- L: not ruled out.

Therefore, “JEWEL” is valid.
