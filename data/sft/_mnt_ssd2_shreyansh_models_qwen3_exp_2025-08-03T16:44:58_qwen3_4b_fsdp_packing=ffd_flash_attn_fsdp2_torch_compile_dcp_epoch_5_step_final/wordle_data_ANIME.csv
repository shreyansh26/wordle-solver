### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess in Wordle, it's best to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize information gain. The letters E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, and C appear most frequently in 5-letter English words, so a good starting word should include several of these. 

Some popular first guesses are:
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E)
- CRATE (C, R, A, T, E)
- STARE (S, T, A, R, E)

I'll go with CRANE as it covers five very common letters and has a good vowel-consonant balance.

From the feedback on CRANE:
- C(x) → C is not in the word.
- R(x) → R is not in the word.
- A(-) → A is in the word but not in position 3.
- N(-) → N is in the word but not in position 4.
- E(✓) → E is in the word and in position 5.

So far we know:
- Word ends with E.
- Contains A and N somewhere other than positions 3 and 4 respectively.
- Does NOT contain C or R.

I need a word with:
- E in position 5.
- A somewhere except position 3.

Good candidate letters: A, N, S, T, L, O, I, etc.

Let me think of words that fit:
- Must end with E.
- Have A and N in other positions.

Examples:
- STANE (but has N in position 4, which is invalid because N cannot be in position 4)
- PANE (but is 4 letters, invalid)
- BANES (ends with S, invalid)
- LANCE (has C, invalid)
- PANE (4 letters again)
- SNAKE (ends with E, has A in position 2 and N in position 3 - this could work)
- TNAKE (invalid word)
- GNAWE (invalid word)
- SNAKE seems valid - S, N, A, K, E. Ends with E, has A in position 2 (not 3), has N in position 3 (not 4), and no C or R.

Let me check SNAKE:
- S: new letter, but could be correct.
- N: in position 3 (allowed, since N was not allowed in position 4)
- A: in position 2 (allowed, since A was not allowed in position 3)
- K: new letter

- Letters still in play: A, B, D, F, G, H, I, J, L, M, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- E in position 5.
- N in position 2.
- A somewhere except position 3.
- No C, R, S, K.

Possible patterns: _ N _ _ E, with A somewhere in positions 1, 4, or (if A is last) 5 (but 5 is E), so positions 1 or 4.

Let’s list valid words:
1. BANAL – but A is in position 2, which is N, so no.
2. DANCE – C is invalid.
3. FANAL – not a word.
4. GNAWE – G, N, A, W, E – A in position 3, which is invalid.
5. LANCE – C invalid.
6. MANFE – not a word.
7. PANE – too short.
8. TNAPE – not a word.
9. BANET – not a word.
10. DANEL – not a word.
11. FANET – not a word.
12. GANET – not a word.
13. HANET – not a word.
14. JANET – not a word.
15. LANET – not a word.
16. MANGE – M, A, N, G, E – A in position 2 (N is position 2, so no).
17. PANGE – not a word.
18. WANGE – not a word.
19. BANAL – already seen.
20. DANCE – C invalid.
21. FANGY – Y at end, but needs E.

24. JANET – already seen.
25. LANET – already seen.
26. MANGE – already seen.

28. TANGE – T, A, N, G, E – A in position 2 (N is position 2, so no).
29. VANGE – not a word.
30. WANGE – already seen.

Wait, let’s re-examine: the word must be _ N _ _ E, with A in position 1 or 4, and no C, R, S, K.

Possible combinations:
- Position 1: A → A N _ _ E
  - Possible: ANIME – but I, M are allowed. Let’s check: A(1), N(2), I(3), M(4), E(5). No C, R, S, K. A is in position 1 (allowed), N in 2 (correct), E in 5 (correct). This seems valid.
  - ANIME is a valid 5-letter word.

- Position 1: _ N A _ E
  - Possible: BNAFE – not a word.

  - FNAFE – not a word.

  - MNAFE – not a word.
  - PNAFE – not a word.
  - TNAFE – not a word.
  - VNAFE – not a word.
  - WNAFE – not a word.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints appears to be ANIME.

Let me verify:
- ANIME: A, N, I, M, E
- C, R, S, K not present.
- E in position 5: ✓
- N in position 2: ✓
- A in position 1 (not 3): ✓
- No forbidden letters: ✓

Therefore, ANIME is the optimal next guess.

  - JNAFE – not a word.
  - LNAFE – not a word.
  - MNAFE – not a word.
  - PNAFE – not a word.
  - TNAFE – not a word.
  - VNAFE – not a word.
  - WNAFE – not a word.

Thus, the only valid word fitting all constraints appears to be ANIME.

Let me verify:
- ANIME: A, N, I, M, E
- C, R, S, K not present.
- E in position 5: ✓
- N in position 2: ✓
- A in position 1 (not 3): ✓
- No forbidden letters: ✓

Therefore, ANIME is the optimal next guess.",Guess 3: ANIME -> FEEDBACK: A(✓) N(✓) I(✓) M(✓) E(✓),SUCCESS
