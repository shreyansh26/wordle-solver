For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants, or vice versa, to test multiple letters efficiently.

Some strong opening words include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E - 4 vowels, 1 consonant)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E - 3 vowels, 2 consonants)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E - 3 vowels, 2 consonants)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it tests 4 vowels and 1 very common consonant, giving us good coverage for the first guess.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong place (currently at position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong place (currently at position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, E
- Letters present somewhere: O, S
- O and S must appear in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since they’re not in position 3).

We need a word that:
1. Contains O and S (and no A, R, E).
2. Places O and S in different positions than 3.
3. Uses other common consonants to maximize information.

Possible letters to try next: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let’s pick a word that satisfies:
- O not in position 3
- S not in position 4
- Uses new common consonants

One good candidate is “SOUND”:
- S is in position 1 (new position for S)
- O is in position 2 (new position for O)

From the two rounds of feedback we have:

1. AROSE → A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
   - Letters not in the word: A, R, E
   - Letters in the word but not in their guessed positions: O, S

2. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(-) D(x)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1 (from SOUND).
   - O is now confirmed in position 2 (✓ at index 2).
   - U and N are in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 respectively.
   - D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but position 2 is O), so S can only be in 3, 4, or 5.
- U and N must each be in one of the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5), excluding the positions they were in last time (U not in 3, N not in 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains S, U, and N exactly once each.
- Places S in 3, 4, or 5.
- Places U not in 3 and N not in 4.

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Possible S positions: 3, 4, 5
- Possible U positions: 1, 4, 5 (but must be unique)
- Possible N positions: 1, 3, 5 (but must be unique)

One systematic way is to try placing S in each possible position and see if we can fit U and N.

Try S in position 3:
- Word form: _ O S _ _
- U must be in 1, 4, or 5 (not 3)
- N must be in 1 or 5 (cannot be 4)
- Possible combinations:
  - U in 1, N in 5: U O S _ N → need a letter for position 4. Possible letters: from remaining unused consonants like T, M, P, etc. ""UOS_TN"" – need valid word.
  - U in 4, N in 5: _ O S U N → need a letter for position 1. ""TOSUN"" is not a word, ""MOSUN"" – no, etc.

Try S in position 4:
- Word form: _ O _ S _
- U must be in 1 or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4)
- N must be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 4)
- Possible combinations:
  - U in 1, N in 3: U O N S _ → need a letter for position 5. ""UONST_"" – no valid word.
  - U in 5, N in 1: N O U S _ → need a letter for position 4. ""NOUS_"" – ""NOUS"" plus a letter, but ""NOUSH"" – no, ""NOUS"" is 4 letters.

Try S in position 5:
- Word form: _ O _ _ S
- U must be in 1 or 4 (cannot be 3)
- N must be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 4)
- Possible combinations:
  - U in 1, N in 3: U O N _ S → need a letter for position 4. ""UON_T S"" – ""UONTS"" – no.
  - U in 4, N in 1: N O U _ S → need a letter for position 3. ""NOU_S"" – ""NOUST"" – no.

Hmm, none of these seem to make valid words. Maybe we need to try different letters. Let’s think of actual words that fit:

We need:
- O in position 2.
- Must contain S, U, N.
- S in 3, 4, or 5.
- U not in 3, N not in 4.

Possible word: ""FOIST"" – but F isn't tested yet, and I is unused. But we already know O is in position 2, so:
- F O I S T – but N must be present. So no.

Next: ""JOINT"" – but J is unused, and T is possible, but N is in 4 which is invalid.

Next: ""POINT"" – P, I, N, T. O in 2, N in 4 – but N cannot be in 4. So invalid.

Next: ""SOUND"" – already used.

Next: ""UNION"" – but O is in 2, so:
- U N I O N – but O is not in 2. So invalid.

Next: ""SUNNY"" – but Y is possible, but N is in 4 which is invalid.

Next: ""SUING"" – G is possible, but N is in 4 which is invalid.

Next: ""SPOOK"" – P, K, but O is in 2, and K is possible, but N must be present. So no.

Next: ""CLOUD"" – but D is out, and L is possible, but N must be present. So no.

Next: ""BOUND"" – D is out.

Next: ""FOULS"" – but L is possible, S in 5, N must be present. So no.

Next: ""GONYS"" – G, Y, N, S, but O is in 2, N in 3, S in 5. But N is in 3 which is allowed (only restriction is N not in 4). But this is a valid word? ""GONYS"" is a plural of ""gonys"" (not common). Maybe not the best.

Next: ""IONIC"" – but C is possible, but N is in 3, O in 2, but must have S. So no.

Next: ""JONES"" – J, E, but E is out.

Next: ""LUNAR"" – A is out, R is out.

Next: ""MONKS"" – K is possible, but N is in 2 which is O. So no.

Next: ""PONYS"" – P, Y, S, N in 4 which is invalid.

Next: ""SONIC"" – C is possible, but N is in 3, O in 2, S in 1, but S cannot be in 1 (from SOUND feedback). So invalid.

Next: ""TONIC"" – T, I, C. O in 2, N in 3, but must have S. So no.

Next: ""VOINS"" – V, I, N, S. O in 2, N in 3, S in 5. This seems possible:
- V O I N S – letters: V, O, I, N, S. 
- O is in 2 (correct).
- S is in 5 (allowed, since S must be in 3,4,5 and 5 is ok).
- N is in 3 (allowed, since N must not be in 4).
- I is a new letter to test.
- V is a new letter to test.

""VOINS"" is a valid word (plural of ""vain"" in some contexts, or ""voin"" is a word in Russian, but in English it's acceptable).

But let me check if there's a more common word. ""VOINS"" might be obscure.

Alternative: ""SONIC"" – but S is in 1 which is invalid.

Alternative: ""PONYS"" – N is in 4 which is invalid.

Alternative: ""FOIST"" – missing N.

Alternative: ""JONES"" – E is invalid.

Alternative: ""MONKS"" – missing E, and N is in 3 which is allowed, but K is possible, but must have S in 3,4,5. Here S is in 4 which is allowed. But N is in 3 which is allowed. But K is possible. But this is ""MONKS"" – letters M, O, N, K, S. O in 2, N in 3, S in 5. This seems valid:
- M O N K S
- O in 2 (correct).
- S in 5 (allowed).
- N in 3 (allowed).
- K is new letter to test.
- M is new letter to test.

But we need to ensure all letters are valid. ""MONKS"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""CONIC"" – but C is possible, but N is in 3, O in 2, S must be present. So no.

Another option: ""TONIC"" – missing S.

Another option: ""IONIC"" – missing S.

Another option: ""JONAS"" – J, A, S – A is out.

Another option: ""DONOS"" – D is out.

Another option: ""GONOS"" – G, N, O, S – but must be 5 letters with O in 2. So ""GONOS"" is 4 letters.

Another option: ""BOONS"" – B, O, O, N, S – but O is in 2, so second O is extra, and N is in 4 which is invalid.

Another option: ""COONS"" – C, O, O, N, S – same issue with N in 4.

Another option: ""FOONS"" – same issue.

Another option: ""HONKS"" – H, O, N, K, S – O in 2, N in 3, S in 5. This is valid:
- H O N K S
- H is new letter.
- K is new letter.
- N is in 3 (allowed).
- S is in 5 (allowed).

This seems better as ""HONKS"" is a common word.

Let me verify:
- H O N K S
- Position 2: O (correct).
- S is in 5 (allowed, since S must be in 3,4,5 and not in 1 or 2).
- N is in 3 (allowed, since N must not be in 4).
- H and K are new letters to test.

Thus, ""HONKS"" is a good next guess.
</think>

Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- Position 2 is definitely O.
- S must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- U and N are in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 respectively.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, D.

A word that satisfies these constraints is ""HONKS"":
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- H and K are new letters to test.

   - Letters not in the word: A, R, E
   - Letters in the word but not in their guessed positions: O, S

2. SOUND → S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(-) D(x)
   - S is still in the word but not in position 1 (from SOUND).
   - O is now confirmed in position 2 (✓ at index 2).
   - U and N are in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 respectively.
   - D is not in the word.

So far we know:
- Position 2 is O.
- S must be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 (but position 2 is O), so S can only be in 3, 4, or 5.
- U and N must each be in one of the remaining positions (1, 3, 4, 5), excluding the positions they were in last time (U not in 3, N not in 4).

We need a 5-letter word that:
- Has O in position 2.
- Contains S, U, and N exactly once each.
- Places S in 3, 4, or 5.
- Places U not in 3 and N not in 4.

Let’s list possible positions:
- Position 2: O (fixed)
- Possible S positions: 3, 4, 5
- Possible U positions: 1, 4, 5 (but must be unique)
- Possible N positions: 1, 3, 5 (but must be unique)

One systematic way is to try placing S in each possible position and see if we can fit U and N.

Try S in position 3:
- Word form: _ O S _ _
- U must be in 1, 4, or 5 (not 3)
- N must be in 1 or 5 (cannot be 4)
- Possible combinations:
  - U in 1, N in 5: U O S _ N → need a letter for position 4. Possible letters: from remaining unused consonants like T, M, P, etc. ""UOS_TN"" – need valid word.
  - U in 4, N in 5: _ O S U N → need a letter for position 1. ""TOSUN"" is not a word, ""MOSUN"" – no, etc.

Try S in position 4:
- Word form: _ O _ S _
- U must be in 1 or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4)
- N must be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 4)
- Possible combinations:
  - U in 1, N in 3: U O N S _ → need a letter for position 5. ""UONST_"" – no valid word.
  - U in 5, N in 1: N O U S _ → need a letter for position 4. ""NOUS_"" – ""NOUS"" plus a letter, but ""NOUSH"" – no, ""NOUS"" is 4 letters.

Try S in position 5:
- Word form: _ O _ _ S
- U must be in 1 or 4 (cannot be 3)
- N must be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 4)
- Possible combinations:
  - U in 1, N in 3: U O N _ S → need a letter for position 4. ""UON_T S"" – ""UONTS"" – no.
  - U in 4, N in 1: N O U _ S → need a letter for position 3. ""NOU_S"" – ""NOUST"" – no.

Hmm, none of these seem to make valid words. Maybe we need to try different letters. Let’s think of actual words that fit:

We need:
- O in position 2.
- Must contain S, U, N.
- S in 3, 4, or 5.
- U not in 3, N not in 4.

Possible word: ""FOIST"" – but F isn't tested yet, and I is unused. But we already know O is in position 2, so:
- F O I S T – but N must be present. So no.

Next: ""JOINT"" – but J is unused, and T is possible, but N is in 4 which is invalid.

Next: ""POINT"" – P, I, N, T. O in 2, N in 4 – but N cannot be in 4. So invalid.

Next: ""SOUND"" – already used.

Next: ""UNION"" – but O is in 2, so:
- U N I O N – but O is not in 2. So invalid.

Next: ""SUNNY"" – but Y is possible, but N is in 4 which is invalid.

Next: ""SUING"" – G is possible, but N is in 4 which is invalid.

Next: ""SPOOK"" – P, K, but O is in 2, and K is possible, but N must be present. So no.

Next: ""CLOUD"" – but D is out, and L is possible, but N must be present. So no.

Next: ""BOUND"" – D is out.

Next: ""FOULS"" – but L is possible, S in 5, N must be present. So no.

Next: ""GONYS"" – G, Y, N, S, but O is in 2, N in 3, S in 5. But N is in 3 which is allowed (only restriction is N not in 4). But this is a valid word? ""GONYS"" is a plural of ""gonys"" (not common). Maybe not the best.

Next: ""IONIC"" – but C is possible, but N is in 3, O in 2, but must have S. So no.

Next: ""JONES"" – J, E, but E is out.

Next: ""LUNAR"" – A is out, R is out.

Next: ""MONKS"" – K is possible, but N is in 2 which is O. So no.

Next: ""PONYS"" – P, Y, S, N in 4 which is invalid.

Next: ""SONIC"" – C is possible, but N is in 3, O in 2, S in 1, but S cannot be in 1 (from SOUND feedback). So invalid.

Next: ""TONIC"" – T, I, C. O in 2, N in 3, but must have S. So no.

Next: ""VOINS"" – V, I, N, S. O in 2, N in 3, S in 5. This seems possible:
- V O I N S – letters: V, O, I, N, S. 
- O is in 2 (correct).
- S is in 5 (allowed, since S must be in 3,4,5 and 5 is ok).
- N is in 3 (allowed, since N must not be in 4).
- I is a new letter to test.
- V is a new letter to test.

""VOINS"" is a valid word (plural of ""vain"" in some contexts, or ""voin"" is a word in Russian, but in English it's acceptable).

But let me check if there's a more common word. ""VOINS"" might be obscure.

Alternative: ""SONIC"" – but S is in 1 which is invalid.

Alternative: ""PONYS"" – N is in 4 which is invalid.

Alternative: ""FOIST"" – missing N.

Alternative: ""JONES"" – E is invalid.

Alternative: ""MONKS"" – missing E, and N is in 3 which is allowed, but K is possible, but must have S in 3,4,5. Here S is in 4 which is allowed. But N is in 3 which is allowed. But K is possible. But this is ""MONKS"" – letters M, O, N, K, S. O in 2, N in 3, S in 5. This seems valid:
- M O N K S
- O in 2 (correct).
- S in 5 (allowed).
- N in 3 (allowed).
- K is new letter to test.
- M is new letter to test.

But we need to ensure all letters are valid. ""MONKS"" is a valid word.

Another option: ""CONIC"" – but C is possible, but N is in 3, O in 2, S must be present. So no.

Another option: ""TONIC"" – missing S.

Another option: ""IONIC"" – missing S.

Another option: ""JONAS"" – J, A, S – A is out.

Another option: ""DONOS"" – D is out.

Another option: ""GONOS"" – G, N, O, S – but must be 5 letters with O in 2. So ""GONOS"" is 4 letters.

Another option: ""BOONS"" – B, O, O, N, S – but O is in 2, so second O is extra, and N is in 4 which is invalid.

Another option: ""COONS"" – C, O, O, N, S – same issue with N in 4.

Another option: ""FOONS"" – same issue.

Another option: ""HONKS"" – H, O, N, K, S – O in 2, N in 3, S in 5. This is valid:
- H O N K S
- H is new letter.
- K is new letter.
- N is in 3 (allowed).
- S is in 5 (allowed).

This seems better as ""HONKS"" is a common word.

Let me verify:
- H O N K S
- Position 2: O (correct).
- S is in 5 (allowed, since S must be in 3,4,5 and not in 1 or 2).
- N is in 3 (allowed, since N must not be in 4).
- H and K are new letters to test.

Thus, ""HONKS"" is a good next guess.Based on the feedback so far, we know:
- Position 2 is definitely O.
- S must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5.
- U and N are in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 respectively.
- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, D.

A word that satisfies these constraints is ""HONKS"":
- O is in position 2 (✓).
- S is in position 5 (allowed).
- N is in position 3 (allowed).
- H and K are new letters to test.",Guess 3: HONKS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) K(x) S(✓),FAIL

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For the first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize information gain. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. A good strategy is to pick a word with 3-4 vowels and 2-1 consonants, or vice versa, to test multiple letters efficiently.

Some strong opening words include:
- AROSE (covers A, R, O, S, E - 4 vowels, 1 consonant)
- SLATE (S, L, A, T, E - 3 vowels, 2 consonants)
- CRANE (C, R, A, N, E - 3 vowels, 2 consonants)

I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it tests 4 vowels and 1 very common consonant, giving us good coverage for the first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) – A is not in the word.
- R(x) – R is not in the word.
- O(-) – O is in the word but in the wrong place (currently at position 3).
- S(-) – S is in the word but in the wrong place (currently at position 4).
- E(x) – E is not in the word.

So we know:
- Letters definitely absent: A, R, E
- Letters present somewhere: O, S
- O and S must appear in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (since they’re not in position 3).

We need a word that:
1. Contains O and S (and no A, R, E).
2. Places O and S in different positions than 3.
3. Uses other common consonants to maximize information.

Possible letters to try next: T, N, L, I, C, D, U, M, P, etc.

Let’s pick a word that satisfies:
- O not in position 3
- S not in position 4
- Uses new common consonants

One good candidate is “SOUND”:
- S is in position 1 (new position for S)
- O is in position 2 (new position for O)
- U, N, D are new letters we haven’t tested yet

This gives us information about three new letters (U, N, D) while repositioning O and S.

Possible letters: from remaining unused consonants like T, M, P, etc. ""UOS_TN"" – need valid word.\n  - U in 4, N in 5: _ O S U N → need a letter for position 1. ""TOSUN"" is not a word, ""MOSUN"" – no, etc.\n\nTry S in position 4:\n- Word form: _ O _ S _\n- U must be in 1 or 5 (cannot be 3 or 4)\n- N must be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 4)\n- Possible combinations:\n  - U in 1, N in 3: U O N S _ → need a letter for position 5. ""UONST_"" – no valid word.\n  - U in 5, N in 1: N O U S _ → need a letter for position 4. ""NOUS_"" – ""NOUS"" plus a letter, but ""NOUSH"" – no, ""NOUS"" is 4 letters.\n\nTry S in position 5:\n- Word form: _ O _ _ S\n- U must be in 1 or 4 (cannot be 3)\n- N must be in 1 or 3 (cannot be 4)\n- Possible combinations:\n  - U in 1, N in 3: U O N _ S → need a letter for position 4. ""UON_T S"" – ""UONTS"" – no.\n  - U in 4, N in 1: N O U _ S → need a letter for position 3. ""NOU_S"" – ""NOUST"" – no.\n\nHmm, none of these seem to make valid words. Maybe we need to try different letters. Let’s think of actual words that fit:\n\nWe need:\n- O in position 2.\n- Must contain S, U, N.\n- S in 3, 4, or 5.\n- U not in 3, N not in 4.\n\nPossible word: ""FOIST"" – but F isn\'t tested yet, and I is unused. But we already know O is in position 2, so:\n- F O I S T – but N must be present. So no.\n\nNext: ""JOINT"" – but J is unused, and T is possible, but N is in 4 which is invalid.\n\nNext: ""POINT"" – P, I, N, T. O in 2, N in 4 – but N cannot be in 4. So invalid.\n\nNext: ""SOUND"" – already used.\n\nNext: ""UNION"" – but O is in 2, so:\n- U N I O N – but O is not in 2. So invalid.\n\nNext: ""SUNNY"" – but Y is possible, but N is in 4 which is invalid.\n\nNext: ""SUING"" – G is possible, but N is in 4 which is invalid.\n\nNext: ""SPOOK"" – P, K, but O is in 2, and K is possible, but N must be present. So no.\n\nNext: ""CLOUD"" – but D is out, and L is possible, but N must be present. So no.\n\nNext: ""BOUND"" – D is out.\n\nNext: ""FOULS"" – but L is possible, S in 5, N must be present. So no.\n\nNext: ""GONYS"" – G, Y, N, S, but O is in 2, N in 3, S in 5. But N is in 3 which is allowed (only restriction is N not in 4). But this is a valid word? ""GONYS"" is a plural of ""gonys"" (not common). Maybe not the best.\n\nNext: ""IONIC"" – but C is possible, but N is in 3, O in 2, but must have S. So no.\n\nNext: ""JONES"" – J, E, but E is out.\n\nNext: ""LUNAR"" – A is out, R is out.\n\nNext: ""MONKS"" – K is possible, but N is in 2 which is O. So no.\n\nNext: ""PONYS"" – P, Y, S, N in 4 which is invalid.\n\nNext: ""SONIC"" – C is possible, but N is in 3, O in 2, S in 1, but S cannot be in 1 (from SOUND feedback). So invalid.\n\nNext: ""TONIC"" – T, I, C. O in 2, N in 3, but must have S. So no.\n\nNext: ""VOINS"" – V, I, N, S. O in 2, N in 3, S in 5. This seems possible:\n- V O I N S – letters: V, O, I, N, S. \n- O is in 2 (correct).\n- S is in 5 (allowed, since S must be in 3,4,5 and 5 is ok).\n- N is in 3 (allowed, since N must not be in 4).\n- I is a new letter to test.\n- V is a new letter to test.\n\n""VOINS"" is a valid word (plural of ""vain"" in some contexts, or ""voin"" is a word in Russian, but in English it\'s acceptable).\n\nBut let me check if there\'s a more common word. ""VOINS"" might be obscure.\n\nAlternative: ""SONIC"" – but S is in 1 which is invalid.\n\nAlternative: ""PONYS"" – N is in 4 which is invalid.\n\nAlternative: ""FOIST"" – missing N.\n\nAlternative: ""JONES"" – E is invalid.\n\nAlternative: ""MONKS"" – missing E, and N is in 3 which is allowed, but K is possible, but must have S in 3,4,5. Here S is in 4 which is allowed. But N is in 3 which is allowed. But K is possible. But this is ""MONKS"" – letters M, O, N, K, S. O in 2, N in 3, S in 5. This seems valid:\n- M O N K S\n- O in 2 (correct).\n- S in 5 (allowed).\n- N in 3 (allowed).\n- K is new letter to test.\n- M is new letter to test.\n\nBut we need to ensure all letters are valid. ""MONKS"" is a valid word.\n\nAnother option: ""CONIC"" – but C is possible, but N is in 3, O in 2, S must be present. So no.\n\nAnother option: ""TONIC"" – missing S.\n\nAnother option: ""IONIC"" – missing S.\n\nAnother option: ""JONAS"" – J, A, S – A is out.\n\nAnother option: ""DONOS"" – D is out.\n\nAnother option: ""GONOS"" – G, N, O, S – but must be 5 letters with O in 2. So ""GONOS"" is 4 letters.\n\nAnother option: ""BOONS"" – B, O, O, N, S – but O is in 2, so second O is extra, and N is in 4 which is invalid.\n\nAnother option: ""COONS"" – C, O, O, N, S – same issue with N in 4.\n\nAnother option: ""FOONS"" – same issue.\n\nAnother option: ""HONKS"" – H, O, N, K, S – O in 2, N in 3, S in 5. This is valid:\n- H O N K S\n- H is new letter.\n- K is new letter.\n- N is in 3 (allowed).\n- S is in 5 (allowed).\n\nThis seems better as ""HONKS"" is a common word.\n\nLet me verify:\n- H O N K S\n- Position 2: O (correct).\n- S is in 5 (allowed, since S must be in 3,4,5 and not in 1 or 2).\n- N is in 3 (allowed, since N must not be in 4).\n- H and K are new letters to test.\n\nThus, ""HONKS"" is a good next guess.Based on the feedback so far, we know:\n- Position 2 is definitely O.\n- S must appear in positions 3, 4, or 5.\n- U and N are in the word but not in positions 3 or 4 respectively.\n- Letters not in the word: A, R, E, D.\n\nA word that satisfies these constraints is ""HONKS"":\n- O is in position 2 (✓).\n- S is in position 5 (allowed).\n- N is in position 3 (allowed).\n- H and K are new letters to test.\n\n<guess>HONKS</guess>'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Make a new 5-letter word guess.\n\nHere is some previous feedback: \nGuess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(x) O(-) S(-) E(x)\nGuess 2: SOUND -> FEEDBACK: S(-) O(✓) U(-) N(-) D(x)\nGuess 3: HONKS -> FEEDBACK: H(x) O(✓) N(✓) K(x) S(✓)\n'}]","<think>
From all feedback so far:

1. Position 2 is O (fixed).
2. Position 3 is N (fixed) — because N(-) in SOUND and then N(✓) in HONKS.
3. Position 5 is S (fixed) — because S(-) in SOUND, S(✓) in HONKS.
4. Letters confirmed present: O, N, S in their correct positions.
5. Letters confirmed absent: A, R, E, D, H, K.
6. Letters still in play (not yet ruled out) for positions 1 and 4: B, C, F, G, I, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y, etc.

We need a 5-letter word with:
- _ O N _ S
- Letters for positions 1 and 4 not yet excluded.

Also, from earlier:
- U is in the word but NOT in position 3 (which is already N) and NOT in position 3 (from SOUND). So U must be in position 1 or 4.

Let’s list possibilities:

Possible position 1: B, C, F, G, I, L, M, P, T, U, V, W, Y
Possible position 4: same list, but must be different from position 1 (since letters can repeat only if the word allows it, and we have no evidence of duplicates).

We also know U must appear exactly once (since it was marked (-) once) and must be in 1 or 4.

Let’s try U in position 1:
- U O N _ S → need a letter for position 4 that is not yet excluded. Possible letters: B, C, F, G, I, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y.
- Valid English words with this pattern: UON_T, UON_FS, etc. Real words: ""UONTS"" – none.

Try U in position 4:
- _ O N U S → need a letter for position 1. Possible letters: B, C, F, G, I, L, M, P, T, V, W, Y.
- Real words: ""BONUS"", ""CONUS"", ""FONUS"" – only ""BONUS"" is valid (5-letter word meaning ""in addition"").

Check constraints:
- B is not yet excluded.
- O, N, U, S are in correct positions.
- All letters used are either confirmed or newly tested.

Thus, ""BONUS"" is the logical next guess.
