### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters and vowels to maximize the information gained. The classic starting word ""SLATE"" is popular for this reason, as it includes common consonants (S, L, T) and two vowels (A, E). However, another strong choice is ""AROSE"" which contains all five of the most common letters in English words (A, R, O, S, E). I'll go with ""AROSE"" as it gives excellent coverage of high-frequency letters in both position and presence.

From the feedback on AROSE:
- A is in the word but in the wrong position (–).
- R is not in the word (x).
- O is in the correct position (✓) at position 3.
- S and E are not in the word (x).

So we know:
- The word has an O in the third position.
- It contains an A somewhere, but not in position 1.
- It does not contain R, S, or E.

Letters left to guess: positions 1, 2, 4, 5.
We need a word with O in position 3, an A somewhere else, and no R/S/E.
Good consonants still available: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, T, V, W, Y, etc.
Good vowels still available: I, U (since A is already known and O is in place).

Possible patterns:
- _ _ O _ _ (but O is fixed at position 3)
Actually, positions are: 1 2 3 4 5 with O at 3.
So word looks like: _ _ O _ _

We know A is in the word but not at position 1, so A could be at 2, 4, or 5.
We need to pick a word that fits:
- O at position 3
- Contains A not at position 1
- No R, S, E

Let’s try ""ADOPT"":
- A at position 1: but feedback says A is in wrong position (–), so this is invalid.
Next try ""COATI"":
- O at 3, A at 2, no R/S/E: valid.
But let’s check if COATI is a valid 5-letter word: yes, it’s a variant spelling of ""coat"" plus ""i"", but might be less common.

Better choice: ""CLOAK"":
- O at 3, A at 4, no R/S/E: valid and common.
But CLOAK has O at 3 and A at 4: fits all constraints.

Another good option: ""GLOAM"" (but not common).

Most common and valid: ""CLOAK"".

Wait, let’s verify:
C L O A T: positions 1-5.
O at 3: ✓
A at 4: allowed (not at position 1)
No R, S, E: ✓
CLOAK is a valid word.

I’ll go with CLOAK.
