### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants. 

Common 5-letter words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. Among these, ""AROSE"" contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English words. This should provide helpful feedback for future guesses regardless of the actual secret word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ROUTE → R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(-)

What we know so far:
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, S, U, T
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE)
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE)
- Also, from ROUTE, E cannot be in position 5 (same as before), and R and O still have their position restrictions.

We need a word that:
1. Contains exactly R, O, E (no repeats of any of these letters)
2. Places R somewhere other than position 2
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no A, S, U, T, and no other letters not yet tested)

Possible remaining consonants we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new consonants.

One straightforward candidate is ""ORDER"":
- Contains O, D, E, R
- But it has D and R, and we already know R is in the word. However, ""ORDER"" has two R's, which would mean the word has two R's. Is that possible? The rules don't forbid repeated letters, but we have no information yet about duplicates. Let's keep this in mind as a possible candidate.

Another candidate is ""REBID"":
- Contains R, E, B, I, D
- But this has E and R, but we need to place O somewhere as well, so this is invalid (missing O).

A better candidate is ""PERON"":
- Contains P, E, R, O, N
- Positions: P(1), E(2), R(3), O(4), N(5)
- Checks:
  - R is in position 3 (allowed, since restriction is only position 2)
  - O is in position 4 (allowed, since restriction is only position 3)
  - E is in position 2 (allowed, since restriction is only position 5)
  - No forbidden letters (A, S, U, T, etc.)
  - Introduces new letters P, N

This seems valid and provides good coverage.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants. 

Common 5-letter words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. Among these, ""AROSE"" contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English words. This should provide helpful feedback for future guesses regardless of the actual secret word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback: 
Guess 1: AROSE -> FEEDBACK: A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters present: R, O, E
- Their positions must avoid:
  - R cannot be in position 2
  - O cannot be in position 3
  - E cannot be in position 5

We need a new word that contains R, O, E and places them in allowed positions, while avoiding A and S. A good next word should test new positions for these letters and introduce others. ""ROUTE"" is a good candidate: it has R, O, E, tests position 1 for R, position 2 for O, and position 4 for E, while introducing U and T.

From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ROUTE → R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(-)

What we know so far:
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, S, U, T
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE)
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE)
- Also, from ROUTE, E cannot be in position 5 (same as before), and R and O still have their position restrictions.

We need a word that:
1. Contains exactly R, O, E (no repeats of any of these letters)
2. Places R somewhere other than position 2
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no A, S, U, T, and no other letters not yet tested)

Possible remaining consonants we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new consonants.

One straightforward candidate is ""ORDER"":
- Contains O, D, E, R
- But it has D and R, and we already know R is in the word. However, ""ORDER"" has two R's, which would mean the word has two R's. Is that possible? The rules don't forbid repeated letters, but we have no information yet about duplicates. Let's keep this in mind as a possible candidate.

Another candidate is ""REBID"":
- Contains R, E, B, I, D
- But this has E and R, but we need to place O somewhere as well, so this is invalid (missing O).

A better candidate is ""PERON"":
- Contains P, E, R, O, N
- Positions: P(1), E(2), R(3), O(4), N(5)
- Checks:
  - R is in position 3 (allowed, since restriction is only position 2)
  - O is in position 4 (allowed, since restriction is only position 3)
  - E is in position 2 (allowed, since restriction is only position 5)
  - No forbidden letters (A, S, U, T, etc.)
  - Introduces new letters P, N

This seems valid and provides good coverage.

Let me output this as the next guess.

Possible word: E O B C R → “EOBCR” is invalid.  
Possible word: E O B D R → “EOBDR” is invalid.  

Try O in 5: E _ _ _ O  

Then E is in 1, O in 5. R must go in 4 (cannot be 2,3).  
So word: E _ _ R O  

Need two consonants in 2,3.  
Possible word: E B C R O → “EBCRO” is invalid.  
Possible word: E B D R O → “EBDRO” is invalid.  
Possible word: E C D R O → “ECDRO” is invalid.  

Try R in 1: R _ _ _ _  

Then O must go in 2, 5 (cannot be 3,4).  
Try O in 2: R O _ _ _  

E must go in 3 or 4 (cannot be 2,5).  
Try E in 3: R O E _ _ → need two consonants in 4,5.  
Possible word: R O E B _ → “ROEB_” → “ROEBS” is invalid.  
Possible word: R O E C _ → “ROEC_” → “ROECE” is invalid.  
Possible word: R O E D _ → “ROED_” → “RODES” is invalid (but S is out).  
Possible word: R O E F _ → “ROEF_” → invalid.  
Possible word: R O E K _ → “ROEK_” → invalid.  

Try E in 4: R O _ E _ → need consonants in 3,5.  
Possible word: R O B E _ → “ROBE_” → “ROBEL” is invalid.  
Possible word: R O C E _ → “ROCE_” → invalid.  
Possible word: R O D E _ → “RODE_” → “RODES” is invalid.  

Try O in 5: R _ _ _ O  

Then E must go in 3 or 4 (cannot be 2,5).  
Try E in 3: R _ E _ O → need consonants in 2,4.  
Possible word: R B E C O → “RBECO” is invalid.  
Possible word: R D E C O → “RDECO” is invalid.  

Try E in 4: R _ _ E O → need consonants in 2,3.  
Possible word: R B C E O → “RBCEO” is invalid.  

Try R in 1, O in 5, E in 3: R _ E _ O → same as above.

Let’s try a different route: look for real words that fit the constraints.

Known: R, O, E must appear once each, no duplicates yet.

Possible word: “CROED” – invalid (not a word).  
Possible word: “CRORE” – invalid (double R, and R already placed).  
Possible word: “CROVE” – invalid.  
Possible word: “DROVE” – invalid (V not yet tested, but let’s see).  
Wait, “DROVE” has D, R, O, V, E – all letters not yet ruled out, and positions:  
D(1), R(2) – but R cannot be in 2. So invalid.  

Possible word: “FROZE” – invalid (Z not tested, but let’s check positions:  
F(1), R(2) – R cannot be in 2. Invalid.  

Possible word: “GROVE” – positions: G(1), R(2) – R cannot be in 2. Invalid.  

Possible word: “BROKE” – positions: B(1), R(2) – R cannot be in 2. Invalid.  

Possible word: “CROON” – invalid (double O, and N is out).  

Possible word: “CREEK” – invalid (double E).  

Possible word: “CREDO” – positions: C(1), R(2) – R cannot be in 2. Invalid.  

Possible word: “FLEER” – invalid (double E).  

Possible word: “FLOOR” – invalid (double O, R in 5).  

Possible word: “FLEOR” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s look for words with unique R, O, E.

Try: “CROVE” – not valid.  
Try: “DROVE” – invalid (R in 2).  
Try: “GROVE” – invalid (R in 2).  
Try: “BROVE” – invalid (R in 2).  
Try: “MORER” – invalid (double R).  

Try: “COMER” – positions: C(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), R(5).  
Check constraints:  
- Contains C, O, M, E, R – all required letters (R, O, E) are present.  
- R is in 5 – allowed (restriction was only position 2,3).  
- O is in 2 – allowed (restriction was 3,4).  
- E is in 4 – allowed (restriction was 2,5).  
- All other letters (C, M) are new and not yet ruled out.  

“COMER” is a valid English word. Let’s use this as the next guess.

### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

Since this is the first guess with no prior information, the optimal strategy is to choose a word that contains common letters to maximize the chance of getting useful feedback. A good starting word should include common vowels and consonants. 

Common 5-letter words like ""SLATE"", ""CRANE"", ""RAISE"", or ""AROSE"" are popular choices. Among these, ""AROSE"" contains 3 vowels (A, O, E) and 2 common consonants (R, S), which gives us good coverage of frequently used letters in English words. This should provide helpful feedback for future guesses regardless of the actual secret word.

Therefore, I'll go with ""AROSE"" as my first guess.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on AROSE:
- A(x) → A is not in the word.
- R(-) → R is in the word but not in position 2.
- O(-) → O is in the word but not in position 3.
- S(x) → S is not in the word.
- E(-) → E is in the word but not in position 5.

So we know:
- Letters present: R, O, E
- Their positions must avoid:
  - R cannot be in position 2
  - O cannot be in position 3
  - E cannot be in position 5

We need a new word that contains R, O, E and places them in allowed positions, while avoiding A and S. A good next word should test new positions for these letters and introduce others. ""ROUTE"" is a good candidate: it has R, O, E, tests position 1 for R, position 2 for O, and position 4 for E, while introducing U and T.

<|im_start|>assistant
From the two guesses we have:

Guess 1: AROSE → A(x) R(-) O(-) S(x) E(-)
Guess 2: ROUTE → R(-) O(-) U(x) T(x) E(-)

What we know so far:
- Letters that ARE in the word: R, O, E
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, S, U, T
- R cannot be in position 2 (from AROSE)
- O cannot be in position 3 (from AROSE)
- E cannot be in position 5 (from AROSE)
- Also, from ROUTE, E cannot be in position 5 (same as before), and R and O still have their position restrictions.

We need a word that:
1. Contains exactly R, O, E (no repeats of any of these letters)
2. Places R somewhere other than position 2
3. Places O somewhere other than position 3
4. Places E somewhere other than position 5
5. Uses only letters not yet ruled out (so no A, S, U, T, and no other letters not yet tested)

Possible remaining consonants we can still use: B, C, D, F, G, H, K, L, M, N, P, V, W, Y, etc.

Let’s try to construct a word that satisfies these constraints and introduces new consonants.

One straightforward candidate is ""ORDER"":
- Contains O, D, E, R
- But it has D and R, and we already know R is in the word. However, ""ORDER"" has two R's, which would mean the word has two R's. Is that possible? The rules don't forbid repeated letters, but we have no information yet about duplicates. Let's keep this in mind as a possible candidate.

Another candidate is ""REBID"":
- Contains R, E, B, I, D
- But this has E and R, but we need to place O somewhere as well, so this is invalid (missing O).

A better candidate is ""PERON"":
- Contains P, E, R, O, N
- Positions: P(1), E(2), R(3), O(4), N(5)
- Checks:
  - R is in position 3 (allowed, since restriction is only position 2)
  - O is in position 4 (allowed, since restriction is only position 3)
  - E is in position 2 (allowed, since restriction is only position 5)
  - No forbidden letters (A, S, U, T, etc.)
  - Introduces new letters P, N

This seems valid and provides good coverage.

Let me output this as the next guess.

From all feedback so far:

Known letters that ARE in the word: R, O, E  
Known letters that are NOT in the word: A, S, U, T, P, N  

Position restrictions:
- R ≠ position 2, 3  
- O ≠ position 3, 4  
- E ≠ position 2, 5  

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out):  
B, C, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, V, W, Y, plus the required R, O, E.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Contains exactly one each of R, O, E (no duplicates yet ruled out).
2. Places R only in positions 1, 4, 5 (but 5 is still open for E).
3. Places O only in positions 1, 2, 5 (since 3 and 4 are ruled out).
4. Places E only in positions 1, 3, 4 (since 2 and 5 are ruled out).

Let’s look for a valid placement:

Try O in position 1:  
O _ _ _ _  

Then E must go in 3 or 4, and R must go in 4 or 5.  
If E goes in 3: O _ E _ _ → need R in 4 or 5.  
Possible word: O B E R _ → “OBERT” is not valid.  
Possible word: O C E R _ → “OCER_” → “OCERS” is invalid.  
Possible word: O D E R _ → “ODER_” → “ODERS” is invalid.  
Possible word: O M E R _ → “OMER_” → “OMERS” is invalid.  

Try E in 1: E _ _ _ _  

Then O must go in 2, 5 (cannot be 3,4).  
Try O in 2: E O _ _ _  

R must go in 4 or 5 (cannot be 2,3).  
Try R in 4: E O _ R _ → need two consonants.  
Possible word: E O B R _ → “EOBR_” → “EOBRD” is invalid.  
Possible word: E O C R _ → “EOCR_” → “EOCRD” is invalid.  
Possible word: E O D R _ → “EODR_” → “EODRS” is invalid.  

Try R in 5: E O _ _ R  

Then O is in 2, E in 1, R in 5. Need two consonants in 3,4.  
Possible word: E O B C R → “EOBCR” is invalid.  
Possible word: E O B D R → “EOBDR” is invalid.  

Try O in 5: E _ _ _ O  

Then E is in 1, O in 5. R must go in 4 (cannot be 2,3).  
So word: E _ _ R O  

Need two consonants in 2,3.  
Possible word: E B C R O → “EBCRO” is invalid.  
Possible word: E B D R O → “EBDRO” is invalid.  
Possible word: E C D R O → “ECDRO” is invalid.  

Try R in 1: R _ _ _ _  

Then O must go in 2, 5 (cannot be 3,4).  
Try O in 2: R O _ _ _  

E must go in 3 or 4 (cannot be 2,5).  
Try E in 3: R O E _ _ → need two consonants in 4,5.  
Possible word: R O E B _ → “ROEB_” → “ROEBS” is invalid.  
Possible word: R O E C _ → “ROEC_” → “ROECE” is invalid.  
Possible word: R O E D _ → “ROED_” → “RODES” is invalid (but S is out).  
Possible word: R O E F _ → “ROEF_” → invalid.  
Possible word: R O E K _ → “ROEK_” → invalid.  

Try E in 4: R O _ E _ → need consonants in 3,5.  
Possible word: R O B E _ → “ROBE_” → “ROBEL” is invalid.  
Possible word: R O C E _ → “ROCE_” → invalid.  
Possible word: R O D E _ → “RODE_” → “RODES” is invalid.  

Try O in 5: R _ _ _ O  

Then E must go in 3 or 4 (cannot be 2,5).  
Try E in 3: R _ E _ O → need consonants in 2,4.  
Possible word: R B E C O → “RBECO” is invalid.  
Possible word: R D E C O → “RDECO” is invalid.  

Try E in 4: R _ _ E O → need consonants in 2,3.  
Possible word: R B C E O → “RBCEO” is invalid.  

Try R in 1, O in 5, E in 3: R _ E _ O → same as above.

Let’s try a different route: look for real words that fit the constraints.

Known: R, O, E must appear once each, no duplicates yet.

Possible word: “CROED” – invalid (not a word).  
Possible word: “CRORE” – invalid (double R, and R already placed).  
Possible word: “CROVE” – invalid.  
Possible word: “DROVE” – invalid (V not yet tested, but let’s see).  
Wait, “DROVE” has D, R, O, V, E – all letters not yet ruled out, and positions:  
D(1), R(2) – but R cannot be in 2. So invalid.  

Possible word: “FROZE” – invalid (Z not tested, but let’s check positions:  
F(1), R(2) – R cannot be in 2. Invalid.  

Possible word: “GROVE” – positions: G(1), R(2) – R cannot be in 2. Invalid.  

Possible word: “BROKE” – positions: B(1), R(2) – R cannot be in 2. Invalid.  

Possible word: “CROON” – invalid (double O, and N is out).  

Possible word: “CREEK” – invalid (double E).  

Possible word: “CREDO” – positions: C(1), R(2) – R cannot be in 2. Invalid.  

Possible word: “FLEER” – invalid (double E).  

Possible word: “FLOOR” – invalid (double O, R in 5).  

Possible word: “FLEOR” – invalid.  

Wait, let’s look for words with unique R, O, E.

Try: “CROVE” – not valid.  
Try: “DROVE” – invalid (R in 2).  
Try: “GROVE” – invalid (R in 2).  
Try: “BROVE” – invalid (R in 2).  
Try: “MORER” – invalid (double R).  

Try: “COMER” – positions: C(1), O(2), M(3), E(4), R(5).  
Check constraints:  
- Contains C, O, M, E, R – all required letters (R, O, E) are present.  
- R is in 5 – allowed (restriction was only position 2,3).  
- O is in 2 – allowed (restriction was 3,4).  
- E is in 4 – allowed (restriction was 2,5).  
- All other letters (C, M) are new and not yet ruled out.  

“COMER” is a valid English word. Let’s use this as the next guess.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the latest feedback (COMER → C(x) O(-) M(x) E(✓) R(✓)) we now know:

- Letters that ARE in the word: E (position 4) and R (position 5) → so the word ends in “ER”.
- Letters that are NOT in the word: A, S, U, T, P, N, C, M.

Positions fixed so far:
- Position 4: E
- Position 5: R

Letters still allowed (not yet ruled out): B, D, F, G, H, I, K, L, V, W, Y, plus the required E and R.

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Ends in “ER”.
2. Uses only letters from the allowed set.
3. Contains no duplicates of E or R (since they are already placed once and no info suggests duplicates).

Possible candidates:
- B + any 3 letters + ER → e.g., BIDER, FIDER, GIVER, HIVER, LIVER, WIDER.
- D + any 3 letters + ER → e.g., DIVER, DRIVE, FIVER, GIVER.
- F + any 3 letters + ER → e.g., FIVER.
- G + any 3 letters + ER → e.g., GIVER.
- H + any 3 letters + ER → e.g., HIVER.
- L + any 3 letters + ER → e.g., LIVER.
- V + any 3 letters + ER → e.g., VIGER (not a word), VIWER (not 5 letters ending ER).
- W + any 3 letters + ER → e.g., WIDER.

Among these, real English words include: DIVER, FIVER, GIVER, HIVER, LIVER, WIDER.

Let’s pick one that uses common letters and hasn’t been tried yet. “LIVER” is a good choice (L, I, V not yet tested).

Check constraints:
- L I V E R → letters are all allowed and no duplicates of E or R. Positions: E in 4, R in 5 correct.

So the next guess is LIVER.

All five letters so far are now locked:

- Position 4 = E  
- Position 5 = R  

Letters we know are NOT in the word (x’s):  
A, S, U, T, P, N, C, M, L, I, V  

Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out):  
B, D, F, G, H, K, O (but O has been “-” in earlier feedback, so it is in the word somewhere), W, Y  

We still must include O somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since it was marked “-” in AROSE and ROUTE, meaning it exists but was not in those spots).  
Positions ruled out for O:  
- NOT position 3 (from AROSE)  
- NOT position 3 or 4 (from ROUTE)  
So O must be in position 1 or 2.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ER” that:
- Contains O in position 1 or 2  
- Uses only the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, K, O, W, Y)

Candidate endings (positions 1-3) + “ER”:
- O _ _ ER → e.g., OBEER (invalid), OLDER (invalid), OGEER (invalid)  
- _ O _ ER → e.g., B O X E R (invalid), D O N E R (invalid), F O X E R (invalid), H O X E R (invalid), K O X E R (invalid), W O X E R (invalid)

Real English words that fit:
- OLDEN → ends in N, not R → invalid  
- OBESE → ends in E, not R → invalid  
- OCEAN → invalid letters  
- ONEIR → invalid letters  
- OUTER → U is invalid  
- PETER → P is invalid  
- WOKEN → invalid letters  
- WORSE → S is invalid  
- YOKER → Y, O, K, E, R → letters allowed, ends in ER, O in position 2

Check YOKER:
- Y O K E R  
- Letters: Y, O, K, E, R — all allowed  
- Positions: E in 4, R in 5 correct  
- O in 2 — allowed (not ruled out for position 2)  
- No duplicates of E or R

Therefore, YOKER is the logical next guess.

- Position 5 = R  

Letters we know are NOT in the word (x’s):  
A, S, U, T, P, N, C, M, L, I, V  

Allowed letters left (not yet ruled out):  
B, D, F, G, H, K, O (but O has been “-” in earlier feedback, so it is in the word somewhere), W, Y  

We still must include O somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since it was marked “-” in AROSE and ROUTE, meaning it exists but was not in those spots).  
Positions ruled out for O:  
- NOT position 3 (from AROSE)  
- NOT position 3 or 4 (from ROUTE)  
So O must be in position 1 or 2.

We need a 5-letter word ending in “ER” that:
- Contains O in position 1 or 2  
- Uses only the remaining letters (B, D, F, G, H, K, O, W, Y)

Candidate endings (positions 1-3) + “ER”:
- O _ _ ER → e.g., OBEER (invalid), OLDER (invalid), OGEER (invalid)  
- _ O _ ER → e.g., B O X E R (invalid), D O N E R (invalid), F O X E R (invalid), H O X E R (invalid), K O X E R (invalid), W O X E R (invalid)

Real English words that fit:
- OLDEN → ends in N, not R → invalid  
- OBESE → ends in E, not R → invalid  
- OCEAN → invalid letters  
- ONEIR → invalid letters  
- OUTER → U is invalid  
- PETER → P is invalid  
- WOKEN → invalid letters  
- WORSE → S is invalid  
- YOKER → Y, O, K, E, R → letters allowed, ends in ER, O in position 2

Check YOKER:
- Y O K E R  
- Letters: Y, O, K, E, R — all allowed  
- Positions: E in 4, R in 5 correct  
- O in 2 — allowed (not ruled out for position 2)  
- No duplicates of E or R  
- Real word.

Therefore, YOKER is the logical next guess.",Guess 6: YOKER -> FEEDBACK: Y(x) O(-) K(x) E(✓) R(✓),FAIL
