### Game Rules:
- You have **6 tries** to guess a secret **5-letter** word.
- Each guess must be a valid **5-letter English word**.
- After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating how close your guess was.

### Feedback Format:
Each letter in your guess will receive one of three symbols:
1. ✓ : The letter is in the word and in the CORRECT position.
2. - : The letter is in the word but in the WRONG position.
3. x : The letter is NOT in the word.

### Example:
Secret Word: BRISK

Guess 1: STORM -> Feedback: S(-) T(x) O(x) R(-) M(x)
Guess 2: BRAVE -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) A(x) V(x) E(x)
Guess 3: BRISK -> Feedback: B(✓) R(✓) I(✓) S(✓) K(✓)

### Response Format:
Think through the problem and feedback step by step. Make sure to first add your step-by-step thought process within <think> </think> tags. Then, return your guessed word in the following format: <guess> guessed-word </guess>.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these. A good starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters, and it gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Definitely contains E.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
- E cannot be in the 5th position (since that’s where it was in SLATE).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N.
- The letter E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.

That leaves us with consonants like B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels I, U (plus E which we know is present).

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Contains E (and puts it in a new position: 1, 2, or 3).
2. Uses as many new consonants as possible.

Good candidates are words like “MIDGE” (but D and G are okay), “HIBER” (but R is already ruled out), “WIELD” (L is ruled out), etc.

A solid choice is “MIDGE”:
- Letters: M, I, D, G, E.
- E is in position 5, but we know E can’t be in 5, so this is invalid.

Next option: “WIELD” – L is out.

Next: “PIECE” – C is out.

Next: “HONEY” – O is out.

Next: “BEGUM” – uses B, E, G, U, M. E is in position 2, and all letters are new. This works.

So I’ll guess “BEGUM”.

G (somewhere other than position 3)

So the secret word looks like:  
_ E _ _ _  
and must contain G somewhere (positions 1, 4, or 5).

Remaining unused common consonants: D, F, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z  
Remaining unused vowels: I

We need a 5-letter word that:
1. Has E in position 2.
2. Contains G (not in position 3).
3. Uses only letters not yet ruled out.

Candidate words:
- DEFIY – but Y isn’t ruled out yet, and F, I, Y are new.
- HEFTY – H, F, T, Y; but T is already ruled out.
- PEGGY – P, G, G; but G would be in positions 3 and 4, and we don’t know if G appears once or twice.
- VEXED – V, X, D; but E is already fixed in position 2, and VEXED has E in position 4, which would contradict our locked-in E in position 2.
- WIELD – L is ruled out.
- JIGGY – J, I, G, G; positions: J I G G Y. E is not in position 2 here, so this is invalid.

The simplest valid word that fits is “PEGGY”:
- P, E, G, G, Y
- E is in position 2 (locked).
- Contains G (positions 3 and 4), and we have no evidence that G appears only once.
- All letters are from the remaining pool.

However, to avoid assuming G appears twice, a better choice is “WIELD” but L is ruled out. Next best is “HEXED” but X and D are okay, and E is in position 2. But “HEXED” has E in position 4, which would conflict with our known E in position 2.

Realizing that, the correct approach is to pick a word with E in position 2 and G in position 1, 4, or 5. The word “DEFGY” isn’t valid. The valid word is “DEFGY” doesn’t exist. 

Valid words with E in position 2 and G in position 1, 4, or 5:
- G E _ _ _  – but G can’t be in position 1 because we know G is not in position 3, but could be 1. However, no evidence against G in 1.
- _ E G _ _  – but G can’t be in 3, so this is invalid.
- _ E _ G _  – valid, e.g., “PIGGY” but P is okay, I is okay, G in 4, Y okay.
- _ E _ _ G  – valid, e.g., “PIGGY” again.

But “PIGGY” has G in 3 and 4, which is allowed since we only know G isn’t in 3, but could be in 4.

However, the simplest and most likely valid word is “PIGGY” but P is unused, I is unused, G in 4 is allowed.

But let’s pick a word with G in position 1 to maximize information:
- G E _ _ _  – possible, e.g., “GELLY” but L is ruled out.

Next option: G in 4, word _ E _ G _:
- “D E I G H” – but H is okay, I is okay, D is okay. The word “DEIGH” is valid (archaic past tense of “deck” or “adorn”, but may be obscure).

Better: “F E I G A” – but A is ruled out.

Next: “K E E G Y” – invalid.

Next: “D E E G Y” – invalid.

Next: “H E E G Y” – invalid.

Realizing that, a valid common word is “W E E G Y” – but W, E, E, G, Y. E is in 2, G in 4, but has double E which may not be optimal.

Best is “W E E G Y” – but double E.

Actually, the simplest valid common word fitting is “WIELD” but L is out.

Next: “W I E G E” – invalid.

Realizing, the valid word is “W E I G H” – but H is okay, I is okay, W is okay. The word “WEIGH”:
- W E I G H
- E in position 2 (locked).
- G in position 4 (allowed, since G is not in 3).
- All letters W, I, H are unused.

This is a valid and informative guess.

So the next guess is “WEIGH”.

For my first guess, I want to choose a word that has common letters to maximize the information gained. The most common letters in English are E, A, R, O, T, L, N, S, I, C. I'll pick a word that uses some of these. A good starting word is ""SLATE"" because it contains S, L, A, T, E - all very common letters, and it gives good coverage of vowels and consonants. This should help me quickly identify which letters are in the secret word and their possible positions.

Here is some previous feedback:

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
From the feedback on SLATE:
- S, L, A, T are NOT in the word (x).
- E is in the word but in the wrong position (-).

So the secret word:
- Definitely contains E.
- Does NOT contain S, L, A, T.
- E cannot be in the 5th position (since that’s where it was in SLATE).

I need a 5-letter word without S, L, A, T, but including E somewhere other than the last position. To maximize new information, I’ll pick a word with fresh common consonants. Good remaining common consonants are R, N, C, H, B, M, P, etc. I’ll try “CRONE”:
- Contains E (and places it in 4th position, satisfying the “wrong position” clue).
- Uses new letters C, R, O, N (none of which were in SLATE).

So far we know:
- Letters NOT in the word: S, L, A, T, C, R, O, N.
- The letter E is in the word but not in positions 4 or 5.

That leaves us with consonants like B, D, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z and vowels I, U (plus E which we know is present).

To maximize information, I want a word that:
1. Contains E (and puts it in a new position: 1, 2, or 3).
2. Uses as many new consonants as possible.

Good candidates are words like “MIDGE” (but D and G are okay), “HIBER” (but R is already ruled out), “WIELD” (L is ruled out), etc.

A solid choice is “MIDGE”:
- Letters: M, I, D, G, E.
- E is in position 5, but we know E can’t be in 5, so this is invalid.

Next option: “WIELD” – L is out.

Next: “PIECE” – C is out.

Next: “HONEY” – O is out.

Next: “BEGUM” – uses B, E, G, U, M. E is in position 2, and all letters are new. This works.

So I’ll guess “BEGUM”.

G (cannot be in positions 3 or 4, so G must be in position 1 or 5)

Vowels still available: none except E are used so far, but E is already placed.

Consonants still available: D, F, J, K, P, Q, V, X, Y, Z

We need a 5-letter word with pattern:
- G E _ _ _  (if G is in position 1)
- _ E _ _ G  (if G is in position 5)

Let’s try G in position 1 first because it gives us more options for the remaining letters:
G E _ _ _

Remaining letters to fill positions 3,4,5 must come from the unused set {D,F,J,K,P,Q,V,X,Y,Z} and must form a valid word.

Possible valid words starting with GE:
- GEDDY – but D is allowed, Y is allowed, but double D may be less informative.
- GEEKY – K and Y are allowed.
- GELLY – L is ruled out.
- GEMMY – M is ruled out.
- GENEY – N is ruled out.
- GEPHY – H is ruled out.
- GERYM – M is ruled out.

The only common valid word among these is “GEEKY”.

Check letters:
G, E, E, K, Y  
- G in position 1 (allowed)  
- E in position 2 (locked)  
- K and Y are both unused so far  
- No ruled-out letters

Therefore, “GEEKY” is a valid and informative next guess.

Letters ruled OUT:

Letters confirmed IN and their positions:  
E is fixed in position 2 ( _ E _ _ _ )

Letters confirmed IN but whose exact positions are still unknown:
